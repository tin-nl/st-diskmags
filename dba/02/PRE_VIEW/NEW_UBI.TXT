3X NEW FROM UBI SOFT

WINTER HIGHLIGHT FROM UBI SOFT...

Well UBI Soft are real busy these day's. The are bound to get out
3 new games at the end of this year. They are called Lightquest,
Starush and B.A.T. 2. We look a little closer to each title.

Lightquest is a jump and run game. Trough a fairytale world jumps,
flies and fights your figure. This can be a warrior, magician or a
will-o-the-wisp, you control to free the world from the bad witch
Zora. It depents on the figure you choose what type of game it is,
action or more puzzle. The game has some very nice music and nice
backgrounds.

A real shoot'em up is Starush. In a far far away planetsystem there are
12 great monsters to be killed.Most of the time moving obstacle's
and making life difficult for you. But you can also play this game with two
players at the same time to make things a lot easier. But playing with
two don't forget, if you try to get one of the many bonuses that float around
don't forget the enemy. And ofcourse at the end of each level there is
one of the big end level monsters waiting for you. It looks good and it
isn't easy to play, so keep a look out for it.

Third and last of the new games is B.A.T.2. It looks much more impressive
then B.A.T. The are three fases to be played to free the planet Shedishan.
Many tactical options and (free to play) games inbetween makes this one
a good start for those among us that are new with these type of games.
The graphix look real good, so wait and see.....
