OCEAN COMPILATION

Compilation of 3 ocean hits.

Ocean will release a compilation of their 3 best conversions on 
the ST. They are all of the same kind, level,ladder and jump games. But
they are all fun to play.

 The compilation contains:

-The Newzealand Story, a level and jump and run game with big scrolling
 screens and a little yellow bird you must control.

-Bubble Bobble, playing a little dinosaures ( 1 or 2 players) in many
 different screens filled with munsters and fruit !!

-Rainbow Islands,  this time you are a little boy jumping from one platform
 to another by making rainbows between them. Again with lots of tricky 
 monsters that will keep you from succeeding

Well we all know these titles more or less so you can expect some
good games for the price of one. O.K. these games are all a bit out
dated but their still a great fun to play, even for younger kids.
There isn't as much fighting and hack/slaughting in it, so parents can
say that these games aren't good for your education or something like that.
So if you still don't have one of these games, this could be your
change to get them...
