ANCO COMPILATION

ANCO SOCCER COMPILATION.

If you are a real soccer fan then you must read this one. The ANCO
house thought to be smart by releasing a compilation of only 
soccer games. Well since you can't play soccer outside in the winter
you now can kick the balls out of your computer ( in speech ofcourse )
The compilations name is "FOOTBALL CRAZY" and it features three
football games, well not exactly three. One of them is a data disk
for the other but, okay. Here are the titles:

Kick off 2 - Well if you are that football fan you probably know
it already, cause it's the best soccer game ever made for a computer
and i ain't the only person who says so. The players may seem a little
small but you can play this one a a tremendouss speed. It scrolls smooth
even looks like it uses the whole screen (without the borders i mean)
and it just great fun to play. Looking on the playfield from above you
get a good view of what is happening on the green field. And for this
gem in football games the have inclosed a data disk called:

The Final Whistle - Even more options for this game, so it's
really complete now...

And third in a row is Player Manager, not my favorite but still a good
game if you like the more in-active form of the football sport. Setting
up tactics, choosing players and all that kind of stuff is what  
you can do and trying ofcourse to get your team to victory....

So as said, this is one for the real football freaks. But if you aren't
well known with these kind of games here is a good change to do so. It
will be a very good start...
