OUTRUN EUROPE

OUTRUN EUROPE, FINALLY ????

Well there is lots of talk of this game and nobody knows anything
for sure. The demo version sofar has only got two tracks, and the
whole things plays in good old England. Here also starts one of the 
two scenarios. One very big change, there isn't a Ferrari anymore but
now you are driving a powerfull motercycle. You drive over the "Hammer
Smith Flyover" to the center of Londen making new speedrecords. Even
the good old English taxi's drive in this game a good 160 Km/h, altough
it seems a little bit strange to me. But even then the Porsches, Fiesta's
(????) and Cosworths will still give you a hard time to set a record by
driving you almost from the road. If you don't make it, you can start all
over again.
The second scenario you will find yourself in the middle of the Northsea
driving a water bike. There are as always lots of things trying to get
you down the drain and even the Police is trying from the sky to make
live bad for you...

Overall Outrun Europe looks good, the joystick control is fine and accurate
so that you can control your machine quite good. And you better can or
else you won't be in time. The release date will still remain a well 
kept secret just as the rest of the game.
