SEGA COMPILATION

SEGA/U.S.GOLD COMPILATION.

It's probably very near to Christmas time if you judge the number of
compilations we have this month. I lost count to be honest, but okay
here is another one. This time it's a compilation of five games,but
special about this one is that all of these games are different. I
mean types of games. So here they come:

Super Monaco G.P. - A racing game, and quite a nice one. It has good
animation, graphix and some very nice 3d features. So the first one
seems to okay, so here comes number two,

Golden Axe - A very good conversion of an level hack and jump game.
Good looking graphix, two player mode, just fun to play. So now it's
up to number three,

Crack Down - Another conversion of one of the better arcade games. A
real no-nonsens blasting game, again playable by two players. A real
buy for the arcade addicts i would say.  Number four is...

Eswat - Again a conversion of a space-bit police game. A vertical
blasting game and a good conversion. And last but least,

Shinobi - Ninja game if you like, but one of the better kind. Very 
good playability, very close conversion, graphix could have been better
but if you play it good you will like it anyway.

So if you want to have/buy a compilation with lots of different games
just to play them all, here is your change. A nice present for Christmas
maybe.
