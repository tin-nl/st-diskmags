MAX ACTION COMPIL

MAX ACTION COMPILATION.

Yep another compilation of games on disk and this time it's from
U.S. Gold. MAX stand for Maximum Action Xtra ( NO i didn't type extra 
wrong it should be like that !). It's a compilation of four (4) mainly
good games. Three shoot em up's and one level and ladder game. The titles
in this compilation are:

Turrican II - A great shoot em up with very nice graphix, lots of levels
              and very special music converted by Jochem Hippel better
              know to you as Mad Max. This game isn't even very old yet
              so it still is a good buy only for this game.
ST Dragon   - The second shoot em up, this time no space ship or spaceman
              but you riding a dragon. Nice graphix, good gameplay, but
              then again we have lots of it.
S.W.IV      - Maybe better known as Silk Worm 4. Altough i liked Silk Worm 1
              a lot more it still is a good horizontal scrolling shoot em up
              game. Even playable with two players.
Night Shift - This is the level and ladder game, and you are a little 
              worker in an factory trying to get things done. The job is
              to assemble Star Wars puppets, and it ain't easy. Nice game
              if you like this kind and it makes the compilation complete.

So it looks like a nice buy, good value for money cause it aren't very old
and already ten times ripped off games. So if you want four games for the
price of one, here it is...

                                                Bonus Software.
