OCEAN FIGHT COMPIL

STAND LIKE A MAN AND FIGHT,

Get in front of your computer, cause here is another one of Oceans compilations
and this time it's fighting time. This is a powerfull traid in one pack,
addicted to fun, well as they claim. But when you look at the titles
they even may be right this once. They have choosen three of the best/nice
games that are around. The three titles are:

Double Dragon - A oldie, yes thats true because II is already out a while
and part III is almost ready to be released. So this one is outdated, but if 
they made two new sequels to it, it should be good don't you think. Again
nice feature's, 2 player options, which makes live a lot easier if you
want to finish this game...

Shadow Warrior - One of many, but one of the better Ninja games. Very
nice graphix, good big sprites, various moves and good gameplay makes
this one a good buy on its own, let alone in a good compilation as this.

Dragon Ninja - Another good and nice ninja alike game with some big
nice sprites, fast action, heavy opponents, nice backdrops (Big trucks)
and good controls. So just sitdown and play...

So fight night freaks, if you still aren't defeated yet come and try
your luck on this compilation and try to finish your computer for good.

                                   Bonus Software.
