Did you know that,

* There is a hidden screen in the D.B.A. magazine 1 ?

* This hidden screen is a combination of two buttons on the main
  keyboard( not the numb.key's or the arrow keys ) ! You must first
  find the access screen to input the key combination !

* You can find the access under the options, and you must try and do one
  combination at the time( well you see what i mean when you try it ).
  Just watch the messagebox below very carefully when you go searching for
  the input screen.

* You can only change the set palette colors after you turned the raster-
  colors off( this is for the people who didn't know that ) !

* The scrolling will go smoother if you turn the rastercolors off.

* There are some new features in the magazine ? The magazine will load
  much faster and has a clock telling you how long you are reading !?

* Some bugs are solved and the magazine will also run now on 512 ST's.

* If your mouse is broke, you can always use Alternate, insert and the
  cursorkeys ??
