Last time i had a talk with Ecto 1. I hope it was a little bit inter-
esting for you. Of somebody i have heard it was to personal. He was
very afraid for an interview with me! You are really poor guys !
So, now an interview again. ( You can feast maybe!? ) Read it when
you're a little bit curious now! O, you want to know who the guy
name is? It's Mister Slimer! So read his nice or strange answers!


1. So tell me something about yourself, please......

Well, what can i say ? I'm 21 years old and almost 2 metres tall( normal
posture ), weighing between 77 and 80 kilo's, looking very ugly and mean.
Now some specifications for the girls, i've got blue eyes and dark blond
hair( almost black ) !
I shave my self with a big buthers knife using no shavingsoap at all !
Hobbies: I love to listen to all sorts of music( currently plays Queen with
the song Radio Ga Ga), playing around with my ST, i like to fool around with
people, i love a good conversation and women, watching movies and a view
other things( but i like to talk in private about that, with you ).
I always try to do a imitation of Rambo, but i'm really a very friendly guy.
I'm also a bit of a rebel, coz' i dont like to do things that other people
say to me, that's one of the reason's why i get kicked out of every job !!
Well, i think that's more then enough about myself.
There is a lot more, but i dont want to spoil the fun for some girls i know.

2. Which plans do you have for the D.B.A. ?

I like to see that our magazine will be the best around and i like more
women in the D.B.A. magazine team.
We have a view surpises left for the future, ya' have to wait.
D.B.A. ruleeeezzzzzzz........

3. Which plans do you have for the future in your personal life ??

Not much to be very honest, i'm not a big future planner.
Well, maybe i try to find me a new girly, but not the first view months to
come, so i had to refuse a lot of offers !!!( ha, ha, ha )

4. What in the world is keeping you very busy ??

A lot, i think much about life and the world around me.
The real things that scare me are disease's like Cancer and AIDS.
Problems like pollution and foreingers are also a lot on my mind.

5. How do you think about marriage between your mother and your best friend
   of 19 years old ??

What a strange question, coz' i don't even have a friend of 19 years old.
But okay, I probably beat him up real bad( no kidding ) and i never visit
my mother again......

6. When you have a free day, what do you really like to do then.

I would say come over and i show you( I know that she' dont like me saying
such things, but as i have mentioned before i like to fool around with
people ).
Seriously do, listing to music and playing with my ST, visit people, or just
relax by doing nothing at all !
I love making trips to big events about computers, cars, Hi-Fi stuff and a
lot of other things that intrest me.
But i have never enough money to do the things i really like.

7. What are the most stupid words you have ever heard ??

That a tough one.......let me think.
I heard someone say: I'm gone buy myself a couple of Bose 301 speakers
coz' i've heard that they are great(  a real dumb lamer ).

8. At last....Do you want to say something to other members of the D.B.A. ?

Bonus, your a great coder, altough we always have comment on your work.
But that is always ment positively !!
Ms. Angel, Do you know a girl for me who is around 1.60 metres tall and has
blond hair, looks pretty and is around my age ????
K.G.E. Your quite okay too.......i think !
Vigo, thanks for driving us, altough your not as fast as Bonus !
Ecto, are you really that busy al the time ??
Slimer, do you know that you are a great guy, i love you !!
Lets blow the top, Slimer has gone for a drink..........
