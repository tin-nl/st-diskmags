                      ===========================

Are you good in making graphics? Well, send all your work to us and we will 
insert it in the pictures corner. You may draw everything you want. Also logo's
(D.B.A. or your own) and fonts. If we think we can use something of your
work for D.B.A. intro's or demo's, then we will contact you. 

This time we have received some graphics from Sandman of Flash in Finland, 
T.G.E. from I.C.E. in Holland and Cyberpunk of Network in Norway (some 
graphics from a game he is making !!). Nice work don't you think? So send
your own graphics to us, and we will place it in a next issue of this
magazine.

I am looking forward to see some nice work!

Greetings from Ecto 1 of D.B.A.
