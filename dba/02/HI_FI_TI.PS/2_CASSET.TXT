Hello and welcome once again to our HI-FI section in our beloved magazine.
This second time i am gone give you some ideas what cassette types you
can choose of.
There are a lot of types on the market, but are they all that good ?!

Okay, I don't speak about normal position tapes, because if you want to
make good recordings you must use at least chrome tapes !

Before we begin something else first:

Don't read this stuff when ya don't own a decent cassettedeck, this means
midisets, cheap cassettedeck from technics, philips, yoko, supertech, sony
under the price of 400 guilders.
You can't hear the differents anyway on that sort of cheap decks !!
We start of with the chrome tapes..........

***************************************************************************

Type: II ( CrO2 )
Name: Sony UX-S
Value for money: 9+

Sony is one of the best tape manufacturers in this world.
This sound unbelievable because you probably thought that TDK was the best.
TDK is the biggest and are not bad, but in quality I think that Sony is
a ( little ) bit better.

Okay I have a view UX-S tapes at home and I must say they are excellent.
The tape is still very good after a couple of years( this was ofcourse a
older type of UX-S).
Please do not use this tape in your car, coz' it can't stand high tempratures.
Some very good points are that the tape is very 'noise' free and has a very
good dynamic output.
The tape is not expensive and is one of the better chrome tapes around.
Just buy one and test it on your tapedeck.

***************************************************************************

  TIP:   Check on what tape brand your deck is adjusted.
         Most deck manufacturers use their own tapes to install 
         your tapedeck with !
         You can let the manufacturer change your tapedeck to another
         type of cassette tape.

***************************************************************************

Type: II ( CrO2 )
Name: TDK (new) SA-X
Value for money: 9

TDK is the biggest cassette producer in the world !

The TDK SA-X is a tape that is in production for years now, TDK has made
a lot of different SA-X tapes till this time, still trying to improve them.
They make very good tapes for a very low price.
If you make a recording on this tape, it will last for years to come.
The tape has a low noise rate and a very good cassette mechanism.
All chrome tapes of TDK are very good, so you always buy something of very
high quality.

***************************************************************************

TIP:  CLEAN YOUR TAPEDECK AFTER EVERY 20 HOURS OF PLAYING/RECORDING TIME.
      USE NO CLEANING TAPES BUT A COTTON-TIPPED STICK MOISTENED IN GOOD
      QUALITY ALCOHOL OR CLEAINING FLUIDS FROM THE HI-FI SHOP.
      USE A ELECTRONIC DEMAGNISATION CASSETTE AFTER CLEANING THE RECORD/PLAY
      ERASE HEADS, CAPSTAN('S) AND PINCH ROLLER.
      THE DEMAG. CASSETTE WILL KEEP YOUR PLAY/RECORDING HEAD IN GOOD CONDITION.

***************************************************************************

Type: II ( CrO2 )
Name: Denon HD 8
Value for money: 8-

This is what I call a good tape !!!!!
The Denon HD 8 is a little bit expensive( that why the 8- )but is the best
chrome tape of all the others.
In the chrome tape are metal particles giving the tape that extra boost that
it needs !!
It seems that Sony is the producer of the tape and Denon of the cassette
house.
In tests( in the German Magazine Stereo ) the only remarks where, the price
and the fact that the stickers aren't big enough.

The latest news is that Denon will launch a new tape from around 18 guilders
that will beat the Basf tape of 45 guilders !!

***************************************************************************

Denon tapes are only sold by good HI-FI shops !!

***************************************************************************

                             WARNING !!!!

ALWAYS PUT TAPE'S BACK IN THEIR BOXES AFTER YOU USED THEM.
DUST AND MAGNETIC FIELDS ARE VERY DANGEROUS FOR YOUR TAPE.
DON'T TOUCH THE TAPE IT'S SELF AND DON'T LEAVE YOUR TAPEDECK ON PAUSE
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME( THE PLAYHEAD CAN DAMAGE RECORDINGS ON THE TAPE ).

***************************************************************************

Type: Metal ( high position )
Name:Sony Metal XR
Value for money 9+

Wow, this is what I call a good metal tape, it's cheap and is excellent for
CD recordings !
I have made the best recordings on this tape( most tapes i use are XR's).
There is a rumour that the sound will fade a little after about 5 years.

Very annoying is the fact that the tapewindow is to small and to dark to
watch trough( even in decks with light behind the window ) !!
The performance of the tape is bloody good, you can't hear the difference
between the tape and the CD on a good tapedeck !!!
The tape has a lot of dynamic and is very fresh in higher tones( depense
on the deck used).

***************************************************************************

Type: Metal ( high position )
Name: TDK MA-X
Value for money: 8

This is a good tape with good performances.
The window is bigger then the one from the XR, but the XR is better in
the recordings.
High tones seems to be sometimes a little too high.......
In the value for money department the Sony wins, coz' the TDK is a view
bucks expensiver.
One good thing is that the TDK will hold the recorded sound longer on a
high level then the Sony.
By the way the TDK MA( metal ) is a better buy and it is cheaper then the
MA-X and don't use them in your car( it will 'melt' at high temp.) !

So, the choice is to you !!

***************************************************************************

Also good tape's are,

Thats' MR-X Pro( expensive )
TDK SA CrO2 ( very good )
Goldstar MTX metal ( very good )
Basf CrO2 ( cheap and very good for the money )

***************************************************************************

That's it for this time, see ya next time with some new stuff on the HI-FI
section.
Remarks and ideas are always welcome, so write me a letter will ya !
