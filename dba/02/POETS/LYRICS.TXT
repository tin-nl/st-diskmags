        ARISE   

        Lyrics:Max

        OBSCURED BY THE SUN
        APOCALYPTIC CLASH
        CITIES FALL IN RUIN
        WHY MUST WE DIE?

        OBLITERATION OF MANKIND
        UNDER A PALE GREY SKY
        WE SHALL ARISE

        I DID NOTHING,SAW NOTHING
        TERRORIST CONFRONTATION
        WAITING FOR THE END
        WARTIME CONSPIRACY

        I SEE THE WORLD-OLD
        I SEE THE WORLD-DEAD

        VICTIMS OF WAR,SEEKING SOME SALVATION
        LAST WISH,FATALITY

        I`VE NO LAND,I`M FROM NOWHERE
        ASHES TO ASHES,DUST TO DUST

        FACE THE ENEMY
        MANIC THOUGHTS
        RELIGIOUS INTERVENTION
        PROBLEMS REMAIN



        DEAD EMBRYONIC CELLS

        Lyrics:Max

        LAND OF ANGER
        I DIDN'T ASK TO BE BORN
        SADNESS,SORROR
        EVERYTHING SO ALONE

        LABORATORY SICKNESS
        INFECTS HUMANITY
        NO HOPE FOR CURE
        DIE BY TECHNOLOGY

        A WORLD FULL OF SHIT COMING DOWN
        TRIBAL VIOLENCE EVERYWHERE
        LIFE IN THE AGE OF TERRORISM
        WE SPIT IN YOUR OTHER FACE

        WAR OF RACES
        WORLD WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE
        A PLACE CONSUMED BY TIME
        END OF IT ALL

        WE`RE BORN
        WITH PAIN
        NO MORE
        WE`RE DEAD
        EMBRYONIC CELLS

        CORROSION INSIDE-WE FEEL
        CONDEMNED FUTURE-WE SEE
        EMPTINESS CALLS-WE HEAR
        FINAL PREMONITION-THE TRUTH

        DESPERATE CRY
        Lyrics:Andreas

        SACRIFICE IS PLEASURE
        WHEN LIFE ENDS IN PAIN
        CONCEIVE THE LAST MISTAKE
        WHICH BELONGS TO ALL

        CREATION OF INSANE RULE
        ALL WE HEAR:
        DESPERATE CRY

        DEATH THE COLDEST WIND
        SEEPS INTO YOUR PORES
        A NATION BORN OF HATE
        FORGOTTEN DISTANT TIME

        ENDLESS EMPTY MAZE
        DESPAIR,DISTRESS AND SILENCE
        A POISON VACUUM,INFINITY
        LIFE,LIES,DECEIT

        MUTE SOULS END IN SILENCE
        OCEANS TAINTED WITH BLOOD
        EMPTY PROMISES OF HOPE
        BURIED DEEP,INFECTED GROUND

        CRY!!!!
 
 

        MURDER
        Lyrics:Max

        CHAOTIC VIOLENCE IN MY EYES
        THIS WHOLE WORLD MOVES BACKWARDS
        PEACE,ANOTHER SIGN THAT LIES
        LIFE TODAY IS NOT WORTH THE PAIN

        ON THE RADIO,ANOTHER HOMICIDE
        INMATES SUFFOCATE IN JAIL
        SEVERED HEADS OF REVOLT
        I WISH I`D NEVER BEEN BORN

        SAME HAND THAT BUILDS-DESTROYS
        SAME HAND THAT RELIEVES-BETRAYS
        SAME HAND THAT SEEDS-BURNS
        SAME HAND THAT EXISTS-HERE LIES

        I CAN`T TRUST ANYMORE
        CRIMINALS WITHIN THE LAW
        I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
        WHERE I LIVE,DON`T BELIEVE IN ANOTHER DAY

        HERESY AND GRAFT
        APARTHEID
        SAME RELIGION THAT SAVES-DAMNS YOU!
 



        SUBTRACTION
        Lyrics:Andreas

        FIRST GENERATION BORN
        A PLAQUE WAS GREATED
        THE CURE IS IN MY MIND
        SOLITUDE IS ALL I SEE

        POWERFUL NATIONS REPRESS FEELING
        BURIED BENEATH THE FEAR
        MAKING YOU A COWARD
        BUYING YOUR SAFETY

        GREY SHADOWS FILL YOUR HEAD
        STEALING YOUR LAST BREATH
        SCARED OF THE FUTURE
        PROPHECIES OF CHAOS

        SUBTRACTION OF PERSONALITY
        WITHIN THE HUMAN RACE
        YOU`LL ALWAYS BE

        GREEN CASTLES FROM THE PAST
        BLEEDING IN SANDS OF WAR
        NO MAN IS IMMORTAL
        HISTORY IS NO MORE

        CONFUSED LEADERS BEHIND OUR BACKS
        STIFLING OUR IDEAS
        MISUNDERSTAND SIGNS OF PROGRESS
        MINDS OF TIME REGRESS

        SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER
        TO UNDERSTAND MYSELF




        ALTERED STATE
        Lyrics:Andreas

        FEAR IN MY SUBCONSCIOUS
        TERROR INVADES MY SPEECH
        FAITH IN MY OWN WORDS
        NO ONE KNOWS THE NAMELESS

        WARM WINDS AND BURNING TEARS
        SPIRITS OUTSIDE THE BODIES

        ENDLESS REPRESSION BY MAJORITY
        A MASTER WITHOUT COMMAND
        STRANGE NEW DIMENSION DISTURBING MY BRAIN
        CENSORED IDEAS,COUNTERFEIT ANSWERS

        SHINING BLAST,NO PERCEPTION
        ALTERED STATE,NO REACTION
        SHINING BLAST
        ALTERED STATE

        SLOW TALK,FAST THOUGHTS
        ANCIENT SCRIPTURES
        CONTROVERCIAL LINES
        KNOWLEDGE CHANGES

        RUNNING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
        CROSSING WITH BLIND EYES
        I`M CLOSER TO MYSELF
        SANITY CAN`T INVADE




        UNDER SIEGE (REGNUM IRAE)
        Lyrics:Max

        THE DUAL SUBSTANCE OF CHRIST
        THE YEARNING SO HUMAN
        OF MAN TO ATTAIN GOD
        HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DEEP

        INSCRUTABLE MYSTERY TO ME
        MY PRINCIPLE ANGUISH AND SOURCE
        OF ALL MY JOYS AND SORROWS

        RELIGIOUS DOMAIN IS ALL I SEE
        SUFFOCATE THE SCUM WITH MEDIOCRITY
        LYING AND CHANGING YOUR FATE
        ANNO DOMINI ENDS-MISERY

        FROM MY YOUTH ONWARD
        HAS BEEN THE INCESSANT
        MERCILESS BATTLE BETWEEN
        THE SPIRIT AND THE FLESH
        AND MY SOUL IS THE ARENA
        WHERE THESE TWO ARMIES
        HAVE CLASHED AND MET

        HOLY WARS UNLEASHING BLOODY RAIDS
        THE SACRED EARTH WITHOUT A FACE
        CONSUMED BY MURDEROUS SINNERS
        PHYCHOTIC LEADER
        INSANE-INSANE-INSANE-INSANE

        LIVING IN A DYING AGE
        PERSECUTE THE HUMAN RACE
        TRIUMPH OF DEATH IN THE WASTELAND
        BLOOD SIGNS YOUR EPITAPH

        RELIGIOUS DOMAIN IS ALL I SEE
        SUFFOCATE THE SCUM WITH MEDIOCRITY
        LYING AND CHANGING YOUR FATE
        ANNO DOMINI ENDS-MISERY




        MEANINGLESS MOVEMENTS
        Lyrics:Andreas

        BORN WITH REMORSE
        TO A COLD BARREN PLACE
        BATTLE BETWEEN MINDS
        HUNGRY FOR WORDS OF PREY

        CONTRADICTORY TRUTH
        SECRETS IN LIES
        MEANINGLESS MOVEMENTS

        ICONS REVIEW THEIR SINS
        FAITH CHEAPER THAN THOU
        DOUBTING YOUR IDEALS
        TORMENT SHREDS YOUR BRAIN

        FEARFUL FANTASY RESPECTS THE UNKNOWN
        TURNING YOUR HEARTH RED
        A REQUIEM TO CELEBRATE...YOU

        WORDS I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND
        SHRIEKS IN MY MOMENT OF PAIN
        IMPOSTER HIDES BEHIND A MASK
        MY WORDS AGAINST YOUR LIES

        TURN MY HEAD
        TO SEE WHAT I KNOW
        A SHADOW WITHOUT FORM
        PAINTED ON THE WALL
        
        BORN WITH REMORSE
        TO A COLD BARREN PLACE
        BATTLE BETWEEN MINDS
        HUNGRY FOR WORDS OF PREY

        ONE MOMENT`S MISTAKE
        FALSE STEPS IN THE GROUD
        LAWS MADE BY THE BLIND
        RULING REIGN OF LIGHT

        CONTRADICTORY TRUTH
        SECRETS IN LIES
        MEANINGLESS MOVEMENTS

        
        

        INFECTED VOICE
        Lyrics:Andreas

        FEAR TIES YOU UP
        AND YOU DON`T GROW
        BEING WRONG AND LOST
        NO ONE ADMITS  THE DEFEAT

        CONSCIENCE IS FAIR
        UNFAITHFUL WORDS
        BETRAYAL AND GREED
        PAST THOUGHTS TO WIN ALONE

        ENVY-STILL STRONG
        HATRED-STILL ALIVE
        
        FROM BEYOND-AN EMPTY WORLD
        INFECTED VOICE-A SCREAM ALONE
        
        INFECTED VOICE!

        MY THROAT IS DRY
        A LAST CRY TRIES TO ESCAPE
        GUILT AND FRUSTRATION
        NO TIME TO RUN AROUND

        LOOKING BEHIND I`M NOT ALONE
        ARE THEY FRIENDS OR ENEMIES?
        GOING INSANE WITHOUT A CURE
        SCARRING MY EYES,VISIONS LOST

        REMORSE FOR THE HUMAN RACE
        FEAR OF BECOMING THEM
        ENVY THE STRONGEST FEELING
        HATRED STILL IN THEIR HEART

        ENVY-STILL STRONG
        HATRED-STILL ALIVE
       
        FROM BEYOND-AN EMPTY WORLD
        INFECTED VOICE-A SCREAM ALONE

        INFECTED VOICE!
