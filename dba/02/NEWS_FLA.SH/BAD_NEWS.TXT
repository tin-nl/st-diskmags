FUCK TO S.S.I.

JUST BAD PROGRAMMERS OR WHAT ???

Well for the ST freaks it seems that not all titles that are on the market
will be converted to the ST or even the STE. Especialy the firm S.S.I.
is one of those firms. Their new games as Pools of Darkness, Buck Rogers II
and Eye of the Beholder II ( this one looks really good on PC with VGA) 
won't be done for the ST. Well it isn't only a shame its bad to. When there
was only the normal ST i could have said okay maybe the ST isn't good enough
for it ( Lack of colors, hardware scrolling and sound ) but now with
the new STE on top of things they should and could have made a version
for these machines. OR..... is it just the fact they can programm on an
STE or what. Sorry guy's its just very very LAME to say it can't be done on
an Atari. Hope you choke in Amiga and PC...
