BEE FOROL DEMO.

The Bee Forol Demo.

Yess another demo is soon to be released and again its coming in from
France again. They really are busy these days. Okay the name of the new
demo is The Bee Forol demo. It is written in G.F.A. basic again, only
the music isn't. Special is that there also be 4 channel tracker music
included.

So now you might ask, who will make this new demo ???. Well its made
by  The Heavy Killers, an france alliance. This alliance contains of
several groups as there are: Forgotten Crew, T32, 1001 Crew, Spread
Master, Zap Creation and Sector One. I already have seen some of the
pre-view screens and i can tell you it looks very promesing indeed.
And as usual we made a guest screen for it so we will see you back 
then.

Sofar for the Bee Forol demo, special thanks to Jedi from the Sector
One crew for inside information and music's.
