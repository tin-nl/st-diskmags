                          ===================

* Toxic of Impact has also joined " Factory ". This is a new cracking
  group. They will probably make cd menu's too. Toxic is buying originals,
  swapping all the games, writing scrolltexts for the intro's, maybe
  creating cd menu's  and further everything else you can imagine.
  So, Toxic is a really busy guy!! Now he is in two big groups at the same
  time !! By the way Toxic also seems to make a diskmagazine.
 

* Dizzy Tunes ( ex Public enemy of Escape, now he is in Imagine or in Vagina
  as he used to call them before he joined ) is also making a diskmagazine.
  ( We are looking forward to the first issue, so send it to us as soon as 
  possible ! )     Success !!

* F.L.C. in Holland has made there first intro. The coding was done by
  Fix and the grafix by Digital Coolness. This intro was released on the D.B.A.
  ST Party on 14 december.  Success with more productions guys !!
