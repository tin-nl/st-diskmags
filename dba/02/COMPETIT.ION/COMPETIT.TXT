                ===============================


 Hello, this is Ecto 1 with the competition corner. Unfortunately there was 
 not that much response on our puzzle of magazine 1. There where only a few 
 people who sent me there solution ( thanks guys ), but that is too less to
 give someone a price. So this time i have not made a new puzzle, because 
 it has cost me a lot of time to make a puzzle for our previous magazine.
 I don't do it for that less response!! So come on guys, make the puzzle 
 (the same as before), and send your solution to us. You can win an original 
 game and a music-tape with some tunes of Nintendo games. ( Thanks to FAA 
 of N.P.G. for making this prizes available) Here are the instructions one
 more time:

 Try to solve this puzzle ( find the words ). Print this page out, and 
 erase the words you found with a pencil. If you have found all words, 
 there is a special note for you. (the letters which are not used).

 Send the solution to the P.O.Box of the DBA HQ in Holland. (for bad
 reminders :  P.O.Box 506  9200 AM  DRACHTEN  The Netherlands ). 
 We have a nice prize for the winner, so send your solution to us as
 soon as possible. The winner will be mentioned in our next magazine.

 Good luck !!
