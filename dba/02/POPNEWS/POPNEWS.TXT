The 45-years old singer of Queen, Freddy Mercury, who said the day before he
died that he suffered from AIDS, has died on sunday 24 november. He was
living in a big house in Kensington in London. Especially the last weeks,
there were big rumours that Freddy should suffer AIDS, but he still denied.
He said: I have waited so long to say i have AIDS to protect the privacy of
the people around me. He had summon all his fans all over the world to 
join the organisation against AIDS.

Freddy Mercury was born as " Frederick Bulsara " in 1946 in Zanzibar. He
grew up in Bombay. When he was 13 years old, his family returned to
England. There he went to the art-academy. 

In 1968 three of Freddy's fellow-students, (Roger Taylor, Brian May and 
Tim Staffel), founded a group called " Smile ". They released a single,
but that was a failure. One year later Staffel was replaced by Mercury.
He changed the name of the group in " Queen " immediately. One year later
John Deacon joined them too. Twenty years later Queen is one of the best
groups in the world. His first (famous) album was "Queen" of '73. A year
later there came "Queen II". Their first hit was "Killer Queen" in 
december 1974. After that one there came the following hits: "Somebody
to love", "We are the champions", "Crazy little thing called love", 
"Under pressure", "Radio GaGa " and a lot more. Queen also joined the
Live Aid Concert in 1985. There are sold over 100 million records of the 
group Queen. At the moment they have a big hit with " The show must go on ".
Unfortunately not for Freddy Mercury...........

Freddy never made a secret of his bi-sexuality and his adventurious
life-style.
