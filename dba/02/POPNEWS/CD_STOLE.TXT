M.JACKSON CD ROBBERY

MICHAEL JACKSON ROB ??,

Well not exactly Michael himself but 30.000 LP's and CD's
are robbed. Three armed man have stolen the 30.000 LP's and CD's
from a depot in Los Angeles. The recordings in questions stand 
for a value of 400.000 Amerikan dollars (around 800.000 Guilders).
The new album "Dangerous" was just released as you might know.
Earlier this month the was a lot of critic on Michaels latest video
clip "Black Or White". Esspecialy in the good old U.S.A. The people
there didn't like it at all seeing Michael breaking carwindows, trash
can trowing trought windows and grabbed his own balls !!! ( They should
be glad he didn't grabbed the ones that complained.). But not that 
alone ,noooo, he even opened his gulp...
Well since then there is a lot cutting in his new clip, and they left
the good parts. I can tell you there isn't much left but oke....
