Hello guys of D.B.A.

I have bought a new game called " Thunderhawk ". It is a nice game, but
the problem is that it is French! Do you know if there is an English
version of this game? According to the shop-assistant of a computershop
in Groningen there isn't, but i haven't read in magazines that there
isn't an English version. Otherwise they should inform their readers
about this i think.           ( Richard G. )                

Answer:

You are a very lucky guy! There is an English version available of this
game " Thunderhawk ". We do have it in our PD software, but in that
version you don't have sampled voices in the intro. If there is a demo-
version than there is also a full working version, so go to another 
computershop and buy it there. I hope you can get your money back or
can choose another game at the shop you bought the French version!

Hello Bonus,

In your previous magazine i have read that there will come a version 4
of GFA Basic. Do you have some more details about it yet? I am very
interested in it!                              (JEFF)

Answer: 

Ecto 1 saw an advertisment in an ST magazine about GFA 4. Because that
was very interesting to know for all ST freaks, he put this news in
magazine 1. But we don't know when it will be ready and available. So
Ecto 1 has written a letter to the publisher of GFA, in which he asked
for some more details. When we know more we will inform you immediately !

Yo  Ecto !  (or another member of D.B.A. )

Sometime ago i have played the game " Street Smart " on a megadrive of a
friend of mine. It is a really great game. Do you know if there is or will 
come an Atari ST(E) version of it? I hope so !!          ( Geert P. )

Answer: 

At the moment " Ocean " is trying to get the copyrights of this game. So
the ST version of this game is not ready at the moment. And if it is ready,
i don't know whether it is working on an STE or not. If we have the game
available for a review, than we will also inform you about this.

Hello guys,

I just have bought an Atari 1040ST(fm). Before this computer i had a Commodore
64. So a big improvement don't you think? Because i had coded some intro's
on the C-64 too, i will also make a demo on the ST. Because i don't have
experience on the ST i don't know which kind of basic should i use for
this? There are so many basics on the ST !! I have GFA basic, Omnikron
basic and STOS basic, but i know there are even more.     ( Gerrit H. )

Answer:

I think the easiest basic is STOS. I don't know which version of STOS you
have, but the latest is 2.6 ( We do have a PD version of it, so you can 
first give it a try and afterthat choose if you want to buy the original 
full version of it. ) There was also a STOS beginners corner in DBA magazine
1. In this magazine there is an article for people with some more experience
with STOS, but in the next issue there will be a STOS beginners article again.
STOS is meant for creating games, but it is a full basic and you can make
nice demo's if you want. ( look at " The big STOS demo", the " S-Extension
demo ", the " Cor Blimey megademo " or some other STOS demo's we have in
our PD library. Good luck and send me your demo's if they are ready!
