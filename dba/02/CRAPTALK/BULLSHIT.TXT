JUST A DAY

                        JUST A DAY OUT OF MY LIFE,

7.00 I'm sleeping, dreaming about money, women and beer.
     Then suddenly: bbbzzzzz !!!! smack !!! The parts of a clockradio
     are flying trough the sleepingroom.

7.05 Bang, i hit the lightbutton and three 60 watts lightbulbs, light up
     in the dark room. I'm blinded and try to let my eyes get used to
     the light. aaarrggghhh it's another working day.

7.15 I go to the bathroom and i slam with my head against the door....
     Bump !! aaauuuwww. f..k , sh.t !! 

7.20 Aaah... warm water, the shower is hot and i begin to feel alive now.
     ssshhhiiiittt, I've run out of hot water. Just on the moment that
     i have my hair and my body are sucking in sope !!
     ( this actual happend ).

7.35 Time to make some sandwiches to take with me to my work !
     After i cut myself four times, the sandwiches are ready.

7.45 Before I go to my work, i always listen to some music( really ).
     Guns N' Roses are playing now and i forget all the things that
     happened to me this morning( and also the time ).

8.05 Oh no !! I'm too late for my work. I rush downstairs......
     Shit, forgot my sandwiches so i must go upstairs again !!

8.10 I rush on my bicycle trough the streets to my work.
     Boy, will my boss be angry.....

8.15 Finally i made it, what the f..k is this, there is nobody here !
     Is this some kind of joke, or......

8.17 I look at my watch and i see that it is sunday today !!
     Something goes: pssssss....and i've got a flat tire.

8.30 Screaming and crying i arrive at my mommy's home.
     She gives me a cup of coffee.
     I ask her if i can move back in again, but she yells in panic: noooo.

9.00 My dear mommy throws me out of her house and for the second time
     i walk trough the streets with my bicycle. 
     Is there nobody on this planet that gives a shit( or some money ) ?!
     Even my girl left me sometime ago, it's time for me make an end
     on my miserable life !

9.10 Sh.t, this bridge is high !! I don't have the balls to jump down.
     I'm afraid of hights !!!!!
     Lets go home.

9.20 Why don't I write all this shit in the D.B.A. magazine.
     So, here i am typing all the things that happened to me this morning.

***************************************************************************

Maybe there is a second part of this day, but i have to wait till it is
over.
Lets hope that i will survive this day to tell you how it ended !
Till next time.........
