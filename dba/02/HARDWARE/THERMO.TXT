THERMO FAN.

THERMO FAN OR HOW TO SILENCE YOUR HARDDISK.

We have seen it work on a stand at the H.C.C. show, and it looks really
good. Now i am talking about the Thermo-Fan. It seems to be the first
to get in the Netherlands, i don't know about the rest of the world.
So what is it then ????

Well is a fan with a small build in temperature adjustment, so it
turn it self off if the harddisk is cold enough an turns on if it's
getting to warm. Or just blow less air is the temperature stays steady.
Well what more is so special about it ????
- It can be used instead of anyother fan in the ST / harddisk
- You can install it in less then 5 minutes
- You don't need any extra parts
- You can install it without any soldering.
- Every piece of electronic is build in.
- Absolute no noise trough "State of the Art" bearings
- Industrial quality
- Doesn't use much energy
- Available in many different sizes.
- Also available in 24 volt.
