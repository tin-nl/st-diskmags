Let's do it again.......( ooohh yeeaahhh )
Lets go trough the second part of this CD shit.

***************************************************************************

Titel       : On Every Street
Group/artist: Dire Straits

Dire Straits is back on the track with their new album: On Every Street.
This CD has reached in no time the charts and landed, here in the Nether-
lands on the first place.
A number one position is not so amazing, coz' Dire Straits is one of the most
popular bands ever.

On this CD is the hit: Calling Elvis, a average song( I think ) for a group
like Dire Straits.
The CD has some nice songs on it, but i think that this CD is not the best
they have ever made( where are those famous classical masterpieces ??).
I still like the old Dire Straits when they where making albums like:
Making Movies and Telegraph Road.


Music Value: 8+                         Recording Quality: 9-

Title       : Muzikale Miniaturen 8
Group/artist: Many different Orchestra's

This CD contains a lot of classical songs performed by big orchestra's like:
the Philadelphia Orchestra, Academy of St.Martin-in-the-fields and others.
They play famous pieces from: Ravel, Mozart, Rodrigo and two other famous
composers.

This is a CD from EMI to promote the Classical music a bit, there is a whole
serie with Muzikale Miniaturen.
On this CD are the: Bolero( very nice, remember Bo Derek ?), Concierto de
Aranjuez, Die Schlittenfarth and a view more.

I personaly like this CD, i'm not a big expert on Classical music but i'm
a guy who don't stick to one kind of music all the time.
Every sort of music has its charm !!

Music Value: 9+                          Recording Quality: 9-

Title       : Past to the Present 1977-1990  
Group/artist: Toto

Finally all the big hits of Toto on one CD.
The CD contains 13 songs of average recording quality, logical coz' some of
the recordings are a couple of years old.

On the CD are hits like: Africa, Hold the Line, Rosanna, Stop Loving you,
Pamela and a view lesser know songs.
My personal favorites are: Hold the Line, Out of Love, Stop Loving you.
Go to your CD-Shop and buy this marvelous CD.

Music Value: 8+                         Recording Quality: 8-

Title       : A Kind of Magic
Group/artist: Queen

On this Queen CD are some soundtracks from famous movies.
The songs: One Vision comes from the movie, Iron Eagle 1 and Who wants to
Live Forever comes from the movie, Highlander 1.
There are some more songs from Highlander 1 on this CD for the fans.
On this CD are also the hits: A Kind of Magic and Friends will be Friends.

The CD contains 12 songs that are all DDD recordings.
It's a little disappointing to know that the recording quality is not so
good as you might expect for a DDD CD.
It's a fact that sometimes good recorded AAD CD's sound better then DDD CD's ! 
The AAD CD's dont have that specific digital sound that makes the music
sometimes sound a little hard !
This even counts for very expensive CD players and digital amplifiers.

The three last songs on the CD are remixes of three songs on the same CD.
I think that these remixes sound a bit better in quality then the rest of
the tracks on this Queen CD.

A couple of days after i typed this review of the Queen CD, the leadsinger
of Queen died.
Freddy Mercury has become 45 years old and died trough AIDS........R.I.P.

Music: 8                                Recording Quality: 8

Title       : Collection Gold
Group/artist: Santana

On the time of writing i was listening to a CD of Santana that i've just
bought called: Collection Gold.
Santana makes music with a South American rhythm, using a lot of percussions 
, drums and guitars.
When i listen to this kind of music, i get a tropical feeling all over me.
A white beach, longdrinks, lots of lovely women and blue skies( oh wow ).
Sigh, but i've got only the CD and that must do for a while.

The CD contains 13 tracks including the hit She's Not There and a lot of
songs i don't know very well( i will get used to them real soon ).
I think it's great music, but that's for yourself to decide if you like it
or not.
Carlos Satana is also a excellent guitar player, he belongs in the same
category as: Eric Clapton for instance.
A great CD with great tunes, drop the hiphop and buy yourself some decent
music will ya'.

Music: 9-                               Recording Quality: 7+
