OLD SCROLLINES


                            Hi' People,

First a little explanation about the shit that is written below here.
In the summervaction of '91 we had our Swedish member Mr.Cool on a visit.
We where all together on the D.B.A. meeting, and on this meeting some
scrolltext's where written for our Just Fun Demo part 2.
These scrolltext's are now old, but it's still very funny to read.
The night before the meeting we had almost no sleep, coz' we where hangin'
around in a disco.
So, most of the members had hangover's and a lack of sleep !!
This is the result, i have left everything original( with spelling mistakes ),
so you can have fun reading a lot of pure bullshit.

screen trying to write some crappy stuff !! the whole D.B.A. crew is at
the D.B.A. party(we've got lots of new ideas, so watch out for some new
D.B.A. stuff).....currently Bonus and K.G.E. are working on some demoscreens

 Well so now it's my turn, guess who ?????.. Bonus of course, one of the lazy
 coders from the D.B.A., so what can I tell you, we are now writing a copy 
program for the b part of the just fun demo. It will be a special diskcopier
but you will see it we it is ready. There will be more nice demo's with lot's
of scroll text in them to read. I hope i can finisch it all in time, but i got 
no time for coding left. My car seems to have a new hobby called break down.
It's seems it stop at every corner of every street nowadays. So i have to fix
it almost every time, and the there is my new job. I make twice as much hours
as every one else, so not much time left to do whatever... But Part B i hope
to release it end of August so see you then.....
HOI the text from  KGE is hidden you know... Press Alternate 20 times to see 
my lines....                                                  Just kidding 
(it was a combination of twenty keys, so get your knees up the keyboard to 
press CTRL+SHIFT+ALTERNATE+F1 to F10 and then hit te RESET button with your 
nose. If this all didn't work, just keep on practicing... Well good luck, 
and hold your breath for the next demo. there you have to use a second person 
to hit all the keys... Keep up the good (and bad) work.... Bye.......
