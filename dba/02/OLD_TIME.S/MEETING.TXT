            D.B.A. Meeting held on sunday 06-07-'91

For the first time in the history of D.B.A. we had a meeting where every
member was present !
The member status on that moment was,

Slimer(me)       Vigo
Bonus            K.G.E.
Mr.Cool          Fat Jack( who wasn't a member at that time)
Ecto 1           Mr.Yoga( supporting )

Our member from Sweden Mr.Cool was here for his holiday.
The one big thing I remember about that day was : IT WAS HOT !!
Well, we had bought lots a bottles of coke and crisps, so we managed to
survive te whole thing !
It was on this party when all the good idea's came around like: this
magazine and some other stuff.
Mr.Cool was working on a very long scrolltext for our second demo !
Vigo was copying lots of demo's and other stuff.
Bonus and K.G.E. where very bussy with a copy program for the second demo.
Fat Jack was playing some crazy game( selling pencils or so) !
Slimer( me ) was watching a tape from the ST News party.
Mr.Yoga was cruising between all the guys !

This all was in the beginning of our party, but what happend at the end ?
Mr.Cool was asleep on the couch.......
Vigo was still copying( as always ).
Bonus was copying to because he couldn't solve the bug in the program.
K.G.E. also couldn't get the program working, so he was screaming and shouting.
Fat Jack was bankrupt.
Slimer, well I was still looking at the tape( very funny, those weird people).
Mr.Yoga was trying to calm K.G.E. !

This was a very strange party, but it was fun.
We came up with the magazine idea, so it was useful after all !
You see the result of that meeting here on your screen.
Did you noticed that every magazine looks the same, they all use pulldown
menu's and they all have the same shitty text-displayers.
Most of the text-displayer are slow and full of bugs like you want to see
one page not all the page's( ring a bell ) !!
So, we decided to do it better, so we did(I hope)  !

You can read more about the party in the D.B.A. Just Fun Demo 2.
This was Slimer saying: Keep Cool Fuck an Icebear !
