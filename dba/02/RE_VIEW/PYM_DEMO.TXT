                *******************************************

          THE PUNISH YOUR MACHINE DEMO BY DELTA FORCE AND FRIENDS,

                *******************************************

Some time ago we recieved a demo from Delta Force, called the PYM Demo.
We waited for quite a while to see this demo and finally we recieved
the first disk of this two disk party mega-demo( disk two was broke ).
I almost raped my computer to see if this really is a better demo then the
Syntax Terror demo.
So, lets begin with review of the first disk,

***************************************************************************

The Loader,

Some big distorted words are going over your screen saying: Punish Your
Machine.
Then there are screens with text, poping up with the member status on it.
Nice screen, nothing really special here........

***************************************************************************

Loading screens,

There are loadingscreens with the credits on it, these screens will show up
everytime you load a demoscreen.
The screen will turn orange when the unpacking is done, and then you can
hit the spacebar to see the demo.

***************************************************************************

The Main Menu,

A lot of colors are floating around in the background, you can choose demo's
by selecting a screen, these screens will scroll up or down when you use the
arrowkeys.
In the background are the greetings scrolling over the screen( from below
to the top of the screen).
Nice.........

***************************************************************************

Sickest so far,

The first demoscreen in this demo from the Delta Force( coded by Big Alec).
In the top of the screen is a Delta Force logo on a tube, it gives you the
idea that the logo is floating round the tube.
In this screen are also a lot of scrollines and a lot of dots that jump
towards you.
Very good screen.......

***************************************************************************

Coast by BMT,

A screen made by the BMT, they call it the Cray II Emulator on a ST.
First there is a info. screen with a one plane background flying around.
Then you get to see the fractals, there is a clock that shows how fast the
ST is doing his calculations to make a fractal on screen.
There is a small scrolltext and a clock, the lower border is gone.
Very Nice screen.......

***************************************************************************

Copper-Kaah-Baah-Naah by Delta Force,

Delta Force really seem to like colors, coz' they made so many colorshock
demo's that i completly lost count.
There is a distorted logo of Delta Force in the lower border.
The colors are in the background and there is also an text scrolling up.
In this screen is also a big scrolline with a stunning font( real cool).
Shocking.......

***************************************************************************

ISHIDO( game of the stones ) by CY

I have not played the game yet, but is sure looks cool to me !
The Delta Force seem also to like games with stones in them, strange people
those Germans !
Stone crazy......

***************************************************************************

When the colors are going bang bang by Delta Force,

The upper half of the screen contains of a horizontal starfield and a the
Delta Force logo drawn by Tanis of T.C.B.( just great ) !!
There is also a scrolline made of colors, transforming in different shapes
and using a lot of effects.
In the lower part of this screen is a normal scrolline with the usual crap
talk.
By the way press the * and see a member of the Delta Force appear.
Is this the female member ?? Or............??
All in all a very cool screen !!

***************************************************************************

Lief Rullar by Electra,

This is a demo in the demo, coz' the part of Electra seem to include 5 screens.#
It all starts with a presentation screen with a piccy and a short sample.

Screen 1.

It starts with a globe made of dots and there are a view other objects also
made out of dots, passing by on your screen.

Screen 2.

All sorts of lines made of dots, forming different shapes( you can press the
function keys F1 till F5 to see them all ).

Screen 3.

3D objects made out of balls and greetings are send to some people.

Screen 4.

A ball made out of 964 dots, looks cool.

Screen 5.

The last screen of the Electra demo.
On this screen is a starfield containing 1720 dots, very nice.

Great contribution to the Punish your Machine Demo, nice coded.

***************************************************************************

There are many sheeps in outer China by Overlanders

This is also a demo containing 3 different sorts of screens.
It all begin with a piccy of the winter Olympics.
Then there appears a screen with no left and right border and with only
small window to look trough.
In this window there are words circling around made of vector graphics.

In the second stage of the demo there is a object made of vector graphics
functioning like a level indicator.
In the lowerborder are many different logo's appearing and disappearing of
the Overlanders.
There is also a normal scrolline if i'm correct.
This screen will be sometime's interupted by some info. screens with balls
droping down from the top of the screen.
After that a new vector object will appear on the screen !

In the third stage there is a fullscreen with module sound.
Text is appearing on the screen scrolling up from the lower part of the
screen with greetings.
There are also level indicators in this screen.
Good stuff.......

***************************************************************************

The reset demo by T.L.B. and Delta Force,

There is a info. screen first saying that the Starfield record of Electra
is beaten.
After that a lot of dots come towards you( 8200 Dots ) a part of the dots
have formed the names, Delta Force and T.L.B. !
Then these name's will fall apart in a lot of dots, this while playing module
music.
Very good stuff.....

***************************************************************************

There are many more screens in this demo, but i havent recieved the B disk
yet of this mega-demo.
Maybe i recieve the second part before we release this magazine, then i will
review the second part seperatly in this submenu.
The Punish your Machine demo is one of the best party-demo's around for
what i have seen till now......
I won't give points, but Delta Force your high in my charts !!
Get your copy soon and you will see what i mean !
