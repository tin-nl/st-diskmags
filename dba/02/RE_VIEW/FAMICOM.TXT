SUPER GHOULS'N GHOSTS (CAPCOM) 8-MBIT JUMP'N RUN APPEARING 10/91  1PLAYER

I THINK YOU KNOW THE STORY OF GHOULS'N GHOSTS!THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST
JUMP AND RUN'S I EVER PLAYED ON A CONSOLE.THE GRAPHICS OF THIS GAME ARE A 
MASTERPIECE.SOMETIMES IF ON THE SCREEN TOO MUCH OBJECTS THE PROCESSOR WILL A
LITTLE BIT SLOW DOWN BUT IT DISTURBS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE GAMEFUN.

SUPER TENNIS (TONKIN HOUSE) 4-MBIT SPORT APPEARING 11/91 1/2 PLAYER 

NOW THE FAMICOM HAS THE FIRST TENNIS GAME,IT WAS DONE BY TONKIN HOUSE THE MAKERS
OF FINAL MATCH TENNIS ON THE PC ENGINE(THE BEST TENNIS GAME EVER).NOW WE HOPE 
THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD WORK FOR THIS MACHINE.WHEN YOU START THE MODULE YOU WILL 
SEE A INTRO THAT USES THE 3-D CHIP.YOU CAN CHOOSE BETWEEN SINGLE GAME 1P VS.
COMP. OR 2P.DOUBLE 1P+2P VS.COMP OR 1P+COMP. VS. 2P+COMP. OR CHAMPIONSHIP.
IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP YOU MUST PLAY AGAINST LENDL,EDBERG...SELES,GRAF...
THE GAME LOOKS NICE,IT HAS SOME PORTRAITS FROM THE TOP 10 PLAYERS(MALE,FEMALE).
WHEN YOU PLAYING THE CHAMPIONSHIP YOU CAN CATCH POINTS FOR EVERY MATCHWIN.IF 
YOU HAVE WON SOME OPENS OR MATCHES YOU WILL BECOME TO A MEMBER OF THE CLUB OF
THE TOP 5.A NICE IDEA IS THAT WHEN YOU MAKE A GOOD OR NOT SO GOOD BALLCHANGE
THE PLAYERS WILL HAVE SOME EMOTIONS. ALL IN ALL IT IS A VERY GOOD GAME BUT NOT
SO GOOD AS THE PC ENGINE VERSION FROM THE SAME SOFTWAREHOUSE.
OH I FORGOT SOMETHING,ALL TEXTS OF THIS GAME ARE NOT IN JAPAN THEY ARE IN 
ENGLISH.AND THATS GOOD FOR LOOK IN SOME STATISTICS.

PRO SOCCER (IMAGENIEER) 4-MBIT SPORT APPEARING 10/91 1/2 PLAYER

THIS IS THE CONVERSION OF THE WELL KNOWN GAME ON THE ST KICK OFF.BUT THIS
GAME 1:1 CONVERTED FROM THE COMPUTER WITH A LITTLE BETTER GRAPHICS.AND THAT
IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THE CAPABILITY OF THE FAMICOM. ALL I CAN SAY IS DONT BUY IT
THIS IS REAL SHIT.

SUPER R-TYPE (IREM) 6-MBIT SHOOT'EM UP APPEARING 9/91 1 PLAYER

SUPER R-TYPE IS A GAME FOR FREAKS I AM ARE.THE GAME IS VERY GOOD IN GRAPHICS 
AND HAS A FABOULOUS SOUND BUT IT SLOW DOWNS SOMETIMES (THATS GOOD FOR SOME 
LEVELS SO YOU CAN DO IT EASYER),BUT IT HAS A GREAT ERROR.WHEN YOUR SHIP IS 
DESTROYED AT EVERY PLACE IN THE LEVEL,EXCEPT THE ENDMONSTER,YOU MUST START
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS LEVEL.BUT I THINK THE FABOULOUS GRAPHICS AND A 
SOUND YOU NEVER HAVE HEARD BEFORE WOULD DELETE THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS.
ALL IN ALL A GOOD SHOOT'EM UP THAT IS BETTEN THAN DARIUS TWIN.

MYSTICAL NINJA OR GEOMON(KONAMI)ACTION ADVENTURE 8-MBIT APPEARING 9/91 1/2 PLAYER

ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS IS THE BEST ACTION ADVENTURE AT THIS MOMENT.IT HAS
VERY SMOOTHLY SCROOLING GGOD SOUND AND GRAPHICS,IT HAS LOT OF SHOPS YOU CAN BUY
EXTRAS AND A LOT MORE.

ACTRAISER (ENIX) ACTION-ADV.+STRATEGY 8-MBIT APPEARING 9/91 1 PLAYER

IF YOU LOVE GAMES LIKE BARBARIAN AND POPULOUS,NOW YOU HAVE ALL IN ONE.
THIS GAME SHOWS YOU TO WHAT THE FAMICOM CAPABLE IS.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU ARE ON A FLYING TEMPLE,WITH IT YOU CAN
ARRIVE THE VARIOUS CONTINENTS.YOU MUST FIRST START A ACTIONLEVEL.IN THIS
LEVEL YOU CONTROL A KNIGHT.HE CAN JUMP,RUN,DUCK AND FIGHT WITH HIS SWORD.
IN A TIMELIMIT YOU MUST FIGHT TO THE END OF THE LEVEL.IF YOU HAVE DESTROYED 
THE ENDMONSTER ((OBERMOTZ) AS WE SAY IN GERMAN) IT GOES ON IN A POPOULOUS LIKE
COLONIZE LEVEL.HERE YOU SEE THE AREA FROM THE BIRD LIKE PERSPECTIVE.NOW YOU CAN
CONTROL A LITTLE ANGEL.YOUR POPULATION STARTS WITH AN ADAM+EVA COUPLE THAT ARE
IN A TEMPLE AND WAITING TILL YOU HAVE BUILD SOME STREETS.YOU HAVE A MENULEDGE
IN THAT YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS (ONLY I FYOU HABVE ENOUGH POINTS) LIKE 
BUILDING STREETS,FIRING LIGHTNINGS,MAKE RAIN,EARTQUAKES,WIND (FOR THE WINDMILLS)
AN A LOT MORE.WHEN YOU HAVE BUILD ENOUGH STREETS AND THE PEOPLE WILL COLONIZE
ALL THE LAND BESIDES THE STREETS,AND YOU KILLED ALL LITTLE MONSTERS THEY WILL 
KILLING YOUR PEOPLE,DESTROYING THEIR HOUSES AND FIELDS,YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT
ACTION LEVEL.AND SO ON.
IF YOU WANT ONLY TO PLAY THE ACTION LEVELS THEN YOU MUST PRESS THREE TIMES THE
SELECT BUTTON.

ALL IN ALL.WHEN YOU HAVE PLAYED SOME LEVELS YOU WILL SEE LEVELS WITH GRAPHICS
THAT ARE SO FABOULOUS YOU WONT BELIEVE YOUR EYES,AND YOU CAN HEAR MUSICS YOU
NEVER HEARD BEFORE, IT SOUNDS LIKE A ORCHESTRA PLAYING IN YOU ROOM.
