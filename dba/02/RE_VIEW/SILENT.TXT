SILENT SERVICE II

SILENT SERVICE II,

After a very long conversion time of 1 1/2 year is is finally there
the new sub marine simulation. And there is already one very bad
thing to say, you almost should buy yourself a harddisk to play this
game proper. And even then the loading times a very long, not to say
to long. Further there isn't much changed. The graphix still look 
very good, but the real sub mariane feeling only is there is you
have a good sound turned on. They who loved the first version well
they know what to do, the rest i would say go out and buy it if this
is your type of game cause its good.

                                        Bonus Sofware.
