 Enter "ALF" in the hiscore table for infinite energy.

- Y ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Unfortunately,  no  software  company got the bright idea to  release  a  game 
starting with the fabled letter "Y". Off the top of my head I can only think of 
one title that starts with a "Y",  and that's "Your Second Manual to the  Atari 
ST" (which is no game).
 What a shame.

 BMX RACER: Try a super jump by pressing both A and B as your front wheel takes

 SURFING:  For a surprise,  try this: Lose two of your lives, then just stay on 
your board,  wait for the time to run down to about three,  and steer  yourself
