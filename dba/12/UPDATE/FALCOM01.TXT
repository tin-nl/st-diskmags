FALCON COMPATIBILITY LIST 1
~DUST.FIL~
                         THE FALCON COMPATIBILITY LIST
                               MK. IV AND A HALF
                             by Richard Karsmakers
                  (after an old idea by Cottonwood Computers)

 For those of you still waiting to purchase a Falcon, I have compiled a list of 
some stuff that has been tested on it (not just by me,  mind you). This list is 
based on some original research and the idea of Cottonwood Computers,  which is 
a  USA  Atari retailer.  I have used only a small part  of  their  list,  which 
originally  contained a lot of programs I guess nobody has ever heard  of,  and 
have  afterwards added a lot of stuff myself (from other sources as well as  my 
own experience).
 Please  realize  that  some  of the programs  featured  here  have  been  used 
extensively  whereas  some  others,   obviously,  haven't.  I  can't  take  any 
responsibility  for  the accuracy of the data featured  here.  Of  course,  you 
should  also  take into consideration that what is tested for  here  is  Falcon 
compatibility,  not  "MultiTOS" compatibility!  If "MultiTOS" compatibility  is 
known, this will be indicated.
 I  would like to send thanks to some of the people whose research I have  also 
used:  Piper,  Kai Holst, Gregg, Sean Dougherty, Cut FlÅgel, David Fairweather, 
Silicon Magic,  Bob DeWitt,  John Stansford, Paul Glover, the Atari Falcon Club 
and  John  Eidsvoog.  Special thanks to Heiko Hartmann (who runs  an  extensive 
compatibility list on internet,  including flag settings for  "Backward",  most 
excellent!).
 Last  but  not least I'd like to mention that most of the  stuff  I've  tested 
myself was done on a 4 Mb TOS 4.04 Falcon,  with Sinister Developments' "FBoot" 
version 1.2 and "Backward" version 2.72 handy.
 After each section, a success ratio is given: RUNS/TOTAL.
