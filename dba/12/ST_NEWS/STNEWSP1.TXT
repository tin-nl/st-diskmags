                        SOME SHORT INFO ABOUT "ST NEWS"
       (Also including the latest definitive ST NEWS compatibility list)
                             by Richard Karsmakers


  ST  NEWS is a non-commercial disk magazine written for and written  by  Atari 
ST/TT/Falcon  computer enthusiasts.  It is published at irregular intervals  by 
the Amazing Cracking Conspiracy (of the world's most virtual group ever to roam 
the scene, Quartermass Experiment), and spread through the Public Domain.

 ST NEWS has an international network of around a dozen official  international 
distributors  as  well as some sortof unofficial ones (such  as  Floppyshop  in 
Scotland,  ACN  in  the Netherlands,  and there are some  more).  The  official 
distributors have their addresses listed at the end of this article.  These are 
the  addresses to write to when you want to get your hands on any of  the  back 
issues you might desire.
 Please  note that the official foreign distributors generally require  an  SAE 
and a disk to send issues to you in.  If you live in another country than them, 
please supply sufficient International Reply Coupons - NO stamps!
 If in doubt,  you can always order ST NEWS issues by sending SAE + IRCs to the 
ST NEWS correspondence address.  A donation now and again,  of course, would be 
really welcome.

 If you want to get in touch with more ST NEWS, you can have a look at the list 
of back-issues below.  Only to die-hard ST NEWS fans may it be advisable to get 
any of the pre-Undead issues (i.e.  the ones before the Final Compendium).  The 
later issues are definitely more worth while.
