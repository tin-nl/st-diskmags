                "HELLO" - SOME BACKGROUND INFO ABOUT "ST NEWS"
                             by Richard Karsmakers


 ST  NEWS  was started in July 1986 and has been going  strong  ever  since.  A 
couple  of  years  ago  we got in contact with the  guys  from  "DBA  Magazine" 
resulting in a variety of small assistances and contributions,  as well as this 
rather much larger contribution.
 I am Richard Karsmakers,  born November 3rd 1967,  and I am the driving  force 
behind ST NEWS. I have been editor for most of its existence with the exception 
of a few years when other activities (studies, work) forced me to mellow down a 
bit and the editorial sceptre was taken over by Stefan "Digital Insanity of the 
Lost Boys" Posthuma.  Next year,  in July, the magazine will celebrate its 10th 
birthday and I am thinking of organising a rather memorable event to  fittingly 
end  this decade of freaking out.  At that time I should also have finished  my 
studies  (I am a student of English at Utrecht University),  so it should be  a 
memorable event in any case - at least for me <grin>.
 Anyway, I am straying a bit.

 In this submenu (well, I asked them to put all this stuff in a submenu anyway, 
so  I hope they've done that!) you will find a cross section of ST NEWS  stuff, 
most of it really recent.  There's some fiction,  some reference material  and, 
indeed, some more information about ST NEWS itself and the other things I do. I 
have  deliberately  refrained from including computer-related reviews  and  the 
like,  because A) I trust the people at DBA have written sufficiently to  cover 
that  particulra area,  and B) Otherwise there would be no need to get ST  NEWS 
anymore.
 I hope you'll enjoy it, and please don't refrain from getting the odd issue of 
ST NEWS yourself should the writings have manifested such a need in you.

 The  next  issue of ST NEWS,  to be released in May or June (most  likely  the 
latter) 1995 - Volume 10 Issue 1 - should contain some of the following...

===============================================================================
 AN INTERVIEW WITH MR. JEFF "NAKED FACE" MINTER!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Jeff  Minter is,   without a hint at the shadow of the merest  figment  of  a 
doubt,   just   perhaps  probably conceivably the most influential  human alive 
in  the world  of home computing today,    maybe (at least to us he is).  With 
his  fabulously  playable  shareware games he has revived  the  sleeping   non-
commercial   scene,    and  with his opinions he has  touched the   hearts   of 
matters  (and  wildly  varying matters  these  are!). Our latest interview with 
him,  of course, should be read. We asked him about the  Falcon,    the  Konix, 
the  Panther,   his  Beard,  shareware  vs. commercialism,  Men In Suits,  sex, 
Basingstoke,  Star Raiders,  God,  Inca Cola,   The  Number  and other  totally 
Ozric  things.   Whether  we  got  any satisfactory  answers or just a  lot  of 
chatting  involving   non-disclosure agreements  written  in  Norse  runes  and 
virgins' blood  instead  can  be judged by you in this issue of "ST NEWS"...
===============================================================================
 FURTHER INTERVIEWS WITH MARTIN "GRIFF" GRIFFITHS,  DREAM THEATER,  ABADDON  OF 
VENOM,  LOUIS  "WIRED  EDITOR"  ROSETTO,  DAVE  "STEN"  MOONEY,  SEPTIC  FLESH, 
AGGRESSION/BLOODHOUSE AND MORE!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Once more we have pained ourselves considerably to find interesting people  to 
interview, and this time significant aid was received by Michael "Chubby" Noyce 
(and his interviews aren't just white noyce!)...
===============================================================================
 ADVENTURE SOLUTIONS:  "ARTHUR, THE QUEST FOR EXCALIBUR", "HUGO II - WHODUNIT", 
"INGRID'S BACK", "MARTIAN MEMORANDUM" AND MORE!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Why   wait   for  multiple (or 'stranger') aeons   until   another   magazine 
chucks  out the odd tip on your favourite adventure that you've been  stuck  on 
ever  since  the week after you bought  it?  "ST  NEWS"  has  offered solutions 
to  over *100* ST and PC adventures.  You  need look no  further;   check   out 
the   "Adventure Solutions Index".  If your favourite adventure's not in  there 
then there's quite a chance it's not actually an adventure.
===============================================================================
 LITERARY BITS!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our #1 fiction contributor,  Mr Roy Stead, has given us the sole permission to 
feature  his  first complete novel,  "The Bloodless Coup".  The  bulk  of  this 
issue's "fiction" segment (as well as that of the next three "ST NEWS"  issues) 
will be taken up by that piece of work...
===============================================================================
  REVIEWS:  "FREEDOM" (ALTERNATIVE ITEM SELECTOR),  "ALIEN LOVE SECRETS"  (EP), 
"NELL" (FILM), "PYOGENESIS" (CD), "BACKWARD" (NEW VERSION OF THE UTILITY) AND A 
LOT MORE...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The various contributors to "ST NEWS" don't just use their  computers...  no, 
they  also read books and listen to various bits of digital  sound.  Sometimes, 
indeed,  they leave their dark attics to go out and mingle among other  mortals 
to see concerts and films and the like.  So some opinions may be found here  as 
well...
