        Hello! This is SANDMAN/FLASH writing  to  you... Yes: FLASH is
alive! FLASH was dead and buried when I left the crew in order to join
ANIMAL MINE couple of years  ago.  But  now  I  have left ANIMAL MINE,
because I haven't heard anything of  that  group  for months. So I was
forced to think that AM is dead.  Dead  or alive, it doesn't matter. I
didn't leave that great team  because  of  its lameness but because of
its lazyness. If there is still  someone  alive in ANIMAL MINE, please
forgive me if something I write here  is  not true. I wrote the things
as I knew and saw them. I  wish  all  the  best luck to all members of
ANIMAL MINE...
        
        But now back to FLASH. FLASH is not the same crew than it used
to be. All the lamers (except me?) were kicked out and they will never
come back. At the moment (25.3.1995)  there are four members in FLASH:
Sandman (organizer, coder), Exterminator  (graphics), Acorn  ( coder),
SVOS (musician).
          
          FLASH is international.  It   means   that  we  are  looking
for members in other   countries   too.   But   we  don't  hurry!  The
Finnish section of FLASH will be the  only one  at least till the next
year. At the beginning of  1996  we  will  (if   there   seems to be a
possibility or need for that)  form  new  sections at least in Germany
and/or France. If you are interested, just contact us!
        
        The forthcoming products of FLASH are FLASHY CHARTS #1 (in the
middle of June) and BACK IN  TOWN  -demo,  which will be released next
summer. We also plan to make  our  own diskmagazine called NEWS FLASH,
but that won't be before next autumn, so you can  keep on reading this
great magazine... Hopefully you find our future products amusing!
        What is the policy of  FLASH?  Well,  it could be written like
this: "ACTIVITY is good for you  and  FRIENDSHIP rules!" The two magic
words are activity and friendship.  Atari-scene has always been strong
when it comes to friendship.  Except  the  ancient war between TLB and
TCB there has been very good relationships between the crews on Atari.
Let's keep it this way! But the activity has been missing! That is the
reason why ST/E died. Everybody  just  waited  for something to happen
and nobody worked for  it.  This  must  be  changed.  And  I think the
situation is better on FALCON anyway.
