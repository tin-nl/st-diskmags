           THE POST-ULTIMATE GAME CHEAT-YOURSELF-TO-SMITHEREENS-BOOK
                             by Richard Karsmakers


 Welcome  to the third occurrence of this cheat encyclopaedia in  the  glorious 
history of ST NEWS (ahem)! This article previously appeared in ST NEWS Volume 7 
Issue  2  and Volume 9 Issue 2 - but not with as many cheats as you  will  find 
now. It contains all cheats that are compilable at the moment, and I've added a 
number  of Lynx cheats at the end as well.  I have reason to be certain of  the 
fact that never before so many cheats have been put together in one magazine  - 
not  even magazines with special cheater's digest additions!  The  totality  of 
this cheat list features a massive 393 ST cheats (and that doesn't even add the 
many  multiple entries containing different cheats for one game).  To  all  you 
hand-job  nutters out there I have also included 24 Lynx cheats,  and  for  the 
lucky few among you who have succeeded in laying their sweaty,  greedy,  grubby 
hands on the Jaguar, there's some stuff for you too (a mere 3 titles, though).
 By  the way,  only the "how to get infinite stuff/direct  level  access/hidden 
levels  etc." cheats have been included - so no hints on  tactics,  strategies, 
walkthroughs,  easy ways out, where to get keys in adventures, and that sort of 
stuff. You'll just need to figure that out yourself - I don't want to spoil too 
much of the fun.
 If  you're  stuck with an adventure you might want to check out  the  ST  NEWS 
"Adventure Index" article, elsewhere.

===============================================================================

 IT NEEDS TO BE PROCLAIMED: "IF THE CHEAT ISN'T HERE IT'S JUST NOT KNOWN!"

===============================================================================

 Credits mostly go to the computer press,  from which many of these cheats have 
been taken.  Additional credits go to some nice folk around the  globe,  mostly 
Mr.  Lee "501" Dumbleton, The Mercenary, Thomas Sandberg, Peter Hvezda (tons of 
Lynx stuff) and Chris Banham (much Lynx stuff too).  Some of our own have  been 
added,  of course,  so that this bit of writing is not totally ripped off. Only 
very few of them have been tested,  I hasten to add,  so basically all of  them 
could be fake (although, of course, this should basically not be the case).
 Do  note  that this article contains cheats to some extremely  ancient  games. 
Therefore,  I  have tried to add some of the companies that did the  games,  if 
known.

- A ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Action Fighter - Firebird

 Enter "ZBACKDOOR" as your name in the hiscore. You will get infinite lives and 
energy.  During  play,  you  can also press "Q" a couple of times to  get  more 
weapons.

 Addams Family - Ocean

 Dependent on the order of the game,  the passwords are  K11K9,  R1SK7,  RZ1R?, 
RDHIY and RLYK7.

 Addictaball

 Before pressing SPACE to start,  type "IJC". The screen will go black. You can 
now press function keys that will take you to the corresponding levels.

 Afterburner - Activision

 Pause  the game.  Type "THUNDERBLADE".  Unpause.  Pressing "G" will then  give 
extra missiles,  "<" will have you jump forward a stage, ">" goes backward, "N" 
gives extra lives.  You can also try pressing CONTROL a couple of times to jump 
to the next stage.
 Alternatively  you can enter "AGES" (which is "SEGA" written backwards)  which 
will cause only the ">" and "<" keys to be activated.

 After the War - Dinamic

 During  the  first stage,  press ALT+"B"+"1" for infinite energy and  time  or 
ALT+"M"+"1" for skipping to the second stage.  The code to the second level  is 
either 101069 or 101039.

 Agony - Psygnosis

 Enter  "FANTASY" while in the game and you'll be able to select  your  weapons 
with F1-F5. Return zooms you on a level (whatever that may mean).

 AMC (Astra Marine Cops)

 The     codes     for    this    game     are     "NOSTROMO",     "DISCOVERY", 
"ENTERPRISE", "DAGOBAH", "REPLICANT", "KRULL" and "METROPOLIS".

 Andes Attack - Llamasoft

 Pause the game and enter "DELICATE-SOUND-OF-THUNDER", including the hypens!

 Annihilator

 Press SPACE to pause the game, then hold down SHIFT and press the function key 
of the level you want to jump to.

 Another World

 The passwords for the levels are EDJI,  HICI,  FLLD,  LIBC,  CCAL, EDIL, FADK, 
KCIJ, ICHA, FIEI, LALD and LFEK.

 APB - Domark

 Type "ALF" in the hiscore table - then the fun starts.

 Apprentice

 Press  TAB  after  first title screen.  You can now use  the  following  level 
passwords: "WIZARD", "SPELLS", "ARCANE", "DRUID" and "FAERIE".

 Archipelagos - Logotron

 Select Archipelago number 8421 and then press ENTER twice.  Now you can select 
any Archipelago.

 Arkanoid - Imagine

 For  33 extra levels type F3 for one player,  F4 for two player instead of  F1 
and F2 respectively.
 If  you type "DEATHSTAR" on the title screen with the CAPS LOCK  key  pressed, 
"S" will proceed one level.

 Arkanoid II - Imagine

 Press CAPS LOCK and then type "DALEY88" for infinite lives.  You can also  try 
typing "PETEJOHNSONWANTSCHEAT" (without spaces!) on the title screen.  Pressing 
"S" will then cause the exits to open any time you want.

 Armalyte

 Pause the game and enter "DELTA3". You'll be invincible.

 Armour Geddon - Psygnosis

 If you want infinite credits, enter your name as "ALF" on the hiscore table.

 Army Moves - Dinamic

 The code for part two is "101069". Hold down ALT+"1"+"D" during the first part 
for immunity - in the second part you have to press ALT+"1"+"J" for this.
 You can also type in "KARENBROADHURST" on the title screen - though I  suspect 
that this cheat is not for the "Army Moves" made by Dinamic but another one!

 Astro Marine Corps

 The  level  codes  are:   "NOSTROMO",  "DISCOVERY",  "ENTERPRISE",  "DAGOBAH", 
"REPLICANT", "KRULL" and "METROPOLIS".

 Atomic Robokid - Activision

 Type "TUESDAY 14TH" on the title page and you will get a cheat menu.

 Atomino - Psygnosis

 A couple of passwords are "PLANKTON",  "INFERNAL",  "TAURUS", "PHOTON", "SOUP" 
and  "SULPHATE".  Another set I found  mentions  "ACID",  "ARROW",  "EMISSION", 
"LAVA", CAVE", ELIXIR", "BONE", "WOOD", "FOUNTAIN" and "GETWISE".

 Atomix - Thalion

 Press HELP to enter password mode and enter "TIME" for a frozen stop clock.

 Awesome - Psygnosis

 Enter the energy swap screen.  Move the pointer to where you get your  shield. 
Now hold down "+" on the numeric keypad and press fire.  The screen will flash. 
The functions keys will now do nice things,  such as give the different weapons 
(F1-F10 during play), disable enemies (F1) and restore energy (F6).

- B ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Baal - Psygnosis

 Get into the hiscore table and enter "LOVEBUNDLE" as your name. Choose another 
name  to  start  the game and press "P" and F10.  Then type  "FUCK  OFF  PIRATE 
BASTARDS" to get to the second level.

 Baby Jo

 Stage codes are "MUMMY" (level 2), "GLOUP" (level 3) and "YOUPI" (level 4).

 Back to the Future II - Mirrorsoft

 Pause the game and enter "THE ONLY NEAT THING TO DO".  The game will  restart, 
but you will start again with infinite lives.

 Back to the Future III - Mirrorsoft

 For  infy  lives,  enter the following during the  storyboard  bits.  Level  1 
"ROTTEN CHEAT", level 2 "LOUSY CHEAT" and level 3 "LOW DOWN CHEAT".

 Barbarian - Psygnosis

 Press 0,  followed by 4, and then the left-hand minus sign. Then press 0 and 8 
and the minus sign again. Now press 5 and 9 and voila! You'll be invincible!

 Barbarian II - Psygnosis

 Press HELP en then "M" and "E" simultaneously.  You can do this anywhere,  and 
you will find your energy refilled.

 Bart Simpson: The Revenge of the Space Mutants - Ocean

 This game may or may be the same as the Simpson thing mention with  "Simpsons, 
The", further on. So you'd better check there as well.
 Anyway.
 Type "EAT MY SHORTS" on the title screen.

 Batman the Movie - Ocean

 For infinite lives,  type "MAJJJJ" on the title screen. You can also press F10 
to skip a level.

 Battle Valley - Hewson

 Type "ROGER MELLIE THE MAN ON THE TELE" (with spaces) for infinite lives.  The 
last word may be "TELLY" instead.

 Beach Volley - Ocean

 Type "DADDYBRACEY" while playing.  F1 will advance you one  level.  Reportedly 
you may have to enter "DADYBRACEY" instead.

 Beast Busters - Activision

 Pause the game. You will find that you can still move the crosshair around and 
kill anyone you want until the screen is empty!

 Bellum - ST Format Cover disk

"CORNUCOPIA",  "PUNJABI", "TIDDLY POM", "KEWPIE DOLL", "SEPULCHRE", "EUPHEMISM" 
and "GRAMM".

 Beverly Hills Cop - Tynesoft

 Go past the hi-score to the select difficulty page.  Type "MELLIE" and you can 
go to any of the games.

 Big Run - Storm

 Pause the game and move the joystick  thusly:  Left,  centre,  right,  centre, 
down,  centre,  up,  centre,  up, centre, left, centre, down, centre and right, 
centre. You will have infy credy.

 Bio Challenge - Palace

 Press  ESC  to pause.  Pressing "G" will then bring you to  the  end  guardian

 Activate  infinite  lives by pressing the HELP key.  By pressing  "1"  on  the 
numeric keypad you'll get loads of dosh;  "4" will teleport you directly to the 
shop. Also, you won't lose your weapons if you lose a life.
 Another cheat is the following:  Press F4 on the option screen for  "impatient 
mode",  immediately followed by "S".  The screen will stay black.  Now type  in 
"PONDULIX  FOR  PM".  This activates the cheat mode which can then  be  toggled 
within the game by pressing the HELP key. The following keys do things as well: 
"1"  will give extra money to player 1,  "2" for player 2,  "4" lets  player  1 
enter the shop, "5" does this with player 2. "Esc" will skip to the next level.

 Blues Brothers

 Type in "HOULQ",  followed by the level you want,  on the character  selection 
screen.  So  that  would be "HOULQ1" for level 1 (though that would  hardly  be 
useful, would it?).

 Bomber - Activision

 When  you  enter  your  name as "BUCKAROO" you will  have  access  to  all  16 
missions.

- C ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Enter "SCHLIKA" during the game.  F2 will henceforth finish the level for you. 
Accidentally,  you can also pause the game and still move the crosshair  around 
(see "Beast Busters").

 Captain Planet

 For this one you'll need a copy of the game "Captive".  Insert this  "Captive" 
disk  when on the level selection screen of "Captain  Planet".  Press  fire.  A 
"Disk  Error"  will come.  Now insert the "Captain Planet" disk again  and  the 
cheat  is activated.  You can also press Escape during play to go to the  level 
selection screen.
 Another cheat for this game: Enter "CAAA" on the hiscore table and you'll have 
infinite continues.
