Thank you for buying this product. Not only is it a great game of extreme 
addictivity and playability, no, it's also as useless as a camel on the 
northpole (although some people smoke at such places).

Let us first explain the game. You are Copobor, the hero. You have to shoot 
all the friendly machinegun-carrying gangsters who pop up at times you need 
them the least. There are also various subgames, but as we are too stupid 
to get to them, we don't even have a clue of what to do in case anyone gets 
there.
