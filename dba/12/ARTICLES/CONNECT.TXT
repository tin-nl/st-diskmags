Following  on from this diskmag unified agency thing,  it occurred 
to me to see if we were making the best of ourselves in the  wider 
Atari  world..  Looking  at things from the point of view  of  the 
agency,  it  may  just  be  possible to see  the  beginning  of  a 
worldwide link and support for Atari owners across the world,,  

For example..                                  ~DISK.BLK~

 'MAGGIE'..  (not much on it's own..) But..

Connected  to  the Internet by The Reservoir Gods (who  appear  in 
Maggie under other names sometimes!) They are actively  developing 
for  the  Falcon,  and are in contact with several of  the  better 
known demo crews..
   ||
  \  /
   \/
Also connected via Felice (Richard) who is now establishing useful 
contacts  with  the producers of 'ATARI UNITED' diskmag,  and  the 
famous ATARI EXPLORER ONLINE e-mail newsletter/mag.. Both of these 
based in the USA..
   ||
  \  /
   \/
The  third Internet partner is Richard Davey of the Falcon  Owners 
Group,  (F.O.G.) who dabbles with his own diskmag,  FALCON DIGITAL 
UPDATE..
   ||
  \  /
   \/
Also now connected to us, is James Matthews and POWER DISKMAG, who 
represents a still active part of the UK Atari scene (yes there IS 
one!),  more  ST  than  Falcon based..  An active PD  library  and 
emerging software label also go with this person..
   ||
  \  /
   \/ 
Now it gets interesting.. DBA Magazine, who are in touch with many 
of  the  'scene' people,  and people as far away as  Hungary,  who 
would otherwise have remained completely unknown to us.. The first 
to  come  up with a really good Falcon diskmag,  and unique,  like 
myself in being regular working and tax paying stiffs without easy 
access to University E-Mail providers.. We suffer together!
   ||
  \  /
   \/
We  cannot forget Richard Karsmakers of 'ST-News',  who has had  a 
historical  interest in Maggie since issue one,  and has a  really 
decent working relationship with us right now.. He also manages to 
get  in touch with odd parts of the 'scene' (Poland,  this  time,) 
and via E-Mail, some of the more 'respectable' and adult people in 
the  Atari  world,  not forgetting Terry Pratchett!  He  'scooped' 
everyone  else by getting E-mail interviews from the producers  of 
'Starball',  and  looks  like  he  will do the  same  with  Unique 
Developments,   the   makers  of  the  top  Atari  Pinball   game, 
'Obsession'..

We  are not forgetting the fact that we are aided and  abetted  by 
certain PD libraries,  particularly MERLIN PDL, and that there are 
other informal contacts at all levels as well..

You  can look at this from the point of view,  of any of the other 
publications  as well..  Looking at it from the point of view  of, 
say,  POWER DISKMAG, would get the same end result.. The potential 
to  'spread  the  word' worldwide exists  now,  the  blueprint  or 
circuit diagram is detailed above..  Any suggestions, or additions 
to it are most welcome..

What we have now is a communications network for all things  Atari 
stretching  from  the  USA,  to the furthest  reaches  of  Eastern 
Europe.. Let's not waste it!! 

**JUST IN!** Tronic of Effect/Kuba are very active on the PD  side 
with EFFECT PDL, who distribute DBA Mag (up until they went Falcon 
only?),  ST-News,  Power Diskmag,  and now Maggie!  They have very 
wide contacts,  promising to spread Maggie 'everywhere'..  Several 
of their members are based in Iceland, which is another intriguing 
place this network ought to go!
