=========================================================
THE OFFICIAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE ATARI FALCON SCENE V1.0
=========================================================
                Done by Slimer


I remember an article from the Amazine diskmagazine featuring a huge list
of the almost entire Atari scene at that moment in time. Several changes
have took place since that article was published. The Atari Falcon got 
introduced and the ST/STE became outdated. In this period of time all 
democrews had to decide if they would leave the Atari scene or continue
on the ST or Falcon. Now most of those crews have made that decision and
the time has come for another round-up, just to see what's left.

I must state that several groups are still active on the ST/STE but we are
not able to make a roundup of them. Besides it's more important to look at
the Falcon groups. I think that we can conclude already that the Falcon
scene is much stronger than we've expected it to be. Take look for your-
self. The roundup also include groups who recently split-up or have quit 
the Falcon scene.

One last thing, I tried to make an accurate list but don't get mad if some
data is incorrect or a group is missing. It's quite hard to make a decent
roundup. This list will be published in every forthcoming D.B.A. diskmag,
so if something is incorrect than send us the right data and I will update
the list. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some explanations first:

We have the following order of data on the groups,

NAME    : Name of the group or individual.
MEMBERS : First the number of members (are estimated by insufficient 
          information) and their (or only the known) names.
REMARKS : The type of group and additional background information when       
          available. 
PRODUCTS: Only programs released on the Falcon to date.

STATUS  : Active       - If they recently have released a new production.
          Sleeping     - If no new productions are released but the crew
                         still exist (i.e. attend to parties or show other
                         signs of life).
          Dead         - Well that's obvious.

The overall data on groups and it's members are calculated with the highest
figure (i.e. 4/5 members, we use 5 to be save). members of dead groups don't
get counted (logically). Individuals (no member of democrew) are counted by 
the amount of members of active groups.
