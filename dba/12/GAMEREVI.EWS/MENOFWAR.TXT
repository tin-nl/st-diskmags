MEN OF WAR (THE GAME)

                             It's better to live one hour like a tiger
                             than a lifetime like a worm...

                                                      Cat 

We all know it, the ultimate battle. Men against men, alien against 
alien, mother against child (Is this the right picture alright ???
OOOOOh what the heck !).

The super new game with the oldest concept has gained new life. After
months of carefull programming the final answer came up.

A great game, addictive, great sound effects, 32 colors (for the 
moment) smooth animation (Smooth with a capital Ssssmmmoootttthhhh)
and lot's for more features (to come in the end release).

We at the DBA played it for several hours (even at the Fried Bits 
Party III together with Jade/Dune).  Yes it even outruns a Jaguar
with A.V.P. It is so great we put a small preview of the program with 
this issue of the magazine. Yeeeeaaaaaaah, and now your a victim of
this game.

It's a two player game, so you will have to get two normal joysticks 
and ofcourse another pair of hands to go with that. Besides that a
Falcon 030 with a RGB or TV should come in handy. Just start the 
MENOFWAR.PRG and a nice module will kick in. Just read the text
although it will not be much different from what you have seen here.

Hit a key and start playing ( do I have to say more ???)

Okay here are the game ratings.

Graphix : 10+
Sound   : 10+
Gameplay: 11

So I would say if the full version is out you should get it !!!!!

Signing off...

Bonus Software.



By the way..... Did I tell the game is a Bonus Software (DBA) 
production ???? I guess not but it really matter after this very
objective opinion about this game ????  (don't fall laughing about 
this)....
