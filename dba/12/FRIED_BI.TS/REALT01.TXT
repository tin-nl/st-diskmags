FRIED BITS 3 REAL-TIME P1
~DUST.FIL~

INTRODUCTION:

Here it is, the official (and only) Fried Bits 3 coding convention real-time 
article brought to you by The D.B.A. and Pure Bollocks diskmag. We want to 
thank the organization of this event for a very enjoyable time. We also want to 
thank them for allowing us to place our computer at a strategic spot. I hope 
they forgive me(Slimer) and Havoc for dropping in everytime with stupid remarks 
and questions ! Further more I would to thank all the attenders of this 
computer orgy for their contributions to our article, thanks guys !


BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

We don't exactly know how many people were present at the party but, we 
estimate it to be somewhere between 150/200 people. Beside the high number of 
people there was also an increase in international attenders ! Beside people 
from Germany and The Netherlands we also encountered people from Austria, U.K., 
Finland, Sweden, France and Poland ! I'm sure that I forgot one or two 
countries (forgive me for that). Although it was an Atari Falcon party there 
were also other computer platforms present like, ST(e) configurations, Jaguars 
PC's, Amiga's, Archimedes and a Sony Playstation ! 

Please guys keep it a mainly Atari Falcon party and don't allow the other 
platforms to take over ! Anyway we had a very enjoyable time and we're already 
looking forward to the next Fried Bits party. I've been to several parties but 
Fried Bits is still is the best one !

Okay, relax, enjoy, have a laugh,



THIS IS THE FIRST JOINT REAL-TIME ARTICLE MADE BY PURE BOLLOCKS AND THE D.B.A.

21:56 WINGIE, WHO THE FUCK IS WINGIE? Straight from Smallingerland this is the 
      fabulous havoc on da keyz.. Well, I've just got a tirade from dis strange 
      guy called Slima. He now tells me there's some stupid German trying to 
      bash his head on some stupid music (there are too much guitars in dis 
      world anyway...). Now he tells me not to write Smallingerland again, but 
      I will not give in. Smallingerland is the region (or what is it, in 
      fact?) where the famous city of Drachten is situated. It's not that I 
      don't like this city, but it's just mainly boring. Get your hands of 
      those keys you asshole. Oh shit, just forgot this is going to be censored 
      by the infamous DBA censoring company at Friwaco headquarters in 
      Drachten. Attention, would the driver of the car with those strange pink 
      inflatable dolls inside, please be so kind to remove his car from the 
      second floor of this building. German sucks, Slimer reckons. So do I. 
      We've just found a kid's book from 1953 in a rack not so far away, and b 
      therefore Slimer decides to get his photoshit. Now he has just taken a 
      photo from me, not realising that I'm totally opposed to photographs 
      because of my (love) religion (huh?). Being photographed is a sin in my 
      religion, and it will cause Slimer to be murdered straight away. Stupid 
      auto-save. I'm getting out. Bye.

      Respect us, reject the fuss.        gIaNtS '95.


22:11 und wieder hacke ich irgendwelchen Schwachsinn in die Tasten, nur um
      mal irgendwas geschrieben zu haben...   Egal.  Wir leben trotzdem noch!

22:18 Jau !! wir ham den Raum bekommen....(Archidemo..wird wohl was !!)

22:20 Just back from Bremen downtown :*)=

      After realizing that it's about to be summer soon, I'm not quite 
      computer anticipated at the moment. Bars and girls are more of mz 
      interest. Being a tourist from boring Schleswig, I`m fascinated of the 
      mid sized town Oldenburg. Well, back to the FB III ...

      I haven`t seen a lot yet, and actually have more problems handling this
      strange keyboard layout. But at this moment I think, I`m gonna take a 
      short look at all these flimmering screens standing around *everywhere*!
      It seems the Acorns got their own room, and that`ll be mz first target 
      because of the coming Atari emulator for Acorn RiscPCs! After that I`ll 
      check out if there are any new Atari Demos. Oh, have zou seen all those 
      freaky C=64 Demos? The "Obnoxious" wobbling has been done there too. It`s 
      almost unbelieveable to me! I guess that`s all for now, bze folks ...
      cookie ... writing just for myself.

22.35 No Pizza.
