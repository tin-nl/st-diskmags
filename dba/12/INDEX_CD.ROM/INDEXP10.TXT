The sounds in this directory are 8-bit sample files for use with Play,
Beep, Digital Keyclick, and EPlay (located in ../players/).  The sample 
data is in the same format as Mac sample data, so many of these sounds 
may look familiar to Mac users.  Jason Banham <cs89jmb@brunel.ac.uk>
reports that these sounds can be played on Acorn Acrhimedes machines
using a PD program called !DSEdit.
