EDITORIAL: The BEST of THREE worlds
===================================

** THE DISK BUSTERS ASSOCIATION IS BACK (and they brought some help) ! ** 

Introduction:

Your about to experience what some people already call a legendary issue of 
D.B.A. diskmag. It's the first diskmagazine made with full co-operation of 
both MAGGIE & ST NEWS, a co-operation that seemed virtually impossible only 
two years ago. Now the three oldest and most popular diskmagazines in the 
history of the Atari pull together for a joint production in the form of 
D.B.A. diskmagazine 12. Not only is this joint issue but we also formed a
diskmagazine agency, the first ever alliance between diskmagazine's in the
history of the Atari scene. 
You can read more about this alliance somewhere else in this magazine ! I
would also like to mention the other diskmags that contributed to this
production (Coma and PB Productions) ! 

Richard Karsmakers of ST News has witnessed the partial assembly of this
issue. He and some others of the D.B.A. team stayed at my place for a few
days. Details about this visit will probably be published in the forthcoming
D.B.A. diskmag or in ST News. 


New Features:

What does our mean new shell offer you? Well a very userfriendly, improved
and smooth graphical interface. This means sophisticated module control
options, controllable from anywhere within the magazine. Advanced help support
and options available in the shell and text displayer. We've got a 256 color
pic displayer and multichannel (up to 24 channels) modules playing at 50
kHz.! DSP sound support, faster loading, longer title names etc. I would
say look around and have some fun ... 
We are never finished improving this shell, so suggestions for further
improvements are welcome ! 


This is a probably the largest diskmagazine that ever hit the scene (in terms
of it's overall size). I think that everybody can find something worth
reading in this issue, just take a look at the contents summary,

THE CONTENTS OF ISSUE 12:

* The Fried Bits Eastern Coding Convention Real-time article.
  A personal view on the party can also be found in the subdirectory !

RECTIFICATION

The (the Dutch scene)'unity' article in the previous issue of the D.B.A. 
magazine was not written by any of the D.B.A. members. The author of this 
article goes by the name of Havoc. I felt an urge to correct this because the
article was opened with 'Diskbusters Association' drawn on top of it. Havoc
is also responsible for some of the graphics in the mag. (not mentioned in
the Colophon) ! 

Further more I would like to add to the Colophon the name of Greg(Coma) for
his contributions. He didn't ask for it but he gets it anyway. A bit sloppy
on my account, the assembly of the mag. was done in a big hurry. Well, I hope
the nightmares stop now ...

Enough egotripping, enjoy this Public Domain product and don't forget to drop
us a line. Our P.O. Box is wide open for everybody ! Support us and you can
look forward to another mind boggling issue of D.B.A. magazine very soon !
