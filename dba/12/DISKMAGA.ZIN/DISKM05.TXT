DISKMAG ROUNDUP P5
~TROEP.FIL~

ST Enthusiasts Newsletter

 Used  to be one of the very best quality disk magazines around,  from  editors 
Dave Mooney and John Weller.  Enthusiastic and very much alive. They started at 
issue 0.  A good and serious disk magazine with in-depth material,  even though 
it was slanted ever so slightly towards British interests.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Number 15 (late November 1993).
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead (unfortunately).
 Language: English.

STeve's AtariNOTES

 This is not actually a disk magazine but as it used the Fair Dinkum "Infodisk" 
disk  magazine shell to disguise itself as one I thought it appropriate  to  be 
included here.
 Basically it's a catalogue filled with "what to get at STeve's and how much to 
pay for it and how to order",  i.e. a blatant commercial thing and not at all a 
disk magazine. If you're looking for stuff, I suppose you could check it out. I 
think STeve is a U.S. company.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, the "Infodisk" shell.
 Latest known issue: Issue 2 (spring 1994?).
 Address: Couldn't bother to check this out.
 Health: Probably still alive.
 Language: English.

ST Gaming Digest

 An  on-line  magazine published by CyberSysTek and  edited  by  Eric-Alexander 
Bitton.  It's a US magazine that concentrates solely on forecasting games  that 
will  be  released on the ST/STE/Falcon.  If you read this magazine  you  would 
think  the  ST  market was literally booming (if not  exploding!)  with  games. 
Extremely  up-to-date  with  very hot information,  though I  suspect  lots  of 
rumours are included as well. It's monthly.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: May-June 1993.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.

STink

 Little  is known about this magazine,  other than that at least 8 issues  have 
been  made  and that it's been known to be referred to  as  "exotic".  This  is 
believed  to  be an understatement for "anarchist",  as it is said  to  contain 
description on how to make molotov cocktails and bombs and stuff. Hardly ready-
to-swallow  material.  It  is  rumoured that the police has  looked  into  this 
magazine and the people who write for it.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, probably.
 Latest known issue: Issue 8.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive? Dead? Exploded?
 Language: English.

ST Info

 This  mag appeared from Holland in 1987 and 1988,  initiated by Chun Wing  Lai 
from The Hague.  It was a good magazine,  but did not have a user interface and 
basically  consisted of a large "1st Word Plus" file like ST NEWS (Cf.) did  in 
its  first Volume.  Was supposed to fold and re-emerge in "ST  Bulletin"  (with 
user interface, Cf.), which unfortunately never happened.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

ST Klubben

 This  magazine  was started,  I believe,  in 1988.  It was  initiated  by  the 
infamous Nutty Norwegians.  It was almost an exact ST NEWS (Cf.) clone, founded 
by  ex-editor Ronny Hatlemark.  It was also a bit of a mag for members  of  "ST 
Klubben"  (a Norwegian ST club),  but a good one.  It was later taken  over  by 
Torbj³rn "Lord HackBear" Ose and his apprentice,  Karl-Anders "Wizzcat" ²ygard. 
After the fourth issue, early 1991, it ceased existing.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A good one.
 Latest known issue: Fourth (early 1991).
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead (may it RIP...).
 Language: Norwegian.

ST News

 Probably  the  oldest ST disk magazine,  started July  1986.  Originates  from 
Holland.  In spring 1988, editorship was transferred from Richard Karsmakers to 
Stefan Posthuma. With the latter departing from the editorial staff late spring 
1993,  editorship was handed back to Richard. It does not concentrate solely on 
the  computer side of things.  Not at all actually.  As of Volume 9 Issue 1  it 
claims  to  be  multi-media  and spends quite some  time  and  space  on  music 
(including interviews with musicians),  books,  films and whatever else may pop 
up or seem interesting.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. And a basic but rather nice one, actually (ahem).
 Latest unknown issue: Volume 9 Issue 3 (December 17th 1994).
 Address:   P.O.   Box  67,   NL-3500  AB,   Utrecht,  The  Netherlands.  Email 
  r.c.karsmakers@stud.let.ruu.nl
 Health: Alive and very much kickin'.
 Language: English.

STOP

 Never seen.  It is firmly believed to be dead,  too. All that is known is that 
it  once  existed and that it was a German-based mag of a  "GfA  Basic"  users' 
group.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Not known.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: German and English.

STOS Bits

 A  disk magazine aimed towards the "STOS" programmer.  It didn't have a  fancy 
user interface, was written in English and after the first issue continued life 
as "HP Source" (Cf.). This first issue was released in December 1990.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English?

STOS Giga-Zine

 There  are  quite a few disk magazines with shells programmed  in  "STOS"  and 
aimed at "STOS" users. This is another one, and a one-off attempt at that. Said 
to be really good, actually, even though the shell won't work on several modern 
system I reckon.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

STOSSER

 A  disk magazine that serves the fraternity known as "STOS" programmers  (yes, 
that "games basic" that works only on old TOSses).  It also features reviews of 
the  latest games and such.  Each issue usually has some sort of  "theme"  with 
graphics adapted accordingly,  quite an enormous amount of work I should think. 
The user interface is very nice, and I believe it's monthly. The editor used to 
be  a  guy  called Keefy,  at least up to and  including  issue  17.  The  user 
interface  is  programmed  in  "STOS" and we all  know  what  that  means...not 
compatible with Falcon or any TOS over 1.xx,  and it doesn't work on monochrome 
either.  It's  quite  good,  though  (both the user interface  and  the  actual 
magazine).
 Keefy apparently gave the whole thing on to someone else, Bob Goodfellow. None 
of his issues seen yet, nor is known what else will have changed then.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, and a nice one too!
 Latest known issue: Issue 17 (August 1994).
 Address: 57 Hearsall Lane,  Earlsdon,  Coventry,  CV5 6HF,  England (at least, 
  that's Keefy's address).
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.

ST Plug

 This  one  originates from Canada.  Editor:  Dan Panke.  The last  issues  are 
licenceware;  at least up to issue 7 they were Public Domain.  In North America 
they may be distributed by User Groups by purchasing "ST Plug" disk labels  for 
US$ 2 a piece. User interface allows pics to be shown through imbedded commands 
in the text. Offers many programs on disk.
 Status: Licenceware.
 User interface: A custom one called "Peruser".
 Latest known issue: At least 14 (August 1990).
 Address: 1670 Heron Rd., Box 22026, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1V 0C2.
 Health: Probably alive.
 Language: English.

ST Programmer

 This magazine,  written by editors Terry Mancey and Richard Gale,  is aimed at 
the  ST  programming fraternity.  Although one will not find the  hottest  demo 
tricks  here,  it  does  offer lots of useful information for  the  layman  and 
averagely  experienced programmer.  The mag even features some of the  editors' 
own programming things,  like games and such. Only works in colour and with TOS 
1.00  (at  least not with 1.04 that I tested it on some  time  ago),  which  is 
probably due to it being coded in STOS.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A STOS one.
 Latest known issue: Three.
 Address: 34 Austin Avenue, North Prospect, Plymouth, Devon PL2 2LD, England.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.

ST Report

 A USA-based on-line magazine.  One issue is made per week (just about). It was 
founded in 1987,  and its editor is Ralph F. Mariano. They offer a wide variety 
of news, also with regard to other Atari computers (such as Falcon and, indeed, 
the  Lynx).  It's primary advertising vehicle for its editor's ABCO Mail  Order 
Company (which,  according to British "ST Applications" Issue 27, is completely 
untrustworthy!).
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest  known issue:  Volume 10 Issue 34 (it's not clear which volumes fit  to 
  which year,  though, as Volume 9 was started in 1993 even though the magazine 
  then only entered its sixth year of publication.  Anyway,  Volume 10 Issue 34 
  was released on August 19th 1994).
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.

ST SIG

 Quoted to be "the first US disk-based magazine for the ST".  Well,  that would 
be true only if the first issue would have come out before mid July 1986, which 
may  be  doubted.  Anyway,  nothing  much is known about this as  it  was  only 
mentioned in a PD disk catalog.
 Status: Probably Public Domain.
 User interface: Not known.
 Latest known issue: At least Volume 1 Issue 3.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Probably dead. Maybe not.
 Language: English.

STuff

 A new disk magazine that appeared early 1994.  No hands-on experience,  but  a 
review  about  it  said  that it had a nice  atmosphere  and  the  writers  are 
enthusiastic  Atari  people.  It  works on the Falcon too,  but  only  in  high 
resolution.  Issue 1 is the pilot issue,  which has yet to grow in the  article 
department.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, an OK one with 3D dialog boxes and pop-up menus.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.

STuffed

 The disk magazine by Steve Delaney's "Floppyshop".  A rather nice  one,  based 
around a picture of a desk top where clicking on relevant items resulted in the 
loading  of submenus from which articles could be selected.  Pictures could  be 
loaded with the articles,  which was altogether a good thing.  Unfortunately it 
only worked on colour.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes.
 Latest known issue: At least 8.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

STUNN

 This is the "ST UNemployed Newsletter",  which is principally free if you join 
the group (which cost œ1). The magazine was quite slow and didn't offer lots of 
articles,  but the user interface constantly played some digi music - all  docs 
are loaded at booting.  It was founded in 1989,  but in 1992 it switched to PC, 
called "PC STUNN".  It's still pretty much alive there,  so I've heard,  and ST 
issues have been released on disk as well (?!). It's all pretty vague.
 Status: Public Domain (sortof).
 User interface: Yes. The DiskZine shell.
 Latest known issue: Number 15.
 Address: Is it relevant?
 Health:  Dead or alive?  After issue 12, perhaps PC copies have been ported to 
  ST disks?
 Language: English.

ST XPress

 An American disk magazine that offered lots of Public Domain software.  It was 
made by Rich Decowski, editor of the regular American magazine "ST XPress". Its 
custom shell could de-ARC programs and was quite OK.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one called "Diskmate".
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 7.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

Suomenkilieset Tieto-Sanomat

 God  knows  what  the  name  means (if he's Finnish  he  might  say  "News  in 
Finnish"),  and I guess nobody outside Finland will ever know.  It started  way 
back in December 1986 and seems to be the oldest Atari disk magazine but for ST 
NEWS (Cf.).  Its user interface uses hypertext links and all that kind of fancy 
stuff so basically the user interface is like "ST Guide". Unfortunately it's in 
Finnish which kinda limits interest to people abroad.  The shell is  programmed 
by Seppo Loisa and I believe the editor is Lasse Sundstr”m, who also intends to 
reprogram the shell so that it works in resolution other than ST medium and  ST 
high.  Like "ST Clubben" (Cf.) is was basically a disk magazine for an ST Club. 
It is released quarterly, though 1994 has only seen one issue.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom GEM one with a Hypertext system.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1 of 1994.
 Address:  ST-klubi  ry,  c/o Virtual Computer Finland OY,  Keskuskatu  6,  SF-
  00100, Helsinki, Finland. Email address is ljs@mits.mdata.fi.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Finnish.

Superguy

 A rather vague on-line sortof magazine,  or rather, a collection of individual 
stories that you get sent interactively as they are written. Basically when you 
subscribe  to  it you get about a dozen stories per week  (or  more)  featuring 
illustrious characters such as "Andy Awesome and the Awesome Force" and "Ramrod 
and Highjinx" in apparently endless sequence form.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Not applicable, really.
 Address: Email listserv@ucf1vm.cc.ucf.edu.
 Health: Very much alive.
 Language: English.

Syntax

 A semi-commercial disk magazine for adventurers.  Not much is known about  it. 
The  editor (who is female) is Sue Medley.  As it's coded in STOS  it  probably 
won't work on anything but old TOS 1.00 versions.
 Status: Semi-commercial (costs œ3.50 per issue).
 User interface: Yes, a custom STOS one.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: 9 Warwick Road, Sidcup, Kent, DA14 6LJ, England.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.

Temptation of Saint Anthony, The

 A collection of poems, observations, ruminations, short stories and rants. The 
focus is on the seven deadly sins. Recurring themes are piking fun at religion, 
dada,    heresy,    surrealism,    fundamentalism,    cannibalism,    insomnia, 
epistemological nightmares,  reinterpretations of folklore,  sex,  time travel, 
reincarnation  and  vice.  It's  edited  by  Mark-Jason  Dominus.  Sounds  very 
interesting indeed!
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Not known.

 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.

Third Dimension, The

 This is a multi-format disk magazine for ST,  PC and Amiga.  It's basiocally a 
gathering of ASCII text files (about a dozen or more) with various sound files, 
pictures  and  machine-specific  programs thrown in.  It  comes  across  rather 
chaotic,  and  I'm  not sure it's got a big market other than  people  who  own 
several systems. Its editor of Tony Hartley, who I seem to think is an ST owner 
at  least.  It's monthly,  and aimed primarily at people who are into  the  "3D 
Construction Kit".
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Issue 5 (September 1994).
 Address: 19 Kipling Close, Lockwood, Huddersfield, Yorkshire HD4 5HA, England.
 Health: Alive.

Toxic Mag

 A  disk  magazine  from  France that supports  both  the  English  and  French 
languages.  No further details known.  User interface is said to be great, with 
articles loaded upon booting reduced loading times to nill.
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: Said to be impressive.
 Latest known issue: Number 4.
 Address: TSB, BP 66, F-59240, Mouvaux, France.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: French and English.

Twilight World

 Basically the sequel to "Twilight Zone" (Cf.),  which had its name changed  to 
"Twilight World" to avoid problems involving trademarks. It's a bi-monthly all-
format on-line fiction-only disk magazine, with the first issue (Volume 2 Issue 
1)  released in January 1994.  It's edited by Richard Karsmakers.  Most of  the 
material comes from ST NEWS (Cf.), though especially the somewhat older stories 
are checked over, rehashed, updated and generally improved.
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 6 (November 12th 1994).
 Address:   P.O.   Box  67,   NL-3500  AB,   Utrecht,  The  Netherlands.  Email
