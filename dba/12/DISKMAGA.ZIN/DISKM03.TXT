Holy Temple of Mass Consumption

 A trendy pseudo-whatever online magazine featuring comic reviews,  zine  list, 
humour and a load of more stuff.  I guess it's stuff you have to read if you're 
in  any  way telling other people you're on the net or being "into  things"  in 
general. What a crap description, but what a heck.

HotFlash

 "Wired"  is  a  regular paper cyber/network/whatever magazine  in  the  United 
States  that's  incredibly cult and trendy and loads of other  good  adjectives 
(including "yuppie",  according to its adversaries). To stay in touch with what 
it is doing and get a weekly news mailing, "HotFlash" is the thing to subscribe 
to.  Subscribe by sending a message containing "subscribe hotwire" to the email 
address  mentioned below.  Despite the general uninteresting contents,  it  has 
been known to peak at almost 38,000 readers!  For help,  send "help" instead of 
the message mentioned earlier. End your message with "end".
 With  this  mail  server it is easy to get the full back issues  of  the  real 
"Wired"  magazine too - all you have to do is get all individial  articles  and 
glue them together.  And the actual "Wired" is to computer/cyberspace hobbyists 
and all intelligent beings what "Atari Explorer Online" is to Atari phreaks.
 Until Volume 1 Issue 22, "HotFlash" was called "HotWired" (Cf.).

HotWired

something.

HP Source

 A disk magazine that (also) payed attention to STOS programming, the successor 
to "STOS Bits" (Cf.). It also payed attention to "GfA Basic" and assembler, and 
had  a  much  neater user interface than  its  predecessor.  The  editor,  Leon 
O'Reilly,  decided  to call it quits after issue 2 as he considered  it  wasn't 
perfect  enough.  Rumours  have  it that it was intended as  sortof  an  undead 
"Maggie" (Cf.) but "Maggie" suddenly went undead all on its own so there.

 User interface: Yes, a custom one.

ICTARI

 According to an ad I read somewhere: "Are you an Atari programmer? It does not 
matter which language you use,  whether it be STOS,  assembler,  C, or whatever 
takes  your fancy,  you nee ICTARI,  the Atari ST Programmer's Disk  Magazine." 
Features sources and ideas for novices and experts alike.
 No hands-on experience. It's supposed to be monthly, and quite good.
 Status: Public Domain?
 User interface: No. Just use the desktop or a text displayer.

Inc Magazine

 A disk mag offered by the Incoders,  a demo crew from Sweden.  Made by a bunch 
of real enthusiasts,  but once said (I quote) to have "the effect of a bunch of 
schoolkids  leaping  up  and down"  (source:  "STEN"  disk  magazine  roundup). 
Articles  were short and its appeal was limited.  One of its writers,  one  Mr. 
Cool, went on to "DBA Magazine" after "Inc Magazine" folded.

Indy Magazine

 In mid 1994,  the latest hot thing,  presumably with monthly intent. Little is 
known about it,  however, at current, other than that it is released by a union 
of German crews calling themselves Independent (some 70 people in  total,  with 
some excellent graphics persons).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Probably yes.
 Latest known issue: None yet, except for the demo.
 Address: Unknown.
 Health: Being born.
 Language: Most likely to be German.

Inside Info

 A  bi-monthly disk magazine published by the New South Wales section of  "ACE" 
(Atari  Computer Enthusiasts).  It's basically a magazine for  members,  so  it 
includes meeting minutes and stuff like that.  Looks OK, especially if you want 
to  stay  in touch with down under.  Has a good shell,  but you  have  to  wade 
through a bit too much before you can get down to the actual reading.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, the "Infodisk" shell.
 Latest known issue: Issue 72.

InSoft Disk Newsletter

 A  US  disk magazine.  Nothing is known about the amount of issues  that  have 
appeared,  and  not even if the only issue of which notice was made (an  August 
1986 one) was indeed the first one.
 Status: Probably Public Domain.
 User interface: Probably. Not certainly.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Irrelevant.
 Health: Dead and decomposing.
 Language: English.

Interleave

 A rather excellent disk magazine with literary tendencies that, unfortunately, 
folded after two cult issues that appeared in 1991.  Its editor was Tom Zunder, 
who filled the mag with "software,  music,  films and sex". What more would one 
want?  Tom continued writing for "STEN" (Cf.) and "ST NEWS" (Cf.) for a  while, 
but was never heard of afterwards.
 Status: Licenceware.
 User interface: The S.A.N.D. shell.
 Latest known issue: Number 2.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

InterText - An Electronic Fiction Digest

 Like its predecessor,  "Athena" (Cf.),  this magazine is devoted to publishing 
fiction - lots of it. It's a network magazine edited by Jason Snell, and has so 
far  come out bi-monthly (except for four month gaps between V1N1 (March  1991) 
and V1N2 (July 1991).  The first issue was released around March 1991.  It's  a 
rather excellent magazine, capably edited and all.

Jag!

 "Jag!" is an on-line Jaguar-dedicated magazine in German.  I am not sure  when 
it  started exactly,  but probably around the end of 1993 or in  January  1994. 
Half of it is about Jaguar game reviews and all kinds of interesting stuff, the 
other half consists of advertisements.  It's released every two weeks,  and its 
editor is Carsten Nipkow.
 Status: Publis Domain, on-line.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: 3/94 (February 1994).

Lavarush

 Unfortunately not much is known about this disk magazine, as I only found half 
an ad of it (in the now long defunct English "Zero" glossy magazine),  of which 
I'll  share the text with you:  "Lavarush,  new ST diskzine for  everyone  with 
computer reviews, features, music, films,"...
 And, indeed, that's where it stopped. More info seriously needed.

Ledgers Magazine

 This was the demo group "Untouchables" disk magazine. It was very enthusiastic 
and full of humour (and indeed,  seemed to consist primarily of  it).  Featured 
short articles,  but many of them.  One of the better and definitely one of the 
most  zany disk magazines around.  Their user interface used to be a GEM  pull-
down  menu but later became a mega-demo-like playfield with selectable  bunches 
of  articles as opposed to demo screens.  The editor and chief coder  was  Matt 
Sullivan.  Neat intros.  Colour only.  They seemed to appear about every month, 
which was quite a feat!
 Status: Used to be licenceware, but shareware as of issue 9. Costs œ3.
 User interface: Yes. A fully custom one. It differs per issue.
 Latest known issue: Issue 13 (September 1992).
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead. Sometimes there's a tiny rumour of life, though.
 Language: English.

Leic ST

 This is a magazine that I have no personal experience with,  but it's said  to 
be  extremely  crap;  basically about 5 Kb of text with the rest  of  the  disk 
filled  with PD.  It appears to be monthly,  though this is  not  certain,  and 
doesn't really classify as a disk magazine actually.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, the "ST Zine" PD one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 26.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.

Lowell Review - Online, The

 An annual fiction/poetry/essays paper magazine initiated by Rita "Core"  (Cf.) 
Rouvalis.  It's pretty much in the same vein as "Core",  only a lot bigger. The 
"Online"  bit  is  basically just a teaser for the real thing  that  is  a  lot 
bigger.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: 1994 issue.

Maggie

 Having started in June 1990, "Maggie" (or "Disk Maggie") quickly became one of 
the very best ST disk magazines.  It was initiated by the British Lost Boys and 
at  the time almost entirely written by Michael Schussler (a German guy  living 
in England).  As of issue 8,  when Michael joined the Delta Force,  they became 
unbelievably much better, with a totally slick menu, much better music, picture 
and a fast page viewer.  Definitely one of the top quality disk mags on the  ST 
ever,  especially for the demo-admiring fraternity.  Issue 10, though outwardly 
still  brilliant,  was a real low because it featured a lot of rather  explicit 
porn, making it rather less suitable for the general public.
 A great turnpoint came in 1993 when,  with the release of issue  11,  "Maggie" 
turned  out  to have been taken over by some British guys.  All the  good  bits 
previously present were now complemented with much better writing and a healthy 
dose of enthusiasm. From that issue on, "Maggie" looks once more to be destined 
to be one of the very best disk magazines on the ST, Falcon-compatible and all. 
The editor is Chris Holland (CIH), and the mag attempts to be bi-monthly.
 Remarkably, it works on colour as well as monochrome.
 After  Issue  16,  a special "Maggie's Guide to Classic  Consoles"  issue  was 
released.  Although done with the "Maggie" shell (kind thanks to Chris), it has 
nothing  further to do with "Maggie" at all,  and was done by  Reservoir  Gods. 
Nice for old console freaks,  though (as in Colecovision,  Vectrex,  Atari 2600 
and the like).
 Status:  Licenceware  (up  to and including issue 10),  Public  Domain  (later 
  issues).
 User interface: Yes. A nice custom one.
 Latest known issue: Number 16 (January 1995).
 Address: 84 North Street, Rushden, Northants NN10 9BU, United Kingdom.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Previously English with some German, now only English.

Magnum

 A  Polish disk magazine made by the group Illusions (or Warriors of  Darkness; 
maybe they have several names).  The first issue was released in the summer  of 
1992.  Its articles are rather short and few, displayed in 40-column mode. Only 
colour monitors are supported.  It has a custom user interface where the cursor 
keys lead you through the various options and the space bar selects  them.  You 
have several menu screens.  The music is in tracker .MOD format,  and it  quite 
excellent. There are several modules in each issue.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: A custom one. Not too excellent, not too bad either.
 Latest known issue: Issue 4.
 Address: Ul. Bukowska 16/25, 32-050 Skawina, Poland.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: Polish.

Massive Mag

 This is a magazine produced by the Admirables,  the editor being a chap called 
Claff Moron (let's pray this is not his real name - no offense,  Claff,  if  it 
is!). It was made in France, and four issues have appeared before it died.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes.
 Latest known issue: Issue 4.
 Address: Unknown.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: Unknown, but probably French and/or English.

MAST Newsdisk

 In 1988, ex-US distributor of "ST NEWS" (Cf.) David Meile started his own disk 
magazine  with  the MAST user group ("MAST" was "Massuchusetts Atari  ST"  user 
group).  It was called "MAST Newsdisk",  of which only two issues are known  to 
have been released (the last one in April 1988).  It used the "Newsdisk"  shell 
program. After this magazine sortof ceased, suddenly nothing was heard of David 
(he got married somewhere,  I believe) and "ST NEWS" had to look for another US 
distribution channel.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. The "Newsdisk" shell.
 Latest known issue: Number 2.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

NASA Mag

 This disk magazine, of which little is known except for the fact that at least 
one issue appeared,  and that it is written in French and English.  It might be 
dead, it might be alive. More information required.

News Channel

 A  fellow Dutch disk magazine that arose somewhere in 1987 and survived a  bit 
over  1 year.  Somewhat notorious for its mainly polemic battle with ST NEWS  - 
mainly  concerning  them using their authors,  their music  and  their  foreign 
distributor network.
 For  a while,  some of the people behind "News Channel" seemed to  be  getting 
back in the picture with "STabloid" (Cf.).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 1.
 Address: No longer relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

News Flash

 This  is a disk magazine "in utero",  as Nirvanians would have it.  The  first 
issue is/was planned for autumn 1995,  so we'll just see what comes of it. It's 
made by the crew Flash,  from Finland.  The main head editor honcho seems to be 
Juha Vihriala.
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: It's bound to have a custom one.
 Latest known issue: None yet.
 Address: Eljaksentie 6, 62800 Vimpeli, Finland.
 Health: In utero, most likely.
 Language: English?
 Remark: "Eljaksentie" means "Road where moose cross the road".

Nova

 "Nova" is an Atari ST disk magazine,  non-profit,  released for the first time 
around spring of 1994.  It's dedicated to "Trekkies",  i.e.  fans of the  "Star 
Trek"  films/series and stuff like that.  The latest issue can be  obtained  by 
sending a disk and one pound plus SAE (or IRCs if you live outside England)  to 
James Bird (whom I assume is the editor) at the below address.

Nutworks

 Available through US networks,  this was a multi-format on-line disk  magazine 
which concentrates on stories,  jokes,  songs and everything you might care  to 
think of.  As they said,  it's "a virtual magazine for people who teeter on the 
precipe of insanity".  Not particularly computer-related. It started in January 
1985,  and the last reported issue was 1988's Volume 26.  Much of its  material 
finds  its  way into the humorous bits of other disk magazines  today.  It  was 
moderated by Joe Desbonnet.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface:  No.
 Latest known issue: Volume (issue) 26.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.

Omphalos

 A science fiction review magazine edited by John R.R.  Leavitt,  released  on-
line on quarterly basis.  Paper editions are available,  though you have to pay 
for  those of course.  The good thing about these paper editions is  that  they 
have artwork.  It covers books primarily,  but also spends attention to  games, 
TV,  magazines  and  films  (all of them reviews).  It's  available  in  ASCII, 
Postscript  and Hypertext formats.  Paper issue subscription are US$ 12  for  a 
year (i.e. four issues).
