THE MAGGIE GUIDE TO A CLASSIC VIDEO GAME LIFESTYLE
=================================================

This new diskmagazine is some sort of spin off from Maggie and contains
mostly data from the golden days of the 8 bits computer systems. The shell is
borrowed from Maggie but Chris (the editor of Maggie) has nothing to do with
this production. It's a member of the Reservoir Gods that seems to be struck
by dose of melancholy. The appearance of the shell isn't changed much except
for another font and some different colours. Talking about colours, the main
picture shows a mug shot of Pacman, an UFO from Space Invaders(clearly inspi-
red by the cover of a Boston album), both the Atari 800 XL and 2600 gamecon-
sole and the title of the mag including Atari logo. 

This issue contains data on the old Atari 8 bit game consoles, Atari 8 bit 
home computers, Colecovision, Vectrex and the Intellivision. Everything on
their hardware and software as well as FAQ and other information. It is a
very complete roundup of data and it could be of great use for people still
owning these machines. It's clear that there are still people longing to the
golden days of 8 bit computing ...

Conclusion

This issue seems to be number 1 in a series of 42, is the editor unemployed
or is this a joke!? This magazine is particularly interesting for people
owning or people that own an 8 bit computer system. I'm afraid that this
magazine is aimed at a select group of readers, people who have experienced
the golden days or still posses an old system.

It is hard to judge this production as it contains a roundup of old data and 
adds nothing really new to this world. 

NEXT!

MAGGIE 16 & 17
==============



This issue opens in the 'style' of ST format, I couldn't help noticing that
the Maggie Team aren't exactly avid readers of this magazine. The main
picture shows the average frontpage of ST Format with some sarcastic bits
added to it. Makes you wonder why good magazines always die first and rotten
ones survive, it's just like in real life, the bad people always live longer! 
I hope that this doesn't apply to diskmagazines though ...

Maggie contains as always lots of interesting articles, covering various 
topics. Issue 16 is the first one to appear in 1995 and therefore contains a 
summary of highlights of the previous year. The team has been out visiting 
several computer shows and complete reports on them can be found in this
issue. Further there are articles about shopping for new clothes, going on
holiday to Teneriffe, an interview with Impact Software and lots of other
things. Especially the news part of Maggie is always interesting and up to
date, definitely one of the strongest points of this magazine! 

In the 'goodies' department I stumbled upon a 90 percent finished true colour 
Bubble Bobble conversion done by the guys of the Reservoir Gods. This game 
looks very nice indeed and I can't wait to get my hands on the fully working
version. I would like to mention that it will be commercial release. Merlin PDL
will handle the distribution. 

ISSUE  17

An indeed short and hastily written review ...

This one made it just in the nick of time. I was already putting this issue of 
D.B.A. diskmagazine together. I've read a couple of articles and glanced at 
some others and decided to do a quick review of Maggie 17 ...

The things I've read were very interesting indeed. I saw a favourable review of 
D.B.A. diskmag 11, which I of course really liked. There was an interview with 
the coder of Lasers & Men (including a review of the game) and one with a guy 
from F.O.G. He had also some interesting things to say about our magnetic 
publication. Time after time I am peeking at the clock as the deadline is 
drawing nearer every second now!  

What more was there? Oh yes, some game and demo reviews as well as some 
previews of coming Falcon products. There was a piece on the Fried Bits party 
(Hope I didn't scare you to much, Mr. Pink!?)and some other events. All in all 
a very pleasant issue and I could say an even better than the previous one. Get 
your hands on it! 

Conclusion

Very pleasant issues with interesting topics and some very nice goodies. The 
overall quality can be said to be of an almost professional level. They still 
have me gazing at their articles with great admiration! I am looking forward to 
seeing the new Falcon specific shell and I have no doubt that it will be a good 
one! Keep up the good work guys ...
