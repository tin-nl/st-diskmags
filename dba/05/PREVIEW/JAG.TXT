JAGUAR XJ 220


Another racer, the Jaguar XJ 220

In mai if everything is going by the book, the new Jaguar XJ220
will test some of the new Atari circuits. With a speed of 212
miles an hour this baby will flash over your screen. In twelve
lands the Jaguar has to race over six fiction circuits, so 72
circuits in all for you to test. While you are playing sampled
sound and new music pieces will fill your ears.

Every land has his own "face" and difficulties. Hills, water,
rain and all those kind of things. And then there are also some
other cars filling up the roads. You encounter Porsches 959, Enzos
and even Lamborghinis and they will make live hard on you. So you
are warned. For those of you that often play Lotus or Lotus 2 the
gameplay will be very familiair, cause it seems the same routines 
have been used to make this car steer. Nice detail ofcourse are
the working breaklights altough we have seen it before...

It all sounds nice, pity the Atari version (sofar ready and known)
won't have the 2 player option the Amiga freaks have. I hope they will
change there minds and build it in after all...

The game is made by the Core Design group (made in U.K. no wonder 
they choose a Jaguar to play the main part !!) and the program
should work on an 1 Mb Atari ST.
 
Well we will see what it will be like if it is ready...
