After a long time of waiting, Atari has finally showed the world on the
CeBIT computer fair the new Falcon 030 !
The introduction was very inpressive with super music and great animations.
There is not so much information about the new machine, but i managed to
round up all the things i've read and heard about the Falcon.
There are many (paper)magazine's that have articles about this new machine
but i noticed that non of those magazine had al the data complete !
So here goes,

              oversampeling 80(!!!!) times
Colors      : Pallette of 16,7 million ( true ) colors.

              example: 640x480 16 bits colors (almost true color)
                       800x600 256 colors

               and some more (not known at the moment)

The Mic jack to do samples directly in stereo without a cartridge.
The DSP chip with 128k for digitizing color and mono screens in
real time, execute complex calculations or supporting cheap modems.

Just to give a small impression how fast this new one will be,
with pictures jobs in 640x480 in 256 colors the speed will be 6 till 8
times faster than the TT !!!!. I mean now we are talking about speed.

The Falcon can be used on every monitor from the SM 124/SM 1224 till a
( Super ) VGA color monitor.
You can use one monitor for color and monochrome.
The 68030 CPU can handle multi-tasking and for example network-intergration.
Quite cool don't you think, but what will be the price for this super work-
station ?
Hang on.......... 1500 guilders,5000 Francs, 4000 Quid, but these price's
are still rumours.
Release date: Around October, but we will see if that is really happening !

The Falcon can handle all ST software and the software-houses will get
the machine send to them for software development around the time when you
read this article.
There is just one thing to do now.......and that's wait till it gets on
the market( I'm gonna save all my money ).

                         See ya' all on the Falcon !
