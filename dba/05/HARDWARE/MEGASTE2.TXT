MEGA STE 2 TEXT

Hello this is O.T.M. behind his new board, of his new computer.
I bought my Mega Ste 2 yesterday, and now I will tell you 
something about it. 

A few months ago I went to the HCC in Steenwijk, and I saw that
K.G.E. had an Mega Ste 4. My nephew who had an MSX wanted an Atari,
and asked me what he should buy. I adviced him that it was best 
for him that he bought an Mega Ste 2, coz he only uses it for 
playing games, and a little bit of programming in G.F.A., and 
he didn't want a computer with one Meg.  

After a few tests with some software, we discovered that some 
software that doesn't work on a Mega Ste 4, worked on the Mega
Ste 2. This is probably due to the big memory of the Mega Ste 4
( four meg.)

Now further with my storie.
A few days ago we called "Byte" in Zwolle. I wanted just a 
Mega Ste 2, but the told me that they only sold the Mega Ste 2
in a what they call a busines pack. 

This Busines pack contained a scanner, a Mega Ste 2, and some 
extra software. At first I realy didn't want to by all that, but
later I decided that we should by such a pack, coz there was no 
other way to get a Mega Ste 2. 

First I will tell you something about the new Tos: 2.06.
K.G.E. who has a Mega Ste 4 had bought it earlier, and still had
Tos 2.05 installed, has installed Tos 2.06 later. Every Mega
Ste that is solled now has Tos 2.06 installed. 

These differences between Tos 2.05, and Tos 2.06:

1.
When you boot an Atari with Tos 2.06 you can see the Atari Icon.

2.
It starts a memory check, which you can stop by pressing a key.
 
3.
Then it shows a shrink bar which gives the harddisk time to get
at the right speed. You can also stop this shrink bar by 
pressing a key.

4. 
If you press <CTRL> during the booting, then the computer will 
not load the auto folder.

5. 
If you press <Alt>, and you type on the numberic keys an ASCII 
value it will show you that letter. For instance:
<Alt> 148 = ”. 

6. 
The Media Change detection works better. It uses Fat checksums, 
Ms Dos 4.x serie numbers, and much more other technics to detect 
data changes. 

7. 
Less more Floppy Checks. 

8. 
Empty Diskdrives will be detected faster. 

9. 
Disks with 1 Fat will be supported to be more compatible with
some Dos disk formatters.

10. 
High Density Disks will be supported. 
(I can not format one though K.G.E.!)

11. 
The VDI is improved.

12.
The Serial port is improved.

13. 
Some programmes which use Timer A will work better than before.
 (was it ever used then ...?)
14. 
Multiple AES events are reduced during scrolling.

Now I am going to tell you something about the Busines pack.

It has a Golden Image Handscanner, with a users manual.
It contains some software:
Touch Up: a complete design tool for monochrome images.
(2 disks and a manual)

Publishing Partner: Desktop Publishing program.
(2 disks and a manual)

That's Write : Text developer.
(2 disks and a manual)

Astodat 2020: data base
(1 disk and a manual)

3 D Calc: spreadsheet.
(1 disk and a manual)

The standard stuff: Harddisk utilitys, and a copy of the desktop.
(2 disks and a manual)

everything added up:- A scanner 
                    - a computer
                    - 7 manuals
                    - and 10 disks.

And that all for fl 2100,-- dutch guilders.

The desktop:

The desktop is very comfortable, you can install programs 
on your desktop, and under the function keys.

When you get the computer you have to install the desktop 
utillities. They are already on your hard disk, but in the 
control panel you must change the loading path of the CPX'es. 
And of course safe it.
