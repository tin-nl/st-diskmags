A few years ago Mad Max appeared on the ST. He made soundchip-music of a 
high quality for games and the ST-crew The Exceptions. 
More and more ST-crews walked into the ST-scene and they had great coders,
fantastic painters and some cool swappers. Almost no crew had an own 
musician. They made (mega)demo's and because of no musician the ripped Max's
music so when you had three demo's at that time, almost all the music was
the same. Then there was a fantastic demo from Inner Circle, The Decade
Demo. It was the first demo (I think) which had no ripped code (normal),
no ripped grafix and NO RIPPED MUSIC! The great composer and programmer of
their demo was and is Count Zero. He uses his own routine with his own 
type of drums.Many people talked about this piece of history which will
never be forgotten. 

Then Maggie Three from the Lost Boys came. It had music from Lap and ENS who
were new musicians on the ST. More and more ST-crews got theirselves a 
musician and more guyz got the idea the become a musician.
Nowadays there are lotsa groups with their own musician like:
Delta Force (Flix, Big Alec), Hotline (Synthdream), Syndicate (Frazer), 
Galtan Six had Dr. B but I heard he went to another crew, Sewer Software
(EVE (Yo Erik)), Sentry (me and Mac), etc.....

I'm very glad this has happened because I got sick of all the same Mad Max
music. Not that I hate his music, not at all. The new music he made for
Lethal Xcess, Ooh Crikey... is very good ! 

I think this is all I had to say.
