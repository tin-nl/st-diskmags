WHY MENUS
                             WHY MENUS?

First of all we can ask ourselves:
-Do we want to watch a demo 
            OR
-play a plattform-game?

A demo should be entertaining. If menus are made just to catch the 
viewers attention, is this the wrong way of doing it? We think so!
Of course there are good menus and bad ones, not to offend anyone....

Let's explain better:
Some demos contain menus which is just boring. Coz you have to steer
some guy for ages before you can watch the screen you want to look at.
Not everybody wants to spend hours and hours looking for the right 
screen. Could the menu be optional like "Punish Your Machine" by Delta
Force?
This was a great option, with menu AND F-BUTTONS.
(Great work Delta Force!!!!)
Why can't we begin releasing demos without menus and spend all the time
we use making menus, to make better screens?
Maybe we can start to make more multi-part demos?
Many demos have screens which look like intros. In some screens (which
isn't bad at all!), everything has to happen at once. Why? These
screens contain many great things, why not show them one by one?
This will make the demo longer, more interesting, and not so messy.
To Coders: Let people really enjoy what you are making. When you
execute a screen, POW! WOW! GREAT! (for 5 seconds) then there is just
the scrolltext left. Then you sit there reading it while those darn
sprites get in the way!!
Many groups have already understood the unecasserity about "Plattform-
game-menus" (If we want to play a game, we'll go and buy one!!)

All this is very easy for us to say since we are NOT coders, but we
just want to share our opinion about this.
We are not trying to offend anyone just trying to sort out the facts
about menus. We think that many will agree with us on this matter.

Whatever your opinion is, don't just sit there!!
Write and tell everybody YOUR opinion!!
