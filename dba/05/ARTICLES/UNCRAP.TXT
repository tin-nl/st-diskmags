                         Hi' Readers,

This is a short story, about some things that i would like to straighten
out.
I was reading this new diskmagazine called Disk Times by the Universal
Coders.
Altough i liked the articles there where only a couple of things that bugged
me somewhat especially the part about G.F.A. coders.
Our coders use a lot of G.F.A. basic in their program's( Bonus is mostly
coding in G.F.A./ASM and K.G.E. is mostly coding in ASM/G.F.A. ).
The UNC. guys claim that G.F.A. coders are shit and that they code in 
G.F.A. because it's so easy.
I also could make up from the article that they think that you can not
make demo screens that look as good as ASM. screen.

Hhhmmm after this magazine the D.B.A. coders will finish the Just Funnier
part B demo.
This demo will be coded in 100 % pure G.F.A. basic and will show things
that most ASM. coders can only dream about.
I know what i'm talkin' about coz' i've seen the screens for this demo
and i can't even believe it.
One small tip: Check out the Bee Forol demo when it is finished.

Hold it.....i'm not done.
You claim also that G.F.A. coders are lamers, i hope you don't meen that
our coders are lamers too.
Otherwise they must quit now, but then nobody will see the cool
issue six of this nice magazine and the second part of our demo !
Well, if you read this, you can always write a sweet letter explaining
this all too our main G.F.A. coder ( Bonus ).

I liked your magazine, keep up the good work !
