EMPTY....
                         EMPTY-BULLSHIT

"EMPTY" don't make much sense does it?!! 
What does it mean....? Is it how you feel when another boring "new kids"
love-song is blasting your mind to pieces? 
OR IS IT...........(inspiration problems)..........
Hrrrmmm...well....not much to say is it? 
Anyway, a poem to entertain.....:
         
                              EMPTY
               An empty bottle is lying beside me,
              I'm wondering: is it something inside?
        The bottle sure seems to be more empty than my head.
                (In other words extremely empty)
           Just thinking of it makes me feel.....empty.
         I quickly empty my head of such "empty" thoughts.
           Maybe I should look inside the empty bottle?

Oh, well, a rather extrodinary poem(?). What's the point in writing 
this?! Without this article, it would be an open space in this maggie.
And we want nothing of that, DO WE!!!
Open spaces are kinda empty ya know! Without emptyness everything
will be filled, like filled vectors! (Are there empty vectors?)
If there is, we want a COMPETITION!!!!!! (How very, very, exiting)
(No prices!!)

THE FIRST CREW WHO COMES UP WITH A HALF-EMPTY/HALF-FILLED VECTOR 
ROUTINE IS TRULY GREAT!! (This is serious stuff)
In the coder language this means half-filled and half line-vectors. 
(Won't this be fun!!? We think so!)
No more bull this time!
Another stupid article in another disc-mag (fun huh?).
Contact us for any reason (addy=latest releases).
