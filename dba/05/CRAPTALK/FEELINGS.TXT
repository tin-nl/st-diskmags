FEELINGS

                                FEELINGS

Do you ever have the feeling that when you turn on your computer
your whole world will collapse?

Or for instance when you turn on your radio that your feel the 
energy floating through your body into your mind, and does
it make you sick?

Or when you see a friend you suddenly feel the urge to eat up 
all your disks, and throw a magnet to your friend?


Or when you are typing behind your computer you feel that you 
loose your fingers, coz they are drowning into the keyboard?

Have you ever had the feeling when you saw a diskmagazine that
you want to throw up and smash your monitor against the wall?

Do you feel sometimes such kind of feelings?




I don't...


O.T.M.
