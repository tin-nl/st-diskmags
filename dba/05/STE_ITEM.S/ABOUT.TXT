ABOUT THIS CORNER
                             About STE-corner
                             ----------------

   Here it is again! After D.B.A. released my first corner, I decided to
write the second part too. The last one was made in hurry, and you could
see it specially from coding-part. Well, no explanations, let's tell you
what there are this time...
   I didn't make a new coding-course, because I am personally now learning
new ways of coding. When I've finished my own assembler trials, I will
write another coding-course... so that was it about coding now!
   News are of course included for this corner too. Because this is "STE"
corner, I tell STE-only news... And this time I couldn't get very much 
news for you, but hopefully you can enjoy what you've got...
   Here is reviews of a few STE-demos too. They are not perhaps the latest
but anyway they are one of the best, that I've seen...
   No more bullshit. If you think this corner is lame (?), maybe you could
help me. I can't review the latest stuff, or tell the latest rumours
without your help. So please send me news, rumours and the STE demos, that
you haven't seen reviewed before.
   My address is:

P.S.   You can of course contact me for any other reason too. If you want
       to be greeted in our future-productions, or you want to make demos
       with FLASH, it is a good reason to write!

P.S.2  Let's make this corner the best one in the whole STE-world!!!
