There where questions about why we don't pack our text files,
okay here are some anwers...... 

We don't pack the text-files, coz' we don't like waiting for them
to unpack after they are loaded and of the fact that the magazine
program uses a special file reading procedure !!
But maybe we change or mind........

Cyberpunks programming files where lost due to a error, it's to
complicated to explain( something with a harddisk ).
But i hope you forgive us, where only humans.........

We where overwelmed by the many reactions, articles, proggy' and 
pictures and we really hope that you will keep sending us that
stuff.

ST Magazine( French ) had a article about disk-magazine's and we 
where among them.

We had a good review( pitty that they only had the first two mags.).

Our fake soldier( Ecto 1 ) is in vacation paradise in the Dutch airforce
He' gets the easy jobs, he will never be a real man( ? ).

Bonus buyed a other car ( again ) this time it's a Peugot 505 GTI.
He only uses it to go on vacation and then he sales it again to buy
a small (fast) car and a motercycle.
Some people say that he changes faster his cars then someone else
changes his underwear !!
So, if you see a grey flash on the road, you know who that was........

K.G.E. ownes a Porsche( this makes the D.B.A. one of the fastest crews
around ).

The D.B.A. has the most souped up ST(E)'s around ?
Some of the D.B.A. members own two computer( ST and STE ).

The computers of Bonus and K.G.E. are build in PC body's with lotsa
extra stuff in them.
That stuff include Harddisks( lotsa megs. ), extra memory, 1.4 meg. drives
( 3 1/2 and 5 1/4 ), ripper catridges, sound samplers, car boosters, equalizers
and some more junk. 

Most people send us the wrong solution to the puzzle in diskmag. 3.
They all forgot something different in the sentence.

We got lotsa new thingy's in this super magazine and that we've got
a really great price in the contest corner.
Solve the puzzle and you get a great price, read all about this in
contest and hardware review corners.

I really hope that we scared the shit out of some of the other magazine
teams with this inproved magazine !
You never know what we've got more in store for you( ha ha ha ).

We've got top programmer's writing for our coding corners ?
Check out who are writing these corners !

We got a couple of people who writing on an permanent bases for our 
cool magazine.

On the time that i wrote this sentence it was 29 march and magazine 3
is only 4 weeks out.
But we've got so much articles in 3 weeks( 1 week to reach our contacts
is not counted for ) that this new diskmagazine is almost full.
I have only 200 kb. left and that's without the intro and some articles
that i haven't even placed yet( this is gone get rough ) !

It's still 29 march, i've got only a review version of this new magazine
to work with but it seems to work good.
Altough there are lots of options missing at the moment, i found no real
bugs but you never know what happens when Bonus inplents the new options.

This is the end ??
