----------------------  AN ORAL WALKABOUT 2 ----------------------

                  - its base on the Arturian legends and Akiro 
                    kurosawas The Castle in the forest (or something
                    like that)  
                              
                  - Ecto 1 sent me DBA 3 a couple of days ago

                  - my STOS column was in it
                  
                  - my STOS files wasn't in it (why is that Ecto 1?)

                  - DBA mag isn't packed 

                  - i don't know why

                  - my pics in Netslide 3 and 4 are double packed

                  - you saves loads of memory that way
                          
                  - Net slide 4 has a new intro

                  - its not as good looking as it should have been 

                  - it looks incredible for a STOS intro
                   
                  - it has a girl scrolling downwards at two pix an up-
                    date with a parallax background, and it has four 
                    pic equs and a little scroll that follows the mid
                    equ. All in all i scrolls or animates all pix on
                    the screen 50 (or 60) times a sec

                  - it uses less than 60% of the time

                  - it's pure STOS coding 

                  - it's just a big cheat (as if you didn't know)

                  - if you doesn't understand how it works then i'll
                    tell you here: What moves doesn't and what doesn't
                    moves!   
                  
                  - its like the ships in Star Wars, it looks like the
                    ships are flying around but in reality they stands
                    completely still while the camera moves around  
 
                  - i just turn of the video as it finished 808 States
                    Cubik an turned on the back tracker STE

                  - Karl Anders must have fucked up badly as Back 
                    Tracker just informed me that i was out of memory

                  - i uses a 4 meg and cant be out of memory at this
                    point
                   
                  - the prog might be right as a WP toolkit just 
                    informed me that i have 31k left 

                  - i cant figure out where all that memory have gone

                  - i'll think i'll save and reboot to check this out
                  
                  - i just fixed the problem, i had to start B.T. before
                    i started First Word

                  - i now have a 25hz tracker playing while i type this
                    shit 
                   
                  - i can still hear the clicks from the typing, but the
                    warning bleep from misspelling sounds like ditttdutt

                  - it looks like First word only leaves 32k after it
                    loads on all machines even if you got tons of memory
                  
                  - the guys that made the Danish demo i mentioned used
                    a null modem cable to transfer modules from the 
                    Amiga to the ST, why didnt they just use a multi 
                    dos prog? 

                  - some of the digis i used as sketches in net slide 4
                    were digitized on the Amiga, converted on the PC and
                    finally read into NEO and used

                  - Corell draw on the PC is incredible slow 

                  - Deluxe Paint in HAM mode is even slower on the 
                    amiga 

                  - i loaded a HAM interlace pic into DP and i 
                    thought that the programme had crashed as nothing
                    happened for several seconds, the reason? i had 
                    the zoom on!

                  - there are no good pure GFX progs on the amiga
                    but there are several good raytraisers

                  - DP worst handicap is the bad design and layout of
                    the icons and functions 

                  - it has the clear screen and undo side by side, press
                    on the wrong one and you can undo the clear but not
                    the mistake you made, grate or what!

                  - i'm just watching the late news on the telly and 
                    a guy that wants to run for president in rusia wants
                    to go back to the borders of 1913, that includes 
                    Finland and Alaska! In the last election this guy
                    got more than 6 000 000 000 votes, today he might 
                    get more than 10 times of that!

                  - i don't think FOF or any other Fin likes this idea

                  - this is the 11. march 1992 (just noted that for the
                    historian that are going to read this the 14. of 
                    May in the year 4668) 

                  - if a historian reads this the 14. of May in the year
                    4668 he is feeling rather spooked right now   

                  - sins this is the year 4668 you are probably a
                    computer!, and you probably lives on another 
                    planet than earth if you lives on a planet at all
                    that is

                  - i'm sorry readers but i'm just making this file
                    the classic file to read in the year 4668

                  - Prince's song 1999 is gona be a hit in 1999 even 
                    if we are in the middle of a world war

                  - i hope world war III starts between 1996 and 2000
                    or i have to change my game plot! 
                                    
                  - if you moves the letters HAL one step down in the
                    alphabet you get IBM

                  - if you don't know what HAL 9000 is, you are not
                    worthy to read this file, so stop it will ya!

                  - a guy in the late news just came with the most
                    stupid question i have ever heard, it was: you
                    probably likes good music, don't you! Is this 
                    man a complete dork? if he dosnt like some music
                    he wont think it's good would he! 

                  - this file is getting rather long now

                  - its now page 8 in First Word
                  
                  - i just feed the cat

                  - my sisters dog and the cat doesn't like each 
                    other 

                  - the cat is twice as big and ten times as heavy as
                    the dog

                  - the cat is at times rather dangerous 

                  - Dizzy T. (Hello Stein Arvid du har navnet ditt i 
                    et disk mag!!!!) noticed that when he was here  
                      
                  - when the cat tried to eat Dizzy the cat was still 
                    rather small, it aint small anymore, and i have
                    scars to prove it! 
                     
                  - today is the 14.03.92 huu thats by birthday i think?
                    Yeah it is, i was born on this day in 1969

                  - i dont really care, i have never seen the point in
                    celebrating that you were born on one particular day

                  - KLF's America: What time is love? (Uncensored) is
                    the greatest song made since Johny Rotten screamed 
                    God save the Queen
                  
                  - the most accurate description of America i have
                    heard was Alex (Noregian tv star) saying 'Americans
                    are so bad dressed, the entire USA is like a big
                    bad taste party'

                  - KLF's White room album aint that good

                  - KLF have made a album called Chill out, i have it
                    and i must admit that it is rather wired

                  - last years best album was Electronic by Electronic

                  - all the songs on that album are either extremely good
                    or better

                  - on the back of TenTec's Atmospere album you can find
                    the words 'Performed by Atari 1040ST'

                  - that album has songs that are as good or even better
                    that those by J.J.Jare and Vangelis                     
                                         
                  - there's a virus on the orginal Deutoros disk 

                  - its the Signum BPL virus

                  - its on the datadisk

                  - i read that in ST Format, the only ST only mag sold
                    around here

                  - ST format had something useful on the cover disk!

                  - that's probably the first time it has happen

                  - STOS 3D is here

                  - i have bought a issue of The SUN 

                  - the famous page 3 is on page 5

                  - its the only newspaper with worse english than 
                    your average disk mag 

                  - over 90% of all norwegians over the age of 14 reads
                    at least 1 newspaper a day

                  - the girl with the longest legs in britain is
                    rather good looking (she's on the cover of The
                    sun)

                  - Sun Exclusive usually means that nobody else
                    bothered to print it

                  - The SUN cant really be called a newspaper 

                  - its more in the style 'Wonder what crap they have
                    printed today'

                  - in S³r-Tr³nderlag in Norway there are a community
                    committee with the name 'Klagenemd For Behandling
                    Av Klager Over Avslag P† S³knad Om Bruksrett Av
                    Spesialtransporttjenesten For Funksjonshemmede I
                    S³r-Tr³nderlag' 

                  - that is 126 letters! 

                  - i wonder what they answers the telephone with

                  - Hell is in Tr³nderlag

                  - i have been there several times 

                  - the x-miss world from Norway comes from that place,
                    a real bimbo fro Hell 

                  - in the train station you can find the sign 'Hell
                    stasjon - Godsterminal'

                  - its bloody cold outside, we even have snow

                  - the cat lies on my bed

                  - F Guy from France just pased 5km on the telly

                  - i'm getting bored 

                  - i just got the urge to see Akira (again) but some
                    Amiga freak saw the tv prog that had cuts from it
                    and he came over to lend it the following day....

                  - i think i'll put on Total R. instead 

                  - Carolco presents Total Recall......

                  - we are now on mars...

                  - egger wakes up, mars was a dream...

                  - i'll stop commenting the film

                  - Douglas Quaid (egger) wasnt exactly a superhero in
                    the book

                  - in 2084 they still have normal monitors on the 
                    Subway and not LCD screens 

                  - i did say i should stop commenting the film...

                  - i just turned on a Iso Ion as the cat smells a bit

                  - This is the end
