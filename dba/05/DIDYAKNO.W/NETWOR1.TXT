----------------------  AN ORAL WALKABOUT 1 ----------------------

Did ya know that: - Sigaya Miyamoto is to be blamed for the grey 
                    box that goes Bleeeeep (also known as NES or
                    Nintendo)

                  - Heimdall is misspelled, It should be Heimdal
                
                  - Heimdal means Home Valley 

                  - i just have released Net Slide 4

                  - that it has two small bugs

                  - that i will be as lazy in spreading it as  i 
                    have always been...

                  - Imagina have released a new demo.

                  - its called X-plotion or something like that

                  - a danish demo called The supreme demo has just
                    been released

                  - i just did something on my game

                  - the games name is Corcon 7

                  - its gona be gigantic 

                  - but sins i am working the proging goes slow 

                  - its name comes of the easiest remembered letter,
                    C pronounced K (like in CANON, CONAN, CODAC, 
                    CAD/CAM, COMMODORE etc...)

                  - that a C followed by an O is even easier to 
                    remember
                  
                  - the number 7 is also the number easiest remembered
                
                  - i made the name for purely commercial reasons  
                              
                  - if you have read or heard Corcon 7 a couple of 
                    times your brain will newer forget it!

                  - if i bothers to, Corcon 7 will have 9 parts

                  - the first part to be released is part 4

                  - part 4 is called : The lost colony on Corcon 7

                  - the parts are

                    1: The Beginning (World War III)
                    2: Our home: SPACE 
                    3: Mutant Machines (Blood 'n' Oil)
                    4: The lost colony on Corcon 7
                    5: Return to moon Alpha 
                    6: King of Corcon 7
                    7: Vengeance (The fall of the machines) 
                    8: The Corconinan empire 
                    9: The Reb's
 
                  - i have actually planed what all the parts should 
                    be about and how the gameplay should be!

                  - that Ultima has only reached part 6 (i think) so
                    my plans looks slightly mad

                  - you can do things in Corcon 7 that have no 
                    relevance to the plot, like do some trading and
                    visit the arcade and casino etc...

                  - it might be a 1 meg only

                  - you only need 10 keys or a mouse to control it

                  - i'll probably use PACE coding (NATO standard) on 
                    the missions text

                  - all words in PACE has only 2 letters 

                  - in war time all these codes are changed each day

                  - i won't do that in the game 

                  - Corcon 7 is a RPG/WAR/ADVENTURE/TRADING game  

                  - the STE on my pictures means that i uses the STE
                    colours (get it Ecto 1)
  
                  - World War III will start soon (1996 - 2000)

                  - It will be between the West and Muslims/Asian 
                    countries 

                  - it'll start in what we knew as SSSR 

                  - it'll go nuclear

                  - at least 1 000 000 000 people are going to die

                  - the end of it will wake people up 
   
                  - this will be the start of the new Space race

                  - all this according to the Corcon 7 plot and a man
                    called Nostradamus 

                    to our norwegian readers the carton shoved in the
                    TV program about future citys in Japan is from 
                    the Akira movie mentioned in another article.

                    writes this article (10.March.92)

                    to buy it from Akers Mic.

                    and i would give you a copy of Akira.
                  
                  - i love bad horror movies 

                  - the worst movie ever made is Lethal Weapon 2

                  - Silence of the Lambs is highly over-rated

                  - it has nothing original  at all, i have seen it
                    all before

                  - this shows that normal people and critics sees to
                    few thriller/horror movies

                  - as soon as you put some known stars into an average

                    Pimps Association)

                  - 90% of american women are prostitutes (according
                    to Hollywood movies)   

                  - several low budget tenage movies shows drug abuse
                    in a positive way because they are made with mob 
                    money

                  - they'll newer play that one on the BBC 

                  - if you want to say or play something rather dirty on
                    the norwegian radio you can do it in english as the

                  - with a digital camera and a good computer you 
                    could easily do most of the SFX in it at home

                  - some of the SFX doesnt look to good in slow motion
