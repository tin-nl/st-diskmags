SORRY FOLKS



Sorry folks,    :-(

We had so much to this time with the new version of the
magazine we couldn't re-view all the new software at once.
So not all re-view are as new/big as we would want them
to be. But now the new shell is ready we will make bigger 
and better re_views again.

But if you want and you have a piece of special software
send in your own re-view. This way we all get a better 
view of each program. If we get more re-views of one prg
we can put them together and see what everbody is thinking
about the same prg...
