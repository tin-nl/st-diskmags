           AMPLIFIER REVIEW: THE NAIM NAIT 2

***********************************************************

The Hi-Fi firm Naim Audio is more then 20 years a very
respected manufaturer of audio components.
What ones was a one man firm is now an firm with more then
sixty employers.
Very famous are the Naim Nait amplifiers and in this article
i'm going to review the cheapest of the serie's called the 
Naim Nait 2.

Sometime ago a friend of myn bought a new amplifier, so he
called me to come over and check it out.......
Well, it turned out to be an Naim Nait 2 amplifier,i always
wanted to listen to one, so this was my lucky break !
I listend the whole evening and we tested all sort's of 
music with the CD-player and with an turn-table( a very good
one, though ).
So, back home i searched my house for information about the 
Naim Nait 2 to get my review complete and i found some !
Lets fly.........

When i first saw the Nait 2 i saw a little black box with a 
view knobs on it.
There is no bass and treble, no loudness button, no filters 
and other stuff on this amplifier, only the things you 
really need are on the Nait 2.
The only extra thingy is the option to listen to your ( 3 
head ) tapedeck while it's copying.
You get only volume, on/off, balance, input selector and 
tape monitor selector knobs.

The amplifier was connected ( and still is ) to some Royd
audio speakers( i forgot the type ).
We used a Technics Mash CD-player and a very good turn-
table( i'm getting brain-dead, i forgot what it was ). 
So, we put on Pink Floyd with the Wall on the turn-table
and we we leaned back in our chairs.
Boy, was i suprised when the music started to play and
i saw a big grin appearing on the face of my friend.
The music was so clean and so pure that i almost forgot
that i was listing to some loud-speakers.
It seemed that Pink Floyd was playing in the livingroom.
After listening a while i noticed the lack of a good stereo
" view "( read about it in the big loudspeaker review in the
previous issue ).
The Royd speakers where standing to close to the window, 
this is now solved by putting them on stands further away
from the backwall and window.
I found much detail in the music and i was really stunned !

Before you run to the store and buy this amplifier you must
know that they are rather expensive.
You can get an amplifier of the same quality for halve of 
the money( Cyrus one ).
The Naim Nait 2 is a amplifier for real audio freaks who 
are willing to pay more to get a real Naim product !
You pay a view bucks for the name.

You can use this amplifier also as an pre-amplifier in 
combination with an end-amplifier.
Naim has got a wide range of end-amplifiers to choose from.

Now for some figures........

Power rating at 8 ohm:  2 * 45 watts
Price                :  between the 1600 and 1800 guilders
                        ( around 700 dollars )

I didn't mention the rest of the figures, coz' i really 
didn't had so much info. about them.

FINAL CONCLUSION:

A very good amplifier with clean and pure sound.
You really get in the music and it reveals all the details 
in the music.
The amplifier is rather expensive coz' of the fact that it's
a real Naim Nait amplifier.
This an amplifier for THE real audio freaks.
