                    SOME THINGS ABOUT COMPACT DISC'S

1. Always pick up your CD with your fingers on the edges, this prevents
   you to make dirty fingerprints on the CD.
   If you always follow the first two tips the CD never needs cleaning.

2. Always put your CD('s)in the box after you used them.

3. When you buy a CD check it for tiny holes( sometimes you can discover
   them while you hold your CD against light, it looks like someone used
   a needle to perforate the CD with ).
   These holes sound like " ticks " in the music, this happens everytime
   the laser passes these tiny holes, if a hole is to big the CD-Player
   will crash !! 

4. There are spray's that leave a thin coating behind on the CD, this
   coating protects the CD against scratches.
   It even prevents blistering of light ( this means that the laser inside
   your player reflects a bit on the CD, this will disrupt the laser a bit
   but with the coating it will make the music a bit cleaner !)

5. There are rubber rings on the market that you can put around the edges of
   your CD.
   These rings will stabelise the CD in your player and that will give a
   cleaner sound( you get the biggest results with cheaper Player's ).
   Sometimes the edges of the CD are not perfectly shaped and then the ring
   around the CD will cover some of the last data on the CD.
   This will make your CD-Player crash when he wants to play the last minute
   on the disk.

6. Do not use agressive fluids on the CD's, this may well damage the 
   thin coating on the CD ( this also goes for the spray coatings ).
   A soft cloth and some special cleaning fluid mostly will do the trick.
   This cloth must be clean, lint-free and soft.

7. Always clean the CD from the center to the edge( in a straight line ).

8. Last note: The Compact Disc is not so perfect as they sometimes clame,
   so handle them with care.
