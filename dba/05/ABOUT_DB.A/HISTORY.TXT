AT THE BEGINNING..


At the beginning there was nothing...

Nothing but darkness and empty bits...

Then a group came and made a diskmagazine.  The group disappeared, the
diskmagazine idea stayed.  Then there was a long time with again nothing
but another group came. They made a new diskmagazine, and another one, and
another one, and here you see already number 5 of that diskmagazine...

Welcome to the second generation of diskmagazines made by The Disk Busters
Association. Yes you really can say we are a bit proud to present you this
one. We worked very hard on it to give you readers a special thing to wait
for i (Bonus) think we did a good job.

Even before issue 3 was released programming for issue 5 had already star-
ted so this new look has cost us about 4 months to make. And too be honest
we are still working on the magazine, cause it always can better.

But we already see that the kind of menu we are using is now used
in lots of other diskmagzines too. I (bonus)hated the silly pull down
menu a long time, so i made a button menu. But now it's quit common so
i think i wasn't the only one...

There are lot's of people still asking us why aren't the text packed ??
Simple, there are still lot's of people that have mono monitors and the
diskmagazine program only works in low res. But if they still want too
read the text they can just read it on the desktop. And if you would pack
the text they couldn't. But there is some good news for those people, i
will try tyo make a small mono shell so you can read all the articles a
lot easier.

But lots of features have been added or improved as there are:

- A new looking main menu in low res
- Better grafix
- Bigger letters to read on the buttons
- Good looking level and note display for the musics
- Smooth scrolling to picture and text submenu's
- New text displayer, split screen
- Faster and better scrolling
- "Self justifing" auto read mode (" world premiere!!! ")
- Special adjustment for auto read mode
- Better printer options with - Printer Check
                              - Page for page printing option
                              - Complete file printing option
- 4 different fonts
- Over 8 different pictures types possible (future option 10!!)
- Small game
- Hidden article(s)
                      and just some more "small" adds... 

So you see lots of options, not all new or record breaking, but enough
to keep you trying things out. We just hope you like this new diskmagazine
design, and show it to us just by sending in some good articles, interviews
pictures, music's or just anything we can use to make it even better.
And if you have a good idea of an option that isn't included yet, then
send it in and we will see if it is possible and usefull to make.
