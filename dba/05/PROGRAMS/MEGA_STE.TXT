SWITCHER
                      Mega STe processor speed switcher
                      =================================

This program allows you to toggle some of the settings of the Mega STe micro-
processor.
When you run the program, it checks for TOS-version 2.5 or higher and displays
an alertbox if you don't have such a TOS-version.
You can then choose to ignore it, if you do the program will try to load a
value from $ffff8e21, and you'll get 2 bombs.
Right , if all goes well and you use it on a machine it's designed for, a
dialogue-box will appear and display the processor's current status.

That is either:        - 16Mhz, + cache
                       - 16Mhz, no cache
                       - 8Mhz, no cache

You can then toggle these options and exit if you're finished with it.

One more thing, while testing this program, a machine with TOS 1.2 gave
sometimes an incomplete pathname and the resource file couldn't be found by the
program.

This can be solved by placing the program, along with it's resource file in the
root-directory.
