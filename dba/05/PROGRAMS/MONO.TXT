MONO EMULATOR(NEW)


Mono Emulator (new version)

Yep a new mono emulator, well new ???. It's made by Jedi of Sector one
and it's a re_build version of the old mono emulator. This one also
works on 1040 STE's and TOS 1.4. The old one didn't work on some
versions of the 1.4 TOS, but this one seems to work fine.

How to use ???
Just install the program in an auto folder on disk and reboot. A screen
will come up where you can enter the emulation speed from 10 to 90.
After that press return and viola mono is yours. If it works 100%
with all the mono prg's i don't know, cause i can't test them all !!

So i would say, get those mono prg's rolling you always wanted to see
and try it out. Thanx to Jedi for sending in his version of the Mono
emulator.
