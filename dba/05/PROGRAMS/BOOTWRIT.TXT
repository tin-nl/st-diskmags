BOOTWRITE 2.7
                                BOOTWRITE 2.7
                                =============


This is a GEM-based bootsector install program, once installed on one of your
disk, the computer will do this every time you bootup that disk:

                    - Check for possible virusses in memory
                    - See if your available diskspace is less than 100kb
                      and warn you if it is.
                    - You can toggle herz-frequencies by pressing Alternate
                      during bootup.

I've tried to eliminate any bugs but hey, nobody's perfect!
Also, I can not be held responsible for any damage to your disks caused by this
program ( sorry ).
Don't worry, that's not likely to happen.
