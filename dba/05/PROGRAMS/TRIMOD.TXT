TRISOUND CONVERTER


The Tri Sound converter (TriMod v2.1)

Most of you will have seen a sound chip editor called Tri Sound Sequencer.
It's an old editor, good but there  are no up dates made anymore. The
sound it produced was quit good, the first editore ever to use 1
channel for digi sound/samples. It was made by the crew Lynx, but after
a while it was called Insignia. Most people use the Tri Sound still to
make music, but the replay routines are often to complex or not available
and then you have no use for your music. But here is the solution made
by Eagle of Sentry....

Well, finaly here it is. TriMod v2.1, the Fastest Replayer for Digidrums!
Trimod is a utility coded by Eagle of Sentry to make includable music
from a Lynx Trisound Sequencer Song-file and Voiceset (GigaSound v1.0).
To do this you only have to select your song and voiceset and enter the
maximal replayspeed. Trimod does the rest for you.

After the files have been converted, you will be asked to enter a save name.
The produced file can be used like Count Zero music files. This means you
have to put a number in D0 and call the music, put the music's adres plus
six in a vertical blank and the music plays. The end it, you call its
adres plus two and clear the routine from the vertical blank. A source-list
which shows this is in the TRIMOD21 folder.

The replay-routine uses Timer A and is Absolutly the Fastest routine on the
ST! If you don't need your diskdrive while playing the music, it can all be
faster!! You simply put a 1 in D0 at initialisation, but DON'T use any drive
when you do this.

For the ones who already know the program, this version does recognize the
end of a sequence properly and is MUCH faster!
