SMALL RAMDISK

Another ramdisk ????

Well yes, altought it isn't very special. But at the F.O.D. i needed
a small ramdisk to copy some small sources for the diskmagazine but
i forgot my utility disk. So i ask some other people "do you have a
ramdisk program ????". Well nobody seem to have one so i thought it
was wise to get one and put it on the diskmagazine so it wouldn't 
happen to me again in the future.

1) How to use ????

It couldn't be simpler. Just klick the RAMDISC.TTP twice and a message
box will appear on screen. Type in on the line PARAMETER how much Kb
the ramdisk must be as " 50, or 200 " and nothing more. Don't even type
 "K" or something like it, just the number of Kb and the return.
Then a message will appear either:

- RAMDISK TOO SMALL: You have chosen to little Kb too work with. Choose 
                     more Kb's say about 50Kb to start with.
- RAMDISK TOO BIG  : You have chosen to much Kb to work with. Remember
                     you can only use as much Kb as you have ram on board
                     and you will have to leave a bit of ram free for the
                     ST to work with.
- RAMDISK INSTALLED: You now have a ?? Kb large ramdisk to use. Now go to
                     the desktop, klick FLOPPY DISK A on it until it turns
                     black. Now go to OPTIONS and klick on INSTALL DISK
                     DRIVE... Choose DRIVE INDENTIFIER: "D": and klick on
                     INSTALL or press return. Then klick twice on DRIVE D
                     and a window will appear.     

So you see, very easy to use. BUT remember this ramdisk is NOT reset
prove, so save everything to floppy before reseting !!!!
Or else all data and prg's will be lost !!
