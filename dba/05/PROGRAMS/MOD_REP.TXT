MODULE RE-PLAYER

Module Player by TOS CREW

This very special Module Player was send in by Mr. Ni! the TOS crew.
This is the latest version of the program and now it works on an STE
too. This program can play modules but also various kinds of sound chip
music. The program itself and the manual is on the A disk in the folder
MOD_PLAYER. The text is there because we didn't had enough empty disk
space left to put it on the B disk.

Thanx to the TOS crew for sending in this very good player.
