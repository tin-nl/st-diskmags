SOUND CHIP EDITOR !

                      The ultimate sound editor
                 
                      THE MEGATIZER v.2.4 (100% )   
                   ( program by Jedi of Sector One )


Well music freaks this is the moment lot's of people have been
waiting for. The release of a good music editor for that small 
music chip the ST has fitted. And here it is all the way from
France made by Jedi of SECTOR ONE (THK). This is one hell of a
utility for you to make Sound chip music, Digi drum music and 
Two VBL music (new option). 

Lot's of people i heard on party's always said " We want to make 
a demo or a piece of music but we can't cause we don't have a good
sound chip editor". Well now they can't that excuse anymore !!!

This programm should have gone to the shops, but is seems that 
there aren't much publishers intrested these days in good programs
or they pay so low royalties you couldn't buy a good cup of coffie
of it. So Jedi decided to make it shareware, and i think it a very
good idea. 

Okay now to the program itself. It's in the folder called MEGATIZR
, but before you start it you should have ready-->  1 double sided disk
formatted 80 tracks 9 sectors <--. Why, cause this little program will
make for you a special version of the megatizer. A complete disk with 
the program, GFA and ASM sources, samples, patterns, digidrums, player 
and lot's of unreleased music's.

There is only a small but to all this good, the program doesn't work
on Tos version 1.0 and 1.2. We tested it on serveral machines but
it didn't start up. So if you want to use this prg use it with an
new version Tos like 1.4, 1.6, 2.06 or alike...

The rest what you must do you can read in the text that will appear as 
soon as you start he program !!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! AND NOW, if you make a nice piece of music, let us and the rest of  !
! the world enjoy your masterpiece by sending it in. This way we all  !
! can see what a good program it is. And the diskmagazine can spread  !
! some real new and good music's. Maybe this way you will get famous  !
!                                       Don't forget it !!            !
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
I would like Jedi also this way for sending in a massive piece of code
we could give away. Thanks i hope other people will do so in the future
too, so we can get all the power out of the Atari.
