okay?

-- Overview --------------------------------------------------------

This little program will,  to put it straight,  when fed with a  text 
file,  enable you to peek up and down in the file. On colour monitors 
it  uses some pretty undocumented features of your ST to  remove  the 
upper and lower border,  yielding a total of 640x284 pixels (or 80x33 
characters on screen simultaneously).

Version 1.0 of VIEW!.TTP was written for more than 1.5 years ago.  At 
that time,  no one really seemed to take notice of it,  and I  didn't 
bother to do anything more about it.

A few days ago,  though, I got a disk with some new hot warez, and lo 
and  behold,  the guys had actually gone off and used  the  VIEW!.TTP 
program!  Finding that the program did not particularily like my  4MB 
STe  (I wrote it back when I had only 1MB memory...),  I  immediately 
took a peek in the scratch directory,  and yeah!  It was still there, 
screaming  for attention among all the old (unreleased)  demo,  digi-
synth and ProTracker ST sources...

To make a long story (about 2 hours and 34 minutes) short,  you  have 
now  got  VIEW!.TTP  v1.2.  It now works on 4MB  STs  (as  of  v1.1), 
supports monochrome monitors, and has page up & down on [arrow left & 
right]. Enjoy!

O, and BTW, exit w/F10 or [undo] (but you knew that, didn't you?).
