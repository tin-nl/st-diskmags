                   - SOFTWARE TO KILL FOR -
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Well we all have our houses filled with hardware that would be as 
useful  as  an Nintendo if it wasn't for all  the  good  software 
available for it,  be it videos, computers or stereos. We all new 
that  a  Video  2000 was better than a VHS but  has  anyone  seen 
Terminator  on the 2000 system?  What did you  say?  newer  heard 
about  any Video 2000?  well there you see,  no software  =  fast 
death.

So  here follows a list of software that makes it  worthwhile  to 
buy all those black and grey boxes we all love so much. 

(CP  note:  This is only the Cyberpunk films to kill  for,  as  i 
wrote  a bit to much about this bunch of films,  i hadnt time  to 
write about other things.  Next time i'll write a simple top  10) 


                        - VIDEOS (VHS) -  

(The versions mentioned here are original VHS versions,  remember 
that there are something called Laservision,  and in  Laservision 
you  usually  have  2-3 versions that have an  habit  of  getting 
copied over to VHS.  Actually,  a VHS copy taken from Laservision 
is better than an original VHS vid!)
------------------------------------------------------------------

CYBERPUNK VID'S 

1: BLADE RUNNER 

THE  Cyberpunk film,  based on the novel Does droids dream  about    
electric  sheep.  Some Replicants (bio  enginered  droids/humans) 
have killed the crew on a space ship and landed on earth.  An  ex 
Blade Runner (replicant killer) is forced back into duty to  find 
and  kill  them.  

Behind   its   rather  standard  action  plot   lies      complex 
questions,  What is a human,  what is life,  and if you cant tell 
the  difference  between  the man and his machine  are  you  then 
morally  allowed to turn it off.  This is a film you  should  see 
several times as you finds more and more twists and turns in  the 
plot, Is the Blade Runner himself a specially built Replicant?     

Two extra versions exist,  the extended version with more  shoots 
of  the city and its wired population and the new directors  cut. 
Neither is yet out on video.    

NEWS!!! 

After  i  wrote this article i read in NME that Ridely  Scott  is 
filming  NEW scenes and restoring cut scenes from  Blade  Runner, 
this  is  not  the directors cut shown in LA but  a  totally  new 
version.   

2: ROBOCOP 

OCP  (rearrange OCP and you get COP)   wants to  rebuild  Detroit 
but theres one problem,  crime!  The solution is the droid ED-209 
(the  most  adoring creature ever built by  humans!,  anyone  out 
there that wants to start a fan club?  if so then count me as  an 
member)  Unfortunately the cute thing kills one of the OCP  staff 
in a test in the OCP board room!  (in the original Verhoeven  cut 
the ED shoot the man continually for more than a minut!  but  the 
MMPA  didnt  get  the  joke so it was cut down  to  a  couple  of 
seconds  in  all available versions) As the ED  wasnt  the  right 
solution  someone  gets  the bright idea to  put  a  human  brain 
inside  the  metal  to control  the  weapons,  unfortunately  for 
Murphy  he  'volunteers' for the operation in  a  shooting  scene 
(heavily  cut  in most versions) that has one  of  the  sickliest 
jokes in history,  but enough about that.  Murphy is changed into 
tin can (robocop) and then he slowly changes back to Murphy  (but 
he is still a tin can).  The jokes are funny,  the ultra  violent 
is  really ultra (if you have the right version),  the  bad  guys 
are really bad and the good guys are even worse so overall it  is 
a brilliant orgy in blood, oil, guts and screws.
          
There are several versions of this moive out on video,  the least 
cut  should have:  the murphy shooting should be long with  close 
ups  of Murphy as the bullets hits his bulletprof vest,  and  you 
should see the head of the 'Acidwaist man' as it bounces over the 
roof of the car that hits him.  (first movie to have THX sound in 
the movie theatres) 

ROBOCOP II:  not as good as the first one,  has a very bad  intro 
and  an even worse end.  Plot,  badguy kills robo  (nearly)  robo 
kills  badguy (nearly),  badguy becomes  bigrobo,  bigrobo  kills 
badguys,  bigrobo becomes bad, robo kills bad bigrobo.

This  movie  went  direct to video in Norway and  is  the  rawest 
video  to  ever enter Norway legally (totally  uncut)  (the  100. 
movie to have THX sound in the Theatres) 

ROBOCOP  III:  As the second one this is written by Frank  Miller 
(Dark Knight,  Electra,  DD).  This time he have been allowed  to 
take his Ninjas into the plot. Not out yet.


3: AKIRA

A  japanese  animated film based on the 1800  page  Akira  carton 
first  seen  in YOUNG MAGAZINE a  300  page!  weekly!!!  japanese 
carton mag.  The plot diverts some from the carton as even if  it 
is  two  hours long you cant get 1800 pages of  action  into  one 
film.  Neo Tokyo is rebuilding after world war III which  started 
after Akira a powerful telekinetic child 'built' by the  japanese 
government  blasts  Tokyo to bits.  Kaneda leads a gang  of  bike 
punks that in a fight with a rival gang gets mixed up with number 
26  who  are one of the kinetics,  Tetsuo,  one of  Kanedas  gang 
members is seriously injured when he crashes into a force  shield 
conjured  by number 26.  The army appears and takes both  26  and 
Tetsuo to their labs.  Kaneda joins up with Kay,  a member of the 
rebel group that freed number 26,  to free tetsuo.  Tetsuo  dosnt 
seem  to  need  any help as after some experiments  he  grows  so 
powerful  that he easily battles both the other telekinetics  and 
the  labs security forces.  Tetsuo has always been picked  on  by 
others  and  has  quit a score to settle with  the  rest  of  the 
world,  on the top of his list is Kaneda,  but first he wants  to 
prove  that he is the most powerful being alive by killing  Akira 
who the government keeps in coma under the building sigt for  the 
next  olympics.  What  follows  is one of  the  most  spectacular 
battles  ever seen in any film ever made.   

Katsuhiro Otomo's film is spectacular!  This is definitely not  a 
Disney  'sickly cute' animation.  It is violent,  brutal and  for 
most  of  Neo Tokyos population there are no  Hollywoodish  happy 
end.  Two versions out,  one is dubbed to english, the other is a 
letterbox  version with english sub titles and an extra vid  with 
info about the making of Akira and the characters in it.
    

4: ALIEN

Well  Aliens  is the really good one but Alien  cant  exactly  be 
called bad either! 

The  crew of the Nostromo (or something like that) are awaken  by 
their  computer while their flying towards earth with a bus  load 
of minerals,  the computer have picked up unknown signals from  a 
planet  close by (well as close as it gets in  space).  The  crew 
finds  an alien (not the one in the title) ship with a dead  crew 
member,  unfortunately  the thing that killed the alien has  left  
some eggs laying around.   One of the eggs hatches and stage  one 
of  the alien (the one in the title) emerges and the game is  on. 
Not only has the crew the alien to worry about the computer  sets 
the  survival  of the alien higher than the value of  the  entire 
crew! (business you know)

This film has just emerged in an Widescreen (letter box)  version 
that is a must for all fans.


Aliens (Alien II)

Weaver  have spent the last fifty years frozen down in  a  escape 
pod. While she have been enjoying her beauty sleep (does she need 
it?)  the  rest of the human race have made several  smart  moves 
like  colonising the planet where the alien (not the one  in  the 
title)  ship was found,  the ship does still contain  alien  (the 
ones  in the title) eggs.  When the colony suddenly goes  silent, 
Weaver  finds  herself  in  the  unfortunate  (ehh..   fortunate) 
position  of being the only one that have seen an alien (the  one 
in  the title) and survived the encounter.  So she and a gang  of 
rambozoids (space marines) are sent to be breakfast,  ehh  sorry, 
to  investigate.  We all knows what's going to happen  now  don't 
we! 

This  film  exist in many version,  and some of  them  should  be 
avoided at all cost! Lets take the official norwegian version, of 
the  last ten minutes FIVE are cut away!  Dont rent or  buy  this 
version, its more entertaining to look at the wall for two hours! 

Happy  new year boys!!  (and girl) An extended version is on  its 
way over the ocean as we speak,  it contains the the discovery of 
the alien (not the one in the title) ship by the  colonists,  and 
the following battle!  This version is 22 minutes (well some says 
17 minutes) longer than the 'original uncut' version.


Aliens III (or is it Alien III? or Aliens II or maybe Alienses?)   

Weaver  is  back and so are the Aliens (those in the  title  (no, 
i'm  not tired of this joke yet)) It was supposed to be  out  for 
x-mas but it wont be out till summer,  and thats in the bloody US 
of  A.  That  means that we should have it (legally) here  a  bit 
before x-mas (well it did get out till x-mas anyway didnt it)   

5: TERMINATOR

Well  this  is the film that made  Yesigotalotofmusclesegger  the 
most famous actor in US and it made 'Fuck You,  Asshole' the most 
used swearing in the world.  A killer cyborg are transported back 
in  time by a defence network computer that got aware of its  own 
existence,  when  the  army tried to turn it of it did  what  all 
other living beings would do,  it fought back.  After nukeing the 
world  things  looked bright for the machine until  this  bastard 
called John Connor started to train the survivors to fight  back. 
Not  only did they now fight back they were winning!  In  a  last 
attempt  to win,  the computer decides to kill Connor  before  he 
even  is  born  by  sending the mentioned  Cyborg  back  in  time 
through  an  experimental time machine with orders  to  kill  all 
females  with the name Sarah Connor (Johns mother) living in  the 
same town as John grew up in,  To avoid the normal cliche of  one 
man/police-man-discovering-that-there-are-a-killer-robot-from-the 
future-on-the-lose-but-nobody-believes-him  Cameron  decides   to 
let   the  human  creeps captures the time machine  and  sends  a 
soldier back in time to protect Sarah from the Cyborg,  that  way 
you gets a one-man-FROM-THE-FUTURE-knows-that-there-are-a-killer-
robot-from-the-future-on-the-lose-but-nobody-believes-him    much 
more original if you ask me.  That was a long explanation of  the 
plot wasn't it? well guess what! the film hasnt started yet!!!

I  feel  really sorry for the machine here,  the reason  for  the 
humans  to  only  send one soldier back in  time  to  battle  the 
superior cyborg is that they already knows what's going to happen 
so the machines hasn't any chance to win at all.    

This  film has been released and rereleased a couple of times  so 
there  should be several versions out there in video  land,  even 
the Norwegian version  is good so there shouldn't be any risk  in 
renting/lending/copying/stealing this one.

As  all  time travel films this one is  somewhat  unlogical,  but 
nowhere  as  unlogical  as the sequel (being  unlogical  in  time 
travel  is  so  advanced unlogic that most people  cant  see  the 
unlogic in the first place so it aint a big problem,  time travel 
is in itself unlogical so what the f**k) 

Terminator II

Ehh,  of  all the good movies released last year this one is  the 
one  i haven't a VHS copy of yet,  and i havent been in  a  movie 
theatre sins i was in the army, so i havent seen it yet!!! 

But i have read the carton and seen several clips on the telly so 
i  know that the vector graphics are so incredibly good that  you 
cant  do it at home until atari releases their Falcon machine  or 
you  wins a fortune so you can buy an  Next  computer,  ohh,  you 
would also need some extra memory and at least a CD-RAM like  the 
mini disk to save it on.

 
6: HARDWARE

This film was supposed to be a low budget film,  so how come they 
managed to get it this good?  The first thing you notice when you 
turn it on is that it is in LETERBOX,  YES,  YES,  YES, Hurray!!! 
This  film  doesnt have the action of Terminator  or  Robocop  it 
doesnt  have the plot of Blade Runner or Total Recal but what  it 
has  is an incredible style,  no film i have ever seen have  used 
images and sound like this one.  The plot itself is ripped from a 
AD2000 carton,  unfortunately for the director someone at  AD2000 
saw the film,  resulting in a little 'based on' notice  appearing 
at  the  end of the film where darkness had  ruled  supreme.  The 
Plot:  man buys droid head from another man, man gives droid head 
to girl,  girl is an artist,  droid head becomes art,  droid head 
not so impressed and decides to improve it a bit,  man finds  out 
that  the droid is a killer droid designed to kill all humans  it 
encounters  (nice attitude),  the fun begins,  ehh,  the fun  had 
already  begun but what the f***.  The thing that sets  this  and 
Akira apart from the rest of this bunch of films is that it  aint 
made in Hollywood, it aint even made in the US of A but in the oh 
so Grate Britain (G. B. or Giga Bytes among friends) so what does 
that mean then?  well it usually means it sick,  wired,  contains 
nudity,  vague  characters  (not  just good  and  evil),  and  is 
mainly  unpredictable.   After  the  first  five  seconds  of  an 
Hollywood film you usually knows who's gona die and how they gona 
get killed,  how it will end and so on,  most of them should have 
the  message  'Pleas disconnect your brain before  watching  this 
film' at the beginning of the intro.            

There  are several versions of this film,  unfortunately  i  have 
only seen the norwegian one, and it was cut here and there. If it 
had  gone  direct  to video it would  have  been  uncut,  so  its 
sometimes  best to get them that way,  especially if you goes  to 
the theater as rarely as i do.
 
7: TOTAL RECALL 

There's one fault with this film,  it has a bit to much action in 
some  scenes.  It  even  has one of those stupid  'loads  of  men 
standing  in  a circle shooting into the middle  without  hitting 
eachoter'  that  scene  nearly  destroyed  the  film,  when  your 
watching  a  Verhoeven  movie you dont  expect  stupid  'Maid  in 
taiwan' scenes like this one. Musclegger plays the lead with some 
playmates  jumping around playing cool 'n' hard ladies.  Its  the 
plot that makes this movie a gem (no it aint a operating system), 
so then to the plot....  Quaid (schwarzy boy) plays a road worker 
(what about the droids,  isnt this taking their jobs) that dreams 
about living on mars,  and sins he lives in 2084 that aint a  big 
problem,  but  his wife hates mars.  (what about a  divorce?)  So 
instead  he goes to Recall inc.  to buy some memories of  a  mars 
trip,  not just a ordinary trip,  he 'goes' as an special  agent. 
unfortunately for him (not for us) something goes wrong!  oh,boy 
Lobocop next?  and the fun begins.  The good thing with this film 
is that the first time you sees it you never have a clue if  what 
you sees is real or just a dream/memory.  Unfortunately Verhoeven 
has  chosen to reveal to much so you knows what it is the  second 
(or if your stupid the third or fourth) time you watch the  film, 
well  the  film  is targeted at the american  marked  and  they'r 
somewhat ehh,.. lets be nice to them, lets just say that they are 
less  intelligent,  so americans will probably have more fun  the 
tenth time they watch it than we will (well sweeds will  probably 
have  to  see it a couple of hundred times before they  gets  it, 
welcome to 'Norway VS Sweeden joke war part II').

As  the  norwegian  version is uncut i havent  looked  for  other 
versions (well i have the english one and the only difference  is 
that the norwegian sub titles are gone),  but there are  probably 
other cut versions out there like the sweedish one where all  the 
killing is cut away,  running time on that version is 1 minute  + 
credits.  Wow  what a prog.they are showing on the  telly, 'Happy 
songs from Lund church' please wait while i puke..... 

Well  then  finally  finished,   i  had  planed  to  write   this 
detalidofauoijxjkhbnk f*** f*** i have written so much  norwegian 
the last days that it really f*** up my english.  Then we  starts 
again. I had planed to write about all the films like i have done 
with  these CP films but it would have taken me ages to  get  the 
time  to  do it and it would have taken up to much space  in  the 
mag. (the last one there is probably the worst excuse i have ever 
come up with) 

See ya mon....

C.P. signs of again.......... 

Ohh no, a african girl just started singing and african christian 
song...  I think i better go and get my vid back from the  living 
room  (rented 'Sometimes they comes back',  and the somewhat  old 
'The  pit and the pendulum' last night,  so i moved my  vid  into 
the living room to copy them)      

If you wonders why i openly says that i copies vid's its  because 
you can legally copy anything here in norway as long as it is for 
private use,  but i also have loads of original vids that i  have 
bought legally the last months........

P.S. If you have to copy vid's then do it through the audio/video 
ports (scart) and not through the RF-tv ports.

I'll send this text down to DBA tomorrow (17.  march 1992) so the 
real  Software to kill for will not appear until next issue as  i 
havent  written it yet,  it will also contain the worst  software 
ever given out.
