A DAY AT SCHOOL


A normal day at school

Every day I get up at 7:00 drink some tea, and wait for my 
friend and we go to school.

The first hour of the day I take a nap. The second hour I take a
nap. The third hour I wake up, and listen to the sucker in front
of the class. Make a nice drawing of him and than I take a nap 
again. The fourth hour we are getting bored. So we start to throw
pencils to the sucker who is getting a realy weird colour. And 
is having some difficulties with his health. (Who cares, he 
should have learned a real proffession.)

When he gets mad (or should I say: red-hot-steeming-blue-pink-
purple-yellow). He asks:"Do I have to get mad?" Hey if that makes 
you happy get mad. (Does anyone know the phone number of his 
shrink?)

When we must go to the next lesson he barks like a dog, stands 
on his chair, and is taken a pee in the ashtray on his desk.
(Do you think we have upset him a bit? Naaah why should he be?)

The fifth hour I'm really tired so I go to sleep. The sixth hour
we have a chewing-gum fight. After I while that isn't so much
fun anymore, so we start a book-fight. 

How to have a real nice book-fight:

First of all get a book out of your back. Blow the dust of,
(some of you might have seen something like it on T.V.) aim
at the dork in front of the class lift your book up, and 
throw as hard as you can. 

If your schoolbag is really rusty, and you can't get it open,
use your whole bag, it won't make a difference. 

And after an hard days work at school, we think contented about 
our nice succesfully-well-used day at school. 

Goodbye for now,

Miss A.S. (NOT ASE!!)
