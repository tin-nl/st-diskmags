DEREK.PRG
---------

This is a small demo made of a module file. It was send in
by Cyclone of Quartex. But putting a MOD file on disk seems
a bit poor so with at the D.B.A. made a little demo of it.
Just take a look at it !...

F.O.D.PRG
---------

This is another small demo send in by Flames of Diamonds. 
Thanx for sending it in quys and keep it up.

PARTY.PRG
---------

Here is a special one !!!! Its an invitation for a big party that
will be held in Oslo in August. It was send in by Delta Force\Imagina
to be spread all over the world. But this small program works only
good if it is in the AUTO folder. So if you want to see it proper,
copy the folder to a new disk and rename the folder to AUTO. I don't
know if every TOS version can so i suggest you make an AUTO folder and
copy PARTY.PRG in it and then reboot...

TOS_CREW.PRG
------------

This is an older demo you might have seen before. Mr. Ni! gave it to
us at the F.O.D. party to re-release. It's a good demo completly made
in Omikron basic so get a good look at it.

                                        That's all, keep sending in
                                        intro's and small demo's...

                                         Bonus Software

P.s. we can't promise that we will put them on the first issue to
come. If there is enough room we will place it, if not we will try to
release it on the next issue...
