Yep another small scene info for you send in by Jedi of 
Sector One. They have a new member, called MEERCLAW.

It should be a good group member again.

And then another special about The Heavy Killers (THK). The old THK
as probably may of you know it doesn't exist anymore. It contained 
lot's of non active groups and Jedi of Sector One is making a new 
start with other groups under the same name again. This way he
hopes the THK will get a better name and reputation. Only good active
groups can join in this new alliance. Hope it will succeed ...

And JEFF, another good GFA programmer was asked to join the
new T.H.K. but saidly enough he said no. Why, cause as he says 
himself "I am to lazy to enter in a group". But he made a 
guest screen for the Bee Forol demo also so that lazy he
can't be and if it is as good as his screen in the Kidney
Bean demo you beter look out for it...
