It depend of the demo. Some are really crap, shitty, tiny, not too original

They are just like the demos in general. Some are BIG Lamers and some are 
really good.

Original things because all "little" demos now are all the same as a scroll
text,a logo, a music and another simple effect already known.

I like the intros compils. Not only because I do it too but also because you

Atari corp is a good company but they don't go fast enough and don't give very
much infos about their computers.

Many games are really bad because made by coders who don't know how to code or
simply convert the amiga game. But some are very good in fact.

I have no opinion about this.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Of course but I will only buy the very good ones like now.
