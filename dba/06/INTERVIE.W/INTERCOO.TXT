1.  Tell us something about the place you live in ( Burea ).

The place or the spot were I live in is a very small town with about
3000 inhabitens. There is no action there, well okay once a year we
have a special day thats called Žlvens dag "Rivers day" and everybody
meets everybody and have fun. Women like that day a lot, I think its
because of all the gossip and so on.

2.  What famous person do you like to be for just one day?
    ( a movie-star or another kind of person ).

Tough one, that one!!! Hmmmmmmm well lets see.... God I think, why? Then
I could see to that all evil in the world would be extinct!! And that
all wars would stop and I would destroy all the weapons in the world.
I would do this in six minutes and then take the rest of the day off.

3.  How long do you have your STe? 

Since the 20 of August 1988. Ill bought it around noon that day. It
was the happiest day of my 80s.

4.  What do you think about the new Falcon computer? Do you want to
    buy one or not?

Well if everything they say about it is true. YES YES YES I MUST HAVE
ONE!!!!! 

5.  What is your favourite country in Europe? ( except for Sweden ).

That was a leading question!!! You know that I now that you will be angry
with me if I wont tell you that my favourite land in Europe it the little
sweet country of the Netherlands. Yes I meen it "I'll think so anyway".

6.  What is the best dream you have ever had? And what are the most stupid
    words you have ever heard?

My best dream were that I was living with my love of my life in a 
beautiful house with our two children and that we were the happiest
people in the whole wide world. The worst I have ever heard were what
this little stupid girl called me when I didn't want to go out with 
her. If the everybody in the world were so meen as you we wouldn't have
a world to live in!! Talk about an insult eeeehhh!

7.  What's the most interesting article you have read in last D.B.A.
    magazine and why?

Thats a tricky one!!!! I can't say thats there is any special articele
really but I like the whole concept of the magazine.

8.  What do you want to do when you have 5 million dollars?

Buy an Falcon, Put the rest of the money in a bank and live the rest
of my life on the rent I'll get from the bank.

9.  Which pet do you like to have when you get your own appartment?
    ( a dog, a cat, a bird, or may be a fish like Ms. Angie has ? )

A cat of course. They are smart and independant.And like myself they don't
do anything that they don't wanna do!

10. What do think about the future of the ST scene and the D.B.A. ?

Ill hope that Atari would survive into the 21 centuary and the same
with the D.B.A. I think that both have a tough future but if you dont
give in they mite just survive.

11. Do you like to say something to the other members of D.B.A.?

Well guys I have told you once and I will tell you again! You are a
bunch of good guys "and girl" and I ll hope that youe future will
be as bright as our lakes here in the nothen parts of Sweden.
Mr Cool signing off. Take care of the world that we live in its
our and our childrens future.
