It varies from day to day...

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
good, but too much of them are all the same and ripped. When someone gets the
good idea of ripping an amiga idea, you see 50 screens using this idea.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
I don't knoz how they can write so long texts knowing that nobody will read!

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
I don't know but all new styles of games (such as AM's Invertix boot) are  
welcome.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explane your answer...           (3 LINES)
I liked them at first but now, you can fill up a demo-CD with demo-CD menus,
that's why I (almost) never copy them !!!!

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
I don't care. The only important thing for me is that they make cheap hardware.

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
Yes in general, but sometimes the games are lame transcoding of the PC-EGA, 
or no special technique is used and You get 100-VBL games with ugly sound.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
Fuck the crackers. They make games become lame and the ST become an Amiga.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Yes, but anyway I'm never interested in most of the games.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
TILT (motherfuckers but I like read it anyway)                               
ST-mag (the best of the best, You can ask nothing more from a computer mag)

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
TILT contents nice tests on games (ST, Ami** and PC), nice previews,...      
ST-mag contents all actuality, a great disk-mag, ...

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
I'd tell more about demo's, since it's my only center of interest in the ST. 

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Yes, because you get nice softs, little games, useful utilities, nice previews 
                                                                            
Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes, but It'd be better if it was less of them. Because else we'll get 359 
different magazines in the future and we won't know which to read and which 
to erase.I think idea of magazines will follow the idea of demo-CDs.
Do 
you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
I hate craptalk. I like the articles that tell about a demo-party, interviews
or tell about hardware, demos, games tips... I never read shitty crap such as
jokes, pretending tips, how to become a lamer, ...

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
I don't know. I format a magazine when it'sn't good enough.

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
Asking that kind of question instead of making interesting articles.

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
Someone who makes 3 demo-CD with 8-months old intros and intros with 
distorting logo, 8X8 1-plane scroll, Whittaker Musaex and equalizer, with a 
scroll in spanish and a small bip when you press space.

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
They are necessary else who would like lame demo CD's with 8-months old intros
and an intro with distorting logo, 8X8 1-plane scroll, whittaker musaex and 
equalizer, spanish text and a small bip when you press space ??

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Learn assembler with a friend who can code. Going to demo parties. Copy demos 
on their 658 disks filled up with crap games. Erasing spanish demos-CD with 
8-months old intros.

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
My father bought a small 520ST at Christmas 1987. I was amazed that when You
move the mouse, a small arrow followed its trajectory !!!! What a new techno-
logy !!! But at Christmas 1990 I bought a 1040 STE.
