                         THIS ISSUE IS DEDICATED TO,

Cyberpunk of the Network,

You really deserve this because you have written lots of articles for our
magazine in several issue's, starting from issue 2 on !
You've also send us lots of cool pictures, we really appreciate it.
I really hope that you keep writing for us, although there are rumours
that you might quit on us, anyway you did good work !!!
Thanks a lot mon.........

I also would like to mention; Sandman from Flash for his contributions !
We really hope that you continue writing articles for us.

Further i would like to mention Richard Karsmakers for his good work
on ST NEWS which is still one of my favourite magazine's on the ST.
We will never beat your brilliant articles and i think that no other 
magazine ever will.
You inspired us and lots of other magazine teams with the making of the
magazine.
I hope that you be a bit quicker with your answers next time !

There are also more people that decided to write for us, i hope that you
all stay with us and don't wonder off to some other magazine.
We like people that support us on a perpanent basis !!!!

Okay enough of this bottom licking stuff, go and read the rest of our
magazine.
