Howdy people it's time for some book reviews again. This time I'm going to
concentrate on the author called Douglas N. Adams. He was born in Cambridge
in 1952. He was educated at Brentwood School, Essex and St John's College,
Cambridge where he read English. After education he spent several years
contributing material to radio and television shows as well as writing, 
performing and sometimes directing stage revues in London, Cambridge and
on the Edinburgh Fringe. He has also worked at various times as a hospital
porter, barn builder, chicken shed cleaner, bodyguard, radio producer and
script editor of Doctor Who. He is not married, has no children, and does
not live in Surrey.
