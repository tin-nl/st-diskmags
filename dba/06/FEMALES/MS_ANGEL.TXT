1.      The name ' Linda' is the most favourite name for a girl in the 
        province Groningen, the Netherlands. This is the conclusion of
        a population research of the GGD in east of Groningen. So this
        name it is the most popular name at the moment. At second  and
        third place: Jolanda and Miranda.
         
2.      The name 'Marcel' is the most favourite name for a guy. At second

3.      A Super pigeon from the Netherlands flew 'bussiness class" and
        drove in a Rolls Royce from Schiphol to London-Gatwick. The
        pigeon " Invincible Spirit" got in the aircraft a special meal.
        With a Rolls Royce they brought him to his new owner. The old
        owner and the new owner went to Guiness Book of Record to
        announce the pigeon for the highest record purchase money. 
        

 4.     Pregnant women who do not wear safety belts in the car have with
        an accident 33% more chance of dying then pregnant women who
        wears this safety belts. Of unborn baby's it's 47% !!! Wear
        safety belts it is yet 5% of the pregnant women who died owing to
        the car accident and always yet 11% of the unborn baby. This 
        conclusion comes from The Britisch Medical Journal.
        The best manner for wearing the safety belts for a pregant
        women is:

        * shoulderstrap: between breast and above along the belly
        * hipstrap     : beneath along the belly
        
        Only on this manner the baby sits safe in womb uterus! 

 5.     Everyone knows it is not good for your teeth to suck your thumb
        but what is the conclusion of a the Medical magazine "The Lancet"
        from America? Only "big peoples" teeth have influence for the
        stand of your teeth for your whole live.
         
 6.     For the first time there is organized a holiday camp for 
        young people with burn wounds in Nunspeet, the Netherlands.
        for one week. They had talks and lessons in visagist.
        P. Lutgens (24), a patient (have had 55 operations!):
        " The way of a burn patient is very long and difficult, but
        with many trust and perseverance there is hope for them. You
        must be positive in your attitude. Your inner is more important
        then your look".
        Teenagers thinks now i can not have a relation or they will have
        a live in retirement. Patients do not swim, ride horse,
        barbeque or something like that anymore.
        On this camp a lot of patients went for swimming after long time
        again. For losing their fear they have had a big camp fire with
        many pleasure and socialibility. They can think positive about
        fire on this manner now. 
        Next year they hope they can organize another camp again but
        one for adults too because it is very successful.

  **********           CRIME   PASSIONNEL         ************

===========================================================================


          
        One of the five murders in the Netherlands is perpetrate in love-
        relations. You can read in newspaper many times: student does
        a murder attempted of love, husband suspected of murder of his women.
        Lover shoots lover rival death. " Crime Passionnel" is very old. 
        The other partner can not accept when his partner will have 
        more freedom. Then he of she is jealous. He thinks the other
        is a continuation of himself and that is wrong. It can happen
        that the plugs blown then. The kernel of the problem is: fear for
        abbandon. It is a crime that everyone can do, poor or rich.
        When you have a relation you must not be dependent on the other.
        You must do things for your own and for example you must know
        how to fill up a giro transfer form. You must can take distance
        of eachother for knowing the other partner a lot more. You must
        not carp up your lover always. Most awnful thing is when the 
        other thinks my friend has another lover. The grass is on other
        side always greener than your side. That is the problem.
