MACHINE GUN !

How to loose stress !!

Did a program just crash your hard drive? Have all your files just been
erased by a virus ? Or are you just really pissed off by someone ?
It seems all is lost, but wait! You can take revenge!

MACHINE GUN - The desk accesory made to kill.

Just shoot at every thing on the desktop and get a really good feeling
doing it. Load down your stress feeling as you blow away the TRASHCAN,
your harddisk icon.

If you use these routine more then twice a day i recommend you should see
a doctor or give your Atari into repair.
