USING LHARC.TTP


Or just how to unpack those LZH files...

This isn't going to be a large lessons of how to use LHARC.TTP. Noway
just a brief instruction lesson.
On disk A and B the are some files with the extention.LZH. This means
that the files are packed with an utility called LHARC.TTP. It one of
the best packing methodes with one minor setback. All the files are
packed in one large file that you can't start right away. You will 
have to unpack it first...

How to do it.
-------------

Just copy the program LHARC.TTP and the .LZH file you want to unpack
on an empty floppy. Double klick on the LHARC.TTP and you will get a
dialog box. just type "e *.LZH" and enter. The e stand for extract and
the * is just the name like LISTINGS.LZH. After you have don this the
program will start unpackinmg ("Melting" as they call it) and you will 
get the unpacked files on that disk.

There are a lot more options and you can display them by double klick
on LHARC.TTP and when you get the dialog box just press return, don't fill
in anything. This way LHARC will show it's own HELP display with all the
options it has...

Hope that this is any help for you so you can use the listings and prg's
that are on the disks...
If there are still any questions just write and we will help you...
