                             THESAURUS,

This utility is a sort of synonym desktop program.
When you click on the program, you get a box with the message " ENTER
KEYWORD " on your screen.
When you enter a word, like for instance " END " you will get a list
of words that can be used with the word " END ".

Example: END

Answer: Aftermath    Product   Outcome 
        Conclusion   Reaction  Upshot

This is really nice to use as a desktop program while you work with your
Word-processor or something like that.

I would like to thank; Paul Holst for sending this utility to me.
Put it to good use............
