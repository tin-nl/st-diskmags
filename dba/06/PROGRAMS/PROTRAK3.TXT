PRO-REPLAY 2.0

The new and best replayer sofar...

Yes another module replayer was send in, this one is made by JEDI of
Sector one (THK). It is a new version of the old Replay of Electric 
Images. This one really sounds a lot better then the older one, supports
the STE even better and has some new features added. SPECIAL EFFECTS
is a special one indeed, just try it out. You might not hear it at
first but when you play the same module with NORMAL EFFECTS afterwards
you might think that something is missing...

There is also another player in the folder. It is an older version of
a player Jedi made some time ago. For some reason some modules seem to
sound even better with an older routine. Just check it out and find it out
for yourself...

Well what more can I tell, only that some groups use the older version
on there module compil disks. Just let me tell you this, get rid of the
old version and use this one, it sounds a lot better, can play modules
other players can't and has some nices approvments. And don't forget
to mention where you got it from !!!!!!!

I want to thank Jedi for sending this new and very good player and hope 
you will send even better ones in the future...

So, why are you still reading, get to it and try it out....
