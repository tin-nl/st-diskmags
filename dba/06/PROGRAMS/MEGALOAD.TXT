MEGATIZER PATCH


Megatizer v2.4 Loader for TOS v1.2 owners !!
--------------------------------------------

A Quickly Knocked-Up Program by MUG U.K¿ (of The Source)


After you have un-archived 'Megatizer v2.4' from DBA Disk Magazine 5,
copy this little program onto your disk.  Double-click on it and  
'Megatizer v2.4' loads on TOS v1.2 !!  

Now everyone can be users of this excellent music editor.  The problem
(I assume) is with the intro because using this loader, the intro is
ignored and the music editor works 100% !!

So now everyone can make sweet music so long as it is NOT house music !!
And don't forget to add lots of heavy digi-drums !!


See you later
