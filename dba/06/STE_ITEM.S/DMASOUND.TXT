When you've read my article in DBA magazine 5 you already know 
that I own an Atari MegaSTe. It was one of my fondest wishes to 
play Replay 4 samples trough the DMA soundchip with an Omikron 
Basic program. I did not know how to accomplish this so I asked 
some people how to do it. They told me that is was dead easy but 
nobody could tell me exactly how it was done. Luckily there was an 
article in DBA magazine 4 which explained all about the DMA chip's 
addresses and the sampleformat so I only had to solve two problems; 
how to make the program in Omikron Basic and how to convert the 
samples.

CONVERTING THE SAMPLES:

The DMA soundchip is able of playing stereo samples at a sample rate 
of 6.25, 12.5, 25.0 or 50.0 KHz. To make it do it's work you need 
to put the sample data in a special format (called a frame) into 
memory. This frame consists of two different signed (-128 to 127) 
samples, one for the left and one for the right channel. The upper 
byte of the first word of the frame is the sample for the left 
channel. The lower byte of the first word of the frame is the sample 
for the right channel.

The problem with Replay 4 is that it uses an unsigned (0 to 255) 
sample format, that it does not support stereo sound and that the 
only DMA compatible sample rate is 50 KHz.
To get a stereo sample you need to sample the same sound twice, the 
first time connect the Replay 4 cartridge to the left output of a 
audiosource and the second time to the right output. Use the Replay 
4 editor to get the timing of the two samples right and equal them 
in length.
To convert an unsigned sample to a signed sample you need to 
subtract 128 for each value higher than 127 and add 128 to every 
value less than 128.
A 50 KHz sample sounds great but it also needs a lot of memory so 
it's better to use a sample rate like 25 KHz. Replay does not support 
25 KHz and to prevent the sample from playing too slow or too fast 
you can use a 50 KHz sample and convert it to 25 KHz. This is done by 
adding every 2 bytes and devide them by 2. The 25 KHz sample you 
get this way often sounds better than a sample sampled directly at 
25 KHz!

If this is all abracadabra to you then the Omikron Basic program 
CONVERT.BAS that is included on this disk was made especially for 
you. First compile it using the Omikron Basic Compiler, be sure you 
have 2 samples of the same length named LEFT.SPL and RIGHT.SPL in 
the root directory of your drive and then run the program. A time 
bar on your screen will tell you when conversion is ready after 
which the DMA frame STEREO.FRM will be written to the disk.

PLAYING THE SAMPLE:

Playing a DMA frame is simple, you have to tell the DMA chip were 
the frame starts, where it ends, what playback rate it should play 
the frame and finally if it has to play the frame once or in al 
loop.

The start and end addresses have to be split up in a low, a middle 
and a high byte. Selecting the sample rate is done by poking a 
value into address $FF8920

0 = 6.25 KHz
1 = 12.5 KHz
2 = 25.0 KHz
3 = 50.0 KHz

Address $FF8900 is used to initialize the DMA chip

0 = Stop playing
1 = Play once
3 = Play loop

It can all be done with the Omikron Basic program PLAYDMA.BAS. 
Compile it with the Omikron Compiler, be sure you have a frame 
named STEREO.FRM in the root directory and execute the program. 
Running the Basic version of PLAYDMA.BAS or using the EXEC *.PRG 
option of the Omikron Basic editor will result in a screen black-
out so run PLAYDMA.PRG from the desktop only!
Use a compiled version of the STOPDMA.BAS program to stop it all.

You will notice that during DMA playback it is possible to run other 
programs from the desktop without losing any valuable processor 
time. Actually DMA playback uses no processor time at all!

I did not test the software on any other computer than on my own 
MEGA STe but I think it will work on the 1040STe, TT or even on the 
FALCON without any problem. The Omikron Basic program can easily be 
converted to GFA Basic or any other Basic dialect.

If there is anybody out there who knows a better way to play DMA 
sound, how to set the volume, balance and tone of the DMA soundchip 
or how to make use of hardware scrolling on the STe with Omikron 
Basic then please write to DBA magazine!!!
