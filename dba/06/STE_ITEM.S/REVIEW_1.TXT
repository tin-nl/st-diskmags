POWER RISE DEMO

                          Power Rise by Light
                          -------------------

POWER RISE is a new megademo for Atari STE. It was made by one of the
leading STE-groups: LIGHT. In this review I'm not trying to tell you
screen by screen what the demo looks, but I will tell you what is my
opinion about it.

This demo doesn't have an introduction. Only a screen where is the 
POWER RISE-logo and some other text shows you, where you have just
entered.

After loading the menu appears. You control a man, who can walk left
and right. When you see the door, you press space, and POF, you enter
the screen. This kind of menu is nothing unusual, but LIGHT has done
it quite a well.

All the screens are designed well, but I can't understand why they 
put the ST screen in this demo. Of course the coder (MEGA TRI) owns
STFM, but it is not good enough for an explanation.

Ideas are not original (bobs, vector dots, disting logos, etc.), but
who really cares about originality in these days. The one thing I 
didn't like was that the most of the musics were ripped from Amiga.

There were also one guest screen made by XTREME D-SIGN. This group is
not only working on STE but also on Amiga. Their screen is nice to
watch (it's unlimited bobs!), but again it's not original.

All in all this demo is good to be in your collections, and all the
STE fans will surely enjoy it for a long time!

Code:        75/100
Graphics:    80/100
Music:       65/100  (Could be 80, but too much ripping)
