Yo! It's SANDMAN from FLASH once again writing this corner for Atari
STE. This time all I have written is only one little review. This is
not very much and so I've decided that this is my last STE-corner.

I won't stop writing for D.B.A. (of course if they force me to...),
because that is not the problem. D.B.A. has always been very positive
for my articles, and I have only good experiences from them. The real
reason why I'm giving up with this corner is that no-one helps me.
I can't write interesting news or other things, when nobody sends me
good stuff.

Well, I thought it is fair to give you people the last chance to help
me to continue with this corner. If I'll get 5-10 hot news, and some
new demos, I can consider of doing another STE-corner. Otherwise this
is the last one.

If you have liked (aren't you strange?) the way how I write, you can
still enjoy my stories in this same wonderful magazine, but I will
tell you all kind of stories instead of this corner (I may even write
about STE too).
