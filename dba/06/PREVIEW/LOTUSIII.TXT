LOTUS III

Lotus III, the final challenge,

That all good things are always three is a well known fact. At Gremlins
they probably thought the same thing. Although i liked Lotus I very
much i didn't play Lotus II much. I had no challenge in it at all. I
mean you could almost let the stick where it was and do nothing and
the game would play for you. But okay, Lotus III will not be some
cheap rip off of Lotus II with just some new tracks in it...

In LOtus III there are a lot of new things, the most usefull(????)
new thing is the awfull green new Lotus M200. No the most eyecatching
new thing is the trackeditor, that sets a new standard. It will be
able to adjust the difficulty, number of kurves, the number of climbing
percentage and track length. This way you could make billions of 
differnt tracks to play. 

Other new things are: Five new screnery's
                      64 new build in tracks
                      New sound and music effects
                      New modes (like time limits, continue if you are
                                 in the top ten...)
                      Side wind effects (!)

It almost speaks for it self that Lotus III will be faster the the older
Lotus versions we have had sofar. As soon as we have it here we will test
all this and see what of it is really true...
