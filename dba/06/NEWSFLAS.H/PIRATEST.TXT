TROUBLE'S

                             TROUBLE'S,

F.A.S.T. have been very active the last couple of months with busting
crackers and P.D. Library's( especially in the U.K. ).
Some of those P.D. library's where good contacts of us, so i'm really
pissed off by what happend to them !
Nobody realised that demo's with sampled music and movie pictures where
illigal.
I don't see what artist's and movie makers loose in their income when
people watch these demo's !
It could even be positive because people could get curious about those 
pictures and hire the movie at the local video-shop !
Those demo's don't even have the quality of the original sound/pictures.
NOBODY gets hurt by making these demo's( even a child could see that ) !

I think that those F.A.R.T. people can not catch the real crackers and then
they go pick on those P.D. library's !
Sneaky campaigns, busting P.D. libby's, bribing people and fake adverts in
certain magazine's !
I could easely catch most pirates without all those dumb campaigns.

Go and bust pirates like real men and not as a bunch of lamers !

                              SLIMER ......
