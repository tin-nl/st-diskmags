R.I.P. IS  R.I.P.

ROYAL INSTANT PUDDING IS R.I.P.

I guess you don't understand it anymore what all this means, so i will
have some explaining to do. R.I.P. stands for a group called Royal Instant
Pudding, but i think i could better say stood for it. Why stood ????
Well R.I.P. is no more !!!!! Yep another small group that has given up.
No thats not completly true, they have joined another bigger group. To be
more specific they have joined up with: HEMOROIDS.

So from now on R.I.P. is called Hemoroids Iceland. I spoke with DURI-17
(in former R.I.P. better known as Phygorax) at the Messe why they went
to Hemoroids. He told me that the group was lossing intrest and had some
members that didn't do anything anymore. So they gave up R.I.P. and joined
Hemoroids. The HMD Iceland now has 3 members and we hope we will hear from
them again soon...

Thats all for this time...
