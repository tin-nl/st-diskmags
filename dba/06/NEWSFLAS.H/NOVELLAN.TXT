                          NOVELL NETWORK CRACKING

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There seems to be a "leak" in the old Novell network program !
Some articles about this "leak" are already printed by certain magazine's
like Hack-Tic and a Dutch Atari magazine !
Novell has already solved the "leak" by releasing a new version( 3.11 ) of  
the program, but many firm's are still using the old system !

I have treid to hack myself into the system at my work, but i failed and
blocked the main-computer by doing this !
They warned me not to do this stuff anymore without their permission.
The female Sysop has warned me and said that she knew enough of the
system to believe that it is 100 % proof !!(ha ha ha ).

Well, you are probably waiting for the access code now, okay here goes,

You must type " SUPERVISOR " when the system ask's your name.
Then you must give a simple " RETURN " when the system want's the access
code( if you can generate the return with a program, you will have faster
access to the Supervisor mode ).
Repeat the " RETURN " till you get access( it only works on the old system ).

P.S. We don't take any responsiblity if things go wrong !
