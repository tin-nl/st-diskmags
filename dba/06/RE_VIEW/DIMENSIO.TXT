Finally we recieved a new mega demo from Finland by Condemned.
This little megademo was released on the S.U.C.C. party, but you can read
all about that in another article in this magazine.
We where the first foreign group to recieve this demo and we really like to
thank Condemned for that !
I like to show our gratitude by reviewing this demo in this magazine.

**************************** TAKING OFF ...... *****************************

This is going to be a real drag: lets put the disk in the drive and boot
the whole stuff.......
Camera's ready ?? Action !!

Somekind of a logo appears on my screen and it says: Dimensio.
My diskdrive continues with loading and after some seconds an intro picture
appears on the screen accompanied by module music.
The picture says: Condemned presents Dimensio.
After some time i decided that i probably have to press space to see some
more action.

Yep i was right, there are caracters popping up with an exploding sound.
Those caracters are forming words for me to read, some of the usual talk
fly's by and the info. screen ends itself.

****************************** THE MAIN-MENU ********************************

After some more loading, the main-menu of the demo appears on the screen.
It looks like the Punisch Your Machine main-menu were you can choose out
of pictures representing a demoscreen.
To scroll through these pictures you must use the arrow keys up and down
and the return key to load the screen.
The pictures bounce up and down and in top of the screen is a ( i think )
32*32 scrolltext.
In this main-menu is also some nice chippy musax to make it all complete.

Everytime that you press the return to load a screen the credits appear
telling you who coded, drawed, ripped, invented or designed the screen.

******************************** Screen 1 **********************************

Name: A kilo of iron or a kilo of feathers.

That's a real heavy question and to be honest i don't have a clue.
But i was never smartest on school anyway, so it's beyond my I.Q. !

The screens begins with a big scrolline in the middle and two logo's in the
upperpart of the screen.
Those two logo's have some background graphics and then there is the big
Condemned logo in the lower border.

Nothing fancy here, but then things begins to move.......

Rastercolors appear behind the big scroller and ZZ-Top begins to play....
Eerrmmhh I mean ZZ-Top on the radio, lets keep it with chipmusic.
The big scroller does some horizontal shrinking and the opposite of shrinking
while moving by.
That big logo in the border i told you about is now distorting and those
background graphics behind the upper two logo's are sliding left and right.
One of those two upper logo's says; Condemned and it slides also from the
left to the right.
Between those two logo's and background graphics is a little scrolltext with
some greetings flying by.

The screen returns after a while to the main-menu.
Not a bad screen, good code and very good chipmusic by Crawdaddy of
Chronicle, a very good screen. 

********************************** Screen 2 *********************************

Name: The Ice Paradice.

The whole picture in the screen is sliding up and down and it makes me sick.
In that picture is scrolling message and level indicators.
But i get really sick from those three big sprites that move on the screen.
Those sprites spell C.E.D. and are drawn in boxes, to make the mess complete
there is a option to choose between two different music's with the 1/2 keys.

All the graphics are filled with different kinds of blue, this gives you
that ice cold feelin'.
Another good demoscreen with moody chipmusic from Mad Max.

******************************** THE NEXT ONE *******************************

Name: The slow Ones Win the Fast Ones.

This screen is very hard to explain but i give it a try.
There are two vertical textlines on the left and right side of the screen.
I say textlines because it are not scrollines, good, those two textlines
begin a countdown by showing 5,4,3,2,1.... and that sort of stuff.

And than the brown stuff hits the fan because a big logo ( CED ) bounces
up and down in the middle of the room , eermm screen.
Underneath that logo are some level indicators.
Okay now comes the hard stuff, there are vertical words appearing on the
screen on the two sides of the CED logo.
I had to put my monitor on his right side to read the moving text that moves
by using a distortion technique.

Still with me, good this is one of those screens you have to see yourself
to fully understand what i mean.
The good chipmusic in this demoscreen again is by Crawdaddy of Chronicle.
Those Finnish guys did a good job on this one.......

******************************** Screen 4 ***********************************

Name: A window behind the Universe ( deep stuff ).

We begin from the top of the screen and then we go doooowwwnn.
In top we have a scrolline running wild, underneath the scroller we have
a moving and distorted CED logo.
In the middle of all this is a nice drawn Condemned logo using the both
the left and right border colors.
In the lower part of the screen just underneath that logo is a very nice
horizontal moving starfield.
You can toggle between music from LTK with the 1 and 2 keys.

It's a normal kind of demoscreen but it's not bad though.

******************************** Screen 5 **********************************

Name: Texture in the world of Slime.

What's disting and moving ?? It's a giant purple slimy CED logo !!
What's underneat that then ? It's a giant slimy 32*32 scrolline !!
What's moving on the rythm of the music ?? My feat !?
Naaahhh those are little piccy's of mountains that move on the music.
That Crawdaddy dude did also the sound for this screen and you can choose
from 3 different kinds of ( digi )chip music.

What do you think about this screen ??
I can't do it, but any good coder can, so avarage !

****************************** A Guest screen ******************************

Name: A guest screen from Chronicle.

A Chronicle logo appears on the scene in the upperpart of the screen.
In the low part is a little yellow disting Creator logo.

Then the camera's get ready and i hear a scream: Action !!

The Chronicle logo disappears ( what an action ).....hold on, it's gets
replaced by some strange color effects.
Rasters are appearing on the screen and start to move up and down.
A small scrolltext appears above that little ( now ) sliding ( left/right )
logo of Creator with the greetings.
There is a circle of dots rotating and there is a distorted Chronicle logo
moving on the screen.
In the background is some text for you to read and there music by Max of
Chronicle.

Quite impressive for Chronicle standards and i think that Creator is
improving fast on his coding skills.
Keep this up and you become some serious competition for Condemned.

********************************* R E S E T ********************************

Well that's it for the demoscreens in the main-menu, so i press the reset
to see if there is something left to look at.
I was lucky because there appears text on the my screen saying that i'm
in the reset demo.
After the text there are some sprites with CED 1992 moving in some sort of
wave form over my screen from low to the upperpart.

Lets press the reset again ( i'm a reset maniac ).
Part two of the reset part appears but this time with only information and
lots of greetings ( by the way thanks for the greetings ).

****************************** SOME LAST WORDS *****************************

I think that this is not a bad demo and it's surtenly of the better demo's
from Finland.
The coding is quite good and the graphics are not bad as well, with very
good music by Crawdaddy, LTK and Max.
Well time for some figures and the overall rating,

Code    : 8+
GFX     : 8-
Music   : 9

Overall : 8+

I hope you keep this quality coding up and even improve it.
