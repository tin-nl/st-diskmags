DENTRO'S

This is a little article about something new, it's called a DENTRO it's
a mix between a demo and an intro.
It's smaller then a demo and bigger than an intro. A DENTRO is around 
200 kb( packed ), at least the Dentro of the Hemoroids.

I have seen 2 DENTRO'S till now one of the HEMOROIDS and one of LEGACY.
Here comes a little review of these two DENTRO'S.

HOLD IT, i got a brand new one released at the Duesseldorf Messe 1992.
It is made by Animal Mine. So now i do a review of 3 Dentro's.


Dentro :HEMOROIDS. 
-----------------
This Dentro starts with a picture of Ghostbusters, with the famous 
middle finger of your hand.

After this you get to hear some real good music. If you have a STE
machine this will be in stereo. I liked this music very much.

Then a really nice logo appears, followed by a picture with DENTRO drawn
on it.

Next you get a starfield with some nice moving text in all kind directions
and zooming in and out (real good), followed by the members of Hemoroids.

You can use the following key's, space / esc / undo.
  space : Go to the next text.
  undo  : Goes a little back so you can see the text again.
  esc   : Go to the next part.

There are two nice pictures in it.

After all that you get the greetings list, this one looks nice also.
While there are greetings of several groups, there is a flag moving on
the background of the country were they live, made of colored dots.



Dentro : by LEGACY  (TITEL : MY SOCKS ARE WEAPONS) 
--------------------------------------------------

First the screen goes wild. This is like i boot the computer on a
monochrome moniter, with my switch box.

Then you see a picture, followed by a starfield and the credits.
Some text is next, followed by the title My Socks Are Weapons with
a lot of sprites over the screen.
The text is moving nice. 

Next is a screen with a Legacy logo 3D vectorballs and a scrolline.

Next are some 3D line objects, followed by 16*16 vector balls, again 
followed by vertical rasters.

The member screen looks good, there are some bubble's going up.

Last is the greetings list, there is again a logo and there is a scrolline.


Dentro : ANIMAL MINE. 
--------------------

This Dentro starts with a logo of Animal Mine, and that they present
the Dentro.The screen of Atari Fair Dentro looks nice.

Next there is a starfield with a scrolline, introducing shade bobs.

Shade bobs is something new, i have seen it 1 or 2 times before.

Next is a funny picture.

After that you get an Animal Mine logo with moving bobs.

Then a 3D object, followed by the credits and the greetings, this
greetings list is very long.

Last they tell you something about the 'FALCON'. (I think everybody is
buying this computer when it is in stores).

That's it this time, i hope to see you in another article in this magazine.
