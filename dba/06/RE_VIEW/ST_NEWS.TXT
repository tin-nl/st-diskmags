                         ST NEWS 7.2 PREVIEW,

****************************************************************************

                         INTRODUCTION,

Somewhere in the year 1986 some people decided to create a diskmagazine.
This was the beginning of a long and succesfull story about the first
magazine on the Atari ST called: ST News.
After some years of producing ST News, there was a moment that both of the
main staff members where to busy with their jobs, they stopped producing the
magazine because the jobs took to much of their time. 
Most people thought that this was the end of the track for ST News, but
some time later the first undead issue popt up.
The two main editors of this " Cult " magazine decided to continue their
work on the magazine and started to release some more undead issue's.

The two people that i'm talking about are Richard Karsmakers and Stepan 
Posthuma, some welknown guys from the scene.
With the release of ST News 7.2 they show that they still can make a
good magazine, they even are improved ( call it evolution ) if you ask me.
Lets take a closer look at the magazine,

*************************** THE USERS INTERFACE ****************************

The magazine still uses the old pulldown menu system, although Stepan has
improved the system with some very useful and new features.
It is a very reliable system and it is very easy to use too.
Although is not as fancy as both our own and the Delta Force icon menu 
system's, it is so much better as some other pulldown menu's i've seen.
It's a part of the magazine's look and i think that they must keep it that
way.
All textfiles are packed, this gives you more free space on your disk and
you can't read the textfiles without the program.
But with lots of free space left, you have to write a lot more articles
to fill up you diskspace with.

The scrolling of the text is a bit yerky, but if i'm correct the magazine 
runs also on 512 machine's.
It eats lots of memory to get a really smooth scrolling and i don't think
that ST News will work on a 512 machines anymore.
So no real complains on that part, because our magazine won't even run 
on 512 ST's through the use of all those fancy technique's.
When you have loaded an article it will stay in memory, so if you click
on the same article again it won't have to load.
It only holds the last article you've loaded.

Also nice is the fact that you can use both mouse and keyboard to control
the menu with( you can now also exit with the right mouse button ).
The magazine program can save 1 Word+ articles and can send it also out
to the printer.
There is also a format option, which is a very nice option if you forgot
to format a disk when you want to save an article in ST News.
You can also change the colors and save the whole setup !
The magazine has only one piece of music and one picture, it would be
nice to hear/see some more in one issue.
Well, at least there is a music toggle function that stops/starts the music 
if you get sick from listening to it after i while.

********************************* TOPICS ***********************************

This particular issue has 5 pulldown menu's with different subjects.

************************** SHORT ARTICLE REVIEW ****************************

As you can see there is a wide choice of subjects you can read about.
I will take some nice topics out of the list that i think are very nice.

Most magazines have no adventure solutions anymore or never had.
For the people who play those games, ST News can be a very important source
of information.
Keep this going guys as there are not many adventure solutions anymore in
other magazine's ( paper or disk ).

The Cheat Encyclopeadia is the biggest roundup of game cheats that i have
ever seen on a disk-magazine.
Very nice for the game addicted freaks that get stuck somewhere in a game.

The Concerts reports are also very nice to read about.
Keep that up, Richard.

JournalLYNX is a must for the LYNX freaks and provides you with good
information and news about the new games.
Nice touch.....

The good old Did You Know article is still fun to read and is one of my
favourite articles in the magazine.

Non computer proceedings seems to get very popular these days.
People want to read more and more about the "normal" things in life.
You must never forget our mutual interest though and that are the Atari
computers.

The reviews are not always up-to-date but they are very well written.
Well worth to look into.

******************************* CONCLUSION *********************************

All articles are well written and are from very high quality.
There is a wide choice of different subjects in this magazine and everybody
can find their own interest's in it.
ST News contains better written articles then most other magazine's including 
our own D.B.A. magazine.
We try to get our articles to an higher standard but we never can get on
the same level as ST News !

There are also some good P.D. programs on the disk for your pleasure.
I know how difficult it is to get some good utilities or other useful
programs these days.
No comment on that either......

ST News is an example for the rest and it is a big inspiration to us.
We hope that you are going to continue on the Falcon but that isn't any
problem i think because ST News runs okay on this machine.
Keep up the good work and good luck for the future........
