                              BY IMPACT

****************************************************************************

This a demo by the French crew called Impact and another crew which name
is unknown.
It's an anti Fuzion demo, there seems to be a war going on between these two
crews and there seem to be many more crews who are participating also.
Most of the crews are from the cracking scene and they accus each-other
from stealing cracked programs and claiming that they cracked it themselfs.
To be honest with you, it is al a little lame what they are doing, they are
putting their skills in slagging each-other off.
Why not using your skills to produce nice demo's, compils, utility's or
writing something for our magazine !?
You are all free to send your side of the story to our magazine, this way 
everybody can judge for themselfs who is wrong or right.
We only want to know how it happend that you all got in a struggle, so no
lame slaggings in this magazine like: fuck ****** !!

******************************* THE DEMO ***********************************

Let's see what it is all about.............
Yep, lets do the old and approved procedure: disk in the drive and booting
the whole stuff with one push on the reset button !
Tak tak tak .............

****************************** THE INFO SCREEN *****************************

After the loading an info screen appears with some credits and greetings.
There is a module playing at 17,5 Khz and it's sounding good.
Nothing heavy here..........

There is no Main Menu in this demo and you must load screen after screen
by pressing on the tallest key you have on your keyboard.

********************************* SCREEN 1 *********************************

On this screen is a big skull bounching up and down, there is a starfield
in the background.
In the lower part of the screen is a small scrolline and there is also
a module playing.
The screen bombs after a while on my computer, quite a boring screen....

******************************** SCREEN 2 **********************************

On the left upperpart of the screen is the text: My Dog is Enjoying Fuzion.
There is a big dog on this screen who is F**king a Fuzion logo.
Also on this screen is another little scrolline in the lower part of the 
screen and there is a module playing.
This screen is the " best one " of them all, but it is not a real entertaining
screen if you ask me.

******************************* SCREEN 3 ***********************************

After the usual loading and depacking there begins a module to play and a
picture appears on the screen.
It's a picture of a creature looking like the devil who is destroying Fuzion
disks in some sort of meat machine.
If you press space another picture appears on the screen........
Well see it for yourself, another boooorrring screen with good music.

*************************** THE FINAL SCREEN 4 *****************************

In the upper part of the screen is a distorted Impact logo.
Just below the logo are two little scrollines with one bigger scrolline in
the middle of it.
In the lower part is a scrolline that is bounching up and down and yeahh
there is another module playing.

****************************** CONCLUSION **********************************

A complete waste of time to make a demo like this and if you must do this
why don't you do a good job of it.
All in all a boring demo with some good module music and that's the only
thing worth to mention.
Now for some figures ( well they explane everything these days don't they ?).

Code     : 6+
Graphics : 7-
Sound    : 7+

Overall  : 6+

I hope that the Impact megademo will be far superior to this one !
Lets hope that all the crews involved in this little war get some wisdom
and stop slagging each-other.
