Released Through : Virgin Games

Price (England) : around œ35.00



Scenario:-
----------

        You are a king. Your job is to find a princess!  (I think she is?!)
She has been kidnapped by The Skorls. That's it really!


General:-
---------

         The game is a bit difficult to get into a first. It is one of those
games where, if you dont find a certain object, you cant carry out certain 
actions and hence (if you dont find the object or clue) the game very quickly
grinds down to a very obscure halt!  If you do find an object then it more than
lightly you will instantaneously work out what you should use the object for.

For example:-


You need the knife to free this en-prisoned Jester who then pushes the bricks
away to show a hidden passage (you are too weak to do so!).  So if you could
not find the knife you would not be able to free him, hence not being able to
carry on with the game! (bastard, eh?)   Just incase you did not know:-

Find the knife on the barrel and use it on the leather chord on the torture rac

        When you have gone down the passage you get a very bad "ST YM2149f" 
scriech! As to produce the effect of falling! (and what was wrong with an
aaaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!!!! sample???? - the game programmer does it again!) 
When you have reached the climax of the fall you are found at the end of a
sewage pipe (from the castle - no!)   Handly (and unfairly) the Jester is
magically transported to the archway infront of you! 
   
         When you have gone through the archway you are situated in the village
You must then go around the village finding clues, knowing people and generally
getting lost and pissed off!    You should first find your way to the
blacksmiths where you find the Dad of the (I think to be) princess (horny
b_tch!)    He will then give you certain instructions about what to do. For
example find wizards who gives you a lock-pic (I have not been able to use it
yet!).   

          The gameplay area is quite bit (the characters are quite complex, you
have to find out certain things, for the person you are talking to, to be
able to have a useful conversation with him/her!   

           There are no sex scenes (I say bring back Defenders Of The Crown and
marry Rebecca!!!!!!!!!) 


Grafix:-
--------
            Very slick grafix in this. The animation is excellent but it shows
that they were stretching the pallette (ie. RESTRICTIONS!!!!!!)  The colours
are used to great advantage and have been used extremly well! They have gone to
quite a lot of detail (ie. facial expressions!) 

             The opening grafix (intro bits) are quite well done but the intro
(animation) is not!   The story and samples are quite good but a waste of disks
  
             The font used is a bit crud! (system font is better! - in a way!)


Sound:-
-------

              Nice samples but there is no Tracker music on the intro and there
are only samples within the game!  No beeping squeals!



Speed:-
-------

              The game comes on 4 disks (boot, data 1,2 and 3).   It uses the
advantaged external disk drive. Apart from the fact that itt says (on first
disk request) :-

                 "Put Data Disk A into Drive A"

Alot of games now use this advantage but then again it is difficult??? Just
use a disk light flash system!      

               When you go to a new screen it has to load the data (only takes
5-7 seconds but that is 5-7 seconds of you getting bored of waiting for the
screen to load, whereas you have already been to that screen around 5 million
times before!  Why cant they wack it in the back of memory???  



Overall:-
---------

               A very nice, well put together little game! (well big I suppose)
I would recommend people to buy it!   But lets see what the Falcon has to
produce (and (as I think), will f*ck up like the STE bugs etc or the Amiga plus
efforts (oh look this game doesnt work either!!))
