                         THE N.P.G. MEGA DEMO,

****************************************************************************

It's has been quiet on the ST scene for some time now.......
But now there is finally some action and loads of new demo's see the light
of day.
Most of the released demo's contain the old things, they only improved
the old routines and added some new graphics to it.
Everything is already done on the ST or is to complicated to code if you
ask me.
It's hard to come up with new ideas that isn't already done in some old
demo, although i'm convinced that there are many more effects to invent.

The N.P.G. demo isn't bringing us any new things eather, but the demo
has a lot of class.
It contains some nice graphics and the coding is from high quality, a very
good demo from a group that is mostly known from compact menu's !

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE LOADER * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

Okay lets put the disk in the ST and switch it on.
A message appears on the screen saying : Disk X cess just wait please !
They really leave me no choice or do they !?
Some 15 seconds later things start to light up a bit, because I get 
a intro screen on the monitor.

A picture of a valley is filling the lower part of the screen and a bowl
made of colored dots spin's around in the upper part of the screen.
Caracters come flying out of the valley and they form words in the lower
part of the screen.
Some pictures pop up, one is a logo of N.P.G. and an other-one is a big
Dragon with some text( something in German, translation was hard because 
the picture disappeard to fast ).
The pictures seem to be displayed in random order everytime you load the
intro because i saw some other ones too.
There only one thing about this intro, why can I not press space to get
to the main-menu !?
Good intro...........

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE MAIN-MENU * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The main-menu appears when the intro is ended.
In the higher part of the screen is a big N.P.G. logo, on this logo are
some creatures doing things with ropes and Jo-Jo's( nice touch ).
Above the logo is a big scrolline running through the screen.
You must guide a man with a big drill with your cursor-keys to the screens.
The screens are little boxes in the ground and to enter a screen you must
drill on one of the boxes by pressing the space-bar !
Nice parallax scrolling while moving the man through the main-menu screen,
the background is very well drawn with the left/right border colors used.

Very good is the fact that the main-menu stays in memory and it "remembers"
which screen you have enterd last.
Cool main-menu........

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * WE WANNA EGGS * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Everytime you load a demo-screen there is an information screen first with
the credits and the text: loading and after that decrunching.
After decrunching you must press space to see the demo-screen appear.

Okay of with the first screen then,

All of the stuff begins by showing a picture with the title of the screen
drawn all over it.
There is a landscape and the blue sky and then a big bird appears on the
scene and dumps three eggs on the ground.
Ohh goody, the eggs begin to hatch and you get to see three little birdy's.
The birdy's begin to sing and they whistle and shake their heads on the 
rhythm of the ( module ) music.
I believe it is a conversion of the Budbrain screen from the aMIGa.
Nice though.........

** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** COPPER POWER ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** 

Most screens seems to start with a picture and this screen also has one,
saying: We don't need a copper.
Some nice vertical distorted rasters show up and begin to wave over the
screen.
The upper and lower border colors are used in the screen and a piece of
digi-drum music is playing.
Other new effects appear on the screen with many different waveforms.
Very good screen..........

* ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * CRISTALLO * ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * **

Starting with the text:Apollo of N.P.G. presents Cristello.
3 layers of background pictures are moving parallax on the screen.
There are caracters forming words and in the lower part of the screen is
the text: New Power Generation.
A digi-drum tune is playing while I watch the screen.
Looks to much like a TLB screen to me !

* * ** * * ** * * ** * * ** * * SLIDESHOW * * ** * * ** * * ** * * ** * * **

This screen contains some pictures that form a short ( funny ) story.
The pictures bounce on the screen and they bounce out of the screen when
they get changed.
In the low part of the screen is a bytebending scrolline running through
the screen.
Normal ( moody ) music here.........
Nice but not really amazing( it wasn't really ment to be, I think ).

****************************** MULTISCROLL *********************************

This is not an original screen but it contains good code, though !
A big distorted background appears looking suspiciously like the one of ULM.
Then lots of vertical moving and distorting scrollines appear on the 
screen with some music from Max playing.
Good code but an old idea !

++*++*++*++*++*++*++*++*+++*++* PLANE-O-MATIC *++*++*++*++*++*++*++*++*++*++

The screens starts with a piccy showing a circuit-board with the title of
the demo-screen drawn on it.
You must press the big-one to continue with the rest of the screen.

There is an distorted N.P.G. logo wobbling in the upper part of the screen.
Somewhere in the middle of the screen are dots that change to different
kinds of objects.
There is one bytebending, one big bounching and four vertical scrollines 
moving on screen !
Mad-Max also joins the party with some hippy-chippy music.
Avarage demo-screen.........

(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*) VECTOR SCREEN (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)

Guess what, yeeaaah a piccy first !
First there is some text that gives you information about the object that
is about to appear.
A cube starts to fly over the screen and many different objects will follow.
Effect's like lightsource and other things are also in the demo-screen, the
text keeps appearing with new info. about the many objects !
Not as fast as the Kruz routines but nevertheless a very good screen !

/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\ MULTIPART /*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*\/*

This is an Dentro kind of screen with different effects.
There are words appearing on the screen and they explode when the words
change or disappear( nice looking effect ) !
After the text a cube comes flying over the screen, after that some vertical
rasters come danching over the screen.
In the lower border is a scrolltext and when the rasters are gone away, a
big bytebending scrolltext moves over the screen.
In the background is a horizontal starfield and the module is sounding
like a track from the Fine Young Cannibals ( She drives me crazy ).

It all ends with a big booommm !!
A very nice Dentro kind of screen with nice effects in it !

///////////////////////////// HIDDEN SCREEN ? \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

There is a Hiddenscreen in this demo, which i havn't discoverd yet !
I didn't have time looking for it, but that's okay otherwise there is
nothing for you to look for !

                             ****************
                             *              *
                             *              *
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ RESET SCREEN ////////////////////////////////

When you press the reset-button, a reset screen pops up !
A wobbling N.P.G. logo is floating on the screen and a very good module
is playing in the background.
You can press the up and down keys to scroll through some information
screens with credits.

******************************* CONCLUSION *********************************

The N.P.G. mega-demo is a very good demo with very good graphics and some
good code !
I really hope that you guys do another one in the future with some more
original effects on the ST.
