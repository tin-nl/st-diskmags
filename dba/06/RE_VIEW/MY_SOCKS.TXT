The demo loads up and you are presented with a nice piccy by Pixelkiller (It
is a cornfield thing being struck by lightning) I must stress that the piccy
is so nice that I ripped it !!

The piccy then fades out and you are presented with a bob starfield and some
text telling you the credits. Whilst this is going on your ears are treated
to a real cool soundtrack-tune called 'Hysteria' by Audiomonster. Finally
the credits finish and you are shown a blue background with some little bits
of gfx at the top and bottom. Then some text wiggles onto the screen and the
musix gets ready and the text fades out and a 'My socks...' logo appears with
some bobs and 32*16 bytebender (Quite nice too!)

The the text waffles on again telling you that you are about to see some 3D
linevectors by Fury. The linevectors are quite nice with some subtle raster
shading and some cute transformations. Then the vector gfx bugger off only
to be replaced by some vectorballs (16*16) and they wibble about and do
some funky transformations and then some wierd rotating vertical rasters
appear with some very cool shading (Nice stuff Legacy!).

Legacy, never wanting you to get bored, immediately whizz onto their member
list with some bubbles floating behind it! Hmm... not bad! Then you get the
greetings scroller, with a nice legacy logo up the top. That's it!!
