FUTURE OF ATARI

                   AN OPINION OF THE FUTURE OF ATARI
                   ---------------------------------

Several people this year has said, that Atari will soon die. Hmmm,
how is it possible to own an ST, if you don't believe in it even
by yourself? I find that very strange and stupid...

ST/E is not going to disappear. Maybe it won't be one of the leading
computers in Europe/USA, but I can't believe it just disappears
like C-64. FALCON 030 will replace ST what it comes to high quality
and low price, but ST/E still will be used widely in text-processing,
MIDI-market and also for playing games...

The only problem is that we need that FALCON quite fast (hopefully it
is launched at Duesseldorf in this August) or people won't believe
in it anymore... If the machine has as low price and high quality as
the rumours has said, it will sweep Amiga away from this planet...

So, my point is that you should stop saying that Atari is going to 
die, 'coz that just isn't true... ST/STE/TT/FALCON is the very best!
