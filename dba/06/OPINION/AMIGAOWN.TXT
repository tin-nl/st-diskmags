AMIGA-OWNERS

                      YO FREAX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IN THIS ARTICLE I WANT TO WRITE ABOUT THE PREJUDICES AMIGA-OWNERS MOSTLY 
HAVE AGAINST THE ST.

FOR EXAMPLE YOUNG GAME-FANATICS (OF COURSE FROM THE AMIGA) SLANDER 
ABOUT THE ST BECAUSE "HE" HAS LESS THAN 4096 COLORS.ALSO THEY SAY THAT  
THEIR COMP HAS MULTITASKING THAT MAKES THEIR MACHINE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE  
AND THAT THE SOUND BLASTS EVERYBODY AWAY.THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE ST
AND REPEAT ALWAYS THINGS WHICH THEY HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER PERSONS.

MANY CRITICISM COME COZ OF THE SOUND.THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE THAT MOST ST-
PROGRAMS USE CHIP SOUNDS AND NOT MODULES AS ON THE AMIGA.IF YOU TELL THEM
THIS FACT THEY SAY THAT YOU MUST BE MAD.A LOT OF CODERS FROM THE AMIGA
SAY THAT THE ST IS NOT USEFULL FOR CODING COZ "HE" HAS NO BLITTER,NO GOOD
ASSEMBLER-PROGS,ETC.IN MANY CASES THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ANY PRODUCTIONS (DEMOS)
WHICH ARE MADE BY A ST-GROUP.FOR A LOT OF AMIGOS THE GFX ON THE ST IS SHIT
COZ "HE" HAS ONLY 512 COLORS (SOME PERSONS ARE REALLY COMPLETELY MAD!!!) .

OFTEN THEY SLANDER ABOUT THE STE,TOO.THE SEE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ST 
AND A STE (YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE HARDWARE FROM A STE AND AN AMIGA ARE NEARLY 
THE SAME) .

FINALLY I COULD SAY THAT I KNOW ONLY A FEW AMIGA-USERS WHO HAVE AN
ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ST WHICH IS O.K.
ONE OF THEM IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM IF YOU HAVE 
SEEN SOME AMIGA-DEMOS WHICH ARE PRODUCED IN 1992.
HIS NAME IS "LORD" AND HE BELONGS TO A GROUP CALLED "CULT".HE IS A REALLY
COOL CODER AND INTERESTED IN USING SOME CHIP-MUSAX FROM THE ST (E.G. LAP
AND COUNT ZERO) ON THE AMIGA.

P.S. I AM NOT AGAINST THE AMIGA BUT I HATE THE USERS WHO SAY THAT THEIR
     MACHINE IS THE ONE AND ONLY (I CAN GIVE YOU A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF
     PERSONS I DESCRIBED HERE).
