MATT'S POEM

A poem by MATT of the Untouchables:


"the perfect program"
---- ------- -------

"no program's that perfect"
they said with a shrug.
"the client is happy--
what's one little bug?"

but he was determined
the others went home
he dug out the flow chart
deserted. alone.

night passed into morning
the room was quite littered
with core dumps and punch cards.
"i'm closer." he tittered.

chain smoking, cold coffee.
logic, deduction.
"i've got it!" he cried.
just change one instruction.

then change two, then three more
as year followed year.
and strangers would comment
"is that guy still here?"

he died at the console
of hunger and thirst
next day he was buried
face down, nine edge first.

(for those of you lucky guys (and gals) who never got to use cards,
"face down, nine edge first" is how you insert cards into a card reader)
