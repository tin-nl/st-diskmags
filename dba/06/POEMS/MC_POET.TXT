COOL POEM

Yo brothers and sisters MC is here ones more to bring you a little poem 
of his! A big hug to my special friend in Drachten, Miss Angel I will
see you in my dreams babe! Well this time's theme is womans women you now
the ones who bites of your dick if they are in that mood! I'M sorry if I
have offended someone or if im going to do it in the near future. So folks
read and weep!!!

No woman no cry

The world has always been a bit crazy
so when this womans woman called Dazy
enterd the political scean
it was quite bloddy obscean

She waved her tits around the block
so all men gatherd in one big flock
she ruled with a strong womens hand
so she stated to get unpopular all over the land
she thought she could rule in just one way
but she ruled just one day

Nowadays she lives back home
where she fixes her hear with a combe
She got twelve children and are the perfect house wife
and thats what she is going to be for the rest of her life

This poem has nothing to do with real events or real persons
so please don't sue me or something. See you later MC signs off.
