        A LITTLE FLOWER
        REALLY A LITTLE FLOWER
        SHE WAS GROWING
        HER HEART WAS SO HAPPY
        SHE WAS SINGING
        THE WHOLE DAY LONG
        NOBODY COULD TAKE OF 
        THE HAPPINNES OF THAT FLOWER
        THE WHOLE WORLD WAS A PARADISE
        AND THIS FLOWER
        HAD A LOT OF ENERGY
        THEN ONE EVENING SUDDENLY
        IT BEGAN TO RAIN
        FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS
        THE STALK WAS BROKEN
        OF THIS YOUNG LITTLE FLOWER
        THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER FLOWER
        AND SAW THE SADNESS IN HER EYES
        HE WAS SWEET FOR HER 
        AND TALKED WITH HER
        AFTER SOME MONTHS
        THE FLOWER WAS STRONGER
        SHE HAD GOT A LITTLE BIT
        CARE AND LOVE OF THAT STRANGER
        NOW THE STALK IS ALMOST RECOVERED
        THE LITTLE FLOWER
        CAN SING AGAIN
        AND WILL SHOW YOU
        HER NAUGHTY LOOK
        IN HER EYES
        AND NEVER SHE WILL FORGET
        HER SWEET STRANGE FLOWER
        WHO HAVE GIVE HER SO MANY POWER FOR LIVE
