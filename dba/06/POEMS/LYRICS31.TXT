         Danzig is one of my favourite bands. If you haven't heard
ever about Samhain, Misfits or Danzig music don't bother to buy this
album. I think all the fans who know that band trilogy will surely
get this album at any price because the singer GLEN DANZIG. The music
DANGIZ plays isn't easy to descripe. It's very original way they play
music and the singer is of course which makes this music so powerful.
I don't know what would be the right band to compare this music but
if you like bands like NIRVANA,TAD,RAGING SLAB or PIXIES you might
like this band too. I recommend you first to get their first album:
DANZIG:DANGIZ and then if you like it get the second and third albums
because you will surely find out after listening to first one if you
like this kind of music.I personally like most of all about the first
DANZIG album and after second comes this third one. If you are old
DANZIG fan you have probably got this album already or if not GO AND
GET IT!!!!!  It's still worth to listen again...again... ... ... If
you are wondering what kind of lyrics they are using just read the
name of the album...
                   

 GODLESS

         godless
         feeling   in me
         night
         after     night
         godless
         feeling   in me
         borne
         of        their lies

         you gave me all of this
         and more
         yea, that's for sure
         i can't believe in all your pain
         under the draining of a
                                  christian
                                  deities blood
         you tell your children   they're insane

         i couldn't love it anymore
         i had to listen to my heart
         i couldn't take it anymore
         and so you leave me
                                  godless 

         just spread your         tentacles
                                  of hate
                                  around my life
         i've taken more than you could even give
         you can't believe that   someone
                   challenges
                   your right
         i'm gonna send you back your pain

         i couldn't love it anymore
         i had to listen to my heart
         i couldn't take it anymore
         and so you leave me
                                  godless
                                   
         i ask all who have gathered here to join me
         in this feast may we always be strong in body
                                                spirit
                                              and mind
         and all those who would try to harm us
         let them be cast aside

 BODIES
 
         CHORUS:

         bodies    please don't cry
         bodies    don't cry
         bodies    please don't cry
         bodies

         i been taking all the silver
         i been saving all the gold
         i'm gonna stuff it down the throat
         of a week old corpse
         save that doggone soul
         
         i been saving up my pain
         i'm gonna give it back in spades
         i been strangling the cries
         from the murder of love
         save your soul tonight

         i been raising up the dead
         gonna send them to the house of cain
         i been praying in light
         of the waning moon
         slay your doggone soul
         i been taken out of heaven
         i been put upon this world
         i been walking up and down
                   to and fro

         save your doggone soul
         
         i got bodies on the left
         i got bodies on the right
         i got bodies    up and down
                         all across town
         save your soul tonight


 HOW THE GODS KILL

         if you feel alive
         in a darkened room
         do you know the name
         of your solitude
         if you ain't got the answer
         if you don't know the truth
         if you want the power
         then let it flow through
         
         would you let it go
         would you let it go
         they cannot end this mourning
                   of my life
         show me
         how the gods kill

         if you feel alive
         if you got no fear
         do you know the name
         of the one you seek
         if you want the answer
         if you want the truth
         look inside your empty soul
         there
         you'll find the noose

         would you let it go
         would you let it go
         they cannot end this mourning
                   of my life
         show me
         how the gods kill


 DIRTY BLACK SUMMER

         no summer in the wintertime
         will keep your warm        like a funeral pyre
         and nothing                like an august night
                                    drenched
                                    in you loving
         i got a dirty
                   black summer
         and nothing                in the coolest light
         can stop the walking out   across
                                    the line
         no holding back the summer night
                                    i got a feeling
         it's just a dirty
                   black summer
