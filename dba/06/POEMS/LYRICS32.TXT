DANZIG III :HTGK 2


 LEFT HAND BLACK

         kinda like a dog
                   w/ seven pupils
                   in its eye
         kinda like a madness
                   that refuses
                   to subside
         kinda like everything you want
         just w/in your grasp
         kinda like
         how a banshee-wail
         dances
                   on a living heart
         i'm gonna stand
         at the top       of the world
                   challenge the heavens
         gonna bring you god
         gonna bring you god
         in the palm of the left
                          hand
                          black
         gonna bring you god
         kinda like
                   when the sun goes down
                   and darkness makes its climb
         kinda like all your muscle tissue
         starting to unwind
         kinda like
         if you brave the hate
                          feed it
                          to the left hand black
         how i know
         i can take their power
         send it back
                          triple times the strength
         who i see the battle
         and the bleeding         human race
         how i miss the taste of it
         its sweet        and warm
                          embrace
         how i see
         the world's demise
         its last
         and final gasp
         how i see        reality
                          explode
         into another kind of life


 HEART OF THE DEVIL

         i am
                   heart
                   of the  devil
         i have
                   heart
                          of the
                   devil

         i can make a man
         freeze in his tracks
         i can make a man
         fall to his death
         
         i can make a girl
         so eager to please
         i can make a young girl
         lay down
         for me    because
                   i'm evil
         and
         love is gone
         
         i can make the skies
         thunder and shake
         i can make the world
         tremble and quake
         i can make your pulse
         pound in your veins
         i can make your heart
         stop
         and start
         again     because
                   i'm evil
         love is gone
         
         i can make the world
         tremble and shake
         i can make the skies
         black in my wake
         i can make a girl
         so eager to please
         i can make a young girl
         lay down
         for me    because
                   i'm evil
        and
        love is gone
                   my love is gone


 SISTINAS

         take my hand
         you'll    never find
         another   quite like mine
         if you look
         you'll    see that i'm
                   a lonely one

         i         lost my soul
                   deep inside
        
         and it's so
         black
         and cold   deep inside
        
         sistine smile
         you'll     never know
         the trap it's set
         and if you did
         you'd      never look
                   into
                   its eyes
         the sun don't shine
         the wind won't blow
         when you go hide
         without your love
                   i'm lonely
                   deep inside


 DO YOU WEAR THE MARK

         devil on the left
         angel on the right
         there's no mistake
         who i'll be w/ tonight
         over in the fore
         lamb's head on my lap
         days
         pass like weeks w/o the sight
         
         then      come the fury of the lullaby
         then      come the fury of the lullaby
         
         heartbeat in a hole
         an eyeball       loose and wild
         dropping memories
         out upon the open tiles
         and over to the left
         there sit the    loveless ones
         crying slowly       and sucking on a gun
         
         do you wear the mark
         do you wear the mark
         darling   darling
         do you wear the mark


 WHEN THE DYING CALLS

         out
         of the night comes
         a timeless thing
         calm
         in simplicity
         whispers
         soft
         a seductive voice
         meant for the human ear
         down
         down
         down
         i'm gonna take you
         down
         that's when the dying calls

         if i look
         in the dark of the world
         if i lose
                   i don't mind
         that's when the dying calls
         down
         thru the ages
         from the dawn of time
         roam
         thru the world of dreams
         up
         from the black
         of the missisippi mud
         calling
         out to everything
         down
         down
         down
         i'm gonna bring you
         down
         that's when the dying calls
         
         if i play
         in the dark of the world
         if i lose
                   i don't mind
         that's when the dying calls
