MEGADETH : CTE (2)         

 THIS WAS MY LIFE

         It was just another day
         It was just another fight
         It was words strung into sentences
         It was doomed to not be right
         
         There is something wrong with me
         There is something wrong with you
         There is nothing left of us
         There is one thing I can do
         
         CHORUS
         Lying on your bed,
         Examing my head
         That is the part of me that hates
         Paybacks are a bitch
         I throw the switch
         Somewhere an electric chair awaits
         Hey! This was my life
         Hey! This was my life
         
         This was the wrong thing to do
         This was the wrong one to be doing
         This was the road to destiny 
         This was the road to my ruin
         
         Now there's motives for the suspect
         Now there's nothing left to say
         Now there's method to the madness
         Now there's society to pay
         
         CHORUS
         
         In our life there's if
         In our beliefs there's lie
         In our business there's sin
         In our bodies there's die
         
         This was my life
         This was my fate


 COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION
 
         Endangered species, caged in fright
         Shot in cold blood, no change to fight.
         The stage is set, now pay the price.
         An ego boost, don't think twice.
         Technology, the battle's unfair,
         You pull the hammer without a care.
         Squeeze the trigger that make you Man,
         Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...
         The hunt is canned.
         
         CHORUS
         
         All are gone, all but one.
         No contest, nowhere to run.
         No more left, only one.
         This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction.
         
         Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare.
         The skin and trophy, oh so rare.
         Silence speaks louder than words.
         Ignore the guilt, and take your turn.
         Liars anagram is "lairs,"
         Man you were never even there.
         Killed a few feet from the cages,
         Point blank, you're so courageous...
         So courageous.
         
         CHORUS
         
         One hour from now,
         another species of life form
         will disappear off the face of the planet
         forever...and the rate is accelerating.
         
         CHORUS


 HIGH SPEED DIRT
 
         Do it if you dare
         Leaping from the sky
         Hurling through the air
         Exhilarating high
         See the earth below
         Soon to make a crater
         Blue sky, black death
         I'm off to meet my maker
         
         CHORUS
         
         Energy of the gods, adrenalin surge
         Won't stop til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
         Up here in the air, this will never hurt
         I'm on my way to impact, taste the high speed dirt
         
         Paralyzed with fear
         Feel velocity gain
         Entering a near
         Catatonic state
         Pressure of the sound
         Roaring thru my head
         Crash into the ground
         Damned if I'll be dead
         
         CHORUS
         
         Jump or die!
         
         Dropping all my weight
         Going down full throttle
         The pale horse awaits
         Like a genie in a bottle
         Fire in my veins
         Faster as I go
         I forget my name
         I'm a dirt torpedo
         
         High speed dirt...
         
         
 PSYCHOTRON
        
        Assassin in stealth
        Assailant from Heloo
        Impervious to damage
        Computer on-board
        Engaged in a war
        Non-stop combatant
        Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man
        
        CHORUS
        
        Part bionic
        And organic
        Not a cyborg
        Call him Psychotron
        
        Burning inside
        Godspeed in glide
        Battle plan running
        A killing machine
        Just downright mean
        And forever gunning
        Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man
        
        CHORUS 
        
        Target to destroy
        Arms in employ
        Full assault fire threat
        Sensors indicate
        You will terminate
        Life systems disconnect
        
        CHORUS
        
        Psychotron
        
        
 CAPTIVE HONOUR
 
         Madness comes, and madness goes
         An insane place, with insane moves
         Battle without, for battles within
         Where evil lives and evil rules
         Breaking them up, just breaking them in
         Quickest way out, quickest way relief wins
         Never disclose, never betray
         Cease to speak or cease to breathe
         And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
         Kill many, and you're a conqueror
         Kill them all...Ooh...Oh you're a god!
         
         Ladies and gentleman of the jury,
         Have you reached a verdict?
         
         Yes, we have Your Honour, we find the defendant guilty!
         On all counts for crimes against all humanity.
         
         By virtue of the jury's decision and the power
         Vested in me by the state I hereby sentence you to be
         Incarcerated with no possibility of parole for life.
         
         Life?...Whadda ya mean life?...I ain't got a life.
         
         Boy!...Your soul better belong to Jesus!...
         Hmmmm-mmmm cause your ass belongs to me!
         
         CHORUS
         Captive honour, ain't no honour
         
         No time for questions
         No time for the games
         Start kicking ass
         And taking down the names
         A long shit list
         A shorter fuse
         He is untouchable
         And guarantees you'll lose
         
         CHORUS
         
         Inside the bighouse
         His nightmare unfolds
         Before he got there
         His manpussy was sold
         Black blanket welcome
         This tough guy's now a bitch
         Praying for death
         It can't be worse than this
         
         CHORUS
         
         CHORUS
         
         
 ASHES IN YOUR MOUTH
 
         People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads.
         And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads.
         Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
         Of the countless corses piled up along the wailing wall.
         
         Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords,
         Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war.
         Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain
         Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again
         
         CHORUS
         Where do we go from here?
         And should we really care?
         The end is finally here.
         God have mercy!
         
         Now we'va rewritting history,
         The one thing we've found out,
         Sweet taste of vindication,
         It turns to ashes in your mouth.
         
         CHORUS
         
         If you're fighting to live
         It's O.K. to die!
         The answer to your question is...
         Welcome to tomorrow!
         
         Where do we go from here?
         God have mercy!
         
         CHORUS
