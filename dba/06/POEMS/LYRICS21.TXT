             All the previous Megadeth albums were strange.There were
almost always been new players in every album but now there is same
guys than in they last album called RUST IN PEACE. I borrowed the new
album COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION althought I hadn't any previous albums
but I had heard most of them sometimes. And whatta hell... HEY,this
was soooooo great that I was really surprised. This is not anything
new kind of music, just basic "speed metal" but its played perfectly
and absolutely sounds excellent. I recommed you all who understand
something about "METAL" to get this one. The music contain exquisite
melodies, really heavy guitar parts (Symphony Of Destruction) and the
bass and drums are playing very well with the perfect voice by Dave
Mustaine. Some lyrics contain also interesting things to check out
the meaning of the words. Here are the lyrics so only thing you have
to do is to get a copy of this great piece of music and listen to it
again and again and again ... again ... ...


 
 SKIN O'MY TEETH

         I had wrists donning slits
         Flowing constantly
         My broken body in a wreck
         Wrapped around a tree
         A crosswalk hit and run
         The finish line for me
         People clutter in the gutter
         Take a look and see

         CHORUS
         No escaping pain
         You belong to me
         Clinging on to life
         By the skin o' my teeth
         
         My blood flows through the streets
         Deluge from the wounds
         Empty jars of sleeping pills
         On the dresser in my room
         My wet brain neighbor cranes
         His neck to see in time,
         The white lights a train
         Bearing down on me
         
         CHORUS

         I won't feel the hurt
         I'm not trash any longer
         That that doesn't kill me
         Only makes me stronger
         I need a ride to the morgue
         That's what 911 is for
         So, tag my toe and don't forget
         Ooh to close the drawer
         
         CHORUS


 SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION
 
         You take a mortal man,
         And put him in control
         Watch him become a god,
         Watch people heads a'roll
         A'roll...
         
         CHORUS
         Just like the Pied Piper
         Led rats through the streets
         We dance like marionettes,
         Swaying to the Symphony...
         Of Destruction
         
         Acting like a robot,
         Its metal brain corrodes.
         You try to take its pulse,
         Before the head explodes.
         Explodes...
         
         CHORUS
         
         The earth starts to rumble
         World powers fall
         A'warring for the heavens,
         A peaceful man stands tall
         Tall...
         
         CHORUS
         

 ARCHITECTURE OF AGGRESSION
         
         Born from the dark,
         In the black cloat of night.
         To envelop its prey below,
         Deliver to the light.
         To eliminate your enemy,
         Hit them in their sleep,
         And when all is won and lost,
         The spoils of wars are yours to keep.
         
         CHORUS
         
         Great nations built from the bones of the dead,
         With mud and straw, blood and sweat,
         You know your worth when your enemies
         Praise your architecture of aggression.
         
         Ensuing power of vacuum,
         A toppled loader dies
         His body fuels the power fire,
         And the flames rise to the sky.
         One side of his face a kiss,
         The other genodice.
         Time to pay with your ass,
         A worldwide suicide.

         CHORUS
         
         Born from the dark,
         In the black cloak of night,
         To envelop its pray below,
         Deliver to the light.
         To eliminate your enemy,
         Hit them in their sleep,
         And when all is won and lost,
         The spoils of war are yours to keep.
         
         CHORUS
 
         
 FORECLOSURE OF A DREAM
 
         Rise so high, yet so far to fall.
         A plan of dignity and balance for all.
         Political breakthrough euphoria's high.
         More borrowed money, more borrowed time.
         Backed in a corner, caught up in the race.
         Means to an end ended in disgrace.
         Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase.
         
         CHORUS
         Foreclosure of a dream,
         Those visions never seen,
         Until all is lost,
         Personal Holocaust.
         Foreclosure of a dream.
         
         Barren land that once filled a need,
         Are worthless now, dead without a deed.
         Slipping away from an iron grip.
         Nature's scales are forced to tip,
         The heartland cries, loss of all pride.
         To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried.
         Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide.
         
         CHORUS
         
         Now with new hope some will be proud.
         This is no hoax, no one pushed out.
         Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer.
         Break new ground of a new frontier.
         New ideas will surely get by.
         No deed, or dividend, Some may ask "Why?"
         You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky.
         
         Rise so high, yet so far to fall.
         A plan of dignity and balance for all.
         Political breakthrough, euphoria's high.
         More borrowed money, more borrowed time.
         
         CHORUS

         Holocaust
         
         
 SWEATING BULLETS

         Hello me...Meet the real me.
         And my misfits way of life.
         A dark black past is my
         Most valued possession.
         Hindsight is always 20-20
         But looking back it's still a bit fuzzy.
         Speak of mutually assured destruction?
         Nice story...Tell it to Reader's Digest!!!
         
         CHORUS
         Feeling paranoid
         True enemy or false friend?
         Anxiety's attacking me, and
         My air is getting thin.
         I'm in trouble for the things
         I haven't got to yet.
         I'm chomping at the bit, and my
         Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets.
         
         Hello me..It's me again
         You can subdue, but never tame me.
         It gives me a migraine headache
         Thinking down to your level.
         Yea,just keep on thinking it's my faulth
         And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance.
         Mankind has got to know
         His limitations.
         
         CHORUS
         
         Feeling claustrophobic,
         Like the walls are closing in.
         Blood stains on my hands and
         I don't know where I've been.
         I'm in trouble for the things
         I haven't got to yet.
         I'm sharpening the axe and my
         Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets.
         
         Well, me...It's nice talking to myself,
         A credit to dementia.
         Some day you too will know my pain,
         And smile its blacktooth grin.
         If the war inside my head
         Won't take a day off I'll be dead.
         My icy fingers claw your back,
         Here I come again.
         
         CHORUS
         
         Feeling paranoid
         True enemy of false friend?
         Anxiety's attacking me
         And my air is getting thin
         Feeling claustrophobic
         Like the walls are closing in
         
         Blood stains in my hands
         And I don't know where I've been
         Once you committed me
         Now you're acquitted me
         Claiming validity
         For your stupidity
         I'm chomping at the bit
         I'm sharpening the axe
         Here I come again, whoa!
         Sweating bullets
