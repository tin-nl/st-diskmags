As most Lynx & Lynx II owners know, Atari haven't been releasing a great
many games for their super handheld console, but they are now getting into
the swing of things and 1992 is the year that they have marked down as the
one to get into top gear.

First out of the bag will be the 'Batman Returns' available on the Lynx way
before any other home computer versions (UK release date - 23rd July 1992)
hit the streets.  The home-computer versions are being distributed by
Konami, whilst Sega & Nintendo have bought the rights for their own range
of consoles.  Home-computer versions should be out by October, whilst the
Sega & Nintendo versions are due out next year !!

'Batman Returns' is the much-hyped sequel to the original Batman movie and
is destined to be a mega-hit on the Lynx for the usual price of œ29.95 (UK).

Following up on the release of 'Batman Returns', Atari have confirmed that
their first 4 meg cartridge will be released until the title of 'Dracula',
whereas current Lynx games have a maximum of 2 meg.  Lots more memory should
mean lots more action !!

UK marketing manager, Daryl Still, says that 'There may be a price increase
for the new games, but it means that we'll be producing games that are six
times bigger than our rivals.'

Twenty-three (yes! 23 !!) games are due for release between now and autumn of
1992.  Ten of them will be 4 meg games, including 'Shadow Of The Beast' (I
hope it is better than the ST version !!), 'Switchblade' and 'Eye Of The
Beholder' (Why E.A can't do this for the ST I'll never know !!).

Keep on Lynxing !!
