SUPER NINTENDO?



SUPER NINTENDO?

In England about 3 months ago the Super Nintendo was officialy 
released , this was a merry event with many 6 full page/full colour
adverts in the computer magazines.  Happyness is a console called 
Nintendo.  Unfortunatly only 5-6 games have been released, with most
of them being connected with sports, what are the sports-hating SNES
owners supposed to do?

In theory Nintendo should release a few games, of various types 
eachmonth, but this is something they have not yet started to do. 
Evennow (30/6/92) there are only the same 5-6 same games out as when 
the console was launched.  Perhaps the mighty Nintendo have made a 
error in the present stratagy.

I really hope this is noot the case for to long, 'coz the SNES is 
the best console out at the moment.  If  you think that the Mega 
Drive is good, wait untill you see a SNES running.  When you can see 
the same game running on both machines (Ghouls & Ghosts), the MD 
looks like an 8 bit machine next to the SNES.

Even so, I am not planning on buying a SNES, I am VERY tempted, but 
I am going to try and save my money for the new Atari console.  I 
think that if the new Atari machine is out before christmas, in 
europe at least, than I'll get one, even if its to piss off my mate 
with the SNES!

So Atari, get a move on and release the console, preferably with 
atleast one game by Jeff Minter (the lord and master...).

No more crap, go and read a longer article.
