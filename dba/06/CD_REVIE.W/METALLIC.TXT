METALLICA BOOTLEG

A review of the Metallica bootleg called "Detriot Bad Boys".

I am not sure if this has been mentioned in the last issue of ST 
News (7.2), because I do have it yet.  But even so here is a review 
from someone else apart from Richard K.

This double CD was recorded in Miami (I think) in the US of A, on 
the 3-11-91, so it has some songs from the present "Metallica" 
album.  Here is a list of songs and playing times...

              Total CD Time 147 minutes 53 seconds.

That is just under 2 and a half of hours METALLICA!

The whole quality of this CD is incredable, although at the very 
start the crowd clapping/cheering/screaming slightly over powers the 
sound of the music, this seems to quiet down after a few songs. 
There are also a few (3 I think) places where there has been a hitch 
during some parts of the recording and this has resulted in a jump 
or other type of interuption.  Apart from these (very small) 
problems, the actual recording is EXCEPTIONAL, it is a DDD 
recording, so they must have used a portable DAT machine, or 
something like that.

As I only have the last two Metallica albums (to my shame...), I 
cannot really comment on the live versions of the older stuff, but 
the latest songs sound really good.

If you are a Metallica fan, no matter if you only have one album, or 
all of them, I cannot recommend trying to get this enough, the 
playing is excellant and so it the quality.  If you are not a 
Metallica fan (I suppose there must be one somewhere...), but are 
starting to get into metal, I still say you must try and get this, 
it will give you a good idea of what the most origional and 
outstanding metal band of the eighties are like.

     Rating:  11 out of 10.
