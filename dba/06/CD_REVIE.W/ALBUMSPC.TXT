What ??? No CD's in the review corner ??
No, you are absolutly right, this time we got albums ( you know LP's ) in
this review corner.
Don't worry most of these albums are out on Compact Disc, so if you are
interested you can always find them in your local music-store.
The albums in question are good but i haven't got the CD version of them,
but i just wanted that you took notice of these fine records.
And off we go..........

Artist/group      : Phil Collins
Name of the Album : Face Value

Here we've got an golden oldie on our hands, it's one of the many good
records that Phil Collins made.
It's an album from his solo career without Genesis.
Did you noticed that his face is on most covers of his albums !?
Maybe he thinks that he is good looking or something, but actually he is
a bold little guy with a good bassline and an okay voice.
This guy can really play on the drums and he gets often invited to play
drums on big events like the Princes Thrust Gala.
Okay enough about that, lets listen to the album shall we.

The Album contains 12 songs,

In the Air Tonight               I Missed Again
This must be Love                You Know what i mean
Behind the Lines                 Thunder and Lighting
The Roof is Leaking              I'm Not Moving
Droned                           If Leaving Me is Easy
Hand in Hand                     Tommorow Never Knows

Well, most of you know the song: In the Air Tonight.
I can't blame you because it was a hit, you can hear Phil play some good
drums in this song.
As far as i know this is the only hit here in the Netherlands but i don't
know if any of the other songs was a hit in some other country !
There are much instruments used in this album which makes it a very
good album( lotsa trumpets, drums, synthesizer's and even with an back-
ground choir on some songs ).
All the songs are very good, as you may expect from a guy who get's
millions of dollars just by writing and singing them.
You can get this album also on the shiny little disc.
Well worth to check out...........

Artist/Group      : The Stray Cats
Name of the Album : The Stray Cats

This is an album by the....eerhhmm yep the Stray Cats an Rock and Roll band
from England.
These guys had much success a couple of years ago ( around the '80).
Leather jackets, greasy hear and lotsa Rock and Roll, this is a real good
dance album if you are in this kind of stuff.
There are only three members in the band: Brian Setzer ( vocals and the
guitar ), Slim Jim Phantom ( Drums ) and Lee Rocker ( Bass ).
For only three guys they played some good music, these are the titles on
this album,

Runaway Boys                  Rumble in Brighton
Fishnet Stockings             Stray Cat Strut
Ubangi Stomp                  Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie
Crawl up And Die              Double Talkin' Baby
Storm the Embassy             My One Desire
Rock this Town                Wild Saxaphone

Runaway Boys and the Stray Cats Strut became hits and i thought that Rock
this Town didn't do so bad as well.
The album features some nice dance music like: Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie,
Ubangi Stomp and for instance Rock this Town.
There are also some political orientated songs like: Storm the Embassy.
People who like some slow and more soft song can get off with My One 
Desire.
Get your hands on this one !

I had to make a last minute change in this article because i've just read
that they are back on the scene.
The group split up some years ago but they decided to come together again.
On the moment you read this they are in the studio recording a new album
called: Choo Choo Hot Fish.
Rockers wait and listen............

Group/Artist      : Golden Earring
Name of the Album : Northeastwestsouth

This an album by one of the oldest and most successful export group from
the Netherlands.
Being there from the very beginning with hits like for instance, Radar
Love, the group is still going strong.
The group has still his original members as far as i know which are:
George Kooymans( Lead guitar and vocals ), Barry Hay( vocals and guitar ),
Rinus Gerritsen( Bass and keyboards ) and Cesar Zuiderwijk ( pretty good
drumming ).
On the album are 8 songs of good quality, 

Clear Night Moonlight              N.E.W.S.
When the Ladie Smiles              I'll Make it all up to You
Enough is Enough                   Mission Impossible
Fist in Glove                      It's over now

Well, most people know the hit, When the Ladie Smiles with that crazy video-
clip where George seems to be possessed by women.
I really like that song and the clip, very nice !
Then we have a little hit called, Clear Night Moonlight which i personally
find a bit boring.
By the way, Mission Impossible is not the soundtrack of that C64 game( bad
joke ).
All in all a nice rock album with good songs on it.

****************************************************************************

Group/Artist      : Queen
Name of the Album : Queen Live Killers ( 2 records )

Yep, you got that right it's a live recording on 2 records of the Queen
European Tour between January - March 1979.
I don't think that it is necessary to state the groups members list as
everybody knows who they are.
The album contains much heavy material and all the hits till 1979, but
that's logical i presume.
There are loads of songs on this album, so i better could start by telling
you which songs are on the album.

Record 1,

We Will Rock You                   Now i'm Here
Let me Entertain You               Dreamers Ball
Death on Two Legs                  Love of My Live
Killer Queen                       '39
Bicycle Race                       Keep Yourself Alive
I'm in Love with my Car
Get Down, Make Love
You're My Best Friend

Record 2,

Don't Stop Me Now                  Bohemian Rhapsody
Spread Your Wings                  Tie Your Mother Down
Brighton Rock                      Sheer Heart Attack
We Will Rock You
We are the Champions
God Save the Queen

As you can see most of the songs are hits and some of them are lesser known
songs from the more heavy side of Queen.
It's a lot of work to describe all the songs on this album and it really
serves no purpose to do that, because almost every one knows them.
Altough the recording quality is not that super, it's one hell of a 
rock-album, if you ask me.
Queen always ended their concerts with: God Save the Queen.
It's a pitty that they can't do this anymore after the terrible dead of
the lead singer, Freddy Mercury !
Ofcourse i should say: check it out............

****************************************************************************

Group/Artist      : Status Quo
Name of the Album : 12 Golden Bars volume 1

Does this guy mean it ?
He can't be serious by reviewing something by Status Quo, this album is
so old and still he reviews it......
Sorry about that but i still have a place in my heart for this group.
Some people say they can't play and others say they are great, to tell you
the trueth i don't really care what you think !
This one is the first album with all the hits and the best songs of this
group from England.
The group still exist ( for more then 25 years now ) but they try to play
" normal " music now ( yuck ! ).
For the old Quo fans who sold or lost the old albums here is the opportunity
to listen to a compilation album full of songs.
The 12 golden Bars 2 is already reviewed in an previous D.B.A. magazine.
On the album are the following songs,

Rockin' all over the World              Mystery Song
Down Down                               Roll over, Lay Down
Caroline                                Rain
Paper Plane                             Wild Side of Life
Break the Rules                         Whatever You Want
Again and Again                         Living on an Island

Most of the songs are well known by at least the old Quo fans.
Although Caroline was often choosen as the best song, i myself prefer the
more heavy'er song: Again and Again.
All the songs are rock songs, altough; Living on an Island is the softest
song on this album.
In the Netherlands Status Quo had a big Fanclub with thousands of
fans everywhere.
But i think there all still some fans left somewhere in this world.......
