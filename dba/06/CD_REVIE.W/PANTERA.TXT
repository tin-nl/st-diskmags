THE PANTERA ALBUM

PANTERA - VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER!            REVIEWED BY TRONIC OF TRONIC PDL
----------------------------------            --------------------------------


I'm back!   Boo!      

I am now going to preview the new PANTERA album.  

This band is one of the best bands I have ever heard!!  Such style!


A Bit about the group:-
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    I would class this band (apart from effing heavy) as very heavy thrash
metal (could even be trash metal?)   Does it matter?   (Quote from Ozzy -

If you like the band who gives a shit what kind of music it is!!!  (- OZZY)

Apart from rave then it is clashed as shit music.  (-TRONIC)

They started life as a rock n roll back or even a boogie band but as you will
find out they have found the decent music and have hit back like a 5000T weight!

Anyway, the lead vocalist is a Texas-American!  His name is Philip Anselmo.
(got a poster of him to the right of me!)  He thinks that Tyson could have been
one of the best, infact maybe THE best, boxers he has ever seem. He said he was
a bad example to other boxers (ie. The criminal activity normally classed as
RAPE, or the best type of sex (- well maybe not?). 
He is not pleased at this. (- pointless info!)


So, in the band is...

Philip Anselmo - Lead singer (shouter!)
Diamond Darrell - Lead quitarist (slightly good this bloke)
Vinnie Paul - Percussion
Rex - Quitarist



On the album
------------

On the album is:-

Side 1                                     Side 2
------                                     ------

Mouth for war                              No good (ATTACK THE RADICAL)
A new level (of confidence)                Live in a hole
Walk                                       Regular people (CONCEIT)
Fucking Hostile                            By demons be driven
This Love                                  Hollow
Rise


This album is like the new Black Sabbath - Dehumanizer (also excellent). In
being that all the song are amazing and they are all the same style but still
have their originality!   It is a bit difficult to understand what the hell
they are saying but are you supposed to???   I think not!  This band is goes
under this famous saying..

                          Either you like it are you dont!

I do and I think the band should have a lot more emphasis on 'em.

You lot over in Netherlands, Germany and such like might not be able to get it
, I dont know, but if not write to me a send œ14.00 sterling (including P&P)
and I WILL send it back to you! 



Now some lyrics:-
-----------------


These lyrics are from the track, Fucking hostile (yep thought you might agree!)

                                -------------------

PROMISE TO NAUSEATE.

ABOUT YOURSELF.
NOT LIE AND MAKE YOU BELIEVE WHAT EVIL IS MAKING LOVE, AND MAKING FRIENDS, AND
MEETING GOD YOUR OWN WAY, THE RIGHT WAY

(CHORUS)

IN TURN, YOU'LL MAKE US FUCKING HOSTILE
WE STAND ALONE
THE TRUTH, IN RIGHT AND WRONG, THE BOUNDARIES OF THE LAW, YOU SEEM TO MISS THE
POINT, ARRESTING FOR A JOINT?!
YOU SEEM TO WONDER WHY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DIE, YOUR WRITING TICKETS, MAN, MY MOM
GOT JUMPED, THEY RAN!
NOW I'LL PLAY A PUBLIC SERVANT, TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE LAW AND THE STATE
I'D BUST THE PUNKS THAT RAPE, STEAL, AND MURDER, AND LEAVE YOU BE,IS YOU CROSSED
ME, I'D SHAKE YOUR HAND, LIKE A MAN, NOT A GOD!

(CHORUS)
COME MEET YOUR MAKE BOY, SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T
ENJOY, BECAUSE OF HEAVEN/HELL, A FUCKING WIVES' TALE
THEY PUT IT IN YOUR HEAD, THEN PUT YOU IN YOU BED.HE'S WATCHING-SAY YOUR PRAYERS
'CAUSE, GOD IS EVERYWHERE.
NOW I'LL PLAY A MAN LEARING PRIESTHOOD, WHO'S ABOUT TO TAKE THE ULTIMATE TEST IN
LIFE, I'D QUESTION THINGS BECAUSE I AM HUMAN, AND CALL NO ONE MY FATHER WHO'S NO
CLOSER THAN A STRANGER
I WONT LISTEN
