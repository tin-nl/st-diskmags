time you're reading this, we'll be probably working our tails off on our
first Synergy Megademo

1.795 m

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Intense happiness and satisfaction of beholding and co-producing real art.
The best way to express my emotions, a great way to meet more people and enjoy
meeting them, feeling useful in life and getting the feedback that 
I desperately need


What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
Most of them lock themselves in a world ruled by hierarchy. Like: 'if he's 
better than me, I'll be nice to him, otherwise I'll fuck him for being lame'.
Why just not respect all real effort? Everyone is special in his own way.      

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
Demo's that show good design instead of having 134 or 150 sprites. But I 
think the ST Demo scene is luckily already going in that direction now 
(Agression, Hemoroids, Equinox, Animal Mine)

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I don't spend much time on playing games. Just Braybrook, Maclean, Crowther,
 Malone stuff please. I don't waste disks and time on 5 lame game compil shit!

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
I really like their products, but that should be quite obvious

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
I already stated something in a previous question concerning this subject, but
I really like games that show good design, gameplay (Paradroid), atmosphere 
(Kinghtmare), a high level of realism (Jimmy White's), graphics (Speedball 2).

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
Will I find a bomb in my mailbox if I tell you I hate it? I think it's growing
totally out of proportion. Hacking feels great, but there are mob-like wars 
going on nowadays...

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
I definitely would

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
None...unless someone shows me a specific article

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
No idea (see previous question)

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
(fnar! dunno!!!!!!)

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
(aaarghhhh!)

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes! that's better...

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Most articles in DBA Mag 4 were not serious enough and written too quickly 
with too many spelling errors. 
Ever thought about editing some texts before publishing the hole thing? 

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
see previous question and for some mags a better lay out and user interface

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
Waiting for the moment that you're having sex with 2 Italian women at the same
time for free

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A person who's really knows nothing about something, but acts in a way that he
invented it, just to be able to communicate with people having the talent 
he'll never have. Note: a humble person with little coding skills is NOT
a lamer!

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
Too bad that a lot of persons who put a lot of effort into their products, get
fucked in a few seconds, because they don't yet belong to 'the best'

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Work harder and you'll be among the best...don't think, don't talk....WORK!!!
