Musician and Literary Consultant are my prime functions. I dabble a bit in
coding.

Weight...                                                           (1 LINE)
73.5 Kilos

Length...                                                           (1 LINE)
1.87 meters (?)

Hair (like color, style or just plain bold)...                      (1 LINE)
Your average marine-cut-brown.

Looks (like playboy, shit head etc)...                              (1 LINE)
Average, I guess.

Clothes (like jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap etc)...                  (2 LINES)
Anything but girls-clothes and baseball-caps.

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
There is always room for improvement, which makes making demos so much fun.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
Very friendly and hardworking people. Excluding the ripp-together-a-demo
types, ofcourse.

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
The element of surprise is what makes every demo special. If I were to decide
what a demo should contain, I would make it myself.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
A good game compilation is a great diskspace-saver. The concept of the actual
menu is a bit worn down though...

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
Great products, lousy distribution and a bit too foggy in their descriptions
of new products.

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
Getting better, though I feel a lot of Software-houses are reluctant to 
recruit demo-coders. Not very smart, considering the potential available.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
I couldn't care less for the 'cut-throat-scene'.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Definitely. Ofcourse the prices would have to be a lot lower.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
I usually browse around in my local bookshop. The magazines I go through are
like ST-Format, The One, etc. I seldomly buy one.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
The game/software reviews are generally very good. When it comes to demos/
partys/demo-coders inexperience and alienation from the REAL computer-world
becomes apparent

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
More articles that could help a potential serious user and a less hostile 
attitude towards the demo-scene. Demo-Coders are NOT crackers.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
No, because it boosts the price a bit too much and they usally contain lousy
programs.

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Very good. It is healthy to use your computer for more than just playing and
demo-watching/creating.
D
o you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Depends on the magazine. In general I would like for a few more serious
articles to appear.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
If I would want to let the world know what my idea of a good diskmagazine is,
I would start my own. 

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
This question, for starters...

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A lamer is a person, who judges something or someone without first conducting
a through and serious investigation into the subject. 

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
The problem lies within the fact that everyone has a personal definition of a
'lamer'. If we were to agree on a definition, the discussion would take a very
positive turn.

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Don't let words get you down. Keep trying and I am sure the effort will be re-
warded. I too was inexperienced, but by staying myself I was able to integrate.

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I bought a c64 and switched the thing on. Everything else is common knowledge..

Good Habits ( like always(?) be nice )...                            (2 LINES)
I always try to listen to everyones opinion without judging beforehand.

Bad Habits ( like bitting your nails )...                            (2 LINES)
I tend to be very impatient and I don't work without proper motivation.
