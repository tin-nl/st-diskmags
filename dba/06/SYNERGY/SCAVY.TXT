quite repulsive,but somehow that seems to attract some people?

Clothes (like jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap etc)...                  (2 LINES)
ripped jeans (natural ripps!),black jean jacket,etc.

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Demos are great,cause it pushes people to put a computer to it's limits,some-
thing that hasn't been done much the last months.The last few demos I've seen
don't have anything new to offer,which really is a shame.........

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
I think some people think that the more people they get in their group,the  
better they'll be..which mostly isn't the case.I won't mention any names,but
I think it's hard to control such a group,and I guess releases will be low..

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
Real games would be nice,cause I hate the walk-around-the-screen thingy's!  
And with games I mean real games..not just a crappy tetris clone or something

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
No,I don't really like them,cause to improve disk space games are packed to
death,crashing at the most inopertune moments...remember Chaos strikes back?
The version I got was on a compil disk...It was more like crash'n'play!

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
They don't support the users enough..If you ever wonder why the PC shit is 
going so good,it's because they have an excellent back-up service...mostly.
If Atari would do they same,the would be on top of the world!

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
no,me not likes tham (nice english eh?).Most games are crap..Sometimes some-
thing good comes out,but that's just 1 per 25 games that's really worthwile
playing !

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
I can start the 'it's killing the industry' crap,but I use it to check out any
new games..If they're any good,I'll buy them anyway (yes I do!)

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Yes ,definitely,but the're isn't that much for sale,and when it is,it's old...

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST Format (not any more),The One

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
St Format had some terrible slaggings on demogroups in general,which really 
put me off..

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
A column which covers the demo scene in a professional way,not the ST Format
' Green balls moving with wibbly chip music crap' way...Fuck them!

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Yes and NO.it would be nice if they put something usefull on it,not another 
Tetris or Pacman Clone...No because it increases the Mag price..Sometimes you
want to buy a mag but not the disk and you have to pay extra for the shitdisk!

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Mostly

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
More articles on S E X !

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
No articles on SEX

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A person who has almost no knowledge of 'the scene' but tries to act like he
or she does and judges stuff he/she sees while not knowing what it means/is.
An example:Nice Disting Rasters! Yes,but it's just colourcycling.....

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
A useless subject..

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Have fun with your Lego kit

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I can't see what me starting with computers has got to do with lamers,but   
anyway,I started on a humble ZX Spectrum (48 K)...Nice soundchip (1 channel)!
