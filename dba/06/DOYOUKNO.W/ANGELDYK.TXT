      (by Ms Angel of the D.B.A.)


    *       Our magazine is more improved now.


    *       Slimer is very busy with writing so
            many articles for the D.B.A.magazine
            because he wants a place in Guiness-
            Book of Records.

    *       Our Ecto 1 was on holiday for two times
            in july, only Spain was not enough for
            for him to come at rest.

    *       Vigo has a nicer car then Bonus at the moment !

    *       Slimer will try to write on a higher level so he has 
            saved for a dictionary.

    *       Ecto 1 has had his 21th birthday at 26 july and for the 
            second time he was not at home that day.

    *       Everybody is saving for a new Falcon 030.

    *       Slimer has a 'coupe soleil' (blond stripes in his dark hair)
            for a few months now and somebody have said: "yes, it is
            nice but when i had that it do not look! Very strange this
            words because he had never a coupe soleil! (????)

    *       You could marry in the caves of Valkenburg (Limburg, the
            Netherlands). Maybe an idea for later?

    *       Our mister Cool is free of army again! Now he has plans
            for to become a journalist in future.

    *       The Dutch movie "Flodder in America" was not a big
            success in the Netherlands.

    *       All Dutch members of the D.B.A. have a special D.B.A
            T-shirt with their own name on the backside?

    *       Slimer tries to get his house more nicer then the palace
            of miss Angel but it is too difficult ofcourse.

    *       Many people have read the article about "Hessel and Miss
            Angel in concert" in D.B.A. magazine 5.

    *       Miss Angel must let the gumpot at home of her driving
            teacher because her shoes are almost be jammed on
            accelerator. 

    *       Miss Angel will always read the articles written by Mr.
            Cool first, before she start reading other articles of
            a new D.B.A. magazine? 

    *       Everythime the goldfishes of Ms Angel die and she don't 
            know why?

    *       And thousand of more.........
