Well I bet you didn't know that...

 - I  got so bored with the NRK that i just put  on  the  first 
   Amityville film.

- I bought a bunch of old classic horror movies i hadn't seen yet at a
  video sale. Even got hold of the good old Phantasm, a great old 
  B-movie that i had been looking for. 

- I also bought the Terminator meets halloween movie Maniac cop II, a
  really bloody affair, they cost me 50Nkr (a bit less than 5 pounds) 
  each, not much if you count movie value in blood.

 
- I still can't get hold of Re-Animator in this country.

- I have been looking for The Thing the last year, but no luck so far
  but i'll keep looking or get round to order it from the Brits..

- This film is rather fun!!! 

- That i saw the third Amityville film a whole lot of years ago and 
  it wasn't that good.

- I just checked the cover of this film and it was made in 1989 so it
  can't be numero uno, its probably number 4 or something like that.

- this is 00.17.08 the 23.may.1992

- this is our computer set up:

   - Dragon 32 :under the table 

   - an to the far left we have an Atari 1040 STF With NORWEGIAN!!! TOS
     1986 model (no TOS in memory when we bought it) and it has a 
     equally old monitor in front of it.

   - Then we have a Star LC24-200 Colour printer

   - Then in front of me we have an Atari 520STE with 4Megs of memory 
     and a extra SF314 disk grinder. It also has a SC1224 monitor which 
     is standing on an antic Solvsuper 10 stereo with four speakers. 
     This machine was bought from the norwegian NDM computer mag when
     it stopped breathing (the banks went paranoid) 

   - Then to the right of me is a A... emh Ami.... well that Commodore 
     compy you know! its a 500 with 1 meg mem. and and Amiga monitor and
     a cheap third party disk destroyer (Amigas eat disks you know) 
     This machine barley survived the first week as i wanted to throw 
     it out the window, i havent yet learned one of those f*** system 
     commands, TYPE!!! i havent bought a computer with a mouse to type
     DIR etc... we got PC to do that on!!! The good thing is that its
     connected to a vid trough Digi View gold. The vid is again connected 
     to a TV that shows Peggy Sue Got Married at this moment. 
     (Amityville finished a while ago)

   - Behind me we have a unconnected mono monitor and we also have a 
     replay 4 pro sound sampler. 

   - Then on my brothers room we have a PC 386 (or something like that) 
     with the normal VGA etc... and he also has a ST 260 that we bought 
     for 250nkr (less than 25 pounds!!!) But it is not operative due to 
     space problems.

- Its hot in here, The sun shins into my room in the evenings and heats
  it up. 

- In the summer the sun shines into my room the entire night, not funny
  mon.....

- The clock is now 21.29.39 the 24.may. 1992

- i just read the didyaknow file i wrote for mag 5 and there was a 
  little error in it, the rusian i mentioned didnt get 6 000 000 000
  votes but 6 000 000, but what's a couple of zeros among friends!!

- i writes these didyaknow files while i watch TV (or vids)

- i saw Robo II last night and it was better this time around, so if
  you didn't like it the first time, see it again. 

- Aliens the Special edition is out now, i ordered it from Akers Mic 
  but they had sold all their copies, so i have to wait till they get
  their next shipment.

- The Lawnmover man, a film based on a Stephen King story goes well in
  US at the moment.

- This film has loads of computer gfx in it as much of the action 
  goes on inside a Viritual Reality machine.

- Its one of the few English movies that makes more money that it cost 
  to make.

- The new Amiga 600 cant use the A590 CD-ROM, not a good sign to give 
  potential CDTV buyers.

- Any CDTV buyer must be a Lamer in the first place so it might not be
  that bad.

- The CDTV big problem is the lack of good software, not one good 
  title to date.

- In Japan they have started a school for CD games  design, so that
  the Japanes companies can avoid the problems Commodore are facing
  today.

- The CDI might not be that good, the rumours have it that there aren't
  any computer on the inside.

- It might just be a sort of book on disk, you might play music, show
  text, pictures and film but that's it! No sprites or bliters etc...  

- If you think Atari moves in mysterious ways, you should take a closer 
  look at what Commodore does this days. 

- I have yet to meet a person that understands why Commodore launched 
  the 500+ and 600 so close in time and why they are as they are.

- The launch of the new Amigas indicates that there will not be any 
  new generation of computers coming from Commodore this year.

- Atari has better plans like Falcon 030, Jaguar and STT. 

- Falcon 030 will be a bit expensive in the beginning but then it is 
  the most powerful computer that's revealed to date.

- It might go on sale in October, more or less the same time as Sony's 
  Minidisk... 

- Falcon + Minidisk = Heaven 

- On the STE you can make a ok Soundtracker demo, on a Falcon with a 
  Minidisk you could make videos for Michael Jackson.

- The only thing missing now is a fully working digital camera.

- Just put Fire & Ice into the vid. Great animation (rotoscoping) but
  they should have used shadow colours like in Akira. But on the other 
  side this film is older. 

- The backgrounds are deadly impressive, but then they are drawn by the
  master of fantasy art: Frank Frazetta

- There's a Jap cartoon called Fist of the North Star out on vid now,
  it has a English 18 years certificate due to the amount of blood that
  are shed in it. Sounds interesting!!

- The Jap cartoon comp Manga has gone America: U.S. Manga has already 
  several interesting video titles out. 

- Jap animators usually targets a more adult marked than Disney. So if
  Akira is anything to go by then this could be fun.

- Talking about Disney, their version of Robin Hood was the first film
  i saw in a cinema, maybe i should buy it for the novelty factor.

- If you are interested in animation then you should get hold of Fire &
  Ice just to see the movement, more realistic than both Akira and 
  Disney. 

- Rotoscoping = Actors plays the sceen, then the animators uses the 
  film as a sketch 

- The animated movie market will probably explode within 5 years.

- The fast advance of computers and Viritual Reality will make the
  cost of making animations close to nothing. 

- with a V.R. suit and a Render prog you could play all the parts 
  yourself and the computer would do all the animation (that's how V.R.
  works in the first place)

- the big American TV companies are very worried, technology is eating 
  their viewers, within 5 years one of the big ones will fall, within 
  20-30 years they might all be gone. 

- Within 25 years most homes will have more picture processing and 
  transmitting power than all the American TV companies PUT TOGETHER 
  has today.

- some TV companies can survive if they turn themselves into data 
  administrators, equal to what a Sysopp is on a BBS, or they could do
  something new, something normal people can't match. 

- In Neuromancer you connects your brain to the TV and instead of seeing
  an actor you becomes the actor, seeing what he sees, feeling what he
  feels, doing what he does...  

- that could be very perverse, 'Freddy Kruger VS Emanuelle' anyone!! 
  What would your christian granny say to that!!!

- But their doomed to loose the news battle, all news will be transmitted 
  live by bystanders. 

- Well i have other things to write so i better call it quits for now.
