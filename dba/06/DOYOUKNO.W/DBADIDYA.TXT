*********************** DID ** YOU ** KNOW ** THAT ************************

This bloody magazine has now it's final big improvements.
Bonus got really crazy after hearing thousands and thousands of times
that we must pack our text-files.
He immediatly began coding after hearing it threethousand times ?

When I said that the scrolling sucked, he really got pissed off !?

He is now on the loony farm, yelling i'm a computer, i'm a computer.......

We got some English people working on the magazine to get a higher quality
of articles.

This is already issue 6 and we are sorry that we made you a bit crazy by
releasing number 4 after number 5 !

We not really mean that !!

Everybody seems to be Metallica fan these days.

I hate Metallica, although i listen to them very often !

I love Hip-Hop, House, Acid, Rap and i never listen to that !

I'm confused, maybe they lock me up with Bonus at the loony farm.

Vigo is dreaming about the Falcon 030 and that we found him on a high
building trying to fly !?

This article is made a long time ago when you read this ( magazine 4 isn't
even released yet ).

We are now a couple of days later in time and i'm continue this article !?

Bonus send me the new magazine ( this one ) but the bloody thing does not
run on 1 meg. machines !

Whheeeee snif snif.

I'm waiting for a new update version now !?

Ecto 1 just returned from his holiday in Spain !?

Mr. Cool is on holiday in Sweden for probably the rest of his life !?

This is a very lame joke !?

Maybe there is nothing happening at the D.B.A. H.Q. !?

I'm bored.

Maybe i must go and watch some video just like Cyberpunk does !?

Bonus bought himself another car ( again ) !!!
This time it's a Renault 18 TS and he seems very satisfied this time.
Do you believe this... ??

K.G.E. has a T.T. now ??
The T.T. had some water damage when he bought it.
K.G.E. managed to fix the T.T. and now he has a fully operating computer !

My bloody utility disk with Tempus and my copy programs on it, just
crashed.
Lucky for me i had a backup of Tempus, otherwise i couln't write this down.

That other preview version of this magazine was send to me ?
It runs perfect, there are only two minor bugs discoverd but that should
be fixed by now.

I seem to have something with the bloody word bloody these days !

On sunday the 26 of Juli i had a visit from Bonus, K.G.E. and Vigo.
Well, K.G.E. showed his TT ( nice ) and Bonus his souped up STE.
Some new ideas came up on our little meeting and i think that most of
them are in this new issue of the D.B.A. magazine.
A said " I think " because i wrote this text long before the release date.
These new features will shure punch the lights out from a couple of other
magazine's !

I bought myself a CD from Yngwie J. Malmsteen called " Rising Force ".
He plays rather good but i find Joe Satriani slightly better, he has
nicer tunes and better melody's !

It's time to leave you folks now, because i'm going to buy a dictionary
( Dutch/English ) now.

I'm back again and it is a view days later ( time fly's ).

Ms. Angel thinks that it is funny to make some horrible remarks about the
D.B.A. members in this corner too.

She don't like to share her corner with other females, well thats bad luck
for her because we have space problems at the moment.

There are to many disk-magazine's at the moment and there are still more
to come.
Don't start one when you have nothing new to offer to the people.
With to much of those magazine around, you get lesser quality issue's !

I'm saving for the Falcon !

We continue on the Falcon !?

We have new members ?? This one guy from the Netherlands who will do music
for us and maybe some articles too !

D.B.A. just started a Division in England which contain two members, who
will do music, articles, spreading and more........

That this Magazine also runs on TT, most of the other magazine's we saw do 
not run on this machine ( esp. those with fancy things like borders removed 
and other kinds of nice looking effects ).

K.G.E. bought himself also another car, it seems to be very fast and has
a blue color ( the rest is secret otherwise the police will arrest him
before he can test the car ) !
Okay, okay, i tell you what it is; it's a Porsche 911 ( Targa ).

I can't even answer all letters in time. 
The amount of money spend on poststamps is getting higher and higher 
each week!
Some DONATIONS would be very nice right now, otherwise i go bankrupt !!!

( One Week later ),

Magazine 4 is already one week on the market.
It contains one little keyrepeat bug but that's nothing compared with the
bugs i have seen in other good magazine's.
Things like: you return to the main-menu but it loops back to the article
you were reading.
Things like: You want to load an article but the magazine refuses to load
it ( the diskdrive does totally nothing ).
Those guys call them selfs top-coders !

If the bug appears in magazine 4, just press a key and it will stop !

It rains, it rains, it rains, it rains, it rains and rains outside !

That we appeard in ST Magazine with our D.B.A. magazine issue 5.
They shure seem to like our magazine over there in France.

( some days later ),

We going to make you really D.B.A. crazy, you are going to eat/sleep/walk
and talk D.B.A. if it's up to us !

Bonus left for Duesseldorf this morning with Synergy and some other blokes.
I just can't wait to hear from him when he comes back on Sunday evening !
I've told him to greet some people for me, i hope he meets them !

Vigo has past his exams in plants and other green stuff.
Well done, man !

I really hate to say this but i'm going to do a course in WP 5.1. !
Maybe i even do DBASE 3+, i don't want to to this but i was forced !
PC's really suck !!

( again couple of days later ),

There was a concert of Guns N' Roses on the T.V. which was very cool.
2 and half hours long, muszaxxxx !!!!!!
Even Lenny Kravitz and some guys from Aerosmith were perfoming something
on the stage.

Currently Metallica is playing on the radio, they really get popular !

I'm bored, i'm bored, i'm bores, i'm bored, i'm bored.........

I have so many things to do but i'm still bored.......

Well i'm going to leave you, time to send my next pile of post away !
