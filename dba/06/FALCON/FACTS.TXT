              SOME MORE ON THE FALCON POSITIVE/NEGATIVE
                            by Slimer

The Falcon has a build in " Modem " with a top speed of 19.200 bauds !!!
All you have to do is put a wire between your Falcon and the telephone
connection( without an interface ).

The Falcon has NO(!) MS-Dos emulator build in, but there will be a hardware
emulators and maybe even software emulator available soon.
Atari has adjusted the Falcon's internal hardware to support better and
faster MS-Dos hardware emulators.
Emulation of a MS-dos machine will be much faster then on the ordenary ST
because the Falcon already has VGA graphics support.
I think that software emulations will become a lot faster too !

When you buy a Falcon you also get some software with it.
There will be a game that uses all colors of the Falcon and there will also
be a sampling-package and a talking clock that will tell you the time.
You can begin immediatly with the recording and replaying of sampled sound
with the sample software.

It's possible because that nice Falcon also got a build in hardware sampler.
The quality of the samples you record can outrank a DAT recorder, the only
thing you have to do is plug a microphone in your Falcon without an interface.

It's even possible to use the Falcon to answer your phone( Fax ).
It can sample the voices of the people that called you and in the near
future it can even reconise the voice of the caller !
There are already compagny's working on software for this !

All these above mentioned features are possible through the DSP chip !!
There are three versions of the chip: 16 bits, 24 bits and an 32 bits version.
In the beginning there was only the 16 and 32 bit versions, the 16 bits 
version is slow and can't do everything what the 32 bits version does.
The 32 bits DSP is very expensive ( F 1200,-- guilders )and is to expensive
to build in a " normal computer ".
Motorola decided to fill the gap with an 24 bits DSP chip and that's the one
that is build in the Falcon 030 !
The 24 bits DSP chip can handle 16 mips and runs on 32 mhz, so this thing
is so fast that you just won't believe it !
Without the DSP the Falcon would be something like a souped up STe computer.

There will be only 3 types of Falcons sold in the shops for the time beeing.
Don't worry there will be other types too but you have to wait a while for
them.

First there is the  : Falcon 030, 1 meg., without a Harddisk   F. 1550,-- 

Second there is the : Falcon 030  4 meg., with an 65 meg. HD   F. 2700,--

Third  there is the : Falcon 030  14 meg, with an ?? HD meg.   F. 3600,--

( Future Falcons will have connections for CD-rom, Tapestreams and more ).

The third Falcon has 16 meg. but uses only 14 megabytes to stay compatible
with the normal ST( two of those megabit chips aren't used ).
The normal ST is based on an 68000 CPU that can address 16 megabyte max.
but the 68030 can address a view ( theoretical ) gigabytes !
Surten programs use addresses that can't be used on the Falcon so Atari has
limited the Falcon to stay compatible.

The Falcon will be more compatible then the TT.
Atari claims that the Falcon can use more ST software then the TT.
We have to see about that, now won't we !?

Atari has given the Falcon the same casing as the normal 1040 STf.
Jack Tramiel says that it was cheaper to use the old ST case then to build
a brand new case with for instance a seperate keyboard.
Why did they not use the same casing as the MEGA ST(e) instead of that lame
STf casing !!!??

Another disavantage is that Atari will sell a 1 meg. machine !
You can't do absolutly nothing with the 1 meg. version, you must have at
least 2 meg. to use the machine properly.
To begin with; you can't use Mint on the 1 meg. version because you will
have around 300 KB. left to use.
Most applications are at least 512 KB, what do you want to do, use 2 copy
programs or something ??
Those nice colour pictures that use thousands of colors will EAT your memory
and they use lots of space on your disc's !
So, you where happy with that 1.44 meg. drive !?

There is one simple solution to this: BUY THE 4 MEG. VERSION WITH H.D. !!
If you don't have enough money you can buy the 1 meg. version and buy a
memory upgrade later !
Don't forget to buy a Super VGA monitor( they are not that expensive )if
you can because it's pathetic to connect the Falcon to a T.V. or RGB monitor.
You will see what i mean when you use the interlace mode on your T.V. you
will get a real headache( like the Amiga in H.A.M. mode ).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first Falcons are now rolling from the assembly-line and will be sold
in October in the shops.
In the beginning the amount of machines will be limited.

I will leave you with the words: The Amiga will not survive this disaster !
