BLACK-MAIL

The Falcon is not even being sold and already hardware manufacturers 
are developing add-ons for it.... How's that for a start..
This text is taken from the advertising given to us at the Atari 
Messe in Dusseldorf.

One of the first items for the DSP connector is a so-called 'voice-
mail' system which uses the DSP to record and playback spoke mail 
messages from and to the telephone line.

This voice-mail system works just like a computer mail-box but with 
spoken messages (voice-mail) instead of binary data..

It's being sold as:  

 -------------------------===============---------------------------

* The lowest priced, full featured voice-mail system in the world

* Incoming and outgoing messages are recorded as digital soundfiles

* Use as a single or multi user system

* Remote, secure access to voice messages

* Message forwarding to other voice boxes, telephones, and paging

* Selectable audio compression rates (1.5:1 up to 3:1) on incoming
  messages

* Timestamps are saved with each incoming message

* Easy to use interfaces

* Available last quarter of 1992 for the Falcon 030 (maybe also for
  the NeXT and Apple Macintosh)

* Watch out for our DSP-based digital audio sampler !
