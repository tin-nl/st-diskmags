JUST BALLS SCREEN


THE JUST BALLS SCREEN FROM THE JUST FUN DEMO PART I !!!!!!

As i promised in issue 4 of the magazine i have here a screen of the Just
Fun demo. It isn't the original version cause it would take to much space
but the main idea and technic is the same.

In the folder GFA\ASM there are three files that if you put them togheter
will form the complete demo.
The files are: JUSTBALL.LST
               PICTURE .PI1
               MUSIC   .THK

The picture and music you must includ in the source.
How to do that ??? Simple, first choose MERGE and load JUSTBALL.LST in
the GFA Basic. The inlines aren't included because it is an .LST file.
If you save it after you included all the other files and save it as 
a .GFA files the INLINE lines won't be lost !.Then go to
the line INLINE letter%. Press HELP and L. The fileselector will pop up
and you can choose the file PICTURE.PI1.
It now will be included. You must do the same with the MUSIC.

After that the demo is ready and you can run it. I hope you like it and
learn a bit of it. It isn't the best demop ever made, okay, but it has some
nice tricks in it. The complete prg is filled with comment on almost every
line so it should be easy enough to understand what it does.

If you have some nice small prg's/demo's or what ever send them in, cause 
we cant do all the GFA listing's !!!

Hope to see some of your work/comment soon until the may the GFA be with you
