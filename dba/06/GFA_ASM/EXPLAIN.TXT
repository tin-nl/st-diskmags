                         Hi everybody!!!

This is the first time that I've sent an article in. I am a GFA-
BASIC freak and I thought it would be nice for all the GFA 
coders to get a rout for opening the low border.
I've originally written this routine for the dutch magazine 
'START', so it's documented in crappy dutch language.
(Note from Bonus: already changed in english !) 

Anyway, I tell you in short lines how the rout works: You install 
a screen of 32000+50*160 bytes. ( 50*160 Bytes extra 'cause the 
screen becomes bigger!) After initialising and turning off some 
MFP interrupts (they disturb everything) you can finally open the 
lower border. First you synchronize the shit with VSYNC and some 
VIDEO ADDRESS COUNTERS ($ff8205, $ff8207 and $ff8209). Then the 
program waits (->> doing other things like putting sprites etc.).
When the electron-beam arrives at the last screenline (200 in low 
res) and is in the right border, you put the sync at 60 hertz. 
And a few cycles later back at 50 hertz. Wooooooow! Holy shit! 
Potverdrie! Nou moe! m'enfin! Daž ist doch nicht war!
The low border is on holiday!!!! (Delta force expression)

Easy eh?

Oh yeah, I almost forgot: you can modify some syncs by pressing 
the +,-, and arrow keys. And the overscan only works compiled!

Thanks to Mr Ni! of the Tos crew for giving me some hot hints and 
helping me with his special (V)sync rout. (This special Vsync 
rout is not included in the routine)

My address can be found in other texts from me. (If D.B.A. has 
included them)
