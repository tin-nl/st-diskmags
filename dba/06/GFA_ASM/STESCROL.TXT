SMOOTH SCROLLING

Smooth scrolling on the STE.

A source, a source etc.... Yeeeeah. Okay enough of this mad crap. Here is
something many people asked us about to publish. So here it is, a small
listing in GFA for the STE, smooth scrolling for you.

Since the STE has hardware scrolling build in we want to use it, the
only question is how. The listing is just a small example of two 
pictures bouncing fron left to right and back. But it is up to you
to extant this listing for your own use.

The listing is on this disk in the folder GFA_ASM in the listings.lzh
file. You must extract it first in order to use it. If you don't know
how to do that read it all in the magazinebox PROGRAMS unter the name
USING LHARC.

Hope you have any use for this small listing, maybe next time we will
make another listing whit more options.
