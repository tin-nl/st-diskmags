The Firato is a big fair where the newest audio/visual equipment is shown to
the public.
Many welknown manufactures are present on this fair like: Philips, Pioneer,
Sony, Bose (buerg), Panasonic, Atari, JVC, Kenwood, Akai and many more.
They all show their new inventions and improvements to the public and the
people of the Hi-Fi shops( who get sometimes special demostrations of the
equipment to persuade them to sell the stuff ).
The many firms that are present have hired famous people to show the new
equipment and to present little shows and games.

I had no time to go to the fair but i managed to get some information about
the new equipment from Ecto 1.
There is a lot of news to see and hear on the Firato and i shall try to
inform you about the most important and interesting stuff that was shown.
Well, i think it's time to get this show on the road,

************************ THE DIGITAL COMPACT CASSETTE **********************

The Digital Compact Cassette ( DCC ) is an invention by Philips and allows
you to play/record on a digital tape.
It's the counterpart of the DAT recorder which was a big flop because you
couldn't record more then ONE piece of sound from a Compact Disk.
The biggest avantage of the DCC player is that it can also play normal tapes
you don't have to throw away your old tapes ( smart move ).
The DCC recorder will standard be equipt with a autoreverse system.
Philips and other manufactures of DCC equipment will try and take the market
by storm with this new system which is cheaper then DAT.
A bit later in this year there will also be portable DCC players and digital
tapes available in the shops.
The DCC will get launched with over 500 titles of many famous artists on 
digital tape to choose from.

There are already DCC players made by: Technics, Marantz, Grundig and Philips.
Philips keeps it a little bit in the family this way because the other firms
are from the Philips concern.
So, keep your eyes open and take a close look when they come to a shop  
near you.
For more information about the DCC and tape prices read the article below
about the Minidisc from Sony.

******************************* THE MINI DISC ******************************

The Minidisc is a little disc on which 74 minutes of music can be recorded.
Both the Minidisc-man and the Minidisc-recorder become available in the shops  
at the end of this year.
The System is very fast, because searching between two tracks takes less
then a second !
It is much like a normal CD player, you can program your own tracks and 
that sort of things just like the CD player.
The machine is shockproof, so it's very nice to take it with you when you
go biking, skating ect......... 
It is possible that you also can store data on it, nice to have a Minidisc
instead of a lousy diskdrive !

There will be 300 titles of music available on Minidisc on the time they
get in the shops.
There is going to be some very heavy competition between the DCC and the
Minidisc.
Both systems have their avantages and their disavantages but i personaly
think that the Minidisc will do better than DCC.

Why i hear you ask, Well the Philips DCC recorder is F 1599.-- guilders and
the Minidisc is F 1200 guilders to begin with.
Although the DCC has a search system just like a CD-player it will have to
wind or rewind to the track you want to listen to.
This takes a lot longer than the Minidisc because this little baby will find 
the track within one second.
The Minidisc is smaller ( just like a credit card ) and very strong and
the digital is bigger and is in my opinion more vulnerable for damage.

Some prices for blank( empty ) DCC tapes and Mini disc's,

One blank Minidisc for max. 74 minutes of music will cost around F 17,--

One blank DCC tape for 45 minutes of music will cost you   F 14,95
One blank DCC tape for 90 minutes of music will cost you   F 18,95

In the future there is a possebility that Philips will make also some 60, 75
and even 120 minutes tapes.
That's surtenly a big avantage that you can keep more music on an 90 or 120
minutes tape then on a 74 minutes( limited ) Minidisc.
Sony claims that if you record 1000,000 times on the Minidisc the sound will
still be perfect !

****************************** VIDEO SPRINTERS *****************************

Do you get sick and tired of waiting for you VCR to rewind the tape to the
beginning of the tape ?
Those guys from Philips have made a turbo-drive in the new VHS VCR's.
Philips claims that it is the fastest For and Backwards rewinding system
in the whole wide universe !( i got a little bit carry'd away ).
The new turbo VCR's also seem to be very users friendly and have a new look.

********************************* HEADPHONES *******************************

The German headphone specialist Sennheiser has made a new and a rather
expensive headphone called: " Orpheus ".
With the " Orpheus " you will also get a digital tube amplifier for the
most perfect sound ( the total distortion is only 0,01 ).
There will be only 300 made of these headphones and they will be sold in
the elite Hi-Fi shops.
All of the headphones are handmade and they will cost FL 23.995 guilders.
That is about 18.000 german marks and that makes it the first headphone
that exceeds the 20.000 guilders boundary.
Before the Sennheiser headphone came on the market it was Sony that had the
most expensive headphone( made of wood from a rare tree ).

********************* SYNTHESIZER WITH MUSIC PROCESSOR *********************

How about a synthesizer with 2000 different sounds in his library.
Featuring, 2 expandeble effectsfiles, with a 250.000 events-sequencer and
with a master keyboard ( 32 midi-channels ) !
The thingie comes with a memory of a 1.6 MB Hard-disk and a diskdrive with
which you can store new samples, sounds and sequences on the Hard-disk.
This monster is more like a worksation then a music-instrument !

You can choose between the S2( 61 keyboard ) or the S3 ( 73 keyboard ).
They are touch-sensetive keyboards, what do you want more........
This keyboard is made by General Electro Music ( GEM ) and is displayed
on the Firato !

**************************** AUTOMATIC PILOT *******************************

Next year all the Dutch Television programs will get a special signal that
functions as a start/stop signal for your VCR.
This signal gets send with the Teletext signal and is called: PDC.
PDC stand for; Program Delivery Control and helps you with recording your
favourite programs from your Television.

It works like this: You choose your own fave. program and the VCR knows
through this signal when it must start the recording and when to stop.
It doesn't matter if the program is broadcasted a little later, the VCR
knows when to start recording ( quite a handy feature ).

Your VCR must be equipt with a Teletext decoder and the PDC switch !
Live is sure getting better and better through all these neat features.

***************************** CAR-TELEVISION ********************************

Casio has invented a LCD Television that you can put in your car.
The T.V. works the best in area's without many houses/buildings.
You can recieve the signal via a special car atenne and you must connect  
the T.V. to your car-cassetteplayer( it has a special accu adaptor ).

It works also with your camcorder, you create a car-cinema that way.
Nice to keep your kids busy when you have to make long trips.
Although i think it's quite dangerous because you can't drive and watch
T.V. at the same time ( or can you ? ).
