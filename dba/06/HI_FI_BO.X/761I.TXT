                         INTRODUCTION

In D.B.A. magazine number 3, you could read about several loudspeakers.
Among those loudspeakers was the Mission 761, a very good and low priced
loudspeaker.
Products are always improved and changed and this is also the case with
speakers ofcourse.
Mission decided to improve the 761 a bit, giving it two woofer speakers 
and one tweeter.
They gave it the same look as the successful 760 speakers, this means that
the front cannot be removed ( maybe with a screwdriver ).
It is one solid box, it's a cheaper option then removable fronts.
They are also a little bit smaller then the old 761 speakers.

                          BOOKLET

The nice speaker comes with a discription booklet with everything in it you
must know.
It says how you must connect and place your speakers and it gives you
handy tips.
I saw lots of speakers, but there were not many manufacturers that also  
provided booklets with them !
That's one point already........

                          IMPROVEMENTS

Okay, everybody can say that they improved their products, but are they
really that improved as Mission claims ?
The Mission salesman says that they are great, but who believes an salesman
anyway these days.
So, the guys from the local Hi-Fi shop gave me the new speakers to test them
coz' i had already tested the old 761 speakers !
Goodie, goodie.......I throwed my old speakers through the windows and 
connected the new ones and placed them on the speaker-stands !
CD in the player, amplifier on, volume up and play..........

                          THE TEST

HHMMMM not bad, not bad at all, they shure are playing nice.
Much detail in the bass and a fine stereo balance.
I got very enthusiastic, they sounded really much better then the old 761 !
The stereo balance was brilliant, you could easly hear from which direction
the different instruments are coming from.
You can hear the second woofer very good and it gives the box the sound
of a couple of bigger speakers.
This is going to be another success for Mission, who sold lots and lots of
the cheaper 760 speakers( they had very good test's ).

                          CONCLUSION

Great stuff for a nice price, really worth buying if you are searching for 
top-speakers and you have a low butget !
