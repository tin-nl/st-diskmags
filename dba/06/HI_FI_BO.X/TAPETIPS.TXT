In issue 5 of the D.B.A. magazine was an article about Compact Disc's.
Well, i hope you found it useful and if you did than there is some more
for you.
There are still people on this planet who think that tape's are just as
"indestructible" as the Compact Disc.
This is ofcourse not true and most of you know that too, but for those
who do not know that.........

1. Always put your tape back in the tapebox after you used it.

2. Never put your tapedeck to long on pause, this can lead to dropouts
   in the music right on the place where the play-head stopped.
   The playhead stay's in one place to long and can demagnetize the spot
   where your play-head or recording-head touches the magnetic tape.

3. If you got an older type of tapedeck which doesn't use an IC controled 
   system ( with old push buttons ), you always must push stop before you
   press another button.
   The tape will stretch a bit when you press the for instance rewind
   button while the tape is still playing.
   This will give you nice dropouts in your music( it's sounds like a tick
   in your music ).

4. Keep your tapes away from very hot area's, like full sunlight or in your
   car where the inside temperature can reach over 50 degrees Celcius !
   The stuff is made of plastic, so figure this one out for yourself.

5. Clean your tapedeck often, this prevents dirt getting on your tape.
   Don't forget the tapedeck in your car, because this one is often
   forgotten by people.

6. Keep the tape's away from magnetic-fields and dust.
   Do not touch the magnetic tape itself with your sticky fingers !
  
7. It's always good to keep al your cassette's well protected in those
   boxes who can hold 32 or more tapes.
   Be shure it is a good and solid one with a lock on it, it's practical 
   when you take your tapes with you on a trip.

8. If you are not going to use your tapedeck for a long time, remove the
   tape('s) and put them back in their box(es).

9. If you've got an expensive tapedeck with a very good recording-head your
   tapes hold the recorded sound much longer at a same quality level than
   an cheap tapedeck.
   The tapedeck will have a stronger magnetical head that puts the sound
   with much more accuracy and power on the tape. 

10. If you follow all these rules, you will keep your tapes longer in shape.
