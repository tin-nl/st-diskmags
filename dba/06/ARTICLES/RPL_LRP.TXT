RLP and LRP that stands for roleplayin and live roleplayin, is very popular
here in Sweden. For those who don't now what Im talking about I'll give you
a shorth explanation what this is.... Roleplaying games are games when you
create a character in a futuristic or fantasy invironment. This character
is what you design it to be! Intelligent or stupid, strong or weak or slow
or fast it all up to you to create as God ones did! Well this character
among with some other player characters will under the gamemaster "the 
dude who have full control of everything surrounding the characters" will
try to survive one heavy adventure after the other one. And so the players
characters will develop and get new skills and so on. All this takes room
in the players imagination with a little help from maps and dices. To play
is to be in a movie where you are the superstar trying to slay the dragon
or the wicked witch. If you don't like sitting inside you can play live 
roleplayin which you plays outside with fake swords fake bows and fake 
armors. This kind of roleplaying takes more planning but its really fun..
So why don't you try it and judge for your selves. For you who want an 
roleplaying corner just write to the following adress....
