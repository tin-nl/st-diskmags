                              BBC SELECT
                              ----------



          
               The future of British television is coming to an 
     end, or is it?  Since the arrival of SKY TV, many british 
     housholders have been purchasing these products to improve 
     their range of channels. Other products are also coming into 
     the light of day, which include: CABEL TV, BSB TV AND BBC 
     SELECT.


               Though one of these products is turning out to be 
     a ripoff, and that product is tending to become BBC SELECT. 
     This is a ripoff because of these facts:

     1.You already pay the BBC for the programmes that you watch. 
     2. You have to buy a seperate decoder.
     3. When you purchase BBC SELECT, you dont get any other 
     channels.
     4. You can only use BBC SELECT from 10 PM to 5 AM. 


                  Though these are the most common disadvantages 
     of the BBC SELECT system, there are also others. But from 
     all of this, the BBC SELECT group assures of better 
     programmes on their SELECT system. But by now, surely the 
     BBC knows that the British public won't believe that the BBC 
     SELECT system wont show repeated programmes over and over 
     again like they always do.  


              I, myself, can't really see the BBC SELECT system 
     taking off all that well. I think that the main reason that 
     the BBC are developing this system, is to induce old 
     customers back to the BBC so that profits will go up. I also 
     think that the BBC are trying to compete with SKY TV. To be 
     really fair, they haven't got a hope in hell. Because SKY TV, 
     is a lot better. This is because it offers better channels 
     such as: EUROSPORT, SCREEN SPORT, LIFESTYLE, SKY ONE, MOVIE 
     CHANNEL,SKY NEWS, SKY MOVIES, SKY MOVIES PLUS and last but no
          means least, my favourite.. MTV.  Somehow I dont think 
     that a puny 1 channel system can match this. Do you? There's 
     also a little added bonus to SKY TV. If you know the German, 
     Sweedish, Norwegen, and Dutch languages then you can happily 
     watch RTLV etc.. without getting to confused.


               So all I can say to the BBC for the moment is: Add 
     in another 15 or so channels and I'll think about it!
