In response to Mat's computer myth file in last issue,  here  are 
some strange things that have happened to me or my friends.

Radio GaGa:

My first computer,  a Dragon 32, hadnt the best sound chip in the 
world,  but it was good for one thing,  it transmited its signals 
on a wave length you could pick up on the radio!  My  x-neighbour 
Dizzi  Tunes (Public Enemy) of Imagina used to turn on his  radio 
to  check out if we were playing any good games,  if so  he  came 
over to have a go.


Swed  .00000006

On  one  of  the schools i went on we  had  some  swed  'Scandis' 
computers.  As on most other computers there were a spread  sheet 
prog.  I  and another member on Network (amiga owner) had  worked 
for  two  hours  and had finally got  our  calculations  to  work 
properly  and saved the sheet to disk.  Next week we  loaded  the 
sheet  back  in to continue the calculations,  but all  the  sums 
were  wrong!!  We loaded up other versions but no,  all  versions 
were wrong.  So in the end we did the entire sheet again and made 
sure everything were 100% right,  we saved the sheet to disk  and 
called it quits.  But our teacher heard that we were finished and 
came over to check it out,  so we had to reload.  And guess what, 
it  was Wrong again!  After a looooong bug hunt  we  accidentally 
turn  of  the  comma  limit  and  the  screen  was  filled   with 
x.00000006.  The standard PC sheet added .00000006 to all  values 
when it was saved from the swedish computers!    


Intel I486 external internal 

Due to low sale of the I486 chip Intel decided to make a  cheaper 
version to get the sale going.  So did they find a way to make  a 
'cheaper'  chip?  NO!  They  simply  disconnected  the  on  board 
mathematical  chip (it is embedded on the same silicon  sheet  as 
the  rest of the I486) This 'new' chip costs the same to  produce 
but  it is slower so they have to sell it  cheaper!!!  And  guess 
what!  you  can upgrade it to a full I486 by buying  an  external 
math chip and connect it to a spare slot on the side of the 'new' 
I486. You then have a I486 with a disconnected internal math chip 
with a connected external math chip!  This costs more than buying 
a standard I486!!! Anything for logic.


 
Though 3.5 

I  Once  made some gfx for a never to be Amiga  game  called  The 
Tube.  The  programmer of this game got a shity game from one  of 
his contacts,  in frustration he threw the disk out the window of 
his second store house.  The disk landed in the garden and as  it 
were autumn the disk snowed down. The following spring on the way 
to  his  school he noticed something,  that  reflected  the  sun, 
lying among the last patches of snow,  the reflections came  from 
the metal hatch on the disk,  he picked it up and put it into his 
pocket.  When returning from school he put it into the drive  and 
to his amazement the game still worked!!


Pang your dead!

While  i  served my king and country i had my Amiga  with  me  to 
do some gfx for that Tube game (My brother had to have the ST  at 
home to keep up the swaping) I used the amiga with a old portable 
TV that had a strong static field.  One day i were sitting  there 
blasting some comies to kingdomcome one of my room mates  entered 
the room,  seeing what i was doing he walked up to the screen and 
pointed a finger towards one of the characters on the screen  and 
shouted  'Pang!  your dead!" (in norwegian) at the same  time  he 
did  this  a clearly visible blue charge of electric  power  went 
from  the  screen to his finger and the  amiga  immediately  went 
blank!  One  of its parts was electrocuted and i had to  take  it 
home for repairs.


Copy my protection 

One of my friends bought a ST and got Buggy Boy with it,  as this 
game  were  rather good we tried to copy it.  But  no,  the  game 
identified  the copy as a copy,  so no luck.  On the disk were  a 
prg  file  called Copy lock (or something  like  that).  Starting 
this  prg we got a message claiming that we newer would  be  able 
to  copy this game.  Well we gave it our best shot and  used  all 
the  copy  progs  we had,  but still no luck.  The  next  day  my 
brother  got a bit irritated on that Copy lock file and  in  pure 
anger he dropped it into the dust bin (yes the standard GEM  dust 
bin)  and guess what!  the copy of the game now  started  without 
any problems!
