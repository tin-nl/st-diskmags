                    UPDATE OF F.A.S.T IN ENGLAND
                    ****************************


         For the past couple of months F.A.S.T. have been 
      moving to prosecute more people on the copying act. 
      F.A.S.T., the Federation Against Software Theft, are 
      warning companies to be alert to cheap computer packages, 
      that are sold at computer auctions. 

        This action takes place, because of a prosecution 
      that was made to a liquidator, who was supplying computers
      with illegal software at various computer auctions. 
      Trading standards officers seised some hard disks which 
      were contained illegal software. 
        
        The liquidators were charged under the Trade 
      Descriptions Act 1968, and also the Copyright, Designs and 
      Patent Act 1988. The liquidators pleaded guilty to the 
      charges that were brought against them, and they were 
      charged a total of œ4,314.60.

        F.A.S.T. is now supported by over 200 members from 
      the computer industry, from each of the majour software 
      companies to the small computer industries.

      

        F.A.S.T. is not only catching up with the frauds of 
      the computer companys, but also the frauds of normal 
      computer users. A source has said that an ST user was 
      caught selling pirated and cracked software. The ST user 
      was found selling his software at a car boot sale. He had 
      around 300 disks full of pirated software. The software was 
      seised by F.A.S.T. and the ST user now faces prosecution.
