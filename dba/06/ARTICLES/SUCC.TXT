SUCC MEETING

                    SWAPPING UND CODING CONFERENCE 1992
                    -----------------------------------

SWAPPING UND CODING CONFERENCE (SUCC) was the only copyparty held in
Finland this year. The date of the party was 10-13.8.1992. Nearly all
well-known Finnish crews were there. X-TREAM, CHRONICLE, AGGRESSION,
ADMIRABLES and UNIVERSAL CODERS were the best teams, but also some
smaller groups like FLASH (it's us!), CONDEMNED (they released a new
megademo) and AMF were on the show...

The whole party was very small (only 30 people), but the 'spirit' of
it was great... All the days were quite the same: coding, composing,
painting, copying and drinking (mostly beer). You really couldn't
sleep much, but when you have an opportunity to meet other ST-dudes
in Finland, you really don't want to sleep...

There were at least 3-4 previews of new demos, but only CONDEMNED
managed to release their finished demo. But soon we are able to see
(I hope) demos at least from CHRONICLE and X-TREAM. And maybe there
will be a slideshow/module-disk from that party.

The place itself was good. It wasn't very big, but for 30 people it
was quite enough... On the last evening there was a sauna (it is a
Finnish place, where people are naked...), and I heard a rumour that
there was a video-camera taking pictures of these naked people. Hmm?

Food and drink was cheap and good. So I can't complain about this
subject.

All in all it was nice to meet the people that had been my contacts
but I had never seen before. Also I got a couple of new contacts and
copied some new stuff (there was amazingly much new stuff)...

I just hope that there will be another SUCC in next summer (it is not
so sure, 'coz ST-scene is very small in Finland)...
