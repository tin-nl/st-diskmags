                      THOSE WHERE THE DAYS 


November 1983 Dragon User 

A US Showcase for the Dragon

The  world of the Dragon seems to keep growing.  Here on  the  US 
front,  I  see some different things than Dragon Users in the  UK 
do.  For instance,  this November the first Colour Expo is  being 
held.

......This  convention has certainly received  some  high-powered 
backing.  The  mayors  of  both Los  Angeles  and  Pasadena  have 
proclaimed  the weekend of the show as "Colour Computer  Weekend" 
in both cities. (beats shooting blacks any day. CP)

....   The  Three-day  event  will  also  have  a  special  panel 
discussion on software piracy...



Disk Drives: how they measures up

....  Both  consist  of  a  ROM  cartridge  containing  the  Disk 
Operating  System,  which is linked by ribbon cable to a  double-
density single-sided drive offering 170K of storage space.

Black box hits pirates

Buyers  of a new Dragon game (buzzard Bait.  CP) will  also  find 
inside  a  black  box  about the size of  a  matchbox.  It  is  a 
"Software Key", designed to halt piracy.

Managing  director  (Microdeal.  CP)  John Symes  said  the  box, 
containing  unmarked chips,  plugged into the  Dragon's  joystick 
port and de-encrypted the game. He said "It will cut out 99.9 per 
cent of piracy."

Buzzard Bait's author,  Steve Back (Robocod etc.. CP) was sent an 
encrypted copy and asked to decode it.  Mr. Symes said: "He spent 
tree days on it and then told us: 'Forget it.'"

(The  game was a good version of Just,  actually better than  the 
ST version, but due to the box it used 10 minutes to load. CP)


Amstrad's New Micros: all the Details 

All the new computers have a green screen or colour monitor,  64K 
of  RAM,  32K  of  ROM,  a Z80A processor  running  at  4MHz,  74 
typewriter-style keys - including numeric keypad - and a built-in 
cassette player or 3" Hitachi-style disc drive.  
 
(The  Amstrad succeeded because they had taken time to produce  a 
whole range of games that were launched with the machine. CP)

The Family house that Jack Built

As you might expect the  microcomputer scene is avidly  wondering 
what Jack Traimel will do next.  Nowhere is there more concern on 
this topic than within commodore,  which Jack built and left this 
February.  One question now answered concerns what Traimel was up 
to  from February to July - He was travelling extensively in  the 
Far  East,  setting  up manufacturing facilities  and  recruiting 
investors for his new company Traimel Technology Inc for which he 
raised  about $75 million.  He then picked up the stricken  Atari 
for a song and is back in the US micro battle.

Enterprise Arrives....

Specs : Price        249.95 pounds 
        Processor    Z80 
        RAM          64K
        ROM          32K
        Storage      Cassette
        Display      Max text 84*56, max graphics 672*512, number 
                     of colours 256
        
(The  Enterprise (or Elan) should have been released in 1983  and 
cost  199 pounds,  it would probably wiped the C64 and ZX of  the 
map without any problems and thereby changed computer history  as 
we know it. CP) 

Coleco  (Matel)  gives up the computer world so no more  Adam.


Atari gets tough over software rip-offs, Zany Kong junior, Wonder 
Warlords and Castles of Gems are withdrawn as they looks to  much 
like  the  original  Atari Donkey  Kong  jr,  Joust  and  Crystal 
Castles.

Amiga's arrival pressures Atari

Commodore  looks set to launch its Amiga Computer - a  rival  for 
Atari's ST nad Apple's Machintosh - on July 18, in the US.

(This was the 15 minutes Amiga,  the Max time it took before  the 
operating  system crashed the computer.  But the quality  of  the 
hardware were far beyond that found in the A500. CP)

A  view  to a kill hits the computer screen the 7th june  as  the 
first James Bond game in computer history.

Deja  vu  and Little Computer People are shown  in  Chicago.


And thats it for now,  Maybe we should take a trip back into  the 
ST's  history  at a later date (I have to dig up some  old  Atari 
mags first). But now! The end is here......
