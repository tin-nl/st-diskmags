Yo ST user! I want to thank D.B.A. to use this article for their 
issue number 6. I wrote this article because of some crews who crack 
all games to be the best.I think it is bad for the coders because 
they code for nothing. I'm in one of the best leading crews in 
FRANCE. Some of our members received some phone calls from some 
Ocean'coders and they told us to stop cracking their games. We 
understood their message and all crackers of BASTARDS INTERNATIONAL 
decided to crack EPIC, PARASOL STAR etc. about 1 month after. And we 
have been waiting 1 month and we are not dead. But the problem is 
that FUZION made one version of EPIC 2 days after. So pitty, they 
wanted to prove that they are the best cracking-crew in France. I 
wanna touch all crackers of the ST scene. STOP CRACKING the game 2 
days after, the game must be bought. If all cracking crews does the 
samething than us, the ST scene will never die. The coder of Ocean 
will create the best game never realised in the world.
