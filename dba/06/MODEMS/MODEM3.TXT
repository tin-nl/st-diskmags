MODEMS 3
                      The World of Comms Bulletin
                      ---------------------------

           With Dave Malins (the modem freeeaaakkkkk!)......
           --------------------------------------------------

Hello  and  welcome  to  another  edition  of  T.B.B.BBS.    In    this 
edition  I am going to  explain  to  you  my  ideal  BBS  (sysops  take 
note!)...And then I'll nominate the Better British BBS Award.

                The Ideal Bulletin Board/Buyers Notes
                -------------------------------------

POINT NUMBER 1
--------------
To  begin  with I think that each and every BBS should  support  a  the 
major  baud rate's.  I have noticed recently that a lot of  Sysops  are 
starting to drop 75/1200 V23 baud rate ,  now I know for a fact that  a 
lot  of people have only got V21/V23 baud modems and if a  BBS  does'nt 
support  this  rate  then a majority of people are  losing  their  most 
powerful  protocol.  I  know its a bugger to work with V23  modems  but 
please remember,sysops, you are then losing a few users , eh???


Buyers Note :> If you are about to negotiate  about getting a V23 modem 
               stop right now!  Don't waste your money!  A lot of BBS's 
               are   stopping  using this  protocol ,so  you  would  be 
               spending pointless money.

Spend money on a modem which supports the following protocols :>

        V22     - around œ90 
        V22bis  - around œ100 - œ400
        V32     - around œ300 - œ500
        V32bis  - around œ400 - œ1000 
        HST     - around œ600 - œ1000


POINT NUMBER 2
--------------
I      think    everybody      would   agree   that  friendliness  is a 
major point for a BBS & its sysop ,  for a start ,  if your a  beginner 
and you are having a problem with either your modem or working out  how 
to use the BBS , the sysop must be able to explain CLEARLY your problem 
without any sarcasic or offensive comments , like :

QUESTION >'How do I download software?'

SYSOP    >'Oh for gods sake,are you dumb or something?  You go to  the 
           download area and select what software you want you idiot!'

This actually did happen to me ,  when I first logged onto my first BBS 
the sysop gave me an answer a bit like this (I'll not give you the name 
of the Board , it'll just create hassles).
The answer should be like this :

SYSOP    > Ahh well,what you do is press key B for the downloading area, 
           then  select what programs  you would like.  Then  you  chose 
           your downloading  Protocol  (XMODEM for instance) then  press 
           RETURN. Your software should arrive shortly after , okay? 

This  would  help a beginner get started ,  would'nt  it?  Rather  than 
pointlessly slagging the modem user off (you know who you are)....


POINT NUMBER 3
--------------
Now  I  know  you sysops are under a lot of pressure  to  upgrade  your 
hardware with extra hardrives and things , but there is a few points to 
be made about your BBS Software as well.  Right ,  when you log-on to a 
BBS you are likely to be posed the following options :>

1> INTRODUCTION TO *&$œ*& BBS
2> HELP
3> CHAT WITH SYSOP
4> PD SOFTWARE
5> etc
6> etc
7> etc......

But  with  a  lot  of  BBS there is one thing missing : The CHAT MODE's
I am  only satisfied fully with a BBS if it has a one-to-one chat mode.
Now  I  know there is usually an option to chat with the  sysop  ,  but 
would'nt  you agree that the sysop could get just a little  pissed  off 
with you wanting to chat with him AGAIN! I like the BBS's which support 
one-to-one  chat  mode's  because  you can  have  a  conversation  with 
different  people  every  time.   Its  really  satisfying  spaeking  to 
somebody  who is probably about  800 miles away!  I'm not  saying  that 
every BBS should get something like this ,  but sysops ,  would'nt  you 
aggree  it would be an invaluable asset (probably quite costly too!)  , 
it would certainly increase your users list I can tell you!  


POINT NUMBER 4 (god what a demanding guy I am!)
--------------
I think everybody will agree with me here as well..BBS's are design for 
you to get a hold of that latest PD Game or Utility aren't they?
Well  I've found that a lot of BBS's have got really dated  stuff  ,  I 
found archived away in a BBS System the old utility FCOPY 1 ,  christ , 
FCOPY 1???  That was brought out years ago!  Come on BBS's get your act 
together , even if it means getting a few PD Utilities and stuff from a 
PD Library!  Mind you , alot of BBS's in Britian , Sweden & Germany are 
very up-to-date with their software , good for you guys! Everybody else 
take notes........

POINT NUMBER 5
--------------
Graphics? A lot of BBS system's just use Ascii text  as  their  display
format ,what about :
Viditex,Ansi,UBT & Instant Graphics????. I know also that these graphic 
formats were created to be used on different computers such as IBM's or 
PCs  but how come programs such as Freeze Dried Terminal support  these 
graphic formats??  I don't know much about this subject , but If Freeze 
Dried Terminal can use these graphic formats on an ST ,  could'nt an ST 
operated BBS use these as well?   (Somebody correct me If I'm talking a 
lot of bollocks , though)....

POINT NUMBER 6
--------------
Piracy.  Who  in the hell could be as stupid as to create a  BBS  which 
lets  you download the latest cracks?  I know its done ,  coz their  is 
alot  of BBS Numbers in demos which have Piracy Lines on  them.  Please,
please , please , please , please , please , please , please , please , 
please  ,  if you are a sysop of a piracy line stop now.  For your  own 
good  and  the  good of keeping the ST & AMIGA alive stop cracking  and 
packing software and sticking it in a BBS.  It'll soon be the day  that 
BBS's will be made illegal because of Piracy Lines ,  and only services 
such as prestel and Compuserve will get all the users  (and the dough).
I know that 20 quid or more is expensive for a game ,  but please think 
about  what  you  are doing...Over 10  software  programmers  have  now 
stopped  creating ST games ,  because basically the market is very  low 
because of crackers & packers latest CD Number 12345. We want the ST to 
live  a good life of more than 20 years ,  instead of the 7  years  its 
been in production for.  I mean ,  you piracy BBS's are contributing to 
the downfall of this lovely 16 bit machine you are looking at in  front 
of you. Why don't you just go to a decent computer shop right now , and 
buy a game for a change. You'll feel much better doing it , because you 
will get a colour manual , maybe a poster and one or two ORIGINAL disks 
for you to boot in your drive. It makes me feel good buying my software 
because  I feel I am contributing to the up-keep of the ST.  A note  to 
crackers  as well :  Why don't you write demos instead of those  crappy 
CD's  you  like  to call them.  A demo  will  get   software  companies 
interested in your work , rather than being distgusted with your crappy 
menus  and shitty CD's that you pour out every second of the  day.  And 
you'll feel much better creating a masterful demo than simply  cracking 
games ,  packing them and shovelling a menu onto them.  You'll get more 
contacts , friendly letters and lots of fan mail , and not this kind of 
message I am telling you guys now.  So please , please stop. Discuss it 
with other members of your 'crew' , and start to create a demo , change 
your 'crew' name , change your handle and get codin'.......!
