Hello  again guys!  Yes it me ,  the immensly  intelligent  modem 
freak here to guide you through another bout of not  so technical 
information on the world of ST comms.........

Well  after  the last doc I did on comms ,  I seem to  have  come 
across  more hardware and software for review.  Of course if  you 
are enthusiatic about joining the thousands of modem users across 
the  world  you will need a good insight into what  hardware  you 
want!  This is the purpose of this new section in the D.B.A  disk 
magazine  ,  which will hopefully turn into a regular  section  , 
if I get support from you readers though!

                    LATEST MODEMS & HARDWARE
                    ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Anyway  lets  start  of  with a new  exiting  peice  of  hardware 
available from a company in England.  It is called the Smart  One 
Modem  which  is basically a 2400 bps modem with a 9600  bps  Fax 
built  in!  Built  by  Best Data Productions LTD  this  peice  of 
hardware  is definately something to contemplate buying!

If  you want a Fax machine this is certainly a great  buy as  the 
hardware  comes  with  a  ST  compatible  software  for   sending 
Faxes.This  package  is called STraight Fax and  is  basically  a 
page  sender.  You will have to prepare text on a word  processor 
such as First Word,  or STWriter.  Either this or you can scan an 
image (scanner not supplied) and use this.  Then you can send  it 
to anywhere in the world. Even more  exiting is the fact that the 
software allows you to receive faxes! Yes , the software converts 
the  sent image into an ST compatible file such as .IMG or  .PI3. 
ready for printout!
 
                           VERDICT--> Certainly an immpressively
                                      cheap    modem/fax   which 
                                      does    live   up  to  its
                                      expectations.   A  bargain 
                                      Buy!

can easily wrap it round your finger! 

This  program  is Shareware and you are odviously asked  to  send

Well here we are at a new part of the comms section.  Yes  ,  its 
the world famous 'Great British Better BBS' awards! In each issue 
of the D.B.A disk Mag ,  we are going to award one Bulletin Board 
the  'G.B.B.BBS'  award for their services.  This  month  we  are 
giving our award to :-

           BATH BBS - Bath,Avon,England. --->0225 840060<---

This service was given the ASP Approvement ,  ST Shareware Author 
Support Award and is a division of Bath Publications.  The reason 
I  enjoyed being on-line with this BBS is simple ,  its  friendly 
environment. It had loads of stuff to do including downloading ST 
FORMAT  cover disks ,  Demos ,  Utilities & games.  I also  liked 
being  inside  a BBS while other users are using it at  the  same 
time!  There is also a great chat room in which you can speak  to 
the  other users on-line...Its great...!  If you have a  Modem  , 
good  comms software (VanTerm ,  Freeze Dried Terminal) then  get 
on-line to this Bulletin Board which is operational 24hrs...



If  you  want  to get in contact ,  or if you are  an  BBS  sysop 
wanting  Free advertisement in STATE 808 PDL Catalogue Disk V5  , 
or if you have any  good  comms  software  which  you  would like 
reviewed, send your disks to :
