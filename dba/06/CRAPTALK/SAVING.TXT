What you will read at this moment is really nice. Believe it or not but
what i ( miss Angel ) say it is true! There is in the Netherlands a 
group of people who have founded a miser club. Yes that is true. That
club has now about 200 members. All of this members tell eachother
new tips to save their money. No it was not direct the intention to
save money but to save electricity. These tips are good for our milieu.
They have give them self the name: "miser club" because they knew other
people should say that to them yet. When miss Angel read this article 
about them i got a good feeling. Some tips are very good but many
were really exaggerated!
Read all the tips and have your own opinion about it. 



*       You can use a tea-bag more than one time, so hang it on your
        clothes-line to dry and use it again.
*       Save your bread-crumb and cake-crumb for the yoghurt.
*       Buy ten pairs of the same socks, so when one sock is threadbare
        you do not throw the other good sock away!
*       Make gifts for the birthday of everyone you know.
*       Read every newspaper to find things what do not cost so much
*       Do not phone someone but write that person a letter. It is a
        lot cheaper!
*       Sticks new backsides on cards which are used yet, so you can use
        these cards again. Really cheap!
*       Do not use the warm shower anymore but take a cold one. 
*       Go to a hairdresser where you do not get a cup of coffee and the
        price is not so high than a hairdresser which is very expensive
        and where you can get a cup of coffee. ( you can save a lot of 
        biljets of ten guilders ).
*       You can take a shower in darkness! ( scary ? )
*       If you want to go to the bathroom to shave, wash or brush your
        teeths do this without using any light, this will save electricity.
*       Cut out of your old tablecover nice serviettes. 
*       Do not give your girlfriend a bouquette of flowers but a brench
        of the garden. ( ms. Angel: not every girl likes that ).
*       You can feel more better and more happy when you have bought
        a new sweater of the second hand store.
*       Do not use a lot of shampoo a little bit is enough.
*       Do not use to much toothpaste a little is enough too.
*       Do not drink Spa red anymore. You can better fill some bottles with
        water and put them in the refrigerator.
*       When you have a car sell it and take the train. 
*       You should not buy a newspaper but you can find one in bus or 
        train ( It is free! ).
*       Wear the second hands clothes of your mum or dad.
*       Do not use your lights but do that on a very romantic way.
        Your girlfriend will like that really much. Use candles!
        ( really very romantic and ms. Angel likes that a lot too !! ).
