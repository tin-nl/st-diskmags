                        IT'S ALIVE !!

A woman from Amsterdam bought her self a new Eiderdown( bed-clothing ).
It's a real Eiderdown filled with feathers from ducks.

She goes to sleep under her Eiderdown but when she wakes up in the morning
the Eiderdown is lying in the corner of her bedroom.
Well, maybe i kicked it off in my sleep she thinks, so she gives it no
second thought.
But every night the same thing happens because every morning she finds
the Eiderdown somewhere else in her bedroom.

After 4 nights she really gets a bit suspicious( who can blame her ).
Than on one morning she see's the Eiderdown move on the bed !!
She gets the Eiderdown and goes back to the shop where she bought it.
The shop-keeper is suprised by the story of the woman and they both
decide to take a look inside of the Eiderdown.

The man takes a knife and begins to make a big hole in the Eiderdown.
When he does that, thousands of MAGGETS come crawling out of the Eiderdown
because the featers still had some flesh on it from the ducks.
The people who have plucked the ducks had done it to rough, the flesh on
the feathers attracted flies( well you can guess the rest ) !

                        JOLLY JUMPER,

Some tourist's drive with their car on a road in Australia.
Then suddenly a Kangaroo ( Skippy ) jumps in front of the car and the
driver can not prevent hitting the poor animal.
The tourist's get out of the car and find the Kangaroo on the ground, he
seems to be dead.

When the tourist's recover from the crash, one of them gets out his 
photo camera to shoot some pictures of the animal.
Then the tourist's decide to take some photo's with the animal and they
place the poor animal against the car.
It's all very funny and one of the tourist's begins to dress the Kangaroo
with his jacket and they place a big hat on his head.

The tourist's have a good time and they laugh when they see Skippy in
the jacket and with a hat on his head.
Skippy is not dead but was only unconscious, so the Kangaroo opens his eyes
and jumpes to freedom, still wearing the jacket and the hat.
They never saw the animal again, that was bad luck because the jacket 
contained the car-keys, money and a couple of passport's !!!!
