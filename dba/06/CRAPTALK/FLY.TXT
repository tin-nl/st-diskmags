People are trying to fly for century's but the only manage to fly with help
from machine's.
There is no one on this planet that can fly without a machine apart from
Superman ( but he his from the planet Krypton ).
But the solution to this problem is found by sciencetist's from the
flyfree foundation.
They came to the conclusion that if you think that you are a bird the
mind thinks that your body can really fly.
Okay it's complicated, the mind must be fooled, the only way to that is
to life like a bird does and feel what a bird feels.
Here are some practical tips,

1.  Eat birdseed and go sleep in a tree, standing on one foot.

2.  Get yourself drunk and try Tip 5.

3.  Stick feathers in your ears, think about a Atari Falcon and jump from
    a high skyscraper singing Pink Floyds: Learning to Fly.

4.  Tie a rope around your big toe, tie the other side to a high bridge
    and jump down while you flap with your arms.
   
5.  Try Tip 2.

6.  Get some L.S.D. and you really gone fly !

7.  Stop eating for 8 weeks and you will be light enough to get blown away
    by the wind.
    Don't do this without good medical advice by an doctor from Soedan in
    Africa.

8.  Pump your body full of helium and stick a burning match in your ass !

9.  Steal eggs from a mad Eagle and laugh to the birdy...........

10. Take an overdose of L.S.D. and you will probably get a white dress and
    some nice wings on your back !
