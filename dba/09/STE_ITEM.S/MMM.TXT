             (The Multi Marmalade Mixer Experience)


Finally it's ready the first (and the last) HEMOROIDS ICELAND demo.
The last, yes because this is also their goodbye demo. But that only 
counts for the ICELAND part. As they say it they can't handle the 
pressure of working in a group like the Hemoroids and they discovered 
that demo making isn't suited for them. Okay everybody has his own 
beef, let's see what they made this time...

The demo comes on one disk. It only runs on 1 MB STE machines, so 
people with STF or STM will have to depack the MOD's and listen to 
them with a X or PRO TRACKER. Packer used: Seems to be somekind of 
Hemoroids packer cause the header is HMD!. But okay we are getting on 
a side track...

Put the disk in and start your STE. The first thing you will see
is the flag ofcourse. After that the most famous word makes his 
apperance on the screen saying "LOADING". After that the second most 
famous word makes his presents saying, yep you guest it,UNPACKING.

After that you never know what happens, so I'll tell you. The music 
starts, one of the 10 Mod's. A picture fades in, not much colors, not 
much design, fit's with the music though. A small story is told and 
then the scroller starts. Below you can choose a mod by pressing the 
arrow key's up and down and return to start the choosen module. Well 
and that's about it....

WHAT ????, yes  no what, it's a module demo, no fancy plasma's, bob's 
borderkillers or whatever. Just enjoy the music. These music's are on 
the disk. HMD is what the makers said of it, BS is what I thought of 
it (Personal opinion!):   


An endless world  - HMD: The only tune composed just for this demo.
                         it was made only a few days from the release.
                    BS : Easy start, after that a rather good number.
                         The song is building up a bit keeps you 
                         intrested.
     
Santagum          - HMD: This song is replayed in wrong speed...
                         and gets the 1st price 4 the diskfiller comp.
                    BS : Bit strange but also relaxed...(although)
                         I heard both version by accident slow version
                         and a turbo version. I prefer the slow one I
                         think.

The Elimination 1 - HMD: An old and boring tune. One of the two disk
                         fillers(they said so themselves !!)
                    BS : Well just a diskfiller really.

The Elimination 2 - HMD: Made quite a bit later than Elimination 1
                         and under great influence of Jarre. 
                    BS : This one sounds a lot better then number 1 more
                         variations, good catching tune

Blinded by faith    HMD: This enchanting tune is probably one of the
                         more mellow tunes ever composed.
                    BS : Another very relax tune, but quite good.

The great lost      HMD: Mostly done long ago. But fixed a lot lately
                         and here is the saxophone version.
                    BS : Although I really can't figure out that sax
                         it an easy tune again. Very strange sax but
                         get this small demo and judge for yourself.

Out of time         HMD: An okay mod made for nothing special...
                    BS : This one has finally got some speed in it 
                         but is getting slow again. There is a lot
                         of Jarre in this song that's for sure. As
                         you are listening to this song you will say
                         "There is something familiar here".

Magical spell #2    HMD: The orginal magical spell was written by AJT
                         This is no remix, just a sound alike.
                    BS : It may not sound special it IS. Somewhat
                         strange catching beat and tune, especially
                         the good beat...
    
Magical spell #3    HMD: Dedicated to DURI-17 for saving me under
                         rather bad circumstances !!
                    BS : This one will get you in a h*rny mode if
                         aren't already. Relax man let the flow go...
    
After all we tried  HMD: One of many tunes made for our dentro...
                    BS : If the dentro had been as good as this music
                         it could have landed in the charts high !!

Overall ??? Well I think the modules are okay but the rest I am sorry 
It could have been a lot better (Maybe with GFX from DURI-17 they 
would have saved a lot !!). Giving my vote, I would only vote for the 
music and that worth a good 8, if you like relax music.

Good luck to you guy's in the future, especialy Reflex (ex DURI-17)
