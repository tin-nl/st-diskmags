THE DEATH OF FLASH


Welcome to this new article by  SANDMAN  of  ANIMAL MINE. Yep, I'm the
ex-member of FLASH, but as you may  have  seen  in the news of DBA #8,
FLASH is dead nowadays. But what  is  the situation of all the members
of Flash now, when we are living the last days of April 1993?

DRAGONSLAYER... hmm... he's totally out of the business... I can't say
anything else about him!

EXECUTIONER has sold his STE. He's not a member of any crew, but he'll
buy FALCON as soon as possible.

EXTERMINATOR has joined CHRONICLE.  He's  now  their official swapper,
and he still operates on ST/E. I  think that his work in CHRONICLE has
started quite well, so all the luck to you, EXTERMINATOR!

GOZER was THE musician in FLASH. Now  he has joined KRUZ! So he really
found a good group for  himself.  In  my  opinion the musician was the
only thing KRUZ really needed.

OBSERVER (musician)  and  TOLKIEN  (artist)  joined  a  very promising
Finnish band called PROPHECY.  Nowadays  PROPHECY  is dead, but nearly
all the members have joined GIANTS (at least this is what I've heard).

SANDMAN (it's me) has now joined -ANIMAL  MINE-. I am the only Finnish
member of that well-known crew, and  I  must  admit that I am proud of
it... My job consists of coding and swapping. I still work on my ST/E,
but I'll propably buy FALCON very soon.

So, that was it... FLASH is dead!  One moment in time has just reached
the end (just kidding!) and I'll hope that all the ex-members of FLASH
will make good careers in their new groups...
