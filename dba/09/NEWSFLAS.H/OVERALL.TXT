-- The Jaguar game console will be a 64 bit machine based on RISC
   technique.
   Atari is actually working together on the project with.......
   I.B.M. !!
   The price will be around 200 Pounds or close to it.
   You can read all about it in the "Hardware" corner !!

-- Atari seems to be doing good on the stockmarket, prices of the
   shares have gone from 1 dollar to 3 dollar.
   This rise of value is caused by the Jaguar !

-- The first Falcons seem to have some faults.
   One seems to have something to do with the harddisk when a partition
   is full.
   Atari seems to have solved the problem in the new ones.

-- The development Falcons have sound and heat problems.

-- There is a patch program with the first Falcons to solve the sound
   problems.

-- Many members of the Dutch Scene have obtained a Falcon.

-- The first Falcon cracks are already circulating through the illegal
   circuit for some weeks now.

-- Atari sells all Falcons they export to the different country's.

-- The firm also tries to push the one megabyte version of the Falcon.
   We actually hoped that this would never happen.

-- You can buy the machine with and without                  ~elf.bl2~
   a 65 MB Harddisk.

-- You can't even use MultiTOS on the one meg
   version.

-- Please don't buy this machine, because if
   it sells good we all must do it with one
   meg programmes.

-- Support of most ST (paper) magazine's is very good
   now we are waiting for Falcon only magazine's !

-- The first rumours about the new case for the Falcon
   are that the thing would be black and it looks like
   a PC case !

-- I'm sorry to say however that there won't be a new cased 
   Falcon 030 but only for the 040 machines !

-- You can buy a Falcon without the 65 mb HD, this is a
   good option if you want to buy a bigger Hard-Disk
   with it !

-- The last news on the Hard-Disk front is that Atari will
   build 80 MB Hard-Disk's in the Falcon's for the same
   price !!

-- A German firm has already made a case for the Falcon.
   The case costs 199 DM and has a graphic card build in.

-- Rumours also go about 32 Mhz 68030 machine's that are going to
   released at the end of this year.
   Well don't count on it for the first 8 months or so.
