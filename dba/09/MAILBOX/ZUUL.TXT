Be polite !

Zuul wants to say, especially to Bonus, that the lame problem|ZUULZUUL
with the intro never sent for your DBA Mag was not our fault.|LZUULZUU
                                                             |ULZUULZU
Not totally we'll say...Because the ones in Zuul who promised|UULZUULZ
that intro live in Belgium and aren't in our group anymore...|ZUULZUUL
                                                             |UULZUULZ
We live near Paris and what they say to DBA never came to us,|ULZUULZU
excepted for the 'F* you Zuul' notes in your fave disk mag..!|LZUULZUU
                                                             |ZUULZUUL
Well !!  Noone can really say at the first time that somebody|LZUULZUU
will become like a lamer by a never finished work or screen !|ULZUULZU
                                                             |UULZUULZ
We think that it is what had arrived to you, Bonus, and we're|ZUULZUUL
really sorry for that ! These guys did a quiet good job in da|UULZUULZ
LAMETROP -see yourself in the reset screens not JSW nor STIX-|ULZUULZU
but they bought a PC -no Falcon!- and left Atari we heard ...|LZUULZUU
                                                             |ZUULZUUL
As ZUUL doesn't want to have any problem in the future,and to|LZUULZUU
keep the ST scene as clean as possible, we want you, readers,|ULZUULZU
to think about the uselessness of the 'Fuck you' sentence ...|UULZUULZ
                                                             |ZUULZUUL
FUCK YOU isn't a good English sentence. We should all say for|UULZUULZ
instance GO AND FUCK YOU. Why being so rude and bad educated?|ULZUULZU
Why not yelling GO AND FUCK YOU, PLEASE ! It'd be far better!|LZUULZUU
                                                             |ZUULZUUL
Yes, PLEASE might be the right term for that... Don't we feel|LZUULZUU
pleasure as we FUCK ? No ?! So why not saying FUCK, PLEASE !!|ULZUULZU
It wouldn't sound cleaner ? What about PLEASE FUCK, you like?|UULZUULZ
                                                             |ZUULZUUL
Yeah ! PLEAZ FUCK !! sounds great ! ... And PLEAZUCK ... No ?|UULZUULZ
FLEAZUCK !! sounds better, but is not so good English spoken.|ULZUULZU
Then FLEAS UK ?!  FLEA SUCK ?!!  COS FLEE ??!!...COFFEE ??!!!|LZUULZUU
                                                             |ZUULZUUL
Hey! Man!  What a tremendous insult !!  COFFEE... PLEASE !!!!|LZUULZUU
                                                             |ULZUULZU
                                                             |UULZUULZ
Now you know that being polite is the best insult we have ...|ZUULZUUL
( JOVIS stroke back with a little Monty Python alike speech.)|UULZUULZ
                                                             |ULZUULZU
