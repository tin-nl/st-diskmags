  This single-disk dentro needed about 6 months
to be released on April '93...
  But what we don't know is that the musics are
home-made productions and really unpublished ones.    xXx
                                                      X!X
I made the tunes in a very big and long work !        X!X
With - 41 minutes of listening time,                  X!X
     - 674 patterns ( ! )                             X!X
     - 500 Ko only for the score                      "X"
I bet it's a never seen record...
                                                      xXx
                                                      "X"
Yes, the 'BIG DEMO' from TEX had more listening time,
but the musics were slower and very looped conversions !!

In the 'LAMETROP' the instruments are less (!) good ...
Although there is some buzzing bass sounds, the quality
is not as good as the ones in Mad Max' oldest voicesets.
 Why ?   Three reasons :
1. Mad Max (and the others later) has great noises 'n' drums !
 > Insigna editor's one (used in the LameTrop) are shit ! 
2. Mad Max has better wave notes !
 > I couldn't use them only by pressing and waiting the sound
   because I wanted upto 8 channels without any arpeggio !
3. Mad Max makes his musics clear !
 > I have put the tempo two and often four times faster than
   all the tunes we hear even now !  (A big work !)
   That's why you often hear some very short blip-blop sounds
   in my musics.  Forget them and count the channels !

Adding that the musics are 'synchron' with the screens,
 you'll understand that ZUUL (and I) did a good job !


You want to know how to separate a voice into more (5?) channels ?
Like me ?!  You'll have to work  V  E R Y VERY VeRy very hard ...
But you can!
I haven't got the time to explain all these tricks, sorry !

But if you want to  then rip my -tiny aah!ah! -  muzikz !

Remember:  Insigna TSS_6 is really NOT fantastic !
         Try to use it like me ( speed: E ) or get another tracker !
                                              You know which one ...

(This song is played by a SCOREFILE readed in real time !)

Let's imagine we're on this fabulous machine...
We edit the file in this marvelous 1120 x 832 PostScript Display...
And then we listen to this real CD quality music !

Even if this tune doesn't give -16- voices  at the same time,
and represents only a little sample of what is able this DSP,
I think the FALCON  will not be better  than the NeXT, though
it'll use some good easy tracker...  But try to make me lie !

I can't imagine a better sound than the one I heard on the NeXT.
               ( I compare with the KORG M1... )

          DSP is great, FALCON too, the BOTH surely !...

                But the NeXT still be the best !
              Look at the Phaleon Giga-Demo intro.
                    (from Next of course.)

/* THE LADY OF TWILIGHT - by Michael McNabb  ( Just an extract ! -jovis- )

   This score demonstrates the use of the wavetable-interpolation instrument
   DBWave2vi, and the wavetable-database FM instrument DBFm1vi.

   The singing voice accomplishes smooth slurs by panning between
   wavetables while performing a glissando.  The transitions use the
   portamento feature, which causes envelopes to procede directly to the second
   point of an envelope when a new noteOn interrupts a sounding note without
   an intervening noteOff.

   The 'cello sound uses frequency modulation to add timbral expression to 
   the otherwise-static 'cello wavetable, primarily during the attack and
   swell portions of the notes.

   Feel free to copy and modify this example.
