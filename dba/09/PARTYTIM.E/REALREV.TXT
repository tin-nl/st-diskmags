PART ONE - A TRIP TO BREDA

After a shower, and more than 10 hours of sleep, I'm back O.T.M.
of the D.B.A. doing his part of the Innovation Party in Breda.
On the way back to Steenwijk in Bonus's car we came up with the
idea to write a review on the party, and when all our reviews
are finished they are joined probably by Slimer our great editor.

So let's do what they told me: write a review. As a "fresh" member
I have never been to parties, and I didn't know exactly what to
expect, and I cannot compare this party with other parties. 

I couldn't be in Breda over the full three days because I had to 
work fridaynight. So when I came home Saturdaymorning I went to 
bed, and my mother woke me up at 11 o'clock. I had told her my
train left at 12 o'clock and I had to shower first because else
I'd smell to much like polypropen, and polyethen (plastics).

So at 12 o'clock I was at the train station in Steenwijk, and 
at 12:15 I left to Zwolle. From there I took the train to Roosendaal
after checking if it stopped in Breda. After having sat in the train
for almost three hours I had reached my destination.

PART TWO - ALMOST PARYTIME

So I was in Breda but what next, before I could do anything next
I had to go to the toilet first because I couldn't hold my water 
any longer. After founding it for almost more than a quarter of
an hour I went to search for a cab to drive me to the party.

When finally a cab stopped I was the first of four people and 
there only drove three cabs in Breda so we decided to use the cab
by all of us. So there we sat, and when the cab-driver asked where 
I would like to go to he looked a bit weird, He told me he had
never heard of a club with such a name. I thought by myself:
"Heb ik dat weer!!!" which roughly translated means that I always
have some trouble. 

The cab-driver told me he was new on the job, and he had to look
it up on the map. When looking on the map he seemed a bit puzzled.
But he got of and went to the club-building. After arriving at 
the street we only saw an old building covered with grafitty.
I got a bit worried there for a moment, but when he got closer
I saw the car of Bonus. So I finally got at the place.

PART THREE - THE BUILDING.

When I walked up the terrain which was covered with mud and pools
I thought by myself:"Jesus Christ what a mess, This is going to 
be a long week-end." 

I arrived at the door and a sign said:"Innovation Party knock to 
enter" So I did (which was totaly useless) and  I entered the 
building. When I entered the room I was a bit shocked: it was
totally against all my expectations. It was clean, it had a 
beautiful bar, and a billiards-table in the centre of the room.
But there where not so much people in this room, and there
where certanly no computers in this room so I decided to go to
next room. When I opened up the door I heard a lot of noise,
I saw a lot people, and a lot computers. At first I had adjust
to the complete new situation, Wingleader spotted me immediatly
and greated me fastly and then went on with his doings. When I
saw Bonus and Slimer I went directly to them. They where still
busy with the real-time article, which had his delay due to some
internal lazyness problems.

PART FOUR - BREDA.

When I had finished writing for the realtime-article I went to 
Slimer who was playing Street-Fighter II on the SNES. He invited
me to play some games, and I did. I didn't do so well at first
but this was due to the fact that I never had played, the game,
and Slimer had to practice the day before. When still playing
Bonus told us that he soon would go into Breda to do some shoppings.

A few moments later we (Bonus Slimer and Wingleader of Synergy and
ofcourse me) sat in Bonus's car and went of to a shop they had 
terrorised the day before. Wingleader and me where teasing each
other with some verbal-violence during the trip, and Slimer was acting
like a female radar. Wingleader now and than looked up when Slimer
almost was crying and then Wingleader was giving some comments at
the females.

When having done the shoppings we left to the Mc Donalds to eat
a word, sorry a bit. I'm still going to the docter to check on
my stomach coz of the junkfood they sold us there.  After this
intermezzo we went back to the party.

PART FIVE - THE PARTY.

This is the only part on which I cannot write much about because it
was just in one word GREAT !!!

We had much fun behind the computers and the consoles. Just doing 
weird on good music, and having a lot of fun kicking and breaking
bones and backs in Street Fighter II. After a while I realized
I couldn't be a crack in this game, because you cannot play it
with a logical mind. You just have to press the buttons
and see what happens. Each time people where playing the game
you could hear them say "What did I do","How did I do that",
"A Fuck I thought you where dead!!!!"

So as you see we had a lot of fun over there!!!

PART SIX - THE PEOPLE.

Everyboy who was there were very friendly, there was hanging a good
sphere. I met a lot of people who didn't know me but nobody made
a problem of that. 

Some of them just asked my pseudo, and did like they knew me
for a long time, which gave me a very comfortable feeling. 

There are even a few people with whom I will attend to keep some
contact (you guyz you can expect a letter from me in a few weeks
(I think))

PART SEVEN - THE END.

But now I'm home, and I am still recovering. The docters told me
I will never be the same, but who cares I'm happy in my own way.

I'm looking forward to the next Innovation party which will be
held next year also in Breda. (Frans ik hoop dat je alles zo
voor mekaar kunt krijgen zoals je zei, en ik zal ervoor zorgen
dat ik dan het hele weekend mee kan maken.)

Before I end this text I would like to thank the people who
made this party possible and to the people who made this party
as good as it was.
