MULTITOS BY JMS

did ya know that it is real cool to edit a text with MultiTOS and
Edison Editor ? YOu got the text window right beneath the Desktop
windows and you can have a resolution  of REAL 800x280 or 800x560
interlaced on RGB Monitor. And even  boostable  to 256 Colours or
even Truecolour. When you do not  believe it, than  SUCK MY DICK. 
Falcon makes it possible !  The very astaunished and happy jMS/AM

Okay now here it comes: the MultiTOS praxistest !  We  gotta have
MultiTOS 1.02 from 16.2.93 and a Falcon030 with 4MB RAM and 60 MB 
Harddisc and a normal RGB Monitor plugged up to the RGB connector
Now we cheat a little in the desktop Info and we got overscan with
768x256 or sumthing like that ! Now we set the Frequency to 60 Hz
with Bootconf, and now we use the wondeful FS to patch the screen
to our ordinary RGB Monitor and so we adjust it right and push the
Monitor to it's limits a bit, and than we got ca.800x280 and than
we use the Desktop's Screenresolution box to do Interlace and 256
colours. So we got the Hardware ready (You gotta do this only one
time, ofcourse) When you dislike interlaced... Fuck you, buy a VGA
monitor ! okay, now we start over with multitos. We take the MTOS
Disc and start the install program ! Now We set the path to what-
ever we like, but NOT to the one Atari preset :-) Should be easy!
Okay now we edit MINT.CNF and GEM.CNF so that we use the programs
we like most ! Our favourites ! And now we can reset and look- 
everything bombs up ! Shit ! We take the multiTOS CPX and switch
of da fuckin' memory protection ! Aah , every runs well ! So let
us see what programs we have inda memory now ! We take PSCONTROL
V .. erm, I don't know.. And it says that... We have running (Now
here comes the Tasklist !)
         Name       ID PRI FL  CPU   Bytes
         MiNT        0   0 20    2     160
         AESSYS      1   0  1 1232  562400
         SCREEN     20   0 20   29    1824
         NEWDESK    21   0 20    7  167504
         FCLOCK     22   0 20   12   15360    
         XCONTROL   23   0 20    1   62720
         EDISON     24   0 20  122 1263504
         PS_CONTR   26   0  0   38   34624
         
Now we should have how much memory ? Let's load a calculator !
Argh shit, just deleted it from harddisc ! Okay, Edison says
we got 977 KB free ! Cool ! Let's see which performance let SYS
INFo Show us ? It's an old Version which do not support Falcon
That will boost the performance a bit (hehe =;-> )
Okay, no speeddown from this point ! Now let's start with a tiny
little paintprogram ! What about Truepaint which runs quite
well... And than we will start gemview also ! We have now
running Selectric 1.03 and Let'em fly 1.19 in the Autofolder and 
FCLOCK 1.14 and Xcontrol as accessorys. i just recoverd that
the Edison screen blanker do not work quite well, it doesn't
clear the stars, but no shit on screen anyway. loox cool !
Okay now we do it ! Let's start Truepaint !
Yeah ! Loaded without any problems ! We have now running the
Desktop, Edison, PS Control and Truepaint ! Let's open a screen
and paint a bit !
Works quite okay, but some mistakes ! Now let's load a PC1 Pic!
Yeah ! about 12 Windows opne no prob. From other applications!
Now let's depack sum huge grafix with Gemview while painting with
truepaint ! but before we must have more mem ! We have to say
Edison that it shall only take about, erm, 500 K !
Okay, 264 did it also ! Till now everything worked stable ! We
will now load gemview ! I hate this nerving shareware requester,
but now it's alright ! We will load a 304 KB packed GIF Picture
in Highres with 256 cols ! And while depacking we try to paint 
a little pic with truepaint ! Let's do !  Speed is slowed down
extremely ! I feel like with GEOS on C64, but worse: Truepaint
messed around with the gemview screen and now you can see the
gemviews screen... Wow ! gemview's finished, but out of memory!
Only 291 KBytes are aviable. To load, depack, and the gemview
specific formatchanges it took us 1.42.5 minutes ! So this try
failed ! All in all Multitos is quite nice but too slow and for
daily use not that good ! But I can also do it with a singletask
system, but multitasking is nice ! ou know, I type this text, I
can paint pictures and all this ! And i have the full desktop
functions ! but speed will rapidly increase when you do it non-
interlaced iwht "only" 280 and with "only" 16 cols, which is 
more than enuff for GEm applications ! And when you use the NVDI
for falcon, every problem will be solved ! We hope for the
phuture !

Now I will remove MultiTOS and Interlace ... Phew ! :-)
Oh, forgot sumthing ! We will test the GEMVIEW iconify function !
I load gemview and click on iconify, like in windows ! Not cool
enuff... You got an eye symbol in the upper right part of the
screen but you cannot move it, and it hides the half of my "F"
Partition.. Oh, have i told you lately ... When you load multitos
you have Pipes at the Drive "U" ! Cool you can pipeline to every
drive and/or every application ! And you got a devices folder and
controller like on amiga ! Cool stuff, dude !
Quite nice is also that the new multitos (1.02) handles the screen
resolution switch right ! The former versions had problems ! but
shit is that you have to quit every application before changing
the rez ...	And again, we hope 4 da phuta !
