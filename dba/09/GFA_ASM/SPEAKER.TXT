FALCON SPEAKER

                   The Internal Falcon Speaker 

                               or

                 How to rape sound at his birth

Take a 68030 CPU, a DSP chip, a blitter, put them together in a case 
and call it FALCON. Say that it can show marvelous pictures and hock 
it up to an VGA screen and dribbel. Show it speed and let him draw 
fractals and people start to smile. Let them hear sound through the 
great internal speaker and you NEVER sell a Falcon again !!!!!!!!

DID YOU EVER HEAR IT ?????? IT'S AWFULL, HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A 
THING. Selecting superior parts and then choose a tweeter to produce 
the 50 Khz sound. The best thing you could do is take a screwdriver 
and pop it out !!!. But that would invalid the garantee so what to do 
now ?????

Simple, just put the internal speaker to rest by using these small 
hint's.

In GFA Basic it looks like this:

  VOID XBIOS(30,&H40)    ! speaker off

and if you must turn it on again try,

  VOID XBIOS(29,&HBF)    ! speaker on

and there he is again.

Easy enough, but it was one of the first thing I didn't as soon as I 
had my Falcon installed. So okay you can use the Control Panel to 
lower the volume, but if you don't have a harddisk you will have to 
boot with the installation disk everytime. And that takes a lot of 
time since booting up isn't one of the fastest thing to happen.The 
sound always is wide open, to wide, cause the small speaker can't 
handle such an amount of power and start to deform every bit of sound 
he get. But now you can listen using you stereo or headphones by 
putting in the lead in the HEADPHONES socket and this is much better. 

Hopefully you can use it, until next time...
