THE ATARI BOYS


Did you know that:(by HEAVY G and VOICE)

We live in the Netherlands in a town called Amstelveen.

We own five ATARI's
1 ST(4MB)
1 STE(2MB)
1 800 XL(256KB)
2 LYNXes(yeah)

We're saving all our money to buy a FALCON and a JAGUAR.

We've got 1 coder,1 gfx man and 1 person who tries to do gfx and 
msx.

VOICE  isn't  helping  me with this article he is pressing the 
mousebuttons right now so I've got to kick him.

We're three brothers.

I've got 27 LYNX games and VOICE 6.

The LYNX is really better than the lamegear and the shameboy.

Commedore is really fucking up their new amiga(heh,heh,heh)

They got scared by the FALCON and they decided to put a  DSP 
in the amiga 1200 wich than will be called amiga 2400.

People  are angry at commedore because they just bought  an  A600 
when  the  A1200 came and just when they bought the  A1200  there 
will be an A2400.

If I was them I would drop commodore and buy a FALCON.

The JAGUAR is a cd based machine with a 64 bit riskprocessor

You  should be able to buy an adaptor for the JAGUAR so you can 
play LYNX games on it.

The JAGUAR should beat the 3do of electronic arts.

Nintendo and sega are selling shit and you people believe the 
lies in their advertiesments and buy that overpriced shit.

You should buy a JAGUAR instead of nintendo and sega shit.

It's the 5th of May 1993 and the sun is shining.

Robert is playing Fire and Ice.
Oh boy he's a bad game player.

There are too many ms_dos users in this world.

People actuely believe that intel makes good processors.

Intel  processors  are designed for civil servants  because  they 
work so slow too.

I'm always argueing with ms_dos users at school.

I try to make them buy a FALCON.
 
I have almost got one succes in making somebody buy a FALCON.

He's a games freak so I'll try to make him buy a JAGUAR too,when it
is released.

The FALCON presetation at the fair in Utrecht wasn't so  good,but 
there  were some great FALCON demos of the RESPECTABLES and  some 
others shown.

The  price  of  the FALCON has already decreased  with  50  dutch 
guilders.

Sony  is developing a new CD wich can store 45 milliard bits  per 
inch.This is about 8 days of sound on 1 CD.(about 92 Gb)

This would be nice as a CD_ROM for the FALCON.

There are more articles by us in this isseu(if they're placed)

I don't know much anymore.

You can speed up your LYNX up to an amazing 24Mhz.

You can built in a joystick connector into your LYNX.

There are rumours about a lamegear converter for the LYNX.

The LYNX is superior to the lamegear so it could be true.

The  LYNX  can't  produce shitty graphics so  there  will  be  no 
shameboy converter.

It took me three tries to solve DRACULA THE UNDEAD on the LYNX.

Robert finished SHADOW OF THE BEAST on the LYNX within a week.

I'm adicted to PINBALL JAM on the LYNX.

You must buy a LYNX.

When  you did you should get a subscription of the  INTERNATIONAL 
LYNX CLUB 

The  INTERNATIONAL  LYNX CLUB afdeling Nederland nog  meer  leden 
wil.

Ze bijeenkomsten houden waar je lekker met z'n allen kunt LYNXEN.

This article is really worth reading so I quit.

This is the end.
