Personnal comments from me:
--------------------------
As you all noticed Metallica almost win everything,it's a good thing coz
they're really an excellent band.The only thing I regret is that many 
people discovered them thanks to Nothing Else Matters.And I do think this
song is not the summary of Metallica's possibilities.All these guys should
try to listen to Master Of Puppets album to be sure of that.
The second remark is that Guns N' Roses are starting to fall down with 
their caprices,just see Axl Rose in the sex symbols women part !!!
That's all ...

GUNS N' ROSES:
-------------
Back in the USSR.On Saturday 22th May,Guns N' Roses will play at Moscow.
It's the first time that an international band is able to do their music
there.4000 persons are gonna hear the Gunners !!!
In France,they won't play at Paris,but at Grenoble !! I really start to 
love the place where I'm living (after Metallica,Def Leppard,Ugly Kid Joe,
Iron Maiden,here come the Gunners !!! ).
With in first part:Soul Asylum,Brian May and Blind Melon;it'll be the 8th
July.
I think you all noticed that Slash played with Mickael Jackson in the song
"Give it to me".We know that GN'R had become a commercial band with the
2 Use your Illusion albums,but now we're totally sure of it.
How could Slash have some pleasure playing the shitty solo Mickael Jackson
gave him ? It's so short,so slow ... well ... I really regreet Apetite for
Destruction !

IRON MAIDEN :
------------
The two new albums come with a bad news:Bruce Dickinson(vocals)is gonna 
leave the band just after their Tour in Europe.He wants to have more time
with his family,more spare time,and he'll consacrete more work on his solo
career.
"It'll be very hard to remplace Bruce.I have not lost only a musician,but
someone with whom I spent the best years of my life."
                                            Steve HARRIS(bass).
Anyway,the band is not going to split,becoz they still have lotsa 
motivations and they can't live without doing Tours,concerts ....
But who will be the singer of Maiden?(don't worry,not Paul Di'Anno!!)
Well,they think about Mickael Kiske of Helloween,Ronnie James Dio,Rob 
Halford(ex-Judas Priest) ... Nothing is sure for now so if you have a 
great voice,just pass the audition !!! 

SEPULTURA:
---------
The thrashers from Brazil !!!
"Sepultura is neither Thrash,nor Death or Hardcore,it's all that at the
same time.Our possibilities to improve are by that very numerous."
                                               Max CAVALERA(guitar)
In 1992,they were on tour with Ozzy Osbourne,they launched a live video:
Under Siege,and Max Cavalera had a son called Zion Graziano.
The guitarist and Alex of Fudge Tunnel will release something together by
the way.
For the one who doesn't know this crew,it's composed of:
Max and Igor Cavalera,Andreas Kisser,and Paulo Jr. 


Bye,

  Thomas.
