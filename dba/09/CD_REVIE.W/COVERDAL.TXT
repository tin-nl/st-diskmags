        by N.R.T.H. from the Admirables

You probably wonder why I,a member of a disk mag crew,am writing something
for our "competitor".Yes,the Admirables haven't stopped their disk 
magazine activities.To answer to your question,I first think that there's
no competition between us,Slimer is very nice,DBA needed help to release
their final disk mag on st,so I tried to write something for them.
Anyway,I already wrote some lyrics for our own mag,this article couldn't
be included.
O.k.,thanks to the title,you all understood what was going to be written
in the following lines.Before starting,I have to present you fastly this
album.
His name is "Coverdale-Page" and was done by ... David Coverdale and Jimmy
Page,two rock's legends.I hope you know which band they come from,if not 
just leave now and listen rap ! David Coverdale was the ex-vocalist of 
Deep Purple and after of White Snake,Jimmy Page was the guitarist of Led
Zeppelin.Do these bands remind you something ??? 

 _Don't leave me this way : line 28 to 92 . Real Playing time: 7'52"
 _Whisper a prayer for the dying : line 101 to 154 . 6'54" 
 _Take me for a little while : line 165 to 212 . 6'17"

Let's start with:

                  DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY
                  -----------------------

    I'm sick and tired
    And lonely,
    Sitting in my room,
    Staring at the shadows,
    Blowing smoke rings at the moon...
    Every night I try,
    But,every night I cry
    Trying to work out why,
    I just wanna know,got to know,
    Why you keep on pushin' me,baby...

    You love me when you want 
    And take me when you need,
    Whatever you say to me,baby,
    Makes my poor heart bleed...
    Now I don't wanna win,
    But,I don't wanna lose
    An' I don't wanna be alone no more...
    No more
    I just wanna give you love...
    I just gotta give you love...

    But,you keep on giving love,
    You give another man your love...
    Ooh,baby,don't you leave me this way...

    I never want to hurt you,
    Don't wanna tie you down,
    But,every time I take a look in the mirror
    I can see the heartache hangin' round...
    I'm going down,to the ground,
    Why you always wanna bring me down...
    Baby,baby,why do you always bring me
    Down... 

    'Cos,you keep on giving love,
    You give another man your love...
    Baby,baby,don't you leave me this way...

    Don't you leave me,baby,
    My heart is aching,
    My heart is breaking for you...

    And I can't take it anymore...

    I'm sick and tired
    And lonely,
    Nothing left to say,
    Just thinking 'bout you,baby,
    Takes all my night and day...
    All my nights...all my days...
    Baby,you take my breath away...

    'Cos,you keep on giving love,
    You give another man your love...
    Baby,baby,don't you leave me this way...

    I can't stop my love from falling down...
    I wanna love you in the morning,
    Wanna love you in the evening time...
    Don't you leave me,baby...
    Don't you ever leave me,baby...

                  WHISPER A PRAYER FOR THE DYING
                  ------------------------------  

    I hear the sound of distant thunder
    Echo all around,
    I see the tragedy of young ones
    Lying on the ground...
    I see the father's sons and daughters,
    I hear the mothers crying,
    Nothing left for me to do
    But,whisper a prayer for the dying...
    
    Oh,a prayer for the dying...
    
    The suffocation heat of jungles,
    And burning desert sands,
    Where everything reminds you
    You're a stranger in a strange land...
    The soothing words of politicians,
    Those bodyguards of lies,
    While guardian angels waste their time,
    And every mother cries...

    Oh,a prayer for the dying...

    Machine gun,battle cry,
    You pray to God when the bullets fly...
    The bombs fall like black rain
    An' all your dreams take you home again...

    Nothing but bad dreams...
   
    You can't read,you can't write,
    You're so scared,you can't sleep at night...
    You try to carry the heavy load
    Walking down Armageddon road...

    Oh Armageddon road...

    I hear the sound of distant thunder
    Echo all around,
    I see the tragedy of young ones
    Lying on the ground...
    I see the father's sons and daughters,
    I hear the mothers crying,
    Nothing left for me to do
    But,whisper a prayer for the dying...
    
    Oh,a prayer for the dying...
    
    You can't run,you can't hide
    You can't show what you feel inside..
    You're going crazy,going insane 
    You know you'll never be the same again...

                    TAKE ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE
                    --------------------------

    Now my days are growing cold
    All the memories unfold...
    Thinking about the friends we lost,
    Wondering how to count the cost 
    Now my days are growing cold...
    I can hardly wait any longer,
    Now the feeling's growing stronger...
    Thinking about the times we had,
    Good times always turn into bad...
    Now my days are growing cold...

    Why don't you take me 
    For a little while,
    Sing me songs,you know
    Will make me smile...
    Why don't you take me 
    For a little while...

    As I watch the rising sun
    I see a new day just begun...
    Thinking about the sacrifice,
    Wondering how to pay the price
    Now my world is growing cold...

    Why don't you take me 
    For a little while,
    Sing me songs,you know
    Will make me smile...
    Why don't you take me 
    For a little while...

    So now my days are growing cold
    All my memories been told...
    Thinking about the dreams we lost,
    Wondering how to count the cost
    Now my days are growing cold...

    Why don't you take me 
    For a little while,
    Sing me songs,you know
    Will make me smile...
    Why don't you take me 
    For a little while,
    Sing me songs,you know
    Will make me smile...
