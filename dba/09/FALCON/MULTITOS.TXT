                       INTRODUCTION

MultiTos is an operating system that allows you to run several programmes
at the same time (multitasking).
It looks like the ordinary TOS and behaves like the ordinary TOS but it
allows you to run several programmes in windows.
The desktop stays available when you run programmes, this gives you the
chance to load new ones while the other(s) are running.
Atari supplies MultiTos on disk because the program is still in the development 
stage and there are constantly new versions released.

It will take quite a while before MultiTos becomes available in ROM !

You need at least 4 megabytes to work properly with MultiTos, so if you
own a 1 meg. machine try to upgrade it as soon as possible.
It's still a big "???" why Atari released the 1 meg. Falcon, the system is
completly useless !
The good news is that Atari will put 2 meg. instead of 1 meg. in the future
machine's !

                        INSTALLING

After some days of waiting Atari finally decided to send me the software
that i didn't recieved with the Falcon.
I got Speedo Gdos, MultiTos and some updates from the programmes that i
already had.
Everything was compressed and you had to run an Install program to install
the programmes on the Hard-Disk.
The install programmes made me think that i was working on a PC or 
something like that, but nevertheless they make life easy !

After installing everything, i decided to run MultiTos.
So i pressed the reset button and then i realised how much resident
garbage i had running on the computer.
The Falcon was almost booting half a minute before i finally got to the
Desktop.

                        MULTITOS

It took MultiTos about 10 seconds to install itself in memory.
The first thing that i noticed was that everything worked slower then before
and that there was almost no difference between the "old" desktop and the
one from MultiTos.
The only things that are different are the options to turn off the cache
and the options to use TT resolutions.
In the Control Panel is now an option to disable/enable MultiTos.

I started to run the little program "Lines" and after that i loaded
"Lines" again.
Now i had two windows running "Lines" simultaneous on screen.
The programmes worked noticeable slower then when they are run alone and
this is only a simple line demo !

I treid some programmes, but most of them where terminated by MultiTos
because they violated the rules.
Only applications that are programmed exactly by the rules will work under
MultiTos and other programmes will be terminated.
There where also some serious crashes that made me boot the system all
over again.

                        CONCLUSION

It will take some time before there are enough applications that are
programmed exactly by the rules that allows them to run under MultiTos.
MultiTos still contains some bugs, for instance sometimes the mouse
pointer will turn into a busy bee and won't change back to a pointer.
This bug is one of the many bugs i found in the program.
There is still much work to be done before the program is good enough
to work properly with most of the other applications.

It will get really useful if it becomes available in ROM otherwise it takes
to much of your memory and speed.
When the program is working on a 4 Meg. machine it leaves only 1 and a
half Meg. free to work with !

Another disadvantage is the speed of the 68030, it is in my opinion just
a bit to slow to do some serious multitasking !
I rather had a faster processor instead of the old soundchips of both
the ST and STE !
MultiTos in this stage is to slow for my comfort and i stick with my "old"
TOS till it comes in ROM.

If Atari gets MultiTos to work properly in ROM then they will have a
powerfull operating system with a lot of possibility's !

One last last remark before i quit,

MultiTos is also available for the Atari ST    ( with at least 2 meg. )
                                   Atari STE   ( with at least 2 meg. )
                                   Atari TT030 
                                   Atari Stacy
