         WORKING WITH THE FALCON, THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS

              4 Meg. memory + internal 65 MB HD.

                        INTRODUCTION

For people who haven't bought a Falcon yet, here's a short impression
of the machine by me(Slimer),

The Atari Falcon comes with 2 disk's, 2 booklets( one computer 
manual and one for the calendar program ) and the usual wires 'n stuff.
After i hooked up the computer with the monitor and the power socket
it was time to hit the switch.

The Atari logo appears on the screen and a memory check begins, this
is ofcourse very irritating, so i smashed the space-bar and the computer
continues with booting.
After a few seconds i get welcomed by the desktop, wow, it looks kind of
fancy in comparison with my old desktop on the ST.
The desktop in color with nice drawn icon's and things......

Because i was used working with an old TOS 1.0 version, i decided to
check out the manual for some information about extra features and stuff.
I was suprised by the manual, it was actually quite clear and well written
and that's very weird for Atari standard's !
After a couple of minutes of reading i throwed the manual back on the 
table and started to look around on the internal Hard-Disk. 

                        PLAYING AROUND

Whoopy, there are several programmes on the Harddisk, i decided to load
the Breakout game first.
SHOCK(!!) What's this then for worthless piece of crap, the game turned
out to be a small bad working breakout clone with even worse sound !
The sound is playing at the highest possible output level and can't be
adjusted with the Control Panel.

Landmine is even worse then the breakout game but at least the sound
output is adjustable !
These two games give you the idea that you just bought a souped up ZX 81.

The calendar program is of no use to me, so i looked at it once and will
probably never look at it again.

It was another shock to find out that both MultiTos and Speedo GDos
wheren't on the Harddisk.
There are infact a couple of computer shops who give you a version with
the computer when you buy it.
It was just a couple of days later that i found out that you must fill
out a blue piece of paper that came with the computer and return it to 
Atari to recieve the programmes !
Most people (including me) don't look at these papers and throw them in
the thras-can, nobody didn't mentioned it to me that you had to fill
out the form.

Anyway, very amusing was the config program to choose the language with, i
couldn't find the Dutch language anywhere !
I could remember that Atari would also make a Dutch version.....


                        DESKTOP RUMBLINGS

After looking at all the garbage on my Hard-Disk it was time to explore
the machine a bit more.
The only things that i already examed where the Control Panel and the
Video modes.
Interlace wasn't quite what i had expected from it, the flickering is
even worse then i had imagined it would be. 
I found that the Desktop was faster then my old TOS 1.0 but in comparison
with TOS 2.06 it hadn't gained much speed.
Both versions look pretty much the same if you leave the colors out.
So, for the people who switch from TOS 2.06 to TOS 4.02 it won't be
any problem working with it.
For people who switch from older version it will be a big improvement !  

The nicest thing about this Desktop is that you can choose from different
colored icons, they animate a bit when you highlight them.


                   MORE COMPATIBLE THEN THE TT ?

No way man, i hadn't any decent software for the Falcon in the first
couple of days, so i started to test my old ST software.
There was almost nothing that worked and even if it did work, the
programmes became buggy. 
A program like Degas Elite will work but won't show any of the fill
patterns anymore.
Some programmes seem to work fine, till you try a certain funktion...... 


With the Falcon comes also a patch,
this patch will make some programmes
that don't play sound, play again !           ~chipfire.bl2~






      THE REAL WORK






Bonus visited me and brought some Falcon software along with him, i
finally could watch some decent demo's and stuff.
He also brought the Terminal Fuck Up demo along and although i had seen
it before, i was still amazed by it.
It showed what the Falcon is capable of, instead of running stupid 
Breakout games.
There where also some other programmes that where quite nice, like a
Hard-Disk recording program and some fractal stuff.
One of the programmes called Frac !(uses the DSP) can also be installed
as a CPX file in the Control Panel.

I did also some experiments with the Hard-Disk recording program by 
sampling several pieces of music on different sample rates.
The dynamic output on 50 Khz is higher then a CD player and the recordings
came very very near my CD player.
There is one remark about all this, the wire between both the computer
and the CD player is to long and not of super quality !

Many people who buy a Falcon think to get instant CD sound out of it, 
don't forget it takes a lot of Hard-Disk space to record a 50 Khz 
sample !!
The 50 Khz rate is only usefull when you send the signal direct to a
recording device, the high sample rate is practical useless for the
ordinary computer user.

The high rate however could be very usefull to make modules with and
you can use them without having to use that much memory.

                        CONCLUSION

This machine has great capability's and will certainly be good for some
exciting years to come.
Although the machine is a bit slow for modern times it will keep up for
a couple of years, thanks to the DSP chip.
I have seen some rather amazing examples of power by the DSP chip and
i think if this chip is used to limits it will become very usefull
( and not only for sound purposes ).

This impression is only after a week of playing with the Falcon, so my
opinion could change.

                       SOME TIPS

Buy a stereo cable with the machine, this way you can hook it up with
the amplifier to get some decent sound out of it.
You can use the same cable to record sound with by plugging it into the 
CD player and the microphone jack.

Buy a SVGA with the machine to see the higher resolution without using
the interlace mode.

Don't forget to send the blue form to Atari to obtain MultiTos and Speedo
Gdos.
