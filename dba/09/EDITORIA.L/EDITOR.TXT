HELLO and WELCOME to the last official ST issue of the D.B.A. magazine.
We had a rather hard time collecting articles because our regular writers
didn't react this time.
I think it has something to do with that new virus called "Falcon" that
makes them forget everything around them.
Anyway we managed to release the magazine and we hope that the new Falcon
users get off there lazy asses and help us out with articles and stuff !!

I'm also happy to announce that I (Slimer) and Bonus both bought a Falcon
sometime ago.
We where waiting for the new cased ones but Atari didn't release any till
now and even deny that there ever will be a new cased Falcon 030.
So we decided to buy a Falcon now and build it in a case later !
Okay that's it on the Falcon part, you can read more about this machine
in this issue.

What do we have this time,

** Another real-time article from the party held by Sentry called
   "Innovation" !
** Falcon, the hardware review and Falcon software reviews !
** We have everything there is to know about ATARI WORKS including
   several hi-res screen shots !
** News about the Falcon and Atari in general !
** There is again a lot of hardware information about the ST/STE and
   Falcon in this magazine( look in the "Hardware corner" ).
** The "Hi-Fi Box" contains a audiobiography by Slimer.
** There is a lot on Hard-Rock and a Van Halen CD review.
** We've got everything there is to know about the Jaguar !!
** A Star-Wars film script ( orginal ) from Return of the Jedi, supplied
   by Lowlife ( Thanks man ).
** In the "Craptalk Corner" you will find some Monthy Python stuff also
   supplied by Lowlife !
** Man check out the Ascii Art of Jovis in the "Asciiart Corner", don't
   wet your pants !
** There are even articles about God and Faith in this issue !
** The "Console corner" contains some good game reviews.

We'll hope that you have a good time reading these articles, we did our
best to make the last issue as good as we could.
