pant.

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Great fun. It's good to see what can be done. I hate long scrolltexts
and scrolltexts wich are encoded so I can't read them with the 
Ultimate Ripper.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
I know only a few people personally so I can't tell you that. (Hi DULL
do you still want my quest screens or is there somebody who offers
more money for my screens ??? )

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
More Ste stuff. More Jokes/Animations like Bitner (Burrrp) song in 
Life's a bitch and chainsaw in Oooh Crickey. And Hotline 
(anti mad max) Sounddemo II

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
If you don't ruin the original programs it's good and it saves disk space.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
They make great hardware but they must push the hardware more. 
And they must make more games for the lynx (where is Lemmings for
the lynx ??)

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
A lot af games are not playable because they want to much. 
They want to make the atari version look like the amiga version 
which destroys the speed.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
Keep it low it destroys the market. Buy good and playable software 
like most games from Eclipse and Thalion.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Yes, but most budget software is old and/or crap like EDOS system 
in Holland.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ACN Atari ST Nieuws, ST from Stichting ST, ST Format and Com Lynx-er

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
ST Format is too negative to demos.

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
Spent more space about demos and the demo scene.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
There are sometimes good and usefull programs on it but mostly it is crap.

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
I like it but it is more difficult to rip it out of the closet and
find a specific article. (You can't wipe your ase with a disk 
(just joking) a 5 1/4 would be easier. (just more joking))

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
To much stories before articles by ST-News. Mostly there are 
intresting things in it.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
I don't know

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
Playboy on CD-I. CD-I in general, a falcon with CD Rom is much better. 

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
Another word for MARIO and INTEL. People who use code, graphics 
and sound from others and don't credit them.

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
They must know for themselfs if they want to be hated by everone.

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Do something usefull for mankind.( Write to/for DBA; buy only ATARI 
computers;  Change Nintendo/Sega/Commodore/Intel troep  users 
into ATARI users)     

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I bought a ATARI 800 XL about 8 years ago (best 8 bit machine) and 
started in BASIC and some time later 6502 machine language ( only with 
a monitor and no assembler) and I cracked a couple of disk games and I 
converted ZYBEX from tape to disk and wrote a intro and trainer for it. 
About 4 years ago I bought a ATARI ST and I am trying to code 
68000 Assembly for 2/3 year now.
