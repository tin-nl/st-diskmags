Clothes (like jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap etc)...                  (2 LINES)
Depends in what situation I am, for business certainly NOT jeans.

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Cool, cause there are many new effects in demo's which can be used in games   
so it makes the games much better looking. 

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
Demo crews on Amiga are real ego trippers. The ST scene has been split up in 2
parts, the old-scene with the Lost Boys, Carebears etc and the new scene 
with the Hemoroids, Sentry, Aura etc.
 
What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
No games, that's a waiste of time. First try out to make a decent demo with a 
really stunnishing design, and if you're good enough try to make all stuff 
you will make commercial. That's much better, And you'll learn a lot !

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
Nope, cause many programs like small dentro's will spread anyway, if they are 
good enough. The rest which the most people won't isn't that good...........

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
Atari ? Aaaargh. The backup is really terrible, for example take the
Scandinavian countries, what does Atari actually do over there ? Not much !  

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
Yeah, they are alright, not as good as on the SNES, but ok !

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
It's good that there's piracy, cause many people won't otherwise buy a game, 
before seeing it. And I think if a game is really worthwhile buying it, 
people will buy it anyway. Games are still to expensive for younger
people I think.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Could be.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
EGM, that's all at the moment I'm afraid.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
Too much rubbish !

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
I wouldn't bring out a magazine at all !!!

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Nope, the maggy's are already expensive enough, although sometimes there are 
good programs on it, but that's perhaps 1 time in 2 years.

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Great, it's a cheap way to spread recent information, you have no costs 
whatsoever advertising in papers etc. And it will spread very fast usually.

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Some articles, like what's going on in the Scene, and the slagging parts.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
Nothing, just bring the next maggy out !

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
A lot, too much to mention.

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A 'lamer' is a person who thinks he made it all in the demo scene, like one   
person in Holland, I think his name is Michael H. He's really the biggest 
lamer all times ! Spreading nonsence about coding demo's etc.
HE NEEDS TO BE SHOT !!

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
Well there are all kinda lamers. You can't do anything about them, just leave 
them alone, and ignore them. Perhaps they'll see what they really are.

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Don't boast ! Make something usefull for other people, so you don't have to 
act as a lamer.

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
Pretty lame I think, like almost all people started.
