We have seen them before, programs the emulate hi-resolution on a normal
RGB monitor. But this one is somewhat different. It has some new features
and it works from the bootsector.

It's a very small prg, it has to or else it couldn't work from the 
bootsector, and it has a view options:

1. Save Emulator             - Seems clear save it to a bootsektor

2. Save Blitter Emulator     - Extended version of the emulator, save
                               it to the bootsector.

3. Clear Bootsector          - Clears the bootsector (old virus or old
                               emulator version)

4. Emulationspeed            - Can be set from 2 till 8 Vbls. Default 
                               is 3 Vbls. A slower screenupdating 
                               gives you a faster calculation, it 
                               depends on what you prefer...

5. Screenupdating            - An option to switch on/off the screen-
                               updating while accesing the diskdrive.
                               
6. Quit                      - Quess what that does ????

          
A very nice small util, which works very good. I already tried it with 
Signum 2 and Degas Elite but it all works very good. This way you 
could also see the pictures that are in the folder ATARIWORKS. They 
are all in .PC3 format and if you don't have a SM-124 or 125 you 
couldn't look at them. So here is the solution...

I tried it on the Falcon but it doesn't work on it, so i presume it's
ST/STE only !

It's all coded by Awe of Q2 and I think he did a great job on this one.
Thanks go to Q2 for sending it to us. Hope to see more of these small 
good things in the future also on the Falcon.
