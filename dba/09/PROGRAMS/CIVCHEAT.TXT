Tested On:
==========
The program is known to work with the following computers : 520ST,
1040ST, 520STE, 1040STE, and MEGASTe.
       
This program was written for the owners of the game Civilization by
Microprose and is copyrighted by Microprose.

Since CIVCHEAT does not use any undocumened variables. It should work
with any TOS Version.

The program was tested on a 1040STe with TOS 2.06 and a Mega-STe with
TOS 2.05 using standard Color/Mono monitors.  It currently runs in
LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH resolutions under TOS 1.00 - 2.06.  It should run
under other TOS's, but I have no way to test them.


Other Stuff:
============
This program was written on a 1040STe using Dev-Pac ST Version 2.00.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
========
This program will increase the amount of money you have to $30,000.  I
found that you can do it as many times as you want without any
penalties.

This program will take a existing saved game file and change it.  You
will have to watch the game when you save a file to get the file name:
CIVIL#.SVE where # is the number of the game on disk.

NOTE:  The money amount is saved in two places in the saved game file,
       one is for the date B.C. and the other one is for A.D.  This file
       modifies both locations.
