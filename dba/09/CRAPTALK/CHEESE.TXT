(a customer walks in the door.)
 
Customer: Good Morning.
Owner:    Good morning, Sir.  Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium!
Customer: Ah, thank you, my good man.
Owner:    What can I do for you, Sir?
C: Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now,
   skimming through "Rogue Herrys" by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over
   all peckish.
O: Peckish, sir?
C: Esuriant.
O: Eh?
C: 'Ee, Ah wor 'ungry-loike!
O: Ah, hungry!
C: In a nutshell.  And I thought to myself, "a little fermented curd will do
   the trick," so, I curtailed my Walpoling activites, sallied forth, and
   infiltrated your place of purveyance to negotiate the vending of some cheesy
   comestibles!
O: Come again?
C: I want to buy some cheese.
O: Oh, I thought you were complaining about the bazouki player!
C: Oh, heaven forbid: I am one who delights in all manifestations of the
   Terpsichorean muse!
O: Sorry?
C: 'Ooo, Ah lahk a nice tuune, 'yer forced too!
O: So he can go on playing, can he?
C: Most certainly!  Now then, some cheese please, my good man.
O: (lustily) Certainly, sir.  What would you like?
C: Well, eh, how about a little red Leicester.
O: I'm, a-fraid we're fresh out of red Leicester, sir.
C: Oh, never mind, how are you on Tilsit?
O: I'm afraid we never have that at the end of the week, sir, we get it
   fresh on Monday.
C: Tish tish.  No matter.  Well, stout yeoman, four ounces of Caerphilly, if
   you please.
O: Ah!  It's beeeen on order, sir, for two weeks.  Was expecting it this
   morning.
C: 'T's Not my lucky day, is it?   Aah, Bel Paese?

C: Oh, I like it runny.
O: Well,.. It's very runny, actually, sir.
C: No matter.  Fetch hither the fromage de la Belle France!  Mmmwah!
O: I...think it's a bit runnier than you'll like it, sir.
C: I don't care how fucking runny it is.  Hand it over with all speed.

C: No no... don't tell me.   I'm keen to guess.
O: Fair enough.
C: Uuuuuh, Wensleydale.
O: Yes?
C: Ah, well, I'll have some of that!

C: Not much ca--It's the single most popular cheese in the world!
O: Not 'round here, sir.
C: <slight pause> and what IS the most popular cheese 'round hyah?
O: 'Illchester, sir.
C: IS it.

C: I see.  Uuh...'Illchester, eh?

   'Have you got any?' he asked, expecting the answer 'no'.
O: I'll have a look, sir...
   nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnno.
C: It's not much of a cheese shop, is it?

C: Have you --SHUT THAT BLOODY BAZOUKI OFF!
O: Told you sir....
C: (slowly) Have you got any Limburger?
O: No.
C: Figures.
   Predictable, really I suppose.  It was an act of purest optimism to have
   posed the question in the first place.  Tell me:
O: Yessir?
C: (deliberately) Have you in fact got any cheese here at all.
O: Yes,sir.
C: Really?
(pause)
O: No.  Not really, sir.
C: You haven't.
O: Nosir.  Not a scrap.  I was deliberately wasting your time,sir.
C: Well I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to shoot you.
O: Right-0, sir.
 
The customer takes out a gun and shoots the owner.
 
C: What a *senseless* waste of human life.
