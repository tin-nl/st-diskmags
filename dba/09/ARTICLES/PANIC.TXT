PANIC O/T MARKET


PANIC ON THE COMPUTER MARKET,

I was reading on the Dutch (20-07-93) Teletext that there has been an 
explosion in a Japanese resin factory.
The Factory called "Sumitomo Chemical" makes resin for chip shells 
( especially memory chips ).
This factory supplies 60 % of the world production !!

                        ~chipfire.bl2~










Prices are risen by 100 % over the last couple of days when i wrote
this.....
It seems that the prices of computers will go up with hundreds of
dollars !
I'm not shure if this has any effect on the prices of the Falcon but
i think that it the Falcon will become more expensive !

The situation will remain till the end of this year, the rest of the
international manufacturers will try to produce as much as possible !
