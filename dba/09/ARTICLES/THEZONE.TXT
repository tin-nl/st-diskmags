You are walking in a room filled with smoke, and you can hardly
see anything, but you must have your eyes pealed, because the
enemy is nearby. 

Suddenly a lot of shouting fills the room. "A hell, the ENEMY".
Laser-rays seem to fill the room and you just try to not get hit,
and when you duck away you nearly can hit another enemy.

When after a few minutes everything is cleared you think by 
yourself where am I??? 

Is this the new beginning of a new science fiction series? No it isn't
it reality. (Hard to believe isn't it.) I will now refer to the last
question: You are at "The Zone" in Amsterdam. 

"The Zone" is an old cellar which was redocrated for a new scenario
for a lasergame. This lasergame is new variant on the bit more 
environmental poluting game called Paint ball.

The idea is simple get two groups of people who don't hate each other,
give them some laser-guns, and send them of in a 420 square metres
big maze. When one of the lasers hits a laser-tag of the enemy
a main-computer registers it, and gives the shooting boy or girl
50 points, and the other "freezes" for a few seconds (He or she
can't use his lasergun at this time, He or she can avoid other 
lasers)

Overseas such games are more well-known as over here, but according
to the manager of this lasergameshootemup-companies there will be
a real invasion of such companies over here in the Netherlands. 

The software that keeps the computer going is imported out of England
by a British firm called Leisure Tech. "The Zone" is only the
second place to play the game on the European continent. The first
one you can find in Antwerpen (Belgie)

The price you have to pay is not very much, it is only Fl 10,--
( 10 guilders ) So maybe it is a nice idea for a new computer
party.
