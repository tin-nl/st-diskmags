VERY LATE !


Yes indeed we are very late this time, but why...

1)  We had to rebuild a part of the magazine so it would work also
    on a Falcon. It was a nasty small job but I think we managed
    to do so.

2)  The intro, as usual is always the thing that comes late no
    matter what we do. But we rather wait a bit longer that get
    a bad thing. So this intro was no exception on the rule.

3)  There are many people that don't know what to do. Buy a 
    Falcon or still hang around on the good old ST/e and wait
    what the future will bring. 

4)  Also lots of people didn't know for sure if our magazine would
    support the ST, so they didn't write anymore or very late after
    we told them it would. So thats the reason why there are less
    articles this time. Esp. the STOS corner,it's empty.

5)  Some of the programs were late because of some last minut
    bug fixing and the post screw up. This program was made by
    Wingleader, The Synergy Mega Depacker. First there were still
    small bugs so the program would work on TOS 1.0 (yes it still
    is being used) and after that the post delivered the package
    but the contents was stolen/lost out of it. So another 5
    days were lost before the good version was at the HQ.

6)  I don't know anymore, I just can't remember all of them.

Our next issue should be out around christmas time, and that will
be third (!) christmas issue of the magazine. Hopefully the new
shell will be ready for the Falcon by then. We won't promise anything 
anymore about that. If you want to make an intro for that issue please 
contact us...

Until next issue, Bonus and Slimer
