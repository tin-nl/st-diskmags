In the past several issues of AEO, Andreas and Lyre discussed the Word
Processor and Spreadsheet portions of Atari Works. This installment
will focus on the Database part of the program.

The database module of Atari Works allows one to access a group of
non-homogenous data elements in many different ways. One method can be
as an individual record and another as a group of records.

//// Import/Export

When one first runs Atari Works, and selects "database", one is given
the option creating a new database or importing an existing database.
The options for importing a pre-existing dBASE III data file (also
known as a dbf file) is straight forward. Select "Import file" (or
SHIFT-CONTROL-O) under the FILE menu and then choose the DBF file
option. A file selector appears and the file is imported quickly.
The advantage of the DBF file is that most database programs can
import and export that file type (i.e., SuperBase, dbMAN, etc).

The other option is a delimited ASCII file and the delimiter can be
changed by the user (tab, space, comma, and pipe symbols are common
ones). This allows for a much greater variety of import/export
capability since ascii data files are generated and used by many
programs.

//// Grab and Drag

The other method is to create a database file from scratch. This is
what can be thought of the grab and drag phase. Selecting NEW
(CONTROL-N) option under the FILE menu one begins the process of
creating a database.

A dialog box appears and one inputs the name of the desired field.
This process continues until the user selects the done option. Now
the grab operation begins. The entire screen is a blank form and one
places the fields anywhere he/she wishes on the screen. All of the
fields are currently in a linear layout from top to the bottom of the
screen.

Moving the mouse cursor over the field name and pressing the left
mouse button allows one to drag the field to any position. After the
position is found one can stretch the data portion of the field
accordingly. By grabbing (selecting a region with the mouse and
holding down the left mouse button) the right end of the field one can
change the size of the field from 1 to 255 characters in length.

Also with each field comes a series of attributes of which some are
listed below.

TYPE:        DISPLAY:     DATE:     STYLE:      ALIGN:
====================================================================
text         general      short     bold        left
numeric      fixed        medium    underline   center
date         currency     long      italic      right
time         percent      show day  comma
computed
       
The following shows examples of some of the different formats:

short  date    2/13/1993
medium date    Feb 13, 1993
long   date    February 13, 1993
long date +
  show day     Sunday, February 13, 1993

In Currency formats: (negative values are enclosed in () ).

   $56.00
 ($403.42)

Adding the comma option yields results like:

$45,000.23

One can then try out the many other options to yield the results
he/she is looking for. It is very simple to change the field type at
anytime after creation of the database as well.

In using the computed fields one types in a formula using the fields
and or functions needed to perform a specific calculation. The
formula remains hidden until any part of the column is selected then
the formula appears on the data entry line at the top of the screen.

The dynamic nature of the database allows you to add fields specially
for calculations during the course of your work. Then can be removed
at any time so one does not have to create a new database everytime
one needs to perform some specific calculation.

If a mistake is made when spelling a field name one can just double
click on field name and change it. One of the best features of
database is that everything is dynamic. The field names can be
changed, the field sizes, fonts and more fields can be added at any
time. So as your needs change your database can change with you.

//// Two Modes of Viewing Data

There are two basic modes of operation. One being the form view and
the other being the list view. Basically one can think of the form
mode as examining a single record while the list mode can show several
records at once.

By double clicking (while in form mode) on any blank space that is
not currently occupied by a field the mode changes instantly to list
mode. This list mode looks the same as the spreadsheet but the way
data is acted upon is very different. Double clicking to the left of
all the records in list mode will take you back to the form mode.

In the list mode you can move the fields (columns) into any order you
wish at any time. Just click on the column name (field name) and hold
down the mouse. Then drag it to the new position. The fields can
also be sized as well by grabbing the vertical line that separates any
two fields. This will size the field size to the left of that line.
It very useful to have the complete freedom to dynamically change
anything about the database at will.

//// Multiple Files

In moving data around the most popular functions are:

1) CUT     ( CONTROL-X )
2) COPY    ( CONTROL-C )
3) PASTE   ( CONTROL-V )
4) DELETE  (    DEL    )

The functions are also found under the EDIT menu. One of the most
useful features of Atari Works is the ability to have multiple files
open at any one time. These can be any combination of word processing,
spreadsheets, graphs or database files.

For database users this is very useful way to merge selected data from
one database file to another. Every file that is open is treated as a
completely separate entity. One can select certain records in one
database file and then paste them into another. The makes updating
databases a very simple operation.

//// Selecting the right information

To display only the information a person needs is very easy with Atari
Works. For example one needs to find all records that have the word
"ATARI" in them. Choosing the SELECT menu and the match records
(CONTROL-M) a dialog box appears. One types in the word Atari and
presses return. Within a few seconds all records that have the word
Atari in any field will be selected. This is a very simple method but
one can easily get more complicated by using the select records
function.

Other features include the ability to search all fields for a matching
value. One can search text fields for sub-strings for example. One can
include or exclude non text fields if the user so desires. It works
equally well on numeric and non-numeric fields and is a very useful
when one needs to jump to a specific field within any record. This is
very helpful when one needs to edit fields with a specific record as
well.

By choosing the SELECT menu and the option select records (CONTROL-R)
you can perform a more complicated query. This gives the user more
control over the entire process of selecting right information. The
three steps necessary for making a query are as follows:

a) choose field name
b) choose relational operator (operation to perform)
c) value to compare against

For example how does one find out how many people in New York and pay
90% in taxes? Basically this requires two parts and both parts must
be true.

 1).  live in New York
 2).  pay 90% in taxes

The relational operators that act upon a field are as follows:

is less than
is less than or equal to
is equal to
is not equal to
is greater than or equal to
is greater than

In the database there are fields "city" and "tax" which will be used.
The formula Atari Works creates is as follows:

city is equal to New York AND tax is equal to 90%

The steps one has to follow involve using the rules. The first step
involves selecting the field to act upon. City is chosen first and
the operation "is equal to" and the the value is New York. The second
step selects the Tax field, operation "is equal to" and the value 90
percent.

When selecting a field name one does not have to type in the name but
select it from a scrollable list. The same is true for the operators.
The only input required is at the rule or value input which is the
last part needed for any rule.

This is a very easy to install the rules and select how the rules
work with one another using AND or OR. In this case it would work as
follows:

1.  Choose the field CITY
2.  Choose operator "is equal to"
3.  Input NEW YORK for the value or rule
4.  Install Rule
5.  Choose the field TAX
6.  Choose operator "is equal to"
7.  Input 90 for value or rule
8.  Install rule
9.  Choose the AND option 

One can perform a much more complicated query than is listed here but
it is just to give one the idea how this would work.

//// How does one restart?

There is an option under the SELECT menu called show all (CONTROL-E)
which displays all the records in the database. After one has
selected specific records one can view/select all of them by using the
command show all.

//// Fonts and the Display

The Fonts play a very useful role in way one accesses the information
in the database. If one want to see more records on the screen at one
time during the list mode one can reduce the size of the font to view
even more records. So fonts can play a very important role in
addition to making the output look spectacular.

//// Report Generation

Report generation follows the same principles involved with selecting
records. The main difference is the output is sent to the printer.
There are other features as well such as the ability to sum a field,
sub-total a field and start a new page after a sub-total. Using all
of the options discussed earlier one should be able to generate
reports very quickly.

//// Conclusion

The database allows one to add and subtract fields and records at
will. The dynamic nature of the Atari Works database module is what
makes it so useful. In addition, the user can sit and down and start
almost immediately without having to read the manual too much, except
for reference purposes. The other features include the ability to mail
merge with the word processor, generate reports, and change fonts and
sizes with very little work involved. In working with Works it's easy
to forget that there are other modules in the same package other than
the one you are currently using. It seems strange sometimes that one
just has to open a different file type (spreadsheet or word processor)
to access that part of the program. All in all, Atari Works is one of
the most exciting integrated software packages I have seen in a long
time.
