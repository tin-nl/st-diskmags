RETURN OF JEDI P5

                         LANDO
               Come on, let's get off this miserable dust 
               ball.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE                                      44A

     The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing
     appears and peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON
     appears as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the
     CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT                                           45

     Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside
     the canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the
     MILLENNIUM FALCON.

                              LUKE
               I'll meet you back at the fleet.

                              LEIA (over comlink)
               Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by
               now.

                              LUKE
               I will.

                              HAN (over comlink)
               Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after
               me. Now I owe you one.

     A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front
     of Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he
     pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

                              LUKE
     That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a
     promise to keep... to an old friend.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR                               46

     A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet
     rest in space above the half-completed Death Star and its green
     neighbor, Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial
     shuttle toward the Death Star.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY                       47

     Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very
     nervous Death Star commander.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR                                   48

     Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth
     docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform,
     where the shuttle is coming to rest.

     The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out
     and create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid
     attention with a momentous SNAP.

     Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He
     is a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes
     its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a
     hooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is
     black. The Emperor's face is shrouded and difficult to see,
     except for his piercing yellow eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and
     Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme Ruler of the galaxy beckons
     to the Dark Lord.

                              EMPEROR (to Vader)
               Rise, my friend.

     Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes
     his way along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other
     commanders stay kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader,
     followed by several Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do
     they join in the procession.

                              VADER
               The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

                              EMPEROR
               You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I
               sense you wish to continue your search for
               young Skywalker.

                              VADER
               Yes, my Master.

                              EMPEROR
               Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you
               out. And when he does, you must bring him
               before me. He has grown strong. Only together
               can we turn him to the dark side of the
               Force.

                              VADER
               As you wish.

                              EMPEROR
               Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

     He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial
     troops.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH                                     49

     Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp
     environs of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it.
     He beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's
     cottage. Warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to
     fight the gloom.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE                                               50

     The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen
     floor of the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small
     green hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of
     YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. His manner is frail, and his voice, though
     cheerful, seems weaker.

                              YODA
               Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to
               young eyes?

     Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his
     look has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.

                              LUKE
               No... of course not.

                              YODA (tickled, chuckles)
               I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and
               weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine
               hundred years old you reach, look as good you
               will not. Hmm?

     Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

                              YODA
               Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned
               it, I have.

     Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

                              LUKE
               Master Yoda, you can't die.

                              YODA
               Strong am I with the Force... but not that
               strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night
               must fall. That is the way of things ... the
               way of the Force.

                              LUKE
               But I need your help. I've come back to
               complete the training.

                              YODA
               No more training do you require. Already know
               you that which you need.

     Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

                              LUKE
               Then I am a Jedi?

                              YODA (shakes his head)
               Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You
               must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi
               will you be. And confront him you will.

     Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his
     courage. Finally he is able to ask.

                              LUKE
               Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?

     Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad
     smile creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from
     Luke.

                              YODA
               Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

     Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

                              LUKE
               Yoda, I must know.

                              YODA
               Your father he is.

     Luke reacts as if cut.

                              YODA
               Told you, did he?

                              LUKE
               Yes.

     A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.

                              YODA
               Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

                              LUKE
               Unfortunate that I know the truth?

     Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

                              YODA (gathering all his strength)
               No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face
               him... that incomplete was your training. Not
               ready for the burden were you.

                              LUKE
               Well, I'm sorry.

                              YODA
               Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the
               Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression.
               The dark side are they.  Once you start down
               the dark path, forever will it dominate your
               destiny.

     He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.

                              YODA
               Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate
               the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your
               father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
               (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be.
               Luke, the Force runs strong in your family.
               Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with
               great effort) There is...
               another...Sky...Sky...walker.

     He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green
     creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he
     disappears in front of his eyes.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING                                     51

     Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a
     greeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels
     down, begins to help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes
     his head dejectedly.

                              LUKE
               I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

                              BEN (OS)
               Yoda will always be with you.

     Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.

                              LUKE
               Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?

     The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.

                              LUKE
               You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my
               father.

                              BEN
               You father was seduced by the dark side of
               the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
               and became Darth Vader. When that happened,
               the good man who was your father was
               destroyed. So what I have told you was
               true... from a certain point of view.

                              LUKE (turning away, derisive)
               A certain point of view!

                              BEN
               Luke, you're going to find that many of the
               truths we cling to depend greatly on our own
               point of view.

     Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.

                              BEN
               I don't blame you for being angry. If I was
               wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't
               have been for the first time. You see, what
               happened to your father was my fault.

     Ben pauses sadly.

                              BEN
               Anakin was a good friend.

     Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on
     a stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting
     presence.

                              BEN
               When I first knew him, your father was
               already a great pilot. But I was amazed how
               strongly the Force was with him.  I took it
               upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I
               thought that I could instruct him just as
               well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has
               had terrible consequences for the galaxy.

     Luke is entranced.

                              LUKE
               There's still good in him.

                              BEN
               I also thought he could be turned back to the
               good side. It couldn't be done. He is more
               machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

                              LUKE
               I can't do it, Ben.

                              BEN
               You cannot escape your destiny.

                              LUKE
               I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

                              BEN
               Vader humbled you when first you met him,
               Luke...but that experience was part of your
               training. It taught you, among other things,
               the value of patience.  Had you not been so
               impatient to defeat Vader then, you could
               have finished your training here with Yoda.
               You would have been prepared.

                              LUKE
               But I had to help my friends.

                              BEN (grinning at Luke's indignation)
               And did you help them? It was they who had to
               save you. You achieved little by rushing back
               prematurely, I fear.

                              LUKE (with sadness)
               I found out Darth Vader was my father.

                              BEN
               To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and
               then go beyond the dark side - the side your
               father couldn't get past. Impatience is
               the easiest door - for you, like your father.
               Only, your father was seduced by what he
               found on the other side of the door, and you
               have held firm. You're no longer so reckless
               now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And
               now, you must face Darth Vader again!

                              LUKE
               I can't kill my own father.

                              BEN
               Then the Emperor has already won. You were
               our only hope.

                              LUKE
               Yoda spoke of another.

                              BEN
               The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

                              LUKE
               But I have no sister.

                              BEN
               Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor,
               you were hidden from your father when you
               were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if
               Anakin were to have any offspring, they would
               be a threat to him. That is the reason why
               your sister remains safely anonymous.

                              LUKE
               Leia! Leia's my sister.

                              BEN
               Your insight serves you well. Bury your
               feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit.
               But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

     Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.
