RETURN OF JEDI P13

                              LUKE (groans)
               Father, please. Help me.

     Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the
     Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor.

                              EMPEROR
               Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

     Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of
     bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity,
     the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in
     pain.

     Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the
     robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely
     weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-
     shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white
     lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load
     as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black
     cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to
     the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With
     one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls
     the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.

     The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it
     falls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the
     shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.
     Vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and
     collapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's
     side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety.
     Both the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move.

126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR               126

     Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death
     Star to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the super-
     structure of the giant battle station, followed by many TIE
     fighters.

                              WEDGE
               I'm going in.

                              LANDO
               Here goes nothing.

     Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft,
     followed by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters
     who continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the
     pilot's faces as they race through the dark shaft.

                              LANDO
               Now lock onto the strongest power source. It
               should be the power generator.

                              WEDGE
               Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of
               space real fast.

     The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still
     pursued by the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from
     behind and explodes.

                              LANDO
               Split up and head back to the surface. See if
               you can get a few of those TIE fighters to
               follow you.

                              PILOT
               Copy, Gold Leader.

     The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while
     Lando and Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and
     the Falcon scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters
     continue to blast away at them.

                              LANDO
               That was too close.

     Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet
     rages on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star
     Destroyer.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               127

                              ACKBAR
               We've got to give those fighters more time.
               Concentrate all fire on that Super Star
               Destroyer.

     X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.

128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE                           128

     Admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to
     the battle. They look concerned.

                              CONTROLLER
               Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

                              PIETT
               Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want
               anything to get through.

     The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel
     fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.

                              PIETT
               Intensify forward firepower!

                              COMMANDER
               It's too late!

     The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer,
     causing a huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control,
     crashes into the Death Star, and explodes.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               129

     There is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all
     sides. They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY                             130

     Chaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions
     as the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over,
     unloading a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions,
     confused and desperate to escape.

     In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous
     deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial
     shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions
     grow louder as Vader draws him closer.

                              VADER (a whisper)
               Luke, help me take this mask off.

                              LURE
               But you'll die.

                              VADER
               Nothing can stop that now. Just for once...
               let me look on you with my own eyes.

     Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face.
     There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus.
     But the dying man smiles at the sight before him.

                              ANAKIN (very weak)
               Now...go, my son. Leave me.

                              LUKE
               No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you
               here. I've got to save you.

                              ANAKIN
               You already have, Luke. You were right about
               me. Tell your sister...you were right.

                              LUKE
               Father...I won't leave you.

     Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.

     A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and,
     half carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles
     toward a shuttle.

131  EXT DEATH STAR                                                131

     The Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the
     immense superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel
     Star Cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station. And
     each direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction
     explosions within the station itself.

132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS                 132

     Lando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the
     dashing Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main
     reactor shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of
     the Falcon.

                              WEDGE
               There it is!

                              LANDO
               All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator
               on the north tower.

                              WEDGE
               Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

     The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires
     several proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series
     of small explosions.

     The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously
     close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon
     with a powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main
     reactor.

     He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just
     ahead of the continuing chain of explosions.

133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               133

     Ackbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,
     watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main
     briefing room.

                              ACKBAR
               Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

134  EXT DEATH STAR                                                134

     An Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out
     of the main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star
     is blown away.

     Finally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando
     expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and
     whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death
     Star supernovas into oblivion.

135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                               135

     Lando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.

136  EXT ENDOR FOREST                                              136

     Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks
     all look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final
     flash of self-destruction. They all cheer.

                              THREEPIO
               They did it!

     Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his
     face. Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a
     silent voice.

                              HAN
               I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it
               blew.

                              LEIA
               He wasn't. I can feel it.

                              HAN
               You love him, don't you?

     Leia smiles, puzzled.

                              LEIA
               Yes.

                              HAN
               All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes
               back, I won't get in the way.

     She realizes his misunderstanding.

                              LEIA
               Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my
               brother.

     Han is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.

137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT                                      137

     Luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where
     his father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet.
     He stands, watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume
     Darth Vader -- Anakin Skywalker.

     In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above
     the forest.

138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT                               138

     A huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels
     and Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating,
     singing, dancing, and laughing in the communal language of
     victory and liberation.

     Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie.
     Then, finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and
     embrace him. They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort
     in each other's touch, together to the end.

     Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The
     original group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke
     seems distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

     He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling
     figures at the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin
     Skywalker.
