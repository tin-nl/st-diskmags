     The boundless heavens serve as a back-drop for the MAIN TITLE,
     followed by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.

               Episode VI:

               RETURN OF THE JEDI...
               Luke Skywalker has returned to his home
               planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue
               his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the
               vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.

               Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC
               EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a
               new armored space station even more powerful
               than the first dreaded Death Star.

               When completed, this ultimate weapon will
               spell certain doom for the small band of
               Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the
               galaxy...

     PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its
     massive superstructure curling away from the completed section
     like the arms of a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast,
     floats the small, green moon of ENDOR.

     An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive
     armored space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A
     small Imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and
     hustles toward the Death Star.

     The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.

                              SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
               Command station, this is ST 321. Code
               Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach.
               Deactivate the security shield.

                              DEATH STAR CONTROLLER
                              (filtered VO)
               The security deflector shield will be
               deactivated when we have confirmation of your
               code transmission. Stand by... You are clear
               to proceed.

                              SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
               We're starting our approach.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM                                   3

     Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR
     hits switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the
     Death Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the
     invisible deflector shield.

     A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.

                              OFFICER
               Inform the commander that Lord Vader's
               shuttle has arrived.

                              OPERATOR
               Yes, sir.

     The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the
     Imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of
     Imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY                               4

     The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident
     technocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of
     the shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy
     about the new arrival. But the Death Star commander stands
     arrogantly tall.

     The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only
     darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From
     this black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader
     looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

                              JERJERROD
               Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.
               We're honored by your presence.

                              VADER
               You may dispense with the pleasantries,
               Commander. I'm here to put you back on
               schedule.

     The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

                              JERJERROD
               I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working
               as fast as they can.

                              VADER
               Perhaps I can find new ways to
               motivate them.

                              JERJERROD
               I tell you, this station will be operational
               as planned.

                              VADER
               The Emperor does not share your
               optimistic appraisal of the situation.

                              JERJERROD
               But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

                              VADER
               Then perhaps you can tell him when he
               arrives.

                              JERJERROD (aghast)
               The Emperor's coming here?

                              VADER
               That is correct, Commander. And he is most
               displeased with your apparent lack of
               progress.

                              JERJERROD
               We shall double our efforts.

                              VADER
               I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The
               Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE                           5

     A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine
     terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply
     before catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making
     their way along the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the
     Hutt.

                              THREEPIO
               Of course I'm worried. And you should be,
               too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
               never returned from this awful place.

     Artoo whistles timidly.

                              THREEPIO
               Don't be so sure. If I told you half the
               things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt,
               You'd probably short-circuit.

     The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, are you sure this is the right place?
               I better knock, I suppose.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE                                       6

     Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then
     timidly knocks on the iron door.

                              THREEPIO (instantly)
               There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's
               go back and tell Master Luke.

     A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery
     mechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops
     out and inspects the two droids.

                              STRANGE VOICE
               Tee chuta hhat yudd!

                              THREEPIO
               Goodness gracious me!

     Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd
               mischka Jabba du Hutt.

     The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then
     the eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo
     beeps his concern.

                              THREEPIO
               I don't think they're going to let us in,
               Artoo. We'd better go.

     Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly
     the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH.
     The robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids
     look at one another, afraid to enter.

     Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his
     stubby companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really
               don't think we should rush into all this.

     Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY                                    7

     The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the
     dark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant,
     green GAMORREAN GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances
     quickly back at the two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One
     guard grunts an order. Artoo beeps nervously.

                              THREEPIO
               Just you deliver Master Luke's message and
               get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.

     Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a
     humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

                              BIB
               Die Wanna Wanga!

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a
               message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

     Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

                              THREEPIO (cont)
               ... and a gift.
               (thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
               Gift, what gift?

     Bib shakes his head negatively.

                              BIB
               Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

     Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a
     bit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to
     the strange-looking alien.

                              THREEPIO
               He says that our instructions are to give it
               only to Jabba himself.

     Bib thinks about this for a moment.

                              THREEPIO
               I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so
               stubborn about these sort of things.

     Bib gestures for the droids to follow.

                              BIB
               Nudd Chaa.

     The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness,
     trailed by the two guards.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM                                         8

     The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque
     CREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem
     very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber.
     Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib
     Fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the
     leader of this nauseating crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of
     the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a
     maniacal grin. Chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful
     alien female dancer named OOLA. At the foot of the dais sits an
     obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers
     something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba laughs
     horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows
     politely.

                              THREEPIO
               Good morning.

                              JABBA
               Bo Shuda!

     The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-
     skinned villain.

                              THREEPIO
               The message, Artoo, the message.

     Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,
     creating a HOLOGRAM of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over
     ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space
     gangsters.

                              LUKE
               Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce
               myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and
               friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are
               powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger
               with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an
               audience with Your Greatness to bargain for
               Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your
               wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an
               arrangement which will be mutually beneficial
               and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
               confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I
               present to you a gift: these two droids.

     Threepio is startled by this announcement.

                              THREEPIO
               What did he say?

                              LUKE (cont)
               ... Both are hardworking and will serve you
               well.

                              THREEPIO
               This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the
               wrong message.

     Luke's hologram disappears.

     Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               There will be no bargain.

                              THREEPIO
               We're doomed.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               I will not give up my favorite decoration. I
               like Captain Solo where he is.

     Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the
     throne. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw
     him last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still
               frozen in carbonite.
