=====================


Charly Lownoise & Mental Theo
  - Charlottenburg -

Yes! Finally the famous house duo has released an album. Their 3 singles
("Wonderful days," "Together in wonderland," "Stars") were big hits in The
Netherlands and now they are also going to score in the rest of Europe (I hope).
Charlottenburg is a great album with 14 extremely good Hardcore and Rave tracks,
like The ultimate sex track, Live at London etc. So, if you are a hardcore or 
rave lover it will be worth to buy it.

 Technohead
- Headsex -

Never heard of them until they released their single "I want to be a hippie." 
And now they've released their album "Headsex." I wanna be a hippie has been 
a big hit in Holland and is currently hitting the charts in Germany and 
Belgium.The Album is full of fine hardcore tracks and is worth to buy it when 
you like the sound of hardcore...

  Dune
- Dune -

It's raving time!
Probably the best rave music there is, bells and a hard rhythm. Including the 
hits "Hardcore vibes" and "Are you ready to fly" makes this album a fine 
masterpiece of rave music...

- And the beat goes on... -

"Take of your shirts and wait for further instructions" If you like happy music,
this is the one. Most tracks are happy, like "Endless summer," "Waiting for 
spring" and "Move your ass!", but there are also some calm tracks like "Rhapsody
in E"... This album is a good one for the rave lovers.

Info:
And the beat goes on... by Scooter

Edel


The Chemical brothers
- Exit planet Dust -

Formally known as the Dust Brothers, they've released their album and I must say
it's a good one. It's some sort of ambience music. If you listen to it, it 
almost goes on in one blow, the songs are detached to each other. If you like 
Bomb the Bass, you'll probably like this one too. Excellent...

        Moby
- Everything is wrong -

A very good album by the animal lover called Moby. There are some techno tracks
like Feeling so real, some metal tracks like all that I need is to be loved and 
there are the calm tracks like into the blue. So for every taste there's a 
song.

Info:
Everything is wrong by Moby

Sabam


          The Prodigy
- Music for the jilted generation -

The masters of the dance music are back. This is an excellent album with some 
good dance tracks like "No good," "Voodoo people" and "Speedway" and the more 
Bomb the Bass styled tracks like "3 kilos'"and "Poison."

Info:
