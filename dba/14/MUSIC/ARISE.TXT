Mental Food

                         --- Mental Food ---
                         
I always thought that if you where a Hard-rock fan, you would have as much 
teeth than brain-cells. But lately I'm listening quite often to some louder 
music than I used to. 

This Idea scared me. To settle my concious I found out that the texts which 
are screaming out of the speaker where quite intellectual. You could consider 
these as mental food (It would not be wise, but you could.)

So here is some (mental) food from:

                          S E P U L T U R A
From their CD:
                                ARISE

                                Arise

Obscured by the sun
Apocalytpic Clash
Cities fall in ruin
Why must we Die?

Obliteration of mankind
Under a pale grey scky
We shall arise...

I did nothing, saw nothing
Terrorist confrontation
Waiting for the end
Wartime conspiracy

I see the world --- Old
I see the world --- Dead

Victims of war, seeking some salvation
Last Wish, Fatality
I've no land, I'm from nowhere
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Face the enemy 
Manic thoughts
Religious intervention
Problems remain

Lyrics: Max

                         Dead Embryonic Cells

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratatory Sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

A world full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

We're born
With pain
No more
We're Dead
Embryonic Cells

Corrosion inside -- We feel
Condemned future -- We see
Emptiness calls  -- We hear
Final premonition-- The truth

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everthing so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born with pain
Suffer remains      We're born 
With pain      Suffer 
Remains
We're dead

Lyrics: Max

                            Desperate Cry

Sacrifice is pleasure
When life ends in pain
Conceive the last mistake
Which belongs to all

Creation of insane rule
All we hear:
Desperate cry

Death the coldest wind
Seeps into your pores
A nation born of hate
Forgotten distant time

Creation of insave rule
All we hear:
Desperate cry

Endless empty maze
Despair, Distress, and Silence
A poison, vacuum, infinity
Life, lies, deceit

Mute souls end in silence
Oceans tainted with blood
Empty promises of hope
buried deep, infected ground

Creation of insane rule
all we hear:
Desperate cry

Cry!

Lyrics: Andreas

                                Murder

Chaotic violence in my eyes
This whole world moves backwards
Peace, another sign that lies
Life today is not worth the pain

On the radio, another homicide
Inmates suffocate in jail
Severed heads of revolt
I wish I'd never been born

Same hand that builds --- Destroys
Same hand that relieves --- Betrayes
Same hand that seeds --- Burns
Sane peace that exists --- Here lies

I can't trust anymore
Criminals within the law
I have something to say
Where I live, don't believe in another day

Heresy and graft
Apartheid
Same religion that saves --- Damns you!

Lyrics: Max

                             Subtraction

First generation born
A plague was created
The cure is in my mind
Solitude is all I see

Powerful nations repress feeling
Buried beneath the fear
Making you a coward
buying your safety

Grey shadows fill your head
Stealing your last breath
Scared of the future
Prophecies of chaos

Subtraction of personality
Within the human race
You'll always be

Green castles from the past
Bleeding in sands of war
No man is immortal
History is no more

Confused leaders behind our backs
Stifling our ideas
Misunderstand signs of progress
Minds of time regress

Searching for on answer
To understand myself
Lyrics: Andreas
                            Altered State

Fear in my subconscious
Terror invades my speech
Faith in my own words
No one knows the nameless

Warm winds and burning tears
Spirits outside bodies

Endless repression by majority
A master without command
Strange new dimensions disturbing my brain
Censored ideas, counterfeit answers

Shining blast, no perception
Altered state, no reaction
Shining blast
Altered state

Slow talk, fast thoughts
Ancient scriptures
Controversial Lines
Knowledge changes

Running in the wrong direction
Crossing with blind eyes
I'm closer to myslef
Sanity can't invade

Lyrics: Andreas

                      Under Siege (Regnum Irae)

The dural substance of christ
The yearning so human
Of man to attain god
Has always been a deep
Inscrutable mystery to me
My principle anguish and source
Of all my joys and sorrows

Religious domain is all I see
suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing your fate
Anno domini ends --- Misery

From my youth onward
Has been the incessant
Merciless battle between
The spirit and the flesh
And my soul is the arena
Where these two armies
Have clashed and met

Holy wars unleashing bloody raids
The sacred earth without a face
Consumed by murderous sinners
Psychotic leader
Insane--Insane--Insane--Insane!


Living in a dying age
Persecute the human race
Triumph of death in the wasteland
Blood signs your eptaph

Religious domain is all I see
Suffocate the scum with mediocrity
Lying and changing yyour fate
Anno domini ends --- Misery

Lyrics: Andreas

                        Meaningless Movements

Born with remorse
To a cold barren place
Battle between minds
Hungry for words of prey

Contradiction of truth
Secrets in lies
Meaningless movements

Icon Review their sins
Faith cheaper than thou
Doubting your ideals
Torment shreds your brain

Fearful fantasy respects the unknown
turning your heart red
A requiem to celebrate... You

Words I can not understand
Shrieks in my moment of pain
Imposter hides behind a mask
My words against your lies

Turn my head
To see what I know
A shadow without form
Painted on the wall

Born with remorse
To a cold barren place
Battle between minds
Hungrey for words of prey

One moments mistake
False steps in the ground
Laws made by the blind
ruling reign of light

Contradictory truth
Secrets in Lies
Meaningless movements

Lyrics: Andreas





                            Infected Voice

Fear ties you up
And you don't grow
Being wrong and lost
No one admits the defeat

Conscience is fair
Unfaithful words
Betrayal and greed
Past thoughts to win alone

Envy -- Still strong
Hatred -- Still alive

From beyond -- An empty world
Infected voice -- A scream alone

Infected voice!

My throat is dry
A last cry tries to escape
Guilt and frustration
No itme to turn around

Looking behind I'm not alone
Are the friends or enemies?
Going insane without a cure
Scarring my eyes, vision lost

Remorse for the human race
Fear of becoming them
Envy the strongest feeling
Hatred still in their heart

Envy -- Still strong
Hatred -- Still alive

From beyond -- An empty world
Infected voice -- A scream alone

Infected voice!

Lyrics: Andreas

Fortunatly I was right. My concious is now at ease. (I have much less brain-
cells than teeth.)

 
O.T.M.
