This CD contains a compilation of alternative rock tracks. It is an American
compilation featuring hits that are not that known in Europe. As always with
these compiles you wind up with songs that you already have or do not like. 
On with the track list:

Love Spreads             - The Stone Temple Pilots
Epic                     - Faith No More
Disarm                   - Smashing Pumpkins
Bang and Blame           - R.E.M.
I Alone                  - Live
Inside                   - Stiltskin
Longview                 - Greenday
Undone-The Sweater Song  - Weezer
She don't Like Jelly     - The Flaming Lips
Motorcycle Emptiness     - Manic Street Preachers
Creep                    - Radiohead
Two Princes              - Spin Doctors
Demagogue                - Urban Dance Squad
Reverend Black Grape     - Black Grape
You Could Be Mine        - Guns  n Roses
Positive Bleeding        - Urge Overkill
I Turned Out A Punk      - Big Audio Dynamite

As you can see the offer is diverse and it is certainly worth buying(if you dig 
it). My favourite tracks on this one are: Stone Temple Pilots, Faith No More,
Live, Stiltskin, Greenday, Radiohead and Reverend Black Grape(good). Just for 
the record ...

ARTIST/BAND         : Bruce Springsteen
TITLE               : Greatest Hits
GENRE               : Rock  n Roll
TOTAL PLAYING TIME  : 70+ minutes
TRACKS              : 18
 
They often refer to Bruce Springsteen as the 'Boss' of Rock 'n Roll. He is an
important character on the music scene and belongs to the absolute top. The last
few years he has not scored that many hits and he starts to fade away a bit.
About seven/eight years ago(don't pin me down on that)he had a tremendous
amount of hits in a row. All these can be found on the CD. Including what some
people call the best Rock 'n Roll song of all times 'Born to Run' It is also one
of my all time favourites. 

Time for the track list:

Born to Run           Brilliant Disguise
Thunder Road          Human Touch
Badlands              Better Days
The River             Streets of Philadelphia
Hungry Heart          Secret Garden
Atlantic City         Murder Incorporated
Dancing in the Dark   Blood Brothers
Born in the U.S.A.    This Hard Land
My Home Town
Glory Days

One little thing always bothers me with these greatest hits' CDs. The singer is
not dead yet! I mean he could score several new ones and then you have to buy
another compile CD. The record companies are only there for the money ...

ARTIST/BAND         : Greenday
TITLE               : Dookie
GENRE               : Rock
TOTAL PLAYING TIME  : 50+ minutes
TRACKS              : 13

Greenday is new star in the constellation and they are rising fast. They scored
three hits and got a high selling CD. You could describe the band's music as
rough and honest rock. 'Dookie' is to my knowledge their first CD, and most of
the time with these bands the first one is the best. After that, the record
company comes in and takes off the rough edges to make it sounds more 
commercial. I sure hope that they leave this band in its original state.

Here is the track list:

Burnout                  Sassafras Roots
Having a Blast           When I Come Around
Chump                    Emenius Sleepus
Welcome to Paradise      In the End
Pulling Teeth            F.O.D.
Basket Case              Longview
She

Although Greenday sounds rough there is a great concern for melody not often
heard from bands like this. I like almost all of the tracks but my favourite is
Basket Case. If you love alternative rock, then rent/buy it and listen for
yourself.

ARTIST/BAND         : Marillion
TITLE               : Afraid of the Sunlight
GENRE               : Psycho Rock
TOTAL PLAYING TIME  : 51+ minutes
TRACKS              : 8

I mentioned by Genre that it is Psycho Rock, that's not right but I completely
forgot the real term. Well, Marillion is a in the same business as Pink Floyd
music wise, but I still prefer Pink Floyd. Since Fish, Marillion's ex-leadsinger
got solo, things where never quite the same again. It took a long while before
Marillion finally returned in the charts. Most of their hits where ballads and
'Beautiful' is no exception on that rule. 

Track record:

Cannibal Surf Baby
Beautiful
Afraid of the Sunrise
Out of this World
Afraid of the Sunlight
Beyond You
King

I am not impressed with this CD I as heard better stuff before. Somewhere a
copy of 'A Jester's Tear' must be in my music collection. This album is far
superior to 'Afraid of the Sunlight' I think. The only thing I really like was 
the intro to 'Beautiful' at the end of track one. A woman speaks French(which I
find a poetic language, although I can't understand a thing)and then the first
sounds of 'Beautiful' start. Although the new singer has the looks and a good
voice, the CD is below par. NEXT!

ARTIST/BAND         : Aerosmith
TITLE               : big Ones
GENRE               : Rock
TOTAL PLAYING TIME  : 76+ minutes
TRACKS              : 16

This band is without doubt one of the biggest Rock 'n Roll bands at the
moment. After a past of boose and drugs they decided to clean up their act and
start a new. This second attempt was a very successful one and saw many hits.
What really is strange is that 'Big Ones' misses some hits from their first
period. The band was rougher at first but the sound is far more commercial
and smoother now. But lets face it that seems the only way to gain success.

Aerosmith clips always feature gorgeous young women. I seem to recall that the
blond girl is the daughter of Steven Tyler (leadsinger). She is certainly the 
girl I would want to get stuck with on a deserted island(Grin). Okay lets take 
a look at the tracks:

Walk on the Water        Blind Man 
Love in the Elevator     Deuces are Wild
Rag Doll                 The Other Side
What it Takes            Crazy
Dude(Looks like a Lady)  Eat the Rich
Janie's got a Gun        Angel
Cryin'                   Livin' on the Edge
Amazing                  Dude(Looks like a Lady) live

I'm not a really big Aerosmith fan but I do like this compilation of hits. Again
if you dig this stuff, run and buy ...
