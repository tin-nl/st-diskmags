D.B.A. on the Net
=================

Foreword

~SMWOMAN.BLK~                  Yes, it's incredible (cheering crowds, stage-
                               diving people, fainting girls) D.B.A. is on the 
                               Net! We couldn't stay behind in the Internet 
                               hype and decided to become also a psychical part 
                               of it. 

                               The D.B.A. homepage is regularly updated and 
                               expanded with new pages. We are working on more 
                               graphics to enhance the presentation. The next 
                               step is to include several links to other scene 
                                crews on the Net ...  
 

                               What do we offer?

                               A peek at the contents of an issue 
                               before its release. 
                                News about forthcoming projects. 
                                 General information and more ...





Plans

Plans are made to transform D.B.A. homepage into a Magnetic Interlude page.
This means that Maggie, D.B.A. and maybe even ST News will join forces to
create a comprehensive information site. Work is in progress!
