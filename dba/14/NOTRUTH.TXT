         First of all, I think it's wise to express my respect for
         christianity once more. Christianity has brought the 
         western world a lot of good things, but it nowadays
         suffers from a self-inflicted intoxication called 
         tradition. Holding on very strongly to age-old traditions
         that can hardly make good measureflags for todays' society
         is not very realistic in any sense of the word.
                                                                  
         Now I'd like to answer Sandman's article. You say you're
         happy that someone read your article. I think there are a 
         lot more besides me who have read it, and anyone who has 
         an interesting opinion on the subject and feels like 
         contributing something to the discussion is very welcome 
         to do so. 
         
         I never said that anyone shouldn't write about Jesus or 
         anything else. I am trying to make clear that this diskmag
         just isn't the right place to spread any gospel. Juha 
         thinks that the gospel of Jesus is beginning to bother me.
         Let me tell you one thing, Juha. I know enough about the 
         gospel of Jesus not to be bothered by it at all. 
         Christianity forbids the use of contraceptives (like 
         condoms), causing 12 year old girls to get pregnant and 
         to bear children. Isn't that strange? A 'religion of love'
         causing inmeasurable pain for small children. I do not
         even wish to think about taking part in such a religion.
         
         Now, let's get straight to the point: Juha says he knows 
         that Jesus is a real person. So why can't I sense him? 
         Because I do not accept his gospel? But would I be able to
         sense him if I did accept his gospel? Probably yes, but 
         when I was 4 years old I really believed I could hear the
         Smurfs talking in my room once it got dark, but that does 
         not mean they really exist. The next point. Jesus died for
         all our sins. Don't give me this crap. How could he have 
         died for MY SINS if I committed them some two thousand 
         years after he died? And if you mean to say that Jesus 
         died for our ancestor's sins which we have inherited, I
         must strongly disagree with you because I do not believe
         that I have anything to do with my family more than say 
         four generations ago. And Jesus also seems to be the only
         one able to save us from eternal punishment? So someone 
         who has lived a very good life but has never heard of 
         Jesus will go to hell? Together with Nelson Mandela, the
         Dalai Lama, Malcolm X, Shaquille O'Neal and some four
         billion others? I don't think so.
         
         The truth doesn't change because someone can't accept it.
         Absolutely right Juha, but did you ever think about 
         accepting something apart from your own view? And your 
         argument that the bible itself proves that it contains
         truth is as weak as can be. If I'd say that I could fly 
         like a bird, would you believe me? No, and even if anyone 
         would be stupid enough to believe me in this case, it 
         wouldn't be the truth, and it it never will be, no matter
         how many people would believe me.
         
         Juha asked me if I'm free. And as I referred to moral 
         freedom earlier on in the discussion, I will restrict 
         myself to that freedom only. I am absolutely free,
         morally. There is no one in the world who can force me to
         believe anything I do not want to believe. My mind is my
         own, I do not allow anyone to tell me what to think. And 
         I am happy to be in a situation like this, having to 
         decide for myself what is right and what is wrong. It is 
         YOU, Juha, who is a moral prisoner. You take a set of 
         rules from a certain community and live by them. Did you
         ever think about the value of your rules, why they are 
         there and if they're good or evil? I sure have thought a
         lot about mine, but then again, they're exclusively mine.
         At least I don't need no guidance. I am an individual.
         
         There is another fundamental problem I have with religion
         and the church. If there is a God figure, and he would be
         of a good nature, why would he want his creation to obey
         and honour him? And not humanity itself? In a sense, you
         can be very religious but a complete jerk to other people
         and still believe to go to the christian heaven. This is 
         a very shortsighted view of the world. What is more 
         important to you, the whole heaven and hell thing or the 
         real world?
         
         By the way, Juha, do you really believe eternal life is 
         important to me? Do you think I want to live forever? Get
         real. If I'd live forever, I would've accomplished all my 
         goals one day and life would be incredibly boring. Eternal
         life isn't a great gift, it's an extremely severe 
         punishment that I would not in any way want to 
         experience.
         
         If nobody preaches, who may believe?
         If nobody preaches, how many more people would form their
         own opinion?
         
         And another one to think about:
            Religion is said to be a good thing.
            War is said to be an evil thing.
            Therefore I don't understand religious wars.
         
         Well, I look forward to the answer, greets to all the guys
         (or girls (or whatever)) reading this.
