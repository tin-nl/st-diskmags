THE OFFICIAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE ATARI FALCON SCENE V1.1
=========================================================
                Done by Slimer

This is V1.1 of the Falcon Scene Encyclopedia. Several changes took place in 
the ever turbulent Falcon scene. New alliances and groups were formed and 
others disappeared. Read this second update for the latest ... 

One last thing, I tried to make an accurate list but don't get mad if some
data is incorrect or a group is missing. It's quite hard to make a decent
roundup. This list will be published in every forthcoming D.B.A. diskmag,
so if something is incorrect than send us the right data and I will update
the list. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some explanations:

We have the following order of data on the groups,

NAME    : Name of the group or individual.
MEMBERS : First the number of members (are estimated by insufficient 
          information) and their (or only the known)names.
REMARKS : The type of group and additional background information when       
          available. 
PRODUCTS: Only programs released on the Falcon to date.

STATUS  : Active       - If they recently have released a new production.
          Sleeping     - If no new productions are released but the crew
                         still exist (i.e. attend to parties or show other
                         signs of life).
          Dead         - Well that's obvious.

The overall data on groups and it's members are calculated with the lowest 
figure (i.e. 4/5 members, we use 4 to be save). members of dead/sleeping groups 
don't get counted (logically). Individuals (no member of democrew) are counted 
by the amount of members of active groups.
