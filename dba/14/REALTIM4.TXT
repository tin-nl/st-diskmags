RiCH here - I've had an idea... DESERT ISLAND DISKS - If you could
take only three disks away with you to a desert island (with your
ST/Falcon of course) what three disks would you take and why??????
Ok VoGue - you first....

1. Adult Erotica disk mag

Hmmm very nice... ok Tat over to you... what would you take?

1. Devpac saddo's disk
2. Ooh Crikey What A Scorcher
3. Blank disk with the Ghost virus (hours of funless end)

Ghost virus?  Okay.... :-)  Right, my choices now (RiCH!)...

1. Apex Media so I can draw and draw and draw in True Colour
2. Edith so I can type out whatever I want &

2. ST Format Cover Disk Issue 13 (unlucky for some) 
3. Atari Basic Disk (as its makes an excellant frisbe to play with
when I get feed up with the above two disks).

Vogue... We are now compiling the Falcon version of Maggie 18 at 1.35
am on 20.8.95

We are now COPYING the F030 version of Maggie 18.....

I'm very pleased now I have the final version of Maggie 18 on
disk..it'll be uploaded VERY soon indeed to Demon...yes,
ftp.demon.co.uk....pub.atari.diskmags.

My final greets before I go are as follows [this is Felice here, BTW]

CiH, Leon, Tash (asleep), Kev (asleep), Gareth (loudly snoring...I
presume he's also asleep), RiCH (semi-asleep), Tat, Mike Noyce (who
seems to be bright and awake), Del & Thelma.....hope the wedding
anniversary went OK, Joanna Pacula, Meredith Salenger, Corey Feldman,
Corey Haim, Beavis & Butthead.

Greets also fly from here to the town called Taunton, where James
seems to have been stuck to .... when's the wedding, James??

And with that I'll sign off.  I love you Meredith!!!!!!!!

Vogue.... Thanks for that Felice... *greatly* appreciated...

We may well be approching the end of this real time article as
everyones very tired and we've copied Maggie umpteen times....

Felice was certified shortly after writing this docfile (2.07am.)

We decided on a mass signing off session (of those who are still
awake!) to end this file....

Be happy, suck slapppy, and shut thy trap! VoGue...
