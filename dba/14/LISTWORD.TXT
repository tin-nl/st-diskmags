        EXPLANATION OF USED COMPUTER TERMS IN THIS MAGAZINE

Re-edited version

There are many "unknown" words in this magazine for some people who are
not familiar with certain computer terms.  You will find a short list with
the most used words from the computer scene (there are many more but I
decided to do only the important ones). We reach many people who don't
know that there is a computer scene or just don't participate on the
scene. So, when those people start to read this magazine they stumble on
words that they never have heard of. For those people we made the follo-
wing list:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coder             : Is a programmer.

GFX-man           : An artist that creates graphics with aid of the        
                    computer(see GFX).

Music-man         : Someone who composes music with aid of a computer
                    (see musax).

Cracker           : Someone who removes protections out of programs.

Hacker            : Someone who breaks into computer systems often using
                    a modem. 

Swapper           : Someone who trades computer programs with other        
                    people mostly by mail.

Modem trader       : Someone who swaps programs with the aid of a modem.

Ripper            : That's a guy who steals/takes code/music and graphics  
                    for use in his own demo or intro.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code              : Code is just another word for a program or piece of    
                    program language.

Routines          : Small piece of code that performs a specific task like
                    playing a module or showing a picture.

Scrolline         : Line of text that scrolls horizontal/vertical over     
                    your screen.

GFX               : Grafix or just Graphics which means drawings and 
                    pictures on the computer screen.

Piccy/pic         : Picture.

Vector            : Lines that can form objects on your screen.

Filled Vectors    : The same objects but then they are filled with colors.

Texture mapped    : Pictures/graphics that are used on/as walls/objects in 
                    games and demo's. Something like wallpaper.

Logo              : The logo of the group who created an intro/demo, game  
                    or for instance a diskmagazine. logo is a recognition  
                    sign just like the one of a firm/company.

Distorted         : A waving effect(moving screen lines).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Musax             : This is of course music and can be parted in 3        
                    different forms,
      
Chipmusic         : This is music that is composed on the built in Yamaha 
                    soundchip of a 'ordinary' ST.

Module            : This is music made up of small samples like a drumbeat
                    a guitar Riff and many other small pieces. These small 
                    samples can get sequenced. All those little samples    
                    are forming a soundtrack which is called a module(also     
                    known as mod.). This is the most popular form of music 
                    because the quality is good and through the use of small  
                    samples the module stays small.

Samples           : A piece of sound that is "recorded" with a sound-
                    sampler. The height of the sampling rate (kHz.) is      
                    related to the quality of the recorded sound. 
                    Disadvantage of a high sampling rate is the enormous   
                    flow of data. With a Falcon sampling a 20 seconds of   
                    music at 50 kHz you will wind up with many megabytes   
                    of data ! 


Sequenced samples : Repeating of samples in a music piece and thus saving
                    precious memory. For instance if the same guitar Riff  
                    appears 4 times in a music piece, you only have to     
                    record it once. This technique is also used in modules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lamer             : Someone who doesn't belong on the scene and is not     
                    part of some kind of (well) known computer group. It 
                    also could simply be an unpleasant person. 

Greetings         : A form a recognition that other groups know you.

Fuckings          : The opposite of greetings, often sprouted from 
                    competition or the ripping of code/graphs/music.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mag.              : Magazine (can be either paper or digital).

Diskzine          : Diskmagazine (see Diskmagazine)

Diskmagazine      : Digital magazine on a computer floppydisk, often 
                    containing articles and programs. Advantages in
                    comparison with a paper magazine are,

                    Low costs to make
                    Small & compact (fits in your pocket)
                    Interactive 
                    Contains music 
                    It's Public Domain (in most cases). 
                    Articles with good coding tips
                    Not restricted to any rules, 
                    free to express opinions of any kind

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      
Intro             : A piece of code ( presentation screen ) in front of a  
                    program. It's a series of effects/programming tricks   
                    accompanied by music. The difficulty rate, style,      
                    originality and execution of the performed tricks is    
                    what's important.
                    
(Mega)Demo        : Demonstration of effects/programming tricks. Demo's    
                    are mostly intro's accessible through a main-menu.

Dentro            : Something between an intro and a demo( without a 
                    main-menu ). Effects/tricks are shown in a preorderd   
                    sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packed/Crunched   : Programs that are made smaller to save disk space with 
                    a special (compression) packing program. If commands   
                    appear several times in a program, they get replaced   
                    for instance by one character. Space can also be  
                    compressed, all this leads to space saving. Good        
                    packers can compress certain programs more then 60     
                    percent or even higher !

Compil            : Compilation of many packed programs. Often compressing 
                    several diskfilling programs on one single disk. These
                    compils were very popular on the ST/STE, on the Falcon
                    however they are rare (for the time being). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pseudo name       : The codename of an individual computer freak on the    
                    scene. Pseudo names are mostly used by Hackers & Crackers
                    in order to cover up their real name for obvious reasons 
                    Other people who don't roam the illegal circuit use them
                    just for fun.

Crew/group        : Several mostly talented individuals forming a group.   
                    Their main goal is to code better programs than the    
                    competition or simply to have some fun. These groups   
                    also have names ( like for instance the D.B.A. ).

Alliance          : Many groups gathered in one big one, also under a name.
                    (like the Independent). Sometimes they produce big
                    megademos or other productions by joining forces.

Scene             : Gathering of active computer groups and individuals.   
                    Mostly elite coding groups or individuals. A parallel
                    world beside the normal computer circuit.

P.D.L.            : Public Domain Library ( Library filled with free       
                    or low cost software made by mostly non commercial 
                    individuals/groups ).
                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSP               : The Digital Signal Processor in the Falcon computer.   
                    This processor can perform tasks without disturbing    
                    the main-processor (68030). The DSP is especially       
                    designed to process digital information like samples,  
                    picture compression, speech recognition with incredible 
                    speed. It can also do other things as well, although   
                    it can't perform every task. The DSP is what makes the 
                    Falcon special ! There are three versions of this chip
                    a 16, 24 and 32 bit version. The Falcon has the special
                    24 bits one.

I hope you have enough information to make you understand most of the
articles in this magazine. Like I said before; there are many more words
that are being used on the scene but I just made a short list of the most
used ones. Now go and read some articles...........
