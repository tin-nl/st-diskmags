E.X. Illusion by Aura
=====================                      Hsun Tzoe

My approach toward demoreviews is slightly changed. I have decided not to
do any comprehensive reports anymore. There are several reasons for this; first
it is very hard to imagine something you haven't seen and secondly it saves
time. Besides, who reads these reviews except those who coded these demos'? 

Aura is not doing well right now as a group. Several members have quit
Falcon demo coding and are involved in other projects. BDCannibal is the only
active member left in the group. This is of course very sad to hear as Aura
belongs to the top demo crews. 
Bdcannibal was working on a 3D engine (something that seems popular these
days) but he couldn't find time nor motivation to further develop his code. He
decided to put the stuff he had into a dentro and called it "E.X. Illusion"

The dentro is basically a slide show of beautiful pictures/poems with some
marvelous effects between them. These effects lean heavy on 3D and range
from several spinning objects till unlimited Gouraud 3D cubes! Some scene's
however are not running smooth. There are some occasional hick ups here and
there. 

Throughout the dentro you will hear an excellent module by DOMM of
Animal Mine. He is without doubt one of the best composers on the Falcon right 
now. A lot of graphics come from the hand of JMS of Newline. The rather tasty 
plasma pictures are done by Herm of the Mugwumps who did also a color
cycle scene in this dentro. All poems who pass the revue are from Heinrich 
Heine although you won't get the chance to read them. Besides they are done in 
German ...

Conclusion

This dentro has some very good coding effects, music and excellent plasma-pics 
who give the dentro atmosphere. Highlights in this dentro are a giant
spinning Gouraud shaded cube, a 3D "world" with lots of moving/spinning objects 
and the 3D stars with the floating hot-air balloons. Most of the effects are 
real-time calculated with some additional help from the DSP. Quite an excellent 
demo ...

Some calculations from my part:

Code     : 8
Graphics : 8 (Could have been higher but most of it is "generated" graphics")
Music    : 8+(Excellent modules by DOMM) 

Overall  : 8



Bugs From outer Space by Impulse
================================

A little dentro by Swedish democrew Impulse made for Fried Bits party 3. It 
opens with a comet striking earth followed by some excellent mostly raytraced 
pics. There is a good module and one or two effects pass the screen. Before you 
know it, you're watching the end sequence of the dentro. A vertical scroller, 
seen millions of times before ...

Conclusion

Too short, not enough effects, not original and very boring. The raytraced pics 
are excellent and the module is okay, the rest is far below par ... 

Code     : 6-
Graphics : 7+ (For the raytraced pics)
Music    : 7  ( Nothing fancy) 

Overall  : 6+


Function Main by Therapy
========================

Another dentro made for the Fried Bits 3 convention. It starts with an excellent
opening part were a piece of background 'paper' burns from the top to the 
bottom. The next part is a screen that almost seems a complete rip off the 
Obnoxious demo by Inter. It's a vector cube with a shadow effect. 

I thought that the fractals were banned from demos' by now but, I was wrong. 
What follows are some 68030 calculated fractals and other related things.
Again, I would like to call upon the democrews to stop doing this boring stuff 
unless you have something really worthwhile! The next part is a Gouraud shaded
object and some fast object morphing followed by a colourful (cliche)plasma 
effect. 

The end part is the usual vertical scroller, standard effect of every demo these
days. I am not critizing vertical scrollers as I like them, although, a new way 
to end a demo would be pleasant! After exiting the dentro I was dropped in a 
3D desktop, pity I can't find my 3D glasses anywhere ...
 
Conclusion

Pretty straightforward dentro without any original effects. I hope that these 
dentro's will lead to better more spectacular demos' in the future. A dentro 
doesn't have to contain complicated effects to be original ...

Code     : 7-
Graphics : 7+ (For the nice burning paper)
Music    : 7+ (An okay module) 

Overall  : 7+

 
The Stupid O Demo by The Joyeux Loophocs

As the title already suggests, this is a stupid demo! It starts with a bunch of 
so called funny effects like a vertical scrolline, exploding words and more
nonsense. The main menu is a copy of ULMs "Dark Side of the Spoon." I do recall 
that ULMs original screen was much better on the ST. A module starts playing; 
several samples are taken from "DsotS" original mod.  

Just like in the "Dark Side of the Spoon" you have to control a little creature 
on his tour across several doors. Behind these doors are demo screens. It 
suddenly struck me that this old concept is not used anymore. There are only 
dentro's on the Falcon. Anyway, lets not wander of.  Regarding the main menu, 
there are only a few doors to choose from. 

The little demo screens all starts with a cartoon like picture and some info (in
French). All of the screens are boring as hell and contain hardly any decent
effects. However, they all have excellent modules! 
When you try to leave this wonderful production you get caught in the reset
part. There again a few cartoons like pics and  funny' stuff in French ...

Conclusion

This demo supposed to be funny, I love funny things but I didn't laugh for one
moment (maybe after a bottle of Plantiac;-)) The main menu occasionally
freezes after trying to leave the  demo'screens. Except the excellent modules,
there isn't much to keep you entertained for long ...   

Code     : 5+ 
Graphics : 5- (some ripped 16 color ST graphics)
Music    : 7+ (for the okay modules) 

Overall  : 5+
