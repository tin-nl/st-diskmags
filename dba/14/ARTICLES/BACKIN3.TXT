Recently I received a letter from France sent to me by a big Atari XL/XE fan. 
He wrote that there is still a very active XL/XE scene. It seems that the music 
on these 8-bit computers has evolved dramatically and cannot be compared with 
the early tunes. As a real Atari freak he wrote that Pokey beats SID (Grin). The
top demo's seem to come from Poland these days which is not that surprising. 
Many 8-bit computers get dumped in East Europe ...

I am completely out of touch with the XL/XE scene and assumed that it was 
dead(at least close to that). Well I'm glad that I was wrong. Although I own a 
Falcon these days, I still think of the 8-bit days as the best time. This all 
sounds a bit sentimental but owning a computer was something special in these 
days(14 years ago). Nowadays everybody has one and that spoils the fun a bit. 
The release of the "Video Classic Guide" by one the member of Reservoir Gods 
proves that many of us still long to these times.

I can't deny that I am very curious to see how much XL/XE coding has improved 
over the years. However I don't own an XL anymore and we have no decent emulators 
for the Falcon, so though luck.

That is all I am afraid there is no more. I was a bit naugthy (not anymore, 
honest) in those days and copied everything I got my hands on. I also 
bought several cartriges (Galaxian, Ice Hockey, Centipede, Star Raiders etc.)but 
they were quite expensive. I was already happy if I could afford to buy 
cassette's and later diskette's.

Many games were bought from pirates with revealing names like Boney and Clide. 
The other stuff was obtained through swapping and copying. It was cheaper than 
buying it. Good old times ...

Maybe till next time ...
