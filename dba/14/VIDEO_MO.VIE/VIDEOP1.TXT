Title               : True Lies
Genre               : Action
Total playing time  : 131 minutes

With                : Arnold Schwarzenegger as Harry Tasker
                      Jamie Lee Curtis as Hellen Tasker

Harry and Hellen Tasker are married for fifteen years. What Hellen does not
know is that Harry really is a secret agent instead of the computer salesman
he pretends to be. While Harry plays the convincing role of a computer
salesman, Hellen is becoming very bored. She is looking for action and meets
another man. This man convinces her that he is a secret agent (but he really is
a car salesman.)

While Hellen is fooling around, Harry is tracking a group of terrorists
planning to nuke parts of the U.S. Meanwhile he discovers that his wife is
seeing another man. Harry decides to give this fake secret agent and Hellen a
good scare. He and his team follow them to his house and kidnap them. Hellen
still does not know that her husband is behind all this. They interrogate her
and she admits that she still loves Harry. She also tells her kidnappers' of 
her boredom.

Harry decides that his wife needs some action in her life and sends her off on
a fake mission. Unfortunately the fake and real mission comes together and
then the fun really starts.

This movie features much humour and incredible special effects. There is a
part in this movie when Harry flies a Harrier, resulting in some mind
boggling stunts.  A great deal of computer wizardry is involved in this part. I
really enjoyed this one and I am sure you will also, so check it out if you have
not seen it ...

Title               : Babylon 5
Genre               : Sci-Fi
Total playing time  : 90 minutes

With                : Michael O'Hare as Commander Jeffrey Sinclair
                      Andreas Katsulas as Ambassador G'Kar
                      Mira Furlan as Ambassador Delenn

Babylon 5 is a space station that functions as a meeting place for aliens. There
are several ambassadors at the station to represent the different alien species.
They have planned an intergalactic convention. All the ambassadors are
already present except the ambassador of the Vorlons. 

When the Vorlon ambassador arrives he gets poisoned. He is slowly dying
from the poison but his superiors have rejected the help of the station's
doctors. The doctors decide to help him anyway.
One member of the crew has supernatural capabilities and manages to read
the mind of the sick Vorlon. She sees the assassin and recognizes him as the
commander of the station.  The commander is immediately relieved from his
duties.

An investigation reveals many strange happenings. Eventually they find out
that the assassin is able the morph. He can take all kinds of shapes ...

Babylon 5 is a bit based on the popular Star-Trek movies/series. The movie
contains good special effects. Personally I find the commander a bit of a wimp
so I prefer Jean Luc Pickard.  It stays amusing though ...

Title               : Babylon 5 "A voice in the Wilderness"
Genre               : Sci-Fi
Total playing time  : 85 minutes

With                : Michael O'Hare as Commander Jeffrey Sinclair
                      Andreas Katsulas as Ambassador G'Kar
                      Mira Furlan as Ambassador Delenn

In this story the Babylon crew discovers a lightbeam on the planet they are
orbiting. The planet contains no life according to the onboard sensors of the
space station. Somehow the lightbeam seems to work as a beacon.

An investigating ship is shot at by some a type of self-defense system. The
source of the lightbeam lies underneath the surface of the planet. A ship of the
Babylon manages to penetrate the artificial crater where the self-defense
system and the homing beacon are situated. They stumble on a very advanced
technology and a guardian.

Hostile spaceships appear on the scene lured by the homing beacon. From that
moment on things get very tense.

This is an even better episode of Babylon than the first one. There are again
very good special effects and there is more action in this one. I do have some
remarks about the so called advanced technology in this movie. They use
afterburners on their space ships, something that seems quite strange to me. I
do not think that they are burning fossil fuels in the far future, like in jet
engines ...

Title               : Star-Trek: Deep Space Nine
Genre               : Sci-Fi
Total playing time  : N/A

With                : Avery Brooks as Commander Benjamin Sisko
                 
                                      
"Deep Space Nine" is an episode of the many Star-Trek movies available
these days. This time it is not revolving around the Enterprise and its crew.
We follow other people of the "Federation." Once a while Jean Luc Pickard
will stick his head around a corner but that is really it. 

The story goes about Benjamin Sisko who becomes commander of a space
station(again a bloody space station). An unfriendly people have abandoned
the station called the Cardassians  They wrecked everything along with the
planet around which the station is orbiting. Sisko manages to get the whole
station operational again. Meanwhile he meets a strange priest who shows him
an even stranger orb, with a message that he is chosen for a special
assignment. 

It turns out that several of these orbs seem to exist. They come from another
dimension and just floated in space. He investigates the location where the
orbs were found and discovers an artificial wormhole. This wormhole is the
entry to another dimension.

The Cardassians are still near and pick up on the wormhole. A battle erupts
between both parties over the domination of this passage.

Overall, a good Sci-Fi movie in the style that we expect from the Star-Trek
makers. Deep Space Nine is not high standing, just good amusement.

Title               : Night watch: Operation Aurora
Genre               : Action
Total playing time  : N/A

With                : Lance Hendrikson
                      Bruce Payne

Two airliners crash under mysterious circumstances. A secret Aurora fighter
disappears. The government select their two best men to fly a reconnaissance
mission over the area where the plane was last seen. 

It turns out that a group of terrorists has managed to create an
electromagnetic beam that disables all electronic equipment onboard of a
plane. They send their beam via the Global Positioning Network(or whatever).

Things get quite hot when the reconnaissance Aurora fighter also gets
downed. The pilots get picked up by the terrorists and wind up in their H.Q.
From that moment on all hell breaks lose.

"Night watch" is one of the many videos' about fighter planes rescuing the
world. The video market saw a waterfall of these movies after the box-office
success "Top Gun." They are available in all flavours ranging from WWII till
Stealth planes. This one is average but still good fun to watch ...

Title               : The Getaway
Genre               : Action
Total playing time  : 115 minutes

With                : Alec Baldwin as Doc McCoy
                      Kim Bassinger as Carol McCoy


Doc and Carol McCoy are your modern Bonny and Clyde. Doc is the best
safe-cracker around and Carol usually drives the getaway car. They have a
partner who helps them pull off the jobs. On one day they get an assignment
to break a guy from jail and return him to his rich uncle. Things go sour and
their partner leaves them. Carol escapes but Doc winds up in jail and 
asks her to break him free.

His wife visits a gangster with connections to get Doc free. In return the
gangster asks Doc and Carol to knock over the safe where the money of
horse-races is kept. The gangster has also hired the old partner along with
another fellow. The old partner is planning to murder Doc and Carol
afterwards to get the money. Doc is already suspicious ...

From there on several events take place and the robbery turns into a getaway.
Doc and Carol try to flee to Mexico ... I will not reveal more, this will only
spoil the fun. The video has been number one on the video charts and is good
fun to watch.
Kim Bassinger is her own sexy self and plays several love scenes' in this video.
So, if you're a big fan of Kim, you shouldn't miss this one!

Title               : The Mask
Genre               : Comedy
Total playing time  : 101 minutes

With                : Jim Carrey as The Mask
                      Cameron Diaz as Stanley


Jim Carrey plays in "The Mask" a dull bank employee with little self-esteem.
A gorgeous woman visits the bank to open an account. Jim makes a complete
fool of himself, while the woman examines the security systems of the bank.
The woman works for a criminal organization with a very dangerous leader.

At one evening Jim gets car trouble on a bridge, while looking at the water, he
sees something that looks like a body. He jumps in and discovers that it is just
some junk, except a strange wooden mask. Back home he tries the mask and
turns into a green cartoon character with an enormous amount of confidence
and style. 

The mask enables him to do things before which he never dreamed of doing.
He needs money and robbes the bank just before the criminal organization
does. In the bank are security cameras that film him and the police are of
course very interested. Jim gets caught between the police and some
dangerous crooks who are looking for their money ...

"The Mask" is a very entertaining comedy where humour, cartoons and
action are nicely blended. Jim Carrey proves again that he is an excellent
comedian.
