                    *** A Midsummernight's Dream ***
                    
                    1. Memory
                    =========
                    Sitting here alone
                    No-one to touch my erogenous zone
                    Give me more
                    Of what happened the night before
                    Sitting on the beach
                    Beer and cigarettes within reach
                    Sitting on the bitch
                    Wanting me to scratch her itch
                    Going for speed
                    Speed is all I really need
                    
                    2. Dream
                    ========
                    The water was so cool
                    And she was so hot
                    All that I thought of
                    Was all I got
                    It felt like a dream
                    It was not
                    
                    3. Disturbed
                    ============
                    The cops came
                    I did the same
                    They disturbed our fun
                    Just after I'd shot my gun
                    
                    4. Unity
                    ========
                    No name
                    No status
                    No image
                    No age
                    No time
                    No sound
                    No enemies
                    Water
                    Sand
                    Drinks
                    Smokes
                    You
                    Me
                    Perfect unity.
                    
                    5. Square
                    =========                    
                    Was it really you and me
                    Or was it just a fantasy
                    You gave me what you got
                    I might say it was a lot
                    You were absolutely real
                    So real I can still feel
                    The bruises on my brains
                    Sensation bruising veins
