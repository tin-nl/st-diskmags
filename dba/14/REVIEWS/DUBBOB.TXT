           Yesterday evening, I had a 'nice' conversation with a
         'nice' person called Slimer (what a well-chosen pseudo he
         has, by the way). The lazy bum bored me for some two hours
         with his 'the-mag's-gonna-be-finished-next-week-so-hurry-
         up-will-you'-talk, finally getting me bored enough to say
         yes to any question he asked. One of the questions I can 
         recall was to write a review about Double Bubble 2000, the
         great game by Reservoir Gods. So here it is.
         
         
                         *** Double Bobble 2000 ***
         
         *** Loading the game
         My version came directly from Sparerib3 of Res Gods, as a
         zipfile. Installation is very easy (oh...) and the game 
         runs perfectly well from any place on the harddisk (ah..)
         or the floppy disk. Loading from the harddisk is quick, 
         and there's no loading during the game. Nothing unusual 
         here.
         
         *** First impression
         The intro looks quite cool, nice stereo effect, nice gfx,
         though the design could have been somewhat better. But
         I'm probably the only one who notices these kind of things
         anyway. I never read a manual before I play a game (who
         does?) and when I first saw the game I thought it was a 
         patched version of the original game. But a closer look 
         revealed the enhancements made.
         
         *** Second impression
         About the same as the first impression.
         
         *** Options
         The range of options on this game is about as broad as it
         gets. All types of control are possible (joystick, joypad,
         keyboard), one or two player select, sound modes etc. Well 
         done. 
         
         *** Playing the game
         The game is very straightforward to play. Your aim is to
         catch all the monsters on the screen in bubbles. You can 
         make these bubbles by pressing fire and then they fly from
         your monster horizontally in the direction your monster's
         turned to. If you don't catch the baddies fast enough, the
         evil Darren von Blubba(tm) will appear to haunt you. The 
         levels are very much like the levels in an old game called 
         Bubble Bobble, but other similarities between the two 
         games are rare (not). There are a lot of extras around to 
         be picked up, like extra lives, extra points and skipping 
         levels. Control is easy and the response is fast. It is 
         very pleasing to see a PLAYABLE platform game on the 
         Falcon. 
         
         *** Graphics
         Graphics are bright and colourful. The in-game graphics do
         their job, being both functional and good-looking. The 
         intro looks good, but it seems that the logos depend 
         heavily on GodPaint's special effects. The main menu looks
         very simple. Such a good game deserves a better
         presentation. That doesn't mean it's bad, no, it's good, 
         but it could've been better.
         
         *** Sound
         The music is good, but not special. Sound effects are well
         chosen and well used, I especially like the flushing 
         toilet.
         
         *** Verdict
         A good game, it's very visible that a lot of work went 
         into this one. Some minor flaws, but I am a _v_e_r_y_ 
         critical reviewer you know.
