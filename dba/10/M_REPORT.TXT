'COMPUTER SIMULATION' (Daily Mail. Wednesday, August 14, 1987.)

BILL REED: I'm talking this evening to JOHN TWEEDIE, who is the sales
   director of a company called Microprose Software, which is a company
   that makes and sells computer simulations and games.  John, can I ask
   you to tell me what the products are that Microprose makes ?
JT: Microprose develops a wide range of simulation programmes for numerous
   different computers.  By software simulation we mean a computer
   programme which enables you to be placed in the same atmosphere and
   scene and action and excitement as you would experience if you were
   given the job of a jet fighter pilot, a World War II Submarine captain,
   a civilian pilot, or possibly an English Spitfire pilot in World War II.
   We produce these simulations so that you feel the same sense of danger,
   excitement and challenge.
BR: OK.Now presumably people are playing these games or using these
   simulations with a screen in front of them that's telling them what to
   do, what their options are.
JT: That's right.  The computer programme is obviously displayed on a color
   monitor, that is the screen, in front of the player.  This screen will
   depict various scenes, for example you can be looking at what is the
   simulated environment of a Spitfire cockpit, with the controls directly
   in front of you, with the view out of the cockpit window, with the
   targets on the ground or maybe the targets in mid-air in front of you.
BR: And what sort of decisions might I have to make ?
JT: You have to absorb and manage vast quantities of information to make
   correct decicions.  Now those decisions will revolve around piloting
   your aircraft, safeguarding your co-pilot and your crew, ensuring that
   you return safely from your dangerous bombing mission, or your aerial
   dog-fight, and ensuring basically that you carry out the same functions
   as the man who would have done that job in real life.  Only you're safe
   sitting in the chair of your computer room.
BR: OK. So you're selling these to people who use them in their own home.
JT: We're selling to a wide range.  We sell to the children who will use
   them at home; children who will use them at school, as part of
   computer familiarisation; we sell them also to adults, who will use them
   at home and work for relaxation.  We can sell a very wide range of
   people, because they appeal to all age-groups.
BR: What would you say is the main appeal ?
JT: The main appeal is a sense of excitement,and the challenge of learning.
    I think when you first learn to ride your bicycle, when you're a very
    young child, this is a great achievement.  You get a similar sense of
    thrill when you have mastered the entire simulation, and come out on
    top as a winner.
BR: Can you give me an example of different simulations that are popular
   for different age-groups ?
JT: Yes, I can.  We have one simulation which revolves around the skills
   associated with air traffic control in a modern-day civilian airport.
   The product I have in mind is "Kennedy Approach", which revolves around
   Kennedy Airport, Kennedy International Airport in the United States.
   This appeals to the adults, because there is a vast amounts of
   information which have to be mastered, very intricate decisions which
   have to be taken, and you are totally responsible, over the time you're
   playing this simulation, for the lives of both the aircraft crew and
   thosde on the ground.  A very, very stressful occupation.
BR: OK. How about the teen-age age-group ?
JT: The younger element tend to be very, very attracted to our fighter-
   pilot simulations, our helicopter gunship simulations, where in addition
   to learning how to master your craft, you are also responsible for
   example bombing missions, reconnaissance missions.
BR: Are you not encouraging people to - um- react violently, to carry out
   dangerous missions and see themselves as self-made heroes ?
JT: I think in the safe confines of your armchair, that's something which
   we can all take part in.  There's a world of difference between sensing,
   for a brief moment, the thrill and the danger of these situations, and
   actually wanting to put this into practise in modern-day life.
BR: OK. How much do they cost, John ?
JT: To buy in the shops, for example on a Commodore 64 home computer, our
   product would cost L9.95 and L14.95 on disc format.  At the other end of
   the market, on the IBM personal computer, on disc our products sell at
   L24.95, which in relative terms is inexpensive.
BR: And how long would it take to play, to complete a simulation ?
JT: We've calculated, on average, 300 playing hours.
BR: So in fact every time the user is using it, he's using it at a
   different level of difficulty.
JT: That's right.  And achieving the same sense of satisfaction as he
   progresses from one level of achievement to the next.
BR: OK. Well thank you very much for talking to me, John, and I'll wish
   you the best of luck.
JT: Thanks very much.

Jovis: Thanks Billy, that was really boring !


  10 REMARKS :

- Nowadays   computer  simulations   are  not  so   realistic  ones   yet !

- Now  through  the  virtual  world   we  hope  to  feel  real  dangers ...

- Now journalists all know  the problems that make such games  on students.

- Now these games  are less complicated  because we want to have  real fun.

- Now we can find computer games  at school, even if it is still forbidden.

- Now it is still right  that difficult () games  appeal more to PC owners.

- Now as I said, games mustn't only procure stress,as it was on that time !

- Now young players are killing, blood licking, because they are stressed !

- Now C64 is replaced by the Sega (,..), and IBM has still the same market.

- Now  the  sense  of  satisfaction  is  always  reduced  by  the  prices !

+ Now it's game-over !
