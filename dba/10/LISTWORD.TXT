        EXPLANATION OF USED COMPUTER TERMS IN THIS MAGAZINE

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many "unknown" words in this magazine for some people who are not
familair with certain computer terms. 
You will find a short list with the most used words from the computer
scene( there are many more but I decided to do only the important ones ).
We reach many people who don't know that there is a computer scene or just
don't participate on the scene.
So, when those people start to read this magazine they stumble on words that
they never have heard of.
For those people we made the following list:

                 use in his own demo or intro.

                 a guitar piece and many other small pieces.

                 is called a module( also known as mod. ).
