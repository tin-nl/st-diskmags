DFC 1.20

What does DFC do?
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
DFC, an abbreviation of 'Desktop File Connector', does as it's name suggests: as
soon as you double click on any file that's not executable, the desktop will au-
tomatically run DFC, passing on the file's name. DFC then checks the extension
and runs the appropriate program. Which program is connected to which extension
is read from the DFC.INF file in the root directory of the bootdrive.
A big advantage is that a special key combination can be assigned to each con-
nected program. This can either be <Shift>, <Control>, <Alternate> or any combi-
nation of these. Let's say we assign <Shift> to our text editor and no key to
our text viewer. Now, when we double click on a text file, keeping <Shift>
pressed down (assuming we connected some extensions like .TXT and .DOC) it'll
be shown by the text EDITOR. But if we hadn't held down the shift key, we would
have had the textfile presented in the text VIEWER. This is also useful if you
regularly change .INF or .CFG files.


Features
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Here's a list of wat DFC offers you:

- You may connect as many extensions as you want to an application.
- The ability to assign a combination of special keys, so that different appli-
  cations can be connected to the same extension.
- It's very suitable for extracting .ZIP files etc. using a commandline.
- It doesn't use extra memory but merely a few bytes, so you should be able to
  use every program you were able to use before.
- The installation procedure is very easy.

How to install Desktop File Connector (DFC)
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
- Run the DFC_xxx.TOS file, and all files will be extracted. It doesn't matter
  where you placed the .TOS file on your disk, the installation program will
  automatically place it where it belongs.
  Make sure you keep a backup of the original DFC_xxx.TOS file, so that you can
  install DFC later again in case something went wrong.
- Run the INSTALL.PRG program inside the DFC folder (usually you won't need to
  change the options).
- Select the 'Install' button (DFC will now be installed on your boot drive).
- Reset the computer, as soon as the installation program tells you to do so.
- When you're back on the desktop, delete the DFC_xxx folder that was created
  by the DFC_xxx.TOS program. It isn't neccessary anymore, because the DFC fol-
  der was copied onto your bootdrive.

  I didn't make the installation program remove this folder all by itself, be-
  cause if anything had gone wrong, and if you also had deleted the DFC_xxx.TOS
  file from your disk, you wouldn't have DFC anymore!

1.20: (01-05-94) D.B.A. Magazine 10 release
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
- Improved interface, both setup and installation programs.
- 'Check all' option added. This option checks every application in the list for
  it's existence. If an application couldn't be found, you can order DFC to look
  for it elsewhere on the disk or remove it from the list.
  This checking procedure is also performed at start-up.
- Improved manual, Mantra (also a member of Dawn) gave me some second opinions
  and checked the grammar.
- The program's resource files (.RSC) are internal now.
- Improved installation program.
  It's real 'smart' now, the older versions could do some weird things, like
  accidently erase the original DFC folder. I think you can trust it now, I made
  a good protection to prevent such disaster.
- Bug removed from the setup program.
  There were some serious errors in the structure check routines. If you went
  fooling around, things could get messed up. This was due to a fault in the
  move-routine, which moves items to a different place in the list to avoid
  conflicts.
- Bug removed from the setup program.
  If you typed in a few extensions without storing them by clicking on store or
  selecting a different item, and clicked on a button causing the fileselector
  to appear, the typed extensions disappeared in most cases. It's fixed now.

*******************************************************************************
Additive applications/files included with DFC:

TEXTVIEW.TTP - A simple textviewer. Since the desktops' text viewer won't be
               available anymore after installing DFC, you should install this
               text viewer or anything equivalent.
ACC_ACX .TTP - Renames a .ACC file to a .ACX file and vice versa.
               If you change the extensions in the filename (for example:
               INF_INX.GTP) then those extensions are used. Ofcourse you can
               create more of them by copying and renaming it. 
DELETE  .TTP - Deletes the selected file.
MONO_ICN.RSC - A resource file containing a monochrome icon of DFC to put on
               desktop (for computers older than the Falcon: TOS 2.xx/3.xx)
COLR_ICN.RSC - A resource file containing a color icon of DFC to put on your
               desktop (only Falcon or compatible, TOS 4.00 or higher).
