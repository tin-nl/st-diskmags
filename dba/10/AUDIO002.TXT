AUDIO FAQ 2

9.8 Can you build better speakers than you can buy?
 Some people can build better than you can buy.  These people are
 either experts, golden ears, extremely well equipped, inspired, 
 or a combination of the above.

 Some companies have plans available to entice you into buying 
 their drivers: Audio Concepts, Audax, Dynaudio, Focal, KEF, and 
 Scanspeak.  Your success rate with these plans will probably be 
 very good IF your cabinetry skills are very good and IF you 
 follow the plans precisely.  If you deviate (as everyone does), 
 anything is possible.

 Stereophile has published three different plans designed by Dick 
 Olsher which are similar two-way ported systems. A recent one of 
 these was in Stereophile Nov '90, pages 94-127. Audio Magazine 
 published a plan called "The Pitts" by Ken Kantor, in Audio, Nov 
 '88 pages 65-71 continued in Dec '88 pages 73-77.  This plan is 
 a two-way sealed box.

 I have built one published design and one manufacturer's design.  
 I believe that both met my expectations.  They took me a long 
 time to build, taught me a lot, were fun projects, and sounded 
 good when finished.

 I also believe that a commercial system which cost what my parts
 cost will never sound anywhere near as good as the one I build.  
 If you consider $2/hour for my time, however, building is 
 financial suicide.

 Designing your own system is even more a can-of-worms, and 
 should be left to those with either a strong stomach, a very 
 forgiving ear, infinite resources, or excellent guidance.

9.12 How can I improve the sound of my speakers?
 The best way to change the sound of your speakers is to change 
 where you put them.  Ideally, the speakers should be located at 
 ear level, in front of you, squared off between you.  It's then 
 a matter of fiddling with a) the angles, b) the distance apart, 
 c) the distance from you, and d) the distance from the wall.  
 Just moving the speakers around in the room or putting them onto 
 stands can make a major difference. For more on speaker 
 placement, see 13.1 below.

 Other than that, speaker modifications can be a can of worms, or
 can produce very subtle changes, which you might prefer.  For 
 example, you might improve a speaker by adding some cross braces 
 of 1"x1" wood from left to right and from front to back.  This 
 will stiffen the cabinet and reduce speaker cabinet wall 
 vibrations, which probably hurt sound quality.  Alas, this will 
 be most effective with lower-cost and poorly built speakers.

 Along similar lines, some claim success putting lead wire or 
 epoxy putty on thin parts of the speaker to damp out resonances.  
 You can try doing this to the thinner parts of the speaker 
 "basket" or frame, or to the front "baffle" or supporting panel.

 Still another "tweak" is to add sound deadening felt pads to the 
 inside walls of the speaker.  Instead of felt pads some advocate 
 sand-filled latex coatings on the inside walls of speakers.  
 Others advocate ceramic tiles held in place with "thinset". 
 Still others rave about commercial products like AC Glop, 
 Acoustic Magic, and Bostik Sheet.  However, the people who rave 
 about these products tend to be the same people who sell them. 

 Any change along the lines of adding felt, cross-bracing, or 
 putty will have subtle effects on the sound.

 For the brave at heart, you can replace old or cheap drivers 
 with better ones, but the results of this one change can be very 
 dissatisfying if you happen to get the wrong type of driver for 
 that application, and may never sound right, even if you use a 
 similar driver. Speaker system design is still somewhat of a 
 science and somewhat of an art.  Throwing paint on a canvas 
 often makes a mess.

 Whatever change you try, don't "burn your bridge" home.  Be sure 
 that you can undo whatever change you did, just in case.  Many 
 tweaks to good speakers, no matter how well thought through, 
 will correct for one flaw, but create others, or correct a flaw 
 that the designer had cleverly used to his advantage.

9.13 How can I replace/re-cone my old speakers?
 The best chance of success is to buy an identical replacement 
 speaker driver from the manufacturer of the system.

 Second choice is to buy the exact same driver from a 
 distributor.  This is sometimes difficult because it is hard to 
 learn exactly what driver the manufacturer used.  In addition, 
 EVEN IF the manufacturer used stock speakers, they might have 
 used matched pairs or selected speakers by hand for an exact set 
 of specific characteristics.

 There are companies that rebuild drivers, but they charge quite 
 a bit.  I have heard $75 per driver. This is rarely done for 
 anything but very expensive commercial drivers.  Speaker 
 manufacturers will often sell owners the materials that they 
 need to repair a speaker.  If you are handy with delicate 
 things, it is worth a try.

 In addition to speaker manufacturers, there are companies which 
 sells rebuild kits for approximately $30 per pair, containing 
 new foam, a special glue, and instructions.  If you have a blown 
 or distorted voice coil, this still won't help. A few netters 
 have used rebuild kits from this company successfully. Contact:

 Some speaker manufacturers have very good warranties.  
 Electro-Voice warranties all professional products for life.  
 KEF has a similarly broad warranty on their speakers.  Contact 
 the manufacturer first.

9.14 What computer programs can I use to design speakers?
 There are many useful programs available, but none are complete 
 without a good knowledge of speaker design. Further, you will 
 NEED to supplement any program with hand tweaking for the best 
 sound.  Finally, no simulation program is ever useful without 
 good model parameters, and the parameters which manufacturers 
 give you are often imperfect, so many good designers strongly 
 recommend your own lab measurements.  The Loudspeaker Design 
 Cookbook (see 9.9) tells you how to measure a speaker, and also 
 enough theory to feel confident with a good program.

 You can get a lot done with a simple spreadsheet and the 
 equations in a book like The Loudspeaker Design Cookbook.

 For more information on speaker programs for speaker design
 and speaker design hardware, such as measurement systems, get
 the archive "audio.speaker" in directory "dist" on node
 "research.att.com" (also known as 192.20.225.2).

9.15 Can I magnetically shield my speakers for use near a TV?
 You probably will need to buy speakers that are made with an
 integral magnetic shield.  Magnetic shielding is usually done 
 by either shielding the speaker magnet or by cancellation of the
 magnetic field very close to the magnet, or by both.  Shielded
 speakers are NOT built by lining the enclosure with metal.
 While it sounds like a good idea, it doesn't work.  

 A common magnet shield is a mild steel cup around the magnet. 
 This is the cheapest shield, and is usually fairly ineffective. 
 It also will interfere with the speaker's critical magnet gap, 
 so this type of shield can hurt speaker performance by shorting 
 the magnetic field and reducing the magnetic flux density in the 
 gap, which can reduce efficiency and affect the speaker's low
 frequency performance.

 Cancellation is done using a reverse-polarized magnet glued to 
 the back of the main magnet.  If done right, it can almost
 completely cancel the rear stray field.  In some cases it can 
 also increase the magnetic flux density in the gap, which may
 or may not be desirable.

9.17 What are fluid-filled (fluid-cooled, ferro-fluid) tweeters?
 These tweeters are built almost exactly the same as other
 tweeters.  They look and act almost exactly the same, too.
 The only difference is that they have a small, controlled 
 amount of a special fluid inserted into the gap between the
 magnet and the voice coil.

 One big effect of adding this fluid to a tweeter (or to any
 speaker) is that it makes the voice coil capable of dissipating
 more heat.  This means that the speaker can have a lighter voice
 coil, for better performance, or a higher power rating for the 
 same voice coil.  The other big effect of this fluid is to add
 mechanical damping.  The frequency response and transient 
 response of the driver will change, possibly for the better.

 In addition, this fluid may help center the voice coil, may 
 lubricate the voice coil, and may help keep dirt out of the gap.
 This fluid will not increase the magnetic field, concentrate the
 magnetic field or otherwise change the magnetic circuit.  Nor
 will it cushion impact if the voice coil bottoms.

 The fluid used for this purpose is often called "ferrofluid".
 It consists of sub-microscopic particles of magnetic material 
 suspended in special oil.  This fluid stays in the gap because
 of the strong magnetic pull of the magnet.  There is some debate
 over whether these fluids can dry out with time.  Manufacturers
 claim that the oil used is non-volatile.

 It is possible to use ferrofluids in mid-range drivers and
 woofers.  However, as tweeters tend to have the most fragile
 voice coils, tweeters have the most to gain from ferrofluid.
 There are various different fluids on the market, some of which
 have characteristics tailored to tweeters, some to woofers, etc.

 It is very risky to blindly add fluid to a driver.  It may not
 be compatible with the adhesives used in the driver, may not be
 practical with the particular driver layout, and is impossible
 to remove.  Permanent driver damage is possible.

10.0 Amplifiers
 Note: A receiver contains an amplifier, so the following 
 questions apply to both receivers and amplifiers.  In the
 following text, "amp" and "amplifier" are used synonymously.
