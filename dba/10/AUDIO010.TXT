17.2 Which reviews are better?
 Some reviews are so colorful and exciting, that they 
 make great journalism and fun reading.  Lets ignore 
 these for now, even though they have their place.
 
 Beware of reviews from magazines that advertise the same 
 product.  The likelihood of bias is too high. Unfortunately, 
 that rules out 99% of the reviews in magazines.

 Stereo Review has a bad reputation for loving everything 
 made by every advertiser.  Even high-end journals such 
 as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound can be influenced.

 A classic example of misleading reviews occurs with equipment 
 submitted to a magazine for review.  The manufacturer may send 
 the editors a carefully built, adjusted piece for review.  The 
 magazine will honestly rave about it. The manufacturer will then 
 send the design off-shore for more economical manufacture and 
 assembly, and the quality will suffer.  Lower quality components 
 will be substituted for prime parts.  Adjustments will be made 
 to wider tolerances or will not be made at all.  The design may 
 be completely changed to make it more manufacturable.  You will 
 unknowingly get a completely different piece than reviewed.

 Home auditions with one or two candidates from each of a few 
 dealers are your best guide to be sure that you get what you 
 want and pay for.

17.3 Is Consumer Reports right?
 Consumer Reports is the most objective testing lab we have ever 
 found.  Unfortunately, they are also the world's least 
 specialized testing lab.  They market their testing to the 
 average consumer.  The average consumer will not hear some of 
 the subtle differences which audiophiles hear.  For that reason, 
 Consumer Reports ignores issues that others feel vital.

 Consumer Reports also insists on basing their audio testing
 predominantly on lab measurements.  Although lab measurements do 
 tell many differences between devices, interpreting lab 
 measurements for best sound is difficult or impossible.  For 
 example, it is very hard to compare two speaker frequency 
 response curves and tell which will sound better.  Some $3000 
 speaker frequency response curves look worse than some $600 
 speaker curves, even when tested in the same setup.  On the 
 other side of the issue, Consumer Reports has improved its test 
 methods, and will continue to improve.  Expect the accuracy of 
 their reviews to improve with time.

 The Consumer Reports frequency-of-repair data base 
 is larger than any similar data base published and 
 can be trusted as well as any statistic.

18.0 Retail

18.1 Should I use an up-scale retail store?
 This is probably the best place to listen to gear in a 
 controlled environment, next to your home.  This is the best 
 place to find expensive, high quality gear.  This is the place 
 which is most likely to have a good policy on home trials and 
 a liberal return/upgrade policy.  This is also likely to be 
 the most expensive place to shop.  One exception to this is 
 that these stores have the ability to sell demos, returns, 
 and discontinued gear at very advantageous prices.

 Some up-scale dealers will negotiate price on large 
 systems or expensive purchases.  It never hurts to ask.

 There are definitely better and worse local hi-fi stores.  If 
 you find a really good one, it is probably worth the extra money 
 to buy from them, rather than from discounters.  A really good 
 store will not push you to buy what they want to sell.  A really 
 good store will allow you to take your time with your decision.  
 A really good store will not distort the truth in describing 
 equipment.  A really good store will help you get the most out 
 of your purchase by showing you how to set it up.  They will 
 tell you what placement works best for the speakers.  (Don't 
 believe them if they tell you to put them anywhere.)  A really 
 good store also selects their lines carefully.  They don't want 
 dissatisfied customers or warranty returns any more than you do.
 A really good store will also have technical equipment and/or
 skilled technical people that can perform tricky adjustments
 correctly, such as cartridge and tonearm alignment.

 Due to the nature of the customer, a hi-fi store in a shopping 
 mall is likely to use high-pressure sales techniques.  They know 
 that the majority of their customers are distracted easily by 
 299 other stores.  Most of their sales go to customers that 
 come in for 3 minutes, select something, and leave.  There 
 are exceptions to this, of course, but if there was a good 
 generalization, it would be to look elsewhere.  There are stores 
 in large buildings, small buildings, private homes, shopping 
 plazas, and every other conceivable venue.  Search from among 
 these to find one that meets your needs and fits your style.

18.2 Should I use a discount store?
 If you need to listen carefully before making up your mind, 
 discount stores can be very frustrating.  If you know exactly 
 what you want, then this can be a great place to save money.  
 Don't expect knowledgeable sales help or after-sale support.  Be 
 sure to ask about the warranty  (see 19.1 below on warranties).

18.3 Is it right to negotiate price?
 Most people feel that it is fair to negotiate.  Some feel that 
 it is fair to lie in negotiating, as the sales people frequently 
 lie to you also.  Others think that lying to get a lower price 
 is an immoral practice.  It may even be illegal, an act of 
 fraud.  

 Some people feel that if you negotiate over price, you encourage 
 stores to mark prices artificially high, so that the stores have 
 room to negotiate.  Others feel that in negotiating, you are 
 asking the store to accept a lower profit, or asking the sales 
 person to take a lower commission and are directly hurting them.

18.4 How can I negotiate price effectively?
 A great source of information on this topic is available from 
 books on buying a new or used car.  However, some very helpful 
 general tips include:
  Know the competition and the dealer.
  Know the gear.
  Know the prices available elsewhere.
  Believe in your research, not their words.
  Stand your ground.
  Be nice to the people but hard on the deal.
  Be prepared to walk away if they won't agree.
  Expect their lines and prepare responses in advance.  
   For example, expect the dealer to claim that the 
   Nakamichi deck is the best cassette deck on the 
   market.  Be ready with a reply such as at that 
   price, you can buy a DAT machine which has 
   better frequency response, lower signal to noise 
   ratio, etc.

18.5 It sounded great in the store.  Is it great?
 Never let anyone else pick stereo for you.  Especially not 
 speakers.  They all sound different, and you don't need a golden 
 ear to hear the differences.  Listen for yourself and ignore 
 what the sales people say.

 If you are still unsure, ask the sales people to let you take 
 the gear home for a home trial in exchange for a large deposit.  
 Home auditioning takes 99% of the risk out of store auditions.

18.6 Do sales people try to trick the customer?
 Some do and some don't.  Some will treat unpleasant customers 
 badly and treat friendly people well.  Most sales people aren't 
 wealthy.  They sell stereo to make a living.  If they can sell 
 you a more expensive piece of equipment or a piece of equipment 
 with a higher profit, they will make more money.  Usually, this 
 figures into everything they say.  Some sales people claim to be 
 altruistic.

 Some sales people really are open and honest.  They may starve 
 with this approach, or they may have a nice enough personality, 
 a good enough product line, a good enough store behind them, or 
 enough technical background to overcome this "limitation".

18.7 How can sales people trick the customer?
 Often, a customer will trick him or herself without help.  We 
 are often swayed by appearance, sales literature, position of 
 the equipment in the show room, and our own desire to buy what 
 others will like.

 Some times, the sales person will actively try to push a 
 particular piece of equipment by demonstrating it against 
 another piece of equipment which is inferior or defective.

 Some sales people will demonstrate a set of speakers while
 simultaneously driving a subwoofer, even though they are not 
 telling you this.  With the subwoofer, it probably will sound 
 better.

 Some sales people will demonstrate one set of speakers louder 
 than others.  Louder almost always sounds better.

 Most stereo buyers go into the store, spend a few minutes 
 selecting what they want, lay down big bucks, and leave.  They 
 don't need to be tricked.  They don't listen carefully.  They 
 trust the sales person's choice as best in their price range.  
 For non-technical reasons, these people are the most likely to 
 be satisfied with their purchase.

18.8 What should I ask the sales person?
 What do you want to know?  Seriously, the best questions are 
 those which the sales person can answer without distorting the 
 truth.  Don't ask a sales person to compare their brand to a 
 brand they don't sell.  Don't ask "how good is the ...".  Ask 
 questions of fact.

 Here are some questions you may want to ask:
  If I don't like it can I return it for a full refund?
  Can I try this out at my home in exchange for a deposit?
  What does the warranty cover?  For how long?
  What do I need to know to set this up for best sound?
  Do I get a manufacturer's warranty with this?
  Where do I take this to get it repaired under warranty?
  Where do I take this to get it repaired out of warranty?

18.9 How do I impress the sales person?
 Why would you want to?  You have money and he doesn't.

18.10 How do I get the best service from a sales person?
 Be honest with the sales person.  Set some reasonable request 
 and ask them to meet it.  For example, say that you will buy 
 this if you can try it at home first and listen to it 
 side-by-side with a piece from another store.  Alternately, say 
 that you saw the same thing at store Z for $xx less, but you 
 will buy it from the guy if he will match the price.
