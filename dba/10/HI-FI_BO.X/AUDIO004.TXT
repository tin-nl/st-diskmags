10.14 Where can I buy electronic parts to make an amplifier?
 There are many commercial parts distributors that sell only to
 Corporations.  Their prices are often list, their supply is 
 often good, and their service varies.  Common ones are Arrow 
 Electronics, Gerber Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, and Schweber
 Electronics.  See your local phone book.

 There are also distributors that cater to smaller buyers  These
 typically have only one office.  Some have lousy selections but 
 great prices.  In the following list, (+) means that the dealer 
 has a good reputation, (?) means that the dealer has 
 insufficient reputation, and (X) means that some have reported 
 problems with this dealer. (C) means they have a catalog.

10.17 What is Amplifier Class A?  What is Class B?  What is Class AB?
 What is Class C?  What is Class D?

 All of these terms refer to the operating characteristics 
 of the output stages of amplifiers.

 Briefly, Class A amps sound the best, cost the most, and are the 
 least practical. They waste power and return very clean signals.
 Class AB amps dominate the market and rival the best Class A 
 amps in sound quality.  They use less power than Class A, 
 and can be cheaper, smaller, cooler, and lighter.  Class D amps 
 are only used for special applications like bass-guitar amps and 
 subwoofer amps.  They are even smaller than Class AB amps and 
 more efficient, yet are often limited to under 10kHz (less than 
 full-range audio). Class B & Class C amps aren't used in audio.
 
 In the following discussion, we will assume transistor output 
 stages, with one transistor per function.  In some amplifiers, 
 the output devices are tubes.  Most amps use more than one 
 transistor or tube per function in the output stage to increase 
 the power.
 
 Class A refers to an output stage with bias current greater than 
 the maximum output current, so that all output transistors are 
 always conducting current.  The biggest advantage of Class A 
 is that it is most linear, ie: has the lowest distortion.
 
 The biggest disadvantage of Class A is that it is inefficient, 
 ie: it takes a very large Class A amplifier to deliver 50 watts, 
 and that amplifier uses lots of electricity and gets very hot.  
 
 Some high-end amplifiers are Class A, but true Class A only 
 accounts for perhaps 10% of the small high-end market and none 
 of the middle or lower-end market.
 
 Class B amps have output stages which have zero idle bias 
 current.  Typically, a Class B audio amplifier has zero bias 
 current in a very small part of the power cycle, to avoid 
 nonlinearities.  Class B amplifiers have a significant advantage 
 over Class A in efficiency because they use almost no 
 electricity with small signals.  
 
 Class B amplifiers have a major disadvantage: very audible 
 distortion with small signals.  This distortion can be so bad 
 that it is objectionable even with large signals.  This 
 distortion is called crossover distortion, because it occurs at 
 the point when the output stage crosses between sourcing and 
 sinking current.  There are almost no Class B amplifiers on the 
 market today.
 
 Class C amplifiers are similar to Class B in that the output 
 stage has zero idle bias current.  However, Class C amplifiers 
 have a region of zero idle current which is more than 50% of 
 the total supply voltage.  The disadvantages of Class B 
 amplifiers are even more evident in Class C amplifiers, so 
 Class C is likewise not practical for audio amps.
 
 Class A amplifiers often consist of a driven transistor 
 connected from output to positive power supply and a constant 
 current transistor connected from output to negative power 
 supply.  The signal to the driven transistor modulates the 
 output voltage and the output current.  With no input signal, 
 the constant bias current flows directly from the positive 
 supply to the negative supply, resulting in no output current, 
 yet lots of power consumed.
 
 Class B amplifiers consist of a driven transistor connected 
 from output to positive power supply and another driven 
 transistor connected from output to negative power supply.  
 The signal drives one transistor on while the other is off, 
 so in a Class B amp, no power is wasted going from the 
 positive supply straight to the negative supply. 
 
 Class AB amplifiers are almost the same as Class B amplifiers 
 in that they have two driven transistors.  However, Class 
 AB amplifiers differ from Class B amplifiers in that they 
 have a small idle current flowing from positive supply to 
 negative supply even when there is no input signal.  This idle 
 current slightly increases power consumption, but does not 
 increase it anywhere near as much as Class A.  This idle current 
 also corrects almost all of the nonlinearity associated with 
 crossover distortion.  These amplifiers are called Class AB 
 rather than Class A because with large signals, they behave like 
 Class B amplifiers, but with small signals, they behave like 
 Class A amplifiers.  Most amplifiers on the market are Class AB.  
 
 Some good amplifiers today use variations on the above themes.  
 For example, some "Class A" amplifiers have both transistors 
 driven, yet also have both transistors always on.  A specific 
 example of this kind of amplifier is the "Stasis" (TM) amplifier 
 topology promoted by Threshold, and used in a few different 
 high-end amplifiers.  Stasis (TM) amplifiers are indeed 
 Class A, but are not the same as a classic Class A amplifier.
 
 Class D amplifiers use pulse modulation techniques to achieve 
 even higher efficiency than Class B amplifiers.  As Class B 
 amplifiers used linear regulating transistors to modulate output
 current and voltage, they could never be more efficient than 
 50%.  Class D amplifiers use transistors that are either on or 
 off, and almost never in-between, so they waste the least amount 
 of power. 
 
 Obviously, then, Class D amplifiers are more efficient than 
 Class A, Class AB, or Class B.  Some Class D amplifiers have 
 >80% efficiency at full power.  Class D amplifiers can also have 
 low distortion, although not as good as Class AB or Class A.
 
 Class D amplifiers are great for efficiency.  However they are 
 awful for other reasons.  It is essential that any Class D amp 
 be followed by a passive low-pass filter to remove switching 
 noise.  This filter adds phase shift and distortion.  It also
 limits the high frequency performance of the amplifier, such
 that Class D amplifiers rarely have good treble.  The best 
 application today for Class D amplifiers is subwoofers.  
 
 To make a very good full range Class D amplifier, the switching 
 frequency must be well above 40kHz.  Also, the amplifier must be 
 followed by a very good low-pass filter that will remove all of 
 the switching noise without causing power loss, phase-shift, or 
 distortion.  Unfortunately, high switching frequency also means 
 significant switching power dissipation.  It also means that the 
 chances of radiated noise (which might get into a tuner or phono 
 cartridge) is much higher.

10.18 Why do I hear noise when I turn the volume control? Is it bad?
 Almost all volume controls are variable resistors.  This goes
 for rotary controls and slide controls.  Variable resistors 
 consist of a resistive material like carbon in a strip and a
 conductive metal spring wiper which moves across the strip as
 the control is adjusted.  The position of the wiper determines
 the amount of signal coming out of the volume control.

 Volume controls are quiet from the factory, but will get noisier
 as they get older.  This is in part due to wear and in part due
 to dirt or fragments of resistive material on the resistive
 strip.  Volume control noise comes as a scratch when the control
 is turned.  This scratch is rarely serious, and most often just
 an annoyance.  However, as the problem gets worse, the sound of
 your system will degrade.  Also, as the problem gets worse, the
 scratching noise will get louder.  The scratching noise has a
 large high-frequency component, so in the extreme, this noise
 could potentially damage tweeters, although I have never seen
 a documented case of tweeter damage due to control noise.

 Some controls are sealed at the factory, so there is no
 practical way to get inside and clean out the dirt.  Others have
 access through slots or holes in the case.  These open controls
 are more subject to dirt, but also are cleanable.  You can clean
 an open volume control with a VERY QUICK squirt of lubricating
 contact cleaner, such as Radio Shack 64-2315.  Even better is a
 non-lubricating cleaner, such as Radio Shack 64-2322.  With any
 cleaner, less is better.  Too much will wash the lubricant out
 of the bearings and gunk up the resistive element.

 You can also clean some controls by twisting them back and forth
 vigorously ten times.  This technique pushes the dirt out of the
 way, but is often just a short term fix.  This technique is also
 likely to cause more wear if it is done too often.  Try to do it
 with the power applied, but the speaker disconnected, so that 
 there is some signal on the control.

 Sealed and worn controls should be replaced rather than cleaned.
 Critical listeners claim that some controls, such as those made
 by "Alps" and by "Penny and Giles" sound better than common
 controls.  Regardless of the brand, however, it is essential
 that whatever control you buy have the same charcteristics as
 the one you are replacing.  For most volume controls, this
 means that they must have AUDIO TAPER, meaning that they are
 designed as an audio volume control, and will change the level
 by a constant number of dB for each degree of rotation. 

 Badly designed circuits will wear out volume controls very
 quickly.  Specifically, no volume control is able to work for
 a long time if there is significant DC current (or bias current)
 in the wiper.  If the output of the control goes to the input of
 an amplifier, the amplifier should be AC coupled through a
 capacitor.  If there is a capacitor there, it might be leaky,
 causing undesirable DC current through the volume control.

 If you have a circuit with no blocking capacitor or a bad
 blocking capacitor, you can add/replace the capacitor when
 you replace the control.  However, get some expert advise
 before modifying.  If you add a capacitor to a device which
 doesn't have one, you will have to make other modifications
 to insure that the amplifier has a source for its bias current.

11.0 CD Players, CDs, Turntables, and LPs

11.1 What should I listen for when evaluating a turntable or CD player?
 For tape decks and turntables, beware first of speed variations 
 (wow and flutter).  A good check for this is Richard Strauss' 
 "Also Sprach Zarathustra" (aka: The Theme From 2001), which has 
 a long, low, sustained organ note that comes in well before the 
 main theme starts, and is held through the first movement.  
 Concentrate on that.  Make sure it doesn't wobble or warble.  
 There's also a good bit at the beginning of Pink Floyd's 
 "The Wall", but it doesn't go on as long, so you've got less 
 time to think about it.  Tape decks are prone to losing 
 high-frequency notes, so pick something you like which has lots 
 of treble, and make sure it is clear.

 The sound of a turntable is largely bound up in the kind of 
 cartridge mounted on it.  Make sure to listen to a table with 
 a cartridge similar to what you're buying, and not one in a 
 different price bracket.  If possible, audition the turntable 
 with the same arm and cartridge, so that you will experience 
 potential cartridge/arm interactions, too.  Most cartridges 
 work better with one arm than another.  Treat the 
 tonearm/cartridge pair as a system, rather than independent 
 parts.

 For CD players, try some piano music.  See if the high notes 
 sound tinny.  Also, try something which has some soft parts,
 not the same as turning the volume down.  Distortion for CD 
 players (as for other devices) is measured at a high output, 
 but in fact in CD players (unlike others) it's likely to be 
 worse in soft passages of music.  Most classical recordings 
 contain a suitable soft passage.  Most rock music won't.

 Distortion in CD players, if you want to call it that, is 
 a function of the granulation noise, or time-delay pre-echo that 
 can come out of the filtering.  To listen for this, use material 
 that is rich in high-order harmonics, such as brass music.
 Unfortunately, you can't reliably predict how a CD player 
 will sound by looking at specifications, features, or the 
 technology it uses.  If you want to know how a player will 
 sound, you MUST listen to it.
