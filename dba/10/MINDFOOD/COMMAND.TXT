DOS AND NOVELL

--------------------------------------------------------------
            IS THERE MORE BETWEEN DOS AND NOVELL ?
                 -again an article by Slimer-
--------------------------------------------------------------

What's this ??
Well, in this article I'm going to give you a few (useful?)
tips about MS-Dos and some Novell commands.
Many Atari users have a lot to do with PC's at their work and
for those who are a little familiar with both MS-Dos and
Novell I have a few thingies.
Not all these tips are positive but hey I'am a real Atari
freak so you can't expect me to stay fair al the time.

--------------------------------------------------------------

MS-Dos,

* If you want to DELete something you always must type
  Y or N.
  Well how about this command : echo Y | del *.*
  
  Warning please be shure that you use a disk with useless
  data on it, otherwise your screwded !

  Note: the Y can ofcourse also be N and the caracter between
  the Y and del is the caracter above the \ key on your PC    
  keyboard.


* People know that the command DIR will give you a list       
  of everything on a disk.
  But not many know that you can do more with this command. 

Example,

You are for instance in the the subdirectory C:\public\house\junk
and you want to see the main directory C:\ without leaving the
current subdirectory your in, then you can try this,


DIR .... : This command will show the main directory while    
           your still in C:\public\house\junk\msdos

DIR ...  : This command however will let you see for instance
           de directory of C:\public\house and so on.

Just play around with it and it will get clear to you.


Novell,

  If you work on a novell network and you like to know some   
  useful Novell commands then read on,


* If you like to know how many network drives there are 
  available you can use the command : MAP


* When you type USERLIST you get the names of all the people  
  who are logged in on the server.


* Infront of those names are the station numbers which you can use to send
  messages to.
  You can use the following command to send a sentence to another station,

  SEND " ********************** " to XX

  Warning: the station numbers will change everytime when 
  somebody logs in.
  Note: the ***** is the sentence you want to send and the XX
  is the number of the station you want to send the message to.
 

* With the command CASTOFF your computer refuses to accept    
  those message's from other people.
  CASTON will turn recieving back on again.

* The command WHOAMI will give you a roundup of information   
  about yourself.
  When you put /A behind it you will get the complete list.
  

* But if you want to know it all, you just have to type HELP  
  or NFOLIO to the infobase with Novell commands in it.
  Sometimes you have to search for the .NFO files, you just
  have to look in the public directories (simply search
  some different network drives) and you will get a "link"     
  when it is found.
 
* If you read the NFOLIO please study the MAPPINGS and you
  can go places where others can't come.

We of the D.B.A. are not responsible for possible damage
coming from wrong use of these commands.
 
P.S. Beware of remote console watchers like HotLook and others.
     These programmes allow the supervisor to look over your shoulder when
     your working on your PC.
     With Norton Utils you can check for these programmes (look for tiny
     resident programmes).
     By the way, Hotlook isn't able to "look" when your working in Lotus 123.
     Lotus will probably fail to boot when somebody is watching you with
     HotLook or crash (it might be an indication that somebody's looking).
