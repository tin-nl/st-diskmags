DARK

It's dark outside 
What else would you expect at half past nine 
I glance at my screen 
See it's virtually empty 
Put on a hardcore tape 
Smoke a nice dark and light shag tobacco roll 
Still wonder what I wanted 
Let the beat roll down 
Feel like having a beer 
Got myself a beer 
Notice it's low-alcohol 
Put it back and grab a real one 
Smoke a Marlboro 
I'm welcomed to another edition of Thunderdome 
Boot the old ST 
Spend five minutes playing Battle Chess 
Wonder what I am doing 
Reboot and start watching the Froggies 
Decide the picture show makes me puke 
Realise I have to send these articles to Slimer soon 
Put on the television 
See some strange dudes talking politics 
Oh yeah, tomorrow are the elections 
I don't care 
Why elect people who will only annoy you the next four years? 
Fuck off 
There's some silly movie on Germany 
Fuck, why don't I have cable TV? 
Decide to go out walking 
Reboot 
Decide not to go out walking because it's useless 
There's someone slaughtering civilians on the 'Nachrichten' 
He's got a flamethrower 
Probably a napalm bomb coming up next 
I'm at ease 
Living peacefully 
Being rich, like the rest of us 
Why do people make war? 
Because they're poor 
Or at least they think so 
Or they're sadists 
'A Night In Boston' is coming up 
I love it's bassline 
This is all so useless 
But you knew that already 
Why do you read this? 
This text was an attempt to break the world record in letting everyone quit 
this text before they've reached the end. 
If you've read this it didn't succeed. 
The fate of reality is to die one day 
The fate of insanity is never to die 
I'm immortal 
Mentally
