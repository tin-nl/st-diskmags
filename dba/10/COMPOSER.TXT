Introduction:
This article mentions the most famous composers on the CBM 64 and ST
(+ some amiga composers) in more or less ranking or 'chronological'
order, gives examples of their work and states my opinion about them.
Observe that this article is limited: it cannot mention every 64/ST
composer, so I have picked out the ones I find important. (and a few
guys I know!) If I have missed someone obvious then go ahead,
shoot me, or better still: contact me and let me know it.I would love
response to this article: opinions, greetings, addings, support,
dislikings (not too much) etc.

Let's start from the beginning: The '64 composers.

ROB HUBBARD:
The 'main man' and together with Jochen Hippel somewhat of a corner-
stone for this article. (and for music on 64/ST as well...)
He was one of the first to actually discover what the 64 was capable
of. He makes great tunes with excellent instruments, but they can get
a bit repetitive sometimes. (complaining on Rob! Blasphemy!)
Guys on the ST who like the Scavenger (later...) SID tunes
should not be allowed to miss the original 'Warhawk' tune on the 64.
If you like SID sounds you'll love the slow 'intro' of the song.
(if you don't it'll sound like a cat being torn to pieces..)
He have done so many good tunes so it is hard to pick out any specific
but lets mention some of them: The tune you hear when playing 'Delta'
is a weird, but pretty cool tunes which seems to last forever. I am
also fond of the tune in 'Mega apocalypse'. It is jam-packed with
action. 'One man and his droid' and 'Phantoms of the asteroids' are
two tunes I had in the loader on some 64 game which have stuck in my
memory. (Both, plus an OK version of Warhawk is available in the
prehistoric 'BIG demo'). On the ST 'Human race 4' featured in 'Gold-
runner' and the tune in 'Thrust' shouldn't be missed. I better stop
here, or I will mention every tune Rob ever made! If he just had
worked more on the ST! I wonder what he does now?

DAVID WHITTAKER:
I mention him here under Rob because he is so big in terms of quantity
but frankly I am not especially fond of him.He's a bit boring somehow.
(no offence David) On the ST you can always listen to the chipversion
of the Xenon 2 song 'megablast',or off course the original Xenon tune.
'Beyond the ice palace' is a bit different tune which I must mention,
it has a moody atmosphere which makes the game better. Probably there
are some guys out there which will kill me for making this part so
small, but as I said: I don't really like him.

MARTIN GALWAY:
Another SID sound specialist. I suppose most of you guys have played
'Rambo II' and 'Green Beret' on the 64, and therefore have a clue of
who he is. He seems to be a fan of the 64 specific 'sawtooth' (cat-
killer...) sound which you either love or hate... I like him!
Sadly he hasn't done anything on the ST. (As far as i know...)

BENN DAGLISH:
Another well talented musician that sometimes seems to lack good
instruments... On ST you could play 'Switchblade', or the old game
'Deflektor' to hear his capabilities. On the 64 I remember songs
from games like 'Venom strikes back', 'North star'+ many others.

JAS BROOKE:
An unpredictale guy. The song in the ST version of 'Thunderstrike'
makes me sick, but another game from the same company (Millenium)
called 'Resolution 101' is a bit different. It got a nice, 'swingy'
style. On the 64 you must listen to the 'Krackout professional' tune
A jolly, chirpy tune with fun instruments.

JEROEM TEL:
A great musician from which I have heard extremly little. His tune in
the game 'Cybernoid' on the 64 is great. Good tense feelimg, good
instruments. The famous Union demo has a conversion of it. Also check
out 'Supremacy' (on ST).

UBIK:
I just have to mention the tune in'Arcade classics' released by Fire-
bird on the 64. It contains electric guitars and basses(!) together
with nice drumsound and a good powerful tune. Thrust II also have a
weird song by him. (He is also the programmer of both games)

MANIACS OF NOISE:
Another well known group on 64, which musn't be forgotten. Some Mad
Max tunes are conversion of MON tunes.Listen to Syncs tracker version
of one of the tunes, called 'Future composer'. Some tunes in the
before mentioned, legendary Union demo is also originally MON tunes.

Well, so much for the 64 bit. Now let us continue with the ST
specialists. Most of the before mentioned composers have made music
on ST as you might have seen, but it seems illogical to mention them
again so this part is almost solely based on pure ST composers.

MAD MAX (or JOCHEN HIPPEL):
Placed first for logical reasons... He is a good songconverter with
many titles behind him, but also talented on his own. Games like
Wings of Death and Lethal Xcess plus many, many (many, many, many!)
others proves that. As good as all his songs is of good quality with
good 'flow' and nice instruments. I suppose I don't have to give
examples of where you can hear his tunes as they are everywhere!
Mad Max must be one of the most famous guys on the ST, it is almost
unnecessary to include him in this article...

COUNT ZERO:
Also a well known and talented musician, fond of (great) drums and
some 'odd' (but cool) instruments. Check out his musicmixer in the
Decade demo! His tunes are tense, have good 'feeling' and rhythm
together with powerful drums. Some of his quartet tunes are a bit
boring though with dull instruments. (the tune in 'Things not to do'
is OK though)

SCAVENGER:
Another great guy who have managed to introduce SID-sound to the ST!
But his tunes without SID sound, like the one in Electras part in
PYM is great too! He seems to be fond of quick, fast changing 'solo-
like' parts (like in the afore-mentioned tune). The tune in the intro
of DBA 6 is a great tune which uses the 'fake' SID sound to the full.
I definitely rank this guy high!!

BIG ALEC:
He is good, it is funny that I hadn't heard of him before PYM. He is
very fond of the buzztone, but you get used to it. If I'm not wrong
he has done the music to 'No second prize' and that is some music!
Cool bass, cool sound, cool everything! The in game music seems
blues inspired, and the intro tune is loosely based on (the beginning)
the original Thalion intro song. Most PYM songs is great too!

TAO:
He is also often using the buzztone sound, and is good at it. Some of
his tunes can be a bit boring, but for example the song in the main-
menu of 'Just buggin' is good. And his 'Sleepwalker' conversion is
excellent.

JESS or Ninja turtle:
A strange guy. 90 percent of his songs is pretty boring, chaotic,
somehow lacking an ordinary tempo and 'logic', but some of them are
brilliant! The tune in Legacy's part of 'Froggies over the Fence'
(Middle earth theme) is superb with great tempo and rhytm and the
song in 'My socks are atomic flame throwers' (for your loader #1) in
'Choice of gods' Is also fantastic, albeit a tad short. Don't miss
'Ze 16 minutes Hit' in the resetpart with some cool bass in the
last half of the song.

LAP:
A guy I almost forgot! (and that would have been a mistake) He is
cool with 'different' instruments, and in 'Coast- Cray 2 emulator'
(in PYM) you can hear one of his most known songs. The tempo-changing
is impressive.

EXCELLENCE IN ART:
He makes songs of good quality, but they can get a bit repetitive,
maybe they would sound better with real human song in them. His
'Get into the groove' conversion is good. His bassline sounds can
get boring pretty fast in some other tunes though. Big Alec, for
example do also often use buzztone sounds, but dont become boring as
easily.

Trackerdudes:

WALKMAN:
A norwegian guy working only in trackers. Anyone who have missed
'Songs of the unexpected' (STE only) should need a brain-
repair! His tunes are mostly soft with pianos etc. but 'Klisje paa
klisje' also have some great bass-sounds etc. One of my favourites!
He may be compared  to Tip on the Amiga perhaps...

GLADIATOR:
Also represented on 'Songs of ...' with some great tunes. 'Please
listen' and 'Hurricane' are two of the best ones. Somehow I grade him
lower than Walkman, but that's only my opinion...

JUAN (7an):
An ST dude working in Audio Sculpture. His music is nice with good
samples and so on,but traces of 'repetitivism' can be found here too.
Listen to 'Latem giseo' for a wild electric guitar mix.
He has a peculiar habit: He almost never use the same pattern twice,
not even if the tune partly repeats itself!

BLUE NUN:
He may not be too famous (yet), but he is great anyhow. 'Monstrin' in
the recently released 'Trackmania II' is great, with some excellent
drumpattern. Also check out his older 'Italian Backdraft'.

TERRY:
Good Swede! Technofreak, and maybe too much of it! OK, he has done
some soft tunes too, like 'Friendship' in Trackmania II or 'News'
in Trackmania I, but Techno rules. Some technotunes can get a bit
repetitive, like 'Hangover' in Trackmania I, a tune which starts OK
but whose middlepart is repeated into boredom..
According to Lord in CAC, Terry has stopped making tunes and will
concentrate on a technoband instead.

And now as a little parenthes I will mention some (random) AMIGA(rgh)
composers:

TIP:
In my opinion one of the best Amiga composers. Noone on ST should miss
HIFI-dreams by Aura. The best with some of his tunes are that they
sound like I want! Take 'The sweat shop' for example: First there is
some choirlike instruments, soft and a bit sad. 'A little pianoplink
would suit perfect just here', I thought for myself. And voila, there
it was, exactly as I wanted it. The first time I heard 'Chinese Dream'
I almost reached a orgasmic state, because everything just 'sat' where
it should!

HALLON SOFT:
Maniacs. Some guys say that all their peculiar instruments etc. corru-
pts their song, but other claim that they make the song better. I'm
not sure... Check out their latest (and last?) music disk.

JESPERKYD:
A guy of variying quality..His tunes in 'Global Trash' are marvellous!
Great instruments. But, for example his tune 'Hallucinations' quickly
gets repetitive.

BIORKMAN:
Hello Thomas, you Amigafreak! Hope you like being mentioned!! (he
happens to be in the same class as I, and therefore (and because his
(techno)tunes are nice!) I must mention him here...)


Well, let's stop here. I feel more or less satisfied now, but I must
say that I think there are some ST trackerdudes missing, and I must
remind you that the Amiga part doesn't strive to be complete, it is
just a little parenthes.
Remember that I would love some response to the article. Maybe even
some real musicians can 'fill in' this article a bit?
