Ok, this article is about to give you hints, tips and startegic
advice on how to get rid of every robot in Paradroid. I will off-
course mention my favourite droid, and at the end I will reveal the
fruits of my frenetical and stubborn efforts: my hiscore!

Andrew Braybrook, famous for titles such as Uridium (on the 64),
Simulcra, Fire n' ice plus others,really outdid himself when he
created this ace game. The original 64 version (which I sadly haven't
played...) was a success, so  a 16-bit conversion was born. The game
contains a great mix of pure action and strategy together with a
tense feeling of 'who is there?', nice graphics and excellent
programming, making it awesome if you're up to the challenge.
Here we have the main problem with the game: It is damn hard, espe-
cially in the beginning, putting people off before they really have
started. This is where this article enters the scenario.

First of all you should deselect the transfer-game, especially if
you're a beginner. Actually I never play with the transfergame on
(I'm too much of a lazy coward)and some Paradroidfreaks probably
don't like that.(I don't care) Remember that my tips always assumes
that you have deselected transfer-game!

Here comes a list on how to kill/transfer any droid, and to use them
to your advantage.

101-Influence device
Your standard droid. Its weapon is headmounted, so you can quickly
shoot in every direction you want. It got lousy armour and slow/weak
shots, so change to at least a 302-Messenger quickly. Remeber:If the
ID dies,then it's over!

123-Cleaner, 296-Servant
Harmless (unarmed). Don't transfer to, unless you have to.

302-Messenger
The best choice of the unarmed. Quick moving and quick accelerating.
if using it make sure you keep on moving.

476-Maintenance
To fight it: Keep a range becoz its flamethrower won't reach far.
Only transfer to it if you're any of the droids above, or you are way
down in power. It is pretty slow-turning, but got an OK topspeed.
To control it: Fairly straightforward. Remember that it hasn't a
headmounted weapon, but you can't see which way you're aiming.
Transfer to another droid quickly.

614-Sentinel (Probably my favourite droid)
To fight: This robot is often guarding important places on the later
ships. It is then totally unmobile (but is quick when not on sentinel
duty/but can still be transferred to) and shoots at you on sight. If
you got a low-grade droid this Sentinel can be tough to get rid of.
Its machinegun has quick muzzle speed and high firerate, but the
shots are weak so when using, for example the 734-Battledroid the
shots won't do any harm at all. Somehow I usually transfers to this
droid, maybe just becoz I'm so fucking fond of it. Watch out on open
spaces and near some elvators, and make sure that when you hear the
machinegunnoise, you get the hell out of there fast!!!.Run around a
corner,start the transfer beam, wait a little while (if it was far
away when it shot at you) and then turn around the corner again with
full speed to transfer to it. If you must transfer to it on an open
space then run around it in an anticlockwise decreasing circle.
To use: As I said this robot is quick moving and shooting so it is
perfect for my fighting method: Shoot a few bullets, run around a
corner, turn around,shoot a few more bullets etc. Be paranoid when
using it; shoot a bullet every time you round a corner to make sure
you're not stumbling onto anything. When meeting heavy armoured
enemies then transfer to them with high speed.

683-Sentinel
To fight: This one can be dangerous to meet if youre the ID for
example.It has a weapon that looks like a gascloud, destroying low-
armoured robots in no-time. It has bad eyes and is slow moving/
turning and the weapon is weak though. Attack on long range from
behind.
To use: I almost never use this droid. It is to slow for me, but if
you have it you must attack on close range, hopefully from behind.
Always be prepared to transfer to a new droid. This robot is
disastrous to your hit rate.You'll waste several shots just to start
the transfer beam.

729-Battle
To fight: This tank is peculiar. Although it only has visual capa-
bilities it only shoots at you if you're making any noise, so if
using a droid with a low-powered weapon it might be wiser to sneak
past it and trade to another droid before you try to kill it. It
shoots in 3-shots intervals.
To use:This robot can only move up or down, so you can't transfer to
this droid.

742-Battle
To fight: This one is easier to fight than you think, becoz of its
slow weapon. So if you are a small and quick droid it is easy
transferred to. This robot can only shoot in eight directions making
it easier to avoid its shots. It moves slowly, but can turn around on
a penny!
To use:Try to be defensive so you won't end up in a head-on firefight.
The triple laser is to slow for that,so it might end up with the enemy
shooting your shots AND managing to fill you with lead.

783-Battle
This is a 683 sentinel with the same flamethrower as the 476 droid.
Use about the same tactics as when using the 683,but remeber that the
flamethrower is more powerful, but slower.

734-Battle
To fight:This robot tries to lay mines in your path,but they are
pretty easy avoided. The problem is to kill a 734. They have fabulous
armour, only the 999-command beats it. Therefore I usually transfers
to it, as it is fairly easy to come close to becoz its lack of speed,
but usually I 'trade' it for another droid later.
To use: To actually plan ahead and lay mines in other droids way is
awkward so i usually try to ram my enemies to death.(very useful on
the 729 droid!) The 734 is slow, but can stand so much damage that
you don't have to care when trying to transfer to other droids,making
it a good platform for transferring.

852-Security (another fun droid)
To fight: Transfer to the sucker fast, unless you have the 821 or
the 999. Its weapon damages every droid on screen, and the droid
is pretty quick moving, so be fast! It has a good armour.
To use:Great fun! Of some reason you must see the robot you are
shooting at, but otherwise you shouldn't have much problems. Raiders,
821:s and 999:s is unaffected of the disruptor. When eventually
trying to transfer to another droid, try not to damage it first!!!

821-Security (a great droid)
To fight: Pure hell usually!This robot is one of the few that moves
and shoots simultaneously. It has a headmounted weapon that makes it
possible for it to shoot at you when fleeing. I usually transfers to
this robot. To transfer to this one isn't easy, you usually must flee
from it to make it chase you,and suddenly make a quick turn-around at
the spot with the transferbeam on to take it. Try to lure it round
corners (like on the 614)
To use: Try to make use of the headmounted electrobolt.It is extremly
powerful and useful (even if you can't use the weapon as good as the
computer). This robot is very fast but can be nervous to use at close
quarters. Its shield is excellent.

xxx-Raider
To fight: If having a low-class droid, try to avoid it and transfer
to something bigger. They remind of the 614-Sentinel, but with triple
shots. They have weaker armour though. If using a 'heavy' droid, blow
him to pieces. His shots won't hardly affect you.
To use: He is a humanoid, so you can't control him.

999-Command
To fight: Transfer to him, or die! Well,with the 821 you might have a
chance to fight it if you have to, but I wouldn't recommend it. The
999 is rather easy to transfer to as long as you are quick and
decesive, but beware of the extremly powerful shots. It is fast too!
To use: It is fast, it has the perfect armour, so what more can you
need? The answer is simple: A weapon that doesn't have to recharge
when shooting, and longer lifetime! The robot burns out itself in
no-time! Usually you don't have to care about enemyshots as the
powermeter decreases in almost the same speed as enemydamage! The
shots take too long to use, making the droid more unuseful than you
think. It is not the ultimate killing machine, but the perfect plat-
form to transfer to other droids, and to use for a while.

Now to some major hints and tips:

Always transfer to new, fresh robots. This fills the ID:s power, and
resets the 'inner' powermeter. Don't harm robots that you're gonna
transfer to.

Remember that enemyrobots usually stands still when shooting, while
yourself usually must move against your target. Try to use this to
your advantage.

Watch out for explosions, unless being the 614-sentinel or higher.
(the 614 can be damaged by explosions, but usually no critical
injuries)

Learn the sounds from the various weapons, like the machinegun from
the 614-Sentinel for example as it is hard to see the shots.

As far as I know, any robot controlled by you can survive at least
one shot from any enemy (if having full power). Keep that in mind
when trying to transfer. (I am not sure about the combinations
123-Cleaner and 999-command, or 123-Cleaner and 852-Security though..)

Study the layout of the ship,and note where the bridge is.Usually the
bridge has the most powerful droids, normally including one
999-Command. Beware!

Beware of the flames from the Spaceships onboard, and experiment with
them yourself! (just touch the cockpit-panel to activate the engines)

Remember that elevators may reach different floors, depending on
right or left position on screen.

Look for small (5x5?) keys lying on the floors on most ships. They
give 5000 bonuspoints when completing a ship. (usually one per ship)

For high scores try to keep the hitrate and killrate up.

Off course try to memorize how the droids look, so you know what to
expect from them.

Enemydroids can only look forward,but yourself can also see behind
yourself, as long as there are no walls blocking the vision.Attack
droids from behind.

Look and listen to the doors on the deck. You can see them opening
even if you can't see the droid itself.(same thing with the energizer)

Watch out for 'dead' robots rushing around and shooting after you have
killed them. They self-destruct after a while, but if it gets to
dangerous one shot should stop it.

Memorize the positions of the transmat-points to make a clear and
quick getaway when having completed a ship.

Shooting the background-blocks gives you some points,if you haven't
anything more important to do...

Release the button after every shot you fire when standing still so
you wont start the transferbeam instead!

Try to clear the decks in some kind of logical order so you wont have
to run through empty decks all the time. This can be disatrous if
using a powerful droid as it will burn out before you reach new
droids, and that means back to the ID again.

Just a curiosity, but you can see the alarm status on the 742:s eyes,
and on the 683 and 783:s back, just behind the head.

Be patient,even if it can feel a bit impossible to get anywhere when
you are a rookie. One life is little, but sufficient! Practice!!!!!

Now here comes the exciting bit. Paradroid fans peer down at their
jotted down hiscores,curious and excited."Is he good enough to write
this article?","Am I better??" The questions varies... Here is the
answer: Under a long session of playing I managed to complete all
ships in a row (with transfer-game deselected) without dying, making
up a score of: 241885. This score is not unbeatable in any way, but I
don't think you can better it too much though...
