shock

shock to the thoughts and to the mind

[--She laid on the chest, tired, and she fell asleep*
[--By accident, I woke her up, and she smiled*
[--She told me about God and purpose
[--And all I did was smile--]

smile

smile to each other

[--I battled from an Atheist coat of armor*
[--And she grinned and argued back*
[--We both giggled*
[--She listen to what I said, then I heard her*
[--And she fell back asleep--]

peace
