NEWS ROUNDUP

Phew, I compiled all the scattered info from Internet, Compuserve, CES
and a few magazines (Especially The Edge! UK magazine). And here's the
deal. Seems we have a nice selection of developers and titles going.
Mortal Kombat -WILL- be done, but not by Acclaim. Enjoy!

Some quotes from the Edge:

- "With the arrival of Jaguar, we're promised one cartridge for the world.
   this can only be a stel in the rights direction"

- "Every major UK softw. house is developing for Jaguar- in some case 3 or
   4 titles" -Darryl Still, market. man. Atari UK.

- "The PAL version-unlike the bodged machines offered by S*ga and N*ntendo-
   offers a fullscreen display and no discernable difference in operating
   speed"


The Edge also has an interview with both Attention To detail (Cybermorph)
and Rebellion (AvP, Checkered Flag II). Some interesting quotes:

ATD:

- Cybermorph is moving between 400 and 600 polygons a frame at 10 to 18
  frames/sec. It handles around 6000 polygons/sec.
- Atari are already consulting us about what we would like in Jaguar 2.
  (then the already famous 40/60 Mhz and graphics quote is mentioned)
- The 68000 can be run in parallel with Tom & Jerry, so in Cybermorph we have
  it moving all the objects in the world.
- What is does give you is a future proof machine: three, four years down the
  line we'll have Jaguar 2, but it'll still be running old software.

Rebellion:

- I'd say that speedwise, in 256 colours, a 486DX2-66Mhz will just about match
  the performance of the Jaguar. But then the Jaguar will probably be able to
  offer the same speed in 16 or 24 bit color....
- Aliens vs Predator runs in 16 bit color mode (65k)
- in AvP we've managed to get the game compressed at a ratio of just under 7:1
  without any loss in quality. That effectively gives us around 14 Megabytes
  (112 Megabits) of space on a two megabyte (16 Megabit) cartridge.

                                *************
....And now on with the titles/developers. Let's make that FAQ grow, Robert!
