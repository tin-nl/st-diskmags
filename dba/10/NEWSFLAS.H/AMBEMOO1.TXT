    HEY AND WELCOME, HERE IS JADE (EX.SHADOWMASTER) TO TELL
          YOU SOME IMPORTANT STUFF. I WAS ON THE WORLD OF  
      COMMODORE IN COLOGNE. I, SETHOS AND TITAN HAVE SPOKEN
     WITH ERIK SIMON (EX. ES/TEX). WE HAD READ THE TEXT ON THE 
   AMBERMOON PACKAGE. ON THE PACKAGE WAS WRITTEN THIS TEXT.
     ATARI ST AND FALCON HAS 16 COLORS, BUT THE GAME CONTAINS
                    SPECIAL BITMAP ROUTINES FOR DA FALCON.
   OK, OK , OK.... BUT WE SAY , " WHY 16 COLORS FOR DA FALCON V. " ,
  ERIK SIMONS ANSWER , " THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH FALCONS SOLD
   IN GERMANY. AND IT IS TO EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE THE FALCON V.

          BUT THERE IS ONE HOPE. WHEN THALION GETS A LOT OF 
        RESERVATION FOR A FALCON VERSION. THERE WILL PRODUCE
      AMBERMOON FALCON. OKAY GUYS IN THE SCENE AROUND THE
          WORLD. GET IN CONTACT WITH ME OR SETHOS. WE WILL  
      COLLECT THE RESERVATIONS AND WILL SEND THEM TO THALION.

                 OKAY GUYS, AMBERMOON IS THE ONLY AND BEST    
    FANTASY-ADVENTURE YOU CAN GET ON AN ATARI. AND I NOW WHAT I
    SAY, I HAVE BOUGHT WITH A FRIEND AMBERMOON FOR THE AMIGA 1200...
      AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH DIS GAME. PLEASE GUYS SAVE 
                        YOUR MONEY FOR AMBERMOON.
