                           25/05/1994

1 - What driver should I use with my Atari system ?

There are several drivers available :

MetaDos :
     Free software from Atari Corp.
     Available from atari.archive.umich or ftp.muenster.de (metads23.zip)

     The filesystem drivers support ISO9660 and High Sierra CDs, but not
     multisession CDs.
     The device driver only works for the Atari CDAR504 connected to the
     ACSI bus or with generic SCSI CD-ROMs connected to the TT SCSI port.
     (Answer from Julian Reschke)


CDROM.XFS :
     Free software (Copyright 1992,1993,1994 Eric R. Smith, Michael Bernards
     u. Gunther Leis)
     Available from atari.archive.umich and other ftp sites.

     This driver is a Mint extended filesystem and works on TTs and Falcons.
     CDROM.XFS version <0.7 does not work with Mint/Multitos > 1.04.
     The curren version (0.7) is said to work on Mint/Multitos > 1.04.
     It seems to be true on TTs but it does not work with any Mint version
     on my Falcon.


CD-Tools :
     Commercial solution from Hard & Soft, Obere Muensterstrasse 33-35,
     D-44575 Castrop-Rauxel, Germany, Phone: ++49 2305 18014, Fax: ++49 2305
     32463

     Includes MetaDOS with GEM-based installation program, audio player with
     PCM audio data import (only some drives) and custom devices and
     filesystem drivers (support for Atari CDAR504 and generic CD-ROMs
     connected to ACSI through host adapter, TT-SCSI, Falcon-SCSI,
     multisession support (only some drives)).
     (Answer from Julian Reschke)

     With CD-Tools, you also have a GDPS module and the program Scan-It that
     can handle Photo-CD Pictures.
     CD-Tools is in German and costs 99 DM.


ExtenDOS v1.11:
     Commercial solution from Anodyne Software, 6 Cobbler Court, Ottawa,
     Ontario K1V 0B8, Canada.
     Available in UK : System Solutions.

     Support ST, STe, Mega, TT, and Falcon. Read ISO9660  and High_Sierra
     CD-ROMs. It now runs just fine under MultiTOS with no restrictions;
     memory protect is OK, and you can run programs directly from CD. It
     also runs fine with Mag!X 2.01, with the restriction that the
     EXTENDOS.CNF file must be in the root directory.

     Extendos v1.11 costs $29.95(North America).

F030_CD :
     Fairware from Peter Hilbring, Dietrich Otmar Straûe 16, 59597
     Erwitte, Germany
     Available on ftp.tu-clausthal.de
     (/pub/atari/falcon/systools/f030_cd.zip)
     
     This package includes a BOS driver for MetaDOS, MetaDOS 2.3, a
     low level SCSI driver (TT & FALCON) and a program named
     cd_explorer as exemple of the access of the low level driver.
     
     I've just tried these drivers on my falcon with an Apple
     CD-300 cdrom and it works without problem.
     (Info from Vincent Lefevre)
     

ICD Pro :
     Old versions came with a MetaDOS driver named ICDCDROM.BOS.
     The new ones comes with a mint extended filesystem.



2 - What discs are available ?

There is three Atari specific CD-ROMs :

rn the PC programs but you will access all the text, pictures, and sound
files on it.
The discs already tried are :

Corel Artshow 91 :
     1000 scans of paintings (like Manet, Van Gogh, ...) in 16 and 256
     colors PCX files;
     All the images from the 91 Corel draw contest in CDR and DIB format;
     some midi files.
     The PCX and DIB files can be read with Dieter Fiebelkorn's Gem-View
     3.xx .

3 - Can I use Photo-CD on my Atari ?

Of course You can !
To have full use of the photo-cds, you'll need a multi-sessions drive and
driver and also a program that can handle PCD files.

CD-TOOLS :
     The driver from Hard & Soft can read multi-sessions discs and have all
     the needed stuff to handle the Photo-CDs.

ColorDisc PCD :
     Commercial software from Color Concept, Im Alten Breidt 4, D-53797
     Lohmar Breidt, Germany, Phone: (02246) 7132

     This program allows you to manipulate the photos on your Photo-CDs, and
     save them on hard-disc. It handles Portfolio CDs.
     If my understanding is good, it works with metados and a special BOS
     file (both included).
     It also includes a CD-Audio player.

     A demo version is available at ftp.tu-clausthal.de.
     ColorDisc PCD works on TTs and Falcons and costs 99 DM.

Studio Photo :
     Commercial software from Eurosoft.
     This french program can manipulate Photo-CDs.

Gemview v3.xx :
     Shareware from Dieter Fiebelkorn, GrÅner Weg  29a, W4370 Marl-Brassert,
     Germany,Email : fiebelko@bonny.informatik.uni-dortmund.de

     Gemview is also capable of handling PhotoCD's. Only in two resolutions
     (Base and Base/4 I think)

4 - Can I play Audio-CDs on my Atari ?

Of course You can !

The following programs are available :

CD-TOOLS :
     The driver from Hard & Soft includes a player for CD-Audio discs. The
     drive must understand SCSI2 instructions(Or CDAR504 or the Apple
      CD150).


ColorDisc PCD :
     It also includes an audio Player.

Audio CD Master 3.0 :
     Commercial software from It's All Relative Software, 2233 Keeven Lane,
     Florissant, MO 63031, USA.

     This program can play CD-Audio discs on SCSI2 and Nec drives. On
     falcon and with some drives, it allows you to control and pipe your CD
     audio sound into the Falcon for DSP effects using software like the
     Audio Fun Machine that comes with your Falcon 030.

     Audio CD Master 3.0 costs $29.99 US, postpaid, worldwide.

Audio CD player 2.0 :
     Older shareware version of Audio CD Master 3.0 from Nina Montaser, P.O.
     Box 52127, Ottawa, Ont. K1N 5S0, Canada

     Does not work on my falcon


5 - Appendix A

These are some users configurations :

TT, MultiTOS 1.04, CDROM.XFS
TT, MultiTOS 1.08/9, CDROM.XFS v.0.7
TT, MetaDOS

These do not work:

TT, MultiTOS 1.08/9, CDROM.XFS < 0.7
TT, MultiTOS, MetaDOS

Drive : NEC Multispin, external (84-1).

Discs :   GEMini Atari CD ROM from Walnut Creek
               Clipart Warehouse

------------------------------------------------------------------
MSTE -> ICD MicroSCSI -> ICD AdSCSI+ -> NEC CDR-37
but the first host adapter in the chain has nothing to do with driving the
CD-ROM, its for a hard disk. The AdSCSI+ also has a hard disk running from
it as well as the CD-ROM

Drive : NEC CDR-37

Software :

ICDCDZ2.XFS as supplied on the ICD Pro utilities disk. This only seems to
work under MiNT <= 1.04. None of the other freely available CD-ROM drivers
(MetaDOS etc.) seem to work. I haven't tried Extendos or CD-Tools.

For audio playing, I'm using Nima Montasser's 'Audio CD Master 3v0'. This
is the commercial release of the AUD_CD20.ACC audio CD player. Both work
fairly well for me, but I haven't got all the features to work yet.

In order to CD Player configuration to work (the default NEC CDR-37 one
didn't work! with AUD_CD20.ACC ) I contacted NEC(UK). They very kindly
sent me a copy of their 'SCSI 1 Spec' free of charge. This is a 90 page
photocopied document which lists all the SCSI 1 commands for a CD-ROM and
what they do. I'm sure its pretty out of dte now, especially as NEC must
be onto SCSI 2 by now.
I used the SCSI.PRG from the ICD Pro disk to send SCSI commands to the
CD-ROM to get the combination right.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Atari Falcon030, 4MB RAM, 127MB Internal IDE drive, 270MB external
SCSI drive, Viper 105S Tape Streamer.

Drive : NEC 2xi

Non-working drivers: MetaDOS 2.3 (no BOS drivers for Falcon).
               ICD Pro Utilities (didn't see the drive at all).
               Atari CDROM driver, v0.6 (gave read errors).

Working drivers :  ExtenDOS v1.11  (commercial, available in the UK from
                    Systems Solutions, price about 30 pounds).

Discs : Gemini Atari CD-ROM.
Cover disk from a PC CD-ROM magazine.  The files read OK, but obviously
the PC-specific executables do not run.  I got loads of TIF pictures etc
off of this disk.
The NEC 2xi is about the same price as an Apple CD300 (160 pounds + VAT).
But people seem to have had less hassle getting the Apple drive running.
I chose the NEC because is an internal drive, so slotted into my
mini-tower comfortably.


Thanks to all the users that mailed me their experience sofar.

If you have usefull info about your/other CD ROM disks/ players/ drivers/ 
utils send them to the DBA HQ for our next issue. Let's all try to make
CD ROM work on Falcon in the future !!!!!!
