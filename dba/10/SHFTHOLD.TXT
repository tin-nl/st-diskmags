SHIFT HOLD

Programmed by: Goof and Fox  of the Giants


This is a little util for lazy people, or just for people who find it hard
to keep the SHIFT pressed while moving to the next key.
It was originally writen for disabled people, but it was so handy I use it 
myself right now.

You can put it in the AUTO folder or start it from the desktop.
If you want to type a shifted key or a capital you press SHIFT, release it
and next press the button to be shifted.
Holding the shift-key is also no problem, it will work as always.

There are some limitations:
It won't work on demo's and a lot of games.
It also won't work with Tempus, Turbo assembler and other programs
who have their own keyboard interupt.

Do you have any comment or ideas for this little util?
