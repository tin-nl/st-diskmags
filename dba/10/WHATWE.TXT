What We Say
by J. Guenther

*Something wrong*
(I hear it;
It's like a low hum or soft purr)
[And I can hear it in the world]

*Convert to GIF--
Override the interlace header and read the PCX
Crank the MODs*
(Lightspeed C through CyberSpace)
[Overtake Pascal by leapbounds and 
be sure to document it]

*There's something still wrong*
(Potential turns to kinetic energy)
[Centripetal force dances around the radius
while we examine the slope of the tangent]

([We sometimes get caught up with our words...])
*Just listen to the spin doctors...*

[We know what we say and we know what we mean]
(But does that mean)
[(*that you know what we mean, too?*)]
