JC TENNIS FOR LYNX

LYNX Review


Jimmy Connors' Tennis


A verry happy hi! to you all.

This is a Lynx review made by Crap DC of the Atari Boys.
I am writing this review because I think that the LYNX is being 
dumbed in the land of the unknown machines.

So, here we go.

~JCONNORS.BL2               ~
        





By Hand Made Software.

When you turn your Lynx on and the 1st title pic is gone, there 
appears a nice digitized picture of Jimmy Connors, some rolling 
balls with the credits on them and some sort of demo of 
different matches with some nice music playing.

You want to play the game so, you press "A" to continue.
Now Jimmy says:"HI! I'M JIMMY CONNORS. WELCOME TO THE BELLA 
COUNTRY CLUB."

An option screen appears.
Here you can choose between male and female, singles and doubles, 
grass and hard, level 1-4(I dont know the difference) and you can 
enter your initials.
There's also a restore function with difficult codes.

Go to "ALL OK" if you want to start the game.
There appears a tournament ladder, you can play against other 
players 4 places higher on the ladder than you.
                                                ~RACKET.BL2~

"LET'S PLAY TENNIS"                               
The game is very easy.
Press "A" for a forehand, "B" for a backhand and "Opt.1" for a 
smash.
Left, right, up, down, speak for themselves.
The serve: just press A to throw the ball in the air, and press A 
again at the right time to hit the ball.

If you've chosen the right level there appears a square on the 
place where the ball's going to hit the ground.
The squares can be yellow, red and black.
Yellow: just hit the ball after it's hit the ground, forehand or 
backhand.
Red: hit the ball at once (no contact with ground), forehand or 
backhand.
Black: smash the ball over the net.

If you win, you go up on the ladder and if you lose you go down.

It's so simple, I've defeated Jimmy Connors within a month.
Only my brother loses every time.



The ratings:                            ~RACKET.BL2~

Coding: 
It's ok, everything is in the game, net servises to tiebreaks.
But there's only one competition, so no Davis Cup, Roland Garros 
or Flushing Meadow.
       
Graphix: 
They're ok, but the back grounds could be much better.                                              

Sound: 
WOW! It's fantastic. Jimmy's even giving comments while playing 
against him, like "GOOD SHOT", "COME ON" etc.                            

Gameplay: 
Very good indeed, and it's so simple.              

Total: 
I think it's worth buying if you've got a LYNX.
