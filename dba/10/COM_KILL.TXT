COMMODORE DEAD !!


Here's the press release that I got:

 From the Orlando Sentinel, Saturday, April 30, page C1:

 Commodore International Ltd., a pioneer in the personal computer
 industry, said late Friday it is going out of business. The
 company, based in West Chester, Pa., plans to transfer its assets to
 unidentified trustees "for the benefit of its creditors" and has
 placed its major subsidary, Commondore Electronics Ltd., into
 voluntary liquidation. The company last month reported an $8.2 million
 loss for the quarter ending Dec. 31 on sales of $70.1 million. A year
 earlier, Commodore lost $77.2 million on sales of $237.7 million in
 the same period. In the latest report, Commodore said financial
 limits had thwarted its ability to supply products, leading to
 weakened sales.


From what I have read in the latest GEnie Lamp, Atari is out of computers
as well....
