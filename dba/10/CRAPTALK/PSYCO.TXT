Psycotricks to drive people crazy with, are quite easy and in
this article I will tell a few.
Let's start right away with some useful(?) tricks for begin-
ners.

Okay the first trick can be used when your neighbour is 
annoying with loud laughter or music.

You get your big drill and start drilling in the wall on the
neighbours side while playing Metallica on the highest possi-
ble output.
While doing this you sing very loudly an indian war song and
stamp your feet on the rythm of the beat.
I can't tell you exactly what happens afterwards but i'm shure
it will have some effect !

If you are bothered by somekind telephone-maniac-terrorist you
just have to try the following trick,

Call some electronics freak friend and ask him to build a
device that puts a high tone on the telephone.
The general idea is to blast the terrorist his eardrums but
any other (side)effect may also force the maniac to stop.

If your mother won't buy you that Falcon 040 you just have to
a little persistend.
The idea to keep make her that nuts that she will buy you
anything you want,

Okay that's the way you do it,

Make thousands of note's with "Mom i wanna-have-a Falcon 040"
and throw them around the house.
You must also tape the message and play all day and night on a
high volume.
Keep asking your mother over and over again when you get that
Falcon( day and night ).
Hire a plane with the same message behind it and let a car
drive to the streets with an enormous speaker on the roof.
I think that you may conclude afterwards that all this have
cost you more then a Falcon 040 !

Small tip between the lines,
An Amigafreak can not be influenced by psycotricks cos' they
have no brains, so simply beat them up severely !

Now a general trick in scaring people just for the fun of it.

Get a big balloon filled with gas, paint it black and hang a
couple of colored flashlights underneath it.
Go to a shop that sells costumes and buy a martian suit.

As you already can guess , we don't let the balloon float at
night and we DON'T claim to be coming from Mars !
Because martians and UFO's don't excist ( eeehhh what's that
in my backyard ?? ).

AAAAAAHHHRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhh

(mecanical laughter) HAHAHAHAhahahahah !

       in a asylum.
