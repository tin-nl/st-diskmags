In the beginning there was nothing. After that, there was a little more. And 
not a great deal of time later, it was all there where it belonged. In this 
game you play the guy who put it there. 
 
SO THIS IS ANOTHER GOD GAME? 
Well, yes, in fact it is. It might seem similar to some other games in the 
eyes of a non-believer or a moron, but hey, I don't care. The world is full 
of morons, and I don't want to share my deepest feelings with all of them. 
 
WELL, WHAT THE COPULATION IS IT ABOUT THEN? 
In this game you play the ultimate one, the man himself, the dude who is able 
to make a girl out of a steak. Your self-chosen task is to put the Falling 
Stones From Lucifer's Appartment somewhere more useful. For instance, in 
front of your girlfriend's door. She's a real bitch you know. She's a real 
real bitch. And she is strong. Everytime you complete a line of stones, she 
will ram them up into your family home, Heaven. 
 
SO THIS GAME'LL TAKE SOME TIME? 
Yeah, dude, you're right. It'll take some time allright. If you aint got no 
time to play this massively important game, you surely don't have any time to 
read this shitty magazine. 
 
OHH, PLEASE, CAN I PLAY IT TOO? 
Yes, you can. In order to run the game, please double-click with your marmot 
on the so-called 'STACKS.PRG', which you find on this disk. Then wait until 
the message appears. Notice it isn't funny and, in fact, quite insulting. 
Then press space. I mean the button, but you can also try to hitchhike on a 
SpaceShuttle, and press it's big brother up there. Haven't tried that, now 
you mention it. 
 
THIS SUCKS... THOSE STONES JUST FALL DOWN. 
Try pressing the left arrow to move the stone to the left. 
 
COOL! 
What about trying the right arrow? Go on! 
 
LET'S SPEED IT UP, BABY... 
Object used in conjunction with a bow, pointed downwards... 
 
SHIT, THE WORLD IS ROTATING! 
Yes, and you can simulate this effect with the 'pijltje omhoog' key! 
 
HEY DUDES, I HAVE A VIC-20 AND YOUR GAME DOESN'T WORK! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! 
Fuck you. However, you might encounter a few problems when you run the game 
on an Atari Ladybird. Please keep in mind that it was designed for the humble 
ShittyTroubles 520 and 1040 computers designed way back in 1984, and send 
large amounts of money to me for the Birdie version (or wait a few months for 
the next magazine). 
 
OH, YOU'RE SO GOOD... 
As if I didn't know that already. 
 
YEAH, BUT I REALLY MEAN IT. 
Do you think you'd live if you didn't? 
 
PLEASE GREET ME IN YOUR NEXT GAME OR DEMO! 
No way, Jose. 
 
COULD I DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE YOU? 
Yes, send me lots of money. Or send me a nice postcard instead. 
 
WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS THEN? 
You won't write me anyway. Allright, here it is. 
 
Havoc of the Giants, 
Ravenstraat 4, 
6909 DV Babberich, 
Nederland. 
 
Alternatively, you could write to: 
 
Corsair of the Giants, 
Wildshitweg 33, 
1456 AD Neck, 
Nederland. 
 
But I wouldn't advise you to do so. In fact, I would advise you to become a 
real hardcore Andre Hazes fan (like Kurt Cobain was).
