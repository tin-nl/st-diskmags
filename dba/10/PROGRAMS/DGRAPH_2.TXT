History
πππππππ
I began to code Dgraph in fact for Atari ST(e). This one was in 240 
colors on a simple stf. But this version wasn't finish. Certainely 
because i haven't enough motivation to finish it. Cortexx and Morton 
work with my lame shit. Like it was unfinished and bugged, they had 
some problem to graph with it. The second reason that's i never 
finished this program, was because i hate DEGAS look like interface 
(an it look like that's !!!).
One year and half passed and i finally had my FALCON. In my totally 
deception, there is NONE good drawing program on it. Prism paint is 
very slow and lame, and True paint is a big shit. Only Eclipse paint 
(Neochrome master Falcon) is certainely excellent, but for the 
moment it wasn't sell in your shop so... I decided to start to code 
Dgraph for many reasons. Many of us members graphist were 
desapointed that's there is no drawing program without bug (Mic 
drawed one day with Delmpaint 0.9 but this version is very too 
bugged, after this Cortexx try too, but he stopped immediatelly it's 
work...). Some editor have sell some drawing program, but i think 
they haven't understood that graphist don't need a nice interface 
with gem, but a old nice graphixx interface. When i diffuse my first 
version (0.1), i have notice some remark like : the interface look 
like old ST drawing program ! (Also a Dune members said it!) But for 
your informations, the Amiga 1200 have a excellent programm called 
Deluxe paint, and it look like old Amiga concept. On Atari we have 
new concept but NONE good drawing program ! Another reason why i coded
this was for my personnal work. Like i love Neochrome (Mic too) and i 
decided to recode a kind of this type of drawing program.

ShareWare ?
πππππππππππ
Yes, this program is a ShareWare. I hope i will receive some money 
for help me in my motivation too add some news fonctions and 
debugged it ! In the next version (0.4) the unregisted version will 
can't save your work ! So i hope you will understand that's (I hate 
this kind of think but i must do it, my pocket is soon empty !). For 
to be registed you must send 15$ (About 80-90FF) and 2 disks to : 

PIGNARD Arnaud
4 Square Eugäne Varlin
91000 Evry 

You will received the two next version. (For the version 1.0 it will 
be different ! But i have many work before this !) 

Contact me
ππππππππππ
For increase my drawing program, send me all suggestions at the same 
adress. If i'm looking for GIF, PCX, TIF, IFF load and save routine 
and TGA load routine. If you have coded a drawing programm contact 
me too...

Bug, you said bug ?
πππππππππππππππππππ
If you notice any bug on it report me it at the same adress.

What's will do in the future
ππππππππππππππππππππππππππππ
- Bezier courbe (like Deluxe paint AMIGA)
- Differents loupe weight
- More format to load and save
- Less bug (Is there one ?)
- More functions in block (Rotate, zoom bloc, 3d...)
- Lasso mode (Like Neochrome master)
- Improve palette edition
- Inverse the functions selected 
- A better eraser
- Slide Show mode
- and many more ...

************************************************************************

- I have some problem in my code with the XBIOS 5. So please run DGRAPH in a
  40 columes mode for a fun compatibility. (Fileselector)
  My problem was, when i change screen for about 10 times the XBIOS 5 fonction
  crash with a wrong video adress and with 2 bombes !

- When you swap in fullscreen and to menuscreen the bloc will don't put where
  it was before. Easy to modify, but no times ...

- For the moment STE palettes will don't be load with a P?1 FORMAT.

- When you cut a block you have no problems, but if you put it and forgot
  it to delete from the block ram before you press space. The falcon
  will freeze this bug in the screenaddress. Now if you cut a new block
  and will put it and delete it correct. Press Space and then any other
  menu point. The program will set the block you have cut and deleted from
  the block ram a half screen under the your block you have sets.....

Palette
πππππππ
When you select copy, i copy the select color in a buffer (For the 
moment i don't found any good idea for display the color in the copy 
buffer so, if you have an idea, write me fast !).
When you select paste, i copy the color into the select color.
The fonction transparence will make the calcul betwen two color, one 
selected (how will be erase be the transparent color) and the color 
in the buffer.
The load and save palette fonction save a palette in 1024 octets 
like this: RRGG00BB. So  Long red, Long green, Long free, Long blue.

Cut
πππ
It's similary of Neochrome cut fonction. For the moment, i cut the 
bloc on the picture for a free move and paste. You can paste your 
bloc selected by pressing the right botton (like neochrome master), 
in this case, the bloc would be put in the picture, but you can also 
move it again.
You can flip the bloc by pressing the arrow keys.

Load
ππππ
For the moment the DC1 format isn't finish, it will be a compacted 
version

The DG1 version work very well. The format is :

3 octets : DGU      = DGRAPH UNPACKED
1 octets : 1        = Version of the type of this format
2 octets : Taille X = Largeur de l'image
2 octets : Taille Y = Hauteur de l'image 
1024 oct.: Palette  = Palette of 256 colors in .L per composant
64000 oc.: Image    = Image 8 plans entrelace(Not like Amiga format)

Dgraph can also load :

PI1 or PC1, a good old format on Atari ST. For the moment, i have 
some little problem to load Ste palette (Easy to fix, but no time to 
do it...)

TPI Very usefull for import image from True Paint, and like Dgraph 
don't know PC picture standard, you can load it with True Paint and, 
Dgraph will load it. (Only picture save with a taille of 320*200 in 
256 colors are better)

DOO Very nice format for coders (Especially when we save an image 
with MonTT). In the future i will put a alert box for some 
parameters like : number of plans.

PI9 is the DELMPAINT drawing format. 1024 octecs for the palette and 
64000 octets for the picture

Save
ππππ
DG1 work very well

PI9 work very well

PI1 Some problem with the palette, but save the first 4 plans

DOO work very well

TGA normaly work very well (Very good for transfert your picture for 
Gemview to another format !) Add: Load it with GemView or Studio Photo !

Disk tools
ππππππππππ
Don't work for the moment, use a fileseletor ...

Drawing fonctions
πππππππππππππππππ
Very easy to use, draw and that's all (for the moment !)

Fixed zoom
ππππππππππ
For the moment only the draw mode work. Wait for the fill and line mode.
When you press MOUSE K. the programm will modify the fonction of the right
botton : Select color 2 or Take the color behing the mouse in color 1.
