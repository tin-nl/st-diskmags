You remember my old BLUE Mouse-pad picture, and its dithers...?
Why so shitty blue ? Is it because blue is the darkest colour ?
You'll understand, reader !

* You often use a drawing software, like Degas Elite.
  You thought 16 colours were too few for your virtual masterpieces.
* You often play on the StF or StE very limited colours.
  You wondered how you could get easily many more (in PI1,NEO,IFF).
* You dribbled on the VGA+ 16 Millions colours.
  You wanna find the RGB Mystery.

First of all you must know why some colours lack, while others are useless.
                     ._______________________.
It is because of the |RRRRRR   GGGGGG BBBBBB | pixel.
                     |RR   RR GG      BB   BB|
                     |RR   RR GG      BB   BB|

Why '213' ?!
Because in each pixels, releasing a grey (total-blend) dot,
like 777 (white), Green is the lightest, an Blue the darkest.

A (real) white pixel (speaking light, not contrast) (= 777),
is therefore the maximum state of brightness, which is 100%.
    In those 100%. just know that the Blue piece
    has a proportion of about 10% ! (Red is three times...)

When you change the RGB values (3 equal numbers) to get another grey,
the percentage doesn't differ at all.
But when one or all the RGB digits are different, there's a problem,
which comes from the fact that the grey scales are curves.(Baah! Maths.)

-  So, you only have to remember that when doing grey colours,
   the RGB values are different, although it doesn't seem to.
-  For coloured greys or vivid colours, just change the RGB values
   in this order : B then R then G to get nearest bright-colours.

Try this Lipton :
BLACK > BLUE > RED > MAGENTA > GREEN > CYAN > YELLOW > WHITE
(start)   .     .      (grey (both!)     .      .   (end(wrap))

And try this sequence :
000 , 001 , 100 , 101 , 010 , 011 , 110 , 111 , 112 , 211 , 212 , 121 , ...
you'll understand how the RGB values work.

Hey, man !  It is thus possible to get more greys than expected !?

Before leaving you to the main subject of this article,
do you really know how to get marvelous unseen colours ?
    You'll have to dither (in a clean way), and for each dither,
    you'll have to change one step upper the colour value.
Which value ?  ONLY the Blue one in fact, (see the 16MCOLOR.picture).
If you had changed the Red, or especially the Green value,
your dither would have been more visible, and thus it'd been useless...

* DIFFICULT COLOURS :
                      The DARKest    and    the LIGHTest ones.
        = e.g. Around black-->blue   and   yellow-->white.
                      """"""""""""         """"""""""""""
- The first (darker) are lacking (despite of the fact that, when very dark,
                              the unseen colours don't seem to...)
e.g. do try a purple palet. (The most difficult colour for painters.)
                             -Fake Bonus-Note : "I know, Jovis..."-
- The second (lighter) are often useless (coz 2 brit').
e.g. 770 -> 777 (yellow->white) or  070 -> 077 (green->cyan).

When you draw (create a palet), or when you dither,
those difficult colours should be taken back !
e.g. 070 -> 077 : 3 first green (thus blue...) are the same.
                                                   -USELESS-
I don't bother if you didn't mind reading these RGB explanations...

Shame on you !  It was deadly important !!!!!!!!!!! !!!! !!! !! ! !
Now let's go to the target of this crapartikl.
-=====================================-=====-===-==-=-=--=--- -- - -  -
 -  - - -- ---=--=-=-==-===-=====-=====================================-

   We wanna see how it is possible to dither between two colours.
(With three or more colours, just put the dither farther and loop.)

  - You remember the ASCII ARTICLES in the DBA MAG #9  ?
  - You enjoyed the way we dithered from black to white  ?
  - You managed to dither your pictures or texts  ?

GOood !!   Now  let's perform your technique ! (On any computer again...)
__________________________________________________ _____ ___ __ _ _  _
To do so (dithering..), we have mainly 3 MEANS ;
  1) Using the software filling-presets (patterns),
  2) 'Plotting' dots yourself,
  3) Making dotted lines.
=== =================================-=====-===-==-=-=--=--- -- - -  -
 I   DITHERING USING THE SOFTWARE FILLING-PRESETS (PATTERNS) : ( by jovis )
_I_ """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

 A > USING THE (MONO.) FILLING-BOXES (rectangles or squares):
 
You can get a lot of colours (hues) through this option.
Knowing that the filling-box has a maximum number of full pixels,
 we can get its average percentage, which is the 50% blend (grey).
 
FOR INSTANCE with a  20 x 20  (square) filling-box,
    the minimum number of white (=empty ) pixels is 0, while
    the maximum number of black (=filled) pixels is 400 (20x20).
 The right average percentage in pixels is thus 200 (white or black)
 and had to be calculated like this : 400 x 50% or better 400 / 2 .

Do you understand what I mean by all this ?
In fact, yes !  For the best of you, you should have understood
that when you change the average-blend value you get another hue.

Let's take our example and modify the 'middle' blend-point.
    With 25% of black we get 100 filled pixels (400 x 25%),
    with 75% of   "   "   "  300   "      "    (400 x 75%).

Now we have 4 possible greys in such a pattern (20x20 filling-box);
   -  0 % of black pixels --==>  0  filled one (out of 400)
   - 25 % of black pixels --==> 100 filled one (out of 400)
   - 50 % of black pixels --==> 200 filled one (out of 400)
   -100 % of black pixels --==> 400 filled one (out of 400).
 ( For more intermediate greys you'll have to do it by yourself.)

It's high time to use our little example of grey-patterns, isn't it ?
How ?  Simply by counting yourself the pixels of your dither...

For instance we want a 50% grey pattern ;
 here it is ! (Rem: you should see squares, not rectangles down there!)

     This method is really convenient with even patterns ;
e.g. 10x8, 15,15, 16x16, 20x20, 13x17 pixels filling-boxes...

     So when you draw a pattern, there mustn't be any problem
     with the borders (esp. for dithers like '1010101010')...

But in any way, in any software, you'll be to count by yourself
all the pixels till you get the right percent-number ('grey').
__________________________________________________ _____ ___ __ _ _  _
 B > USING THE INTERMEDIATE DITHERED COLOURS (esp. on PC):

* Where can we find or get such ditherings ?
 - Mainly in drawing programs, in the Filling option,
 - or you must draw them (then cut,copy; cut,c... !).
In softwares we won't be able to change them.
So, the hand-made dither isn't so bad.
Think about it !

* What will we use these dithered colours for ?
 - For longer displayed colours,
 - for better, wider blends. (Speaking 2 colours.)
In any case it is cleaner than the random-fill (Deluxe Paint).
But it depends on your need, and the blurred texture (esploded-shit)
can be interesting sometimes (journalists think so...).
 HERE ARE THE CUBES !

Rem: for a many colours dither (only one after the other) ;

-Color A-  Number 1 ---> N.8 ---> N.15 ---> -C.B-  N.0 (16)  (...) -C.C-...

 I I  'PLOTTING' DOTS YOURSELF :  ( by jovis )
_I_I_ """""""""""""""""""""""""

       We can do this conscienciously, or in a very dirty way.
Of course I prefer and recommend you the first option...
It is by using the SQUARE DITHERS. (Look above, right-side !)
The center of your dither = 50% blend-point, should be :
                          X.X.X.X.
                          .X.X.X.X
                          X.X.X.X.
                          .X.X.X.X
So, like painters, when you dither dot after dot, remember that
There are THREE MAIN STATES of light (and dither);
   black        --->        grey        --->        white
  ........                X.X.X.X.                XXXXXXXX
  ........                .X.X.X.X                XXXXXXXX
  ........                X.X.X.X.                XXXXXXXX
  ........                .X.X.X.X                XXXXXXXX

( Note that, except for ES (who is clever), the idea is spreaded that
  this grey can be used as a colour itself !  That's WRONG !
Even if we can use this trick to draw (I use it a lot too!),
  we should use it ONLY AS A (an optic-) COLOURING TRICK !!
The difference consists in its use ;
- to draw juicy, soft girl's skin please hide your dithered pixels,
  so that she doesn't look hairy, shaggy like a bear (a fantasy ?).
  > Change the palet, soften the colours.
- Some people, like Dhole and especially Spaz, are doing great use
  of this plotting technique. But !...
 1-They should understand that it is a funny idea to show their
   wasted time in pointing when it's useless (Spaz, ...).
   > Try to paint undithered on Falcon (by overlayed bands).
 2-Pictures become pale like Death ! (Dhole,Niko, ...)
   > Add some contrast to the colours, colour the colours !
- When the texture is smooth, it is smooth !
  > No dither there.
- Glass, metal (chrome), plastic, soft wood (paper), water, clouds :
  > No dither (or little and clean (square) !).
- Sand, stone, rough wood, (thick leaf) plants, other not smooth textures :
  > No clean (well square) dithers > random-fill sometimes...(Useful ?)

ES understood that sand, or stone textures aren't nice with pixels
  displayed in a square way (the cleanest one everywhere else however).
Spaz didn't understand so, and thinks skin is like wood, like stone, ...).
Tanis (still drawing on Atari ?) only thought gold (yo !) was like glass !

This middle-grey is still visible. Thus :

WELL DISPLAYING THE GREYS (not colors yet) :
Example;
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..............................OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..............................OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..............................OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..............................OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
\________20________/\_____________30_____________/\________20________/

1- Find the middle to blend (two here coz two colours):
XXXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X............O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X..........O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X............O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X..........O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOO
\__20/2__/\______10+10_______/\rest(10)/\______10+10_______/\__20/2__/

2- Add two 'X' and two 'O' greys:
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X....................O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X..........O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X....................O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
XXXXXXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X..........O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOOOOOO
\___10___/\___/\___10___/\___/\___10___/\___/\___10___/\___/\___10___/
          \____grey_X:_20____/          \____grey_O:_20____/
                         \____middle:_20____/
  It's not over, but you can see that  what we're looking for,
is to get bands of the same size (20 pixels here).
  Now (at the end), let's touch those greys up a little.
So we need more greys :
          V                 V                V                V
....  ........ ........ ..X...X. X.X.X.X. X.XXX.XX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  XXXX
....  ...X...X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .XXX.XXX  XXXX
....  ........ ........ X...X... X.X.X.X. XXX.XXX. XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX  XXXX
....  .X...X.. .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X .X.X.X.X XX.XXX.X  XXXX

3- In our example:
XXXXXXXXX.XXX.X.X.X.X.X.X...X...X....O...O...O.O.O.O.O.O.OOO.OOOOOOOOO
XXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X..O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOO
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.X.X.X.X.X.X...X........O...O.O.O.O.O.O.OOO.OOO.OOO.OOO
XXXXXX.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X.X..O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.O.OOOOOO
You see that  there are less points at the centre (better blend).

Let's put an end to this long  chapter II.
I'd want to warn you that these hand-dotted dithers work with curves too.
Always remember to use them for fitted textures, or hide them (colour)...
always remember to share equally the surfaces to be dithered or not(center)
always remember to point the pixels in a 'square way' (and lozenge)...
always remember to put the darker pixel at the right place (.X.X not X.X.) 

I won't show you how to add some more pixels (greys) at the very end.
I won't show you how to blend 'X' and 'O' (easy).
I won't show you how a dark pixel can do a grey one near a light pixel.
I won't show you how Dan Malone does his ditherings.
I won't show you how to make real plotted textures.

It's a big work, no ?
(And I don't speak of bigger, colourful, drawn patterns used as dithers !)

 I I I   MAKING DOTTED LINES :  ( by jovis )
_I_I_I_ """""""""""""""""""""

As I don't have room enough here to speak about this excellent chapter III,
 do refer to my 16MCOLOR picture, which uses this dithering strange method.
 (Rip it, I'll be glad, and play with the colours (Blue...).)
If you want only vertical or only horizontal very long dithered surfaces,
 you are welcome here ! Think about the thrift of colours...
 Two colours are enough to dither through all the screen.

Normally such dotted lines are done through a program-editor (GFA,..).
 It's because we must count the pixels.
To my mind, I'm the first who used this technique and, to understand,
 the result is a little like in the background of the game Vaxine (StF),
 but far cleaner, and miles more stretched !
Be careful ! Hide the bows or tiangles (you'll see them (<decimal point)!).

Bla, bla, bla, baah!  Here's an EXAMPLE (do make yours and better ones !):
We'll skip one line after the other, to get a long dither.
( To easily get it twice longer, we'll repeat the dotted line.)
We'll dither the first line all the screen long, then the second line.

Rem: 1st line below gets into:
(one line '.') ;(=ENTER) ("".) ; .............X ; ("") ; ......X ; () ;
....X () ; ...X () ; ...X..X () ; ..X ; () ;
and you must repeat all the line long the dither. This one for instance:
3.X/2.X,0. --> ...X..X...X..X...X..X...X..X...X..X(and so on) +one line '.'
___________.___.__._.._... .. .  .   .
OK ?  Let's go !
0., 0.; 13.X, 0.; 6.X, 0.; 4.X, 0.; 3.X, 0.; 3.X/ 2.X, 0.; 2.X, 0.;
2.X/ 2.X/ 1.X, 0.; 2.X/ 1.X/ 1.X, 0.; 2.X/ 1.X/ 1.X/ 1.X, 0.;
1.X, 0.; (1st middle)
2X./ 1X./ 1X./ 1X., 0.; 2X./ 1X./ 1X., 0.; 2X./ 1X., 0.; 2X./ 2X./ 1X., 0;
2X., 0.; 3X./ 2X., 0.; 3X., 0.; 4X., 0.; 6X., 0.; 13X., 0.; (main middle)

Now reverse all these dotted-lines (and blank(.) ones, and do the same
 for the (only one) '.'line -> 'X'. Then the two lines will be 'X'...
Next we'll hide the bows or triangles (not shown nor done...).
                                                                      jovis
