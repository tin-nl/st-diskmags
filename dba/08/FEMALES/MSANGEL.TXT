Better
======

I am impaired
but not broken
I will fight, it must!
Alone and afraid
I am waiting on the moment
Somebody say to me
everything is alright now

The birds will sing for me
the wind blows through my hair
I am walking outside
and can't believe
with you my darling
it's true!

*****      WHEN YOU HAVE SORROW THEN THERE BREAKS SOMETHING    *****

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you are sad, something breaks. A broken heart or the feeling you
aren't complete anymore. The world is empty without you. That will say
how risky life is with all his possibilities and to attach to much to 
something or someone. When someone takes it, there's an emptyness,
sadness. Something what goes away for always that is pain and that
breaks you. What you have lost comes never back again. That's a really
bad thought but you must live with that. A piece accomplishment of
your own live is disappeared. That gives you a hole in your heart.
Sorrow will show you how vulnerable you are as a human. It's a fight
against despair. Live gives you sadness and sadness deeped life.
It makes an appeal on power. That's the reason life and sadness
is ONE. Without sadness you haven't lived!

!!!!!!!!!!                   FIRST AID             !!!!!!!!!!!

__________________________________________________________________________

First aid aims to preserve life, promote recovery and prevent aggravation
of the injury or condition until professional help arrives.


"PRIORITIES"

Danger: ensure none to yourself or casualty.
Reassure: airway, breathing, bloodcirculation must be established
immediately if the casualty is unconscious in order to prevent
permanent injury, brain damage can occur after only three minutes
without oxygen.

* Airway: the passage between the mounth, nose, throat and windpipe
(the airway) must be kept open and clear.

* Breathing: this must be established and maintained.

* Bloodcirculation: It must be confirmed that the heart is still beating
  and the circulation is adequate. Severe bleeding must be stopped and 
  Shock must be treated.



ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION 
**********************

1.      Check for danger
2.      Shake and call
3.      Open the airway
4.      Look, listen and feel for Breathing
5.      Check mouth for obstructions
6.      Resposition the Airway
7.      Seal casualty's nose by pinching nostrils closed with 
        finger and thumb
8.      Take e deep breath, seal your lips over over casuality's lips
        and inflate lungs, watch chest rise
9.      Take your head away, take a lung full of fresh air and repeat 
        step 8 again
10.     Check pulse at neck
11.     When present and casualty is not breathing continue 
        inflations at resuscitation rate of 12-16 breaths per
        minute 


DROWNING
========

1. If not breathing, start resuscitation immediately
2. Keep casualty dry and warm and arrange for urgent removal 
   to hospital

STRAINS
=======

1. Rest the affected part
2. Prepare ice compress
3. Elevate, this helps reduce swelling
4. If in doubt treat as a fracture
5. Seek medical advice


BURNS AND SCALDS
================

1. Immerse in or place under running cold water for ten minutes or
   until pain ceases
2. Do not remove burnt clothing

4. Do not prick blisters
5. Never put oil/grease on a burn

7. Remove constricting items such as rings and watches
8. In severe cases call for an ambulance and treat the
   casualty for shock

SCALDED MOUTH AND THROAT

2. If she is conscious, wash her mouth out with cold water to
   cool the tissues, then give her frequent sips of cold water
3. Loosen any tight clothing around the casualty's neck and chest
4. Get the casualty to hospital as soon as possible
5. If the casualty is unconscious, place her in the recovery 
   position
6. Be prepared to resuscitate, throats swell up very quickly
7. Remember never give an unconscious persone anything by mouth


SPLINTERS

1. Clean the area around the splinter with soap and water
2. Sterilise a pair of tweezers by passing them through 
   the flame from a match or lighter
3, Allow the twezzers to cool. Do not wipe soot off or touch
   ends
4. Holding the tweezers as near to the skin as possible, grasp
   the end of the splinter. gently pull the splinter out in 
   oppossite directionto that which it enterd the skin
5. If the splinter breaks, do not continue, seek medical aid

A change on hapiness
and tenderness

And now my darling

the words what i must really
say, for a long time ago now
i hope so 
that then my heart is 
calm again
and have found in you
my dreamprince...

MISERABLE
=========

Sometimes life can be so difficult
A day can become so awful
 
It can be when you receive bad news
or when all things go wrong in one time

When you see each day the problems at tv
or newspaper about the 3th world

That's really awful !
and then we should realise

That we must not complain when you 
live in a first world country 

There are people with an awful life
They have AIDS or are HUNGRY or there's WAR

So when i feel very sad then  
i can do something about that  

I can do things what i really like
to lose my sad feelings

Why there isn't a future
and why couldn't you wait on me 
 
Yes i know not every day is sunny 
But i know our dream is over now

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

So guys this was it for this time and i hope that you all liked it
(hi Dadu). I hope i will see you all in the next magazine of the D.B.A.
Nice days on your school or your work! And when you have time for
it send an article to our D.B.A. magazine. We need people who
write for us al the time.
