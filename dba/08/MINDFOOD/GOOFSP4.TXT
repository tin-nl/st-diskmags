------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Princess Bride
-In the beginning when the grandfather arrives with the book.  He opens
the book, the camera angle switches, and the book is closed and gets
opened a second time.

# The Prize
-Watch Paul Newman's hands when he jumps to the cargo net on the ship; you can
see a pair of gloves briefly appear when his hand reaches for the railing, 
and just as quickly disappear as he swings over.  Didn't want to hurt his 
dainty little hands, no doubt.  Whatta wimp.

# Raiders of the Lost Ark 
-In the scene where Indy and Marion emerge from their entombment
in the crypt after crashing through a wall with a statue. Indy pushes a 
massive stone block out of the outside wall - and you can see from the block's
shadow that when it hits the ground, it bounces!
-In the same scene, I noticed that when Indy and Marion run down the slope
from the wall, there is an unconcious man sitting under the hole left by
the rock. His presence is left unexplained (or is it an intentional joke?). 
-Note the tell-tale reflection of the glass pane that keeps Harrison Ford 
safe during his tete-a-tete with the cobra.
-Indy goes to Marion's bar to get the medallion.  She tells him to get 
lost.  After he leaves she sits down and pulls the medallion, which she is 
wearing on a chain around he neck, out of her blouse.  Straight-on shot of 
Meriam looking at the medallion with the chain still around her neck.  Cut 
to a profile shot where she is still looking at the medallion and the chain 
is no longer around her neck.
-When the truck explodes, you can see the pole shooting out of the bottom
of it to make it tip over as if the explosion was real.
-When Indy finds Marion in the tent after he thinks she is dead, he unties 
the gag in her mouth. He then ties it back catching a lot of her hair in 
it. The camera changes, and there is no more hair caught in the gag.
-When they go to see the old man about the writing on the medalion,
he tells them that the staff should be 6 kadams to which Indy states
that is about 72 inches.  Then the old man says to remove 1 kadam.
Simple math dictates that the staff should be 60 inches or 5 feet tall.
When Indy is later in the map room, he inserts the staff into the
hole and the mounted medalion is over his head.  I don't think Harrison
Ford is less than 5 feet tall.


# Return of the Jedi
-When Luke is explaining to Threepio about the 'magic', Artoo is NOT tied up.
(Letterboxed version only)

# Roadhouse
-Before Patrick Swayze punches the tall, goofy guy in his boss's office, 
you can see some of the blood come out of the guy's nose before he's 
punched!!!

# Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves
-When Robin returns to England and throws himself on the ground, he offers his
hand to his Moorish slave.  In a subsequent shot, he is offering his other
hand.

# Robocop
-When the disgruntled ex-city official is blasted out of the window of
City Hall, he falls out of screen. During the replay of the scene for
the "news" immediately afterward, the stunt man's feet are seen popping
up into view as he bounces on the padding and rolls to take the impact.
[This may have been intentional]
- In the scene where Clarence is showing off his new "toy" gun to his
pals, he gets back in his Brand New SUX to have the rear view mirror fall
down.

# Rocky Horror Picture Show
-In the scene where Brad and Janet are being undressed, Brads Sweater is 
removed and his shirt is already unbuttoned. Later Riff Raff walks by, and 
then Magenta unbuttons it.
-During the Time Warp, one of the Transylvanians hands another an 
hors d'ouevres tray, and then immediately has it back in his hands again.
-During "Dammit, Janet", Janet drops her purse in back of her.  Later
in the scene, when she bends down to get the ring, it is in front of her.
-Frank does not hit Eddie with the pick until he is well within the freezer, 
but when he emerges, there is a long trail of blood leading into it.
-At the end of the movie, Brad and Janet carry Dr. Scott out of the castle - 
no wheelchair.  But later, as the scene begins to spin, you can see
Dr. Scott lying on the ground next to his crushed wheelchair!

# Scarface
-Set in 1980, the movie includes a billboard for a 1984 Corvette
and a vending machine for USA Today, which began in 1982.

# See No Evil/Hear No Evil 
-Pryor & Wilder are on the run from the police.  They ditch the
stolen police car that they were driver into a muddy bog.  Their clothes
end up being covered in mud. In next scene, they show up squeaky clean.

# The Shining 
-During the opening with the aerial view of the car climbing up the 
lonely mountain road, the shadow of the helicopter is visible for more 
than just brief moment.  
-Jack Nicholson hacks through one of two thin panels in a bathroom door.
In a later scene, you can clearly see that both panels have been hacked 
through.  According to Maltin, Kubrick cut the film by 4 minutes after 
its premiere.  I guess more ax work by Nicholson must have been what was cut.

# A Shock to the System (Michael Caine)
-A detective questions Michael Caine's secretary and writes down his 
telephone number on a piece of notepad paper for her.  Later, when she decides
to call him, she has his business card.

# The Silence of the Lambs
-When Jodie Foster goes into the first girl's room, her father says
that the room has been left the way it was when she died. But, there's
a Debbie Harry "Def, Dumb & Blonde" poster on the wall; that album was
released in 1989, 3 years(?) after the girl died.
-When we first see Dr. Lector in the "courthouse cage", we hear his 
cassette player playing. I looked very closely, and noticed that the 
tape wheels on the cassette are *not* turning.

# Silent Running
-Someone hits Bruce Dern's left leg with a shovel.  Later, his 
right leg is the one that is injured.

# Spartacus
-Watch for the truck driving along the hills behind a battle scene.

# Splash
-When the mermaid (Daryl Hannah) steps on land for the first time,
she is supposed to be totally nude. The director tries to convey her
nudity WITHOUT actually showing her nude body thus:
As she walks towards that crowd, the camera alternates between
her bare back (waist upwards) and her bare legs. EXCEPT that in the
first shot, you can see Hannah wearing blue jeans (!!) and in the
second, she is wearing a long brown(?) shirt!! Someone was very
careless somewhere!
-Scene where Tom Hanks has the lid off the outboard motor while
he is trying to start it.  The motor starts suddenly, throwing
him overboard.  Next shot has the boat spinning around with the
lid magically back on the motor.

# Star Trek II
-The blood-stain on Kirk's uniform (from Scotty's dying relative) changes
size & position.
-During the battle in the nebula, Khan pulls debris off of a comrade,
who says something to him and dies with his eyes open. As Khan leans 
over him the dead man's eyes briefly follow his face and then close when 
Khan puts his arms around him.

# Star Trek IV
-In the dinner scene, the candle in the middle of the table changes postion 
all the time.

# Star Wars
-In the scene where the heroes are being interrogated by the
stormtroopers (after entering a spaceport), the position and number 
of stormtroopers varies from shot to shot. 
-When the stormtroopers break into the control room, one of them bangs his 
head on the door.
-In the trash compactor, Carrie Fisher is anticipating her cue by
getting ready to lift the metal(?) bar BEFORE the compactor begins to
close (a good second or two.)
-After Luke destroys the Death Star and lands, Leia runs up to him yelling
"Luke!". Luke's response is "Carrie!" (as in Carrie Fisher).(some prints only)
-When we are looking from behind the pilot's chair in the Millenium Falcon
as they go into hyperspace, the actors and the cockpit of the MF are in
black and white.
-As the film is nearly 15 years old, it is easy to see the cut-outs used
for the TIE-fighter gel scenes.
-After Vader kills Ben, there's a shot from the docking bay towards Vader. 
They forgot to color in his lightsaber.


# Stripes 
-During the part of the film where Harold Ramis stops Bill Murray from 
deserting, there is a "goof". From one angle, while Murray is laying 
on the ground with Ramis on top of him, Murray has his pack under 
his head, while in another angle, it is to his side. 

# Sudden Impact
-In the scene where Harry is practicing with his .44 AutoMag, and his partner 
sneaks up in his car, we get to see the camera, dolly and operator
reflected in the car window just before the door opens.

# Supercarrier
-Aircraft regularly change paint schemes (including serial numbers)
during flight.

# Supergirl
-The posters show her flying over New York City near the Statue of
Liberty... and the Statue is holding her torch up in her *left* hand.

# Superman IV
-When the Statue of Liberty is thrown down on the street, we see it clearly
fitting easily between two high-rises, and it seems to be only three or
four stories high.
-Capes of both supermen ruffle when they are on the moon.

# Terminator
-In the scene where Arnold goes to kill Sarah in her apartment (but
ends up killing her roommate), her roommate accidentally knock the
phone off the table (you can see and hear this).  Shortly after,
the phone rings.

# Thelma and Louise
- In the scene in the bar, Geena Davis's glass of coke is delivered full, she
picks it up and it is half empty.  Then she puts in down, and it is 3/4 full
again. Also, she takes a large drink from her shot glass, and in the next shot
we see her sipping from a full glass.

# That Was Then, This Is Now
-At the end of the film, the protagonist (not Estevez) gets off a bus to visit
his girlfriend at work (behind the counter in a hospital cafe).
The shot looks out the hospital doors as the bus pulls up and
the protagonist climbs off.  The buses marquee clearly reads
"Chartered".

# Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines
-The scene with the train: in the background, right in the center of some 
shots, are those concrete towers typical of nuclear power stations...

# Three Men and a Baby
-About 60 mins into the movie, Ted Danson is showing off the baby to
his mother. The camera pans across a window, and the shape of a little
boy is visible in the window - obviously a ghost :-).

# Thriller (Michael Jackson):
-As he's walking with his girlfriend and singing (after they leave the movie
house) you'll see the shadow of the camera cart in view.

# Time Bandits.  
-The scene where the bandits are trapped in the cage
by "Evil" over what appears to be a bottomless chasm.  They make their
escape by cutting small strips of rope off of the support rope and
makeing a long rope from the fragments.  Then, one of the bandits is
lowered out of the cage and is swung up to the next cage.  During the 
scene where they are trying to get the swing high enough for the 
guy on the end of the rope to grab ahold of the other cage, you can
easily see the floor of whatever set they are on.  The bandit appears
to be only a few feet off the floor.   Oops...

# Top Gun
-At the end of the movie when maverick lands on the deck after shooting 
down all the baddies, Slider(iceman's partner) picks maverick up sort of 
bear hug style. Well before he picks him up maverick doesn't have his 
sunglasses on, but when he has been lifted up they have magically 
appeared on his face! If you don't believe me check it out!!

# The Town that Dreaded Sundown (Ben Johnson)
-Near the end of the movie, during the climactic chase, on foot,
the killer manages to run in front of a freight train and put
it between himself and his pursurers.  A long shot shows train
and characters running and then close shots from the train show 
the characters running along side.  In the long shot, the 
camera used in the close shots (and the camera man) can be seen
on a flatcar.

# Total Recall 
-In the 'elevator' scene, Richter and his men are running to the elevator...
past a blue screen.
-Just after Arnie has killed his first four he goes back to his apartment and
talks to his wife.  He places boths hands on either side of her head and
pretty much immediately afterwards he shows her his blood covered hands.
She doesn't of course have any blood on her face! (NB. This may not be
a goof, but a clue to show that Arnie is only dreaming. That's the
continuity man's story anyway...)
-In the last scene in the movie, Arnie and his Dream Girl are kissing, the
camera pulls back to show the Martian landscape... except for the lop left
hand side of the screen where the clips holding the back projection screen
are visible (may not be visible if the projector is not lined up right).


# Tremors
-As the camera is panning up the side of Michael Gross' and Reba McEntire's
"fortress", it goes past a window. In the window you can make out a
reflection of some guy standing on the ground nearby wearing a red hat
and white shorts. Due to the nature of the plot at this point, it is safe
to say that he *ISN'T* supposed to be there.
-(Near the end of the movie) As one of the brave men makes a run for it, 
you can see the ground beneath his feet WOBBLE as if he had run across a 
ditch covered by a piece of plywood.  Oops, now we know how they did the 
mechanical effects for the underground monsters :-)

# True Stories
-David Byrne is cruising around in his jumbo red convertible. His rearview
mirror is present in the interior shots but removed for shots through
the windshield. Very common in movie scenes where a car is driven.

# Twins
-During a conversation between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny
DeVito in a bar restroom, a bottle of beer shifts from one
towel dispensor to another.

# The Two Jakes
-Although the film is set in 1948, Jack Nicholson strolls past
an automatic teller machine.

# 2001
(Loads of 'technical' goofs, relating to vacuums, weightlessness
and space physics. These would not be noticed by most people. Here's
some of the more obvious ones to keep the 2001 fans at bay:-)
-The rotating space station changes its direction of rotation three times.
-Stars in the background drift slowly past the spaceship.
-The hibernating astronauts are shown lying in different positions at
different times.

# The Untouchables
-When Sean Connery is talking to Kevin Costner in his (Connery's)
room, Connery's shirt collar alternates between being buttoned and 
and unbuttoned in the several shots of that scene.
-When the knife-man is sneaking into Sean Connery's apartment, there is a POV
shot as the camera approaches a window.  The camera and cameraman are clearly
reflected in the window.  (He is wearing a white shirt and a red cap, as I 
recall.)

# The Viking Queen
-One of the characters in this 1st Century AD epic is clearly wearing a
wristwatch.

# War Games
-The General yells "Send out the F-15's", and footage shows F-16's
taking off.

# Weekend at Bernie's. 
-In one of the scenes where the two guys are trying to deal with Bernie's 
corpse inside his house, Jonathan Silverman is alternately barefooted and 
wearing shoes every 2 seconds, as we switch from medium to long shot.  
Fire that continuity person!

# When Harry Met Sally 
-Billy Crystal spits the seeds on the window and then says, "I'll open 
the window."  The next shot shows the outside of the car driving on 
the highway, Billy's window is closed. (He may have said: "Next time
I'll open the window". Anyone know?)

# Who Framed Roger Rabbit
- In one scene, Judge Doom is walking towards Eddie Valiant, and we can see
that there are some ping-pong balls in front of him.  In the reverse angle
shot, the balls have disappeared.

# The Wizard Of Oz
-In the wonderful dance scene where Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, 
you will notice her hair length change quite a few times.
-The wire holding the Lion's tale is visible during his solo
"If I Were King of the Forest".
-As they prepare to skip down the road in the closing shot, look
in the woods in the far background. You can see a person scrouching
down, possibly a camera man. He can be seen twice clearly.

# The Wrong Box
-The Victorian-age London houses have TV antennae on them.

# Xanadu
-An early scene in the movie has Gene Kelly at the beach sitting
on a rock, playing his clarinet, as the sun rises over the 
(Pacific) ocean. (No, it wasn't Australia.)

# Zulu
-In this reenactment of the 1879 stand at Rorke's Drift, several of the
Zulu warriors are wearing the wrist watches the extras had been paid with.
