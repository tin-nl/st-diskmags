DALEKS

                       --- A REAL GOLDEN OLDIE ---
                              --- DALEKS ---

Daleks was one of the first classics to be converted to the ST. It has a 
very simple principle. You are the hero, who is being chased by the Daleks.
The Daleks are very stupid robots who can only chase you by getting as close
as possible to you. There are 8 directions in which they move, and you can 
move in the same directions too. There, however, is one major difference 
between the Daleks and you: intelligence. And another major difference is 
the Teleport. By pressing 'T' you will be teleported to a random place in 
the playing field. A less useful option is the 'Sonic Screwdriver', which
kills all the Daleks less than one field from you.

The version of Daleks I tested was written in 1986 by Brian McClendon, but
it still is one of the best I've ever seen (only 15 kilobyte in size when
packed with Atomik 3.5).
