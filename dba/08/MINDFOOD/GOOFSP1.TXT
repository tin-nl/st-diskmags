------------------------------------------------------------------
Please send your contributions/corrections/donations/suggestions to 
muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au. Please DO NOT POST to the net, as I may not see 
your posting, and it bugs the people who are not interested in this 
rubbish.

Contributions should be in the following format:

# Movie Title
-blah blah 

Notes:
-Visible boom mikes aren't really goofs unless they are appear in some
unexpected way (eg reflection, hit actor on the head).

-I prefer goof reports which are short, specific, and about new or very
well-known movies. Picking faults in B-Grades isn't very sporting!

-Please realize that there are multiple versions of films, depending on
the location, time, or format of the screening, and that a goof might not
be in every version.

-I post the list every month or so to rec.arts.movies. There is no
mailing list.

-Spelling mistakes will be displayed in their full majesty to
hundreds of net readers.

-If the list gets too long, I may edit out some of the boring goofs.

-A book released on this topic is "Film Flubs: Memorable Movie Mistakes" 
by Bill Given. It includes many of the goofs collected here (coincidence?)
and has some nice movie stills.

# About last night
-On new years eve, before Dan and Debbie decide to go out,
they are having a modest dinner with shrimp-looking-things on
the plates.  As the camera angles change, Dan's food is eaten and
uneaten a couple of times.
-When litco is giving dan his first delivery of stolen
(100% off) restaurant supplies in Dan's brand new CITY DINER,
the clock dances wildly in the background as the views change.

# The Abyss
-When Bud brings Lindsey back to the rig after she drowns, she is pulled out 
of the water by the rest of the crew. They clear her hair out of her face. 
In the next scene Hippy puts a tube into her mouth and her hair is back on 
her face again. It's off her face again in the next scene.

# Anatomy of a Murder
-Lee Remick has a skirt when she gets up to leave a cafe. By
the time she gets outside, she's wearing slacks.

# Awakenings 
-There is one scene near the beginning where Robin Williams gets in his car
and talks to his nurse, who is outside the car.  When you look into
the car from the outside, the car window is not quite rolled down,
and when you look out from the car, the car window is completely rolled down.

# Baby Boom
-When Diane Keaton has moved out to her new house and is talking to
her plumber - if you watch the door of the plumber's van during their
conversation, first he closes it, but in a following shot it is open again.

# Back to the Future
-When the Lybian terrorists are chasing Marty around the mall parking lot, 
look at Marty's speedometer. The odometer jumps about 200 miles between 
consecutive shots.
-This one takes place really quick, but when Biff et al.
are chasing Marty (on the "skateboard") their car changes between two
different models.  Watch the headlights!!!  The cutting is rapid and it is
difficult to catch this, even when you're looking for it.

# Backdraft
-When the man in the theatre drops his keys, they are at least 18 inches from
the door.  In the next shot, they are about two inches from the door.

# Bagdad Cafe
-As Jasmine is walking along the deserted road, the shadow of the camera 
and crew in the back of a pickup truck is quite visible. I think this is 
intentional, though, as the cinematographer credit is up during the shot.

# Batman (1989)
-The name of the museum is spelt differently on the outside
and inside of the building.
-In the scene in which Jack Nicholson and his gang deface 
a collection of of paintings, one canvas has pink handprints
on it in one shot but not in a later shot.

# The Battle of Midway
-The same Forestal-class carrier (60's vintage, with slant decks and full 
radar suites) is used as the "Hiryu" and "Soryu", one of which is simply 
the same film turned left-to-right, including the backwards hull number 
painted on the flight deck.

# Better Off Dead
-During the scene of the final ski race down the K-12, when the paper boy 
is chasing Lane, there is an obvious camera on skis in the bottom of the 
shot. I know the skis and the reflection of the camera gear is visible, 
and I think the camera pops in for a minute, too!

# Beverly Hills Cop 
-The more I watch it, the more goofs I find.
Remember the scene where Axel goes to Victor Matlin's office and meets
him for the first time? After a brief conversation, Victor presses a
button to summon his goon squad. They come in to forcibly remove Axel.
Victor's head goon is a thin man with straight hair and glasses. As
the goon squad enters, you see a shot of them looking from Victor's
desk. In this shot, the head goon has his suit jacket buttoned. They
grab Axel, and you see a shot from the door as they carry him out. The
head goon turns around and starts to lead them out. As he does he buttons
his jacket.

# Beverly Hills Cop II 
-There is a scene where Rosewood is driving a large, but slow,
truck(?) and chasing the bad guys.  Eddie Murphy catches 
hold of the door, jumps onto the truck, and gets into the cab.  
Meanwhile, his gun, which he stuck in the back of
his jeans (in the small of his back) can clearly be seen falling out
and into the road.  A little while later he naturally produces this
gun and starts shooting.

# The Big Easy
-In the scene after "Big Daddy" (?) is killed, the position of Ellen 
Barkin's pearl necklace changes depending on whether she is seen from 
the front or the side.

# Bird on a Wire
-In the scene where Mel and Goldie are on the ferry to Wisconsin, they leave
from Detroit (apparently the ferry goes over Michigan!)

# The Black Hole
-The space travellers describe their mission as being to find
"inhabitable life" in the universe, as though we are a race of fleas, looking
for a new dog. They really do say it.

# Blade Runner
-When we first see Roy Batty, he's in a phone box. There's someone's hand on
his shoulder even though he's clearly the only person in the phone box.
(Bob N. sez: "That's Tyrell's hand.  The shot is from them sitting on
his bed near the end of the film, reversed left to right".)
-Yet another `spot the stuntman'. When Zhora goes crashing through those
plate-glass windows, the stunt double looks NOTHING like the actress.
While the actress has wavy reddish hair, the stunt double has this very
curly dark hair. Oops!
-For the scene of the skimmer taking off, the support cables are quite
visible.
-In the Deckard/Batty confrontation, after Deckard has been given
his gun back, and stalk off, you can see (in widescreen versions) the
shadow of the camera man and camera on the wall.

# Blowout
-In the scene where John Travolta crashes through the police barracade
to drive straight through Philly's City Hall they accidentally show the
film crew in an overhead shot swinging their boom around.

# The Blues Brothers
-When the neo-Nazi (played by Henry Gibson) goes off the end of the freeway
in his Pinto, suddenly the view changes and the car is falling from nearly
1000 feet, rather than from about 50 feet. (This may have been done on
purpose to emphasize the comedy, but it's a little jarring to see how
high the Pinto can jump.)

# Body Double
-When Gloria (?) leaves the mall, she hands her parking ticket to the
attendant, and tells him it's a green Mercedes, but it's actually
yellow.

# *******Boom Mikes*************************
It seems that in many movies the microphone that usually presides above
the speaking actor's head can be glimpsed. I think it only fair to 
remember that there is more to be seen vertically in video adaptations
of movies than the editor intended.

All Time Classics:

# Hiding Out
-The boom mike should have top billing for this film, as
it appears more than any of the actors.

# Monty Python's Life Of Brian
-Another boom mike: in the scene where Brian's mother is buying rocks to take
to the stoning, the mike is visible at the top of the screen, SWIVELING back
and forth between the two actors as first one talks, then the other.

-During "Longtime Companion", the well-known death scene where one man is
telling the other to "let go", the overhead mike was visible to me off and
on through the entire scene. I remember it so clearly because I was so
shocked that this very important and emotional scene would have this
occur.  Not only was the mike apparent, but it was moving in and out
of the picture (up and down, like someone couldn't hold it properly),
which was even more of a distraction.

-A classic "boom shot" sequence occurs in the middle of
"Yankee Doodle Dandy".  George M. Cohan (James Cagney) is walking
along a street scene, having a conversation.  The camera is following
him, when the shadow of the boom assembly sweeps across the shot.
Incredibly blatant.

-Hey, what about all those sound booms in 'Out of Africa'?
Made me wonder what kind of African plant has mikes as its fruit. 

-"Night of the Iguana"- Richard Burton actually gets *hit in the head
by a friendly boom mike in one scene...

-"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"- two or three scenes of a black mike
standing out against the white ceiling...

- In `Wall Street' there's a scene where Michael Douglas is walking around 
in Charlie Sheen's apartment giving a speech to Martin Sheen. 
It's dark outside, and the boom mike is clearly visible in the window 
following him around.

#************************************************

# Born on the Fourth of July
-Set in 1968-69 includes Don McLean's American Pie, released in 1971.
-In a protest scene outside the 1972 Republican convention, a
Vietnam veteran is wearing Reeboks, which weren't introduced until
1978.

# The Breakfast Club 
-When the teacher is in the basement looking at the files, the index card 
on the open drawer is in two different positions depending on the angle of 
the camera.

# Bride of Frankenstein
- At the end, when the castle is self-destructing, the good Doctor can 
be seen against the far wall. Yet he is next seen outside in the arms of
his beloved, watching the explosions. There were two endings originally.
The first had Doctor Frankenstein dying within the castle and this was so
filmed. But the producers judged this a bit harsh and wanted a happy ending,
so they shot the extra footage (too expensive to re-film the explosions).
 
# Bullit
-I seem to recall that the Dodge Charger in "Bullit" loses the same hubcap
twice during one of the chase scenes.
-Did everyone else out there know that in the scene in Bullitt where the guy
comes off the motorbike, that the scene wasn't supposed to happen . It seems
that he came off a back road and suddenly came around the corner, but the
scene looked so good that the director left the scene in the movie!!!

# Camelot
-In one scene, Richard Harris is sporting a band-aid on his neck.
-Guinevere's party stops along the way for a cup of tea; tea wasn't
imported to England until much, *much* later.


# Can't Buy Me Love
-Miller and Budweiser must've both paid for product placement in this movie. 
At the New Years Eve party, Ronald, Iris, and John(?) are all holding cans 
of Miller. The camera moves to Bobby, then back to the threesome; now they're 
all holding Budweiser!

# Casablanca
-12 minutes into the film, it is mentioned that the stolen Letters of Transit
are signed by General DeGaulle, and cannot be questioned. But DeGaulle was the
leader of the Free French, and CASABLANCA is set in Vichy France, where he had
been sentenced (in absentia) to death as a traitor. (This is contentious; did
Peter Lorre say "DeGaulle", "Weygand", or a mix of the two?).

# The Cassandra Crossing 
-There is a train that cannot stop, and there is an attempt to pace 
it with a helicopter and lower something down to it on a rope.  
This would be rather a neat trick, because this is
Europe and the train is electric, and every few seconds it passes
under one of the structures holding up the overhead wires!
Solution?  Simple.  In the shot where the attempt is actually made
to lower the rope, the locomotive is magically transformed into a
diesel, and the electric wires are gone!  (And only in that shot;
it's still electric while the helicopter is lining up for the attempt,
and turns back to electric as soon as it's finished.)

# Cleopatra
-She goes thru that arch. Cleopatra died in 30 BC, the arch was
constructed in 300 AD.

# A Clockwork Orange
-Scene where Alex returns to "Home" were he raped the author's wife.
He is eating some spaghetti and drinking some wine, the amount of 
wine in his glass and the amount of spaghetti on his plate jumps
around in an unnatural manner.

# Close Encounters of the Third Kind 
-Richard Dreyfuss is driving a station wagon from his home to the mountain 
that the aliens appear at. The station wagon's license plates switch states.
- During one of the Aliens' visitations to the farm, there's a close of the
little boy Barry watching out the screen door. As the camera zooms in, the
camera shadow becomes apparent on the screen door.

# The Color of Money
-Right after Eddie (Paul Newman) plays Vincent (Tom Cruise), Eddie is seen 
taking apart his cue stick, then the movie cuts to a short time later (after 
the crowd appears to have cleared out some) when Eddie walks over to the table
and AGAIN begins to disassemble his stick.

# Commando
-After Rae Dawn Chong is introduced, Rae gets into her car in the
parking garage. You can see a reflection of the camera and sound man.
-In the chase scene between the bad guys' yellow Porsche and 
the girls' red convertible, the front bumper of the red 
car gets hit and hangs from only one side. A few seconds 
later the bumper is back on the car again all fixed.
-when the Porsche rolls over, it smashes the driver's side. After AS drops the
bad guy over the edge, he rolls the Porsche back upright; the driver's side
is **clearly** smashed badly.  Yet a few seconds later, they show the car
driving off, and there is not a scratch on the driver's side!
-When Arnie is hit by the car as he runs out of the shopping centre,
it is easy to see his wallet fly out of his pocket.
In a later scene, he pulls out his wallet to show Rae Dawn Chong a picture of
his daughter.


# The Crimson Pirate
-(During the balloon scene) the camera pans down from the balloon and onto 
the ship where we see the old crew tied up in the big net. Between the masts 
of the ship you can see a luxury sealiner in the background.

# The Crusades (1935)
-Richard the Lionheart dramatically tosses back his cape ..to check his watch!

# Dances With Wolves
-Early in the film, the first time we see Costner riding Cisco,
there's a canteen tied to Cisco's saddle; as the camera pulls back for a
longer shot, Cisco is prancing along and it becomes obvious that the
canteen is *open*, and there's clearly water splashing all over the side
of the horse.  Score -1 for the prop department.
-Dunbar's wagon driver who carries him to the outpost has some migrating egg
on his face.  In the scene where he is eating the pickled eggs, every shot
from the front of wagon has him with a large piece of egg on his upper lip,
but every time he looks back at Dunbar, its gone.
