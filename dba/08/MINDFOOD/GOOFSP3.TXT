------------------------------------------------------------------
# Handmaid's Tale
-In the scene where Offred is holding yarn for Major's Wife, the amount
of yarn jumps around erratically.
-Natasha is given a photo of her daughter. The camera angles change, and
in the next shot she is holding a _different_ photo. 
-A man is giving a speech denouncing women. He lists one of their sins
as "test-tube babies" (on the soundtrack), but his mouth is clearly
saying something else.

# Hang 'em High
-There's a scene where Clint Eastwood walks into a saloon.
The shadow of the cameraman is clearly visible in the street.

# The Hard Way
-In the captain's office (early in the film, when Jack is complaining
about Nick) a list on the wall is titled "Homocides" (sic).

# Hell Comes to Frogtown 
-(Rowdy Roddy Piper stars as a post-apocalyptic stud whose drafted
by the US government to impregnate virgins in the field ... really
funny !) Roddy shoves a bad-guy demon off a cliff, and the demon falls 
off and out of the picture.  If you play it in slow motion, you can see 
the matress that the demon lands on pop up for a second into the picture.

# Hudson Hawk
- When Hawk gets out of the packing case, he has some styrofoam stuck to his
head.  In a later shot, the position of the styrofoam changes.

# The Hunt for Red October
-A soviet crewman on a US ship does a sign of the (Roman Catholic) cross 
when the Russian sub goes down. Russian orthodoxists should do a mirror-image
cross (ie. head, heart, right, left)!

# Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
-(In the scene at the beginning) Indy is swinging off the Coronado via 
a hook on a line.  He distinctly has the Cross of Coronado in his left hand 
in the previous scene.  When he grabs onto the hook, the cross disappears, 
and when he lands in the water, it's in his left hand again.
-The first shot of the adult Indy as he raises his head shows blood trickling
down his chin from one side of his mouth.  In the next and subsequent shots,
the blood is dripping from the other side.
-In trying to find his father. Indiana Jones goes thru his father's mail.
A close up of the letters shows one with a stamp not issued by the U.S.
Post Office until after the time frame of the movie.
-After being chased by the Germans, Indy and his father come to a sign that
is posted by a fork in the road. One road goes to Berlin, the other to Venice.
This sign is unlikely, because Venice and Berlin are roughly 400 miles apart.
-In the sequence in which Indy's clambering about on the outside of the tank,
it's impossible for him to have gotten hung up on the gun barrel the way he 
does -- the end of the barrel's already been blown apart, causing it to 
blossom like a metal flower which is too large for Indy to have passed that 
loop of equipment strap over even if he'd wanted to.
-After the tank goes over the cliff, the turret of the tank falls off and away
as the tank hits the ground. However, when Connery and the rest look over the
edge at the tank, the turret is in place on the top of the tank.
-As the camera angles change on Sean Connery right after the Hatayan tank
falls from the cliff, you can see marked differences in the way Connery's
beard is trimmed.
-While spelling out the word of God, Indy steps on a letter, accidentally
breaking the letter behind his foot.  In the next scene, the letter is intact.

# Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
-When the rope bridge is cut and Indy is climbing up, the 'bad guys' start 
shooting arrows at him from across the canyon. Now, several of these 
actually hit Indy in the back...and harmlessly bounce off.
-In the finale when the kids are returning to their mothers, one kid is
boosted up to his mother. You can see the assistant's white hands for a 
second helping the kid up to the mother.

# Intolerance [1916] 
-Shot includes director's assistant clad in coat and tie in scene set
in ancient Babylon.

# Jagged Edge
-Glenn Close's outfit changes from gray to blue to brown to blue in a
a courtroom sequence (..or was this to convey the passage of a 
few days? Anyone?).

# Jailhouse Rock
-The prison number on Elvis's jacket changes from 6239 to 6240.

# The Jewel of the Nile
-Kathleen Turner jumps onto a train wearing canvas slip-on that
change to leather sandals that change back to canvas shoe later
in the scene.

# Julius Caesar 
-In the scene where Cassius offers Brutus his dagger to kill him,
the blade of his dagger falls off as he pulls it out of the sheath.
Without even slowing down, the actor offers the hilt of the dagger to Brutus,
with the "blade" hidden behind his forearm.  Truly a great recovery...

# Kelly's Heroes
-While they are removing the "boxes of gold bars" from the bank, some
of the actors act as if the boxes are very heavy, while others toss them
around as if they are empty (which they were).
-Each box is supposed to carry 12 gold bars, each of 10 kg -- that's
over 240 lbs a box -- at the very end, Kelly (Clint Eastwood) picks up
two boxes, one in each hand, and hauls them out. A real man's man :-)

# The King and I
-During Yul Brynner's "Is a Puzzlement" number, the earring he
wears in some shots is absent in others.  It also shifts from
ear to ear.

# Knock on Wood
-A policeman dashes up the stairs wearing a helmet...and busts into
the room wearing a peaked cap.

# Krakatoa, East of Java
-It's west of Java.

# Lethal Weapon:
-When Roger is complaining about his life being over and xxx years on the
force and not a scratch on his record, the car he's driving is moving 
but the shifter is in park.
-Riggs handcuffs himself to the depressed businessman. They jump off the
building but they're not handcuffed to each other anymore.

# Look Who's Talking
-While John Travolta and Kristie Alley drive around in search of a 
missing child, Travolta has sunglasses on in the shots taken from
outside the car but not those taken inside.

# The Lost Boys
-There is a scene where actor Jason Patric is flying uncontrollably in 
his room.  In his scramble to control himself, he accidentally knocks 
his phone off the hook.  This is quite clear.  We then
cut to the next room, where the phone rings.  Corey Haim picks it up, 
and begins to talk...only to have Patric talk on his phone.  Of course, my
question is how could the phone ring?  Wouldn't it have been a busy signal?
-There are two or three scenes where the camera simulates the vampires
flying into and out of their lair.  One of the scenes is clearly just
the previous one played backwards (as the camera flies over the ocean 
the waves head *OUT* to sea)

# The Maltese Falcon:
-There's a fire on a boat (La Paloma) in the port of San Francisco.
The fire fighters have Los Angeles Fire Department uniforms on.
What a long drive to put out a fire!!!

# Manhunter
- when the second police car crashes into the ditch, the driver cracks his
head on the windscreen (complete with sound effects).  In slow motion, it is
obvious that the windscreen was smashed, and then the stuntman threw his
head against it.

# Marked for death
-There is a scene where Stevan Segal is sitting in a truck parked next to the 
curb, watching some bad guys in a black four-door.  The street is covered 
with leaves. Later when he starts up the truck and drives toward the bad guys 
car the street is clean with barely any leaves on it.

# Meet Me in St. Louis
-While Judy Garland sings "The Trolley Song" a friend visiting the set 
shouts "Hiya Judy!" and we see her react to it. Her character's name is Rose.
-In some early scene you can see that there is feather/down snow
floating all over the set, left over from the upcoming winter scenes.

# Memphis Belle
-In the opening minutes of the film, a B17 is returning to its British base 
after a mission and attempts a crash landing, siding over the camera placement
During this shot, look at the engines on the port side of the plane (right 
side of the screen): the inboard engine has two of three blades remaining and 
there is only one left on the outboard engine. But when the plane finally 
slides to a stop, the propeller blades have miraculously reappeared.

# Mermaids
-Bob Hoskins discusses how "AstroTurf" will ruin baseball.  
Movie is set in 1963, AstroTurf was not introduced until 1967 or so. 

# Midnight Express
-There is a shot of one of the walls to the prison, from the outside.  
There is a path that starts at the lower left of the wall and goes 
to the right, climbing.  Along the bottom of the wall there are a 
few scraggly trees.  Now, the protagonist (or someone) 
goes running up the path, from left to right.  Your attention is
meant to be focused on him, but if you watch the bottom of the screen, you
will see the boomman running in time with the actor, sticking his
microphone in the general direction of the action.  It is plain as day.
-In the scene where Hayes is alone(?) in that "wheel room", I recall the
boom mike being PLAINLY visible. This is not one of those times where
it simply "dips" down from above. In this scene, you can see the entire
rig.

# Narrow Margin
-There's a chase scene in the early part of the movie through a Canadian
wood. Their vehicle hits a low branch and it thoroughly cracks the upper
half of the windshield. Towards the end of the chase, for one shot, the
windshield is miraculously gone! and then reappears for the next shot...

# The Natural
At the end before Roy Hobbs hits the home run, look how the blood pattern
on his uniform changes from shot to shot. It gets bigger and smaller and
the number of spots changes.
When he is in his slump, he goes to Wrigley and it is supposed to be the
first inning when he bats the first time. However, the scoreboard shows
the Cubs up 1-0. They would not have batted yet since it is at Wrigley. Then
in the ninth when he hits the home run  and breaks the clock; everybody
acts like they are leaving but why don't the Cubs bat in the bottom of ninth.
 
# Never Say Never Again (James Bond) 
-There is a scene where Bond and Felix swim across to have a look at 
the villain's yacht - when Bond first gets into the water he has no 
head mask with his scuba diving suit, but when he exits, he is seen 
taking it off - guess somebody forgot about Connery's toupee.......

# The Never Ending Story 
-Atreyu is washed up on a beach, face down.  He raises his head, looks around,
 then stands up.  During this movement, there is a cut from a tight to a wide 
 shot. In the tight shot, Atreyu's chest is covered with sand.  In the wide 
 shot his chest is clean.
-Hathaway has just left Rockbiter. We see him (from above) walking towards
 that building on top of the hill. All around him there are the remains
 of the devastated city. On his right there are some rocks strewn about.
 Suddenly the ground opens up. The camera switches to a ground-level
 shot. On his right there is now a "wall" of rocks (extending way up into
 the air). The camera now switches back to an aerial shot. The wall is
 gone and the "strewn about" rocks are back. Looks like the matte painters
 and set designers didn't agree on this one.
-(38:19 into the movie)
 You can play "spot the stuntman" with this scene. If you can single-
 frame the film, go about 9 frames in to this "second", and there is a
 full-face image of the stuntman just before he falls from the tree.
-Watch the bottom of the asteroid flying by. Its support pole apparently
 gets in the way as the asteroid rotates and ends up "masking" a vertical
 section of the asteroid. Looks like the effects department goofed up this
 time.

# Nightmare on Elm Street
-Nancy, after talking to her father, is seen walking past a tree, and
in her hand is what seems to be the exact same tickets that her boyfriend 
gives her in the next scene!!!

# Ninja III (The Domination)
-At one point, the ninja is standing on top of a police car.  He then stabs
on policeman through the top of the car and punches the other, also through
the top of the car.  This makes two large holes in the roof which magicaly
no longer there in the next shot when the car goes into a lake.

# North and South
-In one battle scene, the camera pans across the battle field... and
gets a shot of another camera filming away.

# North by Northwest 
-Cary Grant complains that he only has one suit for his stay in
Chicago. Yet when he heads out into the prairie, he has a different
colour suit on.
-There is a scene in a cafe where Cary Grant is approached by Eva Marie Saint.
They talk and she draws a gun and shoots him. Before she does however 
there is a shot of a crowd scene. Included is a little boy, who was 
obviously at the scene rehearsal, putting his fingers in his ears.
-Many backdrop tops and light reflections.

# An Officer and a Gentlman
-In the fight at the end of the film, Lou Gosset throws a punch that Richard 
Gere blocks. Gere then grabs Gosset's arm.  If you single step this scene, you
can see that in one shot, Gere is holding Gosset by the wrist, and in the next
frame (from a different angle) he is holding him near his elbow.

# One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
-As Jack Nicholson is strangling Nurse Ratchet, his cap falls off and 
is surprisingly back on his head seconds later.

# Operation Petticoat
-At the end of the movie, as Cary Grant is coming off the gangplank from the 
submarine, Tony Curtis's character's kids actually call him Mr. Grant rather 
than Admiral Whatever.

# Outland
-Sean Connery is involved in one of those fights where they are outside
with spacesuits on. As he is struggling, you can CLEARLY see his bare
arm where the sleeve of the spacesuit is supposed to be attached to
the glove. Considering the way people are blowing up whenever they are
exposed to space elsewhere in the film, this probably wasn't intended.
-At one point Connery gets a bad guy cornered and "interrogates" him
with his custom shotgun. Both men are approx. 4 meters apart and still
Sean manages to miss the baddie twice. Some special non-expanding ammo?

# Pacific Heights
-Melanie Griffiths is sneaking around Michael Keaton's room. We see his
open briefcase on the table. The next scene shows Melanie sitting at
the table and opening the (inexplicably closed) briefcase.

# Parenthood 
-During the scene where Jason Robards talks to his
wayward son in the garage in front of his prized green car, the entire
film crew is visible in the reflection of the car.
-The horse that the kids ride is a docile looking, skinny
chestnut colored horse.  Then Steve Martin gets on the horse
an rides him down the street and attempts to jump him over a
hedge - the horse is now bay coloured, and with a lot more energy..

# Pee Wee's Big Adventure
-When Pee Wee is chaining his BIKE up next to the clown (outside the bike-
store), he opens up a small "basket" on his bike to pull out the chain. Of
course, he pulls out about 75 feet of chain, so what is desired is that old
"joke" about something very large fitting in something very small. However
one thing spoils it... in the "wide view" shot, it is clearly seen that the
"basket" has a hole in it. Looking at the bottom-right of the screen, one can
see the chain going up through the hole in the basket, through the basket and
being pulled by PW...

# The Perfect Weapon
-When Jeff is listening to the song 'The Power', the radio station
identifies itself as "FM 109". (FM dials only go as high as 108).

# Pet Sematary
-While daddy Dale Midkeff kneels by his son's grave, the nearby
flowers change from purple to yellow.

# Plan 9 from Outer Space
-The grass wrinkles.
-Day changes to night and back and forth in the same scene, many times.
-Bela Lugosi appears in only a few shots (he died early in production)
and in all other shots his character is played by a taller man with
his arm in front of his face.

# Porky's II 
-Set in the 50's, the movie poster showed a cheerleader wearing
Nikes. Don't know if this reoccurs in the movie.

# Presumed Innocent
-Check out the tape recorder shoved into ???'s face (Can't remember who,
I was so blown away by it) after ??? emerges from the courthouse making
a few statements to the press. The tape recorder is an obvious "prop" that
nobody thought to put a tape in. I about cracked up watching him talk into
an empty tape recorder.

# Pretty Woman
-On the movie poster, Gere's hair is brown. In the movie it's grey. 
-While they are having breakfast - watch the donut/roll/pancake Julia Roberts 
is eating - it keeps switching -very bad editing!
-In the scene where Gere and Roberts are dining with Ralph Bellamy,
the meals they have in front of them (esp. the sorbets) chop 'n change.
-Julia Roberts starts undressing Richard Gere, Gere's tie and collar
go from being untied and unbuttoned to being tied and buttoned, then
back again, all in a matter of seconds.
-Also, Julia takes off his shoes and socks. A few seconds later they
are magically back on his feet again.
