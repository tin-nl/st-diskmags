A TALK IN THE PARK
==========================================================================

A PARK
======

Four park benches, seperated but not too distant from each other. On
one sits Beryl, a belligerent young girl at present engrossed in 
reading a long letter. On another sits Charles who looks what he is,
a business man dressed for the weekend. he is slowly thumping his way
through a thick report. On another sits Doreen, middle-aged, untidily
dressed, feeding the birds from a bag of breadcrumbs. On the remaining
bench sits Ernest, a younger man. He sits gazing into space, The
birds sing. After a moment, Arthur enters. he is a bird-like man
in a long mackintosh, obviously on the look-out for company. 
Eventually, he approaches Beryl's bench...........


ARTHUR: Is this seat occupied, by any chance?
BERYL:  (shortly) No (she continues to read)
ARTHUR: Great, great (he sits)

A pause. Arthur takes deep breaths and gives a few furtives glances
in Beryl's direction

        student, i see?

BERYL:   What? 
ARTHUR:  Student, i bet. You look like a student. Always tell a student.
BERYL:   No
ARTHUR:  Ah, you look like one. You're young enough to be a student.
         quite young enough. That's the life, isn't it? Being a student. 
         Not a care in the world, Sitting in the park on a day like
         this. In the sunshine. Rare enough we see the sun, eh? Eh? Rare.
BERYL:   Yes (she refuses to be drawn into conversations)
ARTHUR:  Mind you, i shouldn't be here. By rights, i should be at home.
         That's where i should be, Inside my front door. I've got 
         plenty of things I should be doing. The kitchen shelves to
         name but three. Only you sit at home on a day like today.
         Sunday. Nothing to do. On your own- you think to yourself.
         You know what they say about people who talk to themselves?
         Eh? Eh? Yes. So i thought it's outdoors for you, else they'll
         come and take you away. Mind you, i'm never at a loss. I'm a
         fulfilled person. I have, for example, one of the biggest 
         collections of sigarette cards of anyone alive or dead that
         i know of. And you don't get that by sitting on your
         behind all day. But i'll let you into a secret. Do you know
         what it is that's the most valuable thing there is you can
         hope to collect? People i' m a collector of people. I look
         at them i observe them, i hear them talk. i listen to 
         their manner of speaking and i think, hallo, her's another one.
         Different, Different again. Because i'll let you into a secret
         They are like fingerprints. They are never quite the same.
         And i've met a number in my lifetime. Quite a number. Some
         good, some bad, all different. But the best of them and 
         i'm saying this to you quite frankly and openly, the best of
         them are women. They are superior people. They are better
         people. They are cleaner people. They are kinder-hearted
         people. If i had a choice. i'd be a woman. Now that makes you
         laugh, i expect, but it's the truth. When i choose to have
         a conversation, i can tell you it's with a woman every time.
         Because a woman is one of nature's listeners. Most men i wouldn't 
         give the time of day to. Now i expect that shocks you but it's
         the truth. Trouble is i don't get to meet as many women as
         i'd like to. My particular line of work does not bring me into
         contact with them as much as i would wish. Which is a pity.
         

        Beryl get's up               ~bench.bl2~   
 


BERYL:   Excuse me. (she moves off)
ARTHUR:  Are you going?
          

         Beryl moves to Charles's bench


BERYL: (to Charles) Excuse me, is this seat taken?
CHARLES: (barely glancing up) No (he moves along his bench)
BERYL: (sitting) Thanks. Sorry, only the man over there won't stop
       talking. I wanted to read this in peace. I couldn't concentrate,
       He just kept going on and on about his collections or something.
       I normally don't mind too much, only if you get a letter like
       this, you need all your concentration. You can't have people
       talking in your ear-especially when you're trying to decipher
       writing like this. He must have been stoned out of his mind
       when he wrote it. It wouldn't be unusual. Look at it. He wants
       me to come back. Some hopes. To him. He's sorry, he didn't mean
       to do what he did, he won't do it again i promise, etc. etc.
       I seem to have heard that before. It's not the first time i can 
       tell you. And there's no excuse for it, is there? Violence. I mean
       what am i supposed to do? Keep going back to that? Every time
       he loses his temper he ...... i mean, there's no excuse. A fracture, 
       you know. It was nearly a compoud fracture. That's what they told me.
       (indicating her head) Right here. You can practically see it to
       this day. Two X-rays. I said to him when i got home, i said, 
       You bastard, you know what you did to my head?" He just stands there, 
       the way he does. "Sorry," he says, I am ever so sorry." I told him.
       I said "You're a bastard" that's what you are. A right, 
       uncontrolled, violent, bad tempered bastard". You know what he said?
       He says, "You call me a bastard again and and i'll smash your
       stupid face in". That what's he says. I mean, you can't have
       a rational, civilized discussion with a man like that, can you?
       He's a  right bastard. My friend Jenny, she says, You're
       a looney, leave him for God's sake. You're a looney". Who needs
       that? You tell me one person who needs that? Only where do you 
       go? I mean, there's all my things- my personal things. All
       my- everything. He's even got my bloody Post Office Book.
       I'll finish up back there, you wait and see. I must be out of my
       tiny mind. Eh. Sometimes i just want to jump down a deep hole
       and forget it. Only i know that bastard'll be waiting at the
       bottom. Waiting to thumb the life out of me. Eh?

CHARLES: Yes excuse me. (he gets up)
BERYL:   I'm sorry, i didn't mean to embarrass you
CHARLES: No, no  
BERYL:   I just had to...
CHARLES: Quite all right. quite all right.

        Charles moves over to Doreen

(to Doreen) Nobody here, is there?
         
DOREEN:  What?
CHARLES: Nobody here?
DOREEN:  Nobody where? (she looks round)
CHARLES: Sitting here
DOREEN:  NO, NO
CHARLES: Sorry, Do you mind if you i do? (he sits) I won't disturb you.
         Girl over there's got boy friend trouble. Comes and pours
         it all out on me- as if i'am interested. I mean, we've all
         got troubles no doubt. But we all don't sit on a bench and
         bore innocent strangers to death. I mean, that in my book
         spells S for selfishness. And have you through it. Can't
         imagine that perhaps we were young, too. Don't know where
         they think we all came from. I mean, five years ago i had a
         house in the country, a charming wife, two good children,
         couldn't imagine a happier family. My wife dies suddenly,
         my children, can't stand the place a moment longer and
         emigrate to Canada so i sell the house and there i am in a
         flat i can hardly swing a cat in. But i don't go round boring 
         other people with it. That's life. I've had twenty- no more 
         like twenty-five, good years. Who am i to complain if i get  
         a few bad ones throw in as well. Make no mistake, i know  
         i am in for some bad ones. Things are going to get worse 
         before they get better. Bound to. And you know an interesting
         thing about trouble? I always think it's a bit like
         woodworm. Once. You've got a dose, if you're not careful. it
         starts to spread. Starts in your family and, before you know
         it, it's into your business. Which explains why i'm sitting
         here reading a report that's been put together so badly that
         i've got to read it through on my one day off and condense
         it into another report before i can even be certain whether
         i' m bankrupt. I mean, i don't know if you're interested but
         just take a look at this page here, this is a typical page.
         Can you make head or tail...

        Doreen gets up and moves away

        (muttering) Oh, i beg your pardon

        Doreen moves to Ernest's bench

                     
DOREEN:  Excuse me
ERNEST:  Eh?
DOREEN:  Excuse me. may i sit here for a moment? (she sits) The man over
         there has been -you know-  i didn't want to make a scene but he-
         you know. I mean, i suppose i should call the police- but they'd
         never catch him. I mean, most of the police are men as well,
         aren't they? Between you and me, i have heard that most of the
         police women are as well. Men dressed up, you know. Special
         Duties, so called. So my ex-husband informed me. I mean, it's
         terrible, you can't sit in a park these days without some
         men-you know-i mean, i am on a fixed income-i don't want all
         that. That comes from my husband. My ex- husband. He runs a pub.
         In the country. But i had to leave him. We got to the stage
         when it was either that or-you know-. I love dogs, you see, but
         he would never- he refused, point blank. And the day came
         when i knew i must have my dog here with me only he's at the
         vet's. He's only a puppy. They had to kep him in.
         He's being-you know-poor little thing. He'd have seen that man
         off. He's a loyal little dog. He understands every word i say
         to him. Every word i said to him this morning. Ginger-boy,
         i said-you're coming down to the vet's with me this morning
         to be-you know, and this little ears pricked up and this
         tails wagged. He knew, you see. I think dogs are more
         intelligent than people. They are much better company and
         the wonderful thing is that once you've got a little dog,
         you meet other people with dogs. And what i always say is that
         people who have dogs they're the nicest sort of people. They
         are the ones i know i'd get on with.

        Ernest gets up

        Have you got a dog, by any change?

        Ernest ignores her and creeps behind the trees to Arthur

        ERNEST: (sitting down next to Arthur) Exuse me, Just taking
        refuge. Nut case over there. Bloody woman prattling on about
        her dog. Ought to be locked up. Thinks every man's after her.
        I mean look. Look at it. After her? She'd have to pay'em. You
        know the sort though, don't you? I mean, if you let her talk
        to you long enough, she'll talk herself into thinking
        you've assaulted her. Before you know it, she's screaming
        blue murder, you'll be carried off by the fuzz and that's
        your lot. Two years if you're lucky. I mean, i came out here
        just to get away from the wife. Don't want another one just
        like her, do i? I mean. That's why i am in the park. Get
        away from the noise. You got kids? Don't have kids. Take my
        tip, don't get married. Well, looks all right, but believe
        me-nothing's your own. You've paid for it all but nothing's
        your own. Yap, yap, yap. Want, want, want. Never satisfied.
        I mean, no word of a lie. I look at her some mornings and i
        think, blimey, i must have won last prize in a raffle. Mind
        you, i dare say she's thinking the same. In fact. I know
        she is. Certainly keeps me at a distance. Hallo, dear, put
        your money on the table and she's off out. Don't see her for
        dust. Sunday mornings, it's a race to see who can get out
        first. Loser keeps the baby. Well, this morning i made it
        first. Here i am in the quiet. Got away from the noise,
        You know something interesting? Most of our lives are noise,
        aren't they? Artificial man-made noise. But you sit out here
        and you can listen-and-well, there's a bit of traffic but 
        appart from that-peace. Like my mother used to say. Shut your
        eyes in the country and you can hear God breathing (he shuts
        his eyes)

ARTHUR: (leaning across to Beryl) Hey-hey-pssst! I've got a right one
        here. Thinks he's listening to God breathing... (he laughs)
BERYL:  (leaning across to Charles) He's talking again. To me. What
        do you do? (she smiles)
CHARLES:(leaning across to Doreen) There she goes again. What did i tell
        you? Chapter two of the boyfriend saga.
DOREEN: (leaning across to Ernest) He's talking to me. If he does
        it any more, i'll call the police...
ERNEST: (to Arthur) Oh, blimey. Why doesn't she go home? Hark at her.
        Can you hear her? Rabbitting on...

        The following, final section, played as a Round. Doreen 
        finishes first, then Charles cuts out, followed by Beryl,
        Arthur, and then Ernest

ARTHUR: (to Beryl) Hey-hey...

        Beryl continues to ignore him

        Oh, suit yourself

BERYL:   (to Charles) Psst-psst...
        
        Charles ignores her

        Oh, be like that

CHARLES: (to Doreen) I say, i say...

        Doreen ignores him
        
        Oh, all right, don't then...
     
DOREEN: (to Ernest) Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me

        Ernest ignores her 

        Oh, really

ERNEST:  (nudging Arthur) Oy-oy...

        Arthur ignores him 

        Oh, all right, then, Don't then, Might as well talk to yourself
    
        They all sit sulkily. The Lights fade to a Black-out, and-


        the Curtain falls
