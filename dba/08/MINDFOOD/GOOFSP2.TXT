------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Darkman
-(near the beginning) Darkman and Julie are on the bed & Julie is using the 
cordless phone. After she hangs up and puts the phone back down, it is 
facing down. The next scene shows the phone facing up.

# Days of Thunder
-When Tom Cruise is injured during a race, he's taken to hospital with a
red ring around the iris of his right eye. But in the subsequent scenes at
the hospital, the ring moves to his left eye and then back to his right.

# Decameron Nights
-As Louis Jourdan surveys the shore from his 14th century ship, you
can clearly see a large white truck winding its way down a hill.

# Diamonds are Forever (James Bond) 
-There is a chase scene between Bond in a "moon buggy" and a bunch of Fords 
careening across the desert. In one shot, one of the Fords shoots over 
a sand dune. In the lower corner of the screen, you see what appears to be 
one of the moon buggy's wheels bouncing away. Next shot, the moon buggy 
drives away, with all wheels intact.
-At one point James Bond is driving a car down an alley that ends at a gap 
between two buildings that is too narrow to drive through normally.  Somehow, 
Bond manages to get the two left wheels up in the air and drives through the
gap at a slant. When the car comes out from between the two buildings, the 
two RIGHT wheels are in the air. (The intervening sequence, where the car
rides on all 4 wheels again before lifting the two right wheels, was edited
out of the TV version of this movie).

# Die Hard
-Watch the window on the door to the conference room where Hans kills Takagi. 
Takagi's brains splatter all over the glass. But in the next scene the amount 
of blood on the glass is a lot less.  Later during the shootout in the same
room the amount of blood that was originally on the glass reappears.

# Die Hard II
-Pacific Bell phones in Dulles Airport.
-Many characters say that Dulles airport is in Washington D.C. It is
actually in Virginia. (?!)
-Later in the movie, Bruce Willis is shown running through the airport 
terminal.  In the background, you see him running past one of the 
information boards near the baggage claim and rental car area. It shows 
a map of the *Los Angeles* freeway system.

# Disorganized Crime
-Two FBI agents have their car stolen by a group of bank robbers. 
The car is used by both sides in several chase scenes, and they keep 
referring to it as a "Chrysler", even though it's a Ford. I wonder if they 
took product-placement money from both companies?

# Do the Right Thing
-The "mayor" of the street gives the old woman (Ruby Dee?) a bouquet of red
flowers.  The next day she is shown with the flowers, but they have changed.  
I think they switched between carnations and roses.

# Driving Miss Daisy
-Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman's encounter with state troopers clearly 
takes place in Alabama. The troopers, however, wear Georgia Patches on 
their uniforms.

# Dr. Strangelove
-You see the B-52 flying (obviously a model) over the arctic landscape and
below you can plainly see the shadow of the prop-driven plane (a B-17) from 
which the snowscape shots were filmed.

# E.T.
-Did anyone else notice in E.T. that for about one second, you see Elliot 
wreck his bike?  He has E.T. in the front and everything.  It flashed really 
quick, and most people didn't see it.  I only saw it the second time I saw it 
because a friend had noticed it the time before, so I was looking.  The guy I 
was with didn't catch it though.
-When Eliot first sees ET in the storage shed, watch him and the boy
sitting next to him at the table after he runs in to tell his 
brother's friends.  As he's telling them of his amazing discovery,
the boy next to him is mouthing the lines along with Eliot.

# Emma Hamilton
-Set in 1804, the film features the chimes of Big Ben... 50 years
before it was built.

# The Empire Strikes Back
-In the scene where Han Solo is about to get carbon-frozen, the close-ups
show him without his vest, then with his vest, then without his vest as he
goes down...
-The scene where Luke is on the ground in the snow... when all the AT_ATs
are moving in, he turns his head out of sync with a 'plane' flying overhead 
that he sees.. Every time I see it I notice it..

# Excalibur
-King Arthur sure looks spiffy in his shiny silver armor. As a matter of
fact, it's so shiny that in it you can see the reflection of someone
holding what appears to be a boom microphone. Considering that Arthur
is having a private chat with Guenevere, it is safe to say that the
"boom guy" *ISN'T* supposed to be there.

# Fatal Attraction
-Glen Close is in bed, talking to Michael Douglas, who's standing.
In the shots looking at her from the viewer's left (her right), the sheet
is below her (visible) breasts. In the shot looking at her from the
viewer's right, the sheet is over her breasts.

# La Femme Nikita
-Nikita is in Venice when she is called upon to perform an assassination.  
The window in the bathroom won't open, so she uses a towel to protect her 
hand as she punches a hole in it. But after she shoots her target, you
can see the window in the background, complete and unbroken.


# Flatliners
-During the final resuscitation scene, the hand-held camera is
easily seen in the reflection of the EEG monitor when it zooms in.

# Fletch:
-Doctor Rosenpenis's stethoscope, VERY BRIEFLY, appears off, then back on 
his ears as he is bending over to pick up the papers he has dropped.

# 48 Hours
-There is a black, dusty Porsche that Eddie drives
around in late in the movie, but you can see that car early in
the movie while traipsing around the city.  Pretty lousy
garage to let the car out without washing or without a ticket.

# Frankenhooker
-It is the scene just after the doctor wakes up in his garage/laboratory,
finds the "monster" is gone, and runs out to the street.
>From the street, the camera shows the doctor comming out of the 
garage.  His car is in front of his house on the street.  Then the camera 
follows him as he runs a little way up the street looking for the monster.
It is late at night and the streets are empty of people.  
There is another car on the street not far in front of the doctor's car.
The doctor then runs back to his car, jumps in, and drives off.  But ...
THE CAR DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIS IS NOW GONE.
The whole scene is just a few seconds. The strange thing about this goof is 
that the scene is (apparently), continuous.  I could not see break in the 
action where they could have moved the car.  Its as if the movie makers did 
it just as a joke of somekind.

# Full Metal Jacket
-In the first half of the film, the soldiers have to go across one of those
monkey-bar-type things that you hang from and get across by moving one hand
alternately ahead of the other. The sergeant in charge shouts "It should take 
no less than x seconds to get across!"  But this doesn't make sense. He should
have said "it should take no *more* than"....because then he'd be putting a 
reasonable upper limit on it.

# Gargoyles 
-There is a scene where a cops car in speeding down a dirt road. The 
car changes from a Chevy Impala to a Ford several times during the 
scene.

# Ghost
-In the scene where Demi and Pat are making pottery in the middle of
the night, they both cover their hands in wet clay. Before you know
it they're bumping and grinding and running their hands through each 
other's hair - and their hands are clean!
-When bad guy Rick Aviles is hit and killed by a car, his body is left
lying in the street. Seconds later, when his ghost appears at the scene,
his dead body is lying on top of the car. [Roger W. said that the
*ghost* was left on the ground, and the *body* on the car bonnet. Can
someone please check this on video?]

# Ghostbusters
-During the scene on top of the apartment building, there are rocks
falling from the top of the building.  At one point, the scene cuts to a shot
of the panicking crowd in the street.  Watch closely - you can see one of the
rocks hit a wooden police barricade - and BOUNCE OFF!
-You can also see marshmallow on a truck *before* Mr StaPuft gets fried.

# Gleaming The Cube
-During the big chase sequence at the end, the burgundy Toronado 
alternately has and doesn't have headlight covers.
-Later during this same chase, the stolen police car cuts in front of 
a red Corvette, "damaging" the left front fender near the headlight. 
When Christian Slater skates up alongside the irate driver the "damage"
to the car is obviously from *old* rust, and not a hit from another car.

# Glory
-In the first scene where Morgan Freeman meets Matthew Broderick, Freeman is
is kicking soldiers to see if they are alive. When Broderick looks up to see 
who has kicked him, the sun is clearly shining from behind him. Yet in the 
next scene, Freeman comes into the sunlight, showing his face. The sun is 
behind him now. The direction of the sun alternates in the next two scenes.
- One has to look real close at the night battle scenes at the end to discern 
that the bayonets are rubber (they wiggle). This was actually a safety
precaution so that no one got skewered in the dark.

# Godfather III
-In the montage of newspaper clippings describing the Corleone family's 
involvement with the Italian corporation, all of the headlines are correct
(e.g. CORLEONE GAINS STOCK IN IMMOBILIARE), but the text underneath them is 
way off base: one story talks about Saddam Hussein, another is about something
else in current affairs (taxes? I forgot), and the third is actually from a 
computer manual, as I recall seeing "Insert the disk into the drive and
turn the computer on" before it flashed offscreen. 

# Gone With the Wind
-When the horse-drawn carriages are driving up to Twelve Oaks, 
they cast no shadows on the ground.
-When Scarlett and Melanie are nursing the wounded soldier, their
shadows don't fit their movements.
-Late in the second half, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) takes the women on
a wild "chariot style" ride through burning Atlanta. Depending on which cut of
the film you see, Rhett changes once, twice, or three times into a short black
stunt man while driving the wagon!!

# Goodfellas  
-In the scene near the end where DeNiro's character is trying to off
the wife (by telling her to go into the "dress shop"), she speeds off
in her car, and in the process, blows a fake license plate off the
car parked in front of her (an orange new york license plate covering
a new one).

# The Graduate
-Ben, in a pretty establishing shot, drives over the Bay Bridge to 
Berkeley and is on the upper span, thus going the wrong way.

# Green Berets
-John Wayne goes eastward into the sunset

# Green Card
-Andie MacDowell goes to the dinner party at her friend's parents' house.
In the scene out in the garden when she is talking to the father
she is barelegged; later when she comes home we see her taking off 
black stockings.

# Gremlins
-Zach Galligan's Volkswagen changes color twice in the course
of a few minutes.
-The *underside* of tree branches are coated with snow.
-Look at the scene when the gremlins are swinging from the Christmas tree and 
the tree falls forward.  For a split second, you can see a prop man pushing 
the tree over.  He's behind the tree a little to the left, and he's wearing a 
red shirt and glasses. 

# Halloween
-Although the story takes place in Illinois, all the cars have
California license plates.

# Hamlet (Zefferelli)
-When the guy is stabbed through the curtain, the size and position of the
hole in the curtain changes.
