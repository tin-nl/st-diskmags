MODULES IN GFA

Modules in GFA,

You must be out of your mind. Well yes everybody knows that a lot of
GFA freaks try to get the very best out of the GFA language. But this
nice trick couldn't do without a nice piece of 68000 language, it's just
to complex.

So what is it ???? Well we all know the latest music kind, the MODULE
files. They are so much better the the silly old Yamaha chip music's
and you have 4 channels to play. There are just one ore two small
dificulties. The mod files are most of the time big, say about 80 Kb,
and they take a lot more cpu time.

In 100% GFA basic it's not possible to play the modules so Jedi of Sector
One from The Heavy Killers made a Sound tracker player in ASM for you to
use in GFA..It takes about 22% of the VBL at 10.1 KHz and still leave some
registers. There is just one small thing you have to know: The four voices
--> MUST <-- start at the same time if you want to avoid lotsa nasty
noises.  So take Audio Sculpture of (Pro)-Tracker and put an (new) unused
instrument at the first line of the first position of the module...

This small very nice routine works nice on a normal St or even an STE. 
The Atari TT isn't supported it just doesn't seem to work. So get started
and let us see some of those nice GFA demo's with good musix/mod's under
it. We are waiting...
