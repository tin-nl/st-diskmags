11:38  We have stopped the article here, a lot of groups have left the party
       already.
       It was great fun and we like to thank all the people who wrote a 
       piece in this mega-big realtime article.
       Also thanks to the organisation for doing this cool party, we all had
       a good time .....

       This article was made real time and we didn't edit or change
       anything in it so there maybe some insults or offending words
       in it. But we didn't want to change anything in it so you just
       have to read over them if you don't like it !
 
       And remember the dutch scene rulezzzz.....
