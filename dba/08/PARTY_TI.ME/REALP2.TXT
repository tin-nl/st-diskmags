REALTIME PART 2

22:09   Hello, here's Corsair again. I like to make a note to the Bremen's
        banks. They are totally SHIT! I can't get any money out of the 
        fucking automats!!!! Jesus, please do something about that. With-
        out money I'm a poor beggar here.

22:11   Yooo fuck, I just lost all my lifes on the fuckin` NEO GEO.
        What a shit machine. It isn`t slow enough for my brain!!!!!

22:44   Yeah, just a quick messy. We just arrived, -me- (LoWLiFe), and
        Cthulhu by train, a fuckin' long trip for about 6 hours !!!
        Well that's all for now, l8er -LoWLiFe/Elite(ndo)/Eternal-

22:49   What is important... Oha, LoWlife - arrive... ahum, waddya think,
        if many dudes will arrive t'morrow ??! I am as tired as 18:00 o'clk
        and Shadowmaster throwed me off the nice Falcon with the less nice 
        but anyway best Paintprogramm from Eclipse because he want to draw
        a Logo-Gaargh ! I want to draw a picture !! After I started to draw
        a Logo, which was SHIT !!!! to get used to the programm a bit, I
        now started to draw a nice little (very little) border for my
        picture, which i now don't know what it should be, but that it 
        should be nice ! Something like a Magician,dragon or a face ...
        Let's hope that the N-BUNDY will be on the Magdisc so that every-
        body can say whether she is it or not... It isn't discussed anymore,
        but who's interested in fashion... ????!!! Okay, maybe I am a bit
        too tired ... ? /jMS

Some seconds later....(Charon (me !) still hasn`t got a watch...)
O.K. JMS of A.M. has just told me the time, but I`ve already forgotten again.
Yeah ! Finally the little demo works, shit, Suicidal made the worst code
I`ve ever seen in my entire life !!!! ...And I only got it working coz
I`ve removed the tube/routine....which was actually the the main thing in
the screen......fucking bad code......buaaah !!!  Now there`s only little
work left, today or tomorrow I will most certainly release 3 sound disks
in one day !!!  Wow !   I think I`m going to use....bah !  who cares about
that !!!  Bye from me....


23:05  What a terribly boring shit party, I spent hours watchin that boring
       shitty CD-I from that Dutch electronica firm (I believe from Eindhoven)
       There are also three unique demo-menu's! (All dungeon master menus like
       in the Skid Row demo) but one of them is really special, because it is 
       the first one on Falcon 030 (hopefully not the last one). It has cool
       graphics.
       It really is becoming a busy event (About twice as much people as a 
       few hours ago, so it makes a total acount of 2 (TWO) people).
       See you in heaven,

       Metallix here, i finished the f*cking demo!!!!! what shitty
        bugs are there in the world may I ask?????????????

I wonder who will read all this shit in the mag! I would not...
Okay...something positive...the Falcon is a fantastic machine, but#
I bet we all know that...
hope the first megademo will be a sucess...

23:31: Lot's of noise, but it's happy freaking here!!


23:44 MAMMA !!

23:48 At last! At first I thought I wouldn't let myself have a go at writing
      a piece of text for this article, since I've been busy drawing a new
      Synergy logo for the last 4 to 5 hours, but since the damn thing is
      finally finished (pixel-mania), I'll give it a go:

      Synergy goes Bremen, part 1:
      -Rise at 0430H, The Hague, Holland.
      -Car travel of about 6 hours, due to STAU, backtracking revolves in
       the fact the we could as well have used a Trabant instead of the
       car of my choice, a VW Golf 1.8l.
      -Entering a building in the middle of nowhere, consoled solely by 
       the information that 20 DM should make us feel at home.
      
      following in a limited amount of time:
      Part 2 of Synergy goes to Bremen......
      your host for this session, Zanac/SyNeRGy.

0:08  Well, today is tomorrow, I mean today is one day after yesterday,
      or, in other words, it is after midnight now, anyway...
      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!

      This was a very constructive, creative and important contribution
      to this realtime mag. Hhhmmm... Realtime ??? I mean, if something
      is REALTIME, you usually count the time in scanlines or frames...
      I mean... How many frames did it take to create dis text ??? 
      Remember, this is a mono monitor running at 71Hz. So writing all
      of this bullshit took too many frames to call it realtime, I guess.

        Ok, Lowlife again, after having a lousy nap this night, staying
      on the groundflour with nothing between me and the groundflour,
      I must say it was pretty inconvenient. Well, waiting for Jen, to
      go to town to get some bread etc. The fuckin' shops over here are
      closed at one o'clock. Hope Independent will get the 3x3 meter
      RGB Screen, as they said. Buurk, I'm still a bit tired. After
      beaten all guys in 'Alien Gate' on the CDI System. Well signing off
      for now, l8er -* LoWLiFe *-

08:38
      Yep Slimer here, i'm just checking the article and it begins to look
      like a pretty cool realtimer......
      I slept pretty badly coz' that assehole from Synergy called " Chrome"
      kept us out of our sleep !
      ( Bonus is still sleeping at this time .......... )

08:??


8:51  ARGL!!!  Integer here and I really hate those dutch guys !! (still..)
      Chrome made us laugh all the time so that there was no chance to get
      even a piece of sleep. At about 3'o clock in the morning, they started
      making photos !!! Anyway, the whole thing starts to be funny!
      
9:57  Hi there, this is Chrome again back from the land of the coma-tozed,
      it seems that some people where a bit annoyed about the way I acted in
      one of the sleeping rooms yesterday. Well I'm sorry, but most of the
      guys where amused and they didn't have to go and sleep in the same
      room as I did, didn't they? Well I think I won't continue the grunting
      session and everything I did last night again 'coz it ain't that good
      for my voice and so ... Stay safe!
   
10:27 I AM TIRED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tyan ........ zzzzz

10.30 We have just been shopping for food in a local shop.... food is so
      cheep in Germany!?!, well cheep next to the prices of English food.
      I go a limited amount of sleep last night, and was up and working (?)
      at 6.00am.... Ok I am off to try some of the food we have just 
      bought!                  

10:57 Just a short message from Wingleader/Synergy, it's nice to be here 
      although i'm very tired and i still haven't got any german money.
      The banks are still closed and the postoffice refuses to give money
      to us, so we'll have to wait until the rest of synergy are coming
      back from the main postoffice and they will hopefully have changed 
      some money otherwise we can go home and fuck ourselves.
      And now something completely different, why has every german an 
      Falcon and i don't ?
      
12:10 uh, a long time nobud wrote sumthing !! Ahum, we (me (jMS),Shadow-
      master,ZaXx,Integer,Xstian) were shopping, and because we had so much
      Things, we just took the bags with us out of the shop !! But we
      brought it back ! Just at the moment i am about to finish some ,erm,
      "nice" Animations and Pictures (Hehehe!) /jMS
      "we brought it back" means we  (Integer and ZAXX)

12:26 YEAH!!!!!!!! Finished my little peace of muzak. Now I can drink my
      apfelkorn. Hmmmm, did I hear we have to make an intro for diz mag??
      Well, I think there are many cool blokes 'round here so BYE
                                                               >-* Iso *-<
12:34 Moin Moin, Samurai from Inter here. That was even more lame, wasn`t
      it Integer. Well at the moment it is very very boring. My Falcon is
      Raytracing the Title Pic for the `Fried-Bits-Party-Demo`. If we don`t
      finish it here then we will continue writting because it will be
      the first Demo only for Falcon. So, wait and see. 
      Bye Bye by Samurai.

12:45 Well this is Chrome again back from the shops, we got around three
      shopping-trolleys full of food and drink, so we'll probably survive
      until monday. We got some improvised plates for our cornflakes, namely
      deep-freeze containers ... They're quite good for the job. I'm enjoying
      a bowl of "Frosties" right here, right now. I was quite depressed in
      the morning 'coz I didn't take my contacts out, so my eyes hurt and I
      didn't have any breakfast until now ... Well I'm gonna eat some more
      and leave you with this article ... bye for now ...

12:59 Soon it will be 13:00 (p.m.) 

13:00 Hello people, I want to tell you a little story. A few years ago there 
      was a boy who wanted to have a computer. So he ordered a Falcon 030 and
      he also bought a program called 'Deluxe Paint'. He really liked this,
      and at this moment he is the lamest guy in this whole party coz he is
      only making some crappy colorcycling piccies. I have a message for this
      guy: Why don't you buy an Amiga? There are more lamers like you on that
      machine!!! 

      
13:35 He,He finally i got something to eat, my stomach tells me that it is
      full of food and that's what i like...... No more to say a lot more 
      to do.
      Signing off Wingleader/Synergy

  
13:50 Yo Slimer on the keys, beside me are a couple of guys playing and
      watching a CDI player.
      They are watching documentory's about camera's and childeren stuff,
      really weird !

14:34 POWA of The Mega 4.... (struggling as always...)
      WHAT!!!  You mean hardly anyone came here to type something after
      an hour!!??!!  Hey, I guess we all must be real busy with getting
      ready for the Dentro Compo!  NO.... I haven't finished my part yet!
      DAN (of Redlite) hasn't got his own monitor which is a bit of a
      bummer, as when he wants to use his STE I have to shut down mine.
      Effectively we're sharing a monitor!!! PHOOEE!!!!  Last night I
      WENT CRAZY!!!  I was bashing my head against the ST's keyboard as
      the blasted thing sometimes likes to crash by going into 60Hz
      without so much as a 'by your leave!!!'.  It's horrible!!!  It
      completely screws up the reset-proof RAM DISK!!!  However there is
      a subjective subtle remedy... I just shout "FALCON" and all of a
      sudden the computer starts behaving... weird huh???
      Anyway while I'm here I'll send greets to the rest of The Mega 4
      who unfortunately can't be here, and also to DIGI TALLIS, CHAOS,
      REDLITE as all those who I know well.....   if you want to see
      other greetings..... look out for a screen by TM4 of somethin'...

      This is POWA signing off...... (maggie work 2 do!!!!)

14:44 New Trend says: AMAZINE is the best.......Sorry, this is the truth...
      Megahi to Sink and Stranger of Hemoroids....


14:45 I don't F**kin care at all and that's the truth, Slimer !!

14:49 Since I went into the room with my disx, I gave away about 50 of them!
      I'm gonna lose control if the people don't stop taking (and copying)
      my disx.... to tell the truth (as usual): I'm glad to see that i'm at 
      least good enough for that (Hi Samurai!, fine saying!). I just couldn't
      get that: my list is really old (who said "lame" !?) but there still 
      seem to exist people like me, who just collect nearly every demo they 
      can lay their hands on... (also noch mehr Verrueckte wie ich...)

14:59 Guess who wrote this !?! /jMS/ It wasn't me !

15:03 I HAVE JUST SEEN RESETABLES. OOHHH, THEY ARE DEAD MEAT !
      ( 'coz they smell and look like dead meat ( dead for a long time )
      thymian looks like a big ugly pig.../ Mr. Bond

15:09 Argh Shit !!! I am now here for 22 hours and I still haven't got a
      Monitor. I just brought my old ST with me, because I came by train,
      and the bag was heavy enuff !! But Stallion/C38 perhaps will collect
      a BIG TV from his home for me ! NICE, guy !! Let's see ... But
      better than no monitor. I am sharing the STE with Shadowmaster now...
      And he also don't like this so much ... /jMS

Still don`t knowing what time it is, here is Charon again...
O.K....well it is 16:30....
It seems one of the sound disks will certainly be finished today, perhaps
even all three....all bugs are killed....grandma is dead......and ernie got
a new pudding.....haha.
That`s it...bye....


15:11   Arrgh, I definitely hate line-routs. (esp. mine, coz it doesn`t
        work...  )    The Energizer is now going to shoot himself with
        a competition Pro....


15:12   "goodbye Energizer!", you've been a quite friendly guy...
        I feel really sorry for the fact that TRACK41 had not the time
        to come...  the called me thursday evening and told me to greet
        everybody from them :   GREETS FROM TRACK41 !!!  (reicht das Toddel?)
        the slave has done its job... 


16:48   Yooh Bonus at the key's. I have played with a Neo Geo for about
        1 and a half hour. Great machine, very nice gfx and sound. Hope 
        there will be games out for the Falcon that look as good as the one's
        on the Neo Geo. Okay must go on with more important things so goodbye
        There is a large gape between the last article and this one, i think
        it is because of the fact that Tempes makes the screen black when it
        isn't used...


16:55   Yes, my left/right border works on most st's or ste's i've seen here
        so my mind is of a load of presure...   (ultimate of dull) 
        P.s. my left/right border fucks up on bonus's Ste... (shit!!!)
        beye beye..

16:57   Well, plenty of things to play with here, man what a lot of Falcons, 
        it seems that you can't afford not to have one, and if you see what 
        they are doing with it, you will be persuaded to get one. (was that 
        word O.K.? gee, I don't know, but who cares to read this anyway). 
        Well better get back to work, and finish the mod (or wipe the disk 
        and make a new one). Bloody noise around here, I can't even hear my 
        own music.....  XTC1 Dull

17:07   JA! JA! POWA specken here!!!  Listen... I've got something REALLY
        important to tell everyone about the Falcon 030 and it's DSP...
        Well you know...... hang on.... did someone say PIZZA!!????

        I'm outta' here!!!              (POWA. The Meag 4)

17:09   But i like Mc Donalds more.

17:32   Mc Donalds rulez !

17:37   D'ya think so? I ordered a pizza ....

17:40   Carnera / NPG and Penguin / Animal Mine here again (as promised
        yesterday !). Mc Donalds rulez ???? Can't believe it !
        Ok, let's vomit (kotzen !) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        Der Big Mac war kalt sagt der Mike von STAX ! Jawoll !!!!
        Ein FruchtZerg liegt hier - ausgeloeffelt !!! Der arme Kerl!!
        Der FALCON ist echt SCHEISSE......PC RULEZZZZ! Hollaendisch 
        klingt echt komisch!!
        HOOHOHaOhHHùOH!! 
        M.C. (Mc Donalds ?) joint die party !!!!
        Mein eher bescheidener Beitrag zu diesem Bull: Bier macht lustig !!!
        Toll M.C. - wir danken Dir !!! Ein ganzer Hecht, woll ????
        Ok, let's speak ENGLISH once again. Penguy (as Mad Vision would
        say) here ..... the party is really funny .... it's possible
        to order a Pizza Fotze in this town .... let's eat it !!! Hechel !!
        Over and out ... see (read) us later !!!
        Bye !

17:57   Ik heb net gemerkt dat er een paar gekke Duitsers zijn die
        vinden dat nederlands leuk (maf? gek? idioot?) klinkt! Hoe komen ze 
        daar nou bij?  But to stop with the Dutch crap, I would just like to
        emphasize that this (cool? Mwoaahhh...) party is totally uninspiring 
        for me! I already should have painted about 3-4 logos but due to 
        boredom I haven't done anything yet...  Oh well, that's life ! HVC


MARC R. ist ein alter SACK!!! ...Blutsauger!


19:35   Well, everybody is back from the Mc Donalds now.
        Just a note..........

19:57   So, jetzt wisst ihr wie spaet es war!

20:03   A Yeeaah ! Just played the GREAT NeoGeo for sumtime !! Womwom,
        shoot'em'ups for president !! But every game is just great ! 
        Much better than SNES, if ya ask me, but also more expensive !
        /jMS


20:10   Just read the whole article... Poor Mr.Bond Hahahahaa !! But
        I still doN'T HAVE a M O N I T O R !!

20:15   Hi!  Greetings from da Iso (no more 2 say)

19.30   I`ve got a time-machine !!!

20:21  (real time) the song "Headhunter" written by Front 242 is in my
       ears, I'm filled up[ with beer, my disx seem to be lost ( only 
       about 10 pieces) and I really gonna miss my girlfriend (Nadine)
       infact, I DO love her (even though Rapido of Synergy won't  
       believe that)  what else to say ? "ICH SAUF JETZT EINEN MIT 
       GUENTER!" (Member of Synergy)   Integer signing off (slightly 
       drunk)

Just after this....
       Here`s again Charon....I don`t know what I should do now, I`m
       waiting for Mr.Pee to go to the McDonald`s.....and behind me,
       they are still playing Front 242 !!! YEAAHH !!!
       Can somebody give me a watch ?!

20:24   Eating German pizza's (buurk!), having red eyes from all the
      smoke and irritating people playing Streetfighter 2 on the SNES,
      I must say, it's quite a good organised party. Well, Rapido
      is walking around with his 24567th can of beer. Mmmmm, well
      have to go now, lotsa places to go, people to kill, LoWLiFe .
