REALTIME PART 6
        
0:05   And again it is my turn to write the first message tomorrow,
       I mean the day after yesterday, ya know...
       The more I think about the possibilities that the truecolor mode
       gives you, the more I LOVE the F030.   Manitou/PSX
       
   
Urghhhh! I finaly finished the fuckin PREVIEWgraphict (you know...
the mein menue!). I hope I will find time to make them perfect at
home, but we will see....

MC FLY

01:28 Welll this is more than likely the last time I will tap away at
      theses keys as, I want to just copy some demos, chat and stuff for 
      the next few hours.....
      
it is exactly a point in time.
      Amazing. No, i mean it. Amazing. AHHESXTC GSGSXTC GSHSJSJJSXTC J!!!!!!
      I want to scream at every person in the world so loud their arms rip
      off! We just had my demo running on an infinitely large videoscreen
      and most of germanys scene was watching and a lot of international
      guys too. I feel pretty good, or should i say i feel amazingly,
      astonishingly, immensely, giganticly, unbelievably, intenesly, 
      dominantly, positively, incredibly, overwhelmingly, strongly, 
      definitely, ehh..  what was i saying? Maybe i will now have to go]
      back to aigglibhthzze bhaeindth cos soon manitou (the wuppiduttisott)
      will want his, or wait MY (!!!!!!) Falcon back. But i'm not gonna
      give it to him. The demo is history. Now for what? Yes. der teufel.

1:51  Still allive and still awake (now about 42 hours !!!!) 
      In a few moments I'm going ins bett ...  Signing off   (iso)
      
1:54  It`s Charon again....
      I just wanted to add some new concerning our group....
      
      The N.A.T.O. -IS DEAD- !
      
      Suicidal (Ex-Blowtorch) will disappear on the scene, maybe forever.
      Reason: He`s a drinking metal-get-pissed-off-party freak, who
      prefers fucking 5 (different) girls in 2 hours instead of painting
      pictures or coding demos.....lucky guy....
      
      I (Charon) am going to continue on the Falcon. I hope I can afford
      one in 1 month or so. But I will still release the screens that I
      have yet done for our mega demo....but there won`t be a mega demo...
      
      I`m also going to change my name to `Quark`....This time it`s no
      joke as Jeff Smart.....On the Falcon there won`t be a Charon
      but a Quark..... 
       
      I`m looking fowrward to coding on the Falcon, there are so many new
      possibilities.....it`s fantastic !  What I`ve seen till now, makes me
      sick of coding on the ST !  I want a Falcon !!!!
      
      Send money to:
      Alexander Feige,
      Bergstrasse 45,
      6804 Ilvesheim
      
      Feel sorry for those who can`t afford a Falcon (yet)...please help !
      

02:05 It feels good to know that the Falcon could do better...
      I just heard the Track-rout from Questor, it uses the DSP and
      needs not that much CPU-time (running at 50 khz !!!) after that
      I heard a n Amiga playing a mod.... HAHAHA!
      First time in history, we can be sure, that ATARI has beaten ...
      (guess who!)
      

02:09 Chrome back on the keyboard AGAIN! Feeling very fine at this moment
      Aphex Twin's Digeridoo is blasting through the speakers and I've got
      a can of COLD Coke. We just sort of did a freak-out session on a 
      video-wall. Grotesque rules, Front 242 rules even more ... Hopefully
      we'll see a lot of EBM and Industrial demos on the Falcon. It's so
      good to see a nice demo, which is backed by a Front 242 alike track.
        
02:19 I guess I most have the record for doing unusefull things on a
      copy party (one of them playing Streetfighter II on the SNES for
      more than 12 hours).Well,just typing this text to give a hard time
      to the text writer(har har!).Not so vommity greetings from
      Le Scav/SyNeRgY
      
2:17  Yeah, SNES is really great. Especially the Action Replay ..
      Well, delivered an intromusic for this magazine's intro to Dull so
      my job now only is to go too bed coz with all the alcohol I'm feeling
      very sleepy....
      See ya blokes !!
      
2:16  No, that can't be the time, but who cares anyway, it is fucking late, 
      I am tired and ISO just took over my job by making the music for the 
      Dull intro. Maybe becaude I only make MOD's and Ultimate started to 
      look funny and mumble something about overscan...processsor time...
      only Falcon...bloody iodiot....etc. So I just pissed of and tried to 
      get pissed. Considering the way I feel, it is working, but there is 
      still a lot of beer left in my 1 liter can so I must continue.XTC1 Dull
      
2:24  I don`t know what I should write here, so I won`t write anything now...
      (Ex-Charon of the Ex-NATO)
      
 
2:30  Some minutes ago they told us they need screens for this fucking new
      megademo on the falcon ..... well .... we (STAX) have a little 
      problem : no falcon - no screens ....... but perhaps we buy one
      (money is a little problem .... - if we sell sodan`s car we 
      probably have the money .... nearly .... there still is a difference
      of about 300 DM !!!! 
      Sorry,we didn`t manage to finish our screen in time . But we will
      release it soon . The STAX members say good bye to you !
      
2:41  Nix mehr von uns .... I`am fucking tired and i must drive tomorrow !!!
      Last Message: My car is not for sell !!!! It should bring us to many
      more Coding-Partys in future !!! 
                                              SODAN signing off ......
                                              
2:48  Integer on the keys....
      As you all should know, I started loving that damn dutch stuff..
      So, here are same of the most important words in that f..cking 
      language:

       1. First lesson:
      -----------------------
             
           dutch          englisch              german
       *kutje       =      pussy          =      Fotze
        beftekkel   = dog sucking pussy   =   (langer) Dackel
        kankerlul   =    cancer-dick      =     Schwanzlurch
        randdebiel  =   retard person     =  stark bescheuert (Vollidiot)
        hoerenloper =     bitchrider      =    Freier  (notgeile Sau)
        pukkelneet  =     spotface        =     Arschgesicht
       *snikkel     =       dick          =       Schwanz  
        poepgat pompen=   assfucking      =   in den Arsch stossen
        takke trol  =  very scary person  =     laeufiges Weib
       *klootzak    =      eggpackage     =     'Eierverpackung'
       *snol / del  =       bitch         =   Nutte (Kelly Bundy?)
       
        *= these ones are really important (and quite popular!)
     
      credits:   
               dutch version: Chrome,Zanac,Mac,Scavenger
                              and Iso as the example
               englisch version: Danny  (thanx!)
               german version : Integer, Anzac and Danny (!)
               
      I really hope, it helps you to like (fuck?)  those damned funny 
      dutch guys...
       
3:13   endeldarmtoerist = assholetourist = endeldarmtourist

3:20  At the moment there are 106521 kilo.. aerr bytes in this article
      and if Integer is writing again so much crap there will be soon
      much much more ...........
      
      x x xxx xxx   xxx x x x   xxx xxx
       x   x  x     xx  x x x   xx   x
      x x  x  xxx   x x xxx xxx xxx xxx
      
3:24  The world is fucking depressing.
        Every coder here can code better than me.
        Every painter here can draw much better than me.
        Every musician can compose MUCH better than i will ever do.
        (Hey Scavenger, I heard of people that almost got kicked
         out of their houses by their parents because they were
         listening to YOUR chiptunes at extreme volume. Your trax are of 
         insulting fucking quality.)
       Hey people: This party is one of the greatest things that ever
                   happened to me.
                                            Manitou/PSYCHONOMIX
                                            
3:35  Some Indipendent-guys left the party (snief) and I already gonna
      miss them (Chrome is right now starting to cry) Danny, Zaxx (A.M.)
      and Sepp left us...  well, at least my favorite dutch crews stayed
      here  that means Synergy, Sentry and (ofcourse) the famous Giants
      (Hi Havoc!) That's it (who the hell wrote that our (OUR!) lessons
      are crap, heh !? It supports european community and network...)
      You have to think BIIIG !
      
3:38  Yes, yes, yes people... Once again it is Havoc who is terrorising your 
      mind. Well, at the moment the important news about our intro for this 
      ultimately brainblasting and nerve tensing magazine called 'DBA Magazine
      number 8' is: It's working! YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH
      HHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But we only have one problem left: All of 
      the parts will have to be linked and that's not very easy... Ah well,
      who cares? Other important news about this party: I am drunk, the other 
      guys are drunk and we don't care! I just hope that my hard work on 
      preshifting a font will be rewarded with a great intro/demo/screen by
      that enourmously irritating and totally uninteresting coder/lamer 
      Corsair! (Hi Integer/TDD!!!) Well, that was a commercial break for a
      great new crew called : TDD (=> The Digital Delegation!!! Wait for their
      dentro!!!) Well, currently some weird Dutch guy who is sitting next to
      me wants to puke (not without a reason, I believe...).. Ja ik heb genoeg
      getikt (ik ben getikt)...
      
4:04  Hello people, it's F.A.S.T.E.R. of da TSE here. Hope there is at least 
      one guy in the universe who remembers us (for our great (?!?!?!?!)
      tracker compils...   See ya!!!
      
04:07 Uuuh, well this is Chrome again back, to write you some more crappy
      text for this real-time article. I think I won't go to sleep tonight
      as I'll then be tired when I come home and enjoy my own bed even more
      than I would when just a bit tired ... B.A.T and Rapido are still
      coding and Mandrome and Scavenger are still playing Street Fighter II
      (they're probably trying to break the world record or something). Just
      thinking of the trip home, the thought of having to travel four or five
      hours by car to Wingleader's place already annoys me, but after that
      I'll have to travel by train for two more hours before I'll finally
      reach good old Amsterdam again ... I really miss the place, all the
      junkies on the station etc :)
      
04:28 I don't WANT to sleep, but I just HAVE to. because of the fact that
      I'm the driver, I just have to leave the night-session for the first 
      time...  Danny and Powapixel are ready to leave. ('hope to see ya at
      the ATARI-fair this year!') 
         ein immer-noch-nicht-mueder Integer (half dutch, half german)
      PS: What about some Pumpersnikkel ? (haha, Insiderjoke!)
      PPS: What's a Dutchborg ?  (just to make you read the article till its
      end...)
      
04:42 Synergy goes to Bremen, Part 2
      After drawing four logos, having about 6 hours of sleep in three days,
      and an enormous amount of fun and feedback, I can state that this
      party was indeed a success.
      Therefore the board of editors found it to be an improvement to the
      article to keep this session a short one, and a clear one.
      Many thanks to all persons present here. I had a great time.

      The future now whispers to unfold 6 hours of driving tomorrow.
      But my soul, non-maskable in its work, tells tales of even more
      importance: I'm very much longing to see my girlfriend, Fiona.
      So, before letting my brain update another 48 hours, I wish you
      all a very good night,
      
      -=> Zanac/SyNeRGy <=-
      
5:12 Nach drei Tagen, die ich maximal viereinhalb Stunden geschlafen habe,
     werde ich nach beendigung des Beethoventechnos in meinen Schlafsack
     fallen und nur kurze Zeit spaeter wieder auferstehen um nach Hause
     zu fahren. Ich wuensche allen die dies lesen einen schoenen Tag und
     kommt gut unter den Bus. Tschuess Euer "Juri der Ninja"

5.30 Now I want also put some craptext into this article. But I
     can't concentrate because from the left side it comes some
     MOD-Music and from the left some Beethoven-Music. (Wuerrrrg!!!!)
     But "Juri der Ninja" has some other meaning about Beethoven...
     and in other case he can't ANY English !!!!!!!!!!
     At this time the most guys of the party sleep. So it's very
     boring...  Only a few people code, draw and compose... I think,
     I'll do it too. Perhaps later there will come more of me...
        *Questor of Inter*
        
5:47 Some more bullshit from the distorted mind of Chrome, the ever-grunting
     Synergy member ... Seems that some actually like it when you keep them
     from sleeping, this is quite a new experience for me, can't say it's
     a bad. I'm even more looking forward to going home, or actually BEEING
     home. I wanna take a bath, eat some real food and call some friends. 
     Then have a nice sleep in my own bed with some nice ambient tunes playing
     in the background and without the smell of sweety feet and LowLife
     farting all the time  ...
     

5:?? I am not....


6:15 Carnera on the keys!! OHHHHH! I'm so tired! I can't see anything..
     I'm blind....I'm soooo tired!! Just a few crazy people are still
     awake...doing mods...watching old demos....listening to some crazy mods
     ( from Tyan of Stax....oh no, that is not true!!) ........I'm 
     now realy out of ideas whot to write so I will send some greetings
     to my friends .....Vigo of D.B.A. where are you??? What a pitty
     that you did not come!!...Hawk of TNS I hope to see you somewhere!!
     ....and to all the other people I know......I hope you like our
     2 products!!?.....The party is very cool.....Die Party ist ja 
     soooo cooolllll.....Dieser Bull-Energy-Drink vom Stallion war ja
     knueppelhart!!!Das Zeug geht voll auf die Pumpe!!!.......
     Aber trotzdem bin ich muede!!!!.........................
    
 
6:42     It is...
                       666666666                44444      22222222

                      6666666666    ::::    444   444          222

        Of course, that means a lot to me.  
        And I am still  e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y  hungry.

06:50 (or thats what I think the time will be....) anyway REDLiTE and THE
      MEGA 4 are about to leave this great party to head for the airport!,
      yes we leave for London (Gatwick), very soon.... so thanks to all
      who organised this party although most are in bed at the present time!
      D/RLC
       
      
7:10  Remember that good demonstration of the F030 that Atari (note from
      Metallix: Detlev.) did on the Duesseldorf show?
      1. There was a triangle with smoke coming out.
      2. They showed a dumb movie.
      3. They told us: This is a Falcon. It has a DSP. You can use
         it to automatically switch your light on and off at home.
      4. They loaded a strange sound demo. It crashed.
      5. They loaded it again. What happened was the biggest 
         feedback in the history of mankind (Rueckkopplung).
         It was so loud and high-pitched that 
                a) people yelled as loud as they could.
                b) they held their hands onto their ears.
                c) they ran away very fast.
      And now Atari
                - tells us to code games in GEM windows
                - gives us great video hardware and supports
                  about 10% of it with system routines.
                - gives us a dektop that is slow and does not
                  support even Tos overscan.
                - tells us that the F030 has 65536 colours, but 
                  they use "only" 32768 themselves. Getting the
                  full 16bit truecolor would require hardware 
                  hacking. Atari does not allow this. So 65536
                  colours are simply a lie.
                - sucks. (But... great hardware.)
                        
                                MANITOU/PSYCHONOMIX
                                     
7:25    POWA is leaving FRIED BITS!!   It was GREAT!!!!! (Hooray???)
        Damn nose bleeds!!!!!!
                                        bye bye    (POWA a la TM4)
                                        
7:29          The ultimate guessing game: Who wrote this ?

        I did of course (metallix) 
        "Achtung, Achtung auf Gleis 6, der satan."

07:55 An extremily tired Chrome is sort of hitting the keys in a tired
      kind of way. I think I'm gonna lie down for a while, hopefully I
      won't fall asleep 'coz  have to wake up Integer at 10 o' clock. I'm
      really annoyed by all those guys talking through a Falcon with some
      effects on their voices, it's just like small kids having an
      amplifier for the first time ... I'm really getting pissed by it.
      2000DM to have an echo and a pitch-shifter!?!?! Isn't that weird.
      Hopefully I can sort of lay down quietly and have a relaxing moment
      or two ...
      
08:00 Time to get some sleep now, even I (XTC1) can't do without any 
      sleep. 5 minutes ago I was looking for my sleeping bag, but somebody
      must have moved it 'cause I can't find it. Maybe I will have to wait
      until I get home this afternoon, and after I have studied Pascal and 
      electronics, for my test for school. We'll see... first let me think
      how to get rid of this bloody noise from al those people talking to 
      their computer..
      
08:15 A sound war is about to happen, more when news gets available.

08:08    About 46 Monitors in dis room. Manitou/PSX

08:16 Hi, I'm back, but I'm toooo tired to write any more, because
      the night was very long....
         *Questor of Inter*
         
08:25 Now I havent slept for 48 hours. I`m tired as hell...
      Great party. It was fun to organize it, allthough some
      crews that said they would come, didn`t come...
