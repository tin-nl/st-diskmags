12:41 Where here !! Set up and ready to go...

12:54 Hi there, I had nothing to do so I thought why not write something for
      the real-time article. I'm quite tired 'coz I had just about 10 hours
      of sleep in the last 2 days, we also left from Holland at 6 'o clock
      this morning, I'll type some more shit later 'coz I haven't got any
      inspiration right now ...
 
      =-> CHrOmE/SyNeRgY

13:33 After an about 5 hours drive from the Netherlands in some French car, we
      are also available for the funtimes on the 'Fried Bits' party kept in
      Bremen, Germany.
      I am Eagle of Sentry and came here with Iso and Mac, while Iso's father
      decided to bring us the 500 Km of 'Autobahn' (not bad for a dad).
      For as far as I can judge the party, it is cool. We have installed our
      sleeping bags and stuff in a separated room (coz otherwise every one can
      enjoy us ...).
      There are at the moment about 14 Falcons on the party. So while in the
      Netherlands the Falcon is nearly available (and if it is, as in the
      three stores that sell it at the moment and got three machines each) for
      the price of 2400 DM, Germany is sold out for 2000 DM already!
      But no shit, we need a girl with 'pit' (that one was for the dutch
      readers).

               Co-sisop: Yoshi Unck (Toeters en Walnoten onder
                                     voorbehoud! (this one is
                                     for insiders (like we (
                                     Eagle, Iso, Mac and Lowlife
                                     (Hotline))) all know))


14:02 Yoshi (Iso) on the keyz, eating cocktail nuts. I think they're playing
      2 much death metal and that sort of crap mus.
      By the way, I'm the one who made 1 music for thiz mag.
      Well, at the moment I need: 
      (1) A girl
      (2) A bottle of some nice alcoholic drink
      (3) Inspiration for a horrrrrrorrrrr song
      (4) Pizzas
      (5) No fight
      etc....

      Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, just drank some Coke.
      
      
      If U need some music for a (non)commercial product, just write me
      (find my address somewhere else)
      bye

14:29 Back again on the keyboard, yes it's me Chrome again ... Don't
      have any more inspiration, but I wanted to do something usefull
      (okay, not that usefull, but still). Go see "Braindead" it's the
      best trash horror movie I've ever seen. It's by Peter Jackson, yes
      that's the same one who made the cult-classic "Bad taste". If you
      like that one go and see this one even more blood, bodyparts been
      thrown around. It's one of the best ... Also make sure to get the
      uncut version 'coz otherwise you'll miss a lot of good fun ...
 
      =-> CHrOmE/SyNeRgY!


14:39 I'm having a pizza in about 2 hours and then I (Iso) hopefully have
      some inspiration 'coz I'm really broke down at the moment.
      AAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      (sorry)                
      Okay, now Danny O. is laming around in this circle of creatures
      out of hell. They are very afrightened. Well, some faces maybe
      out of hell (maybe). 

15:00 I'm acking for love right now. I do miss the the beautiful sight 
      of my boyfriend. I dream of him taking me between some moisted sheets.
      Argh, if we only could finish this dentro it would make me just as
      happy.  

      Rapido/SYneRGay


15:10 Hi there people, I'm Bobby.... noooooo!! (that was lame, ehh?)
      This is INTEGER of TDD, a new group in the ST-Scene (ahm, ahm)
      The onlz thing .... raaahh!!! couldn't write a word: Rob (the one,
      who calls himself "Rapido" tells me all that rubbish I definetelz DON'T
      want to hear at the moment (anyway: he's a nice guy...)
      to tell the truth (by the way: I'm doing this all the time)  I just LOVE
      that guy (noooh, NOT what you're thinking of !)
      what else to say (?)....  our Dentro is not yet finished, because of the
      illness of our beloved coder (370). 
      ARGL!  I reallz HATE that dutch stuff ! (the language, the keyboard...)
      thatx it for now (I'm going to give some guys of Animal Mine a lift)
      see ya !                 Integer of TDD  
      ps: kondome schuetzen !!!


15:31 Oh, I see my boyfriend is longing for me.. oh aaah. I can understand.
      These parties with all those sweaty bodies scrubbing against him.
      Tall, beardy machos getting him all WET. I understand my love, but be
      patient.. tonight after some hours of coding when we're overdosed
      by our monitors.. oh, tonight.

      Mandrome of Synergy

 Mir faellt ja sowieso nix ein...


15:52 Well, REDLITE and THE MEGA FOUR have arrived from Britian, we have been
      here for about two hours and thinks are looking good....  You have 
      never seen so many Falcons in one place before!!!!
        .. Wo auch? (Anm. von Akira) ...
      , well this was a 
      short visit to the real-time article as I am fresh out of ideas....?!
      I will return........

16:12 Still no pizza .....

16:25 Danny is very hungry. He attacks the guy next to him and try
      to get his bollocks.

16:35 This is Slimer typing, more and more people are coming.......
      Maybe it's fun after all !?

16:47 Synergy is hungry, very hungry. Were coming to get you ...

   
I have just eaten my Rindergulasch (The Pizzas of the others will arrive 
in about two hours....I am fed! I feel fine...

17:00  Animal Mine is here. Penguin, M.C. and Shadowmaster arrived !
       More to read later .....

17:02  "Wingy" (of Synergy) is still hungry....  this is gonna be quite 
       dangerous for us...  (let's hope that he gets his BIG (BIG!) Mac 
       in time !!!   we tried to do another dentro in time but this is 
       more than hopeless without our coder (Hi 370!).
       I just brought JMS of A.M. to the party (well, Integer is a nice guy
       isn't he ?) and...well... he's already getting on my nerves... (nix
       fuer ungut, Matsche!)


17:15  Hi there, here is Corsair o/t Giants! An hour ago we came here 
       and we just have unpacked our machines. I have just heart the new
       musixpieces of XTC 1/Giants and ISO/Sentry. They sound very nice. 
       I have to look around some more because there are many people I don't
       know but also some I do know. Well I quit know with typing, later I
       continue 'coz as everybody I've no subject to talk about.

17:23  People of my beloved kingdom, this is your master Havoc speaking. I
       have noticed recently that my servant Corsair was talking crap to you. 
       But I suspect strongly that you didn't expect anything else from him, 
       even worse, you might even know that he can't do otherwise. Oh well, I 
       will punish him soon enough... (I am bored ya know, that's why this
       utter crap has to reach your eyes/ears...).

50:50  yes, that's true.

       Yes...very, very true!

17:40  Shut your mouth, Havoc!

18:05  Who the *hell* is Havoc ????!

18:07  Wer ist denn nu Havoc ????

18:10 I (Iso) hate when there are no pizzas!!!!!!!!!! (Sob, sob) I'm soooooo
      hungry!!!! Well, nice party, nice people, nice machines, it's a nice
      party. I don't know if I can finish my horrrrrorrrr music in time.

18:16 Hi there!!! It's POWA of The Mega 4 here!!!  I'm the only one of The
      Mega 4 who is here, in Germany, in Bremen, at the FRIED BITS ST party
      being held by LAZER & CHANNEL 38.  It's a nice small place here to
      code, but I have to admit... I've seen LOADSA FALCONS here!!!  It
      seems the days of the STF,FM,E are well and truly numbered!!!
      I've seen some really GOOD dentros/demos whilst I've been here!!
      Scavenger of Synergy showed me his blip-blop editor.... PRETTY NEAT!!
      For now I better get on with it... there's LOTS of work 2 B done!!
                                        POWA of The Mega 4.

                                        P.S. ..... I'LL BE BACK!!

18:30 REDLITE are back on the keys.... god thats sounds so lame.....!! 
      Anyway I just been looking at some nice effects on the Falcon.
      Well hunger is setting in and there is no sign of any food, so I am
      off to eat...
                     Bye for now!!??....

18:36 Integer on the keys...  I still hate those dutch stuff (except the
      delicious HEINEKEN-beer). I just copied (nearly) everything of
      Sepp's Harddisk ("abgesaugt!") - I had his permission 
      what about some ... eehh...  BIER !!!!  (jau!, ich zieh' mir jetzt
      mit Robbi ein Warsteiner rein!)
      Prost !

18:37 Falcon Rulez. I just thought you should know that. (Manitou/PSX)

18:40 Falcon doesn't rule. I just just thought you should know that. 
      (Winnetou/ABC)

18:42 Yep, yep... It's him again! But it seems that nobody knows me... Or at 
      least the lamers don't (but they weren't invited (but they don't know me
      so they are lamers anyway)). Well, I am now very interested in getting 
      something decent to eat and drink. Nobody seems to know where the 
      cafetaria is in this shitty city Bremen. But well, maybe I'll eat
      someone's arm or something....

19:17 Havoc needed about half an hour to paint that !!!  (a shame. isn't it?)


19:20   Hello and Welcome... Mr.Coke is typing some Bullshit onto thiz STF
        and I try to optimate my dungeon in TRUE COLOR on Falcon 030..
        Why not, Ok my friend Patrick will write any other stuff now..
        C.U. Later then...

19:26 I've had my pizza now.   NO MORE PIZZAS THIS TIME coz Iso is full..

A bit later (...haven`t got a watch...):
Fuck ! My new demo doesn`t behave like I want it !!!!
(This was a stupid comment by Charon / NATO)

19:42 (no, it is really 42) very, very,very,VERY important message from 
      Metallix of Psychonomix: I may have forgotten my toothbrush.

19:50 Yooh now i have i change to type some shit. Spoke with so many people
      that my head is spinning with new information. But okay it very nice
      here indeed, and i am off to get even more info so bye for now...
                                                            Bonus Software

19:53 Just in case i didn't tell you before, ... the  FALCON RULEZ !!!
      The video processor is pretty nice'n complex !!! 
      There seems to be a very fucking big problem on this party:
      Metallix DID forget his goddamn toothbrush. I guess tomorrow
      we will all brutally die because of sulfuric gases that are
      the typical result of Metallix forgetting his toothbrush on
      conventions. Well, it was nice to walk on this planet...
      
      Shit... I haven't gotten my Falcon to display the full 832*296 (RGB)
      pixels yet. I can do it in GFA, but not in ASM and I don't know
      why. But I guess this is as interesting to you as Theodore
      Roosevelt's toes.             (Manitou/Psychonomix)

20:10 Holsten Bier ist auch nicht schlecht....

20:18 Yaaarccghhkk!!!!
      What's it all about eh?  FALCONS FALCONS FALCONS!!!!!
      EVERYWHERE!!!  Now I guess I'm starting to see why people might
      not do guestscreens for Teknofear!!!  None the less if you're
      reading this, the deadline is still a way away!!!  Teknofear is
      (perhaps!) our last ever demo on the STFM... so if you're an eager
      MC-68000 coder then don't hesitate....  get in touch with me...
      POWA!!!   Ooo-err....  well I've done bugger all really as so many
      crews here are showing me their demo previews on my ST.  Damn....
      Hopefully teh next time I type something here will be when I've
      achieved somethin'!!!!!!          (POWA/TM4).

20:26 This is Chrome of Synergy back on the keys again. I'm very sleepy at
      the moment, but I'm feeling quite okay overall 'coz I just ate a pizza
      which was quite big (Maybe that's why thy call it a Jumbo!). The party
      is quite cool, although I thought the place where it would be held
      would be bigger 'coz it's quite crowded in here. Think I'll make my bed
      in a couple of hours 'coz I really need to sleep, otherwise I'll break
      down during the night or so ... Well a quick greet to the ones I know
      and love ... CU L8er ... And remember stay: Beneden met vrede!
      
      =-> CHrOmE/SyNeRgY!

20:47 Ahmmm... I am also quite sleepy,cuz the week before this kewl paaddy
      I was in Frankfurt and I was awake till the night every day.. Let's c
      when I will go to bed... Oh,i didn't saz WHO i am... But is this im-
      portant, who i am, *when* i AM ?? A.M ??! Okayokay... 
      Ok. back to who i am after the point is
      clear THAT i am, and maybe also WHAT i am ! Bored ?? okay, this is
      @ jMS of Animal Mine @ boring you ! Grafixartist, if you didn't know
      it... Hmmm, whatowritenow ?? I think I will (perhaps) continue later-
      on and now let somebopdy (something?) on the keys, because at the
      moment I am quite tired. But kewl saumples playing here !! Just urgh,
      argh,wum,ramm and so on. For a shoot'em up , i think ?? Did we say
      that I think ? Yes, I think we did.... Okay, goin' to be philosophical.
      Is it NOW ... 20:53

dunno   Hell. I am what should be defined as beyond tired. For three 
        consecutive nitez I've slept less than 4 hours and I basically
        live on the high caffeine content in my blood (97.3%). I am 
        finishing our demo and somehow nothing worx. I hate the world.
        I hate life. I hate reality. I love conventions. Oh, I have not
        yet stumbled across my toothbrush but that mite be due to the fact
        that I have not looked yet wether I have it or not. so much for
        the remains of what used to be metallix when i was still alive.
        Warum geht nichts????? Boris, deine screens machen alles inn aasch.
        Rotze.(Found my damn toothbrush!)


21:10   Ok, M.C. and Penguin are here to bore you to DEATH ! The Party
        becomes cooler, the people drink more and more, the Falcon
        stuff lokes pretty good und dat Bier schmeckt auch.
        Ok, M.C. want to make a call .... see us later .... Tschau !
        Der Pinguin geht auch !

21:30   RAGL!!!  A few seconds ago, I (Integer) and Shadowmaster had a strange
        arguement:  a piccy of Kelly Bundy, a character of the famous "eine
        schrecklich nette Familie" (original titel:"love and marriage") I and
        ZAXX (Animal Mine) were quite sure that it IS Kelly, but Shadowmaster
        resistet on his opinion that it is NOT Kelly...  anyway - the piccy is
        really pretty (huh!). If anyone wants to get it (well... who is it 
        anyway?) - just contact me (I'm more than interested in YOUR opinion!)
        by the way: there are more Bundy-fans than Falcons here....

21:32   Nooo!! And she isn't Kelly Bundy !! Hmm, after we disussed if,what
        and why i am now we discuss more,erm... "sweet" thinxx ! ahem...
        Send your votes !! You should find my adress somewhere in this mag,
        or not ??! /jMS

21:55   HEy!!!  That's X-mas and Eastern at once !!!  I just met Sodan of STAX
        one of my best and longest (about 3 years) contax !!!  This is really
        funny !    Oh boy, I LOVEEEEE   that Paady !!!  
        integer signing off...

21:59   Lief dagboek, ik mis mijn mammie............

22:06   Waar zijn we nou helemaal mee bezig? Sjeesuskuhristus, er is hier echt
        iets volledig mis... (ik bijvoorbeeld)   HVC

22:07   I STILL HATE THAT DUTCH STUFF !!!
