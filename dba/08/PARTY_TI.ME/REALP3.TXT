REALTIME PART 3

20:30 Hmm, what to do ?? I just painted a (very) little piccy with the
      Eclipse Paint in Truecolour (On the F030 ofcuz!) Let's see if it
      will be included in the Demo... Which demo ? *THE* Demo !

20:43 Seems that the other people aren't anoyed with my music taste so
      I probably will be enjoying music from the like os: Kraftwerk,
      Front 242 and Depeche Mode all night long ... Loud stereos rule!
      =-> CHrOmE/SyNeRgY!
      
DIRECT ANSWER: P L E A S E stop that noise! Play Metal or at least 
               "normal" music...no techno anymore...
                But "Depeche" or "Kraftwerk" is still okay with me.
                NO MORE TECHNO, PLEEEEZE! My ears....

20:??  Hey! Someone has a good taste here! how about some real noise?
       I don't mind front but all other stuff is pretty disco-like
       and (in the background there is a sample "Techno-top" all the time)
       a few people here might like some metal too. Flabuttsnadratt.

20:55  Shadebobs rule. 16bit truecolor offkohs. (Manitou/PSX)

20:59  And suddenly some1 grabbed the keys and some1 came sitting next 2
       him.. Hi Integer!!

       Hi Iso !  I loved your farckings yesterday night (gut geblaeht!)
       what's about your opinion about the 
                                                music
                                                party so far

                                                german guyz awake !!!

                                                listen 2 (soft house, quiet

                                                house.
    Well, these were my answers so far. By the way, Int., where do U live?
    
    To tell you the real truth (as everyone is used to), I still live in
    that little (!) town, where we've got that very famous street, called
        ----_-____---__---_>  REEPERBAHN !!!!! <--_-------____---
    That means, I live in HAMBURG (YEAH!) the place where Lonestarr of NPG
    lives...

    Another question....  NOOOOOH!  We won't bore you (our beloved reader of
    this crap, bullshit and so on..) anymore with that ("Ihr seid gestraft 
    genug!")      
    Integer of TDD and Iso of Sentry are signing off...

Okay...when there are METALFREAKS here around, why are we not able to

22:52  Well as far as I (hey! that's ME!) know, the "reality is a lie" had
       a major bug (hehehe) and some of the coders have to optimize 
       (anyway, the demo looked quite nice so far !) Right now, Tyan of 
       STAX is sitting at my right side and tries to get a real (and that
       means: "REAL!") bass-sample...  the mod sounds quite nice so far (Iso
       sitting on my left side just said "...shit" - guess WHO is wrong!)
       Have you ever heard Iso singing?  Not? ...lucky guy! (more than 
       horrible)  ...a nearly destroyed Integer signing off...


23:01  Yeah, that's the way to do it, go to sleep at 13:00 and wake up
       at 22:00 so I can't get any pizza's. 
       Stupid prick I am.

23:07  It's Wingleader again, i stopped playing cards an hour ago and know
       i'm listening to somebody who tries to make music with the sample 
       Nintendo,Nintendo, Etc. and this sounds very odd. I hope that i can
       get some sleep tonight otherwise i'll think i'm going to die
       realtime. Scavenger is playing Streetfighter II and i think he will
       not stop doing that for a couple of hours, because he is addicted 
       to that game.

23:??  Still nothing that could be referred to as a chronometre within
       my posession. 

23:39  Halloooooo, ich bin's wieder.... Well, ya must know that this article
       is growing very fast and very large and I am veeeeeeeeeeeeeerryyyyyyy
       sleepy and some stupid deutscher is talking 2 me and I understand it
       coz he speeks English. Many german blokes 'round here ya know.
       What I need now to really wake up is a mindbendin'-boostin'-blowin'
       HOUSEPARDIE!!!!!!!!! You know, I don't really think people will
       read thiz text coz it's really the biggest real-time brainwashin'
       article in this Mag, by the way: nice music, isn't it (.....)
       You know: DBA IS LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       joke.......   no joke  . . . .. ... joke ..... no . .well, never mind

23:50  Strange....  I just met Jetpower of white Status. "That's nothing of
       interest", I can "hear" (haha) you think - but I got a letter from him
       6 months ago and... lost it! now, after all this time, I and Iso 
       wachted the new Megademo "Reality is a lie" and suddenly I remembered 
       that guy, named Jetpower. Well, we decided to stay in contact now and
       that's why I'm so happy, happy, happy,...   at the moment! 
       Anyone who still thinks that this is not interesting cannot imagine 
       what's going on here in Bremen.    a satisfied Integer 

23:55  again Integer:  PAIN !!!!  Iso is sitting next to me, again talking 
       this dutchy-shit (I really start to like these dutch guys...)
       Just tried to teach him german in 10 minutes... NO CHANCE !!!

         YEAH !!!      HAPPY EASTERN  (JUST KISSED ISO...)
                  ALL THE BEST TO THESE GUYS HERE !!!

        (hope to get real good presents from my parents (who said X-Mas ?)
       
      now its Iso's turn:
      
00:01  Well, I didn't survive Integer's kiss coz he didn't actually kiss me
       as he said. Well, the bloke next to me (from Stax or something)
       finished his bagger-music endlich so now I can write more comfortable.

00:03  WHAT ARE YOU WRITING FOR A BULL YOU LAZY BASTARD !!!!!!!!!!!!!
       TEKCNO-RULES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       (Das Modul ist GEIL!!! So bescheuert , dass es wieder ,...,
        naja ? oder doch nicht .........)

00:05  Well OK, Tekkno rules OK but GOOD Tekkno rules. Not that your module
       is shit but it actually is so readers: I MEAN IT....
       About the word 'Geil': that's the same word in dutch but than it just
       means that you are verrrrrrry horny and nothin' else....
       Ok, you must know that my real name is (hR1$T1/-\/-\ /\/....
       Bye folks ........

00:16 Well getting fans already, grunting dos seem to rule in the how to
      get a German guy NOT to sleep. Also shouting loud in Dutch and
      making the well-known War jokes in Dutch. Don't know if I'll be
      that good this night, maybe I'll save it up for a grand finale on
      Sunday night ... Lots of smoking and drinking Coke is needed for
      that result, but an artist has to do something for his
      audience doesn't he? :) Chrome signing of with a big grunt ...

00:32 Nene oh Nene ....

00:33 Hey (hR1$T1/-\/-\ /\/ : GEIL GEIL GEIL GEIL GEIL !!!!!!

00:54 Nevermind IsO! I'm over 50 hours awake and without XTC !!!

01:04 Hi there ! This is Sodan of Stax saying a few unimportant words to 
      you . I have just managed to paint a Logo for our little Part in the
      Fried Bytes Party Demo (or something like that!?!) and .... what can
      I say ? I just sit here and look to all that guyz who want to finish
      their screens or doing some other things like playing or sitting 
      around like me.
      Our two coders are very busy now ,coz they are coding the nice screens 
      which we have designed in a very short time and ,I think ,if you notice
      this the screens are not to bad !
      Ok, stop this boring Bullshit !!

01:16 Hi out there, on the time you read this i will be dead or nearly dead
      because of uitputting, you know four days of computing en drinken veel 
      many beer. I just want to zeggen das this is great weekend en begin van 
      the week. The only thing wat ik hasse was das the bank not was open en 
      das er in de flappentapp no money was. Thanks to diesen bank(en) where 
      there was niet genoeg money we hat an tour door BREMEN. In this tour we
      nearly rammed somebody with our LADA, and the driver of that LADA is 
      now lijdend on spierpijn in the arms and legs. But voor the rest it was 
      and is still one of the best party's. Maby zien we you wel auf einen 
      beurs in the future. This was TGD from DULL from THE GIANTS from 
      DEVENTER from OVERIJSEL from THE NETHERLANDS singing of wiss a dry mouth
      and suffecating from not genoeg slaffe. Bye voor nu and till 02:00.

01:38 Yes everybody is deadly tired here, you can see that because they
      all have very small eyes and ugly faces ( just joking )....
      I played Streetfighter II on a SNES for about an hour and really
      liked a lot. Scavenger and LowLife are so good most of the time I
      lost but then again they have played the real arcade version and I
      didn't. I am now about to go to sleep after i look in Wingleaders
      silly addresbook if my name is still in it ( who cares ??!! ) 
      I would rather have it that Miss Universe had my address so i could
      pop by and do, ooohhhhh, naugthy things !!!!!!
      You see, by reading this small text, that i am way over bedtime
      by now so see you all in the morning....
                                                    Bonus Software :-) 

01:?? Just saw the videoshow and even though i usually dislike techno 
      it is really cool. And it got a lot of people really tired so I
      can now spend some time on a Falcon. Well, see the results later
      guys. for now bye. (metallix)

Charon still hasn`t got a watch...
      Yeah, Sound-Disk 1 is finished ! There was a strange bug, but I
      finally killed it ! (The mods started playing after waiting for
      3 minutes or so ! I found out, that this was a virus !)
      Anyway, Disk 2 and 3 will follow soon...


Yippieee !!! I am in the article ! I can't believe it . Who is this
madman you probably think ... well a chaotic STAX member - this time
Mike of STAX bores you a bit ! We have 02.00 o'clock in the morning but
this doesn't matter .... really ??? Hhmmmm .... the truth is : I am
very tired . But the rest seems to be fresher than before (I can't
believe it !).I listened to some new  sounds of Scavenger/Synergy
about ten minutes ago - fantastic . But who cares about my activities ?
So I think I will leave you ... but stay with us ... only on this 
screen you are sitting first place . Only this channel ( 38 !! ) makes
it possible - you are live on this party ...... 
Bye to you says Magic Mike of STAX !!!

02:20 Ladies en mannen can u beleve this der Frans had me gepixxelt. 
     
02:22 Uhoh!! So late and I am not as tired as Yesterdayaaaaawn !! Yup !

02.30 Ahhh yes, here is ShadowMaster of Animal Mine. Dis is da first 
time that I write something in dis Real Time article....

Okay the first day was cool. A lot of guys are here. I wasnt sleeping last
night and I think that dont go slepping this night......

In the moment we are working on a new Multi Demo, we hope to release it soon.
All groups doing screens for da Falcon. Then we will be release the first
megademo for da Falcon. It will be quite good. The mainmenu is a little from
Dungeon Master in True Color. I have done some gfx for da mainmenu. It was
the first time that I painted on da Falcon.. 

upps ne cola flasche is umgefallen 
 
By the way, the party is great, cool and upgespaced.
 
2:45  Hmmmmmmmmmmmm, Iso thinks he's going to go to bed...... I'm really
      really really really really really really really tired. Bye!!!!!! ..

2:47  crazy, crazy...  Yesterday, same time, same place and nearly the same 
      people BUT  they don't seem to be as tired as they were yesterday 
      (including me... and Iso sitting again (nerv!) next to me) I really
      don't know, if I could stand that anymore (means: tomorrow) 
      No more to say ... I'll try to sleep (Let's hope that CHROME is already
      sleeping so that we've the chance to do just the same... otherwise there
      will be again all those guys from 'our' room (all the dutchies and 2 
      Germannen, who are tired all the time, because they did NOT sleep for a
      second !) It's just that CHROME is  quite funny, but 3 Days with less 
      than 4 hours sleep a day are definetely NOT enough !!!
      
      We (Iso and meine Nichtigkeit) won't bore you anymore (till next 
      morning, hehehehehehehehahahahahuhuhuhuhohhihihihi) .....

      Gute Nacht und schlaft recht schoen....

                                  Iso of Sentry
                                    and   Integer of TDD
                                     
03:22 Aargh ! Shadowmaster is filming me with the videocamera from Stallion !
      Hahaha ! Zoomzoom !!! And I am still not tired ... Funny !!
      Irgendwie fall me nix mehr in !!

03:26 Hahahaha, JMS is running away. Boring guy. Some guys are playing NEO GEO
      A quiet good game console. Some others are doing some great routs on da
      Falcon. Hab kein Bock mehr. Bye ShadowMaster of Animal Mine

sumtaim It is the sedcond nite and everyone who disobeyed their instinct
        to rest yesterday is dealing with the consequences. More than 
        half the people are gone. Still the paahrdieh is kinda cool.
        Our silly old demo is finally out and we can start making new 
        stuff at last! And i think the Falcon rules. It rules so much
        that EVERYTHING has to fly around the room and turn around all
        4 axis every two scanlines. Sorry, i cant find anything to write
        exept that i feel extremely tired and it defies the word "stink"
        here, it smells like all the horsefarts in our spiral arm
