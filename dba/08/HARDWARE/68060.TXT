Intel P5, Motorola 68060 In MPU Forum Limelight.

Intel and Motorola engineers last week detailed the superscalar, pipelined 
architectures of the respective P5 and 68060 microprocessors at the annual 
Microprocessor Forum here. 
  
(P5 decription) 
  
Motorola's 060 is a 32-bit processor with a superscalar, pipelined 
architecture.  It has more than 2 million transitors, using a 0.5-micron, 
triple-layer metal, 3.3 volt process in a static design.  Performance will 
be 3.5 times the 25MHz 68040, or about 46 Specmarks, according to Joe 
Circello, 68000 advanced microprocessor architect for Motorola. 
  
Separated in the 060 are instruction caches and data caches; instruction 
fetch pipelines (with four-stage instruction processor, a physically-mapped 
8Kbyte instruction cache with four-way self associative, a virtually mapped
256-entry branch cache and a FIFO instruction buffer), and operand execution
pipelines (with four-stage operand processor, a physically mapped 8Kbyte 
data cache with 4-way interleaving and a 4-entry, 32-bit write buffer). 
  
The floating point unit - implemented in the execution stage of the operand
execution pipeline - is compatible with the 040 FPU programming model. 
Floating point execution times range from 1-24 cycles.  The 060 superscalar
dispatch algorithm can execute 50 to 60 percent of integer code instructions
as pairs with existing compilers. 
  
The 060 will come in 040-style packaging, with a similiar external bus. 
The first versions will sample in the second half of 1993, go into production
in Q1 1994, and run at 50MHz and 66MHz.
