Torment 24 hour competition screen
by Torment / Inner Circle
review by Havoc / Giants

This is a new multipart from England, I think it's the best British 
production of the last few months. Well, let us bang the disk into the 
diskdrive and load the thing...

PART A
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
A nice spline-like thingie, cool musix, a fast slowprinter (huh?) and a 
cool logo. The font is from Thalion. It really gives an impression of good 
design.

Code    : 75%
Graphix : 70%
Musix   : 85% (one tune in one multipart)
Overall : 77%
Verdict : Cool start, really makes you wait for more.

PART B
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
A very original idea! A diagonal scroller with diagonal moving background, 
the scroller is distorted horizontally (looks cool) and behind the logo and 
the scroller are some rasters.

Code    : 80%
Graphix : 65%
Musix   : 85%
Overall : 90%
Verdict : Very original !

PART C
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
A 1 plane screen filling piccie is zooming in and out. I suppose it was 
hard to code, but it looks quite lame.

Code    : 35%
Graphix : 50%
Musix   : 85%
Overall : 40%
Verdict : Worst part of the multipart. Would have been better without it.

PART D
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
1 pixel RGB plasmas. I think it was hard to code in 24 hours, but it is 
just too slow.

Code    : 65%
Graphix : (n/a)
Musix   : 85%
Overall : 75%
Verdict : Nice, but I've seen technically worse, better looking plasmas.

OVERALL RATINGS
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Code    : 70%
Graphix : 65%
Musix   : 75%
Overall : 80%
Verdict : I gave this one a higher rating overall because I think it's the 
way to go with new (small) demos. The only real weak point is the system 
font at the end of the demo. You could at least have used the Thalion font 
again or something like that.
