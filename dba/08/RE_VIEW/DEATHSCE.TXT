_______________________________________________________________________________

There are a lot of slideshows made for the ST, we got them mostly about
woman, porno, science fiction and animals( or a combination of these )
We also saw tons of rather kinky animations of all kinds, accompagnied by
sometimes equal kinky tunes.
Lets say this, we seen them all.........but we never seen such a lame and sick
slideshow as this one.

Read and puke,

------------------------------- THE LOADER ------------------------------------

After a short time of loading, we get "welcomed" by some text with some info's
and the message that they are planning to do an awesome demo very soon.
You have to press the return to go on, some loading starts and after 15 seconds
or so, the module starts to play.

Read and cry,

----------------------------- THE SLIDE SHOW ----------------------------------

Hey i'm not even in the mood to write about this shit, but someone has to do
the job !
After all the text stuff, the first black and white pictures appear on the
screen, the module is playing with words like enjoy, dead and more.
We get to see lots of really disgusting picture's of dead people, these are
not just picture's taken from some horror movie, no these look pretty real !
There are people lying complety naked on tables, we see people who got hanged
or commited suicide.
Even a picture of a penis from a dead man with bite marks in it !!
Some of the comments with some of these pictures prove that the people behind
this slideshow are really sick people !

Most of the pictures are unclear and they are all black and white, if these
pictures where color it would be really filthy.
This slideshow can get in the hands of young kids, the pictures are not what
i call to be nice to look at !

------------------------------- CONCLUSION ------------------------------------

We recommend every PDL to avoid this one and to people who already have a copy
to destroy it and NOT spreading it( hey it's crap anyway ).

It's a pretty bad slideshow with sick pictures all in black and white.
The module is also very unclear and of(course) bad quality, it contains
words like dead and enjoy !
All pictures seem to come from some sort of video movie, it was probably
not a horror movie but it contained also real pictures.

Now for the figures, read and smile,
                                         
Code     : 2 (What code ??)               
Graphics : 2-
Music    : 2 

Overall  : 2-



Little note to ATF: Please stick to demo coding and STOP this sick stuff, 
                    there are limits and you got way over them !!!!!!
