BEGINNING OF THE ENDING
by OFFBASE of FLEXICHRON
quick review by HAVOC / GIANTS

I received this demo a few weeks ago from one of my contax and he said it 
was quite a nice demo, so... Let's boot the disk!

THE INTRO
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
A guy running... He gets shot (yeahhh! let's hope it's Emhaa!). Alarms, and 
an OFFBASE-logo flying in... The sound is high-quality, and very well 
synchronized with the demo.

Code    : 65%
Graphix : 80%
Sound   : 95%
Overall : 84%
Verdict : A good intro, very well synced with the sound. Good design!

MAIN MENU
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Some repeated pattern scrolling up and down, soundchip muzax, a rotating 
screen selector with plasmas and all in full overscan. The musix are 
irritating, the graphix simple and there is a bug in the overscan (on my 
260 ST, not on my Mega STe or my (ex-) 520 ST+). But all functions well as 
a main menu, it's simple and logical.

Code    : 65%
Graphix : 60%
Sound   : 25%
Overall : 50%
Verdict : Just a main menu, simple but effective.

LOADER
ÿÿÿÿÿÿ
A slowprinter with a reasonable font, some rasters (I think) and nice 
(soundchip) muzak. The loader (and depacker) is fast enough.

Code    : 60%
Graphix : 60%
Sound   : 70%
Overall : 63%
Verdict : Nice, fast enough and reasonably designed. 

BREAK
ÿÿÿÿÿ
A nice module, sprites, a big (64*64) scroller, tridi dots and a breakout 
game! What more could you want? (Quite a lot!)

Code    : 75%
Graphix : 60%
Sound   : 75%
Overall : 70%
Verdict : Nice screen, but boooooringgg...

RASTA
ÿÿÿÿÿ
Nice rasterscroller (plasma effect), a cool OFFBASE-logo going up and down 
and no sound. Then a disting 1-plane OFFBASE logo, a big rasterscroll and 
no sound. Then a 1-plane scrolling piccie with a big raster-scrolline, a 
moving OFB-logo and soundchip muzak. This screen is crap.

Code    : 35%
Graphix : 30%
Sound   : 15%
Overall : 32%%
Verdict : Lame... You can do this in STOS too (most of it...)

THREE (THE MULTIPART)
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
PART A
A logo appears, the sides light up and the logo fades out. Then a nice 
module starts playing. A nice disting logo, some volume indicators, 
vectorballs, a 2-plane scroller and some small pictures. It seems that this 
screen was finished too fast coz there are quite some bugs left (screen 
getting out of sync, less balls sometimes, jerking dist etc.).

Code    : 65% (could have been 75% without bugs)
Graphix : 60%
Sound   : 65%
Overall : 64% (could have been 70%)
Verdict : Nice screen, nothing revolutionary, but not bad.

PART B
A 16*16 moving scroll, 2 plane sprites, starbobs, some tridi objects, 
volume indicators and digidrum zaxx...

Code    : 45%
Graphix : 50%
Sound   : 25%
Overall : 40%
Verdict : Boring... With good design it could have gotten 70%

GOBBO
ÿÿÿÿÿ
Three monsters and a skull are singing in a quartet in this one. Nothing 
hard to code, but a cool idea...

Code    : 15%
Graphix : 75%
Sound   : 67%
Overall : 88%
Verdict : Nothing hard to code, but very funny...

TML GUESTSCREEN
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
A big sprite (Santa Claus!!!), a vertical scroll, some dots and a module. 
This kind of screen makes you say: Nice mod, nice graphix, next screen...

Code    : 37%
Graphix : 60%
Sound   : 67%
Overall : 50%
Verdict : Nice digital Christmas card... but not a screen for a megademo!

LAMER
ÿÿÿÿÿ
Moving background, tridi dots, tridi balls, a scroller and some VU-meters. 
They say themselves that this is a lame screen. It looks nice anyway.

Code    : 70%
Graphix : 70%
Musix   : 70%
Overall : 70%
Verdict : A nice screen, one of the better screens in the demo..


OVERALL DEMO RATING
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Code    : 60%
Graphix : 61%
Music   : 62%
Overall : 65%
Final Verdict : A nice demo for collectors, but not something to impress 
your friends with (except the GOBBO screen).
