EAT MY BOLLOCKS

This demo had already a review in the issue 7, but we decided to place
this second review aswell( but we will not make a habit of it )RED.


The E.M.B. Multi-Part demo by Equniox & Keops - Reviewed by BLOODANGEL 
*********************************************   **********************
 
This new(ish) demo dropped into my lap (?) the other day, courtesy of  
Tronic and I thought you dudes out there might want a review of it before 
you copied/downloaded it! Well, I will go the demo screen by  screen!
 
The Intro:
**********
 
The intro starts off with a very nice mountain background with a cool  
anti-alias 'Equinox' logo and then some rotating stars zoom onto the  
screen (Just like the Paramount intro!) and it all looks very professional. 
Then an 'Of' logo appears and then a 3D map of France  comes on, rotates 
and whizzes off again! Real nice! Then an E.M.B.  logo appears and then 
some text appears telling you about the demo  and then it tells you that
you are about to see a load of sinus dot balls!

The Six-Sinus balls
*******************

This is a nice screen, it has some quite large sinus dot balls bouncing
around! Cool.

Unlimited 3d bobs
*****************

Wow! This is one of my favourite screens in the multi-part, all these
quite small coloured 3D cubes whizz across the screen at about mach 8 and
look really nice, they change colour a few times and really look good !!

Tridi Revenge
*************

First of all a picture fades up, it is a cross between the Statue of Liberty
and medusa, quite cool! Then millions of Tridi objects go on and off and all
of them are really, really smooth and.. and...! Why didn't these guys write
'Epic'?!?

Interval!
*********

This screen is composed of loads of 16x16 bobs describing some wierd sine
curves and a little 8x8 text telling you about the demo. Not bad.

3D Bytebender
*************

Starts off with a very smooth bytebender and suddenly the whole bloody
screen starts swivelling around and you have to start reading the text
with a mirror! Then it swivelles back, swivelles half way and generally
destroys your eyes! Excellant!!!!

Interval 2!
***********

A very subtly transforming cube and some text telling you that your about
to see some balls...?!

Vectorballs
***********

The best vectorballs I have ever seen!!! They are REALLY smooth and just
most excellant! Whoa! Awesome!

Vectorball scroller!
********************

Yep a vector ball scroller, like the one in the Overdrive demo, but much
better (Easier to read for starters!) and it gives you a hint that he
can do something else with the vector balls!

Vectorballs - Part 2 - Ye saga continued!
*****************************************

Yo! This time he makes all the vectorballs squash up when they reach the
borders and it looks really realistic, all the vectorballs are sooooooo
smooth!!!

Sinus dots Sphere
*****************

Bloody huge! Very smooth! Anything else?!?

Three screens in separate cubes whizzing around the screen!?
************************************************************

A piccy in a cube, some bobs in a cube and some stars in a cube, all
going round the screen really smoothly. Nice work guys!

Jailed Stars
************

Nice idea this! You see some stars and then all the stars rotate and 
the view pulls out and you can see that all the stars are contained
in a 3d wire frame and this whizzes around. So good!

Interval 3!
***********

A p*ss take of MS-DOS, complete with miss-spellings!

Ray traced Mandlebrot
*********************

The name says it all! Not the best.

Loadsa bobs!
************

435 bobs describing a sine curve! Brill!

Wierd zooming sprites!
**********************

Wierd zooming sprites... Natch!

Light bobs!
***********

Fantastic! See the Synergy intro for D.B.A. disk maggie 6 to see what I
mean!

Guest screen - The Black Cats
*****************************

The 3D screen by T.B.C is okay, but after the 3D by Equinox it doesn't
quite cut it, but as it was coded in two weeks then it is damn good!!

Interval 4!
***********

This screen consists of some more tridi stuff, its nice!

End screen
**********

The usual Creds'n'Greets...


*************************************
* Graffix         **            89% *
* Musix           **            62% *
* Presentation    **            97% *
* Originality     **            81% *
*************************************
* Overall         **            87% *
*************************************

A really cool multi-part, the only bad thing about it is the fact that
they use one piece of Mad Max music throughout the entire demo! Apart
from that, it is one of the best demos for a long time, power to your
assemblers Equinox + Keops!!!!
