------------------------------ THE LOADER -----------------------------------

After i do the usual routines to start a program on a ST, i get a message
on screen saying : Ventura Demo - disk 1 -.
Some short loading followes and a small OVR logo appears on my screen, the
logo disappears again and the next screen says: PRESENT.
There is some good digi drum music playing and a short animation begins after
the PRESENT screen.
The graphics people are clearly inspired by the cover of an Iron Maiden 
CD/LP ( wasted years ).
I don't spoil your fun by telling you what this animation is all about, so
you have to see yourself !

At the end of the animation is a very good picture ( by Beetlejuice ) and
some textlines giving some information about the demo.
The good digi drum muzak is done by the Millenium Brothers and is quite good.

---------------------------- SCREEN INFO/LOADER -----------------------------

When you press the spacebar the piccy will disappear and the message "please
wait appears".
Then the screen info/loader starts, this is the loader that is in front of
every screen to give you info. about coding/graphics/music and more.

In this screen is a starfield, a rotating OVR logo made of balls and a dot
made scrolline in the lowerpart of the screen.
The rotating OVR logo tells you when to change disks and the amount of data
that will be loaded in a countdown procedure.
There are also textlines appearing with the info/credits about the screen.
Underneath all this plays a good piece of module music.

When the scrolltext says: press space, you have ( hum ) to press space to
see the mainmenu or demo screen.
Otherwise the loader will show the screen all by it's self after some time.
When you press the spacebar some big letters saying DECRUNCHING appear and
they disappear while decrunching, if these words are all gone, the screen
is decrunched.

------------------------------- THE MAINMENU -------------------------------

The mainmenu is in horror style, you see coffins open and close, a wolf 
passing by, Beetlejuice flying up 'n down and a lot more.
All graphics were initially designd to be used in a game but it seems that
this game will never be finished.
The first thought that run through my mind was, that this menu worked the
same as the one in the European Demo's or the one in Darkside of the Spoon.

I was wrong because this is only one screen and the menu where you can chose
your demo's is in the upper part of the screen.
You have to use your mouse to  "roll" through the list of demoscreens and
you have to click to select them.
It would have been nice if there was key option to, maybe there is one but i
couldn't find it.

Note : if you load the demoscreens with the left mouse-button you will get
the loader, the right mouse-button is without the loader.

------------------------------ THE RAPIDOMAX --------------------------------

CLICK......takaktkakakrkakakakrrrrrrr

I get welcomed by a picture that says: Typhon and Speedlight of the 
Overlanders present the Rapidomax demo.

Time to hit space ( altough it's more difficult then you think )to see the
actual demoscreen.
It turnes out to be a nice looking screen based on very old ideas and routines
just what i have said before somewhere in the introduction part.
In the middle of the screen are gold colored horizontal rasters appearing 
and they glide down ( getting bigger )and disappear in the lowerborder.
In the upper part of this screen are two T.V. screens with different level
indicators on them.
The middle of the screen is taken by a big bounching scrolline, all of this
is accompagnied by chip muzak.

------------------------------- BLASTING BOBS -------------------------------

The upperpart contains an Overlander logo ( old style ).
The midpart contains tracking sprites with the name Overlanders, at the back-
ground is a scrolline made of bobs.
After a while the bobs change from text to different objects.
Below all this (to be exact in the lowerborder) is a scrolline.

Some soundchip can also be heard, all this makes it a avarage screen with
only one nice thing, the bobs.

------------------------------ SPECTRUM SHOWPIC ----------------------------

This is basically a slideshow with a scrolline in the lowerpart of the screen
and three tracking sprites.
After a while the scrolline changes and shows textlines.

All of the pictures are avarage, the only cool thing i personally like is
the digi drum muzak, the whole thing looks like a diskfiller to me.

--------------------------------- THE GRID ---------------------------------

This screen is hard to describe but it looks a bit like a game that i used
to play that was written by Jeff Minter.
It all begins with a grid (lines forming squares), all squares are covered,
then the lid of every square falls off, revealing the text: Overlanders from
the Union.

After i pressed the long one, the main screen appears.
On the background is the grid, in front of the grid are tracking sprites
saying Overlanders, three sprites saying WBX and five rows of trackingdots 
gliding like little snakes trough eachother.
There is a big scrolline in the lowerborder and there is some module sound
i'm correct.
It's a pitty that the screen doesn't work properly on my ST.

-------------------------------- ONIRIC SAGA -------------------------------

Another two part demoscreen, starting with in the upperpart an OVR logo.
In the middle of the screen are a load of bouching balls in a row.
The lowpart reveals some textblocks appearing/disappearing.

On to the second part of things,

The upperpart has a scrolline...........
The midpart has a horizontal starfield with a bouching(and more)scrolline
made of balls.
Underneath this scrolline is an oldfashion disting Overlanders logo.
I believe that there is also some (oldfashion) chipmusic.

 
Boooring.........

-------------------------------- HYSTANDERS --------------------------------

This screen contains a fullscreen picture with a scrolline and a logo saying
Hystanders in the lower and upper border.
After a while the whole screen begins to slide up and down and this is all
accompagnied by chipmuzak.

The picture is rather cool and also the sliding effect looks nice.

The second part contains a big starfield that uses the left and right border.
In the middle of the screen is box with text that behaves like a slidepuzzle.
You can find in this screen also some chipmuzak.

----------------------------------- EVIL ------------------------------------

A digidrum music starts and a big skull with hands on both sides appears on
screen.
Beneath this skull is the word "EVIL" and then there is the scrolline made
of dots, moving by in all kind of waveforms.
Later on in the show the big red "EVIL" logo will distort.

Nice graphics, old stuff !

------------------------------ BOARD AND SPHERES ----------------------------

Here's another hard-to-explain-kind-of-demoscreen but this time it's created
by Naos.
The whole things starts of with a white screen with in the middle the Naos
logo !
After this screen the real fun starts with a grid filled landscape that
slides in several directions (something like the TLB screens in Mindbomb).
Above the landscape is a nice colored background that slides up and even
changes from time till time.
Then there are these two spheres made of dots that move over the landscape.
In the upperpart you kan find a scrolltext, Naos seems to be using the borders
in this screen too.
As you all know a screen is never complete without some music, which is in
this case chipmuzak.

Very nice, but looks a lot like a TLB screen to me !

-------------------------------- BLESS THIS MESS ---------------------------

This guestscreen is done by ST Connexion and i believe that this screen was
made for the Dreamdemo, but that demo never saw the light of day.
The intro screen contains a very good drawn rat in clothes (looks like 
something out of a fairy-tale).
You also find the credits in this screen, after this screen is piccy of a
lying alien of some sort with some words of dedication to someone.

The main screen contains(in the upperpart) some roll text and a giant ( well
drawn font) scrolline that uses both left and right border.
In this screen is ofcourse also some music, chip i believe.

It's an old screen that would have been very good some years ago.

------------------------------- THE ULTIMATE DIST ---------------------------

The last guestscreen, this one is made by Pulsion.
First we get a piccy, it's a  hand with the Pulsion logo in it.

You have to use the mouse to get to the next part, which is a fullscreen
diagonal picture distorter.
In the upper border is the Pulsion logo with underneath it a small scrolline.
This screen uses hardscroll and contains chipmusic.

The second part of the demoscreen are a lot of shadebobs making all kind of
waves and figures.
When you leave this screen you will see again a nice picture.

One of the many fullscreen distorters, i think that we had them all now, 
from horizontal till vertical.

--------------------------------- THE GREETINGS ----------------------------

First you have to wait a bit,

But finally a module starts playing and then we get a parallax vertical 
scrolling background + bigscroller.
The background is distorted and after a while the bigscroller changes to
vertical scrolling textlines which contain a lot of greetings.

One of the better screens in this megademo !

--------------------------------- AUTODEMO MODE ----------------------------

This option shows you all the demoscreens automatically for half a minute or
so !

--------------------------------- THE RESET DEMO ----------------------------

Now this one is really hard to explain,

It has a scrolline in the lowpart and there is a big OVR logo rotating in
the middle of things.
After some time the OVR logo changes in other objects, this screens looks 
like a "led" screen.
There is also a module playing to brighten things up a bit.

Hmmmmmmm

---------------------------------- CONCLUSION ------------------------------

As you already can read in this review, the demo contains lots of old stuff
and looks like something from a distant past.
This is not the way to keep the name of the Union high (it's supposed to be
a united group of elite democoders in my eyes, but hey)but on the other side 
it's a pitty to throw away the old screens.

I give it some normal figures for old times sake,

CODE        : 7+
GRAPHICS    : 7+
SOUND       : 8- ( for the music made by the Millenium Bros. )

OVERALL     : 7  ( Would have been easy a 8+ two years ago ) 

To Overlanders: I hope that you talented guys bring out a nice designd stuff
                soon, i hear that you working on it but do you also finish it
                in time too ?
