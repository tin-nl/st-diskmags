    At last, pool  phreaks  can  stop  fawning  over Jimmy Whites
    Wirlwind Snooker, Archer has arrived to save us...

    During this text Archer  Mclains  3d  Pool  is  refered to as
    Pool, and JWWS is refered to  as Snooker.  The real games are
    refered to as pool, and snooker. (Note the capital!)

    Pool uses the same basic set  of controls and graphics engine
    as Snooker (why change something that works okay?), and apart
    from a few very small  changes  they  are identical.   So, as
    long as you are familiar with the rules of pool you can jump
    straight in, if you  are  not  conversent  with the basics of
    pool, well,  it's  an  easy  game  to  play  and  the  (quite
    substantial) manual has  the  full  rules  for  the different
    types of pool included.

    What?  You didn't realise  there  are different variations of
    pool?  Well, that's excusable I  suppose, after all there are
    plenty of different variations, although  Pool only has three
    different variations included.  (Surly three is enough, after
    all, there is only one version of snooker.)

    Pool has the following sets  of  rules, English bar, American
    bar, and American tournerment variations.  To explain all the
    differences between these three types  would  give me a major
    head-ache, however, the  most  obvious  difference  is in the
    layout of balls.  English and American  bar rules both have a
    triangle formation, similar to snooker, with a 50/50 split of
    red/yellow balls, not forgeting the black. Where as, American
    tournerment  rules  have  a  diamond  shape  of  sequentially
    numbered spot/stripe balls.

    As I mentioned, the graphics are  the same, well, that's true
    for the 3d system,  but  if  you've  seen Snooker you'll know
    about the different faces the balls pull.  In Pool, there are
    some new faces for the balls to pull, and there is also a new
    "gag".  When you have a  view  of  the  table, and there is a
    large area of blackness,  pairs  of  eyes  start apearing and
    looking at you.  So, the jokes  (the flies are still in), add
    nothing to the actual game  play,  but it's refreshing to see
    an auther with the sence of humor to include such things.

    It is as easy to  play  Pool  as  it  is to play Snooker, and
    becuase pool is a much quicker  and more accessable game than
    snnoker, it provides more  enjoyment.  (For me atleast.)  The
    only problem is, I keep on  getting  the eurge to go and play
    pool for real. (If that isn't high praise for a game, I don't
    know what is.)

    fIN.
