            Multi demos-tests  (between 1991/1992)
            -----------------       (PART 1)
            by Exec-U of Zuul
            -----------------
        
-WHAT HAVE WE DONE ON 1 YEAR OF WORK ?
  -COULD WE BE PROUD OF THAT ?
  
                   (no special order to test)


          Just Buggin' (ACF) -1 disk-
          ------------------
ACF strikes back with this super-production ,one year after their
Bloodsucker demo ! The Just Buggin' is surely the demo with the
nicest and original graphixs and muzaks ! With many very nice
screens ,the nicest main menu and two guests ,you have to get 
this work who is so wonderful !!! Congratulations guys !         

-Overall : 92%


          Delirious demo 4 (MCS) -2 disks-
          ----------------------
After a time ,MCS comes back with a new brain blasting (?)
production... In fact the DD4 is just another demo using some
STE'capacities but without the soundtrackers i think that all
the screens could be made on STF (almost everyones).
Anyway the DD4 takes again some nice stuff who do the best
megademos ! But ,there is a problem with this demo... MCS has
of course some very good coders and gfx man but there is
something missing in this demo ! In my opinion MCS has released
the demo one year too late !

-Overall : 79%


          Grotesque demo (Omega) -1 disks-
          ----------------------
Another 'come back' ,but this time those swedish pioneers bring
us an 'house' demo ! We can recognize the lordly of The Lost boys
in their 'Wot a Scorcher'. Grotesque is not really 'grotesque' 
coz it is the nicest techno-demo ever made on st ! What a pitty 
that the soundtrack is not as nice as the rest !
Still waiting for your others productions ,cheers !

-Overall : 77%


          M-demo 4 (An Cool of The Carebears) -2 disks-
          -----------------------------------
Ok i think that everyone knows this demo ,An Cool (the 'As nice
coders as bad graphist') releases his music demo 4 (4 ?) with the
usual nice effects and two little games (a Tron very funny and a
Pong not bad but the Pong of Nic (fun Vision) is really better !)
Nice sound ,good gfx and pretty nice code for a good techno-demo.
Ok boy the 5th please !

-Overall : 75%


          Punish your Machine (Delta Force) -2 disks-
          ---------------------------------
One of the more populare demos was made by Delta Force ,a great
mega demo that some people call 'Union 2' but i think it's not
really correct just becoz it could be a murder to release an
Union demo 2 ! Don't remove the classics !
So ,The Punish is composed of beautiful screens by Delta Force
and lotsa good and less good guest-screens.
Maybe one of the nicest megademo in the 'TOP 10' !!!

-Overall : 93%


          Relapse (The Cybernetics) -3 disks-
          -------------------------
Ach ! 3 disks ! Not a really good idea men ! Anyway the Relapse
demo brings you a lot of magnificient gfx with gigagreat and
original soundtracks ! But unfortunately the code is not really
great ! With a so nice intro (3D ,Dune'digits ans fabulous song)
and so nice gfx and sound ,we hoped a better demo ! It is such
a great pity that 90% of the work was slapdashed by a medium
codeing ! And there was the same problem with their first demo !
But warning ! I've never said that the coders are bad or anything
like that but they didn't use then their talent !!!

-Overall : 71%


          Town and country (T&C) (Impact) -2 disks-
          -------------------------------
Helllloooo Ayoros ,it is really difficult to test a demo from one
of my best friend on ST and as we have done a screen for this
demo ,it's so much more difficult ! 
Anyway your demo (who bugs on STF and Mega STE 2&4) is (for those
who have an STE) a nice exemple for the stereo quality of the STE
with some nice screens but not really revolutionary ! The best
screen is ,for me ,the 'Techno screen' with 2 little dancers and
the nicest house soundtrack i've never heard ! Good work but
shitty system to recognize the STE/STF and 512ko/1mo and really
awfull protection !!!

-Overall : 70%


          If pigs could fly (The Syndicate) -1 disk-
          ---------------------------------
Ok ,no problem with this one ,it's a multi part demo (like a
really big dentro) using the usual new effects (3D + fractales
+ Starfield ,etc) and 2 new soundchip musics absolutely wonderful
This demo is certainly one of the best multi part demo on ST !

-Overall : 82%


          Phaleon (Next) -4 disks-
          --------------
Here we are with the biggest production ever ! We've waited this
demo for almost 2 years and now we get it ! But what's the result
of a so big work ? The same problem that our NTM megademo coz
a lot of screens are very very old ! But some screens are very
wonderful ,as Next'screens ,Krom ,Mystic ,Chaotic motion and of
course the Shadow and Dungeon'main menus !
Four disks for a total of +- 45 screens in all ! A very nice and
big work even if 2/3 of the screens are too much old !!!

-Overall : 86%


          Network Terminal Manager (Zuul) -2 disks-
          -------------------------------
What ! He's gonna test his own demo ? He will certainly say that
it is the best one... No ! But i would like to say something...
The NTM had to be released in the end of 1990 and beginning of 91
but we had a lot of different and difficult problems to release
it at the good time ! So time passes and nice demos went out ,
finally the NTM goes out but 1 year and halve too late !
And i would like to say to Delta Force ,when they said they had
to be honest by putting 3/10 for this megademo ,i wonder some
questions ! Everyones are not you men !!!
Anyway when you're reading those lines ,our new multi-part demo
will be out yet ! Her name is -Lame Trop- ! Get it for fun.
PS: Have you found the two hidden screens of the NTM ?

-Overall : not me to judge !


          O-demo  (Oxygene) -1 disk-
          -----------------
1 year after their 'Genius' demo ,Oxygene is signing his best and
last production on ST ! The O demo is a standart megademo with
menu and doors to select the screens ! We can remark that Oxygene
has got one of the best Sprites'routine !
Nice gfx (like the intro ,the menu ,etc) ,nice code (like the
paralax ,STE screen ,sprites screen ,etc) and wonderful guest
screen by Mjj Prod !!! Quite usual but very intersting !

-Overall : 80%


          Nerd-House (Sentry) -1 disk-
          -------------------
Another house demo ,also called 'Nuthouse revenge' ,but the nerd
is not as nerd as the other one is nuts (do you follow me ?) ,i
just want to say that the Nerd-House from Sentry is absolutely
not better than the Nut-House by TNM (Nuthouse Makers). No ,becoz
after a nice intro and before a nice end-text ,we have the -so
called- house demo ! And after two 'Yeah' and two colors flashing
we are really bored ! I had the Grotesque by Omega and now this
one... Hmmm no sorry there is a little problem somewhere !
I return to Ultima Underworld... (it bears no relations with that
 ,i know !).
 
-Overall : 64%


          Mathematics sckizophrenes (Dune) -1 disk-
          --------------------------------
Another multi-part demo but this one brings no new stuff appart
from outsiding pictures from Mic (nice gfx-man) and great sound.
The demo begins with nice logos and nice song and after ,there is
a little 3D routine and little points routine (too long !) and
that's unfortunately all ! The demo could be better if there were
more screens !!! I think that there is the same problem that the
'Relapse demo' : great graphs ,great musics and medium code !!!
God ! Use your talent to bring us new stuff ,nice to see and not
3D routine to show us that you're able to do that ,all the more
so Sine your 3D routine is very slow !!! You have talentuous
graphist and musician ! Search ideas with what you have !!!!!

-Overall : 63%


          Pandemonium (Chaos) -1 disk-
          -------------------
Ok let's go ahead with this production... Chaos ,mmm what's that?
Oh yes Chaos of Delta force ! NO ! heu... Chaos inc then ? No !!!
Chaos ,the group ! Who are them and what's this demo ???
Let me introduce you...
The Pandemonium (or the corporation of daemons) is the first big
production by Chaos ,and they are really courageous to release
like that a new mega demo ! But fortunately the demo is really
great !!! And especially the 3D screen (with raytrace and Map)
who's certainly the best 3D screen on ST !
With other nice screens and good main menu ,this demo is very
wonderful !!! Get it !

-Overall : 86%


          No Cooper (1984) -1 disk-
          ----------------
Yack ! Yock ! Yuck ! I'm happy to see a demo with so nice effects
and so nice logos ! But may your musicain stay on Amiga becoz
his soundchip musics are very very lame and his soundtracks are
very nice !!! Tell me something... Your soundchips ? Are they
made in real time ? Ah ah ah ,hum sorry. No just kidding ,your
multi-part demo is really nice (great idea with the mirror and
snoopy !). Hope to see you soon again !!!

-Overall : 80%


          Massive Attack (Mad vision) -1 disk-
          ---------------------------
Another multi-part demo ,but this time by our greatest ennemies !
In two words ,becoz we don't want to do any pub for those lamers,
you can see 3D (thanks Equinox !!) and some others (ripped) stuff
not very original... We have lotsa laughed in front of the screen
with a 1 bitplane distort scroller (8 pixel i believe) soundtrack
(perhaps 0.5khz) and two plasma'lines (effect of radical rasters)
made with a picture of sixteen colors ,ah ah ah !!!
There is also a fabulous Ultima Underworld absolutely not bugged
AAAAAAAHHAAAAAAAAAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAAAAAAAAHAHAH !!!!!!!!
And to finish usual Equinox 3D routs !
Please children ,continue your games compils !
(NB : if you want a better test of this demo ,look in the DNT
Paper 4 !)

-Overall : With Equinox 3D'routs : 76%
-Overall : Without that : 32%


          Burning Illusion (DNT) -1 disk-
          ----------------------
Alliance between DNT (best coders in France for me) and Future
Minds...
Wow ! Very strong and very poor !!! This is a very big dentro
and much bigger than the 'My Socks' from Legacy... We start with
a fabulous DNT logo in a fabulous 3D ! After that ,DNT show us 
that they have gigagreat coders ! Indeed the multi-effects-demo
contains some stuff very HTC ! (Hard To Code ! You didn't know ?)
But unfortunately the different effects are boring and too much
long and the scroll text (16*16) is perhaps in step 2 !!!
What a pity boyz ! But do not cry becoz if you read the text ,the
genious DNT have included a system to skip the effects !
Appart from that ,the demo is on a very good 'level-code' !
Ps : why using a so old 'RSI' soundtrack ! There are more than
one thousand beautiful soundtracks on St !

-Overall : 81%


          Snork (Futur Minds) -2 disks-
          -------------------
After a not-too-bad coding party and a nice 'Anxiously waiting' 
demo ,Futur Minds and some others teams released the Snork demo.
A very good megademo with nice screens and nice ideas (the 
presentation is staggering !!!) from Mjj prod ,ULM ,TSK ,Futur 
Minds (of course) ,Zarathrusta ,DNT ,Art of codes (that's what 
i call an original screen !) ,Rave FM ,etc...
With a nice 3D menu ,the Snork is essential ! It's just such a 
shame that some screens are very old ,but the demo is still 
very nice !

-Overall : 82%


          Eat my bollocks (Equinox) -1 disk-
          -------------------------
We can also call it -All in one- becoz this multi part demo takes
again all the nicest effects on ST ! With some new stuff ,
fabulous gfx ,nice mad max musics and great ideas ,the 'Eat my
Bollocks' is just 'Zebest' ! this demo pulverizes all multi-parts
on ST ! Bye bye 'If pigs could fly' and others 'Burning Illusion' 
demos!
Perfect ! But is that 100% Equinox ? If yes :

-Overall : 94%


          Ooh Crickey ,wot a scorcher ! (The Lost Boys) -1 disk-
          ---------------------------------------------
I liked finish those lines with the megamighty Lost boys with
the mmmmooossstt beautiful megademo ever ! There is everything !
Wonderful code ,magnificient gfx ,amazing musics and great ideas
for what we can also call ZE BEST ! The 'Dark side of the spoon' 
has been beaten ! In french we could translate the name by 
something like that 'Oh putain quelle journee !' So we want a 
next scorcher like that !!!

-Overall : 97%



I know that there are other demos from 1991-1992 but it will be
in the Part 2 ,normaly in other DBA mag !
