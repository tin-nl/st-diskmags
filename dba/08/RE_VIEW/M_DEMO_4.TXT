| Music Demo 4 by AN Cool of The Carebears - Reviewed by BLOODANGEL/TNC |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Well here I am again! Thanx to Tronic for this demo (again!) this demo
is the latest offering from AN Cool (And you thought TCB were dead!) well
this demo is supposed to be a music demo, but this one comes on two disks,
has two games built in and a bob-record! Some music demo!! I really hope
that all the latest demos arrive soon! E.g.

- The Apathy demo by the B.B.C. (Some hope!)
- The demo by Dominion of Hotline
- The Synergy mega demo
- The Shock Therapy demo by Delta Force
- The Genetix demo by Inner Circle
- The TCB one!
- The Omega one!
- The Froggies over the Fence demo
- The Respectables one!
- The La Ventura demo by The Overlanders
- A Legacy one maybe?

Anyway, on with the review:

The Intro
---------

The intro starts off with some text telling you that poor old AN Cool is off 
to join the army for 10 months (Bad luck dude!) and that MPH (The sellers of
the -TCB Tracker-) have completely ripped him off and not given him any 
money. Then you hit the pub on the moon (Space bar! Geddit??!) and a really
cool heavy metal sample plays and the bionic lion from Wings of Death II 
leaps onto the screen and a logo at the bottom says 'M Demo 3+1' which tells
you that it is actually M-Demo 4! And I'm in the bottom set for maths !!!
Then a big AN Cool logo appears with a moving background in it appears and 
then a bouncing M DEMO 4 logo appears! A nice screen, really made for me 
by the wicked sample!!

The Loader
----------

This screen has some purple lines in the background and a font telling you
a bit about the screen and telling you how much it has to load. Two things
about this loader:
1. It crashes quite often (Well the demo was made in a rush...)
2. The music is a TCB Tracker thumpy-rave-hardcore-etc. track!

Hardware bobs
-------------

Some text appears (The Nighthawks font!) telling you that you are about
to see 1,3086 bobs. I have this feeling that AN Cool is doing some
precalculating!!!!!!! Finally all these bobs appear and look very nice
indeed with a distinct ray traced effect. Yet more excellant digi-music!

The 1st game - Lightcycles!
---------------------------

Yeah! EVERYONE has played this game before and it is always a good laugh
to beat your enemy by smashing him into a wall!! Fun!! Great musix too!!!

The Replicants Intro
--------------------

This screen was originally for the Replicants as an intro for a crack, but
somehow it entered into the M-Demo 4! Well it consists of 4 V.U. meters,
a bouncing 'Union' logo, a 64x32 scroller and some bouncing text in the
background, good for an intro! Yet more TCB Tracker musix!

Byte-Bender
-----------

This one consists of two blue byte benders, a moving TCB logo and some text
in the background. Okay, but this screen is the only one to have YM-2149F
chip musix in it, after all the digi-musix it comes as a bit of a let
down, but never fear because there is a lot more digi-tunes to listen to!

The Change-Disk screen
----------------------

This screen is just some tracker musix, two scrollers (Great font!) and
a 'DISK TWO' logo in the middle.

Mr. Spline
----------

Some very smooth splines, the usual controls (x-speed, y-speed etc.) and
some numbers at the bottom which are supposed to be V.U. meters... strange.

Pong!
-----

Pong with tracker musix... cool!

Altern-8
--------

Loads of stars, an ugly ALTERN-8 logo, excellant tracker musix and Wizball
sprites. Wicked musix!

The End Screen
--------------

Wierd bloke being killed and some greetinx text.
