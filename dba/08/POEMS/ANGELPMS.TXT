You and I
=========
What i try each time
You don't see me!

Each time again
if people see you go

I am walking in your foot-mark
You are so beautiful blond

What i hear from you
Make mine plea round

Everyone who knows
that i will kiss you

But they forget
is the different between

What you feel for me
And what i have meant



Lonely
++++++

Will i show you how i really am?
There are alot of things
what i don't say to you!
Nobody can read thoughts
So nobody knows me!
May be I am building meself a big
wall around me?
Is it that i will stand in my own way most?
for using would be " adjust behaviour"
To be silent is very expensive  
The toll will paid very much with pain
loneliness is my part
To affraid for a come-down!
Through norms what i have given
to me self


Rain
----

If it rains
It's seems like
the world is crying
everthing is even dreary and snarl
the only thing what's very nice
is that i love you
and you loves me
That makes the day happy again!

I know you are somewere
and thinking on me
And there's a moment
the sun is shining again
when i look outside
behind the curtains
The world is crying
tears with tingle


Plums
+++++

I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

And which
you were probably
saving
for breaksfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold
