MADMAN ( 92' RE-MIX )

Disneyland is the place to be, c'mon baby
just you and me;
Hand in hand, to Disneyland, we go ! Not slow;
Happiest place, in the world until a madman
grabs a girl;
Hand in hand, with the madman she goes, oh!oh!

Chorus:
Knife gleamin' no feelin's, axe wieldin', child stealin'
madman is loose...in Disneyland (in Disneyland)

Come here little girl if you wanna see,
Peter Pan's magic flight on L.S.D.
Up and down, all around, we go! Whoa oh!

Chorus:
Madman is loose in Disneyland;
He's back here by popular demand;
He'll take no lip but he he'll take your head!

Suprise, suprise, i'm comin' at ya' live;
I sure as hell ain't Mickey Mouse,
I'm a killer in disguise;
You can run, you can hide;
But you ain't gettin' away, cause i got you in
my sight;

Axe wieldin', child stealin';
I'm a mad mother, and i'm loose;

Have you heard the news, madman sure is loose;
Got you by the noose, have his way with you;
Nothin' you can do, headlines in the news;
Madman sure is loose, in Disneyland.

Disneyland is the place to be, in California,
by the sea;
Sunny day, well A.O.K., for now, and how;

Chorus

EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

I hate the rain and sunny weather,
and I, hate the beach and mountains too;
(and)I don't like the thing about the city, no, no
and I, I, I, hate the country side too!

and I, hate everything about you !
...everything about you !

I, don't like a thing about your mother,
and I, I hate your daddy's guts too,
I, don't like the thing about your sister no, no
cause I, I, I, think sex is overrated too.

Chorus:

and I get sick when I'm around, I, can't stand to be
around,
I, hate everything about you !
everthing about you, everything about you, everything
about you

Bridge:
Some say I got a bad attitude,
but that don't change the way I feel about you,
if you think all this might be bringing me down,
look again cause I ain't wearin' no frown !

Solo:

I don't really care about your sister
forget the little bitch 'cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe
I know you know everybody knows
the way it comes, the way it goes
you think it's sad well that's to bad
'cause I'm havin' a ball and never cared a thing about
you

Everything about you, everything about you
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you

GODDAMN DEVIL

Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery
These are the things that will bring you to me
Murder and theft and all the above 
You can bet your life I know what you're thinkin' of
I've takin' you and I'll take your friends
Don't you worry, we'll all meet in the end
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Thrust me baby cause I don't lie

I'm the Goddamn Devil, this job pleases me
I'm the Goddamn Devil and I do it for free

I know the story about your life
If you killed your brother or you beat your wife
And I am here to punisch you
You can't fool me cause I ain't no fool

The time has come to say goodbye
The end is here for those who cheat, steal and lie
There will be torture and there will be pain
Cause this is hell, baby, die in flames.

I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, Satan if you please
I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, and i do it for free

I don't care about you, don't care about your life
Don't care about your children or about your wife
I'm here to do my job so if you broke the law
You're checkin' in with me
But you can never leave...

There's one way out if you dare
We'll make a deal, you'll grow your hair
As Satan's child you'll start a band
And spread the word across the land


I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, satan if you please
I'm the goddamn devil, better believe in me
I'm the goddamn devil !
