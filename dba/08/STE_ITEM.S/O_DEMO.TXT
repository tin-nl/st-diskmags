THE O-DEMO

Yo! Welcome to this review  of  the  brand  new  demo by OXYGENE. Yep,
OXYGENE is the group that  made  the quite well-known GENIUS-DEMO. And
this O-DEMO is their last demo on ST/E.

The whole demo  is  like  a  traditional  megademo.  The introduction,
loader, main-menu, guest part and reset-screen are all there. The only
thing that separates this from  an  ordinary  megademo is the quality:
Every bit in this demo is finished  well. Nothing new is invented, but
all old ideas are  done  perfectly.  Graphics  are  superior in almost
every screen, and couple of screens even play a soundtracker-music.

I liked very much OXYGENE's GENIUS, but I didn't consider OXYGENE as a
famous demo-crew. But this O-DEMO  should  lift OXYGENE to every demo-
charts on ST-scene. And it will do it...

The guest-part is made  by  MJJ  PROD.  I  have  seen  couple of their
earlier demos and to tell you the  truth  I didn't expect this kind of
contribution by them. Their screen is a multipart and it is so fuckin'
cool, that you won't believe it before you see it.

Also an STE-screen was included,  but  I didn't notice any differences
between it and the STF-screens. I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't so
amazing either.

If you haven't got this demo yet, you can be sure that you have missed
something. So get it immediately or be doomed! And let's all pray that
OXYGENE will make another demo on ST...
