SINFUL SINUSES

              A review of the latest production by CHRONICLE
              ----------------------------------------------

This demo is only a one  file  (about  100kb),  and it can be found on
nearly every demo-CD's. This may also be the reason why no-one has not
reviewed Sinful Sinuses before: it  is  so  small  (if you look at the
size that it takes from disk)...

Well, the file-size just don't make justice to this demo, I wonder how
someone has managed to do such  cool  demo  in  100kb. But you did it,
Creator! So congratulations to you!!!

The whole demo starts with a  sinusing  dots-flag. I haven't count the
dots, but  there  are  many  of  them  and  they  are  in  two planes.
Amazing...

Hmm... there are so many parts, that  I'm not gonna tell you screen by
screen what is going on, but let's take  a look at the effects of this
demo:                   - Sinus-dots
                        - Big sinus-scrollers
                        - 4-pixel RGB-plasma
                        - Nice bobs
                        - Big sinus-text-displayer
There are also a couple of  other  effects,  but  let's save them as a
surprise...

The graphics and sound are  good.  And  what  I  really think is worth
mentioning is the fact, that neither the gfx nor sound is ripped. That
is good, because I just  can't  stand  to  hear the old Mad Max -songs
anymore...

P.S. This is a good demo to show to your stupid Amiga-friends...
     I showed this to one of my friends (He has seen the vectors
     by KRUZ, and he has said: "No problem I can do them twice as
     fast on my Amiga.") and he was totally impressed... Now after
     couple of months coding, he still hasn't reached the quality
     of CREATOR... How sad life can be... Har har...
