NO BORDERS

Do you also hate those fucking borders?  Well, with this little routine
you can remove the borders in STOS basic.  First the source, and after
that a little explanation for those who wants to.

10  wait vbl : for T= 0 to 242 : next T : poke $FF820A,0 :
    poke $FF820A,2 : if peek ($FFFCo2) <> 57 then goto 10


That's all!!! Now a little explanation:

1  Wait until the last scanline on the screen;
2  change Herz;
3  wait a bit;
4  change back again.

Note: this routine needs a lot of processor time, so don't try to make
      a big demoscreen with modules etc. on the STf with this routine !!
      If you made something nice with this or another source in one of
      the STOS corners, send it to D.B.A. magazine and maybe other people
      can learn of it.
