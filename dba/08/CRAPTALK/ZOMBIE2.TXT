                    ATTACK OF MUNTANT ZOMBIES PART 2

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 20 minutes they have loaded the truck with the stuff and we left the
terrain of the militairy supply depot.
I orderd the soldier to drive to the place where Nick left his car, when we
arrived Nick was already waiting for me.
The soldier begins to get suspicious, so i stick my gun under his nose and
order him to get out, his eyes are totally focused on the gun.
The soldier never saw the branch that Nick held behind his back.........

We put the unconscious soldier in the bushes and Nick takes place behind
the steer (hey, i can't drive).
The evening begins to fall when we arrive in Drachten.

All the others have also completed their tasks, Peter and Frank are busy
outside hanging up some camera's when we arrive at the supermarket.
When they see us, they run to the truck and start to unload it right away.
More men arrive and help with the unloading, they are recruited to help us
out.
(Peter:)Thank god, you two made it !
(Frank:)How was your trip, did you get the stuff easy ?
I start to tell what happend at the depot, while Nick helps Peter with a
big box containing a Mach.

Then Katy comes running towards me, she says, i was busy inside unpacking
some medical kits when i heard the sound of a truck !
She puts her arms around me and wispers in my ear, i'm so happy that your 
back in one piece.
(Frank:)Hum, sorry to intrude but can you help carry these boxes with ammo ?
(Me:)Sorry, Katy but i have to help him first, we can talk a bit later.
Okay she says, i will continue with my medical kits, see ya later....

When everything is brought inside, the guys begin to open the boxes.
(Peter:)Wow, this is heavy stuff ( after opening a box containing a Mach. ).
(Frank:)Yeah, man we can stop a complete army with this kind of heavy metal.
(Me:)I'm happy you like it but wait till you see the flamethrowers......
(Frank:)Yeeh man, nice going, we've got pleny of gaseline to fry those turkeys
till they turn all black and crispy.
I recruited some guys who really know to handle these things pretty well !
(Me:)How many extra men do we got running around here anyway ?
10 or so answers Frank and they are mostly reserves that didn't react on
the summons on the radio and some of them are friends of me and Peter.

---
The supermarket is just one (ground)floor and has no storeys.
There are two entrances and several doors at the back of the building for
the supply's and the personnel.
All the doors at the back are locked and sealed of with planks and pieces
of cupboard, there are only 4 tiny windows free to shoot through.
7 survilance camera's are on the inside and 4 are on the outside of the
supermarket to keep an eye on things.
---

The weapons get spread under the men and the ammo gets stored in two different
places in the supermarket.
(Me:)Keeping the zombies out will be peanuts but i think that we will have
to deal with gangs that come to rob the food.
(Peter:)Yes, probably.

The night falls, two men are awake to check to monitors, while the rest of
group are trying to sleep.
When everybody wakes up in the morning there is still no trace of zombies.
All men are working on the last fortifications of the supermarket by placing
2 heavy Mach guns on the roof of the supermarket and sealing of some big
windows with planks.
Katy is checking the radio, all German stations are gone but most dutch 
stations are still broadcasting.
We hear story's about the Dutch army putting up a hell of a fight, but they
start to drop further back.

A journalist reports, thousands and thousands of zombies are coming towards 
the dutch borders.
Many soldiers are biten by the creatures (that you hardly can call human 
anymore) and they started shooting at there fellow humans.
After a hour or so they suddenly drop there weapons and turn completly into
zombies.

Katy is quite upset about wat she hears and i try to calm her a bit.
Later on that day more and more dutch radio stations disappear and we hear
strange noises on some of them.
The same journalist we heard earlier that day reports that zombies are 
entering the studio, the last thing we've heard was a loud scream.

The men begin to get a bit nervous, so we turn the radio off.
It's still quiet outside but after a while we hear the sound of screaming
coming from the city around us.
We also hear the sound of gunfire from police and army that try and stop
the waves of zombies coming from Germany.
It will probably take only a couple of hours till most parts of the
Netherlands are taken as well.

****************

Things begin to look desperate at the NAVO base in Germany.
We begin to run out of food and ammo reports a sergeant to the general.
There are several casualties and the first zombies are on the terrain, the
men are retreating to the barraks.
Some of the soldiers from the shooting that where brought to the labratory
are also biten and they are also on the lose.
Stop them at any cost, orders the general, we have to hold till the antidote
is finished.
America has decided to send no troops to Europe, they have sealed of the
whole country and let no foreigners in to prefend contamination.
Without the help of the U.S.A. it's all up to us, there are still many lives
at stake here !

The general takes a gun and puts a helmet on his head, lets go soldier....

****************

Sounds of gunfire and screaming fill most of the day and night.
The next morning it is very quiet, the gunfire has stopped and we hear no 
sound of screams anymore.
(Frank:)It's to quiet for my taste out there !
(Peter:)Yes your right, lets take our postitions.

Some men go to the roof and other take positions behind some tiny windows.
At the end of the morning i hear one of the men yelling on the roof.
I climb up the ladder that leads to a hole in the sealing, when i wriggle
trough the hole i get on the roof.
One of the three guys on the roof hands me his glasses and tells me to look
at the end of the parking-place that is situated in front of the supermarket.
Between some cars i spot some people that seem to walk there without any
purpose.
When i take a closer look i notice that they all have head wounds and are
covered in blood.
The guy from the glasses says, it's impossible that those people can walk
around with those wounds, these must be zombies !
Yes, i say, those are definitly zombies, keep your eyes wide open but don't
start shooting, we don't want to draw attention to ourselfs !

I get back to the guys and girl below to tell them what i saw.
(Peter:)yo man, the show begins, well it's better then waiting for it.
He is sitting together with Katy infront of the monitors.
(Nick:)Waiting is always the worst part of a fight, anyway i think it's
about time that we lower the panels for the main-doors.
He presses the buttons on the control-board and the panels begin to lower
them selves very slowly.
The supermarket gets dark inside when the panels block the sunlight that
was coming trough the glass doors.
(Me:)Say Peter, did you place mines outside ?
(Peter:)Yeah, i let some of the men place some mines at blind spots near the 
supermarket that we can not see from the inside.

One of the man on the roof is climbing down the ladder, he looks rather 
nervous.
Hey guys, the parking place is filling up with zombies now, they must have 
noticed us !
(Me:)How's that possible, they must have seen you on the roof !
No way man, it's like they smell us or something.......
(Me:)Get back on that roof and keep your eyes peeled, report if there are
further changes in the situation.

-----
Several hours passes and there are hundreds of zombies gathering on the 
big parking place.
The situation becomes very tense as they slowly start walking towards the
supermarket.
I decide to devide the men in to several small groups.
-----

(Me:) Nick you and a few man defend the backside and Frank and his men take
both sides of the supermarket.
I will take care of the front and the rooftop, Katy will keep us informed
about what she see's on the monitors.
She will use the PA system or intercom to warn us, Peter and one man will
supply ammo, food and other things that might be needed.
They also will give extra backup when necessary !

The first zombies have reached the front supermarket and they are pressing 
against the panels.
I let them because they never come through them anyway, i'm only worried when
they try the backside or the small windows on both sides of the building.
Time passes......

****************

More and more European country's get overrun by zombie's, there is no stopping
them anymore.
In the U.S., president Clinton has taken the decision to nuke big parts
of Europe.
It's the only way to save the rest of the world from the zombie's.
He has tears in his eyes when he pushes the button.......

****************

More and more zombies begin to press against the panels and after a while
they see it's useless and they start searching for another intrance.
Frank orders his men to fire at the first zombies that appear on both sides
of the supermarket.
Frank starts shooting at a zombie that comes towards his window, it's a
older man with a ugly looking head wound.
Bang, bang, the old man gets hit in his chest and drops on the ground.
But after a few seconds he gets up again, blood is running from the wounds
in his chest but it doesn't seem to bother him at all.
What the F**k is this yells Frank, i have shot the bloody creature right in
his chest but it even't blinked a eye.
Lets give it another round.......this time the zombie doesn't even fall but
keeps walking towards the window.
Blood is running from several bullet holes in his chest.

Man, this scary stu.. yells another man, but before the man can continue his
sentence he gets grabed by a fat and ugly female with bite wounds all over
her face.
The zombie has grabed him right through the window and it tries to pull him
outside.
The man struggles to get free but the fat female zombie is much to strong,
his uzi falls on the floor.
One of the other men starts pulling on the victim to prefend that he gets
pulled trough the window.
Frank is occupied with the old man, he shoots another round but this time in
the head of the zombie.
The zombie goes down after taking another round in the head and stays down.
That's it yells Frank, you can kill the bloody creatures by shooting it in
the head !

In the struggle to get free the victim tries to get his gun that he carries
under his belt.
Blood is coming from his shoulder where the fat female zombie holds him tight
with a firm grip, the victim is hanging half outside the window now.
His friend is pulling on his legs but it's no use because the zombie is 
stronger.
The fat zombie opens it's moulth and brings her head towards the throth of
the poor guy.
But before the fat woman can bite he throws his gun in her moulth and
pulls the trigger.
Boam !!, blood and parts of her brains are all over the place, the woman
loses her grip on the victim and grabs her head.
She has a big hole in the back of her head, her eyes go wide open and she 
looks astonished when she see's all the blood on her hands.
Boam !! The victim pulls the trigger once again and the zombie drops on the
ground.

Quickly he gets pulled back through the open window by his friend.
Pffff, that was a close one, we must give you some medical attention first
and warn the other to shoot the zombies in the head to kill them.
His friend calls for help over the intercom and reports about the incident.
A few seconds later Katy her voice sounds over the PA system with the warning
to shoot the zombies in the head to kill them.
Peter and his compagnon take care of the shoulder of the victim while the
shooting continues as more and more zombies come towards the windows.

****************

The NAVO base is on the point to be completly overrun by hunderds of zombies.
One of the officers is reporting to the general,
All zombies on the terrain are terminated now, but the ones by the gate and
fences are getting dangerous, sir.

General, we're almost out of ammo, says one of the soldiers.
The fences are starting to fold and the first zombies are coming on the  
terrain.
The general orders all militairy to regroup at the labratory because the
faith of mankind depends on the antidote of the doctor.

****************

At the supermarket things are going to be very tense, the zombie's are coming
from all directions now.
Hundreds of zombies are pressing against the panels but the panels still
won't budge !
Then suddenly the camera's go black, the PA system and intercom are both
down.
There is no power anymore in the supermarket says Katy, yeah this was bound
to happen, it's time to start the power generators says Peter.

****************

The Navo base in Germany is now completly overrun by the zombies.
Several soldiers are trying to flee but it is no use.
Some of the soldiers and the general are in the labratory when the first
creatures come through the doors and windows.

The general has no ammo anymore and he tries to keep the zombies away with
a piece of wood.
It's no use, the last thing he could do is scream while the zombie's bite
in his head.
Doctor X has locked himself up in a small room with only a door, he knows
that he will also die.

****************

When the evening falls things become even harder as the zombies become more
and more aggresive.
The back doors begin to break and the first zombies enter the supermarket..


THEN A BIG FLASH SETS THE WHOLE AREA IN A BRIGHT LIGHT, A BIG MUSHROOM CLOUD
IS RISING ABOVE THE CITY.

Several nuclear warheads have been dropped on country's in Europe, the next
horror story begins............
