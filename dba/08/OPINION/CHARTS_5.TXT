                           The All-Time Top 5 Games
                           ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

 The other day, whilst I was staring out of the window during a particularly
boring Chemistry lesson, an idea hit me. I had seen a list of a magazines top
50 all time games and I disagreed with them on many of the choices. So I 
thought, why not compile my own! I dug out my rough book and started jotting
down some likely top 10 contenders. I then preceeded to knock up an all-time
top 10 list of games. I decided to get the views of some other people, so I 
asked the other members of The M.L.P to do theirs and also a few of my other
friends who were interested. Considering we all like Kick Off 2, I thought it
would definately take the no.1 spot. Unfortunately, I had not counted on 
Sensible Soccer!  I personally hate the game (The goalies are so cack!). 
Anyway, I have sent in this article so that everyone who reads it can make
their opinion on our all-time top 5 games.
Firstly, I will put the top 10's of everyone I asked and then explain how 
we compiled the final 5.  Let's go then...
