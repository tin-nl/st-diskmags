Well it had to happen.  Another (well-known) crew has packed in !!  As
I, MUG U.K(tm), write this obituary column, myself and JJF (the only two 
remaining and active members of The Source) are busy winding up the group.

This means finishing off and releasing the menus upto and including 125.
They will probably be ready by the time this issue is released, but this
is the best way for the rest of the 'scene' to read about the death of
The Source !!


The Players and their future ....
---------------------------------

Speed is having too much fun getting pissed at college in Sheffield and he
has moved on to the Amiga.  Maybe he'll do something similar on that machine,
who knows ?  He has also packed up his PD Library, so don't bother writing
to him anymore for Atari ST PD !!


Egon is also busy (getting pissed?) at college and although I never knew you
to talk to or swap with, I wish you all the best as well.


Mr.X (of Prophecy PD) came back from America last September and wanted to
get back straight away.  No-one has heard from him since he got back and
apparently Prophecy PD has disappeared as well.  If this information is
wrong, then I apologise, but Mr.X hasn't been in contact with either JJF
or myself since September 1992 !!


Frosty was a member up until somewhere in the 60's - 70's but he left before
I joined.  Having seen him since, he's having fun and that is all that
really matters - if you have a modem, you should be able to find him !!
(If you're reading this now Frosty, can you get in touch with me (MUG)
 about some help you can offer me !!)


Thrud is someone else who I never had any contact with, but he did a few
'guest' menus, so he deserves some mention in this column.  I've no idea
what he is going to do, but I'm sure it'll be worth it !!


JJF is working on a database of ALL the articles published on paper/disk
magazines concerning GFA BASIC.  A mighty task, but one that no-one has
attempted before (that I know of).  From the preview versions that I've
seen - it looks brilliant and very handy to have on your hard-drive !!


I (MUG U.K) am busy with lots of things.  Towards the end of The Source,
I was helping to develop a link-file routine (GEMDOS-based) to enable demos
to be packed just that little bit smaller - especially in the cluster
size.  Some examples were released on Menu 120 if you want to have a nosey
at them !!  My partner in crime is MSD of POV (who does the majority of the
68000 work) and we MAY be selling it soon, but more details may be found
in this issue of The DBA Magazine or the next.  Look around !!  I also have
plenty of other projects lined up - including the continuation of my GFA
programming (?) section in this magazine !!


IWWWTTI, as some of you already know, is MUG U.K(tm) !!  OK, I admit it,
I like having lots of pseudonyms !!  "I Wonder Who Wrote This Trash
Industries" was a name that I could use on certain projects of mine - like
the 'Complete Idiots Guide To Lump-packing (found on Source Menu 82)'.  
It was also used to counter-act the twittering voices that might (and would)
say, "See that MUG U.K - he's a pirate !!  He does naughty TRAP #1 loaders
for a certain 'person'".  It was all a ruse, not only could the 'person' in
question, could not hack his way out of a paper bag, but he couldn't adapt
any TRAP #1 loader to save his life !  My adaption of the Pompey Pirates
executable file header for every new packer released was used continually
by this 'person' to brag about how he had cracked this and that when it
was well known that he'd ripped off someone elses crack !!

Everyone has their dreams and aspirations and everyone, at one time or
another, enacts these dreams (I know I have!) but this person lived (and
probably still lives) a Walter Mitty existence all the time !!  He would
tell you one thing and tell someone else something completely different,
even though it was the same subject he was talking about !!  Two-faced and
back-stabbing are words frequently used (along with many others) to describe
this ...... person !!

Not that I'm giving anything away, but for the more unfortunate people out
there who can't guess who I am on about, read Amazine and you should be
able to work it out !

I must say here and now that I am NOT a pirate.  What I was once (and many
moons ago it was) was then.  It is my past and it STAYS there !!  I can
guarantee that there isn't a single pirated copy of any cracked software
in my house.  

A lot of the information above was gathered on a personal basis and also 
from the totally un-biased information (?) that can be found in-between 
the swear words in Amazine #1 & #2 !!

Anyway, I digress, this is supposed to be an obituary column for The Source
and not for this person under scrutiny, although he's left the ST scene - 
apparently ???


An Overview - Albeit A Short One !
----------------------------------

Well, 125 menus - not bad going for a demo compilation group !!  I have no
idea what the statistics are, but that is a fair few amount of demos packed
onto 125 disks.  Not only were there demos, but the odd game (some of them
possessed trainer modes done by me !!), soundtracker modules, music rips
utilities and other disk-filling type things were sometimes thrown onto the
disk when space was left.  On the other hand, they were a few menus (always
the ones I did though) that were so full that the menu was contained on
the bootsector !!  The odd thing is that we survived longer than a lot of the
the 'game packing' groups !!

I joined the group around Menu 80-ish and I'm glad I did.  I learnt a lot more
about packers, 68000 and other subjects that are a must in order for you to
pack stuff that bit better (and survive longer ?) than the other groups.

This leaves only two demo packing groups, that I know of, who have survived
into the 100's.  They are, Persistence Of Vision and Ripped Off.  I hope that
these groups survive as there isn't anything within range !!  So go to it
POV (MSD/Ozzy/Boris) and Ripped Off (Bilbo/Stick) - give 'em hell !!

The funny thing is - we never did manage to release Menu 100 !!  It was 
promised by a certain person mentioned a few paragraphs previous but as with
a lot of the things he said he'd do - nothing ever came of it.

Greets to all the other demo packing groups that make it past 50 or 100 !!  
That includes Animal Mine & STAX, and other quality groups like these.

I'd also like to thank all the authors of the demos, modules, chip-music,
games and utilities that were packed and released onto The Source menus.
If it wasn't for your creative talents, there wouldn't of been anything to
pack (and yes, that includes the really shit demos as well !!).


The End ........ ?
------------------

To all the contacts of JJF and MUG U.K(tm) - keep in touch, we are still
alive !!  New contacts are always welcome from around the world but we are
ONLY interested in legal software (no cracked stuff).  My address is at
the end of my GFA column.  I am especially interested in other demo-packers
who are GOOD at what they do, so they can teach me new tricks & tips !!

I'll hope to see you all on the Falcon !!
