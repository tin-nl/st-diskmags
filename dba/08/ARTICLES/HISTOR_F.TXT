HISTORY OF FLASH

It is now 19th of December  1992  and  I got a weird inspiration which
told me to look back in time and  then write down what has happened to
our crew. As I'm also a member of D.B.A. Magazine-team, I thought that
this would be also a good idea for an article...

So, here we go... I found FLASH in the beginning year 1991. There were
only three members at that time: EXECUTIONER (still an active member),
SANDMAN (It's me) and CREATOR (Nowadays he is a highly respected coder
of Chronicle).  We  weren't  so  active  (actually  we  did absolutely
nothing worth expressing in year 1991).

In year 1992 things began to change.  CREATOR had left the group (this
is our biggest loss), but many new members joined FLASH (sadly enough,
no coders at all).  EXTERMINATOR  (who  has  become  a good artist and
swapper), GOZER (musician who makes  90%  of our music), TOLKIEN (this
man has a real gift in drawing logos), OBSERVER (another musician) and
DRAGONSLAYER (musician and artist) became members of our crew...

Our first 'official' product was released in May 1992. It was FUN PACK
#1. People received it as a promising product of a new group. Nowadays
we have released 3 FUN PACKs, and there won't be more of them. Because
we didn't progress while doing  those intro-collections and because we
were always slower than our  more  experienced  friends in Germany, we
decided not to make more intro-packs.

We also released a couple of  intros,  but  there were nothing good in
them. The next step of  'progress'  was Enigmatic Obsession, which was
(and still is) a multi-part for  STE.  The quality was really bad, and
the code was totally shameful (even  for  my standards). The only not-
so-bad thing in EO was the music and some of the graphics...

At the beginning of the December we released our last production since
now. It is  PARALLAX  II.  It  is  a  sequel  for the PARALLAX-shintro
(shintro=shitty intro). It is also  our  first production, which isn't
so bad. It hasn't got  any  wonderful  code,  but everything looks and
sounds nice.

Now we are working with a sequel  to the Enigmatic Obsession. After it
is finished we'll do  a  music-disk  (but  that  will  be somewhere in
summer '93).

Oh, it was so refreshing  to  look  back  down  and  found out all the
stupid mistakes we had made. Hopefully we have learned something about
them... Before I stop, here is the official member-list of FLASH...

That was it! Hopefully you  enjoyed  reading  this  text. At least you
should now know what this group called FLASH WAS  about...
** Note the WAS word because Flash is dead now, RED. **

P.S. I forgot the nearly most important thing, which is a part of our
     group-history: I've been writing for DBA-Magazine since issue #2
     and I've seen it grow from  a  little baby to a giant, which now
     is one of the best disk-magazines around...
