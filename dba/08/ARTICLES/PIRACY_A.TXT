Hello, member of BASTARDS INTERNATIONAL. I saw your article in issue
#6 of DBA-magazine, and I totally agreed with you. I have written 
about cracking before, but I feel that I must do it once again!

I haven't seen any cracks from BASTARDS INTERNATIONAL (maybe they are
not so well spread here in Finland), but I believe that you are one
of the leading groups in France. Anyway, you said you nowadays wait
one month after the game is released before you crack it. That is
fantastic idea! But it won't help very much, if only one crew does
this kind of great move.

I don't know how we could see all the crackers doing that kind of
smart business that Bastards Int. has done, but I have something to
suggest: If you are a swapper, please stop spreading games which are
cracked 0-2 weeks after the day of release. Tell the crackers that
you won't swap their games if they don't slow down their cracking!

I think that this kind of action would be effective enough to stop
too fast cracking on ST-scene. And remember: I don't fight against
crackers, I fight for the future of Atari...
