Are you also waiting for that bird to land in your room ??
Well it seems that the birdy is a bit late (to say the least) !

Atari had promised to release the machine in december and then they said that
it would come in januari.......hum.
Februari and march past already and still no Falcon, I saw nothing in the
Dutch computershops.

Rumours go that the manufacturers plant in Korea (or at least in that area)
had produced faulty Falcons ( a severe screw up ) !
They weren't good enough to get released on the market, it seems that Atari is
looking (or has already found) for a new plant.
Then there is the problem of the money, Atari has almost no money left to
produce and ship the computers properly.
The price tag on the Falcon's in the U.K.( and this will count for other
country's too )is increased with ( i believe ) 100 pounds !
Atari will lower the prices when the Falcon in the new case appears, they
selling old( maybe even with bugs ) Falcon's for very high prices.
This proves my point that Atari is in big financial problems at the moment,
they try to get some money to ship those new cased Falcon's with.

Atari Belgium has closed down and 4 of it's employee's are fired.
The distribution in Europe will be handled by Atari Benelux, the name of
Atari Benelux is changed for this purpose.  
I forgot what it is called now.......

Several (paper)magazine have decided to stop there activities.
The public buying those magazine's is getting smaller and smaller and several
mags cannot survive with such a few people buying there magazine's.
In the last issue of a wellknown Dutch magazine is a farewell article for
both the magazine and the Atari firm.
They see no future anymore in the Falcon because Commodore and Apple are
already profiting from the huge delay of the Falcon.
Both Commodore and Apple can cut there prices now because they selling lots
of computers and it will be hard and maybe even impossible for Atari to 
compete with these prices.
 
Commodore is selling hundreds of A1200's a week now.......  
They are shipping big amounts of the machine to our country at the moment and
many impatient people that sold there ST's have decided to buy one.
Some people are thinking about buying a fast PC 486 with some extra stuff 
like a soundblaster card.
Personally i never would buy a PC because i don't want to be ONE of the 
MILLIONS of PC users on this world.
I rather buy a more advanced machine with a smaller group of users and a
good demo/magazine scene.

Did you see such a scene like the one on the ST on the PC ??
I think that the PC scene will grow now ofcourse with all the ex ST and Amiga
users buying PC's these days.
If the Falcon never will be a success it will be difficult for me to buy a
new machine with me beeing a real anti Commodere and PC man !

** God.... i watch the Miss Holland selection on TV, Jee my eyes hurt. 
Sorry for that little line but it's hard typing this with all these super
gorgeous girls on the TV **

Where was i...... oh yes in my room typing things about computers and things.
As i said it will be hard to find a new machine that has my kind of specs,
price and scene !
So please let that Falcon bird land on my table soon or i quit the whole 
computer business and start collecting stamps !
I think that all people at Atari can do the same if the Falcon turns out to
be fried chicken.

So fans if you have the same opinion as i have then wait and pray.......
