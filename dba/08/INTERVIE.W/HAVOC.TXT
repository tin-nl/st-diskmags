What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Most are nice, but I think that people are wanting to release too
much and because they want to release so much they produce mostly shit.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
The ones I have contacts with are cool guys, but I know there are many
assholes out there who are just busy to give the scene a bad name
(even if they don't mean it that way, I dunno...)

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
Small 'n' original games, new effects (easy to say, hard to do) and
ofcourse greetings to us !!!

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
The ones I've got are nice, but that's because I format them if they
don't bring anything new. I really like the Ripped Off disks and Flash Funpacks (I think it's
a bad thing that Flash stopped after number three)

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
They make some of the coolest hardware ever, but these guys never heard
of the word 'marketing'... But which Atari-owner doesn't know that already?

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
No, I hate games (few exceptions).

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
I like it coz it saves me lots of money, but I think the pirates shouldn't
just do it for the money, as some people I know do (they are ass****s)

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
No, I don't have enough money anyway.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
Computer!Totaal (I get it for free), ST Format (sometimes), ST Magazin
ST Computer, Computer Shopper, Personal Computer Magazine,
 Atari ST Nieuws, STart, ST and many more...

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
I think they're shit but they are free so I read them...

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
Dunno

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
No, it's too expensive (but they are nice to put some shitty games on).

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yeah, the idea is right, but I think there is still too much craptalk.

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
As I've said before, far too much crap

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
Someone who says he can do anything, but in fact rips everything
 from other people whose level he will never reach

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
I think we shouldn't talk about them too long, coz they're not worth it...

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Yes, join Emhaa

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)

Termite etc. and I coded my first demo (just text, no graphics
and a continuing beep).
