What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Most demos are fairly average, occasionally there is a good one, with a new 
effect, but most demos these days are just re-hashes of the same old things.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
Most crews are excellent coders, who in my opinion, are wasting their talents.

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
There's not much else that can be put into a demo, see my answer above.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I think that menu disks are an excellent idea, but then I'm biased, after all 
why have ten disks of programs that could fit onto 6 or 7 disks. But there 
must be a point to it, demo or utility CD's are good, but intro CD's are a 
lame idea!

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
Atari is probably one of the most techologically advanced home computer 
compagnies, but need to put some hard work into their customer relations, 
support ,and marketing departments.  Having said that I have œ1000 put 
aside for a Falcon.

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
I don't play any games at all, although the new Elite 2 looks pretty good, so 
I might buy that.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
Very, Very, bad, I used to do a lot of it myself, but I realised how much 
damage it could do the whole ST scene, not to mention my freedom.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
No. not really, I don't buy games beacuse they're boring not expensive.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST Format, ST user, Personal Computer World, Micro-Mart, Somtimes ST Review,
and any other computer magazines which come my way.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
Generally, the ST one concentrate too much on games, and not enough serious 
stuff, my favourite magazine was the old ST World, loads of applications type 
stuff!

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
NO MORE GAMES!   and make lot more like a diskmag, with articles written by 
the people for the people.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Generally no, most of the programs on the disk are generally rubbish, I think 
that magazines should either be sold with only some issue with disk, and some 
without, or pay extra at the counter for the disk if you want it.
 
Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Mostly, but more serious and programming, and less craptalk.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
See above  -  But a note to all diskmag producers (Except ST News, and STEN), 
please remember that there are people who might like to read the mag in mono.

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
Computer related - Module compilations                                        
Non computer related - Sky One satellite channel

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
I don't think that anyone is a lamer, as everybody must be able to do 
something, just because someone can't code a full screen, vector bobs or 
something doesn't mean that they're useless, every team needs swapper!

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
See Above

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
If you think you could be a lamer, then find something that you're good at, 
and stick too it.

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I bought a ZX80 in 1980, which I built from a kit, then ZX81, then Spectrum,
then BBC B, then 520ST, then 520STM, then 520 STFM, now 1040STF
