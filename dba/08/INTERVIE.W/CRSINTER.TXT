Pseudo computer name...                                             (1 LINE)

Group you're in (if any)...                                         (1 LINE)
The Giants (yeah....)

Function (like coder, gfx man etc)...                               (3 LINES)
Coder and crappy musician

Latest project you made (like demo, games, mod etc)...              (3 LINES)
Our last released project was the "Look who's coding too" demo 
written in GFA BASIC. But three guestscreens were written in DCK
without telling us!! (Assholes). Now we're working on a new, fine,
brainblasting basic  demo  including a 100%  GFA  resetdemo!  Our 
other  project  is  a  assembler  demo.   Our  assembler   coders 
(including  me)  are  working  on  this  demo  called:   'Massive 
madness'.

Real name...                                                         (1 LINE)

Age...                                                               (1 LINE)

Sex (male or female).. .                                             (1 LINE)
Male

Weight...                                                            (1 LINE)

Length...                                                            (1 LINE)
What the heck! Anybody interested in my length?????

Hair (like color, style or just plain bold)...                       (1 LINE)
Black, not very short.

Looks (like playboy, shit head etc)...                               (1 LINE)
Ask my girlfriend. (Something human I hope)

Clothes (like jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap etc)...                   (2 LINES)
Blue and black jeans. And nice "overhemden" (over-underwear clothes).

What do you think of demos in general (good ,bad, more...)...        (3 LINES)
I think the limit of the ST is reached. Use the capabilities of the 
STe, or wait for the Falcon. But the demos are alright.

What's your opinion about demo crews in general...                   (3 LINES)
I still wonder why people do so much work. Coding, painting, making 
muzexx, but for what? People copy your demo, look at it one time, 
and if it's not good enough, they wipe it like "Sandwichspread"
(I hear u say: I don't dig it)

What would you like to see in new demos (like small games or else)   (3 LINES)
I miss the possibility in skipping a part of a dentro. If I'm bored 
with looking at the shitty fractals, I press space. But the demo is
still going on! This is irritating me!! I like to see more animations
in demos.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...            (3 LINES)
Only demo-compil disks, 'cause they can spread screens from our demo!
But I've to say that most of them contain a lot of shit.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
They are extremely slow! And in the Netherlands they are not so 
popular in general because of the few commercials. Many people still
think Atari is a game-computer. (With two little blocks and a square 
as ball. You know it.)

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
Yes, but there is a lot of shit like Popeye II (it's extremely boring).
But games like Epic are great (but the 3d stuff is a bit slow)

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
You can't destroy the piracy section, so the companies have to live 
with it. But as long as they can make (big) profit, it's exceptable.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
They can't be low, so stop dreaming guys!
Who wrote this question, Bonus again? (yes and they can be low look for
example like Oxyd, very nice game !) 

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
Now non of it. The last mag was SAG, but they stopped because the 
volunteers had to spent too many hours in making it. So nowadays I
borrow some MAGs from friends of my.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
They are too little interested in demos.

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
What? Me bringing out a magazine! Ha ha! That time is already past.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
I like it, but the price of a mag+coverdisk is extremely high, so 
they have to fuck off if they are intended to make profit with cover-
disks including the newest version of a 6-sector format program! 
Ha die zit!!

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Idea sounds good, but not too many diskmags please!

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Too much articles (with a lot of craptalk)!

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
Next question please!

What is completely useless according to you...                       (3 LINES)
Aah, that's a better one. A useless thing is a ST without processor,
or without diskdrive. Also useless is a DBA-interviewer without
questions or a ST-conference without people. The most useless thing
for girls is a Atarifreak-boyfriend.

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A person who cannot walk properly. Yo guys! I'm bored with all stupid
questions about lamers, because I think we KNOW what a lamer is, after
hundreds of articles. U can say president Clinton is also a lamer, 
'cause he can't code. STOP ABOUT LAMERS!!!!

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
Is this another question of Bonus? (heh, heh)

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Quristiontrupiffisa werstje konplosme!

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I stole the ZX-spectrum (48KB) of my brother.

Tennis, electronics, surfing. Making fun in pubs.

afgelopen?? P.s. bijna !

Dear Bonus,
You've made a nice interviewer but it's quite bomb-minded. Please 
try to solve these problems for any ST.  And watch your  English, 
there are rather many mistakes in it.
(p.s. as I told before it was made in 24 hours,so don't yell !!!! Bonus)
