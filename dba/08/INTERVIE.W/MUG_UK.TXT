Length...                                                           (1 LINE)

Standard Metal Freak but without a leather jacket !!

Clothes (like jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap etc)...                  (2 LINES)
See Above

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
They are slowly getting repetative in that the same ideas are being churned 
out but the next incarnation is slightly faster than the previous or older 
demos are being rehashed with modules playing instead of chip music etc. etc.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
They are OK.  I personally can stand reading scrolltext full of Ego Trips and 
nothing else.  If a group is good then their demos should be able to show this
without the aid of a banal scrolltext doing it for them !!  I admit when I'm 
shit!

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
More original ideas.  Legacy and Hemoroids are breaking the mould with their 
various Dentros.  Get some good routines and show them off.  You don't have  
to wait for the latest Mega/Giga/Bloody Huge demo to release them. Do it NOW !
     
Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
Yes because I do them myself - but only the legal ones.  This is the only real
way that I am ever going to learn anything about machine code !!  As for 
Illigal disks - they exist, theyre's not much you can do about them.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
If the Falcon is as good as all the info says it is then Atari have finally 
done something properly.  God was the STE a half-hearted attempt or what !!

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
I don't play that many games these days as I am too busy doing stuff for my
own programs or doing menus for The Source.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
It exists and unfortunately it will carry onto the Falcon and screw everything
up on that machine as well.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
NO !!  I rarely buy originals as I have all the originals I need already !!

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST Doormat, ST User & ST Bad Review.  I also read all the PC Magazines as I
have a crappy Amstrad 286 in the house as well.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
They are all full of the same old shit.  ST Doormat treats everyone as a kid 
and nothing new or advanced is ever discussed, ST User tries to teach you
informative stuff but fails and ST Review is just crap !!  Get ST Applications
instead !

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
I would get rid of the childish 'No! Don't do it like that ... do it like this
because we think we know what we are talking about !' attitude.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
They are allright I suppose but it is so rare for them to have anything up to 
date and useful on them.  If I see another crap STOS game put onto a cover 
disk then I will scream !! 
 
Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes (why do I need three lines to say that ?)

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Yes (same sarcastic comment as above !)

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
Not a great deal !

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
Nothing.  Your magazine is probably one of the nearest competitors to the 
stalwart ST News !!

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
The kind of wanker that writes to me (even though all my documents say that  
I am NOT a pirate) and ask me if I want to swap sofware !!  One recent example
is of a 13 year old kid asking me for a Strip Poker game !!

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
They should all be forced into a college and made to learn about the machine 
they own, the scene they want to get into and if they fail then their 
machine is confiscated and sent to Lamers Heaven - The Boy Racers in Ford 
Escort Brigade !!

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
LEARN ............. QUICKLY ..............  OR ELSE SUFFER !!

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
Oooooh .... that's a bit bitchy isn't it !!                                   
I started out on the humble Spectrum 48K and moved to the Atari in 1987 !!

frieds and (of course) the teachers and other things but I've run out of
room !!

Good Habits ( like always(?) be nice )...                            (2 LINES)
Unfortunately I have very few good habits - but I suppose being a proper 
gentleman whenever necessary and polite to the future in-laws !!

Bad Habits ( like bitting your nails )...                            (2 LINES)
Got it in one !!  I have no finger nails ... other than that my only other bad
habit is that I'm a nymphomaniac (but that's not too bad a habit to have !!)
