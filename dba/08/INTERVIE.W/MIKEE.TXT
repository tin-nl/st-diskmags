What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
MOST DEMOS ARE WELL CODED I'M SURE BUT ARE BLOODY BORING AS HELL!

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
MOST DEMOS CREWS TRY TO DO WELL, BUT USUALLY DON'T. MANY USE OLD TECHNIQUES, 
BORING MADMAX MUSIC AND RIPPED GRAPHICS WHICH DON'T MAKE A GOOD DEMO. 

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME REALLY ORIGINAL EFFECTS AND NEW MUSIC THAT CAN SHUT 
THE CRITICS UP. SCROLLERS, DIABOLICAL CHIP MUSIC, STARS AND DISTING LOGOS ARE 
- V E R Y   B O R I N G -
     
Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES BUT I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THEM.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
ATARI HAVE MADE/MAKE 3 MAIN MISTAKES...  1) THEY DON'T ADVERTISE ENOUGH AND 
WHEN THEY DO, IT'S LATE OR IN THE WRONG PLACE.   2) THEY PUT THE CURRENT 
SOUNDCHIP IN THE ST.   3) THE STE WAS MUCH TOO LATE AND HAS RECIEVED LITTLE
SUPPORT.

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
MOST GAMES ARE CRAP.  CRAP SCROLLING, CRAP MUSIC AND CRAP GRAPHICS.  THERE IS 
THE ODD EXCEPTION TO THIS THOUGH : (POOL, NO SECOND PRIZE, ENCHANTED LAND AND 
KICK OFF 2).

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
NO COMMENT

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
IF THE GAME WAS BRILLIANT AND WORTH THE MONEY, THEN YES.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST FORMAT AND ANYTHING TO DO WITH ST'S I CAN FIND.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
MOST STARTED OFF WELL, BUT HAVE RECENTLY DEGENERATED.  THIS COULD BE TO DO 
WITH THE FADING AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR THE ATARI ST.

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
MORE AND LONGER PD (DEMOS ETC) REVIEWS. 

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
YES. IF THE SOFTWARE IS USEFUL.  RECENTLY THOUGH, AS THE MAGAZINES HAVE 
DEGENERATED, THE COVERDISKS HAVE TOO.

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
YES.  THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THEM USUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND 
INCLUDE RELEVENT AND INTERESTING/INFORMATIVE STUFF.

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
ABOUT RIGHT.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
MORE ARTICLES ON 'HOW TO DO' STUFF.

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
THE ST VERSION OF LOTUS 3 !!!

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, A LAMER IS SOMEONE WHO GOES AROUND SAYING THAT HE/SHE
IS THE BEST AT SOMETHING AND HAS AN EGO THAT IS TOO BIG.  PEOPLE SHOULD LEARN
ABOUT MODESTY AND FRIENDSHIP.  I DON'T SEE MUCH OF IT ON THE ST SCENE IN 
GENERAL.

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
ACTUALLY, THE CONCEPT OF LAMERS IS POINTLESS.  IF SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING THEY 
HAVE DONE, HOWEVER SMALL, IT SHOULDN'T BE SLAGGED FOR NO REASON.  PEOPLE HAVE
TO LEARN AND EVERYONE WAS A BEGINNER AT SOME POINT.

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
ALWAYS TRY TO BE ORIGINAL IF YOU CODE DEMOS AND BE FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE WHO 
DESERVE IT.   DON'T PISS PEOPLE OFF FOR NO REASON.

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
BOUGHT A SECOND HAND ST, BUT I HAD A PC BEFORE (VERY OLD AND SLOW!)

Hobbies ( Besides your Atari !!)...                                  (2 LINES)

Favourite state...                                                   (1 LINE)
