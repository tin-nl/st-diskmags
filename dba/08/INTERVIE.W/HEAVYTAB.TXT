jeans,T-shirt,etc.

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
All are good,some are great

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
They really make it worth buying an ATARI ST/E

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
Our names in their greetings list.More funny animations.Games are nice too.   
More STE things are welcome too.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I haven't got many so i can't tell ya if they are good or worse

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
YYYEEESSSS,they make great hardware but they advertise it in the wrong way    
Their LYNX beats the lame boy and the lame gear easely but they don't 
advertise it enough.The same thing is happening with their home-computers

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
NO they should enhance their games for STE(look at eclipse,thalion they're 
doing nice things)

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
It destroys the market,so keep piracy small so that people buy more origenals

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Yes,but most lowcost software is old or trash

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST-format(the best obtainable in holland).ST-nieuws(best dutch magazine)      
Soon a magazine about the LYNX.It's called something like"KOM LYNXEN"and is 
produced by the INTERNATIONAL LYNX CLUB DEPARTMENT the NETHERLANDS.(great 
maggie)

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
The games reviews are good,but their previews on new computers are a bit less.
They all say different things about the FALCON and the JAGUAR(this is also a 
fault of ATARI to i think)

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
Try to improve the communication with ATARI.More positive articles about demos
and democrews.More usefull stuff on the coverdisk

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Yes,but there's a lot of shit on them.(ST-format has improved a bit with 
putting full working programs on them).Put some real demos on it please

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes,but you can't read them on the toilet

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Yes they're just fine

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
More information about the hardware(LYNX and JAGUAR if available)             
More visual effects to look at when you get sick of reading all those texts

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
The release of amiga 1200.A keyboard on an amiga altough its handy for typing
in your name in the hiscore table

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
1:Some one who steals code and uses it under his name.                        
  2:It's blue and has prickles....(sonic)                                     
    3:The mascotte of nintendo (mario,a really irritating piece of shit)

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
People who can't code aren't lamers.Only peoply as mentioned above are and 
people who fuck up people because they think they're better

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
No,they have to figure it out them selves

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I didn't start as a lamer,did you?
