In the previous issue of the D.B.A. magazine i told you about a new (paper)
magazine called "Metal CD".
This magazine contained loads of reviews, interviews, news and other stuff
about the famous rock/heavy metal bands.
The best thing about this mag was that they provided a CD with it.
On this CD you could find several unknown or famous bands, this way you could
learn about their music and maybe even enjoy it.

I only saw the first two issue of this great magazine but after that it became
very quiet.
Issue three isn't in the shops and it had to be there already for a month now.
Non of the bookshops in my place have it, but other releases of the same 
publishing-firm like Classic/Pop CD are still on the shelves though.

If you have seen the third release of this magazine ?
Well, if you did then let me know because i like this mag. ( esp. for their
free CD ).
Write to Slimer( the address is in the ABOUT DBA box ).

                       See ya'
