Are you a person that spends hours and hours searching for a CD in the shop ?
Fear no longer, i made a small list of CD's that are worth buying( even though
everybody has a different taste ).
If you are in Hip-hop, Rapp and that sort of stuff don't bother looking at  
the list because there will be nothing in it for you anyway.
The roundup is made out of my own collection and i only mention the best ones.

The list is divided in several catagories, so check out your own favourite
section( Heavy Metal, Hard Rock, Rock and Popular ).
Behind the titels are some remarks about the different CD's !
