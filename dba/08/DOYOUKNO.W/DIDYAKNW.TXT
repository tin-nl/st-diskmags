-- Bonus is also a real cab-driver some hours in
   the week.

-- Talking about mixing pleasure with bussines !

-- D.B.A. is busy with new things in the disk-magazine area.

-- This has nothing to do with the shell this time.

-- As always it will be some sort of new revolutionary project.

-- It will involve other disk-magazines also.

-- It possible that you can read about it in this issue already.

-- I ( Slimer ) learned all basic stuff about Lotus 1.2.3. within one week 
   while playing also around with dBase 4 !

-- Altough i work with PC's, the ST is still my favourite computer.

-- The speed of a Falcon 030 is comparable with the speed of a 386 SX.

-- That's around 25 Mhz. !

-- It's not stunning but it sounds quite different than 16 Mhz. !

-- The CD from Ugly Kid Joe (America's least wanted) is very good !

-- Read more about in the previous issue.

-- Each new issue will get a theme, the next one will be about love !

-- If you send us articles, make it romantic, slimey, full of love ( sigh ).

-- My ( Slimer ) color monitor broke down again, i'm typing all this crap
   on the monochrome monitor( yuck ).

-- Thanks to Vigo for lending it to me for a couple of weeks !

-- This issue was hard to make because several people quit the ST and 
   therefore stop writing articles for us.

-- We are in desperate need of new writers otherwise we also disappear from
   ST(E) the scene like many others( Maggie, Ledgers, DNT, Disk Times ....). 

-- The D.B.A. is also short on coders, write us when you are interested !

-- Ecto 1 got a job as a representative agent.

-- Ms. Angel bought herself a PC ( 386 SX 33Mhz ).

-- You can read more of this in the article of Ms. Angel.
