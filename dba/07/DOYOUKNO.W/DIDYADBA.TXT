                       DID YOU KNOW THAT.........

- Our weird coder called Bonus bought himself another car !!!!??
  This time its an old Ford Combo ( Taunus ).

- We lost track of how many cars he had over this year.

- Vigo has an enormous amount of PD software, he must be one of the biggest
  PD library's in this country.
  Only on the Atari ST(E) ofcourse !

- The D.B.A. shirt of Bonus is almost white, because the logo washed almost
  completly off.
  
- So we decided not to wash our shirts anymore, you can reconise us by the
  bad smell.

- This is our last issue, we quit the ST and go to the Amiga !?

- How's this: The D.B.A. Amiga Mag. !

- Naaaahhhh, why shall we produce a magazine for a bunch of lamers ?

- Don't worry the D.B.A. magazine is Atari ST/Falcon only !!
  He' this magazine is only for the ST elite.

- I scared you there, now didn't i !

- I have to leave you now because i have to go to a little D.B.A. meeting.

- He i'll be back with some more, you just have to wait a couple of hours.
  Who said i was crazy..........?

- Back again, he did you know that my color monitor broke down ?
  Naah didn't think so, well they fixed it and i can continue with my
  work on the magazine.

- It's awfull to have no monitor, i nearly went nuts......

- That we also sent our magazine's to Atari Benelux ( Netherlands ).

- We are thinking of starting a corner in which you can drop all the positive
  negative opinions about Atari in.
  You are ofcourse always welcome to sent us your opinion about Atari now !

- Mr. Kilwinger from Atari Benelux wanted to meet the people behind this
  magazine !

- But in his next letter he changed his mind and he sent us our disks back
  with a little note saying: it doesn't work on a TT( and there was no other
  computer to test it on ?? )
  ( The mag. runs fine on a TT, big parts are even made on a TT !! )
  
- Conclusion: Atari Benelux owns only one TT with an unknown TOS version !
  ( or a ZX 81 running at 32 Mhz with a whopping 4 Meg and 65 Meg. H.D. )

- We are dumped on the Atari mailing list, this way we keep informed about
  all the news that Atari want to reveal( how exciting.......) !

- Ecto 1 got his driving license some weeks ago ( when you reading this ).

- That most groups on the scene are very bored because they are waiting for
  the Falcon computers.

- A lot of people have sold there computers and the software swapping has
  almost reaced zero.

- When Bonus started printing on his printer ( ofcourse ) the head got
  damaged ( one of the 24 needles broke off ).
  The printhead is very expensive, costing 1/3 of the price payed for the
  whole printer itself !

- Conclusion: our hardware is falling apart, time for some new stuff !

- Ecto 1 bought a car, it's a red Opel Corsa with an electric atenna !
  So when you see a car with an atenna going up n' down it's Ecto 1 !! 

- You can find more Did You Know stuff in the Ms. Angel corner !

- Ms. Angel is a super romantic woman ?

- Bonus always sleeps when i call him, early in the evening ?

- When Bonus thought he solved a bug in the magazine, it popt up again ?
  Some tricks to solve the bug didn't work !

- There seem to be people that check first who wrote the article, especially 
  when my name is on top of the article they avoid it !!

- I'm thinking of letting my name out of the articles or change it !

- We had keyboard control in this magazine but we had to dump it because
  it caused problems with the new music !! 

- End of transmission.............
