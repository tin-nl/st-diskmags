    Hello and welcome to another comms article written especially  for
    the Disk Busters Association Disk Magazine......

==============================================================================

    Well  its been several months since I last wrote a  comms  article
    and  boy  have I learned loads more.  I have had to sell  my  fast
    modem  to pay off my phone bill (which was œ305!).But  I've  still
    got my trusty SupraModem 2400.
    Well  I've been connecting to hundreds of BBS's thoughout  Britain
    and I have found lots of weird and wonderful information.The  best
    piece of info I've been given is that BT are reducing phone prices
    on  sundays  between 3.00pm and 12.00am (up to 28th December 92'),
    woopee!

    Horray  for  Vincent Partington.  He has created one of  the  most
    flexible  and  most  amazing transfers protocol ever made.  Forget
    Bi-modem  ,  forget Z-Modem ,  forget Y-Modem ,  forget any  other
    protocol , Jekyll is THE BEST!

    Basically  it lets the user download and upload file AT  THE  SAME
    TIME! Believe it or not , but its very true. The program also lets
    you chat in a split screen mode as well!!!!

    I have used every version right up to V.132 ,  and each and  every
    one gets better.  Version 1.32 is quite spectacular ,  when a user
    pages you ,  a peice of music plays....Its really good because  if
    you are a sysop it gets your attention quick-sharp.  The transfers
    are  very good.  There is built in Error correction ,  so you  are
    literally guaranteed no CRC-ERRORS when you extract your download.

    The whole system is very user friendly as there is a seperate file
    called  HYDE  ,  while lets the user configurate Jekyll  to  their
    modem standard. For BBS's however there is a seperate configurator
    which  envolves  the  user  to make a  seperate  file  on  a  word
    processor , it is still quite simple though!

    Overall  this program is sooooo sexy it is unbelievable.  I  would
    definetely one to get your hands on.

                      MINI-BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM

    Hmmm ,  yes its always been my dream to be the sysop of a Bulletin
    Board.  I was sent this disk from a buch of coders in Norway ,  it
    is a bulletin board terminal ,  in which you can redifine all  the
    text , change the BB name , change settings , and basically have a
    good time setting up your own bulletin board.
    The docs for the program were fairly good ,  covering most of  the
    aspects  in setting a good BBs up ,  and  explaining  difficulties
    etc.  The author ,  Lars Eric 0sterud  has  obviously  spent great
    time in getting the system user friendly , because it took me only
    half an hour to get the whole thing set  up on my  hard  disk  and
    running ,  which is surprisingly fast compared with some other BBs
    terminals I have test runned.  But you may ask 'does this  account
    for the loss in quality?' , nahhh , the whole BBs terminal is very
    good.  I  suppose the only loss is that it does not  support  ANSI
    graphics ,  but hey , not every other Bulletin Board supports ANSI
    anyway!
    Once you have set everything up and are about to go on-line to the
    public , you will have to get a few beta-testers to go on-line and
    basically  muck  around  your BBS and have a  good  time  spotting
    mistakes  and things.  In my case I had an Amiga Freak to  try  my
    system out.  Well you know the sarcastic comments he would come up
    with wouldn't you?

    'Where's the Amiga Software to download , David?'
    'Humm..errmm..ANSI graphics?'
    'Not much of a message base is it?'
    'Don't you support Bi-Modem?'

    Etc,etc,ect. Well you ignore an Amiga owner who gives you comments
    like  that  and  get  a good comms enthusiast  to  give  you  some
    comments.I actually got a sysop of a board in Britain to beta-test
    mine ,  and the software gave me good results ,  and thats in  the
    eye of a sysop!

    This time our better BBS award goto a special Scotish Board  based
    in Aberdeen. Yeaaahhhh , its ;=)


                         -------> STATIC BBS <--------

    Well when I first logged on to this board I was in for a surprise.
    I had an old 300 baud modem (Pace Linnet!) ,  and I spoke with the
    sysop  for about 20 mins ,  and what a very friendly sysop  he  is
    too! Hi colin!
    The  board is FULLY ST OPERATED ,  contains millions of  great  ST
    files from utilities to up-to-date demos.   The board is  operated
    using Quick BBS software and works a gem with F.Z.T.  STATIC  also
    supports  JEKYLL  ,  so  you  will have  no  probs  downloading  7
    uploading  the latest stuff.  Actually you can meet  several  demo
    coders when on-line to STATIC ,  I met a member of THE RODENTS and
    the sysop says he knows quite a few demo coders.

    So guys ,  if you want to log-on to the coolest board in  Scotland
    then phone :

        STatic BBS :> 0224 648277 :> v22,v22bis,v32,v32bis,HST <:


==============================================================================

    I am interested in getting in contact with your group members.

==============================================================================

    Anyway please if you are interested in getting any of the software
    above ,  or swapping ST/STE DEMOS or if you are a demo group  such
    as SYNERGY then get in touch with me :-
