                    ABOUT THE DISK BUSTERS ASSOCIATION,

The D.B.A. is a demo/magazine crew from the Netherlands.
We have made some little demo's like the Batman Demo Classic and the
Just Fun G.F.A. demo part A.
Part B will be soon released in this year ( around autumn  1992 ).
The biggest contribution to the Atari ST " scene " are the popular D.B.A.
magazine's, which we are going to produce as long as we can.

We can't make all these productions on your own and that's why we have
help from other ( wellknown ) groups and people from the ST scene.
Especially the magazine takes a great part of our ( spare ) time, we can
not fill the magazine totally on our own.
To fill the magazine we have a magazine team that work on every issue, this
team consist's out of people that support us with writing articles for us.
