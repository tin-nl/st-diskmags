MAGAZINE OPINION

                   Opinion about D.B.A.-Magazine.
                   ------------------------------

Hi, all readers of DBA-Magazine! Last time there was an article by me
where I told my opinions about disk-magazines in general. If you have
not read it, it doesn't matter, because things have changed now...
I said in issue #6 (I had not seen it when I wrote my article), that
Maggie by DELTA FORCE is the best diskmagazine on ST. But the sixth
issue of DBA-Magazine changed that fact.

Congratulations, Slimer/Bonus/KGE and the rest! Your magazine is now
number one on ST-scene. Your magazine does not need any bigger
improvements, but of course you can add some small details in it.

I'm now waiting for Disk Times 2.0 from UNIVERSAL CODERS. It seems
that DT is the only magazine, which can steel the leading place from
D.B.A.

If you are an editor of other diskmagazine, don't bother to write
any stupid things about this opinion. I know there are also other
good magazines than the one by D.B.A., but they just are not that
good. If you don't agree with me, please send me better magazines,
and I'll once again correct my opinion...

P.S. You can also write for coding, swapping or just to have a plain
     chat with me...
