              ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL CRACKING SERVICE

****************************************************************************

Sometime ago we recieved a package from the I.C.S. containing several disks
with new cracked software.
We never took any futher notice of it, we copied some PD stuff including
our magazine and returned the package.
In the letter with the disks I wrote that we only wanted to swap PD stuff and
maybe some other usefull stuff.

Sometime later i began to hear rumours about " mob " kind of activity's
within the ICS.
Welknow crackers said that the " boss " of this cracking organisation paided
his crackers for their work.
Then i recieved Amazine 2 from Mad Vision in which they say that the ICS
had send lots of packages with new cracks to several crews all over the world.

So i thought about that package and that the purpose from ICS was to sell
us the software ( i thought they wanted to swap some stuff ).
The writing on the short note was to terrible that i didn't knew what they
wanted anyway. 
I will not deny that we of the D.B.A. never swapped any illigal software in
our lives before.........
But our illigal swapping activities are almost nothing anymore and we swap
mostly Public Domain programs nowadays.
The only big purpose of swapping some illigal stuff is to stay in touch with
some groups who are important for our magazine spreading.
Sometimes we needed some programs to review it in the magazine because the
software compagnies don't send us originals.
Now don't start to slag us, just ask yourself how all those other magazine's
get their reviews............

Well there isn't much harm in that because lets face it we do make good/bad
publicity for those games( maybe even increasing sales of legal software ).
If any software compagny is reading this: Why don't you send us some stuff
to review !!!

I'm wandering of now, we where talking about the ICS.
That buch of braindead asholes where trying to sell us software that wasn't
published, they had it 3 weeks before the release date !!
I'm not the only one of the D.B.A. that was mad as hell, i also write this
for most members of the D.B.A. !
What really struck me was the fact that the " boss " of the weirdo's was an
Italian !

If there is anything in the world that i hate, it's gangsters on the ST(E).
That guy seems to pay for holidays, cracks, expenses and that sort of stuff
it seems like a well organised gang.
Okay there are many other cracking crews but some of them release the software
some time after the release and they are no gangsters.
I won't say that they are cool for what they are doing but what the ICS is
doing is going way out of line.

What will happen to the Falcon if these kind of cracking crews take over ?

Our advise to all the fellow ST crews is,

Keep away from those lamers, you don't want to pay the " mob " now do you ?
If you insist of buying illigal software, please change to another cracking
crew.

                        The D.B.A.

To ICS: You are free to reply in the magazine, because we hear anybody's
        opinion.
        We publish your reply without censoring !
        I'm pretty shure that this magazine will reach you, no reaction says
        enough, i think !
