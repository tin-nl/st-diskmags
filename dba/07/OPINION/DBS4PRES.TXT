DBA FOR PRESIDENT
                   DBA MaGaZiNe  4  PrEsIdEnT  !!
                   

I ever thought that the DBA Mag is a real good Mag ! But I always liked
or even prefered The Maggie ... but since the Delta Force took over the 
control of it, it slightly have fallen in its quality !! The Menu is 
just not good, the articles are boring, there are NO Scene news and no
coding hints and tips. That was my Opinion of Maggie 9. But when i saw
Maggie 10, I really disliked it ! The only coding hint was Fullscreen
Overscan. I think the 24618 time that this was reviewed in a Mag. The 
scene News was so F**KIN' old, I couldn't believe. And the Rest of the
Maggie was Editorial or articles which said : ST fading out ....
I think, Delta Force should go on Amiga, becuz they like it more ! As
U can C in sum Interviews with older DF Members, this is really true.
But should such a group rule the ST Scene ?? I think, no ! Syntax Terror
was REALLY GREAT !!! Punish Ur Machine was quite good, but where is a
new DF Demo ?? I couldn't find it anywhere ...  I'm inside, I'm you 
                        Sad, but true !

PS. I have nothing personal against any member of the Delta Force, becuz
    I don't know any so far. So this article is not mentioned 2 b the
    reason of sum fuckinx against me or AM. It is just my opinion.
