PICTURA 2.0


Pictura 2.0, New drawing program.

So okay we already have a lot of nice drawing programs, but heee this
one should have a chance too. It looks nice ,it works nice and it 
costs nothing. That's one thing that counts !!!!!

Pictura 2.0 is the latest version of a drawing program made by the 
Detonators. Its written in GFA basic and a bit ASM. It has most of
the functions you can also find in Degas Elite or Crack Art.

It looks a bit like the DBA Diskmagazine shell. Every thing can be 
chosen by klicking on one of the big boxes. Some of these boxes have 
other boxes under them with a number of sub functions.

It's just a nice drawing prg, if you need help with it just read the 
Help file included in the main prg. So get started, try it out and if 
you have comment\ tips\ or just anything at all about Pictura 2.0 
write to the Detonators. I also want to thank Beweise for sending me 
the latest version of it...
