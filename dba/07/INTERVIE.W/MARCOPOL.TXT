Demos are more and more beautifull! We don't see any more demos like the first

In new demos I would like to see some small games and some original pictures 
or logos.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I like Syndicate compil menu disk's because we can find demos from Finland and
Sweden that we can't find in France. The intro's menu are very cool!

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
Atari Corp. wants to sell more ST and in some days Falcon. But if they don't 
have a commercial politics they don't find a lot of guys who buy their

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
I read a lot of French computer's magazine in book-shops. A lot of them are 
not interesting enough to make me buy them.

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
The magazines for ST are smaller and smaller.... We can't find any demo's 
informations in them.

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
A coverdisk is a good idea when the price of the magazine isn't very high. But
why coverdisk contains old DP programs?

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
I like the idea of a diskmagazine because we can find what we want in it and 
if we don't like it we could delete him easier than a paper magazine.

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
If the writer of an article is interested in what he writes the article is 
very good!

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A lamer is somebody who get demos, games and other stuffs and say to all his 
friends that he has this and this but can't copy them because he has not the 
right to do this. A lamer is someone who do nothing and pretend to do a   
lot of things

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
It's not a subject.

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
no!

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
