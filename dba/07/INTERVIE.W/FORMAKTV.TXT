What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
THE LATEST ONES I'VE SEEN HAVE BEEN PRETY GOOD.  THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
ME MORE GAMES LIKE MONSTER BUSINESS (TLB) FROM DEMO GROUPS.  I WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE  OUR OWN GAME MADE IN THE NOT SO FAR DISTANT FUTURE...

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
IT REALY DEPENDS IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF A GROUP OR NOT. AS A MEMBER OF A GROUP
I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OTHER CREWS ARE TENDING TO BE HELPFULL.  AS A NON CREW
MEMBER I WOULD SAY THAT THEIR IS TOO MUCH SWEARING IN DEMO'S THAT DON'T 
NEED IT.

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
AS I SAID BEFORE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE GAMES FROM CREWS SUCH AS MONSTER  - 
BUSINESS.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE DEMO CREWS NOT TO USE OLD MUSIC SUCH AS MAD MAX
, AS IT IS GETTING VERY IRITATING.
  
Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
YES AND NO.  YES FOR SEEING OTHER PEOPLES TALENTS, AND NO, BECAUSE MOST OF 
THEN ARE RIPPED OUT OF DEMO'S, WITHOUT THE GROUPS PERMISSION.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
IF ATARI CORP WANT TO BE AT THE TOP THEY REALLY NEED TO PULL THEIR FINGER OUT, 
AND HEAVILY ADVERTISE THE NEW FALCON. AS THEY BODGED THE STE AND LYNX UP IN 
THE SAME WAY. ALSO TO BRING THE FALCONS PRICE DOWN SO I CAN GET A 14 MEG
FALCON !!

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
BY MY THINKING I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT BY CHRISTMAS TIME NEXT YEAR THE STE AND 
STFM WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED, AND THE FALCON WILL TAKE THEIR PLACE. THOUGH I 
HOPE THAT A LOT OF NEW ADVANCED MULTI MEDIA GAMES WILL APPEAR ON THE FALCON.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
WELL.. BY THE TIME THE ST-CD-I DRIVE BECOMES AVAILABLE, THE AMOUNT ON PIRACY 
WILL START TO DIE OUT.
 
Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
OF COURSE I WOULD, BUT MOST GAMES AT THE MOMENT ARE A BIT DUFF...

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST-FORMAT..(ONLY JUST) , ATARI ST USER , STRATERGY PLUS, MICRO MART (GREAT MAG
),INTER-ACTION ( A VERY GOOD AMERICAN MAGAZINE FOR PC'S ), AND THERE'S MAYFAIR
, SWEEDISH EROTICA, PENTHOUSE, ER... HANG ON!  THERE NOT COMPUTER MAGAZINES !!

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
ALL OF THE ABOVE ARE SUPERB MAGAZINES, .... EXCEPT...  ST FORMAT !!  WHY DOES 
ST FORMAT REVIEW DEMOS I.E. ( OVERDOSE ) AND NEVER INCLUDE THE PEOPLES NAMES 
WHO MADE THE DEMO ?  THERE WILL BE A ARTICLE ON THIS IN THIS DISK MAGAZINE.. 

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
THE ABOVE FOR A START !  PLUS A SOME QUESTIONS TO SAM TRAMIEL FROM READERS OF 
THAT MAGAZINE.  PLUS THE USUAL COVERDISK WITH A DEMO WHICH IS SELECTED AS THE 
BEST DEMO IN A MONTH !!

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
YES I DO, BUT THEN I DONT WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE THE STUFF THAT'S ON THE DISK.

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
YES I DO, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN A DISKMAGAZINE SUCH AS THE LOST BOYS 
MAGGIE ( NOW DELTA FORCES ), BUT AS YOU CAN SEE WE ARE A LOT BETTER !!.. ( NO 
HARM INTENDED TO THE DELTA FORCE TEAM OR THE LOST BOYS )..

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
FOR THE MOMENT THE ARTICLES ARE FINE THEY HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS WHICH
IS GOOD.  THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO BRING OUT A CLASIFIED ADS DISKMAG OUT ONCE A
WEEK, SO THAT ADVERTS FOR HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CAN BE USED FOR ST USERS.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
AT THE MOMENT I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY, AS I AM A  D.B.A. MEMBER IT'S 
UNFAIR OF ME TO SAY ANYTHING AS IT MAY NOT BECOME SO.

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
1. A CAR WICH IS TOTALY EMPTY OF PETROL                                       
2. AN AMIGA                                                                 
3. MY ST, BECAUSE I WANT A 14 MEG FALCON WITH A 65MB HARD DRIVE AND A MONITOR.

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
SOMEONE THAT EITHER RIPS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE, GFX, MUSIC ETC, FROM DEMOS OR OTHER
ST USERS AND CLAIMS TOTAL CREDIT FOR WHAT HE HAS NOT DONE.

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
WHATEVER ANY LAMER RIPS FROM DEMO'S ETC... ALWAYS GETS FOUND OUT, SO WHAT'S 
THE POINT OF DOING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
YES BUY A ^!!$%*! AMIGA ! ... AS THIS IS WERE ALL THE IDOTS ARE USUALLY AT!

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I FIRST STARTED ON A ZX-81, WRITING 1K PROGRAMS THEN ONTO THE SPECCY 48K IN 19
86 THEN TO THE SPECTRUM 128+ IN 1987 THEN TO THE 520 STFM IN 1989. FROM THERE 
ON TO THIS DAY I STILL HAVE THE SAME ST, BUT WITH 4MEG RAM, DIGITIZER, SAMPLER
ETC.
