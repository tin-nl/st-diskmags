Cool...

Clothes (like jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap etc)...                  (2 LINES)
I don't use any clothes, I am naked!

What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Demos are good for you! If every cool group would do demos instead            
of cracking, there would be much more high quality stuff on scene.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
Some of them are cool, some of them are not...

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
NO ripped graphics, NO ripped sound, NO ripped code, much hard work,          
and probably some new ideas...

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I like some of them... Mostly I collect ANIMAL MINE's GSC-disks and           
our own FUN PACKs...

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
Cool machines! Don't make any big faults with FALCON and you will see         
the world down on its knees praying to have one of those great computers...
 
Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
If I'd like to play games, I'd probably buy an Amiga. But there is            
nothing wrong with ST-games either. I just wonder how long does it          
take before programmers can use the hardware of STE...

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
I don't like it a bit... Crackers are usually very talented people,           
and I'd like to see them doing something else with their computers!

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Absolutely yes!

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
I used to read ST-Format... But it has become too expensive, and the          
authors of ST-Format have lost their brains...

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
As I said, I do not read any normal magazines these days!

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
NO cover-disk! Magazines with cover-disks are much more expensive than        
the other magazines and usually there is nothing but crap on these disks.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Hmm, take a look at the previous answer...

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes! You can compile graphics, sound and interesting articles.                
Nowadays I read only three disk-magazines and they are: DBA-magazine,       
Delta Force-Maggie and Disk Times from Universal Coders...

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
It depends on what magazine you mean... In DBA-magazine #6 I liked            
nearly every article.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
I don't know... Nothing... Everything... Something...

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
???

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A shithead who thinks he is the best on scene. Usually a 14-15-years old      
boy with 520STFM (I don't mean that all of them are lamers)...

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
It is fun to kick them when they get on your way...

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Stop talking bullshit about others! Grow up or go to hell!

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I bought my MSX (which IS the best 8-bit machine) about 7 years ago.          
2-3 later I changed it to ST and the rest is history (har!har!)...

Hobbies ( Besides your Atari !!)...                                  (2 LINES)
Jogging, listening music, school (yak!) and drinking alcohol!

Normal state...                                                      (1 LINE)

is not so often!
