What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...     
They are good if the Ideas are good. I think it is better to have good Ideas  
  
than to have good code. When both things come together it is very good. But I 
Hate Demos with just a Megascroll or so on.

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                
If there is friendship It is very good ! And I think there must be demo crews 
But when everybody hates the other members and only thinks about him to get   
famous or so on, I think it don't fill the reason why joined together !

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) 
I would like to see some more veccys like Glenz, gelee and all these things 
like on the Amiga. But I would also like to see some Story-Demos which tells 
story's, like Le Jolie petit matin, I really liked this demo. 

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...          
When they are good, i Like them because I don't have so many disk and I don't 
have so many space to store the disx. But I don't like Compil when they crash 
after every second screen becuz I have 2 reboot everytime and I hate that !

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) 
Atari MUST do more PUBLIC INFOS (WERBUNG). I got a shock when I heard a Atari 
man saying :" I just recognized that you have to tell the people that you have
good hardware " . But I think now every Non-Complete Lamer knows the FALCON !

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)
i think there are not so bad as everybody say that they are (Power Play and so
on But I better like Amiga Games because they often are more professional with
better Sound (Tracker, never Chip) and GFX (32 Cols and so on) and cool Intro!

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E               
If it is not too much I can live with it. Better say i MUST live with it. 
Becuz I am not Krîsus and all those Softwares have too high prices.

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      
Yes, of course I would ! 1000%tly

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...               
TOS and COMPUTER FLOHMARKT (My favourite ! YEAH . HI everbody there)

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles) 
I think CF (COMPUTER FLOHMARKT) is not actual enough cuz it comes out every   
2nd month ....

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????            
I would do more interviews with scene people and I would make a speakers 
corner where verybody can tell ANY shit and NOTHING will be censored.

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why) 
Yes I do becuz the magazin with coverdisk is most times cheaper than the      
original Software on the Disk and so you don't have to Buy very expensive 
software and you needn't copy it illegal !

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...               
Yes I do ! Becuz you can do Programs, texts pictures and everythink at once ! 
Just multimedial ...

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...      
I like them in general but I think most craptalk articles aren't that funny .

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...              
I would do more pictures and a well designed Desktop like all these new Mags  
on Amiga because I like well looking software with good menus. I would also   
choose a picture of the issue or so on.

What is completly useless according to you...                       
Soundchip music all time long. I think in a magazine you have enough spare    
Processortime 2 do nice Trackersound !

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                    
Roman Maritschek . OKE, serious. A lamer always wants your new software and he
always tells you, that he have the newest games which is completely wrong. Cuz
when he says that he have Wing Commander II on Amiga he can't be right !

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       
I think it is funny when you dont be personal against cool guys .

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                               
Yup ! How to get off a lamer: Just say "36" to him when he leaves you door and
that will make him think for about 2 weeks. How to recognize a lamer: Just say
36 to anybody and count the seconds to ANY answer. More than 3 secs are lamers

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???               
I bought a C64 and the first thing I did was making a programm in Basic.      

Hobbies ( Besides your Atari !!)...                                 
Drawing ... Fantasy .... Hanging around ... I have not so many "REAL" hobbys.

Favourite state...

Good Habits ( like always(?) be nice )...                           
I Can throw a person out of our house in about 3 seconds.

Bad Habits ( like bitting your nails )...                          
I do it too often.
