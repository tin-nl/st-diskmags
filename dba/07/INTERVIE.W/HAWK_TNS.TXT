What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
Some good demos on ST, but unfortunately most of them are pure crap. It looks 
like if someone ports a good idea from Amiga or releases something completely 
new,then everyone is trying to do the same. (i.e. Aggression's shadesprites)

What's your opinion about demo crew's in general...                 (3 LINES)
They are good, if they aren't complitely lame.

What would you like to see in new demo's (like small games or else) (3 LINES)
New ideas, not menus like in union, cuddly or in mindbomb. A small menu if it 
is needed. There is no need for a menu in every demo....

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
Yes/no, there are simply too much compil disks around these days. Both intro 
compils and pirated stuff. But on intro compils I think Animal Mine compils 
are  pretty good and rest is more or less crap, excluding few exepections.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
They alway promise too much and they are a bit too slow in releasing new 
machines.Somtimes they release machines in a rush and that means lotsa bugs 
in the machine itself and in the TOS :-(

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
Most of them are pure crap but there are some, which I even play every now 
and then.

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
It's got a bit out of hands, especially with crews who sell cracks.
 
Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)
Yes, if the game is worth to play - is worth to buy.

What normal magazines about computers do you read ...                (3 LINES)
ST Magazine (German), ST Format

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
They give some news about the Atari scene in the world....

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
I dunno...

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Yes, if it contains software what you can use. No, if the stuff is pure manure
and the price tag in the sky.

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes I do.

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Articles with interesting stuff are always fun to read, but if there is only  
slagging and crap talking then I don't bother reading them.

What would you change if you were asked to and why ...               (3 LINES)
.....dunno.....

What is completly useless according to you...                        (3 LINES)
(in where ????) In school, Swedish lessons.

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
....I don't think that these three lines are enough for describing a lamer, so
 I won't start writing my description of a f***ing lamer.

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
Piss off and die - lamers !
 
Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Keep low, and advance with your skills at small steps. Don't try to be what yo
u aren't at the beginning.

Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
