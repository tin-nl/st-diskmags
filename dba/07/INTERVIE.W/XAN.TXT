Next question.

Do you like compil menu disk's and explane your answer...           (3 LINES)
Yeah! So I can see many great Intros and Dentros and new effects, but they    
should have better quality. (AMIGA!) ST:I don't like GSc(for example). And I
haven't seen so much on ST.

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
They are really stupid. They could be number one. But they aren't. Commodore 
is ! They should make more 'Commercial Breaks'. German: Sie sollten mehr 
aufprollen! English: They are really poor guys at.

What would you change if you brought out a magazine ????             (3 LINES)
Everything! Especially the editors and Autointerviewers(great idea!).

Do you like it when a magazine has a coverdisk (please explain why)  (3 LINES)
Yeah! So if there were (but never is!) an cool Source you had to write it. And
sometimes you don't have the right language. So you have to organize it!    
But they must be cheap. (Not more than 7DM) Amiga+ is too expansive!

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)
Yes! But only in scene mags (not yours, stupid idiot!). Stop shitting. Your 
mag isn't worse. The best one I know is RAW (AMiga!) from PMC!

Do you like the articles (to serious, to much craptalk etc)...       (3 LINES)
Only Craptalk is great! Serious ones must be intresting and actual! Craptalk 
is all time actual.

them. But Roman(a playable Game Player) should really be taken in prison!
