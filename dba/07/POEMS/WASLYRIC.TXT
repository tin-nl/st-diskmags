WAS NOT WAS LYRIC

WAS NOT WAS LYRIC

As I was listening to the Was (Not Was) album I've just reviewed, I
started to pay some attention to the lyrics of a song called "I feel
better than James Brown", and WOW, is it strange.  So for your
bemusement here are the lyrics to it...

No punctuation, and it's probably not arranged in the right line
structure, but I'm to lazy to try and get it right


When we where in love I pretended
that you didn't exist
That way I loved you more

You suggested that we get married and move into a house
I suggested that we jump overboard and live underwater
in the lost city of Atlantis where mermaids sing and
tuxedoed dolphins bring you breakfast

One year later I was transferred to the moon
Worse pay better hours
I was transferred to the moon
Worse pay better fellow workers

I built our love out of blood
I went to the dentist and told him
Take out my heart
I feel better than James brown
I feel better now
I feel better than james brown
I feel better now

I was attending Mardi Grais with fidel Castro
Buxom cross dressers threw fake gold coins
at our feet as we discussed the fate of the revolution
Suddenly CIA men dressed in bikini's
tried to stab us with fountain pens
Fidel blew mustard gas through his cigar and
imobilized the lot of them

Ninteen tequila's later we had a deal,
Havanna goes back to the mob,
and Fidel and I open a chain of Kentucky fried chicken shops

Ain't life sweet
I feel good
I feel better than James brown
I feel better now
I feel better than james brown
I feel better now
How do you feel

I feel better than james brown
I feel better than james brown
repeat to fade.

Now, is that strange. or is that STRANGE?
