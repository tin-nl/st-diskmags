              In the past I have had to use the T.V. rather than 
      a monitor, just because I couldn't afford a monitor. Well 
      all that has changed now, because I have just purchased an 
      ATARI SC 1435 MONITOR.  The differences between a T.V. and 
      a Monitor are quite astounding. Aspects such as better 
      picture quality and better sound make you want to buy the 
      SC 1435.  

                The SC 1435 is just like the PHILIPS CM8833 
      MK1/MK2, but it has a re-designed case. You can do quite a 
      lot with this new-ish little 14" colour monitor, here are 
      it's specifications:

      CONNECTIONS:
      ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

      RGB connector:     This is the main link between the monitor
                         and your st.

      AUDIO L AND R:     Mostly usefull for ste's as they have stero
                         sound, though mono sound is on stfm's.

      
      ADJUSTMENT:

      VOLUME:            I wonder what this is for?

                         into a green screen monitor.            

      CONTRAST:          Adjusts the contrast.

              Well, there you have some of the technical info on 
      the SC 1435. I think it is a very good monitor for the 
      price, which retails for around œ210. I'd even go to say 
      that it is one of the best monitors i've seen in a long 
      time, or perhaps the best! As it outbeats the CM8833 
      MK1/MK2, TV/MONITOR TYPES, most MULTISYNC MONITORS and 
      other monitors which are around.
