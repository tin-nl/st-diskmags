FLOPTICAL DRIVE

                              FLOPTICAL DRIVE
                         ------------------------

The latest technology to appear in the ST world is the floptical drive.
A floptical drive looks exactly the same as a standard 3.5 inch floppy-
disk, the major difference is in the high density magnetic coating giving
a storage capacity of 21 megabyte on a single disk.

Floptical disks use barium ferrite (BaFe) for the magnetic coating on
the floppy, a material which is much more reliable than standard ferrite 
coatings. This enables much higher track densities to be created, 
1,245 tracks per inch (tpi) instead of the 135 tpi of standard disks.

The optical part of the drive is the tracking mechanism. Because of the 
high track density of the disk, an extremely accurate tracking system is 
necessary to read and write to the disk.
The surface of the disk has concentric tracks (servo tracks) embossed 
on to it which cannot be altered, damaged or erased in any way.
An infrared LED shines on to the servo tracks and the reflected light is 
picked up by an optical lens which guides the read/write heads to the
correct position over the data.
In this way, these servo tracks act as highly accurate guides for the drive
heads ensuring pinpoint positioning and elimination of errors.

The actual drives are SCSI divices and can be driven by ICD host adaptors
and software, physically the floptical drives are the same size as a 3.5
inch floppy drive.
Floptical drives can also read and write to standard 720 K and 1.44 MB
floppy disks, so you can use a floptical drive to read any 3.5 inch
floppy disk.

The large amount of data that can be stored on a floptical disk makes it 
an ideal medium for multi-media applications - with 40 MB and 80 MB
3.5 inch floptical disks under development this medium is likely to
become popular.

The drive will cost    œ 439.99
A 21 MB disk will cost œ  24.99
