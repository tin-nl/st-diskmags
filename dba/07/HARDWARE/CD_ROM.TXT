ATARI CD ROM

                      ATARI CDAR-504 CD ROM DRIVE
                      ---------------------------

Atari entered the CD-ROM arena, then left it again almost immediately
back in 1989 with the CDAR-504.
This was a CD-ROM unit designed to plug directly into the ST DMA port 
for CD-ROM functions and also to be able to play standard music CD'S
through the home stereo. While the machine was a technical success,
it was never actually launched on the market by ATARI, although there
are reports that a substantial number were produced and are sitting in
a warehouse somewhere.

It now looks as though any chances of an ATARI built CD-ROM drive 
being released on to the market has passed, with only two CD-ROM
titles ever being produced. One of the titles was the parts inventory
for a Boeing 737, not really the top item on your average shopping list.

The main reason touted for the drive being dropped was the lack of 
support for the ATARI CDAR-504 platform, although it would appear to be
very difficult to develop software for a machine that you can not get
hold of.

Atari no seem to have abandoned their CD-ROM drives in favour of 
providing compatibility with industry standard devices by means of the
SCSI2 and DSP ports on the FALCON.

If they had just managed to get some software developed, ATARI could
have been years ahead of Commodore cdtv and Philips cd-i.
That did not happen, and the CD-ROM never appeared.
