                THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THIS DISKMAGAZINE

****************************************************************************

Most people never realise that there is more to this magazine than just the
reading inside.
It all started as a project to launch a magazine that would be different than
all the other magazine's.
We were getting bored with all the pulldown menu's and the same look that
most of the magazine's in those days used.
It never was our intention to become the best magazine, to tell you the 
trueth we thought we never could beat or even come close to mags like; Maggie 
and my all time favourite ST News.

It turned out that Bonus our coder made THE perfect shell that a disk magazine
could possibly have.
Together with me, Ecto 1, Vigo, Mr Cool and some other people we launched our
first issue in the summer of 1992.
The shell was still in its development stage because the whole thing used
the medium resolution and it had awfull rasters.
Bonus started to make a new version of that old shell and I Slimer dedicated
and still dedicate most of my spare time in putting all articles in it.
Bonus managed with some help of K.G.E. to make a brand new shell based on 
the old button system.

I started to recruit people for a magazine team because i seen what happend
to the Incoders magazine.
This magazine had to quit, the main reason was a lack of articles and there
are still many magazine's that have a hard time to survive.
The only way to survive is to have a team of dedicated writers beside the
the actual D.B.A. members.

Personaly i'm still not satisfied with the contents and quality of most of
the articles in the magazine.
It is very hard to find people that write good quality articles.
We want to give usefull information and provide a good quality magazine with
well written articles.
The shell is nearly perfect but the contents is'nt always that what i 
( personaly ) would like to see.

As you can see we take our work very seriously, still looking for perfection
and that is the strong force that has driven this magazine to the top. 
It is not the hang to be the best anymore it has gone further than that.
Many people enjoy reading our magazine, we provide them with several hours
of reading fun.
We want people to get the feeling that they are a part of the Atari scene and
that they actually become a part of the scene by writing for our magazine.
If you don't have the skills to code a superior demo/game or something like
that you can always join the magazine team and show that you are willing to
do something usefull.

The magazine brings also people together and it keeps the scene alive.
There are also many people that simply can't afford to buy a paper magazine
because they are unemployed or simply don't have the dosh.
I saw a documentory about many people beeing unemployed in England and that
for a lot of men some hours of soccer in a week was the only time that they
could escape from the daily misery.
So this magazine has an important social side aswell, we like to offer some
hours of reading fun for the ST owners among them.
The magazine can be obtained for only the price of the stamps by us or one
of the members of the Free P.D. & Shareware Society.

Many people think it's a piece of cake to make a magazine, paper magazine's
don't even take us serious.
I think that disk magazine's have a bad reputation for using bad language 
and sometimes have topics about porno 'n stuff that really kills the disk
magazine community.
We had no problems with our magazine in the U.K. because all of the P.D. 
library's we have contact with are glad to spread it.

We produce a magazine that is for free......
It cost's us time and money to create a new issue every two months.
You enjoy reading it, so why don't you send us a donation and help keeping
this magazine alive and kicking.
