First of all..
I (M.M.M) an ex member of Royal Instant Pudding have joined HMD and so have
Phygorax (now Duri-17) and Xytar (now Kaos-B)..
But Royal Instant Pudding aren't entirely dead.
Zorquan is now the only member left in the group so good luck to him..anyway..
The subject I'm going to talk about here is quite old and you might have 
heard about it apprx. million times in all the magazines but hey, not from me!
The thing I was going to talk about is piracy!
I think everyone can see that the ST is dying cause nobody buy's the games 
(right!??).
Well it's not cause of the piracy!!!
It's cause all the ST games are CRAP!!!!!
Except very few of them and they are so few that you can almost count the on 
one of your hands fingers !!!!
And the piracy on the ST is not more than on the Amiga!!!
Some of the guys I and Duri-17 know who have Amigas are swapping this stuff 
and there aren't more hacking groups on the ST!!!!
Personally I do buy games like Kick off 1,2 and Player Manager,Turrican 2,
Populous,Indy 3 etc.
So here's my opinion..
I don't give a f**k about this now!!!
The ST is dead.
And it's not cause of Piracy!!!
It's cause of all those crappy games which no one wants to buy!!!!!!!!
I'll buy a Falcon soon when it will be officially released and I just hope 
that the games programmers won't do the same mistakes as they did on the ST..
Of course there were a few software companies that did good things on the ST..
Like: Eclipse,Electronic Arts,Anco,FLT,Thalion + some FEW others...
Anyway..That's all..
