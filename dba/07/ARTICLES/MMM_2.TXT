ARTICLE BY: M.M.M OF HEMOROIDS

OKAY...WHY AM I WRITING AN ARTICLE ABOUT CHIP MUSIC ON THE ST ?
WELL..READ THIS ARTICLE AND FIND OUT!!

FIRST OF ALL..REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS ,WHEN BEN,CRISPY AND DAVE WERE
THE BEST IN COMPOSING CHIP TUNES ?
ALL THEIR TUNES WERE INCREDIBLE AND LET ME REMIND YOU THAT THIS WAS BEFORE
THE MODULES WERE SO COMMON ON THE ST..
  
BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE NOW ?
SURE WE HAVE LOTSA TALENTED GUYS DOING SOUNDCHIP SONGS BUT....
IN MY OPINION THOSE NEW AND GOOD MUSICIANS CAN'T EVEN REACH THEIR HEALS!!

OK..SO WE NOW HAVE DIGI-CHIP MUSIC..
IT ALL STARTED IN A GAME FROM THALION CALLED 'CHAMBERS OF SHAOLIN'...
WERE A GUY CALL JOCHEN HIPPEL (KNOWN AS MAD MAX OF COURSE) DID LOTSA BEAUTIFUL
CHIP TUNES...
THEN ANOTHER GAME CALLED 'WINGS OF DEATH' WAS RELEASED...
NOW THIS GAME INCLUDED SOME SERIOUSLY COOL TUNES AGAIN COMPOSED BY J.HIPPEL..
AND SUDDENLY A BUNCH OF COOL GAMES WAS RELEASED WITH EVEN BETTER TUNES..
BUT...
THIS F***ING (CENSORED FOR DBA!) MUSIC IS NOW BEGINING TO LOOK SO BLOODY ALIKE
JUST TAKE A LOOK AND YOU'LL SEE IT FOR YOURSELF!!
MY OPINION:
ALL OF THOSE BEST CHIP TUNES (WINGS OF DEATH,TURRICAN,NINJA REMIX) ARE GOOD 
BUT NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE OLD ONES (HYDRIS,SWITCHBLADE ETC..) 
  
BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW...
SUDDENLY OUT OF NOWERE A GUY FROM NETHERLANDS CALLED SCAVENGER OF SYNERGY 
SUDDENLY POPPED OUT OF NOWERE WITH A NEW STYLE OF CHIP-MUSIC ON THE ST!
IT'S VERY LIKE AS THE AMIGA CHIP AND SOUNDS VERY NICE...
IN MY OPINION SCAVENGER OF SYNERGY IS ONE OF 3 GUYS ON THE ST THAT CAN MAYBE
REACH HIGHER THAN THE OLD SOUNDCHIP MASTERS!! (AT THE MOMENT!)
THE OTHERS ARE MAD MAX OF T.B.C AND LAP OF NEXT!

OH SURE THERE ARE LOT'S OF OTHERS WHO MAYBE IN THE FUTURE ARE ABLE TO JOIN 
THIS GROUP BUT AS THE SITUATION IS NOW...--

BEST CHIP-MUSICIANS ON THE ST EVER...

 
  1. CRISPY NOODLE
  2. BEN DAGLISH
  3. DAVID WHITTAKER
  4. JOCHEN HIPPEL (MAD MAX)
  5. SCAVENGER OF SYNERGY
  6. LAP
  7. JESS OF OVR
  8. FRAZER OF SYNDICATE
  9. BEAST OF SYNDICATE
  
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS -MY- OPINION SO IF YOU THINK IT'S LAME THEN BUZZ OFF!
  
OKAY...BEFORE I QUIT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK DBA FOR A WONDERFUL MAG AND I 
ALSO WANT TO WISH ALL GROUPS AND PEOPLE ON THE ST SCENE (AND FALCON ?) A MERRY
CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR...
