            TOP SECRET "AURORA" IS SEEN ABOVE THE NORTHSEA,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who are interested in militairy planes might have heard of the top
secret "Aurora" plane of the American airforce.
Nobody knew any details about this new plane but finally somebody has seen
it flying above the Northsea.
There is a little story that i have to tell you first before i continue
about this new super plane !

I live in a province in the Neterlands called "Friesland", this is a province
with their own language called "Fries".
Friesland was a real country hundreds of years ago, the upper part of Germany
also once belonged to this country ( it's still called West Friesland ).
It was ruled by a King and it was in constant war with Holland, they always
won most of the battles in their time, though !
They had there own hero called " Grutte Pier " a very very big ( huge ) man
with an even bigger sword, he scared the sh*t out of the enemy's !!

Now the once mighty country is a little province of the Netherlands and it's
language is slowly fading away.
Well, lets cut the crap and go on about that plane story........

In august 1992 Friesland was hit by a big bang, it sounded like something
exploded in the sky.
The bang was pretty heavy because there was some damage on buildings and
some people thought that it was a big meteor.
The army was called and they had seen nothing on their radar, the weather
people also saw nothing on their equipment.
There was nothing found of a crashed meteor or plane and people even started
to talk about U.F.O.'s !
A professor has called the Americans and they said that they saw nothing on
their satellite pictures !!

In California in the U.S. the same thing had happend and nobody knew what
was going on.
Pretty exciting isn't, keep reading.......

Then some time later in a magazine called "Jane's Defense Weekly" was an 
article by Bill Sweetman in which he reported an unknown plane.
This unknown plane was seen by an experienced observer on an oil-rig in the
Northsea somewhere in august 1991.
This guy saw a KC 135 fuelplane and two escorting F-111 but the strange
thing was that he saw a triangle shaped plane get refueled in the air.
He saw no details on the bottom of the plane, it looked to be of the same
size of the F-111 fighter-bombers.

Bill Sweetman is also very familier with the shockwaves above Friesland
and California.
He thinks it is possible that the schockwaves are caused by the "Aurora".
Rumours go that the "Aurora" can fly 5 till 6 times faster than sound and
maybe even faster than that( rumours go to even mach 8 ) !!!
Several experts in the Netherlands believe this story and think that the
"Aurora" caused these shockwaves.
I saw some drawings of the plane in a paper and it looks like a stealth
plane to me, from the side it looks a bit like the Concorde.

The last news that the Americans have confirmed that the "Aurora" exists !
Hey, keep watching the sky and keep your fingers in your ears !
