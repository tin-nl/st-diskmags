BE A COOL SWAPPER

                    How to be a cool swapper?
                    -------------------------

Well, I'm not a 'official' swapper of our crew anymore, but I know
something about swapping (I still have some cool contacts, and mainly
because I learnt a couple of things when I worked on Amiga) and I 
want to share my experience with you...

It is good if you are a member of group. Some groups doesn't even
answer to you, if you are just, hmm, YOU. So you should be called
XXX of ZZZ or something like that. But it is certainly not worth of
setting up a group just for swapping.

Always use white envelopes. The brown envelopes look so cheap that
using them may damage your reputation. If you send bigger amounts
of disks (5-10) it is not so important what colour your packet is.

Get as many contacts as possible. If you have only 2-3 contacts, it
is possible that your contacts also swap with each others. So you
couldn't send new stuff for any of them.

Forget everything what I've said earlier! It is good if you follow
those rules, but the only way to get to the top is to be one fuckin'
fast swapper. Also it helps, if you are a cool person (I mean that
you should write personal letters and treat everyone as your friend).

                             Yours,
