O.T.M. GOES MAD


- Calm down, lie down and relax...

- I cannot relax when you are staring at me like you do right
  now.

- .......

- Ask the other shrink he looked at me the same way.

- Coming to that part, why did you brake both of his legs?

- Coz he didn't had more legs.

- Why do I have the feeling you do not take me for serious?

- Yeah, why do I have the feeling you do not take ME for serious?

- I ask the questions around here! Answer my question please.

- What am I doing around here? Who are you? 

- John, Paul take this person back to his room, and give him 
  10 cc. heliumatoomcarbonaatcoolstofhydroxidium so that he can 
  rest.


( 3 days later, same loonyfarm. )

- Well O.T.M. have you slept well?

- Don't know I was too sleepy to know.

- I'm going to ask you some questions you know.

- ....

- Do you feel bad about that?

- Hmmm... and more Hmmm.

- Why do you think that your mother advised you to visit this 
  loony-farm?

- Maybe coz they cook better here?

- Why did you take the car of your parents?

- I felt like driving.

- Without a drivers-license?

- I ran out of ideas!

- What do you need ideas for.

- Must I answer this question?

- O.k. first another question, why did you try to drive through
  the police-officer.

- I did not do anything like that.

- According to eyewitnesses you did. And the officer doesn't drive
  in a wheelchair for nothing you know.

- Well O.K. I did.

- But why

- He didn't move away.

- couldn't you avoid him?

- Why didn't he step aside?

- We don't know yet coz his jaw is still broken.

- Can't we stop this session?

- No we can't yet.

( I stand up and break the man's nose. two men in white clothes
  come and take me back to my room. )
 
( Next day same loony-farm ) 

- Why did you need ideas?

- I need ideas to write interesting stories for the D.B.A. disk-
  magazine.

- The what?

- The D.B.A. diskmagazine. A diskmagazine which is read by bilions,
  and bilions of people.

- A ....

- No wait, I will tell you the whole storie. In the beginning it 
  wasn't so difficult to write stories, coz there wheren't many
  writers for it. I wrote my stories, and people seemed to like
  them, coz whe didn't get any comment on them. But suddenly
  after releasing diskmagazine 2 people started to write things
  for the mag. Well it became a little more difficult, but I could
  handle it coz I still had some ideas.

  But more and more people where going to write for the magazine, 
  resulting in the fact that there aren't much interesting things
  to write about.

  And now diskmagazine 8 is due to release (or was it 7), and I 
  still don't have any more ideas.

- And what are you going to do about that?

- Kill some people and write a book about it, and write a 
  summary of it in the diskmagazine.

- I don't think it is a good idea.

- I thought so, so I will take my dad's car, and drive with 
  220 km/h into a brick wall.

  (A few days later they released me from the loony-farm).
  But I have got to quit now, coz my dad is back with our new
  car. Read all about it in the next diskmag.)

O.T.M.
