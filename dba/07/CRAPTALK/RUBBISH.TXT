RUBBISH


Herman Stukker ( Sonic ) is sitting beside me. He is our new musix man.
Bonus Software is sitting behind him. He doesn't want any part in this text.
The lame asehole who is typing this text is O.T.M. We are all in
the house of my parents. I invited Herman coz we would go to 
Bonus, but Bonus wasn't at home ! F*** they are talking rubbish,
and I can't type  when they are talking such nonsense.
Herman is asking a lot of stupid questions and Bonus is going
crazy at the moment, I think it is a good time to give the
board to Herman coz Bonus is getting a knive out of the kitchen
and I have to run like hell.

Hi, ........ this is Herman typing. After the discription of my 
intelligencerate by O.T.M. (don't ask what this means) I do not 
need to tell very much about myself anymore. Do smell his breath?
I do. 

High this is O.T.M. again I had to cut Herman out, because he was
typing like hell, and my keys where almost burning.
O.T.M. means On The Moon or something like that. This is due to the
fact that Bonus, ...... Bonus? Oh shit got to go now bye!!!!

AAARGH!, will someone pull that knive out of my back? Did I say 
something wrong? 


O.T.M.: Don't you know it is forbidden to walk with knives in
your back Herman! You could get arrested.
I say do I here a voice calling me? Ah Napoleon how his life 
going??? Shit Bonus interrupting me again. He is now the one
who is talking nonsense. And they say I am stupid!!!!!

Afraid of the truth? 

I can take the heat of again, He doesn't know what to type.
Hey Bonus what did this guy do for us again??? Oh yeah he
composes musix, that explains everything.

YES, I COMPOSE MUSIC! AND I'M PROUD OF IT! You f**king ass****s can
not appriciate a fine piece of art! I'm wasting my so needed time.
Your not worth it! LAMERS! DAUGHTERS OF SONS OF BITCHES! MOTHERF**KIN'
ASSHOLES! L A M E R S ! L A M E R S ! L A M E R S !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now now, temper, temper. As always you are completely wrong!
It is: You f**king ase****s, and even that is not correct, It
is ase****e. Bonus left he had an apointement with his shrink.
(At 11:32 pm)! 
Besides, I can appreciate good art. This so called art is 
coded in G.F.A. or in A.S.M.

Yes, Bonus sat on his knife and now he has chronical *ase*problems.
I hope his -often visited- shrink can finish them, although I won't
make very much difference. Maybe a LOONEYFARM is a good solution...
By the way, G.F.A. and A.S.M. (wich probably means Alternative Sado
Masochism) is no more than a great lot of tiny little letters which
attack your mind in very a serious way. Look, for example at O.T.M.
and Bonus, everybody will agree that this has not do very much good 
to them. Ask the shrink!

Talking about shrinks, I have just called one just a moment ago.
Herman, there are two man coming for you in a moment. They will
wrap you up in a white piece of clothing, but don't bother, 
they only are willing to help you. You must agree, since you
are making Modules, and Sound Chip Music for the D.B.A. you are
not quite the "Old" Herman any more. Ah, the doorbell!
Wait a sec, just opening the door, don't go know, coz this will
be exciting for you.

Oh hello, nice suits your wearing. Did you see that submarine flying
over? It flew right past that big purple elephant over there! There 
it goes, on his way to the moon! Wish I could fly... HE, OVER HERE!
COME BACK! I WANT TO WALK OVER THE MOON!

YO HEY, guys leave Napoleon alone! He is not the real patient.
The real patient lives a few blocks away. Some of us call him
Bonus, but you can call him Guppie. Watch out with him, coz he
can be very nasty, he is armed with a knive!!!
Get to it before he really goes mad (is that possible you ask, Yes
it is).
(The two males in white clothes have left)
Hey Herman, want to join me on the moon, we can go by my invisible 
toothbrush!

Yes, that sounds good! How fast does it goes? Can we still overtake 
that submarine? Come on don't hasitate, this 's going to be the trip
of our lives...or shall we ask the elephant?

No, we can not overtake the submarine, but I could shoot it out of
the air with my instand purple toothpaste.

Oh please, don't do that, they're almost extinct. There are very few
left and at this time of the year they are moving to their propagating
places. Next year there will be plenty of little cute submarines to 
shoot!

Ofcourse, you are correct. (As always,.... No as a Ehm... let it
be.) Let's watch the blue marsians who are walking around with
car stereo's, getto blasters and colour T.V.'s.

OOOOH, they 're nice! And so cute! 
But, what 's  wrong with you? Your eyes are getting very little and 
look at those walls under them! Are you maybe a bit sleepy? O.T.M.?
...O.T.M.? HEY, MARCO! M A R C O !!! WAKE UP! (where did I saw this 
before?) ...Well, I think that was it folks. I'm going to ask if I
maybe can borrow one of those gettoblasters, I need it now couse
someone has to let me out of here. Bye!



         More of this nonsense a next time...
