Okey...Welcome to the first chapter of the Marmalade dictionary.
I wrote this so all of you who are interested to come to Iceland but
don't have any Icelandic knowledge can come..
Firstly..
When you're on the airport and need a lift to town...:

1. Go to the bathroom,cause Reykjavik is not near the airport!
2. How to get a cab...: Go out and look around for cars with a large
   yellow sign on top - TAXI 
3. When you have found this car you say to the driver 'Reykjavik' and
   either a name of some Hotel or the Youth Hotel...
4. When you have reached your destination then you have to say this to
   the driver - ERU ALLIR LEIGUBILSSTJORAR A ISLANDI SVONA HOMMALEGIR ?...
   which means - Thanks very much..How's your mother feeling today ?...
   And by saying this you wont have to give him any tip!!
5. -REYKJAVIK..
   Now you have reached the capital of Iceland...
   What do you do now ?...Well that's easy..Firstly you will have to find
   a Hotel...Here's a little tip..Go to a Hotel called 'Hotel Hallaeri' which
   is the best in town..
6. Now you have a Hotel room and you desparatly want to see the best part of
   the  city..
   Now you can go to a place called 'Spilatorg' which is an arcade place..
   If you say uploud 'Allir hipphopparar eru Heimskir aular!' and you will 
   quickly be the man of the house!!
7. When you have finished your talk to all the dudes there, you have 2 options.

(1) Go to a place called 'Borgarspitalinn'... 
(2) or just go back to your Hotel room and relax...

Next time ...I will tell you how to get booze cheap, etc...
