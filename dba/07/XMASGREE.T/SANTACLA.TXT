                                *******
This time we got an exclusive    *****   interview with Santa Claus.
I ( Slimer ) had a hard time    *******  contacting him because his Fax
broke down sometime ago.       ********* 
So i went to the North-pole     *******  to visit the man in person, i brought
with me the magazine, when i   *********  wanted to show it to Santa, some of
the graphics of the mag.      ***********  where frozen by the cold.
Can you imagine, it was so   ************* cold that the graphics on the disk
got frozen, amazing isn't     ***********  it ??????????????????????????
To prove to you that i'm     *************   not a lyer, you can see it for
yourself. just check out    ***************  the D.B.A. logo for instance !
                           *****************  
Okay then, it's about time  ***************   to start with the interview.
You get to know (almost)   *****************  everything thing that the other
magazines didn't find     *******************  out !
                                  ***

S : Hello Santa, lets start off right away with the questions.
SC: Ho Ho Ho thats okidokie with me, son !

( Why does everybody calls me " son " or " sonny " ?? )

S : Many people guess about your age but no one seems to know how old you
    really are.
SC: Ho ho Hoaarhh hmmm( spit ) lets keep it that way, son.

S : Waaahhh i wanna know.
SC: Ho ho NO !!

S : Whheee otherwise i tell my mommy.......
SC: Okay, okay, don't bring out the heavy cannons, i will tell you.....
    I'm about 356 years young.

S : Do you like computers ?
SC: Yes i own an Atari ST & STE, Ho ho !

S : Which programs do you use ?
SC: Well, i only use a database program, i play a lot of games these days.

S : Thats interesting, which games do you like then !?
SC: Mostly racing and puzzle games....

Then the door swings open and a little guy ( looking like somekind of dwarf )
comes into the white room.
He wispers something in one of the ears of Santa.........

SC: What did you say.......did they gave my STE to some poor kids !!!
    Get it back or i turn you into reindeer food !

The little guy leaves the room and Santa seems a " bit " upset......

SC: You just can't get decent personnel these days. 
S : What do you think about demo's ?
SC: I collect them, that why i use the database program, Ho ho

S : What do you think of the D.B.A. ?
SC: Not much really, they seem to be a buch of weirdo's that seem to be
    promising me the Just Fun part B demo without ever releasing it.

S : Eeerrhh, which music do you prefer ?
SC: AC/DC and the lot........

S : Which are you favourite songs....?
SC: Mistress for Christmas by AC/DC and the old Jingle Bells song.

Then suddenly the door swings open ( wow what a plot ) and a guy dressed in
white ( looking like a doctor ) comes in.
Doctor : It's time for you medicine now Santa...
SC     : No ho ho way, get that loonie out of here !!

The doctor yells for help and two big guys with a straitjacket appear on
the scene, they jump Santa !
Santa is wrestling to get free, Bang ! , one guys goes down......
The other guy is on top now, but NO !! Santa kicks the man in his b***s
What a FIGHT, the doctor screams for more HELP !!
Two more guys come running in, they JUMP also on Santa, what a fight !!
Then the doctor sticks a needle in the arm of Santa.......
Santa goes down............... 


Before i left the mental institution the doctor said the condition of Vigo
had not improved over the last view weeks.
He still thinks that he is Santa Claus, the doctor advised us to play the
game along to prevent an even bigger mental shock( hahahahahah ) !
