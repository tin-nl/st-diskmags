DBA COMMENT

In this box had to be at least 13 interviews with all the members of the
Giants but............

The few interviews we did receive were full of rather strange and obscene
language, we decided not to place them !
We want to prefend this because this was the main reason that most of the
magazines others groups made where kicked out of all the P.D. libraries
in the U.K.

We are not always this sharp on this but we thought that they could do 
much better so we gave them an other chance.
I hope that everybody that is planning to do a interview take note of
this, we are not placing interviews anymore that are full of obscure
language !!!!!!

Please try to be more serious in the future.........
