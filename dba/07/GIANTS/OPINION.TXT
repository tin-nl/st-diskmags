Hello Atari-users of the world!

In this small article for the great DBA Magazine, I would like to make the 
Giants' opinion on the demo-scene clear. We think that the demo-scene is a 
bunch of guys who are mainly interested in making fun, not just in making
demos. Demos is what keeps these weirdoes together, but it isn't the main
object (NO! please not!!). We also think that it isn't really important how
hard it was to make the code for a demo, but it's far more important how 
good your presentation is.

Second thing I'd like to mention is that we are not only GfA-coders, as many
people think we are. True, the intro on this magazine was coded in 100% GfA
but we are very busy with other projects too.

Third subject: the current memberstatus of the Giants.
