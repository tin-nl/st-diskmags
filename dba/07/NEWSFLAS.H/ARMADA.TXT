ARMADA IS DEAD

Armada has split up, we got the news straight from Hawk of TNS.
The Armada was a union of several crews and individuals, the Napalm Soldiers
was one of these crews in this union.

This is what Hawk said in his letter,

Some news regarding Armada....Armada doesn't excist any longer. Why?
WizTom and Qwerty of Universal Coders ended up UnC and joined 
Aggression and so did Teque. So there were only Aggression & TNS
in the Armada. We decided that it doesn't make much sense in 
keeping two crews in Armada....the second reason is that there
were some twats (in fact quite many), who thought that Aggression
had changed it's name to Armada so they didn't know that there
were some other individuals and crews in Armada also. This made
things complicated and also crews only greeted Aggression, TNS or
UnC seperately, not under Armada label. However, Aggression and
Napalm Soldiers will continue "co-operating" and we will try to
release the next issue of Disk Times in the future (in the next
generation :-) ).

I took a piece out the letter because it explains perfectly why the crew
split up without leaving something out.
We wish everybody that was in Armada a good future in there new outfits or
on there own.
