Hi, I'm FIX of the ex-Flames Of Diamonds. We've recently changed our name
to Odyssey, cos some of our (previous) members had left the F.O.D. and we
wanted to get into demo-coding.

About half a year ago we released our F.O.D. intro disk including our soft-
warelist. Actually we shouldn't have done that, cos that gave us the repu-
tation of a swap-crew that can't do anything else but that. So, to get rid 
of that reputation we changed our name to ODYSSEY. This was essential to 
make sure that we have a chance to improve our status in the ST-(or perhaps 
Falcon) scene.

Odyssey now consists of the following members:

Digital Coolness  - GFX
Fix               - Coding
Equalizer         - Coding
Detonator         - PR & Additional stuff

So, we DON'T swap any illegal software! DON'T send or ask us for any illegal
software!

I know it's quite confusing crews changing their names continuously, but as I
explained in this case it was essential. Ofcourse we're not gonna tell you
next month we've changed our name again, we're clean now, so that won't be
necessary for a long long time...
