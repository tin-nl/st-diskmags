EXPLANATION DEMO

Hello, this is O.T.M. (You are aloud to go to another text at 
this moment.)

The reason I'm writing this text is that there is a small G.F.A. 
demo on this disk. Well that is not quite the reason, but it has
to do with it.

The source of this demo is also put on this disk. 
(Well a piece of the source is on this disk.)

First something about the demo: I wrote it before I was a member 
of the D.B.A. This demo must have parts that are farmilliar for 
you if you have read this corner more often.

The original demo (compiled) is also on this disk so that you can
see how it works when it is complete.

I have used some routines in this small demo which will be 
explained later, so I had cut them out before I gave it to
Bonus. These routines are the scroll-line routines. But I
will promise you as soon as the BITBLT instruction will be
explained I will give those sources to you.

Normally I would use other rasterroutines, but you don't have
to know everything so I have used Jedi's raster routines (Thanks
man!!! What do you think about it?)

The main source that is still left is the routine which provides
the screen from nice mathematic dots.(Work it out for yourself.) 

This demo also shows that if you want to make a demo you must have
good graphix, coz else it looks like shit!!! (try it out for your-
selfs I found it out too!!!)

The music is from count zero and the graphix are done by bonus and 
me. 


Good luck debugging it and goodbye!

O.T.M.
