In this sub-menu are some articles about game-consoles.
Many ST users own an games machine these days, so what about a department
with news about those nice game machines.
We like it very much if you going to help us out with news and reviews
on the newest games.
It can be anykind of machine like: The Sega Megadrive, The Lynx, Nintendo
or any other good machine !

Get writing and send us your stuff, only this way we can provide our
readers with all the latest information.
We if don't get enough articles or news, we going to drop this whole
thing or maybe keep it very limited.

Okay, i hope to hear from you soon, have fun with the articles.
One last thing, all other kinds of articles are welcome too !!
