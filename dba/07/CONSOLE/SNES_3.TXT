SNES BIT

Not really much to say this time, if you've read my review of 
Rampart on the Lynx, you may remember I said that Rampart is not 
available on any other machine.  Well, it's just been released on 
the SNES, not that I've played it you understand.  There is one 
game I've played though, and that's

Super Bowling

(I don't understand why Nintendo have this fixation with the word 
Super, do you?)

This is a ten pin bowling game where you can select one of four 
characters (you can have upto four people playing) who each has a 
different bowling style, you can also choose the weight of thier 
ball, left or right handed and the amount of oil on the bowling lane.

And after you've done all of that you, err, bowl.  And that's it.

As a matter of fact, there are two types of bowling you can "enjoy", 
there's Turkey, which is normal highest-score-in-ten-frames, and 
then you can try you hand at Golf.  Golf bowling is where the pins 
are arranged in various possitions (like a seven ten split), and you 
need to knock all of them down using the fewest balls.

The graphics and sound are by no means outstanding, but they serve 
the purpose very well, the only thing worth mentioning is the 
colour shading on the logo, very nice indeed, you certianly 
wouldn't see that on an ST or Amiga.

So, my descriptive tallants may not be upto much, but when you have 
two or more people playing it becomes an excellant game, perhaps 
not suited to everybody's taste
