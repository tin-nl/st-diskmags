EVEN MORE SNES

     Of the racing game Exhaust Heat.  This has been published in
     the UK by Ocean, I think that  the  is the first game on the
     SNES published by a European  company.  (Not the first to be
     wrtiten by a European      company  though, that should have
     happened by the time this mag is  released)

     Do you  know  of  a  SNES  graphics  mode  called  "Mode  7"
     (origional name huh?), this is where the SNES can rotate any
     screen image, and in Exhaust Heat  this  is used to move the
     track around the  car.   Yes,      the  car  stays perfectly
     still and  the  track  moves  around  it,  looks  very nice,
     especially when you spin off and do a few 360 spins.

     What you need to do  to  actually  PLAY the game (instead of
     looking at the  graphics),  is  to  compete  in  a season of
     Formula 1 grand prix races.  In  the first season, you start
     of with all the basic equipment,  and,  as you win races and
     recieve prize money, you can  buy  better parts for you car.
     There a range  of  things  to  buy,  although  most them are
     'standard' things  like  engines,  chassis,  front  and rear
     wing's, the general sort of grand prix stuff.

     There are supposed  to  be  better  arcing  games available,
     Super Mario Kart for example, but if  you own a SNES and you
     can't find a copy of  Mario  Kart,  Exhaust  Heat would be a
     good buy.
