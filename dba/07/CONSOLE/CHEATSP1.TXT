CONSOLE CHEATS 1

                    BILBO'S SUPER C.O.C.K. (V1.0)
                    ----------------------------

     That's right, indignant and easily-offended readers - This is my
Super COCK!  Whassatthen??  Well, it stands for.... 
     Super (NES/Famicom) Console Only Cheat Kollection!! 
So if you've got the Mother of All Consoles - read on. 
If not - why not?

Notes
-----
1. I have dropped the 'SUPER' from most titles.
2. Some cheats may only work on certain versions of games (eg. a cheat 
may work on a Jap machine but not on the US/PAL version or vice versa)
3. There may be some confusion between LEFT/RIGHT on the controller and 
TOP LEFT/TOP RIGHT. If in doubt, try both.
4. In the case of passwords, there may also be some confusion between 0 
and O or 1 and I. If in doubt, see Problem Determination Suggestion in 
Point 3.
5. I CANNOT (and will NOT) be held responsible for any sucker who blows 
his machine up will trying any of these stupid cheats!!
6. There are some notes and dedications at the end if you're interested.
7. This is Version 1.0 (sounds technical, eh?). I will try and update 
this when I have the time/inclination/information. This MAY include 
some piccies (eg. The Smash TV map should be easy to draw) - I will NOT 
be trying to draw any Mario level for obvious reasons (ie. I have no 
arms).
8. Anyone out there with any red hot hints/tips/cheats/spare money is 
more than welcome to send them to me.
9. There is no Point 9. I only inserted this to piss you off!

FINAL FANTASY II - Some tips....
Once you've acquired the Excalibur from Kokkol return to his hut later
in the game and you can purchase some rare, deadly weapons like - 
Shurikens, Ninja Stars, Samurai Arrows. Buy them after you have defeated
the Giant of Bab-il.
To find the Spoon Dagger - Enter the Sylph cave and talk to the Karate
Fighter, then leave. When you acquire the Falcon airship, return to
the overworld and head for Fabul. Chat with Yang's wife and she'll
fork over the frying pan. Take the pan and bash Yang over the head with
it. You'll then learn the Sylph summoning spell. Next, go to Fabul once
more and Yang's wife will give you the Spoon Dagger. Despite a wimpy 
name, the Spoon Dagger is the most powerful Ninja weapon in all of 
Final Fantasy II! While in combat against Zerumus towards the end of 
the game, try it as your second throwing dart.

FINAL FIGHT (GUY) - Replenish lost energy by repeatedly walking up and 
down in front of the white dogs on Level 4.

LEFT and TOP RIGHT and press START. Press B when exiting for the
options to take effect.
