No Second Prize by Thalion

The AJS 7R 3A Triple knocker is one of the best motors to get on with. 
It's one of a kind. One days six people claimed to be the owner of this 
great machine. And ofcourse you are playing one of these people who 
claims such a thing. So a deal is made, the one to get the motorcycle 
is the one that preforms the best in over 20 races.

Some famous courses are elected to try your luck like Donington Park. 
So after a bit of training an choosing the right driver, everybody has 
his own special, the race starts. You will find yourself sitting on a 
motorcycle and everything you see is in filled 3D. Houses, trees and 
public everything but in the beginning you will probably won't see 
much cause you are trying to manage with the steering. And believe me 
you will have to get used to it...

With the right mousekey you control the throttle and with the left you 
can use the breaks. With the mouse you control how  you want to "dive" 
into the next corner. Two way's of shifting the gears, automatic or 
just with the hand. Either way you must control it by using the Shift 
and the Alternate key. 
                       
It looks rather nice altough it seems to miss something, after a while 
it all get boring. The details next to the road are almost non, and 
after you have passed several of the other contenders you begin to 
start thinking what shall i do next....
For racing freaks only i think.
