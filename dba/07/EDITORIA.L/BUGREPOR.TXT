BUG REPORT

                                BUG REPORT,

You are reading the D.B.A. diskmagazine and suddenly your screen goes mad or
the soundchip makes strange noises.......
If you encounter such things, please write us a letter with a clear descrip-
tion of the found bug.
Don't forget to mention what kind of machine you are using, we like to know
what TOS you use, type of machine, how much ram it has and how often the bug
appears on your screen.

We are know that there are a view bugs in the magazine program that seem to
appear on surten machine's,

There is a bug that messes up your screen, it should be fixed by now but if
it happens you can always press the ESC key( it will fix your bug ).
As i said it must be fixed now but if you do get it then report it to us !

On the machines with the old TOS 1.0 version you can get some trouble with the
memory.
After reading some articles you have the chance that the program will crash
because of the fact that the old ST has problems giving it's memory free.

Sometimes the little keyrepeat bug appears, just press a key and the bug
will be gone( this one must also be eliminated now ).

These bugs do not appear on some machine's at all, so we want to know from
you if you have seen some of these bugs before and on what type of ST/TT !
We will try and solve these problems as soon as possible !

                        The D.B.A.
