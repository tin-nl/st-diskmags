____________________________________________________________________________

The multipart demo in this review is already some months old when you read
this little review article.
I decided to do a review of this demo because it has some new effects that
i haven't seen before on the Atari ST.
Well, lets dance through this baby,

---------------------------------- THE LOADER ------------------------------

Here we go again, disk in the drive and hit the switch.........
The screen turns black and the drive is doing the boogie, there is some text
on the screen saying: Crack To Beat This: The Return.
Fine with me, yoooh there is something happening, a mountain appears that is 
looking like the one of Paramount Pictures.
Yep there are the stars, they come rotating on the screen, on top of the
moutain is not the Paramount logo but the one of Equinox.
The Equinox logo disapears and gets replaced by the one from Keops, the stars
slide out of the screen and the whole things fades away.

After this stuff some words appear with the usuall text; present a new demo
called.... and then a pictures appears with " Eat My Bollocks " on it.

Nice going with that Paramount stuff, all of this is accompanied with good
chip music, this same tune keeps going for( i believe ) the whole show.

----------------------------------- THE EFFECTS ----------------------------

A little plane is gliding on my screen with some text saying something about
the first effects that are coming up.

Those first effects turn out to be 6 spheres made of dots, dancing and 
spinning over the screen.
After a half a minute or so they fade out and a new effect is waiting to
replace the old one.

Those new effects are 3D unlimited bobs, they change color all the time.
Did i say new effects ?? I did, now didn't i.........
You have to wait a while to see them because those 3D bobs get replaced by
other 3D stuff like big spinning cubes and that sort of stuff.
On the background is a picture of the statue of Liberty looking kind of ill.
It has red spots and it seems to have some tentacles too.......

Sometime there is some short and fast loading to show a new effect.

----------------------------------- MORE EFFECTS ---------------------------

Now for a new effect.......naaahhh you have to wait a bit longer for that.
We get some balls making curves first and in the lower part of the screen 
is a small scrolltext with some information about the demo.
You can press space to get on or you have to wait a while and the demo will
continue on it's own.

Now for a new effect......Yeeaahh this one is rather nice and i hadn't seen
it before on the ST(e).
You get some kind of window with a byte-bending scrolline on it but now
comes the fun part........
The window turns around while the scrolltext is running.
You get to see the scrolline from behind going backwards and some other
effects, really cool.
Nice going there, guys !

------------------------------- BALLS, BALLS, BALLS ------------------------

Some text appears on the screen with on the background a 3D cube changing
in different objects.
In the text they say that they want to show us their balls, do you really 
have to do this ??
Mommy no more balls please......
Shut up sunny watch it or pull the plug !!

Yeah it's the old Red Sector stuff from the A**** (you know), TLB did it on
the Atari ST.
Loads of balls are chancing to all kind of objects, it's nice to look at it
but it is old stuff.
Then a rotating ball scroller appears on the screen, it has a waving effect
and it cotains of 48 balls.
Nice but i remember to seen it once before somewhere, somehow......

This word " effect " is getting to have a nasty effect on my brains.

Well on with the show......
Another eff*** ( burp ) is taking place, some ball objects are bounching
against the sides( like rubber ).

---------------------------------- NEXT PATIENT ----------------------------

After that a big bowl pops up and it spins and spins and sppiiinss.......
Wow the bowl begins to take other forms and gets bigger, smaller and then
finally fades to black.
Then we get to see 3 windows bounching over the screen, in each window is
different effect.
One has a horizontal starfield, the other has some balls making curves and
there one window with a picture.
A new effect on the ST, it seems that all those new things come from the
Amigaahhhaaaattsoe, eeehhh sorry 'bout that i'm just a bit allergic !

Then some tracking sprites appear telling something about the next screen.
( I had to finish this review later because the disc was faulty and it
  couln't load the next part, so i had to obtain a new copy ).

Then there appears a realtime cube with a starfield in it, this cube
rotates and moves over the screen.
It's a cool effect....

-------------------------------- MS-DOS EMULATION ---------------------------

What's this then: I see a very familier screen in front of me.
There is a cursor and that seems to operate on it's own, it execute's
directory's and it gives information.
Then this cursor load the next part of the demo.

Yes i'm sorry to say that i have seen this screen before on a PC( he' i
use these things on my work, i'm always glad when i come home and i find
my fatefull ST to work with ).

We get a screen that looks like a fractal screen to me.
Then we get a load of balls, that seem to set a new record of somesort and 
they make strange curves.
Both the cube and fratal/ball stuff are realtime, so they clame !

After this ball stuff we get 4 big zooming sprites that fly around.
This is followed by some shaded sprites ( just like the Synergy ones in the
intro of D.B.A. magazine 6 ).

-------------------------- THE BLACK CATS GUESTPART ------------------------

In the upperpart of the screen is a small scrolline and in the lowerborder
are some moutains drawn.
In the middle of this is some 3D stuff that is floating around.
Some of the 3D objects are filled with Atari logo's and stuff like TBC and
other things ( it look really awfull ).
I never saw a Black Cats screen that deserved a price for design and color.

After that we get to see 2 big cube's and 2 other objects flying over the
screen and then we get the end part of this demo.

----------------------------------- THE END PART ---------------------------

He' i dont want to be anoying but all the end parts of most new demo's look
the same.
They all have text's either scrolling up ( vertical ) or they have text that
pop up and then disappear.
Well these guys have text that pop up and then disappear.

You get to see a "screenshot" of each part of the demo with the credits.
After all those credits you get a load of greetings......

I pressed the reset hoping to see some more stuff but there was no reset
demo in this demo.

-------------------------------- THE RATINGS -------------------------------

It's kind of hard to give ratings this time because this demo contains new
things but also old and rather boring stuff too.
The new effects that i saw where very amazing and very good coded, so i
think this multipart demo is one of the beter ones around.

Lets cut the crap and lets see some ratings,

Code      : 8+
Graphics  : 7+
Music     : 7
Appeal    : 8

Overall rating : 8+

Nice going with this multipart demo, we really hope that you make another
one in the near future ( but cut a bit on that 3D stuff ).
