GOLDEN OLDIES

                          REVIEWS OF OLDIES..

  Now that the time has come when software companies don't seem
  to  release anything but lame remixes of old formulas. Then
  there's nothing better to do than dig up those good old games
  of the past years.

  Little note from me(DURI-17):
       I have to say that the games I am reviewing are not 
       as many or old as I would have wished.. The reason?
       Well I seem to have been so stupid at one point or 
       another that I sold most of my hyper old classics.



                           METROCROSS.

  This is a conversion of a very old arcade by NAMCO(I think) 
  and was released by U.S. Gold some years ago..
  In this game you have to control a little running fella through
  various stages of hazards. You can get some bonuses by for 
  example kicking coke cans for extra points, picking up some
  blurry green thingy for going faster and the best you can get
  up on a skate board and skate along to the finishing line.
  All things gathered this game simply is about running to the
  finishing line of many stages before the time limit is up.
  The graphics are incredibly rubbish and the music is pain to
  the ears after a short while. However for sheer playability
  you should go for this simple addictive game.


                          OPERATION WOLF.

  A conversion from a TAITO arcade by OCEAN France and a very good
  one at that. Who doesn't remember this one. The first game of the
  genre, a game that spanned many clones and one pure follow up.
  My idea is that what comes first is most often the best and 
  that's exactly the case with this one. In my own opinion this 
  game beates OPERATION THUNDERBOLT and LINE OF FIRE by miles.
  The graphics are good, the sound is mediocre and the playability
  is very good...All in all a very good blast.


                           DUNGEON MASTER.

  Another game which has spanned dozens of clones and one follow 
  up(but this one was great too). The same rules apply here what
  comes first is usually best. Graphics are very nice the sound
  is sparse, but it is the gameplay which stands out. Wandering
  around the mazes solving puzzles and killing monsters is 
  incredibly absorbing and will keep you in front of your monitor
  for days/weeks/months/years!!!!!!


                              NEBULUS. 

  A game made by John M Philips and you control a little frog like
  creature trying to get to the top of many towers solving puzzles
  and avoiding meanies. Very nice graphics, okayish sound and 
  bloody good gameplay make this one a winner. Hmmm the reviews 
  seem to get shorter and shorter every time.


                        EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
          (I wan't that ship not excuses. (c) DARTH VADER)

  You must know what this one is about.. Well what you have to do 
  is to blast the living daylights out of spaceships and giant
  metal camels(sorry I forgot what those things are called)...
  Very lame wireframe vectors(good for their time I guess) and
  most people will probably hate the music, but personally I love
  it cause it put me in the right STAR WARS mood. The gameplay
  is good but the game is far to easy. Anyway it's worth a look.


                              WIZBALL.

  One of the first games from SENSIBLE SOFTWARE which made it onto
  the ST although it was converted by Peter Johnson. You are a
  green ball(hence the name) and you are supposed to bring some 
  enchanted magic land into gloryfied colours(or whatever).
  The graphics are quite nice and the sound is not very good. 
  The gameplay is good though.


                          CRYSTAL CASTLES.

  A very old game from ATARI programmed by ANDROMEDA where you 
  control a bear and eat dots and avoid baddies. In short this 
  is a sort of PAC-MAN in isometric view. The game has lousy
  graphics which is not very surprising considering that I think
  that the game is from the year 1986. Sound is of equal rubbish
  standard. All the same I think CRYSTAL CASTLES is a very good
  game because as with many other old games some effort has been
  put towards gameplay. Note: Kaos B of Hemoroids also likes 
  this game and as we have good taste it must be good.


  Well we have come to the end because I'm now sick of this 
  article. By the way it's my first ever for anyone.
