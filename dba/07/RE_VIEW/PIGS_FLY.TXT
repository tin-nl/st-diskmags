What do we have this time then ??
Sheeps from outer Mogolia, Punisch machines, naaaahhh don't worry we've got
only some flying pigs this time ( phhooe, what a relief ).
It's a multipart demo from the Syndicate in which they clame that they only
use old routines that they optimised a bit.
So lets torture the ST again by loading the demo and writing a review of it.

Here's what i saw..........

------------------------------ The Loader ----------------------------------

Some furious loading begins and some text appears saying: Loading and 
Depacking the Intro.
Still no flying pigs, though.

Then some text comes on the screen and also some introduction pictures pop
up accompanied with some very good module music.
This cool module contains some speech with the words: the Syndicate presents.
After some playing and showing those introduction pics another picture comes
up with the drawn text " If pigs could fly ".
Fine, but i have still not seen any flying pigs !

------------------------------ Hit the space -------------------------------

You must hit the space to go on but you can also wait till the effect wears
off and then the ST will load automaticaly the next part !
Some text appears, followed by " scary dots "......

Some soundchip tune begins to play ( and will keep playing from now on ).
On screen are dots moving on screen that make all kind of figures.
In the lowpart of the screen is a scrolline to keep you from getting bored
after some minutes.
Still, after looking for some minutes i saw no flying pigs !

Rather depressed i touched space......

The following text that seem to block my way to the next part says that i
can expect some shadebobs.
Well i must admit those are shadebobs flying over my screen and they change
colors, making it all very colorful and heavy.
After taking my sun-glasses off, the screen gets filled with linevectors and
they show some text and figures.

I want pigs !!

------------------------------ WHAT'S NEXT ?? ------------------------------

A ballfield( not stars but balls ) with text in the middle with the names
the Syndicate members.

Light sourced pigs, aaaahhh, lines come up..........
It's a cube !!
No not an ordinary cube, nooo, a cube with other objects rotating on all the
four sides !
looks rather nice but doesn't come near watching a pig fly !

Shock !!
Colorschock to be more precise, the screen has a scrolline in the middle and
the colors in the background get replaced from time till time.

Space.......the final frontier

Well what shall be next on the menue ?

A light sourced vectorball with a Syndicate logo in the upper part of the
screen.
The balls spins and after i pressed the spacebar it gets smaller and smaller
and it disappears never to return again( snif ).
After the blackness a picture see's the light and it tells you that the
Syndicate is the force of Lappland .
Nice to know that, but i want to see those pink piggy's fly......NOW !!

------------------------ NOW LET ME GUESS, PIGGY'S !! ----------------------

But noooo, no piggy's but a big logo that comes gliding on the screen.
Underneath that logo is a starfield and then there appear two twisting 
scrolline's on the scene.
After some text the twisters and the logo go away and the next thingy comes
marching in............

We get some figures made out of shaded sine dots and a scrolling message in
the lower part of the screen.
Those dots get replaced by some vertical rasters, they swing a bit and then
they make room for the next effect.

Now we get " A blenk vector cube " as the Syndicate calls it.
It turns out to be a filled cube with some other objects rotating on the
four sides.

Only one part keeps us from the end sequence........
Some changing transparant vector objects get to do their stuff first.
Nothing fancy either.............

----------------------------------- THE END --------------------------------

The chip tune changes and a big Syndicate logo fills the upper part of
the screen, it glides from left to right.
Some vertical text scrolls up with information and the greetings.

That's all folks because there is no reset screen.

I saw no flying pigs, so the Syndicate disappointed me a bit on that point.
To tell you the truth the demo contains not much orginal effects, so i
wasn't very inpressed by it.
The module and the cube with other objects on it was cool, the other stuff
was old and not very stunning.

Some figures to make my point,

Code      : 7+
Graphics  : 8-
Music     : 8
Appeal    : 7

Overall rating : 8-

If god wanted that they could fly, he would have given them wings !

NOTE: In the STE corner is a review of a demo called Tragedy for You that
      also seem to work on a ST, so check it out !
