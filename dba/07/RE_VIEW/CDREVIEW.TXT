                THE BIG INTRO COMPACT DISC REVIEW SPECIAL

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Lots of crews on the ST scene seem to make somekind of compact CD with cracks,
intro/demo's, sources, modules and fonts/pictures these days.
Many people collect those CD's and there are also many people who think they
are not worth looking at.

The main question in this article is: are compils disc pollution or are they
really worth collecting.
I think that the answer is; yes they are worth collecting but only if they
are really good and uptodate !

So i took off to Vigo's house and i asked him to give me some intro CD's for
a big review article that i planned for some time now.
Vigo own's most PD( STe ) stuff in the group and maybe even in this country
( except for the ACN, but they only got lame stuff ) so it was no problem to 
get some CD's that where produced by several groups.
I asked his opinion on compils and he said; there are just to many crappy and 
worthless CD's crews at the moment( I won't tell you what he really said
about them or our magazine will get kept out of England ).

Some of these crews have the potention to write a good megademo or something
else instead of making intro CD menu's !
We looked at more then one compil to make our final conclusion, so don't say 
we didn't look at more then the ones in the review.
I also look if the CD's contain good intro-menu's and if they contain new and 
good intro's and demo's.
Each intro/demo compil will get a rating which will be a quality rating.

We selected the most spreaded menu's and made the following review of it,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GROUP  : RIPPED OFF
NUMBER : 126 and 127


Ripped off is a group from England that make intro/demo CD's for a long time
and they are one of the early intro/demo packing crews.
The disks doesn't always contain new intro/demo's but sometimes they have
some stuff that i haven't seen before.
Okay lets see what's on the disks,

Prelude Demo
TRB Gen 4
Movie Demo
Boot fixer
Copier

On the disk is avarage intro with the usual scrolling message's

----------------------------------- 127 -------------------------------------

The other compil contains a intro that was used several times earlier on 
other CD's from Ripped Off.
It is a avarage intro with some balls flying around and a chip tune.

Menu 127 contains,

The French new year demo
Beachtro
Raster
Comtech

It seems that Ripped Off is packing mostly demo's and they sometime seem to
pack a intro to fill things up.
Lets do some figures to figure it all out........

MENU CODE       : 8- ( AVARAGE, SOMETIMES GOOD )
CONTENTS        : 8- ( THERE IS TOO MUCH OLD STUFF ON THE DISC'S )

OVERALL QUALITY : 8
 
****************************************************************************

GROUP  : THE SOURCE
NUMBER : 104 and 107

Here's another group from England called " the Source " they produce beside's
intro/demo compils also module compils.
They are also sometime on the scene with their compils and they seem still
be going on with them.
The intro's on both CD's are from avarage quality and contain no fancy things.

Compil 104 contains,

TPT Mad Demo
Watchmen intro 1
Watchmen intro 2

As you can see they do both intro's and demo's.

----------------------------------- 107 ------------------------------------

Another avarage intro-menu but the disc contains lots of things like,

Atax +                     Entombed +
Pleasure Dome              Pleasure Dome 2
Hemoroids Dentro           Factory is Dead
Swap by TLS                Crazey PHF intro
Cebit '92 Demo

Source 92 and 101 Bootsector Fixes.

Sometimes they have new stuff but most of the times the compils contains
some older things.
Here we go with those figures and remarks,

MENU CODE       : 7+ ( AVARAGE )
CONTENTS        : 8  ( MORE OLD THEN NEW STUFF )

OVERALL QUALITY : 7+

****************************************************************************

GROUP  : STRANGER
NUMBER : 10 and 11

Stranger is a crew that has it's base of operations in Germany.
It is a rather new group compared with some of the others, they have
mostly new stuff on their disc's.
The menu-intro's become better with each new release but they are still not
that amazing as some of the intro-menu's from other crew(s) in this review.

Compil 10 contains,

Adrenalin            Library
Detonators           POV
FBI                  Sigma
ICS                  Zuul

These are intro's from mostly other compil menu's.

------------------------------------- 11 -----------------------------------

Another avarage intro-menu on this one too, lets see what they bring us,

BBS intro                Tristar
Pulsion                  Condemned Dimensio Demo
Pulsion

It would be rather nice to know which numbers the Pulsion intro's have.
There is not much i can say about these two compiles so i give some ratings,


MENU CODE       : 7 ( AVARAGE )
CONTENTS        : 8 ( MOSTLY NEW STUFF )

OVERALL QUALITY : 7

****************************************************************************

GROUP  : STAX
NUMBER : 28 and 29

Yep another compil group from Germany with lotsa intro/demo compils.
Although some of the intro's are a bit lame but that seems to change now. 
The intro on numer 29 is very good, if go on like this you will probably
be one of the best compil crews around.

Time for a roundup of the contents on 28,

Hospital demo           Ledgers 11 intro
Admirables 6            Probe ST ( ripper )
POV 118                 DNS 2
Cobra 30                Blues Boys 3
F.B.I.                  Elite

Number 28 cotains a rather boring intro.

------------------------------------ 29 ------------------------------------

Here we have one of the best compils i have seen of STAX.
Keep this up because we really liked the intro very much, good work from
a guy called Mike.
All the Stax compils contain new stuff and sometimes some older things too.
We found not only intro's and demo's but also some utility's on the disc's
which is sometimes very usefull indeed.

Lets take a closer look at compil 29, it contains,

Legacy Dentro                 Replicants
D.B.A. mag 6 intro            Contact us
Noisetracker 2.0              D.B.A. interviewer
POV 119                       Zuul Mega Fonts 8
Spiral                        Cynix

Yep those ratings are coming up,

MENU CODE       : 8- ( GOOD )
CONTENTS        : 8  ( MOSTLY NEW STUFF )

OVERALL QUALITY : 8+


****************************************************************************
 
GROUP  : ANIMAL MINE
NUMBER : 43 and 44

A.M. is a group from Germany who produce compils called the : Great Stuff
Compilations( GSC ).
This group make also tooldisks and demo/dentro's on the ST.
The intro's are always from very good quality and the stuff is new !
Most of the intro's are coded by Penguin and M.C. who seem to be the most
active members of A.M. 
For most people the GSC are the best intro/demo compils these days.

On GSC. 43 you can find,

Falcon Demo
Invaders
X-Tream Demo
Treepack 1.7

There are also utility's and PD games on the GSC disc's.

----------------------------------- 44 -------------------------------------

GSC 44 contains lots of stuff,

Aura's Mathematica                   Cynix intro
Hydroxid intro                       ICS intro
Mad Vision Cube 2                    Mad Vision GFX Show

UNT Mag 12 intro                     X-Tream intro

This compil contains a good intro that stay's in memory like all the new
intro's from Animal Mine.
Surtenly one of the best compils around.........

MENU CODE       : 9 ( GOOD/VERY GOOD )
CONTENTS        : 8 ( MOSTLY HOT STUFF )

OVERALL QUALITY : 9-

****************************************************************************

GROUP  : PERSISTANCE OF VISION ( POV )
NUMBER : 123 and 124

Here we've got another good compil crew from England called " POV ".
It seems that this group also helps other compil crews with their 
compil-menu's.
Most intro's from the POV compils are from good quality, they are mostly
coded by Mac Sys Data.

POV 123 contains,

Swingout Sister
Extreme shade bobs
Pulsion 149 and 159
JMP 2
Copier

----------------------------------- 124 ------------------------------------

The compils contain intro's and demo's.
Each compil has a copier on it and sometimes POV also supplies an information
program on the disc's.

On 124 we have,

Fly Tech Demo                  Maths Blaster
JMP 2 (?), 6 and 8             Copier

The compils are always from good quality, that's what the next ratings say,


MENU CODE       : 8 ( GOOD )
CONTENTS        : 8 ( MOSTLY OLDER DEMO/INTRO STUFF )

OVERALL QUALITY : 8-

****************************************************************************

I know that it is hard to make new intro's each time and it gets harder
when you produce more and more compils.
Sometimes it is nice to see our intro's spread on a compil but sometimes
you curse them for taking something from your disc without permission.
Some of the utitily's on our magazine get snatched by others and also spread
by them ( and they take all the credits for it ).

Final conclusion of this big review is that there are to many compil makers.
We have reviewed the most spreaded ones in this articles but there are
ofcourse many more.
If there are groups planning to do also compils disc's : Please don't do it
because we get drowned in them !

Next time we've got module compils in the review corner.
