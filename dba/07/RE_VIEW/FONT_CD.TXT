O'l Slimer has another compil review for you.
I said in the other article that lots of groups make compils these days and
that there are also a lot of people collecting them.
But on the other side there are the people who say; we don't need those
lame compils because there are to many and they are no good.

Intro/demo compils are sometimes nice to collect but are those font compils
also worth to have in your collection ??
Well lets review the best swapped font compils and give them some ratings.

It's up to you to decide if they really are worth your diskspace !

****************************************************************************

GROUP  : MEGABUSTERS
NUMBER : 1

Well i never actual heard of them before so they must pretty new on the
scene or never had any success or luck to get better known.
This compil menu contains no intro, only a slideshow kind of program with
a scrolline.
The program has many features and seems to be written by one their crew
members.

The compil contains loads of ripped fonts from other groups.
I like to see some own fonts too, this make the compils far more interesting.
Lets look at some ratings,

INTRO CODE      : 0 ( NO INTRO )
PIC. DISPLAYER  : 8 ( MANY OPTIONS )
CONTENTS        : 7 ( RIPPED FONTS FROM OTHERS ONLY )

OVERALL QUALITY : 7-

****************************************************************************

GROUP  : IMPACT
NUMBER : 1 and 2

Impact is compil/demo crew from France, these font compils seem to be a
creation from Dadu of Impact.
They call there compils " Nice Fonts " compils and they contain loads of
fonts ripped from several groups.
The compil also contain some fonts from Impact so you could say it's partly
there own ( only 10 % ).
On the compil is no intro, only a slideshow program made by Dadu.

The slideshow program contains no special things, you can press some keys
to see the greetings and to use some options.
Oh yes one last think for i go for the figures, there are some fonts on disk
1 who are also on disk 2 ( including our own font ).


INTRO CODE      : 0 ( NO INTRO )
PIC. DISPLAYER  : 7 ( AVARAGE )
CONTENTS        : 8 ( RIPPED AND OWN FONTS )

OVERALL QUALITY : 7+

****************************************************************************

GROUP  : ZUUL
NUMBER : 8 and 9

Another group from France and they produce " Mega Font " compils.
Finally i get to see some intro's and that's something new on a font disc.
That last bit was a little sarcastic but if you insist of making those compils
why not do a decent job on them ?
When i pressed a key to load the slideprogram i winded up with the slideshow
program from that bloke called Hudson or something ( he coded Degas ).

These compils are the " best " ones that i have encounterd on the ST.
Here the final conclusion,

INTRO CODE      : 7 ( AVARAGE/GOOD )
PIC. DISPLAYER  : 7 ( WELL IT DOES THE JOB )
CONTENTS        : 8 ( MOSTLY RIPPED FONTS )

OVERALL QUALITY : 8-

Those font disc's are nice for those who can't draw or can't rip them.
If you think about it, there must be only a very very small group of people
who really can use these disc's !

Is it really worth producing compils for that small group ??
Plane and Simple: these compils are more then enough, if any group is planning 
to do one, don't bother !!

Both Zuul and Impact also produce other kind of compils also.
Maybe you can better change to demo/utility coding or just make a intro
for our magazine ( maybe make some articles with programming tips ).

I think i'm going to leave you now because a rather watch the late night 
movie on T.V. !
Have fun with the rest of the article's, see ya.........
