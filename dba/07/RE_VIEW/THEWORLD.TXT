Some weeks ago i recieved a small parcel with a little case in it.
In this little case was a disk with some writing on it " preview copy " and
a small booklet ( manual ).
There was also a note with some information about the game and the address
of the Floppy Shop.

There was one sentence in the note that made me real curious,

The game features a large playing area, devious puzzles, creeping fungus, 
rock falls, explosions, an original soundtrack, 50 entry high score table,
40 levels of increasing difficulty, over 40 colours on screen and much more !

I bet that you are as curious now as i was then !
Cool, i don't like to do a half job on this one, so Vigo was invited to my
house to give his opinion on this game too.
He had exactly the same opinion as i had, you can read all about in the
review below( how wonderfull ),

------------------------------ THE LOADER AND INTRO ------------------------

Lets rattle those pots and pans and get this show on the track.....
We get treated with a Floppy Shop logo and after that you get see a logo from
the TPS ( the Pixel Shop ).
Then an intro picture appears on screen accompanied with a good module tune.
The picture isn't that stunning as the ones in front of many other games that
we saw in our computer career ( and man we saw some ) !
Well atleast there is a module tune playing and that makes up for the piccy.

-------------------------------- THE MAIN MENU -----------------------------

In top the screen there is a menu with four (4) options and you can choose
between those options with the joystick.

1. When you " click " on the first option, you will enter the game on the
   currently selected level.

2. With this option you can enter a password to enter a level.

3. This is the highscore department( there are 50 entry's in this high score
   table possible ).
   You can scroll through all the 50 entry's with your joystick and in the
   background are lots of colours to brighten it all up.

4. Click on this one to get a little menu, you can install a datadisc or you
   can listen to the module soundtrack that i mentioned before.

--------------------------------- GAME PLAY ---------------------------------

If you put " Digger Dugger " and " Boulderdash " together you will get pretty
close to this game.
The main purpose of this game is to collect diamonds( shells if under water )
within a surten amount of time.
There are also collectables like fruit, boxes and other kind of objects that
you can use to increase your points with, by taking them.
There are doors that you can unlock by pulling a lever or collecting a key.
In this game are also transporters that will bring you to other parts of the
playing area, there are also scrolls ( that show you the map of the area ).

To make it all a bit more juicy there is Wayne ( a monster ) that will make
your life miserable and he got also some pals helping him out.
You can stop Wayne by blocking his way with a bolder, there are also
bombs and fungus ( kills on contact ).

You must control a guy called " Phineas " trough this quest using your 
joystick, with the spacebar you can pull levers and use the transporters.
the M key gives you a the current status i.e. number of lives, diamonds to 
collect etc.

Are you still with me ??

----------------------------------- THE GAME -------------------------------

We choose option number one and the first level gets loaded.
In the upper right part of the screen is a clock counting down and you get to
see three harts that represent your lives.
On the right side is a counter that counts every piece of dirt/weed that
you remove by walking over/trough it.
While you play you will get to hear a good ( chip ) soundtrack, it's the
same tune as the module track in the intro screen.

With that out of the way, we can begin with some serious game testing.
I ( Slimer ) played it for a some while and it is not an easy game ( even
for a crack like me ).
The playing field is pretty big and you will have a short time to collect
all the diamonds.

You must make " passages " in the playfield and you get chased by Wayne and
his look alikes.
It was hard to outrun Wayne because the controls are not always very accurate.
There are bolders to block those " passages " to prevent Wayne from catching
up with you because our little Wayne is deadly !!
So i run/dig/cut trough the field collecting diamonds/collectables, unlocking
doors and pulling levers.
I made it to the second level where i can't get through within the set time.

You will find yourself in the second level under water with a diving suit
and the diamonds are now shells that you must collect.
To get to the shells you have to cut your way through sea-weed.

In this level i also had the " pleasure " of meeting creeping fungus and
toxic waste.
Several times when i used the Transporter to the other part of the field i
got stuck in the middle of toxic waste or i was instantly attacked by Wayne
and his look alikes.
There is just a bit to much of enemy objects/creatures in the game for my
taste ( but thats my opinion ).

We where also botherd by the jerky scrolling that has a negative effect on  
the gameplay.

We couldn't see very clear where we made those " passages " because the
background colors and the color of the " passages " where almost the same.
Well, Wayne liked it very much because he killed me several times when i
thought i was save !
This gets better in the second level where the background is better drawn.

So, i made to level two, but Vigo didn't made it.......

---------------------------- THE FINAL CONCLUSION --------------------------

                             Negative Comment,

A very good game concept but there are still lots of things that could be
improved( maybe something for Around the World part 2 ?? )
The controls of " Phineas " are not always very accurate and the scrolling
is jerky, having it's bad effect on the gameplay.
The background graphics in the first level is unclear, you can't see what
your doing.
It is a very big and rather difficult game to complete within the set time
and the game creators made to much features in the game !

                             Positive Comment,

Good soundtrack ( both module and chip music ).
Nice to see that there are passwords to enter each level and that there is
a good high score system.
The game concept is good and there is also an option to install a data disk.
When you get stuck you can kill yourself by pressing the ESC, Q or UNDO keys.
I know some games with no exit like this and you have to load it all over
again ( ! ).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a low budget game that is worth the price as you can live with
some of the negative sides of it.
For those of you that play through all the levels is there also a datadisk
with 40 new levels( available soon ).
