GOOD NEW MUSIC

New Music, at last...

Yes for the very first time we have new and original music in the 
magazine. It's made by our new music man called : SONIC.

These 5 numbers are his first products ever released on the Atari (to 
be exact on any computer at all..). Doesn't sound bad at all don't you 
think so. We will tell you more about him in our next issue, perhaps 
even an interview.

But you are still free to send in music we can publish. If you want to 
send some music please remember to send the replay routine also 
(preverable as a source in assembler or in GFA) or state with format 
it is in like .THK or .TRI or what ever.

So try them out these new music and write what you think of them or 
try to do even better....
