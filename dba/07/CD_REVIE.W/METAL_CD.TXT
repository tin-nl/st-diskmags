METAL CD MAGAZINE


          *----- METAL CD MAGAZINE REVIEW VOL. 1/NO. 1 -----*

Yo metal fans there is a NEW metal magazine in the shops called Metal CD.
This is the first time that i actually review a metal/rock magazine but there 
is first time for everything. 
I bought the first issue to check it out and because they gave away a free
CD with tracks from welknown metal bands.
They promise to give away a free CD with every new issue they release !

The magazine has 100 pages full of interviews and reviews which is are quite
interesting to read in my opinion.
In this issue is a big 10 pages special about AC/DC from the present to the
future with piccy's and a complete list of there albums and bootlegs.

There are also interviews with,

* Bon Jovi
* Rollins Band
* Megadeth
* Slash of Guns N' Roses
* Alice in Chains
* Mr. Big

Then there is also a chart of metal albums that made it to number 1.
There are also 50 reviews of albums in this issue and that makes this issue
a real collectors item.

The free CD you get with the magazine is not bad at all, i could even call
it very good, it features more then 50 minutes of music.
It's a mix from old and new tracks from welknown and some lesser known bands.
On this CD are 10 tracks from,

Mr. Big         -- Shy Boy ( Live )
21 Guns         -- These Eyes
Pantera         -- Walk
Motorhead       -- Killed by Death
Great White     -- Psycho City
Rollins Band    -- Obscene
FM              -- Take the Money
Mordred         -- West Country Hospital
Loud            -- Mary ( she made me )
Black Sabbath   -- Sabbath bloody Sabbath

My favourite tracks on this CD are from : 21 Guns, Motorhead, Great White, FM 
and a band called Loud.
The sound quality is different from track to track but remains within the O.K.
range, most tracks have a okay quality though !
21 Guns, FM and Loud have the best recordings while the track Motorhead is
the worst( it's a old song ).

two fans.
These two fans had to sell there houses because they just were fired from
there work( isn't he a cute guy ) !
