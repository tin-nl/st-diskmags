METALLICA CONCERT

     After my review of the "Bad  Boys" bootleg, here is a follow
     up review of Metallica's last concert  in the U.K., this was
     at the Birmingham NEC on November 5th.

     I won't go into detail about how  I got there, save that the
     coach driver managed to drive THROUGH the NEC car park three
     times, needless to  say  this  got  very  frustrating for us
     paying passengers.

     Inside the NEC (National  Exhibition  Centre,  for those who
     don't know)...

     After eating half a cheeseburger  (one  side was cooked, the
     other was stone cold),  and  drinking  a  glass  of cider, I
     managed to find my seat, and  eventually after much time has
     passed, we see,  the  half  hour  presentation video.  Which
     eventually turns into a clip from "The good, the bad and the
     ugly" (for those of you  who  don't  know, it's the standard
     Metallica intro music),  this  causes  great  excitement and
     everyone who's sitting down, stands up...

     And then  goes  ape-shit  when  Enter  Sandman  starts, this
     lead's to over two and a half hours of standing/shouting/
     screaming/clapping/headbanging/dizziness, although  not  all
     at the same time.  If you  want  to know, they played a very
     similar set  to  that  of  the  aforesaid  mentioned bootleg
     (hardly  surprising,  it  is  the   same  tour),  the  MAJOR
     difference being  that  the  original  Diamond  Head line-up
     joined Metallica on stage to  jam  two songs for the encore.
     Those being Am I evil, and  Helpless, although they seemed a
     little nervous they provided a memorable performance.

     So, I've described some of  the  details,  but how can I put
     into words the  loudest,  heaviest,  most  visually exciting
     concert I've been to,  I  can't  really.   Here  is a (crap)
     interpretation of the (excellent, innovative) stage set...

                           ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

                               audience


     This is not at all to scale  or anything like that, the drum
     kit moves down the two  long  diagonal  bit, the * represent
     rough position of mike stands,  and  there  is also a raised
     walking platform over the snake  pit  area.  (I apologize to
     anyone who's  seen  the  stage  you'll  know  how  stupid it
     look's, but this is the best I can do.)

     I've  forgotten  the  (starting  to  get  compulsory)  video
     screens, these were suspended  above  the  stage (along with
     all the lighting and speaker rig's), and where positioned so
     that everyone could see  at  least  one  of them.  They were
     used to show the opening  vid  and  other footage during the
     show, the best bit I remember was during 'One', although the
     images that were shown were  simple,  the impact they had on
     me, when combined with the song, was quite considerable.

     Not forgetting the  flash  bombs  and  general pyrotechnics,
     these included a number  of  six  (!)  feet  high columns of
     flame, smoke bombs,  flash  bombs,  and  a  excellent strobe
     effect during 'One' (again!).

     Quite simply, this is one  of  the  best three concerts I've
     been to, you can guarantee  I'll  be  in  the que for a seat
     next time, even if it's in four years time.

     10 out of  fukin'  10  (incase  you  hadn't  got the message
     already).
