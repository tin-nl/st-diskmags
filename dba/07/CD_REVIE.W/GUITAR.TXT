                    ********* GUITAR SPECIAL *********
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time i have a little special about some CD's from two welknown guitar
players.
For many people these two guys are the best guitar players on earth.
You are probably begin to wander about which guitar hero's i'm talking here,
okay they are: Joe Satriani and Yngwie J. Malmsteen.

People who are not familiar with these two guitar hero's and like to listen
to heavy guitars must simply buy a CD from one of those two guys.
Lets start with the review of the two CD's,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTIST             : JOE SATRIANI
TITEL OF CD        : SURFING WITH THE ALIEN
RECORDING          : 1987 AAD
NUMBER OF TRACKS   : 10
TOTAL PLAYING TIME : 37:37

This is probably one of the better CD's that Joe Satriani has produced in
his career.
On this CD are 10 instrumental tracks of very good quality, the CD features
some heavy tracks and some more soft romantic kind of tunes.
Joe also uses some synthesizers in some of his tracks, so it is not only
guitars and drums you will hear in his songs.
The most known track on this CD is the song called: Surfing With The Alien.

You can find a sample of this track on the Salon de la Micro Demo by the
Overlanders( so take a look in your diskbox or order it from us or any PDL ).
The CD contains the following tracks,

Surfing With The Alien                 Ice Nine
Crushing Day                           Always With Me, Always With You
Satch Boogie                           Hill Of The Skull
Circles                                Lords of Karma
Midnight                               Echo

Joe Satriani his songs contain much melody and is very listenable music.
Surfing With The Alien, Nine Ice, Crushing Day, Satch Boogie, Lords of
Karma are all " heavy " rocksongs.
Always With Me, Circles and Echo are more softer and tracks with a good
melody line.
The two songs; Hill of the Skull and Midnight are short tracks with some
strange kind music effects in it.

It is well worth buying this excellent CD which features some amazing guitar
playing and proves that Satriani is a amazing cool guitar axe !

You can reconise the CD on the picture with the white man( alien ? )surfing
on a surfboard( looks a bit like Iceman the superhero ).
The picture is red, white, yellow and some blue, it will catch the eye very
quickly when you are looking for it.

ARTIST             : YNGWIE J. MALMSTEEN
TITEL OF CD        : RISING FORCE
RECORDING          : 1984 AAD
NUMBER OF TRACKS   : 8
TOTAL PLAYING TIME : 39:39 

This is a completly different kind of music if you compare this with Joe
Satriani.
Some songs even contain vocals and some synthesizer sound to back it all up.
Yngwie makes rockmusic with an other kind of melody line, you can say that
Joe uses more conventional melody lines than Yngwie does.
The vocals on the two songs on this CD is done by Jeff Scott Soto and this
guy sounds a bit like James the leadsinger of Metallica.
I had some trouble reading the shitty font they use on the CD cover.
Okay there are 8 tracks on this shiny disc,

Black Star                     Far Beyond The Sun
Now Your Ships Are Burned      Evil Eye
Icarus' Dream Suite op.4       As Above, So Below
Little Savage                  Farewell

Some of the songs are a bit symphonic orientated and are less heavy then Joe
Satriani his more straight rocksongs.
Only two tracks contains vocals: Now your Ships Are Burned and As Above, So
Below.
Farewell is a short acoustic track that shows what Ygnwie can do on an
acoustic guitar.
The syntesizer is often used to make church organ kind of sounds something
like the music used in old horror ( Dracula ) movies.

Malmsteen has a different style then Satriani, i personally like Joe more
then Yngwie because of his nice melody's.
But Malmsteen is surtenly a real guitar axe !!

You can reconise the CD on the cover with an arm holding a guitar that seems
to rise out of the flames.
Well worth to check out.........

in the next issue's.

People who like house, rapp and that sort of stuff can send their reviews
also to us because i don't have anything in my collection of this.
There seem to be many people who like this sort of music and we want to give
some attention to this form of music too !
All other kind of music styles are also welcome in the CD corner.
