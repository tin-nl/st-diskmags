                             RUMOURS
------------------------------------------------------------------

This  is  the Films-That-Probably-Might-Appear  and  really  wild 
rumours part.

SCHWARZENEGGER

Sweet Tooth has been set back due to rewrites,  he will make  The 
Last Action Hero instead.

The  Last  Action  Hero is about a pre-teen fan  that  joins  his 
hero  on the silver screen and teaches him to  be  nice.  (sounds 
like T2 to me)

Spiderman might be the next movie where he rejoins James Cameron, 
Arnold is planed to play Dr. Octopus.

Other films Arnold is rumoured to be involved in:  Oh Baby, Judge 
Dreed,  Blade Runner 2 and a film about the crusades 


EVIL DEAD III

The  rumours has it that it is in filming,  Campbell  is  driving 
around in the middle ages in a souped up 'Death Mobile'  shooting 
his shoot gun and killing monsters left and right with his  chain 
saw.


HELLRAISER III: HELL ON EARTH 

It is said that this film is in production,  but who knows!  Hell 
is by the way a place 2 miles away from Trondheim in Norway.


THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3

Out next year if the rumours are true. 


NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1

Parody  of  Lethal Weapon staring Emilio Estevez  and  Samuel  L. 
Jackson. And i always thought that Lethal Weapon 2 was a parody!


WILDER NAPALM     

Two  brothers  with pyrochinetic powers battles it out  over  the 
love of a girl.  The Girl is Debra Winger and one of the brothers 
is Dennis Quaid (i think).
