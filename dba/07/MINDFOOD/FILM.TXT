FILM REVIEW

Lethal Wepon 3

This is a very action packed film, it starts with a BIG building 
exploding, and get's more destructive from then on.  The plot this 
time is about an ex-cop how has turned to crime and how the two 
heroe's (played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, as ever) try to stop 
him.  I think this will be one of the biggest movies of 1992, it has 
been advertised a lot, and it's enjoyable to watch aswell.


House Sitter

This is the latest Steve Martin film, and also stars Goldie Hawn.  
Basicly Housesitter is a one joke film about an architect (Steve 
Martin) how builds a house for his childhood sweet heart, in the 
hope that she will eccept it as an engagement gift.  She dosn't.  
Stve then meats a waitress (Goldie Hawn) who has more front than 
Axel Fowley, together they create a completly ficticious marrage 
with predictably crazy results.  This is not Steve Martins best 
film, although it does have some good gags in it


I've just heard that one of the film's that'll be released in 
Europe next summer will be Loaded Weapon, a Lethal Weapon piss-take.
