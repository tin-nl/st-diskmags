MATT'S JOKES
----------------------------------------------------------

A young student starts work at a well knowen Swansea hostelry and is warned
about the local Deaf Society who take the place over every Monday night.
There is a signal system, one finger for a pint, two fingers for a short,
three for crisps and four for peanuts. The student slow on the up-take, gets
a bit behind towards the end of the night. He then notices some of them
banging their hands and feet and opening and shutting their mouths at an
alarming rate. Very worried by this , he goes out of the back to get the
landlord. He explains the situation to which the landlord exclaims " Oh God,
they've started singing, we'll never get rid of them now."

"The largest number of Supreme Court trials deal with motor vehicle
injury claims, so anything that speeds up the process will have an
impact."

      (as quoted in the Fall 1989 issue of WestWorld)

There is a person drowning in a lake, 50 feet from shore.


A Republican throws a 25 foot rope, and tells him to swim to it.

A Democrat throws a 50 foot rope, then drops his end to go do another
good deed.

Thought for the day: Prevention of Cruelty to Piranhas:

A video dealer in England advertised a large discount on his systems to
anyone who was brave (?) enough to snatch a coin from an aquarium filled
with hungry piranha.  The English equivalent of the SPCA in the United
States got into the act and demanded the dealer be sure the customer's hands
were cleaned so as to prevent food poisoning in any piranha that might bite
a dirty hand.

 They are, however, unwilling to forgive her for being in Barbarella."

An acquaintance of mine was active with the New Jersey Taxpayers Union
when former Gov. Brendan Byrne was trying to start a state income tax.
Byrne had given his speech, and asked for questions from the audience,
and Cathy got up and asked "How much money do you guys want?"
Byrne: "What?"
Cathy: "You keep raising taxes and raising taxes again.  When are
you going to stop?  You're already taking 50% of my income in taxes
- what will it take to satisfy you?  60%? 80%? 90%?  How much do you
guys want?"
Byrne: "I can't answer that kind of question."

    Q: Where in Texas is the best place to be?
    A: Deep in the heart(middle) - because no matter which way you're
       going, you're leaving.

Then there was the Texan who was showing a Yankee acquaintance around Austin.
The Yankee pointed to a statue and asked who it represented.  The Texan
replied, "Why that's a Texas Ranger!  This particular guy personally put down
three indian uprisings, captured 73 criminals, rescued 25 lost pioneers, and
helped 273 old ladies across the street.  And all of this single handedly."

Well, of course, the Yankee is suitably impressed, "Wow.  That is something.
But you know we have our local heroes up North too.  For instance, you've
probably heard of Paul Revere."

The Texan looks pensive for a moment then says, "Sure,  isn't he the guy who
had to ride for help?"

We heard last week about a new parachute design that came out of the ME dept.
at Texas A&M.

It opens on impact....

Thought for the day: Diet Tips from Ann Landers

(These are excerpts from an old column.  Apologies to those who may have
seen them already, but they are timeless, and worthy of repeating.)

1. If no one sees you eat it, it has no calories.

2. If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, they will cancel each other out.

----------------------------------------------------

In the spirit of "Diet Tips from Ann Landers", this sign was seen on the
menu board at the Florentine Restaurant in Cupertino:

"A waist is a terrible thing to mind ... so don't forget to splurge with
 dessert."

There were these two guys, Bill and Fred.  They decided to open up a resort on
an island, so they bought a small, uninhabited Hawaiian Island.  Well, the
first thing they built was an ice cream stand.  Fred was painting the stand,
while Bill worked below.  Fred accidentally dropped the can of red paint on
Bill's head.  Bill had a very short temper, so Fred rushed down the ladder, ran
to the boat and sped away.
    Bill found himself marooned on a dessert island
