JOKES

Here are some jokes from gues who?:

Miss A.S. and O.T.M. (brother and sister in braincrime !?!)
But before we terrorise your brains first a storie.

A few weeks ago Bonus invited me to go to Eindhoven. There was 
a fair and offcourse there where lotsa atari freaks. So we 
arranged some transport the night before we left. We all went 
with a guy called Luc. The next morning I left for Bonus his 
place. At his place he told me that Slimer would be late coz 
the train was delayed. 

What? Slimer also went to the fair? Hang on a sec. Bonus (1)
K.G.E.(2) Luc(3) O.T.M.(4) Slimer (5). Well this will be the 
trip of the year. But there was some hope left, K.G.E. wasn't
feeling so well last night so there was just a change that
there still would be some room left in the car. (Luc's car
is build for four persons max.) But then the doorbell rang
Hello here we are! Oops 2 people argh: "Hi K.G.E. feeling better
today?" -Yep got one  hour more sleep last night. (That's another
storie.) A few minutes later we picked Slimer up from the 
station and went of for Eindhoven. And what do desperate people
do in an full car? YES they tell jokes to kill time (AAAARGHH).
I was going for a home run that day I was telling 80% of all 
jokes and the guyz just laughed or tried to join me. So Slimer
forced me to write jokes for the mag.

So that's the storie but there was one problem left, I know 
thousands of jokes, (And still do my homework, play Judo, and
trie to terrorise the 68000) but I need some help digging them
out of the brainzzz. I cannot just write them down, I have to 
hear other jokes, so I asked my sister to help me.

An old woman wants to have sex with her husband for the last
time.
So puts on sexy underwear, and a sexy gown and goes early
to bed. When her husband arrives at the bed, he takes of his
clothes, puts out the light and goes to sleep.
The woman is a bit pissed off, and the next evening she only
puts on the sexy underwear, and goes to bed. The same thing
as last night happens: the man falls asleep without looking at
her. She really wants to have sex, so the next evening she 
doesn't wears anything, and pushes the blankets away. 
She is laying there completely nude, and when her husband
arrives at the bed, he says: "I don't know what you are wearing,
but it needs ironing."

And now a storie: Once upon a time there was a sad horse.
It's owner didn't like it this way, and promised anyone
who could make the horse happy a thousand dollars.
A man excepted the challenge and went into the barn of 
the horse. When the man came out everybody thought the man
had failled the challenge. 
Suddenly the horse laughed as loud as it could, and the man
earned his money. 
A week later the owner of the horse thought that the horse
was to funny, and didn't like it anymore, coz the horse had
laught through the whole week.
Anyone who could make the horse sad again earned a thousand
dollars. 
The same man took the challenge again and when he got out of
the barn again the horse was sad again.

"Before I give you my money" said the owner "you have to tell me

was bigger than his."
" Yes, yes continue houw did you make him sad?"

A farmer couldn't tell the difference between his two horses.
To avoid this problem he cut 10 cm of one of the horses tails.
It went well for a week, but suddenly the tail started to
grow, and reached it's old size after a few weeks.
The farmer had the same problem as before, and went looking
for another solution for his problem.
The answer to his problem was in the size of the horses:
The brown horse was 30 cm shorter than the white one.
