INTRODUCTION
************

Due through a severe screwup I lost some of the articles I wrote for the
Hi-Fi corner on my Hard-Disk.
Guess what, almost 11 years of computer expierence and still I forget
to back the articles up !
I won't tell how I screwed up because it's to embarising to tell you.
Anyway, it happend and there was nothing I could do about it, then to
reformat the complete Hard-Disk.
Lucky I had made a backup of two of my most important partitions and after
some struggeling and cursing half of the old stuff is back on the HD.
Life can be a bitch, but I decided to rewrite some articles although i'm
not very motivated.


AMPLIFIERS
**********

I bought myself a new amplifier sometime ago.
Before I made a choice I had to test a couple of other amps. first in order
to make a decent selection.
In the previous article that is lost was a story about some problems
around some amplifiers and the involved shops.
All amplifiers you will read about in this article are tested at home and
some in the shop.
Anyway as I said i'm not motivated enough to type it all over again, so we
keep it short and simple !

I tested the best amps beneath the 900 pounds and these are the,

NAD 3240
CYRUS ONE
ARCAM DELTA 3

ONKYO A 8015


The Onkyo amplifier has been bought by a friend and will be tested later
on in this article against the winning amp.(gna gna gna)
I will make short review of all the seperate amplifiers involved in this
test.
So lets start off with the first one,

---------------------------- THE CYRUS ONE -------------------------------

Price: around the 400 pounds


Mission/Cyrus is an English firm producing Hi-Fi equipment, the firm is
owned by Sansui.
There is a lot of confusion about the name Mission\Cyrus but I will try to
explain what the difference is.
You could say that Mission stuff is cheaper and aimed at the bigger market
and Cyrus is more high-end stuff!

Both brands are seperate from eachother but produced by the same firm !

The Cyrus amplifiers aren't produced anymore.
Both the successful Cyrus one and two are replaced by other amps.
who are more exclusive and expensive.
The manufacturer has decided to produce more high-end components instead
of the cheaper low-end series.
However there is still a chance that you can buy one of the amps. in the
shops.
With the Cyrus One amps, the firm had one the most successful amplifiers 
on the market.
But the competitors are not sleeping and after some years the old Cyrus
wasn't cabable to compete with the amps. on market anymore.
The amplifier still is one of the better amplifiers beneath the 900 pounds
but one of the most expensive ones though.


LOOKS & LISTENING,
******************

SETUP,

Speakers  : BNS E14
CD player : Sony CDP 591

OCF Interlink between the CD player and the amplifier.
OCF cable between the amps and the speakers.

The Cyrus one looks like something from the militairy, it's heavy
has cooling ribs and is quite small.
There are only a few knobs on it for the most important functions like
volume, channel left/right, input and output selectors.
However there isn't a headphone jack on the amplifier which I find rather
strange. 

But looks don't say everything about an amplifier, you buy one for sound.
Well, the amplifer has a warm sound and an average stereo spreading area.
I found that it lacked the detail and brightness I personally like to hear
in music.
The amplifier is quite powerful and well balanced.

Conclusion,

The amplifier is a bit outdated in comparison with some of the others in
this article.
Most new amplifiers have better looks and features for a cheaper price
then the Cyrus one.
The sound of those amps are on the same level or even higher (depending on
personal taste).  
I miss the detail and brightness i'm looking for, so it's not my first choice.
Cyrus has sold many of the one and two series over the years with much
success but it looks like those days are gone........


Power Rating : 2 X 40 watts

----------------------------- Arcam Delta 3 ------------------------------

Price: around the 320 pounds

Arcam is also a firm from England but is the least known from all the names
mentioned in this article.
They produce however exellent Hi-Fi components for a reasonable price and
quality.
Every component is made by hand and the inside of for instance the ampli-
fiers are just perfect.
This in comparison with the others in this article who are assembled by
machines in a factory.
Within the Arcam Delta 3 is a very big ring transformer which is quite to
heavy for the little amplifier.
However it seems to lead to a richer and more pure sound.
There is another amplifier in the Delta serie and that's the Delta 5 which
has more power and even better sound.

LOOKS AND SOUND
***************

The Delta 3 has all the knobs and buttons that you will find on the
average amplifier.
There is tone control, balance and even a headphone jack present on this
little but normal looking amplifier.
In comparison with the Cyrus is the Arcam light in weight with the normal
thin metal case and the plastic front.

I had both the Cyrus and the Arcam at home for a test, this had something
to do with a small bet.
Both amplifier came from different shops and the shop that sold the Arcam
claimed that it was better then the Cyrus.
So, I took them both home to hear it for myself and also to report to both
the shops about the results.
The first amplifier I tried was the Cyrus and after that I hooked up the
Arcam.
The Cyrus was a bit disappointing and the Arcam was very suprising.

The amplifier has warm sound and has also very much detail but lacked
decent stereo spreading.
One major positive thing about the Arcam is that it is a very musical amp.
that really makes you tap your feet.
Sometimes the Arcam gets a bit lazy and it seems not willing to play with
some "spunk".
It's seems to be holding back a bit with some music pieces.

Conclusion,

An amplifier with all the nessacary knobs and button and a headphone jack.
Warm and detailed sound but with to small sounding stereo spreading.
The Arcam is not always very willing to throw out the music and this makes
a sometimes lazy amplifier.
It's also a little bit overpriced in comparison with an NAD amplfier of the
same price.

Power Rating : 2 X 40 watts

------------------------------ NAD 3240 ---------------------------------

Price: around the 420 pounds

NAD is another britisch quality product.
The firm is wellknown for their high quality amplifiers for a very low
price.
This could be done by designing the amplifiers in England and producing
them in oriental country's.
NAD has the policy to let outside experts design their components and
that leads to good results and low costs.
The firm has made some remarkable inventions in the past times making
the NAD components stick out above the rest.
Things like Power Envelope and Soft Clipping makes NAD amplifiers what
they are.
Both features are explained in detail in a previous issue of the D.B.A.
magazine ( issue 2 or 3 ).
Anyway this 3240 was the last one in the shop because it's replaced by a
new series of NAD amps.
I heard that the new amps are extremly good and the expensive one in the
series has MOS endstages !


LOOKS AND SOUND
***************

NAD don't seem to care to much about the design of their stuff, they
care more about the quality.
Although the amplifiers look a bit strange, there are a wide variety
of features on them.
Besides the useal knobs and buttons there are also filters and the option
the connect two pairs of speakers.
There is a headphone jack and there is the possibility to connect the 3240
to an end-amplifier.

The 3240 is quite a big amplifier and a very powerful one too.
It's one the most expensive one of all the NAD amplifiers but I got it 75
pounds cheaper.
Orginally I tested the little "brother" of the 3240 and was quite
impressed by it.
It was just as expensive as the Arcam but had better stereo spread, detail
and it was willing to play without getting lazy.
The only little 'weakness' of the NAD amplifiers the lack of low (bass)
but this was compensated by my Sony CDP 591(it's bass is a bit boosted up).
I found later that the 'Bass EQ' button amplifies the lower frequencies, this
is particulary usefull with small speakers for extra bass.

I have bought the 3240 amplifier for the same price as it's little brother
(NAD 3225 PE)and i'm very satisfied with it.
The 3240 has some more power, features and is sligtly better in sound.
It's capable of playing rock as well as classical music without any
difficulties.
Amplifiers like the Arcam and the Cyrus had sometimes problems with the
different forms of music.
The NAD in comparison with the Arcam is very willing to play anything you
like without any problems.

Conclusion,

For the price I gave for the 3240 it is the absolute top amplifier.
But even if you pay the normal price for it, it will still be one of the
best amplifiers that money can buy in it's class.
It has everything I search for in an amplifier, from the headphone jack till
the (really) necassary buttons and knobs.
The NAD has power, detail and brightness combined with "spunk" and a good
stereo spreading area !

Power Rating : 2 X 40 watts

----------------------------- ONKYO A 8015 ------------------------------

Price: around the 700 pounds

One of my mates had decided to buy another amplifier and he saw a second
hand one in the shop.
It was an Onkyo in very good shape and approx. 4 years old for a reasona-
ble price.
His previous amplifier was a Yamaha and he thought that the Onkyo would
give him only a tiny musical improvement.
When we tested the Onkyo it became clear that the thing was lightyears
ahead on the old Yamaha.
He had bought the Onkyo in the same week as when I bought my NAD 3240.

The Onkyo is a real powerhouse cabable of producing 105 watts of constant
musical power.
Freaks as we are, we decided to put the NAD and the Onkyo against eachot-
her for a musical match.
There would be sound difference as the Onkyo is a Japanese amp. and the NAD
is Britisch.

LOOKS AND SOUND
***************

The Onkyo has lots of knobs, buttons, switches and other sometimes rather
useless features(typical Japenese).
It's big and heavy and it's completly black looking as heavy as it is !
For a powerhouse it sounds suprisingly clear with much detail and "spunk".
Four years ago the Onkyo was about 650 pounds new and the the NAD 3240
is around 420 pounds.

You can read the conclusion in the MATCH part.


Power Rating : 2 X 105 watts


THE MATCH
*********  

SETUP,

Speakers  : Onkyo (type unknown)
CD Player : An old Sony 16 bit player.

Cables    : OCF interlinks and cable between the components and speakers

I took my NAD 3240 with me to my friend for our little match.
We started off with his amplifier by playing some music that we're both
very familier with. 
After that we connected the NAD to his Onkyo it became quite clear that
the NAD sounded more musical.
It became clear when we taped our feet on the music playing through the
NAD and we didn't feel the urge with the Onkyo that much. 
The stereo spreading area was also better and bigger than that of the
Onkyo.

You could say that the Onkyo is made to be a powerhouse and the NAD for
detailed listening purposes.
Although the NAD is "only" 40 watts it is capable of giving burst's till
180 watts(at 8 Ohm)thanks to it's Power Envelope feature.
