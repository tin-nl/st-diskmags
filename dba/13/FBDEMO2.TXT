LOST BLUBB DEMO BY LAZER                Only be afraid of no progress at all'
========================
      by Slimer

Lazer is without a shadow of doubt, beside E.K.O. the top demo coding group on
the Falcon. Last year they presented their excellent "Autowashen Verboten"
megademo at the Fried Bits 2 party, and won first price ! Now they exceed
even that demo by showing an even better one called "Lost Blubb". This a
somewhat curious name for this masterpiece of skill and design. I must state
first that this demo isn't released yet but, we managed to review it anyway.
You might wonder how we pulled that off (we haven't got a copy of it and we
haven't taken any notes) !? Well, it doesn't really matter now does it ??
D.B.A. moves in mysterious ways ...

The demo is reviewed by taking some highlights because the article becomes
even more boring if I describe every detail. Several backgrounds and effects
pass the revue, they are sometimes based on the same concept and thus boring
to describe over and over again ! 
The review is written hastily because of our deadline ...


REVIEW

The demo starts with a menu from which you can choose 5 buttons, addresses,
toggle speaker, start demo etc. In the background of this menu is a picture
which also could be found in the F.B. 3 picture competitions. After you
choose *start* the loading process begins ...

From a blue fog, the black silhouette of woman's figure appears. She comes
walking towards the viewer. In the meantime the module has kicked in, and a
rather good one too ! The screen goes black and several effects in the form
of 3D objects and other assorted stuff are shown for a few seconds at the
time. 

A Stardust alike tunnel is next, complete with flying objects closely
followed by 3 3D objects from which I don't have a clue how to describe them.
A hand zooms in while it rotates. All effects follow each other with great
speed and sometimes get repeated. The dancing silhouettes of the women are
shown throughout the whole demo with changing backgrounds (i.e. dotshowers,
colorcycle effects, distorted backgrounds and the lot !). Several different
'fills' are shown within the silhouette and 'shadow' effects are added here and
there.

The tension of the demo is slowly raising while it proceeds. Little by little
the shown effects are getting more and more spectacular. At the end of the
demo we see multiple screen backgrounds and the women in full color. If I'm
correct there are two women dancing in this demo, they morph from the one to
the other with regular intervals. All animations are moving perfectly to the
effects shown on screen. Kaleidoscope effects, mirrors, multiplying back-
grounds and so on, get thrown at you while the women keep dancing in front
of them. It's accompanied throughout the demo by an excellent and original
module.

The end part contains a girl dancing in some kind of Mexican dress (very
colorful) while the credits and greetings get projected on screen. 

CONCLUSION

You could describe the demo in a few words, it's like a videoclip which you
sometimes encounter on MTV. The demo is original and has a high degree of
style. Lazer has certainly set the new standard in demo coding (thank god). I
must also say that I admire the girls that done the dancing, singing (in the
mod. !) and the design. I really wished that we had more women on the
demoscene. There is only one remark you can make about this demo and that
it's title, it somehow doesn't fit this excellent production ...

CODE     : 9  (for perfect timing and excellent effects)
GRAPHICS : 8+ (Most things were filmed and cut out)
MUSIC    : 9  (Excellent and fitting module !)

OVERALL  : 9 (For absolute style and class ! )

EKO 3D ENGINE (preview)
=======================


Sorry bout' the title forgot the name of this production ... There was a
second price winner at the Fried Bits party although the difference was only
a few percent. E.K.O. shook the Falcon scene with their mind boggling 3D
demostration. The viewers were gasping for breath while they witnessed an
amazing virtual 3D world. Well, what's all the fuss about then ??

REVIEW

E.K.O. takes you on a journey through a vast amount of 3D tunnels in some sort 
of spacestation. We saw big open spaces(hangars) complete with spaceships and 
the lot. At the end of the tunnel is a 3D Doom alike surrounding were we flew 
around a bit. It all looks quite smooth and nice. 

There is an interlude between the next part of the 3D world and this one. In
this interlude some small 3D demostration's are shown like several gourad
shaded objects flowing through each other. There is also a tiny 
landscapegenerator that form the characters E.K.O. 
Well before you know it we'd entered the next exciting part ... 

It's some sort of open construction were you fly through, looks cool. The next 
part is another short interlude ! What follows is a short demostration of some 
smaller 3D effects. Some 3D characters and objects (apple) are flying over the 
screen. But then the real fun starts ...

It's time for a virtual 3D world. It's complete with mountains, trees, a road, 
bridges, tunnels and the lot. First we drive on the road with a reasonable 
speed and make a few laps. On a bridge we suddenly stop and we are lifted from 
it, only to make a trip on the river. Incredible, the river is complete with 
ships ! At the end of the river-trip, we go for a flight over the whole 
landscape and are left ,totally knocked, of our socks in the desktop ...   

CONCLUSION

I think that they also deserved the first place because this was also quite
cool. It's not possible to judge this demo because it's only a review ! We
do it anyway ...
 
CODE     : 9+ (The best 3D ever seen on the Falcon)
GRAPHICS : 8  (Incredible 3D stuff)
MUSIC    : 9- (The module was also excellent)

OVERALL  : 9 (Totally mind blowing ! )
