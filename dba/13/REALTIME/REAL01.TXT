------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First we start with a list of people/groups who where on the party.
The names are not in alfabetic order because the list of names on my paper
is a bit confusing to read from.

Hemoroids       ( Aardschock )
Synergy         ( Arcade, B.A.T., Stash, Mandrome, Rapido, Wingleader, Chrome,
                  Scavenger and Zanac )
Sentry          ( Eagle, Mac, Iso, Ultimate and Toon )
D.B.A.          ( Bonus, O.T.M. and Slimer )
Hotline         ( Lowlife and Sledge )
Elite(endo)     ( Radium and Grimlock )
Galtan 6        ( CIA )
Synth Dream     ( Dr. B )
The Respectables( Tyrem )
TEX             ( Daryl )
SOD             ( Cthulu, Duke, Blasphemer and Ccomm ) 
Animal Mine     ( M.C. and Penguin )
Odessy          ( Vulture and Digital Coolness )
Aenigmatica     ( Jan W. )
Giants          ( Goof, Fox and Havoc )
ICS             ( ZX )

The Joker

There where some other guys too, but i we have no names of them on the paper
list( someone of M.C.A., Stephan Posthuma and others ).
It could also be that some of the names are wrong ( hey i'm not perfect )!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,  This is O.T.M. I'm a bit late, but I had to work on the 
night shift. But till sofar it seems I haven't missed anything, 
I have the honours of starting the real-time article which is a bit
overdue, but this is due to the fact that Bonus was to lazy to start
it up, and after having done this nice piece of realtime ASCII-
Graphics I O.T.M. of the D.B.A. have the honours to type something
interesting, but my brainzzz are empty at this moment. 
For I go any further I would like to thank some people: Roland 
Heerschop (thanks man for getting me through the fucking night at
Kornelis Kunsthars Produkties Steenwijk B.V. etc...) The longhairy
dude that was over there too!!!, He invented a new stupid wordgame
which kept us busy for an hour, and at that moment it was 2 o' clock
in the morning. O yeah, and the guy with the funny face and a Porsche 
too, for clocking me out, so that I could sleep an hour longer.
And now the Mega-Mega-Mega-Mega-Mega-Mega-Mega FUCKINGS, they go:
to Kornelis Kunsthars Produktie Steenwijk B.V., (For letting me work 
all through the night.) And to the Dutch Railway station (For letting
me for more than three hours in the most noisy train...) But what the
Heck, I'm there so 
PPPPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTYYYYYYYYY.
Have a Good LiVe!!!!.

15:34

Hehe, finally there is a computer available for DBA Magazine.... ... ..
Well, many Snes compu's over here. Out of inspi. - AnGElO -

15:51

Jess jess, another realtime article for the DBA Magazine has started. And now
I've gotta write something for it. Well, this party is now going on for about 
a day and I'm already bored. Many Falcons here but still boring. Ah well...
Life sucks... (Jess, I'm really bored). HVC'93

15:56

Well I guess it's my time to write something more or less practical here.
My name is D.C (that's short for digital coolness (yess I know it's a stupid
name, but I made it up when I was 13 years old, so blame it on my age!!!))
Some factual info on MOI: I am one of the two members in Odyssey Creative
 Design. All da grafix in our produx are by me, there not great but as I am 
the only grafix-man (person,artist,...) in our crew, it'll have to do.
Dis shit is being typed on an 1040STf using that very stupid program tempus.
As you can tell I am very happy coz I'm writing in this article.
Havov is sitting next to me looking very amused at the screen of a Falcon,
he's playing around with the desktop, very interesting boy, this havoc guy
kinda strange, but hey. Currently our coder ,Vulture, is working on a screen 
for Synergy, it's our first and last product on the ST since we exist.
Odyssey c.d. was formed about 1.5 years ago and we haven't made an impact
on the scene yet, but we hope to continue on the falcon and really produce 
something worth the while. Well i hope to have entertained you for a few
minutes (seconds,pico-seconds,....) and see you around , D.C signing off...

16:17

Ah well... Here I am again, it's Havoc (cheer! cry! whatever!). I've just been
looking at Slimer's Falcon and I must say that it's a strange machine. It 
bombs at nearly every program I've ran sofar. Furthermore (bleeuargsghfh) I 
think that everybody is misusing the colors in the desktop. All those colored 
icons wouldn't have been so bad if everybody used them the same way, but they 
don't. For instance, the icon Slijmbal uses for a few subdirectories is the 
same as most other guys use for HD utils. Everybody is so happy about their 
coloured icons that I wonder when all those shitty screensavers from MSWindows
will be converted... This was Havoc boring you for a few seconds (megaseconds,
hexaseconds, teraseconds...).

16:19

Chrome/Synergy here, quite a nice party this is. Been quite comfortable
all through, I've got a good place to sleep and it's allowed to drink beer
and other stuff. Not like the party in Hamburg! I don't know much more to
write, beside that I'm having a good time and that's what counts.

16:23

Well, this is Eagle of Sentry. Sorry that we had to miss one day of the party
in this realtime-article, but we realy had no computer to do it on.
This party is quit 'koud' at the moment and there is a good atmosphere.
What a miss for the guys who went for the 'big' Amiga-party in Hamburg, coz'
I am absolutely sure that it ain't half as much fun as this one. Well I am
leaving this computer to set up the SNES-Competition which is at 16:30.

16:29 

Mac of Sentry here. I just came walking in here (couldn't come yesterday).
Immediately my STF was taken from me, 'coz they needed a compu for this 
realtime article they said. And this while I was full of good intentions, like
drawing piccy's and stuff.
Well around this time everybody is snessing around here, in particular some 
beat 'm ups, so I'm getting a bit mad of all the kick 'n beat sounds. Combine 
this with some sort of undefined dance music blasting out of 4 speakers and
you'l know why it's hard to keep this up for three days. But I must say this 
party is cool so far. However, tonight between about twelve and four I'll be
somewhere else, checking out a chic I haven't seen in 6 weeks. OK out of words
now, so see you.
 
16:50

Hi D.C here and next to me is sitting Iso (YEAH!!) of Sentry
he says to me that Iso has to be spelled with those tiny characters coz
else everyone will think it's an afkorting (short for something).
Well Iso will type something now, coz I'm out of really good ideas to 
Tease popples wiz.(a lietel biet of dutsj frentsj,komop isootje tiepe.!!!)
Hajloo!! Errrrrrr... Oh, D.C. says that the beer at the party sucks, I don't
think so (Oranjeboom ...)

Well, a nice pardy so far but it's a shame so much non-Dutch people didn't
show up here but it's a nice pardy anywee. Well, the music you are listening
to is made by someone you MUST know (coz I mentioned my name in this arti.)

OUT OF INSPIRATION FOR DIS FOLKS, SO KEEP KEWL , BYE!!

D.C again, well Iso is out to play some Streetfighter II on the SNES,
there's a competition goin' on , and it's on a large screen!!
Everybody at the party seems to be rather tired, I don't understand
coz my mind is as clear as a bottle of vodka.
djeez, there are all kindz  of music playing , some break-beat housz and 
ofcourse the optional modules and chiptunes. I'm outta inspiration.
the rest of dis (p)article is  for zom oder dude......

17:28

Yo, this is O.T.M. again, we (Wingleader Slimer Bonus, and ofcourse me)
us went into town. We got us some survival-packs at the local store, and
used some food at the local Mc Donalds. My God, what an experience, I hope
I can live through today, the only two things Wingleader and Slimer can
think of are sex, and sex. In the car they told each other their own
expirience with children, cars, parents, etc. etc. etc. etc etc.
Well maybe tonight they can learn from each other. (Wingleader hasn't
got any sleeping-bag, and Slimer has room for two so who knows........)
But now for the reason why I write this crap: Slimer is to busy 
playing Street Fighter on the SNES, and Wingleader is busy with lotsa
things with lotsa other guys (Zo dubbelzinnig genoeg Wingie).
I just saw that the article is doing well, but there is still more to
come, more to expirience (And that's what I'm afraid of.)

I'll try to keep you listed!!!!  (O.T.M.)

17:48

Hereeeee's Slimer, what's this craptalk about my person in this realtime
article !!?
Anyway you can sleep with me, O.T.M. in my little tight sleepingbaggy,  man
we will have lotsa fun.........
Well, time to do some other stuff instead of typing all day and all night !

17:53

Hiya, Chromie typing away again. I'm still hapyy I came to this party. They
only problem I'm quite homesick. I wanna sleep in a real bed, MY OWN BED. Not
on a sticky "matje" on the floor. Wingleader brought a pillow with him! The
bastard, I'm sleeping on my rolled up jeans and he's got a fucking pillow!
WAAAAAH!!?! Well inspiration is quite wanted now as I don't know anything
else to annoy you with ... CU!

GVD !!!

 ^
 |
This was typed by LOWLIFE after he's been beaten up my me Slimer in a
friendly game of Streetfighter !


Yeah well, Streetfighter CHAMPIONSHIP Edition !!! That means VEGA vs RYU !
Goddamne. Well that's no real competition !!! F*CK !!

18:09 or something

Hi, D.C again I also entered the compie and I played against martin and I
won HaHaHa.
He actually asked me if we could repeat the game outside , in realtime, true 
color with scaling, rotating and tridi-sound!!!
Well we didn't but I would've won anyway (I hope!!)
C ya!!

18:15

Yeah, that was fun! *NOT* Hi, DrB from Synth Dream/Galtan Six is typing
this sh*t. Oh man, I was completely beaten up by that scumbag called
Jeroen(?). Me, that little fragile boy claiming victory was chopped into
tiny chucks of absolute nothingness. Massacred into small fragments would
suit better I think. Anyway, I will join the heat again, to blow away any
mr. whatever and call myself, eh, well, you know what I mean.. See ya folks!


18:17

Yoo, T.H.U. typing right away.
First I tought StreetFighter was a lame game,after winning the game
a few times I think it's even worser.
SAGAT rules!!!!!


18:24 Wingleader, is also over here to set some things right, firstly my
      mind is not filled with sex,sex, and sex. (But what should you think
      of when you are only surrounded with guys). The rest of Synergy is 
      working their buts out of their pants to get the MEGADEMO ready and 
      let us pray that it will be ready tomorrow. And now for the basterd
      who call's himself O.T.M.(Oude Tering Mijt), he is just an oversexed
      youngster that hasn't got any rights of speaking so Shut Up.
      Bye for now,
      Wingleader/Synergy


18:30

This O.T.M. again, but I ask myself what has everybody against my pseudo.
Well as far as I am concerned Fuck You!!! (Esp. Wingleader with his crappy
English...)

O.T.M. of the D.B.A

18:41   I've got just one question, can anybody tell me who are in D.B.A.,
        as for me, the only active member is Bonus, he is the coder,painter,
        organiser and the rest of D.B.A. . (I can feel the breath of some 
        other members in my neck, because they know i'm speaking the truth
        and you know the truth hurts.
        Wingleader/Synergy

18:49   Hi, this is Drb again, trapped behind the screen, doomed to type
        some nonsense due to the lack of something more interesting
        activities. Just a quick note dedicated to Wingleader and O.T.M :
        He guys, stop fighting will ya ? I will put both of you into a
        ramshackle cottage with walls of roughcut stoneblocks if you
        don't listen. Then your bodies will turn white and you're
        death meat. Fair doos ?

18:53

        Slimer: NO Comment..........


18:56
        
        Wingleader is now sliming with O.T.M. and they seemed to have
        stopped fighting !

19:01   Okidoki then. Hey guys, where's my hamburger I've ordered an 
        hour ago ? Coming ? Oh right, lucky you, I was just planning
        to turn you into a frog. Quaaak! :-)

19:10

F*CK!!! Me,T.H.U. that is,has lost from that f*cking Zanac.
Hmppff!!! I'll never fight again with that muthaf*ckin' game.

19:11

Okidoki pojo's, it's me again on the keys (awgrhghh that sounds 
lame=> fits nicely in this mag). I'm still bored although I've 
just played Streetfighter II for half an hour (much too long..). 
Nothing has changed in here, just that the music that is playing 
has improved with an factor of 30005089678 (okey I was
exaggerating a bit at that item. To be precise it was 30005089677.
Do you kare? Me not.) And with this craptalk which isn't of any 
use, interest or importance to you, I will now venture into more 
important things like drinking my beer or letting that lamer of a
D.C. type some wordzz.....

19:20

Yo D.C laming away on this piece of plastix. (there sure are more pieces on 
this keyboard than Havoc ass-umes, more than 1 piece at least , so it surely 
is plastix instead of plastic.) havoc wants to write his reply:
You lamer of an D.C., your first sentence should have been:
Yo D.C laming away on these pieces of plastic.
Or:
Yo D.C laming away on these pieces of plastix
(if multiple types of plastic would have been used in this keyboard)
D.C's reply: ookeeej, I stand corrected iI should have written....
Hello dear sirs, this is your servant D.C typing a piece of un-interesting 
text for you. (sorry 'bout that,Havoc just had to be the one to correct me,
so these were the consequences for you guys!!)
As I explained earlier 'my dear friend' Havoc is sitting here also, and at
every spelling mistake I make he is jerking my head of putting it in
his mouth chewing it up and then swallow it 'till it has been consumed and 
then exited his body through his shithole. After  this has happened and the 
contents of his bowels have been emptied on the floor, there slowly grows a 
new D.C out of it which can type  on 'till  it makes another spelling mistake
 ,then the whole fuckin' story (NO censorship here!!) repeats itself!!
well D.C quits now so Havoc can type his reply>>>>>
D.C, thou little unsignificant piece of spermey pisshole, thou shall not live 
to see the light of day, after being tortured by Beelzebub and His Fallen
Angels. After ye has been processed to dog-food, thou shall be used to feed
the Sentry Dogs of Hell.
D.C's puny reply:Haaahaaa stupid Havoc just had a milkshake all over his 
face he is now really pissed and is just trying to make up excuses for his own
mistake. Oh well, poor Havoc, his milkshake from McDonalds didn't have a straw
so he tried to drink normally, it didn't work. Ah well, he said I had to reply
Thou english is as poor as thou forefathers-neighboors golfish.(Geddit)
And now .....  for something completely different, you lazy grafix-artist(?)
I have to tell you about your pretty buurman (O.T.M. is now being slaughtered
by slimer,Havoc and O.T.M want to take Slimer from behind)
O my God, what are they doing, Havoc's little weener is being eaten, Oh, I
see it's a frikandel,pheew I was wrong...
Everybody is now becoming a little more enthusiastic about things!!!
What are things you might ask, well Havoc hasn't got any!!!
ohoh, he is standing behind me and leaning over my shoulder while reading this
HI HAVOC!!! WE LOVE YOU!!! (Bleeuurgh!!) He uuuh, just kidding, I'm turning 
purple !!! REply:::After reading D.C's pathetic reply, I don't think you'll
need ANY reply at all... But as D.C is such a malfunctioning little baby, I 
will reply for his eyes only (or for yours if you are just as stupid as he is,
although I most strongly doubt that...)AAAAAAAAHHRHH (THAT WAS D.C STrangling
me.. But here's the reply: Although I don't remember where this increasingly
uninteresting discussion is all about, I must say that D.C is utterly wrong 
in every aspect of life, the universe and everything!
Now some important persons will type some things, according to Slijmbal.
He Slijmbal, wie op deze party zijn er dan belangrijk behalve ik?

20:07

Shiiiiiit!!!! what a f*ckin' music out there!!!
Next time i'll bring some real hardcore hip-hop with me.
And for the lovers of BASS music some 5Hz drops (Techmaster PEB and other).
T.H.U. outta here!!!! See ya.

20:18 

Okee, ik ga al weg.

20:19

Slimer, hou je kop toch eens, hebben we eindelijk iemand die wat gaat 
schrijven, stuur je hem weer weg!!!!.

20:20

Slimer, sukkel, nou had je iemand die wat wou schrijven, is 'ie het vergeten!!
(wat 'ie wou schrijven, kip!)

20:23

The Joker zuipt Bier met papier snippers , ik vraag me af hoe dat smaakt 
heeft ie in ieder geval iet om op te happen . Smakelijk Dirk

Zx en Co , heeft het record Joints draaien nog niet verbeterd , zal wel lukken
voordat de party afgelopen is .
