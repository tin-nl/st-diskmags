Well let's congratulate Havoc on HIS birthday: happy birthday PETEL!!

Ok time for a realtime BEDTIME story

Once upon a time there was a little man called pinkeltje (also known as 
slijmbal), for a little man he was rather large,but he couldn't help it
he was a member of the P.B.A  (Pinkeltje Busters Association).
When pinkeltje was little ,a BABY, he was born. After this sad fact had
taken place, his mother and father celebrated for three days. They celebrated
because there was food again, you see pinkeltje was born in Outer-West-East-
South-North Africa somwhere in America. (the Quickie-motel to be exact)
And ofcourse his parents were Cannibals!!, so they thought 'hmm, foood!!'.
but pinkeltje was a very smart large little-man, when he was being cooked in  
the micro-wave oven ,yes cannibals have a civilisation too, he opened the door
and when the bell rang, his parents tried to get their 'THUISMENU' but 
pinkeltje had flown. Pinkeltje was now very sad and he travelled the world for
many many minutes until he came upon a man who was a little giant, his name 
was paulus the Forest-dealer, who had just signed a contract with the DEA 
for a delivery of ten k's of coke (the cola that is) not realising that he was
being ripped off coz coke comes in  litres not in kilos.. So, when pinkeltje
met paulus ,paulus was very sad. pinkeltje asked:' why are you sad?'
Paulus answered:'My mothers nephew has eaten the goldfishes' droppings which 
were produced by our cat!!'
'What!?!',said pinkeltje.
'I love you ' answered Paulus, pinkeltje realized that he was falling in love
then just when he wanted to kiss paulus , paulus pulled off his toupet and 
revealed that he really was a baldheaded little female elf that was lost in 
the woods. Pinkeltje was very glad that paula pulled of her mask in time coz 
he wasn't into elves (geddit?) , but that would soon change.....
yes Paula was actually a very intelligent big girl, but if she would've 
bonked pinkeltje he would have been squashed under her heavy body. but becoz
she was hot as hell pinkeltje decided to be inventive for a change, he climbed
up a tree, and he boffed her doggy-style,while she was barking away, 
pinkeltje noticed that one of his organs was reaching into the heavens, yes 
it was dripping too, you might have thought that it was nice but it wasn't 
becoz the drippings from his nose were fauling up his clothes, anyway he came
and when paula was still having fun, pinkeltje decided to entertain himself 
with a game of STREETFIGHTER II on his portable Super Lonertendi Antorainment
sickstem Holographer  (also known as SLASH) then he left paula alone and went
into the bushes again, here he encountered E.T ,the extra-testicle, and he 
felt very happy, coz he was so small he could see the hairy part and didn't
have to smell the cheesy part(?) they had a nice little conversation together
and decided that they wanted to rule the world, they would call it 'the fourth
reichdom' and they were going to invade Belgium, but as they knew this country
had only one resource patatochips they decided to just undress themselves en 
show their genitals to paula who had just arrived from her little private 
party. After fucking wildly for about half an hour, and pinkeltje noticed that
his dick was almost exploding becoz of the air-compressor he had connected to 
his ass, which was connected to his dick (logical, eh?). The compressor had
it's mains supply provided by an aggegrat (8.9 liter General Motors diesel
from the fifties). Then pinkeltje fucked off (literally) and went into the 
mountains. There he met(worst) a giant neemt "Daffy Fuck". Daffy said "
begorrah humbug my dick is bigger than yours fiuthy". Pinkeltje had to laugh 
at this remark, not only biekos his dik was the fattest ever, but mainly becoz
he had taken Ariel Ultra met extra krimpmiddel along. He said to the giant:
"Sjoo mie joor dik!". The giant happily opened his fly and out jumped his 
bumping cock. It said : "Fuck you, I will start my own story.". This was
the prologue of the famous book by Havoc an W.C called:

ever after........

this sexist story was originally intended as a really fun bedtime story
but Havoc insisted on the pornografic-bits so i apologize for zat.

Okay, now it's about 6:28 and dawn is beginning, the sounds of Alice in 
Chains are chiming in my ears, my mouth is dry and has a slick tast of 
old oatmeal,my head is clear and I can hear that many people are waking up, 
but as i'm not yet able to hear the lovely birdies twatter as everybody
isn't able to produce an effective piece of code, or anything else for that 
matter, what in gods name have we been doing in this text?, well we have
been invited into the nutty brains of some very cool people, we travelled from
plastix to traductions of dutch slang words, from slagging of kornelis bv to
 a pornografic version of pinkeltje. As for the productive side of this party
synergy wants to finish their demo today, and that is all that is happening 
right now, well people are still very enthusiastic about the snes though, it
does seem to be increasingly popular over  the Sega Megadrive, as for my own 
personal opinion i don't realy car on which machine I play my games as long 
as the graphics are crisp and clear, the scrolling is reasonable,the idea is
kinda original and when it's hugely addictive.... the whole game just has to
polished and have a smooth feeling to it, now i must admit that the snes has
much better graphical capabilities and audio capabilities, but then the sega
megadrive was here first, so it's an older machine... well i'm going to sit 
somewhere comfartable now coz my back is aching bye  C  U  L-8-TER ,  D.C


6:52 AM.

Early, very early. Rapido wanted to use his sleeping bag so I had to leave,
still a bit sleepy (a very bit, even). Still coding on Crapman, the game
for real losers... eh heroes that is, got to do 7 of the 10 little movies
that you can see between levels. Sleeping is somewhat of a problem here,
but for the rest it's lotsa fun. Loud music, many people and enough
computers to fill a room twice the size of the building we're currently
residing in. The chairs are shit because they give your back an awful
strain. No more to say at the moment. Bye.

Mysteria. (Who after reading some of the preceding text, thinks that some
of its writers are, to say the least, silly).

7:18 AM \/

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

        ^____ Donation of Aardschock ( Little sleep for everyone... )

7:26 
Hi D.C here just to have something to do until the game is being downloaded
i'm loading axelay at the moment and it's taking fucking long , a well at 
least there is some nice musix playing in the background (agressions' 
braindamage) bye it's loaded

9:15 

As there doesn't seem to be any animo (again!) to  type sonme text I
guess it's up to me to write you another piece of crap here so, if at first
I don't succeed...... maybe later , well here is a little list of people 
actually awake at the moment: D.C, Zanac, Mysteria, Zx, Fox, Zigi, Mc, 
Penguin and that's all folks, well those other sleepy heads can't help it
i've been trying to catch some z's but for some funny reason I seem not to 
be able to do so, so just to type anything I will continue to try and write 
for you part two of Pinkeltje (non-porn version 1.01 (c) '93 D.C)


            The Return of Pinkeltje - Exploding Mushrooms!

                        Chapter one -    Intro


After his long marriage with Paula (formerly known as Paulus the 
forrest-dealer) Pinkeltje wakes up one day and realises, this is not 
what he wants in his life, he wants to have adventures and be active for a 
while before he settles down and lead a homely life. So without any warning to
Paula he packs his bags and goes to Super Mario-World.........
Arriving at Nintendo Airport he's picked up by a rather suspicious looking
character, yes its a koopa troopa, king koopa had heard of pinkeltjes arrival
and did not like little pinkeltje and his P.B.A. to mess in his affairs.
So the koopa troopa takes pinkeltje to king koopa. when they arrive the first 
thing pinkeltje notices is the bad breath that king koopa has, the odor of 
garlic combined with beer and onions really gave pinkeltje a shock, he didn't
know it was possible for a man, or for any other living or synthetic entity
to reak so bad.But luckily pinkeltje had some nose-clippers in his bag, in the
past he had needed them for the food that paula made, but they came in handy 
right now. 'So', began king koopa,'what are you doing in my world?'
'I'm trying to lead an adventurous and full life'pinkeltje replied
'But why come to Koopa's world-o-wonders?' asked koopa.
'well , actually I wanted to go to thailand to get myself a new pair of wifes
but as the plane tickets were a teensy weensy bit too expensive for a little 
goblin like me, I tried the cheapest holiday-resort!!'
'Cheapest?!?! Why you little f#*ng a^*$hole!! I'll kill you now!!'
and koopa grabbed his verty very very big ACME munchkin-murderer and try to 
suck in our hero, but pinkeltje reacted very quickly and grabbed anti-ACME 
munckin-murderer device and activated it..... Then koopa's machine started to
react very strange, the effect of pinkeltje 's machine was that the self-
destruct mechanism was activated inside koopa's machine.... But as it was an 
ACME-product it contained a smallatom-bomb (made in taiwan ofcourse)
and just as it was to explode, pinkeltje reached for the button on his uniform
and said:" Beam me up,Scotty!!"        BOOOOOOOOOOOAOAOAOOAAOAAAAMM   deng
plof knal sttsts BOOOM  BO.oo.o.o.mm.  
                             --- to be continued ---
09:50

Oh noo! I am mortal I am going to die, I have slept for at least four 
hours, and wasn't it me (O.T.M.) that sleep is for the mortal???
Well  I have to go to the docter anyway (I think I am radio-active after
eating at that shitty Mc Donalds) so I could ask him. But than again, 
I wouldn't be the only crew-member which is mortal, the rest of the
crew (D.B.A.) are still sleeping 

But now for some facts Eagle of Sentry counted the machines over here, and
calculated the rates of the computers/consoles compared to each other

10:26   I'm awake isn't that something special, but who i'm I, you don't 
        know and you don't care. And now something about the sleeping 
        facilities, they are shit, shit and more shit, I just slept for 
        half an hour and than somebody woke me up to say, you must leave
        here because we need the mats you are sleeping on, so I got away
        and left to the other room, but what is that, that room is already
        filled with people and they are snooring and making other noises,  so
        what i'm I doing here, i'm getting up again and walking to this 
        machine and typing this text.

it's zigi again...well,my life has lost its interest:ZX beated me 10
in a row while we're playing Mortal Combat...can you imagine it???
Anyway ,I'm really tired because I didn't sleep this night.That's the
reason of all my losses...just joking because ZX is a good player
(he won yesterday the snes competition: Street Fighter 2
I have to leave the keys now because it's lunch time!!! Bye.... 



11:55

I just finished my lunch and I'm back on the keyboard to tell you how
it is possible to have an as good player as ZX...in fact it is very
simple to understand:when he has got a few minutes left , he plays with 
his snes.For example,during the time I wrote you (11:30) and now(12:00),
he still playing.Hold on,I'll check if he's playing at the moment...for 
sure he is...well I don't care anymore about my very poor results
against him...hhaaaaaa ZX,you will always surprise me...zigi signing off
for the last time because I leave the party place in a while...C U

12:34

                            PINKELTJE MUST DIE 
            - Part III 1/2 : The Revenge of the Boskabouter -

After Pinkeltje's excellent adventure in Marioland (which was quite boring
by the way) we will now continue with the Revenge of the Boskabouter. But, 
thou might ask, who or what the fuckin' hell is the Boskabouter? Well, 
translated the Boskabouter means Forestdwarve, but that misses the point 
quite badly. Something like Forest Pee Wee Herman is probably more 
appropriate. Let's change that (just for the ease of typing) into BKFPWH
(BosKabouterForestPeeWeeHerman). Well, BKFPWH was walking in the forest
of Marioland when all of a sudden Clint Eastwood was walking into his viewing
angle. Clint said: "What about showing eachother our guns?". BKFPWH happily
shouted:"Yes! I would like that, titter-ye-not!!!!". Clint said: "OK, get 
ready, here's the cuntdown, 4...... 3...... 2...... 6...... 2,76^4*9......
0..... -156456,76%..... GO!!!!". While BKFPWH was still unzipping his pants
to grab his big male gun, Clint grabbed his .44 Magnum and shot down BKFPWH.
Blood was flooding'n'flying in all available directions, all directions were
made available by parallax hardware scrolling of all the 33.7 bitplanes 
available at that time. Suddenly, Blanka came running out of some bushes 
started to piss on BKFPWH's corpse. Clint said to Blanka : "Hoi!" and used his
.44 to shoot him down. Blanka's last words were "Alweer de melk vergeten!".
But BKFPWH wasn't really dead. He had been chosen to be the prime Fallen
Angel. But first, he had to be educated in evilness... Read more later!
