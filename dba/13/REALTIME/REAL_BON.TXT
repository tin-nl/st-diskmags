Well I won't make such an long article as Slimer and OTM did because I 
have to do to much else for the magazine. 

At first I thought, at the first good look at the building, what is 
this. But after we entered I knew we were at the right address. It 
wasn't to big, but big enough to hold a very nice party with lot's of 
nice people/groups. The food was good, the beer was cold, the movie's 
strange and good so what more could you ask for ???. I just want to 
thank Sentry (esp. Eagle) for a great time, very good service, and 
hope you will organize such a party again soon. Thanks go also to 
LowLife and Gerrit (I believe that was his name) for the service at 
the bar.

Other thanks go to:

Chrome     : for the strange movie collection he brought with him.
Wingleader : for the software and the fun.
Mandrome   : for the extra dent in the door of my car.
M.C. of A.M: for the sidvoice.

and just everybody else who joined the party to make it one hell of a 
time. Hope to see you all at another party real soon...
