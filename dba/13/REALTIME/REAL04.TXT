First we start with a list of people/groups who where on the party.
The names are not in alfabetic order because the list of names on my paper
is a bit confusing to read from.

                  Scavenger and Zanac )

D.B.A.          ( Bonus, O.T.M. and Slimer )
Hotline         ( Lowlife and Sledge )

The Joker

There where some other guys too, but i we have no names of them on the paper
list( someone of M.C.A., Stephan Posthuma and others ).
It could also be that some of the names are wrong ( hey i'm not perfect )!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12:54

This is Ultimate again typing crap...   I have noticed one thing on this party
and that is that nobody listens to the anouncements. exp: 23:00 movie. noone
shows up so that the movie wont start before 01:15..... At 13:00 everybody
should be outside for photo's, but i don't see anyone going out....  it's now
12:56... we wait for the first guy to go out....  12:57 Still waiting... 
12:58 the organistion is now shouting to go out, 12:59 yes, we are going out
this is history!!! we are listining to orders.......   13:00 half of the guys
are still inside...    I'm going out so.....


13:10

My name is Monique, and my eye's color is Blue... I have some long blond 
hair, 1m60, 96 Kg....  Sometime i want to drink a glass of water, sometime

13:16

party? I hope i'll never meet you again...bye
By the way, ZX became totaly crazy:he's now listening to photo-camera
(does he stop playing games all day long???)
  
13:25
This is O.T.M. again, all the group-photo's have just been taken, and that
was a big mess, just like this party, loud music, many people talking 
and shouting, not much sleep some people are getting on other peoples
nerves (esp. me) but who cares, as long as we have fun!!!!
De Balle!!!

13:45
Oh no Bonus is going to attempt to play along a very dangerous physical
game involving lotsa bottles and head-banging, Oh no Bonus look out
oh no a blow on the head Jesus Christ blood all over the place, and 
Bonus totally knocked out....Is this the end of the D.B.A.
Read more later.
Slimer zal ik jou dan maar naar huis toe rijden, die Wingleader
dumpen we onderweg wel. #

13:48

Yep that's fine with me( answer to the dutch sentence that you foreign
readers can't read ) !
But maybe we can bring Bonus back to life again, lets ask the one !

THE ANSWER = NO !!! ( Big loud voice coming from the controlroom in this
                     kraakpand (buy a dictionary for translation ))

DUCK.........( a bottle with coke comes flying by ).....

The bottle smashes onto the wall,( But the bottle of coke didn't
contain coke but Kaliumnitraat) Oh no Slimer don't piss on it you
blow us all into 

BBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!

And al that was left was darkness.

14:15

Jeeeezzuuus!!!! What is happening to me,It's almost like having a mental
hangover.
I hate that fucking speed shit (hardrock that is..)
CIA has arrived at 13:45,I told him about the movie "Necromantic".
It's the worst movie I had ever seen but it's fun to watch.

 
15:32 The last words have been spoken, we are getting out of here.
