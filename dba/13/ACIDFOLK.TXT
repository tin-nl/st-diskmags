SOME ACID STUFF REVIEWED
------------------------

Oh God... I'm behind my computer, wearing my winter jacket and an original 
Russian army mink cap because it's so f*cking cold in here. Some of you 
might ask themselves why my computer is outside, but the problem is that it 
isn't outside at all. Our central heating system collapsed just a few hours 
ago, and almost all of the house is f*cking cold by now. We've got the 
electrical heater in the living room (doesn't help much, unfortunately) and 
we've only got one, so I'll have to warm myself until tomorrow. Enough of 
this sorrow talk, let's go on with the review...


ACID FOLK (Perplexer)
==============================================================================
Perplexer is a relatively new team on the club scene, but as they release 
under the Urban label (which also does Westbam and Marusha), this single CD 
seemed to be worth it's 15 guilders. The three tracks are in the usual two 
mixes plus one new track form. Usually the new track is crap, but this time 
it's the best one on the CD. 'Vary Speed', as it's called,  starts off slow 
with a nice TB-303 acid sound, then breaks hard into a very clear drum 
section (with the acid still going on, and getting faster), with a 
breakdrum and hard bassline (just the way I like it). It's one of the very 
few non-breakbeat acid tracks which doesn't get boring soon. The other two 
tracks (both mixes of 'Acid Folk') are not as similar as one might suspect, 
and the 'Dudelsack' certainly is a nice twist. Acid Folk (Vocals) is the 
first and the one most likely to be heard in clubs. It's a lot like the 
other stuff produced in Germany nowadays (Trance Renaissance, Westbam? 
;->), being fairly speedy and having a normal straight beat. But as I said 
the dudelsack makes it refreshing. Track two (Acid Folk (Low Speed)) is a 
slow version of the first track, without the (stupid) vocals. The Acid is 
used very well to get that endless rave feeling on the dancefloor. The one 
time I heard it in the disco (about a week ago now) it really made go on 
for another half hour, although being quite drunk at the time.

BAM BAM BAM (Westbam)
==============================================================================
Westbam... Well, what's left to say about him? Probably the most commercial 
ex-underground deejay of our millennium and playing at the most overrated 
event in Western Europe (MAYDAY, die Deutscher glauben wirklich das sie den 
elektronischen Musik selbst populaer gemacht haben, aber vergessen das nur 
Kraftwerk in diesem Respekt ein wichtige Rolle gespielt hat fuer Deutschland 
in dem letztem zwanzig jahr), but still his 'Trance' is easily accessible and 
very popular among a lot of people. 'BAM^3' is presented very well, the box 
is clear about what's inside, but the back side is probably copied straight 
away from the 12" set (or is this a pathetic try to be 'cool'?). I will now 
try to give a brief description of each track separately, while listening to 
it.

ACID SAUSAGE FROM SALZBURGO
The intro, with cars driving from the left of my head to the right and back. 
Someone flicking his keys, and then opening his car. A senseless intro, but 
well done.                                                       Rating: 60%

WIZARDS OF THE SONIC
The first track, probably known to most of the people who attend discos once 
in a while. Good intro, followed by a strong build-up into the main theme. 
The main theme is changing a bit from time to time, and there are breaks for 
the tired feet on the dancefloor. Personally I would have placed this track 
at the end of the CD, because of the feeling it evokes (een goeie 
uitsmijter!).                                                    Rating: 91%

CELEBRATION GENERATION
The track that made Westbam famous (at least, in the Netherlands!). At the 
time, it was quite original, mixing a lot of different samples into the same 
sound. Somewhat less good intro, but the rest of the track is done very well. 
I really like the timing of the breaks in this one.              Rating: 94%
(Ik ga nou effe patat eten!)

RAVING SOCIETY
A slow start, then a break into fast drums. Then a buildup to the main theme, 
with repeating of the fast drums. A new buildup. Quite a boring track, 
although it would merge nicely with a rainy afternoon.           Rating: 60%

STRICTLY BAM
A good start, I really like the drum merge-in. Even some industrial samples 
if you listen really well. A slow tune.                          Rating: 70%

CLUB CANOSSA
Strong start, with sirens, and piano, and the drum gets in at just the right 
time. Speeds up really well, with some vocal samples I really can't define. 
Has that very good speed feeling, mainly because of the slow breaks, after 
which the drum section makes the break effective.                Rating: 83%

ESCAPIST
Vinyl-flutter at the beginning, gives me a Christmas-feeling. Then a break 
into fast drums, and some synth sounds (a bit industrial alike). On the 
whole, a relaxing track which makes me feel sad.                 Rating: 82%

TRACK
Short samples at the beginning, then a piano-synth. Really restless upto now. 
Very clear, clean sound. Quite fast in fact. The synth piano is used well, 
and is being merged into (and with) acid quite well.             Rating: 77%

BAM BAM BAM
One of my favourites. Well matched vocals (guess the text!), with good 
background. Then a hard beat, followed up by some flowing sound. This is 
really like opening a fresh can of Grolsch beer to me (just the feeling!). 
There also is some bitch shouting around (probably just got something stuck 
into her ***).                                                   Rating: 88%

AFTER HOURS
Boring and stupid kid's voice sample, with the usual samples and synth sounds 
around, and a piano ofcourse. A diskfiller in its best form.     Rating: 55%
