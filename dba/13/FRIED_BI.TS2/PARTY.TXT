BREMEN TRIP

                    ***** A TRIP TO BREMEN PART II ***** 
                (or : how silly dutch guys can be in public)  
 
Today is the 8th of April 1994. Although it has already been four days, I 
can still remember clearly what fantastic experience we all had. But I will 
not bore you with the memories of a partydude, no, I will try to give an 
exact report on what made it so good. So here it comes: 
 
Thursday, 31st of March. 
------------------------
 
After weeks of planning, today it should finally happen. Before packing my 
stuff and the other necessities, I went to school. It was boring as usual, 
the only thing nearly bearable was the History class. After my boring hours 
were over for that day, I went to the local supermarket in order to buy 
some stuff I can't do without. I ran through the granny-filled butcher 
department, skipped the singing cheeseman, mashed a few children near the 
candybars and took a dive into the alcoholics. There it was, Martini 
Bianco. And Jamaican Rum. I got mad when I noticed that the Grolsch beer 
was all bought by some 'Diemse messentrekkers', they only had low-alcohol 
Grolsch left. Because it is not my custom to drink piss, I ventured on to 
the magazines. Thank God, the Voetbal International was still on sale. I 
grabbed one, saw it had some stains on it, threw it between the bananas, 
grabbed another one and dropped it into my shoppingbag. A lady from the 
shop asked me if I would care to clean up the mess at the bananas. I 
replied that I would clean it at St. Juttemis day, leaving her looking 
dumb. I loaded my bag with saucage, leverworst, crisps, peanuts, M&M's, 
mandarins and a fresh pair of bathing slippers. (Well, in fact I didn't buy 
those, but it seemed to give a nice break in the sentence to let you think 
about). At the point-of-sale I asked the bitch (about 1.75m, blond, cup B, 
too much make-up, cheap clothes and probably waiting for a carpenter to 
marry with) for a bag of Drum halfzwaar shag (dubbel vloei, ofcourse!), 2 
packs of Marlboro and two lighters. Unfortunately, they hadn't had any 
Marlboro for two days, so I decided to skip the lighters too. I could use 
my Zippo instead, anyway. Because of an error in the system, the bitch had 
to type in all prices. She did wrongly. For well over 40 guilders of my 
shopping, she charged me with 15 guilders and 35 cents. I didn't feel like 
complaining. So far for my shopping adventures. 
 
Later that day, I was happily pixellizing on my Falcon, when my mother 
called me for some of her shitty food. It was the puke-evoking stuff from 
Brussels again. I hate that stuff. It makes you smell like you've just 
swallowed an thoroughly rotten sewerrat, you get to farting quite soon and 
it stays that way for at least two days. After this nice meal, we went for 
the trainstop in Didam, where Mantra/Dawn was to arrive. From the first 
minute we saw eachother on, we started bullshitting, making jokes, planning 
great stuff and being noisy in general. That night, we watched several 
Falcon and ST demo's (like, for instance, Froggies, Black & White, Warum 
and the one from The Hague), not knowing what excellence we would see the 
forthcoming weekend. At around 1 am, we decided to go into mute mode. 
 
 
Friday, 1st of April. 
--------------------- 
In the early morning, Fox and Goof arrived at my place. Goof made me 
phoning around for some cross-assemblers, which he needed badly (ze komen 
d'r aan, Arco!). In the mean time, I had to pack my Falcon, 1040, 
amplifier, tapedeck, sleepingbag, alcoholics, food, coke, discs, nicotine 
sticks, nicotine weeds, mags, spacebed, surfingboard (not really), clothes, 
and some more shit into a few large bags supplied by my birthgiver. At 
about eleven o'clock, the spacewagon arrived to pick our stuff up. We 
mashed all the stuff into it as fast as we could, raced to the freeway, and 
found out that there was a nice large traffic jam in front of the 
Rijnbridge near Arnhem (THE city!). After about half an hour waiting for 
the traffic jam to evaporate, we succeeded to pass the bridge. We chose the 
road heading towards Deventer, then drove through Twente, and made little 
stop at Denekamp, near the border. Mantra and I went into the supermarket, 
and bought some more first necessities: crisps, chocolate, coke, assorted 
licorice, and, more important than anything else in the world, a set of 
PEZ-dispensers and a few refillments. Then we started our journey through 
Moffrica (also known as Germany). Frequently stopping to wave our 
PEZ-dispensers at Goof and Fox, Mantra and I talked all the way. Before I 
noticed, we already approached Bremen. Never knew two hours could pass that 
fast. We found the partyplace quite easily, unlike last year, when we 
searched for about an hour. We unpacked all the shit, paid the entrance 
fee, brought our stuff upstairs to the Dutchy Department, and waved my Dad 
goodbye. Then we started to unpack the computers. Before long, the room was 
a total mess, as far as it wasn't already. When my Falcon was up and 
running, I decided to have a smoke and a beer. I started looking around me 
to find out who was there. Sentry had arrived already, well, at least, I 
smelled a strange mix of shag, beer and saucage. Synergy was there, 
obviously, because of their microwave. I noticed Slimer of DBA, and as 
usual, he was depressed. The TOSsies were out there somewhere. Where were 
the International dudes? This party could have been organised in Holland, 
as far as I could see. It was only later that I found out about the doors 
leading to the German part of the party. Before that, I made sure I had a 
good place to sleep (near the window!). I briefly checked all my contacts 
(Head connected? Yes... Brain operational? Voltage low... Legs still there? 
Yes... Mouth functional? Spastic movements alarm!). Just as usual. In a few 
hours time, it was starting to be a real Dutch-style party (beer, music, 
smoke, beer, liquours, beer, Falcons, more beer, carpet soccer, pixellizing 
(not much), beer... well, I guess you can imagine what I mean...). It was 
then that I discovered where the Germans were. How boring can a cool party 
get! All the German dudes were coding, pixellizing or making music (with 
their headphones on!!!). No offense meant, but isn't a party supposed to be 
a place where one is ought to have lots of fun? At least I think so! At 
about eight o'clock, Mantra and I went out to the McDonald's. During the 
walk we consumed about half a pack of shag. At the Mac's, after harrassing 
the waitresses, we were sipping at our shakes, when all of a sudden a few 
German guys from the party came inside. The six or seven of them were more 
quiet than Mantra and me alone. Then we went back to the partyplace, but 
not before stopping at a gasstation. We bought half of their stock of FAXE 
beer, and another pack of Marlboro. The bitch at the cashdrawer looked 
silly at us when we didn't want to pay for any of the gaspumps. I couldn't 
figure why, until we left the shop. It was just then that I saw the shop's 
location. We had unknowingly crossed some kind of a highway. Back at the 
party, all the Dutch guys went downstairs to see Ren & Stimpie on video. I 
took along some beers and went down to see what was coming up. The video 
took three hours of my time, but I didn't notice it passing. At the end, 
only me, Butthead and Beavis were left. Ren & Stimpie are coooool!!! 
Somewhat deeper in the night, I decided to make myself some nasi goreng. At 
4 o'clock, I decided to go to sleep. On entering the sleepingroom, I 
smelled the worst farts I have ever smelled in my life. Thanks to Rapido 
and BAT I found a reasonable place to sleep, far away from the rest of the 
Dutch stinkers. 
 
 
Saturday, 2nd of April. 
----------------------- 
Early in the morning, I woke up. Too early for my taste, anyhow (11:00). We 
had to go to the supermarket for some more food. It was really a mess, 
imagine 20 fullgrown Dutch guys running through a supermarket, jumping into 
shoppingtrollies, calling havoc upon the beer department, picking stuff 
from other people's trollies and shouting their lungs out. You could also 
see this as a part of the Wiedergutmachung. At least I did. Our trolley was 
filled with beer, blue curacao, Marlboro, saucage, instant meals, coke, 
7up, for 'iengesamt siebenunfuunfziek mark fuunfoendsexig!'. Back at the 
partybuilding, some german bonehead asked me to return the trolley to the 
supermarket. No way, Jose. I pretended not to understand him and went away. 
During the day, we started work on a Falcon demo. It will be a cooperation 
between Mega 4, Dawn, Sentry and the Giants, if ever finished. Some of the 
guys had lots of fun with an inflatable doll called 'Maria', especially 
Bonus and Wingleader. Maybe this was a way for them to loose (a part of) 
their life-long frustration. Later in the evening, we went over to the Mac 
for a quick bite. Fox got us all smashed in the back of his car, and almost 
killed us by passing the 'Lada-bocht' at about 70 mph. I was lucky enough 
to sit in front of the rest. It was a quiet evening, anyhow. Not so much 
happening, except for the Pinkeltje stories which you can read in the Party 
Article. 
 
 
Sunday, 3rd and Monday, 4th of April. 
------------------------------------- 
Aw god! I woke up with a headache as immense as my bank account (in other 
words: there was a slight buzz tone for about six seconds, then silence). I 
put on my bathing slippers (not really) and went upstairs to get some fresh 
clothes. As I walked through the 'Buergerhaus', I noticed some Germans 
watching the Ren & Stimpie video. On the first floor, everybody was already 
moving around doing nothing. I grabbed my clothes, went downstairs and got 
dressed. As I was reapproaching the partyplace, I saw Maria lying in a 
corner. I decided to leave her there. Within ten minutes, I had eaten my 
breakfast, smoked two cigarettes and drunk my first can of beer of that 
day. There were many more to come. Powa and Butthead decided that the demo 
wouldn't be released at the party, and Powa started working on his 
magnificent colorcycling-look-at-it-now-look-at-your-hand-it's-moving 
screen. I felt like smoking my head off that day, so I bought two packs of 
Marlboro at the machine downstairs. Within an hour, the first one was 
empty, thanks to Mantra and my humble self. I then went for the remaining 
Blue Curacao, washed it down with half a liter FAXE Lager. That afternoon, 
I had the pleasure to play carpet soccer against Slimer (apart from his 
passing, shooting, agility, tactical thinking, overview and reflexes (they 
all suck), he is quite a good player). At around twelve o'clock, everybody 
went out for the picnic. As usual, I was late and I had to search for the 
picnic place quite long. When I found it, my first reaction was to walk 
away. It was appaling. Fifteen (physically) grownups, sitting in a neat 
circle around an orange cloth with ducklings on it, sipping lemonade with 
straws and eating breadrolls with cheese and salami. Enter the Dutch scene. 
I regrouped my thoughts and sat down in between of these mentally unfit 
persons. And found out it was very cool. The behaviour of us Dutchies might 
seem strange to you, but you've got to be there to understand what is going 
on. For your mental sake, I will not tell you what we have discussed out 
there. After about half an hour, we went inside again and rebooted the 
normal party(non)behaviour. Bonus stole a Jaguar and went playing with it. 
We only smoked and drank beer until the competitions began. As I've 
understood they will be discussed somewhere else in the magazine, I will 
only give you my personal view on the results. The shorttro competition was 
faked, the music competition had one good entry (Synergy!), the graphics 
compo was okay and I missed most of the demo competition because I was at 
the Mac with Goof and Fox at the same moment. That's enough I guess. Later 
in the night, we all had massive discussions (the kind of talk you always 
have the night before you go home) and most guys decided to sleep a few 
hours. I didn't. I stayed up all night, saw the sun reappearing and packed 
all my stuff after it had become 1200 military. I don't know much about the 
travel back, because I was asleep almost all of the time. 
 
 
Thanks and greetings.
