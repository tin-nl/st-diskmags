12:45  Integer is a popper.   
 
12:46 ...and Fried is a Popniete ! 
 
12:46  Integer is a looser 
 
12:47 ...and Fried is ne dumme SAU !!! 
 
12:47 integer ist ein scheiss scheiss kack scheiss scheisser. 
 
12:48 Hey MANN !!!  Fried ist so richtig beschissen (zu dumm zum Kacken) 
 
12:49 integer ist voll lieb 
 
12:50 Weisst du was, Fried ?  ...waere ich doch schwul, dann wuerde ich dich 
jetzt so richtig (im Sine von RICHTIG!) nehmen (bumsen bis zum Lachen...) 
 
12:52  So, now i will punish you again with some shit. shit. there. 
       I did it. now what? the competition is over our demo failed  
       but who gifsafuck? My brain hurts. I believe in bashing two bricks 
       together. Okay, okay. Okay, man, i mean okay. I mean like okay,okay? 
       so. okay. Hold it this is boring right? Yo rapper. anyone who can 
       find the (he mann!! pruef das nach!) sense in what i have just written 
       please go to cashier 6 immediately. now that i mention it, cashiers 
       are a realy ineresting subject. i have the definitive opinion that 
       +++=====++++++++++++++++++++++++==================+++ 
       (short break for Inti):    VANESSA IST JA SOOOOOOOO   GEIL !!!!! 
        ++++++++++++++++++++++=====+++++++++++++++==========+++++++++=== 
        ok, that was Integers part of this shit - let`s continue: 
        i was just interrupted, but somehow i do not know why. integer 
        thinks i write shit. so now for some really important stuff. 
 
               war is not very good. 
 
       phew. got that over with. now back to shit. was hat ein mann ohne 
       beine? ERDNUESSE. har har har har har har har har har har har har 
       har har har har har har har har har har. MTV pops.  I feel like eating 
       our demo, but it doesn't taste good. i think i will try the brown 
       coding method employed by the people who made trupaint. it involves 
       farting into the ram repeatedly and selling it as software. help!! 
       HELP!! a full sentence!!! aaarg   thimps  bramp  rottikuh kant 
       lieber sigmund als garkeinen mund. sigmund freud sich. albert 
       ein stein oder nicht?  nein nie .    and now for something completely 
       the same. anyway, his name was "rennpferd" but actually it wasn't 
       anymore. his name was "burnburnyesyouregonnaburn" but his friends 
       called her "lip dig dig". she was 2 years older than herself and 
       had a pair of legs so sexy that she had to,have them registered and 
       obtain a license. actually she plays no role in this story whatsoever, 
       but she also has  tits you wouldn't believe and so i thought i'd 
mention her. but as the story doesn't revolve around her i will drop her 
after i tell you what kind of a butt she has. so when she had got out of my 
story a livesize streptococcus entered the room and noone took notice as it 
was 10^-7 m big and of no importance to anyone. then the cow hit him in the 
face doing a tripple backward overhead flop that it had learned in kung fu 
class. amazing the people by doing this it bacame a star and had several face 
and hornlifts done until it became known in showbiz as loriot. so they made a 
house for them to live in and they did but it was so boring that not even i 
will write about it. i should drink something, that would maybe add a bit of 
spice to this text. fried off, but i'll be back (and drunk maybe?) 
 
01.16 Hi Guzs, here is Questor on the Keys. The Deadline of the Democompition 
is over and my FX still doesn`t work correctly on a RGB-Monitor. So i kick 
the Screen and code it completly new. (SHIT!) So y later... 
 
1:37  hey! isn't anyone gonna write something in between? ich wollte nur 
anmerken: jet power hat bett power. ich sauf nu nix weil wegen und so. ich 
bin echt millionen fertig und koennte kotzen aufgrund des akuten mangels an 
funktionstuchtigkeit mit dem die demo mich zu versehen gedachte. Front 6 
hoert rick asthley.  
 
1:47 So i just came back after i showed our demo on the big screen it looked 
nice and long. I don't know what to write anymore. So wait and see what 
happens. Wingleader/Synergy  
 
1:52 I also just came back after playing Crapman for a while on a very 
big screen. It still play's very nice !!!!!  Bonus 
 
1:53 Hi, Samurai from Inter now on the keys just to tell ya that TFC is Dead 
They entered our group today and we are very glad to have new and good 
members in our Group. You can also expect a Demo from us in the next time. 
It will contain Devil-Plasma, Holographic-Pictures, Realtime Transforming and 
maybe even Morphing, RGB spliter, UFO`s and a lot of coool and wierd  
Tridi stuff. 
 
2:21 Now there's Lucky of ST on the keys. As Samurai said we habe joined 
Inter today. We are glad too. Now we have someone to show how to make goood 
code... 
But it's untrue that TFC is dead. There are still some members left, but 
they never have done anything for TFC. Just wait for our new demo. But do not 
expect all the stuff Samurai was talking 'bout! Much more, but even different 
thing will be in it. 
See ya! Lucky of ST (Inter / The Independant) 
 
2:27 Still here... 
 
2:28 Lost in Space?!?!!??? 
 
2:29 Dizzy. 
 
2:36 There has been a fraud working on the results of the competition. They 
are fucked up. Just add up all the ratings from the different parts and check 
for yourself. WE ARE BEING FUCKED!!! Don't let yourself be ruled by the 
system... Signed: The Dutch Scene Storyteller. 
 
Powa is stupid said Slimer!! 
 
Raltime speaking POWA IS stupid!!!  I've gone and hurt my elbow by jumping up 
to grab a piece of paper stuck to the ceiling. Tymem, Leon & Chrome were 
there and watched me as I busted my elbow.  I've got a plaster on it now but 
it still hurts like hell!!!   Wot a wally!!!! 
 
Powa himself (of The Mega 4) 
 
As i said before Powa is stupid, Slimer 
 
03:47 Moondog is back on track! Yep,our shortro has reached the 3rd place 
      in the shortro-compo. Uhh,i'm too tired to write more bullshit in eng- 
      lish. Es ist echt aetzend (scheiss tastatur...). Ich habe hier be- 
      stimmt 50 Charts-Frageboegen verteilt und keiner kuemmert sich drum. 
      Naja,jedenfalls sind ein paar saugoile Demos rausgekommen,die die 
      Charts bestimmt umwerfen werden,ich sage nur: AUTOWASCHEN VERBOTEN 
      oder PLASTIC VIBRATIONS.... geiler Stoff! Vergesst Warum? und Chaos 
      A.D.... aber auch das Mugwumps-Teil is nich uebel... cooler Trance- 
      Stuff... Trance (SCHEISS TASTATUR!!!) Techno rulez!!! Achso,tnb rollt 
      immernoch... Tschuess,wir (tnb) werden wohl bald aufbrechen muessen! 
      Es war echt 'ne goile Paady... Moondog of tnb siging off... See ya  
      on the next paady (SCHEISS TASTATUR!!!!!!!! Shitty keyboard!!!!)

     Here`s the list of my all-time favourite Coding Conventions on Atari:

       I hope I`ll have the chance to visit some more parties this year. 
       I was even plannin to organize an own little party, but I`ve yet 
       some prblems with finding a suitable place for it. 
 
       Bye from Quark, Fried Bits was surely a big pleasure ! 
 
 
3:40 PM Well here's MaNtRa on the keyboard mayby shitting around for the last 
       time on this text, So if you have enjoyed this shit, you're my type of 
person (can't say man coz there's females too!!) So whats happenin in this 
house rite now.... 
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                             EKSAKTLY... NUTTIN'. So what the 
party was cool, the demo's were great...  
 
3:45    shit, Danny O., Rippguy and Sepp Jo are gone now and so Mc Fly and me 
        are the last members of Risk at the Fried II. Well, seems to be a 
        littlle  bit more silent in the rooms since they`re gone (tough 
        shit!) 
        I`m going (have) to sleep now, maybe there will be some further lines 
        by me (hehe, you`re warned!)  
                        so,  "gute Nacht Jungs, Inti geht jetzt ins 
                                               Bettchen!" 
        PS: I`ll give the keys to Havoc now ("Havoc ! - you`re soooooo NICE!) 
         
 
04:12 This is O.T.M. telling you:" GOOD NIGHT!" 
 
5:18 HAVOC HERE... (Who the fuck left the capslock on? Fuck him...) We're 
bullshitting down here at the moment, Still up are: Mantra, Beavis, Chrome, 
Powa and Havoc (autosave).. We're talking about: graffiti, Falcon, muzix, 
coke, beer, blue curacao, Falcon, design, fades, Falcon, development, Atari 
logos, Cybermorph, Falcon, DSP, Falcon,  USA, Falcon 040, and more secrets. 
 
05:47 Moondog... und tschuess.... bye bis zur nexten Paady.... 
 
07:21 Ooh yes this is the future now man. 
That fucking demo's they showed us last night were so fucking brilliant that 
most of our friends were toltally impressed with them. We are talking about 
some major spectcular stuff that will impress everybody, even the most 
stubborn PC freak. ( it will be real hard for amiga's (aga) to do something 
like it. Lets go get those demo's. 
 
07:31 Only another 35 minutes left until I make my way home back to London. 
Well.. what can I say...  except that I've had a REALLY GREAT time at this 
party.  I've met up with so many faces from previous encounters (many of 
those encounters were good ones).  If there's another party, I'll do my best 
to be there...  By the way a special message to Tommy (who is in hospital) 
Get well soon Tommy... I'm sorry I couldn't see you here at the party. 
 Andreas has just told me that Tommy is recovering well.  As for The Mega 4, 
we'll keep on coding away, and we will return will some nice new shiny 
demoscreens.  Powa sez... SEES YAS LATERS!!!

Seems to be a better way to fill up text, eh? 
 
Don't be pissed about the quality of this little ASCII-art, it was conceived 
by two tired Krauts struggling with Tempus and an unknown english keyboard. 
After more than 120.4 manhours without sleep, it's real fun to do this! HI 
here is the second Guy, who have drawn this Logo.... Now I`m a little bit 
less tired, because i just have eaten a coffeetablet. Now I want to stretch 
this article with the hottest news at the szene. Oh, but at first I want to 
write something about the party-acions. At the moment the first guys are 
waking up (exept 5 or 6 people who have coded in the night). It`s the last 
day at the Fried Bit`s II-Party and i can say, it was a big success. Some 
groups are after the party bigger, others are smaller. All guzs copy the 
winner-demos of the competition. Hottest news: Tom G and Questor have Coffee 
to wake up!!!!!!! It`s very important, because we have already weierd 
imaginations... But the help is comming: THE COFFEE! 
huh mh huh, coffee rulez!.... But now wait, because we want to drink our 
coffee...At last a big message to all others: DO ASCII-ART.... 
 
09:07 Have you ever waken up with the feeling that ya've been overrun by 
      a very large truck driven by a little red dwarf. 
       
      Well, that's how i'm feelin' right now...... Slimer 
 
09:30 Have you ever been up all night and then, after thirty-six hours of 
bullshit, played a game of carpet soccer against Slimer? And ofcourse I won 
gloriously. No surprise. Havoc. Maybe I'm lucky the next time by getting an 
real opponent. I'm just criticising people while wearing Scav's Donald Duck 
cap. Just felt it once more 
 
Slimer is cool. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Just jokin... 
Pinda, walnoot, cashew, beukenoten. 
I wanna play carpet soccer. 
Jes, I do. 
Backup coming up. 
Slimer is approaching me. 
I'm scared. 
I'll save this file. 
OK Slimer? 
Okey, op A. 
Okey.

This a demo of the jpeg to a new format which is ALWAYS about 2kb.
I called it JPEG>ASCII.
