The RIFF File Format

WAV files use the RIFF file structure. The RIFF format was designed
for multi-media purposes. A RIFF files consists of a number of "chunks":

 Byte              Length                                               
 Offset   Name   (in bytes)    Description                              
 
 00h      rID        4h        Contains the characters "RIFF"           
 04h      rLen       4h        The length of the data in the next chunk 
 08h      rData     rLen       The data chunk                           
 

The WAVE Form Definition

The rData chunk in a WAV file is split up into several further chunks:

 rData                                                                   
 Byte              Length                                                
 Offset   Name   (in bytes)    Description                               

 00h      wID        4h        Contains the characters "WAVE"            
 04h      Format    14h        Contains data which specifies the format  
          Chunk                  of the Data in the Data Chunk           
 18h      WAVE Data  ?         Contains the WAV audio data               
          Chunk                                                          


The Format Chunk

The Format Chunk is split up into these fields:

Format                                                                  
Chunk                  Length                                           
Offset  Name         (in bytes)   Description                           

 00h     fId               4       Contains the characters "fmt"        
 04h     fLen              4       Length of data in the format chunk    
 08h     wFormatTag        2       *                                     
 0Ah     nChannels         2       Number of channels, 1=mono, 2=stereo  
 0Ch     nSamplesPerSec    2       Playback frequency                    
 0Eh     nAvgBytesPerSec   2       **                                    
 10h     nBlockAlign       2       ***                                   
 12h     FormatSpecific    2       Format specific data area             


* The wFormatTag specifies the wave format, eg 1 = Pulse Code Modulation
  (or in plain english, regular 8 bit sampled uncompressed sound)

** Indicates the average number of bytes a second the data should be
   transferred at = nChannels * nSamplesPerSec * (nBitsPerSample / 8)

*** Indicates the block alignment of the data in the data chunk. Software
    needs to process a multiplt of nBlockAlign at a time.
    nBlockAlign = nChannels * (nBitsPerSample / 8)


The Data Chunk 

The Data Chunk is split up into these fields:

 Data                                                                   
 Chunk                  Length                                           
 Offset  Name         (in bytes)   Description                           

 00h     dId              4        Contains the characters "data"        
 02h     dLen             4        Length of data in the dData field     
 00h     dData            dLen     The actual waveform data              


In mono 8-bit files each byte represents one sample. In stereo 8-bit files
two bytes are stored for each sample, the first byte is the left channel
value, the next is the right channel value.
