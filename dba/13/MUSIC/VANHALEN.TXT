"Right Here, Right Now" is the second live recording by the U.S. rock band
"Van Halen" (based around two Dutch born brothers Alex and Eddie Van Halen).
I'm going to review the CD because i don't have the video of this concert and
i'm not planning to buy it either( not even if it's good ).
So, lets talk Compact Disc.........

There seems to be a difference of opinion among the real "Van Halen" fans 
about this recording, some of them think it's totally crap and the others say 
it's totally brilliant.
Well, i share the opinion of the last group and say that RH, RN is one hell of
a live CD.
I must agree with the first group that it isn't the Van Halen from the early
days anymore and with the fact that there are almost no tracks on it from the
David Lee Roth era !
Ofcourse as always the difference of opinion go also about Sammy Hagar and
David Lee Roth, but I personally think that Sammy is quite okay !

Sammy Hagar(45 years old) has experienced a long solo career before he joined 
Van Halen, it was quite a good one too.
Right, lets return from the history files and concentrate a bit more on the
CD, shall we !?
As i said in the opening sentence this is the second live recording, the first
was "Live Without a Net" and is only recorded on video and as far as i know, not
on (officially, maybe on a bootleg )CD.
Was there a need to do another live concert video this short after the first
one ( the first one is only a couple of years old ) ??
Yes, not only is RH, RN a 15 year anniversary present to the fans, it's also
an attempt of the band to show their fans where they exactly are in time and
music at the moment.

                     RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW....

The whole live recording is spread out over two compact disc's containing 
140.92 minutes of music !
All of it was recorded in (as it seems to me) in Fresno but it's hard to
make out where it is recorded because they mention nothing on the CD case or
in the booklet !
I know that they did record something in Fresno in a club called "The Whiskey"
it's the club where the got signed up for the first time after playing a gig.
In the middle of the Panama track Sammy mentions Fresno, but it could be that
they combined several songs from different live gigs on this CD.

It's a pitty that they didn't play "Running with the Devil" on their 15 year
anniversary though !
Sammy said in "Metal CD"  magazine that he only picked the songs he liked and
intentionally didn't sing most of David Lee Roth's songs.

QUOTE: " I couldn't do all those raps or some of those lyrics because it's not
me, So I had to choose the songs i'm comfortable with "

Almost all tracks of the "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" CD are on the live CD
and only a few tracks of the David Lee Roth era.
Behind every song i typed the title of the CD where it was taken from....

As you probably already noticed the CD contains some " unknown " songs and
covers that we have never heard of "Van Halen" before.
"Won't Get Fooled Again" is orginally performed by "The Who" (it's written
by Pete Townshend of the same band).
"One Way To Rock" and "Give To Live" are both written by Sammy Hagar and can
only be found on this CD.

I'm not familier with the F.U.C.K. CD but after hearing the live versions of
almost all the tracks on this RH, RN CD, i became very enthusiast about them !
Personally I think that"Van Halen" has become better in song writing but a
disadvantage however is the fact that the lost the "rough" edges.
From "1984" on they used keyboards and the songs became a bit more commercial
tainted, but that seems to be the way most groups go these days.
A little example is for instance Guns 'N Roses, just look at the first CD and
at the last ones.......

                                CONCLUDING,

Although most tracks come from the F.U.C.K. CD, it turned out to be a very 
good live CD.
Without any doubt i can say that "Van Halen" was one of the best live groups
and still is with Sammy Hagar as frontman.
"Guitar-Eddie" is as always great, listen to Poundcake, Pleasure Dome, You
Really Got Me and Won't Get Fooled Again.
Alex does some mean things to his drumkit and Michael shows the 1000 ways to
rape the bass guitar.
Even Sammy plays good guitar, with "Van Halen" you still hear four very very
good musicians do things that most groups never even come close of doing....

                          Slimer saying BUY NOW, PAY LATER

P.S. There also special editions of this CD containing a backstage pass or
     ticket of the concert.
     Watch the CD's with the white stickers on them.
