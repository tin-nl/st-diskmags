INTERVIEW WITH ZEME OF DAWN
===========================
       by Slimer

Here's another interview with a person who's responsible for
a very good PD program. His pseudo name is 'Zeme' of Dawn, 
this Dutch group has recently changed it's name. Before they
renamed them selves to Dawn they were known as Odyssey. 
Although they never managed to become a big name on the 
Atari scene they do belong to the small Dutch scene.

The most recent software release came in the form of a 
program called DFC. You can find a copy of it on the 
previous D.B.A. magazine. DFC allows you to install multiple 
applications in the desktop, programs are now allowed to 
recognize more than one extension ! Quite nice, and reason 
for me to interview the coder behind it all.....

INTERVIEW

CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF 
(BIRTHDAY, HOBBY'S OR WORK) ?

 Birthday: march 31 (every year since '76)
 Hobbies: MIDI composing, programming (where's the interesting
 stuff?!), electronic 'basteleien', computer-math-stuff.
 Currently I am attending school, so no superb money earnings
 here (sigh).

ARE THERE PARTICULAR PERSONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET IN 
YOUR LIFE (WRITER, ARTISTS OR OTHERS) !?

 Kurt Cobain

IF SO, WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST QUESTION IN YOUR MIND TO 
ASK HIM/HER ?

 Why the HELL did you kill yourself???!!!

WHICH MUSIC TASTE(S) DO YOU LIKE AND WHAT EQUIPMENT DO 
YOU USE TO PLAY IT WITH !?

 Nirvana, Alice in Chains, U2 and occasionally some
 'general' music (like Deep Forest etc).
 All played by my CD & DCC players (what does 'analogue'
 mean again?)
                               
WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT COMPUTER SETUP (INCLUDING SOME 
HISTORY, LIKE YOUR FIRST MACHINE) ?

 First : Sharp MZ800 (sort of a MSX but not)
 Then  : ST (3 Mb, no HD)
 Now   : Falcon 030/4/85-VGA   

CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR TRUE AND HONEST OPINION ABOUT THE 
FUTURE OF THE FALCON AND ATARI AS A WHOLE !?

 I am _v_e_r_y_ reserved at this point, both the Falcon's and
 Atari's future depend on the Jaguar sales. The Jag is a HOT
 machine, but if Atari doesn't do some good advertising soon
 even such a HOT machine won't make it. What about some
 MARKETING, Atari?
 
WHICH COMPUTER PROGRAMS DO YOU LIKE TO SEE MORE FOR THE 
FALCON ?

 - A good soundtracker for 16 bit samples (This DIGITAL tracker
   looks promising, but lacks some important features like
   precise panning per channel (not just left, middle or
   right)).
 - A good GFA-alike basic which takes full advantage of what
   my birdy can do.
 - Games (especially to increase Falcon sales, almost every-
   body likes to play a game once in a while). 

WHEN WAS 'DFC' CREATED AND WHAT GAVE YOU THE IDEA IN 
THE FIRST PLACE !?

 I was messing around with this 'Install application' option
 from the desktop. Yuck! You can only type one extension here!
 Yuck! My NEWDESK.INF is too big! Error messages!
 Then I figured that I could do something about this...!

ARE YOU PLANNING ANY FUTURE PROJECTS?

 I always am, but I'm still attending school, so no big projects
 can be expected soon...
 I am 'suffering' from this typical 'syndrome': <Always planning,
 never performing>.
  
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE FALCON SCENE AND THE COMPUTER 
SCENE AS A WHOLE ?

 Too small. The complete scene is too crowded by PC's.
 There are enough potential Falcon buyers, but a lot of them can't
 stand the PC-seduction, Atari doesn't offer them enough (faster,
 better and more expandable Falcons for example, but software too).

DO YOU SEE PIRACY AS A THEFT (PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY) ?

 Yes. It's usually a huge amount of work that the authors have
 put into developing their program. They should get the money
 they deserve.
 But: It's simply too easy to copy software, it's hard to resist
 copying that wonderful game. It's like a shop where you can take
 things with you and pay by transferring the money later. How many 
 of us would 'forget' to pay since they don't have your name...
 Well, somebody's got to come with a bloody smart solution here!

COULD YOU SHARE YOUR OPINION ON DISKMAGAZINES WITH US ?

 Yes. Handy, compact, cheap, tree-saving, doesn't need a cover-
 disk, the cover IS a disk!

IT THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MENTION TO OUR 
READERS ? 

 Nope.
