INTERVIEW : MACDO of Extremely Kriminal Organization (E.K.O.)
=============================================================
                    by Slimer

E.K.O. is one of the leading demogroups on the Falcon. Their demo's feature
great code, graphics and of course modules. Responsible for the modules and
design of the E.K.O. productions is 'MACDO'. We don't know that much about the
group and it's members, reason for me to send them an interview ...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERVIEW:  

CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF FIRST (BIRTHDAY, HOBBIES OR WORK) ?

Well, I'm a student in English. I'm 23 . I'm Sagittarius, does it
interests anyone ?? and my hobbies ??? Soundtrack and Techno live parties. 
I also play guitar, bass guitar, piano and sometimes drums.


COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR FUNCTION WITHIN E.K.O. ?

I make the musics of all E.K.O. Productions. But since the beginning
of E.K.O. I also make the design of our demos. (There's some design ???)


WERE YOU ALREADY ACTIVE IN PREVIOUS DEMOGROUPS BEFORE E.K.O. WAS FORMED
(IF SO WHICH ONES) ?

I was only making soundtracks for me. In 1991 I met Maxx-out and we
decided to build up  - Extremely Kriminal Organization -.


ARE THERE PARTICULAR PERSONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET IN YOUR LIFE 
(WRITER, ARTISTS OR OTHERS) !?

Only musicians like : Art of Noise - The Prodigy - Nuke (spaceman).
and Jamiroquai.

IF SO, WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST QUESTION IN YOUR MIND TO ASK HIM/HER ?

Hello

Tell me how you do to make those wonderful tunes....


HOW DO YOU SEE THE FUTURE OF COMPUTING AFTER THE YEAR 2000 ?

Hum... good question. Everybody will have PC's and the demos won't
exist anymore because all the things which could be done will be done
We are actually living the BEST days of the demos and that's why we are
making some.  


WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT COMPUTER SETUP (INCLUDING SOME HISTORY, LIKE 
YOUR FIRST MACHINE) ?
    
    Well I think that I had a C128, yes I had.
    
    After I had an STf in 1985 (U remember 1 sided drives ?)
    and 360 Kb formatted disks ??

    I bought a STe

    I bought a Falcon

    I bought an Amiga 1200

  

CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR TRUE AND HONEST OPINION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE 
FALCON AND ATARI AS A WHOLE !?

Atari made a big mistake with the Falcon. I mean that they waited too long 
before selling out the Falcon. Atari was living with the sellings of the
STf and STe's. They should have known that the Amiga will be one day 
stronger.

We can hope that the Falcon will take the same way that the Amiga took.
At the beginning the Amiga was too expensive and it's only a few 
years later that he became popular...Hope the Falcon will do the same.


IS THE FALCON SCENE A STRONGER AND MORE MOTIVATED ONE THAN THAT OF THE
OTHER COMPUTER PLATFORMS ?

Of course not. How many groups are there on Falcon 8 ?? maybe 10 ??
(I mean people who make demos). I think that the main problem is
still the price of the computer. Everybody's not able to buy a
4500 Francs (about 900 $) computer. But all Atari guys still
remember the wonderful years we had with the - ST -.
 
WHICH COMPUTER PROGRAMS DO YOU LIKE TO SEE MORE ON THE FALCON ?

For me of course music programs. I mean programs like sound-
trackers. Some drawing programs of course...And a 'Maupiti Island'
Falcon version. (I love this game).

DO YOU SEE PIRACY AS A THEFT (PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY) ?

I, of course see piracy as a theft. Especially when you are making
yourself some games or programs. But I really can't blame people
who are cracking. Who, one day, didn't have a copy of a program. Tell 
me WHO ??


COULD YOU SHARE YOUR OPINION ON DISKMAGAZINES WITH US ?

Of course. E.K.O. is also making a diskmag. All the groups should do
like this. It would be nice to see real pictures of all the
different groups and some informations given by the coders which
could help all the boys who are beginning on this machine.


WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE ATARI SPECIFIC COMPUTER (PAPER) MAGAZINES
IN FRANCE ?

Hum.. In France we only have 2 or 3 Magazines which are speaking of the 
Falcon. In Germany there are also 2 or 3 Mags. It's, of course not enough.
But it's comprehensible. Who is gonna buy those mags ?? only the
Falcon owners ??...


IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MENTION TO OUR READERS ? 

Yes, if anybody wants to write us. There is no problem. Be sure
there will be an answer. Keep on coding and let's make Atari
scene stronger than before.
