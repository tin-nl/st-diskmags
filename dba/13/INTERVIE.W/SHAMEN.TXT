What do you think of demo's in general (good ,bad, more...)...      (3 LINES)
I love them!, there is nothing like a good demo (any format,... I've seen some
really good demos on the C-64, better than aything on the Amiba!)

Cool guys (since I myself are a member of a crew), if you like to show off, 
then I suggest that you join a crew!!!

Multiparts!!!, probably with optional menus (if the multipart is very long,   
otherwise it's pointless!)

Do you like compil menu disk's and explain your answer...           (3 LINES)
I like the once that contains other peoples intros (like Animal Mine G.S.C's) 
I don't like pirated software, even though I think it's the game companies 
fault that their software gets pirated (the price you know!)

What do you think about Atari Corp. itself (enough info/back_up etc) (3 LINES)
It  S U C K S ! ! !, you can't get anything good out of Atari Corp. except 
their brilli machines,... ST/STE, FALCON and their new *H*O*T* JAGUAR!!!!!,...
Their info sucks, and so does their followups!

Do you likes the games that are out for the Atari (new, playable etc)(3 LINES)
Yess... I do! I think they are well playable, although some are less colourful
than on the PC or Amiba (but who the F***K cares???)

What's your opinion about software piracy on the ST/E                (3 LINES)
I've already answered that quest!

Would you buy more original software is the prices were lower ?      (1 LINE)

ST Format (what a question!) and 'Svenska Hemdator Nytt' and sometimes some   
other crappy mags, but mainly the once above!

What do you think of them ( Contents, up to date, sort of articles)  (3 LINES)
ST Format... Brilli, no other mag contain so much info 'bout the Atari than ST
Format... There is al you'll ever need to know,... And more!                
Svenska Hemdata,.. since I'm employed by it.... IT'S GREAT (at least my page!)

Nothing for the moment!

Do you like the idea of a diskmagazine in general...                 (3 LINES)

How would you describe a 'lamer'                                     (3 LINES)
A person who steals other peoples code, tells everybody how good he is, but
never does anything, because he cannot code (anyone I know that's feeling   
pointed out???, someone in Wildfire perhaps???)

What do you think about the subject 'lamer(s)'                       (3 LINES)
Well, what can you say,.... They excist, even though the shouldn't,... but    
can we blame them??? No, therefore man invented the condom, sothat no LAMERS
could be born! Adivise......       KEEP YAR CONDOMS ON!!!!!!!!!!!

Any tips/hints or advise for them ???                                (3 LINES)
Yea... Take your daddys gun from the gunraft,... point the end with a hole  
in, at your head,... no seriously,.. since we've all been LAMERS (except me, 
ofcourse)... Stop stealing, start thinking out stuff on your own, 
to code is fun!!!!


Talking about lamers, how did you start computing ???                (3 LINES)
I got my C-64 back in 84-85 (I cannot remember),.. I only played games then,
didn't even bother to lurke into the 64 basic,... I only enjoyed this for a 
couple of years, so in 1990 I got my first ST (and there you have it!!!)
