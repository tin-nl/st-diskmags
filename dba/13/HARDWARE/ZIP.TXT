THE ZIP DRIVE
~ATARI.FIL~ ~RED_GREN.PAL~
The zip drive was introduced on the CeBit in Germany and the 
manufactor claimes it will be a new era in data storage. 

The Zip drive is a small portable solution for the transport of larger 
data files. The disks that this drive uses aren't  bigger than a 
normal 1,44 Inch disk but they have a storage capacity of 100 Mb. Thats 
about **** much more than that normal disk !!!!. There are already 2
versions on the market, a SCSI version and a "printer port" version.

The Zip drive has according to Srini Nageshwar of Iomega 4 purposes in 
mind: 1) Extra data space for that always full harddisk,
      2) A sollution for mobile storage,
      3) A kind of organiser for lots of files,
      4) And ofcourse a perfect back-up media.
      
It is an SCSI device so it should also be possible to hook one up to a 
Falcon or a TT. Non details further know but read the messages in next
issues or Internet.
 
The Iomega Zip drive is selling for $199 US at any Mac mail (Thats in 
the U.S., don't know any addresses here in Europe at this time) order
place.  The cartrdiges are $19.95 or 10 for $149.  I haven't seen the 
parallel port version of the Zip drive actually available anywhere yet, 
but it's supposed to be on its way shortly.
  
In Germany the Zip drive is also available at the suggested retail price
of 349 to 399 Deutsche Mark, a pretty reasonable price for a complete unit.

In Holland the Zip drive will set you back 445,- guilders for a complete
unit (drive and one disk) and a single disk will cost around 45,- guilders.
It still beats a Syquest so consider your next move carefully when it involves data
storage....
