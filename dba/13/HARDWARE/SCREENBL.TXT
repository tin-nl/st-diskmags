The Screenblaster

Here it is the special version for the Atari Falcon 030. Many people 
already know Overscan with the Screenblasters from the ST and TT 
serie's. But They just couldn't leave it to it so here is the final 
version for our newest toy the Falcon.

The Screenblaster is a hardware based resolution expander for the 
Atari Falcon 030. A resolution up to 880x608 pixels is possible on a 
S-VGA screen. Since the Screenblaster is simply plugged between the 
Faclon 030 and the S-VGA monitor there is no installation ( read 
soldering or sort of ) required !. The Screenblaster software allows 
you to choose from a multitude of resolutions such as:

   Resolution      Vsync      Screensize

    640x480        61 Hz      100 % (without Screenblaster)
   1152x832        87 Hz Int. 312 %
    880x600        61 Hz      174 %  
    800x600        67 Hz      158 %
    640X480        80 Hz      100 %

(P.S. it seems that the last resolution is the same as the first but 
remember that with the higher Hz the picture is much clearer and looks 
more solid, just like switchen between 50/60 Hz)

They also supply 14,15 and 17" S-VGA monitors (as well as low 
radiation/ low emission models). Screenblaster also works  with the 
SM 124/144/146 Atari Monitors and 15 Khz RGB Monitors. You can also 
use some of the higher resolutions of them.


VRAM 030

VRAM is a powerful virtual memory-management software for all 68030 
CPU based Atari computers (TT, FALCON and ST's with 030 speedup 
boards). Based on the size of the swap-partition, up to two 
GIGAbyte  will be addressed as virtual memory. VRAM works with the 
best optimised algorithems. Data safety and speed was the top priority 
by the design of VRAM. All kind of harddisk are supported ( SCSI, IDE 
and ACSI). TOS version 2.05 and higher will work with VRAM. Machines 
with TT Ram onboard  will also gain and TOS acceleration of about 35% 
in speed.

Falcon Genlock/Overlay

Yes there is now also a Genlock for the Falcon 030. Genlock allows 
you to mix video pictures with computerized graphics ( picture formats 
like: .IMG, .XIMG, .GIF, .TGA, Degas, .NEO etc). The computer image is 
imprinted upon the video picture. The Falcons Overlay Bit is supported
The necessery software for titling is also available. The new title-
generating software is strictly resolution independent. All ST,STE,TT 
and Falcon (including Screenblaster) resolution are supported.Overlay 
also supports Speedo GDOS font scaler. Overlay works object-oriented 
e.g. all texts and pictures can be selected individually and 
manipulated at all times. Pictures of any color resolution and depth 
can be loaded in every video mode: the adaptation is optimized 
through color dithering. You can design slideshows using lots of 
special effects, such as multi directional scrolling, pattern effects 
and the timing feature of Overlay.You can even load and play music 
with Overlay. Various kinds of sound formats (like AVR, WAV and AU) 
are supported. Mono, Stereo, different kind of sample rates up until 
CD quality. The result can be saved again on VHS tape and shown.
Overlay is capable of a lot more than can be described here.
