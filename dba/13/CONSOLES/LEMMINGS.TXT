LEMMINGS FOR LYNX

LYNX Review


Lemmings


Hi! It's me again, and this time with Lemmings for the LYNX.
Let's start reviewing.


By DMA Design.

First let me tell you what Lemmings are.(for the one's who don't know)
Lemmings are cute little animals, but they're brainless.
If they walk into the water, they don't think:"Hey I can't swim".
No....they just walk further untill they'll die.
And you've got to help them.

The game.

After 3 title pictures, you get the the intro of the game.
It's the same as the ST version, but this has music.
The Lemmings logo at the end of the intro zooms in and the screen 
fades away.

Now there appears the title screen where you can choose between:
PLAY, NEW LEVEL, MUSIC on/off, Fun, Tricky, Taxing & Mayhem.

-Play-
Guess what that option's for? 

-New level-
Here you can enter codes for a new level.
The codes are real words like: wefalldown,lemmgfinal (OOOOPS! 
Gave one away).

-Music on/off-
Turn music on or off.
This can also be done while playing.
By pressing opt.2

-Fun, Tricky, Taxing & Mayhem-
These are the level skills.
Fun is easy, Tricky is harder, Taxing is even harder and Mayhem 
is the hardest level.


OK Let's go! (let's play the game)

The meaning of the game is, that you have to lead the Lemmings to 
the exit in time.
You must also rescue for e.g. 50% of the Lemmings.
That means if you have 100 Lemmings, you must save 50 of them.
Got it?

It's the same as the ST version but the items you can chose are 
in an other screen.
That means when you want a digger you can pause the game press 
"B" and choose the digger.

There's also a fast forward option in the game.
You can activate it with opt. 1


The items:

-Climber-
This Lemming can climb walls.

-Floater-
This Lemming has an umbrella so he won't drop dead on the ground.

-Bomber- 
To blow up a Lemming if it must.

-Blocker-
This Lemming stops the other Lemmings.(he blocks their way)

-Builder-
This Lemming builds bridges and ramps to across big open places.

-Bashers-
This Lemming can dig horizontally through nonmetallic obstacles.

-Miners-
This Lemming can dig diagonal tunnels through dirt & rocks.

-Diggers-
To dig straight down.


After that you've completed a level you get the password for the 
next and if you didn't made it, you may try again.
At the start of every level you get some information, the name of 
the level, the rate they drop into your screen, how much Lemmings 
there are, how much Lemmings you must save and how much minutes 
you have to clear the job.


It's a good game, although you've got the game on your ST you can 
also get for your LYNX because it always keeps you bussy.
The last level is so easy that I've finished the game allready.
At the end there's a.... Should I tell it?
No.....you'll see it some time.


The Ratings:

Coding:
It's a very nice game.
I think it's better than the Amiga version.

Graphics:
They look the same as on ST but I think they look better.
I don't know, but it must be my imatination.

Sound:
The samples are good and the music is typical Lemming music.

Gameplay:
It plays better than the ST version, because you've got more time 
to choose an item.
But to pick a Lemming goes better with mouse.

Total:
As I've said before, it's a good game.
If you're a puzzle fan, it's worth to buy it.
