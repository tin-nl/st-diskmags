==== INTRODUCTION ============================================================


I don't think that it is necessary to introduce NAD to you, in other articles
and previous D.B.A. mags you can find enough about this firm.
After I bought the NAD 3240 amplifier I didn't expect to buy another component
so soon for my (what they call) stereo installation.
It was more or less a coincidence that I saw the CD-Player standing on the
shelf in my fave Hi-Fi shop.
The 5440 is an 'older' type of CD-Player that just got replaced by the new
range of components of NAD.
It was standing beside the new range, so I thought that the CD-Player was
a left over.

It turned out to be a second-hand CD-Player that was only a year old.
The guy who 'dumped' it had bought a very expensive TEAC CD-Player instead 
for it.
That NAD 5440 was interesting me because it was of the same series as my
amplifier is.
My first thought was, that the 5440 was one of the lower class CD-Players of 
the NAD series and I expected to hear a low price for it.
The salesman also thought at that moment that it was a lower class player and
asked one of his colleague's what the price was.

He said that the player had a price of around 350 pounds(second-hand that is)
and was the top CD-Player of the series (around 500 pounds new) !
They also had the new range CD-Player in the shop (the NAD 5000) and this was 
an extremly good player for its money.
The NAD 5440 and 5000 turned out to be the same players with only a different
look (the 5000 has also a headphone jack).

The NAD 5000 was tested in the shop against the almost famous Marantz PM 80
player and the top player of Denon.
Both the Marantz and the Denon are costing almost double the price of the
NAD player.
Listening tests had proved that the NAD sounded better than the Marantz and
the same as the Denon.
This is ofcourse incredible for almost half the price because both the Marantz
and Denon are ranked as top CD-Players.

There are ofcourse always better players and that's why the guy who 'dumped'
the NAD had bought the top player of TEAC. 
You won't be suprised to hear that the TEAC has a very high price tag !

===== LISTENING TEST =========================================================


HOME SETUP,

NAD 3240 AMPLIFIER 
MONSTER CABLE 400 INTERLINK (between CD-Player and Amp)

BNS E14 SPEAKERS
OCF MONSTER CABLE (between the amp. and the speakers)

After listening to all these stories at the Hi-Fi shop it became time to 
listen for myself.
So, I took the NAD 5440 with me to my home and hooked it up with the NAD 3240
amplifier (see amplifier article).
They also gave me an OCF 400 interlink with it for some serious testing.

Almost my whole CD collection became victim of my listening mania.....
Its almost amazing to hear the enormous difference between my old CDP 591
(Sony) and the NAD 5440.
The music got so much more detail and realism and still sounded open and 
clear

Most Japanese players like the CDP 591 give the S tone a sharp edge, this
is very annoying.
The NAD however had none of these problems and sounded like it should.
A friend that came over that evening heard it immediatly and was also very
impressed by the NAD.
I knew that these cheap Japanese players where not that good but I was really 
amazed when I heard the real difference.
The sound got so much more realism that even a child could hear it !

Many people underestimate the importance of good interlinks and speakercables
and often use the standard interlinks.
The Interlink 400 that I used for the test was a good example.
When I connected the cable between the player and the amplifier, I got even
better results.
Especially in the lower frequencies was more detail then before, giving a deep
powerful bass.


===== KNOBS, SWITCHES AND BUTTONS ===========================================

Only the most important controls are on this CD-Player because its a fact
that a lot of gadgets have a negative influence on music.
Just like al the other CD-Players it is equipt with al the standard features
like play/stop, program, skip track and eject buttons.

But there is one feature that you won't find on another brand CD-Player and
that's the CDR button.
This circuit reduces the dynamic range, this is very handy when you are 
listening in the evening or record tapes for your car-system.
You can switch on the circuit if you don't want to disturb the neighbours.  
CDR is another good NAD invention !

With the CD-Player is also a remote control (who can live without them these
days) with all the functions on it.
You can control the volume with it, quite handy if your don't want to run
between your lazy chair and the amplifier.
All of the functions are on it that also can be found on the player itself.
The device has also a digital output (nice for DAT recorders and PCM devices).

===== CONCLUSION =============================================================

Funny thing is that just read the Hi-Fi corner in the previous issue of our
magazine and found some remarks I made in it.
I said that I would save my money for a SVGA monitor and wouldn't spend
more money on my stereo equipment.
Hum hum, yeah but that was 8 months ago.......

On with the conclusion about the NAD 5440,

Its an extremly good CD-Player that is certainly worth the price.
The controls are simple and easy to use on the player itself and with the
remote control.

The sound quality has to be heard to be believed.
Much detail and realism combined with an open and clear sound makes this
player the best in its class.
The stereo is very well balanced and good.
I want to state that a good interlink is a must with a player in this class.

Some points of criticism is the fact that the digits on the display could
be a bit bigger.
The player is also very sensitive and sometimes "jumps" a bit but I think
that a tune up will do miracles.
Its never good to carry such a device around the house and from the house
to the shop.

The NAD 5440 is still in production, you can also buy the NAD 5000 monitor
CD-Player as it has the same specs.
