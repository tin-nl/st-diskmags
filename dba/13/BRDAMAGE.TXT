                        BRAINDAMAGE by AGGRESSION
                        -------------------------

The Finnish democrew Aggression strikes  back  with  a brand new demo,
which comes on two disks. Aggression  is  now THE democrew in Finland,
thanks to their previous demo,  OVERDOSE.  But what kind of production
we got this time?

Well, after the first disk is loaded,  machine asks you to insert disk
#2. After rendering you got the introduction... WOW! Some nice effects
and great graphics! This kind of  introduction  has never been on STE.
Just like the best demos on  Amiga  (we  all must admit, that demos on
Amiga has always got STYLE)...

After introduction we have to load  again.  Now there is... No! I'm so
tired that I don't tell you all  the details about this demo. The most
of the effects consists of filled vectors and dots. And they are fast!
I think that I've  never  seen  such  vectors  on  ST/E.  If you don't
believe me, look at it yourself.

The graphics is also very  good.  There  are some specially well drawn
pictures, and no bad stuff at  all!  Visually  this is one of the best
(if not the best?) demos on STE. Music  is made out of samples, and it
fits the demo very well.

I forgot to mention, that this demo is a co-operation between KRUZ and
AGGRESSION. The most of the stuff  is  made by AGGRESSION, but 7th Son
of Kruz has helped them to code some parts.
