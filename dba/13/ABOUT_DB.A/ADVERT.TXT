FALCON SOFTWARE

FLOPPYSHOP  were  the  first  PD library to  support  the 
Falcon  and probably have the largest collection of Falcon 
PD and Shareware in the world.  The  catalogue is on disk 
and you can have a free copy if  you send  us a blank disk 
(remember to tell us it's for  the  Falcon).  We also swap 
Falcon software with lots of contacts worldwide,  so if you 
collect  PD and Shareware,  put your list on disk and we 
will  return your disk with a copy of our catalogue. If you 
write your own software we'll swap extra disks for your 
original work, but please note that we only accept the best 
programs. We look forward to hearing from you. 

ST SOFTWARE

FLOPPYSHOP  also have one of the best selections of PD  and 
Shareware for the ST/E.  In fact the catalogue is so big it 
comes on two  disks! Same  goes  for swaps and original 
software as with  Falcon  software. Send us two blank disks 
and ask for an ST catalogue.  You will not  be 
disappointed.
