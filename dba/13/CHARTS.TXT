The Falcon platform is not exactly a successful breeding place for commercial
programmes. We all know the reasons for this and so we're left to the mercy
of a few willing softwarehouses. Some of them do a gesture by shuffling us a
cheap conversion from the P.C. through our troths, while others seems to be
more willing to do a better job. The latter ones must be fully supported in
any way we can. I think that the above described situation applies very much
to the games reviewed here ...  


==================         ~FALCON.BLK~
ROBINSON'S REQUIEM 
==================
    

INTRODUCTION
------------

Some new games have appeared on the Falcon horizon. I've encountered a game
called Moonspeeder and this game, an adventure. This adventure called
'Robinson's Requiem' is converted, straight from the P.C. ! Falcon owners
must be getting sick and tired of all those adventures, at least I would kill
for a decent shoot-em up ! After the Ishar series and that train game
(something with Transartica)I started to wonder if there was more in life
than adventures ... Yes, even more adventures !


R.Q. is a based on the Dragons and Dungeons games where you run around in a
virtual reality world filled with puzzles and monsters. You can fight these
monsters with all kinds of weapons and sometimes even magic spells. These
games know a vast amount of fanatics all over the globe. The only known
difference with this game is, that it features just one character against the
usual four characters with Dungeons & Dragons. I didn't got far enough in the
game to see if there is also magic involved.

The main-menu

The main-menu contains several options to control the game. Things like
screen size and detail can be changed to adapt to a fast or slow computer.
Nice detail about all this, is that Falcons with hardware accelerators get
supported, and that's no luxury !


FIRST IMPRESSION
----------------

The introduction to R.Q. is a rather nice animated sequence of a spaceship
crashing into to the surface of a planet. Our hero Robinson bails out in the
nick of time with his parachute. 
I also saw the original game on the P.C. including the animation. That
animation is screen filling in comparison to the one on the Falcon, who only
takes a small part on the tube. Anyway, after the crash you find yourself in
a landscape occupied with palm-trees and baddies. It all looks very nice and
exciting at first glance ...


FIRST IMPRESSIONS CAN BE DECEIVING
----------------------------------

Nice surroundings, so lets explore it a bit. You can control our hero with
both the mouse and keyboard, and so off we go ... 
Instead of a smooth and speedy take off, the opposite seems to be the case !
Our hero seems cripple or old, because he moves no faster than your average
snail, with a 200 kilo block of concrete attached to its tail. To put it
simple, this game is Slooowww ... Don't forget to take in account that I used
my 32 MHz. accelerator too ! 
It was a lot faster on the P.C. but I seem to recall that the detail was
lower, either that or the graphics where a bit different in high detail mode.
As for the music effects they are virtually the same on both systems, they
range from the birds whistling, to the sound of water(falls). Very atmosphe-
ric and fitting for an adventure style of game like this one.
 

FOOLING AROUND
--------------

I have run around a bit and explored some of the surrounding areas. There
was only one character running around in the near vicinity. I had some sort
of dialog with this character and it behaved rather hostile. The second time
around I decided to kill it, and rob the body from its precious items. After
walking around for quite some minutes, I've stumbled upon a cave but it
contained nothing really interesting. 

After some more 'exploring' I got frustrated by the lack of action and the
slow and jerky movement of my hero. Maybe I'm not the right person to play
such a game and I had missed without doubt several clues that could turn this
game into an inferno of violence and mayhem ! 

CONCLUSION
----------

This is a straight forward conversion from the P.C., no specific Falcon
features are used in any way. It could be much faster and the intro could be
done fullscreen. It looks like a fast and easy job to me and it shows.
Although the concept is very good, the speed of the game is far below par
even on upgraded Falcons. You can speed up the game but it will cost you
dearly in graphics and screen size ! Further I would like to mention the lack
of action, it seems you have to go through great length to get some ...

It needs a pretty fanatic adventure freak to see this through !


CODE    : 6  (No use of DSP for faster performances).
GRAPHICS: 8- (They are rather nice but are not properly supported by code). 
SOUND   : 8  (Atmospheric sounds of waterfalls, birds and stuff).
GAMEPLAY: 6- (Much to sloooowww)

OVERALL : 6  (For doing a lousy job converting this game, I hate it when my   
              Falcon runs slower than your average P.C. !)

=================          ~FALCON.BLK~
MOONSPEEDER demo
=================


INTRODUCTION
------------

I mentioned in the previous review that there was another game on the lose. A
very promising preview of a forthcoming game. Unlike many other previews this
one is playable. You all know that I'm quite sceptical, especially about
promises for new Falcon games, as many never see the light of day. 
This review is rather short as my copy of this game mysteriously committed
suicide. You have to do with the impressions that are left behind in my
chaotic brain ...  

Moonspeeder is all about 3D spacecrafts, racing on a futuristic circuit on
some weird planet. You can choose between several spacecrafts, all of them
with their own specific characteristics and features. I didn't really get the
chance to test and play this game thoroughly but, what I saw was quite nice.

HERE WE GO THEN
---------------

I'm still a bit confused about whether this is the (promised) Black Scorpions
Moonspeeder or something from another company. Lets be honest, do we really
care !? What I saw was a both fast and slick game that made quite an impres-
sion. Finally something with action and racing, instead of chasing strange
creatures on some god for saking planet.
The graphics look okay and the soundeffects are very appropriate, and so is
the module sound. 

The goal of this game is to finish before the competition does. You may smash
into the competing spacecrafts in order obtain your goal. It's still a
preview version but it looks already great ! It takes some skill to maneuver
the ship safely through the playfield. So come on dudes finish this game and
let me at it ...

CONCLUSION
----------  

Just what we needed, something that's both fast and smooth and contains
action. Accelerators will be supported (at least in the commercial relea-
se)and that's is a very positive thing. Most new Falcons are getting sold
with 32 MHz accelerators already build in. Without proper DSP support the 16
MHz. machines are just to slow for some games. This game however is reasona-
bly fast on a standard 16 MHz. Falcon. Of course, good code is also of vital
importance for faster performance; sometimes it's the one thing that many
games lack (see previous review) ! 

Now the impatienced waiting for the commercial release begins ... 


CODE    : 8- (Maybe there will be improvements in the final release).
GRAPHICS: 7+ (Idem). 
SOUND   : 8  
GAMEPLAY: 7+ (Needs some additional features to make it even more appealing).

OVERALL : 8- (The concept is excellent !)
