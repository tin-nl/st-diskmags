This is already the second part of "Back in Time" series about the
history of computing. It goes mainly about the 8 bit days when Atari,
Commodore, Sinclair and others were extremely popular. It was also the
time that Philips, the well-known Dutch electronics manufacturer took the
first feeble steps on the computer path.

About 10 years ago, Philips introduced the "P2000T" computer. A rather big
device (in comparison to an Atari XL)with a build in micro cassette mecha-
nism. Philips wanted also a piece of the market by introducing an 8 bits
home computer. In spite of it's size the "P2000T" didn't came close to the
performance of the American machines. Although there were several user-
groups (mostly in the Netherlands) it never became the success that the
company had hoped for. Philips also provided bigger systems for companies
of the same 2000 series. The bigger systems were 'promoted' by the Dutch
government and many Dutch companies bought them. The P2000T home computer
got dumped on many schools (poor souls)for educational purposes.

Time passes quickly, we all know that and computers and their software die
of old age within a few years. This became quite clear when my mate got an
'old' Apricot computer. The thing doesn't work without system software
loaded of a disk, guess what he has no system disk ! The Apricot is now a
piece of worthless junk. Once this computer was considered to be top
technology! Needless to say that today's technology will be serious
outdated over just 2/3 years.

Incredible that all that software, thousands of programs seem the vanish
from the earth without a trace. Programs that people worked on for someti-
mes months or even years get erased. These programs found their way all
over the world through a network of swappers. I still have tapes of old
Atari XL games lying around knowing that I probably never can play them
again. 

Talking about old Atari 8 bit programs, I got another part of that list for
you. I hope that you can remember some of them as it's already several
years ago that they got released :

It would be fun if somebody converted a game like "Electra", it was
certainly one of the best games on the XL. Great sound, graphics and it
had speed. Chimera was also one of those games that really showed the
capabilities of the XL. I really had some fun in those days as everything
was new and exciting. We are spoiled now with all these images created by
super computers on the T.V. ! Our own 'personal computers' can create
raytraced pictures or run near Virtual Reality games. Everybody knows about
computers these days and almost everybody owns one. Dude's with baseball
caps who seem to drain their intelligence through the headphones of
their walkmans, start to infect the computer world more and more. Then
there are the Nintendo kids who grow mature and also buy their first real
computer !

After this observation we can draw only one conclusion:  We're doomed (Evil
Unleashed) ! May God stand with us ...
