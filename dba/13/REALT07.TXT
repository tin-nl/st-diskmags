FRIED BITS 3 REAL-TIME P7
~DUST.FIL~


02:36 <Genie!> Hello, I'd like to answer that last point- Pink Floyd was 
      probably the best of the music coming from that crew's CD as the rest was 
      either really crappy rock 'n' roll, mind-numbingly boring New Age muzak, 
      or cliched choices of classic music if you were lucky!

02:43 i think almost everyone is going downstairs to watch the demo
      and i am the lost one up here???? naaaahhh, there are a few ones left, #
      but i'll go down now, too... i mean, i'm gonna fuck myself up and stuff
      you know? or has someone seen mz greengrass??? think you've burnt it!
      Righty, think i'm outtie (4 now...).  =-) SkiD (-=

03:33 Just seen the New Lazer Demo, wow they know how to design a demo, (but
      they are in the lucky position to have Martina. We will have to wait
      20 minutes again for the Eko demo but that's life. Have to work on
      tuesday at 8:30 but haven't had any sleep (4 hours or so). I'm surrounded
      by Idiots (B.A.T & Bonus & Mantra). Signing off Wingleader/Synergy.

03:53 Ehm, yez! This was it, Demo compo over. i'm over as well. but can't 
      go home. someone in the back sais, that eko sucks, i don't know what
      he means... think eko is not bad at all... bye 4 now! =-) SkiD (-=

03:58 Hiya people, Havoc on the keys.. Just made sure the realtime article will 
      keep on running... Slimer's here too (boooring), oh no, he has just left 
      (let's start the party...)   What about the results of the compo's? Well, 
      as far as my entry is concerned, I don't guess I'll win lotsa money. Why, 
      you may ask... Well, the truth is that most of the boneheads out here 
      don't like corpse grinding GABBER HARDCORE enuff to give lotsa points... 
      But I don't care coz I make whatever I like to make. I'm gonna keep up 
      doing my own thing.    By the way, have you ever heard of the final 
      revenge by the Dutch demo scene, planned some fifteen minutes ago? The 
      plan will probably be abandoned within fifteen minutes as well... So much 
      talent, so little productivity, a real waste (ahhh ohhh, Death March thru 
      the speakers...)       About the democompetition now... I think Lazer was 
      the best, but I wanna see it run on a normal RGB monitor and not on a 
      467345 inch videowall. A good second best in my opinion was EKO, who had 
      more polygons in their demo than I have hairs on my head (quite a lot 
      indeed...). Third in line was Avena, I can only remember it was quite 
      good, but don't expect any details from a drunk degenerate like me... 
      Slima, give your comment:

04:12 Yep, I fully agree with Havoc, I want to see both demo's of Lazer and EKO 
      run on a normal RGB monitor before I make a judgement ! Anyway I was 
      impressed by the original design and effects of the Lazer demo. For once 
      I didn't see those blasted tunnels, Fractals, colorshocks and that was 
      very refreshing ! E.K.O. showed a really impressive 3D virtual world 
      which was also quite stunning ... Can't wait to see the final result !

      Hastalafietsbel,

      ZZZZSsssssllllimer............

04:24 Havoc back again... Quote of the day (just sprang into my mind):
      Real ASCII-art is a good book.

      But well, I don't read books, and I hate ASCII-art. So what's the point 
      in this altogether? Okey, still working on the final revenge of the Dutch 
      scene (never ever say that we are only some stupid beerdrinking 
      shitheads). The revenge is imminent. We will surprise you by finally 
      producing something worthwile. But don't count on it. Murder is a strange 
      thing, you'll never know when it happened to ya.

04:35  AVENA RULEZ !!!!

04:36 Think i've just had an LSD trip, saw some psychdelic animation video
      downstairs in the presentation room, goddammn it!! ...off. skid.

14:38 I saw too some wired animations in the room huhuhuhu cool an i!am very
      tired ahhhhhhhhhhhhh !!! Br3aK !

4:41  Ey Achtung, Guten Morgen !!!!

4:47 when is ze auszaehlung ??

4:>47  Hi erst einmal ein paar worte ueber bananen .
      bananen sind gelb und nicht sehr schwer weil sie nicht 
      hugo heissen und immer auf dem kopf stehen .
      ach ja der frosch will ein fahrrad zum geburtstag haben
      und fordert die freilassung aller ueberfluessigen 
      gross,klein,rund,kariert,halbvollen erdferkel.
      und der herzbube ist manchmal ein pfennig.


05:11 oh yeah, Havoc's back... This time I've got even less to say than usual. 
      So let's go craptalking. (New verbs are invented every second...). What I 
      do not understand with my small, small brain is why people decide to go 
      home at 5 o'clock in the morning... Ah well, who cares. It seems to be a 
      fact that Slimer is sleeping by now, and that's a very good reason to 
      stay awake, be sure of that. What has happened to our friend, the 
      chainsaw imitator? He hasn't pissed in his own sleepingbag, otherwise he 
      wouldn't have been here anymore (phone his mommy if he wants to go home). 
      But I cannot grasp why he didn't notice the pan of warm water some people 
      (hint,hint, it wasn't me, but , welll , ) had put his hands into... I 
      really cannot write anything with so many people 'round me, it's not 
      becoz of them, but becoz of me, I just cannot stand the pressure they 
      inflict 'pon me. How large is dis text? Let's have a look... * <-104974 
      bytes mark reached (gee wizz...) What do you care? The mag is now over a 
      meg long, as far as I know, and it's bound to get bigger in the next two 
      weeks. By saying 'one meg' I mean one full megabyte of plain ASCII text. 
      That's quite a lot. Equals to about 650 A4 pages. That's more than I've 
      ever read in my whole life. The Beck's is still good to me, although I 
      can feel a serious headache comin' up. The motivation to sleep is far 
      away, I guess I'll smoke some more... Dying is something you can't avoid 
      anyway. Havoc goes into mute mode. Bye.

05:25 Yeah! Stardust rulez!!! Achso..... Undercover rollt auch noch hier rum!
      Wird hoffentlich (!!!!) heute noch released!

05:40 Wo bleibt die Siegerehrung.... gaehn!

05:45 Ja wo bleibt sie denn!?!?!?!?!

05:47 Actually, almost all people seem to get quite tired and start to sleep a 
      bit ...
      Most of them upon a set of chairs right within the fresh aired main room. 
      Well, they will notice what good *that* was when they'll wake up in some 
      hours ;-)=
      I think it'll be interesting to watch them trying to get up and try to to 
      stay awake at the honoration of the best codings, grafx and musax (Hi 
      Drax, have you been here too?).

06:00 Nu` isses schon Lechz Uhr und noch immer keine Ziegeraehrunk!

10:09 Why are so much people pissed off because they slept just so few hours
      (ja, ich kann english ;-) 'glernt is hald 'glernt') I feel good without
      sleep, so who cares ? (hehehe, that was just a lie ;-)))

10:11 "Ich bin Monika Ehrlichmann und versteh garnix ausser doof!"

10:12 tjo denn, dann werd ich ma ein bischen und vielleicht auch eventuell
      unter Umstaenden etwas wenig und gruen.

10:15 Da sieht man mal, was dabei rauskommt wenn die Demos, die bei der
      Compo praesentiert werden, nicht kopiert werden duerfen. Ich habe
      mir noch nie so viele "ungezogene" Bilder kopiert wie heute :) ZoNk!

10:17 Zonk ist halt doch ein notgeiler Bock. Er hat uns alle nur verfuehrt.

10:17 Und wer kopiert sich den ganzen Kram fuer wen, weil zu faul ist?? Ja, ja
      das sind die schlimmsten die nix zugeben koennen...! Gell Blubb?


10:20 Oh my god! Ich bin so verdammt muede, das es reicht! Ab Freitag morgen

      das antue, aber irgendwie brauch` ich das. Wenigstens einmal im Jahr. Zur 
      Fried Bits. See ya!

10:48 Geez,this is GizMo again..Our little Party Demo on the Archimedes isn`t
      finished yet...(Damn!! Only the EndPart is missing(The one with all the
      the Crediz,..) 
      The Party has almost reached it`s End,and NoOne is sittin` in Front
      of a Computer Anymore,except me (Not really,there are some Guys left
      but they are REAL hardcore.)
      Just in the Moment we had a "Toothbrush in Diskdrive Error" made By Skid
      ...well his teeth are clean now,but the drive isn`t looking good anymore!

      Jezzz,...Mcfly had no Towel,so he Had to use about 200 Handkerchiefs to
      dry himself after a revivialing shower,..Well eh no,..i lend him a
      Towel,but that version`s not so Funny......
      Skid put a Joystick with  some self-sucking-Buttons to the wall,jezzz 
      Quite a few minutes ago..and it didn`t went his went down the wall 
      till now...thats Cooooooooool...!!:-))

11:34 New start, because the old file is corrupted....

11:35 Reservoir Gods are about to fuck off...bye!

11:41 Somebody has fucked up the realtime article. I'm going to see if
      I can save some of it. (O.T.M.)

11:43 Ciao, wir fahren! -jMS

 
11:48 Hey! Cool! Beinahe waere hier dieser Text gecrasht! Das haette
      bestimmt ein Riesenfiasko gegeben. ZoNk

11:54 yeah ! und das waer dann noch meine Schuld gewesen,..naja.mit meine
      Schuld...dennoch wir wissen nicht wie das passieren konnte,denn alles
      was versucht wurde,war den Text auf disk zu haun,.doch der doofe Ste
      hat dabei alle Linefeeds und returns gekillt,sodass alles in einer#
      Zeile stand..auf Platte wie auf disk.! die Jungs von DBA ham fast ne
      Herzattacke bekomm..doch denn kam ein PCler (Ausgerechnet) und hat 
      den Text und Mithilfe von WINword (Himmel hilf) wieder zusammmenge-
      flickt,.jepp..und so gehts weiter hier...

      Sorry nochmal....GiZmo.


12:12 Someone fucked up this text file in the past 20 minutes, and it's only
      back on-line now. Maybe the person who downloaded the text onto their
      disk????

12.13 Hope to meet you all at Saturn, Oktober. It was a nice party bye.

12:18 Slimer on the keys, Well we're back on line. This real-time article will
      be placed in D.B.A. diskmag 12. The issue is PD, so why bother with the
      copies if you can get it for free !? So, don't make copies of this article
      just get the mag.

12:25 But at least, I've my dotjes-routines working after 2 days hard work.
      Well, it went like this in short. I HAD to make an intro for our
      soon released game (within two weeks) called stacks (a tetris look-
      a-like). So with the mortal, soory, mental support of Slimer I coded
      YES! (zeeegel) the routine in just two days... Hmmm.. 20 pixels.
      Not great eh? But Giants are still alive, but no one can stay on
      this level (what level? what reputation?) for so long.
      Well, I quit now because I've to leave this party. Corsair/Giants

12:28 hey SLimer at 12:18 ! It was me ! I was the One who tried to Copy
      the Text and Crashed it by trying.We reconstructed the file and
      put it back,so there is nothing lost..
      the reason why i did it was that i have an Archimedes --> unable 
      to load your Diskmag,,..in case of,if i can get it..

      sorry,again...GiZmo (Leaving this Cool Party..by Car (Har Har),)
      P.s. It`s raining outside ! 

12:33 Alright, Skid once AGAin, and it's the last time, i promise! (you bet!)
      Juss as Giz i'm goin to leave this by car, i think that's kinda 
      comfortable... sorry for those who have to walk... har har...
      So, goodbye to everybody, this party was gRrRrRrrRReeeeEEEEaaaatttt!!!
      and i didn't even sleep too much... okay, and signing off:
                          =-) SkiD (-=  <- nOt AGAin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      p.s.: hihi... no p.s. .............................................



that's all folks      french are leaving germany and take their mother on mpeg
                      mhydroxid (artoax)

12:40 all the remaining french guys are leaving. But before we're out of sound
      we just want to thank you all for this nice party.

12:41 Well, NoCrew is leaving so soon we'll be the only swedish guys left
      here. Our (DHS) train leaves from Bremen HBF at 02:00 so we have a lot
      of hours to spend in the town. Argh! 13:30 hours left!

         -=* Loke / DHS *=-
12:48 I think I'll just sum up some impressions I have had during this party
      I thought that I had seen some very disgusting stuff in my life, but
      NoCrew really did it! How do you like eating cereal with coke?
      Or cereal with beer? Or raspberry cream with meatballs and coke?
      All mixed in a bowl of course. Yech!

      I'll be back soon to write some more.

          -=* Loke / DHS *=-

13:00 Short and only note before I move off the party:
      I guess, Lazer has hereby set the graphics and the design standart
      for demos for the next years. I'm really puzzeled. Well done,
      guys.                   FXL of TNB. P.S. See ya next time.
