A new realtime videodigitizer for the Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon
The Matdigi is a group of videodigitizers boards. They were specially 
made for the ROM port and optional as a Treu Color Grafixcart TC1208 
and TC1006. All digitizer digitisch in realtime a full videopicture in 
the best reachable quality and resolution.

The speed of which the digitizer does his work depends on things like 
picture/image size, number of colors, digitizer base (ROM port or TC 
cart) and ofcourse type of computer.

Three different kind ( exp. camera, recorder, TV ) of input sources 
can be used together and be switched by software.

Technical Details:

The MatGraph TC1208/1006

The MatDigi 1

Connection         : Option for TC1208/1006
Input              : 3 videosources switch-able through software
Video standard     : PAL, NTSC, SECAM
Video Signal type  : BAS, VHS, S-VHS
Resolution         : 768x576
Memory             : 1 Mb
Digitizing speed   : Realtime
Digitizing format  : YC 4:2:2
Number of colors   : 16,7 Milion (24 Bit) through software color
                     converter.
Presentation speed :

- 16,7 Mil. colors                     +/-  0,3 fullpicture/sec
- Faster greymode (256)                +/-  3   fullpicture/sec
- Smaller picture 384x288 (256 grey's) +/- 12   fullpicture/sec
  (read lesser resolution)

Because of the fast grey mode with lesser resolution you can follow 
the movement of an objekt almost in realtime. 

Special ROM port version for the Atari.

MatDigiR1

Without the use of the TC graphiccart in the ROM port you are limited 
to digitize video images only. This because of the fact that HiRes 
graphics without the TC cart aren't possible, the MatDigiR1 will be 
used without pallette,- and graphic output. The technical data however 
is the same as the MatDigi1 and TC1208/1006. Again the resolution, 
speed and colors are restricted to the kind of computer that is used. 
Every resolution from the Atari ST mono till the Falcon Treu Color is 
supported. The MatDigiR1 is already uptimized for the 16 bit mode of 
the Falcon, so there will be a very good quality picture with an 
resonable speed possible. 

Software for the MatDigi1 and MatDigiR1

For the use of these carts there are three software tools available.
An accessory for digitizing and showing a video image in different 
kind of applications.
A videoprogram that gives you the control over the video functions and 
parameters.
With the help of an import module you can port pictures right into a 
Calamus DTP document.

What do you get...

The software tools and a S-VHS cable with mini DIN plugs, and a VHS 
Adaptor with normal plug is the standard package. An optional video 
cable with 3 x mini DIN plugs and a VHS adaptor will make it possible 
to cinnect 3 devices at the same time. 

Advantage of Digitizing.

- The resolution is independent of the size of the object.
- 3D objects can be digitized.
- No hazzards like developing the film or thing like that.
- Good quality with small objects (5 Cm) 
- Digitizing is faster that scanning and no 2D limitation.
- Highspeed shot can be made. Shuttertime of 1/10.000 sec.
