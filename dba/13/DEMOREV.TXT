INTRODUCTION

Here I sit fully stuffed, after consuming some very spicy food. I love spicy 
food but I cannot stand eating it. Drops of sweat rolled down my cheeks and 
nose, and my throat felt like it was on fire ... Well at least my cold is 
gone, the bacteria must have died an awful dead in a pool of peppers (talkin'
about hell). A radical cure, probably coz' I am also a radical dude.


D.B.A. diskmag is regarded as the diskmagazine aimed at the democoders. This is
not entirely true but nonetheless we have the tendency to do many demoreviews 
give coding tips and so on. Anyway people do expect to see a fresh batch of 
reviews, so I won't disappoint them ... We start with a review of the latest 
dentro by the Megabusters. This group has their home base in France from where 
they spread their new products over the globe. Lets see what's up ...  


REVIEW

As the title already gave away, the dentro in this review is called 
'Lamerbrain'. It starts off with a picture of a skull while a module tune kicks 
in. The skull goes and the title of the demo drops in. After these standard 
demo procedures, the first effect comes up. It is an old-fashioned starfield in 
which dot characters zoom out, the characters form a word.

---
Interlude, a word from our sponsors:

Why do all these reviews look alike? 
---

Wow, now what, the spicy food seems to make me musty (yawn). This is gone be a 
long review. Now were was I, after the hyperwarp through space it is time for 
the next part. Before we come to that, there is a picture first with some 
greetings on it. Next thing up are unlimited bobs, an old and boring effect.
They say they meant it for a megademo on the ST, but even then it would be 
boring. 
The effect goes and Fractals appear, they slowly fill the screen. I instantly 
flick the switch of my 32 MHZ. accelerator and the process gets doubled.
Now I know why I am so sleepy, it is not the spicy food I ate (yawn) ...


An old-fashioned dottunnel appears, it twists' over the screen like a snake in 
heat. After the twist it is time for another pic. The next effect are keftales. 
It is that mosaic effect that I thought I would never see again, false hope. 
Several little pics zoom in and fill the entire screen, the first thing that 
crossed my mind was 'God not another Termfin clone, please'. My prayers were 
heard and after the screen got filled with pics it just got replaced by more 
Fractals(shock!)


The Fractals finally go and the next picture appears, it is a nice menga(or 
manga, whatever)pic. of a girl. Next to the girl are the credits. If that 
wasn't enough, yet another picture makes its entrance. It shows the 
Megabusters logo and it slowly fades away leaving you where you was before 
you started this dentro, in the desktop! Strangely constructed sentence 
but I guess you must be used to that by now ...

CONCLUSION


This is not the kind of demo I would picture running on a Falcon, as a matter a 
fact this could be done on a ST. The effects are boring and old-fashioned and 
are average executed. This is definitely one of the lesser productions of the 
Megabusters and I hope they do not do this again. I am already wondering why I 
did this demoreview in the first place. Well, here come the ratings for what it 
is worth,

CODE     : 6+
GRAPHICS : 7- (For being 16 colors)
MUSIC    : 7  (An okay module, not much the screw up on)

OVERALL  : 7-

INTRODUCTION

The U.K. was once an important export country of quality Atari software. Groups 
like 'The Lost Boys' and 'The Pixel Twins' were big names within the Atari 
community. Well times change rapidly, the good old ST became obsolete and it's 
once mighty scene crumbled to pieces. Top demogroups joined softwarehouses and 
promised us software for the Falcon, only they came no farther than the 
previews. Some of them chose money over their old passion and sold out to the 
P.C.! No real top groups were left in the U.K. 


After some small signs of life, we can finally see an increase in productivity! 
Groups like the 'Reservoir Gods' are doing very useful work by coding games and 
other things. Now a new group joined the fun.  They call themselves 'Digital 
Chaos' and consist out of members from former democrews. They bring the first 
real British dentro with some really nice effects. Lets hope that this is the 
start of a British upraising. 

REVIEW

A dialog box appears after you boot up this dentro, it asks if want to continue 
or not. They give people the opportunity to bail out before the show starts, 
this could be interpreted as a lack of fate in their own capabilities or vice 
versa. Although the screen is still black, the module player already decided to 
unleash its tune upon the innocent computer-nerd in front of the screen. It is 
time to steam up his glasses ...


A red square appears in the middle of the screen with the name of the democrew 
in it. The square grows into an almost screen filling pattern of T.V. snow(in 
the same style as the end part of Warum). The title of this demo gets projected 
on it and than it all moves away. We immediately become part of some real-time 
Fractal zooming. It is nice, if it were not for the fact that it becomes boring 
after you have seen it thousands of times before. I remember having at least 
eight tiny demo's revolving around Fractals, not to mention those in most of 
the big dentro's. Anyway, the Fractals slide out of the screen and I am waiting 
for the next thing.


A dot orgy is next on the list. It starts as an ordinary dottunnel but 
transforms (literary)into a very impressive dotshow. The dots morph into all 
kinds of shapes with tremendous speed. It is the best demonstration of this 
effect that I have ever seen on the Falcon so far. What will be next? A steady 
blue plasma background acts as decoration for some Gouraud shaded objects. Both 
nice and colorful. This demo also contains a tunnel with squares known from 
several other demo's. The difference with this tunnel is the fact that the 
flight trough it is done sideways. A variation to an old idea. 


Fractals do seem to play a big part in this production, because more appear.
They are morphing within the boundaries of a square. Again here a variation
to a classic effect. The Fractals disappear and the vector lines around them
go in style. 
If you're familiar with most of the current demo's on the scene then 
you instantly will recognize the next part. It is the E.K.O. concept with the 
3D objects flowing trough each other. They start with Gouraud shaded objects 
ranging from cubes till balls. They conclude this session with shiny texture 
mapped objects. Those texture mapped objects look very spectacular and 
realistic.


We are nearing the end part of this demo, as the old module tune fades away. 
A new tune kicks in and a classic end part makes its entrance. Nothing fancy 
here just a grey screen with credits, greetings and other info scrolling
(vertically)by. 

CONCLUSION


The first real Falcon multi part dentro from British soil and a good one too.
Although the dentro is not a display of new and original effects is does 
contain some impressive stuff. Especially the dot-orgy is fast and surprising. 
The flowing 3D objects are nice although those of E.K.O. appear to be more 
'solid' in appearance. I have taken in consideration that they are Gouraud 
shaded or texture mapped. Those texture mapped objects at the end of the show 
are both realistic looking and colorful.

CODE     : 8- (esp. for the dot and texture mapped part).
GRAPHICS : 7+ (for the nice texture mapped cubes at the end).
SOUND    : 8- (Two very nice mods).

OVERALL  : 8- (The overall execution could be done better (i.e., lacks some    
               style).

Not bad for a first real attempt at a multi part dentro.

OBNOXIOUS DEMO BY INTER
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=


INTRODUCTION

Another production from the Independent demofactory in Germany. This time it is 
Inter's turn to harass the crowd with some demo fireworks. The demo is mainly 
a 68030 demonstration, the DSP is only used for the module music. It is a pity 
that most democrews only use it as some sort of advanced soundchip. On the 
other hand it takes quite some persistence and knowledge to use it for other 
purposes. I have been nosing through some DSP programming books and nearly died 
a heart-attack! Maybe if I grew long hair and wore glasses, I'd be intelligent 
enough to understand it all ...  


REVIEW

Lets get going cos' we have a long trail ahead. Obnoxious comes on two HD disks 
and must be installed on your Hard drive. Yeah another huge demo, so bye bye, 5 
megabytes of Hard drive space (Can't wait to receive the Lazer demo) ..


The show starts rather silently with an add, closely followed by a very old 
animation of the movie "Scanners." I remember seeing this animation on the 
good old ST somewhere.
Aaah, music kicks in and some presenting stuff gets presented(huh). Almost at 
the end of the presentation thingy there is ballfield (the counterpart of the 
starfield). The balls rotate a bit as the glide by on the screen. I hope that 
people don't start screaming at me if I say that this is a rather outdated 
Effect!? Exit balls, and in comes a vector mask of a human face, it also takes 
a ride across the screen ...


Till so far all the demo pieces fit nicely with the music, it is all precisely 
timed out! A pic. with a backside view on a woman, comes by on our way to the 
next effect. White breadth's(?) appear and start rotating at high speed, also 
not really original. In the famous tunnel series they now present us with the 
vector model. We may look at it from all sides and we're even allowed a ride 
through it! After the short and a bit boring journey we find ourselves looking 
at a blue spiral shaped object. It looks like a giant shaded bob in spiral form 
but the credits state that it are morphing dots! Anyway beside it being an old 
effect it does look nice!


What happened if you put of woman's face in a blender!? How should I know I 
never tried it (only on a cat). Anyway Inter allows you to virtually experience 
this exciting event from behind your computer. No bloodstains on your precious 
Falcon or cloths ! An okay effect. 
Yep, greetings time, the sight of a big fire plasma almost makes my smoke 
detector go haywire. Full of anticipation I wait for D.B.A. to come by, but no 
avail ...
Bad thoughts cross my mind, should I write a bad review about this demo!? Just 
kiddin', of course not (hum)! 
Why does this demo has to contain so many effects, is it to piss demo reviewers 
off !? Probably, because we are no way near the end yet!


As you might have noticed I am still a bit affected by the Fried Bits party 
virus and that of the common cold/flue. On with the show, rasters! Yes 
rasters(or bars whatever) rotate, bend and distort on screen. Yes, I am going 
to say it again, it is oLd (Thank god for Lazer and E.K.O.)! 
Next up is a 3D Wolfenstein clone that does not look like Wolfenstein at all 
but who noticed it anyway!? We take a swift journey through passage's of 
texture mapped walls including animated firewalls. Almost the same as the 
N.P.G. counterpart. There are now several of these demo's floating around when 
does someone morphs these things into a game!? It is rather embarrassing that 
the Falcon still does not have its own decent Doom clone!


A kaleidoscope alike effect invades the screen. Seen a thousand times before in 
an equal amount of demos', nothing really mind boggling! Two huge pics distort 
and flow through each other accompanied by a very nice module tune. Although 
many effects are rather boring, they do get accompanied by very pleasant module 
tunes! Time to go on a bit farther ...

A from Lazer copied 3D shaded multicolored ball is next and is bit improved. 


I am still missing one effect in this demo, eehhh, fractals? No, eehhh a 
multicolor effect?? Naaahh, yes I know, a good old tunnel! Oh look what is 
next, a tunnel! Yes, it is that Avena tunnel thing, this time a bit prettier 
and green ... 
Now, the next thing is a bit more original(on Falcon that is)it is a burning 
vector object! It transforms while it burns, rather nice! It burns out and 
gets replaced by a big pudding. A pudding in the shape of a big glassy globe of 
mother earth bounces by on screen. Yeah, I do not bother anymore, saying it is 
an old effect!


Stay tuned, because next up is a demonstration of 100 ways to distort your 
chessboard without having to buy a new one! You can shrink it, flip it and 
move it on the screen! When your done you just use it as underground for your 
new starfield effect. Those shadows look nice on the board!
Another Lazer copied effect called "Torus", it's a vector object spinning on 
the screen. This effect gets closely followed by three RGB balls locked up in a 
large vector ball. Well, you know how it goes when your fiddling around with 
RGB ... Yes, you take also three pics of a woman's head, one in green, red and 
blue, you make the three layers transparent and move them around the screen 
simultaneously! Before you know it, you have limited balls in lots of colors 
moving by! Those balls look nice but it is an old ... (sorry)!


You have to adjust your monitor to catch the next part, the only thing I can 
say about it, that it is blue! Something vertically was going up and something 
similar to face became visible. Well, we finally enter the credits screen of 
this lengthy production. A nice marble background pic. comes up, and a glassy 
sphere moves over it. The credits are shown with screen shots on a 'stone' 
plate, it flips whenever the screenshot changes! After the credits the whole 
thing bounces from the screen. 


After that the greetings appear again, complete with a soft module tune and a 
vertical scroller. Quite some text later, the endpic drops in. The pic. shows 
an Independent logo, after that plop desktop!


CONCLUSION

Most parts of this demo have their own soundtrack. The quality of the mods is 
excellent, making the music more important than the effects. Most effects are 
old fashioned which is a pity. I must say that the demo is very well timed(i.e.,
music and effects connect). The demo is also very lengthy.  It compresses a lot 
of effects in 4/5 megabytes of Hard drive space. Well. The figures say more 
then words sometimes do ... 


CODE     : 7+ (Mainly old effects, although they are very well in 'sync' with 
              the music).
GRAPHICS : 7  (There weren't that much graphics in this demo).
SOUND    : 9- (Many modules and pleasant ones too).

OVERALL  : 7+ (In spite of it's length and music it doesn't add anything new 
               to the demo world)   
  
Obnoxious looks/sounds like a module demo containing effects!
