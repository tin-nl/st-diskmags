D.B.A. DISKMAGAZINE 13 "THE COMPILATION"

Welcome to D.B.A. diskmagazine 13 "the compilation." It contains the "best"
articles from issue's 9 till 12. We decided to skip issue 13 as a precaution
because all D.B.A. members are quite superstitious. The next official D.B.A.
issue will therefore be number 14! Speaking about number 14, we could use
some contributions. So, don't be shy and send us some articles or graphics.

You may notice that the layout of some articles is a bit obscure. This relates 
to old formats we used in earlier issue's. I had no time nor motivation to
convert them all. Besides, it shows the evolution of D.B.A. diskmag over the 
last couple of issue's. 
Right now we are working hard to get number 14 ready although work and study
make things difficult.

Well, dump the old D.B.A. mags and replace it with this one. We'll save you a
couple of disks. You are of course entitled to keep all the old issue's for
sentimental reasons(Grin).
