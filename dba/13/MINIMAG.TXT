MINIMAG
~ATARI.FIL~
This is a special production for all those busy working housewives 
and amoebas whose busy,  busy working lives do not leave them time 
for  an  extended  'flop down in a chair and read'  of  a  regular 
diskmag.. Quite simply, this diskmag is in compressed or condensed 
form, to give those previously deprived readers a chance to sample 
what they have been missing up to now..

Without further ado, we proudly present..

EDITORIAL:-

Moan bah whine! If you don't write in for the next issue, we won't 
bother the next time..  Look, all it takes is a little bit of time 
and effort,  the odd word,  a couple of commas or full stops,  the 
odd  asterisk or pair of brackets..  A dedicated and  enthusiastic 
readership is what it is all about..

A  READER WRITES:- ((()))) Hope this helps,  best wishes with  the 
mag, Kev..

(Thanks mate,  see what we mean, we can use this in a future issue 
that is really short of brackets.. Get writing!)

  G A M E S   R E V I E W S:-

'UP YER BUM'..  A hilarious guide to sodomy through the ages, with 
lavishly illustrated and animated sequences..  Not so much a game, 
more of an immediate kicking in of your door by the people charged 
with upholding the Obscene Publications Act.. (PC CD-ROM)

'STRANGULATOR  4'..  The  much loved shoot em up makes an  overdue 
return   to  the  bargain  bins  of  the  local  software   store, 
approximately  eighteen months after it was first thrust  upon  an 
apathetic public.. (VIC 20 CD-ROM) 

'THE  MOONS OF CHRONIC'..  A huge amount of roleplaying  character 
creation,  and data construction detracts entirely from the rather 
limited  and  poorly  coded arcade action  sequences  buried  deep 
within the game.. (SPECSAVERS TX-3000 Series CD-ROM)

'SENSELESS SOCCER'..  The most reprehensive football fan simulator 
ever  to  be  created  for home  computers..  Choose  between  the 
football  hooligans  of several UK Premier  League,  and  European 
sides,  culminating  in  all  out combat at the World  Cup..  User 
definable  fan colours,  bloodstains,  special weapons and tactics 
options,  configurable  police  tear-gas response,  and much  much 
more!! (SEGA BURPO CD-ROM)

 D E M O   R E V I E W S :- 

'WE LIKE WAR DEMO' by Ribena.. (ATARI FALCON) A loud and digitised 
fart announces the start of this whirl through countless images of 
high  speed  death and destruction,  mostly copied from  fictional 
films of the same..  Almost identical to the earlier 'WE HATE WAR' 
demo,  but  with  the high-handed preachy textual bits left  out.. 
This made this demo more enjoyable than last time..

'RUBBISH DIGI-PIC AND BADLY LOOPED SAMPLE DEMO' (MATTEL  AQUARIUS)   
This  slipped off our hard drive by mistake,  don't let it get out 
any  further!  Please  erase the disk as soon as you see  it,  and 
forget  you  ever  saw it,  or saw our names  on  it!!  (ST-Format 
review,  "A perfectly humourous and well programmed little ditty - 
94%..")

 D I S K Z I N E S :-

'THE PURPLE BOX' - Several French demo crews come forward to  tell 
us  of the fascinating history of that purple box that appears  in 
the  bottom  right  hand corner of certain  demo  screens  by  the 
Hemoroids  and Holocaust,  to name but two..  They then attempt to 
justify this but fail horribly,  and the resulting trial and long, 
drawn-out  death sentences with digitised screams (STE  only)  are 
all faithfully recorded in this special one-off issue..

'ABUSE YOUR CAT' - An offbeat publication by several other  French 
demo crews who tell how to shout rude words at your cat, violently 
shake  the  litter tray whilst it is using it,  pull faces in  its 
general  direction,  and  scream in an exasperated  fashion,  when 
after all of that, it walks off showing its bottom to your face by 
way of a silent rude gesture in return.. 

 U T I L I T I E S :-

'PIECE OF STRING' - It's long,  twiddly,  ill-defined,  and can be 
used  for literally hundreds of things,  from tying up a bundle of 
disks,  to tying-off the end of your leg to stop a severed femoral 
artery bleeding you to death! This is SHAREWARE, and any satisfied 
users,  should  send $15.00 or three Chocolate Orange bars to  the 
authors TIEAKNOTINIT DEVELOPMENTS (Address given in .doc file)..

'A HOUSE' - Perhaps the ultimate utility,  where a house keeps you 
warm at night,  and your disk collection safe during the day.. The 
very high start-up cost and monthly shareware fee, otherwise known 
as 'rent' or 'mortgage' tend to mitigate against its  popularity.. 
Also the extreme lack of portability is leading the developers  of 
'House'  to  consider a cheaper and easier to  carry  alternative 
provisionally  called  'Tent'..  More  news on this  exciting  new 
development, hopefully by next issue..     

 E D U C A T I O N :-

'WE DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION!' - So said Pink Floyd,  in their 1979 
album,  'The Wall'.. It goes to show that Rock Bands talk, or sing 
utter  and  complete bollocks most of the  time,  because  without 
education,  just  how  were  they  going to learn  to  play  their 
guitars,  hassle  with the road crews about the massive stage  and 
lighting  rig,  argue  about  unfair clauses  in  their  recording 
contracts,  indeed,  learn  how to hold a wine glass the right way 
up??  If  we  took  their advice,  we would not be here  now,  but 
instead,  daubing finger paints in a crude and tribalistic fashion 
on the walls of the local 'special needs hospital'.. 

 P R O G R A M M I N G :-

'3-D STARFIELD SPRITE TUNNEL POLYGON RASTER ROUTINE' - Take 1 kilo 
of  sprites,  stir  in several polygons,  remembering to turn your 
oven  on to pre-heat it (150 deg Centigrade)..  Break the  rasters 
into  small  pieces,  adding them to the mixture  whilst  stirring 
gently  to  blend the ingredients together..  You may want to  put 
some MODfiles or egg-whites in a separate bowl, adding breadcrumbs 
to them  to improve the texture.. Combine everything together with 
three drops of vanilla essence.. Then pour the mixture into a long 
shaped loaf tin,  bake for forty minutes,  then turn the completed 
code out of the tin.. Sprinkle starfields on top to finish..

 I N T E R V I E W S :-

'EXCLUSIVE  INTERVIEW WITH JEFF MINTER' (Copied from  the  ST-News 
exclusive text!)

ST-News -  "Hello Jeff, are you there? hello.... Hello??"










 (End of interview)

 F I C T I O N :-  

'THE  STORY  OF  'O' - Once upon a time,  there were  a  flock  of 
diskzine  readers who expected to find a riveting and erotic  tale 
of a slave girl subjected to countless sado-maschochistic torments 
at  the  hands  of  a cruel  and  depraved  aristocratic  master.. 
Instead,  they get this load of piffle, which is about a letter of 
the alphabet somewhere between 'N' and 'P' who gets into a  couple 
of  very  predictable and somewhat  non-erotic  scrapes..  Bleakly 
contemplating  the  wasted purchase of  soft toilet  tissues,  the 
hordes of frustrated and disappointed readers set off on a rampage 
that  culminates in the destruction of New York by  fire,  looting 
and pillage..

 N E X T   I S S U E :-

Will  there  be one??  If we can get these @!*!KK!  padded jackets 
with no armholes off to be able to write it, then we will have for 
you!:-

'THE  GREAT  RUMPO'  -  The  game  everyone  is  talking   about.. 
Adventures of a lard ass in a land where bottoms are not allowed.. 
(PC CD-ROM)

'THE RETURN OF REALLY NEGATIVE EDITORIAL WRITING MAN!!' - Sort  of 
speaks for itself..

'INTERVIEW WITH QUENTIN TARANTINO' - The life and loves of one  of 
the most talented pieces of contemporary seaweed.. ('TARANTINO' is 
the editor's pet kelp!)

'MORE CULINARY PROGRAMMING TIPS' - DSP Souffle surprise and  those 
difficult transitions from oven to room temperatures.. 

'BILLY THE SQUID' - The first in a new series of Wild West stories 
with  a distinctive underwater flavour..  (To be printed under our 
new  paperback  'Sea-salt and Sixguns' label shortly,  you saw  it 
here first!!)

'THE  YOUNG JENNY AGUTTER NUDE,  LIKE IN THAT FILM WITH ABORIGINES 
WHEN  SHE WAS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN OR THEREABOUTS' - Another of  the 
editor's  more sordid fantasies getting out of hand and  into  the 
text, (frustrated whine) Damn, damn damn!!

 T H E   F A T   L A D Y   H A S   S U N G  :-

Pinched this one off 'Power Diskmag' - Tee hee!  Well the fat lady 
has  bellowed  forth  now,  and it is all over  bar  the  coroners 
report..

  This Drivel is (C) CIH - (Maggie bloke!) March '95..
