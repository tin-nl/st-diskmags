VIOLENCE...
~CROSS.FIL~
Violence...

It all started when two kids of 10 years     
old murdered a 2 years old baby  because 
they had seen a horror movie, the  whole  
world was upset.  And  nowadays,  people 
are  talking about violence in  computer 
games...

There  are  many violent  games  on  the 
market,  like:  Mortal Kombat,  Doom and     
many  others.  In those two  games,  you 
kill  your enemies  with  guns,  swords, 
flamethrowers, metalhats? and some other 
cruelties.  Some people think that those 
games should be censored with the result 
that Nintendo and Sega have changed  the 
blood  in Mortal Kombat into  sweat  and 
when you rip out a heart you take out  a 
wallet. They even wanted to take out the 
female fighters in Streetfighter 2...

But why was Doom on the PC popular? Yes! 
because  there was much violence in  the 
game  and what would happen when Sega  or   
Nintendo  would  release Doom  on  their 
machines? Yes! it would be censored...

But  why  isn't  Mario  censored?  Mario 
jumps  on  turtles,  that's  cruelty  to 
animals and that is allowed because it's 
not close to reality...

If  you look at all the games there  are 
you can only find a few without violence 
and people don't like censored games, so 
why  should you censor games  when  kids 
don't buy censored games?

I personally think that censoring  games    
is a  waste of  time and I am glad  that    
Atari  isn't  going  to do  that  on the    
Jaguar...
