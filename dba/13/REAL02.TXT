First we start with a list of people/groups who where on the party.
The names are not in alfabetic order because the list of names on my paper
is a bit confusing to read from.

Hemoroids       ( Aardschock )
Synergy         ( Arcade, B.A.T., Stash, Mandrome, Rapido, Wingleader, Chrome,
                  Scavenger and Zanac )
Sentry          ( Eagle, Mac, Iso, Ultimate and Toon )
D.B.A.          ( Bonus, O.T.M. and Slimer )
Hotline         ( Lowlife and Sledge )
Elite(endo)     ( Radium and Grimlock )
Galtan 6        ( CIA )
Synth Dream     ( Dr. B )
The Respectables( Tyrem )
TEX             ( Daryl )
SOD             ( Cthulu, Duke, Blasphemer and Ccomm ) 
Animal Mine     ( M.C. and Penguin )

The Joker

There where some other guys too, but i we have no names of them on the paper
list( someone of M.C.A., Stephan Posthuma and others ).
It could also be that some of the names are wrong ( hey i'm not perfect )!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20:35
        Sorry pals, english is the language atm. *grin*
        Dr.B has to leave this incredible awesome party for some
        dark reason, BUT don't despair, these aren't my last words.

        won't beat me up next time when I am around..

It's quiet at the moment in the "computerroom" of this building, most
of the guys are watching a movie in the other room.....
Slimer

21:30

Hi, ZX on keyboard !! Yeps, the lost Belgian man in Holland... So, 
all is quiet now  (we listen some tekkno during the party until my come 
back at the party !!  Now, before the original list, an importamt 
greetz to the Purple Day's coffee shop ! It's a real good one, near
of the Breda's station.  Hmmm, now the tekkno start again.....But no !
I think it's a demo running now, perhaps on Falcon !  So, be ready for
the real one, and original 'Jenevre Super Skunk party !'....a fast hello
to Tekkilla underground for the good step in decading life of a poor
coder unknowed of african-s- kangooroooooooo ....I put the 's' coz if
i've don't do it, a guy just a my right says: ' not -S- at Holland, 
but -S- at 'african' ..... ok, let's rulezzzzz
Zx




        

22:34

Hello, this is O.T.M. again, and the party is going well. There is not 
much happening at the moment, everybody is talking very loudly and they
just started some very noisy Music in the background.
But okay I won't bore you anymore with boring stories and let another bore/
entertain you!!!!

22:45

Hi there,Aardschock on the keys... Wayne's world - Wayne's world - Party
                                   Time - Excellent !!!

22:53

Chrome is typing some more shit for the real-time article. Don't have anything
else to do, so why not? Well those Belgians really know their quantities!
They're rolling joints 24 hours a day!?! They even drink Jenever with it.
Well their problem, Life's a bitch and then you die, usually!
   
22:55

Well some of the most boring guys of this boring party is now typing on this
'old' Stf'je (voor those other boring guys here in Nederland...)  I'm waiting
for the next movie to be shown on the big TV wich will be shown about 23:15 pm
The movie is braindead and if i go behind my st to code the intro you just
have seen, but the music in here is so loud!!!!  slimer is sitting next to me 
(not even 1 metre away from me) and i have to shout.. and still he can't hear
me!!!!!   what do yo shout????     ooh a type mistake...  
Fransje just went to the 'DJ' and told him to shut up with his fucking noise,
but the noise is still loud... It's now 23:00 and still the movie hasn't begon
yet (merdre!). Well so much from me Ultimate but here is otm to take it over 
from me:  (he's with D.B.A.  aaaarrrrggghhhhh let's get outa here!!!!!!)
Slimie has got something on contact-lenses, but who cares no one believes 
him. Another shitty thing about Slimer: Finally he has got a Falcon, Hard-
Disk in it, a monitor of K.G.E. (asm coder d.b.a). So you think he has
got it made, but there is no Devpac on the whole harddisk. <-------- That's
real f*** if you ask me. L A M E R !!!!! (<---- AND I REALLY MEAN IT SLIME!)
But I got to quit, because the main-movie BRAIN-DEAD is going to be shown
in a view moments.


O my God someone else wants to type some shit!!!

23:15
 
No, I don't want to type any shit, I just want to annoy Slimer. And the best 
way to do just that is to type something! Yeaahhh! You don't care about this, 
I don't care about this and I'm still puzzled about what I'm trying to say 
here. Probably some shit. Jess jess. (....) (...) Yazz yazz yes jez jawohl 
h**l h****r SS-R*tt*nf*hr*r nee dat wist ik wel, dat hoef je me niet te 
vertellen... crap.. let's try again more seriously...

23:25

New and improved!
Also available in Belgium!
Huggies Pull-ups!
Not funny at all!

23:27

Ugh ugh, people of the prairies, this is the Great Bison of the Apaches 
speaking. Uninvitedly I went to this party organised by some coward
white-skins. Methinks there's lotsa peace-pipe-smoking going on, but those
white-skins sure use quite different tobacco! Not many squaws arounds, but
maybe I'll have more luck in Breda's rent-a-squaw area (if the U.S. Cavalry
won't be there in time to bust Great Bison).
OOOOps, us got to go now someone has spotted the U.S. Cavalry, unexpected
but what the heck so where we.

00:40

Hello, these are Havoc and O.T.M. after seeing a quite disgusting part of the
main movie of tonight called "Braindead" we are back!!! My stomach just 
couldn't handle the pressure after the Mc Donalds, and the rest of the junk-
food. So after they showed an old woman eating her own ear up my 
stomach just went up side down and in side out. But now I let Havoc for a
while (He was to impressed of the movie too!!!) Yeah, I was impressed by it,
but mainly because of the low quality! Okey, so it was very utterly disgusting
but I reckon that films ought to have a good story-line too... (Jess jess I'm
a strange personality indeed). So now I'm back here in the computing barn of
this party typing in this realtime article (and, as you might have suspected,
being bored as hell). Here's OTM again... Wingleader is sitting besides me, 
and he thinks the movie is great, but he has seen it already. But this 
expleans a lot, He is a stupid brainless (braindead) monkey, And that is what 
the movie is all about. Well, something different now the conversation is 
now on the use of buying a Falcon. Conclusion there is no use for it, but
what the heck, it's Atari so it must be good. Havoc back again... Now--->
:Well, I think there is no reason at all for buying any computer, whether it
is an Falcon or any other calculator. Now let's change to another subject...
Let's think of something... For instance... The use of a diskmag... Naah, a
computer is useless so what use is a diskmag? Maybe keeping up the idea that 
the computer is useful after all? (Note from the author: this is getting 
BORING). Let's talk about Wingleader's sense of humour.





That was it. Let's continue with... The Return Of O.T.M.  4 .... 3 ....
2 .... 1 .... 0 .... We have (cut the crap...)
=>
        CLR.W   $FF8240.W       ; RASTA
        MOVE.W  #$25,-(SP)      ; OFFICIAL VSYNC

        ADDQ.L  #6,SP           ; CORRECT STACK
        MOVE.W  #$FFF,$FF8240.W ; RASTB

AND LOOK AT THE PROCESSOR-TIME THAT IS STILL LEFT, WITH ALL THAT PROCESSOR-
TIME WE COULD DO WONDERFULL STUFF, MODULES IN THE BACK-GROUND, FULL-SIZE
NUDE PICTURES OF KELLY BUNDY AT THE BACKGROUND.

O.k. let's cut the crap..... Oh no don't do that, coz than I could leave
right away so here's Havoc again with some marvellous typings!!!

Jess jess (<= my favourite beginning of an text which has no use at all).
Havoc again. Now I, the Mighty Sovereign of Darkness will speak upon my
humble servants. Thy party here is zhe implementation of Innovation (ab)used
by 'Sentry'. Measks what thar mean with Innovation at this place. It's just 
a common party (that's isn't a bad thing by any means) but where is the
Innovation? Solutions can be sent to Fazantenkamp 193, Maarssen. Please
write these words on the letter: 'E M H A A' (for easier/faster handling).
(The later, the crapper (?)).....



Pfff, i think it's now 1 or 2 o'clock ! It's Zx now, totally tired !! We've 
just finished the movie 'Brain Dead', really funny, but i've fall asleep 
8 or 10 times , not because the film was to quiet, but i've again eat to 
much chips, and as always, i burn too much calories...and use my power....
now i'll try to understand where i am, who i am , and where i'll go....
my plan is now ready : 1o Drink something, 2o Eat something, 3o Read 
something, ....( continue yourself this text in using the 5000 english verbs
followed of ' something'....now it's really time to sleep, sleeeeeeeeeeeep
ZXxxx...

2:09
 
Heeellooo, dis is D.C desperately trying to make some sense out of this crazy 
party text (the Particle as I like to call it). I think dis party's goal has 
been succeeded by miles.(?) As you can see by my poor English it's  purdy late
and we've just finished that comedy-film 'BrainDead' I REALLY laughed my 
balls off, this movie is just so completely dumb that it becomes very funny at
the end , all the peoples limbs are pulled of their ears are being eaten by
some sort of zombies and everybodies naked. (note that I spelled it with an I
and an E..) no nonsense to type anymore so BYE BYE...


2:57
 
Well, as nobody seems to be able to type anything, I think it's my turn again
at the moment everybody is falling asleep, and the other half(?) is plaing on 
the SNES, Rapido of Synergy is converting his routine to calculate pictures
for the tridi-screen to assembler, and eagle is very busy trying to arrange a 
place to sleep for everybody. At this time there is a joint venture going on 
between two SNES-consoles. Their goal: driving me to the utmost edge of my 
sanity, and trying to get me to become very, very tired. their facilities are
known as the audiovisual way of manipulating the brain, using the music of
Super-MarioWorld and the music of Streetfighter II simultaneously to be aimed 
at an end of my head each, entering my brain through those voids, commonly 
known as one of our,seven, senses namely, my ears....  My head is becoming 
rather red at the moment, and I'm beginning to feel very hot (in the sense of
heat that is) Many people are pissed off at the moment becoz fransje woke most
of them up to move their mats around, everybody wants to sleep, not me really
I've no sleep at all, becoz I've gone past my sleep right now, if I did
try to sleep at this moment I would only become very duff and would not have
been able to write this great text for you!!! (sigh, yes you guys, it has come
so far that i'm laming some real crap on this board, like 'I'm NICE', naaah
you wouldnt believe me anyway...
Hey, it's time for a LITTLE conversation between me and my brain.
hello, brain..

nothing, well as you can clearly see my mind is (as usual (ask Havoc)) 
completely empty. So dear Havoc if you have any suggestions to what to 
type next please state them clearly, but in a soft tone coz my ears haaaaaaaa
 FUCK YOU!!!!!!  Havoc, seemed to be reading over my shoulder, well you have 
to wait a sec now coz Havoc(yezz again HIM!!!) sez I hef toe sie hiz tekst f
usrtsdwe   eeeuh... soory must 've dozed of for a while no, while Havoc is 
being a nutered super-rabbit he's rait now fucking of his cigarette , and
looking very amused at the smoke coming of his c'rette, well I finally am
convinced of his utmost intelligence, which naturally (yezz, spelled it 
right!!) rises with very few points above the average of an american
mormon who has just heard from his mommie that santa claus doesn't exist
and that his neighbours' nephews' dog had two kittens that were killed in a 
car accident between a camel and a rabbit, which lies aproxximately above 20
 'The Lord is my father' cries Havoc, yes, he really is creing, his mom, maria
just told him he was the new and IMPROVED Jesus (met vleugeltjes) with extra
magic for extra power.Right now Havoc is pissing off my favourite coder,
Vulture, hey somebody is joining us now in our daily talk-show with iprah 
wonfrey (hmmm, sound familiar to you, dunno why?) Everybody is now joining
Fox to look at the screen of his Falcon030, why you might ask?, well he 
started a Raytracing programme a few hours ago and we are waiting patiently
for the result...............which should have beeen ready by now... Hehe
I remembered O.T.M's name 'Life's a bitch' (C) by O.T.M  dis piece of text was
written by the creme de la creme of Odyssey creative design, namely me the 
very simple and humble D.C , O.T.M is gonna write something now (I ordered him
to ) so  C  U  L-8-TER.........

Well, according to D.C. I have the honours again for writing some crap again.
So let's see is we can squize something out of ze old mind. 
O yeah something on that "Life is a Bitch" thing, I don't have the copyrights
on that one, but I'm working on the rights of "retal uoy ees". When I got them
you will be (ofcourse) the first one to know. 
When I went over here to Breda (by Train) I had the intention to code 
something nice, or at least get some inspirition, but till sofar nothing
in those regions have happened, but there are still a few hours to go.

The saddest thing happened just a few moments ago I guy which used a 
Raytrace program called Pov had his Falcon working on some data for
almost 13 hours, and when it was nearly there something went wrong. The
file which was produced was corrupted, and we saw it in True paint but
it wasn't that special. So I think I'll await the arrival of the Falcon
040 and skip the 030. 

I thought sleep was for the mortal, and I had some back-up  here, but now 
everybody is getting ready to sleep a bit. A question comes to mind, will
I be the only one awake, and will I survive the night? You'll never know
until you stick with. You just gotta hold on a little longer, it's now
almost 4 o'clock in the morning so to survive the night won't be a problem.

I have to give Kornelis Kunsthars Produktion Steenwijk B.V. some credits,
it is due to them that I can stay awake for so long, because I had to work 
on the night shift for the last week, and now here I am still typing, and
thinking crap. Someone is now sitting besides me, maybe I'd better ask
if he would like to write something for the D.B.A. realtime article for
number 9

WOULD YOU LIKE TO WRITE ANYTHING TO OUR WONDERFULL READERS???

THE ANSWER IS YES...


Hello everybody,I am zigi.You don't know who I am because i'm from the amiga 
scene.Well,I would like to say that's this party is really a good one.It's
the first ST party I come to but I can say that dudes in ST parties are 
cooler than dudes in amiga parties.I think I'd better leave this now...zigi
is signing off...bye

Well I'm happy that there are still some people who appriciate the ST-scene.
Sorry, forgot to introduce myself, this is O.T.M. back again so you can 
move a bit further down I'll give you a sign when I'm signing off so you
won't be bored. 
Well it's **cki** 4 o'clock in the morning what do you expect me to write.
Let me see, what is still left in my poor tired brainzzzz. A yes, I see
I could tell you some very old jokes 

Joke number 1

Why is a belgium ambulance 14 metres long???

don't know

 1 metre for the engine
 1 metre for the driver
 1 metre for the patient
 1 metre for the docter
and 10 metres for the choir: "TAAAATUUUU TAAAAATUUUU"

Joke number 2

Who invented the fence-wire???

Two dutch people they where fighting over a dime!!!

Joke number 3

Sorry no more jokes (<---- and still that's another) this is due to the
fact that some people want to sleep, and that I am a lamer.

This is still O.T.M. boring you, but the reinforcements have arived:
in the form of Havoc and Zigi and we are going to do some word-translations
so here we go:
