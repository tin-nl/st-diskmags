F-PATCH FOR GFA

We all know that small prg called FPATCH which we mostly use in
the AUTO folder so we are able to hear the sound the Falcon makes. But 
if we start up without the AUTO folder there are no sounds to hear unless 
the programmer has chanced that. Well to say the least most of them 
don't, out of lazyness or just don't know how. 

But the GFA programmers, they will never forget it again after they 
have seen this. Here is another small listing that does exactly the 
same as FPATCH. We just disassembled it and re-wrote it in GFA, and to
be honest it isn't that special. The guy's at Atari just forgot some 
pointers to set which you will have to do now...

PROCEDURE sound_patch
  VOID XBIOS(&H8B,0,8,0,0,1)      !  Device connect...
  VOID XBIOS(&H84,0)              !  Set 8 bit stereo 
  VOID XBIOS(&H82,2,&H40)         !  Reduce volume left input channel
  VOID XBIOS(&H82,3,&H40)         !  also right channel
  VOID XBIOS(&H82,6,3)            !  Set Pre Scale (divisible by 160)
  VOID XBIOS(&H82,4,3)            !  ADDRIN
  VOID XBIOS(&H82,5,3)            !  ADC input set to L+R soundchip
  VOID XBIOS(&H2C,&HFFFE)         !  Unknown (I don't know it)
RETURN

You see, easy if you know it. Build this in your own demo, game or 
whatever uses the sound and voila it works. So if you have any tips
left for GFA basic send them in and we can help other GFA programmers 
in the future on the Falcon.
