LYNX PIT-FIGHTER REVIEW
========================

Hallokidoki!
The Crap is back with a review of PIT FIGHTER

By Atari.

You're a team of three fighters: Buzz, Ty and Kato.
Your goal is to take part at the big championship, but 
before you get there, you must fight for it. There are no 
rules everything is allowed, got a chair? Throw it at your 
opponent. Is your opponent lying on the ground? Kick him in 
the back!                   

The Game:

When the title screen has appeared it show the credits with 
at the background somesort of shop window mode.(a demo of 
the game)Press A or B to continue.

A player selector appears. I select Ty. You can also Link 
the game. You can play against someone or with someone. The 
game starts.

On the screen are the pictures of each fighter, their names 
and information about their records, including the amount 
of money won, the number of knock outs and their health 
meters. The bottom of the screen shows the amount of time 
since the round started, the number of credits remaining, 
the name of your opponent(s) and the knock-out record.

You know what to do, kick your opponent knock out with 
everything you can find or do.

The controls:Left,right,up,down to move your player.
A to kick and B to punch.
A+B together to jump.
Opt.2 to evade your opponent.
Opt.2 + joypad down to pick up a object or your opponent, B 
to throw it away.
Opt.1 + down to duck.
Opt.1 + up to attack two opponents at the same time, when 
you're between them.
Opt.1 to make a super move, that's for each player 
different.

It's a difficult game, your opponents are to hard to beat.

Rating and stuff like that:

The goods:
The grafix are good although they're not that spectacular 
coz' they are digitized. The game is linkable.

The bads:
The music and the soundfx aren't that good.
