FRIED BITS 3 REAL-TIME P8
~DUST.FIL~

13:00 <Genie!> Well, that's me packed up, so all I have to do is wait
      around for about 2 hours then go to the airport. So what did I think
      of the Bits then? Like wow, it was massive! Also, I'm sure everybody
      back at PBHQ will feel a bit deflated when they see the new demos by
      the compy winners (In order- Lazer, EKO and Avena.) The standard of
      Falcon stuff has sky-rocketed!

13:07 Havoc for the last time... We're gonna go away as soon as my dad arrives. 
      Resuming: cool party, but last year was better. Okey, the productions 
      were better than last year, but the atmosphere was less. See you later, 
      gonna go now.

13:10 XTC1 for the last time. 
      Status: BRAINDEAD.
      Prospects: NONE.
      FUTURE: ?.
      PAST: ?!.
      But whatever happens, see you next year....
      If there will be no party here, we will hijack this place.
      If I only could make it trough the next few hours.
       =:x     

13:13  Name : Slimer
       Current Status : Diseased ....

       R.I.P.

13:14 We're here from the Senior Dads crew! You should have seen the jaws 
      drop when we our "Anal Tuck" demo was shown off last night. [That's 
      what everybody was going on about when they mentioned the last entry in 
      the 96ktro competition, so we are the realtime article writers choice!] 
      We ended up 5th in the 96ktro competition, which means that we are in 
      the European Top 5 of short intro coders!!! So watch out for us, WE ARE 
      ON OUR WAY!!!!! See yas laters next year.....

13:21 We, tnb, will now leave the party! Undercover 5 will be out soon...
      Sorry... We would release this issue on the party but we haven't an
      intro for it... 

13:23 No comments, Fox

13:24 Das wars dann mal wieder, Tyan sagt `schuess .... hakkkkkeeeeee!!!

13:29 Well, the Fried Bits III is now all most over. We are preparing to leave
      and I will meet my girl soon. :-)
      See you on the Fried Tits IV.           Samurai of Inter

13:51 Nightmare and Questor have just left the building !

13:52 Still no Pizza available ...

13:53 The Dead Hackers Society hasn't left the party yet.
      Hmm.. Not until 02.00 (this night) when the train leaves..../ Yeager

14:00 Aggression has left the building.

14:00 Setok runs after Aggression

14:00 <Genie!> The Dutch crews are looking at a home video of the Bits, and 
      it's showing one of Dead Hackers Society snoring at the moment!

14:10 I must confess I told you a lie about an hour ago. I said I wouldn't be 
      back, but here I am... Havoc back, thank God it isn't for good. We're 
      still waiting for the car to arrive. I'm sure it should have been here at 
      one o'clock, but something must have gone wrong. Zit ik hier godverdomme 
      nog te wachten, kutzooi. Ik wil m'n eigen bed, lekker slapen.... mmmm.... 
      Ik wil wat normaals te eten... Ik wil twee weken geen woord meer horen 
      over die kutcomputer. De koppijn is gelukkig een beetje weg, maar voor de 
      rest is alles zoals gewoonlijk klote. Ik haat GfA, Assembler, design, 
      graphics, magazines, demos en al die andere troep (tenminste, op dit 
      moment). Gelul, inderdaad. Ga weg met je Engels, geen kut zin in. Ik ben 
      geen eikel, eikel. Zit niet zo dom te blaten, geit, en beledig de Here 
      ook niet (is niet leuk, nee, Robertootje). Geen shut up, eikel, ik hou 
      m'n bek ech nie. Teer op. Nee, ik weet ook niet wat er met de tab gebeurt 
      is. Ik haat alle floating, mutant en gewone dots. Yuck. Kut dots. De 
      inspiratie is weg, dus ik kap met tikken. Havoc gettin' outta here.

14:24 3D sux.
      2D sux.
      D sux.
      Bye.

14:30  Well, that's me going to go. It's been an erm... interesting 
       experience! Bye bye! <Genie!>

14:32  Ach joh, niemand zal dit ooit lezen...
14:33  Goof Master of the lame game is signing off.......
       klik Bbbbzzzzz......

14:32  Dit is wel grappig.

14:33  That's it, the party is over, all contenders have gone home. D.B.A. is 
       packing also. It was fun and the climax is nearing.... Bye Bye

       The D.B.A. (O.T.M. Bonus and Slimer)
