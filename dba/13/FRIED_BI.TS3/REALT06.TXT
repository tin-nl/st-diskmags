FRIED BITS 3 REAL-TIME P6
~DUST.FIL~


18:17 1+1=3 (One + One = three -> SYNERGY) 
      Just to show were degrated ourselves to complete Lameness, we are not
      doing anything at all just drinking, well, sperm or equivalently
      'something we can chew on' auch! Synergy is dead! and !GOD! do we like
      this new perspective! Ah ja,gut mal!
      Scavenger is still doing some great music (commercially), and B.A.T. is
      fucking up the PC. Zanac is into the commercial stuff to, and I, Rapido
      has turn into the complety lamer I already was to begin with.
      Ahhhh, It's so relaxing ...... I don't have to do fast algoritms any-
      more, and it's great! I just drink beer all the time and say:
      'Just listen to me man...! I know what I talking about! ..... 
      I'm Rapido, you know from SYNERGY!'

      .......... SYNERGY???? ...... Don't know you guys......

      Well, what ever... 

      Willy down below sea level... 


18.25 XTC1 back online.I wil take this time now to explain a little bit
      about the 'Sentry Story'. The complete beginning is a bit unknown to
      us because we joined Sentry after the first Fried Bits. So from there
      on the story is known to us (XTC1/Ultimate). Eagle was then main coder,
      ISO main musician, and MAC grafixx. Whe came in as alternate coder or 
      musician (I am the last type). By that time the idea was to split
      Sentry in a Falcon Commercial wing (XLR8) and the ST wing (us, former 
      DULL (Dutch Unknown Lemmings and Lamers) known as Sentry).
      Then suddenly out of nowhere Eagle decided to give up coding, and left 
      Sentry/XLR8. We then continued with some other projects, from wich only a 
      very few ever got finished. About 2 months ago Ultimate got his Falcon
      so then finally we could start on this machine. We started a weak ago
      with the DSP, and this chip looks great for some ideas we have developed.
      And a few days ago we heard that Eagle has bought a 4 mb STe or Mega STe 
      and has started coding again. ISO is a musician with a big amiga crew, 
      and Mac, well, we lost contact with him but really want it back online.
      && us,we are planning to continue living and coding (I seem to have 
      started coding DSP (according to Goof of giants better known for 'Dis 
      Starts Paranoia'). Good times are coming, and Eagle, if you are coming in 
      again, join the club, and hope to see you soon.

      Lets quit here, and hope we answered some questions. Thanks.

18:54 Impressive, most impressive... No current loss of power this hour... I`d 
      better wait for the 5th one before I start to code again... 
      Longshot/Impulse



18:57 Errm, well, yes, Okey, I'l promise not to get philosophic again, but what 
      should I write then? What about some secret information? Okido, here we 
      go... Did you know there is someone cheating the modcompetition? No? So 
      now you do know it. Some hints wanted? Names, names, all mixed up and 
      confusing... Greets to Slima. Still no idea what has happened? Okey, 
      that's your problem, but I don't think it's wise to tell you more before 
      the competition is over and the money is in our wallets... Different 
      story then? Have you ever heard the story about the German guy who woke 
      up with his hands in a dish of water? He must have been quite lucky not 
      to have pissed in his own sleepingbag. But it's his own fault, he 
      probably didn't knew that he shouldn't make chainsaw noises in the Dutch 
      sleepingroom. Punishment can sometimes be justified. Like for instance 
      now. Haha. Inspiration flows out of me, beer flows in. There is someone 
      waiting to write, so I'd better quit now. Take your chance, Sparerib!

19:06 How can someone cheat in a module comp...?

19:07 It ain't that hard if you've got Protracker and know how to change sample 
      names... But that's classified, and I won't tell more until those guys 
      have won (never) or lost (imminent).

19:1o Anyone's modeming here? Contact me....   /PhoneR
      No job ... no money ... NO CARRIER ... ;)

19:something: Sigh, Played soccer haven't you, you little shit!
      You know this is a game for the masses?
      It's like watching an arena full of farmhands acting like complete
      braindead morons.
      The ball bounces......
      The farts are so loud......
      I can't take this.....
      It's so primitive.....
      Where are the girls?...
      It's a boyish game....
      I'm not interested.... So there!
      Rapido out...
    

19:some more:What's wrong with soccer? Yes, I played goalkeeper until I broke 
      my leg in seven places when I was 10 (I guess).
      Anyone opposed to soccer has probably never played the game himself.
      And if you think tennis is a civilized game, you've never seen me playing 
      it (that's quite likely in fact coz I don't play tennis at all). Tennis 
      is something like chewing some gum and then (by accident) swallowing it. 
      In other words, I don't like it. Why? Becoz it's stupid, that's why. Have 
      you ever heard of a game which you can play on at least four different 
      soils? And they don't even change the rules when it gets boring (like 
      allowing the players to hit eachother with the rackets... fun!)

      I admit I can't make up many arguments against tennis, but it still 
      sucks.

19:(it still is) DOES ANYONE PLAY TENNIS? IF YOU ARE READING THIS I WANT TO
      DARE YOU! JUST ASK FOR RAPIDO IN THE ROOM JUST BEHIND YOU! I've got two
      really cool rackets, together with some very round balls. 
      (Remark 1): You have to be better than average.
      (Remark 2): If you win, I'll buy you a beer, and vice versa, well
                  you know what to do......

19:(something and some more): I guess I won't try to beat Rapido at tennis, but 
      tennis still sucks. Beck's beer doesn't. Who the fuck is Beck's?      
      NO CARRIER... NO AEROPLANES... NO WAR...
      Havoc gets out now.

19:48 I just entered our 96k tro ( boy this will be a laugh )

                                                      Bonus

19:50 We're just on to finish our 96ktro. Most wanted, guy. Wait for it.
            Signed: Tea and Bee.

19:51 (Loke/DHS) <sigh> Party's quite nice... I wish I had been working harder
      on the 96ktro though... It would have been nice to participate
      although we wouldn't have won...
      It will be released in a month or so anyway...
      PLEASE! Anybody got a good name for it???? It has to be a little SILLY!

19:53 Farting Shadows.. good?

19:54 How about 'Boobla Bobbla'?

So, wir schalten das hier jetzt aus!

21:07 sehr komisch. vor drei stunden sollte die demo fertig sein,
      jetz ist sie es fast und es ist neun. ich bin voll gut drauf
      weil sich mein kopf wie eine wildgewordene horde kampf-
      rhinozerosse verhaelt weil ich seit ich hier angekommen bin
      so oberboese kopfschmerzen hab das alles reicht. schmutz.

21:38 The competition is nearing, the Dutchies will show their awesome 
      coding skills very soon now ....

      Slimer

21:45 Well the Pizza just arrived, so I think this is the right time
      to say hello to everybody.
      Wie immer werden die Demos nicht zur rechten Zeit fertig und so sehen
      die Leute dann auch aus. Ich muss schon sagen die Zeiten haben
      sich absolut nicht geaendert. Deswegen finde ich die ganze
      Angelegenheit auch sehr erheiternd. Aber ich glaub ich hoere jetzt
      lieber auf, sonst werde ich noch von einigen Leuten verhauen.

Realtime conversation between Sparehead 3 (Reservoir Gods), Genie (Pure 
Bollocks), Havoc (Giants) and Slimer (D.B.A.). Read it and weep!


22:51 The Glass Ball Grows As The Glass Blower Blows...A Tiny Glass Swan From 
      His Blow Pipe Flows... 

22:51 I thought cannabis was illegal in the U.K.?

22:52 We are in Germany...

22:52 I thought cannabis was illegal in Germany too?

22:52 Is it? Oh shit!

22:53 Where do you have it? Thump, thump, AaaaAArrrrGhhh, give it to me ... 
      (did you know cannabis is the only drug that solves a headache?)

22:54 Well, there must be cannabis in my paracetomol because that works pretty 
      well...

22:55 So you think you have been taking papacetamol all these years...?  ha ha 
      ha...I have substituted my dog's fart tablets for the last decade!

22:56 So your dog must be quite high?

22:56 He never has a headache!

22:57 He doesn't go bark, he goes "wooo...f"

22:58 But the dog must be farting a lot then, surely?

22:58 Yes...but I blame it on your Mother.

22:58 Mother Maria or the other one?

22:59 yes.

23:00 okey.

23:00 Anyway, there's not been so much problems since we put a cork up the dogs
      bottom.

23:00 It's sticking out of the dog's nose, probably?

23:00 Well, it is only a chihuahua!

23:01 Cool! Ren & Stimpy rule! (Stimpy's a chihuahua)

23:02 What? A cork up Ren & Stimpy's rear end?

23:03 Both of their asses?

23:03 Yes, but I think that might be a bit of problem with only one cork.

23:03 If it sticks out of Ren's nose, you might be able to put that end in 
      Stimpy's ass... By the way, it's just a cartoon, that means everything's 
      possible...

23:07 If you take hold of Slimer's balls & shake them...they ring out a tune!

23:08 You'll also hear Slimer shouting very loudly. (Depends on which balls
      though.)

23:09 The 'Sound Of Slimer's Balls' will be in the MOD competition. (c) Sentry.

23:15 I hate waiting !!!

23:20 Still waiting for another deadline...

jezz is musiccompetition!

23:28 All are going downstairs now!!!


** DAY 4 (MON. 17 APRIL)


00:10 Listening to stupid MODS, i hate those jerky sounds!!!

00:35 Still listening to those MODS, getting crazed!!

00:40 Doef,Doef,ping,Doef,Doef,ping,ping,ping,Doef,Doef,Ding
      Zip,zip,zop,zop,Doef doef dedoef doef,ping ping ping,
      Going bezerk, it never seems to stop !!!

00:41 Good lord in heaven, it's over, finaly

00:43 Pissmuzak...

00:44 Irgendwie alles der gleiche Schxxx!

00:45 Oh my ears... Bundestag, alle gut (nicht). Noff noff

00:49 The music competetion suxxed. The sound equipment suxx, too.
      I really hope that the next time it will be better!
      Well, I also think that it should be more girls here. I can hardly
      wait to give them some "swedish steel"!

00:50 Agree on the above to 100%!!

00:52 No man, German 'STeel' rulez!!!

00:54 Jep, sucker !! :) Here is j.a.d.e / d u n e .. Hummmm.. Musikcompi 
      very crazy , to much techno !!! 

00:55 We Swedes have a different taste of music. Partically the groups
      from france seems to object to our execellent type of music :-)))
      Bundestag!!!

00:57 ... obviously, they have no other chance - due to (I guess) almost 
      1000000Watts ...

01:02 There were some quite unusual MODules, I liked them!

1:03 Number 9 every time

01:04 Module Shit, hell Tempus is fucking up on me!!!!!! (o.t.m.)

01:05 About the music competition. Personally I couldn`t hear a single
      tune for all the F```````ing  BASSSSS!!!!!!!

01:07 <Genie!> That module no. 9 sounded like it was the result of a corrupted 
      disk. It was great!

01:09 A little some thing fron NoCrew .We are sorry about the volume
      ,We forgot the remotecontrol to our Yamaha DSP1000 (216*7 Watt).
   
01:22 About swedish music : your music is OK, men. except when your just 
      right in front of your 200 watt stereo system...
                                                                               
02:21 What dont like it? 

02:22 The last 96Ktro was the best!

02:22 The music inte 96ktro competition was far better than the music in
      the music competition.!!

02:25 Especially the last one!

02:26 ... but the handmade music coming from cd is much better! Even though 
      dope ist forbidden in Germany and Pink Floyd is best to be enjoyed when 
      having smoked a ... uh ya know thot I mean?!?
      cookie was it, who destroyed the lawful thoughts about German people ;-)
