    Some people reading this may well feel a pang or two of  'deja-vu' 
    hitting  them below the kneecaps,  as the original version of this 
    text  first appeared as long ago as Maggie Twelve..  This has  now 
    been  extensively re-written,  and a lot of the sadder 'computery' 
    stuff has been culled out,  and other new chapters put in instead, 
    so I thought, time to use it again..  - CIH-

    Four Billion Years ago,  Friday,  early afternoon.    Planet Earth    
    stirs  uneasily  in the form of very hot lava  soup,  which  forms 
    itself into momentary shapes of The Point Entertainment Complex at 
    Milton  Keynes,  David Bowie (In his 'Aladdin Sane' period,),  the 
    radiator  grille  of  a Second World War Willys  Jeep,  and  other 
    things  too  fantastic to mention.   Unfortunately,  this show  is 
    staged  before  a  totally unappreciative,  not  to  mention  non-
    existent  audience.   This goes on for a couple of billion  years, 
    they  may  be  awaiting  rain or  something...

    Two  billion.666666  recurring years ago.   Primordial soup  gives 
    rise  to  first primitive organisms such as  Marketing  Manager... 
    Primordial  soup  shoots  itself  in  the  head  screaming  "Never 
    Again!!"  Son  of  Primordial Soup has another go,  and  no  false 
    starts  this  time...  Continental drift starts up about now  when 
    Asia put into reverse gear and the clutch let out very gently.. 

    One  billion  Years ago,  precisely...  First primitive amoeba and 
    seashell-like  creatures  appear,  first Hi-Fi mags with reams  of 
    vastly overpriced and 'designey' stuff no-one really wants appear, 
    otherwise, not too much going on as it is a February after all.

    Five  Hundred Million Years ago.   First attempts to colonise land 
    ends  in  failure and timeshare apartments,  primitive plant  life 
    forms  dominoes group in the lounge bar of a downmarket  pub  (and 
    here they are still today!!)

    Two Hundred Million Years ago..  Due to a tragic miscalculation in 
    scale, the first dinosaur predators are only six inches tall.. The 
    next  generation  are  more successful,  but still do not  go  out 
    anywhere  without their Ray-Ban 'cool' shades and  other  poseur's 
    accessories.   Australia  currently attempting difficult  manouvre 
    into  a  very tight parking space,  it has had five goes,  and has 
    still to manage it...  

    One  Hundred  Million  Years  ago.   Dinosaur age  at  it's  peak, 
    Dinosaur   self-help  groups  abundant,   home-made  recipes   for 
    Triceratops  pie  widely spread,  first CD-ROM  home  entertaiment 
    units  launched (Ultimately not successful..) First Metallica  gig 
    held  thirty  feet below the sea surface in  what  is  present-day 
    Antwerp..

    Fifty Million Years ago,  two thirty am... Big dinosaur party goes 
    on with everybody getting totally pissed, watch the skies folks!!

    Forty  Million  Years  ago,  With all the dinosaurs  undergoing  a 
    massive hangover of the 'Two Nuclear explosions in the head  every 
    second' sort, nobody is in any condition to spot the huge asteroid 
    bearing  down  like an indignant jilted bride's mother  on  errant 
    bridegroom Earth, let alone duck out of the way.....

    Forty Million Years minus two seconds..  BOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!!

    Thirty-nine Million Years....  Still very dark and quiet with lots 
    of  smoke around the place,  last surviving dinosaur rings 'Yellow 
    Pages' for emergency furniture restorer, who fails to turn up...

    Twenty  Million  years,  orange...  As if from nowhere,  the first 
    mammals  emerge from their hiding places in Pizza Hut  restarants, 
    and are promptly clobbered by first ice age....  Tough.

    Ten Million Years ago... A rich variety of mammalian life evolves, 
    some  unique and freakish creatures hang around the  Santa  Monica 
    area until told that Sesame Street won't actually be invented  for 
    another ten million years or so.   Most of these become extinct in 
    a fit of pique,  disappearing stage left in a huff... 

    One Million Years (B.C.)..  Raquel Welch invents the Sabre-Toothed 
    Tiger  skin bikini.   Second Ice Age turns up to play Hitler Youth 
    Militiamen  wearing  Big Boots with any exposed skin,  which is  a 
    bit of a bummer actually. 

    Fifty-Thousand  Years Ago..  The Neolithic Union Insurance Company 
    has  great problems keeping track of all their  policyholders  who 
    are  all called 'Ug'.   Channel 'Land-Bridge' to link England  and 
    France proposed.

    Twenty Thousand Years ago.   Channel 'Land-Bridge' opened, just in 
    time for third ice age and shoddy materials to plough it back into 
    the  English  Channel again...  Contractors say "Stuff this,  lets 
    build  a tunnel next time.." But planning permission  and  general 
    building trade related sodding around take another twenty thousand 
    years or so.

    Ten Thousand Years Ago, wet and windy... Early Egyptians await go-
    ahead  for  civilisation to start,  but are put off the  idea  for 
    another  five  thousand years by  an  adverse  shipping  forecast. 
    Sponsorship deal for pyramids falls through so 'Endsleigh-Barclays 
    Great  Pyramid'  a  bit  of  a  non-starter...   

    Five Thousand Years...  Warrant issued for the arrest of Atlantis, 
    the  mythical  continent,  which promptly goes into  hiding  under 
    water.   Unfortunately,  the  five  million people living  on  its 
    surface  are not told about this sudden,  hasty move by  Atlantis, 
    and promptly drown...

    Two Thousand years Ago...  Julius Caesar supposedly warned "Beware 
    the Ides of March" before being assassinated.   We can reveal that 
    he was really warned "Beware the virus of March",  which was a bit 
    of a nasty sniffle going around Rome at the time.   He still ended 
    up wearing someone else's steak-knives in his head though.

    One Thousand Years ago..  The Dark Ages... The Roman empire having 
    mislaid  that last fifty pence on a Friday night sometime  in  440 
    AD,  and the banks are all shut now,  means the meter goes 'plink' 
    and  we  have  everyone stumbling  around  with  candles..  People 
    console  themselves with sackcloth robes,  easily preventable  but 
    fatal childhood diseases, and church-building...

    Five Hundred Years ago...  1500AD,  thereabouts.  A major disaster 
    for everyone as America  is discovered, mislaid in a restaurant in 
    Seville, found again, and sold off in a cart-boot sale...

    Two hundred and fifty Years ago... 1700 and something.. The Age of 
    Reason,  people  ask why is everything so bloody pointless and why 
    do they have to wear those stupid long powdered wigs, and even the 
    blokes wear pretty satin bows on their coats,  can we keep America 
    as  a  colony???  Is  having a large population of  blind  beggars 
    morally justified??? Pass the grog Jim Lad!!

    (Complete collapse of heavy metal music, which only picks up again 
    during the French Revolution..)

    125  Years  ago...  Victorian age of self-confidence and  sparsely 
    illustrated  sex-manuals.   India  melted down for useful  metals, 
    Alexander Graham Bell invents chat-line and 0898 services, various 
    other  blokes  invent  electricity,   corrugated  iron,   and  the 
    automatic gas-driven self-loading machine gun.   The last of these 
    inventions becomes very, very important in due course.

    Lemme  see,   about  fifty  years  ago...   Berlin.   With  Soviet 
    forces closing in,  and things generally not going too well, Adolf 
    Hitler  realises at last that 'The jig is up' and tries to  commit 
    suicide  by nailing several clockwork frogs to his head.   Quite a 
    lot  of  people's parents may be around by this time??  These  two 
    events are not related.

    Twenty-Five Years Ago.   "One Small Step for Man", Neil Armstrong, 
    regular  customer of the 'Lamb and Flag' catches the  'wrong  bus' 
    home  and  finds  himself making history by stepping  out  onto  a 
    barren place that is not anywhere near Barking High Street.

        Now.  Well, I'd better get this finished then...

    Ten Minutes Later.  Now this is silly!!

    Now again.  Time to go...

                      Bye!

     A CIH thing.
