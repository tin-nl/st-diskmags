Welcome to the second part of the 'GOSSIP' *the* news section of the
D.B.A. diskmagazine. Our reporters roam the scene, sticking bugs under
tables and hiding cameras behind your power-sockets. Via satellites,
portable telephones and couriers on horses dropped out of planes, the
information comes flowing in. Bank-accounts get hacked and the most
intimate personal stuff gets published in the widely spread D.B.A. disk-
magazine. 


** JAGUAR CARDS FOR SINCLAIR ZX81 **

- Atari is planning to build Jaguar cards for the Sinclair ZX81. Thousands 
  of ZX81 computers are packed in boxes still waiting in warehouses to find 
  their way to the customers. Sinclair had plans to destroy them but with the
  Jaguar card upgrade this won't be necessary.


** HAVOC MARRIED **

- In the previous Gossip you could read that Havoc (Giants) got married.   
  He personally asked Slimer (D.B.A.) to be his witness/best-man. Slimer has 
  gladly accepted his offer. Six men were necessary to hold Gorilla Sue    
  down in order to get the wedding-ring around her finger. 


** SABOTAGED INSTALL PROCEDURE **

- Rumours go that the D.B.A. magazine Install procedure is sabotaged.       
  Besides installing the magazine it also shuffles your Hard drive          
  partitions. The program also contains a routine that instead of packing  
  programs is exploding programs ten times their original size. All 
  programs get also encrypted (3 levels deep).

  A program to restore your Hard drive to it's original setup can be 
  obtained for only 50 pounds.


** PORTABLE WASHING-MACHINES **

- Atari is now also in portable washing-machines. This new device fits in   
  the palm of your hand and is able to wash everything. The new washing
  machines are based on the Jaguar technology. Before you can wash your    
  clothes with it, it is necessary to wash them first in your normal       
  washing machine at 95 degrees and with a cheap washing-powder.   


** COMMODORE BOUGHT BY JAPANESE VIBRATOR MANUFACTURER ? **

  Rumours go that negotiations are being held between Commodore Business 
  Machines and the Japanese firm 'Hasivibro'. The latter firm wants to use
  the Amiga technology in their new range of 'Super Vibros'(tm). Plans for 
  a Virtual Reality Helmet connected to the vibrator are in development. 
  People using the 'Super Vibro'(tm) will have the opportunity to witness  
  exciting movies and images while using this new Super Vibrator. Movies 
  can range from the big quake in the Japanese city Kobe till images of 
  my little pony ... (naughty)


** REALITY OR FICTION ? **

  The first experiments with the V.R. Helmet of the new Gameboy has proved
  disastrous. People wearing the new V.R. Helmet for more than 20 minutes 
  lost the sense to tell reality from fiction. First reports on this          
  new phenomenon indicates that for instance kids can't distinguish their father
  from Mario or visa versa. Scientist's fear for the consequences when 
  Doom gets released on this machine ... 

  This is of course all bollocks but who says that this can't actually happen
  in the near future ...


** S.M. PROGRAM DEVELOPED **

  The International Sado Masochist Association have hired coders to develop
  a fully automated pain injector. The idea to put a certain private part    
  in the diskdrive slot. The program allows you to perform several painful
  tasks with the head of the drive. Features include slow/fast formatting 
  partial or complete formatting, track seek and an exclusive new option.
  This new option has to do with electric shocks and water ... This new
  program is aimed at people without any partners or handicapped people.

  Future releases will be supplied with additional hardware (i.e., high-
  voltage power gloves covered with spikes), explosives and chemicals.
