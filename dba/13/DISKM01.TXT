DISKMAG ROUNDUP P1
~TROEP.FIL~
       A FOURTH ATTEMPT AT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DISK MAGAZINE ROUNDUP!
                             by Richard Karsmakers
                   Some additional updates(status) by Slimer

 In  ST NEWS Volume 7 Issue 2 the first version of this disk  magazine  roundup 
appeared,  and  about  one  year later (in ST NEWS Volume 8 Issue 2)  I  did  a 
revised version.  In Volume 9 Issue 2 you could find the re-revised version and 
now,  finally, you have within your grasp the fourth of the annual revisions of 
the  ultimate disk magazine roundup for Atari ST/TT/Falcon users.  Most  likely 
you'll continue getting revisions on a more or less annual basis.
This  revision  contains 142 entries,  of which 44 are references  to  on-line 
efforts.
 I  have  refrained  from  trying to include all  online  magazines  (like  the 
hundreds of different Net Digests,  to name but one common class of  examples), 
and instead only included the ones that may be of interest to general ST  users 
and fiction afficionados.
 Thanks  need to go to Dave Mooney and John Weller of "STEN" (even though  they 
r.i.p.) for the original idea back in '91 or '92 somewhere,  and a lot of other 
people (mainly disk magazine editors,  James "He's Got The Power" Matthews  and 
e-zine list compiler John Labovitz) whom I can't possibly all start  mentioning 
here. Cheers to all you guys!

  it like (very briefly)?
 Latest  known issue:  The latest (or last) known issue of the  magazine.  This 
  particular  information is limited to my own knowledge and it  therefore  not 
  infallible at all!

  passed  away  already?   Interestingly,  there  are  also  a  few  in-between 
  possibilities.
 Language: What language is (or which languages are) used in the magazine?
===============================================================================

AAUSAC

 A  disk mag by the Association of Atari Users in Schools And Colleges.  It  is 
put together by a chap called Terry Freedman,  and its aim is to bring together 
teachers and lecturers who use the Atari in their work.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. An old version of the Newsdisk shell.
 Latest know issue: Number 1.
 Address: 45 Douglas Road, Goodmayes, Essex, England.
 Health: Alive?

Access Magazine

 This magazine gives access to a behind the scenes glimpse of people and  place 
you've always wondered about,  while revealing all they can discover about  the 
world of entertainment (and they claim to be rather good at this). They provide 
you  with  up-to-date info on everything from the supernatural to  the  art  of 
cooking.  It's said to be very diverse,  but no hands-on experience here.  It's 
bi-monthly, and its editor is Shirley Bragg. It started early 1994.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Not known.

 Language: English.

ACUSG

 A disk magazine that came from a London Atari ST user group. At least 2 issues 
are  known to have come out,  but they probably ceased existing after Volume  1 
Issue 2.  Articles were tiny (displayed in dialog boxes,  for crying out loud), 
and accent was put on programs that could be run from the shell. The last known 
issue (i.e. Volume 1 Issue 2) was released in June 1987.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one that was, let's face it, bad.
 Latest known issue: Not certain; probably Volume 1 Issue 2.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

Admirables Mag

 A Finnish disk magazine with a demo'n'hacking atmosphere.  Nice music (some of 
it ripped),  nice demos,  nice graphics. Quite a lot of stuff is offered, among 
which also quite a load of articles.  The editor seems to be Claff Moron of the 
Admirables.  This may (hopefully) not be his real name (no offence intended  if 
it is!).
 It  is very confusing in all to know that this seems also to be the name of  a 
French magazine that was born dead,  again with Claff Moron in it?!?  Not  even 
someone  connected  with  this  magazine seemed to  be  able  to  explain  this 
satisfactorily. Maybe I'm just stupid.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one. Quite slow.
 Latest known issue: Number 3.
 Address: Kotimaenkuja 4, 27230 Lappi TL, Finland.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.

Amateur Computerist, The

 A sortof regular computer magazine,  covering all sorts of different computer-
related subjects.  Starting with Volume 4 numbers 2/3, it's become available in 
electronic form instead of the usual paper-only one.  It's an American magazine 
edited by Ronda Hauben and is mostly devoted to Internet-related subjects.  Not 
a real computer magazine in general, despite its name.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Volume 5 Issue 3/4 (summer/fall 1993).

 Language: English.

Amazine

 A  disk magazine that used to be made by the demo coders Mad Vision (who  seem 
to be French,  Belgian and English).  User interface used to consist of a  menu 
where you could type the number of the article you want to read.  Later  issues 
had  a mouse-driven menu.  Quality of English varies considerably depending  on 
who  authored a particular article.  Loads of humour (BBS and  internet-sourced 
material).  Strictly  Underground  and  probably fairly  illegal.  One  of  its 
earliest  issues  was  reportedly sent  to  F.A.S.T.  (the  Federation  Against 
Software Theft) by MicroMart.  Very odd. In January 1993 Mad Vision left the ST 
scene and the magazine was taken over by the Hemorhoids.
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 4.
 Address: Used to be Mad Vision W.H.Q., BP 19, B-4030 Grivegnee 1, Belgium.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.

Armadillo Culture

 An ASCII Internet magazine, described as "the excremeditation of a hyperactive 
Armadillo's  opinions,  and other stuff." Sounds really  interesting,  not?  It 
contains  stuff about music,  books,  stories,  the works.  The lyout is a  bit 
chaotic,  which is a bit of a bummer because that's the only thing aesthetic an 
on-line magazine can offer.
 Status: Public domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Issue 6.
 Address: 2857 Foxmill Rd.. Herndon, VA 22071, USA. Email sokay@mitre.org.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.

Atari Digest

 These  are messages and discussions taken off UseNet and consequently  edited. 
It is primarily focused on American interests,  and a treat for the technically 
interested.  If you have a look at their 'latest issue',  below,  you will  see 
it's a number that suffices to let you know how long they've been going on  and 
at what approximate frequency it appears.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Last documented one is 206. Probably more.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Probably still alive.
 Language: English.

Atari Explorer On-Line

 When,  early  1992,  a magazine called "Z-Net" (Cf.) started working  together 
closely with the regular paper magazine "Atari Explorer", this on-line magazine 
was  founded.  Most of the "Z-Net" staff went to work for this mag  afterwards. 
Around New Year 1992/1993 Ron Kovacs resumed publication of his "Z-Net". "Atari 
Explorer On-Line" went on with a new editor, Travis Guy.
 This magazine,  incidentally,  if often referred to just as 'AEO'. It's sortof 
release  twice per month (though it has been a bit slow of late)  and  contains 
lots  of  hot inside information as far as Atari is  concerned.  They  also  do 
special  extra  dedication issues.  Sometimes they get very big  with  lots  of 
information and renditions of entire Genie Roundtable Convention  stuff.  Quite 
incredible.
 When  you  have  a  subscription to  AEO,  you  automatically  get  the  Atari 
Programmer's Journal,  a somewhat more technical compendium sort of thing  that 
is  released once every few months or so.  This also includes UUencoded  source 
material  at times.  Additionally you also get special  Jaguar-related  issues, 
"AEO News" issues and occasional occurrences of special "CES" issues.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known  issue: Volume  4  Issue  1  (January  16th  1995);   the   Atari 
  Programmer's  Journal latest incarnation is issue 4 (March  31st  1994);  the 
  Jaguar Edition latest issue is #2 (May 27th 1994);  the latest AEO News issue 
  is #4 (June 18th 1994). The latest "CES" issue is "Summer CES 1994".

Atari Power Entertainment Online

 This is a monthly online addition to the "Atari Power Entertainment" magazine. 
It's  about  Lynx and Jaguars,  and I believe the first issue was  released  in 
April 1994.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Issue 3 (July 1994).

Atari Star

 A new disk magazine about which nothing is known except that it's supposed  to 
have  released its first issue on March 30th and that it contains  sections  on 
computer-related  and non-computer-related stuff,  interviews with authors  and 
more. It's probably English.

Atari United!

 Or "AU!". A special preliminary issue was released through STeve's Software at 
the Glendale Atari Show in the US in September.  It offers news, reviews, press 
releases,  program demos, public domain software and any other information that 
might  be  of  interest  to owners of Atari TOS  computers.  It  has  a  custom 
interface  written  by Bry Edewaard and Scott  Ettinger.  Compatible  with  any 
ST/TT/Falcon,  uses any 80-column resolution.  Managing editor is Gordie Meyer. 
It explicitly permits user groups to republish its material provided credits is 
given.  Articles are extensive and well-written,  and bonus archives containing 
ZIP archives filled with goodies are also found on the disks.  All articles are 
in one file that is loaded on startup.
 Status: Commercial (4 issues per year, US$ 4,95 a piece or US$ 16,00 a year).
 User interface: Yes, a custom one that's quite smooth and entirely GEM-driven.

Atari Update

 Another  latecomer to the world of ST disk magazines,  and perhaps a  slightly 
superfluous one.  Articles seem uninspired and don't cover a lot of new ground. 
The  editor is called David Pettifer.  It is said that it merged  with  another 
magazine (which one?) after issue 1.
 Status: Public Domain (originally intended as shareware).
 User interface: Yes, the "NEWSDISK" shell.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1 (August 1994).

Atari Yamaha User (A.Y.U.)

 A bi-monthly specialist disk magazine for users of MIDI,  filled with relevant 
MIDI information and software reviews. It's put together by a guy called Graeme 
and it's supposed to be really excellent.  Doesn't have an own user  interface, 
though  - you have to read the articles from the desktop of using a  text  file 
viewer.
 Status: Licenceware (œ2.50).
 User interface: None.

Athene

 I  have  never seen this on-line magazine.  For sake of  completeness  I  have 
included it here.  Until its 'death' in March 1991 it seemed to focus primarily 
on  fiction,  and  seemed to be quite like "Quanta" (Cf.).  It  was  a  monthly 
publication,  edited by Jim McCabe.  After its death it seems to have gone into 
"InterText" (Cf.).
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface:  No.
 Latest known issue: March 1991, the seventh issue.

 Health: Dead.

Auto-Mation

Bad Subjects

 A magazine (quote) "intended to promote radical thinking and public  education 
about  the  political  implications of everyday life.  We  offer  a  forum  for 
rethinking American 'progressive' or 'leftist' politics.  We invite you to join 
us  and participate in all aspects of Bad Subjects." Topics you might  find  in 
here are "Beverly Hills 90210",  poetry slams, popular music and the culture of 
addiction.

Bite

 This  is supposed to be the follow-up - or reincarnation if you will - of  "ST 
Enthusiasts  Newsletter" (Cf.),  edited by Jake "Caledonia" Bain.  It uses  the 
same shell and the contents are in the same approximate vein,  though with more 
of an accent on stuff taken from the Internet and less featurings of  editorial 
writings. It's stocked solely by Caledonia PD Library, and they produce it too.
 Status: Public Domain? Their PD disks cost œ2.50.
 User interface: Yes, the "STEN" one (Cf.).

BOMBA

The very first Hungarian diskmagazine for Atari ST, its first issue was
released in the spring of 1992. O.M.Dee, a former Atari-enthusiastic used to
be the main-editor. In its very first issue, Greg (one of the COMA founders)
was a member of the editorial too. After a year, Lord Chaos (coder) &
Poseidon (gfx-man) of GanG joined the mag. There was a common BOMBA-COMA
diskmag plan (COMBA or STimes) in the second half of 1993, but this became
just a dream. They had six issues in total. Now deceased...
Status: Public Domain.
User interface: It had one.
Latest known issue: No. 6.
Address: Not important.
Health: R.I.P.

CIP ST

 This  was the magazine of a German user group,  done by editor Ulrich  Veigel. 
The last documented issue that got out was issue 4,  of May 1988.  The  program 
has an own shell which consisted of a large program in which all articles  were 
integrated.  Article loading times, thus, were nonexistent. Loading the program 
took quite long, though (it would, wouldn't it?).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Number 4.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: German.

COMA (COmputer MAgazine)

 The second but now the one and only Hungarian diskmag for Atari ST by the
founder CGD ST (Chris, Greg & Daniel Software Team). The first issue was
released in September of 1992. They had a rival with the BOMBA, but this
competition was very good for the readers - two excellent Atari mags in one
small country! Since then, the COMA Team (staff of the mag) has been just
growing and right now they're working on the next issue for the ST, while
the other half of the group is looking for more & more contacts in Europe,
because the only problem is the articles in the Hungarian language thus
there's just a few readers at all. The only sollution WILL BE a Falcon
version of the COMA in English!!!
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: It has an individual one.
 Latest known issue: Volume 4 Issue 1 (8th issue in total).
