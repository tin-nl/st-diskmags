The title sounds somewhat as an audiobiography or something of a psychological
analyse, well it's pretty close to that.
Like most audiophreaks it started all small with a simple portable radio,
I was still to young to have a turn-table or cassette-player.
Sometimes I could play some records on the turn-table in the livingroom,
it was nothing fancy it had build in amplifier and two (plastic) boxed
speakers.
Then on one day we got a brand new stereo installation, it was a Pioneer
with a tuner, amplifier, cassettedeck and an Erres turn-table.
You can guess who got the old turn-table, yep that was me and i was quite
happy with it !

At that time I had a friend that was totally audio crazy and he was playing
around with amplifiers and other stuff.
His brother had a disco show and we visited him often when he was playing
somewhere close by.
I also cought a bit of the virus and decided (hey was young)to build my
own disco at home.
So some strings of christmass tree lights with a T.L. starter connected to it
where placed in my room to give the flickering disco effects.
At that time I also got a portable stereo radiocassette from my grandpa and i
hooked the thing up with my turn-table, I used it's build in amp. to produce
even louder noise.

Next to the fiddeling with the audio stuff, I also played with electricity,
wire, little lights, connectors, switches and more of that stuff.
So i was constant building on my little home disco show, i obtained some
extra pair of speakers and these where also hooked up with my stereo radio
cassette-turn-table-amplifier thingy.
That same audio-freaked-out friend of myn had some wooden boxes without
speakers lying around and those where(in my eyes) perfect to build my own
loudspeakers system with( these where two way monitor boxes ).
Back home i brutally molested the two(plastic) Philips turn-table boxes
and ripped out the speakers.
The second pair of loudspeakers became also victim of my building mania.
After some work it was finished, each empty box had now two speakers
build in.
It sounded(in my ears) not bad at all, it was better than the old situation.

Looking back on things, it wasn't that strange that it was actually better
because the old Philips where orginally build in plastic boxes !
I had build them in rather thick and heavy wooden boxes instead, resulting
in better sound, instead of plastic sound with a lot of resonance.

After a while we moved to another house and i got a real Midi audiotower
from Philips( hey' i didnt' know better ).
Lucky for me i was smart enough not to accept the lousy cupboard speakers 
that came with the thing.
Instead i choose a pair of Jamo D90 (or something like that) which are always
better than those cupboard Philips speakers.
I decided to also dump the turn-table that came standard with the tower
and replaced it for a Pioneer full-automatic turn-table.  
My little tower also contained a CD player and i was one of the first people
to have one (of my friends that is).
That audio-maniac friend came along and dropped with his eyes closed in
front of my stereo when i played a CD.

The Jamo's where some real bass pumping monsters, so the walls of my rather
small room where trembeling !
Man your young,  you like fat basses and high tones pounding your ears
and that of the neighbours.
My dream(?) at that moment was to buy some Bose speakers when i got money,
little did i know in these days, what for crap Bose really was(and still is)!

Anyway after a while i got fed up with the Philips set and decided to buy
something new.
Because i had not that much money i bought a Pioneer Midi system which
had a slightly better amplifier and cassettedeck.
It had a digital tuner instead of an analog tuner like Philips set and
also a CD player, which had room for two CD's.
I particularly liked the cassettedecks because they where autoreverse.
But after a while the recordings on one of the autoreverse decks got
worse and worse.
So i had to bring the Midi back, lucky for me it happend within the
guarantee period.
The shop where i bought the Pioneer decided to check the thing out, some
guy who was def examined the deck and couldn't hear what was wrong with it.
It was so clear that even my own mother could hear it !!
After some discussions i got them to give me a slightly better Pioneer
Midi set (a class higher)in return, after paying a few bucks extra to them.
I was quiet for a while but........

The time had come for some new speakers, so i headed to the Hi-Fi shop.
I enterd the listening-room and started listening to the speakers in my
price class.
There where a couple of Bose speakers, so the first thing i did was compare
them with the other speakers in the room.
Ohh boy, the Bose thingies turned out to be the worst of them all, even
the Jamo D90's where sounding bad in comparison with the stuff that they
had in the listening-room.
Little did i know about the difference between real Hi-Fi speakers and
cheap crap !

After some hours of intense listening i decided to buy two BNS E14's,
the guy from the shop expected already that i would choose these.
When i came home i hooked them up with my Pioneer tower and was quite
suprised about the sound.
No fat basses anymore and no high sweeking tones anymore, no these speakers
sounded relaxed in comparison with the aggresive Jamo's !
I visited the Hi-Fi more and more and sometimes you could find me there
the whole afternoon.
Me and the guy's from the shops talked a lot about all the different equipment
and i learned more and more.

I read all magazine's and books about the subject and realised what a dumb
fool i was.
How could i be so stupid to think that Bose made good speakers and that
graphic equalizers where actually good to boost up your sound quality.
Most people still think that an amplifier with 100 watts is cool, they
forget however that there is a difference between clean and dirty watts.
Simply said: If you brag about your 100 watts amplifier then realise this 
who would hear 100 watts of harmonic distortion !
Most class A amplifiers won't even get till 50 watts without distortion !
You can hear harmonic distortion in disco's where the amplifiers are
turnded up high, the sound gets unclear ( it's sometimes difficult to
hear because they are playing that loud ).
I heard several demostrations from for instance Bose, they always play
their music loud ( that's to cover up the weaknesses of the speakers ). 

Anyway you can read more about this stuff somewhere in a previous issue
of the D.B.A. magazine.
As I said before i learned a lot in that time.
Now i knew pretty well what to buy and what to avoid, i also had a pretty
good view on the market in that period.
Knowing all this it was time to dump the Pioneer set and buy some better
and loose components.

So i went again to the Hi-Fi shop and me and one of the guys there discussed
about what i could buy best with my limited budget.
I bought a Kenwood KA 550 amplifier, A cassettedeck from Aiwa and a CD
player from Sony(a rather simple one).
The Pioneer turn-table was still in my possession because i still owned
a couple of old records.
Sound became a lot better and the basses got better and the resonance was
almost gone.

I moved again, but this time i had a house of my own (an appartment)
Before i picked places for the furniture I placed two stone pilars in
my room to place the speakers on.
The TV got it's place right in the middle of both pilars, it's very handy
when you hook up the amplifier with the TV set.
You get a better sound and the stone pilars and spikes prevented resonance.
So i got better sound and the neighbours living underneath me didn't have
to hear to much of the bass.

I wanted to have a digital tuner also, so i bought a few months later a
Kenwood KT 2020.
The thing turned out be a worthless piece of plastic, it couldn't keep the
signal with cable input.  
So, I traded tuners with a friend, i got his analog tuner for a couple
of weeks.

The simple Sony CD player was rather bothering me, the thing sounded much
to sharp in the high tones.
There where times that i got headache's after listening to the CD player
to long and on a high volume.
It became time to sell the thing and buy a new one, i decided also to sell the
Kenwood tuner.

After a short study on CD players and listening to several of them, I bought
the Sony CDP 591.
I know it's not a class A CD player but it did beat all the rest beneath
the 300 pounds though( almost two years ago that was ).
First i wanted to buy the most expensive one in the serie but what the
hell do i need all those extra gadets for ??
The Sony CDP 591 had the same DA converter as the more expensive one, so
i saved me some money there.
People always want to buy things with a lot of lights, knobs and a big
display.
Remember you buy a stereo for the SOUND and not for the lights and extra
knobs !
You can buy a Cassettedeck with lots of extra features that cost 200 pounds,
it's impossible to expect from the thing to give you also good quality
recordings.
The alternative however is to buy a Cassettedeck for the same price but
without the special effects, you probably will have better recordings because
the manufacturer has used his efforts to make a good quality deck.

There are many manufacturers that offer these kind of choice's.
My amplifier the KA 550 is a good example, because for the price that
i paided for it you can't find that many others with the same quality sound.
It's one from the so called concept series of amplifiers made by Kenwood,
amps. without gadets but with good sound instead !
Gadets can be fun but after a while you won't use most them anymore !

Back to the story, 
With the loudspeakers standing on stone pilars and with spikes underneath
them i had a pretty good sound.
There was only one important improvement left; OCF cables between the amp.
and the loudspeakers.
After buying the OCF cables, i found that the sound had improved with more
then 20% !

Several friends who visited my home got enthousiast and turned also into
audio phreaks.
Weird thing is that some of them have much better and more expensive audio
equipment then I have these days !
I'm still "stuck" with my old stuff and they turned completly audio nuts
by improving their stereo systems day after day !

Anyway it will take quite a while before i will improve my stuff because
i'm now saving money to buy a SVGA monitor and a case for the Falcon but
when the system is complete i will certainly save for some new speakers !
Till then the old stuff has to do..........
