PRINTING FALCON
~ORGANIC.FIL~

Yep we're back again on the Falcon in GFA Basic. If you are using GFA 
basic version 3.6 TT you won't have that much trouble. But even this 
version isn't without problems. Ever tried to send something to your 
printer with LPRINT or LLIST ???. If you don't, well I can tell you 
one thing, IT DOESN'T WORK. 

So now you know, but what can you/we do about it ??? Do not fear, help 
is near as always. We made you a small listing you can use in your own 
programmes if you are using the printer.

'
nprint("Here stands your text you want to print"+CHR$(13)+CHR$(10))
'
PROCEDURE nprint(s$)   
  LOCAL t%
  FOR t%=1 TO LEN(s$)
    OUT 0,ASC(MID$(s$,t%,1))
  NEXT t%
RETURN
'
Easy enough I would say, but here is still some comment. The procedure
nprint(s$) prints the string you send with it as a parameter. S$ could
be anything you want it to be, but why the CHR$(13) and CHR$(10) ???
Simple the CHR$(13) is a return at the end of the line and CHR$(10) is 
a line feed for the printer. 

This small but helpful routine is now also build in the Magazine in 
the PRINTER OPTIONS. In number 9 it didn't work but we discovered that 
after the release...
