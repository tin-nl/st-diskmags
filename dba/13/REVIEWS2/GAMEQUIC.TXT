---> DYNABUSTERS <---
                   By Scy & Dynacore of The Sirius Cybernetics Corp.  

This is a STE/FALCON game...                              ~MOUSE.BLK~

Dynabusters is the same kind of game like Dynablasters  on 
the  ST,  the  only difference  is,  that  Dynabusters  is 
specially made for the STE/FALCON...

Dynabusters can be played with 6 players at the same time. 
You'll  have to use the 2 ports at the left side  of  your 
Falcon/STe,  only  you've  got to make the  adaptors  your 
self...

OK,  when the game is loaded,  the main-screen appears.  In 
the main-screen you can select:
-The playfield,  That's the field you're going  to play in, 
 because  there  are  blocks  you  can  destroy  with  your 
 dynamite and there are indestructible blocks. Here you can 
 choose the way they are set up in the playfield...
-Players,  Here you can  enter your name and the number  of 
 players...
-How  to play,  in this screen  they explain the rules  and 
 the instructions...
-Credits, The credits and the greetings...
-Start game, to start the game...

The game...
You  must play the game with at least one  friend,  because 
you can't play against the computer.
The rules of the game are simple, there are no rules, just 
kill everyone with your dynamite. The destructible blocks 
often give a item when you blow them up, the items are:
-Flame, at the begin your explosions are reaching 2 blocks 
 far, each time you get a flame, your explosions reach one 
 block more... 
-Dynamite,  at  the  begin you can only lay one  piece  of 
 dynamite,  each  time you get dynamite,  you can lay  one 
 more. 
-Skull, something good,  something bad,  could  be  bigger 
 explosions  or  reversed  controls.  It'  only  takes  60 
 seconds...       
-Bottle,  gives the same effect as the skull, but only for 
 20 seconds...
-Clock, makes you back to normal when you've taken a skull 
 or bottle...

OK, every player starts the game in a different corner and 
blasts  their way through the blocks,  after a while  some 
blocks  that where blown up will come  back  again.  Don't 
think  you  can survive your own  explosion,  because  you 
can't...

Conclusion...
This is a very enjoyable game,  with good  graphics,  sound 
and gameplay.  When you play it with 6 players,  it's real 
fun...

----^> STARBALL <^----                                    ~MOUSE.BLK~
                     By Volume11 Software Development.

This is shareware pinball game for the FALCON, ST/E...

Since  the  Amiga crew Digital Illusions  made  the 
famous  Pinball  Dreams,  the  pinball  simulations 
felt  like  rain out off the air.  Starball  is  the 
first Pinball Dreams type of game I've seen for the 
Falcon and ST/E...

Intro...
The  intro  is  the  credits  screen,  there  is  a 
zooming starfield where the credits plop  in,  onto 
the screen.

Main-screen...

This  is the title screen,  first there  appears  a 
Volume11  logo  where balls  are  floating  around. 
There's  also  a  Starball  logo,   some   general 
information and the highscore table...

The game...
The pinball consists of three different parts...
The  lowest  one  consists  of  a  big  beetle   or 
something  like that and a skull,  witch spits  out 
rocks when you hit him...
The  middle  part  consists of a  border  and  some 
little sprites that are flying in a circle  through 
the screen,  here you have to build a spaceship for 
a bonus screen...
The upper part consists of a head where some  monks 
are  floating  around  and 4  buttons  that  change 
colors when you hit them...

What  is the goal of the game?  Well,  the goal  is 
that  you've got to collect as many points  as  you 
can  by  entering bonus screens  and  getting  some 
special bonuses...

Bonus-screens...
The  bonus-screens  consist  of one  screen  with  a 
theme, they are:
-Eggball,  one egg  consisting of 4 parts,  destroy 
 it with the ball, easy...
-Invaderball,  what do you get when you cross Space 
 Invaders with pinball? Right, Invaderball...
-Arkanoidball,  what  do  you get  when  you  cross 
 Arkanoid with pinball? Right, Arkanoidball...
-Llamaball,  combine  Jeff Minter with pinball  and 
 you  get Llamaball.  Destroy  all the  sheeps  and 
 after that the master llama...
-Secret bonus-screen,  I don't know how to get there 
 and I've  never been there,  so I can't  tell  you 
 anything about it, sorry...
After each bonus-screen you get to see a ledscroller 
which tells you how many points you've made with the 
bonus-screen...

Conclusion...
This is a really good game.  The graphics are cool, 
the   gameplay,   only  the  sound   isn't   really 
fantastic,  because  they use no samples  but  chip 
sound,  but  that only makes the game more  a  ST/E 
game I think...

Lasers and men / Des lasers & des hommes.                 ~MOUSE.BLK~
                                      Version 1.0

OK, here we go!
Lasers  and Men is a Wolfenstein 3D type of  game, 
this version of the game isn't completely finished 
yet, but it's great...

The story...
Two teams,  a blue team and yours, the brown team. 
The 2 teams fight each other till all the  enemies 
are dead.  Your team is the weakest one,  when you 
start with 14 friends there'll be most of the time 
none left till the end. So it's all up to you...

The title screens...
When you start up the game,  first a logo appears, 
I  think  it's the group's name and  after  that a 
picture plops onto the screen with the name of the 
game, Des Lasers & Des Hommes and a human android. 
Press  space to get the info-screen,  it  says  to 
whom  the game is registered,  if it's  registered 
and  some other things,  after that there  is  the 
level selector.  There are only 2 levels,  but  if 
you've registered you get a version with 14 levels. 
After you've picked a level you can choose the size 
of the pixels, it  also says,  that you can better 
play it on a RGB monitor,  but  it also works on a 
Multisync monitor...

The game...
The 2 teams are dumped in a maze,  it's some  sort 
of shelter.  Both teams are split in little groups 
and  are spread all around in the maze.  It  looks 
good, the walls  and the floor are texture mapped,  
the ceiling is still made of rasters.  The sprites 
are  not finished yet,  they only have  heads  and 
their bodies  are just boxes witch shows what they  
are doing.  It's a first-person maze,  so the only 
thing  you  see from your self is the end  of your 
gun.  The sound is good too,  when you open a door 
you hear it going open and when you kill an  enemy 
or friend you hear them say "Ooooh!".

Conclusion...
I  think  it can be a really cool game  when  it's 
finished.  I'm  not going to give numbers for  the 
graphics etc. because it's not completely finished 
yet, but I can tell you one thing, IT'S A GREAT GAME!!!

How to register...
If you want to register the game,  send 50  French 
Francs,  œ10,  20$ or 30DM or more,  because  it's

--Goal!: better with or without the bugs?--               ~MOUSE.BLK~

Sometime ago, I'd  bought Goal!, the "best" 
footie game there is, but as all of you'll 
probably know, the game is full of bugs. There 
came weird lines on the screen when I tried to 
change the names of the players, when I wanted to 
see the match statistics and when I wanted to 
substitute one player for another. It also gave 
bombs when the computer tackled me at the same 
time the ball bounced over the backline. All 
those bugs were very irritating, until I'd send 
my disk back to Virgin. When I got it back in one 
week, all the bugs were removed, but not only the 
bugs, the rasters were also removed, instead of 
rasters there was only a green background and the 
roaring of the crowd when someone gets tackled 
was removed.      

I think that the "unbugged" version isn't a good 
solution to the problem, I'd hoped that they 
could do better, but they were probably to lazy 
to do it better. I hope they'll hire a good 
programming crew for their next footie game, but 
if you still want to exchange your bugged version 
for a unbugged game, send your old disk and some
