Yep, another demo by the French DNT crew, it's the follow up of the Crime
demo from last year.
You can find a review of the Crime demo in this submenu, you will probably
notice that it is described as an avarage demo.
It contains many old effects and a (irritating) looped sample.

But what can we expect of their new demo called Chaos AD ?
One thing can be said about it before we start the review; it's much better
then the Crime demo.

--- BOOTING UP ---

While booting you get the option to turn the internal speaker on/off.
The unpacking and other stuff begins while displaying a drawing of a big 
diskette on the screen.
So, after watching the diskette for half a minute or so, the real fun begins.

A traffic sign comes zooming in with the 'Intel Inside' slogan on it, it seems
that they don't like the Intel slogan.....
At the same time a module starts to play and this will last the whole demo
through.
The sign gets followed up by the usual presenting screens which we usual
incounter in most of the demo's. 
At the end of the introduction sequence the title of the demo appears and 
zooms in.....

--- A WATER PLASMA ---

Before most of the effects is a comment screen, extremly useful for lazy demo
reviewers like myself.
The comment screen introduces a plasma 'water' effect, and indeed, in the
middle of the screen appears a blue plasma effect !
After a few seconds it dissapears again and the next effect comes up.

--- COLOR FIDDELING ---

A white screen with a big DNT logo appears and gets 'filled up' with a color
effect.
It looks like the Intel Inside thingy from Black Scorpion Software.
Quite an easy way to impress people by displaying thousands of colors and
cycle through it.

--- A RUBBER VECTOR ---

First a nice picture comes up and a vertical scrolline gives some info.
After that a big transparent 3D cube comes flying in, the whole thing gets
severely f@cked up by distorting it.
Nice.....

--- SHADE BOBS --

Most demo coders don't seem to get enough of the following effect, as it
appears in almost every demo these days. 
Yeah, it's another shadebob effect, it starts to be boring.....
Anyway, it's at least one of the better shadebobs effects i've seen !
Also nice....

--- FRACTALS ---

3 layers of fractals come on screen and they appear and disappear layer
after layer.
Not really mind boggeling, although they claim everything is in real-time !

Some comments come up (read it yourself).
Then a b/w picture comes disting in and leaves again....

--- DOT TUNNEL ---

A big tunnel made of lots of dots moves on the screen.
It's done before but, I never seen it this spectacular before....
Very cool....

--- TRIDE SINE WAVES ---

Some more dot effects come up after the tunnel.
Also quite fast and nice.
It's a bit sea-sickning, if ya' ask me.......

After all the waves a well drawn pic gets shown and then fades away.

--- TRANSPARENT BALLS ---

Some big balls come on the screen, they look like the effect in the 
Warum demo from Lazer.
But these ones are lightsourced and after a while they begin to bounce !
Cool !

--- 3D OBJECT ---

A 3D object comes up next, it has the shadow effect of the Lazer logo in the
Warum demo or in the Synergy intro of D.B.A. magazine 6 (advert)!
Multiple layers (darker colored) that form the shadow effect.

--- RUBBER BALL ---

This whole demo begins to look like a polished Crime demo.
I get to see a big bouching rubber ball, a much better and bigger version
than the one in Crime.
It still is a good effect though !

--- 3D DNT LOGO ---

A DNT logo gets rotated and moves fast over the screen.

--- THE END SEQUENCE ---

This part is one of the more amazing parts of this demo.
A huge starfield with 7 x 2000 stars is projected behind a vertical scroller.
The usual credits and greeting come scrolling by.
Very impressive starfield.

At the end, the whole thing fades away and a last picture gets displayed 
before I found myself back in the desktop.

--- CONCLUSION ---

This is certainly a better demo then Crime as it contains some really good
things and a module instead of a looped sample.
All parts of the demo are displayed with speed.
