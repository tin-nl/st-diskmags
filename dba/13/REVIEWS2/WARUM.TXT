INTRODUCTION,
-------------

It's been quite a while that I did a big review of a demo but lets make up for
that !
Sometime ago I recieved a new Falcon demo with a letter saying; that the
demo was made to challenge other groups to do better !
Before you make such a claim, you have to be pretty shure that you set 
somekind of quality standard that gives others a run for their money.
You can read in this review if the demo will give the competition a hard time
to beat it.

The demo is actually a dentro which ofcourse means that it will run like a
show without a mainmenu.
Anyway lets start off with a report of the show.........

BOOTING,
--------

After the loading process I get welcomed by a big (horizontal)rotating
"Lazer" logo and module music.
The music unlike earlier tunes is quite good and made by Stax, I said 'unlike
earlier' tunes because in for instance the demo "Plastic Dreams" it is not 
that good.
Anyway they seemed to have made a big improvement in that area and I can
only be happy about that.
But before I start a complete story about module music, I have to continue
with the visual effects of the demo.
As I said before there is first a rotating logo which stops and then zooms
out.
After the zooming part comes a screen that says "Present" which is followed
by the title of the demo, the word "Warum".
This word zooms in and after that it zooms out again.....

Now comes the part that is very hard to discribe for me in English because
it's based on a old Dutch game called: Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
I have no idea what this game is called in English and therefore I will try
and explain it to you.(or is it calles noughts and crosses ?)
Picture the "#" caracter but then a couple of times bigger, well this object
comes rotating in.
In the middle of the screen it stops and the squares get filled with "X" or
with an "O".
The general idea of the actual game is to get three in a row, in this case
however it is done by the computer.
After the computer is finished playing with itself, it has put three circles
vertical in a row.
These circles become bigger and form a couple of transparent circles that
start to rotate.

These circles disappear after a while and a vector object is rising from
the lower border of the monitor.
I get to see a rotating and transforming object which will also like all
the previous effects disappear from my screen.
After this object a new effect is presenting itself in the shape of a 
gliding underground where big vector balls come bouncing towards me.
It's a pretty sight to see and after the invasion of the bounching balls
there is a big 3D object.
It rotates quite fast (if you are used to the ST that is)on the screen.
The rotating stops and a series of effects follows by creating all kind
of figures (you have to see for yourself).

I can clearly feel that I didn't do that much reviews this year because I
forget the names of some of the effects.
Some lines come flying in and form a cube, within the cube there appears a
sphere made of dots.
The ball is the kind made out of "rubber" and it begins to bounce to the sides
of the rotating cube.
The "rubber" effect makes the ball flexible and that creates nice effects.
A little remark about this effect is, that I have the feeling that the cube
hasn't got the right dimensions.
But I could be wrong, it doesn't take away that it is a nice effect !

I also used to know the name of the next effect but as i'm getting older my
brain seems to be mailfunctioning sometimes.
A couple of big circles made of lines rotate and move on the screen which 
causes some nice effects.
I can't stop asking myself why everything in this demo has to rotate !?

Okay, lotsa lines come up and form a tunnel while (ofcourse) rotating.
It's a very nice effect and especially when the greetings also appear in this
screen.
The names of people/groups are shown with the vector tunnel in the 
background.
After the greets it is time for more 3D objects but this time with plasma
fills in them.
It gives a nice effect but it is kind of slow, especially when more then one
object is on screen.

The show is not completly over yet.
No, lots of colored dots make figures on the screen in a mirror style.
The same effect when you draw in the mirror mode in a drawingprogram.
When that is over it seems to be time for the effect that almost every
demo/dentro has......

Guess, what do I mean ??
What,  you haven't got a clue??
It has something to do with colorfiddeling, distortion, rasters and a bucket
full of smelly socks !
Yesss, the good old plasma effect which ofcourse can be made even more 
colorful on the Falcon.
Well after the colorbiking it is time for a new thingy that I haven't seen
before.
It's quite nice, it is somesort of ball that moves over the screen with
shadow effects.
You could say that it looks like somesort of a mega shade bob, very nice.
Next.........

I'm afraid that we reached the end sequence of the dentro(ooaaahhh).
In the middle of the screen you can read those wellknown words " The End ".
Behind these words is a mirror kind of object flying and it comes closer
and closer.
You see what we call snow in it, the stuff that you get on the TV when the
transmission has stopped(or has broke down).
The snowy object fills the whole screen after a while and the credits get
projected on it.

Code and Design : Photon

Music           : Stax
Protracker rout : Chris


CONCLUSION,
-----------

The "Warum" is one of the first decent dentro's on the Falcon with some
good music and some new effects.
It still has to much of a STE demo to me and I hope that in the future we
will get some demo's that show off the real power of the Falcon.
It's logical that there ain't that many highstanding effects in this demo 
because the Falcon isn' completly dug out yet.

All in all it is a nice demo and I hope that this demo will get others from
their asses.
Well as always figures talk the most, so hang on,


CODING   : 7+
GRAPHICS : 7
MUSIC    : 8-

OVERALL  : 8

I'm a bit careful on the figures because we're only at the start of Falcon
demo coding.
There are simply not that many demo's yet to compare with (at the time of
writing that is)
