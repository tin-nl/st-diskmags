        AN INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR OF EVEREST, 
                     by Slimer
-----------------------------------------------------------

 
It's quite a while ago when I received a copy of Everest, 
an excellent text editor by Oliver Schmidt. The program 
works with the 640 x 480 resolution on my new Multiscan 
monitor which made me take a closer look at it. Everest 
turned out to be a simple but genial text editor ! You can 
read more about this program in the review department. 
 
I decided to contact the author of the Everest with a 
request for an interview without registering for the 
program. He turned out to be an okay guy because he replied 
very fast and took also the time to answer my questions 
without being pissed of..... 
 
This was a very positive attitude towards an impundent 
geezer like me, it made me decide to register anyway<grin>!

INTERVIEW, 
 
 
CAN YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOURSELF  
( BIRTHDAY, HOBBY'S OR WORK) ? 
 
Birthday: 10.12.1970 
 
Work: I'm studying physics and maths in Kiel. 
 
 
ARE THERE PARTICULAR PERSONS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MEET IN
YOUR LIFE (WRITERS, ARTISTS OR OTHERS) !? 
 
Favourite writers: Douglas Adams, Stanislav Lem, H.P. 
Lovecraft and many others 
 
Favourite musicians: Edvard Grieg, Robert Schumann,  
Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Helge Schneider  
and many others                      
 
It's not really important to meet one of them. If it would 
be possible, I want to meet the constructor of our world. 

 
IF SO, WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST QUESTION IN YOUR MIND TO  
ASK HIM/HER ? 
 
Why? How does it work? 
 
 
WHICH MUSIC TASTE(S) DO YOU HAVE AND WHAT EQUIPMENT DO YOU 
USE TO PLAY IT WITH !? 
 
Favourite musicians:  s.o. 
 
I have no expensive equipment. 
 
 
WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT COMPUTER SETUP (INCLUDING SOME 
HISTORY, LIKE YOUR FIRST MACHINE) ? 
 
      Computer:        Language:
      
1984  Sinclair ZX81    (BASIC and assembler)
1986  Amstrad CPC 464  (Turbo Pascal and assembler)
1989  Atari Mega ST1   (Turbo/ Pure C and assembler) 
 
Current setup,  
 
Mega ST1, 3MB RAM, SM 124 with Overscan, Mag!X (is now 
MagiC!), Megafile 30, Star LC 24-10 
 
 
CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR TRUE AND HONEST OPINION ABOUT THE 
FUTURE OF THE FALCON AND ATARI AS A WHOLE !? 
 
After releasing the ST, Atari has made only mistakes. Now 
they are coming back with the Jaguar. There are no new TOS 
products from Atari. Though the TOS-Atari is my favourite 
computer (It's much better than the slow Macs, the awkward 
Windows and the complicated Unix) it depends on the 
marketing if it has a future or not. If Atari continues  
doing nothing, there will be no future for this hardware 
platform. Why don't they combine the Jaguar and the Falcon? 
 
 
WHICH COMPUTER PROGRAMS DO YOU LIKE TO SEE MORE FOR  
THE FALCON ? 
 
C++, Mathematika, WYSIWYG-word processor with the 
capability to handle mathematic formulas like TeX. 
 
 
WHAT MADE YOU CREATE EVEREST IN THE FIRST PLACE, DID YOU 
FEEL THERE WAS A SHORTAGE OF GOOD WORDPROCESSORS ? 
 
It was ever a challenge for me to program a text editor.  
I even wanted to program a text editor under CP/M on the 
CPC 464, but it didn't work. I started to program Everest 
on the Atari because in 1991 there was no text editor that 
worked under Overscan with the resolution 670x480. 
 
 
IS THERE A FEATURE IN EVEREST THAT YOU ARE PARTICULARLY 
PROUD OF !? 
 
I'm proud of it's plainness, simplicity and clearness. I 
really like the user interface. In combination with 
Selectric its possible to work very fast only with the 
keyboard. 
 
 
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE FALCON SCENE AND THE COMPUTER 
SCENE AS A WHOLE ? 
 
I don't know the Falcon scene.  
 
Computer scene as a whole, 
 
From 1984 to 1994 the computer scene has changed. Today 
it's a big business. There are a lot of commercials (Intel, 
Windows, etc.) and no information. The systems are very big 
and there are a lot of superfluous things. Today the users 
are only consumers. In former times everything was smaller 
and amiable. 
 
 
DO YOU SEE PIRACY AS A THEFT (PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY) ? 
 
It's a theft, but it's not a big crime. It's a bigger crime 
to drive a car and annoy other people with noise and 
exhaust fumes :-)Above all it's prejudical to all the 
users, because no one will develop new programs if nobody 
buys them. 
 
 
COULD YOU SHARE YOUR OPINION ON DISKMAGAZINES WITH US ? 
 
I have never seen a diskmagazine. I think they may be 
interesting. 
 
 
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MENTION TO OUR 
READERS ?  

Stop pollution, ride a bike!     __o

Thanks for your interesting and honest answers.....
