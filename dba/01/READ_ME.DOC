Oke you now have a copy of the first issue of the Disk Busters Association
Diskmagazine. But how do you use, or read it ????

Very very easy, the program is mouse controled. Remember always this:
The left mousebutton is to choose an option or load a textfile....
The right mousebutton is to leave an menu or an option...

The mouse itself moves the little disk( normaly the mousearrow ) to an
option or menu. Well if that ain't simple i don't know it anymore !!

For example: You move the mouse (the little disk) to the block with
             HARDWARE. Then you press the left mousebutton. A Sub block
             will now pop up with some other things to choose. Now
             you can select in this Sub block an item you want to
             read/see/hear. If you choose (example) TRAKMOUSE a loading
             text will appear and the text is loaded into memory. After
             a short time you can read it. There are some other options
             to choose like CHANGE FONT (4 different fonts),PRINT TEXT
             (dump file to printer), PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN. There are
             Also two arrows to scroll up and down.
             If you want to exit the text, simply press the RIGHT mouse
             button anytime, and you will go back to the Sub block.
             To exit the sub block simply press the RIGHT mousebutton 
             again and you're back in the main menu of the magazine.

There are still a few more options, in the Sub block OPTIONS but they
all explain thereselfs. So go on and get reading.
How ???? Well start up the program DBA_MAG.PRG by pressing the icon 
twice fast with the left mousebutton !!!
                 
                        Enjoy yourselfs,
