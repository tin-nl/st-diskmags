DBA ST PARTY
                        Hello ST Freaks,

The D.B.A. will organise a ST Party in November 1991.
All our contacts in the Netherlands will get a invitation very soon.
These invitations will be send to you before 1 november, if you haven't 
received a invitation before that date then contact us !

The location will be kept secret to try and keep people out who are not
welcome at the party( like lamers and bloodsuckers ) !!
This party is not ment to be a copyparty, it is our purpose to swap only
demo's and the rest of PD software like magazines and more of that stuff !
You can also show your coding/gfx/musax skills at this party ! ( For the
people who never visited a ST party, don't forget to bring your own ST
with you !!, otherwise there are not enough computers to work with!! )

If you are no contact of us and you want to visit our party, then write
a nice letter to us and maybe we give you an invitation !
We give only invitations if there is enough room left !


Okay, see ya' soon.............

                        Slimer and Ecto 1
