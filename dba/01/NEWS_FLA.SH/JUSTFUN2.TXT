JUST FUN PART B

Where is the Just Fun part b demo disk ????

Well yeah if you have part a of the Just Fun demo you will know that we
would make part B, and release it in august. But you know thing never
seem to work out as they should, so this is no exeption. Because
of this magazine the Just Fun Part B will be out later. How much later ?
I (Bonus) have know idea, because if this magazine is good and we have
to read/write many letters or make many calls, then you never know.
If it has just as many response as the Just Fun demo, well then there
will be almost no time left to do something else...

But one thing is for sure, there will be a part B and i can already
tell you its name "Just Funny", and it will contain for instance a real
good and special copier, a demo with .MOD sound in it, a litte game and
maybe a guest screen. 

Sofar the inside information about the b part of the Just Fun demo.
