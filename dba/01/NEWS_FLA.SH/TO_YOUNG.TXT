NO MILLION FOR YOU

To young for a million.

Well here is something to keep in mind if you want to play for
real money. A boy in Las Vegas tryed his luck on one of the gamble
machine's. And ques what, he won a million dollars, and there was only
one but to the story. He couldn't keep them cause he wasn't old enough
to play on this kind if machine's. And Amarican law say that is you 
haven't reached the age of 21 years then you should not play on these
machine's. So not luck after all, he had to sign a letter in which he
stated not to accept the money.
This isn't the first time a thing like this happends, there was also
a girl who had the same experience. But her parents didn't accept it
and they went to the judge. No luck again the judge said "NO" and even
they didn't get the money.

So keep it in mind if your go out to play on gamble machine...
