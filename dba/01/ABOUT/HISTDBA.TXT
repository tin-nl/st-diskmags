                        History of the D.B.A.

The D.B.A. is a group who is founded some years ago.
In the beginning their where two guys, who where swapping software.
Those two guys decided to form a group( altough one of the two, never saw
the use in this idea).
After a time of trying to think of a good name for the group, the name
Disk Busters popt up !
It was some time later that I extended the name with Association !

Okay, we had a name, but we where only two guys( Slimer and Vigo ).
So, we swapped for a time with only two members.
Then on one day the doorbell did: Riiiinnnggg......I openend the door
and a saw nothing, then a voice from below said: Hi !
Shit....what the f..k is that so I looked down and I saw.....Ecto 1 !
I want to join you he said.......eeehhh okay I said and we where with three
members.

After a while we wanted to make demo's, but non of us was a good coder !
So, we started of with some STOS work( ha ha ha it's funny afterwards) !
I( Slimer ) did some painting and Ecto 1 some STOS coding.
But the coding wasen't good enough for demo standards !
Lucky for us, we did know a G.F.A. coder called Bonus Software.
We asked the guy if he could't teach us some G.F.A. stuff, but it turned
out that he is coding and we still can't code a good demo screen !

We asked if he would join us, in the beginning he wasen't so happy with
the idea.
He also had a friend called K.G.E.(G.F.A., ASM )who was coder too
( he joined also ) !
But he agree'd with the idea and he started with the first demo in G.F.A. !
This demo is called the Batman Classic demo( featuring 10 khz. music from
great quality with a scrolline and level indicators) !
After that he was working on the first D.B.A. demo and when it was finished it
turned out to be a bit better then our STOS demo ( we never released it ) !
The first demo wasen't a big hit, their weren't to much people who liked it,
but their where lesser demo's the ours( hello T.B.W.) !

Then Bonus started at the second D.B.A. demo called the Just Fun demo !
Did he improve or what !!
Yeess, he climbed up to be one of the best G.F.A. coders around( yes one
of the best, we must not forget K.G.E., Overlanders and a view others ) !
The one big shame is that many people compare G.F.A. with Assembler.
It's nice'r to code something in G.F.A. then in ASM.( there is to much 
competition) because G.F.A. has some lesser posibility's !
Better a good G.F.A. demo then a bad Assembler demo !

Look at this great magazine, it's written in G.F.A. !
Doesen't it look great and doesen't it scroll fast !!!

But I must go on with the history of the D.B.A. !
Right where was I......oh yes, I had a good contact in Sweden.
This guy was called Nighthawk and was one of the member of the Incoders.
The same guys who made the Inc.Magazine and some other stuff !
Inc.magazine was a very nice mag. but it diden't survive because of the
fact that they diden't had enough articles !
So, the group split up and Nighthawk joined us, his name is now Mr.Cool.

Mr.Cool decided to go to Holland to visit us(good idea) !
In Holland he had the pleasure of meeting us and.......Ms. Angel( the sister
of Ecto 1) !
Ms. Angel is now writting some stuff for the magazine and we made her also
a member of the D.B.A.( we are one of the view groups with a female member).

We had long conversation's about lots of things and then we came up with
the idea to make a magazine !
We wanted to have a different magazine then the rest( without pulldown 
menu's ) and we had enough people to form a magazine team !
In the days that we where together we also had the ' pleasure ' of meeting
our newest member Fat Jack, who also will work on the magazine !

Mr.Cool left for Sweden, Bonus started working on a text-displayer and the
rest of the guys( and girl ) started to make articles !
This is the final result and I think it's not a bad magazine( for beginners
he he he he) !
By the way, the D.B.A. has also some people who are supporting us and are
not( yet ) members of our Association !
These people are Mr.Yoga and JB-Soft who are members of the magazine team !

That's it for the history stuff, I said enough so bugger off.........
