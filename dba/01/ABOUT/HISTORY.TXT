MAGAZINE HISTORY...


THE HISTORY OF THIS MAGAZINE...

Yeah well an nou and phoe ?????
Its all so long ago, well at least 3 months !!! Well too tell you the 
story, we just can up with the idea on a meeting we had. We were all
cop... programming for the new demo and al of a sudden Slimer said
" Wouldn it be nice to make a diskmagazine once ???". We all stopt hack
ing around on the keys and look to towards him. Especialy me (Bonus)
cause when ever he says something like that i know, i will be the one
to make it work. Well we discust it and we didn't know it for sure then
 and Mr. Cool (former incoder( You know of the Inc.Magazine)) said
that he had the source of the former Inc. Magazine. We could have
used that but i wanted, if we would make a magazine, on new one. One
with a new look, that works good and would be full of suprises.
So Mr. Cool said if i could make a new magazine routine ( of which he
clearly had his doubts by the looks on his face), we would use that...
So after a long talk we all went home, and didn't thought much more of
the magazine. 

Then the 21 juli can around and i was programming again, wenn i thought
back on the talk we had. I started programming on a good routine to make
a new disk magazine, and 24 juli i went with the result to KGE. He looked
very pleased with it. That sunday we went to the D.B.A. HQ in Drachten
to show the result. Well be honest, the reactions there weren't that what
we had hoped for. Why not... because to make this magazine you had to be
good in programming so... We went home and back to the drawing board to
make a new routine. This one wasn't only good it was nasty to programm
to. Boy, we took at least 2 hole days to programm the new structure that
every one of the D.B.A. could use. Then i combined it with the old one
and send a copy to Slimer. Now he was pleased to, he discoverd a little
bug as usual, but now he could use it to....( whaaarrhh very funny, Slimer).

He started writing more and more articles and letters to our contacts that
they should write also and here it is the result of three months hard work.
We really hope you like it. 

You could say that this is the re-start of the Incoders Magazine, but
we didn't want to call it that way. Then there are some people that say
"But we already got a diskmaggie", yeah well that last disk maggie i
had seen was Disk maggie 7.0 from the Lost Boys (still very good) and
then there was nothing anymore. So we took the chance to make a new one.

We hope you will make your articles for us, so we can make this a good
and worthy attempt to be a good diskmagazine...
