NEW STORM SOFTWARE

3 NEW TITLES...

Double Dragon III

After the succes of double dragon I and II there will soon be
part III of the sequel. The release will be ofcourse just before
christmas. It's again time to rescue you girlfriend again (what's
with girls, always wanna be rescued or what ???), this time jaunting
across the world to teach tose bad guys a lesson again and back to
where they belong. There are even some guy's this time that look as
they are not fron this world. Keep a look out for more info in the
next issue...

Big Run

Well is some time ago since we hear from that game, but now it seems
that it will be released soon. The Jaleco coin up will soon be on an 
ST near you. Not many people know thios game, it wasn't a big succes
in the arcade and not on any other machine yet.
What to do here ??? Well tak the wheel of a cool rally car (with the
look of a porsche 911 Gruppe B) burn off your opponents in the quest
to become king of the road (i always tought Scania is the king of the
road ?). It  will  be out  around  january  so  no  christmas  gift.
Hopfully Storm will be taking all the best bits from the arcade machine
and make something worthwhile of the game. More next time

Final blow

Jaw breaking action. A new boxing game will also be released by Storm
and the screen shots we seen look good. Big massieve sprites, some
nice background drawings. as the advert says: fight 10 hardened
contenders each with a shot at fame and fortune, but only one can
become Heavyweigth Champion. Proctect yourself from jawbreaking punches
or you'll end up dumped on the canvas and back in the gutter. Duck,
weave, box clever destroy or be destroyed in this bruising 1 or 2
player eliminator...
