OPINION


Yo ST dudes, thiz is Ecto.  In this corner i am asking you for a 
favour!!  Because there are so much diskmagazines on the ST, this
magazine has to be different as the other ones. It must be really 
better, you know!!  That's why i am asking you for giving me an 
answer on the following questions. You are really helping us with 
doing this, so get your pencil. If you have answered the questions
than send it to us as soon as possible.  Thanks ,   Ecto 1


1.  What do you think of this magazine?
2.  Which corner are you missing?
3.  What do you think of the used fonts?
4.  Which diskmagazines do you also read?
5.  Did you find any bugs? If so, which one(s)?
6.  Which ST do you own? (520/1040ST/STE/mega...etc.)
7.  How does this magazine compare with the other ones?
8.  What do you like/dislike in this magazine?
 
P.S. If you do this for us then we have a little suprise for you !!
