THINGS NOT TO DO DEMO ( BY : ELECTRONIC IMAGES OF INNER CIRCLE. )
-----------------------------------------------------------------

PS: I'am not going to tell you everything what happens in this demo,you
have to see it your self. (GET THIS DEMO, I LOVE THIS ONE.)

The demo runs automatic so you don't have to press the space or return.

                         
                             THE DEMO
                             --------

This demo contains 8 animations. The guy's in the animations are the same guy's
from the game world karate championship.

The demo starts with very good music, followed by the credit's and the
title of the demo.
After this you get to see a nice moving scrolline with a starfield.
The first animation is now loading.


SECOND ANIMATION.
-----------------
In this demo there is a machinegun. ( can you make a suggestion what
will happen in this one ?.) and look what is going to happen when you
guest it right.


FOURTH ANIMATION.
-----------------
Here the man is distroying the monitor, and he will pay for it.


SIXT ANIMATION.
---------------
In this animation the man is going to fight a other guy with a chainsaw 
(this is bloody and i mean really BLOODY.) !!


EIGHT ANIMATION.
----------------
Here is one man holding a flamethrower and the other has a chainsaw.
who will win this one? --( BURN IN HELL.)--  now you now who will.


After the animations there are some more credits and the greetings.

I told you something about 4 animations, these are the greatest of the 
demo. The others are also nice but these are my favourite's.


             THIS DEMO IS BLOODY BLOODY GREAT. GET IT.


The only thing i don't like is the text while there is a animation.
