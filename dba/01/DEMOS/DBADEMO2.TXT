D.B.A. DEMO 2

DBA DEMO 2 "JUST FUN DEMO" ( BY : D.B.A. ).
-------------------------------------------
THIS DEMO IS ABOUT 95% G.F.A. AND ABOUT 5% ASSEMBLER FOR THE PLAYING 
ROUTINE( SAMPLES ) AND LEVEL INDICATORS.

The demo starts with a info screen, here you can read when the demo is 
released and some other info. !

After you hit space you get the loading screen, and the main menu is now
loading.


MAIN MENU.
----------

The main menu is good, we had a lot of good reaction's of people who already
saw our demo.
There is a window called the fieldscanner where you can find the screens of
the demo. You can select the screens with the joystick or numeric keyboard.
You can press the button on the joystick, or the ENTERKEY to load the screen.
There are also level indicators and a scrolline.
I start at the left upper corner with the DIAMOND DIGI DEMO.


DIAMOND DIGI DEMO.
------------------
Here are up and down some parallax scrolling mountain's,and below there is a
level indicator.
This screen is a 10 KHZ digi demo. There is a scrolltext and the word BONUS 
is bounching up and down.
This screen looks like the " who dares screen " in the ultimate gfa demo
by the overlanders( only this time with some digimusic ) !!
For more information about this digi you can read the scrolline in this screen.


BIG SCROLLER.
-------------
There is a disorted background screen, which is hard to read. But try to 
read it  before the big scroll begins. Then you can read it better.
There are some disorted text up and down, and level indicators for the
music. The scrolline starts small and ends big !


D.B.A. INTERVIEW.
-----------------
You can see at some interviews of the members.

Choice of : SLIMER
            VIGO  ( THAT'S ME )
            ECTO 1
            BONUS
            K.G.E.
            MR.COOL

Watch the funny text disapear, when there was a spelling mistake.
There are also level indicaters .

P.S. The new members are not in the demo, because they were not members
then.


JUST BALLS.     ( This is my favourite demo )
-----------
There are 3 different colored balls,it's starts with a view balls and 
after a while there are a lot of balls and they are disapearing in the
middle of the screen.

This screen has nice color combinations.
In the background is the giant distorted D.B.A. name. 
There is also a scrolltext, but the font of this scrolltext is not one of
the best.

The music in this screen is from 7 gates of jambala. 
Keep watching this demo for a while, because there are coming more and
more balls.


COOL SCROLLER.
--------------
This is also a very good looking demo. Again very good color combinations,
and this give's a nice effect.
There are a lot of balls moving on the screen.

And ofcours there is a scrolline, made by our swedish member MR.COOL.
MR.COOL is complaning in the scroll. The scrolline is transparant and it
shows the level indicators on the background !
There is also a disorted D.B.A. logo in this screen.


ACID FUN.     ( Favourite by ECTO 1 and DAD OF IMPACT )
---------
The second 10 KHZ digi sample in the demo.

This is a combination of the Acid fun demo and the Kwack Kwack demo !
The screen's are fading in and out here. It takes a little time before a
other screen appears so wait a while. This screen is purple and has 2 
smiley's bouncing to each other.

 Very funny is the upper scroll and the lower scroll as they work together.


GOING TO PART B.
----------------
With this you can load the second disk when you have it.

It see's if the second disk is put in the drive for loading, when you didn't
put it in you get a message WRONG DISK.
Then you can go back to disk A to the main menu.


THE END.
--------
This is also a info screen, there is also our contact addresses and some
greetings.
