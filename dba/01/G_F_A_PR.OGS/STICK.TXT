GFA JOYSTICK

GFA Joystick,

This time i have made a very easy joystick routine in GFA Basic cause
it seems that many people have trouble with it. In the old GFA Basic
2.xx there was not special STICK command. But luckely in the new V.3,xx
they have tought of it. It s very easy to use once you know how so here
is a litte help. On the disk in the folder G_F_A_PROGS is a file called
STICK.LST. It s the same prg as it is standing below. It only work in
GFA Basic versions 3.00 and up. You can load it by using MERGE. 

It s very easy to use and it s written voor use in MED res but if 
you alter the 80 in 40 it will also work in LOW res.

I hope you understand everything that is standing here, in the next issue
of the magazine i will use this routine again with some nice expacions
to move a spaceship around. We will go on with it, so long until you have
a complete little game in GFA Basic that you can understand. Then it is 
only a small step for you to make your own litte game !!

I hope you will like this, and if you got any suggetions i willbe pleased 
to hear them...  

               Until next time...
