GFA PICTURE READER

Here is another small program, made in gfa. With this little
program you can read/show pictures in to gfa basic. Maybe you can
use it to make your first slide show. On the disk in the folder
G_F_A_PROGS is a file called PIC_READ.LST. You can MERGE it in
any GFA version 3.00 or more.

A picture file from Degas is 32034 bytes big. The first 34 bytes
contain the resolution information and the colors, the other contain
the real picture.

This little program will work in low en in med resolution, it can show
any pi1 or pi2 picture.
the "*.pi2" can be change in a default name as "test.pi2" or
"test.pi1". Fname$ is the name of the picture.
I hope you can use it, but if there are questions well send them in
and maybe we can review the in the next issue...
