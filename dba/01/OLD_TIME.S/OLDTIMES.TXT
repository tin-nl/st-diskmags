BACK TO THE FUTURE

                        Hello old ST users,

Every old ST user who had his computer from the beginning( 1985/86 ) will
remember the first democrews and the demo's that they released.
I talk about democrews like TEX, THE TNT CREW, DELTA FORCE and a view more.

The Exeptions where one of the first crews who launched demo's on the ST.
These first 3 demo's where all music demo's, who demostrated the 
possibility's of the ST ' soundchip '.
This was the beginning of the music revolution.
Mad Max turned out to be a excellent music composer and after a while TEX
released the Big demo( containing 127 musax's) !!
In this Big demo there was also one of the biggest scrolline's made on the
ST( at that time ).
They also released the Amiga sound demo featuring digi music's and a
overscan screen.

Groups like the TNT crew started to make demo's too, containing the first
samples of reasonable quality.
After making a view of these demo's they decided to make the FNIL demo a
very good demo using new programming tricks.
One of the first demo's with a borderroutine, transparant graphics and there
 was also a demo with over 3000 colors on screen while playing some digi sound !
I still love the Love Spy digi demo( one of the best ever made). 

In the Netherlands we had a group called the Dutch Muggers Association.
These guys released a lot of cracks and made some dirty picture show and
animations( Farmsong 1 and 2 ).

The Amazing Cracking Conspiracy was also a group who released some stuff.
These where demo's containing some syntesizer music( sample 1 till who
knows).

The Delta Force from Germany where in the beginning of their career
crackers.
The made intro's for their cracks, later on they quit the cracking stuff
and decided to make only demo's and some other stuff !

Later on we saw the first pictures containing 512 colors.
These pictures where taken from the Amiga with Spectrum 512.
One of the first( good ) shows was the Samantha Fox picture show !

In that time we had games too, do ya' remember..........

Arkanoid, Roadrunner, Defender of the Crown, the Hacker series, Super
Cycle, Flight Simulator 2, Castle, Mach 3, Trailblazer, Sidewalk, Bad
Cat, Thai Boxing, Captain Blood, Boulderdash..........

We also saw the first real magazine on the ST called ST news by Richard
Karsmakers and Stephan Posthuma.
All the magazine's that followed never beat this magazine for years.
There was finally a change when the Lost Boys started maggie......

I must say that where the good old day's, there was still so many to
discover.
Lets quit before I begin to cry and go to my mommy !

                        Slimer.........
