Yo this is the preview section.
In this section i'm reviewing an amplifier, this first time it will be
an amplifier who is very good for a little price !!
The amplifier has a price from around the 500 Guilders !
It's an older type of amplifier but you can still buy it in HI-FI shops !

I'm talking about the Kenwood KA-550 from the excellent concept serie !
This is a serie of amplifiers and other components like CD-players and
tuners that was made only for music !!
So, no shows of lights, spectrum analysers, equalizers and buttons with
no useful function !!
The only Knob and buttons are the Input Selector, Tape Monitor, Volume,
Bass, Treble, Left/Right adjust and the On/Off Button !

The KA-550 blows a 35 W( 8 ohms ) in your room with only 0.08 % harmonic
distortion !
The amplifier is very stable and solid build( Weight(Net) 6.8 Kg )) !
In the amplifier are oxygen free coper windings in the transformator, this
gives the music a clear definition !
There also a source direct option, if you switch it on, the music will
travel a shorter way and will avoid the bass and treble( these will not
function) !!
You will get a better sound quality by using this option !

Kenwood has made a very good amplifier who beats every other amplifier in
his class.
This amplifier is even better then some 800 guilder amplifiers except for
the N.A.D. 3225 !

The sound is clear and high, but never too high !
If you are searching for a good amplifier with good sound and you have
not enough money to buy something very expensive then this is definitly
one of the best options !!!

Now for some specifations...........

Maximum continous Power Output(DIN) 1 Khz at 4 ohms...........52 + 52 W
Maximum continous Power Output(DIN) 1 Khz at 8 ohms...........41 + 41 W

Total Harmonic Distortion at 8 ohms
(20 Hz-20.000 Hz, 8 ohms).....................................0.08 %
(1 Khz, 8 ohms)..............................................0.009 %
