I didn't know Texas very well, but I had the CD from a friend of mine.
The music on this CD is very good( some sort of country/rock music)and so
is the recording quality of this CD.
This CD has a lot of acoustic guitar work on it, so check it out !!
I discovered a view (little) hits on the CD like: I Don't Want a Lover,
Prayer for You and Faith.
This is a real cool group who makes very good music.

CD Name:      The Very Best Of Supertramp
Artist/Group: Supertramp

This group is already somewhat of a legend in the music history.
On the CD you will find all the hits of the group and 3 bonus tracks.
Hits like: School, Breakfast in America, Give a Little Bit, Dreamer and
lots of others !!
I must say that the recordings are good and quite loud.
This one is definitly a very good CD, so go to your CD shop and listen

CD Name:      Anthology 2 CDs
Artist/Group: Deep Purple

Here are some real rock legends, one of the pioneers of the modern rock
today( 1968 till 1974 ) !
The two Cds consists of all the hits and best stuff Deep Purple ever
made.
For people who like good( the best ) guitar work this is the CD to buy !
Deep Purple was a heavy rock(sometimes metal like ) music band.
You probably know the songs: Child of Time, Smoke on the Water and Hush !
Richie Blackmore is one of the best guitar players I know !!
This CD is one of my favourite ones and you just have to listen to this
great masterpiece.

be sorry for buying it.

review it anyway.
The CD has the two hits on it: Fast Car and Talkin Bout A Revolution.

This album is cool, but a lot of songs have the same kind of tunes.
The guitar used on this album has a very specific kind of sound.
Elvis Costello is also playing on this CD, there is a great track
called king of the Hill who also features Tom Petty !
Some of the tracks on the CD are: Car Phone, If we never meet again and
