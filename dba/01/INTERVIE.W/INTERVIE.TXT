Hey guys, this is Ms. Angel. Now i will have an interview with Ecto 1.
I'll ask him some questions, so you can read who he really is. Maybe 
there are things you think "I did not know he is such a boy...!!??".
You thought he was a little bit foolish or something? Maybe he can
safe his image a little bit now?
So, go on and read it then!! ( Yeah, i knew you were a curious guy!!)


* Tell me about your life.

- Well, my life is not that interesting,but i will try to say something
  about myself. I am 20 (!) years old, but i look like 17. (sometimes
  that's fun, you know!). I have just finished the secondary school.
  (with result!!). Next year ('92) i must join the army (the airforce).
  After that i will try to get a full-time job. My hobbies are popmusic,
  movies and computers. I have been a paperboy for about 5 years (Try to 
  beat this!)  
  
* Which future plans you have for DBA ?

- I think DBA will get the biggest dutch computergroup still alive !
  We will go on till DBA Demo 25 and DBA Maggie 100 (or more, if we
  still have fun !) Our demo's will be as famous as " The Union ".

* What do you think of DBA ?

- DBA is a great computergroup to join. I should not think of joining
  another group! All members are very strange, but that's what i like!

* Which plans you have for future in your personal live ?

- I will get married wenn i am 40 , yes fourty , life is starting 
  wenn you are 40!! Let's have some fun in the meanwhile !! Unfortunately
  i have to become a job, otherwise i am broke !! ....No, working isn't
  that bad! ( I am not that lazy, you know! )

* How do you think about girls/women ?

- Thank you GOD, for creating a woman!! What do you have to do without 
  them? .....women?....Well, you must learn it on an old bike!!

* What's very important for you in live?

- Well, it is easy to have some money!! A nice woman next to me
  in bed is also very nice!!! nice food every evening !!

* When you win $100,000 what will you do with it?

- I will buy an Atari TT  with a color-photocopy-laserprinter, an A4
  monitor, a big house with swimming pool, a big limousine with TV etc.
  ........Oh no, the money is gone, i am broke again!!!

* What in the world holds you very busy?

- Well, AIDS is a big problem. I hope not to get it! (i make love SAFE,
  you should do it too !!) cancer is also a big problem.

* What's the stupid words you have ever heard of someone?

- Join CSL !! (What!!!!!, i prefer suicide !!!)

* At last, maybe you want to say something to another member of DBA ? 

- Good luck with your new appartement Slimer!! (But our one is still
  more beautiful then yours !!!)( just bugger off, Slimer !!)
  (by the way, for all readers who did not know: I and Ms Angel are
  living together at the moment.)


Well, this was my interview with Ecto 1. In the next DBA Magazine i will 
try to interview another member of our group. So, have your minds about
Ecto changed after this interview or what? Is he silly or not? Judge
yourself!!

Greetings, and maybe see you later,

Ms. Angel
