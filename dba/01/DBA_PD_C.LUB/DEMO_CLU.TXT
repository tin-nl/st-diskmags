D.B.A. DEMO CLUB

                        Hello demofreaks,

Do you want to swap demo's/music's/fonts then contact us.
We have over the 250 disks of demo's and other stuff !
So, if ya have some of this software yourself, than send me
a list of your demos and i will see if we can swap. I hope
so, because Vigo is collecting all demos!!! (also if they
are shit!!) What the heck am i talking about??? Yes, the DBA 
also has a Demo Club !!! By the way, have you already seen
our own demos? ......NO ???? You bloody LAMER, you don't have
good swapping contacts, because our demos are spread all over 
the world!! But there is a second chance for you!! Contact me:

DBA Demo Club
P.o.box 506

( Send me 2 disks for this demo called : DBA Demo II "Just Fun"
part A, and B  if it is finished already.  You may also send me
your PD softwarelist if ya think you can swap! ) 

So, all ST freaks out there, send me your own demos/fonts/modules/
musax/sources(GFA and ASM) /grafix and all other stuff we can use!
When you send me your demo, Vigo will review it in a next issue of the 
DBA magazine ( if there is enough space left in the demo corner! )

Well, i am looking forward to heavy demos in our p.o.box !!! See ya
later on one of our ST party's. (maybe you will get invited)

Greetings from Ecto 1 and the rest of DBA !!
