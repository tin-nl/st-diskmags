STOS BEGINNERS

               Starting with STOS-BASIC

  First something about the use of STOS. STOS is quite a good
beginners package. Starting with STOS will give you a lot of
fun while learning basic, but cracks should not even try it,
it is wasting your time. So this column is for real starters.

  There are four official versions of the STOS-package, and
they are a little bit different, so we start with 2.6. Other
versions can give some problems when you try my examples.

  The best way to start STOS is to use its auto start possibility,
so just put the language disk in drive A and push your computer
on. (The programs we are going to explore need color so you
have to use a color monitor or TV.) After a while cursor and
a strange mouse arrow will appear. STOS doesn't use GEM ,so it 
makes its own surroundings. You will so be familiar with these
typical STOS surroundings. Now just put the DBA-magazine disk
in drive A and type:
  mode 0:load"pic.NEO"
Then press Return.

  Quite a lady will appear. We are going to use her developing
two ART accessories for STOS called ART and SLIDE. But first
we have to become a bit familiar with STOS. You saw that STOS
will load a picture with load and its filename. Mode 0 changes
STOS in low resolution . Now try:
  mode 0:load"pic.PI1"

  Again STOS won't have any problems loading another picture.
Now we will type our fist STOS-program. First push the undo
button twice, then type mode 0 again when you are using a TV.
The larger font from mode 0 works more easily on TV. Then we
type the following program:

  10 mode0 
  20 cls
  30 load"pic.NEO"
  40 wait key
  50 default
  60 end

Run this program by typing run and pressing return afterwards.
This little program will load the first picture again. By pressing
a key the picture will disappear. We are going to save our
little program on a blank disk. Put a blank formatted disk in
drive A. Then click fsave in the top window. Type test.bas and
return.

Now type new (or new:mode0 for TV users) and try loading the
program by clicking fload.

Now type  accload"test"  with the same disk still in the drive.
Then we press the help button and a special menu appears. Press
F1 and our test program will start again. It now uses an accessory
place and will no affect the program in the basic memory. Press
a key and you are in the basic memory again! Try  run  again and
your program will run. Type new and it won't, but the program,
behind help and F1 is still there. On the magazine disk is a little
program called  "gost.bas". Load this program by clicking fload
and run it then stop it by pressing control C and two times undo.
Now we try the program behind help and F1 again. It still works.

There is a map called "stosbas" on this magazine disk. You will
find the following program in that map. It is called MENU1.BAS.
Load it with fload so we can get a closer look at it:
 

100 key off : cls : hide on : curs off 
110 if mode=2 then end 
120 mode 0
130 menu$ (1)=" TEST "
140 menu$ (1,1)=" load picture "
145 menu on : show on 
150 rem -----------------------------
160 rem           MAIN LOOP
170 rem -----------------------------
180 curs off : on menu on 
190 on menu goto 240
200 goto 180
210 rem -----------------------------
220 rem            ROUTE 1
230 rem -----------------------------
240 B=mnbar : S=mnselect
250 if S=1 then gosub 310
260 menu on : show on 
270 goto 180
280 rem -----------------------------
290 rem          SUB LOAD
300 rem -----------------------------
310 curs off 
320 show on 
330 rem -----------
340 F$=file select$("*.PI1","Load a Picture.")
350 load F$
360 wait key 
370 return 


Well,  this was the first part of this STOS beginners corner.
See you later in the next issue of this great magazine with the
second part of this corner.

(by the way, if you already are a STOS programmer, than contact
 me and maybe we can learn something of eachother and swap some
 STOS sources. Contact Ecto 1 and he will tell you my address ! )
