ATARI TT030

ATARI TT030 a real powerhouse,

At the dusseldorf Messe also were lots of the new and now final
version of the Atari TT. It's a great machine. The 32 Mhz 32- bit
Motoola MC 68030 and the mathematic coprocessor MC 68882 gives the
Atari TT more then enough power for things like CAD, picture proces-
sing and Desktop Publishing. 

Its up to 26 Mb expanable main memory and the internal harddisk with
50 Mb or 80 Mb can manage large amounts of data. It's very easy to 
connect the TT to external devices: it's ACSi and SCSI ports allow
additional storage media; it's four serial ports, the parallel and 
the LAN port connect to printers and other computers
It's MIDI interfaces make the TT feel at home in the music area, and
it's VME board opens the world of scienctific applications.

There are six screen resolutions, and thjere is the 8 bit PCM stereo !!
sound.

It sure looks good, and it said that the software from the ST series
also runs on the TT. I am sorry to say, but lot's of programms we
tested sofar didn't work. Mainly because the programmers of these
programms use special addresses in the ST, and on a TT these addresse
have got some new places. So if you want to buy an TT to work with
a special program that now works on your ST, please go to your
dealer and test the program if it works. Lot's of firms now make
special version of their programs to work with the TT, so if your
program doesn't work check if there is an update of it.

I hope you can use this information, and here is yet something else...
If you find that the TT is to expencieve, try an MEGA STE, it run on
8 Mhz and 16 Mhz !!!!. Some programs work good on an STE and not on an
TT. So think about it.
