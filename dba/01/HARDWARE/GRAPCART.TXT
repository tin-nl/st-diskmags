SPECIAL GRAPHIC CART

Mat screen C32, the module graphiccart.

The C32 matscreen is a graphiccart that is build up from several
small carts. So this time you don't have to buy things you don't
want to use (yet). There is a basic model to make the first jump
into the system easy. Later on you can build it as expancieve and
big as you want (and can afford). The spectrum of 640 x 400 until
800 x 600 in 256 colors or 1280 x 960 in 16 colors, or even 1664 x
1200 in mono will confince you.

* For the VME slot on the TT there is the new C32-VME made.
  There is 1 Mb RAM with EG and it can be used for Mono with 110Mhz
  or 160 Mhz with analog or ECL monitors.
* The C32-ST is the basic version with 256 Kb DRAM onboard and kann be
  used in an Atari Mega ST. You also can use it on an TT but then you
  will need an adaptor.
* 512 Kb RAM can be obtained by putting in 256 Kb memeory modules.
* The 1 Mb RAm option supply's you enough memory to make hardware windows
  The 1 Mb module will contain the hole 1Mb memory from the ST.
* The EG option (Erweiterte Grafik or Expanded Graphic) works on a
  pixeltact time of 50 Mhz for high resolutions or higher monitor freq.
  You can only use it if you have 1 Mb or more. An even futher 110 Mhz
  tactfreq. will give you the option mono 1280 x 960 for ECL monitors.
* Super mono will be avaiable by a 160 Mhz EG.
* 256 greytinges kann be made with an 8 bit pallette.
* Optional is an Mathematic processor MC 68881.
* Something really fantastic: Real 3-d pictures with a special "shutter
  glasses".
* The videocompatible resolution of 768 x 576 on 14 Mhz and 50 Hz inter-
  laced is possible with 16 colors and 256 Kb RAm or with 256 colors
  with 512 Kb or more.
* The Genlock option makes it possible to make combinations of video
  and computergraphics.
* Because of the use of the 82786 from Intel these carts are almost
  universal usable. It supports different resolutions (video to High res)
  uses from 1 bit to 8 bits per pixel and it has very fast graphicfunc-
  tions, hardware windows and zoom options. The pixelfreq. is selectable
  from 14,25 and 28 Mhz to optional 50, 110 or 160 Mhz.
* All these functions are selectable in software, so no dipswiching.
* All GEM programms you already use are also working with the new
  VDI driver. The ST must have a blitter and a TOS version 1.4 and up.

So here is a lot of info for ower CAD an Graphic people among use.
I am sorry but i couldn't get any prices yet...
