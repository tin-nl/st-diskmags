Well what have we here? It seems like that the ST world once more have
recieved a new magazine. So now when the D.B.A have started a mag I'll
hope it will survive at least as long as the mag I was writing for in
the past (InC Magazine). The name is Mr Cool and I'm from Sweden for you
guys that dident already knew that. Sweden, yes that lovely country in the
northern part of Europe. This little country have created great groups 
like SYNC, TCB and a lot of other's! Lets drop that Swedish crap and now
over to the mag once more! As always I must say to all of you people 
out there that like all other mags we are in a big need of articles to
survive so pleeeeease grab a pencil and start writing to us at one of 
these addresses or all!
