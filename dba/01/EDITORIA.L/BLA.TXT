SENDING ARTICLES...

Welcome to the editorial part...

So if you are reading this you probably want to send us something like
pictures or text. Well okay we love it, great idea it will only help to make
this magazine bigger and better. But before you make a wild start on making  
something here are some things you have to know:


- If you want to write an text or doc to us write it in Tempus or in just an
  ed.ttp, please check if the ASCII mode is on if you use 1 Word +.
- Don't make the text longer than 500 lines, maybe in the future this will 
  be more. If you really have a good long article make two files of it.
- Use only 76 characters on one line, cause that is the maximum.
- Don't use funny markes as TAB or special codes.
- Put them on disk, not on paper or else we have to type it all in.


- For the pictures: well you can make them in Degas (pi1, pc1,pi2,pc2,pi3 
  and pc3) and in neo chrome/master (Not the 512 colour mode yet).
- You can also make a picture in plain screen dump (32000 bytes).
- Put it or them on disk. 

But if you want to send somthing else like a good piece of music, an home ma
de utility or game or just anything that you programmed and think it's worth
publishing then send it in. But always remember, DON'T SEND PIRATED SOFTWARE
cause we can't use it in the D.B.A.magazine. Everything you made yourself is
okay or if it is really P.D.

If you want you can send more then 1 text or 1 picture, if there is room or 
if they are that good we will place them all. You can send it to the D.B.A.
Headquarters or to Bonus Software it's all the same. If you send a disk make
sure there is enough postage with it to send it back. We will try to copy
the newest D.B.A.magazine on it, so you don't have anything to lose here i
would say. Please write on the disk what the last magazine is you have.

Well what more can i say, get writing or drawing, and remember it don t
have to be about computers or somthing like it. A good film review or a spec
ial comic book, a new hit or album from your favorite group, the best car in 
the world or what ever. If it's good then it gets its place in the Mag.

Well bye now.........         Bonus Software

P.s. this is a special note to all big spenders out there, this magazine is
made on a non profit base, but ofcourse we can't finance all new games or
program's to review. So if you want to make a donation, please be welcome
. Here is also then the special, every game that will be bought from spend
ed money will be a price for you to win in the future competitions. So here
you see; we don't want to keep them for ourselfs.
