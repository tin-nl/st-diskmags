THE NEW MAZDA SENTIA

The Mazda Sentia or the new 929

The old mazda 929 will be available till the end of the year. After that
it will be followed by the bigger 929 called the Sentia. This car is
already being sold in Japan. The car is a five metre long luxury limousine
that will compete with th Honda Legend and the Mitsubishi Sigma.
The new Sentia will have four wheel steering which will help a lot
for a stable roadholding.
Small special: The Sentia has as the old Citroen DS had, fog lights
that turn into a curve. You can see much more coming...
