THE OPEL ASTRA.

THE OPEL ASTRA OR JUST FORMER VAUXHALL???

Opel will soon take the Opel Kadett as we in Europe know it out of
production a replace it with the new Opel Astra. In the U.K. the 
Astra is already well known cause there was no Kadet out there. The
Kadett there is known as a Vauxhall Astra. It's about the same as
the Opel Ascona in Europe and the Vauxhall Chavalier, the same car
just another name.

But will the car be the same ? No way, the whole car looks much better
now. In the inside of the car the dashboard is looking much more round.
The inside space is even bigger as in the old Kadett. The luggage compart
ment is a bit smaller, but it is easy to reach with heavy suitcase.

The driving part is oke, it moves easy, is not noisy and comfortable.
A real sports car, well it aint that for sure, the car is more ment for
comfort then hard driving.
