NEW B.M.W. CABRIO S


TWO NEW CARBIO S FROM GERMANY.

In Germany at B.M.W. they are currently working hard on two new
cabrio s. Both cars will be out next year, probably at the end of the
summer. The new version of the 3 serie cabrio is build on the new
two doors coupe model. You can choose from three different engines,
one with 136 HP 4 cilinder, 150 HP 6 six cilinder or even a 192 HP
6 cilinder.

The second cabrio from B.M.W. is the 850i model. Rumours about a cabrio
were spread a long time ago but in the second halve of 1992 the car will
be a fact. In technical prefomance he will be the same as the closed 850i.
A 300 HP twelve (!!) cilinder engine makes it all possible.
