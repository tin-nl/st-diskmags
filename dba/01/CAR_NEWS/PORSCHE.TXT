THE NEW PORSCHE 968

THE NEW PORSCHE 968, OR THE HOMECOMING OF THE LOST SON...

The newest and latest Porsche is the 968, a step between the powerfull
928 and the 944. The looks really are impressief. The front of the car
looks very much the same as his bigger brothe the 928. The backend is
like his litte brother the 944( or even smaller brother the 924). This
car should do very well.
