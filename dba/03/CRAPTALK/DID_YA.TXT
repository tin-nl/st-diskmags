  fences and animals anymore with his Leopard Tank !?

* Jat Jack is no member anymore of the D.B.A. ?

* The Just Fun Demo part 2 will be an very good (pure) G.F.A. demo !

* It will be released within 3 months !

* But it could be longer( or shorter ) coz' you never know.......

* We are one of the view(!) groups who has an ACTIVE female member !

* I ( Slimer ) almost screwed up this file and lost it ??

* The same think happend with the CD-Review file( somehow the last
  piece of the textfile is missing ).

* Vigo is faster on Vrooom then in his own car.

* There are F-16's spotted looking like flying pencils ??

  can imagine !

* We all do it for free ( hi girls ), so please send us some donations.

* The Only Dutch Corner will be probably dumped, coz' of the fact that we
  seem to be popular in every country except our own ?

* Vigo is the ultimate diskdrive killer( 5 1/4 ) he killed at least three
  different ones ( and he almost destroyed mine too ).
