I don't know but i think i'm happy!! There R so many drastic changes in
my life at tha moment. Ya could just feel it underneeth yar skin. Oke oke, 
i won't hold it back anymore..... here it comes...

--------------------->>>>>>>> I'M IN LOVE <<<<<<<<-----------------------

I met this wonderful girl in the newyear eve! It was just unbelievable hot!
I must admit that i was a bit drunk but not that drunk! Now i will tell ya 
about my little evening...what !!! I hear ya say....cool down man.... it's
going to be interesting!!! " Here goes nothing" (Where have i heard that
before) :

Okay, the day started pretty good. Everething was cool and i made my daily
phonecall to my best friend. ( This guy I call a friend has a NAME !!! It's
Christer ). Okay, we decided after 1 and a half hour ON THA PHONE that we
should go to thiz party which where held for a band nearby. After some 
dopiong and coping ( that means that i relax in front of my stereo and
listen to TECHNO musax ) I went up to my friend's house ( he has a pretty
big house and it's very impressive, and his dad is tha BOSS in Norwegians 
best advertising company)

We had some bottles of beer together with his parents and some other friends
( thiz was about 20.00) and was very ....drunk? No, but nearly....Then we
called a cab and went to the party.

BOOOOOORIIIIIING I hear ya say..........fuck you!!!

When we arrived i met a lot of friends, more friends i didn't know. ( I'm
not trying to brag, but i really do have a lot of friends. When ya R working
on an radio station in tha little speartime i have ya just get a lot of
fans!!! ) Then tha party began. The only thing i remember before 24.00 were
that i drank a lot and i pissed very ofteen. I wonder why ?

Then tha clock striked 12 and everybody went out. My friend were trying to
"pick up" ( just an expression ) a girl but bad luck. And then it happened..
.... there i saw her.....tha most beautiful girl on thiz planet (almost).
I went over to her and asked her name. She answered me in a few seconds. 
She didn't even think....and she said: " Hege ". What a lovely name i thought.

I won't bore ya anymore with my love stories, but i just want ya 2 know that
we danced and kissed and......the rest of tha evening. That was really
something wasn't it!!! And after that day, i have met her every day. We're
going on tha same school so.......

By tha way, we have realised another STE demo. In it's design it is very 
good because it's more like an amiga demo where ya don't have 2 go through
these boring menus, but instead sit back and enjoy tha show. If ya don't 
have our STE demos yet, than please contact  D.B.A.  and they will send it
2 ya. 

Well, let me think wheither i will make an article 4  D.B.A. diskmagazine
issue 4 or not. When i get some time and some inspiration ( and it's that 
tha problem is, how do ya think i wonder...ya just can't sit down and think
that ya should  think, cause nobody knows how to think when they can't 
think of a way to think......errm thiz is getting out of hands, especially 
my hands, cause i don't have any, it's my cat who is typing thiz shit.....
mjaauuuuu!!!)

I think i should be quitting now, cause my eyes is beginning to hurt real
bad.

Rave thiz nation, and critizise tha community !!!!

Techno is Tha cure for sanity !!!!!!
