JOKE

A young student starts work at a well knowen Swansea hostelry and is warned
about the local Deaf Society who take the place over every Monday night.
There is a signal system, one finger for a pint, two fingers for a short,
three for crisps and four for peanuts. The student slow on the up-take, gets
a bit behind towards the end of the night. He then notices some of them
banging their hands and feet and opening and shutting their mouths at an
alarming rate. Very worried by this , he goes out of the back to get the
landlord. He explains the situation to which the landlord exclaims " Oh God,
they've started singing, we'll never get rid of them now."
