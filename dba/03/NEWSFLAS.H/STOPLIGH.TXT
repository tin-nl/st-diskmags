TRAFFIC LIGHT VIRUS.

Is he green or is he red ?????

Funny question it's it. Well in the netherlands, the land where 
everything seems to be possible, the was a problem with the 
traffic light du of a virus. In the city Den Haag there were some 
problems the last few weeks also with the tram siding. All this 
was the cause of a virus in the software from the Vecom 
Equipment. This equipment is installed in many busses and 
tramcars to interface with the traffic lights and counting the 
number of passengers. Well it's rather stupip if the counter says 
the are 100 passengers and when you look around you you are the 
only one sitting in the bus !!. The virus itself was spread over 
a large area of traffic lights en tram siding installations all 
over the city. THe solutions was very simple: No not a virus 
killer as you expect, no just a complete new version of the 
software was made. It was installed with in a day and see no more 
filkkering traffic lights or misnumberd people. As you see not 
only we on the Atari ST have some trouble with weird virusses.
