Hello demofreaks,

Do you want to swap demo's/music's/fonts then contact us. We have over 
350 disks of demo's and other stuff ! So, if ya have some of this software 
yourself, than send us a list of your demo's and i will see if we can swap. 
I hope so, because Vigo is collecting all demo's!!! (also if they are shit!!) 
What the heck am i talking about??? Yes, the DBA also has a Demo Club !!! 
By the way, have you already seen our own demo's? ......NO ???? You bloody 
LAMER, you don't have good swapping contacts, because our demo's are spread 
all over the world!! But there is a second chance for you!! Contact us:

( Send me 2 disks for this demo called : D.B.A. Demo II "Just Fun" part A,
and B if it is finished already. You may also send me your PD softwarelist 
if ya think you can swap! ) 
So, all ST freaks out there, send me your own demo's/fonts/modules/musax/
sources (GFA and ASM) /grafix and all other stuff we can use! When you send
me your demo, Vigo will review it in a next issue of the DBA magazine ( if 
there is enough space left in the demo corner! )Well, i am looking forward 
to heavy demos in our P.O.Box !!! See ya later on one of our ST party's. 
(maybe you will get invited)

Greetings from Vigo and Ecto 1 of the D.B.A.
