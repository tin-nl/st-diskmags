COOL POEMS

Hello! It's time for some romantic nonsens again! From Mr Cool to all
of you people have a nice time with my poems. Laugh, cry or just read
them people! Its just a part of my heart that is stuck in these poems.

I saw her smile, her linguring voice and I wanted to be with her. But 
she is now so far as a women can be from a man! To me it started as
a fun trip and it ended in pain. She was so loveley so pure so clean.
If she just have said those necessary words to me and I wouldn't have 
gone back home. So here I sit in my lonliness crying for times past.
So the only thing that makes me live is that there is a possibility
that I will see her again.

Ohh thou black night you try to suduce me
Ohh thee I want to belong
Ohh thou black suit thou black night
Ohh you forever my treasure
Ohh you shadow you etarnal night
Ohh you destroyer of my life
Without you a life in joy and happiness
With you a life in darkness and pain
Ohh thou pain you me destroy
Ohh I will always belong to you

Hey and another poet was born to walk all over this painful planet.
