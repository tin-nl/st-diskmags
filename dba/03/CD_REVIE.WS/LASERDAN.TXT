THE SYNTHIE REVIEW
                        THE SYNTHIE REVIEW
                        ------------------

Yeah, as a contrast to the metal review, here is a review of the
other kinda music I hear . Let's start :

(first maxi-cd's)

LASERDANCE : COSMO TRON (1989)
Great Tune with great instruments . very good to dance .

LASERDANCE : POWERRUN (not available anymore)
Wonderful rythm and drums . very good to dance, too

LASERDANCE : THE MEGAMIX VOLUME 1 
wonderful maxi including 8 old tracks in one 12 minutes track .
Peter Slaghuis did great remix-work . Very good max-cd, you must
have it as a computer(sound)freak . VEEERY good to dance .
GREAT BONUSSONG : "YOU AND ME"

LASERDANCE : THE MEGAMIX VOLUME 2
including 9 songs in 1 12 minutes megamix . GREEAAAAT, nearly
as good as the first, a little bit softer, but also very good
to dance ...
Very good cd-bonussong (6 minutes) called ELECTRO BASED

LASERDANCE : THE MEGAMIX VOLUME 3
With another 8 songs, but not as good as the others . Not very
good to dance, the rythm canges too hard. Great bonus on cd :
"FALL OF THE WALL" (DDR - Space mix .....)

LASERDANCE : CHANGING TIMES (ALBUM,1990)
The first album from Erik & CO, with 8 very great tunes that
all sound a little the same . The last two songs are too slow
and too ballad-like . Nevertheless a must for fans ...

LASERDANCE : "new cd-album 1991"
I heard it at the shop one time . All songs are too slow and ballads.
Let your fingers away, take the old stuff from them but not the
new ...

KOTO : JABDAH 
The hit from KOTO, actually the best song from KOTO . Typical
KOTO-instruments and rythm. Nevertheless greeeeeat song but not so
good to dance (like all from KOTO) .

KOTO : TIME 
Again a very good song from this group with new instruments .
Now the songs sound nearly as LASERDANCE . Buy it !

KOTO : THE KOTO MIX & JABDAH MEGAMIX
A full 6 minutes remix of JABDAH, overgreat song and a megamix
of their greatest hits so far (JABDAH,VISITORS,CHINESE REVENGE and
JAPANEESE WAR GAME) . Great, if you have JABDAH, you MUST have this
maxi-cd .

KOTO : MASTERPIECES (CD-ALBUM 1990)
All great KOTO-Songs together : TIME,CHINESE REVENGE,JABDAH,JAPANEESE
WARGAME and many more . THIS CD IS A MUST !!!

KOTO : KOTO PLAY SYNTHESIZER HITS
Many Synthesizer Hits played by KOTO with their typical instruments 
ans rythm etc. Great CD if you have the other ones .

this is for LASERDANCE and KOTO . As a computerfreak you should know
this groups, because they make that music that the musicians make on
computers (LAP has converted some KOTO-tunes ...) . There are many
more LASERDANCE maxi's, but most of them are all not available .

Now for a special topic : POPCORN and it's Remixes .

1973 : POPCORN from Gerschon Kingsley and MOOG Synthesizer
       Single with a girl eating (what ! guess !) on the cover.
1980 : POP-CORN from Altranity. Sounds like the original, only
       better quality and better instruments.
1984 : POP CORN special DJ's mix from M & H Band . maxi-Record with
       2 great Remixes in great quality . GREAT !!
1985 : POP CORN from Anarchic System (version originale chantee) with
       nice lyrics (!) . Good
1985 : POPCORN from MISTER K on ORIGINALE OLDIES (France) . Sounds
       extremely like the Original
1986 : POP CORN from MISTER K with another song by the master of it,
       Gerschon Kingsley called 'HEY HEY' . Sounds extremely like the
       Original '73 tune
1988 : THE BEST REMIX ! POPCORN'88 BY TIC ! With guitars and vocals and
       much much more . I have it only on Tape and want it on maxi-cd or
       maxi record . I will pay very good ...
1989 : POPCORN on Synthesizer Greatest Hits . Good remix but bad
       Lead-instrument (too high - BAAAH) .
1990 : POP-CORN on Synthesizer Hit-collection . Not very good .
1990 : POPCORN FRESH HOt MIX 1990 by COBA : GRRRREEEAAAAAT !
       As good as the M&H-Band's remix . GREAT . On the maxi-CD
       is also a great song called PANCAKE (?!?) . BUY IT !
       
Also heard : 3 different modules (SOUNDTRACKER, you know ...)
POPCORN : Good Remix but a little bit boring .
POPCORN 2 : Nice Remix, bad instruments .
POPCORN 3 : Original tune with original bad instruments and a
            wrong refrain . Nice .                                          
   
This is it for POPCORN . Let's text the Synthesizer Samplers :

KOTO : Great quality, new mixes .
DDD Synthesizer Greatest 1-4 : old mixes, old instruments,
       good songs . Good but not Great .
World of Synthesizer Album : Single album with some famous and
       some shit songs . Old mixes (like in 'FILMTHEMES' 1-3)
World of Synthesizer Singles : 1-8 Quite good, but altogether
       too expensive . 9-12 Shit !!!
Synthesizer Greatest (From TV-SHOP) : OOOOLD Mixes and some new
       songs . Too less new songs for toooo much money ...
EURO-DJ Sampler 1-7 : Great ! Actual songs, new mixes and 
       instruments . 
Synthesizer Galaxy : The EURO-DJ 1-7 and more .....
Synthesizer Classics : SHIT !

There were some Synthie-versions from BORN TO BE WILD and other
songs, but they are all not more available, and so i will not
goie you the reviews ...

So People . this is it for the Synthetic Music .
