Another Magazine and another pile of CD's to review............
So lets drop the intro shit and begin with the review crap !

***************************************************************************

Titel       : Van Halen 2
Group/artist: Van Halen
Playing Time: 31:56 ( 10 tracks )

This is an golden oldie, but worth while to review.
The Dutch born brothers Alex and Eddie dicided to form a band in 1974.
In the year 1977 the group was discoverd by some guy's of Warner Bros. and
that was the beginning of a very succesfull career.
In 1978 the first Van Halen album was released and became a best-seller.
One year later the second Album was released, although it wasn't as good as
the first one...... it became also an best-seller.

Everybody that knows Van Halen knows Eddie for his dazzling guitar solo's.
This guy was Best Guitar Player of the Year for a period of five years in
a row( for his work on the Van Halen 2 and the following albums ).
This CD contains two hits: You're No Good and Dance the Night Away.

For people who didn't own this one: it's one of the better albums by
Van Halen.
Personally i still like the first one the most.........

Music Value : 8                      Recording Quality : 7- ( AAD )

Titel       : Objects of Fantasy the music of Pink Floyd
Group/artist: David Palmer and the Royal Philharmonic Orcherstra
Playing Time: 54:23 ( 9 tracks )

Here is something else..........
If you are an Pink Floyd fan check out this version of some very famous
Pink Floyd compositions.
They are all on the CD: Run Like Hell, Another Brick in the Wall, Money,
Wish you where Here and many others.

There seem to be more CD's of Objects of Fantasy with compositions of other
groups/artists.
Maybe you don't know the music from Pink Floyd then this is a nice change
to get used to it.
Have fun...........

Music Value: 9                          Recording Quality: 8 ( DDD )

Titel       : Music from Twin Peaks
Group/artist: Angelo Badalamenti
Playing Time: 49:52 ( 11 tracks )

You all know the serie Twin Peaks( i think you do )and then you probably
know the Twin Peaks Theme too.
Well, you geussed it, all of the music of the serie are on this CD.
Most of the tracks are instrumental, only two tracks have vocals in them.

It's a nice CD with some very nice tunes, but i still like the Twin Peaks
Theme the most.
The CD is AAD and is from an very good quality.
So, Twin Peaks fans......if you want to have it all: buy the CD !
Cool CD.............

Music Value: 8+                         Recording Quality: 8+ ( AAD )

Titel       : Nevermind
Group/artist: Nirvana
Playing Time: 59:23 ( 12 tracks )

Heavy, Good Lyrics, good Melody's...............
The second CD from Nirvana strikes like an Atomic Bomb right in your CD
player.
Already the band Nirvana is more popular then U2 in the beginning of their
career.
This CD seems to be the second one already, but this one finally the break-
trough for the three-man band.

I personally think that Nirvana will loose a lot of their quality and 
atmosphere when playing for thousands of people.
The band is on it's best when playing in pubs/clubs and nightclubs and i
don't believe that an big concert will be as good !

You just must listen to this album and you might be just as suprised as me.
An Very cool CD..........

Music Value: 8+                         Recording Quality: 9- ( AAD )
