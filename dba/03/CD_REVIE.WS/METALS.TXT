BY ROADWARRIOR OF ZODIAC

Yeah guys, I will now take you to the world of metal-music and tell
you the best metal-albums and some news ...
At the End of the Article i will give you a little Review of Metal-
groups that are famous guys and do great work ...

THE BEST METAL ALBUMS :

ZZ-TOP : Afterburner (1984)
Many People say, ZZ-TOP doesn't count as metal, and maybe that's true,
but i think, this one must stand here because it IS a very great album
with 9 very brilliant songs and 1 ballad (I HATE ballads...) .
The Sound is absolutely uncomparisonable to other groups, it's just
ZZ-TOP, cool and hard bluesrock with synthie-inlays (this style is
called electric rock now ...) .
There is no BEST track, they are all genius songs ...

ZZ-TOP : Recycler (1990)
Nearly as good as Afterburner, but without the synthies a straight,
cool and hard bluesrock album from the coolest guys ...
Best tracks are DOUBLEBACK from back to future 3, GIVE IT UP and
BURGER MAN ...

VAN HALEN : For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (F.U.C.K.) (1991)
Great tunes in a great style, that can be heard by pop-freaks without
problems . All in all a great album . Best track is POUNDCAKE

JUDAS PRIEST : the Painkiller (1990)
VEEERY famous title-song and well known by every metal-freak (NOT THRASH,
TRASH,DEATH or anything like that) . The songs all sound a little bit
equal to each other, but once you have heard LEATHER REBEL or PAINKILLER,
you must have the compact disc . GREAT cover with the painkiller sitting
on a motorcycle with circular saws instead of wheels and so on ...
Best tracks are PAINKILLER (by far one of the BEST metal songs in all),
LEATHER REBEL, NIGHT CRAWLER and HELL PATROL .
Ah, by the way : JUDAS PRIEST have NOTHING to do with DEATH METAL and
dont even praise Death or suicide or anything like it ...

MOTORHEAD : 1916 (1991)
This 'OZONE HOSTILE' album is by far the best from MOTORHEAD and has
11 Tracks including 1 ballad, 1 nearly ballad and the rest real good
songs with names like 'Im so bad baby, i don't care...' . the whole
album has a straight style, that is much more harmonic than older
things from MOTORHEAD (e.g. ORGASMATRON) . 
One Song (NIGHTMARE - THE DREAMTIME) is a very surprising one . It
begins with some backward vocals and has the style of a harmless
deathmetal song, but slower,more harmonic and more humanic (HA HA HA).
Although I don't like DEATH-METAL, NIGHTMARE is one of my favorite 
songs . Best tracks are I'M SO BAD..., MAKE MY DAY and a little tribute
to the punk band called the RAMONES .

ALICE COOPER : HEY STOOPID (1991)
This album, in which OZZY and others helped him, Alice sings against
use of drugs, suicide (AGAINST !) and others ...
The titlesong is brilliant, but there are most of the other songs very
slow played (ballads ...) .
Best tracks are HEY STOOPID (YEAH !),LOVE'S A LOADED GUN and FEED MY
FRANKENSTEIN (?!?) .

PRETTY MAIDS : Future World (1987)
The titlesong is a veeeeery cool song, it begins like the
deathstar megademo 1 and goes on in a style, that is unique :
synthies like Europe or ZZ-ZOP
guitars like Judas Priest
Vocals like Running wild or Motorhead 
-> this makes a very dance-able (I mean bangable, sorry ...) and
good style . The other songs are also good, but a little slower
and sound a little like europe in earlier times ....
(available as nice-price 18 marks)

RUNNING WILD : Port Royal (1988)
This is unique. Once you heard CONQUISTADORS you can't forget it .
Such brill vocal hymns and great guitars (simple style) combined
with the typical songs aboud piracy and that stuff . This is the
first real great album from the Metal Pirates . (Before that only
DEATH & GLORY was good).

RUNNING WILD : BLAZON STONE (1991)
BRILLIANT Album, typical Running wild style (great vocal hymns,
guitars absolutely typical) with typical text . Masterpiece on
this album is LITTLE BIG HORN (lost fight at little big horn - i
cannot get that out of my ears) . This time they didn't sing 
about piracy, but about the civil war in the states and the
great massacre at little big horn .

RUNNING WILD : The first years of piracy (1991)
Again the metal pirates in 1991 - a masterpiece of metal sound .
The Songs are all sounding equal to each other, but who cares ?
Come over, get at the 'WALPURGISNIGHT' ...

METALLICA : METALLICA (1991)
GUNS'N ROSES : USE YOUR ILLUSION 1+2 (1991)
Read the DBA MAG 2 for reviews . (Although I don't like
guns'n roses as the reviewer does .)

MEGADETH : Rust in Peace (1990)
What ? MEGADETH ? This is worst SPEEDMETAL, take your fingers away from
it, it doesn't sound a little bit good . Only a VERY GOOD COVER .

IRON MAIDEN : Number of the Beast (???)
I hate Maiden . But the Titlesong is quite great and so it is
written here . Maybe you know one of our old LOD-Intros and the
history about Pfarrer Guggenmoos and '5561 - THE NUMBER OF THE PRIEST'

MOTORHEAD : BEST OF (ROADRUNNER RECORDS, 1991)
WOOOOOW ! This could be the best of them all . Certainly including
'ORGASMATRON' (I am the ONE !), 'EAT THE RICH', 'KILLED BY DEATH'
(silly sense ???) and much LIVE-stuff with things like :
"This song was a great hit for us . I have 30000 copies of it at my
home ....." (LEMMY on a concert) . This is a masterpiece . Get it
or any other BEST OF from MOTORHEAD (there are many,many due to the
fact that different distributors have the rights to produce them.)
or just fuck off .

OZZY OSBOURNE : NO MORE TEARS (1991)
The latest from OZZY is also a real masterpiece . The titlesong is
absolutely brilliant,although it is at some parts nearly a ballad. 
HELLRAISER,ZOMBIE STOMP and AVH are also songs that are worth to
pay the 30 marks for the compact disc .

JUDAS PRIEST : TURBO (1986 (87?))
With TURBO LOVER they had a great song produced on this great cd.
all in all it's fantastic and not too soft . For priest-fans it is
an absolute must due to the fact that this is one of their best
albums ever from Judas Priest.
(Available as nice-price cd for 18 marks)

JUDAS PRIEST : RAM IT DOWN (1988)
GREEEAAAAT ! nearly as great as PAINKILLER is RAM IT DOWN and once
you heard BLOODRED SKY you can't stop singing with it ...
The other songs are also real great so that you must have it ...

DOOBIE BROTHERS : DANGEROUS (Titlesong of 'STONECOLD'-movie,1991) 
Great tune that sounds like ZZ-TOP but played much faster and
harder . If you like ZZ-TOP, you certainly must have it.
(I mean the maxi-cd . The other songs on the album are shitty
 ballads . I don't like them .)

There is many,many,many,many,many,many more to write down here but
it would be a enourmous work to type all in here and I only wanted
to give you a little collection of the best cd's .
Something about the samplers :
The only collection of metal sound is 'METAL DECADE 1-5' from the
german magazine 'METAL HAMMER' . The songs (about 24 pieces on one
double-cd) are well chosen and always hit-tracks from JUDAS PRIEST,
ALICE COOPER, MANOWAR, RUNNING WILD, IRON MAIDEN and more, many more
There are 5 of it, the best is number 5 (1988-1989) with the great 
hits : CONQUISTADORS (RUNNING WILD), RAM IT DOWN (JUDAS PRIEST), 
POISON (ALICE COOPER), CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS (IRON MAIDEN),
CULT OF PERSONALITY (LIVING COLORS) and from others like BRIAN ADAMS,
DORO,LITA FORD (Yeah ! The two 'ladies' in the scene !) and many
more . All in all it is worth it's 40 marks for the double-cd .
There is also a 'BEST OF THE METAL DECADE' cd with the best songs
from the 10 cd's . I don't like it very much, because I would have
chosen other songs for it . But I think, you don't mind that ....

So, here's my little top 20 of the best and well known metal groups :

(In fact this are no REAL charts. just like thay come in my mind .)

GROUP                          ALBUM

1. RUNNING WILD                1. PAINKILLER (J.P.)
2. JUDAS PRIEST                2. BLAZON STONE (R.W.)
3. MOTORHEAD                   3. PORT ROYAL (R.W.)
4. ZZ-TOP                      4. AFTERBURNER (ZZ-TOP)
5. OZZY OSBOURNE               5. HEY STOOPID (ALICE)
6. ALICE COOPER                6. NO MORE TEARS (OZZY)
7. GUNS'N ROSES                7. RAM IT DOWN (J.P.)
8. METALLICA                   8. FIRST YEARS... (R.W.)
9. KISS                        9. 1916 (MOTORHEAD)
10.W.A.S.P.                    10.TURBO (J.P.)
11.MANOWAR                     11.RECYCLER (ZZ-TOP)
12.ANTHRAX                     12.CLAIRVOYANT (MAIDEN)
13.BON JOVI                    13.NUMBER OF THE BEAST (MAIDEN)
14.PRETTY MAIDS                14.RAZORS EDGE (AC/CD)
15.AC/DC                       15.FUTURE WORLD (P.M.)
16.POISON                      16.POUNDCAKE (VAN HALEN)
17.TESTAMENT                   17.TRASH (ALICE)
18.AEROSMITH                   18.ELIMINATOR (ZZ-TOP)
19.LED ZEPPELIN                19.BEST OF (MOTORHEAD)
20.DORO (WITH WARLOCK)         20.ORGASMATRON (MOTORHEAD)


P.S. You may heard from 'TRASH METAL' . This title was originally
not existant . But some time a group called 'BENEDICTION' said :

AT LAST ! Englands answer to massacre 'DEATH METAL' from the cryptic
realms :  ROCK IS DEAD !   POP IS DEAD !   THHRRASSH !!!
---> NUCLEAR BLAST RECORDS ....

So, in fact it is false to call it TRASH METAL (like many do) due to
the fact that it is called THRASH (METAL ?) .

So, people, if many people write me on this article, I will do
more of it (in form of reviews of metal cd's (in  DBA-mags ?)) .
