MAGAZINE HISTORY...


THE HISTORY OF THIS MAGAZINE...

Yeah, well, now and how ?????
It's all so long ago, ( 1 july 1991 ) !!! Well to tell you the 
story, we just came up with the idea on a meeting we had. We where all
cop... programming for the new demo and all of a sudden Slimer said
" Wouldn't it be nice to make a diskmagazine once ???". We all stopt hack-
ing around on the keys and looked towards him. Especialy me (Bonus)
cause when ever he says something like that i know, i will be the one
to make it work. Well we discust it and we didn't know it for sure then.
Mr. Cool (former incoder( You know of the Inc.Magazine)) said
that he had the source of the former Inc. Magazine. We could have
used that but i wanted, if we would make a magazine, a new one. One
with a new look, that works good and would be full of suprises.
So Mr. Cool said if i could make a new magazine routine ( of which he
clearly had his doubts by the looks on his face), we would use that...
So after a long talk we all went home, and didn't thought much more of
the magazine. 

Then the 21 juli came around and i was programming again, wenn i thought
back on the talk we had. I started programming on a good routine to make
a new disk magazine, and 24 juli i went with the result to KGE. He looked
very pleased with it. That sunday we went to the D.B.A. HQ in Drachten
to show the result. Well be honest, the reactions there weren't that what
we had hoped for. Why not... because to make this magazine you had to be
good in programming so... We went home and back to the drawing board to
make a new routine. This one wasn't only good it was nasty to programm
too. Boy, we took at least 2 whole days to programm the new structure that
everyone of the D.B.A. could use. Then i combined it with the old one
and send a copy to Slimer. Now he was pleased too, he discoverd a little
bug as usual, but now he could use it too.....

He started writing more and more articles and letters to our contacts, that
they should write also.So, here it is the result of months of hard work.
We hope you will make your articles for us, so we can make this a good
and worthy attempt to be a good diskmagazine...
