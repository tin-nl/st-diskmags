SHADOWLANDS

Shadowlands from Domark

Hello is there something new under the sun here ???? Well shadows
you always get when the sun is shining, but the Shadowlands that
Domark made are new. Why, cause it's a bit new type of game/view combi
nation. Take Dungeon Master, Captive and Eye of the Beholder take a bit
of the new Gauntlet 3 and here is Shadow lands. It's a role playing game 
with an 3d isometric viewpoint, but we all got used to that a long while
ago (Think of Populous).
The game itself is very standard, you are one of the four characters you
can choose from  and every character has it's own specials. You can
get better and powerful by playing the game and build on the character.
It looks very much like Gauntlet III only difference is that this is a
RPG and has some deeper levels. Levels like dungeons you can only see when
you have lighting, so you will only see it small pieces by small pieces.
It looks good sofar what it will do in the future we will see.
