Well thats the story of Space gun. A large arcade, looking a bit like
Operation Thunderbolt also, with 2 space ray guns op top of it. The arcade
version was released last year by Taito. It also looks a bit like Beast 
Busters from a few months ago, same perspective, same bloody story.
The object of the game is very simple, try to waste a complete alien rase
we never have seen before and believe it or not we rather won't see them 
at all. Well wasting the while your are walking down one of the many halls
isn't that difficult as you see how many weapons you have. But don't shoot
at any thing you see, there are some hostages also to be rescued.
The graphix look nice, looks a bit like the Alien and Aliens movies, large
monsters, slimy old ship, dark halls and colorful monsters. The arcade had
some real big sprites, but sad enough they didn't survied the transfer to 
the 68000 of the ST.
