PARASOL STARS.

Parasol Stars by Ocean.

Here the mix-up of he year. Take a bit of Rainbow Islands, a bit of
the old Bubble Bobble and just any jump and run game and what do you
get: Parasol Stars. It's a game that the arcade lights never has seen
what is a real pity, cause these kind of games always seem to be good
for a hit. But oke, the game is programmed by the Ocean team thereselves.
Many of the graphix seem very well known, Rainbow guy, a bit larger Bubble
(or Bobble), and just some other cute characters.
This time there is no help from any rainbow at all but you have to use
an umbrella ( you know, a thing that keeps you dry when the rain is pooring
down again !!!!). You can smash the little munsters from you back with it
and you can also collect rain drops with it. The more you catch from these
rain drops the more power you get (only thing i ever got was wet clothes)
and when you release them you unleas a huge power burst. 
There are ofcourse in this game the usual hidden screens, bonuses to catch
as well as some secret treats.
Overall again a very nice game, nice graphix, simple gameplay and again
this one could be a hit.
