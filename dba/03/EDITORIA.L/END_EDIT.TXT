                    THE BEST JUST GOT BETTER,

Hello readers, we are on the brink of a new generation of magazine's.
This issue is the second generation of D.B.A. magazine's, coz' the D.B.A.
will inprove and make this the best possible magazine for the ST(e) !

This magazine has a new look and there are some modifications made.
For instance the Rastercolors are gone, the main reasons are the fact
that a lot of people didn't like them and the scrolling goes smoother
without the rastercolors.
There is now soundchip music with digidrums in this Magazine, it's always
better then the normal soundchip stuff !
Why not some module sound you ask.......well this will disrupt the scrolling
and will have a negative effect on the rest of the programm.

Did you like the intro ?? It's the prove that the D.B.A. is not only an G.F.A.
coders group.
We had some reactions like: When do you start programming in ASM ? What's
wrong with G.F.A. basic anyway.
That you can do amazing things in G.F.A. basic will be proved to you in the
second part of the D.B.A. Just Fun Demo( you gone wet your panties ).
For some groups we only belong in scene when you can code an good ASM. 
demo/intro( Do we belong there now or do you want to see the guestscreen for
the Dutch Easter Demo's 1992 before you are convinced ) !

But you have to wait while before you see all those nice things.
I'm very happy that this magazine is finally ready, coz' i did most
of this magazine alone !
The other guys are to busy to help me out, so i treid to get most of the
spelling mistakes out of or own articles and put the whole shit together.
This is the final result and i hope you like this magazine even more then
our previous magazine's.
Have a lot of fun with this third issue of the D.B.A. Magazine, don't forget
to send us your articles/PD/Piccie's !
