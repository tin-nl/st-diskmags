KIDNEY BEAN DEMO


                  The Kidney Bean GFA Demo,

This demo is made is pure G.F.A. without any assembler routine's, except
for the digiplay routine and a tiny gem-loader.
Many different G.F.A. coding groups have supplied geustscreens for this 
mega-demo.
Okay lets start of with the review of this demo.

*************************************************************************

The demo starts with several welcome and info. screens.

1. You get a screen saying: the G.F.A. is still alive.
   If you press the " C "  you get an copy program so that you
   can copy this demo immediatly

2. An info. screen with white text is poping up, telling you about 
   the demo.

3. This screen has an scrolline and a big Kidney Bean logo floating
   over the screen.

*************************************************************************

After these screen's you get finally the Main-Menu.
The Main-Menu has some nice digi-sound and an big field with lotsa doors.
You must control a small ball with the cursor keys and guide it to the
demo-screens that are hidden behind these doors.
But there is also an option ( press F1 ) that will guide you automaticly
trough all the screens in this demo.
I used this option and reviewed all the screens that showed up......

The Vampire Junction by HIFI

A screen with lots a things happening on it.
There are volume indicators in the lower part of the screen and an
scrolltext that changes in number and variation.
In the upper part is an the head of an Vampire with moutains behind it.
Those mountains pop up and disapear and the lower part of the mountains
are distorting.
Also in the screen are tracking sprites and vector graphics saying HIFI
and that sort of stuff.
A nice screen.........

The Autentic demo by the 49 ers.

Also an very cool screen, there are paralax scrolling moutains( looks
much like the Carebears screen in the Union Demo ).
There is an scrolline, volume indicators and 49 ers rolling in the
lower part of the screen.
In the upper part are dots flying around in a waveform and balls scrolling
by in a long row, plus somekind of logo fading in and out.
Also a good screen.........

Amnesia Demo by Teo.

A complete screen with graphics on it is scrolling up.
There is also a scrolline, this screen seems to use hardware scrolling.
Nice.........

Paralaxx Distortion demo by Overlanders.

Lots a rasters and scrollines on screen with a distorting background.
The scrollines also distorting and say, Overlanders need no Assembler.
Very good.........

Genious Demo by Ultimatum.

In this screen are dots moving forming the word T.H.K. .
There are also lots of scrollines scrolling by.
On the background are what seems to be very big lettres saying
T.H.K. scrolling up and down and sometimes left and right.
Trough these lettres you see rasters and further on in the screen the
whole thing will distort.
Very amazing is the speed of this screen.
Very very good screen........

Cyberbrain is Cyberpain by Bonus of the D.B.A.

The screen begins with some tracking sprites( disks ) flying around.
Then there are two scrolline's on both sides of the screen scrolling 
from the bottum to the top.
Over these two scrolline's is blood dripping from the top till the
( guess what ) bottum.
Then lots of scrolline's come bounching over the screen.
Very cool screen ( ofcourse ).....

The Bool Demo by JEFF.

The whole thing starts with an desktop that will automaticly start the
demo after a while of fooling around( keeps you busy while calculating ).
Then the real demo starts with a big bool made of dots fading, bouncing
and floating around over the screen.
There is a scrolline that will change size and will go up and down.
Some figures and other stuff will fade in and out on the rythme of the
muzak.
A real killer...........

The TEX inspiration by AAT

This the TEX Syntex screen in G.F.A..
The demo contains three screens that you can scroll up and down with
the cursor keys.
In the upper screen is a rolling text and an scrolline.
In the middle is a starfield and in the lower part is an distorting
Kidney Bean name.
And last but not least there is the word AAT function like a volume
indicator.
Good screen........

The Bite 10 Demo 2 demo by Zap Creation.

I don't tell you anything about this screen, coz' it's a joke.
So, lets not spoil the fun shall we ?

The Fuzion demo by the 49 ers.

Same kinda screen as the first one. only this time with a big logo
floating around in the upper part of the screen.
No volume indicators and the mountains are changed in something else.
Quite okay........

Mammouth Demo by TNC.

This an multipart screen.
It begins with an presentation screen using rasters and a scrolline.
The second part is a mega-scrolline that bounche's up and down.
Nice.......

The Spotch Demo by Mega 1.

Another multipart screen.

It begins with an presentation screen.
Then there is some loading, and a so-called Psycho Plasma screen pops up.
You get to see lots of colors waving around......
After that you get some sort of animation in which an Alien gets killed.
Shortley after that an other effects screen will show it's self.
This screen is called Vertical Vertigo( Vertical rasters ).
At the end of the trip you get another color(shock) effect.
Also nice.........

*************************************************************************

There is also an reset-screen in this demo.
This screen is called: Beat This and will show a record of balls waving
over your poor colour-screen.
The words Beat This will work as an volume indicator.

*************************************************************************

Don't forget to see the FOUR hidden screen's in this demo.
All in all a nice G.F.A. demo, but it hasn't the style of an
Ultimate G.F.A. demo though.
Well, wait till you see what's in store for you in the next two(!)
G.F.A. demo's called the Just Funnier demo and the Bee Forol demo.

                     See ya' later Alligator

                         Slimer of the D.B.A.
