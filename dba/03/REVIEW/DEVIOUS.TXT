DEVIOUS DESIGN

Devious Design from Image Works

Doc Devious is really a nut case. A genious he is, but completly mad.
He is really trying to, with some help of his latest machine, alter the
most famous culture goods made by humanity in geometric forms(???). Only
one can stop this nutcase and he is called J.J. Maverick.
He now has the task of altering everything back in his normal shape. And
so he now must bring back the geometric formed pieces to the place they
should be. Okay i admit this all sound a bit weird also, but it isn't as 
weird as the plot of this game.
What Image works made here is some kind of puzzel game. The aim of the 
game is: to place back the froms in the right places, in the right pattern
with lots of tactic.
The graphix are okay, sometimes even very nice. Well and the name they have
chosen couldn't be better. It's the kind of game you could get hooked on
but it's difficult to explain here so try it out for yourself...
