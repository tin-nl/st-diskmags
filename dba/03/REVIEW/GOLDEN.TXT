GOLDEN EAGLE

Golden Eagle by Loriciel.

An again there is a dark time ahead of us. In the future the people 
that live on the moon are controlled by a computer that has the
controles over  us by a small inplant in our head. They live in
a large moonbase and so do you, well let's say you play the part of one
of them. But one day you are stroke by lightning an guess what... Yep you
implant malefunctions. He now knows he is the chosen one to get all
pieces together that are spread all of the base from the Goldeen Eagle.
Once they are all toghter freidom is yours (or something like that).

Not a very new idea, but it always seem to work even for Loriciel. It's
a kind of action/adventure game. You walk around the place destroying
droids, robots and other sick people that wander around the place trying
to make live seems senseless. And while you are doing all this you have to
crack a safe once in a while to get another piece of the Golden Eagle. 
Sounds hard to do, well it isn't at all.
The Animation of the figures is nice, the background isn't much special.
The sound, some small beeps as always and as small musix piece. 
The orginal package has a large map of the whole base and a few stickers
you can stick up on places you already found some pieces of the treasure.
It's a nice addition, you won't need to draw maps anymore.
Altogether it's a nice game, something for starters i would say, and only
some small thing could be better.
