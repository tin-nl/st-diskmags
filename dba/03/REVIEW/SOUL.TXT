SOUL CRYSTAL

Soul Crystal from Starbyte Software
(adventure)

Well i think everybody that isn't over 18 yet knows the problem. 
Every year when the big vacations start you think "Great now I 
can do what i want" and most of the time it turns out that you 
have to go where your mom and dad go. They go again to some so 
boring place you can't amuse yourself. Also Dave , the main 
character in this adventure, had the same experience and had 
enough of it. But this year it's the first time he can travel 
alone !!. And where is he going ??, well he found himself a 
legendary lake place somewhere in Scotland. 
The people out there are a bit weird by the first look of things 
and the hotel is special either but the view of the landscape is
great. Especialy the lake, where as the story says a city sonk 
in it. But already during his first swim in the lake he is pushed 
unter water and he awakes in a parralel world surrounded by pass 
word elfs, goblins, magicians etc. And ofcourse Dave is falling 
in the hands of a magician, is forced to sell his sool, and get 
back out of trouble and with his sool.

Well a nice story to start with don't you think. The whole things 
is controlled by mouse and very easy to use. Especialy if you 
use and key and mouse combinations you can get along very fast. 
But even with the mouse and picture guide menu it's a real text 
adventure. To find a difficult word you might not know you can 
always use the mouse to click on it, so you won't be left alone 
with al the trouble. And very difficult input isn't possible.
It's one of the last real text adventures, a sort of programm 
that seems to disappear in the future. All over a nice game if you 
like this kind of games.
