Important information:  The intro on this disk will NOT work on 512 Kb. 
                        MEGA STE OWNERS MUST PRESS "M" to start to avoid
                        the Digi drums cause the routines don't work on
                        the Mega STE. Normal ST and STE users can press 
                        SPACE or any other key to go on.                       
                        Future issue's won't work on 512 Kb machines
                        anymore so go and buy an memory expansion.
 
            Press "M" for MEGA or any other key to start...
