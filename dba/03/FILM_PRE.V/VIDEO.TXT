Title : The Godfather III
Points: 9

This is the third film about the Corleone family in the States. As 
the two first films this movie is really good. Its perhaps not a film
for the action people because it's an very long movie and the story just
floats on. You get a feeling that this is really the big boys that are
playing. The story in short is that Michael Corleone is legalising his
bussines but he runs in a couple of big problems and as useal he 
solves it in a standard Corleone fashion. This movie is a must for 
those who liked the two first Godfather movies.

Title : Dances with wolves
Points: 9

This is Kevin Costners first homemade movie and it was a real success
both in the states and in Europe. It takes out the best and the worst
of the human. It takes out the truth about how the Indians where treated
and it wasn't so very nice I can tell you. The story in shorth is that
this promosing officer starts the movie with going completly nuts. And
after that get himself together and goes out west to see the last
frontier. He falls in love with this white women that was raised with
the Indians and then the adventure begins. It's not your average Indian
movie for ones you can see the life from the Indian's point of view.
