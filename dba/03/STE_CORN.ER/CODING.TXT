   Well, in this article I don't tell you anything miraculous (cause I am
not able to)... I tell you about one new register in STE. This register is
 $ff820e.
   With this register you can tell the computer, how many words you want to
add to width of the line. For example: If you put a value of 80 to $ff820e
(move.w #80,$ff820e), then there will be 80 words "behind" every line.
   So the screen will be twice as big as usually (you, don't see it, but
there it is)... This trick is really good specially when you are making
scrollers. And if you use the hardware-scroller (I'll tell you what it is
in my next assembly-course) at the same time, the scrolling is very, very
fast.
   Hmm, did you get it? I am afraid that I am not so good to explain this
in English... Let's take another example. If you put a value of 4 to this
register ( move.w #4,$ff820e ), there will be 16 pixels in right part of
screen (4 words=16 pixels). Normal line is 80 words wide ($ff820e=0), but
now one line is 84 words wide ($ff820e=4). You can copy a font to this new
area, and no-one will see it.
   All right I give up. Here comes a little example:

     clr.l   -(sp)                   ;Supervisor
     move.w  #$20,-(sp)
     trap    #1
     addq.l  #6,sp

     move.w  #80,$ff820e             ;Now the line is twice as wide as
                                      usually (80+80=160).

     clr.l   -(sp)                   ;Back to Devpac (You use Devpac too?)
     trap    #1

   All right this course was not so good, but I am so tired to write these
articles now. Hope you can understand this anyway...
