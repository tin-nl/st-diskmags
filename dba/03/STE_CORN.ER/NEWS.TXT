NEWS FROM STE-SCENE
                         NEWS FROM STE - WORLD
                         ---------------------

   This article tells you the things that are happening on STE-scene.
STE-News will tell you the latest rumours about demos, games, and groups
on Atari STE.
   First about Finland (that's because I live here)... DES-Q lost their
main-coder, Dark Vader. FLASH lost their digi-specialist, which was called
Executioner. Tolkien from DES-Q joined FLASH. A musician from DES-Q will
soon join FLASH. DES-Q is dead.
   FLASH is making a big demo for STE. It will be released before summer.
Because DES-Q is dead, FLASH is the only existing STE-group in Finland.
   Now for Germany. Sometimes ago we all saw the GCS-Light demo, which was
made by LIGHT. After that they have developed a new 50khz playroutine for
Noisetracker (Leviathan told me, that it is better than the routine in
Audio Sculpture, and I believe him).
   At the moment LIGHT is working hard on their megademo. It will be
released after Christmas (I think). So, prepare for the brain-blasting
experience with great graphics and full stereo-sound.
   That was it, dudes. Next time I hope that I can tell you a lot more
interesting news. If you have news or rumours about STE, please write
them to me. That's the way how you can share them with everyone else in
STE-scene. The address can be found somewhere else in STE-CORNER.
