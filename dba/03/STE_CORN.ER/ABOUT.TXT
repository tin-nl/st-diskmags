ABOUT STE-CORNER
                               ABOUT STE-CORNER

   STE-Corner is a new channel to tell different stories about STE. This
idea was found by Sandman from Flash (it's me). I wrote to DBA (because
they have this nice magazine), and asked if they think that my idea is
useable.
   A couple of days ago I got the answer: they wanted to get these kind of
articles. They have not seen my articles before, but I hope that they like
reading my stories.
   STE-CORNER is not just one article, 'coz I write about assembler, and
I tell you the latest rumours that are happening on STE-scene. So here are
many articles like NEWS , ASSEMBLY and so on...
   It would be too hard to find out these rumours all by myself. So it is
up to you too. If you have heard interesting news or rumours about STE,
then please write to me.
   And of course you can write a whole article by yourself and then publish
it in DBA-maggie (if they accept it).
   It is not only the news that are taken in. If you have found a new way
to use STE's hardware, you can write about it. So there will be more and
more good STE-programmers. And the better coders, the better demos...

PS   Let's hope that these articles will make the future better for STE.
