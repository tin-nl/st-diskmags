LC 24-200 QUICK TEST

Printer test: Star LC 24-200 Dot matrix printer

Hello here is small printer test. The Star LC 24-200 comes in two
series. There is the LC24-200 (black and white), and there is an
Star LC24-200 colour. It is a very big printer (look in the speci-
fications for the sizes). It has a very unusual design, but it is 
a very practical design. It is not so angular as the other 
Star printers.

It is a very fast printer, but it is also a very noisy printer. 
The big printer cap silences the printer a lot, but it is then still
a very noisy  printer. The "Quiet" Mode, helps a lot, but then it doesn't
print as fast. 

The printer has got a system called EDS (Electronik Dip Switches)
This means you can set your printer in the way you want to by just
pressing a few buttons. The printer has got an EPROM - chip for 
the current settings. 

The users manual is very good. It is illustrated, and it is very 
surveyable. It contains a few Basic programs for the printer, and 
of course some character tables. It has some chapters about Trouble-
shooting and maintenance. It has 157 pages. 

The big advantage of working with this printer is: it emulates very 
many printerdrivers. Even in the Epson mode I could print some text with
an IBM - printerdriver. It can even print with printerdrivers for 9-pins
printers.  

The EDS-mode is very conveniently aranged, but it is too complex to 
explain without knowing what the control panel looks like. So I won't
do that. 

It has two self-tests. A long self test, with the current EDS settings,
and the font types. The short self test gives only the character table.

It has a stay in panel pitch mode. This means that software can not 
change the chosen pitch.

It has a stay in panel font mode. This means that software can not 
change the chosen font. 

It has a Hexadecimal dump mode. This is a feature for programmers who
are debugging printing programs and want to see the actual codes 
the printer is receiving.

You can move the paper in any way you want to ( Up and down I mean )
just as you please. 
You can clear the buffer if you want to. This means you can throw away
all the information in the memory of the printer. 



I like using this printer because it is very fast, and I almost never
have to load a special printerdriver. 
I don't know what else to write except for the specifications.
So here they are:
