****************************************************************************

Yoooh guys, here it is: THE interview with Ms.Angel the female member of
the D.B.A. !!
After her interview with me( Slimer ) i wanted to get my revenge.
So, i got it and here are my questions to her.
I treid to make the interview as hard as possible but i dediced at the
last moment that i will keep it somewhat less hard.
One final remark before i begin the interview, the two goldfishes are
in the big bowl in heaven...........

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

1. Can you tell me something about yourself ?

  Of course I'll tell something about my self to you guys. I am born
  in 1969 in hospital in the Netherlands. Now I am 1.65m short. My hair
  is blond (half long) with a few curls and my eyes are blue. In august
  last year, i've got my own appartment and that's really a little
  palace. I have two goldfishes and mister Cool have given them names.
  So what are the names? That's your problem! Further, my hobbies are
  swimming, reading, movie, music, theater, jogging, writing, laughing,
  sing with my choir (we are very very famous you know) and I like 
  serious talks! Oh yes, some people say I am the best in flirting.
  May be it's true.    


2. What do you think about the D.B.A.( honest ) ?

   I am always honest mister Slimer! So D.B.A. is a great computer group.
   Many other people are very jealous at our D.B.A.! I like it a lot when
   there are other guys who want to write some articles for our magazine.
   I hope the members of D.B.A. will be very serious about the work for
   this group.


3. Which plans for the future do you have for your personal life ?

   I hope to have a nice job with nice collegues. And when I will marry,
   my darling should ask me on a very romantic way! So I like to have
   two children. For the rest I hope to have very much luck in my life
   and a really close relationship with my husband.


4. If you have a free day, what do you like to do then ?

   See a good movie or something nice with a close friend of me. And 
   of course give a concert with the choir for example is very nice 
   too! In 1991 we had a concert with Lee Towers & Anita Meyer in
   Thialf Heerenveen in the Netherlands and we where on television
   and radio many times. There are songs of our choir on a CD too!!!    


5. What do you think about computers,
                          
   I don't like computers always because after about one hour my eyes
   do hurt me. Yes honestly!


6. Are there things going on this world that holds you very bussy ?

    I hate cruelty, discrimination, milieu, 3th world problems and lies!


7. What are they most stupid words you ever heard ??

    The stupids words I have ever heard? My mum have given me away for a dog!
   Yes, it was very strange for me to hear something like that. I have only
   thought: strange girl!


8. Can you make a quick description of a view members of the D.B.A. ??
   Just a short description of there personality's, so that we can see if
   they really talk the treuth in there interviews.


  Yes of course I will give a quick discription but it's very difficult
  but I will try it for you!


Vigo    :    hard worker


Ecto    :   little bussines man with many luck
 

Slimer  :  " poor " guy


9. I'm now going to ask you to give me a one postive remark about the 
   caracter of the same members.
   I will not ask negative remarks, coz' you probably won't answer that
   anyway.

Vigo     :  faith to his parents


Ecto 1   :  good boy


Slimer   :  nice, sensitive guy


10. At last, do you want to say something to one of the members of D.B.A. ?

    Of course I want to say something to one of the D.B.A. members! A lot
    of greetings for a nice little friend of me. Vi ses!  I hope you are
    not a little bit jealous mister Slimer.


    Greetings of ms Angel and her two goldfishes!
