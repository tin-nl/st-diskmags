NEO PICTURE LOADER

Oldie but goldie,

YEs weel not many people seem to make there pictures in Neo Chrome 
anymore, but for those that still do. First there is an explemation
of how a picture made in Neo looks like in "normal" words. 
It may be a bit tecnical but is't always nice to know...


1 long   (4  bytes)       resolution (0=Low res, 1=Med res, 2=High res)
16 words (32 bytes)       palette
12 bytes                  filename ("        .   ")
1 byte                    Left color animation limit (starting color number)
1 byte                    Right color animation limit (ending color number)
1 byte                    color rotation speed
1 byte                    color rotation direction
1 long   (4  bytes)       color rotation duration (number of iterations)
18 longs (72 bytes)       reserved for expansion
16000 words (32000 bytes) picture data (screen memory)
-----------
32128 bytes     total


Oke now you have seen what it looks like in technical terms, but now you
want ot see your own picture on screen. This small listing is ofcourse made
again in GFA Basic and you can find it in the folder GFA_PROGS as file
unter the name NEO_LOAD.LST and you may MERGE it in GFA Version 3.xx.
If you want more info about the animation part wrtie to use and maybe 
we will do so in issue 4 ( We must have something left to write about
every issue !!!).


 
OPEN "i",#1,"a:\kid.neo"        ! open picture file...
dummy$=INPUT$(4,#1)             ! skip resolution info...
a$=INPUT$(32,#1)                ! read color info (16 colors)
VOID XBIOS(6,L:VARPTR(a$))      ! setup colors...
dummy$=INPUT$(92,#1)            ! skip animation info 128 bytes (92=128-4-32)
BGET #1,XBIOS(2),32000          ! get the picture info
CLOSE #1                        ! close picture file
VOID INP(2)                     ! get key.


Well and if everything is well you could see (after you run this program
in GFA Basic ofcourse) your own lovely (????) picture. Oke that's it again
see you next time,
