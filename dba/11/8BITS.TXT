Can you still remember those (early) days of the 8 bit computers? Blood 
shot eyes and grinding teeth when your datarecorder messed up again? Single 
sided 5 1/4 disks with low saving capacity and even lower speed? Yes? How come 
that I somehow enjoyed myself more than, then I do today ?   

The answer to that question must surely be that these days everybody owns a 
computer. In the early 8 bit days there was only a small group of users in 
comparison with these days. Everything was new and there was much to be 
discovered. The programs were just great and especially the games knew 
many classics. We were all quite happy with 8 colors and 320 x 200 resolutions 
and great soundchip music. Both the CBM 64 and Atari XL were equipped with 
excellent sound, but the SID of the 64 really was the pith. There are 
still people on the Falcon who want to see a conversion of SID music to their 
machine and have wild ideas that maybe the DSP would do the trick in playing 
them. I don't know if this is possible but if one of you can pull it of, you  
are likely to create some happy people(hint)!  

The music was better and the games were better. Even with the lack of 
devastating graphics and high quality samples the games were somehow more 
appealing. At the end of this paragraph you will find a list of popular 
games that might bring back old memories of forgotten days of joy.

Note to the people who spend their days making Tetris clones and Japanese 
boardgames: Try to convert one of the games above to the Falcon ! B.t.w. 
in the next issue you will find even more names of games, this is not even half 
of it!
