A Network Nightmare by Dennis Wiedman
-------------------------------------

Listen my friend,
I have a tale to tell;
Many of you it,
Ohhhhhhhh so very well.

Late last night, dark and dreary,
As i pondered, weak and weary;
Slaving over a hot keyboard,
There came a tappin' at my door.

"Hark!Who goes there?"
Was my cry.
"Tix me, Betsy, your file server,"
Came the reply.

"What manner of winsome wench you be?"
"I fly at 20 megahertz, fast as could be!"

"I'll be the master,
You be the slave."
Little did I know, she would make me her knave!

Try as I would
With all of my might,
This bruiser of a mama
Sure put up a fight.

"What's the matter, woman?
Give me no jive."
Her only response wa,
"It's not me! Check your disk drive!"

Before the network
Would quickly go under,
I replaced that darned dick drive
That was causing the blunder.

On lesser machines, the drive worked,
Oh, so very well.
But, why Betsy didn't like,
I couldn't tell.

Then there was her friend,
Novell was his name;
He came around the office
To join in our game.

Jerking me this way,
Then jerking me like that;
Boy, those two
Sure put up a spat!

At fast soeed, or at slow speed,
ROMbios or RAM
I could see that our netwrok
Was sure in a jam.

"It's his fault!" she screamed.
"No, It's her fault!" he would yell;
As far as I was concerned,
They both could just go to h---!

I calmed them both down,
I talked with each one;
If I weren't so  darned tired,
It might have been fun.

I talked with Novell,
In him I did confide,
"Let's put you with another girl,
And see what we can find."

The courtship of the two systems was simple,
Their marriage was bliss;
"It's supposed to be this easy; so then,
What did I miss?"

I went back to Betsy,
With a solution to find;
Personally, I thought the ol'girl
Was losing her mind.

"Hey, Betsy, see that file.
That's the one I want you to get."
Her response, however, was puzzling,
Because all she would do...was forget!

"What's the matter, ol'girl,
Pick up a virus or flu?"
"Go away, leave me alone.
By the way...who are you?"

The signs were all there.
It was abundantly clear;
Betsy's oars weren't in the water.
There was nothing between her ears.

File service is a job
You can't givee to a clone;
Betsy's lights were all on,
But no one was home!

I hope you'll forgive me,
Won't think me too much a slug;
But for poor ol' Betsy,
All I could do was pull out the plug.

Betsy was a sly one, tho,
A little to sly, I fear;
She gobbled of few of our files
Before her brian disappeared.

I faced a dilemma,
Just as ol' Betsy bit the dust;
Finding a more permanent mate
For Novell was a must.

Suddenly, there came out a hero
He was dressed all in Big Blue;
If he couldn't help me,
There was nothing I could do.

There he stood with the letters IBM
Emblazoned on his chest;
If anyone could do it,
He'd get us out of this mess.

A speed demon he isn't,
He does things with style and flair;
For now, he'll keep me
From tearing out what's left of my hair.

Funeral services for Betsy
Will be held today at noon;
Lynch mobs will be forming
For Betsy's service bureau real soon.

With respect to service,
We won't need any cash;
As far as I'm concerned,
Betsy's headed for the trash.

There's a moral to this story
It gets right to the core;
When it comes to trouble shooting networks...
This system designer will say, "NEVERMORE!"
