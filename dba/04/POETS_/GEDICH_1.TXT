VERY TOUCHY 1

How strange life can be hey!

I look into your eyes and i see compation. I listen to your voice and
I see happiness. I talk to you and I wonder if I can trust you. I listen
to your laugh I and cry with joy within myself. I try to explain but
my voice is failing me, you wonder what's wrong and I won't talk to
you. You seems to be so innocent and so pure so I won't bother you with
my problems. I think that my problem is quite obvious but to you it mite 
seem silly but to me it's deadly serious!

So....Romantic !

When you are gone, the sweet smell of your parfume in my clothes reminds me
of you. It reminds me, how special you are to me and how special you make
me feel.I'm so happy beeing a salesman of cheap parfume !!

I'm a junky......

As I walk with you down the street, all the other guys are watching you.
The feeling that you are myn, gives me a kick that can't be beaten by any
drug. I must be the only happy junk on this earth.......
