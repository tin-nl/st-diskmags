AT 386SX FOR M_STE

VORTEX AT-ONCE 386 SX,

Well the MEGA STE isn't really well known even under Atari users.
It's a pitty if you know how fast this machne is on 16 Mhz, but okay
we now discus something else: A special cart made for the MEGA STE 
to run PC software ata tremendous speed. It's the Vortex ATonce-386 SX
a real 386er emulator. This emulator offers the everything you could
expect from a normal 386 SX machine. Even Windows 3.0 (a bit GEM.
enviroment as we know it) run in special made 386 SX mode on the
MEGA STE. The hart of this AT emulator is a 32 bit CMOS 80386SX-16 Mhz
CPU, he uses the full capacity of the cache memory the MEGA STE has 
and thats the reason why it is as fast as it is.

The Norton ( A special speed utility on PC for those who doesn't know)
SI Factor with, 16 Mhz a cache used, 12.3 (MIPS-test 148%).
If you also install on the cart the optional 512 Kb Vortex FAST RAM,
(4 RAMs 514256 70 ns) it will push the speed to a massive Noron SI Factor
of 15,6 (MIPS-test 184%).

If you also install the optional 80387 SX - 16 Mhz Mathematic Co Processor
( INTEL , IIT) in the special already made place, you can see then that
the preformance with calculations will increase once more. This really
looks like an super emulator for your MEGA STE. If you really want to
run PC software on your STE then here is your choice. It's just one small
print you can install ( read very easy ), and there you go. If you
