FOX MULTI COPY BOX

Fox multi copy box, if you are a real copy freak.

In Dusseldorf at the Atari Messe'91 we saw something for the real
copy freaks among use.  It's the Fox MultiCopyBox, a real smart
piece of hardware.  It's a machine that contains 3, 6 or even 9
diskdrives that can write all at the same time. Just read one
soure disk in the computer and you can write it as many times
as you want to 9 drives at the same time. Isn't it great ???

Well yes, there is only one little but to the hole thing...
THE PRICE !!!. The smallest version of the copybox will rip 
1698,- DM out of your hands and then you have only 3 drives.
The 6 drives version (MCB 6) costs 2498,- DM
The 9 drives version (MCB 9) costs 3298,- DM

So you see, its more something for big public domain librarys then
just for fun. If you still have any questions you can write to us
and will can supply you with more information.
