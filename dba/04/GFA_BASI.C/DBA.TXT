STARTING IN GFA


(Written by someone who really started from the bottom but is getting 
 better very fast...)
Hello, 

Bonus asked me to write a text for the DBA Diskmagazine 3. So I wrote 
a bit on programming. Bonus and K.G.E. ( the coders of this magazine) 
are trying to learn me how to program in GFA-Basic. It is not very 
difficult because the instructions are very simple, and GFA-Basic is 
very fast. Not as fast as ASM ofcourse but still for a Basic it is 
very fast. 

If you want to learn how to program you have to observe and remember!
( If you are not so good at remembering you may have to write it 
down! (could come in handy later! ( maybe! ))) As you probably know 
there are some small GFA programs in the DBA Diskmagazines. These are 
great help because they give you a good example of what GFA is capable 
of. And the explanation is very good. 

If you start programming don't start too difficult. You have to start
with a simple concept, and make it more complicated later on. 
For example: 
' 
' Small Gfa example  (I)
'
x%=1                         ! X-coordination.
y%=1                         ! Y-coordination.
dx%=1                        ! counter for x%
dy%=1                        ! counter for y%
'
' Main program
'
REPEAT
 ADD x%,dx%                  ! count x% up with dx%
 ADD y%,dy%                  ! count y% up with dy%
 IF x%<1 OR x%>319 THEN      ! check for not going out of screen.
  dx%=-dx%                   ! if dx%=1 then dx%=-1 and vice versa
 ENDIF
 IF y%<1 OR y%>199 THEN      ! check for not going out of screen.
  dy%=-dy%                   ! same as dx% go and see there.
 ENDIF
 PLOT x%,y%                  ! show coordinations.
UNTIL INKEY$<>""             ! if any key is pressed then
EDIT                         ! go to editor. 

This is a simple example, but you can make it much more difficult, 
you could try to show only ten x-,and y-coordinations.

' Small Gfa Example (II)
'
DIM x%(10),dx%(10),y%(10),dy%(10)      ! create some variables.
FOR i%=1 TO 10
 x%(i%)=i%                             ! give each x% a number.
 y%(i%)=i%                             ! give each y% a number.
 dx%(i%)=1                             ! every x-counter=1
 dy%(i%)=1                             ! every y-counter=1
NEXT i%
REPEAT
 FOR i%=1 TO 10
  ADD x%(i%),dx%(i%)                   ! count up x% with dx%
  ADD y%(i%),dy%(i%)                   ! count up y% with dy%
  IF x%(i%)<1 OR x%(i%)>319 THEN       ! check if not out of screen.
   dx%(i%)=-dx%(i%)                    ! if dx%=1 then dx%=-1 and vice 
  ENDIF                                ! versa.
  IF y%(i%)<1 OR y%(i%)>199 THEN       ! same as above
   dy%(i%)=-dy%(i%)
  ENDIF
  PLOT x%(i%),y%(i%)                   ! show x and y
 NEXT i%
 CLS                                   ! clear screen
UNTIL INKEY$<>""                       ! if any key is pressed then
EDIT                                   ! go to editor

The program is a bit more complicated, but you can make it much more 
difficult just use your imagination. 

If you want to learn how to program then you try to gather (small) 
Gfa-sources, and you try to understand them. You experiment with them, 
and you compare it with other programs. 

As you see you don't have to make it very difficult.
