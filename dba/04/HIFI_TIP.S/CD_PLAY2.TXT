                          CD-PLAYER TEST TIP,

                *************************************

In a lot of Hi-Fi magazine's are CD-Player ( approx. around 500 mark) test's.
The conclusion of all these magazine's are that the Sony CDP 591 is the best 
CD-Player in his class !
I own a CDP 591 myself and i must say it's a excellent player.

The Sony has a lot of options, those options include,

Peaksearch       Music-scan
Remote-control   Line-Out 
Music-calender   Editfunction for cassette's
Fader            Shuffleplay

Functions like: Time ( normal, backwards and total time backwards ), Fast
forward and backwards searching and the rest of the stuff that every player
has, are on this Sony too. 
The Sony has 1-bit( 45 * oversampling ) DA-Convertors that make the CD-player r
sound a lot better than the avarage 16/18 or even some cheap 20 bits players.

The Sony is easy to use, and scores very high on this subject.
It has a music calender with 20 buttons, so you can directly choose between
1 or 20 different tracks.
On the Remote Control are all the functions that are also on the CD-Player.

With the cassette editing system you can select from 6 CD's tracks, that
you would like to copy on your tape.
You can tell the CD-Player the lenght of the tape you will use and it will
put all the songs together that will fit on one side.
With the " link function " the player will select the tracks for the B side
of the tape.
You can use the fader option to fade the music in or out while copying the
music to tape.

The Music-scan function is very handy, if you want to hear all the intro's
of all tracks.
You can listen for 12 seconds to every track and than it will fade away and
goes on to the next one.
If you want to hear the track a little longer then you can press the music-
scan button again while playing, the intro will play 12 seconds longer.

Also very handy on this player is the peak-search function.
If you press this button, the CD-Player will search for the highest peak in
the music and will repeat it till you turn it off.
This allowes you to ajust your input level on your tapedeck.

The sound of the Sony is great.
It sounds better then all the CD-Players from the same price-class.
Sony has given the CDP 591 some extra bass, you can hear it directly when
you replace your old CD-Player for this one !
The CD-Player is very good in the high tones, it's just perfect.
If you have music with a lot of violins in the background it could sound
a bit unclear( but that's really the only remark you can make ).

Conclusion,

A great player for a very cool price.
You get great sound, a lot of functions and a userfriendly machine.
If you need a new player for a view bucks, buy this one !!
