The firm NAD is a very good manufactorer of HI-FI components.
NAD is very famous for their softclipping and Power Envelope system, these
systems are also on the NAD 3226 PE( PE stands for Power Envelope ) !!
The amplifier( and the other components too ) look very cheap, it got
strange knobs and buttons on it.
I don't think that there are much people who buy the NAD stuff only for
their looks !

Okay, lets start with the serious stuff, the amplifier has a Power Envelope
system.
This is a system that gives short burst's of power( watts )when the music
needs it.
Trough this system you don't have to build a heavy transformator in your
amplifier to give the amplifier the power he needs !
So, when the amplifier needs some extra juice to give the music the dynamic's
it needs, the Power Envelope will give some extra watts !

Then there is the soft clipping feature on the amplifier, this system makes
shore that you don't trash your speakers.
When you have a amplifier of 30 watts and your speakers are lets say 60 watts
, then there is a possibility that your amplifier just has not enough power
to play the music like he should( only with very high output !!).
This will create very high peaks, trough these peaks your speakers( esp.
the tweeters) will get very hot and will go bummb....... !
Well, the soft clipping feature will round off these high peaks to a save
peakform !

Okay that's all very nice I hear you say, but how does this amplifier
perform !?
Just great, the NAD 3226 PE has 50 watt of pure and clean power to feast
your ears with !
The sound is clear and with much detail in it, the amplifier can only use
some more low( bass ).
By the way, on the sticker that is put on the amplifier is written that
the amplifier only has 25 watts( at 8 Ohm ) this is not true !!
A power output from more then 50 watts is not an exception.
You can only connect 8 or 4 Ohm speaker on this amplifier !

Specifications on this amplifier are hard to get, coz' there is no list
of specifications with this amplifier !
But i hope you have enough details to decide( after listing ) if the NAD
is your kind of amp. or not !

See ya next time in our third issue.
Remarks and tips are always welcome so drop me a letter will ya' !
