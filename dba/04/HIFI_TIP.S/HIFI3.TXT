This time i've got an loud-speaker review for you.
From my local Hi-Fi shop i could borrow some popular loud-speakers
for me to test.
The intention for me was to buy a couple of new speakers coz' the old
ones showed it's limits and wheren't good enough for me anymore.

So, I tought when i'm going to test these speakers i could also write an
article about it.
I used two different amplifiers to test them with,

My old Kenwood KA-550( soon to be changed for something better )
The Denon 560 ( probably my next buy, but it could be an Cyrus one amp.
too( I must get some money first, coz' that's my big problem )) !

Okay lets start of with the BNS E-14 speakers ( these are my current
speakers, i know it's cheap for an guy who writes this kind of articles. ))

******************************** BNS E-14 **********************************

BNS is one of the biggest and best loudspeaker manufacturers in the 
Netherlands.
They are not well known in other country's but they seem to work on that !
The latest news is that they try to get some feet on the ground in Japan
with some help from Pioneer.
Well, enough of that, lets start the test of the BNS E-14.

The speakers come in a big box with the famous Dutch colours on it( red,
white and blue for those lamers who didn't know that ).
If you open the box and remove all the garbage you see some very nice
looking loud-speakers.
If you look on the backside of the speakers you see the click-sockets.
I call them click-sockets( what else can i call them )coz' you have
to put the cable in holes while pressing a button, when you release the
button the cable is stuck in the hole( brillant ).

These connectors are no good, coz' you can't put thick cable in the tiny
holes( really lame ).
They also make lousy contact between the cable and the socket, the best
connection is the Banana/screw connectors.
You can use thick cable and they make good contact. 

I don't tell you all the specification of the speakers coz' of the simple fact
it has no use at all.
Some figures look very promising but when you test the speakers they turn
out to be shitty.
The only specifications i will give are the Watts and the Ohm's.

****************************************************************************
The speakers will be tested standing on spikes and connected to the 
amplifier using ( OFC ) thick cable of high quality.
They are also standing on stone pilars at ear hight( sitting in my chair ),
both pilars are standing 2 1/2 meters form each-other on one line.
Those pilars are standing 20 cm from the backwall and 50 cm from the side
walls.
****************************************************************************

Okay lets start off...........
The speakers sound very good for only 200 guilders each.
Don't forget to remove the covers while using the speakers it will make
the sound a little clearer.
I started of with some CD's like Pink Floyd and some classical stuff.
On one of the Pink Floyd CD's ( The Final Cut ) is an track called,
One of the Few.
The song starts of with the sound of an clock ticking, but now comes the
fun part, you hear an clock ticking on the left side but do you also hear
the other clock ticking ( other rythem ) on the right side ??
When you own this CD....check it out.
On the BNS you can hear it but very very soft, with an good amplifier and
speakers you must hear it perfectly.

When your Stereo sound is perfect you must hear all the instruments on
the right place's.
The means when the artist is singing in the middle of the band, you must
hear him right in the middle of the speakers.
It also means if the guitar player is standing on the right side( with
your face towards the band ), you must also hear the guitar playing on the
right side if you sit in front of your speakers.
The BNS scores very low on this subject, i find the instruments difficult
to place.

The BNS speakers also lack a lot of mid. ( mid. the area between high and
low ) and are sometimes a bit to high.
This depense also a lot of your amplifier used( the Kenwood KA-550 is not
the most ideal ampf. to use with these BNS speakers )

Final Conclusion: Very good for their money.
                  Could use some more in the mid. and the low area.
                  Stereo is not really stunning( to say the least ).

******************************** Mission 761 ********************************

Sansui Mission is an very famous English compagny that makes audio components 
and stuff like cable's and loudspeaker stands.
Almost every Hi-Fi freak knows the famous loud-speakers serie's 76xx.
The 761 is the second in line of this serie.

Lets play.......... 
This speaker is the follow up of the first Mission 761.
Mission also released an inproved version of the 761 called the 761 i( the
i stand for inproved ).
Almost every loudspeaker of 76xx series had excellent test reports in the
Audio-magazine's( Stereo, Hi-Fi and more.)
You can reconise Mission speakers coz' of the fact that they seem to
stand up side down.
The woofer is placed where normaly the tweeter is installed and the tweeter
sit's on the woofer his place.

Okay you say that's all nice but i wannaknowhowtheyplay.......
Well, bloody great, the speakers have decent cable " sockets " to begin
with( Banana kind of connectors ).

After i hooked up the speakers with my amplifier it became clear to me that
these speakers where of excellent quality.
Where the BNS was weak the Mission was a lot better, the Mission really
sounds a lot better for the 50( each ) guilders you pay more.

The Stereo was good, you could hear the voice coming straight from the
middle of the speakers without any problems.
I tested the stereo with an CD from Van den Berg, coz' in an couple of
songs the drummer banged from the left to the right side.
In the beginning there was an "hole" in the drum part trough the fact
that the speakers where to far a part from each-other.
The problem was solved when i put both speakers just one(!) cm closer
to each-other( 2 cm can change your Stereo ).
Also the Mission failed on the track from Pink Floyd( with the clock
ticking on the left and also on the right ).
So, I hooked them up with the Denon 560 amplifier, but also no inprovement
on the clock part.
It sounded a lot better ofcourse with the Denon 560( optical class A ) 
amplifier but still i couldn't hear the right clock good enough.
The 761 was also better in mid. area and the lower area( very nice to
listen to ).

Final Conclusion: The best speakers in his price class
                  Good Stereo
                  Good high/mid./low

****************************************************************************

With the Mission speakers i also recieved an sort of manual that contained
specification/tips and how to place the speakers in your room.
I saw no manuals/booklet's with the other loudspeakers that are reviewed
in this article.

********************* Studio de Schop Climax *****************************

Another loudspeaker manufacturer from the good old Netherlands.
I cant tell you much about this firm, i simply don't know them so good
coz' they are not so long around.

Altough the speakers are smaller then the BNS and Mission they weigh more.
These speakers got also good cable connexions just like the Missions.

I heard in the shop that these speakers only work good on some amplifiers.
They said that they work perfect with an Cyrus one amplifier.
It's a real pitty that i couldn't get my hands on an Mission one, coz'
they wheren't in stock anymore.
So, the Climax had to do it with my Kenwood amplifier.
The first thing i heard was the heavy bass, these are bass reflex
speakers.
Sometimes there was to much low( for me coz' i live in an flat and the
neighbours get crazy ).

The Stereo " Vision " is very good, it's even better then the Mission.
All instruments are good to place and i clould follow Adrian Van den Berg
while he was playing his guitar.

On the  mid/low part these speakers are just a bit better the Missions.
But the Mission are nicer to listen to, the Studio de Schop's sound a
bit more aggresive.
The voice's sounded sometimes a little unclear( but i think that the
used amplifier isn't good enough ).
If you want to hear them on their limit's then you must connect them
with an Cyrus one or some amplifier that can handle these speakers.
The speakers are just to tough to handle for some amplifiers.

Final Conclusion: Good value for your money  
                  Excellent Stereo.
                  Good in High/Mid./low area
                  Plays even better connected to an better amplifier.

I'm still waiting for the NAD 8225 loudspeakers to test, coz' they seem to
be very good.
So, before i'm gone buy some new speakers, i wanna test them all.

Special thanks go to the Hi-Fi shop for letting me test and play around
with their audio stuff.
If you live in the Netherlands just visit one of their two shops.
