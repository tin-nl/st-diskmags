ABOUT MAGAZINE 4


The story behind D.B.A. magazine 4...

Yooooh here we are again with a new magazine. Well it isn't exact new
it is a compil of older magazines. That's the reason why magazine 5
was out earlier then 4. It's al a bit strange we know but let us
explain why we did it:

1) Not everybody has all the magazines, so we thought it would be good
   to let everybody enjoy the older articles. But most of all the 
   lessons, what good is it if you start with STOS lesson 3 if you didn't
   see 1 and 2. Or we say use the GFA routine from magazine 2 and you 
   don't have it. 

2) The older shell wasn't that nice and didn't work good on every ST/STE
   or TT. This new shell works (sofar we tested it) on ST TOS 1.0, 1.2
   1.4 on STE 1.06, 2.06 on Mega STE 2.06 and TT 3.06. But you must have
   at least 1Mb or else nothing works no matter what TOS version you have.
 
3) It seems that compils are "in" these days and we didn't want to stay
   behind so we made this one. Because, if we didn't probably someone
   else would have don it anyway !!!!!
 
4) We could make it because we pack the files ( at last i hear some people
   say in the distance ) and we wanted to test some things. Test ????
   Yes test, new text scroller, new fonts, new kind of music, Hz fault
   in music is now removed etc...

5) This one is very important: We want to have some vacation too !!!!
   Making a diskmagazine is a hard job, altought many people think it
   is very easy to do. The fast way to fame, well you can forget that !
   And this way we show we aren't dead yet and can make big and very
   good articles for issue 6.
