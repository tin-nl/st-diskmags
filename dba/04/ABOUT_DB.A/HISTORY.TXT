AT THE BEGINNING..

At the beginning there was nothing...

Nothing but darkness and empty bits...

Then a group came and made a diskmagazine.  The group disappeared, the
diskmagazine idea stayed.  Then there was a long time with again nothing
but another group came. They made a new diskmagazine, and another one, and
another one, and here you see already number 4 of that diskmagazine. Well
that isn't true, it is issue 4, but number 5 ?!?!?. A bit hard to under
stand wouldn't you say. If you want to know more about this mix up read
the special article about it named ABOUT MAGAZINE 4.

This is the second generation of diskmagazines made by The Disk Busters
Association. Yes you really can say we are a bit proud to present you this
new look. We worked very hard on it to give you readers a special thing to
wait for i (Bonus) think we did a good job.

Even before issue 3 was released programming for issue 5 had already star-
ted so this new look has cost us about 4 months to make. And too be honest
we are still working on the magazine, cause it always can better.

But we already see that the kind of menu we are using is now used
in lots of other diskmagzines too. I (bonus) hated the silly pull down
menu a long time, so i made a button menu. But now it's quit common so
i think i wasn't the only one.

There are lot's of people still asking us why aren't the text packed the
first issues... 
Simple, there are still lot's of people that have mono monitors and the
diskmagazine program only works in low res. But if they still wanted too
read the text they could just read it on the desktop. 
But there is some good news for those people, there will be a mono 
displayer from issue 6 on so that's why the new issues of the magazine
will have packed text, pictures, music and everything else that is 
"pack-able". So now we can even scram more info on one disk...

But lots of features have been added or improved as there are:

- A new looking main menu in low res
- Better grafix
- Bigger letters to read on the buttons
- Good looking level and note display for the musics
- 50Hz/60Hz music fix
- Smooth scrolling to picture and text submenu's
- New text displayer, split screen
- Much better scrolling
- "Self justifing" auto read mode (" world premiere!!! ")
- Special adjustment for auto read mode
- Better printer options with - Printer Check
                              - Page for page printing option
                              - Complete file printing option
- 4 different NEW fonts
- Over 8 different pictures types possible 
- Small game
- Hidden article(s)

                      and just some more "small" adds... 

So you see lots of options, not all new or record breaking, but enough
to keep you trying things out. We just hope you like this new diskmagazine
design, and show it to us just by sending in some good articles, interviews
pictures, music's or just anything we can use to make it even better.
And if you have a good idea of an option that isn't included yet, then
send it in and we will see if it is possible and usefull to make.
