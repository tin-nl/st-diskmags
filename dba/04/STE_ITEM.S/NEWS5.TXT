                            NEWS about STE
                            --------------

   This time I haven't heard many good rumours, but I'll tell you all I
know.
   Once again I begin from Finland (because I still live here). My own
group (FLASH) is now working on demo called "THE RUNNING MAN". It is not
slide-show, but I can't tell you (not yet) what it is... We'll wait and
we'll see!
   Also CREATOR from CHRONICLE (hi dude!) is working on some kind of STE
productions, but they seem to be quite a big secrets at this moment.
   LIGHT from Germany is still working on their first megademo. They are
also coding a fair demo for CeBit-fair. I hope to see them soon, so I can
review them!
   Games are made for us to play: Wings Of Death 2 has been released. The
game is not so new anymore, but I want to tell you, that there is support
for STE's stereo-sound and blitter-chip. Buy this game, don't copy!

   That was it this time. I Hope I can make this much bigger next time...
Thanx to D.B.A. for being so positive for STE...
