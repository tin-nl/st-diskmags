THE LOST FILES FOR LESSON 3 ???

                    Yo' STOS freaks,

In the folder STOS on disk A are some programmes, in these files are REMS 
explainning  to you what to do with them.

The names of the files are:
                            BLENDPIC.BAS
                            FASTSCRO.BAS
                            FUNYMON1.BAS
                            FUNYMON2.BAS
                            FUNYMON3.BAS
             
These files where included at the very last minute and i looked at them in
a hurry !!
These files must be the lost ones from Magazine 3, but that's for you
to find out( keeps the kids from the street ) !

I've got a million things to do now, coz' some articles are not ready yet
and must be finished as soon as possible.
But first i have to go to work( to my boss ) and tonight i will finish off
the rest of the stuff..........

                 You have fun now, I didn't.........
