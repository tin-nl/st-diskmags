LAMER AID(S) 3
                   SHIT ABOUT LAMERS BY MR.COOL               

This talk about lamers and lamers and lamers is somewhat driving me
mad! What can one do about a problem with this great size. I mean
they are everywhere sometimes you can't even recognise them at first
sight! Hey and that can be a real bummer! For example I was out 
walking on one of these wonderful nights we have here in Sweden "yes
Slimer I now thats advertise for Sweden but what the fuck!!" Well
as I said I was out walking when this normal looking character went
up to me and asked me why I was wearing this Atari jacket with the
sign Atari we are the Champions. So I told him the truth and the
bastard laughed in my face and started screaming that Amiga "sorry 
for the bad language" was the future machine and the Atari was a 
dead machine! So I said to the poor slot hey, have you ever seen 
an Atari in action? No he said but what the point and he laughed
again. So I told him all the good sides of owning an Atari and 
guess what he bought an Atari later on! So that guy went from lamer 
status to a nice guy status and that started to make me think about
what one can do about all this lamer problems in the world! In the
past they have had Cancer AID Farm, AID Africa, Aid AIDS AID and 
God knows what else? What I'm talking about is a worldwide crusade
against those pagan lamers and convert them before they run all 
over us. I haven't really yet got a good plan of how you can do 
this without killing half of the population on earth but I'm open
for any suggestions. Mr Cool is the name so please send in some
of YOUR good ideas how we can make this world an unlamer planet!
