YYEEEAAAAHHH you found it, it's the real hidden screen of this D.B.A.
magazine.
It wasen't really good hidden but if you just don't know that there is
another one then you never find out.
Cool, you probably was foolin' around on the disk when you found this one
or you where just checking all the folders on this disk.

In most of the magazine the hidden screens contain nothing intresting, well
this one is no exception.
But to make it a little bit up to you i gone tell you a little secret !
After this third issue of this great magazine there will be no fourth
issue but we continu with number five !
People who don't know this will be upset and will try to get there hands
on the fourth mag. but there no fourth magazine released by us !
So, you are the lucky one to know this little secret of ours, but don't

Watch out for number five coz' this one will much better then the previous
issue's.
That's it for this time see ya' all later,
