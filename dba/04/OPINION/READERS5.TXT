OPINION - FROM MUG U.K
----------------------

1.  What do you think of this magazine?

On the whole, your magazine is very good.  I only have the one issue so
I do not know how much you have improved since issue 1.  What I see in
issue 3 is very nice.

2.  Which corner(s) are you missing?

I think you should expand your programming, latest demos (even if they are
two weeks old !!) and the latest news sections.

3.  What do you think of the used fonts?

The varied fonts are a nice touch.  Keep them in !!

4.  Which diskmagazines do you also read?

Ledgers, Maggie, HP Source, STEN (in that order or priority !)

5.  Did you find any bugs? If so, which one(s)?

Why does the palette not revert back to the original colours ??  Try this
GFA routine !!

'
' Start of your program
'
INLINE old_palette%
super%=GEMDOS(32,L:0)
BMOVE &Hff8240,old_palette%,32
~GEMDOS(32,L:super%)

'
' Say Goodbye
'
~XBIOS(6,L:old_palette%)
EDIT

6.  Which ST do you own? (520/1040ST/STE/mega...etc.)

I have a 1040STFM (TOS v1.2) with 1 Megabyte of memory

7.  How does this magazine compare with the other ones?

Same answer as for question 1 - I like what I see, so carry on !!

8.  What do you like/dislike in this magazine?

I can't comment as I have only got the one issue.  There is no point in
criticising your English, as I can't speak/write a word of Dutch !!
