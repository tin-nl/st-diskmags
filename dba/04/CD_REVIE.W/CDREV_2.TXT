It's party time.......
I have a lot of new CD reviews for you, so lets start of with the shit.

***************************************************************************

Titel       : Use your Illusion 2
Group/artist: Guns N' Roses

Are you mindfucked yet ??
Finally they released some new stuff, this was about time too.
After the mega seller Appetite for Destruction they only released two CD's
called Lies and a interview CD.
Lies was made to keep the fans happy for a while( wow, a long while ).
But they made up to the fans by releasing two CD's called: Use Your Illusion
part one and two. 
They made two seperate CD's, coz' a dubble CD was too expensive for a lot
of people !
Well, enough of the crap lets go on with the shit on the CD !

I review here the second CD coz' this one is the best of the two and, it
has all the hits on it !!
There is a warning sticker on the CD telling you that some songs include
some nasty language.
Well f..k it, the sound of Guns N' Roses has improved a lot after Appetite
for Destruction.
The group has gone trough some changes, like the old drummer is gone and
replaced by a new one( a very good drummer, do).
They also got an organ/guitar player joining them( I forgot his name ).
I can say that they have changed, but there are some things still the same
like the guitar solo's of Slash( they are just great !!!!!!).
Some hits on the CD are: Knockin' on Heavens Door( Cover ), You Could be
Mine, Don't Cry, Pretty Tied Up( The Perils of N' Rock and Roll Decadence).

My favourite songs are: Get in the Ring, Breakdown( good ), Locomotive and
all the hits !
The songs are very long, most of them last for approx. 7 or 8 min. !
On the CD are 14 songs and they are all of very good quality !

Music Value : 8+                      Recording Quality : 9-

BUT...IT IS WRITTEN IF THE EVIL SPIRIT ARMS THE TIGER WITH CLAWS.
BRAHMAN PROVIDED WINGS FOR THE DOVE, THUS SPAKE THE SUPER GURU.

Title       : Metallica
Group/Artist: Metallica

Yes, Metallica is back and how !!
This Album has reached number one in the U.S.A. and in the Netherlands the
highest position was number four in the charts.
This is not bad for a heavy metal group, on this album is one major hit
called: Enter Sandman.
But on the CD are more cool songs that are just as good.

Most of the heavy metal groups 'sing' about demons, hell, fire, dead and more
of that stuff.
Metallica in the contrary are singing about other subjects.
There are 12 songs on this CD of heavy quality, the songs on this album
are a bit different then we are used to hear from Metallica.
The songs are a bit softer and have a higher " hit " input, to launch this
CD in the charts.

Metal fans, check it out....

Music: 7+                               Recording Quality: 8

Title       : The Concert in the Park
Group/artist: Simon and Garfunkel

In September 1981 there was a big concert in Central Park( New York ).
This Concert is recorded and it was put on a LP. but now they have put
the concert ( finally ) on the CD.
There are two CD's of this concert, one "single" CD and the double CD.
The double CD contains the whole concert and on the " Single " CD are only
the biggest hits.

I have the " single " CD to review here( don't get angry at me now... ).
On the CD are 19 songs from which 18 are written by Paul Simon( a genius ).
The CD contains hits like: Bridge over Troubled Water, The Sounds of Silence
, Still Crazy after all these Years, Late in the Evening, The Boxer and a lot
more.
I think it's a great CD that has to have a place in everybody's collection.


Music: 10                               Recording Quality: 7+

***************************************************************************

Title       : The Razors Edge
Group'artist: AC/DC

This is the latest CD of the band from Australia, AC/DC .
Brian Johnson screams( as always ) his head of and Angus Young play's a
mean guitar.
It's not the AC/DC anymore from the old and better days, but it has to do.
The CD contains the two hits: Thunderstruck and Money Talks.
The rest of the songs are from average quality, it's just rock without
any crap.
On the CD are 12 of those rock songs.

I have a view AC/DC CD's floating around the house, but still i love just
one CD of them the most: Let there be Rock !!
Where have all the good time's gone.......

Music: 7+                               Recording Quality: 8-

***************************************************************************

Title       : 12 Gold Bars Volume 2
Group/artist: Status Quo

It's a golden oldy but who cares ?
On this CD are the biggest hits and the best songs of Status Quo.
I have volume 1 too from Quo and i think that 1 is the best of the two CD's.
Some hits on the CD are: What you're Proposin', Lies, Caroline( Live ), Dear
John, Rock n' Roll and some other newer stuff.

The newer songs don't have the old Quo style anymore and sound like ordinary
pop songs.
In the Netherlands is Status Quo still very popular and there are two places
in our country where the popularity is the highest.
Those two places are Drachten( where i life ) and a place called Nijmegen.
I tought it's maybe nice to know for the English fans of Quo.
All in all a nice CD with some old and new songs of the group.

Music: 8                                Recording Quality: 8
