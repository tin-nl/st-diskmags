Yes, people a new magazine and another CD-review corner.
This time we got Pop Classic's, Pearl Jam, The Kinks and more....
Some of the CD's are loaned from some good friends( thanks ) and some
others i bought a time ago.
Well lets cut the bull and make a start with the actual reviewing and
remember my opinion is only my own........

***************************************************************************

Titel       : Pop Classics 2 the long versions ( double CD )
Group/artist: Various
Playing Time: more the 2 hours ( 23 tracks )

There are at the moment 3 different double CD's with Pop Classics the
long versions released.
I've got number one on tape, so i can not give al the details about this
one, but i've got number two and three for my review.

Most people know the radio versions of the songs on these CD's but they
never heard the whole song before........
The first CD was a big succes and a second one was to be expected, altough
i found the second one a bit boring.
But then a third one appeared and i think this one is the worst of them all,
coz' i've got a feeling that they had trouble filling the third CD.
There are so many good songs in this world but why must they always pick
the shitty one's( but that's my opinion ofcourse ) ?

Right lets go down to Bussines,

This CD contains a lot of different songs from various artists.
There is Phil Collins, Prince( twice ( why twice ??), John Miles( jeesus
i've got this dude on 4 different CD and tapes ), Ram Jam ( you can find
them on the rock ballads CD's( complete ) and many more.
There is also a song from the CD; War of the Worlds of Jeff Wayne on this
CD and that sort of things gives me the feeling that they used all the
good songs on the first CD.
Fine, The overall quality is very good, but before you buy the second and
third CD watch very closly if they are really worth buying it !
 

Music Value : 7+                      Recording Quality : 8+ ( A?D )

Titel       : Pop Classics 3 the long versions
Group/artist: Various
Playing Time: Almost 2 hours

The third CD of the Pop Classic serie with some new stuff.
I find on this CD; another Prince this time with the Revolution, are there
not two tracks on the second CD of him ??
Phil Collins is also on this one just like on the the second CD, this
proves my point that they couldn't find other stuff to put on these CD's.
If i want to hear Prince everytime, i would have bought his albums to
listen too.
Europe is also present with the Final Countdown, this song was heard so
much that it makes me puke !

There are only 4 songs that i really like on this CD and the rest i found
absolutly crap( is captain Sensible with the song WOT a classic song ??).
Overall quality is fine and so is the recording quality, the same comment
as with CD two : Watch before you Buy !

Music Value: 7+                          Recording Quality: 8+ ( A?D )

Titel       : Pearl Jam
Group/artist: Pearl Jam
Playing Time: 53:26 ( 11 tracks )

Here is something new on the hard-rock front( for me ) called; Pearl Jam.
Although i listend a view times to this CD, i never was really impressed
by their songs.
I don't see this CD as a new discovery like the Nirvana one, but i think
that it is up to you to dicide if you like them or not.

The CD contains some song like Once, Even Flow, Deep and some more tracks.
They use short titles and find that very handy when i want to write the
titles of the songs on the tape-index paper.
In the CD-Box is also a small poster with the members of Pearl Jam on it.
So, i'm not that negative about this CD as you might think..........

Music Value: 7+                         Recording Quality: 8+ ( AAD )

Titel       : Greatest Hits ( double CD )
Group/artist: The Kinks
Playing Time: 97:54 ( 33 tracks )

Some time ago i bought myself a double CD from the Kinks.
The songs are completly digitally remastered, including the vocals and
the songs are sounding quite fresh again.

The Kinks is group that formed in 1964 and are still together at this
moment( the songs on this CD are from the years 1964 till 1970 ).
The strong man in the band is Ray Davies who wrote almost every song on
the 33 track CD and there are also 1 or 2 song performed by him without
the the rest of the band.
Most of the younger generation of readers will only know the hit, Lola
and You Really Got Me( only then covered by Van Halen ).
There are more songs that are covered by other people, but people always
seem to forget( or just don't know ) where they come from.

I like this CD very much, it contains rock-songs and other kinds of music.
Some titles are: Mr. Pleasant, Lola, Set me Free, Dedicated follower of
Fashion, Death of a Clown, Waterloo Sunset and many many more.
The CD box contains also a booklet with songtext's and a bit of history
about the group.
Well worth checking out............

Music Value: 9-                         Recording Quality: 7+ ( ADD )

Titel       : No More Tears ( Maxi CD Single )
Group/artist: Ozzy Osbourne
Playing Time: 15:07 ( 3 tracks )

I never reviewed a Maxi CD before, but what the heck.
The main song on this CD is; No More Tears which was a little hit.
There are two other songs also present on this disc called; S.I.N. and
Party With The Animals.
These two songs are very nice too, altough the main song is my favourit.

Well, if you see this one floating around the music-store and you don't
know Osbourne it's worth checking out.
For the Osbourne fans buy the CD, you get more songs for your money.

Music Value: 7                         Recording Quality: 8
