who like that so much, and for this time i will have a talk with Slimer!
Yeh, now some words about Mister Slimer. The moment he got the questions for
his talk with me he was very afraid! Yeh, he was very nerveous. So the first
thought of him was:revenge! It's very bad of him ofcourse but so next
time you will read a talk with me. You guys are very inquisitive to me i
think. So let's go on and read! Special greetings for Larsie of Sweden of

NEWSPAPER
=========


Man and woman with both a job is growing in Holland
___________________________________________________


In more than 50% in Dutch families there's a second income. People who are
married of people who lives together beneath 65 years comes nowadays even
in two of three times a second income inside. A man or woman who makes
money alone or his family are returning. The tradiotional family with man
is working and woman is housewife is dying. Majority of the Dutch population
consist of people alone who care for them selve and possible children and
people with both a job in one family.

-1/3 of working people in Holland earn each month 4.000 guilders or more
-27% becomes each month between 3.000 and 4.000 guilders
-27% becomes each month bteween 2.000 and 3.000 guilders

Merely one of the ten working people becomes below 2.000 per month.(This
notes are total income and not individual income).

The most low income in Holland are in non-profit sector(healthcare, welfare
work and similar). Almost one of five people who works in this sector
haven't more than 2.000 guilders per month. Land and horticultures and
self- emplyed people don't make a lot money. 1/3 of agrarian have an income
below 2.000 guilders.1/4 of self- employed haven't more than 2.000 guilers.
Best pay job are directors of companies. One of three get more than 6.000
guilders per month. One third yet get between 4.000 and 6.000 guilders.

The idea of high education isn't per defenition a high income. People with
secondary school/or secondary profession school have mostly almost a high
income then people with high education. People of the last group haven't
more than 2.000 per month net. People with university and high profession
school makes a lot of more money. More than 42% of this people have 4.000
guilders per month of more.


CONCLUSION
++++++++++

Welfare connected not only with work but with familysituation too. Almost
two on three people alone have an income of 3.000 or less, in spite of the
question if he or she works or get an inemployment benefit. People who
are divorced or widow/widower are much more poor than married people or
people who lives together. One parent families with only a mother becomes
in 60% below then 2.000 guilders per month (mostly social security). Most
fathers have a job. So when they are one parent family they have a lot more
money. Half of them get between 2.000 and 4.000 per month.




LOOK INTO THE MIRROR OF YOUR HAIRDRESSER MORE OFTEN..
=====================================================


A girl of 20 years old in Holland wanted to have a coupe soleil. Her hair-
cap was broken and the backside of her head is burned now (3th greeds).
Doctors of Martini Hospital in Groningen have cut a piece skin of her left
buttock. They have put on that piece of buttock at her head. The section
of the piece was seven centimeter and the girl said: Yes, sit down is
very painly for me this moment..



MAGNETRONS WARM UP FOOD VERY BAD
================================



Because magnetrons warm up food very bad, people can get very easy a food
poisoning. For killing bacteria must the meal warm up 70%C of more.
Research have showed: even one of sixteen tested magnetrons warmed up
the meal on some places till 95 greeds and on other places till even 
30 greeds! 



THERE WASN'T NICE THINGS ON TELEVISION..
========================================



People who lives in east of Holland have the name of very sober nation. Very
lonely, not meddlesome and don't like sensation. Sunday evening ten o'clock
the policeradio said there was an UFO landed on industryside in Hardenberg.
Many people went outside for seeiing there the UFO. Later policeman said it
was a test. They wanted to know how many persons eavesdrop the policeradio.
A breakdown lorry was hired for making a show for look like an UFO with 
many lights and so on. 
The reason of this test were a chimneyfire earlier in evening. The firemen
had many problems with curious people. They had eavesdrop the policeradio
for sensation. So on this cold evening in november  with his UFO was a great
succes. The lady in mentionroom said to all scannerlisteners: thank for
the breakdown lorry company and all moonmen!! One of the eavesdroplisteners
got suspicion when policeradio said: there's an UFO landed on industryside.
After some time he heard: people of aviation have seen many things. His
neighbour went for seeiing the UFO yet. His last words: Ach,there wasn't
nice things on TV...

       must do very best because otherside looks my mother in law.
       Colleague: Do you realy think you can hit her?


       Man to the woman: "You wash, you ironed, you cleaned, you dusted,
       you cooked, so how can you bore now !!?!



NICE TO KNOW!

*     One of six children are allergic to housemite.
      Maybe you don't think so but the sweet teddybear
      is a big bring about of the allergic reactions,
      because it's full of housemite!
      So put the teddybear each three weeks one day in 
      deepfreezer for killing housemite.


*     When you have the hiccup you must put your fingers
      in each ear for twenty seconds. That works much better
      then a glass of water of hold your breath in. So your 
      ears are closed, the hiccup will end soon.


*    Smoking is very bad for your face.
     When you smoke many years your face is
     a lot more damaged than 50.000 hours sun!


*   In the early morning you must sing high notes
    so you are protect for stress the whole day.
    In bathroom you can relax most.

POEM
====



           Happiness,


           happiness is like a sunbeam
           the smile of life
           It talks a marvellous language
           Maybe it takes a little time
           Just when the light is gone
           and rise in darkness
           realised the human after long time
           How wishless happy he was.........
