   -     Don't sport with somebody's who's stronger than you, because
         a person that is stronger can demotivate you. Your self-
         confidense can get a dent. After that you feel a lot worse than
         better.

   -     In 1985: 1 of the 85 birth's got more then 1 baby. At this moment
         the figure has increased 1 of the 50. This is due to the fact
         that mothers older than 35 years use sometimes hormon-treatments.

   -     1 of the 8 women have the courage to ask a nice man for his phone-
         number. Because some man have no courage to call them if they own
         their phonenumber.

   -     English sexuoloog Maurice Katz: people from the city's don't make
         love very often. City-live and Carbonic-oxide make city-people more
         tired then other people to make love. They only make love with their
         partner once a week.

          H  E  S  S  E  L   AND  MS.  A  N  G  E  L   IN CONCERT !!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Is Ms. Angel going to be famous or what ??
Read it in the following ( true ) story,

Hessel is a very favourite singer from Terschelling one of the Frisian
islands of the Netherlands. He own's his own pub, the man is a singing
bartender. He began singing in his pub to the customers and they all liked
it so much that he became a favourit singer very fast. Now he is so popular
that he fills the Ahoy halls with thousands of fans. The complete Ahoy was
completly sold out, someting that only happens when big popstars perform
there. So, now you know some history before we begin with the actual story.

                     T  H  E    C  O  N  C  E  R  T

Miss Angel can sing very well. So, there was the moment on 27 and 28 March
1992. The great Youth Choir of " Nan van Groeningen "got the change to sing
in Thialf ( Ice-skating ) Heerenveen with the popular singer " Hessel van
der Kooij ". Last year he had concerts in the Ahoy in Rotterdam. Hessel has
practiced some songs with the choir and Hessel and choir are big friends now.

Friday evening 27 March it was the first evening with Hessel in concert and
it was really great. Hessel landed with a helicopter on the platform. The
decor-builders had build a parts of Terschelling on this platform. That was
really fantastic. People who have visited the concert where very enthusiastic
about the concert in Thialf.

Miss Angel and her friends stood in the hall to listen and watch the concert.
A copy of his own pub was build on the platform. Later the show was for the
Youth choir of Drachten. They climbed at the platform two on two and they
waited for the opening of the pub on the platform. When it was open the choir
played the public in his pub and Hessel was singing to them. The choir was
very enthusiastic about this opening.

After that Hessel walked away and went beneath this high platform. So the
choir was left alone in the pub on the high platform. Now we were singing
with Hessel the songs: Border Song and the Final Scene. Saterday evening the
T.V. was there too, so that was really great. The concert was life broadcasted
on the radio. After the two songs the choir went away of the pub and they
were walking behind the side-scene. After about then minutes the Youth
choir came at the platform, a copy of the beach of Terschelling and were
dancing and singing with Hessel again for example: Back to Terschelling.

Both evenings were really fanastic. After the second evening the choir got
a lot of autograph's of Hessel. Many people of the choir had bought caps
or T-Shirts of Hessel. Ms. Angel too. Miss Angel and her friend and other
people of the " famous " Youth choir of Drachten heard that the choir went
on a picture with Hessel. So Miss Angel wanted to find Hessel between all
the  young singers to get a real good photo with him. The compagny where
Ms. Angel " works " heard that she would probably appear on T.V. ! So they
asked her to do some advertising for them. Yes they where very clever. The
compagny made a T-Shirt with their logo on it for Ms. Angel, so that she
could wear it on the concert. That was one of the reasons for her to search
for publicity. Camera's and picture's and so on. It was very difficult 
sometimes but I think it succeeded, I stood for the platform so the camera's
must see me ofcourse ! Hessel promised the choir that he would hang a photo
of us in his pub. Which is great ofcourse.

The second evening, Ms. Angel had a big laugh because she and her friends
wheren't looking at the platform like the public. No they where looking
and shouting in an other direction. The public thought that we were al
crazy. But we knew that Hessel came in a helicopter and the public didn't
knew that. So they all tought that we were crazy. It was a big suprise for
the fans when he arrived in a helicopter. The choir had practiced with 
Hessel so we knew that he would arrive with a helicopter.

We were treated very good and everyone of the choir got four consumption
tickets for free. After the last evening Hessel said that he was very pleased
with the Youth choir of Drachten. So, Ms. Angel and her choir were very
satisfied too ofcourse. They have had many attention of the T.V. and the
newspapers. When the concerts were over the choir went back to Drachten.
The city of many famous people.
