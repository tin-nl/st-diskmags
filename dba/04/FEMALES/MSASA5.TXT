STORY. 5

Another story of Miss A.S.:

A couple of weeks ago, I was sleeping at a rich uncle and 
aunt. They all ready went to sleep, and I was watching a movie, 
when the phone rang. 

At first I wanted to let it ring,but the phone kept ringing.

Because I did'nt want to wake my uncle and aunt I answered the
phone.

A deep voice said to me: " Is this the house of Mister and 
Misses Johnson?" 
As this was a fact I said: " Yes it is."
I was ordered to take a big knife out of the kitchen.

When I got back the voice told me to kill my uncle and aunt.
I never liked them so I went to the bedroom, killed them, and
went back to the phone again, and asked what to do with the 
corpses. 

"If you are sure that they are dead, you can throw them in the 
swimming-pool." it told me. I told him that they didn't own a
swimming-pool, and that there wasn't any in a range of
a 1000 metres. "Oh? allright then throw them in the river behind
the bungalow." A bit wurried I told him there wasn't a 
river behind the house, and that this house wasn't a bungalow.

"Huh?! Sorry wrong number!!!"
