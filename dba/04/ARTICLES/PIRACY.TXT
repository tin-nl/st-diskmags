PIRACY ON THE ST
                      STOP CRACKING - START FUCKING
                      -----------------------------

   This story is about piracy on Atari ST/E. First of all I want to warn
you: If you are an pirate, don't take this personally!!!
   The piracy on ST/E-scene has grown too fast. Swappers, crackers and
packers are just too fast these days. And of course there are those many
pirate-bbs.
   The idea of crackers is usually quite good: more software for people!
But there are too few buyers for the games. So soon there won't be games
at all! I think it is lamer's job to crack the game and spread it all 
over the world. That doesn't mean that all the crackers are lamers. In 
fact, most of them are very cool guys. But their job is silently killing
ST.
   My point is that we all ST-owners should buy some games in future. So
the software-houses would start their full ST/E support again. It is not
too late yet, but if we keep copying cracked games, the future will be
very dark...
   Another thing, that I want to say is that why don't those clever(?)
software publishers give their support for STE. There are so many STEs
around, that it certainly would be good for them. I could buy much more
games, if I could be sure that they support STE's improvements.
   My last thing in this story is this: Keep your heads up! The ST is not
going to die. But we must help it a little for a new rise! Just remember
this: BUY good software, ignore cracked shit!
