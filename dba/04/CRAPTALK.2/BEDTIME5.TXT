Once upon a time there was a very friendly old guy called Freddy.
Freddy was always very helpfull and friendly for childeren and old farts.
There was only one problem with Freddy, he had these black-outs when he
was outside but he could never remember what happend afterwards ( thats
why they call them black-outs ).

It was a sunny day and the rain poured down from the sky.
While the thunder was shakin' the house, Freddy was in a deep sleep.
Snnnoooor zzzzzzz BOOOMMMM !!!( BOOOMMM meens the thunder ), what the
f**k was that and Freddy turns on the lighswitch( ever seen a lightswitch
that was turned on ??).
After he blowes out the match, he lights the candle with his flashlight.
I hope that the thunder didn't hit my house, coz' i never heard such a
big bang before in my life.
So, Freddy walks down the stairs and examens the whole house, but he
can't find anything special.

Well, lucky for me everything is cool, so lets make breakfast.
BOOOMMM !!!! It sounded if it was coming from the garden, Freddy
rushes outside and there he see's little Arnie( the kid from the
neighbours ) playing aound with his G.I. Joe rocketlauncher.
The whole garden looks like a battlefield with big holes in it.

You little rat, out of my garden !!....screams Freddie with a big smile.
But instead of leavin' the garden the little kid points his G.I. Joe
rocketlauncher at Freddie.
But Freddie( an ex-commando ) throws in a reflex a handgranate to the boy,
this was the greatest suprise that Arnie ever got.
Little Arnie was so happy that he blowed up the house instead of Freddie.

There was Freddie all alone with no house, but there was one positive thing
that day, and that was the fact that the sun was shining.
But then suddely..........................................................
..........................................................................
..........................................................................
.............OOOhhhh my head, i must have had one of my black-outs, Freddy
looks around and he noticed that he was no longer in the garden.

It's very warm on deck of the big cruis-ship and tiny ice-moutains are
floating by in the deep blue sea.
Well, i dunno how i came on this boat, but i can better make myself a 
little comfortable says F. to his self.
But before he gets the change to stand up, this guy comes towards him and
introduces his self as Peter.
This guy Peter has blond hair( standing very wild on his chest )and looks
like a caracter from some Dutch soap-serie.

Do you have seen Bopje my little doggy ???
No says F. and really don't care so bug off( a strange story sofar, don't
you think, but don't worry it won't get stranger than this.......).
Ohhh there he is.......screams Peter and he takes his cat in his arms and
takes of in his Superman suit.
Freddie is standing with his moult open and in his eyes you can read:
suprise !!
This boat is like a floating loonie-farm, i gotta get outta here fast,
F. say's to hisself.
But suddenly a big orcestra begins to play, followed by a big cracking
sound the boat has hit a ice-moutain.

There are people walkin' quitly on the deck, but Freddy is in big panic.
Relax say's somebody to Freddy......this boat can't sink.
The orcestra begins to play harder and harder and the boat begins to
do things that only a Submarine can do......
And then..................................................................
..........................................................................
Guess what, yeaah he gets one of his black-outs, oooh my head !!

Where am i, and thats a very good question coz' i ( Slimer ) don't know
either( this wasn't in the script ).
Well, let me think something up then................
Yeaah, Freddie is now in a airplane, flying high above the clouds.
Yooh this is fun....bbbrrrrbrrrrrrbbbrbrrbrbrrrrbbbrrrr br.. brrr....bbbb
....brrr....bbrroooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA.
Is this the earth that is coming toward us or.......
Then the door to the cockpit opens and the pilot runs towards the exit-
door of the plane and jumps out.
While he is falling, Freddie hears him say: Shit, i forgot something......

Cool, then the co-pilot comes running to the door, but F. stops him.
Don't let me behind in this crashing plane, he begs the pilot, give me
a parachute.
Okay, the co-pilot screams, but do you know how this thing works ??
Noo, Freddie wispers coz' the plane is making a awful screaming sound.
Well, if you pull the right cord, the parachute will open.
But if this doesn't work?? ask's Freddy.
Then pull the left cord and the spare parachute will open yells the pilot.
But if that doesn't work, ask's Fred.
Then you come back to get a new one, the co-pilot say's and jump out of the
airplane, followed by Freddy.
Damn, here goooooooeeeeeessssssssssss......................

Lets pull the right cord.... oh oh nothing happens.
No panic, lets pull the left one......hhhmmm still nothing.
I'm dead, Freddy thinks and begins to scream for his mommy !
Suddenly this guy in a superman suit appears on the scene, a phone
is hangin' around his neck( he was in a hurry ).
I will catch you he says to Freddy, but suddenly Peter( the guy in the
suit ) gets a black-out and falls towards the clouds.
The earth is closing in very fast now and F. can see a church tower getting
bigger and bigger.
Oooh my head................................................................
............................................................................
My bleedin' head, where the f**k am i this time ??
Ooh i'm in a candy-store, what can possibly go wrong in a candy-shop !?

A strange looking guy is standing gehind the counter, he looks like a 
caracter from a Dutch soap serie.
Ding dong, a other guy comes in the store and goes to the counter.
He ask's: can i have one shovel ??
The man behind the counter answers: this is a candy-store and no hard-ware
store, dude !
Sorry, the man replais: I tought that i entered the shoe-store !

Strange stuff, Fred thinks and he runs for the door, but the way is
blocked by somekind of woman( looks like a woman from a Dutch soap serie ).
The woman begins to kiss Freddie very wildly and F. is hoping for another
black-out( but ya' never get one if you really need it ).
Then he F. gives this woman a knee in her vital part, and the voice from
the woman changes to a man's voice.
Rhhaaaaa yells the man in the pink flower dress; my f**kin' balls !!

I'm sorry Freddy says to Lola( that's the guy his pseudo name ).
Well i'm not the worlds most passionate guy, but when i looked in her eyes
i could almost fall for my Lola, LLLL Lola !!
Somekind of bands is playing on the radio by the name of the Kinks.
Everytime they start to play that song i get this feeling to dress up
like a woman the man say's.
Here you have a Cola say's the man behind the counter and throws a can
to the man in the pink trousers.

OOOhhh  my head............................................................
...........................................................................




Yeeaaah this is the end of this bedtime story, i've run completly out of
inspiration( to tell you the truth i never had any while writing this
piece of heavy crappy text ).

                         Smell ya' later, Slimer
