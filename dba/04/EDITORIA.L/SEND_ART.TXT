                      Welcome to the editorial part
===========================================================================

We hope you like the new look of this magazine. We made in low res this
time so we could use more colors to make things look a bit better. The
basic idea and structure is still the same, so the usage of this magazine
shouldn't get you into any trouble. But oke enough bull, let's get a bit
serious.

So if you are reading this you probably want to send us something like
pictures or text. Well okay we love it, great idea it will only help to make
this magazine bigger and better. But before you make a wild start on making  
something here are some things you have to know:


- If you want to write an text or doc to us write it in Tempus or in just an
  ED.TTP.
  if you want to use 1 Word + then please switch WP MODE off before you save
  the file, this way it will be a clean ASCII file.
- Don't make the text longer than 400 lines. If your article is longer then
  please make two files of it.
- Use only 78 characters on one line, cause that is the maximum.
- Don't use funny markes as TAB or special codes.
- Put them on disk, not on paper or else we have to type it all in.
- Please not the followings parameters

On the first line you must write the name of the file, max. 18 characters
long and all in upper case letters like HELLO or EDITORIAL.
Them leave one line open (just press RETURN once).
Type the name of the file again, in upper of lower case, doesn't matter
anymore now.
One line open again, an them start writing.
 
Hope you got that....


- For the pictures: see SENDING PICTURES article.

But if you want to send something else like a good piece of music, an home ma
de utility or game or just anything that you programmed and think it's worth
publishing then send it in. But always remember, DON'T SEND PIRATED SOFTWARE
cause we can't use it in the D.B.A.magazine. Everything you made yourself is
okay or if it is really P.D.

If you want you can send more then 1 text or 1 picture, if there is room or 
if they are that good we will place them all. You can send it to the D.B.A.
Headquarters or to Bonus Software it's all the same. If you send a disk make
sure there is enough postage with it to send it back. We will try to copy
the newest D.B.A.magazine on it, so you don't have anything to loose here i
would say. Please write on the disk what the last magazine is you have.

Well what more can i say, get writing or drawing, and remember it don't
have to be about computers or something like that. A good film review or a
special comic book, a new hit or album from your favourite group, the best 
car in the world or what ever. If it's good then it gets its place in
the magazine.
