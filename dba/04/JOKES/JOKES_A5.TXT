"Zsa Zsa wanted an appology from Beverly Hills for putting her on trial".
"Isn't that a lot like Exxon wanting an apology from Alaska for getting
duck feathers in their oil?"

 Carson said of the same issue - "ZsaZsa now says that she's worried
 about lesbians in prison.  With her acting career, she should worry
 more about meeting thespians in prison."

Quoted from Sacramento Bee:

Yakov Smirnoff on his communication with friends who came to America before him:

  "Before they left, we worked out a code that they would say the opposite of
what they meant in their letters," Smirnoff recalled.  "When they wrote that
   'the streets are filthy and the people are rude' we thought that they meant
   the people were friendly and the streets were clean.  Since they live in
   Cleveland, we later learned they had forgotten the code."

A young member of the German communist party went to his senior comrade
  with a strange request: he wanted permission from the Party to emigrate
  to West Germany. (It is only with the permission of the Party that
  people are allowed to leave East Germany. Often it is ``granted'' as
  a method of eliminating people with inappropriate attitudes.)
  ``For what reasons could you possibly want to leave the Socialist
  paradise, young comrade?'' ``Well, sir, I have a main reason, and
  a kind of side reason. The side reason is this: I know our Party
  has established a paradise here in the Democratic Republic, but the
  reason I want to leave is that I am very afraid that is will not last.''
  ``Don't worry, son! It will last for ever.'' ``Well, good, sir: but
  that brings me to my main reason....''

On yesterday's evening news, Grenady Gerasimov (sp?)  the Soviet
Union official spokesman said that the USSR has a new foreign
policy.  After the Brezhnev Doctrine, they were calling this one
the "Frank Sinatra Doctrine."  According to Gerasimov, Sinatra
has a song "I'll Do It My Way" and that is what the Kremlin wants
its satillites to do.  They can run their countries their own way.

reads --- "The General Secretary with the pigs; fifth from the left"!

Deng Xiaoping tells Gorbachev that three demands must be met before
relations can improve.  First, China wants 100 million tons of coal.
"Agreed," says Gorbachev.  And 20 new ships.  "Done," says Gorbachev.
And a million bicycles.  "Impossible," says Gorbachev.  "But why?"
asks Deng.  "Because," says Gorbachev, "the Poles don't make bicycles."

"True.  But there is this similarity.  Each of us is a traitor to his
class."

MBA = Morals Be Absent?

From Molly Ivins' column in the December issue of /The Progressive/.

"As part of [Harvard Business School dean John] McArthur's effort to weed
out people interested only in lucre, the admissions process now includes
thirteen questions and nine essays, rather than a standardized test, and
takes hours to complete.  To make the cut, students must answer a few
questions about ethics.

"For example, they are asked to explain, in the application, how they
managed an ethical dilemma they have experienced.  But according to Laura
Gordon Fisher, the school's admissions director, many students say they
have never encountered an ethical dilemma.

"'It's amazing how many people admit they've never experienced a moral
dilemma,' said Fisher.  'Some applicants want to know if they should
fabricate one.'"
