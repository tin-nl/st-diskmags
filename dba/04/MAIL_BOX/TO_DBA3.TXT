TO D.B.A. 3

Hello DBA-Magazine-Team !

First, i must say, your Magazine is absolutely the BEST of them
all . The only Mag that could make competition on you is the 
Maggie from SammyJoe/DF because of it's good Scene-infos support,
but i think, if the DBA-magazine will become famous, that will 
change (Stabloid doesn't count, cause i haven't get it now ...)
I'm ROADWARRIOR, with MMU the founder of a new and very great
Demo-crew . At the moment we have 2 Coders, 3 Swapper,
1 real cool graphist (ME), 1 Professional Soft-Expert and more .
Maybe a very good coder of a famous group will also join .
But i don't think, that you want to hear this crap ... or do you ?
So, on this disc are some articles for your magazine, i hope they
are good enough for your discmag and wait for you to send me the
next issue ...
I would be glad to make more articles for you, because i have had
very much fun with your mag, more than with any other mag ...
So, send me the next mag and a letter for me as soon as possible ...
i think, this is all for now, hope to hear from you cool guys !

BYE, ROADWARRIOR

(MY ADRESS IS IN THE ARTICLES ...)
