Falcon Update Digital Issue 6
=============================

This is a plee for help, it really is.  While I am rather happy with
the way the magazine has turned out I was really upset that I could
not use the brilliant MasterBrowse to display the text files. 
Instead you have that crappy rush-job you see before your eyes.

What I need is a text displayer that will work under NVDI, in 16
colours, 80 columns, double line off and be able to run as a TTP (TOS
TAKES PARAMETERS) so I can pass it the name of the file to display.

Now there may already be a public domain or shareware one out there
but I don't have it.  If you are willing to write one, or indeed
already have one you use regularly then can I please urge you to get
in touch with me so I can replace this nasty thing you see now.

There are a few other things I need, and again is anyone can help
then please get in touch :-

1. A way to turn the key clicks off from within HiSoft Basic, or a
little program that turns them off I can run from within the FOG
Shell.

2. A program that can detect if the speaker is on or off and ask the
user if they would like to enable or disable it accordingly.  Again a
HiSoft basic routine would be great but a small executable will
suffice.

3.  A TTP JPEG displayer (if there is such a thing) because although
GIF pictures are nice and colourful, they don't half take up a lot of
room!

4. A FOG FLI animation, a nice raytraced FOG logo, a custom drawn FOG
picture - hell anything really!!!

I know that someone somewhere can help me out here so please do take
the time to get in touch.  I promise you'll feel better because of
it!  Well I will give you some free PD at least.

The address is as usual.
