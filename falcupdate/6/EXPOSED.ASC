
         EXPOSE - True Colour - Real Time - Video Digitiser
                        from Titan Design Ltd


WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

REAL TIME?
Cheaper alternatives do NOT offer Real Time image capture, meaning
that unless the image is stable the end result will be blurred - only
Expose can digitise motion pictures.

TRUE COLOUR?
Cheaper alternatives only allow for image capture in monochrome. 
Even if RGB filters or splitters are used, this increases the cost
and complexity of operation - Only Expose captures True Colour images
on the fly.

THE TRUTH!
Expose captures frames from the video source (VCR, camcorder, etc.)
up to 25 frames per second in True Colour!  Resolutions can be
configured up to the maximum 512x512.

Using special software techniques, Expose can capture superb 24-bit
True Colour images at the full 512x512 resolution capability.

IMPORT
Expose allows imported video images from RGB broadcast VCRs or Video
cameras and, when using the Frex Link, is fully compatible with
equipment having Composite output.
