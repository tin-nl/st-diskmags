Snail Mail       : 10 Oak Drive,
                   Portishead,
                   Bristol,
                   BS20 8QS

or               : PO BOX 353,

The Bristol address is 100% safe but the PO BOX is the fastest.  When I 
am at University (Stafford) ie term time, use the po box, otherwise 
send the mail to the Bristol address.

You can phone me (Richard) on : +44 0275 843241
but only during University holiday times (ie Christmas, Easter and
from mid June to mid September).

Submissions welcome, please send them on disk and don't forget to 
include a stamp if you'd like your disk back (with the best new PD I 
can find included on it).

Disk Swappers are most welcome, the complete list of PD and Shareware 
we have will be printed in the next issue.

FALCON UPDATE DIGITAL is released on the last day of each month, issue 
five is due out on the 31st July.  If you would like to do a picture
