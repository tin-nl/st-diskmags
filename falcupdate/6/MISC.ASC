          Where the programs really didn't fit anywhere else!

BIGSCREEN shows you an amazing resolution on your RGB monitor!  BOUND
bounces this ball around the screen by CRAC.  COOLSONG is a groovin'
module tune.  DRAGON is a little Falcon demo.  ETERNITY is a little
Falcon demo to welcome new group to the scene.  FLIGHT is a trip into
a fractal, well its three trips actually.  FRACTALE is a program to
make your own fractals with the DSP if wanted.  GOURAUD is a little
vector demo to show off gouraud shading in real-time.  MAD is exactly
that!  MOUNTAIN will make fractal mountains and fly through them
albeit a little slowley even on 030!  MUDU is a module player that
runs in the background.  SWABS is a screen expander for RGB only. 
UTOPOS is an STE thrust style game that almost works on the Falcon.

A real mixed bag here.  STELLO a good Othello game but too hard. 
JPEG4A convert from JPEG to GIF and vica versa.  ANCIENT ART OF ASCII
convert a PI3 into an ascii text file.  SNAPSHOT runs in any mode
saves screen as BTL file (display source included).  TEXT 2 PRG turns
a text file into a .PRG file with fast scrolling displayer built into
it.  TRIYAHOO is a wild Yahtzee game with manic samples and very
addictive if you like puzzle games.  BACKWARD 2.42 is new backward
version, why on this disk I don't know!

The classic ST disk magazine - MAGGIE - was taken over by Chris Holland (a
FOG member!) and his gang of keen Atarians who push out new issues of this
classy disk mag whenever they feel like it.  The shell is easy to use and
nicely presented, often with a topical picture behind it slagging various
other companies like Sega and Commodore!  The artiles are well written and
what's more they are very well laid out too.  There is an every increasing
coverage of the Falcon and I feel you will enjoy these magazines a lot.
I have put two issues on this disk - Issues 12 and 13 - they are MSA (Magic
Shadow Archives) and will need to be de-packed to disk (the MSA program is
included).  Invaluable reading.

DBA DISK MAGAZINE Issue 10.  This is the new Falcon enhanced shell and has a
nice new text viewer, modules playing and a clever graphical front-end.
There are hundreds of articles to select from covering alsorts of topics from
the useless and mundane to the interesting and important.  This is a demo
coders magazine and it shows in places.  Nice graphics, a smattering of free
software (some of which won't work on the Falcon) and a very nice issue.
Worth getting for a read of a different, more light hearted nature.
