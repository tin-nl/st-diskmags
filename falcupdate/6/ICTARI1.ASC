Dear Atari User,

Thank you for enquiring about the ICTARI Programmers User Group. 
This non-profit making group was started up last year by Nick Bates
in Devon but is now based in Hampshire.  The group was set up for
ATARI programmers to exchange ideas on software, solve programming
problems, help beginners to programming, etc.  We are open to all
programmers of any ability, we have beginners and experts alike, in
any language from machine code to Pascal.

We send out a disk magazine each month containing programming tips,
source code in most languages, requests for help on software
problems, useful programs for programmers, etc, etc.  The service
itself is completely free, members send us a blank disk each month
and the postage (or the cash equivalent) in return for the next
months disk.

If you are an experienced Atari programmer, the group would very much
value your programming expertise, however, this does not mean that we
would expect you to provide programming articles, tips, etc for each
disk.  If each member only contributes two articles a year we would
have enough material to fill a disk each month and if you decide to
join the group we would hope that you could occasionally send in some
contributions for the magazine.  The sort of material we try to
publish are programming techniques, useful sub-routines, C functions,
Basic procedures, MACROs, etc, etc which would be of interest to
other members.  You may also be able to help other programmers with
software problems and there may be other members who could help you
with a software problem that you may have, after all, even experts
don't always have all the answers.

If you are a beginner to programming or are just starting to learn a
new language we can probably help with any software problems you have
as we often run tutorials on various languages and programming
techniques.  If you have any programming queries, please send them in
(on a disk if possible) so that other members can hopefully provide a
solution for you.

We trust that you will consider becoming a member of the group and
provide some useful input to the magazine occasionally.  If you are
interested perhaps you would fill in and return the enclosed
questionnaire to us at the address above.  To receive the next issue
you will also need to send us a double sided disk together with two
2nd class stamps (or 75p cash for each month that you would like in
future).  Please return these as soon as possible so that we can
place you on our mailing list for the next issue which will be
despatched about the 15th of the month.  Cheques or postal orders
should be made payable to Mr P D Hibbs.  Back issues are also
available for œ1 each.

We hope that you will agree to join the group, we are sure you will
find something of interest on each disk and for just a few pence a
month can you afford to miss out on the chance?  We look forward to
hearing from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully,

Peter D Hibbs

The ICTARI Application form is included elsewhere for your easy
printing and completion.  This seems like a very good group and Peter
informs me he has 8 members with Falcon's already so hopes to run
some Falcon programming tutorials in the future.  Let's give him all
the support we can and if you are even remotely interested then why
not send for an issue of the magazine.
