NEW PRODUCTS
============
Apart from the Graffiti and Fresco video genlocks and Expose
Digitiser, we are currently developing software, namely the ImPro
suite of programs, the DEXtrous Cyber-Iconic File management and the
Thought! ideas processor. [both covered elsewhere in Falcon Update
this month].

We believe this shows our commitment to the entire Atari range of
products, especially as we ensure compatibility of all our products
with the existing Atari ST computers wherever possible.

                               FALCON

We have always supported other developer's products once we are
satisfied they are innovative or offer value for money.  As many of
our existing customers know, we always try to recommend products that
fit the purpose and the pocket, with excellent advice into the
bargain.

                           VIDEO PRODUCTS
                           ==============

GRAFFITI
========
Graffiti combines all the features in one unit for pro-video
mastering.  Fully compatible with all Atari ST and Falcon030
computers means superb quality with a minimum outlay.

Control.  Video can be adjusted independently from the graphic output
by using several controls; 

PAN            Aligns the video image to the monitor
BRIGHTNESS     Alters intensity of the video image in relation to the
               computer graphic.
COLOUR         Alters the colour of the video image to the computer
               graphic.  Can also produce a monochrome video display.
TRANSPARENCY\
OVERLAY        Switches certain colours from being opaque to complete
               transparency.

IMPRO SOFTWARE.  Apart from the superb hardware, the ultra powerful
ImPro Animate software is supplied which combines a fully modular
program with a myriad of features to product excellent text and
graphic overlays for video mastering.  Full control over any
parameter assures the maximum amount of flexibility and versatility
over any effect in use.

TECH SPEC.
Video Input: Composite
Video Output: RGB and Composite
Audio: Pass through from computer
Controls: Pan, Brightness, Colour, Overlay Toggle

IMPRO ANIMATE
=============
The ImPro suite of programs provides a revolutionary approach in
providing fully modular software with infinite expandability using fx
modules.  Unlike conventional shell software, ImPro is designed as a
shell from which any module can be loaded.  These can take the form
of a simple effect up to a complete program, such as ray tracing or
morphing, with the module containing the parameters necessary to
manipulate screen output.

FX MODULES.  Includes fades, wipes and dissolves with fully
adjustable parameters.  Special effects; diagnol, random, square,
curtain and shutter wipes, with rainbow effects if desired.
DISPLAY.  Can switch seamlessly between different resolutions and
palettes, whether an image of text displaying, during a sequence. 
Compatible with all ST and Falcon colour resolutions.
TEXT EDITOR.  Provides as easy method to include text into the
sequence.  A wide range of effects and control parameters can then be
applied such adjustments to font, point size, colour, scroll speed,
direction and rainbow effects.

SUMMARY
     Compatible with all Falcon030, TT030 and ST colour resolutions
     Infinite modularity - further integration with any new effects
     Flexible text editor - bold, italic, outline, light, inverse
     Fully adjustable parameters for any text or picture
     Seamless resolutions and palette switching
     Up to 200 frames in sequence
     Sequence timing to 1\100th of a second.


FRESCO STUDIO VIDEO GENLOCK
===========================
The Fresco Video Genlock goes beyond Graffiti in providing studio
quality with a wide range of manual controls over the video image and
packaged with ImPro Design.  Although designed specifically for the
Atari Falcon in mind, Fresco can nonetheless be adapted for use with
the Atari STE.

Features.  Manual controls are available to adjust the displayed
video image and include colour, brightness, pan, individual control
over RGB signals, overlay toggle and Chromakey.  When used with the
Frex module, Fresco can utilitise standard video equipment to realise
the superb titling and dynamic overlay effects available.


FREX SIGNAL AND EFFECTS MODULE
==============================
The Frex module provides a means to convert composite video and
S-Video signals generated from video equipment to broadcast RGB,
thereby making it suitable for use with Fresco and Expose.

FREX LINK.  A unique feature of the Frex module is that images
generated from the Expose can also be displayed in Real Time through
Fresco.
IMPRO DESIGN.  As with all our video products, Fresco comes supplied
with another version of ImPro, in this case called Design, which is
specifically designed for the Falcon to provide True Colour
overscanned displays.  IMPRO DESIGN includes fx modules such as
Exotic titling (Marble, Glass, Chrome, etc.), Vector manipulation, 3D
effects, etc.


DA'S VEKTOR
===========
A Vector Art program that supports 24-bit (16.7 million) colour
images.  Although ideally suited to the Falcon, DA's Vektor will
operate quite happily on any Atari ST or TT computer having a minimum
of 2MB memory, screen resolution of 640x400 and any high resolution
graphic card including Titan's own Reflex Card.

VECTOR GRAPHICS EDITOR.  Creation of objects using straight or Bezier
curves.  Objects can be scaled, rotated, projected onto 3 dimensional
grids and\or mathmatically transformed.  The extrusion feature allows
user defined depth, light source, and shading, all in full colour.

Vectorised objects can be filled with half-tone or colour pictures. 
Very powerful Copy and Repeat utility to transform objects with
varying angle, size and colour.

VECTOR TEXT.  CFN or Postscript Type 1 fonts can be used to input
vector text onto circular or pre-defined vector paths of any shape or
form.

AUTO TRACER.  Automatically vectorises half-tone or colour pictures
of any size.  Vectorisation can be weighted for individual colour
ranges, to define separate areas.

CHART GENERATION.  Graphically presents statistics with pie charts,
2D or 3D bar charts and self defined vector objects.

ANIMATION.  Vector animation editor for video titling.  Automatic
calculation of animation sequences.  Movie player program for
independent use away from DA's Vektor.

ONLINE HELP.  Simply position pointer over any icon and press the
<Help> key!

Interfaces a powerful 68030 processor running at 32MHz - virtually
doubling the speed of your Falcon.


MIGHTY SONIC 32

Similar to the Eagle Sonic, with the exception that up to 24MB of
Fast TT RAM can be fitted, thereby increasing performance and
productivity.


68882 CO-PROCESSOR
==================
Direct plug in fitment for the Atari Falcon.  Speeds up processing
greatly for when a program does a lot of "number crunching". 
Programs which typically take advantage of maths co-processors are
ray tracers.


NVDI v2.5
=========
The latest incarnation of the renowned software accelerator reaches
version 2.5, and in doing so provides full compatibility with all ST,
TT and Falcon computers.  "Invaluable" - FALCON UPDATE.


FALCON SPEED
============
The Atari is an ideal machine for all forms of computing, but there
may be times when the need arises to access software, or conform to
the standards, of other computers.  Rather than clutter your desktop
with two (or even three?) keyboards, why not have everything inside
one box - namely the Atari.  PC emulation provides access to a wide
range of DOS and Windows software, and the Apple Mac is strong in the
printing industry.

Falcon speed tech specs:

16MHz 80286 processor
Access to 8MB RAM with Windows
Norton Factor of 12
Sound Support
Emulation of many graphic modes
Easy installation
