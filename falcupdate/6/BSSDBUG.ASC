BSS Debug - Symbolic 68030 Debugger for the Atari Falcon

Custom WIMP Interface
---------------------
     Fast in operation and simple to use.  Keyboard shortcuts
available for virtually all functions, while adhering to the HiSoft's
MON keyboard controls wherever possible.

Superb Compatibility
--------------------
     Handles standard Atari format labels and the widely used HiSoft
extended debug format for labels up to 22 characters long.  New
labels can be added at any time in a debugging session.  Allows a
default equate label table to be generated when first loading BSS
Debug and can create tables for when items, such as the Atari
hardware register locations, need displaying during program
disassembly.

Transparent Operation
---------------------
     Completely invisable to the application being debugged. 
Applications can run in a completely different resolution from the
debugger making it ideal for debugging custom programs such as games.

Label Completion
----------------
     Single keystroke performs an intelligent search and replace for
the full label name with an intelligent guess for the correct label
if not exact match is found, accounting for when the full name cannot
be recalled.

Watch Windows & Breakpoints
---------------------------
     Watches can be placed at any time on the contents of labeled
memory locations, displayed as an ASCII string, bytes, word, longs
and pointer indirection.  Allows powerful breakpoints using counters
and\or expressions.

Powerful Expression Handler
---------------------------
     Mathmatical equations can be typed into any dialogue requiring a
numerical input.

CPU register highlighting
-------------------------
     Highlights register changes in the CPU Register Window, from the
last executing part of the program.

Custom memory handler
---------------------
     Inspection of any memory location between 0 and $ffffffff of the
memory map with indication of memory locations that cannot be read. 
Can inspect hardware configuartion registers without crashing and
permits debugging of programs loaded into virtual memory.

A unique product
----------------
     Easy and simple to use control system with support for any
language using access to XBIOS system traps.  Allows debugged program
to interact with BSS Debug and user programs can enable any type of
breakpoint and implement variables within the Watch Window.
