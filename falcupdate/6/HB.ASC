FALCON SCREEN RESOLUTIONS
=========================

One major problem I had when making my programs was detecting which damn 
screen resolution the user was loading my programs in.  Could they be in 
a weird True Colour resolution?  If they have a VGA do they have the 
Double Line On or Off ?  All these questions and no obvious answer made 
me fiddle around and here is what I found...


SYSTAB & GETREZ%
================

Both these calls are supposed to be used independantly, but with the 
amount of resolutions on the Falcon it makes sense to combine their 
results to find out the correct resolution and warn the user 
accordingly.

r%=peekw(systab)
g%=getrez%

The above are the methods used from within HB.  You will need to have 
the Xbios library installed for the getrez command to work or else it 
will return a value of 0 each time regardless.


VGA WARNING
===========

I am yet to test my results on a RGB monitor or indeed TV should that be 
any different, so for the meantime here are the results as tested on a 
Samsung VGA.


RESULTS!

Falcon Resolution                SYSTAB    GETREZ
-------------------------------------------------
4 colour, 40 column, DL Off        2         7
4 colour, 80 column, DL Off        2         2
4 colour, 40 column, DL On         2         0
4 colour, 80 column, DL On         2         1

16 colour, 40 column, DL Off       4         7
16 colour, 80 column, DL Off       4         2
16 colour, 40 column, DL On        4         0
16 colour, 80 column, DL On        4         1

256 colour, 40 column, DL Off      8         7
256 colour, 80 column, DL Off      8         2
256 colour, 40 column, DL On       8         0
256 colour, 80 column, DL On       8         1

True Colour, 40 column, DL Off     16        7
True Colour, 40 column, DL On      16        0

ST LOW                             4         0
ST MED                             2         1
ST HIGH                            1         2


THAT'S IT!
==========

I am sure you can see from the above table that when you check the 
systab and getrez results if they equal 16 and 7 then the user is in the 
True Colour, 40 column, Double Line Off mode... and so on...


PROBLEM
=======

There is only one problem though.  The ST LOW results (4/0) are the same 
as the 16 colour, 40 column, Double Line On (4,0).  This is because 
essentially they are the same screen dimensions but you still might like 
to know which one of the two it is.  Well I can't help you here I am 
afraid but if anyone out there can then PLEASE get in touch!
