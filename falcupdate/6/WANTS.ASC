                             =======
                             WANTED!
                             =======

We want YOUR programs to include in our growing library of PD disks.
We will swap programs on a one for one ratio, we don't mind if they
are you own or if you have copied them from somewhere else, if it is
Falcon related then please send it to us for exchange.

If possible it would be helpful if you could send us details of the
programs (perhaps by email) before sending disks to make sure we
don't swap any titles we both already have.

So look through our catalogue and choose some disks in exchange for
any programs you have that we don't.  We want them all.  But they
MUST be Falcon specific, not just ST programs that happen to work on
the Falcon.  Anything from Calamus fonts to new games.

If you have written a program yourself then send it to us and we will
exchange it for TWO disks of your choice, if it is of a really high
quality we will send you even more disks free and if its REALLY good
we will pay you for it (especially if you manage to squeeze our
address into the program somewhere!).

I am always on the look out for the latest programs, pictures,
modules, samples, utilities and more.  If you would like to start
swapping then send me your list today.
