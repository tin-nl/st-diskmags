 WHAT ON EARTH?
 ==============

 You may be wondering just exactly 'what' FOGNET is.   Well,  I  wouldn't 
blame you!   It was created in the early months of August 1994 to try and 
get members of the Falcon Owners Group (FOG) to place some feedback  into 
the club,  ask a few questions,  perhaps supply some answers,  etc..   In 
general to get a mini network established and all you have to do in order 
to  participate  in this network is to own a copy of  our  disk  magazine 
FALCON UPDATE.  Each issue we will publish the latest FOGNET files so you 
can (hopefully) read about the plights and comments the other members put 
forward,  contribute  yourself and generally enjoy a  slightly  different 
system than a normal 'letters page'.


 YOUR PERS FILE
 ==============

  The FOGNET program will check the current directory for a  file  called 
FOGNET.PRS.   This file should contain a few pieces of information  about 
yourself  so as to avoid you having to type it in every time you run  the 
program.   If  this file does not exist you will be prompted to create  a 
new  one.   The  different between having your alias and your  real  name 
tagged  on your messages is like having anonymous messages  for  whatever 
reason.   If  you  ever wish to change anything in the  PRS  file  simply 
delete it from disk and let the FOGNET software make you a new one.


 GROUPS
 ======

  As I type there are currently 6 main groups,  these have names such  as 
COMP.FALCON.DEMOS   In this particular group I am hoping for  members  to 
discuss any new demos they have seen,  comment on them,  compare them and 
generally  talk-demos.   Another group such as FOG.FILMS is a  much  more 
casual  affair,  nothing to do with computers at all, it is an open arena 
for  your  comments  and  mini reviews of any films  you  may  have  seen 
recently.   I feel this mix of computer and entertainment related  topics 
will be successful.


 MAKING A NEW GROUP
 ==================

 The FOGNET software was written to be flexible so as to allow for a  new 
group to be created within a matter of minutes,  not hours.   If you have 
any suggestions for titles of new groups then please send them to me with 
few  sample messages to get the group started.   If it proves popular  it 
will stay, otherwise I'll stop it after a few months.  Like everything in 
life it depends on feedback from other users.


 FOGNET SOFTWARE
 ===============

  The software used to read the FOGNET files and enter your own  messages 
is  rather basic at the moment.   This is because I have a lot  of  other 
work to do right now.   However if this scheme proves popular then I will 
update  the software considerably with a nice GEM interface  and  various 
search and print options.   But you will have to pester me (or leave me a 
message in COMP.FALCON.GENERAL) if you want to see this happen.

The software as it stands will work on ANY Falcon set-up,  from TOS  4.01 
machines up to 4.04 with 1 meg of memory or 14 meg.  With a hard drive or 
without.   Please  note if you are running this from disk you  MUST  make 
sure the disk is write enabled (ie you can't see through the little hole) 
or else the program will crash when trying to save your own messages.

The best resolution on a VGA is 16 colour, 80 column, Double Line Off.
The  best resolution on a TV or RGB is 16 colour,  80  column,  Interlace 
Off.

I would recommend having a directory called FOGNET on your hard drive and 
copying the software and message updates to it as required.


 FOG-ED v1.1
 ===========

  FOG-ED is the small program built into the FOGNET shell that  lets  you 
enter  your own messages.   It is invoked when you either {e}nter  a  new 
message  or {r}eply to one already posted.   Using FOG-ED is very  simple 
(not least of which because it's a simple program!).  You are request for 
the  person you wish to send your message to if you have {e}ntered a  new 
one, this can be a persons full name or 'All' which means it is addressed 
to everyone.   If you have replied to a message this section will already 
be filled in for you.   Next you can enter a Subject to talk about,  this 
can be anything and you one line in which to enter it.  You don't want to 
write too much here really.   If you have {r}eplied to a message then the 
subject field will adopt that of the original message.

Once  these details are complete you will be prompted with a > symbol  on 
the left hand side of the screen.  This is your cue to start entering the 
text.   You _MUST_ press RETURN at the end of each line or it will  cause 
problems  for  both  you and the editor.   Once you  have  finished  your 
message all you have to do is enter a single fullstop (.) on a blank line 
to save the message.

It will be appended to a file called FEEDBACK.XXX (where XXX is the group 
number you have contributed to).   Once you have read all the messages in 
all  the  groups  and  finished your replies you must  send  us  all  the 
FEEDBACK.XXX files that have been created in order for us to add them  to 
the message base for the next issue.

You  can either email us the files,  compile them all into one text  file 
and make sure they are compiled in order (ie 001,002,003 etc..) and  send 
them to:  requiem@armory.com with the subject as 'FEEDBACK'.   Or you can 
send them on a disk (preferably along with some other new PD software) to 
the usual FOG Bristol address, if you enclose a stamp we will return your 
disk full to the brim with new PD software.


 THAT'S ALL FOLKS
 ================

 Well that really is all there is to it.   Go on, give it a try for a few 
issues  at least and see what happens.   You never know it  could  become 
massive and you could learn a lot from the issues raised in FOGNET.   But 
it will *only* succeed with your help.   It doesn't take long to place  a 
disk in an envelope and post it to us and like I said if you send a stamp 
you'll send a huge bundle of free PD back again.

Thanks to the beta-testers (and ones who I hope have started FOGNET  off) 
including :- Xenon, Colin FisherMcAllum, Chris Holland & John Knight.


 DISCLAIMER
 ==========

 The FOGNET software has been extensively tested and should work fine  in 
most Falcon set-ups.   It is known to work under NVDI without any hassles 
and also with programs like DeskTracker playing music in the  background.  
We have done everything possible to make it as friendly as we  could,  of 
course we will update it as time goes on, but only at your request.

The FOGNET software is (C)Copyright 1994 The Falcon Owners Group and  MAY 
NOT  be sold in any public domain library or placed on any BBS system  or 
Internet FTP site without our written permission.

FOGNET was developed in HiSoft Basic 2.10 on a 4meg Falcon030 with 85 meg 
IDE hard drive and VGA monitor.
