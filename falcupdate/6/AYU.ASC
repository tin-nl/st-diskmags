                         ATARI     YAMAHA    USER

                        REVIEWED BY JAMES L. MATHEWS


ATARI  YAMAHA  USER  is a fairly new disk magazine  produced  by  two  guys, 
Graeme and Mel and as the title suggests,  it is aimed at ST owners who  are 
also lucky enough to own a MIDI compatible Yamaha keyboard.  

The  disk is packed to the brim with a whole variety of things.   There  are 
MIDI  files,  MIDI  programs and P.D.  releases which will aid  MIDI  users.  
There are also a few text files which consist of an introductions,  a  hints 
and  tips  page  and the like.   There are also a few  articles  which  help 
explain  certain MIDI aspects and so on.   Sadly there is no text viewer  so 
the  files  have  to  be read through the desktop but  the  content  of  the 
articles is quite good and will be very helpful to MIDI users.

The  disk magazine comes out once every two months although by 1995  at  the 
latest, the magazine could well be released on a monthly basis.  At present, 
the disk magazine is not in the P.D.,  it can only be obtained directly from 
the  head  quaters (contact information coming up) for a nominal  charge  of 
œ2.50.   Alternatively  you  can subscribe with  a  slight  discount.   Full 
details are in the magazine itself.

What with articles,  hints and tips,  MIDI files,  dumps and lots more, this 
magazine would,  although not very interesting for a non-MIDI user,  is idea 
for anyone with a Yamaha keyboard.   As far as I know, this is the only disk 
magazine  on  the  ST  of  its  kind and as  it  is  produced  by  two  real 
enthusiasts,  it should be around for quite a while.  At present, it is only 
aimed  at  Yamaha keyboard owners but the disk magazine may  diversify  into 
other  makes of keyboard in time.   There is also a tutorial  section  which 
should  prove  useful.   The disk mag helps both experts and  beginners  and 
would  be an ideal way to ease yourself into the P.D.  scene and MIDI  scene 
both at the same time.

It's a well put together disk magazine and well worth getting if you have  a 
MIDI set up.  If you would like a copy or would like more information, write
