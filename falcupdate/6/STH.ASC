HANDY THAT!

You may remember a few issues back I mentioned a publication in the
news pages called the ST HANDBOOK.  Well I have been able to obtain
all the issues to date and having sat down one rainy monday afternoon
I read through them all... this is what I found....

ST HANDBOOK, Price œ2.00p

Issue 1.  I guess in this consumer based world of ours the first
issue of something is always the one that makes the most impact.  The
ST Handbook team obviously planned for this and it has paid off well.
The front cover is printed in a nice glossy card with good use of
colour to enhance it.  The cover is actually rather bland for issue
one, however the contents are not.

There is a very good feature on Page 6 Publishing covering the roots
of the ST PD and Shareware scene and more.  There is a brief and
rather non-sensical 'interview' with Merlin PDL, a very good public
domain and shareware review section, a top 10 PD and shareware list,
a brilliant article on STOS and the Atari communities views on it
(well done Keefy!), lots of nice little snippets and news releases
and of course the adverts.  The cover disk supplied was a rather
strange affair and the programs were packed with an archiver that
refused to run on the Falcon without the aid of Backward.  The
programs given away included World Fighting Championship, a nice
little GFA written beat-em-up, the latest version of the excellent
Revenge Doc Displayer, Fast Copy 3, Manual Maker (inc GDOS) and a
little general purpose utility called James.  You will be pleased to
know that all the programs worked on the Falcon, either in one of the
ST screen modes or under Backward.  I doubt they planned for this but
it certainly makes the whole disk seem much nicer!

In my opinion there was a lot of space wasted in issue one that could
have been put to better use, but the articles that were supplied were
of top quality.

Issue 2 was the April and May issue and things were certainly getting
better.  The front cover retained its colour and introduced some
rather nice sci-fi graphics, the usual article to advert ration
applies and the guy DTP'ing the fanzine with Calamus shows off yet
more of his font tricks and nice shading.  The contents include a
superb article on David Hardy, a professional and rather famous
science fiction artist (and also a Falcon owning FOG member!).  An
introduction to Clip Art (only for REAL beginners!), an overview of
Wizard PD giving them a chance to express why they think they are the
best ST PD library around, even though they say 'it (the Falcon) has
been available for a while now and seems doomed to follow the TT and
Mega ST into the niche market'.  Oh dear Wizard, can I suggest
looking into your crystal ball a little closer?  That aside Andy
Morgan gives a good talk on his view of ST Shareware programming. 
There are (as usual) a good selection of quality reviews of PD
software including good screenshots.  A feature on Fishing and your
ST (!) and its better than it sounds, a brief letters page, a useless
hints and cheats page, more top 10 disks, a fantastic article about
Dunces Cap software, discussion of the Shareware concept, plenty of
news and snippets and the second part of the cartoon strip - the ST
Ranger.

Wait a minute did I say cartoon?  Well yes, the ST Handbook team seem
to think you'd be interested in one and a half pages of amauterishly
drawn semi sci-fi strips.  I could be wrong, you _could_ be
interested, but I feel that with a great little magazine like this
the space is wasted.

Issue 2's cover disk contains that age old shoot-em-up - Cybernetix -
which I think just about every Atari owner has a copy of, second to
Llamatron that is.  There is also an STE CD Player, which is actually
a module player with a cd like interface.  A crossword generator with
plenty of sample puzzles included, D-Term a decent comms package,
Demolition Man a version of Minesweeper, some help files for Knife
ST, a virus killer, some boot sector programs and screen savers.
Well every program (except the boot sector ones) work fine on the
Falcon, a no nasty depacking this time either.

Things are picking up, issue 2 is a good improvement over the first
issue, a more economical use of space is employed and it has an
increasingly professional feel to it.

Issue three did everything to confirm to me that the ST Handbook is a
truly great publication.  I mentioned it in passing a few issues ago
but having explored this issue deeper I would just like to point out
that you should get in on this as soon as possible.  Order a copy
from them, be surprised at the nice selection of software on the
cover disk, read the articles and feel a whole lot closer to the
Atari scene.  There is virtually no Falcon information to be found,
but I wouldn't call this a ST publication either as the feedback and
articles seem to come more from the users of the machines, no matter
which type, and have a very 'community' feel to them.  If they would
only drop the cartoon and cheats sections there could be another 2
pages of articles.

I am constantly amazed at the strength of the Atari community, there
is so much enthusiasm out there just waiting to be supported.  Real
dedicated Atarians giving up their time to make disk magazines and
fanzines for their friends, ie other Atari owners.  It's about damn
time that we all started to contribute back and put something into
the Atari world instead of complaining about its demise.  Contact ST
Handbook, send them articles, suggest your friends buy copies and
feel proud of yourself.

I for one will pat you on the back, move up from the realms of
consumer into the wonderful world of contributer.  Get your name in
lights (or at least in print!) and relish your moment of glory.
