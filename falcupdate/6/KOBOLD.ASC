HIGH SPEED FILE COPIER: KOBOLD v2.5

With Kobold, the Atari platform now has an uncommonly efficient high
powered utility at it's disposal.

Apart from its proficiency as a file copier, Kobold also serves as a
helping hand when any small or larger tasks related to mass storage
arise.

If you have Kobold installed as an accessory, or are working in a
multitasking environment, Kobold can be called 'on the fly' to format
a floppy disk in any possible format.  You can delete, rename or
manipulate masses of files and folders in many ways - all at speeds
unheard of by the operating system.  A script language allows
automation of routine tasks.

With the aid of MagiC, MultiTOS, Gemini or Ease, desktop functions
such as copy, delete, format and move can be passed seamlessly to
Kobold.  This allows you to carry on using your default desktop in
the normal way, but with the power of Kobold hidden away to actually
perform the disk functions.

*  Works with all Atari ST(E)\TT\Falcon computers with a screen
   resolution of 640x200 (ST Medium) or higher.

*  Kobold's main control panel is a true GEM window.  Kobold is
   compatible with all large screens (including Overscan) and
   graphics cards.

*  All file operations are implemented.  Copy, Delete, Move, Format,
   Create Folder, Rename files\folders, Manipulate file attributes...

*  Kobold is completely compatible with multitasking systems (e.g.
   MagiC, MultiTOS...) and is quite happy to work in the background.

*  Kobold's fully configurable format routines are able to create any
   possible format on any TOS computer.  Not only DD and HD formats,
   but also ED (Extended Density) with up to 3.3 Mb capacity.

*  By way of the option 'minimum memory', Kobold is always available
   (as an accessory) even it other applications normally grab all
   available memory.

*  Comprehensive functions for logical selection of files according
   to various criteria e.g. dates, file attributes, extensions...

*  Particular drives can alternatively be accessed via GEMDOS -
   Kobold thus supports all possible media e.g. Network partitions,
   CD-ROM or MO drives...

*  Batch files (called jobs) can perform repetitive tasks
   automatically.. You just need a simple text editor to create them;
   or simply let Kobold take note of your actions and record them in
   a job file.

*  Contains special support for incremental backups to removeable
   hard disks or similar media.  Several hundred megabytes can be
   updated within a few minutes because only new or changed files
   will be written to the existing backup.

*  Kobold's unique handling of the Atari file system gives unrivalled
   speed when copying, moving and deleting files.  See table for some
   results.

*  Easy to install.  Installation program included.

*  Comes with a very detailed 74 page paperback manual.

* Kobold is available now for œ49.95 inc. VAT.
