War Is Virtual Hell
*******************

The Cold War is over. Military budgets are slashed. But it's still a
cruel, hostile world out there. How to get more bang for the buck? If
you're the US military, the answer is to build ever smarter weapons, and
be prepared to use them by training hard. In cyberspace. How effective is
that strategy? Ask the Iraqis. Or Bruce Sterling, who returns from the
electronic battlefield with a report on the evermore lethal future of war
in the global village.

By Bruce Sterling


The First Company of the 12th Armored Cavalry Regiment prepared for
virtual battle.

At the Combined Arms and Tactical Training Center (CATTC) in Fort Knox,
Ky., the troops prepared to enter SIMNET - a virtual war delivered via
network links. With the almost Disney-like mimicry typical of SIMNET
operations, the warriors were briefed in an actual field command-post,
with folding camp-stools, fly swatters, and stenciled jerry cans. The
young tankers wore green- and-brown forest camouflage fatigues, black
combat boots, and forage caps.

Their command-post canvas tent was pitched inside the giant CATTC barn,
right in the midst of silent rows of plastic tank simulators.

The Americans listened to a British officer on NATO exchange, Maj. Rogers,
a two-year veteran of Fort Knox's simulator network. The major wore
British olive-green, with rolled sleeves and gold-crowned epaulets and a
Union Jack at the shoulder. He swiftly explained the tactical situation
with deft scribbles on the plastic overlay covering a large topographical
map.

Today's engagement would take place in a digital replica of California's
Mojave Desert, the bleak, much-mangled terrain that is the heavy-armor
stomping grounds of the US Army's National Training Center. Thanks to the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Defense Mapping
Agency, and the Army's Topographic Engineering Center, the US military's
vast Mojave acreage had been replicated virtually. The virtual Mojave is
now available for daily use even in distant Fort Knox (and in an
increasing number of other simulation centers around the planet).

The NTC's Mojave was a very harsh terrain, a hell of a place to lose a cow
or to throw a tank track, and today it was worse yet, because it was
swarming with the Opposing Forces.

The Threat were on their way in overwhelming numbers. Their assault force
was four times larger than the beleaguered Americans, and they were
blitzkrieging headlong in Soviet T-72 heavy tanks and mechanized
transports.

The unlucky One-Twelve Cav were to take their initial stand in the
ruggedly digitized Mojave hills on a baseline code-named Purple. Their
orders were to fight in their sector, delaying the advance as best they
could, while retreating in good order to Baseline Amber, where the
survivors (if there were any) were to take another stand.

The attacking enemy would advance from west to east. That much was already
known. But the exact enemy tactics were obscured by the fog of war.

The US company commander, Capt. Van Aken, studied the terrain and deployed
his meager forces with care. Alpha Platoon to guard the center. Bravo
Platoon to the north. Charlie Platoon to the south. The command post to
the rear, near Baseline Amber. And the scouts, in their swift but lightly
armored Bradleys, to range ahead of Baseline Purple.

The One-Twelve Cav had their orders. They understood their strategy. They
left the command post for the squat plastic ranks of simulators. The
Jacuzzis of Death.

From the outside, a SIMNET M1 Abrams tank simulator is clearly not a tank.
It looks like an oddly humped gray fiberglass shower-stall. The simulator
is, in fact, built by Jacuzzi from the same materials as a whirlpool bath.
Its interior, however, is designed to psycho-logically replicate the basic
tank experience, and it does.

Inside, the simulator is the proper shape and size for a tank's crew
chamber. It makes all the proper sounds: the loud engine whine, the
ominous rumble of treads, the multi-ton coffee-grinder racket as the
turret slews, the concussive thud of the main gun firing. It has the
instruments of a tank, though many of those controls are nonfunctional and
only painted-on. There are no actual 40-pound high-explosive shells inside
simulators, though the loader, by design, must still go through the
physical motions of cramming them into the cannon, with all the proper
timing, proper footwork, and the proper clanks and thuds.

A real M1 Abrams battle tank is a nightmarish vehicle. It weighs 70 tons.
It's 26 feet long and 12 feet wide. It carries a 120-millimeter cannon
that fires rounds that travel a mile-per-second: high-explosive shells, or
armor-piercing uranium slugs. The M1 tank can climb obstacles three feet
high with no trouble, cross ditches eight feet wide with ease, and roar
down roads at 42 mph. It is an extremely lethal and frightening machine
that can kill anything it can see.

It is also a horrible place in which to die. The Abrams holds four men.
Three of them (the tank commander, the gunner, and the loader) ride in the
crew chamber which is about the size of a large bedroom closet. The tank
commander sits on a swivel-seat with his knees at the upper back of the
gunner, who is crammed into a tiny ergonomic nook. The loader heaves
shells into the butt of the 120-millimeter cannon, which juts like a
dinosaur's rump into the turret cavity. The fourth man, the driver, lies
on his back in a padded niche much the size and shape of a coffin. He
steers the tank with a pivoting pair of black rubber handles from a metal
post over his belly. He is not inside the turret with the other men;
instead, he is squirreled away into the bowels of the machine and
communicates by headset. Like the commander and the gunner, the driver's
view of the world comes through "vision blocks," three rectangular blocks
each the size and shape of a rear-view mirror.

Almost every visible surface within the chamber is covered with readout
screens, switches, sensors, gauges, and maintenance monitors. The area
around the tank commander's tall black stool has a weirdly shaped black
joystick, a targeting scope, and two flat screens with buttons bearing
cryptic acronyms. These big square buttons are designed to be pressed by
hands encased in chemical-warfare gauntlets. They're like a lethal parody
of the child-sized buttons on a My First Sony.

Tanks are, of course, very well-armored vehicles, but there is very little
on earth that can resist a 120-millimeter uranium slug traveling at a
mile-per-second. Anything hit by this projectile instantly buckles and
splatters. Modern tank-to-tank warfare is extremely lethal and the
exchange of direct fire generally lasts only seconds.

Those seconds are precious, so time spent inside a simulator is not a
picnic. Simulators are not toys. They are "fun" in some sense, but only
about as much fun as an actual no-kidding tank. You can drive these
simulators across cyberspace landscapes, coordinate their tactics, advance
and retreat, aim their cannon, fire and be fired upon. You can smash into
obstacles, bog down in mud, fall off cliff edges, and experience various
kinds of simulated mechanical and engine trouble. You can panic, you can
screw up, you can make a fool of yourself in front of your comrades and
your commander. You can directly affect your real-life military career
through what you do in simulators. And you can be killed inside simulators
- virtually speaking.

The One-Twelve Cav deployed to their virtual tanks, opened the thick
plastic doors on their hefty refrigerator-style hinges, took their posts
at the black plastic seats, and were sealed inside. The drivers were also
formally encased in their own separate plastic sarcophagi.

They started their virtual engines. They began exchanging virtual radio
traffic. They examined their virtual navigation, and squinted at the
desert-colored polygons in their vision-blocks. From the Ethernet lines
dangling from metal frames overhead, SIMNET packets began to flow to and
from the gloss-black Computer Image Generators, and the SIMNET recording
angel, the big network machine they called "Radcliff," started to monitor
the battle.

In another area of the simulator barn, the wily Threat commander brooded
over his color Macintosh. Capt. Baker, a US Marine tactical instructor on
loan to Fort Knox, was taking on the entire American force
single-handedly. The Yankee opposition were sealed inside their
simulators, gazing nervously at the pixelated desert and jockeying for
position. But Baker could see the entire landscape at a glance. His
on-screen map showed red roads, yellow badlands, the milling icons of the
blue Friendlies, and the red lozenges of his own approaching Threat task
force, rumbling forward west of Baseline Purple.

Capt. Baker followed Soviet tactical doctrine scrupulously. He gave his
unmanned, computer-generated tanks and armored vehicles their instructions
with deft points-drags-and-clicks of his Macintosh mouse.

His strategy was to spot or create a weakness in the Yankee defenses, pour
as much of his armor through the chink as possible, then roll at
blitzkrieg speed to a target deep behind enemy lines: "Objective Kiev."

Capt. Baker coolly sent three groups of digital scouts to certain death.

In the north, Bravo Platoon was the first to spot the approaching enemy
scouts. Three Bravo tanks lurched suddenly from ambush and blasted the
mechanized transports into smoking digital wreckage. The dying transports
took a posthumous vengeance, though, by calling in an artillery
bombardment on the Yankee position. Bravo Platoon saw red and yellow
impacts spike their hillside landscape, and a vicious crump of high
explosives burst from the Perceptronics audio simulators.

A second enemy probe tried the center of the American line. Alpha Platoon
called in a hasty artillery strike of their own against the enemy
reconnaissance. Unfortunately, the map coordinates were badly garbled in
the growing excitement. Lethal "friendly fire" now whumped and blasted
around Alpha Platoon's own scouts. One scout was killed by an enemy
transport; the other shot dead by friendly tanks as it fled into the
trigger-happy muzzles of its own backup units.

By now the radio traffic was going wild. Back at the SIMNET system
operator's omniscient "Stealth Station," every howl and yelp was spooling
onto a cheap K-Mart boombox for later analysis by trainers.

Under the stress of battle, the American chain of command was
disintegrating, and the engagement was becoming a wild scrap.

But one Alpha tank survived. He had found a slope of ground in a sharp
declivity, a sniper's paradise. Inside the simulator, the tank commander
of Alpha Unit 24 began to lacerate the enemy column, rolling back behind
the safety of the virtual ridge, reloading his cannon, then surging up
again to swiftly nail another victim with his laser target reticule. It is
a terrible thing to snipe with a laser-guided 120-mm cannon. Alpha 24 was
methodically tearing the enemy column apart. Within some 30 seconds four
enemy vehicles were reduced to burning hulks.

The robotic enemy column seemed stunned by Alpha 24's lethal
jack-in-the-box tactic. They milled around in confusion, unable to get a
clear shot. Then the American artillery kicked in, bracketing the column
in lethal fire. With their position absolutely untenable, the column
charged the sniping tank. Alpha 24 killed two more tanks before being
outflanked and forced to retreat.

Bravo Platoon was standing firm in the north, but it had been outfoxed. No
one was coming their way. Instead, two more enemy columns suddenly
appeared in the far south, in Charlie Platoon's turf. Seen through the
Threat commander's Macintosh map, the jittering red icons resembled angry
ants.

Charlie Platoon as a whole was caught unawares. Despite their wire-guided
TOW missiles, Charlie Platoon's Bradley Fighting Vehicles were no match
for the Threat heavy armor. Charlie Platoon was swiftly overwhelmed,
howling through the radio network for backup that was too slow, and too
far away.

Charlie Platoon's survivors called in air-support as they struggled to
reach the relative safety of Baseline Amber. In answer, two automatic
Apache attack helicopters emerged from the blue nothingness of SIMNET's
cyberspace sky. They fired air-to-surface missiles and swiftly roasted a
pair of enemy tanks; but the other T-72 tanks potted both the choppers on
the wing. The Apaches fell in crumpled digital heaps of flaming polygons.

As the engagement proceeded, dead men began to show up in the CATTC video
classroom. Inside the simulators, their vision blocks had gone suddenly
blank with the onset of virtual death. Here in CATTC's virtual Valhalla,
however, a large Electrohome video display unit showed a comprehensive
overhead map of the entire battlefield. Group by group, the dead tank
crews filed into the classroom and gazed upon the battlefield from a
heavenly perspective.

Slouching in their seats and perching their forage caps on their knees,
they began to talk. They weren't talking about pixels, polygons,
baud-rates, Ethernet lines, or network architecture. If they'd felt any
gosh-wow respect for these high-tech aspects of their experience, those
perceptions had clearly vanished early on. They were talking exclusively
about fields of fire, and fall-back positions, and radio traffic and
indirect artillery strikes. They weren't discussing "virtual reality" or
anything akin to it. These soldiers were talking war.

"Get them, sir," a deceased tanker muttered vengefully as he watched Alpha
24's heroic stand in the fake Mojave Hills. Another tanker, from the Alpha
scout unit, griped bitterly about his death by friendly fire:
"fratricide." Dying at the hands of his own platoon had been especially
cruel. It was clear that the real-life lesson of unit coordination had
sunk in well - at least for this poor guy.

"It's only SIMNET," another tanker told him at last. "You're not bleeding."

They weren't bleeding. That was undeniable. On the contrary, they'd just
been killed in combat, yet also had the amazing luxury to learn by this
experience. The CATTC trainers called off the battle in time for lunch;
the result was now a foregone conclusion. As Capt. Baker explained to his
virtual enemies and real-life students, "There'll be hot borscht and vodka
at Objective Kiev tonight." The dead soldiers, and the few pleased
survivors, had shakes, fries and burgers from the local Burger King.

 When they returned from their lunch, Maj. Rogers replayed the battle for
them, hitting the high points with detailed graphics from the big machine
called Radcliff. Any event can be scrutinized, from any angle of vision,
at any moment in time that the trainers desired.


Virtual Reality as a Strategic Asset

SIMNET today is a clunky and rapidly aging mid-1980s technology; its
giant, $100,000 image generators are so large that they bear red adhesive
labels: "WARNING: RISK OF PERSONAL INJURY FROM RACK TIPPING FORWARD."
SIMNET still thrives in everyday use at Fort Knox, Fort Rucker, Fort
Denning and a number of other sites, sometimes linked together through
long-distance lines, more often not. But better stuff is coming: faster,
cheaper, more sophisticated, and far better-connected.

The people at the Institute for Defense Analyses know all this. The
Institute is a large, brown, campus-like building set in a pleasant wooded
lot outside the Beltway of Washington, D.C. Its tall brick walls are
festooned with white security telecameras. White shuttle-vans with the IDA
logo - an infinity-sign in a triangle with the IDA acronym - pull up
periodically, disgorging small scholarly groups of tweed-jacketed
military-academic spooks.

I visited the Institute last fall. Groups of Air Force bluesuiters ambled
periodically into the "Stealth Room." "Stealth technology" cloaks
observers in digital invisibility, so that they can travel to any point
inside a simulated battle. A huge triptych of full-color computer screens
showed the simulated activity of a certain weapons system I was forbidden
to identify publicly. The tarpaulin-shrouded chambers within the Institute
were draped with wrist-thick clusters of black cabling leading to Sun
workstations, networked Macintoshes, and a variety of prototype
simulators. Everything hummed.

Col. Jack A. Thorpe, USAF, Ph.D., spends a lot of time in the Institute.
Col. Thorpe is the "Father of Distributed Simulation" and is America's
foremost advocate of virtual reality as a strategic asset.

The Colonel wore a civilian pinstriped suit, an understated maroon tie,
and polished black wingtips. Col. (or Doctor) Thorpe is a cognitive
psychologist specializing in training techniques; he is tall and lean and
bespectacled, with a straight nose, dark hair, and hollow temples, and he
possesses the vigorous air of a man with a vision and clear ideas of how
to get there. He is somewhere near his early forties.

Col. Thorpe's highly unusual expertise makes his position in the military
hierarchy somewhat anomalous. He is a career Air Force officer who
nevertheless pioneered virtual reality networks for the US Army. He is
also the special assistant for simulations at DARPA. He clearly has a lot
of pull at the Institute for Defense Analyses, his institutional home away
from home, where DARPA sponsors the IDA Advanced Distributed Simulation
Laboratory.

Col. Thorpe also has a number of friends among the computer-networking
experts at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, and more
colleagues yet at the Defense Mapping Agency, and yet more in the
Topographic Engineering Center, and plenty of eager listeners from all
over the defense-contracting industry.

And yet Col. Thorpe's primary role in today's USmilitary is as "Leader of
Thrust Six" for the Director of Defense Research and Engineering.

Dr. Victor Reis, Col. Thorpe's immediate superior, is Director of Defense
Research and Engineering. Dr. Reis has a seven-point plan for distributing
$3 billion worth of defense research in fiscal year 1993. The plan
involves fairly standard post-Cold War matters such as global
surveillance, air superiority, precision strikes, and advanced land
combat. But the sixth point in the Reis plan is "Synthetic Environments."

Col. Thorpe is the premier Defense Department evangelist for synthetic
environments. His interest in these matters goes back to the late '70s,
when he was in the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. In those days,
full-scale Air Force jet simulators cost $40 million each. The simulators
- odd devices that perch on hydraulic stilts and pitch and toss their
wannabe-ace occupants like broncos - clearly worked well in
flight-training, but they were clumsy and they cost far too much, and
worst of all, they were not connected.

Col. Thorpe is a connectivity visionary first and foremost.

His reasoning is simple but profound. An army is not an armed mob of
heroic individualists. An army is a connected, coordinated, disciplined
killing force, working systematically in close cooperation to a desired
end. In any stand-up fight, an army will destroy a mob, even an armed and
heroic mob, with very little trouble.

There are two basic problems with isolated simulators. They don't connect
to other soldiers, and they don't connect to an enemy. They might train
individual pilots how to fly very well, but they can't train squadrons how
to fight. They can teach the skill of handling an aircraft, but they can't
teach combat with your own comrades at hand, against an intelligent enemy
who can see you and react to what you do. Similarly, a single tank
simulator might train a single crew to some brilliant pitch of mechanical
efficiency, but it can't build platoons, companies, battalions, or
regiments of armor that can work together, confront enemies, and conquer
the battlefield. Armies win wars, not lone heroes. In real wars, Rambos
die quick.

On a higher level of organization, the same logic of coordination and
networking applies across the individual armed forces. Single branches of
the American military establishment can no longer play the lone-wolf game.
Interservice rivalry (though still very real) is officially out of fashion
in the post-Cold War world of rapid deployment. Maximum speed, maximum
impact, and minimum American casualties all demand that the services be
fully coordinated, that all assets be brought into play in a smooth and
utterly crushing synchrony. Navy ships support land offensives, Air Force
strikes support mud-slogging Marines. And space-based satellite
intelligence, satellite communications, and satellite navigation support
everybody.

That is the core of modern American strategic military doctrine, and that
is what Col. Thorpe's new project, the Distributed Simulation Internet, is
meant to accomplish for the military in the realm of cyberspace.

DARPA is an old hand at computer networking. The original ARPANET of 1969
grew up to become today's globe-spanning civilian-based Internet. SIMNET
was another DARPA war-child, conceived in 1983 and first online in May
1986. DARPA invented SIMNET just as it invented the Internet, but DARPA
spun SIMNET off to the US Army for day-to-day operations.

DARPA, by its nature, sponsors the cutting edge; the bleeding edge. The
Distributed Simulation Internet, projected for the turn of the century, is
to be a creature of another order entirely from SIMNET. Ten thousand
linked simulators! Entire literal armies online. Global, real-time,
broadband, fiber-optic, satellite-assisted, military simulation
networking. Complete coordination, using one common network protocol,
across all the armed services. Tank crews will see virtual air support
flitting by. Jet jockeys will watch Marines defend perimeters on the
pixelated landscape far below. Navy destroyers will steam offshore
readying virtual cruise missiles... and the omniscient eye of trainers
will watch it all.

And not just connected, not just simulated. Seamless. "Seamless
simulation" is probably the weirdest conceptual notion in the arsenal of
military virtuality. The seams between reality and virtuality will be
repeatedly and deliberately blurred. Ontology be damned - this is war!

Col. Thorpe emphasizes this concept heavily. And seamless simulation is
not a blue-sky notion. It's clearly within reach.

Most of the means of human perception in modern vehicles of war are
already electronically mediated. In Desert Storm, both air pilots and tank
crews spent much of their time in combat watching infrared targeting
scopes. Much the same goes for Patriot missile crews, Aegis cruisers,
AWACS radar personnel, and so on. War has become a phenomenon that America
witnesses through screens.

And it is a simple matter to wire those screens to present any image
desired. Real tanks can engage simulator crews on real terrain which is
also simultaneously virtual. Fake threats can show up on real radar
screens, and real threats on fake screens. While the crews in real
machines can no longer tell live from Memorex, the simulators themselves
will move closer to the "scratch and sniff" level of realism.

Granted, simulators still won't fire real shells. "They know how to load
shells," Col. Thorpe points out. "That's not what we're trying to teach
them." What he's trying to teach them, in a word, is networking. The wired
Army, the wired Navy, the wired Air Force and wired Marines. Wired
satellites. Wired simulators. All coordinated. All teaching tactical
teamwork.

A wired Armed Forces will be composed entirely of veterans - highly
trained veterans of military cyberspace. An army of high-tech masters who
may never have fired a real shot in real anger, but have nevertheless
rampaged across entire virtual continents, crushing all resistance with
fluid teamwork and utterly focused, karate-like strikes. This is the
concept of virtual reality as a strategic asset. It's the reasoning behind
SIMNET, the "Mother of All Computer Games." It's modern Nintendo training
for modern Nintendo war.


The War We Won

The walls inside the Institute for Defense Analyses are hung with Kuwaiti
topography. In some entirely virtual, yet final and terrible sense, the
USmilitary now owns Kuwait. The Pentagon has a virtual Kuwait on a hard
disk - SAKI, the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait-Iraq database. It has the country
mapped meter by meter, pixel by pixel, in 3-D, with weather optional. You
can climb into one of Col. Thorpe's tank simulators and you can drive
across that cyberspace doppleganger voodoo Kuwait exchanging gunfire with
the polygonal ghosts of Iraqi T-72 tanks.

There was a war in Kuwait recently. They don't call it "Desert
Shield-Desert Storm" at IDA or DARPA. They certainly don't call it the
"Persian Gulf War" - that would only irritate the Arab coalition allies
who insist on calling that tormented body of water the "Arabian Gulf." No
- they like to call this event "the war in Southwest Asia."

The US military hasn't forgotten Southeast Asia. To hear them talk, you
would think that they had discussed very little else for the 16 long years
between Saigon and Kuwait City. In Southeast Asia the Pentagon sent
Americans into tunnels below the earth to fight peasant guerrillas
hand-to-hand with knives and pistols. They sent soldiers sweeping through
rice paddies in hopes of attracting gunfire from some Viet Cong group
large enough to be spotted from helicopters. As the situation became more
hopeless, they sent in more American flesh to be ambushed and pierced with
punji sticks. The United States lost a major war in Southeast Asia.

However, the US recently won a major war in Southwest Asia. With some
handy but basically political and cosmetic help from its Coalition allies,
the US destroyed the fourth-largest land army on the planet in four days
at a cost of only 148 American dead. Geopolitically, this war may have
been less significant than Vietnam (with almost everybody in the civilized
world versus a clear megalomaniac, victory of some sort was probably not
much in doubt.) Strategically and tactically however, Desert Storm was one
of the most lopsided and significant military victories since Agincourt.
And the American military is quite aware of this.

"Southwest Asia" may have vanished into the blipverse of cable television
for much of the American populace, but the US military has a very long
institutional memory. They will not forget Southwest Asia, and all the
tasty things that Southwest Asia implies, for a long time to come.

Col. Thorpe and his colleagues at DARPA, IDA, and the Army Office of
Military History have created a special Southwest Asian memento of their
very own - with the able help of their standard cyberspace civilian
contractors: Bolt Beranek & Newman and Illusion Engineering. The memento
is called "The Reconstruction of the Battle of 73 Easting."

This battle took place at a map line called 73 Easting in the desert of
southern Iraq. On 26 February 1991, the Eagle, Ghost, and Iron Troops of
the US 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment attacked the Tawakalna Division of the
Iraqi Republican Guard. These were untested UStank troops, without any
previous combat experience, blundering forward in a sandstorm to confront
entrenched Soviet-made heavy tanks manned by elite veterans of an
eight-year war. Thanks to the sandstorm, the Americans had no air support
either; this was a straight-on tank-versus-tank scrap in the desert, right
out of the Rommel and Patton strategic notebook.

The Americans annihilated the Iraqis in 22 minutes.

The Battle of 73 Easting has become the single most accurately recorded
combat engagement in human history. Army historians and simulation
modelers thoroughly interviewed the American participants, and paced the
battlefield meter by meter. They came up with a fully interactive,
network-capable digital replica of the events at 73 Easting, right down to
the last TOW missile and .50-caliber pockmark. Military historians and
armchair strategists can now fly over the virtual battlefield in the
"stealth vehicle," the so-called "SIMNET flying carpet," viewing the 3-D
virtual landscape from any angle during any moment of the battle. They can
even change the parameters - give the Iraqis infrared targeting scopes,
for instance, which they lacked at the time, and which made them sitting
ducks for high-tech American M1s charging out of blowing sand. The whole
triumphal blitzkrieg can be pondered over repeatedly (gloated over even),
in perfect scratch-free digital fidelity. It's the spirit of Southwest
Asia in a digital nutshell. In terms of American military morale, it's
like a '90s CD remix of some '60s oldie, rescued from warping vinyl and
remade closer to the heart's desire.

Col. Thorpe and his colleagues first demo'd "73 Easting" in late 1991 at
the Interservice/Industry Training Systems and Education Conference
(I/ITSEC) #13, the premier convention for the military training,
simulation, and VR industry. The virtual battle was the hit of the show,
and it went on to tour the Senate Armed Services Committee, where it much
impressed Sam Nunn and John Glenn.

"The Reconstruction of the Battle of 73 Easting" is an enormously
interesting interactive multimedia creation. It is fast and exhilarating
and full of weird beauty. But even its sleek, polygonal, bloodless
virtuality is a terrifying thing to witness and to comprehend. It is
intense and horrific violence at headlong speed, a savage event of
grotesque explosive precision and terrible mechanized impacts. The flesh
of real young men was there inside those flam- ing tank-shaped polygons,
and that flesh was burning.

That is what one knows - but it's not what one sees. What one really sees
in "73 Easting" is something new and very strange: a complete and utter
triumph of chilling, analytic, cybernetic rationality over chaotic,
real-life, human desperation.

Battles have always been unspeakable events, unknowable and mystical.
Besides the names of the dead, what we get from past historical battles
are confused anecdotes, maybe a snapshot or two, impressions pulled from a
deadly maelstrom that by its very nature could not be documented
accurately. But DARPA's "Battle of 73 Easting" shows that day is past
indeed. The omniscient eye of computer surveillance can now dwell on the
extremes of battle like a CAT scan detailing a tumor in a human skull.
This is virtual reality as a new way of knowledge: a new and terrible kind
of transcendent military power.



A Virtual Military/Industrial Complex?

What is it that Col. Thorpe and his colleagues really want? Well, of
course, they want the unquestioned global military pre-eminence of the
American superpower. Of course, they want to fulfill their patriotic duty
in the service of the United States and its national interests. They want
to win honor and glory in the defense of the American republic. Those are
givens. Col. Thorpe and his colleagues already work to those ends every
day.

What they really want is their own industrial base.

They want the deliberate extension of the American military-industrial
complex into the virtual world. They want a wired, digitized,
military-post-industrial complex, reformed and recreated to suit their own
terms and their own institutional interests.

They want a pool of contractors and a hefty cadre of trained civilian
talent that they can draw from at need. They want professional Simulation
Battle Masters. Simulation system operators. Simulation site managers.
Logisticians. Software maintenance people. Digital cartographers. CAD-CAM
designers. Graphic designers.

And it wouldn't break their hearts if the American entertainment industry
picked up on their interactive simulation network technology, or if some
smart civilian started adapting these open-architecture, virtual-reality
network protocols that the military just developed. The cable TV industry,
say. Or telephone companies running Distributed Simulation on
fiber-to-the-curb. Or maybe some far-sighted commercial
computer-networking service. It's what the military likes to call the
"purple dragon" angle. Distributed Simulation technology doesn't have to
stop at tanks and aircraft, you see. Why not simulate something swell and
nifty for civilian Joe and Jane Sixpack and the kids? Why not purple
dragons?

We're talking serious bucks here. It's not the most serious money in a
superpower's massive military budget, granted - at least not yet, it isn't
- but it's very damned serious money by the standards of your average
Silicon Valley multimedia start-up. The defense simulation market is about
$2.5 billion a year. That's Hollywood-serious and then some. Over the next
10 years the Pentagon plans to drop about $370 billion on electronics R&D.
Some of that money will fall to simulation. Maybe a lot of it, if the
field really takes off.

There are some very heavy operators in the simulation market - and they
were all at the 14th I/ITSEC in San Antonio, Texas last November.

The gig was sponsored by the National Security Industrial Association - a
group that basically is the military-industrial complex. I/ITSEC was
graced by the corporate presence of General Electric, General Dynamics,
McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell, Hughes, Martin Marietta, and Bolt Beranek &
Newman. And yes, they were also favored by IBM, Lockheed, Motorola,
Silicon Graphics, Loral, Grumman, and Evans & Sutherland. And plenty more:
a whole cloud of hangers-on, suppliers, dealers, niche marketeers, and
brand-new startups.

All these nice-suited people were in handsome display booths in a very
large carpeted hall within hollering distance of the Alamo. The place was
alive with screens, top-heavy with humming megabytage. General Dynamics
ran their new tank simulator live, right on the display floor. Bolt
Beranek & Newman ran a hot new image generator that made mid-1980s SIMNET
graphics look like Hanna-Barbera.

They were running demos at every side, and handing out promotional videos,
and glossy display brochures, and every species of carnivorous
mega-corporate public relations. They boasted of clinching major sales in
foreign markets, and of their glowing write-ups in specialized industry
journals such as Military Simulation & Training ($73/year, Britain) and
Defense Electronics ($39/year, Englewood, Colo.) and National Defense
(American Defense Preparedness Assn., $35/year, Arlington, Va.). Strange
magazines, these. Very strange.

The attendees attended the keynote speeches, and the banquet speeches, and
the luncheon speeches. And they attended the presentations, and the paper
sessions, and the six tracks of formal programming. And they industriously
leafed through their blockbuster, 950-page I/ITSEC #14 Proceedings. This
enormous red-and-white volume, officially "approved for public release" by
the Department of Defense, was crammed-to-bursting with scholarly articles
such as "Computer-Supported Embedded Training Systems for the
Strike/Fighter Aircraft of Tomorrow," and "Hypermedia: a Solution for
Selected Training and Prototyping Applications."

And even "Virtual Training Devices: Illusion or Reality?" Not much debate
there. Simulators are, of course, both illusion and reality. They're not
entirely real, but they function just fine. And they pay like gangbusters.

These people weren't there for their health. They were there for a simple,
basic reason. Call it cyberpork. Cyberpork put the slash in
"Interservice/Industry." It put that handy hyphen into
"military-industrial." Industry wasn't lonely at I/ITSEC. Their patrons
were there in spades. Military brass - heavy brass, shiny brass. TRADOC,
the Training and Doctrine Command. STRICOM, the Simulation Training and
Instrumentation Command. Air Force Training Command. Naval Training
Systems Center. Naval Air Systems Command. People in crisp uniforms and
polished shoes, from weapons divisions, and materiel commands, and program
offices, and from forts and bases and academies and institutes, all across
the US.

Suppose that you were an ambitious and visionary leader of the post-Cold
War '90s military establishment, like, say, Col. Jack Thorpe. Or perhaps
Col. Ed Fitzsimmons of the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office, or Lt.
Col. James Shiflett from the Information Science and Technology Office, or
Col. William Hubbard from Army Battle Labs. What are you supposed to do
with all these people at I/ITSEC? On the face of it, your situation
doesn't look all that promising. The 40-year Cold War military-industrial
gravy train has clearly gone off the rails. There's gonna be - there's
bound to be - some "downsizing" and "restructuring" and "conversion" and
"transition," and all those other euphemisms for extreme and wrenching
economic pain to your own suppliers, and your own people, and your own
colleagues. Not to mention the potential threat to your own career.

Your answer, of course - you being the kind of guy you are - is to seize
this magnificent opportunity. Wire everyone up! Global, real-time,
broadband, networked vendors and suppliers! They're hurting now. They're
worried. They'll go for anything that looks like survival, that looks like
a hot new market. Seize the day. No more of this time-wasting,
money-squandering, inter-vendor rivalry with their incompatible standards.
One standard now. The Distributed Simulation Internet Standard.

The Distributed Simulation Internet doesn't even exist yet. It may never
exist. That's not a problem. What it does have is its own protocol. The
DSI Protocol will link simulation machines from manufacturers across the
field and across the planet.

This virtuality standard emerged from Orlando, Fla., in the early '90s,
from the potent nexus of Orlando's Institute for Simulation & Training,
Orlando's University of Central Florida, Orlando's US Army STRICOM,
Orlando's Naval Training Systems Center, and the Orlando-based, 400-strong
Standards for the Interoperability of Defense Simulations working groups.
(One mustn't rule out the possible cultural influence of Disneyworld,
either.)

They demo'd the new standard on a network link-up at I/ITSEC #14, live.
They went for the opportunity. They had to rip up some of the Ethernet
wiring that they'd laid before the show, because it had so many
crimp-failures from the tramping legions of wingtip-shod vendor feet. It
got hairy for a while there. But they got the demo to run.

Of course a system crashed. Somebody's system always crashes at any
multimedia demo. It's like a force of nature. In the case of the DIS
Interoperability Demo, it was the Mac Quadra 900 running the slide show.
The sucker iced when its screensaver kicked in, and the sweaty-palmed
techies from IDA had to re-boot live. They winged it, and got the slides
up. It looked okay. Most people didn't notice.

The protocol worked just fine. They had a big digitized section of the
terrain from Fort Hunter-Liggett in California, running live on-screen,
cunningly combined with an actual long-distance link to an actual wired
tank in actual Fort Hunter-Liggett.

"Seamless simulation," live onstage.

The demo was far from real virtual war. There was some ritual gunfire here
or there, but this wasn't real combat training. This was a fashion show in
seam-free camouflage haute-couture.

Everybody took a formal runway-model turn, up on the big virtual stage.
With live narration at the mike: "The bogeys are generated by Bolt Beranek
& Newman." General Dynamics Land Systems Division modeled the virtual M1A2
Battle Tank. From their own show-booth, General Electric thoughtfully
supplied an Abrams tank and an F-16. Hughes proudly displayed a robot
spy-drone. McDonnell Douglas had a surface-to-air missile, and Lockheed
demo'd a virtual Patriot battery. Twenty-four companies - twenty-five, if
you count the guys who supplied the video projectors. All of them packed
snugly in the DARPA virtual corral.

They had the brass lined-up right at the front, in a row of folding
chairs. A rear admiral here, a couple of lieutenant generals there; a full
brace of Cold War veterans, braid and chest ribbons and hats. The brass
watched the three monster screens with squint-eyed, show-me skepticism.

And the brass weren't blown-away, either. The network looked pretty good,
and it ran without crashing, but they weren't stunned or amazed. The brass
didn't leave San Antonio raving that they'd just seen the future and it
worked. They clearly didn't know quite what to make of what they had just
seen. One got the impression that they figured this virtual-network stuff
might turn into something useful someday. Cute gimmick. Clever. Worth a
look, I guess. Learn something new every day. Glad we came down here to
I/ITSEC. Lemme know when we can use this to invade Normandy.

The brass were on public exhibit themselves, actually. Whether they knew
it or not, they were legitimizers, stalking horses, Trojan Horses.
Generals and admirals from a very long-lasting but swiftly vanished era.
Compared to their tech-crazed subordinates - the Southwest Asian,
baby-boomer, carnivorous cyber-colonels, majors, and captains who are now
actually running the digitized New World Order American military - the
Cold War guys looked like a line of stuffed ducks.



Today Kuwait, Tommorow the World

There was some interesting stuff backstage at I/ITSEC. There was a big
rope-handled canvas bag full of the tools of the virtual trade: hex
crimpers, nut drivers, metric wrenches, soldering wire, cable strippers.
There were big ugly powerful rock'n'roll amps stenciled PROPERTY OF US
GOVT INSTITUTE FOR DEFENSE ANALYSES, and big color display monitors
shimmed up on cardboard, and there were powerstrips and orange extension
cords and some loose Mac floppies. And there was a handscrawled brag on a
backstage chalkboard, written by the techies from Orlando: "DIS
Interoperability Demonstration. Today's feature: DIS. Tomorrow: the
holodeck!"

The natural question arises: Is this some kind of wacky egghead DARPA
media hype, or is this a genuine military technology? Can governments
really exercise national military power - kick ass, kill people - merely
by using some big amps and some color monitors and some keyboards, and a
bunch of other namby-pamby sci-fi "holodeck" stuff?

The answer is yes.

Yes, this technology is lethal. Yes, it is a real strategic asset.
Military virtual reality is not a toy or a joke. There is a lot of
vaporware in "virtual reality," but this technology definitely will help
people kill each other. Virtual reality happens to be very fashionable at
the moment, with some ritzy pop-cultural overtones, but that is
accidental. Whether or not VR becomes a major new medium of commercial
entertainment, or some vital new mode of artistic expression, it still
will be of enormous use to the military. Thriving civilian VR will
probably make military VR expand even faster; giving the virtual
battlefield better and glossier set designs.

There was a demo at I/ITSEC called "Project 2851." This is a new standard
for digital terrains, a standard for all American armed forces. It will
let them share terrain databases on any number of different machines.

But there is another aspect to Project 2851. Project 2851 is about the
virtual reproduction and archiving of the entire planet. Simulator
technology has reached a point today in which satellite photographs can be
transformed automatically into 3-D virtual landscapes. These landscapes
can be stored in databases, then used as highly accurate training grounds
for tanks, aircraft, helicopters, SEALS, Delta Force commandos.

What does this mean? It means that soon there will be no such thing as
"unknown territory" for the United States military. In the future - soon,
very soon - the United States military will know the entire planet just
like the back of its hand. It will know other countries better than those
countries know themselves.

During the Battle of 73 Easting, an American tank regiment came roaring
out of an Iraqi desert that the Iraqis themselves could not navigate. The
Iraqis couldn't enter their own desert, because they would have died
there. But the Americans had satellite navigation units, so the Americans
knew where they were on our planet's surface right down to the yard.

The Stealth pilots who blew downtown Baghdad into hell-and-gone had
already flown those urban landscapes before they ever put their butts in
the cockpit seat. They knew every ridge, every skyline, every road -
they'd already seen them on console screens.

During Desert Storm, some Iraqi soldiers actually surrendered to unmanned
flying drones. These aircraft are disembodied eyes, disembodied screens,
network peripherals basically, with a man behind them somewhere many miles
away. And that man has another screen in front of him, and a keyboard at
hand, and a wire from that keyboard that can snake through a network and
open a Vent of Hell.

This is what it all means. Say you are in an army attempting to resist the
United States. You have big tanks around you, and ferocious artillery, and
a gun in your hands. And you are on the march.

Then high-explosive metal begins to rain upon you from a clear sky.
Everything around you that emits heat, everything around you with an
engine in it, begins to spontaneously and violently explode. You do not
see the eyes that see you. You cannot know where the explosives are coming
from: sky-colored Stealths invisible to radar, offshore naval batteries
miles away, whip-fast and whip-smart subsonic cruise missiles, or
rapid-fire rocket batteries on low-flying attack helicopters just below
your horizon. It doesn't matter which of these weapons is destroying your
army - you don't know, and you won't be told, either. You will just watch
your army explode.

Eventually, it will dawn on you that the only reason you, yourself, are
still alive, still standing there unpierced and unlacerated, is because
you are being deliberately spared. That is when you will decide to
surrender. And you will surrender. After you give up, you might come
within actual physical sight of an American soldier.

Eventually you will be allowed to go home. To your home town. Where the
ligaments of your nation's infrastructure have been severed with terrible
precision. You will have no bridges, no telephones, no power plants, no
street lights, no traffic lights, no working runways, no computer
networks, and no defense ministry, of course. You have aroused the wrath
of the United States. You will be taking ferries in the dark for a long
time.

This is not the future that I'm describing. Basically, this is the present
- this is what actually happened to the world's fourth largest army, in
Southwest Asia. Will the US Government continue to expand the course that
led us in that direction? After all, we've won the Cold War and our
domestic economy's hurting rather badly. Will the new Clinton
Administration follow the DARPA lead? Continue pouring money into the
gold-plated rathole of ultra-high-tech military-technological advance?

You might judge the likelihood of that by Bill Clinton's statements on the
campaign trail. "While we will need a smaller military in the post-Cold
War world, we must retain our superior technology, high-quality personnel,
and strong industrial base." That's what he told National Defense
magazine, anyhow.

Clinton and Gore may have little reason for fondness for the Army that
brought us Vietnam, but they've got plenty in common with their
generational contemporaries, the cybercolonels. They are calling for a
"civilian DARPA," but you can bet good money that they won't lose their
fondness for the military one. Defense Simulation Internet? The White
House is now in the hands of rabid fiber-optic enthusiasts.

The virtual iron is hot. Want to see a real vision of the virtual future?
It's a future in which large sections of the American military-industrial
complex have migrated entirely into cyberspace. This is the real DARPA
Virtual Reality Vision Thing, the plans they allude to with quiet
determination just after the big multimedia displays. "Simulate before you
build." They want to make that a basic military principle.

Not just simulated weapons. Entire simulated defense plants. Factories
that exist only in digital form, designed and prepared to build weapons
that don't even exist yet either, and have never existed, and may become
obsolete and be replaced by better ones, before a nail is ever hammered.
Nevertheless, these nonexistent weapons will have entire battalions of
real people who are expert in their use, people who helped design them and
improve them hands-on, in the fields of virtual war.

"Simulate before you build" is a daring ax-stroke at the very tap-root of
the Cold War-era military-industrial complex. It is a potential coup that
could deliver the whole multi-billion-dollar shebang - lock, stock, and
barrel - into the hands of the virtuality elite. If it shrinks the
military by 50 percent or so, so what? Instead of the 1 percent or so of
the Pentagon budget that they currently control, the simulation
cybercolonels will own everything, the whole untidy, hopelessly
bureaucratic, crying-for-improvement mess. No military object will see
physical existence until it is proven, under their own institutional
aegis, on the battlefields of cyberspace. They'll be able to shove the
ungainly Cold War camel through the cold glass eye of the cyberspace
needle. And God only knows what kind of sleek, morphing beast will emerge
from the other side.

Does this sound farfetched? Why? If something as delicate and precise as
virtual surgery is possible (and it is), then why not virtual military
manufacturing? Sure might solve a lot of pollution problems. And military
storage problems. All kinds of problems, when you come to think about it.

Let's have a speculative look at the 21st-century USA. Amber waves of
grain and all that. Peaceful place; scarcely resembles a military
superpower at all. Hardly any missile silos, hardly any tanks, hardly any
concertina wire. Until the Americans need it. Then the whole massive,
lethal superpower infrastructure comes unfolding out of 21st-century
cyberspace like some impossible fluid origami trick. The Reserve guys from
the bowling leagues suddenly reveal themselves to be digitally assisted
Top Gun veterans from a hundred weekend cyberspace campaigns. And they go
to some godforsaken place that doesn't possess Virtual Reality As A
Strategic Asset, and they bracket that army in their rangefinder screens,
and then they cut it off, and then they kill it. Blood and burning flesh
splashes the far side of the glass. But it can't get through the screen.

Maybe you can believe that idea and all that it implies - "simulate before
you build." Or maybe you might wax a little more cynical. Maybe what we're
presented here, under the slick rhetoric of the Paperless Office, is yet
another staggering stack of old-fashioned Pentagon paperwork - a brand new
way to make megabuck hammers and toilet seats to an entire new set of
ridiculous, endless bureaucratic specs. Only this time, after all the
studies and form-filling, you end up with absolutely no tangible product
at all!

Maybe it's just a bizarre Silicon Valley power-play. Every other major
American industry has got a sucker deep in the military-industrial juice.
Maybe it's time for the virtual reality, CAD-CAM, multimedia crowd to
hunker down with the older industries and have some long, life-giving sips
from the taxpayer's bloodstream. Maybe the whole scheme is just updated
hype - for that same old fat-cat, imperialistic, hypertrophied, overfed,
gold-plated military bureaucracy... .

Could be. It could go either way, maybe both ways at once - make your own
decision. One thing's for sure though. The US military today is the most
potent and lethal gold-plated military bureaucracy of all time.

You can't fault DARPA for lack of vision. Vision they've definitely got.
There's one matter, though, which they don't discuss much. That's the
possibility of a virtuality arms race.

If military virtuality really works, everyone's gonna want it.

Now imagine two armies, two strategically assisted, cyberspace-trained,
post-industrial, panoptic ninja armies, going head-to-head. What on earth
would that look like? A "conventional" war, a "non-nuclear" war, but a
true War in the Age of Intelligent Machines, analyzed by nanoseconds to
the last square micron.

Who would survive? And what would be left of them?
