                         SOUNDTRACKER MODULES
                         ====================

If you never heard a soundtracker tune before then you don't know
what you are missing!  The music styles range from rave to rock with
plenty of interesting samples thrown in.  All the disks listed are
high density and most contain module players.  I can only list the
name of the modules that are on the disk in such a short space, but
if you wish to request more information about a particular disk then
just write to me enclosing a first class stamp and I will do my best.

The best of the modules are on the latest disks, where possible I
include the full module name, failing that the title of the file.
