           Sound Files and Programs for the Atari Falcon030
           ================================================

Remember to quote the disk REFerence when ordering disks from the PDL.

Ref: 011
This disk contains the superb program CRAZY SOUNDS which does a job
very similar to SAM (Systems Audio Manager) but I think its better. 
There are 51 samples provided (in HSN format), a convertor program,
the Crazysound program and a mini accessory version.  You should have
endless fun with this one assigning things like Bart Simpson saying
'Hi Man' when you boot-up!  DIGITAPE is a fully working demo of this
top flight direct-to-disk recording package from Trade-It.  It's big,
its detailed, there are lots of options, you are restricted to 20
seconds maximum recording time (plenty!) and there are other things
missing like the mixer saving and track copying.  A VGA monitor is
highly recommended but it will run on an RGB in interlace mode.  Also
on this disk is FADER which comes from Normen Kowalewski, a TOS
developer from Atari Germany.  It seems to achieve the same job as
Audio Fun Machine does with various options for playback quality,
etc.  Whats more is that the complete C source code is included. 
FORTUNE is a program to play and create sound cites on your Atari
Falcon like on big UNIX computers (taken straight from the doc file).
 Ok this is a similar sort of program to SAM and Crazy Sounds but its
public domain, uses the Unix system (which means many cites are
already available).  A sample CITE (a cite is a collection of samples
and text data) is included called FLAVOR and I have seen other PDL's
offering cites for purchase so if you find this useful you may like
to check them out, I think Star Trek are the most popular ones
though!  This program is recommended for VGA monitors but will work
with RGB in interlace.  There are two soundtracker modules players on
this disk and they are the PROPLAY.ACC from Cylab of TPN which lets
you listen to Protracker Amiga modules while doing other things. 
There is also the ProTracker v2.1a replayer by Griff of Electronic
Images which plays the modules at 50khz with 32 bit interpolation
which gives a much different kind of sound to the music, it also
decrunches Powerpacked modules from the Amiga!  Finally there are two
pieces of assembler source code for replaying modules.  The last
program on this very packed disk is XBAR.  Now all the docs are in
German and I must confess to being unable to understand a word of
them, but when you boot up Xbar is presents you with a screen that
lets you have DAC, DSP, DMA and EXT down the side and ADC, DSP, DMA
and EXT along the top and at a guess I think you can vary the source
of the sound and the way in which you want to replay it.  Its all
very confussing but the full C source code is here along with some
DSP effect modules and an ACC version.

Ref: 033
This disk includes files to be found in the UTILS section of this PD
catalogue, but it also has the following sound and music related
packages.  AUDIO CD PLAYER will do just that!  Take a music source
from your CD-ROM and play it through your speakers so you can listen
to your favourite compact discs through your Falcon.  AUDIO 12
appears to be a _very_ basic sampling program written by Martin
Sieper.  You can sample direct to memory or disk in either 8 bit
mono, 8 bit stereo or 16 bit stereo at one of 8 different frequencies
(from 8195 Hz to 49170 Hz).  You can also control the volume of the
input and output.  Nice but basic.  DMA-SOUND is a sound sample
player devloped for the STE, TT and Falcon computers.  Bascially it
allows you to play samples using the in-build hardware of the Falcon,
it seems to work well but doesn't have many frequencies so you may
find it limited.  Finally music related on this disk is HARDCHOR, no
its not the unfinished Jeff Minter game, but another direct to disk
recording package for the Falcon.  It seems to have come from TOS
Magazin, well whatever its all very German but nothing you shouldn't
be able to understand.  Three sample rates, three formats, set the
size of the sample, record to disk, playback from disk and 5 DSP
effects including Delay, Equalizer, Harmoniser, Flanger and Karaoke. 
Infact this seems to be a very early version of Compos Musicom, still
its PD, its free and it works.  This disk also contains Connect,
Colour Icons, CS and Chagall demo.

Ref: 055
Not essentially a sound related disk it does contain some interesting
programs (see the UTILS section for more details).  DIGITAL TRACKER
1.03 was the first tracker (and indeed still the only as far as I
know) to play more than the standard 4 channel Amiga modules. 
Digital can handle up to 8 channels in this version.  An ACCessory
version and two modules are provided.  DOC files are far and few
between so its a case of trial and error, and if you have never used
a module maker before, probably error.  TCB TRACKER is that age old
ST module maker converted to run on the Falcon, I don't know why you
could want to use it but should you have some old TCB modules (they
never did use the conventional format) then I guess this might be
useful to rip sounds from.  SPEKTRUM is a graphical spectrum analyser
on-screen, thats all it does!

Ref: 071
WAVEFORM FILES DISK 1.  Hit the beach, the surfs up as these cool
WAVe's roll into the short.  If you do not know what a WAVe file is
let me explain.. they originate from the PC Windows environment and
are basically sampled sounds much like the AVR or SAM ones we are
more used to hearing on the Atari.  You can use the WAV player like
the one that comes with Crazy Sounds (Ref: 011) or the 5-2-5
convertor program.  Whatever a player is not provided (no room) so
you will have to seek one out from somewhere.  The WAV's on this disk
include a lot of classic Blackadder quotes, the files are: BARKER,
CANIHELP, CHERRI, CORKIT, CRACKER, CRAP, DUCK, FATGIT, HUMBUG, JAMN,
OHDEAR, OMNIBUS, OOPS, PIGGY, PUDDINGS, RHINO, SPLAN, SQUEEK,
TANGRNE, THINGIT, TIDDLER and VISITN.  They are extremely funny!

Ref: 072
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 2.  Yet more, this time the theme is very
American TV humour (ie, not very funny!).  Files are: ANMALDRV,
BAMBI, BEATIFUL, DNGWOMAN, ERRECT, HIHOTIM, LESSTHAN, MACHO, NEEDMAN,
NOBEER, NOCONTRL, NOTCLOSE, SAUSAGE, SHAKBEER, VAVAVOOM and VISURGE.

Ref: 073
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 3.  Not many samples here because they are big
files and are mainly Japanese singing and music!  Hey, I am sure you
can find a use for theses somewhere!!!  Files are: 106MILES,
94DOLLAR, AHANHGAI, BESTPAL, GHOST, MISSION and WORST.  (Actually
GHOST is a really nice tune I wish I could have heard more).

Ref: 074
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 4.  25 samples on here from the Simpsons to
women talking to computery clicks and noises.  Files are: ASKDOCTR,
BART, BUM, COW, DEAD_OR, FORGET, HAPPYJOY, HAVEYOU, ICANHARD,
IDONTLIK, ITSBEEN, JOY, LOCTUS, LOG, LOGTUNE, MEGAMIX1, MEMORIES,
NOSIR, NUKEUM, ONLYADRE, ROBOCOP, TALKING, TELLME, WELCOME and
YOUWORM.  (Megamix1 is a complete compilation of most the samples on
this disk into one brain blasting 343K sample that sounds really very
good!).

Ref: 075
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 5.  Lots of little samples on here, 34 in total.
 Plenty of effects, voices and snippets to enhance that desktop!

PHOTON, POP, R2BEEP, ROBBY, ROBOCOP, SORT, STTNG, WHOP, WOWO, YERDEAD
and YES_MAST.  (This disk is ideal for SAM or CITE files).

Ref: 076
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 6.  Another alsortment of wierd and wonderful
WAV's.  27 samples mainly sound effects this time.  Files are:
CLAPPING, DIVEHORN, DOORBELL, DRUM1, HORN1, MPYTHON, MUSIC, MUSICA,
OLDCLOCK, PENAL, PERMIS, PHONE2, PHONRING, PITFOR, POWERL, PROTOPLM,
PROVERB, PURPOS, SHIPHORN, SHORT, SPAM, SPEED, SW1USEF, WHALES,
WHISTLE, YIPE and ZIP.

Ref: 077
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 7.  I am not sure about the legalities of these
samples as they are mainly taken from Street Fighter 2 and other SNES
games, still until someone complains they can't do much harm I hope. 
Files are: BLANKA, END, HADOKEN, HORYUKEN, KNIFE, LIGHT, MF-THINK,
MIND, MYMYDY, NOPROB, OH, OHJOY, SONICBM, STARFOX, START, TGRUPCUT,
YADA, YOGAFIRE and YOGAFLM.  (If you are thinking of making a beat em
up game then this is a disk to get!).

Ref: 078
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 8.  My last disk of WAV's for now and I leave
you with no less than 49 samples on this disk.  Everything from Star
Trek to sound effects to cartoon snippets.  A great collection.  The
files are: 10000MAR, 1CARTOON, 20SECOND, AHHHHH, ALIENLF, BOING,
BRIDGE4, BRIDGE5, BRIDGE6, BRIDGE7, BUMMER, BUMTOO, CHICKEN, CHILL1,
CHILL2, CHIMES, CHORD, CLARIC, CORRECT1, CORRECT2, DICKWAD, DING,
DROOPY, DRUM, ERROR, FLAGUP, GDDY2DIE, GOODMO, GOODMO1, GRAVIT, HAND,
HARDER, HIHAL, HIMAN, HITME, ISWEAR, JUMP, KLAXON1, KLAXON2,
LOOPME01, LOOPME02, MEEPMEEP, NOWHERES, NYUKNYUK, PLAYME01, POP,
THANKYOU, VAULT and WELCOME.  (A great collection if ever there was
one!).

Ref: 085
As well as an EKO demo, Graph Prg and a picture this disk also
contains: DIGITAL 2.02 this is the newest version of the 4,6 and 8
channel soundtracker player and composer.  It is getting better all
the time and you really should register this version if you intend
using it for making your own tunes.  It will play the PC formats and
is expanding all the time.

Ref: 101
Along with the new version of the hit-game Lasers and Men this disk
contains the TriMod creator which will allow you to make chip music
on your Falcon for playback on the ST or Falcon (run in ST LOW).  I
have also included the superb MegaTizer Music Collection and the ZAK
player so you can listen to all those wonderful old ST chip tunes all
over again, and some of them really are quite good even today.  Could
be useful for someone wanting some music but for a small size
program.

Ref: 127
OCTALYSER 0.90 is a new Falcon enhanced 8 channel soundtracker module maker
and player.  It works fine under NVDI on RGB or VGA and with 1 meg or more.
You can load, play, save and edit your own modules but to be able to load in
AVR samples you'll need to register with the authours.  This is a very nice
program to use and the 8 channels are fun to play with.  Although only an
8-bit tracker at heart its still a very good and easy to use program.  Full
doc files and a tutorial and sample modules are provided in the package.

Ref: 128
MJUZAKK is a sample sequencer that will let you string together DVS or AVR
samples and make wonderful music over four channels.  I guess you are only
limited by the memory you have in your system.  This is a German program
but most of you should be able to figure this one out within a few minutes.
There is a (large) example file provided which does a good job of showing
what can be achieved, the shareware message pops up all over the place so if
you are thinking of using this program a lot then you know what to do.
Mjuzakk is a ZIP file and the complete ST ZIP 2.4 (Falcon Fixed version) is
supplied on the disk.  It takes up about 1.7 meg of your hard drive and is
fine with RGB or VGA but needs Interlace mode, 16 colour.
