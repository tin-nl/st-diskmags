ATARI ENTERTAINMENT

This A4 sized, colour, glossy magazine claims it is the world first
dedicated Atari Lynx and Jaguar magazine, well who are we to argue?
To be honest I was impressed right from the start, this is an
amauteur publication put together by three guys who have done a
superb job indeed.  The layout is nice and clean, the screen shots
are very good and the quality of writing is on par with the
commercial offerings but still retains a nice personal touch.  There
are large colour adverts, a superb selection of full colour pictures
from Aliens Vs Predator, they are THE best I have seen published in
any magazine.

Contents include a feature of the Jaguar in the States, detailed
reviews of Malibu Bikini Volleyball, Desert Strike, Cybermorph,
European Soccer Challenge, Battlewheels and Crescent Galaxy.  A very
good overview of the Jaguar and its hardware.  Complete codes for the
Lynx version of Lemmings, a superb round-up of just about every Lynx
game ever released, a gossip column, readers adverts and a
subscription form to top it all off.

At only œ1.20p an issue this is a must buy if you have a Jaguar or
Lynx or are just interested in what's developing in these sectors.

Atari Entertainment is the natural progression from the previously
published fanzine - Lynx User.  They have over two years of Atari
console publication expertise behind them and are well qualified for
this sort of magazine.  Back issues of Lynx User are available for a
bargain price.
