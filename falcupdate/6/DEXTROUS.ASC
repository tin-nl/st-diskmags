
                DEXtrous Cyber-Iconic File Management
                         by Titan Design Ltd

Another stunning product from the legendary Black Scorpion Software
Group who just keep on producing the best code available for Ataris.

OVERVIEW
Although strictly speaking not a replacement Desktop, the user has
the choice between the standard GEM Desktop or DEXtrous which, being
an ACCessory, is available at any time.  Every single function of the
Desktop is provided in DEXtrous, but has the advantage of an instant
access File Manager.  DEXtrous provides incredible speed with
independant resolutions and custom windowing for superb control.

CYBERSPACE BROWSER
DEXtrous allows the user to view files as a large recursive
cyberspace, where the files are visualised 'inside' directories, and
the user can 'move' into directories and look around.

ICONIC ORGANISER
This feature provides the user with a means to organise files into
'logical' directories much like the Windows Program Manager.  It
includes the ability to generate icons from any art package as thumb
nails from image files!

FILE VIEWER
This is accessed when any file is selected - with a display of that
file in its native format, whether graphics (including GIF, TGA, TIF)
or text.  Files not supported viewed as ASCII or HEX, however,
Calamus CFN, GEM font formats and even some music and animation
modules can be viewed or played.

DEXtrous - TOTAL FILE CONTROL and a snip at only 25.50 + VAT
