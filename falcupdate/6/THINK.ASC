Thought!
Ideas Processor v2.0

A New Concept
-------------
Thought! is an entirely new concept and an absolutely essential
development tool for anyone who develops anything on an Atari
computer!  The flexibility of Thought! allows it to be uesd for
programming, diaries and address books or even a filing system.

Thought! allows for structured development of work to be performed
with ease, but with one unique feature that permits programs to be
launched from the Thought! shell which can be linked to an associated
file, supporting parameter passing if necessary.

Editing
-------
Any symbol or group of symbols can easily be edited with full cut,
copy, move functions available to the user.  Symbols can also be
redesignated to totally different functions by using the REDO
feature.

Idea Creation
-------------
Structures are created with each Symbol defining a different routine
of the project with full textual descriptions contained within. 
Compilers, Linkers, Assemblers, Word processors, DTP, CAD,
Spreadsheets, Databases - in fact virtually any software can then be
linked to a customised structure.

Output
------
Structures can be printed to a variety of devices or output to a disk
as a file which is configured to compose the entire textual content.

Total Support
-------------
Attention to detail is a hallmark of the Thought! program.  Details
such as movable Fly Dials, compatibility with MultiTOS, Speedo GDOS,
NVDI, Reflex Card and full colour support are just some of the superb
features available.
