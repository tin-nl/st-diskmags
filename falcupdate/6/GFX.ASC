Ref: 012
PERSISTANCE OF VISION RAYTRACER.  It's big, it's bad and its going to
need a lot of hard disk space, patience and pure skill to get
anything even remotely nice looking from it.  But patience is a
virtue they say.  The whole package is ZIPped up to the hilt, there
is no unZIP program supplied (no room) and with 390K worth of doc
files to wade your way through can I wish you the best of luck and if
you do create any nice pictures then please send them to me so I can
boggle over them and wish I was as talented.  HD required.

BITCAMRA is a Falcon Image Utility from SKWare One, it will enlarge,
reduce and reproportion mono, 4 colour, 16 colour, 256 colour and
true colour images very fast with good results.  Loads IMG, STTT IMG,
XIMG and XGA pictures.  Save is disabled!  So can only really be used
as a picture viewer unless you register with them.  DML APPLICATIONS
these include AUTOGIF, AUTOIFF, AUTORAW and AUTOTGA.  Simply drag the
picture onto the program or set it up as an APPlication and it will
display the picture of your choice.  IFF2XIMG convertor program.  IFF
HAM 8 picture viewer.  JPEG4A will convert from JPEG to GIF or from
GIF to JPEG, can accept command line input to do a whole series of
files in one go, very useful program.  PALETTE MASTER is a simple
palette checking program designed for the Crazy Dots expansion card
but works just as well on the Falcon.  SPEED OF LIGHT GIF Viewer 2.1
and 2.5 provided here, uses clever dithering processs to give the
effect of more colours than are actually on-screen.  GEMVIEW 2.24 the
best shareware image viewing package, plenty of features, register it
now (updated version elsewhere in this catalogue).  STUDIO PHOTO DEMO
load and play with all the picture types including Photo CD, TIFF,
GIF, JPEG and more, but sadly no save option.

Ref: 022
BABY SE FALCON 030 is an image loading, manipulation package that has
many of the features of Studio Photo, infact from decidely similar
French menu options I would say this is a very early version of
Studio Photo under a different name and with the save function
intact!  GEMVIEW 2.30 the best gets better, it now runs in True
Colour mode 100%, it comes with its own install program and a hard
drive is recommended.  PAPILLON 1.0 by Stefan Becker and Dirk
Sabiwalsky is a very detailed art package with a wide range of tools
and other effects options.  Allows exportation as IMG, Doodle, STAD,
MacPaint, IFF or PCX formats.  STUDIO PHOTO seems to make it onto
this disk as well for some reason, a sample JPEG is supplied and yes
the save function is still disabled!  TRUE PAINT is another demo of
an art package this time by HiSoft, again a sample JPEG is supplied
to play with.  A good try before you buy situation.

Ref: 083
Along with Multi Briques and Starball this disk also contains a demo
of Lexicors Phoenix 2 raytracing package.  Sadly you will need an FPU
in order to use even the demo so I can't comment on it, but from the
doc files I have read it looks very detailed indeed and should give
you all a great time if raytracing is your scene.

Ref: 092
GEMVIEW 3.00 the best is back and this time is has grown so much it
warrants a whole new upgrade!  There are external picture modules,
print modules, snapshot programs, configuration files, improved
colour reduction, faster conversion times, monochrome TIFF bug fix,
source code for new drivers included, zoom functions and much much
more.  This is the all time great of image viewing and conversion and
your collection shouldn't be without this program.

Ref: 122
DELM PAINT (or D2M) from PARX in France is a very nice looking paint package
indeed.  There are many features you'd expect to find in such a high quality
package as this, indeed this is alas only a demo version.  Plenty of picture
types are supported and it runs in all resolutions, dithering the pictures as
required.  There is a lot to do and a lot to play with, needless to say most
the options are in French.  Sample pictures are provided.

Ref: 129
PERSISTANCE OF VISION RAYTRACER version 2.00.  This is the new version of the
best free raytracing package there is.  Its deep, its complex, it has more
support files and example code and doc files than you could fit on one HD disk
and its got plenty of Atari bindings making it the only choice for anyone
who is considering attempting rendering on their Falcon.  The whole package
has been ZIPped into sections and it will need a massive amount of hard drive
space (around 4 meg I believe).  Be prepared for LONG stints with your Falcon
doing nothing while your latest masterpiece renders the electricity bill away
only to find you put the wrong image on the wrong face!  This is the complete
POV 2 system EXCEPT the POVSRC.ZIP (the source code files for the Unix, PC,
VMS, Amiga and Acorn computers - the Atari ones are on the disk).  If you
want these files too then just add 50p to the price of this disk and I'll
include them on a seperate disk for you.  I'll also put them on the next
graphics disk when I have something to go with it.
