THE FALCON OWNERS GROUP PD AND SHAREWARE LIBRARY

Thank you for obtaining this FOG PD catalogue.  We are sure you will find
software to make your Falcon's chips glow with excitement.  With our new
catalogue ordering couldn't be easier, just send us the list of the disk
reference numbers you want and the correct amount of money and stamps and
wait for them to arrive through your letter box within a week.

Where possible we have stated if you require a VGA or RGB monitor, 1 or 4
meg of memory and a floppy or hard disk.  If you are unsure then please
contact us with your question and we will do our best to test if the 
software is suitable for your system.  Sadly we can't test for other TOS
versions than 4.02 and 4.01, but as a safe bet the newer the TOS version
the better the chances of it working.

Some programs require, or make use of, Speedo GDOS and/or MultiTOS.  For
obvious reasons these are not supplied with the programs.  If you are 
missing any of your system software, or wish to receive the latest updates
then please see the SYSTEM.ASC file that came with this catalogue.

If you have any software not listed here then please get in touch for arrange
for a swap.

Well we all hope you find something of interest here hidden away amoung our
130+ disks of Falcon software.  The PD catalogue is updated on a daily basis
as and when new software arrives, if you have access to the Internet then why
not email us and get the new listings sent to you automatically ?  If you
have a modem then download the latest copy from the Chameleon BBS.  Else
send us a blank formatted disk and return postage for the latest update.  We
always include a very small selection of Falcon software with our catalogue
and this will change from month to month.

The latest and most current lists of PD are always published once a month in
our disk magazine - FALCON UPDATE.  Read the FOG_INFO.ASC file for more.

I hope to hear from you soon,

Kind regards,
