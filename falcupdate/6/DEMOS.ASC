                         DEMOS and ANIMATIONS
                         ====================

Ref: 010
3DTT demo originally designed for the Atari TT it is a fine showcase
of true fast vector graphics.  BIRDY is an animation from Brainstorm
of France featuring a 256 colour ray-traced birdy going for a walk
down the street!  TERMINAL F**K UP by Sanity, watch as your screen is
taken for a blast in this early but impressive demo.  PARAGON demo is
a simple but colourful affair featuing gouraud shaded vector objects
and you can add your own sample too.  Finally there is Griffs
Protracker replayer on this disk along with 3 JPEG format pictures
but no viewer.  This disk was rated 72% in ST Format magazine and
features some of the first ever Falcon demos.

Ref: 014
CEBIT 93 demo is a basic but nice demo with a good soundtrack.  Watch
as the stars and letters scroll around then the peeping hole shows
off a lovely lady underneath!  RGB only.  The BLACK SCORPION DEMOS
feature two versions of their clever PLASMA screens, the SPEEDER demo
which lets you fly this craft around a SNES mode-7 style landscape
and INTEL INBIN telling a colourful message!  RGB only.  Cebit is an
LZH file and BSS a ZIP file, UNLZH included.

Ref: 021
OMEGA GROTESQUE demo featuring a 'rave' soundtrack and lots of
dancing people and other clever effects.  RGB only.  The RED SECTOR
INTRO is from a cracked game and has a nice logo and module.  RGB
only.  The LEFT DONUGHT demo from Griff features a great interpolated
module, nice raytraced picture and clever gouraud shaded vectors. 
RGB only.  F UK MOI 1 and 2 some odd colour wizardry.  RGB only.

Ref: 025
HUMANS DEMO this is a multiple animation of the forthcoming game
Humans on the Falcon (or probably called Dino Dudes when released). 
There are some amusing little animations here all in nice 256
colours.  You will need a hard drive and 4 meg and its RGB only.

Ref: 026
HUMANS DEMO DISK TWO.  This _is_ needed for the above demo.  It has
been zipped up to save space and both parts are required.

Ref: 028
MORPHING ANIMATION this is a sample from the forthcoming Chroma
Studio 24 from Black Scorpion Software.  Watch as two faces morph
into each other!  Quite freaky really.  Morph patch included so now
works on VGA and RGB monitors.  BLAT a clever and wonderful little
game in the columns ilk, good sounds and addictive gameplay.

Ref: 029
NEW POWER GENERATION DENTRO this is a nice first attempt from the
680XX convention in Hamburg, featuring a brilliant vector dot star
tunnel and real time overscan fractals.  RGB only.  SHADE BOBS is
quite mesmerising really!  Colourful fun and with a nice soundtrack
to boot.  GFX displays a really superb true colour picture which
cannot be described but is of a fantasy origin.  RGB only.  WHEN
DREAMS BECOME REALITY is the final demo and features some excellent
graphics and effects including a cube rotated in real time with a
true colour picture on each face.  RGB only.

Ref: 030
RAYTRACED FUJI DEMO this is an amazing raytraced animation featuring
a spotlight rotating around and lighting up a Fuji logo amoungst
other things, this is a massive ZIP file and is RGB only.  For music
freaks there is the TUBULAR BELLS demo, no graphics, no text, just a
wonderful rendition of Mike Oldfields classic in 16-bit Stereo.

Ref: 044
LEMANS ANIMATION is another Brainstorm product and fills an entire
disk on its own, there is a nice (suitble!) looped sample and a mini
screen featuring cars crashing and smashing all over the place.

Ref: 045
STEALTH FLI ANIMATION.  This is another big animation, but this 256
colour PC port-over is really very special and features a stealth
fighter plane taking off, zooming around then landing again.  Very
clever indeed.  FLI player included.

Ref: 046
CRIME DEMO is a brilliant little demo from the DNT crew and has some
wicked effects including shade bobs, real time light-sourced vectors,
true colour fractals, bouncing jello balls, sinus dots and more.  RGB
only.  NETHACK ok so this isn't really a demo but its on this disk so
you will have to put up with it!  This is a more friendly version of
the age-old classic text based RPG game Hack.  You will need 2 meg at
least and run it in hi-res mode, best suited to a VGA monitor. 
VERTICAL MAYHEM is a brilliant columns clone written by Griff of
Electronic Images, rated 78% by ST Format.

Ref: 047
GEOTECH is a plasma landscape generator, you can't save them though. 
RGB only.  HANDS and MOUSE are two more amusing animations, hands
features an on-going morph as one shape blends into the next, mouse
shows a mouse getting the fright of its life, both backed with good
samples.  MOD CODE is the 68000 assembler source code required for
playing back a soundtracker module.

Ref: 051
PENTAGON is a nice RGB or VGA demo, it doesn't have some of the more
impressive effects of the newer demos but it still can strut its
stuff along with the rest of them.  Its soundtrack is a nice touch. 
WARUM demo by Lazer is superb with some nifty graphical trickery,
good graphics and good soundtrack.  RGB only.  MINI's are a
collection of little RGB only demos including shade bobs, true colour
sprites and rasters.

Ref: 052
GEM and WAX vector demos, a nice module and lots and lots of vector
graphics for you to move your way through, watch planes fly and odd
boxes rotate!  RGB only.  DSP FRACTAL creator will do just that! 
Make fractals using the brute force of the DSP chip.  INCONVEX is
another small 'tester' demo, RGB only.  MAGNET9 creates more colour
wobbling madness on your screen (RGB only) and finally MJJPROD is a
nice mix of a few little sections and some OK music but it crackles a
lot for my liking!  This is also RGB only.

Ref: 056
FRACTAL FLIGHT by Opium of France kicks up with a great looped sample
of 'What is Love' by Haddaway and then proceeds to fling you across
this fractal landscape much like some of the PC games do!  RGB only. 
COOL is a nice shade bob demo by EKO (my personal favourites) and is
RGB only (as expected).

Ref: 057
CHROME DRAGON is another giga-feast from Opium of France.  There are
many many effects in this one hidden deep in the demo and backed with
a wonderful soundtracker module.  Also on this disk is EKO's (yeah!)
technically top notch demo PAPA WAS A BLADERUNNER, featuring a
booming sample from the Orb's Fluffy Clouds the demo slides you into
all manner of clever and entrancing effects including some nifty
z-buffering (as seen in Cybermorph on the Jaguar!).  Impressive stuf.
 Both demos are RGB only.

Ref: 058
BIG DIGI DEMO has a few tracks from the BIG demo by TEX (The
Exceptions) from many years back on the ST and to be honest its crap!
EXTRO is a nice little intro featuring a busty cartoon warrior and
bouncing scroll text.  SHADE VECTORS is, well, exactly that!  Also
known as Tats Tiny True Colour Test!  CONFLICT is a very nice demo
from the Dead Hackers Society, good music and good effects, RGB only.
Finally is TEKNO DEATH a wild, stomping 'rave' demo with dancing
people, swimming fish and bouncing jelly cubes!!!  Manic!!!

Ref: 060
FLI ANIMATIONS 2.  BALL is a bouncing ball!  EARTH is the globe
spinning on its x-axis and PROBE is a nice raytraced space probe
zooming in then out of the screen.  All are 256 animations.

Ref: 061
FLI ANIMATIONS 3.  PORSHE is a very well looped animation of a porshe
in a car show being rotated around infront of you, amazing.  INVOKE
is a bizarre animation of a chrome lady willing this box to morph
into a ball and back again!  Odd but lovely.

Ref: 062
FLI ANIMATIONS 4.  PLAYROOM is a short trip into a virtual reality
fun centre!  Watch as the monitor screens blip into life and the room
rotates around, too short.  PENGUIN features a bizarre wobbling
penguin that stretches and contorts around the screen in a pecking
fashion.

Ref: 063
FLI ANIMATIONS 5.  SUPER NOVA.  Ok so you only get once animation on
this disk, and it has been packed with LZH (player and unlzh
provided) but - WOW - WHAT an animation it is!  Watch as an entire
planet goes super nova and sends shock waves rippling out into the
galaxy.

Ref: 064
FLI ANIMATIONS 6.  NEWTONS CRADLE.  Again this takes up a whole disk
but its a ray traced feast for anyones eye's as the time honured
newtons cradle bops back and forth, mirrored of course in the balls!

Ref: 065
FLI ANIMATIONS 7.  FISHY is a colourful underwater animation with
tropical fish and harpoons zooming around the place.  VOYAGER is
stunning, like the opening to a top sci-fi series on television or
something as a huge star cruiser zooms up the screen past you.

Ref: 066
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 1.  The Moving Pixels demo was constructed
for use with VGA monitors only and is really designed as a show room
show-off for the Falcon030.  As you might expect there are some very
impressive graphics and music and if that wasn't all the whole thing
talks to you constantly (the main reason for its large size).  You
will need a hard drive, VGA display and 4meg of memory.  Oh and don't
forget the other four disks too!  Yep, its that big AND it has been
ZIPped up.

Ref: 067
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 2 (required for above VGA demo).

Ref: 068
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 3 (as above).

Ref: 069
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 4 (as above).

Ref: 070
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 5 (as above).

Ref: 080
GULLE AM BACH is a little DSP testing demo from EKO featuring some
nice vector dot tricks and music.  RGB only.  Also on this disk is
part one of the mammoth LAZER demo called UNGTO.  This pure beast
will unpack and require 6 MEG of your hard drive and all 4 meg of
your memory (ie not ACC's or AUTO programs).  It is also RGB only.
So what do you get for such a massive demo?  The answer is
everything!  From the stunning morphing intro animation to the fake
Unix clone (Lanix!) it throws you throw 15 minutes of PURE demo with
not a scroll text in sight.  3D worlds are explored.  Sinus dots. 
Star Tunnels.  Stunning graphics and stunning music.  If you only
ever get one demo for your Falcon, make sure its this one!  You will
not be dissapointed.

Ref: 081
LAZER UNGTO DEMO DISK 2 (ZIPped file) you will need this to complete
the set of the totally amazing demo, this is truly the Falcon coming
of age and will blow ANY Amiga demo out of the water.

Ref: 082
MARGA DEMO.  Umm yes, well, this is an odd one indeed!  It's all in
German, ie I couldn't read anything, and has some very odd jazz
sounding music and a few hi-res scanned pictures of some women that
look like they are coming out of the 1940's.  Someone let me know
what this demo is all about please!

Ref: 086
PLASTIKK VIBRATION.  Following on from their plastic origins way back
on disk 029, the NEW POWER GENERATION are back with another brain
blasting demo-extravaganzaaaa!!!  and wow is this good!  It has
everything including a fly-your-own helicopter ride over a fractal
mountain terrain!  Very clever stuff indeed and well worth getting. 
Depacks to 3.5meg on your hard drive and needs an RGB display.  Also
on this disk is the ACP module player and a new FRACTAL CREATION
utility, so play away after being dazzled by NPG.

Ref: 087
STRANGE EXPECTATIONS from New Trend is one of my all time favourite
demos on the Falcon.  For a start it opens with a HUGE scrolling ray
traced picture, the music being very well linked into this, and then
proceeds into the demo proper and throws you away amoungst the
awesome star tunnels, graphics and technical effects.  The music is
top notch too.  RGB only and an LZH packed file (unlzh NOT included).

Ref: 091
FOG ANIMATION.  Yes we have our own animation at last and boy is this
one surreal!  Watch as Garfield jumps out of your monitor and starts
playing with the mouse, watch babies cry, Falcon's fly and disks zoom
by.  It's all very odd, very clever and very entertaining.  Only uses
16 colours but still fills a meg and a half of your hard disk, VGA
and RGB.  Many thanks to John for this masterpiece!

Ref: 093
CHAOS AD 2 DEMO by the DNT crew.  They too have improved since their
last Falcon offering and CHAOS proves this big style!  50 images per
second update, full real-time calculations, 50 Khz stereo soundtrack,
384x256 and 768x512 overscanned screens in 16256 or 65536 colours. 
About 10 minutes of total brain-crash.  FRIED BITZ GRAPHICS enteries
from the Fried Bitz demo party, lots of RGB only screens with some
amazing artwork, really amazing!  Chaos is RGB only.

Ref: 094
ARRIVAL DEMO by Passion.  This is a rather average demo that does try
to show you what can be done but never seems to make it fully, still
there are a lot of good effects hidden away in here and I for one
look forward to more from the Passion crew soon.  RGB only.  DEMENTIA
by Avena has some lovely effects and storming raytraced title
picture, there is not too much to this demo, but what there is really
counts and makes up for it.  More from Avena PLEASE!  Watch out EKO!!
RGB only (of course).

Ref: 100
JAGUAR DEMO by Pure Bollocks.  This is a large demo that shows you
various screen shots from forthcoming or released Jaguar games.  They
are only in 256 colours and you can tell they have lost something,
especially the Tiny Toon's pictures.  However this is a quite nice
slideshow and its interesting to see what Jaguar owners will be
getting, I for one thought the Aliens Vs. Predator screens were
amazing!  VGA (with distortion at the bottom of the screen but
nothing too bad) and RGB.  POSITIVITY DEMO is called 'Waiting the Zik
Disk' and is a very little dentro type thing, not so good by todays
standards, it looks very STE'ish.  VOXMAIL is a demo of a complete
voice mailing package for the Falcon, why buy an answer phone when
you can let Voxmail do it for you?  Great fun to be had here!

Ref: 116
MUGWUMPS CYCEDELIC KNOCKOUT DEMO.  This is something VERY special indeed,
right from the cheesy sci-fi animation intro and superb use of the Star
Trek samples to the final end screen with its wonderful 8 channel DSP 
replayed module.  This is a 'trance demo' almost like those 'rave' demos
that were very popular a while back (and indeed still are).  It uses nothing
but superb patterns and colour swirls to achieve its effect which is quite
awesome indeed.  There is an epilepsy warning at the start of this demo!!!
Use a big monitor or TV, pump the sound via your hi-fi stack and let your
eyeballs melt over this unique demo.  You won't have seen anything like it,
I can promise you that.  Required 4 meg memory minimum, hard drive and RGB
or VGA (but it must be able to do 50 hz).  The first part is on this disk,
the second is on Ref: 117.  Order and be well and truly amazed.

Ref: 117
MUGWUMPS CYCEDELIC KNOCKOUT DEMO - Disk Two - required!  Both disks are
ZIPped but unzip is provided along with instructions.

Ref: 119
INDEPENDANT MUSIC COMPILE 1.  The 1 in the title suggests there may be more
to come, well I certainly hope so if they are as good as this one.  There is
over an hours playing time worth of top quality soundtracker modules which
you select from a nice menu system.  The file takes up just over 1 meg on
your hard disk (or floppy!) needs 4 meg memory and works fine on an RGB or
VGA.  Lots of _good_ music to be found here.

Ref: 123
FLI ANIMATIONS 8.  They are all ZIPped and a player is provided.  There are
6 anims on this disk which are: BALLS (a nice raytraced thing) BIRDSHOW (a
funny dancing bird, very good quality) BIRDWALK (the famous walking bird!)
BOUNCE (lots of little balls bouncing on a grid, very nice) CHOPPER (a slow
anim of a helicopter rotating its propellors) and FRACZOOM (a zoom into a 
fractal).

Ref: 124
FLI ANIMATIONS 9.  Again they are ZIpped, player provided.  6 anims which are
FAN (a desktop fan blowing around), FLYING (a brilliant looped animation of
alsorts of shapes flying around a glass sphere), FULLTREK (zoom in on the
Enterprise then zoom in on a Romulan BattleCruiser), HAND (a beckoning hand,
very surreal and odd!), JELYFISH (a squidgy jellyfish, very nice), RACETRAK
(this is nice, you follow two bikes around a track, hard to explain but fun
to watch).

Ref: 125
FLI ANIMATIONS 10.  More ZIPped FLI's and a player.  7 animations which are:
HANDS (the cartoon morphing animation), LINKS (lots of links making a chain
which wobbles around, very clever animation), NUT (a spinning bolt against
a picture of what looks like a roman temple!), SNEEZE (a brilliant ray-traced
face that sneezes, very clever), SQUARES (one of my favourites, small, well
formed and well looped animation of a globe of squares moving), TURBINE (a
short sequence of a motor turbine pulling apart then forming again) and
WAVELOGO (a very nice block that ripples like water, clever indeed).

Ref: 126
The GOOD GUYS demos.  There are two demos on this disk, the first is the
Plasma demo by Spiff of the Good Guys, a very nice plasma too, good module
from Stax of Laser and nice intro picture that looks almost hand drawn with
crayons!  Then there is a nice TIFF slideshow from the Good Guys again, the
same groovy module and an odd selection of decent to poor quality TIFF pics
which all involve women (in various poses) that have had their faces changed
or morphed or extended or some other weird effect put on them.  Both are
RGB only and need 4 meg.  Should run from Floppy drive fine.  Also on this
disk is DEXTROUS.GIF a nice picture of an alternative Falcon desktop that
I think would appeal to a LOT of people out there!!!
