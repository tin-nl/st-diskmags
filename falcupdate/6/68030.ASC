      Sorry!  Due to space (or lack of it) we have not had room to
     publish this article with all its support code (there is a lot
       of it).  We will ensure it makes it onto next issues disk.



The source code shows you how to:-

Make text displayers
Show 256 colour pictures and smooth-fade them
Do colourful raster bar backgrounds
Animation
Sine-wave distortion


                   We will publish it soon, honest!!!
