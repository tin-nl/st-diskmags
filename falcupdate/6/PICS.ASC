Douglas Little, which will play a 50khz soundtrack module and display
Targa (TGA) True Colour pictures as a slide show on screen.  The
pictures on this disk are all of a raytraced theme and are of amazing
quality, they are the ones that magazines like ST Format use for
screen grabs!  The pictures are: S_BALLBO, S_BOWL, S_CAR, S_CHESS,
S_PALACE and S_ROOM.  You are supposed to get the following two disks
to complete the set.  Please note you will require a RGB display of
some kind.  All the pictures are packed (with ICE Packer) although
the slideshow can handle this a normal art package won't so you will
need to decompress them before using them.

Ref: 037
This is the second disk of the SLIDEMOD series, it contains the
instructions for the program and the soundtracker module plus another
8 pictures which are: B_FISH, F_TOMB, S_ARCHES, S_DESK, S_NTREAL,

Fancy a trip into Japanese culture and history?  Then the following
two disks are a must!  This disk contains JAPAN1.ZIP and JAPAN2.ZIP. 
You will need the following disk to complete the set if you wish to
see all the pictures but you can use the images alone if wished. 
They are all XGA format, a program called JAPAN.PRG is supplied which
will load them all into memory and display them (but you will need
14meg for this!) or you can view them induvidually using another
program.  The program is XGA SHOW, I have not tried but I would guess
this is certainly NOT going to work on a VGA monitor.  It is 100% RGB
though.

Ref: 040
This is the second disk in the Japan range, it contains JAPAN3.ZIP
and JAPAN4.ZIP.  ST Zip is NOT supplied.  You WILL need a hard drive
and RGB display to view these pictures.

Ref: 041
Another superb SLIDEMOD disk, it can be used with the others in the
range or on its own as the program, a modules and the docs are
included.  There are 6 pictures which are: ATOLL, AUTOMATE, BABY,
CHESS3, EAGLE and ROMAN.  They a mainly digitised.  You will need an
RGB display if you wish to use the SLIDEMOD.PRG.

Superb GIF's disk.  There are only five pictures on this disk (plus
the Speed of Light viewer 2.5 program) but they are of a VERY high
quality indeed.  The pictures are: ALIENS, ALIENSEA, MQ-TV, VIVID3HI
and VIVID7.  The Aliens picture is of flying saucers over San
Francisco with a nice warning slogan!  Aliensea is an amazing picture
of a head in a cracked shell over the sea - very good.  MQ-TV is a
raytraced picture of a man sat in an empty room watching TV! 
Vivid3hi and Vivid7 are both the pictures seen so often on the
monitors in PC adverts in Computer Shopper!  They are amazing
raytraced logo's with incredabile depth you can zoom in and in on
them and still get an amazing resolution picture.

Raytraced Dreams.  This disk contains 7 very high quality raytraced
JPEG format pictures.  The Brainstorm DSP JPEG viewer is supplied.
The pictures are: BALL, OCEAN, ORCA, PALIC2, PALICA, VBALL and WACKY.
 You will need some 3D glasses to get the best from PALIC2 which
contains lots of raytraced dragons around a lake all in 3D and it
really does work if you have some of those glasses!  BALL is a
standard wooden ball that has been split up into chunks, OCEAN and
ORCA feature raytraced dolphins and whales, quite amazing.  VBALL is
a clever raytraced image and WACKY is just that!  Easter Island style
heads, odd glass objects and more!

Ref: 089
Again the Brainstorm JPEG viewer is included but this time the
pictures are of a more cartoony theme.  They are: GIGER1, GW,
HARDWARE, JD, JD2, JD3 and NEMESIS.  The JD pictures are of that
famous lawman Judge Dredd.  The Nemesis picture is a painting of the
classic 2000AD character Nemesis the Warlock by Simon Bisley and it
is one of my favourite pictures of all time.  Hardware is a raytraced
picture of a few tools.  GW is a stunning raytraced picture of a
great white shark looking very mean indeed.  GIGER1 is a bizarre and
typical H.R. Giger drawing (ie very odd!).  This disk also contains
two GIF pictures which are LOGO and LYAP. LYAP is a beautiful Lyapov
fractal and is really nice, LOGO is the famous Deep Space Nine logo
from the hit TV series.

MANGA MANIA DISK!  If you are a fan of the superb Japanese animation
and comics known as Anime and Manga then this disk is for you.  You
may have heard (or even seen) films like Akira, 3X3 Eyes or Bubblegum

shows.  I have split the pictures up by show and the folders are
3X3_EYES, AKIRA, AN_STUFF, BGCRISIS and CPD.  In the 3X3_EYES folder

They all feature the wonderful Pai and Yamako.  AKIRA contains:
AKIRA_1, AKIRA_2, AKIRA_3 AND AKIRA_4.  The pictures are the typical
action scenes from the film including laser battles and the

related images from a variety of sources, there are 24 pictures in
this folder and they are: ANGLCP, ANIME1, ANIME2, AS7G2, AS8G6,

Worlds Mermaid Forest to Apple Seed and Dragon Ball Z.  The BGCRISIS
folder has 5 high-octane, bio-booster pictures of those beautilful
future warriors the Lovely Angels from the famous cyberpunk Bubble
Gum Crisis Anime.  The pictures are: BGC1, BGC2, BGC3, BGC4 and BGC5.
 Finally CPD has three pictures in it, I don't know what they are
from so I can't comment, sorry!
