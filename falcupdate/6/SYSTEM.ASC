ATARI SYSTEM SOFTWARE

As you are aware there was a bundle of software that _should_ have been
sent out with each Falcon.  However things being as they are this never
happened quite the way it should have and a lot of people were upset to
not have received this software.

Well we have obtained official permission from Atari UK to distribute
this software to those that want it.  It consists of :-

Speedo GDOS
MultiTOS
XControl + Land Mines + Breakout + Calapt + SAM
Disk full of sampled sounds for SAM

Speedo GDOS takes up 2 high density disks.  MultiTOS was given away with
issue 4 of FALCON UPDATE and the other utilities take up 2 high density
disks.

If you would like ANY of the above then simply send the correct amount of
disks and a jiffy bag WITH ENOUGH STAMPS FOR RETURN POSTAGE on it.  We
will then make sure the software finds its way to you within a week.  Plus
we may also include some other little extras that we feel you ought to have
copies of if there is enough room on the disks.

Finally you MUST also include your Falcon's serial number and details of
where you purchased it from, Atari insisted we collect this information.

Send your disks, jiffy bag and stamps to the usual FOG PDL address.
