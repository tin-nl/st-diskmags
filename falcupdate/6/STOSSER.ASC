                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Answer the following questions:

1. Are you a STOS programmer?.

2. Would you like a disk each month packed with articles and help aimed
   primarily at the STOS user?.

3. Would you like to get hold of loads of free routines and source code
   for STOS, including many exclusives?.

4. Are you just a general ST user who likes a good read?.

5. Are you a general ST user who collects diskmagazines?.

If you answered Yes to any of the above questions,  then you would be well 
advised  to get hold of a copy of STOSSER diskzine.   STOSSER is a  public 
domain  disk magazine available from the 20th of every month.   It's  never 
been late yet and by the time you read this, will be celebrating it's 
first birthday after a year of articles, reviews,  help,  source code and 
laughs.   We'd like it to continue for at least  another  year.   

If you want to get hold of a copy check  out  your favourite public domain 
library or alternatively drop me a line with a disk and stamped S.A.E. 
Don't forget to fill the disk up a bit,  because if you send it blank I'll 
send it back blank.
