In an attempt to get in touch with the programmers of the best utilities
on the Atari Falcon we contacted Michel Forget, the guy behind the great
file reader - MASTER BROWSE - here is what he had to say to us .........


(FOG) Your full name please...
(MVF) Michel V. Forget

(FOG) Your address
(MVF) Michel Forget, 12209 Dovercourt Avenue, Edmonton, 
      Alberta, Canada, T5L 4E1

(FOG) Your email address if you have one
(MVF) ess@tibalt.supernet.ab.ca
      mforget@elfhaven.ersys.edmonton.ab.ca

(FOG) Your age
(MVF) 21

(FOG) A list of FALCON programs you have been responsible for and what 
      part did you play in their creation?

(MVF) MasterBrowse    - Every version works with the Falcon, and MTOS.
      ESS-Code        - This program has odd problems with the Falcon; it
			should work in higher resolution modes, but your
			experience may vary.

(FOG) What development software do you use most? (ie DPaint, Devpac..) please 
      state the merits of these packages and why you would recommend 
      them to my readers.

(MVF) I use the Sozobon 2.0 (extended) compiler, by Jerry G. Geiger.  
      I use it because it is an excellent compiler, is absolutely free, and 
      will run in low memory situations.  It provides most of the features 
      of an ANSI compiler, and has a good set of support utilities.  The author 
      is very accessible, so problems are fixed very quickly after being 
      reported.  The other tools that I use for development include RSC 2.9, 
      ORCS, QED, ST-Guide, and ProCalc.  I also use The Atari Compendium.  
      Despite the errors in the text, it is an extremely valuable tool.

(FOG) What computers do you own at present?
(MVF) One!  :)
      I have an Atari 520STfm (2 MEGS), and a thirty megabyte hard drive.
      Not the most impressive system, but I'm not exactly rich either...  
      It does what I want it to, though, so I do not feel too bad about not
      having a Falcon.

(FOG) With unlimited resources which computers would you like to own and why?
(MVF) I would love to own a Falcon; it would be a giant leap forward into the
      future for me, since it would provide me with a faster computer capable
      of much more than my current system.  The higher resolutions of the
      Falcon would be of little use to me, but the sound capabilities would
      be a dream come true.

(FOG) Do you see your computing as just a hobby or something you wish to
      follow into the professional realms?
(MVF) I will be attending the Northern Alberta Institute Of Technology in
      September of this year, studying Computer Systems Technology.  When that
      course is complete, I will be looking for employment as a computer
      programmer writing business applications.

(FOG) How would you rate Atari's support for the Falcon?
(MVF) Badly, I'm afraid to say.  I feel that they have concentrated too much
      on the Jaguar and left Falcon owners out in the cold.

(FOG) How would you rate the software industries support for the Falcon?
(MVF) I feel that the software industry has supported the Falcon very well.
      There are many tools available to take advantage of the power of 
      the Falcon, in all aspects of computing.  The software industry is 
      doing what Atari should be doing.

(FOG) Do you feel there is enough coverage given to the Falcon in the popular
      Atari press (ie ST Format, ST Magazin, Atari User...)?
(MVF) Yes, I do think that they cover the Falcon quite well.  They more 
      or less have to, since their business rides on the fortunes of Atari,
      and Atari needs the Falcon to be a big machine to stay a force in the 
      computer industry.

(FOG) Which PD/Shareware programs would you recommend most of all? (name 3)
(MVF) 1. CoNnect   -- CoNnect is the best terminal program, for any platform.
      2. SozobonX  -- A great compiler, available at no cost.
      3. ST-Guide  -- A great HyperText system, supported by many applications.

(FOG) Which PD/Shareware programs would you suggest avoiding at all costs?
(MVF) None, really.  Every program has a use for someone, somewhere.

(FOG) Which commercial program would you suggest avoiding at all costs?
(MVF) DC Data Diet; I bought it, I hate it, and (to rub the salt in my eye
      a little more) the disk went bad.

(FOG) How long have you been in the Atari scene?
(MVF) I was very young when I was given my Atari 130XE.  I eventually 
      worked my way up to an STfm (which has been upgraded extensively) and 
      started programming about six years ago.  About three years ago I became
      active on the Usenet/Internet, which really put me in touch with the 
      Atari community.

(FOG) Do you feel your prescence is important in the Atari scene?
(MVF) I'm not sure.  I know that the programs I write are popular, but I also
      know that if I had not written them someone else (eventually) would
      have.  I try not to take myself too seriously, as many programmers get
      a bad reputation that way.

(FOG) Please give a detailed history about yourself and your computing life
      including everything from Spectrum's to ST's.  Concentrate mainly on
      things that have influenced you in a noticeble way.
(MVF) As I said, I have only owned two computers.  My 130XE, which got me
      interested in Atari, and my 520STfm, which got me interested in
      programming.  There is really not much more to say about my computing
      history, other than that hardware has not really affected my evolution
      as a programmer.  I am more strongly influenced by software.  When I see
      something done in a unique way, I try to adopt the idea and improve upon
      it.  This allows me to grow as a programmer, I think.

(FOG) What kind of music do you enjoy?
(MVF) I like the Beastie Boys, Ice-T, Bryan Adams, Technotronic, Mitsou,
      Maestro Fresh-Wes, Genesis, Prince, Boyz II Men, and En Vogue.  I enjoy
      other types of music, too, but this is what I enjoy the most.

(FOG) Name your favourite 3 films of all time please
(MVF) 1. Bloodsport     -- Violence is relaxing, what can I say?
      2. The Crow       -- Action is exciting...
      3. The Shadow.    -- I sense a trend coming on.

(FOG) Who is/was your Atari idol?  (ie AN Cool, Nic, Spaz, etc...)
(MVF) Oddly enough, I do not really have one in particular.  I've always
      looked up to the programmers in general, though, and wanted to be
      able to do what they do.

(FOG) What do you look for in a demo that makes it really stand out?
(MVF) I look for the music; the graphics are nice, but they do not evoke an
      emotional response the same way music does.

(FOG) Do you attend Atari shows/conventions?
(MVF) No; I do not think that there -are- any Atari conventions in Canada.

(FOG) Which single program are you most happy with?  (if you are a graphics
      artist then you can quote a picture, or if a musician a tune)
(MVF) Of my own, I use ESS-Code the most.  I use MasterBrowse when I need to
      read text files, but that is much less often than I need to UUEncode/
      UUDecode an archive.
      With regard to programs not written by me, I especially like CoNnect.
      It is the best terminal program available, for any platform.  CoNnect is
      very well supported, and works on the Falcon.

(FOG) Which program are you ashamed of?!
(MVF) DataLink.  If you see it, burn it.  Make it die, die, die, die...  :)

(FOG) How do you feel the Atari community is changing?
(MVF) The Atari community, to me, is just now catching up to the rest of the
      computer world.  Our applications are becomming more sophisticated, our
      utilities are on the cutting edge, and our computer systems are no
      longer outdated.  New software, such as MultiTOS, is forcing the Atari
      into the future (and taking older systems along for the ride).  On the
      down side, there are fewer and fewer registrations of Shareware
      programs.  Perhaps the market is shrinking, as some suggest.  No matter
      how you look at it, though, it is a disturbing trend.

(FOG) Which is best- Atari/Amiga/PC?
(MVF) Atari, of course!  :)  Commodore is out of business, and I do not like
      PC applications much.  The Atari does what I want, and that is good
      enough for me.

(FOG) Please tell us something about your home town where you live.
(MVF) I live in Edmonton, Alberta.  With nearly a half-million people, it is
      a large city by Canadian standards.  The weather is usually bad, but
      seems like less and less a problem when you hear about people being
      shot dead on their doorsteps in the United States.  I can live with
      the weather, I think.  :)

(FOG) Your all time favourite game?  (arcade, console or computer)
(MVF) Star Fox!  I just love that game; I've had it for more than a year now,
      and I still play it.  I also like Super Street Fighter II, and Doom.

(FOG) Atari was recently quoted as saying they are putting 100% into the Jaguar
      and nothing into the Falcon.  Do you see the Jaguar being Atari's saving
      grace?  Or will it fail and Atari go under?
(MVF) The Jaguar will save Atari, but at what cost?  I have a feeling that
      computer development from Atari will not start again for several
      years, if ever.  This does not impress me, but it is beyond my
      control so I try not to worry about it.  If Atari continues to
      sell the Falcon, that should be enough to satisfy the existing market
      and bring it into the future.  At least for a while, that is, until
      Atari resumes computer development.

(FOG) Do you feel a Jaguar computer would be a good move?
(MVF) Yes, certainly.  To have that kind of processing power in a computer
      could only be a good thing.

(FOG) What one thing would you most like to see on the Falcon?
(MVF) The DSP-Modem.  It sounds like a great tool, and I want one.  I'll
      need the Falcon itself first, though.

(FOG) Do you use MultiTOS at all, if not do you use a multi-tasking system at
      all?  (ie Geneva, MagiC...)
(MVF) I use MultiTOS, but I prefer Mag!X (MagiC).  It is the only reasonable
      choice for 8MHZ machines.  I only own the German version, but there is
      now an english version available.

(FOG) What programs are you currently working on or have plans to start soon?
(MVF) I am working on a modular replacement desktop; the main module only uses
      ~100K of memory, yet it provides features found only in the mega-desktops
      like Gemini II/NeoDesk.  The main advantage of a modular desktop is that
      it allows you to have any number of desktop operations active, yet still
      use the desktop.

(FOG) Time for a free plug, give some details about any shop/Pd library/BBS
      you feel deserves a mention because they don't get enough attention in
      the current Atari magazines.  State what they can offer my readers!
(MVF) Send me money so that I can one day afford a Falcon, please...  :)
      Other than a general plea for the support of Shareware, such as
      MasterBrowse, I cannot say much.  If I am supported, I will in turn
      support the Falcon community.

Well many thanks to Michel for completeing our interview, if you feel you
should be given a chance to be interviewed by us then send me an email
message explaining why, or send me a letter.
