Dynabusters+ by T.S.C.C

Far, far away in a distant galaxy there exists a planet called Sirius
B.  The planey is ruled by an alien race whic captured it some
centuries ago and imprisoned the population of the planey, but after
every half of a year a celebration is held called The Cybernight.  On
this night six choosen advocates of the nation of Sirius are fighting
against each other.  There can be only one winner.  The winner of
this bloody match gets a high prize - his freedom and a one-way
ticket to the blue planet where he can stay for the rest of his life.
 Seven of these Dynabusters have been gathered to a group called TSCC
the Sirisu Cybernetics Corp.  This is my tale...

Well that is the plot they give you anyway, in reality this is a
dream conversion of that hit arcade console game Dynablasters which
originated back in the 8-bit era with a game by Hudson Soft called
Eric and the Floaters.  It involves six players (each can be
controlled by someone sat around the computer) running around a maze
(there are lots to choose from) and dropping bombs here there and
everywhere in the hope they can blow up the others.  In the process
they can demolish the walls and if they are lucky there will be
hidden bonuses underneath which can do great things like give you
extended range bombs, drop more than one bomb at a time, etc... 
You'll just have to collect them all and see!  Obviously some can be
quite nasty but work those out for yourself.

I have to confess the programmers have done a superb job with this
game, its fun, addictive, manic and the graphics and presentation is
second to none.  There are some brilliant demo like effects, the
sound is excellent (6 channel no less!) and the sampled sounds are a
dream with alsorts of odd samples, speaking and funny little effects
which really spice the game up.

If there is one critacism its that the other players cannot be made
to be computer controlled which is a shame, but I guess it just means
you'll have to get out there and make some friends, bring them back
and blow them sky high!

It runs in ST LOW on a RGB or VGA and even works with NVDI installed!
