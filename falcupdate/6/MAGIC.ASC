MagiC Multitasking Operating System

I don't care how you spell it, Mag!X or MagiC or whatever, this is
looking like being one of the best operating system replacements for
Atari computers.  What follows is a press release which should give
you enough information to begin with, we will cover MagiC in full
depth once the Falcon version is released this October.  Until then
here is what ST owners can experience...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

With MagiC installed, you will have a completely new approach to
using your computer.  For a start you will benefit from a faster feel
to running your programs.  MagiC completely replaces the TOS
operating system in your computer, which means that it runs on all
Atari ST\STE\Mega or TT systems.  The Falcon version is expected in
October 1994.  MagiC is intelligent enough to give you the priority
when you need it, so no more slow typing while other programs are
running!

Key features of MagiC

o     Pre-emptive multitasking with up to 16 programs.  If you use   
      all six accessory-slots, you can still keep 10 programs
      (including the desktop) in memory.

o     Up to 64 windows open at the same time.

o     Comfortable operation by way of a completely new graphics
      user-interface.  This allows rapid and simple switching between
      different program-menus.

o     Help for programmers to track down errors and a Program Manager
      for "freezing" or removing deadlocked applications from memory.

o     Printer, Serial and Midi ports benefit from accelerated
      routines.

o     Extended dialog functions, additional system calls for flying
      dialogs, keyboard shortcuts within dialogs, pop-up menus, etc.

o     High compatibilty with TOS, critical programs can be run in
      single-tasking mode.  Compatible with accelerator-boards and
      graphic add-ons.

o     Drastically improved security prevents "dirty" programs from
      influencing others.  After such a program has crashed, MagiC
      cleans up the system so that other programs will remain
      functional in most cases.

o     Newly developed desktop MAGXDESK with user-defined icons and
      extensive functions.

o     Programs have dramatically increased speed of execution in
      comparison with the original system.
