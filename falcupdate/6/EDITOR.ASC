            FALCON UPDATE DIGITAL - Issue 6 - Editorial
            -=========================================-


Unless you are a new reader to Falcon Update you will no doubt have 
noticed a few not-so subtle changes to the disk magazine shell.  If 
you  are  a  seasoned reader then I can but  only  hope  you'll  be 
rubbing  your hands together and jumping for joy shouting 'no  more 
ST emulation modes for a Falcon disk-mag!'.  You can attribute this 
new incarnation to a combination of HiSoft Basic 2.10,  some  smart 
Douglas Little routines and a long boring summer holiday in which I 
sat down and toiled over this shell.

So  that  means the bugs can be sent to me  for  ironing  out,  and 
please  do send them - after all how else am I supposed to  improve 
on it?  But, placing shells firmly in the background for the moment 
lets get on with the editorial.

%*%*%*%*%*%
% A SIGN? % As I was  attending the  annual Bristol Balloon Fiesta,
%*%*%*%*%*% in which many hot-air balloon pilots and clubs from all 
over  Europe  take-part,  I was pleased to see  that  the  Motorola 
balloon  made it up into the air and away well ahead of  the  Intel 
one  or  the  IBM one for that matter.   Sadly,  look  as  I  might 
amongst  all the 'novelty' balloons (ie balloons shaped liked  the 
Caramel 'bunny' or the flying Fire Extinguisher) I failed to notice 
a floating Jaguar.   Oh well, maybe Atari will have that marketing 
strategy covered in time for next years event.

They may not be flying across our skies,  but the Jaguar is  firmly 
imbedded into the local department stores around here.  I was quite 
impressed  when  I  visited one store in search of  a  'play  free' 
Jaguar running Tempest 2000,  that in the Atari section they had  a 
Falcon and monitor on a stand for the public to look at.   The only 
unfortunate  thing about it was that nothing was active,  plus  the 
monitor  was only an RGB so it couldn't have shown much up  against 
the PC's in the next room if it had wanted to.   Not that I  expect 
the  shop  assistants knew how to use it anyway.   They  were  also 
trying  desperately  to sell the 1meg machines in lue of  the  cheap 
Commodore A1200's on other stands.   This made me so angry I wanted 
to  rip the posters down from the wall,  but rather than spend  the 
night in a comfy English cell courtesy of Her Majesties  Police,  I 
chose to write to them instead.  I explained how willing I would be 
to  supply  them with some SIMPLE TO USE sample  software  to  have 
running for the public.  If they reply I'll let you all know.

I recently attended the Bristol Atari Show, sponsored (as usual) by 
Compo,  Titan  Design and System Solutions,  with  the  double-page 
colour  spread backing of Europress and ST Review.   I was glad  to 
see many old faces there,  Clive Parker, Vic Lennard, Neil O'nions, 
Mike  Goodman  et all,  but there was also a  few  vitals  missing.  
HiSoft  for  one.   The venue was the trendy  Hilton  International 
Conference centre, well one of its' suites anyway.  The room wasn't 
so  big,  at a first glance you had the impression you  could  zoom 
around  it  in about 5mins flat.   Thankfully there was  more  than 
enough to hold you there for at least 2 hours.

Compo  were  showing  their new software including  Musicom  2  and 
Screen Eye.   Goodman's PD were flogging PD by the bucket-load, but 
then what else would you expect them to do?  Europress were selling 
off ST Review and ST User but at full-price,  even though they  had 
promised  a special 'show discount'.   Merlin PD had a  nice  large 
stand with plenty of commercial wares and other alsorted 'bits' and 
all  the  Merlin  staff had matching  (bottle-green)  t-shirts  and 
Merlin baseball caps, just as well they decided against dressing as 
Merlin the wizard methinks.   By far the most interesting stall was 
Brad  Koda's BEST ELECTRONICS stand,  where,  for a  price,  almost 
everything  and  anything Atari could be  bought.   He  had  Jaguar 
controllers,  PCB's,  replacement  mouse  balls,  keyclicks,  Atari 
coffee mugs,  Atari pin-badges and much more.   I am now the  proud 
owner of a fine golden Atari fuji-logo lapel pin, a worthy purchase 
I feel.

The overall feeling was of an Atari club get together rather than a 
consumer  show,  but  this  is no  bad  thing.   Instead  of  being 
overwhelmed  by  cheque-book waving hagglers,  the  people  on  the 
stands were interested and friendly enough to want to chat.  I have 
no idea how many people passed through the doors during the day but 
I  can but hope it was enough to warrant them running another  show 
sometime soon.  I'll be there, just look for the guy with the Atari 
lapel-pin badge and the smug grin on his face.


%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*
% Times are changing % Readers of ST FORMAT (god-help us all) can't 
%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%* have failed to notice  their round-up of the
Falcon PD and Shareware scene in their most recent issue.   A  good 
thing you may think?   After all, every little exposure to the fine 
selection of Falcon PD/Shw available is a blessing right?  Wrong.

Not  only were the 'reviews' (and I use that term loosely)  boring, 
factually incorrect and,  to be honest,  utter crap.  But they also 
had the audacity to rate the software with a few stars depending on 
how good or bad they thought it was.   A typical review was nothing 
more  than  a  few  senseless  words  strung  together  giving   no 
indication of what the program actually did anyway.  The PD was old 
(yes even by Falcon standards) and unfairly treated.   The reviewer 
wrote with a tone much akin to someone on downers who has  suffered 
a bad hangover and needs somewhere to take his anguish out on.   It 
was a pain to read.   But one good thing has come of it all  (apart 
from again showing the juvenile quality of _some_ of the ST  FORMAT 
bunch),  I  am going to do my own Falcon PD round-up.   It will  be 
concise, but informative, current, and will be in the next issue.
Suggestions  of your favourite PD programs you wanted  featured  to 
the usual address/email please.

%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%
% Bye for now % I'll be back, in a months time  or so, with another
%*%*%*%*%*%*%*% issue  of FALCON UPDATE  DIGITAL.  I  don't know if
you will be here with me, but I can only hope you will and that you 
stay loyal, stay Atari and stay happy.

Kind regards,
