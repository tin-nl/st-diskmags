                      FALCON PD AND SHAREWARE GAMES
                      =============================

Ref: 020
OXYD is the now classic Dongleware game and it needs a VGA monitor in
order to play it.  Move your marble around knocking the switches to
allow safe passage into the next zone.  You will have to register if
you want to go past level 10.  A very good game indeed, nice
presentation and sound effects.  VGA only.  SPACOLA is another
Dongleware game, this time its almost like asteroids, except there
are more aliens than rocks!  Zoom around in this mono hi-res game and
waste the baddies and collect the goodies.  There are some superb
sound effects built into this one.  VGA and also RGB.

Ref: 043
Amoungst lots of other things this disk contains the game LAMEMINES
and MARIO.  Lamemines as you might expect is a version (and a very
hard one at that) of the popular PC Window's classic.  Only this time
you have a huge screen to clear and alsorts of samples!  MARIO
involves you driving what looks like a womble in a go-cart around a
track!  No skill involved, just mindless fun for a few seconds.

Ref: 046
NETHACK is the new revised edition, needs 2 meg, is best with a VGA
and is very, very large indeed!  The text based RPG characters have
been replaced with graphics and icons and I can promise you many
sleepless nights are to be had.  VERTICAL MAYHEM is a nice little
columns clone ported from the Amiga by Griff of Electronic Images.

Ref: 050
LASERS AND MEN.  This is the first ever attempt at a Wolfenstien 3D
game on the Falcon, and it works... just!  The graphics are crude at
the moment, but the playability is there.  Let's just hope they can
speed things up a little for the next version.

Ref: 053
OXYD RGB yes its the Dongleware classic but now its been fixed so it
works on RGB displays.  MAHJONG is a detailed version of the classic
board game which I am yet to work out how to play!

Ref: 054
FALCON TRON is exactly that!  No matter how nicely you dress up a
tron game with flashy graphics and sound its always going to involve
moving a line around a screen in an attempt to destroy other lines! 
Still at least this is a very nice version of it.  RGB only.  MADTRIS
is a wild and crazy idea for a game, take Tetris and make the blocks
fall in from the sides (like Welltris but not 3D!) oh its hard to
explain and even harder to play, confusing but entertaining.  RGB
only.  MASTERS OF CHAOS, now this is special - a deep and involved
Dungeon Master style game for one or two players (or 4 via link up)
plenty to do and see, nice graphics and nice sound effects.  RGB
only.

Ref: 079
TRIYAHOO this is a version of Yahtzee for the Falcon and it is more
flexible and compatible than lots of applications I can mention!  The
game involves rolling dice and making sets like a small straight or a
full house.  It is a really good game once you get into it and the
presentation is top notch as are the sound effects.  My highest score
on a three card yahtzee is 2060 - anyone beat that?  Excellent stuff!
STELLO is the most detailed game of Othello you will ever play, and
whats more you will never be able to beat the computer because it is
so damn smart!  You can even load pictures into the background of the
board (and several tasty example are provided).  Very very good but
frustratingly difficult.

Ref: 083
STARBALL.  Every once in a while along comes a PD game that makes you
think - WOW! - and I promise you this is one of them!  Pinball games
are not very easy to do and the PD versions available are far and few
between.  But pinball games of this calibre are VERY rare, indeed
this is the best pinball game I have ever played on an Atari,
commercial or otherwise.  The graphics are very very very good (I
want to stress that point!) as are the sound effects, whats more you
can choose your own soundtracker modules to play in the background
should you so desire.  There are four tables and plenty of bonus
screens including a Llamatron screen!  Very addictive playing and
very clever, register your copy now because I promise you are going
to love this one.  Balls of a different kind can be found in Parx's
MULTIBALL its like pong but with four players, lots of balls and
manic fun indeed!  Get two Atari power pads plugged in and four
people can go crazy around your Falcon as you bounce the balls into
each others areas.  Wild fun, superbly presented and GREAT music,
shame its RGB only.

Ref: 084
There are other things on this disk (mpeg animations) along with UFO
WAR a nifty little two player blast - em - up.  It runs in RGB
overscan and you pilot your little craft around trying desperatly to
destroy the other player - well best of luck to you because this is a
tricky little number!  Again flawless presentation and music.

Ref: 090
BLACK HOLE gee this is an odd game!  It works on a VGA or RGB in 256
colour mode and ... well to be quite honest I havn't a bloody clue
what you are supposed to do in it!  The help files are not very
helpful.  If there is one thing about this game it has to be the
sampled sound effects - quite amazing for sure, well worth ripping
out!  COLOUR CLASH is a brilliant little ST game from Animal Soft
that I have fixed to run on the Falcon.  Guide your chameleon across
the screen, zapping blocks, inflating yourself and exploding!!!  Its
great fun and a good puzzle game, well written and, well I love it,
so that is why its here!  POTHOLE 2 is a boulderdash clone of the
highest order, enough said really, if your idea of fun is rushing
around collecting diamonds avoiding falling rocks and baddies then
welcome to heaven!!!

Ref: 101
LASERS AND MEN this is the new updated version, sure the character
graphics are still not complete, but the scenery is amazing!!  You
can now walk through fog, trees, coffee tables (?!) and admire the
wonderful scenery of pictures and fractal patterns.  Once this is
over, kick-start your laser-pack and go blast some bad guys, because
they are everywhere!  This version has nice sound effects, music and
better graphics and speed.  Can't wait for the next update!  Also on
this disk is TRIMOD and lots of MegaTizer music, see the music
section for more information.

Ref: 131
WORLD CONQUEST is the poor man's Civilisation, a strategy war game where
all you have to do to win, is defeat the other race by building up ships
and planes and tanks and plundering the enemy lands.  DYNABUSTERS PLUS is
an amazing arcade game with superb DMA sampled sounds, its a conversion 
of the classic Hudson Soft game Dyna Blaster (which was originally called
Eric and the Floaters when released on the 8-bits!).  Up to 6 people can
play at once and its mayhem all round.  The graphics are brilliant and
the gameplay is so addictive me and my friend spent a whole 4 hours doing
nothing but playing this game!  It's well worth getting if you have somone
(or even better, lots of people) to play it with.  RGB and VGA, run in ST
LOW.  SNACKMAN is the best pacman clone available for any Atari machine.
Apart from enhanced graphics and sound on the Falcon this game reeks of 
polish and professionalism and is very, very addictive.  You can even have
two player games where one of you is the ghost!  Falcon Fixed by FOG - full
docs are included.  TRIVIA is a simple multiple-choice game of general
trivia and some of the questions are VERY hard indeed!  But it's good, hectic
fun and you will certainly learn a thing or two.  WALZ is another variation
on the breakout theme, again the usual power-ups fall from the sky making
your bat bigger or smaller or making the ball stick or speed up or whatever
else the programmers decided to code.  The sound effects are nice and it will
also run in any resolution.  TAUTOLOGY is a superb version of the classic
Shanghai game where-by you match pairs of tiles to remove them from the board
the ultimate aim being to remove all the tiles in the time given.  You can
draw your own tile sets with this version and it is highly configureable,
nice music and very addictive gameplay indeed.  RGB only, dies a miserable
death on VGA monitors.  All games work on RGB and VGA unless otherwise stated.
