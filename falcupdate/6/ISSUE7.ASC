This  will be a special two-disk issue.   Yes 3 meg of _compressed_  disk 
magazine  with a lot more free software and some other stunning  bits  to 
set your chips on fire.

Why?   Well  because it's the last issue unless I get some feedback  from 
you, the readers.

Simple  as that.   If you can't be bothered to write some small  articles 
for me then I can't be bothered to publish any more.  The PD library will 
stay very much alive,  as will our prescence on the Internet,  but  other 
than that forget it.


           You have a month or two to do something about this
                         It's in your hands now.
