Academy Awards of Interactive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lisa Goldman is on a mission. For the past two years, she has been on the
road and on the phone, in search of the future of interactive multimedia.
As director of the upcoming Interactive Media Festival, Goldman is trying
to hunt down the planet's  best interactive art and design to showcase at
the Los Angeles Convention Center June 6-8. She and event organizers
recently announced the selection of a 75-member international "Delegation
of Nominators" that will select "significant examples of  interactivity"
in film, art, music, publishing, computers, and consumer electronics.

"We want to get to the essence of what makes good interactive multimedia,"
Goldman said over the phone, between stops in London and Switzerland.
"We're looking at the greatest possible diversity of expression and the
widest possible geographical  representation."

The nominating committee list reads like a Who's Who of the world of
digital art, entertainment, and commerce. Each of the nominators will
choose two works for consideration. The festival, in seeking out the best
in this emerging medium, has set no  categories and is open to any type of
material. Rather than rely on slides or videotapes in making its
selections, the festival jury will evaluate each work in its native form,
whether it's on a specific computer platform or at an interactive theme
park. "It will be fascinating to see whether multimillion-dollar
productions and projects developed on shoestring budgets end up
side-by-side in the festival," said Harvie Branscomb, who is overseeing
the competition part of the festival.

The Interactive Media Festival has established an Internet mailbox
(info-request@media.festival.com) where developers, artists, and others
can get more information on the festival and post descriptions of projects
for possible consideration in the  event. The festival is, in the words of
its press release, "Powered by Motorola," and is a joint venture of
Seybold Seminars and the public relations firm Cunningham Communications.

Holy Ghost in the Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Greg Garvey isn't expecting his Automatic Confession Machine to become a
regulation church fixture any day soon. Instead, Garvey, an artist and
lapsed Catholic, is showing off the computerized confessional on the
nascent electronic-art circuit.

Here's how it works: A penitent, perhaps attracted by the red neon cross
or the stereoscopic image of a winking Christ, steps up to the gleaming
black Plexiglas kiosk and kneels on the machine's red naugahyde stool. To
start the confession, the user  presses the Amen key, then selects from a
menu of the seven deadly sins and the Ten Commandments. The
priest-in-a-chip asks the user a series of questions, taking a special
interest in sins of the flesh.

After the confession, the machine's expert system prints out the
prescribed penance on a handy wallet-size slip of paper and signs off with
a blessing.

The Automatic Confession Machine (ACM) wasn't created as a "diatribe
against the Catholic Church," Garvey says, but as a method of examining
the way that "technology has intruded into our lives, mediating what used
to be human-to-human transactions."

Despite the system's manifest advantages - Garvey says it can conveniently
provide the Church with a vast datastream for spotting sin trends among
the flock - the ACM is unlikely to spring from gallery hall to hallowed
hall anytime soon.

In order for the ACM to be anything more than an artist's prank, the
software must be ordained. "Not likely," admits Greg Garvey, "but one must
bear in mind that the Church only recently admitted to the correctness of
Galileo." Garvey's e-mail  address: ggarvey@vax2.concordia.ca.

Telegeography The Balance of Global Telecommunications Traffic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In 1992 the people of the planet Earth spent a total of 40 billion minutes
on the phone. To be more exact, they spent 40 billion minutes (or 76,000
years) sending information over telephone lines: voices, faxes, e-mail,
and plain old data. But for  most of those billions of telephone-minutes
only the caller paid for the connection, even though both a caller and a
callee benefited from a conversation.

The asymmetrical nature of communication costs are reflected in this
global map of telegeography for 1992. The red-colored areas denote
countries that make more calls than they receive (thus incurring a deficit
in the global telecommunications cost  balance). The blue denotes
countries with more incoming than outgoing calls (a surplus);
yellow-colored countries have a balance (outgoing and incoming traffic
with less than a 10 percent difference); uncolored areas mean there is no
data.

The United States ran a deficit by initiating (and paying for) 3 billion
more minutes of telecommunications than it received. Other deficit
sponsors of outgoing calls were Germany and Saudi Arabia (with many guest
workers), Switzerland (where fully  5 percent of all phone calls are
international connections), and Japan.

An analysis of international phone usage suggests that social calls last
longer than business (or "instrumental") calls by a factor of ten - 20 to
30 minutes talking to Aunt Maria compared with 2 to 3 minutes
communicating to Abdul on the factory  floor.

Gregory Staple, editor of the monograph TeleGeography, from which this map
is adapted, suggests that the huge telecommunication deficit of the US
should be considered part of its service environment, and a bargain in the
new information economics.

Electronic Paperbacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When NEC and Fujitsu developed their handheld electronic book players,
they decided not to use CD-ROMs. All that storage would be wasted on the
trashy novels, self-help guides, and comic books that straphangers on
Japan's overcrowded trains like to  read. Instead, both players will use
writable media. NEC's Digital Book Player has floppies, while Fujitsu's
View Art uses memory cards.

Fujitsu is still dithering over whether to turn its prototype into a
commercial product, but NEC's device went on sale in Japan in early
November, with a list price of Yen29,800 (around US$300). NEC says that it
plans to ship one million units over  the next three years, and has
announced an initial 30-odd titles, with over 100 scheduled to be
avail-able by the end of the year.

Which medium suits you better - floppies or memory cards - depends on how
much you're willing to pay for low weight. Floppy disks cost next to
nothing, but are heavy and power-hungry. Memory cards are expensive - 512
Kbytes worth will set you back  about US$200 at current prices - but light
and energy-efficient. And, as Fujitsu points out, you just need one card
for your reader: They envisage downloading (probably via NiftyServe, a
local, Fujitsu-sponsored version of CompuServe) books onto  cards.

The other difference between the two players is the interface. Fujitsu's
player features just two buttons plus an on/off switch. You only need one
thumb to operate it. NEC's player forces you to contend with ten twiddly
buttons.

Of course, electronic book readers, being made largely from off-the-shelf
components and containing little in the way of proprietary technology,
will be kid's stuff to clone. The real money is going to be in the books -
just ask the subway commuters  who tear through a different 300-page manga
(Japanese comic book) every day on their way home from work. NEC Corp: +81

Robot War Games
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here's an old movie plot: To minimize the human impact of war, the nations
of the world agree to have robots do the fighting. Of course, one side is
bound to not like the outcome ("It wuz fixed...we wuz robbed") and so may
start a war over that.

The plot may be fiction, but the robot battle is real. Marc Thorpe is
waging the first "Robot Wars" on August 20 and 21, 1994 at Fort Mason in
San Francisco. "I don't feel uncomfortable about destruction," says
Thorpe. "Promoting combat between  robots instead of people is a healthy
alternative. That it's aggressive, combative, and survival-oriented gives
it a kind of energy that professional football has."

Thorpe has launched a PR blitz for "Robot Wars," inviting mad mechanics,
technophiles, and movie special-effects teams to build radio-controlled
robots designed to rip, punch, and impale each other to scrap metal and
frayed rubber while onlookers  scream like ancient Romans at the
Colosseum. And if mere robot opponents aren't enough, hydraulic shears and
presses placed within the 40-by-60-foot arena will chomp, stomp, and
sayonara any dull-witted robot who happens to linger too long in the
wrong place.

There are three contests: one-on-one survival of the fittest, a mob scene,
and the neatest, where your bot has to escort a defenseless dronebot
across the arena. The three weight classes were set up so your delicate,
25-pound, eighteen-legged  centipede doesn't have to face a 100-pound
crusher with a snorting chainsaw for a beak. And it's not quite "anything
goes" - no explosives, corrosives, fire breathing dragons, or "untethered
projectiles" (guns); no radio jamming or interfering with  the other human
operators allowed. Entry fees per robot are US$50 for individuals and $500
for corporations. (It's a business expense: Put your logos where the TV
cameras can see them.)

Comix Redux
^^^^^^^^^^^
Comic Power: Independent/ Underground Comix is a massive traveling exhibit
chronicling 30 years of underground and independent comix. For the
uninitiated, comix are not about superheroes. They venture into territory
that aboveground comics rarely  acknowledge: relationships, politics,
angst, and sexuality. The content and format of comix are constrained only
by the imagination of the cartoonists, not by the blue pencil of corporate
censors.

This show is remarkable for its number of artists and amazing array of
styles and subject matter. Included are over 90 artists and 250 pieces,
ranging from single panels to full stories. Among these are the famous:
Robert Crumb ("Zap"), Bill  Griffith ("Zippy the Pinhead"), Art Spiegelman
("Raw" and "Maus"), and Matt Groening ("Life in Hell"). But there are also
many lesser-known but destined-to-become-famous artists such as Gilbert
and Jaime Hernandez ("Love and Rockets"), Chester Brown  ("Yummy Fur"),
and Julie Doucette ("Dirty Plotte").

Also included are two historical sub-shows: one of blacklisted political
artists, curated by hyperpolitical painter Sue Coe; and one of newspaper
strips from 1898 to 1945 that includes early comic art geniuses Windsor
McKay ("Little Nemo") and  George Herriman ("Krazy Kat"), among others.

The sheer size of the show (running at the Vancouver Art Gallery from
April 15, 1994 through June 15,1994, then at the Dunlop Art Gallery in
Regina, Saskatchewan, September 7-18, 1994) is daunting. There is very
little filler, and Comic Power  requires many hours of viewing to digest.
That said, the show effectively demonstrates that comix really can be art
and literature, still maintaining that precious ability to rot our brains.

Network of the Stars
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A programmer debugs a mainframe from his living room across town, a broker
in Seattle studies his NYSE screen for blue-chip trades - now common
occurrences thanks to digital telecommunications. In the entertainment
industry, San Francisco-based  Entertainment Digital Network (EDnet) is
rapidly convincing producers, performers, and entertainment executives
that traveling the information superhighway can save them from real-time
gridlock as well. But how does a musician or actor telecommute?

Using fiber-optic lines to transmit digital signals, EDnet has
established, in two years, a global network of nearly 80 sound studios and
editing houses. The web allows exchange of high-quality audio, compressed
video, and multimedia data  transmission. Combining entertainment-industry
and technical expertise with digital telecommunications, the fledgling
company hopes to "enable creative talent in the industry to be virtually
anywhere," says David Gustafson, EDnet's vice president of  marketing.

The company's high-tech connections allowed actor Ben Kingsley to
re-record spoken parts of last year's Searching For Bobby Fischer from
London, and Tom Selleck used EDnet to record his voice-over for the AT&T
i-Plan commericals. Duets, Frank  Sinatra's latest CD, found the crooner
in Los Angeles, singing with Liza Minelli in Brazil and Bono in New York
over EDnet's lines. For filmmakers, the company connects Lucas Digital's
Skywalker Sound South in Santa Monica with its Northern  California
counterpart, allowing directors hundreds of miles away to supervise audio
mixes and remotely control high-speed dubbing projetors, as Ron Howard did
for Backdraft.

EDnet claims that it owes its success to entertainers' growing preference
for working and living nearer to their families and away from hubs like
Los Angeles and New York. Talent can use local EDnet-affiliated sites to
reduce the need for travel or  courier systems. Pop star Gloria Estefan
will shortly connect her own in-home studio with the network, which
requires some US$9,500 for hardware, plus monthly and hourly operating
costs and fiber-optic connection charges. Video links run from  $15,000 to
$20,000.

So has telecommuting come to the entertainment community? Comparing his
company's services to the intimacy of a live studio setting, Technical
Services Manager John Wheeler explains: "The interaction is still there;
the producer has a very intimate  relationship with [a performer] behind
glass in a darkened room. The only difference now is that the glass
happens to be 3,000 miles thick." EDnet: +1 (415) 274 8800.

Security Through Obscurity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The cypherpunks' latest contribution to privacy is called "Stego" and
comes from Romana "Cypherella" Machado, a software developer (at left),
from Cupertino, California.

Stego uses steganography, an encryption-like technique that complements,
rather than replaces, more familiar encryption methods such as Phil
Zimmermann's PGP (see WIRED 1.6, page 25). Instead of creating a message
or file that draws attention to  itself because it looks like secret code,
Stego camouflages messages inside innocuous digitized picture files.

This is possible because of the way pictures are stored in a computer.
Every picture is made up of millions of pixels (picture elements), each of
which is made up of a string of bits. For example, a monochrome picture
might have 8-bit pixels, giving  the image 256 different shades of gray,
from totally black to totally white.

Stego uses the least significant bit (LSB) in each pixel to hold one bit
of the hidden message. In half the cases, the LSB will remain the same.
The rest of the time, the shade of the pixel will be altered 1/256 in
grayness - completely undetectable  with the naked eye.

Stego is fully compatible with more traditional forms of encryption. This
means you can encrypt your deepest secrets using PGP and then hide the
resulting cyphertext in your favorite swimsuit photo of Claudia Schiffer
or Fabio. The bad guys have to  jump through two hoops to get at your
secrets. First, they have to figure out that the bathing beauty has more
to hide than is apparent at first glance. Second, they must crack your
traditional encryption.

Stego is shareware. It's free via anonymous ftp from
sumex-aim.stanford.edu in the info-mac/Recent directory. If you like the
shareware version of Stego, you can register your copy for US$15 and get
periodic updates and additional features.

As of this writing, Stego is only available for Apple Macintosh PICT
format files. Work is currently underway to port Stego to PCs and other
platforms. In addition, future versions of Stego will be able to hide
messages in other media such as  digital audio and video. Romana Machado's

Needling a Virtual Cadaver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dr. George Sheplock has designed "Brachial Plexus Blocks," a Mac-based
medical simulation that combines the richness of textbooks with the
hands-on experience of a lab exercise. The simulation lets anesthesia
residents practice doing nerve blocks  (injecting a nerve with a compound
such as novocaine) by manipulating a simulated needle, using the mouse.
Trainees are able to practice placing the needle on the patient and then
quickly getting clinical responses, such as the "patient" hollering,
"Ouch! Do you know what you're doing?"

According to Sheplock, a major in the US Air Force, staff
anesthesiologist, and director of academic computing at the Wilford Hall
Medical Center of Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, the main emphasis of
the program is to help students visualize  anatomy by bringing the
experience of an actual cadaver dissection to a clinical setting. Students
can call up images of the patient's underlying anatomy, looking at layers
of muscle, nerves, and arteries based on digitized photographs of
cadavers.  They can also study 3-D illustrations of nerve structures,
which can be rotated and viewed from various angles. Contact George

The Interactive Electric Sumo Scream Show
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Toshio Iwai is an innovator in Japan's game, art, and TV worlds. He
doesn't make shoot-'em-up or beat-'em-up interactivity. His "Music
Insects," a computer toy developed for San Francisco's Exploratorium
science museum, allows users to make music  with the help of digital
insects. After the user paints a picture on a screen, the bugs - each with
a different musical timbre or rhythmic personality - crawl over
different-colored areas and play pitches assigned to those colors. Some
bugs play the  drums.

Iwai's latest hit is a Japanese television show called Ugo Ugo Lhuga
(Go-Go Girl pronounced backwards - sort of). Ostensibly a children's
program, many of its fans are from the nightclub and art scenes who tune
in every day for a dose of psychedelic  cartoon fun. In the show, which
incorporates surrealistic Amiga image files manipulated in real-time, two
children travel through virtual worlds with virtual characters (whose lips
are synched to live narrators via MIDI signals). The soundtrack is  also
live, with some of Tokyo's hippest "rave" DJs doing their thing.

Besides its atypical imagery - a "Mr. Feces" that rises out of the toilet
to share a daily piece of wisdom (no kidding!), a museum of sounds of
different animals mating, and a tomato on the verge of a nervous breakdown
- there are also interactive  spots. Take "Voice Sumo" for example. Kids
from all over Japan draw monsters on postcards and send them in. The
drawings are scanned into the computer and put into a cartoon sumo ring,
poised for battle. Kids phone up the show, choose a side, and  scream as
loud as they can into the phone. Whoever raises the highest voltage over
the phone pushes the opponent's creature out of the sumo ring. Now that's
interactivity.

Credit Card Abuse Made Even Simpler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you use Quicken for your personal finances and you're tired of typing
your credit card charges into your computer at the end of every month, the
folks at Intuit (Quicken's publisher) have a new product that they would
like to sell you: a Visa  card with an electronic monthly statement.

It works like this: At the end of each month, Primerica Bank, the card's
backer, sends each Intellicharge customer a traditional monthly statement.
A few days later, you'll get a floppy disk in the mail containing the
electronic version of your  statement. Pop it into the disk drive, then
tell Quicken you want to reconcile your statement. Quicken will read the
charges off the floppy (automatically matching up the ones you've already
typed), mark the charges as "cleared," then give you the  option of paying
the minimum payment, the full statement balance, or a value of your choice.

Intuit says that the Primerica Visa has "no annual fee," but after the
first six months you'll be charged US$4.50 a month for "electronic
statement delivery." If you choose, you can avoid the floppy disk and get
the statement by modem for only $3.

My advice? Take Intuit's six-month free ride, then decide whether the
monthly fee is worth the time you'll save entering the charges manually.
Quicken: US$69.95. Intuit: (800) 624 9060, +1 (415) 322 0573.

OneNet
^^^^^^
FirstClass BBS software has an intuitive graphical-user interface,
quickness, and clean design that's attracting many users (including
Senator Ted Kennedy, whose home office runs a FirstClass BBS in
Massachusetts). Among the hobbyists who use  FirstClass software is a
fellow by the name of Scott Converse (left). In the fall of '92, when
Converse received a FirstClass upgrade that had the ability to connect
conferences, messages and files between other FirstClass BBSs, he invited
other  sysops to become a network, called OneNet.

The response was enthusiastic - the Mac-based OneNet began garnering
affiliates at the rate of five a week, and the system currently comprises
more than 250 separate BBSes, as far-flung as London, Hong Kong, Berlin,
Tokyo, Sydney, Toronto, and  Barcelona. Converse estimates that OneNet now
has 300,000 users. Some OneNet boards are free, others offer an average of
20 minutes of free logon time per day - and charge a subscriber's fee for
additional access time.

"It is sometimes easy to forget that the OneNet is little more than a year
old," says Bernard Aboba, author of The Online User's Encyclopedia and a
BMUG (Berkeley Macintosh User's Group) administrator. According to Aboba,
"OneNet will become the  largest Macintosh-oriented bulletin board
network. At its current rate of growth, sometime in 1995 it will become
the fifth largest store and forward network in terms of membership, behind
FidoNet, UUCP, WWIVNet, and BITNET. By then it will probably  also be
among the top networks in terms of conference traffic." And as a global
conferencing environment, its numbers will stack up well against
established systems like America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy.

FirstClass client software is available via ftp from
info-mac-request@sumex-aim.stanford.edu in the info-mac/comm directory.
