     [Note  -  I've tended to use the word "game" here  rather  a 
lot;  we do,  of course, release serious utilities, disk mags and 
the  like,  but you eventually run out of synonyms for  "release" 
and "game" is as good as any of them.]

     Organised  Chaos  Licenceware is  very,  very  probably  the 
finest  and fairest licenceware house in the world.  Ah  yes.  If 
washing  powders  and  toothpastes  can  get  away  with  almost-
definitive claims like that, then so can we.

     With OCL,  we put the programmers first.  Royalties are paid 
on  a  strictly sales-related basis - none of this "a  tenner  no 
matter  how  well your game did" foolishness we see  inherent  in 
Budgie  UK.  If your game is good enough to shift a  few  hundred 
copies,  you'll  see a lot of cash being thrown at you.  It  also 
gives  an incentive to produce top-notch games - the  better  you 
make your game, the better the reviews, the larger the sales, and 
you end up getting more money. Lovely. This also works out rather 
well for the punters, who end up buying better quality titles.

     OCL  titles are distributed through PD  libraries,  for  the 
most part.  This is a nicely symbiotic arrangement, beneficial to 
both  parties  -  here  at  OCL  we  don't  have  to  fret  about 
advertising and selling the stuff purely from OCL HQ,  and the PD 
libraries enjoy a nice cut of the profits for their troubles. 

     From each OCL game sold, the PD library takes two pounds, to 
cover  the effort they put it on  advertising,  distribution  and 
everything.  Titles  released on two disks see the  PD  libraries 
taking a bit more, but it's usually just two squid.

     All of the rest goes to the programmer.  If your title sells 
for  a fiver,  and shifts a hundred copies in its first  quarter, 
you'll  get  three  hundred  pounds.  As  well  as  this,  you're 
perfectly entitled to sell your game from home - selling it for a 
fiver will get you four-fifty or something per sale, depending on 
how  cheaply  you can get disks and whether you  bought  lots  of 
stamps before the last postage-price increase.

     Funding  for  OCL  (it does cost us a fair  bit  to  release 
games;  we  have to send copies to all our  distributors)  should 
hopefully  be  covered from the money we get through  direct  OCL 
orders  (when folk buy games straight from OCL HQ,  we get  about 
one-fifty  left over once we subtract stamp and disk  costs,  and 
royalties). Order from Chaos, as they say.

     OCL is probably (probably,  Mr Lawyer,  not definitely)  the 
most helpful licenceware group around.  If you're struggling with 
a  project of yours - you can't work out how to code part of  it, 
you're  stuck for ideas,  you could do with a loading  screen  or 
some  title  music  - we can help.  In  fact,  we  get  hideously 
involved  in your work.  I've even had programmers offering me  a 
share of their game's royalties, with the amount of work I've put 
in. I've refused, of course (I may be rather short of cash, but I 
can  appreciate  that  nobody deserves royalties  more  than  the 
programmer).

     Taking  an example - and I'm sure Harvey Reall won't mind  - 
Antroids  is  one of the games that's seen a lot  of  involvement 
from  myself.  Way  back  in the mists  of  time,  shortly  after 
Genocide's  release and my consequent casting out from Budgie  (a 
long story,  explained in another document  somewhere),  Caroline 
Price from New Age PDL contacted me regarding "Mega Ants", a life 
simulation from Harvey Reall.  Harvey had sent it to Caroline for 
possible  inclusion in her Creative Influence range,  and  -  for 
some reason - she turned it down,  passing Harvey's address and a 
copy of his game on to me.

     At that time, "Mega Ants" wasn't much to behold. Some little 
dots wandering around biting bits out of green circles.  The user 
interface was a mite hostile (Harvey has since admitted this,  by 
the way - this isn't getting at him at all),  and Harvey  planned 
to release it as Shareware. Until I contacted him.

     I saw that the program had potential.  It didn't look  much, 
but I could see that - with a bit of work - it could develop into 
something  muchly better.  DNA programming things  (the  software 
lets  you write "programs" for the ants to follow,  telling  them 
how  to  move,  when  to mate,  and so on) were rare  on  the  ST 
licenceware scene,  and if the program were developed further  it 
could do well.  "Sprites instead of circles," I suggested, "Sound 
effects if you've got the memory."

     Harvey  took heed.  Nice graphics were added,  foolish  spot 
effects,  and the lad spent a year and a bit refining the program 
to make it a great deal better.  It was speeded up a  lot.  Extra 
DNA  commands were added.  Pre-drawn maps could be used,  and  an 
"art package" map designer was added.  Population graphs could be 
produced.  I started work on a loading screen,  and (via the  OCL 
network  of contacts),  we found someone to write a MOD  for  the 
intro screen. "Antroids", as the game is now called, is a hundred 
times  better  than  the version Harvey  planned  to  release  as 
Shareware  all  those months ago -  he'll be getting a  lot  more 
money  from it,  and the customers will be getting a  great  deal 
more enjoyment from it.

     I'm rambling, here. Best wrap up, I think.

     In conclusion,  OCL is dedicated to the programmers'  needs; 
it's the epitome of truthness when we say that programs turn  out 
best if they're something of a team effort.  If you're writing  a 
platform  game  and  you're struggling over some  aspect  of  the 
coding,  we'll  put you in touch with an OCL member who can  help 
you  out.  Even  if you just fancy writing a  text  adventure  or 
something,  where  you've got the ideas but could do with  a  few 
pointers  on what to write it in and how to do it - we'd  contact 
one of our numbers to give you a hand.

     We've  got a network of peripheral entities also - folk  who 
haven't  actually  written  anything,  but are  always  happy  to 
contribute music and graphics to OCL titles. If you fancy joining 
this group,  feel free - the cash you get is negotiable with  the 
programmer you're "working for",  really;  you could argue for  a 
royalty cut,  settle for a one-off payment, or ask the programmer 
to  put your address in the game and ask folk to send you  money. 
I've  recently thrown a tenner at Chris Pritchett for  writing  a 
couple  of MOD tunes for my forthcoming releases - a  good  thing 
for both of us,  as the inclusion of a musical intro to a game is 
likely to boost sales.  And I've also put an advert in both games 
for some more of Chris's music,  which he's selling himself for a 
few quid - so he'll see some interest there.

     Even if you're terrible at computer graphics, can't code and 
are  as  musically inclined as The Wurzels,  you could  join  our 
ranks  as a playtester (all our releases are playtested to  death 
before  release,  and  all testers get a credit in  the  finished 
game) (as well as the dubious honour of being able to play a game 
months  before  its  release),  contribute to ST  Beermat  -  our 
erratically-released disk magazine,  or team up with a programmer 
with you providing ideas.

                         OCL001- Dead or Alive...?

     Written by: Kev Davis                   Released: 13/5/1992
     Category: Text adventure                Drive requirements: D/S
     Memory requirements: 1/2 Meg            Version number: 2.0

                               Price - œ3.00
      
           Just  when  you thought your life as  a  private  detective 
     couldn't get any worse...  it ended. Rather messily. Being rudely 
     awoken  from the dead the next morning is only the first of  your 
     many  problems as you trek around the town of Malton and  venture 
     beyond to kill your assassin in Kev Davis's highly acclaimed  and 
     bloody difficult comedy adventure. Recommended for both beginners 
     and hardened adventuring veterans alike.

          This is the concentrated,  fat-digesting, cool-tasting, non-
     bleaching,  thirst-quenching,  low-alcohol,  seventy-two calorie, 
     best-ever chocolate, tartare-scraping, eco-bagged, realistically-
     MIG-sound-effected,  interactive fiction version of the game, the 
     few bugs lurking in the old version have been killed - dead.

          Dead  will run on single-sided drives,  but you'll  need  to 
     find a double-sided drive in order to transfer the relevant files 
     onto two disks (instructions on disk).

          (Note:  Dead  was sold by Budgie UK from September 91  until 
     April  92.  If you've got that version (with the lovely  "packing 
     crate falling out of a rockfall and nailing itself to the  floor" 
     bug intact), you're perfectly entitled to send the disk to OCL HQ 
     and claim an update.)


           "Very tongue in cheek.  I ended up revelling in  its  sheer 
     silliness.  If  you enjoy a good laugh then look no further  than 
     Dead or Alive...?" - Neil Shipman, Syntax Magazine (preview).

          "An  excellent example of what a good adventure  should  be. 
     Loads of puzzles, great responses, good parsing, many jokes and a 
     very polished front end. It plays almost like an Infocom game. If 
     you  are  an  adventure  player then  get  this  game!"  -  Colin 
     Campbell, Syntax Magazine (88%)

          "Weird!  Have  a  look if you fancy a little bit more  of  a 
     challenge."  - Chicken (apparently),  ST Action (who  don't  give 
     percentages, for reasons known only to themselves)

          "An atmospheric text adventure... The author's surreal sense 
     of  humour pervades every aspect of the game from  the  sarcastic 
     comments  you  get  from  the  parser  to  some  dowright   silly 
     situations. If you thought text adventures were dull, get Dead or 
     Alive and you may be forced to change your mind... Take a walk on 
     the wild side and pop down to the local graveyard." - Somone, STF 
     (83%)      

          "As text adventures go,  Dead or Alive is a good one...  The 
     difficulty  is  quite high,  but things get far easier  once  you 
     begin  to  appreciate  the  author's  twisted  sense  of  humour! 
     Numerous nice touches." - Nial Grimes, ST Review (four stars)

          "A  decent adventure.  Cute footnotes." - Matthew  Robinson, 
     Shareware and PD Shopper (five stars - maximum)

           (Cute???!)



                    OCL002- Murder on the Orion Express

     Written by: Kev Davis                   Released: 13/4/1993
     Category: Comedy-murder-strategy        Drive requirements: D/S
     Memory requirements: 1/2 Meg            Current version: 666

                               Price - œ3.00

           The  world's  first  ever  comedy-murder  graphically-based 
     mousie-driven  game.  Dare  you take on the role of  a  detective 
     aboard  the Orion Express?  When all but eight of the  passengers 
     die simultaneously,  and the crew are gradually bumped off as the 
     night progresses,  it's your job to sort things out.  Armed  only 
     with  an electronic notebook,  you must trudge around  the  ship, 
     interrogate the people on board and use your skill and  judgement 
     to  work  out  "whodunnit"  (and other  tired  clich‚s)  in  this 
     bizarrely humorous "Cluedo-meets-2001-meets-Red Dwarf-meets-Hitch 
     Hiker's-meets-Monty  Python" as I used to say before I found  out 
     about copyright laws.

          Orion  has  a  free  five-thousand-odd  word   comedy-sci-fi 
     novella  thrown  in just for the hell of it,  centring  around  a 
     series of unwieldy events aboard the Express.

          The  game  -will- run from S/S drives - you've just  got  to 
     delete  everything except the PRG file and the game  data  files, 
     and copy it over to a S/S disk.  Easy as three point one four one 
     five nine two seven something.

          [The  words  "interactive fiction" haven't been  applied  to 
     this blurb,  since the phrase applies to every computer game ever 
     written.]


          "If  you're a Cluedo fan,  be sure to get hold of Murder  on 
     the Orion Express - it's better acted than the TV programme and a 
     lot  more  challenging  than the board  game!  There's  a  strong 
     thread  of humour running through the game and it's very  much  a 
     parody of more serious commercial software.  If you enjoy a  good 
     laugh,  Orion comes recommended." - Nial Grimes,  ST Review (four 
     stars)

          "It's  basically one big logic puzzle...  It's well  screwed 
     together  and  there are plenty of humorous  touches  to  lighten 
     things up." - Someone, STF (75%)


          We've  had some interest regarding the Orion T-shirts  -  if 
     anyone  else  wants  to  put their name down  for  one  of  these 
     exclusive   garments  (featuring  the  Orion  logo  on  a   black 
     background),  contact OCL HQ and we'll get back to you.  Send  no 
     money now.  These articles are not available in the shops. And so 
     on.

                           OCL003 - Sprite Works

     Written by: Terry King                  Released: 7/10/1993
     Category: GFA Extension / Art Package   Drive requirements: D/S
     Memory requirements: 1/2 Meg            Current version: 1.22

                               Price - œ7.00


          Sprite Works is a powerful new set of commands available for 
     GFA Basic - Versions 3 and above.  Essentially for games writers, 
     the  kit  also provides a professional edge to  any  program.  It 
     turns GFA into a games language that can produce results that can 
     equal  and  possibly better those managed through  STOS.  38  new 
     commands  are  provided,  as well as a superb  art  package  that 
     allows easy sprite design, and two map designers.

          Extra GFA commands include:-          * Fast  sprites -
      16x and 32x  widths with  a  variable 
                    height  up  to  48  pixels,   sprite  handler  and 
                    variable clipping
               * Low processor time sample player - 2.5-15 KHz
               * Multi-directional and vertical scrolling maps
               * Non-scrolling, multi-screen maps
               * New fonts - 20, 40 and 64-column widths
               * Program speed regulator
               * Depacker for ICE and AUTOMATION packers
               * Mirror copy
               * Fast screen clear and copy
               * Fast screen line copy
               * New mouse controller
               * Palette switching (32 colours on-screen)
               * Banner scrolling (with an option for running them  on 
                    interrupt whilst disk accessing or something)
               * Degas Elite compressor and decompressor
               * Spectrum 512 displayer

          Also  a must for any budding assembly programmers,  as  full 
     68000 assembly source for all the commands is included.

          The art package includes six fast zooms,  full-screen  real-
     time zoom, animation preview, an option to save sprites in ready-
     to-use  format,  controllable splines and polygons,  loading  and 
     saving in numerous formats,  and has fast  resizing,  recolouring 
     and block rotation. Half meg and full meg versions are included.

          Two map designers come with the package, one for flip-screen 
     maps and one for non-scrolling maps.  Each are fully featured and 
     allow  the  easy  use of "flags" for each  screen  block  to  aid 
     collision detection.

          Sprite Works comes on two disks, with full documentation and 
     annotated GFA examples of the commands, as well as GFA source for 
     the  three  games  and the two demo programs given  away  on  the 
     Freebie disk.


          "You  will not believe the quality of the games that can  be 
     produced  with Sprite Works - the platform game demo  runs  every 
     bit  as smoothly as Magic Pockets!  It's probably a bit  advanced 
     for the casual programmer,  but is ideal for the seasoned GFA fan 
     in  seach  of a bit more power.  One of the  best  things  that's 
     happened to GFA Basic in a long time" - ST Review (five stars)



                   OCL004 - The Ultimate Cheat Database

     You  know the feeling.  After a fearsome hour battling  with  the 
     fifth  end-of-level nasty on Cynic the Bullfrog III,  you  decide 
     that  enough  is  enough,  and  elect  to  start  cheating.  This 
     invariably  means  searching through a billion ST  magazine  back 
     issues  in  search  of a cheat,  which  can  get  quite  horribly 
     annoying after a while.

          The UCD solves that problem at a stroke.  It's simplicity to 
     use - page through the list of cheats until you find the title of 
     the  game  that's troubling you,  click on the  blighter and  you 
     can either scribble down or print out the text of it.

          At  the  time of writing there are well  over  four  hundred 
     cheats  in the UCD,  and we're constantly updating  and  refining 
     them  (customers  are invited to send in any cheats  they've  got 
     that  aren't  in  the  database  already,   so  it'll  always  be 
     expanding) - you can claim a free update whenever you want.

          Note  for 1/2 meggers - the UCD program itself  bursts  into 
     flames  on  a 520,  I'm afraid,  so you'll have to use  the  less 
     advanced displayer program (you can still print cheats  out,  and 
     everything,  but  you  don't get the foppishness  of  the  proper 
     version). Such is life.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------
          Before spending your hard-earned/stolen wealth on one of the
     OCL  titles,  you  might  like  to  get  hold  of  a  nearly-free 
     demonstration disk, to give you some idea what you'll be buying. 

          Freebie  bundles  are only available from  OCL  Headquarters 
     itself,  or from the software's programmer - all addresses are in 
     the  OCLADDRS.DOC  somewhere.  Please enclose a blank  disk  when 
     writing for a Freebie - if we gave out disks to anyone who wanted 
     them,  we'd  soon  run  out of money.  And whilst  an  SAE  isn't 
     entirely essential, you'll get a far swifter reply than you would 
     get without one. 

          It's possible to get more than one Freebie bundle on a disk, 
     so if one of our authors is offering two Freebies that'll fit  on 
     the  same  disk,  you can  request  both.  And,  of  course,  OCL 
     Headquarters can offer you a blend of any Freebies you like.

          Oh - mention if you want a double or single-sided  disk,  by 
     the way. Just to be sure.


     FREEBIE001 - Sprite Works (331k)

          This  bundle contains two rather swish demos (both coded  in 
     GFA with bits from Sprite Works) and three demo games - an  8-way 
     scrolling platform game, a flip-screen platform and an above-view 
     driving game;  all are coded in GFA with the aid of Sprite Works, 
     and  give an inspiring example of what you can achieve using  the 
     package.
          A  cut-down version of the Sprite Works art package is  also 
     included. Blimey.


     -----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  UPDATES


          If  you  own  an  earlier version  of  a  game  that's  been 
     mentioned  above,  you  can  claim a completely  free  update  by 
     sending your *original* game disk to the programmer,  ensuring to 
     enclose an SAE (or an SSAE, or whatever you call it - an envelope 
     with your address and an adequate stamp on it,  anyway).  Oh, and 
     the  OCL  programmers  reserve the right to keep  your  disk  and 
     ignore  you  completely  if  you  send  them  an  old  relabelled 
     coverdisk that you swear blind is an original,  or if you neglect 
     to forward an SAE.

          The version numbers for some games are a trifle odd,  and  I 
     think Colin Campbell was having a go at me for this a while back. 
     Despite all this, the version numbers do go up in ascending order 
     with  their  rerelease,  so  it's safe  to  assume  that  version 
     146657.372  is a later and consequently more wonderful  one  than 
     version 19+(52cos20)ý. But it shouldn't ever get that bad.

               Dead or Alive Too...? - Not Dead but Sleeping
                               By Kev Davis

                Expected date of release: Mid-1994. Honest.

          Waking up on the back of a lorry on its way to an  Icelandic 
     burger factory is not the best way to start the day. Neither, for 
     James Milton - proprietor of Milton's Chipporama,  is being  shot 
     by an armed robber. And as for the Egyptian king, Ptedious, after 
     three   thousand  years  trapped  in  a  freezing   mountainside, 
     virtually anything could be better.
          Dead  Too  takes place five years after the end of  Dead  or 
     Alive,  and  includes  the  option to switch  between  the  three 
     undeads  at will.  Prepare to do battle  with  Weresheep,  cereal 
     killers, psychopath robots, vengeful octopi, possessed electrical 
     goods,   suicidal  gargoyles,   demons  on  the  housing  estate, 
     cablecar-riding Nihilist monks,  interplanetary  buses,  chickens 
     and  billions more things in this stunningly brilliant  (Footnote 
     3) text adventure. Death has never been so much fun.


                                    Antroids
                                By Harvey Reall

                Expected date of release: Somewhen in 1994

          Hours  of endless fascination as you tinker about  with  the 
     DNA programs of insects,  before letting them loose on the  world 
     to build their colony.
          Antroids  is one of the most absorbing life  simulations  to 
     date. There are limitless possibilities for the game set-up - two 
     ant colonies battling against each other for survival,  a team of 
     cannibal  ants  descending  on  helpless  workers,  a  two-player 
     challenge to create the perfect ant,  or even just initialising a 
     colony and watching it grow. The game features a dazzling variety 
     of  features  to  make  your enjoyment  of  the  simulation  even 
     greater, as well as sampled sound and superb graphics. If you can 
     bear the sleepless nights, then buy this game.


                                ST Beermat
                    Programmed and Edited by Kev Davis

               Expected date of release: Whenever we've got
                            enough stuff for it

          We  still  need a goodly number of articles and  things  for 
     this.  If you fancy writing anything for this, send your stuff in 
     ASCII format to me at the usual address. Any subject or style you 
     want - quality is our only aim.

          None  of  that foolish "see  how  many  swearwords,  obscene 
     references  and  exclamation  marks  we  can  get  per  sentence" 
     attitude favoured by other disk mags, thanks all the same.


                    Mission Implausible II - The Metal Lurgy
                                  By Kev Davis

                      Expected date of release: Early 1994

          Set  in the latter half of the 24th century,  Mish Two  sees 
     the  crew  of  the Drunken Sailor caught up in  the  Metal  Lurgy 
     outbreak in the city of Malton.  When the ship's android co-pilot 
     takes another crewmember hostage,  it's your job to beam down and 
     sort things out.
          Mish Two uses the rather swish Perpetual Reality Engine -  a 
     graphic-adventure system requiring the minimum of keyboard input. 
     Presented with a graphic screen,  you click on an object to bring 
     up a list of relevant verbs, from which you choose one that takes 
     your fancy. Couldn't be simpler.
          Note  that "Mission Implausible - Involuntary Suicide"  -  a 
     rather  nice  adventure  using a  Kev-written  version  of  Simes 
     Brown's  "Stone  Cold  Sober"  system,  will  probably  never  be 
     released  because I got completely carried away with it  all  and 
     ran out of memory. Such is life.


                        Escape from the Dungeons of Trax
                                 By Robin Ball

                       Expected release date: Early 1994?

          An  extremely  impressive  game,   utilising  the  Perpetual 
     Reality  Engine.  Stunning visuals and a wicked sense  of  humour 
     combine to form a superb graphic adventure.  The plot for this is 
     all  a bit up in the air at the moment,  but it's fairly safe  to 
     assume  that  Escaping from the Dungeons of Trax  comes  into  it 
     somewhere.

                                 Strana Mechty
                          By Kev Davis and Simon Brown

                          Expected release date: 1994?

          This game's been undergoing severe rethinking,  and we're on 
     the fourth version at the moment.  We're trying to make a comedy-
     RPG  sort  of thing,  but it could end up  as  dayglo  underwater 
     space-invaders  at  the  rate we're scrapping  ideas.  We  had  a 
     Dungeon  Master layout a while back,  but we've ditched  that  in 
     favour of an above-view approach. For the moment.

                     LIES, DAMN LIES AND RELEASE DATES


          Although   the  release  dates  stated  above  are   vaguely 
     accurate,  we  can't promise anything.  We live in  an  uncertain 
     world,  where nothing is for definite, and it's quite likely that 
     some games will take a while to appear.

          There's  not a lot I can do about this,  as I don't like  to 
     pressurise  people  into  a  quick  release  (anyone  who  bought 
     Genocide on its day of release will have seen what this can  lead 
     to).  However, if you desperately want to see Antroids out by the 
     end  of the year,  or if Trax sounds like something you'd  really 
     like  to  see - contact the  programmer  (via  myself,  probably) 
     saying how much you'd like to see their product  completed.  This 
     sort  of  ego-boosting does wonders for bringing  forward  actual 
     release dates.
