I mailled Darryl Still at Atari UK about the release of Llamazap, and
other related stuff on unreleased software (TOS5, etc) and here's what
he had to say.....or someone at atari had to say anyway (no-one put a
name at the bottom of the message, so it could have been anyone there).

So - Llamazap gets a release at FES (finally).
But I still think the reply is laden with bad attitude towards me and
other disgruntled falcon owners (esp. the bits about TOS 5).
