================================================================
0)  Who am I and why do you care?


   Well, perhaps you don't care.  But anyway, I have always been a big
Atari nut.  In my earlier youth (I am only 22.83 now) I was known for being
able to tell you the product number of any given piece of Atari (non ST)
hardware.  I also held the high score on the then many Atari bbs's for
being able to list off memory locations within the 8bit computer OS.
So, I took all this as a sign to go to college and get a degree in 
Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.  

  This is my 5th year at the wonderful Penn (pepsi) State University.
I will be graduating in May, thank God.  All the work that was done
on this Faq was done at the expense of other class work.  Well, okay,
I like saying that, but actually I probably would have found something
else that was non-academic to take up my time.  However, 
I decided to stay in my dorm room and finish this up for my
fellow collectors.  That is one of the advantages of having my own 
Unix box on the internet . . . hehehe)

  A while ago I found a Classic Atari Game System Faq from 1992.  The      
project seemed to have fallen apart and I knew that it would be hard
to actually get a communal effort together to work on this thing so I
took up the task myself, of course, with the help of contributions from
the internet.  This is my first big contribution to the world of
classic systems.  (My second, I hope, is going to be a wonderful software
package for collectors... maybe I'll work on that over xmas.)

  I hope this FAQ helps someone....


==========================================================
1.1) What NetNews groups exist for the CAGS?

   Currently there are the following netnews groups with various information
 pertaining to the 26/52/78 systems:

   alt.atari.2600vcs (and its various other clones, .2600 and .2600.vcs)
   alt.games.video.classic
   rec.games.video.classic
   rec.games.video.marketplace  (to buy things of course!)


==========================================================
1.2) What Atari 2600/5200/7800 games list exist?

  There are several game lists available.  Games are listed by manufacturer
or by game title;  some have rarity codes, others have prices.  The two
most widely used lists by collectors are listed here:

1)  VGR (Craig Pell) maintains a gigantic listing of every known game
    cartridge produced for the Atari 2600 or 7800.  The list contains the
    game's name and manufacturer's model number.  Games are grouped together
    by the cartridge manufacture and then by product number. 

    To receive a copy of the latest game listing, or to suggest a change or
    update to the list, send e-mail to VGR at vgriscep@wam.umd.edu.

2)  The most "generic" list of games, and perhaps the most easy to use
    are maintained by Dean Dierschow (dean@xocolatl.com).  Current lists
    are available from wiretap.spies.com under /game_archive/cartList.
    Games are grouped together by manufacture and then by alphabetical
    title.

    Entries   File Name      System                               Date

    You will also need the file "carts.lst" for important information.

    Dean also has lists for just about every other system in existence.

3)  "The Giant List of 2600 Label Variations" is the list for all of
    us "sick" collectors who need to tell exactly what carts we own.
    This list goes into detail.  Here is an excerpt:

    Cosmic Ark                 IA3204            
        silver label with no picture, "for use with..." in 5 languages
        silver label with picture 720104-1 Rev A.  1982 entirely to the         
   
                right of the picture.
        silver label with picture 720104-1 Rev A.  right edge of picture    
                is in the middle of 1982.

  It is a bi-monthly Atari 2600 collector fanzine published by
Tim Duarte. The 2600 Connection is an excellent source of
information about Atari video game collecting in general, including
news, game reviews, interviews, and entertaining anecdotes.
Rare and collectible games are frequently discussed.  Classified
ads in the Connection are relevant to all Atari game machines.
Subscription price is $6 for a year's worth of bi-monthly issues.

1.5) In the news....

-----
Famous Brand Electronics Outlet in Woodbury, MN, has a large supply
of *new* 7800s, along with a box of 40 *unopened* games, for $70.
I talked with a clerk there on Monday, and he said that they *will*
ship to people from the Internet, provided they have valid credit cards,
etc.  Note that not all the games are 7800 games. 

The phone number for Famous Brand Electronics is (612) - 730-7375.
Tell them Greg sent you.

 systems remain...  Someone should tell this guy to obtain more...
 LOTS more. =)  I have yet to purchase a set, nor will I probably
 get a change to. 8~( ]

 
------
Datamation magazine (Oct 15, 94) is reporting that Activision plans to release 
2 compilations of Atari 2600 games for Windows, on floppy or cdrom.  Feb 1995
is the release date for the first compilation, which will include Pitfall!,
Kaboom!, River Raid and Chopper Command.

Hey?  Whats going on with the PC version of Adventure?


==========================================================
2.1) Where can I find games for my 2600/5200/7800?

      There are still several sources for new game cartridges.
Mail order firms such as Telegames USA and Best Electronics  are
probably the best source for new games. They still stock many
different games cartridges for all the Atari game machines.  Many
titles they carry are extremely rare and collectible.  Although
some of the rarer titles in their inventories are dwindling, they
seem to have good stock of many others. 

      Occasionally some retail stores will still have Atari
cartridges in stock, although sometimes they are hidden in the
backroom. One good places to look is toy stores who used to carry
the Atari, such as Toys 'R Us, Kaybee Toys (formerly Circus 
World), and Children's Palace (now in bankruptcy).  Another good
source is discount liquidator stores, such as Toy Liquidators,
Big Lots/Odd Lots, and Sears Outlets.  These stores typically have huge
quantities of a limited number of titles, but their discounts are the
greatest.

      Another excellent source for rare and collectible games is
the classified ads in The 2600 Connection. The Usenet newsgroups
are another place to find new and used game cartridges. There are
frequent postings to both rec.games.video and misc.forsale by
individuals who have Atari game cartridges for sale.  You might
also find a rare Atari want-ad in a local newspapers or
pennysaver.  A better source would likely be the want ads  of a
local Atari computer user's group newsletter.

     Finally, there are the many good 2600 games and systems
waiting to be liberated from flea markets, thrift stores, and
yard sales around the country. Few people will advertise that
they have Atari games for sale, but if you get out and look
around, you'll find them.  If you relish the thought of finding
"a diamond in a dumpster" and you've always liked treasure
hunting, you may enjoy rumaging through piles of junk to fill
those elusive gaps in your game list at minimal cost.

  Also, you may now special order shrinkwrapped Atari 2600 games from
Radio Shack.  As I understand it, Atari themselves still have some for
sale.        [Anybody got a list of what they have and how much?]


  Best Electronics has several games and parts for the classic
systems:

2.2) What are the best games for the 2600?

This can be a subjective matter, of course, but Mike Littau conducted
an informal 2600 games poll on r.g.v. a few years ago, trying to find
answer this very question.  Here are the results, with some slight
changes in format:

------------------------------------------
In addition, The 2600 Connection ran an article on the 2600
cartridge "Hall of Fame", listing the best classic 2600 games. There
was an excellent capsule description of each game.  Here is the list:

The 2600 Connection Cartridge Hall of Fame (from issue #10:

Combat                  Asteroids                    Honorable Mention:
Super Breakout          Centipede (and Millipede)    Draggonfire
Defender                Donkey Kong (and Jr.)        Demon Attack
Adventure               Mario Bros.                  Megamania
Space Invaders          Pitfall! (and II)            HERO

Solaris                 Q*Bert


==========================================================
2.3) What are the most common and rarest games?

The following lists are a quick compilation of what some collectors would
consider to be the most common and rarest 2600 games.  Neither list is
exhaustive, they are simply provided as as quick reference.

Those games that are NOT listed as rare are not necessarily common, and
vice versa.  Many, many, games fall into the "hard to track down" catagory.

The following lists ARE contraversial.  Even combat is depending
on what type of label it has.

It is in the readers best interest to obtain VGR's list and run
the following commands on it from a unix machine:

grep ' xx ' filename > xx.lst

Where 'filename' is the name of VGR's list and 'xx' is ER, R, U, C.
xx.lst will then contain the output of this extraction.

2.5) What is this Starpath CD I keep hearing about?

  Currently there is a project that involves putting all the 
Starpath SuperCharger audio tapes onto a CD.  The author is looking
for un-released games and PAL versions.  Check out the 2600
news groups for update information.


==========================================================
2.6) What Easter Eggs (cheats) exist for the 26/52/7800?

   This section has grown rather large and a new version 
of the cheats faq is available EMAIL from Galen Tatsuo Komatsu.
The current list size is about 30k.  The previous one posted
in the FAQ was about 6k.

Request "Send B-TECH" from:

gkomatsu@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu
ar592@cleveland.freenet.edu


================================================================
2.7.1) What out there exists to help programmers?

  For 2600 users there is the "Stella" guide.  It is availabe
from the FTP sites mentioned in this list.  Atari.archive.umich.edu
has a modified version of Stella that is postscript format with
graphs and diagrams.

  For the 7800 there is Harry Dodgson's (dodgson@coyote.cs.umich.edu)
Monitor Cart plus documentation.  The 250+ pages include a stella guide,
a 2600 programming manual which is a bit more readable, the Maria specs,
and the 7800 docs.


================================================================
2.7.2) What is the 7800 encryption algorithm?

   The 7800 uses a data encryption key to determine whether or not the
7800 cartridge is valid and allows the system to be put in 7800 mode
as opposed to 2600 mode.  The encryption algorithm is said to be
proprietary.  Rumors exist, however,  that Atari released the algorithm
for use on the the Atari ST series of computers.  If anybody has this
program we would all be very happy to have a look at it.  It is also
rumored that not many people at Atari know what the algorithm is or
how to use it anymore.

   It is now also rumored that it was released for the Lynx Dev-Kit
for the Amiga's.  Rumors...rumors....


================================================================
2.8)  Bugs.

   This section deals with major software/hardware bugs.
   Anybody know of some more?


================================================================
2.8.1) Whats up with 7800 Impossible Mission?

  7800 Impossible mission REALLY is impossible.
  The cart was released with a bug where some of the pieces you need
  were hidden under computer terminals...YOU CAN'T SEARCH THE TERMINALS.
  This bug was fixed, but I don't think Atari ever released the updated
  version.

3.1) What different 26/52/7800 models and accessories did Atari make?

Some people not only collect game cartridges, but hardware systems as
well.  Here is some basic information on the various game systems that
Atari has made over the years.


================================================================
3.1.1) Atari 2600 and Sears Video Arcade Systems

Atari VCS CX2600 - Original model. Woodgrain and black plastic enclosure.
        Six silver switches across the upper front panel.   Bundled
        accessories include two CX40 joysticks,  one CX30 paddle controller,
        AC adapter, TV switch and a CX2601 Combat game cart.
        Sample wording on label on bottom of unit:
        "Mfd. by Atari, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA.  Serial # 048181."
        "Mfd. by Atari-Wong Ltd. in Hong Kong.  Serial # 568213514."

Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade I - Same as above except external cosmetic
        differences (the "difficulty" switches  are labeled "skill level",
        switch panel is silver instead of black, woodgrain pattern is
        different.)
        Sample wording on label on bottom of unit:
        "Mfd. for Atari Inc. by Dimerco Electronics in Taiwan for sale to
        Sears, Roebuck, and Co.  Serial # 82077230."

Atari VCS 2600A - Revised model.  Externally it is nearly identical to the
        original, except there are four silver switches across the upper front
        panel instead of six.   Internally, the motherboard is a simplified
        one-piece design.
        Sample wording on label on bottom of unit:
        "Mfd. for Atari, Inc. by TRW Electronic Components Co. in Taiwan.
        Serial # 811510200."
        "Mfd. for Atari, Inc. by Atari Taiwan Mfing. Corp. in Taiwan.
        Serial # 827030354."

Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade I(A) - Same as above except external cosmetic
        differences.
        Sample wording on label on bottom of unit:
        "Mfd. for Atari Inc. by Dimerco Electronics in Taiwan for sale to
        Sears, Roebuck, and Co.  Serial # 82299647."

Atari VCS 2600A (black) - Second revised model. Externally it is nearly
        identical to the 2600A, except the enclosure has a more modern
        looking "black out" treatment.  The areas of woodgrain on the original
        models are now simply black plastic.  Internally, the motherboard is a
        mild revision of the 2600A.
        Sample wording on label on bottom of unit:
        "Mfd. for Atari, Inc. by Atari Taiwan Mfing. Corp. in Taiwan.
        Serial # AT831150153."

Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade II - Entirely new model of the 2600 designed
        just for Sears. Black wedge-shaped enclosure, with push button
        switches and LEDs on top panel. Essentially an Atari 7800 shell.
        Four joystick connectors on lower front panel with rocker switch.
        Internally very different from other 2600 models, but
        still uses the same basic chipset.  Bundled accesories include two
        combination joystick/paddle controllers, AC adapter, TV switch
        and a Space Invaders game cart.
        Sample wording on label on bottom of unit:
        "Sears, Inc. (Atari, Inc.) Serial # SV 392 005539."

Atari 2600 "Jr." - Third revised model.  Slighlty bigger than a VHS video
        tape case.  Push and slide button switches.  Jet black with large
        metallic silver strip running lengthwise with "Atari 2600" on it.
        Known as the "Under 50 bux, the fun is back!" machine.
        Bundled accessories include one joystick, AC adapter, TV switch box,
        and RCA connecting cable.  Box is designed as a carrying case with
        handle and a white section which reads: "This Atari 2600 belongs to:"
        No bundled cart.

Atari 2600 "Jr." - same as above except silver plate has a larger rainbow
        strip without an embossed border.

All 6 switch Ataris had a large shield casing.  There were at least
two 6-switch versions:
 
(6-1) The original. The entire bottom half of the console was made of
      quarter inch thick plastic (~6mm)! Combined with the thick
      aluminum RF casing, this is the heaviest 2600 ever made. Also,
      this 2600 has no 2/3 channel select switch. The hole in there on
      the case and it's marked Channel A/B, but there's no switch inside
      on the PCB. These consoles came with "01 combat". (1977 models only)
 
(6-2) The lighter 2600.  No armor plating.  Bottom half of console is made 
      of thin plastic, like the 4 switch models. Channel switch now present.
      Thick RF shield still present. Plain ol' "combat" included.

4 front switch, woodgrain panel:

Among these are some minor, minor differences. On some, the difficulty
switches are marked "Expert/Novice" (or was it "Advanced/Beginner"?) and
others are marked only as "A/B". Rumors persist that the pictures on the
packaging was different. Pac-Man was the pack-in cart later on. Also, if
you really want to get picky, some 2600s were made in Taiwan, some in Hong
Kong, some in Sunnyvale, (anything else). I've got to go through my
duplicate 2600s and match all these variations up with the revision numbers
(A, B, C, D, etc.).

Also, were there color variations in the lettering, the the borderline
around the switches, and cart slot? I have yellow ones and orange ones
or is this just fading?

         on shell.

         Some versions will play more 2600 games than the other.  Please
         note that this incompatability problem only shows up on one or
         two 2600 cartridges out of the 1000 or so made;  most notably
         Activision's "Robot Tank."

From: Krishna@tiac.net (Glenn Saunders)

        The very first 7800s which hit the market (I believe) were the
ones originally manufactured years earlier in the tail end of the Warner
Atari ownership.  The box on my 7800 vaunts the expansion interface which
would be used akin to the XEGS to make it into a REAL computer.  One of
the reasons I bought the 7800 was on the odd chance that something like
that would surface although I already owned an Atari 8-bit home
computer.  I could tell from the box that it was old because I think it
still had the Warner copyright on it.

        The 7800 was designed as the true successor to the 2600.  The
5200 was a diversion and a waste of time for the most part, duplicating
what the home computer line was doing.  Atari dropped the ball by not
releasing the 7800 when it was finished, in the can, and units all ready
to go.  When Tramiel took over and saw that Nintendo had revived the
computer industry with its 6502 based 8-bit NES, he decided to get back
into the game world and dusted off the 7800.  If you notice the copyright
dates on the early games they all say 1984 on them but the unit itself
was not released until at least late 86 if not 87.  By this time Nintendo
had established itself as the leader of the newborn video game industry
and Atari's 2600 and 7800 were left to rot off the shelves for a few more
years.  The 7800, however, had the capability to compete with the NES had
it been developed for with the vigor of Nintendo during the video game
rebuilding process of 84-86.

        The 7800 has a true operating system and a DOS/BASIC was
developed for it.  It has I think 16K RAM inside and the expansion port
could I guess be a serial I/O port.  But Warners had big plans for the
computer end of the 7800.  They knew they really couldn't make the
"Graduate" keyboard add-on for the 2600.  The 2600s limited 6507
processor just made memory management a royal pain in the ass.  The 7800
uses the same processor as the Atari XL/XEs and thus would have made a
pretty good computer.

==========================================================
3.4) What light guns work with the 2600/7800?

 There is no light-gun made specifically for the 2600 or 7800, however,
 Atari's light gun (model number XG-1) that came with the XE-Game-System
 works well. 

 Additionally, Best Electronics has "The Best Lightgun" which
 works better than Atari's own.

 Antic Magazine  published an article on how to convert a sega
 master system light gun for use on the Atari's.

 From Antic Magazine, August 1988, Vol. 7, num. 4
     "First look: Inside the XE Game System: Hardware surprises revealed!"
     by Matthew Ratcliff
     page 45

   To modify the Sega gun for the Atari, you'll have to cut off
the incompatible connector. The wires must be stripped back and soldered
into an Atari joystick connector as follows:

        SEGA GUN                    ATARI JOYSTICK PORT
        Blue wire                   Pin 1 stick FWD
        Gray wire                   Pin 6 trigger
        Green wire                  Pin 7  +5 volts
        Black wire                  Pin 8 Ground

   Because of the close fitting connections for the XEGS ports, 
don't wire in a DB9 female connector that has "ears". Most joysticks
don't have wires for unused signals, so cutting up an old joystick cable
may not work. Specifically, an Atari joystick does not need the +5 volts,
so there isn't likely to be a wire connected to Pin 7. However, you
can find joystick extension cables at Radio Shack, which have all nine
pins wired from male to female. Antic disclaims responsibility for any 
damages that might occur during improper implementation of this, or any,
hardware modification project we publish.

    Once it's all hooked up, you'll notice that gun fires when you release
the trigger, which is annoying. The Sega trigger wiring is the opposite
of what the Atari light gun uses. To rewire the trigger switch, remove the
five screws (one is under the Sega logo on the side). Find the trigger
micro-switch with three connections. Wire to the normally closed contacts
instead of normally open.

3.5)  The following are interfaces to enhance the a base
      system's abilities


==========================================================
3.5.1) What add on modules existed for the 2600?

Compumate - 42 key touchpad computer add on from Spectravideo.  Adds
            16K ROM, 2K RAM, and has BASIC.  Looks like a small keyboard 
            attatched to a cartridge, which is in turn connected to the
            joystick ports.  Originally sold for $79.99

Copy Cart - from Vidco, allowed tranfer of a game onto a blank cartridge. 
            Battery powered, not all games can be copied because of memory
            limitations.

CVC GameLine - Play games via modem to a networked database. 
            See Game Doctor in Electronic Games in early '94.
          
            [Somebody want to scan this in for me?]


Game Selex - from Starplex, allows 9 cartridges to be plugged in at
            once; turn a dial to choose the game.

Kid Vid Control - Cassette recorder and cartridge interface, additional
            wire connects recorder to joystick port.  Voices and songs 
            tell player what to do on screen.  Tape shuts off automatically
            to wait for player input.  3 tapes per game, only games were
            Berenstain Bears and Smurfs Save the Day.  Made by Coleco.

Personal Game Programmer - By Answer, similar to Game Genie.  

ROM Scanner - from Marjac, allows 10 cartridges to be plugged in, 
            press a button to choose game.

Starpath Supercharger - Large cartridge that plugged into the 2600 slot
            had a cable with standard 1/8" jack for plugging into   
            tape recorders.  Games came on regular audio cassettes  
            with previews of upcoming releases.  Added memmory and  
            graphics(?) to the system.  [need tech specs]  

Video Game Brain - from RGA International Limited.  A multiple cartridge
           adapter that holds six games to play, and contains 2 dummy
           slots for additional cart storage.  You select the game
           you want to play by pushing a button in frot of that 
           cartridge. 

Videoplexer - ??  Holds 8 games.  [Need more info]


==========================================================
3.5.2) What add on modules existed for the 5200?

The Masterplay Interface - by Electra Concepts.  Allowed the ability
           to use 2600 controllers with the 5200.  The company
           also released a game called "Meteorites."  I have seen
           pictures of this device in the ORIGINAL Electronic
           Games (or whatever it was called back in 83/84.)
 
           IF ANYBODY HAS ONE OF THESE I WOULD APPRECIATE
           A SCHEMATIC or the ability to tinker with one  
           in order to duplicate one!!



==========================================================
3.6) What are the known specs for the 2600/5200/7800?

The information here is incomplete in some places, misleading in others,
and possibly just wrong in other places.


Specifications for the Atari 2600/7800

3.7.2) 2600 Cartridge Pinouts and information:

The 2600 Cartridge:
        A standard cartridge contains the equivalent of a 2716 or 2732/2532
with one notable exception: the chip select line is active high, not low.
The high order address line of the 6507 (A12) is used as the chip enable.
There was at least one company that used EPROMs with a 74LS04 inverter to
compensate for this.

Note 1: On both of the cartridges I took apart, GND was also connected
        to SGND.  Best to make sure that they are wired together.

Note 2: A11 and A12 could be switched.  On both the chips I've checked,
        A12 was hardwired to +5 volts which leads me to believe that it
        is the highest address line.  Since I believe that these chips
        are only 4Kx8 ROMs, this seems logical, since A12 would actually
        be just the chip enable for ROM (right?).  Only the 2600 info
        tells differently, and it doesn't give any connection for A11 on
        the EPROM, so I don't trust it.  Unfortunately, since the 2716
        EPROM is used as an example, we won't know without actually trying
        one, since the 2716 doesn't really use A11 or A12 and either one
        could be used as a chip enable

 [Is this looking into the jack or the power supply?]

If you are handy with a soldering iron, you can get a more standard jack
and just solder it in parallel with the original connector, then buy a
power supply at Radio Shack for a few bucks.    


==========================================================
4.1) Building a switchbox for the 4 port 5200.

[Heller:  In my own trials of attempting such things I have actually
gotten the 5200 to work by plugging the DC line cord directly into
the RCA cable on the 4port model.  Then, inside, I wire up another RCA
cable to carry the video to a standard 2600 switchbox. THIS OTHER
CABLE PLUGS INTO THE RCA JACK INSIDE THE 5200!! NEVER NEVER NEVER
PLUG the power line into the internal RCA jack nor never plug
the standard 4 port rca cable into a power pack and then into
a 2600 switchbox!! - This mod, however, does not take into account
what havoc is occurring by pumping video signals directly into the
power supply.  I however, just wanted to see if this concept worked.
The 5200 4/2 models are similar inside for what components are used
for video.  It may be quite possible to convert a 4 port into a 
standard 2 port video source and vice versa...]


Where do I hook up the power supply to my 4 port Atari 5200?! 

The early Atari 5200s came with an unusual switchbox which supplied power
to the 5200 down the same wire the 5200 uses to send the video signal to 
your TV. The power supply plugged into the switchbox. Unfortunately, these 
switchboxes seem to have gotten lost over the years and are difficult to
come by. Newer 5200s (the one with only two controller ports) had the
power supply jack on the console itself. Fortunately, it is not difficult
to construct your own RF/power supply box for the 5200. There is one
difference, though. The original 5200 switchbox would automatically switch
from your TV antenna/cable to the 5200 when you turned the console on.
With the RF/power box described below, you will need to use a standard
game/TV switchbox to accomplish this function. 

What do I need to build the RF/Power box? 

The following parts are needed to construct the box. Where applicable, 
Radio Shack part numbers, and prices, have been provided. You may use 
another RCA jack in place of the F jack if you wish. I chose to use the 
F jack to avoid ever accidentally plugging the 5200 and TV cables in
backwards, which would result in 11.5 volts DC going into your TV set,
possibly damaging it.

How do I build it? 

Drill holes in the aluminum box for each jack to match the diagram below.
The box itself forms the common ground connection to all three jacks. 
To reduce signal loss and ensure the common ground, I recommend using 
chrome or gold plated type jacks.

  (to pwr supply)   (to 5200)         Screw the box shut. You're done.

How does it work? 

The capacitor transparently passes the video signal from the 5200 to the 
TV output jack, while at the same time preventing the DC power from the 
power supply jack from going into your TV. The choke (inductor)
transparently passes the the 11.5 volt DC power to the 5200 via the RCA
jack while at the same time preventing the video signal from escaping back
down the power supply wire. The bolt around which the choke is wound helps
to increase the choke's inductance to block more of the video signal from
going back into the power supply than it otherwise would. The aluminum box 
itself helps keep the video signal confined to where it belongs to prevent
possible interference and to ensure that as much of the signal as possible 
gets to your TV. For this reason, plastic boxes are not recommended. 

Power supply info (if you don't have one). 

The 5200 power supply is 11.5 volts DC @ 1.95 amps and has a standard type 
coaxial plug (center positive 5mm OD, 2.1mm ID). Or you could construct
one from a transformer, 4 diodes, two capacitors, a resistor, a 3A adj. 
voltage regulator, heat sink, case, and cabling, or find a 12V 2A power 
supply and add a diode inline to drop the voltage by 0.5V, but that's
another project!

4.2) Composite/audio/chroma/luma output for the Atari 2600 by THOMAS CLANCY

File revision 1.1

After finding my entertainment budget disappear (poor university
student) I was forced to economize--I dusted off the Ole'2600.
I figured I would hook it up to my computer monitor, but to my
dismay there was no composite output on the beast (Atari).
Determined to overcome, I quickly disassembled it. After some
poking and prodding around I managed to locate the required
signals.

Benefits:  No longer require a TV. You no longer require those
           god-awful switch boxes. No more interference patterns
           on the screen (from the RF cable being used as a bloody
           antenna). No longer requires the 100' hookup RF cable.
           Crisp clear audio etc;

Drawbacks: No longer get to see sister trip in 100' RF cable. No
           longer get to fall asleep with psychedelic interference
           patterns on screen. 


Materials Required:
  Phillips screwdriver, a soldering iron, solder, a small piece of
  wire, 2 or 3 patch cables and a small pair of needle-nose pliers.


* The following schematic is for the NEWER model which is sometimes
  referred to as the "Atari Junior".  The older model is much the
  same.


1-Simply unplug everything from your console, turn it over and
  remove the 5 screws.
2-Remove the top and bottom plastic case pieces. When removing the
  TOP piece carefully pull out the ribbon cable that connects it to
  the main board.
3-You should now have the board (covered by a metal shield) in your
  hands. Turn it over, you will see little clasps on the edge of the
  shield that hold it in place. Straighten these with your pliers
  and you can then remove 2 LARGE shields (One on Bottom of unit,
  one on Top). The small shield remaining (On Top) covers the RF
  modulator.
4-Orient the exposed board into the position that it would normally
  be in. ie: The way it is when you play (On/Off switch near Top
  Left).
5-Look in the LOWER RIGHTHAND AREA of the TOPSIDE (front) of the
  board. You will see a setup that resembles the schematic below.

                              __________________

                       R41 (Chroma) ---    --- C19 (Audio)
                       Gold/Red/Grey/Blue      Usually turquoise
                       Color-banded            colored

NOTE: You can connect the Audio to EITHER side of the Capacitor,
      the best results are obtained by placing it on the BOTTOM
      of the Capacitor (as shown).

      The Chroma *MUST* be hooked up to the BOTTOM of the resistor
      (as shown).  It will NOT work if you hook it to the top of
      the resistor.


To gain Chroma/Luma/Audio output you will need 3 RCA patch cables
[the kind commonly used with stereos]. Simply solder the cables at
the required points (Chroma/Luma/Audio) as shown. Remember to GROUND
ALL cables! ie: solder the GROUND wire [the wire that wraps around
the inner wire] to any point that the board shield connects to.

To gain Composite/Audio output you need 2 RCA patch cables [the kind
commonly used with stereos]. Here it gets a little different than
above. Simply solder a "jumper" [a piece of wire] from R41 (Chroma)
to TP5 (Luma), then connect a patch cord to TP5 [Presto! you now have
composite]. Solder the remaining cable to C19 (Audio). Again, remember
to GROUND all cables. Do *NOT* GROUND the jumper!

Simply re-assemble the unit and you are done. You will find that it
is easier to have the newly installed cables exit through the joystick
port. Alternatively, you could cut a notch in the case for a separate
exit. Having the cables exit through the RF output is not recommended.
There will not be enough room (without pinching the cables) to hook up
the RF cable. Adjust your brightness/contrast. Enjoy!

If you ever wish to adjust your color (chroma) there is a "POT" that
you can tweek. It can be found near the OFF/ON switch. It is the only
pot on the left side of the board.

                   +-----------------+---+--- Ground

This is a simple common emitter amplifier.  It is a non-inverting current
amplifier and serves here to allow the video signal from the game to drive
a standard composite monitor with 75 ohm impedance.

In order to prevent the audio from interfering with the video signal, the
mixing oscillator must be disabled on the main circuit board.
On a 7800, remove the base lead of Q1.  It is located near the RF modulator.

The audio doesn't need any extra buffering.

Places to get signals:

1. from RF modulator
   pin 3 is video
   pin 1 is ground
2. from Expansion Interface on 7800
   pin 1 is ground
   pin 2 is +5V
   pin 3 is video
   pin 17 is audio
3. from main circuit board
on a 78000, video and ground are across C7; +5V and audio are across C4

This circuit may not work or be required with all versions of the 2600.
It is required for the 7800 and the Sears Video Arcade II version of the
2600.  It is probably not necessary for a 5200.
