Samurai Shodown / Crystal Dynamics
 __
 /\ Overview -
 >~~'~~~~~~`~~~~

	I never really got off on the Neo until World Heroes came out, until then
the games on the system were quite uninteresting to me(Baseball 2020, NAM: 1975,
etc...).  However, once World Heroes came out, it proved to me that the Neo
could put out some great fighters.  Samurai Shodown really helped push the Neo
for a while.  The unusual characters and the level of animation in the arcade
really made this game stand out.  Then, at about the same time that we all
started hearing about Samurai Shodown ][ for the arcade,  Crystal Dynamics(at
SCES '94) announced that they had acquired the rights to bring it to the 3DO.
 __
 /\ Options -
 >~~'~~~~~`~~~~

	When you first boot Samurai Shodown, you realize the true meaning of the
word "port".  This one screams it at full blast all the way through the game.
Crystal Dynamics didn't even put their trademark 'Crystal Dynamics' animation
at the start and there's not even any previews of upcoming games.  Anyway,
after a still 'Samurai Shodown' screen loads, you get to see the intro to the
arcade redone perfectly on the 3DO.  Once you're past that you get a main
menu, from here you can choose what level of difficulty to play on(easy,
normal, hard, or arcade), resume a save game(ie..it'll save if you don't
continue a game), or go to an options screen.  The options screen allows
some interesting configurations...for example;  Deathmatch on/off(timer
or no timer), weapons on/off, or blood on/off, or reset the high scores.
After that you can begin a game with either controller by pressing the
play/pause button.
 __
 /\ Gameplay -
 >~~'~~~~~~`~~~~

	The character selection screen looks exactly like the arcade, and after
selecting a character you'll watch your character move about while waiting
for player 2 or the cpu to pick your opponent.  The defending character will
be taunted be their opponent and off it loads the scenery.  Up to this point
loading had not been a problem to any annoying level.  However, after the
judge says 'En Garde' it will load.  We roughly counted 6 or 7 seconds for
this load.  After playing Way of the Warrior and SSF2T this started to get
annoying simply due to the fact that in these other games, once the
environment loads, you're ready to fight and with this it loads, freezing
the screen.  Its not hideously bad or anything, it just kind of ruins the
feeling.  The moves and fights are pretty much arcade perfect, and the
animation is just as close to the arcade.  There is some bogging if there
is a lot of movement going on and both players are far away from each
other.  The level to which this slows down depends mainly on which
characters are being used and where you're fighting.  Overall, the control
is easy to use however I do prefer the way Capcom handled the controls on
SSF2T more.  In this the A, B, and C buttons will do the weak/strong
punches.  To do the weak/strong kicks you have to hold in the right
shift button.  Another downside to this is that you cannot configure
the controls on any menu and once again, you really need to have a
'fixed' Panasonic controller or one of the newer controllers from the
different companies in order to be able to pull most of the special
moves off easily.

 __
 /\ Overall -
 \~~'~~~~~`~~~~

	There has been some disappointment circulating the nets in regards to
this game.  Mainly from some of the die-hard Samurai Shodown arcade fans.
For one thing, I guess that after some fights there are supposed to be
quick animations of Anakusa watching your progress.  Others have complained
of actual 'bugs' in the game.  For example during the bonus round, if you
play with Earthquake and you jump towards the top of the screen and try to
slice the target, he will disappear and reappear on the floor.  Also,
some of the characters that have special teleporting moves(Hanzo, Galford)
when used will sometimes be able to come down from the air and hit you
even if you are out of range.  Overall, the largest section of the
complaints has come in regards to the sound.  Rumor has it that Crystal
Dynamics was not allowed the digital samples from the arcade from SNK and
had to actually go to an arcade and tape record them themselves.  The
music is of good quality and actually the sound effects are not abysmally
bad.  However, compared to the arcade, it isn't hard to notice the degraded
sound effects.

	Aside from this, it has been generally concurred(and I agree as well)
that compared to all the other home ports of SS to other systems, the 3DO
easily outclasses them all.  Also, in regards to the frequency of the
'bugs', I had to be told about them, I never found any myself.  If you
have a 3DO and liked the arcade, most likely I'd say that you won't regret
it if you buy it.  But if an arcade perfect port is an absolute must for
you, I'd suggest trying to find a dealer who has a kiosk running it.

Overall -
 >Graphics     - 80%   (The artwork is really nice, although afterall it
			        is hand drawn so it doesn't move into the
				  '1000's of colors' notch.)
  Sound        - 70%   (I think that the bad quality of the sound was
				  blown a little out of proportion by some users
				  however, compared to the arcade as well as other
				  3DO fighters, it left a little to be desired.)
  Control      - 85%   (The controller is responsive and with one of the
				  newer pads, the special moves aren't too hard to
				  pull off.)
  Playability  - 90%   (Its a fun game. Adding weapons to the 2D fighter
				  genre was a good idea.  I still haven't beaten
				  it on one player mode and in two player mode,
				  like most fighters, its good fun.)
  Replay Value - 75%   (Unlike other home versions, all the characters are
				  present and with lots of special moves and nice
				  presentation combined with a good opponent
                        you'll be playing this one for a while.)

	2.2 - Need For Speed / Electronic Arts Canada


Overview -

	A few months back, we heard about a game that would be along the
same lines of Ridge Racer or Daytona with lots of texture mapped
graphics and intense racing action.  They called it Need For Speed.
But, when Bryan got it a few days back we found very little similarities.
It reminded us of Test Drive ][ on the Amiga and PC, but with those
special 3DO style graphics found in Road Rash.  It does have better
color and graphics than Road Rash, it even appears to be faster, if 
you choose a car with a high top speed.  Some people like it and some
people hate it.  It has its plusses and minuses.

Options -

	Upon booting NFS you see a nice EA intro followed by FMV of the
various cars of choice driving around.  It appears that this game is
sponsored by Road & Track magazine. You eventually arrive at a main
menu.  Here you can do a number of things; customize multiple in-game
options, choose your car (8 different cars like a Lamborghini or 
Ferrari and others), choose your (optional) opponent's car or a
clock, choose the environment for your race (3 environments), or
start the race.  Choosing a car is very nicely done with a
picture of the car displayed along with 2-3 pages of stats, as well
as a voice describing the features of the car in a very enthusiastic
manner.  Also, you can choose to watch a video of the car in full
FMV.  The options screen allows various things, such as; if your
car has ABS breaks enabled\disabled, etc.  There are 3 environments
to race in each containing 3 different tracks.  For a total of 9
race tracks.

Gameplay -

	  The control is pretty realistic, the degree to which the
wheel is turned can be controlled by the pad, there are 3 views
from which you can play the game; in-car view, chase view, and
sky view.  The in-car view is the best one to use, you'll find
yourself reacting better due to the fact that things will come right
at you.  A downside to this game is that movement to the left
and right of the track is very restricted, even if the land around
the track looks as if it would permit such movement(darn, I really
wanted to hit that moose..heheh).  Another advantage to playing
from the in-car view is the differences in the dashboards that the
different cars have.  Each car also turns, accelerates, and brakes
with realistically different levels depending on the car you choose.

There are two basic styles to racing, against the clock or the
opponent.  Ultimately, playing against the opponent is really
just another car on the track.  However, like you his car is
exceptional and since the goal of racing against an opponent is
to beat the opponent, you'll find yourself driving differently
than you would against the clock.  Depending on how you fare
against the opponent, you'll see a video after the race of him
telling you what he thinks of your performance.  His attitude really
makes you wanna run him off the road.  Having an opponent also
adds other aspects, for example, he'll drive in front of you and pull
away in time to let you get smacked by oncoming traffic.   The
police are also present in this game forcing you to accelerate to
high speeds to keep them from catching up.  Try to watch your
speedometer, chances to get away from the cops will come up, good
driving techniques will keep them at bay more than a fast car.

One of the best features of this game is the replay feature.  In
this mode you can shift between multiple views unavailable during
the regular game to watch your own performance.  Watching
car crashes is the best use for this tho', watching how many times
a cop car spins while in the air after a head-on collision with
your opponent is really good fun.

Overall -

	This is a title that at first glance I thought had good
graphics but had poor playability.  This game will be hard when you
first start, you just need to get used to the controls and don't get
discouraged if you crash a lot.  Remember to drive realistically until
you get the hang of it.  Slow down when going into turns and
experiment with the different cars on the different tracks to find
which car is the best suited.  After I played it for about an
hour and got used to the way the controls worked and started playing
it from the first person point of view rather than the out-of-car
Cruisin USA view, I really started to like it.  Now,  I play it all
the time.  There are nine overall races, and you have your own best
time on each as well as an opponent to beat, plus 8 cars to choose from
to keep the replay value high.  Also, rumours say that EA will be
releasing expansion disks with more cars and tracks expanding the
already richly detailed environments that NFS delivers.

Overall -

Graphics -93%  (Looks like Road Rash with better graphics and cars)
Sound    -72%  (no in game music, I didn't really care for the
			tunes but the music was of CD quality.)
Control  -85%  (multiple controller configurations and its quite
			sensitive.)
Play     -84%  (Once you get the hang of it you'll be screaming
			down the tracks.)
Replay   -76%  (if you really like racers then I'm sure you'll
			be playing this a lot.)
-------------
Overall  -82%  (Its Test Drive done right.  Good graphics and good
			fun trying to beat others' score.)


2.3   Starblade / Panasonic / Namco

Overview -

This is the arcade....and then some, one of the best overall conversions
of an arcade to a home system ever.  Starblade is a first person
perspective 3D shooter.  You play the role of gunner for the Geostorm,
a ship with one primary mission: to destroy the Octopus power generator
at the heart of your enemy's home world.

Gameplay  -

Technically, yes this is a point and click shooter.  The difference between
this and other 'on-the-rails based games is that the way the game is visually
presented does not make you feel so much like you're 'on-the-rails'.
Also, most games like this use sprites(and very few of them) to give you
objects that you can actually interact with and then lays them on top of a
rendered movie.  The difference? no rendered movie and no sprites, instead
you get HUGE massively detailed battle platforms and tons of enormous
asteroids which are not part of the backgrounds for you to obliterate. And
that's just the environment, also, you get attacked by tons of ships, lasers
bursting in full.

Also, after bootup you get a choice of which style game to play; Starblade
(polygon based) classic which looks identical to the arcade and, Starblade
3DO with fully texture mapped polygons.  Visually this game is incredible
just as it was in the arcade

Overall -

This is one of the best conversions from an arcade to home that I've ever
seen.  When they first announced this, I wasn't sure if they'd make it
perfect to the arcade(polygons only) or if they'd really let the 3DO
show what it can produce.  Well, it looks like you've got the best of
both worlds here and the gameplay is just as intense as that of the
arcade.

Overall -

Graphics - 95% (The classic style is just as good as the arcade.
                However, the 3DO style really blows you away.)
Sound    - 90% (Just like the arcade you're constantly hearing
		     radio transmissions of orders and status. The
                quality is also very high.)
Control  - 80% (I'd have to recommend a 'fixed' controller, also
			after using the controller at the arcade, I felt
			that the crosshairs you move with the d-pad was
			not quite as lightning quick, however, the arcade
			wasn't using a d-pad.
Play     - 85% (Its a very intense game, you must keep blasting at
			all times just for a chance of getting anywhere.
			Just like the arcade.
Replay   - 70% (The game saves off high scores and with the number
			of targets to blast throughout the game, you will
                probably rebeat yourself many times to come.
			However, being that it is an 'FMV' game, once
			you've seen it all, you've seen it all.
----------------
Overall   - 84% (Ultimately its a great conversion of the arcade,
			 both play modes will satisfy Starblade purists,
			 and graphics purists alike.)

  Overview  : Industry has taken over the planet. Three quarters of
  --------    the Earth's surface has been covered with concrete and
              steel cities and wastelands. The Iron Fist Corporation
              (IFC) has used military force to conquer governments
              and create a world-wide military dictatorship.

              Recently the IFC developed a new weapon for the urban
              areas; a 45-foot tall piloted robot known as the Iron
              Soldier. With such a weapon they will have no trouble
              maintaining their hold on the populace.

              However an organization has been formed to stop the IFC.
              This resistance has managed to capture an early
              production Iron Soldier unit.

              As a member of the Resistance your job is to pilot this
              captured Iron Soldier in your war against Iron Fist.

  GRAPHICS ______________/||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||     |
  |                       '----------------------------------------'
  |  First off it's nice to see that Checkered Flag won't be the
  |  only Jaguar game with a decent menu. You are presented with
  |  a main screen surrounded by 16 smaller screens. Each of the
  |  smaller screens contains a nice hand-rendered image depicting
  |  that level. By moving the joypad around you highlight the level
  |  you want to play. When you move from one box to the next, the
  |  current level will be depicted in the main screen. The main screen
  |  is actually a texture mapped cube and flips around when you switch
  |  levels.
  |
  |  Next is the arming screen. A 3D representation of your battle-
  |  mech occupies the lower right hand corner. This is where you
  |  position your weapons at. The mech is 3D, and you can angle it
  |  to the left or right for effect. There are six positions to
  |  choose from. There are 8 weapons total, which are contained
  |  in 8 boxes on the left of the screen. As you highlight the
  |  box the weapon rotates. At first I thought theses were rendered
  |  sprite sequences, but they are all composed of gouraud shaded
  |  polygons light-sourced in real time. I don't know how much others
  |  might like it, but I thought the effect was VERY cool. It looks
  |  very realistic.
  |
  |  The game itself is equally impressive. The landscape uses a
  |  combination of texture mapping, gouraud shading, and real-time
  |  light sourcing. I was expecting (from the demo tape) that only the
  |  enemies would be texture mapped. I was pleasantly surprised to
  |  find that all of the objects and parts of some of the buildings were
  |  mapped too. Mostly it was stuff like gates, doors, and roofs.
  |  However there are a few buildings in the game which are fully
  |  texture mapped. Gouraud shading was used to very nice effect to
  |  accent some of the buildings as well. The power plant actually
  |  looks round and smooth. Even the flat un-shaded buildings looked
  |  good. No simple boxes here; they came in a variety of config-
  |  urations. And you don't just get tanks and helicopters to fight;
  |  there are several different enemies that attack you, including
  |  two other types of tanks, cars, two types of trucks, VTOLs and
  |  Airplanes (which bomb you), fixed Gun and missile turrets, and
  |  even Naval Warships, as well as other IS units. Only the heli-
  |  copters and one type of tank are texture mapped, but every thing
  |  else is light sourced (including the gouraud shading on the IS
  |  units). Blowing up buildings reveals boxes which contain various
  |  power-ups and mission goals and such. all are nicely texture
  |  mapped.
  |
  |  The explosions were the best though. When you destroy a building
  |  it breaks up into a shower of polygon debris, all light-sourced
  |  in real time accompanied by fantastic fire and smoke sprites. The
  |  debris bounces a few times and then disappears. Destroying the
  |  buildings from a great distance looks even more impressive (the
  |  polygons don't "pop" in and out of existence like in Cybermorph
  |  and Checkered Flag, so you can see stuff from very far away...).
  |  The explosions of the enemies are just as cool; miniatures of the
  |  buildings. When you shoot a helicopter overhead (you can almost
  |  shoot straight up), the debris falls all around you, which
  |  helps to immerse you in the environment. There are a variety of
  |  different buildings, including houses, water towers, control
  |  towers, skyscrapers, power plants, residential blocks, factories,
  |  Fuel tanks and more.
  |
  |  The camera angle pans in every direction. You can look down at
  |  your feet so you can see yourself squash tanks and houses. The
  |  camera bobs up and down as you walk just like in DOOM, and is
  |  timed to match your steps (so are the "stomping" sound fx).
  |
  |  More texture mapping is about the only way I think the graphics
  |  could be improved, but it really does look arcade-quality. There
  |  are several variations on the background pics (which are fairly
  |  well done, but could be better), depending on the mission. The
  |  textures were air for the most part, and some of them were quite
  |  good. I'd also like to mention that Atari's little problem with the
  |  manuals seems to be solved. All of the recent ones including
  |  this one look great.

  PLAY MECHANICS ________/||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
  |                       '----------------------------------------'
  |  Hey, What do ya know. This game ain't just pretty graphics. =)
  |
  |  There are 16 different missions, and let me tell you, there's
  |  lots more variety here than you think. Each mission is different.
  |  The missions are divided up into groups of four, and you can only
  |  advance after you've passed all four missions in your present group.
  |  You don't get all the weapons either; you get weapons along the
  |  way, but you have to "earn" them by completing the missions (just
  |  like in AvP). At the beginning you start out with the Cassey Assault
  |  Rifle, which is a decent general purpose weapon. Next is the Parker
  |  Chain Cutter (a giant chain saw), The Badger Hand Grenades (which
  |  can destroy several buildings at once if used correctly), Rachels
  |  Gatling Gun (a high speed auto-cannon), the Wolf Pack Rocket
  |  Launcher, The Charlotte Rail Cannon (a heavy autocannon powered by
  |  magnetic superconductors which is very accurate at long ranges),
  |  the Slate Heavy Shield (a shoulder mounted deflector which lessens
  |  the damage you take), and finally the Sable Cruise Missile (my
  |  personal favorite =).
  |
  |  The AI is done well. Helicopters and other enemies can sometimes
  |  anticipate, and also dodge behind objects and sneak up on you.
  |  The difficulty can be set from the options menu, but it
  |  is very challenging even on "Easy". Challenging *without*
  |  being frustration. Yes, there is a difference. Though it seemed
  |  like it took me forever to beat some levels I never really got
  |  frustrated; I was always having fun.
  |
  |  It's a blast going through the landscape and blowing stuff up. The
  |  only other game I can think of that felt the same way the first
  |  time I played it was DOOM. The missions are varied enough to keep
  |  it interesting. Ranging from offensives, defense, and timed
  |  tasks, and others. There's something here for everyone. The camera
  |  bobbing combined with the stomping sound effects was nice.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------


                          ...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10.
  SOUND _________________/||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||       |
  |                       '----------------------------------------'
  |  The effects are very well done, and the music tracks fit the
  |  game perfectly (they remind me of Knight Rider for some
  |  reason...).
  |
  |  When you walk a metal stomping sound accompanies your steps, and
  |  gets louder the faster you go. The explosions are also
  |  louder the closer they are to you. I did not personally notice
  |  any voices canceling each other out. Music also plays during the
  |  menus and the different tracks can be directly sampled via the
  |  options menu.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------


                          ...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10.
  CONTROL _______________/||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
  |                       '----------------------------------------'
  |  The control is, quite simply, a dream. The button configuration
  |  can be changed, as well as the joypad directions (you can set
  |  it normally or reverse, like Cybermorph), but the default is
  |  perfect the way it is. By pressing "C" you can speed up your
  |  head movement a bit, and pressing "C" and "A" at the same time
  |  increases it even more.
  |
  |  The game comes with an overlay. Each position on the mech's
  |  body has a different number, so switching weapons is pretty
  |  instinctive. Pressing the "2" key allows you to turn the mech's
  |  torso like a turret, so you can shoot to the side while walking
  |  forward. The selected weapon appears in a screen at the lower
  7|  right hand corner of the cockpit display. An information bar
  |  is at the top of the screen, and displays things like
  |  which weapon you're using and what the contents of the boxes
  |  are.
  |
  |  The cockpit display is convenient without obstructing too much
  |  of the viewing area. In the upper left hand corner is a diagram
  |  of the IS unit and all the weapons (which match the keypad
  |  overlay. The upper right hand corner is the speed indicator (con-
  |  figured the same way as Cybermorph...you can back up in Iron
  |  Soldier as well...) and a nice radar screen which shows everything
  |  in range (the Rail gun and Cruise Missile are the only weapons
  |  that can fire beyond the radar's range).
  |
  |  The game save works like DOOM; your game is automatically saved
  |  but only after you complete a set of four missions (except for the
  |  last four, which are saved one at a time). You can load the saved
  |  game or start a new game from the main menu. You can always go back
  |  to any mission you've previously completed, but you only have
  |  to complete it once.
  |
  |  As with most Jaguar games, you can control Music and Sound FX
  |  volumes separately while in the game by pressing pause.
  |
  |  This game has better control than any other 3D game I've ever
  |  played. I can't find one flaw.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------


                          ...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10.
  PROGRAMMING ___________/||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||   |
  |                       '----------------------------------------'
  |  Impressive. The frame rate is very smooth. If you blow up several
  |  buildings directly in front of your face, you will see some
  |  brief bogging. Other than that, it's consistently fast.
  |
  |  The control and collision are perfect. The graphics and play
  |  mechanics say all that needs to be said. The Jaguar needs more
  |  programming like this.

  OVERALL/FUN FACTOR ____/||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
  |                       '----------------------------------------'
  |  I've died and gone to 3D heaven. =)
  |
  |  By far the best game on the Jaguar to date; one which really shows
  |  off the potential of this system. This is only a first generation
  |  game folks, and Eclipse has two more projects in development;
  |  including an Iron Soldier II.
  |
  |  The game is easy to control and challenging for all skill levels.
  |  If you are not very good at video games, don't worry; even if you
  |  never get past level 1, just running around shooting stuff is fun.
  |  A multi-player option would have increased this game's replay value,
  |  but even as it is I will be playing this game for some time to
  |  come.
  |
  |  A new high water mark for the Jaguar. Tempest 2000 doesn't look
  |  quite as impressive to me anymore. If you have a Jaguar you must
  |  try this game out. A definite must-buy.

4.2  Cybermorph / Atari Corp. / ATD
				(for Tony Belding)

Overview -

	Ok, this is it, this is what you get as a pack-in game when
you buy an Atari Jaguar.  Ultimately you have pods, you must retrieve
a required amount of pods to continue on to the next world and there
are fifty 3D gourad shaded planets for you to explore and obliterate.
IMO, this is still the best Jaguar game, there's some large areas to
explore and overall, the Jaguar handled it rather well.

Gameplay -

	After inserting Cybermorph, you get presented with a morphing
Cybermorph title screen that looks kind of nice considering it's all
inside a little cartridge.  After that, you are taken to a planet
selection screen.  The fifty planets have been divided up into small
groups based on difficulty.  Also, each map has a 4-digit access code
which you can use to resume your game.

	Well, your ship is a cross between a plane and a hovercraft.
Also, the ship will change its shape in-flight to adjust itself
for whatever action you are trying to perform (ie.. the wings move
back when accelerating, etc...). You can control your altitude and
direction using the controller pad, as well as your acceleration
and choice of weapons with the buttons.  There is a good variety
of enemies to fight, and although with combinations of them, you
may have no choice but just to blast away, ultimately you will need
to learn strategies depending on who you're fighting (for example,
some of the stationary turrets will miss even if you're standing
still, use this to your advantage).  Also, don't get discouraged if
you can't beat a world.  Its advisable to spend a few rounds getting
blasted just learning the worlds and where all the pods/enemies are.

Overall -

	I had quite a bit of fun with Cybermorph.  Fifty worlds with
total freedom of movement and lots of enemies, combined with the
basic Rescue On Fractalus(get the pods) plot, it worked out pretty
well.

Overall -

Graphics - 60%  (Gourad shading can look nice, but I've seen better
                 and it doesn't compare to texture mapped graphics.)
Sound    - 50%  (Basic sound effects. The talking computer was a
                 good concept, however it was quite possible to
                 hear everything she had to say after only the
                 first 2 planets.  Also, there is no music in the
			 game.)
Control  - 80%  (The controls were pretty easy to pick up.  The
                 use of the numeric keypad for weapons made selecting
                 them easy.)
Play     - 85%  (Its a fun game executed rather well, however it
                 does slow to a crawl when surrounded by lots of 
			 large untexture mapped polygons(ie..buildings).)
Replay   - 40%  (I played it on and off for about 2 weeks until I
                 beat it.  After that I didn't really want to play
                 it any more.)
---------------
Overall  - 63%	(I still think its the best Jag game, it just isn't
			 as spectacular as some of the newer games out for
			 the 32-bit systems.  The poor graphics and sound
			 really don't help any.)

>how the Jag coped with Doom.  etc..

Developing on the Jag started out fun, but pushing the jag hard
started showing up some architectural problems.

The system suffers from a critical lack of balance.  The central
processor is well over an order of magnitude slower than the risc
chips, but the risc chips are not suited to running the entire
program because of their small fixed code memories.

There is quite a bit of power there, but you have to go through
contortions to get a lot of it.

The worst problem is that the system has some hardware flakyness when
all the processors are banging on the bus at once.  This is what
causes the network errors (they aren't really network errors, they
are game errors that show up by different things happening on the two
systems).  In hindsight, I should have just run the net game without
all the processor overlap.  It runs a good deal slower, but it
doesn't get the errors.

Of cource, I would do several things differently if I was doing the
project again.  I know for sure how to make the rendering code 50%
faster.  This would allow you to either increase the horizontal
resolution from 160*180 to 256*180, or increase the speed to 20 fps
from 15, or run totally full screen at the same resolution with a
more complex world.

The problem is that Jag DOOM usually becomes speed limited by the
game logic, not by the rendering code.  The problems of movement
clipping and line of sight calculation for all the monsters are more
difficult to run efficiently on the risc processors.  The basic actor
logic is too bulky and spread out to run on one of the risc chips,
but it is really a bit too much for the 68k to handle when the
rendering is taking up most of the bus bandwidth.

We are not working on any more jag projects at the moment (Quake is
taking up all my time).  We gave Atari a lot of our time and effort,
and we are now in a "wait and see" mode.  If they hit their sales
projections, we will probably do something else late next year.  We
are probably going to license the jag DOOM code to some other
companies though, so you might see a similar game before that.

  From: Tony Belding
    To: Steve Bird
  Subj: Cyberaktiv Games

Steve, I see that you are an editor of Cyberacktiv Games On-Line.  I just got 
through reading Vol. 1, Issue 4.  I hope you will accept some constructive 
criticisms and pass them on to the rest of the crew there.

First thing I see in issue four is several press releases from 3DO.  You must 
realize putting those press releases in the magazine is rather pointless, since
they have already been posted elsewhere by the time the magazine is released.  
I would prefer that space be cut or else devoted to editorial material, or 
perhaps new product information from smaller companies that we don't hear so 
much about.  Why hasn't Cyberaktiv reported on the SNES 3DO controller adaptor 
or the infrared remote controllers, for example?  Could it be because y'all 
don't sell those items?

The magazine is beginning to appear extremely biased toward 3DO and against 
Jaguar -- even moreso than at the beginning.  For example, y'all suggested 
there's nothing "interesting" to review for Jaguar, yet managed to dredge up 
Crash N Burn, Total Eclipse, and Super Wing Commander for 3DO.  That doesn't 
seem quite fair.

Also, the reviews seemed rather "puffy" and failed to mention some well-known 
shortcomings of the reviewed games.  When three other magazines tell me a game 
is mediocre and Cyberaktiv tells me the game is great, I have to wonder what 
gives, especially when Cyberaktiv is also in the business of selling games.
I was boggled by the list of best Jaguar games.  It described Tempest 2000 with
one word, "rehash".  That's absurd!  Tempest 2000 is the best game available 
for the Jaguar, an experience unlike anything else available on any console, 
and the most intense shooter I have ever seen.  The list also named Alien Vs. 
Predator as "The biggest let down of 1994."  In reality, AvP is a wonderful, 
engrossing game, probably the second best Jaguar game after T2000.

Then, the editorial section used one word to describe Jaguar's prospects: Lynx.
That is not journalism.  That is a flame.  Furthermore, its a dumb flame.  The
Lynx has been my all-around favorite system for the last few years.  It has a 
library of over 70 games, with remarkably high overall quality.  I will be very
glad to own a Jaguar if it does as well as the Lynx.

In fact, Atari has done almost everything right with the Jaguar.  They have 
promoted it heavily with print and TV ads, and they have priced it well under 
their competitors.  It will always be the least expensive fifth generation 
console.  The recently announced price of $150 for the JagCD is also 
remarkable.  The ONLY thing Atari has done wrong is their failure to crank out 
new products, namely more games and the CD drive, in a timely manner.  Of 
course, that is one mighty big shortcoming and hard to overlook. That is why I 
am getting a 3DO.  However, I am saying give Atari credit where it is due.  
They have learned their lesson about advertising, and they are still doing what
they've always done best: cut-throat pricing.

If you all are serious about the magazine, and if you want to be taken 
seriously by your readers, there are some things you can do in the future.  
Let's see some fair coverage when Iron Soldier, Val D'Isere, Rayman and the 
JagCD arrive for the Jaguar.  Or, if 3DO is all you mean to cover, then at 
least rename the magazine to "Cyberaktiv 3DO" or somesuch.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although Steve already responded via netmail to Tony, we thought that his
letter deserved a response from the magazine by all the editors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Tony,

This magazine is not only just uploaded to the Internet and the FIDO netted
message bases, we also upload the magazine to bbs' that do not have
networked message bases.  Also, we do give out printed copies as well to
those that request it.  This is why you see press releases that you may have
already read before.  Also, its a lot easier for us and (we imagine) our
users to go to our old magazines to get those press releases(for use as
reference points or whatever) rather than having to search through a
subdirectory for a saved capture buffer.

Also, the reason why we don't cover everything, contrary to your given
reason is that not all products have press releases or we haven't seen them.

No company except Cyberaktiv advertises through us.  We receive no money or
payment for the work that we do.  We've all always wanted to write a
magazine on this subject.  We finally decided to.

 At the time that we wrote a magazine with reviews for Crash n Burn, Super
Wing Commander, and Total Eclipse, the only new title we had seen for the
Jaguar was Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story.  Honestly we feel that not
reviewing the title was better than reviewing it (g).  Actually, none of
us own Jaguars and we only had the chance to see Dragon at Mike's house,
none of us really wanted to review it and Jeff Pruett had been handling
the Jag reviews anyway.  

Also, the titles we did review are still (IOO) some of the best 3DO has
to offer and with Christmas coming up we felt that these titles had
been forgotten and shouldn't be.  New 3DO owners should not disregard
these titles just because they were some of the "1st generation" games.
Most of the magazines even agreed with our opinions of these games(ie..
Crash n Burn, Super Wing Commander, and Total Eclipse).  Die Hard gave
Cybermorph the cover of their mag one month.  We thought that this was a
good game too(at the time) but does even 5 good games constitute the
spending of $250?

Another thing you should note, unlike other magazines we pay the price
for our video games, we don't get them free.  Other magazines get them
for free and are very biased towards the companies who give them the
most titles and advertise in their magazine.  We are not granted
these 'privileges'.  If the reviews seem a little "puffy" that is
due to the fact that we bought these games, like them, and kept them.

You will be seeing a review of Microcosm, I sold that game and I think
it sucks.

You say our reviews were "puffy" and that we disregarded "well-known"
shortcomings of 3DO games that other magazines had pointed out.  Well,
we frequently disagree with the 'published' magazines.  For example,
when Die Hard Game Fan reviewed Off-World Interceptor, they said it
was too hard.  Steve agreed when he first got it, however
Bryan borrowed it and beat it within 24 hours(as proof, during the
ending credits the Colonel or captain guy's head gets edited and
placed on everyone in the room's head...it looks really funny).
Therefore are we going to say that the game's difficulty is a
shortcoming? No way.
    With some of these games, especially those by Crystal
Dynamics, different techniques must be applied to the way you
play the game and doing so usually gives the game a new light.

Also, our reviews of VR Stalker and Seal of the Pharaoh were pretty
much......."do NOT GET THESE games, they bite."

You also disagreed with our top ten lists in our last issue(V.1 #4).

You said that calling Tempest 2K a "rehash" was absurd and that it
is an "experience unlike anything else available on any console and
the most intense shooter you have ever seen.".  To this day, we
have never fully understood what all the fuss was about.  You have
Tempest, a concept in shooters created in 1981 combined with all
the niceties of more modern shooters(bonus levels, power-ups, etc.).
Well, at the time it came out most of the Cyberaktiv staff (Steve,
Bryan, and Dan) still owned Jaguars and none of us bought it
even then.  Steve played it for almost an hour at our local Atari
dealer looking for something to support all the hype being put
out about it.  To us it was no big deal.  It isn't that graphically
impressive and the music hardly sounds better than a 4 voice tracker
playing with a couple voices(maybe 2-4) being used for sound effects
and announcements.  The 'Melt-O-Vision' is hardly at all different
from some of the effects that we've seen the 3DO put out from its
audio CD player or in Powers Kingdom(heck, there are Atari ST Euro
demos that put this effect in Tempest to shame and you can find a
used ST for $75).  Also, the title screen (the Atari symbol)
warbled so slowly that you could easily watch each scanline being
shifted to the right or the left and it took it a while to get all
the way down to the bottom of the screen.  Some users say that
this was done for effect, however we think a really fast version
of this(or one that sped-up and slowed down) would've been much
better and it makes me wonder if Jeff Minter would've liked this
effect as well, yet couldn't get the Jaguar to pull it off.

You also didn't like us referring to AvP as, "The biggest let-down
of 1994".  Well, AvP, Checkered Flag 2, Kasumi Ninja, Tiny Toon
Adventures, Club Drive, Tempest 2K, and the "Panther" games were
announced in October of 1993 along with the original press release
for the Jaguar.  AvP was (among most users) the most eagerly
anticipated Jaguar game and its first scheduled release date was
January of 1994.  However, Atari started to handle things like
they usually do and started moving the release date of this product
back along with many others. All the games I listed above were all
supposed to be out by (at latest) May of 1994.  Also, along the
course of waiting for AvP, many 'features' were discussed and the
impression was given by Rebellion and Atari that these would be
in the game.  Features such as:30 fps, 3 player network, 2 player
Voice Modem support, lots of RPG elements, and with huge sprites
with good animation in a fully texture-mapped 3D environment.

Finally in early October 1994 (10 months later than the original
release date), we get AvP.  Most of the features I listed above
were COMPLETELY absent except the texture mapped 3D environment.
The 30 fps ended up being about 7-12 and the animation was quite
choppy having about 1-3 frames of animation per move made by a
character.  On top of that, there was no music, it took about as
long for the Jag to decompress the upcoming level as it would
for a CD-ROM unit to load (some Jag users complain about the 3DO
doing this yet they had little probs with AvP's depack time),
and the save games don't remember what bad guys were dead and
where they were.

Saying a game is a big letdown, doesn't necessarily mean its a
bad game, if you enjoy it then you enjoy it.  However after all
the time we waited and all that we were promised, AvP for us
did not live up to all the hype that was generated about it and
especially considering all that we were promised, after playing
it we felt that calling it the "Biggest letdown of 1994" was
most definitely warranted. Sam Tramiel stated to some extent
that AvP sold to over half of the installed Atari user base.
This does not constitute a good game.  Lets use a metaphor to
explain.  Say you're in the desert, there's no water and no
food and you're close to death.  Then a helicopter drops a
crate of muddy water and moldy bread.  It would be the best
food you've ever had in your life given the situation.  Does
that make sense?  My point; when there's hardly anything to
choose from, and you're starving you'll glorify anything you
can get.  Some of us aren't that financially strapped.

Also, a point to remember is that we all have Pcs and a lot
of the users out there do too.  Everyone kept saying that you
can't compare AvP to Doom.  We believe that this is untrue.
If you have a bunch of people that have had very intense
feelings while playing a game and another game comes along in
a similar genre that isn't as intense then I think you can say
that the one that is less intense deserves to be credited as being
so.

We have no problem giving any system or game good reviews and when
we did the top ten lists, we ordered it in regards for that system
only, however the comments made next to the games were more
global.  If a game on the Jag is good, but a 3DO game of similar
fashion is just as good but with texture mapping, a nice intro,
or/and the graphics are more detailed(ie..Cybermorph vs. Shockwave)
then we'll say that Cybermorph is a good Jaguar game but it sucks
compared to Shockwave.

In regards to our predictions for the industry in 1995, you claim
that our referring to the Jaguar with one word..."Lynx" was a
flame, it was not.  We just think that it will follow in its
footsteps,  you will see lots of hype at the start, yet when it
doesn't pick up as fast as Atari needs it too, they'll start to
let the 3rd parties try and keep it alive.  After about 6
years , the Lynx has over 70 games.  The technology of the Lynx
(even evidenced in the games) was and is superior to all the
other mainstream handheld portables around in the States.  Yet,
Sega's Game Gear has over 200 titles and Lynx is still at 70+.
Who's fault is it?  We believe it to be the way Atari
mismarketed and abandoned the product as a reason for the
Lynx's current state.

Also, if you don't mind getting 70+ titles(not all of which were
that great) over a course of about 6 years for your Jaguar then
so be it, have fun.

Another thing I should remind you of is that 80% of the consumer
market still believes Atari went bankrupt years ago after the
failure of the 2600.  This is something that pops up in my
conversations with other consumers quite often.  Sorry to offend
you, but it is not 1979, the industry is VASTLY different.

You then go on to say that Atari has almost done everything right
with their Jaguar.  Cutthroat pricing? Try outdated, rehashed
technology that offers nothing innovative over the current
32 bit competition.  68000, does the 70's ring a bell to you?  On
the Jaguar you have 16 games after over a full year, and that's
including the four Panther games.  The software developers are
taking longer to get games out and fit them into a 3-4 meg cart
than it is taking developers on the 3DO to write at an equal if
not usually better level and fill the CD with rendered
animations, or Hollywood level movie footage(you know what I mean).

You also say that putting the Jag CD out for $149.99 is remarkable.
However, at cost you can get a dual speed CD-ROM drive for the PC
for about $100, now do you think that the Virtual Light Machine
hardcoded into it really justifies a $50 tack-on? Heck, Cthugha
lightshow for the PC CD is shareware.  Also, there won't be a pack-in
game, this can be good and bad depending on how you look at it,
however if its true that the Jag CD won't be out until early/mid
January, then good luck finding software as that the release
dates for the JAG CD games don't start until late January/early
February and that's only if Atari is accurate with its release
dates.  Hey, wasn't the Jag CD supposed to be out in April of
1994?

Also, remember when the Lynx came out, we all saw lots of ads on
TV and paper as well.  Granted, they ARE advertising, and
it looks as if (by the ads and press releases) that they are
pursuing a more aggressive posture.  However, most of this
advertising is centered around..."64-bit, 64-bit, 64-bit!!!".
The Jag by all past systems method of determining bits is
64-bit.  However, if it is so much more powerful, then how
come the average consumer is still not seeing titles that
are quadruple the power of their SNES or Genny or double the
power of the 3DO.  This holiday season has seen a noticeable swing
in support for the 3DO on the nets, Internet, as well as sales
figures.  Most of these people are saying that most of the 3DO
games are better than most of the Jaguar games, now how is this
if 64-bit is better than 32-bit?  Yes, I know its all marketing,
but it seems that Atari's only response to potential customers
about the quality of the games is that it's 64-bits...its better,
it doesn't matter what you see these other systems doing.  To
be perfectly honest, I think that Atari has realized that this
method of advertising is the only way to convince people that
their system is the next step up.  But don't worry, it looks
like Sega is doing the same thing as well.  Maybe this can
explain Sega having to give $90 million to Atari.  $90 million
for Atari's marketing strategies?  Hahahahah just joking.
32x???  Hahahahah another joke.

Your accusation that we do not cover information because we
might not sell the item is false.

1)first off, the magazine is almost completely separate from
  the sales of soft/hardware.  We make no money off of this.
2)Nor, are any of us involved in the management of sales.
3)Your comments are made off of an intangible intuition, and
  not fact regarding this subject.
4)On top of everything above, Mike still continues to carry
  Atari Jaguar hardware and software.

And if this were true, then why do we give thumbs up for the 
PS-X?

Cyberaktiv 3DO? Hmm...we stated in the last mag also that
our Jaguar people didn't get the articles to us and that
they were waiting for future releases which is something
in the last mag you forgot to mention in your response.

Flame:Really, that is your interpretation and if you had
      read our predictions, there should have been plenty
	 of journalism in that for you.

Bias:some people may take our coverage as being biased.  I
     can only say, who isn't, and why is it such a big
	deal.  We speak from our preferences based on our
     experience.  If you read carefully in issue #4,

"You make the call, we just state the situation as we have
observed it from our own eyes and experience.  Whether or not
we are correct is debatable.  As we all know, time will be
the ultimate authority.  This editorial, is the speculation
of data which we have consumed over the past ten years."

"Don't get us wrong, we are not the ultimate authority on
this industry. To tell you the truth, I don't think anybody
is."

But obviously you didn't make note of this text.. and take
it with a grain of salt as it implies..But really, your
input is appreciated and noted.  This is what I mean by
"Debate is good".  Plus your message was healthy and logical.
But some of the premises and assumptions you were making were
false.

I hope that this response was helpful in your understanding
of our publication and we hope to see more feedback from users

As the editors of this magazine, we find it hilarious that certain
people on the nets say that 3DO is doomed and then proceed to defend
Atari.  First off, huge magazines (and not just video game magazines)
have given awards to games like FIFA 3DO, etc.  They have almost outsold
the Jaguar three to one.  There are eight and one half times as many
titles available for the 3DO (approximately 130+).  If 3DO gets into
major trouble financially, we think that Matsushita will help the 3DO
company.  With 500,000+ Panasonic units sold, Panasonic shows no signs
of withdrawing and is continuing future hardware and software
development with and for 3DO.  There are many peripherals that will
soon be hitting the market for 3DO.  The 3DO Company has already taken
steps to more efficiently handle the management and advertising (the
layoffs stink though).  Tons of new software is coming along with the
M2 expansion, which promises to be twice the power of Sega and Sony's
new platforms.  32x and Jaguar are not a threat.  These systems have
too little software and fall short on graphics and sound in comparison
to 3DO.  3DO has great potential with 700+ software developers.  3DO has
hardware partners that are many times the size of their competitors
put together.  All this would strongly suggest that the 3DO platform
is a viable next step in the video game industry.  We consider for a
system to be alive and have a future, that 1:  A lot of software
must be available and have a constant flow of new titles.  2:  Constant
flow of hardware sales.  3:  Massive capital and established reliable
brand name support.

Track Records :

Atari :  Very bad.

Sega  :  Good.

3DO   :  Good.

Next Step in Technology :

Atari :  Sort Of?

Sega  :  No Way.

3DO   :  Most Definitely.

This is what we see.  Once again, this is our opinion.
