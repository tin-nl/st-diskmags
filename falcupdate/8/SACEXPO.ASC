Preliminary SAC Expo Announcement:
 
Planning has just begun on the 1995 edition of the Sacramento Atari
Computer Exposition. This year the show will be held on April 22nd,
1995. As has been the case for the past three years, the show will be
held at the Towe Ford Museum from 10 am to 6 pm. This year the show
is being sponsored by the Towe and is being organized by STAR
(Sacramento's Total Atari Resource) and YAC (the Yolo Atari Club).
 
We haven't even sent our vendor packets out yet and already several
companies have told us they are planning to attend. These include:
Oregon Research (of Diamond Back and Diamond Edge fame, as well as the
US distributors of HiSoft's products), A&D Software (whose products
include MegaCheck, Tax Wizard, Universal Item Selector, Universal
Network and the WinterTree line of software--Spelling Sentry, Gram
Slam and WinterTree Thesaurus--among other products), Gribnif Software
(creators of NeoDesk and Geneva, and ditributors of STalker, STeno,
Arabesque and Convector), Compo (distributors of Speedo-GDOS 5.0 and
tons of other great German software), STeve's Atari Sales (one of the
US's biggest Atari dealers), and ST Informer Magazine (one of the
oldest ST specific magazines still in operation).
 
Please expect this list to grow. Updated information will be posted
here in the future. I just wanted to get people to mark this date on
their calendar as early as possible. Vendors interested in attending
may contact YAC through e-mail at elhays@ucdavis.edu.
