    Yep, just as I suspected, ATARI gave up in the
computer business last year, so those who say
that they are manufacturing Falcons... I don't
know their source.

    Here's mine

 (from the Jaguar mailing list, and a response
  from Sam Tramiel to Dan's Dorman Article in
  U.S.A. today):  - check out item #4.

Hi folks. I grabbed this from the Business Wire:
 
ATARI RESPONDS TO DAN DORFMAN ARTICLE IN USA TODAY
 
SUNNYVALE, Calif., Nov. 8 -- The following was released today by the
Atari Corporation:
 
Atari senior management today rebuffed Dan Dorfman's November 7th USA
Today story. Commenting on Dorfman's report Sam Tramiel, Atari
President, said, "It is disruptive to the market to have a short
position fund manager such as Mr. Sass put out a self serving report
with critical information omitted and not even bothering to call the
Company to confirm. It is further disturbing that Mr. Dorfman condones
such behavior and comments on such positions."
 
The article, with testimonial from Martin Sass of M.D. Sass Investors,
was misleading and contained many inaccuracies such as:
 
1. Dorfman says that this is the second time that Sass shorted the
stock and that the first time was in April of 1993. From what Atari
understands the fact is that Sass did this in April of 1994 and that a
report by Dorfman in June of 1994 quoting Sass saying that Atari was a
bankruptcy candidate caused Atari stock to go down and benefitted
Sass's position of being short the Atari stock to the detriment of
Atari shareholders. In the months following the Dorfman report the
Atari stock recovered in price and closed on November 4th at 6 3/4.
Sass again is short. Atari and once more Dorfman issues a report
quoting Mr. Sass and Mr. Sass benefits as the Atari stock goes down
from 6 3/4 to 5 1/2 at closing on November 7, 1994.
 
2. Dorfman says that Atari officials were not available to comment.
The fact is that Dorfman called the Atari office on Friday November
4th while a Board of Directors meeting was in progress.
 
3. Sass says that there is a shortage of software. The fact is that
available software for the Jaguar is increasing with the delivery of
five new titles by the end of November. These are, "Doom" from ID
Software, "the best version of Doom on any platform" says John Romero
of ID; "Checkered Flag" from Atari, a complete 3D world Formula racing
game; "Club Drive" a 3D world game of driving simulation and chase;
"Brutal Sports Football" from Telegames, a no holds barred game of
football; and "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story" from Virgin Software, an
exciting fighting game based on the Universal Studio movie of the same
name. Sam Tramiel says, "Software delays did occur as the development
teams learned how to harness the power of the 64 bit Jaguar system.
Now the developers are up to speed; we expect there to be a continuous
stream of game releases throughout the balance of this year and into
1995 and the future."
 
The most recent release "Alien vs. Predator" (TM, Twentieth Century
Fox) which hit the retail shelves in October, is selling briskly, is
indicative of the technically advanced gaming experience which is
possible on the Jaguar system. In order to achieve a high degree of
game quality and the overall success of the Jaguar platform,
management has intentionally delayed the publishing of some titles.
Atari expects over 20 titles to be available by Christmas 1994.
 
4. Dorfman says that Sass sees a big write-off of the Jaguar system as
well as write-offs in Atari's PC business. The facts are that Atari is
					   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
out of the PC business and took write-offs in this area in 1993. There
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
are no more write-offs in the PC business for Atari. The Jaguar is the
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
leading technology in the interactive game market. Atari sees a very
promising future for this platform, which includes the introduction in
the near future of a CD peripheral and the possible entry into the
interactive cable market.
 
Atari will soon be publishing its third quarter financial results and
as expected will report a net loss of approximately $3.9 million as
compared to a $17.6 million loss for the same period in 1993. The loss
in the 1994 period was a result of delays in software releases as well
as expenses related to promotional activity.
 
An important fact omitted from the Dorfman article was the recently
announced agreements between Atari and Sega. Sega will license from
Atari a patent library for a one time cash payment of $50 million
(Atari's net being less contingent legal fees and costs). Sega will
also purchase $40 million of Atari stock at a price of $8.50 per
share, the same per share price paid by Time Warner in April of 1994.
The agreement also allows for Atari and Sega to cross license up to 5
titles per year on their respective platforms. Finally, it also
permits both companies to be publishers on each others platforms if
they desire. These transactions are subject to regulatory approval and
are expected to close shortly.
 
"The Jaguar represents Atari's philosophy of offering leading edge
technology at affordable prices and we feel it has a very bright
future," says Tramiel.
 
Atari Corporation (AMEX: ATC) markets interactive multimedia
entertainment systems, including Jaguar, the world's only 64-bit
system, and the only video game system manufactured in the United
States. Atari is headquartered at 1196 Borregas Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA
94089.

   So there are no further ATARI developments in the computer
are, for now.  No manufacturing.  Zero.  Nada.
