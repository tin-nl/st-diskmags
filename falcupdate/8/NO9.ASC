 >> FALCON UPDATE DIGITAL - ISSUE 9 <<
  =======================================

	It is *due* out  around April-May 1995.
	 But hell, you  never can tell..........

	   We  will  have plenty of free software,
	    bundles  of  articles to read including 
	     the  latest  on  the Jaguar, Falcon, TT
	      and I  think  I'll even start including
	       little snippets  from the PC world too.
	        Why?  because it will be relevant, that
	         is why.  Also  there  will be some more
	          crazy rantings from the Internet, a few
	           little  stories, some amazing jokes and
	            postings from Usenet... a parody on the
	             Edge magazine(?!), a receipe for French
	              Yanof Coffee Cake, a day in the life of
	               Brian  the goldfish and dare I say it?!
	                Yes... lots, lots more.................

	                  (contents  subject to change at editors
	                   discretion, ie its made up on-the-fly.)
