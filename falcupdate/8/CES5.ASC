Sports titles coming from Atari
 
SUNNYVALE, Calif. - Jan. 6, 1995 - Baseball for 1995 may be uncertain and the
National Hockey League still is not playing, but there will be sports galore
on the 64-bit Atari Jaguar this spring and summer. Atari Corporation today
announced that a number of new sports titles will be released in the first
half of 1995.
 
"We're going for the gold with sports-oriented games at Atari this year," said
Sam Tramiel, CEO of Atari Corporation. "Atari Jaguar owners will play hockey
with Brett Hull, golf with Jack Nicklaus, basketball with Charles Barkley and
all the baseball they want."
 
Sports games currently under development include: Charles Barkley-Shut Up and
Jam takes an in-your-face, over-the-top approach to America's favorite indoor
sport. Players will encounter some of the baddest b-ball players on the
streets as they try to rule the game's 2 on 2 streetball tournament. Charles
Barkley-Shut Up and Jam is expected by the end of the second quarter.
 
Brett Hull Hockey features super-realistic, digitized graphics and a real-time
3-D hockey rink.  Available on CD, Brett Hull Hockey will provide the most
realistic hockey video game simulation ever. Look for Brett Hull Hockey to
arrive in stores by the end of June.
 
Hardball Baseball will provide a graphically and statistically true-to-life
simulation of real baseball. Players will have the added option of customizing
teams and scheduling themselves for one game, a playoff series or an entire
season. Special software builds players' statistics as games
 
New Atari Sports Titles are played making Hardball Baseball even more
realistic. Atari plans to ship Hardball Baseball before the 1995 All-Star
game, if there is one this year.
 
Jack Nicklaus Cyber Golf, a CD title, is a photo-realistic golf game for the
Jaguar that utilizes over 9,000 images of Murfield Village Golf Course. This
course is the first that Jack Nicklaus created and is the site of the annual
Memorial Tournament. Well-known sports presenter David Livingston acts as a
virtual commentator to teach the first-time player how to play the game or
provide comments and suggestions for the more experienced players. Up to a
foursome can play Jack Nicklaus Cyber Golf, and the CD is expected to ship
late this spring.
 
Additional sport titles scheduled for the first half of 1995 include Troy
Aikman NFL Football (Williams Entertainment), White Men Can't Jump (TriMark),
CD League Bowling (V Real) and Sensible Soccer (Telegames).
 
Atari Corporation markets interactive multimedia entertainment systems,
including Jaguar, the world's first and only 64-bit game system, and the only
video game system manufactured in the United States. Atari is headquartered at
1196 Borregas Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089.
