>>> A VISIT TO THE MOTHERLAND <<<

I was coming home from san Fran today and i decided to stop by Atari, i 
was exepcting run arounds and asshole people, but it was the reverse.
I talked to the receptionist and two game testers and found out a few 
things...

1. the receptionist, although old knew alot about what was going on, but 
she didn't let me go to the game test room :(.
The sega deal seems like a big thing for atari, because she metioned it a 
couple of times... i was told the t2000 would be coming out for the sega, 
but avp would not. 300 toys'r'us stores will be carrying the jag, but 
having kiosks is just an option for them. the modem is finished for the 
jag, but they will not release it until a game comes out for it. the 
games i saw that would support it were doom(obviously), club drive, and 
soemthing else (memory lapse). she did confirm that quite a few games 
will be out by christmas though.

2. the gametesters just happened to be the parking lot, so i went over to 
ask directions ( i knew where i was going, i just wanted to know what 
they did) and i spoke to them for a while. apparently they work *very* 
long hours to get the games tested... so this kinda shows that atari *is* 
trying very hard. so down to the info...

	doom- is in production
	kasumi ninja- better graphics that mortal combat, some lag time
		      with game against the computer, it was programmed
		      by a 22 y.o. from englan and this is his first game!
                      definitely like MK though.
	iron soldier- they just said it was a totally bitchen game
	club drive- should be out in a couple of weeks, fast frame rate and
                    cool graphics
	zool2- good graphics, but it is very hard.


now for you flamers and information correctors... this is just what i was 
told, so take the information for what it is worth.
overall, i am glad i stopped by to check it out... i also found out that 
there will be a jag demo at my school on nov7 and 8... supported by IBM. 
cool!

see ya!
