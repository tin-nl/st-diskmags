Xenon's Shorts

Any of you who have ever read BYTE magazine have probably observed Jerry Pournelle's irritating 
column, where he yaks on about yet another 6-platter CD-ROM or multi-Terabyte hard disk thingy 
some obscure 'vendor' has sent him gratis in the hope of getting a cheap endorsement. The bad news 
is that this article (and perhaps some more in the future) adopts a similar informal style, where Xenon 
lets you rummage around in his 'shorts' (ooh no missus, no!) and share some of his experiences with 
recent Falcon stuff. The good news is that the piece doesn't emanate from Chaos Manor, Xenon's wife 
isn't called Roberta, and he is not currently advising any top-level NASA council on the correct way to 
install Windows For Workgroups in a zero-gravity environment. Anyway, that's enough ranting for 
the moment, here's the 'stuff' hinted at earlier.

P'd Off

If,  like me, you are at the point where the lack of Atari support for the Falcon is really peeing you off, 
take heart. Like you, I am fed up with being told of products which are eternally on the horizon but 
which consistently fail to materialise. Although the manufacturer has clearly no intention to promote 
the machine now or at any other time, one of the Falcon's innate strengths has won through yet again.

I'm talking about software compatibility, of course. Now you may think that there isn't much use in 
running old ST software on a Falcon, but think again. As long-established ST titles are upgraded, 
many are being enhanced for newer machines. This means that most new (non-games) releases have 
something extra for Falcon owners. A good example of this is ImageCopy 3, one of the best graphic 
utilities on the ST, now with enough features to blow most of its rivals out of the water. You will 
probably have seen ImageCopy at some stage, and may even have read full  views in the glossies. 
Most of these rightly praise the performance of the package on the ST. But the benefits to Falcon 
owners are also considerable, if you dig a little deeper. First of all, the file formats supported have 
been expanded to handle JPG. This feature, combined with the use of the Brainstorm JPEG Decoder 
(JPEGD.PRG), means that you can load and display these super-compressed True Colour images 
using the DSP chip, at speeds rivalling a 486/66 PC. Thus, if you have lots of True Colour TIF and 
TGA images taking up space on your hard drive, you can batch-convert the lot into JPG format files 
which occupy 20% of the space of the originals at 100% quality. Greater compression can be 
achieved, but this does degrade the image somewhat. 

It appears that ImageCopy 3 is unusual in supporting this level of quality, as most utilities seem to 
insist on some loss of detail. The manual suggests that this is achieved by only using part of the JFIF 
compression process, missing out the final 'quantisation' which reduces the detail in some areas of the 
picture. It should be remembered, though, that photo-realistic images such as scanned pictures and 
video grabs benefit most from JPG conversion, others such as cartoon and hand-drawn images do not 
come out so well.

One  problem with True Colour images on the Falcon is the limited size of the screen in 16-bit modes. 
This is a greater problem with VGA, the maximum size (of my setup) being 512 x 384 using the 
screen expander BlowUp030. JPGs at this resolution fall slightly short of good, as do most  other  
True Colour pictures. Luckily, ImageCopy does such a good job of dithering and adapting the image 
on a 256-colour display, you might never need to use the 16-bit screen again! I'm not exaggerating 
here, it really is that good. Even without any dithering, the quality of the display is awesome, and with 
various dither options combined with the 'adaptive' palette setting, it's almost impossible to see any 
colour  flaws at all, assuming you can wait a bit longer for the final image. Using a 256-colour mode 
means that you can also use much higher resolutions, 800 x  600 being a good bet for all but the 
largest of pictures. TV & RGB monitor display is also enhanced, going automatically into overscan 
mode when displaying a full-screen image. This gives you a 16-bit screen sized at 768 x 480 (I 
think!), and is probably the quickest configuration of all in terms of sheer speed of display.


Now all that blurb about screen modes and colour depths may only appeal to hard-core image freaks, 
but what does it mean to you? Well, ImageCopy 3 now also has a slideshow facility, which you just 
point at a directory of pictures and let loose. It will display all images regardless of type, with a 
variable delay and keyboard lock option. On the Falcon, this feature will rip through a bunch of JPGs 
at lightning speed, transforming your machine into a self-running image album. This feature is a 
great way of setting up a self-running display in much the same way as a Kodak Photo CD machine 
runs through your holiday snaps. It's also one of the best performing picture printers I have seen on 
any platform, supports enough image formats to be the only conversion utility you need, and comes 
with an excellent quality manual. And no, I don't work for the ST Club.

Backward Bother

If, like me, you've had problems getting Populous II to run on the Falcon, panic ye not missus. The 
latest version of Backward, the ST emulator, does the job a lot better than its predecessors. Previous 
versions appeared to run it, but I found that certain sound effects (the Whirlpool for instance), caused 
the whole thing to crash. But v2.70B appears to cure that problem. To get this mega-game running on 
your bird, just use the settings below. You can even install Pop II onto the hard disk for ultra-fast 
loading, and use the Backward MiniDesk to start POP2.TOS. The only drawback (if you can call it 
that) is that the whole game motors along at an increased speed, but you soon get used to it. Enjoy!

What Else?

There are quite a few exciting products on the horizon, and a couple of real stormers. Keep your eyes 
open for APEXMedia, which appears to be the long-awaited ChromaStudio  24 in a new form and, if 
the spec sheet floating around the Bulletin Boards is anything to go by, is even  better than its 
ancestor. Games players will no doubt be cheered by  the imminent arrival of Zero-5, a space combat 
game which features Falcon enhancements, and a Falcon-only version of the rather weird-sounding 
Robinson's Requiem. There are even a couple of freebies to be had in the shape of  the Black Scorpion 
FLI/FLC/FLH player APEXFLC.TTP and the German MPEG player MPEGDSP.TTP, both of which 
are the best yet for playing industry-standard animations and digitised video sequences. Little by little, 
these products are elevating the Falcon's prospects to new heights.

Well, that's it for this issue. Next time, Xenon will be back with a clean pair of 'shorts' (ooh gawd, 
vicar), and hopefully even more good news for dedicated followers of Falcon. If this really were Chaos 
Manor, I would end the piece by outlining Xenon's plans for the next month, which would invariably 
involve numerous trips round the USA carrying 3 or more 'portable' PCs, progressing novel-
collaborations with everyone from Umberto Eco to James Herbert, trudging round dozens of propeller-
head science conventions in a pair of vinyl flip-flops and telling NASA what shape their rockets 
should be. Back in the real world, Xenon will be out of the country for a spell, chairing a National 
Security Council Committee seminar on the alleged abduction of Whitley Streiber's guinea pig by 
extra-terrestrial beings.

Disclaimer

Any evidence of Frankie Howerd-esque asides within this article simply reflects Xenon's admiration 
for the late genius, and in no way indicates that he sometimes writes for ST Format. Well, not on a 
regular basis, anyway.
