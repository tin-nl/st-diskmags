Q. What is the Atari Jaguar?

A. The world's first 64-bit home console video game system.  Developed after
   three years of research, manufactured by IBM, the Jaguar offers high-speed
   action, spectacular graphic effects, and CD-quality sound for $250.

==============================================================================

Q. How does IBM fit into this?

A. IBM has a $500 million contract with Atari Corp. to assemble, test,
   package, and distribute Jaguar units.  Manufacturing is done at IBM's
   Charlotte, NC facility, and the Jaguar is IBM's first attempt at producing
   a consumer grade product for an outside vendor.  Specifically, Jaguar
   circuit boards are manufactured and assembled by an IBM subcontractor;
   IBM cases, tests, and packages final Jaguar units; units are then sent to
   Atari for distribution.

   IBM has no known participation in the design of the Jaguar.  IBM has no
   plans to create games for the Jaguar.

==============================================================================

Q. Okay, who did design the Jaguar?

A. Details are murky.  Atari claims that the Jaguar took over three years to
   develop, and was released because work was progressing faster than
   expected.  Seeing an opportunity to leapfrog the new systems from Nintendo
   and Sega, they decided to bring the machine to light.

   The Jaguar chipset is reportedly co-developed by Flare, a British company
   with ties to Atari, according to Jez San of Argonaut Software.  The
   proprietary chips are manufactured by Toshiba and Motorola.

==============================================================================

Q. What are the specifications of the Jaguar?

             Pause and Option buttons
             12-key keypad (accepts game-specific overlays)

  The Jaguar has five processors, which are contained in three chips.  Two of
  the chips are proprietary designs, nicknamed "Tom" and "Jerry".  The third
  chip is a standard Motorola 68000 used as a coprocessor.  Tom and Jerry are
  built using an 0.5 micron silicon process.

    - Joystick control

  - Motorola 68000 (processor #5)
    - Runs at 13.295MHz

   Communication is performed with a high speed 64-bit data bus, rated at
   106.364 megabytes/second.  The 68000 is only able to access 16 bits of this
   bus at a time.

   The Jaguar contains two megabytes (16 megabits) of fast page-mode DRAM,
   in four chips with 512 K each.  Game cartridges can support up to six 
|  megabytes (48 megabits) of information, and can contain an EEPROM 
|  (electrically erasable/programmable read-only memory) chip to save game
|  information and settings.  The Jaguar uses 24-bit addressing, and is 
   reportedly capable of accessing data as follows:

           Six megabytes cartridge ROM
           Eight megabytes DRAM
           Two megabytes miscellaneous/expansion

   All of the processors can access the main DRAM memory area directly.  The
   Digital Signal Processor and the Graphics Processor can execute code out of
   either their internal caches, or out of main memory.  The only limitations
   are that (1) they cannot perform "jump" instructions in main memory, and
|  (2) running out of the cache is much faster and efficient.  Some believe 
|  that the inability to jump/branch in main memory makes the main memory 
|  feature useless.

   Swapping data between the caches and the main memory is a quick, low 
   overhead operation, and therefore the main memory is often used as "swap 
|  space" for cache code.  The RISC compiler now included in the Jaguar 
|  developer's kit produces code that transparently swaps code through the 
|  cache.  This effectively lets developers write RISC code without concern 
|  for the cache size limits.

   Compressed cartridge data can be uncompressed in real-time, and ratios of
   up to 14:1 have been cited.  In theory, a Jaguar cartridge can store up to
   84 megabytes (672 megabits) of data, though actual results will vary widely.
   Compression is performed with JagPEG, an enhanced JPEG image decompression
   mechanism.

   Other Jaguar features:
   - Support for ComLynx I/O for communications with the Atari Lynx hand-held
       game system and networked multiconsole games (on DSP port, accessible
       by optional add-on connector).  Networking of up to 32 Jaguar units 
       available.
   - The two controller ports can be expanded to support "dozens" of
     controllers
     - Digital and analog interfaces
     - Keyboards, mice, and light guns are possible
   - Expansion port allows connection to cable TV and other networks
   - Digital Signal Processor port allows connection to modems and digital
     audio peripherals (such as DAT players)
   - One megabyte per second serial interface
   - 9600 baud, RS-232 serial port (accessible with optional interface)
   - General-purpose I/O bits via the cartridge port
   - Can accomodate future expansions of different processor types, I/O types,
       video types, and memory types and/or quantities.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Is the Jaguar really a 64-bit system?
 
A. The question is hard to resolve, largely because the definition of what
   constitutes an "N-bit" system has not been set.  Of the five processors in
   the Jaguar, only the object processor and the blitter are "true" 64-bit
   components.  Because the blitter and the object processor are in the Tom
   chip, by extension Tom is a 64-bit chip.  The Jaguar also uses a 64-bit
   memory architecture, according to Jez San of Argonaut Software.
 
   Some say the Jaguar should be considered a 32-bit system, as that is the
   maximum register size in the programmable processors (the 68000, the
   graphics processor, and the DMA sound processor).  Others say the Jaguar
   can be considered a 64-bit system, because 64-bit components are used, and
   the GPU can access 64 bits of data if required.  Again, the lack of an
   agreed-upon definition serves to complicate the issue.
 
   For the record, the opinion of most third party developers and observers
   is that the Jaguar is indeed a 64-bit system.
 
==============================================================================

Q. How can a graphics processor be the CPU?

A. The 64-bit custom graphics chip is a good general purpose RISC unit, but it
   has been optimized for graphics work.  Developers are free to specify which
   processor(s) to use in a program, as desired.

==============================================================================

Q. What kind of special effects can the Jaguar do?

A. The Jaguar is capable of doing the following visual effects:

   - High-speed scrolling (Object Processor).
   - Texture mapping on two- and three-dimensional objects (GPU and Blitter).
   - Morphing one object into another object (GPU).
   - Scaling, rotation, distortion, and skewing of sprites and images
       (Object Processor).
   - Lighting and shading from single and multiple light sources (GPU and
       Blitter).
   - Transparency (Object Processor).
   - "Rendering" up to 850 million one-bit pixels/second (35 million 24-bit
       pixels/second, 26 million 32-bit pixels/second), or 50 million Goroud
       shaded pixels/second.  "Rendering" is believed to mean transferring a
       pixel from a frame buffer to the screen.
   - Sprites of "unlimited" size and quantity.  Realistically, sprites can be
       over 1,000 pixels wide/tall, and the number of sprites allowed is
       limited by processor cycles instead of a fixed value in hardware
       (Object processor).
   - Programmable screen resolutions, from 160 to 800 pixels per line.  The
       resolution can be increased even further with additional hardware up to
       a reported 1350 pixels per line.

   One of the Jaguar modes is called "CRY mode", which supports lighting and
   effects in 3D graphics.  Red, green, and blue color elements are ranged
   from 0 to 255, and the lighting level for any pixel can be changed by
   setting one byte linearly.  E.g., the relative proportions of red, blue, 
   and green are indicated with one byte, while a second byte selects an 
   overall intensity of 0 to 255.  CRY allows much smoother shading of single 
   colors, but doesn't allow blending between colors as smoothly.

   Actual graphics performance is hard to measure, as there are no industry-
   standard benchmarks.  Rebellion Software has claimed that the Jaguar can
   render "10,000 Gourard shaded, large, 65536 color, any shape polygons per 
   second," while still performing other tasks.  Presumably this level can
   be increased further with optimized programming.

==============================================================================

Q. How come the Jaguar claims to have "32-bit" graphics, when 16 million
   colors only need 24 bits for rendering?

A. The additional 8-bits is for programmers to implement whatever visual
   effects may be desired.  Examples cited include Z-buffering (for polygon
   graphics) and an alpha channel (for transparency).

==============================================================================

Q. What's the information on the CD-ROM drive?

A. A double-speed CD-ROM drive has been announced for release in 1994, with an
   estimated price of $200.  It is reported that the CD-ROM drive is capable
   of sustained data transfer at 352.8K per second, or run at normal audio
   rates of 175K per second.  Access time is reportedly 210 milliseconds.  The
   CD-ROM drive features a modified data bus interface for access to the Tom
   and Jerry chips almost directly; this allows for a higher throughput rate
   on the sound and graphics.  Storage on a disc is approximately 790
   megabytes (6,320 megabits).  The CD-ROM drive plugs into the Jaguar's
   cartridge slot on top of the machine, and offers a cartridge slot to
   permit playing cartridge or CD games; the cartridge port is accessible
   while using the CD-ROM drive.  CD game information can be saved to an
   optional memory cartridge.

   The Jaguar CD-ROM drive allows delivery of full-screen, full-motion video.
   The CinePak video decompression system has been licensed from SuperMac
   Technologies.  It is a 7K routine in the GPU, and can easily be included
   in any CD-ROM software that wants/needs it.  It allows full-screen video
   playback at 24 frames per second.  Movie quality pictures can then be 
   overlaid on the screen with computer generated graphics if the game 
   demands it.  Time-Warner has licensed a library of film clips from its
   movies to Atari for use in Jaguar games.

   The Jaguar CD-ROM is also designed to interface with audio CD, Karaoke CD,
   and CD+Graphics.  Kodak PhotoCD is an optional feature, and is expected to
   be available as a supplimental cartridge.  The system will not be 3DO
   compatible, but CD-i compatability is being negotiated.  An optional MPEG-1
   (Motion Picture Experts Group) compression cartridge will also be 
   available, to allow users to play full length motion pictures from CD.  It 
   will reportedly include extra RAM for buffering, and support the whitebook 
   video format.  Suggested retail price is $150.

   The Jaguar CD-ROM will have the "Virtual Light Machine" built in.  This
   program will play audio CDs and generate accompanying "psychedelic" color
   and visual effects on the television/monitor.  The player/user can use the
   joypads to modify the patterns.

   The latest release date for the CD-ROM drive is October/November 1994.
   It is being manufactured by Philips in the United States.

==============================================================================

Q. What's this "Panther" I hear about?

A. Quick history lesson: Sometime in the late 1980s, Atari Corp. was doing
   research and development on "next generation" video game consoles.  There
   were two systems, a 32-bit machine called the Panther, and a 64-bit machine
   called the Jaguar.  It is reported that work on the Jaguar was progressing
   better/faster than expected, so Atari abandoned the Panther to focus their
   energies on the Jaguar instead.

   Reports of development work on the Panther have been whispered since 1988;
   some people have erroneously mistaken those rumors to be about the Jaguar.

   The Panther reportedly was considered a "32-bit" machine by Atari, though
   for reasons unknown.  It featured three chips, consisting of a Motorola
   68000 running at 16Mhz, an object processor called the Panther, and an
   Ensoniq sound processor called Otis, featuring 32 sound channels.  The
   Panther could supposedly display 8,192 colors from a palette of 262,144
   colors, and could display 65,535 sprites of any size simultaneously.

==============================================================================

Q. What do I get when I buy a Jaguar?
 
A. The Jaguar package has a suggested retail price of $250, and contains the
   Jaguar itself, one controller, an AC adapter, and the game CYBERMORPH.
   There are rumors that a lower-priced package will be made available,
   without the free game, but that information has not yet been confirmed.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Is there a difference in Jaguar games/units sold in different countries?
   Do I need to keep track of PAL and NTSC versions of a game?

A. There is no difference in the Jaguar game software.  A properly-written
   Jaguar game detects PAL or NTSC at startup and changes the playfield size
   and game speeds accordingly.  A properly-written Jaguar game will run at
   the same speed on either machine.
 
   The Jaguar consoles themselves are configured differently, according to the
   country they are sold in.  The primary differences are in the video output
   format (NTSC or PAL) and the power adapters (110 volt or 220 volt).  For 
   example, to use an American-market Jaguar in Europe, you need a 220 
|  volt-to-110 volt adapter (readily available) and a SCART television set to
|  accept the Jaguar's RGB signals.  Some European TV sets may also require
   changing the Jaguar display from a 60Hz frame rate to 50Hz.
   
   The 50Hz/60Hz frame rate is set by soldering pads on the bottom of the 
   Jaguar PCB.  On an NTSC Jaguar, they're located on the bottom of the PCB
   near the controller ports.  The set labelled "R140" determines between
   50Hz and 60Hz.  Connect the two points for 50Hz, or leave them
   disconnected for 60Hz, as follows:
 
             60Hz          50Hz
              o-o   R135    o-o
              o o   R136    o o   (Information courtesy of Martin Zimmer,
              o o   R137    o o    marz@haari.mayn.sub.de)
              o o   R140    o-o

|  PAL Jaguars sold in Europe have the R140 pads connected with a zero ohm
   SMD resistor, which can be removed with a soldering iron.  It is possible 
   to wire a switch to the points, allowing the Jaguar to be toggled between
|  50Hz/60Hz.  This is mainly useful for PAL Jaguars to play games at the
|  original speed and screen resolution of the NTSC version.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Hey!  My Jaguar makes a quiet hissing sound!  What's going on?  Is it
   dangerous?
 
A. Atari has cited several reasons for the hissing noise.  Some have said that 
   the sound is from the RF generator.  The RF shield has holes in it 
   (ostensibly to help air flow and keep the unit cool), and it is believed 
   that the holes produce the noise.
 
   Others say the sounds are produced by coil L29 which is responsible for the 
   proper voltage regulation to +10.0V, together with U38.  The coil's copper 
   wire vibrates when the current through it changes abruptly, making the hiss.
   There are two solutions: 1) Use plastic spray or silicone rubber glue to 
   fix the coil's wire. 2) Replace the original Jaguar power-supply with a 
   variable power-source, using 7.5V DC instead of 9V DC (it is not certain 
   whether the Jaguar CD will require 9V DC, which would make this "fix" 
   unworkable with the CD drive).
 
   In any case, the "hissing" noise is not dangerous, but merely annoying.  It 
   is usually audible only if you put your ear next to the unit and listen 
   closely, and is not interference in the audio output.
 
   Later Jaguars supposedly do not have this problem.

==============================================================================
 
Q. My Jaguar comes up with a red screen instead of a game!  Is it broken?
 
A. Most often, the "red screen" problem appears after the Jaguar logo has
   disappeared off the TV screen, and is caused by one of the following:
 
   1. Poor contact between the Jaguar and the cartridge (most likely).  Make 
   sure that the cartridge is firmly seated in the cartridge slot, and that 
   contacts are not dirty/dusty.
 
   2. Bent pins in the cartridge slot (rare).  This may be caused by rough 
   edges on some cartridges.  The pins should be carefully straightened.
 
   3. Defective cartridge (rare).  If the red screen only appears with one
   cartridge but not others, the game may be defective.  Exchange it for 
   another.
 
   If the Jaguar logo appears without problems, then the Jaguar is probably 
   working fine, and it's only the data transfer between the unit and the 
   cartridge that's causing the problem.
 
==============================================================================
 
Q. I want something better than RF output from my Jaguar.  What do I do?
 
A. Atari has an S-Video cable and a Composite video cable available for use
   with the Jaguar.  Either cable costs $19.95.

   If you are willing to build your own, the schematics for the expansion port
   are as follows:

Q. How does the ComLynx port on the Jaguar work? Can I connect my Lynx to it?

A. The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
   on the system bus.  An expansion port add-on would make the port
   available, and developers have announced plans for such accessories (see
   below).  It is possible to daisy-chain multiple Jaguars for multiplayer
   games into a "Jaguar network".  In theory, it'd also be possible to connect
   Jaguars and Lynxes, though no plans for cross-system software are in the
   works currently.
 
   There is also talk that the Jaguar's ComLynx signal can allow Lynxes to be
   used as peripherals: software can be developed to allow Lynxes to be part
   of a Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.

Q. What other Jaguar products are worth noting?
 
A: All Systems Go is working on the "Jukebox".  This hardware device plugs in
   to the Jaguar's cartridge port, and holds a number of game cartridges at
   once.  You can then select between them without needing to manually change
   cartridges each time.  Multiple Jukeboxes can be connected to store/select
   more games at once.  Release date is expected to be December 1994, with a
   price of $49.95 for each Jukebox.
 
   All Systems Go also has the "Control Station" in the works.  This device
   plugs into the Jaguar controller ports and allows games to be played by
   infrared remote.  The Station will also allow controller enhancements, such

Q. How is development for the Jaguar done?

A. Jaguar game development environments exist for the Atari TT030 computer or
   an IBM PC/compatible.  Art development can be performed on any machine,
   whether a low-end Apple Macintosh or commercial rendering software such as
   SoftImage.  Wavefront's "GameWare" is the official 2D/3D graphics
   development system; Atari itself uses GameWare for in-company development,
   and registered third-party Jaguar developers can buy GameWare licenses at 
   special discount prices.

   Estimated price for a developer's package is $9,000 for the TT030 setup,
   and $7,500 for the PC/compatible platform.  The package includes a Jaguar
   development unit, documentation, and development/debugging software.
   The Jaguar has modified boot firmware to run the development board (the
   "Alpine board"), and it has a cable coming out to provide signals to the
   Alpine board that are not normally present via the cartridge connector.

   CD-ROM developement packages (including the cartridge development kit) is 
   ranged at about $8,000, and should be upgradeable from the card-only kit.

   Software routines packaged with the system include a multi-channel
   polyphonic FM/Wavetable synth; JPEG decompression; video set-up; drawing
   primitives; 3D rendering with gourad shading, texture mapping, and camera
   manipulation.

   The centerpiece of the TT030 deveopment platform is DB, an assembly-
   language level debugging tool.  The Jaguar and the TT030 are connected with
   a parallel cable, and software can be debugged interactively without
   interfering with the Jaguar's screen display.  DB supports the use of
   scripts and aliases, which simplifies the use of complex or common
   functions.  Also included is a new version of the well-known MAC-65 macro
   assembler for 68000 and RISC code assembly.

   Atari grants final code approval, but does not see the need to "censor"
   games.  Every game is given one man-month of compatibility and quality
   testing before it is approved.  Atari offers technical support via FAX,
   mail, electronic mail and voice.  Atari allows developers to source their
   own cartridges, documentation and shells if desired.  Jaguar software is
   encrypted with a proprietary key, thus preventing unauthorized developers
   from releasing Jaguar software.

   Interested developers should contact Bill Rehbock at (408) 745-2088.
   Include: Company name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, and brief
   company/personal background relating to software development.  Due to the
   high volume of inquires, information kits are prioritized according to
   background (SNES/Genesis/Computer) of previous titles developed.  Atari
   will approve developers only if they are convinced that the developer is 
   serious about releasing software.  After the non-disclosure agreement is 
   signed, an approved developer can get the technical specs alone for $300.
 
   Cross Products (SNASM) offers an alternative Jaguar Development system.  It
   comes with a multiwindowed debugger, assemblers, compilers, and SCSI 
   support, for approximately $3,700.  The package allows for full screen, 
   source level debugging of multiple processors, in C or assembler.  This is 
   only software for the IBM PC; the Jaguar development hardware (Alpine 
   board, modified Jaguar, etc.) must be purchased separately from Atari, for a
   price of $5,500.
