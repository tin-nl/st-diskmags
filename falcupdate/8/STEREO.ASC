STEREO CAD
Object Orientated Stereogram Creator

JCA Europe Limited announce a new program to make your own 3D steregram 
pictures in colour or black & white.

You have seen the posters, you have seen the books you may have even seen 
the videos but now you can create your own 3D Stereograms with Stereo CAD 
for the Atari range of computers.

Some of the facilities offered by Stereo CAD are:

* User definition of three dimensional 'sliced' objects such as spheres,
  pyramids, tubes, stars and prisms

* Standard transformation of shapes (ie. location, scaling and rotation)
  in your scene.

* True scalable, rotatable text and freehand drawings.

* Ability to create stereograms infront or behind the page (cross-eyed or
  parallel techniques).

* Importation of PI1 format pictures for direct conversion to stereogram
  or as a backdrop to 3D object scenes.

* Exportation in PI1 format of finished scene with backdrop if any.

* Exportation in PI1 format of final stereograms for printing.

* User definition of final steregram finish.

* Novice section (Scribble Pad).

STEREO CAD will run on all Atari systems with Colour monitor / TV.
STEREO CAD costs #29.95 including VAT and Delivery within the UK.
