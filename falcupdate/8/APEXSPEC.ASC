APEX MEDIA
A true colour animation & graphic program designed specifically for the Atari Falcon030 using 68030 and 56001 DSP machine code for unparalleled performance.

Originally produced to support the Exposé digitiser, APEX MEDIA has now been expanded to include some of the most amazing features ever seen in any single graphics program. APEX MEDIA represents sheer power for all forms of graphic applications - a performance which has only been seen before on workstations.

For Animation & Morphing, APEX MEDIA excels. The Morphing option provides a superb means to smoothly transform from one image to another while the powerful block functions allow complex animations to be produced quickly and easily - rotation to any angle, proportional re-scale, stretch, skew and mirror across X & Y axes - new images can even be imported from disk and pasted above or below the existing picture.

Post-Processing of animations can be performed using noise reduction, dejagging or motion blur to enable smooth transitions between frames. Advanced Delta compression of the sequence reduces memory and disk overheads, allowing large sequences to be produced on a 4MB Falcon.

The digitising tool allows single or multiple frame capture from moving video in real-time up to 512x320 resolution in 16-bit true colour. Rostrum camera work stretches the system further by providing a 24-bit capture facility.

Special features such as graduated circles, lines, rectangles and interpolative polygons, all drawn in real-time, puts APEX MEDIA head and shoulders above the competition.

For incredible realism, APEX MEDIA supports a true airbrush. This doesn't just place random dots on the screen, but processes the background image to transform the colour being used to produce a graduated spray effect.

Image Processing can be used in real-time for the Post-Production of true colour images to achieve a more natural (or bizarre) effect. Transforms or Masking of certain areas permits hue, saturation and brightness settings to be defined prior to the selected area being painted or filled to the required colour. Analog Transforms and Masks can be used in conjunction with an extensive range of brushes - simply select the function and paint.

The Real-time zoom is available at all times and can even be used during the replay of animations. Every single tool is, naturally, fully usable under zoom conditions, including the realistic airbrush and Image transforms. The ability to draw while moving smoothly around the canvas under zoom mode provides the user with pixel accuracy.

File formats are supported to cover virtually every file type - TGA, GIF, MTV, SPU, JPEG, SEQ, ANM, FLC, DAC, FWR. Existing Atari ST artwork is even supported with the inclusion of PC1 format. Images of any type can also be imported with colour reduction to any number of colours.

Full support is given to VGA and RGB monitors. True colour images can be ‘supersampled’ when using 256 video modes and even 256 colour images can be enhanced within true colour video modes by the use of dithering and supersampling. Large images can even be imported into smaller canvas sizes with the use of fine scaling and the virtual canvas can be reconfigured up to 2048x1024, coupled with smooth scrolling around the image.
