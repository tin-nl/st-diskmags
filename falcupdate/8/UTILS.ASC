Ref: 016
BACKWARD v1.43 is an ST Emulator that lets you select various modes
such as Hard Disk, Timer A or DMA sound, 1 meg memory, 16 or 8mhz
chip, BLiTTER on or off and much more.  It will allow a lot of ST
only games and programs to run on your Falcon and is an essential
utility.  BOOTCONF lets you configure your machine when you boot-up
its very basic and doesn't let you change much only things like Cache
and speaker on\off.  DCSEA 2.0 from Double Click software is a superb
multi-archiver that supports ARC, LZH, ZIP and ZOO formats.  It
creates an executable program that when double-clicked will auto
matically depack the files onto your disk.  DESKPIC will let you load
a GIF file into the background of your desktop (and it can slow
things down a little too!) its quite fun and well written but I often
find it annoying waiting for the picture to be loaded up although
once installed the speed difference is not that noticeable.  FBOOT is
a small util from Sinister Developments that lets you toggle the
cache, speaker, autoboot a disk and bypass hard drive.  It does this
by installing a boot-sector to a floppy disk.  FPATCH1 fixes two
little problems in the Falcon BIOS (TOS 4.00 - 4.04) where the sound
is not initialized properly and the Bconmap doesn't work.  FALCON
SCREEN is a little program that claims to get more from your monitor
resolution wise, from what other people have said it does this very
well but I am yet to use it.  GEMBENCH performs simple benchmark
tests on your computer and compares them with other Atari machines. 
MAGIBOOT is another attempt at an ST Emulator to make those games
work on the 030.  MULTI DIAL is a MultiTOS program (German) to make
those dials fly out all over the place.  MEGA DEPACKER v2.0 is a very
popular depacking program that will recognise most types of ST and
Falcon packer including Automation, Pompey, Ice, Jam and many more. 
A very useful little program indeed.  MTOS_ACC 1.0 by Oliver Scheel
lets you select accessoies with the Control key.  PRIORITY! is
another MultiTOS program that checks which program requires the most
processor time and frees it up for it so it can run faster.  PROCLIST
is a MultiTOS program that displays a list of the processes currently
running.  SPEAKER OFF is a little program to put in your AUTO folder
to turn the internal speaker off upon boot-up.  TTGAMES is another ST
emulator is says to fix some games to work on the Falcon.

Ref: 031
COPY is a little disk copier and formatter that uses an extended
format as standard allowing 1.6meg on a HD disk.  FLI PLAY will play
those 256 colour PC animations in full glory on your Falcon.  See the
demo section for plenty of example FLI files to amaze yourself with. 
HDPATCH is a fix for AHDI.  ICE PACK is version 2.4 and is very
Falcon friendly, get it into action should you wish to pack your
files down and save disk space.  LHARC is the popular method used by
bulletin boards for compressing their files and you will need this to
unpack them all.  MAGIC SHADOW ARCHIVER 2.32 is a special little
program that will pack an entire disk into one single file and vica
versa.  DESKCOPY UTILITIES by Roland Schorr, these MultiTOS utils
include FMT a replacement background disk formatter and diskcopy
utility, NEWCOPY a replace copy, move, rename and trash program. 
TRASHDEL clears the trashcan directory completely (no return!). 
NVRAM CPX will reset the non-volatile memory of your Falcon should
something nasty go wrong with your system.  OUTSIDE DEMO is a virtual
memory program that will enable you up to 52 meg extra memory in this
cut-down demo version.  OVERSCAN will kick your monitor into overscan
mode (RGB only) useful for expanding that desktop.  SENTRY PACKER
2.05 is another file packer with advanced options for pictures and
samples and depack source code for the ICE format.  VRAM is a German
program that claims to be a 'Virtueller Speicher Manager' I am sorry
I don't know what it does, its version 2.57 and I feel it is some
kind of virtual memory manager.  Finally on this disk is ST ZIP 2.3
that famous file packer and depacker, essential, get it now!

Ref: 043
525 is a sample convertor that can handle DVSM, AVR, SND, AU, WAV and
RAW data samples.  BURP! is a little GEM hack that makes your screen
bounce up and down no matter what you are doing (ie playing a game or
drawing a picture), quite sickening!  CHKDISK3 is a utility that
analyzes a disk's file structure and does all necessary fixes but
take a back-up of important data first.  DIVINE is a demo version of
a new art package that looks like Neochrome on the Falcon.  DSP
PLAYER is a modules player that uses the DSP instead of the 68030. 
It works well and runs as a TTP.  EDISON is a multi-function
ACCessory that speeds up your mouse, configures key cliks and such
and also has a screen saver built in that works in all Falcon
resolutions.  FALCON SCREEN 5 the latest version of this screen
enhancer, use at your own risk.  LAMEMINE is a version of the Windows
classic but bigger and better!  MARIO is a funny little affair where
you control what looks like a womble in a go-cart around this very
SNES Mode 7 type course, no time limit, plenty of other drivers, no
collision, looks fun!  MINI LEDGER v3.3 is a powerful new
computerized financial accountant.  Having done accounts for a year
and learning double entry, VAT, Factory accouts, etc.. I can vouch
for the quality of this program.  You have a 15 record limit on this
version.  ML-PLAY V0.02 is a straight-thru sample player (ie plug a
sound source into your microphone socket) and the results come out as
your work on the desktop.  PLASMA1 is a new version of the classic
BSS plasma demo (rgb only).  PLAYMAN is a little ACCEssory that lets
you play modules from the desktop.  MODUL-PLAYER v3.42 is a nice
production from Channel-38 that plays modules at a good quality with
a nice demo-screen style playback screen.  PROTRACKER is the complete
module editing, creation, playback suite and comes with two sample
modules provided.  Its a very good program, is RGB and VGA and plays
all known modules types from the Amiga.  PRO PLAYER is yet another
module player ACCessory, try them all and take your pick of the best
one you want!  QAD 3D VGA is a little demo by Percy of Light that
lets you control a massive shaded vector on-screen, it is a spinning
top shape so you can spin it and watch the colours rotate!  nice, VGA
only.  SLIDEMOD is the TGA slideshow program used to great effect in
our raytraced demos in the graphics section of this PDL.  SPERM is a
starfield with a novel twist to it!  SPIRIT EDITOR 1.3 is a desktop
ACCessory text editor.  Finally are some technical documents about
the Falcon's hardware registers.

Ref: 055
BACKWARD 2.24 the famous ST Emulator expands even further, pretty
much the same options but a better interface and you can save special
configuration files for disks you use a lot.  BMAPFIX 2.0 by Don
Maple fixes an error in the serial ports of your Falcon.  CLOCK 2.0
is a desktop ACCessory that runs in a borderless window and displays
the time using a standard clock face, it can handle analog, analog
with digital date or a whole variation on those themes.  ECOPY 1.5 is
a very impressive disk copying utility that can handle most format
types and has a very friendly interface and front-end (VGA
recommended).  It's very German but shouldn't be too hard to get
along with for the seasoned FCopy user in the past.  There are also a
multitude of special utils that come with Ecopy including Icons,
CPX's, Cookies and more.  F CONTROL 1.0 is another Falcon
configuration program that lets you toggle bell, key click, speaker,
hard drive, blitter and cache.  German.  MASTER BROWSE 3.2 is an
impressive text displaying program with facilities for multiple
documents open in windows, block cut and paste and extensive GDOS,
Neodesk, Terradesk, Gemini and MultiTOS support.  REZ FOOLER 1.2 is a
program that will try and fool your Falcon into thinking it has a
different type of monitor hanging off its ports than the one it
really does have, should enable some RGB-VGA programs to work on your
machine.  SWITCH is a little program that will switch your IDE drive
on or off.  XMENU is a superb little util that lets you make a menu
for your hard drive and run programs from it instead of from the
desktop, saves time if they are all over the place.

Ref: 059
BACKWARD 2.41 this ST Emulator gets updated with an amazing
regularity and seeing as its a very important program that all Falcon
owners should have I think you ought to get this upgrade now before
they update it again!  CLOE is a demo of a raytracing package, choose
some objects, sit back and wait... and wait... and wait!  CPX's there
are 14 new CPX modules for the XControl Panel, they are BIORYTHM'S,
BOOTREG, CALLFSEL, DRUCKER, D_FREE, HD_FREE, HORPUZZ, MASTERMIND,
MONOLUPE, PUZZLE, SCOOK211, SOLITARE, SPOOLCPX and TELEINX.  More d2d
programs surface with DAME the newest of the bunch, dame is a Digital
Audio Multilayering & Editing program.  You load it, you look at the
screen display, you think 'YIKES!' what on earth?!  It's big and
nasty and if someone would like to write a tutorial for it I would be
happy.  VGA recommended.  JML SNAP 3.10 as far as I can tell
(extensive docs - in German) is a snapshot program that saves out as
IFF, (X)IMG and TIFF.  BRAINSTORM FLI\FLC MOVIE PLAYER is a desktop
animation player, it runs under Gem, TOS and MultiTOS, will run in
any resolution, is AES colour friendly (no screwy desktop after
running an animation) and movies can be re-sized as they play so you
could have an animation running in the background of your desktop! 
It runs as an ACCessory and I didn't have too much luck with it, it
never seemed to like the FLI files I game it to play, however others
swear by it.  Trial and error I guess.  PIXART is a demo version of
the new art program for the Falcon, its a very clip-arty type program
but it has some very interesting effects such as scrunch, ball wrap
and more.  Lots of file formats supported.  Good demo to see if the
original from ST Club is worth buying!  REST PAL is a little util
that will re-set the Falcon palette after a nasty little program has
mucked it all up (only about 50% success though, maybe I am running
it wrong?).  XGA - SPECTRUM 512 a nice picture convertor, turn a 512
picture into an XGA picture, shame it doesn't work in reverse.

REF 121 : A massive bunch of Falcon utilities including..................
......... ARROWFIX v1.5 is a small CPX that patches a bug in GEM's scroll-
routine present in TOS 1.04 - TOS 4.04.  BLITZSCHNELL is a hard disk drive
defragmentation and optimisation program, its shareware so you should send
the money required if you use it often.  It provides you with a graphical
representation of your disk.  A detailed manual is included.
BINARIS VIEWER 2.0 is a program or accessory GIF and TARGA image viewer that
only runs in True Colour mode.  It also has in-built conversion features and
is surprisingly fast indeed.  It can only handle GIF87a or TGA type 2 but 
you can pack them with Atomik 3.5 or Speedpacker 3 so you can save a lot of
disk space too.  DCLOCK 1.0 is a desktop clock program with a difference!
The numbers are digital, huge (indeed they take up a fair chunk of your screen
even on a VGA) and the numbers can be made to do alsorts of special effects
like morph into each other, scroll around, shrink, etc... clever but slows
down your Falcon when you boot-up.  DIAMONDS is a little 'just for fun' kind
of program that is a variation on the 'life' program in which you can see
your colonies expand and die, its all very colourful, a little useless but
rather interesting.  FALCVOLU is a small program you stick in your AUTO folder
that will turn the volume down to 0 every time you reset your machine.
FUZZYCLOCK 1.14 is my favourite desktop clock, it doesn't try anything fancy
with graphics or take up any desktop space at all, instead it sits quite
comfortably on your menu bar line right at the far end and displays the time
in writing (ie 5 past 9).  It doesn't eat much memory, works fine with every
program I've got and I think its great!  GFAINI03 seems to be some kind of
patch for the Falcon libraries for GFA Basic, docs are in German.  GHOSTLINK
is an amazing program to say the least, it allows you to connect a PC via a
null modem cable and run it as a slave machine, so you can access the hard
drive, cd-rom, etc...  it works brilliantly, is very fast (up to 115,000 baud)
and lets you link up to three PC's like this.  PC software is supplied also.
Wonderful, just wonderful!  GRABBER 1.00 from Terrosaur Systems is a desktop
accessory designed to grab a specified amount of ram and release it later,
this is useful for MultiTOS applications that are memory hungry.
ICDRAW 1.41 is an icon editor for the Falcon030 by Dr. Bob and has some very
amusing doc files to accompany it!  This is the best icon editor I have seen
on the Falcon, you can import Windows icons, edit your existing RSC file and
increase it from 32 icons to up to 199 icons, you can design them for 16, 4
or 2 colour desktop's.  You can save them out and you can even animate them
(although its rather basic).  I recommend this one very much, register it now!
KMTERM is the only ST comms package (shareware one) that works on the Falcon.
MORPHDEM is a fix for the Black Scorpion Software morphing demo so it now
works on VGA monitors.  PRGFLAGS is a small utility to set the flags in 
program headers to make your program 'fastload'.  PS CONTROL v1.5 is very
German, runs as an ACC or PRG for MiNT and I really don't know what it does,
help anyone?  RATEEHD was developed by ICD Inc to test the speed of their
hard drives and it can do the same for you, putting your drive through a
rigourous test and giving a transfer speed at the end of it.  RDE v5.0 is a
very clever reset-proof ram disk that is 100% Falcon compatible.  Assign your
ram disk to a drive letter and you can have it automatically installed when
you boot-up your machine.  You can even save the entire contents of the ram
disk to a file then restore them again on boot-up.  A very useful little util.
SHBUF v1.3 is a patch program for the NEWDESK.INF file although what it
patches I am now quite sure as its all in German again.  SND2STE is another
patch for the Falcon, this time it patches the DMA sound to make it emulate
an STE, this is the most friendly version and I have had no problems with it
at all.  SND THRU will take the sound coming into the Falcon and replay it via
the speakers with no visable slow down of the machine, a very friendly program
that even lets you turn it off again.  SURROUND is a LOD module for WinRec 
that emulates surround sound in a very basic form, I hijacked my sisters hi-fi
and I can tell you that if you have the right equipment it actually works very
well indeed.  VIBRAX is another module player, this time by Patrick Ruiz, it
works with NVDI, BlowUP and ScreenBlaster and plays modules.  The replay 
routine works quite well with _most_ module formats (4 channel only) but has
a nasty bug that *sometimes* messes up the keyboard.

Ref: 130
ANCIENT ART OF ASCII will take a PI3 picture and turn it into an ASCII file!
It works well (sometimes) but obviously depends on the subject matter.  DSP
BINDINGS for HiSoft's Lattice C 5.5.  ACE_FIX will make the game Steel Talons
work from a joystick instead of a joypad.  RUN_VGA will fix the morphing demo
from Black Scorpion Software to work on a VGA monitor.  MORPH8.TGZ is a new
picture for the morphing animation which on some versions was corrupt.
NVDI_FIX changes NVDI 2.50 so that it works with EasyDraw and any other 
program that opens up a virtual workstation with normalised device coords.
ZIP24FIX will make ST ZIP v2.4 not take 5 seconds every time you load it up.
GAPOSCAN 1.0 from Gary Priest will make your RGB or TV go into Overscan mode,
which is a maximum resolution of 768x480.  GEMAR 1.22 is a SCSI Tape Streamer
program which has extensive (German) documentation.  HAPPY FACE 2 will put a
cute smiley face on your disk's bootsector to show there is no virus there.
JPEG GVS is a save module for Gem View so you can save out JPEG pictures.
TURBO PACKER Plus from Wolfgang Mayerle is a new packer program that will
compress data and executable files by a large amount and very quickly.  A
depacker is also supplied.  TRANSLATOR is a German to English translation
program and it works very well indeed, it has a ready made library of commonly
used Atari words and phrases so should do a good job on those German doc files
you havn't been able to understand.  XTASK by Gary Priest is for running
under MultiTOS and will provide a graphical front-end for controlling running
processes.  SYNERGY DEPACKER 2.2 will depack plenty of common ST packer file
formats including Automation, Pompey, Ice, Sentry etc...  a useful program
if you have some files you want to convert to the Falcon that are ST packed.

Ref: 136
ALBION  is a program that will change those non-standard characters  you 
sometimes get in filenames,  you can place them or remove them however I 
am yet to get it to work.   EGALE will compare the contents of two ascii 
or  binary files,  much like the DOS command.   HOW FAST will  rate  the 
speed  of  your  hard drive and give you the data in  a  nice  graphical 
display.   NEODESK  4  is  a fully working demo of  this  brilliant  GEM 
replacement.   STOOP is the most essential program a Falcon owner should 
have in the AUTO folder.  just like Superboot but much much better  with 
full ACC and PRG configuration,  set up auto-boot buttons and much more.  
Brilliant,  shareware.   ST ZIP v2.6 is the nice new looking version  of 
this  popular archiving package.   TOS4TRAP will trap a few bugs in  the 
OS, only trouble is I don't know which ones!

Ref: 139
CIXCOMM is a brilliant off-line reader for use on the Compu$erve system. 
GHOST  LINK will link your Falcon and PC for ultra=quick  data  transfer 
and drive sharing.   STORM is a fully featured comms package,  ideal for 
getting on-line with.   UUENCODE is a UUencoding and UUdecoding  package 
for sending files via electronic mail.   VANTERM is a Falcon  compatible 
version of this popular beginner comms package.

Ref: 144
This disk contains - AUDIO CALC for calculating the timing required  for 
recording equipment.   BOOTCONF UK,  sets your NVRAM and now has English 
docs.   FREE  will  reset your NVRAM to the  original  English  settings 
incase you accidently set it to something it doesn't like.   GEMRAM will 
load  Gem  into memory for programs like Winx.   WINX (!) is  a  desktop 
enhancer,  it  lets  your  mouse have more control over  the  files  and 
windows  it is accessing,  place windows off the left hand side  of  the 
screen  and much more,  very recommended.   OCR is a  Shareware  Optical 
Character  Recognition  program for use with hand  scanners  where  text 
heavy documents are involved.   GSPOOL32 is a fast printer spooler  from 
the  author of ICDRAWUP.   LEDPANEL is a novelty program that  places  a 
small  status  bar on the top right of your screen which  shows  when  a 
drive  is  being  read  from  or  written  to.    INSTALL  is  a  custom 
installation program,  just place all your ZIP files in a folder and put 
INSTALL  on  the root directory and it will unzip them  all  into  their 
respective places,  quite handy!   CHK APP is a small program that  lets 
you  check whether a commercial application will work on the  Falcon  or 
not,  includes  over 250 details and updated on a  regular  basis,  just 
enter the application name and away it scans.   LETEMFLY adds those  fly 
dials  to window dialogue boxes and finally PROFILE will do  a  complete 
run down of your entire system set-up.
