The Barracuda will be Available at the end of February, Cost when equipped
with the 68040 33MHz with FPU "Floating Point Unit" is MSRP $950.00. It is
being released with 2 VME expansion slots and a 50 Pin Video Port. The Ram
Card MSRP is $300.00 and the 486DX33 PC card will be MSRP $400.00. The
additional cards will be available in March 95 and April 95. We have just 
went
to Fabrication this week on the Cuda 040, now it's up to the PC house,
Assembly and Parts distrubitors. During current BETA V.5 all software 
seems to
work Great, No More BUGS...we hope

The Barracuda is a computer inside a computer, the 486DX will require the
Barracuda as well as the memory expansion card. The 486 uses 32 Bit local ram
for it's operation. Hope that answers your question.

 The Barracuda Works with Cubase in accelerated mode, on the PC side Windows
for workgroups runs fine, however so far no midi support.

 All you need is your basic Falcon, the Barracuda040 and a place such as the
Falcon Rack to place it all in. The stock Atari case/power supply just don't
cut it.

Although the CUDA is somwhat expensive compared to some other 
accelerators, it
is much more. We have extended the Video on the Falcon to 1280 by 1024 2
color. We speed up the DMA access, added 2 VME 96 pin slots for 
Expansion, as
well as a EXTERNAL video expansion port for (the Video Funnel, and the VES
2000 3000 and 5000 ) Video editing systems, expected to be released by June
95. So far the most recient delays have been caused by software bug that we
have been fixing, I believe we have them all corrected now, Release time
should be February 28, 1995. We are attending NAMM January 20 through 23 and
hope to be ready to show it there. By the way the machines timming is better
now than ever before, because we now control most of it. Almost any ATARI
(HACKER) user can install the CUDA themselves with little Tecnical knowledge,
most of it os plug and play. oh yea and pulling out 5 PALS (that are 
socketed)
2 wires to solder, 5 if you take advantage of the video enhancement.
