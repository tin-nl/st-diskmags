Atari to expand Jaguar peripherals
 
SUNNYVALE, Calif. - Jan. 6, 1995 - New peripherals in 1995 are a key part of
the system expansion plans for the 64-bit Jaguar Interactive Multimedia
system, Atari Corporation today announced. "Since Jaguar has already made the
leap to 64-bit technology, we can focus on providing even more value to
consumers by expanding the system with new and innovative peripherals," said
Sam Tramiel, CEO of Atari Corporation. "By the end of the year, players will
link multiple systems, play each other over the phone and venture into new
virtual reality environments with their Jaguar systems."
 
Networking Jaguar systems through use of the Jag Link cable enables the
playing of network compatible Jaguar games on different systems up to 100 feet
away from each other. The Jag Link cable system can support at least two
simultaneous game players at once, depending on the software. The system uses
standard RJ11 phone line cable to link two Jaguar interactive game systems and
implements reliable differential pair technology. The Jag Link cable is
expected to be available for sale in the second quarter of 1995 at a suggested
retail price of $29.99.
 
The Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator allows players to link to each other over
the phone. The new technology, developed with Phylon Communications, Inc.,
leaders in the fax/modem/voice technology field, not only permits two players
to play against each other using the phone connection, but to speak with each
other by using a headset. By utilizing a "call waiting" feature, users can
also pause a game to answer a phone call. The Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator
comes complete with a stereo headset and is expected to be available by the
third quarter 1995 at a suggested retail price of less than $150.
 
Also planned for 1995 delivery is Atari's virtual reality headset, now under
development with Virtuality Group plc, the leader in virtual reality
technology and arcade games. The two companies officially joined forces in
October to create the world's first immersive virtual reality games for the
home market.
 
The virtual reality headset should be available to consumers by Christmas 1995
with a targeted price of less than $200.
 
Atari Corporation markets interactive multimedia entertainment systems,
including Jaguar, the world's first and only 64-bit game system, and the only
video game system manufactured in the United States. Atari is headquartered at
1196 Borregas Avenue, Sunnyvale, California 94089.
