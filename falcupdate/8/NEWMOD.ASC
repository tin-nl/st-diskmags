Hello! do you love soundtrack MODs? Do you have an Atari STe,TT or a Falcon?
So, you will sure be interested with the news I'm bringing to you:
CPU_MODA.PRG is a NEW 4-channels MOD-player to read and listen your favourite
MODs. But why should you be interested? well I give more details.
- very short program (less then 11Ko program and not even compressed).
- it owns all the effects of the MODs (TIMER,RANDOM,...)
- it has been optimized
- it is a rethinked algorithm (entirely original)
- the quality hasn't be beaten for now (try it, you'll agree).
- the source is reusable and can be called in any program (calls commented)
- it needs only the space of the module +70Ko.
- it can be installed as .ACC (background music) .GTP (application) or .PRG
- it offers a CDplayer interface with pleasant shortcuts.
- it includes details on all the parameters for the MODs-effects.

Where can you find it?
at the ftp.cnam.fr server under the name:
Falcon/Music/cpumodf3.lzh for Falcon
Music/cpumodst.lzh for STe & TT
