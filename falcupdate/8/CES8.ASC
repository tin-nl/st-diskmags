 'Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars(TM)' Previews at the Winter
  Consumer Electronics Show
 
 LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6 -- Today at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show,
 Time Warner Interactive, Inc., Games Division announced the preview of
 "Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars(TM)" on the Sega(TM) Genesis at
 the St. Tropez hotel in suite 2903. Time Warner Interactive has an
 exclusive three-year, multi-platform license with Wayne Gretzky,
 all-time NHL scoring leader and four time Stanley Cup winner.
 Additionally, a license was signed with The National Hockey League
 Players' Association (NHLPA) to provide the games with real player
 names, profiles and statistics. "Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA
 All-Stars" captures the realism of hockey by using advanced 3D imaging
 of real players' motions, by building the gaming engine on
 professional hockey players' profiles and statistics, and by using the
 talents of sports game specialists to design the game. The first
 product in the line will be developed for the Sega Genesis and is
 expected to ship in April 1995 for an estimated street price of
 $54.95.
 
 "We're putting together a powerhouse hockey game with the competitive
 features that will please veteran hockey fans and will have new
 initiates in the game immediately," commented Mark Beaumont, Senior
 Vice President Product Development and Marketing at Time Warner
 Interactive, Games Division. "We have a lot of experience creating
 sports titles such as the all-time best selling baseball video game,
 'R.B.I. Baseball, ' and creation of the unprecedented 3D rotating
 court in 'Dick Vitale's "Awesome Baby" College Hoops.' The sports
 market is very competitive -- we're going for winners, by pulling
 together the best technology, licenses, and talent."
 
 "Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars" features actual NHLPA players
 from 26 North American teams and 6 International All-Star teams. Real
 player statistics and profiles are supplied by the NHLPA and updated
 annually. With over 600 professional hockey players and all their
 stats you have the talent at your disposal to compete and go for the
 cup. The battery back-up feature tracks your wins, stats, penalties,
 and injuries and lets you trade players, edit team line-ups and names,
 from game to game so you can play a full 84 game season with playoffs.
 
 "Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars" looks and plays realistically
 because professional gameplay was captured on video and in 3D rendered
 animations. The title features film footage of NHLPA players in
 critical moments like face-offs, blocks and goal scoring. To capture
 the real movements and character of Wayne Gretzky, Gretzky himself is
 filmed for CD versions while wearing a special suit inlaid with light
 sensors. Gretzky's actions are recorded with the light sensors and
 then used to create a basic character outline or animated "skeleton"
 on the computer. A graphics art package is used to then render the
 animated hockey player; skating, passing, blocking, and scoring just
 like the "Great One."
 
 "Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars" puts the player on the ice and
 in the action. With only three pushes of a button you can be playing
 hockey! You have two styles of play: "Simulation," which operates
 under real rules, or "Arcade" mode, a more rough and tumble version in
 which "street" rules are the name of the game.
 
 Draft some buddies with a four-player accessory to the Genesis or mix
 in professional muscle with real player profiles and teams to play a
 game of hockey that will get your heart pumping and puck flying.
 Check out the action in "Practice" mode where you can play a regular
 game, shoot-out, or team of choice without the pressure of winning for
 tournament ranking. If you've got the stuff -- go for "Tournament"
 play and compete with the pros, playing through a season, a
 professional best of 7, an All-Star tournament or All-Team tournament.
 Have it your way with the "Just Play" mode. It's an intelligent
 "no-brainer" function that automatically customizes the game, set-up,
 options and competition based on your history of preferences,
 abilities, and hockey style.
 
 The look of the game has a lot of thought and detail. The player
 animations are 20% larger than images in competitive hockey games.
 The user can get right into the game because of the unique
 close-to-the-action perspective -- your view is at center rink, right
 on the edge of the ice -- so you'll be right there for full screen
 face-offs and all the plays. Referees appear in video with digitized
 audio announcing penalties and goals. Details such as backwards
 skating action and the sounds of puck slaps and stadium music add to
 the realism.
