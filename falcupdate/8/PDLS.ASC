Do you run a public domain and shareware library?  If so then why not 
swap adverts with us, in exchange for a ASCII advert published each month 
in  our  Falcon disk magazine - FALCON UPDATE - all we ask  is  that  you 
place  our  ASCII advert for the Falcon Owners Group  within  the  Falcon 
section of your disk catalogue.   It's as simple as that, your advert can 
be  as long as you like (up to 10k maximum) and include features such  as 
an order form or small section of your PD library listing.

All  it will take is for you to send it to us on disk  (preferably  along 
with the rest of your catalogue) and place the FOG_INFO.ASC file on  your 
catalogue in exchange.
