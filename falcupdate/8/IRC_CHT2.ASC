(#4,Karega) a question about...
(#4,Karega) the new Jag2 that is supposed...
(#4,Karega) to be out...
(#4,Karega) can you give us any info onthatGA
(#33,RB-Atari) Ron, who is this directed to?

(#1,Ron Luks (SYSOP)) Ron B-- take it.
(#33,RB-Atari) There are a lot of great things our R&D department are working on. 
(#33,RB-Atari) I think most of us know that Jag 2 is a very real one that we are looking at.
(#33,RB-Atari) We have a long way to go to exploit the power of the Jaguar we know today,
(#33,RB-Atari) but we will announce new products as soon as we can.

  Cyrus Lendvay (51)

(#33,RB-Atari) "Regular" computer games are not compatible on the Jaguar so we can
(#33,RB-Atari) "unleash" 64-bit power! <g>
(#33,RB-Atari) GA
(#1,Ron Luks (SYSOP)) GA Cyrus.
(#51,Cyrus Lendvay) Are there any easter eggs in AVP??
(#51,Cyrus Lendvay) If so, what are they??  :-)

  Brian (20)

(#20,Brian) Hi, I heard you made a contract with Sega..
(#20,Brian) that you'll share infos...
(#20,Brian) Does this mean only technical stuffs or...
(#20,Brian) games too?
(#20,Brian) GA
(#33,RB-Atari) I understand that there are up to 5 games per year... the technical stuff
(#33,RB-Atari) is mostly existing material from the older systems. The data share does
(#33,RB-Atari) not regard Jaguar or Lynx specific secrets.

  Jay (27)

(#27,Jay) hi
(#27,Jay) The Jag 64 bit Jag.....
(#27,Jay) is the processer and machine itself......
(#27,Jay) 64 bit, and plays 64 bit games.......
(#27,Jay) or is it 32bit machine playing 64bit games?
(#27,Jay) ga
(#33,RB-Atari) The Jaguar has TWO CPUs that are 64 bit and 5 total. The system addresses
(#33,RB-Atari) memory in 64-bit chunks and information travels on 64-bit highway...\
(#33,RB-Atari) It IS a 64-bit machine. Correction: 3 of the 5 are 64-bit.

  Bob Vila! (72)

(#72,Bob Vila!) Hi guys...
(#38,AVP Design Team) Purple - before just now, only two people had that info... :)
(#38,AVP Design Team) ga
(#72,Bob Vila!) My question concerns 3rd party deveopers...
(#72,Bob Vila!) and quality control...
(#72,Bob Vila!) Is there any?...
(#72,Bob Vila!) Meaning: Can just anyone develop a game for the Jag...?
(#72,Bob Vila!) And when's Primal Rage And Assault due to be released?
(#72,Bob Vila!) GA
(#33,RB-Atari) YES, anyone can develop, BUT they have to meet minimal technical qualifications.
(#38,AVP Design Team) James - and they have to be registered devlopers
(#38,AVP Design Team) ga
(#33,RB-Atari) In other words, we do not steer potential developers away UNLEss the softwa
(#33,RB-Atari) Right, to become registered means they meeat minimal qualifications, but we
(#33,RB-Atari) welcome all developers. Primal Rage has been announced recently by Bill Rehbock,
(#33,RB-Atari) we have not gotten a target release date yet. Assault is by Midnite and we hope
(#33,RB-Atari) to see it 1st quarter.

(#47,Mr. Vedder) Hello
(#47,Mr. Vedder) Why is it so hard to find a Jag in stores?  GA
(#33,RB-Atari) In some areas it may be. We are constantly expanding the number of storess
(#33,RB-Atari) we are in. You will notice in my introductory text that we are in ventures
