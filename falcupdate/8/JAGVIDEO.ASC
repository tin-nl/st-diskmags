 >>> JAGUAR VIDEO <<<

 Atari has a brand new VHS preview tape and it's better than
 ever! Over 30 Jaguar titles have been captured on video
 tape and just in time for the Holidays. This tape has been
 meticulously produced under the direction of Mr. Greg
 LaBrec using state-of-the-art direct-to-tape equipment and
 techniques. The action sequences selected were provided
 by the game producers or the guidance of the third party
 developers. Okay, okay... forget the hype... it's a darn
 cool tape and it has a cool plastic box and label too.
 
 This new edition updates the previously released software
 preview videos with exciting captures to show off last
 minute changes to games that are now in production. There
 are incredible sequences featuring action games such as
 Iron Soldier and high-resolution fantasy games such as
 Rayman by ubi Soft.
 
 Although this tape has been developed primarily for the use
 of Jaguar retailers, I have twisted marketings arm and
 they (actually he) has finally allowed me to sell copies to
 our faithful online Jaguar fans. I told him how everyone
 wants to see what has been taking so long. I mentioned that
 gamers want a good preview of things they are being asked
 to spend $50 to $70 on. I assured him people want an update
 of what has been going on in the past few months since CES.
 Now he's convinced and I have to sell more than three tapes
 fast or he'll never believe me again. <g>

 Personally, I'm going to have my tape signed by Greg
 LaBrec. If you want him to sign your copy, let me know and
 I'll see if I can catch him in a good mood for you! <g>
 
 I also have Alien Vs. Predator posters remaining. There is
 one for each shipping and handling fee of $4.95 ($6.95 in
 Canada). These are cinema-size posters and I've already
 heard back from gamers who have had theirs laminated,
 mounted and framed.
 
 By the way, you can help a LOT even if you don't want to
 order the tape or request a poster by passing this offer
 electronically to another Forum, Roundtable or BBS or make
 a hard copy and give to friends. Thanks!
