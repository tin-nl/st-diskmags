 ATARI JOINS FORCES WITH VIRTUALITY
 TO OFFER HOME VIRTUAL REALITY GAMES BY CHRISTMAS 1995
 
      SUNNYVALE, CA (October 25, 1994) -- Atari Corporation
 (AMEX:ATC), the name that created the video game industry, has joined
 forces with Virtuality Group plc, the leader in virtual reality
 technology and arcade games, to create the world's first immersive
 virtual reality games for the home market.
 
     According to the just signed agreement, Virtuality will finalize
 development of a consumer version of its head mounted display
 technology (virtual reality headset) that Atari will manufacture and
 market for use with the Atari Jaguar 64-bit multimedia home
 entertainment system. Terms of the agreement call for Atari to
 contribute toward the development cost and pay a license to
 Virtuality to produce and market the product. The virtual reality
 headset will be available to consumers by Christmas 1995 with a
 targeted price of less than $200.
 
     "The Atari Jaguar platform is the only 64-bit system currently on
 the market and is ideally suited for immersive, virtual reality
 games," said Jon Waldern, chief executive officer of Virtuality.
 "This deal propels both companies to the forefront in the home market
 for virtual reality gaming. Thanks to the Atari Jaguar, fans of our
 many hit arcade titles will soon be able to play their favorite
 virtual reality games at home."
 
     Atari President Sam Tramiel explained that both Atari and
 Virtuality have worldwide reputations for offering the most advanced
 gaming technology and performance. "Combining Virtuality's ability to
 deliver low cost solutions for virtual reality technology
 applications with the processing power capabilities of the 64-bit
 Atari Jaguar will result in a very high quality virtual reality
 experience at a very affordable price," he said.
 
     Tramiel added, "By Christmas 1995, Jaguar owners will already be
 wearing their virtual reality headsets and playing virtual reality
 games at home. While others in the industry play catch up trying to
 offer 32 and 64-bit systems, Atari is extending our technological
 advantage over our competitors by delivering a high-quality virtual
 reality experience."
 
     Atari Corporation markets interactive multimedia entertainment
 systems, including Jaguar, the world's only 64-bit game system, and
 the only video game system manufactured in the United States.
 
     Virtuality Group plc is the world leader in the design of high
 quality virtual reality technology, arcade gaming systems and
 software.
