MAITLAND, FLA. Nov. 14, 1994 - Time Warner Cable's Full Service
Network (FSN) President Tom Feige and Atari Corp.'s CEO Sam Tramiel
announced Monday an agreement to offer Atari's Jaguar 64-bit
interactive video games on demand to FSN customers.
 
Jaguar, the world's first and only 64-bit interactive game system
features high-speed animation, textured three-dimensional color images
and graphics, and CD-quality sound.
 
Consumers will access the Atari games on the Full Service Network
using the 64-bit Jaguar game system device, which processes more than
100 times as much data at one time than 16-bit games, and twice as
much as 32-bit game systems. This significantly increases speed and
lets game players experience superior graphic performance and
animation action. Through the Full Service Network, the Atari games
are digitally compressed and stored on magnetic hard drives, and
downloaded to the game device at the consumers' request.
 
In addition, using a Hewlett Packard DeskJet 550C printer, consumers
will be able to print out game instructions with full-color graphics.
Approximately 30 Atari Jaguar game titles will be available on the
Full Service Network next year.
 
"We're proud to offer consumers games on demand from Atari Jaguar
because it's the most advanced and powerful game system available
today, " said Full Service Network President Tom Feige. "When we
compared the graphics and capabilities of the game systems on the
market, Atari Jaguar was the clear choice for us."
 
"Time Warner Cable's Full Service Network is the network of the
future, " said Atari President and CEO Sam Tramiel. "Atari's Jaguar
system brings the most sophisticated hardware and games to the
network. We are proud that Time Warner picked Atari Jaguar for the
Full Service Network."
 
Since its release in November 1993, Atari's Jaguar game system has
been named the industry's "Best New Game System" by Video Games
Magazine, "Best New Hardware System" by Game Informer, and "1993
Technical Achievement of the Year" by DieHard GameFan. Jaguar is the
only video game system manufactured in the United States.
 
Time Warner Cable is the nation's second largest cable television
operator with 7.3 million customers in 34 states, and serves more than
500,000 customers in its Florida division.
 
Time Warner Cable's Full Service Network is a digital, interactive
television network which merges cable, computer, and telephone
technologies to provide customers greater choice, control, and
convenience in accessing information and services.
 
Atari Corp. markets interactive multimedia entertainment systems,
including Jaguar, the world's only 64-bit game system, and the only
