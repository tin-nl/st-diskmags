Atari announces winning line-up of Jaguar titles for first half of 1995
 
SUNNYVALE, Calif. - Jan. 6, 1995 - By this summer, fans of the first and only
64-bit game system in the world will have more than 50 games to choose from,
including dozens of brand new Jaguar game titles.
 
"Alien vs. Predator, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Kasumi Ninja, Iron Soldier and
Tempest 2000 were the top-rated Jaguar titles for 1994," said Sam Tramiel,
president and CEO of Atari Corporation. "In the first half of 1995, we expect
many hit titles, including Fight for Life, Space War 2000, Hover Strike, Ultra
Vortex and Rayman. These and other titles will substantially increase the
Jaguar library." Below are descriptions of these upcoming hits:
 
Fight for Life: This 3-D fighting game, produced and published by Atari, is
set in hell, with each character striving for the ultimate prize: the chance
to gain redemption and live again. Players choose one fighter from among eight
different characters. They then battle the remaining characters one-by-one and
proceed to the final showdown with the end boss. As they defeat each opponent,
players can select up to two of each character's five special moves, in effect
creating their own truly unique fighting character. (Do the math: The
possibilities are endless.)
 
To create 3-D animation of unsurpassed fluidity and realism, the production
team used state-of-the-art motion capture technology that incorporated the
movements of live martial arts experts performing nearly 200 different moves.
Artists then exploited the Jaguar's 64-bit system to create stunning 3-D
graphics that bring the characters to life. According to Edge Magazine
(December 1994), "The skyline background looks impressive and the moves are
well-animated." "Atari's Fight for Life puts a floating camera around the 3-D
fighting. Jaguar owners will soon have a 3-D fighting game to call their own,"
remarked a reviewer at GamePro (January 1995).
 
Space War 2000: In their intergalactic jousts, space knights vie for old-
fashioned glory, honor, fame and fortune.  As they emerge victorious from each
battle, they procure such weapons as laser shots, missiles, shields and
cloaking devices. This first-person perspective 3-D adventure, produced by
Atari, is fun for single players and spectacular as a two-player game. "First-
person gaming is reaching a new high, and Space War 2000 is positioning to be
a contender in that wild and crowded race," stated a reviewer at EGM2 (January
1995).
 
Hover Strike: The mission: To lead the rebels in an attempt to vanquish the
formidable Space Pirates from the planet. The weapon: A high speed hover tank
armed with rapid fire cannons, powerful missiles, on board radar and
protective shields. This game, published by Atari, uses the Jaguar's 64-bit
technology to deliver an action-packed, fully texture-mapped, first-person
perspective 3-D battle. Ken Williams of Electronic Gaming Monthly says, "The
first-person perspective serves this game well, adding a new dimension to the
genre."
 
Ultra Vortex: In this game, produced by Beyond Games, players test their
fighting skills in a nether world tournament. They can choose among eight
valiant fighters from different dimensions before the final battle with the
evil entity. Amazing sounds and graphics inspired a game reviewer from
Electronic Gaming Monthly to write, "Ultra Vortex will make some people stop
and turn their heads."
 
Rayman: Ten-year old Jimmy creates a stunning imaginary kingdom called
"Hereitscool" in his computer and transforms himself into Rayman, a fantasy
hero who combats the forces of evil to save his friends. Here's what DieHard
GameFan had to say about this winning title from UBI Soft: "Absolutely
brilliant looking. The control is perfect and the artwork is phenomenal."
