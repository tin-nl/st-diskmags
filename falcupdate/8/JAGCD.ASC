Well the February issue of Gamepro has the JagCD ad in it...and guess what
in big white numbers it says $149.00.  So now we know the price "for sure"
and it has some really nice shots of games that look incredibly nice like
Creature shock and Battlemorph.

Anyways here's what it says in Big Bold crazy drawn letters:

The Most powerful game system in the world just got a 790 Meg Tune-Up.

The following two paragraphs read:

	How can we possibly make the 64-bit Jaguar more powerful? Attach an
Atari double-speed CD player.  It's a lot like attaching an atom bomb to an
F-14.  We're talking explosive power that no other CD-ROM combination can
match.  Just piggyback this 790-meg monster onto your Jaguar and watch your
TV come alive with insane true color, movie like images and CD quality 
stereo sound.   (Me: Why not surround??)

	If our interactive CD games don't rearrange your brain cells, the
built in Virtual Light Machine will.  Throw on your favorite CD, and watch
the music morph, contort, and pulsate in a psychedelic light show your ex-
hippie parents may even appreciate.  So check out the new CD player for the
Jaguar.  It'll crank the torque up to nuclear proportions.


VLM description: Watch the beats of your CD's come to life in a pulsating 
collage of 65,000 mind blowing colors.  Or create your own cosmic light show
at the toouch of a button.


Peace.
