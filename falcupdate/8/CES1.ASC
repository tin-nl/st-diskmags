Coming attractions for Atari Jaguar
 
SUNNYVALE, Calif. - Jan. 6, 1995 - Batman Forever, Thea Realm Fighters and
Primal Rage top the list of coming attractions for the 64-bit Atari Jaguar
Interactive Multimedia system in 1995.
 
"The focus at Atari for 1995 is great software and lots of it," said Sam
Tramiel, CEO of Atari Corporation. "We are working with over 200 developers to
bring a wide variety of new games to the 64-bit Atari Jaguar in 1995. The
powerful Jaguar technology can handle popular arcade games like Primal Rage or
provide the speed and graphics necessary for brand new games like Batman
Forever and Thea Realm Fighters."
 
Batman Forever, based on the much-anticipated Warner Bros. movie scheduled for
release this summer, pits the caped crusader and his sidekick Robin against
Gotham City villains Two-Face and the Riddler. The Atari Jaguar Batman Forever
game will incorporate the movie's characters and feature the films newly-
designed costumes and high-tech equipment.
 
Market research demonstrates that over 90% of the U.S. population is familiar
with the Batman character, so there will be wide appeal for the game. Batman
Forever is scheduled for delivery to stores late in the 3rd quarter.
 
Thea Realm Fighters combines the latest digital motion capture technology and
nationally known martial arts fighters, including several used for both Mortal
Kombat games, to create a super-realistic fighting game.  Among the well-known
martial artists used for the game are:
 
[] Ho Sung Pak, who played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat I & II, is a member of
the Black Belt Hall of Fame and winner of the Grand Slam of Martial Arts in
1991, and served as technical advisor for choreography.
 
[] Phillip Ahn, MD, is a 4th degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do.  Dr. Ahn played
Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat II.
 
[] Katalin Zamiar played Kitana, Mileena and Jade in Mortal Kombat II. Katalin
is a black belt in Okinawan style Karate.
 
[] Daniel Pesina, who played Johnny Cage and the ninjas in Mortal Kombat I &
II, is a nationally ranked martial artist in forms and weapons.
 
There are a total of 25-plus characters to compete against in Thea Realm
Fighters, including twelve main characters and twelve other special
characters. The characters can compete in four different modes and with more
than 30 different backgrounds, creating a wide variety of combat situations
and scenarios. The release of Thea Realm Fighters is planned for the 3rd
quarter.
 
Primal Rage pits seven different prehistoric creatures -- each with its own
unique fighting style -- against each other in a battle for world domination.
This one or two player game was a huge hit in the video arcade market last
year. Time Warner Interactive plans to ship a compact disc version of Primal
Rage in the 4th quarter.
 
Atari Corporation markets interactive multimedia entertainment systems,
including Jaguar, the world's first and only 64-bit game system, and the only
video game system manufactured in the United States. Atari is headquartered at
