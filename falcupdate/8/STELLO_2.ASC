Hello everybody.

Stello 2.0 othello is out with features such as

 - Works under Gem,  all Atari computers,  all screen  resolutions,  (x
   resolution must be at least 640).
 - Supports Multitos and WINX.
 - Uses multitasking under Multitos.
 - Advanced  gameplaying  algoritms,   alfa-beta   minimax,   iterative
   deepening,  response  killer  table,  saves game tree and  uses  the
   zerowidth minimax modifikation.
 - One of the best Othello programs in the world.
 - Background pictures on the board as black/white or color.
 - RSC files in english, german, french and danish.
 - Dialogs in windows.
 - Nice  interface  (3d  buttons  and checkboxes  even  under  old  tos
   versions, niceline menus, animation of disc's).
 - Printing of moves,  board and transscript as ASCII,  GDOS or  Speedo
   GDOS.
 - Export of moves,  board and transcript as ASCII or META  file.  This
   means  that  you can take the output and use it in  a  wordprocessor
   that  supports import of META files.
 - You  can  set the size of the output,  (boardsize of 4 -  16  cm)  2
   types  of transcript,  (with or without disc's) and turn on/off  the
   border text (abcdefgh, 12345678)
 - There  is a (very primitive) fontselector,  and you can  choose  the
   output device (printer from 21-30 and meta file from 31-40)
 - Context sensitive help with St-Guide.

New in Stello 2.0

This  is  a major update.  Here is a list of the  most  important
improvements.

 - I  have  implemented  the zero-width  minimax  modification  in  the
   normal alfa-beta search, which means 10 % fewer nodes to examine.
 - The "brain" has been much improved,  which means that it now gives a
   more accurate and stable evaluation of the positions.
 - Endgame search now 10% faster. (16000-23000 moves/sec on a TT)
 - Special  endgame  search mode where Stello can search for  a  "Win",
   "Win/Draw" or "Max disc".  The "Win" search is 10-50 faster than the
   "Max disc" search, and in extreme cases up to 200 times faster.
 - Stello now evaluates its commandline,  so you can drag games to  its
   Icon,  and it will then load it,  and you can install Stello with  a
   DOC type of "GAM",  so it will start and load a game if you click on
   it.
 - Stello now also supports the drag & drop protocol under Multitos.
 - The  filename  is displayed in the game window so you can  see  what
   game you have loaded.
 - Manual input of games is now completely mouse controlled.
 - GDOS and Speedo GDOS is now supported.  This means very nice  output
   via  printer  and META file.  If you don't have GDOS you  can  still
   print and export as ASCII.
 - Window with transcript of game.
 - Context sensitive helpfile for St-Guide.
 - various  bugfixes (It should now finally be possible to  load  games
   and pictures on TOS 1.0 and TOS 1.2)
