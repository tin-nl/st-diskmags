(#33,RB-Atari)  Hello! (from Ron Beltramo, v.p. marketing)
(#33,RB-Atari)  I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.
(#33,RB-Atari)  Please accept my thanks for joining us this evening. I am
(#33,RB-Atari)  aware that everyone would enjoy having conferences more
(#33,RB-Atari)  frequently and we will review opportunities for more
(#33,RB-Atari)  conferences in the future. As you might imagine, we have
(#33,RB-Atari)  been working hard on getting more software for the Jaguar
(#33,RB-Atari)  on the market as quickly as possible. In itself, that would
(#33,RB-Atari)  not be hard if speed was our only concern. By reviewing the
(#33,RB-Atari)  message threads forwarded to me and the results of focus
(#33,RB-Atari)  groups and retailer feedback we are convinced that you want
(#33,RB-Atari)  the type of quality software that features the most
(#33,RB-Atari)  immersive and challenging gameplay that can be created for
(#33,RB-Atari)  the 64-Bit Jaguar system. With that in mind, we have been
(#33,RB-Atari)  firm in our resolve to create a new caliber of quality
(#33,RB-Atari)  software. The feedback we are receiving on Alien Vs.
(#33,RB-Atari)  Predator, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Tempest 2000 tells me
(#33,RB-Atari)  we are on the right track. As we have all discovered, being
(#33,RB-Atari)  patient and committed to this standard of quality pays off.
(#33,RB-Atari)  This is turning out to be an exciting Holiday Season. As
(#33,RB-Atari)  many of you know, we have started to ship Dragon: The Bruce
(#33,RB-Atari)  Lee Story and Doom. We are shipping these titles as quickly
(#33,RB-Atari)  as they come in to us, so make sure you stay in touch with
(#33,RB-Atari)  your retailer if you are looking for these titles. On the
(#33,RB-Atari)  heels of these titles are Checkered Flag, Club Drive, Iron
(#33,RB-Atari)  Soldier, Val D'Isere Skiing, Bubsy, Zool 2 and Kasumi
(#33,RB-Atari)  Ninja. Look for a fast flurry of these titles within the
(#33,RB-Atari)  next few weeks. I am particularly excited about the
(#33,RB-Atari)  diversity of these titles as well as quality. I think this
(#33,RB-Atari)  Christmas, there is something for everyone on the Jaguar.
(#33,RB-Atari)  This special conference is in the honor of the hard work
(#33,RB-Atari)  put forth by the AvP team with their successful release of
(#33,RB-Atari)  their new hit. I know people would like some updated
(#33,RB-Atari)  marketing scoop, so maybe I can address that topic quickly
(#33,RB-Atari)  before turning the entire focus to them.
(#33,RB-Atari)  First off, we are wrapping up some studio production work
(#33,RB-Atari)  for three new television commercials: one featuring Kasumi
(#33,RB-Atari)  Ninja, one for Doom and one for Iron Soldier. The Doom spot
(#33,RB-Atari)  will be finished this week and be on air next week for a
(#33,RB-Atari)  three week blitz leading up to the Christmas holidays. Iron
(#33,RB-Atari)  Soldier and Kasumi Ninja will be completed next week and on
(#33,RB-Atari)  air going into the new year. All three are shaping up to
(#33,RB-Atari)  be great ads for three of the next great Jaguar titles.
(#33,RB-Atari)  Those of you who live near Venture Stores (a chain very
(#33,RB-Atari)  similar to Target with stores mostly in the midwest) have
(#33,RB-Atari)  seen their promotion of the Jaguar in recent circulars. The
(#33,RB-Atari)  Jaguar and the Lynx have also been featured in recent
(#33,RB-Atari)  Incredible Universe advertisements. We have also succeeded
(#33,RB-Atari)  in selling an impressive number of Lynx systems on the Home
(#33,RB-Atari)  Shopping Club. Toys R Us has expanded the distribution of
(#33,RB-Atari)  Jaguar to 300 stores accross the country. Jaguar is now
(#33,RB-Atari)  being launched into Japan and every Toys R Us Store in
(#33,RB-Atari)  Japan will be carrying the Jaguar this Holiday Season.
(#33,RB-Atari)  Bill Rehbock, v.p. of software business development, has
(#33,RB-Atari)  recently revealed that Primal Rage will be coming to the
(#33,RB-Atari)  Jaguar although the timing for release has not yet been
(#33,RB-Atari)  announced.
(#33,RB-Atari)  The long awaited Tempest 2000 Soundtrack on compact disc is
(#33,RB-Atari)  expected in our warehouse within the next 10 days. I think
(#33,RB-Atari)  this item makes a perfect Christmas gift at only $12.99
(#33,RB-Atari)  plus shipping. Contact Don Thomas, director of customer
(#33,RB-Atari)  service to order. He tells me he has reduced the shipping
(#33,RB-Atari)  and handling to just $3.50 on this item for onliners.
(#33,RB-Atari)  The Alien Vs. Predator cinema-quality poster has been such
(#33,RB-Atari)  a hit, we have brought in more. As a matter of fact,
(#33,RB-Atari)  EVERYONE that attends this conference tonight live can
(#33,RB-Atari)  receive a postage paid free AvP poster. The SysOp will keep
(#33,RB-Atari)  track of who attends. You must send your U.S. or Canadian
(#33,RB-Atari)  mailing address privately to 75300,1267 to get your poster.
(#33,RB-Atari)  If you are reading this text after the conference has
(#33,RB-Atari)  concluded, you can still obtain a free poster, however,
(#33,RB-Atari)  Atari's minimum $4.95 shipping and handling fee applies.
(#33,RB-Atari)  The most recent edition of the retailer's Jaguar demo tape
(#33,RB-Atari)  is reaching stores now. Some of you have ordered one for
(#33,RB-Atari)  yourselves and are receiving them. I hope you will feel
(#33,RB-Atari)  free to loan that tape out to friends. <hint> This 40+
(#33,RB-Atari)  minute tape was produced by Greg LaBrec, director of
(#33,RB-Atari)  creative services. It features 30 Jaguar game sequences
(#33,RB-Atari)  plus copies of Atari's Jaguar commercials INCLUDING the
(#33,RB-Atari)  popular AvP spot; all professionally edited, reproduced
(#33,RB-Atari)  and labeled. (Greg has been known to sign a few before they
(#33,RB-Atari)  are shipped upon request <g>)
