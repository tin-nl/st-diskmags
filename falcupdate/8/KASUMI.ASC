 The Unofficial Kasumi Ninja FAQ v.9.1.2

Q. What is Kasumi Ninja?

A. Kasumi Ninja is the first announced fighting game being released for the
Atari Jaguar 64 Bit Multimedia System.  Its expected release date is
sometime early to mid November.  The game is being developed by Handmade
Software (based in the U.K.) for Atari Corp.  It will also be the first
4Meg (32 megabit) cart released for the Jaguar.

Q. What is "special" about KN?

A. KN represents the first Digitized fighting game to rival/exceed the
visuals, violence and gameplay of the Mortal Kombat series of arcade games
on the Atari Jaguar.  By using the Jaguar's advanced graphic and sound
capabilities, KN should be the first true "arcade" quality fighting game
available on the Jaguar.  One other note is about the violence in this
game.  This will undoubtedly be if not the bloodiest then one of the
bloodiest games in or out of the arcade.  To this end, Atari will be
voluntarily placing a warning on the outside and the inside of the game
package.  

NOTE:  There will be a "gore" setting whereby the player can easily turn on
and off the gore in the options menu.  Atari will have a "lock-out"
mechanism to censor the blood and fatalities for concerned parents.  This
mechanism will be a parent programmable password that can be entered and
changed to enable or disable the "gore" mode.

Q.  How does the gameplay work?

A.  Like in most fighting games, it is a tournament format where a player
fights one of the other characters which is being played by either the
computer or another human player.   Each fighter has special moves specific
to him/her in addition to basic moves that all characters can do.  The
"life gauge" is a large samurai sword upon which blood accumulates the more
the character is hit.  Blood periodically drips to the floor and stays
there throughout the round.  Needless to say, all blows by an opponent
cause massive amounts of blood to fly.  The game begins in a labyrinth
(with full 360 degree control and floors and ceilings) where each player
selects their fighter.  In a one player game the player also chooses his
opponent at this point.  During this whole process there is great music
playing.  Once both characters are selected, a door opens and players can
run down the hall to their fighting area.  The background for the battle is
determined by who is the second player.  Ted Taquechi has said the maze
part of the game will play a larger role in the game.  You will receive
keys for each opponent you defeat.  Also, your character will gain some of
your opponents powers after you defeat them.   Having all of the keys will
allow you exit the labyrinth... provided you can find it (and defeat the
Master Boss).

NOTE: While in "blood/gore" mode, blood does not disappear five seconds
after it hits the ground as in MK... it stays there until at least the end
of the round, staining the floor.  This may or may not change in the final
version.  Also, there is a "secret" TURBO MODE that will run at 60 frames
per second for faster/smoother action!  As I understand it this TURBO MODE
was not shown at the SCES.  The version shown on 6/25-26 at the Summer
Consumer Electronics show was v .32 so it's still early.

Q. Who are the Characters and What is the Storyline?

A.  The story takes place on the small island of Kasumi in the West
Pacific Rim. For many generations, the island has been the source of
some of the greatest Ninja Warriors. The existence of the island and
its inhabitants is a secret, and the secrecy has been maintained with
the help of the Ninja Gods. An invisibility mist shrouds the island,
making it undetectable, even by modern technology such as satellites
and radar. The Ninja Gods ensure that no ships find it by diverting
their course.

Recently, one of the eldest Ninjas, Gyaku, went berserk and killed all
of the other elders on the island. It is said that Gyaku is possessed
by spirits from the Demon World. Now, the Evil Ninja Gyaku has
proclaimed himself Lord of Kasumi Island.

The Ninja Gods have chosen you, a neophyte Ninja, to defeat Gyaku and
re-claim the Dragon Cloud Temple, where Gyaku is planning his
overthrow of the Island. The Dragon Cloud temple is said to have a
portal to the Demon World, and with such awesome power, Gyaku could
not only rule Kasumi Island, but he could very well rule the world.

The Gods cannot help you directly, but they can help you as the Ninja
to gain more confidence and skill. This is done by your Ninja
character assuming the persona of a great fighter from one of the
world's fighting races. Fighting as all of the characters, and
defeating all of the different characters will prepare you for your
final confrontation with Gyaku.

Eventually, you must find your way through the Labyrinth beneath the
Dragon Cloud Temple, and defeat Gyaku. Before you do that, defeated
opponents will each give you clues and items to help you find your way
through the maze. Then, via the underground Labyrinth, you must find
your way to the Portal. The way will be dangerous, but with the help
of the Ninja Gods, you can make it to face Gyaku, and destroy him
before he unleashes his Demon Minions.


While moving through the underground labyrinth, there are many items that
you will find that will make your journey easier.  Many are essential to
the completion of your quest.  They are:

THE ORB OF ILLUMINATION:  lights the way for the player in the dark
labyrinth

THE CRYSTAL OF GUIDANCE:  aids the player in finding his way to the Ninja
Lord Gyaku’s temple.

THE PSYCHIC JEWEL:  allows the players to focus their mental energy into a
beam that will smash down walls.

THE SHIELD GEM:  places an aura around the player to protect him from a
certain amount of damage while wandering in the labyrinth.

CRYSTAL KEYS:  these keys unlock the many doors that Gyaku has sealed to
impede the players progress.  They are in the maze itself.

THE DETECTION RUBY:  Finds traps for the player.

QUARTZ RODS:  recharges “the Orb of Illumination”

        The reason the Ninja Gods have chosen Alaric, King of the
Goths, is well known. Alaric was one of history's most feared and
ferocious fighters. Alaric helped to bring down the mighty Roman
Empire, and conquered great portions of Central Europe. Alaric is
feared, because he possesses an exploding Bamboo Stick which he found
in battle. Alaric uses this Bamboo Stick to keep his people loyal, as
well as to defend himself.

Lunging Punch, Bamboo Projectile?

DEATH MOVE:Historically, the Goths used to trade with the Japanese 
      for "exploding bamboo sticks" (analogous to today's Dynamite!).  
      The Goth's fatality involves the Goth shoving a lit "bamboo stick"
      partially down the throat of the opposing fighter where it then 
      explodes, blowing the head and torso of the opposing fighter     
      right off.  Meat and blood fly EVERYWHERE!

        Now living on the island of Mazos near Somothrace. Thundra is

bolas that has proven to be deadly in combat, and, through
elimination, made her the leader of her gang.

//// Pakawa: The Comanche Indian Warrior\\\\

Tu-Wee-Kah. The Tu-Wee-Kah were equivalent to the Greet Berets in
their time. They were the ones that were sent in first, to stealthily
attack the opposition, and disable key warriors. The rest of the tribe

Q. What sort of backgrounds will there be?

A. There was one background made for each of the characters.  Each of the
photo-realistic backgrounds will have some sort of moving element and
multiple layers of paralax scrolling.  One of the more “pre-viewed”
backgrounds involves some sort of golden Oriental Dragon/Dog statues
situated in a sort of temple.  These dragons will have glowing red eyes,
smoking nostrils and multiple layers of paralax scrolling.  The Native
American's background is an Indian Reservation with a beautiful mountain
scene with Teepees, horses and campfires (which are animated).  There is
also a "canyon" background for one of the fighters and another "oriental"
background that was nicer than the dragon/dogs background as well.  All
backgrounds will have some sort of moving element.  One of the more notible
parts of the background are the floors, which are comprised of many, many
small polygons.  These polys provide a “tiled” appearance on many of the
backgrounds and is visually stunning.
