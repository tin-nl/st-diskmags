'Power Drive Rally' and 'Striker '95' Preview at the Winter Consumer
 Electronics Show
 
LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6 -- Today at the Consumer Electronics Show, Time Warner
Interactive, Inc., Games Division announced the preview of two popular titles
developed by Rage Software of the U.K. "Power Drive Rally," a fiery car racing
game, takes you on the international touring circuit in search of competitive
times, major prize money, and increasingly sleeker racing machines. A hit on
the Super Nintendo Entertainment System(R), Time Warner Interactive is
previewing a new version for the Atari(TM) Jaguar(TM). The second Rage title
is "Striker '95," a fast-action soccer game known for the authenticity of its
player movements and responsive controls. The U.S. version will feature a new
element of game-play with an intriguing management strategy option. "Striker
'95" is under development for the IBM(R) PC and compatible systems on CD-ROM
and diskette formats. Both titles are being shown at the St. Tropez hotel in
Time Warner Interactive's suite 2903.
 
"We're excited about working with Rage Software and licensing two titles with
a proven track record. Both sold very well in Europe and should have a strong
following in the U.S. because of their competitive feature-sets, and the
popularity of both sports," said Mark Beaumont, Senior Vice President Product
Development and Marketing, Time Warner Interactive, Games Division.
 
'Power Drive Rally'
 
Take part in the international car racing scene with "Power Drive Rally."
Contestants are on their own to purchase cars, go up against the competition,
maintain and upgrade their vehicles and compete for prize money. Test your
racing skills in three areas: road rallies where you compete against computer
opponents over mixed terrain including mud, gravel, and asphalt courses; time
trials for flat out speed challenges; and obstacle courses with cones, curves
and a sinister slalom. There are over 50 tracks that will take you through the
world's deserts, mountains, and beach courses in all kinds of tricky weather
conditions including ice, snow, and rain. Realistic graphics promise details
such as shadows, dust clouds, skid marks, brake lights, and exhaust plumes
which makes your maneuvers around hazardous bends and competitors all the more
gripping. As you progress through the game you will hone your racing skills
and win money to invest in new equipment and vehicles. There are six cars and
each handles in a slightly different manner with unique cornering,
acceleration, and road handling capabilities. Power Drive Rally is expected in
May 1995 on the Atari Jaguar and will be available at retail outlets.
 
'Striker '95'
 
"Striker '95," an internationally popular soccer game, is now moving to the
U.S. with a more powerful software engine, robust graphics in 256 SVGA color,
zoom-in camera shots and a genuine stadium atmosphere. This sports game
features fluid, rotoscoped player animations running at 10 frames per second
and improved artificial intelligence for better playability resulting in a
game with realistic action. Options include eight different formations, each
available with a choice of six team strategies, plus you can select from eight
different ball control methods including: passing, normal and overhead kicks,
standing, jumping, and diving headers as well as chesting the ball down.
"Striker '95" also offers a big new challenge -- you'll not only play a fast
paced, no holds barred game of soccer but you'll also manage the team. This
strategy option has you building up cash reserves to buy hot talent, trading
players, dealing with injuries, and having a word or two with the referee.
"Striker '95" has an expected ship date of April 1995 and an estimated street
price of $49.95.
