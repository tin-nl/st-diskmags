overdrive.
 
Atari Corporation Friday announced that its new compact disc multimedia
peripheral will be available in the first quarter, priced at an amazingly

The powerful double speed Jaguar CD player incorporates incredibly fast access
speed for smoother game play and its massive data capacity provides better
graphical detail, expanded plot lines and more characters, which all add up to

are 81 different pattern settings available on the VLM. The VLM is built into
the Jaguar CD Multimedia player.
