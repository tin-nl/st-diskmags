The FAQ is growing and growing as i included the game info's,
so i maybe have to rename this list (it was never a real FAQ).

Will this list ever be complete ? ATARI users sucks a lot,
cause i only got a handful of replies to this list.
So if you got this list, please repost to me, and only
if you say that this FAQ is the best thing you ever read :-)

Also i'm still searching for a Falcon user with an normal VGA-Monitor,  
to test the demos on this kind of monitor.  

Well and nobody wants to add something or have any ideas to include.
But if you have one please mail it to me.
For every new entry please use, as i will do it, the news marker '|'  
in the front of the line, like in this old example :

[...]

Name: Are U Experienced
Group: E.K.O. (Extremly Kriminal Organisation)
Creds: Maxx Out, Magie X,  
Type: Demo
| Out: 28-08-94
Filename: ARE_YOU.
| Monitor-Type: RGB(but not in 640x400)/MVGA(not)/VGA(not)
Exit: Soft Reset
Time-Length:
File-Length:

[...]

So if U want to look up what's new in the FAQ, just search with your
text-editor for |'s :-)

Many Demo-Groups / Coders are now coding on games, so i included some
game previews or games that will be available for the Falcon 030 only
or you can play on the Falcon 030. So this list will be enlarged to
a list that will include all enjoyable programs for your Falcon 030.

============================================================================

Changes to 0.nû: After hours and days of demo-watching/testing
                 i added 5 more demos, all Time-length and all
                 File-length, i have not used any | markers, cause
                 each demo has new adds.
Changes to 1.0 : 5 new demos
Changes to 1.1 : 1 demo / 3 game previes
Changes to 1.2 : deleted the version number, now i only use the date.
                 added 6 demos (in two month, i think i missed some)
                 and some games/previews
Changes to 18.12.94: Well only three demos entered the FAQ (but FB3 is ahead:)
Changes to 12.02.95: Included four new demos and the game/prev/demo list

Further improvement:-More Demos/Games of course
                    -Well maybe i include the Texts of Scrollers,...
                     if there is demand for it, so if U want to have it
                     tell me.
                    -Maybe i include the greetings of each demo too
                    -then the VGA compatibility will be included
                    -a full description of the demo (i'll rip some text's
                     out of disk-mags :-)
                    -IMHO: i will briefly give you my opinion of the demo

Next FAQ release : after the Fried Bits III with many new and good demos/games
                     
Demos missing : i found some demos in Stallions List :
                Extro-Demo by Extract (EXTRO.PRG)

Every Demolist-Entry consists of:

Name :  Name of the Demo/Dentro/Shortro/One Screen/...
Group:  Name of the Demo-Crew/Company/...
Creds:  Name of the Coder/GFX/MSX/...
Type :  Type of the Demo, please help me to name a correct definition
Out  :  release date of the demo ...
        DD-MM-JJ
Filename: Name of the archive or filename
Monitor-Type: on what monitor is the demo running
        RGB (well i tested it on a normal Sony TV via SCART)
        MVGA (MultiSync NEC 3D)
        VGA (see text above)
        ST Low (on all kind of monitors)
        special (only runs on the given screen-size)
Exit: How to exit the demo.
        (good) no probs with the DESKTOP, maybe probs with other prg's
        (sufficient) some probs with the DESkTOp, but its still running
        (worse) it quits, but in an unuseful DESKTOP, so U have to reset
        Space - just press the Space Bar or maybe another key
        ESC - hmmm i think that i don't have to explain it
        Reset-Button - well this special button
        Soft-Reset - U can reset with a normal ALT-CNTR-Del
                     (usefull for Tower-user)
        Auto - the exits automatically
Time-Length: how long is the demo running
        time - until its autoexits, or nothing more happens,
               the scroller ends or wrap. Its min:secs (but seconds
               are only counted every 15 secs, so U have 15-30-45-00)
        optional - the demo wraps and repeats, so U decide the end
                   mainly used for One Screen demos !
File-Length: normal length of the packed archive (extracted file/foulder)
        Most PRG/TOS are extracted, even if they were packed with sentry,
        Atomic, ICE, or any other packer (and of course if i have the  
        depacker :-). Because they are now faster to load from Harddisk  
        (i have enough space :) and they can now better be packed with  
        Lharc or STZip, so its cheaper to upload or download them !!!  
        But if U want to U can pack them again, no one will stop U ;-)
Special: all that should be additional known about the demo.
