* This is a complete (and official) run down of the GIF file format,  ok
so it is to be replaced with the more  versatile  PNG  format,  but  its
still invaluable reading for anyone wanting to write a  Falcon  graphics
package.  Apologies for the bad layout, its just the way it arrived.
I have also added the cover sheet about the GIF 89a format at the end.

INTRODUCTION

        'GIF' (tm) is CompuServe's standard for defining generalized  color

   raster   images.    This   'Graphics  Interchange  Format'  (tm)  allows

   high-quality, high-resolution graphics to be displayed on a  variety  of

   graphics  hardware  and is intended as an exchange and display mechanism

   for graphics images.  The image format described  in  this  document  is

   designed  to  support  current  and  future image technology and will in

   addition serve as a basis for future CompuServe graphics products.

        The main focus  of  this  document  is  to  provide  the  technical

   information  necessary  for  a  programmer to implement GIF encoders and

   decoders.  As such, some assumptions are made as to terminology relavent

   to graphics and programming in general.

        The first section of this document describes the  GIF  data  format

   and its components and applies to all GIF decoders, either as standalone

   programs or as part of  a  communications  package.   Appendix  B  is  a

   section  relavent to decoders that are part of a communications software

   package and describes the protocol requirements for entering and exiting

   GIF mode, and responding to host interrogations.  A glossary in Appendix

   A defines some of the terminology used in  this  document.   Appendix  C

   gives  a  detailed  explanation  of  how  the  graphics  image itself is

   packaged as a series of data bytes.

 GIF SIGNATURE

        The following GIF Signature identifies  the  data  following  as  a

   valid GIF image stream.  It consists of the following six characters:

             G I F 8 7 a

        The last three characters '87a' may be viewed as a  version  number

   for  this  particular  GIF  definition  and will be used in general as a

   reference  in  documents  regarding  GIF  that   address   any   version

   dependencies.

 SCREEN DESCRIPTOR

        The Screen Descriptor describes the overall parameters for all  GIF

   images  following.  It defines the overall dimensions of the image space

   or logical screen required, the existance of color mapping  information,

   background  screen color, and color depth information.  This information

   is stored in a series of 8-bit bytes as described below.

              bits

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  Byte #

        +---------------+

        |               |  1

        +-Screen Width -+      Raster width in pixels (LSB first)

        |               |  2

        +---------------+

        |               |  3

        +-Screen Height-+      Raster height in pixels (LSB first)

        |               |  4

        +-+-----+-+-----+      M = 1, Global color map follows Descriptor

        |M|  cr |0|pixel|  5   cr+1 = # bits of color resolution

        +-+-----+-+-----+      pixel+1 = # bits/pixel in image

        |   background  |  6   background=Color index of screen background

        +---------------+          (color is defined from the Global color

        |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|  7        map or default map if none specified)

        +---------------+

        The logical screen width and height can both  be  larger  than  the

   physical  display.   How  images  larger  than  the physical display are

   handled is implementation dependent and can take advantage  of  hardware

   characteristics  (e.g.   Macintosh scrolling windows).  Otherwise images

   can be clipped to the edges of the display.

        The value of 'pixel' also defines  the  maximum  number  of  colors

   within  an  image.   The  range  of  values  for 'pixel' is 0 to 7 which

   represents 1 to 8 bits.  This translates to a range of 2 (B & W) to  256

   colors.   Bit  3 of word 5 is reserved for future definition and must be

   zero.

 GLOBAL COLOR MAP

        The Global Color Map is optional but recommended for  images  where

   accurate color rendition is desired.  The existence of this color map is

   indicated in the 'M' field of byte 5 of the Screen Descriptor.  A  color

   map  can  also  be associated with each image in a GIF file as described

   later.  However this  global  map  will  normally  be  used  because  of

   hardware  restrictions  in equipment available today.  In the individual

   Image Descriptors the 'M' flag will normally be  zero.   If  the  Global

   Color  Map  is  present,  it's definition immediately follows the Screen

   Descriptor.   The  number  of  color  map  entries  following  a  Screen

   Descriptor  is equal to 2**(# bits per pixel), where each entry consists

   of three byte values representing the relative intensities of red, green

   and blue respectively.  The structure of the Color Map block is:

              bits

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  Byte #

        +---------------+

        | red intensity |  1    Red value for color index 0

        +---------------+

        |green intensity|  2    Green value for color index 0

        +---------------+

        | blue intensity|  3    Blue value for color index 0

        +---------------+

        | red intensity |  4    Red value for color index 1

        +---------------+

        |green intensity|  5    Green value for color index 1

        +---------------+

        | blue intensity|  6    Blue value for color index 1

        +---------------+

        :               :       (Continues for remaining colors)

        Each image pixel value received will be displayed according to  its

   closest match with an available color of the display based on this color

   map.  The color components represent a fractional intensity  value  from

   none  (0)  to  full (255).  White would be represented as (255,255,255),

   black as (0,0,0) and medium yellow as (180,180,0).  For display, if  the

   device  supports fewer than 8 bits per color component, the higher order

   bits of each component are used.  In the creation of  a  GIF  color  map

   entry  with  hardware  supporting  fewer  than 8 bits per component, the

   component values for the hardware  should  be  converted  to  the  8-bit

   format with the following calculation:

        <map_value> = <component_value>*255/(2**<nbits> -1)

        This assures accurate translation of colors for all  displays.   In

   the  cases  of  creating  GIF images from hardware without color palette

   capability, a fixed palette should be created  based  on  the  available

   display  colors for that hardware.  If no Global Color Map is indicated,

   a default color map is generated internally  which  maps  each  possible

   incoming  color  index to the same hardware color index modulo <n> where

   <n> is the number of available hardware colors.

 IMAGE DESCRIPTOR

        The Image Descriptor defines the actual placement  and  extents  of

   the  following  image within the space defined in the Screen Descriptor.

   Also defined are flags to indicate the presence of a local color  lookup

   map, and to define the pixel display sequence.  Each Image Descriptor is

   introduced by an image separator  character.   The  role  of  the  Image

   Separator  is simply to provide a synchronization character to introduce

   an Image Descriptor.  This is desirable if a GIF file happens to contain

   more  than  one  image.   This  character  is defined as 0x2C hex or ','

   (comma).  When this character is encountered between images,  the  Image

   Descriptor will follow immediately.

        Any characters encountered between the end of a previous image  and

   the image separator character are to be ignored.  This allows future GIF

   enhancements to be present in newer image formats and yet ignored safely

   by older software decoders.

                                pixel+1 - # bits per pixel for this image

        The specifications for the image position and size must be confined

   to  the  dimensions defined by the Screen Descriptor.  On the other hand

   it is not necessary that the image fill the entire screen defined.

 LOCAL COLOR MAP

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)                                    Page 7

Specification

        A Local Color Map is optional and defined here for future use.   If

   the  'M' bit of byte 10 of the Image Descriptor is set, then a color map

   follows the Image Descriptor that applies only to the  following  image.

   At the end of the image, the color map will revert to that defined after

   the Screen Descriptor.  Note that the 'pixel' field of byte  10  of  the

   Image  Descriptor  is used only if a Local Color Map is indicated.  This

   defines the parameters not only for the image pixel size, but determines

   the  number  of color map entries that follow.  The bits per pixel value

   will also revert to the value specified in the  Screen  Descriptor  when

   processing of the image is complete.

 RASTER DATA

        The format of the actual image is defined as the  series  of  pixel

   color  index  values that make up the image.  The pixels are stored left

   to right sequentially for an image row.  By default each  image  row  is

   written  sequentially, top to bottom.  In the case that the Interlace or

   'I' bit is set in byte 10 of the Image Descriptor then the row order  of

   the  image  display  follows  a  four-pass process in which the image is

   filled in by widely spaced rows.  The first pass writes every  8th  row,

   starting  with  the top row of the image window.  The second pass writes

   every 8th row starting at the fifth row from the top.   The  third  pass

   writes every 4th row starting at the third row from the top.  The fourth

   pass completes the image, writing  every  other  row,  starting  at  the

   second row from the top.  A graphic description of this process follows:

   . . . 

        The image pixel values are processed as a series of  color  indices

   which  map  into the existing color map.  The resulting color value from

   the map is what is actually displayed.  This series  of  pixel  indices,

   the  number  of  which  is equal to image-width*image-height pixels, are

   passed to the GIF image data stream one value per pixel, compressed  and

   packaged  according  to  a  version  of the LZW compression algorithm as

   defined in Appendix C.

Specification

 GIF TERMINATOR

        In order to provide a synchronization for the termination of a  GIF

   image  file,  a  GIF  decoder  will process the end of GIF mode when the

   character 0x3B hex or ';' is found after an image  has  been  processed.

   By  convention  the  decoding software will pause and wait for an action

   indicating that the user is ready to continue.  This may be  a  carriage

   return  entered  at  the  keyboard  or  a  mouse click.  For interactive

   applications this user action must  be  passed  on  to  the  host  as  a

   carriage  return  character  so  that the host application can continue.

   The decoding software will then typically leave graphics mode and resume

   any previous process.

 GIF EXTENSION BLOCKS

        To provide for orderly extension of the GIF definition, a mechanism

   for  defining  the  packaging  of extensions within a GIF data stream is

   necessary.  Specific GIF extensions are to be defined and documented  by

   CompuServe in order to provide a controlled enhancement path.

        GIF Extension Blocks are packaged in a manner similar to that  used

   by the raster data though not compressed.  The basic structure is:

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  Byte #

   or occur before the GIF Terminator.

        All GIF decoders must be able to recognize  the  existence  of  GIF

   Extension  Blocks  and  read past them if unable to process the function

   code.  This ensures that older decoders will be able to process extended

   GIF   image   files   in  the  future,  though  without  the  additional

   functionality.

Appendix A - Glossary

                                 GLOSSARY

Pixel - The smallest picture element of a  graphics  image.   This  usually

   corresponds  to  a single dot on a graphics screen.  Image resolution is

   typically given in units of  pixels.   For  example  a  fairly  standard

   graphics  screen  format  is  one 320 pixels across and 200 pixels high.

   Each pixel can  appear  as  one  of  several  colors  depending  on  the

   capabilities of the graphics hardware.

Raster - A horizontal row of pixels representing one line of an  image.   A

   typical method of working with images since most hardware is oriented to

   work most efficiently in this manner.

LSB - Least Significant Byte.  Refers to a convention for two byte  numeric

   values in which the less significant byte of the value preceeds the more

   significant byte.  This convention is typical on many microcomputers.

Color Map - The list of definitions of each color  used  in  a  GIF  image.

   These  desired  colors are converted to available colors through a table

   which is derived by assigning an incoming color index (from  the  image)

   to  an  output  color  index  (of  the  hardware).   While the color map

   definitons are specified in a GIF image, the output  pixel  colors  will

   vary  based  on  the  hardware used and its ability to match the defined

   color.

Interlace - The method of displaying a GIF image in which  multiple  passes

   are  made,  outputting  raster  lines  spaced  apart to provide a way of

   visualizing the general content of an entire image  before  all  of  the

   data has been processed.

B Protocol - A CompuServe-developed error-correcting file transfer protocol

   available  in  the  public  domain  and implemented in CompuServe VIDTEX

   products.  This error checking mechanism will be used  in  transfers  of

   GIF images for interactive applications.

LZW - A sophisticated data compression algorithm  based  on  work  done  by

   Lempel-Ziv  &  Welch  which  has  the feature of very efficient one-pass

   encoding and decoding.  This allows the image  to  be  decompressed  and

   displayed  at  the  same  time.   The  original  article from which this

   technique was adapted is:

          Terry  A.   Welch,  "A  Technique  for  High   Performance   Data

          Compression", IEEE Computer, vol 17 no 6 (June 1984)

        This basic algorithm is also used in the  public  domain  ARC  file

   compression  utilities.   The  CompuServe  adaptation  of LZW for GIF is

   described in Appendix C.

Appendix B - Interactive Sequences

           GIF Sequence Exchanges for an Interactive Environment

        The following sequences are defined for use  in  mediating  control

   between a GIF sender and GIF receiver over an interactive communications

   line.  These  sequences  do  not  apply  to  applications  that  involve

   downloading  of  static  GIF  files and are not considered part of a GIF

   file.

 GIF CAPABILITIES ENQUIRY

        The GCE sequence is issued from a host and requests an  interactive

   GIF  decoder  to  return  a  response  message that defines the graphics

   parameters for the decoder.  This involves returning  information  about

   available screen sizes, number of bits/color supported and the amount of

   color detail supported.  The escape sequence for the GCE is defined as:

        ESC [ > 0 g     (g is lower case, spaces inserted for clarity)

                         (0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x30 0x67)

 GIF CAPABILITIES RESPONSE

        The GIF Capabilities Response message is returned by an interactive

   GIF  decoder  and  defines  the  decoder's  display capabilities for all

   graphics modes that are supported by the software.  Note that  this  can

   also include graphics printers as well as a monitor screen.  The general

   format of this message is:

     #version;protocol{;dev, width, height, color-bits, color-res}... <CR>

   '#'          - GCR identifier character (Number Sign)

   version      - GIF format version number;  initially '87a'

   protocol='0' - No end-to-end protocol supported by decoder

                  Transfer as direct 8-bit data stream.

   protocol='1' - Can use an error correction protocol to transfer GIF data

               interactively from the host directly to the display.

   dev = '0'    - Screen parameter set follows

   dev = '1'    - Printer parameter set follows

   width        - Maximum supported display width in pixels

   height       - Maximum supported display height in pixels

   color-bits   - Number of  bits  per  pixel  supported.   The  number  of

               supported colors is therefore 2**color-bits.

   color-res    - Number of bits  per  color  component  supported  in  the

               hardware  color  palette.   If  color-res  is  '0'  then  no

               hardware palette table is available.

        Note that all values in the  GCR  are  returned  as  ASCII  decimal

   numbers and the message is terminated by a Carriage Return character.

Appendix B - Interactive Sequences

        The  following   GCR   message   describes   three   standard   EGA

   configurations  with  no  printer;  the GIF data stream can be processed

   within an error correcting protocol:

        #87a;1 ;0,320,200,4,0 ;0,640,200,2,2 ;0,640,350,4,2<CR>

 ENTER GIF GRAPHICS MODE

        Two sequences are currently defined to invoke  an  interactive  GIF

   decoder into action.  The only difference between them is that different

   output media are selected.  These sequences are:

     ESC [ > 1 g   Display GIF image on screen

                   (0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x31 0x67)

     ESC [ > 2 g   Display image directly to an attached graphics  printer.

                   The  image  may optionally be displayed on the screen as

                   well.

                   (0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x32 0x67)

        Note that the 'g' character terminating each sequence is  in  lower

   case.

 INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT

        The assumed environment for the transmission of GIF image data from

   an  interactive  application  is  a  full 8-bit data stream from host to

   micro.  All 256 character codes must be transferrable.  The establishing

   of  an 8-bit data path for communications will normally be taken care of

   by the host application programs.  It is however  up  to  the  receiving

   communications programs supporting GIF to be able to receive and pass on

   all 256 8-bit codes to the GIF decoder software.

Appendix C - Image Packaging & Compression

        The Raster Data stream that represents the actual output image  can

   be represented as:

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

        +---------------+

        |   code size   | 

        +---------------+     ---+

        |blok byte count|        |

        +---------------+        |

        :               :        +-- Repeated as many times as necessary

        |  data bytes   |        |

        :               :        |

        +---------------+     ---+

        . . .       . . .

        +---------------+

        |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0|       zero byte count (terminates data stream)

        +---------------+

        The conversion of the image from a series  of  pixel  values  to  a

   transmitted or stored character stream involves several steps.  In brief

   these steps are:

   1.  Establish the Code Size -  Define  the  number  of  bits  needed  to

       represent the actual data.

   2.  Compress the Data - Compress the series of image pixels to a  series

       of compression codes.

   3.  Build a Series of Bytes - Take the  set  of  compression  codes  and

       convert to a string of 8-bit bytes.

   4.  Package the Bytes - Package sets of bytes into blocks  preceeded  by

       character counts and output.

ESTABLISH CODE SIZE

        The first byte of the GIF Raster Data stream is a value  indicating

   the minimum number of bits required to represent the set of actual pixel

   values.  Normally this will be the same as the  number  of  color  bits.

   Because  of  some  algorithmic constraints however, black & white images

   which have one color bit must be indicated as having a code size  of  2.

   This  code size value also implies that the compression codes must start

   out one bit longer.

COMPRESSION

        The LZW algorithm converts a series of data values into a series of

   codes  which may be raw values or a code designating a series of values.

   Using text characters as an analogy,  the  output  code  consists  of  a

   character or a code representing a string of characters.

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)                                   Page 13

Appendix C - Image Packaging & Compression

        The LZW algorithm used in  GIF  matches  algorithmically  with  the

   standard LZW algorithm with the following differences:

   1.  A   special   Clear   code   is    defined    which    resets    all

       compression/decompression parameters and tables to a start-up state.

       The value of this code is 2**<code size>.  For example if  the  code

       size  indicated  was 4 (image was 4 bits/pixel) the Clear code value

       would be 16 (10000 binary).  The Clear code can appear at any  point

       in the image data stream and therefore requires the LZW algorithm to

       process succeeding codes as if  a  new  data  stream  was  starting.

       Encoders  should output a Clear code as the first code of each image

       data stream.

   2.  An End of Information code is defined that explicitly indicates  the

       end  of  the image data stream.  LZW processing terminates when this

       code is encountered.  It must be the last code output by the encoder

       for an image.  The value of this code is <Clear code>+1.

   3.  The first available compression code value is <Clear code>+2.

   4.  The output codes are of variable length, starting  at  <code size>+1

       bits  per code, up to 12 bits per code.  This defines a maximum code

       value of 4095 (hex FFF).  Whenever the LZW code value  would  exceed

       the  current  code length, the code length is increased by one.  The

       packing/unpacking of these codes must then be altered to reflect the

       new code length.

BUILD 8-BIT BYTES

        Because the LZW compression  used  for  GIF  creates  a  series  of

   variable  length  codes, of between 3 and 12 bits each, these codes must

   be reformed into a series of 8-bit bytes that  will  be  the  characters

   actually stored or transmitted.  This provides additional compression of

   the image.  The codes are formed into a stream of bits as if  they  were

   packed  right to left and then picked off 8 bits at a time to be output.

   Assuming a character array of 8 bits per character and using 5 bit codes

   to be packed, an example layout would be similar to:

         byte n       byte 5   byte 4   byte 3   byte 2   byte 1

        +-.....-----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

        | and so on |hhhhhggg|ggfffffe|eeeedddd|dcccccbb|bbbaaaaa|

        +-.....-----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

        Note that the physical  packing  arrangement  will  change  as  the

   number  of  bits per compression code change but the concept remains the

   same.

PACKAGE THE BYTES

        Once the bytes have been created, they are grouped into blocks  for

   output by preceeding each block of 0 to 255 bytes with a character count

   byte.  A block with a zero byte count terminates the Raster Data  stream

   for  a  given  image.  These blocks are what are actually output for the

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)                                   Page 14

Appendix C - Image Packaging & Compression

   GIF image.  This block format has the side effect of allowing a decoding

   program  the  ability to read past the actual image data if necessary by

   reading block counts and then skipping over the data.

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)                                   Page 15

Appendix D - Multiple Image Processing

        Since a  GIF  data  stream  can  contain  multiple  images,  it  is

   necessary  to  describe  processing and display of such a file.  Because

   the image descriptor allows  for  placement  of  the  image  within  the

   logical  screen,  it is possible to define a sequence of images that may

   each be a partial screen, but in total  fill  the  entire  screen.   The

   guidelines for handling the multiple image situation are:

   1.  There is no pause between images.  Each is processed immediately  as

       seen by the decoder.

   2.  Each image explicitly overwrites any image  already  on  the  screen

       inside  of  its window.  The only screen clears are at the beginning

       and end of the  GIF  image  process.   See  discussion  on  the  GIF

       terminator.





    Cover Sheet for the GIF89a Specification


    DEFERRED CLEAR CODE IN LZW COMPRESSION

    There has been confusion about where clear codes can be found in the
    data stream.  As the specification says, they may appear at anytime.  There
    is not a requirement to send a clear code when the string table is full.

    It is the encoder's decision as to when the table should be cleared.  When
    the table is full, the encoder can chose to use the table as is, making no
    changes to it until the encoder chooses to clear it.  The encoder during
    this time sends out codes that are of the maximum Code Size.

    As we can see from the above, when the decoder's table is full, it must
    not change the table until a clear code is received.  The Code Size is that
    of the maximum Code Size.  Processing other than this is done normally.

    Because of a large base of decoders that do not handle the decompression in
    this manner, we ask developers of GIF encoding software to NOT implement
    this feature until at least January 1991 and later if they see that their
    particular market is not ready for it.  This will give developers of GIF
    decoding software time to implement this feature and to get it into the
    hands of their clients before the decoders start "breaking" on the new
    GIF's.  It is not required that encoders change their software to take
    advantage of the deferred clear code, but it is for decoders.

    APPLICATION EXTENSION BLOCK - APPLICATION IDENTIFIER

    There will be a Courtesy Directory file located on CompuServe in the PICS
    forum.  This directory will contain Application Identifiers for Application
    Extension Blocks that have been used by developers of GIF applications.
    This file is intended to help keep developers that wish to create
    Application Extension Blocks from using the same Application Identifiers.
    This is not an official directory; it is for voluntary participation only
    and does not guarantee that someone will not use the same identifier.

    E-Mail can be sent to Larry Wood (forum manager of PICS) indicating the
    request for inclusion in this file with an identifier.

4. About the Document.

This document describes in detail the definition of the Graphics Interchange
Format.  This document is intended as a programming reference; it is
recommended that the entire document be read carefully before programming,
because of the interdependence of the various parts. There is an individual
section for each of the Format blocks. Within each section, the sub-section
labeled Required Version refers to the version number that an encoder will have
to use if the corresponding block is used in the Data Stream. Within each
section, a diagram describes the individual fields in the block; the diagrams
are drawn vertically; top bytes in the diagram appear first in the Data Stream.
Bits within a byte are drawn most significant on the left end.  Multi-byte
numeric fields are ordered Least Significant Byte first. Numeric constants are
represented as Hexadecimal numbers, preceded by "0x".  Bit fields within a byte
are described in order from most significant bits to least significant bits.

The Graphics Interchange Format(sm) defines a protocol intended for the on-line
transmission and interchange of raster graphic data in a way that is
independent of the hardware used in their creation or display.

The Graphics Interchange Format is defined in terms of blocks and sub-blocks
which contain relevant parameters and data used in the reproduction of a
graphic. A GIF Data Stream is a sequence of protocol blocks and sub-blocks
representing a collection of graphics. In general, the graphics in a Data
Stream are assumed to be related to some degree, and to share some control
information; it is recommended that encoders attempt to group together related
graphics in order to minimize hardware changes during processing and to
minimize control information overhead. For the same reason, unrelated graphics
or graphics which require resetting hardware parameters should be encoded
separately to the extent possible.

A Data Stream may originate locally, as when read from a file, or it may
originate remotely, as when transmitted over a data communications line. The
Format is defined with the assumption that an error-free Transport Level
Protocol is used for communications; the Format makes no provisions for
error-detection and error-correction.

The GIF Data Stream must be interpreted in context, that is, the application
program must rely on information external to the Data Stream to invoke the
decoder process.


6. Version Numbers.

The version number in the Header of a Data Stream is intended to identify the
minimum set of capabilities required of a decoder in order to fully process the
Data Stream.  An encoder should use the earliest possible version number that
includes all the blocks used in the Data Stream. Within each block section in
this document, there is an entry labeled Required Version which specifies the







                                                                         3


earliest version number that includes the corresponding block.  The encoder
should make every attempt to use the earliest version number covering all the
blocks in the Data Stream; the unnecessary use of later version numbers will
hinder processing by some decoders.


7. The Encoder.

The Encoder is the program used to create a GIF Data Stream. From raster data
and other information, the encoder produces the necessary control and data
blocks needed for reproducing the original graphics.

The encoder has the following primary responsibilities.

            - Include in the Data Stream all the necessary information to
            reproduce  the graphics.

            - Insure that a Data Stream is labeled with the earliest possible
            Version Number that will cover the definition of all the blocks in
            it; this is to ensure that the largest number of decoders can
            process the Data Stream.

            - Ensure encoding of the graphics in such a way that the decoding
            process is optimized. Avoid redundant information as much as
            possible.

            - To the extent possible, avoid grouping graphics which might
            require resetting hardware parameters during the decoding process.

            - Set to zero (off) each of the bits of each and every field
            designated as reserved. Note that some fields in the Logical Screen
            Descriptor and the Image Descriptor were reserved under Version
            87a, but are used under version 89a.


8. The Decoder.

The Decoder is the program used to process a GIF Data Stream. It processes the
Data Stream sequentially, parsing the various blocks and sub-blocks, using the
control information to set hardware and process parameters and interpreting the
data to render the graphics.

The decoder has the following primary responsibilities.

            - Process each graphic in the Data Stream in sequence, without
            delays other than those specified in the control information.

            - Set its hardware parameters to fit, as closely as possible, the
            control information contained in the Data Stream.


9. Compliance.

An encoder or a decoder is said to comply with a given version of the Graphics
Interchange Format if and only if it fully conforms with and correctly
implements the definition of the standard associated with that version.  An







                                                                         4


encoder or a decoder may be compliant with a given version number and not
compliant with some subsequent version.


10. About Recommendations.

Each block section in this document contains an entry labeled Recommendation;
this section lists a set of recommendations intended to guide and organize the
use of the particular blocks. Such recommendations are geared towards making
the functions of encoders and decoders more efficient, as well as making
optimal use of the communications bandwidth.  It is advised that these
recommendations be followed.


11. About Color Tables.

The GIF format utilizes color tables to render raster-based graphics. A color
table can have one of two different scopes: global or local. A Global Color
Table is used by all those graphics in the Data Stream which do not have a
Local Color Table associated with them. The scope of the Global Color Table is
the entire Data Stream. A Local Color Table is always associated with the
graphic that immediately follows it; the scope of a Local Color Table is
limited to that single graphic. A Local Color Table supersedes a Global Color
Table, that is, if a Data Stream contains a Global Color Table, and an image
has a Local Color Table associated with it, the decoder must save the Global
Color Table, use the Local Color Table to render the image, and then restore
the Global Color Table. Both types of color tables are optional, making it
possible for a Data Stream to contain numerous graphics without a color table
at all. For this reason, it is recommended that the decoder save the last
Global Color Table used until another Global Color Table is encountered. In
this way, a Data Stream which does not contain either a Global Color Table or
a Local Color Table may be processed using the last Global Color Table saved.
If a Global Color Table from a previous Stream is used, that table becomes the
Global Color Table of the present Stream. This is intended to reduce the
overhead incurred by color tables. In particular, it is recommended that an
encoder use only one Global Color Table if all the images in related Data
Streams can be rendered with the same table.  If no color table is available at
all, the decoder is free to use a system color table or a table of its own. In
that case, the decoder may use a color table with as many colors as its
hardware is able to support; it is recommended that such a table have black and
white as its first two entries, so that monochrome images can be rendered
adequately.

The Definition of the GIF Format allows for a Data Stream to contain only the
Header, the Logical Screen Descriptor, a Global Color Table and the GIF
Trailer. Such a Data Stream would be used to load a decoder with a Global Color
Table, in preparation for subsequent Data Streams without a color table at all.


12. Blocks, Extensions and Scope.

Blocks can be classified into three groups : Control, Graphic-Rendering and
Special Purpose.  Control blocks, such as the Header, the Logical Screen
Descriptor, the Graphic Control Extension and the Trailer, contain information
used to control the process of the Data Stream or information  used in setting
hardware parameters.  Graphic-Rendering blocks such as the Image Descriptor and







                                                                         5


the Plain Text Extension contain information and data used to render a graphic
on the display device. Special Purpose blocks such as the Comment Extension and
the Application Extension are neither used to control the process of the Data
Stream nor do they contain information or data used to render a graphic on the
display device. With the exception of the Logical Screen Descriptor and the
Global Color Table, whose scope is the entire Data Stream, all other Control
blocks have a limited scope, restricted to the Graphic-Rendering block that
follows them.  Special Purpose blocks do not delimit the scope of any Control
blocks; Special Purpose blocks are transparent to the decoding process.
Graphic-Rendering blocks and extensions are used as scope delimiters for
Control blocks and extensions. The labels used to identify labeled blocks fall
into three ranges : 0x00-0x7F (0-127) are the Graphic Rendering blocks,
excluding the Trailer (0x3B); 0x80-0xF9 (128-249) are the Control blocks;
0xFA-0xFF (250-255) are the Special Purpose blocks. These ranges are defined so
that decoders can handle block scope by appropriately identifying block labels,
even when the block itself cannot be processed.


13. Block Sizes.

The Block Size field in a block, counts the number of bytes remaining in the
block, not counting the Block Size field itself, and not counting the Block
Terminator, if one is to follow.  Blocks other than Data Blocks are intended to
be of fixed length; the Block Size field is provided in order to facilitate
skipping them, not to allow their size to change in the future.  Data blocks
and sub-blocks are of variable length to accommodate the amount of data.


14. Using GIF as an embedded protocol.

As an embedded protocol, GIF may be part of larger application protocols,
within which GIF is used to render graphics.  In such a case, the application
protocol could define a block within which the GIF Data Stream would be
contained. The application program would then invoke a GIF decoder upon
encountering a block of type GIF.  This approach is recommended in favor of
using Application Extensions, which become overhead for all other applications
that do not process them. Because a GIF Data Stream must be processed in
context, the application must rely on some means of identifying the GIF Data
Stream outside of the Stream itself.


15. Data Sub-blocks.

      a. Description. Data Sub-blocks are units containing data. They do not
      have a label, these blocks are processed in the context of control
      blocks, wherever data blocks are specified in the format. The first byte
      of the Data sub-block indicates the number of data bytes to follow. A
      data sub-block may contain from 0 to 255 data bytes. The size of the
      block does not account for the size byte itself, therefore, the empty
      sub-block is one whose size field contains 0x00.

17. Header.

      a. Description. The Header identifies the GIF Data Stream in context. The
      Signature field marks the beginning of the Data Stream, and the Version
      field identifies the set of capabilities required of a decoder to fully
      process the Data Stream.  This block is REQUIRED; exactly one Header must
      be present per Data Stream.

      b. Required Version.  Not applicable. This block is not subject to a
      version number. This block must appear at the beginning of every Data
      Stream.

            i) Signature - Identifies the GIF Data Stream. This field contains
            the fixed value 'GIF'.

            ii) Version - Version number used to format the data stream.
            Identifies the minimum set of capabilities necessary to a decoder
            to fully process the contents of the Data Stream.

            Version Numbers as of 10 July 1990 :       "87a" - May 1987
                                                       "89a" - July 1989

            Version numbers are ordered numerically increasing on the first two
            digits starting with 87 (87,88,...,99,00,...,85,86) and
            alphabetically increasing on the third character (a,...,z).

            iii) Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the entire
            Data Stream. This block cannot be modified by any extension.










                                                                         8


      d. Recommendations.

            i) Signature - This field identifies the beginning of the GIF Data
            Stream; it is not intended to provide a unique signature for the
            identification of the data. It is recommended that the GIF Data
            Stream be identified externally by the application. (Refer to
            Appendix G for on-line identification of the GIF Data Stream.)

            ii) Version - ENCODER : An encoder should use the earliest possible
            version number that defines all the blocks used in the Data Stream.
            When two or more Data Streams are combined, the latest of the
            individual version numbers should be used for the resulting Data
            Stream. DECODER : A decoder should attempt to process the data
            stream to the best of its ability; if it encounters a version
            number which it is not capable of processing fully, it should
            nevertheless, attempt to process the data stream to the best of its
            ability, perhaps after warning the user that the data may be
            incomplete.


18. Logical Screen Descriptor.

      a. Description.  The Logical Screen Descriptor contains the parameters
      necessary to define the area of the display device within which the
      images will be rendered.  The coordinates in this block are given with
      respect to the top-left corner of the virtual screen; they do not
      necessarily refer to absolute coordinates on the display device.  This
      implies that they could refer to window coordinates in a window-based
      environment or printer coordinates when a printer is used.

      This block is REQUIRED; exactly one Logical Screen Descriptor must be
      present per Data Stream.

      b. Required Version.  Not applicable. This block is not subject to a
      version number. This block must appear immediately after the Header.

                             Size of Global Color Table    3 Bits

            i) Logical Screen Width - Width, in pixels, of the Logical Screen
            where the images will be rendered in the displaying device.

            ii) Logical Screen Height - Height, in pixels, of the Logical
            Screen where the images will be rendered in the displaying device.

            iii) Global Color Table Flag - Flag indicating the presence of a
            Global Color Table; if the flag is set, the Global Color Table will
            immediately follow the Logical Screen Descriptor. This flag also
            selects the interpretation of the Background Color Index; if the
            flag is set, the value of the Background Color Index field should
            be used as the table index of the background color. (This field is
            the most significant bit of the byte.)

            Values :    0 -   No Global Color Table follows, the Background
                              Color Index field is meaningless.
                        1 -   A Global Color Table will immediately follow, the
                              Background Color Index field is meaningful.

            iv) Color Resolution - Number of bits per primary color available
            to the original image, minus 1. This value represents the size of
            the entire palette from which the colors in the graphic were
            selected, not the number of colors actually used in the graphic.
            For example, if the value in this field is 3, then the palette of
            the original image had 4 bits per primary color available to create
            the image.  This value should be set to indicate the richness of
            the original palette, even if not every color from the whole
            palette is available on the source machine.

            v) Sort Flag - Indicates whether the Global Color Table is sorted.
            If the flag is set, the Global Color Table is sorted, in order of
            decreasing importance. Typically, the order would be decreasing
            frequency, with most frequent color first. This assists a decoder,
            with fewer available colors, in choosing the best subset of colors;
            the decoder may use an initial segment of the table to render the
            graphic.

            Values :    0 -   Not ordered.
                        1 -   Ordered by decreasing importance, most
                              important color first.

            vi) Size of Global Color Table - If the Global Color Table Flag is
            set to 1, the value in this field is used to calculate the number
            of bytes contained in the Global Color Table. To determine that
            actual size of the color table, raise 2 to [the value of the field
            + 1].  Even if there is no Global Color Table specified, set this
            field according to the above formula so that decoders can choose
            the best graphics mode to display the stream in.  (This field is
            made up of the 3 least significant bits of the byte.)

            vii) Background Color Index - Index into the Global Color Table for







                                                                        10


            the Background Color. The Background Color is the color used for
            those pixels on the screen that are not covered by an image. If the
            Global Color Table Flag is set to (zero), this field should be zero
            and should be ignored.

            viii) Pixel Aspect Ratio - Factor used to compute an approximation
            of the aspect ratio of the pixel in the original image.  If the
            value of the field is not 0, this approximation of the aspect ratio
            is computed based on the formula:

            Aspect Ratio = (Pixel Aspect Ratio + 15) / 64

            The Pixel Aspect Ratio is defined to be the quotient of the pixel's
            width over its height.  The value range in this field allows
            specification of the widest pixel of 4:1 to the tallest pixel of
            1:4 in increments of 1/64th.

            Values :        0 -   No aspect ratio information is given.
                       1..255 -   Value used in the computation.

19. Global Color Table.

      a. Description. This block contains a color table, which is a sequence of
      bytes representing red-green-blue color triplets. The Global Color Table
      is used by images without a Local Color Table and by Plain Text
      Extensions. Its presence is marked by the Global Color Table Flag being
      set to 1 in the Logical Screen Descriptor; if present, it immediately
      follows the Logical Screen Descriptor and contains a number of bytes
      equal to
                    3 x 2^(Size of Global Color Table+1).

      This block is OPTIONAL; at most one Global Color Table may be present
      per Data Stream.

20. Image Descriptor.

      a. Description. Each image in the Data Stream is composed of an Image
      Descriptor, an optional Local Color Table, and the image data.  Each
      image must fit within the boundaries of the Logical Screen, as defined
      in the Logical Screen Descriptor.

      The Image Descriptor contains the parameters necessary to process a table
      based image. The coordinates given in this block refer to coordinates
      within the Logical Screen, and are given in pixels. This block is a
      Graphic-Rendering Block, optionally preceded by one or more Control
      blocks such as the Graphic Control Extension, and may be optionally
      followed by a Local Color Table; the Image Descriptor is always followed
      by the image data.

      This block is REQUIRED for an image.  Exactly one Image Descriptor must
      be present per image in the Data Stream.  An unlimited number of images
      may be present per Data Stream.

           i) Image Separator - Identifies the beginning of an Image
           Descriptor. This field contains the fixed value 0x2C.

           ii) Image Left Position - Column number, in pixels, of the left edge
           of the image, with respect to the left edge of the Logical Screen.
           Leftmost column of the Logical Screen is 0.

           iii) Image Top Position - Row number, in pixels, of the top edge of
           the image with respect to the top edge of the Logical Screen. Top
           row of the Logical Screen is 0.

           iv) Image Width - Width of the image in pixels.

           v) Image Height - Height of the image in pixels.

           vi) Local Color Table Flag - Indicates the presence of a Local Color
           Table immediately following this Image Descriptor. (This field is
           the most significant bit of the byte.)


           Values :    0 -   Local Color Table is not present. Use
                             Global Color Table if available.
                       1 -   Local Color Table present, and to follow

           vii) Interlace Flag - Indicates if the image is interlaced. An image
           is interlaced in a four-pass interlace pattern; see Appendix E for
           details.

           Values :    0 - Image is not interlaced.
                       1 - Image is interlaced.

            viii) Sort Flag - Indicates whether the Local Color Table is
            sorted.  If the flag is set, the Local Color Table is sorted, in
            order of decreasing importance. Typically, the order would be
            decreasing frequency, with most frequent color first. This assists
            a decoder, with fewer available colors, in choosing the best subset
            of colors; the decoder may use an initial segment of the table to
            render the graphic.

            Values :    0 -   Not ordered.
                        1 -   Ordered by decreasing importance, most
                              important color first.

            ix) Size of Local Color Table - If the Local Color Table Flag is
            set to 1, the value in this field is used to calculate the number
            of bytes contained in the Local Color Table. To determine that
            actual size of the color table, raise 2 to the value of the field
            + 1. This value should be 0 if there is no Local Color Table
            specified. (This field is made up of the 3 least significant bits
            of the byte.)

     d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the Table-based Image
     Data Block that follows it. This block may be modified by the Graphic
     Control Extension.

     e. Recommendation. None.


21. Local Color Table.

     a. Description. This block contains a color table, which is a sequence of
     bytes representing red-green-blue color triplets. The Local Color Table
     is used by the image that immediately follows. Its presence is marked by
     the Local Color Table Flag being set to 1 in the Image Descriptor; if
     present, the Local Color Table immediately follows the Image Descriptor
     and contains a number of bytes equal to
                          3x2^(Size of Local Color Table+1).
     If present, this color table temporarily becomes the active color table
     and the following image should be processed using it. This block is
     OPTIONAL; at most one Local Color Table may be present per Image
     Descriptor and its scope is the single image associated with the Image
     Descriptor that precedes it.

22. Table Based Image Data.

     a. Description. The image data for a table based image consists of a
     sequence of sub-blocks, of size at most 255 bytes each, containing an
     index into the active color table, for each pixel in the image.  Pixel
     indices are in order of left to right and from top to bottom.  Each index
     must be within the range of the size of the active color table, starting
     at 0. The sequence of indices is encoded using the LZW Algorithm with
     variable-length code, as described in Appendix F

            i) LZW Minimum Code Size.  This byte determines the initial number
            of bits used for LZW codes in the image data, as described in
            Appendix F.

     d. Extensions and Scope. This block has no scope, it contains raster
     data. Extensions intended to modify a Table-based image must appear
     before the corresponding Image Descriptor.

     e. Recommendations. None.


23. Graphic Control Extension.

      a. Description. The Graphic Control Extension contains parameters used
      when processing a graphic rendering block. The scope of this extension is
      the first graphic rendering block to follow. The extension contains only
      one data sub-block.

      This block is OPTIONAL; at most one Graphic Control Extension may precede
      a graphic rendering block. This is the only limit to the number of
      Graphic Control Extensions that may be contained in a Data Stream.

            iii) Block Size - Number of bytes in the block, after the Block
            Size field and up to but not including the Block Terminator.  This
            field contains the fixed value 4.

            iv) Disposal Method - Indicates the way in which the graphic is to
            be treated after being displayed.

            Values :    0 -   No disposal specified. The decoder is
                              not required to take any action.
                        1 -   Do not dispose. The graphic is to be left
                              in place.
                        2 -   Restore to background color. The area used by the
                              graphic must be restored to the background color.
                        3 -   Restore to previous. The decoder is required to
                              restore the area overwritten by the graphic with
                              what was there prior to rendering the graphic.
                     4-7 -    To be defined.

            v) User Input Flag - Indicates whether or not user input is
            expected before continuing. If the flag is set, processing will
            continue when user input is entered. The nature of the User input
            is determined by the application (Carriage Return, Mouse Button
            Click, etc.).

            Values :    0 -   User input is not expected.
                        1 -   User input is expected.

            When a Delay Time is used and the User Input Flag is set,
            processing will continue when user input is received or when the
            delay time expires, whichever occurs first.

            vi) Transparency Flag - Indicates whether a transparency index is
            given in the Transparent Index field. (This field is the least
            significant bit of the byte.)

            Values :    0 -   Transparent Index is not given.
                        1 -   Transparent Index is given.

            vii) Delay Time - If not 0, this field specifies the number of
            hundredths (1/100) of a second to wait before continuing with the
            processing of the Data Stream. The clock starts ticking immediately
            after the graphic is rendered. This field may be used in
            conjunction with the User Input Flag field.

            viii) Transparency Index - The Transparency Index is such that when
            encountered, the corresponding pixel of the display device is not
            modified and processing goes on to the next pixel. The index is

                                                                        17

            the Graphic Control Extension.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this Extension is the graphic
      rendering block that follows it; it is possible for other extensions to
      be present between this block and its target. This block can modify the
      Image Descriptor Block and the Plain Text Extension.

      e. Recommendations.

            i) Disposal Method - The mode Restore To Previous is intended to be
            used in small sections of the graphic; the use of this mode imposes
            severe demands on the decoder to store the section of the graphic
            that needs to be saved. For this reason, this mode should be used
            sparingly.  This mode is not intended to save an entire graphic or
            large areas of a graphic; when this is the case, the encoder should
            make every attempt to make the sections of the graphic to be
            restored be separate graphics in the data stream. In the case where
            a decoder is not capable of saving an area of a graphic marked as
            Restore To Previous, it is recommended that a decoder restore to
            the background color.

            ii) User Input Flag - When the flag is set, indicating that user
            input is expected, the decoder may sound the bell (0x07) to alert
            the user that input is being expected.  In the absence of a
            specified Delay Time, the decoder should wait for user input
            indefinitely.  It is recommended that the encoder not set the User
            Input Flag without a Delay Time specified.


24. Comment Extension.

      a. Description. The Comment Extension contains textual information which
      is not part of the actual graphics in the GIF Data Stream. It is suitable
      for including comments about the graphics, credits, descriptions or any
      other type of non-control and non-graphic data.  The Comment Extension
      may be ignored by the decoder, or it may be saved for later processing;
      under no circumstances should a Comment Extension disrupt or interfere
      with the processing of the Data Stream.

      This block is OPTIONAL; any number of them may appear in the Data Stream.

            This field contains the fixed value 0xFE.

            iii) Comment Data - Sequence of sub-blocks, each of size at most
            255 bytes and at least 1 byte, with the size in a byte preceding
            the data.  The end of the sequence is marked by the Block
            Terminator.

            iv) Block Terminator - This zero-length data block marks the end of
            the Comment Extension.

      d. Extensions and Scope. This block does not have scope. This block
      cannot be modified by any extension.

      e. Recommendations.

            i) Data - This block is intended for humans.  It should contain
            text using the 7-bit ASCII character set. This block should
            not be used to store control information for custom processing.

            ii) Position - This block may appear at any point in the Data
            Stream at which a block can begin; however, it is recommended that
            Comment Extensions do not interfere with Control or Data blocks;
            they should be located at the beginning or at the end of the Data
            Stream to the extent possible.


25. Plain Text Extension.

      a. Description. The Plain Text Extension contains textual data and the
      parameters necessary to render that data as a graphic, in a simple form.
      The textual data will be encoded with the 7-bit printable ASCII
      characters.  Text data are rendered using a grid of character cells








                                                                        19


      defined by the parameters in the block fields. Each character is rendered
      in an individual cell. The textual data in this block is to be rendered
      as mono-spaced characters, one character per cell, with a best fitting
      font and size. For further information, see the section on
      Recommendations below. The data characters are taken sequentially from
      the data portion of the block and rendered within a cell, starting with
      the upper left cell in the grid and proceeding from left to right and
      from top to bottom. Text data is rendered until the end of data is
      reached or the character grid is filled.  The Character Grid contains an
      integral number of cells; in the case that the cell dimensions do not
      allow for an integral number, fractional cells must be discarded; an
      encoder must be careful to specify the grid dimensions accurately so that
      this does not happen. This block requires a Global Color Table to be
      available; the colors used by this block reference the Global Color Table
      in the Stream if there is one, or the Global Color Table from a previous
      Stream, if one was saved. This block is a graphic rendering block,
      therefore it may be modified by a Graphic Control Extension.  This block
      is OPTIONAL; any number of them may appear in the Data Stream.

      d. Extensions and Scope. The scope of this block is the Plain Text Data
      Block contained in it. This block may be modified by the Graphic Control
      Extension.

      e. Recommendations. The data in the Plain Text Extension is assumed to be
      preformatted. The selection of font and size is left to the discretion of
      the decoder.  If characters less than 0x20 or greater than 0xf7 are
      encountered, it is recommended that the decoder display a Space character
      (0x20). The encoder should use grid and cell dimensions such that an
      integral number of cells fit in the grid both horizontally as well as
      vertically.  For broadest compatibility, character cell dimensions should
      be around 8x8 or 8x16 (width x height); consider an image for unusual
      sized text.

Appendix
B. GIF Grammar.

A Grammar is a form of notation to represent the sequence in which certain
objects form larger objects.  A grammar is also used to represent the number of
objects that can occur at a given position.  The grammar given here represents
the sequence of blocks that form the GIF Data Stream. A grammar is given by
listing its rules.  Each rule consists of the left-hand side, followed by some
form of equals sign, followed by the right-hand side.  In a rule, the
right-hand side describes how the left-hand side is defined. The right-hand
side consists of a sequence of entities, with the possible presence of special
symbols. The following legend defines the symbols used in this grammar for GIF.

Legend:           <>    grammar word
                  ::=   defines symbol
                  *     zero or more occurrences
                  +     one or more occurrences
                  |     alternate element
                  []    optional element

Example:

<GIF Data Stream> ::= Header <Logical Screen> <Data>* Trailer

This rule defines the entity <GIF Data Stream> as follows. It must begin with a
Header. The Header is followed by an entity called Logical Screen, which is
defined below by another rule. The Logical Screen is followed by the entity
Data, which is also defined below by another rule. Finally, the entity Data is
followed by the Trailer.  Since there is no rule defining the Header or the
Trailer, this means that these blocks are defined in the document.  The entity
Data has a special symbol (*) following it which means that, at this position,
the entity Data may be repeated any number of times, including 0 times. For
further reading on this subject, refer to a standard text on Programming
Languages.


The Grammar.

<GIF Data Stream> ::=     Header <Logical Screen> <Data>* Trailer

<Logical Screen> ::=      Logical Screen Descriptor [Global Color Table]

<Data> ::=                <Graphic Block>  |
                          <Special-Purpose Block>

<Graphic Block> ::=       [Graphic Control Extension] <Graphic-Rendering Block>

<Graphic-Rendering Block> ::=  <Table-Based Image>  |
                               Plain Text Extension

<Table-Based Image> ::=   Image Descriptor [Local Color Table] Image Data

NOTE : The grammar indicates that it is possible for a GIF Data Stream to
contain the Header, the Logical Screen Descriptor, a Global Color Table and the
GIF Trailer. This special case is used to load a GIF decoder with a Global
Color Table, in preparation for subsequent Data Streams without color tables at
all.

Appendix
C. Glossary.

Active Color Table - Color table used to render the next graphic. If the next
graphic is an image which has a Local Color Table associated with it, the
active color table becomes the Local Color Table associated with that image.
If the next graphic is an image without a Local Color Table, or a Plain Text
Extension, the active color table is the Global Color Table associated with the
Data Stream, if there is one; if there is no Global Color Table in the Data
Stream, the active color table is a color table saved from a previous Data
Stream, or one supplied by the decoder.

Block - Collection of bytes forming a protocol unit. In general, the term
includes labeled and unlabeled blocks, as well as Extensions.

Data Stream - The GIF Data Stream is composed of blocks and sub-blocks
representing images and graphics, together with control information to render
them on a display device. All control and data blocks in the Data Stream must
follow the Header and must precede the Trailer.

Decoder - A program capable of processing a GIF Data Stream to render the
images and graphics contained in it.

Encoder - A program capable of capturing and formatting image and graphic
raster data, following the definitions of the Graphics Interchange Format.

Extension - A protocol block labeled by the Extension Introducer 0x21.

Extension Introducer - Label (0x21) defining an Extension.

Graphic - Data which can be rendered on the screen by virtue of some algorithm.
The term graphic is more general than the term image; in addition to images,
the term graphic also includes data such as text, which is rendered using
character bit-maps.

Image - Data representing a picture or a drawing; an image is represented by an
array of pixels called the raster of the image.

Raster - Array of pixel values representing an image.

Appendix
D. Conventions.

Animation - The Graphics Interchange Format is not intended as a platform for
animation, even though it can be done in a limited way.

Byte Ordering - Unless otherwise stated, multi-byte numeric fields are ordered
with the Least Significant Byte first.

Color Indices - Color indices always refer to the active color table, either
the Global Color Table or the Local Color Table.

Color Order - Unless otherwise stated, all triple-component RGB color values
are specified in Red-Green-Blue order.

Color Tables - Both color tables, the Global and the Local, are optional; if
present, the Global Color Table is to be used with every image in the Data
Stream for which a Local Color Table is not given; if present, a Local Color
Table overrides the Global Color Table.  However, if neither color table is
present, the application program is free to use an arbitrary color table. If
the graphics in several Data Streams are related and all use the same color
table, an encoder could place the color table as the Global Color Table in the
first Data Stream and leave subsequent Data Streams without a Global Color
Table or any Local Color Tables; in this way, the overhead for the table is
eliminated.  It is recommended that the decoder save the previous Global Color
Table to be used with the Data Stream that follows, in case it does not contain
either a Global Color Table or any Local Color Tables. In general, this allows
the application program to use past color tables, significantly reducing
transmission overhead.

Extension Blocks - Extensions are defined using the Extension Introducer code
to mark the beginning of the block, followed by a block label, identifying the
type of extension.  Extension Codes are numbers in the range from 0x00 to 0xFF,
inclusive. Special purpose extensions are transparent to the decoder and may be
omitted when transmitting the Data Stream on-line. The GIF capabilities
dialogue makes the provision for the receiver to request the transmission of
all blocks; the default state in this regard is no transmission of Special
purpose blocks.

Reserved Fields - All Reserved Fields are expected to have each bit set to zero
(off).

E. Interlaced Images.

The rows of an Interlaced images are arranged in the following order:

      Group 1 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 0.              (Pass 1)
      Group 2 : Every 8th. row, starting with row 4.              (Pass 2)
      Group 3 : Every 4th. row, starting with row 2.              (Pass 3)
      Group 4 : Every 2nd. row, starting with row 1.              (Pass 4)

The Following example illustrates how the rows of an interlaced image are
ordered.

Appendix
F. Variable-Length-Code LZW Compression.

The Variable-Length-Code LZW Compression is a variation of the Lempel-Ziv
Compression algorithm in which variable-length codes are used to replace
patterns detected in the original data. The algorithm uses a code or
translation table constructed from the patterns encountered in the original
data; each new pattern is entered into the table and its index is used to
replace it in the compressed stream.

The compressor takes the data from the input stream and builds a code or
translation table with the patterns as it encounters them; each new pattern is
entered into the code table and its index is added to the output stream; when a
pattern is encountered which had been detected since the last code table
refresh, its index from the code table is put on the output stream, thus
achieving the data compression.  The expander takes input from the compressed
data stream and builds the code or translation table from it; as the compressed
data stream is processed, codes are used to index into the code table and the
corresponding data is put on the decompressed output stream, thus achieving
data decompression.  The details of the algorithm are explained below.  The
Variable-Length-Code aspect of the algorithm is based on an initial code size
(LZW-initial code size), which specifies the initial number of bits used for
the compression codes.  When the number of patterns detected by the compressor
in the input stream exceeds the number of patterns encodable with the current
number of bits, the number of bits per LZW code is increased by one.

The Raster Data stream that represents the actual output image can be
represented as:

         7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
        +---------------+
        | LZW code size |
        +---------------+

        +---------------+ ----+
        |  block size   |     |
        +---------------+     |
        |               |     +-- Repeated as many
        |  data bytes   |     |   times as necessary.
        |               |     |
        +---------------+ ----+

        . . .       . . . ------- The code that terminates the LZW
                                  compressed data must appear before
                                  Block Terminator.

        +---------------+

The conversion of the image from a series of pixel values to a transmitted or
stored character stream involves several steps. In brief these steps are:

1. Establish the Code Size - Define the number of bits needed to represent the
actual data.

2. Compress the Data - Compress the series of image pixels to a series of







                                                                        31


compression codes.

3. Build a Series of Bytes - Take the set of compression codes and convert to a
string of 8-bit bytes.

4. Package the Bytes - Package sets of bytes into blocks preceded by character
counts and output.

ESTABLISH CODE SIZE

The first byte of the Compressed Data stream is a value indicating the minimum
number of bits required to represent the set of actual pixel values. Normally
this will be the same as the number of color bits. Because of some algorithmic
constraints however, black & white images which have one color bit must be
indicated as having a code size of 2.
This code size value also implies that the compression codes must start out one
bit longer.

COMPRESSION

The LZW algorithm converts a series of data values into a series of codes which
may be raw values or a code designating a series of values. Using text
characters as an analogy, the output code consists of a character or a code
representing a string of characters.

The LZW algorithm used in GIF matches algorithmically with the standard LZW
algorithm with the following differences:

1.  A special Clear code is defined which resets all compression/decompression
parameters and tables to a start-up state. The value of this code is 2**<code
size>. For example if the code size indicated was 4 (image was 4 bits/pixel)
the Clear code value would be 16 (10000 binary). The Clear code can appear at
any point in the image data stream and therefore requires the LZW algorithm to
process succeeding codes as if a new data stream was starting. Encoders should
output a Clear code as the first code of each image data stream.

2. An End of Information code is defined that explicitly indicates the end of
the image data stream. LZW processing terminates when this code is encountered.
It must be the last code output by the encoder for an image. The value of this
code is <Clear code>+1.

3. The first available compression code value is <Clear code>+2.

4. The output codes are of variable length, starting at <code size>+1 bits per
code, up to 12 bits per code. This defines a maximum code value of 4095
(0xFFF). Whenever the LZW code value would exceed the current code length, the
code length is increased by one. The packing/unpacking of these codes must then
be altered to reflect the new code length.

BUILD 8-BIT BYTES

Because the LZW compression used for GIF creates a series of variable length
codes, of between 3 and 12 bits each, these codes must be reformed into a
series of 8-bit bytes that will be the characters actually stored or
transmitted. This provides additional compression of the image. The codes are
formed into a stream of bits as if they were packed right to left and then







                                                                        32


picked off 8 bits at a time to be output.

Assuming a character array of 8 bits per character and using 5 bit codes to be
packed, an example layout would be similar to:


     +---------------+
  0  |               |    bbbaaaaa
     +---------------+
  1  |               |    dcccccbb
     +---------------+
  2  |               |    eeeedddd
     +---------------+
  3  |               |    ggfffffe
     +---------------+
  4  |               |    hhhhhggg
     +---------------+
           . . .
     +---------------+
  N  |               |
     +---------------+


Note that the physical packing arrangement will change as the number of bits
per compression code change but the concept remains the same.

PACKAGE THE BYTES

Once the bytes have been created, they are grouped into blocks for output by
preceding each block of 0 to 255 bytes with a character count byte. A block
with a zero byte count terminates the Raster Data stream for a given image.
These blocks are what are actually output for the GIF image. This block format
has the side effect of allowing a decoding program the ability to read past the
actual image data if necessary by reading block counts and then skipping over
the data.

Appendix
G. On-line Capabilities Dialogue.

NOTE : This section is currently (10 July 1990) under revision; the information
provided here should be used as general guidelines. Code written based on this
information should be designed in a flexible way to accommodate any changes
resulting from the revisions.

The following sequences are defined for use in mediating control between a GIF
sender and GIF receiver over an interactive communications line. These
sequences do not apply to applications that involve downloading of static GIF
files and are not considered part of a GIF file.

GIF CAPABILITIES ENQUIRY

The GIF Capabilities Enquiry sequence is issued from a host and requests an
interactive GIF decoder to return a response message that defines the graphics
parameters for the decoder. This involves returning information about available
screen sizes, number of bits/color supported and the amount of color detail
supported. The escape sequence for the GIF Capabilities Enquiry is defined as:

ESC[>0g           0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x30 0x67

GIF CAPABILITIES RESPONSE

The GIF Capabilities Response message is returned by an interactive GIF decoder
and defines the decoder's display capabilities for all graphics modes that are
supported by the software. Note that this can also include graphics printers as
well as a monitor screen. The general format of this message is:

#version;protocol{;dev, width, height, color-bits, color-res}...<CR>


'#'            GIF Capabilities Response identifier character.
version        GIF format version number;  initially '87a'.
protocol='0'   No end-to-end protocol supported by decoder Transfer as direct
               8-bit data stream.
protocol='1'   Can use CIS B+ error correction protocol to transfer GIF data
               interactively from the host directly to the display.
dev = '0'      Screen parameter set follows.
dev = '1'      Printer parameter set follows.
width          Maximum supported display width in pixels.
height         Maximum supported display height in pixels.
color-bits     Number of bits per pixel supported. The number of supported
               colors is therefore 2**color-bits.
color-res      Number of bits per color component supported in the hardware
               color palette. If color-res is '0' then no hardware palette
               table is available.

Note that all values in the GIF Capabilities Response are returned as ASCII
decimal numbers and the message is terminated by a Carriage Return character.

The following GIF Capabilities Response message describes three standard IBM PC
Enhanced Graphics Adapter configurations with no printer; the GIF data stream









                                                                        34


can be processed within an error correcting protocol:

#87a;1;0,320,200,4,0;0,640,200,2,2;0,640,350,4,2<CR>

ENTER GIF GRAPHICS MODE

Two sequences are currently defined to invoke an interactive GIF decoder into
action. The only difference between them is that different output media are
selected. These sequences are:

ESC[>1g     Display GIF image on screen

                  0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x31 0x67

ESC[>2g   Display image directly to an attached graphics printer. The image may
optionally be displayed on the screen as well.

                  0x1B 0x5B 0x3E 0x32 0x67

Note that the 'g' character terminating each sequence is in lowercase.

INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT

The assumed environment for the transmission of GIF image data from an
interactive application is a full 8-bit data stream from host to micro.  All
256 character codes must be transferrable. The establishing of an 8-bit data
path for communications will normally be taken care of by the host application
programs. It is however up to the receiving communications programs supporting
GIF to be able to receive and pass on all 256 8-bit codes to the GIF decoder
software.
