Subject: I. General questions about this FAQ

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

Welcome to another monthly release of the Graphics File Format FAQ!

I finally had a look at the WWW page for this FAQ at www.cis.ohio-state.edu
(see Subject 3: Where can I get the latest copy of this FAQ?). The Ohio State
server does an excellent job of converting this FAQ into hypertext for Web
access, but I did notice a few glitches in the text on my part--mostly to do
with URLs. These have been fixed in this FAQ release. I also picked up a few
ideas for the time when I make a true HTML version of this FAQ for the Web
(but when? but when?).

And it looks as though I'll be in the O'Reilly & Associates booth at SIGGRAPH
in Los Angles on August 8th, 9th, and 10th. I'll be the long-haired computer
nerd with the long, braided beard. ;-{)>>>>

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's new in this latest FAQ release?

  o Fixed a few URLs for the WWW version of this FAQ
  o Added another graphics-oriented mailing list
  o Added a bit of new info to the corruption section
  o Included the kodak WWW images page in the archives list
  o And I finally obtained information on the current GIF/LZW controversy

------------------------------

Subject: 2. Why does a graphics formats FAQ exist?

The purpose of this FAQ is to answer many of the frequently asked questions
about graphics file formats posted on Usenet. You will find definitions of
terms, references to format information, very general descriptions of many
formats, information on programs which read, write, convert, and display
graphics files, and some handy programming tips for writing your own code. 
This FAQ is not a substitute for actual file format specifications, nor can
it possibly go into a great amount of specific detail on graphics file
formats.

Subject: 5. I have a question, correction, or some information concerning this FAQ.

All questions, comments, additions, and corrections should be sent to the
author of this FAQ at jdm@netcom.com. I don't always read the newsgroups this
FAQ is posted to, so please contact me directly via email rather than
attempting to reach me by posting to a newsgroup. All suggestions and
contributions within the scope of this FAQ are welcome and contributors
receive full credit in the Acknowledgments section of this FAQ.

------------------------------

Subject: 6. This FAQ doesn't contain enough detail!

This FAQ only attempts to answer Frequently Asked Questions. It is not a book
on graphics file formats. It is instead a thick source of information that
will help you obtain more information that you need. Or perhaps even clear
up a few of your misconceptions and thereby saving you from wasting some
time.

------------------------------

Subject: 7. Why isn't the XXX file format covered?

If you have read and/or grepped this FAQ and not found information on the
format you need the reason might be that:

  * You are looking for the format under the wrong name.

  * This FAQ is new and the information you need hasn't been included yet.

  * I don't know about the format and I need you to email me information
    on it (See 4.).

  * The format is proprietary and its caretakers do not wish information
    on the format distributed in this FAQ.

------------------------------

Subject: 8. Why aren't audio file formats covered?

Information on file formats used specifically for storing audio data are
already covered quite nicely by a FAQ posted to comp.dsp. You may obtain
this FAQ from the Usenet newsgroups comp.dsp, comp.answers, and news.answers,
or from the FTP archive site (and mirrors):

  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/comp.dsp/

The FAQ for comp.speech may of also be of interest to audio people. It is
available at:

  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/comp-speech-faq/
  ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/FAQ-complete

------------------------------

Subject: 9. Why aren't word processing formats covered?

It is true that there are many types of file formats that cannot store
graphics data (older word processor and spreadsheet formats, and so forth). 
These formats are not within the scope of this FAQ and are therefore not
covered. Perhaps someone who works in the biz of writing file translators for
these formats will put together such a FAQ one day.

------------------------------

Subject: 10. What about multimedia file formats?

Multimedia file formats store more than just graphics data. They may also
contain audio, video, animation, and textual data in addition to bitmapped
and vectored graphics. Such formats, although a superset of graphics formats,
are considered to be within the scope of this FAQ and are therefore covered.
Also check the comp.multimedia FAQ for additional information you may
require.

------------------------------

Subject: II. General Graphics File Questions

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Who cares about graphics file formats?

Well, programmers do mostly. But end-users (that is, non-programmers) do too.

The typical end-user only cares about storing their graphics information
using a format that most graphics programs and filters can read. End-users
are typically not concerned with the internal arrangement of the data within
the graphics file itself. They only want the format to do its job by
representing their data correctly in a permanent form.

Programmers, on the other hand, are that rare breed of human that just can't
leave information well enough alone. They need to know how every byte is
arranged to see if someone knows something that they don't (and often snicker
contentedly to themselves when they find that it is really they that know
more). Programmers will then use this information to write code that may
never see the light of distribution, but nevertheless, they will have had fun
and gained enlightenment from writing it.

It doesn't matter which of these two types of people you are. If you have
even the slightest interest in graphics file formats then you may be counted
as one who cares.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What is raster, vector, metafile, PDL, and so forth?

These terms are used to classify the type of data a graphics file contains. 
Raster files (also called bitmapped files) contain graphics information
described as pixels, such as photographic images. Vector files contain data
described as mathematical equations and are typically used to store line art
and CAD information. Metafiles are formats that may contain either raster or
vector graphics data. Page Description Languages (PDL) are used to describe
the layout of a printed page of graphics and text. Animation formats are
usually collections of raster data that is displayed in a sequence. 
Multi-dimensional object formats store graphics data as a collection of
objects (data and the code that manipulates it) that may be rendered
(displayed) in a variety of perspectives. Multimedia file formats are
capable of storing any of the previously mentioned types of data, including
sound and video information.

------------------------------

Subject: 2. Why should I care about previous versions of a file format?

When version 2.0 of the XXX format is released all of the thousands of files
created using version 1.0 of the XXX format don't magically disappear or
transform to version 2.0 overnight. Although version 2.0 might claim to be
fully backwards compatible, the new specification may obfuscate or even omit
details of the previous version of the format. In short, never throw away
older information just because you have something newer. At one point in time
that "out dated" format spec was state-of-the-art, and it may still contain a
singular precious tid-bit of information that the caretakers of the format
didn't carry over to the new spec (but Murphy will make sure you desperately
need to know).

------------------------------

Subject: 3. Can graphics files be infected with a virus?

For most types of graphics file formats currently available the answer is
"no". A virus (or worm, Trojan horse, and so forth) is fundamentally a
collection of code (that is, a program) that contains instructions which are
executed by a CPU. Most graphics files, however, contain only static data
and no executable code. The code that reads, writes, and displays graphics
data is found in translation and display programs and not in the graphics
files themselves. If reading or writing a graphics file caused a system
malfunction is it most likely the fault of the program reading the file and
not of the graphics file data itself.

With the introduction of multimedia we have seen new formats appear, and
modifications to older formats made, that allow executable instructions to be
stored within a file format. These instructions are used to direct multimedia
applications to play sounds or music, prompt the user for information, or
display other graphics and video information. And such multimedia display
programs may perform these functions by interfacing with their environment
via an API, or by direct interaction with the operating system. One might
also imagine a truly object-oriented graphics file as containing the code
required to read, write, and display itself.

Once again, any catastrophes that result from using these multimedia
application is most like the result of unfound bugs in the software and not
some sinister instructions in the graphics file data. Such "logic bombs" are
typically exorcised through the use of testing using a wide variety of
different image files for test cases.

If you have a virus scanning program that indicates a specific graphics file
is infected by virus, then it is very possible that the file coincidentally
contains a byte pattern that the scanning programming recognizes as a key
byte signature identifying a virus. Contact the author (or even read the
documentation!) of the virus scanning program to discuss the probability of
the mis-identification of a clean file as being infected by a virus. Save the
graphics file, as the author will most likely wish to examine it as well.

If you suspect a graphics file to be at the heart of a virus problem you are
experiencing, then also consider the possibility that the graphics file's
transport mechanism (floppy disk, tape or shell archive file, compressed
archive file, and so forth) might be the original source of the virus and not
the graphics file itself.

------------------------------

Subject: 4. Can graphics files be encrypted?

Of course you can encrypt a graphics file. After all, most encryption
algorithms don't care about the intellectual content of a file. All they chew
on is a series of byte values. Therefore, most any encryption program that
works on ordinary text files will work on graphics files as well.

Why would you want to encrypt a graphics file? Mostly to control who can view
its contents. You can invent a proprietary file format and that might slow a
file format hack down for, say, five or ten minutes. You could add a
proprietary data compression scheme, possibly a twisted variation of an
already public algorithm. But there are so many people out there with nothing
better to do than hack at unknown data formats that your data would probably
be exposed in little time. But suppose we top off all this effort by
encrypting the graphics file itself as we would an ordinary text file. Would
your data then be safe?

Realize that an encrypted graphics file still might not be very secure. For
every data encryption algorithm there exists at least one method of getting
around it, although it may take hundreds of computers and many years to fully
employ and execute that method!

For example, one of the more popular methods used to encrypt data is the
Vernam or XOR cipher. This cipher Exclusive ORs the plain-text data with a
single, random, fixed-length key. The longer the key the harder it is to
break the cipher. A totally random key the length of your data is impossible
to break. Shorter and less-random keys are easier to break.

XOR is very simple and fast, which is a must for a graphics file
translators/viewers that must decrypt a file on the fly. A problem, however,
is that most graphics files contain fixed size headers which vary only
slightly in content from file to file. If you knew the approximate contents
of the header of an encrypted file you could XOR a "decrypted" header with
the encrypted file and possibly produce the key used to encrypt the file. A
short key might be very easily discovered in this way.

If you really need to make the contents of a graphics file secure, then I'd
suggest not only using some form of data encryption, but also create an
unconventional and proprietary file format and do not publish its format
specification.

  Bruce Schneier, "Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms,
    and Source Code in C", John Wiley & Sons, 1994.

------------------------------

Subject: 5. Can a graphics file be copyrighted?

No. A graphics file cannot normally be copyrighted under United States
copyright laws (although the rulings of some judges may disagree on this). The
specification of a format and the contents of a graphics file, however, are
subject to copyright.

For anything to be copyrighted it must be:

  1) A work of authorship
  2) Fixed in a tangible medium of expression

The description of a graphics format does meet both of these criteria (it is
fixed in a medium and a work of authorship) and is therefore protected under
the copyright laws. A graphics file created using the format description,
however, meets the second criteria, but not the first (that is, it is not
considered to be a work of authorship). The format itself is considered
instead to be an idea or system, and is therefore not protected by copyright.

So the description of a file format is copyrightable, but the format as it
exists in its medium is not. What about the graphics data that the file
contains?

If the graphical data written to a graphics file also meets the above two
criteria, then it is also protected by the copyright laws as intellectual
property. You will not wave your copyright protection by storing any original
information using a graphics file format.

------------------------------

Subject: 6. How can I convert the XXX format to the YYY format?

With a file conversion program, of course! Without a doubt one of the most
frequently asked categories of questions on comp.graphics is how to convert
one format to another. In every case the answer is some type of conversion
program or filter, but which one?

Section IV of the FAQ is an attempt to list every known graphics file display
and conversion program and application. Although far from complete, this list
may contain the program you need. Go to the subsection of the particular
operating system you are using and scan through Imports: and Exports: formats
listed and see if the formats you needs to use are there.

In some cases the information in a listing may make the conversion
capabilities of a program a bit misleading. For example, a program that can
import a vector .DWG file and export a raster .BMP file may not necessarily
be able to perform a .DWG->.BMP (vector->raster) conversion (AutoCAD R12 can,
BTW). And just because a program can both import and export TIFF files
doesn't mean it's capable of a TIFF(CMYK)->TIFF(RGB) conversion (as Adobe
Photoshop can do). As always, read the documentation, contact and ask the
author of the program, or find a user of the program and ask them.

------------------------------

Subject: 7. Do I really need the specification of the format I'm using?

It depends upon the results you are trying to obtain. If you have code that
supports the XXX format and you find it easy (and legal) to integrate that
code into your program, then you may be tempted to do so. But realize that
your program will support the XXX format in just the same way as the previous
program did. In other words, your program will now work the same, but it will
really be no better.

By obtaining the format specification you can make an attempt to fully
support all of the features and capabilities a graphics or multimedia file
format has to offer. If you use pre-written code that only supports a small
subset of the format's features then you are not doing justice to the
format and cheating your users out of functionality they might need.

Always strive to create the best programs possible within reason of time and
money. Obtain the specs, look at code, and talk to programmers who have
worked with the format before. You might gain some insight and save yourself
some hair-pulling by supporting a feature that someone didn't think to
include in the original requirements for your program.

------------------------------

Subject: 8. How can I tell if a graphics file is corrupt?

The easiest way is to display the file and decide if what you see on the
screen or the printer is correct. This method is not fool-proof, however,
because not all information stored in a graphics file is used for displaying
the data it contains. Textual comments, alternate color maps, and unused
fields in the header might be munged and go undetected.

A frequent source of corruption occurs when 8-bit graphics data is
transported via a 7-bit communications channel. The 8th bit of each byte is
cleared (set to zero) and you are left with garbage. The PNG file format
supports an elegant solution to the quick detection of this type of
corruption. The First character of every PNG file is the 8-bit value 89h. If
this value is read as 09h, the 8th bit has been zeroed and you know the file
is corrupt.

Most graphics files do not contain any real, built-in error detection
features. The standard way to check for corruption of any type of data file
is to perform some sort of error-detection scheme on the file. Such schemes
commonly used are Checksum calculations and the Cyclic Redundancy Check
(CRC).  These algorithms are commonly used in the world of synchronous serial
communications for detecting errors in data streams.

If you only wanted to provide error detection for the graphical data
contained in a file, but not the header, then a 2- or 4-byte field in the
header could be used to store the CRC-16 or CRC-32 value of the data. But
what good is pure data if the header is possibly corrupt? 

If we calculate the CRC value of the entire file and then store that
calculated value in the header we will have just "corrupted" the file! You
could initialize the CRC field with zeros, calculate the value, store the
value, and specify that the entire file need be read into memory and the CRC
value field set to all zeros before the CRC calculation is made. 

File formats that segment their data into blocks or chunks would be able to
perform a CRC on each section individually (another feature found in the PNG
file format). Each section would store the CRC value as the last 2 or 4 bytes
of the block and the CRC value field would never be read for the purpose of
the CRC calculation. This method makes it easier to find the location of the
error(s) in a file. If the CRC error occured in an unnecessary block of data,
the file might still be useful anyway. This block-style CRC checking also
saves the reader from performing a time-consuming CRC calculation an entire,
possibly very large, graphics file.

But all this can be quite a pain. Can't we avoid modifying a file and just
store the CRC value externally to the file? Maybe using some sort of
encapsulating "wrapper"?

If you want to make sure a graphics file (or any file for that matter) has
been transported through a communications channel without sustaining any
corruption, first store it using a file archiving program that supports error
checking of the files contained in the archive. (Several good error-checking
file archiving programs include PKZIP, gzip, and zoo. The ar and tar Unix
archiving programs do not support error checking). When the graphics file is
stored, the archival program calculates the CRC value of the file. If the CRC
value does not match the file's calculated CRC after it is unarchived after
transport, you know that the file has been corrupted.

Note: make sure you turn compression OFF when archiving many types of
graphics files. File archival programs use compression by default and will
attempt to make your compressed data even smaller (which usually results in
larger data, unless the archiver is smart enough to detect the negative
compression and not attempt to compress the file). ASCII-based files (such as
PostScript and DXF) and some RLE-encoded files (such as PCX) will be
compressed, while other formats supporting more advanced data compression
methods (such as JPEG and LZW) will surely grow in size.

------------------------------

Subject: 9. What do I put in my own graphics file format specification?

For people that are faced with the task of writing up a specification for
their own format (or perhaps to better document someone else's), a few
suggestions are hereby offered.

  A large spec needs a table of contents, bibliography, and an index.
  Most specs do not fall into this category though.

  On the cover sheet give the full information of your company, products
  associated with the format, the format version, date of release, 
  where the latest copy of the spec may be obtained, and how developers
  may get in contact with you to ask questions.

  Detail the full history of the spec and not just the dates of its
  revision. Tell why the format was created. Detail some insights of
  how it was designed. Speculate on what features future version might
  contain. And give the names of your developers and other people
  involved. Show the human thought that exists behind the cold chunk of
  data that is your format.

  List the features of your format and explain how you intend that it
  should be used and not used (tell what your format is and is not).
  Give the developer your reasons that they should use your format (and
  why they should not bother with others).
  
  Include both block diagrams and ANSI C code examples of the format's
  internal data structures. Illustrate actual examples of ASCII file
  format data and hexadecimal dumps of binary format data (very useful
  to programmers, I might say).

  If your format includes one or more forms of data compression, error
  checking, encryption, etc., place this information in a separate
  section and give plenty of examples (both written and code) of how
  these algorithms work. Include mathematical formulas if you believe it
  makes your concepts clearer.

  Make the specification available both in hardcopy and electronic
  form. The hardcopy version should be formatted as a technical
  document and using a font that won't degrade badly when the spec is
  photocopied or faxed. Use a standard sized page layout so the spec
  isn't a hassle to fit in an envelope when mailed. The electronic
  version should be available as both ASCII text and PostScript files.
  Making the spec available in a word processing format (such as
  Microsoft Word or Framemaker) is nice, but not absolutely necessary.

  Consider making a developer's toolkit for your format. A collection
  of benchmark graphics files (one of each flavor of your format), and
  a parser written in ANSI C that reads and writes your format, is of
  tremendous help to programmers. Such a kit will allow developers to
  implement your format quickly in their products and helps minimize
  the chances of numerous software packages appearing which create
  graphics files that don't meet your spec. Examples of formats with
  toolkits include TIFF, TGA (Truevision), and WordPerfect Graphics
  (WPG).

  Submit your specification to every FTP/Gopher/WWW site and BBS that
  archives file format specs. Notify the maintainers of related FAQs
  (graphics, animation, multimedia, audio, medical, etc.) that your
  format exists and ask for a mention. Send your literature to graphics
  and imaging software companies to sell support of your format and/or
  software products.

And a few guidelines on good technical writing in general:

  Write in a tutorial style with explanations and examples of your
  topics. Don't just give a terse, dictionary description of a topic
  which often leaves the readers confused and needing more.

  Write in simple terms. Don't assume your readers enjoy 70-word
  sentences, or have advanced degrees in mathematics or computer
  graphics. 

  Have other people read and attempt to understand your spec. Don't
  assume that just because you understand what you've written that
  every reader will too. You, as the file format specification's
  author, understand the format inside and out. Your readers, however,
  do not. An explanation that may seem clear to you may be just
  another confusing paragraph to your readers.

  Write for a world-wide audience of programmers. Omit slang or regional
  expressions that a developer living on the other side of the planet
  might not understand.

  Programs that check spelling and grammar are our friends. Use them.

Subject: 10. How do I submit a file format specification to an archive?

There are several FTP and WWW sites which act as archives for graphics file
format specifications (see the section "Graphics and Image File FTP Archives
and WWW Pages"). If you have a file format specification that is legal to
share with the rest of the world-wide Internet community, then you may wish
to submit it to one or more of these archives.

There are generally two ways to submit a file format specification to an
FTP archive:

  1) Upload (or "put") the file in the /incoming or /pub/incoming directory.
  2) Email the file to the archive maintainer (the email address is usually
     in the README or similar file in the root FTP directory).

Realize that most FTP sites don't allow unsolicited uploads and instead
require you to contact the archive maintainer to make a submission. Many
sites are simply mirrors for other archives and don't accepts any kind of
submissions at all. 

In any case, it's usually good form to include a description file with your
submission to describe in a few words what you have uploaded and where it
originated. If your upload is named foo.doc then the description file should
be named foo.txt.

Subject: V. Graphics Formats Misnomers, Misgivings, and Miscellany

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Why aren't JPEG, MPEG, LZW, and CCITT Group 3 & 4 file formats?

One of the most commonly confused concepts found in file formats is the
difference between the file format and the method(s) of data encoding that
has been used to reduce the size of the data the file contains. JPEG, MPEG,
LZW, and CCITT are all algorithms, or algorithm toolkits, which encode a
stream of data to a physically smaller size. None of these data compression
methods define a specific format used to store data. 

Several formats have become popular based on their use of one or more of
these methods of compression, such as GIF (LZW), JFIF (JPEG), and TIFF (CCITT
Group 3 and Group 4). So if you ask for a "CCITT Group 3" image file you will
most likely get a file containing only CCITT Group 3 data and not a TIFF file
containing bitmapped data compressed using the CCITT Group 3 algorithm, which
might have been what you were expecting.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. Why aren't IGES, GKS, NAPLPS, PCL, and HPGL file formats either?

IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification), GKS (Graphics Kernel System),
and NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax) are not
actually file formats. They are instead protocols which specify how graphical
data should be transmitted over a communications link (such as a telephone
line) to a remote device (such as a graphical workstation).  HPGL  
(Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) and PCL (Printer Control Language) are
data stream definition standards used to transfer and manipulate data used by
printers and plotters.

In most cases, each of these protocols define a previously existing file
format, such as CGM or JFIF, to be the actual format used to store the
graphics data (HPGL uses a raw or compressed bitmap). Occasionally the
transmitted data stream may be stored to a file for buffering or archival
purposes. This file is then often identified as using the
"{IGES,GKS,NAPLPS,PCL,HPGL} file format".

Descriptions of each of these standards may be found in Part 3 (Where to Get
File Format Specifications) of this FAQ.

------------------------------

Subject: 2. Is it "Tag" or "Tagged" Image File Format?

Revision 5.0 of TIFF specification specifically states the acronym "TIFF" is
"Tag Image File Format". The majority of people, however, intuitively say
"Tagged" rather than "Tag". Interestingly enough, the TIFF 6.0 specification
does not spell out the acronym TIFF.

------------------------------

Subject: 3. Whaddya mean there's no "Targa" file format?

The popular "Targa" file format is really the "TGA format". "Targa" is the
name of the Truevision graphics display adapter which first used the TGA
format. Specifically, Revision 1.0 of TGA is designated the "Original TGA
format" and Revision 2.0 is the "New TGA Format".

------------------------------

Subject: 4. Choosy programmers choose "gif" or "jif"?

The pronunciation of "GIF" is specified in the GIF specification to be "jif",
as in "jiffy", rather then "gif", which most people seem to prefer. This does
seem strange because the "G" is from the word "Graphics" and not "Jraphics".

------------------------------

Subject: 5. Why are there so many ".PIC" and ".IMG" formats?

Because people with very little imagination are allowed to choose file
extensions for graphics files, that's why.

But seriously, there does seem to be a proliferation of file formats with the
file extension ".PIC" (for "picture") and ".IMG" (for "image"). Other popular
extensions (in both upper and lower case) are ".RGB", ".RAW", ".ASC", and
".MAP".

My advise to you is never assume the format of a data file based only on it's
file extension. The name and the extension of any file are completely
arbitrary and therefore could be anything. This is why the most graphics file
conversion and display programs attempt to recognize graphics files based on
their internal structure and not their file name or extension.

------------------------------

Subject: 6. Is it now illegal to use CompuServe's GIF format?

It is not illegal to own, transmit, or receive GIF files (provided that no
unlicensed compression and/or decompression of the files occurs). You must
realize, however, that GIF files are not the issue. The issue is, in fact,
the LZW data compression algorithm.

In 1984, while working for Sperry Corporation, Terry Welch modified the
Lempel-Ziv 78 (LZ78) compression algorithm for greater efficiency for
implementation in high-performance disk controllers. The result was the LZW
algorithm. The world was informed of the existence of LZW by the following
journal article, published by Mr. Welch after he left the employment of
Sperry:

  Welch, T. A., "A Technique for High Performance Data Compression,"
  IEEE Computer, Volume 17, Number 6, June 1984.

In 1985, Sperry Corporation was granted a patent (4,558,302) for the Welch
invention and implementation of the LZW data compression algorithm. Since
that time, this LZW patent has been publicly available for all to see in the
US Patent Office and many public libraries, and is available through many
on-line services.

In 1987, CompuServe Corporation created the GIF (Graphical Interchange
Format) file format to be used for the storage and on-line retrieval of
bitmapped graphical data. The GIF specification required the use the LZW
algorithm to compress the data stored in each GIF file. It is very possible
that CompuServe did not check the patent files to determine whether the GIF
format infringed on any patents. Such a check would have found the Welch LZW
patent, which was then owned by Unisys as a result of their having purchased
Sperry in 1986. At that time, Unisys also did not know that LZW was the
method of compression used by the very popular GIF file format.

In 1988, Aldus Corporation released Revision 5 the TIFF file format. This
revision added a new feature giving TIFF the ability to store RGB bitmapped
data using either a raw format, or a compressed format using the LZW
algorithm. (Although the LZW algorithm used by TIFF is considered to be
"broken", it is still covered by the Unisys patent). Since 1991, in
accordance with their agreement with Unisys, Aldus has been required to place
a notice regarding the Unisys patent and its applicability to TIFF, in Aldus
documentation. The 1992 release of Revision 6 of the TIFF specification
includes this notice of the Unisys patent regarding LZW. The TIFF Revision 6
specification also recommends against using LZW to compress RGB bitmaps
stored using the TIFF format.

In 1990, Unisys licensed Adobe for the use of the Unisys LZW patent for
PostScript.

In 1991, Unisys licensed Aldus for the use of the Unisys LZW patent in TIFF.

In 1994, Unisys and CompuServe came to an understanding whereby the use of
the LZW algorithm would be licensed for the application of the GIF file
formats in software. Published information indicates that Unisys licensing
policies are as follows:

 1) Unisys considers all software created or modified before January 1, 1995
    that supports the GIF and/or TIFF-LZW formats to be inadvertently
    infringing upon its patent; Unisys will therefore not require a license
    for GIF software products delivered before January 1, 1995. Unisys will
    therefore not pursue legal actions against such pre-1995 software 
    products.

 2) However, Unisys expects developers of commercial or for-profit software
    to obtain a GIF-LZW license agreement from Unisys if, after December 31,
    1994, the developer creates new software or updates or modifies existing
    software, or issues a new release of software that supports the GIF file
    format.

 3) Unisys does not require licensing of non-commercial, not-for-profit
    software applications that support the GIF file format.

 4) With respect to TIFF, if a license is entered before July 1, 1995, there
    will be no liability for pre-1995 software with respect to that software's
    support of TIFF which uses LZW.

Unisys has drafted licenses for several different applications of the LZW
algorithm. The two license agreements of most interest in this FAQ are
applicable to software supporting the GIF file format alone and the agreement
applicable to software supporting both GIF and the TIFF file format's LZW
compression feature.


Realizing that you have many questions about GIF-LZW and TIFF-LZW licensing,
the remainder of this section is arranged in a Question/Answer format to help
convey information about this subject more clearly.

Q: Just what is this all about?
A: Unisys has asserted its claim to the ownership of the LZW compression and
   decompression algorithm. If you wish to implement LZW in a software or
   firmware application, you must arrange to pay a small royalty to Unisys
   for every software package that you sell. You do this by applying to
   Unisys for an LZW license agreement for your software.

Q: What file formats are effected?
A: GIF, TIFF, PDF, and PostScript Level II. All of these formats use, or
   can use, LZW compression. For example, a TIFF or PostScript Level II file
   may or may not use the LZW algorithm to compress the data it contains. 
   GIF files, and most PDF files, always store bitmap data that is compressed
   using LZW.

Q: How does this agreement affect my use of GIF and TIFF files?
A: It does not affect the ownership, transmission, or reception of GIF and
   TIFF-LZW files themselves. Only the software that performs compression
   and/or decompression of GIF may be effected in any way by license
   agreements. You are free to store and transport GIF and TIFF-LZW files
   without fear of legalities or cost from the Unisys licenses provided that
   any compression and/or decompression on GIF files is performed by licensed
   software, or by software products delivered prior to 1995.

Q: Which agreement do I need?
A: If your software supports only GIF then you need the GIF-LZW agreement.
   If it supports TIFF-LZW or both GIF and TIFF-LZW then you need the TIFF-LZW
   and GIF-LZW agreement.

Q: My software supports TIFF-LZW, but not GIF.
A: You still need to obtain the TIFF-LZW and GIF-LZW agreement.

Q: So if my software only supports non-LZW versions of TIFF and PS Level II
   I don't need to worry about obtaining a license agreement?
A: That is correct. Only software that is capable of using the LZW 
   algorithm requires an agreement. This includes all software that supports
   the GIF file format.

Q: What about file compression programs such as compress, PKZIP, zoo, and
   lha? Don't they use LZW too?
A: Most file compression programs use the LZ77 algorithm for compressing
   text. The LZ77 compression algorithms (and several of its derivatives)
   predates LZW by several years and is covered by its own series of patents.
   The predecessor to LZW, LZ78, is used primarily for compressing binary
   data and bitmaps. Any software that uses the LZ77 and/or LZ78 algorithms 
   without the LZW improvement is not affected by the Unisys LZW patent.
   Of the mentioned software packages, the Unix compress utility does use LZW
   and therefore requires a license.

Q: Doesn't IBM also hold a patent on LZW?
A: IBM was granted a patent (4,814,746) for use of LZW in disk drive 
   technology. This patent does not award ownership of LZW to IBM.

Q: I use LZW in my programs, but not for GIF or TIFF graphics. What should
   I do?
A: If you are not a business, and the programs are for your own personal
   non-commercial or not-for-profit use, Unisys does not require you to 
   obtain a license. If they are used as part of a business and/or you sell 
   the programs for commercial or for-profit purposes, then you must contact 
   the Welch Patent Licensing Department at Unisys and explain your 
   circumstances. They will have a license agreement for your application of
   their LZW algorithm.

Q: Where can I apply for a GIF-LZW, TIFF-LZW and GIF-LZW, PDF, PostScript 
   Level II, or any other LZW license?
A: You can write to:

  Welch Patent Licensing Department
  Unisys Corporation 
  Mail Stop C1SW19
  P.O. Box 500
  Blue Bell, PA 19424 USA

Or fax:    215.986.3090

Or email:  lzw_info@unisys.com

General licensing information may also be obtained from the home page of the
Unisys Web Server:

  http://www.unisys.com

Q: How much does a license cost?
A: For a GIF-LZW license there is a $25US non-refundable registration fee to
   start. You will then pay 0.45% of the selling price of your software per 
   unit sold per calendar quarter with a minimum of $0.10US and a maximum
   $10US per unit. For a TIFF-LZW and GIF-LZW license, the non-refundable 
   registration fee is $50US and you will pay 0.65% of the selling price of
   your software per unit sold per calendar quarter, with a minimum of
   $0.20US and a maximum of $25US per unit. The license agreement contains
   various other terms and conditions, such as those which define the field
   of use.

Q: Do I need a separate license for each GIF-using software product I sell?
A: If you sell three products that all use the GIF format, for example, then
   you will need only one license. License fees must be paid for each product
   sold.

Q: Do I need to obtain a new license if I release a new version of my
   software?
A: No. However, a license fee is required for each update, improvement, or
   enhancement of your software that is sold.

Q: What if I give my software away?
A: If you distribute for free your product directly to end-users for their
   personal use and your distributing the software is non-commercial and
   not-for-profit use and you receive no financial gain (such as Shareware
   donations, royalties for CD-ROM distributions, or as advertising to 
   attract for-profit business), then you do not need a license.

Q: But what about Shareware donations?
A: Each Shareware "payment" you receive is considered the selling price of
   that unit. Whatever a user pays to you for your GIF-using software is
   required to be included in your quarterly license fee payment to Unisys.
   However, minimum license fees per unit must be always paid.

Q: My Shareware GIF software is being sold for-profit on a CD-ROM, but I do
   not make any profit from its sale. Can I get in trouble? Do I need a 
   license?
A: The person/business that is selling your program for profit on their CD-ROM
   is responsible for obtaining the proper license. You would only need a
   license if you received any payments from the CD-ROM vendor or from users
   of your Shareware.

Q: I do not live in the United States and my software is not available there.
   Do I still need to obtain a license agreement?
A: Yes, you do. The Unisys patent has many foreign counterparts and the
   legalities of using LZW apply to most other countries in addition the US.

Q: What will happen to me if I continue to revise my GIF-using software,
   sell it for profit, and yet not bother to obtain a license?
A: Most likely, when your unlicensed program is discovered by Unisys,
   you will be notified of your need to obtain a license for your product.
   If you then fail to obtain the proper license, Unisys may seek an 
   injunction against your product including damages. You could also be 
   charged with willful infringement, which could result in treble damages.

Q: On what Usenet newsgroups is this LZW agreement being discussed?
A: You will find threads appearing on comp.graphics and other related
   graphical newsgroups. The official newsgroup where much discussion
   takes place is alt.gif-agreement.

Q: What are my alternatives to GIF and TIFF-LZW file formats?
A: The most popular alternative is JPEG compression and the JFIF file format.
   JFIF-JPEG files are smaller and store far more colors than GIF files.
   Another newer alternative is the PNG format, which is currently under
   development (see the section "PNG - Portable Network Graphics" in Part 3
   of this FAQ). PNG is unencumbered by patent licenses and has much 
   potential and promise in replacing GIF. But, most software that supports 
   PNG will likely have been written after January 1, 1995, so make sure that
   your GIF-to-PNG conversion program has the proper Unisys license.

Q: This agreement is bogus! I refuse to ever use GIF again!
A: As an end-user you are free never to read, write, or archive another
   LZW-encoded file as long as you live. As a developer you are only
   free of the legal implications of the Unisys patent if you remove any
   LZW code from your programs, including those shipped to your customers
   after 1994.

Q: Wait! I have more questions!
A: Contact the Welch Patent Licensing Department at the aforementioned
   addresses. I (the author of this FAQ) am not an employee nor legal
   representative of Unisys.

This FAQ is for all of you looking for that special display or image
conversion program to run on your system and to work with all those graphics
files you've been downloading from the alt.binaries.pictures.* newgroups for
whose-knows-what reasons.

And the world is not only Unix and Windows! This month we see the
introduction of a section of graphics file applications for the Commodore
Amiga. I know absolutley nothing about the Amiga, so you people had better
help me out with the software available. I wouldn't mind some input from the
Apple Macintosh community either.

And it looks as though I'll be in the O'Reilly & Associates booth at SIGGRAPH
in Los Angles on August 8th, 9th, and 10th. I'll be the long-haired computer
nerd with the long, braided beard. ;-{)>>>>

Subject: I. General questions about this FAQ

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

One of the reasons you are looking through this FAQ collection is most likely
to locate the specification for one or more graphics file formats. That
assumption on my part makes this file one of the most important parts of the
Graphics File Formats FAQ collection. I therefore wish to make this section
as complete as possible.

If you have any suggestions for formats to include then please email me at
jdm@netcom.com and let me know!

And it looks as though I'll be in the O'Reilly & Associates booth at SIGGRAPH
in Los Angles on August 8th, 9th, and 10th. I'll be the long-haired computer
nerd with the long, braided beard. ;-{)>>>>

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's new in this latest FAQ release?

  o Five new file format specification whereabouts added!
  o GIF and TIFF sections updated with mention about Unisys license agreement
  o More PNG information added
  o MIFF information updated

Subject: II. Where to Get File Format Specifications

This section contains an alphabetical listing of file formats, the names of
the creators/caretakers, and where to obtain the official specifications, and
a brief description of each format.

------------------------------

Subject: 0. BMP - Windows Bitmap Format

BMP is the native bitmap file format of the Microsoft Windows environment.
It efficiently stores mapped or unmapped RGB graphics data with pixels 1-,
4-, 8-, or 24-bits in size. Data may be stored raw or compressed using a
4-bit or 8-bit RLE data compression algorithm. BMP is an excellent choice for
a simple bitmap format which supports a wide range of RGB image data.

The BMP format was created and is maintained by Microsoft Corporation:

  1994 (Vol 9, Issue 10), pp. 18-22.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. CALS - Computer Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support Raster Format

CALS files are used for document imaging and therefore only store
black-and-white, 1-bit image data. CALS Type I files only store a single
image per file and the data is always compressed using the CCITT Group 4
encoding algorithm. CALS Type II files may stored multiple images per file,
the image data may be tiled, and tiles stored as raw data or as data
compressed using CCITT Group 4 encoding.

The CALS raster file format is defined primarily in the following
military standards documents:

  MIL-STD-1840A, Automated Interchange of Technical Information
  MIL-R-28002A, Requirements for Raster Graphics Representation 
    in Binary Format 

These documents may be obtained from the following sources:

Subject: 2. CGM - Computer Graphics Metafile

The current version of the CGM ANSI/ISO standard (commonly called 
CGM:1992) is:

  Information Processing Systems--Computer Graphics Metafile for the
  Storage and Transfer of Picture Description Information, 
  ANSI/ISO 8632-1992.

This standard superseded the early CGM:1986 (ANSI X3.122-1986) ANSI
standard. The CGM standard is contained in four ISO standards documents:

  ISO/IEC 8632-1:1992 Part 1: Functional Specification
  ISO/IEC 8632-3:1992 Part 2: Character Encoding

Subject: 5. DXF - Autodesk Drawing eXchange Format

The AutoCAD DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) and AutoCAD DXB (Drawing eXhange
Binary) formats are the native vector file formats of Autodesk's AutoCAD
CAD application.

DXF is probably one of the most widely supported vector formats in the world
today. DXF is rich in features, including: support for 3D objects, curves,
text, associative dimensioning, and is an easy format to parse. The DXB
format is a binary representation of a DXF file and they are usually smaller
and faster to load than the equivalent DXF file.

The latest "official" DXF revision is Release 12. However, there is an even
newer version of DXF containing several changes and additions to the format.
Apparently the specification of the latest version of the DXF format is not
yet (if it will ever be) freely available. Users are required to pay $4000US
for a license to AutoCAD in to obtain the specs for this newest release of
DXF file format.

The official specification for DXF R12 may be found in the AutoCAD Manual
Release 12:

  AutoCAD Customization Manual, Release 12, Autodesk Inc., 1992, pp. 241-81.

The specification for DXF R12 has also been released in electonic form and
is available in several of the Internet file format archives. You can also
try poking around on Autodesk's FTP site, but not much is usually there:

  ftp://ftp.autodesk.com

Many books detail the DXF format, including:

  The AutoCAD Database Book, F.H. Jones and L. Martin, Ventana Press,
    ISBN 0-940087-04-9. Order: 919.490.0062 voice.

  AutoCAD, The Complete Reference, 2nd Ed., Johnson, N., McGraw-Hill,
    New York, NY, 1991.

Subject: 7. FBM - Fuzzy Bitmap

FBM is the native file format of the Fuzzy pixmap image manipulation and
conversion toolkit written by Michael L. Mauldin at Carnegie Mellon
University.

Code to manipulate FBM (and many other) file formats is found in the
FBM distrbution:

  ftp://nl.cs.cmu.edu/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z

------------------------------

Subject: 8. GIF - Graphics Interchange Format

GIF is a data stream-oriented file format used to define the transmission
protocol of LZW-encoded bitmap data. GIF images may be up to eight bits (256
colors) in depth and are always compressed. Despite the fact that GIF
supports only 8-bits worth of colors, and the multimedia extensions
introduced in the 89a release have not been widely utilized, GIF still
remains a popular choice for storing lower resolution image data.

The GIF89a specification is available via many BBSs and on-line information
services. You may also obtain the specification directly from CompuServe:

  CompuServe Incorporated
  Attn: Graphics Technology Department
  5000 Arlington Center Boulevard
  Columbus, OH 43220
  Voice: 614.457.8600, 800.848.8199

Note: Any software created or modified after 01 January 1995 that supports
the capability of reading and/or writing GIF files must obtain a patent
license agreement from Unisys Corporation. See Part I of the FAQ for more
details on the Unisys GIF-LZW license agreements.

------------------------------

Subject: 9. GKS - Graphics Kernel System

GKS is a standard specifying the input and output primitives for displaying
2D and 3D graphical data. Although GKS has no native file format, the CGM
(Computer Graphics Metafile) format is often closely associated with its use.

The following ISO documents describe the GKS standard:

  ISO 7942    Functional Specification
  ISO 8651-1  Fortran Binding
  ISO 8651-2  Pascal Binding
  ISO 8651-3  Ada Binding
  ISO 8651-4  
  ISO 8805    GKS-3D
  ISO 8806    GKS-3D Bindings

These documents are available from ISO, ANSI, and CSA (see the CGM section
for the addresses of these organizations).

------------------------------

Subject: 10. IGES - Initial Graphics Exchange Specification

IGES is a set of protocols for the transfer and display of graphical
information on remote devices via a telephone or computer communications
network. IGES does not define any new graphical file formats, but instead
uses existing formats (such as CGM) to encapsulate graphical data.

IGES is associated with the NCGA (National Computer Graphics Association) and
is part of the U.S. Product Data Association (USPRO) and the IGES/PDES
Organization (IGO). The NCGA administers the National IGES User Group (NIUG),
which provides access to information on IGES.

To obtain the IGES specification, you must be a member of both NIUG and a
Regional Interest Group (RIG). The IGES specification is available through
the NCGA for $100US. For more information about the NIUG, RIGs, and IGES,

------------------------------

Subject: 11. IMJ - Image JPEG

IMJ was created by Pegasus Image Corporation as a variation of the JFIF file
format. IMJ is essentially a JFIF file with a Microsoft Windows BMP header
and enhanced palette optimization. The IMJ format is used in several
screensaver applications, and by orgainizations such as Delrina and the
National Center for Missing Children.

See the section describing the PIC - Pegasus Imaging Corporation Format
for more information.

------------------------------

Subject: 12. JFIF - JPEG File Interchange Format

JFIF is a data stream-oriented file format used to define the transmission of
JPEG-encoded bitmap data. The specification for JFIF may be obtained directly

------------------------------

Subject: 13. MGF - Materials and Geometry Format

MGF is an ASCII-based 3D rendering format designed to model surface geometry
and materials for the purpose of visible-light simulation and rendering.  The
overall objective of this format is to provide a very simple yet fairly
complete modeling language that does not place unreasonable demands on the
applications programmer or the object library creator.

The format specification is available bundled with an MGF file reader
and is distributed in the file mgflib0.7.tar.Z on the following sites:

	http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html
  ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/www/mgf

The MGF software is currently in an alpha release stage, which means the
language may change in some incompatible ways between now and the first
release.  Use this software and data in this package at your own risk.

Subject: 15. NAPLPS - North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax

NAPLPS is a protocol for transferring ASCII-based graphical information to
remote terminals via a communications channel (telephone systems, computer
networks, and so forth). NAPLPS is used by many Videotext services and
Prodigy, the commercial on-line information service, and is specifically
designed to provide usable information transfer rates, even at data rates as
low as 2400bps.

Although there is no NAPLPS file format, NAPLPS data streams are often saved
as files, and the files are then referred to as using the "NAPLPS file
format".

The NAPLPS specification is a standards documents available through ANSI, ISO,
or CSA. (See the CGM section for the addresses of these organizations). The
CSA document (T500-1983) also contains a supplement (1-1991) which is not
included in the ANSI version of this standard.  

Further information may be found in the February, March, April, and May 1983
issues of Byte Magazine. These articles explain much of the NAPLPS coding
system and discuss the potential for NAPLPS.

Michael Dillon has authored a paper on NAPLPS and started a NAPLPS section on
SIMTEL20.  Michael Dillon may be contacted at:

Subject: 16. NFF - Neutral File Format

NFF is a minimal scene description language used to test rendering algorithms
and efficiency schemes. It supports basic geometry of objects, surface
characteristics, placement of lights, color of objects, and the viewing angle
of the human eye. NFF is ASCII-based and is used with the Standard Procedural
Database (SPD) software package used for creating databases for testing
rendering schemes.

The specification for NFF is available on numerous FTP sites which archive
file format documents, such as:

  ftp://zamenhof.cs.rice.edu/pub/graphics.formats

and is available along with the SPD test programs, which produce NFF objects:

OFF was developed in 1986 at Digital Equipment Corporation's Workstation
Systems Engineering for the interchange and archiving of 3D objects. OFF is
an ASCII-based format and is independent of languages, devices, and operating
systems.

The specification for OFF is:

  Rost, Randi, OFF--A 3D Object File Format, November 6, 1986 (updated
    October 12, 1989).

The OFF archive is available from:

Subject: 19. PBM - Portable Bitmap

The Portable greymap file format is part of the Extended Portable Bitmap
Utilities (PBMPLUS). PBM is used as an intermediate format for storing
monochrome bitmap information generated by the PBMPLUS toolkit. PBM files may
be either binary or ASCII and store data one-bit-per-pixel in size.

Information and source code for PBM can be found in the distribution for
PBMPLUS located at:

  ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z

The specification for the PBM format can also be found in the manual page for
pbm(5) on many Unix systems.

------------------------------

Subject: 20. PCX - ZSoft Paint

PCX is one of the oldest bitmapped formats popularized by MS-DOS paint
programs that first appeared in the early 1980's. PCX files may store mapped
and unmapped image data from 1- to 24-bits in pixel depth, always contain
RLE-compressed image data, and are recognized by almost all still-image
graphics programs ever written.

But because of the kludged evolution of the PCX format (caused partly by the
efforts of Zsoft to continue to support the ever-changing world of graphics
display adapters) it is generally advised that the MS Windows BMP format be

Subject: 24. PNG - Portable Network Graphics

PNG (pronounced "ping") is a new bitmap format which is currently in
development. Its creation is an attempt to give the graphics community an
alternative to the shortcomings and misgivings found in most popular file
formats. The current legal battle involving the GIF format may also have
something to do with it too :-)

The following paragraph, excerpted from the PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
specification, eighth draft, explains the basic rationale behind the format:

  The PNG format is intended to provide a portable, legally unencumbered,
  simple, lossless, streaming-capable, well-compressed, well-specified
  standard for bitmapped image files which gives new features to the end
  user at minimal cost to the developer.
 
The PNG specification is now in its tenth draft and is currently undergoing
final editing in preparation for the 1.0 release. The PNG draft is considered
finalized to the point that software may be safely written without the worry
of the specification changing.

A public draft of the current PNG specification may be found at:

  http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/png.html

Questions about PNG may be asked on the comp.graphics newsgroup or
directed to the principle author of the PNG specification:

  Thomas Boutell
  boutell@netcom.com

PNG developers may join the PNG mailing list. Send email to
png-info@uunet.uu.net and ask for more information. A human will be reading
your request to join the list, so make it good.

PNG materials can be had in great profusion by anonymous FTP from:

  ftp://godzilli.cs.sunysb.edu

All programs on this site are in beta test and should be used carefully. In
the case of questionable implementation, the specification is to be
considered corrent and the code in error.

Subject: 25. PPM - Portable Pixmap

The Portable pixmap file format is part of the Extended Portable Bitmap
Utilities (PBMPLUS). PPM is used as an intermediate format for storing color
bitmap information generated by the PBMPLUS toolkit. PPM files may be either
binary or ASCII and store pixel values up to 24 bits in size.

Information and source code for PPM can be found in the distribution for
PBMPLUS (see the section on the PBM format for information on PBMPLUS). The
specification for the PPM format can also be found in the manual page for
ppm(5) on many Unix systems.

Subject: 26. POL - InnovMetric Software Polygon Models Format

POL is the native 3D file format for software products created by InnovMetric
Software. The POL format was created to fill the need of storing data
representing multi-contour, simple, planular, polygons using a binary file
format.

InnovMetric Software is developing a complete line of software products for
building 3-D polygonal models using a 3-D imaging system. Two of these
software tools are targeted at real-time 3-D graphics applications.
IMCompress and IMFilter are two complementary tools for optimally reducing
the number of polygons in a 3-D model. IMCompress uses a surface-based
algorithm to downsize highly redundant models such as Digital Terrain Models
and polygonal models generated by a CAD or a 3-D imaging system. IMFilter
uses a volume-based algorithm to create ultra-compact models (20 to 500
triangles) for level of details management in applications requiring
real-time 3-D graphics.

The POL file format specification is primarily distributed as Appendix B of
the IMCompress User's Guide published by InnovMetric Software. The
specification is also available in PostScript format as the file pol.ps in a
few of the graphics file format specification archived listed in part 1 of
this FAQ.

POL was created and is maintained by:

Subject: 28. RAS - Sun Rasterfile

Sun rasterfile is the native bitmap format of Sun Microsystem Unix systems.
The rasterfile format has become more wide-spread with the growing popularity
of the SunOS operating system and Sun SPARCStation family of Unix
workststaions.

Sun rasterfiles store images up to 32 bits in pixel depth and support a basic
for of run-length data compression.

The primary source of information for Sun Rasterfiles is the SunOS include
file /usr/include/rasterfile.h and the rasterfile online manual page:

  Sun Microsystems, rasterfile (5), Sun OS 4.0 Programmer's Manual, 1990.

The following jounal article is devoted to the Sun rasterfile:

Subject: 33. SHG - Segmented Hyper-Graphic

SHG is a file format used by Microsoft in the WinHelp on-line help facility
found in Windows 3.1. This format is used to save a Microsoft Bitmap (BMP) or
Windows Metafile (WMF) graphic and store the coordinates of specific areas of
the bitmap known as "hotspots".  When the bitmap is displayed and the user
selects a hotspot, WinHelp jumps to another part of the help documentation
via a hyper-text link macro stored in the SHG file.

Another file format used with SHG files is the Multiple-Resolution Bitmap
(MRB) format. MRB files contain one or more SHG images, each rendered at a
different resolution. Several SHG files are typically created using the
SHED.EXE utility and then fed into the MRB compiler to create a single MRB
file. When WinHelp reads the MRB file it chooses which bitmap most closely
matches the resolution of the display.

SHG is currently officially undocumented by Microsoft, but the specification
may be found at:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/Multimedia/SHED.ZIP

Information on SHG and MRB may be found in the following journal article:

  .mrb and .shg File Formats, Windows/DOS Developer's Journal, Pete Davis,
    February 1994 (Vol 5, No 4), pp. 37-46.

Subject: 34. STL - Stereolithography Interface Format

STL files are the native file format of the SLA CAD software created by 3D
Systems of Valencia, CA, USA. STL files may be ASCII or binary in form,
although binary is far more common due to the very large resulting size of
the CAD data when saved to the ASCII format.

Subject: 41. XBM - X BitMap

XBM is a native file format of The X Window System and is used for storing
cursor and icon bitmaps that are used in the X GUI. XBM files are quite
different in that they are actually C language source files that are created
to be read by a C compiler rather than a graphical display program.

XBM data is typically found in headers (.h files) and are a series of static
unsigned char arrays containing the monochrome pixel data. There is one array
per image stored in the header.

XBM was created by the X Consortium as part of the X Window System. Refer to
the /bitmaps directory of the X Window distribution for examples of XBM
files. The central FTP distribution site for X version 11 is:

  ftp://ftp.x.org

Subject: 42. WMF - Windows Meta File

WMF is the native vector file format for the Microsoft Windows operating
environment. WMF files are actually a collection of GDI (Graphics Device
Interface) function calls also native to the Windows environment. When a WMF
file is "played back" (typically using the Windows PlayMetaFile() function)
the graphics is rendered. WMF files are device-independant and have no limit
to their size.

Most books on Microsoft Windows programming contain sections on the internals
of WMF files. The Microsoft Knowledge Base (available at ftp://microsoft.com
and on the Microsoft Developer Network CD) also contains the complete
specification of WMF. I also highly recommend the book:

Subject: 44. XPM - X PixMap

XPM is a defacto standard for storing monochome, gray-scale, and color pixmap
data to disk under the X Window system. XPM files, like XBM files, are
C source code files, with each pixmap being defined as a static char array.

The XPM format was created through the work of the KOALA Project at Groupe
Bull Research. Questions about XPM may be directed to:

Subject: 45. XWD - X Window Dump

XWD is used to store screen dumps created by the xwd client process in the X
Window System. The image of any window or the background may be saved (dumped)
to an XWD file. Using the following command:

  xwd -root > bg.xwd

The background is saved to the file bg.xwd. By replacing the "root" flag with
the ID of a window, only that window will be saved to the XWD file.

XWD was created by the X Consortium as part of the X Window System. Refer to
the /usr/include/X11 directory for header files (XWDFile.h) that define the
X10 and X11 versions of the XWD format.  The central FTP distribution site
for X version 11 is:

  ftp://ftp.x.org

Subject: I. General questions about this FAQ

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

Programmer's are code-hungry people. They just want the secrets and they want
them to work NOW! But always in the back of a hack's mind there are the
questions: "Is this really the best way to do this? Could it be better?".

This FAQ is to share ideas on the implementation details of reading, writing,
converting, and displaying graphics file formats. You'll probably get some
good ideas here, find a few things you didn't know about, and even have a few
suggestions and improvements of you own to add (send them to jdm@netcom.com).

If you need to know the best way to do something with file formats, or just
find it embarrassing to implement a chunk of some other programmer's code and
then have to admit you really don't understand how it works, then this FAQ is
for you.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's new in this latest FAQ release?

A few more file identifiers have been added, but that's all. This is truly
the most neglected part of this FAQ. I'm gonna hafta start stifting through
comp.graphics more frequently to fill this part out, I guess.

Subject: II. Programming Tips for Graphics File Formats

------------------------------

Subject: 0. What's the best way to read a file header?

You wouldn't think there's a lot of mystery about reading a few bytes from a
disk file, eh? Programmer's, however, are constantly loosing time because
they don't consider a few problems that may occur and cause them to loose
time. Consider the following code:

  typedef struct _Header
  {
    BYTE Id;
    WORD Height;
    WORD Width;
    BYTE Colors;
  } HEADER;

  HEADER Header;

  void ReadHeader(FILE *fp)
  {
    if (fp != (FILE *)NULL)
      fread(&Header, sizeof(HEADER), 1, fp);
  }

Looks good, right? The fread() will read the next sizeof(HEADER) bytes from a
valid FILE pointer into the Header data structure. So what could go wrong?

The problem often encountered with this method is one of element alignment
within structures. Compilers may pad structures with "invisible" elements to
allow each "visible" element to align on a 2- or 4-byte address boundary.
This is done for efficiency in accessing the element while in memory. Padding
may also be added to the end of the structure to bring it's total length to
an even number of bytes. This is done so the data following the structure in
memory will also align on a proper address boundary.

If the above code is compiled with no (or 1-byte) structure alignment the
code will operate as expected. With 2-byte alignment an extra two bytes would
be added to the HEADER structure in memory and make it appear as such:

  typedef struct _Header
  {
    BYTE Id;
    BYTE Pad1;      // Added padding
    WORD Height;
    WORD Width;
    BYTE Colors;
    BYTE Pad2;      // Added padding
  } HEADER;

As you can see the fread() will store the correct value in Id, but the first
byte of Height will be stored in the padding byte. This will throw off the
correct storage of data in the remaining part of the structure causing the
values to be garbage.

A compiler using 4-byte alignment would change the HEADER in memory as such:

  typedef struct _Header
  {
    BYTE Id;
    BYTE Pad1;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad2;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad3;      // Added padding
    WORD Height;
    WORD Width;
    BYTE Colors;
    BYTE Pad4;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad5;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad6;      // Added padding
  } HEADER;

What started off as a 6-byte header increased to 8 and 12 bytes thanks to
alignment. But what can you do? All the documentation and makefiles you write
will not prevent someone from compiling with the wrong options flag and then
pulling their (or your) hair out when your software appears not to work
correctly.

Now considering this alternative to the ReadHeader() function:

  HEADER Header;

  void ReadHeader(FILE *fp)
  {
    if (fp != (FILE *)NULL)
    {
      fread(&Header.Id, sizeof(Header.Id), 1, fp);
      fread(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);
      fread(&Header.Width, sizeof(Header.Width), 1, fp);
      fread(&Header.Colors, sizeof(Header.Colors), 1, fp);
    }
  }

What both you and your compiler now see is a lot more code. Rather than
reading the entire structure in one, elegant shot, you read in each element
separately using multiple calls to fread(). The trade-off here is increased
code size for not caring what the structure alignment option of the compiler
is set to. These cases are also true for writing structures to files using
fwrite(). Write only the data and not the padding please.

But is there still anything we've yet over looked? Will fread() (fscanf(),
fgetc(), and so forth) always return the data we expect?  Will fwrite()
(fprintf(), fputc(), and so forth) ever write data that we don't want, or in
a way we don't expect? Read on to the next section...

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's this business about endianness?

So you've been pulling you hair out trying to discover why your elegant and
perfect-beyond-reproach code, running on your Macintosh or Sun, is reading
garbage from PCX and TGA files. Or perhaps your MS-DOS or Windows
application just can't seem to make heads or tails out of that Sun Raster
file. And, to make matters even more mysterious, it seems your most
illustrious creation will read some TIFF files, but not others.

As was hinted at in the previous section, just reading the header of a
graphics file one field is not enough to insure data is always read correctly
(not enough for portable code, anyway). In addition to structure, we must also
consider the endianness of the file's data, and the endianness of the
system's architecture our code is running on.

Here's are some baseline rules to follow:

  1) Graphics files typically use a fixed byte-ordering scheme. For example, 
     PCX and TGA files are always little-endian; Sun Raster and Macintosh
     PICT are always big-endian.
  2) Graphics files that may contain data using either byte-ordering scheme
     (for example TIFF) will have an identifier that indicates the
     endianness of the data.
  3) ASCII-based graphics files (such as DXF and most 3D object files),
     have no endianness and are always read in the same way on any system.
  4) Most CPUs use a fixed byte-ordering scheme. For example, the 80486
     is little-endian and the 68040 is big-endian.
  5) You can test for the type of endianness a system using software.
  6) There are many systems that are neither big- nor little-endian; these
     middle-endian systems will possibly cause such byte-order detection
     tests to return erroneous results.

Now we know that using fread() on a big-endian system to read data from a
file that was originally written in little-endian order will return incorrect
data. Actually, the data is correct, but the bytes that make up the data are
arranged in the wrong order. If we attempt to read the 16-bit value 1234h
from a little-endian file, it would be stored in memory using the big-endian
byte-ordering scheme and the value 3412h would result. What we need is a swap
function to change the resulting position of the bytes:

  WORD SwapTwoBytes(WORD w)
  {
      register WORD tmp;
      tmp =  (w & 0x00FF);
      tmp = ((w & 0xFF00) >> 0x08) | (tmp << 0x08);
      return(tmp);
  }
  
Now we can read a two-byte header value and swap the bytes as such:

  fread(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);
  Header.Height = SwapTwoBytes(Header.Height);

But what about four-byte values? The value 12345678h would be stored as
78563412h. What we need is a swap function to handle four-byte values:

  DWORD SwapFourBytes(DWORD dw)
  {
      register DWORD tmp;
      tmp =  (dw & 0x000000FF);
      tmp = ((dw & 0x0000FF00) >> 0x08) | (tmp << 0x08);
      tmp = ((dw & 0x00FF0000) >> 0x10) | (tmp << 0x08);
      tmp = ((dw & 0xFF000000) >> 0x18) | (tmp << 0x08);
      return(tmp);
  }

But how do we know when to swap and when not to swap? We always know the
byte-order of a graphics file that we are reading, but how do we check what
the endianness of system we are running on is? Using the C language, we might
use preprocessor switches to cause a conditional compile based on a system
definition flag:

  #define MSDOS     1
  #define WINDOWS   2
  #define MACINTOSH 3
  #define AMIGA     4
  #define SUNUNIX   5
  
  #define SYSTEM    MSDOS
  
  #if defined(SYSTEM == MSDOS)  
    // Little-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == WINDOWS)  
    // Little-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == MACINTOSH)  
    // Big-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == AMIGA)  
    // Big-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == SUNUNIX)  
    // Big-endian code here
  #else
  #error Unknown SYSTEM definition
  #endif

My reaction to the above code was *YUCK!* (and I hope yours was too!).  A
snarl of fread(), fwrite(), SwapTwoBytes(), and SwapFourBytes() functions
laced between preprocessor statements is hardly elegant code, although
sometimes it is our best choice. Fortunately, this is not one of those times.

What we first need is a set of functions to read the data from a file using
the byte-ordering scheme of the data. This effectively combines the read\write
and swap operations into one set of functions. Considering the following:

  WORD GetBigWord(FILE *fp)
  {
      register WORD w;
      w =  (WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF);
      w = ((WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF)) | (w << 0x08);
      return(w);
  }
  
  WORD GetLittleWord(FILE *fp)
  {
      register WORD w;
      w =  (WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF);
      w = ((WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF) << 0x08);
      return(w);
  }
  
  DWORD GetBigDoubleWord(FILE *fp)
  {
      register WORD dw;
      dw =  (DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF);
      dw = ((DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF)) | (dw << 0x08);
      dw = ((DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF)) | (dw << 0x08);
      dw = ((DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF)) | (dw << 0x08);
      return(dw);
  }
  
  DWORD GetLittleDoubleWord(FILE *fp)
  {
      register WORD dw;
      dw =  (DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF);
      dw = ((DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF) << 0x08);
      dw = ((DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF) << 0x10);
      dw = ((DWORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF) << 0x18);
      return(dw);
  }
  
  void PutBigWord(WORD w, FILE *fp)
  {
      fputc((w >> 0x08) & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc(w & 0xFF, fp);
  }
  
  void PutLittleWord(WORD w, FILE *fp)
  {
      fputc(w & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc((w >> 0x08) & 0xFF, fp);
  }
  
  void PutBigDoubleWord(DWORD dw, FILE *fp)
  {
      fputc((dw >> 0x08) & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc((dw >> 0x10) & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc((dw >> 0x18) & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc(dw & 0xFF, fp);
  }
  
  void PutLittleDoubleWord(DWORD dw, FILE *fp)
  {
      fputc(w & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc((w >> 0x08) & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc((w >> 0x10) & 0xFF, fp);
      fputc((w >> 0x18) & 0xFF, fp);
  }

If we were reading a little-endian file on a big-endian system (or visa
versa), the previous code:

  fread(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);
  Header.Height = SwapTwoBytes(Header.Height);

Would be replaced by:
  
  Header.Height = GetLittleWord(fp);

The code to write the same value to a file would be changed from:

  Header.Height = SwapTwoBytes(Header.Height);
  fwrite(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);

To the slightly more readable:

  PutLittleWord(Header.Height, fp);

Note that these functions are the same regardless of the endianness of a
system. For example, the ReadLittleWord() will always read a two-byte value
from a little-endian file regardless of the endianness of the system;
PutBigDoubleWord() will always write a four-byte big-endian value, and so
forth.

------------------------------

Subject: 2. How can I determine the byte-order of a system at run-time?

You may wish to optimize how you read (or write) data from a graphics file
based on the endianness of your system. Using the GetBigDoubleWord() function
mentioned in the previous section to read big-endian data from a file on a
big-endian system imposes extra overhead we don't really need (although if
the actual number of read/write operations in your program is small you might
not consider this overhead to be too bad).

If our code could tell what the endianness of the system was at run-time, it
could choose (using function pointers) what set of read/write functions to
use. Look at the following function:

  #define BIG_ENDIAN      0
  #define LITTLE_ENDIAN   1

  int TestByteOrder(void)
  {
      short int w = 0x0001;
      char *byte = (char *) &word;
      return(byte[0] ? LITTLE_ENDIAN : BIG_ENDIAN);
  }

This code assigns the value 0001h to a 16-bit integer. A char pointer is then
assigned to point at the first (least-significant) byte of the integer value.
If the first byte of the integer is 01h, then the system is little-endian
(the 01h is in the lowest, or least-significant, address). If it is 00h then
the system is big-endian.

------------------------------

Subject: 3. How can I identify the format of a graphics file?

When writing any type of file or data stream reader it is very important to
implement some sort of method for verifying that the input data is in the
format you expect. Here are a few methods:

1) Trust the user of your program to always supply the correct data, thereby
freeing you from the tedious task of writing any type of format
identification routines. Choose this method and you will provide solid proof
that contradicts the popular claim that users are inherently far more stupid
than programmers.

2) Read the file extension or descriptor. A GIF file will always have the
extension .GIF, right? Targa files .TGA, yes?  And TIFF files will have
an extension of .TIF or a descriptor of TIFF. So no problem?

Well, for the most part, this is true. This method certainly isn't
bulletproof, however.  Your reader will occasionally be fed the odd-batch of
mis-label files ("I thought they were PCX files!"). Or files with
unrecognized mangled extensions  (.TAR rather than .TGA or .JFI rather than
.JPG) that your reader knows how to read, but won't read because it doesn't
recognize the extensions. File extensions also won't usually tell you the
revision of the file format you are reading (with some revisions creating an
almost entirely new format). And more than one file format share the more
common file extensions (such as .IMG and .PIC). And last of all, data streams
have no file extensions or descriptors to read at all.

3) Read the file and attempt to recognize the format by specific patterns in
the data. Most file formats contain some sort of identifying pattern of data
that is identical in all files. In some cases this pattern gives and
indication of the revision of the format (such as GIF87a and GIF89a) or
the endianness of the data format.

Nothing is easy, however. Not all formats contain such identifiers (such as
PCX). And those that do don't necessarily put it at the beginning of the
file. This means if the data is in the format of a stream you many have to
read (and buffer) most or all of the data before you can determine the
format. Of course, not all graphics formats are suitable to be read as a data
stream anyway.

Your best bet for a method of format detection is a combination of methods
two and three. First believe the file extension or descriptor, read some
data, and check for identifying data patterns. If this test fails, then
attempt to recognize all other known patterns.

Run-time file format identification a black-art at best.

------------------------------

Subject: 4. What are the format identifiers of some popular file formats?

Here are a few algorithms that you can use to determine the format of a
graphics file at run-time.


GIF: The first six bytes of a GIF file will be the byte pattern of 
     474946383761h ("GIF87a") or 474946383961h ("GIF89a").

PNG: The first eight bytes of all PNG files are 89504e470d0a1a0ah.

Sun: The first four bytes of a Sun Rasterfile are 59a66a95h. If you have
     accidentally read this identifier using the little-endian byte order
     this value will will be read as 956aa659h.

TIFF: The first four bytes of a big-endian TIFF files are 4d4d002ah and
      49492a00h for little-endian TIFF files.
