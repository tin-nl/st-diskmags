The new Falcon GEM shell was programmed by Janez Valant (who is also
responsible for the nice little Dominos game this issue).  It was
developed in GFA Basic and uses external applications to display the
GIF and view the text.  My thanks to him, if you have access to IRC
then look out for him - his handle is SWE.
