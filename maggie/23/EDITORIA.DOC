                 Maggie Team hits the ground limping!
                (But limping 50% faster than before!)

Thursday,  the  Thursday  before  release..  Crimewatch on  the  tele, 
Killing Joke on the CD, coffee in my belly, nothing in my head..

Ummm....

Well it's been an interesting,  not to say traumatic couple of months, 
with  a veritable skipful of 'technical difficulties' afflicting  us.. 
The  original editorial I was going to write for this issue  has  been 
binned,  along with the panic-stricken and stressed out follow-up that 
might have emerged had it been written in April when I was Falconless.

Now  all  the  convolutions of the past few weeks have  died  down,  a 
strange  calm  has descended foglike down on to the Maggie  GHQ..  The 
couriers  oddly  protracted  non-delivery antics  don't  seem  so  bad 
anymore  as once they realised there was a problem,  they seemed to be 
very  eager to help..  The chap at TUS (Dave Escott) really seemed  to 
know what he was doing to make my Falcon better,  and I've got it back 
and it's worked fine, upgrade and all, since..

To put it simply, I don't feel the need to scream anymore..

It might be a different story for Mr Pink though,  as his Falcon is in 
the  throes  of  mystery  SCSI failure  syndrome,  and  so  far,  much 
headscratching  with no positive news is taking place..  It might well 
be  sorted out by the time this issue goes out,  but our thoughts  and 
best wishes go with him in the meantime..

                           ---------------

If you ignore the preceding paragraphs and go straight to the rest  of 
this  issue  of Maggie,  you might conclude that quite a lot  of  good 
things have taken place since the last issue of Maggie was released.. 

We  have  a detailed review of the troublesome object of  our  desire, 
Nemesis,  at the same time,  detailed write-ups of the Atari Shows and 
the  Siliconvention  are  to be found in these pages..  Of  more  than 
casual interest is the re-emergence of two keenly awaited games on the 
Falcon,  Running and Willy the Adventurer, which are now a lot further 
on than before..  

Demo  coders haven't been slack,  with huge signs of life seen at  the 
Siliconvention, and the new generation of demos headed by our very own 
Tat and the Avena gang, all getting a close look in here as well..

Of  interest  to  those people who follow the  external  picture  more 
avidly,  there has been a change of government here in the UK.. I make 
no  apologies  for  discussing this subject,  as it is as  decisive  a 
political sea-change as the 1979 election which took Margaret Thatcher 
into  power..  Many  changes  to  how the UK  is  governed,  and  even 
perceived from abroad, are taking place as we write..

This had quite a lot to do with the strange comments at the  beginning 
of the text,  where the new Labour government promised they would "Hit 
the ground running.." 

The  actual  election process itself was a dismal  and  unenlightening 
affair,  but  aptly  covered in our campaign scrapbook..  Of even more 
aptness  and  lightning  skill with the keyboard is  our  newest  team 
member, Jody Smith who took it all several steps further on by running 
a local member of parliament ragged on the telephone.. The results can 
be seen in here for the first time!!

If this is not enough,  we have articles keyed in by the hands of John 
Weller,  ex-editor  of  ST  Enthusiasts Newsletter  (STen),  and  even 
Richard  Karsmakers,  probably  the most famous diskmag editor of  all 
time, and ex-editor of the now very dead ST News..
 
This is only the briefest list of what is bursting to be read in  this 
issue,  which  is  probably one of the most stuffed to bursting  point 
ones  we've ever done..  In that respect,  the problems we've had have 
helped in giving us a bit of extra time to work that little bit  extra 
into  Maggie,  giving  you even more to read than the normal  'several 
hours worth' quoted by reviewers elsewhere..

In  a  couple  of days,  I'm going to Dave  Hollis's  get-together  in 
Northampton..  This  will just be an informal mess-around writ  large, 
and I'm going to slob around with my Falcon and a wadful of games  and 
demos over at his place..

Then I'll finish this lot off and get it out on the airwaves at last!

One  final thing,  we hope you find our very late April Fools joke  in 
this issue in time!!
