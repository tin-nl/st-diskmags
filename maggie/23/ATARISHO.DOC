
                       Atari Show - Spring '97!

The Monday after...

Oh dear, and back to reality, what were we up to over the previous two 
days?  Let's  have  a  look at what's left of Dave  Hollis's  realtime 
article to see..

Well,  there's  this  rather emphatic phrase from Saturday morning  to 
start with,

  Maggie Team are HARD!! - We don' need no tablecloths!!

Then a rather strange comment from me,

  09.59 - Felice's stereo only seems to be 50% there anyway? - CiH

- I remember that one of the speakers decided not to work, rather than 
Karl  Brandt  deciding  to  take a chainsaw to  it,  as  this  comment 
seems to imply!

There was this extremely unforgettable statement soon after.

   Hello  to everyone at the Brum show from the top  SHAGger..  Jeremy     
   Beadle' 

Errr!  - Leading to a proliferation of weak 'Beadles About' type jokes 
perhaps?

Someone  who thought he was at an Amiga event is vividly described  in 
this next excerpt??

   11.10 - (Mike Gray) arrives at the Atari show only to be told by  a 
   bloke  going  in that "it's shit mate,  worse than  last  year".... 
   thankfully I wasn't here last year,  so I've got nothing to compare 
   it with. TBH I'm quite impressed.

Here's some information from the realtime that we rather was not given 
out so freely..

   12:48 Heaven 17 use a falcon in their stage show (if anyone  cares) 
   (Mike)
      
There was thankfully at least one good joke in there..

  13:43 - Three engineers.  Chemical Engineer, Electrical Engineer and 
  Microsoft  Engineer.  They're driving along when their  car  breaks 
  down.  Electrical engineer says "let's strip the car down, check the 
  wiring,  see what the problem is".  Chemical engineer realises it's 
  not  really  his  thing,  but  says  that  the  Petrol  could  have 
  emulsified,  and says so.  The Microsoft engineer says,  let's close 
  the car windows,  get out of the car,  get back in again and see if 
  the car works then.. <mike>

I don't think this one was a comment about my inadvertent and constant 
'bugfinding' for the ST+ shell, but then again...

  16:13 I blame that CiH chap myself ;) - Keefy

This  one  might have been referring to Dave 'Norman  Bates'  Hollis's 
unhappy  hobby of dangling dismembered bits of the original Star  Trek 
cast from his kitchen ceiling!?!

 15.06  Ere Dave,  are you a Trekkie,  whats with the badge on  your 
 monitor?

 15:07  - Hmmmm,  visit my house...all you need to know  is  hanging 
 there ;))) - Dave...

And this almost final comment from the founder of the realtime article 
might just reinforce our worries about his sanity!

  OH!,  Anyone know a quick way to wade through almost 2000 Megs worth 
  of data hehehe!  hohoh!  wibble de fee...I'M GOING LOOPY AT THE MERE 
  PROSPECT ;)) - Dave...

Oh dear, is that all that's left of it.. I suppose I'll have to try to 
write some kind of report as well..


...Two Days before...

Ring  The Upgrade Shop (TUS) to ask if they have received  my  Nemesis 
Bodged  Falcon..   A  pleasant  and  soothingly  voiced  man  (whom  I 
eventually spot at the show on the TUS stand) explains that they  have 
got  my  Falcon,  but with about fourteen other machines,  it will  be 
awaiting  attention  until after the shows as they have to  get  about 
fifteen  hundred other things ready,  and it is a tall order with only 
two days to go before the show (My exaggeration, not theirs.)

Bollocks, no Falcon, no issue 23 Atari Show preview..


...Two Days before, evening...

Have an idea, yes, it does sometimes happen, amazingly enough.. 

Remember  that  the ST Highway 'Dens Shell',  a semi-custom TOMS  type 
effort  is lying around..  A quick study reveals an easy to alter data 
file  to list the articles,  the only other things needed are a bit of 
sector editing to remove most of the references to Jake Nicholls  from 
the  shell,  and  a  four colour .PI2 picture..  That morning,  I take 
delivery  of a disk with an enigmatic non-smiley disk label..  This is 
from  Ed  'not  now going to the show' Cleveland,  but he has  done  a 
brilliant Maggie Team group portrait in the style of his Donkey Island 
graphics  instead..  These  are  all damn realistic,  just go  to  the 
'Maggie  Team' article in the editorial menu just to see what I  mean, 
after you have finished this article.. 

This converts amazingly well down to four colours and becomes the main 
menu  picture  of what was to become a one-off 'Maggie 23  Bodge  Show 
Preview' production.. 

Work  starts  at around 10.30pm,  and shortly after 1.00am,  an  early 
version  with  60-odd  articles is ready to  roll..  Fine  tuning  and 
finishing off take place on Friday the day before the show..


...Saturday, early...

Felice   turns  up  around  7.30am,   with  no  alarm  clock   related 
complications,  just  an awful lot of rain as I hustle my monitor  and 
bag  containing my black painted STFM into his car..  The ancient  'FM 
has recently had the mouse ports sorted out by Dave Hollis,  and so is 
useable with the bodge Maggie preview.. It will probably be the oldest 
and  cheapest machine at the show,  set alongside the huge tower cased 
Hades, Afterburned Falcons, and DirecT60 power towers on show..

The journey is damp and misty,  but thankfully incident free,  bearing 
in  mind recent troubles on road journeys with mystery  phone  callers 
and  Irish  sounding accents,  and we arrive shortly  before  9.00am.. 

Stepping  in and out of puddles to unload,  we find our table next  to 
Dave  Hollis  and Pete Augustin,  representing the ST+  diskmagazine.. 
They  have been here for a whole hour before us,  and already have the 
beginnings  of what was to be quite a substantial realtime article  up 
and  running..  We set up,  thankful that there seems to be a bit more 
space  than  the last time at Birmingham,  and chat to Dave  and  Pete 
awhile.. Chairs are more in evidence this time, we we manage to remain 
seated  for  most  of  the day  (exhibitors  perogative!)   unless  we 
voluntarily got up to see the rest of the show..

I add to the realtime text, check out the new improved (yet again) ST+ 
shell,  which  now has a 256 colour photochrome picture gallery,  give 
Dave  and  Pete  a pre-doors opening  preview  of  the  Siliconvention 
winning  Sonoluminescencz  demo..  Jaws suitably drop to  the  opening 
squeals  of Tommy's fantastic music,  and don't fasten themselves back 
to  the  upper parts of their faces until the demo is well  and  truly 
over..  I  also seem to have volunteered myself as an inadvertent bug-
tester for the new shell, as it crashes whilst I am browsing, and does 
so,  no less than four times during the day.. Dave looks progressively 
less happily in my direction as time goes on and the errors pile up..

One  early visitor to our stand was Karl Brandt of  System  Solutions, 
with a pleading 'keep the noise down' look in his eye..  The excessive 
volume of the Maggie stand,  famous at the previous Autumn Shows, does 
not  become  an issue anyway,  as Felices' hi-fi decides not to  fully 
deliver,  so  any  demos and modfiles are 'pumped'  rather  discreetly 
through the monitor, which is a bit of a let down in that department.. 

In  a  'It's  not quite ten o'clock yet' sense,  Kev  Dempsey  appears 
suddenly  at  our stand..  A quick 'hair-check' reveals  a  favourable 
outcome for a little bet laid down with Kev 'Taff' Davies, which means 
that  the quantity of my lunchtime drinking is set to increase at  his 
expense..

A  large  quantity of other people follow him in,  with our  remaining 
team  members not expected to show much before 11.00am..  However Leon 
and Tash arrive a little while before eleven,  Leon is getting Nemesis 
fitted to his Falcon the sensible way.. He goes to Titan Designs stand 
to  see  what messrs Encill and Murphy are up to,  and gets  stuck  to 
their  stand  for quite a while..  He picks up one or two  interesting 
bits of info from them on the way..

   The  three  different rumours about what  happened  to  'Bad  Mood' 
   which I heard during the day.. 

1.  Doug  Little  has virtually managed to finish Bad Mood,  with  bad 
guys,  full collision detection and everything, but refuses to release 
it yet.. (This may have been confused with (2) below..

2.  Doug Little has indeed started to port 'Quake over to the Falcon.. 
This  is a complete game to start with,  rather than the step by  step 
approach  of 'Bad Mood'..  The existence of this was verified by  Leon 
O'Reilly  who also confirmed that it ran in a dirt slow fashion  on  a 
standard (Nemesised?) Falcon, but was more playable on an '040 powered 
Afterburner..  Interestingly,  the  guys  at Titan/BSS reckon that  ID 
Software  had not done a particularly brilliant job with the  original 
game code,  and there was substantial room for improvement there.. The 
source was a port of the PC code,  with only the specific code for the 
Falcon video display changed at this stage!

3.  (Closer to the truth..) Bad Mood has stalled, the only likely work 
on  it in the near future is to come on the audio part of  the  game.. 
There  has been little input from the other groups supposedly  working 
on this project who come stumbling away with a headache trying to work 
on from Doug's routines anyway..

Also  work on Apex Alpha is well advanced,  with a likely release date 
of  around  two  months,  and a preliminary version of Apex  Audio  is 
reported to be extremely impressive too..

On  our  right,  is  the Atari UK User Groups stand,  manned by  Harry 
Sideras and Chris Crosskey with a large crowd,  mainly of Wessex Atari 
Group (WAG) members clustered around, and some people from a new group 
with the disturbing acronym of 'SHAG',  and their leader Jeremy Beadle 
(no kidding!) describing himself as the 'Shagmaster' - Oh dear.. 

A PC with the 'MagiC' operating system sits disturbingly close to  our 
strictly  purist  Atari  hardware..  This  took  the  place  of  Chris 
Crosskeys 'bag of bits' hybrid ST, seen in more familiar circumstances 
at the WAG meet..  No punches were thrown either by Felices Falcon, or 
my rustbucket at the interloper as far as we knew?

I take time away from the stand to chat to an extremely friendly Steve 
Delaney  on  the Floppyshop stand,who sympathises with  my  Falconless 
predicament..  We  have  access to a review copy of Power Up,  the new 
Czech  racing  game,  which should hopefully appear in here  for  this 
issue..

Back  at the stand,  Tat and several other people travelling with  him 
have  arrived..  A  new and debugged version of 'Sonoluminescencz'  is 
loaded  onto Felices hard drive..  A reasonable crowd gathers as it is 
played out in all its slightly revamped glory..  Quite a lot of people 
who have a very old version of this demo,  own up to seeing this post-
party  version for the first time,  and they are very impressed,  even 
from a standpoint of knowing largely what to expect..

There  was a massive animation playing on several stands..  The  Atari 
Computing  magazine  logo turned into a giant  space-station  sort  of 
thing..  It  is interesting to note that Tat's hard-coded DSP  effects 
take  up just over 1 meg,  and the whole demo can even run from floppy 
drive!  This animation is around twenty-five meg and certainly doesn't 
run from a single HD floppy!!

Comment  of  the day came from Steven Moore about  Sonoluminescencz,

 - "Mmmm, is it a compressed animation!?"

Colin  Fisher Mcallum and Si Gardner turn up,  and after a brief  chat 
with Si, I don't see a lot of them again..

Arnel  (Neil) and Taff (Kev Davies) turn up..  Taff takes one look  at 
Kev  Dempsey's  hair  colour,  realises he owes me a pint  of  noxious 
alcoholic liquid, and screams..

At  some point shortly after,  we abscond to the bar/restaurant  area, 
dodging puddles as we go.. Some faint watery mumbling sounds come from 
one  of the deeper looking puddles and it becomes apparent that it  is 
still heavily raining,  and that not all the showgoers were successful 
in their quest for overpriced food..

...No Tiger Bitter!..

This  may have been for the best..  I order a strong lagery substance, 
and  a bottle of extremely toxic looking fermented apple juice  to  go 
with  it..  When the mixture reached the right level of cloudiness,  I 
drank it as quickly as my stomach lining permitted.. 

Sitting at our extended table is Chris Crosskey,  who offers a free go 
into his mountain of chips,  so we do..  Taff reveals some of his more 
degenerate habits by dunking chips into his Guinness!  Apart from that 
throat  gagging interlude,  the next hour passes by pleasantly enough, 
and it is with some regret, and hastily downed drinks, that we go back 
to the show..

Other  things  we  get  to try out once  we  return,  are  the  superb 
'Running' Doom clone for the Falcon..  This has come on miles from the 
year  old  Symposium  preview,  and  is a very packed  level  full  of 
incident  and  interest..  Only a little time to go to the  full  game 
now..  More of this game is seen on Sunday.. Also, we get an exclusive 
preview  of  Leon' new N*nt*nd* G*m*b*y Emulator for the  Falcon  (all 
vowels deleted to protect Leon from rabid corporate lawyers!) This  is 
running B*bbl* B*bbl* with an enhanced soundtrack!  The emulation does 
not  touch the Falcon Audio sub-system,  so the DSP is left to its own 
devices  and is therefore free for things like enhanced  audio..  More 
about this some other time when it is finished, which will be shortly!

We  see more of Arnel in this post-bar visit afternoon period,  as  he 
revels  in some of the software wealth to hit our hard drives,  and he 
stops and chats with us awhile.. 

In  this slower afternoon period,  people gradually start to leave  to 
make  their long train journeys home,  and the show is visibly winding 
down after 3.00pm..  It is not too much of a surprise to see that many 
stallholders  are pulling the tablecloths from their stand  at  around 
5.00pm,  and  as Dave Hollis and ST+ are leaving,  we decide to do the 
same..

After some small initial confusion over which motorway would  actually 
be the best to take us home..  A rain-laden but otherwise easy journey 
home follows..


...Sunday, almost too early, but not quite...

Shortly before 7.00am, get up, wash/dress etc..

Around 7.00am,  phone rings and a panicky sounding Dave Hollis reports 
that  his  transport arrangements for the London Show  have  dissolved 
overnight  into  a  pile  of kack..  I am  partially  ready  for  this 
situation  as Dave had initially expected problems on that  front  for 
Saturday, but was okay on that day..

Felice  turns  up at 7.15am,  and is programmed with his  new  mission 
objectives  fairly  quickly..  I take his gear with mine down  to  the 
show..  He goes to Northampton to pick up Dave and Pete Augustin..  As 
the  weather is much nicer than the preceding rather  rainy  Saturday, 
and  as there is not too much traffic about,  a pleasanter than  usual 
journey to Osterley follows..

Shortly  before  9.00am,  arrive at the Four Pillars Hotel,  spot Matt 
Smith who then helps me unload.. What a nice chap he is!

We  are  in the same place as last year,  with the user groups on  the 
raised  stage area..  There seems to be a bit more user group presence 
than  at the previous show,  as we have to squeeze three machines onto 
one  just  about adequate table..  Felice and the rest arrive  shortly 
thereafter,  and unload as though their life depended on it,  which it 
did..  Happily to say though, ten minutes before the doors opened, the 
ST+ realtime article was running once more,  which confirmed that they 
were ready and kicking..

Almost before we are aware of the fact,  it is 10.00am,  and the doors 
open again..

As was the case last year,  the London show is more of a 'public' day, 
although  several  faces  known  to us did  turn  up,  and  will  make 
themselves known during the course of this text.. In the meantime, the 
first object of interest is Matt Smiths Nemesised Falcon, which he did 
manage  to  install himself without any of the  ghastly  complications 
that  I had to put up with..  Whilst this is running,  I learn several 
useful  tips from him..  Especially to coldboot the Falcon in order to 
run without Nemesis, once the upgrade has been switched on.. 

Nemesis  does really make a difference to several 3-D based  games  on 
the Falcon.. I get to try out Moon Games, which is now silky-smooth in 
updating  the screen,  and Bad Mood,  which also definitely is greatly 
improved  from  running on a standard 16mhz set-up..  There  are  also 
favourable reports for Gravon,  Steel Talons,  and even Lasers and Men 
is  now  much  more playable than it was..  Of demos,  only  the  less 
specifically  written  stuff  will  run,  such as the  Mini  F1  demo, 
anything  that uses timers heavily would probably not work..  There is 
enough  there  for me to eagerly await the long delayed return  of  my 
Falcon to working and Nemesised order due shortly..

In return,  we impress Matt with our new offerings but don't quite get 
around  to seeing how 'Running' works under Nemesis..  Obnoxious  demo 
mercifully stays in its box until late afternoon this time..
 
One  early and faithful face that pays a visit is John Hayward of  the 
WAG zone (check out his handy upgrade-busting recycling guide also  in 
this  prog!) He takes great interest in the scene on our  table,  even 
checking out some of the Bodge Maggie preview which was on show  again 
today..  Whilst  he  is  doing this,  I am making more  progress  with 
'Running',  concluding  that  is  is a damn big level,  and the  final 
release will be well worth getting when it appears.. Several other WAG 
faces,  (Roy)  and  the  notorious  SHAG turn up  today,  including  a 
reappearance of the 'Shagmaster',  Jeremy Beadle! The talk on the User 
Groups stand is of the Atari Virtual Web, and HTML related stuff..

As the stage gets a bit infested with people, I decide to take a quick 
tour of the hall, settling upon Daves 'wedged in the corner splendour' 
of  a stand that was ST+..  Strange to say,  I don't get to knock over 
ST+  today,  but Dave is lurking with a camera,  and threatens to come 
over and take pictures.. So I leave again..

On the Floppyshop stand, I come across John Weller, who is helping out 
Steve Delaney,  so at last I get to meet the man behind STen,  and who 
has  recently come back to life on the general Atari scene..  Some  of 
his views can also be found in this issue of Maggie as well!  He seems 
to  have been having a good time,  in spite of being made to dress  up 
smartly for the occasion by Liz!

...Official Product info type stuff...

Sorry, not a lot of it in this report, which self-consciously goes for 
the  more personal and anecdotal perspective..  However,  you might be 
interested to know about Titan getting Apex Alpha nearly ready, sorry, 
already  done  that  one..  Okay,  Floppyshop showing new versions  of 
Positive  Image,  new  CD-ROMs,  and the racing game 'Power-Up'..  Ah, 
might be some more news on these elsewhere as well..

Okay,  how about The Upgrade Shop (TUS) releasing an internal 2.5 inch 
IDE  drive  kit  for  the STe..  Yes,  it just about fits  inside  the 
standard  case,  and  is  priced at 99 ukp,  including the hard  drive 
itself.. They also said something on Dave's realtime article about the 
possibility of releasing a 256 colour graphics add-on for the ST,  but 
this is very early days for that, and depends on things like some kind 
of  perceived external interest in the thing before they get going  on 
it..

I  think we saw Towers II on Jaguar cartridge,  and some of the CD-ROM 
games as well?

We  did  see most of the usual players there,  System  Solutions,  The 
Console Shop,  16/32,  Hisoft, Atari Computing, and even Brad Koda and 
his  incredible unfolding suitcase..  BeST electronics being the  only 
thing  to unchain Kev Dempsey's wallet on the Saturday as they  always 
seem  to keep some unimaginable item of Atari trivia that no-one  else 
can think of.. (And that Kev likes to purchase!)

Retiring to the bar for a while, I come across two unlikely people who 
go under the names of Paz and Bun,  who made themselves known to us at 
the  previous London show,  by shoving a small notepad in our  faces.. 

This,  they  called a realtime article which subsequently appeared  in 
the  lost  Kelstar  magazine..  Talking with them and  drinking  is  a 
pleasant enough way of passing the time now..

Back in the main hall,  and sometime in the mid-afternoon period, I am 
back  on Dave H's stand,  when another familiar and scarey face smiles 
its twisted smile at me.. It is Tronic!

He  has a sizeable entourage,  one of whom is his rather tasty looking 
sister,  and  they  stop with us a while..  Back at the Maggie  stand, 
Tronic confesses that he has never seen a Falcon demo before..  I take 
him  straight to the top with Tats Siliconvention  masterpiece,  which 
hadn't been shown for at least, oh, an hour or so! 

Tronic  is suitably impressed,  as is the vision of loveliness that is 
related to him..  She asks if it could be done on his PC,  to which he 
replies yes it could, in a quietly self confident manner.. 

She  then  asks  if he could do that himself,  and he has  to  concede 
defeat on that one..

After  getting some drinks in,  they go off to take in the rest of the 
show,  leaving  me giving the names and addesses of all the good games 
producers to some Canadian or American gentleman working on behalf  of 
the  'Current  Notes'  publication..  Both Running and  Donkey  Island 
spring to mind here for some reason!

Gareth Smith cleverly squeezes in at this point in the text, getting a 
reduced rate afternoon admittance,  and showing the amazing durability 
of the average Atari user these days..

It  is 5.00p,  or 17.00h if you please,  before the show starts to die 
down..  Unlike Birmingham, packing up does not take place until we are 
nearly  at the official 'doors closed' time of 6.00pm..  I am to  take 
Dave  Hollis  and equipment home,  Pete Augustin has made his own  way 
home via Kings Cross station a bit earlier anyway and does not need  a 
lift back with us.. 

After  a  bit  of clever packing and planning,  we are  ready  to  go, 
leaving  Felice  and Matt Smith in the process of  daisychaining  hard 
drives again..

...Journey Home...  

A  lot  easier  and less stressful than the  last  London  visit..  We 
followed  the  same  directionless diversion sign,  but knew  what  to 
expect  this time..  The fact that the evening was pleasant and  sunny 
helped a lot more..  Dave H stuck his head out of the window to boggle 
at  the  low  flying airliners on their  final  approach  to  Heathrow 
airport..  Even the M25 did not present any problems, and not too much 
time later, we were home.. 

...And finally.. 

Another  worthwhile and well attended show..  Certain aspects I  would 
have  enjoyed  a  bit more,  if I had a properly organised  Maggie  23 
preview,  and a fully functioning Falcon to run it on..  As always,  a 
great couple of days to catch up on some very good friends, meet a few 
new people, and remeet a few others who have been out of the limelight 
for a little time..

This  show  was a much more significant event for Dave Hollis,  as  he 
managed  to  put  in  a presence for the full  two  days,  and  ran  a 
successful realtime article from his stand as well..  We both provided 
each  other  with a focus,  and some friendly rivalry,  and some  much 
needed bugtesting for his next issue!

From  the  organisers point of view,  the response was good enough  to 
promise  more shows later in the year for the same venues..  The third 
weekend  in  October  being the likeliest date - watch  out  for  more 
press releases in these pages!
