
           Miscellaneous Mailed responses to Eezi-PC Maggie.

It  is gratifying to see a positive response to our  recently  produced 
anti-PC special issue of Maggie, albeit that only the extracts from the 
first couple of letters are real, the rest of it is blatantly made up!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly,  this one in from a slightly bemused John Weller,  formerly of 
'STen'  magazine,  the  serious diskmag addicts read of choice back  in 
1991..

Dear Chris,

Thanks  for the letter,  and thanks especially for Eezy-PC - nice  one! 
But  I'm  having problems with my set-up,  and I was wondering  if  you 
could  help me out with a bit of hand-holding.  I'm using a 286 with an 
additional 512k of RAM and FIFA Soccer '97 needs 16 meg of RAM,  so why 
do I get problems when I try and load Windoze?

The man at the shop said it'd work,  and the guy next door doesn't have 
the problem,  and he's got a computer too, so maybe it's down to one of 
those virus thingies?  But it can't be; I've only got the one disk, and 
the shop said it was virus free when I bought it!  Do you think I ought 
to complain to the Trading Standards people while I'm about it?

Oh,  and  perhaps  you could wipe my arse while you're about  it!  I've 
thought  of upgrading to the new 3-ply 'Andrex '97'but a mate  of  mine 
down  the pub said that it'd be incompatible unless I had a  47mm  ring 
upgrade.  He's the expert, he should know, he reads Format Publishing's 
'Which Wipe'?

 Baffled of Bournemouth

Auntie Maggie, comforter of the bemused, replies..

Now  then,  Baffled  of Bournemouth,  it's all very easy,  but I'm only 
going to help out once,  so listen very carefully..  FIFA Soccer '97 is 
poo and not worth copying,  er buying,  as everybody knows that Germany 
wins before the tournament even starts..  You've got too much RAM,  you 
silly boy! Everyone knows that Bill Gates said that 640k was enough for 
anyone, what good will an extra 512k serve you? Get rid of it at once!! 
I'd  then  suggest  that you keep your disk wrapped up  warm  and  kept 
indoors,  as  these  viruses  are nasty little blighters  that  spread 
without  warning..  Make  sure  you don't go into public  places  after 
handling the infected disk, in case of cross-infection.. 

Finally,  much  as the thought appeals to me,  I'm far too busy to wipe 
readers  bottoms,  but  I've enclosed a copy of 'Rectum  Cache  Protect 
Utility'  which  installs almost painlessly to the  affected  area,  on 
twelve sandpaper backed diskettes! 

Happy PC owning, and wash your hands afterwards!

Secondly,  selected  extracts  of  a massive missive  from  the  rather 
stunning  and  drop dead gorgeous Jody Smith,  or at least he likes  to 
think so..

Hello Chris!

So here I sit,  2pm on a Friday afternoon with no lessons to attend and 
no  bus  to catch until 5pm.  Problems,  yes? I'm actually on the fifth 
floor of A Block,  which is affectionately known as the hair and beauty 
floor, due  to  the fact that,  err,  hair and beauty students have all 
their lessons and lectures here. It's alright and full of lots of girls 
with tons of make-up on,  housing 'bad perms' and pouting lips, but the 
heavy stench of hairspray is really something else - people are falling 
about dead all around me because of it,  which is quite a result in the 
terms of fashion.

Well  what  can I say about Eezi-PC Maggie?  Quite a bit,  so to speak. 
When I first saw that you had done a totally anti-PC edition of Maggie. 
I groaned a bit to tell the truth. I hate PC's as much as the next guy, 
but this  forever battle of whingings that seems to  emit  from  every 
orifice of the Atari community is all a bit tedious really.

So  I  loaded Eezi-PC Maggie up,  expecting the  biggest  pile-o-drivel 
ever,  but  was  totally shocked to find what was one of  the  funniest 
issues  I  have ever read!  I loved it.  There was so much in there  to 
laugh  about,  hey,  I  nearly split my sides (he said sounding like  a 
cheesy American car advertisement bloke).

Eddiecat's 'Log Your Net' TV show brought back pleasant memories of the 
first  series  of The Net,  with all the  patronising  aimed-at-fathers 
computer babble.  But hey, what was wrong with the mental girl who used 
to run about on that hill,  reviewing games and screaming a bit. I like 
girls that are nuts, and she more than qualified.

                             ------------

There was a *lot* more in this letter, but you get the gist folks!

Auntie Maggie replies..

Dear  Jody,  we  appreciated your nice words and amusing comments,  you 
know  us  well  enough by now to realise that we  would  not  stoop  to 
tedious humourless ranting in Eezi-PC Maggie.  Apart from the carefully 
controlled outburst in the editorial, the rest of the issue was clearly 
intended to entertain!

Have faith in us, and a broad grin on your face shall be your reward!!

And finally, a letter from an unexpected quarter..

 Hiya Eezi-PC possee Dudes!

I've  just  read your stonking mag,  and what a great read.  Let's keep 
those uncoooool PC Lamers down and Amiga to rool 4ever!!!!!!

I'm  writing because I don't think somethings right.  My amiga looks  a 
bit different from all my mates amigas, and they've pointed this out to 
me.  The  Amiga I've got is greyer in colour than all the other amigas, 
it's  heavier too,  and has a badge on it that says the words  'Atari', 
'520',  and  'STe'.  The  one good thing,  is that it runs your Eezi-PC 
maggie, and their amigas can't. So that must say something?

Finally, I think your being unfair about 'Amiga Deluded', it's the best 
mag  that  Future  Publishing  have  done  since  their  award  winning 
'Nintendo 64 Quick Cash-in Job Format' was released. Try colouring in a 
copy from front to back to see what I mean!

Shadow of the Beast is the killer game ever!!!!!!!!

Auntie  Maggie has a major choking fit at this point,  and is unable to 
reply to any more letters..
