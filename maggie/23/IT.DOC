The  Siliconvention  was  distinctive in having  a  large  scale  Polish 
presence  representing  the Falcon for the first  time..  Ignis  brought 
their  rather strange school of 'design' with them,  and indeed we cover 
this  elsewhere..  Shadows  had  their  day with  a  well  deserved  and 
creditable  demo,  which was only ever unfortunately going to be  second 
place against Tat's two-years-in-the-waiting DSP powered masterpiece..

The textfile that goes with the demo pleads with you to make  allowances 
as no DSP code is used..  Thus warned,  we plunge in to the main program 
file,  having been forewarned that it tends to like a 256 colour mode or 
something similar first..

The  first bit is a part that went slightly wrong..  Many people thought 
the  profusion of strange scrunched interference patterns onscreen  were 
parts  of the decrunching process,  there may even have been one or  two 
deluded  individuals who thought that it was a demo effect  in  itself.. 
However,  remembering  a  small  preview of some animated  objects  that 
Shadows sent to us, the code-literate members of Maggie are able to tell 
me  that  it  is  an animation set into  the  wrong  video  mode..  Even 
stranger, there is nothing they can do to put it right?

The music is playing from the start, a sort of fast techno-y affair, but 
not too brash.. A choral or orchestral outburst announces the appearance 
of  the title screen,  a very smart sunburst background setting for  the 
title itself..

The first effect follows smartly on with a truecolour dragon picture  in 
a  slightly  coarse pixellated resolution..  This is to  accentuate  the 
bumpmap  effect  that  splashes all over it,  as a bright  light  source 
dazzles onto the screen..

There follows some of the non-DSP based coding that Shadows were so keen 
to  warn us about,  as a series of 3-D objects appear..  We start with a 
sluggish  multicoloured  torus,  so far,  nothing too great..  Then they 
start  to make a determined effort with a bunch of objects that  can  be 
best  described as abstract sculptures made from twisted metal  tubing.. 
The  frame rate drops to a crawl with this large mass on screen,  but we 
say  top  marks  for  trying  something  different  from  the   drearily 
'compulsory'  toruses and cubes seen in a hundred and one  Falcon  demos 
down the years.. The same spirit of determination is seen in the complex 
textured  and very large 3-D vase that is the final object in this  part 
of the demo..  Oh,  and they were doing this against a proper background 
as well..

Another  bumpmap  with  a  pretty  picture  distorted  into  wavy  lumpy 
patterns, more of an invisible effect, apart from what you see affecting 
the picture..

It's  tunnel time next,  as Shadows assault our senses with a couple  of 
these  well-tried troupers..  The first is a larger-than-screen  virtual 
effort,  the  mouth  of which spins in and out of view..  The second  is 
a more traditional representative of the genre, and stays exactly in the 
centre  of  the  screen where it should be..  Made up of a  plasma  type 
texture radiating out from the centre and all..

For  the  final  major  effect,  Shadows get a  bit  cheeky  with  their 
bumpmapping,  giving  us a 3-D rotating and possibly zooming bumpmap  to 
finish  with (see tech-view for a more informed insight  which  suggests 
this  is an 18 carat gold-plated original effect for the  Falcon!)  That 
done, a final 'Vote us' piccy and greets screen to finish..

TECH VIEW by Tat: So the Poles are back again.. This demo contains some 
very nice technical  bits,  such  as  the  3D  bump-mapping  (the first 
released on the  Falcon?)  and  the  other  two  bump-mapping  effects.
However,  most  are spoiled by having quite a slow frame rate.  This is 
especially true for all the 3D object parts;  indeed  it's hard to tell 
exactly what some of the effects are.  Maybe doublescan or removing the
background would help. And please only change the  colour palette while
the screen is not being displayed!

This is a real shame because the 16-year-old coder  - yes, sixteen - is
really  talented  and  extremely  quick at turning out these demos (how 
does he do it?) I just hope he can switch to the DSP, because if so, we
have a potential "best ever" demo coder in Yonek..

Ratings..

Graphics:- 84% - Profusion of nicely drawn originals and lovely  looking 
3-D objects.. One of the better looking demos around..

Sonix:-  83% - A good soundtrack lending itself well to the  changes  in 
mood in the demo..

Gee-Whiz:-  90%  - The coder has great ambition here,  perhaps  slightly 
ahead of his ability to realise it fully at the moment.. Great bumpmaps, 
and nice, if slow, 3D as well..

Overall:-  87% - A good demo by Shadows,  not quite there with the  very 
best as yet,  but surely,  not too long now before they are? Keep up the 
good work guys!
