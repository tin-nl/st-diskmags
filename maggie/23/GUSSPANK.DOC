
         The Gus Spank ST Tips/PG Tips Help Column! - Part II

The last time I did this,  I got a rapturous reception,  and only three 
people wrote to tell me that they went insane trying to make their  own 
'Tekken' clone for the ST according to my amazingly easy to follow, but 
ultimately  pointless instructions..  The news on the PG tips compo  is 
somewhat less good,  with no response whatsover..  This means that I've 
boiled some water,  and consumed the prize teabag myself.. Very nice it 
was too, but perhaps I should have added the hot water first??

Some  more squiffy tips this time around,  we kick off first with a tip 
resurrected, er, stolen from the Blue Peter archives...

Lesley Judds 'How to make a STOS coding guru from bits lying around  in 
the kitchen'..  (With a grown-up to help with the scissors.) 
  - Blue Peter Annual 1973 -

(It  was  the  extremely  very limited print  edition,  the  one  which 
featured the now notorious "Get down,  and stop shagging my Trouser leg 
Shep!"  photo-story,  and  a harrowing account of Peter Purves and  his 
only  true friend,  the chainsaw "Mr Bluebottle" running amok with  the 
Blue Peter pets in a blood strewn carnage frenzy..)

Anyway...

'Everybody  just  loves  Tony  Greenwood,   alongside  Mr  Uri  Gellers 
amazingly   contemporary  spoonbending  antics,   and  the  miracle  of 
synthesised sound reproduction that is the Stylophone,  Tony Greenwoods 
dazzling displays on a computer keyboard are a pleasure to behold,  and 
even more so amazing as it is on a computer not due to be invented  for 
about another twelve years..'

'Many  people  will  want  to possess and  keep  their  very  own  Tony 
Greenwood,   and   here,   Lesley  shows  you  how  to  make  your  own 
quintissentially unreconstructed Northern coding God..'

'First  take  some sticky backed plastic and a  cardboard  toilet  roll 
tube,  and get a grown-up to help you with the scissors.. We don't want 
a repetition of last years 'Advent Calender cry-for-help style  suicide 
attempt  mishap'  after  all..  Cut carefully down the  middle  of  the 
cardboard  tube  and  spread it out until it  looks  like  a  flattened 
cylinder.. Then add the sticky backed plastic..'

'This  is  the  first and easy stage completed..  You may have  to  ask 
another  grown-up to cut off some of his spare facial hair..  Feel free 
to  ask,  as  this is a decade where there is too much of that sort  of 
thing  around..  Stick  this with the sticky backed plastic to make  an 
authentic  nose-wig,  some pipecleaners can be bent into shape to  form 
the  spectacles..  With  a  little  stick of Blackpool  rock  added  to 
complete  the  picture,  you have your own Tony Greenwood  diorama  and 
portable home shrine for bedroom programmers to worship at!'


Secondly,  a  combination  of two things very much in the news  at  the 
moment..

How to clone a Nintendo 64..

This  is a follow-up to the very promising,  but quickly suppressed  by 
Nintendo,  'How to grow your own SNES games from a bacteria culture'..

Since  that time,  genetic engineering and cell manipulation have  made 
great strides forward, making it possible to contemplate the previously 
impossible..  You  simply take one sheep,  (Female) take some scrapings 
from  the  surface of the N64 casing..  Then inject it into the  sheeps 
ovum, planting it back in the sheeps womb.. The patented and top secret 
anti-rejection  techniques (Frankenstein Bio Labs Inc) means  that  the 
sheep  undergoes  a normal term pregnancy and gives birth to  a  cloned 
N64, identical in every way to the 'parent' original!

Now for sheep farmers facing financial ruin,  this could be a brilliant 
way  of  rebuilding  their income,  as all you have to do is  sell  the 
cloned  N64s on the black market for a lesser price than  Nintendo  are 
charging for the official article... (Really smart farmers can get away 
with  charging  even more than Nintendo's official price  by  labelling 
them 'organically produced in a cruelty free environment', which is the 
surest way to get into the Islington mums pocket!)


A  lateral approach to the topic of emulation of classic computers  now 
follows..

Useful  emulation  tips,  or how to do so,  without using a PC or going 
anywhere near the Internet..

Emulation  of  classic computers without special software on a  PC,  or 
even without having to go online is a feasible, and enjoyable pastime.. 

This  involves  learning a whole new set of skills,  such as  'cupboard 
surfing',  and  relearning  old  forgotten skills such as  getting  the 
volume  level  just right on an audio cassette player..  On  the  minus 
side,  this sort of 'emulation' destroys the 'One Box Neatness' of just 
having  everything in a desktop PC,  and you'll need to resurrect  that 
old portable telly as well.. On the other hand, emulation of just about 
anything from a humble ZX81, to the sub-150mhz Pentium you chucked last 
week is possible..  It just depends on what old hardware you have lying 
around,  as  you may be rather restricted trying to emulate an  Amstrad 
CPC 4128 with just a 48K Spectrum, which is somewhat silly, and outside 
of the scope of this article, so don't try it!

A lot of power sockets and a steady hand is always a good idea too..


Is there time for another one, I think there is!

Lending  a  sympathetic ear,  helping out a bereaved konsole kid  whose 
PlayStation isn't the dogs testicles anymore..

Now your younger and less wise friend Darren,  who likes to spend hours 
on his expensively acquired console games collection, may be despondent 
at the news that his PlayStation is suddenly cheap and shopworn looking 
beside  the newly released Nintendo 64..  Sony's heartless and tactless 
price  reduction does not frankly help matters,  so he must be  feeling 
gutted that he is now seen as second rate by his peer group.. 

Now  you  might think that anyone who defines his whole  self-worth  in 
terms  of the expensive electronic consumer goods that he  relentlessly 
purchases,  and doesn't ever quite manage to enjoy, deserves everything 
that  he gets..  You might well feel very much tempted to go around  to 
his house to indulge in a bout of mockery and ironic pseudo-sympathetic 
banter..

Well  go  right ahead!!  The little dweeb has been asking for it,  ever 
since  he first got the thing and aimlessly spent all his time  showing 
off  his slowly learned 'special moves' on Tekken..  He always liked to 
allude to the fact that it was his rich parents who forked out for  the 
constant  stream of new games for it,  and how he had all the new games 
as  soon  as they were released..  Now the chickens have come  home  to 
roost in a big way matey!  It's your turn to laugh loudly and twist the 
knife in..  Squirm with embarrassment and see if I care,  'cos I don't! 
Hahahahahahahah!!! Laaaamer!! Ha ha ha ha!!


Next Time?

Building a functioning artificial intelligence from a yoghurt pot and a 
few  other  household ingredients,  and probably some more abuse for  a 
deserving person or group in society?
