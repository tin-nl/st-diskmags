
                    VARIOUS COMMENTS ON MUSIC
                   made by Richard Karsmakers


 Over  half a year has come and gone since last those few of  you 
who  might be interested had a chance to read my remarks on  what 
has become available in the music scene of late, back in ST NEWS. 
Well,  fear not, for I have returned here to tell you which music 
ought  to be checked out if one is not to become someone  totally 
devoid  of what in my opinion I consider a passably  decency  and 
width in musical taste <grin>.
 Harken...

Cradle of Filth - "Dusk..... and her Embrace" (MFN)

 Gosh,  what  a  racket these guys make...but it's  probably  the 
coolest  racket  I've heard in a very  long  while.  Dubbed  "the 
definitive black metal album" by the collected music  press,  for 
once  I  would  unequivocally  and  wholeheartedly  refrain  from 
protesting   against  these  usually  money-driven  utterings   - 
"Dusk.....  and  her Embrace" is definitely a fine album that  no 
metallian worth his salt should be without.

 But  let me try to throw together an interesting  hotchpotch  of 
reasons and arguments to defend the previous paragraph which,  by 
all means,  should have been a conclusion appended to the end  of 
any decent CD review.

 For starters,  it should be said that I hate Darkthrone and most 
other crap which pretends to be black metal - bands of which  the 
members  paint  themselves in ghastly pale  immitations  of  Gene 
Simmons  and King Diamond,  some of which even turn  to  torching 
churches. The whole black metal scene is a behemoth bursting with 
self-importance  and overt seriousness.  They should  concentrate 
more on their music and rather less on their image,  whatever  it 
may be. It's cool to have an image that involves darkness, death, 
or even Satan if need be,  but to me personally it's  unimportant 
to know whether the singer likes virgin's blood or just claims to 
like it. It is the music that counts.

 I don't really know how serious Cradle of Filth take themselves. 
I do know that I recently spoke with a few former members (now in 
The Blood Divine,  band of ex-Anathema vocalist Darren White) who 
all  struck me as OK,  friendly and sane people.  Image is,  like  I 
said,  only important to a certain degree.  Even Gwar - a  pretty 
extreme and hilarious band,  image-wise - would not quite be what 
they are if they didn't make decent heavy metal music as well.

 Cradle  traverses well beyond what is decent heavy - or black  - 
metal. It is clear that all musicians really know what to do with 
their  instruments,  and they do it well.  On top  of  that,  the 
atmosphere of the music radiates purest velvet darkness.  One can 
almost imagine a dark fluid oozing from the CD player tray  where 
the disc whirs and whirs - a dark,  corroding fluid that gnaws at 
hearts and chokes lungs.  I don't know what the cause is -  maybe 
minor chords,  or pentaphrygian harmonies,  whatever. The subject 
matter  - litanies of damnation,  death and the darkly  erotic  - 
probably helps, as well as the moody, darkly symbolic artwork.

 To describe Cradle's music is quite a challenge.  Basically it's 
a  kind of neo-classical fast doom metal with  gothic  influences 
with  bits  of thrash thrown in for good  accord  and  distinctly 
black metal lyrical themes. The music matches the lyrics well, in 
a  way  that I would almost - with hesitance  befitting  -  label 
"beautiful".  Excellently produced,  Cradle of Filth presents you 
with darkly composed litanies over virtually poetic lyrics. I got 
the  CD  not  too long ago and I've been coming back  to  it  for 
more...and more.  It's been quite a while ago since I've been  so 
taken by one CD, in a kind of "love at first sight" way.

 But,  wait, before you run to your record shop, there's a catch. 
It's a fairly major one,  although I managed to get to grips with 
it:  The vocals.  Although parts are intoned in a dark voice  and 
female  spoken  parts thrust the music to even  higher  climaxes, 
most  of the vocals are sung in a typically black metal  style  - 
screaching,  high, positively throat-annihilating. This mere fact 
should  tell  you  that the music  must  be  simply  unbelievably 
majestic - which it is.

 An added bonus is the fact that none other than Venom's Cronos - 
rabid  captor  of bestial malevolence - performs a  rallying  war 
speech at the very end of the final song,  "Haunted Shores".  The 
album captivates from the beginning to the final notes,  with the 
possible  exception of a short instrumental,  "The  Graveyard  by 
Moonlight".

 Cradle of Filth, much like olives, is an acquired taste. It will 
prove  difficult for most people to learn to appreciate  most  of 
the  vocals,  but  once  these are coped with  you  will  find  a 
succulent,  er,  musical heart within,  throbbing with a scarsely 
veiled passion. A-may-zing.

Entombed - "DCLXVI To Ride,  Shoot Straight and Speak the  Truth" 
(MFN)

 It  was  1993  when  Entombed  released  their  previous  album, 
"Wolverine Blues".  It was a pretty OK album,  although the hard
core  fans  considered  them having sold  out.  For  four  years, 
Entombed  fans  have  had to make do with the  fellow  Swedes  of 
Dismember, a band that sounds uncannily like Entombed.

 But  Entombed is back.  Back with new bassist J”rgen  Sandstr”m, 
back with an album going by the slightly strange name of  "DCLXVI 
To Ride,  Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth". I had not expected 
much of a change in their musical direction,  and in that respect 
I wasn't even slightly disappointed.

  There  are four different versions of the  album.  There's  the 
regular  one  (14 tracks),  the  musicassette  (14  tracks),  the 
double-digipak  CD version (14 tracks plus 4 more on  the  second 
CD) and a double LP (14 tracks plus 6 more). The bonus tracks are 
all   covers  of  various  songs  the  Entombed   members   like, 
appropriately identified as "Family Favourites".  I hope the  two 
tracks  that are only available on vinyl will make it onto  a  CD 
single  in the near future.  It baffles me why they didn't  throw 
them  on  that second CD right away.  At least they  (the  record 
company) didn't release bonus shit six months after the  original 
release (like Sepultura "Chaos A.D." and even worse, "Roots", and 
of  course  the My Dying Bride re-release of "The Angel  and  the 
Dark River").

 Let's start with the covers:  I like 'em. They are "Kick out the 
Jams"   (MC5),   "21st  Century  Schizoid  Man"  (King   Crimson, 
unexpected),  "Bursting Out" (Venom,  hell yeah!) and "Under  the 
Sun" (OK Black Sabbath track). They sound typically Entombed now, 
which I suppose is producer Tomas Skogsberg's doing. Whatever may 
be the case,  they sound cool. And the "At War with Satan" teaser 
at  the  end of "Bursting Out" made me jump  with  near-orgiastic 
joy...

 The album itself,  like I hinted at above,  could be  "Wolverine 
Blues   II".   More   accessible  than  "Left  Hand   Path"   and 
"Clandestine", but still quite brutal. I really like it, though I 
don't  know  what caused the band to use  audience  samples  from 
Cheap Trick's "Live at Budokan" to add to "Parasight". Maybe it's 
something  literary  -  I'll be buggered if  I  know  (excuse  my 
French).

  My biggest hangup with the album is a small one:  What with  it 
being  a deluxe double-digipak,  it is too thick to fit  into  my 
(and  I  suppose most other) CD  storage  systems.  But,  agreed, 
that's splitting hairs.  Entombed are back,  and they still  kick 
arse. Make way again, Dismember!

Jarre, Jean Michel - "Oxygene 7 - 13" (Sony)

 I've got a lot of stuff by Jean Michel Jarre. I started off with 
the old CDs, but in the mean time I've got 'em all, including the 
videos (some of which,  most notably the "Concerts in China" one, 
are  pretty  awful).  I am one of those  weird  (and  wonderful?) 
people who insist on keeping their collection complete.  For  me, 
being an "all or nothing" kind of person, it would be unthinkable 
to have 12 Jarre albums (including the live ones) and then not go 
out and buy the new one.

 Perhaps this should change.  "Chronologie",  the album  released 
before this new one,  wasn't too brilliant already.  And the  one 
before that, "Waiting for Cousteau", was pretty good but had this 
weird  40+ minute deedle-doodle new age kind of thing  which  was 
eye-shuttingly boring.

 The  problem  I  have with "Oxygene 7 - 13"  is  that  it  lacks 
originality.  Jarre  must have decided to examine the old  sounds 
and effects he used on his debut album (1976's "Oxygene") and use 
them all again.  So there's the roaring sea again,  the same kind 
of  rhythms,  all  the  same  stuff,  with  marginally  different 
compositions  (with  lead lines that sometimes  sound  remarkably 
like Vangelis tunes!). The word that springs to mind is "boring", 
with the exception of one or two songs.

 Had  the original "Oxygene" never been released,  21 years  ago, 
this would have been a fairly good album. Now, however, it's just 
more  of the same.  The only thing really new about it is the  3D 
effect  created  by the CD cover in combination  with  the  jewel 
case.

 A bit of a bummer.
