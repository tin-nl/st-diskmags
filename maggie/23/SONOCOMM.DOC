                                                   by Mr. Pink

If 1996 was the year of a severe Falcon demo famine, then the Siliconvention was
our equivalent of Live Aid.  Mr.  Coke  took  the  role  of  a German Bob Geldof
(difficult to envisage, I know) with his battle  cry of "just give us your f-ing
competition entries! There are DSPs starving out there!"

The Atari coders dug deep into their  programming pockets and produced some fine
entries, ample sustenance for the demo hungry.

The Atari scene fill its belly in  a  "Kevin  Pressman meets the pies" style. It
had shed its Kate Moss image and  was  putting  on  the pounds. But not only was
there a fine spread, there was an item  on  the menu that turned the meal into a
banquet. A demo that broke new boundaries.

If we look back over all  the  demos  released  on  the Atari they fall into two
distinct categories. The leaders  and  the  followers.  The  originators and the
imitators. The creators and the copiers.

Arguably the first ever ground breaking demo was The Slideshow demo by Tex which
removed the bottom border to put a scroller in it. At least 500 other intros and
demos then did this, some put  some  more  flashy  effects in the bottom border,
some just put some static graphics  there,  but  the  main impact of this effect
came when you first saw it on  the  Tex  demo. They were the originators heading
into unknown territory - others simply followed the trail they had beaten down.

Tex again pushed boundaries with the BIG demo, then removed some more borders on
the Amiga demo. Level 16 then managed to remove all borders on the collaborative
"Union Demo", a demo which became the template  for demos on the ST for the next
five years.

TCB were the other real innovators on  the ST, especially with their development
of Sync-Scrolling. The Cuddly Demos still  stands  as  a landmark in demo coding
history.

I would argue that there were few, if  any, other landmark demos on the ST. Sure
there were demos that looked nicer, sounded nicer, were better presented and had
better effects, but they didn't break boundaries as Tex and TCB had.

The early Falcon demos broke new  ground, especially Sanity's "Terminal Fuck-up"
which brought the rotating zoomer  to  the  Atari owner's consciousness although
pedants would argue that this  effect  had  already  been  done by Karl of Delta
Force on the ST. The zoomer  was  much  copied  and  is sadly still appearing on
demos now.

Whilst a lot of early Falcon  demos  seemed  to  consist of tarted up ST effects
which perhaps a true colour picture thrown  in  for good measure, the arrival of
Lazer changed things.  "Warum"  was  the  first  decent  multi-part  demo on the
Falcon. It was  well  presented,  had  nice  haunting  music  and  some original
effects. With "Autowaschen Verboten" they  attempted  to  cram every demo effect
ever into one demo and succeeded in filling everyone's internal IDE drives.

EKO then  took  the  mantle  of  innovators  with  releases  like  "Papa  Was  A
Bladerunner" and "Are You Experienced"  introducing  us  to Z-Buffering and some
fast DSP based 3D.

Avena and Digital Chaos had been  bubbling  away nicely too, the former bringing
the tunnel effect to the Falcon (a crime they haven't yet been punished for) and
the later releasing "Built In  Obsolescence".  BIO  was well designed, had great
music but  was  perhaps  a  bit  let  down  by  the  actual  effects  which were
technically good but a bit slow - rather like the recent Shadows demo.

It was the Fried Bits 3  in  1995  that  everything came to head. Avena released
their "demo with no name" which, although not breaking any new boundaries, had a
good range of interesting effects and some  new stuff (the rippling water at the
end springs to mind) as well as another great Tommy tune.

The real breakthroughs though came from Inter, Lazer and EKO.

Inter, Absence and TSCC  got  together  to  create  "Terrorise  Your Soul" which
crammed more effects into 96k  than  was  thought  to be physically possible. No
96ktro has yet exceeded this in terms of quantity or quality.

Lazer's "Lost Blubb" broke new ground by being a well designed techno demo. Sure
we'd had "Cycedlic Knockout" and "Grotesque",  but 'Blubb' worked better because
it had a strong theme running through the demo. Martina also looked considerably
better than the chap in  'Knockout'  who  waved  his  hands  in  the air (and he
certainly "just didn't care").

The effects and coding in "Lost  Blubb"  are  not  the  best you will see on the
Falcon, but it is very effective because of  the way everything is linked to the
superb music.

EKO-System stunned the Falcon world on its release. It was quite simply the best
coded demo on the Falcon, the first one to really overheat the DSP by pushing so
many polygons around. The 3D worlds were superb and have yet to be beaten.

Although it was well presented, it perhaps lacked a bit of design.

Some of the early effects were  nicely  timed  to  the music, but for the entire
second part of the  demo  the  camera  just  trundled  you  around an admittedly
impressive 3D world. It would have  better  if  this  had been more dynamic with
some intercutting or scene changing.

Still Eko-System stood proudly on top of the  Falcon demo pile for two years. It
collar stood starched up and it raised  its  Gallic features to sneer at all the
others who vainly tried to wrestle it down from the podium.

The crew who have probably come  closest  are  EXA  who have done some very nice
things with the DSP, but didn't made the giant leap forward that EKO did.

For a time it looked like Eko-System  would  never be beaten, that demos of this
quality were a thing  of  the  past,  that  the  limits  of  the Falcon had been
reached. How wrong we were.

For a demo to become a landmark  demo,  it  can't simply ape old effects  and do
them better. It has to do things  that  weren't thought possible. It has to have
the ability to amaze you. It has to send shivers up your spine.

Avena's new demo "Sonoluminszenz"  clenches  its  massive  fist. With an elegant
swing it punches Eko-System full in the face and knocks the French demo from the
podium. Sono then climbs into the top spot wearing an Endsleigh sloganed T-Shirt
and grinning like Wallace after a cheese binge.

But why is Sono such  a  good  demo?  Why  does  it  provoke such a jaw dropping
reaction from all who see it?

Sono does have  some  technically  brilliant  effects,  but  not  only  are they
technically good but they also  look  superb  -  environment mapping for example
always looks great, especially with well designed objects.

The demo has some new ideas like  the  sea  at  the start and the spinning tree.
Even when old effects such as a  tunnel  are  used,  they are presented in a new
way.

Sono seems to have a soul  -  its  not  just cubes, triangles and lines floating
about a black screen.  There  are  dolphins,  trees,  bees,  fish, heads and the
ocean. Objects like these  are  much  more  interesting  and intriguing than the
standard mathematical shapes that often litter demos.

It has a sense of humour too - when  the bee hits the screen causing it to crack
is a notable comic moment. And apart from  the Senior Dads, most demos seem very
sombre in their tone when really demos should be about having fun.

The key to Sono's success is its  design.  I  would  argue that Sono is the best
Designed demo on the Falcon. Perhaps not  the best presented, not in its current
incarnation at least, but definitely the best designed.

The whole demo interlocks so perfectly with  the  music that it is like watching
MTV. (This is supposed to be a complement!  I could have said the Chart show but
that would certainly be taken as an  insult). The whole central section with the
bee and tree and flashing letters  which  is  synced  to  the beat works so well
because of this timing.

I'd heard the music on its own, and while  it is good it seems to sound about 10
times better when running with the demo.

One interesting thing about Sono  is  that  comparatively there aren't that many
effects, but you don't really notice this because of the fast inter-cutting. The
fast changing between effects adds an urgency and excitement to the demo as well
as creating its own rhythm. For example, if the  bee was on the screen in for 60
continuous seconds we would probably get bored of  it, but because it is only on
the screen for a bit then swapped away  our interest in it can be sustained over
a longer period.

Even effects which can be as dull as a tunnel have been spiced up. Sono's tunnel
employs a simple colour cycle effect, but this  adds to the dynamism of the demo
and sustains interest in the effect as it becomes almost mesmeric.

Sono is a great demo, and one that is  going  to be hard to beat. It is going to
take some real heavy coding of the DSP to surpass these effects.

But even if they can't beat the effects, demo coders should learn a lot from the
actual design  of  Sono.  Intercutting  of  effects,  tieing  everything  to the
rhythmic pulse of the  music,  changing  effects  dynamically  over time, adding
humour and creating original effects.

I just hope that we don't see  lots  of  clones  which flash their titles as big
letters on the screen!

Most demos talk a lot about "design" but  don't seem to really understand it. It
is not just about mushroom graphics or fading out each screen.

Design is giving the demo a  heart,  a  soul,  a  rhythmic beat that carries the
viewer through from start to end and leaves them with a smile on their face.
