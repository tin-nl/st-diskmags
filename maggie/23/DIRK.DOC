                       Approaching Year Seven..

It  does seem like ages ago when we first set out on the rocky path  of 
Diskzinedom,  and I'm sure we've laboured the nostalgia bit too much in 
previous issues already.. However, it doesn't seem like hardly any time 
at  all,  since the very significant fifth anniversary took place,  and 
now  it's  another couple of years on already..  Shows what you can  do 
with some good people to help out,  and a time accelerator..  Must dash 
and write on some other topics as I've got to get my finger out in time 
for the Year 2000 issue!!

Anyway, we now return you to your regular programming..


                        Of Mice and Nintendo..

In  contrast  to the PC dominated jibes conspicious  in  previous  Dirk 
based gibberings,  we take a little prod with our investigative fork at 
the console side of the salad plate for a while.. 

It is March, and everybody is aware of the big story of the month.. yes 
it's Nintendo 64 time, and boy, are we jubilant..

Well, the Edge magazine are jubilant, but they're paid agents and fifth 
columnists for Nintendo anyway,  so their opinion does not count..  One 
less  than pleased reaction comes in the form of a spoof press  release 
which announces that Nintendo are putting up their prices, when they're 
already  more  than a hundred pounds dearer than the  competition,  and 
that  they're  pleased  to  announce that  their  games  are  the  most 
expensive  in  the land..  Headscratching from the press soon turns  to 
finger  pointing at Sony who promptly say "We didn't do it,  we're  too 
'corporate'  (read  that  as  Boring)  to  behave  in  that  fashion.." 
Speculation  turns  to Sega,  who have had a rich previous  history  of 
merry japes and pranks of this nature,  but they shrug their collective 
shoulders in a gesture of denial too..

The most likely suspect for this outbreak of peevery at Nintendo, is an 
unknown independent retailer who was passed over/stiffed by the big 'N' 
when trying to get stock of the new console out of them.. 

Well that is all very well, but what do we think at Maggie GHQ..

Well  I  got to see the N64 in action at a local large  computer  games 
type chain store,  and can say that,  yes,  it's very nice.. The 3-D is 
less  buggy  than the Playstation,  and the design of 'Mario 64'  is  a 
geniunely  interactive  3-D environment,  nothing like the  fancy  mass 
polygon  chucking  linear and restrictive games that Sony  seem  to  go 
for..  If future releases are of this calibre,  then it looks like that 
N64 does have some sort of future..

However,  you have to remember it is Nintendo that are doing it..  (The 
BIG objection!)

There  were  only a couple of games I could see and Mario  was  one  of 
them..

It is 250 UKP, which is a bit expensive for a console..

You don't get a pack-in game either.. That is an extra 59.00 UKP..

Just  about everywhere else in the world will get it more cheaply  than 
we will.. Ho hum..

The games are also going to be very expensive as well..  Yes,  we're up 
against the restrictions of the cartridge format again..

The  UK  and European markets will only get the games six months  to  a 
year  later  than  everybody  else,  if previous form on  the  SNES  is 
anything to go by..

A  lot  of  the  games released in the USA and  Japan  won't  even  get 
released  here..  Again,  this  is taking the previous form on the SNES 
into  account..  Nintendo are a company who make piracy (Magic Drive et 
al) an attractive option with their extremely late and lame approach to 
the European market..

If  you really must have a console,  Sony have finally done the  decent 
thing,  and dropped the PlayStation price to 130 UKP,  Seventy UKP less 
than before.. Also some games to come down to 20 UKP as well..

I'm sure Sega are going to do something equally interesting before  too 
long a time has passed..

And  I'd  be very surprised if Nintendo didn't offer a  bit  more  than 
they're  currently offering by the time this issue of Maggie  hits  the 
streets..

Only time will tell how this story develops..

                         **The Monday After**

Computer Trade Weekly (CTW) splash their front page with NINTENDO  SELL 
OUT!' With only 20,000 units in the first batch of machines to come  to 
the UK, that is not too hard.. Even Atari would just about have managed 
that, er, maybe not!



Oh  well,  we can't leave this sort of thing alone for long I  suppose, 
Bill  G's  supporters  just love to bundle  ammunition  into  our  ever 
willing hands!!

             Bill Gates in Tight Shorts Shocker (pt 2)...

Last  time  in Dirk,  you might well remember the gushy letter  from  a 
woman  who  should have known better,  but for the prefrontal  lobotomy 
that got in the way of possible intelligent behaviour and said "Oi, you 
can't come in here,  you're barred!"..  Anyway, the stack of nauseating 
displays of misplaced affection for a certain rich American maufacturer 
of  arse flavoured products continues..  This one is mercifully shorter 
and sharper than Noreen Taylors effort..


"We  can  bet that Bill Gates will be remembered  five  centuries  from 
now...  If our civilisation is still flourishing in 2500, Gates will be 
considered one of the prominent figures in its development."

Francois Naudin (The European)


Err  right,  so that assumes that we will still care about the man five 
centuries  from  now..  Properly trained historians will get  a  proper 
perspective  on  Gates and all the other people who  actually  had  the 
ideas  that  he grabbed and exploited for his own gain..  The long  run 
view,  which  is  always the important one,  will probably put him in a 
historical niche as a brilliant corporate pirate, the Blackbeard of his 
time, rather than the Leonardo Da Vinci of the late 20th Century.. That 
is  me being extremely kind and restrained by the way,  a lot of  other 
people will just resort to groups of venomously spat four letter  words 
to sum up the man and his life's work.. 


               Flibinite Surpasser in New Field Trials..

Our local paper, dateline 5th March..

"Thai  House Body Massage - Special two girls massage with large  hydro 
bath and... er sorry, wrong page..

Let's start again..

"End   of  line P100 multimedia complete system with  œ500's  worth  of 
software,  just  œ699!"   (Name of company doing it deleted to  protect 
them from cashing in..)

Well  there you have it folks,  the Pentium P100 is officially obsolete 
now,  which  puts it in the computer graveyard with the 486sx's,  dx's, 
and  earlier  double  figure mhz Pentiums..  Do you think that  the  PC 
upgrade  rat-race is insaner than ever?  - Yes!!  Do you feel sorry for 
any of these fools? - No!

It  is interesting to see on the same page,  an advertisment that  goes 
"Cash paid for scrap!" - Not by the same company, I hasten to add!

(Well done to Felice for spotting that one..)

 
          Baghdad sees Internet as the end of Civilisation.. 

Here's   a  good  one  from  Silicon  Times  where  the  other   famous 
megalomaniac  of this decade,  Saddam Hussein seems to have Bill Gates' 
methods well and truly taped!  Maybe this article was commissioned in a 
fit of professional jealously by the mustachioed one.. CiH 

An editorial in the  Iraqi government newspaper  Al-Jumhuriya says that
the Internet  --  which is not accessible  in Iraq  --  is  "The end of
civilizations,  cultures,  interests,  and  ethics," and  "one  of  the
American  means to  enter every house in the world. They want to become
the  only source  for controlling human beings  in  the new  electronic 
village."  (AP 17 Feb 97)


                        Calling all PC Owners!

The art of emulation is about to take a whole new turn for the  better, 
as word reaches us of a brand new contender for the ST emulator  market 
on  the  PC..  The  new program has a French origin,  and claims to  be 
written  to  properly  emulate the hardware,  the  elusive  'total'  ST 
emulator,  in other words.. This program is called 'PacifiST' and comes 
recommended  by none other than Tony Greenwood,  who tells me that most 
games  and  diskmags will run on it,  even at this early  semi-complete 
stage in its life..  He even goes so far as to have STOS running on the 
emulator  environment  on his PC,  and does the majority of his  coding 
work there!!

Maggie  (the  ST  version,  of course) is one of those  that  will  run 
happily  under this pseudo Atari environment,  even with the  soundchip 
music  supported..  A  copy  is being obtained and we should  have  the 
chance  of a hands-on experience with the help of an obliging  ex-Atari 
PC person shortly!! 


                       Another bit of good news!

A little package turned up the other day,  what we had all been waiting 
for,  for months had arrived... Nemesis is here!! The day of reckoning, 
whe  I go to get it fitted is to hand (tomorrow),  and I am being extra 
careful with my back-ups, as there is this frisson of nervousness as if 
my Falcon is going to the dentist to have major bridgework done to it! 

More on what happens in the main Nemesis review to come in this issue..


                              Hallelluya!

This one is real and straight up.. Needs no further explanation..

Two  outstanding  opportunities  have arisen  for  individuals  of  the 
highest calibre to contribute  to the ongoing success of Microsoft, the 
world's leading business software organisation.

Technology  Evangelist  - In this key role you will  convert  potential 
customers into life-long Microsoft clients by evangelising the benefits 
of Microsoft's strategy and technology.

Advert in the Sunday Times..

Also  godsquad  demo  coders  Spirits  to  convert  their  prizewinning 
Symposium   4ktro  to  the  PC,   are  these  two  seemingly   separate 
announcements related?!


                        Pass the airgun Alice!

Our  overseas  correspondents  return from  a  particularly  successful 
Siliconvention  Party..  The atmosphere is great,  a fun time is had by 
all,  and  several  new demos are released..  It is happy days for  Tat 
particularly as he emerges as the winner in the main competition.. More 
of  that  in their convention report,  as we now turn to another  event 
that lingers in the Maggie Team memory, the Symposium Convention..

The follow up to last years party, Symposium part II or something is is 
incredibly  running at the same time as the Siliconvention party,  this 
time  in  a converted barn in Hannover,  done up to look like,  well,  a 
converted  barn  perhaps..  Atari people are thin on the ground to  the 
point of non-existence,  anyone with any sense immediately making their 
way  to the superior and more directly relevant event at  Bremen..  Not 
unexpectedly,  Symposium  is dominated by drunken Amiga owners  snoring 
their  heads off crashed out on sweat-sodden mattresses,  when  they're 
not semi-rioting and stealing other peoples food.. Several of these got 
thrown  out of the convention,  so no surprises there..  The PC owners, 
not wanting to feel left out, all rush the stage and bare their bottoms 
en-masse..

It's at times like these, you wish you were there..

With  a group of like-minded friends,  all armed with high-powered air-
rifles,  and  all equipped with decent telescopic sights to ensure that 
the pellets impact firmly in the area of the 'hogs eye!'


                           Senior Dads fly!

Just  when  you thought that the Air Dirt demo was a  clever  fake,  it 
turns out that parts of it are cleverer than even we suspected..

Now  you  might  think  the  'Poom'  clone,  running  in  glorious  3-D 
stereogrammic  vision,  is  just  a bundle of dots with  a  wonky  Abba 
sample, but you'd be wrong!

Although  not a 3-D texturemapped,phong-shaded 'Doom' dungeon,  you  do 
get  a  short  looped animation which consists of  the  legend  'Senior 
Dadzzz do it againnn!  which zooms in and out..  There may be some sort 
of  background as well,  but I couldn't really tell..  

There  are  two  ways  of seing the animation,  the  one  I  personally 
recommend  is to stand back eight or ten feet from the monitor  screen, 
and  squint really hard until the image starts to appear..  For  people 
who  really want to be sure,  their best bet is to get really close  to 
the  monitor,  and look at it from a forty-five degree angle,  going in 
from the left hand side..

Strictly one for Stereogram freaks, but an interesting 'hidden' part of 
the demo anyway.


                            Another Quote!

A  column  which has been sadly neglected for a while springs  back  to 
life with another gem from that unjustly disregarded palace of wit, the 
computer store..

So  once  again,  overheard  in  the sort of  place  that  sells  those 
glorified orange boxes with an 'Intel Inside' sticker on the case.. 

    "But if it's in stock, it's obsolete!"

And yes, it's a real quote..


     Some People We Discussed Earlier Reconsider Their Position..

Saddam  Hussein has decided something along the lines of "If you  can't 
beat 'em, join 'em!" As he sets up a website devoted to the man and his 
life  works..  The  usual sort of things,  pictures of Saddam as  Iraqi 
playmate of the month, a potted 'biography' etc, are all expected to be 
on there..

(Erm,  doesn't  the Iraqi version go more like "If you can't beat  'em, 
shoot 'em!"  - Just a thought, Ed)

This website can probably be found at;

 http//www:saddam.motherofallwebsites.dieamericanzionistentity.co.com

 (I've not finished yet!)

Oh  yes,  and in another megalomaniac news item this evening,  Nintendo 
have dropped their UK price for the N64 to 150 UKP!  (Which is the sort 
of money needed to get two games!)

Not a long time coming really, now we know for sure that console buyers 
are  divided into wealthy airheads,  and people who have a little  self 
discipline and can wait patiently for a bit.. 

The latter groups reward was not too long in coming this time..


                             And Finally!

Gary Kasparov is recovering from the sound drubbing that he received at 
the hands of IBM's 'Even Deeper Blue' ultimate pocket chess  computer.. 
(We are talking *giants* pockets here by the way!!)

However,  after studying the available evidence,  we at Maggie conclude 
that  no computer can ever replace a human chess grand master  for  the 
following sound and simple reasons..

1.  Most  Russian  grand  masters,  even  those ones  wearing  scratchy 
polyester clothing don't suffer from floating point error..

2.  No chess computer can kick its opponent under the table to distract 
it whilst it is contemplating a particularly difficult pawn gambit..

3. Chess computers don't tend to squeal like a stuck pig when they lose 
a match..

4. No chess computer has ever been a fully paid-up member of the KGB as 
far as we are aware..

5.  For  all  its 200 million possible move combinations,  'Even Deeper 
Blue' has nothing in its database about blaming everything and everyone 
but itself for throwing a whole tournament down the toilet..

6.  Chess  computers aren't prone to paranoid fantasies about  military 
intelligence members in the audience shining bright distracting  lights 
at them, or playing ultrasonic bat calls to put them off their game..

7.  No chess computer looks like Nigel Short...  This might be taken as 
an argument in FAVOUR..

8.  The computer has a much more mature and rounded personality, and is 
much nicer to talk to as well..

9.  The  computer was distracted into losing the first game because  it 
managed to get off with an attractive female member of the audience..

 That's iiiiit!!
