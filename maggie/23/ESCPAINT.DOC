I'm sure someone who can actually draw should be doing this review, 
but I suspect everyone has forgotten / doesn't have time to write 
about this art package from Germany. It's the brainchild of No of 
Escape, also responsible for this issue's 'Sili Con Carne' demo. 
Judging from the documentation this program has been in development 
for quite some time now, and looks to have had quite a lot of work 
put into it.

Good true-colour art packages on the Falcon aren't particularly rare: 
there is already the excellent but costly Apex Media, the cumbersome 
but powerful Rainbow 2 and the old standby Godpaint. These three all 
eschew a GEM-interface in favour of custom systems in order to 
squeeze the best performance out of the Falcon; on the ST the nearest 
neighbour would be NeoChrome or Deluxe Paint. Escape Paint favours 
the overall approach of Degas in that it has a mix of a GEM menu and 
window front end, plus a non-GEM set of tools on the actual drawing 
screens.

Booting it up for the first time is a little disconcerting, as 6 
windows slowly appear on the screen filled with options. Click the 
right mouse button and a nice logo appears - this is the drawing 
screen. Click again, and it's back to the options.

My first experience with this program was not great - I tried to move 
one of the windows and the program crashed. Hmmm... try again and 
this time there are no problems. However moving and configuring the 
windows with all the tools in is a bit fiddly at first, and I'd 
recommend running in a high resolution if possible so you can see all 
the options.

So first, let's check out all the tools... they all seem to work 
fine. Loading and saving... yep, seems to work... zoom modes? Crikey, 
thousands of them. Everything uses the curious mix of GEM and non-
GEM, but hangs together pretty well after a couple of hours.

I begin to wonder how to review a paint program without being able to 
draw. So instead of attempting to paint something, then going into 
all the features in use in any great depth, I'm just going to make 
some general observations.

Escape Paint appears to be a programmer's paint program in many ways. 
This is not just because there are lots of techy options ('Xor'
drawing modes for example!), but also because there is a lot of 
emphasis on drawing pixel-by-pixel rather than high-level picture 
manipulation.

In fact our very own Agent -t- uses Escape Paint because of the large 
number of zoom options. You can do the Degas-style zoom, a NeoChrome 
Zoom, realtime Zoom in the corners when doing normal painting, and so 
on and on... and on. It's a bit strange at first, but the longer you 
spend using the program, the more you realise that it's very well-
designed for the hardened painter.

One final very nice feature is the ability to code external modules 
that you can hook into Escape Paint to extend the range of basic 
features. On this version there is the module to use GemView picture 
loaders, which turns the program at a stroke into an excellent file 
converter for programmers.



                               Overall

So, a very nice 'little' program. It's still very much in development,
but already has lots of good features. You can write to the author at:
