Hiya CiH,
         Can't   say  that I've ever had the pleasure of   writting   to  
you  before,   until now that is.   You may or may not have heard of me,  
but I'm  writting for several reasons.  So erm,  hi,  I'm NEV of the now 
new 'Phat Ass Recordings'.

Reason   one  is  that  I have just purchased Maggie  22,   and  I  have  
to  congratulate you for that.   Fantastic issue.   The last time I read  
Maggie   was when TLB were on the case back in ye-olde  times(1990,   or 
was  is  1991,   I  can't remember),   but you and the crew seem to have 
done a wicked  job.  Well done.

The   second  reason  for writting is that I have written   an   article  
for  Maggie about the progression of demos in general(with huge emphasis 
on the  Atari machines(great)). Hope you like it and use it.

Third  reason  is that I want to put an advert in Maggie.   This  is  an 
advert  for a coder(68000 only).   I am a good Stos coder,  and can code 
some   very   simple 68000,   but I really need a half decent 68000  for 
what  I   need.   If  you yourself want to help me out then please  feel 
free to do so. Stos just  isn't up to the job.

Well   that's  really all I have to say apart from  congratulating   you  
once   more   for  the very polished Maggie 22(I havn't yet  seen  other  
issues  of  Maggie by your good self). 

Nuff Respect. Bigup yourself. L8-ER.

A Maggie Ed replies..

And whatever it takes to adequately express greetings back to you!

But seriously folks,  it is very nice to hear from someone who remembers 
back  to the olden days five or so years ago,  and remembers Maggie from 
that  far back as well..  With respect to back issues,  we took over the 
running  of  Maggie from issue 11,  sometime back in mid-1993,  and have 
kept it going since..  Feel free to ask, drop some disks in the post for 
the ones you are after..

The  article on demo coding will be used,  and I've added quite a bit to 
the  end  of it as well..  Some of the comments suggest reasons why  the 
demo scene has got the way it is, and may differ slightly from the views 
you were putting across.. (Nothing personal, so don't hit me!)
