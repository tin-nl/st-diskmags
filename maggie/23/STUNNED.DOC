     
 What  follows  is  an  appeal on behalf of the  Association  For  Abused  Disk 
 Magazines .....

 ST News ............ presumed dead,  then nursed back to health,  only  to  be 
                      cruelly pushed through 3.1 Windows (tm)
 Kelstar ............ Hideously  ridiculed in a well-known  national  magazine, 
                      which  brought  it to everyone's attention,  only  to  be 
                      viewed as something of freak value then consigned to  the 
                      back of everyone's thoughts again
 ST Highway ......... neglected because its owner didn't have the time to  look 
                      after  it properly,  then given away to a  colleague  who 
                      didn't  understand what was required for a  healthy  disk 
                      magazine

 ..... don't let their deaths be in vain. There's still a chance to make up for 
 what  happened to these poor defenceless diskmags,  and YOU can make  all  the 
 difference.  Here at our Darlington headquarters we would like YOU to adopt  a 
 new-born baby diskmag,  and give it a good home. We're not asking for charity, 
 we're not after your money (although all donations are welcome!).  All we want 
 from you in return is an article,  or more if you can spare them,  so that our 
 little dismag can lead a long, happy and fulfilled life.

 So  please donate your articles generously,  and sleep safe in  the  knowledge 
 that you have given a new diskmag a good home and a chance at life.

 The first diskmag will be available on May 1st 1997,  and further ones will be 
 ready for re-homing on the first of every second month.

 To receive YOUR diskmag,  send an article on a DD disk,  along with a  stamped 
 self-addressed envelope to:

 STUNNED Diskzine
 c/o John Thompson
 30 East Raby Street
 Darlington

 Thank you for your support
