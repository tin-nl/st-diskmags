                A new ST Maggie Shell: Planned design

One of the great 'selling' points of Maggie as a disk magazine has 
always been the shell system it used. The Delta Force shell was 
released in 1990 and was (at the time) a great leap forward compared 
to the other shells around. Smooth scrolling, varied text, a 
colourful cover picture screen and some great music made it one of 
the all-time favourite shell systems on the ST.

However, although it has stood the test of time well, I think it has 
become a bit dated over the years. In the age of HTML and web-
magazines, the text engine looks a bit tired, and even other disk 
magazines on the Amiga and PC (spit) have brought in new features. In 
addition, not every Atari user wants to use the standard TOS any 
more: indeed there is a growing user base who use ST emulators. This 
includes certain STOS game writers, I hear. Allegedly.

As a result, I am planning to remake the Maggie shell, using as much 
of the (reliable) original code as possible, to drag it kicking and 
screaming towards the 21st century. This article is intended as an 
outline overall design of what I have planned at the moment.

So, we want your suggestions! Recently we had a couple of people who 
complained that they wanted to read the articles from the GEM 
desktop, or had problems with the interface. Therefore I want to 
address some of these points in a revised magazine design. But if 
there’s anything else you want to get off your chest, write to me. 
There are still lots of little bits of the ST shell that I personally 
find really annoying, so I'm sure there must be something.

I especially want to hear from people who use non-TOS Ataris, so we 
can sort out how to cater for you. This section of the readership 
appears to be growing..



                          1. Overall Design

As usual at the ever-caring Maggie, the first consideration in the 
design of the ST shell is 'who is going to use the ST shell?' The 
answer to this is basically "people who can't use Mr. Pink's Falcon 
shell" which falls into 3 categories:

1. People still with STs
2. People with non-TOS/ non-standard Falcons
3. People running ST emulators

In trying to strike a balance between the three, I propose:

- A standard ST shell (possibly with extra features for expanded 
Ataris) This should be quick and responsive even on 520STFMs.

- Some (GEM-based?) utilities that allow the articles and pictures to 
be used by people who can't get the shell working

Most of the work will have to be done in the shell itself: it will 
still have to be *both* colour and mono compatible for normal STs. 
This limits quite severely what we can do with the design, but still 
leaves a fair amount of room for alteration.

One other consideration is the storage of the data and articles on 
disk. Until this issue, all the files were stored individually. This 
wasted a lot of disk space, so now (as of issue 23) we have 
introduced one large linkfile, saving an average of 20-30K of disk 
space each issue. However, this causes problems for people who can't 
use the shell at all. Part 4 will address this in a bit more detail.




                         2. Front End Design

Some revamping of the front end was done a few months ago (issue 21 
onwards) and I don't propose to alter it much. I still like the idea 
of the 'issue-defining cover pic' as CiH calls it, so the shell shall 
stay in its present two-part form.

However some tweaks should be brought in, eg.

? Keyboard control of all features,
? A possible 'extract' of the contents of the highlighted article 
appearing at the bottom of the screen,
? A different screen fade effect (at last!),
? Possible a slight alteration of the graphics to reflect the new 
design more,
? New article-loading routines.


                        3. Text Viewer Design

Of all the parts of the shell, this is the one that needs revamping 
the most. Those shades of blue are very nice, but 7 years is long 
enough!

So what needs changing?

- Text area. The text displayer is very fast, but in my opinion too 
much of the screen is taken up by the border, meaning that the 
text itself often looks a bit cluttered. I propose changing the 
visible text area to 72 x 25 characters (ie. 576 x 200 in medium 
resolution) which lets you see more on each page and changes the 
screen format to give more of a newspaper-style layout. This is a 
lot easier to read, so less eyestrain after reading your fave mag 
(?) for hours.. The left column of the screen would be used for an 
issue-defining logo and some of the controls.

- Revised text-handling. The First-Word-Plus file format will be 
retained because it is still reasonably standard on the Atari and 
includes some good text-handling features. However, Headings and 
Subheadings should be added (using the Superscript/Subscript 
styles?) In addition, there should definitely be a picture-in-text 
option because this allows both a breakup of the text, and lets me 
include pictures in the programming articles. The format of the 
in-text images will be medium resolution IMG files, like 1st Word 
Plus already handles.

- Text Sectioning and Movement. One thing that always annoys me 
about most text displayers is moving around the text area by 
pages. Maggie is better than many in that it scrolls by line 
rather than page, but surely it would be better to include an 
(invisible) special character to denote the start of a logical 
section of the text? Then using the left and right cursors would 
move to the previous/next section. Or would this annoy you?

- Controls. Keyboard controls would be revised (eg. Using 
shift+cursors instead of control+cursors to move a page up/down) 
The buttons/icons for controlling movement would be all in the 
left-hand panel of the screen, only appearing when you (a) pressed 
a certain key or (b) moved the mouse to the left hand side of the 
screen. 'Dragging' of the text area would result in the text 
scrolling etc. More details than this have yet to be finalised.






                          4. Other Utilities

This is intended for those who prefer GEM/ non-TOS readers. By 
providing some sort of utility so you can get at the files, you can 
easily read the articles by using 1st Word or 1st Word Plus, avoiding 
the need to write a GEM-based displayer!

The sort of utility I have in mind is a GEMDOS system patch, so that 
by selecting the data linkfile, all the files in the linkfile (apart 
from the hidden articles!) appear transparent to the system you are 
working on. The other alternative is to unpack all the files in the 
linkfile and save them to a target destination (not exactly suitable 
for floppy drive systems, but they will probably use the ST shell)

In case some people don't have a version of First Word, then we could 
also do a little converter to make ASCII files. The final utility 
would be to display the articles' low-resolution pictures as used in 
the current ST shell in some kind of GEM format.

If anyone comes up with an alternative to this then please let me 
know.


                            5. Conclusion

OK, that's all the suggestions I have to make. Any other views will 
be welcomed. And if you don't have your say, I can't cater for your 
views..
