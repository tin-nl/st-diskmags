         Another nice intro graphic on the demo text by the way!

This is probably one of the most challenging demos to review that we've 
ever  come  across..  I  phoned Leon the other day to see  how  he  was 
getting on, and he asked me if I had reviewed this demo yet.. "No, were 
you  planning to do it yourself?" I said..  Some unrepeatable  comments 
were  passed back and the request was made that he would like to  pass 
on this one,  thank you very much,  as trying to describe this was next 
to  impossible,  our ace reviewer and hardened coder having an aversion 
to  effects  made  up of swirly patterns of light..  Now it  is  up  to 
muggins to sort out..

I'm  not  totally alone here,  as I've got Tat's  'Tech-View'  comments 
tagged  on  the  end  of this review,  so at least I  know  that  table 
manipulation was involved,  although if the members of Escape did start 
moving  furniture  around,  none  of this was allowed to get  into  the 
finished demo!

The first bit is easy enough to describe, a smart high-resolution title 
sequence  with a pencil-drawn style 'Escape' logo and title that  fades 
in  and  out smartly..  The music,  having kicked in,  is also suitably 
swirly in feel, as if to reflect the main theme of this demo..

The first effect is a '90's version of that classic staple of ST demos, 
the  sineous  dots..  there  are a lot of them,  and they are  suitably 
swirly.. Then the first suggestion that a Falcon is really taking part, 
with  what  can best be described as a sunburst effect,  distorted  and 
moved around the screen on invisible bumpmaps..

After  but a short time,  we get a full screen worth of classic  plasma 
which  also  has echoes,  like the sineous dots, of the old school..  A 
small  number  of  bobs are formed into a baton shape  and  attack  the 
screen  in  tempo  with the more aggressive tone of the  music,  for  a 
refreshing change in pace..

The  first  impossible to describe adequately swirly thing puts  in  an 
appearance, followed by a warping vector line object, that looks like a 
spider  corpse (looks and moves better than this  description  implies, 
actually!)

Another of those table manipulation effects, or 'swirly things' arrives 
onscreen.  This is more blocky in feel,  and has elements of the plasma 
screen  seen earlier..  The third one is best left to fend for  itself, 
but is very fullscreen indeed,  and you can get a reasonable version of 
the same effect if you stand very near a plughole draining a bathful of 
grey and murky water..

The  dots  make a comback,  in a wavelike formation,  and then the gold 
warped  sunburst  seen at the start decides to come back for  a  little 
while  as well..  We are on the final lap,  as the final piece of table 
manipulation,  a  slightly  more tunnel-like effect takes  place..  The 
endscreen  is a nice touch as it is a Calamus screengrab with  the  end 
credits on them..

TECH VIEW by Tat:  In my opinion this was the most underrated of the 
demos released at the Siliconvention. The design is very understated 
(although a  bit  rough  around the edges)  and although most of the 
effects are table  manipulation and dot/line effects,  they are very 
well designed.  One slight tech glitch is in the vertically-mirrored 
effects,  where there's a bit of  flickering  (perhaps due to raster 
interrupt problems?) Apart from that, a nice cool demo. A redesigned
version is promised... yes please (tat)

Ratings..

Graphics:- 80% - Not a lot of hand-drawn stuff,  but nicely manipulated 
effects made up for that..

Sonix:- 85% - A very suitable tune for the demo,  effects well keyed in 
to the changes in soundtrack..

Gee-Whiz:- 85% - Some oldish things,  but some things never really seen 
before as well..

Overall:- 83% - A worthy debut effort (I think this was their first big 
demo?)
