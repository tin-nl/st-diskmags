First Sight: RIPLEY
-------------------

As the title indicates,  this  game  is  one  of those horrible things
created simply to  exploit  the  success  of  a  film.   Games such as
Moonwalker,  Robocop  and  the  entire   Rambo  trilogy,  in  all  its
appallingness, spring to mind.  But,  before  I  put you off for life,
Bill & Ted's is not as bad  as  any  of those, well maybe not quite as
bad...
     If you remember Bill & Ted's,  the  film  (yes, I confess, I have
actually watched enough of it,  to  have  painful memories relating to
why I spent œ2.50 to go and  see  it),  you will recall words such as:
"Bogus", "Triumphant" and of course:  "Excellent".   Bill & Ted's, the
game includes all such distortions of mentally sound people's English,
but they are so infectious, that after  you have been playing it for a
few minutes, you will find that  you  have become an indigenous member
of 'Dude!-land' and can  only  say:  "Be  most  triumphant, dude!", or
"Most heinously bogus, dude!".
     So, on to the gameplay.. in single player mode you control either
Bill or Ted, the character you don't choose stays behind to 'Guard the
Phone Booth' (no, I'm not making  this  up).  In two player mode, your
partner in Excellence, controls  the  second  guy  (the one you didn't
choose because he looked  like  a  demented,  60's  hippy reject).  In
single or two player mode,  the  object  of  the  game is the same: to
rescue the babes Joanna and Elizabeth from the heinous clutches of the
grim reaper.  Roughly translated: find your girlfriends.  And in order
to do this, you must fly through time  and space in a phone box (now I
wonder where they got that idea from),  picking up the trails of music
notes left by  your  girlfriends  and  clues  you  left  yourself in a
different time zone (so you also  have  to plant the clues to yourself
or you won't be able to  find  them  in the future or something).  The
game is an overhead/forced  perspective  view,  similar to Gauntlet 2,
but I'm afraid that's where any  similarity  with that classic game is
abruptly, brutally, but necessarily severed.
     The most part of  the  gameplay  is  taken  up by puzzle solving,
there are mazes to be  negotiated,  objects  to locate, paths to find,
the usual, standard adventure  game  fare.   The puzzles are solvable,
but tend towards being hard;  just  as  you  think you have found that
crucial object, a  new  difficulty  is  thrown  up  to  divert you for
another half an hour and  this  can  get  annoying  all too soon.  The
arcade element of  the  game  comes  in  the  form  of avoiding Scarab
beetles which home in on you as  you innocently try to collect all the
requisite amount of notes for that  time  zone,  as well as weird wild
animals that  attempt to eat you  en  masse, such as Lion's which look
more like scarecrows.  If you are  eaten  (which is more than likely),
you are transported back to the phone  booth, or a re-start point, and
simply continue the game where you left off (or turn it off and donate
the carte de jeu to  the  Evergreen's  jumble sale).  You don't really
have a certain amount of lives,  but  if  you spend too long in Egypt,
the beetles will breed and  every  time  you  put  your toe out of the
booth, they will 'Bogus!' you.
     In single player mode you start  the  game  with a guitar and the
in-game music will twang  away  accordingly,  but  if you find another
instrument such as a harp, or  a  flute,  the music will play the same
tune in this new instrument.  A nice touch, but since you get bored of
the tune  after  approximately  0.001462  milliseconds  anyway,  there
doesn't seem much point.
     You begin the Excellent adventure in  Egypt  at 1700 BC, but once
you have collected enough music  notes  or  found  a page of the phone
book (so you can dial your destination), you will be able to travel to
other places, such as Rome... and.. erm,  I have to confess, that  was
the extent of my travels.
     The graphics, while being  cartoony,  are  not the greatest, they
remind me of Chip's Challenges and on  a good day, could charitably be
called functional.  The music, as I have said, is okay-ish but because
it is so short, you've soon heard  it  twice too often and are hitting
option 2 for relief.
     One of the worst  aspects  of  the  game  is  the sluggish, jerky
progress of your sprite across the  screen  and while you can increase
the pace by holding down button B  as  you walk, the increased pace is
still not up to much and you have  the added risk of blundering into a
beetle breeding-ground  unprepared.   Another  annoying  burr  in  the
primitive fur  of this game (henceforth, metaphor allowance restricted
to one per six thousand words -Ed), is the intel speed with which your
character responds to the controls (although  this could be the coders
trying to recreate the full effect  of  watching too many Keanu Reeves
films), which instills a sense of frustration in players used to games
such as Doubl- (Snip! -Ed).
     In its favour, B & T's  does  have  a password system, similar to
the one in Slime world, so that you  can resume your game at any point
and with any objects you have found  and tasks you have completed etc.
This should add to the longevity of the game, but long periods of time
spent trying to avoid  beetles  and  failing  miserably,  can have the
opposite effect.

     In essence, if you've had  a  life-long  ambition to sport a crap
hair-do, a boyish grin and  an  annoying  habit of including 'Dude' in
the only five sentences you are capable of warbling, then this game IS
for you.  Similarly if you like taxing, annoying, repetitive adventure
games, then this game is  also  for  you, but otherwise, I'd certainly
NOT be adventurous, and try B4U buy..



Second Sight: Mr. Pink
----------------------

So we  examine  that  much  derided  beast  "The  Film  Licence Game".
Although sales to domestic  homes  are  good,  owners  quickly tire of
their banality and they are often  given  away or chucked out into the
streets. But remember kids,  a  film  licence  is  for  life, not just
Christmas!

And who can imagine a worse fate than having to spend the rest of your
life with Bill and Ted and their  inanities and strings of "jokes". In
creating films like B&T and  Forrest  Gump, American movie makers were
trying to say -  its  cool  to  be  thick.  Which  is  bollocks. But I
digress.

The game begins with some cartoony graphics  of Bill and Ted that bear
absolutely no resemblance to the actors that played their parts in the
film. There then follows and astounding two frame animation where they
slap their hands together. You almost wonder why they bothered.

As you start the game you  can  choose  to  be either Bill (The Thick,
Ugly one with blond hair) or Ted  (The Thick ugly one with dark hair).
Some choice. As neither of them  having any special skills (apart from
an immense ability to act stupidly)  this  choice has little effect on
the rest of the game.

There is a rather  nice  sequence  as  the  phone  box whizzes through
hyperspace - even though this only  appears  to  be a colour cycle, it
works quite well.

You land in Egypt.  At  least  it  is  supposed  to  be Egypt, but the
graphics are so bad you can't really tell. As you start to explore you
notice how slowly that you move. You  can 'run' by holding down button
B, but this more reminiscent of  a arthritic pensioner ambling towards
the post-office  than  Linford  Christie.  Trying  to  move diagonally
through moves whilst running and avoiding beetles is a real headache.

Did I mention beetles? If you play  this  game you will become a rapid
beetle-phobe as they have the habit  of  killing you off. If you spend
too long on a level, all  the  beetles  will start homing into you and
kill you off immediately as you restart the game.

I'm afraid I couldn't see the attraction  in this game. It is supposed
to be an arcade adventure  game,  but  its  poor graphics and sluggish
speed really put you off. Its as dull as its heroes.



The Verdict:       Bill &  Ted's Excellent Adventure
