   Miscelleneous pixel-crunching morsels chewed over and spat out..

It  looks  like  some  long running stories are  about  to  come  to  a 
climactic finish at last..

Now,  many of these will no doubt be covered elsewhere in this issue of 
Maggie,  and  more  thoroughly than is possible with this article of  a  
'taster' nature..

Anyway, here goes..

'Running'  - The Doom clone covered in preview form in issue 20..  This 
is  due for a final release at Siliconvention in two weeks from now  at 
time  of writing this article..  Running will be shareware,  at a price 
equivalent to 15 to 20 UKP.. This looks like extraordinarily good value 
for a game where so much obvious effort has been put in, and looks like 
resolving  the  too  long outstanding decent 'Doom' clone  gap  on  the 
Falcon..  Subject  to things actually going to plan,  there should be a 
full review in this issue of Maggie..

'Painium  Disaster'  -  A vertically  scrolling  shootemup  written  by 
Cruor..  A  game  very much in the mould of 'Wings of Death',  Xenon 2, 
etc..  This is also due for release at the Siliconvention, and again as 
a  shareware or commercial release..  As with Running,  we will have to 
see if it does succeed in making it out..

'3D  Crown  of Creation' - Not part of the  anticipated  Siliconvention 
cycle  of happenings,  and one of the most misleading game titles  ever 
invented..  You  think  it refers to some kind of fantasy adventure  or 
roleplaying  game,  but  instead,  it  is a promising 'Elite' or  'Wing 
Commander'  type  space game on the Falcon..  Work started on  this  as 
early  as  1994,  and  a preview mainly showcasing a very  slick  title 
sequence was released..  The main game engine was showing some depth or 
lightsource  shaded  3-D space ships and had a very  basic  interface.. 
This seemed to go away,  and we thought it had sunk without trace,  but 
there are reports that there is a new preview, and the game may well be 
ready shortly.. More on this story as soon as we get it!

'Republic'  -  This is now the new name for the  forthcoming  Reservoir 
Gods next major game. formerly known as 'Spyhunt'.. The plot is thought 
to  have  expanded somewhat from the 'drive around  and  shoot  things' 
premise  of the original game..  A very provisional release date is for 
the end of April, possibly at the Birmingham Atari Show..

'Donkey  Island'  - A 'bare bones' preview has now been released  to  a 
waiting  world..  We will be covering this more thoroughly with a  full 
preview  of  a more advanced version..  Release is likely to be at  the 
Birmingham Atari Show at the end of April.. The author is thought to be 
working  on ways of making it as compatible with as many  different  ST 
type computers, clones and emulators as possible.. (Release date is now 
considered to be a tad optimistic,  we'll let you know as soon as it is 
ready, okay!)

Now  enough of these excitingly impending developments,  and on to  the 
more  familiar  slightly  further  away sort of  news  this  column  is 
designed to handle..

Pieter  van  der Meer,  author of Neurobotix,  is working on an 'Elite' 
type space game called 'Solos'..  This will be Falcon specific,  and is 
receiving his top priority..  Suggestions from interested parties as to 
what  form the game should take are welcomed..  (See the interview text 
this issue for more details..)

Colin  Polonowski of Croft Soft is thought to have purchased a  Falcon, 
and may well be coding Falcon specific versions of his games?

A strange little preview arrived on my hard drive the other day..  This 
was  called  'Apollo  13',  or Apollo 1.3',  and seems to be of  French 
origin..  How do we know this when it came with no readme text, and not 
even a single scrap of other text? Well, after quitting out, and trying 
to get back in,  we get an error message in French that says the DSP is 
tied  up  on another application..  However,  this is a fly over a  3-D 
fractal mountainscape,  but one that is both tastefully texture-mapped, 
and also depth shaded as well..  This relies on the Jaguar joypad to do 
the moving around part of the business.. More info, and quickly please!

Tony  Greenwood  has  been busy again,  his latest venture  is  another 
platformer,  called 'Billy Boy',  this time with more of a 'Mario twist 
to  it..  Following on from that,  quite possibly the ultimate test for 
STOS and its related extensions as he contemplates an ST version of the 
Jaguar classic 'Tempest 2000'!

Marcus  Binders  epic  'Star  Raider',   formerly  known  as  'Cosmic', 
previewed  just a couple of issues ago,  has apparently expanded to the 
chairbloating heights of twenty-seven floppy disks! Sounds like one for 
CD ROM only!

*Weirdest Rumour of the lot!*
Douglas  Little has apparently got hold of the source code for  'Quake' 
and  is thinking of converting it to computers Atari related..  Such  a 
game,  if  this  were  the case,  is likely to need an  Afterburner  or 
similar  calibre  accelerator board!  Following that up,  Amiga  Format 
advise  of  a  port of 'Quake' to the Amiga,  this time an  '060  based 
machine,  and  again,  an  unauthorised movement of source code from ID 
Software seems to be the Key!! Fascinating!!

*Another good one!*
The  source code for 'Killthings' the promising 'Doom clone for the  ST 
previewed  a  little  while back,  has been released  into  the  public 
domain..  Mark Lewis has given up his ST,  but it is hoped that someone 
else out there will take the project on..

Here's the lowdown..

Hi Richard,

Thought  I'd drop you a line regarding  Killing Things (doom clone for
ALL Atari's).

The game was started by Jon Lewis,  it  was reviewed in the last issue
of Maggie.Well I occasionally e-mail Jon but he stopped mailing me. By 
coincidence I was chatting to a contact (Mark from Adrenalin) who said
Jon had phoned him.

To cut a  long story short,  Jon  now  has no Atari and has moved to a 
new job writing games for a company in Lancaster.He has put the source
to KT in the PD arena for someone else to continue.

He  said  he  wouldn't mind you  putting a note into the next issue of 
Maggie to let people know what was happening.

Take it away mate!

     H.E.R.O.2 is currently work in progress,  the game  has  been 
tested and now working succesfully on  falcon tos 404 and tos 402, 
sound has been configured for optimum playback on both STe and the 
Falcon,  new  artwork  and levels are being worked  on,  the  game 
engine is being tweaked, new animations are being added as well as 
a massive sound enhancement

      The  finished H.E.R.O.2 Will require a minimum 4meg  STe  or 
Falcon to run,  and should be ready By Summer 97... so not long to 
go, If you have internet access then you can check out the current 
status of the game and read the H.E.R.O.  Diary on the web page at 
the top of this Document

     I thank you in advance for your Support ....Cheers..!ynoT

Hmmm,  he might be interested in some of the comments in the Eddies Cat 
interview  about  the original game..  Might help with  the  'tweaking' 
aspect??

Also 'Billy Boy' is out, review to follow shortly..
