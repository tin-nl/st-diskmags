MOVIE REVIEWS

As ever,  I have been seeing a fair amount of movies.  One or two 
have  been reviewed before as seen in the cinema by  CiH,  but  I 
have  also  seen a couple of Oscar-winning movies at  the  cinema 
recently.

It is a change for this column to feature Oscar winning movies  - 
in  recent  years  these have been for movies  that  are  usually 
considered  as  'pap'  but,   this  time  round,  there  is  some 
incredibly good stuff about.


EVITA

This musical movie stars Madonna and Antonio Banderas, along with 
England's very own Jimmy 'Crocodile Shoes / Spender'  Nail.  Yes, 
Jimmy Nail has one of the first major singing roles in the  movie 
(which  he  handles extremely well) and there is not  much  of  a 
trace of his Geordie roots, which came out in Crocodile Shoes.

I'm not quite sure of the history of the movie,  however, Madonna 
stars in the main role of Evita,  a former Queen of Argentina who 
wins the hearts of the people. There is no spoken dialogue at all 
-  the whole movie just consists of singing,  but there are  some 
great songs to be seen and heard by the members of the cast.

The  movie ends quite sadly,  with the death of  Evita,  and  the 
funeral scenes are certainly moving. The sets are very well done, 
with nice decoration etc,  and as for the acting / singing, it is 
up to a very high standard.

If you didn't get to see Evita at the flicks,  why not give it  a 
go when it comes out on video shortly ? (I think the NTSC version 
is out already). I don't think it is a movie you will regret.

Rating:- 85%


THE ENGLISH PATIENT

Starring  a  whole  cast of mostly  unknowns  to  anyone  outside 
England,  The English Patient is a movie about a dying man who is 
placed  on  a bed,  remembering the days of World War 2  and  the 
fighting in the deserts against the Germans at that time.

The  main star in this movie is Ralph Fiennes,  who rose to  fame 
with  his portrayal of the Nazi,  Hermann Goeth,  in 'Schindler's 
List'.  The  new  role,  however,  sees  him playing a dying man, 
with  his  fond memories of battles and other  events  that  took 
place in the deserts of Africa during World War 2.

Alongside Fiennes are a host of other British stars, most of whom 
had only previously been seen in British TV shows.

The  movie is generally a little on the slow side at times,  with 
some  of the dialogue being slightly unintelligible,  but it  did 
win a well-won Oscar for the art & picture direction,  along with 
another oscar for Fiennes.

Generally  a  pretty  good movie for those who  are  into  seeing 
dramas based around this particular part of the war.


EDDIE

This movie, starring Whoopi Goldberg (Sister Act) as a basketball 
coach  who successfully coaches a New York team called 'New  York 
Knicks'.  It  is generally very amusing in a lot of places,  even 
though  most of the supporting cast were unknowns it did feel  as 
though  they  had great potential.  One,  in particular,  played a 
Russian  player,  and  looked like a relative of  Dolph  Lundgren 
(Rocky IV etc) - he came over real funny.

Rated  12  for  content,  the  movie  is a  good  comedy  and  is 
definitely  well worth seeing,  despite the fact that the cliches 
in  it  have been seen in countless other movies  of  this  genre 
before.


LIAR LIAR

This  movie,  starring  the  excellent comedy actor,  Jim  Carrey 
(previously known for his roles in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and 
The  Cable Guy) in one hell of a comedy that featured  plenty  of 
new style jokes for potentially hilarious situations.

Carrey  stars as the father of a young son who,  upon the wish of 
said son,  is not allowed to lie for a total of 24 hours - ie,  a 
full  day.  Being  a lawyer,  Carrey did realise himself that  he 
could tell 'little white lies' in court and not be found out  ... 
but now he couldn't tell any lies at all !! :-)

The  result  is that he must tell the truth - and  this  is  real 
hilarious,  as  he ends up saying to a rather full-chested  young 
woman  in  a  lift the fact that 'she has big  boobs  etc'  which 
promptly earned him a slap from the woman concerned !!

There were a lot of funny situations, such as a classic one where 
he admits to everyone on leaving a lift that he has let off ...
ie  something that men in particular have probably been known  to 
do  in those sort of places (We only need ask Jeremy  Beadle  and 
Gordon Storey to see this happening in practice !).

The  movie rolls on with various situations,  but there are  some 
serious  moments,  when  Jim learns that his ex-wife (who  he  is 
still  on  speaking terms with) was moving to Boston with  a  new 
boyfriend. However, things end up being fine in the end.

Both Jane and I enjoyed the movie .... we laughed a lot during it 
and will hopefully see more movies now at the cinema,  which will 
be nice.

Who is Jane ? .........  well, you'll have to wait and see ....


Felice.
