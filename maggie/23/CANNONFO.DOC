It's not official,  it's definitely not cricket, but it is the return of 
those little antlike guys with the guns, Lemmings with attitude!

Not surprisingly, Sensible Software have not sponsored this production, 
treating the ST and related hardware like something maggot-ridden  that 
is  the starring corpse in one of the more explicit 'leave  nothing  to 
the imagination' school of murder-mysteries.. 

Instead, we have the loving hands of (insert details here) to thank for 
bringing  this preview to our machine..  This works on both the STe and 
Falcon,  and  rather  better  on the latter machine,  as  I'll  explain 
shortly..  (There  is  a more advanced version of Cannon Fodder by  the 
way,  this  is  available  on the Jaguar,  is well up to the  mark  for 
presentation,  but suffers from lack of a satisfactory substitute for a 
mouse pointer!) 

There is some speculation that it is not perhaps a faithful copy of the 
version  on other machines..  There seems to have been some adaption of 
some  of  the  graphics from the original game,  and  these  have  been 
grafted  onto  the  levels of the second  game..  The  soundchip  music 
certainly is a relic from the original game..

It  is possible that the game code has been ported over from the  Amiga 
version,  as  the performance of the screen scrolling is variable,  and 
seems  to be missing certain hardware?  It is just about tolerable,  if 
not brilliant on the Falcon, and awful on the STe on some of the bigger 
levels..  It  seems that this revamp has yet to get round to refreshing 
those parts..

On the plus side, it is as playable as the original, with a handy range 
of  weapons  and nasties to tackle,  and a series of missions,  even in 
this preview to keep you busy..  For Falcon owners, there is no fiddle-
faddle with 'Backward' or other ST compatibiliy fixes to get it  going, 
and the dubious reassurance of some kind of scroll movement that  keeps 
up with the game..

When the full and finished thing will be released,  is not clear,  this 
preview has apparently been doing the rounds for some time before  now, 
and it is debatable when or even if the final game will appear.. 

Still,  if  the scrolling problems that plague running it on an STe are 
resolved, this will be a good one to check out when it is done..
