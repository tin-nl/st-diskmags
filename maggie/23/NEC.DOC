                            NEC Multisync 3D


                            By John Hayward



The NEC Multisync 3D is a stylish,  quality Japanese made  14"  monitor 
which can do colour and mono modes  off the  ST with a  small interface 
cable.   It is really nicely styled and perches nicely on the Megas and 
Teeties quite nicely.  There  are some  digital  controls under a front 
flap,I didn't have a manual but I managed to fiddle about with them and
it works fine anyway. It looks really nicely styled, looking clean from
the front and nicely curved along on the top and the back.

The model 3D  I have got, is probably a bit old now as it can't do SVGA
so PC owners are likely to sell them fairly cheaply. Since the 3D,  NEC
have also brought out the series 4 and 5,  and  the  latest  models are 
called the  M series.  The  Swiss built  turbo-nutter 040 powered Atari 
clone, the Medusa, is actually used with one of the new NEC multisync M
series monitor which has rather strange styling.

NEC invented the  first  multisync to  solve the problems of computers 
with different frequencies and screen resolutions,although the original
model could not do VGA, and I don't know if it will work on an Atari.

What is a multisync? 

I don't know all the techy ins and outs of them.  A multisync has some 
intelligent  circuitry  to  suss  out  the  frequency  and  amount  of 
resolution needed by the host computer attached to it.


Overall I am very pleased with my NEC, they are shocking good value as 
I only paid œ52 for mine INCLUDING VAT & postage!   Your average Atari 
SM124 costs at least œ80 second hand  as an awful lot of STs are being 
snapped  up for  music studios,  hi-res  monitors  seem to be in short 
supply.  It  certainly  knocks  spots  off any of the Atari or Philips 
units. As it is primarily a VGA monitor, I can use it with some of the
old PCs I have knocking about that I repair and sell,  although I have
a cheap and nasty  clone type  VGA  monitor  which I normallly use for 
this, and I would also like to get a  graphics card  for  my  Mega/STE 
which will need a true VGA monitor.


A few drawbacks include there being  no  sound as the unit is designed 
for a PC,  and when using hi res the icons appear to have a very faint
ghost to right,although the picture quality is very good. I had to pay
œ25 for an adapter cable for my ST,  from Titan designs which they had
to order from somebody else.  The adapter cable had a black box with a
dodgy  looking  metal toggle  switch and a single phono port for sound 
(for STFM users who don't have any audio ports.)  and two cables,  one 
with a 15 pin VGA plug,  and the other with an  Atari 13 pin video DIN 
port, it looks rather clunky but it works.


Good points
-----------

NEC have a good reputation for sound build quality and reliabilty

Perfectly suited to the ST and the Falcon

Nice styling 

Has tilt and swivel stand

Terrific bargain for the serious ST enthuiast


Bad points
----------

No built in sound (The NEC multisync M does though)

Now superceded

ST switcher box is expensive and rather crude

Very minor amount of ghosting when using hi res modes

Mine has a tiny bit of screen burn and a slight chip in the case



The NEC Multisync 3D costs œ40, or œ52 including VAT and postage from
Axis Disposals,  who once advertised I don't their  phone  number  or 
address,  if you are interested in getting one,  write to me and I'll
find it for you.
