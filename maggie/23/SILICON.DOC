                               ------------------

        A LOOSE PATCHWORK OF RECOLLECTIONS BY MR. PINK OF RESERVOIR GODS


"STOP THE MUSIC AND GO HOME. I REPEAT, STOP THE MUSIC AND GO HOME." The voice of
the official blares out  of  the  megaphone  causing  anguished squeals from the
crowd. The forces of authority sure know how to wreck a party.
I reach for my CD player and eject the Daft Punk album filing it carefully away.
Awaiting me calmly on my bedroom floor is  a bulging bag full of disks, clothes,
a sleeping bag and most importantly my Falcon.

It is Tuesday some three days before the  party  is due to begin, but because of
the bizarre route we are taking to  Bremen  we  have to leave today. I check the
contents of my bag and wallet about 1000  times, and yes, my passport and ticket
are still there.

It is at almost exactly midday  that  I  bid  farewell to Abermule and board the
train for old London town (or  "the  big  smoke"  as I believe it affectionately
called).

The only incident of any  note  during  the  train  journey was the conversation
between two old dears on my right.  They  were  speaking  out on one of the hard
hitting issue of the day  which  was  gripping  the  nation: Rolf Harris and his
suitability as a presenter of "Animal Hospital".

"He's only in it for the money." muttered one darkly.
"Oh, but he loves the little animals..."
"No he doesn't! It's all just an act".

And so it went on from Watford to Whipsnade, Rolf Harris's ulterior motives were
dissected in the manner of an acedemic debate.

By the time I arrived in London  I  was  weary of this Harris-ology and I slowly
made my way for the  Victoria  coach  station.  My bag was getting exponentially
heavier with every step.

On the way I managed  to  pick  up  an  issue beard-friendly music magazine "The
Wire" and I also bought a  copy  of  "Hi-Fidelity"  by Nick Hornby, some reading
matter that should ease the boredom of the coach journey.

I arrived at Victoria with many hours  to  spare before my departure. I had only
just lit my first cigarette when Tat turned up. We chatted about his forthcoming
demo "Sonoluminesenz". Tat's main concern was that he didn't have enough effects
to cover the five or so minutes  of  music.  The demo was only half complete. It
was not finished. It would never be finished. I just hoped that after 2 years of
waiting he would finally complete this demo.

Our queue for the bus was marginally  delayed  by an Irish couple who had missed
their coach for  5  minutes  and  would  subsequently  have  to  wait  until the
following day for a coach.

Our coach eventually arrived and we made  a dash for the luggage compartment and
after making sure our bags were secure headed  on board. No matter where you sit
on a Euro-lines coach you are  guaranteed  of  having  a silent German couple in
front of you and some loud English  tourists  behind. And the English are ALWAYS
complaining about how they shouldn't have taken  the coach, how this will be the
last time they will ever go on a  coach, how they should have flown instead. You
get the picture.

Eurolines usually show videos on the afternoon  and evening coaches and this was
no exception. On our last visit to Germany we were treated to "Four Weddings and
A Funeral" in Danish. We wondered what  cinematical treat our hosts had lined up
for us, whatever it was, we decided it couldn't be worse than "Weddings".

How wrong can you be? Ladies  and  Gentlemen we present "Renaissance Man". Never
heard of it? Well neither had I,  but  Tat  (The Barry Norman of the Falcon demo
scene) was quick  to  fill  me  in  with  the  facts.  Danny  DeVito (fat bloke,
resembles Bob Hoskins but doesn't try to  sell you telephones) has been hired by
the army to teach Shakespeare to  recruits. Sound implausible? Definitely. Sound
complete and utter bobbins? Absolutely.

I tried my best to ignore  DeVito  and  buried  my  head  into Nick Hornby for a
couple of miles. Unfortunately the air conditioning on the coach had broken down
and it was unfeasibly hot. I was also  wearing about ten layers of clothes and I
truly I believed I was going  to  die, I  felt  so ill. Like the moaning English
tourists behind me, I resolved never to travel on a coach again.

It was welcome relief to get off the  coach at Dover and onto the ferry. Neither
of us were in the mood for alcoholic  beverages  so we settled down with a quiet
mineral water and tackled the the NME  crossword with a pop knowledge that would
have Mike "pop quiz" Reid looking over his shoulder.

I was so shattered that I tried to sleep  for  a bit on the ferry - never a good
idea with the undulations of the water  further unsettling my stomach. Instead I
stocked up on duty free tobacco and headed back to the coach.

The Trans-Europe-express style  journey  to  Amsterdam  was  fairly eventless. I
managed to sleep most of the way, I seemed to developed a knack of being able to
sleep on coaches which is  beginning  to  come  in  very  handy.  I did awake in
Holland to hear news of another  IRA  bomb.  Someone  should tell them that Bill
Gates is a Loyalist.

Arriving at Amsterdam at 8.00am I felt like ... shit.

I felt truly awful.

The "Amsterdam coach station" turned out to  be  a  little hut so tiny there was
barely room to squeeze through the door.

Tat decided he needed the toilet, and  unable to find any suitable facilities he
had to make a dash to  some  nearby  foilage.  I  was  half expecting him to get
arrested by the police. Amsterdam - soft on drugs, hard on urinators.

We boarded our coach to Hamburg and  settled  down for the final stretch of this
epic journey.

Call me Mr-bloody-obvious but it has  to  be  said  that  Holland is a very flat
country and the scenery falls in two distinct categories:

a) flat and dull
b) flat and dull

Well that's only one, but  we did  our  best  to  bring  some variation into the
monotony by laughing at windmills  and  looking  out  for  clogs. I kept my eyes
peeled for the field on "Holland: Field Of  Screams" from Twisted Metal 2 on the
GayStation. I kept thinking that I'd  spotted  it,  but when we got closer there
were no clipping errors or nasty distortion so I must have been mistaken

A battalion of bridges  hailed  our  arrival  in  Hamburg,  not  one of the most
glamorous of European cities. But  if  pornography  and bridges are "your thing"
then this is somewhat of a Mecca.

Lo-fi indie band Pavement recently visited Hamburg  by coach and were greeted by
hail of bullets by a psychotic gunman. Fortunately our welcome was less violent.

Waiting diligently at the Coach station for us  were Agent T of Cream and Jet of
Avena. Unfortunately neither of them had a  car  so  we had to negotiate our way
through the Hamburg underground system. We stopped  off at a supermarket to pick
up some essentials (Pizza and lots of  Coke)  and then dragged ourselves over to
Agent T's place. By this point my  bag was threatening to pull my shoulder blade
off. Fortunately I managed to make it to  the appartment without the loss of any
vital limbs.

We had a good chat with Agent T about the Falcon scene. The big news was that he
had tracked down Mad Max to a  small  village  in Germany and had invited him to
the Siliconvention. The  thought  of  seeing  Jochen  Hippel  in  the  flesh was
overwhelming. The man is a living legend in  the mould of the Dalai Llama or Lee
Perry.

Agent T had also  recently  interviewed  Centek, the company behind the exciting
"Phenix" project and showed me an article about it in ST Computer.

I saw a preview of "Sonolumineszenz",  and  even  in  its uncomplete state I was
staggered. I knew even then that it was  going  to win the demo competition by a
considerable margin.

Tat and I set our computers up and did  a couple of hours of coding before sleep
caught up with us. I may have been  sleeping  on an old sofa in the kitchen, but
compared to the conditions I had endured over the last 28 hours it was heaven!

We rose at about lunch time on Thursday.  I  did a lot of coding on "God-Boy" my
Gameboy emulator. At this time it wasn't really working at all and I had to code
a Gameboy disassembler so  I  could  see  which  portions  of  the Z80 code were
causing the problems.

Tat worked feverishly on his demo trying to  come up with some new effects to go
into the final half of it.

Agent T busied himself by constructing some  logos  for the demo. He also showed
me the graphics he was to be entering  into the competitions and once again they
were stunning. The man is in a class of his own on the Falcon at present.

Late on Thursday evening Arne of Avena turned up.

"I am farting very well" he announced, this being the only English phrase he can
master, and to be frank the only phrase he will ever need.

Packing all our stuff into his  car  was  a  miracle  of compression. I ended up
wedged underneath a massive box of  Symposium  T-shirts and spent the journey in
massive discomfort. It was only then that  Arne  announced that we would also be
picking up Jet and his computer equipment!

The packing miracles required  to  fit  an  extra  person, monitor, computer and
baggage into this car was  of  biblical  proportion.  Our  solution came when we
depacked all the T-shirts from  their  original container and recursively packed
them back into the car.

Although it was cramped, the journey from  Hamburg to Bremen was quite enjoyable
as Arne slapped a tape of Tommy's  tunes  into  the car stereo so we were racing
down the autobahn to the sound of the  Avena  Fried Bits 3 demo! I half expected
the car to crash when the tune reached the z-buffer balls part!

We stopped at the Siliconvention  party  place  in  Hannover. This was a massive
hall resembling an aircraft hangar and already  at midnight the day before there
were plenty of organisers there sorting things out. People were unloading tables
from a massive truck and some PC  crews  had  set  up in the hall. No doubt they
were playing link-up Doom or writing a demo in Visual Basic or whatever these PC
people do. The partyplace looked a bit  grim,  just one massive hall. These type
of parties are always a bit soulless  and  lacking in  atmosphere and I was very
glad we were going to the Siliconvention instead.

We left Jet and his computer bits at  the Symposium and headed to Bremen for the
real party. We arrived at the party  place at about 1am expecting the organisers
to be performing  similar  feats  to  those  at  the  Symposium.  We  were sadly
mistaken. The building was locked up and the whole place was deserted.

It was time for Plan B. We  headed  for  Mr  Coke's house in Delmenhourst some 5
miles away. After several unanswered knocks at  the door we succeeded in rousing
the Coke-man with some well aimed stones  at  the window. A sleepy Jorg admitted
us into his living room and here we chatted until about 3am. Well, Tat, Coke and
Arne chatted in German and I  read  some  "exciting" technical manuals about the
Motorola 68330 - one of the chips used by the Phenix.

I had a disturbed nights sleep on a camper bed. All through the night gale force
winds whistled through the local  alleys  sending  bins, paper and other objects
that make annoying banging sounds flying about.

Mr. Coke got up at about 6am and  there  was much too-ing and fro-ing as he took
stuff to the  partyplace.  We  nobly  tried  to  sleep  through  this but failed
dismally. We awoke at about 9am feeling  awful.  Mr.  Coke has a pet bird of the
parrot type (I'm no ornithologist) that  squawked at roughly 2 minutes intervals
throughout the night. By  9am  in  the  morning  thought  of poisons, knives and
cooking pots had been swimming around  my  head  as  ever more ghastly ends were
devised for this pesky creature.

We arrived at the Burgerhaus, the main  party place at about 10am. Already there
were some people there. Sitting in  a  corner  was Dead Hackers Society and some
other Swedish people, and sitting by the bar were two Polish guys who turned out
to be Grey of Shadows and Winio.

Grey told me that the Shadows  demo  was  complete  and  it was going to be very
impressive. He was quite confident  that  it  would  win the demo competition. I
looked forward to seeing it but Grey wasn't going to show it to anyone until the
night of the competition.

Downstairs an extra hall was open  to  partygoers.  At  Fried Bits this had been
used just to show the  demos  as  it  had  been  booked  for strange occult type
worship sessions (possibly involving Pandemonium and Spirits) during the day. It
was now full of C64 dudes and some PC people.

There was a Pacman arcade at reception  and  a prize was promised for the person
who got the  highest  score  on  this  machine.  There  was  also a "multi-media
information point" - a computer showing  some  nice hi-res digitised pictures of
the convention. It was a surprise  to  learn  that  this was actually Mr. Coke's
Falcon, not some high end PC with fancy graphics card!

We went hunting for a room, and initially  chose the one which had been occupied
by Lazer and Aggression during the Fried  Bits  3.  We then decided to move into
the adjoining room where Lazer,  Inter  and  Absence  had  already set up. After
unpacking all our equipment we realised our  small but fundamental error. We had
not got enough plugs. Fortunately some  guy  with  a Power Mac sitting behind us
lent us a four adaptor. Big up for this, whoever you are.

At last we were tooled up and ready to rock.

I continued work on my Gameboy  emulator  and Tat continued putting together the
demo. We were right in the corner and  not overlooked so Tat could at least keep
the demo secret from some of the attendees.

Soon Mod of TSCC came over  and  introduced  himself.  We  had a long chat about
Undercover mag, Maggie, and TSCC's demo plans.He showed me around the Undercover
interface, although I still think the Maggie one  beats it! It is great to see a
magazine like Undercover providing strong scene coverage, long may it continue.

Mod explained the reasons why he  had  left  TNB  and joined TSCC. It looks like
TSCC now have the potential to be one of  the biggest and best demo crews on the
scene.

Soon after fellow TSCC member MC  Lazer  appeared  and  we had a long chat about
music. Apparently Lazer was going to perform  a  DJ  set on one of the nights of
the party but this had to  be  cancelled.  This  was  a real shame. Still he did
inform me  that  he  was  writing  a  tune  for  TSCC's  entry  into  the 96ktro
competition.

Flinny then turned up. He had flown  to  Hamburg  and  got a train from there to
Bremen. He was visibly  shaken  after  spending  so  long  away from IRC channel
Atari. He hadn't brought his Falcon along,  just  a hard drive to be filled with
whatever he could get his hands on.  He  had  also  brought a selection of swear
words and insults that would be later freely given out to the Swedish community.

Professional IRCer and T-Shirt designer  Arnel  turned  up also. He was entering
the Web page design competition, and after  his seminal article on HTML in Atari
Computing, we thought he  couldn't  possibly  fail  to  win. Especially with all
those Tori Amos lyrics.

The first day was characterised by  a  series  of  power cuts. These struck with
alarming regularity leading to frequent loss of code and torrents of swearing in
a multitude of languages emanating from the rooms of the convention. It was even
more galling to hear the Amiga crew set up  on  the other side of the wall to us
was unaffected by the short circuit. As  our  computers died we could still hear
their modules merrily pumping away  (mainly  Juno  Reactor style stuff, one tune
seeming to be a remix of High Energy Protons).

Grey was quite downhearted on the  first  day  as  it seemed like there would be
very few (if any) falcon demos released. But this would all change...

I started work on a Z80 debugger for my Gameboy emulator in the style of Mon-ST.
I coded the actual Z80 disassembler then decided  to get some well earned kip. I
climbed under my table, unrolled my sleeping bag  and got in. As soon as my head
hit the pillow (well the ball of jumpers  and towels that doubled as a pillow) I
immediately stayed wide awake as there was so much noise around me, particularly
from Stax who was composing  a  nice  acidic  module.  I  soon blocked out these
noises and drifted into a disturbed sleep....

....only to be woken at about 6am by the Mac owner who was sitting behind me. It
was bad enough that his friend  had  decided  to  watch EVERY episode of Married
With Children in German through the whole  night  (at high volume) but worse was
to come. Sitting about 2 feet  from  my  head  were 3 foot high mission speakers
connected to his computer. And  at  6am  he  decided  to  listen to every single
Gameboy tune in his collection AT  FULL  VOLUME.  This  pieces of music are high
pitched atonal dirges at the best of times,  and this was certainly not the best
of times. My ears were subjected to the aural equivalent of the dentist's drill.
I struggled on for almost an hour trying  to  block this out as I was completely
shattered, but to no avail. In  a  rather  bad  mood,  I stumbled out of bed and
headed off outside for a cigarette in attempt to cheer myself up.

Once I had  some  caffeine  and  tobacco  circulating  around  my  system I felt
considerably better. People were getting up and  I  got back to coding. (NOTE: I
am writing this whilst my Falcon  is  away  having  a Nemesis fitted and I can't
type the word 'code' or 'coding'  without  breaking  out into a cold sweat. It's
cold turkey. Coding is more addictive than drugs - just say no kids!)

As the rest of the party woke up  and put their computers on, the power problems
resurfaced. The leccy was going off  more  often  than  Vinnie Jones in a grudge
match. Just like  Chumbawumba,  we  opened  our  eyes  and  decided  "enough was
enough". As the Amiga crew relocated themselves downstairs with their inadequate
mates, we took over their place. This  means  we  were sitting out in one of the
main corridors, but in  the  cul-de-sac  at  the  end  so  we didn't have people
pushing past us. Quite a crowd gathered  whenever  Tat was testing his demo, and
the rhythm of collective jaws hitting the floor when sono-virgins saw it for the
first time could have been sculpted into a drum'n'bass soundscape.

We were soon  joined in this  corridor  corner  by  Agent  T   who made a lot of
suggestions to Tat about the demo and knocked up some more brilliant graphics. I
finished my debugger, but still the games were refusing to work.

About this time I met some of the  Dutch  people. Pieter van der Meer, author of
Neurobotix, was  "in  the  house".  He  had  coded  a  4k  intro  for  the  demo
competition, but most of his time was spent working on his new Falcon game. This
will be a 3D shooter/trading game in the  style of Elite. It is a very ambitious
and complex project, let's hope he  can  complete  it because early signs looked
promising.

Another Dutch guy who  I  met  was  Com7.  He  had  definitely  brought the most
equipment of anyone. Not only had he  got  his Falcon, monitor and zip drive but
he had brought his  entire  music  studio!  This  consisted  of his mixing desk,
keyboards, drum machines and midi modules (some  in  big racks). In the words of
Hixxy and Sharkey, absolutely 'bonkers'!

Com7 was unusual in the fact that he  owns  a C-Lab Falcon. He played me some of
the stuff he has composed on  Cubase  Audio  and  I  was very impressed with the
sound quality. The vocal samples were crisp and crystal clear. In fact the songs
were all very cool and I wish him the best of luck with Bassment Productions.

He also showed me some interesting features  on  Cubase I hadn't worked out. And
he let me play on his SH-101! Sadly  it  had  had an accident and one of it keys
had snapped in half, but  it  still  sounded  awesome.  The classic machines are
always the best.

It was also great to hear Com7  putting  the  music to AirDirt and Double Bobble
2000 through his mixing desk!

The upstairs seemed to be the most  active  place  of the party, apart from what
had been the main room at FB3 - the  big one that opened out onto the balcony. I
think everyone assumed it would be packed  again  and avoided it, so it ended up
with only 3 people in it!

The next room along was totally taken  over  by  the  Dutch - Com7 and his music
studio, Fun, Tos-Crew, Sentry, Earcheoptorix software - all the usual suspects.
They suspended a huge Atari banner above the doorway, and mangaed to utilise the
big video screen to display  the  usual  selection  of demos, slasher movies and
episodes of Ren and Stimpy.

Opposite the Dutch room was the Undercover real-time article which ran on Tempus
on a Mega-ST. Unfortunately this was  quite  badly  struck by the power cuts and
lost quite a lot of text. But then real-time articles are always full of crap so
perhaps this wasn't much of a loss!

TSCC lived in the room beyond the article. Here they frantically worked on their
96ktro, a demo which you, the kids, have  already clutched close to your hearts.
Also in here were Escape working  on Sili-Con-Carne, Therapy and some ex-Spirits
guy. Also in the corner was  Juri  from  New-Line  was, as ever, making some ace
acid tunes.

The room at the  far  end  of  this  corridor  had  some  Playstations and other
consoles stuck setup so you could play  on  them. Personally I think they should
have had some 2600's in there, now that is a REAL console!

If you turned left before entering the console zone you would get to walk up the
main Atari corridor. On the left were  the  sleeping rooms. On the right was the
spot where Hat-Trick memorably slept  at  FB3  and  woke  to find people had put
coins in his hat.

The spirit of the Swede was alive and  well  in the next room where Dead Hackers
Society, No Crew and some other Scandinavian types made their headquarters. This
was the loudest and maddest, nay, "wackiest" room, probably in the entire world.

It was from here that the juggling  originated.  If  Obelix had turned up to the
party he would have tapped his head and mutted "These Swedes are crazy"!

The second door on the right was the  room  containing TNB and RDT. As you would
expect RDT spent the entire time working  on  Running, which I have to say looks
absolutely superb. I think it is  one  of  the best presented Falcon games ever.
Full credit to RDT, they haven't just coded  a Doom clone and bolted a "game" on
afterwards, they have meticulously designed the  game  and the levels. And as it
utilises the DSP well it runs at a good  turn of pace. This looks like being the
game of the year! Don't forget to  register  for  this and thank RDT for all the
effort they have put into this game.

TNB coded their controversial ST demo  here,  controversial  in the fact that it
won the demo competition after a mix up  in votes. I personally thought it was a
very good demo, the  best  on  the  ST  I've  seen  for  a  long time. Drizzt is
definitely a hardcore coder - no matter  what  time  of day or night I went into
this room, even if everyone else at the  party was asleep, Drizzt would be there
with Turbo Assembler loaded typing away. Respect!

TNB also scoop the Philip  Morris  award  for  services  to the tobacco industry
after having smoked enough to make Bill Hicks blush. Therapy ran a close second,
but yet again only got the silver medal.

The final room on the top  floor  held  Lazer,  Inter, Absence and the noisy Mac
owners who loved "Married With Children". We were not sorry to move out into the
corridor, just to avoid Al Bundy.

And out in the corridor sat Tat,  Agent  T  and  myself. We were later joined by
Fried of Avena and provided a second home for Flinny and Arnel.

We did get to visit the supermarket  on  Saturday,  which is always a treat. For
some bizarre reason, German shops  are  NEVER  open,  so  whenever a shop is not
closed it is rammed with people. The small supermarket in Bremen was rammed with
demo coders - I bet they've never sold so much Coke, Pizza and general junk food
in one go before. I bought some American style burger rolls (which turned out to
be foul), chocolate bars  (which  were  also  unpleasant), dairylea style cheese
stuff and some dry roast peanuts which really did the trick.

The day flashed by in a whizz of coke and code.

Grey  of  Shadows  spent  a  lot of the time worrying about the Pandemonium demo 
which was supposed to be sent to him via e-mail. He regularly popped down to the
internet cafe to see if it had arrived.

Flinny and Arnel also made a beeline to the internet connection point. How could
IRC survive without them?

Mad Max turned up in the evening. It was amazing to see this legendary figure in
the flesh! He spent most of the time  chatting  with Tao, Stax and Tommy. He was
very impressed with Tao's Sid chip emulator. Big  Mad  Max news - he has cut his
hair! More interesting news: he has a  number  of pieces of as yet unreleased ST
music which may soon surface.

A highlight came when Winio set up his  Atari  XL. This has been upgraded to run
with 1 meg of memory! The disk drive is mad, you actually have to turn the disks
over to read both sides! It has diagonal  function keys like the Falcon but only
about five of them and these do things like reset the computer.

He showed us some of the best XL  demos, and the biggest crowd of the convention
gathered round. The demos were amazing!  Gouraud shading, Texture mapping, Wolf-
3D stuff and even environment mapping on a  humble 8-bit. If any of these Polish
XL and XE coders get hold of a Falcon the results will be devastating.

We didn't really get much sleep on Saturday night/Sunday morning.

Tat spent  the  time  feverishly  putting  the  finishing  touches  to  Sono and
miraculously got a version completed for the 8am deadline.

Its funny how deadlines can make people  so productive. What would normally take
crews months to complete is done in one  night if there is a deadline hanging in
the air!

The demo competitions were held in a big hall downstairs. There were two screens
with two viewing areas -  a  bad  idea  in  my  opinion  as this split the crowd
reaction and diluted the demos impact somewhat.

I didn't get to see all  the  demo  competitions,  I was particularly annoyed to
miss the 4k competition but I think  I  was  so  busy coding at the time that it
passed me by.

There was a "fake demo" competition, which must surely have been inspired by the
Senior Dads efforts at previous  conventions.  The  entries  on the PC and Amiga
were actually rather polished, I  don't  think  they quite understood what "fake
demo" meant.

By far  and  away  the  best  entry  was  F6  by  Cream,  a  parody  of  Avena's
"Sonolumineszenz". Unfortunately as the  fake  competition  was shown before the
main competition, most people didn't get the  real  joke and just laughed at the
comedy effects. This was  a  case  of  satire  being  so  topical  it had almost
travelled in time! I was absolutely pissing myself  when I saw it, but there was
general bafflement from the Amiga people sitting around me.

One fake demo on the PC  took  the  piss  out  of old demo effects like sinewave
scrollers and big credits sequences. It was  a  bit  too snidey and clever to be
really entertaining though.

There was a minimal Amiga entry called  "waiting for pizza" which didn't seem to
do much. I can't really remember this or  any of the other entries so they can't
have been that good.

The RISC PC competition featured  some  very  impressive demos. Unfortunately as
most people didn't really know the full  capabilities of this obscure machine it
was hard to tell if they were well coded or it was just the super fast computers
doing all the donkey work.  It's hard  to  appreciate  a  demo when taken out of
context of its whole scene.

One of them featured  quite  a  nice  3D  world  with  an illegible text effect.
Although the 3D was very  good,  it  stayed  on  the  same  scene for the entire
duration of the demo and it rapidly became quite dull.

One of the other ones had some quite flashy hi-res effects, but there was little
in the way of design. Nice but not exceptional.

The advent of the 96k competition was  greeted  with some relief - at last, some
Atari demos!

The first 96ktro was  an  Archimedes  effort  which  was  another 3D world. This
looked like it was in 16 colour mode  and  was very minimal - ie there were very
few objects in it. The  camera  just  rolled  down  a street, a "hurricane" came
along and lifted up a house and dropped it (very poorly animated). The only nice
effect was when the streetlights came  on,  but  all  in  all it could have been
written on an ST. In GFA basic. Not great.

Another Archie demo  featured  some  chequered  curved  voxel  style  hills with
terrible clipping. Calling it awful would be a compliment.

There may have been another Archie demo,  I  can't really remember (I'm not much
good at this convention documenting  lark  am  I?  Best  stick  to coding!) I do
remember that all the Archie intros had quite terrible music.

There was an Amiga A1200 demo that was slightly better. It had some nice 2D bump
mapping and some very slow 3D.  Watching  SONO after this nicely illustrated the
difference in power between the A1200  and  the  Falcon. You really need a 50Mhz
Amiga to do any decent 3D effects.

It was great to see TNB releasing an ST  intro and I haven't seen many demos for
this old beast for a while. It was also a bit of a corker. Lots of nice effects,
good design and music. Some effects  (e.g.  the  burning teddy bear) hung around
the screen for rather too long, but overall  this  is a very classy demo. I hope
it runs on the Falcon!

TSCC's demo was the most impressive  of  the  bunch. Fantastic music by MC Lazer
were ably complemented by Mod's  great  graphics.  TSCC  seem  to get better and
better every year. Six Sievert features  a  nice enhancement of the burning tree
thing (as  seen  in  "Terrorise  Your  Soul")  as  well  as  some  nice  3D. The
environment mapping was especially good. My only  slight complaint is that it is
a bit short, especially compared to  TYS,  but  overall  this is the best Falcon
96ktro seen since the Fried Bits 3.

I missed both the  module  competition  and  the  C64 competition. After sitting
through the drudgery of music competitions in  the  past, I decided to give it a
miss.

There were no PC,  Amiga,  Archimedes  or  RISC  PC  entries  for  the main demo
Competition, and yet there were five Falcon  entries! The scene is really coming
back to life in a big way.

Therapy were very unlucky.

When  they  handed  in  their competition entry they forgot to copy an important 
file to the floppy.

So their demo was running along nicely - it is undoubtably their best yet - when
the screen goes blank and  it  crashes.  Its  a  real  shame  for the members of
Therapy who obviously put a lot  of  effort  into  this entry and didn't get the
reward they deserved.

Polish new-boys "Pandemonium" unveiled their debut Falcon release "Ignis".

This is a very bizarre demo  with  strong  satanic  undertones, perhaps it is an
extreme reaction to the Spirits bonkers 4ktro.

The effects themselves are pretty  old  hat  -  magnifying lenses, fire vectors,
gouraud shaded cubes, fire greets. Its rather like Obnoxious covered by Northern
Uproar.

Still its quite well presented  and  features  some  very nice graphics and good
music which is well linked to the effects. Its impressive for a first effort and
lets hope they are a bit more original with their next release.

"Sili-Con-Carne" was Escape's  play  on  words  and  also  their rather splendid
demos. The effects defy description,  mainly  lots  of  wibbly plasma stuff, but
*good* wibbly plasma stuff. In  fact  it  is  the  Alan Shearer of wibbly plasma
stuff. I'm just glad I don't actually have  to  do a proper review of it because
the words to describe the effects haven't yet been invented.

Its good to see a demo  with  lots  of  original  effects.  Oh, and the music is
brilliant too.

Shadows  have  been  promising  great  things   for  a  while,  and  with  their
Siliconvention entry they finally delivered.  Some  brilliant bump mapping, even
3D bump mapping are the highlight of  this  demo. The 3D is all technically very
good if a little slow as they don't use the DSP. This demo would surely have won
the competition if it wasn't for...

Sonoluminesznez. Need I say any more?

Well ok then.

Lets just say that many  jaws  hit  the  floor  when the environment mapped fish
started swimming across the screen.

By the end of the demo, some coders of rival Falcon demos were close to tears.

I remember the feeling of  awe  when  Lost  Blubb and especially Eko-System were
unveiled in a different hall in the same building in 1995.That feeling was alive
in 1997 when this incredible Avena demo hit the screen.

It was almost unfair to put this competition to a vote.

Sonolumineszenz won with a landslide that would make even Tony Blair envious.

Tat had been on edge during the run up to demo showing. This was unsuprising but
he needn't have worried as Sono, like the  Avena demo at FB3, led a charmed life
and worked perfectly. It was only after it had been displayed that he started to
find all the nasty bugs in it!  So  if  you  got  the party version of this demo
don't forget to upgrade to release 1.2!

After the demos had finished and  a  non  Atari  competition appeared on the big
screen I drifted to an almost  deserted  upstairs.  I  can't be sure but I think
Drizzt of TNB was still hunched over Turbo Assembler!

I was just doing a spot of coding on  my Falcon when Tommy of Avena walked over.
He noticed the "Mr. Tickle" badge on my Falcon and remarked on its similarity to
his Plastikman tattoo. This launched us  into a lengthy discussion about Ritchie
Hawtin and his matery of the TB-303.  We  discovered  that we had a very similar
taste in music and I promised to catch his live performance later that night.

Tommy had just sold his Amiga - the computer he used to compose all his music on
- and was now using the hardware sequence  in  his MC-303 to write tunes. He was
thinking about buying an old ST just  to  use cubase. Although he isn't too much
in touch with the Falcon demo scene he was very enthusiastic about Sono.

I messed around with God-Boy for a while  whilst Tat did some general bug fixing
on Sono. At around 2am we headed downstairs to catch Tommy's live set.

Tommy was performing with  a  friend,  the  two  of  them  were hunched over the
keyboards and 303s like a Germanic version of the chemical brothers. The visuals
were supplied by a rather inept cameraman who  kept zooming into the keys on the
keyboard and other mundane things. It would  have  been better if they had run a
demo or even Jeff Minters VLM in the background.

Unfortunately the set was bedevilled with technical problems. Just as a tune got
going it would totally cut out.  Parts  would  crash  in  and  out of the mix at
unintentional points. It was a real shame  as  I'd heard Tommy jamming with Juri
of Newline in a  small  room  for  hours  and  it  had  all been seamless. These
glitches spoiled an othewise fine display  and  were  the reason for Tommy's low
count of votes. I still placed him first in the compo!

Monday morning was votes time. The program  used  to display the votes was a GFA
one by Mr. Coke that had been used  at the last Siliconvention! There were quite
a few hiccups, most notably when they got  the votes the wrong way round for C64
crews "plush" and "plop". Quite a few winners weren't there so people lower down
the order had to pick up the prizes.

There was a bit of a surprise  in  the  96ktro competition with TNB winning. Not
only had they beaten the Amiga and Archie entries, but also the much admired Six
Sievert by TSCC. The faces of the members of TSCC said it all!

They were brightened by the news that they had won the 4ktro with their stunning
bump mapping effect which even runs on the ST.

In the main demo  competition  their  could  be  only  one.  Sono  won it by the
proverbial country mile. "It" by Shadows was runner up.

Tat picked up his prize, a  spanking  new  Nintendo 64, beaming like Burnley had
just won the FA Cup.

Agent T picked up a prize for  his rendered picture, but unfortunately he didn't
win the pixel competition. His prize  for  the rendered compo was a Playstation,
something he audibly groaned at, as he hates the machine.

The final day was soon on us and people were starting to pack up and weave their
merry ways back to their own  countries.  Nearly  everyone  agreed it had been a
great party, as good  as  the  classic  Fried  Bits  parties and certainly miles
better than the dull PC oriented Symposium.

I got chatting with Martina of Lazer  and  she  revealed that she was keen to do
another demo on the Falcon, but it  was  lack  of time that was preventing. Stax
helpfully suggested that they  should  do  naturist  remix  of "Lost Blubb" with
Martina dancing naked throughout it!

Martina then demonstrated to the world how  to do a handstand. The inter members
dismally tried this for themself with  Questor comically collapsing into a heap.
Lucky fared a little better. The  building  them  shook as Stax threw himself at
the wall. It was  down  to  Energizer  and  Tommy  of  Avena  to  do a handstand
masterclass.

Just before we had to leave  I  had  a  chance  to chat with Lucky and Innovator
about their new Falcon demo "Interview" which should be released at the Intercon
in November. It should have about 12  new  effects, the bulk of them being coded
by Lucky. They also demonstrated  to  me  their ill-fated Wolf-3D clone, "Arena"
and I have to say it is the fastest engine  of this type that I have seen on the
Falcon. As they are no longer working on it,  they gave me the source code and I
hope to turn it into a proper game when I get the time.

Fried of Avena was getting itchy feet  so  we  finally said the long goodbye and
headed for his car. This sharp exit  was  ill  advised as we found ourself stuck
behind Mr Ni of TOS crew who seemed to have brought half of Holland with him and
was spending hours carefully arranging it  in  his car (usually highly optimised
compression routines obviously. Amazing how he  could remember all those command
line switches). After ten minutes or so Fried got out and remonstrated with him,
and Mr. Ni "relocated" his car so we could past.

It was then fun-fun-fun on the Autobahn all the way back to Hamburg with a brief
stop for Fried to eat a garlic snack  as his luxurious villa. Agent T managed to
sleep most of the way back  using  the  Playstation  he  had won as a pillow (at
least we found one use for it!)

Back at Agent T's we had  a  well  earned  sleep  -  something that was in short
supply at the party. The next day we  had  a  chance  to try out the PSX and the
demo cd. We were appalled at the low  quality of some of the games, although the
hilarous clipping errors gave us lots  of  amusement. The vanishing trees in the
golf game was a particular highlight. Paul Daniels couldn't have done it better.

Agent T spent a lot of time trying to  get on the internet to download the other
Siliconvention entries but his "hotline to  the  net" seemed engaged most of the
time. Tat fixed some  nasty  clipping  bugs  in  Sono  (obviously inspired after
seeing the Playstation) and I  finally  got  God-Boy  running! You could at last
play Bubble Bobble although it was horrendously slow and the collision detection
didn't work.

We spoke to Thyroxin and Jet of Avena  who had helped to organise the Symposium,
a PC and Amiga party  on  the  same  weekend  as  Siliconvention. They said they
didn't  enjoy  this  much  -  the  atmosphere  was  bad  with  many  unfriendly,
egotistical crews not talking to  each  other.  Some  people were kicked out for
throwing bottles about. This sounds the antithesis of an Atari party and we were
glad that we missed it.

The Atari scene is characterised  by  friendly  people  who genuinely love their
machine and have a real interest in what  everyone else is doing, whereas the PC
scene is characterised by egotism and  one-upmanship.  It  is the refuge of  the
mercenary and lamer, those who judge others  by  the speed of their processor or
size of their memory. Whatever the  merits  of  the  PC scene are, it will never
have the spirit of the Atari scene. Parties like Siliconvention really emphasise
this difference.

The Siliconvention was a better  party  than  I  could  have possibly hoped for,
especially after the Symposium. It was  reasonably small, intimate, friendly and
most importantly, a lot of fun. It also produced a lot of fantastic releases.

It was brilliant to see  so  many  people  still  actively involved in the Atari
scene, some people who we had given up for dead months ago. There was a sense of
the Atari scene being reborn with new sense of direction and new energy.


We went Around The World and Siliconvention '97 definitely had Da Funk.
