        "Yo-Yo!  Yes, I'm back once again, it's the renegade munkster.
The one and only Blue Monkey in the place, fresh from a run with those
crazy ST+ geezers, ready and  set  to  make  yous Maggie mobsters open
wide and sample my flava.
        "Well, my monkey chums, where  have  I  been over the past few
months?  Where haven't I been, that's  what I say.  I've been cruisin'
round L.A. with the babes, shooting  dead  as many American rappers as
my big smoker can handle, while here at home I've been hanging with my
home boys and generally chillin' like a baadaass babboon on downers.
        "Nice one."

        "I understand many of yous won't be in the lingo with what I'm
all about and up to, well let me tell yer a little something.  I, Blue
Monkey, do the 'phoning, all the time on the telephone line, but these
ain't no ordinary Phone-Ins, Billy.   No,  my friends, these Phone-Ins
are Phoney Phone-Ins.
        "During my stay  on  ST+,  I  frequently  'phoned  up software
companies and stupid computer  shops,  winding  up  the  dim and dopey
staff with all the pranks, Banks,  while recording our little exchange
of lingo onto an  audio  cassette,  before  finally turning the entire
conversation, word for ruddy word, into words-on-computer-screen form,
much like what I've done for you today, Kay.  Okay?"

        "They were the old days, so  now: Computer games stores?  Pah.
Software houses?  Old news,  for  kanger-stinking-roos.  Now, I'm onto
the bigs whos wigs are so big that they nearly snap their filthy necks
in half wearing 'em.
        "Yes, Monkey mates everywhere, because the other day I 'phoned
up none other than  Bob  Russell,  Parliament  member with the Liberal
Democrats and wound him right up Paddy's silly middle-wing nostrils.
        "It's no joke, after a little contact number rootin', I really
did contact Bob  Russell  the  Hustle(r  reader),  pretending  to be a
swanky pranky journalist  from  a  local  newspaper  that doesn't even
exist.
        "Of course, the idiot bought it  like a crazy Iraqy man trying
to buy  something  that's  really  cheap  and  the  rest  is political
history.
        "Get some mugs in, muggins, drink  a toast and eat some cooked
bread, before 'racing some trannies' by reading my account.  Top one."


Bob Russell, Colchester Candidate for the Liberal Democrats.

 [phone rings, gets picked up]
MP      : [deep, jolly voice] Hello?
Blue    : Oh, Hi.  Bob Russell, is it?
MP      : Yes.
Blue    : Liberal Democrat MP?
MP      : Yes.
Blue    : Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester?
MP      : Yes, how can I help?
Blue    : Bob Russell, Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester, that's
          going to lose the approaching election like a randy dog with
          a 'stickler'?
MP      : Pardon?  Who is this?  Is this a serious call?
Blue    : Hi.  Tony Shagstrees - I'm from The Suffolk Echo.
MP      : The Suffolk Echo?
Blue    : Yeah, The Echo.  Are you a reader?
MP      : Don't you mean the East Anglian Daily Times?
Blue    : No, that's more of a rival than anything else, Bob.  We're
          of much more of an elitist mind and a lot sharper than the
          shabby old East Anglian.  Wouldn't you say that?
MP      : Frankly, I've never heard of you...
Blue    : ..Oh..
MP      : ...Where are you based?
Blue    : Never heard of us?  Really?  What and you're the SDP, sorry,
          Liberal Democrat candidate for Colchester?  Our offices are
          only in Stowmarket.  That's, like, twenty, maybe thirty
          miles away from the area you apparently govern and you have,
          ahem, never heard of us?  Oh dear, that is such a shame, I'm
          sorry but I'm just going to have to write that down.
          [dictates] 'Hasn't.... heard... of.. Echo.'
MP      : [pauses] You say The Echo?
Blue    : Yeeees.
MP      : Now that does ring a few bells.
Blue    : Ahhh...
MP      : I'm sorry, I thought you said, arrr..
Blue    : No, I didn't say 'Arrr'.
MP      : Pardon?
Blue    : I said, I didn't say 'Arrr'.
MP      : No, I thought you said... something else...
Blue    : You know, that is a real X-File.  I say one thing, you hear
          the other, you are a member of parliament, aren't you?
MP      : [laughs a deep, chesty laugh]
Blue    : Did you use to like playing Chinese Whispers as a kid?  I
          did and do you know why?
MP      : Why was that?
Blue    : Because I always changed the message when it got to my turn
          and ruined the whole, stinking game.
MP      : Really?  Well, as a Liberal Democrat, we are not used to
          anything like that.  Now, what did you call to talk about?
Blue    : [cue American accent] Ah, hello?  Did you eat a brain tumour
          for breakfast, or something?  Isn't there, like, an election
          coming up?
MP      : Why, yes, but if you want to discuss that, please, you can
          join me one afternoon at my home, for tea.
Blue    : Will there be scones there?
MP      : [laughs] Yes.
Blue    : I hate scones.  I HATE THEM, YOU HEAR?
MP      : We don't have to have scones..
Blue    : Cut the scones.  Forget about the scones.  Leave the
          blummin' crumpets, well b a c k  t h e e e r e.  I can't
          visit your lovely home, spacious though it is from all that
          money you earn, because I simply don't have the time.
          Though thank you for the offer.  Perhaps you could have an
          extra cup of tea, on me, hmmm?
MP      : As you wish, though you and your colleages are welcome to
          call and discuss any matters, whenever it suits you.
Blue    : Yeah, right.  Recently, I was reading - do you read much?
MP      : Oh yes.  Currently I'm reading Glor...
Blue    : .. Oh, I don't care.  Recently, I was reading that you
          visited a Colchester prision?
MP      : Well, that was the other week.
Blue    : Were you on a bender?
MP      : On a what?
Blue    : Never mind.  In this prision you met up - or should I say
          talked to - a 21 year-old man, who was being arrested for
          performing an armed robbery.  That's right, isn't it?
MP      : Yes, what did you want to know?
Blue    : Didn't this criminal describe to reporters that you are 'a
          good bloke' who 'knows what he's talking about'?
MP      : I didn't read that, but I'm...
Blue    : Isn't that a little rich coming from an armed robber?
MP      : Perhaps, but most people in Essex think of me in such a way.
          It's the way I treat the surrounding communities with such
          intimacy.
Blue    : Don't you go getting intimate with those surrounding
          communities.  I've seen yer.  Out there.  Kissing babies.
MP      : I.. I haven't...
 [finally!  I make an MP stutter!]
Blue    : But this convict also said that he 'didn't trust Tony
          Blair', saying that he has 'something up his sleeve'.
MP      : I think we can all relate to that.
Blue    : But what about this thing up his sleeve?  Could it be a
          shotgun, much like the convict, who said it, held?
MP      : A.. gun?
Blue    : It's a big, pointy thing... Wooden bit on the end... Kills
          people.
MP      : I heard you but.... no.
Blue    : Well, I think so. [pause]
          Now, if the Liberal Democrats get in power in a couple of
          weeks...
MP      : .. When we do get in power, in a couple of weeks..
Blue    : Ah, yeah right.  As if.
          [coughs audibly]  If you were to get in government, what
          would you bring in?  Come on, you can say some realy crazy
          thing if you like - It's not like it's going to happen.
          Lemonade in rivers?  Sweet birds in the sky?  Raindrops on
          roses?  Whiskers on kittens?
MP      : No, no.  It's not far from our grasp.  I wouldn't say that
          it's a dead cert we 'get in government', as you put it, this
          time round, but more and more people...
Blue    : .. Yes you did, that's exactly what you said.  You said that
          you were definitely going to get in.
MP      : Well, no...
Blue    : .. Yes you did, that is precisely what you just stated:  We
          shall make government, easy peasey pudding and pie.
MP      : That's far from the truth...
Blue    : .. My mate Paddy Ashdown will be living in that number 10,
          that's what you said.
MP      : I never said that...
Blue    : .. Yes you did, I heard you.  Paddy will be living in number
          10 and I'll be just next door, playing...
MP      : [interupts] .. Nooo..
Blue    : ... Playing my music really loud and annoying my Lib Dem
          leader.
MP      : That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Blue    : Is it really?  Do you think pickling eggs is ridiculous,
          too?  Or just plain cruel?
MP      : Listen...
Blue    : When you see Paddy Ashdown, when you see him, do yer, do yer
          shout: 'LEADER!'  LEADER!'  [laughs franticly, trying to
          cover mouthpiece]
MP      : Oh my God.  Who is this?
Blue    : What?  What's your problem, major?  Just relaxing the
          interview.
MP      : Hardly an interview, is it?  I want to do this in person, if
          at all, when I can see your face.
Blue    : Oooh, want to see me face now, do you?  Can't we just swap
          descriptions down the 'phone?  Like on one of those chat
          lines?  Talk to MP's you'd like to know better...
MP      : Is there any point to this at all.
Blue    : There's a damn good point to it, actually and a lot of
          people shall see it, but what I really wanted to know is
          your opinion on poor old Moby?
MP      : Who is it now?
Blue    : Moby.  The whale.  In Scotland?
MP      : A stranded whale is rather out of my region, now wha...
Blue    : So you're in with the belief that we should just harpoon the
          bugger and tow it out of there...  Let me just write that
          down.  [dictates] Death.. to all... mammals.  There.
MP      : Listen, I have no more time for this line of questioning.
          I am a busy man, I have things to do in my region, that far
          surpass wiltering conversations.
Blue    : Hardly wiltering, more flourishing than anything.  Now tell
          me Bob - or do I know you well enough to call you Stimpy? -
          Who is your favourite Spice Girl?
MP      : Good day!
 [hangs up]
Blue    : Ahh!  Shock!  The bastard!  No-one hangs up on me...
          Arsehole...
 [tape stops]

        "Who'd have thought it?  The one  person  you can put all your
trust in, a lovely  MP,  ends  up  blowin'  it  and hangin' up.  Yeah,
right.
        "Of course, Bobby boy acted in  the same way all Phoney Phone-
In victims act.  They  chirp  and  prattle,  laugh  and joke, but when
intimidation gets on a  high,  they  start  losing the plot, quibbling
into their handset in confusion, until  they  can stand the pressue no
more.
        "I would say that this  is  officially  the  first time I have
based a Phoney on someone with power,  but having spent ten minutes on
the 'phone to the man, I  can  hardly claim that any thunderbolts were
sent my way.  Though his end must have looked liked a veritable battle
field by the end of it.
        "So, there you go.  My Maggie  debut could not be clearer, now
that everything  is  clean  and  clear.   And  blue.   Like  the  sea.
Although that ain't very  blue  anymore.   But  lets  not go down that
alley again.
        "I shall be back on Maggie.   Back  in a future issue, phoning
the pranks and pranking the  phonies,  in  a  different place, to some
different people, but I'm here to stay, so hey!  Eat whey.  And curds.
        "Until then:

         "Remember me.  I'm the one who has your baby's eyes.
           And you can't have the buggers back.  Alright?"
                                                               Sorted.
