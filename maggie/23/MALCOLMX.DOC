                            Chapter 1

Malcom was fed up, catatonic almost, lost in a mist of random thought,
realising a state of self awareness that can only be achieved by those
who have spent years dedicated  to  doing  exactly the same thing  day
in, and day out.  Week  in  and  week  out,  month  in  and month out,
absolutely nothing. Malcom  was  a  bar man, or  rather  a bar-BELF, a
Biologically Engineered Life Form.

 Mankind had sussed  the  true  nature  of  DNA  years  earlier, after
suddenly realising that the  double-helix  had  in  fact nothing to do
with anything but merely looked cool  for showing off on computers and
other display apparatus. To be  quite  frank  that was the only reason
Nature had used it, as opposed  to  the  nice cylindrical shape it had
originally intended. Thus mankind, dedicated  once  again to being the
smart arse it had  always  been,  decided   it   would produce more of 
itself. Why it wanted this is a  question  that may never be answered.
Mankind did it anyway,  causing  Nature  to  grumble quietly to itself
convinced that a) Nobody likes a  smart  arse  and b) in that it might
become redundant.

 Naturally the  respective  major  religions  had  objections  to this
"Playing God" and Pope Kylie XII stated  that it was not mans place to
play God, after all, God was a  woman.  The only religion that in fact
did not have any objection were  the  Lampists,  who's sole belief was
the only way to true enlightenment  was  through  the use of an angle-
poise lamp. This  religion  was  widely  rejected  by politicians even
though 52% of milkmen were Lampists.

 So mankind went  about  artificially  making  itself  bigger,  like a
reverse genocide  with  people  suddenly  popping  into  existence and
asking "Where the hell's the bar?".  Of  course mankind could not stop
here. It was on an  extreme  ego  trip  (again). It started to produce
improved versions of itself to  perform specific tasks. Nature managed
to convince itself that mankind was just going through a phase so just
sat and  waited  quietly,  coughing  occasionally to  indicate  it was
watching.

 However when the  first  human  condiment  tray  was  brought to life
nature decided  enough  was  enough,  and  threatened  mankind  with a
copyright law suit the likes  of  which  have  never been seen before,
partly because Nature had never threatened  to  sue the arse of anyone
before, but  mostly  because  the  sheer  amount  of  copyright  forms
required  for  everything   ever,   including   the   copyright  forms
themselves, would  not  fit  in  one  small  spherical  universe. Thus
mankind agreed to stop using  DNA  (PAT.  103123810) except within the
agreed terms. As a  sign  of  good  will  Nature  could have the human
condiment tray as Nature thought  it  would  look good on its etherial
sideboard.

 Malcom had a lot on his mind. Being a life form specifically designed
to serve drinks,  clean  glasses,  and  able  to  talk fluent bollocks
didn't have many advantages, and  often  made  him  feel like a second
class citizen, which was technically what he was.

 In the  days  of  BELF  manufacture,  mail  order  delivery  was  big
business, so Malcom arrived on  Ross  154,7  in a crate, second class.
The "Sub-Lite" postal service uses a bizarre quirk of temporal physic-
logistics to allow packages to arrive  before  they have been sent and
being sent second class meant Malcom arrived for work just 2.47 metric
weeks before he was dispatched.

 The bar Malcom worked in what was  a  typical retro '80s or rather it
was a typical 2101AD technobar with  highly illegal oak panelling. The
timber trade had been banned  ever since the  year 2007 when Dr. Logal
Mistavo announced that he had proof  that  trees were indeed a higher
form of life, so naturally  after  an  interview on morning television
with Richard MkII and Judy MkI, 85% of the population believed him. So
by  popular  demand  the  trade  was   banned,  and  by  a  staggering
coincidence Mistavo was a regular. He  ordered a double scotch 'n' LSD
sat in his usual corner, and talked to the wall for 3 hours.

 Malcom leant against the bar, back  hunched  and watched the world go
by. He watched Mistavo talk  to  his  newspaper, he watched the cyber-
cockroaches scurry across the floor, and  watched his own foot flatten
the cyber-cockroaches with a  satisfying  crunch.  He  sighed. Fed up,
Malcom was fed up, totally completely and  utterly fed up. He tried to
convey  his  fed-up-itude  to  Mistavo,  but  due  to  his  biological
programming all that could come out was...

"Good match this afternoon, Mistova"

Mistova looked  at  him  blankly,  that  sort  of  look  which  states
categorically "What in (insert your  own religious figure here)'s name
are you blithering on about you sad pathetic individual!".

 Malcom misinterperated this look completely and continued

"The match, did you see it?"

"Did it involve trees?" was the rather spaced out reply

"Trees? Erm... No, I don't think..."

"What is the bloody  point  then"  replied  Mostavo  "You  have 22 men
kicking the shit out of  some  poor  bloody  piece of plastic inflated
with air, the plastic had no  say  whether  it  was filled with air or
not. Some heartless swine just sticks a pump up its arse and, well you
know."

"What?"

"Oppression Malcom, O..ppres..ion.  Poor  bloody  plastic, you'd never
see the trees taking part in  anything so barbaric...hell, they'd know
better" Mostavo finally got around  to  breathing out and took another
gulp from his glass.

Malcom paused and thought for a moment

"But..." he exclaimed unsurely  "...Trees  are  rooted  to the ground.
Aren't they?"

Mostavo straightened himself in his  chair,  cleared his throat,  gave
Malcom that look again, and  in  a  very authoritative voice exclaimed

"Are you saying trees cannot play sports?"

"Erm..."

"They can you know. I once  saw  a  pine  do  the one hundred yards in
under 4 seconds"

Malcom paused for a moment,  fluent  bollocks  was one thing, but this
was just silly. Here  he  was  in  an  almost  empty  bar arguing with
someone over whether TREES could play  soccer.  He needed an answer of
such awesome profoundness that  Mostavo  would  just  shut up.  Malcom 
found it

"Fuck off?!"

"I did!"

"When?"

"Yesterday"

"You were in here yesterday, and the  day  before. Come to think of it
you have been here every  day  for  the  last  three years. You sa..."

Malcom was sharply interrupted as Mostavo knocked  back his S 'n' LSD,
fell to the floor and started shouting something about ducks. This was
his normal reaction to scotch 'n'  LSD when badly loosing an argument.

People came, people left and somewhere in between they drank too much,
or too little, but never enough. This was something Malcom could never
understand, why could man not find a  balance? Why could man not drink
enough to just  satisfy   his  thirst  for  alcohol?   Why  were these
questions buzzing around his  head,  and  why  was  Mostavo eating his
glass, oblivious to the  blood  gushing  from  his  mouth? Malcom Vid-
phoned the local Paramedic-U-Like who  put  him  on hold and then told
him to get stuffed as they were  washing the blood off the van. Malcom
sighed a long and completely sigh, until there  was no air left in his
lungs, this was nothing like the advertisement, he thought.

 The advertising campaign for  Paramedic-U-Like  was  dreamt up by the
highly profitable  Slimey,  Little,  and  Scumbag  Promotions  Ltd. It
featured lots of  cosmetically  enhanced  women  dancing  around a car
smash. Using pink lace parasols to  keep  the blood off their designer
swimwear. At which point,and  this  had  been  a  bit  of  a  coup for
messers Slimey, Little, and Scumbag,  that quizshow host that everyone
loved to cringe at, Smug  Git  bounded  onto  the  screen and told how
Paramedic-U-Like could save you  money,  and  if  your  child needed a
"Happy Cast(tm)" they could get a  free  Smug Git doll with detachable
limbs.

 Git was the ultimate game show host.  Over two meters tall, hair that
stayed steady as a rock and  cosmetically enhanced teeth for just that
right teeth catching the  light  effect.  Of  course  Git  was a BELF,
a custom job from the heart of the Life BELF manufacturing plant,a top
of the range model. Of  course  when  respectable gameshow hosts heard
that Twenty  First  Century  Box  Productions  was  having  their  top
game show host constructed, they threatened  to  strike. So Box warned
them they would be in breach of contract, thus many legal battles were
fought, and lost. It was here that  Box  came up with the greatest man
management  program  of  all  time.   All   the  trouble  makers  were
assassinated, and the entire thing  was blamed  on  some guy in a book
suppository.

Three hours later the Hearse-U-Like van pulled up outside the bar, and
two of the most  unlikely  characters  emerged  adorned with some even
more unlikely shirts. Shirts  that  would  make  even the most fashion
conscious of Hawaians feel inadequate. They  walked  into the bar, the
customer bell that wasn't on the door  didn't ring, they took one look
at Mostavo's now drained corpse  and  returned  to  the van to get the
Wash 'n' Suck floor cleaner and some  waders so that they could remove
Mostavo's remains without getting  blood  on  their  sandals. The Body
Disposal Experts threw the corpse into  the van which groaned a little
as if to say "Why couldn't I have worked for the post office?" The men
cleaned the blood off the floor, standard practice as blood banks were
vastly under stocked, and left without uttering a word. Once again the
bell didn't ring, as it wasn't there.  The bar was now empty so Malcom
closed for the night.
