Hi Chris!

Many  thanx  for  your letter,  the stuff and also the nice  review  of 
Undercover in issue 22 of your Maggie.

Because I'm very depressive at this time (winter and private  problems) 
I  will  not write a long letter but my motivation is  high  enough  to 
write some little lines to you...

Hum.  I was a bit irritated by your letter,  because we have released 2 
issues around Xmas: the regular issue 7 and a little Xmas-special (it's 
not  counted as regular issue).  Because you're writing about issue 7 I 
think  you haven't got the Xmas-special so far and so I've copied  this 
little  thing  for you.  Because you're writing that issue 7 is only  a 
preview  I must correct this,  because the shell is in the final state! 
We  have  kicked  the separation of a menu and  viewer  away  and  have 
decided to do a "hermaphrodite" because it isn't too much work for  us. 
I've  seen this sort of maggie on the Amiga and because many guys  have 
said  that UCM is a bloody rip-off of the DBA-Magazine we have  decided 
to bring a completely new shell to the Atari... So that's it.

The  shell  is very buggy this times,  it doesn't perfectly on VGA  and 
some  features  must be more improved.  I'm still in conversation  with 
Drizzt to rework the shell once more... I hope that the bugs are killed 
for issue 8. I don't know if you have found the hidden article in issue 
7...  Because  there  isn't standing a word about the present state  of 
.tnb. in the magazines I will tell you something about .tnb. in 1997...

At  first Drizzt (our last coder) would stop his work for  .tnb.  after 
releasing the Xmas-special-issue. He would dissolve .tnb. ... As I have 
heard  this  I  have contacted some of the other  "real"  members  (You 
should know that EX/ACT and FALLEN ANGEL were fantasy-members -> EX/ACT 
was the second pseudo of m.O.d.  and FALLEN ANGEL was the second one of 
me  ->  we wanted to confuse the scene with  this  second-pseudonyms... 
FLASH has never joined .tnb. - he was only a collaborating artist up to 
now... I don't know if he will join .tnb. someday.)

...  back to the story of .tnb.  reincarnation... Also, I had contacted 
FXL and Lot and we have decided to keep .tnb. alive, only just for fun. 
Because  we  had no coder FXL had said that we should  release  UCM  in 
HTML,  because he was able to create HTML-sides... Hum, a mad idea... I 
said  to Drizzt what we will do and he said that he will stay  also  in 
.tnb.  but inactive... Hm. As I said this to m.O.d. he leaves .tnb. and 
joined TSCC,  because he wouldn't waste his abilities for a lamer-group 
like  .tnb.  With  this problems we must stop all projects,  also LASSE 
REINBNG...  We  would  only  release new issues of  Undercover  in  the 
future... 

The state today is as follows:

Drizzt:-  
intern  active  since  some  weeks,  he is coding  again  and  he  will          
release  LASSE  REINBNG perhaps to the Siliconvention.  I  don't  know,          
but  he  said to me that he has created great routines  for  this  demo          
(on  ST...  I  will not talk about this,  because it's secret).  He will          
also  debug  the UCM-shell.  This time he can't do anything  for  .tnb.          
because  his  Falcon  is defect (NVRAM) ...  if the damage  is  to  big          
he will eventually buy again a Falcon ... or a PC :-(

I've  received  letters from Tat (today) and Tony Greenwood  (one  week 
ago) and I was very surprised about this! I will write back in the next 
days (I'm very limited in time - full-time-job sucks!)...

By the way,  Tat wrote to me that the scene(!) in UK is nearly dead and 
when I look the releases which were coming from UK I must say that he's 
right.  It's sad,  where are the times of POV, Ripped Off and TLB?! ... 
Today  there  are only some lame CD-groups left and this  one  stealing 
source-codes (esp. the ones of MSD of POV)... 

But  also  here  in Germany the scene is going down.  The  last  german 
members of the INDEPENDENT are on PC now (Absence, Avena and Inter) and 
only a few were left on the ST or Falcon. It's very sad... 

Ok, I'm looking forward to the release of Maggie 23.

Thanx  for  your  articles and the news!  This time I'm  writing  again 
nearly  alone on UCM 8.  The most people only send software to me and I 
must  test  it  by myself.  This sucks!  But your article is  a  little 
beginning  and I hope to get more from other guys.  Thanx also for  the 
news!

The  Donkey Island Game looks very promising and I'm looking forward to 
get  it!  I'm  a big friend of such adventures (Monkey  Island,  Maniac 
Mansion  and so one...) and over the last years there was no  stuff  of 
this kind released for the Atari computers... Hum... 

                            So stay cool and stay on Atari! 
                             
                               I hope to hear from you once more...

"...darkness  is  our only friend in the kingdom  of  decay..."  (Silke 
Bischoff) last message!

Okay  Eric,  by the time this issue gets to you,  I should have been in 
contact  again..  At time of writing this reply (Mid March),  I've just 
realised  that  I've  forgotten to send back the voting  form  for  the 
charts, so this will have to go in the next issue of Undercover..

With  reference  to the confusion about which issue  of  Undercover  we 
reviewed  in  Maggie  22,  yes we realise that we looked  at  the  Xmas 
special,  rather than the regular issue seven,  which was a much better 
read all round..

Donkey  Island preview,  Ed Cleveland has sent a copy to you  directly, 
and we hope it is the version that feels up to working on the  Falcon.. 
Still, that'll all sort itself out shortly..

We  look  forward  to  Undercover lssue 8,  when it is  out,  and  also 
anything  new  demo  related,  especially  Lasse  Reinbong   that  will 
hopefully emerge from the SiliConvention.. 

Anyway, we'll close this for now, see you around!

Chris H. (CiH)
