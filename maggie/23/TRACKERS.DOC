
                   NoiseTracker Special Things!
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Yeah, Yeah, Trackers are Dead, Trackers are S*iT, but they are nice!
 
 It's surprising how many people don't know what all the attributes 
 are for NoiseTracker/Protracker 2 (Kev!)...NOT Graoumf tracker it has 
 loads of different ones but it tells you inside the program, most 
 4/8 channel trackers are as helpful as a bear with a sore head waking 
 up during winter and just stung by a wasp!...which is why I'm writing 
 this out, so print it out and make your .MODs sound nicer.

 Tips...
 ~~~~~~~
 
  The difference between Vibrato and tremolo is marginal and it depends
 on the sample being used, try playing with the different waveforms...

 Protracker 2 on the Falcon030 DOES NOT like when you put a value over
 either 10 or 1F, I can't remember which but it goes really slow which
 it is supposed to and then say you change the speed back to F03, it
 is slower than normal i.e. that of F06, so I guess it must be a bug !

 As I type this in I was looking at all the ones I have never used, but
 some of them don't do anything!, well on the 030 version they don't, so
 I won't go into those now !!!!

 right, ok, that's it for today,
