First Sight: Mr. Pink
---------------------

"Pit your skills against earth invaders  from the 25th century! You'll
need all your  driving  skills  in  the  narrow,  twisting underground
tunnels of the subterranean network.  Destroy your enemies and advance
your speed to incredible levels.  Beat  the  clock and become the best
there is - S.T.U.N. Runner!"

The plots don't get any better then. STUN runner is basically a racing
game, with an element of shooting,  set  in  a series of tunnels. STUN
stands for  Sub-Terranean  Underground  network  (take  notes, acronym
fans) which sounds like a bit of  Tautology if I ever heard one. Which
reminds me of a rather  smart game (...snip! Anti-Falcon-Game-Ed). How
can you get a Sub-Terranean network that is not underground?

The name itself (STUN Runner)  is  obviously  just  a poor pun on "Gun
Runner". I am eagerly anticipating  the  sequel "Narcotic Smuggler" in
which you carry shipments of heroin  through the underground system in
Thailand, hoping to become the basis for a storyline in Brookside.

It is unusual in  the  fact  that  both  acceleration  and braking are
automatic. You can only accelerate by:

a) not hitting other cars/walls etc.
b) driving along the fastest bit of the track.
c) hitting booster pads on the track.

The best way to  decelerate  is  to  drive  into  the  back of another
vehicle.

You aren't racing against other craft,  you just have to complete each
section before the time  runs  down.  Obviously,  the more traffic you
hit, the more time you  lose  and  the  less  chance  you will have of
completing the section. The game  is  based  around avoiding the other
traffic, and this isn't very easy  when  you have no direct control of
braking and accelerating. So lets give it a run..

The first level is bizarrely  entitled  "cake-walk", although I saw no
evidence of  animated  foodstuffs.  This  is  really  just  a practice
session with a line of stars across  the track showing you the fastest
route you can take.

As you clamber aboard your  craft  a  female voice greets you "welcome
STUN runner". I thought the idea was  to BECOME the STUN runner. Never
Mind.

"And they're off"  (as  Murray  Walker  would  say).  Things zip along
nicely giving a good  impression  of  speed.  The inability to control
your speed means you  spend  the  entire  level  just tapping left and
right and you don't feel in  true  control  of your craft. In fact you
can just not touch the control  and  the craft will complete the level
by itself!

The next level introduces the concept of shooting at other craft which
is quite a satisfying experience. We  have booster pads which speed up
the  craft  no  end.  We  are   soon  faced  with  other  obstacles  -
indestructible drones (incredibly annoying) which  you can't shoot and
definitely can't drive through. Ramps which  hurl  you into the air so
you can attack flying baddies.  And  more  stars,  if you drive over a
certain number you get a smart bomb. Which is nice.

The game manual is one of  those dreadful poster things with appalling
artwork (whose idea were these? No wonder everyone stopped buying Lynx
games!) It does have one  redeeming  feature  though. In the "SCORING"
box is a list of points awarded for achieving certain goals, including
the infamous line "Destroy Purple  Mug  Cycle    75 points". I have no
idea what this means, but  the  idea  of  chasing purple mugs around a
series of tunnels sounds  a  lot  more  entertaining  than STUN Runner
itself.

Games like this depend totally on  the  control method, and I must say
that I wasn't  overly  enamoured  with  STUN  Runner's control system.
Steering was fiddly with a great  tendency  to oversteer. I suppose it
may be argued that it is a  game  that  needs a lot of skill. The game
itself is very difficult with time limits being very tight so a couple
of minor misjudgements and you are out of the game. You do fortunately
get a couple of continue credits.

The sound deserves a mention  only  because the "tunes" has absolutely
no idea of melody. The spot  fx  are  pretty standard with some muffle
samples adding a bit of atmosphere.

The graphics are poor, badly drawn but do shift about at a fair speed.

Overall we have a pretty average  game  which  fails to satisfy on all
counts. Not enough shooting to be  a  shoot  em up, not enough driving
controls to be a racing game. Perhaps  with  a lot of patience you may
get some enjoyment from this game, but I can't really recommend it. If
you are offered this  cart,  runner  away!  (appalling! You're sacked!
Jokes-Ed.)



Second Sight: RIPLEY
--------------------

S.T.U.N. Runner!  How dramatic it sounds,  sort  of as if it will STUN
you with the  amazing  quality  of  its  graphics/music/gameplay etc.,
sadly, the reality falls hugely  short.   S.T(oh  honestly, I can't be
bothered with all those  dots)UN  Runner  is  a  racing game, entirely
lacking any fellow  competitors,  you  compete  against  the clock and
believe me, the clock is mean.   If  you  bump into one rail too many,
get blocked by an armoured  drone  (which  is  all  too easy), or just
drive on the wrong  side  of  the  tunnel,  you  will not complete the
level.  Assuming, that is, you want  to  spend 21 seconds of your life
getting very bored.
     The music is  bog-standard,  unworthy  of  mentioning dross.  The
sound FX are poor in the extreme and  most of the voice samples are so
muffled you can't hear them.  The  only  clear sample goes as follows:
"YYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOWWWWWW!" and is crap.
     In true Cybermorph  style,  the  game  informs  you  of  all your
mistakes: "Stay off the rails",  you  barely  resist the urge to shout
"Oh bugger off you stupid, crap game."
     The gameplay comprises steering around  gentle bends and to avoid
clusters of indestructible drones,  as  well  as shooting destructible
drones, jumping on ramps, (remember  Eliminator  on  the ST?  Well, UN
Runner is perhaps a distant cousin, twice removed) not losing your way
in the mazes of the  Sub-Terranean  Underground Network and collecting
enough stars to give you: a Shockwave,  a  weapon a bit similar to the
Superzapper in Tempest 2000, but not as good.
     Just who drew the graphics is a particular question that troubled
me so I decided to investigate..  Hmm,  nothing  on the box, or on the
poster/instructions thingy.. much  searching  later  and  I  had still
failed to turn  up  any  names,  signatures  or  credits  (except from
William S. Sessions, Director, FBI and I  don't think even he can take
the blame for this).. The lack of  credits is a bit suspicious, but it
enables me to say, with a free conscience, that the graphics are crap.
The music is crap.  And the game is crap.
     'Winner's don't use drugs' it  says,  but  quite honestly after a
game of this, you feel in need  of  an injection of some sort, even if
it's only a caffeine one.
     S.T.U.N. Runner, all I can say  is  that you would be N.U.T.S. to
buy it.


The Verdict:               S.T.U.N. Runner
