                  TSCC 96ktro for the Siliconvention

This  effort  by The Sirius Cybernetics Corp,  whilst not on the  same 
scale as their epic 1995 Fried Bits entry,  still managed to win first 
place,  but not apparently first prize,  as one of the organisers more 
ghastly cock-ups got TSCC mixed up with TNB, and gave the latter group 
the main prize instead..

Still,  this  intro  is quite a bit shorter than the  'demo  cunningly 
packed  into  96k concept' that distinguished  'Terrorise  Your  Soul' 
from,  just about all 96ktros.. It is of a high quality with some very 
nice individual bits joining together to make a pleasing whole..

It starts quietly enough with a sweeping clock hand style screen  draw 
which  presents the stark and unambigious message the 'The end of  the 
world is nigh..' I'll share a secret with you all at this point..  The 
world  *never* ends before you have to hand in your homework,  and  it 
certainly  won't end,  whilst I've still got to knock out half a dozen 
assorted demo reviews for this issue of Maggie.. Still, we digress..

The first act consists of a nicely drawn and shaded solid 3-D  cuboid, 
more  of a block of stone which has had the corners and  edges  carved 
off,  and  looks  like a giant Foxes Glacier Mint,  albeit one that is 
gold coloured..  This spins around to the right,  and in the left part 
of  the screen is one of the famous unreadable logos..  This spins off 
to the bottom of the screen and out of sight to make way for the  next 
part,  which has a huge right to left scrolling logo/mural type thing, 
drawn a lot in the style of Flan of Exa..

We  then  get  a partial reprise of an effect touched on  in  the  TYS 
demo/96ktro, with a spinning fractal tree, which looks more benign and 
less prickly than the Avena demo effort, but is doomed to disappear in 
a puff of computer generated flame after but a very short time..

A  quick  burst  of  credits,  and  then  another  demo  standby,  the 
doughnut/torus  appearing  in the far distance,  and heading into  the 
foreground..  It is red and phong style shading.. Then it is swallowed 
up in the screen to make way for the final greetings..

These are acidy style swinging raster bars with a blur/fade effect, as 
the  various  crew and diskmag names are scrolled  onto  the  screen.. 
Hello  back!  by  the  way..  Then the brightness controls are  yanked 
upwards and the screen sears out into bright sunlight,  and apart from 
a pocket-sized version of the huge logo seen earlier as an end screen, 
that's it!

TECH VIEW by Tat: This 96Ktro is well, very 'TSCC' really. The design
is very  clean and reminiscent of  Amiga demos from a couple of years
back.  Best effect:  the nice wavy tree  (although the  lines are not 
depth-sorted, but it's hard to see this!) So very competent, a couple
of nice new ideas:  I just hope  TSCC release a  full  demo  sometime 
soon? How about it guys? (tat)

Ratings..

Graphics:-  89%  -  Handsomely  hand-drawn  graphics,  and  some  nice 
effects combined with these as well..

Sonix:- 80% - Nice and mellow if unmemorable tune..

Gee  Whiz:-  78%  -  Nothing massively new,  but what  was  there  was 
flawlessly done.. I liked the fancy 3-D object at the beginning..  

Overall:-  84% - A good effort,  a tiny bit short and over too quickly 
for my liking, but you can't complain too much really..
