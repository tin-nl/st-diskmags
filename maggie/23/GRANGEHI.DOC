                                  Or

      (The strange things that people did, and called it a game!)

We've found something even weirder than the Thompson Twins Adventure on 
the  Speccy  Sensations CD-ROM!  Yes,  even more out to lunch than  the 
Thompson  Twins,  and  ultimately more headbanging in frustration  than 
that limply side-splitting mid-eighties excursion into licenceware..

Yes at about the same time that the Thompson Twins game was hitting the 
casting  couch,  the producers of the popular school-soap Grange  Hill, 
decided  that  a  computer  game,  based on the  daily  trials  of  the 
troublesome soon-to-be-in-Eastenders teenage cast was in order, and the 
tills  would  be  alive with the sound of money  as  the  pubescent  TV 
audience  would be desperate to get their hands on any sort  of  Grange 
Hill memorabilia..

The  fact that 'Skool Daze' did the whole school thing so much  better, 
and  had  a revolutionary interface,  and AI system,  and kept multiple 
sprites going, and had a decent original plot, need not enter into this 
review..  The  game is typical Spectrum hand-me-down graphics,  not too 
badly drawn, certainly better than the Macsen 'Eastenders' game, with a 
large and conventional two dimensional view, facing the characters from 
the side..  Running Nemesis,  and loading the emulator,  we do notice a 
difference in pace,  and thankfully this game goes through the normally 
tedious loading and pre-game screens a lot quicker than otherwise would 
have been the case..

The plot,  such as it is,  consists of one of the characters, Zobbo, or 
Snotface, or perhaps Gitface, having his personal stereo confiscated in 
class.. It is after school, and he is talking to his mate, who due to a 
clerical error at the Stupid Nicknames Office, is also called Zobbo, or 
is it Blobbo?  Zobbo#1 tells Zobbo#2 that he is going to get his stereo 
back.. Zobbo#2/Blobbo points out rather too sensibly that the school is 
locked  up..  Zobbo#1,  fuelled  by equal measures of bravado and fear, 
says he will break in.. Zobbo#2, says words to the effect of "Wow, I've 
gotta see this!"

At  this  point,  the game commences..  I dab at some keys in hope,  my 
character  lurches off to the left,  only to fall into the clutches  of 
Zobbo's  mum  waiting  at home,  who immediately demands a  level  four 
diagnostic  check on the missing personal stereo..  Cripes,  I'm for it 
now! thinks Zobbo, and the game ends at this point..

A  second  attempt yields a menu system where you can  control  certain 
actions  on  behalf  of your character..  You are allowed  to  talk  to 
people, pick up, examine objects, etc, but there are no options to pick 
your characters nose,  or a menu bar that tells you to 'Have sneaky fag 
behind  bikesheds',  which  immediately drops several thousand  realism 
points from this already sinking game..

Trying  to have a conversation results in several minutes of  confusion 
from Zobbo#2, who is convinced you have had one magic mushroom too many 
with  your school dinner..  You are reduced to trying out random  ASCII 
characters,  as you can't seem to leave this bloody conversational menu 
mess,  which  still puts it miles above the normal dialogue you get  in 
the TV programme..

A  swift  reset  later  and another key takes you  to  the  right,  the 
direction that you,  and the game as a whole are supposed to be going.. 
Illusions  of progress are rudely shattered with your sudden  encounter 
with the latest and deadliest enemy to plague this game, a loose paving 
stone!!

Yes,  your character is deemed to have "died" at the point that he came 
into  contact  with  that  errant  paving  stone..   As  we  all  know, 
generations of schoolchildren have been carted off to the mortuary with 
large  holes  in their trousers,  and nasty grazes to the knee..  On  a 
personal note,  I only avoided premature burial when I was nine, by the 
smallest of margins, several times in fact..

Dismal licence,  poor premise,  weak plot, and things that go 'flibble' 
in the night..  It was all too much and I came out of the emulator, and 
back to Sanityville UK at some speed..

 *Conclusion*

What is brown and crusty often smells quite a bit as well..
