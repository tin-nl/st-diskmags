                         Author of Neurobotix

Name: Pieter van der Meer 
Age: 18 
Sex: yes, please! (It's a joke! Don't hit me!: male) 
Nationality: Dutch 
Birth date: September 7th 1978 

Early life: 
````````````
Do  you  mean  pre-Atari?  Oh,  boy...  Well,  I  was  born in a  small            
village and life sucked till I got an Atari.

What was your computing career pre-ST?
```````````````````````````````````````
Had an Atari 600 XL. Wasn't much fun, so I upgraded it a few times. Was 
more fun then, but not as much as the wonderful ST.

What made you take a fancy to things 16 bit and Atari?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Well, my dad had a 1040STf and it had splendid capacities. (Much better 
than  that XL thingie.) When my dad bought a PC for his business I  got 
his ST!!! Many days and nights of hard ST-addiction followed.

At what point did you decide to start programming for yourself?
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I had wanted to code much earlier, but had never had a good programming 
tutorial.  Those tutorials are really necesary(I hate that word!  Is it 
spelled right?  Nope, but it's too late - CiH). People should be helped 
to start coding.  Otherwise all computer users turn into lamers and PC-
slaves. 

But OK,  I started coding early 1994. I liked demo's and was interested 
in  how my computer worked.  It was the final frontier of knowledge you 
know!  I  also  saw that the big companies were deserting Atari  and  I 
wanted to make up for that a little.

Neurobotix was your first serious project, we understand that you were 
trying to do something else entirely, what happened there?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I  thought  I could become a wondercoder just like Doug Little  in  two 
months and code a Fractallandscape texturemapped thingie straight away. 
That was a big mistake.  It took me 6 months to learn assembly, because 
there  were  only a few good books about the language and  it's  pretty 
difficult  for a beginner.  The game I wanted to code required loads of 
3d-maths too and I had no idea how to include this in assembly code. 

Then  I  wanted to make a 2d-racing game,  but I lost  interest  pretty 
soon. This was pretty stupid. You should never give up even if you lose 
interest.  If  you  do  this  to often you will  never  release  a  big 
production.  Even if you lose interest,  consider this:  At least there 
are people that will like your production in the scene and will contact 
you. People that work for big companies never have this advantage. 

But  back to the question...  After this I just wanted to create a game 
that  I  could  like a bit more and wasn't as difficult  as  the  first 
project. That became Neurobotix.

Now  you've finished Neurobotix and released it,  do you think there is  
anything you could have done better, or just differently?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Mmmhh..  This might sound strange, but Neurobotix should have been much 
more  strategic  and mouse-controlled.  I wanted to make  a  cross-over 
between  a  violent  platformer  and  a  strategic  battle  game.   You 
controlled  your  robot  with  the mouse,  picking  up  scrapmetal  and 
upgrading yourself to form a better battle-robot. 

But  because I had problems with the mousecontrols and I  thought  that 
all  the  graphics  for the upgrades were to much work to  do.  So  the 
project changed to a more traditional platformer. 

Things  I  could have improved are:  background graphics,  adding a few 
more enemies and some more bonusses.  I didn't have the time anymore to 
do  this.  The  game  was already overdue when I  thought  about  these 
improvements.

Neurobotix was released as shareware, how is it doing at the moment?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
So far I've got 6 registrations.  Not so great. I hope to get some more 
in   the  next  few  months.   The  people  that  have  responded   are 
enthousiastic,  though.  Some  of  the nicest people I have ever known. 
Because  of  this  I will continue coding shareware.  Maybe I  need  to 
establish  my  name  a bit more.  I guess many people  registered  Jeff 
Minter productions because he is a cult person and people know that  he 
made great stuff.   (On the other hand, maybe my code-name is a bit too 
difficult, but it's part of me and I'm not giving it up.)

What other future projects are set to come from the hands of P. Van der  
Meer in the coming months, (Space to advertise as much as possible!)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
OK, here I go....

- Identifile. A TTP file analyser for all ST compatibles. It's already 
finished. I'll upload it to all big FTP sites soon. 

-  An  elite type of game.  Current title is "Solos".  This game has my 
main  interest and the highest priority.  Elite and Sci-fi fans  please 
contact me! I want your suggestions! (Will be Falcon only BTW) 

-  A 4k-tro for the SILIconvention.  It's already finished.  Release at 
the SILI. 

-  Loads other things are hanging around on my harddisk.  I can't  give 
any details, though. They are only in the beginning stages.

What do you think of the general Atari scene today?
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
More enthusiastical than ever.   I admit we lost some good people.  For 
instance: A good and nice coder I know (Hi, Jurgen!) has left Atari for 
the  PC.  He  never was a much scene guy.  He liked 3d and that sort of 
stuff  and  didn't care about much else.  He is a nice guy  that  never 
hesitates to help anyone. That's the downside of things. Eventually you 
lose people like this. 

On  the  upside  the  Atari folks are  getting  more  enthusiastic  and 
sometimes  are  even  starting to code to help the  scene.  People  are 
slowly beginning to realise that the PC is no fun. They are starting to 
see  that PC-users either are lamers or people who do nothing  creative 
or helpful all day. Now Atari users finally know what computing was, is 
and  will  be about.  It's about being creative with your  own  beloved 
machine and helping the scene out. 

It's  a pity that the ST-line died out.  But a new scene computer  will 
arise. (The phenix maybe?)

Is there anything that can be done to make it better?
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Yeah!  People  should  register programmes more often.  I admit that  I 
myself  have  only registered twice,  but I'm doing my third  one  this 
week!

Which person/organisation on the scene do you respect most of all?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Jeff Minter is the coolest person I've ever known in my life.  If there 
only there were more people like this.. <sigh> We would never have war, 
shopping  malls,  TV commercials and that sort of shit again.  We could 
all  develop  cool computers and use them to infinity.  We  could  code 
demo's  and games all day and design mega hardware.  we could have more 
diskmags than ever. AND hang Bill Gates!!!! 

...** ...   Snap out of it Pieter, the world is a piece of shit and the 
Atari scene is the closest thing to paradise there will ever be.  Well, 
I think you get the point.  MABN computer sales in Holland and Titan in 
England  are cool too.  At least they have some confidence in the Atari 
users.

Which person/organisation do you respect the least!!
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Bill Gates.  He partly made the computer industry into the heap of dung 
it  is  today.  It's  not only his fault,  most people are too lame  to 
understand  anyway  and  passively  caused  the  demise  of  the   cool 
computers.  Did you hear that when he dies,  he will give all his money 
to the third world!  Yeah right, the government and the system wouldn't 
allow  it in the first place and second of all if you want to help  you 
gotta show some initiative of your own. Not send large amounts of money 
without even knowing what is going to happen with it. 

I  hate  a  Dutch  guy called Dennis  Beute  too.  He's  an  obnoxious, 
irritating,  false  person.  Just  thinking about him makes me want  to 
puke.  I  should  have said that he was a lousy backstabbing,  twofaced 
son-of-a-bitch  long ago,  but I never had the nerve.  I'm not going to 
waste more space on this dumbass. That would spoil the interview.

How  do you think a machine like the Falcon compares with  the  current  
generation of PC's (whatever that might be at the moment!) 
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
It's obvious the Falcon cannot compare to the Pentium 133 Mhz  thingies 
of  today.  The  graphics  and sound of the Falcon are  cool,  but  the 
internal calculating\moving power isn't there.  On the other hand,  the 
Falcon is much more usable,  the software is better,  is easier to code 
on and doesn't require you to upgrade every 6 months.  So the Falcon is 
miles ahead and always will be. There you have it!

What  do  you  think of forthcoming new technologies,  the New  PC  3-D  
graphics  cards,  the Sony 'Yaroze' Playstation kit,  the Centek Falcon  
clone?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Fuck  PC  ('nuff said)(we all know how crappy this thing  is!),  3d  is 
nice,  but the standard on the PC isn't set yet,  so you need to code 5 
3d-drivers,  which  is  just  as difficult as coding your  own  polygon 
routines. Those things will be outdated soon, anyway. 

The yakozee-bubblebath thing? Fuck playstation. Need a add-on PC. Nuff' 
said already! 

Centek  Phenix:  Looks  promising,  I  only  hope the company  has  the 
financial  power  to  market it.  Those PC-like components  bother  me, 
though.  If  it  becomes a modular system,  you will have compatibility 
errors  all  over  the place and it will be  much  more  difficult  for 
coders.

What do you think you will be doing to celebrate the year 2000!
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Getting drunk to celebrate the completion of my latest demo?

Some words to react to....
```````````````````````````
Atari.. 
Stay cool, stay Atari. Or: "keep it channel Atari"
 
Amiga.. 
Just  to  annoy you hypocrite hardcore Amiga users:  Oh,  dear..  Saying 
you'll  never  own another machine besides the Amiga,  and two  minutes 
later  laming  around behind a PC.  I have met some nice amiga  owners. 
(No, honestly!) But those guys were also PC-owners.

Bill Gates 
Have you got two hours to spare?
 
ST News.. 
Never read it,  but Rich K. is certainly a nice guy. I mailed him a few 
times and he seems really nice. Boy can this guy write long letters!

Censorship.. 
Parents  should warn and guide their children.  The only way is to  let 
kids know SLOWLY in what kind of world they live in. 
(What the hell am I writing..? I've always hated education!) 

The  media should sod off with all the nonsense and start showing  more 
useful  stuff + stuff that people can actually laugh about  instead  of 
the American social/business/crap type of humour like in Friends.

Red Dwarf (BBC tele series) 
Cool! Don't always have time to watch. Can remember a cool episode with 
"ThE JuStiCe ZoNe".

The X-Files 
Nice, but becomes boring after a while. Star Trek rules supremely!

Finally, any special message for our readers from yourself?? 
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- What do want to see in my new Space game for the Falcon! Contact me! 
-  Front242  rules!  Any  fans out there?  (This is a band  that  makes 
electronic  music for everybody that doesn't know.

Thanks for your time, may it all go brilliantly in the future..

 - Chris -

OK, bye! And may the the Atarians live long and prosperous!
