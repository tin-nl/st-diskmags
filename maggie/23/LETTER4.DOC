Now  this  is based on parts of a letter the man himself  sent  to 
me..  Most  of the content is fairly personal to me,  and has been 
edited away..  However, there are some bedburningly funny extracts 
that are really crying out to be shared with the world at  large.. 
I hope Jody doesn't mind,  but here we go for the first episode of 
the JODY SMITH FILES!  

 CiH, 13.4.97


        It was only this morning that  I  received a letter from you -
well, a disk anyway - with that  thar Donkey Island demo on it.  Waddy
marvelous it was too.  I  was  well  impressed.  Aren't those graphics
big and lovely, eh?  I  thought  so.   So reminiscent of lost eighties
classic-to-be Dick Special, too (read Where  Are  They Now? D - F, ST+
issue 10, if you don't know what I'm on about).  Bloody funny, too.

        Tell me, did that Ed Cleveland  bloke  do all the graphics, as
well as program it?  Surely he  couldn't (cue shite Airplane joke: "He
did do all the graphics and programming, but don't call me Shirley")?

        Clever bloke.

        I used to know a  guy  called  Ben Cleveland, you know.  Right
fat bastard he was, too...

 POLITICAL MAGGIE BITS....... NOW!

        As a special, fruity treat  I  have  lent  a hand to your fine
Election Maggie Spesh in the form of an awesome, awestruck Blue Monkey
Phoney Phone-In Mega-Trip Special where  I  ring up a local politician
and wind them up to the  brink  of destruction!  Yes!  Really!  A real
Member of Parliament!

        Okay, so I  haven't  actually  done  it  yet,  but  the  MP in
question is targetted in my  phonic  sights  and  will  get a rare ol'
bashing soon.  I promise.   It  will  be  great.   It will be genuine.
Consider it done, because by the time you read this, it will be.

        One thing though, if the whole  Blue  Monkey thing is to work,
readers will have to see old  Blue  in  question,  so I will include a
picture of Blue Monkey for you  to  pack  and include in the article's
'Show Pic' bit.  Please, I know it  takes  up a lot of memory, but the
picture must be present for the idea to work.

        When I have  done  the  phoning  and  typed  up  the resulting
account, I will be sure to  come  back  to this document and tick this
box, to let you know:
                          /
                      [  /]      Done it!
                      [\/ ]      And the results were excellent!

 Stardate entry: 25/03/97.

        Yes, It's my second shift on this huge son of a novel, that IS
my letter to you, from the heart.  Well, my fingers anyway.

        Now that I've  done  the  brill  Phoney,  I  hope  you'll draw
attention to it in  your  editorial,  please,  or  at least somewhere,
because a lot of work went  into  it  and  it took an extremely direct
root to the comical rousing of politics.  Thanks and enjoy.

        It's actually Saturday night,  tonight,  and  I'm all at home,
alone and dull.  I should be  out  partying, or something, but after I
drank to the point when your memory stops recording things last night,
I can't actually remember where that thirty  quid went to, that I took
out for a trawl around pubs with me mates.  Yeah, a lot of it probably
did go towards buying the  bloody  slushy  stuff  that left me in that
state, but surely not all of it.

        Still, I woke up in my  own  bed this morning (alone), so last
night couldn't have been so great afteral.

        Broke, 10:17pm and what have I spent the last few hours doing?
Reading Maggie back issues, of course.

        I read issue 19 (the  one  with  the  crap picture of a ghosty
bloke going through a  wall)  and  the  extensive  hotel  + flat based
articles on Maggie's fifth birthday.   I  had skipped them before, but
god are they groovy!  I find  it  hard  to believe that I actually sat
and read 100 pages  of  report,  but  those  articles really were pure
entertainment in the making.

        This 'real-time article' lark is  pretty  damn fine and worked
as well as a workman who really likes working.  At work.

        I hope you plan to do  more  of  these at other Maggie parties
you will be planning, eh?  Just thought I'd issue my support.

        Out of interest, to see exactly what I was doing on the day of
that there event, I pulled my 1995 diary off the bookshelf and flicked
through to that precise Sunday in August.  Here's what my entry said:

       "Sunday, 20th August, 1995.
        I went to Mars, picked Daisys, came back, ate some ancient
        statues of Greek Gods, then went to bed.  A lie.  Nothing
        much is happening, we've got a new fridge, the wife's still
        on holiday in Wales, the cow's still not sent me a postcard
        and I fancy a pint of John Smith Draught Bitter.  Or Guiness.
        Or Carling Black Label.  Or Cider.  Or Egg Nog.  Noooooo, not
        Egg Nog.  Anything but Egg Nog.  Ooooh, an Egg Noggy Noggy,
        an Egg Noggy, Noggy-Noggy."

Christ.  Was I nuts, or something?  What  the hell was that all about?
What had I taken  that  day?   The  day  after  I  wrote about my mate
failing his driving test and proclaiming  "It's  a sham, Jody.  I just
can't go on.  I've got a car, I've  got  some petrol to put in it, but
without that green paper I'm as good  as a stiff."  Which isn't nearly
as weird, is it?  Is it???

        Just thought I'd share that with you.

        Oh, and this time when you write to me, answer me this:
        Backups?  Backups?  We don't *NEED* no steenking backups.

                                                  '
                                              Where DID it come from?

                            ---------

- Ed Note - 

That  is  a godamned good question to ask..   It is some  computer 
persons  attempt  to be clever with the phrase "Badges,  we  don't 
need  no  steenking badges!",  which originated from  some  comedy 
western  or other.. 

It'll  only be a couple of days after this issue hits the  streets 
that  some saddo film buff will tell us which film it  came  from, 
the  actor  who  uttered  the  phrase,  minor  stuff  like  camera 
positions and so on, and the directors favourite choice of scoobie 
snack he was indulging in after that vital scene was filmed..

Another interesting place  where a version of this phrase  cropped 
up  was at the April 1996 Hamburg Symposium coding party  where  I 
uttered  the  phrase  "Mornings,  we  don't  *need*  no  steenking 
mornings!"  in  the  so far unseen  Diskbusters  diskmag  realtime 
article  from the party.  ('Uttered' in the sense of typing  stuff 
into someones computer for future ccnsumption by text freaks.)  It 
was  rather early in the day,  and not a lot of sleep was had from 
the night before..  Felice,  in a fit of  unecessary embellishment 
added  underneath "Cars,  we don't need no steenking cars!"  which 
was another quote from some film or other..

So now you know, I bet you wish you'd left the subject well alone!

                            ----------

        Hmmm, I saw a clip of Stars In Their Eyes a little while back.
That show is criminal, it really is.  You can always bet that each and
every series at some point will  spawn  the same old crap incarnations
of Elton John, Mark Almond and Freddy Mercury that it always does.

        A half-decent Bjork was  on  there  tonight,  as was a Michael
Ball-a-like, wearing  quite  posibly  the  most  entertaining  wig  in
history, balancing in the greatest seat in  the  house - on top of the
boy's head.

        It didn't appear that the  kid  had  ever shaved before in his
life either and  looked  quite  miffed  that  the  backstage peeps had
shaved that stark and skanky bum-fluff off.  "Didn't even want to come
here," he told ashamed beard, Mathew  Kelly.   "Grandad made me do it,
humph."

        Listening to Radio 1 around this time is really quite amusing,
you know.  It's that  Westwood  bloke,  doing  the  rap show with some
large black geezer who says things like: "Radio One rap show - TO MISS
IS TO DIS!"  And other such weird stuff, with a heavy echo on it.

        Best of all though, is when people ring in every half hour and
'bigup' their mates.  A minute ago a  major Norfolk guy, with the most
hilarious farmers accent  you  could  ever  hear  'phoned  in and said
something along the lines of:  "Allo  ray-dee-ooh  warn.  I'ed loik to
bigup all moi frarnds an'  darncin'  crew  posse in Naaaaridge and soi
the girls is marsive.  'ankyou."

        Mr. Big Black Geezer was quite  baffled.  God I'd love to wind
'em up, but I reckon it's all censored.  Shame.

        Anyway, it's 11pm  now  and  as  the  clocks  are  taking that
elaborate bungee jump forward an  hour  at midnight tonight, giving me
even less time in bed, I shall soon  have to retire (to an old peoples
home, somewhere in Somerset, wearing  a  tweed  suit, smelling of wee,
crapping myself whenever I laugh, ectetera) to bed.

        Byeeeeeeeee!

         Jody 'I've got to change that blasted surname' Smith
