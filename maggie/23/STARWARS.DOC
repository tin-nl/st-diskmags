               a long, long time ago, in a decade far,
              far away, cinematic history was made by a
           pubescent farmboy, an eight foot teddy-bear and
          an electronic swingbin with a midget inside.  Star
       Wars captivated a generation, made Darth Vader a house-
    hold name and sold a million plastic Millenium Falcons in the
  process.    Now, with a new set in production and the refurbished
originals in the cinema, the Empire cracks it's knuckles and prepares
                          to strike again...


Star Wars.  The biggest thing on  the  planet today, set on some other
planets in space and of course all clocking from a long long time ago,
in a galaxy quite some distance  from  here.   It was twenty years ago
when Star Wars first graced the  big screen, amassing $513 and opening
the floodgates for a trilogy that would  go on to gross $1.3 billion -
twice the national debt  of  the  Bahamas,  today!   It spawned enough
plastic toys to create an  ecological disaster, provided Ronald Reagan
with a name for a stratospheric Strategic Defence Initiate that proved
faker than Chewie's hair piece (and was sued by Lucas for name rights)
and managed to guarantee nearly  all  starring  actors with their last
big film role ever.

        And then, nothing.

        The doors of LucasArts  shut  with  an almighty clang.  George
Lucas and his cronies  set  to  work  on  less imaginative, but equaly
lucrative tasks, such  as  the  creation  of  cinema's sensurround THX
system (named after Lucas's first ever film as director, THX 1138).

        Occasionally, the odd  book,  cartoon,  comic  or poster would
out-run the hounds and escape Lucas House, strolling the outside world
to soak up royalty cheques and keep  the  myth alive, but of the other
two trilogies Lucas had promised, there was not a word.

        Star Wars fanatics grew hungry, and after collecting the books
and the comics of the books and the posters of the comics of the books
and the toys of the posters of the comics of the books of the original
films that spawned it all,  the  fans  slowly  wittled away to the odd
few, clenching  all  what  was  left  of  the  great  trilogy  - their
memories.  Twenty years on  and  things  are  already changing.  Storm
Trooper figures  are  being  dusted  down  again,  with  people  being
prepared to fork out an  extrodinary  amount  of  cash for an original
Jabba The Hutt (with matching  slave).   Even  the new toys are barely
touching the shelves.

        "We've been selling Star Wars merchandise ever since the first
film in 1977," says Dick Jude,  store manager of London's comic/sci-fi
Mecca, Forbidden Planet.  "The mere thought  that the films are seeing
a re-release has reactivated all the hype.   Anything new we get in is
snapped up immediatley, though it's toys  for  boys.  Most of the guys
who buy the stuff will never take the toy out of the box, but will put
it away somewhere for future value.  The real teaser behind it are the
new films being shot now."

        Following Return Of The Jedi - the  last film in the trilogy -
little rumours have grown stronger, met  up  with more rumours, bred a
whole family of bigger rumours  and  are  now finally confirmed.  With
the re-released Star Wars accumulating  over [dolar]439 million in the
states, this September it is all too  well known that the boy Lucas is
at it again,  shooting  the  three  Star  Wars  prequels  at Leavesden
Studios, Hertfordshire, for release between 1999 and 2003.

        Surprising to think really, that such  a history has become of
a film  that  was  slated  by  critics  upon  release  (shunned  as  a
"simplistic game  of  Space  Invaders")  and  hated  by  Lucas' fellow
directors.  George Lucas was one  of  several young American directors
that made up Hollywood's 'brat pack' of  the late seventies and it was
at an early, private screening of  Star  Wars  at Lucas' home, when he
found out who his  friends  really  were.   Assembled at the screening
were American Graffiti writers,  Gloria  Katz  and Willard Huyck, John
Milius, Matt Robbins, Brian De Palma and Steven Spielberg, to name but
seven.  Out of all the up  and  coming Hollywood hotshots, it was only
Speilberg who resisted dubbing Star Wars a disasterous attempt at film
making, when he told Lucas in  a restaurant afterwards:  "George, it's
gonna make a million."  Perhaps this  goes  to  show the two minds who
understood the film industry more than any other.

           "Aren't you a little short for a Stormtrooper?"

        But what makes the whole  yarn  so  special?  It's simple good
versus evil.  A kind of Jack  And  The Beanstalk with Ewoks, or should
it be that Star Wars is  a  spin  on  the  myth of King Arthur and the
(Jedi) knights of the round table?  Probably not.

        Star Wars took it's original  inspiration  from the 1958 Akira
Kurosawa flick, The Hidden Fortress, it is now known.  Kurosawa, who's
previous work,  Seven  Samurai  later  became  Hollywood's Magnificent
Seven, set the story of a great  lord who's army had been defeated and
land concurred, yet still managed to  help  his only daughter flee the
domain, to escape to a distant land where she would remain safe, hotly
persued by the hostile concourers.  Along  the way, the girl is helped
by  two  bickering  peasants,  bearing   more   than  just  a  passing
resemblance to R2D2 and C-3PO.

        Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odessey had given a flavour of
what life in space could be  about,  with lots of people waiting about
in slowly spinning  space  stations,  as  classical  music blared away
across  the  galaxy.   Boycotting  the   idea  of  a  sedate  universe
altogether and plumping for a bit  more  action, Lucas created a whole
new hive of activity, set in a new world that had far outstretched the
minds of even a fully drugged  up  seventies child, with it's Wookies,
Jawas and giant frog-eating, pot-smoking slug ambassadors.

        It's not surprising then, that  a recent Family Fortunes-esque
poll  in  The  Face  magazine  revealed  that  the  most  recognisable
celebrity of 1996 was not The Prodigy's Keith Flint, Liam Galagher, or
even Paddy Ashdown  for  that  matter,  but  was  infact the automated
wheely bin that is R2D2.  It  makes  sense  that the Satr Wars myth is
kept alive on screen by those not  only paying homage, but also paying
huge amounts of cash for the approval - Pepsi being one, forking out 2
billion dollars to use  characters  from  the  trilogy  up until 1999.
Other than that, Darth  Vader  has  recently  taken timeout to promote
Tunes on TV advertisements, while  even  The Bounty Hunter has cameoed
on the cover of  Mo'  Wax's  'Dusted'  flyer  and  on  The Ministry Of
Sound's brilliantly holographic 'Dance Wars' compilation.

        What next?  Chewbacca's All  Over  Salon Selectives?  Princess
Leia's hair-do crossants?  Jabba The Hutt's, erm, huts?

        With the mass marketing appeal that  Star Wars has, Lucas will
find it hard to resist keeping  to  the same 'hush-hush' policies that
were deployed during production of the previous films, as the money to
be generated by those wanting a slice of Lucas' new trilogy to promote
their product is  likely  to  overcome  the  final  box office intake,
anyway.

        "When some people went to a bank or a school, we went to
        the Deathstar, or the Millenium Falcon, and of course
        it becomes a job just like any other, strange to say."
                                               Anthony Daniels, C-3PO.

        This  September,  shooting   begins   at   Leavesden  Studios,
Hertfordshire, on the three new  Star  Wars  films for release between
1999 and 2003.  The films are  to  be  prequels in the sense that they
happened 40 years before the existing  three, charting the progress of
Obi Wan Kenobi, young Anakin  Skywalker  (later  to become a Mr Vader)
and other such Jedi namesakes.

        When George Lucas originally scripted The Star Wars (as it was
first known), he envisaged a wide-ranging  story of three acts, broken
up into three chapters each.  That is why Star Wars, Episode IV: A New
Hope (it's full name) is so, acting as  the forth in a series of nine.
Lucas made the decision to film the middle three first, as they seemed
the most commercially viable.  In 2003 when  the final part of the new
trilogy hits  cinema  houses  across  the  globe,  then  what?   We'll
probably see  the  last  three.   Hopefully  not  twenty  years later,
though.

        With so much interest in  Star  Wars -  even more so in recent
years - keeping the new films under wraps is going to be quite a task.
Originally, the crew filming Return Of  The Jedi wore jackets emblazed
with the name Blue Harvest  to  throw  snoopers  off, while during the
filming of The Empire Strikes Back,  Lucas had Dave Prowse announce to
Luke, as Darth Vader, "Obi Wan is  your father", dubbing in "I am your
father" later on.

        "Someone was letting  out  information  and  being the British
one, they all thought it was  me,"  explains Dave Prowse, still bitter
from having his voice totally dubbed  over  in the films by James Earl
Jones deepened brogue, not  knowingly  until  he  had  sat down at the
original premiere.  "They gave me  false  lines throughout filming.  I
didn't even know I'd chopped  Luke's  hand  off  until I saw it months
later."

        Lucas' liking  for  dubbing  was  extreme.   Not  satisfied at
dubbing all of Darth Vader's dialogue,  he also hated Anthony Daniel's
vocal performance as C-3PO, wanting to replace the camp, British voice
with a calm-talking American drawl.  It  wasn't until the film reached
a rough-cut stage did  he  realise  how  effective the spoken dialouge
was.

        "At one point at  the  premiere,  I  thought  I was blown up."
Explains Denis Lawson, X-Wing pilot Red  Two,  or Wedge if you prefer.
"I thought 'Ah, now what, that's me  gone  - no space to appear in the
sequels for me' and then, about 2  minutes later, Bam!  I came back on
the screen again.  'My God!   I'm  still  there!   I'm still there!' I
remember thinking.  It shows you how little we knew."

        "I didn't think it was going to be much good at all,
        really, but then I thought 'well, there must be something
        in it if Alec Guiness is in the movie.'"
                                                   Kenny Baker, R2-D2.

        Casting rumours have been awkward for the new films, obviously
made up  by  uninventive  idiots  in  ways  of  thinking.   Stories of
Macaulay Culkin appearing as a young  Luke Skywalker have been shunned
by LucasFilm, as have thoughts of  Kenneth Branagh starring as a young
Obi Wan, leading to the  abysmal  headline:  "Branagh To Be Pint Sized
Guiness In New Star Wars Films."   Lucas  soon stated, "I've never met
or talked to him.  The British tabloids made that up."  Spot on.

        Ewan McGregor was also rumoured  to  be playing a certain lead
role in the new films, of which LucasFilm would not comment.  Oooh...

        Final drafts of  the  scripts  (of  which  there  are several,
though the original Star  Wars  pictures  had  just three whole sripts
produced each, to avoid leakage) fron  the  new films suggest that the
movies will be almost entirley computer generated, like Toy Story - in
which the company also had a hand.   Lucas will be seated in Directors
Chair for the  first  of  the  films  and  Mr  Producer  will  be Rick
McCallum, he of Strapless and  Radioland  Murders fame.  The Rocketeer
director, Joe Johnston, will be on hand to direct the other two.

        Despite the copious amounts of computer animation, real living
and breathing actors will still be used in the new filming.  LucasFilm
have issued such charecter appeals as this to casting agencies:

DELIVERED AUG 1 1995  GEORGE  LUCAS'S  "STAR  WARS" UNTITLED STAR WARS
TRILOGY PREQUEL  FEATURE  FILM.   PLEASE  NOTE  THIS  IS  A NATIONWIDE
SEARCH.  ANAKIN SKYWALKER (DARTH VADER):
Caucasian, 8-9, Anakin  is  a  handsome  young  boy with extraordinary
charm.  He has a vulnerability  and  earnestness that make him totally
disarming.  His amazing apitude  for  things  mechanical together with
his quick wit and physical  fitness  make  him  a  natural pilot at an
early age...  Anakin is a  role  model  of  the highest order, someone
every boy would like to be...

        A role every  living  actor  worth  their  pay  packet will be
fighting over?  Well, if you  look  at  what  happened to the original
cast, I doubt if any up and coming actor would want to touch it with a
plastic Light Sabre...

        Other than Harrison Ford,  who  later  appeared in the Indiana
Jones trilogy, Blade Runner, Witness,  The  Fugitive and even E.T. had
Spielberg not  'done  the  Lucas'  and  cut  his  scenes  as  a school
principal out, Star  Wars  proved  the  final  word  in  most  of it's
starring actors CV's.

        Wither Mark Hamill,  of  Luke  Skywalker  casting, leaving his
Jedi cloke to star  as  The  Elephant  Man  in  the theatre.  The show
itself proved a massive success, causing  Hamill to state that theatre
was to be his home from now on,  turned down film roles left right and
centre.  It was only shortly after,  when interest in his shows waned,
that his Elephant Man success was  put  down  to hungry Star Wars fans
flocking to see Skywalker gone ugly.

        Hamill recently  put  his  face  to  FMV  clips  in  The  Wing
Commander series of games, as well as providing both the voice for The
Joker and Robin, in cartoon Batman.

        Carrie Fisher, after her  Leia  Organa  experience, moved from
Hollywood onto  seriously  hard  drugs.   Rehab  prevailed, eventually
leading Fisher to appear in such  major  box office stormers as Hannah
And Her Sisters, When Harry Met Sally  and even The Blue Brothers.  In
the end, Fisher recovered in true Hollywood  style, to write a book of
her accounts in the  gutter,  entitled  Surrender  The  Pink which, to
complete the circle, was made into a film, Postcards From The Edge.

        In spite of all this, Carrie  Fisher, it seems, is very likely
to cameo in one of the new  films,  which she talked to press about in
an extemely excited fashion.  Until  then,  following in the footsteps
of many an other  defunct  US  film  star  by  appearing  in their own
sitcom, Fisher is set to take over Jennifer Saunders' role as Edina in
the American version of Absolutely Fabuolous, strange though it is.

        In the meantime,  Alec  Guiness  has  starred  most notably in
Smiley's People, recieved a  knighthood  of  the  non-Jedi variety and
celebrated his eighty third birthday, refusing  to  star in any of the
new films, claiming that he only  appeared  in the first films for the
money.

        Elsewhere, General Moff Tarkin,  aka  Peter  Cushing has died,
while Kenny 'R2D2' Baker starred  in  Time Bandits and Willow, Anthony
'C-3PO' Daniels returned to the theatre and unmasked Darth Vader, Dave
Prowse, still claims his greatest triumph  was playing the Green Cross
Code giant.  Okay.

        "Acting in this movie I felt like a raisin in a giant
        fruit salad.  And I didn't even know who the cantaloupes
        were."
                                          Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker.

        In the period  leading  up  to  the  prequels,  the Lucas hype
machine is set into  hyperdrive,  as  it  were,  with blatant cash-ins
cropping up everywhere.  Forget the toys,  the comics and the posters.
Kids of today - whether  young,  or  of  the  adult variety - want new
generation merchandise to fit in with their new generation lifestyles.
Star Wars work-in-progress  CD  Roms  are  out  for  PCs,  as  well as
computer games Dark Forces, X-Wing amd Rebel Assault One and Two.  Who
makes them?  LucasArts, dammit.   Lucas  hasn't  spent the past twenty
years watching daytime television  and  thinking  of  space.  No, he's
been developing his computer  games  division  and  thinking of space,
milking Star Wars for all the public can take.  And if recent interest
has been anything to go by,  they  can  take  a  lot more of that Jedi
juice as yet.

        So, as the dust settles on the Tattooine plains and the little
Ewoks snuggle up  in  bed  in  preperation  for  a  hard days shooting
somewhere just north of London the next  day and with the new films in
production and the old ones on  the  big  screen once again, Star Wars
truly is back in force.

        Though for many, Star  Wars  is  not  coming  back  - it never
really went away.
