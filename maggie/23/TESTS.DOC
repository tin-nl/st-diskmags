
             Now let's answer the most interesting question:

                 How fast runs a Falcon with 68040 CPU ?
                 =======================================

                  Please remember that my Falcon worked 
                      at 32 Mhz 030 + 68882 before!

Alls Tests were done on a Falcon030 in BigTower + Afterburner040 (64 Mhz)
+ internal FPU + 50 Mhz DSP + 4 Mbyte ST-RAM + 32 Mbyte FastRAM
+ new keyboard "Cherry G80". NVDI-4 in FastRAM.


Test 1: Calculate a picture with NeoN Grafix 3D. It was calculated with
------  160 x 120 in Falcon True Color. All possible preferences were
        used: shadow, mirror, transparency, display on.
        SAVE was disabled. Calculated using Z-buffer.

        68030 (32 Mhz) + FPU = 17,40 minutes
        68040 (64 Mhz) + FPU =  1,77 minutes

Test 2: The same test as before, but using raytracing instead of Z-buffer.
------
        68030 (32 Mhz) + FPU = 21,13 minutes
