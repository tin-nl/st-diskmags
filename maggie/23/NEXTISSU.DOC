
                          For a Future Issue

                    What is what for the next time?

Have a heart people, we've still got a lot on to get this current issue 
out of the way!!

Still,  next time up,  new games coming up, such 'newies' as the latest 
game from the Reservoir Gods 'Republic', a bit more of the best of what 
is seen at the Atari Show, Tony Greenwood's forthcoming releases, the 4 
meg remix of 'Hero',  the new Tempest style game,  the final release of 
Donkey Island, and more..

Demos, we catch up with the remaining Siliconvention releases, and look 
forward  to new demos by Dead Hackers Society and Inter among  others.. 
There may even be a megademo resurrection for the ST, if the mysterious 
ST Knights are to be believed, and what will the Polish scene get up to 
next?? Keep an eye out during the summer months!

Another  area of promise that we are exploring is the mysterious  world 
of the Jaguar Server project.. Twenty-five to thirty people are working 
on  their own homebrew Jag development kits,  and work is well advanced 
on all sorts of things.. Get the lowdown on this next time!

We've  still  yet to carry out a full review of  Grauomf  Tracker,  the 
thirty-two  channel  monster soundtracker,  which has had to  be  back-
burnered  with our attention devoted fully to Nemesis for this  issue.. 
There  is also the small matter of an interview with the author,  which 
seems to have been missed off this time around as well..

Probably also, an updated Diskmag encyclopaedia..

Apart from that, dunno really!
