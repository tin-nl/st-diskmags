
                        A interview with MW-Elektronik

                           about the Afterburner040
                                 
                          done 1996 by Markus Binder
                          (before I bought the 040)



question: Is it possible so switch back to the original 68030 CPU with a
          Afterburner040 Falcon?

MW      : Yes and no. We know someone who made it possible to switch back
          to the 68030 for his own Falcon. We don't know if this works
          correctly. It may be possible, but the more important thing is:
          The producer of the Afterburner - they have the rights about it -
          don't want to allow the option to switch back.

question: But I think this would be very important for a Falcon user who
          want's to get the 040. Now I have first to think about which 
          programs may be working on the 040.

          Now I would like to know how important the FastRAM for the 040
          Falcon is. I personally think it's only expensive.

MW      : 32 Megabyte FastRAM cost 300 DM. That's not too much money.
          Remember that the FastRAM has 14 times the performance than
          the old ST-RAM. In standard applications you get normally
          8 times the performance. If you're working with big pictures
          the FastRAM is very useful.

question: How much FastRAM can I use with the Afterburner?

MW      : Well, if you're a user of MagiC 4, the maximum FastRAM is
          32 Megabyte. Without MagiC you're able to use up to 128
          Megabytes. For MagiC 4 we've a special program to install
          into the auto folder.

question: How many programs are still working on the 68040?

MW      : There're some programs wich have problems, but most PRGs
          are working correctly. We were also able to run some games.

question: Is the DSP still working with Afterburner040? I have got
          a Eagle Sonic 32 Mhz 030 speeder at the moment and this
          has its problems with DSP and FPU.

MW      : Yes, the DSP is working. Some DSP programs had its problems
          because the CPU was faster than the DSP. In fact of this we
          increased the DSP to 50 Mhz, and now there're no longer
          problems with DSP-use.

question: Please tell me something about the internal FPU of the 68040.
          Is the internal FPU automatically used by the 040?

MW      : The internal FPU is used by programs wich need a old 68881/2
          FPU. Other programs don't use the internal FPU. You need
          the AB40_FPU.PRG to use the internal FPU.
