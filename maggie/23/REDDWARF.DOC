                    Some opinions ventured by CiH..

Well  we've  waited  long enough for it,  and it seems that  when  that 
Friday  night  9,00  o'clock moment arrives,  we still have to  wait  a 
little bit longer as the previous programme stubbornly clings on to its 
remaining airtime, refusing to let go..

Yes, it's 'Gardeners World', with Alan bloody rattle on for hours about 
herbacious borders Titchmarsh, whose beaming face is still staring back 
at  you  out of the box,  when all the other channels have  moved  onto 
their 9.00pm slots,  and are tapping their feet impatiently waiting for 
Beeb 2 to catch up..

I've  never understood this need for programme controllers to  put  the 
most  boring  and  the most amusing tele programmes  together  back  to 
back..  Gardeners World is strictly Sunday night fodder,  and should be 
keeping  'Songs of Praise' and 'Antiques Roadshow' company  along  with 
the other national tranquilisers, sorry, I meant institutions.. Why not 
precede  Red Dwarf with a fairly amusing comedy,  and then hit us  with 
the big one,  when we're nicely warmed up.. It's this haphazard lack of 
thinking  that is letting terrestrial television gently down  into  the 
gutter..

Mind  you,  Sky (Satellite) would probably have some cheesy comic  book 
effort such as 'Zena,  Skimpy Leather Thonged Warrior Queen' on at this 
time instead...

Hang on though, this is turning unintentionally into a generalised rant 
against  piss-poor TV,  and we came to praise some of the good  stuff.. 

Let us now do so without further delay!

                 ------------------------------------
I'm  going to be controversial and defy TV critic wisdom to say that  I 
quite liked the new series!!  There,  I said it, now what are you going 
to  do  about it..  I'm frankly amazed by those critics who  say  "What 
about  the good old cozy old set up of three guys and a  droid  chasing 
after Red Dwarf in a milk crate of a space ship, I liked the old way of 
doing it better and this new stuff they're trying is bobbins!"

(Waft  over on a cloud of cheap,  glittery and unconvincing motion blur 
effects  to a parallel universe,  where they still have Red Dwarf,  and 
yes,  the  Daily  Mail  TV critic (TV as in television,  and not as  in 
dressing up in womens clothes, doh!) 

"I'm most disappointed in the long awaited series VII of Red Dwarf,it's 
merely  a  rehash  of  series six,  with the same  old  characters  and 
situations,  which  itself was a tired rehash of the jokes used in  the 
earlier  series..  Surely they could have come up with something new in 
the  three  years  they've  been off our  screens,  brought  in  a  new 
character perhaps?"

Brian Moanface - 'What's on View' - Daily Mail (Jan 1997)

The fundamental problem,  in my view at least,  was the three year gap, 
and  the  expectations and fond memories that had built  up  over  that 
period..  No new series, no matter how good, was ever going to overcome 
that..   The   interlude   in  our  Dwarf-watching  parallel   universe 
illustrates  that all too well,  as even the weak and tired series six, 
which showed that 'Dwarf was due for a rest at that time, was used as a 
critical tyre lever to beat the new series with, back in our universe..

Short on laughs? A criticism valid in some places, the final episode of 
the series had a lot of work to do in terms of plot,  and the first ten 
minutes of Dave Lister the amputee, and the crews attempts to deal with 
this were almost harrowing..  However, we had classic moments as Kryten 
ran  amok  on  Jane Austen World,  which must have been  some  sort  of 
cathartic  therapy for those of us sick of seeing yet  another  classic 
novel  adapted  for the tele..  The Arnold J Rimmer Experience  virtual 
theme  park  is another of those bits that go into the drawer  in  your 
brain marked 'classic bits that make me chuckle'.. 

That  woman!  It seems that the introduction of a new character,  taken 
together  with  the  (temporary) loss of Chris Barrie in  the  role  of 
Rimmer did not go down too well..  In some ways,  we seem to be back to 
the  very  early series of Red Dwrf where they  were  concentrating  on 
building up the relationships between the characters, never an easy job 
at the best of times..  You're adding the sexual tension between Lister 
and  Kochanski  (but not the other way!) and a new  irrational  jealous 
side  to  Kryten as he reacts badly to Kochanski..  At least  give  the 
writers credit for trying to do something new! Even the 'old' Red Dwarf 
had its flat moments after all..

Yes  I miss Rimmer as well,  but it's not all bad news there,  as he is 
scheduled to return fully in series eight.. Yes, there will be a eighth 
series,  and yes,  Chris Barrie wants to be in it.. There is a specific 
reason  for  why an eighth series is to be filmed this  year..  Another 
eight  episodes  brings the total number or Red Dwarf  episodes  up  to 
fifty  two,  which is the minimum number needed to syndicate the series 
on US television..  The other intriguing and related thing I overheard, 
courtesy  of  Kev 'Taff' Davies was "THE FILM WILL APPEAR IN  THE  YEAR 
2000, AND IT WILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL CAST IN IT!"

The  final  word comes from the viewing figures,  an unprecedented  8-9 
million, which is the top show for a 'minority' channel such as BBC2 or 
Channel 4, apparently twice as many viewers as the next best show! They 
must be doing *something* right!?

And I leave you now..
