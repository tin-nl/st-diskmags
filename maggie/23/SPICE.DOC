Thanks to Felice we already know  that  two  famous female actresses own STs and
regularly read Maggie. It is now time to turn our attention to the world of Pop.

The question on the nations' lips is "What Ataris do the Spice Girls own?"

Our Maggie investigative reporters have been out on a mission.
We were instructed to leave no stone  unturned,  no nook or cranny unspied into,
no lingerie drawer unopened...er, you get the picture.
