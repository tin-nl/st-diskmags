How to get computer stuff for {nearly} free
v1.5 (23/2/1997)
 
By John Hayward

The methods:

This  does  not involve legal hocus pocus,  nor any kind of fraud.  The 
trick  to get machines or peripherals for very little cash  is  simple,  
just  general computing knowledge,  some common sense,  and a trip to a 
small council owned  place a lot of us visit on sunday afternoons:

The tip!

- But the stuff must be useless or people would not dispose of it?

True,  but  we  live  in a wasteful society,  people often  dispose  of 
systems purely because they are  old, or because to get a dealer to fix 
something   is not worth it (typically a minimum of 40 plus  parts  and 
vat  normally)  and as they don't have knowledge or guts to  repair  it 
themselves, people often  chuck the whole thing away.  The machines you 
can get hold of are usually  faulty,  but sometimes you can get hold of 
working  stuff.  I have been doing  this for a couple of years now with 
some quite profitable results.

Computer  shops around industrial estates sometimes have skips  outside 
with   all  kinds  of stuff which to them they have  not  the  time  or 
inclination  to fiddle  with,  but to the casual hobbyist user a source 
of  dirt   cheap  servicable spare parts is there for  the  taking,  or 
sometimes even a whole working system can be obtained.

If  you cannot get the equipment working yourself,  discarded  machines 
can  be used for spares as trying to diagnose and repair faults can  be  
complicated  and expensive if you are not experienced,  but I can  tell 
you   40% of British buisnesses use obsolete XTs,  286s and 386s  which 
are   perfect  for their needs and don't need to upgrade,  which  means 
people  like   me and you can make some honest money from  spares  from 
dead systems otherwise destined to be landfill fodder.

Items I have got in 1996:- 
Amstrad 1512, IBM PC XT (2 of them), IBM PS/2s various models (at least 
4   of them) Compaq DeskPro 286e (3,  two of them worked!) and  386s/20 
(2)  ARC   Turbo  12 (286 based AT  clone)  Amstrad  PCW8256,  PCW8512, 
PCW9512  (there is  loads of demand for parts for these,  especially 3" 
drives)  Apple IIe and  Mac SE/30.   Epson FX-80 and FX-100 dot matrix, 
Epson  SQ2550  inkjet,  Howtek  Flatbed scanner,  various keyboards and 
mice and lots of manuals, some new.

Ideal salveagable parts:

Your typical PC has the following parts:-

- Power supplies (usually work if no physical damage, if they appear to 
be  wet, make sure they are properly dried off or they explode!) 

-  Motherboard  (normally the machine is scrapped if  this  develops  a 
fault,   you may be lucky though,  best thing to do is to sell it sold-
as-seen  for a  couple of quid.)  If you suspect it is dead,  then  the 
processor still may be  useful. 

- Memory, this can be one of the following. 
*  SIMMS,  small  pieces of the circuit board with chips on  which  are 
pushed  into sockets.  Normally these will be already removed. 
*  DRAMs  single  chips  which  may be  soldered  or  socketed  on  the 
motherboard  or mounted on a card.  The most commmon ones are marked as 
4164  or   41256,  only  worth  a  few pence  but  hold  onto  them.  
*Proprietry,  ie:  older  Apricots  and Compaqs have their own  special  
boards. 

-  Hard  disk.   Normally missing,  if machine looks though it has been  
dropped/damaged it is likely to be useless.   Cables are useful as well 
as  controller cards. 

-  Case (on well known PCs like IBMs and Compaqs that cannot support  a  
standard  clone motherboard there is normally no demand for  cases,  so 
you  might as well chuck it away,  keep all the screws and metal plates 
which go  over unused card slots at the back.) 

- Co-processors.  Extra chip added on the motherboard to speed  certain 
software  up.   Marked  8087,  287  or 387,  for 8086,  286 or 386 based  
machines.   Easily  prised  out and worth 2-10.   Normally is  optional 
extra  on most PCs so you might as well remove it from working machines 
as well. 

- Floppy drives 5.25" or 3.5".  Normally reliable, it is a good idea to  
carefully  disassemble  them  to get rid of the fluff  stuck  in  them.  
Amstrad   3"  units tend to be unreliable,  expensive and difficult  to 
replace,   although  kits are available to repair them as sometimes  it 
just the rubber  band on the bottom which has snapped or stretched. 

- Tape streamers.   Not worth much even working, best to just sell them  
sold-as-seen for a few quid. 

- Keyboards.   Pretty reliable,  most common fault is the DIN connector 
on   the  end  which  may have broken pins,  remove the  cable  of  the 
keyboard  and test with  a battery and bulb,  if any pins have  broken, 
you  may need to cut the end  off and solder a new connector on if  you 
can find which coloured wires go  to which pins.  Sometimes the plastic 
tops/springs can be missing. 

-  Mice.   Usually the rollers that are rubbed in contact with the ball 
get  all kinds of dirt clogged up in them.  Use alcohol solution to get 
the  dirt   loose and scrape off with a screw  driver.   Sometimes  the 
connection  plugs   break,  see  above  on  keyboards  to  replace  the 
connectors. 

-  Cards.   Normally  work.   Hard  disk controllers,  graphics  cards, 
network  cards etc. 

- Monitors.  Difficult to repair.  Don't bother with any obsolete types 
like  Hercules,  CGA, EGA, or anything monochrome, if the tube or line-
output   transformer  has gone it won't be worth it.   Colour  VGA  and 
Apple  monitors  should normally be economical to be repaired.   Office 
machines often have  screen burn which is impossible to remove  without 
replacing the picture tube. 

-  Dot matrix printers.   Normally scrapped if the print head starts to 
fade  or  if a pin blows.   In older Epson the motherboards tend to  go 
senile  and   refuse to recognise when you are trying to switch  it  on 
line.  You can  self-test most D/M printers by switching on and holding 
the Form Feed  button.  

-  Daisy wheel printers.   So old they're hardly worth bothering  with.  
Still demand for  the Amstrad units used on the PCW series. 

-  Inkjet  printers.   Rarely  turn  up as  they  are  normally  pretty 
reliable,   but  check the printhead has not blocked up and there is no 
ink spilt in to  the machine. 

-  Plotters.   Also rarely turn up as they are reliable,  plotters have  
rarely  changed in the last 10 years.   Hewlett-Packard and Roland ones 
are  nice. 

- Laser printers.  Extremely complicated amount of precision mechanical  
and  light sensitive parts,  make it almost impossible to repair by the  
casual  user.   If the drum (chemical coated light sensitive  aluminium  
cylinder)  has  been  exposed  to the light it  will  be  useless,  and 
expensive   to  replace.  In severely damaged machines,  toner may have 
leaked into the  rest of the machine and makes a terrible mess. Look on 
the  motherboard  (normally slides out) to see if there is  any  memory 
(usually SIMMs) worth  grabbing. 

-  Cables.   You  can  make your own serial cables,  monitor cables  or  
whatever.   Carefully desolder the connector, strip back the insulation 
and   decent lengths of multi-core cable can be reused.   25 and 9  way 
'D'   connectors can be reused as well as the plastic hoods are  always 
useful.   Use a battery and bulb to check the connections are good. 

- Large computers (eg:  UNIX systems,  minicomputers, fileservers) Have 
some  useful parts.   Floppy drives, tapestreamers, hard disks, cables, 
large  watt power supplies, etc. 

- Collectable computers.   Almost all computers have some value even if  
they  don't  work.   8 bit machines may be difficult to repair but  are 
sought   after  by collectors and although they may not  worth  a  huge 
amount now, are still worth hanging onto.

Useful  tools  to  begin recycling digital junk.   Not  all  these  are 
essential but they help.

* Philips screwdriver 
* Flat screwdriver 
* TORQ screwdriver (Most Compaqs and older small Macs need them) 
* Long nosed pliers 
* Hammer (for panel beating dented cases!) 
* Stanley Knife 
* Soldering iron & solder 
* Glue (for any small plastic parts which may have broken) 
* Isopropyl alcohol (tape head cleaning fluid to you and me,  great for   
  removing  labels, cleaning drive heads/mice rollers and other things,   
  costs about 1 a bottle from Tandys) 
* Simple battery and bulb circuit for testing pins on cables, etc. 
* Plastic tub to put screws, etc in. 
* Cardboard  boxes  to  put spare parts like  cables,  case  panels  & 
  brackets,  drives, cards etc. 
* WD40 (eject mechanisms on old floppy drives tend to seize up) 
* Kitchen cleaner and a piece of rag for cleaning cases. 
* White spirit or turpentine 
* Old PC, (ideally 286 with standard ISA slots) for testing stuff. 
* DOS disks 3.5" & 5.25" 
* Diagnostic software. 
* Small initial cost. 
* Storage space: garage/shed/loft/cupboard/spare bedroom. 
* Sympathetic wife/girlfriend/parents!

Ideal sources of equipment 
-------------------------- 
* Amenity sites (The tip) 
* Computer shops in industrial estates sometimes have skips outside. 
* Insurance companies and colleges sometimes throw stuff away. 
* Car boots 
* Jumble sales

Tips on selling recycled parts 
------------------------------
-  When sourcing items:

*  Don't pay too much to the tip man,  you don't what bits are going to  
work,  you usually have to pay anything from 2-10, but you can normally  
beat them down. 

*  Don't go anywhere you are not supposed to.   Do get permission  from  
companies  before taking stuff out of steel bins,  they shouldn't mind, 
the   skips  are  expensive to hire,  and you are doing them  a  favour 
getting rid  of the stuff!  Leave the place tidy afterwards. 

* At the tip, all electrical equipment will put to one side where it is  
sold  for a few quid,  have a rummage about and don't forget to look in 
the   steel bins,  even machines with smashed up cases have some useful 
parts. 

*  If you don't know if something works,  sell it cheap as sold-as-seen 
to  people who the knowledge to fix themselves so you don't waste money 
on  postage  having to get customers to send stuff  back  that  doesn't 
work. 

*  The  tip  may have other interesting things as  well  as  computers.  
Bikes,   pieces  of  wood, and  even  antique  furniture  can  turn  up 
sometimes.

-  Once you have obtained the gear:

*  Invariably equipment gets left in the rain and should be  dried  off  
carefully and inspected before being powered up. 

*  When you have got a machine partly working,  don't spend too much on  
parts  to make it whole,  you may not get much for it once it is  fully  
complete. 

* Don't open lethal high voltage items like power supplies and monitors  
whilst they are plugged in. 

* Small bits like unused drive panels, expansion slot covers and screws  
and  fixings and even the badges on front of the cases,  are all  worth  
keeping. 

* When you sell a working machine to a customer,  consider giving him a 
part   exchange on his existing machine whether it works or  not.   You 
then have  another system to rebuild or use for parts. 

* Long lengths of cable can be reused and made into other cables,  with 
new  connectors from Maplins. 

*  If you need start-up disks for machines,  I think Compaq and Apricot 
have  a free BBS service to download  these to get older machine going.  
Some  dealers also do this service for older well known PCs. 

*  Small  bits  that are missing can be obtained by putting  an  ad  in  
something  like MicroMart.   For example,  I put an ad for five keytops 
for my Amstrad 1512 keyboard, after which a guy sent me some  for  1.50 
including  postage. 

*  Scrap metal.   Unusable parts can sometimes be recycled for money at 
your   local scrap metal merchants,  by seperating aluminium and copper 
parts,   once  in large amounts are worth 40 and 80 pence a kilo.   Why 
not  collect  it for you local school,  hospital or charity?   I am not 
absolutely  sure,   but  I  think with gold chips,  although  they  are 
plated, it is possible to  extract the gold out of them.

-  Once you are ready to sell:

* Don't advertise lots of stuff at once in MicroMart otherwise they get  
suspicious and think you are a dealer.  (This happened to me!) 

*  Build up a address list of people who are regularly after parts  for  
specific machines, you may be able to do more business with them later. 

*  Do make sure you get customers money as cheque or PO before  sending  
parts. 

* Jiffy bags cardboard and bubble wrap are essential for mailing  items 
to  customers. 

* Do remember to tell customers the price includes postage.   Typically  
this is roughly 4 for a keyboard, 1.50-2.00 for a floppy drive. 

* Completely useless bits like cases,  monitor tubes,  etc can be taken 
back  to the tip, and you can pick up something else.
 
Computer slang. 
--------------- 

These  are  words which are not official jargon but are often  used  by 
people  in the computer trade.

* Big Blue.  Nickname for IBM. 
* Bootleg.  Pirated copy of something. 
* Clunker/Iron/Breadbasket.  General term for old banger computer. 
* Clunky.  Old fashioned, crude way of using something. 
* Luggable/Lunchbox.  Type of portable computer originally made British  
manufacturer,  Osborne.   Has  built  in  power supply,  not batteries, 
usually  has a glass screen tube, but sometimes has an LCD screen.  The 
most  popular ones were made by Compaq.   New ones still being made but 
not so  common now. 
* Reseller.  Stupid official word for a dealer. 
* Zebedee.   Special type of monitor stand, made of steel with a sprung  
lever normally found on IBM XGA monitors.   Named after the mustachioed  
sprung character from The Magic Roundabout.
 
Ideal uses for obsolete PCs: 
----------------------------

*  Word processing.   A system could be invaluable to charity or church 
for  day to day admin tasks. 

*  Satellite card emulation.   This is becoming a popular,  albeit very  
illegal  way of getting free subscriptions to channels on  a  satellite 
dish   receiver.   By  using any 286 with a cable that plugs into  your 
serial  port  with an interface that plugs in the card slot.   Software 
(which  needs  updating every quarter) is normally only available  from 
being downloaded  from a BBS. 

*  Phone  Phreaking.   Much the same as they above,  an art in dabbling 
with   things  the  telephone  company don't want  you  to  do.   Phone 
phreaking has  been popular since the mid 1970s. 

* Radio HAM.   I don't know very much about comms,  but radio HAM users 
are   happy to stick with cheap XTs and 286 for quick  no-nonsense  DOS 
based   software  and as old machines are more likely to have  6  or  8 
slots and  plenty of drive bays for easy upgrading/messing around. 

*  Storing  backups  of important files.   A program for the  Atari  ST 
called  Ghostlink lets you backup files via a null modem cable to store 
files on a  slave PC. 

*  Kids.   A  great way for a child to learn computing,  as well as for 
older   games  and  educational  software,  children can  learn  to  do 
upgrades  and  learn how a computer works as older machines have  cheap 
parts for  tinkering with.
 
To advertise parts 
------------------ 
- MicroMart 
- FreeAds (or whatever your local trading newspaper is) 
- Postcards in local supermarket

To send parts through the post. 
------------------------------- 

- Bubble wrap (you can get it from garden centres in metres but it's  a 
bit  expensive) 

-  Kitchen  cleaner (usually works well on cases to get them  nice  and  
shiny.) 

-  White spirit or turpentine (often people have written things on  the 
case  with a permanent marker which can be difficult to remove.) 

- Jiffy bags 

- Cardboard (boxes or flat pieces, you can get from shops.)  

-  Polystyrene  blocks,  can  be easily cut to any  shape  for  general 
packaging  or for mounting chips on. 

-  Anti-static bags are useful for storing chips,  motherboards,  cards 
and  memory. 

-  Pieces of foam (like you get on old flammable  furniture)  essential 
for  sending fragile things like hard disks. 

- Parcel tape (avoid the cheap stuff which breaks easily.) 

-  Print out a neat label with customer's address as well  as  fragile, 
this  way up, etc.
 
Have fun, remember you are doing the environment a favour by recycling!
Let me know if this has been any use to you.
