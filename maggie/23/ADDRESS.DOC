New E-Mail Address here!!

Contact us on:  felice@zetnet.co.uk

This  is  the  ***new E-Mail address*** There should  also  be  a 
cih@zetnet.co.uk address as well..

The  felice and cih@rushden.demon.co.uk mailboxes still have  not 
been  closed  down  yet,  but  don't rely  on  them  being  there 
forever..  Best  to use the Zetnet address..  Zetnet are probably 
the most Atari friendly Internet provider out there, and a lot of 
users have switched over to them on that premise..

Maggie Web Pages!!

Just click on the following..

Click on the diskmags icon and take it from there..

(May 1997 update)

There  is still a Maggie presence on the Stosser Soft site,  some 
slight  revamps have been made to it thanks to Tony G,  and there 
will be more to follow once we've got this issue out of the way..


Where do I get the latest Maggie online?

ftp.uni-kl.de  [in]  pub/atari/incoming
               [or]  pub/atari/diskmagazines

Alternatively,  try  your  usual  bulletin board..  One  definite 
location with its own Maggie dedicated file area for back  issues 
etc,  is  42  BBS,  who  can be contacted on the  following  (UK) 
telephone number, which goes as follows, 01256 895106..


Who do I contact concerning this diskmag?

CIH's address(es) (see above)..

(The inevitable plea)

Maggie  is  a 'happening' diskmag,  that is,  it 'happens' as and 
when  we have enough articles to do a new issue..  If you want it 
to 'happen' a bit more often,  then some more articles might be a 
good  idea..  Our regular contributors would really enjoy the odd 
new perspective now and again, and who knows, it could be the key 
to eventual fame and fortune for you..

Now  I'm not going to threaten to close the mag if no-one  writes 
in  like  some other diskmag editors tend to do,  we enjoy  doing 
this too much to do that, but I'm really enamoured of the idea of 
sitting  back  and watching a whole host of  third  party  talent 
flood into the mag, prodded along by helpful threats from me, the 
editor..  I  often  have  dreams about it..  Come on,  make those 
dreams come true!! - Write today!
