                 C64 Soundchip emulator for the Falcon

There  seems to be some kind of strange symmetry involved here,  as  we 
were waiting for a very long time for a SID chip emulator on the ST  or 
Falcon  and  had to put up with countless very good imitations  in  the 
meantime.. Then Cream release their SID player which is first seen last 
summer,  and  gets  loud cheers and rave reviews from us.. Now,  at the 
beginning of 1997,  we get an entirely new team working on the problem, 
and  coming  up  with a very different solution..  The new  upstart  is 
FlaySID,  and  we  have the team of David Carrere and Mikhael Myara  to 
thank for that..

The  version of FlaySID is version 1.1,  released in January 1997..  In 
contrast to the Cream program,  this is GEM based,  and uses some quite 
nice  design,  including  3-D  buttons,  and is clearly intended for  a 
Falcon  only..  FlaySID  can  be run as a standalone program,  or  even 
better,  as  a desk accessory..  This overcomes the one weakness of the 
Cream  effort,  which  basically  seized total control of  your  Falcon 
whilst  you used it..  FlaySID allows you to have SID music whilst  you 
work, without too much of a performance penalty, although we'll discuss 
that again a bit later..

FlaySID  is designed to be as robust as possible,  and even to be MagiC 
and   NVDI   compatible,   although  the  authors  warn  agains   using 
MiNT/MultiTOS..  Loading  files overcomes the restrictions of the Cream 
player,  as  it  recognises both the Amiga *.PSD format files,  and the 
two-part  files used by the PC players..  

Playback quality is good,  if not quite up to the superb quality of the 
Cream  player,  as  we get a choice of 20 or 25 khz replay,  the latter 
being  the  default  mode..  The choice is made  available  as  earlier 
versions of the player did have speed problems in playing back  certain 
tunes,  and  there  is still a more noticeable slowdown in relation  to 
using  other  applications,  say if you get a tune with copious  sample 
data playing..  However,  on the plus side, SID replay is more accurate 
in  places  than on the version 1.0 of the Cream player,  with  effects 
such  as  the Galway Digi-drums interpreted correctly,  and one or  two 
others  that  refused  to  play at all previously,  now  happy  to  co-
operate..

For  fans of general weirdness,  there is even a selectable mode for ST 
soundchip  emulation,  which  uses  the  Yamaha YM2149  directly  in  a 
passable imitation of Mad Max sound (at a greatly reduced volume)..

Technically, this one does use the DSP and main processor together, the 
player emulates both the SID chip itself, and the 6502 main CPU used by 
the C64..  As a deskacc,  it takes up 300kb of RAM..  (Well worth it, I 
might add!)

The  GEM  interface  is based on the universally  understood  audio  CD 
player  front  panel principle,  with the usual controls  for  loading, 
running,  pause, stop, fast forward etc.. This is recommended to run in 
any 80 column mode, but not Truecolour as this is too slow.. Other user 
definable  controls  include  the switch  to  ST  soundchip  previously 
mentioned,  variable  scan  rates  for  NTSC video  mode,  double  host 
buffering,  with  some  more tantalisingly blank boxes still yet to  be 
filled in..

In use, FlaySID does not impose a noticeable performance penalty if you 
are  using  a low-powered application such as the one I'm  typing  with 
now..  It is more robust and less crash prone than most, and whilst not 
completely   bombproof,   is   pretty  good,   even  surviving  another 
application  going down..  The program is supplied with several example 
music  files,  some  of which I'm already familiar with,  but there are 
also  many  unknown tunes,  some of which are dated sometime after  the 
supposed  heyday of Commodore 64 activity,  and seem to have originated 
from the activities of the still busy demo scene on that machine.. 

The   amazing   reliability  of  FlaySID,   combined  with  the   total 
desirability of a 'must have' musical application means it has earned a 
permanent place on my accessories slot..

Finally, to finish up, here are the two brilliant people responsible..
