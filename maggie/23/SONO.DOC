                                A Demo By Avena


Wheeeeeeeeee!

The high pitched scream surfs out of the speakers.

In the horizon, clouds appear. We feel the sensation of weightlessness.
We are flying over an ocean.

Beneath us waves rise and fall.
The scream has evolved into bubbling acidic sounds.

Splash!

We crash down into the water. Its more serene here, below the surface.

A school of fish swim past leaving a trail of bubbles in their wake.
These are  no  two  dimensional  sprites  though,  these  are  fully  fledged 3D
environment mapped vector creatures who propel themselves through the water with
a exaggerated flick of their tails.

In the background we can see shafts of sunlight bursting through the surface.

A huge environment mapped dolphin glides onto the screen.
It turns to bid us a friendly hello.
"Welcome to the party!", it seems to say, before rotating and diving off.

We must have travelled  deeper  as  there  is  now  no  light reaching the murky
depths. The fish move in a dreamlike manner leaving motion blurred trails behind
them. As we study  them  closer  the  trails  get  larger  and larger eventually
covering the entire screen.

We surface for air, blinking in the brilliant white light.

The music calms down to give us some  respite,  a chance to fill our lungs again
with delicious oxygen.

We blink furiously, like Han Solo released from carbonite. The blinding light is
starting to take shape and we can  see  letters  forming. It appears to be spell
the word "Avena". As the music slides  to a different pitch, the letters quietly
fade away.

The large painted letters of  the  word  "Sonolumineszenz" come strolling across
the screen. They fade leaving anticipation in the air.

The drums begin. With  each  beat  a  symbol  is  flashed  on  the screen. These
hieroglyphics seem to bear a strong  resemblance to the mysterious marking found
on the back of Falcon  cases.  Somewhere, an archaeologist frantically scribbles
down notes.

The drumroll stops leaving us staring at a tree.

This is no piece of static graphics, this is a fully three dimensional tree.
And it seems to be a bit of a raver.

Its arms sway manically to the pulsing techno rhythm like Ken Clarke after a bag
full of disco biscuits.

A letter S then stamps itself onto the  screen  and the camera cuts over to look
at an insect.

It is a fully texture mapped 3D  bee  and  it  is flapping its wings and merrily
spinning around the screen. It is also rather large.

The camera then quickly intercuts between  the  Tree and Bee, interspersing them
with letters. All this action  is  superbly  synchronised  to the music which is
growing in intensity and excellence.

As the trees boughs swing nearer to the screen we unconsciously duck lest we get
a twig in the eye.

The bee is getting rather manic  and  is  making  a desperate bid for freedom by
trying to fly out of the screen.

The drums roll, the cymbals crash!
Crash! The bee hits the screen and it cracks! The world shivers.

It is now tumbling away spinning hopelessly in space.

The tree, meanwhile, has succeeded in its  audition  to become a member of Pan's
People by virtue of its rhythmic branch spinning.

The flashing letters. The tree. The Bee. The fantastic pulse of the music.
We are entranced by this fusion of sound and three dimensional graphics.

But the drums roll again and the  foolhardy insect makes another beeline for the
glass.

Crash!

We are whisked from this scene and transplanted to a gloomy apartment in Bremen.

Here, Fried of Avena sits contemplating an empty bottle of vodka.
He is tired, and quite possibly emotional.

We are off again, this time into outer space.

Here a flat polygon surface floats above our face.
From this rises a schizophrenic 3D mapped head.
Obviously not happy with  its  physical  appearance  it  morphs  itself into all
manner of shapes including a sphere  and  a triumphant fuji before resuming back
to a more skull like posture and sucking itself back onto the flat plane.
Must have a tremendous headache after all that muscular exertion.

The drums roll.

FLASH!

We are inside an environment mapped object

FLASH!

  which is rotating around whilst the world flashes

FLASH!

    in time with the beat.

FLASH!

      As drum hits and everything flashes

FLASH!

        the surreal colours change. We are in a mystical, psychedelic world.


Again the drums roll.

A massive three dimensional head greets us.
It spins and with every flash of the beat its mapping and shading change.

An increase in tempo is the signal for  these  heads to fly down the screen away
from us. Headlong out of here you could  say. But one returns and heads so close
to us that you expect he is destined  for a similar fate as the bee. Fortunately
he is saved by a fade down.

More extravagantly  shaded  complex  3D  objects  now  appear  in  time  to  the
relentless rhythm.

The music changes and we are whisked into a tunnel.

Initially everything seems bright and blurred, but slowly things seem to clarify
themselves as the colours of the tunnel  texture morph from light into something
more sinister.

We briefly emerge from  this  twisting  labyrinth  to  see  some more 3D objects
merrily dancing to Tommy's techno beat.  We  give  them a deranged grin and dive
back into the tunnel.

We are enjoying speeding through the textured tube when again we are plucked out
of it to see the biggest 3D  texture  mapped environment mapped object ever seen
on the Falcon.

It is a massive texture mapped head which fills a large portion of the screen as
it rotates around to stare at us. We are awestruck.

If someone asked if Avena gave good head, the answer would have to be yes.

We sense the end is near as the letters of  A  V  E N A fly out of the screen at
us. Naturally there are environment mapped with glorious backgrounds.

This all too much! Our brains  are  on  overload.  We  lie panting and the black
screen trying to recover from such an immense trip.

Another brilliant piece of underwater graphics bids us Bon Voyage.

We wipe our sweating brows. And this was just the "lite" version.....






What can I say but "Wow"!

Tat has been threatening to release a  demo  for  the last two years, but due to
general laziness from other members of  Avena  this looked highly unlikely until
about a month before the Siliconvention.

The initial environment mapping routines  were  coded  at Symposium, and to tell
the truth blew away every  other  effect  on  all  the demos released there. Tat
decided not to rush them out there, but to  build a demo around them, and it has
been worth the wait.


With most demos you say "I like the  bit when...." or "this effect is good". You
single out the good effects. With Sono  you can't really isolate individual bits
for praise because the whole thing is so bloody brilliant.

Technically this demo is by far the  most  impressive  on the Falcon. It is also
one of the few demos to really utilise the  power of the DSP. Surely there is no
coincidence here and other demo crews  are  going  to  have to master the DSP if
they want to impress us.

But  good  demos  aren't  just  about  technical  merit,  they  are  also  about
entertainment and Sono wins hands down  on  this  score. The music, as you would
expect from Tommy, is exceptional and all the effects sync superbly with it. The
whole demo was actually designed around  the  music,  which seems to be the best
way to do things.

This demo can be appreciated by those  who don't really follow or understand the
demo scene because of the music and impressive and innovative visuals.

It is also good in the fact that it doesn't rehash old effects.
Lets face it we are sick  of  seeing  Rotating  Zoomers, star tunnels, simple 3d
texture mapped cubes  and  bloody  z-buffering.  Bump  mapping  seems  to be the
flavour of the month at the  moment,  but  we  don't  want to see it imitated on
every single new Falcon demo.
Lets hope that Sono sets a trend for originality and innovation in demos.

Sonolumineszenz is the best demo on the Falcon.  It is the new benchmark for all
other demos to be compared  against.  Aggression  must be kicking themselves for
not releasing "Motion" earlier!

It is brilliant then in a  world  that  is  supposedly  dominated by PCs we have
people as talented as  Tat  still  on  the  Falcon  scene.  If  I  was a "jungle
selector" I  would  probably  say  something  like  "Big  Up  The  Littleborough
Massive!".

But as I'm just an ordinary person, I'll just say "Wow".
