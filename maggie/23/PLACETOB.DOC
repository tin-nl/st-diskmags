The   Place  to  be  5  invite  intro  is  probably  the   first   post 
Siliconvention  piece of demo coding..  We have the combined talents of 
Scarface, Eagles,  and  even  EKO to thank for this,  running under the 
combined aegis of the MIPS Association.. 

It  starts  in a considerately multilingual manner,  giving a start  up 
menu  with suitable choice of languages..  Not wishing to rock the boat 
excessively,  we  opt  for  'English' and sit back to  await  the  demo 
proper..  For  the  main  'hard coding' part,  we get a series  of  3-D 
objects,  starting  with  a simple gouraud cube,  progressing through a 
phong  shaded toaster,  and ending up with a very detailed phong shaded 
cow,  udders and all.. Perhaps this could have been the missing part in 
our Maggie 20 burning pig intro??

There is a penalty, and that happens to be speed related, with the more 
complex  objects suffering from a massive amount of  judder  onscreen.. 
Maybe they should have a word with Tat sometime??

It ends with a further menu giving information about different  aspects 
of the forthcoming party, with a typically French 'design' look to it.. 
Once having digested the fact that Centurbo accelerated Falcons will be 
catered  for  in the competitions (similar to Nemesis),  it is time  to 
quit,  but there is a final Windows 95 inspired sting in the tail as an 
error message is generated and you don't actually get to go back to the 
desktop without a reset..

Ratings..

Graphics:- 88% - Several good 3-D objects,  firm stamp of French design 
all over it..

Sonix:- 78% - Music, yes there is some.. Okay,if unmemorable

Gee-Whiz:-  85%  - Tries out some daring and complex 3-D  objects,  but 
runs them very slowly..

Overall:-  85% - A good intro which could have done with just a  little 
bit more smoothness..
