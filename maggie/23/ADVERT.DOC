Right then,  let's not fanny about here.   I want a decent assembly coder. 
Thats it. 

I want to produce a Hardcore Dancefloor type of demo.  I have done all  of 
the graphics and all of the tracker music(wicked Hardcore Jungle) and that 
is it. What I want is for someone to be able to write the code. I'm a STOS 
coder, but STOS isn't really up to handling 15Khz sound with some  effects 
and a scroller or two. 

Also,  some of the mods are quite large.  About 250k each(average),  if  a 
packer like the one used in the TSCC collections is used then I'm sure  at 
least 5 modules can be used. 

I also want the option of playing some nice 25/50Khz music,  if an STE  or 
Falcon is being used. Some VU's would also be nice.

If you think you are up to the job then give me a  shout  and I will give 
you some exact details. This will be graphically and musically better than
both Hardcore Dancefloor and Slam  which are still very popular  today!
