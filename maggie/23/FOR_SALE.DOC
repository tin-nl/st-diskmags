THE LONDON CALL GIRL CARDS DISC - a collection of sixteen 200 DPI  scans 
of  call-girl  advertising  cards.   As  seen  in  most  central  London 
phoneboxes,  and on London Weekend Televison!  These IMG scans are of  a 
very  high  quality,  and  the  disc comes with  two  articles  (plus  a 
bibliography)  that explain the background to these  sometimes  bizarre, 
but always entertaining cards. Each card consists of a picture, text and 
telephone number,  and are suggestive rather than pornographic, and with 
drawings to match.  The subjects include bondage, caning and 'obedience' 
- the Tottenham Court Road specialities.

The scans can be viewed as a slideshow,  and each card can be printed at 
actual size (6" x 4") from any WP or DTP prog.

PRICE:  Send Eight (8) 1st class stamps to the address given  below, and 
we'll rush the disc to you by return of post.

THE  FUTURE:  We're writing a book about the Call Girl Card  phenomenom, 
which  will  be self-published later this year.  It'll be  done  in  two 
stages;  as a 'taster' booklet, selling for well under a fiver, and then 
later  as a full book.  This will cover:  advertising and  prostitution, 
'the two oldest professions'; a history of prostitutes' advertising from 
ancient Greece to the present day;  historical directories of madams and 
houses;  the realities of modern prostitution;  the legal idiocies;  and 
the  cards themselves.  The cards will be covered in depth,  giving  the 
full background to them and the various attempts at supressing them. 

Each version will be illustrated with as many cards as we can squeeze in.
They're fascinating objects in themselves, and we've watched them evolve
over the last five years from photocopied scraps to multi-coloured cards.
At this rate, we'll soon have the photo-cards that you see in Tokyo and
Las Vegas!

If you're interested in either the booklet or the full book,  then write 
and  tell  us  and we'll add you to the mailing list  for  when  they're 
completed.  We can't reply to every letter individually,  but we'll hold
onto your name and address, and you'll then receive full details of each
publication as soon as it's ready.
