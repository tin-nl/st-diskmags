This collection represents another general/generic collection of  Atari 
related data files according to the whim of the maker,  who happened to 
be the zappily titled M.Wehner BBS..  This disk,  along with an earlier 
Skyline  disk is distributed by System Solutions,  which is where  this 
came from..

The  disk contents probably reflect what was a straight dump  from  the 
BBS hard drive, as the contents are a right mixture..

Nothing  really  up to date for the Falcon,  this collection is over  a 
year  old,  and  Falcon  owners are always better off  getting  a  more 
specific  collection tailored for their machine..  There is not  really 
any  strong overrriding theme there,  as several ST based audio  sample 
demos have a place,  there is a large collection of utilities,  most of 
them  with  a heavy German language component..  There are  some  MagiC 
utilities  for  users  of that O/S,  and a good choice  of  replacement 
desktops and demo versions of new O/S's as well..

On  the  'fun' side,  a collection of rather old PC/mag  generated  GIF 
files, most of these have a rather early 'eighties feel about them, and 
don't  really  compare well,  say with the hand-drawn or rendered  demo 
scene originated material coming from recent competitions.. Music tends 
to be more of those inevitable .MOD files, again, most of these seem to 
spring  from  the dawn of time,  sounding very much like vintage  Amiga 
efforts with those samples that you've heard a thousand times before..

On the good side,  and including one thing that made the disk worth it, 
all  on  its own,  was the extensive collection of .WAV files,  many of 
which had the wit and ambition to go further than the usual and tedious 
Star  Trek sound bites..  (That door 'swish' is the second most tedious 
computer played sound,  after those people who insist on the 'HAL 9000' 
boot-up sample!! Kill 'em all!)

The rather formal sounding and stiffly named M.Wehner must be a Ren and 
Stimpy fan,  as several .WAVs from that show are on the disk,  and best 
of  all  *THE  COMPLETE  HAPPY  HAPPY  JOY  JOY  SONG!!*  (For   anyone 
interested, it just about fits on a standard high density floppy)..

From  an  initial impression of indifference,  I ended up quite  liking 
this little collection! (For the most trivial reasons, but heck, the CD 
ROM format lets you do that after all!)
 
Ratings..

Content:- 70% - A hit and miss mixture,  with no dominating theme,  but 
one  or  two  pleasant surprises..  A bit diluted with  some  very  old 
material too..

Ease  of  Use:-  70% - Reasonably well laid  out,  but  heavily  German 
language based, which may restrict its appeal to non-German speakers..

Overall:-   68% - A pretty average collection offering nothing  new  at 
the end of the day..
