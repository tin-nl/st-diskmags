                         by Kev "TaFf" Davies

Well here we are, its about that time again.Yet another opportunity to
extract the urine from "Independence Day". This time we have a look at
the series of coincidences that allow mankind to win the day.

1. Jeff Goldblum's  laptop  computer just happens to have the software
   that can convert the alien signal into the countdown.

2. Jeff's ex-wife just happens to work for the president.

3. Will Smith just happens to crash land near Area 51

4. The  aliens  do  not  know  about Area 51, even  though most of the
   population of this planet does.

5. Brent Spiner  is  the  only  man  in  the A-51 clean room without a
   protective suit, thus buggering  up  all  the  experiments that are
   going on.

6. The US government are able to understand and repair the alien craft
   without being able to switch it on.

7. Jeff Goldblum is  able  to create  a  virus to penetrate the  alien
   system. This means that he must  be able to understand a completely
   alien OS and machine architecture. Yeah of course he can ;->

9. The aliens are using some kind of packet radio system to communicate
   (This is the only  explanation   as   to  how  Jeff down  loads  the
   virus,the aliens ain't on the 'net)

10. The alien craft has bucket  seats of human  proportions even though
    the alien bio-suites are about 7 feet tall.
