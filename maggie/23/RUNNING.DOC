                   Running (Shareware Version 1.0)
                  A Shareware Game for the Falcon030
                           Steve Tattersall


Way, way back in the mists of time, a time when the Lost Blubb demo 
was not even a twinkle in Lazer's 8 collective eyes, there was a 
small group of Germans who thought that making a version of 'Doom'
for the Falcon might be a bit of a laugh. That group was Stax, and 
though they were not the only people around who had the same idea, 
only they have been able to get a full game produced from it, more 
than two years after they started.

Yes, it's that 'Running'! You probably first saw it as the little 
demo from the Fried Bits 3, where it was little more than a small 
graphics demo. Now it's a full game, and major credit to the Running 
Development Team for getting it released. So what's it like?

Shareware Running comes in two archives of 1.6 megabytes in total, 
but expands to just under 5 megabytes. As my hard drive only contains 
15 megs on each partition, I had to delete almost everything except 
the essentials to even unpack the thing. With 500K free, I read the 
textfile, only to find out that the game creates a 1meg temporary 
file on your drive! (Those of you cringing at the thought of 6megs of 
drive space should remember that the average PC game now swallows 
100megs of your disk space...)

After more deletion and hoping I'd backed all my files up recently, I 
ran the game. The two years of development show: the title is 
attractively designed throughout, and it is clear that considerable 
effort has been expended on every part of the program. No dodgy 
preview version is this.

The introductory menu (with a very nice modfile) gives options for 
sound and screen display - and a chance to see the creators' faces -
unfortunately ;) - or to play the game straight away. So it's into 
the game we go...


                           Running Running


The first thing you see is our hero's laptop computer, which pops up 
from time to time throughout the game. Point One: This is no 'Doom' 
clone. The gameplay does involve running around and shooting, but 
there is a bit more thought and strategy necessary when playing 
'Running'. The laptop gives you the mission objectives (rescue 
hostages, find some dynamite) and it's into the main 3D area.


                               Graphics

Time to check out the graphics driver, and we are pleasantly 
surprised. Not lightning fast on an unexpanded Falcon, but perfectly 
playable. To speed up the screen update there are various options 
available such as shrinking the screen, toggling doublescan or 
removing the console / crosshairs / weapon, but you can play 
reasonably well even in normal mode.

Compared to the Bad Mood graphics engine it stands up well. Both use 
the DSP extensively, but Running sacrifices the (unnecessary) floor 
textures to gain extra ounces of speed. Both use BSP trees for 
sorting (leading to the occasional display bug, I suspect due to 
rounding errors) and Running even manages see through walls for 
fences and suchlike, plus animated sky textures, and of course 
sprites!

                               Gameplay

...which leads me back the game itself. Right from the start you are 
required to practise your kung-fu skills on the hapless victims and 
insert a size xxxx [change as applicable] boot into their faces with 
both considerable force and a great sample that sounds like the 
programmers were really unleashing their frustration on something. 
From the boot you graduate on to the pistol and other weapons.

Tootling through the game world in search of something approaching a 
hostage, I was impressed by the scale of the levels and the numerous 
touches that are there. The one level (sorry, section) available in 
the Shareware version is complex and well-designed, and on the way 
you can interact with computers, see remote cameras and generally 
poke your nose everywhere you want. I did however manage to walk 
through a wall semi-backwards at one point, but was this a bug or a 
game secret? Let's just call it a 'feature'.

In overall game style the whole thing reminded me of Duke Nukem 3D on 
the PC: and seeing as this was a pretty good game, all you Falcon 
owners should be sharpening your chequebooks...



Now, being the terrible gamesplayer that I am, and not having much 
time before I had to delete the games and reinstall my demo data 
files, I shall admit to not getting very far in 'Running'! Despite 
this I can safely say that Running sets new standards for all Falcon 
games to come. Ratings range from 'good' to 'excellent' in all 
departments, and we can wholeheartedly recommend that everyone should 
immediately go and buy the registered version from the makers (it is 
a measly 45 Deutschmarks, after all - and they've hardly done it for 
the money!) Now, where can I get a bigger hard drive??
