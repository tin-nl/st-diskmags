And  everyone is still staggering about under a caseload of  post  Xmas 
blues,  but signs of new life are detected about to burst from the soil 
in a springlike renaissance, or something..

Anyway,  this time, we take in one or two new publications, and revisit 
a  few  old friends..  First up,  a newish publication which is due for 
some Maggie related attention..  And so,  ladeez and gentlemen, we give 
you..


                          ST Highway Issue 4

ST  Highway  is the creation of one Jake Nicholls,  a chap who is  even 
younger than James Mathews was, when he started up 'Power Diskmag'.. ST 
Highway has been going a little while, and even got the attention of ST 
Format, although not favourably with a grudging 27% review for an early 
issue..

From a technical or 'shell spotters' point of view it started off  with 
the  seen  it all before TOMS shell,  graduating to a superior  version 
called  DENS  for  this issue onwards..  The DENS shell is   still  GEM 
based,  but  offers a more custom looking interface with cascading menu 
bars  and buttons in the traditional manner,  quite a nice looking one, 
with the right choice of four colour medium res menu picture which  has 
happily  happened in this case..  This does have other uses as you  are 
allowed  to access the accessories menu for your own choice  of  music, 
whether it be a conventional modfile player,  or Commodore 64 SID music 
types (See 'FlaySID' review for more details).. 

Loading a textile defaults to a fairly standard text displayer, in this 
case, a little number called Videomagik.. The usual commands, up, down, 
help, escape etc, are all included.. The shell runs reliably, even on a 
Falcon  switched  down  to  ST medium  resolution,  but  there  is  the 
occasional  crash  which  may  be  something to  do  with  a  built  in 
screensaver that kicks in if you don't access the menu within a certain 
time..  This  is  not too much of a problem as you just click  away  to 
start  again..  Even  the robust FlaySID carries on playing  without  a 
murmur, which is nice..
 
Textually,  it  is slightly less less thrilling with a small helping of 
original  text,  quite  a  lot  in the 'need contacts'  and  small  ads 
department, and a huge dollop of netgrabs.. The written english side of 
things leaves a bit to be desired,  but allowances can be made for that 
as Jake is still bound and gagged to his schooldesk as it were..

Some  things  do  stand  out..  There are small signs  of  an  evolving 
partnership  with  John Hayward,  the new deputy editor,  and WAG  club 
member,  something that just might grow some more to give the mag a bit 
more  depth  than  it  has at the moment..  He  contributes  a  notably 
informative  feature  on the new Atari clones and a neat  and  succinct 
Autumn Atari Show report among other things.. You can read a 'Room 101' 
piece,  which  may  just have been taken from the TV show of  the  same 
name,  a bit like our 'In the Trashcan' feature did in fact! This tends 
to  be a one sided unsophisticated straightforward 'rant'  column  with 
Morpheus  in the driving seat for this issue,  rather than our  two-way 
affair which is a bit more faithful to the concept of the original.. 

There  are several 'retro-reviews' of oldish ST games which are  pretty 
readable,  even one or two famous names seen on other computers.. Names 
like 'Jet Set Willy' in fact (I sort of half-remember someone doing  an 
Amiga version but didn't realise it ever made it to the ST??) The small 
ads  and contacts sections perform a useful service for quite a lot  of 
people,  and  are  commendable for keeping a general scene going..  You 
will  also find several interviews which are generally worth looking at 
as well..

The  blot  on  this issue as far as I am concerned,  and yes,  it is  a 
matter of personal taste, so you can hit me afterwards for saying this, 
is  the  overlarge  'netgrab' devoted to UFOs and the  legions  of  sad 
Americans  with too much unproductive leisure time that cluster  around 
the Internet with their barely thought out 'conspiracy' theories..  The 
problem with UFOs and related stuff, is that it has already been run in 
more than one diskmag, I can think of a couple of other diskmags in the 
past that have used very similar,  if not identical material..  It does 
not get any more interesting the third time around!!

This  is  probably  not  Jakes fault,  as he may not  have  seen  other 
diskmags  that  go quite a long way back,  some ST Highway readers  may 
well  be grateful to him for bringing the material to  their  attention 
for the  first time..  To me,  having seen it before,  it is an instant 
turn-off..  It illustrates two points,  firstly the need to check up on 
your  netgrabs  to make sure they haven't been used before  in  another 
publication..  Secondly  that a lot of people seem to have depressingly 
limited and samey tastes,  X-Files,  UFOs,  Star Trek, and that's their 
lot..  And now, I have a death warrant from the large Atari based 'Trek 
community to contend with, as well as the kicking due from Jake and the 
UFO fans!

If you must use netgrabs, dare to be different!

I prefer more original writing.. Now that would be *really* different!!

At the end of the day,  we can't do Jake down at all.. This is probably 
one  of the most enthusiasm driven publications on the  current  scene, 
both  from  the  editor,   and  even  more  so  from  the  readers  and 
contributors  who  give  the impression that they  are  enjoying  every 
word..  There is a fair amount to read,  and we would certainly rate it 
more highly than Format's miserly 27%,  even if we'd like to see it try 
a bit harder in certain areas in the future..  

Summary:-  Sort  of  custom  looking,   but  GEM  really  menu  shell.. 
Distributed  on fairly frequent 'as and when' basis..  Comes on one D/S 
disk  and  is  Falcon compatible in ST screen  modes..  Articles,  some 
fairly  basic  original  material,   and  quite  a  lot  of  netgrabs.. 
Prospects,  will  have  the unquestioned support of their part  of  the 
scene for quite a while, should get slowly better as time goes on..

Overall, six out of ten..


                             ST+ issue 14

Moving  onto  a more established format,  and ST+ is arguably the  most 
successful  of the new wave of diskmags that came about over  the  last 
year..  Well  you  can try to argue,  but I doubt it will get you  very 
far..

Since  those  early  issues that showed so  much  promise,  we've  been 
keeping a discreet eye on them,  often helping out in a spare moment or 
two,  and  we can confirm that the mag has a steady assured mature look 
about it now, going on as it has for fourteen issues..

They  are lucky in having several things in their favour,  not least of 
which  being  the  active  and ongoing support  of  Tony  Greenwood  in 
developing  the  menu  shell..  It is broadly the same as the  form  it 
reached in issue six,  with a fancy graphical menu interface,  pictures 
in text, online help screens, user definable wotsits coming out of your 
ears,  and more.. This fact belies the huge amount of under the surface 
work by Tony Greenwood in getting the shell just that little bit better 
for each new issue..

He  experimented with,  and eventually discarded sampled speech in  the 
shell,  there  was  the facility added for two disk issues,  which  has 
become slightly irrelevant as things like picture compression got  more 
advanced.. Soundchip music has made a comeback, but best of all, it now 
works properly on the Falcon!

As a STOS based shell,  it has been coaxed to work properly on the '030 
as of this issue.. Previously, a session with 'Backwards' was needed to 
run it..  Not any more, as this can now install onto the hard drive and 
can  run  straight from most sensible Falcon  screen  modes..  Someone, 
somewhere,  and  I'm  not  sure if it is Tony  G.  himself,  recommends 
dropping the speed down to 8mhz,  not a chance matey!  The extra Falcon 
sponsored speed adds greatly to the slickness aspect, and this  menu is 
transformed  into  a model of efficiency,  albeit one with  a  slightly 
puzzling  pause  when you go to quit an article,  as if the ghost of  a 
non-existent sample is still playing.. Falcon owners lose the soundchip 
music,   as  this  was  assessed  to  be  the  final  barrier  to  full 
compatibility  by me in a brief beta tester role..  Thousands of Falcon 
owners were not found weeping in the gutter as a result..

Something  else  musical  that  Dave Hollis  touched  on,  also  had  a 
fascinating follow-up.. His editorial explained that Falcon owners were 
likely to be using their own modfile players in the background, instead 
of the warbly soundchip variety..  I try out the 'Rape the DSP' modfile 
playing  deskacc  in a spirit of 'What the hell,  it'll probably  crash 
anyway', and in spite of my misgivings, the thing worked!! Changing the 
tune  was a different matter though,  as this necessitated an exit from 
the  shell program each and every time..  If the GEM desktop is left in 
place  whilst the shell is running,  maybe a menu option to get to  the 
desk accessories from within the shell would be a good idea?

It  is even possible to leave ST+ and go back to the desktop and  carry 
on from there,  something which it never allowed you to do before.. The 
scarey  looking  four bomb crash is incidental,  and should  not  worry 
you..

Moving onto the content of this issue,  we start with the menu graphics 
which  are  themed as 'marine' for this issue,  as some  killer  whales 
threaten  to  swim  right  through the  text  selector  window..  Other 
graphics in the intro,  the file loading screen etc, also carry on this 
marine  theme  as  well..  Most  of  these started  life  in  a  higher 
resolution  and more colours than normally seen on a standard  ST,  but 
converted down rather well..

Textually,  there  has been a lot of movement since we started to  take 
critical  notice  of this mag..  Most of the regular  contributors  are 
still around, some have departed, but other newer talent is joining in, 
so  the balance is roughly equal..  The mag is uniquely organised  into 
several  different  sections,  each headed by their own  'editor'  with 
their own style and input, more or less a mini-magazine within a bigger 
entity..  This  method  works as long as there are several willing  and 
committed  writers,  which  ST+  is fortunate to have at  the  moment.. 
Anybody  who fancies the challenge of producing and editing  their  own 
diskmag,  but  needs to get relevant experience could do no worse  than 
serve an apprenticeship as one of Dave's sub-editors in ST+ perhaps??

Some  writers  take  occasional or more extended  breaks  away  due  to 
circumstances  beyond their control..  Issue fourteen sees the  welcome 
return  of  Jody  'mad  for it' Smith,  after a break of  a  couple  of 
issues..  Jody  is  one  of the highlights of this mag,  and  has  been 
writing  for us as well,  with probably the most overdeveloped sense of 
humour since...   ...Well, we got on the job!

Other  sections  also come in strongly,  Martin Wilsons Falcon  section 
has  its  own distinctive content and style,  touching on such  diverse 
topics  as  classic  ST  games that work on  the  '030,  through  to  a 
recommended art package for a certain Dr Fu Manchu and his army of  the 
damned! 

Steve Moore's Assembly section has a little bit of assembly,  and quite 
a lot of rant!,  He also suitably demolishes a sub-standard PlayStation 
game as head of the consoles section as well.. 

Nev's music column is a relative newcomer,  but packed with reviews and 
a  usefully  running Protracker tutorial,  all in a  breezin'  booyakka 
style, according to Jody..

Tony  Greenwood  weighs in with a useful piece on PC  emulators,  other 
topics  include  a very hefty 'history of computers' that  goes  almost 
back  to when mankind first started to bang rocks together to learn  to 
count,  there are several reviews of a pd'ish nature in there as well.. 
With  other  articles  still not accounted  for,  various  adverts  for 
commercial  and  non-commercial  outfits  alike,  and  the  usual  vain 
editorial  attempts at damage limitation taking place,  this issue tops 
out at around sixty-odd articles.. Which is pretty good..

To  go  on  any  more is to deny you the pleasure  of  reading  it  for 
yourself.  If  you  are  the kind of diskmag fan who does not  mind  if 
a publication is not on first name terms with all the demo crews,  then 
get a copy and enjoy..

Summary..  A nice STOS-based Custom shell.. Comes on one D/S disk.. now 
*fully* Falcon fixed and runs from hard disk..  Articles,  a mixture of 
styles but of high quality throughout..  Prospects,  fantastic, as long 
as they don't get 'same time every bloody month' fatigue..

Overall, a resounding eight and a half out of ten!


                          Undercover Issue 8

Eric  and  the  boys are back with a new issue  of  Undercover  mag,  a 
diskzine  thought previously to have died some time ago..  Happily  for 
us,   it  is  anything  but,  and  we  are  even  promised  a  possible 
Siliconvention  special issue,  almost 'live' from the show..  However, 
this   new   regular  issue  has  presented  itself  to  us   for   our 
consideration..  

Looking at it on one level,  issue eight is more of issue seven,  which 
is not a bad thing in itself..  The shell design remains the same,  and 
is  the definitive and final (apart from debugging) version..  This  is 
intended  to  consciously get away from the legacy  of  previous  menus 
which were claimed by many to be too close to the old style Diskbusters 
layout..  We do get a nice intro to kick off with,  which works on both 
ST  and  Falcon,  and tends to run a bit smoother on the  Falcon..  The 
highlight  is  an  ST-based fiery plasma vector cube,  supported  by  a 
classy  looking  rotate n' zoom,  and some superb still graphics..  The 
music  is  by that soundchip wizard,  Tao of Cream..  The main shell is 
still slightly buggy,  giving problems on leaving it particularly, so a 
reset tends to be advisable..

Into the main menu,  and a vast choice confronts you.. Start at the top 
with  a slightly confusing editorial,  which details the many movements 
and problems of the Undercover team over the past few months.. Skimming 
through  the  credits  and greets section (thanks!) we  alight  on  the 
'scene news' section, where the movements of the various demo crews are 
described  in  detail..  There  has been a house  clearing  session  in 
progress,  so a lot of inactive groups have been taken out, which thins 
the  field somewhat from issue seven,  but there is still a lot to take 
in..  Most  usefully,  we learn of likely Siliconvention entries to the 
demo competition,  with what looks like a more heavywight field than we 
initially  expected..  Most  of  the other news is very up to  date  in 
comparison  with  issue  seven,  where it was spread over a  period  of 
several months..

There  is  some  input  from parts of  the  Maggie  Team,  with  strong 
contributions  by  Kev 'Taff' Davies,  Tat supplying an interview  file 
with some interesting views, and even yours truly carelessly lobbing in 
a couple of articles as well.. That blot aside, there are several other 
reviews  and previews of demos and games,  the games tend to fall  into 
three  impressive  ones,  and  the rest mediocre,  and the demos  don't 
really  show  off anything too inspiring,  apart from  one  interesting 
relic  from the olden days,  the 3.5K Megademo made up of 3.5k  screens 
from some of the classic crews..

There  is  quite a large music reviews section,  a big German  language 
section  that  could loosely be termed 'Craptalk',  and something  else 
that brings back memories from the Delta Force era of Maggie, that will 
ensure  that  it is not distributed by the likes of Goodmans  and  co.. 
Yes,  a reborn 'Adult' section lurks at the bottom of the menu,  a take 
it or leave it affair, better left where it is..

Well then,  a great read for those of us interested in the movements of 
the  demo coding and games scene..  There is still quite a lot going on 
out there, it is just a question of getting people to come out of their 
shells to tell us about it, and Undercover does a particularly good job 
of  that..  The quality of written english from Eric is pretty good  as 
well,  if  not up there with Richard Karsmakers,  who is a hard act for 
even  most  English  people  to  follow!  Information  in  the  mag  is 
plentiful, and reading it left you wanting more, which is always a good 
sign..

Summary:-  Assembly coded custom shell with a few bugs left in..  Comes 
on  one  D/S  disk..   Fully Falcon compatible,  and  music  enhanced.. 
Articles  informative  about the demo scene,  some articles in  German, 
some others best left alone!!  Prospects,  pretty good, as long as they 
can keep it up, and 'scene' activity remains at a semi-decent level..

Overall, we say eight out of ten..


         Diskmag news and dodgy rumours about the opposition!

A tiny bit late..

Atariphile issue 5, should have been with us mid-February, hopefully by 
the end of March?

- Update - 

Early April - Atariphile is now out..
 

A wee bit dead..

Kelstar  have  stopped production as Bob Kell is concentrating  on  his 
user  group..  The  main  method of members contacting  each  other  is 
apparently  to involve a version of his diskmag shell with each  others 
details on it.. 

However, the main mag is no more.. Credit where it is due to ST Highway 
issue four for carrying the news first,  but we were not sure initially 
whether  this  was for real,  or a reporting of the  premature  closure 
rumour  that got out at the end of last year before the last  issue  of 
Kelstar was released..

This is regrettable, but on the other hand, Bob may well have been wise 
to  quit whilst he was ahead,  as there was just the tiniest sense that 
they  might  have run out of ideas,  and would have  started  repeating 
themselves with progressively less force, as further issues went on..


A little bit of good news!

A  new  diskmag  is starting up very shortly,  details of the  new  mag 
called 'STunned' are very thin on the ground at the moment,  and we are 
getting more information urgently..  Issue one,  due out for the 1st of 
May  will feature yet another interview with yours truly,  which is  as 
good a reason for staying away as any, I suppose!

Seriously though, more here as soon as we get it..


And a bit more..

Undercover issue 8 was released in Mid-March to a keenly waiting world, 
a full review can be found earlier in this column.. The Undercover team 
should  also  hopefully  be  doing  a  Siliconvention  special   issue, 
including  a realtime article,  various interviews with people  present 
there, and all the latest news, reviews, and rumours from the event..

*Update*  - Siliconvention special now released,  a compact little read 
with a realtime article, news and reviews from the event.


Yes, more of that good news stuff still to share with you all!

John Weller,  ex-STen co-editor and Atari veteran has recently got back 
in  contact  with  us..  We learn that he is still very much  an  Atari 
person, and it was a chance remark in a review in issue 21 that set him 
writing to us after a gap of three years or so.. The upshot is, that he 
is  now  producing  a  regular  column  for  ST+,   and  will  be  also 
contributing to Maggie as well.. Not a bad result, all told!


One slightly dodgy one?

There has been some suggestion made that the 'Morpheus Rant' styled  as 
'Room 101' in the above reviewed issue of ST Highway, may not have been 
by him after all? This had some rather strongly expressed viewpoints on 
certain  subjects including the situation in N.Ireland,  and condemning 
large sections of society out of hand..  "I'm innocent,  I was set up!" 
is the cry coming from Morpheus HQ, as the angry letters flood in.. 

If it wasn't him,  who is the real culprit?
 
The  style of this rant,  brings back memories of some of the 'Mad Ron' 
pieces in the late Kelstar Diskmag?

More info on this one needed, any volunteers?


One possibly related to the one above??

ST  Highway is undergoing an editor change..  We are denied the talents 
of Jake Nicholls for future issues as other commitments eat rather  too 
heavily  into his time..  The new editor is someone previously unknown, 
but lives 'North of the Border'.. 

The next issue of ST Highway is due out in Mid-April..


Stosser to give up umpteenth attempt at being 'Undead'??

Stosser  may  be  ready to call it a day,  issue 29 being  their  final 
issue..  Yet more editor exhaustion may be the cause, and there is some 
suggestion  that  one of the founders,  Tony Greenwood,  may not be too 
happy  with the direction the magazine is going in,  and has discreetly 
suggested the plug be pulled..
 

Warp in to Atari Shows on Impulse?

The  very  long  delayed  Warp Issue six  may  finally  appear  at  the 
Birmingham Atari Show at the end of April?  However,  Keefy has come up 
with a new potential distraction, a PD library.. We'll have to wait and 
see if the magazine does show after all.. (It Didn't!)


**Stop Press!!**

Fun Magazine now out!!  Hot from channel Atari IRC, where Wingleader of 
Synergy gave out the URL to download the mag from. More next issue!

We've also heard that ST Highway issue 6 is now out, and apparently has 
undergone  a  major revamp with the recent change in editor..  More  on 
this one next time as well..
