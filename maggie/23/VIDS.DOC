Near Dark
---------

Bit of an underrated  classic  this  one,  and  the  film that inspired
Quentin Tarantino's "Dusk 'til Dawn". So naturally  it is a modern day
vampire flick. Here is a quick run down on the plot.

Caleb is a small town  country  boy  (you  know, the ranchers brigade,
country music listenin', beer drinkin'  type).  Anyway his hormones do
their thing and he  ends  up  playing  tonsil  tennis  with Mae, a not
unattractive newcomer, and wouldn't you just  know it she's a vampire
(vampyr?). Naturally she bites him (for the  sake of the  plot) and he
becomes a vamp. Caleb ends up with a group of modern day vampires on a
killing spree across America.

This is a pretty good  light  horror  to  be fair, however the effects
vary in quality. Some are first rate (particularly the bar scene), and
some although good at the time are, well to be fair a little below par
(or should that  be  above  par ..erm.. you  know, below average). The
quality of the acting is pretty good with a solid performance given by
all, although the cast is a spot  those who were in "Alien" films line
up which detracts slightly from your enjoyment of the film itself.

In conclusion a good solid  vampire  movie  which  is a welcome relief
from the gothic style of film, good move.

Pump Up The Volume
------------------

Becoming a bit of a must see in  my little corner of the universe, and
is one of those teen movies you  can  watch  again and again in a very
Heathers-esque kinda way, after all  Christian  Slater has the leading
role.

Slater plays Mark Hunter a painfully  shy new-kid-in-town but at night 
he becomes 'Happy Harry Hard On' pirate  DJ extraordinare, with a name
like that you can expect the masturbation jokes to fly and indeed they
do. Naturally the corrupt headmistress  and  the parents at the school
are a little pissed off with Harry  as  he starts to slowly expose the
corruption that goes on  at  the  school.  Naturally  there  is a love
interest in the  form  of Samantha  Mathis (coincidentally  Mathis and
Slater star side by side  in  the  more recent "Broken Arrow", Slaters
first break into the BIG time. Naturally  I  don't want to give up to
much of the plot  but that was a brief outline.

 Slater is really on form, doing  a Robin William's Adrian Cronauer in
smallsville USA. His monologues on  Sex, love, and rock'n'roll are
totally hilarious and at times  a  little  moving, naturally Slater is
using his slightly insane eyes to add that little bit of AAaaaaaaaghhh
to his performance, top stuff.

 A totally compelling film  which  is  hilarious  as  well as having a
message, probably one of Slater's best performances to date.
