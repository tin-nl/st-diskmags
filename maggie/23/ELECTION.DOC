                       -* A Maggie Production *-

Dateline 17th March..

Oh happy happy, joy joy, we've just been told the kick-off date for the 
general election,  which happens to be May 1st..  Fasten your seatbelts 
for six weeks of unmitigated tedium...

This is the Maggie Election Scrapbook, a slowly building  up  textfile
with  the  more  bizarre manifestations of election madness and people 
speaking without checking up with their brain to make sure that it was
safe first.. Thankfully,  it  is  not  a regular guide to  the  General 
Election, as there's too much of the real thing out there, and we don't 
want you all nodding off by the end of the article..

Anyway, even after this first week, a few things to kick off with.. 


                             -*Item One*-

By a spooky coincidence, our local member of Parliament (MP) has thrown 
his hat in the ring,  or rather,  on my doorstep,  as the first of many 
pieces of political junkmail marked 'Dear Constituent' arrives..

Sir  Peter  Fry (Conservative,  semi-decent majority last time  around) 
emphasises  his  reactionary old Right Wing Tory  duffer  credentials.. 

He's  tough on crime,  would have a punch up with anyone opposing grant 
maintained  schools,  and  is frankly a bit of a  Eurosceptic..  Rather 
foolishly, he leaves contact addresses and phone numbers on there.. The 
rest  of the letter is there to demonstrate his record as far as  local 
issues  are  concerned,  which  is  basically bits  and  bobs  of  road 
building, and getting those naughty gipsies of someone else's land..

Pretty uninspiring lowbrow back bencher material then..  Let's see what 
the rest have to say for themselves..


                             -*Item Two*-

Sunday the 23rd of March

Well,  this General Election lark is  shaping up  into a  really groovy 
laugh.. Take today, the Sunday  Mirror, in its infinite wisdom, decided
that the  opinion polls  were  all wrong,  and decided to let loose the
crystal bollocks merchants. Surprisingly for such prognostically gifted
people, they all  came up with very different stories, here are some of
the  more inexplicable accounts..

'The Crystal Poll' - Forget the politicians, they all say they're going 
to win. Forget the opinion polls, they got it badly wrong last time. So 
CAROLINE  SUTTON  asked  Britain's  top  psychics  for  their  election 
predictions...

   _O_ 
  /(_)\  Russell Grant, a chubby beaming camp little tosser
   | |   

"John  Major  will  lose because he didn't call an April  poll.  As  an 
Aries, he should have gone for an April 10 election."

"Everything  he PM does is hampered by a partial elipse of the  sun  in 
March.  This means he will experience a life-changing event.  Perhaps a 
fundamental change in his professional life."

"But for Tony Blair,  a Taurus,  the stars are shining bright for a May 
victory."

(Ah,  so it's nothing to do with the previous record of the government, 
or  the  Conservatives  fatal split on Europe,  or  even  Tony  Blair's 
abilities as party leader to put a half-decent team together, it is all 
in the stars, according to the soft-voiced twat!) 
 

Next up, Craig Hamilton Parker predicts;

"A  Labour  politician is caught drink-driving.  A Tory is  accused  of 
hypocrisy by the single mother who has his child." 

(Well  that's  enough of how they behave when they're at work,  but  it 
tells us nothing new about the election!)


Jane  Hamilton-Parker (probably related to the above) scares the  pants 
off me with the following;

"The Conservatives win by a large majority. Mrs Thatcher will return to 
the government in a powerful role."

(Urrgh!)


Finally, this most brilliant remark  in  the middle of a whole  lot  of 
other  unremarkable  gumpf,   which must  have been missed by the proof 
readers,   was  by  Betty  Palko,   whose  advice  also helped to  send 
Princess Diana around the twist..

"During  the campaign,  there will be a bizarre incident with a dog.  I 
don't know any more than that."

(Fwibble!!)
   
Well, with the leading lights in the astrological community on the job, 
we  now know we're in safe hands,  albeit ones that aren't really quite 
there with the plot! 


                            -*Item Three*-

The week before..

The  Sun  newspaper declares its support for Tony Blair..  At the  same 
time,  he  reverses  previous  Labour policy to restrict  ownership  of 
national newspapers by Rupert Murdoch.. Coincidence?? Surely not!!


                             -*Item Four*-


Saturday the 22nd March

It's Labour getting the stick again, as one obscure genius of a sitting 
MP,  the representative for Hull, decides to go out with no campaign at 
all! 

"The common aim is to get rid of the present government,  so it doesn't 
matter  what  we  set out to do..  When someone asks me what  a  Labour 
government intends to do, I say 'nothing', as it doesn't matter!"

It  is  thought that the MP concerned will start inbreeding  with  that 
well-known  Tory  madwoman representing Billericay,  Teresa Gorman,  to 
produce a race of utterly radiation damaged DNA deformed mutants!


                              -*Item???*-

The  second week of campaigning did not live up to the promise  of  the 
first, needless to say.. Instead of more mad psychics and head the ball 
in  the wrong direction quotes from sitting MP's who should have  known 
when to keep their gobs tightly shut,  we got a whole week of some Tory 
shagging a seventeen year old shopgirl or something..(*) Frankly,  both 
of them should have known better! 

(*)This  whole  concept is a lot less stimulating than it  first  might 
sound to our non-UK readers!


                             -*Item Five*-

The  third  week of this general farce started quietly enough,  with  a 
break  for  the Easter hols to let people take a  breath  to  recover.. 
However,  by  midweek,  it's  too  good to be left alone as the  Tories 
unveil their latest and greatest secret weapon..

They  have  hired an actor in a chicken costume to  follow  Tony  Blair 
around,  the inference is,  that he is too 'chicken' to get into a live 
television debate with John Major! - A tough one to follow that, but we 
might suggest people dressed up in pantomime mad cow costumes to  annoy 
the  dickens out of Douglas Hogg (failed agricultural  minister..)  The 
cows  should  have  a  built-in rabies foam  dripper  and  move  around 
inexpertly  on  roller skates to simulate the more public  symptoms  of 
BSE.. Laugh? We all will!

The  actor  playing the chicken was later seen having lunch  with  Tony 
Blair..  Any rumours of a defection to Labour were quashed as the actor 
in question,  when asked about his political views,  said that he hated 
all of them!

                             -*Item Six*-

It's  manifesto  time during the third week as well,  as all the  major 
parties put their bottoms on the line, and say "Kick me, go on, do your 
worst!"  in  vague  and waffly upbeat language,  wrapped  in  expensive 
glossy paper..

So far,  I'v only seen the Tory one in the shops.. Initial expectations 
that  it is a free hand-out turn to ashes as there is a discreet 2  ukp 
charge on the back.. 

I  flip through the contents and realise that I'm not going to  miss  a 
lot..  All annoyingly upbeat and just pure PR bumf.. A few things stick 
out in the memory though..

'We will continue with the successful privatisation of the railways..'

  -  You  mean we're going to get  more  driverless  and  passengerless 
     trains?!

Something   about   keeping  up  anti-rabies  laws,   but  looking   at 
alternatives to quarantine of animals in there as well..

  -  So the innecessant lobbying of the government by rich  people  who 
     take their yappy toy dogs on holiday abroad has paid off at last?

"Whoo-ahh! Let's keep this Federal Europe thing at arms length!"

 -  My Words by the way,  brevity being the soul of wit and all, and it 
    saves three pages worth of their gumf splattering your brains..

And then, err, errm, it's so grey and featureless, I can't remember any 
more. hang on, wait a minute,

"Britain is the best place to live in the world!" 

 -  Sorry,  we're gonna need some serious persuading!  - Not the worst,     
    like  some other people always think, but definitely not the  best     
    either..


                            -*Item Seven*-

A hairy couple of days for Tony Blair who wanted to turn Scotland  into 
a  parish council,  or give them a Parliament that had roughly the same 
powers as one, or something.. 

The Scots didn't like that one very much..

They're not happy with him..


                            -*Item Eight*-

The junkmailers have been active again,  as it is the Labour candidates 
turn to drop something through my letterbox.. 

We  learn that Paul Stinchcombe is aged 34,  had humble beginnings in a 
council  house,  but  became a Barrister specialising in  environmental 
law..  His hobbies include speechwriting for Tony Blair,  being married 
to a wife called Suzanne,  and having three young children, and he also 
went to Cambridge and Harvard Law school..

His set piece is fairly standard stuff,  but the impression I get is of 
a systematic high-flier who carefully works in just that little bit  of 
human   interest   to  avoid  looking  totally,   a  cold   machinelike 
overachiever  of the sort that has 'New Labour' stamped all  over   the 
casing.. 

In  short,  he sounds like the sort of smug git who has been working on 
his curriculum vitae since he was twelve.. 

I loathe him already!


                             -*Item Nine*-

A leap onto the blandwagon?

Labour  and Lib-Dem manifestos have been seen in the shops today..  The 
Labour effort hails for a  very slightly cheaper than the Tories œ1.99, 
which  probably  sums  up how they'll be in government,  that  is  very 
slightly cheaper than the Tories..  The Lib-Dems are coy about how much 
their overstuffed pamphlet costs,  which again probably is a good guide 
to  their probable performance in power,  ie.  they'll keep quiet about 
how much it really all costs..

Both   the  opposition  efforts  are  stuffed  with  the   same   bland 
reassurances  of  the Tory effort.  The Lib-Dem effort is  notable  for 
being  less glossy and more brownbeat,  as if stylistically going  back 
ten  years or more to seek a notably beige good cause to  pester..  The 
Labour  one  features  soundbites of the  great  leader  and  celestial 
helmsman,  Tony Blair fixed into print..  Yes, he even does that "Tough 
on  crime,  tough  on  the causes of crime" effort in writing  for  our 
benefit..


                             -*Item Ten*-

Margaret Thatcher sums up how a lot of people are feeling at this point 
when  she says that a three week campaign is enough,  and that this six 
week drag is too long.. People get bored! 

Now  why  is  she  getting wise *after* she's  not  in  a  position  to 
influence events anymore!?


                            -*Item Eleven*-

There  are  some unlikely people floating around to try  to  break  the 
three  party  blandness  that  is  permeating  this  whole   election.. 
Unfortunately,  one  of these happens to be Sir James Goldsmith and his 
Referendum party..

He  got  a whole election broadcast to himself tonight,  and we  got  a 
distrustful,  scornful,  teeth  flashing  at the whole Brussels imposed 
nightmare  called  the European Union styled  performance..  You  could 
almost  see him silently mouthing the words "Britons never NEVER  shall 
be slaves!"

It  is  interesting to note that he also sponsors a  rather  more  pro-
European  Union political party in France,  and generally seems to  get 
around  different countries a lot,  with a slightly different view  for 
each  of  them on a given topic..  Jimmy Goldsmith seems to be  one  of 
these  corporate people who would change nationality for  tax  reasons, 
and will probably drop the Referendum Party if it wildly  underperforms 
at the election..

Anyway,  whatever you might think of the proper political parties, give 
this lot a miss, they've got nothing to say..


                            -*Item Twelve*-

The  big  news in this otherwise slack fourth week of  campaigning  has 
been  the  latest intelligent poster designed to appeal to  the  higher 
moral  and  intellectual instincts of the British people,  which  shows 
Tony  Blair  (the  Labour leader,  remember?) sitting on  the  knee  of 
Germany's Helmut Kohl ventriloquist dummy style..

This ploy to steal the potential referendum party vote (see last  item) 
was given to us courtesy of the Tories..


                           -*Item Thirteen*-

 Almost home..

All sides seem to have opted for name-calling to substitute for serious 
debate.. This is the flipside of the overly optimistic manifestos which 
promise  heaven  on  earth,  saying  that their  opponents  will  wreck 
everything that you hold dear,  boil down your household pets for glue 
etc..

That  is  why  I've  not  been too busy  on  this  lately,  other  more 
interesting  things  have been happening closer to  home  (Atari  Show) 
which  have  taken  up most of my spare time..  However,  this gem  for 
collectors of Website trivia..

     "More evidence of anti Tory bias emerged at the BBC whose election 
     site  on  the world wide web gives the following address  for  the 
     Conservatives manifesto: 'conman.html'"".
       (Private Eye - 15th April)  

More soon, on and after the election day itself, which is only a couple 
of days from now..


                           -*Item Fourteen*-

A  couple of prize excerpts to finish with on the last day  before  the 
election..

To Tony Blair by a disgruntled voter..

"You're  just  a plastic Tory.  Why should I vote for a dummy if I  can 
vote for the real thing?"

But  this more encouraging piece from an elderly voter in  Norwich  who 
was  always a Labour voter,  but he was a bit concerned about this Euro 
thing,

"I'm  an  antiseptic,  and that Mr Blair knows what he must do when  he 
sees those Germans!"


More about what actually happened in a couple of days time then!


                           -*Item Fifteen*-

And what a night!!

Labour  win  by a huge margin,  and it appears that their 'Time  for  a 
change' message,  or more likely,  the Tories making a complete arse of 
their campaign and prospects for government got through to people.. 

Almost  everyone  decided that John Major needed a lie  down  and  rest 
after his "A soundbite never buttered a parsnip" comment..   Many other 
top  Tories showed their tiredness on the election night  itself,  with 
David  Mellor  and  his appeal to (Sir) James Goldsmith  of  the  loony 
Referendum  Party to piss off back to Mexico if he thought he was  hard 
enough..

Best of all was the comment from defeated ex-defence minister and  full 
time oily creep,  Michael Portillo, who was heard to utter the defining 
comment on his decline "Bugger me,  they sussed us out at last, I'm off 
for a port and lemon with a grapefruit wrapped round the glass! Do they 
still  do face changing plastic surgery and false identities  in  South 
America by the way?"

Finally,  the  last  word has to be from Dr Brian Mawhinney,  the  Tory 
Party  chairman  who  said "You made that last one up  CiH,  you'll  be 
hunted down like the viciously apolitical vermin you are, grrr!"  


            -*But what did you do in the election Daddy?*-

But how did you vote CiH?  I hear you ask..  Well,  out of a previously 
described  uninspiring  lineup,  I  decided  on  the  least  irritating 
candidate,  It  turned out to be the Liberal Democrat candidate who had 
send not one piece of junk mail, and so happily kept himself an unknown 
quantity to my critical eyes.. It still didn't do him any good however.


                             -* End Bit *-

         (Written long before anything else, funnily enough!)

Don't  forget!  A  politician is by definition,  a person who was  last 
completely honest with themselves about thirty years ago..


 CiH, election fever is not an issue here, and never was really in 1997
