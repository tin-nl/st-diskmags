
               - Mama Mia! It's the Maggie Team again! -  

              Heavens Gate, the Ideal Utils corner club!

This  time,   a slightly tongue in cheek approach to the sort of things 
they would like to see on their STs and Falcons..

CiH.. A very simple request, a *working* Falcon would be nice.. (sigh!)
(Early May update - Now got!)

Mr  Pink..  Wants to do a N64 Emulator,  which can run the games from a 
bog-standard Falcon..  These will be soon apparently available as image 
files from the Internet, which sounds a bit naughty to me!

(Now  CiH  has  got his Falcon back,  it seems the curse of  the  wonky 
upgrade has been passed on to Mr Pink as his Falcon sits in Purgatory's 
waiting room (actually, TUS) waiting to be fixed!!)  

Tat..  The  new  king of demo coding could score himself  some  massive 
video capture gear to record his demos,  then convert the video data to 
a massive .AVI file to taunt PC owners with a "Look what you're missing 
you blind fools!" styled rant..

Tash..  Hard  to  think of one for her..  Maybe a mains driven electric 
fence  around her gear to stop a crazed Mr Pink using it when he  sends 
his Falcon away to get Nemesis fitted to it..

Kev  Dempsey..  A  random fractal generator recoded to do random  Manga 
Babes instead..

Kev  Davies..  We  though  he was okay,  but the other day he  murmured 
something  about a tower case through a dribbly mouth..  I thought  the 
electric shock therapy had sorted it all out?? 

Ed Cleveland.. A Scouse to English dictionary desk accessory would suit 
this man a treat..

Jody  Smith..  A  special  kind of modem for this  chap..  It  uploads, 
downloads,  websurfs  and  every  so often,  rings up someone to  sling 
random abuse at them.. "See that fax machine you've got, that's a puffs 
drink that is!!!"

Felice.. Wants someone to come up with a 'Bud the Chud' level editor!

                              ----------

Grateful forms of gratitude also rendered to the following bodies...

Dave Escott and all at The Upgrade Shop (TUS) for digging my Falcon out 
of  a very large hole,  fitting Nemesis as if nothing had actually gone 
wrong, and for being all-round authentic reasonably priced dudes!

John Hayward for article donation.. Nice to see a revamped ST Highway..

MSG, we won't forget the Reservoir Gods Maison Page..

Dave  Hollis  for helping to revive my old 'FM,  and for the loan of  a 
better machine (STe) during the crisis period.. 

Dave  Weller,  if  anyone  said three years ago you'd  be  writing  for 
Maggie, you would have killed them on the spot!

Pieter van der Meer for talking to us about himself for this issue..

Jaguar  Explorer  Online  (JEO),  for  'loan' of  the  Matthew  Gosling 
interview..

Richard  Karsmakers,  who let's face it,  cannot keep away from writing 
for too long..

                              ----------

Consider your existence acknowledged..

All  groups and people at the Siliconvention for a really  good  effort 
this time!  With special mentions for Shadows (cool demo,  just needs a 
bit  of  DSP code now),  TSCC,  Avena (oh,  you mean that Tat fellow as 
well?)  Escape  (For producing one of the most  difficult  to  describe 
demos ever!) TNB,  Lazer, who might do another demo if we're very good, 
NoCrew,  Inter,  Therapy (nice demo too, but where's the second half of 
it?) and all..

All  people  at  the Atari Shows,  especially Matt  Smith,  Tronic  and 
gorgeous sister,  Mike Goodman, Keefy, Pete Augustin who came down with 
Dave,  Steve Delaney, Dave Encill and Dave Murphy, Karl "Keep the noise 
down" Brandt,  the Atari Computing Magazine team,  Steve Moore, Paz and 
Bun..

Stax or RDT developments for persevering with 'Running'..

New Beat Developments, likewise for 'Willy the Adventurer'..

John  Thompson,  when are we going to see the first issue of 'STunned'? 
Did you get my interview text?

Eric and the Undercover Diskmag team for reappearing..

Sebastian and Gerald, two of our most diligent readers!

All at WAG..

Bonus and the rest of the 'Fun' team..

Tony  Greenwood and Stosser Soft for giving us something new to  review 
for each recent issue of Maggie..

The rest of the ST+ Team not so far greeted or credited here..

Sorry, ran out of breath..

Bye for now..

 CiH, May '97..
