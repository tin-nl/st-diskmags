
This  is  an  early  synopsis of a book in  preparation  by  the  Atari 
Computing Team..  Felice has some involvement in this project as well.. 
This  is  intended to provide a 'beginners' guide to  the  Atari,  with 
reference  to  current  market  conditions,   the  commercial,  PD  and 
shareware scenes, and may well include some useful information even for 
the more experienced among us.. 

Little note from Felice ...

I'm  actually  writing  the book now as we speak ...  so it  should  be 
available in the printed format in late summer. Watch the October Atari 
Shows, where the book should be on sale from the AC stand .... and will 
also be available in Canada, via Computer Direct, and via Toad.

                      Working Title: Ataris for Dummies 
 
General:

The  book  will  be  written in  an  informative,   sometimes  amusing,   
manner,   in a  similar style to Ed Krol's book,   'The Whole Internet' 
published by O'Reilly  &   Associates.

Possibility of technical parts of book being highlighted so that  those 
who  are   not  interested  in eg,   the explanation of SCSI  can  skip  
that   bit.   This  is   similar  to a style used in the 'for  Dummies' 
series of books by IDG  media  -  maybe  it is  worth checking with IDG 
just  to see if they might be  interested  in  running  the book   with 
the  above title.   

The book should ideally  try  to  cover the global Atari market  as  it 
exists in,  for example,  Canada and the US  -  Atari books in the past 
have tended only  to concentrate on  British  based  products only.  In 
the   light  of  the  success  of   Computer  Direct,   Toad  and  Best  
Electronics, this could be a possibility.
 
1.  Preface 

basic   introduction  to the book and what it is about  possibility  of 
history   of   Atari being described in fair detail,    including  most 
models  of ST,  Falcon and  C-Lab  Falcon X - pictures of older  models 
and history  check  obtainable  from  Best Electronics ??

Mention  of  Nolan  Bushnell  - founder of Atari  -  ownership  by  the  
Tramiel family  from 1983-4 

2.  Starting out 

Question:- Where do I obtain an Atari computer from ??

Choice  of where to buy Atari computers from buying from  bankrupt  box 
shifters  - such as those in Oxford St,  London buying from second hand 
electrical   stores   (eg   Cash   Convertors)   buying   from   police 
stolen/recovered   sales  in  UK  and  pawnbrokers  in   the  US &  Can 
ada  buying  from specialist  Atari  dealers  (eg   System   Solutions) 
details  of suppliers of Atari computers and peripherals   (eg   System  
Solutions,  T  itan) getting advice from local Atari groups (STAG  etc)  
list of Atari and compatible peripherals in glossary at end of book 

Question:- Why should I buy an Atari rather than the latest   whiz-bang 
PC ??

Atari computers,   whilst not being PC compatibles themselves,  do have  
programs  available that produce pictures,   sounds,   etc, that can be 
displayed  and used  on   other platforms (eg Apex Media - saves out as 
GIF's  that  can be  displayed   on PC and used in pages on  the  World 
Wide Web)  

3.   Setting  up  the Atari computer unpack  standard  520STFM  box  in 
detail,   describe actual  keyboard  and   the  various leads that come 
with  it,   identify each lead provided and plug it  into   the correct 
place  at  the back of the Atari,   identify the ports at the back   of  
the  machine   and describe what each one is used for  unpack  standard 
520STE  box  in detail,  highlighting the changes made  between the STE 
and  STFM,   despite  the   fact  that  both  machines  look  the  same  
externally  description  of the Falcon  in  the  same way  pictures  of 
backs of 3 machines (ST,  STE and Falcon)  obtainable  from  Best ??

Describe   how  to  use the Atari with a television  (the  most   basic   
setup),  plugging it all in, tuning the television to channel 36 to get 
correct picture.

Describe   what  a  monitor  is and why many people use  these   rather  
than   a  television  where to obtain monitors from - monitors to avoid  
(incompatibles),    where  to obtain leads - differences between colour 
and  mono monitors  describe  the floppy drive,   discs and how to keep 
them  in full working  order what kinds  of  DD-floppies to  avoid  and 
where to get drives from (TUS  etc)  General  do's  and dont's of using 
computers,  specifically  not  having   liquid or food  anywhere   near  
them,   never   let younger siblings or children insert   things   into  
the  ports, such as biscuits, etc 

4.  Switching on and using the Atari 

How   to   switch the machine on correctly,   how to use  the  Language

discs,     changing     resolution  (low/medium/high)  explaining   the 
functions of all  menus on  desktop  Explain  possible  problems   that 
can  occur  and  solutions  with  keyboard   and   mouse   (eg    mouse  
directions  reversed  due  to Ghost virus,   keyboard  clicks  due   to  
object   resting on keyboard). Explain possible problems with TV, ie no 
sound.

Possible   technical  part  dealing  with  problems   associated   with
