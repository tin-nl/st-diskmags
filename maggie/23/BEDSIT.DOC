Once upon a time,  when the world was young, we shared a four-bedroomed 
house  with  Liz's mother and sisters.  It was  a  comfortable,  almost 
suburban,  life  in  which the only the only hassles were the  ones  we 
created for ourselves.  But then the mortgage company told us that they 
were going to repossess the house within the next ten days.  We had 30 
in  the  bank,  29 animals to look after,  and not a hope  in  hell  of 
finding anywhere else to live.

Our  local Council had "no legal obligation whatsoever" towards us  and 
for a while it looked as we'd be living in our car.  But then I managed 
to  swing an unofficial overdraft (so unofficial that the  bank  didn't 
even  know  about it) and we moved into a one-room bedsit  in  a  large 
Victorian house in Lansdowne - the nightclub epicentre of  Bournemouth. 
We  settled in and got to know the other tenants.  And what  a  strange 
bunch we were...


                        ELVIS ON THE 1ST FLOOR

Peter  the Elvis impersonator lived on the floor below us and  used  to 
practice his repertoire from eight in the morning until eight at night. 
Loudly,  with a full PA system and backing tapes.  He was an  incurable 
optimist  who honestly believed that at any moment he was going  to  be 
signed up for a major recording contract, and whisked away to a life of 
unimaginable  luxury.  He couldn't sing or carry a tune,  but that  was 
beside  the point;  Peter was born to be an entertainer,  and the  show 
must go on!

He lived in a fantasy world that glossed over all the hassles and petty 
details  of everyday life.  It honestly never occured to him  that  his 
neighbours  might get irritated at hearing Wooden Heart played at  full 
volume for the twentieth time.

At other times he told us about his cottage in the South of France  (he 
couldn't live there because of "some difficulty with the local taxes"), 
and his recording contract in Paris. We translated the photocopied form 
letter  for  him:  "Monsieur,  we  listened to  your  tape  with  great 
interest,  but  are unable to help you at present.  However you may  be 
interested in the range of services and training that we offer..."  For 
Peter this translated as "Yes, full contract to follow!"

He  busked when he wasn't practising,  and sang in karaoke pubs in  the 
evenings.  He  always had new clothes (suede  winkle-picker  boots,  no 
less!)  and we thought he was at least getting by,  until we found  out 
that everything he owned had been bought on credit.  The last we saw of 
him was when he did a moonlight flit just ahead of the Bailiffs.


                          TESSIE IN THE ATTIC

Theresa,  on the other hand,  was a nasty piece of work. She moved into 
the attic when Johnny - the local dealer - moved out and took his  band 
rehearsals  with him.  We didn't mind those - at least the  bongos  and 
trumpet  were  professional - but Tessie's screaming matches  were  the 
worst kind of amateurism.  Picture the scene;  it's two in the morning, 
and she's shouting from the third floor to the street:

Fark  orf  ya little kunt!  I don't wanna farking  see  you  again,  ya 
farking barstard!  Fark orf,  farkof!  Farkof!  FARKORF awt of it -  ya 
farking little kunt! 

Eh?  Too good fer me naw are yer?  Well,  you'll regret it yer will, ya 
farking tart!  I'm telling ya,  you'll farking regret it you will!

You  fark orf or I'll get one o' me mates to blow ya farking face  orf, 
ya farking kunt!

Ahhh,  'it the farking big time naw 'ave we?  Mixing with the 'eavy mob 
naw  are we?  Stupid farking bitch!  And what about me  farking  stereo 
then? Yer not farking 'avin' that!

Awww, want yer farking stereo do yer... Well 'ere's yer farking stereo! 

KRRRAAASSSHH!!!

You  wouldn't  have thought that a sixteen year-old girlie  could  have 
made so much noise. But she did, and regularly, one way or another.

Then  along  came  Chris,  an  older boyfriend who  dolled  her  up  in 
stilettos and black stockings.  Chris wasn't much to look at -  30'ish, 
plug ugly and balding - but he could fuck like a stallion.  How did  we 
know that?  Were we listening at the keyhole? No, we didn't need to; we 
could hear them through the floor, in the hall, 
and halfway down the street.

The  first night we heard them,  directly over our  heads,  we  thought 
someone was sawing timber up there - EeeeRahhhh! EeeeRahhh!  - until we 
heard  Tessie's   moans and yelps and realised that both  she  and  the 
bedsprings were getting a work-out.

Oooh!  Ooooh!  OooooH!  OH! AH! OH! Oh!Oh!Oh!Oh! Arrrghhh! RrawW! Ungh! 
AH! AH! Yes! AAAAAA-AHHHHH!

But  we had our revenge when they bugged us so much one night  that  we 
responded in kind: Yes! Go on, Chris, you can do it! Give her one! Yes, 
that's  it!  Nice one mate!  Followed by the yowling screams that  cats 
make when they're mating. I've never heard a couple go so quiet, and so 
quickly, as that night.


                        NEEDLES IN THE BASEMENT

Mike  in the basement was an old-time junkie with a 12-year  habit.  He 
was a nice enough guy but we didn't have much in common; he was either 
scoring, on the nod, or watching TV.

Oh, I do like my telly, I don't know what I'd do without my telly...

Mike would call in for a chat occasionally,  but then Jason,  Adey  and 
Steve moved into the house and our room turned into a social centre for 
the town's junkie community.  Now don't get me wrong - I've got nothing 
against  junkies  - but they're  hardly  stimulating  company.  They're 
either on the nod, on the scrounge, or putting down roots on your sofa.

Adey made jewellery and played the didgeridoo,  but Jason's only talent 
was  for playing the fool.  And as for Steve,  well,  I've  had  better 
conversations  with brick walls.  It wasn't that he was  uninteresting, 
just on the nod all the time. On a bad day it could take him an hour to 
finish a sentence.

That  period has come to an end and we're glad to see the back  of  it. 
Bedsits  are an adventure when you're in your teens and  twenties,  but 
when you get to our age, they're just sordid.
