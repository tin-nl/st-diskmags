As you will see from the following press release,  many new things have 
been  happening at Titan Designs and Black Scorpion Software  over  the 
last two months...

----------------- 
WEBSITE DOWNLOADS 
----------------- 

Our  Titan/BSS  homepage  is  currently  being  redesigned  for  easier 
navigation between the Titan,  BSS and Gribnif pages. This has resulted 
in a totally new look when you first access the site - we hope you like 
it! Navigation from the homepage is primarily by icons only, so if this 
does cause a problem please let us know.

Now  you can download any of Titan Designs' or Black  Scorpion's  files 
directly  from  our  Website.  These include new  updates  to  existing 
software,  sample images,  demos and the entire range of free software; 
FalCAM Tripod, MC68040 Toolkit, Nemesis, APEX Viewers, etc.

It  is intended that all the Gribnif demos and upgrade patches will  be 
included  in  the near future,  either directly from our pages  of  via 
links to the official Gribnif site.

In addition you can also access files directly from the Black  Scorpion 
sites;

----------------- 
THOUGHT! 
----------------- 

The incredible Thought! Ideas Processor v2.2 is now only #49.95!

We  have  always  said that Thought!  is the ultimate  development  and 
productivity tool for anyone who develops anything on an Atari - and we 
still stand by this statement!

An incredibly powerful tool,  Thought!  can assist with the development 
of ideas in a graphical format,  that can easily be changed and edited. 
Thought!  is so advanced that even PC productivity programs do not even 
come close to the power offered by Thought!

Thought!  is  not  just  for  programmers.  Anyone,  from musicians  to 
writers, can really see a difference in the way their productivity will 
increase. Even if you don't use the Atari for development purposes, you 
can  still  use  it  as  a database,  address book,  diary  -  in  fact 
*anything* that requires forward planning.

Thought!  is  so  flexible  and  diverse  it can  even  be  used  as  a 
replacement Desktop!

Thought! is compatible with all Atari 68K computers having a minimum of 
1MB of memory. A hard disk is preferred, but not essential.

----------------- 
AFTERBURNER040 
----------------- 

The  fabulous  MC68040  Toolkit for the  Afterburner040  has  now  been 
upgraded  to v4.09.  This,  and many other interesting items about this 
exceptional accelerator,  can be downloaded directly from Doug Little's 
Website (see above).

----------------- 
APEX ALPHA 
----------------- 

Although  we decided at an early stage to adopt a modular approach  for 
the  design  of APEX Alpha,  this has far-reaching implications  -  not 
least  the  fact that future expandibility will simply be a  matter  of 
placing new modules into the correct folder.

Firstly;  peripheral support can be added as and when required. Support 
should include scanners, printers and pressure sensitive touch tablets.

Secondly; as new tools and features are developed they can be purchased 
separately  as  upgrade option packs.  These will most  likely  include 
'special effects' tools and filters.

Using modular integration will therefore allow APEX Alpha to be offered 
as  a  'base' model containing all the necessary tools  for  high-speed 
image  processing,  and  future  expandibility  is  then  assured  with 
peripheral and special effects.

----------------- 
APEX VIEWERS 
----------------- 

The  essential  APEX Viewers are currently being updated  to  be  fully 
compatible  with Videlity and Nemesis high-resolutions.  These will  be 
made available shortly.

----------------- 
AGATE 
----------------- 

AGATe  (Anonymous  GIF  Animation Tool) is a new  utility  we  stumbled 
across recently!

This  is  a great Public Domain tool for the Falcon,  that allows  Flic 
animations  (such  as  those from APEX Media) to  be  transformed  into 
Animated  GIF's  - making it ideal for the creation  of  animations  in 
Websites!  Background  transparency can be automatically detected   and 
oversize  Flics  can be cropped to remove  any  extraneous  background. 
Interlacing and  various other GIF options are also fully supported.

----------------- 
BSS DEBUG 
----------------- 

The  only  true  Falcon  debugger  has  now  been  upgraded  for   full 
compatibility with MagiC,  Afterburner040 and Videlity. Can now also be 
used as a direct replacement for MON. Many other improvements have also 
been made.

The  upgrade  price  is just #5.00 to also cover  postage  and  packing 
within  the  UK.  Please  add a further #5 for shipping to  the  EC  or 
overseas.

----------------- 
C-LAB MK.X CASES 
----------------- 

Titan Designs are now shipping the superbly engineered C-Lab MK.X cases 
complete  with a separate Atari keyboard at no extra cost (either  Mega 
ST or TT-style). Price is still #199.00, with a #15.00 carriage charge. 
The  fitting  service has also been revised to include the  full  audio 
line input attenuation. Please call for prices.

----------------- 
VIDELITY 
----------------- 

All  beta-test problems have now been resolved and Videlity is  in  the 
process of being shipped. Videlity now includes full compatibility with 
Screenblaster  1  &  2,  and BlowUp Hard 1 & 2 to provide  even  higher 
resolutions.

----------------- 
HARDWARE 
-----------------

- SCSI CD ROMS 

Titan  can  now  supply Toshiba 12-speed (!)  SCSI  CD-ROM's  for  only 
#199.00, or built into the superior Pearl Series case for an additional 
#50.00.

- SCSI HARD DRIVES 

We  have a limited number of Seagate 420MB hard disk drives  remaining. 
These  are  mounted  into a Pearl Series case,  and  include  a  50-way 
Centronics terminator - all for only #169!!!

The  Peral  Series cases are purpose built,  extremely  compact  units, 
which incorporate PSU, SCSI ID switch, 2 x 50-way Centronic sockets and 
a small, quiet (very quiet!) fan with removable dust filter.

For  ST  owners,  if  required,  we  can supply the Translator  for  an 
additional #59.95.

- MONITORS 

15"  and 17" monitors (ideal for use with Videlity!) are also  becoming 
cheaper.  A  base  15"  model now only costs #249.00 and  a  17"  model 
#449.00.  Various  other  makes  and models  are  available,  including 
Panasonic, Hitachi, CTX, etc.

- MODEMS 

33.6K  modems are now down to #119.95!  We also have some 28.8K  models 
which are reduced to #89.95, but these are on a first-come-first-served 
basis. Both models are fully BABT and CE approved.

- MEMORY 

Although RAM prices are starting to rise again,  we can still offer the 
Falcon 14MB memory upgrade at #129.95 for the time being.  If the price 
of  SIMMs  do rise significantly,  then we will have no option  but  to 
raise our prices.

----------------- 
SHOWTIME! 
----------------- 

At  the  Birmingham,  London  & Glasgow shows (26/27 April and  11  May 
respectively)  we  will have 14MB memory upgrades to sell and  will  be 
demonstrating APEX Alpha, APEX Audio, Nemesis, Videlity and the Gribnif 
range of software.

If  you  wish to purchase something specific from us during  the  show, 
please  inform  us  beforehand  to ensure that we  do  have  the  stock 
available.

- NEMESIS UPGRADING 

While  we are not able to perform Nemesis upgrades during the show,  we 
can take a limited number of Falcons back with us to be shipped  during 
the  following week.  Please note that we do require the machines to be 
pre-packed  in  a carton suitable for transit,  and cannot  accept  any 
responsibility for damage due to inadequate packaging.

-------------------- 
AN EYE TO THE FUTURE 
-------------------- 

Titan  and BSS are working on new software and hardware  projects  that 
will expand the Falcon towards becoming a high-performance  workstation 
-  we're  already  part of the way  there  with  Afterburner,  Expose', 
Nemesis, Videlity, APEX Alpha, etc., but there's still plenty left!

Although  we are not quite ready to release information on  our  future 
plans,  you  can  be assured that the intended products will  be  high-
performance, inexpensive and very desirable!
