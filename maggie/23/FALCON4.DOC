"I  have  a dream,  I have a  Falcon" as Martin Luther King might  have 
once said had circumstances and assassins bullets not conspired to  cut 
him short from saying anything much at all..

Yes, we're still here, defying gravity and the inanities of a so called 
'market  logic' that demands you get a PC,  and then throw it away  six 
months later to get another one..  Yes,  a fourth years worth of Falcon 
based activity has thundered by with the usual batch of mixed reviews..

Atari who??
Atari takeover by JTS, blah etc.. Who cares anymore..

'Format wiped..
The big story of last summer was also one of the least surprising as ST 
Format, visibly shrivelling and shedding pages as time wore on, finally 
closed  its  doors..  In  spite of the remaining  staffs'  attitude  of 
surprise,  we  suspect that the rug had been made ready for pulling out 
from  under them for some time by Future Publishing,  anxious to drop a 
declining  title and concentrate on some new ghastly hybrid title  like 
'Pentium Cross Stitch Format' or whatever..

Atari Computing in dull caption shocker..
However,  a replacement for the late and not very lamented 'Format came 
about remarkably quickly, and appeared in the short space of time after 
the closure..  Atari Computing is subscription only, it managed to more 
than break even with its initial subscription run,  and even features a 
regular  'Maggie' section which must mean that someone somewhere  likes 
us  a  lot..  At the time of writing,  at least this magazine is set to 
stick around for a long while..

Diskmags deceased..
Some very big names in the diskmag world also produced their last issue 
in 1996..  ST News closed down and their loss affected all parts of the 
Atari community, even if the 'ST' part had shrivelled to almost nothing 
by  the end..  The Diskbusters Mag folding was a very big loss for  the 
Falcon  scene,  as  they  were one of the very few big  Falcon  'scene' 
orientated mags with a decent custom shell to rival ours..  A very slow 
revival is taking place under the 'Fun ' banner as the mag struggles to 
reach 'Undead' status under Bonus, a former DBA co-collaborator..

Shows and things..
1996 did produce some very memorable shows,  the early part of the year 
gave us the very major overseas trip taking in the Symposium Convention 
in Hamburg.. An event that got miles of coverage in Maggie 20.. Also we 
had our debut as exhibitors at the Autumn Atari Shows back here in  the 
UK, which was interestingly different as well.. '97 will have more in a 
similar vein, even if some of the foreign visiting has had a damper put 
on it temporarily..

New machines..
C-Lab spent another quietish year selling the C-Lab Falcon, recasing it 
as the Mark X for music studios and the like..  Other Atari clones such 
as Medusa and Hades tended to look to the TT part of the Atari heritage 
over the last year.. However, as 1996 came to a close, new and exciting 
news of a Falcon based super clone trickled out,  and the Centek Phenix 
became the machine of choice for people lusting to upgrade and  smartly 
avoid the Intel route..  With the right approach by Centek, this should 
be the big Falcon story of 1997!

Serious stuff..
Still quite a lot of interest and new releases..  FloppyShop's Positive 
Image  picture processing package saw release last year..  Not strictly 
Falcon,  but  made  good  use  of  the  machine..  MagiC  got  to  work 
(unsteadily  sometimes) on the Falcon..  Titan hit us with new hardware 
in the form of the hefty 68040 Afterburner upgrade and (still  waiting) 
Nemesis board..  Things such as the new Apex series of packages such as 
Apex  Alpha  and Apex Audio are definitely a hot item of  interest  for 
this  year..  Titan also gave us the cheap and well designed 'Videlity' 
software screen expander as well..

There are now up to three proprietary 'Web browsers for the Atari, with 
CAB getting to version 1.5,  and shortly to be fully matured at version 
2.0  with full Frames support etc..  One tangible success to the online 
community  was  the rapid groundwork to get  Atari  Computing  magazine 
going.. Without it, etc, it may not have got off the ground..

An  awful  lot  of items in this category,  including  the  release  of 
Papyrus 4 are not Falcon specific stories..  Most of the new generation 
of   'serious'  software  is  intended  for  Atari  machines   of   all 
persuasions..  We note with interest that a higher end machine is often 
preferred, and that 'Higher end' for reviewing purposes usually means a 
Falcon!

Slightly less serious stuff..
Another  reasonable  year,  with  more  promised  or  anticipated  than 
delivered..  Many of the things expected to appear in 1996 were subject 
to the usual delays, and are only just now starting to appear..

Demos..
There  were several releases,  but nothing ground-breaking to  redefine 
the capabilites of the Falcon as there were in 1995..  Well,  maybe the 
Symposium  4ktros showed what was the ultimate there,  but 1996 can  be 
summed  up  as  a  year where everyone was  either  clearing  the  back 
catalogue and releasing rehashed effects,  or holding on to much better 
code..  Notable  non-appearers were Aggression with their 'Motion Blur' 
or 'Motion' demo which seems to have been plagued by bugs and  hardware 
failures.. We saw glimpses of the equally revolutionary Avena demo, but 
this is only now coming to a conclusion in 1997..

On  the good news front,  signs of life from a Polish scene not as  yet 
shopworn and cynical like the French and German scene seems to be,  and 
looking  to be quite prolific this year..  Also,  Senior Dads were back 
with a bang, or should that be a looped Abba sample?

A mini revival of the ST demo took place,  with great work by Cream and 
the  ever willing Polish Scene..  Even Tat got in there with the mother 
of  all  Maggie  ST intros!   More to come in 1997  for  that  unjustly 
neglected machine?

Music  went all jangly and soundchip on my Falcon with the  release  of 
two separate Commodore 64 SID chip music players for it..  At very long 
last,  one of my lifetime 'must have pieces of software' finally turned 
up!!

Games..
Still a fair bit going on here,,  but with even more still stuck in the 
pipeline  and  waiting for someone to come along and give  it  a  swift 
knock to get it all flowing out again..

All  of the various Doom clones described previously are still  yet  to 
emerge,  although 'Running' has got a firm release date for this Easter 
and  should hopefully be in here as a full review at last..  'Bad Mood' 
seems  to  have  stalled  awhile,  and other Doom  projects  are  still 
floating around uncertainly..  Another game first mentioned in 1996 was 
'Willy the Adventurer', which is now at a more advanced preview stage.. 
Reservoir  Gods continued to excell with Skyfall,  and now we await the 
slowly appearing Spyhunter game for this year..

The  Falcon  version of Obsession can be crossed off  everybodies  Xmas 
present  list,  but  we did get the freeware release of Moonspeeder  as 
'Moongames'..  An  awful lot is still waiting to happen in '97,  and we 
look forward to it all..

Winner  of the 'Where did he suddenly appear from?' Cup was Pieter  van 
der  Meer and his platform blaster 'Neurobotix'..  May we see more from 
this fellow in 1997!

Conclusion..
Owning  a  Falcon  is still a worthwhile business  as  this  last  year 
proved..  A  fair bit of grim news,  but quite a few pleasant surprises 
mixed  in there as well..  I sense that this forthcoming fifth year  of 
Falcon activity will prove to be a climax in a lot of areas,  with many 
of these long awaited games finally getting there for one thing..  Demo 
activity  should  be  of  a higher  quality  than  in  previous  years, 
repairing  the break in continuity that took place last year..  Serious 
software  vendors  still support us with new products  and  updates  of 
existing ones, and we have a new paper magazine in the UK that actually 
caters properly for the users as well..  During this year, alternatives 
such as the Centek clone should start to come onstream, which offers us 
sight  of  the next generation,  and will start to replace  the  Falcon 
proper from there..  My previous comments regarding the generally queer 
state of the PC market still stand, and apply even more so now..

Suck it and see!!
