                           ATARI NEWSROUND

                      WITH JOHN "RAVING" CRAVEN

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-


[ HERE WE ARE NOW, INTER-TAIN US! ]

Despite rumours to the countary, Inter are still alive and well on the
Falcon! They are currently working on  a  new demo. Most of the coding
has been done be by Lucky  Of  ST,  but  there will also be effects by
Questor  and  guest  appearances  from  Energizer  of  Lazer  and  The
Innovator of Absence. It is set  for  release at the Intercon party in
November.


[ QUAKE UP BOO! ]

Black Scorpion Software  have  converted  Quake  to  the  Falcon! They
managed to get hold of the entire source code and so the whole game is
now on our beloved machine. A member of the Maggie team was granted an
exclusive preview at the recent atari show.  As you would expect it is
very slow, but it was amazing to  see  it on the Falcon. At this point
at time we  are  unsure  whether  this  will  be  released  as Doug is
currently busy with the new version  of Apex Media (which incidentally
looks fantastic!)


[ HAVE YOU PLAYED NINTARI TODAY? ]

The Reservoir Gods  have  completed  the  first  ever Nintendo Gameboy
emulator for the  Falcon.  This  upgrades  the  Gameboy  to  12 colour
capability and adds DSP based tracker  music and stereo sound effects.
Mr. Pink tells Maggie: "It's  not  a  generic  emulator, games will be
released individually with trainer  modes,  sampled  sound effects and
specially composed music. It is,  however, tremendous fun!". The first
release is the Gameboy version of Bubble Bobble.


[ GIANT STEPS ]

Stax developments  (or  should  that  be  RDT)  have  finally released
Running. The shareware  version  features  one  playable  level and it
looks stunning. The  game  is  fast  and  playable  and  has some nice
samples and is  excellently  presented.  Once  you  have  explored the
massive demo level, please  consider  registering  as software of this
quality deserved to be supported.


[ SONO OR LITER ]

Avena's astounding Siliconvention  winner  "Sonolomineszenz"  is to be
upgraded and  enhanced.  Already  version  1.2  (Sono  Lite)  has been
released, this supercedes the  party  release  by fixing numerous bugs
the most obvious being the problems  with  the DSP tracker. If you are
still struggling along with  the  original  release,  get this upgrade
now!

There will also be a  totally  remixed  version with extra effects and
better design - as if it wasn't  good  enough already! Agent T and Tat
have their hands on the proverbial knobs.


[ NEW BEAT OFF THE BLOCKS ]

New Beat are progressing quickly  with  their  Rayman like "Willie The
Adventurer". A new demo  version  was  recently  released (see preview
article elsewhere) which features a complete playable level. According
to main coder, Daniel  Hedberg,  a  lot  more  enemy sprites have been
designed and painted. This looks sure to  be the best platform game on
the Falcon!


[ ST FORMAT-IC FOR THE PEOPLE ]

The Senior Dads have released a new  demo called "ST Floormat". As the
title suggests it is heavily based around Future Publishing's deceased
magazine, and as usual it  is  a  colostomy  bag  full of laughs. Full
review in the next issue.


[ DONKEY ISLAND OF HOPE AND GLORY ]

Liverpudlian wide boy, Ed Cleveland, has released a new preview of his
Adventure game "Donkey Island".  It  is  a  graphical adventure in the
style of the classic lucasfilm games,  but features many references to
the atari scene.  This  features  more  locations  and  more character
interaction. Some minor problems  with  Falcon compatibility have been
fixed - in fact it should even  run  fine on ST emulators on the nasty
PC. There has been a lot  of  commercial  interest  in the game but it
will probably be released shareware.


[ VAN DER MEER AND LOATHING IN OUTER SPACE ]

Neurobotix creator, Pieter Van Der Meer,  is  busy working on an Elite
style trading game for  the  Falcon.  Maggie  have  seen  a very early
preview and Pieter tells us that he  is  still getting to grips to the
complexities  of  designing  a  whole   universe.  God  probably  used
something slightly more suitable than Devpac  3 on the Falcon! We hope
Pieter can pull this project off  as  the  Falcon needs a game of this
type.


[ WE HAVE IGNISION ]

With faces a fresh as  Stephen  Twig's,  Polish new boys "Pandemonium"
have burst onto the Falcon  demo  scene.  Their debut release, "Ignis"
was shown at the Siliconvention  and  showed  a  lot of potential. The
presentation, graphics and music were especially good, it was only let
down by some slighty cliched effects. Here at Maggie we hope that they
ditch the sad Satanic sloganeering and try  to be a bit more original.
Otherwise, welcome to the scene and good luck with future productions!


[ MODS AND RUCKUS ]

Graphic artist Mod has split with  German  demo group TNB (The Naughty
Bytes) and joined TSCC. The split wasn't acrimonuous, Mod explained to
Maggie that he felt TSCC  had  more  ambition  and more potential than
TNB. We at Maggie believe that TSCC  could become the biggest and best
German demo group  as  their  productions  get  better  all  the time.

Ironically,  TNB  beat  TSCC  in   the  recent  Siliconvention  96ktro
competition!


[ SYNTHLY THE BEST ]

Avena have begun work on  a  Virtual  Synthesiser for the Falcon. This
will work like the MIDI modules  you  see  in studios such as the EMU-
Orbit and Roland JV-1080. It  will  contain  banks of samples that you
can  manipulate  and  add  various  effects  to  via  the  DSP.  Early
specifications are very sketchy and it  is currently not known whether
it will be able to patch into  Cubase  or whether you will have to run
your sequencer on a separate machine to the Module.


[ NEMSISTERS ARE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES ]

Quite a few people have had problems trying to fit the Nemesis upgrade
into their Falcons. We  recommend  that  you  should leave the fitting
service to Titan or TUS unless you REALLY know what you are doing!
The Nemesis seems  to  be  selling  well  and  members  of  the coding
community are getting them so  it  should  be well supported. Both CIH
and Mr. Pink both have boards  fitted.  Daniel of New Beat Development
has also bought a  board  and  is  promising  Nemesis enhancements for
Willie the Adventurer.

Mr Pink also pledged to put the  board  through its paces. "We will be
going  through  all  our  productions  and  ensuring  they  are  fully
compatible with the Nemesis. We will release patches where necessary.
Don't expect speed increases  with  our  games  as  they are synced to
certain VBL timings, so any extra  free  processor time won't be used!
God-Boy, however,  will  benefit  a  lot  from  Nemesis  and  we  will
certainly  take  Nemesis   owners   into   consideration  with  future
productions probably offering them enhancements. The Nemesis is a very
exciting release for Falcon owners"


[ NEW POWER-UP GENERATION ]

"Power-Up"  is  a  new  racing  game   for  the  ST  and  Falcon  from
Czechoslovakia. It features neat  graphics,  sampled sound effects and
lots of different courses to pit your wits against. It takes advantage
of extra harder such as the Blitter  on  the STE and Falcon. It should
be available commercially by the time you read this.


[ NAS HYSTERIA ]

The excitement is building in  anticipation  of the Nordic Atari Show,
the annual get  together  for  Scandanavian  Atari  enthusiasts. Those
participating should be all the  usual suspects: New Beat Development,
Impulse, Dead Hackers Society, Aggression. We are told that there will
be Falcon releases at this party!


[ THE PLACE TO BE OR NOT TO BE ]

"The Place To Be" party  goes  ahead  again  this summer in France. It
promises to be a  more  Atari  oriented  event with organisers Eagles,
Scarface and EKO involved. Lets hope it can relive the glory days when
it produced such demos as "Are You Experienced?".


[ GIGAFUN - DA MENTAL! ]

Another French party that  should  have  a  good  Atari showing is the
Gigafun. In the past this has been  patronised by the likes of Exa and
MJJ Productions. The emphasis of  this  party  is  on fun. It has been
likened to a gig. It is sure to be  a good 'un. So why not pop down to
their Gaf and 'af it large!


[ AMIGOING GOING GONE! ]

Tommy of Avena has sold his Amiga, and is now computer-less! He is now
spending his time  composing  tunes  on  his  Roland  MC-303  so it is
unlikely that we will hear  any  more  mods  from  him which is a real
shame.


[ ARE YOU BEING SERVED? ]

The Jaguar server is a piece  of  hardware  that allows you to link up
your Atari (ST or Falcon) to  a  Jaguar  console. You can then program
this 64-bit beast!  Already  there  are  some  20-30 people developing
stuff via this method and some games  and demos have been released. In
the next issue of Maggie we will  bring  you  a full report on the Jag
scene and interview with Roine Stoinberg.


[ NET DREAMS ]

The Reservoir Gods are stepping up  their internet presence. They have
a new site run by musician MSG. Here you can download virtually all RG
productions including new releases such as God-Boy.

http://www.bolton.acs.basil.ac.uk/~msg1css/masion.htm

There is  also  a  Reservoir  Gods  mailing  list  which  will contain
information and news about past  and  future productions and of course
Maggie. If you want to join, contact:

leon@powys.tec.org.uk


[ I AMBLERY THE RESURECTION ]

Polish ST crew Confusions come back  to  life with a Slideshow, called
"Amblery". The code has been finished  for  a  long time, but the main
graphics man Raster has just bought  an  STe  and he is working on new
pictures.


[ BEHIND THE MASKOTA ]

The influence of the omnipotent  Senior  Dads reaches Poland. Maskotka
of Confusions was so impressed with "Air  dirt" that he has decided to
code a demo in the same  vein  for  the  ST! We wonder what the Polish
equivalent of the Sex Pistols are!


[ DARK AND PONG ]

Remember Insomnia?

"Dreaming about making mad love  to  my  girl on the heath/tearing off
tights with my teeth"

No not the Rollo and Sister Bliss  effort, but the ST demo from Luzaks
team. Wach, the main coder  of  this  has  now turned his attention to
coding a new game for the STe.

Super Pong - it may sound like an old concept, but it has been brought
kicking and screaming into 1997. It  will  feature 80 colors on screen
in an overscan  resolution  320*274  resolution  with  50khz  of sound
quality !


[ A HUGE PULSATING GAME THAT RULES FROM THE CENTRE OF GERMANY ]

Markus Binder's latest game "Cosmic" is turning into a bit of an epic.
Featuring fully rendered true colour  graphics, this three dimensional
shoot-em-up is now over 22meg in  size!  Start saving up for those ZIP
drives.


[ BE QUICK OR BE DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY ]

Swedish jugglers "Dead Hackers Society" are  working on a new demo for
the Falcon. The Maggie team has  seen  previews of some of the effects
and  they  are  very  impressive,  certainly  surpassing  anything  in
"Demolition". We  hope  they  will  not  be  lazy  and  get  round  to
completing for NAS, but this is DHS we are talking about!


[ DADS ON ONE ]

STOP PRESS! The Senior  Dads  have  just  released  "The Techno Demo",
which is the octogenerians answer to  demos such as Grotesque! We have
seen a preview and it is another senior masterpiece!
