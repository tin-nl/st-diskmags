
                       A Night out with Oscar..

Picture the scene,  it is late March,  'twas the night before the Oscar 
awards  ceremony,  but  it is an Oscar Awards ceremony on  a  different 
planet,  in a galaxy far away,  a planet where the Hollywood movers and 
shakers  have  decided not to lie down in the face  of  those  annoying 
nomination  grabbing English art house period films,  or those impudent 
cult  Scottish long drawn out drug crazed agonies of the soul dramas..

The big studios have decided,  if they can't beat them,  then join them 
instead!!  Some of the following may well seem alarming to you,  but it 
could happen just like that!

'Go ahead and Revisit Brideshead now, punk!'  
Conveniently forgetting the fact that this is a television series, this 
tortured mixture of inter-war society and politics, Clint Eastwood, the 
inevitable  decline of the aristocracy amid a carefree whirl of  summer 
loving with two people both called Sebastian..

'Jane Austen's Die Hard'
A  comedy  of manners and carefully observed social mores  and  romance 
with the minor aristocracy of Regency England,  set on top of a burning 
tower  block  featured  Alan Rickman and his  dodgy  'Mittel  European' 
accent  firing high-velocity bullets at the party-goers as they  abseil 
from the helicopter..

'Easy Strider'
The  definitive  cult  sixties road movie teams up  with  'Chariots  of 
Fire',  the  story  of  two young Oxbridge chums who  run  through  the 
American Midwest into a series of ever more bizarre and drug influenced 
adventures culminating in them being shot by two rednecks driving  past 
in  a  pick-up  truck..  The  award  winning  soundtrack  has  Vangelis 
nervously wobbling through his particular interpretation of 'Born to be 
Wild!'

'The American Patient'
"So  it's  a nice story,  but we take the english guy out,  and put Tom 
Cruise,  playing  Errol Flynn in..  Then we move it from a Second World 
War  setting to a post-apocalyptic future..  Replace the love  interest 
with  an indestructible killer cyborg,  but to get the family audience, 
we  get  Jim Cary in a cameo role playing Beethoven,  the loveable  but 
clumsy 200 pound mutt!  There must be some way that we can use the cast 
of  'Police Academy' as well...  I'm telling you,  we've got a surefire 
mega-hit!!"

Beavis and Butthead in 'The Wrong Trousers!'
Wallace  and Gromit are left on the shelf,  as cartoon land's favourite 
anti-heroes  get to grips with their most challenging role yet  as  the 
eccentric inventor and his long-suffering dog..  Heheheh! Remember when 
we  were  the 'in thing' fartknocker!  Now no-one gives a  stuff  where 
we've got to, huhuhuhuhuh!

'Eddie Murphy and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein..'
The  extrovert but ultimately limited comedian brushes Kenneth  Branagh 
aside,  and  applies his wide range of words beginning with f***,  erm, 
acting  skills,  and  stupid  laugh to this faithful  adaption  of  the 
original novel..  At least, his sperm aren't on crutches!! ("It's alive 
man, f*ck, yo' kidding me! Nobody told me it was goin' to do that! F*ck 
this! I'm outta here!")

'Four Weddings and an Alien'
Hugh  Grant  excels  himself  in the role he  has  made  his  own,  the 
diffident   genteel  English  prat,   assiduously  dodging  the   alien 
facehuggers  that  are claiming his carefree batchelor friends  one  by 
one,  and  forcing them into English country churches to get  married.. 
This all changes however, when he meets the Alien Queen played by Andie 
Macdowell!

'O.J Simpson's Ghandi'
No, forget it! Leave it! Okay!! That is the worst one yet..

Emma Thompson playing Roseanne.. (Yes, it's telly again, but...)
But after due reflection, maybe this one!!

'The Unbearable Lightness of Being a Pet Detective'
One  of  the most pretentiously titled pieces of cinema  in  existence, 
gets the Jim Carey treatment to give it an overdue facelift and fill it 
with   the  family  audience  grabbbing  chuckles  that  were   missing 
previously.. Oh dear!

'Trainspotting Academy Five'
Yes,  it's the same old jokes,  and the same lame cast, but they get to 
experience  a seedy vomit covered drugs hell in the  bleakest  Scottish 
Council  estate that current special effects technology is capable  of, 
and  yes,  there is still the compulsory  Blue Oyster Club scene  which 
was  never that funny in the first one of the series,  and should  have 
been quietly dropped thereafter..

You can start having those nightmares now!
