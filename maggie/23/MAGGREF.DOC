

             THE GREAT GUIDE TO THE "MAGGIE" UNIVERSE ...

                       According to Felice

A

Atari Computing:-

A new paper magazine,  published by Mike Kerslake.   Many  people 
from  the business Atari scene (largely from the ashes  of  Atari 
World)  contributed  articles  for this new  mag.   Issue  1  was 
released  at  the  recent Goodmans Atari Shows  in  1996,  and  a 
reprint  of this was also done due to the fact that the mag  sold 
out completely at the shows !!   The Maggie Team have also got in 
the  act  here,  with  several articles from  back  issues  being 
printed, along with back articles from AtariPhile diskmagazine.

Atari Net Locator:-

Started  by  Maggie contributor,  Jonathan Nott,  ANL (as  it  is 
called) is probably the best Atari index site in the UK.   Coming 
with  news,  views and links updated every month,  the  ANL  site 
recently  was awarded the accolade of 'Cool Site Of The  Day'  by 
one of the major Internet search engines.  Check it out today !!

AtariPhile diskmag:-

This  relatively new diskmag came to life sometime  around  March 
1996, shortly after the closure of Atari World.  Under the Falcon 
FacTT  File,  they  were  getting some  very  good  HTML  reviews 
submitted by names like Frank Charlton, who worked on ST Format.
AtariPhile  came  by as a result of Colin,  Kev and  Roger  Derry 
accepting  these  articles,  and Issue 1 proved to be  a  runaway 
success.   At the time of writing,  they are now on Issue 3, with 
Issue 4 to be released sometime before Christmas.

Atari Shows:-

Atari  shows that have been held in England since 1993 have  been 
much better than those held previously - and this was once  again 
the  case  for the recent shows held at  Birmingham  and  London, 
organised  by Goodmans PDL.   Hopefully some more shows  will  be 
following very soon.

Atari Workshop:-

One  of two trading names used by System Solutions,  largely  (we 
think) for the Atari repairs,  research and development division.  
Headed  by the boss,  Karl Brandt,  some excellent  hardware  and 
software packages have made it out over the years from here.   As 
the signs look, they will be around for a long time yet.

Atari World:-

This publication,  published by Compo UK (headed by Neal O'nions) 
and edited by Andrew Wright,  was from the ashes of another great 
magazine  called  ST  Review.   This  mag was  sold  by  its  own 
publishers  to  Future  Publishing,   publishers  of  ST  Format.  
However, this state of affairs was not to everyone's satisfaction 
and  AW started up as a result of this.   Unfortunately  however, 
Compo went bust in February of 1996, leaving a gaping hole in the 
Atari marketplace,  which has now,  happily been filled with  the 
release of Atari Computing.

B

BBS (42BBS):-

BBS's,  commonly called Bulletin Boards, are inhabited by a small 
group  of people from different parts of the  country.   You  can 
usually  find  support regarding Maggie from 42BBS,  as  that  is 
where  Felice tends usually to log on to.   We're also  sometimes 
seen  on  Ad-Lib,  run  by Frank  Charlton,  even  rarer  we  are 
sometimes on the IRC.

Beardsworth, Kev:-

Kev Beardsworth, along with Colin Fisher-McAllum, was responsible 
for the first stages of the Falcon FacTT File and is now co-Sysop 
of 42BBS,  as well as contributing articles for AtariPhile.   Kev 
got  the  award  at the recent London  Atari  show  organised  by 
Goodman  PDL for being the 'Seb Coe' lookalike  !!   He  recently 
suffered  some bad luck when his car was broken  into,  hopefully 
this  is  all sorted out now.   Kev was also poached as  a  staff 
writer for Atari World magazine,  this only lasted a week or  two 
before  the  mag went bust,  which was a real  shame.   He's  now 
working as a mechanic.

Brandt, Karl:-

As MD of System Solutions,  Karl Brandt has been involved in  the 
Atari scene right from the beginning.  German-born, Karl saw that 
there were a lot of seriously good Atari products being  released 
in Germany without being seen here in the UK, so System Solutions 
was  set  up,  with the Atari domain being known  as  the  'Atari 
Workshop'.   They  have gone from strength to strength in  recent 
years.   Karl  and the guys who work under him are very  friendly 
and  helpful - and are always pleased to see us when we  stop  by 
their  stand  at  shows !!   In the near  future,  we  should  be 
involved  with  production  of the  'Ultimate  Diskmagazine  CD', 
containing the complete back issues of Maggie,  ST News and other 
diskmags to date.

C

Canada:-

One  of  the  biggest  countries in the  world  that  is  rapidly 
becoming  home  to many former coders and other people  from  the 
Atari  scene.   Already,  Stefan  Posthuma and  Gard  Abrahamsen, 
together with some other ex-Atari dudes have made it over  there.
In September of 1997,  Felice will be making his way over  there, 
as  he's been told by the Canadian immigration office in  England 
that  his application has been successful.   Toronto seems to  be 
the  place where the work is,  hopefully Richard Karsmakers  will 
join the others soon as well.

Charlton, Frank:-

Frank  Charlton has been known to us for a few years now  as  the 
freelance Reviews Editor on ST Format, where he was employed from 
1992  until  the magazine's closure  recently.   He  was  largely 
responsible  for  giving  Maggie 18 a good  review  in  the  mag, 
something  which had not happened for a long while.   Frank  also 
used  to run the support line for Demon.   He's now  expected  to 
join the team at Atari Computing magazine in a little while.

Chubby :-

A  little character made up from ASCII-art,  copyright  (?)  Mike 
Noyce.   He had a little article all to himself in a recent issue 
of ST News.

Cleveland, Ed:-

Ed  Cleveland joined Maggie as a contributor shortly after  Chris 
Holland received an unexpected letter from him,  one of the first 
feedback letters we have had from people in the UK !! Since then, 
Ed  has written a few articles for us,  most of which  have  been 
included in past issues of Maggie.  Ed visited Chris recently and 
brought a very interesting CD with him called Speccy  Sensations, 
that we enjoyed very much.

Crash Test Dummies:-

This band, originating from Montreal in Canada, first came to the 
knowledge  of Felice when he bought their first album during  his 
first trip to Canada back in the summer of 1992.   In 1994, their 
second album was released world-wide and very nearly got to No  1 
in the UK,  only to be held off by some crap  techno-band.   This 
was despite the fact that the album was 'album of the year' !!
Late 1996 sees the release of their third album,  which sounds as 
though it is a hit everywhere apart from in the UK,  where  there 
has been a total lack of advertising or promotion for it.  Really 
odd, if you ask us !!

D

Davies, Kev "Taff" :-

Like  Mike Noyce,  Kev Davies is a Maggie contributor.   He  also 
wrote numerous articles for ST News on occasions and joined us to 
Symposium 96 along with Mike.   Kev was also fortunate enough  to 
share a house with Mike during their recent courses at  Sheffield 
Uni.   Kev has finished his course now and the last we heard  was 
that he was unemployed ATM, hopefully he'll find something soon.
He's  also looking at upgrading his Falcon on a DIY  basis  after 
seeing  similar setups at Symposium 96,  so maybe he'll  come  up 
with  something  that  will rival  hardware  imported  by  System 
Solutions, eh ??

DBA diskmag:-

Until  very  recently,  DBA Diskmag was produced  and  edited  by 
Slimer (Sietse Postma) and other people from the Dutch scene, who 
made us very welcome at Symposium 96.   An alternative diskmag to 
Maggie but part of the Magnetic Interludes 'Big Three',  DBA  did 
have some nice articles in all issues that were produced.  Sadly, 
it looks as though this good diskmag has come to the end.

Dead Hackers Society:-

Responsible  for  one  of  the  winning  Falcon  demos  of   '95, 
Demolition,  the  Dead Hackers Society certainly arrived  with  a 
bang - and look sure not to go out with a whimper,  not just  yet 
anyway.  If you're reading this and have not yet seen their demo, 
why  don't  you place an order for it with one of  the  Atari  PD 
libraries ??

Delta Force:-

Delta Force were, up until late 1993, a coding crew largely based 
in  Germany.   They  were responsible for  producing  the  rather 
swanky  shell  for  the ST versions of  Maggie,  that  were  only 
updated very recently by Steve Tattersall  (Tat).   Unfortunately 
however,  they were also responsible for issue 10 of Maggie, yes, 
THAT issue, which had all of the er ... adult related writings in 
it.  Since then, we have avoided this occurrence happening again.

Dempsey, Kev:-

Largely  responsible for the front-end artwork in each  issue  of 
Maggie, Kev has also been known to submit the odd article or two.  
One of his most funniest pieces of artwork to date was the famous 
'ST  Floormat'  related cover on Issue 16 of Maggie.   Kev  is  a 
member of the Reservoir Gods, using the handle of SH3.

Disney World:-

The  place  that Felice finally visited after how many  years  of 
waiting.   A  very enjoyable 2 weeks was spent here visiting  the 
various  parks  and seeing most of the shows  on  offer  ...  the 
experience  here  was very legendary indeed,  and may  have  been 
repeated by Kev Dempsey.   For the full report,  read the article 
in Maggie 18.

Dream A Little Dream

One  of Felice's most favourite movies,  starring  his  favourite 
actress, Meredith Salenger and one of his favourite young actors, 
Corey Feldman, this movie, released in 1989 in the US and 1990 in 
the UK,  soon became a hit to Felice.  It was reviewed in full in 
a previous issue of Maggie.   If anyone reading this hasn't  seen 
it yet, do yourself a favour and hire it - you won't regret it !!

E

Edge Magazine:-

This magazine,  produced by Future Publishing, is probably one of 
the  worst mags ever to arrive in the UK  market.   Every  single 
issue is full of stories with the basis of 'we know what is  good 
and bad in games software'.   However,  every issue also contains 
details of the latest machines available over in Japan,  which is 
not  much  good  as it normally takes a few  years  before  these 
machines  become available in the UK.   A parody of this mag  was 
written for DBA Diskmag, called THE EGG - that is just how bad it 
is.  We wonder just how long this has got to go ....

Encill, David:-

The  main  point of contact and manager of  Titan  Designs,  Dave 
Encill  tends  to  be the one to speak  to  at  Atari  shows.   A 
friendly guy who has a deep interest in all things Atari,  and is 
a regular reader of Maggie, Dave gets the slightly dubious honour 
of  being able to grab videopics of various Atari dudes at  shows 
before  the Expose digitiser was released !!   He also  sends  us 
some  very  nice emails about Titan's forthcoming  products  from 
time to time, hopefully this will continue !!

F

Felice:-

This  tends  to  be the name that Richard Spowart  tends  to  use 
to sign-off articles for Maggie.   Quite where the name came from 
is  probably a mystery to most,  but that is now to  be  revealed 
here.   The  name actually comes from the character  that  Joanna 
Pacula  played in her most successful movie to date,  called  The 
Kiss.   Felice has been a little quiet of late regarding  writing 
articles since his well-received one about his trip to Florida in 
June  1995.   Hopefully he'll be going to the US again in  a  few 
months or so.

Fisher-McAllum, Colin:-

One of the founding members of the Falcon FacTT File,  Colin  has 
gone  on  to even bigger and better things,  not  forgetting  the 
legendary File, of course.  Being the Sysop of 42BBS, the BBS for 
the  Falcon scene is a tough job at times due to Colin's  health.
Despite  the fact that he is one of the unfortunate sufferers  of 
multiple sclerosis (MS),  he has such a good character and is  so 
friendly  and helpful that you wouldn't think he does have a  bad 
day !!   Even though this poor guy is in a wheelchair due to  the 
MS,  nobody in the Atari scene sees him at all as being  disabled 
or  looking sorry for himself.   Colin is one of the most  valued 
members of the Atari scene.  In recent months, he started editing 
the  FacTT File's new diskmagazine,  AtariPhile,  which is  going 
from strength to strength in the Atari scene.   Many people  have 
contributed articles to AtariPhile,  yes, including Felice of the 
Maggie Team alongside others.  Col is also a member of the Wessex 
Atari  Group (WAG),  indeed,  at the time of writing this  he  is 
supposed to be leading the comms demonstration at the forthcoming
meeting !!  Col was also interviewed in issue 19 of Maggie.

Flintham, Nick:-

Only  finally  becoming  known to us at the  recent  Atari  shows 
organised by Goodmans PDL,  Nick has often been the first to  say 
hello  on  those rare occasions when Felice has logged  onto  the 
IRC.   He  was also responsible for being one of the few who  did 
not go into the sauna at Helsinki,  Finland, that occurred during 
the  visit  by himself and Neil Jones-Rodway  to  the  Aggression 
party. (WHAT HE GOT TO DO WITH MAGGIE? - ED)

Froggies Over The Fence:-

One  of  the last major megademos on the  ST,  Froggies  is  best 
remembered  for its rather excellent 'Star Trek' style  routines.  
Since  this demo was released,  ST productions of new demos  have 
come to a virtual stop.

Future Publishing:-

Launching with a classic magazine called 'ACE:  Advanced Computer 
Entertainment'  back  in 1987,  Future went on  to  produce  many 
magazines that were sold in newsagents throughout England.   They 
were also responsible for ST Format,  which absorbed ST Review in 
December 1994.   Unfortunately,  Future's magazines in general do 
tend  to have a lot of excessive wibbling in them,  none more  so 
than in Edge and a couple of their Internet mags that are  around 
at  the  moment.   The last thing we did in fact hear  were  that 
sales  of  computer  magazines  in newsagents  were  down  by  60 
percent,  it is probably not surprising.  In 1992, Frank Charlton 
joined  the  team  behind ST Format,  and managed to  make  it  a 
worthwhile magazine.   Towards the end, however, the mag became a 
shadow of its former self, and finally croaked in July, 1996.

G

Gardner, Si:-

A  guy who first introduced himself to us at our first  visit  to 
the  WAG meeting back in July,  1996.   He's very  interested  in 
demos and is hoping to come to the next party,  either  Symposium 
'97 or Fried Bits 4,  depending on what gets organised and who is 
going  down.   Si works for a soft-drinks manufacturing  company, 
yet he still manages to be late for work even though the entrance 
is right opposite where he lives !! :-)

Good, Chris:-

One of the first members of the Falcon FacTT File,  run by  Colin 
Fisher-McAllum,  Kev Beardsworth and Roger Derry,  Chris has gone 
on  from those humble beginnings to writing for  Atari  Computing 
magazine.   At the Atari shows organised by Mike  Goodman,  Chris 
designed and put together a 'Virtual Web' project on his  Falcon.  
This  was on display at the shows for visitors to use and  proved 
to be very successful at the Atari User Groups stand there.  Even 
though Chris is rumoured to possess a slightly 'dodgy' look about 
him,  he  is  a good character and well worth  having  on  board.  
Chris is also the master of the Web pages on behalf of the Wessex 
Atari  Group  (WAG)  that he is a member  of,  along  with  Colin 
Fisher-McAllum  and  Si Gardner,  and indeed some of  the  Maggie 
Team!!

Goodman, Mike (Goodmans PD):-

We  didn't  have  too  many  dealings  with  Mike  Goodman  until 
recently,  when  he organised the Atari Shows in September  1996.  
When an initial enquiry was made about having a free stand by the 
Maggie Team,  Mike turned out to be able to accommodate us, which 
was real nice of him.  Goodmans are now one of our distributors.

Goring, Roy:-

Along with Chris Good and Mick Lock,  Roy is one of the  founding 
members of the Wessex Atari Group (WAG) meetings.  He's only come 
to  our knowledge quite recently since the WAG  meetings  started 
up,  but is one of the friendliest Atarians on the scene.  At the 
recent  Atari shows organised by Mike Goodman,  he helped on  the 
free  stand  that  was given to the  Association  of  Atari  User 
Groups.

H

Holland, Chris (CiH):-

Editor  of  Maggie  from  Issue  11  onwards,   but  was  also  a 
contributor  from  Issue 2 as well,  when Maggie  was  edited  by 
Michael  Schuessler.   After the infamous Issue 10 was  released, 
following  a visit from Michael with the very useful Delta  Force 
source code, editorship was transferred to Chris.

Hollis, Dave:-

The  editor of the relatively new arrival in the  diskmag  world, 
known as ST+,  Dave had previously been involved with the Panther 
Owners  Group  until  this had ran  its  course.   ST+  has  been 
amazingly  successful over the last year or so,  gaining  readers 
from  across the globe,  due to it being available  from  various 
sites on the Internet.

I

Inner Circle:-

One  of the many demo crews that existed on the  ST,  giving  the 
world such demos as the 'Decade Demo', amongst others.

J

Jochen Hippel:-

One of the legendary music composers on the ST, however little is 
heard from him these days.

Journey Of Natty Gann:-

The  first  major movie from Disney to  star  Felice's  favourite 
actress,  Meredith Salenger.   It tells of Natty's story to  find 
her  father  after he left the area to look for  work.   A  truly 
enthralling film, with a sequel expected any day now.

K

Karsmakers, Richard:-

Up until very recently Rich Karsmakers was known for his diskmag, 
ST  News,  which  finally closed after ten  years  of  existence.  
Based in Utrecht near Amsterdam,  Rich wrote articles for  Maggie 
and  DBA  Diskmag,  most  of these appeared in issue  12  of  DBA 
Diskmag.  Since then he has finished his four-year English course 
at  college  and has gone on to do a  one-year  teaching  course.  
Rich  is very much into the heavy metal side of music and  tended 
to show this in all issues of ST News.   We had and still do have 
a lot of contact with Rich from time to time.

Kiss, The:-

One of the most successful, stylish horror movies to be released, 
The  Kiss  got a mixed set of reviews  at  first.   Starring  two 
relatively   unknown  actresses,   Joanna  Pacula  and   Meredith 
Salenger,  this movie was the one that catapulted both  actresses 
into stardom for a long time.   The movie has a superb storyline, 
with  some nice special effects devised by the Chris Walas  Group 
(responsible  for the effects in 'The Fly') and was  directed  by 
the director of Robin Hood, Pen Densham.  Over the last few years 
it achieved 'cult' status in the US, with a directors cut version 
of  the movie released,  which was longer than the  original  but 
still just as good.

L

Lazer:-

Largely  responsible  for the fabulous 'Lost Blubb' demo  on  the 
Falcon (which was,  incidentally,  the winner of the Fried Bits 3 
competition), Lazer have been known for other good demos as well.
Headed largely by Energizer (Harald), the group produced 'Warum',
'Autowaschen Verboten' and some other small demos,  including  an 
intro  for the 96K competition at Symposium '96.   Not  much  has 
been  heard  of  them  in  recent  months,  hopefully  we'll  see 
something of them again soon.

Lock, Mick:-

Mick  Lock  became  known to us when we  started  to  attend  the 
meetings of the Wessex Atari Group.   He recently bought a Falcon 
from Ofir Gal,  and had a few tales to tell regarding setting  it 
up !!   As WAGmaster,  Mick tends to lead the club meetings  with 
various announcements,  before the general talking starts.  He is 
a regular user of 42BBS, run by Colin Fisher-McAllum.

Lost Boys, The (TLB):-

A  classic  demo-coding crew who made their name on the  ST  with 
such  classic  demos as 'MindBomb' and 'Life's  A  Bitch'.   With 
members  like Michael Schuessler and Tim & Dave  Moss,  TLB  were 
well-known in the demo scene.   Nothing much has been heard  from 
any  of  the  former  TLB crew for some  years  now,  but  it  is 
understood that some former members are now working in the US.

Little, Doug:-

Partly responsible for the Doom clone on the Falcon known as  Bad 
Mood,  Doug,  as  part of Black Scorpion Developments (a wing  of 
Titan  Designs) the guys are busy with Apex Alpha and other  good 
products.  Doug will be best remembered for his desperate looking 
around  the  Maggie Team stand at the recent Atari Shows  to  see 
just  where the elusive Commodore 64 was hidden ...  only  to  be 
told  that it was actually coming from CIH's Falcon.   After  the 
London  show ended,  Doug turned up complete with hard  disk  and 
grabbed a lot of new stuff from us.

M

Maggie:-

The diskzine that you're reading now,  under the capable hands of 
the Maggie Team.  We've been around for 22 issues now at the time 
of writing, and still going strong!!  Over the last five years or 
so,  Maggie started off with a chequered history, but since issue 
11 has grown to be one of the best respected Atari  diskmagazines 
on the market today.  Issue 18 marked our rebirth in the business 
marketplace  however  with an outstanding review in  Atari  World 
magazine,  whilst issue 20 was one of the first PD products to be 
reviewed in Atari Computing magazine, produced by Mike Kerslake.

Maggie Team:-

The  Maggie  Team  are basically those  individuals  involved  in 
submitting  articles to Maggie on a regular  basis.   Such  names 
include Richard Spowart,  commonly known as Felice in the  Maggie 
Team  together  with  names  like  Mike  Noyce,  Kev  Davies,  Ed 
Cleveland,  not forgetting the Ed,  Chris Holland or CiH as he is 
known  usually.   Another  contributor called  Gus  Spank  writes 
regularly for us, but can you work out just who he is ? :-)
Richard  Karsmakers  also  contributes articles to  Maggie  on  a 
similar basis (at least he will be now that ST News has closed)!!


N

Nott, Jonathan:-

We first really met Jon at the famous Maggie Party in August '95.  
It  was discovered then that he had a craving for Jammie  Dodgers 
that can multiply,  due to Chris Holland going down with the very 
same  thing  until they were  finished,  however.   Jon  used  to 
produce a diskmag called Skynet Times,  whilst now he is involved 
with  a self-designed project on the World Wide Web called  Atari 
Net  Locator (ANL).   ANL recently got an award from an  Internet 
magazine in the US for being one of the most comprehensive  sites 
on the 'Net,  which was certainly good news.   Jon is also a user 
of 42BBS and manages the ANL and 42_MART areas.

Noyce, Mike:-

A  contributor to both ST News and Maggie,  Mike Noyce got a  bit 
more well-known throughout the Atari scene after his visit to the 
successful  Maggie Party in August of 1995.   He was  responsible 
for  a  series of articles about a  guy  called  Chubby.  Despite 
having the build of a rugby player, Mike is certainly without the 
attitude  of one !!  He does enjoy the odd  pint  or two.  He 
also joined us for the famous Maggie Team/Reservoir Gods trip  to
Hamburg,  Germany for the Symposium 96 party  at  Easter 1996.


O

Oxygene:-

One of the members of the famous Lost Boys crew on the ST.   Also 
the name of a demo group,  that produced a demo containing a good 
sample from Genesis' album 'We Can't Dance'.

P

Pacula, Joanna:-

An  actress who originally comes from Poland,  Joanna Pacula  was 
first  seen  in  the movie based on the book  by  Richard  Rashke 
called  'Escape From Sobibor'.   The movie told of how more  than 
six hundred Jews successfully escaped from the Nazis in World War 
2 on October 14, 1943.  Since then, she has been in a fair amount 
of movies, and has been one of Felice's favourite actresses.

Perry, Rob:-

One  of the dudes from System Solutions.   Hopefully sometime  in 
the  near future we could be seeing the 'Ultimate Diskmag CD'  as 
one of his projects for the new year (1997).  Rob was known as DK 
of  the Dentrassi a few years ago,  and was also responsible  for 
releasing the now-famous 'Cuddly Demos' on the ST.

Q

Quebec:-

A city in Canada,  where the famous 'World of Demos' tv programme 
was made. Probably.


R

Reservoir Gods :-

A Falcon coding crew that has produced some spectacular games and
utilities over the last few years or so.   Run by Leon  O'Reilly, 
and  featuring other members such as Kev Davies, Kev  Dempsey 
and Tash plus others, they are responsible for GodPaint and great 
games like Double Bobble 2000 and Tautology II.   Their new game, 
Skyfall,  is  nearly due at the time of writing.   They are  also 
behind  the new Falcon shell that was first unveiled from  Maggie 
18, at the now famous Maggie Party.

Ripley (Tash):-

One of the few females to be involved in the Atari scene,  Ripley 
is the main graphics artist for the Reservoir Gods.  She drew all 
of the characters and sprites for all of their recent top  games, 
and has also participated in design work.   Tash certainly  seems 
to  have  a  natural talent  for  graphics,  hopefully  when  she 
finishes  her  education in a few years she  may  find  something 
where she can use these talents to the full.

Rodway-Jones, Neil (Arnel):-

Neil was unknown to us until he suddenly turned up to join us  at 
Victoria  Station  to go to Hamburg for Symposium  '96.   He  was 
probably the unluckiest guy on the journey;  the well  documented 
fright that the drunk knifeman gave us in the American restaurant 
at the Hamburg Hauptbahnhof was largely directed at him.  Happily 
though no harm was done,  he was just a bit shaken up.   Neil was 
responsible  for  one  of the funniest articles  in  issue  1  of 
AtariPhile about his trip at New Year '96 to the Aggression party 
at Helsinki, Finland as well.

Rutt, Graeme:-

The  main  man  behind customer support  from  System  Solutions.  
Graeme  tends  to  write the manuals that  come  with  their  new 
products.   He,  like the others in the company, works under Karl 
Brandt, and is a fairly regular reader of Maggie.

S

Salenger, Meredith:-

An  American actress whose performance and general beauty in  her 
movies attracted Felice to her, so much so that he was one of the 
first people to produce a page on the World Wide Web dedicated to 
her.   After  her  performance in such movies as Dream  A  Little 
Dream and The Kiss, Meredith dropped out of the movie scene for a 
while,  but  has now more than made up for the lean  years,  with 
performances in Legacy of Sin alongside the guy who used to  play 
'Doogie Howser M.D', Neil Patrick Harris.

Schuessler, Michael:-

Editor of Maggie since the very first issue,  Michael was also  a 
member  of the 'Lost Boys',  under the pseudonym of "Sammy  Joe".  
As  well as editing Maggie until issue ten,  Michael worked  with 
The Lost Boys on their fantastic classic ST demos, which included 
Mindbomb, Life's A Bitch and Ooh Crikey, Wot A Scorcher !!

ST Format:-

Produced  by Future Publishing,  ST Format lasted for just  under 
eight  years in total,  containing articles largely  written  in-
house.   However,  over  time,  the magazine did get  worse,  one 
specific  time being just a year or so ago when they wrote  in  a 
review of System Solutions product called the Desktopper that  it 
was  capable  of bringing down aeroplanes.   At the time  it  was 
written  it  was  intended to be taken  as  a  joke,  but  System 
Solutions did not see the funny side,  with Karl Brandt writing a 
very stiff letter to them that appeared in a future  issue.   The 
mag  also  suffered  from middling to  poor  editors,  which  was 
thankfully  sorted out when Nick Peers took the  helm,  with  the 
expert  help  of Frank Charlton and  Andy  Curtis.   Towards  the 
beginning of last year or so, the page count suddenly dropped and 
the magazine folded in July, 1996.

Steve Tattersall (Tat of Avena)

Tat,  as he like to be known,  was a member of Digital Chaos, one 
of  the  many Falcon coding crews.   We got to know him  when  he 
arrived for the Maggie Party,  since then he has been involved in 
some  great products.   Recently,  he was working on a new  demo, 
whilst he is also responsible for updating the Delta Force  shell 
for  the ST versions of Maggie.   He accompanied us to  Symposium 
'96 at Hamburg,  Germany,  where we met most of the other  coding 
crews.

ST News:-

One of the greatest diskmagazines in the Atari scene which  sadly 
closed recently,  for good,  after ten years.   Edited by Richard 
Karsmakers,  with contributions from such diverse people as  Mike 
Noyce,  Kev Davies,  Stefan Posthuma and many many more,  ST News 
was,  until recently,  THE diskmag for the Atari scene.  Articles 
were  usually very good but sometimes a little short  on  content 
and  number.   Still,  a lot of articles were very big  and  well 
worth reading, which more than makes up for actual number in each 
issue.   In  actual  fact,  some of the articles you now  see  in 
Maggie were inspired by those in ST News !!

Symposium 96:-

Quite  definitely the event of 1996 as far as the Maggie Team  in 
general are concerned.   This was our first coding party  abroad, 
attended  by just under a thousand other scene  people.   We,  of 
course,  joined  the Atari section that was occupied by  DBA  and 
Lazer,  along with many other groups like Arto and  Sentry.   Two 
long coach journeys with no sleep at all was a bit of a pain, but 
at  least  the way back home was punctuated with a  meeting  with 
Richard Karsmakers, even if it was at 6.30 am in the morning !!
The biggest realtime article ever seen in an issue of Maggie  was 
also written here, albeit on pen and paper.

System Solutions:-

One  of  the best Atari dealers in the UK,  with  the  honour  of 
having the most expensive stand at the recent Atari shows.   They 
seem  to  be one of the few barometers left for the  UK  business 
Atari scene .... put it this way, if they go bust, who knows what 
will happen ??   Happily though,  they do seem to be making their 
money at the Atari scene with the shows and through mail order.
Karl Brandt is the MD of Sys Sols, together with other names like 
Graeme  Rutt and Rob Perry,  were also the driving  force  behind 
Atari  Computing  magazine.   They preferred  magazines  like  ST 
Review  and the sadly deceased Atari World to  publications  like 
Future's ST Format, due to the articles and content.  The company 
are also firm readers of Maggie as well !!


T

Titan Designs:-

Titan Designs,  hailing from Birmingham,  is the software company 
that  brought Apex Media to an unsuspecting Atari  scene.   Black 
Scorpion  have been in charge of writing most of their  products, 
under the firm hands of Doug Little.   David Encill is the front-
line man, and is usually the one at the front of the stand at all 
Atari  shows  they've  attended.   Titan have  always  been  very 
supportive  of  Maggie,  regularly sending us press  releases  by 
email.  They are also very keen readers of Maggie, with copies of 
most  recent  issues  being sent to them as  and  when  they  are 
released.

U

Universal Military Simulator:-

An ancient Rainbird game which gave us lots of ancient battles in 
3-D  gridded  contour  format.  Most memorable for a  famous  but 
previously unreported battle between two user defined sides.  The 
primitive,  but numerous Wibble People of Patagonia, and the more 
heavily armed and technologically advanced Gitface Nation.  After 
many hours of ploughing through complex combat algorythms, the ST 
declared a no score draw due to rain, and a pitch invasion by Hun 
Tribesmen.

V

Vic Wright:-

A chap behind the late and suddenly closing ST Handbook. This was 
an A5 magazine which we encountered during the Summer 1994  Atari 
Show  in  London.  Vic ran into financial trouble,  shame really, 
especially for Vic.  

W

W****r:-

An  unprintable  term  used  to  describe  some  people  who,  at 
Symposium '96,  decided to help themselves to our food.   If  you 
take  off the 'er' and add 'um' instead you'll come up  with  the 
name of the place that we noticed on our coach ride to Germany.

Wessex Atari Group (W.A.G) Club Meetings:-

Held  once  every  six  weeks  or  so  at  the  Fire  Station  in 
Whitchurch,  Hampshire,  these  regular  meetings are  now  being 
attended by both Chris Holland and Richard Spowart.   Many  other 
people who also,  incidentally,  feature in this  guide,  attend, 
this includes Colin Fisher-McAllum and Chris Good.

X

Xylophone:-

Quite a few of these versatile instruments are probably found  in 
Canada.  As Felice is going there later this year, let's hope so, 
eh!

Y

Yahoo:-

The name of a common Internet search engine on the PC.  A totally 
non-relevant  entry,  but the same goes for a lot of the rest  of 
this as well.


Z

Zzzzzzz:-

Something  that we could have done with on the trip to  Symposium 
96, but had to do without in the end !!  Still, at least Leon got 
some ... never mind about Tat !!
