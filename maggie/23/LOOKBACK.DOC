
Hi  there Chris,  and congratulations on another good issue!  Thanks  in 
particular for the 'Antiques Roadshow' piece in Maggie #22.  It  brought 
back a few memories that I thought had been over-written, so I dived for 
my  discbox  and dug out a couple of articles on the  same  theme.  They 
originally  appeared in STEN #15,  in November '93,  but  they're  still 
relevant,  and they catch some of the excitement of the 8-bit scene that 
we seem to have lost in these high-tech days.  Ladies and gentlemen,  it 
gives me great pleasure to introduce....

It was 1985,  and you couldn't turn on the TV or open a magazine without 
being told that computers were about to change your life.  Every  parent 
had  to  buy  one,  or  see their children left  behind  in  a  changing  
workplace. Every householder needed one to drive the automated home that  
was  just around the corner.  And everyone else needed one just to  keep  
abreast of this revolutionary new technology.  Well, that's what we were 
told, and that's what we believed.

It was the first time that anyone other than the dedicated hobbyist,  or  
obsessed  technician,  could have a computer at home,  and I wanted  one 
with  a vengeance!  I didn't really know what I wanted it for.  I had  a 
vague   idea I could automate my wargames with it,  but the real  reason 
for  buying  one was to join in the fun.  The only problem  was  that  I 
didn't  have any  money...  I was working for a jobbing printer  at  the 
time and my wages just about kept my head above the water. But desperate 
times  breed  desperate measures,  and there was nothing for it  but  to 
work harder and  eat less.  

A secondhand machine was the obvious choice,  but even with new   models 
appearing  every six months,  and prices falling at the same  rate,  the 
demand  was so high that they held their price well - it was a  seller's  
market and everyone knew it.  Even the high street stores couldn't carry  
enough stock to satisfy the demand.  Spectrums walked out of the door as  
soon  as they arrived,  and the 30% failure rate returned them  just  as  
fast. I bought 'Personal Computer News (PCN) every Thursday to check out 
the  classifieds,  and when I finally had 130 saved,  I knew the  great 
moment had come.  A BBC 'B' or one of the 'plug-in-and-go' Amstrads  was 
beyond  my  means,  but  I could just about stretch to  a  Sinclair  48K  
Spectrum.  I  didn't  know  it then,  but my life was  about  to  change  
dramatically...

I  was  single and obsessive,  and my life revolved around wargaming, 
getting  drunk and taking too many drugs.  (But nt necessarily  in  that 
order.) But Thorvald,  the  Swiss god of programming,  was there to save 
me.  I  entered  the Midnight  Programming phase of my  life  and  never 
really came back.

The fact that most users also programmed their machines is probably  the  
biggest  difference  between then and now.  I can't think  of  a  single  
machine  that  didn't have some form of BASIC built into  it.  This  was 
available from the  moment you turned your machine on,  and this,  along 
with the fact that you  needed to know a few commands to use  it,  meant 
that a good 50% of users  were also keen programmers. If you could break 
into  a  commercial programme,  you could examine the code and add  your 
own   features  to it.  This was all part of  the  excitement.  I  wrote  
databases from scratch,  added extra options to a modem  programme,  and  
got my own disc drive utility up and running.  

Let's  have a look now at the magazine that fueled the  fun.  A   sample 
copy  of  PCN  for  the week ending January 5th 1985  had  52  pages  of  
listings for a wide range of machines.  There were also news pages  with 
the  latest from  the home and business worlds,  adverts,  software  and 
hardware  reviews,  Ken  Garroch's  problem  pages  and  Mike  Gerrard's  
Adventure tips. And all this for 40p a week - eat your  heart out Format 
Publications!

This  issue contained listings for a disc manager for the Commodore  64;  
machine code sound for the Memotech MTX; a game for the BBC 'B'; machine  
code protection routines for the Spectrum;  a drawing programme for  the  
Amstrad CPC 464; and the last instalment of a game listing for the Atari  
400.  'Mini  Office'  for the BBC was reviewed,  along with  the  Penman 
colour  plotter. There was an overview of the Spectrum,  detailing  its 
hardware,   software  and peripherals;  and two pages of  games  reviews 
that  treated  them   seriously,  instead  of  an  excuse  for  juvenile 
silliness.  And don't forget that this was back in the days of literacy, 
when there was more text than pictures on a magazine page...  

But the best part was always the adverts.  Silica Shop were selling  the  
recently released Atari 800 XL for 129,  with the 1040 Program Recorder  
for an extra 34.  If you were rich,  there was also the 1050 127K 5.25" 
disc drive for 199.  This was the  machine that I should have bought. I 
wouldn't  have  met  as  many  interesting people  as  I  did  with  the 
Spectrum,  but I would have had the  following at my fingertips:  64K of 
RAM,  24K  of ROM (with Atari BASIC  built in),  256  colours  available 
simultaneously on screen (16 intensities  of 16 colours),  4 independent 
sound synthesisers, a proper keyboard  (rather than the Spectrum's 'dead 
flesh' rubber keypad),  a cartridge  port, and 11 graphics modes with up 
to 24 lines of 40 columns or 320 x  192 resolution. The only problem was 
that the user base was tiny, and the only software for it was imported 
from the States at a premium price.  It was cheap,  but it wasn't a poor 
man's computer.

The other options were the BBC 'B' at around 300, the Acorn Electron at  
199,  the  MSX  machines  with price tags ranging  from  199  to  300  
(remember  how the MSX'ers used to get really worked up when  you  asked 
them how  many machines had been sold in Britain?),  the Commodore  C16, 
the Apple  ][e,  the Oric (enough said),  the Enterprise (sixteen months 
to be born,  six months to die),  the 48K Spectrum at 199, the Sinclair 
QL,  the  Amstrad  C464 (348 with a colour screen,  239 with  a  green 
screen),  the Sharp MZ-700 series,  and so many other machines that I've 
forgotten.

Back to the adverts again.  Our programmes were stored on cassette  tape  
and  took  forever to load.  I probably spent more  time  adjusting  the  
record/playback  head  on my machine than actually using  the  Spectrum!  
Disc drives were rare and expensive beasts that used 5.25" floppies with  
a storage capacity of a couple of hundred K.  For Spectrum owners  there  
was  always  the Sinclair Microdrive,  a fast tape  recorder  that  used  
matchbook-sized   cassettes  with  a  very  narrow   tape.   They   were 
innovative  but,  like most Sinclair  products,  reliability  was  *not* 
their middle name...  Disc drives were  beginning to appear in the  home 
market,  but with a price tag of 200+ and  with limited  capacity.  The 
lucky few who could afford a hard drive were looking at 999 + VAT for a 
10 Megabyte Winchester.

Ten  5.25"  discs (in the obligatory plastic box) would  have  cost  you 
19.95  for single-sided ones and 21.85 for double-sided.  Anyone  with 
the  new  3.5" drive would expect to pay 4.00 per  disc,  although  the 
prices were  beginning to fall as the market expanded.

But the best part of any computer magazine was the small ads.  The sheer  
range  of programmes that were sold direct was  astounding.  How  about,  
"Lifeboat.  A menu-driven database of lifeboat stations and their boats.  
Selection  by  station,   county,  boat  type,  or  boat  details.  Also  
simulation  of  service  call out.  All  royalties  to  the  RNLI.  BBC,  
Electron,  tape 4.00, disc 6.00"? Or, "Prove to your friends that your  
computer  is  really useful.  Plan their garden with our  data  bank  on  
plants. Send 9.95 for databank on Sinclair QL microdrive cartridge."  

Everyone was falling over themselves to supply the programmes that would  
make the machines useful. Most of the smaller programmes advertised then  
would now be issued as PD or low-cost Shareware, but they were the first 
of their types and helped to fuel the excitement.

Times and expectations change,  but there's always something  lost.  I'm  
writing  this  piece on a 4 Meg STE,  with a 180 Mb hard  drive  and  an 
Deskjet - a set-up that would have been impossible then,  or,  if it had 
existed,  unaffordable),  but there's something missing....  Where's the 
enthusiasm   gone  to?  Back then,  we  were  programming,  pushing  the 
machines to their  limits,  but above all,  *doing*. These days, we just 
consume.

As  we  all  know,  computer  technology moves  quickly  and  most  IBM-
compatible  PC's  now  have 386 or 486 CPU's and  several  megabytes  of 
memory.  The   Pentium  (586)  is on the horizon  and  motherboards  are 
evolving with the  Local Bus beginning to establish itself. New software 
applications   require  greater speed,  more memory and more  hard  disk 
space.

Anyone  who glances at the magazine shelves of John Menzies cannot  fail 
to   notice the large numbers of computer magazines.  Just a  few  years 
ago,  you'd have been lucky to find more than one or two such magazines. 
Let's   have  a brief look over our shoulder...  How else will  we  know 
where we're  coming from?

I have beside me two magazines,  December 1981's Personal Computer World  
and January 1982's Practical Computing.  The former proclaims itself  as  
BRITAIN'S LARGEST SELLING MICRO MAGAZINE.  The term Personal Computer or  
PC hadn't really been coined then;  we were more likely to talk about  a  
Microcomputer or Micro.

IBM  had yet to dip its corporate toes into the 'micro' market  and  was  
still  preoccupied with mainframes.  Lasky's had on offer the  Apple  II 
with   48K  memory and black and white modulator for  776.25  including 
VAT. For  another 431.25 you could get a floppy disk drive.

Lasky's also had the Sharp MZ-80K with 48K memory plus a built in screen  
AND cassette deck for file storage. The whole thing only cost 399. This  
machine had rather an odd keyboard with calculator-style keys.

If this was too expensive you could have gone for the Acorn Atom with 8K  
ROM and 2K RAM for only 149 plus VAT. Also popular was the TRS 80. A 40  
track  floppy disk drive could be added for only 420,  giving  you  the  
(then) vast storage capacity of 184 Kbytes.

Clive Sinclair had made his mark and the ZX80 had been superceded by the  
ZX81.  For  17.50  you  could double the memory size to  2K  simply  by  
swapping a chip.

Business  users  who needed more power could buy  the  Superbrain  micro  
computer  for 1875 plus VAT.  Included in the price was 64K RAM  and  a 
320K  floppy disk drive. Hard disk drives were available from 3500 plus 
VAT.   For  this you got an 8 inch Winchester Micropolis with  7  Mbytes 
capacity.

The cover story in this edition was AUNTIE'S MICRO: THE FULL STORY which  
covered  the imminent release of the BBC Micro.  This was  probably  the  
first  home  computer  with colour graphics,  sound  and  a  good  BASIC 
language  built in. Many of these are still in use today.

The trouble with all these systems was the lack of any  standards.  Some  
had Z80 processors,  some had the 6502. CP/M (Control Process / Monitor)  
was  the  nearest thing to a standard operating system and  it  wouldn't 
work  with the 6502.
