            Some little demos and intros that came our way

In among all the whopper sized mega demos and largeish intros,  quite a 
bit of littler stuff also emerged..  Here is the best of it..  We start 
with  a determined assault on the sort of territory usually covered  by 
the Senior Dads..


 F6 - By Cream.. (Falcon, might run on ST?)

Now you will have probably read our Sonolumineszenz demo review by now, 
and  will have deduced from that review,  that Sono' (to keep it short, 
and  easy  for  us!) is one of the most significant demos  ever  to  be 
produced  on  the  Falcon..  Well,  whilst Cream were watching Tat  put 
together  his masterpiece,  they decided to 'honour' his efforts with a 
GFA basic coded version of his demo..  With severe limitations on time, 
and  I believe we are talking about the sort of small amounts  of  time 
that DBA used to use to produce their masterpieces, quite a bit has had 
to be compromised from the state of the art design and coding of  Tat's 
original..  There  is  not a lot of Agent T's graphical  excellence  in 
there either, but that is down to the fact that he coded this thing!

In a wobbly near-mono vector line sort of way,  there is just enough to 
recognise the main elements of the proper demo it is 'honouring'..  The 
soundchip  version  of Tommys awesome music composed by  Tao  is  quite 
faithful to the original Amiga tracker tune as well..

Trivia item 1.  Apparently if this demo is run under NVDI or some other 
software accelerator, it is over in, like no time at all!

Trivia item 2.  It was shown at the fake demo competition at the Sili', 
before  the real thing was shown in the main demo competition..  Only a 
few  people  who were in on the making of the demo got the  joke  as  a 
result..

Rating  -  Needs to be seen in conjunction with 'Sono,  the  demo  that 
inspired it..


 Bugblatterbeast 4k Intro - By TSCC.. (ST and Falcon)

Bugblatterbeast deservedly won the 4k intro category with a stonking 3D 
bumpmapped TSCC logo on screen,  in 4k, on an ST! Yes, even my very old 
STFM.. It never stops, so it makes quite a nice screen saver as well..

It runs faster with a Nemesis fitted Falcon as well..

That's all we really need to say..

Rating - 94% - Bluddy good!


 T'tensuppenzauber 4k Intro - By TNB.. (Falcon)

(I'm not sure what the second character in the name is supposed to be?)

This  missed first place in the intro competition but managed  to  take 
second  with a 3-D Wolfenstein maze,  in 4K..  The limitation on progam 
size didn't allow this to run to textures, but we get some nice shading 
on the maze instead, and there is the bonus of a fiery sky that appears 
towards the end of this little demo..

Very nice!

Rating - 90% - Recommended..


 30 I Cube 4k intro - By Dynacore.. (Falcon)

30 I Cube crept into third place at the Siliconvention 4k  competition, 
and whilst it is good,  not quite up there with the other two 4k intros 
we've  looked  at  so far..  This can be best described as  a  sort  of 
dancing  plasma  fractal type screen,  with two spinning  fractal  type 
objects merging and then pulling apart again, in some eternal ballet of 
the screen.. (Yes, CiH, you've got the flowery metaphors out tonight!)

Another one that runs forever so another good screensaver here,  if not 
quite as good as the TSCC Bumpmap screen we reviewed earlier..

Rating - 80% - Yes, I'd make time for this one as well..


 Escape Music Compilation - Escape.. (Falcon, STe version promised)

This was an early effort for 1997, from the group who gave us 'Sili Con 
Carne' (see main demo reviews)..  To put it simply, it is a fancy music 
compilation  menu,  in  the  manner  of the  famous  Independent  Music 
compil  series..  A  nice  menu with lots of floaty  plasma  bits,  and 
several reasonable if not outstanding tunes..

Rating - 76% - Reasonable music collection..


 Apollo 1.3 - Unknown, we suspect a French coder.. (Falcon)

Apollo 1.3 is not so much a demo in the classic sense of something that 
runs  a set programme of effects,  but is more of a  3D world  concept, 
and indeed may be a preview of a game engine?

It  is  a textured and depth-cued lunar landscape,  over which you  fly 
your imaginary space ship with a Jaguar joypad..  bank, tilt, and crash 
into the looming mountains.  bouncing off crazily to fly in the reverse 
of  the direction you were going..  The most similar thing we have seen 
is  the little 'Mars DSP' screen,  a version of which turned up in  the 
EKO 'R U Xperienced' demo, green hills and all..

It  benefits  from having a Nemesis fitted as well..  So did the  'Mars 
DSP' demo..

Rating - 90% - Could be an awesome game, if it ever gets that far..


 ST Floormat Demo - Senior Dads.. (ST and Falcon)

And  finally,  you can't keep the Senior Dads down for long (nor  would 
you care to try!) The ST Floormat demo is their 'tribute' to the  sadly 
deceased ST Format magazine,  a publication famed for being informative 
and  'On topic',  especially with legendary editors Paula Richards  and 
Trenton Webb at the helm..  Anyway, this demo was allegedly inspired by 
an  article  produced during the tenure of Trenton Webb,  titled  "Demo 
Coders. are they crap or wot?" The Dads decided to draw upon their deep 
and  intimate  knowledge of coding,  as given to them by the ST  Format 
coding gurus, and this demo is the end result..

Well,  not quite the end,  as they held onto it for quite some time, to 
make  sure that STF was really dead,  before they could risk  releasing 
it,  and  avoiding packs of litigation crazed zombie lawers making  low 
moaning noises and gently tap-tapping on the windows of the Senior Dads 
World GHQ..

As  we said earlier,  all their coding knowledge,  given to them by the 
wise  wordsmiths  of STF is shown in here..  The stunning rasters,  the 
ultra-smooth  top border scroll,  and even ST Format's patented top and 
bottom  border  removal  technique,  which involves nothing  more  than 
switching the monitor from 50 to 60 hertz! Now why didn't Tex, Level 16 
and  company,  think  of that!?  Oh yes,  the soundchip music takes you 
right back to those classic days as well.. 

If you can avoid a migraine, the scrolltext is well worth a look too..

Rating - 95% - Well, what are you waiting for!!

 CiH.. May '97
