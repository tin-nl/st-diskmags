                              Bill Bryson

                       (Bookworm strikes again!)


I've  always  been a sucker for a well-written travel  book,  and  they 
don't often come better than this one.. 

Take one bearded American,  who is a long time resident in the UK,  get 
him to return to the states,  but before he does so,  get him to have a 
last  tour  of  the British Isles,  writing from the  viewpoint  of  an 
interested outsider,  but one who has had long experience of what he is 
seeing, and you get this book..

It  starts with an interesting episode,  the authors first hours in the 
UK, a freezing cold night in Dover spent over twenty years ago, and the 
scarcely  warmer  welcome  at a typical boarding house  of  the  period 
seemingly run along the lines of one of the more oppressive prisoner of 
war  camps..  Concluding  that  he was doomed to remain  friendless  in 
Dover,  he  had  not  been back there since,  but started again  as  if 
entering from Calais.. 

His  tour  takes  in much of the country,  with some  well  constructed  
observations  made  along  the  way..  As  well  as  the  normal  place 
descriptions  and narrow scrapes associated with these,  we also get  a 
fascinating  insight  into  what  it was like  to  work  at  the  Times 
newspaper  during the early days of the Wapping dispute..  An early job 
at a mental institution where the inmates were just left to get on with 
it,  and an all too true description of how confusing Milton Keynes can 
be to an unaware traveller who does not know the place already.. We can 
really relate to that one! 

This is not a summary of what is in here,  there is far too much in the 
book  to  do  that..  'Notes  from  a Small  Island'  is  an  extremely 
informative and densely packed book,  with the writer anxious to get as 
much in as possible, as it is his last chance to travel on this scale..

Quite a lot of observation tends to be of the architectural merits,  or 
otherwise of a lot of places,  and there is a not so hidden message for 
conservation  of  the countryside,  which seems to be in the  hands  of 
people  who  say 'what hedgerows?' Even much  criticised  organisations 
such as the former British Rail are assessed as doing remarkably  well, 
and  now even able to offer edible food,  which is a giant leap forward 
in anyone's book!

Bill  Bryson is a gentler and more reflective character than the  other 
American  travel  writer  whose  very  footsteps  we  worship  in  (P.J 
O'Rourke), his views of Britain are generally complimentary, picking up 
on many good points that most British people don't realise are  there.. 
Not afraid to criticise,  but it is gentle and good natured and lacking 
bile..  This  is  a writer deeply in love with his subject matter,  but 
able to remain clear-headed at the same time..

With  Bill Bryson,  you don't get the distracting and cheapening  jibes 
aimed  at Americian political figures that tends to mar P.J  O'Rourke's 
work  slightly..  The travel writing part is on a par with that  living 
god,  but  Bill  Bryson admirably avoids being too clever for  his  own 
sake, and the book is a lot better for it..

Strangely enough,  in a comparison between these two writers, you never 
see  P.J O'Rourke raised to a display of direct anger,  or at least  he 
doesn't  choose to tell us about it,  but there was a memorable episode 
in this book set in a McDonalds restaurant in Edinburgh which goes like 
this..

                         --------------------
In the end,  Fractious and impatient,  I went into a crowded McDonalds, 
waited  a  century  in  a long ragged line,  which made  me  even  more 
fractious and impatient, and finally ordered a cup of coffee and an Egg 
McMuffin.

"Do  you want an apple turnover with that?" asked the spotty young  man 
who served me.

"I'm sorry" I said, "Do I appear to be brain-damaged?"

"Pardon?"

"Correct me if I'm wrong,  but I didn't ask for an apple turnover,  did 
I?"

"Uh... no."

"So  do I look as if I have some mental condition that would render  me 
unable to request an apple turnover if I wanted one?"

"No, it's just that we're told to ask everyone like."

"What, you think everyone in Edinburgh is brain-damaged?"

"We're just told to ask everyone like."

"Well,  I  don't want an apple turnover,  which is why I didn't ask for 
one. Is there anything else you'd like to know if I don't want?"

"We're just told to ask everyone."

"Do you remember what I do want?"

He  looked in confusion at his till,  "Uh,an Egg McMuffin and a cup  of 
coffee."

"Do you think I might have it this morning or shall we talk some more?"

"Oh, uh, all right, I'll just get it."

"Thank you."

                           (End of book bit)
                         --------------------

I somehow don't think the conversation would flow that way if it was  a 
bunch  of  Afghan or Hizbollah guerrillas he was talking  to!  However, 
keep that one by if anyone ever tries to sell you something 'extra' and 
unwanted with your main meal, new suit, or whatever..

Conclusion  - If you are into this style of writing,  and tire of  what 
Maggie  has to offer,  the damn peculiar Symposium trip in issue 20 and 
all, then you can do no worse than to pick up a copy of this fine book.
