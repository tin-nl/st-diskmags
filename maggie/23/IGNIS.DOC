                                IGNIS
                                      
                         Intro for Falcon 030

                  (Is this a bit elaborate or wot??)

Pandemonium  came  as  the second wave of the Polish  invasion  of  the 
Siliconvention, and their own rather unique if overstated 'design' demo 
in the form of Ignis..

Ignis  seems  to  be a rather self-conscious attempt to have  a  go  at 
Spirits  for their technically amazing,  but rather sullen 4ktro  which 
crashed onto the large monitor screen at the '96 Symposium, celebrating 
the  death  and  resurrection of Christ and the barbecueing  of  a  few 
people  who  didn't generally fit in..  As such,  both Pandemonium  and 
Spirits can be said to have tried a bit too hard with their  respective 
subject matters..

The demo starts with some looming booming music that is supposed to put 
you  in  a God or devil fearing frame of mind,  and some  fancy  fonted 
high-res  text sets the screen,  culminating in a burning pentacle logo 
sort of picture.. The title picture is a suitably beastly subject, seen 
previously in a CD-ROM compilation, but used to good effect in here.. A 
magnifying/refracting bubble runs over the picture for a short time..

A  prime  example  of the Ignis 'design' is next,  with  a  commonplace 
series of gouraud shaded 3-D polygons.. Boring enough, you might think, 
but  livened up considerably with a 'picture frame' of  satanic  intent 
and skulls and crosses..

It  is  clear that Pandemonium have had access to the  source  code  of 
another  famous  demo,  as some very familiar fiery greets  are  next.. 
These  are  overfamiliar to me,  as I have had to endure  the  constant 
playing  of a certain two year old demo of constant INTERest to  Felice 
at  the  various Atari Shows we've attended..  Which should give you  a 
heck  of  a  big clue about which demo I'm talking  about!!  Okay,  the 
greets change in time to the music, so a gain there I suppose..

This  'borrowing' seems to carry on into the next effect as well,  as a 
fiery vector pentangle spins around the screen,  framed by two upturned 
crucifixes,  before  moving  onto  more conventional vector  cubes  and 
strange lumpy polygons.. Spooky, huh?

The  final effect starts with a revisit to the large and  magnificently 
drawn picture by a.n.other,  this time,  shaded out in greyscales,  and 
then a transparent 3-D cube appears,  all done out in a smooth green,or 
was that purple?  No that was the next object that came along, I think? 

And then,  'THE END', and you are left without a return to the friendly 
blue tones of the desktop, to contemplate the infinite blackness of the 
soul... Until you press reset at least..

TECH VIEW by Tat:  Oh dear, I hate demos like this. Sorry, but I can't
stand the design.  The code is reasonably nice  but nothing new.  Best 
effect:  the fire vector things.  I'm also extremely suspicious of the
text file for this demo...  I  suspect Pandemonium  are reasonably new
to the  Falcon,  and could well  knock out something  pretty good,  so 
better luck next time guys

Ratings..

Graphics:-  77%  -  A  fair amount of material in  there,  most  of  it 
original..

Sonix:- 82% - Pretty good music perfectly in tune with the mood of this 
demo..

Gee-Whiz:- 60% - Something old, something else old, something borrowed, 
something blue,  er, no, green.. Sorry, but recycled effects just don't 
cut  it  anymore,  only got a 60% mark in this category because it  was 
well put together..

Overall:- 70% - Against the best the rest had to offer, this demo seems 
to be lagging behind somewhat, although it was not badly put together..

And another thing, they could be getting a bad reaction for some of the 
contents of the textfile that came with the demo!
