When we first saw Willie  around  a  year  ago  we  were all very impressed. It
seemed like the Falcon was to get its very own Rayman style platform game. But,
almost inevitably, things went very  quiet  and  many  started to doubt whether
Willie would ever appear.

But as I  well  know,  game  development  is  a  slow  and  meticulous process.
Thankfully Willie is very much alive and well  and New Beat have released a new
preview version.

This preview begins with a  hi-res  full  greyscaled portrait of Willie. Colour
then gushes into him and some credit  text  flies up onto the screen. Bashing a
key taking prompts a control request graphic  to  scroll up the screen. Once we
have made our selection of Jaguar Joypad or Keyboard the game begins.

The first version of Willie showcased Thomas Bergstorm's excellent graphics and
featured some  silky  smooth  hardware  scrolling.  The  sprite  was  amusingly
animated and the sound was  good.  The  whole  game  was  steaming  along at 50
frames per second.

Ah, we though, but they only have the main sprite on screen (admittedly made of
several  smaller  sprites).  When  all  the   baddies  and  other  sprites  are
implemented there is bound to be slow down!

How wrong we were!

Willie now features legions of  exceptionally  well  drawn and animated baddies
and still runs at a sparkling 50 frames per second. Result!

Lets take time to savour the superb background graphics. New Beat are using 256
colour mode, but everything still resonates with colour. There is a very neat 3
layer parallax scroll with 2  planes  used  for  these background graphics. The
scrolling is as smooth as Baby Spice's bottom.

The new enemy characters that have  appeared  in  this version are great. There
are some small colonial  chaps,  the  archetypal  British  hunter complete with
safari kit and droopy white  moustache.  These  duck  under  your fire and then
grumble at you. "Such impertinence!" they seem to say.

Also featured is a clumsy goofy teethed enemy. When attacked he turns round and
chases after Willie then  attempts  to  throw  a  punch.  If  finally killed he
stumbles over, eyes bulging, and dies. Very comical.

There are also falling coconuts to avoid as well as some nasty glinting spikes.

The game doesn't just look nice, it is very well designed too. The level starts
off in a quite  straightforward  manner  introducing  you  to  the technique of
climbing, jumping, attacking and avoiding coconuts. As you get higher up in the
jungle the  enemies  are  more  widespread  and  the  coconuts  more prevalent.
Completing this level is rather tricky.

I must admit that I did swear at this game a lot as I was killed numerous times
just before reaching the exit. But the  good  sign is that I immediately loaded
up again to try and reach the goal.  It definitely possesses that "one more go"
property - it's already very addictive.

A word about the sound - it is crystal clear and the tune is well suited to the
level. There are some also  nice  samples  which punctuate the game, especially
Willie clicking his fingers.

New Beat must have a real sense of humour  as the game is full of comic touches
which can't fail to bring a smile  to  the  face of the player. The sprites are
all excellently animated and  have  their  own individual characteristics, they
don't just moronically walk left to right like baddies in most games.

New Beat have a real winner on their  hands here, a definite candidate for best
Falcon platform game. I think it  has  the  potential to be better than Rayman.
Let's hope that the final version has  lots  of  levels on it, because when you
get hold of it you're not going to want to stop playing it!
