                                 Imagine
 

A  look at the crash of Imagine Software as seen through the eyes of  a 
film crew.

Depending on when you read this article,  you may be about to see, have 
seen  or  maybe  missed,  a fascinating programme  on  BBC2  television 
(December 13th [1984] at 8.00pm) in the Commercial Breaks series  about 
Imagine  Software  Limited.  The Liverpool software giant  crashed  out 
during the summer after a life of a little over 18 months, during which 
time  it produced more hype than any other software house  before.  The 
company  appeared to bask in self-created publicity,  much of which was 
very  clever,  and  so it seems appropriate that its death should  also 
have been as well recorded for posterity by the media it sought for its 
promotion,  as had its successes in life. As things turned out, the BBC 
film  crew got a rather different story to the one they had  conceived, 
but  much of the material shot for Commercial Breaks cannot  appear  in 
the  finished  programme,  because  it falls outside the scope  of  the 
series format.

Roger  Kean spoke to BBC director Paul Andersen as he was busy  putting 
the finishing touches to the programme.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                             GIVE US A BREAK

Early  in the new year of 1984 BBC Television director  Paul  Andersen, 
who  among other things was about to direct some of the programmes  for 
the Commercial Breaks series, witnessed the enthusiasm surrounding some 
of  the new generation of computer games that were beginning to  appear 
in  the shops,  and appreciated that the emerging software houses  were 
pioneering  a new market.  Commercial Breaks is a series which  broadly 
examines  the struggles of individuals and companies who are trying  to 
'break'  a  new  product into the market place.  To  Andersen  the  new 
computer  game  software  'moguls' seemed like a  good  subject  for  a 
programme  and he began researching,  looking for a suitable company to 
feature.

An  obvious  place to look was in computer magazines,  and  it  rapidly 
became  apparent  that Imagine was a strong contender  because  of  the 
spate of clever advertising that was then appearing which was  designed 
for  Imagine by Stephen Blower of Studio Sting,  an offshoot company of 
Imagine,  coupled  with the fact that Andersen,  like so many people in 
Britain,  was  reading  the  national press publicity  about  Imagine's 
teenage  programmer Eugene Evans,  who was said to be earning 35,000  a 
year and could afford a fabulously expensive car when he was still  too 
young  to  be able to drive it.  There was obviously a story  here  for 
Commercial Breaks.

The  next step was to approach Imagine and ask the owners whether  they 
would mind being featured. So Andersen travelled to Liverpool and spoke 
to  the young bosses of the new company,  Mark Butler and David Lawson. 
Lawson  had  written Arcadia,  Imagine's biggest hit at the  time,  and 
Butler  had  sold  it  into shops starved  of  software  over  the  '82 
Christmas.  At  first  they  seemed  a  bit  reluctant,  and  Imagine's 
Operations Manager,  Bruce Everiss,  explained that there were too many 
things  under wraps to allow in the prying eyes of television.  On  the 
other  hand the publicity-eager Everiss must have been able to see  the 
promotional  capital  that could be made out of having BBC  TV  hanging 
around for some weeks making a film about them. Dave Lawson saw another 
angle  altogether,  and to appreciate this it's worth remembering  what 
put Liverpool on the map in the early sixties.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                           BIRTH OF AN INDUSTRY

The Beatles transformed British (and then world) pop music in the early 
sixties,  and  created a modern myth about Liverpool,  their home city. 
Over  the  years  Liverpool  has  come to  see  itself  as  a  possibly 
undernourished and underprivileged city,  but one bursting at the seams 
with  imagination and guts.  With the eighties something similar to the 
Beatles  seemed to be happening,  only in computer software this  time, 
and  Dave  Lawson must have seen Imagine as being at its  very  centre. 
Stephen Blower says that, 'Lawson had some greater vision of what could 
be  produced in software than anyone else I've ever met.' At  the  time 
when Paul Andersen approached them,  Imagine was working on the concept 
of  the  megagames,  having  exhausted the possibilities  of  the  home 
computer's  limited  memory.  Lawson,  who was largely responsible  for 
overseeing their development,  saw that the BBC would be able to record 
for  posterity  the  concept,  development  and creative  effort  of  a 
dedicated  team  in bringing these new super games out.  In a way,  the 
Imagine team, and especially the men who ran the company, would be seen 
to  be  ushering in a new Beatles era,  but in software rather than  in 
music. 

For the TV director the megagames also offered an essential lynchpin on 
which  to  hang  his programme.  It all seemed ideal and,  at the  time 
neither party knew how dramatically different things would turn out.

When  the  BBC  film crew went in to start shooting  material  for  the 
programme  they realised that Imagine made good visual material;  huge, 
luxurious offices, acres of carpet, computer terminals by the ton load, 
lots  of young programmers,  secretaries in abundance,  young 'gophers' 
acting as runners for the management and a company garage packed with a 
fleet of Ferrari Boxers,  BMWs for the lesser executives and the famous 
Mark Butler custom hand-built Harris motorbike. At the time Imagine was 
employing  103 members of staff.  Andersen had a funny feeling that  it 
all looked too good to be true - and it was.

He noted that beneath the energy and bustle there were inconsistencies. 
Principal of these was an apparent split in the senior management which 
meant  factions  were working against each other.  But the first  noted 
discrepancy in the outward bravado was that Eugene Evans had  obviously 
never received anything like the 35,000 a year quoted in the PR  story. 
But  what seemed more surprising to Andersen,  was that Evans had never 
really  written  any programs either - certainly nothing  that  Imagine 
cared   to  publish.   This  might  not  have  surprised  some  of  his 
contemporary  Liverpudlian  programmers  who  were  working  for  other 
software houses, however, who knew much better.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            THE GROWING SPLIT

Eugene Evans,  like Mark Butler, had worked at Microdigital, one of the 
first  ever  British  computer stores,  situated  in  Liverpool.  Bruce 
Everiss was also associated with Microdigital,  and so were many of the 
programmers  who  were  later to become the bedrock  of  the  Liverpool 
software  business.  They  all knew each other pretty well.  It was the 
sort of in-bred atmosphere which leads to personality clashes, and soon 
enough the BBC team began to see evidence of them.

The  disparity  between  the  publicity hype  and  the  reality  became 
increasingly apparent during the summer months. Central to the problems 
was  the fact that both Mark Butler and Dave Lawson had  catapulted  to 
fame and fortune within a few months.  They would have been super-human 
if  they  had not come to believe a little in their own  publicity  and 
both  in their different ways appear to have failed in coping with  the 
fortune.  Mark  Butler's  background after leaving Microdigital was  as 
Sales  Manager for Bug-Byte where Lawson also worked as  a  programmer. 
They  both left to set up Imagine in a small front room  after  several 
disagreements with the Bug-Byte management.

The  money  that sales of Arcadia made over the Christmas of  '82,  was 
reinvested  in  bigger premises,  personnel and in new programs,  which 
also  sold  well.  Naturally,  the  two young moguls needed  staff  and 
management  to  help  administrate the in-pouring  fortune,  a  classic 
situation  which encouraged the development of court chamberlains.  One 
of  the  first  such was Bruce Everiss,  who seems  to  have  naturally 
attached himself more to Mark than to Dave. Everiss was responsible for 
the  day  to  day running of the company,  but the  responsibility  for 
financial  control  and  a directorship was put in  the  hands  of  lan 
Hetherington. Hetherington attached himself to Lawson. The factions had 
begun.

One of Mark's hobbies is fast motorbikes. He created the Imagine racing 
team  and himself rode on the track.  In fact Paul Andersen and the BBC 
crew  were at the Isle of Man TT races in June filming at a  time  when 
Imagine was already in serious trouble and teetering on the brink of  a 
crash.  Mark  did  suffer  a crash.  Ironically,  he was driven to  the 
dismemberment of his empire swathed in bandages.

According  to Andersen (a view backed up by many other observers),  the 
two bosses thought that because of their success in the field of  games 
production, it meant they could handle all sorts of other businesses as 
well.  Almost  at  the outset they founded Studio Sting,  together with 
Stephen  Blower,  the designer whose art work helped sell the company's 
image  and which adorned Imagine covers.  Studio Sting was to act as  a 
design  centre  and  Advertising Agency for lmagine,  which  meant  the 
company  would  be  entitled  to an discount  on  ad  space  booked  in 
magazines.  In  return  Stephen Blower received a 10% share of  Imagine 
(which  wasn't  worth  all too much when the share  was  gladly  handed 
over).

Within a few months this situation had changed and the 10% was worth  a 
lot  on  paper.  The  triad of Butler,  Lawson and Hetherington  wanted 
things  rationalised  - ie.  they wanted the 10% back.  There were many 
rumours attached to the goings on at this time;  in-fighting appears to 
have  been rife,  but whatever actually took place the outcome was that 
Studio  Sting was left holding huge magazine advertising  debts  (which 
have  remained unpaid) but Stephen held onto his 10%,  although he lost 
any  executive post within Imagine.  He therefore lost control over his 
own destiny when management decisions led to its downfall, and is still 
undergoing  legal wrangles between himself and Butler/Lawson as to  his 
financial responsibilities in the matter of Imagine's vast debt.

In  a  telephone conversation with CRASH's Kevin Foster,  Blower  said, 
'Imagine  tried  to accuse me of certain things that I didn't  do.  For 
instance, they said I was detrimental to the company's image and that I 
was  booking  advertising space that wasn't wanted.  I was  accused  of 
stealing,  or misappropriating 10,000, and my wife was accused of being 
incapable  of  keeping the books at Studio Sting.  All this  was  later 
disproved in court.'

He  went  on to say,  'They were obviously after my 10%.  Imagine  owed 
Studio  Sting  89,000,  so the way I see it is that they  attempted  to 
brush that debt under the carpet.  The allegations were just an attempt 
to  condone their own actions.  I was probably the only one at  Imagine 
who stuck to what he was best at doing. '
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              THE MEGAGAMES

Late  in '83 Imagine had set up a deal to produce games for  publishers 
Marshall  Cavendish which may have been worth as much as 11 million  to 
Imagine.  Early  in  84  the  contracts were signed,  but  even  before 
Andersen  had  received the co-operation of Imagine to  start  shooting 
there  were signs that all was not well with the deal.  By the time the 
BBC crew was installed it was clear that things were going badly wrong. 

The  megagames  had  intervened.  Dave Lawson who,  according to  Bruce 
Everiss  always insisted that the programmers be left  strictly  alone, 
free  to create without management interference,  wanted to concentrate 
on  the  development  of  the  megagames.   Marshall  Cavendish  became 
disenchanted  by the lack of progress on their games.  They had already 
paid out a lot of money and seem to have been unhappy with the  quality 
of  what  was ready.  They pulled out and wanted their money back.  But 
Imagine  had  taken  on  more  people  to  cope,   programmers,artists, 
musicians,  gophers.  None of these was laid off. the overheads went up 
alarmingly.

Meanwhile  the  megagames  were  not progressing  as  well  as  it  was 
originally  hoped  they  would.  Andersen noted that  John  Gibson  was 
working  hard at Bandersnatch with lan Weatherburn,  but Psyclapse  was 
nowhere,  nothing more than a paper idea.  Yet at this stage the artist 
Roger Dean (famous for his record album sleeves and mythological books) 
had  already  designed the boxes and the ads which  were  beginning  to 
appear.  Dean  reputedly  asked  for 6,000 for this job,  and  Andersen 
thought he was 'smart enough' to have demanded it up front.

An  important  problem  with the megagames was  that  they  required  a 
hardware add-on whlch was to be made in the Far East.  To get the price 
right,  enormous quantities would have to be manufactured.  Imagine did 
not  possess  the money any more,  and anyway could not  have  sensibly 
decided how many games would eventually sell.  There was indecision all 
round.  Bruce Everiss was to say later,  'One option that we have is to 
sell the company as a whole to Sinclair Research and I've been speaking 
to Sinclair Research,  and they're not interested.  They're saying that 
they want to keep programming of that nature outside their company. '

It transpired that Sinclair Research was only interested in buying  the 
finished  product and that the megagames would have to be  designed  to 
work  on  the  micro-drive,   because  they  would  not  undertake  the 
production of masses of hardware add-ons. In the event Sinclair Reseach 
did  buy an option on Bandersnatch for the QL computer to go on  micro-
drive. [It was never released.]

Another interesting rumour that Paul Andersen's film team were able  to 
verify,  was  what  occurred over the Christmas period of '83.  In 1982 
there had been a software shortage in the shops.  1983 was to be a boom 
time,  and  Imagine decided on a clever ploy to foil the duplication of 
their  rivals' tapes.  Ahead of time they booked the entire duplicating 
capacity  of Kiltdale,  one of the biggest duplicators for the software 
business.  The  idea,  obviously,  was  to make it impossible for other 
major companies to get enough tapes duplicated for the Christmas  rush. 
On  paper it looked like an elegant a piece of industrial sabotage.  In 
practice  it  backfired.  Imagine ended up hiring a warehouse  for  the 
storage  of the hundreds of thousands of cassettes that they  ended  up 
with.  After Christmas the bottom fell out of the market, and there was 
no  way they could shift the games.  This was a principal reason behind 
the  strange  move  to lower the price of  Imagine  software.  It  also 
backfired  because they had flooded the shops with  non-selling  tapes, 
and  then expected everyone to like the fact that the tapes would  have 
to  be sold at a price lower than the wholesale price  the  shopkeepers 
had bought the tapes for in the first place.

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                            THE SCRIPT CHANGES

So  in the middle of shooting a TV programme about a company  that  was 
going places fast,  Paul Andersen found himself filming one with a huge 
staff  it no longer needed nor could afford sitting on a vast stock  of 
product  it could not sell,  with programmers left to their own devices 
much of the time and producing games that were increasingly  unplayable 
and usually released with bugs still in them (remember Stonkers?),  run 
by  a  management team that was beginning to fall apart at  the  seams. 

Andersen  recalls  filming  a  meeting  where  the  bosses  sat  around 
discussing  how large the megagame boxes should be whether they  should 
be  huge to entice punters to fork out 30 to 40,  or whether the  large 
size would put buyers off on the grounds that everyone knows model  kit 
boxes are usually full of air. And this at a time when their empire was 
literally  falling  apart  through lack of money  and  mounting  debts. 
Lawson  was buried in his megagames Butler was acting out the  role  of 
playboy  in his Ferrari and at the bike tracks.  Everiss was trying  to 
keep  the offices running,  while the rest of the 'top management team' 
struggled  to cope with the increasing bitterness that  was  developing 
between the triad at the top.

Some of the effects of what was happening were apparent to outsiders as 
well.  I  recall  visiting Imagine for a meeting with Dave  Lawson  and 
Bruce  Everiss sometime in late April.  Lawson never turned up and Mark 
Butler appeared for a few moments, having just popped into the building 
to pick up some petty cash.  It seemed a bit odd. The resulting article 
which  appeared  in CRASH naturally quoted Everiss the most.  When  the 
issue  was published Butler rang me to complain that the  emphasis  was 
wrong - it made it sound like Everiss ran the company, he told me, when 
in fact he and Dave were still in charge.

As early as 16th April 1984, a petition was presented to the High Court 
by Cornhill Publications Ltd.,  to have Imagine Software Ltd.  wound-up 
for non-payment of debts.  At the time of writing I have been unable to 
establish what these debts were,  or how they were incurred. The matter 
was  'heard' on the 11th June,  three or four days before the TT races. 
On  Monday 9th July at the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division)  a 
futher  petition  to wind-up Imagine on behalf of  VNU  Business  Press 
(publishers  of Personal Computer Games among others)  went  unopposed. 
Imagine was finished.

But  what  was happening back in Liverpool?  The BBC crew were  filming 
right  up  to the last moment,  and witnessed the apathy and  confusion 
that attended the last days. A memorable scene is the man from Kiltdale 
the duplicators walking up and down Imagine's offices trying to get  to 
see  either Butler,  Lawson or Hetherington,  the only people who could 
pay him the 60,000 owed by Imagine, much of it for the mass duplication 
done  over  Christmas in an attempt to prevent  other  software  houses 
having  games  ready.  He  was  in despair.  But Mark  Butler  was  not 
available, and the Lawson/Hetherington faction had disappeared.

According  to  Bruce  Everiss they had already made  their  plans  well 
beforehand,  and events would appear to back him up.  What he told Paul 
Andersen,  is  substantially the same as what he told me over the phone 
back in July.  'I'm not a signatory on the bank,  or anything, but I've 
had a look at the financial records of the company and there has  never 
been  a VAT return (Imagine had been running for 18 months  and  should 
therefore  have  made  at least 6 VAT returns by  law),  never  a  bank 
conciliation,  never  a  creditor's ledger control account,  never  any 
budgeting,  never any cash flow forecasting,  no cost centres, not even 
an invoice authorisation procedure. Just no financial control at all.'

All  these financial aspects were supposedly the responsibility of  lan 
Hetherington.  Paul  Andersen  recalls  that Hetherington  was  usually 
unapproachable during filming and had little if anything to say to  the 
film crew.

Is  it  possible  that Hetherington had already  sussed  out  the  true 
financial  position  of Imagine right at the start of  his  tenure?  It 
would  be  odd if he hadn't,  since the cracks were there  even  before 
Christmas 83. What must surely have occurred to him is that Imagine was 
capable of making a lot of money,  and that the megagames were going to 
make  them all very rich.  A lot of Imagine was now defunct and wasting 
money. Debts were getting to be astronomical, various attempts to raise 
money in the City had failed or been abandoned. If the company went, so 
would  the  investment in the megagames,  so too would  their  personal 
finances.

Everiss  again:  'Dave has become anxious about losing his big house in 
Coldy and about his kids at expensive schools and lan has become greedy 
and wants to become a millionaire overnight.  So lan has presented this 
Finchspeed  plan  to Dave.  Dave,  grasping at straws,  has taken it on 
board - which means that only 20 people will be employed.'
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                             THE RESCUE PLAN

Finchspeed.  The  name first hit the press after the Imagine  collapse. 
Finchspeed  was  the  new  company  founded  by  Dave  Lawson  and  lan 
Hetherington  for what appears to be the express purpose  of  acquiring 
all the Imagine assets.  As a result of canvassing opinion and currying 
favour  with those programmers whom Lawson and Hetherington  considered 
'sympathetic'  to them (rather than the Butler/Everiss  faction),  jobs 
were  offered in the new company to approximately 20 people -  in  fact 
those needed to continue work on and complete the megagames.

At  the  time the Finchspeed documents were drawn up,  very few  people 
knew  about the Lawson/Hetherington plans.  It seems Mark Butler had no 
idea  and Bruce Everiss certainly didn't.  'They didn't tell Mark about 
this  until  the very last minute when they let him in on  a  third  of 
Finchspeed,' Everiss told Paul Andersen later. It seems incredible that 
the  duo  thought they could get away with transferring assets  from  a 
company part-owned by Butler, without his knowledge. Stephen Blower was 
also in the dark.  Later,  he was to be held jointly responsible in law 
for Imagine's debts.  He told us,  'I'm still liable for the overdraft, 
which  was  112,000 at the last count.  If it came to court I  think  I 
would have a good case against them, as has been shown last time I took 
them to court. '

Blower  appears to have maintained that Butler and Lawson  should  have 
protected his interests better,  and the Courts have agreed. Butler and 
Lawson were ordered to pay Blower back the 89,000, but failed to do so. 
At  a  later hearing the Judge said that he ought to  send  Butler  and 
Lawson to jail for refusing a court order to pay, but they were let off 
on  the grounds that in jail they would be unable to put matters  right 
and  that  it was in the best interests of both parties  if  they  were 
allowed to continue their present work to be enabled to pay Blower.

Although  the Finchspeed arrangements were made in secrecy,  it did not 
quite  escape  the  notice of the BBC team,  who actually  filmed  Dave 
Lawson signing a legal document relating to some aspect of  Finchspeed. 
This shot appeared in the 'rough cut' of the programme (at the time  of 
writing it is not known whether it remains),  but because this deal was 
largely  outside the scope of the programme,  the shot is just there as 
visual background.

On a later occasion the film crew were also present when Dave  Lawson's 
wife  came into his office to get papers signed for a passport  shortly 
before  he  left  for America with Hetherington.  With  the  winding-up 
orders  going through the courts unopposed,  Lawson and Butler prepared 
to disappear from the scene.

On the telephone Hetherington told us,  'I didn't run away anywhere.  I 
spent  four  weeks,  day and night writing a business report.  I was in 
America for fund-raising,  and we were damn near successful, but we had 
to  have  our trip cut short because of the goings-on at  Imagine.'  He 
added,  'I'm sick to death of people insinuating that anything untoward 
happened at Imagine. '

In retrospect it seems incredible that they should leave the country at 
such  a  time,  unless one supposes that they felt unable to  face  the 
imminent disaster.  Protests that the trip was a realistic fund-raising 
exercise  for  Imagine seem undermined in the face of the  writs  going 
unopposed through the law courts before and during their trip.  As soon 
as  the two men had gone,  numerous creditors,  trying for weeks to get 
some reply to their demands for overdue payment,  were stumped, because 
with  Lawson and Hetherington gone,  there was no one able to cope with 
the  financial problems.  Everiss appeared three days later before  the 
assembled staff and told them in a brief speech that it was over,  that 
he  hoped they would get paid what they were owed if it  was  possible, 
and  that  he would try to find alternative employment for as  many  as 
possible.  During the period between Lawson and Heatherington vanishing 
and the bailiffs arriving,  life in the Imagine HQ appears to have been 
as disorganised and dream-like as it was in Hitler's Berlin bunker.  In 
reply  to  Paul  Andersen's question about  what  had  been  happening, 
Everiss replied:  'Well,  there was a whole pile of people just playing 
games  there  and they're hiding from the camera.  If you go round  the 
corner here,  by the exit, you'll find there's a big pile of empty fire 
extinguishers  because there's been fire extinguisher fights all  week. 
That's been the main event.'

As far as the BBC team could see,  the staff were mostly sitting around 
watching  videos and waiting for the end.  Everiss was left with trying 
to  find  jobs  for  about  60 staff,  those left  behind  by  the  new 
Finchspeed  crew,  and  in the end he felt morally obliged  to  resign. 
'Dave  and lan,  being too much of cowards to face up to me,  have told 
Mark that they wouldn't want me here when they returned,' he said.

That  was  largely  it for Imagine Software Limited,  but not  for  the 
people  involved.  Finchspeed  has  gone  on to  develop  the  megagame 
Bandersnatch  for Sinclair Research to bring out on the QL in  the  New 
Year,  with  a  royalty from each unit sold going back to  the  Imagine 
Liquidators  to  help  pay  back the company's  debts.  [It  was  never 
released.] It is a critical time for its directors, Dave Lawson and Ian 
Heatherington,  who are naturally afraid of any adverse publicity. Even 
as  I  was  in London seeing the rough cut of  the  TV  programme,  Ian 
Heatherington  was  on the phone trying to get hold of  Paul  Andersen. 
When  I  returned to Ludlow that Friday evening,  I was greeted with  a 
message  that  Heatherington had rung me to find out  the  same  thing, 
having  heard that we were writing about the story.  Unfortunately  for 
him  he spoke to our Financial Director,  and was told that as he still 
owed us 5,825, it wasn't sound sense to bother us!

We  phoned him on the following Monday morning when he spoke  to  Kevin 
Foster  and gave him the quotes used in this article.  He also  implied 
that  if we printed anything he didn't like,  we would be making him  a 
rich  man.  Indications  of libel actions are all very well.  The  fact 
remains  that CRASH,  along with other publications,  had been promised 
payments by both Imagine's promotional department and (in our case)  by 
Heatherington personally.  These never arrived. But at the time, he and 
Lawson  were assigning assets out of Imagine into another company  hard 
to  accept Heatherington's comments to us at face value  when  (whether 
intended or not) his absence put a total block on payments. Yet equally 
it must have been clear to him that payments could not be met.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                               WINDING DOWN

With  knowledge that VNU had succesfully issued a winding-up  order  on 
Imagine,  the  rest  of  the  company's  creditors  began  jamming  the 
switchboard to find out what was going on.  CRASH was one of them.  The 
official line was that things were quite normal.  But no one knew where 
Lawson,  Heatherington  and  Butler were.  Everiss told Paul  Andersen, 
'Mark  didn't  know where they'd gone.  The only person they  told  was 
Andrew  Sinclair,  who basically's just David's gopher,  and Andrew has 
been  spying on Mark and myself and reporting on a daily basis to  them 
in  San  Francisco.  '  One  press mention did  suggest  that  the  two 
directors were in the States trying to raise venture capital in Silicon 
Chip  Valley  to  save  Imagine,  but this would appear to  be  out  of 
character  with their recent actions in moving assets from  Imagine  to 
Finchspeed,  and gives strength to Bruce Everiss who said, 'All they're 
trying to do is finance Finchspeed with capital from San Francisco. '

The  significance of the passport signing became more apparent when  it 
was realised that both men had taken their wives with them on the  trip 
to  America  at a cost estimated by Everiss to be possibly as  high  as 
10,000,  and  that at a time when creditors were crawling all over  the 
building trying to get paid.

On the day Mark returned from the races, wrapped in bandages and driven 
by  someone  else,  he  arrived  at Imagine headquarters  to  find  the 
bailiffs  were  in.  One of the items they impounded was his pride  and 
joy,  the  Ferarri Boxer.  Paul Andersen recalls that he seemed stunned 
and  totally  out  of his depth.  He didn't know what to do or  who  to 
blame,  it seemed he was genuinely unaware that things had reached such 
a  state,  or  that his co-directors had fled the country and  were  in 
hiding  (as everyone said),  incommunicado.  So closely did the TV crew 
follow  the proceedings that they almost had their camera  gear  locked 
into the building by the bailiffs!

Mark went off,  to return two which they both part-owned at a time when 
Imagine was hoplessly in debt, and desperately required those assets if 
it was to have a hope of staying alive. Recognition of this fact can be 
seen  in that a royalty on every copy of Bandersnatch sold by  Sinclair 
will be going back to Imagine's liquidators.

Some  of the programmers are now working freelance on games for  Ocean, 
and others,  including John Gibson have founded a new Liverpool company 
with  partial backing from Ocean called Denton Designs and their  first 
game,  an  adventure  entitled  Gift From The Gods should  be  released 
through  Ocean  shortly.  Mark  Butler is working with  his  father  in 
another software company called Voyager.  Stephen Blower worked for the 
year  as  a freelance and is now at Ocean,  where he has recently  been 
made  a  director.  Of  the  collapse of Imagine he had  this  to  say, 
'Through greed,  or little boys playing at big business, or whatever it 
was  that  carried  it all they ruined something  that  was  worthwhile 
carrying on with.'

Heatherington  added,  'My attitude has always been that it's all  over 
now,  and what we'll do is quickly get our lives back together again. I 
don't  want people bringing back something that happened six  or  seven 
months ago. What we're doing now, Dave and I, is improving on megagames 
to produce something quite startling. We want to bow out at the top.'

In  summing  up  his unique experience in watching  the  death  of  the 
software giant,  BBC director Paul Andersen said, 'It was a fascinating 
time  in a city at the focus of the software business.  It's a shame it 
all fell apart - there were a lot of talented people there who were let 
down.  It's a bit like a movie that never got made, all the technicians 
and  all  the  energy,  but  the producers failed.  It's  going  to  be 
interesting to see what will come of them all.'

With the finish of Imagine,  the TV programme may have looked as though 
it  was  over too.  However Ocean bought a major portion  of  Imagine's 
assets  and  so Paul Andersen had a finale thrown in his  lap.  Filming 
continued at Ocean's offices in Manchester, as they worked on Hunchback 
II. The BBC may not have got the story of the Imagine megagames, but at 
least  they  managed to follow the development of computer  games  from 
concept to release,  and in the process they saw a fascinating slice of 
corporate life.
