            EDDIES' CAT UN-INTERACTIVE INTERVIEWED!

To Maggie  readers,  Eddies'  Cat  Un-Interactive  is  known  for many
things, including slagging everything  off,  going  on endlessly about
old video games, writing Donkey Island and annoying Tony Greenwood.

But that's not all he's known  for,  he has recently revealed a talent
for having no ideas for articles for  this  issue of Maggie and so has
decided to interview himself instead.  This  has a few advantages over
the normal Maggie-type interview  as  it  means  he  can  edit out any
boring questions like "What is  your favourite flavour ice-cream?" and
substitute more interesting ones. On with the show!

WHY CALL YOURSELF EDDIES' CAT UN-INTERACTIVE?

Well, my name's Eddie, my initials are E.C. and there's a menu heading
in the Maggie menu called  Eddiecat  so  I thought it was appropriate.
The Un-Interactive bit is meant to poke fun at software houses who add
the word Interactive to the end of their names to make them look good.
It seems daft that companies  who  make  videogames are ashamed to say
so.

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN AN ATARI USER?

Many years! I started off with an  800XL  when  I was but a small boy,
got an STFM a few years  later,  lost  interest in computing for a few
years and then got heavily back into it and started learning assembler
programming. My present system is a 2Meg STE with a 160Meg hard drive,
colour monitor and crap old Star  LC-10  printer. The printer tends to
make a noise like a cat trapped  in  a food blender when it prints out
but it's adequate for the odd letter and source code dump.

HOW DID YOU COME TO WRITE DONKEY ISLAND?

I've always liked adventures  and  was  rather  annoyed that Lucasarts
never did Monkey Island 2 for the  ST.  An Amiga owning friend of mine
told me that there  was  no  way  that  you  could  do graphics of the
quality of Day of the Tentacle  on  the  ST  so  I proved him wrong by
copying a screenshot of the game  out  of a magazine. Later, I started
learning programming but wasn't good enough  at  the  time to do a big
project like a graphic adventure,  so  I  abandoned  it. Also I had no
idea for a plot for the game.  I carried on programming and practising
drawing in various  paint  packages  however,  and  slowly improved. I
brought the abandoned year-old demo down  to the last Birmingham Atari
show and everybody liked it so I thought I'd resurrect the project.

The idea of the plot came  from  me  getting annoyed at the videogames
industry in general. There's three reasons for the existence of Donkey
Island. One, to make a bit of  cash, two, to improve my programming by
producing a finished game, and three, to  use  as a demo to get a game
design/programming job.

YOU'RE OFTEN VERY NEGATIVE IN YOUR  ARTICLES  FOR MAGGIE, ARE YOU JUST
AN OLD MISERY GUTS?

No, I'm a young misery guts! I  believe the only way to improve things
is to isolate the bad parts and complain about them. If people did not
do this we'd still be using  punch  cards on our computers because no-
one ever had the nerve to say  "this  is crap, it must be improved". A
lot of  television  and  magazine  journalism  is  based  on promoting
products, so you don't really get an  objective view from the point of
view of the end user. A  good  recent  example is the game Quake. This
game was loved by journos who  put  it  on  the office network and had
great fun playing deathmatch with  their  collegues. They neglected to
mention that the  one-player  game  was  pretty  tedious, because they
never had to play it like that, unlike the average guy sitting at home
with last years' low-end Pentium.

DO YOU REALLY HATE THE INTERNET?

Yes, it is hugely overrated. If  it  wasn't so slow and expensive, I'd
be interested, purely for  the  videogame/programming information that
you can access with it, but it isn't  so  I'm not. I've got a very low
tolerance to waiting around, especially if  I  have to pay money to do
so. One  annoying  thing  is  seeing  people  on  the  TV  get  whizzy
performance from their direct internet  link,  whilst  the rest of the
human race has to go  through  an internet service provider. According
to what I've heard, the lack  of  speed  is  mainly down to ISPs using
upwards of 25 customers to one  modem  which  means a dramatic loss in
speed compared to a direct connection. And only companies can afford a
direct connection to the internet....

WHAT ARE THE MAIN AREAS OF COMPUTING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?

Videogame history/theory and user interface design.  I used to be into
raytracing a few years ago, but you  need a pretty expensive set-up to
do anything creative without lots of table-gnawing boredom and waiting
about.

OTHER INTERESTS?

I like films and comedy. I also like science-fiction but not the bland
washed-out TV stuff, I prefer pure unadulterated book-form sci-fi.

ARE RETRO-GAMERS SAD DELUDED GITS OR WHAT?

Not really, some of those old  games  are  quite fun. There's a lot of
dross but that applies anywhere. What I find inspiring about old games
is that there was not the current  lack of imagination there is today.
A lot of people never notice how fashion-driven the videogame industry
is. Games are sold purely on "trendiness"  and not on any innate level
of quality, this has gone on for  so  long and has become so ingrained
in peoples' subconcious as to what makes  a "good" game that some find
the very idea of defying fashion  bizzare,  but people watch old films
and listen to old music, so  why  not  play  the best of the old video
games too?

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF DEMO PROGRAMMERS?

The best "demo" of a computer is  a game or application. What sold the
ST to people was stuff like  Dungeon  Master and Cubase, not crap like
the Lost Boys sprite wibbling screen  on  "Ooh Crikey, What A Waste Of
Effort". I don't have a  grudge  against  demo coders like some people
do, it just irritates me that 99%  of  them stick to the same mindless
formula of every other demo. You know  the thing, a new effect springs
up and everyone imitates it with  slight variations. It's just boring!
NOBODY CARES that your starfield/plasma/fire  routine has 99 more dots
in it than the last demo.

DO YOU THINK THEY'D BE BETTER OFF WRITING GAMES THEN?

This is the thing most people say,  but I don't think demo programmers
actually are capable of  programming  a  good  game-  they're just too
focused on creating fast  graphics  under  very specific circumstances
and so don't have  the  general  skills  you  need  to write something
playable. Demo writers are just demo writers, you can't change them.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF  THE  QUALITY  OF  THE  PRESENT RANGE OF COMPUTER
MAGAZINES?

Not too good, they seem to have alienated any intelligent readers they
once had,  by  turning  into  public  relations  puff-sheets  for  the
software companies. The single format  computer magazines are the best
in quality, but even they tend to  lack  the depth I'd like to see. As
for console/general magazines, forget it, they're all aimed at lowest-
common denominator 10 year-olds. One bad  tendency is the inclusion of
coverdisks/CDs which can often  lead  to  an overpriced bland magazine
which sells on the stength of  the  disk,  not the quality of writing.
I've been to computer  fairs  where  they  were selling old coverdisks
without the magazines, which I think says a lot about them.

WHAT ANNOYS YOU ABOUT THE INDUSTRY?

Geeks who write business/serious  software  and  then decide to charge
silly prices for it because  it's  "serious"  even though this sort of
stuff takes just  the  same  amount  of  effort  to  program  as a œ25
game.The repulsive move  to  the  passive  computer  user culture that
allows people to be easily  manipulated  via their ignorance, and sold
crap that  could  be  done  a  lot  better  if  only  people  would be
bothered.And the  old  chestnut  of  standardised  pricing  for  games
irrespective of quality.

IS ASSEMBLER PROGRAMMING DEAD HARD TO DO?

It can be tricky, the important  thing  is  to  take  it one step at a
time, and stick at  it.  As  with  everything  in life, practice makes
perfect. Read up on it as  much  as  you  can. The hardest thing about
assembler is not the actual programming itself but getting information
on the various registers in the  machine  and how to use the operating
system. One good thing  about  programming  is  that  it forces you to
think things out logically, which is useful in all walks of life.

DO YOU THINK YOU ARE THE  ONLY  ONE  TO  HAVE NOTICED THAT THE SCOUSER
SPICEGIRLS' LIVERPOOL ACCENT SOUNDS A BIT FORCED?

Yes!

TALKING OF ACCENTS, HOW FALSE IS CILLA BLACKS?

Even more artificial  than  Pamela  Andersons'  chests.(Note  for non-
British Maggie readers: Cilla  Black  was  the  cloakroom  girl at the
famous Cavern club where  the  Beatles  started  out.  For no apparent
reason she has mutated into a national television celebrity.)

FINALLY, JUST FOR THE  SAKE  OF  TALKING,  IF  TONY  GREENWOOD WAS TO,
PERHAPS, RE-DESIGN "HERO" WHAT WOULD BE YOUR ADVICE?

A logical control system  for  a  start!  I  know  you're  going to be
reading this Tony, and the  following  is  intended to be constructive
criticism, not a slag off, so calm down, call off your killer whippets
and pay attention...

1) One nasty thing on one level in  the original HERO was to have some
lazer beams that you  had  to  jump  into  whilst  they  were off. The
problem was you couldn't see them  on  screen  at the point you had to
jump from so you were randomly  killed  most of the time, there's also
repeat of this with the  dripping  green  slime  on  a few levels. All
sucesses and failures in a game  must  be  as  a result of the players
skill, not random factors, which is what that level design created.

2) The walking animations should start  off  with  a few frames of the
sprite moving 1 pixel at a  time  then  go  into  a loop of the sprite
moving 3 or 4 pixels at  a  time  until you release the joystick. This
would let you edge up to  things  by just moving the joystick slightly
(the 1 pixel start movement) and  still  move fast over long distances
(as you go into the 3 pixel  movement).  At the moment you tend to run
into things or fall off platforms because of the lack of fine control.

3) Do NOT lock the player  control out when doing movement animations.
Play the animation but if the  joystick  alters at any frame, skip the
rest of the ani, and start the new movement. With the present HERO, if
you fire at a robot, get the  controls wrong and fire above its' head,
you are committed to drawing the  gun, returning it then crouching and
drawing again, by this time you  are  usually dead. And make the lifts
stoppable at every frame, not just as they go past a preset position.

4) Establish a logic to  how  the  control system relates to movement.
Down should be crouch and  stay  still,  not crouch and crawl forward.
Use down/left & down/right for crawling,  as it easily relates to left
& right for moving  normally.  Also,  why  not  be  able  to fire when
crouching, from a crouch? In  other  words,  pull down to crouch, then
press fire to fire your gun,  instead  of the present clumsy down/fire
to do this.

5) Be careful of how  the  level  design  relates to movement modes. A
brilliant example is one time where  you  have to crawl under a flying
robot, and then wait for the  right  moment  then drop off the edge to
the lower level. With the  present  control  system,  you crawl to the
edge and stay there until you stand up.  So you stand up, wait for the
ani to finish, try and walk  off  the  edge  only to discover that the
program has decided you want to  use  the  look down feature so you go
into this animation, wait for it to  finish,  and yes by this time the
robot is back and kills you.

6) Add some sort of  visible  "blast"  to  an exploding barrier so the
player can judge how far he has to be to be out of range of it.

7) Sound effects are more important  than background music, they don't
have to be samples, simple chip effects will do nicely.

8) Make the game  get  more  complex  over  the  later  levels. At the
moment, all that's done to  maintain  interest  in the game is varying
the arrangment of platforms.  Try  having  different  baddies or tasks
emerge as the game progresses so the player doesn't get bored.

THAT'S ALL FOLKS!
