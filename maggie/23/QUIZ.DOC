Mostly  'A's  -  Pathetic,  do you think you are running a  charity  or

death, you part-timer you! 

Mostly  'B's - Better,  but only still playing at softco boss.  The way 
things are going,  people will trust you to stay in business before too 
long, and we don't like that!

Mostly 'C's - Ye-e-e-s!!  You are the ultimate software house boss, and 
will almost certainly be given a second,  and probably third, chance to 
do  it  all again,  as long as there are many willing punters to  stick 
their cash in your direction!

*Disclaimer for legal bit!*
Any resemblance to software houses beginning with the letter 'P' or 'I' 
are coincidental,  and an unfortunate accident to be honest,  albeit an 
unfortunate   accident   that  keeps  cropping   up   with   monotonous 
regularity.. Sorry!!
