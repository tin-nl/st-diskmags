                   HARDWARE REVIEW: GEMULATOR
                      by Richard Karsmakers


 At  the  moment that I am writing this,  I am  using  "1st  Word 
Plus",  via the GEMulator,  on a PC.  In the background,  another 
task is running - similarly,  a GEMulator task - which is  batch-
compressing  a  collection of documents using  "Pack  Ice".  Both 
GEMulators  have 4 Mb of RAM for ST memory,  though each of  them 
could  have 14 Mb if I'd want them to.  I can switch to  and  fro 
between  these two tasks,  or I could both minimize them  and  do 
something  in  regular  PC  mode using  Windoze  95.  It  is  the 
wonderful world of GEMulator that I have embarked upon, and these 
are some comments on said product.

The Briefs

 First of all, perhaps, a short introduction might be in order.
 Some of you may have heard my name before.  For the previous ten 
years I have been occupied doing a variety of things in the Atari 
scene,  most well-known of which are probably the disk  magazine, 
ST  NEWS,  and  a  program by the name  of  the  "Ultimate  Virus 
Killer". Last summer I finished the final issue of ST NEWS, and I 
have  in the mean time switched my Falcon set-up for a  GEMulator 
card,  an extra 1.2 Gb hard disk and a 28k8 modem added to the PC 
set-up that I had bought about a year ago.  The GEMulator is  the 
thing that this article revolves around.

 Incidentally, I am beginning to feel a bit like Metallica. Years 
ago they swore never to give in to MTV,  never to produce a video 
clip,  let alone whole series of video clips.  Now they have. And 
here I am,  known to have more or less solemnly pledged never  to 
actually  switch  to  a PC in favour of  my  Falcon,  now  having 
completely switched to one of those dratted machines.  It's  just 
too  easy to have all this stuff in one case,  instead of  having 
two  systems  and two flippin' monitors sitting  around  on  your 
desk. Besides, the Falcon wasn't exactly gaining value.

 Anyway,  I shall keep close ties with the Atari community for  a 
long  while  via continuing development of  the  "Ultimate  Virus 
Killer",  articles like this one,  and reading the various Usenet 
newsgroups    involving   our    beloved    machine,    primarily 
comp.sys.atari.st.

 Anyway!

 The  GEMulator,  originally  released a couple of years  ago  by 
Branch Always Software (now called Emulators Inc.) and programmed 
by Darek "Quick ST" Mihocka, is a hardware Atari emulator for the 
PC.  The  hardware basically consists of a fairly  basic  plug-in 
card that up to four Atari TOS ROM versions can be plugged  into. 
In addition to that,  it comes with a disk containing the  actual 
emulation software, "GEMul8r".

 The  version  of "GEMulator" used by me now  is  "GEMulator  96" 
version  4.50,  of  September 1996.  I understand there's  a  new 
version  underway (4.60),  but I haven't gotten my hands on  that 
one yet.

The Longs

 The  GEMulator  consists  of  one  plug-in  card,  as  mentioned 
earlier,  and comes with a manual and a HD disk.  Once installed, 
all  you need to do is fire up "GEMul8r" and,  well,  bob's  your 
uncle. You need to perform some initial setup details (whether or 
not  to search the ROM card for TOS versions,  whether or not  to 
search for MagiC,  whether or not to check network  drives,  that 
kind  of thing) and away you go.  Hard drive C is booted from  if 
nothing is found on drive A,  and that's it.  The disadvantage of 
this  is  that you will clutter up your  carefully  minimised  PC 
drive C root directory with Atari accessories and their secondary 
files,  as well as NEWDESK.INF,  a CPX folder and an AUTO folder. 
You can't simply create an ATARI folder and have that used as  an 
Atari boot thing. Too bad, but I guess we'll live.

 Everything works more or less the same as on the real thing. You 
can  install  various resident programs such as  "Let  'em  Fly", 
"Selectric",  "NVDI" and "NeoDesk".  It's pretty compatible  (but 
I'll  come  to  that later).  Accessories  work  the  same,  too, 
including the XCONTROL.ACC if you want to use CPX files. You need 
no hard disk driver (nor one for CD ROM), though. "GEMulator" can 
access all your PC peripherals,  including modems, hard disks (of 
unlimited partition size) and CD ROMs.

 Branch Always Software also supplies the "GEMulator" user with a 
program called "VGAWIN.PRG",  which is a special application that 
will allow your ST modes to use enhanced resolutions in VGA mode, 
as  well  as  the  Atari  utility  "MOSDOS.PRG".  The  latter  is 
important  if  you  want  to  convert  non-PC-compatible   Atari-
formatted  disks  to PC format,  although this  only  works  with 
regular disks.  It is possible to read "fat formatted" disks  (10 
SPT  in  case of DD disks),  but no "hyper  formatted"  (11  SPT) 
disks.  This is important to keep in mind when porting stuff from 
your Atari to the PC (unless you use a null-modem cable).

What about it then?

 Once up and running, you will find most stuff working. "1st Word 
Plus",  "Superbase",  "GfA Basic" (though there are problems when 
compiling,  see below),  "NeoDesk", "Mutil" (though not the "disk 
edit" section),  "Pack Ice",  "ST News" (in standard resolutions, 
with  the music turned off in the  configuration  file),  "XBoot" 
(though it is not possible to write sets,  damn it!),  "Calamus", 
"Ultimate Virus Killer" (though the presence of its configuration 
file  will cause a crash if you're using version 6.9  or  lower), 
"Backup   Destruction   Utility",   "Wowbagger   the   Infinitely 
Prolonged",  "Hiscore Terminal Utility",  "Revenge Doc Displayer" 
(though you need to do some manual tinkering with the NEWDESK.INF 
file) and a lot more.

 Stuff that doesn't work includes "Diamond Edge",  "ST Zip"  (but 
you can use Symantec's "Winzip", and even install that PC program 
as default application for Atari .ZIP files when clicking on them 
from  within "GEMulator"),  "Ledpanel" and  "Kobold"  (programmed 
much  too  close  to the  hardware,  I  guess).  Of  course,  you 
shouldn't  expect games and other programs that  directly  access 
the hardware (e.g.  "Spectrum 512",  or Falcon-specific stuff) to 
work properly. Unfortunately, "Maggie" didn't work either (the ST 
version), probably caused by the music. A configuration file with 
the  music  switched off by default might  fix  this.  All  these 
compatibilities were tested with regular disk access mode.

Speed

 Keanu  would  be fairly proud  of  "GEMulator".  Although  Darek 
Mihocka  rather exaggerates the specs,  on a Pentium 60  you  get 
something approaching regular ST speed.  Don't expect  benchmarks 
here,  as  benchmarks  only give a  numerical  representation  of 
things,  and  I think it's much more the way things feel that  is 
important.  It  feels  about as fast as a standard  ST.  This  is 
pretty fast,  I guess,  as every single neat 68000 command has to 
be worked into a clumsy Intel command before anything happens. As 
far  as I understand,  this is software emulation -  the  plug-in 
card  is only needed to access the  TOS  chips.  Apparently,  the 
latest  version  is  even quicker.  On a Pentium  70  or  higher, 
performance may indeed approximate a 32 Mhz TT's spec, such as is 
proudly proclaimed by Darek.

Problems

 There  are  a  few distinct oddities about  "GEMulator"  that  I 
really  can't explain.  The end of a file (as determined  by  the 
"GfA Basic" EOF(#x) command) is never found.  And the "GfA Basic" 
compiler  refuses  to compile programs unless you do  some  extra 
work.  A "FILE.GFA" file can be selected but the actual  compiler 
module will,  for some or other reason,  want to go out and  look 
for "FILE.GFA.GFA".  Quite ununderstandable,  though this can  be 
solved  simply  by having two identical files called  "FILE"  and 
"FILE.GFA".  It's just odd.  Another thing I noticed was "XBoot", 
which doesn't work,  at least not with regular disk access  mode, 
insofar as SET storage is concerned. Odd, too.

Concluding

 For those who have lost faith in the perpetually stable value of 
their  Atari systems in a world where PC systems are  just  about 
force-fed and any person with academic or professional  standards 
absolutely refuses to accept anything that isn't made on a PC  or 
Mac system, "GEMulator" is a good solution. It won't turn your PC 
into  a  high-end  TOS  machine,   though,   and,  unfortunately, 
excellently playable ST games such as "Llamatron", "Time Bandit", 
"Super Spring", "Bubble Bobble" and "Blood Money" will forever be 
a matter of the past.  Well, like the English say, you can't have 
your cake and eat it (the etymology of this proverb always eluded 
me, and probably always will).

 The  basic  reason why I wanted to get "GEMulator"  was  that  I 
didn't  want  to switch back and forth  between  two  systems;  I 
didn't  want  to  have two monitors sitting on  my  desk.  And  I 
preferred  to have all my text files and stuff accessible  within 
one system, Atari stuff and PC stuff alike. The main reason why I 
wanted to maintain Atari compatibility was that I didn't want  to 
convert  10  Mb  of hundreds of letters conceived  in  "1st  Word 
Plus",  nor  did  I want to convert my  "Superbase  Professional" 
database.  Of  course,  I also wanted to continue developing  the 
"Ultimate  Virus  Killer" in "GfA Basic".  For someone  like  me, 
"GEMulator" is a perfect if somewhat expensive solution.
