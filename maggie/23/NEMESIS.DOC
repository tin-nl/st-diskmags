                    Faster Falcons for fifty notes!

 1.4.97 note....

I  think  we  should get our corrective fluid out  at  this  point,  as 
although  we benefitted from Titan Designs generosity and  largesse  to 
the  sum described above,  I do recall seeing more recent adverts  that 
were  suggesting  a  retail  price of sixty  ukp..  The  'Fifty  notes' 
assertion remains valid of course, if you are a registered Apex user..

 Preamble....

There was a brilliant chap called Dave Encill,  who got together with a 
few other near-geniuses,  and they gave us Apex Media,  and Expose, and 
all  sorts  of  other wonderful things..  Now they also  did  a  rather 
stonkingly powerful accelerator board called 'Afterburner',  but seeing 
that not quite everyone was going to be able to pick up one for a song, 
decided  to try pushing the Falcon faster for the benefit of the  skint 
and impoverished masses out there.. 

Being a skink and impoverished mass, the Maggie Team start to take note 
of  stories that abound last summer about a new cheap accelerator  card 
called 'Nemesis'..  "By 'eck, that sounds good!", they say, in a rather 
poor imitation of a Tony Greenwood accent, "When is it out?"

Titan  make  reassuring  'soon  now'  noises,  but  they  like  to  get 
everything  *just*  right before they let it go,  as it is only in  the 
dying days of March that a mysterious summons to the parcel  collection 
depot sends me scurrying forth on a cold Easter morning..

 The physical unit itself....

There isn't a lot to Nemesis, the whole thing, instruction manual, disk 
of  bits and bobs,  and all fit inside a packet the size of a  hardback 
book.. The Nemesis unit comes in a sealed black anti-static bag, and is 
as  tiny  as  the initial pictures of it suggest,  mounted  on  a  tiny 
daughterboard a couple of small oscillators,  some support chips, and a 
generous,  nay impressive amount of wiring..  A second, even smaller to 
the  eye,  board  is the DMA buffer patch to help stablise the  Falcon, 
particularly with respect to disk accessing..

 How easy it was to fit....

(Or, 'Oh the stupid insane things we do to get good 'copy!')

As of the time of writing (1.4.97), this is where all the fun is taking 
place..  At this moment in time, Nemesis is resident on my Falcons PCB, 
it  is connected intimately,  and breathing gently,  whilst the rest of 
the Falcon gets on with things in 'normal' mode..  However,  as soon as 
we  try to wake it to do what it is supposed to do,  the keyboard  chip 
throws a wobbly and refuses to hand back basic control of my  machine.. 
Relaying  this  news  to Dave Encill and he advises in  the  manner  of 
someone  who's  already done this one and got the  souvenir  Tee-shirt, 
that  all  Nemesis needs is a bit of grounding,  it being sensitive  to 
interference and all.. 

Which is why I'm writing this very first bit of the review on my  rusty 
old 'FM, which has been given some speed-up pills to make it go faster!

With  regard  to  'fitting',  I  would strongly advise *NOT  TO  DO  IT 
YOURSELF*  if you are not familiar with ST or Falcon motherboards,  and 
aren't  sure  about  such actions as cutting  and  joining  chip  pins, 
soldering  wires  to pins,  cutting fine tracks in the motherboard  and 
soldering  to them etc..  This is not an upgrade in the plug in and  go 
class,  and  will  need a fair bit of time and effort to get done..  We 
thought we could get it done in a fairly long evening session, but only 
got   three-quarters   of   the  way  there   before   we   collapsed.. 
Unfortunately,  this  was  at  the  point just before  it  gets  really 
interesting..

The  manual  is well laid out,  and guides you through,  including some 
very  necessary  step by step testing..  The manual was apparently  the 
part that took the most time to prepare,  and if that was the case,  it 
was  time well spent by Dave and the team..  In the process,  I learned 
quite a lot about the Falcon motherboard whilst watching Nathan (he who 
is fitting it for me) closely, giving me the sort of perspiration worry 
beads  you might well get if you saw the ground-up bits of cow that  go 
into 'economy' beefburgers!

This  upgrade carries a real risk of damaging major components  on  the 
motherboard  if you are careless,  so I repeat if you are anything less 
than 100% confident of the outcome,  then get it fitted for you..  Both 
Titan and The Upgrade Shop are doing the fitting service, and both have 
a very good reputation..

One  small  criticism  I  must  make  of  the  'presentation'  of   the 
instructions,  is  that an extra modification to the Videl circuitry is 
required,  should  you  wish to use Nemesis in conjunction with an  RGB 
monitor.. The manual assumes that most people will be just using (S)VGA 
monitors  in  conjunction with Nemesis,  which I'm not sure is  totally 
correct,  but still..  I also get the impression that this modification 
might  well be missed off if it is being fitted by the fitting  service 
unless  you really make sure you ask for it..  Or is this just me being 
paranoid?

Anyway,  do  we have a fully Nemesised Falcon,  or a nasty repair bill! 
Read on shortly to find out!!

                     ***A A A A A A A A A G H !***

Well  it  could have been a lot worse than it turned  out..  With  Dave 
Escott  and the Upgrade Shop to the rescue,  I've finally had my Falcon 
with  Nemesis  restored  to  me in the early days  of  May..  I'll  let 
posterity draw a veil over the 'have they still got it or not?'  antics 
of the courier company,  who shall mercifully remain nameless, but were 
coming  perilously  close  to  a 'Parcel  Delivery  Cheese  Shop'  type 
scathing article in this issue.. 

Anyway, enough anguished hair-tearing, and on with the review proper..

 Some GEM Bench saddoes type stuff....

GEM  Bench  test on standard Falcon 030 running at 16mhz  (CiH  default 
setup),  somewhat  abbreviated as these things really go on for far too 
long..

GEM Bench v4.03  
============================================
Falcon 030 TOS 4.01
Blitter Enabled
NVDI not present
Video Mode: 768*240*16
LineF FPU installed
Ref: F030 + FPU, 640*480*16
============================================
Graphics:                            130%
CPU:                                 102%
Average:                             123%

As  you  can see,  this is with running my Falcon in a  favourable  RGB 
screen  mode,  which always seems to be a bit quicker than the  default 
VGA mode suggested by GEM Bench..


With Nemesis installed..

GEM Bench v4.03 
============================================
Graphics:                            178%
CPU:                                 167%
Average:                             175%

A  goodly  boost  for  the CPU,  which is what Nemesis  is  all  about, 
although seemingly not such a huge improvement on the desktop, although 
things like window opening and closing,  and screen updates in GEM felt 
a  lot quicker regardless of what the figures say..  This was based  on 
the  rather  so-so  standard GEM desktop in 16  colours..  Much  better 
results  for  the graphics tests would be obtained with  a  replacement 
desktop..  What GEM Bench does not tell you of course,  is that the DSP 
has  been accelerated too,  as the supplied DSP tester proglet was only 
too  happy to confirm that it was running at 150% of its  potential,  a 
mouth-watering 48 mhz or 24 mips worth in fact..

 The look and feel of it....

As  I  said  only  a  paragraph ago,  the  'feel'  of  the  desktop  is 
immediately improved,  with windows, menu bars, file selectors and all, 
hurling  themselves  into  their  tasks  with  renewed  vigour..   This 
crispness  even  continues  into the  notoriously  sluggish  truecolour 
modes,  and leads directly to one of the major selling points,  that is 
the  ability  given by Nemesis for SVGA monitors to  access  truecolour 
even in high resolution.. 

'Boring' applications such as text editors and the like get a  makeover 
and  become  crisper to use..  Even ancient software such as  1st  Word 
benefits..  Just  about  all  GEM  based software  will  show  a  great 
improvement,  from Imagecopy,  to Positive Image, to Papyrus, and CAB.. 
The art and image manipulation software able to use the enhanced screen 
modes provided by Nemesis..

Of  the  art packages within my reach,  Godpaint was a-ok running  with 
Nemesis,  also  Rainbow Paint 1.2 worked with Nemesis..  We assume that 
version 2 of Rainbow Paint will be fine as well..

Also,  Apex Media will benefit, being already set up for enhanced CPUs, 
and  the  Apex  Picture viewers are appreciably  faster  in  operation, 
especially with JPEG decoding..  We don't really need to say anymore at 
the  moment  about the forthcoming Apex Alpha,  for which  Nemesis  was 
developed in mind for..

Animation  players  are also able to use the extra  speed,  with  Tello 
Guillaumes 'M_Player' showing less skipping of frames on AVI  playback, 
which  is interesting,  as an accelerator of this nature would not show 
so  much  benefit  for applications using a  lot  of  disk  accessing.. 
Perhaps  the  total system speed-up made possible by Nemesis,  and  not 
just the CPU, helps here? The Brainstorm Movie FLI player also seems to 
be more comfortable if two or three animations are playing at the  same 
time.. The only complication with M_Player is that it has a falling out 
with  Nemesis  if it tries to force truecolour  from  a  non-truecolour 
video mode..

 The sound of Music....

The  news here is mostly good,  but here was also where we reported our 
first  failure..  Graoumf Tracker recognised the extra CPU and DSP time 
available  with  reduced  CPU load  on  several  complex  multi-channel 
modules..  Certain  modules that were pushing a standard Falcon  fairly 
hard  could  be played with room to spare now..  Digital  Tracker  also 
worked,  but with the complication that it always tries to access drive 
C,  which  does  not go down too well in 24 mhz high clock mode  on  my 
Falcon..  It  is okay with 20 mhz low clock though..  Protracker worked 
normally enough,  up until you asked it to play a modfile,  and then it 
didn't..  Protracker  decided  that it really did not want to  ever  go 
again,  a garbled screen occuring even with Nemesis turned off,  a rare 
casualty of this upgrade..

Also  tested were the NTK4 tracker which came up okay,  with most  four 
channel  modfiles showing a very low 2% processor time,  Bobtracker was 
happy,  as  was  Octalyser,  the  bigger brother of  Protracker..  Also 
Megatracker, another multichannel monster worked just fine with Nemesis 
in place..  Even the grandfather of them all,  Griff's original modfile 
replay routines, worked with Nemesis activated..

Of the desk accessories, 'Rape the DSP' seems to be okay as long as you 
don't swap around drive partitions and stick to the assigned  partition 
where  you  keep your modfiles..  FlaySID runs,  (and is playing  right 
now!)  and even the Cream SID player co-operated after an initial  bout 
of a juddery screen..

 Demonstrably Nemesis!

Alright,  what  you  are all waiting for,  does that foxy Martina  spin 
across the screen any more quickly than she already does in Lost Blubb, 
do those already incredibly smooth EKO vectors melt into  indescribable 
creamyness with Nemesis assisting?

Well, I have to say with many  demos running under Nemesis, forget it.. 
Demos  don't actually crash and burn,  merely run with garbled  screens 
and  often over-fast tracker music as well..  Just about any demo  that 
has had a 'Good' label attached to it at any time in its life, probably 
won't run properly with the upgrade switched on..  The classic demos we 
tried,  with  recent  Siliconvention entries,  do fortunately still run 
with Nemesis off though..

There  were  one or two pleasant surprises to start  with..  The  Lazer 
Symposium  textured 3D spaceships 4k intro does run more  quickly,  the 
TSCC  ST  based  Siliconvention  Bumpmap intro is  a  lot  quicker  and 
smoother than normal.. Several older demos do run with Nemesis as well, 
the Passion Arrival demo definitely being quicker across the board, the 
Pentagonia  demo  worked  fine,  and  seemed to  get  through  its  set 
programme  quite a bit quicker as well..  On the working list were some 
Fried Bits 3 96K intros, with Burning Water running faster, and Doomino 
of course.. The ancient Lazer demo Warum worked most of the time, apart 
from a couple of bits where the screen and soundtrack glitched, The ICE 
(Inner  Circuit Explorers) NAS intro worked okay,  and even the  Senior 
Dads joined in the fun with a fully enabled Anal Tuck demo!

Of others we tried, the Agony demo got halfway, and the EKO 'Papa was a 
Bladerunner'  looked  like it might go at first,  but succumbed to  the 
screen glitch tendency.. The one demo you might expect not to run again 
properly irrespective of whether Nemesis was on or not was the Abstract 
'Xperienced'  demo,  which  relied  on some  extremely  dubious  screen 
display  routines which didn't work with the majority of monitors  even 
at the best of times..

Generally the older or less intensively coded the demo, the more likely 
it  is  to run with Nemesis..  After extensive testing,  quite a  large 
proportion  of  the older stuff (1993-94) did run,  and often showed  a 
tangible increase in speed or smoothness in operation..

 Playing Around....

Another  major area of interest for a lot of people,  especially  those 
people running an RGB set up, is how Nemesis performs with games..

These  were  generally more co-operative than the  demos,  not  usually 
refusing to run with it.. Of first interest were the 3-D games produced 
for   the  Falcon..   They  all  produced  noticeable  improvements  in 
performance,  starting  with  Bad  Mood,  touched  upon  in  the  Atari 
Computing  official  review,  which  updated to the  screen  much  more 
quickly and starts to look like a respectable 'Doom' clone..  Of Lasers 
and  Men  gained faster updating,  but also gained super tough  enemies 
with  devastating firepower,  so a bit of a no score draw there..  Moon 
Games  (Moon  Speeder) was very smooth in operation,  positive  reports 
second hand (via Matt Smith) have also come back about Steel Talons and 
Gravon..   One  disappointment,  at  least  in RGB mode,  was the  non-
displaying  of Towers II under Nemesis,  it producing the same sort  of 
garbled  screen seen with running the demos..  A quick burst of  normal 
non-Nemesis operation saw that one all right again though..

Most  other  games  were expected to run faster,  but  this  would  not 
necessarily  be  reflected in what was being sent to  the  screen.  One 
exception  to this rule was Spice,  the Martin Steen produced  Defender 
clone,  which when run in Truecolour,  did actually seem to run quicker 
with  the accelerator having a direct effect on the screen  update  and 
general game speed..

Most Reservoir Gods games were fine,  apart from Skyfall, which gave us 
another  burst of that garbled screen referred to before..  Neurobotix, 
ok,  Llamazap  was fine too,  Killing Impact came up positive as well.. 
Wotanoid,  a game already quite fast enough worked too, and the demo of 
X-Moon ran too..   The general rule for most Falcon games, is that they 
run  with  Nemesis,  but without too much discernible  difference  from 
before  with  what you see on the screen..  Sometimes,  the game  logic 
(generating  bad guys etc) may be speeded up by the  accelerator  which 
was  actually  seen  to take place in Starball,  to name  one  specific 
example..

The  new  generation  of Falcon games,  such as Running and  Willy  the 
Adventurer should be ready to make full use of Nemesis..  'Running', as 
a  3D  Doom  style  game will be able to run   more  smoothly  with  no 
modifications to the game code needed, and the programmers of Willy the 
Adventurer are looking into adding extra code to make use of Nemesis if 
it is detected..

Obsession  and other ST based games such as Starball worked  fine,  but 
showed a screen ghost/garbage bug on the extreme right of the  screen.. 
Many ST games, such as the Stosser Soft games, run insanely fast in any 
case, and are better off without Nemesis..

Christian  Gandler's ZX Spectrum emulator with assorted 48k games  runs 
quicker with Nemesis on, y-e-s!!

 A view on diskmags....

But does Maggie run with it? The Falcon shell co-operates with Nemesis, 
although  certain issues with intros may need the intros disabling,  as 
these involve timing-critical code..  The ST shell runs fine apart from 
a strange 'ghosting' bug which is discussed in more detail later in the 
text..  As for other diskmags, and Falcon compatible ST-News issues are 
fine, ST+ (ST Plus) from issue fourteen runs very quickly, and with the 
right  hand screen ghosting that affects a lot of other  ST  programs.. 
Undercover magazine,  okay,  unless an intro gets in the way first.. We 
tried  issue  twelve  of DBA (Diskbusters) mag,  and that  worked  with 
Nemesis,  but a little juddery on scrolling down the menu bars..  Those 
diskmags  based  on  the  simpler  non-custom  menu  shells  will  take 
advantage of the extra speed available to the GEM desktop..

The  majority  of  diskmags aren't speed hogs,  and don't  really  need 
Nemesis..

 A quick word of reassurance....

I have been looking forward to getting this upgrade,  but part dreading 
it  as  well..  A  lot  of previous upgrades on any  Atari  have  often 
involved  large  chunks  of a  software  collection  suddenly  becoming 
inaccessible, as fairly drastic things have been done to the computer.. 
Taking something like the Afterburner '040 upgrade as an example, where 
it  is not so much a question of "What doesn't work on it?",  and  more 
like  "What  *can*  I get to work on it?" You can see  that  a  certain 
amount of justifiable nailbiting was involved..  Happily,  this was not 
to be required..

I  can report that Nemesis passes its 'Staying out of the way  if  it's 
not  wanted  test' with only one or two  isolated  problems  previously 
discussed..  If  anyone  has  a  large collection of  things  that  are 
unlikely to run with Nemesis activated,  don't worry, you can still use 
them with Nemesis turned off..

 All good news then?

There  are  some  oddities in operation,  especially when  running  the 
Nemesis 'High' clock (the only one people will bother with most of  the 
time..) 

The documentation warns that some IDE drives don't co-operate with  the 
upgrade,  even  running  in the 'Low' clock mode..  It turns out that I 
have  one of those troublesome drives,  (Toshiba 120 meg) which seem to 
stop dead once the 24 mhz high clock is activated, although it was fine 
at 20 mhz..  However,  any external SCSI devices are unaffected, and as 
all  the  vital stuff is located thus,  I don't consider it to  be  too 
major  an irritation..  It is considered a rare situation by Titan  but 
people  with large IDE devices,  or who rely predominantly on these for 
storage should take note..

There  is also a strange video display bug which affects programs  that 
run in ST low resolution.. A 'ghosting ' effect at the extreme right of 
the  screen appears as though the palette is starting to  split..  This 
does  not affect the operation of any programs,  just makes the  screen 
look a bit messy at the extreme right..  An identical bug has been seen 
by  us  before,  when  we use the Reservoir Ripper software  to  obtain 
screenshots for Maggie,  funnily enough this only appears with programs 
running  in  ST low mode as well..  (This may be a feature of  the  RGB 
patch, do (S)VGA monitors get this same bug?)

If  Nemesis  is running in the high clock mode,  there may be  problems 
changing resolution if you have one of the problematic IDE drives  like 
I  do..  In this sort of case,  it is a good idea to remember where you 
kept  the off switch or low clock program and run that before  changing 
resolutions..

Matt Smith, who also has Nemesis, suggests that a complete cold boot is 
advisable  if you are intending to run Nemesis unfriendly software,  as 
the supplied 'Nemesis off' program isn't guaranteed to clear the system 
on its own for everything that might follow according to him..

These are fairly minor points, and shouldn't really affect your use and 
enjoyment of Nemesis..

 Overview and conclusion....

Well  I've  had  Nemesis installed for a week now,  running  it  fairly 
continuously for most of the time my Falcon has been switched on..  The 
Falcon  has  been on for several hours at a time,  with not a  hint  of 
instability from the upgrade.. This goes to prove that The Upgrade Shop 
do  a good job when they install the unit,  there is even a four  month 
guarantee if things do go wrong again after they've fixed it..

Nemesis has proved to be unobtrusive and trouble free in use,  the only 
effects  being positive ones,  with only the odd isolated problem  left 
over, which may well be cured by progressively better software patching 
in any case?

In my case.  it is not quite the sort of thing I would leave in my Auto 
folder,  as I have too much software in certain categories that refuses 
point  blank to work with Nemesis installed..  I do keep it close by on 
the  desktop  though,  and tend to use it more for the sort of  session 
like  this,  where  a  GEM environment is involved,  and wherever  else 
possible  as well..  The extra responsiveness given by Nemesis  becomes 
very  addictive,  and a bit like getting your first hard drive where it 
is  also  very  difficult  to  go back to  what  you  had  before..

Nemesis  is likely to prove very popular even with people who  normally 
don't  rush into upgrading their machine..  The good value at fifty  or 
sixty pounds is one factor,  and yes,  people have been able to DIY fit 
them  without  problems,  so let's just say I was unlucky..  The  other 
major factor in the deserved popularity of Nemesis is the fact that  it 
does not interfere with the normal operation of your Falcon,  providing 
the  required extra speed without imposing compatibility penalties  and 
severely limiting what you can run with it.. Indeed, if Nemesis catches 
on  enough,  you  are  likely to see applications  and  other  software 
written  specially  for  it..  We already have the new  Apex  range  of 
software  coming  from Titan Designs to look forward to,  let's see  if 
third party producers and independent coders will take up what  Nemesis 
has to offer!

As an upgrade Nemesis has achieved better than 95% of my  expectations, 
which is as good as things can get.. Definitely recommended!
