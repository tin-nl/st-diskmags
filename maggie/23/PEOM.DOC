

The Best Scene in the World...

(Written in a fit of pique sort of thing I'm afraid..
and more of a song than a poem but what the heck!)

Promises made, never kept, Big talk,
but little action Revolution in the air,
but never ever on a monitor screen...

Oh what a wonderful scene that  we  have,  o' what a wonderful scene..
The greatest, the very greatest in the world.
If they actually went out and did any coding
people would think it obscene! (Chorus)

They think a part of them dies,
If they let their code be released,
So instead it sits there on their disk,
A slowly decaying Digital Compost!

Oh what a wonderful scene that  we  have,  o' what a wonderful scene..
etc (Chorus)

Many flee to the PeeCee,
Seeking a quick path to rehashed glory,
Little realising that
They are but tiny fish in a limitless Ocean.

Oh what a wonderful scene that  we  have,  o' what a wonderful scene..
etc (Chorus)

And when they finally go to work,
Old code, just lying around,
Slammed together quickly,
In a spirit of 'It'll do'!

Oh what a wonderful scene that  we  have,  o' what a wonderful scene..
The greatest, the very greatest in the world. (Chorus)

     What a way to begin  this *absolutely* ELECTION-FREE-ZONE that is
Poetry Corner.. thanks go to Cih for  his  lyrical musings - we have a
bard amongst our humble ranks!  He  has  cried "Off ye lendings!", and
"shuffled off" - if not quite his  "mortal coil" at least his 'bushel'
- and revealed the  trembling,  tortured  soul  beneath  -  a round of
applause if you please!

     Just one disclaimer - I do believe the above poem was written (in
a fit of  despair)  NOT  having  viewed  the  latest  Avena demo.. one
glimpse of this and (I assure  you) despair is successfully transfixed
on the altar of awe (Try it).

     Enough of this preamble..  on with the show!

 >Bank Holiday Monday down at PC World<

Like a bullet from a gun
There are so many on the run

My Nemesis Awaits,
Down at the parcel depot,
The mysterious legend springs across my lips
"First class, small package, registered Post!"



  * Nemesis Being Fitted *

 Old Falcy lies in bits.....

   Soldering iron spots naked circuit board....

 Talons flash momentarily in the sunlight...

   Soldering iron pounces...

 A Loud scream rents the air...

  Old Falcy wonder what hit it?

     I sadly have to inform all  readers  that CiH's Falcon was rushed
to the upgrade shop,  suffering  severe  internal  trauma..  even as I
write sundry dedicated Atarians are battling to staunch the wounds and
secure the implant.  But if  the  operation  goes  to plan, CiH should
soon have his trusty old pal back and  be brought out of the depths of
mourning where he has  recently  sunk.   Send  any Get Well/Condolence
Cards to the usual address.

     (Incidentally, it is at this point that the name Nemesis seems to
take on a whole new, terrible relevance.)

     Okay, did I say election-free? well  you can hardly have expected
me to be telling the truth, after all this is politics..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Election Blues..

     "You can only be sure with the Conservatives,"
     Warbles honest John.
     "Oh yes," we say, "sure of blunderings and bunglings.
     Sure of stupid glasses, the childish tantrum -
     "I'll show those nasty Europeans -
     I will, I'll tell my mum!"
     sure of mad cows (like Maggie Thatch)
     and chickens that hatch
     genetically patched.
     Sure of the Spice Girls'
     group photo, with jolly John
     while secret weapon Norma
     in her painful pink suits
     is sidelined as fast as David Mellor.  [-very prophetic - this
     And New Labour we love                  poem was written pre-
     of course                               election result!]
     as everyone does.
     The Blair Babes prove
     you don't need intelligence
     to be into
     politics -
     just bare some breast
     and you've passed the politics' test.
     So in despair we turn to extremes
     Vote for the party giving free custard creams!
     Vote for the one with the silliest name -
     Difficult when they're all basically the same -
     Vote with your big toe,
     Don't insult you head
     (and long-forget your heart)
     They're all just a bunch of identical farts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Okay so that was written in a  fit  of  pique  too and now I am a
little heartened, especially after  the  ignoble  toppling of Mellor -
OUT! OUT! OUT! - I confess to joining in the chant with relish, so let
us finish on a similar note:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Dear Mr Mellor,
     just a little note to say
     that we think you've had your day,
     (nice Mr Portillo knew when to slink away
     and footballers finish when they're too old to play)
     so take heart! you'll fit in well as a used car seller.
