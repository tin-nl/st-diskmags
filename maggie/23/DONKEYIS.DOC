                  Work in Progress version (21.3.97)

At  last,  the  waiting pays off with a first official preview of  this 
very  promising  graphical  adventure  with  several  sharp   satirical 
twists..  (Is  there  a  naff software edutainment  industry  sponsored 
cross-genre name for something like this, a 'SatiriVenture' perhaps?)

Quite  a bit of movement from the three-room preview that was shown  at 
the  Birmingham  Atari  Show last September..  The graphics  have  been 
revamped,  and  look  a lot more solid,  the screengrab in the previous 
issue  of Maggie will give you a pretty good idea what you get,  and we 
are expecting more background type screenshots to accompany this review 
in a Maggie exclusive sort of thing..

The game area is developing as well,  with a detailed room plan for the 
central character's flat..  As well as the richly drawn locations,  you 
can  pick up several objects,  but as yet,  can only use one (the front 
door  key)..  It is possible to wander outside to take in a few outdoor 
locations,  a brief encounter with a character close to many PC peoples 
hearts  (if they have such an organ resident in their bodies!)  A  nice 
garden with a gently playing fountain ('Nice water animation', as Fred, 
the main character says!) 

Fred  himself,  has some nice animation,  as the character 'talks' when 
you perform an action, or try to look at something..

This level of detail can even be found in a swimming goldfish in Fred's 
home!

The  other  notable  location is the high  street,  with  several  very 
satirical  shop fronts for those admirers of British high  street  shop 
fronts who often remark "Gosh,isn't everything the same these days!" At 
the  moment,  you  can  only  stand and stare from  the  pavement,  the 
finished  game  will  let you go inside,  and  conversations  with  the 
inhabitants  will form an important part of getting on with the  game.. 
Also there is a dead end trail in an adjacent alleyway..

Still  missing are the character interaction/conversation aspects,  and 
any  serious puzzle-solving aspects..  These won't be seen much  before 
the  final  game,  although work is very far advanced on these..  There 
will  be several minor puzzles and very obscure 'scene'  references  in 
there too, did you pick up the one for 'Lost Blubb' in this preview?

You  should  also  be able to do other things,  there will even  be  an 
amusement arcade with several daft and pointless games to try out!

The game preview is still silent, although Ed will have a little bit of 
help  there  from a mysterious person shortly!  There will  be  sampled 
sound  to  go with it,  with not even a drop of a recently seen at  the 
Siliconvention Mad Max soundchip tune in the game!

Best of all, it will work on anything from a 1 meg STFM upwards!

It will be shareware for a very reasonable 5 ukp!

Provisional release date at the end of April , we'll keep you posted!


      *Two incredible facts to pad out a fairly short article!*

1.  Ed Cleveland,  the programmer had the early demo version of this up 
and  running  a year before it was first seen in  public  in  September 
1996,  but  he  felt  that he did not have the coding ability  at  that 
stage to do a decent job, and put it on ice for a while!

2.  Ed does *everything*,  even draws the graphics himself,  which must 
make him one of the very last true 'one man band' programmers!

 CiH.. April '97
