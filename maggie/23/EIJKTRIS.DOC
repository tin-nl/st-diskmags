                               EIJKTRIS

                       A GAME FOR THE FALCON030

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Eijktris" is part of the "New Wave  Of  Polish Games" ( (C) Maggie ).
It is good to see  our  eastern  european  cousins  coming up with the
goods.

As you may have surmised from the title, "Eijktris" is a Tetris clone,
but a clone that looks a lot better than most of the crowd.

"Eijktris" runs in a  very  healthy  384  x  300  in true colour mode.
Unfortunately the slow VGA monitors  can't  cope with all these pixels
so the game is RGB only. (Cue much grumbling from Ripley)

"Eijktris" makes good use of true colour mode with a sumptious picture
of cascading waterfalls being displayed in  the background. As well as
looking great this adds an air of serenity to the game.

The rest of the graphics  aren't  quite  so hot. The blocks themselves
are small and neatly shaded, but  a  bit of variety wouldn't have gone
amiss. The fonts  seemed  to  be  ripped  from  the  ST,  one  of them
definitely came from "Wings of  Death"  and  I recognise the other but
can't quite place it.

The game itself is a very simple  version  of Tetris. If it were to be
sold by Kwik Save, it would be  part of their "No-Frills" range. There
are no power-ups,  bonuses  or  multi  player  modes.  It  is  just no
nonsense shape rotation and placement.

I must give a quick mention  to  the  controls. "Eijktris" can only be
played on keyboard using  cursor  keys  and  space. Oddly enough space
doesn't rotate the shapes, but down arrow does whilst space moves them
down the screen. Needless to  say,  this  led  to  a lot of confusion.
There are no options to change control method or redefine keys.

Like ADDSUB, there are no  presentation  screens to Eijktris, no menu,
no high scores or game over screens. Once you die, Eijktris just quits
setting the screen intro a  resolution  that  threatens  to blow up my
monitor. Never mind  bringing  down  aircraft,  the  frequency  of the
monitor after this is enough to  bring  down the space shuttle through
the roof of your house, so be careful out there kids!

Although the game has no extras,  there  are some additional pieces of
information displayed on the screen. As well  as the score, we get the
current speed which shapes fall  at  -  this  increase as you progress
further into the game. You also get to  see the shape frequncy - a bar
chart displays just how many  of  each  shape  you  have had. Just how
useful this is remains to be  seen.  You also get the obligatory "next
shape" radar, useful for planning ahead.

Unfortunately the  amazing  sound  capabilites  remain  vastly unused.
Totally unused in fact. There is no tracker music, not even an attempt
at a chip tune.  Nor  is  there  any  sound  effects.  This is a shame
because they would have added a lot  to  the game. Perhaps they sold a
lot of 1 megabyte Falcons  in  Poland  and they are being conservative
with memory.

So there we have it "Eijktris".  Although  I played Tetris millions of
times before, and this didn't have anything  new to offer I found that
I really enjoyed it. It  seems  to  possess  that special "X" factor -
playability. It really is an enjoyable  game. Perhaps it is because it
is so easy when it starts off that you are drawn into it until you are
hooked. In the words of Oasis, "you gotta Pole with it".
