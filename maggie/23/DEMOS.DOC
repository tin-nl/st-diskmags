          -= An article by NEV of 'Phat Ass Recordings'! =-
 
Remember 1990?   Great huh?   The demo scene was at its peak then,  but 
what   has  happened to demos ever since and why do they seem  to  have 
less impact  then in the olden days.  Lets take a deep exploration into 
the world of  demo  evolution.

Originally  a standard demo would be this.   Intro --> Menu --> FX  --> 
Outro.   Okay   so  this is a textbook type demo setup,   but it worked 
and  was  a  clean way  of  doing things,  but these days  things  have 
really changed.

Now    and   then   a  demo  would  come  along  that   contained    no  
interactivity  whatsoever.   These  were known as rolling demos,  where 
the user just  sat  back and watched the effects.  Each screen lasted a 
few seconds followed by  a  new screen.   The problem with this is that 
if the screen is  shite  and  goes on for too long then tough  titties,  
you  have to be patient.  But even  then it still wasn't too much of  a 
problem.

The   PC demo scene really started in about 1994/5 and is a  very  hush  
hush  underground affair.   The PC is being abused by demo coders and I 
fear  that   the  Falcon  is going the same way.  Let me  give  you  an 
example. 

There  was a demo on the PC called 'Caero'(I think,   don't trust  me).  
This   came  on a 1.44Mb floppy and was zipped.   You had to unzip  the  
file  onto  your Hard Drive.   This not only took ages,   but also took 
up 6Mb of space.  As it is 6Mb just for one demo is terrible. 

When  this demo eventually loaded it was just a one screen job,   yes I  
kid  you not, one screen, that's it! Sure the screen was great, but 6Mb 
of  drive   space and 8Mb of RAM to run,  this really is a pain in  the 
arse.

Anyone  with some PC demos will know what I mean.   There are a lot  of  
PC   demos  like  this  and  to  be  honest,   while  the  effects  are 
unbelieveable, the  spec needed is ridiculous.

The  Falcon seems to be going the same way.  I don't own a Falcon so  I 
can't   really  judge,   but  from  hearsay,   some demos  need  to  be 
installed onto the  Hard Drive before they can be executed and yes some 
of them only contain a  few screens. Damn.

Whatever happened to the days of Bootloaders and Fast loaders?  We seem  
to   be  making backward steps in the demo world.   Demos are meant  to  
evolve.   Take  the  old  200 sprites routines.   First  TCB  displayed 
something like 196  2 plane sprites on screen,   then other people come 
along  and beat it.  This  is good for demos as it sets the competitive 
ball rolling.

Sure,   if  an effect is large then by all means use it,   but when you  
need   some beefy specs for it to work then this really is starting  to 
look  like  lazy code at play.

Why   not  just stick to 1 or 2 disks (and no Hard  Drive),   then   at  
least   people  can try to cram more and more onto a  disk  instead  of 
requiring more  and more Hard Disk space. 

I  could  talk about this subject for hours,  but I think you catch  my 
drift.   Stick   to   a   4Mb 030 and only when you  have   a   totally  
fantastic  brain  busting effect you can consider maybe a HD and 8Mb.

CiH replies..

Sorry  about  cutting in at the end of this missive,  but some  of  the 
points raised really do deserve a right to reply..

Not  all demos are multi-megabyte disk monsters..  If you've spent  any 
time on the PC, you will have come across the small intro category that 
features  regularly in any semi-decent coding convention..  On the  PC, 
these  are  known  as 64kb intros,  the Falcon has  an  equivalent  96k 
category,  and  the Amiga boys feel confident enough to work down to  a 
40kb limit.. There, the coders are working to strict memory limits, but 
can still achieve amazing results within those confines.. Take the TSCC 
'Terrorise  Your  Soul'  Falcon 96ktro entry to  the  1995  Fried  Bits 
party.. A whole demo within that tiny space, and some pretty fierce and 
cunning optimisation to do it..

If  that  is not enough for some people,  there is the even tinier  4kb 
intro category! And once again, considering what little coders have set 
themselves  to work with,  some amazing results have been achieved here 
too..  See most of the '96 Symposium entries to see what I mean there.. 
If this idea of a Summer get-together at Dave H's place takes off, I'll 
gladly take the time out to show you some of these masterpieces of  the 
coders art..

For the bigger stuff, I'm not sure if we can go back to bootloaders and 
floppy only demos.. This just about worked on the ST, but on the Falcon 
and  PC,  you  usually  have much more data to push around,  masses  of 
picture  data,  textures  for  3-D  objects,  and often  higher  screen 
resolutions  to play with compared with what went before,  big modfiles 
with  chunky samples as opposed to tiny soundchip tunes,  often  direct 
from disk audio streams as well.. 

With all these heavier demands, you would be left waiting for ages even 
with  the best floppy based fastload system..  On certain Falcon demos, 
even  ones  where there aren't such top heavy luxuries as  direct  from 
disk audio,  hard drive speed becomes an issue, with slower older drive 
mechanisms  knocking  the timing of the music and  loading  of  effects 
awry..   The  average  demo  these days is a rolling  demo  where  more 
effects  are pushed onscreen and out again quicker than  ever  before.. 
Coders are very conscious of an effect outstaying its welcome, so there 
is  even more disk accessing than was the case previously which can  be 
put down to that particular state of mind.. 

With respect,  I think, apart from the specialised categories discussed 
in  some earlier paragraphs,  a hard drive is an essential part of most 
modern  demos,  and bootloaders really died with the halcyon days of ST 
demos..  There  is  no realistic way of bringing them back unless  some 
charitable  coders want to stage a singlehanded revival of the ST  demo 
scene in an authentic 'Old School' fashion?? 

Next point, I do agree with your point about coder's laziness, but hey, 
that's  the PC for you!!  It does also take other forms apart from  the 
olde chestnut of unoptimised code requiring a stupidly powerful machine 
to run it.. There is also the enjoyment blighting spirit of 'It'll do', 
that shows lazy design in its worst light.. Why code decent effects and 
ruin  them  with  piss-poor or  half-finished  presentation  and  bodge 
graphics for example..  This has happened on the various Atari machines 
more  times  than  I  care to remember..  Finally,  on the  subject  of 
'laziness',  why  are  so many people reinventing the wheel?  A lot  of 
recent diskmag intros, in the UK at least seem to be timewarped back to 
1989  with  their  big scrollers,  clunky fonts and  gaudily  preschool 
coloured raster effects?? Move on and do something new please guys!!

BTW,  Why an "Ex Demo coder"??  Your other letter must be an attempt to 
do something about it!
