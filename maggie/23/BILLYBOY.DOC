                   Another Stosser Soft Production

Tony  Greenwood is back again with what he describes as  a  'childrens 
platform  game' - this is Billy Boy,  which bears a slight resemblance 
to  the  Mario  genre,  and  is more conventional  than  his  previous 
ventures, Heartlands and Diamond Ice..

It  is also more sophisticated in design than some  earlier  releases, 
with a similar concept in huge virtual levels,  (that start off small, 
but  get bigger and bigger as they go on) but at the same time,  there 
is  a  lot more in the way of background scenery,  with themed  levels 
involving  a  lot of work for the artist,  and a lot of action in  the 
foreground  with  a  large number of  incidental  bad  guys  crawling, 
floating,  and  just  plain  shuffling around the level..  This is  in 
contrast  to the earlier games,  where it seemed the only sprite doing 
any work was your own..

At  the  same  time,  and in keeping with the  'childrens  platformer' 
theme,  the gameplay is considerably simplified from the grittily mean 
puzzler that Diamond Ice was..  The objective is a very simple one, to 
find your way to the end of the level,  and pick up a pink star, and a 
few other objects on the way..  There are other bonuses built into the 
game,  quite a few platforms that are a reasonable test of hand-to-eye 
co-ordination, and that is the gameplay neatly summed up..

Graphically, the established style of Dean Chadwick is once more, used 
to good effect with some very nicely drawn levels, whilst not quite as 
glossy as some commercial level games might be, nevertheless put Billy 
Boy  at the very top of the ST shareware/freeware tree..  The issue of 
audio  is  given  a makeover,  with a soundchip soundtrack,  but  with 
sampled spot effects in the game,  especially for the main character.. 
This  combination works pretty well,  but only on an STe of 1 megabyte 
and upwards..

Billy  Boy  is fairly fussy as to what sort of hardware it  runs  on.. 
STFMs  of  the 1 meg persuasion are fine,  but are sample-less..  Tony 
didn't really try for Falcon compatibility this time so results  there 
are likely to be patchy.. This game has *not* been recommended for the 
'030..  Billy Boy uses the available memory fairly tightly as well, so 
people  with  the  minimum  (1  meg in  this  case)  have  to  use  an 
autobooting  disk..  (But  if you want to complain,  why not get a PC, 
then you'd really have cause to moan!!) 

As with the other Stosser Soft games,  Billy Boy is Freeware, or to be 
more  specific,  Commentware..  Tony  has  taken the unusual  step  of 
disabling certain features to get people to write in to get a software 
key as he feels that not enough people are getting in touch..

It's really that easy! Go on, get in touch!

Ratings

Graphics:- 85% - Wide range of appealing hand-drawn material..

Sonics:-  75%  -  Blend  of samples  and  soundchip  music  work  well 
together..

Playability:-  80% - Pretty easy to get into,  might be repetitive  in 
the longer run, but you do have the incentive of exploring graphically 
diverse levels..

Overall:- 81% - A good undemanding platformer..
