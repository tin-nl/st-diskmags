     - An update to something we did originally in Maggie 17.. -
 
Fellow Diskzine Editors..

Now  we all know what the Internet is,  and the vast opportunities for 
'browsing'  many  many  interesting  textfiles  from  it..  We've  all 
'browsed'  something off the 'Net,  and right on to the pages of   our 
respective  publications,  and  we have cried "Lo,  here is a red  hot 
exclusive  burning  a  hole in the disk of our  mag!  Eat  dust  trail 
pantiewastes!"

And the multitudes cried back,,  "But,  like bollocks man,  we've seen 
those press releases three or four times already, and we're so Bo-o-o-
o-red seeing it all yet again!"

Anyway,  a  few  simple and elegant rules to prevent  'Repetitive  FAQ 
syndrome' may now be in order..

1. Repetition, for Karkks sake, look around to see if the tasty little 
infonugget  you  are  to devour shortly is not  about  to/has  already 
graced the pages of some other mag..

2.  Repetition,  lifted  this  rule  whilst the guy writing rule  (1.) 
wasn't looking and stuck it in my mag!!

3. Repetition, fed up yet?

(See  the bottom of this textfile for some more concrete  examples  of 
what *not* to use as someone else has already got there before you..)

4.  Quality  control..  Be  very aware of the limitations of your text 
displayer,,  Anything  that  does less than eighty columns  will  need 
reformatting,  as  you will almost certainly lose bits clipped off the 
end of the sentence otherwise..

Dontcha hate it when bits of a text are clipped off the e..
for example? I know I do..
 
5.  Speed  (is of the essence..) If you are someone who is  habitually 
late  with an issue,  there seems little point in including net  grabs 
from three months ago,  this may be rather boring to your 'seen it all 
already'  readership..  If  you  can get your issue  out  within  37.5 
minutes  of  downloading  some  'hot  news'  or  rumours,  then  fine, 
otherwise, a no-no.. 

6.  Quality control,  part II.. This time, editorial issues.. It would 
be  nice  to  sometimes see some trace  of  editorial  concern,  views 
expressed  concerning  a grabbed file,  interesting parts of the  file 
pointed out and highlighted,  contentious issues given their own spin, 
mistakes  corrected  or pointed out etc..  The majority of people  are 
happy to take these files unedited and uncommented,  either within the 
body  of  the file,  or in the rest of the mag..  Interesting material 
would arouse some kind of editorial response surely?

(I think 'Pure Bollocks diskzine' actually did add to, or follow up on 
certain textfiles, as I remember?)
 
7. Keep it reasonable and in proportion to the rest of the mag, speaks 
for itself really..

8.  Unedited press releases are boring!!  Nothing worse than having to 
skim  through the uncontrolled bnubunubnn(*) coming from the hands  of 
various  company PR departments,  all of which employ writers who were 
rigorously  screened for total lack of interest and humour  and  found 
too boring to work as chartered accountants..

(*) WHY that choice of word? Try reading it aloud and find out!!

Especially  with the Atari Jaguar announcements when they were  going, 
the  relentlessly bullish cheery,  and shallow approach sends my brain 
into  'Snooze-lock' mode for the duration of that textfile..  This  is 
entirely the fault of the people who write these things,  and may lead 
to people missing something really interesting and new that is  hidden 
in the bowels of such a turgid piece..

9.  Listings of things without any other text or comment to spice them 
up  are even more boring..  The very worst offenders are the extremely 
long  lists,  say,  of games which expect you to memorise some obscure 
and  difficult  to understand rating system written in  code  to  make 
sense of it all.. Can you stand 100k of it??

Well  that's all for that one..  I'm not having a go at any particular 
diskzine or individual, but just making a few suggestions to make this 
sort of material a bit more interesting than it otherwise might be.. 

                 ------------------------------------

Why  are  we reissuing this two year old piece?  Well there have  been 
quite  a few new diskmags which have started up since then..  Quite  a 
lot  of  them  do use netgrabs to form a  large  proportion  of  their 
reading  matter..  And  yes,  quite a lot of that is stuff we've  seen 
before.. Often more than once, which is too many times for comfort..

Personally  we  reckon that some netgrabbing is okay,  but should  not 
really  be  more  than 10-20% of the mag as  a  whole,  otherwise  why 
bother?  There  are  certain exceptions to this golden rule,  such  as 
'Warp'  magazine which is using certain specialised types of  textfile 
not often seen offline, which is fair enough.. We do suggest a careful 
look  at  what is to be used for other more general  diskmags  though, 
here  is  a list of those types of netgrab textfile where  we  suggest 
taking things very carefully indeed..

        - Netgrabs to avoid, or be very careful about using -

1.  Star Trek texfiles,  FAQ files,  fiction, convention reports etc.. 
That  goes for all permutations from the original series to  Voyager.. 
You  might  find an awful lot of material already  in  Keefy's  'Warp' 
Trekzine, or the 'Nova' sci-fi diskmag.. Granted there is an awful lot 
of  material out there,  but Keefy tends to have territorial rights to 
this on the Atari platform..

2. Red Dwarf FAQ, we did this one in Maggie a few issues back..

3. Anything to do with X-Files, arncha' sick of 'em yet?!

4. Any UFO/conspiracy material.. About three diskmags have already run 
roughly  similar material..  It's down to personal taste,  but another 
area where my eyes glaze over quickly..

There is even a specific UFO/conspiracy type diskmag now available for 
the ST.. Initial reports suggest it has been put together quite well.. 
So now there are *no* excuses for the rest of you to keep on repeating 
such material!! 

5. Aliens FAQ, ST Beermat did this one already..

6.  Look,  just might as well say be careful with any sci-fi material, 
in case it's already been used..

7.  Scripts from Monty Python,  Blackadder, Bottom, etc.. Already been 
done somewhere else before and a bit of a cop out too.. Why not try to 
be funny and write some original stuff yourself..  It gets easier with 
practice..
  
8.  Anti PC material,  anti Microsoft, anti Bill Gates propaganda.. We 
did  Eezi-PC  Maggie not so long ago,  which covered that  area  quite 
well,  or  so  we  think..  We also lay claim to anything new in  that 
department,  so  keep  off!  (Said in the nicest possible sense of the 
word..)

9.  The Don Thomas letter.. Anyone who hasn't seen it by now must have 
really been stranded on a desert island for twenty years!

10.  Textfiles  of classic copyright expired novels,  where the editor 
doesn't check the textfile to make sure it didn't get corrupted in mid 
download..  It's frustrating to read something and then @@DD3<<<< like 
L:L@  happens in mid story..  (Not mentioning any names,  but you know 
who you are!!) 

11. Most smutty joke texts.. Kelstar probably already did them..

12.  Computer  humour  or 'humor' with too many  subtle  transatlantic 
references  that  the  rest  of the world doesn't  have  a  chance  of 
getting..  *Unless  you're  an American diskmag editor  intending  for 
internal distribution only, in which case, that's fine!*

13.  Computer 'humor' which refers to ancient hardware or system calls 
everyone  has forgotten c.1984,  but stuck hastily in the mag  without 
checking it too closely..

14. Old and out of context press releases, I can trust you all on that 
one?

15.  Weird Al Yankovic material.. Felice inflicted the Weird Al FAQ on 
Maggie  18,  God have mercy on us all...  I don't want to see it again 
anywhere else!!

16. Any Simpsons material, Tronic already did this in his 'Typological 
Interests' 'zine..

17.  Frontier  (the  game)  material..  Probably  already  covered  by 
'Panther  Owners Group' magazine..  Some material is being  redirected 
from  Amiga diskmags at the moment to certain publications..  This  is 
not strictly 'netgrab', so is okay..

               ---------------------------------------

I  think that gives a good idea of the sort of thing that has  already 
done the rounds in the Atari Diskzine world,  and does not really need 
to be aired again.. Everybody is welcome to look around and cast their 
nets  a  bit wider,  and maybe we'll avoid unnecessary duplication  of 
netgrabs,  due  to diskmag editors all having very similar tastes  and 
not  checking  what material they've got,  and if it has in fact  been 
used somewhere else before..

As a good general rule, if in doubt, why not read over some other back 
issue  diskmags in your collection to make sure that the textfile  you 
seek to use has not appeared in there before..
