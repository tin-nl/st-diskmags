
                       The Falcon Games Digest!

                                 V1.0

                  Releases, prereleases, and rumours!

What is  the point of this,  you ask,  after all,  the Falcon was never 
really  marketed  as entertainment hardware for the brief  period  that 
Atari was interested in the machine.  Surely, all the available Falcons 
are  in  the hands of MIDI nuts who just love  running  mono  musically 
inclined appications??

Well no actually, there have been quite a few games that have arisen in 
the  four year period since the Falcon was released onto  an  unwitting 
world..  It  seems  that mainly by accident,  quite a lot of games have 
managed to surface (or not!) for our favourite bird..

This  guide attempts to cover as many of these as we can lay our  hands 
on,  or news thereof..  Not all things will be covered, nobody can ever 
be  100%..  Also,  we  may tend to exclude the very small previews,  the 
Mario  Kart clone with no readme.txt file,  the single level early demo 
of  Double Bobble,  Doug Little's SNES mode 7 style speeder demo,  that 
sort of thing..

You  may like to take note of the easy to remember scoring  system  for 
many of these games, based on the Atari Explorer Online method of doing 
things with increasing numbers of asterisks - * 

 ***** (5) - Brilliant/zarjaz! Essential even for game haters!
 ****  (4) - Good.. Get this and play it..
 ***   (3) - Fair to middling.. Worth a look
 **    (2) - Low average.. Only get as CD ROM filler..
 *     (1) - Shite/poor/the dogs leavings.. Avoid!
           - No mark, not enough information to form an opinion of the 
             game.. (Or not enough game if only a preview!)

A  good place to start is Atari's own official list,  in the form of  a 
rather nice brochure which was issued in early 1993.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ishar..
This was one of the few that made it on the official list,  Ishar was a 
relatively cheap and easy release for Simarils, with portover game code 
from  the  ST, and 256 colour graphics from the PC..  This game,  along 
with 'Transantartica' was probably the first official game released for 
the Falcon.. (See also, Ishar II and III, Robinsons Requiem..)  
Release date - Mid 1993
Status - Commercial
Availability - Not currently sold,  best bet through someone like
               16/32 PDL
Marked at - ** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Transantartica..
This  was the second Simarils Atari-sponsored release.  A similar style 
of  presentation  to  Ishar,  but  gameplay based  around  an  original 
Wargame/sci-fi/giant  trainset scenario..  Technically similar to Ishar 
(see above)..
Release date - Mid 1993
Status - Commercial
Availability - Limited, try current Falcon software stockists
Marked at - **
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yuppie's Land..
Now  this  one  was  one of the classic 'Lost'  games  on  the  list... 
Supposedly  a 'Sonic' style platform/arcade adventure using the  better 
features of the Falcon hardware,  and featuring lots of gameplay.. This 
one  was to be done by Eurosoft of France..  A demo of the game without 
full  gameplay was released,  and looked interesting,  but nothing more 
has been heard since..
Release date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial
Availability - Only a short rough demo in the public domain
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vroom II..
This  was going to be the follow up to the famous 'Vroom' racing  game, 
probably  the smoothest and fastest such game on the ST..  This was  to 
feature  enhanced  graphics over the ST version,  and allow up to  four 
players onscreen at the same time..  Several people probably would have 
purchased  a Falcon just to get this game,  if it had become  available 
when  it should have done..  Lankhor of France were doing this..  Until 
recently,  it  was  assumed  to be stricken,  like a lot of  the  other 
'official'  Atari  backed games,  but more recent suggestions have  the 
game  being  released  onto  the Internet,  whether this is  due  to  a 
decision taken by the developers,  or more shadowy forces taking things 
into their own hads, remains a mystery at present..
Release  date - Should have been late 1993,  has had recent release  of 
                sorts 
Status - Would have been commercial, now freeware?
Availability - Yes, with a modem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Suriya..
An adventure game,  also from Lankhor,  nothing more heard of it..  May 
have  had  a commercial release in the French home  market  like  their 
other adventure game, Black Sect did?
Release Date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial  
Availability - N/A
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Sect..
An adventure game, similar to Ishar and the like from Lankhor.. Preview 
screens were seen in places like ST Format,  but again, nothing heard.. 
It  has been suggested that this game did get a limited release in  the 
French market..
Release Date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial
Availability - Only by going over the English Channel!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Space Junk..
A high profile proto 'Multi-Media' effort that got canned early on,  by 
its developers Imagitec UK..  Atari were making a very big thing of the 
Falcon's 'Multi-Media' potential,  even before PC people started to say 
the  same  thing with their machines,  and this game was going to be  a 
hardware  intensive  (hard drive only) flagship for the  Falcon..  This 
made  a big thing of digitised models and live actors,  using the  same 
techniques  for  model making that the TV  satire  programme,  Spitting 
Image  used  with  a hellishly absorbing adventure plot..  A  demo  was 
released,  a lot of interviews and article space in the paper magazines 
was given to this game, but Imagitec decided to go for a PC only CD-ROM 
version,  which still did not see the light of day..  Imagitec suffered 
subsequently   after  releasing  'Rise  of  the  Robots'  on  all   the 
commercially  viable  formats,   which  was  a  triumph  of  hype  over 
substance.. We were lucky enough to miss out on that one..
Release date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial
Availability - Only a pre-release demo in the public domain
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Raiden..
An arcade conversion of an indifferent vertical shooter, which did make 
it  onto  the  Jaguar,  but seems to have got lost on the  way  to  the 
Falcon, although some people reckon it's in the hands of some publisher 
out there
Release date - Not yet!
Status - Likely to be commercial if it gets out
Availability - See what 16/32 PDL have to say?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Road Riot 4WD..
Another of Atari's 'lost' arcade conversions which has turned up  again 
recently..  This was based on the coin-op racing game of the same name, 
which  had 'Buggy Boy' style gameplay..  This one made it to 16/32  who 
are now selling the game, some three years later than it was announced! 
Interestingly,  this was also announced by Atari as a game for the STe, 
using the extra hardware of that machine,  but nothing more was seen of 
this..
Release date - Mid 1996
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32 PDL
Marked at - *** 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steel Talons..
This falls into the same bracket as Road Riot 4WD and Raiden, and again 
has  turned  up in the hands of 16/32 PDL..  An arcade  Helicopter  3-D 
game,  with  some  fairly indifferent 3-D routines..  Also,  another one 
which  had been touted for release in an STe version,  but that  didn't 
see  the light of day..  There was a 'naughty' version that went around 
the  bulletin  boards sometime before,  but without a Jaguar Joypad  to 
play it, the game was somewhat useless.. 
Release date - 1995?
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32 PDL
Marked at - **
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cyber Assault..
Now  this  was a total mystery package..  Memory suggests it was a  3-D 
game,  with  the player controlling a little polygon stick figure,  who 
indulged  in various acts of mayhem and destruction in a similar  style 
to the rather nice ST game 'Hunter'.. It was to be done by Koveos (UK), 
the people who did Steel Talons, but nothing more heard about it??
Release date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial
Availability - Forget it
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tornado Flight Simulator..
Now  this  was going to be another good one from the  kings  of  flight 
sims,  Digital  Integration..  The PC version used 256 colour graphics, 
and had good 3-D landscaping techniques for the period (early 1993) and 
would  have  been  a  hit on the Falcon..  This may have  been  in  the 
'written but not released' category??
Release date - N/A
Status - Commercial if it had been released
Availability - Nope!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Striker..
Footy game by Rage (UK), sunk completely out of sight..
Release date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial etc
Availability - This didn't even get a rumour to itself!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Eclipse..
Another  mystery  game,  that was announced as an advanced  space  type 
game,  using the very advanced bits of the Falcon , such as the DSP and 
so on.. This was in the hands of Eclipse, former Thalion coders, and ex 
demo  coders who would have done something truly amazing,  if the  game 
had  actually existed..  A short rolling demo was eventually  released, 
which fell far below expectations..  By that time,  Eclipse had decided 
that  the  Falcon  was not commercially viable,  and had  thrown  their 
weight behind the Jaguar Console.. 'Iron Soldier' was the end result.. 
Release date - N/A
Status -- Commercial, I guess
Availability - N/A, a development footnote to their Jaguar game?

*Trivia Footnote*
Some  of the projects that Thalion/Eclipse were looking at  included  a 
texture-mapped  3-D roleplaying game on the ST,  and something  similar 
but quite a bit quicker for the Falcon?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Humans..
Sometimes  known as Evolution Dino Dudes..  This was another one  which 
was  completed  but  not  seen  for ages  until  16/32  took  over  the 
publishing rights from Atari, and eventually released this game.. Based 
on  a  Lemmings style plot,  this game also appeared on  several  other 
formats, including a release on the Jaguar Console..
Release Date - Late 1995
Status - Commercial
Availability - See 16/32
Marked at - ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daughters of Serpents..
An  adventure  game from Millenium UK..  Got as far as  PC  screenshots 
being seen in ST format, but no further..
Release date - N/A
Status - Commercial
Availabilty - Not really
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rome AD72..
The  second Millenium UK game,  all comments for Daughters of  Serpents 
applicable to this game as well..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Harrier AV8..
A  conversion of a PC based Harrier flight sim from Domark.  Presumably 
got canned at an early stage by them??
Release date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial
Availability - N/A
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Chaos Engine..  
This would have been the Bitmap Bros first involvement with the Falcon, 
a  conversion of the ST 'Chaos Engine' game with 256 colour  graphics.. 
Unfortunately,  Atari  insisted  that  the game had to  work  with  the 
mythical  1MB  'consumer' version of the Falcon,  and the Bitmaps  said 
they  needed  2MB of memory otherwise there would be no  room  for  the 
enhanced graphics.. How about putting 2MB in your base model to give us 
a chance,  they said..  Tough, Atari said, 1MB is going to be your lot! 
The  game never got released,  although it was suggested that the  main 
game  code had been completed,  and the game *could* have been finished 
after all??
Release date - N/A
Status - Should have been commercial
Availability - Not likely to see this one ever
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two more not on the list, but official Atari projects..
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Legends of Valour..
The  *big*  PC adventure game of 1993,  with advanced  texture  mapping 
techiques,  multiple  character  interaction,  and a huge virtual  game 
world  to  explore..  This game did make it onto the ST in a 16  colour 
format, and worked reasonably well.. (I have seen a hacked version that 
runs  a lot quicker on the Falcon's 16 mhz!) If this had been  released 
for the Falcon,  it would have been one of the better games to come out 
for  it..  The  tale as to why it did not is tragic and pointless,  and 
boils  down  to a personal disagreement between the heads  of  software 
development  at  Atari  and  US Gold..  As both  gentlemen  refused  to 
acknowledge each others existence,  Falcon development hardware did not 
make  it  across to US Gold..  The overt cause of the problem being  an 
unsigned bit of paper!!
Release date - N/A
Status - Would have been commercial
Availability - Lost through sheer stupidity!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Llamazap..
Another  long  awaited,   lost,  and  resurrected  product..  This  was 
extensively  previewed  as  an arcade game written by  that  long  time 
coding  guru,  Jeff  Minter..  Another  one which was dragged from  the 
basement  by  16/32,  and was the first of the 'Lost' Atari  releases.. 
There were also beta-test versions going around for a long time  before 
in  an  unauthorised fashion,  but like Steel Talons,  this needed  the 
Jaguar Joypad to work.. 
Release date - End of 1994
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32, in a nice video case!
Marked at - **** for arcade fans
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things  get  a  bit easier now,  with the final generation  of  overtly 
commercial  games  that  were written for the STe,  but  quite  handily 
worked on the Falcon too.. Many of these were very well produced, and a 
worthy send-off for the STe,  and quite good on the Falcon too..  (Yes, 
pushing  the  definition  of Falcon game a bit,  but these  either  had 
Falcon versions planned, or benefited in some way from the '030..)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Obsession (Falcon version aborted)
This  emerged in late 1994 through the good offices of Merlin PDL,  one 
of  the  most active supporters of the Atari scene at  one  point,  but 
sadly no more now..  Obsession was the debut effort of the Swedish team 
known  as Unique Developments..  This was an Amiga quality pinball sim, 
and  more playable than most..  A Falcon enhanced version was  promised 
for a long time, dropped by Unique Developments, resurrected by Merlin, 
and then quietly abandoned again.. 
Release date - Late 1994
Status - Commercial
Availability - Since Merlin's demise, any good Atari Boxshifter?
Marked at - ****
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Substation
This was Unique's second and final game on the Atari, and was the first 
stab at a decent 'Doom' clone on the STe and Falcon. A grey and murkily 
atmospheric environment,  out-of-your-head stereo sound imaging,  and a 
taughtly structured game style gave future 'Doom' clone makers a lot to 
look up to..  A deathmatch multiplayer link-up was included,  just like 
the real thing.. Would have been even better with proper texture mapped 
graphics on the Falcon, there was an isolated rumour for the production 
of such a version, but it came to naught..
Release Date - Mid 1995
Status - Commercial
Availability - See 'Obsession' entry immediately above..
Marked at - ****
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stardust
An Amiga port-over,  and rather a good one..  Produced by Team 17, many 
of  these  better known as members of the demo group  Aggression,  this 
vastly  superior interpretation of the classic Asteroids game  made  an 
appearance  in  summer  1995..   Presentation  was  top  notch  in  all 
departments,  the only grating point for many Falcon owners was that it 
was copy protected and bootloaded from floppy like old style commercial 
games, refusing to install to hard disk..
Release Date - Mid 1995
Status - Commercial
Availability - Since Daze Marketing,  the original distributors, pulled 
out of Atari games, it falls to the usual boxshifters again..
Marked at - **** (would be five but for fiddly bootloading)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rock 'n Roll Clams
Caspian  Software  had a shortish involvement with the  Atari  Software 
market..  Their first effort,  Rock and Roll Clams, was no way a Falcon 
project,  but  was  intended  to  run on anything from  a  1  meg  STFM 
upwards..  This bouncy platform game,  was, if anything, a bit too fast 
on the Falcon and playability suffered a bit as a result..
Release Date - Late 1993
Status - Commercial
Availability - A few old copies hanging around..
Marked at - ***
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Zero 5
This  was  Caspian's flagship project..  A sort of grand  sweeping  3-D 
space  shootemup  game which ran on the STe and Falcon..  The  3-D  was 
state of the art for the STe, but also benefited from the Falcons extra 
speed,  although  the  texture-mapping was primitive and fell short  of 
what is expected now..  Mayhem fans looking for a thrill without having 
to think about it too hard would still enjoy this game.. 

*An  interesting sequel was that this game was put into  pre-production 
as a massively enhanced Jaguar title.. Even the JTS merger may not stop 
this game coming out shortly! More news here appreciated..*

*More news now got! Check out the interview text in this issue!

Release Date - Late 1994

Availability - Wherever you can find Atari software on sale still?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Team
This  supreme  footy  game fell into the final generation  of  the  STe 
blessed,  as it used the hardware features of both machines such as the 
blitter and hardscroll to good effect.. Memorable as a superb effort on 
STe,  a  Falcon  version with enhanced 256 colour graphics,  and 16-bit 
sound was planned,  but came to naught..  Local boys,  Impact Software, 
made good, but didn't make any more.. Pity..

There  were  three other Simarils Falcon games,  which at least  showed 
that they were prepared to stick with the commercial Atari market until 
the bitter end, even if these were ST/PC portovers again..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ishar II
The sequel to the first Ishar, with releases on both the ST, and Falcon 
with  enhanced colours..  A similar theme to the first game,  only more 
so..
Release Date - Sometime after Ishar 1
Status - Commercial
Availability - Boxshifters,  most recently as part of a trilogy for all 
three Ishar games..
Marked at - **
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ishar III
The final part of the Ishar trilogy, with digitised graphics instead of 
the had drawn material found in the other two games, otherwise business 
as usual..
Release Date - 1995, I think
Status - Commercial
Availability - See above
Marked at - zzzz!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robinsons Requiem
Simarils do something different at last!  Still adventure based,  but a 
ferociously  plot-packed  survival  sim,  also  noteworthy  for  having 
absolutely  no  dragons,  knights,  or  orcs..  It also had a very slow 
genuine  3-D landscape which meant that the game ran at a crawl  unless 
you were in very low detail.. One for advanced hypochondriacs who don't 
mind unoptimised portovers from the PC..
Release Date - About the same time as Ishar III
Status - Commercial
Availability - see the other two entries above
Marked at - *** 

*Both  this  game  and  Ishar  III were  also  released  on  a  CD-ROM, 
presumably with extra animation sequences, more graphics etc.. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Reservoir Gods.  
These  people are very well known to us,  and are noteworthy for  being 
one of the more prolific Falcon games producers,  with about four and a 
half major releases,  and still more in the pipeline.. Their very major 
involvement  with  Maggie need not really be gone  into  detail  here.. 
Needless to say, if you rearrange the letters of their name, and change 
the alphabet you're using, they end up spelling 'Success'.. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------   
Tautology
Their debut into the Falcon arena,  with a 'Match-it' or Shanghai clone 
on  the  Falcon..  A nicely presented little game,  but according to Mr 
Pink,  mainly  notable as a piece of code where a lot of useful lessons 
were learned for the future..
Release Date - Mid 1994
Status - Freeware
Availability - almost any good place where Atari software collects, now 
superceded by Tautology II..
Marked at  - ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tautology II
This appeared a year after the original, and was first seen at the 1995 
Fried  Bits  Convention..  This was the upgrade to Tautology  that  the 
world had been waiting for,  keeping the gameplay and essentials of the 
original,   but   really   turning   up  the  presentation   and   user 
friendliness..  Several new tile sets,  vastly improved interface,  VGA 
compatibility, and more..
Release Date - Mid 1995
Status - Shareware
Availability - C'mon, you mean to say you haven't got this one yet!
Marked at  - **** 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Double Bobble
This  was the Res Gods first major release,  and it had quite a history 
before  it  made  it out..  The intention was to produce  a  Falconised 
TrueColour  'Bubble  Bobble'  in its entirety..  On the way,  this  was 
almost  adopted  by  Merlin PDL as a big name  release  alongside  such 
commercial  classics  as  Obsession  et  al..  Unfortunately,  a  quick 
namecheck with Taito, the holders of the Bubble Bobble licence revealed 
that  we  were all playing out of our league,  as a very large  sum  of 
money  was demanded for this bubble popping intellectual  property..  A 
swift name change later meant that Double Bobble reverted to a slightly 
dubious name and shareware status..  People who paid up got another 100 
levels worth, which was pretty decent of Mr Pink and co..
Release Date - Mid/late 1995
Status - Shareware
Availability - Yes, very widely..
Marked at - **** and a half
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Skyfall
This followed on from Double Bobble, and represented yet another change 
of pace for the Reservoir funsters, as probably the ultimate in Columns 
game based madness..  Up to four players,  User definable options until 
the game ran back to front,  lovely object design, crap, er sorry 'cult 
speech  samples  from Mr Pink,  and a killer soundtrack by Mr  Sh3  all 
gelled  together  to  combine  in this game,  first seen  at  the  1996 
Symposium Party..
Release Date - Spring 1996
Status, - Shareware
Availability - Like the other games, you can't miss this one really..
Marked at - ****
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sworm
This relatively minor game, sort of a William Shakespeare does a Johnny 
Fartpants   story  in  Viz  magazine  style  production,   only  slowly 
appeared..  Produced  in  summer  1996  as part of  a  24  hour  coding 
competition,  this  move the worm around the screen and don't bump into 
his expanding tail-o-thon turned up in summer 1996..  A good effort for 
a 24 hour competition, and a bit of harmless fun after all..
Release Date - later part of 1996, this one escaped!
Status - Ohh, freeeware I think
Availability  -  Not so easy to find as the others,  but look  around..

*Fascinating Postscript..  You might ask what happened to the other two 
Worms games that were produced at the same event??
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Spyhunt/Republic (coming soon)
Their  newest  game,  based on the coin-op/classic 8-Bit  overhead  car 
chase game has a very long history,  as a very small level demonstrator 
has  existed  as long as the first Bubble Bobble pieces of  code..  The 
mature form of this game started to appear in the latter half of  1996, 
and  expands from the basic form of the arcade original quite  a  lot.. 
This has a (very) provisional late April release date,  and will almost 
certainly  be  shareware..  The  recent name change  to  'Republic'  is 
intended to avoid any 'Double Bobble' style naming hassles,  even if it 
makes it sound like a wargame or strategy sim based on Ancient Rome..
Release Date - Stand by!
Status - Shareware
Availability - The usual places
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Next  up,  are the various attempts at doing a 'Doom' or  'Wolfenstein' 
clone  on  the Falcon..  An awful lot have been started but only a  few 
have managed to get anywhere near completion.. Here are their stories..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Of Lasers and Men
This  very  first major effort started off  promisingly,  with  author, 
Arnaud  Linz  releasing  a pre-preview into  the  public  domain,  that 
slightly  predated  ID Software's 'Doom'..  Partial  texturing,  ripped 
'Wolfenstein graphics,  and a reasonable turn of speed gave way to full 
texturing,  hand-drawn  (eventually)  graphics,  and  a fatal  drop  in 
speed..  This  was  a  much tenser affair than  normal,  and  genuinely 
capable  of  making  the  hairs stand up on the  back  of  your  neck.. 
However,  it  was let down by too low a framerate in the crucial combat 
bits..
Release Date - First saw daylight in 1994
Status - Shareware, not sure if author still active now?
Availability - Wide
Marked at - **  (more with suitable CPU accelerator)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bad Mood
It was only a matter of time before someone would attempt to tackle the 
subject  of  'Doom'  head-on,  and a largeish team,  with  Doug  Little 
prominent started to develop a viewing engine for the Doom data modules 
called 'WADs'..  It got quite far with Falcon owners being able to tour 
the  seemingly deserted levels,  but this project seems to have stalled 
at  the  moment..  The latest I hear is that Doug has now obtained  the 
source  code for 'Quake',  but I don't seriously see *that* one running 
on the Falcon without major assistance in the processor department!
Release Date - Sort of around since Mid 1996 (unfinished)
Status - Freeware
Availability - Internet, you also need a 'Doom WAD or similar, which is 
at least 10 meg!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Footnote to the above - Titan/Black Scorpion games..
They  never  seem  to be able to get any games finished,  do  they?   I 
remember  in  the beginning,  there was going to be a games  publishing 
arm,  which  was  going  to feature releases for all  the  major  Atari 
formats  from STFM through to Falcon..  I've seen (and heard)  isolated 
bits and pieces of routines and music,that indicate anything they would 
have produced would be world-beating..  Probably on a par with top line 
commercial  stuff  on  any  other format..  That  fell  through..  More 
recently,  they  were  developing a Jag game,  and we did get to have a 
play  with  a  fairly decent preview version,  but  Atari  didn't  help 
matters there, so once again, a no-show was the sad end result.. 

To be fair, they've come up trumps with the more serious stuff, such as 
Apex/Expose,  and  latterly Nemesis/Videlity..  Any games projects just 
don't seem to have enough time to finish them off..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Running
A more realistic approach to the 'Doom clone market on the Falcon. This 
one  should  be released shortly,  and is the culmination of two  years 
work..  Origin  point was a 96ktro at the Fried Bits 3 event in  spring 
1995..  The first playable demo was released at Symposium a year later, 
and  it  should be enjoying final release this spring..  This  bears  a 
major resemblance to Doom,  with elements of other games mixed in,  and 
is  only  partially textured to keep the speed  decent..  Probably  the  
best presented and most professional of the Doom Clones..  
Release Date - Spring 1997
Status - Shareware, and well worth it!
Availability - Internet/PD scene for preview
Marked at - ***** (!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Towers II
Not quite a straight 'Doom' take-off, but notable as a classy adventure 
game in this category..  Taking elements of the classic Dungeon Master, 
and a decent 3-D engine with lightsourced textures etc, and some *huge* 
levels, you got this game via some American talent, and Mike Goodman..
Release Date - Late '94, early '95
Status - Shareware
Availability- From Goodmans PDL

*Follow up!*
This was developed into a Jaguar game, which is slated for a release by 
Telegames this year!

Other Merlin PDL games.. Merlin PDL supported a few other games here in 
the  UK  apart  from  those  already  mentioned,  such  as  the  Unique 
Developments stuff.. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 UFO (Hollandsoft)
This  early  effort  was  a  two  player  'Space  Duel'  game..  Pretty 
truecolour  graphics  and  a nice soundtrack could  not  disguise  this 
rather  simplistic  game..  It lost a lot if you did not have a  second 
player there as well..
Release Date - 1994
Status - Commercial
Availability - From Merlin for a while, now other boxshifters?
Marked at - **
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ping 2000 (Hollandsoft)
In  an  eerie echo of the 'Double Bobble' saga,  this started  life  as 
'Pong  2000' but did not stay that way at the insistence of  a  nervous 
Merlin..  This  was  'Pong' updated for the Falcon,  and was absolutely 
gorgeous looking and sounding, but was let down by the limited gamplay.
Release Date - 1995
Status - Commercial
Availability - see above

 Killing Impact (Rebel Vision)
This  was  probably the most ambitious release apart  from  the  Unique 
Developments  games  sponsored  by Merlin..  A French  produced  arcade 
adventure  with a huge screen area,  and elements of the classic  games 
Joust and Jetpak in there.. Quite a pretty game with lots to explore..

German oddities..  There were several games that were not affiliated to 
any particular group, here are some of them..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Oxyd Magnum
A  game  which  appeared very early on..  An impressive  overhead  view 
puzzle  game with strong elements of Marble Madness,  but needed a  VGA 
monitor to work with initially. An RGB version was released a bit later 
on..  There were also other versions for the ST and TT, so this was not 
a true Falcon game as such, although the title 'Oxyd Magnum' implied it 
was..
Release Date - Mid 1993
Status - Shareware
Availability - Widely available on the PD circuit..
Marked at - ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 3D Crown of Creation (Rebelsoft)
A winner of any competition for misleading games titles,  as this game, 
which  sounded like it ought to be a fantasy adventure  or  roleplaying 
game,  was  in fact a 3-D space opera with elements of 'Elite' or 'Wing 
Commander'..  The first previews were seen in 1995,  and boasted a very 
high standard of presentation,  if a fairly basic game engine..  We all 
thouht  that  it had gone away,  but stories are reaching us of  a  new 
preview version, and the likelihood is that it will be finished soon!
Release Date - Shortly!
Status - Most likely shareware
Availability - Preview only
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Golden Island
The  second  prize nomination for the most  misleadingly  titled  game, 
after  a  bitter fight with 3D Crown of Creation,  goes to this  game.. 
Now,  Golden  Island,  you  think,  pirates  and  a search  for  buried 
treasure,  well  what  you  get is a giant overhead  viewed  train  set 
simulator..  Okay,  there  is some searching for treasure element built 
into the game, but a train is not commonly used for this sort of thing. 
so it is immediately relegated to the category of 'offbeat'..  It tends 
to show its high level language origins a bit too conspiciously and was 
probably written by someone more used to applications software..
Release Date - Sometime in 1994, I think
Status - Shareware, also as a complete game on one CD ROM collection
Availability - The usual PD route
Marked at - ** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Planet of the Red Eagles
Not  a  lot  know about this one,  apart that it is  an  overhead  view 
tile-based strategy/wargame, and the full game comes on CD-ROM..
Release Date - Sometime in 1995-6
Status - Probably commercial
Availability - Not that widely outside of Germany? Try System Solutions 
or 16/32 PDL?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Zodiax
A  strange  one this,  a self-conscious echo of 'R-Type' with a  German 
teenage psycho laugh echoing through the caverns when your ship crashed 
and burned..  The presentation was not really top notch for a Falcon, a 
lot of the graphics having a distinctly ST'ish look to them..
Release Date- 1994
Status - Shareware
Availability - Demo in the PD, Haha! Haha! Haha!

Martin Steen is the author of some well produced games based on  arcade 
classics,  throughly updated for the Falcon,  but not losing that vital 
spark that made them classics in the first place.. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Pac Them
The first work by him,  saw release as a Truecolour Pacman with classic 
gameplay,  but gorgeous graphics and whizzy sound effects.. Notable for 
being  misunderstood and not shown to best effect by ST Format,  but  a 
rather nice game when it came down to it..
Release Date - Mid 1995
Status - Shareware
Availability - Widely in the PD
Marked at - ***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ganymed
Asteroids  gets  a Martin Steen workover,  in a similar fashion to  Pac 
Them,  only  available  as part of the registration incentives for  Pac 
Them normally
Release Date - About the same time as Pac Them
Status - Something like 'reward-ware' for registering the above?
Availability - Only on registering Pac Them
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Spice
Fortunately  not a game based on the media circus antics of  a  certain 
grossy  overpublicised  female band,  but instead a very  well  crafted 
version of 'Defender' for the nineties on the '030.. His best one yet..
Release Date - Mid 1996
Status - Shareware
Availablity - Limited levels version in the PD
Marked at - ****
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Marcus  Binder  Games..  Another German author who threatens to  topple 
into  the territory of 'Prolific' - Currently working on his opus,  the 
humongous Cosmic/Star Raider game..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q Blue
Overhead maze puzzler meets a GEM interface,  and you are a tank! Hours 
of fun for Tautology fazed puzzle freaks or something..
Release Date - Not sure with this one?
Status - Shareware/Freeware?
Availability - Wide though the PD circuit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Solitar de Luxe
Now  this one is a Falconised interpretation of the coloured  pegs  and 
board  classic..  Handy  if you don't have pegs or a wooden board  with 
holes in it lying around!
Release Date - 1993 I think, quite an early effort
Status - Probably freeware
Availability - Wherever PD is found
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cosmic/Star Raider
Marcus's biggest one yet..  Each new report suggests a constant yanking 
up  of  the number of disks required for the game..  It may yet end  up 
becoming  a CD only title!  - The early preview we've seen is a texture 
mapped  tunnel  shoot-em-up..  The  general game will feature  lots  of 
different levels,  be 3-D,  and have 'space' as its main theme.. One to 
watch out for when it eventually gets there..
Release Date - Not yet, some limited previews
Status - I should think commercial
Availability - To be decided
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
French Fancies.. Here are some of the more interesting game projects to 
emerge from the land of designer teddy bears in demos..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Wotanoid
A  very nice 'Asteroids clone,  filling that gap between 'Stardust' and 
heaven..  The  version going around is either the full game,  or a very 
advanced preview..  Top notch graphics,  some involvement by ex-members 
of  the sadly missed EKO demo crew?  A suitably superb Falcon Asteroids 
game, abeit easier if you turn off the gravity..
Release Date - First seen in mid 1996
Status - Good enough to be commercial/shareware, not sure??
Availability - Through the usual PD sources, online etc
Marked at - ****
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Multi-Briques
A  very  early multiplayer breakout/Arkanoid game for the  Falcon  that 
showed  a lot of promise..  Commercially distributed by Parx  Software, 
and  showing  everything  wrong with such  abominations  as  the  Atari 
version..  Typically  French  presentation,  with  Jarresque music  and 
graphics  that  look  like  they've  come  from  an  expensive  box  of 
chocolates..  Only  comparatively  recently got distribution in the  UK 
through 16/32 PDL..
Release Date - If memory serves me, first seen in late '93!
Status- Commercial, also limited levels demo going for a long time
Availability - (In UK) through 16/32 PDL
Marked at - ****
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sheer Agony
A lavishly digitised graphic adventure game spawned both ST and  Falcon 
versions..  This  one  was made by Logitron Software Described as  very 
nice looking, but with limited locations, and ultimately gameplay..
Release Date - Mid 1996
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32 again, there is even a CD ROM version now
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Operation S.K.U.U.M.
Another  Logitron game,  described loosely as an 'Operation Wolf' clone 
for the Falcon. Not much data as relatively new at this stage, but more 
info from the Spring '97 Atari Shows to follow.. 
Release Date - Spring 1997
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32 PDL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aazohm Krypt
Also  by  Logitron,  these  boys  are getting a  reputation  for  being 
prolific..  Ths time,  Mortal Kombat is tackled on the Falcon, and once 
again,  this game is to get a commercial release shortly..  Expect lots 
of graphical presentation, and hopefully a hint of a game in there too?
Release Date - Spring '97
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32 PDL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blum
I've only seen a description and a screenshot on a web page for  this.. 
Looks like a platform game in the style of 'Willy the Adventurer',  and 
I seem to recall this may be semi-commercial or shareware?
Release Date - ??
Status - Probably shareware
Availability - ??
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tool 8 stuff
Various  games coming forth from this newish software house.  An  early 
version of a Role Player was previewed in Maggie 22, other games are on 
their way, these also likely to be graphical adventures as well..
Release Date - Forthcoming
Status - Shareware at least, may be commercial
Availability - To be decided?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Teknoball
Another  ambitious reworking of the 'Breakout' genre,  more faithful to 
the Arkanoid concept than Multi-Briques,  but offering more options and 
gameplay, with elements of a shootemup too.. Released as shareware with 
limited  levels  demo  widely circulated..  Nice graphics,  and  multi-
channel pounding 'techno' mod soundtracks.. 
Release Date - 95-96
Status- Shareware
Availability - Widely in the PD, but registered to get full version
Marked at - ****
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ultimate Arena
By  a  team called STeam..  This approached the beat-em-up with  decent 
interpretations  for  both the STe and Falcon,  the Falcon having  more 
colours  etc..  After people had stopped boggling at the resemblance to 
Mortal  Kombat,  they  played  it,  and didn't get on too badly by  all 
accounts..
Release Date - Vague, latter part of 1995 for STe version?
Status - Shareware/semi commercial
Availability  -  Single  level  demo  in  the  PD,   not  sure  who  is 
distributing it at this time?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Super Bomber Man
An  interesting interpretation of Dynablasters,  the up to four  player 
Hudson  Soft Console Classic..  This one being Falcon specific,  and by 
someone  called  Archangel..  So  far,  only pre-release  version  seen 
around..
Release Date - Not quite yet?
Status - Probably shareware
Availability - Pre-release circulating
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Czech  connection..  Developments from this almost forgotten corner  of 
Europe have been well received by the rest of the Atari community..  As 
the East European scene becomes more important in demo making, I'm sure 
we'll  here more from there as well when it comes to good games  making 
before too long..
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Watership
Suma,  the  team  also responsible for Gravon (See below) debuted  with 
this little effort of one man and his boat..  Always a good combination 
for games based action,  that is..  It tended to be fussy about monitor 
types on the Falcon as I remember.. 
Release Date - 1994
Status - Freeware or shareware
Availability - Widely seen in the PD
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gravon
Suma's  more important release,  and a genuine 3-D game on the  Falcon, 
which are fairly rare for some reason..  It started life as 'Hover 94', 
a playable demo of a landscape simulator.. The finished game featured a 
hovercraft,  plenty of traditional solid 3-D vector graphics,  and some 
stunningly lovely mist-shaded mountain landscapes.. Oh yes, the enemies 
are a sod to kill as well..  Nearest equivalent on any other machine, a 
souped  up  'Midwinter'  for the Falcon,  but stripped of most  of  the 
strategy element and reduced to a straightforward shoot-em-up..

This  apparently was designed to be upgraded into a Jaguar  game,  with 
several  key routines for the 'Jag already in place in the Falcon  game 
code.. Not sure what happened to that once Atari and JTS became one?
Release Date - 1995
Status - Commercial
Availability - 16/32 in the UK

 Power Up
A  new entry to the Czech Connection with a racing game in an  overhead 
'Super  Sprint'  format..  Not strictly Falcon,  but able to run   with 
enhancements on that machine..  Due for commercial release shortly, and 
already favourably received.. It's one we are looking forward to seeing 
at  the  Spring Atari Shows..   Written by a team called MC  Soft,  and 
distributed in the UK by Floppyshop..
Release Date - Spring '97
Status - Commercial

Demo Crews.. Now apart from the many demos produced for the '030, games 
making  forms an important outlet for their talents as well..  Here are 
some projects not as yet covered elsewhere..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dynablasters
The  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation (TSCC),  quite apart  from  their 
worldbeating  96k  demos,  have also been good enough to give  us  this 
multiplayer bomb-blast of a game.. Not strictly Falcon, as STe as well, 
but pretty good all the same..
Release Date - Been out a couple of years
Status - Shareware
Availability - Wide  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Boom/Incubator
This combination of genres by NPG has been extensively seen in  preview 
versions, and alas, looks like it will stay that way.. You got for your 
disk,  a  mixture  of 2-D traditional shoot-em-up,  a fractal landscape 
flyover,  and some Wolf/Doom dungeon routines.. It was pulled apart and 
completely  re-written  at  one  stage,  but no  recent  news  on  this 
project..  The last time it was seen was at the 1995 Fried Bits, and it 
also seems that NPG have drifted away from active participation on  the 
Falcon in any shape or form, so we must conclude this game is dead..
Release Date - Demo has been around for a couple of years
Status - Unlikely to ever get full release
Availability - Demo in the PD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 X-Moon 
This  lavish shoot-em-up,  in the tradition of 'Wings of Death' et  al, 
has been around in one form or another for at least two years.. A level 
demonstrator was released at Symposium, revealing the fact that several 
people  from different demo crews had been working on it..  Another one 
lacking recent news and with a worse than average chance of release  as 
many of the participants may well have switched platforms by now?
Release Date - Demo version in April 1996
Status - Shareware if full version produced?
Availability - Demo in the PD/Website still running?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Painium Disaster
A  parallel  project to X-Moon above,  but produced by a  single  group 
Cruor, and with an impending final release date about now.. This shoot-
em-up  will most likely have a commercial release,but distributors  for 
the  UK are unknown..  We have seen an earlier demo released a year ago 
and await the final version with great interest..
Release Date - April '97
Status - Shareware/commercial
Availability - Single level demo released at Symposium
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Moonspeeder/Moongames
This game appeared courtsey of Crac of 'Bound' series fame, over a long 
time,  firstly as the 3-D polygon racing game Moonspeeder,  and then as 
the  3-D poly racer with extra twiddly bits,  Moon Games..  This is the 
Falcons  answer  to  the SNES game 'F-Zero',  and worked  quite  well.. 
Initially  distributed by Compo (Compo France as the main HQ) but  went 
to freeware once the company went bankrupt..  Which was jolly decent of 
them!!
Release Date - 1995 onwards
Status - Previously commercial, now freeware
Availability - In the PD, (a bigger than average release!)
Marked at - ****
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vertical Mayhem
An  early  effort  from Griff of former ST demo  scene  fame..  A  well 
executed  'Columns' game to go with his other small utilities  that  he 
wrote for the Falcon,  the early .MOD player, the small demos, the MPEG 
player and so on..  Pity he never did anything really big on the Falcon 
before moving to work for a commercial games developer..
Release Date - An early one, 1993 I think
Status - PD/Shareware
Availability - Widely via the usual PD routes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Neurobotix/Solos
A  relative newcomer to the world of Falcon games,  Pieter van der Meer 
and  his  unpronounceable software label has kicked out  Neurobotix,  a 
platform game based around a homicidal robot,  similar in feel to a lot 
of eight bit games,  but massively enhanced with the sort of things the 
Falcon  is so good at..  This saw shareware release at the end of 1996, 
and  is  slowly building a following..  Current work is on  an  'Elite' 
style game called 'Solos' - More info eagerly awaited..
Release Date - Later part of 1996
Status - Shareware
Availability - Unregistered version widely circulating

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Willy the Adventurer
Not  sure if this is 'demo crew',but never mind..  We first saw this at 
the  beginning  of  1996,   with  the  Swedish  New  Beat  Developments 
attempting  to do their own 'Rayman style game for the Falcon..  A more 
recent  preview  shows a lot of progress being made with  reference  to 
level design and game engine..  The final release should not be too far 
away,  and will be shareware or commercial.. It certainly is commercial 
quality,  and  with  Running,  will make 1997 the best year for  Falcon 
games yet!
Release Date - First seen beginning of 1996
Status - Shareware/commercial
Availability - Level demo in the PD..
Marked at - ***** (!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Men of War
This is a Falcon update of the Atari VCS oldie 'Combat' which takes two 
players and has them blasting away at each other, nothing more, nothing 
less.. Videogaming stripped down to the essentials but with due amounts 
of 32-bit dressing..  This was seen as a demo version at the release of 
the  Diskbusters  diskmag *issue 12),  and is presumably still  working 
towards completion at the hands of Bonus under the 'Fun' label..
Release Date - Soon?
Status - Shareware or PD

Bobbins  Stuff..  Unfortunately,  into  every little rain,  a life must

some that fall firmly into the category of 'Thanks, but no thanks!'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Frantick
One of Dave Munsie's more legendary lapses of concentration.. Sort of a 
cross between Galaxians,  Tempest 2000,  and a lot of knitting patterns 
in  the  background..  This  was  a case where  producing  a  shareware 
grabbing  limited demo crippled the appeal of the game,  as it was  all 
over before you got into it,  and you didn't really want to spend money 
finding out if it was just more of the same.. Not really a Falcon game, 
but  with  certain enhancements to the audio side of it and  a  bit  of 
extra  speed to make it even more unplayable..  Happily,  Dave restored 
his reputation with the much more appealing and playable 'Asteroidia'..
Release Date - Early 1995
Status - Shareware
Availability - Single life demo which is over in a flash.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Black Hole
This emerged at that vunerable early time in the Falcon's life, when it 
was  all  dressed up,  and with nothing to run on it..  Billed as a run 
around and find things game,  no-one really knew what was going on,  as 
the  author  decided  to  dispense  with  all  the  normal  gameplaying 
conventions such as entertainment,  attractive graphics, and a coherent 
plot..  It featured several rather spacious sound samples,  but samples 
do not on their own a game make..
Release Date - 1993
Status - Clinically dead
Availability - No, you don't want to, really you don't!
Marked at - *
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Atari Breakout
This  was  the pack-in game with the Falcon,  and shows Atari at  their 
haphazard worst..  Totally unlovely GEM based interface and graphics, a 
few  clumsily  executed samples,  and this was the best they could  do? 
It is estimated that the proper independent games scene was delayed for 
three  months  whilst the various people who had  bought  Falcons  were 
recovering from their laughing fit on first seeing Atari Breakout..
Release Date - 1992/3
Status - None
Availability - Thankfully forgotten!
Marked at - Less than * 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Break Out by Thomas Haines
This  managed  the  remarkable distinction of being  the  second  worst 
version  of  Breakout,  against  the very tough  competition  from  the 
official Atari effort.. It appeared sometime after the Atari effort, so 
he  should  have had no excuse.  The main game part was even worse,  if 
that  is  possible,  set  against some impressive only on a  very  thin 
superficial  level window dressing..  It was only partially finished to 
be fair,  but there was no attempt by the author at a follow up,  or to 
make a poor job better..
