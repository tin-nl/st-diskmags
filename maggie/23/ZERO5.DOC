
The last days of Caspian Software!!

This  one comes to us courtesy of Jaguar Explorer Online,  or 'JEO' for 
short,   an   undead  version  of  the  old  'Atari  Explorer   Online' 
newsletter..  issue  one contains loads of good text,  quite a bit from 
the Web pages of Jeff Minter,  more interviews, news of forthcoming Jag 
games such as this one,  and Iron Soldier II on CD!! It is well worth a 
read  for  the copious and varied content if you haven't  already  seen 
it..  JEO  gave  the  okay  to re-use articles  such  as   this  rather 
illuminating  interview  text,  on the general principles it  was  non-
profit, and the content was unedited.. 

Well here we go...

Out of all of the games that Telegames is releasing, one really catches 
my   attention...  that's  Zero  5.  From  what  I've  seen,  it  looks 
sensational. Now,  from what I've read, it sounds great as well.

I  want  to thank Mr.  Gosling for being so kind in letting me do  this  
interview.

Note:  There  is some adult language at the bottom of this interview as 
Matthew  gets angry (not at me of course!)

[JEO] First off, who developed Zero 5? What did the team consist of?

[Matthew Gosling] Caspian Software, a tiny development house. In-house, 
there  were just two of us working full-time: 
 * Chris Dillon - MD, producer, head honcho 
 * Matthew Gosling (me!) - programmer

Everyone else on the project was freelance, they were used as they were  
needed, (some a lot more than others): 

 * Dave Pratt - programmer 
 * Dave Newman - music & SFX 
 * James Veal - music & SFX 
 * Mark Bloomfield - graphics & modeling 
 * Sean Baggeley - programmer (tools) (also programmed Caspian's  first 
   game "Rock & Roll Clams" for the ST) 
 * David Philbedge - bitmap graphics 
 * Andrew Gisby - technical support,  supplied various graphics,  sound 
   FX, and  was also the poor sucker who got to do the speech :)   Also 
   programmed the STe/Falcon original version of Zero 5.

[JEO] Can you tell us a bit about the game's story?

[MG]  There are aliens.  You shoot them.  The general storyline is that 
you've  got a load of aliens attacking Earth (mold-breaking concept,  I 
know),  and   Earth  sets  up Defcon (Defense Control),  a  network  of 
defense  craft  around the  Earth.  All the alien activity  comes  from 
sector 0-5,  hence the name.  I think  that's roughly it, I had nothing 
to  do  with  the STe/Falcon version,  and we  chucked  in  a  cut-down 
storyline for the Jag version fairly late in the  project.

[JEO]  There's been a big discussion about whether or not this game  is 
on  rails...  from the vid-clip I saw of the game, it looked close. Can 
you clear  this up?

[MG]  Sort  of.  Basically,  there are 3 completely different styles of 
game  in   there.  Your mothership is called a HitPak,  and it holds  a 
small fighter  called a BamBam (stands for Break-Away Mode).  Sometimes 
you  are in a gun  turret in the HitPak craft,  other times you go into 
break-away mode and  control the BamBam craft.

The three game types are: 
 (1) BamBam Space Dogfight 
 (2) HitPak Gunner Sequence 
 (3) BamBam Trench Sequence
I'll go through the 3 in turn.

(1) BamBam Space Dogfight 

In this mode,  you're flying in outer space - you aren't actually GOING  
anywhere as such, so there is no exploration involved. Aliens attack on 
pre- set patterns (Atari was touting it as a "Virtual Galaxians"  which 
is  a pretty  good definition).  You have complete freedom of  rotation 
with  your ship,  you  can point anywhere you want (flying "out" of the 
screen if you want).

Example:  If  you see a load of aliens to your left,  and you rotate so 
you  are  pointing right at them,  you won't actually fly through them, 
just  closer.  If   you  rotate so you point to the  right,  you  won't 
completely escape from them,  you'll just move a bit further away (they 
are always tracking you, and trying  to keep up with you).

When they shoot at you, they hardly EVER miss, so you have to shoot the  
incoming  fire.  This  is  made  quite easy because when  one  of  your 
"bullets"  collides with an alien bullet, the alien bullet explodes but 
yours keeps  going,  so you can easily take out a whole stream of alien 
bullets with just  one or two of your own.  Collision detection between 
bullets is tweaked  HEAVILY in the player's favor so you don't have  to 
be  perfectly  accurate,  you  just have to shoot in roughly the  right 
direction.

We  went for this style of play because we found that most  3D  polygon 
shooters  (such as Cybermorph) were based on exploration,  and you have 
to sort of  wander round for ages trying to find some action. That sort 
of  game is fine,   but we wanted to do something where all the  action 
comes to you,  a more  intense blast. Basically we wanted to create the 
same sort of frantic  blasting action you had in games like Gradius and 
R-Type, but in 3D.

BTW,  this mode also has an "intelligent" camera,  which moves slightly  
depending  on which way you're pointing,  and zooms in/out depending on 
the  action.  For example, if an alien appears somewhere where it can't 
be seen  (e.g.  "out" of the screen behind the camera), then the camera 
will zoom out  until the alien is visible.  The player can then see the 
alien,  rotate  around  to point "out" of the screen at it and blow  it 
away.

(2) HitPak Gunner Sequence 

In  this mode,  you are in a mothership (a HitPak) which is  constantly 
drifting   forwards  through space,  with aliens attacking  on  pre-set 
paths.  You, the  player, are situated in a gun turret on the underside 
of the ship. Moving the  d-pad will move your sights on the screen, but 
when you reach the far left or  right side of the screen, continuing to 
move in that direction will start to  rotate the gun turret around. The 
angle  of the gun turret can only rotate on  the Y- axis,  but has 360-
degree freedom. In this sense, I think that means it  is "on rails" not 
like  Galaxian 3 (where you just guide a 2D crosshair) but   more  like 
Panzer  Dragoon  where you can rotate your viewpoint  and  shoot  stuff  
that's coming up behind you, etc.

If  you've seen screenshots (up-to-date ones) you'll see that  when  in 
the   HitPak gun turret,  there is like a radar screen on the  console, 
with  2  lines  making a "V" shape.  This shows the player's  field  of 
view,  and  as  you  rotate  the turret,  the "V" on the  scanner  will 
rotate.

When you get onto the harder levels,  this gets a bit like Defender, in 
that  you spend more time watching the scanner than you do watching the 
main  screen.  When a new alien warps into the area,  you hear a sound, 
so the first  thing you tend to do is look at the scanner to see  where 
it is, rotate around  to it and shoot it.

Another thing you should see in the screenshots is that on the scanner, 
there   are  lots  of small lines around the  outside  of  the  scanner 
"screen" on the  console.  These give the shield status for your HitPak 
craft. If a bullet hits  your ship, the part that got hit will have its 
shield  strength  turned down.   If any one of the shields  goes  below 
critical,  it's  game  over.  This means  that you have to monitor your 
shields  closely,  so for example,  if the shields  along the left-hand 
side of the ship are weakest, then you need to defend  that side of the 
ship  more,  even if it means taking a bit of damage on the  right-hand 
side.

As in BamBam mode, you shoot incoming fire from aliens.

(3) BamBam Trench Sequence 

This  mode  crops up three times during the game,  and is a bit like  a 
cross   between  Tempest  2000 and the bonus stage  on  Sonic  2!  It's 
completely  on   rails,  a texture-mapped trench/tunnel flies  at  you, 
(you're  supposed to be  strafing along the top of a huge mothership  - 
this  is straight out of Star  Wars) and you use left/right  to  rotate 
around  the  walls.  There  are  some walls  which you  have  to  shoot 
through,  some  are invincible and must be dodged  around (you can tell 
these because of how they look,  and the metal "clang"  noise they make 
when one of your bullets hits them).  Somewhere in the trench  you will 
come  across  the  reactor  core which you must  blow  up  quickly,  as  
colliding  with it = instant death (no matter how much shield  strength 
you  have).

This  section is put in as a bit of eye candy,  and to give the  player  
something a bit different, which is why we didn't use it too much.

[JEO] Is this game single- or two-player?

[MG] One only. We originally planned to put in a 2-player mode but time  
didn't allow.

[JEO] Is the ProController supported?

[MG] We were going to, but it became obvious that the Jag was dying, we  
didn't  think there was any WAY that the 6-button pad would  ever  come 
out, and  we just didn't have time for it.

[JEO] Can you select different ships?

[MG] No, that's all fixed.

[JEO] Can you tell us something about the different weapons?

[MG] In BamBam mode,  killing a complete wave of aliens without missing 
any   gives a powerup globe.  You have to point towards it to fly  into 
it.  The   player  can choose whether they want to take it as a  weapon 
powerup,  a shield  powerup, or a score bonus. Powering up your weapons 
makes  your bullets start  to get faster and do more damage,  then they 
start  to  get bigger,  and  eventually you get to fire four  shots  of 
super-powered bullets (instead of  two shots of weak small bullets).

You  also have three smart-lazers.  This is like a smart-bomb,  and you 
are  invincible when you activate it. It makes a blue stream of bullets 
(a  bit   like  a  bolt  of  lighting)  fly  out  from  your  ship  and 
automatically lock on to  all the enemies that are active. Its power is 
spread amongst the aliens, so  using it when there are eight aliens out 
there  will  do less damage per alien  than if there was only  one  out 
there.  It automatically destroys all alien  bullets (without absorbing 
any  of its power) as well.  We usually put in at  least one  virtually 
impossible wave in the levels somewhere which is your cue  to make  use 
of your smart-lazer.

There  are no powerups or smart-lazers in HitPak mode.  In Trench mode, 
it's  like the BamBam dogfight with the exception that you get no smart 
lazers,  and   you  can't  power up to the stage where  you  fire  four 
bullets per shot.

[JEO] How many enemies are there? Levels?

[MG]  There  are  15 missions.  Some will be in only one of  the  three 
modes,   others  combine several of them.  When you complete a mission, 
the next mission  is "unlocked" (if your cartridge EEPROM works),  same 
system as in Doom.

[JEO] Are there selectable views?

[MG] No,  there is intelligent camera zooming in BamBam mode,  and also 
there  are link animations between levels (can't do FMV off a cart!).

[JEO]  I've heard that the game has a driving soundtrack.  What kind of 
tunes  does the game have, and how big is the selection of tunes?

[MG] There are four tunes, one for the title screen, three in the game. 
The   music  is  sorta techno-ish.  It's not quite the  same  style  as 
Tempest 2000, but  it's similar.

The  sound  driver is 8-channel - that's 4 channel music  +  4  channel 
sound  FX.   There  is also real-time audio filtering;  the user has  a 
slider control for  bass/treble.

[JEO] How big is the game?

[MG] It's a 2 megabyte cart. I think I read somewhere that it is 4 meg, 
but  that might just be Telegames trying to justify the $60 price tag.

[JEO] What resolution does the game run in. What color depth?

[MG] 256 colors. Most of the polygons are flat-shaded, so running in 8-
bit  color gives a blitting speed around twice as fast as 16-bit.

[JEO] Can you tell us how fast the frame rate is?

[MG] It's usually around 30 FPS.  The display is triple buffered, so it 
can   simulate any frame rate - if we're running just below 30  FPS  we 
don't have to  drop to 20, it can do 29.

The  frame  rate is limited to a maximum of 30 FPS on  NTSC,  otherwise 
slowdown  would be too noticeable.  On the PAL version,  we allow it to 
run  at 50FPS but  not for two consecutive frames,  so the max limit is 
around  35  FPS  on PAL.  It  needs this,  as the engine stretches  all 
polygons vertically to keep the  aspect ratio the same as NTSC,  and 25 
FPS is just slightly too jerky.

The  polygon  performance  is around 20,000 per second  if  I  remember 
correctly.   That's  when it's around 10% textured,  and with 8-channel 
sound over the top  (this affects performance).  We used a very fast Z-
sorting  algorithm.  We found  that Z-buffering is really really  slow; 
although  Atari  said  Z-buffering was  the fastest way  of  doing  it, 
unfortunately that's complete crap.  Z-sorting  does mean there's a few 
polygon glitches, but at least it's not running at 5  FPS =).

[JEO] Are there any special effects in the game?  i.e.  light sourcing,  
animated textures, etc.

[MG]  There is no lightsourcing.  Some people thought there was gouraud  
shading,  but this is not even possible in 256 colors, the effect comes 
from  the high polygon count in BamBam mode,  with subtle color changes 
between  polygons.

[JEO] How did you pull off those explosions?  How were they made?  They 
seem to  be somewhat pixelshatter.

[MG]  The Blitter can scale a bitmap out by spreading out the pixels  - 
it's   quite a straightforward thing for the Blitter to do,  I actually 
had  the idea  before I saw T2K,  then I was really pissed off that  it 
had already been done!

The main reasons why we used particle explosions were:

(1) Speed. It doesn't matter how big or small you scale the bitmap, the 
speed   is only affected by the size of the source image (in  our  case 
32x32 pixels),  so you can spread the pixels out really wide for a huge 
explosion without  slowing down.

(2)  Gameplay.  Because of the way that the camera can sort of zoom out 
(when   in  BamBam mode) when your ship is surrounded by  aliens,  what 
often happens is  that you shoot "out" of the screen at aliens that lie 
between  your  ship and  the camera.  If we put a huge solid  explosion 
there  when  you  took out one of  these aliens,  it  would  completely 
obstruct the screen and you wouldn't be  able to see what the hell  you 
were doing. So basically it allows you to still  see what you're doing, 
as you can see through the explosions.

In  T2K,  it  scaled  up static images (like the "2000" thing  and  the 
"Excellent"   text),  but what I did was to scale up an animated image. 
The explosions use  something like 20 frames of animation,  so you have 
an animated explosion  being particle-exploded at the same time. It's a 
nice effect.

In BamBam mode,  when you take out an alien, it actually triggers about 
4  or  5   particle  explosions  on the  same  spot,  but  with  slight 
differences  in  the   scaling speed,  so each pixel in  the  explosion 
appears  to  have a "trail" of  about 4 other pixels.  (Wes  says  that 
sounds awesome)

[JEO] What kinds of improvements were made over the Falcon game?

[MG]  It's a completely different game!  It shares the title,  parts of 
the   storyline,  and  a few graphics (such as the 8x8 font!),  but  in 
general  it's  a   different game.  I wasn't even allowed  to  see  the 
STe/Falcon version when I  first started at Caspian,  in case I got the 
wrong idea about what was wanted  for the Jag version!

[JEO] How much time was spent on the project?

[MG]  It started towards the end of January '95.  We delivered the beta 
to  Atari towards the end of February '96.  We then spent about a month 
waiting to  be paid for the beta,  fixing a few small bugs,  and trying 
to  tie up a  publishing deal with a giant publisher (I can't say  who) 
for  a Playstation  version of Zero 5.  This deal fell through  because 
the  publisher  was  already  handling too many  projects  -  we  could 
probably  have  done it if we'd waited  for a few months,  but  Caspian 
just couldn't afford to stay afloat for that  long.

[JEO]  How difficult is it to program a Jaguar game?  Compared to other  
systems?

[MG] It's really nice.  I came from an Amiga demo coding background, so 
I  went  straight from Amiga to Jaguar and I was just completely  blown 
away  by the  hardware.  It's just like an Amiga that's miles better at 
EVERYTHING.  The  only  thing that caused headaches for me was the  GPU 
bug  that stops it from running  out of main RAM,  so you have to  keep 
splitting  code  into  4K segments - that  is a  real  pain,  but  it's 
necessary if you want your code to perform well.

[JEO] What's this I'm hearing about you guys not getting paid for  this 
game?  Did you guys get paid salaries for working there?


[MG]  All  the  people involved in the project  were  paid  by  Caspian 
software,  we  all got our salaries.  When I say we didn't get paid,  I 
mean  that Caspian  software was not paid money owed by Atari  for  the 
development.

There  was  a milestone due when Atari received the beta  version,  and 
they   didn't  pay it.  All of a sudden,  they decided that they didn't 
like  aspects  of  the game that had been in there since day  one,  and 
unless we completely  change everything they won't accept it as a  beta 
version.  They kept us  hanging on for a month,  coming back to us with 
utterly  ridiculous  "bugs"   (there was a very very  small  number  of 
genuine bugs,  but most of them were  just Atari being stupid),  and in 
the end, the company couldn't carry on, and  was "put to sleep".

I was laid off, and both me and Chris got new jobs.

A  couple  of months ago,  however,  I got internet access at work,  and 
nearly   had a heart attack when I saw people on  rec.games.video.atari 
talking  about   Zero 5 being published by Telegames.  We thought  that 
someone  must have just  spread some bullsh*t rumor,  but the Telegames 
website  suggested otherwise.  We  had absolutely NO idea that this had 
happened,  we were not consulted at all,   and we are still not getting 
paid for it (Caspian still exists, it never went  into receivership).

Atari still maintains that it was not a beta,  and sold it to Telegames 
on  the  understanding that it was an unfinished product.  This doesn't 
stop  Atari  from   getting  a royalty  on  sales  of  the  "unfinished 
product",  but  that royalty is  so embarrassingly low that if  they're 
that  f*cking  desperate  then they're  welcome to it  as  far  as  I'm 
concerned.

There are legal reasons (that I can't go into) as to why Caspian is not 
suing  the ass off Atari/Telegames.

Hopefully  you can see why the tone of my Usenet post came across as  a 
bit  angry, you have to understand that I spent a year working flat out 
(the  latter half of which was working around 12 hours a day,  6-7 days 
a week) on a  game that never came out, and that is now being published 
and  cashed  in  on  without any of the people  who  created  it  being 
consulted in any way. It's  Atari that are the scum here, I don't think 
that  Telegames  knew the  situation,  they just bought the rights  off 
Atari.

The  money doesn't really bother me,  it's the principle - but hey  who 
gives a  sh*t, I got my break into the games industry, Atari is welcome 
to their $1.50  per cart (oops...).
