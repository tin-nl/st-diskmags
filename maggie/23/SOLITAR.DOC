                             A game for Falcon 030
                          programmed by Markus Binder.



     Okay, so who HASN'T heard of Solitaire??   (er.. is Joanna in it? - Felice)
Well for the benefit of  the  culturally  handicapped  here follows a brief Blue
Peter style make-your-own Solitaire (professionals may wish to skip this bit):

     Take one round, wooden board  (i.e.,  a  breadboard), drill it with several
large holes, (how to sneak off with  dad's  power  drill will be explained in an
ensuing article) empty your piggy bank of  its  œ1.86  worth of two pees and run
down to the corner shop to  buy  a  quarter  of Dobson's Direct Rubard & Custard
Creams.  Eat half of them on  the  way  home  then  use the rest to populate the
holes you have embellished the surface of the breadboard with.  Now, leaving one
empty hole in the middle of the board,  start the game by jumping one sweet over
another, into the empty space (the sweet you have jumped over can now be eaten).
Continue to do this until:
     A): you have eaten all the sweets you can
     B): you have got bored and eaten all the sweets anyway
     C): you have completed the game -  that  is, you have one [solitary - hence
the name? - ] sweet left in  the  centre  of  the board.. hurray!  You have just
completed your first game of Solitaire..  of  course  if  you want to play again
you'll have to save up  your  pocket  money  to  buy  some more Rubard & Custard
Creams, or maybe some Kola Kubes  (um..  would  that  work? -ed)  BUT WAIT!  YOU
COULD get hold of a copy  of  SOLITAR  DE  LUXE,  by Markus Binder... a game for
Falcon 030!

     Solitar De Luxe is a GEM  game  and  therefore  must be booted in the right
resolution from the desktop (640x480, 256 colour).   And as with many Gem games,
the speed is akin to a  PC screen saver (i.e. sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow)
but because it is a puzzle game, speed  is  not  really as high a priority as it
would be with, say, an action  packed  platformer,  so it is actually NOT really
detrimental to its playability.

     Once loaded, an intro picture is  displayed showing a nice, rendered marble
sphere, being bisected by and partially  reflected  onto a flat, marble surface.
Over this picture is a stylized, one  colour 'Solitar De Luxe' logo that screams
"Breakout Land here we come!", as  well  as  another  piece of text informing us
that this game was 'programmiert 1993 von Markus Binder'.  It serves to warn the
inexperienced user that  an  impending  info  screen  will  all  be conducted in
Deutsch.  And it is.

     After  throwing  away  your  'Collins   Traveller   German  Phrase  book  &
dictionary' because the only word  it  recognised  seemed to be 'Sausage salad',
you give up and plunge straight  into  the  thick  of the game.  The info screen
disappears, in such a way  as  should  be  accompanied  with  a loud bang, and a
light-sourced, wood-textured,  circular  solitaire  breadboard  appears.   It is
enigmatically empty.  Now, having previously perused  the text files, not all of
which were in German, you are armed with the knowledge that for some reason, the
key 'a' should start the game.  You  tentatively  give it a try and are rewarded
with the arrival of  several  marbled  marbles,  one  for  each hole (the holes,
incidentally, look more like bumps..  it's  probably  a government conspiracy in
conjunction with XT Life Forms).  The board is filled.. let the game commence!

     To jump the marbles around the board, left mouse button is used to select a
ball and if there is only one  place  it  can  go to it will jump automatically,
otherwise, right mouse button  selects  its  destination.   As  easy  as an easy
chair, as simple as Simon.

     Now some cynics out there may have already relegated this game to the seen-
it-all-before-DONE-it-all-before  pile,  but  WAIT   one  tantalizing  minute...
Solitar De Luxe, is not called 'De Luxe' for nothing.  No indeed.  This game has
a special function.   Once  you  have  finished  your  game,  whether with great
victory, or crushing defeat, you  have  the  option  to  go  back, step by step,
looking at all the moves you  made..  YES!   Action  replay for Solitaire at the
touch of two buttons ('+' and  '-').   BUT  WAIT!!  That's not all. ("That's not
all?!" I hear you cry incredulously.)   There  is  also  an option to save  your
finished game (eh?! -Ed), so that you  can  load  it up and impress your friends
with your Solitaire strategy.  I'm sure  Solitaire Evenings will soon become the
pivot of high society; forget slide shows, forget Kodak Photo CDs, forget CD 32s
(we already have -Ed).. solitaire  action  replay  AND save will provide, simply
HOURS of entertainment.

[this part has been  blatantly  robbed  from  the  late  ST  Format, but I don't
suppose Nick Peers  will  be  allowed  time  off  from  his  new  job  at Future
Publishing's 'Knitting Weekly' to stop us..]
