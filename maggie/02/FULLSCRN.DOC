     Could this pair of guys be the only demo coders in Portugal?   
Well we certainly haven't heard of any others apart from them. 
This short story begins about 1 year ago. We received a demo from
TEX called the Spectrum Slideshow. It was coded by Mr. Simoes and
it was really very clever. Now after a long period of silence he
has returned, this time accompanied by a friend, with the full
screen demo. I think this has got to be the first ever demo to 
consist entirely of fullscreens.
     There are eight of them in all and some are really quite 
impressive, and so we shall start at the beginning:-

     The loader screen consists of a large disting logo with a 
split palette running vertically down the screen in the middle.
     The menu is once more a fullscreen and features a horizontal 
starfield with some very colorful scrollines running across the 
full width of the screen. Various effects are used on these 
scrolls, including byte bending etc. Some graphics in the lower 
border tell you that the keys F1-F6 give you yet more screens.
     
     The first screen has an absolutely enormous 'sprite' of the 
globe moveing in a sort of sine waveform over the fullscreen. The 
globe must be 200*200 so it relly is pretty clever!!
     The second screen is nice and colorful and features a 100's 
of atri signs all over the screen slowly wobbling back and forth 
with a large logo disting back and forth across the top of the 
screen.
     The third screen is a mega parallax with lots of layers of 
xenon graphix moving at different speeds across the screen, back 
and forth, bak and forth it really quite mesmerizing........
     The fourth screen is a Starray type parallax with some very 
nice 3D type bobs moving around in and out and a flipping ( as in 
turning over!!) sign bouncing up and down.
     The fifth screen apparently uses the Sync scrolling 
technique to achieve to layers of fullscreen parallax, one of 
graphix and one of color, moveing left to right and a big logo 
bouncing up and down over the top of them. Quite nice.
     The Sixth screen is a full screen spectrum picture with some 
very small volume indicators located at the edges.

     Overall this demo is a nice one. The only problem is that 
the screens are a little bit repetitive and they don't hold the 
interest for very long. None of the screens contain a scrolline 
except for the main menu (some people would say this was a good 
thing!) and thus after you have looked at the demo for a little 
while there isn't really that much to make you go back and look 
at it again. 
     None of the fullscreens are as good as others that I have 
seen by other crews/people but having said that this is not by 
any means a bad demo and is in my opinion worth adding to your 
collection.
     Nice one Paulo, if you ever get bored drop me a line again 
sometime as I have lost your address.
