Hi there, this is going to be a very short preview has there is 
not  going to be another issue !!  Got you there,  just  kidding. 
With what I said,  I meant that there will be no issue after this 
one  for 2 months.  The next ISSUE WILL BE RELEASED SOME TIME  IN 
SEPTEMBER. The reason why it is so far away is that I (Sammy Joe) 
am  the only Lost BOY here in London for 2 1/2 months and I  will 
not  be  here for one month myself,  so basically that's  why  we 
haven't got the time to do one !!!! Sorry guys. 

As you have probably already realized, this issue is twice as big 
as the first one and that is only because we had quite some  feed 
back in the end !!!  Bu to make the 3rd issue even better we need 
your help and support so keep the articles coming !!!!!

The next issue will definitely contain the asm source from one of 
the screens from the Mindbomb demo. 
There  will  also  be an article from a 2  weeks  Copy  Party  in 
Marseille hosted by Next. 
The intro will be coded by ???? (we do not know yet!!!!). We will 
also  have many more tunes on the disk along with best  pictures, 
so please send us your graphix!!!!    

I think that you are getting the idea now,  so please keep up the 
good work and send us lodsa things.

                               THANKS A LOT,

                                             SAMMY JOE OF TLB

P.S.:  THIS MAGAZINE WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE HELP  FROM 
ALL OUR FRIENDS !!!!!!
