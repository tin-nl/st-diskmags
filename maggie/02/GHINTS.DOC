SDI

Here we go again,  the 1st cheat will allow you to access any  of 
the  levels  by pressing the according function  keys.  The  only 
thing you have to do is shoot the swirling pods on the  highscore 
tabel and then enter ALERIC.  If you want to advance to the  next 
level, simply press F. That was not too hard or was it ?


X-OUT

Short of money ?  Just buy a ship and shield it down and get  rid 
of  it straight away.  You  will then be awarded with  500  bonus 
points.


DOUBLE DRAGON

Here's  some stuff that you can type in on the  highscore  table, 
have a guess what it will do ?
     LEVEL ONE PLEASE
     LEVEL TWO PLEASE
     LEVEL THREE PLEASE
     LEVEL FOUR PLEASE
     LAST LEVEL PLEASE
     I DO NOT EANT TO DIE
     GIVE ME MORE HEALTH PLEASE
     GIVE ME LOADS OF TIME PLEASE


RICK DANGEROUS

I am not sure whether or not we had this cheat in the last  issue 
already, here it is... First of all you must finish the 1st level 
and then enter POOKY in the highscore table.  You will no be able 
to  continue from the furthest level that you have reached  while 
playing.


CYBERNOID

Type in RAISTLINON or RAISTLIN (I am not sure what it was ?) when 
you  can  see the title screen and you will now be able  to  move 
around the levels.


5,4,3,2,1,0,-1.... (THUNDERBIRDS)

If you can't get to level 2, type in RECOVERY, for level three it 
is  ALOYSIUS and of course for the last level it is ANDERSON (  I 
wonder why they chose that name ?).


RETURN OF THE JEDI

As  we had the cheat for empire strikes back in the  last  issue, 
here we bring you the one for return of the jedi.  Simply get  on 
the  high score table and type in DARTH VADER.  You will  now  be 
able to skip a level by pressing the F2 key.


FORGOTTEN WORLDS

Depress the shift key while you type in ARC.  You must then press 
the  help key in order to start the game !!  You can  now  choose 
from 2 extra options,  by pressing N you will advance to the next 
level and by pressing S you will go to the shop!!


F16 FALCON

Pissed  off  cause you are always loosing your  merits  when  you 
crash  or  you are shot down ?  Here's the answer  to  your  ever 
lasting fame. When you were hit, press the ESC key and then click 
on the menu entry END MISSION, this way you will not loose any of 
your points.  Are you running out of ammunition ? Press Control X 
and you will be armed with 4000 rounds and 8 sidewinders  ?  Now, 
blow the hell out of your enemy migs !!!


GIGANOID 

When  you  have to select a player press the Capslock key  and  a 
message  will appear on the screen.  You should now  have  enough 
lives.


LED STORM

No comment, just type in: DAVID BROADHURTS WANTS TO CHEAT.


GEMINI WING

Here are the passwords for levels 5 to 7 for the  excellent,  but 
very hard,  shoot-em-up.   I am not giving you the others because 
you would loose some of the game play then. Sorry.
          LEVEL 5 - GUNSHOTS
          LEVEL 6 - DOODGUYZ
          LEVEL 7 - D.GIBSON


DRAGONSCAPE

Start the game by inserting it in your drive.... While playing it 
simply  press  TAB  and enter 2 and you will  be  transported  to 
TECHNOCITY.  Do the same thing again and you will be  transported 
to Iceland.

 
That's it for now with the cheats,  please send me more as I only 
received one letter with 4 cheats in it. Thanks.
