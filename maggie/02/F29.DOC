               F29 Retaliator - A review  
              ---------------------------

WARNING!! 

This is not quite a conventional magazine-
type review giving any frilly  bits  such as  percentage  ratings, 
long-term  thrill-rated pictorial curves  (pardon??)  flow-charts, 
bar-graphs and especially not pictures of assorted prats (Yes, You 
people  responsible  for ZZAP 64/Amiga  magazine!!)  whose  facial 
contortions divulge their keenness, or not, for a particular game. 
(By the way if I come across a bad `un, I have been told I look as 
"pleased" as if the cat drops a large smelly number on the kitchen 
floor overnight for me to clean up in the morning...)

Anyway,  enuff of this,  on to the subject in hand..  THE SCENE,,a 
backstreet in Northampton,  the nation`s favourite ONE HORSE TOWN. 
THE   DATE,   about  mid-June,   I-don`t-know  what-date-it-was-a-
Thursday-don`t-hassle-me-with-numbers-man.   THE   PEOPLE,,myself, 
fellow  `reviewers  Stuart B.  (How much to keep your name out  of 
here???)  and  John  B.  ALSO  one  ST  and  John`s  copy  of  F29 
Retaliator, and this is what roughly happened..

Stuart had the first go,  and took off from the USAF test range in 
Arizona  (harmless)  where  the  only person  he  could  hurt  was 
himself.  In flight-Sim terms, Stuart and I are the kind of people 
who fracture a leg whilst cutting out folded-paper patterns. First 
Stu  had to negotiate the start-up screen ENROLMENT into the  USAF 
which  is peasy,  no horrid waiting six months to get near a plane 
and getting up at five in the morning whilst a nasty man wearing a 
`Smokey  the  bear`  type hat yells at  you  business,  instead  a 
computer  I.D  picture of an idealised fighter-pilot,  Rugged  and 
prematurely balding (he works long hours,  and has wife, kids, and 
mortgage  repayments  to think of.) glowers back at you  from  the 
screen.

This  done the actual plane starts up very much like  falcon  (You 
will hear more in this vein guys and gals...) takes off ok and off 
you go, you have a number off missions to do in all the scenarios, 
but in the USAF range, the targets are all dummies, and the `Migs` 
on  this  occasion are non-lethal drones.  Stu opted for a bit  of 
train-busting  and  set off to singlehandedly  cancel  the  entire 
Network  Southeast  services for the day.  Down came the F22  (for 
that was what we chose,  The supposed Advanced tactical Fighter to 
replace  the good ol` F15`s,  F16`s etc) found a very nicely drawn 
railway  line  with embankments and cuttings and spotted  a  train 
plodding  along...  Well  what do you do,  yes chuck a maverick or 
two!!  Some reasonably priced explosions later the train grinds to 
a halt in a heap of computer-simulated twisted metal,  the problems 
only really start when Stu goes in for a closer look as he  wishes 
to  strafe  any RAILWAY CHILDREN in the vicinity,  he  then  spots 
someone he met in 1987 in the third (undamaged) carriage down  the 
train,  tries  to do a three-point turn to strafe them,  and loses 
the  `missing  the ground for as long as possible` aspect  of  the 
mission.

Some of the above may not be 100% accurate, but it is the best way 
to explain otherwise irrational and  stupid conduct....

John  has  a go now,  he submits to the same  prematurely  balding 
registration  and enrolment procedure,  but this time we goto  the 
USAF Solomons Isles base for the South Pacific campaign (I`m gonna 
wash that MIG right out of my hair..). John is actually quite good 
at this sort of thing,  having played Falcon, F16, Bomber etc, and 
he  rates F16 for realism,  and his mission is to deal with  three 
MIG29`s.  For John this is just a simple matter of picking them up 
on his long-range radar and banging-off several AMRAAM`s in  their 
direction.  After  not too much trouble,  all three expire and the 
mission is completed.  Coming back into land there are a number of 
points to note,  graphically speaking. There are real live clouds, 
or  solid  vector representations,  which cast a shadow,  and move 
about,  the cockpit and Head-Up displays are very pretty indeed, I 
liked  the  Multi-mode rader and Moving-Map  displays,  these  are 
superior to Falcon,  A slight minus is the way in which some large 
vector  drawn  objects  don`t  quite  appear  quickly  enough.  To 
illustrate, we came in to land, on the map display was the island, 
whilst  out  of the window was a very long aircraft  carrier,  aha 
here comes the island. I always thought it would be `Island first, 
runway later` but this is not the case.

After  that it went rapidly downhill from there,  We got shot down 
by a shipboard SAM system, went back to Arizona where I discovered 
how  easy  it was to do High-G turns and black-out (and  also  the 
very useful ability to push the stick back where it came from  and 
regain  control WHILST STILL BLACKED OUT!!!) I also discovered  if 
you have an autofire capable joystick and unlimited munitions, how 
well  your  home  airfield  explodes (from end  to  end  and  very 
impressive it is too..) At least I THINK it was my home base as  I 
crashed to avoid finding out.....

Other  Scenarios  include the Middle East (You  defend  a  country 
which  is NOT Israel against NOT QUITE Syria and other  ARABITES). 
For the hardened military air-crash freak there is a European  WW3 
scenario.  (Just  how  does  that work these days??  You are on  a 
mission  to bomb open parts of the Berlin Wall at the  request  of 
the E.German (OOoops we`re out of a job guys) govt???!!!???)

THE SERIOUS SUMMING UP BIT....

Generally  and  after a very long wait (This was  anticipated  and 
`reviewed`  for Xmas `89)  I am a bit disappointed in what I saw. 
There  are no serious flaws inherent in the game structure or  any 
problems  with  the  graphics,  and the non-vector  parts  of  the 
graphics  are of a very high standard.  The fundamental problem is 
that  F29  is no great advance over Falcon in my  view,  and  this 
problem has been brought into sharp relief by the very long  delay 
for  this  product,  and more especially by the massive  attendant 
hype  by  Ocean which has the result of leaving a less  than  100% 
product  in  the  lurch.  Having  said that,  if you are  an  avid 
collector of military flight-sims or otherwise interested,  F29 is 
very  reasonable  indeed and can be recommended.  I am  personally 
waiting  for Microprose and the ST version of F19 Stealth  Fighter 
for  the next major advances programming and content-wise  on  the 
ST for this format.

Television,  coffee  and sticky coconut cake for what was a  major 
laugh-riot  of  an evening..Also thanks for the raw  material  for 
this  "review"  and I hope I can come back safely after  you  have 
read this little lot!!!!!!

This  flight simulator will surely knock Falcon from  the  number 
one flight sim spot,  as the graphics and playability of F-29  is 
unbeatable.    While loading,  you are presented with a number of 
excellent pictures.    After having logged yourself into the  Air 
Force  computer,you are asked to choose where you would  like  to 
fly.    Here  you  can choose the American  desert,  the  Pacific 
Ocean, the Middle East or Europe.   You are then presented with a 
menu,  which lets you load a previous pilot's log from  disk,  or 
log  in  again,  after this menu you are presented  with  another 
menu,  which lets you chose the mission you require,  ammunition, 
plane  and starting base.   After you have accepting the  mission 
you  are again presented with some more excellent  pictures,  and 
then  you  are  placed in the cockpit of  your  chosen  aircraft.   
Build  up  your  revs,  let the brakes go and pull  back  on  the 
joystick, and you must not forget to retract the undercarriage if 
you wish to land the aircraft again!!!



Missions include hitting canvas targets on the test range in  the 
American desert,  engaging and destroying enemy MiGs,  destroying 
encroaching amphibious tanks,  destroying radar tracking stations 
and industrial works, destroying enemy tanks, airfields, aircraft 
carriers,  bridges,  and the big one is to provide air support to 
your  aircraft carrier,  which is to meet with an enemy  carrier.  
If you complete a number of missions,  you are promoted,  given a 
medal  and a whole set of new mission to  complete,  but  beware, 
when your rank increases,  so does the skill of the enemy!!   All 
in  all there are a massive 95 missions to choose from,  but  you 
will  have  to fly very well to qualify for some  of  the  harder 
mission.


This  flight simulator is the best around at the moment  and  the 
only  downfall of the game is that it is a little hard,  but  the 
mission can be completed, and if I can complete them, then anyone 
can!!

Enjoy this game, I did.
