              shelves product!!!!!!!
              ---------------------- Chris Holland (c) 1990

As  you have now come to expect there is a little cautionary  tale 
that  is  nothing  to do with the game  as  such..  Last  Saturday 
(23/06/90)  I  strolled into my local computer  shop,  spotted  an 
unfamiliar box in amongst all the well-established favourites, and 
had  them load it up on the ST hooked-up to their 26inch very  big 
screen. This was my first look at DAMOCLES which I decided to take 
home with me.  I paid in cash (œ24.99) my entire liquid assets, as 
my poor old credit card had taken a severe beating at the Atari 90 
show,  and  was lying at home quietly whimpering to itself. I then 
proceeded  to  the MIDLAND BANK which accepts  GNATWEST  cashpoint 
cards  and  has many,  many machines in easy reach.  NOT THIS TIME 
though as their machines were not talking to my bank at this time, 
and I had to go to the GNATWEST where a seething surge of humanity 
was  waiting after also NOT getting satisfaction at MIDLAND  BANK. 
It would appear that the till at the computer shop tossed a  virus 
or  logic-bomb  into  the bank computers  upon  detecting  a  CASH 
payment.  Thats  my  theory (Cashtills are  malign  intelligences) 
anyway....

On to the game itself (at last!),  as you are aware,  Damocles was 
announced  at the `87 PCW show as `coming soon`,  after  extensive 
`exclusive  previews`  I was convinced that this was  an  industry 
private  joke made at the expense of us users/purchasers.  We  now 
finally  have  a  finished product nearly three  years  later,  an 
industry record (for now..) so what is it actually like...

Damocles  is on a single disk and is memory resident when  loaded, 
no  disc  swapping,  and you can remove it when loaded,  whilst it 
boots up,  there is a piccy of the Damocles logo-thingy,  which is 
nothing   too  special.   once  loaded  there  is  a  two   minute 
introductory sequence,  similar to Mercenary, where you are brought 
in  to land at capital City spaceport on the planet Eris.  You are 
given  a running `mission brief` whilst you find your car to  take 
you  to  the presidential state office.  The first thing  to  note 
about  the graphics is the sheer speed (when going fast),  you can 
accelerate from 0 mph to "Whatthefuckwasthat" sort of speeds,  and 
this is true of spaceships, flying-craft etc. The look and feel is 
slightly dated in my view, angular solid vectors against (on Eris) 
a  harsh  green  surface,  but  remember,  this  is  only  a  tiny 
percentage  of the total playing area.  In this case it looks like 
Mercenary with solid vectors instead of wireframe.

Some  of  the buildings are very complex  combinations  of  shapes 
indeed,  and there is a network of roads to follow,  (from up high 
you  can  see the layout of the cities in  their  entirety),  also 
trees,  lamposts,  and on `Birmingham island on the planet Dion, I 
came  across street signs,  a satirical reference to Novagens home 
city.  Other nice touches include the ability to splashdown in the 
sea  where you bob up and down on the swell.  (all of this  barely 
scratches the surface of this game..)

As  you  might  expect,  you can gain access to the  buildings  and 
explore  inside  them,  most are empty,  or contain objects of  no 
immediate  use,  however,  some  may well be vital and you have  a 
whole solar systems worth to explore!!  There are lifts so you can 
gain  access  where  there  is  more  than  one  floor  to  visit. 
Internally the building resemble Freescape type constructions, But 
without the multiple viewing angles,  however, objects are in easy 
reach and not hidden.

To return to the mission, you drive to the state office, where you 
are briefed by an absentee president (who has left the planet, not 
surprising as a bloody great comet,  DAMOCLES, is only three hours 
and   something   minutes  away  from  hitting  it!!)   You   were 
apparently  supposed  to have got here with more  time  to  spare 
(some  months  ago!!)  You now have three  hours  left,  which  is 
counting  down on a timer placed very prominently on your  control 
panel.  Upon  accepting  the  mission  you are told to  go  to  an 
absentee professors laboratory,  somewhere else on the planet, for 
further clues.  The prof is in the middle of building a very large 
bomb,  to  be  placed  on the surface of the  comet  and  remotely 
detonated,  but  has had a severe disagreement with the  President 
(called  MAGGIE!!!!)  and has cleared off leaving the  project  in 
midair.  From  there  you  pick up more clues and  progress  to  a 
solution.

Novagen  point  out that this is only one solution  possible,  and 
only  takes in about 20% of the total gameplay,  it is left to you 
to  discover  other possible ways of  comet-stopping,  the  reward 
being greater if your solution keeps the comet intact.  It is also 
noteworthy that the game does not stop if you fail in this primary 
mission, you can carry on exploring, the aim to accumulate as much 
cash as possible (in the form of ECU`s believe it or not..). it is 
left  to  you  to define your own game,  and you can end  up  with 
everything worth having in the Gamma system, or nothing.

It  is  worth noting that there is indeed  a  space-time  dilation 
effect as described by one A.Einstein which makes the hours  whizz 
by,  when you fly near the speed of light. WARNING it is very easy 
to  cut  deeply into the limited time available to  save  Eris  by 
doing  this.  Also  it is true you can load in a high score  saved 
from Mercenary (if you still have one after all this time....). My 
review was based on only my first hour or two of play, and did not 
go  very far,  so this is far from a complete picture of the game, 
which  would need several hours (days?) to appreciate more  fully. 
The  planet eris,  where the game starts,  is deserted having been 
evacuated,  there  are the other natives of the solar system  with 
whom  you can trade with,  or shoot at if that`s what you are  in 
to, but I have yet to really get moving to meet any of these.

In conclusion,  Damocles, subtitled Mercenary II, would seem to be 
a  re-write  of that classic,  expanded a hundred-fold,  with neat 
solid-vector  graphics.  In my view,  if it was released a year or 
two  earlier,  it  would  have blown the bollocks  off  any  other 
contemporary  software,  but in presentation it has aged and dated 
very slightly against the 1990 state of 3D graphics. It is still a 
fairly  good  looker,  and in terms of content will  be  extremely 
difficult to surpass at this time, and as such is recommended...
