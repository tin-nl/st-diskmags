
PROPHECY I THE VIKING CHILD
                        BY BEN DOLLEY

   Brian was a rather fun loving Viking child he enjoyed  working 
for  his master.All in all he was happy with  life.One  beautiful 
summers day when the sky was blue and the birds singing Brian was 
told to go and collect some herbs.Being a very polite little  boy 
he set of not minding to go a very long way.On the way he  looked 
at animals and listened to the birds sing.
   While Brian was gone a terrible magic tornedo swept across his 
village  destroying  everything.When Brian  returned  many  hours 
later  he  saw the village and searched for his family  he  found 
nobody  and  began to cry.While he was crying  a  strange  person 
appeared standing on a rainbow,it was Odin(a goodie)!Your  family 
has  been  kidnapped.to rescue them you must  travel  through  12 
worlds  to  finally meet with Loki(the baddie)kill him  and  your 
family shall be free.Hearing these words armed with only a dagger 
Brian set off...

    At first the game looks very similar to  Super  Wonderboy.The 
levels  scroll  horizontally and the objective is  to  kill  each 
level  nasty.To start off with you are only armed with  a  dagger 
but they can be upgraded.With money left by dead monsters you can 
by extra items from shops.

ITEMS

BOMBS:These  cost 20 gold for five they are dropped  and  explode 
when a monster lands on them.They can prove useful when you  drop 
a lot which is possible because of there low price.
BOLAS:These  cost 30 gold for 4 they fire in the direction  Brian 
is  facing.They  are  best used when fired on  a  monster  moving 
horizontally.
FIRESPRITES:They  cost 40 for 3 and home in to enemies.Best  used 
on small or flying enemies.
STUNS:They  cost  50 for 2 and hit every creature on  the  screen 
depleting their energy.Best used on many small enemies.
POTIONS:Cost  60 for one and kill all the enemies on  one  screen 
apart from the end of level nasties and the dark lord.
SPEED:This  doubles  Brian`s  speed  for  a  limited  amount   of 
time.Please don`t ask how much it costs,i have not a single  clue 
as i haven`t got far enough to buy it.
CLOAK:Costs  30  for one charge that makes you invincible  for  a 
short period of time.
GLIDE:Makes  you  jump a lot further and like the other  2  don`t 
last forever.
SWORDS:As  Brian only starts off with a dagger he can buy  longer 
and better swords that increase his fighting potential.
SHIELDS:Protect Brian from missile weapons.

OTHER ITEMS

THE HEART:They cost 10 to 15 gold and give back 1 energy heart.
HEART STACK:Give back all Brian`s life force.
EXTRA LIFE:Costs about 160 and well guess!
MONEY:Found  left laying behind by dead monsters in either 15  or 
20 gold pieces.

  To start off with you have 8 hearts these decrease if  you  hit 
into  monsters  or time runs out.An energy bar shows the  end  of 
level monster`s energy otherwise they take 2 or 3 hits.

     
EFFCTS

  The  thing i like about this game is the music it has  over  20 
pieces of music each being very enjoyable.This makes a refreshing 
change  from the normal music that just keeps on going until  you 
get  so bored you either turn the music off or stop  playing  the 
game.The screens showing the story line is both good very good in 
music  and  sound.The  graphics in all are very  well  drawn  and 
animated.
