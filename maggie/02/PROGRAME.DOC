 REAL PROGRAMMERS

  The easiest way to tell a real programmer from the crowd is  by 
the programming language they use. Real programmers use Assembly. 
Quiche eaters use Pascal. Nicklaus Wirth, the designer of Pascal, 
gave a talk once at which he was asked "How do you pronounce your 
name ?" You can call me by name pronouncing it "Veert" or you can 
call me by value pronouncing it "Worth" One can tell  imiediately 
from this statement that Nicklaus Wirth is a Quiche  eater.  Real 
programmers don't need parameter passing mechanisms, because they 
have no need for abstract concepts to get their jobs done -  they 
are  perfectly  happy  with a simple text  editor  a  good  macro 
assembler (Hisofts DevpacST version 2 - Only the best),  and lots 
of Beer.

 Real programmers do list processing in Assembly
 
 Real programmers do String manipulation in Assembly

 Real  programmers do Accounting (If they would even consider  it) 
in Assembly

 Real programmers do artificial inteligence in Assembly

If you can't do it in assembly language,  well its obviously  not 
worth doing



STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING.

 The academics in computing over the previous few years have  got 
into the "Structured Programming" rut.  They claim that  programs 
are  more easily understood if the programmer uses  some  special 
constructs and techniques.  No one agrees on these of course  and 
all the examples that have been produced can anvariably fit  onto 
a  single  sheet  of A4 paper,  This is  clearly  not  enough  to 
convince anyone.  Some Quick observations about real  programmers 
and their approach to structured programming.

  Real  programmers can write five page long DBRA  loops  without 
getting confused.

  Real  programmers  like complicated  arithmetic  statements  to 
determine  the  flow of control in the code - they make  it  more 
interseting to follow.

 Real programmers write self modifying code - especially if  will 
save 20 nanoseconds in the middle of a tight loop.

 Real programmers never use comments - The code is obvious.



 THE REAL PROGRAMMER AT WORK.

  Where does the real programmer work ?   What kinds of  programs 
are worthy of the efforts of such a talented individual?  You Can 
be  sure that no real programmer would be caught dead writing  an 
accounts-receivable  package in COBOL.  A real  programmer  wants 
tasks of earth shatering importance (Literally !!!!!!)

Some  of the most awesome programmers work at the jet  propulsion 
labrotory  in California.  Many of these know the entire  Voyager 
operating system by heart.  Allegedly one real programmer managed 
to  tuck a pattern matching program into a few hundred  bytes  of 
unused  memory  in  a voyager  spacecraft,  which  searched  for, 
located, and photographed a new moon of Jupiter.



 THE REAL PROGRAMMER AT PLAY.

 Generally the real programmer plays the same way he works - with 
computers,  The  real  programmer is constantly amazed  that  his 
employer  actually  pays him for what he would be doing  for  fun 
anyway (Allthough he is carefull not to express this opinion  out 
loud). Occasionally the real programmer does step out of his room 
full of terminals, so as to grab a breath of fresh air and a beer 
or six.

  At  a  party the real programmers are the ones  in  the  corner 
talking about OS security and how to get around it.

 At the beach the real programmer is the one drawing flow  charts 
in the sand

 At a funeral the real programmer is the one saying "Poor  George 
he nearly had that OS patch finished before he Karked it"

  At the supermarket the real programmer is the one  running  the 
cans  past the laser checkout scanner himself,  Because he  never 
could trust operators to get it right first time.



 THE REAL PROGRAMMERS HABITAT

 What sort of environment does the real programmer function  best 
in, this is very important for managers as real programmers don't 
come  cheap so it is important to place them such that  they  can 
get the work done.  The typical real programmer lives in front of 
a terminal, surrounding this terminal are :-

  Listings  of all the programs that they have  ever  worked  on, 
piled  in  roughly cronological order,  on every  available  flat 
surface.
 
  Some  half  a  dozen  or  so  partly  filled  cups  of  coffee, 
Occasionally there will be cigarette buts floating in the coffee.

 Unless the real programmer is really good,  there will be a copy 
of the computers BIOS listing, open at a particually intersesting 
place.

 Strewn about the floor will be wrappers from chocolate biscuits, 
of the type that are made pre-stale so they can't get any worse.

 In one of the desk drawers will be a stash of  drink,  including 
Vodka and plenty of beer, because as we all know some of the best 
coding is done when you are pissed.

  Occasionally  underneath the drinks is a flow  chart  template, 
left  there from many years before and not  touched  since.  Real 
programmers  write code,  not documentation - leave that  to  the 
maintenance people.



 IN GENERAL

  The real programmer is capable of working  thirty,  fourty,  or 
even fifty hours at a stretch,  under intense pressure,  in  fact 
the  real  programmer  prefers it that  way.  Bad  responce  time 
doesn't  bother  the real programmer,  in fact  it  provides  the 
chance  to  catch up on a little sleep  inbetween  each  assembly 
time.  If there is not enough schedule pressure on the programmer 
he tends to make things more interseting by working on some small 
but interesting part of the problem for the first nine weeks, and 
then finishing the rest of it in the last week,  in two or  three 
fifty  hour marathons.  This not only impresses the hell out  the 
real programmers manager,  but provides a bloody good excuse  for 
not doing any of the documentation.

 To sum up :-

  No real programmer works nine to five,  unless its the ones  at 
night.

  The  real  programmer  may keep  forgetting  the  name  of  his 
girlfriend, but allways knows the entire ASCII table by heart.

 Real programmers don't know how to cook,  Supermarkets are never 
open at three O'clock in the morning, Real programmers survive on 
loads of coffee, and pro-plus tablets for emergencies.


 And of course all the best programmers are roughly the same :-

 Reasonably tall.
 Long hair.
 Allways wear Black.
 Love good music. (Megadeath, Slayer, Onslaught, Faith no more)
 Never go to sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning.
 Own Atari ST computers.
 Program in 68000.
 Are totally insane, well mentalty unstable anyway.
 Hate Kylie and Jason.
 Can  usually  be found down the pub,  if  not  coding,  or  with 
  their girlfriend.

  If  you  fit at least nine of the above,  you too  could  be  a 
programmer, and, if so, good for you.
