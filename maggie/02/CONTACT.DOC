                         by Sammy Joe

I received a few letters by some guys from all over the world and 
they  suggested  to me to introduce a  new  section.  Well,  this 
section  as you can read at the top is called CONTACT ME.  As  it 
already says it asks you to contact somebody.  In other words, if 
you  want  to have some more contacts (only  legal  ones)  please 
write  to us and state you address clearly.  Maybe you  can  even 
give  us some background on yourself so the people  reading  this 
will know if you are their type of person or if you have the same 
interests on the computer. 
Please remember that piracy is illegal and therefore we cannot go 
along  with people sending us their address for swapping  pirated 
software.

So  here is the 1st person who is looking for contacts  all  over 
the  world  for swapping things and changing ideas.  If  you  are 
interested, write to:

Thanks Lasse,  it was a great idea. Sorry that I did not reply to 
your letter but I have taken up your idea so that should make  up 
for it !
