This article concerns the the release of the 1st Issue of Maggie:

Well, here it is already, the 2nd Issue of our Disk Magazine. Did 
you  ever wonder what trouble we have to go through to  get  the 
1st issue to you on time ? For the 1st Issue it was particularly 
bad as we had planned to release the magazine a week or so later. 
But as the Atari Show came up we decided that it would be a  good 
opportunity. 

I was supposed to have the ST Charts by Next on the Friday   but 
instead  of the disc I had a phone call from Zae in  the  evening 
telling me that they have just send it off and that I would  have 
the disc first thing in the morning. Well, Friday  came up, I had 
to go to school as usual.  At about 10 am I phoned my mum to find 
out whether or not the disc had arrived ?  The answer was  NO.  I 
phoned my mum several times more, but the answer stayed the same!
Pissed off as I was I went to the show.

In the evening I phoned ZAE, but he did not know anything either. 
As  the magazine was on the Computer for most of the Friday  many 
people came and tried it out and found a few bugs. When I arrived 
at home again that evening I began to fix one bug after the other 
until 1 o' clock in the morning of the 2nd of June. 

On  Saturday  I got up at about 8 o' clock so that  I  could  get 
started  right  away  including the Charts  at  the  moment  they 
arrived. Finally at 9 o' clock the post man rang the doorbell and 
here they were,  the ST CHARTS by Next. It took me about one hour 
to  incooperate the Charts.  At the show I decided to finish  off 
the 1st read me. 

The same day in the evening Spaz lay his hands on the mag and  of 
course,  he had to spot some more bugs that I had not noticed. So 
what did I do,  stayed up til 1.30 o' clock in the morning to fix 
them. 

Sunday  morning at the show I finished off the 2nd  read  me.  As 
Spaz  did not go to the show he spent some more of his so  called 
precious  time bug hunting in the magazine and to my surprise  he 
found quite a few more bugs.  After I talked to The Pilot of  the 
BBC,  who pointed out some more bugs, I decided to go bug hunting 
myself.  Indeed,  there were some more bugs in the 1st Issue  of 
Maggie,  like for example that you could highlight the picture or 
that bits of the picture got corrupted. 

A  lot  of the errors that SPAZ pointed out had something  to  do 
with his naff NEC disk drive and his faulty disk.  Keep in  mind, 
as soon as their is a read error (it does not matter how small it 
is)  the file will not be displayed on the screen and will or  if 
it is it will be badly corrupted !!

Anyway,  I also fixed these few bugs and included another  hidden 
function.  It is the Y key,  if you press it when viewing certain 
documents  you will get a message.  If you press it when  viewing 
the  wrong document,  you will have to press a key and  you  will 
also have to exit the document. 

That  evening when the program was completely finished I did  the 
last read me.  Alltogether the disk should now contain 3  readmes 
and should have only 2048 Bytes left on the disk !!!! 

If you have an older version,  send it to us and we will  replace 
it with the final version     (     do     not     forget      an 
SAE).  Sorry about all that but I wanted  to have as little bugs 
as possible in the 1st Issue. 

All in all I enjoyed it very much putting this first        issue 
together, (which  by  now is probably history to  everybody  !!!) 
writing  some of the articles and whatever there had to be  done. 
I hope that you enjoyed reading through this 1st Issue.
