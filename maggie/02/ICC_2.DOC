		THE SECOND PART OF THE ICC #1 PARTY

Now this little nasty raster error has been removed.

20:07 Slime
The demo-competition is over and out. Now all people will elect
the winner (it will be Nick of TCB - but wait for the official 
result!)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Saturday - 20:46
As expected the winner of the demo-competition is Nick from TCB 
with 49 points. Second winner is Ford Perfect from Black Monolith 
Team with 40 Points and third winner is Blue Devil from Gigabyte-
Crew. I think it's a bit boring that there were just three 
finished screens. Hexogen from TNT-Crew has kicked his sourcecode 
in trashcan coz' lack of motivation. TEX didn't get their screen 
work in 24 hours. I saw some previews of this screen and I think 
it's pretty good. You will see all screens in our megademo coming 
soon (???) called "Syntax-Terror". Perhaps released in september 
(it's not sure which year is meant here).
We also got a screen from The Lost Boys. It's a very nice screen 
but it was not possible to let it compete in the contest. All 
preworked stuff (except one logo and one font) were strictly 
forbidden. But this screen will also take part in our Syntax-
Terror-Demo. Nobody has seen this screen except me.

New Mode/DF leavin' here

Cobra,Killersoft,maxi and Snake
Saturday 20:55
We have just seen the ultralame g.f.a demo which was made by
guess who? the overlaaamerrss!! it's really a pack of shit...
we had a good laughter when we saw the 'hardware scrolling' in 
gfa!!! ahahah!!the spreadpoint demo 2 was so bad too...
where the useful to copy screen of others but wronger than
the original,really wronger!!!!
(he,he) a little message to humungus and arioch of the enpyrre: 
hope you'll never make children together coz dickhead 
(deckard : replicants sucker) could decide to masturbate
savagely phalus angels and that's illegal in france !!!!
We hope all the members of the overllaaaammmerss will die soon and 
burn in hell and that their ugly dick will be sucked off by a 
fucking son of a bitch who has AIDS and looks like a stinking 
woman. But you are already infected from yesterdays motherfucking.


Saturday 22:10  

Hello guys again it's Howdy on the keyboard, on my right side 
there is Maxi from the Replicants. He takes a little snack and
drinks coca-cola. The Replicants want to make a competition for
the best fuck to overlamers or empiire ass-lickers. Im sorry
that I must write such things, but the Replicants kill me if I
don't write such crap about you. Snake (without his big nose)
stands behind me with a baseball bate. I can do nothing, sorry.
The guys from TEX are trying to finish their screen but nobody
wants to code it further because everybody has enough from 
coding. Most of the guys which are here are playing games like
Battle Squadron on Amiga or eat some sausages. On my left side
there is jules (a good friend of maxi) and help me to write 
something. Oh some guys left the party now, bye, see you on the 
next. New Mode of Delta Force sits now on my right side and want
to type in some text.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat. 22:19 Guess who!
Snake is standing behind me and asks if I write some text about 
the above mentioned groups from France. But I don't know them and 
so I can't write bad things now. Snake told me that they are 
really lamers but that's his opinion.
At this point I want to write some personal fucking greetings.
They go to a motherfucking cocksucker called Michael B. who gave 
Questlord's address to the police. But the lame police found 
nothing coz' he has been warned by somebody else. Go to hell you 
little babyfucker.
I really don't like writing fuckings but for this asshole it's 
really necessary. Give him a kick if you meet him.
CU soon. Bye!

06/17/90       at 01:37 am      (Chaos, Inc. rules again)

A few guys still trying to play Midi Maze on a 12 computer net. 
Unfortunately there are some wires, that make problems. So we 
often get some "midi-ring boo-boos". Now, late at night, nearly 
all guys from the yesterdays and todays 24-hour programming 
competetion are fallen into a dreamless sleep. If you look at the 
screens, which are written during this demo competition you'll be 
very atonished what can be done in only 24-hours.
Escpecially Nick had done it once again. If I remembered right, he 
coded the sync-scrolling-routine in only half an hour.
I've read some of the upper messages, but I haven't found some 
description of the result of the demo competition....

Well, we started with six groups trying to give their best during 
the next 24 hours. The first who decided to give up programming 
was the group of New Mode, Slime and Axe. New Mode had to stop 
and the other two guys decided to stop. Why have had New Mode to 
stop? After the first problems with his Vektorball-Scroller he 
decided to go downstairs into the garden to drink some beers. 
As time goes by, the beer goes too. The second time I saw New 
Mode trying to climb the stairs up to out programming room. He 
was very dizzy and drunken. But not enough, he always runs around 
telling everyone how drunken he is, and if he will get another 
cigarette (well, let's call it a cigarette) his so called 
"Gstell" will break down. "Gstell" is the german word for "gears" 
(well, not exactly). That was the end of New Mode and his screen.

What about the screens?

At the end of the competetion there were 3 screens ready to show. 
One screen by TEX was still in work, but they haven't finished 
yet. So they got disqualified.
The first price was won by Nick of TCB with a fullscreen sync-
scroller, which scrolled some TCB-Logos over the screen. There 
were also an big scroller and afterwards an filled vektor cube 
rotating very fast on the screen. He has some musax, too.
The second price did go to BMT who impressed us with a strange 
scroller, which is best descriped as a relief-scroller. 
He also has two sinus waves who disturb each other and also some 
strange algorithms to calculate the music into this wave.

The third place was made by Blue Devil of the Gigabyte-Crew. He 
wrote a routine, which is able to rotate a Gigabyte-Logo very 
fast in ca. 8 VBLs per calculation. The logo changes angle and 
size all the time, zooming in and out very fast. Really 
impressive. Also a little board moved up and down with some 
messages printed on it.

You'll see all these screens in the so called "Syntax-Terror-
Demo" made by New Mode. Maybe sometimes this demo will be 
released too.

That's it for today guys, I wrote enough bullshit...

bullshit...bullshit...bullshit....bullshit...bullshit...bullshit



                                        (Third end of Chaos).


P.S: New Mode always sitting beside of me watching me typing all 
the nonsense into this MEGA ST 2 and trying to fix all my 
mistakes. But now he want's to write something on his own...so I 
have to leave the keyboard now, before New Mode will kill me....

          Arrrgh, help me.... Help! Arrrrrghhhhh.........

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 02:33

Ah yeah!! After all that crap written before, here's your guru 
back on this fucking bad Mega ST. Don't believe any of that 
bullshit stories written about me. They're simply NOT true. I 
never drank alcoholic drinks as all these lamers write. Chris 
wrote that Slime has painted some good shapes but they are really 
the worst shit ever pixeled by a so called painter.(SLIME:New 
Mode is a liar!!!) Chris of TGE is really a weirdo.
Another fucking greeting to a big loser called K-Oz who always 
writes bullshit about other members of our group.
Some strange things come to my mind by now: AUSSCHEIDER (just 12 
days to go to that fucking lame army here in good old Germany).
Snake just stumbled over the midi-cable and produced another 
"midi-ring boo-boo".
Slime is shouting some really uninteresting things around here. 
Some guyz are sleeping or trying to sleep, for example Blue Devil 
is lying under our table and is producing a very strange sound.
------------------------------------------------------------------

03:04 am 

Chaos again. After playing some more Midi-Maze I'm now tired and 
decided to go to sleep. I think 'Dirty Hairy' decided the same 
way than me.
Have a nice sleep.

By the way, the last few sides were written in nearly real-time 
by Chaos, Inc. and New Mode of Delta Force. We wrote during 
playing Midi-maze because we only have one Mide-Maze Terminal for 
two people. So one can play, and the other has to write.
But enough is enough now. To sleep or not to sleep.
In other words.... Good night....

----------------------------------------------------------------------

03:09 am      Chaos got up again. (Can't sleep, too loud)

---------------------------------------------------------------

          Axe

What's that? Going to bed so early? Well, at least we (Snake, 
Cobra, Killersoft, Axe, Howdy) were still playing Midi Maze. All other 
guys played until 4:30 which is very long already. But at that 
time we were not tired at all, so we continued shooting each 
other. It was great fun. We stopped doing that at 8 o'clock. Then 
we looked at some old demos until ES got up with sleepy eyes.
Now it's 10:45 and I have had breakfast.
In fact I am tired now and thinking about lying down for a while 
to get some sleep.
What we have learned in the last night:
Midi Maze is one of the best games ever!

   Good night, for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

11:16 SLIME

The winner of 'Midi-maze' is like always -ME- of TEX......... the 
winners in 'Battle Squadron' with a score of 1700350 are Cobra
and Killersoft of The Replicants.
The prize of the demo-competition for Nick was a golden disk on a 
plastic triangle, for -ME- in the 'Midi'-competition it was a 
golden Competition Pro glued on the plastic triangle and for the 
two members of 'The Repsquad' it was a bottle of 'Del(t)aforce - 
a port wine.
By the way, Chris is leaving now (very important message).

The party is now over and out. Most of the computers are thrown 
out of the windows and only a few people are still here.
Gigamegasupraextra thanxxxxxxx must go to the mothers of Delta 
Force for cooking some meals, but especially to the mother of
Chaos, Inc. for lending us the house and got back a pile of crap.

Hahaha, at the moment the freaks of Replicants must have too much
disks, 'cause they throw them around like crazy dogs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
12:50:00 

Now it's time to leave the party, we have done our last farts 
before going back(and some grand chelem) ahahah.....
we want to thanxs all Delta Force members who have wonderfully
organized this party(better organized than our own one!!!ah!ah!)
Especially Thanxs go to Chaos Inc. who,we hope,will excuse us
for the some bad troubles we have caused...we are really sorry...
Also greets to all the others guys who were all very cool
(especially Axe,Howdy,Slime and of course Erik)
Well so much text for now,we really have to get back now!!!!!

          The REPLICANTS...(c) 1990  v 0.99 beta test
-----------------------------------------------------------------
13:05:27  FP

Just said Bye-Bye to the french guys ... 

There are still some questions left:
- How many bottles are standing/lying around in this mess ?
- How many liters of coke/beer/water have been consumed ?
- What about the chip performance (it seems that some guys _ONLY_
  ate chips during the days!) ?
- How many KB of Disk-Maggie-stuff have been written ?
- How many MB of source code have been written ?
- How many NOP's have been used ?
- How many GB of new stuff have been copied ?
- How many bus cycles have been elapsed ?
- How many raster interrupts have been executed ?
- How many hours (in average) have been slept ?
- How many flies are sitting and flying and doing strange things
  (oops) in this room ?

Bye now ...

----------------------------------------------------------------
One week later exactly on friday 22nd of june at 11:17am...

This is New Mode again. The party is over since nearly one week. 
We got some requests to do another party next year. Perhaps we'll 
do, but this is not sure yet.
Mega sorry to some guys who weren't able to come.
I have to finish now coz' I have to send this text to DISK 
MAGGIE. Wait for our "Syntax-Terror-Demo" which will include all 
party-screens and some of our screens. The release date will be 
around september this year (but I think it will appear much 
later).
Please apologize all spelling mistakes.
Please apologize that there is no interview here (we tried to 
interview Nick of TCB but he was too lazy and too tired to write 
here (he programmed 24 hours non-stop).
Thanks for reading all the bullshit here.
 
The Union rules.................................
