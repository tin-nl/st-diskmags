First of all, I have no idea how long this utility has been out, 
but if it old then it's just too bad. I only brought it the other 
day after a hell of a lot of trouble getting hold of it.

This neat little program enables you to create any type of shoot-
em-up from Commando to Gridrunner. The program comes with three 
example games for you to use, one of which I honestly think could 
have been sold as a stand alone game - it's great.

The program is menu driven and your first job is to design 
sprites for your games. This is very easy and simple to do. Your 
next job is to design the background, this can be anything from a 
static screen to full scrolling mega-screens. Then you can design 
the level lay out, the enemys movement and start positions, your 
start position, the sound effects and anything else that takes 
your fancy.

As I already said, the program is totally menu driven and you 
need no programming knowledge to use it. Various optiond on the 
menu enable you to test your game with loads of lives, play the 
game as it should be, enemy shooting patterns, how many shots it 
takes to kill them, fire rate, bonus objects, fixed scrolling, 
push scrolling and no scrolling. This may seem like a long list 
of things, but it's only half of them! So you can really create a 
great game at the end of the day.

When you have written a game, you can save it as a stand alone 
game, so you don't have to have a copy of SEUCK to run them. The 
manuel is written well, with lots of humour and is very easy to 
use and understand.

To give ratings to this would be unfair, becuase as a utility 
it's something that you can't rate. What I would say, is if 
you've tried STOS and can't get the hang of it or you don't want 
to sit down for five hours trying to get a sprite to move across 
the screen, then this is the utility for you.

My only complaint about SEUCK, is that I had to move heaven and 
earth to get my copy of it, and now that I've got it, I can't put 
it down...

Now for a brief review of the three games that come with SEUCK...

Blood 'N' Bullets
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
This is a commando games, where you are a fearsome commando, 
stomping through the sub-tropical undergrowth, taking out any 
enemies lurking in the bushes. They throw everything at you, 
tanks, pill boxes, motorcycles, cuddly toys, kitchen sink and a 
battalion of their finest men... but like Rambo you come through 
unscatched. Well, apart from the gash across your beefy chest, 
that is. Pick up medals for extra points, but watch out for those 
mines and hidden enemies...


PsychoBlast
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
You are an arch wizard from the fat flung planet of Zizbod. Your 
life is threatened, yet again, by the evil Frank Trank and his 
Psycho Assassins. In an attempt to avoid confrontation you sink 
deep into the psucho matrix, where nobody can find you... But 
(gasp) you have been followed! The Psycho Assassins are more hep 
to the jive then you thought! So now you must defeat the evil 
minions of Frank Trank with your psycho blasts before they can 
reach you...


Slap 'N' Tickle
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
The ultimate shoot'em up. You are Slap Torg, the lone survivour 
of the Galactic Star Force, whose brave effort against the Empire 
was crushed like a bug. Pretty stupid, huh? But now you must go 
home by the back way, through the Tickle Zone. The Zone is a 
hyperspacial network spanning the entire rubber underlay of the 
galaxy, touching every point in the universe at once. You must 
battle your way through the space pirates which inhabit the Zone, 
in order to get home in time for Eastenders.
