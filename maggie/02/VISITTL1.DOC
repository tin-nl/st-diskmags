And here  comes one  more of these  inevitable  adventure reports 
that are a standard feature of every and any disk magazine....

Before I even start  telling  you about  my visit to Sammy Joe of 
the "LOST BOYS"  in  a  suburb of  London,  I  must  put  forth a 
warning :
  
TO ALL  THOSE  FREAKS  THAT  ONLY LIVE (AND DIE) FOR  THEIR ST's. 
DON'T  READ THIS ARTICLE AS YOU WILL BE  BORED OUT OF YOUR MINDS. 
I (O.W.) AM NOT RENOWNED  FOR MY KNOWLEDGE ON COMPUTER JARGON AND 
I MUST ADMIT TO BEING NOT OVERLY INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT IT, 
AS IT  WOULD TAKE UP A LOT OF MY  (SOMETIMES) PRECIOUS TIME (THAT 
MEANS I COULDN'T BOTHER,  AS I AM TOO GODDAMN LAZY).  I JUST TAKE 
IT EASY. ANYTHING  ELSE WOULDN'T  DO  YOUR STRESSED  HEART A  BIT 
OF GOOD EITHER.                                                                                                                                   
                              SO BE WARNED !!!!


PART I : 

This is how it all began :

Once  upon a time,  there was a sad little juvenile who had  just 
moved to boring old Geneva,  Switzerland. There was no sign of an 
Atari ST in this backwater (heard that somewhere before,  haven't 
you),  so  this  person  had not a lot do do.  It  was  a  boring 
existence and all he did all day long was vegetate and listen  to 
thrash  metal,  which came to the same results :  his  brain  was 
slowly but steadily rotting away.  What brain you might ask right 
now,  but I can assure you that he had some when I last saw  him. 
Well  anyway,  it was on a rainy sunday morning on the fourth  of 
February,  when  this  boy  (I can tell  you  now,  that  it  was 
Maulwurf)  got a phonecall.  While listening to the voices  which 
echoed  shallowly  through  the receiver he  got  more  and  more 
hyperactive...sorry I meant exited.  The person at the other  end 
of the line was none other than the infamous Sammy Joe, long time 
friend of Maulwurf.  The subject of the long and therefore rather 
costly  conversation was about a possible visit to London  during 
the forthcoming Easter holidays. Maulwurf being his reserved self 
immediately agreed before even having asked his always  concerned 
parents,  that do everything for our hero. Well, you all know how 
parents  are,  so  you  can imagine the heap  of  trouble  little 
Maulwurf was in. Cautiously he approached his mother (she was the 
more understanding of the two). Anyway, that was the last anybody 
ever heard of him. 

                      *********************                

PART II :

Well,  that  was a rather uncomfortable view of how things  could 
have  happened,  but as I'm here to tell you about the good  time 
I've  had  with  the Schussler Family (if any of  you  are  still 
interested) I got through alright. 

Firstly a short introduction on humble me :  my name is how  most 
of  you  will have figured out by now (it says so at the  end  of 
each  of my brilliantly written and researched  articles)  OLIVER 
WAGNER.  I possess several nicknames. The one is Maulwurf, for to 
me  not  known reason and the other is ALC for  self  explanatory 
reasons.  For all you astronomical freaks,  my sign of the zodiac 
is  lion,  as I was born on the 1st August 1972  (swiss  national 
day).  I  measure  1m 72cm (make that 73 or 74) and weigh  in  at 
about  67  kg  (make that 64 kg).  I like  blondes  and  redheads 
(females) with ...  (If you say one more word, this mag will have 
to  be banned for the under eighteens,  so that would  mean  you. 
Keep your phantasies for yourself. The Ed.)...with nice ti...cian 
blue eyes.  I like listening to thrash metal (Slayer, ACID REIGN, 
Obituary,  Death,  Kreator,  Coroner and sometimes even Metallica 
(here's to Richard Karsmakers of whats-it-called ?)). My favorite 
drink  is Cider but I will also make due  with  snake-bite-blacks 
and smooth scotch. At the moment I am broke and I am sunburned. I 
wear glasses and have relatively long hair. 
Who wants to marry me ????

                      ********************* 

PART III :

I had to book the flight about two months in advance and still  I 
was  lucky to get a seat.  I even had to skip school for one  day 
(deary  me  !!) as my plane took of on Friday 6th April  at  8.40 
from Cointrin Airport / Geneva.  But first I still had to do  the 
packing  among  other various items such as  clothing  and  shoes 
where other inevitable objects like :

35   Tapes full of metal 
25   Blank tapes full of background noise
50   Empty 3.5" disks (single sided)
27«  3.5" disks full of Demos and PD-Programs
180  Swiss francs
150  German marks
100  British pound
3    Condoms (plain, as I am mostly quite conservative)
2    Giant bars of Toblerone (as original gifts)
1    Aiwa Walkman (or rather mini cassette-player)
1    European Community (FRG) passport
1    Return ticket
1    Barfbag (Germans always take precautions)
1    Nasal  Spray  against  my still  persisting  Allergy  against 
     pollen 

All  very interesting so I will continue now (applause erupts  in 
the background as the TV is running downstairs).

Well,  the  day of my departure for dear old England had  finally 
arrived and I still had so many things to do. Like driving to the 
airport and checking in. I was so exited (You don't say. The Ed.)
Anyway, after  saying  a  quick  farewell  to  my  taxi  (parents 
actually)  I nipped inside to the duty-free zone. The rest I  can 
spare and this story continues after my arrival in London/Gatwick 
where I suddenly I realized that I was deaf.  During the flight I 
had had to sit beside a little grey old woman that was herself  a 
little  deaf.  Accordingly  was  her volume while  keeping  up  a 
never ending  conversation with me (it was really  a  monologue). 
Since  I am used to quite a bit of loud music in concerts I  soon 
got over this problem. The next problem however, popped up almost 
as soon as the other one was solved.  Where was Sammy Joe who was 
supposed to pick me up at the airport. I could have gone by train 
but I neither had his address nor phonenumber.  After waiting for 
about half an hour I decided to do something about this miserable 
situation  I had been unwittingly placed.  I called the  operator 
(100)  and asked for the number of a certain "Michael  Schussler" 
as  I  didn't know the christian name of his father to  whom  the 
phone (and the bill) was/is registered.  As it was,  she couldn't 
seem  to find the person  I was talking about.  I still  remember 
her!!  voice as she said the most romantic thing anybody had ever 
said to me :                   
     
     "Shall WE (she actually said "we") try another number"

To this day, I still don't know which body belongs to this almost 
godly  voice.  If I ever find out,  don't let me be  disappointed 
(silent prayers make their way up top).
Since   there   aren't  as  many  "Schusslers"  living   in   the 
King(Queen)dom  of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (God  bless 
'em  all) and only one in Teddington, I soon got the  number  and 
Michael  on the phone.  It all turned out to have been  Michael's 
fault : he had been expecting me the next day.


PART IV :

Day One (Friday, 6th April '90): 

After  this  rather failed start things soon got of to  a  faster 
pace.  I  woke up rather early as I was dreaming about the  voice 
from yesterday.  In it she was kissing me passionately all  over. 
As it turned Michael's sausage dog "Poldi" was sniffing right  in 
my face,  so he somehow persuaded me to get up on time.  This day 
was spent to get me up to date with new demos (MINDBOMB DEMO) and 
anything  else  which had cropped up during my one  year  absence 
from worldly news (I live in Geneva,  remember!).  Also I  pumped 
myself full of  "HEADACHE-FLIES-AWAY-AND-YOU-WILL-BE-RESTORED-TO-
YOUR-OLD-AND-LIVELY-SELF PILLS" which didn't do a world of  good. 
What didn't aid me either (but was a heck of a lot more fun  than 
resting) was me ruining my eardrums through listening to new  and 
never heard of groups like the "Spermbirds".  After  trying,  but 
failing to rustle up a few of my ex-schoolmates, we decided to go 
to the "Anglers" pub by Teddington lock,  to replenish my  rather 
depleted  alcohol  level  and  thus  my  creative  restraint  was 
forgotten  for one evening,  as it was for many yet to  come.  We 
ended this day on a rather silly note, pretending to be Jesus and 
other  (in)famous personalities of world history (this  spectacle 
you  should  have  witnessed  as it would  have  shown  you  what 
adolescents are capable of when they think no one is watching).


Day Two (Saturday, 7th April '90): 

In  spite  of a rather annoying (splitting) headache  of  unknown 
origin,  Michael  and  me  decided to head in  the  direction  of 
Carnaby  Street  as  I  had  to  stock  up  on  my  heavy   metal 
accessories.   While waiting for the train which would take us to 
Waterloo  Station smack in the  middle of London,  we met two  of 
Michael's  friends from school.  So instead of being  lonely  all 
day, we now had ample female company. 
Ulrike  and  "Bob" as the other girl was nicknamed proved  to  be 
quite a bore (at least on our first unintentional "rendez-vous"). 
Visiting  the  "National  Gallery" proved to be  the  incident  I 
approved  of  least during my stay in  mostly  beautiful  Greater 
London. Well, two !! hours later it was finished, or rather I was 
finished.  Van  Gogh's,  Rembrandt's,  Leonardo  da  Vinci's  and 
Michelangelo's  were occupying my stressed brain.  I was in  dire 
need for some real art. It was time to go to Carnaby Street about 
which I had heard so much,  but had never had time to visit, even 
during my four years in Great Britain.  I was wondering what  had 
happened to the craziest street of the Sixties and Seventies when 
I hadn't even been born or thought about.  Was it still the  same 
old self or had the tooth of time taken its toll. My expectations 
were met and even bettered or worsened,  however you wish to view 
it.  None  of the old glamour was left and it all  seemed  rather 
sterile and glum.  What was worse was that I didn't even find any 
patches for my jacket. 
After a quick stop at the local "Hamburger-throw-in" we made  our 
way  towards the world-famous "Marquee" rock  concert-hall. There 
Michael  and  me (the girls had quit us as they didn't  think  it 
worthwhile to go anywhere near the "Marquee" as Metal band  often 
play there) inquired about the next gig being performed. For once 
my luck was in :  this exact evening there was and American  band 
"Soundgarden" plus support (the Beyond) playing. 
After a quick return home,  a change of clothes (metal like),  we 
returned to  the "Marquee", where we joined the queue  which  was 
already forming. The evening temperatures in downtown London were 
rather annoying as you came close to freezing of your vital parts 
and wearing only t-shirt under a jeans-jacket wasn't particularly 
helpful  either.  A quick cider from the off-licence from  across 
the road helped us to cheer up. 
Once inside,  Michael showed me around a bit,  as he knew his way 
about. After one more pint "the Beyond" made their appearance and 
with it came the bore.  They were awful. Their music stank, their 
performance  was made to sleep to and that was what  most  people 
did.  The  only variety we had during this part of the gig was  a 
frantic search for someone's lost contact lenses and the  almost- 
burning   of  someone  else's  trousers.   Half  an  hour   later 
"Soundgarden" made their appearence. They play like a band out of 
the Seventies,  warmed up for the Nineties.  They thoroughly ooze 
with brute force and I think this is how metal will sound in  the 
non  too  distant  future  (Jesus  and  Amen).  The  concert  was 
exhausting work and afterward I had earned myself another  drink. 
We arrived home with the last train at around twelve something.


Day Three (Sunday, 8th April '90):

Not a lot  happened on this, a rather dreary and rainy day. After 
having  breakfasted  Michael  laid before me his  plans  for  the 
following days,  with some suggestions and hints from me. We also 
had to complete a  dinner plan for the next one and a half weeks. 
While playing (raping it actually) with one of Michael's guitars, 
the  "Lost  Boys"  member  told me about his  plans  for  a  disk 
magazine,  which he intended to call "DISK MAGGIE". His elaborate 
explanations finally persuaded me to actively participate in  his 
brainchild.  He told me about the work I would be facing and that 
I wouldn't even get any monetary reward.  Apart from any personal 
satisfaction  I would/could derive from this work,  I would be  a 
very lonely person(apart from surprise visitors by my Editor). To 
this day, I still don't know if I regret this decision. With most 
of my leisure time devoted to typing my fingers raw to the  bone, 
my  (I  must  admit still  prospective)  girlfriend,  is  drawing 
further  and  further  away from me and I  have  no  confirmation 
whatsoever if anybody is reading my work (Enough of this  drivel. 
Get back to work immediately.  The Ed.).  (After blowing my  nose 
hard  into  my sleeve,  I realize that I am  wearing  a  t-shirt. 
Thoroughly disgusted I get back to my work.) 
Michael decided one of the best possible opportunities for a  new 
disk magazines to get started is to feature a great  article.  We 
made up our minds about interviewing F.A.S.T. (Federation Against 
Software  Theft) which you can read in the first issue  of  "DISK 
MAGGIE".   The  time  we  actually  spent  on  it  is  absolutely 
astounding. The actual research (questions, phonecalls, taping of 
questions)  and then the writing of the article (editing of  tape 
and typing it) took us about one week (or even more since I  lost 
count  of the hours we actually worked on it).  Several times  we 
worked  in shifts.  While Michael and his dog was sleeping I  was 
working  and then while I was working,  Michael and his dog  were 
sleeping. Like that we defeated several nights. 


Day Six (Wednesday, 11th April '90):

After  three days and nights hard work we decided that we had  to 
bring  some more spice into our existence.  So we went to  London 
once more to spend our hard earned money. 
Since  our  primary reason of life is to listen to  metal  (well, 
Sammy  Joe's is the ST) we just had to pay a visit  to  "Shades". 
The world-famous heavy metal record store is situated around  St. 
Annes Court in Soho (we didn't know the exact address either, but 
you just can't miss it). Michael decided to treat himself to ACID 
REIGN's  "The Fear" and "Moshkinstein" with his  favourite  track 
called "Motherly Love" with it's theme derived from  "Psycho".  I 
was  looking  for  a  sampler  from  the  label  Earache   called 
"Grindcrusher" with everything from "Napalm Death over Carcass to 
Bolt Thrower".  Alas my luck was out having a date, as I couldn't 
find it.
After  our standard stop in an  "Eat-as-fast-as-your-belly-aches-
afterwards "restaurant"", we took the tube towards Covent Garden. 
There  we  were  delighted to find ourselves  surrounded  by  the 
typical  if  somewhat dry British  humour.  These  comedians  try 
absolutely anything to make other people laugh.  I mean there was 
one guy that was absolutely taking the piss out off everybody and 
anything he could lay his eyes on and still people were  laughing 
about (or at) him.  There were two guys each armed with a  guitar 
and two absolutely brilliant voices that could have competed with 
anybody named BROS,  Kylie Minogue or (let's be audacious)  Jason 
Donovan.  And  all that without microphones or fancy  amplifiers. 
After  having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves for at least  an  hour 
(and  having given plenty) we made our way home...  the  F.A.S.T. 
article was waiting impatiently. 
Once arrived in our homely fields (about three o'clock) we worked 
about three hours more on our (your) article,  then we made plans 
for the evenings.  Michael called some of his english friends and 
together we decided to have a video orgy.  I chose "the Tall Guy" 
since  I  think that Rowan Atkinson is on of the  best  comedians 
around today.  Well,  it was a disappointment, but not because of 
the film,  but only because only couples  arrived.  Well,  though 
luck.  But  this  didn't stop us having  some  decent  fun.  Mike 
produced   (he   thought  rather  surprisingly)   a   bottle   of 
"Thunderbird"  and a few cans of "Heineken"  beer.  After  having 
downed  several  pints,  we  were  in the  right  mood  for  some 
excitement.  We  picked out the telephonenumber of my  supposedly 
ex-girlfriend (I tell you it isn't true,  but they (Mike and  Co. 
still take the piss out of me)).  Well, I  called anyway and when 
Josephine*  (*the  name has been edited by the  Ed.)  lifted  the 
receiver  I  sort  of pretended to be a  Jean-Pierre  from  Paris 
(speaking  English with a French accent (though I'm German))  out 
for fun (you know what I mean).  At first she didn't respond  and 
at  second she didn't either.  When Michael called a few  minutes 
later stating that he had received a similar phonecall,  she  was 
still a bit dumbfounded. So ended another FUN-FILLED day. 


Day Seven (Thursday, 12th April '90): 

This  day was a totally relaxing day and except for a  few  walks 
with the dog and a party the evening,  not a lot  happened.  This 
was  the  return-match  of Paul (one of the  guys  from  the  day 
before).  Before  going to this party we did some  shopping  :  a 
gallon of "Strongbow Cider",  a litre bottle of "Smirnoff"  wodka 
and a few cans of good ol' "Heineken".  Well,  I had to get drunk 
once during my stay in London !
After a march of about three miles (we got of at the wrong stop), 
we finally arrived at Paul's house. The party was already in full 
swing.  Two  actually.  Paul's was upstairs and his sister's  was 
downstairs (with Aciiiid Music.  Jesus Christ Almighty).  After a 
relatively boring start things soon got better,  as I opened  the 
cider  bottle.  This was soon emptied and Mike and  me  retreated 
into an empty room,  were we started on the "rest".  Although  we 
had  generously donated the beer to the others we kept the  wodka 
and the other two-litre bottle of cider. As Mike seemed very keen 
on the wodka, I let him have it, as I was entirely satisfied with 
the cider. My "secret" trick before downing a couple of fermented 
or distilled drinks I eat a packet of peanuts.  The result can be 
seen and admired. After nearly all of the cider (Mike needed some 
to  flush  the wodka down) there was nothing to  be  noticed.  It 
could  have been tea that I had been drinking.  The only  problem 
was my frequent use of the "restroom". Michael was better off. He 
only  used  it  once.  But then it was for about  two  and  three 
quarters  of an hour,  for the reasons most of you will  possibly 
have  encountered  after the consumption of three quarters  of  a 
bottle of wodka.  Well,  since I know how it can feel I kept  him 
company in a self-sacrificing manner, off course company. 


Day Eight (Friday, 13th(!!) April '90):

The  Day After.  Hangover Day.  After awakening with a  splitting 
headache,  we made our way home.  Mike was suffering. Oh, how was 
he  suffering  (a  bit  of  malicious  joy  shimmers  through  my 
concerned looking surface).  That whole day was lost,  as Michael 
spent  most of it in bed,  trying to forget how life had  treated 
him the night before.  Mike's father decided to have a good  idea 
and treat us to a chinese take-away.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and 
treated myself to Sammy-Joe's portion.  While eating Mr.Schussler 
told us about a venture he would undertake the following day.  If 
any of us would care to join him, we would be more than welcome. 
What would happen was following :  get up at around four o'clock, 
take-off about fiveish. Drive to Sherness on the North-East coast 
of Southern England.  Arrival at about six-thirty.  Try to stop a 
bus  from  a  certain German travel group getting  of  a  certain 
ferry.  Get  dictionary  which  had been ordered  and  was  being 
brought over by the salesman on this exact bus.  Miss it and  you 
have to drive all the way to Nottingham Forest (100 miles to  the 
north of London) the destination of the bus.
So  far the situation.  It all seemed rather simple  when  viewed 
from some distance.  Although Michael's stomach was still playing 
up a bit, he reluctantly agreed as he thought that some fresh sea 
air would do him a bit of good.
