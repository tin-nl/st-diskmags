Welcome to DRAGONS LAIR, another game that comes on loads of
disks and features more stunning graphics and a hefty price tag 
to go with it.

Cast your mind back to SPACE ACE. This was a game that featured 
over 30 different screens, loads of graphics and not very much 
playability. Well now Readysoft have followed in it's footsteps 
and produced DRAGONS LAIR.

In this game, it your job to guide Dirk on a rescue mission so 
that you can save the infamous princess. You start off on a 
bridge outside the castle and you have to cross it. Halfway 
across, you fall through a hole and are attacked by something 
large and slimey that emerges from the water. After despatching 
with this creature, you must then enter the castle to do what 
every reluctant hero never wants to do...

I would have thought that Readsoft would have learnt from their 
mistakes with SPACE ACE and added more playability and more 
screens, but sadly, they haven't. DRAGONS LAIR have only 12 
screens and even less to do in the joystick department then SPACE 
ACE. Readysoft have tried to solve this by repeating some screens 
and flipping others, but at the end of the day, DRAGONS LAIR is a 
total waste of money and time.

My advice to Readysoft, would be to withdraw DRAGONS LAIR and 
when they've finished on ESCAPE FROM SINGES CASTLE, release them 
as a double pack for the same price and you'll then be able to 
play DRAGONS LAIR as it should be!

As a last comment, I remember when DRAGONS LAIR and ESCAPE FROM 
SINGES CASTLE came out on the eight bit computers. They were a 
lot better than the sixteen bit versions in playabilty.

So, now it's time for the ratings... (Sorry, Readysoft!)

GRAPHICS:  98%  These are fantastic!
SOUND:     85%  Good soundtrack on some screens.
APPEAL:    30%  None.
OVERALL:   55%  As a demo DRAGONS LAIR is great, as a game it's a 
                waste of money.
