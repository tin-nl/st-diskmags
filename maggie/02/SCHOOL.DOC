                            by TLB

And another hidden article... What else can I say ? This one here 
was pretty badly hidden wasn't it ? Currently I am still watching 
Germany playing England (England has caught up now and the  goals 
are  1:1,  I was just told that it is only one more  minute  till 
extra time!!!).  There are no major improvements in this issue to 
the last one,  except that I removed a few more bugs. I really do 
not know what I am supposed to type here.

Oh hang on,  I just got an idea, you would not believe of whom we 
got  a letter !!  It is a female Atari ST user  !!!!  This  woman 
writes  to us and tells us that she is a great fan of  our  demos 
and that she bought the Mindbomb demo at the 16 Bit Fair BUT that 
it does not quite work !!!  Her problem is that it loads fine  up 
to  the  main menu but then just does not load any of  the  other 
screens  from their onwards !!  Our answer to that  is,  as  many 
others  appear  to have the same problem,  go  and  buy  yourself 
another computer on which it works !!!  No,  serious now, we have 
no  idea what has gone wrong with the loader as we use  the  same 
loader  to  load the main menu as we use to  access  the  various 
screens  !!!  We have examined our code again but could not  find 
anything wrong with it.  The only suggestion we have to make  is: 
First  run  the screen by BBC and then some of the  others  might 
work !!!   Some guy from Germany wrote to us saying that he has a 
loader with which it is possible to access most of the screens (I 
think that it is still not possible to access 3 screens, but that 
is still better than nothing !!).  We will try to get the  loader 
of  him  and then include it in the next issue of  Maggie  (which 
will be released in mid September!!!).

I  bet  that you have never heard the musix on the main  menu  or 
have you ?  Well if you have not,  here are some explanations  of 
the guys who did this great tune.  The tune us by Count Zero from 
Electronic  Images.  All the member of the Lost Boys reckon  that 
already  in his first stages one can compare his musix  with  the 
tunes by Mad Max.  He wrote this tune within about 2 days which I 
reckon  is very good.  At this stage we would like to  thank  him 
again  and say that we would be very very happy to use his  musix 
in future too !!!! (this is a little bit for the football freaks: 
we are now in first half of the extra time and one of the English 
guys got booked !!).  This here is a little bonus for the  people 
reading  this here,  if you would like to use  his  tune,  simply 
unpack  the file on the disk called COUNT.DAT and then from  your 
program  jump(jsr) to musix+28 to turn the musix on and  then  if 
you  want  to turn it off again simply jump  (JSR)  to  musix+32. 
Pretty  simple eeh (I hope that you (Count Zero) do not  mind  me 
explaining  it  here,  but I assume that you want your  musix  to 
spread !!!!!) .  I think that that is is from me for now,  I will 
go downstairs now in order to get some food !!!!!

  
This line here is the 1st line on the second A4 page in 1st  word 
plus,  I think that we sould have some more lyrics  now.....  The 
lyrics  are (as in the last issue) from the German hardcore  band 
carrying the name SPERMBIRDS:

The next song is dedicated to Tim MOSS (Manikin):     

                         B E D   T O O L

How do your make your money ? 
I think it is on your back
And hwo do you get that raise ? 
Your boss, he knows the facts
Cause it is all give & take
And the only thing you need to know
Is the parts you have to shake
And the part you have to blow

Your a bed tool, bed tool
Your just a bed tool, baby

If you want to sell yourself
Why use a middle man ?
Just do what you do best
With money in the hand
And you won't need your shots
For the disease you'll spread
It's called incompetence
It don't come from giving head....


That's it again,  I am still watching football and I am very sure 
that they are going to loose now although they are playing really 
good  but we are going to have these 11 metres kicks and  Germany 
is carp in them.   Ah well there goes the final whistle,  shit, I 
just hope that Germany will win,  otherwise Spaz And Manikin will 
tell  me in all the future years that England is a lot better  at 
playing football and that Germany is carp (that really pisses  me 
off!!!!!).    I wonder how many people are watching this  crucial 
scene on television  at this very moment !! Did you know that the 
use of the electricity and the use of water rises drastically  in 
the breaks,  yeah you guessed it, everybody rushed to the toilet, 
to have a cup of tea and all sorts of things !!!! 

Bloody hell, I have written much bullshit here in this article. 

This here are some special messages to various persons:  

This first one goes to MICHAEL OF TEX:
Vielen Dank fuer die Geburtstagskarte die Du mir geschickt  hast, 
hat mich wirklich gefreut. Wie waers wenn Du mir mal wieder Deine 
Adresse  schickst da ich sie nicht habe  !!!!  Danke.  Vielleicht 
sehen wir uns ja einmal !!!!!  Macht ihr eigentlich noch ein Demo 
? 

This second message goes to STEFFEN OF NEW MODE:
Vielen Dank fuer euren mega langen und vor allem spitzen  Artikel 
von  eurer  Party.  Falls ihr noch einmal eine macht  werden  wir 
sicher  kommen !!!  Keep up the good work and send me the  Syntax 
Terror Demo as soon as it is finshed!!!! 
 
 YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES TES  YES

I bet you wonder what all these YES's are about ? Simple, Germany 
just  beat England with the 11 metres thing (I have no idea  what 
it is called in English !!!) By the way,  this probably makes  me 
one of the happiest guys tonight. To be honest I feel a bit sorry 
for  the  Englishs who played their best football  in  the  whole 
turnament  !!   Let's stop the football stuff again and  continue 
with the messages !!!


This next message goes to the CAREBEARS :
Hi  guys,  what do you think about this second issue ?  On  which 
date are you coming to Marseille ? I will arrive there at 7.20 (I 
think)  in the morning on the 21st of July !!!  I will then  stay 
there for 10 days !!!! We should go for a drink then !!!!!!!


Message to,  oh,  just stuff the messages and continue with  some 
more drivel...

I  have  got another two exams before my holidays  and  they  are 
geography  and  chemistry.  In must pass both of them  because  I 
might  have to repeat the year if I fail them (I suppose  that  I 
should  be revising instead of typing all this carp,  but on  the 
other hand,  reading something about a desert in Africa does  not 
really turn me on and therefore you will have to put up with more 
of  this...  I  just about forgot a test,  I must  also  pass  my 
driving  test (which is probably the most important test  of  the 
three).  By the looks of it,  I will not be getting my test  date 
before the summer holidays !! Did you know that if you want to do 
your  driving  test you must read one of  these  stupid  booklets 
called the Highway Code ? One of the rules in the states that you 
MUST (and I stress must !!!) drive on the RIGHT side of the rode, 
but then,  when you actually drive on the right side of the  road 
you get told off by the policeman !!!  But when you read on a bit 
further it tells you to drive on the left side, now this sounds t 
me like a contradiction. First it tells you to drive on the right 
and then on the left.  To be honest with you,  the right side  is 
the right (meaning correct) side for me,  but then these Englishs 
have  to drive on the wrong side again.  I wish that  they  would 
make up their minds !!!! 

Do you know what the following means ? :
 - to lead someone a dance
Well,  I did not know what that meant until this morning when  my 
English teacher told me to know it by heart from now on,  for the 
one's still wondering what it means I will give you a definition:
to confuse somebody deliberately.  Now, why do you have to say it 
so complicated if there is an easy way ?    

Let's have another one:
to get our bracks up - this here means to be very annoyed

I reckon that this is definitely the end of this hidden  article, 
I  admit  that it probably is not as good as the last one  but  I 
just  had  no  idea what I could write about.  I  hope  that  you 
enjoyed it anyway !!!!
