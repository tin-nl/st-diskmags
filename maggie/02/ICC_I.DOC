
                            I.C.C. #1

               ( International Coding Conference )

                held by Delta Force of THE UNION
       
             from the 14th to the 17th of June 1990               

             somewhere in the south-west of germany          

    The official party report licensed to MAGGIE by Lost Boys

Welcome!
In the next minutes (hours???) you will read something about this 
meeting ...

Actually some guys tried to shoot a cow using a laser gun. This 
is probably not something you would expect to be done on such a 
meeting. Don't worry, other activities to be admired are: 
copying (using Fcopy; Hi Martin!), playing (on PC-Engine), watching 
demos (actually some 3D stuff from some french guys), and even a real
programmer (yes indeed, Chaos,Inc. is sitting next to mine trying to
find some sense in a disassembled listing of NeoChrome V2).
(Ain't these the activities you expect ???)

Well, in order to write a long, a very long, a very very long article,
everyone who likes can now write what ever he wants to.

July 14; 22:20:35   Ford Perfect of BMT

 Just wrote some kinda introduction.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This will look like this; date, time, name and then the message.
Now let's go ...


[Message from editor: You may write in german or french, we will
(hmmm, try to ...) translate it !!!]

Here is Chaos, Inc. (Delta Force) typing on this fucking old 
keyboard of this lousy STE. I hate changing other peoples 
programs, but in the special case of NEOchrome I'll make an 
exception.
But I tell you..... If you'll ever see NEOchrome 2.0 examine the
beautiful repeat control of each button that you can klick on.
I have stopped programming the repeat control routine, because 
every few seconds the whole NEOchromes chrashes..... (that's the 
life of a programmer, isn't it.). So I have to do some amusement 
e.g. typing this little message, writing my angry brain out of my 
head.
Maybe I should drink some beers, maybe one, two, eigteen or 
23?....
At the right side of me is sitting SLIME of Delta Force copying 
one disk after the other without just looking at his stuff....
(Crazy swapper, isn't he????).... Enough laestering...

Now it's time to stop writing, maybe I will continue someone, 
somewhere, sometimes.....


               - May the Force be with you, always... -


                                                  (End of Chaos)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
06/14/90  Time: 22:57

This is New Mode on the keyboard. Slime is sitting beside me and 
is playing a shoot-em'up game on the Amiga using headphones coz 
all the guys here can't stand all this noise coming out of his 
monitor. Such a stupid guy, just gambling or copying all night 
long!
I'm very sorry that all the guys from The Lost Boys and some 
swedish crews can't come to this party. We still expect some 
groups to arrive tomorrow.
Tomorrow there will start a 24-hour-demo-competition here in this 
room. I'm impatiently waiting for it.
That's it for now.                                   (New Mode)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
06/14/90 Time: 23:09:??   Chris of TGE

Hey ya! I'm just sitting here in a corner typing this few lines 
of madness. Michael of TEX is just standing behind of me talking 
to Chaos Inc.. Wait for Neochrome 2.0. It will be wonderful. At 
the moment we have two amigas and fourteen(!) STs here. By the 
way, Chaos Inc. has just saved the final version of Neo 2.0 ....
Oh, I nearly forgot it. Happy birthday to Michael Schuessler!!!       
How do you feel now? Another year for you to be an adult. Hope 
you won't give up waiting for it! I also greet to two other 
members of The Garlic Eaters: ACCO and Nick !!!! Hey I'm leaving 
now getting another beer. See ya!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
06.14.90 TIME:23.29.25   Cobra & Snake of the Replicants
  
we are sitting now in front of this fucking bad german keyboard 
trying to type some bullshit one more time. It's a great party  
without the overlamers and the e...... (of lamering).Tomorrow 
we'll try to get our screen made by fury in 3 days for the demo
competition. We have 10 hours to wait Maxi and Scott because
we are only two foreigners at this party and all the guy speak
german and not a little bit of french except -ME- of Tex
who speaks french strangely....(he,he,he)
all the best crew are here and only some great guys are missing
here like:The lost boys, Vapour from Automation ,etc....
nothing to crack in germany (Lame original supply country)..
bye bye from the replicants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
06/14/90   23:57:12

Once again Chaos, Inc. of the Delta Force....

The whole thing is done! I just can't believe it, but NEOchrome 
2.0 is finished. Try to get one. Make the Neo-test, enjoy NEO and 
so on.... Slime beside of me has also finished playing "Battle 
Squadron" after 2 hours of non-stop-playing with the headphones 
of Chris because nobody can listen to this boring musax. 
(remember, we must listen to it all the time...).

Now it only ten seconds to midnight:
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
- another day in history... -




Here it is. The second day of the I.C.C #1.

And again it's Chaos, Inc. who tries to bore you with his always-
the-same-speech.

Slime wants to make me write....  So have a nice night, and keep 
on hacking....
                              (Second end of Chaos)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the next one:


Hello! Dis is SLIME! After CHAOS, INC. has finished with writing 
he gave me a kick so that i must write something.....O.k., after 
ending playing 'Battle Squadron' with a highscore of 1.375.000 
i'm very tired. The lame face of CHAOS, INC. sits besides me and 
nervs. I think that this party will make history because it's the
1st one which is nearly four days long. 
The sky is black, clouds are hanging around and the weather is 
not the best - what shalls? in one and a half day we want to make
a barbeque party and I hope that it will be better then.
Dis was it for now...............

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Next one:
June 15  00:23

A very nice game's running next to the ST next to this one: 
JAMBALA 2 !!!!!!
Great graphix, rasters, (hard-)scrolling ...
Go and buy it (if it's finally released)

Ciao

Hi! I feel quite okay that all lamers are far from this place. 
Here are about 20 people, but I am sure that somebody will 
include a complete memberlist somewhere.
Usually it's Richard Karsmakers job to write such long text 
files, but as he is not here today everybody will write some 
stuff.
From Delight the following members are here: Zeno, David 
Lightman and Axe. Jabba is somewhere else. He is at the ten-year 
celebration of school end.
On every second ST that is standing around here, there is 
Dragonflight running. On all other STs there is Fcopy 3.0. This 
might please the author of Fcopy, who is also here. This guy 
from the Black Monolith Team, who wrote before me, said this 
Jambala II looks great, and I found out that he is right.
Just like Wings of Death, these new games are super. I didn't 
like playing the old stuff from Thalion, but these are really worth 
having in your collection.
For now, I am bored. You will also be bored, if you read the 
article of the next guy, whoever it is.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Friday 15.06.1990, 01:19:23 a.m.
SLIME and NEW MODE typing bullshit and some sarcastic comments

We've just seen a preview of a game called 'Sagrotan' (or 
something like that - I'm not sure! - hohoho!!). The graphix are 
really pretty nice BUT the style of coding is soooo lame that WE 
can't imagine - one bug hunts the other! It should be better 
named as 'BUGrotan'! At the moment DARYL makes a little craptalk 
with NEW MODE and is going now in the kitchen to take a snack.
We have installed some 'Mousetraps' in the sleeping-bags of our 
visitors - we will see (or feel??) how they like them.
END of shitty craptalk - it's now 01:35:31 a.m.

p.s.: After we seen some Amiga-demos, we feel so sick that we 
      have to go to bed now. It's 01:52:24 a.m.
p.p.s: NEW MODE and QUESTLORD have a little disscussion with no
       result........(really lame).It's now 01:59:02 a.m.
       
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                          GOOD MORNIG !

It's now the 15th of June(a friday) and it's about half eight in 
the mornig. Here is CHRIS of TGE on the keyboard. Everybody 
arround me is still sleeping or snorring(Ford Perfect for example 
who slept next to me). I've just opened the window in front of me 
to get some fresh air - hey I'll describe you this wonderful 
view: first all is very green and all is very silent, you can't 
hear any sounds of civilasation exept me typing on this keyboard. 
The dominant sounds here are the singing of birds ... and the 
snorring of some guys here, it's wonderful! You can also see the 
cows(look further up!) and a small asphalt narrow leading up to 
the hill. I don't know exactly where we are but it's a really 
nice place and imagine, we have no phone here! Oh, the Church 
bell just hits eight times. This evening we go grilling and I 
think that we all will be drunk, coz we have much alcoholic 
stuff left, like five liters of good german beer(FÅrstenberg 
Pilsner, eines der besten Biere der Welt!), lotsa Tequilla, and, 
and, and...Let's talk about the crasiest workstation here, it 
belongs to -me- of TEX and it consists of three(3!) harddisks two 
monitors and even two mice(for each hand one!), and of course a 
Mega ST. So, what's next? Yes, now I'll send my best greeting I 
have to my girlfriend called Almut!
Let's talk again about this *party* here. So for it was really 
funny, we also got enough to eat so far(we had our(-me- of TEX,
,CHRIS(that's me!),Michael of TEX, Axe of Delight, Chaos Inc.) 
last snak about two o'clock in the morning we ate some strange 
stuff, we call it 'Gullasch'. I'm really looking forward to this 
afternoon getting another kind of food to distinguish my 
hunger(of love!?!) It's nearly half nine and I'm still the one 
and only here who's already awake. But some of them also have to 
refull their energy because today starts the demo competition. I 
can tell you the things I know so far: you have to write a 
demoscreen in 24 hours without using any sources. You must write 
all sources here, the graphixx must also be done here, for the 
sound you can use some Hippel-sounds. I don't know if I will take 
part in this competition coz I should rather finish my screens 
for the Alliance Demo III. There'll be also a meeting in june, 
somewhere a bit more in the north, FP told me that it will last 
also four days but I'm really looking forward to see all the 
other Alliance guys(The Garlic Eaters are in the Alliance now, 
too) especially Bloody Murray of BMT(Hey Thomas, echt scheiûe, 
daû Du nicht hier bist!) and to Ti Eytsch of Newline(hope it's 
the right name),(Hey Thorsten, na wie geht's wie steht's!).
Yesterday, no excuse me it was this morning, we(me and Michael of 
TEX) tried to make Snake of the replicants to drink some good 
german beer, first he refused but then he drunk it and we'll see 
if he's got a headache today(if you know what I mean!) I'll just 
going to put on some new cloths, see ya........ I just washed 
myself and it was horrible it gives only cold water in this oase 
of wilderness.

Friday 15-06-90        Time: 9:12

Hello, this is (or in some cases will be) BLUE DEVIL of the
GIGABYTE-CREW. I am still quite tired but anyway I will write
some shit. It is now a very long time ago since the last GIGABYTE
production was released. The reason is that Marc and me are 
producing games, LOB is finishing university and OLI moved
far away from us. But I will code a little screen for this 24-
hours-demo-competition unless I have little chances of winning
because of NIC of TCB and all the other good guys. It will be
fun anyway. 

Now there are again some people around me, coming back from 
sleep. Well, here I saw a demo which is coded in pure GFA-BASIC.
I can hardly believe that it is BASIC, but we surely will analyse
it. By the way, the demo is not totally bad. (which actually 
means that it is quite good) If it is BASIC, they must have
BMOVEd a lot, but I do not know how they made their 2-plane 
stuff. I am sure that DPOKE, LPOKE, CARD, WORD and company are
too slow, and PUT AND GET are 4-plane and real-shifting.
I think I will go and debug it a bit. See you later.

uuuuaaaahhhh.... who dares to wake me up??? 
(it was 4:00 in the morning when we went to bed, AXE and me (ME))
...but that is correct... this is a very nice place... the early
mentioned cow was just chasing a cat... funny...
But some corrections about my equipment: Of course I have only 
ONE mouse... the other one is from the amiga... and the 'second' 
monitor is DARYLS' monitor...
...but now lets go to the bathroom...

06/15/90            10:34

And once again the Chaos rules... The first coffee we tried to 
make in the morning was just bad. The thing called 'coffee' was 
just hot water with some brown color. BUT the second coffee was 
not bad, because we now know how to make the coffee the way it 
should be made.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Slime again at 11:40 a.m.

Before five minutes I had to hammer a package of 'Calgon' (it's 
stuff for the dishwasher) because it had became wet - that means:
It was so hard that you can kill a person by throwing it at his 
head!!!
What do the other guys I hear you ask.....
Well, SNAKE is hacking around while AXE, CHRIS and some other 
freaks sitting around. CHAOS, INC. on my left tries to cut some 
crap-ix with NEO v.2.0 - but without success!
The guys of 42-CREW playing on the PC-engine, -ME- is 
programming, the other are hanging around in the house and are 
very lazy!!!
It's now 11:51 a.m.

Yoooooooohooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just played about 20 years Sim-City ..... finally another game 
you can start playing without any end in sight. (Hallo Holger,
das ist was fÅr dich !!!)

By the way, I have to sent many greetings to all guys hacking 
in bbs networks, especially MagicNet and Zerberus; for those
of you still looking for the ultimate terminal-program: Upload
RUFUS (hello M_Bernards !!!) from your local mailbox, it's really
great; full VT100, Z-Modem, Batches, everything you need for long
phone sessions (get lost, $chwarz-$chilling!!!)

13:50:?? CHRIS of TGE

You won't belive it. I was just writing the readme file for 
NEOchrome Master, when my Mega ST2 decided to make a journey in 
the endless narrows of the darkest Nirwana. I hate it, I hate it. 
Fuck it!!!! Now I think I'll rewrite the last few lines...

14:01:55                 Axe of Delight

What is that? A lonely computer? Standing here and waiting for 
somebody to sit down and write something?
Snake and Cobra of the Replicunts eh Replicants have left the 
house and are (together with Delta Force) at the train station to 
fetch another member of the Replicants (Maxi, I think). Yesterday 
we found out that nobody has written anything about the food yet, 
so I will. There was a soup which was very good. The only thing 
was that you could breathe fire after you had eaten it. Then at 
late night it was time for our midnight snack. It was very funny 
to sit there while the first guys had gone to sleep. Actually 
most of the freaks were snoring upstairs at that time.
I didn't sleep very well. I fell asleep after 4 o'clock and at 
9:30 I was woken up by talking and so I got up from the hard 
floor.
Now I have to get back to work: I will do the PQ2 pack. Bye, for 
now.
------------------------------------------------------------------
14:30:?? CHRIS of TGE

Guess it! All files are totally fucked. So, you won't get a 
readme file for NEOchrome Master, not today!!!
I could kill Mike Bees!!!
                                   Bye, CHRIS
------------------------------------------------------------------
15:18 New Mode

The demo-competition has started now. Six groups are beginning to 
code their screens. Tomorrow it's finished. You can't use any 
prewritten sourcecodes or graphixx. Everything you do has to be 
done in 24 hours (just one font and one logo is allowed). 
Tomorrow at 18 o'clock the lucky winner will get his award (wait 
how it looks like!).
Bye for now, I have to begin coding a screen (together with Axe 
of Delight, we'll try to do a nice screen.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SLIME 15:36

As a painter i havn't much to do in the demo-competition (i hope 
so...). 
Now the lunch is ready (24 pieces of garlic sausages) and i'm a
'little bittle' hungry. Mampf!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
16:36  FPuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhh/BMT

Just ate one of the above mentioned sausages:  Ufffffffffffffffff
48 are left .....  Perhaps you can image the Delta Force guys 
eating sausages for weeks and weeks ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

06/15/90    17:56

Once again it's Chaos, Inc. of the Delta Force who tries to write 
something about this paaarty.
Slime means that I'm a lazy bug, but I think he isn't saying the 
truth. In fact it's a total hammer (please excuse my pigeon 
english) that's Slime saying such things to me! Remember he's a 
painter and I'm a coder. But I decided to improve NEOchrome, a 
painting program. This means, that he's much more profiting from 
this work than myself. And all this for 2 and a half month of 
writing thousands of comments to reassembled NEOchrome.
But now it's really enough.

Hmmmm, messages are getting shorter and shorter; perhaps we 
should introduce some [Floskeln] to mark that someone sat in
front of this useless STE watching two Replicants playing 
Tennis Cup ...

06:35 Level 16

Hi here is Andreas from LEVEL 16. I've nearly finished my part to 
the demo of TEX. It is a program generating code for faster 
shapes. Because I'm programming since 23 hours I'm really very 
tired. So please excuse that my text is not a long one.
------------------------------------------------------------------
june 16, 06:58

Good morning, world!

Yes, I have to sent some greetings out to the world, or better, the
brave one out there (knock knock, still there ?) who read that lottsa
bullshit. Actually 10 pages of none-of-interest-craptalk ...
But after all (Have you _EVER_ seen a guy programming a sync-scroller
during half an hour plus some minutes longer for some kinda vector
graphix (a dancing 3D-cube with filled polygons). Some hours ago 
something like a synchronized text scroller appeared on Nick's screen,
don't know how far it is ready or not ...
Manikin: You will probably _NEVER_ see such kinda coding !!!
Yep, TCB are the best !!!  (no censoring, please !!!)

Just in this moment Andreas/Level 16 jumped at some woodwork 
going through the room. Similarities to monkeys are not 
explicitely mentioned here, this just normal after sitting the
entire night.

During this night, you (naaah, you not, we ...) were able to 
watch the Replicants try to crack Dragonflight (really funny to
look at -ME-'s smiling face and the same time at Snake's and 
Maxi's terrifying one ...); then we learned that some guys in
Bielefeld have done a nice demo for the STe (hello Arne & Alexander !);
you could have admired NeoChrome V2 in fully action (I love those 
guys sitting in front of the monitor, having some 1-plane-
outline-stuff on screen and filling them with beautiful 
colors & shapes of all kind  (ok, they're limited to 512 different 
ones+shading+dithering+interlace++++)); ahh ya, finally my scroller
and my equalizer decided to work like I expected them to do,
Blue Devil has some problems with his text display ...

Hello, here is Howdy of the MCA writing some shitty things.
It's 7.45 in the morning and the guys from TEX, Level 16, BMT,
TCB and Gigabyte Crew are coding their screens for the ICC
(International Coding Conference) Demo. All the guys of
the Replicants are drunken and sleep. The other guys do the same.   
Oh, at this moment blue devil of the gigabyte crew solved all
problems with his screen, it run. Ford Perfect of BMT open      
a window of the house where the ICC takes place and look at
the nice cows outside.
Oooohhh...I'm so tired, I have to stop now to write shitty things.

Good morning, guys!!!!
I just got up after trying to sleep. My sleep was interrupted all 
the time by the loud voices (Erik!!). If just all programmers 
were like Nick who silently types stuff into the keyboard without 
any break...
Now where's our screen for the demo? I don't know!!
Maybe New Mode has done something. I haven't. But I don't think 
that he did something, because yesterday - when we were pumping 
away the beer - we said "Fuck the demo! Forget it!". Maybe I will 
do something for the demo and finally get a nice little screen 
ready.
I like sleeping more than programming. How about you?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
8:51:??    CHRIS of TGE

Hey, how have you slept? I went to bed about two o'clock in the 
morning to ley myself down a bit but fast slept deeper, deeper, 
... When I woke up this morning -es- of TEX was drawing some nice 
graphixx(as always!!!) but at the moment he's hitting Andreas of 
Level 16 coz he "Kann nicht weiter als bis zu seiner Nasenspitze 
denken", Zitat Erik. I don't know if you know that 42-Crew left 
us yersterday, so there are no more Pc-Engine sounds. At the 
moment Samplemaster of TNT woke up and sitts now straight in 
front of his computer gaming some shitty games. Today I'll try to 
rewrite the readme file for NEOchrome Master. So far, I'll go 
back coding now...

UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 09:09
Here's New Mode back again on the scene. Yesterday I got totally 
pissed. I slept from 2 o'clock until now. I was so drunken that I 
wasn't able to code a screen for the competition. But that's 
really no fault coz' nobody has a chance against Nick or TEX. 
Sorry but true. Perhaps I will start to code a little 
vectorballs-scroller but I heard that Axe hasn't coded one byte 
since yesterday. Six hours and the competition is over.

Yawn! I'm too tired and lazy to write a lot now - maybe in two 
hours........ .  .   .     .

Another competition has started now. This time it's a "triathlon-
competition". You have to play table-tennis, midimaze and an 
amiga shoot-em'up game called "battle squadron" (you might 
remember the game that Slime played for hours and hours). Three 
hours and 20 minutes left for the demo-competition. Some screens 
are ready.

Hello! Long time no hear.
We just returned from a great eating orgie. It was a lot and we 
are all stuffed. The demo competition is delayed by this 
unavoidable act of eating. Maybe I will get a little screen 
ready. Let's see.

Attention! I just got a very interresting information from New 
Mode. Last night, some french guys were totally pissed and in 
their funny mood, they destroyed a mailbox of the post. So we 
have to count with a visit of the local police. We decided to 
close the door to the roof and we'll sitt in the garden, imagine 
all the guys sitting in a circle and doing joga. I just got 
another information. Last night, our neighbours also called the 
police two times, also in case of some frenchies...

Snake of the Replicants at 2.20

We are not very proud of this destruction in the village but you
know after a lot of beer and tequila a lot of guy were not really 
ok. I hope that the german guy won't have a bad opinion about us
ok so the party can go on. We are now 6 french because tsunoo 
join the party this morning.. Ok so see you later.
PS: We have learn to Howdy of the Mca a great sentence (hehehe 
great one)
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This is Chaos, Inc. one of these guys who 'throw' this party...

Well, not bad the things, that happened last night.... I do hope 
that there will be no similiar action today night. Otherwise all 
the guys who are still there will be get big trouble, because 
maybe there will be an police officer to visit us and ask us what 
we're doing...... (It's not a good joke to ask a cracker what he 
does, if this question is asked by an police officer).....

But I except the apologize of Snake, although I think, that he's 
NOT the guy who made this destruction.

Well let's hope the best for tonight...And may the Schwartz be 
with you and all the guys of this party especially with the 
french guys...

Now nearly all teams had played 'Battle Squadron' and it seems, 
that Cobra and Killersoft made it in this part of the competition 
and New Mode and I have reached the 2nd place (we'll have reached 
surley the 1st place if New Mode didn't play sooo lame - nasty 
guy!).
Yesterday in the late afternoon Chaos, Inc. had kicked me in the 
garden and told me that I have to mow it with a hover, otherwise 
he won't let me gamble 'S(l)im(e)-city' anymore...... so I mow that 
fucking garden (it was a funny work, 'cause I mowed a 'I.C.C.-logo' 
in it - hahaha!).

YEAH! My screen is almost ready, only some faulty raster routine
makes some trouble (when switching on the lower border ...) ...
got to be fixed by now (or at least today ...)
