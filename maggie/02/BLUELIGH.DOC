--------------
Review of BLUE LIGHTNING for the Atari LYNX by Andrew Webb (ZOGG 
of The Watchmen)

After  an impressive credits screen,  Blue Lightning puts you  in 
the pilot seat of a fighter plane.  The aim of each of the levels 
varies,  the  first  is  a straight  dogfight,  which  pits  your 
fighting abilities against that of the machine.  The view of  the 
action is a 3D-behind-the-plane type,  Taking off from your  base 
you fly for a short time over a desert-like terrian,  the  action 
then moves onto a grass plain type terrian,  over which you  meet 
the  first  of the enemy fighters.  After waiting for  the  small 
square to lock in on a enemy plane you unleash a stream of cannon 
fire  and  watch as it explodes into a thousand  tiny  fragments. 
Flying along railway,  rivers, forest and hills past beneath you, 
but  admiring  the scenery can be bad for your  health,  as  more 
fighter planes appear intent on your demise.  On some levels  you 
need to destroy ground targets,  these can usually be knocked out 
with  either some carefully aimed cannon fire,  or by the  easier 
missile  method.  The  sound in the game  is  good,  the  opening 
credits are backed by a fairly nice bit of music (although it  is 
slightly  drowned out by the lightning sounds).  In game  effects 
are  the  normal sort for a flight  game  (missiles,  explosions, 
engines  etc)  and a fairly realistic.  The graphics  are  nicely 
drawn, and attention to detail is excellent.

The action and speed of the game is incredibly fast,  good use is 
made of the LYNX's hardware scaling feature.  All the scenery and 
enemy plane zoom towards you nicely.  The ground below is covered 
in trees,  hills,  buildings etc,  which grow smoothly in size as 
you approach them.

A  nice feature of the game is the password system (at the  start 
of every level you are given a password, entering it at the start 
of  the game will transport you back to that level) this no  only 
stops the boredom of having to recomplete lower levels,  it  also 
saves on the batteries!  Over all,  It is a wonderful game,  well 
worth œ20 of anyones money.  If you're looking for a fast  "After 
Burner" type game, then this is it.
