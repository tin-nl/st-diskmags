
NORTH AND SOUTH BY BEN DOLLEY

   Oh dear,the mag is coming out in only 2 weeks and i  have  not 
done a single review.Well i thought to myself one day if i  don`t 
do  any  reviews  a certain nextdoor neighbour  would  be  rather 
cross.So with a sudden urge i decided to get of my back side  and 
review the brilliant game North And South.Well off we go...

  In the year 1861 America was under attack!The attack came  from 
the south and they were led by the brilliant general Lee who  was 
one  mean bastard.Luckily in those days they didn`t have  nuclear 
weapons,tanks  or  the  game wouldn`t last very  long  1  nuclear 
missile and there all dead.All they were armed with were infantry 
with  rifles  that back fired so often that they killed  more  of 
there own men than that of the enemy.Cavalry that were armed with 
swords or other weapons and unreliable cannons that if aimed  and 
fired correctly usually have devastating effect.
   So  it was time for the commander of America`s  armies  to  do 
something.He decided to  send some  armies to search and  destroy
the enemy.

   North  And  South is a tactical shoot them  up  game.The  main 
objective is to conquer states and destroy the enemies armies.The 
game  takes  place  on a screen sized map  of  America  which  is 
separated  into  different  states.You armies  can  be  moved  to 
different states for tactical advantage.
    At  the  beginning  you  have  a  screen  full  of  different 
options.You  can chose to play against the computer or  a  friend 
which  means your friend can play against you and you have a  two 
player  battle(battles  will be explained later so  please  don`t 
worry).You  can  chose  to have Indians which mean  if  you  stay 
outside  the railway line on the west side for a about  3  rounds 
the   Indians  come  and  destroy  most  or  all  of  your   army 
automatically.

   This review is starting to piss me off when i read it  all  it 
seems  to be is a jumbled piece of shit,however i suppose i  must 
continue so off we go once more.

   You  can have the  weather option  which hinders  your  armies 
movements.Also you can have boats which if you own the port gives 
you another army which is useful.
   Depending on what year you chose you have a varying amount  of 
armies  and army sizes.In 1861 for instance the goodies  in  blue 
only  have two states which the normal size armies  6  infantry,3 
cavalry  and  1 cannon.The badies in brown have the  same.On  the 
other  hand in 1862 the goodies have 3 basic armies  whereas  the 
badies  have 2 armies of 9 infantry,5 cavalry and 2  cannons  and 
one army of 9,3 and 1.You can join armies up to a maximum of 18,9 
and 3 which is pretty awesome.
    The train line is an easy way of getting new armies once  you 
own all the states around the line the train starts puffing along 
at  the end of your turn.The more states you own the  more  money 
you earn,if you manage to accumulate 5 bags of gold you are given 
a  basic army to put where there are states filled with  flashing 
white.The average amount of gold per train is 3.If you manage  to 
own  an enemy state which has the train line passing through  you 
can  intercept  the enemy`s train which takes place  in  in  neat 
scene which you have to reach the front of the train in a certain 
time.However there is a problem the enemy has a limited amount of 
men  to stop each is armed with a throwing knife these  slow  you 
down,but  can not kill you.You however are armed with  4  daggers 
when you have used them you only have punches left.If you capture 
the train you get the enemies gold.
  
    Now it is time to explain the battle sequence which may  take 
along  time.When you decide to try and kill the enemy`s army  the 
amount of troops etc.  can be seen by moving the mouse pointer to 
the respective army.Once you move to the enemies state you  watch 
a  cartoon  style picture of a cannon ball  being  fired  between 
armies.The  battles  are in cartoon style  with  three  different 
battle  fields  the Grand Canyon,open battle field  and  a  river 
scene.
    The maximum amounts of men you can have on at one time are  6 
men which are placed 3 wide and 2 long,3 cavalry and 3 cannons.If 
you have more than the maximum they will come on as when the ones 
on  the  screen die.Cannon ball shot lengths  are  determined  by 
holding  down the fire button.They are best for mass  troop  wipe 
out.They  can fire 9 shots then are wheeled off.The  cavalry  are 
best  if used well for troop wipe out and for nailing cannons  as 
they can move about 3 times as fast as the infantry.The  infantry 
are good all rounders.   
    One  more point is that you have a certain  amount  of  forts 
which  are placed where there is a railway station.These  can  be 
captured  like the trains and thus cut of the enemy from  letting 
there trains deliver money.
    On completing the game there is a superb end screen  which  i 
shall  not describe as it might spoil the fun out  of  completing 
it,so there!

 EFFECTS

   The graphics are superb the battle scenes are  very,very  good 
and  are  very  put into cartoon  style.The  other  graphics  are 
brilliantly well drawn.The end scene is very funny and looks very 
good.The sound is also very good,but it is the graphics that make 
the game special.
