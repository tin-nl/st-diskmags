                        Byte - Bending

                By Christophe of The Watchmen


     And lo, the mighty   Lost    Boys came upon the Earth and 
didst slay all her tiny and unintelligent life forms. From the 
dust and the debris arose a young coder.  He had the face of a 
golden fish, the body of a tank, and the nob of a rhinocerous.

     He  pulled  from under his belt a small square  of  blue, 
inscribed  with  the immortal words "Hisoft DevpacST  for  the 
Atari ST."

     A bolt of lightning split into two and by his sides  soon 
stood  the  two  other immortals who were to  follow  him  and 
respect him.  One was gifted with the ability to draw Smileys, 
and the other couldst Easily destroy an enemy's mind,  with  a 
short  burst  of his killer "Sale Of  The  Centuary  (Nicholas 
BLOODY Parsons!) musak."

     The three were soon to become known as The Watchmen,  and 
their  wild and crazy antics were to become heard of  far  and 
wide.

     One fine day,  a bunch of dirty crackers called New Order 
dared to slag off The Watchmen's Byte - Bender, saying that it 
was far too slow and complex.

      But deep inside those bad people  knew that they were in
fact a load of utter shite,  and The Watchmen had the  fastest 
code  on the machine that was the fabled Atari ST.  They  knew 
that  they  must  get  their  dirty  little  mits  upon  their 
adversaries' positively sexual source code.

  So here it is! Especially for Our Good Buddies New Order.


     If you have ever seen our DEF CON ONE demo (Why not?) you 
would  have  been stunned by the incredible  3  bitplane  byte 
bender which scrolled smoothly along on the title screen.

     The way it works is incredible complex, and is beyond the 
scope  of  this  magazine - so bugger off  you  smarmy  little 
farts.



       Oh, all right then, I'll attempt to explain it.


     Firstly,  the  actual text (you know,  the bit  that  you 
type) is converted to a form that can be used by the demo. Its 
not  really that difficult to understand,  so I'll tell you  a 
bit about it.  Firstly,  any punctuation is checked  for,  and 
changed  to  fit the font.  The punctation  and  numbers  come 
towards the end of the font,  and so it has to be frigged with 
so that the program can find it.

     After  that,  the number $41 (the Ascii code for "A")  is 
subtracted from the whole font, and thats that.

     All this bollocks is done before the program is saved  to 
the disk (ie I've got the program and you haven't) so you will 
have to code your own little routine to do this.

                      Inside the demo code...

     The  source  code and all the accompanying stuff  can  be 
found in the "BYTEBEND.TWM" folder,  and needs to be taken out 
of whatever other folders it's in.

     This is where it starts to get really manic.  The font is 
first  rearranged into little strips of 8 pixels or  1  byte's 
width  (Byte  Bender  - geddit?) and sorted  around  till  the 
program is happy with what it's done.  After that, the text is 
converted  again  (!) to the absolute address of  each  strip. 
This means that each byte of text goes to 4 longwords of  text 
table.  This  is  fine until you realise that a 2k  text  file 
becomes 32k long after this bit. And you wondered why the text 
on the DEF CON ONE loader was short!

     The  program then buggers the colours and screen about  a 
bit,  and sets up a vbl system interrupt to do the  scrolling, 
and colour splits.

              Here comes the boring bit to code.     

     A  total  of 40 seperate routines (320/8) are  needed  to 
draw the characters. It reads the y position out of the table, 
and adds it to the screen position,  and then leaps off to yet 
another  routine  which  actually draws  the  graphic  to  the 
screen, and then back for the next 8 pixel strip.

     After all 40 strips are done,  the text and ypos pointers 
are incremented, and then the interrupt exits and gets on with 
loading the demo.



     I  would just like to point out I don't really think  New 
Order are crap.  (Thanks for the Limited Edition Disk you gave 
us at the Atari 90's show lads!)
