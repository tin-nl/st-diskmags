
	AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CAREBEARS

First of all before you read the actual interview, I would like
to say a mega thanks to Tanis for returning the disks so quickly
so that I could fit them in this Issue. MEGA THANKS and keep up 
the very very good work. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU IN
MARSEILLE IN THE SUMMER !!!! By the way Tanis, you appear to be 
the only guy in the Carebears with a decent musix taste. I usually 
go to sleep with SLAYER, SEPULTRA AND THAT KINDS OF STUFF, so 
thanks again and I hope that you will enjoy this article....

		  THEY ARE TRULY SORRY THAT WE'LL STOP CODING. SO
		  WE WILL (!!!!) MAKE ANOTHER DEMO. THOU WHO HAVE
		  READ THE FIRST ISSUE OF LOST BOYS MAGGIE KNOW

		  MINDBOMB. JUST WAIT AND THOU WILL SEE....
                  
                  
		PS: WE JUST HEARD THAT YOU (LOST BOYS) HAVE MADE 
		  A 3D VECTOR SCREEN, AND IF YOUR ROUTINES HAPPEN
		  TO BE NEARLY AS FAST AS OUR, THEN REMEBER THAT
		  WE WERE THE FIRST. OUR ROUTINES ARE MORE THAN TWICE
		  AS FAST THAN THE FASTEST 3D VECTOR GAME ON THE ST
		  SO FAR, (AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE PREVIEW OF 
		  NO SECOND PRICE) DEVELOPED TOGETHER WITH CHRIS
		  JUNGEN (TNT)

HABITS:            BURPING OUT LOUD...
		   ORDERING IN TOO MUCH FOOD WHEN I'M AT BURGER KING.
		   SLEEPING TO MUCH.

		     MORNING).
		   GETTING STUCK IN FRONT OF THE TV-SET.
			
FAVE SAYING:  1. POOF!
	      2. IF YOU EVER EAT A KEBAB YOU WILL SLOWLY BE
		   MUTILATED TO A PRESPIRING, ASS ITCHING FAN BELT...   

FAVE JOKE:    Q. WHEN DOES A BLIND MAN TAKING SKY DIVING LESSONS
		   KNOW WHEN HE IS NEAR THE GROUND?
                  
	      A. WHEN HIS GUIDE DOG LEASH GOES SLACK...

CLOTHES:         MOSTLY BLACK PANTS AND EITHER A CARCASS, SLAYER
		   OR BATHORY T-SHIRT. SOMETIMES OUR TCB CREW JACKET.

FAVE COLOR:        BLACK 
                 
MUSIC TASTES:    CARCASS, BATHORY, AFFLICTED CONVULSION, PARADISE LOST,
	    	   MACABRE, NAPALM DEATH, SEPULTURA, GENERAL SURGERY,
		   ENTOMBED, DISMEMBER AND UNLEASHED. BUT WHEN I WANT TO
		   LISTEN TO SOMETHING WHILE I GO TO SLEEP I LISTEN MOSTLY
		   TO SOFTER MUSIC LIKE SLAYER, VOIVOD, METALLICA, KREATOR,
		   TERRORIZER, MORBID ANGEL, OLD TESTAMENT (THEIR NEW STYLE
		   SUCKS!), TANGERINE DREAM, J.M JARRE, BACH, BEETHOVEN, 
		   MADNESS AND KATE BUSH (SHE IS TOTALLY BRILLIANT...).

		   GRINDCORE FROM STOCKHOLM... 

FAVE SONG:       THE SUCCULENT AFTERMATH OF A SUBDURAL HAEMORRAGE..

		   MEMORIZE THEN MASTRUBATE, BLOODY, SOAKED AND RAVAGED
		   I SCOOP YOU INTO BAGS, A REEKING PILE OF GARBAGE...)
		 (DEEP LYRICS, DON'T YOU THINK. GENERAL SURGERY IS
		   REALLY A GREAT BAND...). I ALSO THINK THAT THE
		   SONG 'EMPATHOLOGICAL NECROTISM' BY CARCASS IS A QUITE
		   GOOD ONE AS WELL NOT TO MENTION ANGEL OF DEATH WITH
		   SLAYER (FROM THEIR ALBUM REIGN IN BLOOD).

HOBBIES:         I DRAW. 
		 PLAY THE GURA.
		 WATCH TOO MUCH TV.

		 BURPING COMPETITION WITH MICHAEL BITTNER AND RICHIE
		   KARSMAKERS. I GUESS RICHARD IS IN THE LEAD, BUT I
		   THINK THAT BITTNER AND I ARE QUITE EQUAL IN TALENT.
		 SEE HOW LONG I CAN WORK FURIOUSLY BEFORE I FAINT OR
		   THROWS UP...
		 I READ A HELL OF A LOT OF COMICS. I GUESS I BUY ALL THE
		   SWEDISH ONES THAT ARE WORTH READING. AND I ALSO BUY 
		   AMERICAN ONES LIKE THE PUNISHER, JUDGE DREDD, ELF
		   QUEST AND ANYTHING I CAN GET HOLD OF THAT'S DRAWN
		   BY RICHARD CORBEN. I ALSO LIKE THE COMIC 'CHEECH
		   WIZARD'. TOO BAD THE AUTHOR IS DEAD, SO I GUESS I
		   HAVE TO READ OLD ISSUES NOW.

FAVE FOOD:       TACOS, HAMBURGER OR ANYTHING I CAN GET MY HANDS ON...
		   (NOT KEBAB THOUGH.)

FAVE DRINKS:     SPIETZIE (I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPELL IT.). IT'S

		   AS HELP FOR KEEPING DOORS OPEN, ST, AMIGA

FAVE TV PROG:    THE YOUNG ONES. TOO BAD IT IS NO LONGER. SO NOW I
		   GUESS COMIC STRIP TAKES THE LEAD... BUT BLACK ADDER
		   IS NOT FAR BEHIND.
                  
WORST TV PROG:   I GUESS I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MANIKIN WHEN HE THINKS
		   EMMERDALE FARM IS THE WORST PROGRAM... BUT I THINK
		   THAT 'THE MOVIE GAME' ISN'T TOO GOOD EITHER.

BEST FILM:       DEFINATELY 'THE DARK CRYSTAL', EVIL DEAD II, TERMINATOR,
		   HIGHLANDER, TOP SECRET, CLIFF 'EM ALL, HELLBOUND,
		   MRS BRISBY AND THE SECRET OF NIMH. LOTS OF SHIT
		   ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH I THINK THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN
		   A GOOD MOVIE IN QUITE A WHILE...
                  
WORST FILM:      TERRORVISION, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST,SUPERMAN IV, HERCULES,

		   DON'T REMEMBER 'EM AT THE MOMENT...

BEST NIGHT OUT:  DON'T KNOW. DON'T GO OUT MUCH, ACTUALLY.. 

BEST CONCERT:    DEFINATLLY METALLICA AT SOLNAHALLEN IN STOCKHOLM.
	  	   IT WAS A TOTAL MINDBOMB...

FAVE SIGN:       THE SLAYER (NOT COMPLETED) PENTAGRAM. 

FAVE GAME:       JETSET WILLY, MANIC MINER, SPHERICAL (HEY MUTSCHIE,
		   I'M TALKING ABOUT THY GAME), GUNFRIGHT, KNIGHT LORE,
		   UNDERWURLDE, SHADOW OF THE BEAST. AND OF COURSE
		   THE SIERRA ON LINE GAMES (GREAT CONCEPTS. IT'S A
		   SHIT THAT THEY CAN'T DO ANY GOOD CONCEPTS NOWDAYS,
		   DON'T YOU AGREE? 

WORST GAME:      MOST OF THE ST-GAMES. IT'S REALLY A FIX THAT THEY
		   CAN'T DO ANY GOOD GAMES NOWDAYS. NO WONDER PEOPLE
		   TAKE TO THE CRACKING MARKET... I MEAN WHO FEELS
		   LIKE PAYING 20-30 POUNDS FOR A GAME THAT'S TRASH
		   WHEN YOU CAN GET THEM FOR NOTHING IF YOU HAVE
		   THE RIGHT CONTACTS. IF I FIND I GAME THAT I LIKE
		   ON A CD, FOR INSTANCE, I GO AND BUY IT ON ORIGINAL
		   AFTERWARDS. 

FAVE VIRUS:      THE 24-HOUR SCHOOL VIRUS. (HITS ME ALL THE TIME)

FAVE DEMO CREW:  STRANGE QUESTION. I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNEW THAT 
		   THE UNBEATABLE CAREBEARS ARE AND WILL REMAIN THE
		   ONE AND ONLY BEST CREW. BUT LOST BOYS TAKE A WORTHY
		   SECOND PLACE.. FURTHER MORE I THINK THAT THE EXCEPTIONS
		   TAKE THE THIRD PLACE AND THE FOURTH IS STOLEN BY 
		   MICHAEL BITTNER (OF TNT-CREW). NR FIVE IS IN POSSESION
		   OF CHRIS JUNGEN (TNT).....   I COULD WRITE MORE
		   BUT I GUESS THAT YOU AREN'T TOO INTERESTED...

WORST DEMO CREW: THE LIGHT TEAM, THE KNIGHT TEAM, SPHERE (THE 
		   UNDESCRIBABLE LAMERS FROM RONNINGE (SUBURB TO 
		   STOCKHOLM))(THERE ARE TOO MANY GROUPS THAT JUST
		   OUGHT TO GO AWAY BUT ARE TOO STUPID TO DO SO),
		   AND UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THEM LIVES IN SWEDEN.

BEST DEMO:       FOR THE MOMENT I'M NOT SURE, BUT I THINK THAT
		   THERE WERE MORE FEELING IN THE CUDDLY DEMOS, AND
		   IT WAS MORE REVOLUTIONARY THAN MIND BOMB. BUT WHEN
		   WE COME OUT WITH OUR NEW DEMO. IT WILL BE NO QUESTION
	  	   WHATSOEVER ABOUT WHICH DEMO IT IS THAT RULES.. 

WORST THOUGHT:   I DON'T KNOW REALLY. I DON'T THINK MUCH...
      		   OR PERHAPS I THINK TOO MUCH AND GETS TO THE CONCLUSION 
		   THAT EVERYTHING IS A MESS...
           
SPECIAL NOTE OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY:
                  
		 I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT WE HAVE GOT A NEW, AND
		   FINAL, MEMBER IN THE CAREBEARS. HIS NAME IS GOGO 
		   BUT HIS REAL NAME IS THORSTEN MUTSCHALL (YES, FROM 
		   SPEHRICAL) AND I THINK THAT HE'S THE SECOND BEST 
		   ARTIST AFTER MARK COLEMAN (XENON 2, CADAVER) ON THE ST.
		   SO HE'LL BE A GREAT STAND IN WHEN I DON'T HAVE THE 
		   ENERGY TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF... BUT IT WILL TAKE 
		   A WHILE BEFORE MY ENERGY RUNS OUT...

                 FURTHER MORE I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE MY PERSONAL
		   REGARDS TO THE SHEPHERD WHO MANAGED TO PICK UP
		   THE FISHING ROD I USED FOR CAMOFLAGE... THANKS..
