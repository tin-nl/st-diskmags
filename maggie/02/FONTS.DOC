Designing  fonts is quite a hard task if you have never tride  it 
before, the first thing you have to do is find a few letters of a 
font you like e.g.  THE MEGADETH FONT on mind bomb, for this font 
I only had the letters present in the word MEGADETH to copy from.
what  you do is pick out the main features of those  few  letters 
and  use them where you can in other letters,  like the 'A'  this 
can  be use to make a 'V' and the pointy bits on the 'G' and  'E' 
can be used to make the 'F',  'L',  'Q',  'Z' and 'C'. The 'F' is 
easy  to make if you only have the 'E' because you only  need  to 
cut the foot off.


                     ******          ******
                     *               *
                     ****     TO     ****        
                     *               *
                     ******          *


For  the  ARISTA  font ,also used in mind  bomb,  it  was  easier 
because  the  album  I got the font from had  used  almost  every 
single letter on it anyway.  The font was originaly by one of the 
people who did the box cover pictures for PSYCNOSIS.


You  can also go and a book full of almost every commercial  font 
used  in advertising today.  This is an easy way to find lots  of 
new an interesting fonts without much hard work.


The  easy thing to do is read the article on ripping  fonts  that 
should  be in this issue of MAGGIE, on this disc you will find 
the eight color version of the MEGADETH font from the MINDBOMB 
demo which you can use in your own demos, if you do use it though 
you must credit SPAZ OF THE LOST BOYS for the font. In further 
issues of MAGGIE you will probably find other fonts that we have 
used, so look out for them,.


That's all I have to write about fonts so go and read another 
article.
