PROBABLY THE BEST HANDHELD IN THE WORLD?
----------------------------------------
Review of the Atari LYNX by Andrew Webb (ZOGG of The Watchmen)

After many months of Atari changing prices,  changing  spec,  and 
changing names, the Atari handheld console has finally leapt into 
the sunshine. It's name? The LYNX. 

Housed  inside a dark grey (or black depending on whether it's  a 
USA  version.) box about the size of a video cassette it's  looks 
quite harmless,  but beneath this lies some of the most  advanced 
hardware you'll see in a hand held;

       3.5 inch LCD colour screen
       Resolution of 160 x 102
       Built in speaker
       Jack for headphones
       32 bit audio processor
       4 channel sound
       Hardware scrolling
       Hardware sprite scaling
       6502 microprocessor (16Mhz clock)
       16 on screen colours from 4096
       Cartridge port to take 16MEG cartridges
       Multiple players (eg 1 or more LYNX's playing together!)
       
The  looks of the machine are good,  large screen in the  middle, 
rocker pad on it's left.  Four buttons (Function A and function B 
and  the  same for the left hand mode) are situated  on  the  far 
right of the machine. On either side of the screen are the on/off 
buttons  and  the  option buttons (which also double  up  as  the 
screen flip and reset buttons),  and amazingly a PAUSE button! On 
the  sides  of the machine are the normal sort of  controls  like 
contrast,   brightness,   volume  etc  as  well  as  the  sockets 
(multiplayer and headphones)

One  of the very first things that hits you when you turn it  on, 
is the crystal clear display,  like all LCD screens it does  have 
to  be  seen  at just the right angle (otherwise  it  looks  like 
somebodys just nuked the place) but when it is the quality really 
has to be seen to be believed,  no blurring (which I'm  told,  is 
one of the Nintendo GAMEBOY's bad points) no dodgy colours and  a 
pixel sharp crispness a lot of monitors would be envious  of.  Of 
course a game wouldn't be a game with out some serious sound, and 
this  is taken care of by the 4 channel sound  chip.  The  output 
from  the  built  in speaker is quite good but to  get  the  full 
benifit  I advise you to plug in some headphones (or an amp!)  As 
most  things  on  the LYNX are hardware  (rather  than  software) 
based,  the  games  are hellishly fast (I think even  giving  the 
Amiga  a  run  for it's money) Almost all of the  games  use  the 
hardware sprite scaling,  especially BLUE LIGHTNING (where  large 
canyons hurtle towards you at a frightening speed),  ELECTRO  COP 
(the intro zooms full screen credits and large spaceships towards 
you)  and CALIFORNIA GAMES (when starting the skate  boarding,  a 
distant view of the whole area rapidly zooms in on your man)

A point worth noting is the option to flip the screen  vertically 
through 180 degrees, this allows left and right handed players to 
use the machine easily and comfortably,  a good design feature at 
last!

My only real complaints about the machine are the game cards  and 
the  life  span  of the batteries.  The game cards  are  fine  to 
insert,  but  to remove them you must push down firmly and  pull, 
and  although  it sounds easy,  it's  not.  Removing  them  often 
involves  a struggle and a hard tug-o-war.  Although the LYNX  is 
suppied  with  a mains Adapter,  batteries are  the  most  useful 
method of running the system,  the only problem is that the  LYNX 
eats batteries like no ones business (the battery life is roughly 
about 6 or 7 hours).

At  the minute there are roughly about 6 games out for the  LYNX; 
BLUE  LIGHTNING (An AFTER BURNER type game),  GATES OF  ZENDOCON, 
ELECTRO COP,  CHIPS CHALLENGE, GAUNTLET III, AND RAMPAGE. However 
roumors have it that other great titles  like;  PAPERBOY,  FLYING 
ACE,  APB,  3D BARRAGE,  ROAD BLASTERS,  SUPER SOCCER,  CHEQUERED 
FLAG,  TORNAMENT CYBERBALL,  ZARLOR MERCENARY,  XENOPHOBE,  KLAX, 
VINDICATORS, SLIME WORLD, TURBO-SUB, JUNKYARD DOG and quite a few 
others, are currently being developed.

Having  run down the batteries on Skunk's machine I'm a  hardened 
adict.  If you've got the money,  and like a good game, you can't 
go wrong by buying a LYNX.

The  LYNX costs roughly œ160 and comes with the comms  link  to 
connect  two  LYNX's together,  CALIFORNIA  GAMES,  and  a  power 
adapter (vital!)
       The game cost varies, but is roughly about œ22.

  to kiss?"
