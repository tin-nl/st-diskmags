
                          Hello, guys!


Here I am, DOGUE DE MAUVE from the french crew OVERLANDERS. As I 
found the first MAGGIE issue absolutely great, I decided to make 
my best to help the LOST BOYS in their project. So, I will try to 
write a few articles for the next issues... 
But before that, let me introduce myself, giving you all the 
details you don't care a fig about... 

NAME: DOGUE DE MAUVE

REAL NAME: GUILLAUME LE PENNEC (he just hates his name!)

AGE: 18

SEX: YES

NORMAL STATE: In front of his ST.

HAIR STYLE: Medium-size brown hair.

LOOKS: Pretty common, with a little sword on his vest and another 
around his neck which attract people's attention in subway...

HABITS: Putting his finger in his nose (beurk, nasty!)
        Putting his hand in his hair and looking at the ceiling.
        Speaking with a low, deep, male voice in the phone and 
        with a bad common voice in the street (or anywhere else).


FAVE SAYING: "Hello Starfighter! Are you ready to be scared to death?
              So come and choose your warrior!" (strange mix between
              the IMAGINA 90 show & "BARBARIAN 2" by PALACE SOFTWARE)

FAVE JOKE: "J'ai d‚couvert... en argent!" (stupid french joke)

         colors). Strangely no jeans. Usually, a black vest with 
         the little sword on it and his walkman.

FAVE COLOR: Black (strange for a guy called "DE MAUVE" isn't it?)

MUSIC TASTES: Many different things, usually not in the TOP 50 or 
              any kinda charts (or he liked it before it was in 
              the charts...)
              For instance: METALLICA, GENESIS, PETER GABRIEL, 
              TEARS FOR FEARS, U2, THE POLICE...

FAVE SONG: "San Jacinto" & "Mercy Street" by PETER GABRIEL. 
           Probably two of the most beautiful songs ever performed
           on Earth (it's just my personnal opinion).

HOBBIES: Programming, playing and all ways of using his ATARI ST.
         Playing Role playing games.
         Reading and going to the cinema (fantastic films).

FAVE FOOD: MARS ICE-CREAM (tasty!)

FAVE DRINK: No alcool (ooohhh!!!).
            He likes many drinks, especially pure fruit juice 
            (like pear, apricot...).  
 
FAVE GIRL: Caroline Munroe (AAARGH! An hearth attack again!)

FAVE POSITION: In his armchair typing an article for the TLB 
               MAGGIE (liar!).

FAVE BOOK: Lots of book in his bedroom!
           "LORD OF THE RINGS" by J.R.R. Tolkien
           All Stephen King's books and Alan Moore's comics (they're
           so good I consider them as books!)

FAVE COMPUTER: CRAY II (he promised to buy one... after his Ferrari
               Testarossa).

            "HIGHLANDER", the "STAR WARS" saga, "LORD OF THE 
            RINGS" (again), "ROBOCOP", "INDIANA JONES", "GOLDEN 
            CHILD"...

            (total crap, actually!)

BEST NIGHT OUT: In a "live" ROLE PLAYING GAME (1987)

BEST CONCERT: He never goes to concerts (silly, hey?)

FAVE SIGN: Guess what... The sword!

FAVE GAME: "DUNGEON MASTER" by FTL (the best game ever!)

WORST GAME: So many! "BOOTIFUL BABE" was one of the worst he has 
            ever seen...

FAVE VIRUS: NO!!! HE HATES VIRUSES!

FAVE DEMOCREW: THE CAREBEARS (They're the best!)

BEST DEMO: CUDDLY DEMOS (he is waiting for the UNION 2 and next 
           demos from his fave crews).        

BEST THOUGHT: Receiving a phone call from NICK inviting him to 
              join TCB (everybody can dream!)
              Meeting a Caroline Munroe look-alike girl who would 
              like to share his life... 

WORST THOUGHT: Having to live without any computer and being 
               obliged to make sports, walk-trips and every kinda 
               things outside in the country...
               Having to quit OVERLANDERS (except in the case 
               written above!)

NOTE from SPAZ: Well, I'm not SPAZ. So, I cannot write anything 
                here...


OK, that's all for this crapy article. Thanx to the LOST BOYS for 
publishing it, anyway...
