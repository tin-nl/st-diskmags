A new ice age grips the world and along with fellow pioneers you 
live on the Midwinter Isle, the last habitable oasis on earth. A 
very real threat looms large as invaders attempt to seize your 
sanctuary.

Controlling up to 32 characters, you must defend an immense 
playing area of over 160,000 square miles. You can ski, 
hangglide, snow-buggy or travel by cable car across stunning 
glacial landscape, shooting, sniping and sabotaging the 
intruders...
                                     ...according to the writers.

What can I saw about Midwinter, that hasen't already been said, 
it's a great game with great graphics. You start off controlling 
a single person (Captain John Stark) and your first objective is 
to find some fellow humans to help you on your mission. The game 
is very, very big. What looks a small area on the map, is infact 
a very large area which takes ages to travel across.

On your travels, you'll find places were you can stop and rest, 
refuel and get some more supplies. Once reloaded etc, it's time 
to travel on. You aim, which is to destroy the enemy, is very 
hard from the start. The biggest problem is that the bad dudes in 
the aeroplanes have a nasty habit of bombing you every time you 
try to make some progress. You can avoid this by travelling by 
cable car in, which you get a chance to see some stunning views
and the enemy.

Once you've reached a settlement, you'll find places like 
churches that you can snipe from hopefully people that you can 
recruit. Then it's off to kill the enemy...

My only gripe about Midwinter is the price, but I do think that 
it's a great game that should warrent a place with titles such as 
Dungeon Master and Rainbow Islands. If you haven't got this game, 
then I suggest that you purchase it from a mail-order company and 
get it at a cheaper price then most places.

Now for the ratings...

GRAPHICS:  98%  These are great, you get a real feeling of being 
                their...  
SOUND:     80%  Good effects throughout the game.
APPEAL:    70%  This game take a lot of getting into, mainly 
                because it's not a game that you can just sit 
                down and play.
OVERALL:  95%   Buy it, or if you can't, get somebody else to buy 
                it for you!
