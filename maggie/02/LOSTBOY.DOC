DEAR  GUYS,  (DEAR?????) AS YOU HAVE ASKED FOR PEOPLE TO WRITE  TO 
YOU, I AM DOING SO, AND WHILST YOU ANSWER ALL OUR LETTERS,YOU WILL 
GET     FURTHER    BEHIND    WITH    YOUR     VARIOUS     PROJECTS 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
        
ANYWAY,  I  AM JUST GETTING OVER A SENSORY GLUT OF WUNNERFUL DEMOS 
ETC ESPECIALLY THE MEGAMIGHTY MINDBOMB DEMO PRODUCED BY YOURSELVES 
AND  ASSISTED  BY  VARIOUS GROUPS AND  INDIVIDUALS.  I  HAVE  ALSO 
ENJOYED THE DISK MAGAZINE, WELL UP TO `ST NEWS` STANDARD, LONG MAY 
IT CONTINUE.  All in all, I had a very good Atari `90 show, coming 
home  with  a heavily discounted STE under my arm,along  with  the 
fistful  of new demos from the nice `Mr 16-32 PD man,  at the same 
time  spotting Sammy-Joe of the Lostboys on the stand (Long  hair, 
dishevilled  appearance  and  a  dying  wordprocessor  under   his 
fingers.....well    it   was   the   Sunday...)   Talking    about 
wordprocessors,can`t  you  tell  it  is ages  since  I  have  been 
anywhere near one by the crap that passes for the first  paragraph 
and a half.
 
Naturally,having got the STE home,I decide to plug it in  straight 
away,  with  trepidation that none of the lovely demos would  work 
with it,  but the mindbomb demo was ok,(in STE compatability terms 
that  is)  also the TEC demo,  and most of the Alliance XTC  demo. 
further investigations revealed the following were all ok with the 
STE, The Aenigmatica Genesys demo, the Carebears So Watt demo, the 
Swedish New Year Demo, the lost boys Def demo, the Tex Amiga demo, 
(unbelievably) the B.I.G.  demo,  and the Early Tex Demos (LCD LSD 
etc.) The bad news is that the TCB cuddly Demos,and the Whattaheck 
copyparty  demos  do not want to know,  and the phalanx  demo  and 
Dynamic  Duo  `Ultimate  demo  are  severly  corrrupted  (that  is 
`buggered   for  plain  english  fanatics).   Interestingly,   the 
supposedly  unusable Union Demo can be tricked into loading on  my 
STE and it runs apart from a couple of screens.

Generally,  the  STE  will cock up the border scroll,  leaving the 
main  graphics and music intact,  it some times runs with a skewed 
colour scheme (witness Phalanx and Dynamic Duo).  I also find that 
the  Union Demo is more likely to boot if the machine is cold,  IE 
has  been  left a while.  Overall,  from my investigations,  I have 
found that around 50-60% of machine demos will run on the STE.  It 
would seem that reports of 80% failure are wrong and made by Amiga 
owners  (That is when they get the time to do this  after  telling 
everyone how wonderful their machine is ad nauseum...)

THINGS THAT GO BUMP ON THE STE PART 2..............

YES,,,,YOUR  DISK  MAGGIE!!!!!!!   It  does  not  function  as  it 
should..It loads,  then leaves the drop-down menus,  dropped down, 
and  scrolls a loaded article down the left hand side of the  page 
only making it very difficult to read, fortunately I still have my 
old  machine  (vintage 1987 pre TOS 1.09) and it  worked  fine  on 
this. maybe next issue it will be ok????

A final word on the STE debate,  lets have one!!!!  But seriously, 
the  more  information on what runs on it out of your 400  odd  PD 
disks  would  be  welcome,  maybe other readers  can  supply  this 
information,  experiences  etc.  overall  I  am pleased  with  the 
machine and look with confidence at its prospects.

Thats  the CH public service announcement out of the way,  now for 
some more mindless drivel,, well I will have to stop writing soon  
as my cat is pestering for food and attention and is annoyed  that 
a  flickery  screen is keeping both away from her.  She  is  Lucy, 
tabby,specialist subject, scampering up trees, miaowing, food, and 
rolling around on her stomach waiting to be tickled.

I am not enclosing my biographical details, not even on a `revenge 
You-show-me-yours-and-I`ll-show-you-mine-basis,   yours   in   the 
maggie  was just too gruesome for words...  Do people REALLY live  
like that?????????????????????

I enclose a little something, the custom I suspect in this land, I 
am  not a hot-shot programmer,  (I barely make the grade as a crap 
musician)  so  I have enclosed a Quartet `Quickie file,  with  the 
voiceset to run it,  hopefully these will get better as I do...The 
voiceset  put together by my crazy friend who does strange  things 
with  Replay  4,  we should have some weird and wonderful  samples 
soon, pulled off the good ol` CD player to bung into a few quartet 
songs.

Talking about things CD is it not about time ACE magazine  changed 
its name to CDI monthly?????(a good question that.)

THTHTHTHats allll for now folks....

PS this done on 1st word, feel free to put this in the next maggie 
if  you are short of things to put in it,  as you are aware I  can 
bullshit for ages, which goes with my job (yes I have to work dear 
friends)  and  will  probably  write  for  future  issues  unless 
stopped!!!!!! 
                     TaTa for now Chris...
