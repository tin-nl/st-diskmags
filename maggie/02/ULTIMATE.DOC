               THE ULTIMATE GFA DEMO
                          By Michael Schuessler

Hi  there,  the  1st Issue of this great magazine has  just  been 
released  and here I am typing away one article after  the  other 
for  the forthcoming Issue.  This article is about a  demo  which 
apparently has been written in a 100% GFA Basic or as some  might 
say,  a  crappy language.  Whoever says that one cannot  do  nice 
demos  in GFA Basic should definitely take a look at this  double 
sided  product.  The guys who programmed this demo admit to  have 
some  machine code routines,  but only for there where  they  use 
samples.   Now,  if  the  rest  has  really  been  coded  without 
assembler,  they  have made a miracle happen (see description  of 
some of the screens later on in this article). 

All in all,  this demo contains about 13 screens,  some of  which 
are crap, BUT some are very good indeed. The disk is double sided 
and should run on a machine with only 1/2 megabyte. Now let's get 
on to the actual review.

The demo starts off with a great intro,  it is overscan (this  is 
one  of the screens that I think there is no way that  they  have 
coded that in GFA Basic !!!!!). I am not saying that they haven't 
managed it, but even if it is in machine code, it is very nice.

After this little intro a text screen comes up, giving the viewer 
various information on the demo.  It is a bit of a shame that  it 
does not continue straight on to the main menu,  instead it  goes 
to the desktop and wants you to click onto a program.
 
The loader is not bad either, first of all you some text comes on 
the  screen and soon after that,  every other line of  that  text 
starts bouncing up and down.  Soon after that,  a bigger piece of 
graphix  (fullscreen,  (but  then again it is  only  every  other 
line)) bounces in from the top and starts to move around.  Pretty 
nice !

The  menu consists of 12 squares on which you can read the  names 
of the screens. Some of the names are SPREADPOINT DEMO II, or BIG 
SPRITE,  or  WHO  DARES and many more.  Of course  one  remembers 
straight away the name SPREADPOINT from the great Cuddly Demo  by 
The Carebears from Sweden.  This conversion is definitely one  to 
take  a closer look at !!!  Anyway,  you can select  the  various 
screen via the cursor keys. By pressing in the various directions 
the  cursor will advance in the corresponding direction.  At  the 
bottom  (in  the bottom border) there is  another  scrolline,  it 
looks similar to the one in the Union demo on the main menu.  You 
know  what I mean (Harry ?),  it is the crystal scroller  through 
which you can see landscape.    

Finally  succeeded  in directing the cursor on  the  1st  screen. 
Grrrgg  and  my  drive gets going.  The screens  in  between  the 
various  demos and simple,  they basically inform you  about  the 
screen you are about to see. 
This part of the demo is in fact the worst part.  It consists  of 
a  few  sprites bouncing about and a one plane starfield  at  the 
top. Do not dispair, there are better screens to come.

The second screen of the demo is already a lot better.  Again  it 
has a starfield which consists of a few more planes this time,  a 
flipping scroller, which again was done the 1st time in the Union 
Demo  !!!!  Somewhere  in  the middle of the screen  there  is  a 
flipping and wobbling (both at the same time) logo.

Back  in the main menu the cursor does not stay at  the  position 
where you left off,  it always goes back to the centre.  The  3rd 
screen :  There are two rows of bouncing sprites,  one at the top 
and another one in the middle. In between there is the background 
moving  about.  At the bottom of the screen there is a  scroller. 
There are also three more sprites in the same area.

Number 4:  I reckon that this screen is very nice, it consists of 
spectrum  picture  (the one with the many bricks) and  over  this 
picture there scrolls a 3D scroller (very nice!!). Along with all 
that  you get a very nice tune from MAD MAX.  It is the one  with 
the  sampled drums from the game :  Chambers  of  Shaolin.  Great 
screen.

The  next screen is not too exiting,  the back-and foreground  is 
moving,  a scroller and some sprites.  I reckon that this  screen 
lacks some decent graphix.

Screen number 6 is the one that you can find in just about  every 
demo. It's the screen featuring a BIG sprite. As the name already 
tells you,  there is a big sprite on the screen, a scroller and a 
bouncing starfield !!!! 

The next screen has aimed to beat one of the Carebears's screens. 
As the GFA Programmers say, they have beaten the Carebears, there 
are 35 sprites on the screen following different patterns.  Looks 
quite  nice,  but it gets a bit boring as there is  nothing  else 
happening on the screen !!!
When you want to exit this screen you are presented with  another 
screen,  it is similar to the one in the Mindbomb demo called RED 
SECTOR.  Their sprites are good,  but not as good as ours.  Along 
with these sprites you get some nice musix. 

The  next screen is already quite famous and as I have  mentioned 
before,  it has already been done in another demo,  yes, and here 
it  is,  let  me present to you ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  GFA 
conversion  of  the SPREADPOINT demo from the  CUDDLY  Demos.  As 
everybody  already  knows  this screen (hopefully)  I  will  only 
explain what's different in it.  The sprite at the beginning is a 
bit smaller, instead of the sampled musix you only get sound chip 
musix.  There  aren't  as many small scrollers and  there  is  no 
twist scroller either.  All in all, I reckon that these guys have 
done a pretty good job for GFA.

Many  many  small  scrollers,  a bouncing  starfield  and  a  few 
sprites.  That's  what  you  will find in the  screen  after  the 
Spreadpoint II demo.  Sorry that I haven't described this  screen 
in  much detail,  but I am rather hungry and therefore I want  to 
finish this article.

Screen number 11: This screen has been released before the actual 
demo,  it is the WHO DARES screen. This screen tries to challenge 
one of the Carebears screens.  It starts off with a great sample, 
then  continues with JUST a scroller and if you wait long  enough 
you will have some musix, parallaxing, shrinking/growing sign and 
a few other things. This screen is one of my favourite screens in 
the demo. Definitely worth watching till the end.

The screen following the 11th one is not too good.  By now I  got 
the impression that they were repeating themselves too often, but 
then again,  that happens in every demo. So, this screen consists 
of  a  scroller,  a starfield and some sprites.  ( I  think  that 
there  is some more,  but I have only got some dots on  my  notes 
paper, so let's just assume that there is more !).

Here  it  finally is,  the last screen.  It is called  the  Balls 
Screen.  A  scroller where the font consists of  bubbles,  balls, 
circles or whatever you want to call it.  This scroller is pretty 
big,  not to say enormous and bounces up and down while scrolling 
through  the  screen.  It  uses the  bottom  border  (ain't  that 
great !!!).

Finito. Oh, I should better give you the summary shouldn't I ?

		HERE'S THE 2ND REVIEW:

                The Utltimate GfA Demo of the Overlanders
                                by Stad'
                                       
Here comes the new GfA demo of the Overlanders. This demo is really
amazing! For most of the screens it's really hard to believe that the
screen is in pure GfA 3.0!! The demo has 15 screens including the 3
loader and the main menu. First, when you boot your ST a fullscreen
demo appears with a screen full of little 'Ovr' logos moving from the
left to the right. Then a black & white pic appear saying "no asm", 
"Ultimate demo coming" etc.. After a while the GfA Basic editor 
appears with a little text on the demo. After pressing space the 
Desktop apear and you have to double-click on Loader.Ugd to run the
demo. A ultimate demo logo appears with effects and then a big logo
'Ovr' scrolls in all the directions at very very high speed. The 
credits appear and the main-menu is loaded. It consists of a pic
and a scroller in the bottom border. You can select the screens with
the cursor keys. Here is a little description of all the screens:

ONIRIC DEMO:
starfield, volume level indicator, bouncing logo, sprites and text.
MINIDIST DEMO: 
starfield, dist scrolltext, and mega "Minidist" distorted logo.
MANYBALLS DEMO:
scrolltext, many balls, sprites, nice logo, little background scroll.
3D SCROLLER:
nice pic, nice logo, digisynth music, 3D scrolltext (hard to describe)
HARDSCROLL:
scrolltext, sprites, 2 plane backround scrolling.
BIG SPRITE DEMO:
a real big sprite, stars, scrolltext. 
BONUS SCREEN:
35 balls moving around.
VECTORBALLS 3:
The Ovr's Redsector demo GfA version with half soundtracked music.
SPREADPOINT 2:
The Ovr's Spreadoint demo GfA version from the Cuddly Demos.
MULTISCROLL:
stars, 10 balls moving around and many little scrolltexts.
SHUFLEPUNKER DEMO:
starfield, parallax land scroll, sprites, scrolltext.
MEGABALLS:
Incredible!! Hyper mega big boucing scrolltext goign in the border!

This GfA demo is much better than many assembler demos! It's really
a great demo.
