
THE SPACE ACE SOLUTION BY BEN DOLLEY

  For all you poor people still trying to complete the game SPACE 
ACE,I  am  going to give you the complete  solution  starting  of 
course from scene 1.

  Scene 1

  For you dipsticks who can`t even get passed scene 1 move  RIGHT 
after the second laser shot then LEFT when the laser hits the top 
of the rock that Dexter is hiding behind.Now move DOWN to  escape 
the next blast and you have completed this scene.
 
  Scene 2 

  Now you meet the mining  robot so move RIGHT at  the  beginning 
then move LEFT.You can only do the next move if you can count  to 
three  when  you  have moved left count to three  and  move  LEFT 
again.Now when you hear a whirring sound move LEFT again.

UP.

  When the mud monster pops up press FIRE to blow it`s brains out 
without being eaten.

  Move RIGHT then RIGHT again.

  Scene 8

  Move DOWN then RIGHT to avoid the purple monster.

  Scene 9

   Wait  a  minute  I`ve used 3.5 pages  and  have  only  done  9 
scenes,so know I am going to write each scene in a  sentence,thus 
meaning that each new sentence is a new scene.

   Press  FIRE to kill the monster.Wait till 2 cats  appear  then 
move  UP.Now move UP to dodge the 2 dogs.Now move RIGHT when  you 
meet the intersection.Move UP so the dogs run into the  trap.Move 
RIGHT  to  dodge the laser beams.Move LEFT to  dodge  the  energy 
bolt.Move  LEFT to dodge another energy bolt.Move RIGHT to  dodge 
another  energy  bolt.Now move UP to climb the ladder  of  Borf`s 
lair.When  Borf attacks press FIRE to block his staff  then  move 
RIGHT to dodge his kick.Press FIRE to block his staff.Press  FIRE 
to dodge his staff blow then move RIGHT.Immediately press FIRE to 
block  another staff blow and move DOWN to dodge  his  kick.Press 
FIRE yet another time to block Borf`s staff.Now move UP then DOWN 
to complete this scene.Move LEFT at the last moment to jump  onto 
the passing rope.Now move RIGHT to leap to safety.Move RIGHT when 
the  blast  hits the ground.Now do the same  but  move  LEFT.Move 
RIGHT  on  this scene.Move LEFT immediately then  RIGHT  to  kill
