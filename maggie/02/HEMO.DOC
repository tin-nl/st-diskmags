                              by Michael Schuessler

I bet that you do not know what the Hemo-Sound Demo is all  about 
or do you ?  Anyway, if you do know something than count yourself 
very lucky !!!  Now this article is dedicated for all the  people 
out  the who are depressed/pissed off (cause their computer  blew 
up and they had to pay 80 pounds to get it repaired)/cause  their 
girl friend left them or whatever. 

The  sound  demo has been produced by  the  HEMBROIDS.  They  had 
already  done one but it wasn't too good so here's  their  second 
version!!!  Well it is not really a second version, it is more or 
less a new demo.  As the word sound indicates,  by the way, sound 
means Ton/Laut in German so if this Kraut-word appears you should 
know  what it means !!!  (This was your 1st step to learn how  to 
speak  fluently  in German).  Anyway,  as the  word  Ton  (Sound) 
indicates  this  demo has something to do with some  noise  being 
produced by this mega cool machine in front of you.  As there are 
many  demos of this kind floating around at the moment  you  have 
guessed right, it is a 4 channel Ton demo. 

When you first insert the disk you get a small intro with a  sign 
saying  Hembroids  bouncing up and down.  There is also  a  small 
message  on  this  sign which tells you to  lookout  for  a  demo 
written by GEN4 in order to challenge them (hope that it will  be 
better). Along with that you get some flickering background which 
goes  over the left/right border.  You are then asked  to  strike 
your RETURN key.

The program than continues loading.  After a while a picture will 
come  up  on  the  screen which will  look  vaguely  familiar  to 
Metallica fans (it is an arm sticking out of a toilet !!!). along 
with  that there is (again) a big sign that indicates  that  what 
you are watching right now is the HEMO SOUND demo II,  because as 
you have probably guessed it says HEMO-SOUND II. The program then 
continues to load...

Finally when you can see some  dark blue lines flickering in  the 
background you know that you are about to see it,  yes, it is the 
evil  chair  with a tune from the FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS  of  their 
latest album.  In fact,  this first tune is, as all the others, 4
channels. The quality of the sound is pretty damn good (as far as 
I could judge it with all the hissing of my monitor).  

If  you  do not know what the name of the song is  that  you  are 
currently  hearing,  have a look at the first line of the  screen 
where  the filename is displayed and of which you should be  able 
to work it out. 

THIS  NEXT FEATURE has (probably) been included for all the  Hip-
Di-Hop fans out there.  By pressing the return key, the tune will 
be  played backwards or something like that and therefore  sounds 
like Hip-Hop (or in other words like a loda bollox).  

If  you  read  the  text  at  the  bottom  of  the  picture  (and 
understand it) you will press the Help key.  The disk drive  will 
then go on and read the desktop but it will only display the  MOD 
files.  You can then see all the MOD files in one go !!! You then 
have the possibility to type in one of the filenames in order  to 
play it.

If you count all the MOD files you will have to stop at 14 (cause 
there aren't any more!!!)(I reckon that that is enough anyway!!).
Most  of the other tunes are also pretty famous,  they  are  from 
bands like Aplhaville (with their great hit "Big In  Japan"),  or 
the  tune  from the game Goldrunner or a  already  mentioned  the 
tune by the Fine Young Cannibals.  I have heard most of the other 
tunes somewhere else but have no idea where !!!! 

So,  that's about it again with this great MOD player.  The  only 
thing that I do not like to much is,  that there is nothing  else 
happening  when  the samples are playing,  not  even  any  volume 
indicators. The REST IS GREAT.
