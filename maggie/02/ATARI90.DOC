                         by Sammy Joe of TLB

It is show time again,  here's a show,  there's a show, and we in 
London have the Atari Show.  The show began early in the  morning 
on a Friday, to be more exact, the 1st of June. I only arrived at 
the  show  at 2 o' clock cause  some people still have to  go  to 
school.  As  all the English pupils were on holiday at that  time 
the show was pretty crowed for a Friday afternoon.  Now,  what do 
you do in order to get in free ?  Simple,  just go to one of  the 
lovely women waiting for visitors to enter in order to hand  them 
a  paper  which contains a map...(more to  that  later).  Anyway, 
after  having  talked  to  that woman for 1  minute  I  made  her 
understand that I am exhibiting at the show.  I told her the name 
of  the  stand on which I was supposedly be  exhibiting  and  she 
went  off  in  order to get the stand  owner.  When  he  came  he 
persuaded  the safety (it's cause we are so mean  and  dangerous) 
guards to let us in free.  We then went to the Show Office  where 
a lovely lady gave us some passes. We then went downstairs to the 
persons  stand ( I bet you would love to know who that person  is 
?).  His  stand was pretty crowded and have a guess whom  we  met 
there straight away,

                         THE REPLICANTS.

As  we  (me and Spaz) had not talked to them for a long  time  we 
went to some place where it wasn't too crowed and had a long long 
took  about puberty and masturbating (I think I will not go  into 
more detail).  After having exchanged a few more disks we had  to 
part already as the Replicants (bloody frogs,  always in a  rush) 
had to return to France.

I then went on to visit a few more friends of mine like 16/32 and 
Budgie UK.  As I had only spoken to Camy Maertens on the phone it 
was  really nice to meet him in person.  I quickly  occupied  his 
Atari  ST  in  order to copy things.  Budgie UK  was  as  usually 
selling  their  great games and their  even  better  productivity 
range.  16/32 only had their latest disks with them (but that was 
definitely enough to keep them busy for the 3 days). 

Now,  let's get down to some more serious stuff. This leaflet one 
was  handed by these lovely women at the entrance    got    quite 
useful after some time.  As  the  show was  unexpectedly   rather
big the maps in the leaflet  came  quite handy.

Here's  a  list  of all the people who exhibited  at  this  show: 
16/32,  Budgie,  AEM,  A & S distributing,  Arnor, Association of 
Atari User Groups,  Audio Visual Research,  Babel  Systems,  Care 
Electronics  ( they did not appear to care to much when  I  asked
one  of their staff something),  CMV Computers,  Computer  World, 
Condor Computer,  Dowling Computers,  Eclipse computers, Frontier 
Software,  Gasteiner,  GFA DATA MEDIA,  HISOFT,  KUMA, Microdeal, 
Page  6 Publishing,  Riverdene PDL (thanks,  you know what  for), 
Silica Shop,  Stampede, ST Club, ST Format, SWSL and 3rd Coast. I 
hope  that I have mentioned the most important one.  As  you  can 
see there were quite a few stands there NOT TO forget that  ATARI 
finally  convinced  themselves that it would not do any  harm  to 
attend a show with even their own stand. 

ATARI  was showing off their LYNX,  STACY and their  small  Atari 
Portfolios. All in all Atari were quite cooperative at this show. 
What a shame that they still haven't released their  TT's.  Their 
small Atari Portfolios are some nice toys, but I reckon that what 
I saw of them at the show did not impress me too much.  The  keys 
were far too small, the space bar was in a weird position.... All 
in  all I reckon that it is a nice machine if you want to use  it 
for  storing telephone numbers or that kind of  thing.  What  you 
might also find it useful is, if you want to impress your friends 
and you take it to school.  Then you can say tht you are carrying 
a  REAL  computer  with you at all  times.  If  you  compare  the 
Portfolio  with  others in the same class you  will  find  better 
ones.  I will say nothing about the Lynx as there is an exclusive 
review in this issue by A. Craig. 

Something  that  I thought was well organized by  the  organizers 
were the seminars throughout the 3 days of the show.  (Although I 
could  not attend any of them,  I will try to tell you  something 
about  them).  What I thought was a bit of a shame was,  was  the 
some of the seminars took place at exactly the same time. Anyway, 
the seminars dealt with Mandarin's STOS. Mandarin introduced STOS 
with its features. 
Another seminar dealt with the Atari Portfolio. If you went to to 
this  seminar  you  would have got a  technical  overview  and  a 
demonstration of it's speed and power. 
Atari  held some more seminars in order to demonstrate the  Lynx, 
their new products and some other not so important things. 
Therer  were some more seminars at the show which I rated as  not 
being too important so I will not talk about them.


The Commercial Sector:
----------------------

HiSoft  finally released a new version of their great  Assembler: 
DEVPAC. This time it is 2.2. This version does not appear to have 
many more functions but as I was told the programmer has  removed 
various bugs and sped it up even more.  As soon as I have my copy 
of  Devpac 2.00 updated I will give you a full review of the  new 
features...

GFA  appeared to have rated this show pretty high as  their  head 
man (Dr. Wolfgang Buscher) from Germany decided to spend his time 
at  the show.  GFA have recently released the latest  version  of 
their great CAD program,  GFA Draft plus version 3.00.  This  CAD 
program is one of its kind,  it has many features and the  manual 
is just excellent (cause I translated it into English).  This CAD 
program is well worth it's money. 

The  show  did not really have any good bargains for  the  buyers 
except the odd game here and there.  None of the Software  places 
felt  like going down with the prices to an acceptable  level.  I 
do  not  think that if you pay 16 pounds for a  copy  of  Dungeon 
Master  that you have had a mega good deal ?  You could also  not 
save  youself a lot of money if you went to the show in order  to 
buy a piece of hardware.  If you looked hard and were in the mood 
to bargain with the dealers you could get the odd things cheaper. 
If  you were wanting to buy blank disks and you had  the  correct 
connections  you could get somewhere,  like I for  example  found 
some disks with a rather famous name for 4 pounds for 10 disks.   

Budgie  UK  extended their range now also to Holland  where  they 
have found a great distributor, it is one of the largest computer 
magazines over there!!

Stampede released another issue of their magazine.  I  personally 
reckon that this issue here is a lot better than all their issues 
put together. Sorry guys, but that is my honest opinion. 
   
In  the  Atari Arcade section there were many  new  releases  but 
nothing  in  particular.  The only game that I  though  is  worth 
looking out for is F29 Retaliator,  a very good fighter  aircraft 
simulation with excellent 3D graphix.


The PD Sector:
--------------

The  PD  libraries at the show gave themselves the  best  fights. 
They were all copying,  selling PD like hell.  I reckon that they 
copied  roughly one disk per minute and that throughout he  whole 
show (just imagine having that many blank disks at home).  As far 
as I know there weren't many new major PD releases except the 1st 
Issue of TLB Maggie,  another excellent Robocop demo. The Dynamic 
Due were intending to release their 3rd demo at the show but  the 
just did not make it. 


Important people who paid a visit to the show:
----------------------------------------------
In order of their appearance:
Of course it is the Lost Boys,  the Replicants, the Watchmen, New 
Order,  The Black Cats,  Andy and Phil,  some guys from  Autowho, 
Derek Mc Donalds,  Magic Circle,  the Revolutions,  Dynamic  Duo, 
Inner  Circle  (Electronic Images,  ST Squad and some  others  of 
their  group).  If  I have missed anyone,  please  write  to  our 
complaints office !!!! 

All  in all I think that the show was definitely worth going  to. 
Talking and meeting up with lodsa intersting people.  I hope that 
you felt the same way. 

                                   See you at the next show

                                             Sammy Joe of TLB

P.S.:  In  the end I did get in free but I helped out at  various 
       stands like Budgie UK, 16/32 and various others.
