I have only seen two demos for the STE which really show off it's 
capabilities.    These are The STE Demo and The STE Jungle  Demo.   
Neither  of these demos do much,  but what they do they  do  VERY 
well.    The STE Demo shows off 4,096 colours on screen at  once, 
stereo sound,  wibbley sprites,  a scrolling star field,  lots of 
scrolling  ATARI  signs,  not to mention a  French  Scroll  line,  
which  I  have deciphered having taken French at  school,  so  if 
anyone  wants a translation write to me via The Lost  Boys.   The 
best  part of the demo is the piece of Axel F music which  is  in 
stereo,  but  I'm  not sure whether it is sound chip music  or  a 
sample.


The  STE Jungle Demo plays stereo music of jungle sounds and  two 
little funny men, which do the weirdest things (oo er!).  On this 
demo  you can clearly see the 4,096 colour on screen at once (  I 
may be wrong,  but if anyone would like to count the colours  and 
tell me I'm wrong I will admit it).   I haven't really found  out 
what to do on this demo yet,  but I have found that if you  press 
one  of the F-keys the butterfly turns white,  and the curs  keys 
move the butterfly around the 2 by 2 scrolling screen.
