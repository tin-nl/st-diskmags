                                   by Michael Schuessler

You are under arrest and is it you Murphy are probably one of the 
phrases that everybody knows from this excellent film.  There are 
so  many  people  who have done a  ROBOCOP  demo.  There  is  the 
straight  sample demo which only features a picture  and  sampled 
pictures  from the film (1/2 meg version) and there is of  course 
the  one  megebyte  version.  The only difference  to  the  first 
version is that there is a much longer sample.  And of course the 
is  the  Robomix  demo by Electronic  Images  with  animation,  2 
channel  samples.  There  is  also a 2nd  version  of  this  demo 
floating  around which has an additional scroller when you  press 
the  space  bar  (both versions of the Robomix demo  run  on  any 
machine with at least 1/2 megabyte). 

But  now there is also this RoboCop demo by  the  Islander.  This 
Robocop  demo  is  possibly even better  than  the  Robomix  demo 
although they are rather different.  The Islander's version comes 
on  two  double sided disks and only runs on a  machine  with  at 
least one megabyte.  After you have inserted the 1st disk you are 
presented  with  some  text  on the  screen  giving  you  various 
information on the demo.  When it has loaded the whole disk  into 
the memory it asks you to insert the second disk. 

Now,  lean back and enjoy this marvellous graphix and sound demo. 
You will promptly be able to hear a sample which will be with you 
until the demo has finished.  The screen is then,  similar to the 
Snowman  demo,  devided into 4 parts.   The first  animation  you 
will  see is ED209 walking around and firing randomly around  (as 
youprobably  know  that this is the opening  sequences  from  the 
film).   The  demo  then  continues  with  various  pictures  and 
animations. along with each different animation you usually get a 
different sample. Something that amazes me about this demo is how 
much  they managed to get on this disk.  As I have already  said, 
you  always  get a new sample with each animation and  there  are 
millions  of  them.  By  having so  many  different  samples  and 
animations  the  demo appears to be one of the longest  and  best 
animations that I have ever seen on the Atari ST. 

Another scene that is animated is the one where Robocop tries  to 
arrest  the guy at the petrol station.  First you see the  petrol 
station blowing up and then you get the car crashing. This is one 
of  the scenes of the animation that stayed in my mind  from  the 
whole  film.  I reckon that the film goes on for about 5   to  10 
minutes  and  as  I  am feeling really  tired  now  I  will  stop 
reviewing this demo, I hope that 6you enjoyed this review.
