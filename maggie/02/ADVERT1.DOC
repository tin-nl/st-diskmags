This  section  here will always deal with things that are  to  be 
sold.  We  cannot guarantee anything but we hope that  everything 
will always be allright,  i.e.  the games will work, the box will 
contain everything etc....

Anyway,  if  you do have anything that you would like to get  rid 
off,  old games, old computers or whatever you want to advertise, 
just write to us and we will put it in the next Issue,  so here's 
our first Advertiser:
