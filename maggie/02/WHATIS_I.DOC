
With this  article you  are currently staring at, I will  begin a 
regular feature  called  "WHAT IS ... ?". In  them, I  intend  to 
discuss questions,  that seem to pop up in my head and cannot  be 
immediately answered (at least by me).  Let's hope this series is 
a success and I hope you will let me know,  what you think  about 
it (plus ideas, hints and (I can take it) criticism).

WHAT IS ... HEAVY METAL ?   by Oliver Wagner

I was standing in a queue,  waiting to get into a concert, when I 
decided  to  take  a look  at  the  passing  pedestrians.  Nearly 
everybody hurried by, not daring to look any of us waiting in the 
eye,  not  wanting  to provoke  any  unnecessary  bloodshed,  not 
letting their young offspring walk near us.  It was as if we were 
carrying a contagious disease that would be transmitted merely by 
breathing the same air as we were. 
There  was  one  person,  that approached  us  rather  shyly  and 
inquired about the concert (what band was playing).  When we told 
him,  he  looked at us with large eyes,  saying rather naively  : 
"Why do you listen to this kind of music?  Try some "real"  music 
for a change!" I mean, what can you say to that? 

- Are we (that listen to a different kind of music) the  outcasts 
  of society?
- Do we represent the violence and crime of the world of today?
- Why is it, that many (not everybody though) people see us as a 
  danger to humanity (crassly expressed) and trouble-makers?
- Are we really like that?
- Has the postman already rung twice, mum?
- What have we done to deserve this?
- Why do we listen to metal? 
- Why does one go to the restroom to powder one's nose?

These and many more questions remain to be answered,  but firstly 
this...
A  small and therefore incomplete list of famous bands that  have 
in  one way or the other influenced modern Metal (in other  words 
bands  I  (!)  like).  You might as well skip  this  part,  as  it

V: VENOM, VIRUS, VOIVOD etc.

W: WOUND FUCKER (yes, I know) etc.

X: XENTRIX etc. 

This  is  as  has been said a very (with  capital  letters)  VERY 
incomplete  list,  as  I have only stated those which are  to  my 
liking (mostly thrash). 

With names like this (DEATH, TERRORIZER, the "ANGEL"s and the one 
under W, which I dare not mention again), you might well say now, 
if is it any wonder, that Heavy Metal has atracted a bad name. 
As  Heavy Metal is still a minority music,  it is  always  viewed 
from  the mainstream music's angle.  If on the  other  hand,  the 
roles  would  be  reversed,  what would the  now  majority  metal 
listener see in todays pop-music and acid house crap (hehehe, I'm 
feeling really mean right now). 

- Stock,  Aitken and Waterman,  producing so-called songs by  the 
  dozen  (daily),  where so-called stars can  buy them  from  the 
  shelf, because they've got a big wallet. 

- Big busted girls with absolutely no voice, that charm many into 
  thinking, that raving beauties are automatically good vocalists 
  and gifted song writers.

- Every  song  being released has only one thing  in  common  ... 
  well,  two actually.  Firstly the absolute downright  insulting 
  "music" and secondly the aim:  make loadsa money.  I mean, what 
  do these guys take us for.  The sad  part is,  that  it  really 
  works for them: we buy, they  become rich. That's life I guess. 

- The instruments being used:  synthesizer,  computer,  but often 
  also the  most expensive guitars and drumkits.  What for I  ask 
  you? They don't use the instruments for what they are worth. By 
  playing  those poor  instruments with anything less  than  what 
  one is able to derive from  them (meaning as fast and as  heavy 
  (with good songwriting though)), you insult the makers. 
  (Personal opinion by Oliver. The Ed.).

- Names  like "New Kids on the Chop (ah,  Block) and "Fine  Young 
  Maneaters"  to us also  seem kind of weird (I  could  tell  you 
  thousands more examples, if only  I would  be able to  remember 
  them all).  There are  many people listening  Metal,  that  are 
  constantly complaining about too many thrash groups  appearing, 
  that  seem  to copy only from other  already  well  established 
  bands  (like  METALLICA and SLAYER).  But if anybody  of  those 
  complainants were to take a peek into the pop genre, they would 
  see  circumstances even worse than they think is bad in  Metal. 
  Bands  popping  up,  having  one hit  single  and  disappearing  
  immediately afterward, never to be seen again. 

Under those circumstances,  we would probably also stamp pop  and 
acid music as trash (forgot the "h" there). 

What is it then,  that so repulses most upright citizens of today 
from Metal?

- Is  it the violent  image that seems to stick to Metal  like  a 
  stray  dog  does  to  someone who feeds it  (a  dog  is  vastly 
  preferably though)?

- Is it the kind of music,  which they think of as no real  music 
  at all, just noise? 

- Is it, because this person is a hairdresser and he already sees 
  himself bankrupt?

- Is it,  because  his son or daughter also listens to Metal  and 
  thinks  that  because  of that,  they  must  certainly  end  up 
  druggies or deaf or both?

- Is  it,  because he  has seen several long-haired  dudes  being   
  drunk at the local pub, while the  other drunkards weren't even  
  noticed  (his principle of evaluating minority fractions is the 
  following: if one does it, all do it)?

- Or  is it  even,  that he sees a reflection  of  himself  being 
  young,  when  his  parents  told him not  to  listen  to  "this 
  perverted Rock'n'Roll"?

Probably a bit of all of the above applies.  What should be  done 
is  to make people realize,  that Metal is music like any  other. 
Maybe even more so,  as it comes from the heart and not from  the 
computer.  If  people were  to be a  bit  more  tolerant  towards 
something,  which  they don't know that much about,  it would  be 
easier for all involved. 

As  someone,  who  has been listening to Metal for the  past  two 
years,  I maybe see it still in an idealized way.  I don't  think 
Metal is to be seen as a rebellion against certain conventions of 
today,  but  rather  the expression of  frustration.  It  is  not 
misbehaving for misbehaving's sake,  but it is a way to get  away 
from the stiffness of much of today's life  (school,  university, 
parental  "advice"  for  living in the  correct  way).  During  a 
concert,  there  is  a sort of unity,  when everybody is  like  a 
brother  towards each other.  It rarely happens that  someone  is 
hurt  and  then  only because of a rush to  the  front,  like  in 
Sheffield during the notorious football match. 
Metal   is  just  wonderful  for  getting  RID  of  tension   and 
frustration and  definitely NOT for creating it.  At least  head-
banging and stage-diving is better than hitting other people.   

It   certainly  is  true  that  some  people  take  it  all   too 
seriously and  think, that listening to Metal automatically makes 
them mean and tough and therefore have to act this way.  But this 
represents only a small fraction of those listening to Metal.  Of 
all  those,  that  I have met (and there have been quite  a  few) 
about  ninety percent where people liking the music,  wanting  to 
have  some fun and in general not taking the whole  too  serious. 
That's all! 
It  also not only music for the male sex as many people  seem  to 
think.  There are many well known bands,  that prove exactly  the 
opposite  (VIXEN, PHANTOM BLUE, LEATHER, ICE AGE and HOLY MOSES).  
People,  that  listen  to Metal not automatically  have  to  shut 
themselves  of  from any and every other kind  of  music.  I  for 
instance still listen to DIRE STRAITS,  GENESIS, PHIL COLLINS and 
JEAN-MICHEL  JARRE  and think them equally brilliant  as  SLAYER, 
CORONER  and  ACID  REIGN.  So  do  Richard  Karsmakers,  Stephan 
Posthuma and dear old Sammy Joe of the LOST BOYS, if humble me is 
allowed  to  mention these truely Greats of  this  century  (yoh, 
Mike,  where's the raise you offered me). There is one girl in my 
grade at school,  that listens to Metal about twice a week, likes 
it   immensely,   is   told   of  by  her   mother   about   this 
"ohrenbet„ubenden  Krach"  (ear-deafening  noise.  The  Ed.)  and 
reverts  to Oldies.  
Another  point,  I have often been asked about,  particularly  by 
teachers and parents alike,  is the choice of clothing.  The most 
often  taken  off the shelf being jeans jackets ornamented  by  a 
rich  selection of patches and the leather jacket.  This  as  the 
standard  long hair is done for two reasons:  one is because  the 
wearer's taste finds long hair and leather jackets to his  liking 
and the second reason is quite simple.  Instead of running to the 
hairdresser  every  week  and spend a lot of money  you  can  use 
better going to concerts you let it grow.  Simple as  that.  Also 
leather jackets and long hair are very comfortable to  wear/have. 

To  this  day,  I still do not understand why  people  are  still 
suspicious  about Metal.  To me it is all very clear and  I  hope 
I've  made it equally understandable in this  article:  Metal  is 
stands  for fun and enjoyment of life and nothing  else.  If  you 
disagree with me,  that's not my problem,  as it can't be  helped 
anyway.  My view is my view. If you care to discuss this with me, 
drop me a line.

P.S. I think you will enjoy next issue's article on "WHAT IS ..." 
     a bit more. Guess what's it all about... yup, you are right.
     The article's name will be: "Life without Sense". Oh boy, do 
     I like philosophizing. 
     Till next time. Don't miss it.                       
                                           See ya.
