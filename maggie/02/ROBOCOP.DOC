This is the second demo that was written by myself and my  fellow 
mad cow disease sufferer,  Harvey Lodder.  This demo works on any 
ST  or  STE.   It  features  about 13  digi  pics  from  the  yet 
unreleased ROBOCOP 2 film.   Unfortunatly it was not possible  to 
sample  the  sound from the film,  but it does have  a  piece  of 
sample,  sampled at 21 KHz.  The pictures scroll on to the screen 
about every ten seconds.

This demo was also released at the 16 bit computer fair,  and you 
can get a copy from The Lost Boys PD company.
