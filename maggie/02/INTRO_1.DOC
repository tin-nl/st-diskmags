Hi there! Harvey Lodder here writing for the Lost Boys second 
disk magazine. If you haven't got the first one than what the 
fuck are you doing with this one. I mean, this magazine contains 
great stuff such as The Bible II, A Guide To Being A Computer 
Fartie II and other such classics.

At the time of writing, I'm hoping to persuade Sammy Joe to let 
me and several of my partners in crime (Paul Brennan the STE 
owner and Ashley "Virgin" Griffin) have a small section to 
ourselves. But who knows what'll happen???

First of all (assuming that we do have our own section), let me 
introduce you to several people including myself:

1: Harvey Lodder (Me!!!)
   I'm a complete weirdo as somebody once said (I won't mention 
   any names Spaz). I like some heavy metal, but my favourite 
   artist is Madonna. Getting pissed is top of my list on things 
   to do. Going to work is bottom, but due to the problem of 
   needing money to get pissed and to pay the bloody poll tax, I 
   have to go to work! (Sob! Sob!)

2: Ashley "Virgin" Griffin
   Ashley as you might have guessed is still a virgin. He is 
   seventeen years old and lives at home with his parents. Since
   he does not have a girlfriend and is in need of one (even if    
   he does not want one), can all you fellow female Atarians out       
   there please seed him your photo care of the Lost Boys. If    
   you do send Ashley your photo, bear in mind that you stand 
   little chance of winning his love, as he is Samantha Fox's 
   biggest fan. He once called his Atari ST "Samantha" which is 
   a strange but true story!

3: Paul "STE" Brennan
   Ha! What can I say about someone who owns an STE? I know, the 
   TRUTH. Paul is a programmer (or he likes to think he is). He 
   owns one of them new ST's that sound like they're in a bucket 
   of water and they're totally full of shit. The sad thing about 
   this is that he's proud to own one, even though half his games 
   don't work. He has a little brat for a brother, the kind of 
   kid that you want to kick the fuck out of. The only reason
   that I haven't done it yet is because Paul's dad will chuck me
   out the house and give Paul a bad time for the rest of his
   life...

Now that all the bullshit is out of the way, I know that Paul and 
Ashley will get their own back on me later in the magazine, let 
me tell you about the day that I and Paul "STE" Brennan went to 
the ATARI 90'S SHOW.

This was a trip that I had know idea that I was going on until 
the night before, when I was working behind a bar, talking on the 
telephone to Paul about why he should come and get pissed and he 
was telling me why he should not come and get pissed...

STARDATE: Sunday June 3rd - Time 11:00am

I was in bed dreaming of great things such as beaches, girls...

         IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS THEN FUCK OFF

...and large beds. When, suddenly my dream was shattered by the 
roar of the telephone echoing from the hallway.

<RING> <RING> <PAUSE> <RING> <RING> <PAUSE> etc...

Harvey: Hello, eh, who's there?

Paul: It's me.

Harvey: No, I'm me, who are you?

Paul: Ok, it is I, Paul "STE" Brennan. You know the one with the 
      STE that sounds really uncool, a bit like it's been a 
      bucket of water and is full of shit. Anyway, are you 
      crusing over to the show in your magical car? The one that 
      I travel in but never give you any petrol money for?

Harvey: Yeah, give me a while to have a shit, shower and get 
        ready?

Paul: Ok, man! Get down on it.

Harvey: Yeah, bye.

Paul: Yeah man, bye and go with the flow and kinda take...

<CLICK> <BRIRRRRRRR...>

After puting the phone down, I went for a shit and a shower. This 
has nothing to do with this what-so-ever, but I bet you didn't 
know that in Paul's house, he's got a TV in the downstairs 
toilet. I bet that they've either got heavy shit problems or they 
turn the TV up to save them putting a sheet of toilet paper on 
the water before they go for a dump. This reduces the THUD and 
the embarrasing factor when you have guests in the house.

Anyway after going to Pauls house, we planned our route and Paul 
wearing his platform shoes, flowered shirt and flares declaired 
that it was all cool and now was the time to flow on down to 
Hamersmith.

When we arrived, we spent two hours looking for the enterance. 
This was because the underground car park lead into the hotel 
foyer, but the enterance to the show was outside the foyer, a 
few feet down the path and through another set of doors.

After a few minutes at the show and meeting Sammy Joe who we had 
only seen the night before we both left with the following 
things:

Harvey - VIDI upgrade, Shoot-Em-Up Construction Kit which came 
         with a 12 month free subscription to ST Action, 101 
         blank disks, 200 blank disk labels, a copy of Maggie, 3 
         public domain disks and a free copy of New Computer 
         Express.

Paul - The Happy Copier (which cost him 130 quid and he's sent it 
       back to Third Coast because it's a load of bad vibes as he 
       explained to me), a copy of ST User, a free copy of New 
       Computer Express, 101 blank disks, 200 blank disk labels,
       a T-shirt* and a copy of Maggie.

As you can understand, we both had a great time at the show and 
can tell you that if you were not there, then you missed nothing.

                           --- OOO --- 

* While reading this load of shite, Mr. Paul "STE" Brennan was 
  horrorfied to learn that he had bought a T-shirt at the 
  computer show. As he apparently must have lost his T-shirt
  which he didn't buy, but I thought he had bought. He promised 
  to buy one at the next "Computer & Calculator Shopper Show"**.

** He didn't know the name of the "16 Bit Computer Fair" because 
   he was so high, that his mother had tied a rope around his 
   ankle to stop him from floating out the bedroom window.***

*** This is a lie.
