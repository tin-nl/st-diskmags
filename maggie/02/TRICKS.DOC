          Here are some cool tricks for cool games by a cool guy 
(naaaah ! not AN COOL (who's no longer a cool guy coz' he 
preferes to work (it's what he said...) instead of going at sea, 
meet nice tanned girls, drink a lot... All this is very laaaaame !).

RAINBOW ISLANDS : in the '1 or 2 players' selection page, press 
the key "4" to start the game with 5 credits.

FETICHE MAYA : if you feel beeing quite out of energy, press on 
both "SHIFT" keys and on "+" (at the same time (you can use your 
right foot)), then you'll have infinite live.

3D GALAX : go directly to the asteroids by pressing at the same 
time the "Alt" and right arrow keys. 

BEVERLEY HILLS' COP : when you'll be at level 3 (in the garden)
let you be killed and when the game ask you 'Replay this game' 
type "N" (no). Then during the loading sequence which follows 
don't stop pressing the "A" key and you'll begin at the 4th level.

GHOULS'N' GHOST : load the game as usual and then type 'STEPHEN 
BROADHUR'ST', the cheat mode will be actived.

SEVEN GATES OF JAMBALA : (all the dickheads who have a cracked 
version are lamers (except me and Vapour)). During the 
presentation screen press 'YICKE YACKE HCHNERKACKE', keep the 
left "SHIFT" and "1" keys pressed, then stop pressing the "1" key 
and the left "SHIFT" key too : the title is supposed to become 
blue, if it does then try pressing keys "1" to "7" for choising 
the levels, "F1" to "F5" for the choising the weapons, "G" for 
gold and just try some other keys.

DOMINATOR : for infinite lives, type 'SHAFT' in the high scores 
screen instead of your name (or type 'ZAE of NeXT' for having a 
hidden game with full-screen, vector graphics and soundtracked 
music).

NINJA WARRIORS : type the following codes while presing the "Alt" 
key : 'CASABLANCA', 'THE TERMINATOR', 'GENISIS OF THE DALEKS', 
'SKIPPY', 'A SMALL STEP FOR A MAN', 'EAT TO THE BEAT' ('Q' for 
variations) and 'MONTY PYTHON'.

BATTLE VALLEY : type 'ROGER MELLIE THE MAN ON THE TELE' for 
infinite tanks.

DARKSIDE : press the "2" and "8" keys with the fire button for 
seeing digitized pictures by the programmers of the game.

DRAGON NINJA : during the game type 'TERRIFIC', now by pressing 
the "F3" key you'll have infinite lives and with the "L" key 
you'll go to the next level.

HAWKEYE : when you're about to die and that you don't have any 
live left press the "Delete" key for going to the next level. For 
infinite lives, press during the game the 'pause' key, then press 
the "Help" key and press again the 'pause' key.

STRYX : press the keys "Help", "M" and "E" at the same time for 
obtaining infinite energy. You can also add pressing the "P" keys 
(still at the same time as the other keys) for going everywhere 
and add pressing the "F10" key (still at the same time as the 
other keys) for seeing the end of the game.

LED STORM : type 'DAVID BROADHURST WANTS TO CHEAT' to have 
infinite time.

          Well, I'm a bit tired now so I will continue tomorrow. 
See ya soon...
