...The time is 9:30pm on Monday the 7th July. It's Harvey Lodder 
at the keyboard and I've promised that I'll write some more 
articles for the Lost Boys Disk Magazine II. The Terminator is 
blaring out the television and will shortly be followed by 
Commando. What shall I write? I've done four or five reviews so 
far. An article that takes the piss out of Paul 'STE' Brennan and 
The Bible II. Just to clear up a slight problem, I ripped the 
Bible from the previous magazine out of an article that I found, 
but I did change a few bits that I felt I should do. However, the
Bible II which is in this issue has been totally written by me...

...God I'm bored. My keyboard feels sticky and my eyes hurt which 
means by the end of the night I'll be in real fucking pain...

...Maybe I should put my glasses on...

...That's better, I can see now, but I don't know what I'll use 
to drink out of...

...Now for a plea. If any of you DEMO crews are out there and are 
reading this, can you please send me copies of your latest demos 
and I'll return your disks back to you. My address is in the Sim 
City review...

...What else can I tell you about? Yes I know! The other night, 
me and Paul 'STE' Brennan were down at the Ritz getting pissed 
with a few mates including someone called Richard. Anyway, to cut 
a long story short, Richard got totally pissed and stripped off 
his shirt and started to slash his chest up with broken glass. 
This was rather annoying because we wanted to watch the football 
and he was putting us off by making a mess with his blood...

...The same night, I farted...

...Did you go to the 16 Bit Computer Fair? Good show me thinks. 
The past me had a very good time there, as the present me types 
this and you'll be reading this when the future me is doing 
something else???...

...Now seriously, if you're still reading this crap. (I was told 
that I could write anything I wanted to!) Buy the Back To The 
Future Demo from the Lost Boys or the Robocop II Demo if you 
already have the previously mentioned demo...

...What I want to know is do fish get bored swimming around in 
their goldfish bowls? I mean if you were locked in the same room 
for the whole of your life, don't you think that you would be 
pissed off? I think that you would...

...It is now 9:58pm. I guess that I should be getting on with 
writing about computer farties, but YYYYYYYYYYYYYY (sorry, I 
pressed the 'Y' key by mistake) it's just getting to a good bit 
on the film...

...Now that the good bit is over, I'm dying for a drink, well I'm 
not dying but I'm very thirsty at the moment...

...Thats better, now the bit you've all been waiting for, the 
credits, no seriously, it's time for this...

              ...The final part, until next time...


In our last guide, we left Fartie in the shops with his mates and 
detailed his failed attempts at buying himself a computer game. 
Well, now we'll tell you about 'Fartie At The Party' with his 
mates.

Imagine the party. Twenty sweaty bodies are all prancing around 
in somebodys front room who decided to throw a party. The host of 
the party is totally pissed, who will apart from suffer from a 
humoungous hang-over in the morning, will have to throw away all 
their furniture after the partys finished. Of course, this brings 
me onto the subject of the spare room were Fartie is. At most 
partys, the spare room is used to keep coats, condoms and the 
couple that you find under the carpet six months after the partys 
finished. But this room is empty because Fartie is in there. And 
what is he thinking about, not girls, booze, dope or a shag. No, 
Farties looking around the room and thinking what a wonderful 
place this would be to keep all his Z80 Machine Code referance 
books.

Anyway, the party has been going on for a few hours and one of 
Farties mates venture into the spare room and they find Fartie 
who is waiting to go home so that he can play on his computer. 
After much hassle, they persuade Fartie to go downstairs and join 
in. So here we find Fartie with his pint of Babycham listening to 
'Bomb The Bass' and thinking about 'Xenon II'. Now the host of 
the party who we shall call Sharon, she is totally pissed and 
bumps into Fartie and drags him onto the dance floor which is a 
new experance for Fartie.

The music is playing and on comes the slush for the 'Erection 
Section' which Fartie complies with, much to the pleasure of his 
mates. "Get in there","Go on Fartie" they yell. So Fartie then 
follows his dick and goes off to the spare room with Sharon...

...Now we all know what happens next, while Fartie is about to 
pump away at Sharon, he remembers a game that he once played and 
due to being pissed on his Babycham, Fartie says, "Eh, Sharon? 
You look like somebody on a computer game... I think that it was 
Teenage Queen. I was..." <<<SLAP>>> <<<OUCH>>>

Fartie runs from the room holding his bleeding nose, falls down 
the stairs and through the glass front door, making a mess of the 
glass. One hosiptal trip later and Fartie is at home with his 
computer. As he thinks back, he decides that 'Partying With A 
Fartie' is not for him. So he'll go back to reading he Z80 
Machine Code referance guide.

Anyway, Fartie is pretty depressed about this whole situation, so 
he decides that he'll pack his computer up in a box and shove it 
into the loft and never use it again. So Fartie goes into the 
loft to find some empty cardboard boxes. He would have usually 
used the ones that he could find in anybody elses spare room, but 
due to the fact of the room being full up of computer manuals, 
magazines and referance books, he decides against this.

As Fartie searches around the loft he finds a small black box. 
Upon opening it, he finds his first computer, the Sinclair 
Spectrum! Tears start to fill his eyes as he remembers the good 
old days and he decides that 'just one go won't hurt'. So down he 
comes, cluching his Spectrum, games, magazines and manuels and 
the circle starts again. Fartie now has two computers and the 
problem is now twice as bad.

So, until next time, it's goodbye...

...The time is now 10:49 and I've just started watching Commando 
while typing this shit. If there's any spelling mistakes then 
it's too bad. I'm knacked and I've good some reviews to do, so 
let's wrap...
