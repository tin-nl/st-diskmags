This article is about how you get wonderful effects on your 
computer screen without using any PCU time at all, these 
ideas all work and if you use any of them please greet me in your 
demo.

                           FULL SCREEN
                         ---------------

Go to the back of your monitor and you will notice two knobs, one 
says enlarge screen vertically and the other says enlarge screen 
horizontally, all you have to do now is turn those full on and 
there you have a full screen use no PCU time.


                              MUSIC 
                            ---------

This is even simpler to do, all you need is a stereo, yes you 
guessed it switch it on and there you have music and all PCU time 
free to do whatever else you want.


                     2,000,000 STAR STAR FIELD
                    ---------------------------

All you have to do for this is unplug your computer and there you 
have millions of tiny stars jumping about every where, it's just 
so amazing.  

                      HARD-HARDWARE SCROLLING?
                    ----------------------------

Right now pick up your monitor and start swinging it around your 
head using the power cable and WOW you've managed to do hard-
hardware scrolling.

                              WOBBLER
                            -----------

Try sticking your monitor in a bath and you get a wobbler, you 
also die because if you remember water conducts electricity so 
you will go 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
and die.
