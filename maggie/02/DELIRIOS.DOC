                      The DELERIOUS DEMO II
                         by the Alliance
                     (mostly by Overlanders)

     Well I know that this bunch of guys are not all that popular 
with many of their fellow Frenchman or indeed a lot of other 
people it would seem. Personally I reckon they are a pretty good 
bunch of coders, although I have to admit that they lack 
originality in places. Still, I think that in order to criticise 
the Overlanders you should at least be better than they are, so a 
few other French people should take notice of this. Mentioning no 
names!!!!
     Right well now on with the review:-

     The demo has a nice title screen consisting of a logo with a 
nice 3d starfield, a reasonable 4 track sample player and some 
bouncing heads acting as volume indicators.

     The menu is in two parts the first part is some controllable 
DOC type 3d balls. A large 4 plane scroller runs along the bottom 
of the screen and into the bottom border. When you press space 
the balls fade away and you can then select 1 of 10 screens using 
a mouse pointer similar to the one found on the hidden screen of 
the Union demo (tracking mouse).

SCREEN

1.   Doc dots. some very straight forward controllable dots. A 
     large 1 plane scrolline in the background. I have seen this 
     type of screen so often that it hardly is worth mentioning.

2.   Megascroller 2. this screen is absolutely identical to the  
     megascroller screen in the Cuddly Demos by TCB. True it does 
     extend into the top and bottom border but it does not have a
     sample like the TCB. Come on guys if you get any more 
     similar you may as well join TCB!!!

3.   Crazystar. This screen has a lot of stars in it, and I do 
     mean a lot. On top of that it has some 3d balls very similar 
     to those on the TCB 3d Doc screen. Oh and a scroller too!!

4.   Odd Dragon. one of the most boring screens on the demo. Just
     a chequer board with a dragons head and tail moving over it.
     A logo wobbles a bit at the top and a scroll at the bottom.
     This was probably a space filler.(I had them too.!!!)

5.   Celestial Spiral. Without a shadow of a doubt the best 
     screen on this demo. It is a really excellent fullscreen,
     featuring a massive 2 plane scroller, a 1 plane disting 
     sign, and loadsa stars. This is an extremely impressive 
     screen if you are a programmer and if you aren't then it 
     looks pretty good anyway.

6.   Maxiballs. This screen is identical to the main menu of the
     TCB Whattaheck copy part demo. ie big controllable balls.
     And basically that is what it is ... Balls.. its crap.

7.   Tetradist. This one grows on you. I started off thinking it
     was boring but it does contain some interesting sprite 
     effects and quite a nice disting and wobbling scroller.

8.   BOF. yet again this screen is exactly the same as one from 
     Cuddly Demos. Originality is a key word Overlanders perhaps 
     you should remember that. If you are going to copy something
     you should at least add to it.

9.   The 3D demo. Some quite nice 2 plane 3d solid vectors. They 
     are not amazingly fast but the starfield on this screen is 
     the best thing. Its centre of perspective moves with the 
     object. Unfortunately they have only done 4 objects in the 
     demo. Still their loss is my gain!!!!!

10.  The Horror picture show. Starfield, 4 track music, scroller,
     and pictures of the Overlanders. AAAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!
     Horrific indeed.!

Reset.    Well someone has finally taken up The Carebears 
     challenge on who can do the most sprites in one vbl. Now up 
     to 136!!


Conclusion:-

     This demo is in parts very nice and in other parts it is 
absolutely diabolical. The Overlanders could really do with a few 
more original ideas.Having said that they are without doubt 
talented programmers, and on some screens they have really done a 
good job.
     Without being modest, I don't think that this demo is as 
good as The MindBomb demo as Stan Mercury seemed to indicate but 
it does come the closest that I have yet seen.

     The Delirious Demo II is my Demo of the month for the good 
bits in it and I would recommend that it is worthwhile adding to 
your collection.
