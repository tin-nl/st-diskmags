                    The Geneva ST "Scene?"            
                   
                     an exclusive report 
                     by our correspondent 
                   Oliver Wagner (Maulwurf)

Just  imagine  yourself  standing  on  the romantic "Lake Geneva" 
shore,  looking out  into the sun  setting over the horizon. What 
would you think about ? Your girlfriend which is sitting at home, 
knitting a warm,  woollen scarf and looking  anxiously out of the 
window for a sign of life from you ?  Are you even thinking about 
the Atari  shares which have (hopefully) risen in Geneva's grand, 
if minuscule Stock Exchange ? Or  are you even  more romantically 
thinking about the next time you will be absolutely pissed out of 
your brain (you what ????)? Nowhere  near, I  fooled you all. The 
most obvious answer to this  diabolically simple question is : Do 
the Swiss-Romanic  inhabitants of Geneva know the ST or have they 
ever heard about it ?

There  have  been  many a sleepless  night,  when  I  was  having 
nightmares about this question. But judge yourself, as I tell you 
part of Maulwurf's perilous quest through the streets of Geneva.

                   **************************

Having  newly arrived in the proud city of Geneva about one  year 
ago,  Maulwurf was still filled with youthful enthusiasm.  Having 
left  Kingston-upon-Thames (near the magnificent city  of  London 
(for  all  you  non-initiated)) he was  rather  used  to  British 
circumstances,  where the ST is widely used and available. Now if 
you don't agree on this,  then read on as Maulwurf will give  the 
doubters something to compare his statement with.  Coming back to 
his problem,  he took it upon himself to find a few retailers  of 
the Atari.  If you seem perplexed about me talking about "a  few" 
shops you must realize that dear old Maulwurf was still confident 
about  succeeding  in his task.  

But read on in this merry tale which turns constantly darker.  If 
you  have  a map of Geneva let Maulwurf take it,  add it  to  his 
inventory  and  let him consult it as often as possible  (to  all 
those non-Geneva addicts without a map :  tough luck, it's not my 
problem).  What should Maulwurf take next ?  A sword (not allowed 
under  Swiss regulation (a Kalashnikov assault rifle is  allowed, 
though)),  a few disks with PD-Programs on them, a toilet bowl or 
a barfbag (particularly useful after having  downed several pints 
of local Cardinal beer). Well, for the problem at hand, a diskbox 
with  contents would seem to be the wisest choice,  if you  don't 
want Maulwurf to  end up in a Swiss high security jail (once  in, 
you don't come out, I've been told). Having taken the disks and a 
lot  of  money (Swiss francs preferably)  for  in-between-search-
stops to fill up his fast depleting alcohol-level, Maulwurf makes 
his  way  to the next bus stop which is situated at the  far  SW-
corner of his map in "Rue de Berne".  There he takes the number 2 
bus going in the direction of "Genäve-Plage". Now let  providence 
guide him,  but if on the other hand you want him to arrive  safe 
and sound, let the better qualified bus-driver take the steering-
wheel  instead.  Once arrived at the "Bel-Air" bus stop  (on  the 
main  shopping  road),  Maulwurf gets off... and for  five  whole 
minutes stands gawking around in a perplexed manner. Oh, it's not 
what you think :  he hasn't lost his wits.  He sees Gucci  shops, 
Rolex and Omega,  Lacoste, Benetton, Cristian Dior and many other 
expensive shops,  but where has our cheap ST gone to ?  I know  ! 
He's  scared of all the Amigas,  PC's and Mac's that  haunt  this 
city.  No  fear,  little  one.  The "NEW AND IMPROVED  LOST  BOYS 
MINDBOMB-DEMO" will soon show these little upstarts what you  are 
really made off. After avoiding another obstacle in the form of a 
stray  lap-top  (Watch  out,   Granma,  here  comes  a  lap-top), 
Maulwurf's  heart soon takes a leap into the air  (literally)  as 
his  eyes  spy an advert,  pasted deceivingly hidden  in  a  dark 
corner of Geneva's main shopping avenue :  the Atari Logo  slowly 
creeps into view,  takes a peek here and there and shyly  decides 
to defy all those mean and dastardly graffiti sprayers.  The  sun 
comes  out and the birds start to sing as Maulwurf happily  makes 
his  way  through the crowd,  to carry on with  his  mindboggling 
search  for the missing,  presumed dead ST.  He decides  to  quit 
looking in this posh area and arrives at the solution that is  is 
best  to  take  the next bus across the  "Mont  Blanc"-Bridge  to 
continue his search elsewhere.

- Go west 
  
  You  can't  go  that way (What a f...ing great way  to begin an 
  adventure!)

- Go North 
  
  You  are walking along  "Place de la  Fusterie"  (remember,  we   
  speak French in Geneva!)  
  You are now standing at the busstop,  waiting for the No.6 bus, 
  to take you to the railway-station "Cornavin".  The bus arrives 
  and  you  get on.  While sitting in your  rather  uncomfortable 
  chair,  you reflect on your misspend youth (getting soft in the 
  head  are  we  now (by  which  I  mean  philosophical)).  While 
  reflecting,  the bus comes to an abrupt halt and two  8-footers 
  (well,   they  look   like it) in  TPG  (the  Public  Transport   
  Geneva) uniforms with truncheons in hand quickly get on.  Since 
  you are still lost in thought,  you don't  notice how  everyone   
  takes  out  their tickets  and  obediently  shows  it  to  them   
  (emiting   small  submitting  noises  while  their  tickets are   
  suspiciously  checked).  Suddenly an icecold hand creeps  along   
  your  neck and (no, it's not your girlfriend) willing  or  not,   
  you have to look up. Your eyes follow the buttons of the jacket   
  right up to a devilishly smiling face, with equally  diabolical  
  eyes. A  voice  which seems to come from deep within  asks  you 
  about your ticket,  which you obviously forgot as it is not  in   
  your inventory. As soon as you whisper about your forgetfulness   
  you  are whipped out of your seat and while one conductor (must   
  be brothers of Ceaucescu) holds you, the other one batters  his   
  poor stick  unconscious on your head.  Well, there's a  lot  of  
  work today for the overstressed truncheon and no rest  for  the   
  wicked .....


  Well, my dear readers. This is it for today, as I still have to 
  do my German  homework which  is a  fucking great chunk of work 
  (at least three hours worth).
  If  any  of  you   out  there  are  still  interested  in   the 
  continuation  of this unique piece wait for the next  issue  of 
  "DISK-MAGGIE" (same place,  same time,  same story)   when  the 
  story of Maulwurf's Quest will continue. Will he live ? Will he   
  have  another drink ?  Will he escape the clutches of the  evil 
  professor and his two henchmen ?  And last but not least,  will 
  he find his beloved ST ? 
  
  Till then brother-adventurers.  Keep biting those  fingernails.
                 
                   It's Maulwurf (O.W.) signing off.
