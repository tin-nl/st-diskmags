        ONE DAY WHILE DIALLING RANDOM NUMBERS INTO MY TELEPHONE 
        I HAPPENED TO DIAL ONE PARTICULAR NUMBER (3*##œ$, THERES
        YOUR CHANCE MR HAYES - I'LL EVEN TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE
         BASED IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND !!)
        
THE FOLLOWING IS A TRANSCRIPTION OF THE CONVERSATION THAT FOLLOWED :-

TELEPHONE : Bring Bring...    Bring Bring...  etc
 
N.O. : Hello 'Hoo Flung DUNGs Not so Chinese restaurant'
       can I help you ?
        
MAGGIE :  No its not you Lying Bastard thats New Order HQ ain't it ?
       (I Was just guessing - really !!!)
 
N.O. : O.K. Guv it's a fair cop !!!!!!
 
MAGGIE :  No I'm not Bob Hayes you Idiot, I just want an interview with
       you guys for Issue #2 of a fab new disk magazine thats just 
       been released - MAGGIE : .
      
N.O. : Wowzers I don't think we've got a (Pirate) copy of that yet
 
MAGGIE :  By the way who am I talking to ?
 
N.O. : Captain Napalm, and two of the other members are here as well,
       The CAMEL and Blade.
        
MAGGIE :  OK then lets get on with the usual interview shit then,
       When was New Order formed ?

N.O. : Around Christmas '89

MAGGIE :  What exactly does the group do ?
 
N.O. : We produce Compact Menus, and we are currently working on a demo

MAGGIE :  (Oh no not another sample demo)
       Why do you do this ?

N.O. : We're only in for the money guv !!! It's true I read it in 
       ST Format Ha Ha Ha !!! No but really we were disgruntled with
       the quality of software for the price, not to mention the 
       damage some protection systems does our nice drive heads (Yuk)
       It's got to be a rip off the way games are 25 quid a throw, I
       mean it's not as though it's the programmers or even the software
       house that gets the money, so when the software houses complain 
       about loosing money to piracy, they should merely increase the 
       cost to the distributors, it's these bastards that are making all
       the money, and keeping prices high. 
       We know for a fact that shops can buy software from distributors
       at 50 percent discount and have free delivery the next day, any
       where in England... Now who are the Pirates !!!
       Their main argument is that every copy made of a game deprives the
       company of one sale. This is complete Bollox !! If those stupid
       Prats think that I would have really bought all of allmost the
       1000 !!! titles that we have (Wots this free publicity) between us
       they've got to be joking. 99 percent of it is complete shit, and 
       probably isn't worth the price of a blank disk - Yeah a cheap one
       at that.
       We do have originals, of games and stuff, which we consider to be
       worth the money, and which we have bought even though we have 
       copies freely available, these include DevpacST ver 2, only the 
       best, Carrier Command, Good documentation and a great game,
       and several other sim titles with decent manuals and depth of
       gameplay.

MAGGIE :  Wow, I thought this was an interview, not a piracy debate, but that
       does explain your motives, and it's obviously a cause you're firmly 
       committed to. Recently I hear that there have been a few shake ups
       in the group, could you let us have some more details on this ?

N.O. : Yes certainly, originally we started out as me Captain Napalm doing
       graphix, The Camel coding the menus, With The Bald Eagle compiling it
       all together. All our software came from Derek MD and Becky.
       About a month ago Aquaman joined us, he doesn't really do much in the 
       production of disks but instead sends us more stuff, and knows MMM who 
       writes some code for us, and our latest recruit is Blade.
       Now Derek MD and Becky have left us, and TBE was planning to leave
       because of the amount of time taken up producing the disks, he 
       has remained, but now the disks will be produced by me, with the
       Camel still coding and Blade helping out on the packing and cracking
       side.
