Ha ha ha got you again!!!! A file with GURLS in HUGE LETTERS, what 
is  it?  some  rude  piccys,  in  fact the one  about  the  Danish 
housewife,  and  the  6ft  male model with his large  fruit  salad 
assortment ( or meat n` two veg,  or lions roaring....) or the two 
nurses and the industrial suction machine? ?!!!!?????!!!!!

Well 
no it isnt you sick pervy and probably leather clad  people, 
come round my place for a beating! gasp pant!  Oh my god Let that 
slip too early in the relationship..  Dont worry, this will settle 
down  in  a minute.  Anyway computers and GIRLS, three things to 
note,  1) dont bother,  2) forget it, 3) Just dont even think it,, 
ok?  anyway  it  has  been established beyond doubt,  females  and 
computers do not mix under any circumstances.

Consider  it  logically (Mr Spock) the following  conversation  is 
impossible.
---------------THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE---------------------------------
" Oh Tracey, you are a totally dab hand at F29 Retaliator, and you 
know  ALL  the hidden screens on the  Bugblatter  megademo,,  your 
knowledge of raster screenscan interrupts is unparallelled and 
pisses  on  everyone  elses  puny  efforts.(Goes  down  on  bended 
knee...) Please marry me...

---------------END OF IMPOSSIBLE BIT------------------------------

Thank you once again Douglas Adams, the cheque is in the post..

Anyway,  it  is  said  there  ARE female  programmers,  but  Anita 
Sinclair apart,  these tend to work in the BIG COMPUTER end of the 
business with names such as IBM,  ICL,  COBOL,  MICROSOFT,  to set 
your head spinning, they are strictly PROFESSIONAL people who turn 
off their machines at the end of a working day to go home to, well 
home for a start, Megademos, Dungeonmaster hints `n tips etc leave 
them  cold,  and  they would certainly not be doing this  sort  of 
article (on a Sunday evening on a ropey ST keyboard.)

The  preceding  deals  with the professional  careerwoman,  it  is 
therefore  the case that the average teenage/young female is  even 
LESS   interested  in  the  whole  shooting-match.   They  can  be 
interested in a whole range of alternatives from, say how nice the 
most  expensive shoes are,  or how nice Jason Donovans body is  in 
close  proximity  to   theirs, (eeurg!)
   or  at  a  different  level,   the  allegorical  nature  of  WM 
Shakespeares characterisation of Romeo & Juliet...(Phew!!!!)  None 
of the above involve computers, apart from JAYSE`S SHITTY RECORDS.

It  follows  therefore  that  it is  impossible  to  impress  with 
computertalk  or a demonstration.  The ST has a particular problem 
in that its diskdrive produces some impressively antisocial random 
noises  when  in  operation,  I am talking particularly  of  later 
series  ST`s  with  the  1meg drive,  I am  talking  Upper  Thames 
Regional  farting  champion just-warming-up sort of  noises,  when 
taken in conjunction with a romantic evening with a technical bias 
can  knacker it completely and leave to accusations  of  excessive 
freebasing of curry-related products by the annoyed female party.

-------------TOP TEN WORST CHAT-UP LINES--------------------------

1.  I`ve  got  am  AMIGA (capital letters of course as  all  AMIGA 
OWNERS are like that.)

2. I only wet the bed when I`ve had too much to drink...

3. I don`t do too many drugs anymore...

4. I own a Computer...

5. So what`s it like being the daughter of a mafia chief...

6.  My  psychiatrist was`nt too sure about me leaving the hospital 
this early...

7. I`m heavily into assembly language programming..

8. Do I pay you for it now or afterwards??

9. How would you feel about a HIV positive boyfriend???

10. Errmm...(this space free for advertising purposes)


As you can see from the above,  computers come in at numbers 1, 4, 
and  7 respectively.  This gives some idea as to the scale of the 
problem...The  only  way to succeed in a romantic situation  is  to 
feign  ignorance  of  the  whole subject,  but this  can  be  very 
difficult if at home......

------------------SECOND CONVERSATIONAL BIT-----------------------

"What`s that?? yes it does look like a computer, OH MY GOD WHO PUT 
THAT  IN  MY  BEDROOM!!  THAT LITTLE  BROTHER/SISTER/PET  GOLDFISH 
(delete  where  applicable) IS HISTORY AND ALSO TO BE  PART  OF  A 
MAJOR CONSIGNMENT TO THE SAUSAGE AND MEAT PIE FACTORY!!!!!!!
FETCH ME MY XL/90 20mm CHAIN GUN (TM) WITH OPTIONAL  RADIOCASSETTE 
PLAYER AT ONCE!!!!!!

---------------------------FINIS-----------------------------------

An OTT solution to a difficult problem....

The  other major battleground of the sexes is when a  computer  is 
purchased  in  the  middle  of what  was  otherwise  a  reasonable 
marriage,  in  these  sort  of  cases the hubby  (Yes  always  the 
husband!) comes home with something deceptively innocuous, such as 
a  ZX  Spectrum bargain bucket box,  or more lately,  the good ol` 
Atari ST packaged in attractive retail concept  sort of  packaging 
which  is to be henceforth a quiet,  (haha) educational,  (hahaha) 
and  productive  (HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!) new hobby,  nothing  frivolous 
like gamesplaying OH NONONONO..  Well just a little go at the free 
Jedi   Knight  destroyer  simulator  that  came  free   with   the 
machine....

                                   .............THREE HOURS LATER

" DAMMIT WOMAN I DO NOT WANT FOOD,TELEVISION,OR AN `EARLY NIGHT, I 
AM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRD LEVEL!!"

This  level  of interest expands until they are as hooked  as  the 
rest  of  us,  divorce proceedings are usually initiated upon  the 
husbands  attempts  to finance a hard drive and laser  printer  by 
selling  the baby to an spare human organs dealer.

In  conclusion,  the best way to suceed with GURLS is to sell  the 
computer,  have major plastic facial surgery, retinal replacements 
etc,  in  case your computer-owning mates (whom you do not see any 
more of course..) spot you in the street, and also have all system 
and  coding knowledge expunged (lovely word!) from your  brain  in 
case  some chance remark about say,programming the internal  sound 
chip  should crop up when you think you are safely established  in 
your new computer-free lifestyle. HAPPY HUNTING.

In  conclusion part II (eh??),  I may be wrong on this one,  there 
may  be  people who combine heavy programming with a  sweet  young 
thing by their side, Tracey may be able to fly all the missions on 
F29  Retaliator,  but  this  does  not seem  likely,  if  you  are 
fortunate  in  this  respect  do tell  us  and  your  experiences, 
problems  etc, as a guide for the rest of us proto-trainspotters..
