                         by Sammy Joe of TLB               

This  section here deals with demos which have not been  released 
yet.  I  will always try to tell you as much as possible  on  the 
demos. As far as I know there aren't that many new demos that 
have been announced. Here we go again:


SYNTAX TERROR DEMO

This is basically the real UNION Demo II mainly by Delta Force 
with screens by Tex, TCB, TLB, TGE and many other good coders. 
The disk will also contain 2 great fully playable games. THIS IS 
THE DEMO I AM DESPERATELY WAITING FOR FOR.


AUTOMATION DEMO

What ?  A demo by Automation ?  Yes,  you have heard right, these 
corrupted  guys are producing a demo.  As I was told the demo  is 
going to be a mega big one,  we are talking about a multiple disk 
demo. The demo will hopefully feature screens by all its members. 


NASA's 2ND DEMO

As I was just notified by the graphic artist of NASA I am here to 
tell  you  that  they  are  working  on  another  demo  which  is 
supposedly a lot better than the 1st one. This demo is definitely 
another one to look out for.


SUBHUMANS IN TURKEY'S PISS PLAPS DEMO II

This  is the follow up to their great 1st porn demo or  should  I 
rather say game ? This follow up will contain many more sequences 
for you to wobble you joystick around. DEFINITELY looking forward 
to seeing this demo.


BULLETIN BOARDS DEMO

This demo is not yet for certain, but that guys who is planning 
to  do this demo is trying to get a screen from all  the  various 
bulletin boards (no certain quality required)  and then put  them 
together.


A DEMO BY THE NEPALM SOLDIERS

This  is a group from Finland and they are working on  their  1st 
demo. I have already seen a preview of one of their screens which 
looks all right. They are intending to get their demo finished by
the end of the summer. 
 

                THE SECOND "ON THE LOOKOUT"
                          by Stad from Erasure
                          
Here are my latest news on the demos of my friends.. Let's start 
with THE AXE SORCERERS a demo group which was anciently named The 
Rams Collectors (there is less members now and they've all (mostly)
changed their pseudos). They're preparing a few demos. The 1st one is
called te goldo demo they're working on it since 2 weeks (we're the 
10th of June when I write) and this demo should take 4 disks!! and 
will contain at least 2 megas of sampled sound!!

And, another less ambitious project : a compil of screens with some 
screens of their friends (I don't know the name yet). And, Diamon told
me that they were preparing another one.. to make it work you should
add something in front on the screenand it should give a nice effect. 
Diamon didn't want to tell me what this fucking thing was.. but it's 
not microchips.. They told me that all this demo will be ready in ap-
-proximately one month because as they always say "‡a nous prends la 
tete!!" (french expression). they're planning of relising all the demos 
on the same day.    

Let's talk of AXIOM now. Their ancient name was Federation as
always it's a demo/utilities group.. They're preparing a demo
I don't know the name of it. I think that the demo should mostly
consist of Amiga and Quartet soundtracked musics (but aminly Amiga 
ones). More on this demo in the next issue.

The BUSHWACKERS are preparing a second compil of Automation' 
screens. It shouldn't be ready soon simply because The Sergeant 
had only (for the moment) six new intros of Automation.. The 1st 
compil should be available from the TLB PD-Library as I sent it to 
Sammy Joe. The Trans-Beauce demo will be released by them also at 
their demo-party (or after) in July. I don't know if "Trans-Beauce" 
is the final name of this demo. 

And finally STARMAN AND SCOTT who are preparing a soundtracker demo. 
All the musics are coming from the Amiga and are original compositions. 
Starman send me a preview of it and it really looks good. The demo will 
take two disks and should be released quite soon. 

Okay, that's all for this time..


DEMOS WHICH WERE ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE LAST ISSUE:


THE NEW CAREBEARS DEMO ( I don't know the name yet)

When the Carebears finished their Cuddly Demos,  they  said:  "No 
more  demos".  It  doesn't look like they are going to  stick  to 
that.  When Manikin went to Germany to visit Thalion, Nick of TCB 
already  had a few new screens written for their new demo.  I  do 
not  know  what the screens are,  but apparently  they  beat  the 
living  daylights  out of the Mindbomb demo (I  personally  can't 
believe that the screens are that good, I'll believe Manikin when 
I have seen the screens myself). 
Anyway, this demo is definitely one to look out for.


THE PHALEON DEMO (put together by some geezer from Marseille)

This is the first demo organized by the frogs (don't take it  too 
personal).  This  demo will not just feature screens by the 
Replicants,there  will also be screens by Chuck the Fox,Lost Boys
and  TCB,  not to forget to mention that the main menu is by  the 
Replicants and that  they also do the protection.  The demo  will 
come on 2 disks. By the looks of it,  it appears to be  a  second 
Union Demo but a lot better!!!!!!!!!!


ANOTHER DISK MAGGIE BY TLB

You should know what it will contain, so no explanations.


THE OVERLANDERS EUROPEAN DEMO

This is another demo in which crews from all over the world  take 
part.  We have told the Overlanders that we might also be doing a 
screen  for their demo,  which at the moment is very unlikely  as 
Manikin  is having a break (he also has to work for  his  exams). 
But  the  demo has screen from other  groups  like  Sync,  Omega, 
Pendragons and many other very good groups.  (Sorry that we could 
not do a screen guys!!).


THE INNER CIRCLE DEMO

The  Inner Circle are a bunch of English guys who formed a  group 
lately,  they consist of Dynamic Duo, Fingerbobs, ST Squad, Griff 
of the Resistance,  Electronic Images, I think that these are all 
the members,  but do not blame me if I missed anyone).  This demo 
will  not  be as good as The Mindbomb Demo or the  new  Carebears 
Demo,  but it is definitely another one to look out for.  I  have 
seen  a screen for this demo produced by the Fingerbobs and  this 
screen is very good.  I have just seen some more screens for this 
demo, they consist of quartet tunes, some nice sprites and loadsa 
other good stuff.


THE ALLIANCE DEMO II  (from France)

This  is  another  demo  produced,   this  time  mainly  by   the 
Overlanders.  Quoting Stan Mercury,  "Our demo looks pretty  damn 
good  already." It seems that there is nothing else to say  about 
this demo.

 
CONSTELLATION DEMO III

The  only thing I know about this demo is that it is their  third 
demo and that it is due to be released in Summer.


ST CONNEXION'S DREAM DEMO

This demo is due in July.


SEWER SOFTS SOUND TRACKER

A  sound tracker written by Sewer Soft from  Australia,  I  don't 
know if it is PD or what, no idea!!!


That's about it with the demos due to be released.  If I'll  find 
out about any more demos, I'll notify you. 

This  here stays the same as it is  probably still true !!!! 

P.S.:    Skunk is probably coding another Sample demo right now.
P.P.S.:  Oh damn, I just about forgot that it is very likely that 
         the  Overlanders  are producing another  one  of  their 
         Menus. Keep up the good work guys, great menus.
