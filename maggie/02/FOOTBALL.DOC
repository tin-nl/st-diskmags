     Michael  the  German persuaded me to write  an  article  for 
their disk maggie ( the best disk maggie he said ) ,  the writing 
of the article is not the problem,  but what should I write about 
is.  My  first idea was an article about the LOST BOYS and how  I 
met them, but that has  1: Has been done before and  
                        2: Would be very boring 
So I had to think of another idea.

     Then it struck me ( well my mum did for not tidying my room) 
a  subject  close to all our hearts,  the greatest sport  in  the 
world,

       YES IT'S WORLD CUP TIME AGAIN, AND DON'T WE ALL LOVE IT.
     
     The date today is Saturday,  June 23'rd ,  and for those who 
do not know it is the start of the second round of the WORLD  CUP 
finales   with   Cameroon  verses   Colombia   in   Naples,   and 
Czechoslovakia verses Costa Rica in Bari.   
     For the few people who do not know,  very few I  hope,  when 
England kick the shit  out of Belgium we will be playing   either 
Cameroon  or  Colombia in the quarter finales ( all  of  you  who 
didn't   listen  to  your  geography  teacher  Cameroon   is   in 
North/Central Africa and Colombia is in South America ).
     This  is getting very boring and I need my breakfast so  I'm 
going now but will be back later ................................

..............................Well I'm back, it's now 10:20 pm on 
the 23rd of June and England will be in the semifinals for   sure 
after Cameroon beating Columbia  2:1  and having 4 vital  players 
out   of   the  England  game.   Unfortunately   we   will   meet 
Czechoslovakia , West Germany or Holland in the semifinals.
     If you have not heard ( you should have done by now )  Brian 
Robson  will not be playing any more games in this world cup  due 
to his injury .

     Now a quick flash-back,
          who was/is the greatest footballer in the world :

     Bobby Moore, England;

       Voted player of the tournament when England won  the  1966 
World cup, despite his lack of pace he always seemed to be in the 
write  place  at the write time.  His great sense of  humour  was 
shown  brilliantly when he often introduced teem mates  by  other 
names to F.A. (Football Association) officials.

     Pele, Brazil;

       There  is only one word that can describe this  genius  of 
football,  amazing. A very famous quote from the former Brazilian 
team  manager  said  that  " If you asked me  who  was  the  best 
footballer  in Brazil I would say Pele.  If you asked me who  was 
the best winger,  I would say Pele,  and if you asked me who  was 
the  best goalkeeper,  I would have to say Pele.  He is  like  no 
other footballer."  After this the former manager was locked  up 
because  he  was clearly mad and never even knew  which  position 
Pele played.

     Johan Cruyff, Holland;

       What a magnificent player but unfortunate not to bring the 
World  cup to Holand in the 1974 finals in West  Germany.  Cruyff 
was a strong and mobile player,  with fast reactions and  amazing 
control,  he  was famed for being able to turn even the  greatest 
defenders  with ease.  Even the West German coach Dettmar  Cramer 
lickened  Cruyff to Pele 20 years earlier being far ahead of  his 
time.

     Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany;

        He is now the present manager of the West  German  squad, 
often  better  known  as  the Kaiser,  when  he  played  for  his 
International team as captain. He often seemed to be very casual, 
but if trouble loomed he could change gear and change a desperate 
situation into a winning move.  In his 12 year career at the  top 
he played 103 times for his country and was captain of their 1974 
World  cup  winning side against Holland.Sevvy  Ballesteros  once 
said that " I played golf the way Beckenbauer played football for 
West Germany.  Close to perfect.  " ( But I have never seen Sevvy 
kick a golf ball off a tee. )

     Last and by all means least 
      Deigo " Handy " Maradona, Argentina;

        What a hand and what a man,  Deigo has an uncanny ability 
to deceive a referee into thinking he used his head when he  uses 
his hand.  But putting that aside he is one of the best  football 
players in the world at the moment, some people now think that he 
is  an even better player than Pele,  but Pele was not  a  cheat. 
Bobby Robson said that " With Maradona,  even Arsenal would  have 
won the World cup. " It must be said that he is probably the most 
skilful player at this time but not even he could match the great 
skills of Pele.

     So to sum up my order of merit is as follows :-

               1) Pele, Brazil.
               2) Johan Cruyff, Holland.
               3) Diego Maradona, Argentina.
               4) Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany.
               5) Bobby Moore, England.

          Apologies  for my spelling because I am very  tired  at 
          the moment and need my sleep.

                   Enjoy the rest of the maggie,
