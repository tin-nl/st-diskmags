                              by John and Sammy Joe

As we had the best joke in the last issue and that joke took  the 
micky out of the Amiga we decided to copy down all the Anti Amiga 
jokes we know.  It is not that we do not like the Amiga, but then 
again  you gotta take the piss out of something.  If you know  of 
any Amiga Jokes that we have not got in here,  please write to us 
so  we  get add them for the third or fourth issue (if  there  is 
ever going to be one!!!).Anyway, here are the jokes....

1. Whats the difference  between a pair of knickers and  a  room     
   full of Amiga owners...
   The Knickers only have one cunt inside.

2. Why can't Amiga owners eat pickles...
   Their heads are too big to fit in the jar.

3. Whats the difference between a Boeing 747 and an Amiga...
   You know for sure that the Amiga is going to crash.

4. How do you get an Amiga to scroll smoothly...
   Put it on a conveyor belt.

5. Whats the difference between an Amiga and a Spectrum...
   Ones got crap sound,  crap graphix,  and a terrible  keyboard, 
   the other ones a Spectrum.

6. Man - Have you got a Space Bar for my Amiga...
   Shopkeeper - Hmmm seems like a fair swap.

7. Did you know that if you take the word Amiga add a few letters
   and take a few away you get the word CRAP

8. Why did the Amiga owner cross the road...
   Because his Skoda had broken down.

9. Doctor Doctor, I feel like an Amiga...
   What a jerk haw, haw, haw.

10. Whats the defenition of a hardware virus...
    An Amiga.

11. What has an Amiga in common with a hedgehog ?
    Nobody wants to touch it.
 
Well that about exhausts my supply of humour for the  moment,  my 
tape has just finished, and it's 2:38 in the morning... 
I'm going to bed...
