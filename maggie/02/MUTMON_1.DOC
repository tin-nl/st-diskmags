Welcome  to the first edition of MUTANT MONTHLY.Why is it  called 
that?I  here you ask(go on ask me!).Well the reason is (wait  for 
it)  that  it is done by THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA  TURTLES  which 
consists  of  two main members:DONATELLO (that's me  folks!)  and 
MICHAELANGELO.There is another sort of member:THE LARCH (or as we 
call  him:THE  DICK HEAD)but all he does is  sit  around  playing 
FALCON  (that's  his  latest game you  know)and  HOSTAGES  so  he 
doesn't  really  count.We are just about to embark on  our  first 
demo  which will take us about fifty seven seconds to finish  and 
will  be really crap (you have to start somewhere  ).Well  that's 
enough  idol chit chat,lets get down to business.Before  I  start 
though there are I few things I would like you to know:

1.All members of TTMNT are English.
2.While writing this I will stay completely sober.
3.If  this is put in MAGGIE then you know that TLB are  extremely 
desperate to fill up space.
4.I haven't the faintest idea what I'm going to write about.
Right then , now we have got that out of the way I can begin.

                           Hints and tips.

TV Troubles.

First  tip  of  this issue comes from an  amazingly  hansome  and 
brilliant  person  called DONATELLO and it is on the  subject  of 
TV's.If you have your ST linked up to a TV then you know that you 
can't  use your computer too much before your eyes begin  to  get 
sore.There is a solution though.

When  you use your ST wear sunglasses.This doesn't help much  but 
it does make you look like a complete dick!


Xenon II.

If you have been having trouble trying to complete this excellent 
game  by  the  Bitmap  Brothers then  never  fear,the  answer  is 
here!After many long hours of playing this game ,  I have found a 
solution that will ensure certain success.If you shoot all enemys 
and avoid crashing into anything then you will complete Xenon  II 
with ease.


Strider.

MICHAELANGELO  has  descovered that if you hold down  the  TAB  , 
CONTROL  ,SHIFT ,  ALTERNATE and CAPS LOCK and type in "I  am  so 
feeble  at  this  game  that  I  can't  even  complete  it"  then 
absolutely nothing happens!

NOTE:  After  the sunglasses tip ,I went and had a break  and  in 
that  time something weird has happened to my WP so if  when  you 
read this it looks a bit funny then don't blame me!

Well  then ,  on with the hints and tips section I  think,wait  a 
minute, my mum's saying something.Oh,Czechaslovakia (that must be 
spelt wrong) have just scored against the U.S.A.  in their  World 
cup  match.That makes the score 1-0 to the Czechs.I'm pissed  off 
with doing hints and tips anyway.Lets do something else.


                       The World Cup

Did you know that the football players are banned from having sex 
during  the World Cup?When they score they will only be aloud  to 
kiss each other!The only thing I want to say is that I creased up 
when Diego "Scorer of a goal that was a handball against  England 
in  the  1986  World  cup  which  made  Argentinia  win  2-1  and 
enevitablely win the World cup it's self" Maradonna and his  team 
lost to Cameroon 1-0.What a laugh!!

Well  now I'm pissed of with this subject as well and I  think  I 
will stop writing.My mum has just informed me that the Czechs are 
now winning 3-0 against the U.S.A. and they are only five minutes 
into the second half!

All  it  remains  for me to do is to give you  loads  of  useless 
information and this issue of MUTANT MONTHLY will be complete.

                          Sneezed:Twice(My ST is now coverd with 
                                 greenys).
