                         by Michael Schuessler

As  you  probably all know,  I am not very good at  machine  code 
programming and Manikin is very busy I am not able to explain the 
assembler routine on the disk (but I will try to tell you what it 
actually does!!).

As you have probably already guessed it has something to do  with 
the  keys Alternate and Help.  Did you ever get pissed  off  when 
there was a game with a really good picture which you can't get ? 
That problem is nor solved.  Assemble the program on the disk and 
then  run it.  After that you must run the game and  by  pressing 
alternate help the picture will be saved to disk. 

The program has been written by one of our great french contacts. 
The source code is documeted in the frog language.  It shoudl  be 
pretty simple for people who are used to machine code to work out 
what it does and then to alter it (if there are the needs!!!). 
 
I  think  that  that's about all that I have to  say  about  this 
feature, except that I personally found it veru useful !!! 
THANKS man and keep up the good work.

If  anybody  has  something else that you think  might  be  quite 
useful  to others,  send it to us along with an  article,  thanks 
again.
