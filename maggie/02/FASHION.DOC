This  article is about one of the really strange letters we  have 
received in our fan mail.

One  normal  Wednesday lunch time I (SPAZ) arrived home  at  LOST 
BOYS HQ to find a big package waiting for me.  As i looked at the 
package  I  noticed  something strange,  it was  addressed  to  a 
MR.T.L.BOYS.  I carefully opened it up and found there was a  not 
inside saying we owed somebody œ19.50,  as I got further into the 
packet  I found it contained this disgusting statue thing  and  a 
letter, the letter said :-


                    THE GOLDEN AGE OF FASHION
                            COLLECTION.

Dear Private Collector,

Most true romantics long to be in Paris in the spring.  Now Paris 
-  personified by the delectable Francoise - has come right  into 
your  life,  to remind you of those sunny,  golden years  of  the 
Belle Epoque.

FRANCOISE.

The  lovely  Francoise was inspired by this 1913  Fashion  Plate, 
illustrating  a  grey-green taffeta dress with linen  collar  and 
cuffs,   satin  gilet  and  enamel  buttons.   A  Certifcate   of 
Authenticity,  signed  by  Madame  Delpierre  of  the  Museum  of 
Fashion  and Costume,  Paris,  guarantees that the  figurine  was 
chosen by the Museum as an outstanding example of the fashion  of 
the period.

A TOUCH OF ELEGANCE.

A French fashion writer once said, "The elegant person should not 
wear  anything  conspicuous  or extreme.  She  will  avoid  crude 
colours,  heavy perfumes, excessive gestures and strong words." I 
am  sure  you will agree that Francoise,  reborn  in  traditional 
hand-painted  porcelain,  exactly expresses that  sentiment.  She 
will  certainly  bring  an air of old  fashioned  refinement  and 
french elegance into your home.

YOUR PRIORITY APPLICATION HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.

Francoise  has  been sent to you on FREE  APPROVAL,  so  you  can 
decide for yourself whether or not she is to your taste.  If  you 
decide  to  keep her,  simply choose your  method  of  payment(by 
cheque  or credit card),  and return it with our invoice  in  the 
envelope  provided.  This  will entitle you  to  further  fashion 
figurines in this exclusive collection.

NEXT MONTH.

If you would like a partner for Francoise to make a classic pair, 
you  will  absolutely  adore next month's  collector's  choice  - 
Dominique, a vision in soft blue tiered velvet.
Remember that the figurines in this collection are always sent ON 
APPROVAL.  You are never under any obligation to buy.  So if  you 
ever decide not to collect one after all,  just mark the  invoice 
"Please Cancel" and return to us the figurine BY REGISTERED POST, 
and there will be nothing to pay.

Yours sincerely,

Julia Hunter
Secretary, Fashion Collection.


At the end of all that I couldn't stop laughing,  SAMMY JOE  also 
found  it  very funny and that's why we decided to show  you  the 
letter that we received.
