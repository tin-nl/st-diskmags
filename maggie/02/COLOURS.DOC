  HOW TO BUGGER ABOUT WITH STOS TO GET SOME NICE PALETTE SPLITS
  -------------------------------------------------------------

Written  by that stupid bugger (I was going to put  bastard,  but 
there  is  no need for swearing) from the WATCHMEN who  does  all 
those stupid basic demos.

As you're reading this it is obvious that Sammy Joe thought  this 
text was worth putting into the Lost Boys disk maggie (Hi guys!)

Many  people that use STOS (The few!) have tried to  write  demos 
with it, I admit I have as well, and although it's crap for speed 
you can (with a little trickery) get quite good results. Over the 
last  few months I have been writing the BIG STOS DEMO (The  good 
one,  written by myself and THE SKUNK,  not the crap one!) people 
who  were stupid enough to buy it or unforturnate enough  to  see 
it,  will see that I managed to get some reasonably good  results 
without the need for any machine code routines.

At the ATARI '90 show a few people didn't believe that you  could 
split  the palette directly from STOS.  The way STOS is  written, 
any attempt to turn timer B (the horizontal blank timer) on  will 
result in the program panicing wildly and eventually finishing in 
a  small jibbering heap.  However,  it is possible to  split  the 
colours with a little thought.

The WAIT VBL command will stop execution of the program until the 
electron  gun  hits the top of the screen.  With this and  a  few 
timed  FOR  NEXT  loops we can trace the electron  gun  down  the 
screen;

10      WAIT VBL                ; WAIT FOR TOP OF SCREEN
20      FOR I=1 TO 300:NEXT I   ; WASTE SOME TIME
30      DOKE $FF8240,$700       ; CHANGE THE BACKGROUND COLOUR
40      FOR I=1 TO 300:NEXT I   ; WASTE MORE TIME
50      DOKE $FF8240,$000       ; CHANGE BACKGROUND COLOUR AGAIN
60      GOTO 10                 ; REPEAT AGAIN

This program MUST be compiled other wise it won't run fast enough 
to work correctly. The first FOR NEXT loop will waste enough time 
to  let  the electron gun get down to around the  middle  of  the 
screen.  The program then changes the first colour register  (the 
background  colour) to $700 (red),  the next FOR NEXT loop  waits 
again and changes the colour back to back ($000),  the final GOTO 
makes  sure that the routine runs every blank.  The result  is  a 
palette  split  halfway down the screen.  You  can  increase  the 
number  counted to in the loop to increase the  distance  between 
the  splits,  likewise  you can add more colour changes  via  the 
colour registers (for complete idiots below is a map of them!)

$FF8240         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 0 (BACKGROUND COLOUR)
$FF8242         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 1 
$FF8244         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 2
$FF8246         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 3 
$FF8248         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 4 
$FF824A         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 5      
$FF824C         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 6 
$FF824E         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 7 
$FF8250         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 8 
$FF8252         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 9 
$FF8254         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 10 
$FF8256         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 11 
$FF8258         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 12 
$FF825A         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 13 
$FF825C         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 14 
$FF825E         COLOUR PALETTE REGISTER 15 

The  program has to change the colour registor directly  as  STOS 
only  changes  colours  at the start of  every  blank,  which  is 
useless  to  us.  If you run the program you will find  that  the 
split is jumpy, this I'm afraid can't be helped, so you will have 
to play around with the loop count to get the best results.

Anyway,  I never intended to write this much on such a nausiating 
subject, I can see you're bored stiff so I'll finish now...
