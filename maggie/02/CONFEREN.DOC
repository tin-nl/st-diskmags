                                   by Sammy Hagar

A conference line, what is it ? As the name already tells you, it 
is used for holding a conference on the telephone.  That does not 
tell you much more does it ?  Ah well,  basically there are about 
10  people  on the phone and each one of them talks at  the  same 
time,  in  other  words it is a total chaos but it is  great  fun 
anyway.  At one conference line I tried to type along in order to 
give you some idea on what you talk about. 

A big THANKS GOES TO SHERY OF THE ST AMIGOS FROM THE  REPLICANTS 
FOR HAVING PHONED ME.  So here we go....

Well,  currently I am on a conference line with Derek MD, Phil of 
BBC, Scott Simpson,  Sparky, Becky and Wizpop. At the moment I am 
told  how good the mag is and everybody is slagging Stampede  off 
and telling me how crap it is. Everybody is telling D MD how lasy 
he is (I agree!!!).  Only crap talk at the moment, so here's some 
information:  The line was setup by Scott Simpson and then  taken 
over by the ST AMIGOS. 

By the way,  the line has now been on for 3 hours and people  are 
still talking like mad.  At the moment we are thinking of phoning 
the  Empire,  but decided not to.  As Phil is so desperate for  a 
girl  Scott  has  decided  to get one on the  line  for  him  and 
suddenly  out  nowhere the lovely voice of a girl  called  Sandy 
shatters to my end of the phone.  Phil, speechless, tries to chat 
her up but others interrupt him and try there luck !! No luck for 
any one of them, now it is my turn. "Hi Sandy "... "Hi Mike, houw 
are ya ? "...." I'm fine and you ? "......" Do whaat ?".... Never 
mind"....(Ah  well,  that  was  my chance).   One  thing  is  for 
certain, Sandy likes laughing 'cause she giggles all the time, it 
is rather funny or should I say sweet ? At the moment she appears 
to  be  the one who keeps the line going.  Now we are on  to  our 
favourite  TV  program and Derek has just decided that  he  looks 
like  JR from Dallas (I think that that is the  overstatement  of 
the  century !!!!,  Derek looks even worse !!!!!) as Sandy  likes 
Dallas.  Here comes the so called chaos,  everybody is talking at 
the same time,  god,  that's confusing trying to keep up with the 
typing !!!!  By the way, that's what it looks like when everybody 
talks    at   the   same   time    "SYOBTSOLERATSEBNIEHTEDIWDLROW 
LDFBIDJGHJ".  When  I came on line Shery of the ST  Amigos  just 
left,  she  said that she will be back in half an hour but  she's 
not back yet and it is over 30 minutes are up already....

Boring crap talk again.....Sandy is 20 years old and has  decided 
to  call Derek granddad now.  Sandy sounds lovely....  Sandy  was 
asked  to  write an article on the best  bonking  positions  with 
Scott and she has agreed !!(So hopefully she will, anyway, if you 
Sandy are reading this here at he moment,  get typing if you have 
not  started yet !!!!  Now we are talking on Chinese  food  cause 
Derek likes that... I just had it confirmed again that Sandy will 
write an article....

It  is quite again....Boring.....The phone is  ringing  again.... 
Nothing is happening again....Sandy says that D MD is a .......(I
think that the line went funny did not it Derek ???)
and everybody laughs !!!

         We  now  have  decided to talk in  German,  now  we  are 
thinking of phoning somebody,  but we just can't think of whom to 
phone.  Now  we are trying to phone Hotline again,  Jim  was  not 
there,  He is scatching his balls(or something like that)..... We 
now have some guy from Hotline on the phone, it is DES.

Has anybody seen the porn film Debbie Does Dallas ?   Well I have 
!!!!  Phil and I are waiting to get Animal Farm of Derek  MD.  As 
Italy  is playing their game at the moment the  conversation  has 
now switched to football....  Shery should be back soon as I was 
just told !!! As my fingers are really hurting at the moment I
will stop for a moment to commentate this conference line.

Back again and the subject now is videos,  somebody asks what the 
latest releases are ?  The question is,  WHO HAS PRETTY WOMAN  ?I 
personally would not mind to go and take a piss (ahh,  that feels 
better) !!  We have just decided that Long Play on video machines 
is crap as you loose too much sound and picture !!!! Does antbody 
want any Disney Films ?  Phil does not like soccer,  but he likes 
playing rugby (especially when girls are watching !!!). As I have 
said  earlier on,  Italy are playing one of these countries  that 
are impossible to pronounce,  just thought that I should tell you 
that the final score is 2:0 for the guys from Spagetti Land. I am 
about to leave this line now,  so,  cherio guys and hope to speak 
to you again in the future......

A  MEGA  HI GOES AGAIN TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK  PART  IN  THIS 
CONFERENCE LINE.
