
       THE USUAL PART II along with THE BIG MOAN BY SPAZ

                              by the lovely handsome German 
                              with the sweet name "Sammy Joe" 

I  really do not know why I am sitting here and working  my 
butt  of to get this second Issue finished on time  !!!!  Well  I 
suppose  that it must have something to do with all the guys  who 
actually  wrote to us and did send us some articles  !!!!  A  big 
thanks goes to all these guys. Also I would like to thank all the 
people  who wrote to us telling us about bugs or even  what  they 
thought about the magazine !!  Thanks also goes to the people who 
wrote  to  us and asked whether they could  write  some  articles 
(in  fact  there  were a few !!!!!).  Up to now  we  had  to  ask 
most of the people to write some articles  for  Maggie and not 
many of them wanted to (but that will hopefully change) !

Now,  we  have managed it again to get enough articles  for  this 
Issue but there is something much more important,  we are looking 
for people to CODE INTROS FOR US.  SO IF YOU CAN CODE  REASONABLE 
WELL,  PLEASE  CODE  AND  INTRO  FOR  US,  IT  WOULD  BE  GREATLY 
APPRECIATED. 

Currently  when  I am writing this we have about 400  K  of  pure 
unpacked text data files on the disk.  We also have 50 K of musix 
on  the disk but we might have to take some off depending on  the 
amout of space on the disk that is left. 

This issue contains various graphix by 3 artists. Again as in the 
last  issue there is are some graphix by Spaz of TLB,  Thomas  of 
SYNC (change here: his graphix will be used in the 3rd Issue!!!)
and WIZPOP from the Medway Boys.

SO,  JUST  TO REPEAT IT AGAIN,  WE NEED PEOPLE TO CODE INTROS  OR 
WRITE SOME ARTICLES. If you want to write an article use any word 
processor and save the document as an ASCII file.  If you do  not 
know  what  kind of articles you could write here's what  we  are 
very short off:  Hardware reviews,  Utility reviews, show reviews 
from other countries like Germany,  America,  France or any other 
country and basically whatever else you think other people  might 
find interesting.

Also,  we have started another section, it is the adverts. If you 
have  anything that you would like to sell,  write to us tell  us 
exactly what it is and how much you want for it. 

Also,  if  you  run  your own company we do ask you  to  send  us 
previews  of your games so that we can put them on the  disk.  If 
you  want to advertise a game,  send us a screenshot and we  will 
include it. 

The  things  you  send us will always go into  the  next  issue, 
whatever it may be. So please send us lodsa things...

As far as I know this magazine has worldwide readers. Our readers 
are  from countries like  :  America,  Canada,  France,  Germany, 
Sweden,  Finland,  Ireland,  Italy,  Luxembourg  (ULM),  Iceland, 
Australia and many many other countries.  In other words we  have 
enough publicity.  Herewith I would like to say a big high to all 
the people who read this bullshit.

That's it for this Issue

     Yours sincerely 

                   Sammy Joe (Chief Editor)


          

                       The B.I.G. Moan.

                             by
    
                      SPAZ and SAMMY JOE.


This article is a BIG moan to get some people to stop writting to 
us with stupid questions, it is not ment to hurt anyones feelings,
it's just to make it easier for us to answer peoples letters.  As 
we  are getting so many letters we just have not got the time  to 
answer  all  of  them as we are coding  demos,  writing  our  own 
magazine and running a PD library (without making any profit!!).

The  first thing is when you write to us could you please include
a  self  addressed envolope ( with a stamp ),  if you don't it is 
very     likely    that    we     will    not     answer     your 
letter. If  you  are  in a famous group or you  have  written  an 
article for maggie you will not have to send us a stamp !!!! 
You see, today we spent over EIGHT  BLOODY  POUNDS sending out
letters to  people  who  didn't include an SAE.

Another thing if you are going to start trying to do  compilation 
menus don't write to us saying "please,  please, please could you 
help  us,  we  are trying to write compilation  menus  could  you 
please give us some help as we can not code ". So far we have had 
loads  of  letters like this and we just don't have the  time  to 
answer  all  the questions,  if you want help buy a book  or  our 
source code and get reading, that's what we did!!!!!!

If  you do buy any source code or any      PD      disks       of 
us and you  decide  to send  a cheque or postal order DO NOT and
I mean DO NOT WRITE  IT OUT TO THE LOST BOYS,  SPAZ, SAMMY JOE OR
MANIKIN write it out to MICHAEL SCHUESSLER.

If you write to us and send us discs could you please put a  demo 
or  something  on the disc that we could add to our  PD  library, 
this way we get all the new demos quite quickly.  WE  HATE IT  IF 
PEOPLE SEND US BLANK DISKS !!!!!!!


THIS ARTICLE IS NOT MENT FOR ANYONE HOW ALREADY WRITES TO US ON A 
REGULAR BASIS  (FRIENDS AND CONTACTS (THEY SHOULD KNOW  WHO  THEY 
ARE).

THAT'S IT FOR THIS MONTHS MOAN,

                    SAMMY JOE AND SPAZ OF TLB
