                                   By Michael Schuessler

The Defcon demo. This is the second sample demo by the Watchmen 
from England.  Their first demo was the New Order Sample demo and 
now  they  have come up with a much better one  although  it  has 
quite a few problems in itself. 

You  insert the disk and it quickly begins to load BUT your  hope 
of  the demo loading is quickly destroyed by the red colour  that 
the  screen has turned to now and that the drive  has  stopped!!! 
What that basically means that there a loading error has  occured 
!!  This error happened to me a few times more.  It appears as if 
they have the touchiest loader of the century.  But luckyly after 
the  few  tries the demo continued loading.  While  the  loading, 
which  in  fact is very very slow,  there is a  scroller  on  the 
screen which is a so called byte-bender.  What that means is that 
it bounces up and down and that it describes curves.  The font (I 
think) is the one originally used by the Carebears (isn't it hard 
to  write  an  article without mentioning  their  name  ?).  Then 
scroller  will  inform  you  about the  demo  and  various  other 
bullshit.  When  it has stopped loading you are asked to press  a 
key ([up to now you only had to wait about half a century]).

After  you  have  pressed the key some kind of a  coka  cola  can 
appears  on  the screen/ This can roles around its own  axis  for 
another  century.  In case you have not  managed to read what  it 
says  on  the  can  I will be so  kind  and  help  you,  it  says 
DEPACKING.   When  it has finally depacked we get to  the  actual 
demo. 

THE SAMPLE DEMO
I am not quite sure in what order the bits and bobs appear on the 
screen  so  do not blame if I get it wrong.  (The  reason  why  I 
probably  cannot remember is that it is 11.30 pm and I have  just 
come home from the pub and I am still suffering from the 4  pints 
of snake bite black that I had there). Well, first of all you get 
this  picture of the acid face,  but luckyly it bleeds (  I  hate 
acid musix). As this is an ACID sample demo, we should not forget 
the sample,  as Spaz of TLb would say,  the sample is all  right, 
but I personally reckon thatt he sample is very good (at least  a 
lot  better  than samples from other demos that I have  heard  ao 
far!!!).    The sample, as the name says features DEFCON. Anyway, 
after  the sample has started and the picture has come up on  the 
screen  a  scroller appears at the bottom.  If you read  it  long 
enough you will see that the Watchmen great the Lost Boys as  one 
of  the first people (Thanks a lot guys !!!!!).  The demo is  not 
finished yet, there are many scrollers in the background, most of 
them go at a different speed (you know hat I mean,  don't you ?). 
The  acid  face  changes  to a  sign  which  stands  for  nuclear 
destruction. These two sign always change in between the demo. 

I think that that's about it with the demo,  so here again is  my 
summary:

Name                          : DEFCON demo

My Opinion:  Although this demo takes ages to get started I would 
count it to the sample demos which definitely go into my  private 
collection !!!!
