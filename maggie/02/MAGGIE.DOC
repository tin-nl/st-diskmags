
It's 2:21, I can't sleep, I'm out of Coke, there's nothin' on the 
TV (it's a bit normal at 2:23),  nothin' to eat (except a strange 
form  which is supposed to be a pizza) and just at the moment  my 
brother (an Amstrad freak...) enters my room and asked me : "lend 
me  a  book,  I  must go to  the  toilet".  Well,  sometimes  I'm 
wondering why am I still living ? Except fucking the Overlamers I 
can't see anything which provides me any fun...or  perhaps...yes, 
just a few things... 

Perhaps  are  you wondering what this article is dealing  with  ? 
Well, I don't know too ! As I can't sleep I just decided to write 
something  for  the  magazine in case Sammy Joe  find  some  free 
sectors after having packed all the other articles.  I don't know 
how long this text will be,  what it will deal with,  who will be 
fucked in it...eh...no,  the Overlamers will certainly be  fucked 
in it but it's the only thing I can say about what is  following. 
Be carefull ! It's certainly gonna be very boring so read it only 
if  you don't have anything else to do !  The only guys who  will 
certainly  read  it are me and Sammy Joe for  correcting  all  my 
English  mistakes  (good  luck Michael...a  German  correcting  a 
French...).  Well,  let's  talk about the Overlamers (I told  you 
that it will be very boring) : these guys are the biggest mother-
suckers-fuckers ever assholed on the Earth (hey Michael  !  Don't 
make any censure on my text !).  The only Overlamer who's quite a 
nice  guy is Ziggi Stardust,  all the others  are...Overlamers  ! 
Some  people  are certainly wondering why I so  much  hate  these 
guys. Do you want to know why I hate them ? Do you really want to 
know why ?  Hmmm ?  You want it ?  Well,  I wont tell  you.  (All 
reclamations  can be sent to TLB,  12 Cambridge  RD,  Teddington, 
MIDDX, TW11 8DR, Soviet Union). 

Now that I've made my ritual anti-Overlamer-campaign, I can go on 
with...eh...well, who knows...

What about describing you what I'm actually seeing from my chair?
What ?  You were waiting that from the beginning ? Oh, then let's 
go :  I'm sitting on a chair,  wearing a drawer and a T-shirt,  I 
only have my right shoe (I don't know where the fuckin' left  one 
is),  in front of me are my TV,  about one hundred disks full  of 
cracked  games,  demos...,  my electronic calculator (an HP 28  S 
(yeah)),  an Amiga 1000 (below the TV),  my ST, 3 Posso boxes, my 
video  player (with the pizza above it (the more I look  it,  the 
more  I'm  wondering where does this pizza come  from  ?)),  some 
original games (?!) :  STOS (no ! no ! I was offered it !), Xenon 
II (it was supposed to be NeXT's first crack but the fuckin' disk 
crashed),  Sub battle,  Maxi bourse and Leavin' Teramis.  From my 
chair  I can also see my jeans on the floor,  my Reebocks on  the 
edge of the window (because of the smell),  my printer broken  by 
Snake's fuckin' external drive (I walked on the drive's cable and 
it felt on my printer (and Snake's fuckin' reaction was to say  : 
"hope  my  drive still work so that we can  continue  making  the 
copies...")),  my  desktop with a lot of books above it that  I'm 
supposed  to read for preparing my exams (in  2  days...),  lotsa 
magazines  (ST  mag,   Tilt,   Playboy,  Science  and  Life,  The 
Economist,  TV programms,  etc...) all around the room,  about 50 
empty  bottles of Coke (really !),  my lovely armchair (for  long 
thoughts...), and finally my bed somwhere under the disks...

Well,  all this is quite interesting no ? I'm sure even Sammy Joe 
has stopped reading this article,  so why am I still writing ?! I 
don't  know...oh  !  I  know  why !  I must add  a  fuck  to  the 
Overlamers : fuck you Overlamers ! It's actually 3:19 and I began 
this  article  at...(just let me have a look at the  top  of  the 
file)...2:21  !  One hour for writing something that no one  will 
ever read !  And for sure when I'll try to save the file the disk 
will  crash...just have a try.........I was sure that there  will 
be a problem :  There was no room on the disk to save the file  ! 
Well, it's a big problem coz' I don't have any formatted disk and 
if  I want to format one I must leave the word-processor and  the 
article will be lost ! Let me think (any suggestions are welcome)
..........3:25...............Yeah !  I can erase a file from  the 
disk and then have some place free to save the article on !  What 
a clever guy I am !  Marvellous ZAE !  Fantastic ZAE ! Megamighty 
ZAE,  Wizz genus ZAE !  O.K.,  have another try now...Wow !  Well 
done ! The file is saved ! I think I can go back to bed now, this 
text  was so boring that I'm feeling myself to sleep  until  next 
summer,  who  knows :  if tommorow I can't sleep again then  I'll 
perhaps write another article...

Bye and fuck to the Overlamers ! 

Fuck !  The article is now too long to be resaved !  I must erase 
another file... Bye again (and fuck to the Overlamers again) !
