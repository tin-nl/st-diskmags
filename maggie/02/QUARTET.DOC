This program is the best four track editor I have seen, it comes 
on three disks and has three main programs. 
The main program is the editor, this I found to be realy good and 
contained all the right notes and rests, one thing I did miss was 
that it didn't contain any triplets, but other wise it's realy 
good. The features that I did find quite useful were the midi 
compatability ,the way you could swap voices every other note, 
the fact you could change the sample frequency, and finaly the 
way you could play all four channels at once via a midi-keyboard.
Things I didn't like in the main Quartet program where the way it 
changed the tempo of a song when you started to load a voice set 
and then decided not to, and the way it didn't like voices in a 
voice set that were longer than thirty kb where as the other 
programs did.

The next program is digital, this program enables you to convert 
samples to any sample rate, it also enables you to change the 
pitch of the sample ,once this is done you can save it as an .AVR 
format sample for use in QUARTET. This program can also be used 
to convert samples from the amiga so that they sound good on the 
ST. It also has some good filters which enable you take the bass 
treble, and hi noises from your samples.
One thing I found bad was that you could only convert samples 
smaller than forty kb on a half meg  and fifty kb on a meg.

The final program is called voices, this program allows you to 
make up your own voices sets to use with QUARTET. The voice sets 
can contain up to 20 different samples at any frequency between 
4khz and 16khz. This editor is very good except it takes a long 
time to draw out the sample wave.

On the disks there are also lots of samples which rob povey got 
off me, the samples are all off the amiga and all sound realy 
good, there is also source code for playing quartet music files 
which can be used in your own programs.

I think this program is well worth buying. You can see we like it 
because we use it alot, or we will be using it alot in our next 
demo.
