Oh  god,  what  has the world come to nowadays ?  You  even  need 
somebody to tell you what to do in the demos...

Anyway,  with  this  article I will try to inform you  of  hidden 
screens  keys  you can press and whatever else is  worth  knowing 
about demos.


Let's start with the Mindbomb demo,  as I said in the last  issue 
that their is a hidden screen I have to tell you now that this is 
not true,  sorry guys !!!!  But have you found the hidden article 
in  the last issue yet ?  If you have not,  here's a small  hint, 
click  with both mouse button at the same time on the number  239 
on the disk in the left had corner of the menu picture.  You will 
then  have to answer a few more questions to show that  you  have 
read the articles !!!!


THE HEMBROIDS GEN 4 DEMO

Apparently this demo contains a hidden screen, I personally could 
not activate it as my disk was corrupted.  I was told that if you 
type  HMD  when the screen goes black and you are asked  to  type 
something in you will enter the hidden screen.


THE ULTIMATE GFA DEMO (UGD)

While  the presentation ( I am not quite sure what was  meant  by 
this)  you  must enter MAGICMAD in order to get another  mad  max 
tune. 
When  you  are on the main menu,  enter OVR and you will  get  an 
extra screen (along with somebody's address!!!!). 
On  the  screen Vectorballs 3,  if you enter STAN  you  will  get 
another excellent 3D balls shape !!!
If anybody has found any more hidden keys in the demos could  you 
please inform me, thanks !!
