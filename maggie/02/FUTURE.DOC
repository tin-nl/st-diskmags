This excellent demo was written by myself and Harvey Lodder,  you 
know  the one who takes the piss out of the STE just  because  he 
doesn't own one.    If you remember back to the last Disk  Maggie 
you  will remember he took the piss out of me on  the  telephone, 
well this is what Harvey does on the phone:-
ring, ring, ring

Paul   :  Hello
Harvey :  Hello Paul, Harvey
Paul   :   No I think  you have the wrong number, my name is Paul 
          Brennan, and not Paul Harvey.
Harvey  :   Stop being stupid!   Is it alright if the present  me 
          comes round for 10 minutes?
Paul   :   I'm  sorry  Harvey,  I don't allow stupid 21 year olds 
          with mad cows disease in my house!
Harvey :  Oh **** off
Paul   :   Yes,  of course it's alright for you to come round for 
          10 minutes.
Harvey :  O.K. I'll be round in a short while.
Paul   :  Bye
clunk

The when he comes round he spend the whole 4 hours( you notice he 
said 10 minutes on the phone) saying things like 'Hungry, Hungry, 
Hungry' and 'Headache,  Headache, Headache' and 'Will the present 
you  make the present me a cup of tea?' and other  stupid  things 
that stupid 21 year olds with mad cows disease say!

Well  enough  about  that,  I'm  supposed  to  be  reviewing  our 
marvellous demo

It will run on a 520 or above,  ST or STE,  and you get  animated 
digitised  pictures with a 1040 or above.   The demo  includes  a 
load of digi pics from Back to the Future and Back to the  Future 
II,  along with a racy piece of sample from the film.   This demo 
never ends and if you leave it on for about 3 hours you will want 
to burn the disk!!

This demo was our first joint demo and was released at the 16 bit 
computer fair.   It was put down a bit by one PD company,  saying 
is it just a load of pictures and a sample?  But the same  person 
has  released a demo with just One picture and a  sample,  so  he 
can't really talk....

As this demo has just been released you probably won't see it  on 
any  of the PD lists but I know a very good PD company that  will 
have a copy of the demo.   If you want a copy then you can get it 
from the Lost Boys PD library.
