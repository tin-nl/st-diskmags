And a great vision did appear before Adam as a pile or rotting
carrots. And amidst the carrots stood the holy apple tree, and lo 
the apple tree did not rot. And from the holy apple tree came a 
low and resonant voice. The voice of Our Lord God.

Our Lord God spoke unto Adam saying, "Here me Adam. Why are thou
so sad. I giveth you flowers, grass, cockroaches and trees and
why do you persist in shaking your penis with your right hand?"

Adam did bow unto God and weep "O Lord, I am all alone. I have 
nobody, no friends and no sex life."

"What? I giveth you cockroaches." exclamied our Lord God.

And Adam didst reply, "Father, I need somebody! I need a woman so 
that I may need not to wank all over your lush green grass."

Our Lord God didst say, "This is true. I shall give you a female 
companion. But thou shall not have full intercourse, for it has 
not been written that I shall have a grandchild."

Adam fell to his knees and said unto Our Lord God, "So it be true 
that you are my father?"

Our Lord God did elaborate this by saying unto Adam, "Yes. I am
your Lord God father. And I shall grant you a female companion."

Adam did say unto his Father, "But if this be true that I cannot 
have a son, then who be my mother so that I may be your son?"

Our Lord God was puzzled by this, and he spoke unto Adam saying 
"Adam, you need not have a mother? I am the Lord God and I 
created you."

Adam rubbed his penis and replied, "O Lord, I shall then be a 
bastard son to my Lord God. A son with no mother. How can this be 
my father? Are you a virgin?"

The Lord God didst answer in a very pissed off tone of voice, 
"Thou little shit cannot speak to me like that? I created you and 
you are my son. If thou cannot handle this, then thou my as well 
fuck off."

"O Father," replied Adam, "Do thou still grant me a woman to do 
with as I please?"

And Our Lord God didst say in all his anger, "Speaketh not of sin 
my son. I created you from one of my ribs, and thou shall be 
granted a female companion who shall be your sister, from another 
of my ribs."

Adam did reply in a concerned voice, "O Lord Father. Would thou 
be with BUPA if thou is having a rib removed?"

Our Lord God was again puzzled by this and didst reply, "I need 
not BUPA to remove one of my ribs. I am the Lord God and thou are 
my son. I can do what I want. If I want to my son."

"Thy words are truly holy O Lord, but thou would be well advised 
apply to BUPA if thou were to reomveth one of thy ribs." said 
Adam.

Our Lord God who did reply in a stern voice, "Son, if thou wishes 
thateth, then it shall be done."

And the rotting carrots did fade away leaving the holy apple tree 
untouched. Adam did then plucketh a round object from the apple 
tree, leaving only one roundeth apple on thy tree. Adam did then
eat thy holy apple and then the secondeth apple was eaten by Adam
alone.

Adam did then throweth the holy apple core away and said unto the 
cockroaches, "Thy Lord God has no balls."
