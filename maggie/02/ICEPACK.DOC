
           ICE PACKER VERSION 2.1 BY AXE OF DELTA FORCE
                              by Sammy Joe of TLB

As I have just received a copy of this packer and it says in the
read me file that  it is in the Public Domain I have  decided  to 
put this packer in this Issue of Maggie.  I bet you wonder why  I 
am putting another packer on the disk when I just put  automation 
Packer 2.3r on the last Issue.  The answer is fairly  simple,  as 
the  read me file by AXE says,  this packer has quite 
a few  advantages to the Automation Packer.

Parts  of this document are just copied out of the read  me  file 
already  done  by AXE (you gotta make your  life  easier  somehow 
don't you?). Here are some of the things the packer can do. First 
of  all,  it  can pack files as any  other  packer.  Secondly  it 
already  has an improvement to the Automation  packer,  it  packs 
files  smaller  than the Aut.  Packer. The Ice  Packer  also 
decrunches  faster  than any other packer.  A great advantage 
this packer has is that it DOES run on hard disks. 

Message  to  AXE:  I HOPE THAT YOU DO NOT MIND  US  PUTTING  YOUR 
PACKER ON THIS 2ND ISSUE OF MAGGIE.  ANYWAY, AS IT IS PD I ASSUME 
THAT  IT IS ALL RIGHT, SO THANKS A LOT FOR A  GREAT  PACKER, THE 
BEST PACKER AROUND AT THE MOMENT. Thanks.

                                        Have a Byte,

                                                  Sammy Joe 

Oh, by the way Axe, could you please send us any updates so that 
we can use them and also put them on the disk magazine. Thanks 
again (this is the last one (hopefully !!!)).

The rest has been taken directly from the document on the disk.

This is what the packer can do:
- pack all files without errors (I hope!!!)
- crunch files smaller than Automation packer 2.31
- work on harddisks and ramdisks!!!
- pack several files in one go (FILE*.* or SHIT.*)
- Files are saved under the same name as the original.
- The Offset is set to the value with best results (which is $1528).
- Percentage is shown during packing.
- Time for packing is shown after packing.
- The packed file is checked for errors automatically (even though
  there won't be any. If there should ever occur an error, please 
  contact me!)
- The packed file is only saved if it is smaller than the original.
- The data may also be unpacked at an odd address.

Improvements for Version 1.1:
- Packing time was reduced.
Improvements for Version 1.11:
- Version 1.1 which I made in one night returned with a Verify-
  Error when a special combination of bytes appeared. Pack-Ice 
  now works fine again.
Improvements for Version 1.12:
- If you press Alternate during packing (while the number of
  remaining percent is decreased), the current file is left un-
  packed and the next file is packed.
Improvements for Version 1.13:
- Some executable files that were packed with Pack-Ice caused an 
  error on STE computers or very new TOS version. I never 
  realized that error, because I don't have any of those. Thanks
  to Jinx of FOF who spotted the error and told me about it.
Improvements for Version 1.14:
- Was (Not Was) found a bug in the packer. It has been removed.

Improvements for Version 2.00:
- Comfortable working with Pack-Ice is possible, because the 
  mouse is used.
- Fileselectbox: Select the path in which the file(s) which you
  want to pack are. If you select a filename, only this file is
  packed. If you select FILE*.*, then all files with this name 
  are packed. If you do not specify any filename, then all files
  in the current directory are packed.
- If you don't like working with mouse (or don't have one), then
  press the Alternate-key, while the program is loading.Then you
  can work with the old keyboard commands.
- If you compress pictures (Degas, Neochrome, Doodle, ...), you
  may want to use the additional algorithm for picture 
  compressing. It compresses screens to about 2 kB less. The un-
  packing for screens is done automatically with the normal 
  source (ice_unpa.s or ice_unp2.s).
  If a picture file is packed with the special algorithm,then P>
  is shown. If it is not in the correct format,then -> is shown,
  which indicates that the normal compression routine is used.
  If you never use this feature, you can kill the 15 marked lines
  of the  unpacking sources in your routines.
- Some files returned with "Data could not be packed". This only
  occured, if there were (somewhere in the file) more than 1038
  bytes in a sequence that could not be packed. I corrected this
  and files like Castle Master 2 should not make any problems
  anymore.
- Other changes in packing and unpacking source have been done.
  The old unpacking source is not compatible with the new one!
- With the source "ice_unpa.s", you can unpack data to whatever 
  address you like (e.g.: original address: $32345, target 
  address: $72213). Please check out that the target address is
  at least 120 ($78) bytes higher than the source address. 
  Otherwise, you might overwrite the original data.
- You do not need the packed length for unpacking anymore. You 
  just need to specify source and target address.
- The source "ice_unp2.s" will unpack every file onto itself. 
  The program needs 120 bytes of free memory for saving and 
  restoring data.

Improvements for Version 2.1:
- Unfortunately I have put some wrong sources into the Pack-
  Ice folder. Only the ice_unpa.s source worked correctly. Sorry 
  about that.
- the decrunch at an odd address wasn't possible in version 2.0

Improvements for Version 2.11:
- I got special wish, demanding an input for the offset. Here it is.

Have fun using this great packer!
