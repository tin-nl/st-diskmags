A  long time ago,  in a land far,  far away,  there once lived  a 
programmer.   This  programmer one day decided he would  write  a 
game,  with simple graphics,  but very good game play.  After six 
months of late nights and hard work,  he released his game.   The 
game  we  know as 'DEFENDER'.....   Some years later  some  other 
programmers got together and thought that they could improve both 
the  game  play  and  the  graphics.    After  a  year  of  these 
programmers being together they released a game with some awesome 
graphics and unbelievable game play.   The game we know as 'STAR 
RAY'....   After another year or two another group of programmers 
got  together  to do the impossible,  improve the game  play  and 
graphics again of Star Ray.  After only a short they released the 
best  Defender  style  game ever.      The game  that  they  call 
'ANARCHY'......

I  found this game very addictive,  although a little  hard  with 
things seeming to home in on you,  and if they miss,  they u-turn 
and  have  another  go!!!!    The Graphics  are  superb  and  the 
game play is even better.    I think that this game well never be 
beaten,  and  if  it  is,  it  will  be  a  remarkable  piece  of 
programming,  and  I would like to shake the programmers  hands!!  
So come on you programmers, there's a challenge for you.


The game has two different difficulties of play,  and you  choose 
which  one you want while the game plays you an execellent  piece 
of sampled sound.

The  only other thing I can say about the game is  buy  it!  This 
game  should rank with the best in your collection like SIM  CITY 
and  other  great pieces of work such as THE BACK TO  THE  FUTURE 
DEMO (plug! plug!).

Anyway now for the ratings...

GRAPHICS:           98%  Brillant!!!
SOUND:               1%  Only joking.
REAL SOUND RATING:  83%  Very Good.
PLAYABILITY:        96%  Brillant!!!

OVERALL:            98%  Meg-Brillant!!!


...And now a quick hi to Ashley 'Virgin' Griffin... HI! HI! HI!

...And remember, when Ashleys about it's time to Vote God...???
