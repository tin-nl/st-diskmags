            SIM CITY COMES ON A DOUBLE SIDED DISK...

With SIM CITY, take the destiny of the world's greatest cities in 
your hand. Build houses, streets, factories, airports, and a 
stadium. You will have to fight crime and pollution, collect 
taxes and balance your budget...

This is the advert that presents itself to you upon buying SIM 
CITY. It is your job to design and build a city of your choice 
which can be anything from a village to a metropolis. You start 
with a map of a bleak and barren landscape were you can pick any 
area you choose to build your slum. Every landscape has either a 
river running through it or around it.

Once you have choosen your site, it's time to build. You are 
presented with a series of icons which include houses, factories, 
commercial centres, roads, parks, power plants and various other 
things which enable you to design a concrete jungle of your 
wildest dreams. The first thing that you need to build is a power 
plant, then some houses, commercial centres, industrial zones 
then roads.

After a while, the SIMS (Simulated-Computer-Farties), will move 
in and you can then set your budget. If you set the budget too 
high the SIMS will move out, so it's best to increase it by 
around 1% each year. Once the SIMS have been living in your city 
for a few years and your concrete jungle has started to expand, 
they'll demand things like an airport, a stadium and a harbour. 
The SIMS seem to have a nasty habit of asking for things just 
when you've spend your last few dollars on parks or houses that 
will remain empty.

Another factor to take into account are police stations and the 
city's fire service. If you have neither of these, your city will 
start to fall apart, and after a couple of years it will have 
more than a passing resemblance to London!

SIM CITY also has several inbuilt games which set you various 
tasks as mayor, from rebuilding the city after an earthquake to 
cutting the crime problem. Other things that can hassle you in 
the game are disaters such as flooding, fires, plane crashes, a 
large green monster (I'm serious!!!) and tornados. But it's nice 
to see that the writers have given you the option of turning the 
disaters off.

So to sum it up, here are my ratings for SIM CITY and it's host 
of Simulated-Computer-Farties...

GRAPHICS:  70%  Nothing outstanding, but they do the job.
SOUND:     50%  A few spot effects.
APPEAL:    95%  It's brillant!!!
OVERALL:   90%  The sound and graphics may not be that good, but 
                it's a game that you'll never put down.


                      <<< Writers Plea! >>>

Can you please send me your cities on disk so that I can create a 
SIM CITY public domain domain disk. When you send your cities, 
can you also put on a READ.DOC describing a brief history of your 
city and it's problems! Hopefully, after a while I'll be able to 
release the disk into the P.D companies and you'll have your name 
and city in lights.

All disks will be returned, with at least one more city for you 
to use. Not bad, eh?
