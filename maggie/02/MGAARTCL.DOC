      By  AD. (of the Nordik Coders) and Tanis (Of The Carebears)
							


  Some time ago, An Cool called us up and informed us about a
forthcoming convention in a suburb to Stockholm called Ronninge 
(with two dots over the "o"). So we thought that we could at least  
get our hands on some fresh joysticks. 

  The reason why we were in need of joysticks was that one evening 
some time ago when we (AD, Tanis and T.A.K. (T.A.K. is an abbreviation 
we prefere not to translate)), were battling out on the supergame 
SUPERSPRINT, and the so far calm and relaxed evening, erupted into a 
riot where Tanis accidentely (sure!!!! We do all belive in Santa as 
well!!) broke and bended AD.'s revolting (according to Tanis) SLIK STIK.
  This of course called for a vengance from AD. Who with a little help 
from his dumbbell changed the look of Tanis' joystick (changed the look
is somewhat an underexeggeration, the remnants of the microswitches 
could be found in the backyard and in most corners of AD.'s appartment).

  Back to the main story. (If we keep on like this we will probably 
still be typing when school start again)... 
  We decided not to bring our computers to the party, except for 
An Cool and JAS. As usual An Cool had to show off with his Soundtracker. 
  We met up with JAS and a fellow called LINK (Judge LINK), at the 
central station. We took the train to Ronninge, during the trip, wich 
lasted about 30 minutes, we were involved in at least four fistfights 
with alcoholics, junkies and all sorts of strange people who tried to 
steal JAS's computer and since he ain't Mr Strongman Of The U.S. we had 
to help him out. (Quite an exageration actually, but what don't you do 
to keep a story exciting).
  Eventually the train stopped in Ronninge and we jumped out of it in 
a happy mood. After a short stroll along a railway, which caused a 
Deja Vu for AD., (Not really. It turned out to be some vague memories 
from the utterly mind numberling boring movie "Stand by me"), we had 
reached our destination which turned out to bea godforsaken school 
in the heart of the metropolis Ronninge. (a metropolis consisting 
of a Hot Dog Stand, a Pizzeria and a small grocery store, named 
PrisPricken). 
  At the main entrance of the school there were two poofie-looking 
guys from the lame crew Sphere, who wanted to charge us for 50 SEK!!! 
(Svenska enkronor). We then used the good old copyparty-trick 
called: 
  "Everybody-hide-in-JAS's-enourmus-bag-really-fast-and-then-JAS-pays-
50SEK-and-we-are-all-safely-in" (haven't you heard of it???)...
  
Well... So far, so good... (you know the rest Spaz!). 

  Well inside we met Anders (An Cool, for the ignorant), dressed in his
usual party outfit: blue ATARI pants, a t-shirt with the text: "An Cool
the master alive" (ti hi!!!) and a bag of buns (check out the 
interwiews!). An Cool who had got there earlier in the day showed us to
the room TCB occupied along with some Amiga-freaks and Monstret. We 
unpacked and sat down to watch some new Amiga-demos...
							
  Later on (about 3 secs, to be honest) the unused table in the back of 
the room had turned in to a bardisk and Monstret started serving 
tequila (you know, first salt then tequila and finally some lemon)... 
  Meanwhile Tanis and JAS were running around looking for an extension-
flex and they finally found that MegaCribb (of2Lifecrew) was trying 
very hard not to be seen, and of course JAS and Tanis brutally 
searched through his belongings and found a suitable cord exept for 
one "tiny" little detail, the jacket in the room was earthed
and unfortunately MegaCribb's cord wasn't. 
  So a few minor modifications were needed to make it fit into the 
jacket. The solution to this problem was JAS's Swiss army-knife and 
after about twenty minutes the connector fit nicely into the jacket, 
but now another problem had arised, it wouldn't stay there. So after 
a few pathetic tries the flex was returned to Cribb, who, for about 
twenty minutes, sat with a sad and gloomy look on his face looking at 
his trashed connector. 

  Now let's return to our tequila drinking friends who by now were 
drinking Danish elephant-beer which they had quite large quantities 
of since the TCB-Headquarter slowly had turned into a hidingplace for 
all the other crew's booze, because Anders had said:
  "Since we are TCB, they will never touch the booze in here".

  About ten minutes later the whole room was filled with 'Securitate' 
people (The arrangers of the convention had namely hired in their 
parents and other friends to check that no trouble occured. They 
were dressed in white T-shirts which said 'SECURITY' really big on 
their chests and backs. 
 Actually all that was missing were the Khaki colored shirts with 
little red bindings around the right overarm and a little black 
moustache.). These guys cleansed the room of booze and gave us the 
"reassuring" message that the Danish delicatesse should be returned 
to us after the convention...
 Now a certain person with the ability to persuade persons into doing 
certain things, used his talent to form an army of avengers who were 
running around the halls pouring out coca cola, shrimp cheese, 
ham cheese, An Cool's buns, pizza leftovers and anything else they 
could get their hands on. Everything just to make lives of the 
Securitate and the people who actually had to clean the rooms to a 
living hell. After this blitzkrieg Anders managed to drag away about 
100 persons from the convention so the only people remaining were a 
lot of brats and lamers...  

  This should be a lesson to all people who wants to arrange a 
convention in the future. 
A lot regulations just sabotages the true feeling of a convention. 
And to forbid the drinking of alcohol in the way that we have 
described in this exciting article is totally wrong. Just do it as 
we did on our convention in Stockholm (the fourth of August 1989), 
politely ask them to drink their brew outside... 
And if they refuses, simply smash their faces in!!!!
