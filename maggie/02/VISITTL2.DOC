		A VISIT TO THE TLB HQ PART II

Day Nine (Saturday, 14th April '90):

As  planned the getup time was four o'clock,  when the birds  are 
still asleep ...  as should be sensible people. The departure had 
been prolongued for another half an hour,  as I tried to talk  to 
Mike  about  the  amount of drink I had poured  into  me  without 
feeling the results.  Mike didn't take it kindly and  disappeared 
for  fifteen  minutes into the garden to take a few  lungfuls  of 
air. We also had to plot the quickest route towards Sherness. 
After arriving in Sherness (it was just dawning and the air still 
had a crisp freshness to it (by which I mean :  I was freezing my 
ass off)).  Although we had arrived a few minutes late, the ferry 
hadn't yet arrived.  So while nurishing ourselves on  "Maltesers" 
and  listening to "Lawnmower Deth" and "Die B”sen  Onkels"(Mike's 
favourites)  we stood outside in the cold.  For one hour  nothing 
happened,  but  then  the first  cars  started  appearing.  After 
another  half  hour,  the  bus we had been  waiting  for  finally 
arrived.  We waited till it had nearly arrived at the place where 
we  had  taken up position and waved frantically to  the  driver, 
signalling him to stop. Instead of instant recognition, there was 
only a timid smile and a stupid wave back by the driver  :  total 
miscomprehension of our signals. Feeling slightly taken aback, we 
immediately  entered  our vehicle and gave  chase.  After  nearly 
thirty  miles of a high-speed chase,  we had manoeuvered  into  a 
position to give the driver the unmistakeable sign to pull  over. 
The driver willingly obliged by pulling over at the next carpark, 
where  Mr.  Schussler  directly but politely inquired  about  the 
"encyclopaedia",  which promptly no one had ever heard about.  As 
it turned out,  we had stopped the wrong coach :  there had  been 
another one from exactly the same travelling company. Not all was 
lost yet though,  as the bus was supposed to come along the  same 
route we were on just now. After waiting for another five minutes 
the  other  coach  showed up and after  a  similar  manoeuver  we 
finally got the books.  By the way,  there was a German  swimming 
team aboard. How did you get on, lads ? 
Five  minutes after arriving back home we realized that one  book 
was missing ! Bad luck that. But it just couldn't be helped. 


Day Ten (Sunday, 15th April '90):

Sunday.  I had called my sister who is studying in London about a 
possible time to meet (I hadn't seen her since Christmas). It had 
been decided that sunday would be the best day,  since neither of 
us  would  be working.  After a quick  melancholic  visit  (which 
actually  took  most  of  the afternoon)  to  our  ex-next  door-
neighbours  for  Scottish cones and stories  from  Australia,  my 
sister  and me took the next train from Hampton Court Station  to 
Waterloo Station.  Once arrived we managed to catch a  connecting 
tube to Leicester Square from where we went to China Town.  There 
we  had a most enjoyable (cheers,  sister heart).  Afterwards  we 
went to the cinema and had a look at the latest  Stallone/Russell 
film  called "Tango and Cash".  What good fun this turned out  to 
be.   Badies   flying   through  their  windscreens   towards   a 
bespectacled  Stallone,  that  had one (seemingly)  smart  remark 
after another on his (seemingly) sarcastic tongue.  The rest  you 
can probably guess (blam,  blam,  blam !!). Although I must admit 
Stallone  had  a  certain style this time (he  killed  with  more 
vigour) and Russell I like anyway (he's got long hair,  just like 
I have !).  It was quite late afterwards so I had to stay with my 
sister the night.  As her own room is as small as a dog-kennel  I 
was  lucky  to get the room of someone that had just  moved  out. 
Like that I could at least move my toes. 


Day Eleven (Monday, 16th April '90):

Next  day there was the getting home (big deal,  sucker.  Get  on 
with  it as our dear reader hasn't got all day and  this  article 
will probably not fit in the magazine. The Ed.). 
Right,  Monday  consisted of a lot of work,  as I wrote two  game 
reviews  and  Mike  tested out the new  scanner  his  father  had 
bought.  These  two articles represent my first tries at  writing 
something constructive,  which somebody else will read apart from 
my  closest  friends.   I  hope,  the  difference  won't  be  too 
pronounced (I haven't changed a lot have I now ?).
In  the evening we had!  to go to another party at the  house  of 
another one of Mike's friends.  Sammy Joe seems to have a  rather 
selective memory as he had already forgotten the incident from  a 
few  days ago.  He (we) were happily buying wodka (for  him)  and 
cider  (for me).  As it turned out,  neither of us got a  lot  to 
drink this evening since all the people present seemed to be in a 
rather  thirsty mood.  In spite of Michael's desperate  tries  to 
hide  the wodka deep inside a fountain (which was situated  in  a 
patio),  none  of the potato-drink survived.  In the end we  went 
home (relatively) dry (sober). 


Day Twelve (Tuesday, 17th April '90):   

This  turned out to be another London  Day.  Mostly,  because  we 
wanted to go to Kensington Market. 
You must realize that Mike is THE fitness freak and the following 
most definitively was not my idea.  Just like that Sammy Joe  had 
one  of  his brilliant flashes of genius.  Out off  the  blue  he 
suddenly decided,  that he wanted to test if his quote formidable 
ability  unquote  to run continuously for  some  miles.  If  that 
doesn't sound too difficult to you,  it did to me.  As the  train 
would be leaving during the following ten minutes, we had to rush 
the  three  miles.  In spite off a defect in my knees  which  has 
affected  my running capability during the last four  years  (and 
effectively  stopped all my sporting activities during this  time 
and is still doing so now),  Mike and I just managed to catch the 
train.  
Once  arrived in London,  we took the tube to Kensington  Market. 
The  market  has been accommodated rather temporary  in  a  three 
storey building.  This temporary solution quietly underlines  the 
idea behind the store :  rent which isn't too high, with a lot of 
articles on little space,  relatively near to the City of London. 
As  the market consists of an infinite number of little shops  or 
stalls, it is possible to find almost all you are looking for. If 
you  are looking for something cheap to buy,  you  couldn't  have 
come  to a better place.  Most is second hand,  but some is  just 
stuff from last year which no Benetton freak would dare to  wear. 
Shoes, metal t-shirts, patches and other various accessories plus 
all  the  other  stuff  you  can  imagine  are  sometimes  rather 
precariously  stored full from  floor to ceiling. We both  struck 
some bargains,  as sometimes the vendors are willing to haggle  a 
bit, just for the fun of it.
In the evening another visit to the "Anglers" was waiting.


Day Thirteen (Wednesday, 18th April '90):

The only thing I will write for this day is the following :
Mike bought "Raw", a metal/rock magazine. It said this : 

                      ACID REIGN IN CONCERT 
                             Marquee
                     Thurday, 19th April 1990
                     The OBNOXIOUS 1990 TOUR
                     Doors Open : 7.30 p.m.
                         Price : œ 5.50

This just made our day.  As ACID REIGN is one of the best "Square 
Dance"  bands  around (their own statement)  we  were  absolutely 
flipped  when we read this,  as it meant that I would be  totally 
deafened two days before my departure back to Geneva. 


Day Fourteen (Thursday, 19th April '90):

After sleeping a bit longer,  we made our way to London.  It  was 
still  quite  early  (about three o'clock)  when  we  arrived  at 
Leicester Square. Unsuspecting we went along Tottenham Court Road 
and  came by the "Marquee".  There we were faced with  our  first 
real dilemma :  a long queue was already forming !  What where we 
supposed to do ? Go out and enjoy ourselves now, but arrive later 
and  don't be let in (the "Marquee" is quite small) or  face  the 
hour long wait till seven thirty and later still (four and a half 
hours  or even more,  as the "Marquee" almost never opens  up  on 
time).
In  the  end we decided on the latter and resolved  ourselves  to 
waiting.  But  not  without solid  and  liquid  refreshments.  We 
quickly  went  shopping and stocked ourself up with  burgers  and 
cider. 
After  standing  there,  waiting and doing nothing for  about  an 
hour,  we heard some distant rumbling. At first Sammy Joe thought 
it to be my stomach and offered readily to buy some more food. We 
soon  learned better as after another half hour the  rain  slowly 
but steadily started pouring down on our poor tormented souls. If 
we were pissed of by now,  it was to become even better.  An  icy 
cold  started  creeping up inside our clothes and  the  rain  had 
increased  to a real torrent.  We stood there for at least  three 
quarters of an hour, dripping like wet dogs (which basically with 
one  little  difference we felt like :  we were standing  on  two 
feet),  when  we suddenly realized that we could have it  better. 
Five seconds later we were sitting in a nearby pub. 
As the rain slowly ceased after about another hour we thought  it 
about  time to emerge from our nest and retake our places in  the 
queue.  Forty-five  minutes later we were inside.  Immediately  I 
acquired two ACID REIGN t-shirts and the matching base-ball cap. 
Support  was D.A.M..  They were perfect openers for  ACID  REIGN. 
When  after  half  an hour the  headliner's  appeared  there  was 
already a lot of headbanging and stagediving going on.  When ACID 
REIGN  finally  arrived on stage,  everyone  freaked  out.  Their 
music,  thrash with a little hardcore thown in,  carried everyone 
away, got lost and came back for more. It was absolutely amazing. 
The four musicians and the singer gave their rest and best.
I could go on for hours now,  but I won't....  a wait,  one  more 
incident  has  to  be told.  Right in the end they  asked  a  few 
people onto stage and performed a square dance.  Afterwards  came 
the  standard  ACID  REIGN exhibition :  Kev  the  guitar  player 
dropped his dungarees and kicked some ass (exhibited actually). 
At  about  11.30  p.m.  we got out exhausted but  happy  to  have 
witnessed such an exhilarating spectacle. As we tried to get into 
the  next tube station to go home,  we were confronted by  closed 
gates, police and the fire-brigade. A few minutes walk brought us 
to the next station,  but with the same results as before. When a 
third  try  didn't  offer any success,  we decided  to  take  the 
nightbus  instead.  As I had had a few pints to many  before  the 
concert,  it  was now my turn to be sick.  And the moral  of  the 
story ?  It never pays to be gloating, when your friend is having 
a bit of a problem. Help me Michael... wurghhh. 


Day Fifteen (Friday, 20th April '90):

While  taking  a walk with the dog,  I came by  a  news-stall.  I 
daringly decided to buy the "Sun". Partly because of page soandso 
but  also  as  a result of the headline,  which  was  printed  in 
larger-than-life  leters  :  "ARE LONDONERS BEING BOMBED  OUT  OF 
THEIR OWN TUBE ?".  That caught my interest. Apparently there had 
been a bomb threat the night before, which had turned out to have 
been a hoax. 
My mood was constantly turning darker and darker,  as the day  of 
my  departure was drawing nearer and nearer.  The next day  would 
only consist of the morning in Teddington,  the drive to  Gatwick 
Airport  and the flight back "home" to Geneva.  The  afternoon  I 
would spend in the familiar circle of my family. 
The afternoon Mike and me spent, doing this and that and going to 
the  "Anglers" once more.  Afterwards I listened to the "song"  I 
had "written" in five minutes and which we had "performed"  about 
four  timers.  Funny !  Each time round it  sounded  differently. 
Jesus  !   I  is  quite  embarrassing  when  you  hear   yourself 
"singing"? on cassette. At the time we actually did it, it seemed 
like a lot of fun though.

PART V :

At long last I have almost arrived at the end of what I see as an 
enormously( boring ?) long article.  It seems to have taken about 
two weeks to complete, which I think is quick work, when you take 
the  fact  that  I  am  in school five  days  of  the  week  into 
consideration.  I  know,  that  not many of you out  there  cared 
enough to read all of it,  which I personally understand. The few 
that  took the time I want to thank sincerely for taking my  work 
seriously.  You  alone are worth the hours of work put into  this 
article. Thanks ! 
The  real reason behind all this is to show Mike and  family  the 
great  time  I've  had while staying in  London.  Thanks  to  the 
Schusslers.  I  am particularly grateful to Michael's sister  for 
letting  me sleep in her room (she didn't know about it,  as  she 
was  absent in Germany).  I hope the Toblerone was music to  your 
tastebuds. Thanks also to Strongbow, for producing such excellent 
cider (which we had to buy though).  Thanks to my class mates for 
not  discouraging  me  and thanks to my patents  for  paying  the 
flight and for supplying me with nourishment while typing away on 
the keyboard.  This list could go on for quite a while, but let's 
go on to the next part.
