                                  by Michael Schuessler

Tufty  just send me his demo and as I have nothing better  to  do 
(except working for school which is no improvement!!)I decided to 
review it for all the people out there who have not heard of this 
demo. 

First of all a tune starts and then the menu appears.  At the top 
of  this  menu  there is a slow moving piece of  text  that  says 
Greetings.  This  sign just wraps and wraps and wraps and  wraps. 
Below  that there is a picture ( I suppose that that  is  TUFTY). 
Actually there is the same picture on the left and the right side 
of  the  screen.  Beneath the left picture it  says  :  1.  Roger 
Rabbit- Out of time and under the picture on the righhandside  it 
says   ASWI  demo.  At  the bottom of the screen  there  are  two 
scrollers (can you still call it a scroller ?  it is bloody  slow 
to read and therefore I gave up after the 1st three words). 

Anyway  if you press the 1-key the disk drive will start  loading 
and you will see a very very nice picture of Roger  Rabbit.  This 
picture as I have already said very good.  A quartet tune starts. 
By  pressing  the  space bar you can advance to  the  next  tune. 
All together there are 8 different tunes some of which are rather 
boring.  But I must say that there are some which are pretty good 
!! Something that I do not like about this here is that you can't 
exit  it,  you must reset your computer to get to the main  menu. 
Oh,  I just about forgot something, if you feel like listening to 
the musix via your speakers and you have the ST Replay  cartridge 
plugged in just hit the F2 key and listen to the results.

The ASWI demo is (at least for my taste) a lot better !  There is 
a  digitized  picture in the middle of the screen and  there  are 
some  notes  flashing here and there.  Not to forget there  is  a 
sample  playing at the same time.  Close to the bottom  there  is 
some kind of a scroller.  Anyway,  that scroller tells you  about 
the keys and button you can press !!!!  Basically you can  change 
the picture in the middle of the screen to a few different faces. 
There  is even a short animated sequence.  The the sample is  too 
fast or slow for you,  no problem,  simple bang on the right  key 
and  the speed will change.  I am not quite sure about this  here 
now  but  I think that you can also change the  sample.   I  just 
about forgot again that you cannot exit the screen.

By the way,  the source Code for the ASWI demo will be either  in 
this  issue  or in the next one (depending on the space  that  is 
left on the disk!!!).
 
As  there  is nothing else to say or review in this demo  I  will 
give you my summary.

------------------------------------
Overall                       : 7

I reckon that this demo is different to the others and the reason 
why I did not give it any better marks is that there are so  many 
demos  just like this one around.  Sorry Tufty (keep up the  good 
work anyway!!!).

                                   2.55 pm and I will have to  do 
                                   some Physics now. BORING !!!!
