            SOLUTION  - Part I -  of  Castle Master by MIK
       
 
Better make sure you mitt's well oiled and your fists are primed for a
slugfest(kill 26 ghosts).Because the fate of your team and your girl-
friends life(the princess) are on the line in two new games of 
Incencitive,called Castle Master I & Castle Master II(The Crypt).
THIS IS PART I OF THE SOLUTION TO CASTLE MASTER I:


Wilderness: 
-----------
              At the beginning of the game,you stand in front of 
              the castle.
              First step is that you have to shoot the stone well
              placed into the little hole next to the drawbride.
              Now the way in the castle is free. 
              After you have done it,go around the castle,until you've
              reached the wizard's hut.Notice:You can't swim.
              
Wizard's hut:
-------------
              In the hut ,there are a cheese(eat it),a table ,a green 
              carpet and a white chair with a red star on it.
              Climb on the chair,then on the table ,turn yourself
               to the chair         and what do you see
              at the top of the chair.... a key (number one).
              Select option 'crawl' and jump  into the hole after 
              removing the carpet.
              Now you are in one cavern of the catacombs.There is
              a ghost here.Kill him and take the Pentacle(You have
              to collect 10 pentacles in the game to get finally the 
              last key,the tenth).
              In the catacombs are many caverns withe one ghost each.
              But to that later.
The Castle  : Now you have to find the cellar steps,the entrance is 
------------  green.Go upstairs to the N/W-Tower.On the leftt side,
              there is a cheese(eat it).On the right side there are 
              two green buttons.Push them.After doing that,the yellow
              barrier will go up.Crawl to the door.This is the guard
              room.Use the West-Passage to South/West-Tower,crawl 
              about the steps to come forward.Eat the cheese and follow 
              the corridor.At the end of it you can see the      
              folding-door of the great hall.(Again a ghost to kill)
              Enter the passage to the left atrium.
Gate House   :Four ways......
------------- on the left side is the entry to the courtyard.It's really
              nice designed.

CourtYard    :    
-------------
              1.Hay barn
                      Collect key ,kill ghost
              2.Stables....
                There is a key and a cheese.
                A wooden horse - the 'Trojan Horse'
                The 2nd key is in the horse.So crawl under the horse,
                click with the right mouse button in the hole..a key(Nr.2)
              3.The well....(in german - der Brunnen -)
                Klick into it ....a key (Nr.3)
              4.Chapel...
                Walk to the cross.Then turn 45 degree right.You will see
                the entrance of the belltower.
                Enter this room and play bellringer!Whoooshh..a pentacle
                (2)lies on the floor.Take it,leave the bellroom and 
                eat the cheese near the altair.You will need the force,
                Luke(?!).
                Under the pulpit(in german -Kanzel-)you can find an 
                entrance to a cavern.Crawl into that hole,kill ghost
                take pentacle etc..
                Go upstairs(green door).You are in the North/West-Tower.
                Take a walk to the kitchen(S/E-Tower).
