Well, I read in the first issue of MAGGIE a very interesting 
letter (to FAST). I would like to thanx the LOST BOYS for having 
published it and I would like to give my point of view about this 
problem, too.

I must say that I mostly agree with I.AM.ANOMAUS, the guy who 
write the letter (no, that's not me again, under another name!).

I think that organisations such as FAST should try to do 
something more useful (i.e fighting the cracked games SELLERS, 
they are the real pirats!!!).
If they want to arrest every pirat on the earth, they should 
arrest EVERYBODY using a computer (themselves too, if they do 
even know what a computer is).

Yes, in fact, I'm fed up with the hypocrisy. Everybody should 
know that the magazine journalists, the editors and even the 
authors themselves are some of the best pirats sources. 
To tell you the truth, I know some journalists, I work for an 
editor, I am an author and, yes, I do pirat! I've nearly 20 
cracked games and some utilities. But, I totally agree with 
I.AM.ANOMAUS idea. When a game is really good (in fact, very few 
are but the quality tends to improve), we all ought to make an 
effort and save money to buy it.
I personnaly bought many games: GOLDRUNNER, DUNGEON MASTER, 
MIDWINTER, BARBARIAN 2, BLOODWYCH, COSMIC PIRATE (ha, ha!),
XENON 2, CHAOS STRIKES BACK, POLICE QUEST 2, DRAGON'S BREATH, 
SEVEN GATES OF JAMBALA, CHAMBERS OF SHAOLIN, THE KRISTAL and many 
more others (some were gifts for my birthday, too)... And I 
rarely was deceived. 
Hey, don't believe I'm rich. I am 18 and I am a student so I do 
not have much money...
But, yes, when a game is good, I think that the authors (and the 
editors) should be rewarded. A good game (I'm not talking about 
crapy SHOOT'EM UPs) actually needs hours and hours of hard work.
This is usually even harder than coding a demo. So, I think that 
authors of nice games deserve the money for it.
The problem is that the game aren't exactly cheap and many guys 
NEVER buy any game "coz it's too expensive!". I don't think 
that's vey honest. These guy are ready to pay for tapes, CD, 
disks, clothes, concert tickets and other stuff but, as it is 
easy to get some cracked version of games & utilities, they will 
never make any effort to buy some softs.
Yes, those freaks are probably destroying (or at least damaging) 
the software industry. If we all want the things to get better, 
we should all make some efforts, not only the software companies 
and the authors. Pirats should try to respect REAL GOOD WORK 
(waiting a few weeks before cracking a good soft, 'coz they can't 
help cracking, anyway...) and users should save money to ACTUALLY 
BUY the great stuff (my advises: wait for DRAGON FLIGHT (Hi, Erik 
& Udo!), EPIC (GOLDRUNNER 3D), 4D BOXING, LOOM...).

That's right, the best DEMO makers will make the best GAMES. 
Let's just help them so that they will be able to push the ST 
beyond its limits (yeah!!!). But a game isn't like a demo and 
some games programmers deserve our support to: The BITMAP BROS., 
the ASSEMBLY LINE, THE ARGONAUTS (Jez San, the great 3D guy), 
John Michael PHILLIPS, Pete COOK, Mike SINGLETON, Michael POWELL, 
BULLFROG and many others...

So, I ask all the real ST-freaks to think about it and, perhaps, 
to change their mind and to help all games designers to give us 
fun with real, efficient, powerful, big and brainblasting games 
for our loved machine.
And I hope there will be more and more guys like I.AM.ANOMOUS to 
help (yes, help!) the software industry and denounce the 
hypocrisy of our system. Thank you ANOMOUS! And thanx to TLB again 
for publishing this letter.
