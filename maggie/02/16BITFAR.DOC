                         by Michael Schuessler

What, two show reviews in one magazine ? Yes, it's been very busy 
here  in London.  I had to get up at 8 o' clock  on the  29th  of 
June  (it was the Saturday).  First of all I went to  Spaz's  and 
Manikin's  place owho swore at me for coming round so  early.  It 
took us about one hour to get to the show.  We have then  managed 
to get in free with the help of some of our great friends. 

The show was mainly attended by software companies trying to sell 
crap games.  The only companies which I found were worth visiting 
were Microedeal,  2 Bit Systems,  16/32 PD Library, PAGE 6 (great 
friends of ours,  glad you like the mag), Riverdene PDL, Frontier 
Software,   Hi  Soft,  GFA  Data  Media,  Psygnosis,  Soft  Stuff 
Software  and Softville.  The rest of the companies  were  trying 
to  sell  their  games cheaper than  their  opponent  around  the 
corner. 

Psygnosis were showing off their new game "Anarchy". This game is 
the defender type.  The scrolling is extremely fast.  You  should 
avoid the bullets in order to survive the first wave. 
The  second game that they were showing off is  Matrix  Marauders 
with some fast 3D arcade game concept. 

Soft  Stuff  Software  were  showing  around  their   educational 
software  with programs like :  Let's spell at the  shops,  Let's 
spell at home, things to do with numbers and many other products. 

Stampede  were trying to show off their disk magazine  which  has 
been voted the worst magazine on the Atari ST (sorry guys,  but I 
just do not like it!!!). 

Something  that  I did not like too much from the  show  is  that 
their were so many Amigas standing around,  but in a way that was 
quite  good as we got some more ideas for programs to convert  to 
the ST. There were millions of great demos at the show with demos 
featuring very fast 3D animation which is bloody good !!! 

GFA  Data Media brought some more useful products on  the  market 
like  GFA  Documentation,  GFA Gup,  GFA Draft plus  and  Mission 
Control / Gshell.  This last program is a shell for the use  with 
the interpretator and the compiler and the other products. 

There  have been some more educational software releases  for  us 
older  guys doing their GCSE's.  The programs are  Primary  Maths 
Course (for 3 to 12 years) and micro Maths for the GCSe's. 

That's  it for the soft and hardware.  As at the last  show  many 
computer groups came to visit.  These groups were Watchmen,  TLb, 
many guys from Inner Circle,  Andy, Derek, Wizpop (thanks for the 
great picture !!!) and New Order.   Many new demos were  released 
at the show, most of which are reviewed in the demo section. 

I am not going to go into much more detail now as I am rather  in 
a hurry to get the second Issue of Maggie out. So I hope that you 
found this article at least informative to some extend.

P.S.:  The  show  was  not  as good as the  Atari  show  but  was 
       definitely worth going to!!!
