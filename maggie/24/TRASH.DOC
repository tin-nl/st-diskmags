[Jody]  Oh Mr. Holland, how  pretty  your  windows.   This is nice you
know, but I think it could  be  improved  if  you introduced it all by
coming on at the beginning, singing:  "We're  trash, you and me, we're
the litter on the  breeze,  we're  the  lovers  on the streets".  That
would just make it something else, that would.

[Jody]  Well, there are several things  that  I  would have chosen for
the Trashcan, but didn't quite make  it in.  Things like umbrellas and
old people and old people holding  umbrellas and those blokes you find
in public toilets, wetting their hair.

        Pets Win Prizes would  have  been  a  class  decision too, but
thankfully that's no longer on  the  air.   Robbie  Williams was to be
another choice, after  doing  that  ironic,  Pete Townsend patronising
single, 'Old Before I Die'.  It's obvious the only reason he chose the
title was because Die rhymes with Pie.   And the bastard went out with
Anna Friel.

€        Oh, and Super Huey  was  to  be  another decision, but because
it's such an obscure pre-flight sim ST  game from years ago, you would
never have heard of it and therefore wouldn't know what the hell I was
going on about.

[Jody]  Well Chris, for my first  choice of trashcan incineration, I'm
opting for a pair who are stuck  firmly  up the arse of the daytime TV
undead.  It's that lovely  show-biz  couple,  Richard Madeley and Judy
Finigan.

        Now, Richard and Judy  are  crap,  that  much  is obvious, and
they're not really that  much  more  excessively  vile  than any other
daytime or morning television presenter - including that pair of half-
wits that present  Light  Lunch  on  Channel  4,  flexing  their comic
muscles by passing weak jokes about  like  hot potatos.  But the thing
that annoys me so much  about  Richard  and  Judy  is that they're not
simply serial show presenters - they're bloody celebrities too.

        Most channels lock their morning presenters up after sun down,
but ITV flaunt them like sassy hookers, encouraging them to have their
own shows when all  outside  is  dark,  such  as  The Richard and Judy
Tonight Show.  Even the  name  makes  you  cringe  like a baby sucking
lemons and when they  drag  on  murdering  Mr  Guilty himself, OJ (and
Lemonade) Simpson, to talk about his love of gardening, butchering and
driving really fast away from  millions  of  police officers, you just
have to wonder what the hell's going on.

€        It's not  just  the  fact  that  Richard  and  Judy  are shite
presenters, but it's also because  they're  profoundly ugly.  Anne and
Nick were hardly an attractive pair,  but  if  you were to see Richard
and Judy walking down the street you'd  throw fruit at them they're so
disfigured.

        And then there's Anne and Nick.   People mocked Anne and Nick.
Nick with his witty football pundits  and  Anne with her lovable girl-
next-door charm and megalomaniacal  hunger  for  higher pay, but at
least they had character.  And they  never brought they're bloody kids
in to whinge and  smash  the  place  up  while  that  sad guy with the
jumpers danced around on a map of Great Britain, never even having the
decency to fall in once.

        Richard Madeley is  also  well  famed  for  being a piss-tank,
having loaded a Tesco's trolley  up  with  two hundred pounds worth of
alcohol and then craftily  attempting  to  sneak  it  past the counter
without paying, a couple of years  back.   Neither of them really care
for the food that's prepared on  This Morning either, though plenty on
wine is always  spread  about  the  fake  kitchen  table  to help lure
Richard over to the fodder  and  where  Richard  goes, Judy is sure to
follow, often donning dark  glasses  to  cover  her dodgy contact lens
scuffed eye.

        You  could  always  hark   at   the  laddish  beverage-related
behaviour of Richard, though truthfully 'wineing  it' is all an act of
escapism from his sad and worthless  life.   We can only hope that one
day he will turn to  something  a  little  more harsh, such as Heroin,
though he'd probably  get  credit  for  it  to  later  appear  in some
Trainspotting sequel, drugging it up,  dodging  the filth and shagging
under age floozies.

        Richard and Judy, what  more  can  I  say?  For Christ's sake,
Chris, put 'em in.

[Jody]  I doubt the significance of this one almost as much as I doubt
the chances of it getting in, but  my  second choice for the Trash can
is computer related in the shape of Maggie disk labels.

        There is, of course, no doubting  the quality of Maggie itself
- I write for it for Christ's sake - but when it comes to sticky paper
presentation, the whole package is dragged down a key.

        Look at ST+.  Monthly it may  be and sometimes tatty round the
edges, but at least the labels look ripe, tasty and oh-so colourful to
boot (clever wording, I know,  thanks).   Other diskmags have followed
suit, but Maggie, the prissy queen  of  the diskmag scene is left half
naked, with only a scrap of a torn up label to restore any dignity.

        I have even had issues sent to me that went totally label-less
altogether, with just the previous sticker - tending to read something
like 'Language Disk' -  torn  up  a  bit,  allowing  'Maggie 23' to be
scrawled in one corner.

        Such an effort is made over the intro presentation and article
select screen that the disk label proves  an insult to the rest of the
magazine.  Do something about it, man.

++++++++++

[Jody]  First off I would like  to  emphasize the  fact that, though I
have a wide spread of friends from  near  and far, I am and never have
been a member of a club.   Oh,  apart  from some ghost busting club I
set up when I was about eight, though that was just a ploy to convince
club members that the weird boy  at  school was possessed by demons so
that they could go and kick the hell out of him.

        Saying this, I have  nothing  at  all  against clubs, and even
trainspotters have a higher intellect than those vile ManchesterUnited
fanatics who live nowhere near and  have  never been to Manchester in
their lives, but decide to support them anyway, simply because they're
doing better than their own  local  teams.   But there is one definite
group that really do deserve  to  have  the  dogs  set  on them.  I am
talking about the  lifeless  morsels  that  live  under  the  title of
'Rambler'.
€
        Living most of my life in rural  Suffolk, I enjoy the odd walk
along  a footpath, or a  tramp  through  some woodlands with a girlie,
but turning an occasional past-time into  a constant obsession is just
sick.  Ramblers won't just go for a half-hour trek in the countryside,
they'll gather together in vast groups, all backpacked-up with thermos
flasks and packed  lunches,  wearing knitted Benny-what-used-to-be-in-
Crossroads hats and wellies.

        Ramblers are also the only  people  in  the world - other than
Frence exchange students - who wear their rucksacks on BOTH shoulders,
unknowing how totally  uncool  it  looks.   But  these sad, misguided
souls - who were probably  abused  as  children  - look no better when
dressed down for home-wear, in  their sensible jumpers and shoes-like-
moccasins, 'because they're comfortable'.

        To prove my point  furthermore,  if  I  need  to, there was an
extreme  case  of  typical  Rambling  stupidity  a  few  months  back,
appearing on the local news:  A  family  had  bought a plot of land in
Norfolk and had a house built  on  it,  not  knowing that an amount of
this land was originally chartered for  Rambling.  It wasn't until the
house was  fully  built  and  furbished  that  the  Official  Rambling
Association (natch) started to complain that they could no longer drag
their filthy pilgrims along the same route  as they always had, due to
the new addition of twenty tons of bricks and mortar.

        The Ramblers were first  advised  to  take  a different route,
such as the adjacent  footpath  but  twenty  metres  away, which later
joins the now obstructed rambling  route.   "It's  just not the same,"
said one, inbred, National  Health specs-wearing, forty-something crow
- probably a post woman.  "It's an  offical rambling path and we shall
take it to the highest court to get it back."

        Which they did.  And won.  Using Official Rambling Association
Core Directive 413, I  suspect,  resulting  in the house-owning family
losing all trespassing  and  land  ownership  rights,  meaning  that a
filthy group of ten or so muddy  geeks could stomp through their front
€door, across the family's hall, living room and kitchen, to eventually
reach the  back  door  to  continue  their  sad,  pitiful  and  rather
pointless past-time into the night,  whenever  the Ramblers so desired
it, ruining the  poor  family's  domestic  set-up  and diminishing any
chances to put the house up for sale in the future.  Fact.

        Ramblers are the type of  people  you  simply want to shoot in
the legs, spawned from the type of  kids you used to force feed stones
in school lunchbreaks, for  preferring to  do  bark rubbings than play
with war toys.  Put them in the Trashcan.  Then gas them.

[Jody]  My next choice is a character  close to everyone's arse:  It's
PC superbabe, Lara Croft.

        It's cruel in a way to  throw a fictional creation of computer
game stardom into the Trashcan, even  if  it's as totally obnoxious as
Bubsy, Kid Chameleon, or that  pink  thing  that Psygnosis desperately
tried to market with some  shite  supporting single, but failed.  Said
titles can hardly be battered  any  more  than they have already been,
after falling into the vast  pit  of commercial failure, shortly after
release, but the marketing ploy  that  is  Lara  Croft is simply quite
ridiculous.

        There  is  nothing  really   astonishing  about  Tomb  Raider.
Basically it's Doom, viewed from behind, with a few swimmy bits in it,
but the soul reason why the game has received so much publicity is not
because Tomb Raider is anything  outlandishly special, but because the
main character is a 3D lady,  holding  guns,  not wearing much, with a
good arse and big boobs.  That look all square, damnit.

        Lara Croft started life on  the  cover  of many a PC magazine,
before moving onto the fronts of console literature, which, surely, is
where she should stay.  But nooooo.

        Let Ms. Croft feature on the  odd  poster if people are really
willing to buy it, but on the  cover  of The Face magazine?  Planet 24
even saw fit to show clips of  Tomb  Raider 2's intro sequences on The
Paul Ross Show the  other  month.   Egads,  next  she'll  be in Hello,
€talking about her favourite room.

        Many times Lara Croft has  been  described as 'any boys dream'
and though an animated chunk of textured  polygons was far from what I
lusted over as a feisty pre-teen, I  suppose being able to turn a girl
on at the press of a button does have its advantages.

[Jody]  I like hygiene.  Hygiene is gooood.  I also like being able to
eat soup without getting chunks of it  stuck  to my face.  This is why
my next choice for worldly exclusion  is  that cultivated crop of face
fuzz, the beard.

        Beards are  fine  if  you're  a  seventies  rock  icon,  or  a
fishmonger, or Brian Blessed,  but  if  you  are  anyone  else and can
really afford a razor, then beards are a ridiculous facial addition of
quite un-fashionable proportions.

        I am  one  of  these  unfortunate  types  who  is  generous of
hormones, so as soon as I've  shaved  in the morning, those old facial
follicles are getting ready to stubble  out  straight away again, so I
understand that you can get through  razor  blades like a fat man gets
through pies, but still, shelling  out  for  sharpies  is a damn sight
better than looking like The Wild  Man  of  Borneo every single day of
your life.

        Having a beard through blatant laziness is one thing, but when
- like most beard owners  -  you  buy  an  electric beard trimmer, you
surely are having a laugh.   Do  beard  wearers  really  get up in the
mornings and think 'Shall I shave today, or should I opt for the hedge
look?'
€
        I understand that many  a  man  so  generous  of face hair was
forced into it in order to  hide  some  of that teenage acne, but even
Mr. Crater Face gets an opportunity with  the odd girl or two.  Beardy
weirdy's only manage to  pull  old  folk.   Often  men.  Or women with
beards.

        I know that certain  members  of  the  Atari community will be
itching their chins with anger at this point (making a lovely hacksaw-
against-wood sound in the  process),  but  frankly  I don't care.  You
look ridiculous and your poor partners  must go through hell everytime
you set out for a  tongueing, so  for Christ's  sake shave it off.  Or
perhaps you like having mouth muff?

++++++++++

[Jody]  Final choice already?  Alright then.   I  thought that I would
finish on  something  monumental,  defacing  the  folklore  of ancient
situation comedy by choosing  the  show  that  has  kept  alive on our
€screens many years after all it's  cast have died, been buried, rotted
to nothing and then promptly forgotten about.  I'm talking about Dad's
Army.

        Dad's Army is a disgrace.   I  fail  to  find how the show was
ever anything near amusing back in  the  seventies, so it sure as hell
isn't the slightest bit funny  now.   A  load  of  old men, near death
infact, walking about in uniform, insulting each other and patronising
everyone else is a TV  experience  near  to walking into the VodaPhone
Centre and why it is still regularly inflicted upon modern day viewers
I simply do not know.

        Just look at what Dad's  Army  has  lead  to:  I truly believe
that war in the Gulf was caused by Dad's Army.  Those crazy Iraqi guys
saw the bloody travesty on  import  and  thought "Eh up, those British
troops are a bit knackered aren't they?  Invading close continents and
pinching their oil will be a doddle  if  all we're gonna get is a load
of OAP's shaking their sticks at us."

        And what about the  plot  content?   Soldiers  are in a field,
stupid young soldier discovers  landmine,  stupid  young soldier tells
skinny, wrinkly one with white  hair  and comedy spectacles, who flaps
about saying 'Mister Mainwaring' alot to that bloke who did the voice
overs on The Mister Men, before the guy in the white tin hat turns up,
tells  everyone  they're  idiots  and  shouldn't  be  allowed  out  in
daylight, before shoo-ing a bird from  the hedge-row that lands on the
landmine in a  million-to-one  situation,  cue-ing stumbling soldiers,
canned laughter and comedy burst of feathers before it all.

        And let's not forget that Dad's  Army killed The Simpsons.  It
was after much hype and speculation  that  The Simpsons made it to the
BBC, before they were axed after  a  five  week run, to be replaced by
said decrepit sitcom.  Whoever  made  such  a decision quite obviously
didn't have a head, let alone  a  sense  of humour.  Even Hi-De-Hi was
better than this.  Well, perhaps not.

        If the BBC didn't  order  enough  pap-filled  re-runs of Dad's
€Army, they order another season of it whenever yet another cast member
dies of a stroke and  even  though  a  majority have already 'done the
dying fly', stuff  like  series  anniversaries  and  those horrid head
candy fodder shows packed with space  filling clips of classic/old and
forgotten (delete where applicable) sitcoms only bring Dad's Army back
to haunt us like a big scarey ghost.

        You get Virtual Reality and Virtual Pets and even Virtually No
Chloresterol, but Dad's Army is Virtual Comedy:  It looks like comedy,
it sounds like comedy, by  jove  it  even  smells like comedy, but the
truth is that Dad's Army is not comedy.  It's shite.
