     Welcome to the Gateway to  Literature  that isn't Poetry Corner..
in fact the only iambic  pentameters  you'll  find here are, we assure
you, wholly unintentional because Shakespeare has  beaten us to it (by
some 400 years) so  it  is  our  philosophy  to  go beyond the earthly
confines of poetic forms and  create  a new genre, something exciting,
innovative, catering for two types  of  poetry readers, both those who
have  heard of 'The Daffodils' and those  who have read it as well (or
at least the first line).

     Our New Poetic Form not only serves  up tasty morsels for both of
the  aforementioned  groups  but  also   supplies  the  needs  of  the
'poetically can't-be-arsed', those who, put simply, cannot be arsed to
read poetry.  These people will  be  pleased  that our new poetic form
enables them to LOOK at the following  poems, not reading one word and
yet comprehend, if not the full meaning,  then at least its most basic
level.  What a wonder it is..

     This month in Maggie we have all  been soaking up the lurve vibes
emanated from a certain pair (how's  Jane Felice?!), and in tribute to
cupid's aim, we are including a  selection of luuurve poems to snuggle
up to..

     Beware those monitors don't get too steamy..

                       [Mr Pink to his Falcon]




           Shall I compare thee to John Summerfield's pay?
                    Thou hast a figure as lovely,
                      Proportions as bountiful..


            [William Shakespeare, sonnet 18, early draft]




                       You Have Eyes Like Gem..

            Your hair is as silky as a hardware scroller,
            Your hands as dextrous as a mouse accelerator
             Your curves have been smoothed in God Paint
       And compared to your perfection, 'Spirits' are no saints.

        Your ivory complexion is a flawless high-res desktop,
        You're more heavenly than an Atari-only computer shop
          (Well considering they're all extinct now anyway)
                (you can't have it all your own way).

          But your voice is as harmonious as a disk loading
                Or seven shapes in Skyfall, exploding.
               Your touch is as electric as my monitor
                  And oh! I just want so much more..

            [Atari fanatic getting his priorities right.]
