It was just another  day  on  the  'net  -  the  normal usual mindless
cruising of sites, http here  ftp  there. Nothing particularly amazing
to report back or make the  software tastebuds tingle with excitement.
And then I read my email. It was a simple harmless message from a long
lost friend, all it recommend was that I check out this obscure French
web site and download a copy  of  the  program  on offer there. It was
going to change my life. Apparently. I filed the email away and didn't
touch it again.

Several weeks later while backing  up  my  mail  folders I came across
that same message, work was slow,  time  was  on hand so I slammed the
URL into the browser and waited. A  few moments later there it was. An
Atari ST emulator for the PC  running under the title PaCifiST. Hmmm..
I'd seen attempts  at  ST  emulators  before  and  quite  frankly they
weren't worth the disk space  they  occupied. However the screen shots
made this one look suitably  different  and the compatability seemed a
lot higher. I downloaded the relatively  small file, stuffed it into a
folder somewhere and went back to my work.

A couple of weeks after this while  cleaning  out my hard drive I came
across the file again, wanting to  give  it  at least it's fair chance
before I sent it to recycle bin heaven  I unzipped it and took a peek.
Thankfully I'd bothered to get hold of a TOS ROM image for it and some
little thing called AssiST which was  supposedly  going to make it all
so much easier. I installed  the  lot,  ran  AssiST, played with a few
vague settings and let it rip.

Good God.. that's GEM! Albeit  a  very  early TOS 1.00 implementation,
but it was my beloved  GEM  none-the-less.  I  moved the mouse around,
grabbed windows, hit the drop  downs,  created folders and wallowed in
long lost love until it occured to me that I might like to try running
Äsomething. I had a copy of TEX's LCD  demo as part of the download and
double-clicked it, not expecting much. Thankfully  I was so wrong! LCD
sprang to life on-screen, music, scroll texts, colour cycling and all.
I nearly fainted.

That was all the proof I needed, from  that  point on I went on a mild
download frenzy bagging all  the  files  I  could.  In those tentative
first few hours I saw old  Pompey  menus, classic ST demos, little GEM
applications, TCB Tracker,  STOS  Basic  and  a  handful  of  apps all
running on my PC. This was truly emulation heaven.

PaCifiST
========

At the time of writing the  current  release  is 0.47b and things just
keep on getting better. Since my first few days with it, I've grown to
love PaCifiST and really appreciate  what  it  can  do. I've wasted so
many hours playing old games  such  as  Buggy  Boy and Xenon, watching
classics like the Union demo  and  Flashback  scroll across my screen,
listen to wonderful ST  chip  music  and  even some hissy soundtracker
offerings. It has been an  absolute  nostalgia  joyride right from the
start and my only regret was leaving  it alone for a month before even
trying it.

So.. who exactly needs PaCifiST? Well for a start it's ideal for those
who, like me sold up their Atari gear and moved into the PC world many
moons ago but still ache for  the  "scene" and all that that entailed.
If you've got a PC good  enough  to  run  the emulator (a P120 is more
than fast enough for most requirements) then you are set.

But even if you still own  an  ST it's worth installing PaCifiST. Why?
well for a start you can assign up  to 14 meg's worth of memory to the
emulator, swap between TOS roms  with  the  slap  of a key, include PC
hard drives as Atari drives thus allowing gigabytes worth of cheap and
fast hard drive space!  You  can  boot  between  low,  medium and mono
resolutions without unplugging  cables  or  switching  monitors. It is
infact the almost perfect development system!
Ä
However I'm not claiming  it's  100%  perfect,  there  are indeed many
things still to be fixed  and  GEM applications will function *almost*
perfectly. Speed wise you  can  toggle  between  Max  speed and normal
speed. Max speed is ideal for  working  with GEM is it can effectively
increase the speed of a  normal  ST  by  up  to  350% (if running on a
Pentium Pro 200 like I do) so if you are therefore compiling a program
for example, it'll compile  a  darn  sight  faster! Window movement is
also a lot cleaner.

Programs available for download such  as  ImageBuild will allow you to
image your real ST disks for use  with  PaCifiST. One thing to note is
that it doesn't use the Pc's  actual  floppy drive (unless you tell it
to, but it's not recommended) instead  it  works on images of the real
disks. For example you  can  take  a  real  ST  disk,  image it into a
PaCifiST file (.ST) and then load  that  into the emulator. The result
is a disk image which boots considerably faster, can be written to and
even formatted! It can  also  load  MSA  files (Magic Shadow Archives)
which was the most popular  format  used  to  image real ST disks into
single compressed files. Utilities exist to  convert MSA to ST images,
or you can just load the  MSA  direct  into PaCifiST (except you can't
write to it).

As I write this the PaCifiST emulation scene is seriously undergoing a
large change. Lots of old "scene"  people  are slowly starting to move
back to the ST, albeit  in  a  emulated  form  on their PC's. Old demo
crews are re-appearing and even releasing  new titles and screens! Old
cracking crews are coming back and  are  free  to talk about the "good
old days" without fear  of  incrimination  or  law suits. I personally
know several people who have gone  out  and purchased REAL ST's simply
because of PaCifiST and the nostalgia it welled up inside of them.

Available  on  the  Internet  are  thousands  of  programs  ready  for
download, including  selections  such  as  the  entire  Pompey Pirates
archive - if you want to play  an  old classic game that you'd be hard
pushed to find stocked in any shop  anywhere  or even sold as 2nd hand
software - worry no more, most of it is downloadable from the 'net for
Äfree. That is the way it should  be - although it is still technically
pirated software the software houses !  are no longer making any money
from the sale of it and  indeed  probably  havn't  been for the past 5
years or so. So to have the  images available for FREE download is the
right step in the ST emulation scene.

If you'd like to learn more  about  PaCifiST  make your first stop the
official web site at http://pacifist.fatal-design.com  - and then move
onto The Little Green  Desktop at http://www.fatal-design.com/desktop/
where you will find a dedicated bulletin  board, Game Of The Week, all
the latest versions of  PaCifiST  and  associated  utilities, a screen
shots Gallery, hundreds of games  for  download,  live Java Chat and a
plenty more.

Those new to PaCifiST who have email access can request a newbies help
file by sending an  email  to  pacifist-help@fatal-design.com. It will
email the file directly back to you.

If you'd like  to  join  in  an  active  mailing  list  about PaCifiST
development  and  experiments,  send   a   message  to  pacifist-list-
request@fatal-design.com with the word SUBSCRIBE  in the subject field
and leave the body empty. You'll find most the old lot hang out on the
list as well as PaCifiST's developer.

Finally if you don't have  Internet  access  but  want to get PaCifiST
running on your PC anyway -  you  can  send  a blank high density disk
with *two* first class stamps  to  the  following address: Rich Davey,
PaCifiST Request, 162 Wells  Road,  Bristol,  BS4  2AX, England. Disks
will be returned within  a  week  (unless  you  forget  to enclose the
stamps in which case you won't ever see the disk again)

Oh and yes.. Maggie works perfectly under  PaCifiST - how do you think
I managed to read the last 5 issues? :)

Contact me if you've got  questions.  Visit  my  web  site if you want
