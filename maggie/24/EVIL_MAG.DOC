MaggieInterview with EVIL of DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY !! :-)


(Please note, Anders, you can answer the questions with as much or
as little detail as you want, but try to answer with more than
just one or two words, please. )


````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Can you give us a few details about yourself, where you were born,
attended schools, career etc:-
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Hello Felice, I'll do my best to answer your questions as
truthfully (haha) as I can. :-)

I've lived all my 24 years in a small town called "Sater" in
the middle of Sweden.

School however have never been something I have liked, so 
after the 9 first years (which ended up with quite lousy
grades) I choosed an easy Highschool education.

After school I have worked as almost anyting you can think
of. The job situation in Sweden -sucks- at the moment and
all jobs I've had so far have been either temporay or quite
low paid. So I don't have any career to brag about either,
sad case, ehh?

The future is looking somewhat brighter though. :-) 


````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
How did you start off in the world of hobbyist computing ?
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Hmm, tricky question. But I guess it was back in the days
of Speccy vs C64 wars. And I decided to get an MSX instead. :)
€Main reason of getting the first compy was ofcourse the games.

And to be perfectly honest, I still enjoy the old MSX games better
than todays Jaguar or Falcon ones.


```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
What prompted you to set up the Dead Hackers Society ?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Once upon a time (approx 6 years ago now) me and a few
friends decided to get a place where we could all put our
computers into one place, rather than each one of us were
working at separate places with our projects.

So one day we did get our own place (in a cement-room
down in a cellar), and we naturally called it "The Bunker".
After a while down in that cement-box we started to talk about
joining a few democrews together which already in practise was
one team. So we did, and called it the "Dead Hackers Society".


```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
What Atari systems do you own ? Please describe your setup.
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Current atari collection:

Atari 520 STfm
--------------
512 kbytes ram
2 floppy drives

Atari 520 STe 
--------------
4 megabytes ram
100 megs scsi harddisk

Atari Falcon030
€---------------
4 megabytes ram
120 megs ide harddisk.

Atari Falcon030
---------------
14 megabytes ram
120 megs ide harddisk
1gigabyte scsi harddisk
Jam DSP clock

And my real pride, the Atari cc192. :)

Planning to get:
Atari STe, 4megs with megafile 60.
Atari TT, 4/4 megs.
Atari 130XE with floppy drive (have you seen the demos
on this machine? totally insane!)


`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Which are your favourite demos on the ST, STE and Falcon ?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I like alot of them, many for different reasons, so I could
never tell just "that" demo is my favourite.. But among
the ones I really adore are:

Brain Damage (STe), Steps (ST, probably my favourite music-
demo ever), Synergy Megademo (ST), Obnoxious (Falcon), 
Autowashen.. (Falcon).

Alot of people will probably yell something like "noo what about
Sono, Eko System.. blabla". Well these ones might be better,
but the first feeling I get from a demo is usually what I
will always think of it. And when I first saw BD, Steps and the
others I was really really happy about them.

€
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
What are your favourite games of all time, on any system ?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I liked so many games back in the mid 80's, and dislike so
many games today so my favourites still are Galaga (MSX),
Knightmare (MSX), Wings of Death (ST) and a few others.
Note that I am no fan of strategy games that takes weeks
to play. I just can't justify the time it takes to play these,
but sure, I guess they are really good as well.


`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
What prompted you to start in comms and why do you call a BBS ?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I bought my first modem not so long ago ('90 I beleive) and back then
the main reason was to download the new demos from BBS (like Lynx BBS,
Red Dwarf, Eagles Nest among others). But quite soon the main goal
of calling them was to discuss matters with the other users in
the mail areas. These were the really golden years of my bbs calling.

Unfortunately, since I started to use internet my interest for the 
bbs'sgot weaker and weaker. And now, I never call them anymore. 
Call it betrayal, lameness, boring or whatever you like, but it's just
how things went out.  


``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Your thoughts are welcomed on the following subjects:-
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The Internet

Is good, becuase it gives me job. ;)

Honestly, everyone who has sometime been on irc #atari
should have seen me there now and then, and with all time
€I spend online I can't say other than I really like it.
It's just a big shame that the only useable browser for
GEM got commercial.


Movie censorship

Is crap in all manners.


Software piracy

I can't say I never copied anything illegally, 
but the programs I consider worth buying I do buy.
It's a tricky business, but what I really hate is people
saying "Hey Atari is dead, now it's free to copy anything".
Ask the few developers left what they think about that..


Past Atari Messe shows that you have attended (if any)

I've only been to Nordic Atari Shows so far, and I have
only been going there because of the hacking event, not
the exhibition. 


Coding conventions (Siliconvention etc)

I love these, it's definitely one of the best things 
I know. To meet all those #atari guys and then see
the new demos on bigscreen is really something.


UnderCover Diskzine

It's really ok. But I have to criticise their shell.
It doesn't run at all on my VGA screen, not on my SM124,
€only RGB. And the last issue didn't even work on my ST.

Less hardwaretricks for the shell and an ascii or html
edition would be good.


The Prodigy

Not my kind of music. 


The government

Hehe, I have never, and never will trust any politican.
And being totally uninterested in politics, I don't have
much to say really.


Rutger Hauer (actor, Blade Runner etc)

Ohh, my absolute favourite actor. :-)
Have a look at "The Hitchhiker", "Blind Fury" and you'll
see what I mean. 


```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Who are your favourite actors and actresses in TV or the movies ?
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Except Herr.Hauer above, I belive Brent Spiner (Data/TNG), 
Samuel Jackson and Celeste (hehehe) deserves a note for their
special talents. 


``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Which music groups do you like ? (Spice Girls don't count as a group.)
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
I like alot of the "heavy metal" musics from the 80's I grew up with,
€as JP, IM, Dio etc. But as most swedes I really enjoy the "GOA/Trance"
style of music that has grown alot the last years.

What I CAN'T stand however is all kind of RAP, R&B, and Ambient that 
MTV is full of today. I really doesn't like Jazz either (esp not with
trumpets).
