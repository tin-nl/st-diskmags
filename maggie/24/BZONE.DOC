                            BATTLEZONE:
                     A game for ST and Falcon by:
                          Andrew & Ian Gower

     We all remember  Lemmings  (and  so  did  the  programmer of this
game;) but BattleZone owes more to another  game of a similar name in
which you control a tank and attempt to  destroy your opponent (also a
tank) by firing shells across  the  screen  and judging both the angle
and amount of power needed to  achieve  a direct hit.  Battlezone, '96
style, requires these same skills but in  a form similar to  the Amiga
game Worms...  so with all  these  precedents  you  should have a good
idea of just which genre to file this game under (and please don't say
'miscellaneous unlabelled disk pile' or I'll start to s c
                                                         r
                                                      .  e  .
                                               .    .    a
                                                      \  m .    .
                                                     .   )   /
                                                        \!/
     Okay, you control a team of  4  worms  and must battle against an
opponent's team in a  landscape  of  your  choice.   The object of the
game, brutally put, is to massacre  all your opponents' worms using an
arsenal of assorted weaponry ranging from plasma rays, to grenades, to
kamikaze  suicide  runs,  before  they  massacre  you.   And  *bloody*
addictive it is too (sigh.. - a wearied Ed).
   
  On loading the game, from ST Low or Medium, we are greeted with a
badly drawn intro picture, reminiscent  of  a spectrum loading screen,
but worse (despite the  lack  of  colour  clash).   It  depicts a huge
flesh-coloured growth (which we  will  tastefully  avoid  using as the
subject for a succession of 'double-entendres' and instead assume that
Äthe artist DID model it on a garden earthworm and not something closer
to home;), wearing  a  bandana  and  brandishing  a  bazooka launching
barrel.  It's all enough to give dithering a bad name, so hit space as
fast as possible and  end  the  visual  torment  before you notice the
cardboard cut-out  pine-tree,  jagged  *awe-inspiring*  explosion  and
horrible STOS font informing you that:  'Program, Music and SFX are by
Andrew Gower and Graphics are  by  Ian  and Andrew Gower'.  "A-ha!" we
think... "yet another fabled  brother/brother  partnership, could this
be Code Master's 2,  or  even  an  all-male  version  of the Reservoir
Gods?" - our anticipation increases.

     Presentation for this game  is  functional:  white on black fonts
prevail (no nice  little  demo  effects  slipping  [or  should that be
Running?;] between  menus)  but  it  does  the  job  and  no-one could
complain that the menus are confusing or over-complicated which is all
good.

     Firstly you are given the choice  of: 'Single Game, Tournament or
Edit Teams'.  Editing teams  allows you  to change  team names and the
names of individual worms, for instance  I  created a 'Res Gods' team,
with worms: Mr Pink, Ripley, Sparehead (sadly numbers are not included
in the keyboard-handler) and MSG.   But  the  list of teams already in
the game is extensive: you  can  be  anything  from Star Trek to Close
Shave or, if the fancy takes you,  plain old biological worms - really
something for everyone (although I do  advise  creating a PC DADS team
and then blasting the  hell  out  of  'Bill  Gates, Intel, Windows and
Microsoft' ;).

     'Tournament' allows you to hold.. well.. tournaments, of up to 10
different player, some or none  of which could be computer-controlled.
Any computer-controlled teams which  you  create  must   be assigned a
difficulty rating from Easy, to Very Hard, but more on that later.

     In a single player game you  assign  yourself and  the computer a
team of worms.  You also  choose  the  difficulty of the computer team
and then the landscape in which you  do battle.  There are 8 different
landscapes: 'Castle, City, Space,  Hell,  Food,  Baby, War and Atari'.
ÄThere is also a Random landscape generator.

     The graphical quality of these landscapes varies from mediocre to
hideous.  Levels like Castle and Space have a primitive charm, whereas
Baby is simply so awfully dreadful that  it looks like it was drawn by
a 2 year old suffering from a bad case of nappy-rash - why its creator
has then prominently credited  himself  ['This  level  was designed by
Dave'] is a little bemusing.. maybe Ian  &  Andy put that in to ensure
complete disassociation from the  level  and  prevent it from tainting
the good name of  Gower...  or  maybe  Dave  is actually their younger
brother, albeit MUCH younger.  Anyway, it's  one  to avoid.  As is the
Atari  landscape  -  nice  idea  lads,  shame  about  the  quality  of
execution, I mean that pencil - and the fujis... nooooooo!

     Right, once you have  selected  the  zone,  you're into the game.
Both teams of worms will  have  been randomly scattered throughout the
landscape, some of them in  very  useful  positions  such as on top of
buildings, others in the  most  arseingly  unfair  places meaning that
there is no possible way  they  will  survive  long  enough for you to
teleport them away.  All worms are affected by explosions to lesser or
greater degrees - obviously a direct  hit  on  a worm will do the most
damage - but worms close to  an  exploding  bomb will take some damage
and worms that are on minuscule  islands  of  land may well be knocked
off by reverberations from bombs  exploding  on  the other side of the
level.  They will then  fall  off  the  bottom/side  of the screen and
become an 'ex-worm'.   In  fact  the  quickest  way  of despatching an
opponent's  worm is not  to  give  it  a  point-blank  blast from your
bazooka but to blow up the land  under  its feet and hope it falls out
of play and into history...

     Turns are taken  so  that  alternate  worms  from  each  team are
active.  The active worm is able  to  walk  or jump (with spacebar) as
much as it wants but can only fire  one weapon in its turn (apart from
the machine gun which gives  2  shots  per  go).    All the worms have
their names in their team  colours,  and their health values displayed
above them.  A direct hit on  a  worm  may  take  25 or even 50 health
points off it depending on the  difficulty  level and the weapon used.
ÄLess accurate aiming may only knock off a couple of points.

     The available weapons are: bazookas, rockets - which home in on a
set target,  grenades,  cluster  bombs,  dynamite,  air-strikes,  fire
punches (for close encounters worm to worm), machine guns, plasma guns
and kamikaze runs.  You also  have  options  to teleport, dig tunnels,
place girders to bridge gaps and also  skip  your go.  Your team has a
limited amount of  ammo  for  each  weapon/action,  thus, air strikes,
which cause a plane to fly over and  drop a series of fiery balls onto
a target worm of your choice, are not  only limited to 1 per team, but
are also only available after  a  few  turns into the game.  Likewise,
all weapons vary in power  and  effectiveness,  for instance you start
with 20 bazooka shells per team but  only 3 rockets because they don't
need as much skill to aim them.

     The extensive weaponry enables you to  find the best weapon for a
certain situation: sometimes  a  grenade  might  be  almost completely
useless to one  worm,  but  the  perfect  weapon  to another.  Certain
weapons are for close-encounters only - it is no use trying to use the
plasma-gun on an opponent worm at  the  other end of the level because
it has limited range, as has the machine-gun.

     For the long-range weapons you  have  a power-bar, the longer you
hold the mouse button down, the  further  the bomb will travel.  It is
the skill needed to judge the  power  and angle of trajectory required
to hit a worm at the  other  side  of  the level that makes Battlezone
such an addictive game.   With  practise  you  become  more skilled in
mastering your weaponry and therefore  able  to defeat the computer on
'Very Easy' (wow - Ed) and progress to the heady heights of.. 'Easy'!

     It would seem logical that  the  computer's difficulty level is a
measure of its accuracy in aiming the weaponry and to some degree this
is true, but the game is  coded  so  that  computer worms, set to Very
Hard, and even Hard or Medium, don't take as much damage from a direct
hit as you do.  In one instance I  was taking off the grand total of 5
health points for a direct hit on  a Very Hard worm, whereas they were
still taking off 25 to 50  from  me.   This discrepancy seems a little
Äunreasonable, especially as they have  near-perfect aim and you, being
human, are always at risk  from  malicious  flies aiming themselves at
your eye-ball just  at  the  crucial  moment  of  release,  or the dog
deciding that your  feet  look  a  little  lonely  and  giving  them a
reassuring lick.  Thus, even the most  accomplished player will not be
able to survive for  long  on  the  advanced  levels.   Hard should be
harder, but not on a 'Lasers and  Men' scale.  However that said, this
is a minor gripe in a great game.  Playing against a human opponent is
yet more satisfying  and  although  sharing  the  same  controls means
constant seat-swopping which can get a  little annoying, these are all
minor irritations which are cheerfully  cast  aside  since the game is
such a classic one.

     There is no music, only a  dreadfully  loud looping sample on the
front-end of the  game  and  a  series  of in-game explosions/whooping
laughs which result on  use  and  accuracy  of  weaponry.   They are a
little obvious/cliched, but at  least  the  Gower  Bros.  have made an
effort.   Having  hackneyed  but  functional  samples  is  better than
having silence or chip noises.  Just don't plug headphones direct into
the computer because you may be starring in your own version of 'Event
Horizon' and cleaning blood out of your ears for some time to come..

     There ARE a few bugs  in  the  game,  sometimes  you get an error
message (which  is  a  STOS  version  of  a  crash).   There  are also
graphical bugs where it doesn't always clear bits off the screen.  And
just exactly how the  worm's  reaction  to  being bombed is calculated
seems vastly irrational: sometimes  your  worm makes miraculous flying
jumps to land safely when you thought  it was a goner for sure.  Other
times it seems as safe  as  a  toadstool  in  hell, but actually still
manages to throw itself off a precipice,  terrorized by the noise of a
plasma-ray two screens away.  So  maybe  Battlezone  does have more in
common with Lemmings.. suicidal tendencies seem to run through both.
