Hi, here is Michael of RDT speaking - the guys who are
developing this funky game for your pleasure.

I think that you have read about our game Running before.
Maybe you already have played the free shareware version
(released in may this year). For all those Falcon users who don't
know what I mean, please visit our homepage at:


http://stio1.fh-wuerzburg.de/student/i381


This website offers news about the actual development.
You are able to download the shareware version which
includes the full playable first level for free !

Or look for the files "runshar1.zip" / "runshar2.zip" on
wellknown FTP servers.


Ok, that's it for the download arena so far. But what about the game ?

Here are the facts ...



ÅGameplayÄ

Running is a 3D shooter like Duke Nukem on PC.
Your hero has to solve five huge episodes. In each episode
you have to complete two missions and finally find the exit.

But there are a lot of different bad guys making live hard.
Of course there are tons of ammo and energy packs,
different weapons (pistol, shotgun, flamethrower, ...),
Äspecial items (motion tracker, night viewer, ...) and ACTION !!!
Explore strange buildings, moving platforms and secret doors ...

Watch the screen shots !



ÅTechnical detailsÄ

We offer complex room structures and textures using the
Falcon true color mode (32000 colours). All textures are
rendered. Besides that we included a lot of sound samples
and .... a talking hero !!!

There are a lot of different screen modes for maximum speed on
every Falcon !

Our game don't need any special Falcon. The standard version
with 16MHz, 4 MB ram, VGA/RGB monitor is enough.



ÅRelease DateÄ

The final version of Running will be released in
october this year. This is no joke !



ÅOrdering and pricingÄ

We have national distribution partners for UK (20 GBP + pp),
USA (30 USD + pp), France and Australia (40 austr. Dollars +pp).
So you donít have to bother about huge transaction fees or stuff
like that. Customers from Germany and all other countries
not mentioned above can directly order Running at RDT
(see for address at the end of the article).
The prices will be 35 US Dollar
Äfor all foreign countries, 59 DM for
Germany (INCLUDED PP).



PLEASE DO NOT ORDER NOW ! Wait for the official release !
When the time is right, we will give even more detailed
informations about
the ordering procedure !



ÖAttention !Ä

We won't include the level editor and the multiplayer
option in the final version. We think we have done our part
developing the
game so far. Now it is time for the ATARI community
to show us their interest in this game and
support us - please buy a registered
version of RUNNING !

We have worked for a very long time to release this
game. However, we offer the game for a very
fair price. Calculating a little
bit, you can see, that selling Falcon games wonít make you rich.
We are driven by a strong vision to bring you a great game - so
donít disappoint us !

One thing is for sure: if we get some reasonable amount of
money back, we will release a multiplayer option for free !
It is your decision.



Michael.

In the name of RDT.
