There are some programs which just command attention. CAB grabbed 
us allwhen it was still entitled "HTML Browser" and worked off
line. STiK kicked NOS directly into touch when it appeared (there 
is a bit of a theme going on here). Now as essential as either 
off these to any self respecting Atari Netter comes "Newsie", an 
intergrated newsgroup - email - and FTP package(„Hurrah€).

Newsie's main strength is basically that it is better („in my€ 
„opinion€) than anything else currently available for the STiK 
network layer as far as email goes. Up until now email has had to 
go through 'Ant Mail' which although perfectly adequatedoes 
not really go far enough to contend with offerings on other 
platforms. Additionally it seems to be no longer actively 
supported so Newsie is definitely worth a look to replace the 
Email side of your set up.

On the FTP side of things Newsie is God, sorry there is no two 
ways about this,as the only other contender is MGFTP 103 which is 
slower than my pet sloath after a nights bingeingon valium. 
Newsie beats MGFTP hands down by basically having faster screen 
updates and an extremely easy windowpoint'n'click interface. No 
need to wait for screen updates while FTPin' ever again („Hurrah€).

The newsgroup side of things is basically an extension of the 
email system but who's complaining about that with a program like 
this.

Other natty little features include HTML browsing....well kind of. 
Using this option presents you with a window full of the Homepage 
source code, although clicking on the links actually work. Viewing 
pages this waymay not be as aesthetically pleasing as CAB but its 
fast, effective, and a good way to learn how to code HTML by the 
example of others.

Well that was me raving about how good the program is compared with 
what is currently available,but what actually awaits you on start 
up of the program. After the program has finished loading and the 
autologins to newsgroups has done its thing you are greated with a 
well designed but standard gem menu system with ALL („in captials €
„'cos there are alot of them€)options held in its various menu, of
course all have short cuts which are in the standard german 
(„surprise, surprise€) configuration. However even though there are 
mountains of options everything is well defined and you should have 
no difficulty in finding the option you want.This is a good example 
of how to design a menu system.

In conclusion (at last) this is a top program that can only get 
better.If this were the late 'ST Format' I'd giv it a 'Format Gold' 
but it isn't so, I can't. Shame.

This review was in no way biased from the start ;-)
