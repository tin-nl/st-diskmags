Interview with Colin Polonowski, the head of Croft Soft Software,
who produce an HTML magazine known as The Atari Times.

(Please note, Col, you can answer the questions with as much or
as little detail as you want, but try to answer with more than
just one or two words, please. )


Can you give us a few details about yourself, where you were born,
attended schools, career etc:-

I was born in Bristol Maternity Hospital on 21st December 1997. I went
to North Road County Primary School and then onto Brimsham Green
School(both in Yate, near Bristol) where I stayed to do my A Levels.

At the moment I'm studying for a degree in computing at the University
of the West of England. After that I hope to go on to do something to
dowith computers - as long as it doesn't involve working for Microsoft
I'mhappy!

Next year I've got to go on a years placement and I am looking into
thepossibility of working for a company in America during that time.
I'mnot sure if this will happen but it IS something I'd like to do,
it'dalso look pretty good on my CV!


How did you start off in the world of hobbyist computing ?

I first became interested in computers in my first year at primary  
school! 

I got own computer, a Sinclair Spectrum, one Christmas - I must have 
been about 5. I didn't even get to use it before my dad plugged the 
€joystick interface in the back while it was on and blew it up!!!

It was the games which I really liked and I didn't think there was 
anything else it could do until I read the manual - about two years 
later!

By the time I left primary school I was the computer expert :)

What prompted you to set up Croft Soft Software ?

I got interested in writing programs when I was about 8 years old! I 
didn't do anything spectacular and most of the things I did were copied
straight out of books!

My first attempts at programming on my own involved a few small
adventure games - one of which Terror of the Deep I sent off to a
company. I was surprised to see MicroProse release a PC game a while
back called Terror FROM the Deep - I always wondered if they nicked
myname!

Croft Soft never really got started until I got my Atari. I found the
Shoot 'em up Construction kit on budget and bought it straight away. 
Thefirst game I released, The Fuzzles, must have been one of the 
worst games ever written on any system! I managed to release about ten
games written with SEUCK - most of which were the same! One that I was
happy with though was an educational maths game called Ladybird Maths!

I moved on to STOS fairly quickly and thats when Croft Soft began to  
take off. The first STOS game I wrote was Aerial Combat ST - based on
anAmiga game called Biplanes. This was the first in a series of Aerial  
Combat games, the last of which was the first one I wrote to make use
of the STE's extra features.

The last two years have been the best for me. Trader was the first (and  
only) game that made me any money - around  A330! Things have picked up  
even more since I started with the Atari Times...

€
What Atari systems do you own ? Please describe your setup.

I've become a bit of an Atari freak over the last five years! 

It started with my STE which has been upgraded over time, it now has 4  
MByte of memory, a 127 MByte MiniS Hard Drive, two monitors (Colour and  
Mono) and a Canon Bubblejet printer.

Next came the Lynx, it may be the most powerful handheld available but  
TBH the games I've got for it aren't really anything special!

After that I got a Jaguar which really impressed me at first. I added a  
Jag CD to that a few months later - together it came to less than A3100  
brand new so I was happy!. I must admit however, since I got a Sony  
PlayStation the Jag has taken a bit of a back seat!

I got my Falcon just a little while back - it was originally Frank  
Charltons and it came with a great selection of software. The Falcon 
has4Mbyte of memory (a bit limiting, especially with MagiC!), 65 Mbyte  
internal Hard Drive, TOS 4.04 and a maths co-processor. I did have a
VGAmonitor which cost me  A330 but it broke about 2 weeks after I 
bought itso atm I am using the Atari colour monitor. I also use the 
ST's Hard Drive.


Which are your favourite demos on the ST, STE and Falcon ?

I'm not really much of a demo person. I've only seen a few - hardly any  
of which I can remember. I have got Grotesque for the STE which was  
really good.

I've been meaning to get hold of a few Falcon demos to show it off to
myfriends but I never seem to get around to it!!


What are your favourite games of all time, on any system ?
€
Until recently my favourite game was Civilization on the ST, this has
somuch depth its unbelievable. This has only recently been surpassed
by Civilization II on my PC!

Other than that, Frontier is also an excellent game. The fact that it  
runs really smoothly on the Falcon is a bonus.

However, the one game that I'll always remember is Caves of Doom on the  
Speccy. It may not have the depth or even the level of gameplay of  
modern games, but it was the first ever computer game I bought and I
canstill even today play on it for hours - and I still haven't 
completedit!

We hear you also have a PC. What do you use this for ?

The main reason for getting the PC was to help with my university  
course. I needed to be able to use the same software at home in order
todo some of the assignments.

The fact is, the PC has turned more into a gaming machine now!

I also use it to put together the vast majority of the Atari Times. 
It'snot that the PC does a better job - I used to use the STE to do  
everything - it's just that the PC is faster.

I also use PaCifiST - the excellent Atari emulator. It is one of the  
most remarkable emulators I have ever seen - its so compatible that
evenlots of games run on it!

What prompted you to start in comms and why do you call 42BBS ?

I first got interested in comms while reading an article in Atari 
World.It said how comms didn't need to be an expensive hobby and that
it couldbe very useful...

It has in fact become very expensive, but without having access to it I  
€doubt that I'd be an Atari user today :(

I actually started commsing with Chameleon run by Martin Stacey, mainly  
due to the fact that it was situated about half a mile from where I  
live. I used to cheat a bit and get 42_Local through the Chameleon  
message base. When Martin decided to shut Chameleon down 42BBS was the  
obvious choice!

It is not a decision I regret. With all the support from the 42BBS
usersI have managed to make the Atari Times last, and without the help
ofColin Fisher-McAllum and everyone else there I think AT would have
dieda long time ago.

Your thoughts are welcomed on the following subjects:-


Atari Computing

Well, what can I say?

It took a lot of courage to invest in a new Atari magazine, especially  
this late on. Thankfully it looks like it paid off for them and its  
doing very well.

IMO, Atari Computing is the best thing to happen in the Atari market
fora long time - its almost certainly the best magazine in the last
fewyears.


Movie censorship

I think that people should really be able to make up their own minds  
about what they see and by stopping people from watching things they
may want to is just asking for trouble.

A recent example can be seen with the film Crash which a number of 
people- mainly led by the Daily Mail - tried to ban. This just 
€increased thelevel of publicity for the film and made more people 
aware of it.

I haven't seen the film but from what I've heard it isn't really very  
good - it only managed to get audiences due to the press's coverage of  
it.

Then again I suppose that there has got to be some sort of shield  
against films which are purely pornographic for example.


Software piracy

I've never personally had any pirated software - mainly due to the fact  
that hardly anyone I know ever had an Atari.The problem isn't really as  
bad in the Atari market these days,but in the PC world it is a very big  
problem.

It is fairly obvious why it happens, you've just got to look at the  
prices charged for games these days.I remember when full price software  
used to cost just 10 ukp, today you'd be lucky to find a budget game at  
that price.

Who's going to pay around 45 ukp for a game when they can copy it off a  
friend for free. I dont agree with it but there is very little that can  
be done to stop it.

Piracy has recently reappeared on the Atari - this unfortunately can be  
attributed to PaCifiST.People are taking illegal copies of TOS ROMs and  
there are a number of pirated games available on the Internet. It would  
be so bad if the software available this way was not also being  
distributed legally by a number of Atari companies. Most of these  
companies have been Atari supporters for a long time and it is unfair
tothem.


Mike Goodman's crop of Atari shows
€

These just go to show that there is still quite a lot of life in the  
Atari world. There is no way Mike could put these shows on if there  
wasn't the level of support from Atari users that there is now.

I doubt there are many other people who would put the time and effort  
into organising events as big as the shows!

The shows themselves are helping to keep the Atari market afloat and  
each one has seen the launch of a number of big releases. I just hope  
that there will be more next year!


Coding conventions (Siliconvention etc)

I've never actually been to one, but from what I understand they are  
supposed to be a good laugh! Some of the things that I have seen  
resulting from these conventions have been pretty amazing...

I'd like to go to one at some point but I can't really afford to! Maybe  
one day :)


ST+ Diskzine

Dave Hollis is doing a very good job with ST+. Along with Maggie,  
AtariPhile, and (of course!) Atari Times it plays an important part in  
todays Atari market.

I haven't read many issues, but from what I've seen it is an excellent  
read and I'll try to read every issue from now on :)


Glastonbury '97 (even if you didn't go, what did you think ?)

Muddy - thats the first thing than comes to mind :)
€
There was a very good line-up there and I would have liked to have 
gone.  

Mind you, I wouldn't have liked getting E-Coli from the cowpatsthere..


The Prodigy

Excellent!

The Prodigy are one of the best British dance groups around. 
Firestarterand Poison are my favourites but most of their other tracks
are pretty good too :)


Roy Goring

Well, I can honestly say that this is one thing I have never been asked  
for my opinion on!!!

I've never actually met Roy in person - maybe I will at one of the  
upcoming WAG meetings which I never seem to arrive at!

>From what I can tell though, Roy seems to be a good bloke!


Swampy (The infamous 'Newbury' protestor)

I saw Swampy on Have I Got News For You one week and he seemed quite  
quiet - not something you'd expect for someone who protests as strongly  
as he does to some things (such as the Newbury Bypass)!

I haven't been to Newbury yet (although I will be if I actually make it  
to a WAG meeting!) so I can't really say whether or not I agree with 
hisprotests. It does seem that there are a number of roads being built
that aren't really needed, especially around where I live!
€

George Clooney (actor, ER)

I haven't had the chance to see George Clooney in any TV or films yet 
soI can't really say much about him!

From what I have seen in TV interviews and things, he seems like a more  
down to earth person than most other US film stars!


Who are your favourite actors and actresses in TV or the movies ?

I'm a bit of a Star Trek freak so their may be a bit of a Star Trek 
biasin this answer!

Andrew Robinson who plays the Cardassian Garak in Deep Space Nine and  
who also starred in the film Hellraiser is one of the best actors I can  
think of at the moment. Also, Mark Alaimo - another Cardassian from DS9  
is an excellent actor, he's had small parts in a number of other TV  
series and films.

My favourite actresses are Nana Vistor (yet again from DS9), Claire  
Danes and Sandra Bullock. Nana Visitor is probably the better of the 
twoas she portrays here character excellently. Sandra Bullock and 
Claire Danes on the other hand are the two best actresses to emerge for
quite a long time.


Which music groups do you like ? (Spice Girls don't count as a group.)

[Sarcastic mode on]

Oh damn, and I was going to say that the Spice Girls were my  
favourite... I mean,their lyrics are just amazing and their records are  
brilliant...

€[Sarcastic mode off]

No seriously though, I like most kinds of music and I've got albums 
from loads of different groups. At the moment, my favourites are Ocean
ColourScene and Garbage, although until recently Alanis Morissette was
getting a lot of play on my stereo! 

I also like the new single by Meredith Brooks.

Other groups I like include...

Sleeper, Alishas Attic, Manics, Lightning Seeds, Sheryl Crow, Dodgy,  
Lighthouse Family, Prodigy, Offspring, Republica and Soundgarden...

Croft Softs main area of work now is in writing the Atari Times - a  
rougly bi-monthly disk mag in the HTML format. It carries the latest  
Atari news along with news from Croft Soft and also reviews of the  
latest Atari software. There are a number of ongoing series including  
our popular User Profile section which each issue profiles a well-known  
Atarian.

Mole Mayhem is our next game which seems to have been in development
fora verrrrryyyyyy long time. This is mainly due to the lack of time I  
have to do it. It will hopefully be released within the next couple of  
months - no promises though! It is an old fashioned platform game  
written for the STE - it will hopefully be Falcon compatible but at the  
moment I am having some problems getting it to work correctly. It will  
require 1 MByte and will beinexpensive.

My other project are the Croft Soft Internet Publications web pages - a  
group of pages that I have created. They include Croft Soft on the 'Net  
which carries the latest Croft Soft information and also the latest  
Atari news. The Atari Times Homepage which really speaks for itself,  
€here you can download issues of the magazine, read a selection of  
articles from previous issues as well as read the latest issue. The  
Unexplained is the other main set of pages. Basically this covers all  
things paranormal from Ghosts to UFO's. 

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, my own personal homepage is there too where  
you can find out all about me!

All of my web pages are constantly being updated, so you can be sure of  
getting the most up to date information possible!
