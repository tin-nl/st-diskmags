Over the past year or so, the 4k intro has grown into a real artform.
It really started to blossom at the  Symposium 96 when the vacuum left
by the lack of decent big demos  was  filled by a cluster of fantastic
4ktros. TSCC did some  neat  morphing  wireframe  3D,  Lazer and Inter
created an incredible texture mapped 3D world and Spirits took the top
prize with a truly awesome fire  effect  (  and some sad god bothering
text ).

Sonoulumiszenz may have taken all  the plaudits at the Siliconvention,
but Llama of TSCC's 4ktro turned  just  as many heads. Bump mapping on
the ST in 4k - a truly astonishing achievement.

So the tradition of 4ktros  on  the  Falcon is now firmly established.
The Orneta party in Poland gave demo crews a chance to release more of
their amazingly compact effects.

At the Maggie office we were all a  bit surprised to hear that DHS had
released a brilliant 4ktro at this  party.  DHS are one of those crews
that have been around  since  the  start  of  the  Falcon, but haven't
really been very productive. Sure, they  have perhaps the best website
of all the atari crews, but they haven't really been very prolific.

Last years Demolition was a good  demo, without being outstanding. For
such a large  demo,  it  had  comparitively  few  effects, relying too
heavily on a rot-zoomer. Demolition kept DHS firmly in the demo coding
second division, and chances of promotion were looking slim.

DHS just smiled to themselves.  They  knew  they could do better. They
would show the world how good  they  were. With the release of '4ever'
they have put all the doubters  to the sword and effortlessly ascended
into the demo crews premier league.

Isn't this a bold statement? 4ever is just a 4ktro after all.

Wrong. 4ever isn't just a 4ktro. It is the 4ktro. The best 4k intro on
the Falcon. Ever.

Watching 4ever for the first time is reminiscent of your first viewing
of the classic Inter/TSCC 96ktro  'Terrorise  Your Soul'. "There can't
possibly be any more effects" you say, and then there are!

4ever begins with a nice full screen rotzoomer. The demo name and crew
and printed out onto grey tiles which are overlayed on a background of
shaded circles. Each word  rotates  and  spins  at  us  for a bit then
scrolls off.

We are then propelled into the  next  effect - a fantastic bump mapper
which easily beats the TSCC one. To be fair, DHS have the advantage of
working in higher colour modes, but even  so  this is the best 4k bump
mapper ever seen. Its not just  a  tiny  portion of the screen that is
illuminated, just about every pixel  gets  some effect from the strong
lightsource ever frame. Great stuff.

I must admit that when I first saw this demo I thought the bump mapper
would be the only effect and then it would end. Boy, I was so wrong!

A nice tunnel effect then  apears.  This  doesn't  feature one of your
standard plasma type textures, instead  you  have a nice multi-layered
construct which a  cylindrical  grid  overlaying  some  shade circles.

Again,  a  very  nice   effect   especially   considering  the  memory
constraints.

And its still not over.

Next the screen fills with a  flock  of  bobs.  ( a battalion of bobs?
what is the collective noun for  bobs?  ).  Aha - shadebobs! You think
smugly. And again you  are  wrong.  The  bobs  rotate  and spin around
leaving slight trails, but they all  have motion blur on them. Another
great effect.

Surely this is it.

But no, DHS have saved the best  until  last. Its a tunnel effect. But
its no ordinary tunnel effect - its a BUMP-MAPPED TUNNEL! And it looks
absolutely fucking gorgeous. It is at this point that you realise just
how talented these guys are and  that  you are watching the best 4ktro
ever.

The demo even ends neatly with the  same rotzoomer as at the beginning
bearing the legend "The  End".  It  even  quits  perfectly back to the
desktop. Seamless.

So there we have it. The best  ever  4k intro. DHS have created a demo
that is quite simply un4gettable.

TECH VIEW: Yay! This more like it! DHS come up trumps with a 4K intro 
that shows really good design in its underlying code. The decision to 
use the FPU may annoy some quarters, but it's a revelation in the 4K 
department where difficult calculations can be reduced to just a 
couple of bytes to precalc all those nasty bits. It also allows a nice 
smooth and precise rotation since the FPU includes sine tables.

  In fact there are only a few relatively simple routines used in this 
demo: for example there's a "circle" drawer, a rotater, a tunnel 
calculator, a bump mapper, a blur effect. Each of these need only 
occupy a couple of hundred bytes. But the trick is to be able to 
combine these effects to create new ones (e.g. to pipe the output from 
the bump mapper into the tunnel effect) and DHS do it brilliantly.

Time to dig my FPU docs out... [tat]
