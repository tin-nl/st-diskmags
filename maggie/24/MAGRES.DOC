     Deep on the edge of Wales.. in Powys (which incidentally voted no
to a Welsh Assembly) lies the  home  of the Reservoir Gods... a rather
venerable old timber-frame cottage,  which  hosted  more  Falcons in a
single room than most people will encounter in their entire life-times
(that's 5 ;).

     Those attending were all members of  the Reservoir Gods, with the
exception of Arnel who was just a nice guy.
€
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Beginning...


Thursday September 11th:

13:00     sh3 and MSG arrive by train, staggering under bags of
          Falcons, CDs, CD-writer, Hard-drives..

13:05     Mr Pink proposes a walk to the pub for lunch.. unsuspecting
          sh3 and MSG eagerly comply, Ripley less eagerly..

13:06     MSG asks: "Are we there yet?" for the 5th time.  Mr Pink
          laughs and strides on.

13:10     first barbed-wire fence encountered, no blood-spilt as yet,
          although several pints of MSG's coat are left behind..

13:20     begin detour in order to avoid field of vicious looking-cows
          who seem interested in Mr Pink's pink boots

13:25     MSG succeeds in breaking the barbed-wire he is standing on
          and is therefore left hanging onto a very thin tree branch,
          dangling over a nice ravine.  He decides to climb under the
          fence rather than over it while everyone else is busy
          laughing

13:26     Mr Pink leads everyone back into the field of cows by
          mistake.. much cursing later we return to the old field and
          carry on

13:30     climb down sheer bank with stream at bottom, Mr Pink
          comments "We're coming to the easy bit now".  MSG complains
          about spiky things which Ripley informs him are known as
          thistles by the local, country-types
€
13:35     MSG asks what a stile is and what it's for and why people
          don't just climb over the gate.  MSG is last.

13:36     find path through forest, Mr Pink vanishes, Ripley takes
          the middle, sh3 and MSG give each other encouragement at the
          rear..

13:40     forest track seems deceptively long, mutinous mutterings
          heard from the rear

13:45     civilisation! there is a road somewhere to the .. er
          right-ish area where all that noise is coming from

13:47     Mr Pink climbs up sheer bank to spy-out land.. spots pub!
          Doesn't know how he climbed up, has to slide down..

13:48     giant, spor-erupting puff-ball encountered and stepped on..
          MSG asks if it's alive and side-steps just to be sure

13:49     Tarmac!

13:50     The Pub!

14:00     Pub closes..  Mr Pink in deep trouble.. :)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Quote of the convention:

Mr Pink: "Going to bed sucks!" [spoken  at some ridiculous hour of the
morning after he has returned from going to bed]
----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Last year's Cwmvention spawned  the  Reservoir  Gods game 'Sworm'
[among other things] coded in a  mere  24 hours..  This years' 24 hour
€game was a competition to code a  Macho-man* clone and saw Ripley draw
an exhausting 5 separate sprite-characters (each of some 20 frames) in
about 3 hours,  then  saw  her  collapse  laughing  hysterically for a
further half an hour  due  to  temporary  sprite-induced madness.  The
sprites can be seen  on  the  PC  game  'Hammered', coded by Reservoir
Gods' member Yoshica, which won the competition.

     The contest was hardly  the  most  bitterly contested, with Arnel
going to  bed  immediately  after  Mr  Pink's  'C'  tutorial, followed
quickly by Tim.  And with  Mr  Pink's  own  game: 'Bunion Canyon' only
scoring highly  on  the  crap  name  stakes  ..   Hammered  should  be
available on the Gods web-page  reasonably  soon  and Bunion Canyon is
due for release as soon as Mr Pink has found someone who'll draw him a
logo.. sh3 having refused on  the  aforementioned grounds.  Offers are
therefore very welcome..

     *For those unaware, Macho-man  is  a  game which involves jumping
through moving holes in a series  of  platforms in an attempt to reach
the top of the screen ..  it's  probably  older than Gem Breakout, but
you never know since the fossil record still contains a few gaps.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Moment of the convention:

watching the sun rise at about 06:40  .. amazing vivid pink slivers of
cloud with indigo and cyan coloured  patches  of sky, worth staying up
for (just:)
----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Mr Pink's mum was out of a job this year, with her cooking skills
being superseded by  MSG's  noodle-making  skills.   Despite having to
cook for seven, his noodles were  always  of  a flexible yet not soggy
consistency and there were compliments all  round, except from sh3 and
Tim who had the  strange  unpronounceable  Czechoslovakian flavour and
who both reported it to  be  the  most  disgusting thing they had ever
€tasted.  Pizza was voted second best  after  noodles, with Coke and Dr
Pepper vying for the rear..

     During stock-taking, the local Safeways  was  a little bemused to
find that it had sold out of  3  months  supply of noodles in a single
day.. the Gods had arrived in town!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Indigenous Words of the convention:

Weak.. as spoken by MSG about everyone/everything apart from himself.
Worming.. MSG and  sh3's  habit  of  retracting  themselves into their
sleeping-bags to hibernate for different durations of time, varying in
length from all day to several days..
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Having numerous games of Pool at the local pub, not only provided
instant entertainment for those  involved,  but  caused Phoenix on IRC
much bemusement after Mr Pink told  him (falsely) that he had thrashed
Ripley and MSG at pool..  "They  were  in the pool together??" Phoenix
was seen to ask a trifle bemused..

     Tim turned out to be the cool pool God, with Yoshica showing very
frequent flashes of brilliance..

     Arnel and Ripley were just happy when they hit the ball (any ball
that is).

     Having frequented the said pub  so  much, the Gods were cordially
invited to join the Pub  Outing  to Blackpool.. they equally cordially
€declined..


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Amusing moment:

Being asked where we were  from  by  the  landlord  of our local pub..
probably due  to  MSG's  dodgy  American  accent  and  sh3's  frequent
comments about San Francisco..
----------------------------------------------------------------------


     By the second day  it  was  not  unusual  to see various sleeping
bodies lying around the computer room; while the seemingly unstoppable
Mr Pink finally succumbed to  his  mortality  (on  the fourth day) and
actually went to bed early, Ripley preferred  the half of the sofa not
being occupied by MSG.  Sh3  possessed  an amazing, superhuman ability
which allowed him to sleep anywhere, at  any time of the day, with any
amount of noise, on whatever he  happened  to be lying: sofas, floors,
pieces of broken glass, sharp nails.  Very uncanny.

     Yoshica meanwhile had to endure night-time  in the room above the
garage which is shared in equal  proportions with mice, bats, spiders,
moths, flies and various other unnameable life-forms.  All of which he
swore, could be felt crawling over his sleeping bag - no wonder he won
the award for least time spent sleeping..  :)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Most viewed demo:
Hmm tough one this.. probably won by  Sono  on account of it being the
best and most recent Falcon demo with  which to attempt to impress the
PC dads..
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     A flying, guest appearance was  made  by  thirdEye who could only
drop in for 10 minutes since  she  was between photo-shoots and had to
€be seen in Tokyo by 3.  She did however have time to write a quick mod
for  the  contest,  which  was  enough  to  put  her  on  top  of  the
competition, a position she always likes to  be in (as MSG will inform
you..;)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Worst Moment of the convention:

Getting to the pub 10  minutes  before it stopped serving.. especially
as this happened every time we went.. :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

     A  distinct  lack  of  enthusiasm  afflicted  the  Cricket  Game,
obviously it was a little soon  after  tea (ie noodles) and there were
casualties for both Yorkshire  and  Lancashire.   Sh3  made up for his
non-participation by deciding to code a  cricket game in Pascal (which
he subsequently finished and  entered  into  the mild contest, killing
off any other competition there might have been)..

     The story of  how  the  wild  competition  mutated  into the mild
competition is one to  demand  off  MSG  who  was  the creator of both
genres.  However the  original  wild  comp.  was  unofficially  won by
Yoshica, Ripley, MSG and sh3  who  ventured  out into the forest after
midnight just for the hell of it.  Now how wild is that?
