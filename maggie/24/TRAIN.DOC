STAGES.  SERIOUS TRAUMA COULD RESULT UNLESS HEEDED..

NOTICE:
We have a door-policy on  this  article  so  unless  you are wearing a
greasy anorak with grass stains  on  the  elbows and digestive biscuit
crumbs in the pockets, and unless you are the proud owner of a thermos
flask filled with a weak lemon  drink,  and unless you are wearing NHS
glasses with 3 inch  concave  lenses  and  clutching a grubby notebook
filled with adolescent doodles  ...  then,  after reading this article
you could well fit that  description  because  this is: A Trainspotter
Article, ONLY for the timid and fainthearted.  You have been warned..

HOW TO BECOME A TRAINSPOTTER:
The following is a list of  challenging questions designed to make you
feel really really special if you can answer them and total inadequate
if you can't..  so, happy spotters, here's your instructions (remember
to write them down carefully  and  neatly  in  your  jotter so you can
refer back to them  just  in  case!  (Dwayne  always goes prepared for
everything remember!)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Go through the questions in  order,  writing your answers carefully in
your notebook, once you reach the  end  you will arrive at the ANSWERS
section and before you read this you  must add up your score (ask your
mum to help you if your score reaches double figures)..
€
     There is 1 point awarded  for  each  question (thus if a question
asks you for 3 facts you must know all of them to gain the mark - it's
just so eeezE!)

     Finally check the HOW DID YOU DO! table  to see how you rate as a
serious Trainspotter.
