              ÅNEAR DISASTER AT WIGAN PIER PLAICE STATIONÄ

           Ñfrom our scientific correspondant Justone O'LevelsÄ

"We were just five seconds  from  total  disaster.  We are so close to
meltdown. If it had got any hotter  that  would have been it - the big
bang". Eric Hairslide, manager of Wigan  Pier's top chippy "The Plaice
Station", shuddered as  he  related  the  catastrophic  events  of the
previous sunday evening. "I've been running  this place for five years
and the technology has just given us constant grief."

Eric explained his  predicament  "We  have  a  fully computerised chip
shop. We use  the  computers  for  everything:  the accounts, letters,
playing solitaire. Well actually, we don't  use it for letters because
we couldn't get the printer driver working properly on windows 95. And
the accounts  package  keeps  crashing.  But  we  can  certainly  play
solitaire. Oh yes!"

So what  happened  on  that  fateful  night  of  near  calamity?  "The
computers went  down.  There  I  was  serving  Mr  Pilkington  - large
portion, jumbo sausage, brown sauce as  usual!  - and there was a loud
shout from upstairs. Turns out the  computer had crashed again just as
my wife was trying to save  an  amazing  birthday cake design on 'Walt
Disney's "The Little Mermaid" Birthday Cake  Maker for Windows 95'. So
I was up  there  going  through  all  this  safe  mode  gubbins and Mr
Pilkington's jumbo sausage was there  in  the microwave getting bigger
and bigger just about to  explode! Fortunately young Sam Arsetrembler,
right little tearwaway that un, was  just  at that moment leaning over
the hot pies counter trying to steal  a handful of plastic forks - why
can't they take just one? You  only  have  one mouth don't you? Anyway
little Sam slipped and fell into  our  "Help The Aged Donkeys" display
knocking the cardboard placard over  and  causing  me to run back down
the stairs and save the sausage."

"I blame the technology, if we  had  up  to date technology this would
never have happened." He complained.

ÄFortunately for Eric,  help  was  at  hand  in  the  form of supershot
American technology  and  cod  expert,  Michael  Bonkers.  Michael was
excited about his trip to the Pier  Plaice  Station - "I'm going to be
the first British born guy to set foot in Wigan." He Drawled. "It will
be a great honour for me".

Michael was appalled  at  the  impoverished  conditions  in the Plaice
station. "How can they  work  with  technology  so  outdated? They are
running Windows 98 which is now  at  least  3  weeks old! And they are
running a 200mhz  MMX  Pentium!  Haha!  How  do  they  expect  to play
solitaire and write a few letters with  that? Their sound card is just
32 bit. I told them, the windows  warning  bell sounds a heck of a lot
better in 64 bit. How  can  they  work  in  such conditions? No wonder
accidents are happening."

World leaders  were  quick  to  criticise  the  use  of  such outmoded
hardware. "If people want to take  this country seriously, " said Tony
Blair "then we have to take our  computers seriously. That means a new
computer for ever household ever week! And new faster windows! And new
faster memory! And new sound cards! New 3D cards! New hard drives! New
Labour! New computers! New  bank  overdraft!  When  do  I mention that
information byway thing Peter?".

Others were less upbeat. The President of  the USA, Mr Bill Gates said
"Europe has always been  way  behind  the  United States in technology
terms. They may wait weeks before buying new software or hardware - by
that time it is obviously out  of  date.  I'm  lobbying for UN laws to
force people to buy Microsoft software  the  day it is released. It is
the only way tragedies like that of the Jumbo sausage can be avoided."

Eric was full of remorse. "I now know  that to use notepad to its full
potential I will need a 300Mhz  machine  with  128mb RAM, 24 speed CD-
ROM, Windows NT 5.0, 8 gig hard disk  and at least an 18 inch monitor.
I have just been  kidding  myself  that  I  could  get away with using
lesser technology and putting the lives of staff at risk."

Bill Gates is 98 million dollars richer today.
