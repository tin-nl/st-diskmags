                             SHIPS v1.0:
                       a game for ST and Falcon
                    programmed by Adam Klobukowski


     Have you ever heard of  'No  Frills'  food?   Of course you have.
Well this is  a  game  following  the  same  principles  -  instead of
gorgeous, rendered intro pictures,  haunting  symphonies  of sound and
elaborately intricate fonts, we  have  no  intro  and the system font.
Well at  least  it's  not  a  awful  game  hiding  behind  a  huge and
irrelevantly  protracted  intro  as   some   games  we  could  mention
(Clockwork Sold- Snip! Libelous  Ed).   It's  humble,  it's honest and
it's even beautiful in  its  naked  simplicity.   Hmm..  I think I was
drifting off somewhere there  (either  that  or  I've been reading too
much D.H. Lawrence...).

     Okay, SHIPS is the old  game  Battleships,  in which both players
hide 10 ships on a 10x10  grid  then  take  turns to blast away at the
board until one person is lucky  enough to discover/destroy all of the
other players' ships.  In this version  you can only play against  the
machine, so the name-calling and gloating is sadly all one way (unless
€disk whirring noises and miscellaneous chip contraction cracks count).
The game is as ancient as  Gem  Breakout  and we all know that cavemen
were playing that with bones and rocks don't we?  Oh yes.

     Adam Klobukowski (any relation to Adamski we wonder?) is the sole
brain behind SHIPS, as  he  credits  himself  with programming & ideas
(although exactly  what  sort  of  ideas  are  needed  for  a  game as
proverbial as battleships and  just  how  much programming he actually
carried out are points for hot debate).

     As most coders turned gfx artists,  (Ed Cleeveland is a notorious
exception) Adam's artistic skills are  NOT  to be noted.  The graphics
are less then functional.  They are ..  poor.  No, I'm being too nice,
they are nonexistent.  Not  only  are  they  uninspired, they are also
confusing.  The symbol denoting a Wreck (ie a square which contained a
ship which you  subsequently  destroyed)  is  the  same  symbol for an
intact  ship, just in a  different  colour  and pasted over the cursor
symbol, so  as the game progresses, it  is  more difficult to see at a
glance which square the computer is  targeting since there seems to be
a surfeit of cursors  scattered  all  over  the  board.  A few, clear,
varying symbols would not have gone amiss and would hardly have needed
hours of careful construction since the  game  has only two colours if
run from a 4 to  true  colour  desktop  (yes  it's Gem Based) with the
staple black and white filling in  the gaps.  It actually looks better
run from a 2 colour resolution since the symbols are clearer, but even
so they're nothing to  induce  mass  hysteria  (or  even a letter from
'Disgusted of Tumbridge-Wells').

     To it's credit, SHIPS is  very  user-friendly, it boots easily in
high resolutions and  all  necessary  info  for  playing  the  game is
written clearly and concisely  on  the  gaming  screen,  so no need to
resort to reading the doc [which is in English and also gives clear if
quaint  explanations].  In an age when  actually arriving at a game is
by no means a certainty  [due  to  complex instillation procedures off
ever increasing numbers of floppies with  a tendency to crash on whim,
not  to  mention  various  docs  to  wade  through  often  in  unknown
languages,  with  hideously  complex   instructions,]     SHIPS  is  a
€refreshing breeze: double  click  and  you  can  be  playing  it in an
instant.  However, small as it is,  SHIPS  has  a huge bug which is so
obvious that even though this is version 1.0 it is unforgivable.

     Once you have played one game, it will give you the option: "WONT
TO PLAY AGAIN (Y/n)".. I dutifully typed Y knowing my many and diverse
reviewing  responsibilities.  The gaming screen returned, but with the
old gaming-board, still containing  all  the  old  wrecks.  Thus there
were only a finite number of squares  which  I could shoot at and once
they were all used up  I  couldn't  play  on  since there were no more
available squares  and  I  hadn't  yet  destroyed  all   the  computer
ships...  Either the  coder  never  play-tested  his  own  game, or he
assumed that everyone would type  'n'  to the previous question.  Hmmm
maybe he was right.

     The final feature of  SHIPS  is  that  it  has a saving highscore
table - why is it that all crap  games have these? but I digress, - so
if it is your ambition to see your  name up in.. the system font, then
playing a game of SHIPS  is  liable  to  be  the most enjoyable way of
achieving it, bar loading Protext and typing it.

     But since Adam........ski has taken the  ..  time to program this
.. game and since all he asks for  in  registration is a Postcard or a
phone-call (although he gives warning that his mother knows no English
so be prepared for a barrage of Polish k's and w's).. well we can't be
too hard on the poor  chap.   Everyone  has to start somewhere; humans
progressed from mere worms in the sea, so on the evolutionary scale we
can rest assured that  in  3.5  billion  years  SHIPS  might just have
crawled out of its  primordial  soup  and  grown  wings.  But then, so
might we.

                            BITWA MORSKA:
                       a game for ST and Falcon
                      programmed by Adam  Rogala


     Bitwa  Morska,  translated  from   the  Polish  presumably  means
something akin to Battle Ships, since  the  game has all the necessary
components: a 10x10  grid,  two  players  ('Komputer'  or  'Gracz' (er
vegetable?)) and so on.  Like  SHIPS  it  is ST and Falcon compatible,
but unlike SHIPS it  runs from ST  Low and has   16 sparkling colours,
so immediately   landing an  serious  blow  to  its opponent, with its
€stunning (in comparison) visual impact.

     Okay, the graphics are a little  ..  crude (and chunky because of
the resolution), but setting that aside,  they are nicely cheerful and
above all: clear.  The symbols denoting all the different stages [Ship
/ wreck / unoccupied square which has  been  shot at] are all drawn in
red, but in different shapes and so remain clear and obvious.

     Not only does Bitwa Morska have  more colours than SHIPS, it also
has more ACTION!  When you click on  a square, two cannons in a little
window fire at the horizon: if the square is empty there is a spray of
water and if the square contained  a  ship there is a [red] explosion.
It's touches like this, as well  as  the   fact that in BitwaM you can
play 'Gracz v  Gracz'  as  well  as  against  the  standard 'komputer'
opponent, which make it an enhanced  version  of SHIPS, a few rungs on
up the evolutionary ladder... (with  no  need  to resort to ear-biting
(out of date - Ed))..

     Bitwa also has a demo option,  so  that  you  can watch a game in
progress if all those Polish commands prove too much for you.  However
it's very easy to pick up and so  the demo is a little extraneous, but
we'll commend the coder on his thoughtfulness.

     The actual gameplay differs slightly  to  SHIPS in which you take
only single shots alternatively.  In Bitwa  you  have 10 shots each to
start off with, and the amount of  shots you have decreases if you are
unsuccessful, therefore at one point I  had  8 shots to the computer's

1.  In this respect, it can be difficult to turn a match around if you
have a run of  bad  misses  and  your  opponent  a  run  of good luck.
However I'm not going to  gripe  since  it was intensely satisfying to
opulently scatter shots all over the board while Falc had only the one
single shot.  And it actually makes the  game more fun since, when you
do finally find a ship, you not only have one less to destroy, but the
chances of finding more are increased because your number of shots has
increased.  Again SHIPS sinks  below  the  waves as Bitwa triumphantly
catamarans over the top.. (ouch! - Ed)
€
     Bitwa Morska has SFX, but they  are rather weak [hi Malc!;)] chip
noises (well, very weak: they  sound  as  if  the  coder has sampled a
mouse sneezing self-consciously into a sponge)  - the water hiss noise
for when you shoot at an empty square is almost identical to the noise
when you  successfully destroy a ship.  And a nice, big, mother****ing
explosion wouldn't  have  gone  amiss..:)    Neither  would  a  decent
missile launching roar instead of the rather bathos-inducing:   "phut"
we do get, however we shouldn't  complain  too much since SHIPS has no

SFX at all (but maybe that was just  as well judging by the quality of
the graphics and code...).

     Adam R, like Adam K,  credits  himself  with 'Program + Grafika',
but he has put  so  much  more  effort  into  his  game  that not only
visually  is  it  more  attractive,  but  it  is,  in  itself,  a more
successful game.  SHIPS smacks too much of an amateur's first fumbling
attempt, a view ratified by the glaring bug that assails even the most
fickle of players,  whereas  Bitwa  Morska  bears  the  proud scars of
Thought, Effort and Imagination.

     Put simply, if battleships is your  poison,  then let SHIPS go on
sailing by, but engage Bitwa Morska  and  get ready to do serious Bit-
warring!
