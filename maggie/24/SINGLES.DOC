                          Ñ by Leon O'ReillyÄ


ÅFAITHLESS - DON'T LEAVEÄ

Jamie Catto's ballad is  plundered  from  the heavily milked Reverence
LP. The lazy strings=epic equation is used on the clumsily constructed
main mix, whilst The American Mix  dismally attempts to 'keep it real'
by adding some guitar overdubs. Usually you  can rely on Rollo to come
up with a storming hardbag mix, but  the two house mixes here are very
average. Ç(3/10)Ä

ÅDJ Q - LANDING ON A PLANET NEAR YOUÄ

Paul Flynn celebrates his transfer from Filter  to Go Beat! with an EP
of funky techno. Being  on  the  same  label  as  Portishead and David
Holmes is quite an accolade for young Glaswegian, and shows he has the
skills to pay the bills  with  some  Dave Angel style filtered techno.

ÅUNIVERSAL - MAKE IT WITH YOUÄ

A weak attempt to fill the  large  vacuum  created by the departure of
Take That. Universal are three o-zone  friendly  lads who are no doubt
big with the Smash Hits  massive.  The single highlights their lyrical
dexterity as they manage to rhyme 'with you' with, er, 'with you'. The
bedroom acapella is unintentionally hilarious. A certain hit. Ç(2/10)Ä

ÅBRAND NEW HEAVIES - YOU'VE GOT A FRIENDÄ

The Heavies return with more soul music for accountants. "You've Got A
Friend" is a godsend for  Wine  Bar   muzak compilers - 'nice' lyrics,
sparkling clean production, Mariah  Carey  style vocals, gospel tinged
backing and a 'tune' that leaves your  head the second the track ends.
Not even Todd Terry can to rescue  the track - the heavies are showing
us how to lose friends and influence no-one. Ç(1/10)Ä

ÅSUKIA - GARY SUPER MACHOÄ

Mo Wax's lesbian vampire fanatics return  with  an ode to Gary Lineker
(possibly) . Whilst  not  reaching  the  dizzy  heights  of 'The Dream
Machine',  this  is  still  another   fantastic  slice  of  loungecore
weirdness. Dick Dale  style  surf  guitar,  frantic  breaks, whispered
vocals, mad moog hammering and 'ooo-ahhs'  courtesy of Busta Rhymes on
valium. Ç(7/10)Ä


Ç** DANCE SINGLE OF THE WEEK **Ä
ÅDMITRI FROM PARIS - SACRE FRANCAISÄ

There is a tremendous amount  of  great  music  coming from our Garlic
gobbling cousins at the moment. 'Sacre  Francais' is a brilliant piece
of kitsch disco tinged house. Konishi  Yabuharu's remix is perhaps the
Äpick of the bunch with a generous  helping of drum'n'bass added to the
souffle. 'Vous Dancez  Mademoiselle?'  enquires  a  voice  on the lead
track. Mais oui! Å(9/10)Ä
