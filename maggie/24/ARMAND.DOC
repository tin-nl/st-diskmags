                          ARMAND VAN HELDEN

                 SAMPLESLAYER - ENTER THE MEAT MARKET
Ä
                      Ñ Review By Leon O'ReillyÄ

Armand Van Helden is a man in demand.  His remix of Tori Amos took the
cornflake girl to the top of  the  charts, whilst his reworking of the
Sneaker Pimps "Spin Spin  Sugar"  laid  down  the  blueprint for speed
garage.  But fans of his  house  sound  will  be surprised to discover
that in 'Sampleslayer' Armand has attempted to make a hip hop album.

The album begins inauspiciously with  the  house  of pain style chant-
along "push em up", and then  trundles  through a succession of mainly
weak cuts with tired breaks  and  samples  so  old that they should be
drawing their pension. This are  hip  hop  tracks constructed with all
the skill of a two year old playing with sticklebricks.

Van Helden is so lacking in  ideas  that  he has to regurgitate one of
his old 'hits' to fill out  the  album.  "Ultra Funkula" is just  "The
Funk Phenomena" in baggier pants with  a backwards baseball bat on. To
be fair this is perhaps the  best  track  here - all Daft Punk filters
and DJ Sneak loops. But elsewhere his hardman hip-hop  are laughable -
he is about as 4 real as Mavis from Coronation Street.

Armand has created an album that will  appeal to no-one. Its not funky
enough for the hip-hop heads, not catchy enough for the house fans and
frankly not good enough for anyone else. Armand's meat market consists
of a procession of turkeys.
