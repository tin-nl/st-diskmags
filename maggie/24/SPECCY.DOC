 BEAM SOFTWARE/MELBOURNE HOUSE

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Beam are one of these enlightened lot that not only permit free 
distribution of their old stuff, they've put it on their own web site
for you to grab! So without further ado, you should toddle off to the
Beam Software Homepage. Grab Penetrator first, it was one of the first 
and still one of the best Scramble clones.

Note that not all Melbourne House games are Beam's copyright, because
they sold the Melbourne House label; however, they do have a list of 
the Beam-owned games on the site.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 JOHN F. CAIN
€
----------------------------------------------------------------------

No direct proof available. However, the May/June 1995 price list from 
B.G. Services lists the following:

Mind Games Z80 emulator versions of Booty, Chaos, Nebula, Lasersquad,
Rebelstar,and Rebelstar II. Al by permission of the authors with5.00

As Booty was written by John F. Cain, I presume he allows distribution 
of all of his titles, which are:

Booty
Exodus
Pulsoid

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 DESIGN-DESIGN

----------------------------------------------------------------------

No proof available apart from the fact that a collection of their games
can be had from ftp.nvg.unit.no, and the maintainer of the Spectrum 
area at NVG (until late 1994) only put up stuff that had been released
by the authors.

Design-Design titles are:

2112 AD
Dark Star
Halls Of The Things
Halls Of The Things '85
Invasion Of The Body Snatchers
Kat Trap
On The Run
Rommel's Revenge

€----------------------------------------------------------------------
 DIGITAL INTEGRATION

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In late 1996 I emailed D.I.'s webmaster, 'Raz' about distribution 
permission for the old D.I. Speccy games, but the result has not been
perfect. He passed on the request into the depths of the company but
no response came back. When I asked once again about it, he replied 
with the following:

From: "Raz" 

Organization: Digital Integration

To: Damien Burke

Subject: Re: Old DI software on Sinclair Spectrum


Still heard nothing, hmm?  They must not be all *that* concerned 
about it then.  Tell you what, go ahead anyway,  It's only really 
tech support and the programmers that use the net from here anyway, 
but if anyone questions you about it, refer them to me.


Obviously this is not the clear permission we need, but it's better 
than nothing I suppose. D.I.'s titles on the Speccy were 
(off the top of my head):

Fighter Pilot
Night Gunner
Tomahawk
Tomahawk 128
TT Racer
€Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF)
F-16 Combat Pilot.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 GARGOYLE GAMES/FASTER THAN LIGHT

----------------------------------------------------------------------

From the Spectrum FAQ:

     Roy Carter is a registered user of Z80 and has given spoken
     permission to distribute the Gargoyle games.


No other proof available. Presumably Brian Gaff of B.G. Services is the
one to contact if you want written proof from Roy. 

Gargoyle titles are:

Ad Astra
Dun Darach
Heavy On The Magick
Marsport
Sweevo's World
Sweevo's Whirled (expanded 128K version of Sweevo's World)
Tir Na Nog

Faster Than Light titles are:

Lightforce
Shockway Rider
Hydrofool

 JULIAN GOLLOP

----------------------------------------------------------------------
€
From a text file written by Ian Coates giving instructions for Laser
Squad:

     COPYRIGHT

Julian Gollop has kindly agreed to this game being made Public Domain.
Anyoneis freely allowed to duplicate and distribute this game for use
in Spectrumemulators. It is requested that the identification of 
Julian Gollop as theauthor of this software is not removed and the 
code not altered. E-mail me

(OKTUP@MONO.CITY.AC.UK) for further details.

If you take a look at the entry for John F. Cain you will see that 
also listed in the collection of 'Mind Games' for sale are Julian's 
other titles,so he has presumably allowed distribution of all of them.

Julian's titles are:

Nebula
Rebelstar Raiders
Chaos - The Battle Of Wizards
Rebelstar
Rebelstar II
Laser Squad
Lords of Chaos

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 GREMLIN GRAPHICS

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alchemist Research, the Speccy tape magazine, have secured the 
distribution rights for Gremlin Graphics titles:

... recently, I have been contacting software houses for permission to
€distribute their old games. As a result, Alchemist Research holds
distributing rights to GREMLIN GRAPHICS GAMES, to name but one.

There are two sides to it though. Even though the law infuriates me,
that youcan blatantly advertise and distribute stuff which was 
originally written forUS! But then again, I worked hard to get the
rights to some games, and itupsets me to see them being passed 
around willy nilly! So, if you have anyGremlin Software, I expect 
you all to destroy it and get it OFFICIALLY fromme for free (!)

Andy Davis, Alchemist Research

you cancontact Andy Davis at:

Or by E-Mail at:  101543.3611@compuserve.com

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 MARK INCLEY

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mark has a web site, where he's released some of his old games for 
free distribution. So I need say no more here, just go to his site!

Oh, I should say more, like what games are we talking about? Okay:
Mayhem, Oink!, Infection (never published) and Klax.

 GIL JAYSMITH

Here's Gil's response to my request on distribution of his Repton 1 
€and 2:

Aw, hell, I don't care... it's not like I made any money from it in 
thefirst place (thanks to Superior sitting on it for two years, 
brilliantlyallowing the market to move forward...). Superior owns 
the rights to thename, obviously, and possibly to the game as well, 
but I ain't even surethey're still trading. In any case I have no 
problem granting moral rights,whether or not they're mine...


>   Well, maybe not in actual lights ;)



On the other hand, I'll only allow it if someone proves to me that 
they cansnapshot it and make it work on at least one emulator...
Don't want my nameassociated with nonworking files :)

Gil

€Since that message, working versions of each snapshot have been found;
the ones Gil had tried had been corrupted. So we at least have the 
author's permission on those, if not the actual copyright holders'.

 FERGUS McNEILL

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Chris Wild knows Fergus and contacted him about distribution of his 
games, with this result:

Date: Wed, 29 May 1996 22:03:24 +0100

From: Chris Wild 

Subject: Re: DELTA 4 - Sceptical

Damien,

Fergus has no problem with the distrubution of any DELTA4 games. 
As longas *NO* money is involved.

However he can't say anything for his ABSTRACT CONCEPTS games, 
becausethey belong to Activision. But - I don't think any 
ABSTRACT CONCEPTSgames were released on the speccy. He's a bit 
vague on this - he can'tremember much from that time!!! :)

Chris 'Hairy Dawg' Wild

And since then, Fergus has brought Delta 4 back from the dead, and 
there's now a web site up at www.delta4.demon.co.uk, which is well 
worth a visit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 MIKRO-GEN

€----------------------------------------------------------------------

No proof available apart from the fact that a collection of their games 
can be had from ftp.nvg.unit.no, and the maintainer of the Spectrum 
area at NVG (until late 1994) only put up stuff that had been released
by the authors (current practice at NVG is that only those who 
specifically deny permission have their stuff removed from the site).

 JEFF MINTER (THE YAK)

for free distribution ofany of your old games on the Sinclair 
Spectrum? Two I have are Traxx andVoidrunner. You don't have to 
releasethe copyright, just permission todistribute freely is OK; 
several otherpeople such as Amstrad, GargoyleGames, Design Design 
and Jon Ritman have all done this and are universallyadored for being
such nice chaps.

- no problem, go for it, I don't think we're selling a lot of speccy

Dear Brian,


      Thanks for sending the registered z80. I was beginning to think
      that someone somewhere had shuffled off to meet the Great
      Programmer in the sky. Everything, including the soldering,
      works OK and I now have some of my old stuff on hard disk.

      Concerning the programs I have written, I take full
     responsibility in giving you permission to use them with your
     z80 program. I have included a number of them on the disk, along
      with a comments file. Could you do me a favour and let me have a
     copy of Gregory Loses his Clock. I must have given mine away to
     someone. I am also missing an epic called "Up For Grabs" if it
     comes your way.

      I look forward to hearing from you

        Don Priestley


€The programs written by Don are:

Dictator
Gregory Loses His Clock
Jumbly
Maziacs
Meteroids
Popeye
Spawn
Tanx
Trapdoor
Trapdoor II
Up For Grabs

I received the following mail from John Hollis, one of Quiksilva's 
directors:


Date: Fri, 31 Jan 1997 08:52:28 +0000

From: John Hollis 

Organization: Hollis Research

To: speccy@jetman.demon.co.uk

Subject: Quicksilva


Hi Damien,

Great site you have there. I was a director of Quiksilva and wrote most
€of the early releases for the ZX81 and spectrum. I have no objection to
people distributing my old games but I'm not sure exactly what the
copyright position is as Quicksilva was sold and is now defunct. Still,
if it's of interest, the spectrum games I wrote were:

Space Intruders

Meteor Storm (First speech on a speccy!)

Time-Gate (First 3D star field, sold zillions of copies)

Game Designer (DIY game construction kit)

Aquaplane (Watersking with sharks)


I'm writing Windows apps at the moment but we have also been designing
games for Sega and Hasbro for the last couple of years. Our homepage 
isat www.hollis.co.uk and when I get around to updating it I'll put a
linkin to your site.

Regards


John Hollis

What a nice bloke, eh? :)

Jon Ritman is a reader of the comp.sys.sinclair newsgroup and mailed
Simon Goodwin with this:


€Date: Mon, 10 Jun 96 14:45 BST-1

From: jritman@cix.compulink.co.uk (Jon Ritman)

Subject: Re: ZX classics

The legal status of my games is as follows:

Games released by Artic Computers Ltd - Namtir Raiders, Combat Zone, 
Cosmic Debris, Bear Bovver, Dimension Destructors

All these were owned by Artic, however Artic stopped trading many years 
ago and I understand the original owner (Richard Turner) now sells 
kitchens for a living. I don't think he'll be chasing anyone for cash
but who knows.

Games released by Ocean: Match Day, Match Day II, Batman, Head over 
Heels

All of these were owned by Ocean however John Woods (one of the 
directors) has verbally given me permission to release them for free on 
the net - bear in mind that nothing is in writing and they could change 
their mind at any time - also I wonder what the status of Batman is? No 
doubt Ocean rented the name for a limited time only.

As far as I'm concerned it would be nice to think of people still 
playing the old games so no objections from me.

Hope that helps

Jon Ritman

John posted to the comp.sys.sinclair newsgroup, allowing distribution

to confirm his post, and here's the reply:

From: John Watson 

Subject: Re: copyrights, pirate software etc

Hi.

Don't know if this is what you want or not but below is a slightly
edited version of the post on Usenet. The original post was really
just to make a point about " dead programmers " and " non-existant
copyright holders ". At this late date I certainly don't expect to
make any money from the games.

Until a month or so ago, when I first got the internet connection,
I didn't even know there was such an interest in old Spectrum
games.

I haven't looked at any of the available sites as yet, so I don't
know how anyone else has phrased permissions but I think I have
covered everything I want to say. If your own site includes a freely
available archive please feel free to add the name in the bit about
€NVG and Demon.

Thanks for the post and the interest.

John.

Pro Golf & Pro Golf 2 : Atlantis publications

As the writer and copyright holder of the above two games I hereby
give permission for emulator compatable copies of said games to
be uploaded to, and downloaded from, freely available archives
such as NVG and the new Demon site.

I expressly DENY permission for these same files to be included
on any media to be sold for profit without written permission
from myself and/or Atlantis software (If they still exist).
