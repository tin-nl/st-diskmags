[Any Colour You Like]
ÅTECH VIEW:Ä Shadows go from strength to strength... just a shame 
they've split up when they were on the verge of creating something 
ÑreallyÄ outstanding. The graphic design and music are excellent; it 
appears to take inspiration from some PC demos doing the rounds at the 
moment.
The main problem is that the Falcon really wasn't designed to do a 
demo like this well: the table effects and overlaid graphics require 
both a large amount of pre-processing and memory movement. So what I 
think spoils this demo slightly are the pauses between effects while 
the next part is loaded and unpacked. Some way of combining effects in 
memory, loading during effects or better underlying code design would 
have helped. But this is a fairly minor niggle; overall one of the 
best Falcon demos in recent times [tat]



[MJJ Prod demo]
ÅTECH VIEW:Ä Eurk, what hideous design. The high point in this demo 
is... um... well I suppose it's the 3d bump mapping. We think it's 
bump mapping where all the points are calculated and drawn into a 
buffer, like a normal 2D bump map effect, then texture mapped onto the 
cube, but it looks quite nice. Also of note is the blobs effect, all 
about which you can read in this issue's Programming section. However, 
although the code is pretty nice, the demo is so badly designed I have 
trashcanned it already. Doh. [tat]


4k demos:

[Blue]Å
TECH VIEW:Ä A nice little demo this, not as brainblasting as the DHS 
one but neatly designed nonetheless. The graphics corrupted when 
running from medium resolution on my machine, but the motion blur 
routine is especially neat for the use of a good colour table. The 
"tunnel" effect is in fact a revamped feedback effect, done by drawing 
two pillars at the side of the screen and the landscape floor, then 
using the feedback to "scroll" the effect outwards. It will be 
interesting to see what they come up with next [tat]

[4ever/DHS]Å
TECH VIEW:Ä Yay! This more like it! DHS come up trumps with a 4K intro 
that shows really good design in its underlying code. The decision to 
use the FPU may annoy some quarters, but it's a revelation in the 4K 
department where difficult calculations can be reduced to just a 
couple of bytes to precalc all those nasty bits. It also allows a nice 
smooth and precise rotation since the FPU includes sine tables.
  In fact there are only a few relatively simple routines used in this 
demo: for example there's a "circle" drawer, a rotater, a tunnel 
calculator, a bump mapper, a blur effect. Each of these need only 
occupy a couple of hundred bytes. But the trick is to be able to 
combine these effects to create new ones (e.g. to pipe the output from 
the bump mapper into the tunnel effect) and DHS do it brilliantly.

Time to dig my FPU docs out... [tat]
