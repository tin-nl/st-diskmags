                         ANY COLOUR YOU LIKE

                               Shadows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ä
Its about time we made up a NME  style term for the new wave of Polish
demo crews.  How  about  Rock'n'Pole?  Whatever,  Poland  seems  to be
bursting with talent and ideas at the moment.

The flagbearers of this scene  are  the  Shadows who have been perhaps
the most prolific Falcon crew over the last 18 months of so. When they
burst onto the scene with "Firestarter" it  was obvious they had a lot
of potential. They consolidated their position with the excellent "It"
demo,  which  was  unfortunate  to  face  such  stiff  competition  at
Siliconvention. But with "Any  Colour  You  Like"  they finally walked
away with the top prize at the Orneta party.

For a crew so  young  as  Shadows,  ACYL  is an ambitious effort. Like
Sonolumineszenz and Escape's "Sili-Con-Carne"  it  approaches the demo
format in a different way from the rest. ACYL concentrates more on the
actual visual appearance of effects rather than their technical merit.
This is not a demo designed  for  clock cycle counting coders, this is
demo for everyone. A demo for  the  people. Like "Lost Blubb", this is
demo which can be shown  to  non  computer people, people who wouldn't
know a bump map from a plump  cat.  Its  more  in the style of a music
video.

Although the shadows  promise  you  "Any  Colour  You  Like", the demo
begins with lots  of  rather  dark,  drab  colours which unfortunately
don't show up too well on my trusty Atari SC1224 monitor.

Some text announcing "Shadows" then  "Any  Colour You Like" blasts its
way onto the screen with a pleasant swirling background.

We then have the credits displayed over some excellent smokey plasma.

The first "proper" effect now appears.  Anyone  who has seen "It" will
know that the Shadows are great fans  of bump-mapping, and here we see
that well loved effect again.  This  time  their  is a cluster of bobs
flying over the lit area  creating  all  sorts of pretty patterns. The
bobs look more like  glass  beads  and  the  overall  effect is rather
magical.

We now don our miners hats  for another tunnel expedition. This tunnel
is rather lively  it  scrolls  about  the  screen  and  goes through a
succession of atmospheric colour palettes. There  is even a big design
style strip of splattered colour overlayed over the tunnel.

The next effect is certainly very  original. In the background we have
a monochrome scanned picture of a motorway ( obviously considered very
scenic and beautiful in Poland ). A succession of irregular blob shape
appear over this and are then sucked into infinity. Very intriguing.

Imagine watching your favourite tunnel  effect when you are completely
pissed. The next screen tries to emulate that effect with two circular
tunnel thing being overlayed over  each  other and bouncing around the
screen. Or maybe I just have a severe case of double vision.

There is now a more  straightforward  tunnel effect. Unlike the others
it doesn't leap around  the  screen  like  a  demented  raver. It just
smoothly take down the hole to infinity. Like Sono, the colours of the
tunnel change as you move  down  it,  but  the palettes chosen are all
very dark and moody.


The next effect is... well on my  helpful  set of notes that I have in
front of me I have just written "bump map". I can't remember what this
is I'll have to have another look at the demo...
...oh dear! I've just seen it again  and  I'm none the wiser. Its some
sort of grey bump mapped  fadey  thing.  Will that do? (You're sacked!
Ed). Looking more closely I see  it  some  sort of motorway type scene
which seems to be bump mapped.  A  very  nice effect which they should
have concentrated more on.

A strange sense of deja  vu  creeps  across  you  as  you see the next
effect. Yes, it's  another  tunnel  effect.  This  time,  however, the
colours are much brighter,  quite  garish  actually.  The tunnel edges
distort into a star type shape and back again.

Next we have a plasma type  effect  with  two circly type things that
seem to attract then repel each other. Again this is nicely done.

Describing this demo becomes increasingly  difficult. If anyone hasn't
yet said that writing about  demos  is like dancing about architecture
may I be the first to do it.

OK, we have what appears  to  be  some  sort of tunnelly type rotzoomy
thing with a nice bright star shapped  white light in the centre which
zooms up to cover most of the screen then zooms out again.

Sorry for the shit description,  but  this  is  actually a really nice
looking effect, one of my favourite on the demo.

Its time for the 3D world!  Well  its  more a collection of 3D objects
than a world per se,  but  its  one  of  the  few examples of multiple
texture mapped objects on the  falcon. Unfortunately the 'plot' behind
the world is quite poor. An object flies through a torus, flies around
a cube and then decides to go through it ( a good time to show off the
z buffering ). We've had  some  quite  interesting 3D worlds in Falcon
demos (  my  favourite  being  the  robot  shoot  out  in  the Digital
Chaos/Avena Fried Bits 3  demo  )  but  this  isn't very exciting. The
textures themselves are drab shades of brown. Speedwise, when compared
against the likes of Avena and  EKO  it  is  a little slow. To do this
sort of effect impressively now you really have to hammer the DSP.

We then get a very straaaange picture  to  wrap the demo. A very oldly
drawn person and a duck  stare  out  into  the  camera. Like Niko, the
artist certainly has a unique style and it surely won't be long before
everyone starts imitating him. They will probably have to take lots of
scary drugs before they can come up with something this weird though.

And then "Any Colour You Like" ends.

At this point I must mention the  music which is absolutely superb. It
is a very atmospheric track,  bordering  on  the  ambient at times and
then some very large beats kick  in  jolting your senses. It fits very
well with the whole style of the demo.

It would have been nice if the  effects were linked in with the timing
of the music. The effects  all  seem  quite  disparate - one screen is
loaded, we see it, the screen goes black for a bit and the next effect
appears. There is no presentation between effects.

With ACYL, The Shadows  have  adopted  a  punk  attitude. They are not
afraid to do what they want how they want - they are not just going to
act like sheep and ape effects  in  other demos. This is a commendable
attitude, and it is great to see them  trying to bring new ideas and a
new direction to the falcon demo scene.


If The Shadows want to become  the  number  1  demo crew on the Falcon
they will have to  pay  a  little  more  attention  to  details such a
presentation and music timing. Some of  the  effects are also a little
polite when they should be more in your face.

But overall  this  a  brave  and  fascinating  demo  with  a brilliant
soundtrack. Any Colour You Like? Oh go on, I'll have Grey!

TECH VIEW: Shadows go from strength to strength... just a shame 
they've split up when they were on the verge of creating something 
really outstanding. The graphic design and music are excellent; it 
appears to take inspiration from some PC demos doing the rounds at the 
moment.

The main problem is that the Falcon really wasn't designed to do a 
demo like this well: the table effects and overlaid graphics require 
both a large amount of pre-processing and memory movement. So what I 
think spoils this demo slightly are the pauses between effects while 
the next part is loaded and unpacked. Some way of combining effects in 
memory, loading during effects or better underlying code design would 
have helped. But this is a fairly minor niggle; overall one of the 
best Falcon demos in recent times [tat]
