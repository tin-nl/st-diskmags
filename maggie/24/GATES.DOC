The Gates / Satan conspiracy theory:‚ The definitive list
„by TaFf (Additional material taken from UG Encounters)
€
For the last few years as Micro$oft has grown poor old Bill has 
had to put up with quite a lot as theories about links between 
the evil one and himself sprang up. Everyone knows about the 666 
theory (included below), however more obscure links. So here 
finally is the definitive list.

1. Take the name Bill Gates III, convert into ASCII, add these 
numbers up, 666 is the total 
   ie.                       Bill Gates III
                     66+73+76+76+71+65+84+69+83+3   =  666
                     
2. Although there are 22 buildings at the Micro$oft headquarters 
there is allegedly a 23rd pentagonal building (building 7). It 
has been suggested that this building is a communications 
portal to some cosmic being with designs on world domination.
   
3. It has been said that Gates choose computers because code and 
symbolism has long been used by organisations such as the 
Illuminati (a group who's military monastic order 'The Knights 
Templar'allegedly worship a devil idol called Baphomet. 
Baphomet could only answer question with yes or no, 1 or 0. 
Could this have been an early form of Binary Code).
  
We will report more on these as information arrives ( If I can be 
bothered).
