Blue Monkey's.......

        < h a r d c o r e >   P h o n e y   P h o n e - I n s

        "Catch my guts up, smack my nuts up.  Boyaka boo, it is I, who
is Blue.  Yes, Monkey mates everywhere,  I'm back once again, it's the
Renegade Munkster, with more swanky,  pranky, phoney wind-ups than you
can shake a light sabre at.
        Oooh, ahooga-oooga, wooo - Am I spillin' the beans, like Billy
Jean, all mean and lean, like a  sex  machine, a-ha.  But I believe in
miracles and cars and stars and  space  in  your face and if you could
walk in the sky, you would be very high, yeah?"

        "If you hain't worked it  out  yet,  you  must  be living in a
Hutt, living in a cardboard Hutt,  afraid  of your Tetnus Jabbs like a
scaredy crab, stuck in a pit  with  a  nasty monster whos arms are too
long for its face.  Get off my  case,  Ace,  you were never as good as
Bonnie Langford in Dr. Who, anyway.  Nice One."

        "R you able 2 understand D words, 2?  Or do you need help from
some guy with a beard?   Let  me  spell  it  out  for ya, like a crazy
French teacher, with her verbs  and  her  words  all disturbed, like a
bird, on the curb of her inner-self shoe shop, Startright?
        "This time round I've  done  the  'phoning,  phoney like, to a
silly nilly acting school, who think they're cool, with rubber luvvies
all tubby, but not on  the  telley  like a chicken suited TV-for-a-gut
git, boyo.
        "Boyo?  Boyo?  Boy that  showed  'em  when  I sneaked into The
Suffolk Academy of Dance and Performing Arts, putting on my journalist
trousers to let me examine their  acting  books  of wisdom.  So it may
not be funny  to  ring  up  poor,  unsuspecting  acting  hopefuls, but
telling them that they can  sell  their  souls  for  gold at a casting
session looking for new recruits  for  the spanking Star Wars Trilogy,
is.  Funny, right?"

        "So there I was, talking to strangers like a child that didn't
care and promising the stupid thespians  that if they stretched up and
took a Star, then Phwoooar, they could be famous.
        "But when, oh when, will they be  famous?  I can answer, I can
answer that, with no stinking picture in the papers for people to lure
at me mug, 'cos I do the 'phoning, all the time, on the telephone line
and here's what happened, Boba.  Fett?  Fett?  Fett off.  Sorted."


The Suffolk Academy of Dance and Performing Arts, Ipswich:
Clarissa Jordan, 21, at home.

 [phone rings, gets picked up]
Woman   : Hello?
Blue    : Ms. Jordan?
Woman   : Mrs.
Blue    : Pardon?
Woman   : [pauses] Who is it you wanted?
€Blue    : Well I was hoping for a Ms. Clarissa Jordan.  I haven't gone
          and gotten my numbers in a state, have I?
Woman   : No, Clarry's in the other room, I'll just get her.  Who is
          it?
Blue    : Oh, this is Joe Bullshettie.
Woman   : Who?
Blue    : Joe Bullshettie.  I'm a casting agent.  I need to just clear
          some things up with Clarissa.
Woman   : Oh!
Blue    : Your daughter I presume?
Woman   : Yes, one moment please.
  [pause, talking heard from other room, two sharp hand claps and a
   light squeel is heard.  hurried footsteps, then a light voice
   saying: "Shut the door."]
Clarry  : [excitedly:] Hello!
Blue    : Hi. [pauses]  Who is this I'm speaking to?
Clarry  : I'm Clarissa Jordan - the Ms. Clarissa Jordan you asked to
          speak to.
Blue    : Well, I did get that right didn't I?  I was hoping to cast a
          female in the role afterall.
Clarry  : Oh yes, there is no doubt about that, I am very female
          indeed.
Blue    : Well that's a start at least, Clarissa, or what was it your
          mother refered to you as?
Clarry  : I have no idea - probably something un-repeatable, I expect!
Blue    : No, it was something along the lines of Carrey, or Clarry.
Clarry  : Oh yes, Clarry - that's what my family and friends call me..
          so you.. can call me Clarry if you like.
 [pauses, how can I possibly wind up such a lovely sounding femme?]
Blue    : [desperately trying not to surrender and resort to chat-up
          mode] Okay Clarry, I had better introduce myself before we
          get any further.  I'm Jod.. no I'm not.. I'm [pauses] I'm
          Joe Bullshettie from LucasFilm..
Clarry  : [cuts me off] Is this about Ruth Rendel?  Sorry.
Blue    : Ruth Rendel?  No.  What is this about Ruth Rendel?
Clarry  : Oh, nothing.  Really.
Blue    : [silence]
Clarry  : [laughs] You're not going to let me get away with this, are
          you?  I auditioned at casting sessions for a Ruth Rendel
          mystery the other week and thought that you were bringing me
          news of, well, the result more than anything.  You're not,
          then?
Blue    : No, I, I knew nothing of this Ruth Rendel situation, I am
          'phoning you to follow up the letter you recieved a few days
          ago, concerning your casting sessions at LucasFilm.
Clarry  : LucasFilm?  Do you make the Ruth Rendels?
Blue    : Are you not aware of LucasFilm?
Clarry  : No, I'm sorry, hands up, I know nothing of a casting session
          with your people.
Blue    : Did you not receive our letter?
Clarry  : Oh, well, [sounding flustered] excuse me [covers mouthpiece,
          muffled voices heard before 'secrecy' button is pressed on
          her side of the line]  Hello?
Blue    : Is there some confusion?
€Clarry  : I'm afraid I have no record of recieving a letter from any
          other casting agency than the one I've already spoke of.
Blue    : This could be problematic.
Clarry  : You did say Lucas, didn't you?
Blue    : LucasFilm, that is correct.
Clarry  : Are you the same people that made the Star Wars films?
Blue    : Well, that's what this is concerning.
Clarry  : Aha?
Blue    : The new Star Wars trilogy is set to start filming in one
          month's time, mid September, and we are an actress down.
          We are looking for a twenty-something girl to fill the boots
          of female space rogue, Nicolette, annnd you were chosen for
          casting.
Clarry  : Aaah!  You want me for a film!  A real feature film!  I'm
          gonna be in Star Wars!
 [whooping heard from background, have I gone too far this time?]
Blue    : Not yet you're not - we've got some casting to do first.
Clarry  : Okay, when are the sessions?  I'm enthusiastic and very
          good.
Blue    : The casting sessions are now.
Clarry  : Where at?
Blue    : Had you recieved my letter you would have realised that
          schedules are running so short of late, that a formal
          casting session is out of the question.  We're doing all
          casting down the 'phone.
Clarry  : Down the 'phone?
Blue    : Yes, that's right.  Have you got your script there?
Clarry  : My script?
Blue    : Oh, of course, you didn't recieve my letter, did you?  So
          you won't have a script, will you?
Clarry  : No, I'm sorry, I'm very, very sorry, could you post another
          one.  I'm worth it - I've done a lot of theatre work and was
          with the Angles Tour Group at Easter.
Blue    : Hmmm. [pauses]
Clarry  : Or could you read some of the script off for me and I'll
          write it down.  I have this brilliant system for memorising
          lines - It's like total recall, almost.  Well, [giggles] not
          quite.
Blue    : Clarry, how are you at ad-libbing?
Clarry  : I've done that a lot.  Part of a theatre production I was
          involved in saw a group of us acting to the audience's
          suggested motivations, a la Whoose Line Is It Anyway, though
          that's not really very funny anymore.
Blue    : Right, that's what we shall do, then.  But it mustn't be
          funny.  Only very serious, okay?
Clarry  : Oh, of course.  Who did you say I was playing?
Blue    : Nicolette.
Clarry  : Sounds like something you freshen your breath with!  Sorry.
Blue    : Nicolette is a cargo smuggling space rogue who could snap
          your neck with the flick of a wrist, so scoff you shall not.
Clarry  : Sorry, again. [a few muffled noises, her end]
Blue    : What's going on, are you ready?
Clarry  : I am sorry - people are crowding around the doorway,
          wondering what's going on.  I've shooed them away now and
€          I'm sorry for messing you about so much, but please go on.
Blue    : You are very apoligetic, aren't you?
Clarry  : I'm just polite, that's all.
Blue    : I hope you're not the submissive type: Nicolette's a very
          agressive, dominating character and kicks the arse of all
          in her way.
Clarry  : [speaks, laughing] Okay.
Blue    : It's not funny.  I want to hear that agression in you.  Come
          on, scream.
Clarry  : You want me to scream?
Blue    : Look, imagine this is a live casting session, I am just one
          of many members sitting here watching you perform in this
          grand old hall, while you stand at the front, giving this
          - your big break - all you have in you.  So go ahead and do
          it.
Clarry  : Allllright then.
Blue    : Scream.
Clarry  : [total girlie in danger scream] Aiiieeeeeeeee!  [starts
          laughing]
Blue    : No, no, no.  Not a pathetic scream:  A war-cry.  I want to
          hear the adrenalin curdling up inside of you, I want to feel
          my bones shake with fear as you belch out your deepest
          grunt.  I want it to be agressive, I want it to be
          frightening, I want it to be loosely sexual with it - for
          when we give the film a video release, you know - but most
          of all, I want it to be [pauses while I purposefully take a
          breath in through my nose and release with emphasis on final
          word] cinematic.
Clarry  : [slow breath in] HER-AGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Blue    : [laughing and clapping with 'phone pressed between chin and
          shoulder, 'phone falls into lap, I pick it up]  Excellent!
Clarry  : [laughing] Yeah, and now my family think I'm insane.
Blue    : Let them.  Soon you'll be living in a huge house far away
          from wanting to embarass yourself by admitting you know
          them, anyway.
Clarry  : Okay, what's next.
Blue    : Next we have the scene where you meet the young Ben Kenobi
          for the first time and scoff at his belief in the force.
          We're going to do this scene in the form of an argument as
          you don't have a script, just so that I can get a flavour of
          your ability to jump into character.  You are to be your
          usual, agressive, head-cracking self, while I play Ben
          Kenobi by warbling away in that voice of his.  Okay then,
          the scene itself is taking place in a space port, I might
          have already said, and the action all starts up when I
          insult your R2 unit.  Is that all clear?
Clarry  : Definitely.  What direction has this got to go in?
Blue    : And... How do you mean?
Clarry  : I wondered if we were working towards a key ellement?  Do
          we fight, or does something elese happen?
Blue    : In the screen version, a giant slug will intervene and
          slime you up good and proper, but we don't need to worry
          about that yet.
Clarry  : Alright.
€Blue    : Though I could say where abouts the slug comes in and you
          can start screaming again if you like.
Clarry  : Yes, I'll do that.  And you'll tell me, will you?
Blue    : Oh yes.
Clarry  : Good.
Blue    : [pauses] Alright then, are we ready to start the scene?
Clarry  : Yes I am.
Blue    : Okay. [clears throat] Act One, Scene Five: The Space Port.
          [warbling:] Your R2 droid, is it for sale?
Clarry  : [pauses] Is it?
Blue    : No, it's not.
Clarry  : Thanks. [bellows:]  What's it to you, old man?
Blue    : [warbling:] Oh, I merely thought that such a device would
          surely be for sale, possibly as scrap.
Clarry  : Well, this 'device' as you call it just so happens to be
          my one and only partner in this galaxy.  Humans cheat and
          let you down too often for my kind of work, while droids
          never attempt to stab you in the back when you're not
          looking, selling your soul for a tank full of gasoline.
Blue    : [normal voice:]  Good, though space cruisers do not run on
          gasoline and um, all this talk of mechanical devices: Sounds
          too sexual.  We want a bit of that - you know, for the video
          release - but too much and it simply wouldn't be classed as
          a family film.
Clarry  : Okay.
Blue    : Got all that?
Clarry  : Yes.
Blue    : Now where were we?
Clarry  : I was just saying that robots were more reliable than humans
          - if I'm a tough, rugged character, this would reveal how I
          find it hard to relate to people.  That's probably why I'm
          so hostile to everyone.  As you said I was.
Blue    : Good, very good.  I like you, Clarissa.
Clarry  : I'm eager to go again, now.
Blue    : I wish they all said that.  Anyway, back in the space port.
          [clears throat, warbling voice:]  Humans... No.  [clears
          throat again]  Do I look so old to young eyes?  So weak and
          fragile, do I?  You must think again, my little feisty one.
Clarry  : [shouts:]  I will think of what I like.  And who are you to
          make asumptions that I even wish to speak to you, anyway?
          Get out of my way before fate takes another victim.
Blue    : So strong are you, though you need a tiny metal hunk on
          wheels as a chaparone from port to port.
Clarry  : Let the droid be and leave us be. [normal voice:]  Sorry,
          that wasn't very good.
Blue    : Okay, I understand, you lost it a bit.  That is fine though,
          you're doing great.
Clarry  : Thank you.
Blue    : It's time to introduce a new ellement though.  Alright then,
          in the film itself - let me just explain something - when,
          or I should actually say 'if' you get picked to play
          Nicolette, then the stuff you shall be doing on camera will
          be drasticly different to the things you have been taught to
          do on stage.
€Clarry  : I understand: Instead of playing to an audience, you play to
          a camera and therefore channel all your motivation to that
          one space.
Blue    : Um, yeah, that as well, but I was more thinking in the way
          of special effects and audiable actions.  Of course, it's
          all very well acting your little heart out, filling in all
          the gaps, but when it comes for the special effects and
          sonic guys to come in and jazz the scene up a little, it all
          looks a little crammed when you've been acting and not
          leaving any spaces.  And besides, a lot of the special
          effects people are a bit thick, under-achievers and all that
          and they get ever so confused at where to stick the effects.
          This, of course, doesn't make any difference to us, as we're
          only casting, but to get you into good practice, we're going
          to stick to screen rules.
Clarry  : Okay.
Blue    : In this scene, we eventually get into a fight - which is
          what we'll be working up to.  In the scrape, I - being a
          Jedi Knight - use a lightsabre, which sounds a bit like
          this: Brrrrwowww.  [pauses] Now, you play a fast moving
          space rogue and what do fast moving space rogues like
          yourself fight with?
Clarry  : Their fists?
Blue    : [laughs] Sounds promising, but Nicolette actually prefers to
          use a gun.  And what do lazer guns sound like?
Clarry  : They make a buzzy, zapping sound.
Blue    : Yep, that sounds like: Peeyoow!
Clarry  : [extra loud, telephone distortion] PeeYAARGH!
Blue    : Ow! [laughs] Very loud, that lazer gun of yours.
Clarry  : I know. [titters]
Blue    : Even if you don't shoot your foes, the noise'll scare most
          of them clear away.
Clarry  : [laughs].
Blue    : Okay, now that we have practiced the sounds, remember to put
          them into motion when we start scrapping, okay there?  I
          will prompt you at the appropriate time, but for now we
          shall continue where we last left off.  In the space port,
          insulting robots.  [pauses, clears throat, warbling:]
          What are you but a female space maiden, without purpose or
          friend?
Clarry  : [spitting:] What are you but dead?  [normal voice:] I'll
          draw my gun on screen.  Is that okay?
Blue    : Yeah. [warbling:] As if weapons are to be the answer to it
          all.  Brrrwow, burwow.  [normal voice:] That's my light
          sabre.
Clarry  : So, you want to play?  Ha!  Where's the sport?  Get outta
          our way.
Blue    : No!  I wish to fight!  Berrrroww!  Barrroww!
Clarry  : Perrrow!
Blue    : Barrroww!
Clarry  : PEEEYOWW!  Think you're hot, heh?
Blue    : Baaaaarow!  [normal voice, hurried:] And bang, your gun gets
          knocked out of your hands and you fall to the floor.
Clarry  : ARRgh!  You idiot!  Do you know what you've just done?
€Blue    : Enter the giant slug to slime you up!  FETCH!
Clarry  : [snarls:] Harsh I shall be, as I'm now getting up.
Blue    : What about the slug?
Clarry  : [shouts:] SLUG!
Blue    : [reassuring:] Yeah, the slug that slimes you up.  Scream
          girl, scream.
Clarry  : ArrrrrEEEEEEEII!  Oh no, oh AAAAAARGH!
Blue    : [frantic 'swallow that laugh' sniggering, followed by
          hysterical laughter]
Clarry  : [normal voice, somewhat distant:] How was that?
Blue    : [still laughing] Oh, I'm sorry, I am really, really sorry,
          I feel like such a total and utter bastard, you know that.
Clarry  : [silence]
Blue    : Um, how can I put this?  This has been.. a terrific, evil,
          God given piss-take of a wind-up to your misfortune and I
          just feel soooo bad about it, girl.
Clarry  : You mean this isn't serious?
Blue    : No, this is a total wind-up.  [laughs:] None of it's true.
          I am just so sorry.
Clarry  : You bastard.  Who the hell are you?
Blue    : Now, that would be telling, but someone very close was
          probably behind it all and I'm just gonna leave you with the
          rest of your life to try and work it out.
Clarry  : No, tell me.  Even if you hang up, you're still trace-able,
          I can press 1471.
Blue    : Oh, God girl, I've got that covered - I'm not that stupid.
          Aren't you pissed?
Clarry  : No.  I think it's quite funny.
Blue    : Oh God, you're so lovely - You're not even angry at me.
          Usually it's a straight slam down of the bloody 'phone.
Clarry  : Do you do this a lot?  You're very serious.  Sounding, I
          mean.
Blue    : It is an occassional pastime.
Clarry  : [aside:] God.
Blue    : [pause] But I am sorry.  Seriously.  And I hope I didn't get
          you're hopes up too much, talking of films and all that.
Clarry  : Well you did a bit, but that's all over with now.
Blue    : And you've got your Ruth Rendel's to look forward to.
Clarry  : IF, I get cast.
Blue    : Oh, you will, I'm sure, you're good.  You're the only girl I
          know who I can make scream just by asking her.
Clarry  : [laughs] God, everyone'll think I'm mad.
Blue    : But I'm glad you took it well and am surprised you didn't
          suspect, you drama hopeful, you.
Clarry  : Well, I did suspect, actually, it's just that things have
          been so prospectful lately, that I believed every word you
          said.  Even the silly sounds bit.
Blue    : [laughs]  That is good then.  I will see you... never... and
          wish you all the luck, you gorgeous femme, you.
Clarry  : Don't go - you've got to at least give us a clue as to who
          set you up to do this.  You couldn't have rung here knowing
          my name and that I'm an actress without a lead.
Blue    : Damn right I couldn't, but I'm cunning like that.  Bye.
