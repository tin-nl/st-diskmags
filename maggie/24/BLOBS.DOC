                              "THE BLOB"
                          €Steven Tattersall



One of the newer-style demo effects is that of "blobs", where there 
are two or more amorphous shaped objects which distort when they come 
into proximity with one another (see the ST intro for this edition of 
Maggie for instance). More advanced demos, especially on the PC, have 
this effect in 3 dimensions, but here we'll concern ourselves with the 
"simple" 2D version.





                          PRINCIPLE OF BLOBS€

The idea behind blobs is not a new one, but is quite tricky to 
visualise at first. The best analogy is that of clouds. Clouds are in 
essence just like blobs - they are made up of water vapour, and when 
the amount of water vapour in our cloud reaches a certain level, it 
becomes visible to us. Below this level there is still a certain level 
of water vapour, but we cannot see it.

Now imagine that another cloud comes along and merges with our first 
cloud. Both have their own levels of water vapour at given points. Now 
it is possible that there are areas in these two clouds where two 
water levels that were previously invisible now overlap. The water 
levels combine to give a new level which now becomes invisble. As the 
two clouds pass through one another we see a continuously-changing 
pattern.

Exactly the same principle is used in the code to produce blobs. At 
any given point we simply sum the "densities" of all the elements in 
our system and plot the outcome.





                            DEFINING BLOBS€

We can define the blob by means of a "density function". When we 
define the blob at point (x,y) - where (x=0,y=0) is the centre of the 
blob - we can use a formula to define the density at that point.

The density value is each case will range from 0 to 1. A value of 0 
means that at this point there will be no effect from the blob. A 
value of 1 is the maximum density allowed: when summing our densities, 
any resultant value above 1 will simply be treated as 1.


For the sake of simplicity and prettiness, we will only model our 
process around circular blobs. First we choose a value ˆmax_r€ for the 
maximum radius of the blob. This is the distance from the centre 
further than which the blob will have no effect at all.

Now we can apply our algorithm to determine the density at each point 
of our blob. In simple pseudocode, this is:

„        !------------------------------------------------------------
        ! x and y are the co-ordinate values given as input

        LET distance = sqr ( x*x + y*y) !Calc distance from centre
        IF distance > max_r THEN
          LET density = 0               !Outside max_r, density=0
        ELSE
          LET fraction = (distance/max_r)
                                        !Convert distance to the
                                        !range 0 to 1
          LET density = (1-fraction^2) ^ 4
                                        !calculate density function
        ENDIF
        !------------------------------------------------------------
                                Fig 1. Simple density function€


The line "LET density = (1-fraction^2) ^ 4" is the interesting one.

Firstly, it takes the value ˆfraction€ and firstly converts it to a 
value equal to 1 at the very centre of the blob and 0 at the edge of 
ˆmax_r€, but the function tails off increasingly quickly as we reach the 
outer reaches of the blob.

Secondly, the second part of this assignment statement accentuates the 
tail-off of density as we reach the outside even more. This is to give 
a smoother effect when two or more blobs combine.

Some of you might wonder why the power used here is "^4" rather than 
"^2" This is because we are working in two dimensions rather than 
three. Without going into the maths too deeply, our model here is a 
two-dimensional cross-section of a 3D model, so repeating the squaring 
of our density function is a simple way of reducing the calculations 
to 2 dimensions.




                             USING BLOBS€

The supplied code for this algorithm is written in GFA basic 
(BLOB1.LST). It is a simple example which uses the above code as a 
function - FN blob(x%,y%) - to convert orthogonal x and y into a 
density for two blobs at each point on the screen. It then sums these 
densities, caps them so the sum is less than one and plots a colour 
for the corresponding value.





                         FASTER BLOB, FASTER€

There are several ways of optimizing this function for use in assembly 
or some other lower level language. Our function above uses the "sqr" 
square root function to calculate the distance from the centre of the 
blob. By replacing "ˆdistance€" with a new variable "ˆdistance_squared€" 
we produce a revised function:

„        !------------------------------------------------------------
        ! x and y are the co-ordinate values given as input
        LET distance_squared = x*x + y*y
        IF distance_squared > max_r*max_r THEN
          LET density = 0               !Outside max_r, density=0
        ELSE
          LET fraction_squared = (distance_squared/max_r/max_r)
          LET density = (1-fraction_squared) ^ 4
                                        !calculate density function
        ENDIF
        !------------------------------------------------------------
                                Fig 2. Revised density function.€

This is also available in "BLOB2" to show that it gives the same 
result.

Note the use of "fraction_squared" as a result of the substitutions.
This is because

        fraction = distance
                   --------
                    max_r

but:    distance_squared = distance.distance = distance   distance
        ----------------   -----------------   -------- . --------
          max_r . max_r       max_r.max_r        max_r      max_r

(Basic GCSE Maths, apparently)

 - which is equal to "fraction" squared.







                          BLOBS IN ASSEMBLER€

Now the function is more or less ready to be converted into assembler, 
since the function nearly now only uses integers. We need to now 
change the range of "fraction" and "fraction_squared" to get something 
really useable.

Here are the original lines we need to change:

„          LET fraction_squared = (distance_squared/max_r/max_r)
          LET density = (1-fraction_squared) ^ 4€

ˆfraction_squared€ still ranges from 0 to 1. If we make it range from, 
say 0 to 255 by multiplying ˆdistance_squared€ by 256 before we start - 
not unreasonable for assembler - the result in "ˆdensity€" will range 
from 0 to 256^4-1 (ie a long word value in assembler)

„          LET fraction_squared = 256*distance_squared/max_r/max_r)
          LET density = (1-fraction_squared)^4€

We now have the whole function in a format useable in assembler:

„        !------------------------------------------------------------
        ! x and y are the co-ordinate values given as input
        LET distance_squared = x*x + y*y
        IF distance_squared > max_r*max_r THEN
          LET density = 0               !Outside max_r, density=0
        ELSE
          LET fraction_squared = 256*distance_squared/max_r/max_r)
          LET density = (1-fraction_squared)^4
                                        !calculate density function
        ENDIF
        !------------------------------------------------------------
                        Fig 3. Assembler-useable density function.€


Once this is written in assembler, we can store the blob as a table 
and simply add two or more tables together to create animated blobs. 
If I have time in the coming week there will be a small ST intro to 
this issue of Maggie which does this in realtime.
