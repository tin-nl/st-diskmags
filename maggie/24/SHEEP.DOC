Not many quadropeds have appeared in a two page spread in STF or 
have seen new software of the calibre Yak produces before it is 
even released. However Molly and Flossy, Yaks pet sheep, have 
done all this and more. 

Once again Maggie brings you an exclusive interview about life, 
love, and sheepdip.

Maggie:Å Well then guys tell us a little about your selves.Ä
 Molly: (Chews some grass uninterested)
Flossy: (Walks to the other side of the field and says nothing)

ÅMaggie: What is a normal day in the lives of herbivors such as 
your selves?
Ä Molly: Bleet!!!
Flossy: (Still at the otherside of the field)

Maggie:Å What is it like spending time with Yak?Ä
 Molly: (Chews a little more grass seductively)
Flossy: (Still over by the fence)

Maggie:Å What is your favourate Llamasoft title?Ä
 Molly: Bleet!!!
Flossy: Llamatron 
Maggie:ÖAaaaaagh a talking sheep!!!Ä

It is a this point that our interviewer passed out. Meanwhile 
Molly and Flossy discuss String theory with Yak's Llama.
