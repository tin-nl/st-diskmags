                     ÖFROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTSÅ

Å[] RETURN OF THE DRACÄ

Hold the front page - a new web  browser for the Falcon is about to be
released! Its about time that the  CAB monopoly was challenged and the
German Draconis package should  do  that.  It  includes  a web browser
("The Light Of Adamas"), its  on  TCP/IP  stack, supports PPP and even
comes with a C  library  for  programmers  wanting to develop internet
applications. The Draconis package  runs  on  all  Ataris:  ST, TT and
Falcon. It is a GEM based package,  but will run equally happily under
MagiC. The coder is  very  ambitious  -  Java  support  is promised in
future versions!


Å[] CAB IT UPÄ

Development of the Crystal Atari  Browser continues apace. Version 2.5
has just been released  and  it  now  has  its own internet connection
software. You no longer have to worry about fiddling with cryptic STiK
configuration files, CAB's new PPP  Connect  software has friendly GEM
interface which allows you to  painlessly  set  up your internet link.
And unlike STiK, the software supports PPP connection. CAB 2.5 is best
used with MagiC, but will run happily under GEM.


Å[] FOR WHOM THE SHELL TOLLSÄ

Its new shell time as  the  Falcon  Maggie interface gets an overhaul.
Things work a lot quicker now, especially on VGA monitors and there is
now support for First Word Plus files  in the text displayer. Mr. Pink
tells us "The old shell was getting quite tired and I was getting sick
of it. It was time for  a  change." ( background music, D:Ream 'Things
Can Only Get Better ). "The  whole  thing  has been 100% recoded. This
issue is just a preview, the full thing has a lot more to it. I really
wanted to get this shell out  to showcase Ripley's amazing artwork. We
have all kinds of crazy ideas for  the next issue!". So there you have
it - Mr. Pink, crazy name, crazy guy.


Å[] MAKING A MINTÄ

Jeff Minter is back  on  the  coding  trail.  He  is  working with the
developer of the Jaguar on a  new super console codenamed 'Project X'.
Details are vague  at  the  moment  but  Jeff  has  described  the new
hardware as 'Awesome' and is  quite  possibly writing a defender clone
for it.

Ä
Å[] EVERYBODY IN THE PLACEÄ

The French party 'The Place To  Be  5'  spawned a number of new Falcon
demos and intros. It saw the return of MJJ productions who scooped the
top award in the main demo competition with some nifty bump mapping.
Here are the official results.

 Place To Be 5 - Atari Results

 Intro 96 K

 1 - Gerbyrdt.prg - Bill Intro
 2 - TrioFire - Trio Intro

 Demos :

 1 - Mjj Prod
 2 - Codeporc
 3 - Trisomic

Full reviews of all  these  demos  will  appear  in  the next issue of
Maggie.


Å[] ITS GETTING NET-TER ALL THE TIMEÄ

Maggie is going to appear on  the information super highway! According
to that nice Mr Blair, its the  next  big thing! Every single issue of
Maggie will be converted to HTML  and  will  be placed on the web. All
screenshots will also be included, even  screenshots of the intros and
main menus! All the  disk  based  versions  will  be available on this
sight to download. Of course Maggie  will still be available first and
foremost in the disk-based incarnation, but by being on the web we can
let the sad pc dads see what  they are missing! The HTML conversion is
being carried out by sh3  of  Reservoir  Gods  and Evl of Dead Hackers
Society - bit respect to both off them. They know what time it is!

Å[] STUCK IN THE MIDI WITH YOUÄ

Digital Tracker author  Jaccard  Emmanuel  has  been  busy  coding new
utilities for the musically inclined. He has just released a MIDI file
player which will  play  songs  on  GM  compatible  modules.  The next
release of Digital Tracker - now  retitled  "Digital Home Studio" - is
set to be one of the most  impressive music programs on the falcon. As
well as all the conventional  tracker  features  it has facilities for
MIDI input and direct to disk recording. You can apply digital effects
to your music in real time. You can even write your music direct to CD
or DAT. As the author says  "its  a  sequencer, a D2d station, digital
effect box and a sampler!".


Å[] HOLLAND OF THE FREEÄ

Cheeky chappy and Maggie editor bloke  Chris 'CIH' Holland has finally
taken the plunge and gone on-line.  "Tony  Blair  forced me to at gun-
Äpoint" he mumbled meekly  before  spending  the  rest  of  the week on
Trevor McDonald's "Amusing Animal Stories Homepage".
You can contact CIH at maggieteam@zetnet.co.uk
Or you may find him  hanging  around  IRC heatedly discussing the size
and texture of cauliflowers with a bot.


Å[] DON'T BE SILIÄ

It appears  that  there  will  be  no  Siliconvention  next  year. The
organisers made a big loss  on  the  last  party and probably won't be
able to afford to run it again. There  is talk of it merging with a PC
party such as Symposium. This would be a real shame as PC parties suck
as they are full  of  egotistical  wankers, whereas Siliconvention was
small and friendly. The Maggie  Team are investigating the possibility
of holding an Atari party in the UK.


Å[] HOWZAT!Ä


Margarine fearing Reservoir God, SpareHead3,  is  proving to be one of
the most versatile member of the  demo fraternity. As well as painting
some of the phattest graphics on  the  falcon and knocking out some of
the largest tunes he has know  turned  his triangular hands to coding.
"Well if somebody like Mr  Pink  can  code", he laughed "anyone can!".
The man like sparehead has  already  completed  his first game, a text
based cricket simulator  called  "Just  Not  Cricket",  which is quite
ironic as that is just what it is!!!
Sparehead reveals that his main  inspiration  for coding the game came
from  enigmatic  Zimbabwe  captain,  Bertus   Erasmus.  "Bertus  is  a
spiritual figure." he whispered.  "and  this  game  is  just my way of
saying thank you." Rumours that MSG  is coding a shoot-em-up featuring
Harry Secombe could not be confirmed as Maggie went to press.


Å[] NEW BEAT MANIFESTOÄ

Willie's Adventurer coders New Beat  Devlopment are expanding into the
area of demo coding. Programming  the  brilliant  'BLUE' 4ktro for the
Orneta party has given them a  taste  a  demo-coding action - and they
want more! Not content  with  just  coding  the stunning Maggie intro,
Daniel and Thomas are working on a  full demo. Daniel has been getting
to grips with the DSP and  if  the  results are anything like Willie's
then we are in for a treat.


Å[] UNFINISHED SYMPHONYÄ

Professional  scouser,  Edward  'Eh  la!  Calm  Down!'  Cleveland  has
finished his opus "Donkey  Island"  which  should  be released any day
know. But it isn't 100% complete - not all of the puzzles are in there
and you can't actually complete  the  game.  "I'm releasing what would
have been the shareware version. If I get enough response from it I'll
finish coding the full version. But I'm  fed  up with it at the moment
and I want to code other things."
Ä

Å[] CWM TO DADDYÄ

The Reservoir Gods held another  successful  Cwmvention in the wild of
wales. Main organiser, Mr Pink, said "bloody  hell! do I have to sleep
in that barn again?" whilst PC coder Charles revealed "There were mice
crawling over my head!". Musician MSG  was perhaps the most productive
person there "I must  have  cooked  about  20  packets of noodles!" he
exclusively revealed to Maggie. Pixel-kid  sh3  was outspoken. "I live
in a sleeping  bag  and  look  like  Mother  Theresa." Official Maggie
reporter Ripley gave us all  the  juicy  gossip "MagiC is bobbins. And
MSG got impaled on some barbed  wire.  City  kids eh?". Pool Demon Tim
Dann was less active. "I haven't  done much coding recently. Just this
raytracer."  IRC  guru  Arnel,  now  officially  dubbed  'the  Michael
Schumacher of Gloucester' was full of  HTML based wisdom "Don't forget
to use the <I> tag for your  Tori  Amos lyrics!". But perhaps the most
succinct words came from  the  Waterloo  barmaid  "Is  anyone going to
Brighton next weekend?"


Å[] HACK TO THE FUTUREÄ

If you thought that DHS were  dead  (geddit???)  boy you are so wrong!
Not content with stunning the world with  "The Best 4Ktro in the World
Ever" ( (c) Maggie 1997 ) with the awesome 4ever, Evl and the lads are
back sweating over Devpac for  a  full  demo.  "It  will be FPU only!"
reveals Evl, and is  also  likely  to  include  some  ace bump mapping
effects including a 3D  version  of  the  bump  mapped tunnel. Getting
buying those FPUs!


Å[] ASCII AND YOU WILL RECEIVEÄ

The stunning ASCII Art entries from Cwmvention 97 will be available in
a revolutionary ASCII-ARTtro coded  by  Mr  Pink with atmospheric jazz
muzak provided by  MSG.  "Its  gggreeeat"  revealed  an  insider after
toking heavily on a jazz cigarette.


Å[] MOVIN' ON UPÄ

Its geographical madness! Both Ripley and  Mr Pink have fled Reservoir
Gods HQ in wales. Ripley has got a place at Cambridge studying English
(congrats from all the Maggie team!) and is following CIH on-line. You
can contact her at ripley_rg@hotmail.com or on #atari!
Mr. Pink has  finished  working  at  Powys  TEC  so  unfortunately the
Reservoir Gods mailing list has had to come  to an end. He is now back
studying in Liverpool. You can  now  find him at mrpink_rg@hotmail.com
or raving down at Voodoo.

Å[] BARNARNA-RAMAÄ

A new Swedish Falcon crew called 'skummbarnarnarnas' ( I shit you not,
atari kids! ) have been formed. They are working on a demo entitled "A
Yellow Banana" which promises to be  in  a Senior Dads stylee. Effects
Äinclude their own unique take on z  buffering and bump mapping. Have a
barnarna!


Å[] A DAY IN THE LIFEÄ

If you liked Sworm then have  you ever thought of seeking professional
help? The 24hour games from this years  Cwmvention are on the brink of
being released. "Bunion Canyon"  is  Mr  Pink's  effort, another 8 bit
conversion with multiplayer mode and  some  real retro action. "It got
everything - ", he  excitedly  babbled  to  Maggie, "jumping, running,
falling, shouting,  shagging,  crazy  monsters  &  William  Hague. Oh,
that's the Tory party conference. The  game  itself  has a top tune by
MSG." There is also a PC version, entitled 'Hammered' coded by Charles
with graphics by Ripley.


Å[] PULSE'S NOT RACINGÄ

WRC's shoot-em-up "Pulse" has  been  delayed  because  Mr. Putt's hard
drive got corrupted. So we'll have to wait a bit longer for the lentil
based action. In the mean-time he has  coded a new version of him bump
mapping routines for the WRC demo.


Å[] MEGAMAN RAID ON MOJOÄ

The Reservoir Gods have released their fourth GodBoy game - "MegaMan".
This release sees a lot of  enhancements  to the emulator - Nemesis is
now fully supported and can be configured in the main menu. There is a
new load and save facility that allows you to save and reload games at
any point during play  -  very  handy  for  getting  past those tricky
bosses. MegaMan also features different colour palettes for each level
making it look ten times better than  the gameboy original. For a full
review, see else where in Maggie.


Å[] MUSICAL DIFFERENCESÄ

Ace composer Cedyn of shadows,  the  man behind the awesome soundtrack
to "Any Colour You Like" is set  to quite the Falcon scene. Apparently
he didn't get on with the  rest  of  the  group. NEWS JUST IN! Rumours
have it that Yonek has left the  Shadows  and the group have now split
it. More details in the next issue.


Å[] EXA-LENTÄ

French wizz coders, Exa, have been busy working on software for Phenix
creators Centek. They are working  on  a  Mario-Kart style game, which
was principally for the Centurbo board  and the Phenix, but their code
is so fast it you will also be able to run it on a standard Falcon.


Å[] IT AIN'T LIKE TATÄ

ÄRumours that Tat is about to  join  TSCC  are false. He was willing to
collaborate on their next demo,  but  TSCC's "n0 pr0mises" policy mean
that it is not certain when ( or if ) their next demo will show up.

Å[] LLAMA GEDDONÄ

Meanwhile, Llama of TSCC is busy coding effects for the forthcoming ST
Knights mega demo. Already famous for bring 4k bump-mapping to the ST,
his new effects should be  even  more impressive - environment mapping
on the humble ST!


Å[] SONO GOÄ

Tat has been busy working on Sono  2.  The remixed version of the demo
will have lots of extra effects  and  some impressive 3D worlds. He is
also working on a small intro  that  may  appear  on a future issue of
Maggie.


Å[] NEW CORE BLIMEYÄ

Swedish group New Core  are  busy  working  on  a  shoot-em-up for the
Falcon. Its called  'Offworld'  (  not  to  be  confused with Offworld
security ) and the early screenshots look very promising.


Å[] NOT SO STATIC NOWÄ

The Reservoir Gods are  beavering  away  on  a  new Puzzle game called
'STATIC'. "I don't want to give too much away" said a nervous Mr. Pink
"but here's 20p. Go  and  get  yourself  a  cup  of  tea.  But I'm not
interested in your bloody magazine!".  When  we explained we were from
Maggie and not The Big Issue, he was more revealing. "Its your classic
Reservoir Gods multi-player puzzle game.  Ace graphics from Ripley and
sh3 and some tearin' music from  MSG."  When  can we expect to see it?
"The game itself is finished - I  just  have to code the menu system."
And why is it called 'STATIC'? "Well if you get hungry, you can have a
nibble. You could try to eat  it!"  I'm  sure coders talk more rubbish
these days. Perhaps its the  lack  of  scrolltexts, they just slip the
craptalk into normal conversation.


Å[] RETURN OF THE PACÄ

Ed Cleveland has not spent his hours away from Donkey Island idly. His
next release will be a totally faithful conversion of Super Pacman for
the ST and Falcon. The Maggie  team  have  seen a preview and it looks
great.  Ed  has  even   properly   emulated  the  monsters  artificial
intelligence from the original (which  is  actually quite cunning). It
should be released by the time you read this.


Å[] FOR WEBBINGS AND A HTMLÄ

Have you heard of this new  interway  super information web thing that
ÄTony Blair invented? Do you  want  to  get  "in  the net"? ( slang for
surfing on your telephone ). But do  you know nothing about HMTL? Have
no fear, because now you can design  your web pages in first word plus
and convert the first word  files  into  HTML  with the Reservoir Gods
HTML convertor.


Å[] TOODLE-DOO THE RIGHT THINGÄ

Dead Hackers Society have just  released  a music demo. This showcases
the talents of new musicians Toodle-Doo.  For a full review, check out
the next issue of Maggie.


Å[] MIRWORKS AT APPROPRIATE TIMESÄ

News from our soon to  be  Canadian  correspondent. Apparently the Mir
space station computer system was  actually  a  Russian version of the
original STM. They had trouble  fixing  it  because their copy of disk
doctor got corrupted and that  British  born  astronaut  had to fly up
there with a copy of knife st  and  a new extender for the mouse port.
Rumours that they are religious readers  of  Maggie, shop in Tescos in
Bedford as the car park can easily accommodate a space ship, and enjoy
space fireworks at appropriate times couldn't be confirmed.


Å[] LAST NIGHT I HAD A DREAMÄ

News just in! The Reservoir  Gods  have  finally completed their fifth
GodBoy game. "Kirby's  Dreamland"  is  one  of  the  most  popular and
original gameboy games and now you can  play  it on your Falcon! It is
fully trained with an  ace  drum'n'bass  soundtrack  from MSG and some
spooky sound effects from sh3. "Kirby's Dreamland" will be released at
the Atari show in Birmingham.


Å[] CD MOBÄ

Do these people never sleep? The  Reservoir  Gods are busy compiling a
Falcon specific CD. This will contain  all their productions to date -
both standard and registered versions.  It  will  also include all the
issues of Maggie ( Falcon fixed ), lots of extra Double Bobble levels,
unreleased graphics from Ripley and sh3, and lots of mods from MSG and
sh3. All the Reservoir Gods  utilities,  applications and patches will
be included, and all the God-Boy  games  will  be on there. This looks
like an essential purchase for all  CD-ROM owning Falcon users! If you
want to find out  more  about  this  CD,  or  have any suggestions for
inclusions, email sh3_rg@hotmail.com


Å[] DARYL COMMUNICATIONÄ

Finally a big thank you must go to  Daryl Harkin. He sent us two 344mb
IDE drives to replace our ageing internal drives. These are now snugly
fitted in the machines of Mr Pink and  Tat of Avena so there is plenty
of room to fill them with all  the  stuff that coders need like Devpac
Äand, er, well, that's it. So a big  up  to the man like Harkin and the
Portsmouth massive from all at the Maggie team.
