-Indepedence Day - 
The Mistakes 
(Or was it purposeful mis-information?)

Okay, by now everyone and their pet martian has seen "Independence 
Day". However there are certain errors in the film which must be 
corrected, most envolving Area-51. (A-51 is the US military's 
worst kept secret Base)

1. Area-51 is surrounded by salt flats.
   
    Not true, Area-51 is in fact centered in a dry lake bed 
    (Groom Lake,Nevada) surrounded by mountain ranges.

2. Area-51 is surrounded by a big wire fence and guarded by 
   soldiers in black uniforms.

    Area-51 IS surrounded by a wire fence and it is BIG, and has 
    a radius of approximately 5-15 kilometres, incorporating all 
    the vantage points from which the base can be viewed. With 
    such a large perimeter the fence is only patrolled by guards 
    occasionally. Being caught inside the perimeter can met with 
    deadly force (the guards are armed)

3. Area-51 is easily accessible by Winnebago 

    Crap. "Your name's not down, you're not gettin' in."

4. Area-51 is part of a self-contained entity and is not part of 
   a larger complex.

    Area-51 has its own air line "Janet Airlines" for its staff 
    which apparently does not exist even though it has its own 
    airport in Las Vegas. Also reports have been received of 
    secret hangers within the mountain ranges surrounding the 
    base.

5. Area-51 contains the crashed Roswell craft in perfect working 
   order.

    More Crap! The UFO is in fact at Wright-Patterson Air Force 
    Base, Ohio.

Now for some truths about Area-51 (there are not many)

1. Area-51 is home of the Stealth Bomber.

2. Area-51 contains the largest single runway ever constructed, 
   but no one knows why it is so large (well someone must?).

3. Recent information suggests that A-51 housed a functional 
   stealth air craft, almost identical to the modern equivalent 
   as early as 1966.  It was photographed and was  mistaken for a 
   UFO.
