by Music Man Mike Noyce


'Young at Heart'

ÑThis time with the correct telephone number!! Sorry 'bout that.

The great thing about holidays is being able to stay up until 
everyone in the house is stirring for the next day and having all 
day to make up for it. Unlike being at college when you do the 
same thing but make for it in lectures instead of a cosy bed. A 
desk and notepaper it no substitute for a good old pillow.

A few weeks ago I was working on the computer in the early hours 
and had the TV on in the background (I work much better with a 
little background noise.) when my attention was violently 
wrenched from the monitor to the TV. The reason was not that some 
gorgeous woman was about to get her kit off and have sex with her 
male co-star, which is almost obligatory on late night TV, but 
the great music.

At university my friends and I liked to go to 70s/80s discos and 
bop the night away until we were too tired (or pissed) to do it 
any more. I think 80s music was much better than the terrible 
thousand-beats-per-minute-techno-rave-shit we have to suffer 
today, until Pop's recent fight back. Perhaps this explains the 
sudden surge in 80s albums appearing in high street record 
stores. It was this music that was emanating from the TV.

It was an advert for an 80s compilation album. "Great!" I thought 
"I'll buy that tomorrow." Alas it was of those albums 'not 
available in any shop' and would have to order it over the phone. 
A slight problem being the phone number had disappeared before I 
could write it down. A couple of days later, when I'd finally 
managed catch the ad again and get the number, I ordered it and 
eagerly awaited for it to arrive.

Three weeks later, just when where-the-fuck-is-it syndrome was 
starting to develop, it arrived. The poor old Jiffy bag was 
unceremoniously ripped open and its innards pulled out.

'Young at Heart' comes on six, yes, six CDs! Each CD has 15 songs 
lasting approximately 60 minutes, making a total playing time of 
5 hours 49 minutes and 51 seconds and at just under ú40.00 is 
excellent value for money. Each CD inlay contains a few lines of 
notes about each song and/or artist which I found quite 
interesting.

A couple of friends and I spent quite a few hours listening to 
the songs reminiscing about our teenage years and eventful nights 
in the discos as the music bought memories flooding back. 
Everyone seemed to have their favourites.

There are few songs missing that I would've liked to have been 
included. Perhaps they will be included in another compilation. 
Generally, the choice of songs is very good with one or two 
exceptions, but that's a matter of personal opinion. An excellent 
compilation in terms of music and value for money.

'The Best... Album in the World... Ever!' (Parts 1, 2, and 3)

As I mentioned above. Britpop has made a bit of a come back these 
last few years with such bands as Pulp, Blur, Oasis, and other 
bands of a similar vein producing songs you can actually listen 
to without getting a thumping headache from no-talent techno 
songs.

The popularity of these bands and their music is reflected not 
only in the sales of their own albums but also the enormous 
success of these three double CD compilation albums, each of 
which has topped the album chart at some point or another.

Each album features a selection of the cream of British guitar 
pop from the past three years, give or take the occasional 
exception, such as Whale's 'Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe' on the 
second CD and oldies like Iggy Pop's 'Lust for Life' on the 
third. Amongst the many groups featured are favourites like: 
Oasis, Blur, Ash, Elastica, Stone Roses, Manic Street Preachers, 
Jesus Jones, Skunk Anansie, The Chemical Brothers, Leftfield, 
Supergrass, Garbage, New Order, Pulp, Radio Head, The Lightning 
Seeds, and many, many more. There are other artists and bands 
featured that maybe don't quite fit in with the Britpop genre 
that happened to have a top ten hit when the album was released 
and it is debateble whether they should strictly be included but 
are popular hits all the same. Having said that, there are those 
songs that should never have been included, even if they did get 
to number one in the charts, such as Babylon Zoo's one-hit-wonder 
'Spaceman' and anything by Tosh.

If you're into the current British music scene then these three 
albums are an absolute must have. Each one has hit after hit 
after hit.


Steve Vai - 'Fire Garden'

This is the most recent addition to my collection. I didn't even 
realise it was out until I saw the poster in the record shop. I 
would have thought at least one of my friends, knowing I am a big 
Vai fan and have all his previous albums, would have told me 
about it. Having said that, I was less than impressed with 
Steve's last release, 'Alien love secrets', which I thought was a 
bit shite, so I was perhaps more cautious than I might have been 
and decided to listen to it in the shop first. After about 
fifteen minutes I was sold, as was the CD, to me!

The album is divided into two distinct halves. The first being 
instrumental and the second vocal. As with most Vai albums each 
song is a different style ranging from the normal 'look how fast 
I can play my guitar' heavy rock song, with lots of twiddly 
guitar work or fret-wanking as my friends and I like to call it, 
to the soft/gentle rock ballad. As well as these there are also 
the odd very weird and even 'experimental' songs that are very 
much influenced by Steve's past association with Frank Zappa and 
feature prominently on Steve's first album 'Flexable'. Steve's 
previous albums all had a unique feel to them and this album 
seems to draw from all the best bits from each.

With the exception of  'Passion and Warfare', this is the only 
Vai album I have liked immediately, without having to listen to 
it several times first, as was the case with 'Flexable' and, to a 
lesser extent, 'Sex and Religion'. All things considered this is 
a mighty good album that has reafirmed Steve Vai as one of my 
favourite musical artists.
