The first of all please tell me your real name (I know of coz, but 
maybe our readers not), age...

My name is Gilles Audoly, I'm 22. I'm living in Nice, one of the nicest 
town in the south of France. We're going to the beach on summer, and 
skiing on winter. I really love this part of the country. I hope that I 
could work here, once my studies over. I'm studying mathematics and 
computer science at the university of Nice, and next year, I hope to 
study in an ingenior school in Sophia Antipolis, near Nice.

- Which computers did you own before (ST/Amiga/PC) ???

AMSTRAD CPC464 (1984-87) 
ATARI 520STF, single side drive (1987) 
ATARI 1040STE (1990)

- For how long are you on the Falcon scene ???

I'm on the falcon scene since may 1993. I got a developper falcon. I 
started quickly to code (small) demos. The first week, I made the first 
bound demo, and the funny program call burp. (like "BURPPP!")

- How many groups there are in France ???

I don't know. I think there are between 5 and 10 good demo groups. 
Anyway, a lot of demos were made in France, by several groups, but most 
of the time, they are more funny than impressing.

- What do you think about the Falcon scene ???  

Well, It's a very difficult question to answer for me. It seems, that 
there are a lot of lies between the customers and the programmers. Lot 
of polls are made by some people to ask to the customers what kind of 
program they would like to have, and if they would buy some. All those 
polls are sent to the "Falcon" compagny to make them believe in doing 
falcon programs. I think they are just funny. They'd like to make us 
believe that doing a falcon program could give money enough to live.

This is the pretty part of the French Falcon scene. The worst part is 
the insults you get by lame coders that are jealous. Foreign people 
seem to be for friendly. I'm connecting sometime to the atari channel 
on irc. It's nice to speak to people that are very far from you, and 
that you would probably never meet. Anyway, I really can't stand the 
people, that are lame coder, and that are telling me they would do Moon 
Speeder much better. I think they just are too young and they should 
have never done anything, to tell me this.

- What do you want see more on the Falcon (games/demos/tools) ??? 

I am not a customer. I'm spending 99% of time on the falcon to code. 
The 1% left is spent to fix the graphics for the games or the demos I'm 
doing. 

Then, I'm not playing a lot to games. I'm watching demo to compare 
myself to the others. Now, I think that the tools for falcon are good. 
We have apex to draw, digital tracker (and lot of others) to make 
music, and assemble and devpac to code in assembly. (Pure C for c 
coders)  

- I heard about a very good situation of the Falcon in France 
(newspaper only for F030 users) - This is truth ???

Yes it's truth, that we are what we call "fanzine". But there's still 
only one really serious magazine in France: ST Magazine. I used to 
write for Faucontact, but I stopped, because some of them are really 
too young to run a magazine. They thought they were the best magazine, 
but now, It's more and more difficult for them, the magazine is made 
more and more rarely. 

There are other fanzines in France: Power Falcon Magazine (very good, 
the best one, now), St echos (very stupid one. It is run by old atari 
st crackers. They even tried to make me have troubles with CompoScan 
France).

- I saw your fantastic game - Moon Speeder. I think this is the best 
game  on the Falcon. In the issue 73 of ST format I read: Moon Speeder 
is a su- perb demonstration of the Falcon's graphical capabilities...).  
How long did it takes to do this game ???

Well, from january 1993 (yes january, before having my Falcon) to may 
1994, I worked on a game called Moon Spy. This game was supposed to be 
very very good. (10 times better than Moon Speeder). It was supposed to 
be a 3D game of a spy on the Moon. The 3D was very nice, but it was 
very difficult to do what I planned to, and the Falcon wasn't powerful 
enough to do it.

In Jannuary 1994 I made a small demo called MiniF1 flight, that was a 
simple ground mapping of a very big picture. Finaly, in may 1994, I 
decided to start MoonSpeeder. I took the 3D routines from Moon Spy, and 
the ground mapping from the demo, that I improved a lot, with David 
Virebayre. 2 weeks later, the game and the track modeler were done. I 
mean that they were working, and we could already have fun in moving a 
speeder. The great speeder movement was made for MoonSpy too. The 
speeder was supposed to be the Moon car in the year 2090.

Then, I can't really tell how much time it took. All the printing 
routines were made before. It also took 6 months to build the tracks, 
and to do the game. during those 6 months, I worked a lot. During the 
summer, I was working more than 10 hours a day almost 7 days a week.

- I heard about new version of this game. This is truth ???

Yes, it is MoonGames, avaible since july 4th. It is not only a new 
version of this game, and the most important, is that the game is free. 
(Please note that I'm not spreading it. Working for free, is much 
enough already, I don't want to spend my time in copying disks)

- Maybe some words to our readers ??? 

Have fun with your Falcon, and with Moon Games.

- Thanks for interwiev. Good luck in your work on the Falcon. Stay Cool. 
Thanks, It was nice from you to do this interview, my first one.

Hi Crac ! Yes, I know, this article was wrote esp. for our "Scream" 
zine, but I really don't know when it see light of day. I decided send 
it to  Maggie magazine and I think it's good choice !
