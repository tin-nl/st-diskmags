What is where in the Retro computing market..

Some recent second hand prices of common and less common hardware makes 
for some revealing reading..

Atari 2600 VCS.. (probably original fake wood-panelled dashboard of 
Mark III 1973 Ford Cortina look model) People attending any Atari Shows 
in the last couple of years would have got a bargain for a tenner (as 
new and boxed).. These are now holding at 25 UKP..

Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.. Fairly common hardware, both typically 
sell for around 35 UKP.. (Car boot sales often have this sort of price 
level with a full collection of software and peripherals)..

Original Oric (similar to early ZX Spectrum, 6502 processor and 
calculator style keyboard) described as "Rare but unloved.." Oh dear!

Sinclair ZX81, from memory, I think this was about 25 UKP..

Now we are getting expensive..

One example of a Sinclair ZX80, the predecessor to the ZX81, was 
reported to have sold at 250 UKP! It is not known if this was a one-
off, or reflective of the gneral price level, but ZX80's were not 
nearly as common as ZX81's, which was practically the first mass market 
hardware here in the UK..

The winner in the retro computer collectors piece race is the Vectrex 
Console.. This was a machine with its own built-in monitor screen, and 
worked in a similar way to a lot of early Atari arcade hardware.. It 
put vector lines, rather than pixels onto the screen.. "Colour" changes 
were achieved by adding coloured strips of transparent plastic to the 
screen! A recent example changed hands for over 400 UKP!! Peripherals 
for this machine are even rarer than the actual unit itself, and 
command even higher prices..

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

It will be interesting to see what becomes 'valuable' in the eyes of 
collectors next.. My own personal candidates for collectibility include 
such long lost machines as the Jupiter Ace, Camputers Lynx, Elan 
Enterprise (why did I sell mine?)) and even the Sinclair QL..

Things like the BBC computers were just too common, and the MSX series 
were a bit too bland, although the dedicated Yamaha MSX based music 
computer might become a collectible as well..
  
To try to guess where the best place to put your money might be..

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Sinclair ZX80, and earlier machines such as Mark 14 programmable 
Calculator.. Yep, the ZX80 is already commanding a huge price, and the 
Mark 14 is even rarer.. (1980)

Sinclair ZX81.. Nope, there are just too many ZX81's shoved away into 
attics to make it truly collectible.. A complete set with some 
interesting peripherals might make it more of an investment, say 
Sinclair branded thermal printer with original silver paper.. Someone 
even did hi-res (256 x 192 pixels) graphics adapters, and a colour 
adapter that never really worked.. (1981)

Sinclair ZX Spectrum.. Cheap and cheerful and too many of them, 
collectibility destroyed by its original success.. This is one which is 
often emulated by software, giving easier access to the classic games 
than the original could ever provide.. (1982 to late eighties) Early 
original 'Rubber Keys' machine with full Sinclair orange manuals 
better..

Sinclair QL.. Their last computer.. Possibly, it was the first 
affordable 16-bit Motorola based machine before Atari and Commodore got 
there.. Based on Motorola 68008, which was a cut-down 68000 with 8-bit 
bus access.. Neat matt-black styling and rounded keys.. Computing for 
the yuppie Habitat generation.... Hampered by Microdrive storage.. 
Never really mass market, but still fairly popular with an active 
Sinclair loyalist user culture for a long time after.. Collectible in 
not too distant future? (1984-5)

Commodore Pet.. A true antique (c. 1977?) with some fairly radical 
styling for the time, very early examples had a calculator type 
keyboard.. 6502 based and integral green screen monitor.. Not a lot 
doing in the sound and graphics dept.. A workhorse computer which 
turned up in a lot of educational establishments and got worked to 
death accordingly..  Also had a 'secret' ROM access or poke which could 
damage the hardware.. Could go either way, but I'd bet fully 
functioning survivors are very rare..

Commodore Vic 20..First Commodore mass market computer.. Overshadowed 
by subsequent success of Commodore 64.. Maybe collectible with full 
set of peripherals.. (c.1980?)

Commodore 64.. Nope, same arguments against as for ZX Spectrum.. More 
famous for the games than the hardware and much emulated as well.. 
(1983-present)

Commodore C16 and Plus 4 series. One of Commodores less comprehensible 
fits of madness pre-CDTV.. Offering absolutely nothing, and indeed 
somewhat less in most areas, over their world beating C64, apart from 
some cheap and cheerful productivity software in the ROM of the Plus 
4.. No one wanted the C16 now they could have 48/64K of RAM on other 
computers, and the more demanding games that ran on these.. The Plus 4 
was marginally more useful with a full 64K of RAM.. Both machines 
quietly slipped out of sight thereafter.. (1984-5) Miscelleny note, 
Tat, our lead 3-D effects and swirly things coder once owned a Plus 
Four!

Commodore 128.. Chunkier looking unit than the classic C64.. It ran 
both 6502 and Z80 processors, the former to cash in on the C64 
hardware, the latter an attempt to get some easy 'business' credibility 
with access to CP/M, the early universal software standard.. See C64 
above..

Apple II series.. The first home/hobbyist computer, that started it all 
off.. Not really big here in the UK and a bit too American for me to 
judge.. (1976 on)

Apple Lisa.. The predecessor to the Mac, less of a viable computer and 
more of a beta test laboratory for most of the ideas that were used in 
the Mac and other computers such as the ST, Amiga, and Windows PC.. A 
commercial flop, very expensive initially, rare as a result, and 
probably very collectible if you have one!

Atari VCS series console, 2600 onwards.. A budget option for 
collectors.. The ú25 'official' list price belies the fact that some 
real bargains can be found at car boot sales and such like.. You might 
be better off trying to look for rare game cartridges as well..(1978 on)

Atari 8-Bit computers, 400 series on.. Very technically advanced for 
their day with first 'custom' hardware.. Still viable coding hardware 
in E.Europe..  Not sure about these, never came to prominence in this 
country as initially expensive but sold for ages at retail so not that 
uncommon either, might be more of a hot item in the US.. Again, rare 
models not available in the UK and peripherals might be your best bet.. 
Good for demo collectors with decent E.European contacts! (1980 on?)

Acorn Atom.. The first Acorn home computer, pre-BBC and pre home 
computer boom, based around a 6502 cpu, and often built up from kit 
form.. Curiosity value from the amateur solderer hobbyist days..(1980?)

**Other kit build machines pre-ZX81**

UK101, the full system ended up with about 8K of RAM.. Pictures of this 
unit always seemed to show it in a case-off pose for some reason..

Tangerine computer.. The end result was quite a respectable piece of 
kit in a huge metal box..

****

Acorn BBC series.. A machine that was initially expensive.. Some people 
had to wait a year for delivery, and only really caught on in schools, 
where it vastly outlived what would have been its natural lifespan in 
the home computing market.. 6502 based with rugged hardware, good 
software, decent firmware, good disk (5.25 inch) handling, expandable, 
and it played a mean game of Elite! The classic computer buffs machine, 
but not really that rare.. Model A had 16K of RAM and disappeared 
quickly, the ubiquitious Model B, a useable 32K RAM.. Also BBC 64k and 
Master 128k later on as well (Announced end of 1981)

Acorn Electron.. Ultimately unsuccessful attempt to make a cheap cut 
down coffee table version of the BBC.. Through a miracle of cost 
engineering, the complex BBC innards were shoehorned into a bijou half-
sized keyboard.. Proper keys still, but most of the ports that made the 
BBC uniquely useful to schools and hobbyists were lost.. Part of the 
problem was that this 'cheap' Acorn machine started out not 
particularly cheap and lost ground to other more popular computers.. 
These still quite common, although not quite as much as Speccys (1983?) 

Jupiter Ace.. Best described as a white ZX81 lookalike and a throwback 
to the hobbyist computer days as it used FORTH rather than BASIC as its 
onboard language.. Ex-Sinclair Research folk did this one.. Z80 based, 
small RAM (about 4k, I think) limited potential and thus trodden into 
the dirt by the rising ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 home computers.. 
Quirky and rare enough to collect.. (1982)

Oric.. The company who made the Tangerine (cf) attempted to tackle the 
emerging home computer market with this effort.. It was a ZX Spectrum 
concept-a-like, with 6502 main processor, calculator style keys, about 
the same amount of RAM and an oddly positioned reset button underneath 
the machine which meant that you had to flip the unit over to reset 
it.... It also had a real soundchip that allowed "authentic" arcade 
sounds such as 'ping' and 'explode'.. It was also heavily bugged and 
did not catch on too much.. The subsequent and debugged Oric Atmos, 
with a new case and cut-down real keyboard followed on, but it was too 
late.. A further more technically advanced model, the Stratos may have 
had a limited release in France before the company went bust.. 
Described as 'rare but unloved' in collecting circles.. Could be one to 
watch in the future?? (1982)

Dragon 32.. Appeared at the same time as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and 
attempted to rival it.. Same lineage as Tandy Colour computer, used 
early Motorola 6809 cpu.. Brittle plastic feel and infinitely green 
screen display.. Parent company taken over by Mettoy, who developed the 
'professional' Dragon 64, (64K RAM) based around floppy disks, who also 
then went bust.. Quite popular in its day.. Collectors appeal.. Wait 
around a bit longer to see? (1982)

Vectrex.. Out of everyone's price range!! See the 'Maggie Guide to a 
classic Videogame Lifestyle' for futher details..

Tandy TRS 80.. A complete home/office jack of all trades system.. Built 
around the winning Z80/CP/M combination, this was the first 'proper' 
computer for many people. Starting with a tape-driven system with 
negligible RAM etc, and built up into quite a respectable workstation 
with floppy drives, dedicated monitor etc.. Most famous user of one of 
these was Isaac Asimov who had quite a hefty W/P setup and Tandy Corp 
made sure the rest of the world knew.. Ultimately fell behind as 
lacking colour graphics and sound, this machine falls firmly into the 
'pre-golden age of home computing' camp.. Probably more US than UK 
interest as at its height pre-Sinclair.. (1979?)

Tandy Colour Computer.. (See Dragon 32) Less charismatic US cousin of 
the Dragon 32, used much the same firmware, a duller case design, but 
not quite fully software compatible.. Used to be seen in Tandy stores 
everywhere.. Same interest level as a wet Wednesday morning.. (1982?)

NewBrain.. Funny little Z80 based computer that had a fairly decent 
spec for its day, and was sold as a 'serious' home machine wih office 
type software.. Distinctive keyboard, lost out as not able to fit in as 
a decent home entertainment machine, or a proper high-spec business 
tool.. (1982) These will be rare..

Texas Instruments Ti99 series.. A fairly serious early attempt at doing 
an integrated home computer a la Atari. Smart design, proper keyboard, 
expensive cartridge based software, even an early 16-bit CPU of Texas 
Instruments own design.. Success did not follow, as the machines were 
pitched too high, then ludicrously cheap.. A cut down version foolishly 
followed at the time that Sinclair and Commodore were starting to make 
giant strides in the field of home computing, and it was all over for 
them.. Nowadays, Texas Instruments quietly do what they should have 
stuck to in the first place, making IC's for air to ground missiles, or 
something.. Very rare as one of the first makes to drop out.. I saw one 
with a full set of manuals at a car boot sale locally once!! (1980?)

Osborne.. Not a home computer really, but notable here as the first 
attempt at a portable system, long before the term 'Laptop' had been 
invented.. This was a 'luggable', like trying to carry a very heavy 
suitcase with the combined weight of computer and battery pack.. These 
were also the times before the term 'Liquid Crystal flat screen' had 
been coined, it had its own small cathode ray tube monitor as well 
built into the case.. Quite expensive back then, and sold as a business 
machine.. As it was Z80 based, CP/M, the 'Windows' of its day was the 
main operating system..  A collectors curiosity for people who have 
everything apart from a hernia.. (1982?)

Mattel Aquarius.. Toy firm Mattel's entry to the home computer market.. 
Nothing really to write home about.. (1982)

Camputers Lynx.. This might have had ex-Sinclair people involved in it 
as well.. Seemed to be a subconscious attempt to remedy the worst 
defects of the ZX Spectrum, as it had proper keyboard, and a large 
chunk of the 48K memory was dedicated to the screen display.. Self 
consciously held each individual pixel in memory, so no screen 
attribute clash.. However, the amount of user RAM left was pitiful, 
about 13K, I think. There was an 80K model as well, but this did not 
save it from becoming one of life's also-rans.. A devoted user group 
kept it going for a long time after it ceased to be.. Probably cool to 
collect if you can find one.. (1983)

Tatung Einstein.. A chunky looking beast spawned by a Far Eastern 
company Tatung.. This was wrapped around the inevitable Z80 CPU, and 
came in a rugged cream coloured box with up to 80K of RAM, and things 
like CP/M included.. Memory, which sometimes does not serve me very 
well, seems to suggest that this machine ran from floppy drives, and 
was the sort of machine that the monitor sat on top of.. Decent but not 
exceptional graphics and sound.. You might occasionally see one for 
sale in Micromart.. (prob. 1984)

Memotech Computer.. Another machine based around the then, ubiquitous 
Zilog Z80 cpu.. A smart matt-black C64 style case, decent 64K worth of 
RAM, ok graphics and sound, even multiple languages built into the ROM 
still did not save it.. (1984?) Nice machine, but seems to lack 
sufficient personality to collect? Memotech started out by making 
beautifully engineered non-wobbly RAM-packs for the Sinclair ZX81..

Elan Enterprise.. One of the best 8-Bit computers that never made it.. 
The gestation was tragically over-long, as it was announced in 1984, 
but did not make it until it was too late a year later.. Radical 
moulded case design, colour-coded plastic keys, and stubbly joystick 
built into the keyboard distinguished it.. Another machine based around 
the Z80, but with decent custom hardware too.. The first home computer 
capable of 128K RAM, the second home computer (after Atari 8-bit) 
capable of 256 colours onscreen.. It could also interlace screen modes 
to get a then unheard of 672 x 512 pixels onscreen (with 128k RAM).. 
With an add-on module, it was even able to handle the then very new 3.5 
inch floppy disks..

Most software consisted of ZX Spectrum ports, but one or two excellent 
games, and a strong user group.. Made in Germany as the Mephisto.. A 
Z80B (6mhz) powered professional version with 320K RAM was announced, 
but never made.. (1985) Potentially collectible, difficult to find..

Amstrad CPC series.. Boring.. This one was flogged long after it became 
a  dead horse.. Technically sound, reliable, widely available 
secondhand, successful, bland and dull.. Classic car boot fodder..
If there is such a thing as a 'rare' CPC machine, try and find a CPC 
664, the 64k model with a 3 inch floppy drive which got replaced by 
the commoner 128k model.. (1984)

MSX.. Various Japanese brand names.. Technically sound, well built, but 
fighting against the emergence of Sinclair QL, and proto 16 Bit 
market.. Also retailed crappily in disinterested Hi Fi shops.. Also 
some anti-Japanese computer press feeling who were rattled by MSX.. 
They were a little too conservative for UK tastes as well to be honest, 
so they never took off.. Individual machines were made with more 
specific tasks in mind.. The Yamaha version expanded to become a full 
blown FM synthesiser with add on keyboard and is both uncommon and well 
worth getting.. Sony did one called the 'Hit Bit'.. The most common one 
in the UK was the Toshiba version, which was a rather bland 
machine..(1984-5)

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

So, you wanna go and score some serious 8-Bit action, where can you 
go?? 

Well I find that a good place to start is Micromart, the second hand 
sellers publication, as amongst all the pages and pages of PC stuff, 
there are still odd adverts for classic machines.. You just have to be 
prepared to wade through pages of guff to get there.. The contacts 
pages in the same magazine may just have details of some surviving user 
groups and like minded individuals..

Car boot sales are a good place to score a complete system, often with 
software at a bargain price, just make sure that the thing works.. The 
people selling these aren't usually thinking of a collectors market, 
although that might change one day..

I trust the above has been of some help and memories stirred.. Anyone 
who wants to fill in any gaps in this account for a future issue, or 
tell me about their 8-Bit computing days by all means drop me a line..
