A couple of years  ago  the  information  shown  below  could have been 
worth Millions to certain mineral water manufacturers, you could still 
save yourself a few quid by following the  procedures  set  out  below.  
Although I doubt it would be very cost-effective.


At last, after over 100 years of  total  secrecy, the recipe for Coca-
Cola has been revealed in a new book by Mark Prendergast who claims to 
have found it on a piece of paper titled "X" in a company archive.

Anyway, here is the method in full :

Take 
   Coriander Oil      (a trace) 
   Orange Blossom Oil (a trace) 
   Orange Oil         (0.94g) 
   Lemon Oil          (1.79g) 
   Nutmeg Oil         (0.14g) 
   Cinnamon Oil       (0.41g) Mix them in alcohol    (9.97g) 
         and water    (5.50g)

Shake well and let stand for 24  hrs.  The  mixture will separate.  At 
the top will be a clear  yellow  liquid,  this  is  the  Cokes secret 
"7X" flavouring. Dissolve Sugar (4.88kg) in a tiny amount  of boiling 
water and allow to cool.


Add Caramel            (73g) 
   Caffeine           (6.3g) 
   Phosphoric Acid    (22.4g)

A sprinkling of powdered nut from the Kola tree, and purists may add
   Coca Leaf          (2.24g) after first removing the cocaine!

You should now have a thick syrup.
Add Lime Juice         (61g) 
   Glycerin           (38.7g) 
   Vanilla Extract    (3.05g) and "7X".

Stir hard and dilute with 5.5 parts chilled carbonated water.
You should now have 50 litres of Coca-Cola!  Easy really!
