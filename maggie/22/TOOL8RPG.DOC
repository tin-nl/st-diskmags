                        -------------------- 
                         PREVIEW BY MR PINK 
                        --------------------
 
Tool 8 Technologies may be one  of  the  Falcon crews to watch out for 
1997. The have a team of atari fanatics bursting with enthusiasm. They 
are busy creating numerous games for  the  falcon,  but the one in the 
most advanced state of completion is their RPG.

Apart from the Ishar series, the Falcon is lacking decent role playing 
games, and Tool  8's  game  concentrates  more  on joystick controlled 
movement rather than just dull old point and click.

The first thing  that  you  notice  when  loading  this  game  are the 
graphics. They are absolutely gorgeous! Hades has done a fantastic job 
especially on all the background scenery.

The character you  guide  around  moves  with  an  almost  comical hip 
swaying waddle. The game is  all  viewed  from  overhead from a forced 
perspective. Even in the preview version  there  is quite a large area 
to explore.

I started in the cobbled streets  of  the  town which is surrounded by 
fortified walls. Outside of here  there  is  grassland and some woods. 
There is also a cute little graveyard!

In the finished game  there  will  be  a  lot  of  other characters to 
interact with, to talk to, bargain with and fight! You will be able to 
go into some of the houses and shops.

A neat touch is  the  fact  that  you  walk  behind  some areas of the 
scenery (e.g. the railings) and  in  front  of  others. This gives the 
game play area a sense of depth and realism.

The frame rate is slightly disappointing  at the moment, but then this 
is a role playing game and  the  scrolling speed is pretty irrelevant. 
As long as there is a decent plot I will be happy!

Any good feature is  the  fact  that  the  game  works  happily on VGA 
monitors as well as RGB monitors.

A lot of work has obviously gone into designing this opening level and 
drawing the graphics. Let us  hope  the  same attention to detail goes 
into the gameplay and we will have  an  RPG to treasure. As Oasis say, 
you gotta Role with it! (You're sacked again. Ed)
