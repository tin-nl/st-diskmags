Well it has been a pretty busy time in  Atari land in the couple of 
months since Maggie 21. Here is a roundup of some of the more 
interesting pieces of news that have reached the Maggie team's ears.
 
* FRANCE ***********************************************************************
 
[] PHENIX FROM THE FLAMES
Centek , an innovative company,  are  working  on  a  brand new Atari 
clone "The Phenix". This is kitted out with  a  66Mhz  68040,  32 Bits 
Bus, 66Mhz 56302 DSP which can access main memory! There  will  also  
be a 120Mhz 68060 version. Both machines will both run a  new  multi-
tasking  AES  compatible TOS called Dolmen. This sound like the 
machine of all Atari owners dreams!

[] CENTEK'S BOARD OF THE FLIES
Centek are releasing two Falcon upgrade board  to rival the Phenix. 
The Centurbo 1 features speeds your system up to 25Mhz  CPU  and bus, 
50Mhz DSP, FPU & Videl. The Centurbo II board features a 75mhz 030  
and  FPU,  a simm slot for TT ram, 2 ISA slots and a slot for a Dolmen 
Eprom.

[] ARTO OF FRANCE
Hydroxid have now split.  The  talented  coding  team  responsible for 
"Realm Of Depth", "Symposium 96 Demo" and the Maggie  21  intro  have 
decided to call it a day. Graphist Nitrik is now working  for  an  
Amiga  crew, whilst artist Saya is spending all his time on his  
Playstation.  Main coder Arto has joined Reservoir Gods and he has 
committed  himself  to  continue  coding  on the Falcon. We will 
perhaps see a demo from him in time for the Siliconvention.

[] PAWN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY
Gaston, the coder behing the "Earth" screen reviewed in Maggie 21 is 
busy coding a chess game for the Falcon. A lot of  work has already 
gone into the game logic as it was originally designed for  a  college 
project. Unfortunately Gaston will have to be quick  in  finishing  
his  projects  because  he  starts his military service in February.

[] GRAOUMF CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM
Highly acclaimed tracker program has received  a  major upgrade with a 
brand new version being released in December. There  are  lots  of 
extras buttons and bits and bobs (very technical  review  this)  and  
what  is  already  the best Falcon tracker has just got better.

[] THE TOMB OF YOUR LIFE
Tool 8 technologies have got out their  video  camera and digitizer 
and are busy creating an adventure game for  the  Falcon.  Entitled  
"TOMBSTONE" it will be a graphical adventure game. This will  feature  
some nice animated sequences using Guillame Tello's AVI player. Work 
on  this  game has been temporarily halted due to the cold weather, as 
the game is set in the summer scanned pictures of winter trees would 
look out of place.

[] HIT THE ROAD DAKOTA JACK
Using a similar game engine  to  "Tombstone",  Tool  8 technologies 
are creating another adventure game in the style of Indiana Jones 
called "Dakota Jack". It is 1938, you are Los Angeles based  
archaeologist  and  pilot Dakota Jack. You must travel the world 
searching for the lost  civilisation.  But you are not alone in your 
quest, ruthless enemy secret services are also hot on the trail.
 
* GERMANY **********************************************************************
 
[] RAIDERS OF THE LOST MARKUS
"Cosmic", Markus Binder's 3D shoot-em-up  that  was  previewed  in 
Maggie 21 has undergone some changes. The title has changed to 
"Starraider". The graphics have also been improved a lot and there 
will be many added animation sequences. It is currently on 8 High 
Density disks!  The  Maggie  team  has seen some new preview shots of 
Starraider and it is looking rather tasty!

[] EVERBODY'S SILCON
It looks like the Siliconvention will  be  going  ahead this year 
instead of the Fried Bits. There  will  probably  also  be  a  
Symposium  in  Hamburg,  but the Siliconvention will be more Atari 
oriented. It  looks likely that the venue will be the Burgerhaus in 
Bremen, the same  place  where  Fried Bits III was held. If there is 
going to be a large turnout  of the Atari community, then the 
Reservoir Gods and the Maggie team will probably attend.
 
* SWEDEN ***********************************************************************
 
[] IMPROBABLE
Dead Hacker's Society and Imponance held  the  IMParty IV from 
December 27-30 in the frozen wasteland of Grangesberg.  There  was  
the  possibility of some small demo releases. Members of the Reservoir  
Gods were invited, but unfortunately we couldn't make it as we were 
travelling to  Paris  at the time. More news on this event in the next 
issue of Maggie.

[] WILLIE'S GETTING BIGGER
Willie the adventurer is  progressing  in  leaps  and  bounds. Main 
coder Daniel Hedberg tells Maggie "Almost all program code  has been 
rewritten to optimize it to the maximum We're now sure that  the  game  
will  run on full frame rate on a standard Falcon030 with everything 
included.  There  might  be a slightly chance that we will have  to  
remove  either  the  parallax  scrolling or sound effects though. If 
you're a happy owner  of  a  Nemesis accelerator or Afterburner there 
will be a third parallax layer as well, it will be in 64 colours and 
in front of the other graphics. "

There should be a new preview version out soon.

[] PATCH OF THE DAY
New Beat Development have released a patch for  Magic 5 which speeds 
up the boot up sequence. Now Magic doesn't  spend  an  eternity  
searching  for all your IDE drives. The Magic patch should be  
compatible  with all past and future versions of Magic.

[] A SHORT DEMO ABOUT FILLING
New demo crew WRC,  (responsible  for  one  production  entitled 
Tecno) are busy putting the finishing  touches  to  a  demo  entitled  
"PETROL".  This is almost complete and should be out very soon. They  
are also busy on a game called "Math Ship". More details as we get 
them...
 
* UNITED KINGDOM ***************************************************************
 
[] TITAN TIME
There has been a delay in  the  release  of  the Nemesis board. The 
hardware has been finished for months, but Titan have  been spending 
some time on the manual. Getting all the diagrams right  took  some  
time  - installation should be quite straightforward, but you need to 
see exactly what  is to be done and where. Then they changed the 
person running their fitting scheme from a guy in Nottingham to The 
Upgrade Shop and they had to change all references to him in the 
manual. The current news is that the manual is at  the  printers but 
has been delayed by the christmas rush. Let us hope it has been 
released by the time you read this.

[] BSS CONDUCTOR
Rumours are rife that the Black Scorpion  development  team are 
working on a new piece of software for the Falcon. This appears  to  
be in the music field, so it may be tracker or sequencer  package.  
Titan  supremo  David Encill is currently remaining tight lipped (and 
possibly Ashen faced).

[] YOU GOTTA ROLAND WITH IT
The Reservoir Gods are working on  a  line  of  Midi editors for the 
Falcon. The first release will be a patch editor for  the Roland 
Super-JV 1080. This will be followed by a similar program for the E-Mu  
orbit.  We are also setting up a new web site which will contain all 
our latest releases.

[] EFFECT HAVE THE NERVE TO MAKE XMAS DEMO
Effect are planning to release a Christmas  demo,  this will be coded 
by Sinbad. No, not the window cleaner from  Brookside  but coder 
Martin Cubitt. Effect also have two new members, Phygorax and  Nerve  
-  apparently  one is an ex-member of Wildfire.
 
* POLAND ***********************************************************************
 
[] TWISTED FIRESTARTER
The version of Shadow's "Firestarter" demo  currently  doing the round 
is a beta version that wasn't supposed to be released! The Maggie team 
has Firestarter+ an updated version of the demo with  improved  
graphics and effects. We are however under strict instructions not to 
spread it,  as  it is going to be improved even further. There will be 
an enhanced version of this demo released soon.

[] SHADOW OVER SYMPOSIUM
Top Falcon demo team  Shadows  are  already  busy  working  on  the 
follow up to "Firestarter". An inside source  revealed  to  Maggie  
that  the new effects are "really amazing". This demo should be 
presented at the Siliconvention.

[] THE CAT AND THE MATT
Hardware manufacturers Matt have developed  an  inovative new 
controller for the Jaguar. It is called the "boomerang" because of its 
similarity to the australian sporting stick. If you are Jag owner in 
search of a new controller, contact:
Matt 
ul. Wigury 15 
90-302 Lodz 
Poland                                       Tel:0048 (042) 36-84-33
A boomerang will set you back 42 PLN (about 9 UK pounds).

[] I WANNA GIVE YOU THE VOTION
Costek, main coder with ST demo crew "The  Votion" has turned his 
hands to games creating. He is busy creating a Warcraft  style  game 
for the ST, but needs some help in the graphics department.

[] WE HAVE IGNIS-ION
Falcon demo team  Pandemonium  are  busy  creating  their  first  
demo. Entitled "Ignis" it should see the  light  of  day  in  early  
January. We were hoping to receive a review copy for this issue of  
Maggie,  but it looks like we will have to wait until issue 22 as some 
of the graphics aren't yet complete.

[] THE FILLER'S TALE
It seems that Maggie now has competition  from  Poland in the form of 
Atari disk magazine "Filler". Unfortunately "Filler" is written  
entirely in Polish, but it has a slick interface and covers most areas 
of the atari scene.
 
* CROATIA **********************************************************************
 
[] 101 CROATIANS
Atari is apparently alive and  well  in  Croatia!  After  the last 
issue we were contacted by one  of  the  most  passionate  ST  and  
Falcon  owners,  one Deanu Radovnikovicu, who runs his own Atari BBS. 
You can visit Deanu's WWW site: http://public.srce.hr/~dradov
