The Maggie Awards 1996..

At this time of the year, certain well observed rituals go on, the 
thing that they do with fireworks called Guy Fawkes night for example, 
there are also many technicolour yawns and hangovers from the office 
Xmas party to look forward to, and indeed, I get down to writing about 
the Maggie awards about now.. (Which no doubt causes some technicolour 
yawns of its own..)


Without further ado;


Most Significant event of the year..

A big choice here, 1996 was a turbulent year, with slightly more 
goodbyes than hellos on balance.. Up on the nominations rostrum are the 
closure of Atari World and ST Format, the closure of ST News, the 
merger of Atari and JTS, also the opening of Atari Computing, and on a 
closer to home level, the Symposium and Autumn Atari shows.. 

I suppose it has to be the Atari/JTS merger, which meant the end of 
Atari, and its capacity to amaze with their marvellous products and 
disappoint us with their abysmal everything else.. Life won't be the 
same without them, certainly, emotionally calmer.. (And Atari/JTS also 
go in the 'biggest non-event' category as well!)


Best Game of 1996..

A lot of choice here, but we have to unpeel the previews from the full 
and finished games, otherwise 'Running' gets in without much of a 
challenge.. On a similar note, watch out for 'Willy the Adventurer' in 
1997.. Those two alone will make next year a vintage one for games..

This year, my favourite was Martin Steen's Defender clone 'Spice', 
pipping 'Skyfall' at the post.. Sorry..


Best Fiver Spent for 1996..

'Skyfall' by the Res Gods, top shareware for that price!! Neurobotix by 
one P. van der Meer, comes a very close second though..


Trend to most carefully watch..

People who set out to do quite ambitious games, and then don't complete 
them ('best games', see above).. We're on your case!!


"Told you so!" Award..

Look back on this entry to last year's 'trend to most carefully 
watch'.. Remember what happened this year.. Not even Atari World was 
safe, and in fact, it was the first to go.. 

Remember this??
__________________________________________________________________
Is  our print media all that stable and long-lasting?  There is  a 
distinct lack of subscription forms in recent issues of ST  Format 
which kind of suggests that there are not too many more of them to 
go.  When asked about this,  they said that the subscription pages 
had been dropped as the overall page count for ST Format had  gone 
down  and  they did not wish to waste space (66 pages  as  of  Jan 
'96!)  However,  this sounds as plausible as dropping the contents 
pages or front cover to save space..  We think time is running out 
for ST Format so get 'em whilst you can! At least Atari World seem 
to be around for the time being..

Am I the king of prophecy or what!!


Best Utility, serious doobrie of 1996..

A fair choice for this year with new releases in just about every 
category, my money is on the Nemesis Falcon accelerator though.. Which 
looks like it will *just about* make 1996!


Best music product of 1996..

Praise be to Cream, who not only gave us their rather neat ST-based 
music demos (which also worked on the Falcon), but especially for their 
Commodore 64 emulating SID Chip music player, which finally gave 
generations of Mad Max battered ST and Falcon owners the real thing 
they had been waiting for.. With Tat doing us a neat little converter 
program, the missing link was closed, and many hundreds of original 
C64 tunes are now at our mercy!!


Best Vapourware/Rumour of 1996..

With the final confirmed demise of Atari, not a lot doing on the 
serious side of things, but we are still awaiting the 'Motion Blur' 
demo from Aggression, and have been all this year.. (It is now just 
called the 'Motion' demo which must indicate progress of a sort!)


Diskmag of the year..

I'm pleased to have a clear winner in this category.. ST Plus (ST+) 
which was most definitely a child of 1996, grew from next to nowt, into 
one of the best diskmags out there.. It is monthly too, yes, a real 
monthly mag, not one which pretends to be but isn't.. Nice one Dave!!


Demo of the year..

A lesser field to work from this year.. Still several releases, but 
nothing (yet) to rival what was released in 1995.. I liked the 
Symposium 4k intros, even the one with the moronically religious text. 
The Aggression 128k intro just about gets into 1996 as the most 
polished work in that category.. Of the big stuff, well, there was some 
nice work by Hydroxid and Misfits to name two..

(After having said that, I've just seen the seminal Senior Dads work, 
the fantastic 'Air Dirt' demo which stands head and shoulders over 
everything else produced this year.. Clearly the work of a genius, if a 
very old genius receiving aftercare for a stroke related condition!)


Biggest Non-event of the year..

Atari finally owning up to their lack of nous in several areas, and 
calling it a day by merging with JTS Corp..


Yellow Press Sulphuric Acid resistant Swimming trunks award..

Future Publishing always manage to get in here every year.. Amazing 
isn't it, but with the demise of ST Format, what are we going to do for 
next year.. Probably have to abolish this category altogether.. Anyway, 
Future get this one for their closure of 'Format with v.little warning, 
but then again, was anybody really *that* surprised??


Hero of the year..

Mike Kerslake, and by extension, the rest of the Atari Computing team 
for getting a brilliant new paper mag underway.. That includes us at 
Maggie as well to a certain extent, doesn't it!!


Villain of the Year..

No real ones here, just the usual range of Gatesean cardboard cut-out 
figures who deserve our pity as much as our contempt.. The real people 
on the Atari scene behaved really decently this year.. The Amiga 
worshipping food pillagers and parasites at Symposium might come close 
to a Maggie delivered thunderbolt though..

  
Competitor  Misfortune, most  hilarious..

**The curse of Commodore strikes again!!**

The Amiga's new owners, Escom, went bust this year!! Which unlucky 
unsuspecting sod is going to be next!!

 
Wires Crossed media cock-up of 1996!

This one was better/worse than average.. The Observer newspaper, an 
allegedly thoughtful and highbrow broadsheet newspaper got itself in a 
lot of poo by practically calling the director of Demon Internet, a 
child porn peddler..

A court case for libel is to follow, we'll keep you posted!


Better late than never..

The Aggression 'Motion' demo.. We will see it sometime soon??


Best Computer Show of 1996..

We had a choice between two events this year.. If we are to extend the 
definition of 'show' to include overseas coding conventions, then 
Symposium gets the vote.. If we are to stick with the traditional type 
of computer show, than the Autumn Atari Shows clearly take the cake 
home with them. One difference this year was our debut as exhibitors 
there..


The Hype falters..

The 'Year 2000 system clock bug'..

One which is three years early, but noteworthy right now for showing up 
the flakiness of certain parts of the competition.. The Falcon system 
clock recognises a change over at least from '99' to '00' without any 
trauma.. (I checked it) A respected television program showed Windows 
3.1 "handling" the same transition by switching from 11.59pm on the 
31st December 1999, to the original switch-on date for DOS, sometime in 
1980, when the new millenium was supposed to dawn!! The chap on the 
telly solemnly advised viewers at home "Not to try this at home" in 
case damage to data resulted.. Changes to newer versions of Windows and 
other PC applications software to overcome the bug are not thought to 
be ready before 1997, but in the meantime, the software companies are 
quite happy to go on churning out the old 'bugged' versions without 
giving any sort of warning!! Great, this commercial logic stuff!!


Summing it all, up, the word that best describes 1996..

For  a second,  no third year running, "Bollocks",  a word to fit  many 
occasions.. Still with years left in it!!

 (C) CiH  1996..
