                                 CONSOLE NEWS
                               BY LEON O'REILLY

Atari were right all along, consoles are the new rock'n'roll ((c) The 
Observer), unfortunately whilst the Playstation and Saturn  are the 
Oasises and Spice Girls of the gaming world, playing to packed  Wembley 
Stadiums and Royal Albert Halls, the Jaguar takes of  the  role  of  
indie  sadcore  losers  "Anal Cheer" and are currently playing down the 
local Arse&Trumpet  for  the princely sum of a packet of dry roast 
peanuts and a half of white lightning.

The success of  the  new  consoles  is  no  real  surprise,  companies  
with the financial muscle of Sega  and  Sony  rarely  get  it  wrong.  
Look at Microsoft, incapable of producing an even  half  decent  piece  
of software but yet totally dominating the market. What other company 
could possibly sponsor The Times for a day to ensure maximum coverage?

Where Sony have been clever is  to  promote  their machine in places 
not usually associated with  "video  games".  By  exposing  themselves  
in  music magazines, fashion magazines, nightclubs and festivals  they  
have managed to somewhat shed the anorak image from games and  also  
got  a  whole new group of people dipping into  their  pockets  for  
the  next  rendered-sequence  FMV  effort  posing  as entertainment.

The Jaguar could  never  have  beaten  these  new  consoles  even  if  
Atari had sacrificed Alistair Bodin in a Faustian  exchange  for 
success. I think that one of the key reasons that the Jaguar failed is 
that it was cartridge based, not CD based, because lets face it  
cartridges  are  bobbins.  So  bobbins in fact that Japanese breadheads 
had to invent  the  phrase  "megabits"  to make people think they were 
half decent. And what's more you, (the kids) believed them!

Cartridges are hampered by their  restricted  storage  space.  Sure, it 
is a lot more than your standard floppy, but  16-bit  colour graphics 
and 50khz sound eat memory for breakfast, and the size  of  Jag carts 
led inevitably to indigestion. There is no room for flashy FMV intros, 
for cute rendered sequences. We all know they are  bobbins,  pointless  
and  add  nothing  to  games,  but  they  do look impressive, 
especially in shops and they do help to sell systems.

Another masterstroke by Sony was getting  its  reportoire of artistes 
to compose music for their games. The Tempest 2000  soundtrack was 
excellent, but you can't really compete when Sony have Orbital,  
Underworld, The Chemical Brothers, Fluke and Daft Punk. On  the  same  
game!  Again  this  is  where the cartridge format suffers.

Atari's penny pinching cost them dear. By  not fitting a CD-ROM unit as 
standard on the Jag to keep  the  price  down,  they  found  the  cost 
of producing carts crippling. Pressing Jag carts cost around  ten  
pounds  each, whereas CDs can be copied for a tenth of this  sum.  
Atari  dealt  with  a lot of small third party developers who couldn't 
afford to press  up  the  cartridges - if the system had been CD based 
this wouldn't have been  a  problem. The profit margins on the CDs 
would have also been greater for all concerned thus attracting more 
developers.

Of course Atari did eventually bring out the CD, but by this time it 
was way too late. Even the biggest Jaguar  optimist  knew  it  had  a  
dark future. I am not against the Jag or the Jag-CD, I think it  would 
be great if every Jag owner had a CD and thus it would  be  well  worth  
small  developers pressing up their own games. It is just so  
frustrating  to  see  Atari  being  so close to, not world domination, 
just financial respectability and blowing it.

I get a strong feeling of deja vu when looking at the games scene at 
the moment. Titles are released on  three  main  formats,  two  of  the  
machines are at the cutting edge of technology, each  with  their  
relative merits and drawbacks and they both have fanatical followers. 
The third format is the weakest - yes that's still the  PC,  but  
instead  of  the  ST  and  Amiga  we  have  the  Saturn and 
Playstation.

If we are drawing parallels  between  the  consoles  and  the 16-bit 
machines, I would say that the Saturn is playing  the  role of the ST 
whilst the Playstation is the Amiga. The Playstation has  lots  of  
flashy  custom chips so you can get results out of it very quickly. The  
early playstation games looked a lot better than their Saturn 
counterparts, this is simply because the psx hardware is a lot easier 
to get to grips with. The Saturn is more of a hackers machine, more 
plain than the Playstation perhaps - lacking  its  Amiga-esque frills - 
but delivering more real power.

One of my friends from university now works for a subsidary of 
Psygnosis writing games on the Playstation. Sony have  a  monitoring 
system that gives a breakdown on machine performance and their  current  
3D  engine  uses 85% of the machine's graphic capacity and almost 100% 
of its mathematical capacity. He reckons he has now optimised the 
graphics part so it uses another 5-10%.

The point is that people are already  reaching the limits of the 
Playstation. It has already been pushed as far as it  can  go.  Think 
how long it took people to reach the limits of the ST - I  estimate  5  
years. It has taken just 2 with the Playstation.

Interestingly enough, while my the Psygnosis guy thinks that the 
Playstation has already "shot its bolt" he  thinks  that  the  Saturn  
has not yet achieved full orgasm. Sega's hardware has  still  a  lot  
more  to  offer,  its just that most companies can't be asked to 
exploit it. They have their libraries set up and just port things 
between machines without exploiting their full capabilities.

It must be unusual for an article  to  ramble (so aimlessly!) about 
consoles for so long without mentioning the N  word.  The  Ultra-64 
(crazy name, crazy guys!) will be with us on March 1st, although  it  
would have probably been more apt if they release it a month later. The 
U64  will  be a flop. You heard it here first folks!

Obviously it won't be a flop in the Jaguar way of limping around for 
three years before finally deciding to "get its  coat".  The  U64 will 
be a glorious, media- shagging, multi-million dollar burning  corporate  
catastrophe  of a failure. In Japan it will be a big success,  and  the 
Americans will love it (although these are the same people who thought  
an  ex-b  film actor who couldn't even remember his own name was their 
greatest ever leader) but Europe will snub it.

The Playstation and Saturn have already established a massive userbase. 
Whilst a lot of the Sega heads went for the Saturn, Super NES people 
tired of waiting for their company's new offering plumped for the 
Playstation.

I don't know much about the U-64s tech  specs. It is probably more 
powerful than the currently available consoles,  but  not  
_significantly_  more powerful, not enough to prise people away from 
their  Playstations.  It is too late, the first (and most important) 
battle has been  fought.  It  seems  at the moment that the Playstation 
was the victor in this by a  small margin. It appears that Atari are 
not the only company who have problems with punctuality.

One of the key problems with the U64  is  that it is cartridge based. 
This means it has the problems of the  Jag:  limited  storage and high 
manufacturing costs. There will not be the space  for  lots  of  FMV  
and CD quality soundtracks a la Wipeoout. This may be a good  thing  as  
gameplay  will become the main focus of attention.

The cartridges are very expensive  to  produce  and  Nintendo  are 
taking a huge royalty on each sale. This has put  off  most  developers  
- in fact there are a pitfully small amount  of  companies  working  on  
U64  games.  It  is  just not financially viable for  small  
developers,  and  even  the  large  ones  have no inclination to work 
on a platform  that  will  bring  them less revenue than the highly 
successful Saturn and Playstation.

Nintendo has just about admitted that it doesn't  expect the U64 to be 
a success in Europe. It will be an enormous hit  in Japan, obviously, 
and will probably do well in the USA. But over here  it  will  probably 
be as popular as the Neo-Geo. Lets face it, who is going to want to pay 
almost 100 pounds for a game?

The success of the consoles reflects  badly  on the PC. Although many 
households have a brand new shiny high powered  pentium  with CD-ROM, 
16 meg of memory etc. And yet they still  go  out  and  buy  consoles  
to  play  games.  The fact that companies are still introducing new  
consoles  and  producing such a quantity of console games shows that 
the  PC  is  still  not  a  good platform for games. It certainly 
hasn't captured that market in  the  way  the  ST and Amiga did in the 
early 90s. People don't have confidence in the PC's ability to handle 
games.

Consoles have much shorter life expectancy  these  days. Whilst the 
Megadrive and SNES hung around for years, the  future  for  the Saturn 
and Playstation doesn't look so  bright.  According  to  my  mole  at  
the  Psygnosis  subsidary,  their development team are working on a 
maximum  of  4 more Playstation games and then they will move onto 
other format.  He  believes  that next christmas will be the last big 
christmas for the Playstation, and  after that it will be downhill with 
less titles being produced and companies moving to different formats. 
There is a Playstation 2 which, you will be  pleased  to  know,  is not 
compatible with the original Playstation. So all  the  effort  put  
into  forcing  developers to use operating system calls "for future 
compatibility" was futile.

Because consoles are not around for so long,  they don't get the chance 
to build up a decent body of software. The early releases concentrate 
on producing flashy effects and getting as much out  of  the  hardware 
as possible. The best looking releases inevitably sell the most. After  
two  years or so, once the programmers have learned the hardware inside 
out  and  can  actually sit down and write some decent, innovative 
games it is time to move  onto the next format. How many good looking  
and  technically  impressive  games   are   there  on  the  Saturn  and 
Playstation? Many.  How  many  good,  playable  games  are  there  on  
these new machines? Very few, and it is doubtful that  there  will ever 
be as large a body of decent games as machines like the  SNES,  
Megadrive and even ST and Amiga can boast. Because of the  rapid  
increases  in  technology,  the  consoles will die before the 
developers can create that amount of good games.

So although they appear to be  flying  high  now, the Playstation and 
Saturn are already dying. They have been  bought  by  a  "trendy  young 
market" who are not likely to display any  brand  loyalty,  and  when  
the  next  "must buy console" appears,  car  boot  sales  will  be   
overflowing  with  unwanted  Saturns  and Playstations.

Those of you who are  depressed  that  you  cannot  afford to pay the 
ridiculous prices for games on these new machines  can console yourself 
in knowing that the machine you are currently on has the  capacity  to 
be more far more entertaining than any console. And even the  Atari  ST  
scene  will still be going long after Sony and Sega's machines have 
passed into history.
