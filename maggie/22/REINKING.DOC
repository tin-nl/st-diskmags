Dot matrix printers  are  probably  the  most  common  type  of home 
printers. Reasonably fast, very  cheap  and  infinitely  flexible,  
they're  perfect for banging out the odd letter, list or graphic, if 
you're not too concerned about quality.

Unfortunately, they also eat ribbons  like  there's  no tomorrow.  A 
couple of screen dumps and a lengthy letter  later  and the printer 
output's greyer than John Major. So you have two choices:

a) Splash out  4 for a new ribbon
b) Re-ink the sod

More and more people are choosing  b).  Re-inking sprays are readily 
available from many mail-order outfits, from around  12.  Not cheap, 
but after three re- inks, they've paid for themselves.

I've only seen two types  of  spray;  Ribbon  Refresh (originally from 
Caspell Computers of Poole) and Re-ink (I got mine from Trilogic, but 
you can get then from most good traders). Ribbon  Refresh  is  a 
aerosol-based device, with all those nasty CFC's that everyone's  is  
telling you about. Another disadvantage is that its not ink off  your  
fingers  for  weeks (don't wear your best shirt whilst using this 
stuff).  A tin of  Ribbon  Refresh  will last you for a good 100 re-
inks; I had my tin for  3  years  before it ran out...  The ink quality 
was OK, black enough for most purposes.

"Re-ink" seems a much better buy  to  me.  Its a pump-action dispenser, 
making it much more controllable (the ink  goes  more  or  less where 
you want it to) and, of course, environmentally  favourable.   Being  
more  or  less 100% ink, printers come out much blacker using Re-ink -  
I  found I had to use only half as much to get the same effect as 
Ribbon Refresh.

Of course, there  are  many  legends  to  ribbon  re-inking.   Tales of 
people squirting WD40 into the case and ending up  with  a new ribbon 
are told to the awe of new users.  People have been  known  to try 
everything from shoe polish and dyes to Indian Ink in their quest for  
a new ribbon.  But the sad truth of the matter is that, not only will 
these remedies not work, you'll knacker your printer in the process. 
The pins in the printhead are manufactured to within a fraction of a 
millimetre and jamming it  up  with all kinds of crud just won't do it 
any good.  Re-inking sprays have special lubricants designed to stop 
the pins jamming and can actually prolong the  life  of your printer.  
So don't be mean; either buy a new ribbon, or a  spray,  but stay away 
from that bottle of Quink that you've got in that writing desk...

Now, here comes the tricky bit - actually re-inking the ribbon. "Easy", 
I hear you cry, but  there  is  a  definite  knack  to  re-inking.   
Follow the steps below...

1) First of all, find a flat, hard surface  for you to work on.  Don't 
try and re-ink a ribbon whilst its still in the printer, and balancing 
it on your knee is out too.

2) Cover the work area with old newspapers (or Amiga Formats if you're 
feeling nasty).  I mean COVER the place;  every  nook,  cranny  and 
corner needs to be protected from the ink. Remember Murphy's 2nd  Law  
- If several things can go wrong, the one which will cause the most 
damage will be the first.

3) Now, lay the ribbon cassette on the newspapers, and lift the lid off 
with a screwdriver.  Take it easy, easing each corner up  a little at a 
time.  If you try to lift the whole thing  off  in  one,  you'll  end 
up breaking the little plastic pegs which hold the thing together.  New 
ribbon time!

4) Spraying time.  Don't go mad,  just  a  quick  blast  over the whole 
of the ribbon.  It'll probably have a guide to  how  many sprays you 
need on the back of the can; IGNORE IT.  These figures are usually way 
too high, probably in an attempt to get you to use more  of  the  
stuff.  If this is your first re-ink, just make sure you've covered all 
of the  ribbon and no more.  It may not look soaked, but it doesn't 
have to be.  A little goes a long way...

5) Now leave the ribbon alone and go and  wash your hands (I told you, 
it goes everywhere).  Don't try and use the ribbon  straight away, 
you'll just get ink all over the rubber roller. Leave the ribbon (with 
the lid off) in a cool, dry place (an airing cupboard is ideal) on  a  
piece of kitchen roll or something. DON'T stick it on top of a boiler, 
in the oven or under a lamp to make it dry; it'll just clog the whole 
thing up  and  you'll have to start again.  Its best to leave a wet 
ribbon at least overnight,  and you really shouldn't use it for at 
least another 24 hours.

6) Now try the ribbon in your printer.  Get  a  piece of paper and run 
a self- test.  If all you get is a continuous  line  of ink, you've 
used far too much. Open the ribbon up again (with all  the  newspapers 
etc.) and use a cotton bud to mop up some of the ink.  Now leave  it  
for at least 48 hours and don't use so much ink next time.  If the  
self-  test  produces print that is just a bit blurred and splodgy, 
you're almost there.   Run  the self-test over and over a few times to 
burn off some  of  that  ink.   Some printers (Star LC-10's etc.) have 
a hidden feature that  just  runs  the  print  cartridge  up and down 
the length of the printer (on an LC-  10,  hold down on-line, paper 
feed and print pitch during power-on).  This helps to  spread  the  ink 
out a little. After a few minutes of this and a few  more self-tests, 
the print should be acceptably clean.

7) If you are still getting  blobs  of  ink over your printouts, try 
adjusting the print gap (i.e. the distance between the printhead and 
the paper). If this doesn't work, take the lid off, and stick it back 
in the cupboard for a day or so.  There's NOTHING you can do to  speed  
up the ink-drying process, so don't try (I have and paid the price!)

Hopefully, all will go well and  you  will  enjoy  crisp, black 
printing for a fraction of the cost.  Keep doing this, and one ribbon 
can last you for years. I managed to keep  the  same  ribbon  for  3  
years,  before it disintegrated. Perhaps this is a little over the top,  
but  it just shows how stingy we Scots are!
