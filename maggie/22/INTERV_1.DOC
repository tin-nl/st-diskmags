Interview with Data of TRIO  
  
> - Hello Data!
  - Hello guys and to everybody who reads this.

> - Please tell me Your real name (I know of, but maybe our readers not)  
    age...
 - My real name is Patrice MANDIN, I am 23 years old. I am 1.70 meters    
   tall.I am dark haired too.I have two legs and two arms, but only one 
   head.

> - How long do you own F030 ???

- I have my own Falcon 030 from February 1994. I waited one year after 
it was  available to see what it became, and what it really could bring 
me  more than the STE -\ 
                       | 
                      \|/
> - Do you have other computer except Falcon ???

- I have a 520STE, 1Meg upgraded (useful for coding). I really started 
to code  ASM with it, because I wanted to make games & demos. And 
before the STE, I  had an Amstrad CPC 6128, on which I started to code 
in BASIC (great language!)  and a little in Z80 ASM.

> - What done Trio ??? (Except 124 beers demo - c0oL nAmE !!!)

- Except this demo I made during a party, TRIO actually does nothing 
special.  I am the most working coder (I am modest...). If there is a 
party in France  this summer 1996, I would like to make a new demo.

> - I heard about Your game which is a clone of Doom. What was Your 
motivation to do this PC game ??? 

- On Falcon, there are very few games, not because the machine, but the 
low market. I think it was a good idea to make games for the Falcon, as 
it would be   easier than the Intel/Microsoft machines. So the best way 
to do a good game   on Falcon, was to take a good PC game and try to 
make it on Falcon. The other   main reason was that the more I played 
DOOM on PC, the more I said me that it   could be possible to make the 
game, as it runs well on a 386-33.

> - When we see full version of this game ???

- When it will be finished I think. :-)  Really, I don't know, as there 
are others people who try to make DOOM on Fal-  con. Especially the BAD 
MOOD team, with Doug Little as 3D coder (he is APEX   MEDIA coder!). 
It's a nice challenge to make a better,faster version than the   
others. At this moment, my version is more complete (full real 
textures, PC-  like command line), but his is faster. So let's continue 
the fight between us.   I think that if you want it, you make it.

> - What you think about Falcon situation in France ??? 

- The Falcon market in France, in my opinion, is nearly the same as the 
Amiga.  I mean these machines occupy small niches, where PCs and MACs 
are not the  best. I mean music market for the Falcon, and video market 
for the Amiga.  The main problem is that Atari don't support no more 
its computer, so why  new users would bought one ? This may change with 
C-LAB, Medusa, and others  but who knows. 

> - What you want see more on the falcon (demos/games/tools/zines) ???

- The Falcon community must enlarge, and the best way is to spread 
information  to all users. 

   Magazines are a good way to spread information coming from outer  
countries, when you don't have access to Internet. 

   Demos are now a little "decadent" I think, because what is the  
purpose to display flashing colors or rotating pictures on a screen,  
when you can watch a FMV movie on the multimedia PC near you ? I like  
demos, but they have to show something new : a message I think, like  
some video-clips. 

   Games are a good way to make something that others people can  
appreciate, except PC-people ("Where is the FMV ?","The GFX are not  
3DStudio ones so they are bad"). 

   Tools are the most useful ones (so they are called "utilities") 
because  with tools, you can display faster (NVDI), you can copy faster 
(Kobold)  you can play faster (my DOOM don't have the 10 seconds start 
it needs on  PC). So you can do the same things as on a PC, faster if 
you have the  right tool

Glossary : FMV = Full Motion Video, as on TV it means               
PC  = Poor Computer (you need hardware upgrade to play games)

> - At the end maybe some words to our readers ???

- great, Falcon, machine, code, stay cool, :-), Windows 95 is old, 
Linux is   better

> - Thanks for interview. Stay cool!

- You too, folks, see you soon when everybody will be on Internet.
