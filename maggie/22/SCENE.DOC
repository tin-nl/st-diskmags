…What about the 'Scene' then? 
Some reflections from a Maggie perspective..

„In his interview, we asked Richard Karsmakers the following question..

> What do you think of the Atari scene in general??

„To which, he replied..

With the risk of sounding sentimental, the scene the way it was  when 
Stefan and I did the "ST NEWS International Christmas Coding  
Convention" in December 1990.  This  was the coolest, friendliest, 
weirdest, most talented and craziest scene I've ever seen. Even  though 
I was never a programmer, I was proud to be part of it in  some 
insignificant, fleeting way. Things won't be like that,  never again, 
certainly not on the PC. People like TCB's Nic and  Tanis, TLB's 
Manikin, those crazy Frenchies of Overlanders and ST  Connexion, and 
those absurdly talented people like TEX' Mad Max, ES  and -me-, they 
were the icing that made the scene a great one.  Obliterating borders, 
sync scrolling, getting good sound of the  crappy YM 2149 chip...those 
were the days. 

Today, the scene is one  that I can hardly identify with. Too many 
Germans, too many  Frenchies, a lack of cool friendship (TCB <> TLB 
comes to mind),  no sense of humour, too much house music, and parties 
that, from  what I've read and heard, are just too big, not cosy. I 
have  basked in the glow of coding gods, and with me a great multitude  
of others. Nic, in my eyes, was the best coder ever. The day he  left 
the old scene, it died.

„What an ol' misery guts Karsmakers can be sometimes! perhaps its a 
little too much of the 'ST News final issue blues' still permeating his 
tapwater, but its something of a pity that Richard K. sees things that 
way.. Our own experiences would still seem to indicate there is 
something, indeed, quite a lot of the old Atari spirit out there even 
in this otherwise grey and PC dominated world..

Demo coders and their peculiar ways to start with..

From a Symposium point of view, yes, the party was too big and cold, 
but the Atari people had their own distinctive area in which they could 
congregate, and boy, was it the most friendly place in the whole 
building.. It might have been something to do with the fact that we got 
adequate supplies of daylight, whilst the rest sat in continual semi-
darkness, but Atari people were willing to talk, to show off what they 
were doing, and to behave like decent human beings.. Germans were 
there, the Dutch made their presence felt too, the Swedes were there, 
and they were cool, the solitary Frenchman at the event (Arto) has 
stayed in contact with us since.. 

Contrast that with the Amiga and PC people who even refused to talk to 
each other, let alone accept a first contact from a complete stranger.. 
Richard K. was certainly right in that you don't get so friendly a 
scene anywhere else.. This still holds good even now..

There's more to the Atari scene than just one collection of people at a 
particular time. Sure, we miss the old crews such as TEX, TCB and The 
Lost Boys, but things move on, and the Falcon scene is at least, as 
creative and as much fun as those olden days were..

If we widen the definition of 'scene' from the narrow and specific 
description of demo coders, this takes in a lot more people, such as 
the people writing for Dave Hollis's diskmag, ST+.. Most of these, I 
would never have known of otherwise, and a defining moment for making 
contact with many of them was at the recent Autumn Atari Shows, which 
displayed classy computers and also had the company of many pleasurable 
like-minded people..   

Our definition of 'scene' also takes in such People as System Solutions 
and Titan designs, still some of the most talented people at work on 
Atari, the people at Atari Computing Magazine, the folks behind the 
Wessex Atari Group and 42 BBS, not to mention all our own people who 
can be gathered under the dubious collective known as the Maggie Team.. 
There are many other people and groups out there we have not mentioned 
yet..

Conclusion:- It still seems wherever a few people with Atari's get 
together, a pretty good time can be had by all!!
