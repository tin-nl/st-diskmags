                THE WORLDS FASTEST GROWING ST 'ZINE *
 
                 Hi there, welcome to ST+ 'the advert'.

Well, you know  what diskzines  are all about so why not write in NOW  
for  the  latest issue,  all I  ask is  that you  submit something for  
inclusion  in  ST+, you  can  send in  either a  review of software or  
hardware  or  ANYTHING YOU  LIKE!!, alternatively  you can submit that  
picture you created once whilst bored one night,  whatever you want to  
send in feel free to do so but please, ST+ IS submissionware so if you  
want a copy either:-

1,  Send  me your submissions (along with a DD disk and  an  S.S.A.E.)  
to the following address.....
ST+ 
43 Spenfield Court 
Lings 
Northampton 
NN3 8LZ 
ENGLAND

...or request your copy from your PDL, if it's not there try GOODMANS,  
L.A.P.D or Prophecy PDL.
 
Before you write off a little about ST+...coz we ARE different..
 
                               ABOUT US.. 
                               ----------

The main aim of ST+ is to appeal to beginners and experts alike,  NO- 
ONE is discriminated against because of their lack of knowledge, after  
all,  we all have to start somewhere,  besides,  I've had my ST for  a  
number of years and I'm still learning.

The secondary aim of ST+ is to incorporate new AND old articles, just  
because  something  was  published a few years  ago  it  doesn't  mean  
everyone has seen it and believe me, there are some excellent articles  
that  will  NEVER be out of date,  I like to think  that  every  Atari  
machine deserves a place in ST+,  be it Falcon,  ST,  Jaguar or  Lynx,  
even  the lowly Atari 2600 will alway's find room on the disk  (should  
anyone choose to send in any 2600 related articles).

Aside from all the technical aspects of ST+ you will also find a wide  
range  of topics that freely invite your contributions,  are you  into  
Sci-Fi,  well,  Peter Augustin,  our resident Sci-Fi buff has his  own   
dedicated  section within the pages of ST+,  into music,  no  problem,  
your catered for also, in fact  something is  not covered in  ST+ just  
let us know and we'll sort something out....we LISTEN to our readers.
For those of you who are 'worried'  that  ST+ might be  a  little  to  
'serious'  you might like to know what lies ahead for you  should  you  
choose to send of for ST+....

ST NEWS currently said of us:

'Article-wise,  "ST+" covers the wide ground between STOS and Jaguar,  
Lynx and Machine code,  games reviews and music/MIDI, demo reviews and  
humour bits.  An interesting blend,  though never with too much  depth  
either'.

....so there you have it,  proof (as if it were needed) that ST+  does  
indeed  cater  for  all  as  well as making  this  easy  to  read  and  
understand.
 
                              MULTI-MEDIA 
                              -----------
 Have  you ever wondered what the editor of  your  favourite diskzine  
looks like?,  well,  ST+ is the ONLY diskzine (that I'm aware of) that  
incorporates  pictures into it's text (and I don't mean ASCII  artwork  
either),  this  means your not limited to reading endless  text  files  
that  strain your eye's,  only with ST+ can you SEE what your  reading  
about without having to exit the text viewer to see 'A' picture.....
 
                         COMMERCIAL ADVERTISERS 
                         ----------------------
Now, with the  demise of  ST Format where  are you  going to find out  
about  all the latest goings on in  the Atari world,  how are the  the  
likes of Analogic computers and Alien Technoligies going to  advertise  
their products....ST+,  that's where,  yes, it's true, ST+ is the ONLY  
diskmagazine that contains adverts from MAJOR Atari  dealers,  special  
offers exclusive to ST+ are plentiful...what more could you want...
 
                        THE WORLD IS OUR OYSTER 
                        -----------------------
 What about an international flavour,  ST+ also boasts a  world  wide  
audience  from  the  U.S.A.  to  Austalia through  to  Italy  and  the  
Netherlands,  not bad but then we are up to issue 9, now you know were  
not a fly by night outfit why not send us that blank disk and S.S.A.E.  
now, you've nothing to loose.

 There is so much to ST+ it would take around 700k to explain it  all  
to you, coincidentally that's just about the same amount of disk space  
that each issue takes up so what better than to request your copy  now  
and see for yourself but remember, ST+ is submissionware..... 

                  I look forward to hearing from you 

                              Dave Hollis. 

                          Editor ST+ diskzine. 
                           ST+  D.Hollis '96
