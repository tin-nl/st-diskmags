ÖThe Gus Spank ST Tips/PG Tips page.. 
Ö
Hiya all, Gus Spank back yet again in a more lighthearted look at the 
host of useful and brilliant suggestions to make life computing on your 
ST a lot easier than it is now. People who are unable to cope with 
life-enhancing, useful and commonsense advice, stop reading right here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we kick off with this issues ST tips, let me remind you that you 
can win a bag of PG Tips finest tea if you wish to contribute with your 
own entries. Yes, PG Tips, so successful and outstanding, they are able 
to fund research in twenty years worth of chimpanzees emulating human 
behaviour well and truly adapted to cope with a typical late millenium 
suburban domestic setting. What scientific wonders will they come up 
with next, perhaps a crate of jellied eels, all with literature 
degreees from Cambridge University perhaps? We wonder in an awestruck 
fashion.

Without further ado, and on with your coat! As the ringmaster might 
say.

Å1. How to get rid of those annoying white borders on your ST

The method is not actually anything to do with the infamous ST Format 
suggestion that you throw your ST off a railway bridge and go and buy 
an Amiga instead. Simply get hold of loads of bluetack, or papier mache 
for those of you working to a low budget, and crinkle as much of the 
substance as possible, sticking it to the offending white areas on your 
screen. Hey presto, white border blues banished!!

Å2. How to do 'Tekken' on your ST

Now many of you will have rich mates who own Sony Playstations, the 
sort of mates who used to own Amigas before the big software houses 
dropped that tragic format and now have got the latest 'in-thing' 
instead, indeed the sort of people who started last football season 
supporting Newcastle United, but seeing which way the wind was blowing 
Premiership title race wise, switched allegiences to Manchester United 
instead. Now these bandwagon jumpers, these whores of convenience 
should all be killed and lightly poached, but as it is, they do have 
access to some pretty top notch looking wares on the OverratedStation, 
and 'Tekken' is one such game, a classic that you are never likely to 
see on your humble ST.

Or are you?

Bring a camcorder to the next session of ego-boosting (his) and 
humilation (yours) with the GreedStation that he has organised. Get him 
to put Tekken on for a very long time as people with consoles have very 
little else to do with their tiny and pointless lives, and have spent a 
long time perfecting their 'moves' on a single game. Try to get him to 
play through *all* the game if possible, recording it as you go with 
the camcorder.

Once you get home, the next stage is down to you, as a suitable video 
digitiser (anything from VideoMaster upwards will do) and a blummin' 
big hard drive are the next tools in this little tale. Now don't whinge 
as hard drive prices are coming down all the time, and anyway, a lot of 
the data will reduce itself when downgraded down to the sixteen colours 
or greyscales that the ST can handle. A good eye for video sequence 
editing and a lot of strong hot cups of black coffee are also a good 
idea for this editing marathon. By the end of it all, you should have 
Tekken cut into little strips of movie sequences for each individual 
character and action, including all the special moves, if the low life 
with the original article has been especially diligent.

The next bit is a piece of piss by comparison, as all you need to do is 
to write a simple control program linked to your joystick (or better 
still, Jaguar Powerpad for STe and up) to call up the sequences as they 
are needed by simple button presses and control movements (STOS will do 
nicely!) A large part of the game is pre-calculated anyway, and does 
not even need that much effort.

Et Voila, Tekken a la ST!!

You could go one step further and get the hard drive 'burned to CD-ROM, 
I believe System Solutions offer such a service, and have a version of 
'Tekken' for your ST that will be the envy of your previously scornful 
and unimaginative Playstation owning buddies!!

You are also now ready to enter into your new career as a commercial 
level multimedia interactive playware developer and publisher, and 
don't forget those corporate lawyers!

(Unique Developments note:- Why not promise an 'enhanced' version for 
the Falcon using the superior 'Expose' Digitiser for a more authentic 
reproduction of the original, but forget to release it!)

Å3. How to cope if your Jody Smith is writing in a sane and 
straightforward manner

Now my friend Dave who owns a diskmag of his own has a few suggestions 
here. He acquired the use of a good secondhand Jody Smith recently and 
all was fine for two or three issues. However, it appeared that Dave 
had been sold a lemon as his Jody Smith started to come up with pieces 
that looked as if they were better in the lead pages of the Economist 
magazine, a publication not noted for wackiness on any sort of scale. 

Now Dave went through several homespun remedies, from the jar of 
vinegar and hairshirt treatment, through to the submerged honey bath 
massage dip, but none of these made any impression on the problem. Dave 
finally hit on a solution when he made Jody inhale the fumes from 
several boiled up copies of 'Eezi-PC'. Dave knew he was finally getting 
through when Jody screamed 'What's the point of it all!" and started 
again on writing the famously brilliant wibble for which he is rightly 
revered. Other approaches have been suggested, but we would take the 
opportunity to repudiate the idea of forcing Jody to read the copies of 
Eezi-PC as such concentrated doses of toxicity might well prove fatal 
to the poor lamb.

Å4. That's all for this time

Well readers, I've enjoyed my new role in Maggie as a kind of 
dangerously misinformed 'Help Guru' and hope to bring some more 'top 
tips' for next time. If you have any potentially prizewinning 'PG Tips' 
for the postbag, then feel free to write in to the Maggie 
Correspondence address.

BNye!
