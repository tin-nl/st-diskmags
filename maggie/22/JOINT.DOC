                              JOINT VENTURE
                            BY THE INDEPENDENT

At last, the demo you have all been  waiting  for  - the staff of one 
of England top national broadsheets go on  a  search  for  'jazz' 
cigarettes with "hilarous consequences.

Or perhaps not, as Joint Venture (crazy  name, crazy guys!) simply 
refers to the fact that a lot of different people contributed to the 
creation of this demo. It is akin to calling a music  compilation 
"VARIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS". Fortunately the actual demo is much more 
inspiring than the  name, but this is usually the case. It has been 
mathematically proved that  the  quality  of the demo  is  inversely 
proportional to that of the title. A  demo  called something like "Some 
stuff we knocked up last thursday after an extended  session  at the 
arse & trumpet" will consist of draw dropping effects, a  DSP  
overheating  3D world and a sublime 32 channel module. A demo with  a  
name  like  "Destruction  Of The Universe" will, inevitably, consist of 
some shadebobs.

Joint Venture has unique start - at  least  on my machine. It drops you 
straight back to the desktop. Just as  you  are  beginning  to curse 
the internet and the quality of floppy disk these days, GEM fades down 
and logo appears informing you that your Falcon is currently in the  
process of "starting a joint venture". You rub your hands in glee, run  
off  don  your  slippers and dressing-gown, dim the lights, light your 
pipe and settle back into your armchair.

"Der-dah-der-dah-der" Unfortunately Stax's tunes  don't  convert into 
ascii very well. But suffice his Joint Venture  soundtrack  is another 
absolute corker. The bastard! Why can't he make one bad  tune!  This  
one has all the essentials that make the french speaking Austrian such  
a  maestro  - rollicking breaks and some great 303 style acid 
squiggles.

The logo falls away as white squares,  an  effect  that also appears in 
an early Fried Bits intro screen.

We are launched  headlong  into  a  3D  starfield.  As  well  as  
containing the conventional dots it also  features  some  planets  
which  appear as big sprites whose surfaces appear to rotate as  they  
whizz  past  your head. This is a good twist on the  hoary  old  
chestnut  that  is  the  starfield  effect  and a good introduction 
into the demo.

A mysterious white line appears  on  the  screen.  (Gallagher! Keep 
quiet at the back!). A joint venture logo then blurs  across  this onto 
the screen. This is a very nice effect  and  reminds  me  slightly  of  
a  logo  averaging effect that appeared on an early version of Double 
Bobble.

We continue with a full screen of wibbly colours with another joint 
venture logo in the centre. With a flash the  wibbly  colours start to, 
well, wibble! This is the "FOG" effect (cough!) and looks ace. 
Especially nice is the way that colours appear to bleed into each 
other. The only disconcerting feature is that it looks nothing like 
fog, in fact it isn't a  fog  effect at all but a heat haze effect. 
Amazingly some German people who put  this  demo  together  thought it 
was a fog effect! No wonder they lost the war! No,  only joking! Joke, 
you know humour? No you wouldn't...I'll get my coat!

Fact fans -  this heat haze effect was  actually the brainchild of 
Ripley of the Reservoir  Gods  who  suggested  the  idea  to  Tat  
after  the  Reservoir  Gods convention. He then coded the  effect,  
originally  it  featured a digital chaos logo drawn by SH3/RG. He gave 
it  to  absence  at the Symposium for inclusion in their demo, which 
was supposed to be released there. So that is the story of the "fog" 
effect - I hope that has de-mist-ified things. (You're sacked. Jokes 
Ed)

To traverse the triumverate of tunnels.

First up is a tunnel by TSCC. This goes for the "spinny plasma" look 
rather than the "flying through it" look. This  is  also a rather 
temperamental effect, most of the time it runs fine on my machine  but 
ever now and then it will jerk quite horribly. Perhaps this is 
something to do with the interrupt loader?

A great picture is coloured onto  the  screen.  This  has some sort of 
stage and features a grotesque  singer.  The  interesting  thing  about  
the  image is the texture of the colouring, it looks more  like  a 
painting than a computer image. It was painted by Bull of Absence and  
a  fine job he did too. To paraphrase Mr. Public, I don't know much 
about art but I like this!

Another tunnel effect.  This  is  a  fast  moving  rush  through  a  
tunnel with interesting synthetic colouring. The tunnel  seems  to  
scroll about which makes the effect more hectic.

That Bull picture is back!

Another tunnel effect appears. I am beginning to empathise with 
creatures in the mole family. This time it is  yellow  with  depth  
shading  and moves along in a snake like fashion. It is more 
"realistic" than  the first one, but not quite so colourful. The screen 
is set  into  some  ridiculous  resolution, you can always tell by the 
squeal of disconcertion my monitors gives.

It is now time  to  "get  down"  with  some  old-skool  rasters!  Yes, 
I did say "rasters". Some horizontal blue rasters and vertical green 
rasters. One hardware scrolls whilst the other is overlayed. I  wonder  
if in the future there will be raster wallpaper which features a 
sinewave  distortion? Then you could just look at your wall instead of 
watching screens  like  this.  In fact my walls are bare but they are 
still more fun to watch than this effect.

Imagine the biggest screen resolution ever. I don't mean the most 
pixels, I mean the one that  fills  up  more  of  your  monitor  than  
you thought machinically possible. Well let me introduce you to the big 
swirly circle screen and its vast appetite for screen space.

The big swirly circle screen(TM) features a  large big swirly circle 
thing which occupies the entire screen.  Some  colours  swirl  around  
it, then some ripples appear adding further displacement. Everything 
moves  about  a bit more, and you scratch your head and wonder what the  
point  of  this effect is. It is odd that most demo effects you take 
for granted  and  don't question, but this one always begs  the  
question  "what?".  Perhaps  it  is  best  viewed  with  the  aid  of 
hallucinogenic drugs, but unfortunately I only  had  Devon Florals to 
hand which really don't quite have the same effect.

An amazing picture new appears with  an  incredible background full of 
(I'll use that word again) swirly colours. Standing over  this is a 
startled looking young woman and the text "reality.sys corrupted.  
Rebooting universe". This is more of a PC joke as we don't need all 
those silly sys files telling our machine what to do. "reality.tos" 
doesn't sound quite so good though.

I must mention the fade down as it  is  a bit poor. It uses the 
aggression trick of hardware fading (Which I explainged in  a recent 
issue of Maggie) that always creates a horrible white raster bar  at  
the  top  of my screen. Plus it doesn't fade the screen all the way 
down - on  a  bright TV or monitor you can still see the image. Then 
you see it slowly being cleared!

The next effect is a sad reminder of  what could have been. Lazer had 
worked for nearly a year on a new demo  based  around  the  theme of 
animals and nature but Photon somehow managed to wipe his hard-drive  
and lose his dsp 3D world system. This effect was coded by  Energizer  
for  the  demo.  It  is  a water effect and features some graphics of a 
naked young lady lying  by the pool. As it is all in double line mode, 
she looks rather hideous. As  to the effect itself, it is good to see 
something original, although  perhaps  it  is  not very exciting. This 
is always a dilemna. You can come with a  totally  off the wall idea 
for an effect, but are people going to be excited by it?  I think at 
least 50% of that can come down to presentation and unfortunately this 
demo isn't that well designed.

We now have the final greets and credits screen. A strange looking 
creature with a shaking wobbles about at the bottom of the screen 
whilst some text is faded in and out at the top. This is the end of the 
demo.

The main problem with joint venture is  with  the  design. This demo is 
really a collection of effects from different crews  that  really 
should have appeared in their own demos. I suppose it is like the 
difference between a compilation album and an album by a  single  
artists.  Compilations often lack cohesion, direction and a theme.

The effects themselves are excellent,  and  come  from  the  top class 
of Falcon coders. The graphics are also  fantastic  especially  the  
two still images, and Stax's tune is as brilliant as always.  But  it 
is lacking presentation wise. If only something as simple as linking 
effects  to the music (probably difficult to do with other peoples 
code) it  would  have  improved  things. And, good as they are, did we 
really need 3 tunnel effects? No 3D, but instead rasters?

Despite these gripes "Joint Venture"  is  still  a  very good demo, 
possibly the best demo released in 1996. It also  highlights  the 
talents of The Innovator, a man who contributed a lot to the  atari  
scene and perhaps didn't get the credit he deserved. The Innovator was  
never  name  checked  in  the same way as lesser coders in French and  
German  crews,  but  his  efforts  of  demos like this and "Terrorise 
Your Soul" were nothing short  of  astonishing.  He will be missed by 
all on the Falcon scene.
 
Joint Venture
TECH VIEW: Mostly glued together during the Symposium '96 this is  
another "get rid of the back catalogue" effort. Nothing awesome (most  
bits are very old) and no DSP or "real" 3D again. 

Technical highlights are the bendy vector tunnel by TSCC, despite it  
being a bit small, and the design parts which show a fair bit of  
originality. 

Lowlight is the crummy fog-distorter-heat-haze bit, done by yours  
truly (great idea though thanks Ripley) Oh, and the entire demo works  
off an interrupt to do that logo over the desktop. Bonkers. [tat]
