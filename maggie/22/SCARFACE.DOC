ÅS c a r f a c e  
'Most Wanted' Demo

This not inconsiderable effort which falls within the 'very large 
dentro' or 'megademo' class, recently came from the hands of various 
French people in a hitherto unheard of combination called Scarface.. 
One pretty famous name in there is an individual called Nullos, thought 
to have left DNT and the Falcon..  Some of his work, particularly in 
the second part of the demo is in here though, so tales of his deadness 
can be ruled out, at least for the moment..

Starting it up is an exercise in defying strangeness, as there are 
three .prg files in the folder, but only the middle one actually leads 
to success.. It is usually a good idea to keep as much memory to one 
side as possible as well.. However, from there, it is all 
straightforward and rather enjoyable..

The first bit is a fairly standard logo procession, including one which 
tells you where the demo was first released (Place to Be Convention, 
from memory..) At the same time, a funky guitar based soundtrack kicks 
in, and shopping mall security guards all over the world suddenly rush 
across the aisle, kicking over carefully pre-placed cardboard boxes in 
a frenzy of Starsky and Hutch-mania in time to this soundtrack (See 
Maggie 19 'In the Trashcan' if you can't work out what I'm on about..)

The first proper effect follows from there, as a very smart and fast 
gouraud shaded space ship flies across the screen at all kinds of 
angles, pushing the essential '3D-ness' to the max.. At the same time, 
a sparse but well laid out starfield is twisting in time with it, 
giving an illusion of very great smoothness and speed..

The next bit is in the well presented but seen it before category as 
well, as a shaded heart-shaped polygon spins around, and another logo 
lurks uneasily in the top left hand corner.. Before we are too long 
into this screen, a whole bunch of other 3-D objects come to join in 
the fun, and attach themselves to the heart-shaped object, making a 
complex 3-D object that defies an easy description.. The odd still 
picture makes an appearance in this demo, and the one that follows this 
effect is that of an interlaced hi-res screen of a crouching and rather 
cat-like female.. Some brief credits with a starfield follow..

Next up is a 3-D textured pyramid, which seems to be reflecting the 
patterns on two flat plates on the top and bottom of the screen..

Heading towards the mid-point of the demo, we are given yet more 
objects and effects of a 3-D persuasion, only these are rather more 
current in nature.. Various objects are environment mapped to give a 
complex truecolour shade effect, we even get a kettle, as well as the 
traditional doughnuts and ninja throwing stars.. Nice understated blue 
background, and nice tv-like border as well..

The next effect is also a fairly new, or at least rarely seen one as 
well.. This is a box-like polygon, but with one side open, and giving 
the impression that there are several other smaller and smaller boxes 
in there, stacked in a 'russian doll' like fashion.. This one is 
twisting and turning, and all the other boxes spin around in their own 
way, trying to keep up, as well.. Not too bad!!

An abrupt kicking in of a new soundtrack announces the second part of 
the demo.. This starts simply, with a fullscreen/ spinning big cube 
combination, which slowly evolves into a spinning big box with 
truecolour shades on it, then a smaller box which seems to warp for a 
bit, then goes back to bigness and has various patterns forming inside 
it to give more complex colour transformations..

The final full effect is a bloody excellent rotate and zoom.. Oh no, 
you cry, not an effect from the very earliest days of Falcon demos, but 
this one is better than all the rest.. It starts off all blurry, and 
you are momentarily deceived into thinking that a plasma tunnel or 
texture tunnel is coming into play. The zoom bit comes in, and you 
realise that it is a rotate n' zoom after all.. But there are no jaggy 
bits!! Some kind of interpolation or blur effect makes it look nicer 
when you zoom close up.. A bit later on, it wobbles and warps as well..

A good note to finish on, as the end credits bustle in..


TECH VIEW: Two similar demos - this and Joint Venture - grace our 
pages this issue, where the demo is a collection of coder's old 
effects libraries stuck together.  Of the two, "Most Wanted" is 
probably the one more at the cutting edge in programming, despite the 
dodgy gfx and sound. The final effects by Nullos are all DSP-based and 
very nice. The first rgb cube is done by merely interpolating all 3 
values using the DSP - he then ruins the effect with the dodgy second 
part (where the colours on the left and right side of each polygon 
always remain constant.)

The rotating zoomer is a truly nice bit of coding, since it 
interpolates between the individual pixels of the bitmap. There are 
three ways to do this - (a) using a huge pre-interpolated graphic, as 
on the end zoomer of the Avena FB3 demo (b) doing proper interpolation 
with the DSP or (c) doing a gouraud-interpolation along part of a 
scanline when the consecutive pixels of the rotated screen remain at 
the same pixel of the bitmap. Got that? Either way it's very nice.

The other effects show originality too, the gouraud graphics use a 
moire-shading technique involving a carry bit to give a smoother 
interpolation effect, but look a bit slow. More interesting objects 
though, but a few sorting and visible-surface errors tend to spoil 
this a bit. A touch of "phong" too. Overall a very good show. A bit 
more work and this could have been really classy. [tat]



ÅRatings..

Graphix:- 85% - Nothing really great here, although very nicely 
presented and slickly moved around.. Some still screens, logos etc, 
seemed to be higher resolution but only limited colours??

ÅSonix:- 80% - Competent 'funky soundtracks, both of them..

ÅGee-Whiz:- 89% - Some things old, more things new.. Some nice and 
noteworthy variations on the 3-D theme, and that excellently done 
rotate and zoomer at the end..

ÅOverall:- 87% - A pretty standard 'good' Falcon demo with some 
outstanding individual bits..
