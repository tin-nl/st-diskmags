                            Poetry Corner
                 with celebrity presenter, Jody Smith

        Twas the night before Christmas and  all through the house, no
one was stirring, apart from a mouse  who had one of those Cup-a-Soups
that's all grainy and dreggy in  the  bottom unless you keep the stuff
active and stir it for ages and that.
        Yes,  it's  Maggie,  yes  it's  poem  corner,  yes  it's  near
Christmas and yes I really do hate those poxy Hovis adverts.
        Stay hungry....

        The following four poems were  written  by  my good self, with
only 'The Hottentot' being written  by  some  other  bloke who had the
poem in a publication.
                                 *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*


 'LOG'
 Log, log,
 It's big, it's brown, it's wood.
 Log, log,
 It's better than bad, it's good.



 'THE TURKEYS'
 The turkeys are making
 A terrible fuss,
 They're tired of waiting
 To get on the bus.

 They're flapping and fighting,
 Oh, what a do!
 If only those turkeys
 Could learn how to queue.



 'BOY RACER'
 Buy a car and spray it black,
 Put fucking huge speakers in the back.
 Pull away with screeching wheels,
 Hear the tarty girlies squeal.

 Rev past, through the traffic lights,
 He might not be so lucky, one of these nights.
 You may snarl and whine and say it's obscene,
 But you'll be just the same when you're nineteen.



 'THE HOTTENTOT'
 (used in Shakespeares Sister's 'I Don't Care')

 In a brawliolic iceberg came Victoria,
 Queen Victoria, sitting, shocked upon the rocking horse, ever way,
 Said to the lawyer:

 This meat's so coarse and is sharp as any lynx and blacker, deeper
 than the drinks,
 As any hottentot, without remorse, for the minx that  she and the
 drinks who can see,

 Are as hot as any hottentot.
 (They're not the goods for me).
 Hot as any hottentot,
 They are not the goods for me.

        (Include soon more poems,  won't  you  Chris!  Groovy.  I hope
your resident poem blokey won't get  pissed  at this, but hey, you can
always just use  my  poems.   Delete  this  bracketed  bit  too, okay?
Aren't these star + dash borders grest, eh?  That is all.  Goodbye.)

     HOORAY!
So we DO have one reader of da' corner.  The most kind (mad?) Mr. (??)
Jody Smith has sent us  the  fruits  of his/hers/its labours (i.e. the
above four poems) and very good  they  are  too.  It also means that I
have half as much work to do :)
what a nice man...
                                                       (er.. woman?)
                                                       (er.. )

     So welcome once again to POETRY  Corner, the corner that puts the
'C' in Corny and the  'P'  in  craP  or  something.. anyway I digress.
Enough of these (drunken?)  ramblings  and  let  us  get  down to some
serious literature (yes we do read here at the Muggie HQ (that was not
even vaguely amusing -Ed)).

     We'll begin with a bit of a  famous  one, kind of on the lines of
last time's subject, but hey!   even  Shakespeare couldn't be original
all of the time so stop complaining..:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and talking of Shakespeare..

                         "Is this a Phenix which I see before me,"
                         "The keyboard toward my hand?"
                         "Come, let me clucth thee: - "
                         "I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."

 Sorry..
   er.. Onward!

          ALASTAIRBODINWOCKY.

'Twas brillig and the slithy PC owners
     Did moan and minge about the Pentium being out of date:
All pissed-off were the Windows 95 owners,
     When they discovered it was 1997.

"Beware the Microsoft, my son!"
     The jaws that bite (your purse), the claws that crash! (a lot!)
Beware the BillGates bird, and shun
     His indoctrinating lectures on the future of the PCPCPCPC!"

He took his vorpal Atari mouse in hand:
     Long time the moneygrabbing foe he sought-
So rested he by the Atari UK grave
     And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in nostalgic remeniscing he stood,
     The AlastairBodinWocky, with eyes of disbelief,
Was blundering through unemployment wood,
     And complained about washing machines as it came!

"One, two!  One, two!  And through and through
     The vorpal cursor went double-click!
The AlastairBodinWocky ran off in a to do
     He'd never then (or since) moved so quick!

"And, hast thou slain the AlastairBodinWocky?
     Come to my Falcon, my Atarish boy!
O frabjous day!  Callooh!  Callay!"
     He threw some disks in the air in his joy.

'Twas brillig and the slithy PC owners
     Did moan and minge about the MMX being out of date:
All pissed-off were the Windows 97 owners,
     When they discovered it was 1997, and a half!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's an old, tried and tested  one for you.. (STOP complaining, this
is free! gratuit! non payee! etc..)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     LOUSY.

     It was the night after Christmas
     And all through the house
     Nothing was stirring not even a louse.

(Because everyone was too stuffed  with  Xmas  cake  and mince pies to
heave their protesting bodies out of  where  they had settled into the
armchair, to switch on the telly  (that's what remote control are made
for don't ya know))

     CHRISTMAS AVEC LA FAMILLE.

     Auntie screeched: "Pass the cranberry sauce!"
     Cousin Gertrude yelled: "That was my toy horse!"
     Grandpa held up his hand for Grace
     As Uncle Tom loudly inquired 'if he'd liked the vase.'
     Squabbles broke out over cracker toys,
     Aunt Mildred teased Eliza about the boys,
     Grandma said: "It's so nice we're all here together,
     But isn't it a shame about the dismal weather."
     Baby Bradley began to scream and wail
     But the cat only scratches when someone pulls its tail
     And as Brad made an exit with his mum quite irate
     Timely Tibbles jumped up and began to lick his plate.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ah doesn't that just bring back memories..

     all those Christmas dinners
          all those relations
               all that arguing

Christmas...
     what a nightmare ;)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


     Ode to Snow.

     Oh how
     I like snow.
     It's cold
     And when rolled
     It can become
     Quicker* than the Pentium!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* to roll down a hill
