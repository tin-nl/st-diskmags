PINBALL FANTASIES

This relatively new game, for the Jaguar console, was first seen 
in action right back at an ECTS show some years ago.  Thankfully 
it was finally on sale at last at the recent crop of Atari shows 
held in September - so I bought a copy of the game.

Based on the classic Pinball games that many of us will have seen 
at pubs and clubs the world over, Pinball Fantasies is another 
step on from this classic game.

With the cartridge plugged into the Jag and with the Jag switched 
on, the usual titles come up on screen.  This then launches into 
the opening screen of Pinball Fantasies, which gives you a choice 
of 4 screens to choose from.

The backgrounds vary in the game from a funfair style display, 
through to a driving based screen.  This is followed by a screen 
based on the famous Vegas gambling casinos, with the final screen 
being literally a bit of a scream, based around a graveyard.  
This screen, incidentally, is called 'Stones and Bones'.

Gameplay is basically the same as what we are used to with 
pinball games of old, but this version is very fast and furious 
in places.  With controls provided by the Jag controller pad and 
the facility to have up to 8 players, playability is excellent.

The backgrounds are very brightly coloured and nicely designed, 
together with the excellent playability it certainly shows that 
the coding team behind the game have done a brilliant job.  
Generally, Pinball Fantasies is one of those many great games 
that exist for the Jag (and believe us, there are a few of these, 
even if they are hard to find in the High Street !!)

Supplied by 16/32 PDL, it was certainly worth œ30.00  ukp of our 
hard-earned money ... hopefully you'll agree with us when you buy 
it !!


Playability - 95%

Graphics - 95%

Sonix - 85%  (some nice tunes play here)

CiH ventures a second opinion..

Pinball Fantasies is a competent execution of the game by 21st 
Century on the Jag.. It is basically the same game we have seen 
on a multitude of other platforms from Amiga to whatever console 
is currently in favour.. You don't get anything extra on this 
version, and I shouldn't think that converting this to the Jag 
involved any great struggles on the part of 21st Century..

You do get four tables with probably the same graphics and sound 
present on any other version of the game.. Still, if you need a 
pinball game on the Jag, then you are in safe hands here with a 
playable and well produced product.. It is always down to 
personal taste, but I prefer 'Obsession', the STe and Falcon 
solution, which seemed to be somehow a tiny bit more responsive 
and natural feeling.. It has a genuinely useful 'tilt' or 'nudge' 
function which actually made a difference to parts of the game.. 

I've come across a PC version of the genre, 'Epic Pinball' which 
had very flashy graphics and sound, but felt totally 
unconvincing, and had a totally useless 'tilt' button which did 
nothing but jumped the screen up a couple of pixels or so.. 
Pinball Fantasies is a somewhat better game than this, you'll be 
pleased to hear..

I would personally rate this one at 85% overall..
