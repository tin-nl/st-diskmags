Kathy Ireland
By Michael Noyce


Kathy Ireland is undoubtedly, in my humble opinion, one of Ñthe, 
if not the, most beautiful and gorgeous women to ever walk upon 
this earth. I consider this article my tribute to her. What a 
woman!

She is married to a doctor and is a mother, giving birth to son 
Erik in May 1994.

Illustrated swimsuit model since 1983. She started her own

Kathy on the Web

It appears I am not the only person to worship Kathy. The 
Internet is full of pages dedicated to her. Most of these contain 
numerous pictures and information collected from various sources.

Please note, the Internet is a very dynamic place with people and 
Web pages moving around. Therefore, these addresses may be out-
of-date at this time. My apologises if they are.
