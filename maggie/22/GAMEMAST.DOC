…Gamesmaster 

I'm writing this  on  the  31st  of  October  which,  as  you know, is
Halloween. On Halloween it is  said  by  some  that  the dead walk the
earth. I turned on the telly at 6pm to find the brain dead walking the
earth, yes, that's right I was watching Gamesmaster.

Gamesmaster is a TV programme  born  off  the early 90's console boom,
it's a weird beast comprising people  playing the latest console games
for the dubious prize of an old Quickshot 1 joystick sprayed with gold
paint in a perspex case (the "Golden  Joystick" award) mixed in with a
few reviews and features.

What Gamesmaster is most famous for though, is as an ego-trip for its'
presenter, Dominik "diseased" Diamond,  a  man whose immense ignorance
of videogames is only  matched  by  his  own sense of self-importance.
I'm reviewing the second program  of  the  new  series which has moved
its' locale from "Heaven" (a  set  consisting  of a few plastic bushes
with some back-projected cloudscapes) to "Atlantis"  (a set with a few
fishing nets draped about).

Diamond is now accompanied by two "mermaids" (a couple of pretty girls
in silver dresses) as opposed to "angels" (a couple of pretty girls in
white dresses) and, in a major  new  advance for sexual equality, they
are now allowed to speak  occasionally.   Of  course,  one of the most
interesting things about Gamesmaster  is  Dominiks' continual attempts
to hide his impending baldness.  Dominik  is  one  of those people who
fails to realise that, while there  is  nothing wrong with being bald,
there are great amounts of humour  to  be  found  in people who try to
hide the fact that they are. As  you  may remenber, in the last series
he used to mess his hair  up  at  the  front to give the impression of
more volume, in this series he has  gone for a uniformly short cut all
over to give the impression that  it  will  all grow back long. But we
know different don't we Dom?

So, now I've set the scene,  what  was  in  this weeks' edition of the
only programme  devoted  to  videogames  on  British  television?   We
started off with a few  news  features-  Nintendo racing game, new FMV
interactive movie rubbish coming out,  and  then proceeded to an event
called "King Combo'96" which is based on the piss-poor Killer Instinct
series of games.

Three players compete to  win  by  accumulating  the maximum number of
combo hits in Killer Instinct Gold  on  the  Nintendo 64, a game which
resembles nothing so much  as  two  plastic  childrens' action figures
woodenly flailing their limbs at each other while someone plays a .MOD
tune in the background. Oddly  enough,  instead  of featuring a really
good beat'em'up like Capcoms' Darkstalkers  2  or SNKs' excellent King
Of Fighters '95 on  the  Neo-Geo,  Gamesmaster  only  seems to feature
stuff produced by companies with large promotional budgets....I wonder
why?

This weeks' guest was Danny John-Jules who plays the Cat in Red Dwarf.
His task was to  play  Wipeout  2097,  a  futuristic  racing game, and
finish in at least third  place  to  win.  Danny,  who in real life is
pretty unrecognisable as the  Cat,  came  across  as  a nice bloke and
finished in second place. Wipeout  is  basically  the same game as the
original but has had its' gameplay  improved, also the scenery doesn't
seem to fall to bits in the  corners  of  the  screen as it did in the
original. One daft idea though is the "autopilot" feature, which Danny
used to win the game. This makes  the computer take over control for a
few seconds when activated. But isn't  it  the point of games that YOU
play the game, not the computer? Trust Psygnosis to try to improve the
gameplay by removing player control!

Now it was time for  the  feature.  In  contrast  to last weeks, which
consisted of Diamond displaying what passes for his sense of humour by
flying off to a Japanese  holiday  resort  and asking people there who
did not speak English too well whether they had "pulled", knowing full
that well they would not know what  he meant, this week he visited the
retro games exhibition at HMV  in  London.   This  was pretty good for
Gamesmaster, a few old  classic  games  were shown including Defender,
Pac-Man, Manic Miner and even  Tats'  favorite, Chuckie Egg 2. Diamond
then got Peter Molyneux (head  of  Bullfrog  and all-round good guy of
the British software industry) to say  a  few  words, what was said is
well worth repeating.

DIAMOND: Is there any lessons that  can  be learned by programmers now
by going back and looking at these old classic games?

PETER MOLYNEUX: Absolutely. I mean  the  thing  is  that all those old
classic games were just totally gameplay orientated. And that's what a
lot of people forget.  You've  got  flashy  graphics, wonderful sound,
great intro sequences and then-  Oops!  It's  the last month before we
finish the game, what have we forgotten? I know- gameplay!

And that,  folks,  was it.  As usual  the program  is  utter  twaddle.
According to Diamond,  this  will  be the  last  series of Gamesmaster
he does, which  in  my  opinion  is  good news. Hopefully,  after this 
the  program  will  be  totally  revamped and presented by someone who
actually has  an interest in videogames and knows what they're talking
about, may I suggest Violet Berlin as a candidate? But knowing the  TV 
companies it'll  probably  just  be scrapped. Ho hum...

After Gamesmaster  came  that  bizarre  extension  of  Phil  Redmonds'
imagination, "Hollyoaks", but  don't  worry  readers, I switched  over
before I  suffered  heavy exposure.  That Blackcurrant Tango advert is 
really good though isn't it?
