ÅAnd here we are again..

This time, writing in a post-show stupor, having done and seen rather 
a lot in the two days we were there.. Maggie 21 was finished in time 
and released there, in spite of our earlier fears that it wouldn't 
make it.. But we did!

Well with issue 22 due at the end of '96, what more is there to do?? 
Let's find out..


ÅAtari Computing take off..

This is in the show report somewhere as well, but what the heck!Å

Atari Computing Magazine had a successful debut at the Autumn Atari 
Shows in late September, with the entire print run of issue one 
entirely selling out, and still more people wanting copies, but having 
to be content with subscriptions instead.. The initial 500 issue 
'Break even' estimate was exceeded by several hundred in any case, 
making the magazine a financially viable proposition.. Indeed, there 
may have been a further reprint to satisfy demand?? 
Å
Issue two will be out for the end of November..Å  Be there!!Å
Å

Nemesis almost there..

A timely update from Titan Designs for this one.. (20.10.96)

Nemesis hardware is now complete! (Hooray!) The manual design is being 
finalised, as great attention to detail is required to correctly 
install the board, and Titan are trying to make the installation 
process as easy to follow as possible.. As far as we are aware, 
extensive testing has also been carried out, with Nemesis coming up as 
totally reliable, even under periods of very extended use.. More on 
this shortly, with (hopefully) a review in Maggie to follow for this 
issue a bit later on..

Additionally, Titan are developing a new software screen enhancer 
which is reportedly better than previous efforts such as Screen 
Blaster or BlowUp.. This will be bundled free with newer versions of 
Apex, and on sale separately at a very keen price.. 
Å

More Atari Shows next year..

Following the successful Autumn Atari Shows sponsored by Mike Goodman, 
it looks like there will be more shows for early next year, including 
one in Scotland.. More details on dates and venues as we get them 
folks..
Å

VoGue not Foggy!

John Nott has asked us to point out that although he has taken over 
the computing assets of Richard 'Former head of Falcon Owners Group' 
Davey, he is not actually restarting the group.. Time based 
considerations are the reason why, as he considers FOG to be a full 
time operation to run properly, which time Richard Davey never really 
had, and he hasn't got either.. However, the Atari Net Locator site 
will still be kept up to date, and the disk magazine, smart new unseen 
custom shell and all, may well still be revived, with a tentative 
release towards the year end..

Å
Karsmakers to become PC Dad! 

Something which was on the cards for some time, (about three issues of 
ST-News ago!) but sad to see nevertheless..

Rich K, former editor of 'ST-News' is to liquidate his remaining Atari 
related assets and acquire a PC 'Gemulator' style board, mainly for 
historical interest in maintaining his ST News collection.. Quite how 
he is going to get to see future issues of Maggie, let alone anything 
else interesting on the Atari ST or Falcon remains to be seen.. He is 
still willing to write for us on a occasional basis, and is going 
ahead with the 'ST-News lamentation' Web pages..  


ÅThe bloody stupid things people say - Episode XIV.. 

(This one in a recent issue of Silicon Times Report)

_______________________________________________________________________
From the Atari Editor's Desk              "Saying it like it is!"

As I sit here putting together this week's column, it's Halloween night
and I'm looking for a way to sneak past  my wife and attack the bowl of
candy sitting near the door!I live in the city, and "trick or treaters"
are sparse  in the neighborhood;  we usually end up  eating most of the 
Halloween treats eventually...  But, it's still fun to see the kids all
dressed up,  walking up and down the streets... the squeal of "Trick or
Treat!" echoing in the air.
ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ
Hmmm, I feel a bit of a 'Gus Spank' interlude coming on..

'Trick or Treat', recently imported American custom to benefit cheap 
plastic novelty manufacturers, or doorstep kiddie extortion given 
official blessing, you decide! 

I don't know what kind of neighbo(u)rhood the Silica Times people live 
in, but around here, kids grow up fast, with a frightening semi-
criminal precociousness.. 'Trick or Treat' here consisted of a huge 
hammering on my front door, until I thought that it was going to come 
off the hinges.. Feeling reluctant to open the door to such a police 
raid style summoning, I reeled open an upstairs window, to spot two of 
the little darlings in 'Friday the 13th' masks.. I did not somehow feel 
inspired to open the door to them.. At least we didn't get a 'trick', 

Another report that came to me from a work collegue was interesting.. 
His 'trick or treat' visitors had got into costume to the extent of 
pulling their coats over their faces, which sort of smacks of not 
really trying too hard.. 

Add to that, a certain peculiar tension, that they *might* just come 
back and set your car alight, and you realise that 'Trick or Treat' is 
just a Middle American suburban fantasy disconnected from the reality 
that some children ought not to be given a special day to make 
mischief, as they are proficient in the art for the other 364 days of 
the year!  

At the risk of sounding like a "TWMBIMD" (Things were much better in 
*my* day) I would say that 'Trick or Treat' is a recent invention 
here.. We had 'Halloween' for sure, but not anything like this.. I'm 
always suspicious of hastily grafted-on "traditions" that are designed 
to benefit certain vested interests, usually greeting card and cheap 
novelty retailers.. I'm sure most of our US readers feel the same way 
about "importing" Brazilian Killer Bees through their southern border!

Summing it all up, Trick or Treat in the UK, as real as the leaves on 
an articifial Christmas tree, as old as Windows '95, as sincere as a 
politicians pre-election promise.. In short, BOLLOCKS!!


ÅNew Jaguar Games..
 
ÑAs far as I know, Breakout 2000 and Towers II are due towards the end 
of this year, and the other games are due in Jan/Feb 1997.. What is 
most interesting is that Zero-5 is back on!! - CiH.. (News extract from 
Silicon Times..)

New game information

Here are some new games that are coming out soon!  Check them out and 
see which ones are for you.

Towers II 
BattleSphere 
Worms 
Breakout 2000 
Zero-5

NEW! 

I've spoken with Telegames and GO ATARI.....They state that the 
following games will be entering production later this week (8th oct.):

Towers II by JV Games 
Breakout 2000 by Atari 
Zero Five by Atari 
Worms by Team 17....published by Telegames..

That's them....a KILLER line-up if ya ask me! I've been dying to play 
NEW Jaguar games! Long Live the Jaguar!  Towers II is said to be 
available in the 2nd or 3rd week of November....can't wait!

4-Play went in and added a whole new mode of gameplay to BattleSphere!  
They expect a few more weeks of  coding, then it should take around a 
month to put it through production.  There is talk of a new Jaguar 
developer....He states that he's working on 4 new Jag titles which 
sounded  great,  at the same time.....how he's going to get these 
published is a mystery.  That's all the news for now..."

Tom Harker of ICD and 4-PLAY tells Raymond:

"I think everyone left in a publishing position will be closely 
watching the success or failures of this new batch  of games published 
by Telegames and of BattleSphere by 4Play. If there is enough support 
left in the userbase  so we don't lose money, then I am sure that 
someone will be interested in publishing completed titles." 


ÅNew Falcon Clone..

According to recent reports, in addition to the already existing C-Lab 
Falcons, Medusa, Hades et al, a new contender for Atari clone of the 
year is due to shimmer into sight shortly.. This machine is made by 
Centek of France, and apparently Falcon based with a 68040 processor, 
enhanced DSP and some other goodies.. Sounds rather good, and we should 
hopefully have some more information shortly..

Phone Rings.. It's Leon..

(Some time later..)

Well, it does sound rather good, sort of an Atari 'Microbox' level of 
goodness, more details elsewhere in the mag!



    (Excuse me  Chris, do you mind if I just butt in  here? -Ed C.)

    (Oh, alright then, -CiH)

ÅStone Age Man forgets the secret of fire
and is doomed to Extinction!!

I'm not usually the sort of  person  who makes  fun  of  Amiga  owners
(PC  people are much more  deserving  of  bile)  but  this is  a  tale
that  must be told. I promise you, unbelieveable as it seems, this  is
a true story, only the names  have  been removed. It goes  like  this.
Bloke  buys  an Amiga, but is  totally ignorant about computers. Bloke
solely  uses  said  computer  for   playing  games,  but  needs  blank
formatted  disks  to use for save game files.

Enlists help of older brother,  who  is   an Amiga owner of some years
standing. He is shown how to format a  disk and also how to use a disk
copier  program  for  good   measure.   A   few   weeks   later  it is
discovered that  said  Amiga  owner  has  been  "formatting"  disks by
keeping a blank formatted disk  to  one  side  and using the disk copy
program to copy it to  an  unformatted  disk,  every time. Amazing but
true folks.

ÑCiH comment:- Surely the hapless idiot in question would have been 
better off with a console of some kind?? (Take the PlayStation 
f'rinstance, beats the hell out of having to keep hitting those crap 
fingertip sized knobbly things on top of the unit to get it to do 
anything!?!?!!)


ÅIntel Strikes again!

Has everyone seen that Pentium advert on  telly? The one with the  old
bloke  playing Monopoly on his  PC?  Is  that  weird or what? "This is
the  Pentium  processor that runs the CD  ROM that allows you to  play
Monopoly  with   3D  animation  on  your  PC.  And,  because  it  is a
CONNECTED  CD  ROM, it plugs into your computers' Internet link so you
can play against someone on the  other  side of the world. Which makes
you glad  you  have  the  Pentium processor in your PC."

Er.. hang on Mr. Intel, apart  from  the  fact that you can buy a copy
of the board  game  for   much   less   than   the   cost  of a new PC
(currently between ú1000 and ú1500)  and  play  with the people in the
next room, what is all this guff  about a CONNECTED CD ROM? What would
a DIS-CONNECTED CD ROM  do  I  wonder?

Looking  carefully   at  my  own  computer  I've  found   I   have   a
CONNECTED  printer  plus  a CONNECTED  monitor and a  CONNECTED  mouse
too.  And,  speaking  as  an  assembly  language programmer, I've read
books  on  programming the Intel series  of processors  which  is  why
I'm  glad  I  HAVEN'T  got  the Pentium processor inside my "PC".

Wouldn't  a  more   realistic  advert  go  like  this...."This  is the
Pentium  processor.  The Pentium processor allows you to play Quake at
a  decent  speed.  Because  it  evolved  out  of  the Intel 8008 which
came out in 1972, and  was an inferior  CPU to the one in the Sinclair
Spectrum,  the  instruction  set  isn't  very  good  and  uses  memory
segmentation so most people program  it  in  C to save themselves lots
of headaches. This means  programs  don't  run  very fast and use lots
of extra memory. This   allows   you   to   spend  more and more money
constantly  expanding  your  PC,  adding  more  memory  and  a  faster
processor, before it can run the latest  software  at  a decent speed.
Which makes you glad you're  another  mindless  lemming!"


ÅSony go back to the Bedroom..

In a pretty unexpected move, it seems Sony are to release the "Yaroze"
in the UK  this  spring.  A  Yaroze  is  basically  a home Playstation
development kit, that was originally released in Japan a while ago and
was destined for schools and colleges there. From what I can gather it
is some sort of modified Playstation  that  plugs  into a PC and comes
with development software allowing you to write your own games for it.

This isn't as fun as it sounds  though  as it seems that Sony will not
allow you to  publish  any  games you  write  on  the Yaroze yourself.

(Hmm... I wonder what huge Japanese company whose name begins with "S"
does get the rights over the games  you write on it?...) plus the fact
that it costs ú599 without the  essential  PC  you  need to use it. It
seems this is an attempt for  Sony  to  get  some new blood into their
Playstation games, which is  especially  needed  when  you realise the
fact that 90% of Playstation wares are  50 quids' worth of fast 3D and
not much else.

Apparently Sony decided  to  release the  Yaroze  in the UK because of
our  proud  tradition  of  home  development.  But surely, that mainly
came about because in  the  early  eighties  the  UK was full of cheap
home computers and had  a decent  computer press that featured regular
tutorials on programming, not  the  PC  CD ROM Passive Consumer Multi-
tedia abomination we have today?  Could  be  interesting to see how it
does though...

Predictably,  "Edge"  has gone  bonkers over  the Yaroze, calling it a 
visionary move by Sony. It also makes the  laughable  allegation  that
it is  an affordable product, as it only costs the  same  as the Amiga
when it first came out.  When the Amiga first came out,  nobody bought
it because it was too expensive! Oh, and is  Edge  including the extra
ú1000 for the essential bolt-on developers PC in its' calculations, by
the  way?   It  will be interesting to see how the Yaroze does, though
it's  important  to  remember  that the bedroom programmer already has
the means  to create great  games at home right now,  namely  on  what 
you're  reading  this on!

(Okay, back over to you now Chris, Ed)

ÑEr, thanks ed,- CiH..


ÅJust Fancy That!

                       INTEL URGED TO SLOW DOWN

A  Gartner Group analyst  says Intel's relentless  drive toward higher 
powered microprocessors is wearing down PC makers and buyers. Computer
manufacturers  "would  love to skip a  generation and  I think the end 
users  would  love to skip  a generation,"  he suggests.  In response, 
Intel is working on a  module that would  allow users to install a new 
microprocessor in their existing machines.  

(Wall Street Journal 20 Nov 96 B1)

(Following on from that story, and as a typical response, Intel 
announce the Klamath, a new variation on the Pentium Pro, capable of 
anything up to 300mhz! Power junkies with more cash then sense will 
have to wait until later in 1997 though..) 

(Klamath, hmmm, sounds like one of the bad guys out of Startek!?)

("But captain, the Klamath have entered the neutral zone, and are 
attacking outpost four!")


And this in from Michael Burkley, the Unabashed Atariophile and now, 
part time PC owner as well..

"Oh,  and trying to start Windows 95  after it crashes!  Here's  what I 
have to do...turn the  computer on and have  the Windows 95 screen come
up.  Shut the computer off  when the screen freezes.  Turn the computer 
back on and have it start up in "Safe Mode." Shut the computer off when
"Safe Mode" doesn't help and the computer freezes again. This time when
I turn it on it will likely boot all the way (hurrah!),  but now I have 
to "quit"  and  re-start  the computer with  the full  set of  drivers. 
Finally,  I can begin working...  until it crashes again. The  dealers' 
reaction? "I wonder why it does that?""


And finally, this sad missive from Noreen Taylor, writing to the Times 
newspaper about Bill Gates.. You'll need a rather large capacity sick 
bucket to be able to get to the end of this one....

"After all, the man's a genius. Chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, 
he's considered one of the century's foremost thinkers. A frontier 
scout, exploring the canyons of cyberspace, blazing trails where no 
hacker has dared take his mouse, Bill is probably the most brilliant 
programmer of the age as well as one of it's most ruthlessly 
competitive and successful businessmen... There's no such word as 
hyperbole when you're in the presence of the king of kings, the master 
of all universes, the richest American citizen, whose personal fortune 
is estimated at $13 billion (8 billion UKP). Awesome or what?"

foremost thinkers', was it Gerbil Monthly Magazine??- CiH..


ÅMissing Sammy Joe found!

IRC surfer Tat recently came across someone who used to be very 
intimately connected with Maggie in the early days.. yes, its that 
oversexed and long blonde haired German expatriate Sammy Joe, aka 
Michael Schussler, aka the original editor of Maggie up to issue nine.. 

When asked what he was up to now, he replied that his interests were 
concentrated around high powered motorbikes and the odd bit of net-
surfing. I seem to remember that a very fast form of serial monogamy 
with several women was one of his major interests aside from Maggie as 
well (known in less enlightened circles as a "one night stand").. More 
worryingly, he is now working at a bank in Frankfurt, which I believe 
is the financial centre for Germany, which makes you wonder if he is 
ultimately going to be the guy in charge of this new European single 
currency when it comes about..

We'll know for sure if the banknotes have some fairly explicit cartoon 
self-portraits of the Lost Boys on them! 


ÑWe were asked to put this cautionary little tale in by the author, 
fortunately, it had a happy ending.. One of our other contributors was 
not so lucky when some friends of his were involved in an accident.. 
Our best wishes go out to him accordingly.. CiH/Maggie Team..


                       Bit of an accident

                        By John Hayward


Apologies to everybody I could not go to the first meeting at WAG user 
group.   I  was  involved in a severe car accident,  which left  me in 
hospital.

I just went round the corner to my local postal office at 9.00  in the 
evening  to get some stamps out  of  a  vending  machine  to  write to 
various contacts of mine. I was walking home and I suddenly saw a fire
engine with its lights blazing with a red  Peugeot in front going at a 
slow pace, which seem reluctant to move out of the way.

He then decided to turn right into a small side road,   and was trying 
to  accelerate away when the engine clipped the back of the 405 making 
a  hideous  bang  and a crunch,  I was walking along the pavement when 
about fifteen tonnes  worth  of  Dennis (Fire Engine)  comes  hurtling 
towards me. I seem to stand stunned and I was listening to my portable 
CD player so I was not paying full attention.  

I don't remember if I managed to  sub-consciously  throw myself over a 
garden wall or if I was pushed by the front of the engine,  I then was
thrown  into  a  front  garden  of a house with the remains of a brick 
garden wall raining on top of me.   I tried to get up and found myself
completely covered blood and unable  to talk for five minutes with the 
shock, although I did not get any fractures or concussion.

I  would  like to take the opportunity if Roy could thank the fire men 
for making  a  terrific job of getting the police and the ambulance so 
quickly, and getting me to QA Hospital so fast.

I was the only person hurt,  I  was  only a few inches from being very 
dead.  It was lucky I was not a child or a pensioner,  as  I  may have 
gone to hospital in a body bag instead of a stretcher.

I  was  let  out  of  hospital  at  2am in the morning after needing 7 
stitches in my scalp and several cuts and bruises.   My  CD player was 
unscathed  which I paid ú110 for a week before,  but my headphones and 
glasses were flattened and I had a large tear in my jeans.

Our  fire  service  do  a great job, and if you are being pursued by a 
fire engine, don't try and speed up or turn in into another road, just 
get out of the BLOODY WAY!


ÅThat's it for another issue..

Well, that's it for another issue, and, oh...
