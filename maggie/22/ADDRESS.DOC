Contact the Maggie Team at:

CIH/Maggie Style Homeboy
26 Robinson Road
Rushden
Northants NN10 0EH
England

Anyone with a modem see below for an alternative suggestion..

Also now on Internet!!

Contact us on either, felice@rushden.demon.co.uk,

or cih@rushden.demon.co.uk.

Both are routed through Felice's own mailbox, so any email will 
go to him first anyway.. I might just one day get my own modem, 
but laziness and fear of phone bills has an amazingly strong 
'cold shower' effect on the whole idea at the moment..

**Important note**

There is a distinct possibility that our E-mail addresses may 
well change over soon.. Its all very vague at the moment, but the 
new Internet provider suggested is 'Zetnet'.. If there is a 
changeover, the current Demon' addresses will be kept running on 
for a while, and all regular contacts will be told if and when we 
do move.. More definite details next issue.. 

Maggie Web Pages!!

Just click on the following..

       http://www.airtime.co.uk/stosser/home.htm

Click on the diskmags icon and take it from there..

**Another important note**

This has been delayed due to hold ups in the production of this 
issue of Maggie, but watch out for something new on the Website 
front coming soon!!


Where do I get the latest Maggie online?

ftp.uni-kl.de  [in]  pub/atari/incoming
               [or]  pub/atari/diskmagazines

Alternatively, try your usual bulletin board.. One definite 
location with its own Maggie dedicated file area for back issues 
etc, is 42 BBS, who can be contacted on the following (UK) 
telephone number, which goes as follows, 01256 895106..


Who do I contact concerning this diskmag?

CIH's address(es) (see above)..

(The inevitable plea)

Maggie is a 'happening' diskmag, that is, it 'happens' as and 
when we have enough articles to do a new issue.. If you want it 
to 'happen' a bit more often, then some more articles might be a 
good idea.. Our regular contributors would really enjoy the odd 
new perspective now and again, and who knows, it could be the key 
to eventual fame and fortune for you..

Now I'm not going to threaten to close the mag if no-one writes 
in like some other diskmag editors tend to do, we enjoy doing 
this too much to do that, but I'm really enamoured of the idea of 
sitting back and watching a whole host of third party talent 
flood into the mag, prodded along by helpful threats from me, the 
editor.. I often have dreams about it.. Come on, make those 
dreams come true!! - Write today!
