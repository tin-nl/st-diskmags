 Some notes on another genre revivial..

Last issue's review of Kakanoid was clearly the first breaking of a new 
wave of games based on that old Atari Corp inspired favourite, 
Breakout.. I fact, I wonder why it took so long for people to try to 
surpass the beautifully designed and coded official Atari effort, that 
was given away *free* in their Falcon software pack.. An act of hugely 
overwhelming generosity for which we are all truly grateful for..

Wobbly GEM-based game fans may well be disppointed with this latest 
attempt at doing a good breakout game.. For example, it features a 
smart custom drawn front end, a rotating ball sort of intro, and a 
smart techno sound track kicks in.. Not good if you like your games to 
look like the Atari desktop.. We move onto a smart options screen, 
glimpsing the credits and high score screens., More high quality 
work in evidence.. Surely the (ex) Atari people who gave us their 
seminal version of Breakout are spinning in their cheap plywood coffins 
by now..

The main game itself must be a disappointment as you are presented with 
a lavishly drawn main game screen with loads of coloured bricks to 
knock out.. This is not quite as lavishly drawn as the other major 
Falcon bat and brick effort 'MultiBriques', but it is not very far off, 
and scores over that game in a number of other ways.. The quality of 
work is very high, and up to the standard required for a good current 
Falcon game..

Sonically, this game is brilliant, the full version promising several 
multi-channel soundtracks of the highest quality (See the technical 
notes below as to how this is done.. Something very similar to what 
Maggie uses for the Falcon shell in fact.. Added to the constant music 
are the normal sampled sound effects, metallic clunks, pings and 
explosions, all nicely understated.. Major event changes, such as 
power-ups are announced by a clearly sampled (and English, according to 
the blurb) female voice..

Where this gets out and walks over all the others, especially the Atari 
version, is in the uniquely thought out power-ups and variations on the 
basic game.. A lot of new ground was covered by Arkanoid all those 
years ago, and is repeated here, with vari-patterned bricks, bricks 
that take several hits to be demolished, awkward angles for the ball to 
get to, and a range of power-ups to enhance your bat..

A lot of the 'usual' ones are there, sticky bat to retain and redirect 
the ball, longer and shorter bats, a gun to shoot the blocks (on 
certain levels) and so on.. Teknoball takes things quite a bit further 
with such things as an extra ball (some levels tend to have these sort 
of powerups fall in sequence, so you can end up with several balls in 
the air at once) a 'magnetic' bat where the balls are attracted to your 
bat by a mysterious magnetic force, which is usefull for some levels 
with awkward corners where you can direct the ball to a certain 
extent.. Another one unique to this game is a 'freeze' option where you 
freeze the ball in midair, and collect any power-ups coming down the 
screen.. This game also has a 'smart bomb' option, which is very useful 
on certain levels.. These are deployed with the right hand mouse 
button, and depend on where the ball is at the time.. They are 
replenished in a randomly dropping power-up sort of fashion..

These power-ups come in handy for other reasons, as on level four of 
the demo version,. a certain amount of blasting-based action enters the 
picture. A large boulder like construction bobs up and down the screen, 
so in addition to catching your own ball, you are having to avoid, or 
shoot, or bomb these large and lethal objects as well.. A bomb is 
pretty conclusive, but a gun takes a few shots to get rid of them.. But 
then they split into smaller and smaller components, a la Asteroids as 
well!! At this point, things get pretty hairy..

After about five or so levels, you also get an end of level guardian, 
which can be disposed of by a number of methods, depending on what 
you've got to hand..

All in all, a challenging and enjoyable Arkanoid clone for the Falcon, 
with a lot of unique twists of its own.. The best news is that it is a 
very reasonable 60 FF or equivalent to register as shareware (About Ten 
UKP) (See below for the address)

Finally, some information from the author to conclude with..

   Some technical notes that could interest someone.

-The  whole  game  is  coded  in 68000 assembly language. It is 20800
lines  long,  plus  generated  code  for  the  sprites. The code isnt
perfect, but I'm tired...

-The  soundtrack  rout have been coded by Laurent de Soras (Dumbo/big
noz) for the Graoumf Tracker, an EXCELLENT shareware tracker. It uses
the DSP, and the quality is 16 bits stereo at 50 khz of course.

-The  musics  uses from 4 to 8 voices, and the sound fxs use 6 voices.
So 14 voices of sound.

-The game runs in one vbl on any kind of monitor.howewer on VGA there
might  be  slowdowns  in shoot'em'up parts. Slowndowns are one of the
easiest things to obtain on a standard Falcon. (sigh):-(

-Sprites  collisions  are  made  to  pixel  precision.  They  use the
blitter.  To  know  more  about this technic please see the HTC 3, by
EKO. (Patrice Mandin article)

-The  generated  code  is based on routs first seen inside the french
mag 'ST magazine'.

NB  :  50 megs to install the W(omiting system)indow 95! I just can't
believe  it!  In 40 megs I've installed a complete Linux distribution
with C++, and so on... Thanks Micros.ft. In fact I'm not concerned as
I  don't have (and DONT want to have) a PC. But, Atarians, let's have
a  minute  of  silence  for  all PC users, that ruin themselves for a
crappy system.

That's all folks!
