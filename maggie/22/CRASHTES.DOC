            Crash Test Dummies News for October 9th, 1996


                     Unusual Promotional Antics

In the U.S. we hear that buckets of worms in soil are being given away
with the purchase of A Worm's  Life  (talk  about a free snack)! South
African radio stations received  a  tooth  in  a  vial of formaldahyde
along with He Liked To Feel It  (not a real tooth, surely). In Canada,
the president of our record company  received two pizzas with gummi(?)
worm toppings at lunch time  on  the  day  of release from a prominent
radio station executive  who  was  rumored  to  have  had  his offices
heavily papered with  A  Worm's  Life   posters  earlier  that morning
(Warren and Dale who?).


                        Big Bird Move Over

In Canada some stores  are  carrying  huge  Crash Test Dummies display
units stuffed with A Worm's  Life.  These  units feature huge animated
looking trees with "that bird" sitting in them - wild!

Our sources tell us that the only  other place in the world that these
units are being used is Austria.


                           Single News

In Canada He Liked To  Feel  It  can  be  heard  on almost every radio
station in the country, and the video  is still all over MuchMusic and
MusiquePlus.

The video was added this  week  by  MTV  in  the  U.S.  In the U.K. no
commitment has been made, but we expect them to come around soon. Viva
in Germany, has blurred out 8 shots so as not to offend viewers during
the day. It is rumoured that at night the "un-censored" version can be
seen.


                       Will They Ever Tour?

The band - everyone is on  a  short  break following the promo trip in
Europe. We are eagerly awaiting concert  dates for Canada and the U.S.
for November, but nothing yet!
