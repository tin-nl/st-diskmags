You might remember a preview of a game called Moonspeeder which 
appeared in issue 18 of Maggie. Well things have moved on quite a bit 
further in several respects since last year.. The programmers created a 
full commercial version of the game, then there was a follow-up, Moon 
Games, which was also distributed commercially..

Originally this was done by Compo (France), and the game was available 
on import for a hefty PC game style price.. So it was ignored by the 
vast majority of Falcon owners.. However, Compo went bust (in France as 
in the UK) and the game rights reverted back to the authors who are now 
distributing it as freeware!! - Hurrah!! Which is where we come in 
now with a long-delayed final review..

Over and above the original Moonspeeder, Moon Games does seem to add a 
lot more to the game in terms of the presentation, with plenty of 
elaborate credits and intro sequences over the original game, The very 
beginning of the game starts up with an elaborate title sequence using 
an overhead wobbly view of the textured track to depict the title of 
the game..  Several stunning rendered in-between screens abound, and 
the option/menu screens usually have something else going on, such as a 
plasma type blob gliding across your mouse pointer.. The speeder 
selection screen, one of the best presented bits of the original game, 
somehow seems to have got even better, probably something to do with 
the change in music, there is more of it in this version.. The sensible 
thing to do is to opt for a championship game, where the bit described 
by the next paragraph follows..

There is also a strange little sub-game, where you race around a hall 
of reflective textures as a motorised sphere, trying to find the exit 
within a time limit.. Success in this determines your qualifying 
position on the starting grid of the main race!! Yes, it is as strange 
as it sounds.. You are competing against other little vari-coloured 
spheres, who seem to be quicker at sussing out the exit that you, so 
you are left alone.. You only work out that you are represented by a 
giant marble, by the fact that you catch your reflection in the 
mirrored walls.. Thoroughly confusing.. This seems to be an attempt at 
a separate full game that never really got beyond this tidbit. so got 
stuffed in here instead..

As far as the main game is concerned, not a lot has changed from 
Moonspeeder.. It is still the Falcon's answer to the SNES classic 
racing game 'F-Zero'.. So the main action has not changed at all from 
Moonspeeder, and you still get a lot of fun racing around the texture 
mapped tracks in your polygonal moonbuggies.. All the same power ups 
are there, you get Nitro turbo boosts, lasers, energy replenishments, 
and other tokens that take these away with equal facility, and a 
sampled cackled laugh.. The motion around the track is quite smooth, 
even on a standard 16 mhz '030, and there is an option for this game to 
make use of any accelerator hardware.. Possibly an investigation for 
Inspector Nemesis when he finally turns up at the scene of the crime..

The presentation is attractive, as with the rest of the game, and there 
are heavy use of textures and the more advanced forms of 3-D, even if 
this is a relatively uncluttered game from a visuals point of view.. 
Heavy use of transparency for icons, and the low energy 'warning' for 
your car if you get into trouble on the track..

For a racer, this is a curiously exhilarating game, especially if you 
get a temporary 'flight' powerup in conjunction with a Nitro booster.. 
Sort of gives an unfair advantage a bit like a 300mph booster for Damon 
Hill in his Formula One days..

There is a two player mode on the finished game as well, played as a 
split screen mode on the Falcon, which adds to the social enjoyment 
aspect of the game, especially when the other player does not know what 
they are doing properly and crash all the time (Dave Hollis!).. 

Moon Games is a much larger program than its predecessor, it comes on 
5-6 disks, presumably to contain the greater amounts of track data and 
so on.. Finally you can get to play the full championship season denied 
to you on the demo version.. If it is an easy download you are seeking, 
look elsewhere.. If it is an all too rare blockbuster for the Falcon 
that you lust after in a world of useful but tiddly little proglets, 
then this one is for you! 

Finally, before we cut to the ratings, we must give thanks to the 
programming team (Crac et al) for letting this game go out as freeware 
once their parent company went bust..

ÅRatings..

Graphics:- 91% - Impressive for a game of this type, you are left in no 
doubt this is a Falcon only game..

ÅSonix:- 83% - Well chosen music and sound samples ingame..

Playability:- 90% - A decent 3-D racer with enough added to it to stop 
it becoming repetitive..

Overall:- 89% - Well worth the 5-6 disks worth of space..
