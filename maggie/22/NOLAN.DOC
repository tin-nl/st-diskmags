INTERVIEW WITH NOLAN BUSHNELL -THE GODFATHER OF VIDEO GAMES !!!

Nolan Bushnell invented the video game. We talk to the man who gave the 
world the classic game, 'Pong' and the founder of Atari about  his new 
plans.

About 20 years ago, a young college student called Nolan Bushnell  had 
a rather interesting idea. The thought process was thus: why not create 
a computerised game, present it in a sleek cabinet, position  it at the 
end of the bar and see how much money it takes. The game  in question 
was called Computer Space and it was the very first  arcade game, ever. 
The Japanese might act like they invented video games, the thruth is 
that a technologically savvy West Coast  American college kid did.

Nolan realised that he was on to a good thing when he got a call  from 
the owner of the bar he'd put the prototype game in. The bar  manager 
complained that the machine had stopped working and so  Nolan hot-
footed it down to see what the problem was. Rather than finding a 
frazzled circuit board, or a broken joystick, he  discovered that the 
machine was crammed full of coins - so full in  fact, that it could 
accept no more.

Taking this overwhelming success as a significantly optimistic sign, 
Nolan attempted to get some finance for producing more of the  
machines. The pinball companies he approached turned him down flat  and 
so, in the end, he financed the project himself, with a bit of  help 
from friends and the bank. That week Nolan formed Atari,  a games 
company named after a piece in his favourite board game, Go.

The ups and downs of Atari have been well documented, so suffice to  
say it went from being the largest home console and video games  
manufacturer in the world, to being a third-rate nobody with a  
familiar name and a dearth of original product. Not that Nolan could  
have been that bothered, because he sold the company in the  mid-80s to 
Warner Communications. By the age of 33 he'd effectively  retired, 
multi-millionaire.

THE NAME OF THE GAME

These days Nolan Bushnell is unfazed by the fact he single-handedly  
created the entire video games industry: "I thought it was going  to be 
important, but you never really think in terms of billions of dollars 
when you're just trying to make payroll." We caught up with  him at 
Develop!, a three-day industry conference in which programmers, 
developers get together and chat about PC games.

The first surprise comes when he talks candidly about that mid-80s  
period when he sold Atari. We discuss the way that Atari's collapse  
left a huge hole (a "sucking vacuum" as Bushnell calls it) in the  
industry, which the Japanese were only too happy to fill. As we chat, 
it becomes perfectly clear that Nolan has little time for Japanese  
games developers. He never wants to see another simplistic fighting  
game as long as he lives, and he's willing to bet that the  
overwhelming majority of people agree with him.

Rather than ducking the questions about the mistakes he made 15 years 
ago, he's surprisingly forthcoming - bullish even. He clearly  regrets 
ever letting Atari go and is scathing of Warner's failed use  of the 
company: "I think I could have made a whole series of  different 
mistakes, I wouldn't have made the ones they made." And he backs up 
this statement by pointing out that he made just as much  money from 
selling the Warner stock he got in the sale of Atari as  he did from 
the sale itself. "The only mistake I really made was  that I thought it 
was going to crash a year before it actually did."

Somewhat unsurprisingly, he doesn't rate the Tramiels very highly  
either: "In some ways Atari was in a position to have been Microsoft, 
Apple and Nintendo, all rolled into one. That opportunity was  
squandered." He does admit that when Jack Tramiel bought Atari he  got 
little more than the name, but (nd this is true of the company  even 
today): "They were opportunistic in terms of technology, but  they 
never did learn how to market."

VIEW FROM THE BAR
Nolan, looking for all the world like Howard Keel, is a man of great 
stature, both physically and in terms and in terms of the shadow  that 
he still casts over the industry. He is, in many ways, the  Godfather 
of the video games industry and he's in town to talk about  a new 
venture. Nolan Bushnell sees the future of the video game in  two very 
different places; he sees it going back to the bars and  clubs from 
whence it emerged and he sees it going on-line and  becoming a mass 
participation phenomenon. To this end, he's  involved in a couple of 
companies, one of which is creating the  first bar-top video console, 
while the other is attempting to link  up huge numbers of games players 
across the United States.

Perhaps the best way of describing Bushnell's approach is a cautious  
innovator. He reckons that "slow buffalos get shot and pioneers get  
arrows in the back", and so the route to success in the video games  
industry lies somewhere between those two. With this in mind, he's  
happy to let on-line gaming companies such as Catapult and Mpath  
trail-blaze while he observes their mistakes.

LIFE ON-LINE
Bushnell's approach to on-line gaming is very different to the  classic 
model. "We're taking an Internet that exists, ISPs that  exist, PCs 
that exist, and we're putting cool software on top of it, and so our 
return on capital is on a very different scale to theirs." Or in other 
word, the companies are making things unnecessarily  complex.

Part of the complexity that Nolan refers to again and again, during  
our interview, is tied up in the games software that's being used.  
It's for this reason that he's designing brand new games, which he  
will be marketing through his start-up company Vent Inc. He reckons  
that in order to appeal to the masses, the video game equivalent  of a 
back to basics campaign is called for.

"Let me put it this way - would you rather have another Duke Nukem,  or 
Tetris?" And while all you action game fans will have no problem  
plumping for Duke every time, you have to take his point - the  
overwhelming majority of people aren't games fanatics and would  
probably go for Tetris every time. The problem lies in the technical 
complexities of these games. Duke Nukem and Quake are "great fun  with 
a group of people", but they're simply not suited to the  high-latency 
networks caused by the world's phone system. So, instead of Duke or 
Quake, Bushnell envisages a couple of sports games and a capture the 
Flag-style of event in which as many as 10,000 people  could compete 
against 10,000 other people.

The way that he describes this concept does, admittedly, sound great. 
The way it'll work is that all the people in City A will be on one  
side, and all the people in City B will be on another. There's a  flag 
in a bunker and each side has to capture it. But rather than  having 
10,000 people all legging it after one flag, there will be  tanks, 
aircraft, infantry and jeeps and there'll be a command  structure  with 
Captains, Commanders and Generals. More interestingly, everyone will 
have to qualify to do their job - you just can't  say: 'I'm a general' 
and expect everyone to follow you; you have to  pay your dues.

HE HAS A DREAM
It might be 20 years after Nolan Bushnell first created Pong, but his 
latest batch of ideas prove that he's every bit the visionary now that 
he was then. He has a completely realistic approach to selling video 
games that's often lacking from other companies. He wants to create 
games that are "inclusive" and "playable". 

While other companies produce games that force the same rigid roles on 
people that they experience in  society he  believes  that  "there  are
things that we can do that allow people to have it their way; whatever 
they wish." That means appealing to people of all ages, genders and 
life styles. Interestingly, Bushnell feels that the technology to 
enable him to capture the "inclusive" feel is within our grasp. Within 
10 years he reckons that the typical home will be connected to the 
Internet at 1Mb per second (or more) and that PCs will have evolved 
away from from 'computers' and into 'systems' that are much easier to 
use. Overall, he sees a move away from 'deskware' and towards 
'couchware'.

After Nolan Bushnell has gone we're left with the feeling that  a) this 
man has obviously given a lot of interviews, and  b) he sure as hell 
knows what he's talking about. Having collected  our thoughts and 
belongings we leave the room and see him again,  over by one of the 
stands having a sneeky peek at Activision's  Hyperblade - a game that 
(in the bif scheme of things) isn't really  that far from Pong. What 
goes around, comes around.
