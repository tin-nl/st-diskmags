…DBE Tracker Preview 

(32-Channel Music Mayhem for your STe!)

This is probably the first attempt to take the tracker/ modfile composer 
market on the STe to the sort of elevated heights only attained by users 
of Falcons and PC's.. DBE is the first serious attempt to squeeze 32 
channels of sound out of the humble old STe!! This tracker can run with 
just about any Atari series machine with an STe type DMA chip, thus 
taking in Mega STe's, TT and Falcon, although we did not have a TT to 
test this assumption out on..

There are certain reservations and qualifications that will become 
clearer as the preview goes on, but first, what of the package itself..

The demo version disk was supplied by Effect PDL, the disk considerately 
came with several sample S3M modules to try out.. This compensated for 
the fact that this demo version of DBE was not particularly Falcon 
friendly, refusing to run from the desktop, and needing 'Backwards' to 
boot the disk from scratch.. Running a depacker through it found that 
the dreaded Atomic 3.5 had been used, but repacking with another more 
Falcon compatible packer, killed the program altogether.. Still, we must 
do what we can.. 

There were various .doc files in English and French,, including a 
.README message from Effect PDL, Mr Tronic himself which had an 
intriguing punchline that went thus;
  ____________________________________________________________________
  You can have my isolation,  you can have the hate that it brings!!!!

Err, thanks for the offer John, but we'll leave that one with you for 
now..

Anyway, it was to Backwards that I turned, and soon enough, there was 
the front end for DBE in my sight.. At first appearance, DBE is another 
Protracker style interface, with the controls dominating the top half of 
the screen, the note displayer/input area sitting at the bottom, and 
arranged in patterns of four columns and 64 notes, entered in 
hexadecimal fashion in the time honoured manner ever since the first 
Amiga Noise Tracker program was produced back in the late 'eighties. The 
interface is slightly less slick looking than something like Protracker, 
but it does the job..

One important difference is the presence of a couple of extra buttons 
which allow you scroll over the number of extra channels made 
available.. An eight channel mod gives you access to channels 5-8, more 
will take you further across the screen, making editing and composing 
multichannel music a real possibility on the STe.. This demo version 
tends to have things like 'Save' disabled, but the finished version will 
support its own proprietary modfile format for composition and file 
export purposes.. 

The list of what it can load in is impressive too, taking in standard 
four channel .MOD, Octalyser and Fast Tracker 6 and 8 channel MODs, 
.669. .MTM, and even .S3M.. The final version will also support the 
Falcon specific Digital and Graoumf module formats..

Well this sounds all fine and dandy, but as you might expect, not 
everything is perfect in paradise.. If you are dealing with a bog-
standard STe as your base hardware, the 'something' that would have to 
give, would be the sound quality.. Very simply, the more sound channels 
used, the worse the sound quality.. On testing on an STe, 8 channel 
replay came up at a listenable quality, say 12.5 khz.. Getting above 
that rapidly drops down what is coming out of your speakers.. People 
with higher rated processors, say Mega STe's or TT's should get a better 
khz replay with higher numbers of sound channels, Falcon owners 
certainly do, even if this tracker does not use the DSP..

Replay quality, especially on some of the more complex modfile types, is 
uneven as well.. Basic four channel Protracker it managed with no 
problem.. It coped, on the whole with Octalyser and Fast Tracker type 
tunes, although some of the samples on the 'Lost Blubb' module sounded 
like lead weights had been attached to their scrotums, slightly 
strained, in other words.. Screamtracker (S3M) implementation was about 
two-thirds of the way there, with some effects sounding decidely off-
key..

Another noteworthy point is that the more memory there is available, the 
better DBE likes it.. On a lot of the bigger tunes, DBE complains if you 
are running a 1 meg system.. Two megabytes and above is much better for 
it..

At the time this demo version was produced, several things were promised 
for this tracker, there was going to be a sample editor, MIDI input, 16 
bit sample replay for the Falcon, with a possible DSP assisted version 
as well.. It would be interesting to find out if this tracker has 
progressed as the author intended it to.. 

Conclusion: From my own experience of the preview/demo, it does not 
offer an awful lot to Falcon owners, who already have access to better 
alternatives.. Things may have changed with newer versions though.. On 
the other hand, STe owners, and people with a similar level of sound 
hardware (TT's et al) may well have something well worth checking out..
