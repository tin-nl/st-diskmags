        Christmas time.  What does it mean  to you, eh?  It's the time
when we get together with  distant  relatives  that we hate and invite
some dodgy beardy bloke into our house to trip over the cat, fall into
the fire and  burn  to  death,  all  for  the  reason  of leaving some
presents for the little ones.

        Only that doesn't happen at all.  Mr beardy is infact a bit of
an imposter and never really existed  in the first place, which hardly
helps restore any faith in our parents, does it?  Lying buggers.

        Of course, the distant relative bit  is spot on, even though I
fail to see why we should use Christmas as an excuse to pretend to get
on with people.  If you hate  someone,  tell them, that's my motto and
at least you can get on with  your  lives then, leaving much more time
to get on with other things.

        Speaking of which, what things can  you  be getting on with in
the time of  joyus  celebrations?   Well,  let  me  tell  you, in this
stunnin' list-o Chrimbo things to do:


Dashing through the snow,  on  a  one  horse  open sleigh, here's some
Christmas things to do, waha-ha-ha-hey.......

 *      Hold your breath until you turn  white  and then run around in
the snow without being noticed.

 *      Break-dance with someone who's got rigor mortis.

 *      Go into a retirement home and paint all the old folk different
colours to assist the staff in  telling  them appart.  For even easier
reference, place a colour chart and legend on the wall.

 *      Have a beard for a day.  How?  Well, don't go about the timely
process of growing one,  instead  gather  together  magnets of various
sizes, pack them into your mouth,  then  press  face into pile of iron
filings.  Hey Presto!  A beard!

 *      Crash car, then lay on road and pretend to be injured.

 *      Stand outside an electrical shop's window display and dance to
the big, flashing lights.

 *      Wait until this new œ16  billion  EuroJet is made, locate it's
place of storage, travel there, sneek  in, then whip it's radio antena
while the owners are asleep.

 *      Kill Chris Evans.  Kill Chris Evans.  Kill Chris Evans.

 *      Drip candle wax onto the body  of a sleeping person until they
are totally immersed.  When they  awake,  shake  a  rodent at them and
sing: "Rats like wax, wax likes  rats,  you  are gonna need new kecks.
With a rim-ram nibble nibble  wick-a-lot-a-wax,  rats like wax and wax
likes rats."

 *      Start your own Saturday morning  kids  TV show, with cartoons,
crap presenters and lovable mascot, Edd the Giblet.

 *      Climb into the freezers at  Asda  and  start throwing the fish
fingers everywhere, shouting:  "RUN, YOU'RE FREE,  I SAY - BACK TO THE
OCEAN WITH YOU."

 *      Walk into WHSmiths, que for ten  minutes, then ask girl behind
counter whether they sell  postage  stamps.   When  she tells you that
they do, say "oh" and walk out.

 *      BE Mark Morrison in  three  easy  steps:  1.  Wear big, golden
chains and thick rings at  all  times.   2.  Dip  head in large pot of
Superglue and put sunglasses and hat on.  Now they will never come off
and will make you look tuff  'n'  cool  each  and every day.  3. Carry
handcuffs around with you  everywhere  and  show  them to everyone you
meet.  If you can't get any handcuffs, write "I WAS ONCE IN PRISON" on
your forehead, so that everyone  knows  and  thinks that you are hard.
Congratulations, you are now Mark Morrison.

 *      Avenge a cod fillet.

 *      Take a Ressusi-Annie first aid doll out for a dirty weekend.

 *      Build a really high wall and  watch planes crash into it.  Put
a net below to collect  all  the  pieces.  Have competitions with your
friends to see who can collect the biggest aircraft.

 *      Climb inside a coffee machine, wait until someone inserts some
money, then spit phelm  at  them  through  the  little hole that gives
change.

 *      Nick an old person's walking stick and taunt him with it.

 *      Go and kick the shite  out  of  a Frence person for supporting
the testing of nuclear weapons.

 *      Get really drunk on a Tuesday  night  and sleep with an animal
you have never even met before.

 *      I was joking.  Really.

 *      Save money on paying out for expensive watches and jewelery by
buying a pack of felt tip pens, then drawing your desired form of body
decor on your arms, wrists,  fingers,  neck, ecetera.  If your partner
asks for  jewelery  as  a  christmas  present,  draw  on  her/him with
permanant marker.

 *      Sellotape some people to a wall and charge passers by money to
pull faces at them.

 *      Smash up a scooter for being shit.

 *      Get ST+ each and every month, 'cos  it  is good and I am in it
and stuff.

 *      Hey girls!  BE one of the  girlies  from Shampoo in three easy
steps:  1.  Talk  complete  drivel  whenever  you  make  a  televisual
appearance.  2. Dye your hair a silly  colour and dress as if you were
going to a 'club,  but  accidentally  got  dragged backwards through a
hedge on the way there, not to  show  that you're untidy but to make a
really good personal statement about how you dress.    3. NEVER smile.
Congratulations, you are now one of  the  birds from Shampoo.  Fancy a
shag, joke.

 *      Eat a mongoose without ketchup.

 *      Invent a new colour and give it  a name that only dolphins can
hear.

 *      Stick a ferret down an  American's trousers because that's all
that they think we do in our spare time, anyway.

 *      Walk into a fishmongers  and  say:   "Anybody  got any salmon?
Salt it." Walk out again.

 *      Dress up as Father Christmas, travel  to a Co-op store, locate
the grotto,  go  inside  and  beat  up  the  Santa  already  in there,
shouting:  "Get out of my home, arsehole."


*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/
        Look.  Look up  there.   Just  above  us  now.   That's almost
Christmas tinsel,  that  is.   Anyway,  now  with  all  the  amazingly
brilliant things to do over Christmas, the new year should bring a new
and special slant to your lives, once again.
        That is all there is left to  say, as I desperately attempt to
flesh out a final paragraph  in  the  doubtful hope of sounding slick.
Better leave it there then.  Have a nice life.
