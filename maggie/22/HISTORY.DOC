The year that was...A review of 1996 

by Dave Hollis for Maggie 22

 So, as 1996  draws to a close  maybe it's time to ponder over what 
has happened over the last 12 months....from my perspective that is.

 --------------

 I've  never pretended to be in the know when it comes to the Atari 
scene, I like to think however I have enough contax to keep informed 
however, some things were unavoidably apparent like the merger of 
Atari to the J.T.S. corporation.

 With the collapse of our 'founding father' the Atari scene is (quote) 
'as dead as it's gonna be', that said there are still loads of 
applications, programs, games and misc utilities and diskzines STILL 
comming into the light.

 It's a forgone conclusion that various games, utilities ect. will 
have been released throughout the year however, to keep this doc 
reasonably readable I've opted to go for only the more 'important' 
developements.
 
 In what' turned out to be a funny ol' year things seems to have taken 
a turn for the better, if you ignore the fact that distribution rights 
to various different products seem to have changed hands on more than 
one occasion  you'll see  that  over  the last  year the  Atari scene 
has grownstronger, after a long absence it would seem that companies 
are now advertising ST games again (16/32 to name just one) and I 
don't mean the 'odd' game, I'm talking about an apprieciable amount of 
differing titles. What about Atari Computing?, surely not the result 
of a useless platform, issue two's print run was in excess of three 
times that of issue one. Titan, System Soloutions, Goodmans int, 
Floppyshop and many other companies are STILL releasing Atari 
products....I for one have spent more on my STE over the last 6 months 
that I had over the previous 3 years, is this an act of stupidity...I 
think not but time will tell.

 Before I continue I'll make it clear that I couldn't have compiled 
this little file without the help of Atari Computing and ST Format, 
flicks through their hallowed pages allowed me to cover as much as 
possible so thanx must partly go to them, also my thanx to everyone 
who has helped me out by increasing my overall Atari knowledge over 
the months. That said, let's have a look from January onwards...

Å
January
                                 --------

 The Jaguar VR headset  was put on hold indefinitely due to 
conflicting interests, although Atari still maintain there will be a 
VR set.

 System Solutions release major update to Ease (the replacement 
desktop).

 ST+ was launched into an unsuspecting world, with tips from various 
folks like CiH, Tony Greenwood and numerous others this promised to be

 Compo acquired  distribution rights to the then new Falcon 
Afterburner accelerator board.
Å
February
                                 --------

                                   -----

 The Atari corporation merged with JTS, a hard drive manufacturer, 
after months of speculation, though most of the world thinks that 
Atari is dead, I myself think otherwise, IF Atari have a 60% share in 
JTS, as was  alleged then surely we will see more Atari/JTS products 
in the future, after all, it takes more than a  few months to conceive 
and develop new products huh?...I might be wrong but....

latest titles, 6 speed IDE CD ROM kit for the Atari also adds to the 
ongoing 'battle'.

 More news on the Falcon doom clone, Bad Mood, is also released, the 
project was reported to be going 'very well'.

 The price of the Jaguar in the US was dropped dramatically to only 
$49 in selected US retails outlets, rumours are rife that the Jag's

                                   ----

organise plans for a forthcoming Atari show,.

 Titan Designs took over as  official distributor for the Afterburner

                                  ------

 Contrary to popular belief some games are still being developed for 
the Jaguar, WORMS, from Team 17, won many awards including most

After weeks of speculation, long running newstand publication ST 
Format finally closes its doors due to misleading sales figures, a 
very fast exit for the U.K.'s (to some) best Atari zine. Although STF 
pulled out of the sponsorship deal with Goodmans the Autumn Atari 
shows in September were to still go ahead.

Å
 September
                                 ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ

to become a winner the pages will be updateable with a minimum of 
fuss.

 A much larger than expected number of people attend the Atari shows 
on the 28th and 29th, so many turned up in fact that the very next 
week's rumour was rife of a second Atari show, rumours that ultimately 
became fact with new shows planned for April and May 1997.

 With STF gone the way was clear for another paper publication, this 
came in the shape of Atari Computing, launched at the Autumn Atari 
Shows and headed by Joe Connor and Mike Kerslake this promises to be 
one that stays around for a while (provided I don't blummin jinx 'em 
by saying so;-)).. Effectively breathing new life into the Atari scene 
Atari Computing has requested heavy reader interaction and 
contributions. I like to think that we're going  through a small 
revival..... Let's hope it continues.


Å
 October
                                 -------
 Titan/Black Scorpion officially announce their latest art package, 
Apex 3.

also Cubase CD ROM also becomes available and a new CD 'burning' 
service is offered allowing you to clear hard drive space.

November
                                 --------

 System Solutions import the Hades, the most powerful Atari clone to 
date.

 The Falcon accelerator, the NEMESIS card almost makes it into the 
real world, boasting some stunning qualities and a blistering pace, it 
looks set to become a sell out. Also Titan are testing a new software 
screen expander for the Falcon called VIDELITY.

 A French web browser is set to take up arm with CAB, set to arrive 
soon only time will tell if it has enough power to topple the so far, 
only decent web browser. Initial reports suggest that the new 
contender might be a tad unstable to start with.

 Papyrus 4 also makes it onto the stage, rewritten from the off, it 
looks set to take the Atari scene by storm.

 Yet another Atari clone from Centek tentatively titled the Phenix 
will soon become available, coming from France this promises to outdo 
even the mighty Hades and Medusa.

ÅDecember
                                 --------

Nemesis becomes available (fitting service provided). The DIY versions 
are still awaiting their manuals, although Titan are confident that 
these should be delivered by Christmas.

 Well, here we are, December, ST+ shortly celebrates it's first 
birthday (and this time you're NOT invited to our party...you didn't 
come to our other one did you?), I really can't see anything MAJOR  
happening over the next two or three weeks but then....you never know 
with the ATARI DO YOU...

 And, there you have it, 1996 from an Atari users perspective, most of 
you will have noticed that Titan and System Solutions go a few 
mentions, well, why not, at this time they're doing great work for the 
Atari scene by releasing some impressive amounts of software and 
Hardware. I know I can speak for us all when I say 'roll on 1997', 
with more ATARI SHOWS PLANNED, MORE FROM aTARI computing and much more 
besides....

     My thanx once more to all who helped in compiling this file.
