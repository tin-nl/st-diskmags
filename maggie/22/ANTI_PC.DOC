Ñ                        Poetry Corner Guest Spot!



In a true scoop for Maggie's now-infamous "Poetry Corner", recent 
nominee for the Nobel Prize for Literature, Bob Dylan (we kid you 
not!) has decided to give his most recent unpublished works to this 
esteemed organ. He was said to be "extremely impressed" at the quality 
of previous issues, and expressed his disfavour with the ex-head of 
Atari. He's obviously not a man to buy a used car off.

In his 60s heyday, Bobby (as he is known to his friends) was never one 
to shirk controversy. Here he has decided to again tackle one of the 
biggest issues of contemporary culture.... with his "tribute" to the 
classic John Lennon song:



                     ÅTHE BALLAD OF BILL AND BOZO
            (c) R. Zimmerframe 1996. All rights reserved.

Ñ(To be sung in style of a droning folk-singer/computer-lover)
ÅBOZO:
                Oh Bill, I really love your stuff!
                I fear I cannot get enough,
                And though it really costs me dear,
                I always buy your newest gear.

                Windows NT's my latest must,
                Although the server's always bust,
                Installing apps is such a pain,
                But still I buy this crap again.

                So tell me Bill, what can I do?
                I'm really so in love with you.
                And though you always treat wrong,
                I'd even buy your "MS-Pong"!
ÅBILL:
                Hush sweet one, no need to weep,
                (I do admit the pricing's steep,
                But if you buy a new PC,
                A mate would give it you for free!)

                But listen now, I need you too,
                For even despite OS/2,
                With you around I'll have no cares,
                Although sane people hate my wares.

                Not for you the lovely Mac,
                Instead you go to hell and back,
                Crashing Windows all the time,
                Protection errors wait in line.

                With fools like you I need no others,
                (Interested in new dust covers?)
                You forgive my idle blunders,
                For you "Office" is the Eighth wonder.

                So come on Bozo, sing along,
                Come join me in my "MS-Song"* .....

ÅLEGAL NOTE ENDS

ÅBILL AND BOZO Ñ(together in chorus):
                For one another made are we,
                E'er since the days of Windows 3
                Explorer good and NetScape bad,
                You never know when you've been had.

                Come let us click, and click and click,
                With all the others who are thick,
                And waste our hours, mouse in hand,
                And spread our bugs throughout the land.

ÅBOZO:           Bill Gates, I will never see the end,
                Of Windows sending me round the bend,
                I love it when you treat me so,
                Of no better way do I know.

                So tell me Bill, what can I do?
                To show my undivided love for you?
ÅBILL:           Have no fear, here's Windows 2!
                For ninety bucks it's here for you,

                And if some diskspace you do lack,
                Five hundred copies out the back,
                And soon no longer will I bitch,
                Five billion more and I'll be rich!

Ñ[Repeat chorus to fade.]
