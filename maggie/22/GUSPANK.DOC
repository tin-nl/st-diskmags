Bryan Adams loathing corner returns!

It's official, and well overdue.. The following revealing extract from 
'Slipped Disks - The Worst Rock'n'Roll Records of all Time' (Virgin 
Books 1991) gives a rather useful 45th place to that great wasteland of 
Bryan Adams inspired vinyl "Summer of '69" (A&M Records, 1985)..

(Why only 45th place? Could it be that there were records even worse 
then this one!!)

Anyway, to follow with the words of the good book itself..

Bryan Adams' derivitiveness is rivalled only by his opportunism. Before 
he went platinum in 1983 with the album 'Cuts like a Knife' and single 
'Straight from the Heart' (did we mention that all his titles and ideas 
are cliches?) the Candadian singer tried everything - from the blandest 
pop to the most unfunky disco - to make it big. If there's anything 
that unites Adams' broad fumbling attempts for fame, it's their 
consistent falseness. You never believe a word Adams sings or a note he 
writes because he's just as likely as not to undercut it with the next 
song or the next line. Finding him on the radio is like discovering a 
mosquito buzzing in your ear; you quickly swat him away, but you know 
sometime soon you're going to have to deal with him again.

The most bogus, most derivative, most opportunistic song Adams has ever 
thrown at us is 'Summer of '69', from his mannered 1984 album 
'Reckless'. The nostalgia of the song ("When I look back now.. those 
were the best days of my life") quickly turns to petulance, and the one 
guitar riff that propels the song (Chuck Berry filtered through a Bruce 
Springsteen, filtered through John Cafferty, filtered through a beer 
commercial) gets boring long before you've heard it for the hundredth 
time (somewhere in the second verse). You've heard it all before, done 
better. The song is about a singer's first band, how intense the 
moments with the band were, and how the group broke up when one member 
quit, and another got married. For the record, Adams was ten years 
old in 1969; it took him a while to admit that the song wasn't 
autobiographical. (C'mon, Bryan; even Jerry Lee wouldn't marry a ten-
year old, and you're more uptight than he'll ever be.)

'Summer of '69' appeared just after sixties nostalgia crested and 
everyone from the Doors to the Hollies were enjoying the fruits of 
rediscovery. The sixties nostalgia that sprung up in the mid-eighties 
was a fraud by industry leaders who refused to divulge to a new 
generation that the unmatchable music was inextricable from the 
horrible events that split the USA in two as nothing had since the 
Civil War. Instead, culturally uneducated kids were made to hear songs 
like Martha and the Vandellas' "Dancing in the Streets" and the 
Rolling Stones "Street Fighting Man" as no more than party ditties.

It's this imagined sixties - one without Vietnam, one without James 
Earl Ray, one without Altamont - that "Summer of '69" memoralises. Even 
if the song isn't autobiographical, (fine by us, we couldn't care less 
about Bryan's childhood) it has to sound like someone's real life. 

Adams's ideas about the sixties are at least third hand, he can't make 
the time real for himself, so forget about his making it real for us 
through his songs.
