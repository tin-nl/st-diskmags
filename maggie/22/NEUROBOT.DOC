  NEUROBOTIX is a high-tech platformer. You control the weird looking 
robot in the middle of the screen. Your objective is to reach the end 
of each level with losing as little energy as possible. There also are 
a load of nasty robo-idiots in the level that like to shoot at you and 
take your precious energy. 

  Some enemy-droids are pretty lame and slow and therefore are pretty 
easy to kill. Others however are much more aggressive, impulsive and 
even a bit smart. Sometimes you will need all your wits to get past the 
robots spread throughout the levels. In the first levels you will only 
be confronted with lame drones and only a few slow tanks. The later 
levels contain much more robo-scum, though. But I'm not telling you 
about them. You will just have to find out yourself. 

  I think you all know what this game is all about. It's about you 
blasting the hell out of everything that moves. Well, it's not as 
simple as that, because there are loads of weapons to pick up and you 
also have to do a lot searching to reach the exit. Sometimes it's not 
about YOU killing enemies either. It's more about THEM kicking your 
ass. 

If you like this game and play it frequently I would like you to send 
me a donation. Something like 5UKP or 10DM is quite reasonable. Don't 
send cheques please, I only accept paper money. In return you'll get a 
newsletter from me and some Falcon-demo-FX. Remember to give your 
address and stuff too! 

  I have worked about two years to complete this game and I would like 
some response and a bit of money to buy new soft- and hardware with. I 
got plenty of kicks from coding this game, but I think I need more. I 
need your REGISTRATIONS!!! It would be nice if I got more than 15 
registrations. You know it is fair to register. If I don't get enough 
registrations people will only laugh at me and I will surely stop 
making quality shareware for the Falcon. It all depends on YOU!!! 

  When you decide to register you can: 
   - suggest bugfixes which I will then implement. 
   - suggest ideas for new games/demos/proggies. 

You will also get a disk with stuff as stated above.
Enough said about shareware and on with the normal stuff...  
This game will only work on a: 

- FALCON030 WITH: 
  - 4 MB OR MORE 
  - A JOYSTICK 
  - A RGB- OR VGA-MONITOR (TV works too if it can handle 60 Hz!)

If you have a ST or TT this game will simply return to the desktop. If 
you have a B/W-monitor hooked up to your Falcon030 the same will 
happen. 

Well, you can send your registrations to the following address:
Pieter van der Meer 
Bereklauw 1 
4102 KZ Culemborg 
Netherlands

People, if you want to ask something or just have a chat about 
computers you can always contact me at this address. By the way: does 
someone want to team up with me. I'd like to create loads of cool 
demo's and/or games. If you're an Atari-freak and live in Holland don't 
hesitate to write. People who just like my game and would like to give 
a me a bigger donation than the 5 quid, please send me a can of beer. 
You will get my eternal gratitude. 

  Yeah, that sounds nice. Maybe my next game will be BEERWARE!!!! 
yEaH!! I love beer, you know. You can do all sorts of things with it. 
You can drink it and if you drink too much beer you can puke it. You 
can use beer as a diuretic (It makes you pee like an elephant!!). You 
can use beer as a hair-gel. The beer-bottles can be used for molotov-
coctails and broken ones can be used as assaultweapons. 

  Let's get on with some more sensible things, shall we. I like coding 
for the Atari. It's comfortable and powerful. I like coding demo-FX 
best. Games are nice to code too, but they require so much comitment 
and long work that I simply need more than the kick provided by coding. 
I need your reactions! Right now I feel like nobody understands why I'm 
coding games for the Falcon. If nobody reacts I will surely stop this 
"nonsence". Please don't let this happen. YOU, the Falcon-owners, will 
probably find what I'm doing useful. With your reactions I can 
continue. Please register.... 

  Enough idealistic chat for now... I'm currently working on a high 
quality RPG for the Falcon. Some routines have already been coded and 
some graphics have been drawn too. It will be better than ISHAR. I can 
assure you! This automaticly means that it will be a cosmic amount of 
work too. I'm still open to your reactions, though. If you'd like me to 
code somekind of game, just say so. 

  At the moment I'm still doing my education. It will take 4 years for 
me to finish it and only then can I fully concentrate on coding and 
designing stuff. I have many ideas for games and demos. So many in fact 
that it's like my head almost exploding. To avoid this I need to code 
something every week. Mostly these are only a few routines. If only I 
could find a way to use this urge to code more effectively. Then I 
would surely create very cool stuff. 

  But whatever the case Me aNd My aSsEmBLeR BE ReAdY!!! Ofcourse my 
little sister will create a few graphics for my next game. THEY WILL BE 
EYE-POPPING !!!! Just wait and see....

BUT NOW,
HAVE FUN AND REGISTER,
