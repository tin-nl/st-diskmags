HI!!  I read your mag with great pleasure... but I have few "things to
say" .)  the only thing that bothers me is the fact that I cant read
articles during magic session, or when running usual set with 
blowup..etc.

So I wrote a little gem shell, which make that possible... but (always 
that word)there are some changes to be made: u have text in one file, 
but for my shell is more apropriate that texts are in files..

BTW my shell can only display text in window, for gfx mpegs... uses 
external viewers..such as apex's ones... the menu settings may be made 
in minutes! Anyhow, I am pleased with your mag, and please, keep doing 
good for ATARI!       

Sincerely, Janez Valant

P.S. excuse me for my english


„A Maggie Replies..

Hi there and thanks Janez, the offer of a menu shell is nice, but we're 
all up to our frontal lobes in menu shell programs as it is.. I think 
you are referring to the rather tasty whizz-bang Falcon menu, well that 
is deliberately designed to be as far away from being a GEM program as 
possible, as is our separate Delta Force originated ST menu shell, 
which is also very unlikely to run with MagiC either.. 

Interestingly, the GEM system you proposed sounds a lot like the old 
Falcon Update Digital menu, which was GEM based, and also pulled in 
external viewers such as the APEX ones to display a picture, play 
animations etc.. You might have a problem with the pictures, which are 
grabbed directly from source and stored in a proprietary format unique 
to that shell menu, also, everything is heavily compressed, also we 
like to play some music whilst the rest of Maggie is going on, and have 
a decent multi-channel sound engine that would take some replacing if 
we were to take up your offer.. From experience, the Apex picture 
viewers directly use the DSP and are not too happy to have to share it 
with a module player anyway.. 

So you see, we're quite happy with things as they are on the menu shell 
front, but thanks for offering anyway..

(Having said all of that though, there does seem to be an increasing 
level of demand for PC-based emulators and replacement operating 
systems such as MagiC.. Does anyone else feel a need for a version of 
Maggie with a GEM style shell that is ultra system legal, or are you 
happy with things just as they are?? I'm not going to promise anything 
at this stage, but give me your views on this one..) 

BTW, which issue of Maggie was it that you read? We have released two 
issues in a fairly short space of time, issue 20 in July, and issue 21 
most recently at the end of September

On a more general note, thanks for reading and enjoying our mag, and 
feel free to keep us up to date with what you and your local Atari 
scene are doing at the moment..

    Regards

        CiH

Hi you guys at diskmaggie,

I'm a 18 year old Dutch falcon coder. I've had an atari since I was 
10 and have never had a PC, amiga or other crappy machines. Two 
months ago I got internet access. Till then I knew only little about 
the Atari-scene.

    Last week I downloaded your diskmagazine. It really amazed me how 
cool your mag was. Now I know loads more about the scene and most 
importantly the people behind it. Diskmaggie is informative, 
enthousiastic and most importantly fun. I really loved those 
beautifull poems about Alistair Bodin ;).

   I myself have just completed my Falcon game. I spent 1300 working-
hours coding it. I've included it in this message. I hope you like 
it. At the moment I'm working on a 3d-shoot em 'up. The routines I 
have are already pretty fast and flexible. Expect to see some 3d-
spaceships from me soon... I'm open to suggestions for software too.

    Maybe you could review my game. I would really appreciate some 
fame in the scene(and maybe some registrations too). Maybe you could 
interview me too, because I'm a really K3wl bloke. (No, honestly!)
I'd like to write some stuff for your magazine. Maybe some details 
about coding or something like that.

Stay cool, stay Atari!

GreetZ,

P.S. Where do those DBA-guys live. I'm Dutch but I've never met them.

A Maggie replies..

„By the time this issue of Maggie 'hits the streets', you should 
hopefully be in receipt of a reply from us in the form of a back issue 
of Maggie 20 which contains a preview of Neurobotix, (with screengrab) 
a small matter of a registration fee (5 UKP is very reasonable) and 
probably a Christmas card, as it is that festive time of year..  If any 
of these are missing at all, hit your postman with a wooden spoon!!

You've made several offers, all of which are very interesting.. We're 
debating doing a full review of Neurobotix as we are heavily 
oversubscribed for game reviews already for this issue.. And this on a 
supposedly 'dead' system!! However, we're quite happy to put some kind 
of advertisement for Neurobotix in Maggie 22, probably based on the 
.doc file that came with the game and probably with another screengrab, 
if space permits.. Hopefully, the registrations will follow from 
there..

Interview, yes, but not just yet, as we've booked a not totally unknown 
ex diskmag editing Dutchman called Richard Karsmakers to appear with 
various others this time around, but a dead certainty for next issue 
(Maggie 23).. A suitable questionnaire will follow up in the new year.. 

Other articles, especially of a coding related nature, yes please!! Our 
resident assembly gurus Leon, (Mr Pink/RG) and Tat would appreciate a 
new face.. Again, probably something to be developed for the issue 
after this one, unless you have any spare articles going unused right 
now??

Also looking forward to any 3-D spaceships, one thing the Falcon is 
*very* short of, is 3-D spaceships and ways to make them explode in 
front of your eyes.. You'd make a long-time 'Elite' fan extremely happy 
indeed, and I look forward to seeing more of this new game.. I also 
seem to remember something about demo code in the game documentation as 
well.. Any more info on that one?? 

To wrap up for now, its people like you that make producing this 
diskmag totally worthwhile!!

Keep it clean, keep it Atari!!

Ta mate and seeya soon..

Chris H..


Covering both the Postscripts..

The DBA Team are from the northern part of Holland, the metropolis of 
Drachten springs to mind.. DBA mag is a bit poorly at the minute due to 
main man Slimer dropping out of the scene.. Yes indeed, the Seeenyor 
Dadz do indeed rule!!

Well first I would like to say thanks for publishing my email in Maggie
20.  Every bloody word of it.  Especially the  "Dads" bit.  Yes- thanks
very  bloody  much indeed.  Anyway,  I've learned this brilliant phrase 
called "off the record",  which I might be using once or twice from now
on- watch out for it.

Anyway the main point of this email is that I've found a site you might
be  interested  in- something by  the  name  of  "Dead Celebrities"  at
http://www1.shore.net/~cbo/ , which I found by way of Cruel Site of the
Day at  http://www.cruel.com/ ,  a site which I found out  about  after 
they  decided  to award one of my pages as  "Cruel Site of the day"  on 
Dec 4 1996. So there you go...

Yes,  you  can  publish all of this email.  Oh by the way, can you give 
this message to Leon- 

HIDE THE EXPLOSIVES! INTERPOL ARE GETTING SUSPICIOUS!

Michael.

Hmm, we've learned a brilliant new phrase too.. It goes something like 
"Shrrblluskmasshh" (-HIC!-) which we use quite often as well.. 
Especially on those long winter nights where we start to see three of 
everything.. On the subject of 'Cruel Sites', we might have one or two 
more suggestions, The Sad Daily Mail Journalists 'fings 'aint wot they 
used ter be' corner, for a good example, The Michael Jackson 'Playmate 
of the month' page (!?) perhaps? (With 'Death by Libel Lawyer' to follow 
v. shortly afterwards?)

(Aha, but it's not been made to stand up in court yet!! - Mr Knowitall)

Oh and we *loved* the new Senior Daddzz demo to bits, my favourite bit 
was the music and the animation at the end! Keep up the *brilliant* work 
mate, and pass on my best wishes to the other dads!!

Oh, and I've passed your final message on to Leon, has he still got that 
old ex-Soviet tactical nuclear warhead kicking around as well.. These 
things do suffer from component decay and 'pop' of their own accord 
occasionally if left alone for too long, so I've told him to look into 
the aftercare and routine maintenance aspects if he's still got it, and 
I believe he is now trying to source a suitable English language 
instruction manual which was always a bit of a sod to find at the best 
of times.. Might be a bit easier now as there are some decent car boot 
sales where you can pick up these sort of things quite cheaply..

Cheers again..

Chris
