Nemesis - Video enhancement as standard! 
---------------------------------------- 
Following tests performed on Nemesis, we have been able to achieve some 
incredible true-colour video resolutions with Nemesis running at 
24/48MHz.

This is only possible due to the massive 50% increase on the Falcon bus 
to 24MHz. Running Nemesis at 20/40MHz does produce lower figures, 
although 576x432 @ 60Hz refresh is still possible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Falcon with Nemesis at 24/48MHz - all are non-interlaced resolutions, 
16-bit (65,536 colours per screen) on a standard 14" VGA non-multisync!
With a half-decent multi-sync it can be expected that even higher 
resolutions can be seen!

                CPU          Video  Refresh 
                Bus    CPU    Bus    (Hz) 
640x480          24     24     24      60 
720x528          24     24     24      50
576x432          20     20     20      60

In addition you would also benefit from 48MHz (or 40MHz depending on 
the Nemesis settings) acceleration to FPU and DSP chips. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primarily these tests were performed to check the outer resolution 
limits when using APEX Alpha (APEX 3). The software which has been 
developed (see the news on 'Videlity' below) to achieve these 
resolutions is expected to become commercially available in due course, 
and will have the capability to alter screen resolutions for any number 
of bit-planes (mono to true-colour inclusive).
 
Nemesis - Reliable, consistent 24MHz system speed! 
-------------------------------------------------- 
While even standard Falcons can be unreliable with DMA transfer, 
further tests with Nemesis have revealed that a 24MHz bus can be 
achieved, reliably and consistently, without any problems of this 
nature.

Having a regular 24MHz bus is increasingly important if the user wishes 
to use the higher resolutions (720x528 true-colour) that only Nemesis 
can give!
 
Nemesis - Totally 'crackle-free' 50KHz playback! 
----------------------------------------------------- 
Another advantage of having reliable DMA has been totally clean 50KHz 
sound playback. To the best of our knowledge, no other accelerator can 
claim to have a 24MHz system speed, reliable DMA or clean 50KHz 
playback.
 
Nemesis - Major APEX MEDIA enhancement 
-------------------------------------- 
Just when you thought it was safe to go in the water...

APEX Media has been updated yet again. Now it is possible to have a 
full 640x480 TRUE-COLOUR screen display when used with Nemesis at 
24/48MHz!

Although a slow-down in performance would normally be expected at this 
resolution, we have found that the speed is comparable (if not better) 
than with APEX Media at 640x480, 256-colour! Again, the Nemesis 24MHz 
system speed is responsible for counter-acting the expected decrease in 
performance one would expect with high-res. true-colour.

Although the increase in screen size means a large chunk of memory is 
now consumed, the full 640x480, true-colour resolution is still 
perfectly possible on a "Nemesised" 4MB Falcon, although (obviously!) 
animations become restricted.
 
VIDELITY - Superb resolution enhancement software 
------------------------------------------------- 
Videlity was originally developed to support APEX Alpha for creating 
high resolution displays, and will therefore be supplied with this 
program to form part of the complete software/hardware suite - APEX 
Alpha, Videlity and Nemesis.

We also expect Videlity to become a "must have" option, particularly 
for Nemesis owners but also for users having a standard Falcon.

Videlity provides extremely reliable resolution switching and fixes 
many bugs that are apparent in TOS, including some anomalies that seem 
to exist in NVDI.

Rather than be constrained by fixed resolution settings which are 
apparent in other screen expanders, Videlity allows fast operation and 
complete flexibility in all operations.

Price has yet to be decided when sold separately but, as with all BSS 
products, operation will be fast, smooth, glitch-free and with the 
usual superb BSS hallmark for design and integration of the interface.
 
APEX ALPHA (APEX 3) 
------------------- 
APEX 3 is now officially called APEX ALPHA. As has been mentioned 
before, the '3' denotes the development number of this particular APEX 
product.

APEX Alpha was seen publicly for the first time at the Birmingham and 
London shows on 28/29 September and is making great progress. Windows 
can be moved & resized in real-time, with Expose' digitiser support the 
file selector fully implemented.

Unlike Photoline, APEX Alpha (and Audio) operate in a fully customised 
non-GEM environment for optimum speed and reliability, without being 
constrained by the limitations imposed by GEM. Although this limits 
operation to the Atari Falcon only, the extensive use of DSP machine 
coding provides incomparable performance which cannot be duplicated on 
any other TOS based computer.

The ability to create and edit 8-bit Alpha channel masks (256 levels of 
transparency), Chroma-key range masking, multiple filtering, anti-
aliased block operations - all in real-time - puts APEX Alpha way ahead 
of the competition, particularly when the price will only be #99.00. 
This represents a huge saving of #70 over Photoline.

In addition APEX Alpha fully supports the higher true-colour 
resolutions that are available from the Nemesis system accelerator 
without any noticable slow- down in operation. The Videlity resolution 
enhancement software (detailed above), will be packaged as part of the 
APEX Alpha suite to provide control for the enhanced resolution 
capability.

To realise the full capability of APEX Alpha, the purchase of Nemesis 
expands the performance and versatility way beyond the standard 
specification of a standard Atari Falcon.

It is expected that full support will also be included for pressure 
sensitive touch tablets, colour scanners and printers.

Although it is difficult to be specific on a likely completion date, 
progress is accelerating now that the program shell is complete and we 
expect the finished article to be shipping towards the end of the year.
 
APEX AUDIO (APEX 4) 
------------------- 
Following is the first (provisional) specification for APEX Audio;
o Extremely fast real-time DSP operation. 
o Full 24-bit sampling capability. 
o Waveform enhancment technology for high quality audio. 
o Real-time resampling allowing record and playback at any sample rate 
  from  6KHz to 99KHz. 
o Direct-to-Disk sampling. 
o Basic Filtering functions; low pass, high pass, etc. 
o Waveform generation Studio.

In addition, it is possible that MIDI & SCSI sample dumps will be 
included.

Price has yet to be finalised, but APEX Audio is expected to ship 
towards the end of the year. As with APEX Alpha, Audio is at a similar 
stage of completion - the shell of the program is complete and some of 
the operations are already implemented - so a similar rate of progress 
can be expected.

AFTERBURNER040 - Enhanced video resolutions 
-------------------------------------------
As can be expected, Afterburner040 also benefits from having the 
Nemesis system accelerator installed. Not only does this increase the 
overall performance of the system, but enhanced video resolutions are 
also possible.

Falcon with Afterburner040 and Nemesis - all are non-interlaced 
resolutions, 16-bit (65,536 colours per screen) on a standard 14" VGA.
                CPU                 Video  Refresh 
                Bus    CPU    Pipe   Bus    (Hz) 
720x528          12.5   25     50     25      50 
640x480          12.5   25     50     25      60 
576x432          20     40     80     20      50

As with the enhanced Nemesis video resolutions, the Video bus is the 
crucial figure with regard to video performance and increased 
resolutions, not the CPU bus.

Although the Afterburner CPU is being half-clocked in the highest 
resolutions, the actual performance is still much higher than a 
standard Falcon, and is completely switchable between the various 
specifications.

The patches created by Black Scorpion Software to replace the existing 
ones for the Afterburner040 have also been considerably enhanced, and 
are being continually improved.
 
NEW PRINTER TECHNOLOGY - 600x600dpi! 
==================================== 
We are currently assessing a new colour printer which has only just 
been announced and uses new technology called Micro Dry. The 
performance of this printer permits colours resolutions of 600x600dpi 
and, due to the printing process being perfectly dry, allows superb 
photo-realistic reproduction on standard paper, transparencies, Iron-on 
transfers, etc.

When creating plain black print-outs, this remarkable printer will 
produce a laser sharp 1200x600dpi resolution.

Even more remarkable is the fact that true spot metallic colours are 
possible when using special cartridges. The price for the printer is 
expected to be #469.00, with CMYK cartridges costing around #7.95 each 
and the metallic cartridges #9.95 each (Gold, Silver, Cyan and 
Magenta).

It is expected that a printer driver will be created for use with APEX 
Alpha. More news will be provided as and when we receive it.
 
GRIBNIF SOFTWARE - NEW PRICES! 
==============================
NEW PRICE FOR THE GENEVA/NEODESK 4 BUNDLE! 
------------------------------------------ 
Now Titan Designs can bring the complete Geneva/NeoDesk 4 bundle for a 
mere #79.95! The complete multitasking environment for Atari ST/TT and 
Falcon computers, coupled with the latest version of the most popular 
replacement Desktop system has never represented better value.
