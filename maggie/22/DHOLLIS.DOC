Interview for Maggie 22

Dave 'Yahoo' Hollis

Editor of ST+ Diskzine


Okey dokey Dave, this one was coming for a little while, especially now 
you've got a diskmag of substance on the general Atari scene!!!

The editor of ST+ unplugged, unedited, undressed, whatever.. Questions 
and answers to commence now..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave, the general format for answers can be anything from one word 
answers, to a small essay, we prefer the longer replies, as these are 
generally more interesting, but I'll leave it up to you!! - Chris
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
…
What is your full name, including the disgusting middle name bits that 
lurk in there..

 DAVID GEORGE HOLLIS...erm, you may NOT!!! laugh...anyway, blame  my 
mum and dad...after all, they named me, right?.

…Date of birth??

 19th August 1969, August 19th also happens to be the birthday of:-

Gene Roddenberry - Star Trek creator
John Frakes - Cmdr Riker from T.N.G. (I think)
Chris Jenkins - ST+'s resident PD Editor

known and unknown to us, favourite colour of tap water etc..

 I was born......WHAT MORE CAN I SAY..?

..Hmmm, well, o.k. I've been engaged to Mandy, for almost 8 years. We 
have 2 kiddies, one named Kristian (Four Yrs) and one named Kerry-
Leanne (almost one yr), I love 'em both (though I couldn't eat 'em all 
at once....)

 Mandy and I have planned to get married on no less than 4 occasions 
but due to other matters popping up we've STILL not done the honours.

Oh, and my fave colour, erm, Blueackellowregreen....it's a new colour 
that combines...well, all of 'em really.
…
What was your computing career pre-ST??

Oh dear...this is where I have to own up to possessing really crap 
pieces of hardware innit?, well, To start off with I had a VIC 20 with 
a MASSIVE 16k ram expansion cart, this was my first intro to the works 
of Jeff Minter (or was it alan....no, Alan was a boxer...I think), 
well, whoever it was, Gridrunner and Matrix were my all time fave 
games...at the time...

 Then I had a Toshiba MSX for about 2 days  before it blew up, this 
might have been due to me dropping a cup of tea all over it...I can't 
be sure (heh! heh!). Moving ever onwards...to a ZX Spectrum 48K, I 
actually spent quite a lot of time on this baby... Playing games 
unfortunately, the likes of Dizzy came to be part of my everyday 
life.... A swift abode replacement (erm, I moved house) saw my 48k 
'baby' swapped for a 128k...WOW, loadsa ram, pity I still didn't know 
what to do with it.

 Then I found the 'BREAK' key....an amazingly simple bit 'o' hacking 
saw me addicted to a footy manager game untill..... along came the 
Commodore 64 and my first ever passion for a 'real game, Turrican, to 
this day I still remember thinking 'what a massive game that was'.

 A 1st quarter life crisis (well, it wasn't a mid life crisis... I'm 
not THAT old yet) saw my Commodore traded in for a rucksack and a few 
other bits'n'pieces, sadly 'twas all for nowt and I now had no 
computer.... I WAS DEPRESSED!!, on the dole with no computer at all 
(whoa, get out those violins folks), at the time though Mandy and I 
had more important things on our minds...but I'll not go into that.

 After sorting ourselves out I managed to get my hands once more on 
another Speccy 128, this was also the first time I actually tried to 
get anywhere with ELITE (ye olde trading'cum'blow the sh*t out of ye 
nasty pirate type blokey's' space game), after a few months I finally 
saw the computer of my dreams....a 512k STFM, I was in awe of this 
mighty machine.....and I wanted it.
…
And what motivated you to get into that ol' grey wedge produced by the 
Tramiel corporation??

GFX, SOUND....EVERYTHING....read on...

 Stuart Farmer was the mush who initially owned the FM after shelling 
out 50 quid for it, sitting in the background with my (by comparison)
crappy little speccy I thought 'if I wait long enough he'll get bored 
playing on it and he'll sell/swap it', well, I was  halfway right, he 
did indeed get fed up of it...especially since he blew the PSU in it 
(and then he replaced the  fuse in the PSU with a 13AMP one...sad or 
what), the 13amp fuse also blew...taking half the tracking underneath 
the main PSU PCB, a real mess, still, I had seen the GFX and I didn't 
care, I swapped my working speccy 128k for the knackered ST, a small 
investment to ANALOGIC swapped the screwed up psu for a reconditioned 
one (well, actually they just repaired my knackered one but I wasn't 
complaining...'MY' ST now worked, that's all I wanted to know...).

 Next came the inevitable upgrades....erm, am I boring you, o.k., I'LL 
CONTINUE HAAAaaaa!!!

 The internal drive was single sided...and also knackered, an enormous 
amount fiddling with screwdrivers on the head alignment screws really 
got to me, not even 1 game loaded without adjusting those blummin 
heads, time for my second repair and upgrade, a new internal and 
external drive....the rest is now history...almost, my passion for the 
ST lives on to this day.

…Would you like to go into nauseatingly close detail about your 
hardware set up??

4160 STE (4Mb).
32Mb Seagate/80Mb Quantam hard drive's using ICD Link II.
Star LC-10 mono printer.
V.32bis 14,400 Voice/Fax/Modem.
Blitz turbo External disk drive.
Amstrad CTM 644 Colour Monitor.
ADSPEED STE 8/16Mhz accelerator card.(it's poorly at the moment but 
it's in the capable hands of ALIEN TECHNOLOGIES..a little plug there).
Mastersound 2 cart.
Ultimate Ripper cart.
Amstrad micro system (useful for thumping out those .MODs), 
Jag joypad.
and the usual mouse, joysticks etc.

Coming soon (when dosh allows):

ADSpeed 8/16Mhz accelerator (when it's repaired)
Larger Hard Drive (100Mb for œ39 from Gasteiner..another plug)
Modem usage tutorial.
Hand scanner.
...erm, anything else that comes along that's also a damned good 
bargain.

…What would your unlimited cash dream machine look like??

Ohh, something like N.A.S.A's Space Program setup (mind you I'd still 
not get rid of my current set-up), well, you DID say unlimited cash, 
right?.....

…What motivated you to become Dave Hollis, diskzine editor!!

UMMm!!, the demise of P.O.G. (The Panther Owners Group) was primarily 
responsible, I enjoyed writing in and sending tips to all those 
Frontier players...when POG closed its doors I had nothing to do and I 
didn't want to fall into the trap of playing games all day...that's 
a REAL couch spud trip...

…What was your original vision for the magazine??

Originally I wanted to fill the gap that POG had left and throw in a 
little platform for reader interaction to go with it thus, ST+ 
(incorporating P.O.G.) was born.

…And how do you think it has turned out thus far??

Well, aside from the lack of reader contributions pretty well, we've 
since dropped the POG connection due to lack of interest in that side 
of the mag though I still hold the rights to POG and have all the back 
issue's, certainly ST+ is getting about though it does get a little 
disheartening to know that there may be hundreds or thousands of folks 
reading my zine and yet hardly any of them are willing to put back a 
little effort by way of contributing, this, I believe is the primary 
reason for so many zines closing down, well, that and the lack of 
commitment and/or enthusiasm on the part of the Editors.

…What are your likely plans for the future of ST+?? Any juicy exclusive 
news??

Tony Greenwood is forever updating/upgrading the ST+ shell, at this 
time he's probably ready to send me a letter bomb though coz I keep 
sending him 'requests' for more improvements though our unspoken motto 
at ST+ is 'never stand still'.

Though GENERALLY alike not ONE ISSUE of our zine is ever completely 
the same, minor enhancements mean that there is always something new 
to discover with every issue, added samples, mouse control etc.

As for the future, who knows, I like to think that my words today will 
not fall on deaf ears and more people will realise the need for zines, 
too many people are using the 'net' and are ignoring the fact that not 
everyone has a modem or access to one, therefore, zines are going to 
play....actually they ALREADY play, a crucial role on the Atari scene.

Whatever happens we'll keep going for as long as people are 
interested.

…What do you think of the rest of the diskmag scene?? (Excessive Maggie 
related creepery permitted!)

In short....dire...NOT because of the quality but for the lack of 
interest from the public, I'll not become repetitive and repeat what I 
just said about reader contributions but I WILL draw attention to it.

It doesn't matter how great a zine is, even the likes of Kev Davies's 
ST Beermat relied on reader interaction/contributions. 

I still get a buzz from seeing my name on a scroller or in a zine and 
it's great to know I'll not die being a complete unknown... This 
opportunity awaits ANYONE who can be bothered to write in so why 
they're not doing so is beyond me.

Going back to the original question though, the overall standard is 
good, in some cases excellent (Maggie included - can I have that 
tenner now, Chris?...;-). Now that Atari is officially dead, more and 
more people are comming out of the closet and trying their hand at 
filling the gap, ST+, Kelstar, ST Highway to name just three. 

Now, I'm not gonna say ALL the new zines are brilliant publications, 
quite frankly a lot of 'em are not but then, not everyone's perfect, I 
would rather see a few crappy zines on the scene as well as the great 
one's than no publications at all, besides, everyone has their own 
tastes, what might seem lame to ME 'might' be someone else's idea of 
excellent reading material.
…
And could you tell us a little bit about the mysterious 'Panther 
Owners Group' that you were also involved in??

Well, once upon a long time ago a mush named Mike Gray decided that he 
liked Frontier (Elite 2) sooooo much that he would start up a user 
group, a quick reader advert to ST Format later and he was inundated 
with requests for his mag, P.O.G...one from myself included.

After a while I was granted the dubious title of Art Editor, pity that 
was all it was,  a title, nothing ever really came of it, I simply 
knocked up a few piccies and sent 'em to Mike, that's IT, nothing to 
write home about really.... Well, I was never that good with pixels 
anyway.

…What are your other interests on the ST, when time permits??

MODS, I can't write 'em but I DO  love 'em, at this time my trusty old 
copy of BACKTRACK (STE ONLY .acc MOD player) is blasting tunes in my 
lug'ole, maybe one day Protracker will become childs play to me... But 
not for a while yet..

As mentioned before I'm also not averse to a little artwork here and 
there, likewise programming, a little STOS utility named STOGAS is the 
fruits of my labour (with more than a little help from my ol' mate 
and resident ST+ STOS editor Bryn Jones).

I suppose I dabble at everything but my main task on the ST has to be 
word processing, I honestly think that I've typed up well over 50Mb of 
text since I first got my ST (and THAT'S a very conservative guess), 
I'm always typing, the length of this docs should give you an idea...

…What are your other interests, when the ST permits!!

My ST....well, it's ALL I do really, well, o.k. so maybe I do spend a 
little time with my other hobby, Star Trek.... My dining room is 
filled with Space ships from all the TREK series (TOS, TNG, DS9 and 
VOYAGER), I would estimate over œ300 quids worth of models in all, not 
to mention my Starfleet uniform and extras (tricorder, phaser etc).

I think, if it wasn't for WARP or NOVA (excellent Atari Trek/SCI-FI 
zines) ST+ might well have been a trekkie zine called Sci-Fi+...

…**Some views now**

Atari vs Amiga vs PC  

Oh dear, you've done it now...I could type for hours over this but 
I'll not, instead I'll lay it out like this, if you want to spend 
œ700+ on a Pentium, go ahead, there's no denying you'll get state of 
the art technology combined with fantastic gfx, SFX and speed... For 
about 6 months, by then you'll have to shell out another few hundred 
quid to upgrade memory, Hard drive space etc. just to retain 
compatibility with the latest releases.

Mike Gray learned this lesson, about a year ago he got his hands on 
about 1600 quid, he went straight out and brought a Pentium 75 and 
came back home with little or no change, now you can pick up the SAME 
system for about 799 quid..... Although quite usable and STILL 
technically superior to the humble ST, its out of date, nuff said 
really.

Amiga, well, I'm not gonna kid you about this, I've not spent any 
appreciable time on one of these so I couldn't tell you anything other 
than what I've heard and I'm not one to judge something on other 
people's opinion so I'm gonna pass, save to say that I've had a blast 
on an Amiga and was impressed with its sound and GFX.

ST, fu**in' brilliant matey, well, I would be a hypocrite to say 
otherwise huh?, o.k., so we don't have the super fast CPU, we're 
limited to 16 colours on screen without the use of specialised 
programs or graphics cards and the list of 'horrors' go ever onward 
BUT, then, we:

A: Are not forever being  pressured into upgrading JUST to retain 
   compatibility.
B: Are able to run MOST software on a standard 1Mb system.
C: Do not  have to copy from CD to Hard drive just to get games up and 
   running (well, not as a matter of course anyway).
D: Do  not have the  masses of  the hardware  industry dictating to us 
   what we should spend our money on next.
E: Do have a dedicated and enthusiastic userbase.
F: Do have great feeling of community.
G: Don't have to shell out a fortune for a basic setup.
H: Do have an excellent  MIDI machine that's just waiting to be 
   explored by still thousands of people (myself included)
I: Do have an operating  system that has led the way for ALL other 
   computers and become a standard interface.

...the list, as you know, is endless.

ST v PC 

It's a simple case of 'you get what you pay for' but with an ST what 
you pay for will last you as long as you want it to without you having 
to worry about upgrading unless YOU want to. In every respect the PC 
is far superior to the ST... Maybe with the exception of its midi 
capabilities but then you pay through the nose for it... Over and over 
again.

ST v Amiga

Well, pass, apart from the obvious 'how to you create an auto running 
game on an Amiga?' and 'Don't format your workbench disk mate!' type 
rantings there's not much more I can add, if the Amiga was such a dog 
why did it sell at least as well as the ST... (Some would say though, 
that madness on the part of its buyers might have had something to do 
with it).

…Who's your favourite Atari person or organisation and why??

Oh no way!!!, I honestly couldn't pick out one person, so many people 
have helped me out over the last year but if I really have to thank a 
few people it would have to be (not including family that is):

Tony Greenwood - for the ST+ shell, without him ST+ wouldn't have gone 
beyond issue 2 (IMHO).

The ST+ crew, the finest and most dedicated team of writers this side 
of the ST.

Mike Gray - without Mike I wouldn't have got involved in the scene at 
all..

Peter Augustin - Wotta mate this bloke is, patient, forgiving, 
generous.. etc.

...well, I have to add you, Chris, coz without your help ST+ would 
certainly not be the zine it is today...(erm, that WAS a compliment 
heh! heh!). Well, now you know who's responsible for me being around, 
you'll no doubt want to send 'em your 'thanks', their addresses can be 
found.....;-)

…Who's your *least* favourite person or organisation, Atari or non-
Atari??

Well, aside from a few 'grouchy ol' codgers' I've had no real bad 
experiences, this is why I love the Atari scene, it's just so damned 
friendly but....  if I could say a big 'screw you' to someone it would 
have to be to Microprose, they're more than happy to sell you a game 
so long as you don't expect any support, either technical or 
otherwise, if your game don't work.... Well, tough really. (ask 'em 
about ELITE or MIDWINTER II)... And then they whinge about piracy....

…Why do you think Atari blew it??

So many people have said their bit and although I don't believe I'm in 
a position to make any judgments I must conclude on a personal level  
that a lack of advertising was the primary reason for Atari's demise, 
I say this NOT because everyone else has but because it's true, the 
last time I saw an advert on the T.V. for Atari was the Discovery Pack 
advert, since then Atari kept to STF for their advertising and even 
THAT side of things went south, not a good strategy that.

Once upon a time Atari was the kings of the hardware industry, this 
no-one can argue but what's the point of developing all the hardware 
if only a handful of people know about it, the Jag is a major point, 
upon it's release it blew EVERYTHING out of the water but p*ss poor 
advertising meant that no-one got to hear about it, sure, us STF 
readers knew about it but what about joe public, did Atari really 
think that a few local radio adverts was gonna shift thousands of 
Jags...? Anyway, I listen to Northants 96, our local station and I 
NEVER heard even one advert, I suppose that all good things come to an 
end  and so it is that Atari have indeed come to the end however, 
they've left not only the scene but a powerful legacy, thousands of ST 
users are not simply gonna sell up and port over to the PC (if only 
because of monetary restraints) therefore, although it is a relatively 
small platform there are STILL enough of us to keep the scene going 
indefinitely, with the help of Mike Goodman and Joe Connor the Atari 
will live on if only because we refuse to simply give in to the big 
'fishes'.

Sencondly, let's be honest here, something said in Atari computing 
made me think, Atari chugged along happily for over 20 years... Surely 
that's long enough, if every company stayed around forever the world 
would get pretty stagnant, though a sad loss to us this can only be a 
good thing for the future of computing, the 'old' has gone, time to 
see in the new (though this don't mean I'm getting a pentium etc, not 
a chance...the STE's my pride and joy, I ain't going nowhere).
…
ST Format, and the new paper mag, Atari Computing

STF ran a very successful mag and although towards the end things got 
a little silly (4.50 for 60 odd pages) it was still an informative and 
interesting  read. I think a lot of readers abandoning one of the most
worthwhile mags on the scene (and I mean scene, NOT just the u.k.) was 
a BIG mistake and only now are they realising it, STF was competing 
with a big market and although it's bigger brothers like PC Format 
were still selling, recent figures  showed that Future Publishing 
could no longer justify producing STF, readership figures (believed to 
be reasonable) were in fact grossly overestimated, stocks of unsold 
STF's were returned to Future and thus, with the illusion ended, Future 
decided to pull the plug on its only Atari publication.

Now, however, there is Atari Computing with Joe Connor at the helm. I 
said that all the 'unfaithful' STF readers would regret leaving, well, 
I think that AC'S readership figures prove they did indeed regret 
their leaving for as far as I know at least one re-print run of issue 
one has already been undertaken by AC, on the first day of the ATARI 
SHOWS '96 AC had sold well over its expected amount of copies of issue 
1, in fact they had to restrain themselves from selling any more for 
fear of letting down the Sunday show prospective buyers.

I myself was impressed enough to subscribe to the first 3 issues and
for issue 1, well, it was great, the content was wide and varied and 
(as I've said in ST+) it's great that they've not forgotten the 'small 
folk' in that Maggie, WAG and the like all got a look in...in more 
way's than one.

…Do you think Esther Rantzen looks old and raddled on the telly or 
what??

HEY!!....That's my mum you're slaggin' off.... Heh! Heh!, I think that 
although a raggidy ol' girlie she still has a heart of gold...

…And is Cilla Black a screechingly mad scouse bag with a ginger wig??

HEY!!!.... That's my DAD you're talkin' about....heh! heh!, I really 
don't like her, not only because she's an ugly bi*ch but also because 
she turned me down when I asked her out...SH*T!!!!, my secrets out... 
…
The state of things in the world today??

Well, with ST+ around the worlds gettin' better:....

AMERICA: I for one would  be worried with a bloke called Bob 'DOLE' 
running for office ....?, still, Clinton's in and he's free to 'build 
his bridge'.

U.K.: Jobseekers allowance, more like pocket money... If you're good.

R.O.T.W.: Erm, pass, I'm an ignoramous, except that is for the media, 
why the hell do they 'use' the unfortunate countries to gain 
viewers/readers, one minute it's Bosnia, the next it's Ethiopia, then  
on to...... Well, you get the idea.

…How do you see your longer term future (computing related that is)

Are these questions deliberately laid out thus to confuse the hell out 
of me....?, if so your doin' a great job...anyway.

HOOOoo baby, that's a toughie, I suppose it's down to everyone else 
really, I'll still knock out ST+ even if I get 0 contributions coz I 
know that it'll still be read...somewhere, as long as folk are happy 
to read our wibblings I/we are happy to knock out a monthly zine..it 
would be nice to be told 'well done' once in a while though (present 
company excepted of course).

For the long term, well, I've no idea, maybe N.A.S.A. will ask me to 
knock up a regular zine about the space program, maybe I'll get paid a 
million quid a year to do it...then again I might wake up and eat my 
cornflakes....!!!...one things for sure, unless something DRASTIC 
happens I, and ST+ will be here for years to come (and those of you 
thinking 'I've heard THAT before' think of this), for the most part 
diskzines work on a non-profit making basis, we don't charge for 
ANYTHING, obviously we expect the usual Blank disk and S.S.A.E. but 
other than that we're free, and always will be, as for ST+ personally, 
well, even with the likes of Titan Designs and Goodmans int., Analogic 
Computers, Floppyshop etc. advertising with us not a bean will ever be 
made in profit, we're here to do a service to our readers, so long as 
there are readers around... We will be also.

…How could we make it generally better for everyone?

When you say 'it' I assume you mean life, well...

TOTAL WORLDWIDE NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT!!!, 

..no more wars, no more suffering, no more hunger......you get the 
idea. Peace and love dude, nope, I'm not a greenpeace member or a 
hippy type dude but you gotta agree with their philosophy, o.k, in 
reality you couldn't simply disarm the entire world...or could you, 
according to the DISCOVERY CHANNEL, total world expenditure on arms 
etc. adds up to around œ1,000,000 A SECOND!!!, sh*t man, and they moan 
about a lack or resources to feed the starving or space exploration, 
mabey I'm a dreamer...but I'm not the only one ;-)...ahem!.

…On a lighter note, which is your favourite Star Trek series and 
character from that series??

Well, for just plain simple drop dead looks, it would have to be Bev 
Crusher (T.N.G.), for being a real blokey type mush, it would have to 
be Sisko (DS9).

Erm, that's it really, I know that not everyone likes Trek so I'll not 
wibble on for fear of upsetting those who don't.

…-End- 

No it's not, it ain't the end until I say it's the end....

.....


......



..........


There, NOW it's the end....


Cheers - Dave.
