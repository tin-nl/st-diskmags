Of all the different stages and pages of Maggie, this is the one that 
gives me most anguish and difficulty.. 

The problem with trying to predict what will set the world on fire in 
three months time usually leads to a situation where you are caught out 
with soggy matches and a large can of non-inflammable substance.. 
Circumstances, fate, call it what you will, doesn't usually oblige, and 
is quite keen to come up with something totally different instead..

Still, we'll guess confidently at what you might see in a future issue 
of Maggie, even if it isn't in the very next issue.. Some or hopefully, 
all of these will be seen in 1997 no doubt..

Nemesis.. Ah yessss...

Nemesis just about made it into 1996, as the fitting service for people 
who didn't want to fit one themselves, came into operation.. For those 
of us who trusted Titan, but weren't keen to put their Falcon into the 
hands of Parcel Force, the wait was somewhat longer.. Titan are taking 
the whip to the oddjobs doing the printing of the installation manuals, 
and this should finally be with us.. (before Easter?)

I want to do a major piece on Nemesis, its fitting in, operation, and 
how it makes my Falcon a happier and better adjusted machine, not upset 
anymore by the sniggering taunts of the other computers in the nursery 
who make references to its '16 mhz-ness'.. This was going to be a fairly 
large chunk of text, and could not be done in a hurry, which is what 
would have happened if it had been rushed for issue 22..

Demos..

Expect to see something really special from Avena if the other members 
back up Tat, will the 'Motion demo finally show up as well.. And what of 
those many 'Scene News' reports of work in progress of groups from 
Sweden to Poland? We'll keep you posted.. (Keep an eye around Easter 
time!)

Games..

We should see several new releases, on my personal wish list, are 
'Running', 'Spy Hunter', 'Willy the Adventurer', and anything new from 
the makers of Neurobotix for the Falcon.. Any new games for the Jaguar, 
especially Battlesphere and Zero Five.. For the ST, anything new from 
Tony Greenwood, and Ed Clevelands Donkey Island game.. There will be 
other surprises, no doubt..

Travelling..

There will be more Atari shows in late April '97, and we'll be back!! 
There is also the distinct probability of an additional Scottish Atari 
Show.. Expect something from all of these, a possible realtime 'Maggie 
Team goes north of the border' type of production.. Foreign shows, Fried 
Bits, Symposium et al, seem to be due for replacement by something 
called the Siliconvention.. Are we going? Well we don't know yet, but 
I'm sure someone will come up with a report for the event, even if we 
don't make it..

Multimedia..

This always manages to look after itself.. Some words on the new Red 
Dwarf series, due for showing shortly, may well go in here..

Diskmags..

I've got a feeling that 1997 will be a relatively quiet year after the 
turmoils of 1996.. Famous diskmags can only die once, (and please don't 
go on about the 'Undead ST News') and we've sort of reached the limit as 
to the number of new diskmags the market can substain.. With due respect 
to the large number of newer and more locally focused diskmags about, I 
would really like to see a new scene orientated serious Maggie 
competitor this year if such a thing is forthcoming..

Other things..

More silver platters, more Falcon specific collections, and peculiar 
stuff reviewed..

New hardware other than Nemesis.. The Centek Falcon clone is due later 
in the year.. More as we get it!

Various other ST emulators on the PC considered, (Hint to Richard K. - 
How are you getting on with GEMulator? Might be a good subject for a 
first Maggie article..) Also a look at the STonX UNIX based ST emulator 
once the chappie I know finally gets a TOS ROM image organised..

New GEM based SID chip player that can run as a deskacc!

New and whizzy MPEG player from Sweden..

A huge piece/ultimate encyclopaedia on Falcon games..

And on the subject, a comprehensive Maggie A-Z reference guide, like the 
one that appeared in the final issue of ST News..

The long delayed revival of 'In the Trashcan'..

Almost certainly more Poetry Corner..

Whilst on the theme of 'sick and twisted', something about the 
forthcoming UK General election, due no later than May 1997!!

More of everything else..

Maggie compilation issue, (Twelve to Twenty..) This was going to be 
done, sort of now, but the proper Maggie 22 is still hanging around.. 
Say, February when I get a bit more time then..

Maybe another locally organised party.. Probably not a Maggie party on 
its own, but done as a joint venture, say with ST+ mag or something??? 
If this were to happen, probably around the summer months..

Now we're really stabbing in the dark here..

 CiH  3.1.97 - Still waiting to finish this..
