         The Illustrated Hickhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
                    By Kev 'Taffy' Davies.

„Yet another day, yet another new way to market that Douglas 
Adams' masterpiece. 

When you come across this book sitting on the shelf of your local 
book store, it doesn't just sit there quietly. It refuses to be  
intimidated by the surrounding Pratchett novels.It refuse to bow 
down to the "War and Peace" pocket edition sitting on the self 
below. No it shouts aloud "„Buy me you b******d!!".   

 So why does it shout aloud, well there are two things you 
instantly notice about this book. Firstly it is outsize (approx. 
50cm by 30cm) and secondly its  dust jacket is just one large 
hologramic starfied, with the title embossed upon it (incidently, 
if you remove the jacket it has the words "DON'T PANIC" in large 
friendly letters on the cover). Well you know now what it looks 
like from the outside, and why it just will not shut up. This 
book is really LOUD!

  The contents of the book is not quite what you would expect. Of 
course you've got the story of Arthur Dent („If you don't know who 
Ar„thur Dent is, where have you been these last 15 or so years?), 
but it is the illustrations that totally make your jaw drop, out 
of your skull, and spend a few months in Florida to recover.  

These are not just mere illustrations these are true colour 
computer generated mega-illustrations with costumed models 
playing the parts („Check out Tali as Trillian ;->). Here of 
course we have a slight problem, Zaphod Beeblebrox.  For those of 
you that don't know, Zaphod has two heads and three arms. Thus a 
little computer jiggery-pokery is required to really bring him to 
life. It is absolutely seamless. You really cannot see which head 
or arm were pasted on, really professional.  The backdrops are 
similarly done, and the same care and affection has been lavished 
upon them to make the join perfect.   On coming to the end of the 
book, imagine my surprise. I was drooling over the piccys(„as 
o„pposed to drooling over Tali), I came upon Douglas Adams in the 
role of a cop („Shooty, or Bang Bang? I am not quite sure). Nice 
little cameo for Dougy anyway.

 In conclusion there is not a lot I can really say, a perfect 
book converted into a different format, which fits the style of 
the literature perfectly. A little over priced at twenty five 
pounds sterling, but for fans like my self, a real joy.

  I could in fact continue to tell you how superbly, 
mindnumbingly, megaganticly (Megaganticly? Is that a word? It is 
now!) it really is. However "Friends" is on the TV in five 
minutes, so I am going to watch that for a bit.
