                          THE INSOMNIA DEMO
                            BY LUZAKS TEAM 
======================================================================
 
Before you reach for the quit button, this  is not a sample & PI1 demo 
featuring the popular English's beat combo "Faithless",  but  a  multi 
part STE demo which breaks some new ground on everyone's favourite 16-
bit box.

This demo arrived in the Maggie offices  in  a  strange format: MSA. Ah 
yes, the Magic Shadow Archiver, I remembered  scratching  my  head and 
wondering where on earth I had put this old packer.  For  those  of  
you too young to remember this piece of software, the MSA converts all 
the tracks on a disk into a single file, invaluable if you want to copy 
raw data disks such as demos. As all Falcon demos are file based and 
mainly have to run  from  the hard drive, the MSA has slipped out of 
use.

So it was with some nostalgia that I  created my data disk with MSA and 
inserted into the STE and turned. I shuddered  as I remember the 
horrendous complexity of writing interrupt driven loaders and  disk  
level  protection systems. Us Falcon owners have got it easy - a few 
calls to GEMDOS and bob's your uncle.

A pleasant dance style module wobbled  forth  from my monitors decrepit 
speakers as the demo began. Some introductory  logos appeared, the 
"Insomnia Demo" legend being inexplicably superimposed over a pair of 
female lips.

"Landscape" shouted a  nasty  font  on  the  next  screen  and  we  
were whisked Ordinance Survey style into the first effect. This is a 
voxel type dot landscape which scrolls about. You have seen the type 
before - the lower blue dots are the sea, and the higher green  dots  
are  the  hills.  This  landscape is quite well presented and moves 
about  in  a  reasonably  nippy  way. Cartography fans would approve.

The next presentation screen appears, this  one  with a blurred vectors 
image in the corner and some  text  informing  us  that  we  will  soon  
witness some "3D Rotate".

What appears next is a line vector  shape  merrily rotating. It spins 
and morphs into other shapes. As it is in green and slightly shaded 
around the edges, it is very reminiscent of a similar effect in  the 
"Warum" demo. The shading, I think, is just a bitplane effect  where  
some  graphics  are already overlayed onto the other bitplanes around 
the edges of the screen causing the change in colour when the one plane 
line vector passes over them.

Overall this is another  competent  effect  which  admirably  keeps  up 
with its Falcon cousins.

A nicer font now informs of the  impending "2D Function patterns". 
These work in a similar way as fractals  -  a  mathematical  formula  
that produces a pleasing graphical effect. They are calculated in real 
time on the screen "while-u-wait". This is a bit disconcerting as just  
as  one  image is finished and you are just starting to appreciate it 
another one is drawn  over the top. It would have been better if the 
screens were  calculated  in  the  background  and swapped to when 
finished. The screens are all rendered  in  tasteful  grey.  It would 
be nice if they were a bit more active - a simple colour cycle would 
have added to things.

"INTEL OUTSIDE" proudly proclaims a  superbly  rendered  logo which now 
appears. This is infinitely better than many  of  its  counterparts 
that have appeared on the Falcon.

We now have another old  favourite,  the  spinning  dot  objects. Four 
3D things bounce and rotate about the screen. The dots are shaded as 
they move to the back of the object giving a sense of  depth.  The  
rotation is only done around the Y axis to keep things simple. This 
effect  has  appeared  on a number of ST demos, most memorably by Dune 
(on Faith I think). Some like it dot....

This leads on to a  rather  rudimentary  form  of  "texture mapping". A 
rotating square bar appears in the middle of  the  screen spanning its 
whole width. Those of you have seen Aura's "Hi-Fidelity Dreams"  will 
be familiar with this object, but this has the added twist of  having  
some  cloud graphics mapped on to it. A relatively simple effect  (the  
mapping  is  just  horizontal  lines) and rather spoiled by the fact 
that the graphics seem to be slightly corrupted. Bar-humbug.

This is a CAD! Yes, next up  are  some  objects  created in dodgy old 
ST package "CAD-3D". They are all 2  colour  and  move  very  slowly 
over a grey background which has some embossed text in it. A sign  of  
the times is when we get to meet our old friend the torus again. He is  
becoming  a  bit of a star. The goblet is more refreshing (although 
sadly empty of  alcoholic beverage), but the choice of colours on the 
objects is awful. Thank god  they only had two to choose, if they were 
running in true  colour  mode  it  would  have  led  to many colour 
induced suicides.  I seem to remember someone  complaining  that CAD-3D 
stores all faces twice, perhaps this is why the objects  move in such a 
geriatric fashion. Senior CADs!

Three words appear that will strike fear into even the most casual demo 
watcher: "Fast Fractal Generator". The return of  fractals into demo 
fashion is something to be welcomed with the same enthusiasm  as  the 
rejuvenation of flares or Kevin Keegan perms.

A mandlebrot appears on the  screen.  Some  13 seconds later, another 
mandlebrot appears. What happened to the "fast" bit?  Just  as  we are 
about to call in the demo police, things speed up a bit (well  to  
around 7 seconds). To be honest if you are going to do a "Fast  Fractal  
Generator",  please make it FAST! We don't care if you cheat! We don't  
care  if  you  store  all  the fractals as PI1s and screen swap between 
them - at least it  is over faster. After 14 screens full of assorted 
blue mandlebrots and julias we  are  fortunately  onto the next part of 
the demo. It seems like years have  passed,  but  in  reality it has 
only been a couple of minutes.

More 3D vicar? The polygons  are  back!  And  this  time  they are 
flatshaded 3D objects, which are also lightsourced. These are a lot 
faster than the previously featured 3D stuff, although the shapes  are  
a  lot more crude. The main problem with this screen is that there  is  
a  bug  in  the delta-clearer so bits of the polygon are left smeared 
across the screen.

If amongst this oasis of 3D, you are feeling in a Liam Gallagher mood 
and "fancy a line", then the next effect is for  you.  Vector line 3D, 
not seen since 1832. Well this is not strictly true as most of the 
Falcon demos of 1996 featured line vectors! This screen has a neat 
effect where one shape explodes into millions of pixels that then form 
the next shape. There is a slightly unfortunate pause just before one 
shape explodes ("please  wait  -  precalculating!")  but perhaps I am 
just being pedantic. This screen  also  has  a  nice non-black 
background, which makes it look better somehow. Something to do with 
colour psychology probably.

"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you have all been waiting 
for, a fast texture mapped cube on the ST!". Really? Well not quite, 
but and attempt is made in a roundabout way. This isn't a  traditional  
polygon cube, but a cube made up of dots, and these being different 
colours form small images on each face of the cube - hence texture 
mapping. If  they  could  have  managed to rotate more dots then the 
effect  would  be  more  convincing,  as  it  is  the  graphics are bit 
indistinct. I can just  about  make  out  something  that  may  or  may 
not be a bumblebee standing upright and waving at the camera.

Another audacious attempt  at  converting  falcon  effects  to  the  
ST. Gouraud shading! With proper 3D polygons!  This  screen  starts  
off in a very promising manner with a nice looking gouraud shaded shape 
appearing in the distance. As it gets closer, the problems of 
attempting gouraud  with a 16 colour palette become evident. It looks 
horrible with chunky jagged  lines of colour across the faces. If only 
they had used some sort  of  dither routine, it might have been 
alright. It's a case of technical merit succeeding over aesthetic 
appeal.

The demo ends with a nice logo. The  music continues playing, as it has 
done all through the demo even when new sections  were loaded in. This 
demo has obviously been influenced by the falcon demos. No main menu or 
selector, and thankfully no scrollers, just one effect following  
another.  The effects themselves have been taken a leaf out of  the  
030's  book  -  those  Warum  lines, lots of 3D stuff, gouraud shading. 
Sometimes the  demo  is  a  bit  ponderous,  but we have become 
accustomed to demos taken 5 or 6  megs  of  hard drive space and simply 
flashing through effects, this is just on a  single  disk.  It  would 
be nice if they had made some attempt to sync the effects to  the 
music, but again this is easier to do on the falcon than on a raw data 
disk.

So overall we have an ambitious multipart STE demo with good music and 
some cool effects. Insomnia? This demo is a real dream.
