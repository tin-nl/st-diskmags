A small selection of material from this recent event of which we know 
not a lot about, apart from the fact that Inter of 'Obnoxious' demo 
fame did the organising..

First off, the 4Ktro's..

Å'Lost'..

No File id, no doc file to indicate who did this, not even anything in 
the main program itself.. For your 3970 bytes, you get a twirling 3-D 
textured maze effect leaning towards the left hand part of the screen.. 
The nearest comparison you can make is that this looks like a promising 
concept demo for a '3-D Ant Attack' for the 1990's.. No quit option 
except for the very final one of 'reset'..

Å'Escape Plasmafire 4ktro'..

We are informed who did this one, with a partial input by Therapy, and 
a previously unkown or new group called Escape... This is based on the 
old standbys of plasma and flame effects.. Starts with a rippling logo 
which looks like it is going to burst into flame but does not.. The 
main part of this intro are screens of slightly chunky fire, which are 
then also rippled in a plasma-like fashion.. Not up to the Spirits 
effort, but then it moves onto some different non-flame patterns that 
suggest water, but don't quite get there.. More notable for the plasma 
rather than the fire.. It does give us the bonus of a clean well 
handled exit back to the desktop..

Another intro to conclude, we give you..

Å'Drooling' (34ktro!)

This one was by someone who became very well known by accident.. The 
main coder was an individual called Defjam, otherwise known as the 
'Symposium Sleeper'.. Before his crashing out session on his Mega ST 
keyboard, we also got to talk to him about his ST demo routines and we 
were duly impressed when he showed us some.. This one is a short intro 
and either utter pants, or very impressive depending on what the 
intended target computer was..

We start up the demo, and are rudely reminded that it needs an ST 
compatible screen mode to run.. Find one and then start again.. Some 
soundchip music with buzztone and digidrum waffles from the speakers 
and the main effect appears.. A slightly sluggish 3-D flaming vector 
cube rolls down the screen forever.. Behind it, a burning 'Checkpoint' 
Logo appears and dissolves into flame, then reappears, again forever 
unless you tell it to stop.. 

This single effect demo can be looked at in two possible ways.. For a 
Falcon, there is nothing too stunning, but I get the impression that 
this was coded on an ST and intended mainly for ST's, although I tried 
it on my old 'FM and only got the soundchip music.. Probably one for 
STe's then, in which case, this would be more impressive than first 
appearances would suggest..
