                               Captain Mari


        "Captain, we're being scanned."
        Damn, thought Mari.  They'd cut off the distress call from the 
survey party, but evidently not soon enough.  

        "Prepare to leave orbit.  Can you identify them?"

        "Hard to be sure at this range, but they're coming closer fast.
Warp 8.Bearing 160 mark 10.Looks like a Federation starship all right."

 "Lay in a course for the asteroid belt in the Ulana system.  Maximum
warp."  They'd be lucky to get 5.5. Mari had a good chief engineer but
an old ship.  Still, they could ill afford to lose the _Guardian_--she
was one of only three ships in the Bajoran resistance with warp
capability.  

        Mari saw the tension in Ulya's shoulders and forced herself to 
ignore it, as well as the tension in her own.  On the screen, the 
planet fell away beneath them.  The stars streaked as the ship went 
into warp.

Would the Federation ship pursue them or go into orbit and send 
assistance to the station on the planet?  If only the base hadn't 
offered resistance, or the survey party had not returned at the wrong 
moment. They could have been long gone before Federation reinforcements
arrived.  Fortune of war, she told herself. She thought of the long 
string of "if only"s separating her from her Starfleet career, from her
family, from her world.

        Tayron's voice interrupted her train of thought.

        "It's definitely a Federation ship, Galaxy class.  And it's 
after us. It's gone to Warp 9."
        
That was not good.  Mari touched a button on the arm of her chair.

        "Engineering, see if you can give us a little more speed."  
She called up an image of the ships' positions on the console at her 
right.  The asteroid belt was getting closer, but the distance between
the _Guardian_ and the Federation vessel was decreasing steadily and 
rapidly.   She turned her head toward Tayron.

        "Battle stations."

        Tayron nodded and reached for a control.  Red lights began to 
flash and she heard Tayron's voice making the announcement to all of 
the _Guardian_'s three decks. One of her first acts as captain had been
to get rid of the klaxons; she'd always found them distracting.

        "We're being hailed."

        Mari saw no particular point in talking to Starfleet. She knew
perfectly well what they were going to say. 

        "Ignore it."

        Tayron nodded.  "They're in weapons range.  They have a sensor 
lock on us."
        
"Evasive maneuvers."  Ulya's fingers flitted over the console.  If they
were lucky, they'd make the asteroid belt before they were hit.  They'd
have to stay at warp until the last possible moment.

        Despite the inertial dampers, Mari felt the ship shift beneath 
her.  On the monitor, the red triangle which was the starship described
a long arc as it turned to follow.   The _Guardian_ dove, and again she
felt the motion.  Again, the starship changed course to follow.  For a
big ship, it was surprisingly maneuverable.  

       "They're firing a photon torpedo."  The words were hardly out of
Tayron's mouth when the ship shuddered.  "Shields at 70 percent."  Mari
changed the readout on her monitor. She saw a tiny red flash.  The ship
shuddered again.

      "Damage to the aft shield grid and the starboard nacelle. 
Shields at 30 percent."  Mari leaned forward, tense, as though she 
could somehow, with her body, add to the ship's speed.  Perhaps the 
_Guardian_ shouldn't have been risked on this raid, but a war could not
be fought without weapons and the mining equipment on this station had 
been the least-protected source in the vicinity.  Or would have been, 
if there hadn't happened to be a starship nearby.  There were more red
flashes on the monitor and she felt the ship lurch violently.  On the 
monitor the blue triangle came to a sudden halt.

        "Automatic warp drive shutdown has been triggered--two of the 
starboard field coils are damaged."  Tayron spoke breathlessly, but 
still with control.  

        "Maximum impulse.  All available power to the shields."  
The lights dimmed.    

        "Damage reports."

        "Hull breach on Deck 2, Sector C.  Force field holding.  
Reports of injuries..."  Tayron broke off.  "The Federation ship has 
dropped out of warp.  Their phasers are locked onto us."

     Mari looked at the monitor.  They weren't going to make it to the
asteroid belt.

  "All stop.  Cut power to weapons systems.  Open a hailing frequency." 
Ulya and Tayron moved to obey her orders as automatically as if they 
had practiced this operation.  

        "Hailing frequency open, Captain."

        "Federation vessel, this is Captain Mari Jarama of the 
_Guardian_, " she addressed the blank screen, which resolved itself 
into an image of the enemy ship's bridge.  It was a handsome, if bald,
human male who was the recipient of her brief message: "We surrender."

        The other ship's captain moved closer to the camera.  "This 
is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation starship _Enterprise_," 
he said in a low, powerful voice.  "Drop your shields and prepare to 
be boarded."

        She acknowledged and ended the transmission.  

     "Computer, initiate protocol 7, authorization Mari-2-1-5-9-blue."
She hoped that she'd designed the program well enough that Starfleet
Intelligence wouldn't be able to reconstruct the logs.  She turned to
Tayron.

        "Put me through to all decks."

     "Channel open," responded Tayron.  There was so much to say, and
no time to say it.

        "Attention, all personnel, this is Mari," she said, keeping 
her voice as steady as she could.  "The battle is over.  Boarding 
parties will be beaming over from the _Enterprise_ shortly.  I don't 
want any trouble." She paused.  "You've been a fine crew."  It sounded
so trivial as an acknowledgment of all they'd been through together, of
the battles won and avoided, the dangers and hardships faced, the 
precious moments of celebration.  But she didn't know what else to say 
but "Mari out."  Then she sat and waited.  The bridge was silent.  The
red lights were still flashing.

   There was a blue sparkling at the front of the bridge and four male
figures materialized:  a bearded human, a tall Klingon, a thin,
red-haired human, and a pale-skinned man whose race she did not
recognize.  They all wore serious expressions and phasers.  Mari's
attention was drawn to the bearded man,not just because a quick survey
of their collars revealed him to be the ranking officer, nor just 
because he was very attractive, though she duly noted that.  There was
something familiar about him.  She stood, keeping her eyes on his face.
The Klingon watched alertly, his hand on his weapon.  The bearded man
slapped his comm badge.

  "Riker to La Forge."  Riker.  The name was familiar.  Mari tried to
  place it.
 
       "La Forge here."

        "How does it look?"

 "The damage is pretty bad.  I don't think the hull will stand up to a
  tractor beam without some repairs."

        "How long will you need?"

 "With a repair crew and some supplies from the _Enterprise_, I think I
  can have her ready to tow in an hour or so."

   "Proceed.  Riker out."  He touched the comm badge again.  "Riker to
   _Enterprise_."

   "Picard here.  Report."

   "Everything's under control.  Geordi doesn't think we can risk a 
tractor beam until some hull repairs are made.  He estimates one hour."

        "Understood.  Contact Cargo Bay 3 when you're ready to have the
_Guardian_'s crew beamed over.  Have any wounded beamed directly to
Sickbay. Once the crew is evacuated and the ship is secured, I want you
to leave Mr. Data in command and beam back over with the captain. 
_Enterprise_ out."

        Yes, it was Will Riker.  She hadn't recognized him with the 
beard.  It suited him, though.  They'd been shipmates briefly, on the
_Potemkin_. She hadn't known him well.  He'd been somewhat distant, 
focused on his work.  He'd been very ambitious in those days--Mari was
a little surprised to see that he hadn't made captain yet. In addition,
the scuttlebutt had been that he was trying to forget some woman. She'd
been strictly business herself, too, in those days, always trying to 
prove herself, to prove that a Bajoran could belong in Starfleet.  In 
the end, she had failed.

      Riker was looking at her.  She was acutely conscious of his gaze, 
of his proximity.

    "Do you have wounded?" he asked, his voice a touch softer.  She 
realized she had not received a casualty report.  Everything had 
happened too fast.  She turned to Tayron and requested one.   There 
were four seriously wounded and seven dead or missing.  That meant 
Starfleet had acquired sixteen prisoners. Riker ordered the red-haired
man, whose name was O'Connell, to arrange the beamout of the wounded.  

        "Order your crew to assemble in the cargo bay."

   She hesitated just for a moment.  He must have sensed her reflexive
mistrust.  His eyes flashed with anger.

 "We don't operate like that," he said tersely, with a slight emphasis
on the "we." Once she had been part of that "we." She felt the distance
between them in the coldness of his blue eyes.  She gave the order.  

  "Mr. Worf," he said to the Klingon, who gave a slight nod and glanced
around at the members of her bridge crew.  Ulya and Tayron met her eyes
as they proceeded to the door.  The navigator gave her a wry smile.

      Then she was alone on the bridge with Riker and Data.  For a few
moments, there was silence. Mari felt Riker's eyes on her.  She turned
her head and met his gaze, but she could not read his expression.  The
turbolift doors opened and O'Connell came onto the bridge.

 "The wounded have been transferred to the _Enterprise_ sickbay, sir," 
he reported. Moments later, Worf reported the transport of the rest of
the crew.  

  "Well, then," said Riker, turning to her.  He stood.  "Mr. Data, you
have the bridge."  He tapped his communicator.  

      "Riker to _Enterprise_.  Two to beam over."  The bridge of the
_Guardian_ disappeared.

 They stood in a transporter room, a puffy-faced human at the controls. 
Beside him stood a dark-eyed female. She wore a blue garment which was
unlike any Starfleet uniform Mari had ever seen, but she was wearing a
comm badge. Two young ensigns in yellow-and-black uniforms stood to her
left, the security detail.  

     "Welcome to the _Enterprise_," the dark-eyed woman said, somewhat
incongruously.  "I am Deanna Troi, ship's counselor."  She turned to
Riker.  "The captain's instructions are to begin immediately with the
interrogation, in the observation lounge."  He nodded.

No one spoke during the brief walk down the corridor or during the ride
in the turbolift, beyond Riker's brief command to the lift.  Mari tried
to use the interval of silence to collect herself, but it was hard to 
put the pain out of her mind, pain from the failure of her mission, 
the loss of her ship, pain, too, at being back aboard a Starfleet 
vessel as a prisoner.  She'd never been on a Galaxy class ship before,
but much of the interior design was familiar, the sounds, the smells.
The smell of the ship's air, in particular, brought back memories, the
same mix of Earth scents used on the _Potemkin_, which also had a 
mostly human crew, scents too faint for humans to notice but clear to 
her.  She knew some of them from her time on Earth: freshly cut grass,
seaweed, the pungent, resinous scent of rosemary.  The ship's corridors
were wide, their gentle curve testifying to the vast size of the 
vessel.  To the resistance, the _Guardian_ had been a big ship.  
Compared to the _Enterprise_, she was hardly more than a shuttle.  

The Starfleet officers, as usual, had spotless uniforms and not a hair
out of place.  Among them, Mari was conscious of her own  rather
disheveled appearance. Her tunic and trousers hadn't even originated on
the same planet, and they were worn and stained.  She'd sweated a good
deal since she'd last washed.A quick glance at her reflection in a dark
panel confirmed that several strands of her long, dark hair had escaped
from the twist she'd rather hastily pinned up this morning.  It seemed
such a long time ago now.

  They entered a long room with windows looking out on the stars, which
were stationary. Mari could not see the _Guardian_.  Riker motioned for
her to sit at one side of the long curved table which constituted the
room's principal furniture.  He and Troi sat down across from her.  The
security guards remained standing behind her.  She felt their eyes on
her, and Riker's blue eyes and Troi's brown ones across the table, and
behind them the stars.

"Computer, begin interrogation log, stardate 46102.8," Riker said, then
to Mari, "Please place your hand on the panel and state your name." 

She did as instructed, a little surprised at the calmness of her voice.

"Verified," came the mechanical voice of the computer.  "Mari Jarama,
formerly Lieutenant Commander, Starfleet, resigned stardate 44342.8." 

"Computer, append Captain Mari's Starfleet record to this file," Riker
said into space. She was a little surprised that he got the name right. 

On the _Potemkin_, she'd always been Lieutenant Jarama.  He looked at
her. "I remember you from the _Potemkin_. You were a good officer. And
now you've become a bandit."His voice was cold but not without passion.

 "You gave the order to fire on the base.  Twenty-seven innocent people
were killed."

"I am sorry, but we are at war.  How many of my people die every day in
the camps?" Actually, she was relieved. She had expected the casualties
would have been higher.  She didn't like to kill people, especially
people who weren't Cardassians.

"Did you prevent one death by attacking the base?  Your forces are far
too weak to make an impression on the Cardassians.  In the end, your
people's freedom can only be achieved by diplomatic means.  Raids like
this are counterproductive."

    "Diplomatic means have accomplished very little over the past forty
years," she said, as coldly as possible.  She did not like being on the
defensive.  That was the main reason she'd joined the resistance in the
first place.  And what had it brought her?  But she must fight such
thoughts.  Not only would they weaken her, but she suspected Troi was a
telepath.  She certainly looked like a Betazoid, and she was taking no
apparent role in the proceedings.   

Mari looked out at the stars, trying to draw strength, as she had 
always done, from the vast, cold, empty freedom of space. When she was
a girl, she and her mother would sit outside and look up at the heavens
for hours sometimes. For her mother, the stars were a constant reminder
of exile. She would tell Jarama about the moons of Bajor and point out 
the direction in which her homeworld lay, its sun just one more tiny 
white dot among many in the dark night sky.  For Jarama, the openness 
of the sky promised escape from the tedium of the camp.  She'd escaped
to Starfleet, then found she needed to escape from Starfleet. Now there
was no escape.  

        "Why did you attack the base on Serit Beta II?"

"We needed supplies.  If they had not resisted, no one would have been
hurt."  If that young red-haired commander hadn't been such a hothead. 
What was someone like that doing in command of a mining station anyway?

    "Where did you get the ship?"  He was switching to another line of
questioning. She could try to guess the questions in advance.  It might
be an interesting game.If only she could avoid thinking of the answers.

     "We bought it.  But I hardly think you're in the market for one."

     "Who did you buy it from?"

     "A Ferengi junk dealer." 

"It's junk now, but it wasn't junk when you bought it."  Both 
statements were true, of course.  It was a damned shame about the ship.
Not much of a ship by Starfleet standards, but the finest she'd ever 
commanded. Or ever would, presumably, since her career appeared to be 
over for good now.  She hadn't thought it would end like this.  

        "Who sold you the ship?"

"You're not going to get a refund on it.  It's no longer under warranty,
and photon torpedo damage isn't covered anyway."If they were asking, it
probably meant they didn't know.  Perhaps the reports of Federation
infiltration in the resistance were exaggerated.

"All right, we'll come back to that later.  Were you involved in the
raid on the Onadaga system?"

"What raid?"  There was no way the telepath wouldn't get the answer.

"You must have a hiding place between there and here.  Where is it?"

"I have no idea what you're talking about."  That had to be one of the
most frequently told lies in the galaxy.

"I have a feeling you'd tell the Cardassians.  Sooner or later."

That was clearly meant as a threat, but it wasn't a very credible one. 
If she'd really thought Starfleet would hand her over to the Cardies, 
she wouldn't be here.  The _Guardian_ might not be equipped with all 
the latest gadgets, but she did have the essentials, and for a ship 
with her mission that definitely included an auto-destruct system.

    "Why should you care about the Onadaga system?  That's none of the
Federation's business." Riker was bringing up that raid to put pressure
on her, but the Federation would be primarily interested in the raid on
the  mining station, which had been operated by humans from a colony in
a nearby system.  Unless Ulya was right about the secret negotiations
between the Federation and the Cardassians, but she was still pretty
confident that she had a better understanding of the Federation than 
her navigator did.  

     Riker and Troi exchanged glances.  Of course, she could tell him
telepathically what she sensed.  Damned inconvenient that the
_Enterprise_ had a telepath aboard.  

        "How many ships were involved in that raid?"   

"Four hundred and fifty-six," she said, trying to keep the real number
out of her mind. She could tell Riker was getting irritated.  She must
try to be patient.  

        "Was the raid on the Onadaga system staged from Korf II?"

      No, but it was a good guess.  Yes, she tried to think, trying to
visualize the planet. She looked past Riker, out at the stars. All that
space out there, and here she was, trapped.  She felt tired. She hadn't
slept well the last few nights, and then there had been the excitement
of the raid and its aftermath.  But she also felt nervous, irritable.
Her body needed to move.  To go through a battle sitting still in a 
captain's chair, naturally the Bajoran body was not designed for that.
She would have liked to stand up and pace the room,but she didn't dare.
She was pretty sure from Troi's expression that she was reading the 
impatience.

"What are the terms of the alliance between the resistance and the
Sarani?"

"There is no such alliance."  Not an alliance exactly.  She was tired.

"Did the Sarani give you the _Guardian_?  Or provide you with the funds
to buy her?"  This was dangerous territory. She tried to concentrate on
the table.  But perhaps that was too obvious. She was afraid to look at
Riker or, especially, Troi.  She forced herself to do it.

"I told you, we bought her from a Ferengi junk dealer."  The statement
was partially true; some of the components used in the rather extensive
modifications which had been necessary had been purchased from a 
Ferengi junk dealer.  

"Look.  We are not your enemies.  The Federation is the Bajorans' only
real hope. I promise you, we will not share any information you give us
with the Cardassians. But we need to know what's going on.  Even if you
had twenty ships like the _Guardian_, even if you had a hundred, you
would be no match for the Cardassians.  You can't hope for a military
solution."

"We don't need to defeat Cardassia. We only need to make the occupation
of Bajor sufficiently costly that they will not think it worth the 
price."

"And what is the price going to be for you?  The Bajorans are known for
their culture and science.  If they become a race of bandits and
terrorists, is that not too great a price to pay for freedom?  For an
uncertain hope of freedom?"

"From what I know of Earth history, I doubt humans would behave
differently.  You value freedom, too, very highly."  Humans had a very
high opinion of themselves and were easily flattered.

        "We value freedom, and we value honor.  Unprovoked attacks upon
civilians are not honorable.  There were thousands of casualties in the
Onadaga system."

"Cardassians.  I do not think Cardassians feel remorse when they kill
Bajorans."

   He stood and walked around the end of the table and spun her chair
around so that she faced him.His hands gripped her shoulders.  Her eyes
widened in surprise.  His eyes were very close to her, their gaze even
colder than before.  Why should he react so intensely?

"And if you can kill them without remorse, what does that make you?"

  Well, she couldn't, and that made her weak.  This was not an era in
which compassion for one's enemies was appropriate.  She needed to be
cold as a rogue comet in interstellar space.  Especially now. She felt
the warmth of his hands beginning to seep through her tunic. How long
had it been since someone had touched her?

Riker released her and straightened his back, a preoccupied expression
on his face. He looked over her shoulder at Troi.  His expression had
softened; indeed, a mysterious smile played on his lips.Mari turned her
chair back toward the table and looked over at Troi, whose large, dark
eyes were still fixed on Riker.Troi looked half irritated, half amused.

"Computer, suspend log." Riker turned to the security officers, handing
his phaser to the nearer one.  "Please wait outside."  

"Aye, sir," replied the ensign, with a puzzled look.  Troi stood up and
walked to the door at the far end of the room, turning to give Riker a
knowing smile.  Then Mari and Riker were alone, except for some sort of
plant in the corner.He gripped her shoulders again, pulling her towards
him.  She got to her feet.  He turned her so that her back was to the
table. She had no idea what would happen now. She wondered whether Troi
could still read her mind from outside the door.  Probably.  His hands
slid from her shoulders to her arms.  She jumped a little as his thumbs
brushed her breasts. She had felt trapped before, under the incorporeal
restraints imposed by eyes and phasers, but now she was physically
confined,the smooth curve of the tables edge hard against her buttocks,
Riker's body in front of her--she was a tall woman, but he was at least
fifteen centimeters taller--his strong hands on her arms.She tossed her
head, partly because a strand of hair in her face was annoying her,
partly because it was almost the only part of her body she could move
freely. He stood very close to her, close as a lover.  She was aware of
his many scents:  the warm smell of his body, a cologne with hints of
leather and wood (almost certainly Terran),the familiar slightly floral,
slightly chemical odor of Starfleet styling gel, and the very faint but
equally familiar smell of the fabric of his uniform, a smell detectable
only at very close range, like when she'd worn it herself.

She wondered what Riker's plans were. She suddenly missed the security
of Starfleet procedure.  She hadn't been happy before, sitting at the
table across from Riker and Troi, aware of the security guards in that
uneasy way one is aware of armed people behind one's back,but at least
she'd known what was going on, what the rules were, what part she was
expected to play.  Now she could only wait and see.

"You were a Starfleet officer. Why did you give that up?  What have you
gained by it?  What have you really done for Bajor by joining the
resistance?  And what have you done to yourself?"  His voice was softer
now, though the anger was still there.  

    "Why should you care?  I stand by my decision.  It's easy for you. 
Starfleet Headquarters is on Earth.  Starfleet is dominated by humans. 
Starfleet will always protect Earth's interests.  For you, there's no
conflict.  For me, there was. You don't know what it's like to be off
running around on one mission or another halfway across the quadrant 
when your people are living without freedom,when your people need you."

"Need you for what?  To kill random Cardassians who just happened to be
in the wrong place at the wrong time?  To raid mining stations and kill
innocent people?  What have you done for Bajor?"

That was a dangerous question.  She must fight the impulse to answer it,
to justify herself to him.  She must not even think about her missions. 
It was a risky tactic, she knew, but the best way she could think of to
drive such thoughts out of her mind was to focus on her attraction to
him. She studied his face carefully, concentrating on it.  His hair was
thick and dark,like many Bajorans' including her own. She imagined what
it would feel like between her fingers.  His eyes were blue like the
skies and oceans of his planet.  They looked at her as intently as her
own dark eyes looked at him. His nose had that disconcerting smoothness
of a human nose--it made him look young and unfinished.His beard helped
to counteract that effect.She had once dated a human with a beard.  She
remembered the feel of the stiff hair against her skin.She was becoming
intensely aware of her own body, of the warmth of his hands on her arms,
of the hardness of her nipples against the rough fabric of her tunic,of
the hard edge of the table against her buttocks, of the increased blood
supply to that area between her legs which had been off limits to
everyone except herself since Naran was killed last year.

His left hand moved to her face.  She started, half-expecting a blow,
but his fingers touched her cheek lightly and slid into her hair.  She
felt as though her skin had suddenly grown thinner, more sensitive.His
fingers were smooth and warm, cupping the back of her head.  One of her
hairpins fell onto the table, a small sound in the silent room.He moved
forward, pressing against her body.  She could feel the bulge of his
erection.  His right hand moved from her arm to the center of her back.  
 
"I want to know where those bases are," he said, but she could not have
answered even if she had wanted to because his lips covered hers, his
beard rough against her face, his tongue wet against her lips, seeking
entry.  The pressure of his chest against her hard nipples was almost
painful. He kissed her cheek and slowly moved down the left side of her
neck, nibbling and licking, the feel of his beard against her neck
driving her half crazy. Then he slowly moved back up again, running the
tip of his tongue along the ridges at the top of her nose,each in turn,
from the bottom to the top.  He kissed her forehead and returned to her
mouth, using his hand at the back of her head to turn her face up 
towards his.  This time, she did not keep her lips closed. Her hands, 
now gripping the edge of the table, were growing sweaty.She wanted him. 
Slowly she moved her hands to his back, feeling him start at her touch,
feeling the smooth fabric of his uniform,so different from Narans rough
tunic, a sensation out of her past. His right hand moved down the curve
of her back, holding her firmly against him.  Then he backed off a
little, dropping his left hand to her shoulder.
 
"I want to know where those bases are," he said again, in a low voice. 
"I can offer you...something in return."  
 
"Something you want as much as I do," she said.  He grinned, his teeth
flashing white in his dark beard, his eyes sparkling.

"You know I need to get some results, to justify these...unconventional
methods.Would you prefer to just sit there and stare at each other over
the table for hours on end?  And when I go off duty, there'd be someone
else to replace me, and someone else after that--it could be rather a
bore for you, but in the end we'd get what we want.  It would be much
more fun if you'd just tell me now."  He brushed the left side of her
neck lightly with his lips and beard.

"I'm not asking you to do anything which will harm Bajor's interests. 
We're not planning an attack on the resistance.We just want to be able
to monitor their activities in order to protect our people.  I need to
know where the bases are."

    She was struggling with herself.  She would have looked out at the
stars, but her back was to the windows. In front of her, there was only
Riker, his eyes gentle now.  As far as she could remember, they'd left
out this situation in her Starfleet training.  Riker stroked her right
breast. Perhaps her best bet was to play on his desires as he played on
hers. She reached up with her right hand and gently stroked the edge of
his ear.  She kissed him, pressing herself against him.  He responded
eagerly, slipping his tongue into her mouth.She twisted her hips gently
so that her hipbone slid across the ridge in his uniform.  She ran her
right hand down his spine, slowly, to the bottom of his shirt, then
slipped it up under the waistband, feeling his warm, bare skin.

He put his hands on her shoulders again, pushing her back against the
table, but he was grinning.  

"Come on, now, I need the locations of the bases.  I'll make it worth
your while. And I give you my word we won't tell the Cardassians." He
didn't need her to tell him the location of the clasps on her tunic
--he'd found those.  She shivered as the cool air touched her body.

"Shahana IV, on the southern continent."  She was pretty sure the Feds
knew about that one. "And in the asteroid belt of the Killarian system. 
That's all I know about."

"That isn't all, but it's a start," he said.  "Riker to Worf."

"Worf here," came the Klingon's voice from the comm badge near her 
chest.

"Check out what we have on the southern continent of Shahana IV and 
the Killarian asteroid belt.  Riker out."  He grinned at her again. 

"Computer, secure doors."

He slid her tunic from her shoulders.  It fell to the table.  She
slipped his shirt over his head and dropped it on the chair.She ran 
her fingers through the soft brown hair on his chest.  Then she draped
her arms around his shoulders and rubbed her breasts against him.  
He stroked her back and ran his tongue around the curve of her left ear.
She giggled, something she hadn't done in a long time.  He slid his 
hand around to stroke her right breast, then bent to cover it with 
kisses.  He ran his tongue down the outside of her breast, then up the
other side, brushing the hard circle around her nipple lightly with the
tip of his tongue.  She looked down at his dark beard against her pale
skin.  She closed her eyes.  He slid his lips down to her nipple now, 
surrounding it, flicking it lightly with his tongue, biting it ever so
gently, sucking.  Then, with a final lick, he broke the contact, 
straightening, looking at her with a mischievous glint in his eyes.

"Now, tell me the location of another base and I'll do the other one." 
Damn. She could probably have done better under Cardassian torture. Not
that she was complaining.

"The moon of the third planet in the Sophoran system."  Riker relayed
the information to Worf, picking up his shirt from the chair to do so. 
Mari ran her fingers through the hair on his chest,trying to 
concentrate on his muscles and not on the fact that she knew that base
had been abandoned.  Then he lifted her in his arms, carried her to the
other end of the table, away from the panel, and laid her down on it.
The combs and the remaining hairpins pressed uncomfortably against her
head, and she slipped them out, shaking her hair loose and lying back 
with it spread across the surface of the table.  He sat in one of the
chairs and bent over her left breast.  She gazed out at the stars.

When he had finished,doing the same thorough job as he had on the other
side, he cupped her right breast in his hand, squeezing it gently, and
then slid his hand very slowly, centimeter by centimeter, down over her
ribs and belly to the waistband of her trousers.  

"Another base," he said, grinning.  Mari was tired.  She gave the first
name that came into her head rather than considering her options and
letting Troi get the whole list.    Riker undid the clasp at her waist
with the facility of someone with a good deal of prior experience with
the various clothing fasteners in use in the Alpha Quadrant. He lifted
her hips and pulled the trousers off.They were loose enough to slip off
easily over her boots, which he left on.  He bent to remove his own
boots, then his trousers, easing the waistband over his penis.  She
raised herself on her elbows to have a look.  There was something just
not quite right about human penises--their somewhat greater length, 
about twenty-two centimeters in the present case, didn't really make up
for the lack of ridges.  Still, good hands and a good mouth were what 
really counted (for her, at least--maybe Klingon women were different 
in that respect, that would explain a lot).  Thus far, Riker had 
demonstrated considerable abilities, though the crucial test was still
to come--soon, she hoped, without any more questions.    

He lifted her just a little, moving her until her hips came to the edge
of the table. She rested her right foot on the back of the chair at the
end of the table. He stroked the inside of her thigh.  Then he knelt on
the floor and lifted her left leg so he could kiss the underside of the
thigh, his beard brushing her skin.  Slowly he moved higher and higher. 
She lay back, the medallions of her earring clattering against the hard
black surface of the table.  Part of her thought she ought to be doing
something, trying harder to distract him from his questions,but it felt
too good just to lie here,to forget about the battles behind her and the
prison to come, to forget about everything outside of this room,
everything but Riker's fingers on the one thigh and his lips on the 
other.

His hand and his mouth reached her sex at the same time, his fingers
gently spreading her lips.  She closed her eyes and stretched her arms
back above her head, feeling the cool smoothness of the table under her
as her vulva and Riker's mouth merged into one hot, wet whole. His lips
were soft against hers,his tongue explored each fold, flattened against
her, trembled. She fought off the orgasm for as long as she could.  She
didn't want this to end.  But it came, shaking her whole body.  She let
out a long,low moan, wondering whether the computer was recording it but
not caring.

   Riker wasn't finished with her yet.  He stroked her belly, at first
gently,then more firmly,pressing his big, warm hands against her flesh.

 He slid out from under her leg and stood and bent over her,kissing her
with his mouth that tasted of her.  He slipped his right arm under her
neck and stroked her breasts with his other hand.  She lay back on his
warm, strong arm and opened her mouth to his probing tongue.  His hand
journeyed slowly down her body to her thighs and up again.  She fought
to clear her thoughts, to reassess her situation, feeling her body 
responding again to his touch.  

     "Now, I want to know how many ships the resistance has," he said,
looking down at her.She didn't think he could keep this up much longer.
She sincerely doubted that answers to his questions were what he 
wanted most right now.  

"I don't know.  I doubt anybody knows,"  she said in a low voice, her
words turning into a soft moan as his thumb slid into her.  She raised
herself to a sitting position, pressing against his hand, wrapping her
right arm around the back of his neck.  She looked into his eyes.

        "On the table, Riker.  No more questions."

She watched his face.  She didn't have to be a telepath to read the
internal struggle.  Would he give her this little victory?

        He smiled and kissed her on the nose.

        "All right.  No more questions."

 She moved out of his way as he climbed onto the table and lay down on
his back, taking up most of its length. She stood a moment admiring his
fair, well-muscled body against its shining black surface.  Then she
climbed up and straddled him, sliding her warm and dripping vulva up 
the length of his penis, seeing his face relax as he abandoned himself 
to the sensation.  She took him inside her and lay down on top of him,
stretching her legs out alongside his, moving gently as his movements
under her became more and more forceful.His thrusts brought her back to
the brink and she twisted her pelvis against his,taking him as deeply 
as she could, feeling the pressure of his body against the most 
sensitive parts of hers.  She ran her fingers through his hair, 
disturbing its smooth Starfleet perfection.  He put his hands on her 
hips, pulling her even more firmly against him.They lay there together
on the table, seeking their pleasure in each other's bodies, their 
sweat mingling and dripping down to the tabletop.  She laid her head 
down on his shoulder,looking out the window into the vastness of space.

She saw the stars streak as the ship went into warp.
