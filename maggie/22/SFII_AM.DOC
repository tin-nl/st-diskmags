"In the not so distant future civilisation is under attack. 
Leading the forces of darkness is the evil mastermind Bison, 
who is determined to capture the minds and bodies of the 
world's greatest fighters for use in his maniac plan to 
conquer the world. The only people on Earth with the potential 
to stop him are Ken and Ryu, two powerful legendary martial 
arts warriors. Together they face the fight to end all fights.

The final Battle of good against evil is about to begin."

Well that is  what it says on the cover.

 "Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie" ,is as you might expect 
a "Manga" production, and once again "Manga" has tried to live up 
to it's name (Ñafter all "Manga" actually means irresponsible 
images, or words to that effect).

 The Plot as you can gather from the summary is yet another 
squeaky clean good guys versus twisted evil guys affair.  However 
unusually for this kind of animation the plot does not revolve 
around large muscular characters beating the living crap out of 
each other. No, it comes across as more of a chilling morality 
tale rather than the beat'em up fest the title suggests. This 
kind of plot has it's advantages though. After all compared to 
the live action movie, this plot deserves an oscar.

  Being a "Manga" title you expect quality artwork and animation, 
this delivers all that and more. You know an animation is good 
when you turn and say "Is that a photo, or is it drawn?", which 
is exactly what I did at several intervals during the movie. The 
animation is as fluid as any other "Manga" you care to mention, 
although don't expect the level of gore as in "Devil Man", or 
even "Akiara". As this movie tries desperately not to be totally 
fantasy.

 Unusual for a "Manga", this has a soundtrack of known groups 
including "Alice in Chains", "Transglobal"(who incidentally use 
STs, and even created one of their CD inlays using Spectrum 512), 
and "Underground", to name but a few.

 In conclusion, no matter what you do to it, its still (Ñand no 
doubt die hard "Manga" fans will make me very bloody for saying 
this) a cartoon, a Tom and Jerry, a Mickey mouse with knuckle 
dusters. Never the less it is an above average example of the 
genre.
