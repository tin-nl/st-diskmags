    THREE! TWO! ONE! ZERO!  BREAK  OUT  [By  Thomas Haines] has 
arrived!  Hurr- wait a minute... ( [a musing  thoughtful  silence 
ensues] Break Out.. Breakout.. Arkanoid, Batty, Brick-out, Multi-
Briques, Arkanoid II - the Revenge of Doh, Gem Breakout..) hmmm.. that 
name seems familiar.  Breakout.  B r e a k  o u t.  Yes, and even 
after that *dramatic* countdown, I  feel somewhat let down because 
it's YET another Breakout clone.  And what a bobbins game it is.

    Lets begin with the title.  'Break Out by Thomas Haines' (sick of 
it yet?). It's not exactly the most catchy,  original  title  ever to 
grace a Falcon Game. But the space between 'Break' and  'Out',  I  
think,  is an original addition, a change from the  old,  well-flogged  
'Breakout'  roll-off-the-tongue-style.  But separating 'break' and 
'out' may be  Thomas  Haines'  only break (Oh please -Ed) from 
tradition.  This is  not  the  Great  Escape,  this  is  not  even 
Cops 'n' Robbers, this is in fact Break Out - a bat, a ball, some 
bricks et voila!... 

   ..Break O

         .\ .t ./. 
           .\t/ . 
    Before we are  flung,  kicking  and  screaming,  into  the  
'game',  we are *treated* to an intro.  And what an  intro.   A 
scanned picture of a sunset over the sea, with a black,  thin  and  
very  unantialiased  logo,  is drawn onto the screen with a sort of  
circular,  clockwise  wipe.  *Truly* beautiful.  Then, in sync with 
the music (ripped from the  Plastikk demo) a 3,2,1,0 countdown ensues, 
perhaps in a pathetic attempt  to  create  some  tension,  or  maybe 
to load the 'effect'.  This effect is three rotating 2D vector 
squares, spinning inside each other, with a blue pacman chomping 
jerkily  in  the middle.  Why Pacman has made an appearance is a 
little unclear.  The coder  may  have hoped to throw a net of illusion 
across our impressionable eyeballs,  thinking  we would be confused 
and forget that the game is actually called Break Out.  However, he 
does not succeed and the whole effect just increases the feeling  that 
this game is passe and was probably played by bored cavemen, with a 
rock and the bones of their last meal.

    Okay, intro over we hit space and are unceremoniously thrust into 
the thick of the game.  Our senses revolt at the  sight that greets 
us.  Yes, it's our old favourite, the uninvited visitor: the Gem Fill, 
splendidly resplendent in white. We now wonder if Mr. Haines is  
actually  trying  to create the atmosphere of an ancient Atari  FREE  
Gem  game  special,  because  he  is  certainly succeeding. [Except 
that everyone knew when Atari  made  crap  games they were actually 
only calling a double bluff to outfox Bill Gates and get him to copy 
the games and so kill Microsoft off from inside.  Or something.]

    There are two different tiles which  you  must  hit  with the 
ball.  One of them is white and filled  with  a   bobbly  Gem  Fill  
(this tile needs two hits (usually, but there are some bugs))  and  
the  other is an insipid maroon colour which hardly shows up against  
the  background.   And talking of the background, it's that old 
favourite scanned true colour picture of a mountain and some water 
used in the Camera demo  by  Sentry  and  an  Impulse  demo called 
Angest.. well 'hackneyed' seems to be Thomas Haines' middle  name,  so 
I guess we shouldn't be surprised.

    The bat is a crude lump,  filled  with  the  oh  so delicate white 
Gem Fill (cycling as well this time ..mmmmm mmm)  and  the  ball is a 
hideous lurid green colour.  It all brings a new meaning to the 
phrase: 'assaulting the senses'.

    So, onto the game itself.. it starts with  the ball on the bat, 
right mouse button releases it and left  mouse  button  pauses  the  
game  .. ?!!  The bat's movement is very sensitive, so we  are  soon  
being treated to the legend: 'Life Lost'.  "One down, only two more to 
be endured," we mutter.

    The bounce of the ball is so consistent that as the game draws to 
a close - there being perhaps two or three tiles  left  - it becomes 
very difficult to hit them and whether anyone can be bothered to  
spend the time needed to achieve the completion of the level is highly 
doubtful.  I was reaching for the reset button when I remembered my 
obligation as  a  games  reviewer and the sacrifices I must make for  
the  greater  good,  so  on  I  battled..  (that  is  battled  with my 
eyelids..).

    Eventually the level was completed  and  I  was rewarded with a 
fanfare-ish sample and some  words  so  mundane  that  I've  forgotten  
them,  but they were probably akin to: You Win!  And that was that.  
The first level turned out to be the one and only level.  But we 
should  at  least thank the coder for putting us out of our misery 
reasonably quickly  and  not prolonging our suffering any more than he 
already has by being born.

    So, you may think  the  review  ends  here.   But  you  would  be 
SO wrong. Because there is more to Thomas Haines' Break Out than 
merely one level, done on a ripped background, with Gem filled tiles 
and repetitive samples which give you a headache after ten seconds 
because... 

  ...there is an option to create  your  own  Break Out levels!  
However I fear that Mr. Haines must have been somewhat shy of this 
feature because I only found it out after extensive  reading  and  
deciphering  of  the readme_1st text which comes with the game (in 
which  you  will  also  find  a  short story which ON NO ACCOUNT 
should you read).  In this text we  are told that button 'c' will 
access the level editor, and should be pressed on the 'intro' part 
(which incidentally, the game reverts to when you have  lost  all  
your lives).  So I duly played and lost a game of Break Out and then   
waited  for the intro to reappear.  After an unreasonable delay it 
crept  back  guiltily,  doubly  so  because  I  had to sit through the 
*exciting* countdown bit again.  So finally when Pacman was restored 
to his place of honour I pressed 'c'.

I waited.

I waited some more.

I pressed 'c' a second time.   Still  Pacman chomped away undisturbed, 
musing on the nuances of his life as a minor character in a minus 
game.







 
[Some time later.]

A ha!  Mr. Pink has just had the idea  that maybe 'Caps Lock' has been 
turned on and the code is not recognising a  capital  'C'  as the 
requisite small 'c'.  If so, it must be a nice VGA  specific  bug  
[with  the game] because on Mr. Pink's nice RGB Atari monitor he 
doesn't  have  any  trouble (apart from that caused by the 
aforementioned game).

    Pressing 'Caps Lock', then 'c' meets with success, but I'm afraid 
this game has already failed its test on grounds of being completely 
bobbins.

    The Break Out 'level  editor'  is  no  slick  Reservoir Gods' 
Double Bobble Editor.  It has obviously been bundled together  as  a 
last gasp resort to spice up a done-to-death game and is more crude  
than the entire repertoire of the Viz cast in the eyes of  Mary  
Whitehouse.   Right  mouse  button cycles through the three available 
tiles, (one of which is  a  blank tile to delete with) which are 
displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen and that memorable 
green ball makes a reappearance as the mouse pointer.   You draw 
whatever design takes your fancy, then 'Return' will save the  new  
level  to  disk (it actually saves over Thomas' original level. 
**What** a shame.)  and  then  you play it.  You can see the fruits of 
my effort as well as  my  verdict  on this game by clicking on the 
little SEE PIC icon.  Go on, you know  you  want to, [as The Divine 
Comedy might have said].

People who wish to get  hold  of  a  copy  of  this  game  are  
advised to see a psychiatrist.
