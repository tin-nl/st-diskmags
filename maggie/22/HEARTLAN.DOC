This is the latest effort by Tony Greenwood and co.. It follows hard on 
the heels of 'Island Strike', reviewed last time by us, and is by the 
same team as before.. What has changed from last time, you might be 
entitled to ask..

Well quite a lot.. This is the 'Sonic type' game promised to us back in 
issue 20 of Maggie by Tony Greenwood when he gave us his interview.. 
This promised several advances for any ST game of this nature, even not 
taking into account that the language to be used was STOS.. A language 
unfortunately still looked down upon in some quarters..

Compared with Island Strike, the standard of presentation is very high 
indeed, well up to the sort of gloss that you would get from a good 
commercial release.. A nice title screen gives way to a well laid out 
and drawn menu selection system whereupon you can click to go into the 
game.. Such things as 'End Game' and 'Outtro' screens have also been 
drawn very well indeed, and it's hats off to the artist Dean Chadwick 
there!! (Loud applause)

The standard of graphics in game does not drop either, as you get a 
potato shaped sprite (the 'Dizzy' character) running around for you in 
a platform maze which puts the sixteen available onscreen colours to 
very good use.. The maze design is the usual run of ramps, sheer drops, 
platforms and 'walk behind' bits where you are partially hidden from 
view by the landscape.. These are all very well drawn, and reminiscent 
of the 'Sonic' game on the ol' Megadrive.. The levels also tend to be 
on the huge side of things..

No hang, on, the *H U G E* side of things!!

Which is one area that Tony G. promised would leave all other ST games 
pawing ineffectually in their wake.. The scrolling, otherwise known as 
the 'up and down bits' to non-technical people, is also super-smooth, 
even on a standard STFM and even in those difficult to get right 
horizontal and eight-way combination aspects.. Again, another 'first' 
for STOS, and a relative rarity even for most assembly language ST 
games.. Turrican is one that springs to mind, but it is conspiciously 
not a STOS game.. On the Falcon, it runs very fast, perhaps too 
quickly, although a version with extra unspecified enhancements is 
promised for that machine..

Hardware it runs on includes the STFM (1 meg), the optimum machine is 
really an STe (1 meg) as you get some extra sound effects over and 
above the chip-generated stuff, particularly a nice little tune made by 
a looping DMA driven sample.. The Falcon really runs it too quickly and 
loses out on the sound as it uses the wrong part of the soundchip or 
something..

Plotwise, Tony wisely gave up after the first couple of sentences, but 
to summarise briefly.. Your potato person has to look for some cards 
out of a deck of cards, the set of hearts, to be really precise.. This 
is where the wandering around the huge virtual platform maze bit comes 
into it.. You are looking for cards scattered around the maze, magic 
doorwar or portal type things that take you to another part of the 
maze, and scattered coins to pick up, to get your name on the high 
scores.. There is not a lot stopping you apart from clumps of 
strategically positioned bobbing spikes, and an energy bar which runs 
out if you take in too many of the spikes, and err, that's it..

The major playability component of the game seems to be the exploration 
aspect, without too much 'interactivity' with the bad guys.. This plays 
more like a demo than a full game, and I feel that something might be 
missing somewhere.. There are no bad guys to avoid or kill, and no real 
traps or classic timing puzzles of the sort that you might get on a 
game like this.. One example is the puzzling appearance of a load of 
spiked balls, which look like they ought to be swinging around in tight 
arcs, and threatening to clobber your sprite if you mistime your walk 
through them.. However, they sit there dumbly as part of the general 
background scenery..  

As a demo of Tony G's programming prowess, Heartland hits the spot, and 
we look forward to whatever he is doing next (probably the 'Monkey 
Island' type graphical adventure he mentioned briefly to us a while 
back..) As a game, it still needs a bit more to add to make it 
complete..

ÅRatings..

Graphics:- 85% - Pretty good for standard ST, very professionally 
presented as a whole..

Sonix:- 77% - Good combination of chip sound effects, and DMA generated 
background music (on STe)..

Playability:- 78% - Hangs together really well, and a pleasure to move 
around.. Not too much variety at the end of the day though..

Overall:- 83% - A good game displaying signs of a possible great game 
to come from the team in the near future..

Echoes of Stario's Christmas?? This one arrived courtesy of Tony "I'll 
just get this Xmassy themed game out before Xmas" Greenwood with a note 
asking if it was too late to go into Maggie 22 for a review..

As I have explained to different people until my lips are turning 
purple from oxygen starvation, nobody is *ever* too late for an issue 
of Maggie.. That is unless you happen to be called Mike Noyce and like 
to send your articles by E-mail, but that is a whole different story as 
they say..

This is the widely speculated follow-up to Heartland promised to us by 
Tony G. This seems to be a quick exploitative follow up to that game, 
using the same game engine with suitably wintry graphics and jingle 
bells playing in the background.. 

On the other hand, Tony has gone to the trouble to develop the concept 
quite a bit further, as this game contains rather more in the way of 
things to do than Heartlands did..

For the plot, quite a bit more going on, as you (Dizzy, er Sassy) have 
just successfully completed Heartlands, but find out that some annoying 
person has just pinched the fabulous Ice Diamond and hidden it.. You 
have to travel through various platform levels to recover said Ice 
Diamond (allegedly easy) and find the means to free it from its 
imprisoning ice (not so easy). On the way there, various characters are 
interacted with, and favours done for them in order to complete parts 
of the game maze, with several 'sub-missions' to carry out..

A large part of the appeal is down to the talking snowmen, penguins, 
eskimos, and mad old men that you meet on the way.. Many come out with 
comments that are amusing but don't help you finish the game, some 
characters are helpful, some a lot less so.. One cunning dead end can 
be found mid-game involving the eskimo versions of the brothers Grant 
and Phil..

In terms of the game mechanics, rather than a frantic run around a maze 
at high speed, (very high speed on the Falcon) like you get with 
Heartlands, this game is a lot more structured and you are led to 
certain parts of the maze in order to complete the tasks set before 
you..

Actually, this game plays a lot like the old Infocom Hitchhikers Guide 
text adventure, where if you did not complete an earlier bit of the 
game correctly, you got fatally stuck later on.. It is very easy to get 
stuck, and attention to detail is important in playing this.. I haven't 
managed it yet..

Tony must have got the puzzle element right, because it is attention 
grabbing in that 'just one more go' kind of fashion.. On the other 
hand, Maggie dealines might just mean that I have to reach for the 
so far hidden cheat mode at the end of the day..

Technically, very similar to last time, but with the welcome addition 
of proper Falcon fixing.. In spite of Stosser Soft assurances that this 
was ready-fixed for my kind of Atari, it still took a run through 
Generic Fixer to get it sorted.. Maybe this only took TOS 4.04 into 
account.. The other recommendation that this be run through 'Backward' 
was also modified in practice as 'Diamond Ice' was able to run from the 
desktop from hard drive with the help of 'Falcon SX', the hardware 
switcher desk accessory set to STe bus, processor cache off, and 8mhz.. 
The added convenience of hard drive access made this game vastly more 
appealing than might have been the case if I hade been restricted to 
floppy only booting..

Graphics and sound, well not a great deal of difference from before in 
overall quality.. The 'winter wonderland' theme work very well for a 
game of this type, and are generally very appealing.. The sound 
contrasts sharply with the very subdued chip sound effects, and the 
looping sample which booms loudly out, and hijacks your living room.. 
It is possible to toggle this off, but if you 'save' and then reload a 
game position, the sample reappears in all its loud and gaudy glory..

In spite of these minor points, Tony Greenwood has come up with another 
hit game for the ST series.. One which promises more than ten minutes 
worth of effort to solve it..

ÅGraphics:- 87% - The graphics got just a little bit better than last 
time, loads of snow, reminded me a lot of 'Fire and Ice'..

Sonix:- 67% - Similar combination of Soundchip spot effects and DMA 
looped sample as Heartland, but the looped sample is just a little bit 
too loud and obtrusive this time..

Playability:- 87% - Aha, a decent plot at last.. Plenty to do for 
puzzle freaks.. More linear and structured than Heartland..

Overall:- 88% - (Game Developers motto) If you're doing a sequel, take 
the trouble to make it just that bit better than first time around..
