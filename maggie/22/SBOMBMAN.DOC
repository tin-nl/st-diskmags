                     SUPER-BOMBER MAN [PREVIEW]
oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO

Perhaps the most cloned game on  the Falcon is Super-Bomber man. These 
imitations are probably  inspired  by  TSCC's  excellent Dynablasters, 
probably the most entertaining Falcon game ever created.

This version of the classic Hudsoft game originates from France. It is 
created by Marc Bourlon aka Archangel.  He  seems to have spent a long 
time working on this quite simple game,  but  one look at it shows all 
the effort has not been in vain.

On booting you are straight into the  main menu. Here you get to setup 
the game how you would like.

Up to six players can compete in this  game and you can set the number 
of competitors from 2-6. You can also  set the control method for each 
player. This can be joystick, powerpad or a predefined set of keys.

On this main menu you can  also  choose  the  start level. There are 5 
different levels to choose from. Each has  its own set of graphics and 
starting setup for the players.

The game itself is set on 15x15  grid  so the whole screen area is not 
used. The maze feels a bit small in coparison with Dynabusters. To the 
right of the play area area 3  bombs.  Each  bomb has the score of two 
players emblazoned on it.

At the bottom of the screen  there  is  a  "Super Bomber Man" logo. It 
also displays the name of the coder  and the company that inspired the 
game - Hudsonsoft.

To the left of the logo  are  two  clocks, one of the analogue variety 
and one of the digital variety. This displays the time left before the 
level ends. You have just 3 minutes on each level before armeggedon.

When armeggedon  begins,  the  level  begins  to  close  in.  An  ever 
decreasing square of  skull  tiles  surrounds  the  maze,  killing any 
players that come into contact with it.

The characters  themselves  are  nicely  designed.  They  cast  little 
shadows over the background as they move. There moved is perhaps a bit 
too free - they can move  up  and  down in the corridors. This freedom 
makes it awkward to change direction sometimes.

Also the sprites are actually slightly  too  big  - their heads pop up 
above the current corridor they  are  in  making it difficult to judge 
collision detection.

When you blow up blocks you can recover one of four types of tiles:

BOMB - Increases the number of bombs you can lay 
FLAME - Increases your bombs range 
SKULL - Random effect 
ROLLER SKATE - Speed 
BOXING GLOVE - Power up

Picking up the skulls are always a gamble.  They can be a benefit or a 
handicap.  Skull  effects  include   speed-up,  slow-down,  no  bombs, 
automatic bomb dropping and small explosions.

The graphics and presentation in this game is excellent. The animation 
for  burning  tiles  is  especially  good.  The  different  background 
graphics on different levels provide much needed variety.

Super Bomber-Man has the  potential  to  be  another great multiplayer 
Falcon game, we are just waiting for the final version to explode upon 
the scene.
