                           CONFUSIONS INTRO
                    A SMALL DEMO FOR THE ATARI ST 
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-
 
I don't know too much about  the  origin  of  this  intro,  when or 
where it was released but I do know that it  is  of  Polish  origin  
and I must thank Grey of Shadows for sending it in for review.

The Confusions intro is an ST  one,  I  don't  think  it is STE 
specific, but it certainly steadfastly refuses to work on the Falcon.

The intro begins with the now cliched waving flag of dots. Even Graham 
Taylor is getting fed up with this effect  -  he  exclusively  told  
Maggie "Do I Dot Like That!". However it is refreshing to see it 
bearing a different design, this time it the symbol of Poland being 
displayed.

Some chirpy music plays merrily in  the  background,  revealing itself 
to be the warbling tones of Beast from Syndicate.

We are now introduced to  the  main  effect.  I  think  there  is top 
and bottom overscan, although this is difficult to tell on my monitor. 
In the top border is an 8x8 1 plane  scroller  which  gives  some  
info  about  the  demo. In polish, obviously. Below this we have the 
central attraction of the demo...

...wait for it...

Shadebobs.
In the same way that crap 80s pop  bands  are  now "big in japan", 
crap 80s demo effects are now obviously "big  in  Poland".  So  first  
we have some pink shade bobs. Then blue, red and green.  As  we  cheer  
for more, the encore of ice-blue shade bobs appear. The waveforms 
aren't that brilliant and show little variation between screens. At 
one point the screen  isn't even cleared properly and we get a 
flashing dot in the top right corner. Shade-dots anyone?

Finally the shade bobs end and a nicely drawn picture of spiderman 
appears. This is probably the highlight of the demo.

Whilst it is great to see the burgeoning  east European atari scene, 
it would be nice if they tried  a  bit  harder  to  come  up  with 
some interesting effects. Apparently the 8-bit intros were a lot more 
impressive than the current batch of ST stuff. Lets hope the XL/XE 
coders bring their undoubted talents to the ST and Falcon and give the 
16-bit men some inspiration.

For the moment though, the land of confusion is total (shade)bobbins.
