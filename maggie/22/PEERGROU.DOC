Oversweetened conversation, often            Unsweetened conversation,
multilingual for the sake of                 lots of swearing for the

9. And another thing..

Which of the two groups would be handiest in a fight? At first glance, 
the Punks would seem to be able to walk all over the Bloomsburys with 
ease, but the Bloomsbury Set could call on some of their surviving war 
poet mates who had extensive experience of some of the more gentlemanly 
conduct rule-bending techniques of trench warfare in between penning 
their anguished prose.. They were probably quite handy with a bayonet 
in a hundred ways to make the most hardened film censor turn green and 
rush for the lavatory, even if they didn't like to admit it.. The 
Bloomsburys probably could also call down long-range directed artillery 
fire as well, although they might spoil things by giving the orders 
down a field telephone in ancient Greek.. This would be a more even 
contest than first impressions might suggest.. We'd rather not attempt 
to predict the eventual outcome..


10. And finally..

If you fit the descriptions given on both sides of the preceding pages, 
then boy, are you in trouble, you Bloomsbury/Punk hybrid!!
