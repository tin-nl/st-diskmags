This one is a cardgame, albeit, a cardgame with a lot of options and 
brilliant presentation.. Rummy 500 plus is an Atari cardfest that makes 
the Windows solitaire seem ill-advised and amateurishly put together..

Rummy 500 plus refers to the scoring system, where the winner has to 
get to 500 points first, although the plus option allows the player to 
extend this, so there could be games of Rummy 1 million if you felt 
really silly.. This version allows to to play alone against the 
computer on a variable intelligence setting, or else against other 
human players with an online option for modem games included, for those 
multiplayer fans who find that Sub Station is beginning to pall a 
little bit for them..

Presentation is wonderful, with a unique and never to be seen elsewhere 
start sequence.. This is a clever animation parody of the standard GEM 
desktop with the red cat of the title escaping from the trashcan..  
Technically this can co-operate with a wide variety of Atari machines, 
with everything from a bog standard STFM (1 meg) to the Falcons of this 
world.. Each TOS version has its own version of the program file, but 
the end product is the same wherever..

The in-game interface is non-GEM and totally custom, with a decent turn 
of speed.. Graphics are attractive if a little functional, and there 
are various sampled sound effects to help matters along..

Playability, seems fine to me, but I have a mental 'block' about most 
card games, the same mental processes also exclude things like 
understanding magic eye pictures and higher mathematics.. So the game 
could play like a dog for experienced card players, although I doubt 
it..

As far as I can see, card game devotees will love this one, especially 
if they can make use of the online modem option.. Perhaps a general 
'take turns at the keyboard' two player option for people in the same 
room wouldn't have gone amiss..

Small points aside. One to look out for if small coloured pieces of 
card are your bag..

Any enquires should go to the rather oddly named fellow below;

   Thomas J. Starace (JR)
    73 Rush Street
     Port Jefferson Station
      New York 11776 (USA)

I believe he wants 21.99 US dollars for the full commercial version.. 
You also have to tell him what TOS version you've got if ordering the 
full game..
