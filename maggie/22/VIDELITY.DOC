Titan have been busy again.. Not content with providing one of the very 
best art and animation packages for the Falcon, several lines of 
brilliant hardware, and exciting new updates to their products, they 
have ventured into the screen enhancer market, a place dominated by a 
few well-known products..

Brief recap follows:

Since day one of the Falcon, it has always been possible to expand the 
screen resolutions available.. This is due to the Videl custom chip 
built into the Falcon, and in theory, almost any screen resolution is 
possible, providing the monitor can cope.. To avoid the very real 
possibility of damage to many less flexible screens, Atari decided to 
limit what resolutions were available from the desktop.. Other 
compromises sort of imposed themselves too, particularly with reference 
to the Truecolour mode and SVGA screens.. Even useful to have, and non 
threatening features such as borderless overscan on RGB screens, were 
'hidden' and only opened up by third party patch programs.. It is not 
surprising that developers at all levels took up the challenge of 
expanding what the Falcon could show onscreen..

Compo were first with their Screenblaster package, a combined hardware 
and software solution.. This was shown as early as the official UK 
launch for Falcon at the February '93 16-Bit Show.. The next major 
effort came via System Solutions, and their 'Blowup' package, this made 
the hardware element desirable but optional.. Various other smaller 
patch programs also came out, the most noteworthy of these being 'Videl 
Inside', one of the few to cater for RGB monitors as well as VGA type 
displays..

Bringing the story right up to date is the Titan/Black Scorpion effort, 
Videlity, which attempts to build on what has been learned over the 
past few years, and add a dash of the professional finish for which 
Titan have justly become famous for..  

The finished version will retail at a very reasonable œ14.95, it will 
also be bundled as part of the forthcoming 'Apex Alpha' package..

In the meantime, we are able to report on Videlity from the point of 
view of an advanced beta test version, which is pretty complete, and 
just needs fine-tuning..

Videlity consists of two parts, the main program which can be 
autobooted or run, and sits in the background, patiently waiting for 
the next component, the configuration menu, to do its thing.. The 
configuration menu is a very sleek looking affair, with a selection of 
mouse controlled slider and button controls.. Of importance, are the 
various horizontal and vertical refresh rates, double line modes, pixel 
adjusts, a 4-3 aspect ratio button to get nice even screen sizes, the 
vital monitor safety lock to avoid setting a screen mode outside of 
what your monitor is capable of, and some others we'll discuss in a 
minute or so.. 

Initially, the configuration menu did give some beta test problems to 
RGB users like myself, but these were taken care of, and separate VGA 
and RGB default values are now available.. In terms of what is 
available, 'Videlity' is reported to work miracles with (S)VGA type 
screen hardware, with resolutions in the 800 x 600 bracket for 16 and 
256 colour mode, and even 400 x 304 pixels in Truecolour mode, 
apparently not possible on the non-commercial screen enhancers, and 
only with difficulty on things like Screenblaster..

On a very bog-standard Philips type RGB monitor, the competition 
consists of Videl Inside, and is a bit more even, as you get 
approximately the same sort of screen resolutions, RGB allowing for 
much higher pixel values at Truecolour, but with the same sort of 
ghastly flicker as you get from the Atari provided interlace screen 
modes.. A lot of this is probably due to the design and performance of 
the monitor itself, which is very inflexible in certain respects.. With 
this type of interlace display, static pictures always come off looking 
a lot better than text and menu bars..

Where Videlity scores over the rest, is firstly, in its vastly superior 
configuration menu.. Videl Inside has a range of preset screen modes, a 
fiddly and ill-documented 'DIY' screen mode feature, and that's it.. 
Also, Videlity does not come into play unless you go into the specified 
screen mode, and quite happily returns you back to where you were when 
you change back, unlike Videl Inside, which permanently changes the 
desktop.inf file, necessitating a reboot and fiddling about to change 
it back afterwards.. As a general rule, Videlity can be left 'on' 
safely in your auto folder, the risk of incompatability with other 
applications is small..

Videlty has a couple of other useful features that bear more than a 
casual examination as well.. It is able to make use of existing 
Screenblaster or Blowup hardware to provide even better displays, and 
an option on the configuration panel recognises this.. Even better, 
from a lot of peoples viewpoint, is the option to enable and use 
'Nemesis', the soon to be available accelerator board, discussed 
elsewhere.. The higher CPU and bus speeds allowing for higher 
truecolour resolutions on (S)VGA particularly..

Videlity promises to be another quality product from Titan, and at a 
very reasonable price.. On balance, it is going to be of more use to 
(S)VGA or multisync monitor owners than to RGB users, but even there, 
Videlity does have a lot still to offer..
