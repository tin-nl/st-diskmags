(NOT QUITE) THE LAST OF
 THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DISK MAGAZINE ROUNDUPS!
 Part 1: "AAUSAC" to "DNT Paper" 
 by Richard Karsmakers

 Amended and taken over with official Karsmakers blessing by us!

 In ÅST NEWS Volume 7 Issue 2 the first version of this disk 
magazine roundup appeared, and about one year later (in ÅST NEWS 
Volume 8 Issue 2) I did a revised version. In Volume 9 Issue 2 
you could find the re-revised version and in Volume 10 Issue 2 
there was a re-re-revised edition. This fifth occurrence is the 
final revision to be released through ÅST NEWS; after all, this is 
the last issue. Updated versions of this roundup Ñmight find their 
way onto other disk magazines and/or onto specific WWW pages.

 This revision contains 129 entries as the non-Atari specific 
online efforts have been deleted, with two important exceptions, 
but ten new diskmag entries have been added. (Nov 1996)

 I have refrained from trying to include all online magazines 
(like the hundreds of different Net Digests, to name but one 
common class of examples), and instead only included the ones 
that may be of interest to general Atari TOS users.

 Thanks need to go to Dave Mooney and John Weller of "STEN" (even 
though they r.i.p.) for the original idea back in '91 or '92 
somewhere, and a lot of other people (mainly disk magazine 
editors, Paul "ST Applications" Glover, James "He's Got The 
Power" Matthews and e-zine list compiler John Labovitz) whom I 
can't possibly all start mentioning here. Cheers to all you guys!

ÑMaggie note:- We've taken over the rights to redistribute this 
one, and a number of changes have been made.. The fiction/general 
category online E-zines have been taken out to focus more 
specificially on the Atari aspect, there are a few new entries 
and major status changes for certain existing magazines as well..  

ÑSummary of major changes since last time:-

New mags added, Atari Times, Falk Mag, Focus diskmag, Fun (ex 
DBA), Kelstar, Stestosterone, Smeg, ST Highway, ST World, and 
Warezine..

Major status changes to existing mags, DBA closed down, Falcon 
Update digital closed down, but with prospects of rebirth, Power 
Diskmag confirmed dead, ST Beermat confirmed not alive.. Various 
other minor changes regarding issue numbers for currently running 
publications also updated.. On the good news front, Undercover 
Mag seems to have come strongly back to life again.. There is 
also a major info addendum to the entry for STampede, the ill-
begotten commercial diskmag by Jengrove Enterprises, which brings 
that story round full circle..
=================================================================
 Status: Mentions whether the magazine is Public Domain,
 shareware, commercial or whatever else is possible.
 User interface: Does the mag have a user interface of its own?
 If so, what's it like (very briefly)?
 Latest known issue: The latest (or last) known issue of the
 magazine. This particular information is limited to my own
 knowledge and it therefore not infallible at all!
 Address: The address (standard mail address and/or email) where
 the editorial staff may be contacted. If the magazine is dead
 this is considered irrelevant.
 Health: Is the magazine still being released or has it, let's
 euphemize,Ñ passed away already? Interestingly, there are also a
 few in-between possibilities.
 Language: What language is (or which languages are) used in the
 magazine? 
=================================================================
 
AAUSAC

 A disk mag by the Association of Atari Users in Schools And 
Colleges. It is put together by a chap called Terry Freedman, and 
its aim is to bring together teachers and lecturers who use the 
Atari in their work.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. An old version of the Newsdisk shell.
 Latest know issue: Number 1.
 Address: 45 Douglas Road, Goodmayes, Essex, England.
 Health: Alive? 
 Language: English.

ACUSG

 A disk magazine that came from a London Atari ST user group. At 
least 2 issues are known to have come out, but they probably 
ceased existing after Volume 1 Issue 2. Articles were tiny 
(displayed in dialog boxes, for crying out loud), and accent was 
put on programs that could be run from the shell. The last known 
issue (i.e. Volume 1 Issue 2) was released in June 1987.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one that was, let's face it, bad.
 Latest known issue: Not certain; probably Volume 1 Issue 2.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Amazine

 A disk magazine that used to be made by the demo coders Mad 
Vision (who seem to be French, Belgian and English). User 
interface used to consist of a menu where you could type the 
number of the article you want to read. Later issues had a mouse- 
driven menu. Quality of English varies considerably depending on 
who authored a particular article. Loads of humour (BBS and 
internet-sourced material). Strictly Underground and probably 
fairly illegal. One of its earliest issues was reportedly sent to 
F.A.S.T. (the Federation Against Software Theft) by MicroMart. 
Very odd. In January 1993 Mad Vision left the ST scene and the 
magazine was supposed to be taken over by the Hemoroids, but 
wasn't (they are now on Amiga).
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 4.
 Address: Not important.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Atari Digest

 These are messages and discussions taken off UseNet and 
consequently edited. It is primarily focused on American 
interests, and a treat for the technically interested. If you 
have a look at their 'latest issue', below, you will see it's a 
number that suffices to let you know how long they've been going 
on and at what approximate frequency it appears.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Last documented one is 206. Probably more.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Probably still alive.
 Language: English.
 
Atari Dream Machines

 A magazine dedicated solely to Jaguar and Falcon. Editors are 
Timo Gietschel and Gilbert Koch, who fill it with interesting 
facts, though all in German. A text displayer is supplied, too, 
which enables you to check the magazine (which is one huge text 
file). The text displayer uses interlace on RGB, which kindof 
sucks. Contents make up for it, though.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Just a basic text displayer.
 Latest known issue: Issue 6 (March 17th 1996).
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: German.
 
Atari Explorer Online

 When, early 1992, a magazine called "Z-Net" (Cf.) started 
working together closely with the regular paper magazine "Atari 
Explorer", this on-line magazine was founded. Most of the "Z-Net" 
staff went to work for this mag afterwards. Around New Year 
1992/1993 Ron Kovacs resumed publication of his "Z-Net". "Atari 
Explorer On-Line" went on with a new editor, Travis Guy.
 This magazine, incidentally, was often referred to just as 
'AEO'. It was sortof released twice per month (though it had been 
a bit slow during its last year or two) and contained lots of hot 
inside information as far as Atari was concerned. They also did 
special extra dedication issues. Sometimes they got very big with 
lots of information and renditions of entire Genie Roundtable 
Convention stuff. Quite incredible.
 When you had a subscription to AEO, you automatically got the 
Atari Programmer's Journal, a somewhat more technical compendium 
sort of thing that was released once every few months or so. This 
also included UUencoded source material at times. Additionally 
you also got special Jaguar-related issues, "AEO News" issues and 
occasional occurrences of special "CES" issues.
 One of the last Atari magazine strongholds, "AEO" ceased to be 
in spring of 1996.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Volume 4 Issue 9 (January 1st 1996); the
 Atari Programmer's Journal latest incarnation is issue 4 (March
 31st 1994); the Jaguar Edition latest issue is #3 (May 20th
 1995); the latest AEO News issue is #4 (June 18th 1994). The
 latest "CES" issue is "Summer CES 1994".
 Address: No longer relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Atarimagasinet

 This is a bi-monthly "ST Guide" hyper text disk magazine aimed 
primarily at the approximately 200 users of the "Atari Users of 
Norway". The first issue was released in December 1993, after 
which it appeared four times in paper. A year of pause then 
ensued due to editorial health problems. In spring of 1995 it 
arose again, now as a disk magazine. It is done by Stein Arne 
Jensen.
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: None. You have to use "ST Guide".
 Latest known issue: Issue 04/95, October 20th 1995 (the fourth
 on-disk issue).
 Address: Atari Users of Norway, c/o Stein Arne Jensen,N-3630
 Radberg, Norway.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Norwegian. 
 
AtariPHILE

 A new magazine in the Atari world, and this time an HTML-based 
one on the World Wide Web. The first issue was released in early 
spring 1996. Focuses on the sort of slightly more serious and 
informative end of things Atari. The editor is Colin Fisher 
Mcallum, the man behind the Whitchurch-based 42BBS (01256 895106) 
where it is also downloadable from..
 Status: Public domain, Web site.
 User interface: Well, doesn't really apply, does it?
 Latest known issue: Issue 4. (Dec 1996)
 Address: http://www.walusoft.co.uk/fff/home.html (which is where
 the magazine itself is located). Also see 42BBS number above.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
Atari Power Entertainment Online

 This is a monthly online addition to the "Atari Power 
Entertainment" magazine. It's about Lynx and Jaguars, and I 
believe the first issue was released in April 1994.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Issue 3 (July 1994).
 Address: APE Newsletter, 2104 North Kostner, Chicago, IL 60639,
 USA (send a letter here and you'll get a free ish of the actual
 magazine with an added subscription form). The email address is
 c.smith89@genie.geis.com.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
Atari Star

 A disk magazine about which nothing was known for a long time 
except that it was supposed to have released its first issue on 
March 30th 1994 and that it contained sections on computer- 
related and non-computer-related stuff, interviews with authors 
and more. In fact, however, it is thought that no maiden issue 
ever appeared before it died Ñin utero.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: None.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Never born, allegedly.
 Language: Had it properly started, it would have been English.

Atari Times

Formerly the Croft Soft newsletter, reporting on the activities 
of the Croft Soft team who write various games and small 
utilities for the Atari range in a similar manner to say, 
Reservoir Gods, but concentrating on the ST/STe series. From 
August 1996, they decided to expand the newsletter into a general 
diskmag, and Atari Times was born. It is similar to AtariPhile in 
that it uses an HTML-based front end, but the contents are a bit 
more focused on the entertainment end of things, with a little 
self-promotion of Croft Soft. It has been available monthly, but 
is more likely to be bi-monthly at the moment.
 Status: Public Domain
 User Interface: HTML-based
 Latest known issue: Issue 7 (Nov/Dec 1996)
 Address: Colin Polonowksi, The Croft, Hope Road, Nibley, nr Yate
 Bristol. BS17 5JH
 E-Mail: cpolonowski@fffnet.demon.co.uk
 Health: Alive
 Language: English

Trivia note:- They actually started at issue zero, so there have 
been eight issues of Atari Times/Croft Soft newsletter to date.
 
Atari United!

 Or "AU!". A special preliminary issue was released through 
STeve's Software at the Glendale Atari Show in the US in 
September. It offered news, reviews, press releases, program 
demos, public domain software and any other information that 
might be of interest to owners of Atari TOS computers. It had a 
custom interface written by Bry Edewaard and Scott Ettinger. 
Compatible with any ST/TT/Falcon, using any 80-column resolution. 
Managing editor was Gordie Meyer. It explicitly permitted user 
groups to republish its material provided credits were given. 
Articles were extensive and well-written, and bonus archives 
containing ZIP archives filled with goodies were also to be found 
on the disks. All articles were in one file that is loaded on 
startup.
 Status: Commercial (4 issues per year, US$ 4,95 a piece or US$
 16,00 a year).
 User interface: Yes, a custom one that's quite smooth and
 entirely GEM-driven.
 Latest known issue: Issue 2 (Winter 1994).
 Address: P.O. Box 1982, Ames, IA 50010-1982. Might no longer be
 valid.
 Health: Alive, though comatose in expectance of Atari to enter
 the computer industry again... Might, actually, be quite dead.
 Language: English.
 
Atari Update

 Another latecomer to the world of ST disk magazines, and perhaps 
a slightly superfluous one. Articles seem uninspired and don't 
cover a lot of new ground. The editor is called David Pettifer. 
It is said that it merged with another magazine (which one?) 
after issue 1.
 Status: Public Domain (originally intended as shareware).
 User interface: Yes, the "NEWSDISK" shell.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1 (August 1994).
 Address: Dynamic Publications, 22 Brook Road, Shanklin, Isle of
 Wight, PO37 7LU, England.
 Health: Alive? Merged with another? Dead?
 Language: English.
 
Atari Yamaha User (A.Y.U.)

 A bi-monthly specialist disk magazine for users of MIDI, filled 
with relevant MIDI information and software reviews. It's put 
together by a guy called Graeme and it's supposed to be really 
excellent. Doesn't have an own user interface, though - you have 
to read the articles from the desktop of using a text file 
viewer.
 Status: Licenceware (ú2.50).
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Issue 4.
 Address: Unknown.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
ATOS

 A German hyper-text kind of disk magazine, of which the name 
stands for "About TOS". It can be installed as an accessory. No 
hands-on experience.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a hypertext one.
 Latest known issue: 2/95.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: German.
 
Auto-Mation

 A British (?) disk magazine that started late 1993. Initial 
impression have been quoted by a PD library to be "very good and 
worth a look anyway". No hands-on experience.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Not known.
 Latest known issue: Volume 1 Issue 1.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Probably alive.
 Language: Probably English.
 
Big Night Out Magazine, the

 An English magazine, colour only, edited by Paul Bramwell of The 
Corruption Software Group. It contains lots of short articles. 
Cute music, nice demos.

 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Number 2.
 Address: 28 Woodlands, Seaham, Co. Durham, SR7 0EP, England.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English. 
 
Bite

 This is supposed to be the follow-up - or reincarnation if you 
will - of "ST Enthusiasts Newsletter" (Cf.), edited by Jake 
"Caledonia" Bain. It uses the same shell and the contents are in 
the same approximate vein, though with more of an accent on stuff 
taken from the Internet and less featurings of editorial 
writings. It's stocked solely by Caledonia PD Library, and they 
produce it too.
 Status: Public Domain? Their PD disks cost ú2.50. 
 User interface: Yes, the "STEN" one (Cf.).
 Latest known issue: Issue 1.
 Address: 250 Oldtown Road, Hilton, Inverness, Scotland, IV2 4PT,
 UK.
 Health: Alive?? Might only be a one-off?
 Language: English.
 
BOMBA

 A Hungarian disk magazine, now deceased, about which little is 
known otherwise than that two of the people who now do "COMA" 
(Cf.) used to be in its editorial staff in 1992.
 Status: Presumably Public Domain.
 User interface: It probably had one.
 Latest known issue: I guess they made one at least.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: One of the few certain things - it's dead.
 Language: Hungarian and/or English?
 
Central Atari Information Network (CAIN) Newsletter

 Not a whole not is known about this one. It is the newsletter of 
the Cleveland Free-Net Atari Special Interest Group. Has the 
latest news of all Atari stuff, including Lynx and 8-bit.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: No. It's on-line.
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 4 (April 1995).
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: American.
 
CIP ST

 This was the magazine of a German user group, done by editor 
Ulrich Veigel. The last documented issue that got out was issue 
4, of May 1988. The program has an own shell which consisted of a 
large program in which all articles were integrated. Article 
loading times, thus, were nonexistent. Loading the program took 
quite long, though (it would, wouldn't it?).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Number 4.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: German.
 
COMA (COmputer MAgazine) 

 Like "BOMBA" (Cf.), a Hungarian disk magazine. It's not clear 
whether it's ST or Falcon or possible even multi-format 
(including Amiga and PC). The first issue was released in 
September 1992, and it's made by at least two of the original 
"BOMBA" people (which folded).
 Status: Probably Public Domain.
 User interface: Probably has one.
 Latest known issue: Volume 3 Issue 2 (7th issue in total).
 Address: Unknown.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Hungarian and/or English?

Croft Soft Newsletter

(See 'Atari Times' entry.)

CSC

 Nothing known about this, except for the fact that at least one 
issue was made and that it's in French.
 And that it actually exists, of course. Or maybe existed.
 
Daily Error

 Probably abortive attempt at a great magazine, said to be French 
and the replacement of another magazine (name unknown). It looked 
too much like I demo, is claimed.
 Their pre-issue/demo was released around 1991.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Very custom, yes.
 Latest known issue: The demo.
 Address: Irrelevant.
 Health: Dead. Actually they never lived.
 Language: English.
 
DBA Magazine

 A widespread, very popular Dutch disk magazine with a user 
interface akin "Maggie" (the new version). "DBA" had this kind of 
menu before "Maggie", they claim. Custom music, nice menu, smooth 
working, multiple musical pieces, good graphics, intuitive, OK. 
 They write in English but one of the submenus is devoted to 
Dutch stuff which makes it stand out among the others. They tried 
doing monochrome versions back in the ST days, but they remained 
colour-only until they became Falcon-only. "DBA" released the 
first issue around October 1991. Issue 4 is a compilation of 
stuff that appeared in issue 1, 2, 3 and 5 (yes, strange 
chronology but true nonetheless). Their recent issues - up to 
issue 9 - have taken up two disks. Issue 9 was the first attempt 
at Falcon compatibility and as of Issue 10 it's Falcon only (and 
supplied on a HD disk). Issue 12 was, massive, supplied on two HD 
disks. It was a Magnetic Interlude co-operation with "Maggie" 
(Cf.) and "ST News" (Cf.). Issue 13 was a compilation of the best 
bits of issues 9 through 12.
 The only thing not totally perfect about "DBA" is that perhaps 
many of its articles are a bit bland and the English tends to 
have its own biorhythm where general good quality is concerned. 
They have different fonts but don't support text styles. Issue 11 
is a transformation preview kind of thing to a potentially 
totally renewed shell.
 Unfortunately, DBA as a group somewhat lost their way in the 
spring of 1996, when the main editor Slimer, dropped out of 
contact.. However, remaining members of DBA and other Dutch 
groups have gathered together under a new group called 'Fun', and 
plan at least one more issue using the latest version of this 
shell, in addition to several other projects on the Falcon..
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: A smooth and nice-looking custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 14 (November 1995).
 Address: N/A, he's not answering!
 Health: Dead but reincarnated. (See 'Fun')
 Language: English, with one column in Dutch.
 
Digital Disk Magazine

 Multi-format (ST/Amiga/PC) magazine, proclaimed non-elitist (you 
don't have to be in a demo crew), offering coverage of topics 
such as Network News, Digital Art, 68000 tutorial, Software 
Reviews and, yes, short stories. All different formats have a 
core of the same articles with added platform-specific stuff. It 
also offers PD programs and music modules. It is distributed as 
"Magic Shadow Archiver" file, and its editor is Steve Hill. The 
first issue was released August 1993. As of issue 4 it's 
subscription only, which will set you back ú8 for 4 issues or ú20 
for 12.
 Status: Public Domain before Issue 4, sortof commercial after
 that.
 User interface: A GEM interface, not too brilliant and very
 slow.
 Latest known issue: Christmas 1993. Other source claims "issue
 5" (I am not sure which is the latest).
 Address: 85 Ceres Road, Plumstead, London, SE18 1HL, England.

 Health: Alive?

Digital Games Digest

 A modem magazine that concentrates on games reviews for all 
formats (including PC, ST, Amiga, handheld, consoles, etc.). Its 
editor is Dave Taylor.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: Unknown.
 Address: Email taylor@limbo.intuitive.com.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
Discbox

 A disk mag that took a 'new' approach to the concept, by showing 
the articles as "Degas" pictures through a slideshow program. 
Articles were extremely brief, and about 40-50 pics (i.e. screen 
pages) appeared in one issue. Lots of the screens were dedicated 
to ads for the people who put it out, which are the Prophecy P.D. 
Library folks. Colour only.
 Status: Commercial.
 User interface: No. Well, maybe 'yes' - a slideshow program.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Disk Magazin

 A short-lived initiative by Timo Schmidt, who after that became 
one of the staff writers of "Maggie" (Cf.) for a while. "Disk 
Magazine" was published in German, and had a user interface that 
was, certainly by today's standards, very clumsy to work with.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: German.
 
Disk Magazin

 Apparently there is a second disk magazine of this name, this 
time produced by none other than The CareBears (TCB). Haven't 
seen it myself, but it's said to be bland and not much worth 
reading. Even considering the status of TCB it was disappointing.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 1.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English and another language (Swedish?).
 
Disk Space 
Å
 Though still suffering from the odd bug in its fresh user 
interface, "Disk Space" is a promising disk magazine that we're 
likely to hear more of in the future. Its editor is Jason 
Reucassel, who has nothing against publishing lots of fiction in 
his mag - good idea!
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 2. This is quite old by now, actually.
 Address: 10 Stewarts Way, Marlow Bottom, Marlow, Bucks SL7 3QL,
 England.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.
 
Disk Times

 A Finnish disk magazine, but thank God (in whom I don't believe) 
it was written in English. It used to be produced by the 
Universal Coders (UNC), but they either seemed to have renamed 
into Armada or these new guys had taken over. Lots of humour and 
stuff, good soundtracks (they use tracker music). Some people 
found it a bit childish, though.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one like a large rotating drum.
 Latest known issue: Volume 1 Issue 5.
 Address: Unknown.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Dizzy Diskzine

 This is not so much a regular disk magazine as a sort of disk- 
based (non-official) Dizzy Games helpline. The 'magazine' is 
updated once every couple of months and includes all cheats and 
solutions to the Dizzy games ("Treasure Island Dizzy" and the 
other Dizzy Codemasters games). They're done by Chris M. Banham.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: None. Just text files.
 Latest known issue: Not applicable. Latest 'version' unknown.
 Address: 36 Chestnut Avenue, Euxton, Lancs PR7 6BS, England.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
DNT Paper


 "DNT Paper" is a high-quality French disk magazine. It started 
off in July 1991 with a user interface that was quite slow and 
had a lot to improve upon. At that time it was published by Flips 
(Philippe Henrotte) and Pips of DNT Crew. The user interface 
started improving as of issue 3. Then, with issue 4, the magazine 
proclaimed its death. Issue 5 followed, however, and several 
issues after that as well. As of issue 7 it also works on the 
Falcon, at which time the editorial staff changed and Nullos 
(Sylvain Langlade) took over. It works only in colour 
resolutions.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 7 (April 1994).
 Address: 62 bis, Rue de l'Oradon, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand,
 France.
 Health: Alive, sortof undead.
 Language: French and English.
