Ñ"Jurmaggic Park" - or how certain individuals reacted to the famous 
dinosaur flick which was shown on the telly over Xmas!! 

ÅCiH..
"Eat the children and make it slow, nice n' crunchy, yum yum yum!" when 
the Tyrannosaurus Rex escaped from the park..

ÅMr Pink..
"Well what do you expect of an amusement park that is run on Apple 
hardware, and a pretend UNIX O/S that thinks its a flight sim??"

ÅFelice..
Is already writing up his travel report for Maggie 23.. Yes, he was 
really there!! No, honest!!

ÅTat..
"I think that the dinosaur graphics could be done better, with some 
nice plasma whorls on the Falcon.. The new Avena 'Dino-Demo' is to 
follow this spring!"

ÅRipley..
"Hang on a minute, this isn't 'Alien 4'???"
Å
Ed Cleveland..
"Those Raptors wouldn't last a minute up our way.. Bunch of tarts with 
their fancy southern ways, we'll have 'em!!"

ÅKev (SH3)..
"I prefer Manga.."

ÅKev (Taff)..
"Coming next time, 'How to stick a brontosaurus in a tower case'!!"

ÅMike Noyce..
"Most of the surviving dinosaurs have retired to the coast down here, 
and it's murder at the post office on pension day!!"

ÅArto..
"Yes, but are they *French* dinosaurs?!"

But perhaps the last word on the subject should come from our latest 
contributor, Jody Smith..

Well actually, that last bit was sort of made up by me, but I hope it 
is a reasonably faithful stab at the sort of thing that Jody would say 
anyway.. I think.. (CiH)

The relatively normal bit where we thank the rest of the folk that 
contributed to this issue..

Dave Hollis, for standing still long enough to be interviewed..

Rich Karsmakers, for being very forthcoming with his interview..

Arto, already mentioned him..

Dave Encill, keep up the good work mate!

Martin Wilson, cheers again pal..

-----v-----

The even more normal than the last bit, bit, where we greet and 
dedicate to various other people.. (In order of memory lapse!)

Pieter van der Meer, for Neurobotix, and the very positive E-Mails.. 
Look forward to seeing more from you soon!
Ñ
Mike James, we want more Seenyor Dadzz, and we want 'em now!!

Janez Valant.. Hi there!!

Absence, well it's goodbye from them, but at least they got the Joint 
Venture demo out..

Atari Computing Magazine, a great production.. Treat us gently when you 
come to review this Maggie issue Joe..

The folks at WAG, especially Chris Crosskey who owns the weirdest 
custom-built ST anyone is ever likely to see!!

Bonus, for keeping things going.. Let's see 'Fun' soon!

Bob Kell.. Might see you at the Scottish Atari show in Spring??

Tony Greenwood, loved the new games! (Does this count as a valid 
feedback response??)

Keefy, are you still out there??

VoGue, ditto..

Mike Goodman, for keeping the Atari Shows going..

The 'Year 2000 Bug', a superb reason for junking your Windows 3.1 PC!

Nintendo, who must have been afflicted with a version of this bug, as 
they think Xmas day falls in March!! Loved the 'spoiler' adds for the 
N64, "Get buggerall now, but wait 'till March and buy an N64!"

The Observer newspaper, for their 'clever' and 'objective' reporting on 
Internet affairs..

I think I'll go away now..
