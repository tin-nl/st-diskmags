Maggie interview with Richard Karsmakers.. 

Producer of the 'Ultimate  Virus Killer'  
Ex-editor of the legendary diskmag 'ST News'!!    

„There's an interview of sorts in a really early issue of Maggie, but 
this fills in with a lot of later info not seen there, so whattheheck!


> Can you give us a brief run-down of your life so far (where you were  
> born, which schools you attended, etc) ?

I was born in a town in the South of the Netherlands by the name of 
Helmond, which literally means "mouth of hell" as it is due west of 
what used to be a swampy area in the Netherlands. Shitloads of  people 
drowned there in the early middle ages or thereabouts, so it  became a 
settlement to cater for people who wanted a good night's  sleep and a 
beer or two before setting out on what was then certainly  a journey 
fraught with danger. The town has a pretty bad reputation, which it 
gained in the last 10 or 15 years, insofar that it's  sometimes 
considered to have an crime rate that's even higher than that of 
Amsterdam.

I went to four schools in Helmond, first primary school and  then, 
after a two-and-a-half year's stay in a child's home because  my mom 
didn't like me and eventually my parents divorced, I went  through 
three levels of secondary education, the lowest through  to the 
highest. This is pretty unusual, because my primary school tests had 
proven that I was capable of tackling the highest level right away, but 
what with my parents being divorced people (social  workers, whatever) 
didn't reckon I could handle all these changes. So I crawled up the 
ladder of our secondary education system for  two extra years. Like 
"Red Dwarf"'s Arnold J. Rimmer, I was the  oldest in just about every 
group I was in. This was particularly  burdensome for me, as I usually 
got along better with people a bit older than me and I tended to be 
bossy over ones that were younger.

In 1988 I went to University in Utrecht, my choice having been  
prompted by the nearness of the infamous Willeke's domicile. I  did a 
year of Biology until I found out it was no sirree a step  onto 
becoming a paleontologist (I'd wanted to dig up dinosaurs ever since I 
was six or thereabouts). Too much physics and chemistry,  and 
eventually my being forced to tackle integral calculus, made me  throw 
the towel in the ring with some force. That was March 1989, a time when 
"ST NEWS" was blooming like never before due to Stefan's efforts 
combined with mine, and when the "UVK" was selling in  seriously 
interesting quantities.  

Around that time, Stefan and I visited Thalion software and I decided 
I'd really like working  there. Jochen "Mad Max" Hippel was one of my 
heroes, and the other people were really good at their thing, too. I 
wanted to be part of  that young and budding company, never mind it 
being in Germany. So, after the summer holiday, I went to work for 
them. I did some game  design, translations, correspondence with the 
press, Public  Relations abroad, and gaping at our gorgeous secretary, 
Manuela. It was one of the most interesting periods of my life, though 
at a  certain moment - summer 1990 - the future of Thalion was not at 
all certain so I set into motion the cogwheels that eventually got me 
back  to Utrecht and starting to study English in September 1991. 

Apart  for the occurrence of my second (and hopefully final) 
girlfriend,  in August 1994, my life has been pretty inconspicuous ever 
since.  I've been going through the various years and courses of my 
English  studies at Utrecht University, I specialised in Celtic 
Language and Culture, and graduated in December 1995. 

Realising that there's no dry bread to be earned as a simple Master of 
Arts, I enrolled into a course to get me qualified as a teacher  in 
secondary education, something that I would have laughed  hilariously 
if anyone had predicted it a mere year or two earlier.  

I am right in the middle of the final segment about now, meaning that I 
have 10 hours per week to teach kids varying from 12 to 16 years  of 
age. It's tiresome and at times rather unthankful work, but I think  
it's the thing for which I was born. I should get my certificate at the 
end of December, after which I hope out to eek a living as a  teacher 
whilst trying to get discovered as a writer of fiction.


> Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems  
> have you owned?

When I went from the lowest to the intermediate level of secondary 
education (for the Dutch among you: MAVO to HAVO), my dad thought  I 
ought to get a computer. Although mention was made of a Sinclair  QL at 
the moment, eventually I ended up requesting a Commodore 64.  I spent 
the next two years spending rather more time playing games  and ripping 
music than doing school stuff. Around Easter 1986 I  switched to the 
Atari ST, back then a 512 Kb system with TOS on  disk, an SF354 single-
sided disk drive and a monochrome monitor. 

I got upgraded, traded in for a MEGA ST2 extended to 4 Mb in  1990, and 
traded in in October 1993 for a Falcon. Hard-disk wise,  I started off 
with an SH204 (20 Mb), which at the time seemed  like reams and reams 
of space, and super speed. Via a Megafile 60  in the MEGA ST I 
eventually ended up with a more satisfactory 340  Mb IDE thing in the 
Falcon.

Somewhere in 1989 I purchased a Cambridge Z88, a really nice piece of  
machinery, that I haven't used for a bit now as the cable to port  
stuff from/to it wasn't Falcon compatible. In a cupboard I also  have a 
Commodore 128D to play the really old classics, and for a  month or so 
I've owned a second-hand Sinclair QL, and for about 3  hours I owned a 
VIC 20.


> What do you think of the Atari scene in general??

With the risk of sounding sentimental, the scene the way it was  when 
Stefan and I did the "ST NEWS International Christmas Coding  
Convention" in December 1990.  This  was the coolest, friendliest, 
weirdest, most talented and craziest scene I've ever seen. Even  though 
I was never a programmer, I was proud to be part of it in  some 
insignificant, fleeting way. Things won't be like that,  never again, 
certainly not on the PC. People like TCB's Nic and  Tanis, TLB's 
Manikin, those crazy Frenchies of Overlanders and ST  Connexion, and 
those absurdly talented people like TEX' Mad Max, ES  and -me-, they 
were the icing that made the scene a great one.  Obliterating borders, 
sync scrolling, getting good sound of the  crappy YM 2149 chip...those 
were the days. 

Today, the scene is one  that I can hardly identify with. Too many 
Germans, too many  Frenchies, a lack of cool friendship (TCB <> TLB 
comes to mind),  no sense of humour, too much house music, and parties 
that, from  what I've read and heard, are just too big, not cosy. I 
have  basked in the glow of coding gods, and with me a great multitude  
of others. Nic, in my eyes, was the best coder ever. The day he  left 
the old scene, it died.


> Which demo, in your opinion, is the best you've seen on either the 
> Falcon or ST??

I was never much into Falcon demos, though Chris sent me a few  that 
were quite impressive. No doubt, awesome stuff is being done,  but I 
can't judge it properly because I don't really know what  the Falcon 
can and can't do. Having been in Thalion, and designing  games that 
would take a regular ST pretty close to what it could do  (and seeing 
games designed that took it even a bit closer and  further, like the 
amazing "Enchanted Land", programmed by Nic), I think I can judge ST 
demos better. 

The "Union Demo", without a  shadow of an inkling of a scintilla of a 
doubt, was the  best-designed demo ever, featuring some incredible 
coding by the  best people from the scene. The most enjoyable demo, 
however, will  forever be "B.I.G. Demo", which was exactly my kind of 
thing.  Later demos, such as "Mindbomb" and "Ooh Crikey Wot a 
Scorcher",  will also have a fond place in my Atari heart, whereas the 
Last Of  The Great Megademos, "Froggies over the Fence", was another 
major  achievement!


> What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc)

It doesn't exist. PCs have taken over the place. There hasn't been  a 
good Atari user club ever since ST Club Eindhoven turned to  Apples in 
1988 or 1989, just after Frank and I had left it. I have  never seen a 
Falcon anywhere except my own, and those in shelves  at Atari Benelux 
and the current Atari wholesaler, ACN (maybe  that's a bit of an 
exaggeration, but not too much of one).


> Which computer show(s) or parties do you have fond memories of?

I've only really been to two: The "STNICCC" and the Delta Force  "ICC 
#2". The first one was, sorry of this sounds conceited or  arrogant or 
whatever, the best ever, at least to me. Catering was  excellent, the 
location was excellent, and every single person in  the scene was 
there, except Oxygene (then of TLB, a.k.a. In Flagranti)  and -ME- of 
TEX (who has an exam the Monday afterwards). It was  super.

I should like to mention the "party" that happened when the Lost  Boys 
came down to Thalion to program "A Prehistoric Tale". Dave  (Spaz) and 
Manikin (Tim) had come down for the summer, Jochen was  doing the 
music, and Steffen "New Mode" Fischer and Fabian "Oxygene" Hammer were 
doing stuff, and Stefan was there to do a bonus screen,  and we all 
slept on the old Thalion office balcony, outside in the  summer night, 
until the street cleaners below would wake us up.  We'd get drunk many 
times, going to beer-gardens and get  shit-faced. Although it wasn't 
actually a "party", I certainly  experienced most of it like one.


> What is your opinion of diskzines on the Atari scene?? 
> (ie Maggie, ST Plus, etc)

I am only really familiar, I have to confess, with "Maggie" and  "DBA 
Magazine". It's a damn shame that the latter seems to have  stopped; 
even with Bonus wanting to release a final issue, I am  not sure 
whether they'll pull it off, as Sietse "Slimer" Postma  was better at 
the whole editorial thing, English spelling, the whole  lark. It takes 
more than just "an inclination" to finish a disk  magazine issue, every 
time again, it takes a kind of quiet  desperation, a lot of stamina, 
maybe sheer bloody-minded  stubbornness. "Maggie", right now, is the 
one thing that keeps the  scene going, kindof like a central nerve 
system, or maybe just glue.  It's good at being the drive of the Atari 
scene, thankfully.


> What is your favourite TV show ??

Multiple. Because I am doing this secondary school teacher course,  I 
tend to watch the odd episode of "Heartbreak High" of late. I  like 
some American cliche police stuff ("Nash Bridges" comes to  mind), and 
a lot of the British humour ("Red Dwarf", of course, the  "Air Scotia" 
thing, loads more), "The Muppets Tonight", and a  Dutch soap called 
"Good Times, Bad Times", which features what I  think might be the most 
delectable Dutch female, a girl called Katja  Schuurman (your Dutch 
readers are probably splitting their sides  now but, hey, taste is 
something personal). I really dig all  those American talkshows that 
portray silly or downright annoyingly  stupid people, broken families, 
druggies, teenage pregnancy, etc.  (Jerry Springer, Ricki Lake, Jenny 
Jones). Makes me really  appreciate my own life, it does!


> And your worst TV programme ??

I am not aware of anything like it in Britain, but it's something  
called "Reality TV". This basically means that a bunch of cameramen  
listen to the police and fire brigade frequencies and then film all  
the shit that happens. Fucking outrageous, very annoying, and on TV  in 
some or other guise on the various commercial Dutch challenge as  if 
the TV-viewing audiences want nothing else.


> What is your favourite movie of all time??

Very difficult, as there have been so many masterpieces, in  various 
different genres. In serious genres, a film like "The  Crying Game" or 
"Out of Africa" would score high, but when I go to  the cinema I want 
to see some really spectacular stuff, and there  "Jurassic Park", 
"Twister" and "ID4" are the top three. Never mind  the story, suspend 
your disbelief, and let yourself flow along with  the film as long as 
it lasts, then leave the cinema awed and with a  feeling that, if 
nothing else, you've been entertained thoroughly.


> What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen??

I don't even want to get into the tripe that's on TV most of the  time, 
so I'll limit this to stuff I've actually gone to the cinema  for. I'll 
be stepping on the toes of artsy-fartsy people here, but  it would have 
to be "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", which I  saw on my birthday 
in 1988, with (the infamous) Willeke. It was an  exceedingly boring and 
overly long film that I might have been too  young for to actually 
understand. Maybe it was my mood, I don't know.


> Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies??

Fave actor is Robert de Niro, although I also like Arnold and  
Sylvester in the rather more empty-headed action film genre. Jack  
Nicholson, though he seems to end up playing similar roles all  the 
time, is cool too. I know I am a sexist pig of a man, but I  rate 
actresses not by their acting capabilities but, rather, for  the way 
they look and the size of the chance of my not kicking them  out of my 
bed if ever they turned out to land up in it. Kelly  Preston ("Twins") 
and Imogen Stubbs ("Eric the Viking") are awesome,  and Famke Janssen 
too (though not in "Goldeneye", but the ST:TNG  episode where she 
plays). Cliche answers like Julia Roberts and  Sharon Stone don't got 
for me; Julia's mouth is way too big and  Sharon's too dominant and 
aggressive-looking, though she was OK  in "Total Recall".

If I had to pick an actress for her acting merits, I think it would be 
someone  like Meryl Streep, who can do anything but humour. She's 
amazing.
 
> Who or what do you find everyone else seems to like, but which you
> personally loathe intensely ?? (this can include the Spice Girls!)

Spice Girls? I hate their music, but when there video clips are on  I 
just can't tear away my eyes (especially the one with red hair  in the 
clip that is a bit like "Power Rangers"...and have you  noticed the 
other clip is *one* giant shot?)! Possibly the male  pig of a man angle 
again... But no, seriously, especially since I  am teaching, I notice 
that simply every secondary school pupil  seems to get off on house 
music of some kind of other. And the  girls all like "BoyZone" and that 
crap. I hate that kind of more  fervently even than I hate 
Country'n'Western!


Some words, people and places to react to ... 
(please be as frank as you like)

Canada

A serious possibility for future exploits, at least potentially, as  
far as both Karin and me are concerned. Mark "666" van den Boer,  
Stefan and Gard "Nutty Tiny One" Abrahamsen have gone before me  
already.

Piracy

A blessing and a curse. None of the old 8-bit systems would have  been 
anywhere near the success they were if it weren't for the  "I can get a 
lot of games from my friend who has one too"  phenomenon. I think this 
is also what makes the PC attractive to  many people nowadays. However, 
I think there should definitely be  a big "no-no" plastered on those 
commercial ventures like Pirate  CD ROMs or generally everybody SELLING 
illegal software. I can  understand people copying software, but I 
can't understand people  SELLING the stuff, SELLING other people's 
labour. And back when  I was working at Thalion I could get very worked 
up when people  cracked Thalion titles (such as Empire, Hotline and 
Replicants  did), what with Thalion consisted just about consisting 
only of  people who were highly respected and esteemed in the Atari 
fraternity.

Censorship

My guts cry out: Never ever! Censorship is bad! However, sometimes  I 
think censorship is good, especially on the Internet. Especially  
people of average (or even below that) mental capacity are capable  of 
the utmost horrific things if they get access to all that there  is to 
know in the world. I can't think of an actual example off the  top of 
my head. Closely related to censorship, especially on the  Internet, is 
"youth and pornography". For starters I think regular  pornography 
(without tying up, defecation, extreme fetishism and  physical abuse) 
is something that people are way too hung up about. „(Ed note:- I think 
we might have hit upon Richard K's major area of expertise here!!!) 

Probably one of those inherently hypocritical American things, and  
unfortunately most people on the Net are American. This "password  ID 
whatever check" scheme on sites containing adult material is a  good 
one, I think. The power of the Internet should not be  underestimated. 
I am convinced it can cause the downfall of people, or even whole 
nations, in due time.

Stefan Posthuma

Great guy, great friend, inhabitant of Canada, co-singer of "One"  on 
the "ST NEWS Home Vid'", important person in the development of  "ST 
NEWS", The Lost Boys and the entire old ST Scene.

Infamous tabloid newspapers

I wish we had them here. I don't want all that seriously depressive  
shit on my breakfast table, or at least not that stuff *exclusively*.  
Some spectacular 'news' stories and a pair of big whoppers on Page 3,  
I am certain, would brighten a person's outlook on the day ahead,  and 
make the world a marginally more witty place.

Independence Day (the movie)

A story that has as many holes as the movie has explosions.  
Nonetheless, a definite must-see, and in the cinema at that, not  on 
video. I had successfully managed to suspend my disbelief for  the 
entire film, right up to the moment when this guy writes a  virus (in 
what seem like minutes) and then infects the alien  mothership, as if 
whatever his processor/machine code was is actually  compatible with 
the alien thing. Me being the sexist pig bastard I  am, I have to say 
that the Prince of Bell-Air's girlfriend was  pretty much of an 
attracting factor in keeping my eyes glued to  the screen :-)


> What is your most favourite book of all time ??

Right now I would say "Birdsong" by Sebastian Faulks, a "book of  love 
and war", a disturbingly realistic account of life just  before and 
during World War I. I have never read a book that  discomforted me this 
much, and it's written in a way I would like  to be able to write. The 
guy's a natural. Having said this, I  would definitely want to put in 
Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" and  everything ever written by Terry 
Pratchett and Douglas Adams, as  well as Stephen Donaldson's 
"Unbeliever" chronicles. And Stephen  King, of course, whose "The 
Stand", "Needful Things" and "It"  are definitely somewhere in my over-
sized top 10.


> If we were ever to visit you (ie, myself and Chris Holland), where  
  would you take us for a night out??

Never thought I'd ever be on the *replying* side of this question :-)

Utrecht is a pretty old, scenic and *compact* city. At 20 minutes'  
cycling from my place is located the city centre, where you'll find  
all the decent record shops (for a day out) and cinemas and bars  (for 
the night). There's a hard rock cafe called "The Boot Hill  Saloon" 
which I find quite enjoyable, where they play Motorhead  and Van Halen 
and that kind of thing, and there's "Stairway to  Heaven", which is a 
"rock cafe" although the loudest thing they  play is U2. Their walls 
are lined with golden records (Beatles,  Aerosmith, lot more) and 
signed electric guitars (Van Halen,  Megadeth, Sepultura, U2, and 
dozens of more). Really nice place  to gawk at the walls, but then we'd 
quickly run off because it is  definitely "average Utrecht people" 
domain after 9 PM. Not a  "rock cafe" at all, apart from the ornaments. 

I am not sure if  you'd like any of these cafes, by the way. But we 
have a really  cheap Greek/Italian restaurant called "Mr. Jack's" where 
all  pizzas are about 3,25 pound sterling and the food is good, though  
the service can be lousy, especially if you're there with a group  of 
people. This was the place, formerly called "Zorba the Greek"  where 
Stefan and I got enchanted by Agapi, the Greek Goddess, so  which a 
Volume 3 issue of "ST NEWS" was dedicated. Yesterday I ate  there with 
Karin, as a matter of fact, and there was a similarly  pretty waitress 
walking around.


> Who is your favourite musical group?

Various, but Dream Theater would have to rank as number one. For me  to 
really like a band, they have to make good music and, preferably,  be 
able to play their instruments really well (on both accounts,  bands 
like Blur, Pulp and fuckin' Oasis go out the window straight  away). 
Dream Theater is made up solely of people who are among the  very best 
of playing their respective instruments, and some of  their songs are 
just pure classics. Yesterday I emailed my Top 10  Albums of all times 
to some guy who was doing a survey, which will  also give you a glance 
across my musical taste:

Albums:
1. And Justice for All - Metallica 
2. Made in Japan - Deep Purple 
3. Awake - Dream Theater 
4. Perspective - Jason Becker 
5. Queensryche - Operation Mindcrime 
6. Passion and Warfare - Steve Vai 
7. Alive II - Kiss 
8. Exit Stage Left - Rush 
9. Live after Death - Iron Maiden 
10. Rust in Peace - Megadeth


> Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet??

OASIS! The way the guy sings "Wonderwall" is like he's not having  a 
good time... try replacing the words with "I wanna go home...I  am 
having a lousy time..." ('WeirdAl'alreadyhas...ED)and see  how they 
fit! The fact that they're so huge all around the world  and people 
seem to find it all the rage to seriously dig this band  just makes me 
get angrier and more incredulous. The world is not  what it used to be. 
People used to like the Beatles a lot, or Abba,  but it's been nothing 
ever since...


> Who is your favourite music singer ??

Male: Geoff Tate (of Queensryche) and old Ronnie James Dio (when  he 
was in Rainbow and Black Sabbath). Female: Bjork (who also looks  
frightfully cute for a 30-odd-year-old, and I simply *adore* her  
Icelandic accent!). And when Mariah Carey gets those high notes  so 
flawlessly, my gonads contract in ecstasy!


> Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection?

Er...I usually buy a CD when I intend to listen to it more than  once, 
though my music collection (over 600 CDs and over 100 CD  singles) 
sometimes makes that a bit difficult. But the CDs that  I have listened 
to most in the last few months are Orphanage's  "By Time Alone" (groovy 
doom metal with grunt and soprano vocals),  Therion's "Theli" 
(symphonic doom metal with church choires and  grunt vocals), Theatre 
of Tragedy's debut (doom metal with grunt  and soprano vocals), Steve 
Vai's "Fire Garden" (new excellent  and long CD, with half instrumental 
guitar music and half with  vocals) and The Gathering's "Mandylion" 
(groovy metal with soprano,  who is lovely too). A CD I would like to 
listen to more often but  that always affects me emotionally is Jason 
Becker's second solo CD  (made after his disease started), 
"Perspective". It's simply  beautiful and very, very touching.


> Thanks for your replies, Rich - hope everything goes to plan.

You're welcome. I had expected some more unusual questions (although 
not quite  like the ones I sometimes asked, like "what do you think 
when you look at the  moon?"), so if you get some more inspiration, 
feel free to ask some more! All the beST,
