…Webspace Preview 

„New Web Browser from Oxo Concept!!

This is only the second really serious attempt at a fully capable HTML 
browser, first mentioned in Maggie 21, and making some pretty big 
claims for itself.. Oxo Concept have described this as superior to the 
competition, with two claims for it standing out..

Firstly, Webspace is described as being much faster than the 
competition, and certainly, offline loading in of a HTML file seemed to 
be very quick.. Online, we can't comment, as this demo version was only 
enabled for offline use.. Webspace has options for external internet 
modules such as STiK, but we wonder if later versions will come with 
their own internet connections built in..

Secondly, Webspace is described as having a full implementation of the 
differing HTML protocols, including full Netscape support, Frames, and 
later versions of HTML etc.. Again, we could not really test this out, 
as the only HTML files we had easy access to, were CAB friendly.. 
However it is worth noting that CAB is also evolving all the time to a 
full HTML standard Web browser, and that a lot of the features on 
Webspace were still only pencilled in to be added in for a future 
update..

To look at, Webspace is very similar to CAB, in that it is a GEM based 
package, using a system of pulldown menus and a row of icons along the 
top of the screen to control the program.. The program is dependent on 
the screen resolution set by the user, preferring more colours and 
higher resolution if these are available..

Webspace still has a long way to go in a lot of areas.. It is not very 
stable, and sometimes prone to stop working mid-page, which doesn't 
really recommend it just yet for general online use.. The display is 
often untidy looking, and sometimes produces some strange results if 
non standard screen resolutions are used, sometimes even if fairly 
standard screen modes are used.. You get some strange font sizes, very 
tiny in places, and text deposited over a picture when it clearly 
shouldn't be.. The display seems to have an unfinished look to it when 
a document is displayed..

A lot of little touches that make CAB convenient are missing here.. You 
don't get many options to user define such as font sizing, and setting 
up the graphic display internally, such as a greyscale option for 
limited colour displays.. CAB also dynamically fits the page if you 
resize the window, Webspace does not do this as yet.. CAB is also 
multilingual, at least you can swap between different language resource 
files, at the moment, Webspace consists of English for the menus, with 
touches of French in the icon bay.. Webspace, for all its loading speed 
keeps you waiting until a document is fully loaded, CAB allows you to 
start scrolling down the page whilst it is still loading in..

The differences between Webspace and CAB reflect the fact that one is a 
mature product relatively higher up in its development cycle than the 
other, which is still at a very early stage.. I wouldn't write off 
Webspace yet, which will be a hell of a package if its authors claims 
are ultimately fulfilled..
