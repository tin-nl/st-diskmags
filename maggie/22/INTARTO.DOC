From deepest Paris, France, comes an interview with Arto, 
formerly of Hydroxid, who did us a superb intro for Maggie 21 ...


Can you give us a brief run-down of your life so far (where you were 
born, which schools you attended, etc) ?

I was born in Paris (15th district) and I have lived in the suburb of
Paris. I followed a classical school way except while I entered to 
University where I learnt Computer-Science for 1 year.  At IUT Paris V 
the next year I studied English at the University of Cergy Prefecture. 
Now, i'm a lazy guy who expect to be employed by the town as a kind of 
military service (20 months) ... Funny !!!


Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems 
have you owned?

My father bought me an Atari 520 ST in 1988, it was my first computer.


How long have you been an Atari owner?

Since 1988 then ... 8/9 years, so much!


What do you think of the Atari scene in general??

I'm a bit angry about the whole movement! We are dying slowly, each
crew seems to be flying onto the PC.  Eko misses me so much ... I 
should say however that the guys who stay are rather cool and 
"productive" but it's different than 4 years later. France suxx!



Which demo, in your opinion, is the best you've seen on either the
Falcon or ST??

On F030, Eko System and ST ... i don't remember but it may come 
from Agression or Synergy! I love The Sowatt demo !!


What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc)

None! My ex-crew, HydroxiD, is now completly destroyed and I have
few contacts here. I prefer to chat and swap with Foreigner Guys! 
(Hi there Germany, UK, Austria, ...)


Do you have any new productions (demos, games, etc) coming 
soon ?? Please tell us about these !!

I will code a Demo with my new Crew, Reservoir Gods. As my 
motivation is low this time, I'm still not ready to start a new 
demo. I'm a bit tired ... I've coded 5 big productions on F30, 
how many coders can or have done the same, eh ?


Which computer show(s) or parties do you have fond memories of?

Above all, the Symposium'96 for the ambiance and the Fried Bits III
for the organisation. ST's parties were cool, even if I was totally 
unknown and unproductive! (Crystal Party, Sanom, Intermedia, ...)


What is your opinion of diskzines on the Atari scene??
(ie Maggie, ST News, ST Plus, Toxic, etc)

I love Maggie Disk, Dnt paper & Dba were cool, anyway!! Toxic Mag
is rather funny! Even if i hate the menu!!! C'est quand meme un bon 
mag francais.


Which is your favourite web site ?? (Give URLs if you can)

Acf's one, because you find all the interesting adress to download
or visit Demo-Scene sites. By the way, mine is -> 
http://www.imaginet.fr/~arto and my email is arto@imaginet.fr. 
Write to me soon, eh ??

(ED-note: Arto's site is a good one, check it out today !!)


What is your favourite TV show ??

I love The X-Files, Emergency (ou Urgences pour les Francais!) and
some interesting broadcastings such as Capital & Zone Interdite, 
on the french TV, of course!


And your worst TV programme ??

All the lame soap operas and the Trisomic Games (Juste Prix,
Les Z'amours, ...) I want to kill my mother each time she watches them! 
(ED-note: Hopefully this is just a joke ...)


What is your favourite movie of all time??

I just remember the French Name, "Deux Garcons, une fille, trois
possibilits" but in English ... yes ... Threesome!


What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen??

The worst movie ... Ones like Police Academy or Walt Disney's 
production, they suxx! Burn them!


Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies??

I have not favorite ones but I like Melany Griffith, Antonio
Banderas, Mathieu Kassovitch, Bruce Willis, John Travolta, 
Uma Thurman, Jack Nicholson, ...


Who or what do you find everyone else seems to like, that the media
seems to hype up, but which you personally loathe intensely ??

I hate Lova Moor (French Shit!), Smain (an old "comic"), 
Johnny Hallyday and many others!


Some words, people and places to react to ...
(please be as frank as you like)



Piracy

Killer!


Censorship

Funny!


Norm of Skarla

Arghhhh ... T'es qu'une merde et tu le sais.

(Ed-note: See Arto's article in Maggie 20 regarding this guy ..)


The recent series of strikes in France

That's life!


Jacques Chirac (president of France)  

Nothing! He suxx.


The infamous French tabloid newspapers.

Especially print for lamers and suckers!


Independence Day (the movie)

J.R.R. Tolkien

My God!


The Coreys (Feldman and Haim - Lost Boys I & II, etc)

?

(ED-note: It seems as though these guys have not yet made it in 
France yet ...)


If we were ever to visit you (ie, myself and Chris Holland), where 
would you take us for a night out??

A Techno place at Paris names Le Palace or Le Rex! Techno/Goa 
rules the World!


What is your favourite book of all time ??

I can't answer but Lord of Rings was ... But Isaac Asimov is 
great, Frank Herbert too, Mike Resnick too, ... J.R.R. Tolkien 
is a God!


Who is your favourite musical group?

I love all style of musics! Maybe U2, Astral Projection, 
Cranberries, Supremem NTM, Hallucinogen, .. a long list ...


Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet??

East 17 and their friends! It's a World Wide Joke, Corona suxx!


Who is your favourite music singer ??

Dolores from Cranberries or Bono/U2! Coolshen/NTM is good ...


Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection?

All!


Thanks for your replies, Arto - hope everything goes to plan.


Thanxx for your attention! Love your F030 and buy a Nemesis!

Au revoir!
Arto/Ex-Hydroxid - Paris/France
