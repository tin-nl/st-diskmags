DAVID ENCILL/TITAN DESIGNS INTERVIEW               BY JOHN SUMMERFIELD 
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
 
> 1) Firstly can we start with a little history of Titan Designs and 
their partnership with Black Scorpion Sotware

Titan Designs Ltd was formed in 1989 to develop the Reflex Card - a 
high resolution graphic card aimed at the Mega ST. Soon after 
releasing Reflex an interface card was produced to allow interfacing 
to standard 520/1040 STE's. Overall the Reflex Card proved to be a 
very successful development and the springboard for greater things.

During 1993, when the Atari Falcon started to make an appearance, we 
concentrated on a new development in the form of a video digitizer 
(eventually named Expose').

With high quality software needed to support Expose', we had been 
aware for some time of the wonderful developments that were coming 
from the Black Scorpion Software team. They were subsequently 
contacted to see whether a Falcon-specific program could be produced 
to support Expose', and this eventually transpired as APEX Media.

APEX Media was, without doubt, the most sensational software package 
to appear on the Falcon at this time and proved to be a resounding 
hit. Too good in fact to even consider releasing as 'support' software 
for Expose' and it wsa therefore considered necessary to release 
'Media' as a stand-alone product. Even now, some two years after being 
released, orders are still being received from all over the world.

During the APEX development it was decided to incorporate the company 
and Black Scorpion Software Ltd was formed in February 1994.

Already the future is being planned out in the form of Nemesis (the 
Falcon system accelerator), Videlity screen enhancement software, APEX 
Alpha and APEX Audio. Besides these we have several other new ideas 
and developments which promise to be every bit as good as our previous 
products.

There is no doubt that the general Atari market did start declining 
about two years ago, but we are finding that interest in Falcon 
products continues unabated. Certainly the interest shown in the APEX 
Series and Nemesis does support this and seems to suggest that the 
professional side of the market is holding its own (and probably 
increasing in strength).

I have already stated many times that the Falcon's strengths were 
mainly in the audio and graphic fields, and I see no reason to change 
that opinion. This is probably best supported by knowing that one of 
our customers, Eddie McGlone, uses a Falcon running APEX Media, right 
next to a heavy-duty Pentium running 3D Studio - a graphics software 
package costing #2,500!

>3) Because of the larger PC market is it a possibility that Titan may 
>move into that area. Emulators and the like.

Peter Armitage (the developer of Thought! Ideas Processor) is already 
converting this program to OS/2. In addition Black Scorpion have just 
finished an art program for this platform and have already developed a 
Morphing engine for Windows NT. Unfortunately the future of the OS/2 
platform is uncertain, particularly with the advent of Windows 95 - we 
would still like to see OS/2 succeed though...

While this may give the impression that we are actively seeking to 
cross over to PC development, this is most definately not the case. 
After completion of APEX Alpha/Audio, our next major software 
development will be Falcon based, although it will be aimed 
specifically at the professional musician/composer.

While we have no plans as yet to develop hardware for the PC - this 
market is already over-crowded and new developments seem to last a few 
months, rather than for years - we are considering a new Falcon 
graphic-based development.

> 4) As you know, I was at the Atari show in Birmingham, my personal 
view was that it went very well, how did you see the success of the 
show and the new companies that apperared there.

My opinion was that the Atari Shows were a resounding success. We 
experienced large attendances, a great deal of interest and it just 
proved that the Atari market is still alive and kicking. I think every 
company that attended had similar experiences.

> 5) The first issue of Atari Computing was released at the show and 
> proved to be a popular magazine. What did you think of the new mag.

Excellent as a first foray into this market, and something which was 
sorely needed following the demise of Atari World and ST Format. I 
think ACG have just about got the balance right, with something in 
there to satisfy everybody.

> 6) Almost following on from question five. The internet will play a 
role in the survival of the Atari platform, providing a place for 
Atarians to meet and locate software. Your views of the internet and 
other media, eg diskmags, will help Maggie to improve its features and 
articles.

We are tending to use the Internet more and more. It's so much easier 
for customers anywhere in the world to contact us and to receive a 
reply on the same day! I try to encourage people to consider using the 
'net' as much as possible, as it does offer so much more flexibility 
and provides up to date information and news.

Disk magazines also play a very important role in keeping the Atari 
community informed of the latest news and views and I've always looked 
forward to receiving Maggie and Atariphile.

> 7) I quite often visit the Titan web pages. They are very 
informative and very well designed. I believe Jim Morrisey had a part 
to play in its initial design. (Name dropping again). But has it 
proved a useful method of advertising.

Extremely! Our Web site has received much praise and offers us the 
opportunity to use another form of media to keep people informed of 
the latest developments. It has also helped many new overseas users to 
contact us, who are probably reluctant to use the phone. Jim was a 
great help in getting the Web site started and once the design and 
much of the code was written it was just a matter of keeping things up 
to date.

As I mentioned earlier, the Falcon in particular is an excellent tool 
for the musician and graphic artist and perhaps programmers should 
concentrate here. Although this might make it more of a niche 
platform, it does offer so much in these fields. Having said this, 
there is always a market for good utilities, but with regard to 
applications, I really don't think there is room for another word 
processor, DTP, spreadsheet, etc. due to the smaller market potential.

> 9) It would appear there are still a number of high class 
programmers on the Atari. Do you believe it is a job of companies such 
as Titan to push these programmers into creating more commercial type 
software as opposed to just demo coding.

I often wonder how much good talent is being wasted out there, purely 
because they believe there is no real incentive to produce an 
application or utility. Demo coding is fine - it demonstrates the 
power of the Atari (and the programmer) - but they have no real 
functional use.

Our doors are always open to anyone who wants to contact us with a 
good idea, either hardware or software. We also have several stunning 
ideas of our own, but don't have time to see them all reach fruition, 
so perhaps this may provide a new outlet for someone to earn money in 
their spare time.

> 10) A common question. Your views of the Atari Corp and their merger 
> with JTS.

Personally I think it was necessary for Atari to follow this course of 
action, purely for their own survival, but this probably means that 
there will never be another new Atari badged computer.

To a certain extent Atari shot themselves in the foot so many times 
they must have difficulty walking now! Firstly they were unwilling or 
unable to cut the price of the Falcon to a level that was affordable 
to the average user, and secondly by not marketing either the Falcon 
or Jaguar properly. Too often in the past they were content to take a 
back seat and let the third party developers market the computer for 
them. The problem here was that no developer had the strength to 
market such a system for the mainstream user and, consequently, the 
Falcon never got the accolades it deserved.

A great pity that Atari now see a future in producing disk drives :-\

> 11) The atari range in the last ten years has developed from the 
humble, or not so humble, ST to the Hades. How do you view these 
changes.

With great interest - the only problem is that none of the new breed 
of 040/060 clones (besides Afterburner040 which is, of course, a 
Falcon expansion board) support the DSP, which prevent the best Falcon 
graphic programs from running on them - I'm talking of APEX Media and 
Alpha of course!

I have heard that the new Centek 040/060 is downwardly compatible with 
the 56001 which may make the task of porting the APEX Series over, but 
this machine has yet to make an appearance. Still, if anyone wants to 
loan us a Hades or a Centek, we may look into porting the APEX 
Series... :-)

My only doubt is the sheer cost of the Hades, which at this price can 
only really appeal to the power user/dedicated Atarian/lottery winner, 
but I understand they are considerably cheaper on the continent.

Sheer speed is not necessarily the answer anyway - if any application 
is written properly, even the most basic machine can benefit 
enormously. Look what Doug Little of BSS has achieved in the past - 
even his very early STE and Falcon demos were stunning.

> 12) Since Compo left the Atari scene. Titan has taken over the 
> distrubution of the Gribnif products. Has this move gone well.

Reasonably well, considering that we took over the Gribnif range 
during the summer period when most peoples Atari starts gathering 
dust! The new promotion of the Geneva/NeoDesk 4 bundle at #79.95 is 
starting to attract a lot of interest and I anticipate that many users 
will be looking at this combination in the next few months. The new 
price of Arabesque Pro (#39.95) caught a few people by surprise too.

> 13) A difficult question maybe, but can we have your views on the 
> developments that are coming from other developers.

While there are some excellent programs around, virtually all are GEM-
based and, while this is fine for covering the entire Atari 680x0 
range, it doesn't take true advantage of the Falcon's power. I think 
many developers would be surprised at the level of interest a Falcon-
specific product would generate, but it's a pity there are so few top-
class developers remaining. Hopefully though we will see a few more 
companies starting to back individual developers.

On the hardware side, we are fully committed to supporting the 
Afterburner040 which proves to retain excellent compatibility with 
existing Atari software, while still being (semi-) affordable.

> 14) The PC and Mac seem, or are, dominating the computer market. Has 
> does Titan view the policies of companies such as Microsoft and their 
> power struggle.

The competition for quality PC software is fierce and it truly is a 
dog-eat-dog world out there! Many of these problems could be seen as 
excessive competition which forces companies to release programs well 
before they have been properly tested. Microsoft have now become 
market leaders in just about every field of PC applications, but they 
are becoming increasingly remote from the wishes and desires of the 
average user. This tends to manifest itself with software that tells 
the user what to do, rather than the other way round, leading to a 
certain amount of frustration and lack of flexibility.

> 15) Finally. As an exclusive to Maggie what are Titan and BSS 
planning in the next few months that will be of interest to our 
readers.

Following the release of APEX Alpha and Audio, we intend to look at 
developing a new APEX product for the professional musician/composer, 
but it is difficult for me to mention too much at this stage with this 
only being a prospect for the future.

The new hardware development, similarly, is purely an idea at the 
moment but you can be assured that whatever happens we will continue 
our policy of developing ground-breaking products!

While this may appear to be tantalising and as if we were dangling a 
carrot, we have to adopt the policy of protecting our ideas and 
investments until we consider that the time is right to make an 
official announcement of our future intentions.
