…The Ishar Trilogy Reviewed.

(Which turned into a bit of a rant at the end, I'm afraid.)

France has a  rather  dubious  reputation  with  games  as  far as I'm
concerned. No one  can  doubt  that  French  games  have  a marvellous
graphical quality, but the  trouble  is,  they  often put the graphics
first and gameplay second.

In English, we have a word  for  this- "Psygnosis". However, I'd heard
good things about the Ishar series of adventures, and as 16/32 Systems
was selling Ishar 1,2 and 3 combined  for the rather reasonable sum of
15 quid at the Brum Atari  show,  I  decided  to  buy it. So are these
games worth œ15? Yes, I suppose so, but there are grave reservations.

All three games proved themselves to  be  rather humdrum in play. Call
me hyper-critical (as most people do) but  I was not too impressed. As
far as I'm concerned,  one  of  the  best  ever  ST  games was Dungeon
Master, and I measure every  RPG  game  against this. The problem with
the Ishar games is, even  though  they  were  made years after Dungeon
Master, they have not learnt its' lessons.

Dungeon Master created a  rich  involving  enviroment,  packed full of
puzzles held together by a tight  sense  of  purpose. It was almost an
object lesson in good  game  design.  But  in  Ishar  you just tend to
wander around wondering what's going  on,  or even worse, going around
in circles killing endlessly regenerating monsters to get money to buy
a better sword.

All three games are more or less  the same- you must explore a fantasy
kingdom to overthrow an evil dictator  and return the land to harmony.
Gameplay consists of  wandering  around  mazes  disguised  as towns or
mountain trails and spasmodically clicking  on "fight" buttons to kill
some cardboard-cutout monsters. These games also feature extensive use
of the old chesnut "take object  A  to  location B and earn reward" to
pass for involving puzzles. The main differences between the games are
that Ishar 2 has a much better  user interface than Ishar 1, and Ishar
3 uses digitised graphics.

In the manual provided it is  explained  that Ishar means "Unknown" in
the Elven tongue, but I suspect  it  actually means "Disk access". You
see, in the land of Ishar the  entire  kingdom has been placed under a
curse of  constant  disk  accessing  and  swapping,  making  half  the
challenge of these games putting  up  with  all  of this. Worst of the
bunch is Ishar 3. Every time you go  into a building, you have to swap
disks and typically wait 30-40  seconds,  the  same  goes for when you
leave a building too. And  all  you  get  for  this  is a picture of a
shopkeeper and a sampled tune.

So.... a period  of  waiting  with  not  too  much  at  the  end of it
..hmmm... it seems Ishar  also  means  "World  Wide  Web" in the Elven
tongue too.... I suppose the problem  would  be reduced by running the
games off a hard disk (which you can do in all three), but on a floppy
disk, I'd say about 30% of the  time playing the game will be consumed
by disk accessing.

The other big thing that  lessens  these  games  in  my view, are that
there are lots of conceptual shortcuts  taken in the gameplay. To give
an example, monsters turn  up  at  random,  literally appearing before
you. Objects held by a slain  character  vanish into thin air when you
move from where  that  member  of  the  party  was  killed. Non-player
characters don't move about independently etc.  Also I don't think the
first-person view system works  well  in  open  areas, basically, it's
like wearing blinkers, there is no peripheral vision (you can only see
straight ahead and not out of the corner of your eye). This works well
when in a confined space like a dungeon, but on an open plain you tend
to wander about  missing  stuff  that  you  can't  see  because  it is
diagonally ahead of you.

Oh yeah, there's  also  some  bugs  too:

Ishar  1: Sometimes after an animation frame, parts of the screen that
should be restored are not, i.e. buttons do not return to  normal, and
werewolves seem to sprout two heads. Occasionally the game locks up on
a disk swap when entering Ewingyl village (rightmost town on the map).
Now  and again parts  of the view display  appear in the  wrong place, 
also there's a slight glitch in double-buffered screen display routine
caused  by  not  fully  clearing  out  the  data  register  used  when 
translating  the address  of screen  RAM into  the  hardware  register
format, which is present in all three games.

Ishar 2:  Occasionally some  slight  corruption  of  player  panels if
clicked on during fighting. One time  the  game locked up, then bombed
out during a fight with some  guards  by  the bank when a party member
was near death and I stepped back out of the way.

Ishar 3: Palette splitting  particulary  wobbly.  Very nasty bug where
mouse buttons lock up and only directional keys work, if during a disk
swap the game requests another disk  and  won't  wait for you to press
Return, this means the bug has activated. Only happens very rarely, so
save your game after doing anything  significant, and before you enter
another building.

ALL MOANS IS IT? Okay, so how  could these games be improved? I'd like
to see combat with monsters that was more like a beat'em'up instead of
sequential button clicking. We could  have characters that moved about
independently and talked to each  other.  Shops  where you can sell as
well as buy. The designers  seem  to  have  thought, "bigger game area
equals better game", not so, all this means is more tedious wandering.

What's important in games is not  the  physical  size of the game area
but the depth of interaction.  To  use  a  strange analogy, the design
philosophy behind Ishar is like trying  to increase the value of money
by making coins bigger.

RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES  There are  much  better  games than Ishar in
this genre. Try Dungeon  Master  &  Chaos  Strikes  Back or Captive or
Bloodwych. 16/32 are selling  old  and  second  hand  ST games at good
prices so have a word with them if you're interested.

AND HERE IT ALL DESCENDS INTO A  RANT....  Before I finish, the manual
for these games inspired  me  to  write  a  few thoughts about piracy,
here's what's printed at  the  back  of  the  Ishar 3 manual:

"COMPUTER PIRACY Many people have  shared in the design  and marketing
of  the software  program you are using. This development was financed
by the results of selling previous games.  Illegal copies of  software
programs lead to a fall in profits, thus making  prices  rise, harming
the  consumer and  directly threatening  the world of  video games and 
their  uses (sic). Apart from the fraudulent  sale of  copies which is 
very severly punished by law, there is a moral aspect to bare (sic) in
mind - piracy swells the dole queues!"

After playing these games, the impression I  was left with was that if
I had paid full price for these i.e. 3x œ25= 75 quid, I would be happy
to see the entire staff of  Simarils  queuing  up  in a very long dole
queue indeed. In fact I'd  be  feeling  like  learning to speak French
(with particular emphasis on  swearing)  and  flying  over the channel
just to tell these clowns just what I thought of them.

The "piracy makes prices rise"  argument  is  total rubbish - when did
you last see an announcement to the effect that one software house was
putting its' prices up? Videogame  prices rise purely because software
houses all get together and hike the  price up every time a new system
comes out. I remember reading in  ST  Format  a  few years ago a quote
from a bloke from  Psygnosis,  saying  that  there  must  be a massive
piracy ring on the ST as there was  a healthy sale of ST magazines but
a low sale of ST games.

What he completely overlooked was that:

a) Most games are not that much  cop due to  most videogame  companies
obsession  with  graphics and licences  instead  of  gameplay.

b)  Standardised  pricing cuts  sales  because there's no relationship
between quality and price,like there is with almost all other consumer
goods.

c) There is a hell of a lot more you can do with a computer than  just
play  games.  I,  for instance, never  bought too  many  games  purely 
because  I'm  more interested in programming.

Rather than squealing about software piracy, which by its' very nature
cannot be quantified, software houses should be more concered with the
many millions of people who find videogames  to be of such low quality
and poor value for money as to  not  bother with them, _this_ is where
all the lost revenue is-  the  massive  untapped  market of people who
want affordable playable games, not the  type of consumer the industry
is currently obsessed with- the daft  schoolboy  who  sees a game as a
fashion item to show off to his mates.
