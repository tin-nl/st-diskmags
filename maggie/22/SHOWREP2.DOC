THE UK ATARI SHOWS 96 - BIRMINGHAM AND LONDON

On the weekend of the 28th and 29th September 1996, two Atari 
shows, that had been organised by Goodmans PDL, went ahead.  
There had been a lot of planning beforehand for these particular 
shows - and as the Maggie Team, we were approaching them as 
exhibitors rather than ordinary punters, which was certainly a 
change, to say the least !!

An early morning start was necessary for myself, Chris and Dave 
Hollis; we finally managed to leave Chris's place just after 7.30 
am to make the trip to the Birmingham show.  As well as 
ourselves, we also had 2 Falcons (mine and Chris's) 2 monitors, a 
big hired television, as well as Dave's ST setup.  Unfortunately 
there wasn't enough space for Dave to use his setup at the show, 
so we just used our Falcons, monitors and the television.  A lot 
of this gear was certainly heavy, the TV required 2 people alone 
to actually lift the damn thing !!  Thankfully, it did a great 
job at displaying the demos we showed off at both shows, as well 
as issue 21 of Maggie, which had just been released during the 
weekend.

After a drive of around an hour and a half we reached the 
National Motorcycle Museum, where we got parked easily and 
started to unload our gear and set up our stand.  On arrival at 
the show, we met Roy Goring and Chris Good, who, together with 
Alistair Goold and Antony Lacey (we hadn't met these two before) 
were doing the job of manning the Atari User Groups stand.  Chris 
Good had been working on a 'Virtual Web' site, which many 
visitors to the show used to look through and view the latest 
pages from WAG, STAG and other organizations whose pages were 
present on the site.

Next to our stand was a new company called Sunrise Audio Systems.  
They had set up a fully-fledged recording studio to demonstrate 
to visitors, which was pretty interesting to see.  Opposite them 
(next to us) was the Console Centre, which was selling Jaguars 
and related games at moderate to good prices.

Around the rest of the show, there were admittedly the usual 
Atari names that we've come to know and love.  Merlin had a stand 
there and were pushing their new Internet server, which looked 
good, also System Solutions were there, with probably either the 
first or the second most expensive stand (sharing this accolade 
with Sunrise Audio !!).  Next to Sys Sols were the Atari 
Portfolio Club (headed by Paul Finch).  Alongside Paul were 
16/32, selling off a wide range of Atari software, including some 
new titles for the Jag (some of which hadn't been seen before!!).
Across from the main customer entrance were Goodman PDL, with 
Mike keeping the famous 'eagle-eye' over the main door.  Next to 
them was someone selling rather amusing car stickers such as "PC 
Free Zone - together with the Atari Fuji logo).  The new printed
magazine - Atari Computing - was also represented at a stand by 
Mike Kerslake, Joe Connor and other odd people from time to time.
The Upgrade Shop (TUS) was the last stand around the sides of the 
room.

In the middle of the room, however, were four more stands, these 
belonged to Floppyshop (hi Steve !!), Best Electronics (Hi Brad 
!!)  As per usual, Brad was selling his selection of Atari 
related spares and odds and ends, but was also looking a lot 
better than last time, when, he only arrived at Heathrow airport 
with 2 hours to spare before the first show.  The other two 
stands were selling odds and ends from the Atari scene, like used 
blank disks.

Back to the Maggie Team stand, which was probably one of the 
noisiest at the shows.  Both Chris and myself did a fair bit of 
explaining about Maggie to interested punters; this job was taken 
over very handily by Ed Cleveland and Mike Noyce at times, to 
give us a break.  We were also joined by the usual crowd, as well 
as consisting of Ed and Mike, Kev Davies, Kev Dempsey, Leon, Tash 
and Steve Tattersall (Tat), all of whom bought copies of Atari 
Computing, which they seemed pretty pleased with.

I was also doing my fair share of showing off various demos on 
the TV that had been hired for the event.  Many punters were 
amazed at the quality of most of the demos that were shown, but 
the biggest crowds gathered at one stage to 'Ooh' and 'Aah' when 
Lazer's demo, Lost Blubb, was shown.  This, together with 
Obnoxious and Bugs From Outer Space were shown at regular 
intervals.

During my breaks from our stand, I met up with a lot of people, 
some of whom I knew and most who I hadn't met before.  This was 
not the case with Frank Charlton, Neil Rodway-Jones or Joe 
Connor, but it certainly was the case when I met up with Daron 
Brewood !!  I also got the chance to meet Nick Flintham (Flinny) 
at last ... as I've often spoken to him over the IRC but had not 
met him before then.  I also met up again with Graeme Rutt and 
the guys from System Solutions, who were very pleased to see us 
and the fact that we had a stand at last.  Both Phineas Pope and 
his mother (from Merlin) were pleased to see us, but I gather 
that things didn't go too well as far as the selling of software 
had gone.  One thing I do know is that Chris ended up buying 
their big cardboard box of spare blank ex-Atari pack disks.

At the 16/32 stand, I purchased the long-awaited copy of Defender 
2000, the new game by Jeff Minter.  Unfortunately, as neither the 
Nemesis board or Apex 3 weren't yet available, these were not 
purchased as had been hoped.  Hopefully we'll get these soon.

Titan Designs were there with a stand, however, there were 2 
Falcons with Nemesis installed, both running beta versions of 
Apex 3.  This looked really good .... but might have been helped 
a bit more if Mr Forgetful hadn't visited Dave Encill the night 
before .... because for some reason the battery for the camcorder 
which they tend to have on display to show off Apex did not come 
with them !!

Mr Forgetful was certainly busy the night before the Birmingham 
show as well, however !!  As well as visiting Titan, he also 
visited Mike Goodman, meaning that he left an important box full 
of PD at home, containing some of that which I'd copied for him 
the week previously !!  Never mind.

Generally, the Birmingham show was felt to be a success, even 
Mike Goodman was reported to have said this on a visit to the 
toilet !!  Many of the questionnaires that were available were 
filled out and returned to Goodmans, from what we heard here many 
people were asking for another show to be organised for next 
April.  At the time of writing, this hasn't yet been announced, 
but hopefully it will go ahead.

On the Sunday, with CiH in the driving seat, we made our way down 
to the London show.  Unfortunately for one reason or another Dave 
had decided not to come with us; he kicked himself after this as 
someone who most wanted to meet him turned up all the way from 
Kings Lynn !!  However, the show was very busy agai.

The London show took a little while to get going ... this is 
apparently usual as people need to get there on the underground 
etc.  Due to Osterley being pretty far out of London, this meant 
that it took visitors a little more time than usual.

The Osterley Hotel was a superb place to hold the Atari Show.  
Very spacious with ample room for everyone to get in comfortably 
with their stands, this was probably the best location so far for 
a London-based Atari show.  Most of the people with stands from 
Birmingham were at London, with the exception of the ST Club.  
However, it was also here at London that Col Fisher-McAllum and 
Kev Beardsworth had their stand.  They spent the entire day 
explaining to visitors about AtariPhile disk mag, and showing off 
42BBS.  According to both Col and Kev there was a lot of interest 
here, with many people buying modems from System Solutions after 
speaking to them, so I guess they must have been pleased !!

We were situated on the stage, sharing this with Roy Goring and 
the Atari User Groups stand once again.  Again, Maggie proved to 
be very popular indeed with a lot of visitors, most of whom 
bought copies from Mike Goodman later on during their walkaround.
Here, as in Birmingham, people gathered to watch the various 
demos that were being shown on my Falcon; they enjoyed the 
'Obnoxious' demo, which was admittedly screened a few times.  
They also enjoyed watching Lost Blubb and Autowaschen Verboten 
from Lazer; the new entries from the recent Nordic Atari Show 96
proved also to be a hit, with several people enquiring about the
Bugs From Outer Space demo that was shown a few times.  Our stand 
was also conceded to be the noisiest stand there after reading 
recent posts to the Atari newsgroups on the Internet !! Not too 
noisy, I hasten to add, after the initial sound check in the 
morning (when Karl came over to see us, wondering what all the 
noise was) everything was OK first time, which was nice.

Matt Smith and his mate from Mad PD also came with his Falcon, 
and proceeded to show off some new animations to the interested 
crowds.  This, again, was very popular, talking with Matt later 
on in the bar made me realise just how committed Matt and his 
mate actually were to the Atari scene, despite them both owning 
PCs (I think).  Matt had also brought his CD-ROM drive along, so 
we were able to grab some useful stuff off there.

All in all, the London show seemed to be more busier than the 
Birmingham one; this may have been due to an influx of people at 
around 11.00 am or so.  Nevertheless, both shows went very well, 
and it is hoped that Goodmans will organise some more soon.

Felice.
