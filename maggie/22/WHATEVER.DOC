A look back over the last year's hot new games news.. Which of these 
made it, which have been buried for good, and hopefully, those games 
which are still in the pipeline even now..

(Refer back to Maggie issues 19, 20 and 21 for original data from 
the 'previews' section..)

Top Byte.. (ST)

Not a brilliant year for them, We did get Stario's Xmas, and a 3-D 
arcade game Kryptonite Data.. Of the other games, not a lot is known, 
although James was advertising the role player game Aronath in the 
dying issues of ST Format.. The present status of Top Byte is very 
uncertain at this time, with suggestions of problems between the 
proprieter and people owed money.. Any new information or attempts to 
set the record straight would be greatly appreciated..          

Merlin.. (Falcon)

We were anticipating two new versions of 'Obsession' for the Falcon, as 
they had taken over the rights from UDS to produce this for the '030.. 
An extremely casual approach from the Swedish end of things meant that 
vital data disks were extremely slow in forthcoming, or not at all, 
which put this project on indefinite hold..

During 1996, we are alerted to an interesting release from 21st Century 
Entertainment for the PC entitled 'Absolute Pinball' the screenshots 
were *very* reminiscent of the original STe version of Obsession.. No 
prizes for guessing what UDS are doing now!

Bad Mood.. (Falcon)

A Doom WAD player for the Falcon, eventually to be expanded to a full 
game.. Better versions are still making their way out, but no signs of 
the addition of the bad guys at time of writing.. Although one 
(unsubstantiated) report suggests things might have got a little bit 
further now.. Other add-ons, such as a GEM shell to overcome the rather 
basic .TTP command line interface have also been developed 
independently..

Doug Little's involvement has slowed in the latter part of 1996, as he 
is hard at work on various Titan/Black Scorpion projects, especially 
the new Apex Alpha.

Reservoir Gods.. (Falcon)

A beacon of consistency in a sea of broken promises.. A quieter year 
for them after the triumphs of 1995, but we still got Skyfall, probably 
the ultimate 'Columns' game anywhere, and Mr Pink is hard at work on 
his latest epic, 'Spy Hunt', an overhead view arcade game which should 
be ready for the end of the year..

The ST-based 3-D racing game from the two non-Falcon members is still 
on hold as no suitable distributor can be found.. The Falcon Owners 
group CD-ROM front end collapsed with the end of that organisation.. 
However, there is the possibility of further collaboration with certain 
people for demo-based productions as well..

Village Software.. (ST)

Released Bio-Hazard II for the ST, but main man, Rich Davey came off 
the Falcon altogether shortly thereafter..

There is no sign of other Village Software releases such as Outrider or 
Warcry, or the adventure game Dark Ritual.. Nor is there likely to be..

Symposium previews.. (Falcon)

Quite a few new games were shown at the Hamburg event last April.. The 
most promising of these in all departments was 'Running', the Doom-
clone for the Falcon, which featured a complete level, with full 
collision detection, with bad guys, and with the means to do them in.. 
Virtually a complete game engine there, all that was needed was a 
little tidying up, and a bit of level design by Stax Developments.. The 
timescale that was suggested back then was about six months to complete 
the game.. Allowing for slippage, we should hopefully still see this 
one in late '96 or early '97.. The other potentially complicating 
factor is that this game will probably have some sort of commercial 
distribution, which always seems to delay things massively, at least 
over here in the UK..

Two other previews included the arcade blasters, X-Moon,and Painium 
Disaster.. The former of these being produced by various parts of the 
German demo scene, the latter by a French group Cruor.. X-Moon is the 
more uncertain of the two, depending on a massive amount of internal 
co-operation between different groups, especially when certain people 
within certain groups might not be talking to each other any more!?!? 
Most demo scene orientated productions tend to keep very much to their 
own timescale as well, which is usually much longer than most other 
people's timescales!

Stosser Soft.. (ST)

Tony Greenwood is another of life's more reliable people, as he managed 
to produce two new games this year, with a promise of a third to come 
shortly.. The first half of 1996 saw Island Strike, a fairly basic but 
well executed overhead helicopter based arcade game.. The Atari Shows 
in September saw the release of Heartland, a huge platform game 
reviewed elsewhere this issue.. A third game, believed to be an arcade 
adventure is forthcoming shortly..  Tony's games have the advantage of 
working on any ST or Falcon from 1 meg upwards..

New Beat Developments.. (Falcon)

We all cheered when we caught sight of the first preview of 'Willy the 
Adventurer', the first serious attempt to do a 'Rayman' on the Falcon.. 
Loads of coding and good presentation, if a little bit short on the 
game itself.. According to latest news, this has not gone away, and has 
had quite a bit more added to it.. One possibility is a version 
enhanced for the forthcoming Nemesis Falcon accelerator..

Digi Tallis.. (ST) 

News and a preview of another Doom clone, this one was intended to work 
on the STFM, putting one over SubStation, which needed an STe at 
least.. Jon Lewis is/was doing this one, but after the initial press 
release, it has gone quiet here.. At the same time, his previous game, 
Sub Aqua, took a while to emerge.. Any new news here??

(Very latest reports suggest that Digi Tallis is still alive and at 
work on several other projects.. There is still movement on this game, 
but things are going very slowly..)

Croft Soft.. (ST)

The people behind the Atari Times HTML diskmag.. Their game 'Mole 
Mayhem' seems to be on course for release shortly..

Well folks, that's your lot for now.. Any new developments on any of 
these titles will be reported here as soon as it happens, or we are 
told, which isn't necessarily at the same time!!
