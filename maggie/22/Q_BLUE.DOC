                          A game for Falcon 030 
                       programmed by Markus Binder
 
    The text file with this game is minimal indeed.  And the few scanty 
English words inform us that this is more of  a  'joke than a game'.  
Intrigued, we boot Q-Blue and wait for the joke to begin..

    ..oops we're in the wrong resolution, (perhaps  that was the joke) 
(this is another Gem game special) so after putting  it  into 320x240 
true colour mode we make a second attempt at having some fun.

    Sporting the correct resolution,  we  waltz  into  the  intro..  A 
somewhat chunky rendered intro picture of  a  tank  -  seen  from  an  
overhead view - is followed by a credits  screen,  using  the  system  
font  (or  its twin brother) against a nice, wibbly,  coppery  brown  
background  texture.   This  in turn is followed by the only  
configurable  option,  as  you  are  asked  to choose your vehicle 
speed from the choice of:  fast,  quick  and swift (er.. aren't they 
all the same?  -Ed)..  translated  this  should  read:  quite  
playable,  completely unplayable and totallyutterlycompletely  
unplayable.   But  more  of that later. Also on this screen is the  
'Redrobotspeed',  which  is proportional to your own speed, so if  you  
increase  your  speed,  the  robot  speed  will automatically increase 
and the game will not actually be made any easier.  In fact, increasing 
your speed makes it harder for you, but again more of that later.

    Once you have chosen your tank speed,  a  little rendered picture 
of a tank with the usual "Get Ready" sort  of  spiel  is displayed.  It 
has christened you 'Buddyboy', so after a quick trip  to  the  nearest 
phonebox to change into your cheesy suit, slick back your short hair  
with appreciable amounts of spittle and affix your black rimmed 
glasses,  you  press  space  and  almost enter the game. Almost.. but 
the coder could  not  resist  prolonging  the suspense, a enigmatic 
sentence (perhaps part  of  the  joke?)  is  displayed:  'Do  you  know 
what old fashioned meanes?' (sic).  Hmm, at this point we feel that are 
being tentatively primed NOT to expect too much, not to take too much 
seriously.  We cease to even expect that a game will emerge  out  of  
this labyrinth of introduction screens. And we certainly wonder if it 
will be worth all the effort expended to reach it. But with our last 
spark of patience we  strike the much abused space bar and the gaming 
field emerges..

    ..but still one more delay  is  yet  to  be  endured!  as yet 
another small picture of a rendered tank appears, this  time  with a 
brief explanation of what you must do to complete this level  -   
collect all the 'blue radioactive balls' to escape from earth.  
Dismissing this last delay with a snarl of impatience, we are into the 
game.

    The gaming field is mostly green, on  some parts are speckled green 
squares which look like someone has scattered about eight light green 
pixels on a  green block.  Some of these animate very occasionally  and 
these are the swamp squares and must be avoided because if  you  drive  
onto  them you will be informed that your tank is not an 'amphi-car' 
and  a  life  will be lost.  The trouble is that the swamp squares look 
very similar to normal  squares and so it is difficult to tell what is 
swamp and what is not and this can be frustrating.

    The blue balls are distributed around the level, usually placed in 
areas of heavy swamp and you must drive your little  tank around the 
level to reach them. Also clumped in clusters around  the  levels  are  
crates  which you can push in front of your tank, these are used  in  
later levels to push onto special blocks and convert them into blue 
balls which  can  then  be picked up.  There are also yellow balls 
which have something to do with power fuel, but they didn't seem to do 
much.  Just collect 'em anyway.

    On the first level there is a little spinning, rendered earth in 
the centre of the level, a nice  little  touch.   And  as  the levels 
progress, the puzzles change, (some of them have a distinct  Chip's  
Challenges feel) on one, you must drive the correct way around a  
'maze'  -  in  the  loosest  sense of the word - because the ground you 
drive over turns to  swamp.   But it is such a token maze that it is  
perhaps a little too easy.

    The redrobots emerge after a few levels,  taking the form of square 
blocks. They sort of home in on you and try to 'restrict your 
mobility', but are so slow and easy to  outwit  that  they  might  as  
well  be  wearing  Blackburn shirts. However, I have not seen them when 
they are faster (i.e. when you have increased your own speed and thus 
increased theirs)  so  they may well turn into Sheffield Wednesday 
Gods.. who knows.

    I have not seen speedy  robots  because  when  you  increase your 
own speed (even only to 'quick') your tank moves  SO  quickly that it 
is almost impossible to control accurately (especially because  the  
controls  are joystick only) and invariably you end up blundering into 
a swamp and/or knocking that crucial crate against a wall and getting 
it stuck.  It's a good idea to have options in a game so that players 
can configure  the  game  to  suit  their own wishes, but having 
options  that  render  (ha-bloody-ha  -Ed)  a  game  unplayable  seem  
a  little pointless.  If the options  had  increased  your  speed  by a 
reasonable amount, they would have been a nice addition, but as  it is, 
they might as well not have bothered; catering for suicidal gamers 
should not really be a priority.

    Well, for a joke game, there  is  more  to  this than Markus 
Binder's other game 'Solitar De Luxe'.  It may  be  a little lacking 
graphically, (although the rendered pictures  look  nice,  the  rest  
of  the  graphics  are  distinctly 16 colourish) but the gameplay  is  
definitely  trying  to  struggle  out  of a Gem straight-jacket and 
shout "I'm Sane!".  For the  puzzle addict, Q-Blue is a true blue find, 
something of a Gem..?
