„Is it STill crap??… 
(Yep!)

Quite a few years ago, something came along that was a unique one-off, 
never to be repeated diskmag sensation.. That became known as Maggie, 
and its story is very well known in here.. A bit earlier on, there was 
something else that turned up, something *not quite* as good, one of my 
earliest experiences with the wacky world of diskmags, and that is the 
subject of this article..

STampede first came to my notice at an Atari show, I think, the '89 
Spring Computer Shopper Show at Alexandra Palace.. It was really the 
sort of purchase that came about as a result of that last twenty quid 
or so with nothing to do, and burning a hole in my pocket.. They were 
giving away free games with a subscription, so I ended up with Hard 
Drivin' and a subscription for twelve issues of this mag..

As a diskmag, it failed to hit the spot.. None of the writing was 
brilliant or inspired, and it concentrated on promotion and advertising 
rather than good reviewing practice.. In its favour, it did come with 
several game demos, some of these playable, and often a free game on 
the disk as well.. Later issues also got a "demo" style intro as well.. 
Who can forget the famous 'shattering disk' effect right at the start 
that turned up about issue four..  I certainly can! 

It was quite a colourful production, one of the first attempts at a 
non-GEM based custom shell, and I suppose a faint whiff of praise to go 
their way is due for that small achievement.. Again, there were several 
variations on the basic theme as time wore on..

They were commercial, even got as far as appearing in the newsagents in 
a fancy binder thing, and spawned a parallel Amiga version.. However, 
things did not go at all well, and this illuminating extract from 
Maggie issue 4 fills us in at this point..

              OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
             O                                           O
             O  DEAD NONENTITIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       O
             O                                           O

  Well, there's STAMPEDE Disk magazine for starters...

A sad loss,  we don't think!!!  Simply put, Stampede overestimated 
the  number  of  copies  being sold,  and ran out  of  money,  the 
Official  Receiver being called in,  as the November issue hit the 
streets..  In  fact Jengrove Enterprises were formally wound-up on 
the  8th  November 1990,  their accountants Grant  Thornton  being 
appointed  to deal with things from there under the provisions  of 
the Insolvency Act (1986) (Phew! heavy stuff..)

At this point I feel I have to disclose a terrible secret...

************Chris's Terrible Secret!!!!!!!!!*******************

I HAD A SUBSCRIPTION TO STAMPEDE!!!!!!!!!

Well  I  thought it wouldn't do any harm at the time,  a bit  of  a 
laugh and that,  and with my mates going on at me,  I just gave in 
(sob sob...) It was at the Shopper Show '89, and I only paid about 
twenty  quid  or so anyway,  and got a free game as well....  They 
wound  up with only one issue on the current year to go,  and  in 
spite  of all thats been said about them,  they have at least kept 
me in 'blank' disks....

I  had to tell you this,  otherwise you would have been  wondering 
where I got my detailed info, giving names and dates from...

The official reason for Stampedes demise was given as  circulation 
being  too low  to cover costs,  we would also suggest  (AND  have 
indeed said so in earlier Maggies..) that the general quality  and 
interest  was lacking a bit,  the quality of writing was none  too 
brilliant, and it seemed to lack 'something'...

N.B.  'Something'  that  indefinable quality that  makes  anything 
stand out from the crowd, be it a publication, or game...

I  am  sorry  to say,  but reading it left you with  the  feeling, 
'where's  the  rest of it?..' Apparently things were  not  well  at 
Jengrove  for some time,  as their writers were late in being paid 
(Or not being paid at all!) One writer considering himself "Lucky" 
he lost a few hundred pounds, this is pretty serious, in our view, 
if you are undertaking a career in computer journalism, and expect 
to eat on the basis of said career! Our sympathies go out to these 
people,  at least on Maggie,  you KNOW from the start that you are 
working for fame, if not fortune!

„(I can't let myself write like that now, these days I've got to put a 
calm, sort of authoritative 'Man in charge' style on these pages.. I 
often miss the days when I could use as many exclamation marks in an 
article as the text displayer could cope with.. (Wistful sigh..)
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
-- End of old style Maggie thing -- 

I was pretty lucky with this, having received eleven of my twelve 
issues, which meant in practice, a commercial game and twenty to thirty 
'blank' disks extra.. I was invited to the creditors meeting, but I was 
not really that tempted to travel up to Leeds to claim back my missing 
œ1.50 worth somehow..

By that time, I was becoming a hardened Maggie veteran and STampede 
faded out of my life as quickly as I could get the sticky labels to 
peel off (never an easy job, those Atari BASIC language disks I got at 
Birmingham are tenacious little buggers!)

-- If you must point the finger anywhere, blame Martin Wilson!! -- 

Now I'd forgotten all about STampede until two things made me 
concentrate more closely on what had been.. Firstly, my recent update 
of the ex-ST News Diskmag Encyclopaedia made me want to enhance the 
entry for STampede, a publication that Richard Karsmakers did not have 
first hand experience of, whereas I did.. Secondly, Martin Wilson, the 
ST+ Falcon guru told me that he had a few issues in his collection!! 
Fascinated, I asked to see them again, so here we are..

(Retrospective Review)

The issue I got from Marty was the specimen issue two, which came on 
three disks, one of which was a copy-protected game, and absent from 
this assessment.. The file and directory structure was very open and 
visible, no attempt at link-filing, and certainly no attempt at 
compression, as the text and picture files could be viewed without the 
menu program.. The normal mode of operation would have been autoboot 
from a standard ST, and it was to 'Backward' on the Falcon, that we 
turned to at this point..
  
It performed flawlessly, loading in the main options menu which 
consisted of about five 'disk' icons on a black background.. Clicking 
on one of these took you to a sub-menu, there was a 'gateway' or exit 
icon to let you get out of the sub-menu, or ultimately the menu shell 
itself..  A fancy sprite mouse cursor is your sole means of 
communicating with the magazine.. 

As it is a magazine, you first look for some text-based action, and are 
immediately disappointed with the sparseness of what is available.. An 
'editorial' that tells you little, a 'news' piece which is equally 
bland, and a competition.. The  writing, both in this issue, and 
subesquent ones is very reminiscent of the Channel Four 'Digitiser' 
teletext pages in style and article length, but thankfully lacking the 
useless and irritating pre-pubescent 'humour' of the Man with the Chin 
etc.. This issue is notable for a scarcity of text which is frankly 
astounding.. Later issues did have more in the way of text, but you 
still got this same featureless chewing of woodpulp to no good effect 
as an end result.. 

There were some abbreviated 'reviews' which were not regular texts, but 
based around a title picture or screengrab of the game with the 
'review' being scrolled underneath in a pseudo-border text scroller.. A 
bit like the demo screens of the time, but without the technical skill 
to make it *really* go in the bottom border.. Picking the textfiles out 
of the disk, these are very short and uninspiring, even more so than 
the couple of regular texts on the disk.. The text displayer itself is 
a very basic affair, with 'up' and 'down' represented, and that is it. 
No fancy font, page move options, any bells or whistles whatsover, as 
the lines of text judder uncertainly down the screen..

Next up is the 'pictures' icon, which is a slideshow of several title 
screens and screengrabs of current games, with the odd crudely painted 
advertisement for a boxshifter to display his wares.. Ho hum..

The first interesting bit is the 'demos' icon, which translates to a 
loading system for three or four commercial games demos.. Interphase, 
the rather good 3-D Cyberspace simulator by Image Works loads in, and 
we are slickly taken through a run-only demo of the first level.. All 
this on the Falcon as well, even if the sound is a bit crackly.. The 
other two game demos I tried simply reset my Falcon.. Should still be 
okay on any ST though..

The final icon is a question mark, leading you to click on it to reveal 
its mystery.. It is probably the giveaway game, as it asks for the 
missing disk 'C', and sits in a permanent sulk until you tell it to go 
away..

And that is it!! 

Issue two, not impressive at all, and worth reading again to remind 
ourselves how bad things once were.. Later issues did have more to 
them, but people only collected these for the free software that was on 
offer, not for anything the writers did within the pages of STampede.. 

STampede could have worked, but for the fact that they were sold 
commercially and bound tightly to commercial interests.. Probably not a 
coincidence that there were no really critical reviews, and a constant 
supply of free games and demo versions.. STampede could have optimised 
the magazine more and wasted less disk space, written more text, and 
punched up the writing style to produce the odd, dare I say, 
objectively critical review of some of the software they received??

STampede fell into the UK software industry trap, which was to sharply 
underestimate their readers intelligence, and to rely on surface gloss 
and wall-to-wall hype to cover over any real deficiencies.. STampede 
simply just did not cut it, caught between the conventional mainstream 
magazines, which demanded at least a decent minimum standard of 
journalistic effort, and the independent diskmags like ST News and 
Maggie which had a lot more to offer from the amateurs point of view..

They are remembered, but remembered as being bloody awful..
