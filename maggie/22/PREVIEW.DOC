What is what, and where is it all at, at the moment?? All hopeful 
speculation and overlapping confusion with things said in Leon's 'Scene 
News' to follow in here right now!

ÅReservoir Gods..

Work continues apace on their forthcoming arcade game 'Spy Hunt'.. From 
the very early preview witnessed on the Maggie stand at the Birmingham 
Autumn Atari Show, most of the main game code has been completed (as of 
late November) and that the design of eight of the thirty-two levels 
had been done.. As always, more graphics are needed as this is probably 
the most graphically intense game they've done since since Double 
Bobble..

ÅTony Greenwood and Stosser Soft..

His new game is understood now to be a follow-up to 'Heartland' and 
will feature more interactivity than that game did.. Other characters 
are to be included in the game as well. This one has a pretty good 
chance of appearing before this issue of Maggie goes to press.. If so, 
we'll tell you all about it.. (Update note:- The final result can be 
seen as a review elsewhere, and is called 'Diamond Ice'.. The latest 
speculation about Tony Greenwood and Stosser Soft suggests a return to 
the Monkey Island style game discussed previously..)

ÅEddy's Cat..

One of our regular columnists has revealed an unexpected creative 
programming side to him.. Ed Cleveland showed us another of those 
briefly glimpsed early previews at the Birmingham Atari Show in 
September, this time of an arcade adventure for the STe and upwards 
based on a combination of influences from 'Monkey Island' and the PC 
release 'Day of the Tentacle', the graphical style owing a lot to this 
latter game.. There will be several references to 'scene' people and 
many comoputing related jokes in there..  More detailed news on this 
one to follow shortly as soon as an 'official' preview version does in 
December.. (See screengrab in here too)

DONKEY  ISLAND  INFORMATION  

Donkey Island  is a graphical adventure game similar in  style  to the 
L**asa*ts series  of  point'n'click epics.  It runs on STFM,  STE  and 
Falcon and very probably TT too, though I'm unable to check this. STFM
owners get worse quality sampled  sound effects and  a  slightly  more 
garish palette, but apart from that the game runs identically  on  all
computers. 

The game runs quite happily off a hard  drive  and  takes  account  of
the amount of memory in the computer to reduce disk accessing. However
you need at least 1meg of memory to run it.  

In  the  game  you play  an ST user who has just spent 3 years playing 
the  classic adventure game "Dog Island"  and has finally finished it. 
You  remember  seeing  adverts  for the  even bigger and better sequel 
called "Donkey  Island" a while back, but for some reason it was never
released for  the  ST.  The  object  of the game is to  find  out  why  
"Donkey  Island"  was  never  released, and if possible, get hold of a
copy  of  it.  

The  user interface is totally keyboard based, as mouse control can be
irritating in this style of game  (for example, in  M**key Isl**d  you  
have to click on a door and then wait for your character to walk up to
it and then click again to open it, whereas in Donkey Island you  just
walk  up to the door and through it),  but all  keys used  to  control 
the  game  are constantly  on  screen,  so you never have to look in a 
manual to find what key does what.

Donkey Island features:
*  High  quality cartoon-style graphics and  animation,   Sampled sound 
effects,  Lots  to see  and do,  Really  annoying  but  always  logical 
puzzles,  Non-annoying   "press  the  keys"  user interface,  Sarcastic 
humour throughout,  No huge  box  that  takes up space on your shelves, 
Lots of obscure/not so  obscure  Atari scene references dotted about to
spot ....and it's 100%  Falcon unenhanced!

Release date is set for the end of February 1997.

This in, from another of our regular columnists, Kev 'Taff' Davies..

...and in other news....

My insane ambition to write a game  is coming together slowly, and yes
I know I have had countless  failures,  however  this one could be it.
"Ross Well" (ok, bad alien pun) stars Ross the Gray desperately trying
to get back to  his  space  craft  after  it  has  been  stolen by the
Goverment and shipped off to Area 51.  This game is in fact a platform
- puzzle -shoot 'em up. I will send you screen shots as it progresses.
Expect the first batch very soon (I recently modified the code and had
basic sprites moving around the level at Sonic-type speeds however the
final game will not be this  fast).  It  will work on all formats from
'fm to Falcon.

Okay, that's all for now, any other 'new' news will no doubt be 
found elsewhere in this issue..
