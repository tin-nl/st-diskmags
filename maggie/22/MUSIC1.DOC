                    LATEST MUSIC NEWS AND REVIEWS

The last couple of months or so since the release of Maggie 21 
has been a little quiet, but with the release of some new albums 
by established groups that have been seen previously in Maggie, 
this has kept this period fairly buoyant.

New albums have come from bands as diverse as the Crash Test 
Dummies and R.E.M, in the form of 'A Worm's Life' and 'New 
Adventures In Hi-Fi'.  Unfortunately, however, the British music 
scene appears to be dominated by a zero-talent 'band' called 
Spice Girls.  I guess the less said about them, the better ...
However, the more popular end of the Britpop era has been 
successful, with groups like Dodgy and Ocean Colour Scene getting 
new single entries.  Deep Blue Something, who are an American 
band of whom nobody had heard much of before got a hit with their 
superb song called 'Breakfast At Tiffanys' - a tribute to the 
famous movie of the same name.

R.E.M. - NEW ADVENTURES IN HI-FI

Ever since the release of 'Monster' back in 1994, everyone had 
been awaiting R.E.M's new album, due to rumours surfacing about 
it as early as February of 1996.  This was despite the fact that 
the album wasn't actually released until early September '96 !!
'New Adventures' is certainly pretty good, just as heavy as 
'Monster' in some tracks.  Catchy tunes also make an appearance 
here with a track called 'Wake-Up Bomb' - which had me humming it 
after first hearing it at my local pub.  Any fan of R.E.M should 
enjoy this, even if you haven't heard any singles since 'Shiny 
Happy People' back in 1991.  Certainly it is a worthwhile 
addition to anyone's music collection.


CRASH TEST DUMMIES - A WORM'S LIFE

Yes, one of Canada's best bands are back with a new album.  For 
some time now we had been receiving (via the Dummies' website) 
details of what was going to be on it - well, here it now is.
In general, the album takes a few plays to listen to it properly, 
as it is a bit heavier than 'God Shuffled His Feet' and 'The 
Ghosts that Haunt Me'.  However, there are some nice songs on the 
new album, such as 'OverAchievers' and 'He Liked To Feel It'.  
Incidentally, the video, which features a young boy wiggling his 
tooth has been somewhat censored for play on MTV, whilst only 
getting a full showing at night.  As yet it has not been seen on 
MTV here in England.  What got me was that the new album was 
released with absolutely NO fanfare or promotion whatsoever in 
England .... despite the fact that their last two albums sold by 
the bucketload back in 1994.  Still, 'A Worm's Life' is an ideal 
follow-up to the earlier albums ... and it is great to hear Brad 
Robert's famous deep voice again !!

'WEIRD AL' YANKOVIC - BAD HAIR DAY

America's number one parody artist, 'Weird Al' Yankovic, is back 
on the imports chart at Tower Records with this new album.  Bad 
Hair Day starts off with an hilarious parody of that famous hit, 
'Gangsta's Paradise' by Coolio.  Al's version is called 'Amish 
Paradise' and is largely about the Amish community who are based 
over in Philadelphia, in the US.  Other songs parodied on the 
album include U2's recent chart-topper, the song from the 
Presidents of the United States rock group and others.  The 
promised parody of Pulp's 'Common People' was missing though .. 
this is expected to be on the next album.  There is a fair crop 
of Al's original work on here, though not as much as on previous 
releases.  Generally, a must buy if you happen to be a fan.

Felice.
