…The Usual 'All Things come to pass' style bit..

You are now reading Maggie 22 and it is only a little bit late, which 
puts it on the delivery scales somewhere between issue 19 (very late) 
and issue 21 (very early and written to a deadline).. My mind is a 
virtual blank now, which puts it several places above the makers of 
most party political broadcasts..

Still, must think of something to say, or this is going to be a very 
short editorial..


1996, a year..

We came, saw, and did a few things this year, visited Symposium to 
sample a slice of coding convention life.. We also pitched our tent as 
exhibitors at the Autumn Atari Shows, and a damn comprehensive report 
of what happened there can be found in this issue.. Quite a lot of 
deaths and defections, but we won't dwell on these, they are covered 
more than adequately elsewhere.. One of the nice things of '96 has been 
a mini revival of a local Atari scene, and big hellos to Dave Hollis 
and the 'ST+' diskmag team go out to them..

Anyone who wants to see the Maggie Team extend their boundaries by 
going into print should check out Atari Computing, the new paper mag 
launched in the Autumn, we have our own two pages worth, check it out.. 
Issue three is due in February..

1997? Looks like enough happening to keep us interested, as we rapidly 
approach anniversary #7 in the summer.. Hasn't time gone by a bit too 
quickly!


New series of Red Dwarf due just after I finish this issue..

Yippee!! - All I need to say really..


Staying on a Sci-Fi note..

A new series has started on BBC2, from the people who make the 'X-
Files' called 'Space: Above and Beyond' This is a sort of 'Top Gun' 
meets 'Babylon 5' meets 'Battlestar Galactica' type production.. Apart 
from spotting the obviously rendered space ships and special effects, 
you can have fun nit-picking at a lot of the assumptions behind the 
plot.. Such as what is a previously peaceful Earth doing with loads of 
Spacegoing aircraft carriers and assorted military hardware prior to 
the actual alien attack, why are the main characters such cliches from 
all the old war films, and what is a bearded Australian doing as the 
head of the United Nations?? All good clean fun and oddly likeable..


Some new hardware to aspire to..

Well there's the Nemesis!! But I'd better stop that, or Dave Encill 
will never speak to me again.. But seriously folks, this Centek Falcon 
clone sounds like the business, and the first new machine I've lusted 
after for over three years spent in a PC wilderness.. There are a 
shitload of question marks ahead of it, such as how many people will 
develop on it, how much can a company like Centek accomplish, will they 
get foreign distributors going for all us non French people who might 
be interested, and just *how* Atari compatible will it be.. A lot of 
good things have been said, but these remain firmly on paper for now.. 
What actually happens, we'll have to wait and see.. Still Centek do 
have one very big thing going in their favour, they don't have any 
involvement from the Tramiel family whatsoever!!


A timely message for people called Richard Karsmakers to finish with..

Firstly, I don't know how you're reading this, as you haven't got an ST 
or Falcon anymore.. The combination of a PC or Mac, the ST version of 
Maggie and the MagiC O/S for these respective machines might well 
work though.. See the 'Readme.now' for more info..

It is always a good idea to check the 'address' text for any changes 
that might happen in there from time to time, such as a wholesale 
physical change of address that took place over a year ago!!


Sorry, this was a very short and unfocused editorial, wasn't it..
