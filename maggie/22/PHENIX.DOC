1986: The Atari ST launched. Officially the best 16 bit computer. 
1993: The Atari Falcon launched. Everyone's favourite 32 bit computer. 
1997: The next generation...the "Phenix" promises to take us there.
The Centek Phenix is a brand  new  Atari compatible computer made by a 
very innovative  company  in  France.  They  have  studied  the Falcon 
architecture  and  worked  out  where  the  problems  and  performance 
hindering areas are and ironed  them  out.  The have designed an Atari 
compatible super-computer. It is literally bursting with power.
You don't believe me? Just look at the specs:

Nice,   isn't  it ? This machine is like a Falcon, but without all the 
bottlenecks which were slowing down everything  in it. Even the faster 
chip  of  the  Falcon  (DSP)  is  literally a snail, compared with the 
Phenix's one...

  Shortly  :  the  faster  CPU  won't have to worry about feeding the 
faster  56001  compatible  DSP,  which  will  use  its  brand new DMA 
capabilities to transfer data and code from/toward the faster RAM... 
The  DMA  channels  of  the  56302  are  making  it really usable for 
'serious  applications',  like  raytracing,  as the 56001 RAM was too 
slow  to contain this kind of application's large routines. The 683xx 
controller can also be used as a super 32 bits DMA Blitter...

  Now, the Operating System : Dolmen !

  Currently  under  development,  it is a new multitasking OS, which 
will  be  stored  on the computer's hard-disk. The great advantage of 
this  : it can (and will !) be updated easily and on a regular basis. 
You won't have to load hundreds of patches at the boot to fix bugs of 
the in-ROM OS... The reason why Centek's developers wanted to develop 
another  OS  from  scratch  is  that  they  wanted it to be perfectly 
designed  for  the machine, not simply adapted, like the modified TOS 
on the Hades, or MagiC!, which is really unstable...

Some details : 
  - full assembly coded ! -> faster than light ! 

  - 'pre-emptive' multi-task 

  - general memory protection with efficient error 'repairing'... 

  - Centek  Control  Panel,  with  unlimited easy-to-create forms 
(size and number) 

  - AES compatibility 

  - Ultra-ergonomic desktop, with integrated features for fast file 
copy,  hypertext  editor  (for  applications  in-line documentation), 
visual control of system parameters... 

  - A  lot  of  memory  available for applications (Centek hope the 
system kernel to fit into a 64Kb EPROM) 

  - External drivers based system (for graphic boards, and so on...) 

  - a  'Resume'  feature, allowing the user to save the context. On 
next  boot, he will be back in this context within seconds... I'm not 
sure,  but this option will perhaps be usable for games and demos, so 
that  it  automatically  saves the context before loading, and it can 
then  do  everything  it wants with all the memory free, though being 
able to come back to the desktop properly... :) 

  - A lot of other features...

  Moreover, the developers are very open minded to suggestions about 
what shall be Dolmen so, if you have ideas you'd like to communicate, 
they'll  be  happy  to  take note of it, and to implement it, if they 
find it interesting. I often speak with them, and they really seem to 
be competent...

First configuration :

68040, 1 Go SCSI 2 hard disk, SCSI 2 CD-ROM X4, 8 Mo RAM, Matrox 
Mystic. Price less than 10.000 FF (~1250 ). No information if for 
this price, this configuration includes a monitor.

First I must thank  Daniel  of  New  Beat  Developments for sending us 
these  statistics.  Additional  information   by   Hades   of  Tool  8 
technologies. The comments are by Yann Loussarn.

Here is my opinon of the machine.

Starting with CPU:

The good news is that it is  a  Motorola.  The 68040 is a very similar 
chip to the 030 that we  all  know  and love. The instruction sets are 
virtually identical (apart from some extra Cache controlling commmands 
on the '40) but the 68040 does have the advantage of having a built in 
FPU. There is also a nifty  MOVE16  which  moves 16 bytes of data with 
one command!

Althought similar, the '040 is vastly more powerful chip than the '030 
check the performance (and expense) of  boards such as the Afterburner 
'040. When you also consider  the  fact  the  the Centek's 040 will be 
running at  an  amazing  66mhz,  there  is  no  doubting  the  central 
powerhouse that this machine is based on.

There is also the 120Mhz 68060 option, but I imagine this machine will 
be a lot more expensive, and fit  more  into the serious market as the 
TT did. One  for  the  Calamus  users  perhaps.  But  if  this  one is 
reasonably priced, then people may opt  for  the extra power. A 120Mhz 
68060? This is almost criminally fast!

Fortunately these jet propelled processed  aren't  let down by a wimpy 
bus architecture. There is a nice 33Mhz  32bit bus for all the data to 
travel down. Here is an analogy - whilst the Falcon data has to travel 
down a windy  B  road,  the  Phenix's  data  can  roar  down  a 4 lane 
autobahn!

One aspect of the Falcon  that  people  didn't  complain about was the 
DSP.This was because it was an extraordinarily fast and powerful chip. 
But Centek have decided it was too  slow (!) and are replacing it with 
a 66Mhz 56302. This is  over  twice  as  fast  as the original chip! I 
don't know how much memory the chip  has  on  board, as the 96K of the 
56001 was always a serious limitation, as was the fact that you had to 
transmit all data through the slow  8  bit  bus connecting the DSP and 
CPU.

But this is a problem no longer!  The DSP can access main memory! This 
is such a liberating factor. If the only the Falcon's DSP could access 
main memory, it would be twice as  powerful a machine. Not only is the 
Centek's DSP more powerful, but  it  is  not limited by Atari's stupid 
bus architecture.

The new operating system also sounds nice, especially the fact that it 
is coded in assembly which  means  that  it  will whip along. The only 
drawback is  if  they  decide  to  introduce  machine  with  different 
processors (PowerPC, Dec alpha) then  they  will  have to re-write the 
O/S.

The only draw back I can  see  with  this  machine  is that it is a PC 
case. I have always like the ST/Falcon case (despite its crap joystick 
ports) as it has a charm in its crude way, plus it is very portable.
I have never been tempted to buy a PC, but I have always realised that 
there will come a time when I  want something with more power than the 
Falcon. The Phenix seems to be the  ideal machine. If this is released 
for the promised price in the autumn,  I  will be first on the list to 
buy one.

The Phenix seems a fantastic  machine,  and  if enough creative people 
buy one  then  we  can  make  another  great  scene  on  another great 
computer. Atari is dead, long live the atari compatible!
