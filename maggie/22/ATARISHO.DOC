…The Autumn Atari Shows 

28th and 29th September 1996 

And so to the latest 'away team' visitation by Maggie and friends at 
these two very important Atari Shows in Birmingham and London..

These have a little bit of history behind them as we were originally 
going to get an Atari World sponsored show in Spring, but the premature 
death of that magazine took the opportunity away.. Mike Goodman, the 
proprieter of Goodmans PDL organises some new shows for the autumn, 
which ST Format, that beloved Future Publishing institution, decides to 
sponsor.. This seems to have a fatal effects on them, as STF then go 
down the pan as well, leaving the outcome of the shows somewhat 
uncertain to say the least..

Mike G. steps in to safeguard the shows, and in a conversation that got 
lost between Felice, Mike, and the gatepost, the 'Maggie Team', ie. 
'us', are pencilled in to appear behind a stand as well!

Various other things happen directly after the death of STF.. Mike G. 
reports a lot more interest in the shows than previously, as people 
realise that it might be their last chance to find out what is going on 
Atari-Wise as there is now no news-stand magazine left.. Also, the new 
subscription only 'Atari Computing' magazine is set to appear here with 
their launch issue, replacing ST Format.. The show was getting more and 
more interesting with each passing week..

Additionally, Dave 'ST+' Hollis opted to come down to the show with us, 
and this being his first visit to such a gathering, was greatly looked 
forward to by him..

++Maggie 21!++

At about six weeks to the show, it is decided to release Maggie 21 at 
the show venues in spite of some fairly major handicaps, which 
consisted of the lack of articles at that stage, and extreme laziness 
on our part up to then.. However certain other parts of the Maggie Team 
had been working very hard, with the result that we have a huge backlog 
of game reviews still to put in the magazine (thanks Leon and Tash!)

The other parts of the impressive Maggie production machine swing into 
action as many more articles, a revamped ST version shell program, and 
even a couple of demo intros are produced, including one which kicks a 
lot of ass on the ST.. Anyway, organising this gives me more than 
enough to do in the short term in the weeks and days before the show..

Maggie 21 is done and put to bed after a splash through a few minor 
bugs and threats of postal strikes, with the very very last minute 
stuff being done on the friday night before.. 

Anyway, enough of the hopeful previews, and on with a splurge of show 
related reporting!

++Saturday!++

It is 1.00am in the morning, and thankfully no-one has phoned at this 
unearthly hour to ask if I am going to the shows.. I have just finished 
copying and testing some spare copies of the finished Maggie 21, and I 
am going to bed after packing my Falcon into the waiting travel bag 
ready for an early start in just a few hours from now..

Now 6.00am, and slowly waking up with the dawn.. Too much darkness 
outside, although that slowly lifts as I get ready.. Among other 
things, I get some food organised, remembering that the food 
arrangements at the Birmingham venue were neither brilliant nor cheap.. 
It just remains for Felice and his car to arrive on the stroke of 
seven..

7.10am.. Phone rings..

Aha, kindly old Mr Fuckup, a frequent guest star at these kind of 
occasions, has visited Felice's premises and put a metaphorical crowbar 
through his alarm clock.. Felice will be a tad late, which will 
probably still be alright, as the show does not start until 10.00am.. 
Good job I finished Maggie off the night before then.. Quickly ring 
Dave Hollis to tell him about the problem and sit back and relax 
awhile, or at least, relax as best I can, aware that time is getting 
shorter than I would have liked..

Felice turns up a bit before 8.00am in a glitter of shiny metal and 
apologies, we load his car up with my gear, skirting past the covered 
monster of the giant display television on his back seat.. The present 
status of Maggie team is basically two Falcons, two normal RGB 
monitors, the huge telly, and some PC-type 'boom-box' speakers which 
tuck away snugly in the passenger seat footwell twixt the big telly..

A little bit later.. Pick up Dave H. at Northampton from ST+ GHQ.. Next 
major item on the cockup event horizon is a distinct lack of spare 
space for Dave's stuff, and he has to leave most of it behind.. In 
spite of this, Dave is squeezed into the back seat, along with an 
unfeasibly huge rucksack, with which he is engaged in an eternal 
wrestling match, at least until we get to Birmingham.. Dave does bring 
along his STe, which does not make it out of the rucksack at all, and 
his lunch, which does..

The journey to Birmingham is not at all eventful, and about an hour 
later, we arrive at the National Motorcycle Museum for the first of the 
weekends Atari indulging orgies.. A large selection of vans and cars 
with people unloading various computery bits gives away the fact that 
this is the show venue.. We go in to find our alloted space, miss it 
the first time of looking, but find it again with the help of infra-red 
imaging cameras that are specially designed to look for small concealed 
objects.. 

We are sharing the space with other user groups, most notably the 
Wessex Atari Group, representing the might of the UK association of 
Atari User Groups.. 'Sharing' the available space translates to picking 
up what is left, and we unload onto the one tiny table which *just 
about* takes the weight of two Falcons, monitors, and the huge telly.. 
Still, setting up is straightforward, and only the big telly is hernia 
producing as we carry it the unsteady twenty or so yards from the car..

9.30am..
Plonking the provided 'Maggie Team' sign atop the Frankenstein sized 
screen and squeezing my mousemat between the two Falcons, we switch on 
and prepare for some serious Maggie based action!

As there is still a bit of time before the show opens its doors to the 
public, I have a quick skirt around the other stands still in various 
stages of setupedness.. Coming across Merlin, who very much look like 
they are on their last major show, and are here to promote their new 
online service 'Libris'.. Still, nice to see them again..

Next up is the Atari Computing stand with various team members 
including Mike Kerslake and Joe Connor, and I get my first look at the 
new magazine.. I was going to subscribe in a slightly dutiful sense 
anyway, but very much like the look of the new mag, and end up handing 
over my cheque rather more enthusiastically instead.. The mag looks 
like a black and white version of 'Atari World', but with an extra 
'non-serious' dimension added by the user groups and diskzine pages 
including our own two pages.. It is also nice to see a truly objective 
page of diskmag reviews!!! ;-)

More on the magazine elsewhere in Maggie, but Atari Computing was to 
become the major success story of the shows..

Moving around the show we take in Titan Designs who are demonstrating 
both the legendary 'Nemesis' accelerator, and a very early version of 
Apex 3.. Neither of these are for sale, as Nemesis just missed the show 
by a few days, and full production had not actually happened as yet.. 
They do have Falcon 14MB memory upgrades for a rather gut-busting œ129, 
but I am not quite tempted just yet.. We see a bit more of Doug and co 
towards the end of the London show on Sunday..

System Solutions (Karl B's Boys!) are out in force, and are showing 
quite a lot, and topping the lot is the Hades TT clone based around a 
Motorola '060 CPU capable of making the average Pentium  based 
Gatesmobile PC look puny and shrink-wrapped.. It is on the vicious side 
of two grand though, so no luck there! Also a software ST emulator for 
various machines including PC's and MagiC based Intel machines called 
'MagiC PC' which sounds like it has managed to do quite a lot on a 
single H/D disk.. new versions of the MagiC O/S, and various CD-Roms 
also go on the stand.. Hiding away are the Panther graphics cards for 
the 'humble' ST series of computers, the new 'Infopedia CD-ROM 
encyclopaedia, a new art package Photoline, and more..

Swing around, we also take in Goodmans, and 16/32 who are unloading 
their stands still.. Nearby, a waiting BeST electronics with the 
faithful Brad Koda awaits, other attendees include the Upgrade Shop, 
Floppyshop with Positive Image, and Calamus User Group.. Also HiSoft 
and some Midi folk are there as well, and hard by our own stand is the 
Console Centre, majoring on Jaguar and Lynx games..

10.00am

Doors open!

I am still flibbing around the centre of the hall when the first 
members of the public start to tickle into the show.. I glimpse our own 
stand in the far corner, which is putting on a creditable performance 
with Tat's Maggie 21 ST intro twisting Sam Tramiel through a tumble 
dryer like motion on the big screen, and figure that is a good place to 
go back to.. The days visitors start to arrive now..

(Father forgive me, for my memory is not too good as to who arrived 
first, but I'll have a decent stab at guessing anyway!)

It is the face of NEIL, or Arnel that comes to mind as being the first 
Maggie related person to arrive.. A face not seen since Symposium and 
very much welcome too.. Next up (I think) are Tat and Kev Dempsey not 
too long afterwards.. Tat is his usual smiling self and Kev has kept 
whatever vivid hair colour he currently favours hidden away with an 
all-covering baseball cap.. Leon and Tash soon after that, Mike Noyce 
and all, and soon the little space around our stand is packed out with 
Maggie Team people and related fellow travellers.. People are pointed 
to the different parts of the show, purchase copies of 'Atari 
Computing', comment on the objectivity of the diskmag reviews, leave 
bags and coats in the space behind our stand, burying carefully 
prepared by exhibition staff packed lunches out of sight, and mixing up 
everyones personal effects into a cloth porridge in a ghastly re-run of 
the Maggie Birthday Party episode "Whose coat is it anyway?"

Coming along a bit later still is Ed Cleveland who managed a painless 
journey by bus and train right up to the National Exhibition Centre 
(NEC), but then found out that the motorcycle museum is rather less 
accessible from there.. At this time, various interesting previews are 
being loaded onto my hard drive, including some very early routines for 
the Avena Sonoluminescenz demo (except the ones that Kev forgot to 
bring with him!) Also going on there is a very early preview of the new 
Reservoir Gods game based on the old arcade classic 'Spyhunter'.. Ed 
manages to put a few previews of his own on there too, including a 
hilarious spoof on a LucasSoft PC release 'Day of the Tentacle' called 
'Donkey Island!' Also, much demo watching follows, including the much 
loved AN Cool Falcon demo 'Crystal', and some other demos that got 
progressively less loved, especially at the London show, but more on 
that issue later on folks!   

Felice turns up with a tray of drinks to remind me of that lesser known 
Simon and Garfunkel lyric "Hello dehydration my old friend", and the 
coke in question does not even get to touch the sides of my throat as 
it hits the stomach with a sizzling roar.. Freed to go and look around 
for a little while, I come across a very familiar figure with two other 
menacing dudes in tow near the Calamus User Stand.. These turn out to 
be Tony Greenwood, Deano, of Stosser fame, and Keefy of 'Warp' 
notoriety.. Tony and co are reeled in to enjoy the new issue of Maggie, 
and are in turn, pounced upon by a delighted Dave H. who is meeting his 
hero for the first time.. A surprised Tony is also introduced to Ed 
Cleveland, one of his favourite writers in Maggie 20.. No blood is 
shed.. At least none that I could see..

A procession makes its way upstairs to the bar, to fulfil an age old 
ritual, the downing of several cans of Tiger Bitter! I join in shortly 
afterwards, carefully avoiding the other ritual of 'paying grossly over 
the odds for a plate of cardboard pseudo-chips' having disinterred my 
food from the cloth mess on the floor of the stand.. On a nearby table, 
Tony, Keefy, Deano and Dave H sit, looking more like the cast of a 
gangster movie or the game 'Mobsters City' than ever as they plot in 
hushed voices..

Time passes ever so slowly until a certain Welsh person turns up and 
announces his presence.. Kev Davies also tells us that Mike Noyce is 
getting teed off with minding the Maggie stand, and extremely thirsty.. 
We are all a little bit unsteady from our enforced Tiger bingeing, so 
the ever dutiful narrator/editor does the right thing..

..And sends Felice downstairs with a vague promise that he will follow 
shortly!

However, I do plunge back into the fray a little bit later to find Ed 
Cleveland doing all sorts of scarey things with my Falcon, and another 
little dude who seems to belong to Dave H's lot hanging around the 
stand stroking his chin thoughtfully.. This latter personage turns out 
to be Steve Moore, the assembly language correspondent for ST+. He is 
trying to puzzle out why the early batch of issue 9 of that mag is 
failing so dismally on the Maggie Falcons, and commenting in such a 
manner that suggests a fifteen year old mad german rocket scientist is 
on the case "Achh so, I think it izz korruption to zer disk!" and so 
on.. However, enough stereotypical funnies later, and he turns out to 
be  really a rather nice chap..

The afternoon slides by in a Tiger-induced blur, we get our demos and 
diskmags out for the lads, pump up the volume, and so on.. One thing 
that gets hordes of interested casual observers is the preview of the 
Doom clone 'Running', shown on the big screen, and pulled apart by a 
frenzied Steven Moore, this gets a lot of people looking at us. Some 
other people drop by, but seem to be less interested "Oh we're just 
keeping someone company," they say, and are looking frenziedly to the 
fire escape doors when we try to show them something.. Probably lost 
the plot computing-wise, when the Amstrad PCW first came out!

Tat performs some strange ritual of buying postcards of the Motorcycle 
museum and the beautiful sights of Birmingham (three, all of them kept 
in secure locations by wealthy private collectors!) He gets us all to 
sign with our watery and indistinct signatures in the bottom corner, 
and then he sent these cards out to various personalities in the 
'Scene', who no doubt decided that the old Mad Cow disease was biting a 
bit too hard here in the UK, and vowed to cut off all remaining 
communications for fear of cross infection or something..

Suddenly, people are leaving, as we start on a long series of tearful 
goodbyes, as various team people leave the building for the last time.. 
The previously manic paced show is winding down, and we have  a bit 
more time and space to wander the floor once more.. Stopping by 
Goodmans to follow up earlier reports of another 'Doom' or Sub-Station 
clone for the STFM.. The game is interesting, in that you get to shoot 
to death, several violently aggressive gingerbread men, but nothing too 
great technically, at least on the surface..

Stopping also by Atari Computing, who have smug grins several miles 
wide, and several 'sold out' signs hoisted over the tattered remnants 
of their stand.. They have sold out of the entire run of the first 
issue, apart from those copies that they forced themselves to keep hold 
of for the London Show tomorrow.. The original 'break-even' print run 
of 500 was exceeded by several hundred, and over the two days of the 
show, these totally sold out! A very large part of what they took was 
in the form of three issue subscriptions, assuring a future for this 
new magazine (Further updated post-show info suggests that a further 
print of the first issue has been taken up as there is still 
unsatisfied demand for the magazine!)

All too soon, it is time to leave, as the assorted show people start to 
pack away. I stop and browse the Wessex Atari Group's 'Virtual Web 
Site' and chat over the day's events with the team there.. We unload  
the car in reverse (eh? - Ed), Felice and the big telly ending up in a 
squashed mass on the back seat of his car.. Dave and I wait in the car 
whilst Felice has a last check around, I sit there, waiting for my 
headache to subside, and Dave H appears to have immensely enjoyed the 
show to the point where he could die happy.. We're all fit only for the 
knackers yard anyway by this time.. Dave suggests going down to the 
show with someone else, in order to get his equipment down there.. We 
go home quietly and with even less trouble than on the way up..

Later..

Food, a bath, and sleep, these all come very easily, and even after 
making some more copies of Maggie 21, I am in bed well before midnight 
to try to get some rest before the commencement of round two on Sunday 
Morning..

++Sunday!++

6.00am, and slowly waking up with the dawn..

There is too much darkness outside, although that is slowly lifting.. 
It is also windier than yesterday, with wild boasts of rain to follow.. 
A little flashing light on my ansaphone, previously unseen, suggests 
that something interesting has gone on overnight without me knowing..

The message burbles out and it is Dave H, who has changed his mind 
about coming down to the London show, this is a shame, but we are to 
have the company of Matt Smith and his Falcon instead..

700am.. Once again, I get packed and ready, and this time, I am to make 
the journey down with my car.. Unlike yesterday, Felice does arrive on 
time, and in but a few minutes, all the equipment is transferred to my 
car, journey commences..

The journey down is without major incident, although with major 
weather, which consists of squally downpours and brief anguished pauses 
for the weather to get its breath back before resuming the attack.. 
Both motorways used to get us to Osterly are not too thrilling when you 
can't see them that well, but we make good time to the Four Pillars 
Hotel, which springs out at as from the roadside almost before we see 
it.. parking up, we find the same collection of people unloading 
furiously, and quickly find our allotted place in the hall, and Matt 
Smith and friend..

About 8.30am.. Unloading is easy with the extra hands, and I cunningly 
avoid having anything to do with the big television.. Unloading is 
easy, but tables aren't, as most of these are still in use by popular 
demand of the breakfasting guests of the Hotel.. Both ourselves and the 
Wessex Boys of the UKAAUG are waiting for some table shaped objects to 
turn up. Today, we are on the stage overlooking the main hall, standing 
immediately above Merlin, the Calamus User Group and System Solutions.. 
There is more room on the stage, the extra comfort factor is welcomed 
by us, and which made a big difference to how I felt by the days end.. 
New here today is Colin Fisher-McAllum of the Atariphile Diskmag, 
another familiar face very nice to see..

Whilst waiting for certain long pieces of wood to turn up, we briefly 
amuse ourselves by sticking the UKAAUG sign on some pipework above the 
stage, and watch it unstick itself and fall down moments later, glibly 
predicting that with the inadequate amount of sticky tape and bluetack 
used, that such a thing would have happened anyway.. A dapper gentleman 
of senior years also turns up with a briefcase.. He is the 
representative of the 'Wrinklies' User Group,the senior Atarians club.. 
We ask where he needs to set up his equipment, he points to a pile of 
pamphlets in the briefcase and says "It's all here.." We are still 
waiting for some tables to turn up..

9.30am
Tables start to grudgingly turn up, and table cloths too.. First system 
set up is my Falcon, with the SID music player and speakers playing the 
rest in.. At this point, the whole of our section is running off one 
extension, which has a red light which is flickering in an alarming red 
fashion.. We worry for a while, wondering if the whole electronic 
shooting match ensemble is going to blow, but it doesn't, and we let 
out the deep breath that we've all been holding onto for the last 
couple of minutes.. Nothing happens during the day, no loud bang under 
the table, or suddenly appearing blue smoke, even when we've got the 
volume pumped up, so that seems to be okay..

I look around the show for the last time before the doors, open, 
kidnapping a few stray chairs that wandered unwisely from their owners 
reach.. At least we will be comfortable today.. The layout of this show 
is somewhat different from the day before, as instead of one big 
central hall, there are also side pockets containing 16/32, the Console 
Centre, the Atari Computing magazine and the Portfolio Users Group. The 
main hall has the bigger stands such as Titan Designs, who got there 
relatively late and are now struggling to set up in time, HiSoft, 
Sunrise Audio, the MIDI people, System Solutions, Floppyshop, Goodmans, 
Merlin and all.. We are in a dominating position looking down from the 
stage at the top of the hall..

The first of the days many performances booms out loudly from our part 
of the hall, Felice is soundchecking the Obnoxious Demo, the first of 
many appearances from that demo, and Merlin, immediately beneath us, 
are screwing their ears shut with pain and pleading with us to stop..

..To no avail..

10.00am
Doors open, and the punters once again breach the stronghold.. Today is 
more of a 'public day' as the attendees from yesterday who livened up 
the Birmingham event are not to return today.. However, we are 
expecting a few new faces to turn up during the course of the day.. We 
actually do get a few very new faces peering around in an interested 
fashion, and I find myself playing an 'official' role a few times to 
different people, including one chap who lives in Rutland who read 
about the Maggie Party and wished he could have come down.. Another 
person is impressed by Tat's efforts both on the issue 21 ST intro, 
various Falcon intros, and early 'rushes' of the new Avena demo.. 

Arto!
About mid-morning, a familar face from Symposium appears, as Arto, 
another contributor to issue 21 arrives.. Initially disappointed that 
Leon did not visit today, he takes in interest in various Maggie 
related proceedings, and smiles with quiet pride when the Maggie 21 
Falcon intro is run.. I am also treated to his expert commentary when 
various other demos are run, ("Too slow , but nice looking..") We talk 
about various happenings in the French scene, and he goes off to take 
in the rest of the show..

It is hot on the stage, there is strong overhead lighting, and someone 
thoughtfully turns up with a tray of drinks, which do not stay around 
for too long a time.. Somewhere to my right, a series of booming 
crashes announces the start of the 'Bugs from Outer Space' demo..

Felice wanders off for a while, leaving me in charge of the stand, so I 
am showing more of Maggie to people, wishing for a special 'show' mode 
where Maggie is left to load, scroll down, and quit articles at 
random.. How about it Leon?

Arto returns for a while, and spends some more time with us before 
leaving the show.. In spite of Leon not being there, I get the 
impression that he did enjoy the show..  Soon after, another semi-
familiar face arrives, recognisable from an artistically mangled 
portrait seen in ST+ Diskmag, it is Pete Augustin, who was hoping to 
meet Dave H. here today, and was disappointed not to.. However, he is 
soon at home with us, as we impress the fur-lined booties off him with 
Maggie in its various guises, and try, and fail to get ST+ issue 9 to 
run from my Falcon, not realising at the time that the problem was raw 
and naked STOS which had not been fixed for the Falcon.. A little more 
demo, and multichannel music related mayhem leaves him blubbing and 
wanting a Falcon desperately..

Felice returns, and I go to see how the show is progressing in a mid-
show update mood.. A brief rescue mission from Floppyshop for some of 
Dave H's disks, and everything is much the same as yesterday.. Atari 
Computing have sold out again, I have my eye on the only major purchase 
of the day, a diskbox from Merlin!! This is more than slightly sad of 
me, but there was nothing really tempting that had come out on sale 
with Nemesis missing the show and no really new CD-ROMs either.. 

Nick Harman of 16/32 suggested that several new releases in the silver 
platter department such as Crawly Crypt 3 had just missed the show as 
well.. We did try out System Solutions 'Bird of Prey' CD on Matt's 
Falcon, but there is nothing really new on there either, that 
collection was only a few months younger than 'Transmission', although 
it did have the sublime good taste to have Maggie 18 on there..

Felice did purchase the not widely available 'Defender 2000' for his 
Jaguar (Review in Maggie shortly!), and the Console Centre was also 
running 'Fight for Life' on their stand.. The only other expenditure, 
the day before, was a batch of old and tired ex-Atari Basic language 
disks which were going *very* cheap from Merlin.. So, in reply to Ed 
Cleveland who wrote in last issues 'Dirk' that there was no such thing 
as an unformatted Atari language disk, I now have about fifty of them!! 
Avid collectors of crap are welcome to write to the usual Maggie 
correspondance address, but hurry! With such a large stock of quality 
memorabilia, demand is bound to be high, and they will sell out!, Or I 
will have reformatted all the disks shortly, or something.. 

The large figure of a man called Gareth, a link with an ancient long 
dead past, now blocks out our available sunlight.. Gareth, who used to 
be part of our local scene at the Wellingboro' Club is that interesting 
sub-species, the reluctant Atarian.. Having been in the process of 
getting something else for the past three years, but not quite managing 
to.. Gareth has been to IKEA before coming to the show, but he is 
suspiciously light of Swedish pine-stripped wardrobes.. After spending 
a little time around us, he goes off to lurk in the vicinity of BeST 
Electronics..

I drift near to the Hisoft stand, which is running an MPEG decoder 
which attaches to a SCSI CD-ROM,and plays back MPEG movie disks, yes, 
the real thing, as a rolling 'demo' of Hugh Grunt and Andie MacVowel in 
'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is playing..

Without Danish subtitles.....

A visit to Sunrise Audio takes in their recased Falcon music 
workstation.. Another bit of 'must-have' kit, if you've got a few 
thousand spondoolies to spare, which a lot of musicians do have..

Back at the stand, and a couple of crudely name-tagged dudes drop in, 
they are there on behalf of Kelstar Diskmag, and have a little notepad 
containing a realtime article! This seems to have started from their 
waking moments, and goes on for a bit.. We are invited to donate ink to 
it, and we do, reflecting on the early casualty that would have been 
our own attempt at a realtime text, had space/time/circumstances 
allowed it to take place..

Obnoxious demo thunders out for the umpteenth time..

Later still..
The show is starting to get to the later stages, and is yawning loudly 
and wanting to go to bed.. Thoughts turn to packing up, but not before 
various people express an interest in the Cream SID player that I've 
been playing loudly, in between the other stuff. Doug Little and co 
(Sorry other chap, I've forgotten your name!) turn up with their hard 
drive, and some serious updating of demos and diskmags follows.. Rob at 
System Solutions wants a copy of the SID player as well.. In the 
meantime, at the Matt Smith end of things, a huge amount of 
daisychaining of external SCSI devices takes place, as Felice's machine 
is subjected to CD-ROM-o-mania on a huge scale.. Attempts to get it to 
talk to my (early) version of Extendos don't go quite as planned, 
although some nice game demos, including the brilliant Technoball are 
picked up.. The likely guilty party on this occasion being the weird 
version of AHDI that Doug Little used earlier to get his SCSI to talk 
to my machine..

All finished, and starting to pack up, and we remember in a moment of 
suppressed panic the poor little extension that was carrying all that 
electricity during the day.. We look under the table, and it is still 
there, not smouldering.. It is no doubt relieved to be switched off and 
packed away.. I move the car closer to the rear exit doors of the show, 
all the less distance to carry the large television.. We soon load up, 
the big television slumping into my boot with much cursing.. We are 
ready to leave, but stop by to say a farewell to the remaining parties 
packing up, such as the System Solutions people, and Mikey G. himself..

Journey home..

Less said about this one, the better..

Well, it was getting dark, and still raining.. We find our way out of 
London after a little initial confusion with a road sign that pointed 
us to where we wanted to go, but shrugged its shoulders in a gallic 
fashion and left us on our own after a little while. Getting onto the 
M25 is fairly straightforward, but everybody else living in London is 
on there as well, and traffic is moving in a semi-paralysed gridlock 
fashion.. After about an hours worth of slow agonised crawling, we find 
'our' motorway, the M1, and start to make better time.. It is still 
raining, and visibility, always an issue on the way down, is even worse 
now.. Still, we do finally get home, somewhere around 8pm, and after 
transferring Felice's stuff to his car, and generally unloading, sit 
down, profoundly relieved, and not in any shape to attempt writing a 
show report, just then..

(**M25 Handy Hints!!**)
Overpaid and mentally underpowered BMW owners, why not dash at full 
speed up to the point where the slip road joins the motorway proper, 
brake at the very last second, and try to slip in, forcing everyone on 
the motorway behind them to brake suddenly, and disrupting the smooth 
flow of traffic, thus making everything a lot slower than it needs to 
be..

Oh yes, and randomly switching lanes with little or no warning is 
another good one to try as well..

++Conclusions++
Yes, this was certainly different from anything that we've attended 
before, and we're profoundly grateful to Mike Goodman from giving us 
the chance to experience a gathering like this from the exhibitors 
point of view.. The value of having a 'Maggie' stand extended to our 
compatriots and fellow team members who had a central focal point, and 
a stronger than usual reason to go and visit.. It also served for a bit 
of free advertising for us, although we suspect that most people going 
to these shows would be already familiar with us to some extent..

The shows were well attended, and were a success from that 
perspective.. The closure of ST Format, and the opening of the new 
magazine 'Atari Computing' were strong motivators to go down as well 
for many people, uncertain of what was going to happen next.. The 
significance of these shows gained a lot when STF closed, as this could 
have been the last opportunity to go and visit one.. (Although it looks 
like there will be more shows in the early part of next year..)

From a 'product' point of view, not quite as good as previous shows, as 
certain things just did not quite make it in time, although people 
*not* looking for a Nemesis board, but perhaps into rare Jaguar 
games, might have been happier.. Atari Computing, the new magazine had 
a very successful show, and this occasion was invaluable in getting 
that magazine off to an unbeatable start..

As always, great people, and memorable times, even one or two people 
such as Arto that you might not normally expect to see here (he was 
handily in the UK  at that time!) And that always makes these sort of 
gatherings worthwhile..

Would we do it again?
