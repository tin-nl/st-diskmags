They thought it was all over!!

(They were wrong!!)

Cast your mind back to last July.. Atari World had already closed down 
through the most hideous bad luck on the part of their parent company.. 
Now ST Format, in the safe and capable hands of Future Publishing (It's 
the size of your wallet that counts!) was also going to depart the 
shores of Atariland, something which was not altogether a total 
surprise to a lot of people.. In the panic stricken whispering of the 
immediate crisis, rumours of a new magazine started to appear..

These became solid pretty quickly, with Mike Kerslake, a publisher and 
Atari enthusiast stepping in to offer his services for a subscription 
based magazine which would be run as an enthusiasts concern, rather 
than as a hardnosed profit machine in the manner of Future Publishing..

Quite a lot of detailed work was done early on, the services of one Joe 
Connor were engaged on the editorial side of things.. And in contrast 
to other earlier Atari paper efforts, quite a large input from User 
groups was sought.. That even included Maggie getting a couple of pages 
to run.. (Which is why you get our ugly mugs plastered in issue one on 
the bottom of page 46!)

The one concern was that the magazine might not get the 'critical mass' 
of readership to keep it at a substainable level.. Initial news of the 
new magazine was spread online, and available only to the minority of 
Atari Users who were attached to a modem..

Cut forward to the Atari Shows, a seminal event for 1996 (see separate 
show reports) and issue one has its debut.. Fears of not getting the 
required level of interest proved groundless as the magazine sold out 
totally and even had to be reprinted to meet demand.. Clearly a 
subscription based paper publication could be made to work, but just 
how good is it??

The important bit.. The stuff before was just waffle..

Atari Computing is a 60 page paper magazine priced at 3 ukp for this 
issue, or 9 ukp for a three issue subscription.. All but ten of the 60 
pages have article text, the remaining ten used for advertising 
purposes.. It has a nice glossy cover (Black and white) with a smart 
rendered title picture on the front by Phil Matthews, and a smart 
masthead title created by Graham Rutt.. The overall look is less 
cluttered than ST Format, and seems to use design elements more 
strongly than Atari World.. Maybe its those cool shades of grey that do 
it.. Certainly a strongly attractive cover design that may have tempted 
a few waverers in..

Inside, the first couple of pages have an advert from the Upgrade Shop 
that looks somewhat photocopied.. The next pages have the main contents 
and editorial writings which are self explanatory, and laid out in a 
similar manner to Atari World.. The first important pages are the news 
pages, which contain a mixture of current events (Photoline, Apex 3) 
and the rather older news (Power PD to close, Battle Bowls, a game 
previewed some time ago in STF).. Still, they had to take whatever was 
available, and news coverage will get more evenly up to date for future 
issues, no doubt..

Getting to page ten, and a letters page.. A bit premature for a new mag 
possibly, but no doubt, people have been having their say by email.. 
Various views on the demise of STF and Atari..

The first review is of a comms nature, with cost conscious modem heads 
grateful for a hands on evaluation of CoSTa, a phone bill monitor.. 
Their reviewing system is similar to Atari World, with a percentage 
given at the end of the review.. 

The first feature is also of a comms nature, with Harry Sideras 
providing a novices guide to hooking onto the bulletin board network.. 
This promises to be the first of a series on the subject..

The next article is a major (three page) review of MagiC version 4, 
which gets a thorough write up from Kev Beardsworth.. All the articles 
up to here, and throughout the rest of the mag, are illustrated by 
several attractive, if black and white, screenshots of the products in 
action.. 

A quick single page blast through HD Driver follows, then Kadinsky 
2.5.. The next article of a tutorial nature follows on page 22.. This 
is a useful couple of pages on hard drive management, with a little 
addendum as to how the things actually work.. This is another one that 
promises to be a series, and comes courtesy of Howard Carson..

A beginners guide to MIDI, sampling, and digital recording from Ed 
McGlone sprawls over the next three pages.. This has elements of how to 
get started, but mainly looks at the different parts of these..

On page 29, another old familiar face turns up with the solitary game 
review for this issue, Nial Grimes reviews Dead or Alive, a shareware 
version of Cannon Fodder..

As if to show off the wide range of topics that Atari Computing is 
prepared to tackle, we now get 'The Joy of Sticks', or Xav's 
fascinating proposals to connect a Jaguar Joypad to the standard nine-
pin ST joystick port to use the Jagpad with standard ST games (it can 
be done!) 

The next feature is a more down to earth assessment of how to edit 
resource of .RSC files.. Another informative work, this one by Mark 
Baines..

We are now in the mid-thirties page count, and are in the first of the 
User groups, with a two page spread by STAG, the Scottish Atari group, 
with a brief history, aims for the future etc.. Over the next page, a 
similar sort of thing is provided by our friends at WAG, the Wessex 
Atari Group.. A mugshot of two of the members was provided by our very 
own Felice who had Expose and his camcorder set up at the summer WAG 
meeting grabbing megs worth of unsuspecting victims onto his hard disk 
whilst it was left running.. I'll bet not a lot of people wanted to 
know that!

The next section is very reminiscent of one of the best bits of Atari 
World, that is, the Joe Connor inspired Public Domain/Shareware reviews 
pages.. These are laid out in a very similar manner, and we all cheer 
loudly.. This goes on to include a page worth of diskmag reviews, and 
we applaud the objectivity of an editorial policy that does not have a 
critical blind spot to sci-fi orientated diskmags, especially compared 
to other types of diskmags, unlike a certain other recently deceased 
paper publication edited by someone with the initials 'N' and 'P'!!

**What the world has been waiting for!!**

Pages 46 and 47, probably the finest bits of the mag.. These are of 
course, the Maggie pages!!

Maggie starts out on a fairly low key note with a brief (written by 
Felice) editorial/introductory text, and goes on to include one of the 
interviews with Energiser of Lazer, an article originally seen in DBA 
mag, and a very old back article from Del Staples.. There is some 
attractive picture material provided with the Lazer interview.. Watch 
out for issue two which will have some original writings with suitable 
screenshots about the demo scene!!

Atariphile have their say next, which is mainly taken up with a big 
review of E-Copy, and a smaller review of Stewart, a MagiC related 
utility..

The next three pages jump in with Calamus User, and force such a 
radical change in style and layout, that it looks like an advertising 
feature at first glance.. Indeed, a page of it turns out to be an 
advert for Calamus User..

A brief piece from Colin Fisher-Mcallum adds to the earlier Harry 
Sideras effort about the mysteries of the comms network, and shares 
some of the guru's secrets with the rest of us..

The final three pages of article related text deal with readers 
technical queries, again very much in the format of past issues of 
Atari World or ST Format.. The final two inner pages have a very well 
laid out advert by LAPD, and the back cover, one by Titan Designs..

Is it any good??

Hopefully, the review should give you an idea of what to expect.. The 
writers for Atari Computing are doing it on their own time, and are 
tending to write on their own areas of expertise.. Hence, such things 
as comms, and higher end operating systems might well seem to dominate 
this first issue.. However, with such inclusions as the Maggie pages, 
expect to see a bit of variation from this, so at least Atari Computing 
will be more diverse and less 'dry' than Atari World.. Generally, the 
writing was of the highest standards, and drew most influences from 
Atari World, the 'orthodox' news stand magazine that most people would 
have liked to have seen carried on.. There was not one article that 
seemed to be 'weak' or out of place in here.. The writing team all 
performed very well, with the exception of us, who slacked around with 
back articles this time around.. 

This first issue was extremely well put together for an 'amateur' 
effort, and reflects the high degree of expertise still lurking within 
the Atari community in the UK.. We are proud to be part of this 
magazine ourselves, and hope it will go on for many issues yet..

(For Future Issues..) As a sneaky insiders tip, expect to see a 
comprehensive guide and history of ST News, the famous Dutch diskzine, 
from the ex-editor of Skynet Times, John Nott (VoGue).. From us, expect 
to see various writings on the demo scene forming at least part of 
future Maggie pages, and taken from our own news sources!!
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ  
Issue 2 update note! This was released in early December 1996, featured 
a print run trebled from the initial estimates for issue 1, four extra 
pages (now 64 pages) more adverts, and a boosted print quality as 
well.. Maggie pages and individual contributions were strongly featured 
as well..
