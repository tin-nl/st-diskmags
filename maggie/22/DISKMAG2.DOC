Å(NOT QUITE) THE AND LAST OF
 THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DISK MAGAZINE ROUNDUPS!
 Part 2: "Erotica" to "RTS Track" 
 by Richard Karsmakers
Current updates by Maggie

 
Erotica

 A new defunct American porn magazine with a mediocre ST medium- 
res shell, offering nudy pics, sex-phone stories and vibrator-and 
sex book-reviews.
 Status: Pubic Domain.
 User interface: Yes, GEM oriented thingy.
 Latest known issue: 2.
 Address: Irrelevant.
 Health: Died during The Act.
 Language: English.
 
Eye on Scene 

 When "Massive Mag" (Cf.) folded, some of the members of the 
Admirables went on to do "Eye on Scene". It's a magazine aimed 
primarily at the ST/E, though there is also Falcon coverage. It 
works on all systems, anyway.
 It's supposed to have a really good shell, it's "different from 
the regular diskmag scene" and it's done by Tommi Koistinen, 
a.k.a. Nirvana of the Admirables. The first issue was released 
around the end of 1994.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: A custom one, supposed to be good.
 Latest known issue: Issue 2 (spring or summer 1995).
 Address: Kotimaenkuja 2, 27230 Lappi TL, Finland.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
Fair Play

 A disk magazine that I only read something about. No details are 
known, but the user interface is said to be crap, the articles 
few (something like 10) and its directory scattered (source: "RTS 
Track").
 
Falcon Magazine

 A Ñweekly but unfortunately rather short-lived disk magazine 
especially for the Falcon. The first issue came out on June 28th 
1993. Its editor was Jos van Roosmalen. The first two issues were 
text files on disk, less than 50 Kb in size, and the rest of the 
disk was filled with various source material and programs. It is 
a shame that this magazine ceased to exist so quickly, because it 
was a most excellent way to get the best from your Falcon, even 
though it was written in Dutch. Issue 3 (mid July) saw the 
introduction of a GEM interface, but it was very sloppy (though 
"MultiTOS" compatible!).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Issue 3.
 Address: Not important.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: Dutch.
 
Falcon Update Digital

 A Falcon magazine that, as of issue 6, has a Falcon specific 
shell that incorporates such nifty things as 256 colour FLI 
animation, picture display (GIF, TARGA, IFF and RAW), DSP- 
replayed modules, multiple text windows open, and compatibility 
with "NVDI", "MultiTOS", VGA, RGB and any TOS 4.xx. It's not as 
perfect as it sounds, but a good and sizeable magazine 
nonetheless. Needs 1 Mb to run, but also needs a hard drive!
 With the ending of Falcon Owners Group Activities earlier in 
1996, the magazine also came to a dead stop as well.. However, 
rumour control was unable to entirely suppress stories of an all 
new and brilliant custom menu shell, up to the standards of 
current 'Maggie' and 'DBA' issues.. With VoGue, the former editor 
of Skynet Times taking over, there is a serious possibility of 
this magazine being reborn with the new menu shell in place.. 
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, an insanely hyper one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 9 (mid 1995).
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Deadish but with prospects of revival.
 Language: English.

Falk Mag

 A French Falcon only effort about which I know v. little. From 
the source I've got, it seems to be favourably received, with a 
good custom menu shell along the lines of the better diskmags, 
and a wide and varied range of articles, from programming, 
through to various reviews, technical features, and more general 
slant on such things as multimedia (music/film etc) coverage. 
Probably French language only.. (Source: Toxic Mag issue 12)
 Status: Public domain/Shareware?
 User Interface: Apparently, a reasonable custom one.
 Latest known issue: 3 (mid 1996)
 Address: Alexandre Garcia, Falk Mag, Averanede, 31390
 Marquefave. France.
 Health: Alive. 
 Language: Probably French.
 
F.A.S.T.E.R.

 The magazine that started everything with regard to a neat user 
interface - one of the very earliest ST disk magazines, having 
started somewhere in the autumn of 1986. It was Canadian of 
origin, and I seem to recall that some of the earliest issues had 
a set of English articles and their copies in French. Later 
issues were English only. They were the first that had a user 
interface, and they survived only a bit more than a year - 
probably because they were commercial, which tends to make things 
more complicated than they need be . Last known issue was Volume 
2 Issue 4, and I'm pretty sure that's the final one too.
 The "F.A.S.T.E.R." user group still lives on, so it seems.
 Status: Commercial.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one (the first one).
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 4.
 Address: No longer relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: Used to be French and English. Later issues were only
 in English.

Focus Diskmag

An educational diskmag which appeared in early 1996 with its 
sights set very much on a wider point of view than the computer 
scene. It obtained its sources from the Internet, seeking to 
enlighten people on many diverse topics. It was issued by Graham 
Sykes of Locutus PDL, but not for long as it only lasted a couple 
or so issues.
 Status: PD/Freeware.
 User Interface: A fairly basic STOS one.
 Latest known issue: 2 (early 1996).
 Address: N/A.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.

FUN (See 'DBA')

An unofficial revival of the defunct DBA mag.. 'Fun' is a general 
banner for Dutch Falcon activities in the latter part of 1996, of 
which the magazine is only a part. 'Fun 1.5' is to take the place 
of the former DBA issue 15, and should be due shortly. There is a 
question mark as to whether there will be any more issues after 
this one.
 Status: PD/Freeware.
 User Interface: The inspirational DBA Falcon menu.
 Latest Known Issue: 1.5 (due soon)
 Address: Alexander de Vries, Paul Krugerstraat 38,
 8331 SK Steenwijk, The Netherlands
 Health: Reborn, if only for a short time?
 Language: Primarily English, with some Dutch?
 
G.D.I.

 A Spanish true multi-format (ST/Amiga/PC) magazine, primarily 
written in Spanish, too, but with some articles in English. It 
works on any ST/TT/Falcon, actually, including multi-tasking 
operating systems. It uses a kind of "hypertext" interface where 
you can click on indices causing sublists and, eventually, 
articles to be loaded. Actual content cannot quality can't be 
judged due to limited understanding of Spanish in yours truly. 
The first issue was released on March 12th 1994.
 G.D.I. stands for Grupo de Desarrollo Informatico, by the bye.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 2.
 Address: Email gdi@dtc.uvigo.es or gdi@ait.uvigo.es.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Spanish, with some wee bits of English.
 
GEnieLamp Atari ST 

 This is the resource magazine covering the Genie (BBS system) ST 
RoundTable. It offers all information that could otherwise be 
found on Genie, comprising an enormous amount of up-to-date 
information. It is released monthly (on the 1st of each month) in 
ASCII format, but a special version is available for the TX2 
reader software (featuring graphics). The first issue was 
published in June 1990. There have been a few months in its 
existence in which two issues have been released. It is published 
by T/TalkNET, and the editor is Sheldon (previously Bruce 
Faulkner). There are "GEnieLamp" magazines covering Amiga, PC and 
MacIntosh as well.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: No.
 Latest known issue: Issue 84 (September 1995).
 Address: Email gelamp.st@genie.geis.com.
 
How to Code

 A virtually Falcon-specific coding magazine, really hot on the 
heels of the latest programming tricks with regard to DSP, MPEG 
playing, GIF display and all that stuff. Of limited appeal to the 
layman, of course, but all the more interesting for Those Who Are 
In The Know. The articles come in French and English. It has 
official distributors around the globe (it is shareware), which 
will not be listed here, though. It is done by members of EKO, 
really famous French Falcon demo programmers.
 Status: Shareware (costs 50 French Francs, and to give you an
 idea of what that is, the UK distributor asks ú7.50).
 User interface: A neat custom one. There's one for the Falcon
 and one GEM-friendly one that'll work as ACC or PRG.
 Latest known issue: Issue 3 (summer 1995 or thereabouts).
 Address: Alexis Naibo, 63 Rue des Cigognes, F-31520, Ramonville,
 France.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: French and English.
 
HP Source
 
 A disk magazine that (also) payed attention to STOS programming, 
the successor to "STOS Bits" (Cf.). It also payed attention to 
"GfA Basic" and assembler, and had a much neater user interface 
than its predecessor. The editor, Leon O'Reilly, decided to call 
it quits after issue 2 as he considered it wasn't perfect enough. 
Rumours have it that it was intended as sortof an undead "Maggie" 
(Cf.) but "Maggie" suddenly went undead all on its own so there.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 2 (released at Ripped Off Convention
 1992).
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
ICTARI

 According to an ad I read somewhere: "Are you an Atari 
programmer? It does not matter which language you use, whether it 
be STOS, assembler, C, or whatever takes your fancy, you nee 
ICTARI, the Atari ST Programmer's Disk Magazine." Features 
sources and ideas for novices and experts alike. An issue is 
released on every 15th of the month, which I think is quite a 
feat. I've got no hands-on experience, but it's supposed to be 
quite good. The disk magazine is a publication of the "The ICTARI 
programmer's user group", which started in March 1993. Except for 
a small gap in 1993 - when the editor was changed - the mag has 
been released regularly. The group's membership is free; all you 
pay is the postage for the issues that get sent to you, and send 
them the disks for it.
 Status: Public Domain, sortof.
 User interface: No. Just use the desktop or a text displayer.
 Latest known issue: Issue 26 (September 15th 1995).
 Address: ICTARI, The ATARI Programmer's User Group, c/o Peter
 Hibbs, 63 Woolsbridge Road, Ringwood, Hants., BH24 2LX,
 England.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
Inc Magazine

 A disk mag offered by the Incoders, a demo crew from Sweden. 
Made by a bunch of real enthusiasts, but once said (I quote) to 
have "the effect of a bunch of schoolkids leaping up and down" 
(source: "STEN" disk magazine roundup). Articles were short and 
its appeal was limited. One of its writers, one Mr. Cool, went on 
to "DBA Magazine" after "Inc Magazine" folded.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a custom one.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Indy Magazine

 In mid 1994, the latest hot thing, presumably with monthly 
intent. Little is known about it, however, at current, other than 
that it is released by a union of German crews calling themselves 
Independent (some 70 people in total, with some excellent 
graphics persons).
 Further information suggests that this was in fact an internal 
publication solely for the membership of the Independent, and not 
made available to outsiders! 

 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Probably yes.
 Latest known issue: Rumoured issue 4.
 Address: Unknown.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Most likely to be German.
 
Inside Info 
 
 A bi-monthly disk magazine published by the New South Wales 
section of "ACE" (Atari Computer Enthusiasts). It's basically a 
magazine for members, so it includes meeting minutes and stuff 
like that. Looks OK, especially if you want to stay in touch with 
Ñdown under. Has a good shell, but you have to wade through a bit 
too much before you can get down to the actual reading.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, the "Infodisk" shell.
 Latest known issue: Issue 76 (summer 1995).
 Address: 20 Blairgourie Circuit, St. Andrews, NSW 2556,
 Australia.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
InSoft Disk Newsletter

 A US disk magazine. Nothing is known about the amount of issues 
that have appeared, and not even if the only issue of which 
notice was made (an August 1986 one) was indeed the first one.
 Status: Probably Public Domain.
 User interface: Probably. Not certainly.
 Latest known issue: Not known.
 Address: Irrelevant.
 Health: Dead and decomposing.
 Language: English. 
 
Interleave

 A rather excellent disk magazine with literary tendencies that, 
unfortunately, folded after two cult issues that appeared in 
1991. Its editor was Tom Zunder, who filled the mag with 
"software, music, films and sex". What more would one want? Tom 
continued writing for "STEN" (Cf.) and "ST NEWS" (Cf.) for a 
while, but was never heard of afterwards.
 Status: Licenceware.
 User interface: The S.A.N.D. shell.
 Latest known issue: Number 2.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English. 
 
Jag!â
 
 "Jag!" is an on-line Jaguar-dedicated magazine in German. I am 
not sure when it started exactly, but probably around the end of 
1993 or in January 1994. Half of it is about Jaguar game reviews 
and all kinds of interesting stuff, the other half consists of 
advertisements. It's released every two weeks, and its editor is 
Carsten Nipkow.
 Status: Public Domain, on-line.
 User interface: None.
 Latest known issue: 3/94 (February 1994).
 Address: An der Ruthe 9, D-58791 Werdohl, Germany.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: German.

Kelstar

This is a comparatively new magazine started up by Bob Kell, with 
a broad humour/general topics theme, and it lightly touches on 
computing matters as well. It also has had the distinction of 
being panned by ST Format, shortly before *they* went down the 
pan, for the adult nature of some of their contents. It is 
distributed with a '16' certificate. Articles vary widely in 
nature and quality, with a lively letters section. The shell is 
the widely used TOMS system, but a custom shell authored by Tony 
Greenwood is on its way, and should be ready in time for issue 
six.
 Status: Public Domain, '16' certificate.
 User Interface: TOMS shell, but a custom one from issue 6.
 Latest known issue: Issue 6 (December 1996)
 Address: 22 March Crescent, Cellardyke, Fife KY10 3AE. (UK!)
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English, with distinct touches of Scottishness! 
 
Lavarush

 Unfortunately not much is known about this disk magazine, as I 
only found Ñhalf an ad of it (in the now long defunct English 
"Zero" glossy magazine), of which I'll share the text with you: 
"Lavarush, new ST diskzine for everyone with computer reviews, 
features, music, films,"...
 And, indeed, that's where it stopped. More info seriously 
needed.
 
Ledgers Magazine 
 
 This was the demo group "Untouchables" disk magazine. It was 
very enthusiastic and full of humour (and indeed, seemed to 
consist primarily of it). Featured short articles, but Ñmany of 
them. One of the better and definitely one of the most zany disk 
magazines around. Their user interface used to be a GEM pull-down 
menu but later became a mega-demo-like playfield with selectable 
bunches of articles as opposed to demo screens. The editor and 
chief coder was Matt Sullivan. Neat intros. Colour only. They 
seemed to appear about every month, which was quite a feat!
 Status: Used to be licenceware, but shareware as of issue 9.
 Costs ú3.
 User interface: Yes. A fully custom one. It differs per issue.
 Latest known issue: Issue 13 (September 1992).
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead. Sometimes there's a Ñtiny rumour of life, though,
 no matter how ill-placed, for they are truly deceased.
 Language: English.
 
Leic ST

 This is a magazine that I have no personal experience with, but 
it's said to be extremely crap; basically about 5 Kb of text with 
the rest of the disk filled with PD. It appears to be monthly, 
though this is not certain, and doesn't really classify as a disk 
magazine actually.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, the "ST Zine" PD one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 26.
 Address: Not known.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.
 
Maggie (Hem Hem!)

 Having started in June 1990, "Maggie" (or "Disk Maggie") quickly 
became one of the very best ST disk magazines. It was initiated 
by the British Lost Boys and at the time almost entirely written 
by Michael Schussler (a German guy living in England). As of 
issue 8, when Michael joined the Delta Force, they became 
unbelievably much better, with a totally slick menu, much better 
music, picture and a fast page viewer. A quality turnpoint came 
in 1993 when, with the release of issue 11, "Maggie" turned out 
to have been taken over by some British guys lead by the editor, 
Chris "CIH" Holland. All the good bits previously present were 
now complemented with much better writing, a healthy dose of 
enthusiasm and, lacking completely before that, Ñwit. It also 
worked on the Falcon, though with the lustrum issue of August 
1995 (issue 18) they started releasing separate disks for ST 
(with the old shell and ST goodies) and Falcon (HD disk with 
fancy mod, more colours and Falcon goodies). The Falcon shell was 
coded by the talented Reservoir Gods.
 "Maggie" tries (though fails) to be bi-monthly. Remarkably, it 
works on colour as well as monochrome. 
 After Issue 16, a special "Maggie's Guide to Classic Consoles" 
issue was released. Although done with the "Maggie" ST shell 
(kind thanks to Chris), it has nothing further to do with 
"Maggie" at all, and was done by Reservoir Gods. Nice for old 
console freaks, though (as in Colecovision, Vectrex, Atari 2600 
and the like).
 The end of 1995 also saw the release of the long-delayed 
compilation issue, 'The best of issues 1 to 11' using the old 
style Delta Force shell.. Another compilation to take things to 
issue 20 is also planned..
 Issue 21 also saw the start of a revamp to the ST version of the 
menu shell, with several crucial differences and improvements to 
the layout from before, and with more planned for the future.
 Status: Licenceware (up to and including issue 10), Public
 Domain (later issues).
 User interface: Yes. Crap up to 7, after that really nice and
 custom. Separate user interfaces for ST and Falcon as of issue
 18.
 Latest known issue: Number 21 (Sept 28th 1996).
 Address: 26 Robinson Road, Rushden, Northants NN10 0EH, UK.
 Health: Very Alive.
 Language: Previously (<issue 11) English with some German, now
 only English.
 
Magnum

 A Polish disk magazine made by the group Illusions (or Warriors 
of Darkness; maybe they have several names). The first issue, "0" 
promotion issue, was released around May/June of 1992. Its 
articles were rather short and few, displayed in 40-column mode. 
Only colour monitors were supported. It had a custom user 
interface where the cursor keys lead you through the various 
options and the space bar selected them. You had several menu 
screens. The music was in tracker .MOD format, and was quite 
excellent. There were several modules in each issue.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: A custom one. Not too excellent, not too bad
 either.
 Latest known issue: Issue 3 (fourth issue, November/December
 1992)
 Address: No longer relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: Polish. 
 
Massive Mag

 A Finnish disk magazine with a demo'n'hacking atmosphere. Nice 
music (some of it ripped), nice demos, nice graphics. Quite a lot 
of stuff was offered, among which also quite a load of articles. 
The editor was Claff Moron of the Admirables. It died around the 
middle of 1994.
 In earlier versions of this disk magazine roundup it was also 
called "Admirabels Mag". That magazine actually never existed, 
and was "Massive Mag" actually.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one. Quite slow.
 Latest known issue: Number 4. Issue 5 was made but never
 released.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
MAST Newsdisk

 In 1988, ex-US distributor of "ST NEWS" (Cf.) David Meile 
started his own disk magazine with the MAST user group ("MAST" 
was "Massuchusetts Atari ST" user group). It was called "MAST 
Newsdisk", of which only two issues are known to have been 
released (the last one in April 1988). It used the "Newsdisk" 
shell program. After this magazine sortof ceased, suddenly 
nothing was heard of David (he got married somewhere, I believe) 
and "ST NEWS" had to look for another US distribution channel.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. The "Newsdisk" shell.
 Latest known issue: Number 2.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
NASA Mag

 This disk magazine, of which little is known except for the 
fact that at least one issue appeared, and that it is written in 
French and English. It might be dead, it might be alive. More 
information required.
 
News Channel 

 A fellow Dutch disk magazine that arose somewhere in 1987 and 
survived a bit over 1 year. Somewhat notorious for its mainly 
polemic battle with ÅST NEWS - mainly concerning them using their 
authors, their music and their foreign distributor network.
 For a while, some of the people behind "News Channel" seemed 
to be getting back in the picture with "STabloid" (Cf.).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one.
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 1.
 Address: No longer relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
News Flash

 This is a disk magazine "in utero", as Nirvanians would have it. 
The first issue is/was planned for autumn 1995, so we'll just see 
what comes of it. It's made by the crew Flash, from Finland. The 
main head editor honcho seems to be Juha Vihriala.
 Status: Public domain.
 User interface: It's bound to have a custom one.
 Latest known issue: None yet.
 Address: Eljaksentie 6, 62800 Vimpeli, Finland.
 Health: In utero, most likely.
 Language: English?
 Remark: "Eljaksentie" means "Road where moose cross".
 
Nova

 "Nova" is an Atari ST disk magazine, non-profit, released for 
the first time around spring of 1994. It's dedicated to 
"Trekkies", i.e. fans of the "Star Trek" films/series and stuff 
like that. The latest issue can be obtained by sending a disk and 
one pound plus SAE (or IRCs if you live outside England) to James 
Bird (who is the editor) at the below address.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Unknown/custom one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 8.
 Address: 91 Elm tree Avenue, Kilburn, Belper, Derby, DE56 0NN, 
 England.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: English.
 
ON-Disk

 A British disk magazine by Paul Wilson. Last known issue was 
number 3, that appeared spring 1988. The program had quite an 
unintuitive and buggy user interface, but the editorial contents 
were OK.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A custom one that was not too good.
 Latest known issue: Not certain, but probably number 3.
 Address: Not relevant.
 Health: Dead.
 Language: English.
 
Power Disk Magazine 

 Started as a monthly (!) shareware disk magazine run by James L. 
Mathews (who is very young, 13 at the start of the magazine early 
1993). It uses a STOS-based shell, I believe, and it is supposed 
to work on any TOS 1.xx, though not on that of the Falcon. 
Although the editorial staff thinks highly of itself and its 
efforts, it's just another good disk magazine really. At start it 
has a lot (like, 100) articles that were very small (like, 3.5 Kb 
on average), but articles are getting less and longer. As of 
issue 23, texts are stored compressed and the user interface has 
been overhauled. As of that issue, mono compatibility was 
provided, though Falcon compatibility still seems a long way off. 
Around issue 25 it became bi-monthly.
 It has changed status a few times and is currently shareware. 
Registering will award you with a password that will give access 
to competition entry, bonus prizes and discounts at Power PD.
 Since May 1995, nothing more has been heard from James Mathews, 
even with respect to his other activities, and we must assume 
that the magazine has passed away.
 Status: Public Domain from issues 1 to 7. Power Licenceware from
 issue 8 to 15 (costs ú2.50 per issue including disk and p&p).
 Shareware as of issue 16 of May 1994 (ú1 to ú1.50 registration
 fee to cover running costs).
 User interface: Yes, an OK but rather slow STOS one.
 Latest known issue: Issue 26 (May 1995).
 Address: Not applicable now.
 Health: Dead(ish).
 Language: English.
 
Pure Bollocks

 A strictly underground magazine, with rather controversial 
contents. Articles are peppered with obscenities (and the demos 
with naughty piccies), and it's very coder-oriented. Among 
others, this magazine features "how to" articles on cracking 
digital locks, hacking answerphones and American Pirate BBS phone 
numbers. Lots of it comes from various sources "on the net". It's 
Scottish, and started with Issue 21, January 17th 1993. Spring 
1995 saw them recoding their shell for future use.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, a very flashy smooth one. Very original.
 Latest known issue: Issue 23 (September 18th 1993).
 Address: P.O. Box 1083, Glasgow G14 9DG, Scotland, UK. A support
 page on the WWW is http://www.gla.ac.uk/~895822ja/pb/.
 Health: Alive, but being reprogrammed and lacking writers so, in
 their words, "alive but a little sleepy" (which might be a most
 tremendous understatement).
 Language: English.
 
Quantum Underground Anarchic Reading Konspiracy (QUARK)

 An English disk magazine available on ST, Amiga, PC and Amstrad 
CPC formats. Basically it's made by Pete Binsley and two friends 
across these formats. Concentrates on fiction only, but has a 
user interface. Quite small - their debut issue took up only 150 
Kb in space (the program plus about two dozen uncompressed short 
stories and the like).
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes. A rather basic one.
 Latest known issue: One (September 1992).
 Address: 52 Avis Road, Denton, Newhaven, East Sussex BN9 0PN,
 England.
 Health: Alive?
 Language: English.
 
Quast

 A Polish disk magazine put together by the Quast group, in 
Poland. Nothing much is known about it, other than that it 
exists.
 Status: Not known.
 User interface: Not known.
 Latest known issue: Not known, but one should guess at least 1.
 Address: Ul. Niecala 3, 89-100 Naklo.
 Health: Alive.
 Language: Not known.
 Remark: The 'l' in Niecala and Naklo is actually no 'l', but an
 'l' with a capital 'L' written across it with the vertical bit
 slanted to the right, so 'l' and Ñ'L' written on top of each
 other. That's Polish for you!

RTS Track

 A smoothly looking disk magazine from the Netherlands. The first 
three issues (all released in 1992) were in Dutch, but after 
that it switched to English. Like "Maggie" and "DBA" (Cf.) it's 
fairly demo-oriented, although the crew that makes it stresses 
not to be a demo crew. This is possible caused by the main menu 
appearance: A bit like a megademo but still managable. About 40 
were present in Volume 2 Issue 1, some of which contained 
graphics as well (medium resolution text with low resolution 
pictures - pretty slick!). Issue 2.1 came on two disks, the 
second one containing a load of shareware utilities also written 
by RTS, the crew that releases the magazine. The editor was Ferdy 
Blaset. The 2.1 program was not fully Falcon compatible but you 
can get access to everything but the intro, and the low res pics 
in the text flicker a bit.
 After Volume 2 Issue 1 the editor's ST broke down and lack of 
funds and support for "RTS Track" have caused the magazine to 
cease publication.
 Status: Public Domain.
 User interface: Yes, quite an excellent one.
 Latest known issue: Volume 2 Issue 1.
 Address: Halleyweg 114, NL-3318 CP, Dordrecht, Netherlands.
 Health: Comatose, most likely dead.
 Language: Used to be Dutch (Volume 1), after that English.Å
