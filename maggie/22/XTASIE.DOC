                              XTASIE DEMO
                                BY TRIO 
#######################################################################
The Xtasie demo was released at the recent  "The Place To Be 4" party. 
Its dodgy title, though seems to link it more  closely  with  the early 
90s. In fact, last time I was in France a  couple  tried  to  score  
ecstasy  off me. But that is a different story...

On loading the demo you are presented  with a videl correction screen. 
Some text with a large white border asks you to  "move the mouse to 
centre the screen". In this way you can make sure that all effects 
appear at exactly the right place on your monitor. Unfortunately, the 
videl  routines  seem slightly buggered and the screen is on an endless 
vertical scroll which is rather disconcerting.

Having centred the screen as best as you  can you are presented with 
the Windows 95 opening screen, complete with the  colour  cycling  bars  
at the bottom. As I have to spend every  day  at  work  using  these  
horrible machines, seeing this screen on my Falcon was not a pleasant 
sight!

The demo finishes loading and we are  into the opening credits screen. 
Trio seem to have got some help  from  a  team  called  "TMX 
Productions" in creating this demo. Next up pops xtasie logo which is 
nicely designed.

The music which plays throughout  is  reasonably  good  -  driven  by a 
high bpm drumbeat accompanied by some pleasant voxxy noises.

It is now time for the obligatory  gouraud  shading screen. This 
features a cube in shades of blue, and does have  a  background which 
features a picture of some other 3D objects. Competent.

"Set me free/I'm in ecstasy/I'm so  high/reach  for  the  sky" ran the 
lyrics to _every_ rave tune ever released. The Xtasie  demo decides to 
"reach for the sky" with a starfield. No  special  effects,  no  
planets  popping  up, no 3D objects lurking behind a distant galaxy, 
just  a  starfield,  rather like the one behind this text.

Next there is not a bad effort at  the  tunnel effect, with a super 
imposed trio logo. Unfortunately for Trio, the trio  of  tunnel  
effects on the Joint Venture demo urinate over this one from a great 
height. Oh well.

It's a fire effect, Jim, but not  as  we  know  it. Oh dear, a rather 
disastrous fire effect. We are already pretty sick  of  this effect, 
and we have formed the opinion that the fire  on  the  Spirits  4Ktro  
cannot  be  beaten. This fire is amongst the worst seen on the Falcon. 
Not too hot.

Next up - a texture mapped  cube.  This  is  actually  quite well done 
and moves about reasonably well. The graphics featured are  images of 
naked manga babes so the "PC brigade" will not be happy.  It  would  
have  been nice if they had been slightly more  ambitious  with  their  
texture  mapping  routine,  tried  to  do something a bit new rather 
than just the tried and tested 3D cube.

Oh dear! Its a rotating zoomer  with  a  rather lurid green background! 
And some white text over it in one of the  worst  fonts know to man. 
This basically forms the greeting screen with  crew  names  being  
superimposed  on  the texture with rotates and zooms up to fill the 
screen.  There is then a nasty pause whilst the next crew name is drawn 
on the texture  and the procedure continues. This is not a bad idea, 
using a rot-zoom for  greetings,  but  not much effort has gone into 
it. If each crew had their own  separate  piece of graphics it would 
have worked much better and added more variety to the demo.

Next up is the interpolative texture  mapping.  We know this because it 
displays the legend across the screen in another appaling font. The 
interpolative texture mapping itself is, as you would expect, very  
slow. And prone to errors - random lines sometimes appear across the 
polygon  faces. Overall, a badly presented and slow effect, but at 
least they were attempting something different.

One of my favourite bits appears next, OK so it's only a little 
animation but at least it looks nice. The text  TRIO  appears  and  the 
letters split and fly off forming the words aTaRI falcOn 030. Cool.

The credits screen appears. At  least  it  isn't  a  vertical scroller, 
but then again its just a static screen with some very plain text.

Finally the demo ends with the Windows  95  close down screens, which 
anyone who has had the misfortune to use the  appaling  excuse for an 
operating system will be all too familiar with. The text  for  "please 
wait whilst your computer shuts down" etc. is all in French, but sadly  
the program itself is not called Fenetre 95.

Like Windows 95, this demo leaves a  bit  of  a  sour taste in the 
mouth. Simply listing the effects gives an indication of  the poverty 
of imagination that went into this demo - gouraud, starfield,  tunnel 
effect, fire, texture mapping, rot- zoom. Only the interpolative 
texture  mapping  betrayed any signs of innovation, and unfortunately 
this was one of the worst screens.

The demo looks like it has been  rushed  together to be completed for 
"The Place To Be" party, and it does  seem  fairly  unfinished  in  
places. Its a shame the video routines don't actually work - the first 
couple of times I loaded the demo it worked fine, but now it just rolls 
the screen. Other people I know have never got it to work.

The Windows 95 screens add some well needed humour to the demo and it 
is obvious that the people who made this demo  have  some  talent, they 
just need to get it together on the design and ideas side and we may be 
able to look forward to some interesting releases from them in 97.
