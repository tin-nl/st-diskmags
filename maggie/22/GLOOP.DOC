Ö Gloop Demo!
by
ÅMisfits

This one had its first public appearance at the Birmingham Atari Show 
when Leon popped it unexpectedly onto my hard drive.. Even then, it was 
quite a nice little demo, although we only seemed to get half  
soundtrack due to a faulty connecting lead to the speakers..
Å
Not unnaturally, it gets its turn for review in an issue largely 
dominated by French productions..

Gloop is another recent demo that falls firmly into the 'design' school 
as made famous by a thousand French coders before them.. This is 
definitely a 'good looks first, whizz coding second' production, 
although what they do with the Falcon from a metal bashing point of 
view  is not too bad either.. 

Demo starts up, and a jolly, jaunty, boppy sort of soundtrack that you 
will either love to bits, or burn the composer in hell for, fades in to 
a swirling lively 3-D starfield.. Whatever the musical merits, or not, 
of the audio, it certainly fits the intended mood of the demo 
perfectly.. Anyway, back to the starfield, and it certainly is spinning 
around all over the place and keen to let the next effect get on, which 
is a circles spinning in a lightsourced fashion in a manner seen in a 
DNT demo reviewed about a couple of years ago.. "Too slow, but nice 
looking" as Arto might have once said!!

Some squiggly ST-inspired spirograph patterns are next, as these bounce 
up and down.. A little turtle then appears, and grows to fill the whole 
screen, and what has happened is that a fancy new way of screen 
clearing has been devised as the texture left by the 'turtle' now fills 
up the whole screen as a handy background, and some dot-spline globular 
objects wriggle onto the screen..

A window does a nice fancy fade in to the left hand side, and the first 
serious effect of the day comes into play.. This is a bijou (this one 
word of the month!) version of ye olde zoom and rotate, but it is with 
us for a brief moment only before Misfits decide to take things on a 
bit further..

They do a take-off of Exa, particularly a teddy bear related drawing by 
Flan, which is *not* called Ripley! This sits on the left hand side, 
and acts as the 'design' element of the forthcoming bits of the demo..   

Another window pops in on the right, and this is where the remaining 
effects take place.. A rather nice polygon with multiple spinning 
textures mapped onto each face of the object is there for a little 
while.. 

The inevitable doughnut is in there next, as it is subjected to a 
ferocious asssault by a variety of effects and textures.. Initially we 
get a pineapple slice efect with some gold/yellow shading effects.. 
Then, it slows to a crawl to take on some kind of environment mapping 
that makes it look a bit more like bananas were involved in surface 
texturing the object.. Some colourshock type shading follows on from 
that, with the Falcon racking its silicon brains for some of the lesser 
known deeper shades of purply-blue..

A change in mood with a fiery vector cube spinning over a lake of fire, 
or something.. Another old effect, but again, works very slickly within 
the confines of its onscreen prison as the cube zooms right into the 
screen, and out again.. 

Finally, out of this series of effects, a double helix type 3-D dot 
spline object spins around on screen.. Quite a nice multicoloured 
effect too..

The screen fades, not a normal fade, but a 'spotlight' effect as the 
displayed area grows smaller and smaller, then it is gone altogether.. 
A change of music to a similar jaunty happy boppy tune later, and we 
are onto the end credits, which include a little effect in with the 
functional upward scrolling text.. This is a constantly mutating 3D bob 
shiny plastic look 'molecule' which floats around the screen as the 
text does its thing..
  


TECH VIEW: A very neat demo this, with a good deal going on beneath 
the surface than the (very clean) design suggests.

The DSP is used only for the music, so the 3D is not cutting edge, but 
the ideas are new: using the phong shading technique twice, but 
altering the texture used in the r/g/b split section for a neat twist. 
It's just a shame the objects aren't a bit bigger, faster or more 
original.

Most of the other effects are copies of other older demos, but it's 
all well coded. A decent Amiga style demo - something the Falcon 
really isn't suited to. [tat]


ÅRatings..

Graphix:- 85% - Very good on presentation, a little bit of original 
hand-drawn material as well..

ÅSonix:- 78% or 8% - Depending on your point of view.. Do not judge the 
music until you've heard it though..

ÅGee-Whiz:- 70% - Not a lot new doing here.. Back to the presentation 
skills being the soul and essence of the demo I guess..
Å
Overall:- 81% - Almost a classic cliche 'design' school demo..
