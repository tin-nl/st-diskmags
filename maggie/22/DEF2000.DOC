DEFENDER 2000

After a wait of however many years, waiting for this legendary 
game from the equally legendary Jeff Minter, it's finally here !!

Defender 2000 was one of the hotly awaited new games for the Jag 
- the fact that many High Street stores started to drop it just 
as things were looking rosier in general for Atari's console 
didn't help as far as the general availability went.

The original Defender game, from the arcades of yesteryear, back 
in the days when both this and PacMan were the leaders in the 
arcade game stakes, back in the heady days of the 1970's.

On booting up, we are presented with a choice of 3 versions of 
Defender; the classic version, a version called 'Defender Plus', 
with, finally, the updated version as written by Jeff Minter.  In 
fact, all versions were written by Jeff, and he certainly did a 
good job on each of them.

The classic version of the game is just like the original arcade 
version, consisting of a black background with single-colour 
sprites, ships and people to rescue.  The Plus version is a 
little more advanced, with multi-coloured enemies and ships, 
while the '2000' version contains a fantastic background, 
together with superbly animated prisoners to rescue and enemies 
to blast into the sunset.  If any of you have played the earlier 
Falcon game by Jeff, Llamazap, you will have some idea of what I 
mean here.

Jeff Minter has a reputation for creating fantastic games with 
exellent graphics and gameplay; Defender 2000 is no exception to 
this rule.  It is a shame that Jeff is no longer developing on 
the Jag, or on any Atari system for that matter at the moment.  
Hopefully we'll hear something new from him soon ...

Playability - 99%

Graphics - 95%  (the classic versions are exactly like the 
original)

Sonix - 95%

„CiH bolt-on viewpoint..
„
 Hmmm, Felice didn't really go into a lot of detail here, but 
I've had a go, and can say that the '2000' version is 
interesting, but I've also got some reservations..

Visually, 'D2K' seems to be an uneasy balance between what Jeff 
Minter would want to do with it, and Atari insisting on it 
looking more 'mainstream'.. The inbetween bits seem to have the 
most Minteresque influences, with the plasma effects and 'melt-o-
vision' influences carried on from Tempest 2000.. The main game 
graphics are drawn by someone else, and don't look too bad, even 
if the backgrounds are a little subdued..  The game as a whole, 
could do with a little more lighting.. You ship is a little 
oversized, the bad guys about average, and the humanoids, on the 
ground comically animated..

D2K uses a combination of unmemorable soundtracks and many of the 
original sound effects from the arcade original.. They should 
have hired the guy who did the soundtracks on the Falcon epic 
'Llamazap', as those tunes were brilliant..

Playability, always a tough one to get right, and on a Defender 
game, has to be absolutely spot on.. Unfortunately, Jeff went for 
as much speed as he could crank out of the Jag, and the overall 
feeling is one of trying to stop a car on a downhill stretch of 
icy road.. Memory serves me to the point of telling me that the 
original arcade game was a lot like that as well.. Memory also 
tells me that the arcade game could be mastered after some effort 
„from the player, but with D2K, I'm not so sure..

Defender can be spoiled by over-embellishment, and that is where 
this game has gone wrong.. You get some odd combination moves, 
such as the one where you are suddenly flying backwards, but 
you're still shooting in the direction you were previously 
travelling.. **Not** a feature of classic Defender, and one 
likely to get you into trouble if you rely on your classic 
Defender instincts.. The situation regarding weapons power-ups 
seems to be a bit over the top as well, and you end up with a 
ship that has more in common with a Japanese console style turbo-
nutter death machine found in hundreds of R-Type clones written 
down the ages.. Defender, it 'aint though.. We won't go into 
detail about skidding around the screen and crashing into the bad 
guys, but to be fair, this was a large part of the original as 
well.. 

As an attempt to redress the balance, a sort of 'AI Droid' is 
provided who rushes around the screen nobbling any bad guys he 
can get hold of.. It helps, but also contributes to the feeling 
that you are not completely in charge of events, and suggests 
that you might as well shut your eyes, charge around, and hold 
down the fire button for roughly the same end result as if you 
tried to play it properly..

Also in its favour, is the 'three in one' approach, where you get 
a classic and intermediate version of 'Defender, which adds to 
the value of the cartridge.. Also, I'm sure it is possible to get 
used to the game to a greater extent, but it somehow misses the 
spot so superbly hit by the original article..

I would have to disagree with Felice on his assessment, and would 
give it 75% - possibly rising to 80%..
