          The Next Generation The Lost Script: First Contract
                     <Maggie version by TaFf>

[Picard]
"Mr.LaForge, have you had any success  with your attempts at finding a
weakness in the Borg? And Mr.Data, have  you been able to access their
command pathways?"

[Geordi]
"Yes, Captain. In fact, we found  the  answer by searching through our
archives on late Twentieth-century computer technology."

[Geordi presses a key, and a logo appears on the computer screen.]

[Riker looks puzzled]
"What the hell is 'Microsoft'?"

[Data turns to answer]
"Allow me to explain.  We  will  send  this  program,  for some reason
called 'Windows', through the Borg command pathways. Once inside their
root command unit, it  will  begin  consuming  system  resources at an
unstoppable rate."

[Picard]
"But the Borg  have  the  ability  to  adapt.  Won't  they alter their
processing systems to increase their storage capacity?"

[Data]
"Yes, Captain. But  when  'Windows'  detects  this,  it  creates a new
version of  itself  known  as  an  'upgrade'.  The  use  of  resources
increases exponentially with each iteration. The Borg will not be able
to adapt quickly enough.  Eventually  all  of their processing ability
will be taken  over  and  none  will  be  available  for  their normal
operational functions."

[Picard]
"Excellent work. This is even  better  than that 'unsolvable geometric
shape' idea."

[Data]
"Captain, we have succesfully installed  'Windows' in the command unit
and as we expected it  immediately  consumed  85% of all resources. We
however have not received any confirmation of the expected 'upgrade'."

[Geordi]
"Our scanners have picked  up  an  increase  in  Borg  storage and CPU
capacity to  compensate,  but  we  still  have  no  indication  of  an
'upgrade' to compensate for their increase."

[Picard]
"Data, scan  the  history  banks  again  and  determine  if  there  is
something we have missed."

[Data]
"Sir, I believe there is a  reason  for  the failure in the 'upgrade'.
Apparently the Borg have circumvented  that  part  of  the plan by not
sending in their registration cards."

[Riker]
"Captain, we have no choice.  Requesting permission to begin emergency
escape sequence 3F..."

[Geordi, excited]
"Wait, I just detected their CPU  capacity  has suddenly dropped to 0%
!"

[Picard]
"Data, what does your scanner show ?"

[Data]
"Apparently the Borg have  found  the  internal 'windows' module named
'Solitaire' and it has used up all its CPU capacity."

[Picard]
"Lets wait  and  see  how  long  this  'solitaire'  can  reduce  their
functionality."

[Riker]
"Geordi, what is the status of the Borg ?"

[Geordi]
"As expected, the Borg are attempting to re-engineer to compensate for
increased CPU and storage  demands,  but  each  time they successfully
resource  I have set  up  our  closest  deep  space  monitor beacon to
transmit more 'windows' modules  from  something called the 'Microsoft
fun-pack'."

[Picard]
"How much time will that buy us ?"

[Data]
"Current Borg solution rates allow  me  to  predicate an interest time
span of 6 more hours."

[Geordi]
"Captain, another vessel has entered our sector."

[Picard]
"Identify."

[Data]
"It appears to have markings very similar to the 'Microsoft' logo."

[Over the speakers]
"THIS IS ADMIRAL BILL  GATES  OF  THE  MICROSOFT FLAGSHIP MONOPOLY. WE
HAVE POSITIVE CONFIRMATION OF  UNREGISTERED  SOFTWARE  IN THIS SECTOR.
SURRENDER ALL ASSETS  AND  WE  CAN  AVOID  ANY  TROUBLE.  YOU  HAVE 10
SECONDS."

[Data]
"The alien ship just opened its forward hatches and released thousands
of humanoid shaped objects."

[Picard]
"Magnify forward viewer on the alien craft."

[Riker]
"Good God, Captain! Those are humans floating straight toward the Borg
ship with no life support suits ! How can they survive the tortures of
deep space ?!"

[Data]
"I don't believe that those are humans  sir, if you will look closer I
believe you will see that  they  are  carrying something recognized by
twenty-first century man as doe  skin  leather briefcases, and wearing
Armani suits."

[Riker and Picard together, horrified]
"Lawyers !!"

Geordi]
"It can't be. All the Lawyers were  rounded  up and sent hurtling into
the sun in 2017 during the Great Awakening."

[Data]
"True, but apparently some must have survived."

[Riker]
"They have surrounded the Borg ship and are covering it with all types
 of papers."

[Data]
"I believe that is known in ancient  venacular as 'red tape', it often
proves fatal."

[Riker]
"They're tearing the Borg into pieces !"

[Picard]
"Turn off the monitors. I  can't  stand  to  watch,  not even the Borg
deserve that."
