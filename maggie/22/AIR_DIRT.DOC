                           THE AIR DIRT DEMO
                             BY SENIOR DADS 
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
In the beginning there was "Anal Tuck". And "Anal Tuck" was good. But 
the people were thirsty for more, and lo  the  dads  did  present "The 
Water Demo". And the people saw that the water demo was good and there 
was much rejoicing. And on the third day the dads returned with..."The 
Air Dirt Demo".

The Senior Dads posse has increased significantly  since the early days 
of Nonce & Jessie. It has been rumoured that Doddering Git has been 
headhunted to Sony to write the  operating  system  for  the  
Playstation,  whilst  Bill  Gates  seems desperate to get his hands on 
Old Fart.  Not  to offer him a job, he just enjoys feeling up 
pensioners.

On loading this demo a great rendered ascii  logo of the dads scrolls 
by and you are presented with the immortal words

       W3Lc0Me3 2 dA
       A I R   D I R T   D E M O

A shiver of excitement runs down your spine.

The Dads give you the choice of  toggling  the speaker on or off. 
Thoughtful, as well as talented.

Some mesmeric flashing logos introduce  the  demo,  and  there  is a 
great Atari Faclon 030 logo with some cunning eyes  staring  from the 
zeros. They are saying "keep your eyes on this demo as it is going to 
be worth watching".

The screen shimmers with a brilliant "Air Dirt" logo painted by Jackson 
Pollock. 

The choice of colours is breathtaking.

We are now led through a "credits gallery", where each member of the 
senior dads is presented with a portrait skilfully painted by Jackson 
Pollock.

First is main coder "Old Fart" looking his usual cheerful self. 

Next up is coder "Doddering Git" looking rather grumpy, though he would 
no doubt prefer the term contemplative. 

Musician "Dame Vera Lynn" stands proudly blowing an enormous trumpet! 

Jackson Pollock chooses to draw himself as  an abstract scribble, which 
I see as a comment of  the  futility  of  the  computer  screen  as  a 
representative art interface.

Other demos have given you  starfields  with  1,000  2,000  8,000 or 
even 10,000 dots. But never before  have  Falcon  owners  been  treated  
to 64,000 dots each whizzing past your head at the  speed  of  light.  
The effect is encapsulating - like sharing a tumble dryer with Harry 
Secombe and Suzanne Charlton.

"Shade Bobs" announces the text. If this  was another demo crew you 
would groan, but you know that  the  Senior  Dads  will  take  even  
commonplace effects into unknown  territory.  The   Dads   cunningly   
switch   conventional  "bobs"  for representations of "dads" and thus 
Shade-Dads are born. The music rises in tempo as a glorious spectrum of 
shade dads fills the screen.

Another splendid senior dads picture appears,  this time featuring 
Doddering Git in medieval attire proclaiming that the senior dads are 
the dads who like to say "NI!". The attention to detail on this picture 
are startling - the clothing, the font, the wording all totally  free  
of  anachronism. You are almost transported back to England in the 
middle ages, and the words of Chaucer are started to ring around your 
ears when you are abruptly whisked into the next effect.

"Filled Vector Tunnel". The dads are not one  for wimpy dot tunnels. 
Why use one pixel when 4,870 will suffice?  The  effect  of  flying  
down  the tunnel was so realistic that I actually fell off my seat!  
The Dads coding is so hardcore that even the Videl chip can't keep up!  
They  push  it  so far to the limits that it starts steaming the tunnel 
starts warping in itself. It is almost like they have created a 
wormhole through space and time.

Even the best demos need design,  and  the  Dads  don't let us down. 
Whilst some lesser crews may just stick a mushroom in  the  corner, the 
dads do a lot better with a full screen apple (scientifically proved as 
the fruit containing the most design). Also included on the screen are 
the words "NOT HAPPY" - yes Pollock has also managed to pen a stinging 
comment of the state of today's youth. Design and politics in one 
screen. Astonishing.

Pollock now shows us the depth of his talent with a sumptuous raytraced 
picture. Hovering over a sparkling chessboard  are  three superbly 
rendered objects. They even have shadows and lens flair! You  thought 
this was only possible on silicon graphics machines, now it has been 
done on the Falcon.

The standard texture mapped cube has become  a rather cliched affair. A 
spinning box featuring some true colour graphics?  Boring!  The Senior 
Dads have read the change in climate and present the  texture  mapped  
cube  in a new format. First they use just one colour making  it  
appear subtle, understated yet elegant. And second they don't rotate  
the  cube.  When  you  rotate  texture mapped cubes it becomes hard to 
see that graphics, and all that spinning can make you feel dizzy 
(especially if you are an octogenarian with a heart condition).

The Dads' cube features a Fuji, A senior dads logo and the grinning 
face of "old fart". There is also another first in  this  demo, texture 
mapping with a scroll text! The scroller is also synced to the  3D so 
when the cube stops the scroller speeds up. The cube is even 
perspective correct. Coding genius.

"Fire! Fire! Fire!", no don't worry  Maggie  HQ  is  not burning down, 
I am just making a comment on the next effect.  Whilst traditional fire 
usually appears as boring flames, the Dads have turned fire quite 
literally on its head. There is a fire scroller which burns with a  
passion  as  above  it fire-dads are ablaze in empathy. This is so 
realistic that  I  had  actually called 999, but fortunately the next 
effect appeared before I gave my address.

So far the  dads  have  managed  to  push  the  Falcon  beyond  its 
known limits _without_ using the DSP. Now they decide  to push their 
ancient talents onto the 56001.

The start of the "DSP Section"  is  accompanied  with an ABBA sample. 
They can't use the DSP for the tracker music as  it  is  full of their 
3D code. And what is this 3D code doing? Why, simply creating  the most 
fantastic game the Falcon has ever seen.

Entitled "Poom" we are given a jaw  dropping  preview in this demo. 
Poom, as you may have guessed, is a Doom clone.  But  it  beats such 
efforts as "Bad Mood" by having gouraud-phong shaded texture mapping. 
But the  real twist is that this is a stereogram game. You must  
remember  those  pictures  so popular two years ago which seemed to be 
a random  collection  of  dots,  but when you screwed up your eyes for 
two hours and  took  lots  of  drugs  they  still  looked like a random 
collection of dots. Well here it is on the Falcon. We knew the DSP was 
powerful, but we didn't know it was this powerful.

The dads are convinced that Poom will be  a Format Gold, sadly the 
demise of the publication will rob them of this deserved award. But 
"Format" will certainly be on the lips of everyone when they receive  a 
disk with the final version of this game on it.

Another great Jackson Pollock logo appears,  this  time  it is a Senior 
Dads one and is officially copyrighted so unfortunately we can't use it 
in Maggie without months of potentially bankrupting legal action.

Like Damien Hirst and Irving Welsh before  them,  the  Dads are now the 
toast of the young trendy pop set. Pop down  any  Camden  watering hole 
and you will hear media celebrities discussing the relative merits  of 
Doddering Git and Old Fart. It is only a matter of weeks before  Dame  
Vera  Lynn will make the cover of the NME. So it comes as  no  surprise  
that  Damon  Albarn  (from popular beat combo "Blur") has agreed to 
appear in the demo.

Damon appears in a wildly exciting motion blur effect, but still 
manages to sing "parklife" as he blurrs across the  screen.  Rumour  
has  it that Shed 7 drummer Alan Leach is to feature in the Z-Buffer 
section of the next EXA demo.

"The Tit Girl!". Damon isn't the  only  celebrity  to appear in the 
demo. Louise Wener from sleeper blagged her way  onto  air  dirt.  I 
would tell my scurrilous story about an  Ice  Cube  and  a  certain  
part  of  Miss  Wener's anatomy, but unfortunately the libel laws are 
against us. Louise persuaded Jackson Pollock to paint her in a state of 
undress,  this  is  the type of biting anti-pc statement that she has 
built her career on. And as  Doddering  Git says, she is a bit of a 
babe! Nice pants, too.

Another Jackson Pollock  picture,  this  time  featuring  the  great 
man himself looking rather stern.  This  is  to  introduce  his  
impeding  MPEG  style video compression system which features on the 
end credits.

If the rest of the demo  had  been  both  inspired  and inspirational, 
it is the finale which is the coupe de grace,  the  icing  on  the 
cake, the casing on the Falcon. The music changes into some serious Sex 
Pistols riffs. A big Jonny Roten stand on the right  of  the  screen  
and  then  he  begins singing, swinging his microphone to and fro. Just 
when  you  thought  it couldn't get any better Steve Matlock appear to 
dribble  some  axe  mayhem  of  the proceedings. Besides these 
characters is an  end  scroller  which  provides  a  stunning  insight  
into the creation of the demo.

The dads have pushed the Falcon so far that at the end the entire 
memory is full and there is no more  room  for  the  end  section.  The 
Falcon reaches its very limits and crashes - this  is  a  real  rock  
and  roll  exit, equivalent to the guitarist smashing his guitar at the 
end of the gig.

At the finish all that is left is the knowledge that you have just seen 
the best ever Falcon demo, and the sound of a reverberating keyclick.

TECH VIEW: The Senior Dads do it again. The only criticism is that the  
clipping on the "doom" clone is not quite correct. Get it sorted lads!  
Staggering. [tat]
