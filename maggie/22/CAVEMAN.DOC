CaveMania Demo
„
by Kev "Taffy" Davies

Quite a while at the "Atari World" show, a piece of software 
caught my eye. There sitting on a stand, a PD game for the Falcon 
which I had not seen before. Okay so it's a game, but who said I 
was a "serious" user („Me serious? Never ;-> ). "Cavemania" is 
it's name, and yep, you guest it, another "Boulderdash" clone has 
arrived.     

  What? You've never heard of "Boulderdash"? For the benefit of 
those of you with limited memory here is a brief run down of what 
goes on.   

 You control a little guy tunnelling his way through a cave full 
of dirt, collecting gems and trying to avoid having his skull 
caved in by boulders which can fall if the dirt below them is 
removed, hence the title.   Don't let the idea of yet another re-
hash of this classic title put you off checking this out, after 
all it  is Falcon specific, and as with all „(okay, most) Falcon 
only titles this is technically a pretty damn fine piece of code. 

The game starts with an options screen, presented with the 
"Cavemania" logo produced in a rather nice falling block kinda 
way, while tunes pump from the speakers. Parts of the options 
menu itself are a little quirky, but once you get used to them 
they become second„ („okay, maybe fourth) nature. Then on into the 
game.  Your character is what appears to be a little blue man 
(„kind of a fat  "Morph"), who moves around the play area (a cave) 
in a sort of floating-non-animation kind of way. This tends to 
make the game feel tacky, and even the extremely smooth scrolling 
cannot remove this chewing gum feel. Being fair though, the other 
graphics are generally very well drawn and are simply animated, 
but work well in the vertically overscanned environment.

 The sound it also quite good, as you  would expect if a title 
reports to be Falcon specific, a good little tune bops along, 
although I was unsure whether it was a looped sample, or just a 
rather repetitive tracker module. No matter it still grinded on 
the nerves after a while, with no way to turn it off within the 
program I had to resort to placing a thick book over the internal 
Atari "speaker". When "Morph" bites the dust some high quality 
samples of "Jabba the Hut" laughing are pumped out just to rub in 
your previous demise.

 Although technically very good, and the demo giving a real 
indication of gameplay („which was far to difficult) I was left 
feeling very unfulfilled, and to be honest quite bored by the 
whole thing by the second go. Obviously "Extreme" („the coders) 
have put a lot of work into Cavemania's presentation,and have 
relied on a good solid game format. So what the hell happened! 

Maybe they should take a look at "Double Bobble 2000"!?!
