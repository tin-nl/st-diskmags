An interesting hour spent with the PC emulation of MagiC.. 

This is a quick overview of the PC/Intel version of MagiC, supplied in 
demonstration form by System Solutions, and is not intended as a full 
review as such.. Our written impressions were gained from a grazing and 
tentative first contact with that version of MagiC, and we apologise in 
advance for any potentially misleading information which may well be 
corrected in a proper future evaluation..

Enough of that, and on with the fun..

The story starts at the Autumn Atari Shows, as the demo version is in 
wide circulation there, and a copy ends up on my hard drive.. It is PC 
software, and no immediate use to me, but there are several ex-ST 
owning PC people in the neighbourhood who might well benefit.. Finding 
Mark (of Wellingboro' computer club past fame) and remembering he has 
Windows '95, a precondition for this demo to run, suggest that we 
visit.. (CiH implicated in Maggie 'royal we' shock!) I also bring along 
a range of likely software to try out with the emulator..

Reading the instruction file is interesting, it includes a full 
emulation of the Motorola 68xxx cpu in software, and needs no 
additional hardware, apart from a soundblaster compatible soundcard if 
you want emulation of the squeaky Yamaha soundchip.. As such, it 
promises to be a big step forward over present ST emulators which come 
expensively on a plug in board, and still only offer GEM-legal 
compatibility.. The price for the full product is around sixty-odd 
pounds, which is very reasonable for an ST emulator capable of TT plus 
speed, and similar to the going rate for a second-hand ST..

Installation is a breeze, as the demo comes in one big .ZIP file, and 
unzips quickly enough.. Booting Windowze '95 and setting up MagiC only 
takes about a minute as well, we click, and we are off!!

A very smart dialog box within a 640 x 480 onscreen window appears.. It 
is a very nicely designed box, and has to be, as we are going to see a 
lot of it in the next hour or so.. When the emulator is running, it 
appears every couple of minutes to see how you are getting on, and to 
remind you that this is a demo version.. From the dialog, there is a 
set up menu, where you can customise the emulator to your tastes, and 
such things as TOS compatibility, Yamaha soundchip emulation, grow and 
shrink boxes, and screen modes can be set..

We breeze through that, and start up the emulator, which boots up in a 
tantalisingly familiar 'ST Medium' mode within the window.. We back out 
to take another look at the available screen modes, not too many 
there.. ST low and medium res, ST mono (640 x 400) and TT medium res, 
(640 x 480 in 16 colours, STe pallette..) I would imagine that in the 
full version, and future updates, more screen modes, including 
customisable ones with more colours on screen (256), and higher 
resolutions will be included..

Of those, the prettiest is the TT medium, which gives us the MagiC 
desktop in nicely designed sculpted 3-D look 16 colour icons.. TT 
medium is also a pretty good mode in which to kick off the first of our 
Atari applications, Imagecopy 4, which takes to it like on old friend, 
recently rediscovered.. Imagecopy runs without hesitation, and does a 
good job of displaying the available pictures, both old 16 colour ST 
screens, that Mark had around, and dithered 256 colour PC GIFs..

Speed of light 3.8 also runs, but is a little more hesitant about how 
it displays the pictures, leaving chunks missing unless the pictures 
are sized down to half size..

We back out of the emulator and try out some applications in old 
fashioned ST medium res.. First up, is that ancient asteroids clone, 
'Megaroids', which does work, although we can't quite get to grips with 
the keymap, which is faithfully emulated, but some keys are in slightly 
different places.. It runs with a just a little hint of a judder..

Moving onto something  moderately higher risk, and we try out ST News 
(issue 10.2) with the sound set wisely off be me beforehand.. This one 
*just about* runs, as the GFA coded menu appears, but trails and leave 
little bits still on the screen.. Articles load, scroll, and read just 
fine however.. The one silly thing I did do was to set the bottom 
border greets scroller on.. Now if there is one thing ST News readers 
running it under MagiC should not do, never EVER activate the border 
scroller, as it won't go away, even if you leave ST News.. MagiC then 
was reluctant to shut down as it decided that ST News was still 
running.. Eventually, I got ST News to reappear, and gratefully quit 
out..

Yes, we did try Maggie in a 'what the hell, lets go for it' spirit and 
got rewarded with lots of bombs on screen, and the message 'System 
Destroyed', which I would imagine puts it under severe doubt for any 
other form of MagiC compatibility as well..

After trying out one or two fairly harmless text editors, we decided to 
leave the other (GFA coded) games to one side for the moment, and 
looked around the system a bit more..

This demo set up its own 'C' drive area, running a virtual hard disk, 
with several small applications to demonstrate the multi tasking 
abilities, which we only briefly touched on.. The system dialog 
suggested that other PC-specific hard drive partitions could be 
accessed, and indeed, this emulation could allow access to the serial 
port as well, but we did not explore those in too much detail..

In general feel, the system ran quickly, but the mouse pointer moved a 
bit fuzzily as screen updating felt similar to the Sebra mono 
emulator.. This was another option that could be changed, with either a 
fast emulation speed, and jerky mouse, or fine mouse control, and 
slower emulation.. The GEM Bench results below do tend to suggest that 
this emulation is capable of a fair turn of speed though..

At this point in time, it seems that MagiC is an essential purchase for 
any PC owner with a large collection of high quality ST based 
applications.. Even a lot of older GEM programs should run as well.. It 
would be interesting to see a compatibility list, and I would imagine 
that most major GEM based programs should run here.. With the hardware 
element totally removed, this provides a totally affordable and 
reliable means of ST emulation for the PC, although a 'total' ST 
emulation, that is able to run the majority of games, etc, is still 
some way off.. (On that subject, does anybody have any feedback on the 
'STonX' X-Windows/Unix emulator??)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
One final thing, we did have the presence of mind to run GEM Bench, and 
the results were recorded, and can be seen below.. The end results do 
reflect the system that ran the emulation was an Intel 120 mhz Pentium 
PC compatible..
