    For those lucky people who  made  it  along  to the Atari show in 
Birmingham, back in the mists of September, they may have noticed that 
proudly  displayed  on  one  of  the   stands  was  a  pile  of  Atari 
Calculators.  Yes calculators.  Yes made by  Atari..  Oh why do I feel 
my heart beginning to sink already?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Here follows a Review of the  official Atari 'Auto Recall Calculator', 
(yes it DOES exist, no we are not  making this up, it's not April yet) 
for people who REALLY have nothing better to do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
You were warned... 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    I fully own up to  being  a  sad  Atari  fanatic, and as all such 
people, could not resist the temptation  to complete my range of Atari 
products (although the Atari Toaster  and  Atari  Luxury Foot Spar are 
noticeable gaps in my collection -  as  is the Atari Microbox, Phenix, 
Virtuality Helmet, Jaguar II (we get  the point -Ed)...) by purchasing 
the said piece of hardware.  No, it  was not just because the case had 
a little silver Atari  logo  and  Fuji  on  it,  I  did  really need a 
calculator.  I did!  Honest.  Well..  okay,  it  was  because it had a 
nice silvery logo, but aw.. come on,  admit  it, you want it too don't 
you!  I can hear you drooling over the very idea of being able to whip 
out a pocket-sized Atari machine, to  hold   in  the very palm of your 
hand as you stand  in  the  bank  queue   nochalantly pretending to be 
working out the  non-existent  profit,  you  haven't  made,  from your 
imaginary shares..

    So on  to  the  aesthetic  appeal  of  the  Atari  'Auto  Recall' 
Calculator (with 32-Step Memory Playback).   There is no beating about 
the bush: (or the  Bodin)  this  Calculator  is attractively packaged. 
Some might say seductively so, if they  were party to the knowledge of 
just how susceptible all Atari  owners  are  to anything bearing their 
favourite five  letter  name  &  accompanying  symbol.   The cardboard 
packet boasts a large, multicoloured  logo  emblazoned over a textured 
stone background.  The machine itself is  rather dwarfed by the visual 
qualities of its surroundings,  being  typically predominantly GREY in 
colour, with perhaps the odd  highlight  of  dove  grey,  as well as a 
little charcoal grey and the  possibility  of some stone grey creeping 
in around the edges..  A swift  comparison of the Calculator's grey to 
my Falcon's grey reveals that it  is  not  in fact the same shade.. in 
fact, even more interestingly, not one  of the  three greys located on 
the calc corresponded with the dual greys  of my Falc.. (ENOUGH on the 
subject of grey.  The writing is in danger of taking on the same shade 
I think -Ed). 
  
  One feature which makes  the  exterior  of  the calc recognisably 
Atari (apart from the logo) is  a  small  line of rhombuses which look 
suspiciously like function keys.   However  they  are only 'background 
graphics' and were probably included to  reassure the Atari owner that 
he/she has invested in a genuine Atari product.

    The number pad is similar to  the standard numerical keypad found 
on STs &  Falcs,  but  the  really  innovative, original, enterprising 
design idea, is that while  the  '='  button  is  the same size as the 
numbers, i.e. small, the '+'  button  is  huge  and monopolizes a vast 
area of the 'keyboard', so it is easy to assume that it is in fact the 
'=' button.  Added to this,  your  finger  always seems to encounter a 
corner of  it  whatever  its  intended  destination  and   thus,  by a 
combination of arse-design and  even arser-design,  mathematical chaos 
ensues..  cheers Alastair, you always did  come up with the good ideas 

- Atari Landmines wasn't it?

    A mention must be made of  the  buttons themselves which make the 
Spectrum 48K's Rubber Keys seem  like  an achingly blissful utopia and 
not the hammer-horror (in the literal  sense) that they actually were. 
Spongy just doesn't begin to describe  these guys.  As unresponsive as 
an Atari mouse would be a good start..

    When I managed to  turn  my  calc  on, after several unsuccessful 
depressions of the 'On'  button,  the  LCD  was suspiciously faint and 
flickery and made me wonder whether these calculators had been sitting 
around in a warehouse for  ten  odd  years after their initial release 
date, (to make sure the  market  was  ready  for  them - the nostalgia 
market that is) with  the  batteries  quietly  leaking away.  Or, more 
realistically, sitting under several tonnes of  sand out in the Nevada 
dessert - Warehouses! what was I thinking of!

    The calc comes with its  own  little  case,  a slim black number, 
carrying the aforementioned silver name-tag.   Pretty  neat you may be 
thinking as your  brain  conjures  up  images  of  sleek, supple cases 
moulding themselves around the machine  as  a  glove fits a hand.  But 
you would be OH SO wrong.  On attempting  to put my calc in its case I 
find that it doesn't fit and  a  good  centimetre protrudes out of the 
top.  Add to this the  fact  that  the  logo  has  been printed on the 
back.. and you begin to get the  picture  of just how 'made in Taiwan' 
it is.

    But as was previously mentioned, this  is  not just any old piece 
of junk calculator.  It  is  an  'Auto  Recall Calculator' which means 
that you can recall each step  of  your equation, thus if you inputted 
the following: '3 + 5 - 8  x  2  =', the number [faintly] displayed at 
the close would be '0', but  you  could  then press the special recall 
buttons to go back through the steps of your equation and you would be 
treated to this sequence: replay 5: '=', replay 4: '2 x', replay 3: '8 
-', replay 2: '5 +',  replay  1:  '3'.   Wow.   What a function.  Well 
worth the 3 whatever I paid for it.

       So there we have it.   Atari.   They  can't even make a decent 
calculator.. but we'll  forgive  them.   And  defend  them.  And boast 
about what amazing calculators they make, embroidering extensively and 
exaggerating eccentrically  the  usefulness  and  originally  of 'Auto 
Recall', with its 32-step memory playback.

But then how can we not love their bungling, endearing ways!
