ÅBy Shadows

Just lately, the Polish scene is starting to come to life again, as a 
Falcon demo by the Shadows appears.. The Polish scene always has played 
a big part on the Atari, even since 8-Bit days.. Indeed, one report has 
their 8-Bit scene still alive and kicking and recently producing some 
excellent work that could even put most ST demos to shame.. I've been 
lucky enough to witness several Atari 8-Bit demos last summer, and yes, 
most of these seem to have Polish sounding names involved, and yes, 
they were damned good..

Bringing the story up to date, we now have the first widely circulated 
Falcon demo from a Polish team, the Firestarter Demo, not at all 
influenced by the title and lyrical content of a recent popular tune, 
oh no!

The people doing this come under the collective title of the Shadows, 
and they start conventionally enough.. A series of text credits and 
high-res logos leave us in no doubt as to who is producing this demo.. 
the final logo puffs out of existence in a ball of computer generated 
fire, and we are off..

The first bit is a new slant on a traditional standby, as there is a 
rotate and zoom in glorious Falcon truecolour, but this is intercut 
with another zoomer in time to a bold techno inspired soundtrack with 
traces of electric guitar.. 

The next bit is something at least original with a morphing face mask 
all on its own on the screen, but moving pixellated facial muscles 
around to give us various facial expressions..

Another conventional effect with a reflective, or is that refractive 
transparent glass ball bouncing unconcernedly against a very colourful 
still plasma type background.. The next bit is a sort of grey globby 
contouring plasma that moves around the screen but does not do a great 
deal else..

The artist is given a chance to show off again, as a very high res logo 
is displayed firstly in greyscale mono, and then 'coloured in' to await 
the next effect..

This is probably technically the most interesting bit of the demo, as 
there seems to be some sort of bump-map effect going on.. A spotlight 
moves across a graffiti-smiley stained wall, illuminating the bit that 
it touches.. The wall is rather lumpy in texture to accentuate the 
lighting effect..

The next bit we've all definitely seen before, especially people who 
attended the London end of things at the Autumn Atari Shows, who got to 
see the 'Obnoxious' demo several times.. So therefore, the flaming 
vector line polygon is totally familiar to you. It is reproduced here, 
but differently coloured.. More an arctic blue than a flaming red..

Near to the end, and a sort of blurry forest type background plays host 
to a complex 3-D textured polygon, with the textures moving about etc.. 
A qick cut to another very high-res cartoon picture (Two stupid dogs) 
and some functionally fast textual greetings, and we are back with the 
final series of 3-D objects, again, against the treeline, we have some 
shaded solid objects, a little bloke and a multipointed star stick out 
as they spin their thing onscreen..

This is the end, as big letters onscreen tell us precisely that..


TECH VIEW by Tat: 
The  Poles  are  coming!   Contrast  this  with  the  Gloop  demo  for
presentation.

The code looks to be of the real "quick and dirty" approach (look at 
the intro section - the funny flickers come from changing the palette 
while the screen is being displayed) but is more advanced in 
complexity than most of the other demos this issue. Again no DSP, but 
there are a couple of coding highlights: the bump mapping is difficult 
since it requires quite a few data tables (and planning) and the 3D 
objects have a bit of style and a proper background, not in a little 
square in the corner. The object fadeout is good too.

Elsewhere we have the usual old effect copies - rotzoom, fire effect - 
but the new idea/old idea is still quite high. Somehow, I really like 
it. More please! [tat]

Late note: I hear the later version has just been released, but the 
above comments still stand coding-wise.


ÅRatings..

ÅGraphix:- 83% - Some good presentation, some nice and original still 
material, some screens with a good hi-res interlace, some other effects 
a bit chunky and slightly unpolished looking, but generally ok..

ÅSonix:- 80% - Reasonable to good tune, probably Protracker type mod, 
one which kept mostly in time with the demo as well..

ÅGee-Whiz:- 85% - Mostly new slants on previously seen effects, but with 
a nice bump-map screen in there?

ÅOverall:- 83% - A good first effort for the Falcon, look forward to 
hearing more from this crew..
