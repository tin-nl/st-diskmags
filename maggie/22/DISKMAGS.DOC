ÖD i s k m a g s  -  N e w s  &  R e v i e w s  

This time around, a slew of reviews, old favourites, newish kids on the 
block and all..
Ö
First up, is a fairly new HTML-based newsletter/diskmag formerly known 
as the Croft Soft Newsletter, now called...
Ö

ÅAtari Times issue 6

Croft Soft decided to expand the newsletter to a full-blown diskmag 
back in August, with the release of issue 4, of what became Atari 
Times.. The original aim of the newsletter, was, I suppose, to promote 
the activities of the Croft Soft programming crew, a group active in 
one form or another since 1987.. However, the temptation to include 
other news and views of the general Atari scene, just proved too much 
temptation, and so a full-blown diskmag was a logical sort of 
outcome..
Å
What you get is about 300-odd kilobytes of data, the greater part 
picture data, slung together in HTML format, and needing a suitable 
browser, such as CAB (current version 1.41) to see it.. Most people on 
the Atari scene now, seem to have a web browser of one sort or another, 
and one would imagine that non-Atari people, will have their own 
browser, making this magazine cross platform compatible..
Å
There is a start point, which is a sort of 'home page', or menu page, 
from where you can go to the various parts of the mag, this gives a 
list  of the various issues, with a brief description of the contents.. 
Finding issue 6, we give it a click to go on to the next part, which is 
the main menu page.. This part is graphical, with several suitably 
drawn option boxes to click on.. Such areas such as news, reviews, 
previews, interviews, top ten, and even the Croft Soft information 
pages are there to click on.. The layout is well planned, and allows 
you to move around the various parts of the magazine pretty quickly.. 
Grpahically, quite well done, with several articles livened up with the 
addition of suitable graphical data in a 'picture within text' 
fashion.. Certainly one of the better HTML designs.. Loading times 
within CAB are reasonably quick as well, a balance between article 
length and loading time managed quite well here.. 

News is a follow-up to the Atari Show, and successful launch of Atari 
Computing.. Nothing else too new, apart from confirmation of the fact 
that Atari Computing have reprinted by popular demand.. Reviews are 
interesting, and well written, and no, I'm not going to dwell a long 
time on the favourable review for Maggie 21 that they gave.. There are 
some other equally informative reviews, such as Atari Karts on the 
Jaguar, and a review of Papyrus 4 with copious pictures in text, which 
is up to the sort of standard found in Atariphile.. This is probably 
one of the highlights of the mag.. The new Sub-Station clone released 
by Goodmans, also gets a spot in here as well..

The other major article, is a good interview with Colin Fisher Mcallum, 
which probably fills some gaps that our interview left!
Å
An ST/Jaguar type cheats section is included, a list of top ten games 
by a reader as well, information about Croft Soft games, and their 
shortly forthcoming release, 'Mole Mayhem' is also included..
Å
Atari Times turns out to be fairly short in the text department, around 
90-100 kilobytes in all, although that might make for a short and 
palatable experience for people who don't go for the bigger diskmags.. 
The overall quality is good, and with a few more articles, this could 
be a serious competitor to the likes of Atariphile..

(Update note:- Issue 7 was released for the November/December period..)
Å
Summary:- HTML format publication, released monthly, but probably bi-
monthly or frequent 'as and when ready' basis from now on.. Needs CAB 
or other suitable Web browser.. Multi-platform compatible, spread via 
BBS network, but will fit comfortably on D/S disk.. Articles, fairly 
few in number, but good quality.. Prospects, promising..

ÑOverall, seven out of ten..Å

(Bloody nice ASCII logo by the way!!)

This is a French 'scene' orientated diskmag with a suitably zappy 
custom menu shell and text displayer.. 'Toxic' seems to follow in the 
mould of Maggie and DBA with news of current demos, diskmags and 
games..

Turning to the text displayer part first of all, you get an ST-ish 
screen panel which is filled by text on a white on black type display, 
bordered by a 16 colour texture fill thing, and there is a graphical 
control panel for the text options at the side.. Parts of the display 
reminded me of the Delta Force Maggie displayer whilst other aspects 
reminded me of the DBA ST text displayer.. Instead of scrolling up and 
down a textfile like the other two displayers, these flick over pages.. 
You do get a discreet 'picture in text' option as well, which is used 
with 4 and 16 colour material in greyscale format in a few places.. 
Some very nice title or masthead graphics, such as the one for the Lynx 
reviews use this system to good effect as well..   The control panel is 
mouse pointer operated, but there is a full duplication via the 
keyboard.. The usual 'Up/Down' 'Help' 'Music on/off' type controls are 
all there, including another one to get you to the main menu..

This is quite well put together with a listing in small text of the 
various articles therein, and the mouse is moved to scroll up and down 
the listings.. An additional menu ('Face B') has the remainder of the 
articles, and some tasteful topless pictures as well.. The whole 
construction is quite slick, and has the benefit of running without 
problems on the Falcon, even from the custom screen modes without 
having to change down first.. Music is soundchip, and switchable on or 
off.. The menu gives nothing extra to Falcon owners, but can be 
compared directly with a good ST shell such as ours, or 'Eye on the 
Scene', which does perfectly well on a 'one shell for all' principle..

There are a couple of nice intros, one of which is Falcon compatible..

There is also a 'Goodies' type folder full of little programs or 
routines, some of which is quite old, but some other original material 
as well..

Articles-wise, there are quite a lot, getting on for 700k, and a very 
wide variety too, but they are all French language.. The news and 
reviews do seem to be current for the period, and they get as far as 
running the realtime text from the Gigafun '96 coding party (which is 
also nearly all French).. Disk mag reviews take in Maggie 19, there are 
several demo and game reviews of early and mid 1996 vintage, French 
scene news and views, interviews, articles on the merits of the Jag CD 
and Playstation, a very comprehensive Lynx history/FAQ text, Manga 
reviews, various music reviews and a lot more.. In terms of content, it 
seems that Toxic Mag are doing a good job, even if my grasp of French 
is very sketchy..

Toxic Mag is a good example of the classic 'Scene' mag, even taking the 
possible language barrier into account..

ÅSummary:- Fancy Custom shell, released as and when, probably two or 
three issues a year.. Works fine on any ST and Falcon as well, comes on 
single D/S disk, and runs from same.. Articles, French language, but 
large number of varied topics, with large scene coverage.. Prospects, 
okay, as long as will to keep going still there..

ÑOverall, seven and a half out of ten (eight if you are French)..Å


ÅAtariphile 4

The latest issue of the HTML-based 'serious users' bible has just been 
released on the 1st December 1996.. Atariphile has maintained the early 
promise shown in issue 1, and comes to us bigger than ever on the 
equivalent of a high density disk.. Atariphile seems to have grown 
along with its support software, the Crystal Atari Browser, or CAB, 
which is now a much more stable and mature program than this time last 
year..

Atariphile also has some big ambitions about what it reviews. The 
flagship article has to be a very detailed appraisal of rival 
replacement desktops, a cut-down version of which also appeared in 
Atari Computing's issue 2.. Other reviews include a quick look at the 
Papyrus 4 upgrade, a look at multitasking, a very large Cubase and MIDI 
input, the continuing tutorial on POV Raytracer, and to lighten things 
up, even a pilots guide to the game 'Frontier'.. Also to be found are 
reviews of Positive Image, and the 'Doom' game on ST, 'Destruction 
Imminent' among several others..

A joking reference to borrowing a '060 powered Hades super-TT clone to 
review was made, we suspect that they may have only been half joking! 

Of the regular columns, the news features a slew of press releases from 
the likes of System Solutions and Titan Designs, and even news of a new 
Falcon-based clone from a French company Centek, and their Nemesis-type 
accelerator board.. Comms news by John Nott giving some slightly 
premature details of the likely direction of the next Maggie 
compilation issue!! 

Copious use of in-text graphics and screengrabs on all articles mark 
this out from run of the mill HTML efforts, there are even Xmas tree 
fairy lights on the Home Page! other graphical features include tiny 
cut-outs of Apex Alpha, and screengrabs and examples of just about 
everything they reviewed.. Even the Frontier article had them!

Certainly, Atariphile can give any mainstream magazine on any platform 
a run for its money.. The diskmag format allows it to go into greater 
detail than even the likes of Atari Computing can manage, and is 
recommended for the more knowledgeable Atari user, or for someone who 
aspires to becoming a more knowledgeable Atari User.. The style is not 
too heavy going, and even the initially less tempting portions of the 
menu bar showed up with some pleasant surprises.. The only slight 
criticism I might have is that of information overload in places, as my 
eyes started to glaze over after a while marooned with the replacement 
desktops feature.. Still, an invaluable reference guide to someone 
contemplating a replacement desktop, cannot be sniffed at that easily..

*Not* really Recommended..

If you are into demo or 'scene' coverage, routinely write your own 
'custom DSP or VIDEL routines on your Falcon, own all Falcon demos that 
only run on RGB, and have a total antipathy to system legal and/or GEM 
type software..

*Definitely* Recommended..

If you have more system patches than your RAM can safely hold, a boot 
manager with more knobs on than the Space Shuttle, and a desktop and 
multi-tasking O/S that would scare the underwear off Saddam Hussein.. A 
new version of Calamus makes you go all dewy-eyed perhaps..

Horses for courses in other words, but still, this is a damned fine 
read for just about anyone..

ÅSummary:- HTML based, needs CAB 1.3 or above to work properly.. 
ÅBasically Bi-Monthly, works on any machine capable of supporting a web 
browser, seen to best effect on Falcon or other machine capable of more 
colours (256) and better resolution.. Distributed on equivalent of H/D 
disk.. Articles, among the best-written and most informative in the 
business if aimed at a particular part of the Atari scene.. Prospects, 
should be good for quite a few more issues yet..

ÑOverall, a definite nine out of ten..Å 


ÅKelstar 6

Yes, its the Scottish mag back with us once more in its brand new Tony 
Greenwood inspired clothing.. Once again, a very sizeable issue with a 
very varied nature of content.. 

As is the case, Bob Kell is sticking to his 'non-techie' bias, and this 
magazine can be seen as the flip-side of something like 'Atariphile' 
which can be seen as the Atari 'Power user' Bible.. Indeed, also the 
flip-side of Maggie, which is the home of the hardcore demo fan.. It is 
easy to see the entire Atari scene here in the UK as a four-cornered 
entity, the top end replacement desktop loving wannabe Hades clone 
owners, the ASM coding Falcon demo/game freaks, the STOS blokes and 
blokettes, and the people who just want to plug in their ST's for a 
laugh without having to ask searching questions as to how the thing 
works..  The last of these groupings would seem to be Bob's natural 
constituency..

The new shell first of all.. It can be best described as a simplified 
version of Dave Hollis's 'ST+' shell, but retaining certain common 
features, such as the text displayer from Tony G's generic diskmag 
creator, and the help screen from earlier versions of ST+.. The general 
layout of the magazine is very clean, and uses a combination of 
scrolling up and down a text menu for articles, and a page system to 
access different sections of the magazine. The main menu picture is 
four colour only, in this case a lovely looking female from the world 
of fantasy airbrush art which translated quite well down to four 
colours.. A row of large 'help' buttons at the top left, change 
colours, music on/off, 'help' etc.. A soundchip tune tinkle-plops away 
merrily in the background.. 

This shell manages to be Falcon compatible, if booted from 'Backward' 
(and after fixing with Generic fixer, it did not want to know at 
first!) As far as I can tell, there are no fancy options such as 
'pictures in text', or separate 16 colour picture displayers present, 
as found in ST+.. Nor are there likely to be, as Bob Kell wishes to 
keep Kelstar half-meg compatible..

As an incidental note of interest, the 'help' screen looks rather 
blurred and mangled, and we wonder if something went wrong in the 
production process?

A selection of intros, some of which get in the way of the mag loading 
on the Falcon precede the main action..

Articles-wise, Kelstar is falling into a regular pattern established 
fully around issue five.. Some original writings from Bob himself, a 
fairly large and sprawling 'contacts' section that pops up in several 
different guises, competitions, a few reviews including one of the 
diskmag you are reading now.. Also quite a lot of jokes of the sort 
that got ST Format all steamed up, and some of the largest articles 
being things like the Jaguar FAQ file (updated post-JTS), various net-
grabbed and American biased 'computer humour' texts, and also things 
like the Don Thomas letter that are well known to everyone now.. There 
are a lot of articles for this issue, but some of them are quite 
short.. My favourites include the Birmingham Atari Show Realtime 
article, which had a fleeting involvement from the Maggie Team, and a 
hilarious spoof realtime which describes Bob's wife giving birth..

Oddly missing is the mad Scottish person, Mad Ron, who got everyone 
steamed up with his views on the state of the country.. The dying 
echoes can still be seen in this issue with a letter basically slagging 
his point of view, but nothing more has been heard from the man himself 
for a couple of issues now..

On the evidence shown to us in the form of Kelstar 6, this is cerainly 
a magazine that will be around for a while.. The 'clubby' feel is a bit 
stronger in here as several regular contributors are involved.. There 
seems to be a bit more in the netgrabs line, and a little less original 
material, although this may have been due to personal circumstances 
beyond Bob's control.. The basic form of Kelstar would seem to be well 
established now, although we wonder if there are one or two little 
surprises in the future??

ÅSummary:- Now brand spanking new STOS-based custom shell.. Roughly bi-
monthly, but we're not perfect in that regard either.. Falcon 
compatible if booted from 'Backward'.. One D/S disk.. Articles, a wide 
mixture, some netgrabs, but not too much detail on the computing side.. 
Prospects, a steady future catering for their corner of the scene, 
and some general appeal..

ÑOverall, seven out of ten..
Ö

ÅDiskmag News..
(And all the best rumours here too!)


ST+ to 'Double Up'..

The Northampton-based publication 'ST+' is to expand onto a second 
double sided disk, bringing back distant memories of Maggie issue 3.. 
This emergency provision for a second disk was made necessary by the 
sheer weight of text and graphical data aimed at this publication.. 
Only time will tell whether this is an emergency one-off feature, or if 
future issues after issue 11 will also be double disk as well..

A preview of issue 11 (Late Nov release) was recently seen with an 
'Elvira' style main menu, although we're not 100% sure if this will be 
part of the final release at time of writing.. (Yes it did..)

(Issue 12 reverted back to a single disk edition..)
Å

Falcon Update singed by back burner horror..

The recently speculated revival of Falcon Update Digital by John 
'VoGue' Nott has been scaled down to the 'sometime' category.. Various 
things have got in the way of an early appearance of this mag.. School 
work commitments and a new bulletin board have had to come first.. 
Also, the version of the custom shell refers rather heavily to the 
defunct Falcon Owners Group.. John does not have the full source code, 
and the person who did the program and who would have to change the 
shell is difficult to get hold of.. Go figure..


'Fun' still having a good time.. 

The DBA offshoot 'Fun' is still on the cards, although going slowly.. 
new article creation seems to be the bottleneck (as so often is the 
case..) Anyone wishing to help out should check out the new address for 
'Fun' in the diskmags guide (section 2)..


Polish your Polish!

Scanty news of a new Polish scene Falcon(?) diskmag starting to 
appear.. This has a spring '97 release date.. More info to follow 
soon.. Initial reports indicate that a good knowledge of the Polish 
language might be needed to appreciate it.. (Source, Mr Pink)


Undercover break from cover..

The team behind the German scene diskmag Undercover have broken a long 
silence to come up with a Xmas special issue, with more regular issues 
planned for the not too distant future.. Hopefully I'll be getting my 
hands on a copy before this issue of Maggie goes to press, for a more 
detailed evaluation.. Watch this space.. 

Er, that's quite enough for now..

CiH - Various in '96


**Late Review special!**

ÅUndercover issue 7

And as Xmas breaks, this German based scene 'zine arrives in the nick 
of time..

Undercover Mag has had a bit of a history on the ST, the inspiration of 
the editor, Eric Henschler, or Moondog of The Naughty Bytes.. It set 
out to take part in the part of the diskmag scene occupied by the likes 
of Maggie and DBA Mag, seemed to 'die' for a time, but has gone 
'undead' with two new issues since its death, with a third planned for 
the not too remote future.. 

The version we have got is in fact the preview of the 'full' version.. 
This one seems to have all the article texts in place, but a 
considerably simplified main menu and shell program, where the text 
displayer seems to be doing both jobs and is only kept apart by a 
single mouse click.. Previous issues had a DBA-like main menu, from 
whence you selected the articles.. Still, the main menu/text displayer 
is a nice one, with a combined mouse/keyboard interface.. It includes 
some options such as a font switcher, background colour inverter, and 
(temporarily disabled) print function for articles.. What graphics 
there are live at the top and bottom of the menu, and look quite good.. 
Music is rather nice, with some sort of modfile playing on the Falcon, 
and a decent soundchip tune for the ST..

The menu is pretty slick at the loading/scrolling down game, and runs 
even more quickly from hard disk, although it fits comfortably in, and 
runs from a standard double density floppy disk.. This Falcon, at 
least, was not too happy when I quit the program, as it locked up and 
the soundtrack stuttered, necessitating a prompt reboot..

Article-wise, Undercover was always known previously as an exclusively 
German language magazine.. This issue is welcome for the large number 
of English articles, including all the important news related ones.. 
There isn't a lot of really new news and a lot of what is there are 
mainly lamentations about departing people, some party results from 
non-Atari events, plentiful BBS adverts, a mixture of reviews, 
including an intriguing preview of Cannon Fodder II for the ST and 
Falcon, not an official Sensible Software project, needless to say, but 
a freelance effort by a heroic individual which has already reached the 
preview stage.. TNB have also been active on a demo for the ST and 
Falcon as well, and we hope to bring you more news on that for next 
Maggie.. Also, Tony Greenwood's summer release, Heartlands, gets the 
thumbs up from the Undercover team..

Several other articles come in later one.. A few shortish stories, a 
section by the 'Suicide Commando' which has an online point of origin 
and may have been previously seen in 'Pure Bollocks' Diskmag.. I get 
the impression that Undercover are a little short on material in 
certain areas, although they have promised to put that right for issue 
8, and have appealed for general help.. (If anyone is interested in 
contacting Undercover, their address is given in their entry in the 
Diskmag Encyclopdaedia..) 

Generally, Undercover Mag is a rarity these, days, an unabashed 'scene' 
zine, and there aren't too many of us left.. For that reason 
particularly, it is well worth supporting, and with any luck, and a bit 
of help, they should be ready with issue 8 for the Easter weekend..

ÅSummary:- Fairly simple but custom written shell, maybe 'full' shell 
waiting in wings? Irregular release dates, maybe only 2-3 issues a 
year? Falcon compatible, and enhanced in one area, but not without 
bugs.. One D/S disk.. Articles, mixture of languages, and a little 
sparse on content at the moment, but this will get better.. Prospects, 
good, but ultimately depends on the wider Atari Scene really.. 

ÑOverall, about seven and a half out of ten..

 And that *really* is it from me!!
