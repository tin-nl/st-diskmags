Welcome to the Ultimate Electric Boogaloo Guide to all things funky.

            Here we shall explore the exploits and the
                 attributes of the little large ones who go by

Dancin' Boogaloo Funksters were the result of a freak experiment, when

     A rythm that danced along the sounds of time, a rythm that moved,
  that echoed,
       with the beating in their hearts and the heaving of their souls.

 . . . that eventually led to the high priest of Boogie.

       ]         The high priest was often regarded as a strange,
     /\ \        obscure and somewhat eccentric man.
    (@@)|
     \//         Many would put this down to his size as he was,
     /\          indeed, and for no apparent reason other than a
    /  \         mark of authority, considerably larger than the
    \   |        other Boogaloo'ers.
    [  / \
      /   \      When asked, the high priest scratched his head
      \   /      in confusion to the prospect of The Land Of Funk
    __@   @__    being totally booged out.  Or de-funked, if you will.


       He scratched and scratched until his head                  ]
       became very sore.  He scratched his head               /\  /
       so much, in fact, that he had to then resort        /\(@@)/
       to scratching elsewhere about his person to        [  \\//
       state his confusion.  And then, and only then,         /
       did he put his finger on it.                           \
                                                               |/\
       It seems that Boogie and Boogie alone does not         /   \ /
       a happy Boogaloo'er make, because they, like          /     @
       all other red-blooded beings, had desires of          \@
       their own.                                           _/

You see,  all  the  inhabitants  in  The  Land  Of  Funk  were,  due to
circumstances beyond control,  male.   And  thankfully  the  thought of
social pleasures with one another  beyond  dancing disgusted the little
large ones, so the high priest had work to do, once again.

                         <:- - * - * - * - -:>


   /\        So, the high priest gathered all the loose commas,

   \// *-/\  set to work at creating something new.  Something special.

The grand unveiling was an extravagant affair, with streamers, balloons
and ice lollies for the little ones.   But saying this, there was still
a large amount of confusion  among  the Boogaloo'ers, with a spectating
Pac-Man looking very worried indeed,  until someone kindly explained to
him that the objects on stage were merely tilting sheets.

        And then the big moment came

   horizon on the plain of The Land Of Funk and all the people there
    continue on there quest to adjust their stance to dance, prance and
  appear on the occasional text-file header with their new-found
   companions.
        Shame that they're always to be restricted to just dancing
  together, really.....   Shame the high priest never thought to give
      any of them sexual organs.....
