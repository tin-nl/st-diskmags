After Escape's "illness at night", New beat get on the disease tip and
bring us a 4k intro entitled  "flu".  This  seems  an apt name as I am
currently suffering with  a  blocked  nose  and  a  hacking cough (not
related to late night MonST sessions!)

In the 'good old days',  expectation  for  a  4ktro was low. They were
single  screen  affairs  with  simple  effects   -  I  remember  a  4k
competition at  a  German  party  that  specifically  disallowed multi
screen intros.

But now the effects previously  seen  on  4k intros are being squeezed
into 128 bytes. Dead Hackers Society  upped  the ante with their genre
defying '4-ever' and '4mention'. Now a 4ktro  is seen as a demo in its
own right,  multiple  effects,  graphics,  design  and  we  have  even
recently seen the introduction of music into these compact intros.

As is customary  with  New  Beat  releases,  'flu'  has  had a mammoth
gestation period. We first heard  about  it  at  the  Alt party in the
spring, and Thomas has been tinkering away with it over the summer. We
are all aware of New Beat's talent and we were quite prepared to wait.

As with their previous 4ktro, 'Blue', New Beat have managed to squeeze
some gorgeous graphics into this intro. The demo opens with a glorious
'Flu' logo which is as good  as  anything  created in photoshop. A New
Beat logo of similar quality follows.

The first effect is a tunnel -  don't fall asleep, this isn't the same
effect that has been flogged to death  by  DHS - this one has a twist.
In fact it has a lot of  twists  - twisting shading lines that fly out
from the middle of the screen. A breath of fresh air in a stale genre.

Rippling water laps onto  our  screen  in  an  effect  which was first
brought to our attention in  Avena  &  Digital Chaos's legendary Fried
Bits 3 demo. This  is  not  up  the  same  standard  as the ripples in
Escape's recent "illness at night" but is cool all the same.

The next effect is my personal  favourite  - a large texture map fills
the screen, conveying the  impression  of  a  landscape. Each scanline
moves at a different speed like a finely detailed parallax scroll.

And all too soon its over.  A  large  'The  End' logo is stretched and
sheared across the screen. This is  a simple but great looking effect,
complemented perfectly by the great graphics.

Whilst Flu doesn't quite reach the  high standards of the DHS efforts,
it is still on of the best 4k  intros.  It is the level of polish that
Ämakes it really stand out from the crowd, in this area New Beat are in
a class of their own. This is one type of "Flu" that you will be happy
to catch.
