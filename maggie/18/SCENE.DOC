[] PHENIX TO BE UNVEILED AT ATARI MESSE

The legendary new super-atari, the Phenix, will be shown for the first
time at the Atari  Messe  show  in  Neuss  Germany  on April 10th. The
Phenix has been in development for 2 years now and it the most eagerly
anticipated atari machine since the Falcon.

Centek have also changed  the  specs  of  the  machine.  There will no
longer be a 68040 model,  ALL  machines  will  be  fitted with a 68060
running at 80Mhz. The  DSP  has  also  been  speeded  up, the Phenix's
DSP563001 now runs at 100Mhz. Bus speeds have also been increased.

Members of the maggie team are very  eager  to get their hands on this
machine, and at least two of us  will definitely be buying Phenix's as
soon as they are  released.  The  Phenix  is  the  future of the Atari
scene.


[] MYSTIC BYTES MAKE AMIGA EMULATOR FOR FALCON

Polish demo kings "Mystic Bytes"  are  planning  an Amiga emulator for
the Falcon.  Wiz-Coder  Sqward  is  creating  an  emulator  capable of
running Amiga-OS and  compatible  applications.  This  is an ambitious
project, but at least both  machines  are  based  on the same CPU. The
difficulty will  come  in  emulating  the  custom  chips  and hardware
registers. Sqward is currently looking  into  the PMMU features of the
030 - this will allow him to emulate hardware registers without having
to trap every single read and write to memory.

It is unlikely that this  emulator  will  be  able to run the hardware
bashing Amiga demos, but  there  is  a  chance  that  some of the more
cleanly written amiga games may be able  to run. It would also be nice
to see some of the legendary  amiga  art  packages making their way to
the atari.

The main drawback with this project  is  that Sqward is not attempting
to emulate the copper, instead he will be emulating the graphics cards
that came with the  more  recent  amigas,  specifically the Cyberstorm
System.


[] DUNE GIVE US PARADISE

Dune have just released an  ST  intro!  'Paradise' was created back in
1995, but never released. The recent surge  in ST demos that has given
Äus 'Do Things' and 'Nostalgico' encouraged  Dune  to dig out their STs
and finally release this  production.  It's  a typically well designed
Dune intro with very  nice  graphics  that  works  on  both the ST and
Falcon.

Apparently Dune  also  have  a  2  disk  ST  megademo  that  was never
released. This was seen at the  Fried  Bits  3, but there were still a
few minor bugs to clean up.  Dune  are promising to release some other
stuff, so we may finally see this demo.


[] NEW BEAT RELEASE FLEX TRACKER

Willie creators New Beat  have  released  version  0.5 of their Falcon
Tracker 'FlexTrax'. It support  4,  6  and  8  channel MODs, and makes
extensive use of the DSP  for  effects  like  Reverb and Delay. Thomas
will be releasing the complete  replay  source  soon.  As with all New
Beat productions, FlexTrax looks great. It has the potential to be the
most popular tracker on the Falcon.


[] ERROR IN LINE 99

The atari scene are heading en masse to  the Error In Line 99 party in
Dresden over the Easter Weekend.  All  the  big  Players will be there
including organisers Checkpoint, Escape,  Dead Hackers Society, Mystic
Bytes, Fun, Mind Design, Cobra,  New  Beat  and  also the Maggie Team.
Like Siliconvention before it, this  party  should  see the release of
numerous demos and intros for the Falcon  and ST. Everyone seems to be
working on something so competition will be fierce.


[] EIL INTROS RELEASED

Two invite intros have been released  for  the EIL 99 party. The first
is by the organisers Checkpoint and runs on the ST. It features a nice
feedback effect on a fuji logo. DHS have created a Falcon intro with a
'rot zoomer' lake effect. To gain  access  to the hidden screen in the
DHS intro, press '5' and '*' on the text screen at the start.


[] CRACKMAN FOR EIL

Teenage are busy putting the  final  touches  to their pacman game for
the STe and Falcon  "Crackman".  Amongst  the  additions include a new
powerpill that lets you  eat  ghosts.  Currently  all  that is left to
finish are the intro  sequence  and  the  end  sequence.  They plan to
release the final version at EIL 99. Tinker.(there I mentioned you ;-)


[] OXYRON HAVE FUN

Legendary C64 and Amiga crew are  collaborating with FUN for their EIL
demo. The current team working on  this project are Earx (Code), Havoc
(Graphics), Dforce (Music) and Noxs/Oxyron  (Music). They are creating
a Falcon megademo which is said to  be 'huge'. Fungle Beats has proved
ÄFUN's demo capabilities, lets hope for something equally good at EIL.


[] PSX GRAPHICS RIPPER RELEASED

Patrice Mandin has  coded  a  graphics  ripper  for PlayStation games.
Provided you have a CD-Rom you are now able to steal graphics from PSX
games. Like the .PI1 on the ST and  .GOD  on the Falcon, the PSX has a
standard graphics format - the  .TIM.  This  ripper allows the reading
and conversion of TIM files from  PSX  CDs - handy for anyone planning
ports of PSX games!


[] OPEN GL HITS ATARI

MESA - a version of OpenGL, the popular 3D API, has been ported to the
Falcon. OpenGL is a library of  3D routines which allow programmers to
create 3D applications with ease and  speed.  It has proved popular on
the PC,  both  because  it  is  easier  to  program  than  Microsoft's
cumbersome Direct3D and  also  because  it  is  faster.  MESA has been
ported by some French guys using the LDG system (Library Dynamic GEM).
We hope to have a  full  report  into  this interesting API next issue
once we have figured out all the French documentation!


[] BINLINER SOURCE RELEASED

The 'Binliner' project may be consigned to the dustbin of history, but
Tat hasn't totally given up on  the  atari  scene. He has opened a new
section of his web page which  is specifically dedicated to this demo.
Here you can find executable  binaries  of  some  of the screens, full
source code for the demo and also  a range of utilities he created for
making the demo.

The DSP code and demo  o/s  should  be  useful  to any coders planning
Falcon demos. Currently documentation  of  the  routines is spare, but
Tat is planning to write a full set of support docs which will explain
how everything works and give people an insight into creating triple A
Falcon demos.


[] BUT IS IT ART?

The Black Lotus continue to  work  away  on their highly secretive new
falcon demo. We have been lucky enough  to  get our hands on a preview
and can say that it is  really  mind  blowing!  It can also be monitor
blowing; you are going  to  need  a  100hz  VGA  monitor  to see Art's
effects  in  their  full  glory.  The   demo  just  needs  some  minor
enhancements on the graphics  and  a  suitable  piece  of music before
being released.


[] VECTRONIX REORGANISE

Maggie  Chart  winners  "Vectronix"   are   undergoing   a  major  re-
organisation. Long standing  members  Metallinos  and  Phoenix  are to
Äleave the group. We will all  miss  them  greatly  as we have a lot of
respect for the work they have done over the years, both on the ST and
Falcon. But Vectronix are not dead, they will now by led by new member
SJX, a talented young coder  and  hacker.  Phoenix believes he bring a
lot of enthusiasm and fresh impetus  to  the  group. The future of the
much read 'VexNews' is unknown at this point.


[] HEXEN AND HERETIC HIT FALCON

Following on from his port of  ID's  DooM, French coder Patrice Mandin
is converting two more first person shooter  to the Falcon. He has got
hold of the source code to both Hexen and Heretic and is busy creating
Falcon versions of  both  of  them.  With  the  widespread adoption of
accelerators like the  Nemesis  and  Centurbo  2,  these  games have a
chance of running at a reasonable rate on these enhanced machines.


[] TEENAGE ANNOUNCE CIVILISATION CLONE

Crackman creators "Teenage" have  announced  the  plans for their next
game. "Politically Incorrect" will be  a civilisation clone. You start
at the dawn of  time  and  must  build  a  'great civilisation' (sound
familiar?). The game is  based  or  real archeological discoveries are
will incorporate "the most recent theories  about the history of man",
including details of the Maya and Egyptian civilisations.

Phenomenen has already coded  the  map  scrolling system which, unlike
the original game, runs  in  one  vbl!  Some  basic  AI  has also been
completed. Everybody loves civilisation, so  full marks to teenage for
embarking on such a cracking project.


[] ICQ COMES TO GEM

First there was IRC or "Internet Relay Chat". This allowed people with
internet connections to enter 'chat channels' and speak to like minded
people. Each channel had a topic,  and  the most popular channels with
Maggie readers are obviously #atari  and  #atariscne. The problem with
IRC is that you can only see  the  people  who are on the channels you
are connected to.

ICQ allows  you  to  talk  to  anyone  who  is  currently  running ICQ
software. Instead of having to log on  to channels, you have a hotlist
of your friends and you  can  see  when  they are connected and easily
start chatting to  them  without  waiting  for  them  to  log  on to a
specific channel.

ICQ has taken the PC world by storm,  and  looks set to do the same on
the atari. ST2DISK author,  Pascal  Nowit,  is  currently coding a Gem
version of ICQ - something that  is eagerly anticipated with all atari
users with a net connection.


[] EARX TAKES OVER QUICK DSP

ÄDevelopment of the 'Quick  DSP  Assembler', Audoly Giles's replacement
for the horrendously slow Motorola tools, has been taken up by EarX of
FUN. He has already released numerous  updates, fixed lots of bugs and
added a lot of features. It may  not  quite yet be as comprehensive or
reliable as the motorola assembler,  but  it  is amazingly fast and is
highly recommended to all Falcon coders.


[] MIND DESIGN PLAN EIL DEMO

Swedish coders Mind Design are working  on  a demo for the forthcoming
Error In Line 99 party. This  is  likely  to include routines from the
unfinished "Modest" 96ktro. Help may come  from New Beat coder Thomas.
The Viking is also planning to  buy  a  Net  Yaroze and write some psx
games.


[] NETWORKING MADE FUN

Fun are creating an Ethernet adaptor for  the Atari! At last we should
be able to have a  decent  and  reliable networking system. The system
will be based  around  an  Ethernet  10baseT  connection  giving you a
transfer rate of 10Mbit/s on the  TT  and Falcon. But ST owners aren't
going to be left behind  -  there  is  an  adaptor  being made for the
ST/STE and Mega series too.

This should  allow  you  to  access  networking  peripherals  such  as
printers and  modems,  easily  transfer  files  between  machines. You
should even be able to link your atari up to PC and Mac networks!

This is a  brave  project,  and  a  working  ethernet connection would
surely be worth their asking price of  135 euros. It is still in early
stages of development, but it is a project well worth supporting.


[] DHS PLAN ST MEGADEMO

Super-league winners DHS are planning to  raise their status on the ST
by creating an ST mega  demo  for  EIL  99. Although their previous ST
productions such as  'Massacre'  and  'DHS  Porno'  hardly  pushed the
machine to the limits, they are  now  older and wiser and could really
do something special.

According to  inside  sources,  the  effects  will  includes  such DHS
standards as tunnels, bump mapping  and  rot  zoomers. Perhaps we will
get to hear the YM abilities  of  Toodeloo! Graphics are being painted
by Edo of Sector One.


[] THINKING SILLY

Silly Software have just unveiled  their  latest  game. "Thinker" is a
puzzle game for the  ST  and  Falcon.  It  was  originally designed by
Stosser Software, but  Silly  then  took  over  devlopment  with Deano
coding it to completion. Expect a full review in the next issue.

Ä
[] CREAM DOING MORE THINGS

Cream are not  resting  on  their  laurels.  Following  the superb "Do
Things", Candyman is back on devpac  coding effects. Although not much
is yet complete, he hopes  to  have  another  ST demo released for the
Error In Line party. If it's half as good as "Do Things" we are in for
another treat!

Candyman is also buying a Falcon.  He  is already teaching himself DSP
assembly language. Given the quality  of  his  ST demos, a Falcon demo
from Cream could be quite stunning.


[] EQUINOX ANNOUNCE NEW MEGADEMO

More nostalgia from France as another  old ST demo crew announce their
plans to release a  mega  demo.  The  creators  of  "Eat My Bollocks",
Equinox, are working on "Virtual  Escape",  a demo that was originally
coded back in  1993,  but  was  never  completed.  Just  about all the
screens are finished, Keops just  needs  to  write the loading system.
Work will re-commence on this production on March 19th.


[] VIDEL CRACKED

The search for a perfect video  library  for the Falcon continues. The
Videl chip has the advantage  of  being  highly flexible, but this can
also be a disadvantage when trying  to  exactly restore screen mode on
exiting a demo. Sage of Escape  has  developed a very clever system of
Videl routines which appear to work  perfectly in all Falcon modes and
even cope with speeders such as  Nemesis  and  Blow-Up. Evil of DHS is
just about to release a video  library  containing these routines - no
longer will we have  to  endure  horrible  monitor  sync problems when
quitting a demo or game.


[] NOSTALGICO RELEASE

It was like the 'good old days' - an ace ST megademo was released with
a spanking full screen  main  menu  and  lots  of  cool effects hidden
behind doors.  Oxygene  finally  completed  their  eagerly anticipated
'Nostalgic-O' demo and it has definitely been worth the wait. From the
amazing 3D in  the  intro  to  the  super  smooth  main  menu  and the
overlander's texture mapping screen, this  is  an  ST demo that puts a
lot of Falcon releases in the shade.


[] COBRA BITE BACK

There is plenty of activity in the  Polish scene at the moment. Cobra,
who split last year with  some  members  joining the Atari division of
Whelpz, have re-organised. Mayonez has left whelpz and rejoined Cobra.
They also now have the services of Poland's number 1 graphist, Vulgar,
who was kicked out  of  the  Mystic  Bytes  by  Grey. Expect some more
releases to follow 'Generation Gap'.
Ä
The future doesn't look so bright  for Whelpz atari division which has
been reduced to just  Macgyver.  His  Falcon  is  broken  and it looks
unlikely that we will see anything from Whelpz for some time.


[] SYNTAX TERROR

Despite rumours to the  contrary,  Syntax  are  still active on Atari.
Klocek has just bought a Falcon so  maybe we will see 'Sometime Falcon
flies higher than bumblebee!' At  the  moment  Yoyo  is very busy with
school, but it shouldn't be long  before  this  great coder is back on
devpac.

Meanwhile  Klocek  is  working   on   a   new   atari  diskmag  called
"underground" which will incorporated "player mag". This will again be
mainly in Polish, but  we  hope  for  some  English  articles. Eros is
helping to write some articles.


[] SUPREMACY BURN CDS

French coders Supremacy are busy creating  a series of CD-Roms for the
atari. These will contain  a  complete  collection  of  all the Falcon
demos and intros ever released.  Razaac  is  also planning to make CDs
full of ROMs for emulators  -  handy  for  RG  if they are seeking new
releases for GBX or GodleNES!


[] FUN PARTY

Dutch party-animals, FUN, are planning a  demo party in the summer. It
will be held in Utrecht, Holland,  from  the  28th July to 4th August.
People already planning to  attend  include  members  of Mystic Bytes,
Poets of Decay, TSCC, Popsy  Team,  Wildfire, Sentry, Teenage and some
of the Maggie Team.


[] CENTURBO II RELEASED

French hardware wizards, Centek, have finally completed their Centurbo
2 upgrade board. Unlike the Centurbo  1 and Nemesis, this board really
gives the Falcon a large kick up the ass


[] FATBOY SLIM "YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, ATARI"

Fatboy Slim is currently  riding  high  in  all  the charts around the
earth (and possibly  other  planets)  with  tracks  like 'Rockerfeller
Skank', 'Gangster Trippin' and 'Praise You'. It is interesting to find
that all his tunes are composed on a humble ST, proving you don't need
500mhz processors and  overly  complex  new  software  to create chart
topping tunes. Nice one, Norman.


[] COBRA BRIDGE GENERATION GAP
Ä
The recent internal split in Polish demo crew Cobra has seemed to make
some of its members more  active.  The  first  fruit of this increased
motivation is 'Generation Gap', released at  the Last Party in Poland.
Although not up to the  standards  of  the  top  Falcon demos, it is a
promising start, especially  considering  it  was  coded  by  a former
graphist and swapper! What next, Grey starts DSP coding?


[] SENDMAIL COMES TO ATARI

Assemsoft coder OZK is busy porting SendMail to the atari. This is the
de facto mailing program on linux systems, and OZK hopes to bring this
package to atari users with multi-tasking operating systems.


[] HD DRIVER 7.7

HD Driver, the de facto hard  drive  driver  (bit of a mouthful that!)
has reached version 7.7 and its gleaming with features such as:

* Supports Atari SH/Megafiles, SCSI1/SCSI2/SCSI3/Ultra-SCSI, IDE/EIDE,
  Ultra-DMA and Atapi drives.
* Runs on every atari including Hades, Medusa and Milan.
* Works on all kinds of drives including Zip, Jaz, SyQuest, EZ, LS120
  and even DVD-RAM
* There is no upper limit for drive capacity!
* Special functions for ZIP and JAZ drives
* Automatic secure recognition of media changes
* Support for Dos/Windows compatible partitioning
* Long filename support
* Non Blocking DMA transfers with MagiC

With such an impressive array of  functions,  it  is no wonder that HD
Driver has become so popular. It  will  be interesting to see how well
Centek's HD Driver "Cecile" can compete.


[] RG SHARPEN THEIR AXES

Whilst all else around us seem  to  be losing their heads, RG increase
their headcount by unveiling some new contributors. Entering the games
industry hasn't turned RG against the  atari,  in  fact it has had the
opposite effect with RG members enlisting  the  help of members of the
games industry for  future  productions.  Already  one  of  the coders
behind Colin McRae Rally has been  helping to optimize one of MrPink's
intros. Andy Debus, who worked on the PlayStation game Chill, has been
painting graphics for RG. Most exciting  of  all,  we have a new coder
who goes by the rather frightening name  of 'Axeman'. He is demo coder
from the C64 and Amiga scene who used to be in Fairlight.


[] ARMEGEDDON IT

Mind Design continue  to  work  on  their  Worms  game  for the Falcon
"Armegeddon". The pace of development has slowed down since Christmas,
Äbut Deez still hopes to finish this project. The specs are impressive,
with everything running at 50fps in true colour on VGA and RGB.


[] JAG BREEDS NEW DOOM CLONE

A new breed of Jaguar games are being developed. Renowned Lynx and Jag
coder, Carl Forham, has  got  hold  of  the  Doom  source  code and is
planning his own first  person  game.  Already some optimisations have
been made allowing the engine to  run  at  twice the resolution in the
same rate. The game planned is entitled "The Breeders" and is based on
a Role Playing Game.  It  should  be  something  for game-starved jags
users to look forward to.


[] POPSY PARTY

French crew Popsy Team are organising a demo party for the summer. The
VIP party will be held in  St  Priest,  near Lyon, France, from 2nd to
4th of July. This may be  a  good  alternative from the Volcanic party
which has gone very pc-oriented (see review by edo/sector one).


[] NEW DEMO ARCHIVE OPENS

Tommy of the Comic Pirates is helping  to  set up a huge new demoscene
related site which will contain  atari  relevant material. Here is the
information he sent us:

 The TRebel archive will become a huge archive of demoscene-related
 stuff, like demos and music. It contains more than 9 gigabytes of
 data, and will at least have 5 mirrors.

 TRebel is _not_ a crew. We, the staff, come from different crews
 worldwide.

 Our only working mirror is atm ftp://hu.trebel.org (hungary) and
 still under construction. The idea of TRebel came when The Hornet
 archive was closing. But Hornet was only supporting stuff for PC
 while we also will support Atari etc.

 The archive should be working completely in the middle of this year,
 meanwhile you can contact us at feedback@trebel.org


[] NEW TEENAGE MEMBER

Drug-crazed Dutchies, Teenage, have  recruited  a  new member from the
UK. "Beerserker" will  be  responsible  mainly  for  playtesting their
releases but also hopes to  start  programming  on future releases. He
also has a comedy name.


[] DBE PLAYER 2.03

Sector One have released a new version of their 'DBE PLAYER'. Not only
Ähave there been a number of bugfixes,  there are also additions to the
playlist.


[] LYNX SFX

Atari Lynx programmers may be  interested  in a sound programming tool
created by Carl Forham. "SFX"  allows  you  to  get  to grips with the
Lynx's complex audio chip through an intuitive GUI.

"SFX" gives you full access  to  all  four  channels of Lynx audio and
also all the audio  registers.  You  can  also  tinker  with the audio
registers when mixing one or  more  channels.  When you are happy with
your sound, you can  dump  it  out  and  include  it  straight in your

program. This saves the hassle of messing around with sound effects in
your code and having to recompile every time you need to test.


[] PSX2 ANNOUNCED

Although this is not strictly atari  news,  the release of the PSX2 is
an event  of  significance  to  all  computer  users.  The  specs  are
incredible - not only does it wipe the floor with the dreamcast but it
even  blows  away  top  end  PCs   and  even  competes  with  graphics
workstations. This could mark a  sea-change  in the computer landscape
with less and less people buying  PCs  to  play games, this could also
threaten the sales of 3D card  manufacturers.  Perhaps in 5 years time
it will not be Intel/Microsoft holding a monopoly but Sony.

For full details of this machine, see elsewhere in this issue.


[] BATTLESPHERE BATTLES FOR RELEASE

The future of 4Play's Jaguar  game "Battlesphere" is currently hanging
in the balance. Despite the demise of atari, 4Play continued to create
this ambitious 3D shooter.  To  press  their  game onto cartridge they
need the permission of Hasbro (who recently bought Atari from JTS) and
an encryption key. Hasbro seem  less  than  keen to help 4play release
their game. It would be a real shame if this game doesn't get released
due to corporate red tape.


[] THALION TRIBUTE PAGE OPENS

Alex Holland has opened  a  set  of  pages  dedicated to the legendary
games company 'Thalion'. They were famous  for employing demo coders -
mainly members of the Union -  and  getting  them  to make some of the
most technically stunning  games  on  the  ST.  The  Thalion page will
feature downloadable versions of all Thalion games. Ever wondered what
Nic of TCB looked like? Well you  can  find out in the gallery section
that has snapshots of  many  thalion  members.  There  will also be CV
section which lists all Thalion  members  productions and a 'where are
they now' bit, as Alex tracks down  the current location of the former
thalion heads. Check it out at http://thalion.atari.org
Ä

[] REEKING RUBBER ENHANCEMENTS

Not a week goes by without Nature  adding some extra features to their
racing game "Reeking Rubber". Now  that  both Instream and Hencox have
Falcons, development should speed  up.  They  have  also just bought a
Centurbo 2 board and got the game running on this - it does 30fps!

New features  in  Reeking  Rubber  include  the  addition  of tunnels,
improved  texture  mapping  with  atmospheric  shading,  environmental
effects such as snow and rain and  also a multiplayer mode! This works
over a STING network which should allow you to play over the internet.
You can also link  falcons  together  with  MIDI  leads  or null modem
cables. Its about time we had an alternative to midi maze!

Nature will be showing off the latest version of Reeking Rubber at the
Error In Line party.


[] STNICC 2000

Richard Karsmakers, editor of the sadly  missed ST News, is organising
a huge atari party for the  year  2000.  This will celebrate the tenth
anniversary of the legendary  ST  News  international Christmas Coding
Convention. Richard hopes to attract  lots  of  members  of the old ST
demo scene to this party, including TEX, The Carebears, The Lost Boys,
ULM, Legacy, Overlanders, TNT Crew,  ST CNX and Delta Force.

The party will be held from  December  15th  - December 20th so if you
want to meet some of the  most  famous  crews from the atari scene get
sorting out your diaries! Richard Karsmakers can be contacted at:
 cronos@atari.org


[] CODE STAR AWARD

Mr Pink of Reservoir  Gods  has  received  a  Code  Star award for his
contribution to the atari scene. The Code Star awards have been set up
by Karen and Terry Ross  and  reward  people  who  have worked hard to
support the current atari  scene.  Mr  Pink  would  like  to thank the
organisers of this award and the people who nominated him.


[] PIE BILL GATES

If you enjoyed seeing those crazy  belgians covering Mr Microsoft with
goo, now is the chance to  relive  the  experience from the comfort of
your own armchair. Pie-crazed Frenchies, Sector  One, are working on a
new game that will allow  you  to,  quite literally, 'Pie Bill Gates'.
The Pie is the limit!


[] RESERVOIR JOBS

Will wonders never cease?  Some  members  of  RG  have  managed to get
Äthemselves jobs and will no longer spend their days dodging university
lessons and sleeping through all the daylight hours.

MrPink was first to be  roped  into  the  world  of employment. He now
works  for  a  games  company  in  Oxfordshire  programming  the  Sony
Playstation. His  is  currently  writing  the  graphics  engine  for a
football game entitle "UEFA  Champions  League  2000".  It  is due for
release next april.

Being such a nice chip, MrPink  recommended  the talents of MSG to his
company and they have  also  employed  him!  MSG  now  works as a lead
tester on a strategy game called  "War Monkeys" which will be released
on the Dreamcast and PC. He  is  also  coding some AI routines. Aren't
these musicians versatile?

Neither MrPink nor MSG has "quit  the  scene", they haven't sold their
Falcons and they are not buying PCs. They may have less time for their
atari activities but they are still as  keen as ever. And they will be
investing their new found wealth in spanking new Centek Phenixs.
