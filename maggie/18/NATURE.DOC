Although Nature have been programming  on  the Falcon since 1996, they
have only recently sprung to prominence with releases of their texture
mapped Lotus Clone "Reeking Rubber".

Hencox and Instream  form  the  Atari  division  of  the Swedish group
"Nature". They are based in Gothenburg and develop Falcon games - from
humble STOS beginning to the  current  030  and DSP bashing of Reeking
Rubber.

There homepage is frames based. On logging  on you see a menu bar down
a narrow vertical panel on  the  left,  whilst  the  right side of the
window contains information about nature.

The only problem with this system is that you have to have graphics on
to access the links in the menu bar, there is no alternative text.

Like most Swedish pages, the  whole  thing  is well designed and looks
very professional. The graphics are  nice  without being over bearing.
An animated nature  logo,  looking  very  like  a  small  demo effect,
wibbles around in the bottom left corner.

Lets surf the page.

 NEWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the section you are  most  likely  to check out. Nature's news
takes the form of a diary and  is  presented  as a table with dates on
the left and 'happenings' on the  right.  This is a neater design than
some other homepage diaries we have seen.

The entries are reasonable concise,  but  convey  a lot of interesting
information. There is not the  aimless  rambling  that seems to infest
other diaries, and there is also  quite a lot of technical information
which is something coders really enjoy reading.

You can follow the story of  Nature's  Centurbo  2 board - despite all
the problems it seems  Centek  were  helpful.  You  can read about the
ongoing development of Reeking  Rubber  and  their  plans for Error In
Line.

Although not updated ever day,  this  news section is maintained often
enough to make it worth checking  regularly. The stuff that is written
is always interesting, there's not much  of the "we didn't actually do
anything today" type entries. Full marks!
Ä

 PROJECTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find out about all  Nature's projects. And you may not be
surprised to learn that none of them have actually been completed yet!


The first project is  "Lands  Of  Fantasy",  something  we previewed a
couple of issues ago.  This  is  Role  Playing  Game  in  the style of
HeroQuest, but instead of relying  on  isometric bitplane graphics, it
actually renders each  screen  as  you  walk  into  it!  Everything is
texture mapped and there is also light sourcing from torches. It saves
the rendered image to hard drive to prevent any wait when returning to
the screen. A neat idea.

The game itself was ambitious, with  37  different types of spell, 200
different weapons to collect  and  200  different  pieces of armour to
wear. There was also  the  possibility  to  have 65135 different items
(hmm, add up these numbers and you  get 0x10000 - what a coincidence!)
which could range from healing potions to magic wands.

Like heroquest, the game was  turned  based,  with  you making a move,
then all the monsters moving.  This  could  be  a very interesting and
involving game, and is certainly  unlike  anything we've currently got
on the Falcon.

Next up is "Megablast" a shoot-em-up, but not the Bitmap brothers one.
You may be alarmed to learn that  Megablast was written mainly in STOS
- come back! Its not  so  bad,  it  does  run  in  320x240 mode in 256
colours and achieves a framerate of 50fps.

There were plans for some cunning alien  AI and also some nice weapons
such as seeking missiles and plasma  beams. Although the engine is 99%
complete, it is unlikely that this game will be finished.

"Reeking Rubber" we  know  already.  There  have  been  some very nice
enhancements to this game since version 0.9 , the most noticable being
the addition of 8 player multiplayer mode using STING. This will allow
you to race against friends over the internet!

All  these  projects  have  detailed  information  about  them  and  a
selection of screenshots to view.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 DOWNLOAD
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone wants to leech warez from pages,  and heres your grab and run
point. There are  some  downloads  here  that  aren't  featured in the
projects section.

"Battle" is a strategy game for  GEM. You basically move some counters
around a grid attempting to attack enemy counters. Not Nature's finest
hour.
Ä
There is a preview version  of  "Lands  Of  Fantasy" to download. This
will render up some rooms for you  and you can see the texture mapping
and light sourcing on the  torches.  The  engine looks very promising,
but there is not much in the way of gameplay here.

A utility to download is  a  "Height  Field Creator for POV". Although
written in assembly, it is apparently "very slow".

More useful is the "Shell for assembling DSP files". Take the pain out
running all the motorola  utilities!  Well  worth  checking out if you
intend to tackle the strange beast known as the 56001.

There is a  very  early  version  of  the  Shoot-Em-Up  "Megablast" to
download here. Unfortunately it  seems  to  be  headed  for the Falcon
shoot-em-up graveyard along with "Panium Disaster" and "X-Moon".


This is what most people  are  here  for  -  a downloadable version of
"Reeking Rubber". The current version on the  page  is 0.9 , and a lot
has changed since them. Hopefully we  will  see  a new version for the
EIL party.

So a good selection of previews, games and utilities here.

 NATURE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find  out  information  about  the  members of Nature. It
seems that the  Amiga  division  is  larger  than  the Atari division.
Musician C-Frog is actually a member of the Amiga division.

There are links here to  the  homepages  of  some  of the other nature
members. This section could have benefited from some pictures of the
members, if only for us to laugh at their strange Swedish faces.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 FTP LINKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is links section of the  page,  but  you  won't find any links to
other atari crews or any other web pages for that matter. Its strictly
FTP links only.

There are links here to some of  the most popular atari ftp sites, the
French  lip6  site,  and   the   German   uni-kl  and  berline  sites.
Surprisingly there is no funet.fi link.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nature have created a decent web-page. Not only is it good looking, it
is easy to navigate, contains good  information and lots of downloads.
My main criticism of it  is  its  reliance  on  having graphics on. It
would also be good if they included more programming material on their
page.
Ä
If you want to  check  out  one  of  the  most interesting development
diaries on the net, then their news  page  is well worth a visit. It's
hard to resist the call of Nature.
