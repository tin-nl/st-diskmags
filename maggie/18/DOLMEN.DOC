Back once again! The article that  usually  does a good job of writing
itself is floundering  this  issue,  mainly  due  to  my  IRC log file
becoming too big and corrupting itself.

Usually  this  can  provide  use   with  quite  literally  minutes  of
entertainment with the comedy  misspelling  and  typing errors. How we
laughed!

The only small amount of  humour  that  could  be salvaged involved an
exchanged between comedy-hating mystic  byter,  grey,  and exam loving
sector one member, exyl.

                                * * *

Grey was disappointed to learn that Exyl  could not make Error In Line
due to having to sit exams (schools these days eh!)

<_grey> exyl: there is no other party we would meet us :(

We all knew that grey was larger  than life, but little did we realise
he was a 'legion' style entity composed of many enthusiastic poles. We
will bid them all farewell

<_grey> okay, have to leave yet

                                * * *

We all know that  Felice  is  funny.  But  is  he,  erm, funny? Well a
budding career in alternative comedy  beckons  as the Spowart dons his
comedy hat and reveals his previous hidden comedy talents.

Let's let the great man explain:


 Here's an updated version of one of my articles for Maggie 27.
 There is also a pic included - that pokes heavy sarcasm at Mr Pink -
 but I think I deserve a pop at him after what he did about me in
 Maggie 26 ! ;)

 Anyway, if you can include these, that would be great.


So hold on to your sides, and click on the 'pic' button.

 ....

ÄOK, you can wipe the tears of laughter from your eyes now.

It might help if someone explained  to  Felice what 'sarcasm' was, I'm
surprised that man of such  education,  learning and wit didn't notice
that his picture contained little sarcasm. (note: sarcasm).

Chris Morris and Steve  Coogan  may  be  forced  to retire from comedy
after seeing the  new  standards  of  humour  Felice  has reached. The

picture is so funny, it should be  made illegal. It is like the lethal
joke in Monty Python - it reaches dangerous levels of humour.

A psychologist examining the picture may be disturbed.
The crazed and  erratic  handwriting.  The  inability  to  write  in a
straight line. The vast variation  between  letter  sizes. The lack of
judgement of distances leading to  frantic  squashing  of text size as
the border of  the  picture  approaches.  The  inability  to  use text
functions in an art package. The judicious use of exclamation marks.

These would be considered to be classic  examples of a patient who is,
erm, slightly disturbed. If we had been sent this anonymously we would
be worried, thank god it  was  from  Felice  -  someone who we know is
completely sane and normal.

So enjoy the brilliant  'sarcasm'.  Just  one  slight  error - I don't
actually work for Sony. Despite  that,  its hilarious. We look forward
to more felice-based humour next  issue,  in  a column we are creating
entitled "Felice's Funnies".

                                * * *

Perhaps on the atari scene we are  a little spoiled. We are accustomed
to having users with high levels  of  technical competence. There is a
large proportion of atari users  who  not  only  know the software and
operating system inside out, they can  actually program it. They don't
sort out bugs by calling a  PC-Helpline, they disassemble the programs
and find out what is causing the errors.

On the PC things are  very  different.  When  MSG  was working on a pc
helpline he had many calls  from  people  who  should never be allowed
within 10 miles of any sort of computer equipment. One of the best was
the lady who called up and said she  had broken the "cup holder in her
pc".

In the olden days we had  'lamers'.  Then  they all bought PCs. But it
seems they we may have, to  use  the old terminology, another lamer in
our midst.

Email, that wonderful  invention,  brings  us  into  contact with many
weird and wonderful people who have stumbled across our homepage. This
is the message we received from one of them:

 I have the gameboy emulator.I am not sure if godboy games will work
 on my emulator because when ever I download a game it becomes a zip
 file. The zip files do not work or run on any circumstances.Please
 give me a solution so I could download some games off of your site.
Ä
 Sincerely,
 Sender

Not only is this person unable to  enter  his name into a dialogue box
marked 'sender', but they are also  completely baffled by the rare and
unusual invention known only as  the  'zip'  file. These strange files
don't run if you double click on them! Maybe my computer is broken?

                                * * *

Are you stupid? Do you have a  habit  of saying the wrong thing at the
wrong time? Is  your  grasp  of  the  English  language  poor? Are you
confused by ZIP files? Do you 'bear  the scars'? If so, please drop us
a line so we can cynically use your  text to form a comedy article for
other people to laugh at.
