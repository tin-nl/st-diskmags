'Motion' is one of those  Falcon  productions that enjoyed 'Holy Grail
Status'. Those who had seen it whispered about in hushed tones, it was
a potential Eko-Lazer-Avena beater. But like EKO's game, Griff's music
program, 'Boom' and 'Space Junk' it looked likely to forever reside in
the unfinished directory.

During the Alt party we  had  plenty  of  chance to chat to Aggression
about prospects for the release of this demo. Setok was pretty keen to
let it loose on the  populous.  Wiztom  muttered about 'having all the
source zipped up on his  PC  drive'  and  besides  he was busy writing
games for Bloodhouse.

As the months  progressed  the  chances  of  this  ever being released
seemed to diminish. Then, out of the blue, a large file named 'Motion'
arrived on the DHS pages.

Before you get too excited, this  is  not  a release of the full demo.
Instead it is a release  of  all  the  source code and associated data
files - Wiztom's intention was  that  someone  else would sit down and
finish it. Fortunately he also included executable binaries of all the
screens.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 ANIM
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This was obviously created as the  intro  for the demo. The large file
size immediately gives  away  the  fact  that  this  is  some  sort of
animation (the filename being the other, more damning clue). A texture
mapped spins across the  screen,  each  side  of  bearing  a letter of
'MOTION' which it stamps into the background.

This is a well designed introduction  that  would have set the tone of
the demo nicely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
BEZIER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The killer effect of the demo is  a  killer bee - or more accurately a
wasp. Yes, the famous aggression flying insect has come to life in 3D!

When people released how  good  the  DSP  was  at matrix calculation a
whole series of dot  based  rotating  objects  were unleashed onto the
Falcon public. As demo effects go,  they gave Mandlebrot screens a run
for their money in the dullness stakes.

Aggression show what can be done with dots  with a bit of design and a
Äbit of imagination. A wasp  built  entirely  of dots flaps and rotates
its way around the screen and  it  looks great. Tap the functions keys
and the wasp will morph into a more traditional torus.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPLOT
----------------------------------------------------------------------


This screen reminds me of the 'Geranium Demo', specifically the screen
where a large strand of  blobs  rotates  around. ( great description -
ED). Here we have some 3D shade bobs that rotate around the y axis and
overlap with pleasant effect. Quite dreamy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
GTMAP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is more of a demonstration of  a  routine rather than a screen in
its own right. Wiztom has  coded  a  very fast gouraud texture mapping
routine on the DSP, unfortunately its power is not really demonstrated
by this simple screen.

We get a triangle that  moves  about  the  screen,  there is no screen
clearing going on so it looks very messy. The triangle doesn't rotate,
its vertices are simply translated.

This technology could have been used  in  a very impressive screen, in
its current state you only get a glimpse of its power.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PALDSP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A rot zoomer with a twist -  the twist being a distortion sent through
the  zoomer  which  displaces  the  texture.   A  nice  twist  on  the
traditional rot zoomer (you've said this! - ED).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ROMEO
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Or "fractals  made  interesting".  Romeo  is  a  very  fast  julia set
calculator ( Romeo and Julia - geddit?  ), probably the best I've seen
on the Falcon. It also  features  some  nice palette changes which you
can imagine would have been synced to the music on the full demo.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ROTTA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember the Aggressive 2 party  invite?  Remember  the ace rot zoomer
with motion blur? Well  here  it  is  again.  And its still impressive
after all these years - no-one has  yet beaten it which is a testament
to Aggression's skills.

Ä----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUSIE
----------------------------------------------------------------------

'Susie' is Aggression's Wolf-3D  clone,  probably the best ray-casting
engine to hit the Falcon.  Owners  of  the  Aggression 128K intro will
have seen this before, and  unfortunately  it  has not been changed or
updated in any way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
TORUS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to the 3D-wasp, but not quite so exciting. A big dot 'a' spins
around, and with a tap on the  keys  transforms into a torus. More dot
based action courtesy of Mr DSP.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
WRITER
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's the text writer that graced the Aggression 128k intro. As well as
painting the Aggression  wasp  and  logo  it  draws  a  runner and the
legened 'Keep In  Motion'.  Elsewhere  a  terrible  aggression logo is
drawn.



It is difficult  to  review  stand-alone  demo  screens.  Their impact
usually comes from their context within a demo, the effects before and
after them and the music. There is some good stuff here, unfortunately
we have seen a lot of the best effects before.

Of the 'new' stuff, the dot-wasp is  superb with the other dot effects
being variations on this  routine.  The  Julia  is smart without being
revolutionary and the  rotating  bobs  fit  better  into  the world of
screen savers rather than high speed demos.

All in all,  Motion  is  something  of  a disappointment. Aggression's
superb effects on their  party  invite  and  128ktro promised much for
their full demo - little did we  know they had already unleashed their
best effects.

Whilst the effect  remain  technically  excellent,  the  fact they are
split up and unfinished  diminishes  their  effect.  Wiztom hopes that
someone will put them  together  into  a  demo,  but  this is unlikely
considering  some  effect  need  over   3.5mb   to  run  and  all  the
documentation is in Finnish. Something  could  still  be done with the
gouraud texture mapping though.

If most demo coders released the  'unfinished' directory of their hard
drive we would see a similar array of effects - some good, some not so
good and some obviously unfinished.  With  the  release of these files
Aggression have demystified the legend  of  'Motion'. No longer can is
it one of those sacred productions  that 'if finished would have ruled
Äthe falcon scene'. It  would  have  been  in  the  top 10 falcon demos
certainly, but it wouldn't  have  beaten  the  likes  of 'Sono', 'Eko-
System' or 'Lost Blubb'.


Aggression will be remembered for  their  incredible  ST demos such as
'Brain Damage', it's a shame  that  their  atari involvement has ended
with a whimper not a bang.
