128 byte intros. Hate them  or  despise  them,  you can't ignore them.
They are the programming  equivalent  of  a  guitar  solo  - a feat of
technical wizardry appreciated by other  practitioners  of the art but
loathed by the public at large.

Whilst with axe work the criteria for 'greatness' is length and skill,
128 byte intros are based on  shortness  and  skill. Just how much can
you squeeze into 128 bytes?  Had  DHS  and  our good selves pushed the
format to its limits? To judge by the latest releases, the answer is a
resounding no.

128 TRON II :: T.O.Y.S
----------------------------------------------------------------------

With 'Hong Tron Phooey' the Reservoir  Gods created both the first 128
byte game and the most  contrived  game  title. 'Hong Tron' placed the
player in a futuristic cityscape (a  blue square with some white dots)
with the task of flying  a  jet  powered  skybike  (a line) around the
skyscraper dots. Never before had  a  32-bit game been outperformed by
ZX81 releases. Some people even liked it.

But in the dark heart  of  sweden,  a  solitary  coder had his mind on
greater things. Peylow of TOYS (for it is he) decided he could squeeze
even more out of those 128 bytes.  He wanted multiplayer action and he
wanted in one eighth of a kilobyte.

Not being able to think of a name as terrible as 'Hong Tron Phooey' he
christened  his  game  '128  Tron  2'.  Gone  was  the  cityscape  and
skyscrapers and in its place was  a  fiendish human controlled line to
do battle with. You can  even  play  with  yourself (if you enjoy that
sort of thing).

After his work on ToyMan, Peylow  knows  all  about writing games in a
strictly limited space. 128 Tron 2  is  another triumph of man against
machine. Image the classic tron game in just 128 bytes with two player
on screen. Simultaneously. Keep imagining  and  it will save us having
to do a screenshot.

Unlike 'Hong Tron Phooey', 128 Tron 2 is  not much fun to play on your
own.  But  its  multiplayer  capabilities   open  up  new  avenues  of
entertainment. Who needs the  internet  and networked 'Half-Life' when
you can play 2 player tron on  your Falcon! The keys are also sensibly
layed out with cursors  for  one  player  and  numeric  keypad for the
other.
Ä
You can even redefine your  keys!  Well,  this  does involve typing in
scancodes into the supplied source,  but  should  you  be one of those
people who can only control Tron if their keys are Z,$,Right Shift and
Undo you can set this up with a bit of tinkering.

128 Tron 2 is class. Forget Marbles,  this is Peylow's best work since
'ToyMan'. 9/10

MANDEL :: NO CREW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

No Crew remain  an  enigma.  These  crazy  norwegians  knocked out the
flawed but  technically  excellent  'o-tentyk'  demo.  Their technical
skill is undoubted, their approach to design eccentric.

The 128 byte demos has inspired them  back  into life, and this is the
first fruit of their loins - a sort of 'second coming'.

As the title suggests, Fractals are on the menu and they are served up
in a strictly no frills manner.

Lets face it, fractals are dull at the best of times. Even coders have
to be pretend to be  interested  in  them. The Reservoir Gods 128-Byte
Mandlebrot 'Lettuce From Brechnev' was about  as popular as a UN peace
keeping team in Iraq. 'Mandel' offers a little more, but not enough to
get the paces pulsing.

'Just like the  first  Falcon  demos,  a  fractcal  zoom' promises the
readme file, forgetting that most  people  who were unfortunate enough
to witness the 'fractal zoom' sold their falcons soon afterwards.

One  of  the  many  great   things   about  fractals,  from  a  coders
perspective, is that they are  easy  to  zoom. And unlike bitmap zooms
they don't  loose  resolution  and  become  blocky  -  unless  you are
cheating or your floating point numbers underflow.

Like 'Lettuce', Mandel requires an FPU, but I wouldn't say that either
of these intros are worth buying an  FPU  for. Perhaps they are a good
reason to sell your FPU  and  force  fractal  coders to do things 'the
hard way'. That may just put a stop to it!

'Mandel' runs in a small corner of the screen (a 128x128 square if you
want to be anal about this). Its pretty hard to zoom a fractal in real
time using the brute force method,  especially  on the fpu, so this is
less of a zoomer more of  an  'updater displaying a smaller section of
mandlebrot set'. Doesn't quite trip off the tongue in the same way.

NoBrain has gone for the classic coders  trick of using shades of blue
to represent the iterations  of  the  mandlebrot.  Pretty this ain't -
lacking the crazy colours of 'Lettuce'.  It also doesn't do any screen
swapping so you can see the fractal being updated scanline by scanline
which sorts of ruins any illusion of zooming.

ÄAs Felice might say,  'Good,  if  you  like  that  sort  of thing'. It
improves  on  'Lettuce'  in  terms  of  features  but  falls  down  in
presentation. If Mandlebrots don't  tickle  your  fancy,  then you are
best off avoiding both of them. 6/10

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PLASMA :: NOCREW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the super  soaraway  success  of  'Mandel',  NoCrew  return with
'Plasma' - a super soaraway  plasma  effect!  Like their earlier demo,
'Plasma' requires an FPU. Also like  the earlier demo, 'Plasma' is not
really the 'Killer App'  that  will  persuade  millions  (?) of Falcon
users to invest in a floating point co-processor.

This plasma effect fills the screen  with  a  sea of curvy lines which
fluctuate  through  various  shades  of  green  and  blue.  There  are

obviously sinewaves at  work,  but  similar  effects  could  have been
created without the FPU.

Plasma is a pleasant enough  128  byter  and certainly gives DadPlaz a
run for its money. A quick smile rather than a toothy grin. 7/10


----------------------------------------------------------------------
SIERPINS :: NOCREW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Its a 'Power Morphing' sierpinski triangle.  We are not sure where the
'power' comes from (the  68030?  -Ed)  or  even  the morphing for that
matter. But it is a  sierpinski  combined  with another effect. That's
two whole effects in one 128 byter.

The sierpinski has already  reared  its  ugly  triangular  head in the
Reservoir Gods  'Renegade  Pasta'  intro.  It's  probably  the easiest
fractal to code - I even had to de-optimize some of the code to pad it
out to 128 bytes!

'PMST' starts slowly. In fact when I  first  ran it I wasn't sure that
it had started at all as no image  was obvious on my (very dark) atari
monitor. Then suddenly faint traces of blue began to appear which then
begin to seep across the screen  like  the cautious fingers of the sun
at daybreak. (What do you think this is? Reader's Digest? -ED)

So what you get is an averaging  effect,  similar to a fire effect but
far more subtle. If you leave the  screen running it builds up looking
more and more impressive. Its like  a  raytracer without all the balls
and checkered landscapes.  On  second  thoughts,  its  nothing  like a
raytracer at all.

If I was Jon Snow controlling  the  pendulum of 128 Byte Sierpinskis I
would point at that the factors  against  'PMST' are its slow pace and
initial darkness  (making  the  background  colour  black  would  have
helped) but  in  its  favour  are  its  added  depth  and  complexity.
Comparing this against 'Pasta' is  like  comparing instant coffee with
Äreal. If  you  like  your  effects  to  reach  a  climax  quickly  and
colourfully, go for pasta. If you prefer to take your time and reach a
more satisfying conclusion, go with the Power Morpher. 8/10

----------------------------------------------------------------------
PONG :: NOCREW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whilst once 'Hong Tron Phooey' resided  in  a motorcycle emptiness - a
lone 128 byte game in a metropolis  of 128 byte demos - reinforcements
are arriving in numbers.

Pong is NoCrew's contribution to the  128  byte games scene. And its a
bit of a corker.

There are two bats and a ball - well actually two lines and a pixel in
this implementation - what more do you need for a game?

Pong is totally mouse controlled  with horizontal movement controlling
one bat and vertical the other. This does prove a bit of a problem for
two player battles, but its great if  you want to play with yourself -
keep your eyes on the ball, grip it tightly and move it up and down.

Unfortunately the restrictions of 128 bytes  mean  there is no loss of
life, score or deviation of the ball from the most simple pattern. But
it does  remain  strangely  playable  and  is  infinitely  better than
holland games design's Ping 2000. 9/10


----------------------------------------------------------------------
STAAARS :: CHECKPOINT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'Grapes Of Hoth' was the first  128 byte starfield. It recquired a
Falcon and an FPU. Checkpoint's demo  runs  on a plain vanilla ST with
no additional floating point help required.

Starfields and demos are  synomous  so  it  is  only  a matter of time
before it became 'big' on the  128  byte scene. 'Staaars' is a classic
implementation of a classic effect. Reach for the staars! 8/10


----------------------------------------------------------------------
HUNT4FJI :: CHECKPOINT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The names get worse, the demos get better. RG (as ever) were the first
to attempt to make a  rot  zoomer  in  128  bytes. Their conversion of
Sanity's "Terminal Fuckup", the  cunningly  titled "Terminal Ketchup",
was a brave if flawed attempt, with rotating raster bars.

Whilst 'Ketchup' had the advantage  of  the  Falcon,  the FPU and true
colour mode (easy to plot pixels),  Checkpoint  had  an ST, no FPU and
bitplane mode. And they went and made  not  only the best 128 byte rot
zoomer but also the best 128 byte demo ever conceived.

ÄThe demo comes with an  installer  program  that searches through your
TOS ROM for the Fuji  bitmap.  Once  its  address has been located, it
wries a special version of the demo  which is set up for your machine.
There is not enough space to do this sort of search in a 128 byte demo
so this is a cool way to maintain compatibility.

Run the demo and be  amazed.  A  proper rot-zoomer featuring the atari
logo running at a  more  than  decent  speed  and featuring no obvious
corner cutting and glitches. This effect  is  good enough to have gone
in a full demo (in fact it  out  performs  a lot of rot zoomers I have
seen in full demos).

Truly stunning and a testimony  to  DefJam's skill. Well worth hunting
down. 10/10
