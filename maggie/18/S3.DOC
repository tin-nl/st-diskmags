If the recent explosion in the PC games scene can be traced to one piece
of hardware, it is the 3D  chipsets. Making processors faster and faster
is great for performing lots of  mathematical calculations, but there is
not necessarily an increase in the  amount  of data you can shift around
video RAM.

The Falcon suffers  from  the  similar  problem.  With  the  DSP you can
transform a large number of 3D  points,  but drawing the actual polygons
is slow. The reason for this  bottleneck  is manifold; the slow bus, the
slow memory and the fact you are tying up the CPU by just drawing polys.

3D cards give an elegant solution to  this problem. They work with their
own video memory in parallel with the  main  CPU. This video memory is a
lot faster than the memory you find  in  your Falcon. Just being able to
clear a high res true colour screen  in a frame would give a significant
advantage over our trusty bird.

Let's begin our study of the S3 Virge  with the range of 2D functions it
provides.

Åo BITBLITÄ

Ever since the STE, Atari  machines  have  been  equipped with a blitter
which allows the transfer  of  blocks  of  data  around  memory. The key
feature of the  Atari  blitter  was  its  ability  to  shift data across
bitplanes -  this  was  either  a  computationally  expensive  or memory
expensive operation in software.

The Blitter was not without  its  problems,  cheif amongst these was the
fact that it used the  same  bus  as  the  CPU  meaning that it couldn't
operate in parallel - an  advantage  that  the amiga's blitter enjoyed -
meaning thats it performance was  significantly impeded. Effectively you
could write software routines that outperfromed the blitter.

As the S3 Virge  operates  on  its  own  video  memory,  all its bitblit
operations (and all operations for that matter) can run in parallel with
the Phenix's CPU. This means that  the  Virge  can be shifting blocks of
data around video memory (for example drawing sprites or windows) whilst
the CPU is off doing other tasks.

Åo LINE DRAWÄ

Another problem with the  Atari  blitter  was  that  it only operated on
rectangles of data. You could draw squares, or masked sprites, but there
Äwas no ability to draw lines  (apart  from vertical and horizontal lines
which are just a subset of rectangles). The S3 Virge chip has the simple
but useful feature of being able to draw lines.

Åo POLYGON FILLÄ

Again, the Atari  blitter  could  only  do  polygon  fills  if they were
rectanglular. Theoretically you could  draw  a  polygon by recalculating
blitter offsets every scanline,  but  this  is  not a particularly speed
efficient way of drawing polygons. The S3  Virge has the ability to draw
filled polygons.


So just the 2D acceleration features  of  the  S3 Virge will give a huge
benefit over the current  line  of  Atari  machines. Whilst the assembly
language routines of NVDI and  MagiC  give impressive screen draw rates,
they will be as nothing compared to  the hardware acceleration of the S3
Virge. And its ability to throw chunks  of data around video memory will
be a real boon to 2D games programmers.


Now let's get onto the  real  meat  of  the  card  - the 3D acceleration
options.
For displaying polgyons, the Virge gives the following options:

Åo FLAT SHADINGÄ

Similar to the 2D filled  polygon  feature,  this  will display a single
colour polygon.

Åo GOURAUD SHADINGÄ

Here the colour of the  polygon  is  interpolated across its face giving
give more realistic and more aesthetically pleasing shading.

Åo TEXTURE MAPPINGÄ

A graphic image is mapped across the polygon face.

I'm sure you are all familiar  with  these  terms - they have become the
staple  of  atari  demos  for  the   last   five  years.  These  can  be
computationally expensive processes -  even  the  most optimised texture
mapping routines on the falcon  require  about  5 instructions per pixel
plus all the overhead of setting up the data. True gouraud shading isn't
really done in falcon demos - what  usually happens is an index value is
interpolated across the polygon face  and  this  is  used to reference a
palette table. The seperate RGB constituents of the colour are not split
up and interpolated - this is something that the S3 Virge can do, giving
much more impressive gouraud shading.

For an example of a true RGB  split shading, check out the 'Most Wanted'
demo by Scarface, then realise  how  much  detail  is lost in most other
gouraud routs!

Let's now look at some of the more advance 3D features:

Åo PERSPECTIVE CORRECTIONÄ

Because of the speed of the  falcon, perspective correct texture mapping
is rarely implemented.  The  way  texture  mapping  routines are usually
coded on the falcon is to use  'linear texture mapping'. This means that
the texel selected for each pixel of  the  polygon is just a function of
the the (x,y) position of that  pixel.  You  are just interpolating in x
and y and not taking into account the z position of each pixel.

With perspective  correct  teture  mapping,  the  texel  selected  is  a
function of the (x,y,z) position. This  gives a more accurated synthesis
of human vision. Whereas  in  'linear  mapping'  the texels selected are
evenly spaced out, the  space  between  texels selected for persepective
correct mapping varies with z.

An example: a large  texture  mapped  polygon  which  veers off into the
distance. At the positions on  the  polygon  where  it is closest to the
viewer there are only small  steps  between  the texels selected. As the
polygon moves into the distance  the  steps  between the pixels selected
increases.

Falcon programmers avoid perspective correction because of all the extra
calculations in involves for every single pixel drawn. With the S3 virge
this is no longer a problem!

Åo Z BUFFERINGÄ

Z-buffering is a method for  accurately  sorting 3D objects that handles
intersecting  and  overlapping  polygons.   Sorting   algorithms  are  a
problematic but often overlooked aspect  of  3D graphics. When rendering
your 3D objects you have to ensure they  are drawn in the right order so
that objects in the distance appear behind those in the foreground.

The most simple solution to  this  problem  is  the painters algorithm -
objects are just drawn in z order  -  draw the most distant object first
through to the closest objects last.  This  means distant object will be
drawn over with closer objects.

There are a number of problems with this approaches:

1. Unless an polygon is normal  to  the  z-plane, it can be difficult to
assign a single z value to it.  Usually  it  is given the average of all
its vertex z values, but this it  not a total solution. When sorting big
polygons against small polygons,  this  average  value can be misleading
and lead to sorting errors.

2. Intersecting polygons are not  handled.  One polygon will obscure the
other.

3. Overlapping polygons can be  problematic  and can flicker from behind
to in front of each other from one frame to the next.

A Z-buffer algorithm eliminates these problems. Instead of just sampling
one z value for each polygon, the z value is calculated at each pixel of
the polygon. It is then compared  against  the z value in our 'z-buffer'
(bascially an array that stores a z value for each pixel on the screen).
ÄIf the z value of our new  pixel  is more distant than the one currently
in the buffer the pixel is  discarded.  If  the  z value of our pixel is
near than the one in the buffer the  pixel  is drawn and the new z value
is stored in the buffer.

Z buffering has  been  implemented  on  a  number  of  falcon demos. The
classic EKO demos which boast of z  buffering are misleading - these are
using polygon intersection techniques.  This  involves considerably less
processing - just clipping  polygon  faces  against  other polygons, the
number of calculations is dependent on  the  number of poly faces rather
than the number of pixels.  Demos  which  use really z buffering include
the end part of built-in-obselence.  You  can  see that slight errors in
the accuracy of the z interpolation causing a zigzagging effect down the
intesected polygon edges - a sure sign  that proper z buffering is being
used. The S3 Virge shouldn't  suffer  from  such artefacts with its more
accurate z buffering.

If you want an example of a machine that doesn't use z-buffering look at
the Playstation and look at all  the horrendous sorting problems it has.
This won't be a problem for the S3 Virge!

Åo BI-LINEAR INTERPOLATIONÄ

Texture mapping can look very ugly,  especially when a small textured is
scaled up to a much large size.  Then  you can see each texel reprsented
by a large amount of pixels giving an unpleasing pixelation effect. Also
at lower detail when  the  polygon  is  a  lot  smaller than the orginal
texure map, the texel selected for each  pixel can vary a lot from frame
to frame causing a 'swimming' effect.

So in effect the two problems with have with texture mapping are:

1. Polgon Face larger than texture map  -> horrible chunky pixels as one
texel cover a multitude of pixles.
2. Texture map larger than polygon face -> loss of detail and 'swimming'
as a single texel is chosen to represent many.

Bi-Linear interpolation solves these problems.  Instead of just choosing
one texel for each pixel on  the  texture  map,  it finds all the texels
that contribute to that pixel (in  x  and y directions) and calculates a
weighted average of  those  pixel  values  before  drawing it. Bi-Linear
interpolation is  an  anti-aliasing  scheme  which  gives  much smoother
texture mapping.

Åo MIP MAPPINGÄ

Mip Mapping is a memory  hungry  technique that also eliminates aliasing
artefacts and gives a lot smoother  textures. It can also give increased
performance of the texture mapping.

MIP Mapping stored the texture map at a number of different resolutions.

At the top level there is the  original texture map. For each subsequent
level, the x and y dimensions are halved and a new texture map is stored
which now a quarter of the  size  of  the  one  in the level above. Each
texel in the new map is stored as an average of the four pixels from the
Ämap above so effectively anti-aliasing is precalculated.

When texture mapping the mip map which is closest in size to the polygon
is chosen and this is  used  for  the  texture  mapping. This means that
small textures can used the pre-anti-alised versions and as the movement
between texels in a texture is  smaller  cacheing is more effecient (the
smaller mip maps should fit totallly in a cache).


Åo TRI LINEAR FILTERINGÄ

This is a version of mip mapping  where seperate maps are stored for the
red, green and blue components of each texture. So instead of having one
texture map each level of the mip map, there are maps for red, green and
blue.

Like mip mapping, each level of  the  mip  map  stores a scaled down and
averaged version of the higher level.

When texturing, instead  of  just  choosing  the  mip  map  that closest
resembles the size of the poly, you choose the two maps that are nearest
to the polygon  size.  For  each  pixel  of  the  poly  you calculated a
weighted average from the texels in  the  two mip maps (combing the Red,
Green and Blue maps to create a pixel value).

Åo DEPTH CUEING & FOGGINGÄ

These are systems that base the instensity of a colour on the z distance
of that object  from  the  viewer.  They  give  a  lighting system where
objects are  smoothly  shaded  into  the  distance.  The  fogging  helps
disguise artefacts such as pop-up.


Åo ALPHA BLENDINGÄ


Alpha blending allows you to  overlay  polygons,  with  the top layer of
polygons acting as a filter for  lower  levels.  Anyone who has used the
'Add' or 'Sub' options in  GodPaint  will  be  familiar with some of the
effects you can use alpha blending for.

For example you can  overlay  a  poly  which  darkens everything under -
useful for displaying text on top.  Alpha  blending can be used for more
subtle effects such as a pane of glass in a 3D world or a smoke effect.


Åo MEMORY & COMPRESSIONÄ

The S3 Virge has on board 2  Megabytes  of  EDO-RAM. This has to be used
for the screen (or screens if double buffering), textures and a z-buffer
if needed.

Although this is a generous amount  compared  to the standard 4mb falcon
configuration, people are always  wanting  more  space  for textures. S3
have  a  very   cunning   compression   scheme   that  allows  real-time
decompression of textures!
Ä
Basically what this  means  is  that  you  can  store  a  load of packed
textures in video memory and when the  S3 displays the t-mapped polys it
realtime decompresses these to the display buffer.

The compression algorithm is lossy, but this shouldn't really be noticed
in high speed  3d  environments.  The  compression  ratio is impressive;
about 10:1 allowing you to squeeze a  large amount of textures in there.
Amazingly the performance hit  from  the  realtime decompression is very
small due to the virge's powerful decompression chips.


Åo SCREEN RESOLUTIONSÄ

The S3 Virge can display a lot of colours in high resolutions.
These are its standard resolutions:


   X      Y     Colours
+------+------+---------+
| 1280 | 1024 |   256   |
+------+------+---------+
| 1024 |  768 | 65536   |
+------+------+---------+
|  800 |  600 | 16.7m   |
+------+------+---------+
|  640 |  480 | 16.7m   |
+------+------+---------+

As you can see there is  support  for  the falcon's 16-bit "true colour"
resolution and also a glorious 16  million colour mode. Coders will also
appreciate the palettised byte per pixel  256 colour mode with which you
can do some funky effects without the headache of bitplanes!


Åo VIRGEÄ

Some people have already made some negative comments about the S3 Virge.
It is true that it is not as  powerful  than the latest 3D cards for the
PC.  But  that  is  missing  the   point  -  compared  to  the  graphics
capabilities of the Falcon it is  light  years ahead. It has very strong
2D acceleration which will allow to chuck  lots of big sprites about and
make 2D games better  than  anything  on  the  consoles  - something the
Falcon has not been very good at.

And we will be able to  throw  a  lot  of  polygons around and create 3D
environments that are both  detailed  and  fast!  Properly z-buffered 3D
worlds with texture mapping and gouraud  shading  will be possible - and
we can add perspective  correction  and  tri-linear  filtering should we
wish!

This is a 3D card that  outperforms  the playstation - a feat impossible
on the Falcon - and will look a lot nicer.

And we'll be able to get a good  deal  more perfomance out of it than PC
coders have been able to. On  the  PC  you  have to code very general 3D
Äroutines that will work on all the  card.  We can tailor our routines to
specifically get the maximum perfomance out of the Virge.

Also on the PC most programmers  use  Microsoft's Direct3D API for their
3D  engines.  As  you  would  expect   from  Microsoft  this  is  not  a
particularly  efficient  set  of   routines   and   adds  a  significant
performance hit to the 3D engine. We will be able to avoid this.

Even a very  simple  graphics  card  would  add  a  tremendous amount of
performance to the Falcon. On the Phenix  with its 060, DSP56301 and now
a decent 3D card which  can  run  in  parallel and knock out perspective
correct texture mapping with tri-linear filtering we are on the Virge of
greatness!
