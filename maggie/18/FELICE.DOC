This movie is the story of a young  girl who, being left behind by her
father  when  he  finds  a  job  (in  very  similar  circumstances  to
conditions here in the UK at the  moment) in another state of America,
decides that she will follow him.

A young Meredith Salenger (I  would  say  about  12-13 years old - but
attractive even at that age - and  that  is not meant to be a perverse
statement) stars in the title role.

After finding out that her father  has  dumped her, she goes in search
of him, riding trains, walking through  woods, learning to cook in the
open air, dodging rainstorms as they come on her long quest.
Ä
She meets some strange people on her journey who (I think) try to take
the mickey out of her - such as a  group of young kids who she  met in
the main street of a town she visited briefly.

On her first leg of her journey, she attended a 'fight' between a wolf
and a Rottweiler dog. The  wolf  killed  the Rottweiler no sweat, but,
after she had let him out of  the  hot  room where the fight was held,

came back to find her, first on  a  train, and then in the woods later
on during the film.

The film is, I feel, superb.  It  is  also recommended for stocking by
all video shops in  the  towns  and  cities  of  the  world [And other
worlds? -ED] - it is one film  that  does NOT contain scenes of sex or
violence - and yet is still an excellent movie.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Gaining employment automatically  causes  parents  to abandon their
children in the united kingdom.  Discuss  the cultural implications of
entering the workforce in this country compared to other nations, such
as Canada.

2. Finding 12 year girls sexually attractive; an inevitable symptom of
the modern media obsession with  sex  or  the  rantings of a  pervert?
Discuss with reference to Freudian  psychology and Gary Glitter's hard
drive.

3. "Learning to cook in  open  air".  With  reference to the Newtonian
model of physics, describe how you think food can prepared without any
utensils, containers or heating materials.

4. Define a 'strange person'.  How  would  you  take the mickey out of
them?

5. There are a wolf and a rottweiler dog in a hot room. They engage in
a fight to the death. How much  sweat would be secreted by the winning
animal?

6. Is it possible for a film to NOT contain scenes of sex and violence
and yet still be a great film?  Could  this film, or the author of the
article, benefit in any way from sex or violence?

ÄAmy (Meredith Salenger) is a young  teenage  girl who is still in high
school. She lives with her  father  Jack Halloran (Nicholas Kilbertus)
and her mother Hilary in a lovely house.

About 25 years before Amy was born,  her mother, Hilary, was in Africa
(the Belgian Congo) with her  sister  Felice.  While Hilary managed to
keep out of the black magic  that  was  going  on  there at the time -
Felice was trapped  in  the  middle  of  it  -  and something horrible
happened to Felice which  turned  her  into  a completely weird being.
[Sounds familiar! - ED]

Hilary left Africa for America  -  while  Felice travelled away on the
train to Europe - with  her  Aunt  -  who  -  after trying to strangle
Felice on the  train  journey  [We  Know  the  feeling! -ED], infected
Felice with a parasite, before dying.

So 25 years later Amy was at  her Christian conformation day, with her
parents, Jack and Hilary,  along  with  the next-door neighbour Brenda
watching the ceremony.


Hilary receives a disturbing phone call - from her sister Felice - who
she hadn't seen for more  than  25  years. Because Hilary thought that
Felice was threatening something over the  phone,  she went to a local
gunsmiths shop to buy a  small  gun.  While  she is there, an accident
occurs (a  van  smashes  straight  into  the  gunsmith's  shop)  badly
injuring Hilary in the process.  Hilary  died  later in hospital - and
the funeral as shown on the film  is  very sad. [Fits in well with the
film's audience then. -ED]

During her mother's funeral, Amy sees a strange figure among the trees
who  walks  away  into  the  wilderness  at  the  other  side  of  the
churchyard.

However, Amy has a nagging doubt in  her  mind about Felice - and this
is realised even  further  when  her  friend  Heather  has an accident
involving an escalator in the shopping mall. [Sounds nasty! -ED]

More of these 'accidents'  also  happen  to  other  people such as the
local Reverend, Father Joe, and even to Amy herself, with an excellent
sequence involving a model of a heart  and lungs system (you will have
seen these in biology at school) but  where the heart starts beating -
a truly excellent piece of film. [Sounds great! -ED]

Amy's boyfriend Terry - who worked  in  the  cake shop in the shopping
mall - [Oh, that Terry! -ED] was  worried about Amy, after the meeting
they had where Amy told all her  fears to him i.e, about Felice, about
the strange things that had happened since she had arrived, etc. Terry
promptly went to the hotel where Felice was staying - and, as a result
of her extraordinary powers - was killed. [Obviously. -ED]

All this boils to a  head  when  Brenda  takes  a  jumper to the local
hospital [Good Plan! -ED] (the 'vampire's lair' blood-testing section)
and learns the truth  about  Felice  -  ending  up  with Jack, Amy and
Brenda at home,  with  the  result  that  -  again  during a fantastic
sequence - Felice died in  the  swimming  pool, after being stabbed by
ÄAmy with an electric saw.

So,  there,  the  film  ends.  A  fantastic  performance  by  Meredith
Salenger, Joanna Pacula, Nicholas Kilbertus  and  the rest of the cast
and crew - all who, incidentally, are best of friends in real life.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Films and reality. How likely is  that a teenage girl would also be
young, live with her mother and father and attend school?

2. Architecture - "the lovely house". Design a "lovely house".

3. Geography  - you are travelling in  a train across Europe. In which
country would it be best to  attempt  to strangle your sister and then
infect her with  a  deadly  parasite?  Answer  with  reference  to the
country's judiciary system and hygiene record.

2. Uncivilised nations and the  dark  arts.  Discuss the prevalence of
magic in Africa, about 25 years ago.

3. Felice is "trapped in the middle" of the black magic and has turned
into a  "completely  weird  being".  Describe  the  key  psychological
differences between Felice and normal human beings.

4. Telephone Psychology - "The  Disturbing Phonecall". Imagine you are
Felice and making a disturbing phone call to, for example,  a 12 or 13

year old girl who, for example,  you find attractive. With what words,
or noise, would you initiate the conversation?

4. Funerals and sadness.  Describe  how  you  think  the event and the
emotion may be linked.

5. You find someone suspicious  and  untrustworthy.  A friend of yours
has an accident on an elevator  in  a  shopping  mall. How are the two
events linked?

6. ( For biology students  only  )  What  do  the heart and lungs look
like?

7. Bakers and black magic. How  would  the cake shop assistant, Terry,
be best advised to tackle Felice's extraordinary magical powers?

8. Fantastic  sequences  in  cinema.  Compare  and  contrast  the best
sequences from the films   "2001:  A  Space Odyssey", "Apocalypse Now"
and "Citizen Kane" with "amy stabbing Felice with an electric saw in a
swimming pool".

9. Is a film improved or impaired  by  the fact that the cast and crew
are best friends in  real  life?  Would  the  author  of this piece be
improved or impaired by having friends in real life?


Ä======================================================================

ÑDr Berkmann would like to remind  students that their are still places
left on his "Felice Studies" master  degrees. He recommends the course
to psychologists, biologists, theologians and zoologists.

Semester One includes "Traffic Calming  Schemes  in The Cambridge Area
versus The Human Psyche", "Car  Parking  In Tescos, Myth or Anti-Myth"
and "Hollywood  Celebrities  and  Their  STs".  Book  early  to ensure
disappointment.Ä
