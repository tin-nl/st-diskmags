   Welcome Atari lovers ! Here is EdO / Sector One on the grey keyboard
and for my fist article for the disk magazine Maggie, I will report the
last coding party held in Cournon d'Auvergne in the center of France.

   This party was organized by Mentasm,a french PC crew and tooks place
from the 19th to the 21 february.

   I really enjoyed the last Volcanic Party in 1998 so I sent the reply
form (the price was 90 francs). Although this party is without interest
for Atari people,I really think it is normal that the readers of Maggie
know how are all last productions on  others  machines : all Atari fans  
shouldn't be sectarian (I believe it ! ;-). 

   I left Maisons Alfort (my city near Paris)  friday  in  the  morning 
around 8.00 am. After I took the musician of Sector One, the best musi-
-cian in the world Dma Sc (private joke : hey Dma,I said it ! :-) in le
Mee sur Seine, an unknown city around Paris hehehe ! 

   After some adventures in the middle of forests and on roads , we are 
arrived ! But real problems begun: last year,we waited around 5 minutes 
but because of a lack of organization,there was too many people !Argh !
 
   It's an understatement to say Mentasm did a bad work :-(    

   At least 60 guys were in front of us ! And I spoke with  a  man  who
waited more than 3 hours ! Us,with a little lie and thanks to Exyl from
Sector One and Razaac from Supremacy,we succeeded in convincing organi-
-zers we haven't got computers. In fact , our accomplices installed our
machines while we waited :-).

   Well, the fist time I entered in the big room, I though:"what a lot
of people !". I heard there was about 850 people.

   We could meet on the spot :

- all my accomplices of Sector One (St Ghost,Hello,Exyl,Dma Sc)
- St Survivor/Loud! (great Toxic Mag !)
- CyberFranck/Dizzidence (who is working on a remake of Fruity Franck, 
an old game on Amstrad CPC)
- Razaac/Supremacy
- First/Typhoon (he's got a Hades 040)
- Fabounio (a musician on Falcon)
- Ptif and Telsud/Typhoon (the most french promising coders)
- The Beast/Typhoon (keep up the good work on the Toxic mag too !).
- some alone Atari users as Fanfan (#Atarifr rulez :-).

Ä   Unfortunatly,I'm very sad to say that there was any Atari production
presented at this party . The main reason is the lack of people who are
motivated :-(. When I said nothing , I really said NOTHING. Yes english
friends , you must know french scene is dying. Of course , we try to be
active but because of the lack of programmers, a lot of projects  won't
never see the light of the day :-(.   

   I hope the next Atari party called 'Error in Line' in  Germany  will
give me another impression . Contrary to the Atari scene , the Amiga or
PC scene is very active : PC demos was so beautiful: 3D, bitmap effects
and a very good design ! Yes, even I really enjoy my poor STE , I don't
hesitate to say that demos on PC are best productions I have ever seen! 
   If it continue, we'll have to migrate to the PC scene...
   Herm no, it is a joke :-p. Hehehe ! I bought a  PC  too  but  it  is 
easier to work on our old but good Atari machines.

   Ah ! I forgot an important thing : I'm not very  proud : I'm a lier.
   In fact,it seems that Ptif and Telsud have done a little dentro not
really technical but funny (the duck was great :-).

   We awaited all impatiently the official output of our next game  Pie
Bill Gates. Yes,we know we are late but it is not our fault! Because of
some exams and some problems with the falcon of Exyl/Sector One (thanks
the Centurbo 2) , the game is not finished : only highscores to add ! I
must admit I spent all my time in front of my PC : games, MP3, PC demos
circulated a lot :-). The only funny thing was on Saturday in the  eve-
-ning : a film X was displayed. And in the original format please : you
could hear : 'Ohhhhh ! My god ! Yesssssss......'.  Very cool except for 
the rare girls at the party ;-).

   In general,all productions on other machines was so great:good demos
on PC (I was disappointed about Amiga productions), great music compe -
-tition and last but not least great graphics (particularly from a  guy
called ZAAC on Amiga : good work guy ! Made in 3 days , his graphic was
amazing, this boy almost slept on his machine). But I repeat :  only PC
and Amiga fans was active !

   To conclude, this coding party was without interest  for  the  Atari
machines.If you had a PC (it's my case, sorry) your presence was justi-
-fied for hot stuffs you could take (it was a copy party for me).

   I wonder how the guy exclusively on Atari could  be  busy  with  his 
machine. Lost time I think ... So , I  won't go to the Volcanic Party 6
next year. I prefer Atari parties.

   Bye and have fun : stay ACTIVE !
