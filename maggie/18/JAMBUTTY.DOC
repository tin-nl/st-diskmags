The  world  of  atari  has   been   rife  with  rumours,  accusations,
speculation and all-over body massages  following  the appearance of a
shadowy, mysterious figure on  the  Dead  Hackers  bulletin board. The
shadowy and mysterious (you've done this  bit -ed) character was known
only by the handle 'jam butty'. His ranting annoyed and entertained in
unequal measure.

The man like 'butty' has had  the  audacity to launch stinging attacks
on such scene luminaries  as  Carbon  of  (ex)-Reject. He also savaged
criticised this humble magazine for its punchant for puns.

But who  is  the  man  behind  the  sandwich-laced-with-fruit-conserve
monicker?  The  accusations  have   been   flying   like  some  sordid
reconstruction of the  Lewinsky.  The  atari  scene's  biggest private
Dick, Evil, has been first on the case.

The swede's thorough investigations revealed that the butty-killer was
operating from a 'freeserve' account,  which  quickly narrowed it down
to about 90%  of  the  online  UK  community.  And  others abroad with
internet access.

The maggie team has started its own Kenneth Star like investigation to
track down "That Jam".  With  a  multi-million  dollar budget from our
loyal readers and remit to 'leave no stone unturned'.

Our intrepid investigators have completed a  list of suspects during a
harrowing session at the local supermarket.  But  who has jam on their
fingers?


Bob Charlotte - Nintendo of America inc.
----------------------------------------

Nintendo spokesman who got heavily  embroiled  in the legendary GodBoy
scandal which had  wide  ranging  repercussions.  "Nintendo have never
recovered"  commented  one   industry   insider   (Alan  Hamblin  from
Blockbuster Video, Banbury)

The theory is that Bob is trying to resurrect Nintendo's fortunes with
a new promotional campaign  of  fake  postings  to demo scene bulletin
boards. This theory has not yet been subjected to any testing.


msg / reservoir gods
--------------------

ÄThe man behind the big jeans who sports the largest American accent in
Harrogate. Is known  to  have  close  links  with  Bob  Charlotte (see
above). His brash personality may be a cover for dark secrets. The MI5
dossier on him is the size  of  a  (very small) telephone directory. A
spokeswoman for the British  secret  service  revealed "although he is
from Scotland he speaks with a highly pronounced American accent. We
suspect that he is either a  CIA  operative or an undercover Christian
evangelist".

The theory is that a crazed  msg,  high on illegal drugs (cider), made
several nonsensical writings about disk  magazines  that he has little
interest in. Noodles may have been involved.


carbon / ex-suspect
-------------------

Carbon left the atari scene under a cloud (it is always raining in the
UK) to spearhead the emerging scene on a promising new computer called
the IBM PC. But in Judas-like  display  of triple crossing he betrayed
his loyal fans on the PC who  were  left to flounder, bereft of future
reject PC productions. The PC is yet to recover from this loss.

Carbon already has  a  comprehensive  fake  CV  with  fake demos, fake
credit cards, fake questions for  Ian  Bell  and  also a fake email to
replacement keyboard lover, Dave Hollis.

The theory: Carbon tried to raise his profile by initiating an furious
argument with himself on the  bulletin  board.  It is already rumoured
that carbon enjoys beating himself.


s0mebody
--------

Known and feared as the bot that  regulates the atari channels of IRC,
he is a creature who knows everyone's  name and when they last visited
the specified channel. He is the all seeing-eye of the atari scene. No
matter what dead time of the night  you visit IRC, there he is waiting
and watching.

The theory: Frustrated with his  lack  of  recognition s0mebody made a
bid for fame and glory  with  a  concerted  attack  on all and sundry.
After years of docile service he finally snapped.


Norman Cook
-----------

The former housemartin has  hit  the  charts  again  recently with his
'Fatboy Slim' handle. He  holds  the  record  for  entering the charts
under the  greatest  number  of  different  names.  One  of  these  is
Pizzaman, a food  based  handle  with  a  chilling  similarity to 'Jam
Butty'. Is known to own an ST.

The theory: Bored  with  multi-million  dollar  pop  super stardom and
Äshagging Zoe Ball, Norman infiltrated the DHS lair and posted a series
of 'whacky' messages in the hope  they would provide some new material
for his girlfriend's breakfast show.


Evil / DHS
----------

Is known to look  somewhat  similar  to  Al  Bundy  from 'Married With
Children'. Spends long hours in a 'bunker' with numerous other swedes.
Was one of the sinister masterminds  behind  the evil 'DHS Porno' demo
that corrupted the youth of our nation ( (c) Daily Mail ). Is known to
visit the DHS pages on regular  occasions.  Has written many things on
the 'scene news' pages. Has  means  and  opportunity. Has fondness for
both jam and butties (allegedly).

The theory: tried to liven up the sagging debate on his bulletin board
by starting a 'phony war' (he used his modem).


carbon2 / reject
----------------

When carbon  quit  the  pc  scene  to  rejoin  the  atari  scene,  his
personality was split in  two  and  a  new  entity, "evil carbon", was
created. This new Carbon was the antithesis of the original carbon, he
was slim, witty and could even program.

The theory: sickened by the  adulation  carbon  was receiving from the
atari scene, evil carbon struck  back  at  his  former self. For it is
written that "No one  hates  thee  like  theeself", Book of Morrissey;
Chap 14; verse 4.


felice / maggie team
--------------------

Has been known to post  long  and  rather strange messages to bulletin
boards. Is afraid of carbon based life forms. Dislikes traffic calming
schemes, especially in the camridgeshire area. Had his chips stolen at
a party once. Was bullied by  a  gym  teacher. Has been known to video
module competitions.  Has  had  brushes  with  the  law.  It  has been
discovered that "Felice" is not his real  name, this is just a nom-de-
plume for one Richard Spowartt.

The theory: Felice, high on crack and toting a machine gun, decided to
law down the law using the power of ascii. He bears the scars.


jam packer coder
----------------

Long forgotten coder of long forgotten packer. Both have used the word
'jam'. Has possibly  eaten  butties.  Probably  had  an  argument with
someone once. Will this do? (you're sacked - ED)

ÄThe theory: Angry at  being  forgotten  by  the  scene, the Jam Packer
coder attempted to raise his profile  with  a series of postings. Will
this do? (you're still sacked - ED)

Dave Hollis
-----------

Former ST+ editor and atari  enthusiast  now  turned to the dark side.
Thinks windows is a 'very stable operating system'. Has been victim of
fake mails  and  may  want  revenged.  Has  fondness  for  replacement
keyboards (at 35 UK pounds).  Has  fondness for typing. Lacks fondness
for Carbon.

The theory: forced to prove  himself  in  a horrific PC initialisation
ceremony by denouncing  his  former  atari  disciples.  May have typed
messages with a replacement keyboard.


Tony Greenwood
--------------

Original 'angry old man' of atari  scene. Has launched many criticisms
against other ataris. Is a member  of the subversive 'Preston Noth End
Supporters Club'.  Has  come  into  contact  with  STOS  basic  for  a
prolonged period. Dislikes 'jokes' in magazines.

The theory: he was just being himself.


Geoff Brown
-----------

Shadowy and mysterious overlord of GBH  and former emperor of US Gold.
Has curly hair. Owns  many  companies,  each  with different names. Is
looking into 'the internet'. Has a finger in many pies.

The theory: Attempted buyout  of  'Reject  Developments' went sour and
things turned nasty.


Grey / Mystic Bytes
-------------------

Official spokesperson  for  the  Polish  scene.  Once  declared  'I am
ribbit'. Angered by Christmas jokes. Was  once a member of shadowy and
mysterious polish group, the shadows.  Has mentioned 'Monica Lewinsky'
on a number of occasions.

The theory: it was a long night  and  there  was a lot of vodka within
easy reach.


MrPink / RG
-----------

Diskmag writer and games creator  now  turned  PSX coder. Changes hair
Ästyle on a regular  basis.  All  are  terrible.  Was  once declared as
'shadowy and  anonymous'  by  Computer  Shopper  magazine.  Lives near
Banbury. Once tried to  smoke  washing  powder.  Has been arrested for
pretending to be french.

The theory: had nothing much  to  write  about  for maggie so invented
everything 'just to get copy'.

Do you know who Jam Butty is? Perhaps he is someone you know but don't
realise it -  a family  member,  friend,  pet, postman, grocer or even
your local dealer.

Do you know  someone  who  acts  suspiciously  when  on  the internet?
Perhaps they lock themselves in  their  room  for long periods of time
when on the internet? They don't  let  you  see what is on the screen?
Maybe they turn it off or quickly  shut  down the window when you come
into the room? Do they like  jam?  After  a long internet session, are
their fingers sticky?

If this answer to any  of  these  questions  is 'yes', 'maybe' or even
'no' then we may have found our man!  Don't try and tackle him alone -
contact your local AtariPolice and let them deal with the situation.

Don't have nightmares!
