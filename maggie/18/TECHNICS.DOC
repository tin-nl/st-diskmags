There are two  different  approaches  to  buying  a  hi-fi system. The
first, and simplest, is to be an all-in-one unit which contains the cd
player, amp, tape decks and  comes  with  speakers.  The second is the
pick 'n' mix approach  of  separate  systems  where  you purchase each
component separately.

Whilst mini-systems offer a quick  solution,  the sound quality cannot
match that of separates. The  argument  against separates is that they
are expensive and  cumbersome.  The  is  a  reason  behind their size,
spacing out the internal components gives a cleaner sound as parts are
further away from each other they don't pick up so much interference.

You have been able to pick up  decent speakers and amps for around 100
UK pounds,  but  the  budget  CD  players  have  had  build  and sound
qualities that match their price tag.

The  selection  of  budget  CD  players  hasn't  been  too  promising.
Companies like Matsui  and  Goodmans  knocked  out  cheap players with
cheap looks and cheap sounds.  The  only  real  option was the Chinese
made Eclipse player marketed by richer sounds. But now some of the big
audio players have stepped into the market with some rather impressive
systems that find favour with both the ears and the wallet.

The panasonic PD-107 is  a  nice  machine,  good  looking with capable
sound qualities. At 100  notes  it  is  certainly  good value. But now
technics have entered the  market  place  with  a  player that appears
equally as good and is 10 pounds cheaper.

My Sherwood CD-320R has been dying  a  slow and ugly death. It started
with a minor clicking noise heard during the early tracks of CDs. This
soon evolved into a bone shaking  rattle. This was annoying, but could
be compensated by pumping up the volume.  But then CDs started to jump
on the first few tracks. I managed to counteract this by placing 2 CDs
in the player at a  time  which  stopped  the jumping. But things were
still deteriorating. By last month it  had  got  to the state where it
was virtually impossible to play the first 3 tracks on any of my CDs.
I had been reduced to listening to CDs  on my saturn through a tv, and
this really can't handle any sort of bass.

My life would be empty  without  a  constant  supply  of music, and my
€tickets for Error In Line  had  stripped  my  bank account. I needed a
cheap but decent player. Second hand  was  an option but I didn't want
another  machine  that  was  falling   apart.  I  visited   'Buzzards'
(Banbury's no 1 hi-fi store according to  the ads) and 5 minutes later
walked away with the new Technics  SL-PG390, leaving them 90 pounds in
return.

The technics is well featured for  the  price.  I do found most extras
superfluous though - who can be bothered to program the track order? I
also find the random feature pretty  useless, especially with mix cds.
The repeat function will get used occasionally though. The choice of 4
time modes is nice, one extra than most players.

This is a player designed for recording from. There is an auto-cue and
a peak search. As well as the  phono outputs there is a digital output
so you can record stuff onto mini disk.

First impressions are good - it  looks  smart and, as you would expect
from technics,  the  build  quality  is  excellent.  The  drawer opens
smoothly, unlike the 'popping up toast' effect of some players.

The slightest jitter would send my  old  player into a frenzy. Placing
any object on top of it or tapping the surface it was resting on would
cause it to jump. The technics is built of far sterner stuff - you can
drop books on it and it won't  skip  a beat. Try banging it or tilting
it or shaking the table it's on  and  player doesn't even break into a
sweat, the music continues smoothly. Top marks.

It copes well with scratched CDs -  throwing my battered copy of DIY's
deep house compilation  "strictly  4  groovers"  gave  it no problems,
whilst my old player would fall over in a choking fit.

The sound quality is  excellent.  Basslines  are  powerful, it doesn't
lose detail in the mid-range and its still smooth at high frequencies.
It easily matches machines in the next class up.

I have only two criticisms against  the  technics player. The first is
the lack of  a  headphone  port,  needed  if  your  neighbours are not
partial to you rinsing out the  airwaves with your jump-up drum'n'bass
tunes at 4 o'clock in the morning.

The other annoyance is the power light -  it comes on when you turn it
off! It is actually a standby light,  which is off when the machine is
on and vice versa. To actually get  it  to turn off you have to unplug
the machine.

But these are minor grips, and  the Technics capabilities far outweigh
them. It's superbly built,  rides  smoothly  over bumps, has fantastic
sound and is ridiculously cheap. Highly recommended.
