          The Gus Spank  M o r n i n g   E d i t i o  n
                         S e s s i o n...


(The story so far... Having managed to convince some rather blind, 
deaf and paraplegic people the he is a good thing generally, Danny 
Baker,  sorry  Gus  Spank now has his own radio show...  This is a 
sample of the first day and is based on an actual recording of the 
show..)

(Or, people who can't answer back made fun of very cheaply..)

                T h e   E x p l a n a t i o n....
In  trying to be more like Danny Baker I've tried several  things, 
eating  Mars  Bars,  getting fat,  eating some washing powder,  but 
nothing  can beat the endless stream of drug-induced(*) trivia  we 
get  on  Radio 5 first thing in the morning (Massacre  of  English 
cricket team excluded.)

(*) My explanation for it all, can anybody else do better??

So what better way to kick-off than this..

(Danny..)  "Pissing hell,  do you mean I have to get up at 5.30 in 
the  morning EVERY F*cking day to do this show,  I think this is a 
wind-up...  Oi  Jeremy  Bloody  Beadle,  where the F*ck are  you!! 
Kerrist, I need a drink NOW!!"

(Producer..)  "Shut  up!  Shut up you stupid fat cockney  bastard, 
I'll  see  you'll  never  work on radio  again  if  your  attitude 
doesn't... Oh Shit!! We're on air!!! Quick do something, get  that 
Gus Corporal Punishment bloke on or something!!!"


                         ----On air----

Radio Five jingle plays..

(Gus..) "Good morning, I'm Danny Ba... er Gus Spank on the morning 
show today, I see we have a caller waiting for us on the line.."

(1st  Caller..)  "Hello,  I think it's really great the  way  that 
choice  has been limited in the kind of computer you can buy,  now 
my question is, what kind of PC's are there.."

(Gus..)  "Well  there are two basic kinds of PC,  just forget  the 
hundreds of different names for one minute..  First of all,  there 
is  the  CHEAP  PC,  which is made out of the  scummiest  cheapest 
components  that small amounts of money will buy..  These have the 
drawback  of tending to burst into flames at completely the  wrong 
time,  amongst other things..  Watch out for PC's built especially 
to  give an impressive Norton rating but are a bit naff for  real-
world  applications..  Alternatively  you  could  go  for  a  MORE 
EXPENSIVE PC which may have an identical on-paper performance spec 
to  the  CHEAP  PC,  but will actually work in a  meaningful  way. 
However  you  are still left with the empty bitter taste  in  your 
mouth of being ripped-off for too much money.."

(Gus..) "Oh, and I am forgetting the VERY CHEAP PC as built by 
Dave  'Pixie' Hodges from bits found on the rubbish dump or  under 
the pile of junk that is his bed.."

(Caller..) "Erm,  thanks.."

(2nd   Caller..)  "Are  the  people  in  charge  of  present   day 
entertainment software actually descended from those people in the 
19th Century who predicted that railways would not catch on???"

(Gus..)  "That  is not quite right,  I think the early critics  of 
rail travel all suffocated in a train which went a tad over  30mph 
back in about 1850.  We can only guess where the softco chiefs get 
their narrow views on computer hardware from.."

(3rd  Caller..) "I think I have got the answer for the Last  Words 
of  President  Kennedy competition,  they  were  "Fllmmmpphhggg!!! 
Mmnnnbbbhh!""

(Gus..) "Nope, not even close..."

(4th  Caller..) "I've got a friend who owns an Amiga,  and he says 
that  four channel 8-bit sound is good enough for home  use,  what 
are your views Danny, er Gus.."

(Gus..)  "I  would strongly suggest you stop hanging  around  with 
such sad people and try to get some real friends instead.. I think 
you   ought  to  gently  tell  your  friend  that  Atari   whupped 
Commodore's ass on this one.."

(5th  Caller..) "I hear that MUG UK has a policy  of  confiscating 
disks containing pirate software that foolish and misguided people 
send to him,  he apparently has over 2000 of these now but has not 
yet got around to erasing these yet..."

(Gus..)  "I think that he must have a terrible memory  because  he 
just forgets where something is as soon as he puts it down!!"

(Musical break:-Something by the Clash, an old '70s band disrupted
at odd intervals by a frog noise generated at the random  pleasure 
of Danny, er Gus..)

End of musical interlude..

(Gus..)  "Another question,  how many software executives would it 
take to change a lightbulb.."

(6th  Caller..) "I own an Amiga and would like to know  where  you 
can  get  very cheap disks that only work two out of  every  three 
times like all the other Amiga owners have..  I hear that ex-cover 
disks that have been re-used twenty times are just ideal.."

(Gus..)  "Sorry,  those  weren't  President Kennedy's  last  words 
either.."

(7th  Caller..)  "You said yesterday that the average  human  head 
takes three minutes to microwave. This is not true, as I tried it, 
and it took me nearly ten minutes to finish the job.. Why??"

(Gus..) "Next time,  try to remove the aluminium nose-plugs before 
you put your head in the oven, and lose those tinfoil ear-muffs
whilst you are about it as well.."

(7th  Caller..)  "I  think I have the  answer  to  the  light-bulb 
question  as well...  No software executives change the lightbulb, 
as they are too busy hyping up the new bulb to release it.."

(Gus..) "Bloody right!!  try your head in the microwave for twenty 
minutes and come back tomorrow.."

(Gus..) "Any Console owners out there can win a special prize just 
by phoning in, a free shallow grave in the countryside beauty spot 
of their choice!!"

(Another musical interlude:- A good song cruelly cut short when it 
is getting to the good bit by some more D.J verbiage..)

(News:- Depressing... Sports:- Also depressing...)

(Gus..)  "This weeks BIG competition,  for Dept of Social Security 
bosses   only,   now  would  you  lend  œ100  for  a   second-hand 
refridgerator  out of the Social Fund,  or would you NOT lend œ100 
for a second-hand fridge, spend œ7500 in legal fees defending that 
decision  in  Court,  and  still lose??  THAT's RIGHT,  keep those 
lawyers  happy  at  least,  it's only the taxpayer's  money  after 
all!!"
*This is a TRUE STORY by the way!*

(Gus..)  "I  now have Ocean software supremo Gary  Bracey  on  the 
line, hello Garry."

(G.B..)  "Hello Gus,  I'm here to answer a few questions about the 
role of software companies, and of course, Ocean in particular.."

(Gus..) "Right, first off, do you think the software companies are 
subtly  suggesting that people move away from the ST,  even though 
it's  user-base still numbers several hundred thousand people,  by 
the steep reduction in software releases.."

(Gazz..) "Subtle?  Ha ha ha! Software companies are as subtle as a 
nightclub  bouncer holding an outstretched Walther  PPK  screaming 
"Buy a Console or the puppy dies!""

(Guzz..) "But aren't Ocean contributing to the process themselves, 
take  'Sleepwalker' for example,  'Comic Relief' has now been  and 
gone,  and no sign of the ST version of this game,  do you want to 
sell in any meaningful fashion on the ST??!"

(Gass..) (Mumble) .. "Something to do with production problems.."

(Guss..) "You mean difficulties with the special triangular-shaped 
disks the ST uses???"

(Gab..)  "Cheeky bastard!  I mean the production priorities  which 
means  that the Amiga always has first pick,  with the PC not  far 
behind, no room for the ST until much later.."

(Gub..) "Well why not cut down the pre-release hype, if there's no 
chance  of release for a specific date,  you see this with all the 
Xmas releases as well.."

(G.Bracey..) "Look son, our advertising department has a budget to 
spend,  and  they  are  UNDER PAIN OF DEATH to fill all  the  main 
monthly  magazines  with  full-page ads  for  semi  or  completely 
comatose  Ocean products..  God knows,  they try to get rid of the 
money  in other ways,  stuffing thousands on pounds down the waste 
disposal  until the sewer outfall just jammed solid,  the  plumber 
said  it  was  like Dennis Nilsen's house  all  over  again..  You 
youngsters just don't know how tough it really is!!"

(G.Spank..)   "That  seems  to  confirm  something   I've   always 
suspected..  Now  what exciting new software is coming to the  new 
Atari Falcon from Ocean??"

(Brace..) "Errrrm,  what's a FALCON??  But seriously folks,  it'll 
get  the same level of support,  love and devotion as  Commodore's 
new machine,  the A1200,  that is a big 'A1200 Compatible' sticker 
on  the  box,  and  a couple of extra scrolly parallax  layers  if 
you're lucky.."

(Spanky..) "Well thank you for your time Gary, see you around!"

(Gary..) "Bye Gus.."

(Gus..)  "Now it's fast coming up to nine o'clock,  time for me to 
go  off and do some fat cocksure cockney kid voice-overs for  Mars 
Bars and washing powder, there go the pips,,,, Byeeee!!"

                           ----Off Air----

(Gus..) "Well that's me finished, I'm off.."

(Producer..) (Sotto voco) "Yes, you're finished all right!"
