This is a very special issue of Atari Explorer Online. Earlier this
week, Atari Corp. hosted a press conference to show off the new Atari
Jaguar videogame/multimedia system. Many mainstream press people
attended, and nearly all were awed at what Atari had to show them.

Late last night (Friday) on an AEO conference call, the editorial
staff decided that the information released was of such interest to
the Atari faithful, AEO should focus this week on the Atari Jaguar.

Atari is planning a 4th Quarter 1993 launch in the New York and
San Francisco markets using spot TV, local cable, gaming
publications and a local PR effort (all backed by a $3,000,000
budget) to push the machine. $45,000,000 is earmarked for the
national campaign which should start in January 1994. The Jaguar
itself will debut at the $200 price point, with software priced
between $50 and $80. Atari wants to establish the Jaguar as an
industry standard. Phrases like "Cable TV network connectivity,"
"full motion video," "full length motion pictures on CD," and this
summer's hottest buzz term, "virtual reality" are being spoken of at
Atari.

For the latest news from Atari (that is, until the next AEO), tune
into the World of Games RTC with Bob Brodie and Atari President Sam
Tramiel this Wednesday on Delphi. Bob will also be the Guest of Honor
at a upcoming GEnie BBS RT RTC, and at the First Anniversary Dateline:
Atari RTC on Friday, September 3rd at 10 p.m. EDT, at the GEnie ST
RoundTable. (With Atari Works, MultiTOS and SpeedoGDOS as prizes!)

Yet _another_ RTC with both Bob and Sam Tramiel is planned for GEnie
to specifically discuss the Jaguar. No date has yet been set - watch
AEO for future details.

//// Return of the "Snapshot Special"
 
Back when AEO was Atari's Official Online Magazine, it was brought up
with Bob Brodie that Targa files of some Jaguar game screens would
make interesting viewing, "when the time is right." Well, that time
is now. True to his word, Bob had about twenty screen shots made, and
has released them to the media.

We have included what we feel is the best of the crop with this
issue. Rather than making this download run, oh, well over 500K, our
files have been converted into the smaller, and more widely used GIF
format. (Conversion to 320x256 256-color GIF files done expertly by
N&F Editor Ron Kovacs.) For those who want the True Color Targa
files, we will be uploading the Atari files to the GEnie ST RoundTable
over the weekend.

These files are: SNAP1.GIF  from Raiden
                 DD2.GIF    from Evolution Dino-Dudes
                 AT_L1.GIF
             and ATBEAM.GIF from Tiny Toon Adventures

A note about viewing these files: Please remember that these screens
originally used hundreds of colors. If you view these files on a
system that can display less than 256 colors on-screen, you will lose
much of their detail and brilliance.

As a extra-special bonus for the curious, we've included two IMG
picture files; one of the Jaguar logo, and one of a Jaguar System
Block Diagram. These files are courtesy (and copyright) of Atari Corp.

All of these files have been tested with GEMView 2.32, and we hope you
will enjoy them.

So here we have it, our (first?) Jaguar Special Edition. None of our
regular features are present, but they will all return in two weeks.
Just think of this as our "End of Summer" gift to you. (And a rest

for the crew.)

The Jaguar. The spotlight this week in the World Atari.

"In creating our 3DO technology, we aimed for a really big jump in
colors and animation performance.

"You can't establish a standard if another manufacturer has a
consumer device that's going to be better than yours next year. You
have to provide a performance level that puts the stake way out
there.... Then people don't bother to challenge it."

                                                    President & CEO
                                                    3DO


                            THE ATARI JAGUAR

Sunnyvale, CA - August 18, 1993 - Atari Corporation is aggressively
taking command of the consumer electronics market with the
introduction of the Atari Jaguar this Fall. "We believe that we have
taken a more substantial jump than 3DO has in bringing a better and
more affordable entertainment experience to the consumer market," said
Sam Tramiel, president of Atari.

While the spotlight has been shining brightly on the latest multimedia
craze, Atari Corporation has emerged with the ultimate interactive
home entertainment system: The 64-bit Atari Jaguar. At around $200,
the 64-bit Jaguar outperforms the $700 32-bit 3DO system by a factor
of 2.

Consumers will see the difference in the Jaguar's vivid screen
imagery, most notably featuring over 16 million colors (16,777,216 to
be exact) in 32-bit true color graphics. The Jaguar produces 3D
Polygons for manipulation in a 3D world in real time. Animation
capabilities are in excess of 850 million pixels per second, creating
superior special effects and real time texture mapping. Using 55 MIPS,
speed and motion are unequaled with no constraints as to how fast or
restricted screen objects can move.

"The imagery is something that needs to be seen to be believed," said
Sam Tramiel, president of Atari. "Imagery is one thing, but wait until
you see how you can interact with these images."

The Jaguar has full three-dimensional capabilities, with three-
dimensional models that can rotate, be wildly distorted and even be
texture mapped. Lighting sources can be defined so that objects are
illuminated appropriately and at differing intensities, depending on
the light intensity and its distance. With the full 16 megabits of
system RAM available for game usage i.e., no needless operating system
overhead, speed will be superior to other consumer entertainment
experiences.

The Jaguar's sound system is based on Atari's proprietary, high speed
Digital Signal Processor, with 16-bit stereo CD quality sound output.
This allows for extremely realistic sounds, including human voices,
cars racing, jets soaring, worlds colliding, and more. The Jaguar's
synthesizer is used to create limitless boundaries in special effect
sounds and the dramatic use of music. Fidelity is far beyond coin
operated quality sound.

As a true multimedia platform, future applications for the Jaguar's
32-bit expansion port include connections into cable and telephone
networks; a digital signal processor port for modem use and connection
to digital audio peripherals such as DAT players. The Jaguar CD
peripheral is a most anticipated feature, with a fast dual speed drive
that can output data continuously at a rate of 350K bytes per second,
or run at normal audio rates of 175K per second. As well as being the
repository for almost 700 megabytes of video game storage, the Jaguar
CD Module is also being designed to interface with audio CD, Karaoke
CD, CD+Graphics and optional Kodak Photo CD. Atari also plans to
release an MPEG 2 cartridge which will allow users to play full length
motion pictures from CD.

With the Jaguar CD-ROM drive comes the ability to deliver full-screen,
full-color, full-motion video. Jaguar uses a video decompression
system licensed from SuperMac Technologies called CinePakø. The system
permits over sixty minutes of video to be stored on a single compact
disk (sic) and allows a game to use these video sequences at 30 frames
a second. The result of this combination of technologies is to provide
movie quality pictures that may be overlaid on the screen with
computer generated graphics if the game demands it.

Also included with the game is a high performance, ergonomically
designed, Controller with Joypad, three fire buttons, Pause, Option,
and a 12 key keypad with game specific overlays.

IBM Corporation's Charlotte, North Carolina, facility will manufacture
the Jaguar. They will be responsible for component sourcing,
assembling, quality testing, packaging, and distribution of the
Jaguar, which will be made in the United States. This fall, the Jaguar
will be introduced into the New York and San Francisco markets
followed by a national roll-out next year.

"As an American company we are in support of utilizing domestic
manufacturing," said Tramiel. "We are proud that the Jaguar is made in
the U.S.A."

       ----------------------------------------------------------------

The main features of the Jaguar are:

    ˘   64-bit RISC-based multiprocessing architecture.

    ˘   A very high speed 106.4 Mbyte/sec 64-bit Data path.

    ˘   27 MIPs Graphic Processor with 4K bytes of zero wait-state
        internal SRAM that is closely coupled with the Blitter that
        can perform a full range of graphics effects (including
        shading and rotations) at high speed yet is programmable for
        maximum flexibility.

    ˘   A programmable Object Processor that can act as a variety of
        different video architectures, such as an advanced sprite
        engine, pixel-mapped based systems, character mapped based
        systems and many others.

    ˘   27 MIPs Digital Signal Processor with 8K bytes of zero
        wait-state internal SRAM for CD quality sound and full stereo
        capabilities.

    ˘   A Blitter that can perform a full range of logical operations
        at high speed with hardware support for Z-buffering and
        Gouraud shading.

    ˘   MC68000 CPU clocked at 13.3 MHz as a general purpose control
        processor.

    ˘   Lifelike quality 32-bit color on NTSC or PAL television
        screens, yielding greater than 16 million colors.

    ˘   ROM Cartridge capacity to 48 Megabits of compressed or
        uncompressed code. When compressed, equivalent to almost 400
        Megabits.

    ˘   16 Megabits of fast page-mode DRAM.

    ˘   An optional double speed CD-ROM drive.

    ˘   ComLynx I/O for networked multiconsole games.

    ˘   Two (expandable to literally dozens) enhanced Controller
        Ports, supporting digital and analog interfaces, as well as
        keyboards, lightguns and mice.

    ˘   High performance, ergonomically designed, Controller with
        Joypad, 3 firebuttons, Pause, Option, and 12-key keypad with
        game-specific overlays.

    ˘   High speed synchronous serial port for connection to modems,
        cable TV networks and other high performance networks.

From a user's perspective, the Atari Jaguar has been designed to be a
consumer-oriented, affordable, state-of-the-art entertainment system.
It is capable of exquisite graphic interaction and displays, together
with CD quality sound. From a developer's point of view, Jaguar is a
special purpose multi-processor computer that lends itself perfectly
to the design and implementation of complex entertainment and
educational programs in a development environment that is easy to
learn.

The Jaguar's features include the ability to draw over 16 Million
colors and generate stereo sound of CD quality. In addition, multiple
manipulatable Objects can be defined to be almost any size, from
sprite-like elements, to screen sized playfields. Jaguar's graphics
processors are capable of scaling, rotating and shading bit-mapped
and polygon images. Jaguar is a true multimedia machine that supports
cartridges, CD ROM, CD Audio, CD+G, full motion video, virtual
reality and networking.

The architecture of the Jaguar allows for high speed interactivity
between four specialized processors embedded in two custom chips,
code named Tom and Jerry. As a result, the Jaguar is a high
performance system that distributes the processing workload among
various specialized system components, creating the overall
spectacular performance Jaguar achieves.

On cartridges, Jaguar supports an enhanced JPEG image decompression
mechanism (JagPEG). The CD-ROM software uses CinePakø full motion
video decompression, licensed from SuperMac Technologies.

For the technologically minded, it is important to note that the
heart of a video game system does not lie in the individual
components. The meshing of those components in the system itself is
of significance due to the crucial nature of bus bandwidth. The 68000
processor requires a bandwidth of about seven megabytes per second
while a true color display (NTSC or PAL) requires a further nine
megabytes per second. The Digital Signal Processor uses less than
half a megabyte per second to play back sampled sound. This means
that almost 85% of the bandwidth is available for the burst
activities that the system needs to perform. This incredible
bandwidth is key to Jaguar's performance.

"We believe that this truly 'places the stake' over twice as far as
3DO has, at a price that consumers can actually afford," said Bill
Rehbock, director of application software, in charge of third party
licensing for the Jaguar.

Users and developers alike will reap the rewards provided by the
Jaguar system's programmable special effects capabilities. Users will
delight in the ultra realism seen in computer generated images, from
shadowing and depth distortion to three dimensional movement. And
game designers will be both challenged and excited by the unlimited
possibilities.

Some of the effects that can be created are:

    Texture Mapping:    A simple or complex image can be "wrapped"
                        onto any two or three dimensional structure.
                        This allows for an unlimited number of
                        textures and images that can be made part of
                        the surface of complex objects.

    Morphing:           Animate and inanimate objects can be modified
                        smoothly so that they appear to be
                        transformed from one image to another. A frog
                        can become a prince, a lamp may transform
                        into a genie and a battleship can turn into a
                        submarine; all in real-time. This effect was
                        made popular by the blockbuster motion
                        picture, "Terminator 2" and Michael Jackson's
                        music video, "Black and White."

    Warping:            Any image can be stretched, pulled, rotated or
                        skewed in any way the programmer requires.
                        This allows very real simulations of the
                        interaction between physical objects such as a
                        football bouncing off the ground. It also
                        permits the easy creation of cartoon-like
                        imagery.

    Lighting:           Single or multiple sources of lighting can be
                        defined. The system will automatically
                        illuminate objects based on their location
                        relative to the light source(s). This creates
                        realistic shading unsurpassed by any current
                        video game manufacturer.

    Transparency:       Use of the transparency feature makes it
                        simple to create effects that are normally
                        complex to generate. For example, smoke and
                        shadows can be made part of any game
                        scenario, adding realism to the game
                        experience.

With this Fall's introduction of the Atari Jaguar, the ultimate video
game system and the nation's first 64-bit interactive multimedia
entertainment system, comes a plethora of both new and familiar game
titles. While third party developers and publishers are actively
designing software for the system, Atari programmers overseas and
domestically have been developing and fine-tuning several titles for
the Jaguar for release this year.

The dramatic use of 3D rendering and 24-bit graphics is most
prevalent in games seen on the Jaguar system. Scanned and digitized
character images, as well as detailed texture mapping, lighting and
shadowing effects and unrestricted motion and speed all contribute to
the next level of technology apparent in these games. And the 16-bit
stereo capabilities and high fidelity CD quality sound combined with
the imagery produce extraordinary results.

Some of the titles include:

Crescent Galaxyø - Lifelike three dimensionally rendered and shadowed
planetary objects and lifeforms prevail in this multi-leveled side
shooter. You are the young Corporal Trevor McFur of the Circle Reserve
Core. Returning from a deep space reconnaissance mission, you and your
shipmate intercept a long-range transmission telling you that you are
the only hope in saving the galaxy against a ruthless creature. The
game is visually stunning with full textured 3D renderings of
creatures and planets with nine levels reflecting five different
worlds. Enemies and allies include: Pop-up Poppies which explode when
they sense an enemy nearby; Geysers which can spurt forth abrupt
blasts of nuclear steam erupting from the Planets core; and bothersome
creatures such as Skeletal Vultures, Scorpions and Flying Dinos and
dozens more.

Cybermorphø - Surreal landscapes colored in both muted and bright
tones are the background for this One-Man Rescue Probe sent into an
interplanetary battlefield to rescue stranded survivors of a dying
war. The Cybermorph is an adaptable, flexible machine with an outer
skin programmed to react to its environment. If accelerating, it grows
streamlined to reduce resistance; when banking, its wings extend to
give maximum turn; when slowing up, the rear of the craft morphs into
a cowl to bring the speed down quickly and smoothly. The probe flies
in a full three dimensional world environment. The object is to fly
over the surface of each world in a low-altitude, high speed craft
saving helpless survivors and avoiding surface and air attack and
alien infestation. You defend yourself by shooting anything that moves
and avoid being hit yourself or colliding into tall landscape
features. A holographic face speaks to you giving you information.
Following lifeline sensors, you race toward the cries for help,
saving survivors from all 50 moons to complete the mission.

Raidenø - As the ultimate arcade game conversion, the Jaguar version
is considered the ideal soundalike and lookalike Raiden game. As a
vertical scroller, you control aircraft flying over enemy territory,
shooting militaristic tanks and aircraft, avoiding enemy gun fire and
hidden missiles. This full-featured game makes use of the graphic
capabilities with complex parallax scrolling and realistic and
engaging audio quality. This was essentially developed as a yardstick
for performance, color and sprite comparisons to showcase the Jaguar's
capabilities. Speed and motion are exceptional with no slow down when
mass objects are present on the screen. No other system comes close to
accurately converting this arcade game to a home console.

Evolution-Dino Dudesø - Familiar to consumers as Dinolympicsø on the
Lynx or as Humansø on the PC, this title is an Atari-owned property
which, seen on the Jaguar, utilizes all the graphics and colors Jaguar
can represent. Vivid colors and creative use of animation facilities
enhance the overall look of the game, but the 80 levels of play make
this challenging as well. As a platform puzzle game, cavemen
characters are taught to survive, by avoiding man-eating dinosaurs,
discovering the spear, making fire and physically running, jumping and
climbing their way up the evolutionary ladder.

Club Driveø - The most exciting vacation park in the 21st century is
the theme for this pulse quickening excursion. At this fantasy driving
resort, all vehicles are indestructible, and visitors can challenge
their skills and courage by driving some of the most treacherous
terrain and returning completely unscathed. Different levels are
represented by a futuristic city, an old western town, a present day
world and even a toy car world where you can drive in and around your
furniture at breakneck speeds as if you were inside a toy racing car.
This true 3D polygon environment is completely new to the gaming
world.

Checkered Flag IIø - Jaguar Formula One Racing hits its peak with this
version using real-time 3D generated action, akin to arcade quality
racing games. Cars, buildings and roads are rendered in true 3D, with
options to customize your car. The game features 100% true sound
effects; crashes are realistic in both sound and imagery, with parts
flying and tires screeching. Racing speed is markedly intensified.

Tiny Toon Adventuresø - Based on the popular Warner Bros. characters,
this platform game utilizes the vibrant colors and graphics to the
utmost. The storyline follows Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny and Plucky Duck
as they embark on a rescue mission to save the planet Aurica. Bad boy
Montana Max has a new toy: an Acme TiToonium-Gold Converter. The only
place to get TiToonium is on the planet Aurica. The removal of
TiToonium is causing grave ecological damage to Aurica. Armed with
Acme Crazy Net, our heroes try to shut down the Acme TiToonium-Gold
Converter. The object is to navigate through each level, locate the
TiToonium Extractor within each level and pull the plug on it. With a
transport beam pad, one of our heroes can be selected to climb, jump
and run through each level so in the end, the planet can be saved.

Alien vs. Predatorø - Based on two 20th Century Fox feature film
blockbusters, what would happen if the Alien, the Predator and a
colonial Marine Corporal were put together? Who would win? You select
who you will portray and the qualities each possesses is incorporated
into your strategy. For instance, if you were the Alien, you could
climb walls; as the Predator, your night vision is superior and as the
Marine Corporal, you may be able to outwit the other two with your
computer skills. Placed in realistic texture mapped corridors, your
movement is put in real-time action. Camera speeds race as you're
being chased down hallways with a high frame rate. Exceptional colors
and shadow effects put you right into the action.

Kasumi Ninjaø - The game is set on the small island of Kasumi in the
West Pacific rim. The Kasumi Ninja are the world's finest Ninja
warriors and a mist of invisibility from the Ninja Gods hides Kasumi
from the world. Kasumi is undetectable, even by radar. The Gods have
decided to intervene when Gyaku, a strong warrior, kills his family
and the Gods must find a new strong warrior to battle him. But first,
this new young Ninja must learn new skills and fight with nine other
persona, each with unique martial arts abilities and special moves.
The game incorporates superior graphics and animation with realistic
landscapes and backgrounds. Ninja warriors utilize 91 different
martial arts movements, with all the sound effects and audio
consistent with this type of fighting.

Tempest 2000ø - This title is familiar to gamers as the favorite
arcade classic using vector graphics, polygons and rapid fire. Here,
the Jaguar version incorporates a starfield in the background instead
of just a black background. CD quality stereo enhances this game
tenfold as this fast-paced energetic game unfolds. Manipulative
abilities have been modernized and updated with new features that
include spins and twists not seen in the 80's, as well as an updated
version to the year 2000 which takes full advantage of the Jaguar's 3D
graphic polygon capabilities.
