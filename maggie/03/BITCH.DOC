                                       GIGABYTE, ULM, REPLICANTS) 
                         Reviewed (biestly) by Michael Schuessler

     Well,  I hope that it is not going to be too biest. First of 
all I want to apologize for this article being rather short ! For 
that I have to say that the article was already written the first 
time  about one month ago (at that time it was about  10  screens 
pages  long) but then strangely enough disappeared from  my  hard 
disk.  As  I have some spare time now,  I have decided to  review 
this great demo again, but this time a lot shorter. 

     The  demo  comes  on a single sided disk  and  runs  on  any 
computer, even the STE (the disk contains tons of data). The demo
is a joined product by some of the most famous groups on the  ST. 
It  is also the FIRST REAPPEARANCE of TEX and the  GYGABYTE  CREW 
after the Amiga Demo.   The demo contains about 6 screens  9can't 
exactly  remember how many as I haven't looked at it for  such  a 
long time). The in between loader is very simple, there is simply 
some text saying PLEASE WAIT with some colour bars in it bouncing 
up and down. 


THE MAIN MENU:
The main menu is not clever,  BUT it is extremely funny. There is 
the  Lost Boys logo on the top of the screen wobbling about  from 
the  left to the right.  Further down in the middle there is  the 
selector,  you simply use the cursor keys in order to scroll some 
text  up and down.  By pressing the space bar you can access  the 
the various screens.  Around this selector there are some sprites   
flying about saying Life's a Bitch.  At the bottom of the screen, 
in  the  bottom  border,  there is the  all  so  famous  megadeth 
scroller.  The  best bit of the screen is still  missing,  the  4 
track sampled tune ! This tune deals with Michael Bi-bibibBittner
(a member of the TNT crew).  The tune is called the bittner  mix. 
There is a lot of sampled speech going on,  like:  I THINK I HAVE 
TO PUKE !   THERE ARE NO ERRORS IN MY CODE and some puking sound. 
All the phrases are in German, but still the tune is great ! 

 
BEAT-NICK SCREEN:
This screen is fairly similar to the intro from Maggie  2.0.  but 
this  time the shapes are a lot faster and they are also  running 
in 50 Hz. 

Then there is the FULLSCREEN BY ULM:
This  is a great fullscreen,  an enormous scrolline going  across 
all  the borders and also bouncing up and down.  The entire  blue 
background is also wobbling about. Along with all that there is a 
great sample playing which is extremely clear. 


THE REPLICANTS FULLSCREEN:
This fullscreen only goes across the left and right  border,  BUT 
let  me assure you,  this is definitely enough !  There are  some 
vertical colour bars !  Yes, I said vertical colour bars and they 
even  wobble  to  the left and to the right !  There  are  a  few 
different wave forms preset for you to enjoy this great game with 
the colours !!  This screen is a great pleasure for the eye !


THE GIGA-TEX SCREEN:
The screen starts off with some AK sign spinning about.  Later on 
there are are some small afterburner sprites at the bottom of the 
screen, then there are millions of sprites flying about which can 
be  controlled (I think).  After a while the Afterburner  sprites 
disappear and a scroller appears instead of them!


This is it for the very quick review of the Bitch demo,  it might 
be  that I have missed a screen which would be tuff luck,  but  I 
think that you can already see that the demo is extremely good !
