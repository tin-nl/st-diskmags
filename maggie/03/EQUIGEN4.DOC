                              REVIEWED BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

I  HAVE NO IDEA WHO HAS DONE THE DEMO AS I DID NOT HAVE THE  TIME 
TO READ THE SCROLLS, SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT IT IS BY EQUINOX BUT I 
AM NOT SURE. SOORY ABOUT THAT.

This  review here will be pretty short as I am rather  tired  due 
to a late last night,  or should I rather say morning.  Well,  at 
about  2.00 am I was phoned up and asked whether or not  I  would 
like to come on a conference line. As I am currently on holiday i 
decided that it would be quite a good idea. There is nothing much 
to tell so I will continue with the actual review.

It loads quite quickly ,  flickers for an instant and here it is, 
the main menu of the Equinox Gen 4 demo.  The main menu  consists 
of fullscreen overscan with a piece of graffix on the top and the 
bottom  telling  the audience that the demo was written  for  the 
magazine  Generation 4.  In between the graffix one can  see  the 
keys  that  can be pressed for the various screens.  All  in  all 
there are 5 keys (keys F1 to F5) which can be pressed.

F1:  The  Sound Tracker Screen (I think that that's what  it  was 
                                called)
When  a screen loads there is just a piece of text in a  standard 
Atari font saying the obvious word "Loading".
This  is probably the best screen in the demo,  at least  on  the 
visual  side  of  things.  There  are  three  layers  of  graffix 
paralaxing vertically. The colours chosen or the graffix has been 
done  very well for my taste.  This parallaxing takes up a  touch 
more than 3 quarters of the screen.  There is a piece of  graffix 
on top of the parallaxing background but I can't remember what it 
says,  so you will have to see for yourself. At the bottom of the 
screen there is the usual scroller.


F2: I have no idea what this screen is called
This  screen  is  pretty boring,  there is only  a  big  scroller 
(normal  screen size) and within this there are different  layers 
of  paralaxing  bubbles or at least some kind  of  balls.  That's 
already it with this screen, so can you see why I think that this 
screen contains nothing interesting. 


F3: Same as the above
I quite like this screen although it contains nothing special  or 
is it because these guys have greeted me (anyway,  thanks for the 
greet  guys!!!)?.  The  top part of the screen is used  for  some 
sinus dots bouncing/flying about. When one watches the screen for 
some time one will realize that there is a 3615 Gen 4 sign fading 
in and out on top of the sinus dots occasionally.  Anyway, moving 
a  bit further down the screen there are some nice steady  colour 
bars  indicating  a sun set with a dinosaur stretching  from  the 
left to the right of the screen!!  Starting on the right side  of 
the  screen on the dinosaur's tale there is a scroller  going  up 
its  back and disappearing on the other side of the by  scrolling 
over the head.     This dinosaur scroll, as I have just named it, 
contains only the greetings and is again standard Atari ST font.

 
F4:
As all the screens in this demo this next screen is good but does 
not contain anything revolutionary new. At the back of the screen 
there  are  some mountains and in the front one can see  the  sea 
with  it's  waves  moving forwards  and  backwards.  The  picture 
reminded me a bit of Spy vs Spy III in the Antarctic.  Anyway,  I 
don't  think  that the screen is supposed to give  it's  audience 
this impression,  because there is a scoller which climbs out  of 
the  water and forms a circle before it disappears in  the  water 
again.  To make the scroller look more interesting,  some  colour 
bars  have  been  implemented.  To  make  the  screen  even  more 
interesting the scroller has a shadow on the water which actually 
look rather nice. 

F5: The Last screen (this is not the actual name)
The  screen has been devided up into 4 parts and in each  one  of 
these parts there is a piece of graffix saying Generation 4. This 
various pieces scroll a bit to the left,  then to the right, then 
scroll another big bit to the right, then come back a bit,.......
Occasionally  there is a sign which says 3615 fading in and  out. 
And that was it for the last screen.

I  have no idea where I put it when I came back from Marseille  I 
will have to go on the QUEST OF THE LOST PASSPORT.
