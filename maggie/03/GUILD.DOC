
                              GUILD OF THIEVES
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PULL ROPE and then  WEST. You're  carrying  a  Swag  Bag. OPEN
BAG THEN LOOK IN IT will show you that you have 
the  indispensable tool of all Adventurers,  The  Lamp!  LOOK  IN 
POCKET and you will find that you also have a plastic card  which 
might  come in handy later.  Meager pickings,  but we've  started 
with less!  WEST again will take you to an area where you'll spot 
an  old  man  struggling along with  a  trunk. 
HELP MAN. In fact, if you don't, you'll never get into the castle 
and you'll fail miserably! You and the old man will end up at the 
castle where the gatekeeper will lower the drawbridge for the old 
man,  who will disappear inside with the trunk,  never to be seen 
again. As a matter of interest, before helping him, you might ask 
him about the trunk,  the castle and the baron.  With the  castle 
invitingly  open,  you  can go NORTH where you'll be met  by  the 
gatekeeper who will deposit you in the Entrance Hall.  Along  the 
way,  he will tell you about his favorite hobby,  Rat Racing, and 
promise to let you know when the race is about to begin. A couple 
of  notes  here.  The rat race is variable and  will  take  place 
sometime  in  the  next  20-60  moves.  You  have  to  be  either 
downstairs or in the corridor upstairs in order to hear him shout 
at you. If you miss his warning, the race will take place without 
you  and  you will not be able to win any money (which  you  need 
desperately.)
This  walkthru is written from a LOGICAL  standpoint.  There  are 
faster  ways to complete the game without backtracking,  but  you 
would have to do things without knowing WHY you were doing them.
Okay, we're alone now, so let's start exploring. Go WEST into the 
Lounge  and  the only interesting thing you'll see is  a  bucket. 
LOOK IN BUCKET and TAKE COAL that you'll find there.  BREAK  COAL 
and you'll discover a fossil.  Not the most exciting thing in the 
world,  but we'll keep it anyway.  Now SOUTH to the Gallery. Here 
we'll  discover three paintings,  each important in its own  way. 
EXAMINE PAINTINGS and TAKE OIL PAINTING since it's described as a 
classic and is,  no doubt,  valuable.  The watercolor depicts  an 
interesting  scene  --  keep  it in  mind  for  future  reference 
especially  the words.  The gaudy painting doesn't look  like  it 
belongs here.  If you move it,  you'll discover a safe here;  but 
since you are not,  and never will be,  a safecracker,  leave  it 
alone. It's not important.
SOUTH again will take you into the Drawing Room.  The red leather 
settee  is  obviously out of place,  and if  you  EXAMINE  SETTEE 
you'll  find a cushion.  OPEN CUSHION THEN LOOK IN IT and  you'll 
find a Note.  (Remember,  this is a British creation,  a Note  is 
money, not something you read!) TAKE NOTE then go NORTH twice and 
EAST to the Entrance Hall.  This is a good,  central location  to 
dump  stuff.  Unfortunately,  there is no Legless Horse  in  this 
game,  and the swag bag is definitely NOT bottomless.  Going EAST 
will  take  you to the Dining Hall where you'll see a Bear  in  a 
cage.  Also  in the cage is a Platinum Chalice,  and  there's  no 
question  that  THIS is a treasure!  Unfortunately  the  cage  is 
locked, and the bear looks testy anyway so leave it for now.
SOUTH  again  will take you to the Kitchen.  The  cupboard  looks 
inviting,  so  OPEN CUPBOARD AND LOOK IN IT and you'll find  some 
rat poison and a jam jar.  TAKE ALL FROM CUPBOARD and head  SOUTH 
again to the Servant's Quarters. OPEN CABINET THEN LOOK IN IT and 
you'll find a key.  TAKE KEY then SOUTH again to the gatekeeper's 
Bedroom.  If you LOOK UNDER BED you'll find a tub.  OPEN TUB THEN 
LOOK  IN IT and you'll find a Maggot.  Yeecchhh!  But it must  be 
useful,  so  TAKE  TUB.  
About this time you should hear the gatekeeper shout that the rat 
race  will  start  soon.  Go NORTH three times and  WEST  to  the 
Entrance Hall.  DROP ALL BUT NOTE AND SWAG BAG.  (You don't  want 
the gatekeeper to know you're a thief,  do you?) Besides,  if you 
try to pass the gatekeeper with any treasures,  the results  will 
be fatal!  Now SOUTH to the Courtyard.  The gatekeeper will begin 
setting up for the race,  so WAIT.  He will then ask you if you'd 
like to bet and give you the odds.  This MIGHT be a variable, but 
every time I played,  the Grey rat had the longest odds.  In  any 
event  bet  on the rat with the longest odds (you  need  lots  of 
money!).  So BET ON GREY RAT WITH NOTE.  You'll be treated to  an 
exciting  description of the first race at Santa  Courtyard;  but 
never fear, your rat will win.
The gatekeeper will give you a VERY dubious looking cheque (check 
to you Americans),  but it's all you'll get so settle for it.  He 
will then depart, leaving a birdcage behind. Leave it for now. 
Time  to  explore  some other areas and get  some  background  on 
what's  going on here.  Go SOUTH (don't ever spend more than  one 
move  at the Gatehouse unless you are talking to the  gatekeeper. 
He will escort you back to the Drawing Room if you do.  SOUTH and 
WEST twice to the Cave Entrance.  Now GET LAMP AND LIGHT  IT,  it 
gets pretty dark in these caves. 
WEST again will take you to the Junction Chamber,  from which all 
roads lead.  We'll try SOUTHEAST first.  Here at the fork in  the 
road  you'll find an iron gate to the southeast.  OPEN GATE  THEN 
SOUTHEAST and you'll see a gravedigger plying his  trade.  Ignore 
him,  he's pretty morose.  EXAMINE YEW TREE and you'll spot  some 
berries.   You  might  get  hungry  later  so  GET  BERRIES  then 
NORTHWEST.  Now SOUTH to the Undertaker's Parlor.  It's locked up 
tight  (no,  the key won't work here) but that shouldn't  stop  a 
Thief.  BREAK  WINDOW and SOUTH and you're in!  There's a  casket 
here,  which is useless.  You'll notice the counter has a flap in 
it,  so LIFT FLAP and SOUTH.  The only thing of interest here  is 
the Till.  You'll find a button, so PUSH BUTTON THEN LOOK IN TILL 
and you'll find a coin! GET COIN then NORTH twice and WEST.

Here's  the  "Ba k of Ker vn a." If you READ NOTICE  you'll  find 
that the bank is closed due to no business.  Don't bother  trying 
to break in.  You can't.  We'll get it open another way. The bank 
is closed because the Thieves, who used to deposit all their loot 
here,  have gone away, and there's no business. Maybe you can fix 
this.  You'll  also find a night deposit safe here.  What we  are 
going to do is deposit all our treasures in the Bank in the hopes 
that it will reopen.

Okay, now that you know what to do with your treasures, let's get 
down  to  some serious hunting.  From the Bank  go  EAST,  NORTH, 
NORTHWEST to the Junction.  To the southwest you'll see some very 
large,  substantial looking iron bars blocking your way. Just for 
kicks,  try  BREAK  BARS.  Aha!  Just as  you  thought,  the  old 
Polystyrene-Bars-That-Look-Like-Iron  trick!  Now  SOUTHWEST  and 
you'll find a skeleton.  EXAMINE SKELETON and you'll find it  has 
one  of  its finger bones resting on a chest.  Just to  be  safe, 
let's  GET FINGER AND CHEST.  Then OPEN CHEST AND LOOK IN IT  and 
you'll find a heart.  (Where ELSE would you expect a heart to be, 
but in a chest? Isn't British humor wunnerful?)

Now  go  SOUTH  and you'll find yourself up to your  knees  in  a 
stream.  Follow  it WEST to the Top of the waterfall.  There's  a 
rope ladder here and if you EXAMINE LADDER you'll find it's  tied 
in a tight ball.  UNTIE LADDER and the ladder will unroll.  Don't 
bother going down -- there's nothing you can do down there now.

Go EAST,  NORTH, NORTHEAST then EAST four times then SOUTH to the 
Wheatfield.  You'll see a windmill operating in the distance.  If 
you  try to talk to the Miller he won't hear you because  of  the 
windmill.  So SHOUT HELLO and the Miller will answer.  Then SHOUT 
STOP WINDMILL and he'll shut it down.

Now SOUTH and sit down to talk with the Miller.  He'll give you a 
piece of gum which you should keep for future reference.  If  you 
ASK MILLER ABOUT LUTE that he's playing with, he'll tell you that 
the salesman told him it was magic.  You can ask him about a  few 
things you're interested in,  and eventually he'll tell you  he's 
tired  of  the Lute and wants to sell it.  BUY LUTE  WITH  CHEQUE 
(careful  of  the spelling) and you'll be the proud  owner  of  a 
magical (?) instrument.

Lutes are VERY delicate, so PUT LUTE IN BAG and NORTH. Whooooops! 
It's  a good thing you protected the Lute,  you clumsy  oaf!  Now 
WEST,  NORTH four times.  As you go through the courtyard, you'll 
probably see a description of fish jumping. Keep that in mind. In 
the Entrance Hall GET LUTE and DROP LUTE, BERRIES, CHEST AND GUM. 
Now let's check out the upstairs.

UP  and WEST will take you into the Library.  EXAMINE  DESK  will 
show  you  a  paperback and a  box.  READ  PAPERBACK  and  you'll 
discover that your instincts were right:  the fossil IS valuable. 
EXAMINE  BOX  and you'll find the outlines  of  a  heart,  spade, 
diamond and club. Now OPEN BOX and inside you'll find three cards 
and a joker.  This is VERY IMPORTANT. Pay attention to which suit 
is NOT represented in the box (it's a variable);  this will  save 
your  life  later.  You can DROP BOX because you  won't  need  it 
anymore.  Now  you  can  READ BOOK.  You will get  a  variety  of 
interesting topics,  all of them variable.  Among them you should 
find one that tells you that rats can't swim,  another that tells 
you how to make a fishing pole out of a piece of wood, thread and 
needle or pin.  Many of the books will give hints as to things to 
come in the game while others are useless. 

When you're tired of reading, go EAST (ignore the bathroom to the 
North of here),  EAST and NORTH to the Billiard Room. GET CUE and 
then EXAMINE BILLIARD TABLE.  You'll see three balls of different 
descriptions on the table.  Now HIT (color) BALL WITH  CUE.  This 
may  or may not be a variable (it was always the Red ball  in  my 
game),  but one of the balls will refuse togo in a straight line. 
GET RED BALL (or whatever) AND OPEN IT and you'll find a diamond! 
DROP BALL but keep the cue -- it's a multi-purpose tool!

Now EAST into the Music Room and you'll see an interesting stool. 
OPEN  STOOL THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll find a  plastic  bag.  GET 
PLASTIC  BAG THEN EXAMINE IT and you'll find a valuable  original 
manuscript!  Now  SOUTH  twice to the Spare  Bedroom.  There's  a 
wealth of important stuff here. First LOOK IN BED and you'll find 
a  Sewing Box.  GET BOX THEN OPEN IT and you'll see  some  cotton 
with  a needle.  Now LOOK UNDER BED and you'll find a china  pot. 
GET  POT.  Now  OPEN WARDROBE THEN LOOK IN IT and  you'll  see  a 
designer dress.  TAKE DRESS.  This throws a lot of people off the 
track.  The china pot and designer dress are BOTH treasures, even 
though they don't look like much.

We've  looted this room pretty good so go NORTH,  WEST twice  and 
SOUTH  twice  to the Main Bedroom.  There is  a  strange  looking 
painting  over the bed,  so GET PAINTING THEN DROP IT.  It's  not 
valuable,  but you'll see a hole in the wall. Looking through the 
hole  will show you a light a LONG way off,  so I wouldn't  enter 
the hole if I were you. You need a way to get across the chasm to 
the  light.  There's a mirror on the cabinet,  so GET MIRROR  and 
then OPEN CABINET AND LOOK IN IT.  You'll see a plaque there; and 
if you READ PLAQUE,  you'll find two buttons and the  information 
that this is a folding bed. Being a very ingenious kind of thief, 
you know immediately what to do, right?

SIT  ON  BED.  Now you can't reach the  buttons  from  here,  but 
remember the cue?  PUSH TOP BUTTON WITH CUE and Wheeee! You're in 
the  Secret  Laboratory.  If you LOOK IN CAULDRON you'll  find  a 
sachet.  EXAMINE SACHET and you'll find that you better not  open 
it until you're ready to use it. Since you have no idea what it's 
good  for,  better  leave  it for now.  There's  only  one  other 
significant thing here: the diary. READ DIARY and you'll have an
idea  what the sachet is for,  but you still will have to  figure 
out the other ingredients.  The word "distasteful" gives you some 
ideas,  though,  huh?  

There's  nothing  else to be done here right now so go  WEST  and 
you'll  find  yourself magically back in the  Main  Bedroom.  Now 
North  twice and DOWN.  GET THE PAINTING AND FOSSIL,  then  EAST, 
SOUTH and EAST again to the Gloomy Passage.  OPEN DOOR and  NORTH 
and you'll be at the top of a flight of stairs.  The cellar below 
is infested with rats;  but no matter how hard you try, you can't 
get the rat poison where it will do any good.  On the south  wall 
is  a  drainage  system  consisting  of  a  stopcock  and   pipe. 
Remembering  what  the book said about rats  and  swimming,  OPEN 
STOPCOCK  and you'll hear water gurgling down the  pipe.  But  we 
want  the  water in the cellar so GET PIPE and  the  cellar  will 
start to flood.

WAIT  one turn for the cellar to become half flooded  then  CLOSE 
STOPCOCK.  Now  you can safely go DOWN and EXAMINE  RACK.  You'll 
find two bottles there.  GET ALL FROM RACK and you'll end up with 
a red bottle and a Champagne bottle. EXAMINE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE and 
you'll find the instructions "Shake me,  say 'Hooray' and I  will 
explode." Something you'll probably want to remember later.  OPEN 
RED  BOTTLE THEN LOOK IN IT and you'll find some wineand a  ruby! 
GET  RUBY THEN DROP BOTTLE.  (I suppose you can drink the  wineif 
you really WANT to.)

Now UP and SOUTH twice to the Junk Room.  You'll see a cube here. 
It doesn't look very impressive,  but GET CUBE and then MOVE JUNK 
and  you'll find another exit.  Go SOUTH and you're  outside  the 
castle By The Moat. There is another of those Night Deposit Safes 
here.  It's  time to see if we can't help the local economy  (and 
ourselves).  OPEN SAFE then put the ruby, diamond, dress, plastic 
bag,  fossil,  painting and pot in the safe (you won'tbe able  to 
put them all in at the same time) then CLOSE SAFE.

Now NORTH twice,  EAST, NORTH twice and EAST. You've been working 
hard so it's time for a little recreation now.

If you were lucky in the Library,  you read a book that mentioned 
how  to make a fishing pole out of a piece of  wood,  thread  and 
pin.  If  not,  this  is something you just have  to  figure  out 
yourself.  The fish jumping in the moat in the courtyard is about 
the only other hint you have about fish.  You're going to have to 
deal  with the bear in the cage somehow,  and although  there  IS 
some honey available,  as far as I can tell there's no way to get 
it,  and  it  wouldn't accomplish the  purpose.  A  bear's  OTHER 
favorite food is fish!

GET  COTTON and then FIX COTTON TO CUE.  The syntax is  a  little 
tricky here,  and if you don't get it right,  the parser  doesn't 
understand  what you want to do.  Also,  DON'T remove the  needle 
from  the cotton...I could NEVER find a way to put it  back!  Now 
all  you need is bait,  so GET MAGGOT THEN PUT IT ON  NEEDLE  and 
you're all set!  Go SOUTH to the Courtyard and FISH IN MOAT.  You 
will  very  quickly catch a fish,  and the fact  that  it's  dead 
doesn't  matter.  (Dead mackeral maybe?) Anyway,  go  NORTH,  GET 
COTTON  FROM CUE,  DROP CUE AND COTTON.  Then GET POISON AND  PUT 
POISON  ON FISH.  Now go EAST to the Dining Room and UNLOCK  CAGE 
WITH KEY and then GIVE FISH TO BEAR.  The fish will work  wonders 
and then you can OPEN CAGE,  GET CHALICE,  CLOSE CAGE.  (I  don't 
know if the bear will ever wake up, but I don't believe in taking 
chances!

Now SOUTH, EAST, SOUTH, SOUTH and OPEN SAFE, PUT CHALICE IN SAFE, 
CLOSE SAFE. Then NORTH, NORTH, WEST, NORTH, WEST. GET JAM JAR and 
go NORTH once more. There is a stable door here. EXAMINE DOOR and 
you'll see a horseshoe.  Let's RUB HORSESHOE for good  luck.  You 
see a golden glow,  but nothing much else  happens.  Well,  maybe 
something good will happen later.  Now EAST to the stable. Simply 
OPEN  JAR and a fly will enter the jar and get stuck.  This  will 
come  in  handy later.  WEST,  SOUTH will take you  back  to  the 
entrance hall. We'll need a few supplies for our trip so DROP ALL 
then GET LAMP,  CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE,  COIN,  FINGER,  MIRROR,  CUBE, 
LUTE,  JAR AND GUM.  Now SOUTH,  GET CAGE and SOUTH  AGAIN,  WEST 
twice and NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST. There's a gem stuck in the wax in 
the ceiling,  but it's really pretty simple to get.  Just REFLECT 
BEAM AT WAX WITH MIRROR and the gem will fall.  CATCH GEM and you 
can  DROP MIRROR.  Now NORTHEAST and SOUTHEAST to  the  Junction. 

We're going to take a little unnecessary side trip here,  just so 
you  can see what is going on.  Go  SOUTHEAST,  SOUTH,  WEST  and 
you're in front of the bank.  READ NOTICE and you'll see that  it 
says "Closed due to lack of business." Now OPEN SAFE,  PUT GEM IN 
SAFE  and CLOSE SAFE.  Now WAIT one turn and you'll see a  little 
man come out and change the notice.  If you READ  NOTICE,  you'll 
see that it now says "Closed due to not much business." It  might 
be  fun later to save up all your treasures and bring  them  here 
and  deposit them one at a time,  and see how long it  takes  the 
little man to drop from exhaustion! Now EAST, NORTH, NORTHWEST to 
the Junction.

If you're not interested in watching the scenery just  described, 
you can bypass that and go directly to the Zoo and put the gem in 
the safe there.  From the Junction go NORTHEAST and you'll be  at 
the entrance to the Zoo. There's a toll gate here and you'll have 
to PUT COIN IN SLOT to get in. There is also a Night Deposit Safe 
here in which you can put the gem if you still have it.

Now EAST,  SOUTH and WEST will take you to the Insect House. Some 
vandals  have been at work here,  but read the plaque which  will 
tell  you that the snake (what's a snake cage doing in an  insect 
house?) who escaped likes cold climates. GET SNAKESKIN (you might 
want to make a wallet later) and then head EAST. 

Oops!  You seem to have a snake corset!  Not to  worry.  Remember 
that sign at the T-Junction which mentioned a Jungle? Jungles are 
HOT!  So  go NORTH twice and then WEST and the snake will  expire 
from heat stroke.  Now you're faced with a yucky spider,  but  if 
you DROP JAR, a sticky situation will be to your benefit.

Go EAST back to the T-Junction. There's an Aviary to the East but 
we'll forget it for now.  SOUTH, WEST, and SOUTHWEST will take us 
back to the Junction.

We're  going  to investigate another area now so go  EAST  twice, 
SOUTH twice,  WEST and SOUTH again and you're at the  Antechamber 
to the Temple.  There's another of those Night Safes here, a good 
sign that there might be treasure around!

SOUTH  again takes you into the temple.  Whatever you  do,  DON'T 
touch  the statue yet.  Instead EXAMINE ALTAR and you'll find  an 
Incense  Burner.  GET BURNER and you're ready to investigate  the 
other exits. There is nothing at the Northeast exit so ignore it. 
Go SOUTWEST,  UP and EAST and you'll find an organ. EXAMINE ORGAN 
then  GET ALL KEYS FROM ORGAN.  Now  WEST,  DOWN,  NORTHEAST  and 
SOUTH.  You'll see a beehive here.  EXAMINE HIVE and you'll  find 
that  it's closed and there are some gloves on it.  You can  open 
the hive and there is honey inside,  but I know of no way in  the 
world to get it,  and it isn't needed.  But the gloves might help 
so  GET GLOVES then NORTH,  SOUTHEAST and UP.  There's  an  ivory 
rhinoceros here,  and ivory is valuable,  so GET RHINOCEROS  then 
DOWN,  NORTHWEST and NORTHWEST again.  Then DOWN to an exit  with 
"WOBNIAR" above it.  If you're very observant, you'll notice that 
that  spells rainbow backwards.  Better SAVE the game  here,  one 
false step and you're a goner!

Those  of us who have played HOLLYWOOD HIJINX will  NEVER  forget 
the  order  of the colors of the rainbow.  For those of  you  who 
didn't,  they are Violet,  Indigo,  Blue,  Green, Yellow, Orange, 
Red.  You  must  pass through the following room by  stepping  on 
these colors in order.  Assuming it is NOT a variable (it was the 
same in every game I played) you should be able to get through by 
using this sequence: SOUTHEAST (Black), SOUTHEAST (Violet), NORTH 
(Indigo),  EAST (Blue),  EAST (Green),  SOUTHEAST (Yellow), SOUTH 
(Orange), SOUTHWEST (Red), EAST (White).

SOUTHEAST  will take you to the Crypt Room.  The  sarcophagus  is 
locked, and
what  better to open it with than a  skeleton  bone?  So,  UNLOCK 
SARCOPHAGUS WITH FINGER then OPEN SARCOPHAGUS. There's a skull in 
there, and if you EXAMINE SKULL, you'll find an eye in the skull. 
TAKE  SKULL THEN DROP FINGER.  There's nothing else  of  interest 
here so go EAST into the Shrine.  There's a statuette  here,  and 
although the description is pretty vague, it is valuable, so TAKE 
STATUETTE.  Now  there's a black door behind a  black  drape...so 
what  do you suppose would unlock it?  Right!  UNLOCK  DOOR  WITH 
EBONY KEY.  Now OPEN DOOR,  DROP EBONY KEY and go  EAST.  Nothing 
here  but  a  pamphlet,  so READ PAMPHLET  and  you'll  get  some 
valuable information about walking on coals. 

We're  done here so go WEST,  WEST,  and NORTHWEST to  the  white 
square.  Follow the rainbow colors to get out (not the reverse of 
the way you got it!).  From the white square:  NORTHWEST,  NORTH, 
NORTHWEST,  EAST,  SOUTHWEST,  SOUTHWEST, NORTHWEST, NORTH should 
put you on the black square.  Now NORTHWEST,  UP,  SOUTHEAST  and 
NORTH to the Antechamber. 

OPEN SAFE then PUT BURNER, STATUETTE AND RHINOCEROS IN SAFE, then 
CLOSE  SAFE and some more of your valuables have been  deposited. 
Now we're ready to tackle that statue.  Go SOUTH into the temple. 
Just for safety sake PUT LUTE IN SWAG BAG and then GET STATUE.

Now  you  know why I told you not to  touch  that  statue!  Don't 
panic,  though,  just WAIT one turn.  Now DROP STATUE (or  you'll 
drown) and NORTH three times which will put you on a sandy beach. 
GET  BROOCH  which is in plain sight and then  investigate  those 
lumps  in  the sand.  DIG IN SAND and you'll  find  some  wetsuit 
boots.  GET BOOTS.  Now go DOWN to the Thin Shaft.  If you try to 
enter  this shaft without the right equipment,  you'll  slip  and 
die,  so  WEAR BOOTS THEN DOWN and you'll make it  okay.  Now  go 
SOUTH.  You  see that rope?  Well,  you can't possibly  climb  it 
unless you WEAR GLOVES.  Now UP and GET PICK then DOWN and  WEST. 
Looks like these minerals might be valuable so GET MINERALS  WITH 
PICK.  You can now DROP PICK, GLOVES AND BOOTS and GET STONE. Now 
EAST and then SOUTH.

Does this look familiar?  Sure it does:  It's the rope ladder you 
let  down earlier;  good thing,  too!  So  UP,  EAST,  NORTH  and 
NORTHEAST and you're back in the cave at the good old Junction!

Now  we know what those succulents were for so back to  the  Zoo! 
NORTHEAST,  to the Safe.  OPEN SAFE THEN PUT BROOCH AND STONE  IN 
SAFE, then CLOSE SAFE. Now EAST and then SOUTH and we'll try that 
other  key.  UNLOCK DOOR WITH IVORY KEY then DROP KEY  THEN  OPEN 
DOOR.  Now EAST into the Office.  There's lots of stuff here, but 
ignore it all except the spade.  OPEN DRAWER THEN LOOK IN IT  and 
you'll  find a key and a magazine.  GET KEY AND SPADE  THEN  READ 
MAGAZINE  and you'll learn the feeding habits of the  Macaw.  Now 
OPEN DOOR and NORTHEAST to the White Corridor.  Then UNLOCK  DOOR 
WITH KEY,  OPEN DOOR, DROP KEY, then go NORTHWEST and CLOSE DOOR. 
There's  a noisy little Mynah bird here who can be of great  help 
to you.  OPEN CAGE, GET MYNAH, PUT MYNAH IN CAGE then CLOSE CAGE. 
Now you can OPEN DOOR and go SOUTHEAST,  SOUTHWEST,  WEST,  NORTH 
twice.  If  you get tired of hearing the Mynah  squawk,  you  can 
teach it to talk by saying MYNAH,  HELLO, or whatever you want it 
to say.  This will be crucial later.

Now go WEST and GET SUCCULENTS.  Then SHAKE PALM TREE and  you'll 
be rewarded with some Macaw food.  GET COCONUT.  (Don't shake the 
tree again,  or it will be fatal!).  Now EAST twice to he Aviary. 
There's  the bird you want,  and he'll tell you that he'll  trade 
some  information for food.  BREAK COCONUT WITH SPADE  THEN  DROP 
SPADE and then GIVE COCONUT TO MACAW and you'll be rewarded  with 
the ingredients for the Baron's secret formula.

Now we're ready to deal with those coals so go WEST, SOUTH, WEST, 
SOUTHWEST to the Junction and NORTHWEST twice. Now RUB SUCCULENTS 
ON FEET then go UP.  You made it!  DROP SUCCULENTS here and go UP 
again.  There's  nothing of interest in the Boathouse so just  go 
SOUTHEAST to the Yellow Room.  You probably should save the  game 
here in case you mess up the next part.

The secret to this puzzle is really simple if you explore all the 
rooms and draw a map. If you look at the map, you'll see that the 
five  rooms are laid out in the same pattern as the spots on  the 
face  of a die.  Dice are a very important part of the game  from 
here  on.  (Which is probably why they included that die  in  the 
package.)

GET YELLOW DIE then go SOUTHEAST.  There are rooms with a die  in 
each of the four corners of this White Room.  Get the three other 
die  and come back here.  Okay...now if you examine the slots  in 
the  opaque case,  you'll see that they are colored  Red,  Green, 
Blue,  and Yellow,  the same as the dice.  The dice you have  all 
have one spot on each face. They need to have a five on each face 
(the  pattern of the rooms).  So start with the Red Die and  ROLL 
DIE.  Wow!  That horseshoe was lucky,  after all! Okay, tell Lady 
Luck  FIVE.  Then PUT RED DIE IN RED SLOT.  Do the same with  the 
other  three  and  the case will no longer  be  locked!  Now  GET 
PLASTIC DIE.  Now I think it's time to start building the Baron's 
secret recipe.

From  the  White  Room go NORTHWEST  twice  then  DOWN.  Now  RUB 
SUCCULENTS  ON  FEET  (check to make sure  you  haven't  GOT  the 
succulents...you need them here,  but should be able to use  them 
without  picking them up.) Now DOWN,  SOUTHEAST twice and  you're 
back  at the junction.

Now go EAST twice,  NORTH twice.  At the Entrance Hall make  sure 
you have the cue, berries, heart, eye, cube and snakeskin. Now UP 
then SOUTH twice.  The bed which shot you into the Secret Lab  is 
still up against the wall, so PUSH BOTTOM BUTTON and the bed will 
return. Now SIT ON BED then PUSH TOP BUTTON WITH CUE. In the lab, 
GET  SACHET and then,  remembering what the Macaw told  you,  PUT 
HEART,  EYE,  SKIN, BERRIES IN CAULDRON. The diary said something 
about  symetrical  objects,  so PUT CUBE IN  CAULDRON.  Now  OPEN 
SACHET  and  the contents will turn into powder.  PUT  POWDER  IN 
CAULDRON  and when you LOOK IN CAULDRON,  you'll see an  anticube 
(which isn't there). GET ANTICUBE (don't
ask ME...I just work here!).

Now  WEST,  then NORTH,  NORTH,  DOWN.  We're about to start  the 
endgame,  so let's check our provisions.  You should have nothing 
but  the LAMP,  LUTE,  GUM,  CAGE,  CHAMPAGNE  BOTTLE,  DIE,  and 
ANTICUBE. 

Back  to the cave by going SOUTH three times,  WEST three  times, 
then SOUTHEAST,  SOUTH,  and WEST.  The notice at the bank should 
now say "Closed due to not quite enough business." Well,  you can 
solve  that.  There's one last treasure you haven't noticed  yet. 
EXAMINE LUTE and you'll find a silver plectrum on it.  OPEN  SAFE 
then PUT PLECTRUM IN SAFE and CLOSE SAFE.  Now WAIT one turn  and 
the  little  man should come out and change the  notice  to  read 
"Bank open all hours, please enter."

There are a few preparations you have to make before you're ready 
to tackle the bank.  First GET CARD FROM POCKET then PUT DIE  AND 
ANTICUBE IN POCKET. Now, we're gong to teach the bird a new word. 
Say MYNAH, HOORAY. You may have to repeat it before the bird says 
it. Now CHEW GUM and you're ready to enter the bank.

OPEN  DOOR  THEN  SOUTH and you will find  a  couple  of  queues. 
Experienced adventurers will have learned long ago not to try  to 
get  in  the  short line,  so ENTER FURTHER QUEUE  and  you  will 
immediately  be at the teller's window.  SHOW CARD TO TELLER  and 
you will be whisked into the Bank Manager's office. He will begin 
explaining  to  you  that  he can't let  you  have  any  of  your 
valuables,  because the bank would be out of business. The timing 
is pretty critical here so pay attention.  As soon as you are  in 
his office DROP CAGE AND BOTTLE.  Then WAIT one turn,  then SHAKE 
BOTTLE. At this point he should escort you out of the office. You 
may have to WAIT a turn after shaking the bottle,  but as soon as 
your are outside his office and he has locked thedoor behind him, 
PUT  GUM IN KEYHOLE.  It is important that you do this while  the 
Bank Manager is outside his office, so that he can't get back in. 
If  you've done everything right,  you should hear the Mynah  say 
"hooray" and there will be an explosion.  Everyone will panic and 
leave  you alone in the bank.  You will notice that the roof  has 
been blown off; this is your big chance.

It's  time for music so PLAY LUTE AND SING URFANORE  PENDRA.  You 
will  be floating in the air having dropped everything  you  were 
carrying.  Now go SOUTH and when you land you will be in the Bank 
Manager's office, and about to begin a very clever and perplexing 
puzzle. 

Go EAST into the bank vault.  You will notice three exits besides 
the  one  you  came  in.  Remember that I  said  dice  were  very 
important in this game?  Well,  the exits in the rooms from  here 
on,  are equivalent to spots on a die.  You must roll a number on 
the  die that does NOT contain a spot correspondingto one of  the 
exits in the room you are in. In other words, you must use anexit 
that does NOT appear on the die after you roll it.  (You may have 
to  read that several times to catch on to what I mean.) To  make 
it more complicated,  each time you use an exit,  the number  you 
rolled will disappear from the die.  You must make your moves  so 
that  when you reach the final room (which is ALWAYS  reached  by 
rolling  a  FOUR) ALL the numbers will have disappeared  off  the 
die. It stands to reason that as you get closer to your goal it's 
going to take longer to get a number...rolling the final four may 
take 30 or more rolls! Luckily, you rubbed the horseshoe and have 
Lady Luck on your side to make things easier.

Okay,  here we go.  The room you're in has three exits.  ROLL DIE 
and  ask for a TWO.  Then go DOWN (See,  the center exit was  not 
represented  on the die).  Now the room you are in will have  the 
same  number of exits,  in the same position,  as the number  you 
previously rolled,  in this case there will be two exits,  NW and 
SE.  This time ROLL DIE and ask for a ONE. Go NORTHWEST. Now ROLL 
DIE  and ask for SIX and go DOWN.  Now roll a FIVE and  go  WEST. 
Nowroll a FOUR and go DOWN.
 
Aha!  Here are all the treasures you deposited! But wait! There's 
more!  EXAMINE  THE PILLAR and you will discover that there is  a 
weighing  machine  on  it with a cube which appears  to  be  VERY 
valuable.  The weighing machine isdelicately balanced so that  if 
you  disturb the weight,  you will die.  If you EXAMINE CUBE  you 
will see that it is about the same size as the one in your pocket.
