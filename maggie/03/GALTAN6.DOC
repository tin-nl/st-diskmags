                          REVIEWED BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

Jeah,  finally  the Dutch are getting busy in the  demo  section. 
First  there  were  the to Aenigmatica demos  and  here's  a  new 
quality product from Holland.  This demo is for my taste probably 
the best demo that has been released this month.  I think that we 
never ever had that many demo releases in one summer, but this is 
probably all due to the Gen 4 competition in France. 

Anyway,  I'd better get straight down to the review as there  are 
quite a few newish things in this demo,  well,  non of the things 
are actually new,  but everything is just pretty nicely done. The 
only  thing that has not been done before in the demo section  is 
that  you  have some kind of a horizontal shoot-em-up game  as  a 
main  menu.  This here is not really a shoot-em-up as  you  can't 
shoot  anybody,  the only thing that you can do is fly about  and 
land in different garages where you then can enter the  according 
screen.  As I am already telling you about the main menu I  might 
as well finish that and tell you about the loader afterwards.  At 
the bottom of the menu there is a Galtan log wobbling/i.e. moving 
from the right to the left etc... On top of that there is the all 
so boring scroller which is present in every demo.  The animation 
for  ship is also very nice,  the ship can be  controlled  either 
with the joystick or the arrow keys next to the numerical key pad 
(as  if there are any others).   The landscape on which  you  are 
flying I think is also very nicely drawn (they must have a pretty 
good  graffix man over there),  I especially like the craters  he 
has done.  As there is not much other movement on the screen, the 
group  has decided to have some more little things moving on  the 
screen like,  it's very hard to describe these things,  they look 
like  these little towers from Xenon I that shoot at you  (  that 
doesn't say much but is has to do).

As  I  have started with the main menu I'd better do  the  loader 
now. The loader contains the one thing that was never done in any 
of the Lost Boys demos,  yes,  well, done, it has something to do 
with  the borders.   This intro features full overscan with  some 
text  on the screen wobbling or should I rather say  moving  from 
the  left to the right ?  Well you get the idea ( I howep so  for 
your  sake).  There  is  a nice piece of graffix  in  the  bottom 
border,  I  presume (as I can't remember) that it says  something 
like Galtan 6. 

Just a little interruption here, didn't you ever wonder about the 
word GRAPHICS.  Years ago somebody started to spell the word like 
this  Graphix,  but don't you think that this is only half of  an 
improvement  ?  I  always say that if one  changes  something  it 
should  be  done fully.  The fully changed  version  would  sound 
something like that: GRAFFIX. I hope that everybody will be using 
this here from now on.
End of the interruption.

Anyway, there is also anothing thing/text displayer active on the 
intro screen.  The text displayer has been used before,  it  just 
prints up one letter after the other....


The 1st Screen:  OH THAT
There is a sign saying Galtan 6 in the background, on top of that 
there are as many scrollers as can be fitted on top of each other 
(all  in  one plane).  On top of these scrolls there  is  another 
layer  of  scrollers  (this time they are  not  one  plane).  And 
finally  on  top  of these scrolls there are 4  very  nice  32x32 
sprites. 


The 2n Screen: FULL SCOLL
At the top of the screen there is a CIA logo moving from the left 
to  the right and this little routine repeats itself forever  and 
ever. The whole background is moving about in all directions. The 
background looks like it is 2 layers. And in between these layers 
there is a scroller (which in itself has some colourbars). 


The 3rd Screen: MEGADETH
There  is no left/right bottom border.  As so often done  before, 
the scrolline has been placeed into this border. There is nothing 
much else happening in the screen.  To explain the rest I  should 
give you some more background information. There is a Heavy Metal 
band which always produces some great album covers,  as you  have 
probably gathered the band is called MEGADETH.  Anyway,  the have 
produced  an  album called PIECE IS SELLING BUT  WHO  IS  BUYING. 
Galtan  6 have used this album cover and then have  animated  it, 
now,  the skeleton waves his skinny hand and moves his jaw about. 
The animation for this is quite nice. 


The 4th Screen: BIG SIX
The  background is moving about with one scroll at the bottom  of 
the screen.  A CIA logo with colour bars appears on the right and 
moves  on  to  the  left  of  the  screen  where  it  then  again 
disappears.  The scroll at the bottom then disappears and instead 
of the scroll there are three big one plane sprites saying 6.  As 
there  is a piece of graffix at the top of the screen which  says 
Galtan (this piece wobbles about) and therefore the whole name is 
on the screen.There is another scroller which has appeared by now 
at the top and another one on the middle of the screen which does 
not  move  across the screen in a  straight line,  it  follows  a 
sinus curve (not to forget that the scroll has some colour bars).


The 5th Screen: BIG LOGO
There is a very big Galtan 6 logo moving up and down the  screen, 
beneath it there is a biggish scroll.  There are also some colour 
bars in the background amd there are also three sprites  floating 
around saying CIA. 


The Last Screen: THE RESET
If  you finally hit the reset button of your ST (which  you  will 
probably  only  do  after three hours  of  watching  this  demo). 
Anyway,  there is a very very big Galtan 6 log which is very well 
drawn.  Now, in addition to that there is some blocky text saying 
Galtan 6 which is moving across all the borders.  This method (of 
cheating  the borders) was first done on one of the intros  coded 
by  TEX  and  was then quickly adapted by  many  other  crews.  I 
personally that it looks very nice but is not very clever. 


This  here is it again with this review,  the only thing  that  I 
would like to say about this demo is that I think that these guys 
have just shown that they can compete with the bigger guys by not 
introducing  anything new but reproducing all the old  things.  i 
thought  that the main menu was really nice but could  have  been 
done a lot better if there would have been some more movement !!

As this here is probably the longest demo review in this issue  I 
will better get to an end, here's my summary:
