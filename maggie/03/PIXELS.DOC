                           THE PIXEL TWINS

  Who or what are the Pixel Twins? Before we give you the gory 
details, we must first take a trip back through the mists of time to 
the days of the ZX Spectrum. Our heroes were a small group of computer 
nuts who frequented the Wandsworth Computer Club (no longer running) 
and all had a weird sence of humour. They used to swap their 
slideshows with the other members and wrote the odd game or two. One 
of their last projects was a joke teletext called Bumfax which did the 
rounds and even reached as far as Brighton! But enough of that, the ST 
appeared and the STB's as they were then known decided that this was a 
mean computer to own. Mug UK as he is now known was the first to get 
one closely followed by Nod, who got his for the price of three C64 
pictures from a local computer shop. Next came PCM who tried the same 
stunt but didn't quite get away with it. Within half a year Milli 
Pixel had also become the proud owner of an ST (at a disgustingly 
cheap price from an Atari show). After a series of cross words and 
death threats, Mug UK went his own way and was last heard of as living 
in Wales and working at a club called The Blue Oyster. This left Ed 
who has still to get his ST, but does the odd doodle on everybody 
elses. He's also got a load of listings to type in when he does get 
his ST.
  Where did the name come from? One day when Nod and Milli were stuck 
in traffic on the way back from Stoke, they were discussing the name 
of the STB's and how it didn't sound jolly enough, it was in this same 
traffic jam that Milli came up with the idea of The Pixel Twins. He 
then went on to the idea of T-shirts, posters, chocolate bars, etc., 
etc., until Nod had to hit him about the face and neck with a rubber 
hose in order for him to calm down.
  That was the story, here are the facts with the three newest 
members first.
