

                            Yo, boys!


Here's DOGUE DE MAUVE, at the second OVR convention (or the "BEACH 
PARTY"), organized from the 19/08/90 to the 29/08/90. We're now 
11.12 PM, the 24/08/90 (the convention started five days ago but 
we needed all STs for various purposes -coding, graphix, demo 
watching...-).

We'll let this ST on, so that everybody will be able to write 
anything about the convention (just like the ICC convention 
article in MAGGIE 2.0).
We are, at the moment, 12 OVERLANDERS, 4 PENDRAGONS and 4 guests 
(LUDUG, GUDUL, XRAY & CAPTAIN BUG). Some other guys should 
arrive tomorrow morning...

As I am typing this, most of us are watching... this screen! No, 
they're watching ALIENS (by James CAMERON). A great film, actually!
I'm trying to be discreet 'coz I don't want to disturb the guys 
in front of TV (some others aren't that polite and cannot help 
talking...).
Well, what else can I say? Ripley has just found Newt in his 
underground room and now Gorman tries to get some informations 
from her... In vain! Good luck that Ripley is a better 
psychologist.

OK. You probably know the whole movie, I won't try to tell you 
everything that happens behind me...

Well, I'm tired now and I think I'm gonna stop typing and watch 
the end of "ALIENS".

WARNING: this text will surely content some language and 
punctuation that may hurt english purists and other typists.
Even if I'm supposed to be the OVR "english expert", I won't try 
to correct all the following stuff which will probably be over 
50Kb (unpacked). (Note from FURYO: "DOGUE, lazy boy!").
So, please forgive us and have fun trying to read the froggy 
"supposed-to-look-like-english" language...

OK, for the following writers, here's a example of the top line 
they should use before typing their funny messages.

--------------- SOMEONE from NAME OF GROUPE --------- 00.00 A.M

                         ... MESSAGE ...


---------------- HUMUNGUS from OVERLANDERS ------------ 1.10 A.M

I suppose you all have some friend who can't avoid talking during
films. I've one of this kind. We have just seen ALIENS (the 
second part). At the beginnig I and GUDUL have tested other guys 
sense of smell : we have put our stinky shoes just under the 
chair of FURYO and NEMROD but they didn't smell anything. Hum,
I think we will continue this experience this night during their
sleep.


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 1.35 A.M

Yeah! Now, we have just seen ALIENS, and after an hard labour, 
I'd tried to find an ST free... HUMUNGUS, ADSO and STAN are 
speaking about movies. On my right side, GUDUL tried desesperatly 
to debug a program. TERENCE, NEMROD, and LUDUG are looking some 
porno-show on the amiga (nasty boys!). PIB tells some really bad 
joke about the women's sex. Now, some people will soon see a 
JAMES BOND: THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS (with MARYAM D'ABO, slurp!!!).
OK, I will stop ,coz I want to see this film, bye for now. 


---------------- TERENCE from PENDRAGONS ------------ 1.55 A.M

Hi ev'rybody ! I was just passing by when I saw that Furyo dares
to say I've been watching an X-show on the wrong machine !! It's
totally false !!!! I was not watching this slide show ( how could
you think I was making this kinda thing ???) I 've just been 
converting all the pictures on the ST in order to please NEMROD !
I've got nothing to do with watching X-show on Amiga !! I do it 
on ST , that's really more moral.
I will resume the look around FURYO was doing. ZIGGY (the little
yellow duck) is now debugging his full-o-boot routine to make it 
work on our good Amiga-killer (arf arf arf !), the STE, with 
CAPTAIN BUG aside him. DIM is working on something I can't see 
from here. YYYYEEEEAAAAHHHH !!! GUDUL just make our Spectrum show
rout get back to the GEM with no error. I was too lazy to make 
this work even if I made the Spectrum routine.
In front of the TV set FURYO, ADSO, CRYSTAR, SILVER, HUMUNGUS, 
DOGUE DE MAUVE and STAN are watching the film FURYO talked about 
before even if only the music worth something. X-RAY is now 
making his ten minutes of coding. Be couragous boy there's only 
four minutes left. No that's a pity, X-RAY wasn't able to resist,
he's now watching the film...
I'll leave you here 'coz GUDUL found another bug in our 168-lines 
spectrum rout !! We will soon beat TCB that's sure !!!
                                              TERENCE at 2.31 A.M


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 2.50 A.M

Here I am going again, the film is so bad (even if the main 
actress is so wonderful) that I can't resist: I stop before the 
end. This film is pure shit, at the beginning, JAMES BOND runs 
faster than a jeep, maybe for a comic film, it would be good, but 
here, it's really incredible. And I don't tell you the "gadgets" 
that JAMES BOND use (totally incredible, once again!).
ZIGGY is now making the main-menu for the EUROPEAN DEMOS, but 
there is still some (horrible) bugs.  
Now, I will tell you the strange morning that we have had two 
days ago... After some longs (but friendly) fights with the 
PENDRAGONS (it has been impossible to sleep this night...), we 
have decided to throw SILVER in a basin (surely the best way for 
being up quickly!). After a short discussion, we have decided 
to throw every people in the basin... At the beginning, it has 
been really cool: we only wet their buttocks, but, at the end, the 
poor guys (like DIM) have been really really moisten...
It is now 3.23 AM, and the others are still watching that third-
rate film of JAMES BOND, I don't understand how they can manage 
to watch such a stupid film.


----------- NEMROD from THE PENDRAGONS ----------- at 3h38 A.M

Hello!!! First at all I want to refute TERENCE'S talks. I don't 
look at the porno-show (note from FURYO: NEMROD is a liar, 
don't believe him!) shut up Fuckurio!!! I said I didn't look at
the porno-show, I was making (note from TERENCE that's false, all 
is false even if it is not yet written!!!) it!!! Shit de Shit, they
are very inflating aren't they??? I 'll come back soon
(note from FURYO: the latest will be the best!!!) when FURYO and 
TERENCE will sleep!!! Bye and speak you soon!!!


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 3.56 A.M   

Just few words: if one day, you have nothing to do, just look at 
a JAMES BOND film (at least, the last ones), and count the 
amazing number of incredibly things (averagely one per 10 
minutes...) there are in those sort of movies.


---------------- GUDUL from GUDUL CORPORATION-------- 4.03 A.M

Ok here I am! TERENCE explained me the soundtrack theory but I 
don't know if he was really serious 'coz 5 minutes before he was 
glaring at the porno show ... The others were watching T.V. (it 
was a porno film from JAMES BOND called 'more a whole in your 
body' or something like that... hum a little message for DOGUE DE 
MAUVE (the man who has coded the mega screen called "SCROLLUS"
which beats the "CRAZY DIGI" demo) : please read all my text and 
correct the errors and you can indicate the number here : '10'
Now I'm sure that the text is in 'approximatively' correct 
english. Hum, I mean : the text is in 'DOGUE's english'.
baaahouaaa ... hum it's time to sleep guys or perhaps to wake up 
for others members of OVR coz I think when ADSO go to bed every
people 50 meters around can't sleep... FURYO and NEMROD are 
playing TETRIS but they can't do better than me : my best score is 
under 100 points whereas humungus do 1000 points.
I'm going to finish my last COKE for this night and after that 
I'm going to sleep coz I'm fed up with the soundtracker muzaxx
wich are on every screen and every screens are tuned in the 
maximum volume. Wait wait... LUDUG has just completed the porno 
show convertion from amiga and he works on ST. Wahouuu.
Ok that's all for a day guys.  BYE!

                    **** *  * ***  *  * *

NFDDM: OK, I said I wouldn't correct this text 'coz it would be 
an incredibly hard work. But, as Gudul asked me to have a look at 
his writing and is a friend, I did correct it. I found 10 real 
mistakes and tried to make the text a bit more clearer.


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 4.40 A.M

Wow GUDUL, stop to say nonsense about my score at TETRIS, 
my best score is: 1622 points, not that bad, hey?


---------------- XRAY from BANANA CLUB ------------- 4.57 A.M

Coucou !!!   I introduce myself : I'm XRAY from Bananas Club 
little coder, yes, little because I learn... So my first 
production will be included in the charaponta demo, the first demo 
of Bananas club. We choose the name charaponta at our demo 
because all the members live at "Pontcharra". So all the people 
of pontcharra are called "Charrapontains", so (again!) the demo 
must be called "Charrapontains demo" so (again!!) we must release 
a logo "Charrapontains" for the main menu ... But! madman had 
not enough place on his main menu to draw all the letters of 
the logo then he scratches the 3 last letters ... We decide to
let it like that so (...) the demo is the "Charraponta demo".
Ok boys I stop to bore you with our bad demo.
Hey I forgot to tell you the truth of the stories of the porno 
shown : At about 2.00 a.m the PENDRAGONS decided to ripped off 
some pics from amiga, the first show they took is called :
"bordelo disk nø10" (the name is a provocation!). On that disk 
you can find some nice photos of girls and sometimes without any 
clothes (sometimes? all the times! ...). After that the Pendragons
said they have not turn back any porno pics !!!
Ok boys this is all the sun is just in the upper of the window so
good night or good morning !!! I speak a bad english but that is 
not my fault !!! that's the fault of the guys who give me some 
cards while a english lesson ...


---------------- TERENCE from ONCE AGAIN  ------------ 6.49 A.M

Hi ! I'm fed up with debugging my multibob fullscreen so I 'm 
gonna tell you what is happening now : 
 NEMROD just said "LE COOONNN !!!" coz he's just lost in his 
STUNT CAR game. I must reveal that he's a real looser in this 
game. I really wonder why he keeps on playing (should I say 
loosing ??). Now , only three guys are not sleeping :
NEMROD who is still playing the same game , DIM who is making his 
mega-fullscreen scroll bounce up and down and I typing because 
I'm too lazy to debug my screen. What do you think of an unlimited-
bobs screen with soundtrack and fullscreen on ST (and maybe others 
things if it works fine soon) ? 
DIM told me an uncredible thing : he manage to play Leaving 
Teramis until the last level but the copy he was having just 
crash . So, he was quite please to watch a trainer version of 
this game. To install the trainer just type ZHO IS THE BEST  
shift+ø .
This is the code on an AZERTY keyboard (french one). Hope you 
will manage to convert it on the QWERTY shitty keyboard.
NEMROD is once again trying to convert AMIGA pictures. But this 
time it ain't X-pictures. It's a wonderful slide show .And 
NEMROD wants me to display those 512 colors pictures in 
fullscreen !
NEMROD is a so good AMIGA user that he's just crashed the picture 
he was trying to convert. 'Only AMIGA makes it possible !'.
I found the error : the NOP integrator was not integrating very 
well the lsl and lsr instructions. I will know debug the 
integrator in order to debug my screen. Pretty no ??
 
                                               Terence , 7.14 A.M


---------------- NEMROD from NEVER SLEEP ---------- at 8.42 A.M
Waaaouuuhhhh!!!! Once again a sleepless (white) night!!!!! 
Aaaaaaahhhh...
Where is the keyboard??? Aaahhhhh FURYO sleeps at last!!!
I can tell you the truth about him: his feet stink a lot!!!
So now I can breathe!!! TERENCE (the little dwarf) is going to 
the W.C. So I can be delirious about him... Shit he's coming 
back!!! At any rate, only DIM, TERENCE and ME are still living, 
coz sleeping is like being dead... All the others are spineless
and fly specks... We can say together: we are the best (it's 
true).
Bye, I am about to have breakfast, write you next...

                          Nemrod, 9,00 A.M


----------- DOGUE DE MAUVE from OVERLANDERS ------------ 11.35 A.M

YOOOO! Here I go again... I just woke up, washed me and read the 
(crap) texts from the others... They're bad at english, actually!
I couldn't help correcting a few things but you've already 
probably found that it's not mistakes-free (even my part, I 
guess, 'coz I'm supposed to be good at english but I'm not that 
good in fact).
Three guys arrived this morning (and woke me up!): TYPHON & 
SPEEDLIGHT from OVERLANDERS and MAD MAN from BANANAS CLUB.
Like all other new incomers, they will have to do the washing up 
and to cook our meal. That's the rule here!
Anyway, TYPHON has made a very nice ASM screen and SPEEDLIGHT 
designed some actually nice graphix (as far as I could see, 'coz 
I didn't wear my glasses when he showed them to STAN).
STAN is sitting near me, talking about JAMES BOND's little 
brother and it reminded me what FURYO said about JAMES BOND 
("THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS"). You've to know that FURYO likes only 
realistic films (even if "MIDNIGHT EXPRESS" isn't that 
realistic...). Well, I think that the JAMES BOND films have a 
very special spirit. Of course, they aren't very realistic 
(especially when James & Kara jump from a plane in a jeep) but
that doesn't matter in this kind of film (could you imagine James 
BOND jumping from a plane and crashing on the ground in a bloody 
mess?).
Allright, I was just informed that it was my turn to cook (it's 
now 1.00 PM 'coz SPEEDLIGHT, TYPHON & MAD MAN showed me some 
stuff since I wrote about James BOND. I'll leave the keyboard to 
the next guy... "See" you later...

---------------- GUDUL from HIS BED ------------ 1.15 P.M

There is something that I couldn't understand. A guy has written 
his name at the beginning of this article and at first he isn't 
in this convention and he hasn't write any message. Hum, I'm sure 
that it is X-RAY 'coz he has broken his watch and he don't know 
that between 11.35 A.M and 1.15 P.M it can be 00.00 A.M in the 
same day.
Now it's time to wake up the other member of this convention coz 
we are going to eat and I'm hungry...

---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 1.22 P.M

Yeah! I'm just being up, and I read the article by DOGUE which 
spoke about MIDNIGHT EXPRESS and JAMES BOND, and I just want to 
say that if MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is not that realistic, THE JAMES 
BOND are some thermo-nuclear-futuristic-psychedelic-
pathetic-and-lotsa-much-more-things movies...


------------ ADSO and STAN from OVERLANDERS ------- 2.00 P.M

Hello everybody! Now we are eating. I am seeing CRYSTAR eating
his 'Yaourt' boiled and roten by the dust of the room. BERK, my
name isn't BERK but CRYSTAR is a big PIG. We would like to 
explain how was this convention but Stanus Mercurya prefered
to walk in the montain (Yes we are in the ALPES, beautiful land, 
where the sun is always shining (like in the movie!)).
     This Beach Party is a real success because two days ago
Furyo declared the war to the PENDRAGONS in puting them in a big
washtub full of ice water !!! But the PENDRAGONS wanted a 
revenge... Ziggy Stardust, Humungus and Stan were quietly 
sleeping at this moment... Everybody had dived in this washtub 
except them. So, the PENDRAGONS shamly wake them and threw
them in the water !!! A big battle began...
Ziggy and the others hide in the loft and threw by the window all
our clothes... They locked the door and we couldn't go in the 
new HQ of the irreductible Galics. After 5 minutes we found a 
skeleton key and as the Galics didn't have any more MAGIC POTION
and as we were more than them, we won the fight. The revenge was 
terrifying and all of them were killed in the washtub...
So if you wanna make big battles, just come to the OVERLANDERS 
conventions. Yeeahhhhhh.
                               We love you...

                                             PM--> 14:40.

---------------- CRYSTAR from PENDRAGONS ------------ 15.25 A.M

   Hello! Hello everybody! It is my first message. I just have read 
the other articles and I think that we have too much discuss 
about the film of 007. This convention is really great for the 
moment even if we must cook and do the washing up but it is quite 
normal in this kind of meeting. 
For the moment, a lot of guys are watching C64 wonderful demos. 
and almost all the others are coding. 
In fact just before writting this message I was trying to 
optimize a 3D rout but I need a listing and there is no printer 
so I had to rewrite myself the interesting part of my source.
I would like to say that I have seen some very great stuff from 
OVERLANDERS there. The fullscreen of ADSO is really great and you 
will discovered it in the EUROPEAN DEMOS, and the 3D rout from 
ZIGGY STARDUST is really great too (the best I have seen on the 
ATARI ST).
Ok, I think this is all for this message so, bye !!!


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 3.41 P.M

HUMUNGUS and ADSO are sitting beside me, and they tried to 
include the new data waves that HUMUNGUS has made for the 
sprite of the fullscreen of ADSO. But the matter is that they 
don't manage to include the new ones, and there's still an 
enormous bug...  It is now 3.56 P.M and the bugs aren't yet 
corrected.
YO!!! the bug is almost corrected; in fact, it is becoz of that 
shitty STE which doesn't like the screen of ADSO.

Note from ADSO: Now it works on every ST existing in the world!

----------------- CAPTAIN BUG from BANANA CLUB ---------4.20 PM

HELLO.The member of banana club the most cool club (I think)
and a very very little crew (3 personns). Xray besides me and
need some help because his logo routine doesn't work. He has made 
the most trash coder I've ever seen. On my right there is PIB
he's the god himself because the old C64 was totaly destroyed
and after 5 minutes it worked (it is magic!!!).
Good I'll help Xray because he says words who are not very good.
Yes, good and have a nice day!!! (TYPHON says me I played too
many times Midi Maze (I'm not sure but doguy confirmed)).
Yes yes yo euuuhh (Beasties Boys is good for you!! and banana 
too).I was very happy to tell to you and see you a next time.

------------ TYPHON from OVERLANDERS --------------------4.41 PM

HELLO !!!! Here's the first message from me !!! It is not because
I am a lazy guy, but because I come to the 2nd ovr convention 
seven days after the begining of it, we arrived at 9.15 AM at
the station and we begin to wait Stan-man who was supposed to
catch us (me, madman and speedlight) with his Stan-mobil, but
half an hours after, he was not arrived, then we decided to 
go to the party in taxi (Shit! at 9.15 PM there was a pretty nice
taxi-girl ( oouuaaaaa !! ) and we took at 9.45 AM a taxi with
a (beurk!) ugly old woman). When we arrived at the party, we 
saw that everybody were sleeping ( BZZZZ ) exepted Terence, Dim
and Nemrod, that silly stan was sleeping!! , then we decided to
awake him for this missing, he was very surprised when we shouted
to him "STAN YA TYPH MADMAN ET SPEED A ALLER CHERCHER A LA GARE"
and he (shame on him) put his head in the sleeping bag !!!.
Hey stan your are not a serious guy, if you must go to the 
station to catch us at 9.15 AM don't go to bed at 5 AM !!!!
         C.U. SOON !                                                

------------- SPEEDLIGHT FROM OVERLANDERS ----------------- 17.05 PM

Hello this is Speedlight from the Overlanders, right now 
writting his part of letter at the big convention that the 
Overlanders have organized... Well I think the other writters of 
this letter have talked enough of this convention before, so I 
won't be long on this subject... I would like to speak about my 
new graphixx, because I prefer that you discover themselves in 
the soon_to_come european demo (in the Typhon'n'Speedlight's 
Rapidomax demo )... I've also made new fonts that you will see 
later in one of our products... There is quite few st's here,so 
I had to be quick to write this text,then I could use this st to 
finish the Rapidomax demo... Typhon has quite a hard work to do 
before he'll be able to say : "yeah,finish!"......So as well as I 
said it before I'll leave you to make a 'free-keyboard',so that 
Typhon will be able to code.......but don't worry,you'll only had 
to read the scrolltext in the 'Rapidomax demo' in the european-
demo to read some text by speedlight...... well,bye bye,and see 
you soon (if you will have the courage to read 
text.......)......bye bye and be cool....

-------------- STAN MERCURY OF THE OVERLANDERS -------- 22.03 PM

     Yeho! This is horrible !!! yes, yes this horrible because 
Mister TYPHON alias the " SUCKER-HEAD" write some really bad 
craptalks about my humble personn. Actually I see a great first 
screen coded by him in ASM (fullscreen) but the brain of TYPHON 
is really shit brothel (this is a message by Doctor Stan the 
Man). Adso and Mad Man (of the Banana !) playing to "SUPER 
SPRINT", Doguy and Speedy speaking together. 

     Ok, I thinks that The Pendragons is a really great crew and 
the members are really nice.
     
          to be continued....


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 2.09 A.M

OK, we have just seen a new film: "LE PIEGE DE CRISTAL" (sorry 
for the foreigners, but I don't know the original title of this 
movie). It was a really great film, with a very good actor: BRUCE
WILLIS (he played in a nice serie: CLAIR DE LUNE (MOONLIGHTING)).
So, I will now seing the new stuffs by the PENDRAGONS, and ADSO.
BBBYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!

---------------- PIB from OVERLANDERS -------------- 2.20 A.M

    Hey FURYO the french name of "PIEGE DE CRISTAL" is
"DIE HARD" and the english name of the serie "CLAIR DE LUNE"
is "BLUE MOON" I know it's not a good traduction but it's not
my job !! OK now I look tired and I want to play TWINTRIS on 
AMIGA to beat the score of FURYO (it's 1622) don't laught it's
too hard to beat him , now I will leave of the ATARI ST keyboard
of STAN MERCURY so BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE BYE !!!
   
            See you soon on this lovely TEXT !!

------------- DOGUE DE MAUVE from OVERLANDERS ----------- 2.78 ZM

Hey, PIB, I think that real title of "CLAIR DE LUNE" is 
"MOON LIGHTING" (with Bruce Willis), not "BLUE MOON". Well, I 
forgive you, anyway, and I'm sure you're going to beat FURYO on 
TWINTRIS (very nice game!!!).

-------------------  XRAY from dodo  --------------- 3.20 A.M

Whooooaaaaaa everybody ! This is XRAY a very sleepy XRAY ! I've 
just to finish to ripp from amiga 3 disks of nice modules. A very 
baddly hard work... What a bad luck ZIGGY; HUMUNGUS scratch you

     Youhou !!!! this is the return of the stars : (eh eh eh). 
So, we would like to introduce the new label of the gathering
of two french crews. We would like to explain you the reason of 
the creation of this new label :

     First of all, these two groups were in the "FRENCH ALLIANCE" 
but they were the only ones which really worked and evolved their 
routs. We took experience of this corporation and now here it 
is...          T R I T O N -  D E V E L O P M E N T.

The two groups belonging to this label are:  THE OVERLANDERS
                                                   AND
                                              THE PENDRAGONS.

     Ok, we hope to produce some really nice and new demos and in
that way prove that Frenchies are not that bad.

     The first production is "THE EUROPEAN DEMOS" which includes 
most of the crews of Europe, and obviously us and Pendragons (the 
return).

     Surely this new label will increase during the years coming.

                              To be continued...
