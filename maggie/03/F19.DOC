             F19 - a hands-on Guide to Stealthy living 'n Stuff
            ====================================================

By Me!!! CIH of course!!!!

This game is a biggie,  I mean absolutely huge!!  As in an  Omigod 
my trousers can't contain it sort of size..  As this is nothing to 
do  with  'Diary  of a Baby part II' I am referring  to  the  long 
awaited  ST version of F19 Stealth Fighter which has been with  us 
(Commodore  64)  since 1987 and only just  converted  to  superior 
68000  based  computers by the UK division of  Microprose..Was  it 
worth  the  wait??  I  hear  you cry,  the answer,  happily  is  a 
resounding  YES!  for reasons I will go into more detail over in a 
minute...

Firstly,  it  comes  in an impressively large box and weighs  like 
there is a small gold brick inside,  this initial contact with the 
package leaves you feeling somewhat happier about the 30 notes you 
have given to the nice computer shop man for it (You HAVE paid for 
it haven't you???). when you get it home, you eagerly pull off the 
tightly wrapped clingfilm to open the box and find inside 3  disks 
labelled  'A,  'B,  and  'C,  a  keyboard overlay,  an ST and Amiga 
technical supplement, maps of the four theatres of war, Libya, The 
Persian Gulf,  The North Cape (Northern Scandinavia,  N.  Russia,) 
and  good  ol' Central Europe,  guarantee card and last but by  no 
means least, the 192 page manual....

The manual is recommended reading before booting disk 'A, well you 
probably could dive straight in but make a total balls-up and  end 
up fumbling panic-stricken through the manual anyway....The manual 
is far superior to anything else, overtaking FALCON'S good manual, 
and leaving trailing hopelessly F29 RETALIATOR'S booklet!  It goes 
into detail on the plane layout, and guides you through a detailed 
mission tutorial.  It also gives lovingly detailed descriptions on 
air-combat and stealth flying techniques,  bombing techniques etc. 
We also get highly detailed descriptions of the countries involved 
and  their weapons systems and aircraft in use,  and their  likely 
effectiveness  (or not...) against your Stealth fighter.  In short 
it is an excellent read,, but before you say "So what, thirty quid 
is a bit much for a book.." what about the program itself?

Well  disk  'A autoboots and you get a control options  screen,  I 
would advise selection of 'joystick personally speaking. Once this 
is  done,  you  get  a  nice title screen and  a  shortish  sample 
playing,  and  then the Roster screen (known on Falcon as  'Sierra 
Hotel..) from where you enter your pilot details and then into the 
mission briefing screen...

For  the purpose of your first training mission,  you are off  the 
Libyan coast,  facing a conventional war scenario, and detailed to 
attack  a  SAM  radar near Tripoli,  and also to attack  a  nearby 
missileboat  as  a secondary target,  your 'rules  of  engagement' 
permit  the  destruction of any other targets  of  military  value 
(IE.anything  that gets in your way,  subject to how much weaponry 
you  can carry...) You can find out from the briefing  screen  you 
can  find  out details of enemy radar  locations,  SAM  batteries, 
likely problem areas etc,  which you can fix into your mind before 
taking  off.  You  then proceed to choose which plane,  either the 
'Fictional' F19. or the real-life F117 Stealth fighter and then to 
choose armaments..

Your aircraft is already loaded by your crew chief, in this case a 
mixture   of  HARM  antiradar  missiles,   MAVERICK  air-to-ground 
missiles,  and AMRAAM medium range with SIDEWINDER short-rage air-
to-air missiles.  You also have a 20mm internal cannon.  As all of 
the above are extremely useful you leave it as it is and start the 
mission....  NB. a point to note on weapons is that they are quite 
often not restricted to one type of target, and can be categorised 
by  varying  degrees  of effectiveness  in  differing  roles,  for 
example,  MAVERICKS  being better than freefall bombs in precision 
attack...

For the purposes of this mission you are launched from the deck of 
the  USS America at nightime (OOeer!) and you follow  the  pre-set 
waypoints  programmed  into your automatic pilot  (which  you  can 
use).  This  is more straightforward then it sounds..  So you take 
off lift the nose slightly, don't forget to raise the landing-gear 
and the flaps, keep the height below 500ft and off you go...

For  this first phase of the mission it is a good idea  to  select 
AMRAAM's  for  any  air-to-air nastiness,  keeping an eye  on  the 
central  EMV  (electromagnetic visibility scale)  which  shows  an 
ever-present   'blur   from  ground-based   radars..   Life   gets 
interesting  when a fighter plane starts to 'paint  your  aircraft 
with its radar and it is usually a good idea to 'pot' it with your 
AMRAAM's  before it gets too close...  HA HA,  eat seawater Libyan 
Scumbag!!! About this time a Libyan patrol boat takes an unhealthy 
interest  in  your  activities and  lobs  an  SA12  Surface-to-air 
missile  at you,  discretion and really violent manouvrering being 
the better part of valour here... Fortunately for this part of the 
simulation the missile does not bend your aircraft in two as it is 
still a 'training mission' remember??

You then approach the coast,  lock on to the big whirly thing that 
is the Tripoli main SAM radar and fire your HARM. You get a lovely 
gush of flame,  if it is hit,  on your forward tracking camera.... 
You  then go on to your secondary target,  a Missile boat,  and go 
for  this with a Maverick,  again it's demise can be witnessed  on 
you  forward-looking  tracking camera...  It is worth noting  that 
most of the action takes place at a distance,  it is usually not a 
good idea to get a 'look' at your target as it has a  distressing 
tendency to shoot at you furiously....

You  then  lay  in  a course for Sicily  and  a  friendly  airbase 
(surrounded  by people doing 'Godfather' impressions..) where  you 
are  given  several more static screens in the mould  of  'Falcon' 
depicting your successful completion of the mission.

A few points to note....  the sensitivity of the aircraft controls 
is  very  well  done,  you can turn reasonably  gently  with  firm 
consistent pressure on the joystick without oversteering wildly as 
happens  in  certain  other  flight-sims,  but  if  required,  for 
emergency 'panic use,  you can wrench the aircraft around with the 
best of them. Also the graphics are perfectly proportional to your 
true  height  off  the ground,,  THIS IS A FIRST for  any  of  the 
current generation of flight-sims!!  (In other recent flight-sims, 
a  'low'  altitude where you are skimming the  treetops  seems  to 
start at about 2000ft and they are NOT in proportion to real-world 
scales of measurement..)

Although  it is not immediately apparent in your initial  training 
mission which is across a vast expanse of sea at night,  the level 
of  ground  detail and number of ground  features  is  impressive. 
Microprose have attempted to duplicate, as far as possible, actual 
geographic features ie) mountains,  cities, military installations 
and  other ground features common to a particular area.  They  all 
have a logical pattern, rather than spread randomly about, and you 
can see,  at a given altitude, what you would get from the cockpit 
of a real aircraft (within reason and the ST's capabilities..) The 
update  speed of the graphics is very reasonable and is  sometimes 
very fast (Usually when you are on a final approach to a target or 
runway,everything just crowds in really quickly!!)

F19  includes  more features than you can shake a stick  at,  Four 
levels of enemy,  with varying intelligence,  loadsa weapons, that 
is  twenty or more for your own use,  and even more enemy nasties, 
twenty-five different types of aircraft and hundreds of  missions. 
I  would  say that this is going to be  THE  flight-simulator  for 
1990,  and it is especially worth getting if you take this kind of 
thing  seriously  as it has a lot more to get to grips  with  than 
anything else out at this time,  it can also be recommended if you 
are only 'into' this sort of thing on a lighthearted way as it has 
'easy  options  to  enable  you to  get  in  quickly...It  is  not 
recommended  if you only have two braincells to rub together,  but 
those sort of people A) won't be reading 'Diskmaggie' anyway,  and 
B) own Amigas (nuff said...)

LAST  PARAGRAPH:- There is one TINY niggle,  the keyboard overlay, 
which  you cut out to fit over your ST keyboard whilst playing   
seems  to  need  a  surgeons  laser  scalpel  to  get  it  to  sit 
comfortably on your machine..  This is only a TINY niggle,  and it 
is possible to 'Customise' the overlay to fit,- eventually...It is 
an expensive program,  but worth buying as you get excellent value 
for  money,  anyway,  thirty  quid can be thought of as one-and-a-
half crap games (at œ20.00 a time..) and in my opinion, Microprose 
deserve to reap the reward of their efforts on this one. This fits 
into the category of 'Good games even pirates would pay for' It is 
virtually unplayable without the manual and overlay anyway........

   B U Y  I T !!!!!  I haven't been this keen on anything for 
a very long time!!!!!   Regards CIH (C) 30/07/90


I have in my possession a 1/72 scale model kit of the F19  Stealth 
fighter,   which  was  originally  part  of  the  computer  shop's 
promotional   pack...   This  is  down  to  the  frankly  peculiar 
relationship  I  have with them,  as I did'nt really want it,  but 
they decided to be 'generous' anyway,  for the same reason, I have 
about  3 million keyrings,  posters etc,  any offers for the model 
kit to the usual address.............



F19 Stealth Fighter
-------------------
by Microprose

There are some games you can learn from. Did you know (e.g.) that 
an F 117-A (the real stealth fighter) can see through mountains? 
Or that with advanced technology it's possible to spot a 
missile boat a hundred miles away while flying closest to the 
ground at maximum speed? Or have you heard anywhere else about 
the new enemy aircraft tactics all around the world, which 
consists in flying straight towards any good guy just to check 
whether there are still some bullets in his cannon? To put it in 
a nutshell, this game hasn't half as much reality to offer than 
the advertisement seems to promise. And, as a (proud) owner of 
falcon, I now allow myself to compare those two programs, as 
Microprose allowed themselves the same but seem to have overseen 
a few facts.

GRAPHICS:
F 19 wins hands down when it comes to scenary, frame update or 
introductory graphics. It all looks great and makes Falcon seem 
pretty poor. The only thing missing are the cockpit graphics, 
which are reduced to two computerscreens and a few warning-
lights.

SOUND:
F 19 sounds really, really poor. Engine sounds are just a rustle 
and there's only one kind of explosion in one loudness for simply 
everithing that goes bang, from the enemy radar twenty miles away 
to your own fighter. Falcon lies miles ahead with its digi-voice, 
real hard engine noises and so on.

REALITY:
I can't say very much about F 19 (except the things I already 
said), but Falcon is currently used by the american army to train 
their pilots, so it must come quite close.

WEAPONS/STRATEGYS:
In F 19 you need a good tactique to outperform the enemy radar 
stations, but bombing is fairly easy. Although you've got about 
tweny bombs to choose, a Maverick will do it for nearly 
everything. And when you've got one ready, just select your 
target with your trackcamera and release your stuff as soon as 
the "missile locked" message appears. Piece of cake. In Falcon, 
you have more types of targets and they are harder to hit, too. 
You won't find moving trains or trucks in F 19, and aircraft 
behave more or less the same, although there are many different 
ones. I prefer the single MiG in Falcon, which is much more 
intelligent too (and has got a mean cannon, while your F 19 
opponents only have missiles).

GETTING DOWN:
Landing in Falcon is a pain, but on the Mission Disk, it's quite 
good. In F 19, landing itself is okay, but leaving the runway 
is deadly. Because of this the parachute is perhaps the best 
solution to return safe.
Getting down with enemy help is much easier in Falcon. One 
single, well placed missile might be enough. Too, bullets or 
(Mission Disk) smaller missiles can cause quite tricky damage, 
such as jammed weapons or malfunction in the oxygen support, 
forcing you to fly low, where the air is thick. In F 19, you need 
some ten missiles to get damaged, and in most cases you wouldn't 
even recognise the damage without your damage screen. The only 
vital damage to happen is to your engine, which will after two or 
three hits be too weak to hold your fighter in the air. However, 
once you're in radar track, you'll be hit by a missile every five 
seconds (quite inevitably), so you'll come down most probably 
within a minute or two.

SIGHTS:
In F 19, you can see everything within some 60 or 70 miles, and 
some more things. All you have to do is to tell the trackcam 
whether you'd like to have the menue-plan for ground, air, or 
navigation, and you will be shown everything there is around you. 
Too, you can look at your in-cockpit screen which will present 
you a nice overheadview with all radars, missiles and everything 
else. Once you've selected your target, you can switch to 
missile view, target view and so on, all looking very nice. In 
fact, you could fly a whole mission without looking out of the 
cockpit, just by the aid of trackcam and overhead/map view. 
Falcon again is a bit harder, as your radar has a quite small 
angle and only works ahead, and the rest is up to your eye. In 
fact, a MiG with its radar off can sneak behind you unseen and 
give you a very bad surprise present in the form of a heat-
seeker, if you don't pay attention.

FEELING:
In my opinion, the realistic sound and the cockpit-graphics are 
worth more than the considerably better vector graphics and 
additional pixel-orientated graphics of F 19. In Falcon, you 
really have the feeling of a cockpit as well as a 
sensible bit of technology around you. Whatever you want to do, 
you have to check first whether your bird will do it or not. It 
might be fatal flying hard manoevers with some heavy bombs under 
your wings. In F 19, the only moment where you will realise the 
limitations of your vehicle is when you have a stall warning, and 
this will pass quite soon and not be very dangerous. At first 
glance, F 19 seems the clear winner, but as soon as you have seen 
the scenery (which will take some hours though) you'll start 
missing all those little bits that make Falcon (in my opinion) 
still the best one.


RATINGS:

The CONCEPT is not very original anyway, but does it always have 
to be the best piece of technology you're controlling (like 
gunship and silent service before)? For this amount of money, I 
would expect more of a simulator and less of a shoot 'em up.
65%

The GRAPHICS are really great. It's the best vectorcraphics I've 
ever seen; it's just a pity that most is only scenery.
98%

The SOUND... well, silence about it.
37%

The GAMEPLAY is quite similar to Gunship (when it comes to the 
feeling anyway), but there are only few missions and most are 
similar. Why isn't there a mission to destroy tanks or 
submarines, or what about one where you have to locate a POW-
Camp? All is there, only the mission is missing.
87% (if you dont expect "the real thing" of the advert, that is)
