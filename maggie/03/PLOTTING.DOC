          ' PLOTTING - by Ocean....The potato strikes '
          ' back.......  by (C)IH 10/9/90.....        '
          '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This  is  a  funny  little game which  came  to  Ocean  c/o  Taito 
Corporation,  and  it  seems to be one of the lesser-known  puzzle 
based coin-ops subsequently converted to home machines...

In it,  you are.......  Squidgy ( Well what do you call a slightly 
animated  potato,  or is it a 'Richard the Third'???) Your mission 
is  to  'lose' as many bricks on screen as possible,  by  chucking 
whatever  brick  you have to hand at the time  at  an  identically 
patterned one on the pile.  Simple, apart from when you run out of 
appropriate  bricks  to hit,  or run out of time,  and you have to 
plan  somewhat  ahead which bricks to go for (A  strategy  element 
OOOOOOOH!..)

Apart from various obstacles in later levels, that is all there is 
to  the  basic  game,   the  simplicity  supposedly  providing  an 
addictive  'hook'  seen  in a lot of other puzzle  games  such  as 
Tetris or Pipemania.  (In this case,  for me, it don't..) It seems 
you have to look too far ahead, and you cannot easily get into the 
game  playing  'blind' IE) without a clue,  just to see  what  its 
like.......

Graphically,  reasonably  attractive,  but  hardly 'Shadow of  the 
beast' standard,  the 'blobby' looking...well...  blobby,  and the 
tiles  looking  like  part of someones  Mah  Jong  set.  Sonically 
speaking, some competant soundchip music, title and level tunes...

To sum up,  I'm afraid, nothing to really get my attention in this 
one.  (On the other hand,  nothing to annoy me either,  other than 
the price.. œ19.95 is too dear for a game like this..)
