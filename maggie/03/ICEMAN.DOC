Now it's time to get familiar with the controls of the sub.
The best thing to do is read the manual very carefully.
A few basic operations are.
The + key on the numeric pad is throttle up.
Push it one time=slow, 2 times=speed 1/3 ,3 times=speed 2/3,4 times=full speed.
Arrow key left=steer left,arrow key right=steer right.If you push them more
than once you will turn faster.
Arrow key down=dive,arrow key up= ???? up.You've already guessed it.
For the other nice gadgets on board the sub,please refer to your manual.
Now we are going to take her out for a little test run.
"CLOSE HATCH".Now follow the instructions that the captain gives to you.
He will direct you to your first waypoint.
When the captain wants you to acknowledge green board ,"GREEN BOARD".
When you have to acknowledge that you've reached a certain depth just type
"DEPTH ATTAINED".When the captain orders,all stop, push the - key until
all the lights of the throttle indicator are blue.
Make sure that the dive planes are horizontal before you leave your seat.

It's the route that you will have to travel to get to tunesia.
"READ ORDERS".When you're done reading the orders,"GET COMBINATION".

Now follow the captain out of his cabin and walk up to the chart table in the
middle of the sub.,"LOOK TABLE".Now you have to plot a course to get to
tunesia,following the map that you've studied earlier."PLOT COURSE".
Use the arrow keys to change the coordinates.
These next coordinates are a example of a route.
You start at 30,170. next 70,170  85,80  85,15  80,5  65,25.
If 65,25 does not work try 65,22.Press ENTER to accept a coordinate.
If some one out there get's the ultimate route,please let us now.
How better your route,the more points you get.
"EXIT".Now follow the captains instructions to get to your next waypoint.
(Note:periscope depth is about 70f).When you have reached periscope depth
"EXIT".Walk to the two periscopes next to the radio and sonar man.
"UP SCOPE","LOOK SCOPE".Leave the scope and walk to the radio man.
He's the one on the right."TALK MAN".
Write down the washington and cia codes.They are different each time.
Walk to the captains hut."OPEN SAFE","23448803","OPEN CASE","762134".
"INSERT ID","INSERT FILM".Write down the message and the codes.
The A stands for Army,the N for Navy,the AF for Air Force and the M stands

"LOOK CODE BOOK".Write doen the codes.
A=0,B=8,C=6,D=4,E=2,F=1,G=3,H=5,I=7 AND J=9.
Now if you want to now the cia codes just add 3 to all the numbers.
If the number is greater then 10,just subtract 10.
(You have to do this because you're in the ???? ,yes, Navy).
So the cia codes are.
A=3,B=1,C=9,D=7,E=5,F=4,G=6,H=8,I=0 AND J=2.
Now you can decode the washington and cia codes into two sets of three numbers
These numbers represent: page,line,word.
Now look in your manual on those pages and find the word on that page.
(They are in the red squares on that page).
Now you've got two sets of two words.Enter these words into the computer.
Walk to the computer,"TURN COMPUTER ON".
Now you have translated the codes.

injured.It's now up to you to guide the sub safely to tunesia.
Go directly to your seat.Set speed to slow.dive below 600 feet and turn silent
run on.when you reach a depth below 600 feet trun your engine of.
Now wait a while until you see the white line coming to you.
This is the distance that the ship is from you.

Now wait for the white line, representing the eneny sub ,to pass over you.
The sub will turn and come back.When the sub is almost leaving,fire a stinger
at him.Repeat this sequence until you've hit the sub twice.
Use decoys,or just let the torpedos pass by.
You can also wait until the sub leaves.This will ofcourse give you less points.
Eight hours later of the coast of portugal.Sonar contact.
Use your active sonar to give one ping to the ship waiting there.
The ships turns out to be the USS coontz.
Now steer the sub to the cross on the screen ,representing the ship.
