PERESTROIKA
-----------
by Paragraph (Russia)


Knives are not bad in a game. Guns are better, especially if it's 
a machine-gun with a 8-Bit 10 KHz supa-dupa wobba-wobba sound. Of 
course a few grenades or any other kind of multi-killing weapon 
will improve fun even more. And not to forget about several 
dozens of enemys, all quite stupid and badly equipped, so there 
is plenty to do for the player.

At least, that's what Mr. Cigal, vice-president of Atari USA and 
most likely the man to distribute the "Perestroika"-game thinks 
that we average gameplayers are thinking.

Myself, I go to the arcade quite often and i've played many a 
mow-em-down-type game at home, too. Now I feel like having had 
enough of it, so I was simply astonished by the pure idea of this 
not-at-all mow-em-down game. Here it's the opposite: you take the 
role of the "pioneer of perestroika", and it's the enemy who has 
all the deadly stuff. In addition to the Idea, there are the 
superb graphics and the very well working mouse controls. It's simply 
perfect.

In the game, you see an overhead view of the room (look at the 
screenshot for further information), which is very well done. You 
can clearly identify all enemies and friends, and the game can 
cope easily with some ten or more sprites at the same time. As I 
already said, you control the pioneer of perestroika, and your aim is
to liberate a huge burocrazy-building and bring the perestroika 
to all those poor burocrats. These are shown as red 
figures and not dangerous for you. Then there's a "Big 
Bureaucrat" on each floor who is afraid of you and running away 
if you get too close. Your first target in each room should be to 
lead him into his office, placed at the top of the screen. Once 
he's in, you follow him and get into some sort of subgame, in which 
you have to complete a portrait in a set amount of time to bring 
the big bureaucrat on your side. Those portraits range from 
Gorbachev (of course!) over Komehni, Kohl and Thatcher to Reagan 
and Bush, all very well drawn and a different one in each room. 
Once the big bureaucrat is on your side, all ordinary bureaucrats 
are afraid and try to escape or hide in a corner. If you touch 
one he gets into some sort of thinking-process, and after a short 
time he either joins you or blows up. This way, you get more and 
more followers, until everyone will be on your side or fallen in 
combat (more likely, of course, is that you fall in combat 
yourself after just some two or three rooms...). To make things 
easier you can take control over any allied guy in the same room 
as your figure or make him follow it. Like that, you can hunt 
bureaucrats in a much more effective way (a five-to-one 
superiority doesn't let one lots of space to sneak past...).
 
But as in real life, the perestroika doesnt't only have friends. 
In the game, there are three types of enemies to watch out for. 
They all track you once they get close enough to you, and it's 
sometimes quite hard to get rid  of them. First type of enemy is 
the "Militaryman" (in the grey uniform), who is throwing any 
of your followers or you out of the room whenever he gets one. He's 
not very dangerous and skillful players might escape him. However 
it's quite hard to reassemble your group after some action of 
their side, as people can be thrown into different rooms, some 
perhaps still under enemy control. Then, there's the soldier. He 
will try to kill (blow up) the person you are actually 
controlling, but you can quite well handle him by keeping in some 
distance. The third one is really dangerous: the KGB-Agent. He 
will not only try to kill you but any of your fellows, which can 
have a devastating effect on your troop (and be very dangerous to 
yourself).

There's just one way to stop the enemies: turn them into friends. 
To do so, you (and every guy you get on your side) have up to
four passports. You can drop these by accessing a little menue (you 
can do this anytime by pressing a mouse button) and re-collect 
them by walking over them. If you can lead a militaryman over a 
passport, he'll transform into a bureaucrat, making it possible for 
you to persuade or defeat him. In the same manner, you can 
transform a soldier into a militaryman or a KGB-agent into a 
soldier. But be careful with your passports, as it's very hard to 
handle a KGB-agent without one.

The game features a save-game option too, which is really 
necessary as you'll have at least eight hours to liberate all 
rooms. To make things worse, left-over bureaucrats will elect new 
big bureaucrats and also try and transform some of your fellows 
back.

Now to the Ratings:

The CONCEPT is absolutely brill, and a lot of things in the game 
are "just like real", such as a counter-revolutionary movement. 
There hasn't been such an original concept for ages: 
98 %

The GRAPHICS are simply great, from the animated Gorbie on the 
title screen down to the sprites and even potplants. There's a lot of 
detail and simply no confusing element; everything is clear and 
your eyes won't hurt that soon (play ROTOX for more than twenty 
minutes and you know what I mean). A well diserved
95 %

SOUND isn't rated, as the game does neither need nor offer much 
of it. Anyway, there's a good digi-song at the beginning and the 
effects used are supporting the gameplay. And after all, you need 
all your concentration for the game.

The GAMEPLAY is really challenging, and it does offer a quite 
high difficulty level. During play you'll find new tactics to handle 
the enemies as well as improving your skills in the ones you 
already have found out. The superb mixture of strategy and action 
as well as the fact that all fits together very well makes this a 
clear winner for me. I only hope that there won't be too many 
changes (Mr. Cigal seems to be wanting some), so there'll still be
the actual
96%

NOTE:
The Game was developped in one and a half years by Georgy 
Pachikov (Chief of the Game department), his brother Stephan and 
Stanislav Tchemakin (Senior Research Scientist). The graphics 
were done by Georgy Pachikov and Mr. Tchemakin is responsible for 
the programming. The game was (at least in my opinion) finished 
when I played it, but it seems as if the last word in this affair 
is spoken by Mr. Cigal.
