The  other  day  I was looking through my disk box  when  I  came 
across  a disk which I didn't recognise.  Quickly I inserted  the 
disk and loaded up.  Wow, it was the first disk MAGGIE! I thought 
I'd  lost this disk ages ago and so I began to read  (again)  the 
articles  I had forgotten about.  One such article was  something 
called  "Golden  Oldies"  where old games  were  reviewed  incase 
anyone decided to buy one. This seemed like a good idea to me but 
then  I realised that there was no such article in  MAGGIE  2.  I 
then took a look at my games disk box.  Then I had an  idea.  You 
may  have guessed already (if you were clever enough to read  the 
title) but I decided to do some Golden Oldie reviews myself.  For 
this  article I think I'll concentrate on my Super Pack games  as 
these  are probably the oldest I own.  I think I'll miss out  the 
ones  that have been reviewed already though and these ones  will 
be  very short as I have a lot to get through.  To start  with  I 
think  I  better  go and play all the games coz  I  haven't  even 
looked at them for ages..........................................
.................................................................
...............Right, I've played the first two games so its time 
to get down to business. By the way, because there  are  so  many 
games  I will only be reviewing ten of them this  month.  Also  I 
won't  put any Value for money ratings as I don't know  how  much 
the games cost these days.

                ARKANOID II REVENGE OF DOH

ARKANOID II (as if you didn't know) is a BREAKOUT clone.  I  have 
to  admit that this was the first ST game I was ever  adicted  to 
(it  was also the first game I ever played on the ST but that  is 
besides  the point).  I'm not sure what the games about  but  its 
something  like DOH came here from another dimension in  a  large 
space ship.  Your in your little Vause II (I think thats what  it 
is) ship and you have to go around inside his space ship knocking 
his interplanetary force field (thats bricks to you and me)  down 
using  your  photon  super duper  ultra  wicked  electrical  high 
powered laser bolts (balls, no I mean that you use balls to knock 
down.....oh  never mind).  When you complete a level you  have  a 
choice  of of two next levels.  It is some times quite  important 
which way you go as one of the levels can be alot harder than the 
other.
Effects
Grafixxxxx  are about as good as they can be for a Breakout  game 
and sounds are pretty dinky to.  Apart from that there isn't much 
to it though.

Right  then,  I think before I start the second review I'll  type 
some useless info:
 
                USELESS INFOMATION

After doing the ARKANOID 2 review I:
      Ate 124 3/4 chips with loadsa salt, vinegar and sause.
      Drank a can of Tango.
      Had alot of ice cream.
      Very slightly just about half tidied part of my very  small 
bedroom (my Mum made me do it!)

That's enough of that, on with the reviews:
 
                   BUGGY BOY

Once  BUGGY BOY has loaded you have a choice of 5 tracks to  race 
on:  Off road, North, South, East and West. Once you have decided 
this  the race begins.  One thing I find disapointing about  this 
game is that you don't race against other cars.  It's all against 
the clock.  On the track there are a selection of points  bonuses 
and time flags which give you more time (no really?!) at the  end 
of a stage.  While you are racing you have to go through  tunnels 
(you explode if you miss them) and bridges (you fall in the water 
if  you miss them).  On the whole this game is quite exciting  to 
play  although  it  gets  very annoying  when  you  cock  up  and 
obstical.
Effects
Your  view  point  is  situated just behind  the  buggy  you  are 
controlling  and  the grafixxxxx are quite good.  Sound  is  very 
basic though and I feel that the FX good have been  better.  Also 
(like Arkanoid) there is no backround musix to boogy along to. If 
there had have been they could have called it BOOGYING BUGGY BOY!

                     BLACK LAMP

BLACK LAMP is a sort of horizontal  adventure  shoot 'em up. Your 
character is a jester and for some reason (I cann't remeber what) 
you  have  to  collect lots  of  different  coloured  lamps.  You 
andventure takes place in and around a castle and there are  lots 
of  enemys to stop you.  Apart from moving from left to right  on 
the screen you can also take ladders up and down and if there  is 
a  door on the screen you can go through.  Once you go through  a 
door  you  can  see where it is as there  are  two  little  white 
markers telling you where it is. If you haven't seen the game you 
probably  don't  know what I'm talking about and  I  couldn't  be 
bothered  to  go  into any more detail so  you'll  have  to  stay 
baffled  for  the rest of your life (unless you buy the  game  of 
course).
Effects
The  sprites  are of a reasonable size but are not very  detailed 
(a bit like this article!).  The backrounds are nice as well, but 
again aren't very detailed. When you first load this game you get 
a nice bouncy tune but I think this carrys on while you play. The 
sound FX are fairly good.

                    CHOPPER X

When  this  game first came out it only cost œ14.99 but  I  don't 
know how much it costs now.  CHOPPER X is a vertically  scrooling 
shoot 'em up where you are the controller of some Chopper.  Among 
you enemys are planes,  boats, tanks, anti chopper guns any a vew 
more besides. Once you load up a catchy tune starts to play which 
stays  with yo u for the whole game and does begin to get  a  bit 
annoying when you play it for along time. The first few times you 
play this game you probably won't like it coz the hardest part in 
level  one is the first two enemys which shoot at you as soon  as 
you  start to play.  Another thing that is annoying is  they  way 
that  you are dumped right back at the start of a level when  you 
get shot, no matter how close you are to the end. That said, this 
is  a very enjoyable game and I played it alot when I  first  got 
it.
Effects
Grafixxx  are  okay but nothing special and the  sound  is  quite 
good.  I think it would have been better if the muzix was  played 
at  a lower volume while playing the game and the FX was  louder. 
Still, musn't grumble.

                   EDDIE EDWARDS SUPER SKI

Remember good old Eddie?  Yes that's right,  he was that no hoper 
ski  jumping  dick.  Someone can't have thought he was  that  bad 
however  as a game was made with his name on it.  Although  Eddie 
"the  tit..er  I mean Eagle" Edwards was only a ski  "jumper"  in 
this game you can participate in four different  events;  Slalam, 
Giant slalam,  Down hill and,  of course,  the jump.  On the main 
screen you have a choice of practice,  competion, high scores and 
a couple of other things.  You control Eddie himself, viewing him 
from behind and looking down the slope.
Effects
The grafixxx on this game are very good indeed with trees in  the 
backround  and people cheering you on at the side of  the  track. 
When you crash you go into comical mode as you turn into a  giant 
snow ball.  There is no muzix on this game and the FX aren't  the 
best but this doesn't really matter in this sort of game.

              MORE USELESS INFORMATION

While writing the rest of this article (after Arkanoid) I:
      Ate one medium sized chocolate bar, a Kit Kat and two Jaffa 
      cakes
      Drank one mug of lemon squash
      Went to the bog once 
      Picked my nose three times
I  have decided to do only five reviews instead of  ten.  If  you 
want  to  read more reviews get MAGGIE 4.  This means  that  this 
article ends here.
