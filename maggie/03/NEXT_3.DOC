
Part III of the Convention im Marseille:

Hi!  This is Fury again!!!  The Demo Competition will soon start. 
The  participants  are  currently:   Aenigmatica,  Galtan  6,  Us 
(Replicants), ULM, Next, Axe (maybe), BBC.
We'll  see who are still in the race in a few hours.
Shit, I don't know what to say anymore except that Zae's keyboard 
on which I am writing is even worse than QWERTY keyboards!!!  The 
space bar needs at least a pression of 200 kg to work!!!

                         Fury  signing off,  see ya in  a  while, 
                         when inspiration comes to me.

(Uh!      I      forgot     the     mega      packable      sign: 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

YEAHHHHH!!!!!  Finally,  Derek  stopped talking on the  phone!!!! 
This  sucker started to call about 2 hours ago in  the  USA,  and 
he's finally over!!! I just can't believe it, he's done!!! I just 
HAD  to  mention  this fact as it is one of  the  most  important 
things that happened today... See ya!!!

( Andy here :  The most important fact will appear next week when 
Fury's parents get their phone bill!!!!!!!!!!!! )

Derek  here:  Hello I have just been quizzed by the  Replicants,I 
think  I defended myself and have proved I am no spy for The  BBC 
and The Empire (or so they think hehehehehe........)
Special  message to Angel Face :  Look forward to talking to  you 
soon.........
sammy joe:you are a blond deutsch fucker;you screw men only.....
fury:you have a saggy arse?

Derek you are the most significant member of the specie called:
  The dick-headed pig monkeys,  whose normal state is hanging  on 
  the phone. The most important feature of this specie is to have 
  a  brain not bigger than a pea,  with an  oversized  skull.  This 
  brain is only able to control 3 life functions: eat (dirty!!!)
                                                  dial numbers
                                                  speak for  hours 
                                                  on the phone.

THE REPLICANTS : After long reflexion, it is now official 
DELIGHT HAS left THE EMPIRE coz they finnally realised
that they are only lamers and source stolers (hey ILLEGAL !)
and they have been touched by the light of the REPLICANTS .
EMPIRE IS NOW AGAIN THE WORSE FUCKING LAMER CREW WORLDWIDE.
                
Time: 1:55 (EN, heh)

This  is  an overview of the happenings of  today  (yesterday  in 
fact), the 24th of July 1990 in Marseille.

As usual, the morning started uneventful, but at about 2 o' clock 
the first party went to the beach, today concistsing of Sammy Joe 
,  The Nutty Snake,  Phil the Pilot,  MOB,  and our French driver 
whose  name  I can't remember right now.  This time we took  a  2 
litre bottle of pepsi-cola with us,  1 French bread,  and about 4 
breadrolls.  We splashed around a bit,  swam some circles  played 
some  with  the ball,  and then noticed 2 very nice  young  girls 
lying  on the beach behind us.  They were nice.  One  was  Really 
nice.  The  only  irritating factor was that next to  them  their 
parent were sunning too.  After about 3 hours of staring, waving, 
throwing  balls at them,  staring some more,  we decided to  take 
some  action.  MOB was really interested,  so we took a piece  of 
paper on which the phone-number of Fury's house was written,  and 
he would give it to the nicest one.  They stayed in the water for 
a very long time,  and when they came out, they were out of reach 
for a little reluctant MOB.  We kept on staring though,  and when 
they decided to leave,  we left too,  and tried to find out  what 
the  license  plate  number of their car  was.  A  furious  chase 
followed, and at the end, all we got was a friendly wave from the 
Very Beautiful Girl.

Right  now  (2:28) the Demo-Programming Competition is  about  40 
minutes old.  Participants are:  Zanac (The  Vision/Aenigmatica), 
Gunstick and The Fate (ULM), LTK and Mr. Spirit (Mystik), DBug II 
(NeXT),  Crush (MCA/Aenigmatica), Fury, DOM and Maxi (Replicants) 
and   Sammy   Joe,   MOB  and  The   Nutty   snake   (TLB,   BBC, 
QX/Aenigmatica).  I, The Nutty Snake, will bring you a minute-to-
minute report of this coding extravaganza.

(2:46) - after 50 minutes,  ULM have already finished the  source 
for the Sync-scroller they are going to use.         

Rumours: - - DOM and Maxi are not coding yet, they will join Fury 
in  the morning - - Sammy Joe,  MOB and TNS are not  starting  to 
code until the morning too. - - Is the confidence of these groups 
in  their capabilities so high that they think the sleep will  do 
them well?

(3:00)  - fury has not yet started!!!  - NeXT has a BUG  -  Zanac 
complains about the Keyboard interrupts.
Hi here's Zanac...why do I save 9 MFP registers and I only put  7 
of 'em back when leaving??

(3:10)  - TNS is beginning to draw the graphics for  his  group's 
screen - Fury is starting now... no, he's starting soon.

Hi there guzs ž Aaaaarghh !!!!! A german fuckin' kezboqrd !!!!!!
Well, ZAE on the keyboard trying to bullshit on that ž!"Ý$%&/()=
german kezboqrd....  It's the first stuff I write in this article
and I don't think that it's gonna be very interesting (I heard  a 
lamer saying "as always...") Fuuuuuck !!!!!!!!!  Oh !  Fury  just 
told  me that the !  were good to pack so have some extra ones  : 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!         Funny         !         : 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh yeahhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well,  stop  that lamering.....and  stop 
that fuckin' text coz' this !"Ý$%&/()= german keyboard is driving 
me crazy : I'll come back when I'll find a lovely french keyboard ! 
Oh ! I was about to forget, let's pack : !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ahahahaha!!!!!  ZAE's  just hit his knee on my bed!!!!  And  now, 
he's rolling on the floor screaming with pain!!! Hehehehe!!! Good 
thing, now he'll look where he walks!!!
Still speaking is Fury: I'm currently in my room together with (a 
dozen of pretty nude maidens grabbing his suits...  Dizzy signing 
off!!!),  so,  I'm with Dizzy,  MIT (who's listening to the  most 
boring muzak I've ever heard,  it only  goes:  Bom!  Bom!  Tchac! 
Zioum!  Oh Yeah!  Tchicitchicitchi!  Mr Bond!  Bam!  Bam! Bloing! 
Bloing!  Vzoum! Etc... How boring!!! I now understand why he's so 
lame!!! (Packing time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Hehehe!!!)  I  now hand the keyboard (ouch!  My eye  you  scum... 
erh... You magnificent Fury... Dizzy signing off!!!) to Dizzy....

"Please would you get the keyboard,  O great master, magnifiscent 
wonder of the both univers " (Fury signing off...)
What a shiting noise!  I'm talking about MIT's musak. After bomb, 
Pink  Floyd,  the  one to survive !!!!  Here's Dizzy  typing  at 
NeXT/Replicants summer convention where there's only a few  food, 
no  beds and no maidens to fill em.  I'm now fighting to  include 
some of my graphics (overall maidens) in this MAGGIE, third of the 
name.  I'd  like  to send a mega smelly wet shit to some  of  the 
teachers that,  when we grew up and went to school,  would  hurt 
the children anyways they could.  By pouring their derision  upon 
everything  we did and exposing every weakness however  carefully 
hidden by the kids.  But in the town it was well known, at night, 
when they got home their fat and psychopatic wives would trash em 
within inches of their lives... Hi Roger Waters...
 The neighboor have just complained because of the noise...
Time  to  give the keyboard,  i got nothing more to say  for  the 
instant... have a coke, a good night and a nice trip...

this is snake 
hi i'm just arrive from my dream because twenty minutes ago
i was drunk but now i'm ok and i can go to the swimimg pool
ok i'm q little bit drunk now i have to walk a little..  And sure 
that I have a little dick..... sure ahahahahhahahahahaah
the best one is DOM after MINIMAX of, course...........

                    buuuuuuuurrrrrrpppppp....


youhou here is filon who write for maggie-bole (french play word)

Hi there,  this is the Fate of ULM.  We still haven't started our 
screen  for  the competition.  We only have  done  a  sync-scroll 
routine  and  a  scrolling but the scrolling  isn't  yet  working 
fine...  Anyway we don't have any idea what to do and so  perhaps 
there  won't be a screen by ULM...  The other screens I saw  till 
now  do look good but I don't think that there's  something  very 
good,   revolutionary...  As  you  are  surely  bored  with  this 
nonsense,  I do stop now.  Anyway I'm rather tired and I want  to 
sleep now. So that's all, see you tomorrow....

Zae again !!!!!!!!!!!  (pack ! pack ! pack !) It's still the same 
fuckin'  !"Ý$%&/( german keyboard so I'll come back later  hoping 
to find a french kezboqrd.

HERE IS A VERY VERY INTERESTING PIECE OF INFO FOR YOUR: 

                  THE WORD C H A R T S I:

These  charts  deal with the words that have been used  the  most 
during the convention:
     
                    1. L A M E R    (everybody said that at  least 
                                    once)
                    2. B O L L O X  (the word was introduced by me 
                                    Sammy  Joe  and  then  became 
                                    Zae's  most used  word.  Soon 
                                    everybody began to use it).
                    3. G I R L S    (this  word was only used  by 
                                    the  people   who  stayed  at 
                                    Alexis place(Me/Phil)).
                    4. F O O D      (As we were always short  of 
                                    food  somebody  was   always 
                                    moaning the word)
                    5. C  O M P U T E R (this word  should  have 
                                    been more at the top  but  I 
                                    reckon that the others  were 
                                    actually used more often)
   
Here  ends the realtime article.  The reason for this is that  it 
was  very very hot at the time and there weren't enough  computer 
as  most of them were being used for the  demo  competition.  The 
night  before some of guys got badly drunk and began  to  rampage 
around in the house so that the neighbours got so pissed off that 
they  decided to get all of us chucked out of Fury's  appartment. 
People then began to get their stuff together in order to  leave. 
At about 10am  some people had already left the party.  As me and 
Phil could not really be bothered to leave already in the  middle 
of  the  week we decided to find another place to  stay  at,  our 
prey was ALEXIS.  He did not have any objections whatsoever so we 
began to pack our things and he,  the man himself, Alexis that is 
drove us to his house were we quickly unpacked our bags and  went 
to the beach. 

The  beach,  I think that this is definitely the place where  the 
SAMMY JOE/PHIL/JOSEF/ALEXIS COOPERATION SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME. 
I  think that by the end of the party I copied about 5  disks  of 
which  2 did not even work.  Back to the more important  subject, 
the beach.  We always tried to be at the beach at about 11am  but 
never managed that as we always stayed up very late chasing after 
girls  at  some fair that was takling place at the same  time  in 
Marseille.  I  have no real idea where I should start so  I  will 
just take about all the things in general. 
On the Saturday,  the 28th of July,  we decided to have some sort 
of a beach party with some girls.  Chris of TGE said that he  had 
organized  a  girl for him and 2 other girls (what a  shame  that 
they  did  not show up !).  The two girls that  I  had  organized 
(Brigitte  and Carine) did come at about 8pm.  At that  time  was 
already  pretty drunk because I had my special drink (Snake  Bite 
Black,  after a few pints of that,  your are definitely  gone!!). 
Anyway,  all  the rest than also began to drink and AXE  began  a 
competition  with Andy the Arfling to find out who can  take  the 
most drinks (more to that later)! I mixed a few other drinks like 
coke+vodka  and orengina+whisky.  Everybody then began to  drink, 
drink,  drink  and drink.  At about 10.30pm Brigitte  and  Carine 
decided  to go swimming and me and Alexis decided to go  also  as 
they  look  very nice in the swimsuits (if you want to  know  how 
they look,  simply look at the slideshow on one of the data disks 
 (or wherever I will be putting the pictures)!  We then  swam for 
about 30 minutes and then brought the girls home. Most of us then 
went rampaging through Marseille practising the Replicangs  sport 
(shaking lamps) and generally enjoying ourselves. Later on in the 
night the decision was pretty easy to make to decide who won  the 
drinking competition.  It was AXE (but then again i think that he 
did not really drink as much as Andy did). Andy had to be carried 
about for the rest of the evening as he could not even stand  up. 
As  soon as somebody put him on his own two feet,  he  fell  over 
again  (it was a very funny sight).  At about 3.30 am we  finally 
went home to get some sleep as we wanted to get up early to go to 
the beach again. The net morning (the Sunday) it was pouring down 
with  rain  the sky was flashing as if god was  using  a  massive 
flashlight to make a picture of his earth.  Anyway, no weather to 
go to the beach.  Coming towards the evening we had to leave  but 
decided to stay for another 2 days and stay 'til  Tuesday.  These 
two  days were definitely worth staying as we went to  the  disco 
all  the  coming  night and chatted up  millions  of  girls.  Zae 
spotted soem German ones and I (as I am Germam) had to chat  them 
up  for  him !!!  In the other two night we met  some  more  nice 
girls...  Oh, in the last night I chatted up a girl and you would 
not believe it,  she even owns an Atari 520STFM.  I then talk  to 
her  for  a  little  while and after some  time  ('cause  of  the 
language  problems)  she told me that she has even heard  of  TLB 
and  others  !!  I can tell you,  she was definitely  the  nicest 
female Atari ST user that I have ever encountered. 

Coming  up the the last day of our stay in Marseille we  realised 
that  we did not have any sleep for the last 3 days,  well to  be 
honest we had about 1 hour of sleep before we went on the train. 
The  journey home was again VERY VERY interesting as we met  some 
more  girls  but I have been told by others (some member  of  the 
BBC) that if I put it in writing,  I will not be able to type any 
more articles for Issue 4 'cause he will do horrible things to my 
fingers.  I did a pictures of what was going on which you  should 
be  able  to find somewhere in the magazine (if it  was  not  too 
dark  when I took it as the flashlight would have given  me  away 
(the picture is of TWO VERY VERY DIFFERENT PAIR OF FEET).

THAT'S REALLY IT NOW FOR THE COPY PARTY.


FINALLY  I  WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW THINGS TO THE  ORGANISERS  ON 
BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE CONVENTION:

I (SAMMY JOE) AND DEFINITELY PHIL OF BBC  AND ALL THE OTHERS  WHO 
CAME TOO HAD A GREAT TIME IN MARSEILLE.  WE RECKON THAT YOU DID A 
GREAT JOB IN PUTTING ALL THE THINGS TOGETHER ALTHOUGH THEIR  WERE 
SOME 'MINOR' PROBLEMS HERE AND THEIR.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY A 
MEGA BIG THANKS TO FURY WHO ALLOWED US TO STAY AT HIS FLAT (WHICH 
DID NOT REALLY LOOK LIKE A FLAT WHEN EVERYBODY WAS FINISHED  WITH 
IT).  THANKS  ALSO  GO TO ZAE WITHOUT WHOM THE  CONVENTION  WOULD 
DEFINITELY  NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE 'CAUSE HE ORGANIZED AND  PAYED 
FOR  MOST  OF THE THINGS (THANKS A LOT & AND SEE  YOU  NEXT  YEAR 
(HOPEFULLY)).  THE  NEXT THANKS AND I THINK THE LAST ONE GOES  TO 
ALEXIS  WHO FUNCTIONED AS A DRIVER,  HE ALWAYS DROVE  US  AROUND, 
I.E. TO THE DISCO, THE BEACH, THE GIRLS AND WHEREVER WE WANTED TO 
GO,  NOT  TO FORGET MC DONALDS.   IF WE HAVE FORGOTTEN  TO  THANK 
ANYBODY, WRITE TO OUR COMPLAINTS OFFICE.

 
 MY (SAMMY JOE) SPECIAL HELLOS & THANKS FOR A GREAT TIME GO TO :
                         
   - SNAKE  ( I hope to meet you again some time in the future,

              future)

   - ALL THE GIRLS WE MET (BRIGITTE, CARINE, KATJA & HER SISTER
     ODETTE, BEATRICE, JUSTINE, STEPHANIE, ESPECIALLY INGVERNESS
     & CLAIRE. For the names of the other girls I would have to 
     ask Phil but he is in the pub at the moment, but believe me, 
     there were a lot more.
   - JOSEF (ZAE,  TELL JOSEF THAT WE GREETED HIM) How many  other 
     girls have you had/blood stains have you had/made ?
