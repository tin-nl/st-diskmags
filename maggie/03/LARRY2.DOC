gave you. AND THERE WE HAVE A WINNER! In the waiting room go over to the
bench you see on top of the screen.

Wait until a man appears through the left door and ask you to come along.
"STAND"
Follow him through the left door. During the dating connection you are asked 2
questions. It doesn't matter what you answer, as long as you answer something.
It doesn't come out right anyway !
When you have won the dating connection you are back in the green room.
You have to wait there until a woman appears through the right door. Sit down
and relax,  it takes less time that way. So walk over to the bench and

explains the plot. Then go W. You suddenly find yourself standing in front of
a building belonging in SPACE QUEST IV. (see you there real soon).

In front of the scurvy dog you will encounter an old drunk who offers
you a drink. Ignore him and go S,E. Walk over to the man behind the fence.

You are standing next to your cabin, situated on the right.
Walk to the right and enter your cabin. Walk up to the little window and
"GET FRUIT"
Turn back and open the door to the right.

Now whatever you do don't go near, or sit on the bed. When mother is finished

Time to have a little swim and do some sun bathing. Go behind the locker
in your cabin and

the way up to the restaurant. Go left into the lifeboat-deck.
Walk to the opening in the side (near to the lifeboat) and
"JUMP".
The ships stops and the lifeboats start to descend to the water.
The moment you're boat hits the water you've got to type in three things,
and you must do this before the lifeboats floats away into the next picture!
"THROW DIP OVERBOARD" ;"RUB SUNCREEN" ;"WEAR WIG" .
and now you're in for another show from Sierra On-Line: you're first (and
hopefully last) lifeboat cruise!
When you reach the island's beach you should have about 190 points.
On the beach (where noone cares for you), go S. You find yourself in a jungle.
It takes a moment for you to find an exit! Here, allmost everything is
controlled by Sierra. In this picture you see a big palm tree with a parrot
in the top and a potted plant on the leftside of the tree. On the right side
of the tree there is flower. When you walk past it type
"GET FLOWER".
If you mis it, don't worry, you will walk in this frame more than once!
When you find an exit, it happens to be a restaurant. Walk over to the man on
"TALK MAN".
Go over to the chair and

occupied). Then Sierra wil guide you in the restaurant.

to find the beach again. Walk W and go to the rocks.  There's a bikini top
(where has the girl gone to???) lying around.
"GET BIKINI".
The go back in the jungle (E,S).
Again the first exit you find (this time more quickly) is the restaurant.  But
you have no more bussiness there, so leave it.
Back in the jungle (you should have made a trail!).  After searching (at last)
you find an exit to you're room. Go to the window of you're room and turn
right.  Go behind the wall (so we can't see you) and slide in you're nice
little bikini.
"WEAR BIKINI"  "PUT DOUGH IN TOP".
Leave the room (again in the jungle) and when you find an exit, it so happens
to be the barber shop again. (Al Lowe shure has a thing for barbers!)
You look like a (pretty) girl now except for all that excessive body hair.
Walk over to the chair and
"SIT".
Leave the baraber shop.  Back in the jungle (this is getting tiresome) you
finally find you're beach back. It's time to leave this place, so go E,E.
Now you're on the cliffs. You have to walk along the cliffs to your rescue.
Don't bother if you fall, your elastical powers save the day. When you made
your last turn (BEFORE you see the airport!!) don't forget to
"WEAR SUIT".
Here you should have gained approxemately 254 points.
You may now safely admire the airport. Walk carefully over to those two funny
dansing guys in front of the airport doors. Don't walk to close to them
because if you do they will grab you (KGB).

The KGBishna walk away in confusion, so you can safely enter the airport.

Walk E through the gate.
You'll see a moving belt and a little window behind a sleeping man.
Walk over to the belt. When a suitcase comes by type
"GET SUITCASE"
Whenever one is in front of you. Or wait until you see a suitcase in the
x-ray window with a bomb in it.
You now find yourself in the main hall.  Go over to the counter and
"BUY TICKET".
When you finally (!) get a ticket go back to the customs officer (E) and

counter and

Now you're again in for a little show from Sierra.
When you have taken off wait until the man next to you starts talking.
"GIVE PAMPLET" "GET AIRSICK BAG" "STAND"
and walk to the back of the plane. (SMOKING departement)
Opposite to the toilet with the red light burning, there is an escape hatch.
Allthough you cannot see it, do go to it. Face the escape hatch
(that is with your back to the toilet).
"WEAR PARACHUTE" "PICK LOCK"  "PULL LEVER" "OPEN DOOR".
When you are out of the plane don't forget to
"OPEN PARACHUTE"
before you get out of this screen frame, or you'll land in the sea!
You should now have accumulated about 342 points.
When you are stuck in the trees
"CUT PARACHUTE".
Nice landing!!!!!
On the spot where you land you can see something lying on the ground
behind you. Turn around,walk over to it and
"GET STICK".
Now walk over to the bush at the bottom of the screen.
"CRAWL UNDER BUSH".
Once past the bush with the deadly killer bees go S. You're now standing at
the left top of the screen.  Walk to the lower right corner of the screen.
While you do so, you'll encounter a serpent (a snake). When the snake begins
his attack,
"USE STICK".
to defend yourself. Now go E. You are at the swamp. You can see a little monkey
there who has no problem walking over the swamp. There's only one way to cross
the swamp. Fortunately the monkey left a trail in the mud. Walk on this trail
and cross the swamp. When you have crossed the swamp you will see a river with
a rock on your side of the river with some vines hanging from the trees.
walk over to the rock and stand as close as possible to the river.
"SWING VINE"
and WHILE you're swinging and BEFORE you reach out for the next vine, again
"SWING VINE"

to the other side of the river.
Now walk to the rock at the base of the tree
"GET VINE"
Walk N-E (NorthEast).
At this time you should have gained about 385 points.
Again time for a Sierra On-Line Native Show! The player completely looses
control over Larry until the chief leads you do the secret crossing to Dr.
Nonokee's mountain. Walk back to the village, that is S,E. walk to the
fireplace.
"GET ASHES"
Walk back to the beach (S) and
"GET SAND".
Walk back to the chasm (crossing) that the chief has shown you. Walk to the
edge opposite of the big tree branch (about the middle of the chasm's width).
You must stand very close to the edge of the chasm!
"THROW VINE".
You find yourself sourrounded by ice. Go up to the bottom of the glacier and
"SPREAD ASHES".
or
"SPREAD SAND".
it makes no difference. You had to take both to gain some extra points.
Walk up from the bottom left side of the screen to the top right side.
You are now on top of the glacier. You see can elevator and a crevice with
SMOKE coming out of it. Walk over to the crevice (where the smoke comes
through). You must stand on the right hand side from the smoke, and very near
to the crevice. Now you have make you're larrytov coctail!
"PUT BAG IN TONIC"
or put the airsick bag into the hair tonic.
"USE MATCHES" "DROP BOTTLE".
While the larrytov coctail finds it way to the bottom of the glacier and
causes an explosion, the elevator doors open. Walk over to the elevator
and enter it. You should now have about 467 points.
All YOUR work is done now so, Sierra will finish the story for you.
When our beloved ones reach the beach (and the vulcano explodes) you should
have gained about 500 of the 500 points.
