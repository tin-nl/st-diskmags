Well.......

Here  we  are  again,  after phoning Sammy Joe,  "Did you  get  my 
articles for Diskmaggie 3 in time..."

"  Well  yes  I  did,  but we have no games reviews,  can  you  do 
something??!!!" said the german one...

"  Well  ok,  I'll  see what I can do (HA HA HA  HA!!!" exuant  to 
demented  shrieks  of  laughter,  the  old  brain  finally  having 
snapped...)

Which still leaves a fundamental problem that all of this is  only 
delaying  the fateful moment. Which is due about.....NOW!!!

     ********************FATEFUL MOMENT*******************

I  KNOW!!!  lets  write  some  reviews on  the  coverdisk  preview 
material  I  have built up over the summer,  a couple  of  'Golden 
Oldies'  and  a feature on which games look like  they  are  worth 
getting   that  are  due  for  release  in  the  next  couple   of 
months........

Lets  face  it,  quality releases have been a bit light  over  the 
summer period, and there has not been a lot I would personally sit 
down  to play for very long....  GREAT!!!!  thats sorted that out, 
but waddya mean I've got to write them OOOHHHH GOD!!!!!!!...

  All for the minute...lotsa luv CIH...
