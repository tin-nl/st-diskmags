Look out for.......

RPG'ers look no further than DRAGONFLIGHT,  out any time now,  2.5 
megs  worth  of highest-quality game,  of the  traditional  ULTIMA 
style  c.œ29.99  by  Thalion (absolutely nothing to  do  with  any 
favourable mention..well ok, just a little bit..)

Fans  of  more Sci-fi orientated RPG's should go  for  CORPORATION 
(Core design) which is out now on Amiga,  soon on ST,  and is more 
like a 'Dungeonmaster' type of game....

People,  like me, who prefer the 3D genre, seem to be well catered 
for,  with impending (Definition of "Impending" - anything up to 6 
months...) releases of SIMULCRA (Microstyle) a cross between VIRUS 
and  ROTOX,  XIPHOS,  an  Elite-type space game with some gorgeous 
graphics  (from the stills I've seen....) by Electronic  Zoo,  and 
EPIC (formerly Goldrunner 3D..) by Digital Image Design, who wrote 
F29  Retaliator,  so  you know its got to be good...Epic  uses  3D 
graphics tweaked and extensively improved since F29 was  released, 
and work is progressing on Retaliator 2...

For  your next megagame,  it has to be POWERMONGER,  by Electronic 
Arts (c/o Bullfrog again...) the long-awaited POPULOUS  follow-up, 
which  I  hope  does as well as it`s predecessor  (I  hope  it  is 
Christmas  no.1 and blows away the f*cking Muntant  Ninja  -sorry- 
Hero Turtles...It might just be able to do it...)

STE owners could find VAXINE by U.S.gold (Assembly Line..) a  game 
to go for.  this follow-up to E-Motion is a 3D ray-traced abstract 
shoot-em-up  which features the STE's enhanced colour  palette  and 
stereo  sound - a first for a major release on the STE..  I  might 
add  there is nothing wrong with the 'plain vanilla' STFM  version 
which still looks good as well...

Psygnosis has a ton of games as you might expect,  so just a quick 
mention  for some of them,,first off- NITRO,  a  supersprint-style 
racing  game,  with  loads  of  extras,  secondly,  SPELLBOUND,  a 
platform-jobbie  with  what  looks  like  Amiga-quality  graphics, 
thirdly,  CARTHAGE,  a Roman strategy-cum-chariot racer, also, THE 
KILLING GAME SHOW starring Leslie Crowther(???).  Finally,  SHADOW 
OF THE BEAST due soon for the ST,  bearing in mind that BEAST 2 on 
the Amiga has enhanced gameplay, as a reaction to the criticism of 
the  original,  does this mean SHADOW OF THE BEAST will be crap on 
the ST??????

UMS II,  the war-gamers wet dream, out soon...as I personally KNOW 
some  of  these sort of people (Hello John,  you know who you  are 
mate...)  Expect a full review as soon as we can get our hands  on 
this one...

BITMAPS  corner  -  CADAVER,  aka  Ultimate reborn,  a  very  nice 
isometric arcade adventure, and SPEEDBALL 2 (coming whenever...)

DON'T  TOUCH WITH A BARGEPOLE,  NOT EVEN WITH A STERILE  BARGEPOLE 
dept......

ANY  licence games,  especially coming up to the Christmas period, 
ESPECIALLY  connected with 'Turtles' you know which ones  I  mean, 
leave  these  to people with more money than sense,  I  even  hear 
rumours of a game concerning a well known 'Australian' soap  opera 
(FUCKING  BEAM ME UP OUT OF HERE SCOTTY!!!!!) if true this  is  an 
unparallelled catastrope (SOUNDS OF COPIOUS VOMITING.....)

I  think that's all I can cope with for the minute,  see you  next 
issue...
