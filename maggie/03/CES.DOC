                    IN LONDON ATTENDED BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

     The CES (short for Computer Entertainment Show) is the first 
of its kind.  Some people say that it is the 'new' PCW Show ! But 
I would not say so.  This show,  as the name already  says,  only 
deals  with computer entertainment.  This years CES  was  nothing 
like  the  PCW  Show  at all as  there  were  far  more  Business 
Companies and Hardware Shops attending the last PCW show. 

     The CES was therefore only visited by game companies,  a few 
hardware shops and the odd PD library for the ST/Amiga.   Talking 
about  different computers,  I think that I should  mention  that 
Amstrad  also  had a stand there showing off their  machines  and 
some of their other products. BUT as this is a ST disk magazine I 
should rather talk about the ST scene at the show.  All the major 
English   game  companies  came  with  a  few   exceptions   from 
Switzerland and other places in Europe. 
 
     Now  starting with the major English companies I  will  tell 
you  about there stands,  their new releases and whatever else  I 
think you might want to know! 

MPH:
A company not many people have heard of before. They have finally 
managed to release their first product,  and what a HIT !!  It is 
the TCB Soundtracker,  4 channel tunes,  include them in your own 
programs,  pitch  bending,  great editing and whatever  else  you 
could ask for when editing your musix.  One of the best,  if  not 
THE BEST, music program on the Atari ST. This program brings your 
ST close to the Amiga's quality!
 
US GOLD:
The  company I have decided to start with is US Gold as they  are 
probably one of the two companies who produce the most games, not 
just  on  the ST,  I am not saying that quantity is  better  than 
quality !! US Gold actually has some great games in the pipeline, 
the  most promising game I have seen of their's  is  VAXINE.  The 
whole  game  takes  part in your body,  a new  deadly  virus  has 
evoked,  your  only chance of survival is VAXINE.  Vaxine  is  an 
antibody capable of putting up a fight against the new virus. You 
can attack the invaders with colour coded antibodies. As the game 
progresses  the  virus  invasion force  will  grow  stronger  and 
stronger.  And  now some more technical details on the  game.  It 
uses  100%  ray-traced graphics,  more than  100-colours  on  the 
screen  at  the  same time b y  using  interrupts  and  dithering 
techniques. 
Other games that will be released by US Gold are for example: The 
Secret of Morkey Island  (an adventure type game which is due  in 
1991),  The  Secret  Weapons of the Luftwaffe  (a  flight  combat 
simulator  due in 1991),  U.N.  Squadron (another  fighter  plane 
simulator  due now !!),   Operation Harrier,  Strider II  (rescue 
your  woman !!  And have some fun !).  US Gold is releasing  many 
more  games in the future,  if you want more information on  them 
simply write to US GOLD.

OCEAN:
Ocean's X-Mas range consists of about 14 different  titles,  some 
of which I will now explain to you. 
Robocop 2 - The manuals for this game (as all the others) will be 
            printed  in all the three major languages in  Europe, 
            that  is French,  German and of course  English.  The 
            game  consists  of  8  levels,  80  multi-directional 
            scrolling  screens,  there  are 4  different  hi-tech 
            weapons, the sprites and the graphics in general will 
            be bigger. Release Date : End of November
Total Recall - Kill,  kill and kill again,  this is the theme  of 
               the game.  You task is to travel to Mars where you 
               then will be confronted by Aliens etc..,  the game 
               has  5 levels,  various digitised  sound  extracts 
               from the film and many more things. 
               Release Date: End of October
Nightbreed -  Sanctuary  among  the living  dead  becomes  your 
              bizarre destiny,  you have to  defend your  haven
              against  this evil;   an interactive   movie  &  
              an  action  game  in   one, there   are  30  
              different  typed   of monsters for you to kill and
               many more things, release date: mid October
Battle Command - a game I am personally looking forward to as  it 
                 is from the same guys who coded carrier command,
                 solid 3D graphics, realistic landscapes etc....
                 Due in early October. 

This  were only a few more detailed reviews of some of the  games 
due from Ocean, the others which you can look forward to are:
Chase HQ II,  Navy S.E.A.L.S.,  NARC,  Billy the Kid, Epic, Toki, 
Plotting, Pang and Puzznic. 
Most of these games do sound rather good.

GREMLIN:
This  company  has not been as busy on the ST scene  as  the  two 
above as there are only 3 games coming until the end of the year, 
but now let's have a closer look at them:
Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge: The  car your driving accelerates 
               to 60 mph in just 4.7 s,  the graphics consists of 
               an extremely fast and smooth split 3D view of  two 
               Lotus'.  The  game  has a total  of  32  different 
               tracks  in  which you can race (if  you  are  good 
               enough).  When the game is finished (some time  in 
               October) it will cost around œ24.99.
Celica GT4 Rally: The  basic  idea of the game is to test your  
               driving  skills in various courses and in  a  wide 
               variety of climatic conditions.  This game is  due 
               in November and will cost around œ24.99.
Team Suzuki First Again:  A bike simulation, the game has, (as
               Gremlin claims),  the fastest and smoothest filled 
               vector  scrolling as yet seen,  the game alos  has 
               hills,  tunnels and stands,  all in all,  I  think 
               that  this here is probably the game to  look  out 
               for  from the Gremlin range.  The game is  due  in 
               December and will cost the usual.

MIRRORSOFT:
Probably one of the biggest runner up in the future, it is:
The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: Your  task  is  to rescue the
                 lovely  April O'Neil who has  been  captured  by 
               Shredder.  On  your  rescue mission  you  will  be 
               confronted  by Mouser  infested  sewers,  polluted 
               rivers and many other obstructions. Can you rescue 
               April  ?  This  game  is  due  for  the  Atari  in 
               November.
Speedball 2:   Another major project, the same programmer, what
                can   go wrong ?  As usual the game will  feature 
               the   amazing  coin-up  quality   graphics   which 
               characterises all Bitmap Brothers cooperations. By 
               the looks of it,  this game will be another  major 
               hit. Due in Autumn.
Back to the Future III: Marty  is further back in time, caught in 
               a web of intrigue and romance and his DeLorean  is 
               out  of gas !  Shoot the cowboys but how  are  you 
               going to get back to your "real time" ?
Mirrorsoft  are realising more games like:  Predator  2,  Duster, 
Cadaver, Omnicron Conspiracy, Flip-it and Magnose, Blade Warrior, 
Champion of the RAJ,  Reach for the Skies,  The Final Battle, Red 
Phoenix rises for Pss,  Riders of Rohan,  Wings,  It came for the 
desert and least but not last The Flight of the Intruder.


Well this is it now for all the game releases here in the UK, the 
next  show which is worth looking out for is probably  the  Atari 
Computer Shopper Show some time around X-Mas.
