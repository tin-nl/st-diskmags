NEOCHROME II
------------

I suppose everyone interested in painting (amongst the ST-
users, of course) knows either Degas Elite or Neochrome. Now 
there's Neochrome II, and the burning question is:

Is it better than Degas?

Well, I heard from a lot of people who even find Neochrome One 
better, but myself, I always prefered Degas. Neochrome II now hasn't 
got any basic changes, but offers few very nice improvements. So 
if you liked the first one, you certainly won't find this one worse. 
Now to the new features:

You can set rasters at will, which will allow pictures of the 
quality of a Magnetic Scrolls titlepic, provided you've got both 
skill and time (lots of, I mean).

The animation tool is completed and working (in Neo one it was 
well hidden and easily crashing the computer). It's quite good in 
my opinion, easy to use and offering all you need. Not as good as 
the STOS animation tool though, but miles ahead of the screen-
switching Degas has to offer.

You have four screens now, but interaction between them is quite 
complicated (you can toggle by the ()/* keys, but until now I 
haven't found a screencopy function).

Loading and saving is possible in Degas, Neochrome, Doodle and 
IFF-format (packed and unpacked). Too, you can (still) save 
anything valuable in binary information, making it easier for a 
programmer to handle.

In version 2.1, you also have a small zoom-window in the border 
if you are working on the whole picture.

And now let's talk about the features Degas has to offer and 
Neochrome hasn't (yet?):

Ten zoom-levels are very handy sometimes, although all you can do 
is hand-drawing. Too, the Neochrome-zoomer seperates the pixels 
by a black line, which makes it quite hard to distinguish similar 
colours. And after all, Degas offers nearly a full screen for the 
zoomed pic. Once you're used to this, you don't want to miss it.

Lines are drawn by clicking at beginnign and end (the same goes for 
frames and circles too, of course), while in Neochrome you have 
to keep the button pressed, which makes it harder to work 
precisely.

All options are found on one single screen rather than the half-
a-dozen of subscreens you have in Neo.

There's a lot of drawing features, such as change colour, use 
pattern or the mirror.

All is written down, making it much less confusing. I prefer 
clicking on the word "disc" if I want to paint a disc, while 
first having to click on an icon representing "Polygon", followed 
by clicking on a disc (and checking whether the border is at my 
will) is a bit circumstantial to me.

Coming to an end, I would say that users of Neochrome one should 
get it anyway, and for Degas-users it's still a nice tool and 
offering a few very useful functions.

P.S.:
DPaint is just converted to the ST, and at the Atari-Messe in 
Dusseldorf there already was a running version, although 
suffering from frequent part-crashes (a bit annoying, but no 
danger to your work). It looks as if there were a lot of features 
(animation included), but I'm not so sure it's going to be as 
good as on the Amiga (nasty word, I know, but unavoidable).
