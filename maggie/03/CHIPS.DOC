This one may be the last, as The Skunk will want his Lynx back
soon, unless someone will give me the œ65 I need to get one!

Chips Challenge
---------------

       At first glance this game looks really crap, the first 
time I played it I thought "this is a pile of festering shit",
but if you actually play the game for a while, it becomes 
totally addictive.

       The aim of the game is for Nerdy Chip (that's you, poor 
son of a bitch, fancy having a name like that) to collect all 
the chips on each level within a time limit. This on it's own 
would be quite simple, so you also have to collect coloured
keys to unlock the various doors in the maze.

       As the levels progress, more and more weird and 
wonderful things are added to the maze. Iced areas, fires, 
bombs, water, boxes, gravel, the list is endless. The three 
main additions (and hazards) to the levels are water, fire, and 
ice. Crossing them unaided is impossible, so various shields 
have to be picked up to protect you. The levels are all mainly 
logic based puzzles (you know the sort of thing, 
stand-on-the-button-to-open-the-door-to-get-to-get-key sort of 
thing) but some levels are races against time.

       Music in the game is varied and on the whole not too bad,
but you can turn the sound off anyhow. The sound FX are 
passable but not particularly good.

       The games graphics are quite small but reasonably well 
defined. The use of colour in the characters is good, but is 
let down by the blandness of the grey coloured background 
graphics.
       
GRAPHICS               :       60%
SOUND                  :       55%
PLAYABILITY            :       82%
VALUE FOR MONEY        :       70%
OVERALL                :       65%

       If you like logic puzzles then you'll enjoy this game, 
however if your idea of fun is blasting the hell out of aliens, 
the steer well clear of this game.

P.S. Thanks to Alistair Craig for lending me his LYNX and all 
the games, also thanks for getting me and Chris our 
LYNX's/LYNXes*

* Delete where incorrect. (Chris says "LYNXes is the plural of 
LYNX" coz he's brainy.)
