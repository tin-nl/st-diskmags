
Part II from this great Convention:

-- Hi !! -- Okey , after a long night while I didn't sleep , here 
is MIT
from NeXT ,  I think I'm the first french who come here and write 
some ,  heu ..... , Okey but now I understand the reason what for 
I'm the first french bullshiter .... Yes we are typing on English 
st  keyboard ,  you know :QWERTY ,  bah why did they not  took  a 
french st's keyboard ???? we don't know .... Okey I think
, iI will go on swiming pool , ZAE is not here , he was gone last 
night on disco with a friend and he's not here yet !! Has he meet  
a beautiful girl ??? no , I think he would phone me immediatly .
 my english so bad , don't you think , so I excuse me for all the 
felher I wrote !! so bye and see you later .....

TNS  here.  Did  you ever work with  an  AZERTY  keyboard?  Total 
horror!  No normal person could in his normal state of his normal 
mind  even let his brain-cells have the merest spark of  an  idea 
that the possibility that maybe an AZERTY-keyboard might be  used 
for  even the most trivial of tasks (like typing your name  on  a 
label).
Now this text will have to be removed from this computer, because 
I  am going to draw some sprites for the  copy-party  demo.  Nice 
'uns I hope.

Time: too late (8 pm on the Sunday) (Samantha Joe Fox)
Herewith  we apologize that we have not been writing for so  long 
but  we had better things to like chatting up nice girls on  some 
raft in the water.  Well first of all we tried to play volleyball 
but  gave  up 'cause of the heat.  We then decided to go  to  the 
beach or as the French would say " La plage 3. The worst memory I 
have  from  this afternoon is that I first of all  had  to  drive 
around with Phil of BBC (who hasn't even got the driving  license 
with  him).  When  I was driving with him I thought that  it  was 
dangerous,  BUT  still acceptable (I think that I should say  for 
his  credit that he stayed on the right side of the road for  all 
the time (at least that is what he tells me, I can't tell because 
I    kept   my   eyes   shut   throughout   the    whole    drive 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)). Finally on the beach we relaxed and then went 
for a swim.  The weather was exactly  what you expect from a  day 
in Marseille,  bloody hot, no clouds etc... We then went swimming 
and  swum to a raft floating in the sea (where else ?).  AXE  got 
pushed from the raft and had his nose kicked in so that it  began 
to bleed.  Later on, on the raft we tried to find the best way to 
chat  up a non-English-German-Dutch speaking girl.  Here are  the 
best methods (no guarantee):

1) Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ?
2) Voulez-vous sortir avec moi ce soir ?
3) Vous avez des 'big tits' (this did not quite work as they  did    
not understand what 'tits' means)    
In the end each of us had two lovely girls on each side,  not bad 
eeh  ?  (Just  joking,  each  of  us  had  three  on  each  side! 
zrfytjuolu…,rejzdybbni);  (sorry  about  that but  Chrises  brain 
suddenly began to work !!!!!).

I think that that covers about most of the events today.  By  the 
way, Axe is currently working on a new version of his Fire Packer 
(which will probably be included in this issue !!!!!).

                         See you later, S.J.

Time: 20:24

Keyboard: AZERTY (shit!)

Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  am proud to bring  to  you  the  very 
interesting discussion of 'The Pros and Cons of SeaWater'.
First of all, I will begin with the bad sides of this substance:

1- It is cold most of the time,  although at the last  researched 
site,  the Mediterranee, I concluded that here is the exeption to 
the rule.
2-  In  contrast to normal  water,  it  contains  Natrium-Cloride 
(NaCl) which brings a particularly nasty taste to your mouth.
3- and finally, according to a reliable source, IT IS WET!

But  what would a real discussion be without  contrasting  points 
that come to the aid of the sea-water:

Well, that were the positive points.

Concluding from this information:  it is best said that  normally 
sea-water should be avoided,  but sometimes, when unavoidable, or 
when pleasantly warm,  it might be entered.  BUT be warned: doing 
thus is totally at the risk of you.

                              Have Fun, TNS.


Time: 20:56

Hello folks! I am sure you never heard of 'MYSTIC', our group.
Consequently,  I will introduce us to you.  We live in France, in 
Toulouse to be more precise. At the moment Mystic only is
composed of two members:  LTK (coder) and Mr SPIRIT  (coder).  We 
are  desperately  searching for a graphist to help  us  as  since 
Goethe there were no more universal geniusses and one can hardly
be a good coder and a good graphist at the same time, i.e. we at
least aren't.
You  will certainly wonder:  "But why are they at this  fantastic 
convention?"  It all began with a simple letter.  I proposed  the 
Replicants to make an interview of their group and its members. I 
still do not know why they accepted, but at least we are here!!
When we arrived,  we met The REPLICANTS, their friends, the other 
groups  present  and we found they are  very  nice.  Between  the 
swimming pool and the sea there is not much time left for  coding 
but we hope that you can soon see a demo from MYSTIC.

                              Mr SPIRIT and LTK.

Kowabunga!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Packing well did you say???) This is Fury 
and Filon (of THG,  my first group) and The NUTTY Snake.  I'm  on 
the  keyboard while the others are sitted to my right and  to  my 
left  (then,  I  only have two  sides!!!!!  What  an  interesting 
statement!!!!!  (Pack!  Pack!  Let's Pack!!!!!).  Well,  what  to 
say??? Hmm, oh, I remember having seen a little while before that 
Aenigmatica dudes were counting their grey hairs.  Well,  if they 
think of having 5847 grey hairs (How did I remember that??? Well, 
here's  a usefull cheat,  you can use arrow keys to  read  what's 
been written before),  I'm sure to be granted with,  at least,  a 
zillion more at the end of my life (If I didn't rip them all  out 
before  the end of this convention!!!).  Filon just told me  that 
Ratboy wanted to buy an ST again (Hope to see you soon!!!), great 
thing!!!). Well, hey! Wait a minute, what's TNS doing??? He's got 
his  finger pointed out and makes strange moves in the air  while 
humming like that:  bziiiiii!!!!!!!!!!  (Packing  time!!!).  Now, 
......;  (Heh,  heh!  this  is TNS interrupting Fury while he  is 
explaining  something  to  Crush & ZoKathRa.  I  just  wanted  to 
explain my strange behavior Fury described:  Out of the joystick-
port  from this 1040 ST,  there emerges a black cable,  which  is 
connected to a plug,  from which two wires (one white, one green) 
emerge,  which  in turn connect to a strange device plugged  into 
the printer-port at the back.  From this device,  which  features 
resistors,  capcitors and lots of messy soldering, sprouts a wire 
which runs almost 3.5 metres long, ending in a big audio plug, on 
which  a  large- to small stereo-plug converter  is  shoved...... 
strange.  Oops,  Fury' back.....). Fury's back, and Derek MD just 
told me that if you want to drink a bear (oups!!!!  It's a  beer) 
at  the  Mc Donalds,  you MUST buy an  hamburger.  As  Derek  had 
allready eaten, he had to eat 3 more hamburgers in order to drink 
his  3 beers (Hope he didn't make as much mess at the Mc  Donalds 
as  he did in my kitchen!!!!!!!!!  Elsehow,  we'll have  to  find 
another Mc Donalds!!!  I'll have to switch on to the  information 
channel to see if they report of a rampaging Derek in  Marseille, 
looking for a way to get totally pissed....  (HAR,  TNS...). It's 
strange,  beefsteaks (Fury's version of English people!) seem  to 
need  pissed  state to live.  It must have something to  do  with 
their  strange  habit  to eat mint jello  with  their  meat!!!)). 
Dinner time!!!  The expedition to Mc Donalds just came  in,  I've 
got  to get my food...  See ya later...  Fury signing  off  (Grey 
hairs!!! Grey hairs!!!)

No!  I'm not gone!  ST Wars just told me that what I was thinking 
of Derek in a Mc Donalds in search of beer,  was TRUE!!! The Fate 
is a lamer!!! He doesn't know the game: Block Out!!!

Hi  there  loyal  reader,you  have  survived  until  the  serious 
stuff,the  text by me,Andy the Arfling!  Well I've just read  the 
bit  above and I can tell you after being really pissed off  with 
MacDonalds  we started a food fight in the shop,ending in all  of 
us  knocking  chairs flying in an attempt to leg it  out  of  the 
shop.

Anyway,on  to my sad condition,let me tell you that the South  of 
France is fucking hot!  I lost my sun cream and now I'm burnt all 
over,my legs,back,neck,aaaarrrrggggghhhhh!!!!!!!! Hell!!!!!!
But  worse than that,much worse,I'm having to type on  a  fucking 
French  shitty keyboard,I hate it,why can't they put the keys  in 
the right place?  I can't stand any more,laters......

This is Axe now at the keyboard!
Together with Derek I just read the previous lines.  What are you 
saying about me,  guys? You call THIS rampaging? Then you haven't 
met me when I was drunk!!!!!!!
After checking the article, we found that Derek is mentioned most 
often (24 times so far).  That means that "Derek" will pack  very 
well,  so (you might have guessed it...):  Derek,  Derek,  Derek, 
Derek, Derek, Derek, Derek, Derek!
      Message for lamers:  The repeating of "Derek" will be  very       
good  for  packing,  so  every time I write  it,  the  length  of       
the packed text will become shorter!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      So if you find "Derek, Derek, Derek,..." at the end of this       
text, then this is only to make this text fit on the disk!


Time : 10:16, Monday (European Standard, so it's early!)


As Sammy Joe is still sleeping, and I've got no idea where his 
realtime article disk is, this piece of the text is written on 
another textprocessor, and I'll try to import it into the big 
article. So if the time seems a little out of place, someone else
wrote after me, but I couldn't include this part in time, so.....
ah forget it. I just wanted top report on one of the main problems
(again?) here: DRINK. And no, I don't mean alcoholic beverages, 
but just plain, cool, thrist-defying, refreshing drinks. The water
contains all sorts of micro-organsims which we northerners (from 
Holland, England, Germany, etc.) aren't protected against, and I 
just wash out my mouth with water to remove the salty taste of 
Cheese-and Hamburgers. Well, more and more people start waking, 
and so the speaking volume slowly increases. Sammy Joe will be, 
at least a bit, pleased, because he has now slept for about 5 1/2
hours, and he is still snoring blissfully. Lying next to him is 
the challenge of this morning: AXE from Delight. He challenged us
last night that we couldn't wake him within 3 minutes (or something
like that.... If I remember well). But last night, we discovered 
THE perfect waking method.... Aaaah, you want to know do you! No, 
no. But if you get woke by it, you will recognise it. Oh yes you 
will. OH YES YOU WILL!! More serious things now: The never answered
question 'What are french people good at, if they are good at 
anything?'. The answer to the last part is sadly Yes, they are good
at some things, but not the things you and I would think about. 
Following long-term, involuntary research, I came to the conclusion
that the one thing french adeolesants (how DO you write this word?) 
are good at is......

NEWSFLASH!!!: Sammy Joe has just been shot awake by Zae (or was it
Snake? I can't seem to remember who is who with those french guys),
and AXE has been too! Casualties: 2 awake persons and about 10 
laughing frenchmen. 

burping. Boy are they good at it! not the short voilent ones, but
the Loooonnngg HARD burps that seem to come from their toes, and 
stretch straight to the ceiling..... I just remembered: There is 
one other thing they seem to enjoy doing, and with visible result:
it looks like a game, where they run to the nearest lanter-post, 
shak it violently, and after about 10-20 shakes, it goes out! 
Broken! Nice people these froggies. Now I know why they are called
this; They're HOPPING mad!

One thing I will get from this party, except from the tan, and the 
software, is some really strong muscles. I don't know why, but they
are aching all over, and that must be because they're growing (what
else?). I just heard from S.J. that this will be the second part of
the article, and that this seperate part will be the beginning. 
Strange, as the first part was written with WordPlus (was it?) and
this is being typed in with TEMPUS. Two structurally different 
programs I thought.

I think I'll keep on writing some more, and it will be somewhat 
nicer to french persons, because the two behind me (are they gone
yet?) are asking if I wrote the statement a few lines above. (I 
did, but they don't know that yet.... OUCH.... they do now.). Of
course there are some really great things about this party: The 
weather, the bags of McDonalds Cheese-
 
and Hamburgers that appeared in the kitchen out of nowhere (I had
2 hamburgers and 3 cheesburgers one of which was cold. Nice!).

Have you guessed yet who is the author of the last 3.5k of text?
No? Well, keep on reading then. Maybe I'll give you some hints 
later. (or you could scroll on to the end of this part and look
at my name. But that would be cheating, and we don't do that do
we?)

'Is it a bird?...... NOOOO!'
'Is it a plane? .... YES!'
'Oh... ah well..... (shit!)'

END OF CLUE 1.

I was asked by S.J. to write an article for Maggie, so if you 
see my name (whoever I am) under it, you know you'll have value
for your money, or else my name isn't......... Ahh, almost got me 
there. But I am awake at all times (except when I'm sleeping, 
then I'm only awake at the odd hours.), and to catch me off-guard
is almost impossible. But you may be in luck, because the end of 
my current inspiration is nigh, and that means that the end of 
this part is going to be here soon. As a matter of fact, here it
is:

                                       Gotcha, The Nutty Snake.


Hi!!! This is a tired Fury typing on this f.....g QWERTYUIOP 
keyboard. I just got up tem minutes ago after a long night of 
border adaptation for this stinky STE shifter, MMu, Glue, Roms,
Rams, 68000, MFP 68901, YM2149, DMA Sound, and all other co-
processors that are supposed to help the programmer (What a big 
JOKE!!! Each time Atari releases a new ST version, we (Coders) 
have to recalculate and piss our brains in order to make all 
old border routs work with either the old machines and the latest
version out. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! 
(This word might appear often enough to shorten the size of this 
file when packing, but, of course, the greatest packed shortener 
still is...................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(Somehow, I think that Derek comes close to it anyway!!!))

                        Ok, this was O-O-S-F at the keyboard...
                        (Out-Of-Sleep-Fury!!!)

Time: 11:20.

Good morning people, this is Crush who just woke up and who is 
still a bit sleepy. I think Fury put the word 'Fuck!' on one of 
the F-keys. Let's try it out... 'move.l' no, it's not F1. 'DIR' 
That's F2. 'Hello, I'm Fury, and I'm a froggie!' - Wow, 
interesting F3, Keep that one Fury! '

INTERRUPTION #7

Do you know the definiton of RECURSIVE?
No??

RECURSIVE: see RECURSIVE.

End of interruption #7.

F4: 'I'd like some cola now'. Hmmm they keep on getting stranger. 
'And now for something completely different', that's F5, while F6 
seems to be something like 'I hate F-keys' (???) and F7 reads 'So
long and thanks for all the fish'. F8 is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw
xyz' and F9 is, strangely enough, empty and the last, F10, reads 
'Are you having fun reading all the F-keys?'. Well what a load of
fun. The Nutty Snake is standing behind me and he is wearing an 
..... APPLE COMPUTERS t-shirt (what, a spy in our ranks, we should
get rid of him fast). By the way, while we were on the beach 
yesterday I acquired a nasty sunburn.

INTERRUPTION #8.

The guy who was coming to repair Fury's washing machine just did 
so in about 1 minute, so Fury can wash all his clothes for the 
first time since aeons.

End of interruption #8.

Fury here: I want to send a Mega Greet to guy who repaired my 
washing machine. He saves my life!!! It was begining to be hard to
get clean clothes each day...(Do you do any washing then?, ED)
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MY SUNBURN, NOT ABOUT WASHING MACHINES! Well,
I didn't sleep too good, because of my sunburn so if you see any 
spelling mistakes it's due to my lack of sleep, and because of all
this I think I'll stay in today. Well on my left-side of me, someone
is programming on my ST, on my right-side someone is playing with 
a joystick that has the distinct features of some kind of dildo so 
you can see there's a lot going in Fury's home. Yesterday four guys
were playing MIDI-MAZE with four ST's and if you ever get the 
chance of playing with 2 players or more you should do it, it's big
fun. Now I'm gonna hunt for some food so bye bye boys and girls.

TIME: almost 12:00

TNS here. Let me just report on the situation here:

LOCATION: Fury's House
SPECIFIC LOCATION: A table in the main room, close to the OPEN 
window.
VIEW FROM THE WINDOW: A swimming pool containing, besides lotsof
water, a few nice-looking female-swimmers, some of them, eh, 
'Oben Ohne'.
NUMBER OF FEMALES HERE: 0
NUMBER OF MALES CURENTLY HERE: 13+
DEMO PLAYING: Back To the Future.
INSPIRATION: Equal to the number of females (qv)
DRINKS HAD TODAY: Equal to the inspiration-level (qv) (including 
alcoholic, and non alcoholic beverages)
END OF SEGMENT: now.


Time: a bit past 12:00(am)

Okey , after the lunch we decided to play some volley-ball
the team were me (mit of NeXT),zae(bad guy(really a bad guy)),axe 
and fury against snake,a member of Paradox,michael or perceval(a
lamer...(you  say it  because you lose).),Mr spirit(another
lamer....) and ... and they winns.... but with luck , the score
was 15 for them and 14 for us.... but next time we will winn.
 Do you know what is 'big lamer' ??? Just look zae and you will
understand , zae is a guy who dream always , just hear that , we
were sherching (look at my good english !!!) an idea for the
demo competition , and so he give to us some idea like that :
 He want to do a game with no good anims , no good nusic , and
no border , in fact he want a demo like the intro of 'OPERATION
STEALTH' with 1 anims , and he tought we will win the competition
with that !!! ouarf ouarf , what a poor lamer .....(JOKE).
 Oh some bad guys are asking all crews here for making a demo
for a mega-demo with ZUUL,FALLEN ANGELS,NAOS(lamer),and some 
other crew ....(ndlr of perceval:bad guy,me!!!!)

 Oh god , I'm ona french keyboard , but I'm typing with TEMPUS2
which work with the shiting english keyboard , so I must shearch
all letters for 10 or 15 seconds !! I'm not lucky !! 
 Oh , this night , I've adapted the full-
screen of my 'shadow of the
best' demo to ste and now that zork every where !! Ok Have a nice 
day !! and see you later ..... 
 PS. this morning we see two beautiful girls one blond and one
 other with dark hair , ohoh and we were two too !!! but we were
on the balcony , so with my friend , we run in the lift and go down
but to late , the bus which the girls were waiting for was come ,and
they gone away.... But I'm from NeXT(bbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeerrrrrrkkkkkk
) (what's the relation??) , so
we decided to run after the bus , but we had forgotten that we were
in drawers.....Imagine the scene........ fortunately for us , 
everybody were sleeping (it was on 7.00 am) so nobody knew that
 ......    so see you later..........

Time : 22:20 (or close to that)

Fury is singing 'I wanna have turbo-
assembler' and CIA rushes out to copy 
it for him. Fury seems happy now and (fortunately) stopped 
singing (phew). Now he's telling me that out of the 25 bottles of
Coca Cola we bought this morning, only 3 remain (I drunk only one
...) and he's wondering what happened to them. I'm out for 
inspiration at the moment so let me tell you a joke that a friend
of mine (Hi, Lord Chaos) thought up.  What programs demo's and is
lying in hospital?????               An intensive care-bear. 
Well, Crush signing off now, leaving the keyboard for someone 
else to ravage.


Time: 00:50 (EN)

And now,  an eyewitness report from the main event of today:  The 
mad evening of Monday the 23rd of July.

Attending this extravaganza were:

- Tracer (Driver) [Aenigmatica]
- Zanac (Driver) [Aenigmatica]
- Sammy Joe [The Lust Boy]
- Filon [THG]
- ZoKathRa [Aenigmatica]
- MOB 
- Phil the Pilot [Childrens Television]
- Dork MD (Sorry, but I was forced) 
- AXE [Delight]
- The Nutty Snake [The Quartermass Experiment]

An Introduction:  This evening,  Monday the 23rd of July,  Tracer 
had  the  'brilliant'  idea to go to  the  Virgin  Mega-store  in 
Marseille, and look around a bit. Well, it turned out to be a lot
of fun, but not all (or almost none) of it at the Mega-Store.....

One  of the things we left the Mega-Store with was a  dry  mouth, 
so  we tried to find a bar.  But inevetably we landed at a  fast-
food  restaurant  (but not McDonalds this  time!  It  was  called 
something  like FreeTime) where Derek tried to get some beer  but 
(strangely enough?) got rejected.  What they did serve was one of 
the most strange burgers you'll ever see:  Called a LongBurger,it 
was about 20 centimetres long,  with fresh union-rings, salad and 
tomatoes.  Also,  the  girl behind the counter was very nice  (oh 
what a surprise) to look at.
To  quench  the real thirst,  Filon,  who was the  one  with  the 
knowledge of Marseille, directed us to a bar, where the (belgian) 
beer costs 13 Francs (1 Pound 30 pence, 4 Gulden, 5 Gold Pieces) 
per 0.25 litre.  On the way back, we encountered many interesting 
people: one (surprise, surprise) NOT very nice looking woman, who 
undoubtedly  had other plans for the evening,  because  when  AXE 
tried to 'make contact' with her, she quickly fled into a passing 
car.  This was a pity,  because Derek already had the 150  Francs 
out  of his wallet to pay her,  which would do more than the  100 
needed for a simple blow-job.  Finally back at the cars,  AXE got 
so desperate,  he fled into the nearest house with loud music and 
women  (followed  by Derek and MOB,  of course)  and  almost  got 
beaten out again. To get home quickly, we burned some rubber, and 
rammed some sidewalks,  finally to miss the junction,  where  the 
fastest  car had to drive on.  We (Zanac,  Zokathra,  Sammy  Joe, 
Filon and TNS) then had the brilliant idea to have a ride in  the 
'botsautotjes' (Boxautos). We managed to ram loads of nice girls, 
who afterwards seemed to look only at Sammy Joe!  (how strange!). 
Luckily  the stand where they sold beer stood next to  the  cars, 
and  while  we were drinking those,  we walked around  the  beach 
some,  where the number of topless, nice-looking girls had shrunk 
to 'only' 3.  (Nice one,  at 3 o' clock, Sammy!). Well, we walked 
around a bit more, and drove back home afterwards.

We will now continue with our second excursion of that evening at 
about  1 o' clock.  As usual we drove to the all so famous  beach 
where the Amiga guy began to throw fire-crackers around.  We then 
started  another  competition:Shake the lamp man as hard  as  you 
can.  Everybody then began to run around and shake as many  lamps 
as  possible.  After about 10 minutes there where no  more  lamps 
alight anywhere within one kilometre.  Suddenly some guy  started 
running  after us shouting "Stop !  You can't ruin all my  lovely 
little  darling lamps." But as usual we managed to get  away.  We 
then went to the fair where Derek and AXE were challenged by some 
ugly  looking  guys  (one  of them  had  a  weird  nose!!!)  from  
Marseille.   We   lost   (I   always  knew  that   Derek   is   a 
wimp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (exclamation marks pack good) !!!!!!!!!!!!     

At about 2.30am we returned home. 

By  the  way,  in  the  meanwhile  DOM,  Maxi  and   Elwood  have

And, at last: Tracer on the AZERTY keyboard. I really prefer MIDI 
keyboards  to  express myself !  As I am one of  the  Aenigmatica 
drivers,  I have to explain the driving-situation in  France.  In 
one word:  TERRIBLE.  France is surely the country with the  most 
bumped  cars.  Last night,  after going to the Virgin  Megastore, 
Zanac and I were having a race.  Axe was really afraid,  but  MOB 
liked it very much.  As the other car already said,  they  missed 
the junction, and Tracer's car won !!!

A lot of people at this convention see it more as a vacation then 
a copyparty,  and I like that. A lot of groups are also coming to 
the  'PCW-show' in September (I don't know the new  name).  I  am 
going also. I just love to see Derek's house !

Ok, that's all from me ! Hi !

Hi this is Gunstick and Fury on the keyboard.  I'm really looking 
forward to the demo competition. I'll try to do a fullscreen with 
The Fate. I've to leave now, so I hand over to Fury...
