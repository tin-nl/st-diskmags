                              by Michael Schuessler

Hello  and  welcome to another article of this  futuristic  part. 
There  are  many demos missing which have been mentioned  in  the 
last issue but not in this one, this does not mean that they have 
been released. 

THE ULM MEGADEMO
This  is the demo I am definitely looking forward to as  it  will 
contain  some,  if not THE fanciest fullscreens ever coded on  an 
ST. This demo might even have a guest screen by the Lost Boys and 
probably by some others ! 


GREAT TOXIC COOPERATION MEGA DEMO
This  is a vopy party demo which is  already long overdue  !  The 
demo will have about 7 screens ! 


MEGABLAST DEMO organized by Mad Vision
This  demo  looks also very very nice.  It will have  many  guest 
screens by groups/people like : TGE, BMt, Fashion and quite a few 
others.


A copy party in Germany:
As usual this copy party demo is late again!  BUT I know for sure 
that OXYGENE of TLB has written a marvellous screen for it  which 
is said to be his best ever. 


ALF DEMO II By LEM & NICK
This  is the second ALF demo.  From what I have heard so  far  it 
looks quite good ! This issue contains a preview screen from this 
upcoming demo. 


A  NEW  LOST BOYS MEGA DEMO (Hitchhiker Demo  or  something  like 
that):
This is the also so long overdue Lost Boys mega demo.  Due to the 
work the Lost Boys are spening on their game at the moment it has 
been  delayed for rather some time,  the release date is now  set 
for Easter 1991 (come on, in is not that long off). 



                            "ON THE LOOKOUT"

"JOURNEY INTO SOUND DEMO" (Author: Carbonne 14 from AXIOM)
This demo by the french group AXIOM has already been presented in the
last issue. I've received it but it crashes... But as we know Axiom
we have seen some preview screens like the ChipSector (a screen with a
slideshow of 160*100 pixs pics, you can select among 27 muzaks and there
is an equalizer), the BigScroll (4 big scrolltexts and a music), the
Hidden screen (4 muzaks, a background moving around a scroll), the Axiom
logo (a starfiels, an Axiom with cool effects), and the last one I don't 
know the name but there's a disted background). This demo coded in GFA
is looking pretty good and you should watch out for it.

                         DEMO CHEATS


Ah well, only two, in fact there is only one:

IN THE HEMOSOUND DEMO II 
Press  UNDO  on  the  first screen in  order  to  get  some  more 
functions. 


In the last issue I was telling you about a cheat in the HMD  GEN 
4 demo.  You were supposed to type in HMD on the loading  screen. 
But due to something weird it did not work,  right ? Well, here's 
the solution, gte yourself one of these froggy keyboards !!!!
