Oh God! My Mums pestering me to do my homework so I've skived off 
to write another article for MAGGIE.
Okay,  so MAGGIE is the best disk magazine.  But what about those 
old fashioned paper mags? I reckon that ST USER and ST FORMAT are 
the best of the bunch so I thought I would review them to decide, 
finally, which is the best.....

                      ATARI ST USER
                      PRICE: 2.95
                     
At the moment I have the September issue of 'USER in front of  me 
(well,  slightly to my right, on my printer). The main title says 
"PUT YOU SHIRT ON IT!" which sounds a bit weird but then you read 
"Get  rich  quick with your ST" and this makes you want  to  read 
further.  There are only two other things on the cover which read 
"Protect and survive" and "Plus scantily clad desktop  digitisers 
comprehensive Masterclass corking DIY project".
This  months cover disk wasn't as good as usual but it  did  have 
the following:
SIDE 1
TORVAK THE WARRIOR (Demo)
DE ARCHIVER
POOLS PREDICTER
BOOTINFO (Acc)
RAINBOW COLOURS
DUALFORM 
PALETTE
SIDE 2
PERCUSSAMAN
SNAP
STPAGE
TOP DOG
ANGLO

Unfortunately  the  TORVAK  demo didn't work on 1987  ROMs  so  I 
couldn't look at it.  Bootinfo was quite an interesting accessory 
which  gave you loads of info about your ST and the  disk  inside 
it.  Pools predictor looked pretty nifty too and I think that  is 
what  I'll  be using when the new season starts.  Palette  was  a 
progam that shows all 512 colour from the STs palette (hence  the 
name,  I  suppose).  As  you  run the  mouse  pointer  over  each 
individual  colour  the progam tells you what the RGB  values  of 
each  one is,  so if you see a colour you like you can take  down 
the  values  and  then set your art package  to  that.  It  saves 
running  the values up and down in no particular order until  you 
accidently come acroos a colour you like. One thing you'll nearly 
always  find  the cover disk is a de-archiver  program.  This  is 
because some stuff on the disk have been archived.  This quite  a 
good idea coz they can fit more on the disk but it does get a bit 
annoying when you have to de-archive a whole side before you  can 
look at the stuff you want to.

The  game  reviews are very tough (they gave Flood  and  Damocles 
80%) but good to read.  One thing I don't like about them is that 
the  review is just one long piece of writing.  There are no  sub 
headings with things such as "Effects" and "Verdict" so you  have 
to  read  the whole thing to get to the bit  you  want.  However, 
Screen shots are plenty full and overall the reviews aren't  that 
bad. 

Apart  from  games 'USER reviews a wide range of other  soft  and 
hardware.  There are quite a few looks at cheap hardware which is 
good for people like me who are very poor and there is also stuff 
for people with a bit more dosh.

One  of  the best parts is the letters page,  it has  to  be  the 
biggest  ever and is always good to read.  I'm so bored  I  think 
I'll skip the rest and do the ratings:

Excellent  mag  that covers all aspects of  computing.  Can't  be 
bothered to say any more......

    
                     ST FORMAT

This  is  a relitively new mag compared to 'USER  (FORMAT  is  at 
no.14 while USER is at no.  55) but these people seem to have got 
it right first time. 
The main cover story on Septembers issue is called "Who gets your 
money?" which is about (guess what?) who gets your money when you 
buy a computer game.
The  cover is usually very good and this months is no  exception. 
On the disk are the following:
SIDE 1
RICK DANGEROUS (demo)
YOLANDA (demo)
GRAFFITI (Acc)
STARTUP
NO BOMBS
PRIVATE EYE (Acc)
SIDE 2
ROBOTZ
C TUTORIAL
STAR LC10
HARLEKIN FONTS
TRANSPORT 90
DIARY
TOS TELLER
FOLDER
SPEECH

The Rick Dick (as he is known) demo is not, as you might think, a 
demo of Rick Dick 2.  It is infact a very very very very etc etc. 
short  demo of the third level of the old one.  Its very easy  as 
well  and you'll probably complete the second time you  play  it. 
The  main  game demo however is Yolanda which is very  very  very 
very  very etc etc difficult but still quite good  (I  especially 
like  the intro screen!).  Graffiti is an accessory which  allows 
you to spray you desktop with lots of different colours while the 
Private eye acc.  tells you lots of interesting stuff about  your 
ST.  Robotz is an excellent 40 level PD game which will have  you 
hooked for hours.  The grafixxxx are amazing and the game play is 
descent too!  Speech is another interesting program.  Once it has 
loaded  you can type something in,  press return and it will  say 
what you have typed in. It really is quite good. 

Game reviews are quite tough sometimes but are still excellent. I 
always  read 'FORMAT reviews before buying a game because I  find 
they  are usually right.  They have a review split up so you  can 
just  read  the verdict at the end and there are just  the  right 
amount of screen shots. 

Reviews of other stuff are usually about expensive things which I 
can never aford but I still enjoy reading them. 

Lettes  page is good although I think it should be  alot  bigger. 
One thing I forgot to mention in the bit above was that both mags 
have  a  section to which people write in  with  their  technical 
difficulties. This is good on both mags.

There  is one good and bad thing about this mag and that is  that 
is very readable.  This is good while it lasts but I usually find 
that with in an hour of buying it, I've read it five times!

If  you've got enough money then I would strongly advise  you  to 
buy both,  but if money won't allow,  get ST  FORMAT.........then 
nick ATARI ST USER! They are both very very very very etc etc etc 
GOOD!
