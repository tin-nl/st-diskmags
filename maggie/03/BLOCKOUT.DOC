This is an easy one to describe: take Tetris and make it 3D. The 
only bad thing about it is that if you describe it like that, all 
there's left to say are some more or less serious drawbacks. To 
put it in a nutshell: Tetris was definately the better one.

In this game, you look from above into the tube, seeing the actual 
"brick" transparent, while all lying down are solid. The 
transparent brick is quite well displayed, but there might still 
be mistakes on your side because you thought the thing was the 
other way round. The solid bricks have the major disadvantage 
that you can't see the holes you have left under them, so you 
obviously can't plan much ahead. You don't have to think that 
much anyway, as on a complex 3D ground, there are many more 
possibilities to place your brick, making it almost impossible 
that you don't find a place where it will fit. So where's the 
difficulty? I can hear you ask. Well, if you have six keys to 
rotate and a limited amount of time to find the right one, there 
certainly is a difficulty. In that way, you sometimes 
place a brick wrong just because of sheer bad luck, which is not 
at all adding to the fun of playing. And there is some fun. 
More preciously I'd have to say that there's some fun left, 
but if you have a good version of Tetris somewhere near you (the 
next arcade included), you can forget about this one.

The CONCEPT is really poor: taking an existing idea and putting 
into 3D is nearly a common tactic to produce a game nowadays. It's 
just that in most cases the products make full advantage of all 
the new possibilities, while this one even has to fight its 
disadvantages.

The GRAPHICS are good and there's a smooth rotating effect. Too, 
you can identify "ground-structure" very well, as different 
heights have different colours. In some cases still confusing, 
though.

The PLAYABILITY is pushed up by the remains of the one of Tetris, 
but then again let down by the tricky controls and the fact that 
there's an awful lot of similar games around which fit better 
into the idea of thinking-games, making you soon want to play 
(e.g.) Tetris again instead of inviting you to another go 
on this one. Still:
