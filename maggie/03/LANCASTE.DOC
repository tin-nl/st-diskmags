
     LANCASTER!! A Stunning Review of a State-of-the-Art Program!!
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

LANCASTER  is one of those things (like ringworm??) that  appeared 
last year in the midst of several decent 3D solid vector games and 
promptly sank without trace...

This,  I  feel is unfair as it could easily attain a 'cult' status 
in  the fashion of a lot of old T.V proggies that are being  shown 
on  things like satellite & cable T.V.  ( or a load of old,  cheap 
bollocks that was no good first time around??)

LANCASTER  certainly fits into the latter category anyway,  it was 
based  on some 3D Solid vectors got together by CRL,  who were  in 
the  process of writing a game based on a giant cat attacking  the 
Houses of Parliament (??!!) for which several screenshots appeared 
in  various  publications (remember??) but which came  to  nought, 
joining the ranks of such 'classics as DICK SPECIAL by  RAINBIRD.. 
(Whatever happened to Dick Special, and EPT, also by Rainbird???)

Anyway,  the  graphic routines were dredged-up from the  wreckage, 
and  served  up  after re-heating in Lancaster.  ON  TO  THE  GAME 
ITSELF....Woke  up  one morning,  switched on my machine,  nuthin' 
happened  and  I  got those NOT SWITCHED ON AT  THE  WALL  AT  ALL 
BLUES....After all that,  it loaded up a digi-picture title screen 
and played a long droning title soundtrack,  a sort of Dambuster-
theme  type tune with all the interesting wiggly bits that give  a 
tune  character and identity removed.  After several years (enough 
time  for  the  Second World War to go into extra  time,  and  for 
GERMANY  to  win  on penalty kicks!!!!) It  loads  to  an  options 
screen.  you  can  have all sorts of things,  such as searchlights 
on/off,  expert fighters,  barrage balloons, easy/harder missions, 
almost  everything you could want except "Can I go home  and  turn 
off this machine please??"

After  that,   it  cuts  to  a  briefing-room/scorebored  sequence 
(deliberate  miszspeillling) and thence to a screen,  drawn by  an 
art-package,  one  suspects,  with  all  the  interesting  colours 
carefully  removed  beforehand where the crew board  their  plane. 
We  then go to a takeoff sequence which goes on the lines of "  If 
they  want anymore than two frames per second updating,  then they 
can  bog  off!!" and you are now up in the air and ready  to  go!! 
(Wow!!)

'Flying' to the target area is done across a flat 2D map with your 
'aircraft',  a  little  Royal Air-Force decal chasing your  cursor 
like  a  heat-seeking  ferret into enemy  territory.  The  trouble 
really  starts once you are into the German  'Midfield'  (Occupied 
France..)  whereupon the German 'Players,  fiercely encouraged  by 
Beckenbauer no doubt, weigh in heeeavily to try to take the 'ball' 
off you...At this point the game goes to a rear-gunner  viewpoint, 
you  have discovered the dark secret of LANCASTER,  it is not much 
more  than a giant re-write of a very old game called  TAIL-GUNNER 
which has been around since ZX80 days.

About  this time,  I booted the game up to remind me what goes  on 
and where,  firstly on the credit screen,  a person or group known 
as the 'Shoproom Dummies' appears, well quite....Also when you are 
being  attacked  by various ME 109's and ME 110's  they  must  get 
extremely well pissed-up before getting into their planes as  they 
come  at you in a number of highly individual ways.  The attacking 
HUNBOSCHE undesirables corkscrew wildly across the sky (to  ensure 
they  miss you completely??) and appear from underneath as  though 
they  had  been flung up by a giant hand,  rather than  flown.  To 
crown these prior achievements, the attacking fighters appear very 
close behind you, I mean close enough to identify the pilot, Fritz 
Gruber age 23, 3 zits on his upper lip, proud possessor of an Iron 
Cross 1st class...

As  the  man  flying  your Lancaster is the  man  who  penned  the 
immortal  song  "Hitler  has  only  got  one  ball,,"  the  entire 
LUFTWAFFE has orders to seek and destroy him,  judging by the fact 
that  you  have  to 'deal' with what seems  like  several  hundred 
attackers,  hell-bent  on  ruining your evening.  Needless to say, 
weight of numbers soon tells, and you are spiralling helplessly to 
the ground, CRASH!! BOOOOMMMMM!!!! CRACKLE!!!! AAAAAGGGGHHHH!!!!

You  can  also shoot at passing barrage balloons,  big  fat  round 
things,  not unlike Claire Rayner, and also shoot at incoming FLAK 
(pardon???)  which can severly harm your health but seems  to  co-
exist  quite  happily  with the ME 109's for  some  reason  (badly 
thought  out  simulation...)  In  most cases you  do  not  get  to 
complete  your  mission,  but this time I did,  and you next get a 
bomb-run where you point a bomb-sight/cursor at various targets. A 
successful  drop  is rewarded with a tiny explosion.  Upon  safely 
returning home,  you are met by a warm,  moist,  badly drawn semi-
dressed female, as good an ending to a mission as any I feel...

TO  CONCLUDE,,  I  don't  actually hate this game as much  as  the 
review  seems to indicate,  it can be quite playable WHEN DRUNK as 
you  can  syncronize perfectly with the equally  arseholed  German 
fighter  aircraft attacking you,  and it is best enjoyed in  mixed 
company  (IE. SOME people drunk on BITTER,  other people stiffed on 
LAGER.....)
It  is now available on a compilation but i can only say  this  to 
anyone who paid full-price for it originally- TOUGH SHIT!!
