                          IN (have a guess where ?)
                                       by Michael Schuessler

Well, this extended report is especially for all these people all 
over  the  world who can't afford to go to Germany for  a  boring 
Computer Show.  This does not mean that I a rich or anything like 
that,  but it does mean that I was in Germany at the time of  the 
show and thanks to a (NOW) GREAT FRIEND OF MINE  BJORN BIRNENBAUM 
I  managed to get a lift to Germany (although I had to pay for  a 
third of the ful and some other expenses. All together there were 
three of us in the car (the other on was another guy from Bjorn's 
great STE Club,  HI AXEL, HOW MANY BATTERIES HAVE YOU USED SO FAR 
FOR  YOUR LYNX ?) Anyway,  after having broken just  about  every 
speed  limit (when going 180 km/h) we finally arrived at  Thalion 
at  about 6 pm on that Friday.  The next day we went to the  show 
rather early in order to have a good look around.  

First  of  all let me tell you that a show in Germany  differs  a 
great  deal  from any show in England that I have  ever  attended 
(  and that is quite a lot).  The shows in Germany are  far  more 
businesswise orientated.  You will actually have problems to find 
a colour monitor whereas most,  but of course not all,  shows  in 
England mainly concern themselves with the games industry. 
Anayway,  furthermore,  this  article  will deal  with  many  new 
software  releases and a brief look at the TT (which looks  quite 
promising although I had no chance to get a close look at it).
Close  to the end I will deal with IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO  attended 
the show,  for example,  demo crews,  great musicians like Jochen 
Hippel and others.....
Something  else  which is different to a Show in England  is  the 
price,  the Dusseldorf Messe roughly cost œ1.30 whereas you would 
pay for a much smaller show here in England about œ3.
    
After  having  arrived  with the car,  a bus brought  us  to  the 
correct hall which saved us a very long and exhausting walk.  The 
stands were devided up in two halls (11/12).  The entire size  of 
the  show would be around 20.000 square metres which is  probably 
twice  the size of any show in England.  This does not mean  that 
there are any more stands, but every stand has far more space and 
everything  is  more wide spread and people don't  need  to  push 
themselves throught these small passage ways.  In general I would 
say that the atmosphere is opener. 


THE TT:

I hope that this machine will be introduced in the UK faster than 
it  took them with some of the other  machines,  anyway,  the  TT 
bases on the 32 Hz Motorola 68030 processor.  The TT is a 32  bit 
machine  and is fully TOS compatible (at least that's  what  they 
say,  I think we should wait for a little while until it has been 
thoroughly tested by a few users). The machine is equipped with a 
standard 4 Megabytes and can be extended up to 26  Megabytes.  As 
usual  you  can  plug  in all  other  machines  like  modems  and 
printers....


SOFTWARE FOR THE ATARI PORTFOLIO

CAR OFFICE
This  program is quite useful if you run your office from  within 
a  car.  Somebody usually wants you to keep track where  you  are 
going, how much money you spend on petrol and who was in the car. 
Now,  instead of scribbling all this down on a piece of paper and 
repeating  this procedure every time you want to go somewhere  yo 
you simply get out your Atari Portfolio and run this program  and 
it  will  then  store  all the data and there  will  then  be  no 
confusing  at the end of the year when you want to add up to  see 
how  much  money you spend or even if you want to know  how  many 
kilometres you drove ! 

WHAT IS LEFT ? 
This  program has mainly been written for shop owners  and  other 
people to check what is left in their stock and what needs to  be 
reordered.   You simply type all the things into the computer and 
then at the end print the result.

These  here were only two examples of the use of the great  Atari 
Portfolio.  There were many more in my press report  but they are 
all in German and I just cannot be bothered to translate them all 
into English and anyway, this here was only an example. 


GFA BASIC CONVERTER TO C

GFA Basic is a great language.  Version 3.5 is probably the  best 
Basic  that has ever existed,  BUT now,  somebody has  written  a 
great  product,  a converter from GFA to C.  The  basic  program, 
after  it  has  been converted is straight away  runnable  in  C. 
Additionally,  they  are  trying  to add functions  so  that  the 
convertion will be accessable a lot easier with only a few simple 
key  presses,  it will also give you additional  error  messages. 
There  are  also many more features which they are  intending  to 
include  in future versions.  There price is rather high but  you 
sure get a great quality product for this (~œ210).


Other new programs have been released like:
Adimens 3.0,  Capslock.prg, Turbo C 2.0, Turbo Debugger 1.0, CNC-
Terminal (for Portfolio),  ST Card System,  Diskus,  Tempus-WORD, 
CISYSTEM,  CIS-LOHN  &  GEHALT 2,  C-LAB + A  LOT  OF  ADDITIONAL 
SOFTWARE, ST GIRO....

I  could have now gone on listing one program after the other  as 
there  were so many new releases,  but I am of the  opinion  that 
there is not much point in doing so as none,  except the  readers 
in Germany will know what I am talking about.  So I will now stop 
this and continue with some more general information. 

The  U.K.  were also present at the show,  but as I have  already 
mentioned  that the ST in England mainly only consists of a  game 
market  and  therefore Atari UK was only present with  an  Arcade 
Game Section.     A game section in England would be filled  with 
little kiddies fighting over the computer,  but in Germany,  most 
of the machines were empty and occasionally some bored people had 
a quick game. 

Another  new  release at the Show was a new game  for  the  Atari 
Lynx.   It is the great ROADBLASTERS.  The Lynx convertion that I 
have seen there is probably th best game I have ever seen on this 
small  machine.  The sound is simply perfect,  the  graphix  even 
better  and  the gameplay is probably the best for such  a  small 
computer/game machine.
 
This  article will continue tomorrow evening as I am  too  tirted 
now and I have to get up at about 7 am (which I think is far  too 
early).....  Yawnnn...  The  Toten Hosen is th best band  in  the 
world.... yaw...... sexy leggs are on tele at the moment......


IMPORTANT PEOPLE

The show was attended by many important crews and single  people. 
2 of these crews even had there own stand there. One of the crews 
was  the  German  Alliance  and  the  other  one  was  from   the 
Respectables (or whatever they are called!!!).  Here's a list  of 
people  who  were there and whom you could have met if  you  went 
there:  Chis ofTGE,  S.F. of NewMode, thingybob of Chaos, Michael 
of  TEX,  Jochen  of  TEX,  Es  of  TEX,  Michael  of  TNT,  Marc 
(programmer of Wings of Death), all the Lost Boys (Oxygene, D.I., 
Manikin, Sammy Joe (yes, that's me) & Spaz), AXE of Delight, ULM, 
Fury of the Replicants,  WSU, OFFBEAT, MCA, Aenigmatica, ah well, 
I  bet  that  there were millions more  there,  I  have  probably 
forgotten some of the most important people, so, sorry guys.....


All in all I think that the show was rather boring except all the 
people that came and the evenings.
The  show  I  am  looking  forward  to  again   is  the  European 
Entertainment  Show here in London from the 14th to the  16th  of 
September.


          This is it, (at least for now)

                                   Michael
