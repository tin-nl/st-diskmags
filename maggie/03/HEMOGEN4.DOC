                              REVIEWED BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

First  of  all  I would like to apologize to  the  Hemoroids  for 
having referred to them as Hembroids,  I must have read the  name 
wrongly somewhere. Sorry guys.

Anyway, these guys from France have send me their demo with which 
they participated in the GEN 4 competition. 
The  demo starts off with a black screen on which it asks you  in 
French to type something. As I have already mentioned in the last 
issue you have to type in HMD.  Typing that in there is a  little 
problem,  as you might know, the French have a different keyboard  
and  therefore,  as the Hemoroids appear to be checking  for  the 
actual key that is pressed and not the letter,  you can only  see 
the  screen if you have a French keyboard or you can be  bothered 
to  work out what keys it is you have to press.  ( When I was  in 
France I saw the screen and I wasn't particularly impressed  with 
it,  basically  what  I  am saying is that it  is  not  worth  it 
spending more than 20 minutes on finding the correct keys !!).

The  menu is pretty boring as it only consists of a  scroller  at 
the  bottom ,  a piece of graphix saying Hemoroids in the  bottom 
border  and  two sets of different volume  indicators.  The  tune 
that is playing is as usual a Mad Max tune.  There are also  some 
bizare graphix on the screen which are pretty hard to make out. 
There  is a key that you can press on the 1st and the 2nd  screen 
on order to pause it, it is the 'F' key.

The 1st screen is:
F1: THE GIGA SCREEN
There  is nothing in between each screen except some text  saying 
LOADING  with  some  greenish colour bars in  it.  After  that  a 
message  appears  on  top  of the screen to  tell  you  that  the 
computer is now depacking.
When the screen is finally running (it bombs quite often and  you 
don't  get to see the screen) you notice the many colours on  the 
screen at fist.  The next thing one sees are the many sprites  on 
the screen forming a circle.  In the sprites it says GEN  4.  The 
sprites  describe  a  circle where they also  go  across  various 
borders (left,  right,  bottom and top). Behind the sprites there 
are rasters at the top and the bottom going into the distance.
As  you  have  probably  realized that I  have  not  mentioned  a 
scroller  yet,  well,  there  is no real scroller  but  there  is 
something pretty similar to that.  In the circle,  formed by  the 
sprites,  some text (with colour bars in it) is always plotted on 
the  screen.  As already mentioned you can press the 'F'  key  to 
pause the screen. 

F2: Distort Screen      
As the name says,  most of the things taking place in this screen 
are wobbling.  In the bottom border is a sign saying Generation 4 
and it is wobbling. There is also some text moving/wobbling about 
on the screen (the text says 3615 Gen 4).  In the background is a 
one plane piece of graphix moving about. As it is crystal one can 
see some more graphix lying behind it,  in fact it is not  really 
any graffix, it is just some font.

F3: The Full Scroller
Everything  in  this  screen is only one plane  again  with  some 
colour bars.  This screen is very very colourful and therefore  I 
think  that  it is visually very disturbing.  As in some  of  the 
other screens there are no borders (at least that's what it looks 
like).  The  rest  of  the screen is full  of  little  pieces  of 
paralaxing  graffix.  The  little pieces of graffix  also  wobble 
occasionally. This screen is very very confusing. 

Here' some additional information on the format of the  disk,  it 
is  single sided and only 265K are used.  The program boots  from 
the auto folder.
