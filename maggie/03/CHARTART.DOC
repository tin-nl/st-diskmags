
Well,  well,  well.  Zae  again  to bore you with another  of  my 
unrealistico-fantastico-fucko-imagino-scientifico-lamo   article. 
This time it deals about the ST charts that my crew (NeXT for the 
dudes  always sleeping at the back of the classroom)  are  making 
for the best disk magazine : Zaggie ...heee...sorry : Maggie ! As 
a matter of fact, I heard 

Illegal  of  the Fallen Angels of the Empire was  also  making  a 
Charts demo and I must admit that I was quite upset of that  (and 
I'm still).  The reason for which he made these charts is that he 
thinks  our  are wrong and especially because the Empire  is  not 
rated  at  the  first place in the  cracker  crews  part.  I  can 
understand  that  coz'  it's true that  the  Replicants  are  not 
actually  as fast as they were because of some internal  problems 
(Snake is now at the army and the other cracker (Maxi) is  living 
in  north of France while the swapper (me) is living in south  of 
France...).  But  even if the Empire was the best  cracking  crew 
these last times, it doesn't mean that everybody on ST knows it ! 
Next's Charts' main objective is to show through a demo (a little 
one...)  the opinion of the majority of ST owners,  for  that  we 
send each month a questionnary to all the ST crews and to a bunch 
of  "normal"  users  (usually  called  "lamers"  but  they  count 
anyway).  They  answer to this questionnary by writing  down  who 
they think to be the 5 best cracking groups,  demo coders, demos, 
etc...  Then when all the answers (37 crews and 42 normal  users) 
are  collected we check them with a programm which gives all  the 
rates.  This programm takes care of the number of times the  crew 
was voted AND its place (1st,  2nd, etc...) each time. So I don't 
think  there's  anything to complain about !  When  you  see  The 
Cuddly  demos as the best demo on ST it doesn't mean it's  really 
the  best one (technically there are at least 2 demos  which  are 
better),  it means that people on ST says that the Cuddly is  for 
them  the  best  demo on ST (read again  2584  times  and  you'll 
understand the sentence).  For the Empire : you are very fast and 
very  good  crackers but if none receive your cracks why  do  you 
want them to vote for you ?  If you make a crack and just rush to 
the  BBS  then  we can give a modem and a  calling  card  to  the 
Masters  and they will deserve to be the best cracker crew too  ! 
Remember :  no spread means no vote,  if I spread your cracks for 
one month instead of spreading the Replicants' ones then you  can 
bet  that everybody will vote for you coz' during one month  they 
would have receive only Empire cracks ! It's the same problem for 
the crackers rates :        Snake himself knows that he's not the 
second best cracker on ST but when someone see most of the  games 
he  receives  cracked by Snake what do you want him  to  think  ? 
Hmmmm ?  What ?  Good question, no ? (Fuck ! I went to the toilet 
for a few minutes and now my pizza is cold !). So please consider 
our Charts as a mirror of the ST's scene opinion and when you see 
the  Empire rated at the second place don't say to yourself  that 
the  Charts are wrong but that your swapping/spreading system  is 
wrong  (when  I receive the Replicant's cracks I switch on  my  2 
1040 STs with their blitz connected on and start making about 120 
copies of the crack,  then I put the disks in enveloppes  already 
adressed  and stamped and the same day everything is  brought  to 
the  post office...  It took me a long time to organize all  this 
but  now the Replicants are considered as the best  cracker  crew 
(and  moreover it's with TCB the only still active member of  the 
"Union"   (yes  Illegal,   I  know  what  you  think  about   the 
Union...))).

     Well,  I  hope that now everything is clear,  if I  see  the 
second Illegal's Charts then it will mean that I wasn't...

P.  S. : sans rancune Stephane, on en avait deja parle et je n'ai 
toujours pas change d'avis (toi non plus d'ailleurs).
