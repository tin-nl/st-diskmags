KLAX (The Review!)
------------------

By Zogg of the WATCHMEN (or as SOMEBODY ELSE of the LOST BOYS 
would say; SOMEBODY ELSE!!!)

Erh... oh hell, I wish my mum would stay out of my computer 
cupboards, she's tidied up again and hidden all my manuals and 
games...

um...  Here's some Watchmen news to read while I look for 
KLAX...

The Watchmen have a new member (he doesn't do anything, but 
he's good for a laugh and he's stinking (geddit?) rich!) who is 
the totaly and wonderfully wonderful personen;

                       THE SKUNK 
   (CHEERS, CRIES, AND SCREAMS OF PURE SEXUAL DESIRE)

The Watchmen are also coding a new demo (only our 3rd, but it's 
tip top quality) which is totally new and lovely, and should be 
out for the ATARI SHOW in france in OCTOBER.

YEAH! Found it at last!!!

       Klax is another one of those games that doesn't at first 
look very good, but boy OH BOY is it ADDICTIVE! The basic idea 
of Klax is to create as many klaxes as possible, a Klax (as the 
manual says) is a pile of the same coloured tiles. The game is 
played by catching multi coloured tiles with your paddle as 
they drop off the end of a convayor belt. The paddle can hold 
up to five titles and you must press the fire button to flip 
the top tile into the bin below. By flipping the tiles into the 
correct places in the bin your can make Klaxes, a bit like that 
game Connect Four (the one where you had to drop coloured 
counters into a grid thing). As the Klaxes are made they 
dissolve away allowing any tiles above to drop down further. 
The gameplay is made harder as the tiles won't automaticly drop 
into the bin, if your paddle isn't under it when it gets to the 
end, then it commits suicide and leaps off the end, and of 
course, you are only allowed a certain number of "drops" before 
the computer decides your crap and does a GAME OVER. The 
gameplay varies though the levels by adding certain tasks, ie 
like having to complete a certain number of diagonal Klaxes, 
scoring a certain amount of points or having to servive a set 
number of tiles. A good point of the game is the option to do a 
bit of double Klaxing, plugging another joystick in allows a 
second player to Klax away on the other half of the screen, 
both players play completely seperatly, so you don't get held 
back if your best friend's the worst Klaxer in the world.
       If you had sleepless nights over TETRIS or even if you 
didn't then YOU HAVE TO BUY KLAX.
