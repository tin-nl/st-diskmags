Introducing Myself
------------------

If you've already read some reviews, you might have noticed a 
new name under the reviews. That was mine (Mr. Gibe). I'm a swiss 
guy, 19 years old, schoolboy, and I'm a new staff writer for this 
wonderful magazine. The reason why is that I like English, 
writing and computing (simple, isn't it). Now to my person: I'm a 
graphican and one half of Black Byte, a crew most of you won't 
ever have heard of.

Time to change that.

Well, as you might have guessed, we're a two-man-crew (me and Dr. 
Diddle, who is doing the coding). There are some plans to train a 
third member (coder, too), but this seems to be some hard work, 
as till yesterday, he was still trying to do a point-routine 
using line-A subroutines. Well, must have read in some Gem-book 
that this was a fast way ...

Our "work" until now consists in a few intros, lots of non-
finished scrollers and a little game still under developpement. 
Quite enough to keep two people busy, anyway.

 
One word to my reviewing'n'rating system:

Most things are more or less my own opinion, so you'll better 
check the game yourself before buying. At this place, I also have 
to thank the Megashop, St. Gallen, for giving me the possibility 
to check out some Games (F 19, Projectyle and Block out).

CONCEPT-rating: This will tell you how original the whole thing 
is and how well the single parts of the game fit together and 
build some solid background.

GRAPHICS-rating: As I'm a graphican myself, I'm not too merciless in 
this matter. Too, the rating will depend on the game-type, not on 
the mass or impessivness of the graphics. I prefer some small 
sprites fitting into the game instead of bigger, more frightful 
ones that make the game play worse. A 90+% rating means that the 
graphics are considerably adding to the fun.

SOUND: A hard one to judge, so sometimes you won't even find a 
rating. Again, more than 90% means it's a vital part of the fun.

PLAYABILITY: This could also be called "overall", but includes 
controls and so on. Anyway, who wants to play a game with 
sluggish controls?
