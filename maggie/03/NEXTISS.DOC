                         BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

     Well,  I haven't even got this issue here quite finished yet 
and I am already supposed to be able to tell you what will be  in 
the  4th issue ?  I will try to do my best.   For the next  issue 
there  are various possibilities !  As you might know there is  a 
demo  coders  only  convention in Holland  organized  by  Digital 
Insanity,   i.e.   the  Lost  Boys.   For  some  more  background 
information  I  should  inform you about  another  disc  magazine 
called Das Diskmagazin.  This magazine is produced by a friend of 
mine from Germany called Timo.  As was talking to him during  the 
my 2 week stay in Germany and we thought that it would be quite a 
good  idea  to maybe produce a joined christmas  issue  and  then 
release it at the convention in Holland !  Anyway, this is only a 
remote possibility as this would mean that a lot of  organisation 
would  be needed for putting two disk mags into one !  A  further 
problem  there is that it is very likely that I am not  going  to 
Holland !?! This would mean that it will be even harder to finish 
off this issue ! We will see !! 

     In case I will release maggie on its own it will look pretty 
much  like  this issue except that it will not come on  2  disks. 
There  will  be many more interviews with some  of  the  greatest 
crews like Sync,  Omega and many others ! There will be some more 
exceptionally   good graffix by David Moss (Spaz) and some  great 
tunes by ENS from Galtan 6.  As usual there will be some more gfa 
basic  commands  explained with  their  functions/examples.   The 
coming  issue  will also have a great intro (I have no  idea  who 
will  do  that !) and there will be some more  great  reviews  of 
games  and demos.  The next issue might even contain  a  playable 
demo  version of the game currently written by the Lost Boys  for 
Thalion Software.

As I think that that's already it again for the next issue I will 
better stop typing this article here and rather try to fix a  bug 
in the main menu so that you will soon be able to read this issue 
here,
