The designers of Dynamite Dux, Rick Dangerous and Swithblade (CORE
Design) are back with Impossamole. It's the story of Monty a mole.
She's planed on a planet to save it. At the contact of the athmospher
Monty transformed into a Super-Mole.. There is five (!) levels in 
this game. The must complete the four first levels to access the 
fifth. The four first levels are : the Klendike mines, the Orient, 
the Amazone and the ice land. The fifth level is the Bermuda Triangle.
In the bermuda Triangle the ennemies are really various you must 
blast pirates, ghosts and all sorts of cracked game and demo sellers!
The graphics are in the style of Rick Dangerous : they're quite good. 
The music is really cool even if it is a simple 3-voices one. The game 
is difficult but the ones who had finished Rick Dangerous will find 
Impossamole quite easy. Impossamole is a hit!
