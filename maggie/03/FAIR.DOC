Well  I couldn't be bothered to do a review of this fair so  I'll 
just tell you what happened when I went there.

1 1/2 weeks before the show:
DING DONG! Uuuggghh..........snore.........
DING DONG! Uuuggghh..........what time is it? 8.26 AM!!..snore...
DING DONG!  ...oh no,  that'll be my game!!!(jump, well crawl out 
of bed and down stairs)
DING  DONG DING DONG!!  Alright you fucking  bitch,  I'm  coming. 
(open the door) Thankyou. 
Yeh it's my game (DAMOCLES).(open envelope) Hello what's all this 
then.  Not  only  is my game in here,  there are also  some  free 
tickets to something called the ALL FORMATS COMPUTER FAIR.
For  the first 3 hours I was actually trying to work out  whether 
these  actully  where tickets or not coz on them  they  told  you 
where to get tickets and how much it costs to get in.  I  finally 
decide  that they are tickets and (after playing DAMOCLES  for  a 
few hours) phone Raphael.
DON: Hello Raph
RAPH: Hello
DON: I've got some tickets to go to some fair, wanna come?
RAPH: Yeh, whens it on?
DON: in about a weeks time.
RAPH: Okay
DON: I'll phone you up later and give you a time.
RAPH: Don't be stupid, you can't give me a time.
DON: Goodbye 
RAPH: See ya.

              A FEW DAYS LATER...........

My Sister: DON! Phone for you!
DON:  A  phone?  Oh Jo you shouldn't have,  and it's not even  my 
birthday! I would've prefered a Porshe you know.
My sister: Oh shut up.
DON: Hello.
ANTHONY: Hi
DON: Oh, it's you. Wait a mo while I go and hang myself.
ANTHONY: I just got KICK OFF 2.
DON:  Really. Hang on. In your envelope did you find free tickets 
to a fair?
ANTHONY: Yeh.
DON: How many?
ANTHONY: two
DON: Ha ha I got three!
ANTHONY: Who are you going with?
DON: Raphael and Michaelangelo probably. Who are you going with?
ANTHONY:  don't know yet.  Listen , I'll meet you up the station, 
on Sunday and we can go together.
DON: Oh gooood (said sarcastically)
ANTHONY:  I  think we should meet at 8.15 am to make sure we  get 
there on time.
DON: But it doesn't start till 10.00!
ANTHONY: You can't be too early
DON: Yes you can, go away.

MIKE: No
DON:  Oh  well,  I've got a spare one,  you can  have  it.  We're 
metting at the station at 8.15
MIKE: 8.15!!!etc etc.
DON: Yeh 8.15
MIKE Okay, see yah then
DON: Bye.

              THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING

DONATELLO:  Totaly  amazing person (it's me!!).  Wears  black  T-
Shirts,  jeans and trainers and generally looks really hansome. A 
complete ST/SEX freak, the only two important things in his life, 
apart  from TV,  where he likes to watch programs about  sex  and 
computers (not at the same time though.).

MICHAELANGELO:  A  bit weird as he always wears bright orange  or 
pink  T-Shirts and track suit bottoms. Likes to look at  pictures 
(or the real thing) of naked men. Also ST freak.

RAPHAEL: Latest member of TTMNT. Wears normal T-Shirts and jeans.
The  only  person I know that managed to blow up his ST  when  he 
wasn't even in the same room as it!

ANTHONY LEHMANN:  Bought an ammeeega and has never been forgiven. 
He  had a spare ticket but has got no freinds so he couldn't  get 
rid of it. The only reason why he came along was so we could take 
the piss out of him alot.

                           SUNDAY

BBBBBBBRRRRRHHHHHH BBBBBRRRRRRHHHH!!(my alarm clock)
CCRRUNCCHHHHH!!!!!!!(my broken alarm clock)
God  it's 7.00 in the morning on sunday!!!!!!!(in  no  particular 
order:  Brush my teeth,  go to the bog,  get out of bed,  wash my 
hands, eat breakfast, sit down and wait for Raphael)
8.00 am:  mmmmm...  Raph should be here by now. I wonder where he 
is?
8.12:  I see Michaelangelo passing my house to go to the  station 
and invite him in.
8.14: Phone up Raphael.

DON: Hello, is Raphael there.
HIS MUM: He's just left.
DON: So he's not there.
HIS MUM: He's just leaving.
DON: Is he there.
HIS MUM: yes
DON: Can I speak to him please
HIS MUM: Yes, wait a minute...
RAPH: Hello
DON: Your late.
RAPH: Yes I know.
DON: We'll be at the station
RAPH: Okay, bye
DON: Bye.

Michaelangelo and I arrive at the station to find that Anthnoy is 
not there yet, even though we are late. Michaelangelo wants to go 
to the newsagent to buy PLAYGIRL but I manage to stop him.

8.28:  Everyone has arrived.  Although everyone else has bought a 
child  travel card Raphael doesn't.  The ticket  machine  doesn't 
except old five pence pieces and when he tells the guard that  he 
is fifteen the guard tells himto get an adult,  so he  does.  Our 
travel cards cost us about 90p while he had to pay over 2.00  for 
his and we're all the same age as well!
9.30:  After  getting  lost about five times (we  were  following 
Anthony) we finnally arrive at Victoria.
9.50:  We  manage to walk past MacDonalds without going in for  a 
second breakfast and arrive at the fair.
9.55:  A  nice  young lady (wearing shorts) walks  down  the  que 
trying  to flog ticket for next month fair for  one  pound.  This 
sounds  pretty  good (they usually cost 3.00) so  everyone  apart 
from Anthony buys one.  After Anthonys failed attempt to chat her 
up  (he asked her when they would let us in,  and if  both  halls 
were  being  used) the doors open and we  enter.  We  were  quite 
surprised when we were told that only one hall was being used and 
even more surprised when we actually got in.  It was quite small. 
While  the 16 bit fair had taken up two halls this one only  took 
one.  And that hall didn't have as much stuff in as at the 16 bit 
either. On the other hand there were only about 1/4 of the people 
there  as  there was at the 16 bit so it was quite easy  to  move 
about and you didn't have to stand behind a really sweaty fat man 
while trying to buy stuff.
As  soon  as we got in we decided to zoom round the show  to  see 
what was there.  This took us about two seconds.  As far as I can 
tell  there  was only one PD libary in the whole place  but  once 
Michaelangelo  saw  it he was there for the rest of  the  day.  I 
don't know what everyone else had come for but I was looking  out 
for the following:
Large disk box
Midwinter (if I could find it for less than eighteen puonds)
Some PD,  but definately no porn stuff (I'm not a very good  liar 
am I?)
Anarchy (if I could find it)
A new joystick
Some  commercial  games  that I never really wanted  but  that  I 
bought because they seemed like a good deal at the time.
Almost  immidiatly Raphael and Michaelangelo buy  disk  boxes.  I 
don't because they are only 80 capacity and I want a 100 capacity 
one.  Then Anthony buys a game. Before buying it he asks me if it 
is any good.  I say I don't know because, to me, all games on the 
ammeega  are crap.  He ends up buying ARCHIPELAGOS (I don't  know 
how to spell it) for about œ1.50.  Everyone is trying to make  me 
buy something so I get a 100 capacity disk box. 
As  this was the ALL FORMATS COMPUTER FAIR there were  more  than 
just  16-bit  computers and ameegas.  One stall was full  of  old 
Amstrads  and Spectrums.  There were also dusty disk  drives  and 
printers all of which had bits missing and looked very dodgy.
The time is now 11.00 am and everyone is already hungry/knackered 
so we go to MacDonalds for a bite of mad cowes disease.
When  we arrive back we decide that we should all buy  two  games 
each so we can get rid of all our money.  I keep seeing MIDWINTER 
but everyone is trying to flog it for about œ20.00.  I can't  see 
ANARCHY any where.  On one stall I see FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS 
for œ4.99. It looks pretty good so I decide to get it and with it 
I  am  given  a  free T-Shirt  (ooohhh).  Raphael  wants  to  get 
ARCHIPELAGOS  but goes to the wrong stand and ends up  buying  it 
for œ2.75.  Michaelangelo buys a few disks of PD and then  starts 
looking for a beat 'em up game. He eventually decides on CHAMBERS 
OF SHAOLIN. I see CASTLE MASTER at one stand for œ10.00 and think 
I might buy it but Raphael decides he will and gets there  before 
me.   Anthony  fishes  a  D.I.Y.  joystick  from  the  "5  second 
guarantee"  box for œ1.00.  This looks pretty good as  there  are 
four micro switches in the pack (I broke a switch on my  Zipstick 
while playing KICK OFF 2). When I get to the box, however, I find 
that  all the other packs have got a faulty sticker on them, so I 
decide against buying one.  By now it is about 1.00pm and Raphael 
and  Michaelangelo want to go home.  I still haven't got  a  good 
game yet so I go up to one stand and ask for MIDWINTER.  The  guy 
says  that  he ain't got any at the moment but he  will  have  in 
about 15mins. When I ask him the price he says "œ16.90". I decide 
I want it and wait for the next 15mins.  I finally get  MIDWINTER 
and  we are about to leave when I remember that I haven't  looked 
for a joystick yet.  I leave Michaelangelo and Raphael looking at 
some PD stuff and head off, with Anthony following to have a look 
around.  I  come across the Quickjoy Jetfighter which  looks  and 
feel really good.  I really want an arcade type stick though so I 
decide to leave it.  I then find a Black Cruiser which looks well 
deeecent  so  I  ask the bloke behind the  stall  about  it.  The 
convesation goes something like this:
DON: How much is this joystick?
BLOKE: œ10.95 for use with a Spectrum or œ8.95 otherwise
ANTHONY: What does it do?
BLOKE:  (goes on to explain how you can change the sensitivety of 
the stick to suit the individual)
DON: does it have autofire?
BLOKE: No
DON: Doesn't sound very good if it hasn't got autofire does it?
ANTHONY: No, you really need autofire don't you?
DON:  mmmmm...shall I buy it?..........Naaaa....I would if it had 
autofire  but seeing as it hasn't I think I'll leave it  (Anthony 
and  I walk awy from the stand saying the word "autofire"  a  few 
more times as we go).
After this we begin to make our way home. 

Stuff I Bought:
I didn't get much stuff at this fair coz I spent most of my money 
at the 16 Bit computer fair.  I did get most of the things I  was 
looking for though:
Large disk box
Midwinter
A  commercial  game  that I never really  wanted  but  bought  it 
because it seemed like a good deal at the time. (FOFT)
Some Peee Deee.

This fair wasn't that good compared to the 16 Bit but there  were 
a  few  good deals around (if you wanted  to  buy  something).  I 
wouldn't pay the œ3 that it usually costs to get in but I did get 
a ticket for the next show (Sept. 1st) for œ1.

That's  all I'm writing for this article so you might as well  go 
away  and read one of the other bits of crap..er I mean  articles 
in this mag. You could, of course read this article again.....
