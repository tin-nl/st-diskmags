       SUMMER FROM THE 20TH OF JULY - 29TH OF  JULY 1990

Well,  first  of all I will give you some general information  on 
this  so  called  computer convention.  About  2  months  back  I 
received a letter from this guys called ZAE (from NEXT).  At that 
point  I  had never ever heard of them before.  But Fury  of  the 
Replicants  also  wrote a few bits and bobs on the  letter  so  I 
thought  that they must be quite good.  So far so good,  2  weeks 
later I received another letter asking me whether or not I  would 
like  to  come  to Marseille (that's in the south  of  France)  ? 
Stupid question that,  of course I said yes.  I then asked  Phil/ 
Andy  of the BBC,  Derek and Mob whether or not they feel like  a 
holiday too ?
So it came that 5 of us sat in the train aiming for Marseille  on 
the 20th of July (some time around 3pm). Phil brought his massive 
GettoBlaster  with  him with which we managed to piss  off  lodsa 
people on the over-crowded train.  On the ferry we bought 24 cans 
of  beer  and some wine (yak !!).  In the train I (yes  it's  me, 
Sammy  Joe typing all this here) managed to get into  a  sleeping 
cabine  with three lovely girls.  But instead of going after  the 
girls I decided to get drunk as some other guy in our cabine  had 
some of my favourite drink:  VODKA. After short time I was pretty 
drunk  and went back to Phil & Andy's cabine where all  the  beer 
was positioned.  I went back with about 15 of the cans (each  one 
of  them contains 1/2  a litre (by the way,  never ever  get  the 
beer  STELLA,  it  tastes like piss!!!!  but as we did  not  have 
anything else we had to put up with this stuff).  I then  decided 
to  go and nick some wine if Derek,  to my surprise I  was  quite 
succesfull   as   I   came  back  with  a  0.75   l   bottle   of 
LIEBFRAUENMILCH.  To  make a long story short,  all 5 of us  good 
drunk,  very drunk.  When we checked our drinks we realised  that 
there were only about 3 cans left. 
At about 3am I began to puke as it is not too good to mix  drinks 
(i.e.  Vodka,  Bulgarian wine,  beer,  Liebfrauenmilch...).  As I 
never could be bothered to go to the toilet I always vomitted out 
of the window (just imagine what a mess that makes when the train 
is moving !!!).
The next morning I got up with a massive hangover.....

At  the  station  we were then picked up by  Snake  and  Zae  who 
brought us to Fury's home. 

(This little  introduction was written when I was back in London, 
all  the following text is the real-time article except a  little 
bit at the end which I also had to add after I had returned!!)

Enjoy reading this Chaos...

                                        Sammy Joe signing off
  
      
Date: 21.7.90
Time: 10.02 am
Present:   Everybody  except  Omega,  Sync,  Carebears,  Tex,  ST 
           Connexion.....
People who are present:  ULM,  TLB,  NeXT, REPLICANTS, BBC, DEREK 
                         MD(the  one  who  wanted  a  BIG   MAC), 
                         AXE,  MYSTIC,  TGE,  AENIGMATICA, MOB, A 
                         GREAT  GRAPHIX MAN,  A GREAT SOUND  MAN, 
                         AND SOME OTHER'S TO WHOM I HAVEN'T BEEN 
                         INTRODUCED YET...

For my taste,  there are too many frogs around, but then again we 
are  in France.  This morning we were picked up from the  Station 
St.Charles by Zae and Snake (the one with the mega ultra enormous 
nose  (Hi  Derek)).  We then had to walk for 15 hours to  get  to 
Fury's  place(up a stupid hill!!!,  but there is a nice  swimming 
pool !!!!!!). At ten past 8 we were finally there and met up with 
all the guys mentioned above.  I will now pass the keyboard on to 
Fury (this was a LOST BOY typing):

Fury typing...
I  am sourrounded by PIGS (Derek MD),  they are all so  horrible, 
you  should  see  the way he eats his pizza (first  he  gets  the 
pizza,  then  empties a bottle of ketchup on it,  then some  more 
salt,  loads  of  pepper and vinegar.  He then folds  it  up  and 
squeezes  all in his mouth.  He was so kind afterwards  to  offer 
everybody  a  piece of his special half-eaten  pizza  with  extra 
saliva).

Here's Derek MD now trying to defend himself:         Hi, I am no 
pig really ,  I am just a real horrible monster.  I am not hungry 
no more,  I have gone of the pizzas for life.  I think (I  wonder 
how  he  thinks with no brain (Sammy Joe)) that Sammy  joe  is  a 
really handsome German person. If you want to get pissed and have 
a  good time (i.e.  chat up 17 year old girls!!) drink  Bulgarian 
wine and trying to beat up the BBC(especially the two ugly ones), 
the  Lawnmower artist and Joe 90 (no offence to you AXE) and  MOB 
(thank you for editing the Pompey Packer,  we have done them over 
mate).
                     Derek   signing   off    and    hopefully 
                     Later having a fuck (no chance (Sammy Joe)). 

Hi freaks, this is Axe of Delight typing at the keyboard.
Well,  I am tired right now,  after the journey, so I won't write 
too  much.  Sammy Joe typed Fury's and Derek's  lines,  so  don't 
blame him for being responsible for this shit. I just had 1 pizza 
(no more like other guys, like Derek).
France is great except for the long way we had to walk. Fury says 
that  it is not yet finished,  we will have to walk  more.  I  am 
happily  looking forward for that!!!!!!!!  <- This can be  packed 
very well, so I'll have some more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No more inspiration, so I'll leave you for now...

This  is Gunstick from Unlimited Matricks on the keyboard  typing 
some stuff.  After I heard that Derek had a nice meal I  straight 
went  into the kitchen and found that no more pizzas  were  left. 
And I saw a strange thing lying on Dereks plate. It looked like a 
pizza with some additional things on it ... That's all for now.

Andy  the Arfling here.Seems like it's my turn to slag off  Derek 
now! I won't exagerate though,I'll just describe him to you,think 
of a typical English soccer holigan, beer gut,that's Derek,what a 
sad case he is! Laters people.....

Derek's   currently   seeming   to   sleep,   hope   it'll   last 
long!!!!!!!!!!!  (Yeah!  I  was told this sign was well  packable 
!!!)                     Fury signing off (stinky keyboard!!!)

Time: 10.50 am

Chris of TGE is lost again and ZAE is now trying to find him, ZAE 
has no idea what Chris looks like, no idea in which train he will 
come,  so I personally I wish ZAE good luck!!!  As we have only 1 
ST  at the moment we can't do too much,  except showing  off  the 
various new demo screens,  new musix from Count Zero and  Chrispy  
Noodle.  These are the things we intend to do in the next week  : 
sleep,  drink, eat (sound pretty normal to me), go to the bitches 
(at  least that's what it said on the invitation(but we  have  to 
supply the condoms) !  Question;  How hot is it ?  Answer  :  27' 
degrees  celsius (too hot for me!!!) but then again  that's  what 
you have to expect when you go to Marseille. I was just told that 
it is going to be even hotter ! 

YUPPPPPPPPPPIE, Derek has gone to bed again, i.e. we can slag him 
off  again:  You big sucking laming half brained  Amiga  friendly 
bastard.  (That's  not true,  you know Sammy!  No more  uploading 
Maggie from now on unless you kiss my arse!    Derek!)

Does anybody know what 'LAMER' actually means ?  Here the defini-
tions from the various people sitting around me:

AXE  - a lamer is a guy who knows how to move a joystick and  how 
        to  insert  a disk and thinks he knows  everything  about  
       computers

Short  interruption here,  Zae's back with Chris of TGE and  some 
guy  from the Replicants.  Wir haben jetzt gerade  eine  deutsche 
Clique aufgemacht (AXE, TGE, TLB).

Second interruption:  ksvjhwuestfo”a<y (that was Snake  burping). 
Third  interruption:  some  lovely  girls are  currently  in  the 
swimming pool and everybody is running to the window......

Fourth    Interruption:     ”afgl„agnawetvg    (Snake     again!)  
                       Vertical Blank  RTE

End of these interruptions. Everybody is preparing to go swimming 
(guess why...) So I can continue where we stopped: The meaning of 
the word LAMER:

GUNSTICK  -  A lamer is someone talking about things  he  doesn't             
             understand  but thinking he does understand (  quite             
             complicated explanation ...)

(haha, Zae just hit his foot on The Pilot's ghettoblaster ...)

Yeah,  well all the others have fucked off to the pool for a swim 
(in some pussy).  This is The Pilot...  (Andy's sidekick), typing 
to  keep me awake,  cos conversation with MOB consists of  snores 
and  guttural  groans (and Andy is busy watching the  pussy  swim 
about  down below).  I suspect that a lot will written about  the 
train  journey here,  especially about Derek,  who threatened  to 
tear  Me,  Andy and MOB apart within about three seconds of  each 
other,  and  then swung at me,  but could not figure out  the  3D 
effect of me standing 2 feet away.  His 2D vision meant he hit  a 
window instead and then looked at my face still there with a look 
of pissed wonderment.  Sammy Joe is back flipping around the pool 
trying  to  impress  the  pussy (who have  just  vacated  on  the 
double). Still Sammy has plenty of blokes to choose from ???

  Derek is looking over my shoulder so I will be nice about  him. 
He is a very nice guy indeed (When sober). And a complete bastard 
when pissed on wine (especially 11% Bulgarian).
   I don't know half the guys here yet,  except Snake,  Zae, Del, 
Axe,  Andy (who's he??),  Sammy, MOB, Fury and umm.. , well there 
are some others who share my taste in people (Derek is an  animal 
Yah!!!).

  Yeah, well as Andy and I have taken to saying Laters People...

(See you on our next upload, and Big Smacks to Little LuLu).

And Derek says : Phil grow some hair quickly (typed by Phil).

Now we'll continue with the explanation of the word 'lamer'!

TGE - a lamer is somebody who tries to use the stack as a pointer 
      of the screenbase! 
Hey  guys,  we just were at the local swimming pool and we had  a 
lot of fun.  Snake is the new master of looping jumps. There were 
also  some  nice  girls who we'll meet tonight -  Axe  is  really 
looking forward to it; in fact we'll have to meet some nice stuff 
coz we played 'how long is your dong' to whole afternoon!!! 
FURY (back on the mater of lamers):
     Well, the best way to define a lamer is the guy who comes at 
     7  p.m.,  without any advice,  bores you to death during  at      
least 2 hours with non sense craptalk like: 'Hey! I've done
     a Fullscreen rout that's able to scroll as many 4  bitplanes 
     images as you want (and thats on a half meg),  at any speed, 
     using  the system routs at a speed of 50 frames  per  second 
     and  8 voices digisound over all,  and still have  processor 
     time' (seems to be a little weird but this is exactly what a 
     lamer of that kind told me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (yeah this 
     sign again!!!!!!!!  It still packs very well,  and the  more 
     you put it, the more it'll be packed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

     Anyway,  another  definition is the guy whose  knowledge  on 
     computers is limited to using a copier (the simplest specie) 
     and  having  a joystick tucked in  both  hands.  (Strangely, 
     Derek fits the bill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
     (That's bullshit! You french frog!    Derek!)

     Bye bye,  I'd better leave the room now,  before Derek comes 
     with his pizzas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Axe: A lamer is a guy who was not invited!!!!!!
     A lamer is a guy who thinks a plane is an aircraft!!!!!
     A lamer is a guy who thinks a sprite is something to drink!!
      A lamer is a guy who tells you that there could be  packers      
that can pack files to 1 byte!!!!


MOB: A lamer is a member of the Pompey Pirates!!

Derek MD: A lamer is a guy who does not like pizzas
          A lamer is a guy who has no modem and codes
          A  lamer  is  a  guy  who  collects  only  PD  Software 
          
Snake: A lamer is an Overlamers.

Well, I think that covers just about any person using a computer. 
But as Snake wants to use this ST here at the moment I have to go 
now, see you soon (in 5 minutes, no second later!!)...

OK,  here  we  go  again,  we  just had to have  a  look  at  the 
Automashun Menu 69 Part 5. We appear to be in a slagging off mood 
here, I have just been called a Lust Boy (sounds good!). Hey Lust 
Boy,  have you found your Lost Toy??  No, it's so dark in here, I 
am so lost.  Help me !!  What are you doing at the Post, Boy??? I 
am spending lodsa lost money.  If you are really bored now,  GOTO 
INTERESTING.        
Here's another Lamer definition:
A lamer is a guy who stands in a shop and types in the C64 :

               1: PRINT "I AM A LAMER"
               2: GOTO 1
               RUN
                              ?SYNTAX ERRRRRRRORRRRRR
And then has no idea how to stop it.

Here's some more infos, AXE has already done a new version of his 
Fire  Packer which I will hopefully include in one of the  future 
issues of maggie.  Manikin and Spaz (Tim and David) are currently 
programming a game for Thalion Software in Gutersloh.  They  game 
will  be  called  PREHISTORIC TALES and will be some  sort  of  a 
platform game.  Thalion has also two other games in the  pipeline 
like Wings of Death and Jambala II (both are very very good!!)
Currently we are in Fury's home and in a few days (2 in fact)  we 
will have to move again to the actual place for the Copyparty. 
DID  YOU KNOW THAT THE FROG KEYBOARD IS THE WORST IN THE WORLD  ? 
Well in case you did not, now you know !
And in case you knew it, you now know it too !  
l  -l  LTV9N8OP š+4  <- This was written by the feet of  Axe  and 
                        Snake.

Did you know that ...  ...  we are now copying the idea from  ST-
NEWS?
... this is very boring?
... I never liked this in ST-NEWS?
... I am doing it here anyway?
... I am doing this to annoy you?
... this could go on forever?
... this is only the first disk that we are writing stuff?
...  we  want  to break the world  record in length  of  bullshit         
writing?
... I was just kidding?
... or maybe not?
... this is currently Axe annoying you?
...  I  can only  write so much shit,  because we have  a  German     
keyboard here and it's the only one I am used to?
... Snake has a big nose?
... or maybe not?
... ...?
... ...! <- this ! can be packed to 1 byte.
... or maybe not?
... the "or maybe not?" can be packed very well?
... I am more bored doing this than you are right now?
... I will stop now?


Let's wrap!

The scrolline restarts now!

Aenigmatica and Galtan Six finally arrived at 5:00 pm. We are all 
very tired (no sleep for a long time and a long trip to get here) 
and it's very hot too.  There is some thermometer outside on  the 
wall  which says 26 degrees,  but I don't trust this shit  and  I 
think  that  there  are  rather  36  degrees  outside...  If  you 
shouldn't  know,  this is The Fate of Unlimited  Matricks  typing 
whole this shit and I don't want to bore you anymore,  so I leave 
the keyboard for some other people... bye bye....

Now  a little story about MIT of NeXT.  He's now sleeping  for  4 
hours.  The  funny thing is that he first slept on  the  canapee, 
then  one leg fell down,  and at this moment he's rather  on  his 
knees and still sleeping. I'll tell you when he finally be awaken 
(and in which position).

Time 17:20
Yeaaahh,  this  is Gunstick.  Finally some reorganisation of  the 
chaos at Fury's home.  Everybody has to move all his things in  a 
corner.  If  there is no more corner left ?  "Simply create  one" 
says Fury ...
MIT  changed  position:  he's now sitting on  the  canapee.  He's 
really  awaken  now.  But I'm tired.  Now  he's  sleeping  again. 
Strange guy ....

Fury just told me that the whole party will be made at his  home. 
And  as I'm typing this shit,  ULM will most probably get  a  bad 
place  (except if the people just looking at me typing this  give 
us  a place on a table ...) As usual The Fate doesn't care  about 
this  and  I'll have to listen the whole meeting  his  complaints 
about that shitty position he has to sit in front of his ST.

After about 10 hours of non-stop travelling,  3 cases of mistaken 
route-identity,  and  about 5847 more gray hairs expected at  the 
end of our lives,  we (at least 3 of us did initially) arrived at 
the NeXT/Replicants copy-party......  Snore ....  Sorry!  But the 
last.... 
Fifth  Interruption:  Volleyball:  Replicants/NeXT/MYSTIC vs  The 
Lost   Boys/The   Garlic  Eaters/AXE   of   delight.....   Result 
2:1........ Rematch Tomorrow..... Slaughter house warned....

Did  you  know  that when something can  go  wrong,  it  MUST  go 
wrong!!!!!   Well,   that's   exactly   what's   happening   now. 
                         Fury signing (if my parents know what's
                         happening, I'm DEAD!!!!)

A lamer is a lamer if he works on a computer that is standing  on 
a chair!!! What??? Me??? No, all others except me!!!

I  think  that  a  lamer is a guy who  passes  all  his  time  to 
critisize  the  work  (hard work!)  of  the  other  people,  says 
"Beuuurrkkk...  That's a very boring screen...  I'm sure that  it 
can  be possible to realised it in GFA basic 2.00  !...  In  fact 
this  guy is only a graphist (very boring graphist) from  a  very 
great  (!) french crew who don't know that the shadow is  at  the 
opposite side of the light !!!!  Oh it was Dbug from NeXT at  the 
keyboard.


Time: 11.43 pm
Hi,  it's  me again Sammy Joe of the Lost Boys,  we haven't  been 
writing  a  lot in the last few hours as we went  hiking  through 
Marseille trying to get to the  Mc Donalds.  There we ate a  lot, 
and I mean a lot.  On the way back AXE of Delight got  going,  he 
started and razed Marseille.  Well, first of all he began to tear 
down  various  posters from lampposts and then found  a  shopping 
trolley  in  which he travelled on (Snake tried to push  him  but 
gave  up after a short time).  AXE got really pissed off when  we 
had  to  climb the hill back to our apartment and  began  to  let 
steam  off by kicking some poor lamp posts.  He kept  on  kicking 
them until they just went off...  He was pretty lucky that he did 
not get busted as there were some police men watching  him...  We 
have  now  decided to start a demo which should  be  finished  on 
time,  i.e. before this copy party ends. If it is not going to be 
finished,  it will never be done (What a shame eehh ?  ) The demo 
will consist of a 4 track tune by Chris, Overscan by ULM and some 
more  sprites by whoever will do them and not to forget  a  great 
reset by our lovely little friend Phil of BBC. 
While  I  was typing this here a competition took  place  in  the 
kitchen which looks like a mess now... 
1st Competition:  Stacking pot noodles on top of each other in  a 
                  weird angle
the Winner: Mob
the Loser : Axe

2nd  Competition:  a  counting  game in which  the  loser  drinks 
beer,the  first  person starts with  number 1  and  continues  in 
sequence but number 7 and multiples of this are not allowed.
      the winner: Andy the 'arfling
the loser : Axe

.....ahem!  Yes?  ok,  As I,  The Nutty Snake of AEnigmatica, was 
telling  you  BEFORE I got interrupted by I-  Interrupt  #5...II- 
Fury and III- Sammy Joe. Well, with these 'Interrupting' elements 
removed from my vicinity, I can go on with my story....  the last 
30+  hours were quite sleepless for me,  so I am nearly  bouncing 
out of my chair,  and into my (not made yet) bed.  Our  adventure 
starts at the junction at Utrecht to 's Hertogenbosch in Holland, 
where  the  two cars we were driving  lost  each  other.  Finally 
arriving  in  's Hertogenbosch we collected the  two  members  of 
Galtan 6 who would come with us to Marseille.  After making  some 
arrangements  about what to do if we lost each  other  again,  we 
drove off....  one car to the left,  and one straight  forward... 
Thus we lost each other again,  and this separation lasted  until 
the  Beligian-French  border  (about 2  hours  later).  Again  we 
promised not lose each other, but yes, yes... about 5 hours later 
we  had to pass a toll-gate,  which took a little more time  than 
the  other car.....  we lost each other again....  and  saw  each 
other again only in Marseille.

Thus   end  the  never-ending  chronicles  of   the   Aenigmatica 
Adventuring  Party,  consisting this week  of:  Zanac,  ZoKathRa, 
Crush, and The Nutty Snake (your chronicler).
 Sixth Interruption:  Some unknown members of the Replicants/NeXT 
party have just left the premises in search of... GIRLS!
Good luck guys....

Time: 00:24 (european notation!)

The  Nutty  Snake  is behind the rattleboard  again,  and  he  is 
complaining:  Where  is the food?  I just brought in  some  large 
crates  with foodstuffs,  and they seem to have disappeared  into 
the kitchen!  An expedition consisting of me....er yes,  is going 
to explore the food-case. Further reports will follow.

Time: 00:28 (EP)

This is Crush.  I was going to get a beer for me and TNS but when 
I got to the kitchen all my beer was gone! These people sure know 
what's good for them.  TNS just returned with a disappointed look 
on  his face so I guess that his journey was in  vain.  The  last 
time I slept was,  by the way, about 42 hours ago so I think it's 
time that I got some sleep. The only trouble is that I don't know 
where  I'm gonna sleep because we're a little bit short on  space 
here...

Time: 7.37 (Sammy Joe)

Hi  dudes,   I  am  really  pissed  off.   Have  a  guess  why  ? 
..................  About  3 hours ago I went to sleep  and  some 
bastard  has now decided that I should not have my  beauty  sleep 
(not that I really need it) anymore and turns on his ST. And now, 
here's an even harder question : What tune is he playing ? It had 
to be Count Zero's tune from Maggie,  as if I haven't heard  that 
long  enough now.  Some guys who did not go to sleep  managed  to 
slow  down the 4 track routine but our lovely little Chris did  a 
nice preview piece for the demo.  I think that I should pass  the 
keybaord  on  to  another person (who's pissed off  too)  who  is 
eagerly awaiting his turn to let off some steam....

Good (too early) morning!  As Sammy Joe just said,  it must  have 
been  the music that was playing at about pneumatic-hammer  level 
just 2 metres away that might have awoken us... Well, I hope that 
the very, VERY irritating key-click from this Atari will irritate 
those loud-players,  and loud-speakers. I, The Nutty Snake of AE-
fame (I hope),  am somewhat luckier as I have slept from about  5 
hours ago till now. 
'whurghu?' - 1.  Expression of a just awoken, and probably stone-
pissed Atari-freak.  2. Rare species of plants found only deep in 
the Amazon forests,  which has the properties of totally removing 
the  alcohol contents from the imbibers blood.  The side  effects 
however are nausea,  headaches, and a distinct feeling as if your 
tongue was made of leather/sandpaper/something else which doesn't
