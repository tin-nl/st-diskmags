--- DIM from OVERLANDERS (SYGMA FORCE) --- 27/08 -- 9:38:17' 34'' PM

     Hello guys... Here I am writting for the first time in this 
article. I wanted to a few days ago, but I didn't feel (I think)
writting more than what I was doing for some line-routs (which 
are quite fast; I mean they could be of the best, but there still 
are some things to do). By the way, I've been learning some 3D
techniques (not filled, don't dream) for 2 or 3 days. As I have
not all the mathematical notions for it, I would have to study
those techniques to understand them well. In fact, Crystar of 
Pendragons gave me his ideas and techniques, I gave him my line-
routine (witch can draw about 13 lines of 320x200 each VBL), and
my optmisations. We just have done a 3D-line animation pretty 
fast but we don't have optimized the animation-techniques.
     Well. I was without my ST for about a month and a half, just
before the Convention. So I didn't really feel coding at the 
beginning. I had a screen to do, it isn't finished yet (I worked 
just for 2 days for it). It would be a fullscreen with hardware-
scroller of 256 lines height, with a Wizball-sprite of more than
200x200 (I can't remember), and, if possible, with digi-
soundtrack. And now only the scroller is done. The sprite is 
really terrible to optimise, and as I don't want to optimise it
bit by bit, I think I'll make a program to do it. The lone 
problem is in the fact that I really don't want to do it during 
the Convention. 
     I've seen some finished screens from Mister Bee, Adso, 

Pendragons, Ziggy Stardust... All are really good!! And what is 
terrific (at least, for me) is that some were done in the first 
days of the Convention! That means, I don't feel coding many 
hours a day, so I haven't (for now) a large productivity, I just 
hope to code faster when I'll be back.
     Now stop writting about my life!
The Convention is really (that means R-E-A-L-L-Y) cool, 
delirious! Sometimes there are some water-huntings, where 
every guy goes down in the washtub. And, as I have (once again)
taken precautions, I brought my camera, and managed to take 
photos of everyone (even of me!!) in the water. Well, I just say 
that it was a really good idea to make everyone going into the 
watertub!!     Perhaps in a future screen, you will see some of 
those cliches...
     Okay. I saw that Dogue made a very big logo. No problem.
                         Just see.....

     Well, okay, I stop here, otherwise all the others will kill 
me! (they don't want big logos anymore!!!). In fact, I was 
supposed to write in big-logo: "DIM FROM SYGMA FORCE OF THE 
OVERLANDERS"...).  So you see, there are 50 missing print-
screens to see all the real logo!

     Crazy, no?

     Okay, let's wrap...   NOW!!!


-------------- DOGUE DE MAUVE from OVERLANDERS ----------- 05.00 PM
 
Yes, it's me again, at the same hour... Well, in fact, we're now 
28/08/90! We had a very turbulent night, in fact. We first 
watched BEETLEJUICE, a very nice & delirious film by Tim BURTON 
then we had good time with ROBOCOP, great film, too. Of course, 
since I remain as serious and as reasonnable as you know, I 
decided to go to bed. Unfortunately, the PENDRAGONS had to pack
their luggages (with Huffman algorythm!) and they disturbed me by 
putting the light on and walking through the attic. A few minutes 
later, a few guys came, intending to disturb the PENDRAGONS. The 
whole attic was quickly filled by some crazy shouting barbarians 
fighting eachothers. Pillows, sleepbags and mattress were flying 
through the air. I desesperately tried to calm everybody but they 
didn't want to stop. I finally had to fight them myself, using my 
"FORCE MAUVE" suit (in fact, my mauve sleepbag) and all my tired 
power... Four or five guys tried to catch me, intending to tickle 
me. I resisted and three of them are now in hospital...
That was really tiresome! When we finally stopped this terrible 
war, it was 4.45 AM and the PENDRAGONS had to get up at 6.00 AM 
and leave at 8.00 AM. Of course, these stupid boys didn't try to 
be discreet. They took a big cooking-pot and drummed against it 
like mad musicians. An AWFUL noise!!! They even managed to damage 
the pot!!! Dumb brains!!!
In fact, it's a pity that they left us. These guys are very cool, 
actually. They are our best friends in France (they aren't 
pretentious, nor jealous; they're good coders and very pleasant
and funny boys).
OK, let's talk about the present time. Most of us are now playing 
various games ("TECH" on AMIGA -a kind of TRON-, "CHAOS STRIKES 
BACK" on ST -a kind of Shoot'em up-, "SUPER SPRINT" on ST -a sort 
of mindboggling game- and "QUARTZ" -a very nice adventure game I 
played a few minutes before-).
This no more a coding-party but a playing-party. I must say we 
all worked quite hard (I even programmed ASSEMBLER! Yes, 
ASSEMBLER!!!) and we now need to rest a bit... 
Well, FURYO needs his "SUPER SPRINT" dose or he will die. I'll 
stop 'coz I don't want to be considered as a murderer.

                                                        "See" ya!
                                                    DDM (5.40 PM)

------------------ Ziggy STARDUST from OVERLANDERS ------------- 00.00 PM

Ok! For the first time, and surely the last, I write in this 
article. I didn't write before because I was too busy! Not busy to 
code anything, but to play to various game. I stop now, because 
it's too easy, I always win! Ha ha ha!! It's really hard to code 
here, because every member make some "music-war", which means that 
they try to put the volume of their ST at the maximum. The result 
is that I even can't hear myself thinking. Well, in fact, it's 
not a bad thing, because I feel very lazy, those last time. WE 
ARE ON HOLIDAY!!! Well, in fact, not for a long time. GGGRRR! 
Don't laugh, Adso, that's not funny! (He goes back to school just 
in more than one month!). With Humungus, I'v done some pretty 
nice 3D forms animations. It's very funny! I want make rebound every 
object, even the car and the space craft. I don't understand  
why, Humungus does not agree with this movement.

Arf arf!!! Pib has just been thrown to the washtub! Poor little 
guy! It's very cold, because we are in moutains, at 1200 meters 
high! I've already be thrown in the wasthub two time. Well, I 
must say that this convention is completly delirious, sleeping 
here is very difficult! Anyway, it seems that more I sleep, more 
I'm tired. The only thing I've done here, is including the line 
rout of Dim in my filled vector routs, and now, my routs are 
completly bugged! Arrrg! I have no .BAK!! Ok, bye everybody! We 
come back home in two days.

     BBBBBB    Y     Y  EEEEEEEEE    
     B     B    Y   Y   E
     B     B     Y Y    E
     BBBBBB       Y     EEEEE

     BBBBBB       Y     EEEEEEEEEE   . . . . . .


------- DOGUE DE MAUVE from OVERLANDERS ------- 18.47 PM (31/9/90)

Yeah! I'm back in town (I mean in ASNIERES, were I live) and I'm 
supposed to tell you what we did the last two days. The 
convention ended the 29/9/90. In the morning, we received a 
journalist who wanted to know what we were doing and perhaps make 
an article about our convention. We showed him our last demos & 
game previews and explained who we were and what we were doing 
here. He took a few pictures from us, too. Well, let's hope we'll 
be able to get this article quickly...
Just before leaving, a few guys were thrown in the washtub again 
(good luck that it was hot). Then, two pretty taxi-girls came to 
drive us to the station (all the others seemed to find this women 
wonderful but I thought they were not that beautiful in fact).

After the convention, we (I, HUMUNGUS, ADSO, GUDUL, LUDUG, ZIGGY, 
FURYO & STAN MERCURY) decided to go to the AQUA-SOMETHING (a kind 
of giant swimming-pool with jaccuzi, "waving pool", fountains, 
hot "bubbling" water and so on... We even had great time in a 140 
meters high toboggan (nearly all, 'coz STAN was frightened and 
HUMUNGUS didn't want to loose his lenses). Great, actually, 
especially when I loose my "swimming carpet", heard FURYO 
shouting 10 meters behind me in the tunnel and had to hurry to 
avoid a terrible crush (he's quite a big guy, you know!).
A very funny afternoon!
But we had to leave in the evening... OVERLANDERS go home!

I would like to thanx and congratulate again FURYO & STAN MERCURY 
who organized this great "BEACH PARTY" (where's the beach?). A 
special thought for STAN who's leaving for army...
Thanx to all inhabitants in the village and to STAN's and FURYO's 
parents who accomodated us very kindly.

That's all for this time. 
                                                 "See" you soon &
                                       May the MAUVE be with you!

patient. Thanx.
