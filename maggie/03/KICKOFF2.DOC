The first thing you notice about Kick Off 2 is how long it  takes 
to  load.  After  more  than a minute of  waiting  you  are  then 
presented  with  a rather poor title screen.  It is  after  this, 
however  that  things begin to change.  Initialy there  are  nine 
options to choose from, including practice, league, int. friendly 
and  the cup.  Before starting a match you can go to  an  option, 
called  options (how strange) and set out the parameters for  the 
match.  You  have  a  choice of  pitch  (normal,  wet,  soggy  or 
plastic),  length of match,  referee and a choice of whether  you 
want extra time and nail biting penalties or not.  There is  also 
an  ingenuous function called "After touch" which allows  you  to 
control  the  direction of the ball slightly for a  split  second 
after you have kicked the ball.  This means that you can do weird 
and  wonderful  things with the ball like curling  it  round  the 
goalie or putting the ball in the top corner of the net on a  set 
piece.
If you load up this game for the first time and start a game with 
out  setting paremeters then the game will probably go  something 
like this:
"Holy fuck ah shit oh bugger, damn!" 1-0 down. 
This is because the game is very (and I do mean very!) fast.  But 
never fear because help is here!  All you need to do is put  your 
teams  skill up to int.  level and put the comps.  team  down  to 
fourth  div.  skill.  If you still find the game play to fast  to 
begin  with,  then why not change the speed of the game to 50  or 
even  25%?  There are so many functions that you could try a  new 
combination of them each day for the rest of you life!
Grafixxxxxxxx are small but well defined (were have I heared that 
before?) and,  as I have said before,  the gameplay is very fast. 
At  the back of you defence you have an acrobatic goalie who  one 
minute  can be doing dives twice the length of the goal to  do  a 
save an the other can be letting a ball slip through his legs.  I 
am  glad to say that he usually does the former though.  The  top 
and bottom borders are plain green while the side borders  scroll 
light  and dark like the rest of the screen.  This gives  a  good 
impression  of  playing in the borders as you usually  only  have 
enough  time  to  glance at them.  However  when  you  look  more 
closely you notice that neither the players or the white lines on 
the  pitch ever appear in this area.  The idea still  works  well 
though and while you are playing a game you really feel like  you 
are using the whole screen.
Sound is excellant with sampled wistles, cheers and boos from the 
crowd.  Things  seem more tense when an "ooohhh" comes  form  the 
spectators  as  you  step up to take a  vital  penalty.  I  think 
perhaps there could be some noise from the crowd in ordinary play 
but apart from this I have little complaints. 
With a quick read of the instructions manual you can play a  game 
straight  away. Simple moves come instinctively but  things  like 
scissor kicks take a bit of getting used to.
As  soon as you press the fire button to start a  game,  gameplay 
jumps  up  and grabs you by the throat.  I was playing  at  least 
three  games  a day for the first two weeks.  After a  while  you 
playing  the comp.  becomes less fun and it is then you  turn  to 
face a human oponant. Theres nothing like scoring a goal, hearing 
the  crowd  roar and then looking acroos and  seeing  you  friend 
eating his joystick in anger.
Anyway,  you have probably skipped this review so you can get  to 
the ratings at the end and here they are:

    GRAFIXXXX:81% Small but they do the job.
    SOUND:91%
    VALUE FOR MONEY:95%
    INSTANT APPEAL:95%
    LONG TERM INTEREST:90%
    GAME PLAY:96%
     ABILITY  OF DISK TO WITHSTAND MICHAELANGELO JUMPING  UP  AND 
DOWN ON IT:2% 
    OVERALL:95%

I haven't seen MIDWINTER or ANARCHY yet and I don't know  whether 
they  will change my mind but at the moment I would have  to  say 
that  this is the best game I have seen on the ST ever.  It is  a 
smidgen better than DAMOCLES (see my short review,  if I've  done 
it).  Buy  KICK  OFF 2 or set light to your under  pants  in  the 
middle  of  Trafalger  Square.  This is the  first  time  I  have 
borrowed  a game of some one and thought it was so good I had  to 
buy   it  straight  away.   And  if  you  think  it's  just   me, 
MICHAELANGELO did exactlly the same thing when he saw it!

Kick of 2,has to be one of the best football games around because 
it takes the piss out of kick off...(Uh, what is this guy talking
about?-Don).

P.S. Don here again, just to say that I've got Midwinter now  but 
I haven't really got into it yet so I'm not sure wether I like it 
or not.
