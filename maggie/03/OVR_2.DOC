
Part II:

---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 4.22 A.M

It is a bit late, and I'am very tired, so I will go to bed now.
Bye for this morning, and CU soon.


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 12.06 P.M 

YEAH!!! I just going up, and like I don't know what to do, I 
write here... Oh, just one thing: the screen of the PENDRAGONS 
for the EUROPEAN DEMOS is finished without the shadow of a 
bugs... It is super! 
     

----------------- CPT BUG FROM BANANA CLUB -----------12.30 PM

Heeee I've forgotten to write something in this text
these night. Well,Typhon, Speed, Mad Man haven't slept and I  
am very tired but I'll sleep the next night( yes it is sure).
I'm hungry!!!! Typhon have ended his screen and me mine.It is 
a good day for banana (and OVR) because the two bugs coders of
B.Club are us. Now I'll eat!!!!. Cool

---- TERENCE from 'The crew ev'rybody talk about' ---- 1.01 PM

Hi boys ! This party is really boring !! Even if Speedlight looks 
a lot like one, there's no girl at this party  !!! Only Madman 
show his erotic phantasm by animating some teenage queen pictures 
at a so quick speed that it looks completely bugged. And Madman 
dares to say, after that, that he is able to make good animation!
 
Dogue is now trying to find all his clothes all around the 
room. Some clothes are on the window since the bath we took in the 
basin. And nobody asked for them. I'm nearly sure they belong to 
Humungus (who is still sleeping now). I don't know what we've 
done to the motherfucker overlamers but they spend their time 
fucking us. I think I would soon join Next and Snake even if I 
will be then said to be a child (as Snake and Zae seem to be). 
But I don't care, I would really enjoy fucking Dogue de morve who 
is now reading what I write (NFDDM: and correcting incessants 
mistakes!!!). That ain't true. Dogue de morve is a liar as Stan 
the little brain. I'm a so good coder that I can't make any 
english mistakes. And Dogue de morve is a small shit ST-Basic 
coder. Many people claim that the Ultimate Gfa Demo was made in 
Assembler. They're totally wrong. It was made in pure ST-Basic 
code. I'm not sure you can imagine how easy it is to code in ST-
Basic. There are so few instructions that it's simple to code in 
ST-Basic (about 1000 instructions in assembler, around 2^-12 in 
ST-basic !!!!).
In fact the real story is that Juimmau Lepinpec, a friend of 
ours, did code long ago all the Ultimate Gfa Demo but in ANSI 
Cobol 74. And as Dogue de Mauviette was really impressed (in fact a 
little something impress him ) and as he lacks programming 
skills he just converted it in ST-Basic. Now you know the whole 
story (Eh Krueger ! Are you happy ? You were right ! This was not 
GFA !!! Arf Arf Arf !!! We wonder if you're able to do all they 
made in GFA, even if you code in assembler !! Vodka is not good 
for you !!).


------------- STAN MERCURY of The OVERLANDERS -------- 1.34 PM  

     Hi, this is my last day in this great "BEACH PARTY" (sniff). 
I prepare the second volume of the compil code with sources of 
the screens in "THE DELIRIOUS DEMO 2" and "THE ULTIMATE GFA 
DEMO". If you want this compil contact us or "DEMO CITY" in 
England, and in the future to "THE LOST BOYS".

     Ok, Overlanders prepare "THE EUROPEAN DEMOS" too, but the 
coding is not finished at this time (sooorrryyyy !), please "BE 
PATIENT  !!!".

                                   To be continued...


-------------- SILVER from PENDRAGONS    ---------- 3.10 PM

Hello! Hello everybody! I have just beat ADSO at TWINTRIS on 
Amiga: It is really a very very good game. So I want to send 
a little message all over the world: "PLEASE IS THERE A GOOD
MIND WHO COULD ADAPTED TWINTRIS ON ST ". That is all. 
I also wanted to give a bad point to STAN MERCURY because few 
weeks ago I have invited him to spend few days with me in 
TIGNES. And in first he was agree but 3 days before he phoned
to inform me that he can not come because of his work: some firms
have burned. Poor SILVER who must wait more times to see him 
again. Snif... Sniff... But now I am here (in this fabulous OVR
convention ) and I can say you that the organization is really
extraordinary. This is the first time that I can sleep in this 
type of meeting.
Tuesday I must leave all the great friends. sniff... But I must 
take some food. I hope that there is enough food for us because
all the chips have been eaten by FURYO and all the drunk by all
expect me. Is it normal. I do not think. So now I must go to make 
my stock.
Oh!!! I have just finished to read my message and I am very to 
surprised because I have written 18 lines and I must say to 
everybody that is a new record for me. So I am going to 
omologue it immediatly. 
Now I must quit you to join Humungus, Dogue de mauve and Adso who 
wanted to beat me at TWINTRIS (poor guys).
Good bye!

         Silver


---------------- FURYO from OVERLANDERS ------------ 4.28 P.M

Just some words: BEE BOP ALULA...


---------------- TERENCE from OVERLANDERS ---------- 11.28 P.M

Oh I made a mistake, I wrote 'from OVERLANDERS'. Ev'rybody here 
write from OVERLANDERS that made me write this. Let's change 
that.


---------------- TERENCE from PENDRAGONS ------------ 11.29 P.M

All right now it's more clear and true. Many guys are now 
watching a film called 'WALL STREET". Captain Bug is looking to 
his straight 8 pixels scrolling with a great satisfaction ! GUDUL 
and HUMUNGUS are playing Wing of Fury on Amiga . They are very 
happy that I made a trainer on it : life and ammo unlimited. The 
great beautiful young DIM is coding something I always can't see 
from here. Wait a while I will ask him what it is.I'm back; He was 
working on the 3D vector graphics. It seems to be very fast. He 
develloped it with CRYSTAR because he was very interested in 
leanrning 3D technics. And he seems to learn all this 
mathematical theory very very quicly. Ah, HUMUNGUS and GUDUL came 
back to Twintris. And ZIGGY seems to be bored by the film, he is 
now watching them play. 
I think that HUMUNGUS should have take his christian name as 
pseudo. His real name is VLADIMIR. That sounds very pleasant 
because of all the thinks that happened in USSR and in the 
eastern countries. So VLADIMIR I require that you change your 
pseudo to your first name. If you don't do it I will fuck you until 
the sun explodes!!! 
I would like to say a little word about ZIGGY. I think he's 
really a great coder and I want to say it. He's a very cool guy 
too and is not proud as people like Manikin are. He's always 
ready to explain me how he does everything. He works on 3D 
routines and this time his work will really reflect his 
real coding level. His previous screens were very good but when 
you know him, you then realize that he is far away from us, as 
NICK of TCB. I would be very pleased if ZIGGY could write 
something here. HEY man you're the best but stop coding for a while 
and talk a bit to your fans!!! 
I made more lines than SILVER. Hope he will try to beat me on the 
keyboard and not on TWINTRIS.

---------------- GUDUL from GUDUL CORP. ------------ 0.20 A.M

Hello 'vrybody ... I just realised that it was really hard to 
write a text (I mean to type on the keyboard) and eating an 
orange in the same time... At the present moment we can saw ZIGGY 
on the AMIGA comppppppppppppppppppppppppp (sorry a piece of orange 
was falling on a key and my finger were stick on it) so I saw 
ZIGGY on the AMIGA computer but don't worry isn't coding anything 
he only try to beat his best score which is aproximately 210 
points and every people in the room and who are watching T.V. 
heard him crying 'Oh quelle malchance!!!' in english 'What a 
bad luck'. Hum STAN said that we don't have to speak about the 
probleme of the crew in our text but there is a big problem in 
the GUDUL CORP. : I begins to feel fed up with the only member 
of this crew named GUDUL coz he is always hungry and every times 
he try to take something to eat he is hit by FURYO who said 
'if you continue to eat so much we don't have anymore food in 2 
days' hum I think that I'll delete this message coz he is just 
behind me. rahhhhhhhh he is hurting my nice face......
10 minutes later wake up once again, nothing to say coz my jaw 
have been destroyed....

------------------ Captain Bug from Banana Club -------- 1.30 A.M

He you gudul, you take a lot of place.I think you've got the
biggest logo of this texte.Good now in the room there isn't
many personns because furyo taked some biscuits and run away
so the other decided that he didn't eat all the biscuits. After
that other persons take other biscuits and run out from the room
(there is a disease). After these think a lot of persons go out
when they come back they're look tired because they run.
I think they're most mad than hungry.(Gudul ask me to come with 
him but I don't think if I go with him).They're boring me and I 
think I'll go to bed,hello and don't follow rude boys (????).


------------------- CRYSTAR from PENDRAGONS ------------ 1.50 AM

Ok, we are going to search NEMROD and FURYO which have gone away 
in the strange night for 10 minutes. But we are going to find 
them... and to kill them of course!
The 3D vector we have coded with DIM will certainly be completed 
tomorrow. We have compared the current version with the MCODER's
one and it seems to be the same quality. In fact, this routine
has been made to explain to DIM what the 3D is because we are
going to developped a 3D full faces ourselves. 
Because we (The PENDRAGONS) have developped a 3D full faces but 
it isn't as good as the ones of ZIGGY or MCODER and we think we 
can do a very good 3D if we made this rout ourselves.
Goodbye, it is time to go to kill NEMROD & FURYO.

------------------ CRYSTAR from PENDRAGONS -------------- 2.28 AM

We have gone to search them for 45 minutes now and we haven't 
found them for the moment. In fact, we have conceived to group to 
find them and we are 3 there. But we are going to search them 
back.
          to be continued...


------------- NEMROD & FURYO from TRITON --------------- 2.45 A.M

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!! Those lamers didn't manage to find us 
(in fact becoz we are a sort of half-god!). They are really bad, 
really quiet (they shout like pigs in the whole village), that's 
why we haven't any problem for hidding ourselves. We have time 
for speaking and digest our biscuits. (very good biscuits, eh eh 
eh!). We are really happy coz the purpose of the pursuit was to 
throw the looser(s) in the basin, so we think that we will have 
some very good time this morning (coz it is too late for doing it 
now, and one of our neighbours just come for saying that we made 
too much noises).

Bye for now, and see ya soon for explain you the wonderful 
morning of the loosers...(ah eh eh uh uh eh ah ah oh oh!!!).

--------------- PIB from SYGMA FORCE of OVERLANDERS ---- 3.20 A.M

Hey FURYO it won't be a wonderful morning , it will be a wet 
morning , so I will put on my BAT-kway because FURYO & NEMROD
will put our in the little wattering place , very cold in the 
morning. Now I will tell you goodbye because I want to prepare my 
wet morning with a little BAT-sleeping.
 
So   BAT-bye  , good BAT-night !!!

--------------- GUDUL from  ANTI-NEMROD&FURYO CREW ---- 3.56 A.M

I don't want to go in water! Please, help me!!!
hehehe in fact I think that they can't put us in water coz they 
are only 2 against 10 other persons arf arf arf if they try to 
touch me I just have to ask for other persons's help but I don't 
know if anyone will come coz FURYO is taller and stronger than 
every other added. They think that they can eat biscuits without 
being punished!!!
I hope you have noticed that PIB was totaly affected by the 
BATMANIA he talks in the BAT-LANGUAGE it a very simple language 
you just have to put a BAT before each word of the sentences, example:
I'm BAT-going to BAT-go to my BAT-bed.

     This is the BAT-LOGO-GUDUL

------------- DOGUE DE MAUVE from OVERLANDERS --------- 5.00 PM

FURYO says it's 4.59 PM but my own watch shows 5.01 PM. Well, I 
write 5.00 so that everybody will be happy (did you notice I 
didn't type "ev'ybody" or "evr'body" even if all the guys outta 
here try to look cool by copying TERENCE's way of speaking 
english). 

OK, let's speak about this morning... Full of events, actually!
Since I am quite a serious (???) and reasonable guy, I went to 
bed just after WALL STREET (cool film). But the others staid 
downstairs and I could hear them yelling, laughing and key 
clicking. And just when I fall asleep, two or three stupid boys 
put the light on and began to shout in my ears... Since 
I am quite a serious and reasonable boy, I didn't hit them and 
tried to stay in a good mood, even if I hate being waken up.
Fortunately, they quickly went away, probably 'coz they feared my 
powerful fists (they all call me "FORCE MAUVE", you know!).

A few minutes later, I heard them shout again... Something about 
FURYO and biscuits... Everybody seemed to fight to get some 
biscuits (those dumb brains had forgot that there were two other 
biscuit packs in the cupboard). I heard a nasty noise when FURYO 
smashed the skull of ZIGGY (or perhaps was it only a door 
slamming?). Then, everybody went out and I heard some very 
strange noises on the roof at the same time. I told myself that 
some E.T bug-eyed-young-demo-coders-killers-monsters were on the 
roof and intended to make a hole in the roof and take me to their 
spaceship (they probably wanted one of the best coders ever).
In fact, the thing was only that FURYO and NEMROD ran away from 
the house with all biscuits and the others wanted to hunt them 
down and get the precious food back. Quite uneasy to sleep with 
all those stupid boys running around, exploring the attic and 
even my sleepbag to find 'em. 
It seems that FURYO and NEMROD hide in the little village and the 
others tried in vain to find them. I finally fell asleep... and 
was waken up again by some STUPID FUCKING SHITTY DUMBHEAD freaks 
(also called GUDUL, XRAY and PIB). This time, I shouted a bit 
'coz I was sleepy and fed up at the same time! As they are some 
serious and reasonable (???) anyway, they stopped quickly and I 
could sleep a few minutes later... to be waken up again!!!
This time, it was 12.45 PM. FURYO and NEMROD had come to get PIB 
out of his bag and throw him in the washtub. The poor guy was 
completely sleepy and didn't want to go in a 8øC water 
immediately. Unfortunately, the cruel FURYO and NEMROD didn't 
leave him alone and actually throw him in this iced water.
A few minutes later, everybody (except the guy with his powerful 
fists & a few other luckily guys who didn't take part to the 
stupid HUNT'EM DOWN game) swimmed in the cold washtub.  
We finally decided that we needed a photo from everybody in the 
"BEACH PARTY", with sea, sex and sun... huh... no... I mean: 
cold water, clunched smiles and hidden sun. We managed to get 
everybody in the cold water at the same time and DIM took some 
pictures. Perhaps will you be able to see it in our next 
OVERLANDERS HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Pretty horrible, actually...
OK, that's all for this time. I'm going to leave the keyboard to 
the next guys (I've got a phone call to give...).

                                                          See ya!
                                                   DDM (5.59 PM)

Well, I will spare you the "DE MAUVE" 'coz it would probably be a 
bit boring and waste too much space on the MAGGIE disk (but, 
well, the LOST BOYS said they wanted lotsa big articles to fill 
their disk and I think they will appreciate all my efforts...).


See you later, with something a bit more interesting (I hope so, 
anyway!).

     Hello... Here I am again... I am preparing a Big screen for 
the European Demos and I'm fed up with so many bugs... But I 
don't give up because if I success this screen will be really 
great... I hope it'll be faster to finish the demo but I doubt!
You'll see what about I am speaking in the European-Demos and i'm
sure you'll not regret it!!!!
     Ciao....  See you soon.....
