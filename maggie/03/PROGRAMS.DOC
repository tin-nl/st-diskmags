                         BY THE GERMAN

Well,  I bet you wondered why I am using two disks for the  third 
issue ?  It is pretty simple,  I could not fit everything on  one 
disk  !  In  this  article I will tell you  a  little  about  the 
programs/sources  etc.  which  you will be able to  find  in  the 
folder PROGRAMS on disk 2.


BOOTSECTOR:
This is a little utility written by the Oberje of the  Fingerbobs 
which  puts some pretty nice bootsectors onto your  disks.  There 
are bootsectors like :  star field, colour bars, sprites and many 
more !


BYTEBENDER:
As the bytebender sources by the Watchmen was not quite  complete 
in the last issue,  I have included it again,  but this time with 
all the files.


THE EMPIRE NOISE TRACKER:
This is a great Tracker send to me by the Empire. Apparently this 
is  an exact convertion of the Noise Tracker on the  Amiga  !  My 
verdict is: GREAT TRACKER (full review next issue).


FONTS
These  here are some pretty good fonts ported from the  Amiga  by 
Alastair Craig.


MINDBOMB:
This is a program written by Ford Perfect to display screens from 
the Mindbomb demo individually.  This will enable the people  who 
were not able to look at the demo so far to do it now !


SCROLL_GFA:
The  source  belongs  to the article by Dogue de  Mauve  in  this 
issue.


STE TRACKER:
This is the source code for a 4 channel tracker for the Amiga (it 
belongs to the article by MCS).


MUSIC GFA:
This also belongs to the article in this issue !


HATE_VIR.TOS
This  is  a bootsector program written by Mad Vision.  I  am  not 
quite sure what it does as I did not have the time to try it out!
But i suppose that it will immunize your bootsector.


CHEATD.PRG
When  somebody send me this program I thought that it  was  quite 
good  so I copied it into the Programs folder,  and now 2  months 
later, I have totally forgotten what the program does !


This  is  a message to all the people out there who  code  little 
programs  like this one,  PLEASE SEND THEM TO US SO THAT  WE  CAN 
MAKE MAGGIE AS LARGE AS THIS ONE !!
