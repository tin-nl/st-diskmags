
                         Yo' Atarifreaks,

Here is a article from Slimer of the D.B.A.!
Sammy Joe asked me to write a article for the magazine(in fact 
he bribed me). I have refused to write a article for them(as you 
can see). Well, a man's got to do what a man's got to do(our 
something like that). First I want to give some compliments to 
the Lost Boys for there great magazine(it's the best)and for a 
job well done on the Mindbomb Demo(it's only a little bit better
than the D.B.A. demo). You guys are just great(slime slime).
Let me tell you something about the D.B.A.! We are a demo writing
and swapping group. The group contains 6 members:Slimer,Vigo,Ecto
1,Bonus,K.G.E. and Andre the Giant. Bonus and K.G.E. are the coders
and the rest are swappers(I'm doing the P.R. for the group).
We have made just two demo's so far(D.B.A. demo 1 and the Batman
demo classic).

If you want to know more about us, you just have to get your hands
on one of the demo's.

Now let's do some serious talking,

I have been reading those articles about FAST(great guys). Those 
guys are real lamers because they offer œ1000 to betray your fellow
Atarifreaks who copy pirated software. This is a very low 
advertising campaing don't you think !!?? This proves that they 
are very lazy and that they are just waiting for the phone to ring
to nail a couple a pirates. It's a sneaky campaing(remeber piracy 
is a theft and so is betraying fellow Atarifreaks in my opinion).
Let's go on with something else, I have seen that a lot of (in)famous
people are reading this magazine.
So I think that it is the best opportunity to greet some people,

The extra plasma greetings goes too:The Lost Boys(naturally)
                                    Incoders(Hi Nighthawk)
                                    Sewer Software(Possum)
                                    and all the other groups.

SupermegagigaplasmaslimingDBA FUCKINGS TO:C.S.L.(The guys who want to
                                                 destroy us(?))

I am running out of things to tell you. Time for some heavy 
craptalk !! WARNING do not read this text if you are under 
18 years old. Let me tell you a little story.

Once upon a time(wow what a beginning)there was a whale and a 
goldfish. The whale was very lonely and he was searching for
a partner. So after a view years of searching for a partner, he
falls in love with a goldfish.

Nothing strange so far do you think !!?

But there was a "small" problem for the goldfish and a "BIG" 
problem for the whale(or the otherway around). Now lets quit here,
maybe I tell you the ending of this story in a second article(but 
only if the readers want to). Lets wrap, see ya' next time(if there
is one).

            BIG greetings from Slimer and the rest of the D.B.A..


It's time for some heavy sliming(greetings). There are many ST
Freaks reading this maggie, so it is a nice opportunity to greet
some folks. Ectoplasmaelectronicpowersliminggreetings go to,
The Lost Boys(bbwweeuuurrgg)very bad magazine(the baddest) 
Incoders(a happy hi' to nighthawk) Middeltown Traders. All our
contacts in the Netherlands(Astra,TBW ect.) Superfuckin'electric
chair greeting to C.S.L.(Contemptible ST Lamers).

Sammy Joe asked me to write long articles(well you asked for it).
Oef' saved(I found a disk that was not damaged). Now I can go on 
with this boring article. I'am currently very angry(when not?).
Why ?? you probably think, well I getting sick and tired from the
fact that packages I send to other country's are always opend when 
I get them. Some packages that I have send never arrived on there 
destination. They probably think(?) that there is drugs in them
(only some crack cocaine) If they really think so, why don't they 
let a dog sniff on the packages instead of X-raying, opening the
packages or even destroy the disks !! How in gods name can 
packages get lost ?? You pay the fucking lamers huge amounts of
money for sending disks and what do they do....they rape the 
package so bad that the disks screw up ! I can understand if the 
package is big, that there can be something in it that isn't 
allowed. But if they really going further with this crap, I'll 
get really pissed off. If you ask by the post-office they will 
tell you that, they never open packages with that green piece of 
paper on them(They write on that paper what is in the package 
and it has something to do with taxes(bwuerg). But the open the 
package anyway too look in them(sneaky little lamers). I lost 2 
big packages with disks(maybe more) and I don't know where the
hell they are.

Well, maybe we are lucky(because in China they do 14 days about 
delivering the post).
So now you know why I'm pissed off(I think that most people will 
agree with me). Well time to stop because I must go to the post-
office to send this article to the Lost Boys.
Maybe you read this article if the disk ain't X-rayd or stolen !!
I hope too see ya' next time in this maggie or in one of our demo's.
Got to go now, I got to hit the post-office.
