     This "picture" was made with the TEXT GRAPHIST v1.0  by DAD
       





     I had written this text because I'm fed up with disks which are 
organized like "a souk" "un bordel" or "a brothel" !. I will use a 
word which is not in my Harrap's French/English dictionnary : 
OPTIMIZE, for the novices I'll not give a definition, and I say us: 
READ ALL THIS TEXT !.

     Let's go, now ! :
     Optimize is very important, because when you distribute your 
demo, it will be used and watched by a lot of people, if your demo 
loads slowly it will do waste time to a lot of st guys, and, it's so 
boring to wait when your computer is loading !...
     My first advice is: put this little word: LOADING, somewhere on 
the screen, when the computer is ... . Admit it's very easy !.

     Format :
     The better format is 80 tracks, 10 sectors. Why not 82 tracks ? 
 because some drives ( I got one ) can't write or read these 2 last 
tracks !!!, then they can't watch programs which are here and they 
can't copy correctly your demo !. 11 sectors slow down speed 
loading, and it's less reliable.
I had some problems to format disks with fastcopy ( write error ) 
the disks was too cheap !, then I used "Format" option ( by clicking 
on "Fast format option" ).

     Get some bytes free :
     Never forget that AUTOMATION packer v2.31r packs fast with F5 
key ( and it's very sufficient ) and can depack ( Lost Boys for 
example should pack the files which are in the PROGRAMING folder ! 
).

     Files Allocation Table :
     How to get speed loading ( drive don't lost time to move ! ), 
and to permit easy repairing ( Disc doctor ). When you have finished 
your demo, format a 80t 10s disk then copy it the files which will 
been first loaded ( A:\AUTO\*.*, then DESKTOP.INF, the main menu, 
and the others ), then the files will been at the start of the disk, 
admit it's more clean. A good utilitie to observe fat is CLUSFAT ( 
in french language ) sold 95 Francs at "LA BOUTIQUE DE PRESSIMAGE" 
of ST-MAGAZINE ( the best french ST magazine ). This program draw 
the fat !, like LOCKSMITH 6.0 on my death APPLE 2c...
     ( About locksmith: it's a pity, I can't find a very good copy 
program like this one ( only "Better coppy" have a good displaying 
of the development of the copy. )
     When you copy a disk with fastcopy 3 with "get used sectors" 
option, if you see on the display window that some tracks are not 
read, this disk isn't optimized. A disk where your develop programs 
never can be optimzed because you are alrealdy writing or erasing 
files.

     Here's the end :
     If you have a main menu ( in a utilities compilation for 
example ), copy it in a HELP.BAK folder, it's the prg the most 
important, and if there is some error in it, and the disk is 
unusable generally. 
     Don't forget to protect your boot sector against viruses. I 
call you back that "Dr Satan" anti virus don't work on STE ( it 
always find a virus ! ). I think the best boot secteur is the Virus 
Killer Omikron v2.0. When you boot with this disk, it search in 
memory if a virus is present. If there is one ( Ghost virus is 
detected ) it asks to you: Clear the ram ? ( and if you type Yes, it 
BLAST this fucking ghost virus ). Flexdisc the resident ramdisk is 
always detected ( no it's not a virus ! ), of course you should not 
clear the ram when you have installed this wonderfull utility. 
Omikron killer always exist in .prg form, it takes about 500 bytes 
and it is very usefull ( hard disk owner for examples, or in the 
auto folder of Flexdisc ).
 
     Now some advertissing : do you have got the "MAIS VOUS ETES FOU 
!" demo ?. Sampled muzex for 1040 st, and 2 dancers that you can 
control ( numpad keys ), the disk also contains the lyrics. For the 
french : pour l'obtenir, prends ton minitel, 3614 RTEL2, ecris … 
BENNY lis son repondeur, et fais ce qui y est indique.
     Have you ever used "IMPACT UTILITIES" ?, there is the best 
utility  program I know, the version 2.7 is actually the last. 
     Do you know "TEXT GRAPHIST" ?, it's a new soft to make text 
logos, or text graphisms ( more difficult ), whithout an more easyly 
than a text editor. v1.0 is freeware.
     Have you got "SASHO" v1.2 ?, it allows you to hear fastly your 
samples ( .SPL ). v1.2 is freeware.

friends, you'll contribute to the improvement of the ST software.
