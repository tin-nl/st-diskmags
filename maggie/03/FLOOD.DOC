FLOOD
-----
You can read it in every magazine all over the world, this game 
is really superb. Just for those who don't know whal I'm talking 
about: It's a four-way-scrolling platform game, with lots of 
weapons (with beautiful digi-sounds), lots of enemies and, well, 
everything else such a game needs. There are two specialities in 
the concept: your character (called Quiffy) can walk up the walls 
and over the ceiling (most of them, anyway), and there's a water-
level constantly rising (with the water floating quite 
realistic), which is sometimes the main threat, as Quiffy can't 
hold his breath for very long time. Think a bit about the concept 
and then think about a game with this concept and everything else 
simply perfect: graphics, sound, controls, well just about 
everything. Sprites are big and really, really cute; explosions 
and detonations are great to listen to and so on. It would really 
be a pity if this one wouldn't top the charts, as it's by far the 
best of its kind I've ever played.

Some Ratings:

The CONCEPT is great, and it's really original, even though there 
are lots of platformers arond.
89%

GRAPHICS are, as I said, great. Cute, well animated and relly 
well defined.
99%

SOUND is a lot of digi-detonations, Oops! and Oi!-sounds etc.
95%

PLAYABILITY is very important in such games, and this one plays 
perfect after a short time of getting used to. There are also 
some passwords to make it easier to play through all fouty-one 
levels.
98%

Ahem,,,  you have all probably got this one by now,  by one method 
or another (Naughty children!!) but here it is anyway...

You  are  Quiffy,  small,  bloblike (a distant cousin of the  late 
Elvis  Presley??)  and  close to  extinct...  Your  prospects  for 
continued  survival look even dimmer when the oddly-named Taps  of 
Wrath  start  to  flow  and fill up  the  system  of  caverns  you 
inhabit...
 
You have no recourse except to make like the wind (PHHRRRTTTT!!!!) 
and  leave to avoid drowning whilst picking up all empty  cans  on 
the way out (which means Quiffy is small,  bloblike and incredibly 
stupid...) As no platform game is any fun without them, on the way 
you  have to deal with various enemies which infest  the  caverns, 
such  as psycho-teddies,  bulbous-headed vongs,  and Bruno Brooks, 
the Radio 1 DJ. (Hang on, I think the last one is wrong!! - ED)

The  game was put together by Bullfrog,  of POPULOUS fame,  so the 
end  result  is naturally very good with loads of  little  touches 
which mark it out from the crowd.  The quality of in-game graphics 
is  very good,  with some amusingly-animated enemies,  some lovely 
weapons to pick up to do them in,  and also some excellent in-game 
sampled sounds,  such as explosions, splashing and gurgling water, 
as  it  rises and you have to swim for it....  The game design  is 
very  strong,  a  mediocre platform game would make do  with  just 
going through the caverns, the rising flood adds a certain amouint 
of  pressure/addiction  factor?  to get a move on...  You can also 
climb up the walls and ceilings, sometimes this is very necessary, 
and  to cap it all,  you have the ghost of your dead aunt  chasing 
after  you,  which  is  also  a major  incentive  to  keep  things 
moving...

Difficulty  Level  - this seems to be just right,  once  you  have 
mastered  the art of doing things quickly,  and sticking to walls, 
and nailing the other little buggers on the level...

Percentage  ratings  - Sorry,  I don't do these,  but I would  say 
overall  8  out of 10..  ( NB.  there is no such thing as yet as a 
'10' game,  say Carrier Command,  at time of release,  was a nine-
and-a-half for reference purposes...)

Finally,  to sum up, it is a goody, but you may think it pricey at 
œ24.99  (The eternal complaint..) so I would suggest either  mail-
order or else try before you buy...
