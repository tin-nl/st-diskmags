
       Short DAMOCLES review by DONATELLO of TMNT.

I  know there was a review of this game last issue but it  didn't 
have any ratings and it didn't seem finished like that.
"A review without ratings is like a dog without a head." (A.Git.)
Any way, I think I'll tell you quickly what I thought of the game 
first.  When I first got DAMOCLES I thought it was very  good.  I 
think  it was the prospect of being able to visit loadsa  planets 
and  then travel any where I wanted.  Then I realised that  every 
time you went into space, the time you had left to save Eris from 
the  comet  (DAMOCLES)  went down so fast that  it  wasn't  worth 
continueing  with  the  game.   This  ment  that  after   finding 
everything  there  was to find on Eris,  the  game  became  quite 
boring.  Then  I  found a "time door".  A "time door"  is  (guess 
what?)  a  door that allows you to move from one  planet/moon  to 
another  without losing any time.  This means you can get to  all 
the places you need to without ever going into space!
Once you switch off your ST after playing a game of DAMOCLES, you 
don't  get a sudden urge of "must play DAMOCLES again because  it 
is so adictiveitas",  in fact while you are not playing the  game 
you  won't feel like going back to it much at all!  But  dare  to 
slip the disk in and switch on you computer for another game  and 
you  won't  be able to move for hours.  Once  you  start  playing 
DAMOCLES you become so absorbed in the game,  time will just  fly 
by,  which is bad news for Eris but good news for you on a  rainy 
day (rainy day? Jesus, its 34 degrees C. at the moment!).
Right now, time for the dogs head:

GRAFIXXXXXX:88% Not stunning but are good when you are travelling 
at 100,000 miles per second down the road.
SOUND:61% Ugh!  worst part of the game.  It doesn't really matter 
once you get into it though.
VALUE FOR MONEY:94% Nice manual and a big wall chart with all the 
planets of the Gamma solar system on
INSTANT APPEAL:89%
LONG TERM INTEREST:95%
GAMEPLAY:95.346527%
ABUILITY OF DISK TO WITHSTAND BEING STRAPPED TO THE FRONT OF  THE 
SPACE SHUTTLE AND TAKEN INTO SPACE:1%
OVERALL:94%

This is the sort of game you don't play for a week but then  have 
a three hour non stop playing session of. Very addictive once you 
start.
