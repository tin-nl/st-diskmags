
   The 10 ways to crash a Amiga(freak) by Prof.Slimer,

In this article I tell you the 10 ways to crash a amiga(freak).

1. Do nothing, the Amiga will crash without any help !!
2. Throw the Amiga from a sky scraper and the freak will jump
   after it.
3. Just show the freak the Mindbomb demo and he will throw his
   Amiga out of the window.
4. If these things don't work you can call the I.R.A. or contact 
   your local bomb specialist.
5. Hire a hitman and send the bill to the freak(he must sell his 
   Amiga to pay the bill).
6. Don't forget to tell the hitman to use Dum Dum(hollow point)
   bullets.
7. If this don't work use a L.A.W.(Anti Tank weapon) to "crash" 
   the Amiga.
8. Tell the freak that the ST is much better than his "Computer".
9. If this don't work prove it !
10.If all 10 point don't work you must get touch with me and we
   think about a new solution to your problem.

Now let me explain why a real Atari freak hate the Amiga freaks.
It's a long story and it start's with the Atari 600 and 800.
The Commodore users hate the Atari users because the 600/800 where
much better than the CBM 64 or Vic 20.(and that is a fact).
So the Commodore freaks got jealous(the bastards). Even the two 
compagnies where fighting one another.

Well Commodore thought that Atari was destroyed forever somewhere
around 1985 but Jack Tramiel got angry with Commodore(ofcourse)
and wanted revenge. So he bought Atari and there where even rumours
that Atari would sell Commodore out(It's a shame that this has 
never happend)but on the otherside this is the way to torture 
Commodore until it is destroyd. And I Prof.Slimer will help all
Atari freaks to destroy all the evil on this planet called 
Commodore !! Let's end the craptalk !!

By the way, the Amiga is not so bad(I say this to avoid comments on
this article). It's really a good machine(without counting the 
crashing and the workbench and the fact that the machine is ugly 
and the diskdrive is very slow). Well see ya' all next time with 
maybe another article by the Proffesor !
