There are some other things you can do at your office in the police station. It
won't give you extra points but it's fun to do.
- You can dial Sierra from you're phone in the police station. First you have to
look up their phonenumbers in your 'HOMICIDE OFFICER'S GUIDE', or you can dial
the operator "0" and when she ask's city just type "COARSEGOLD", name "SIERRA".
Write down the numbers the operator give's and dial them later. - You could try
getting some other phone numbers for instance the one for Larry Laffer in LA,
but the operator will send you to another phonenumber service. Try dial them.
(555-0001)
- It's also possible to try to get your commanding officer on the phone. Ask the
operator the phone number for the police in Lytton, and dial that number. (555-
5432).
- Try to hack the office computer. I haven't succeeded but try anyway. Walk to
the table with the computer on it. "LOOK COMPUTER", "TURN POWER ON", "DIR",
"CD", "SIERRA". Here you can get abstracts from the different games from SIERRA.
Read them.

                  THE END.
