                              by Michael Schuessler

This  part  of the magazine will deal with a  certain  amount  of 
politics. I have introduced this section in order to give a wider 
perspective  to our readers.  Although this article  has  nothing 
much  to  do  with  computing  I hope  that  you  will  enjoy  it 
nevertheless. 

                    THE  PDS (follow-up party to the SED  in  Ex-
                              East Germany)

     Hello and welcome to a new series of articles in this lovely 
magazine.  As  Germany is on the agenda,  or at least used to  be 
before  the golf crises arised I have decided to take this as  my 
first subject.  For some background information on why I am going 
to  talk  about this so unknown party I have to tell you  that  I 
have  been  on an excursion to Germany on which  we  had  various 
lectures on the east German politics.  One of the  lecturers,  Dr 
Monika Nakath, came from the PDS to tell us about their new party 
lines:

     She  started  off by giving a brief summary of her  life  to 
make ity easier for us  to understand what she was going to  say. 
She  then  began to tell us about  her  family  background,  that 
neither  of her parents were particularly clever and that she  is 
now married and has two childen.

     She  then continued to talk about her political  life  which 
started  when she was 14 years old.  At that age she  joined  the 
FDJ (a political organisation for teenagers to become involved in 
political  activities).   In 1970 she joined the SED  (which  was 
founded in 1946 by joining the SPD and the KPD in order to  built 
up  a  social  order)  and later in 1989  the  PDS.  The  PDS  is 
sometimes called the follow-up party to the SED which is wrong  & 
right  to  a certain extend.  First of all it is right  when  one 
looks at it from the members' point of view!  The PDS was founded 
in  order to make it possible for the party to inherit the  large 
finances which still existed from the SED.  If the PDS had wanted 
to  have no connections with the SED they would have been in  far 
more  troubles  than they are now (Money can become  quite  handy 
from time to time). The party's problems are also that a majority 
of  the people think that the party is following the  same  party 
lines as it did before,  but simply with a different  name.  This 
now brings me to the point mentioned above where I said that  the 
PDS is/is not a follow-up party. The political lines have changed 
drastically  and there are only some vast similarities  with  the 
old party lines.  

After  having  finished  her summary of the past  Mrs  Dr  Nakath 
offered  herself  to be questioned and promised  that  she  would 
answer the questions as good as possible.   A question that  came 
up  often during the question time was:  "What do you  understand 
under  Socialism  ?".  To  this question  she  replied  that  the 
majority  should  rule over the minority and  that  she  believes 
strongly in this.   Another question that she was asked was  what 
she thought of the wall.  She answered by saying that at the time 
the wall was put up she believed that the wall was very important 
in  order to protect the imperialism from the  capitalism  coming 
from the west.  At that time the west was portrayed as the hungry 
wolf  who  was  trying to take  over  everywhere.  But  she  then 
continued  that  she  changed  her  mind  after  the  Perestroika 
movement  and  that she then thought that their should be  a  lot 
more  freedom for the people.  She still carried the belief  that 
the wall should stay up. 

This  is  the  end  of this  month's  Political  View  concerning 
Germany.  I do ask you to write to us if you have any comments or 
suggestions on political themes that you would want to know  more 
about.  I  will always try to deal as good as possible  with  the 
questions that come in.  The question's will be in front of  next 
month's article concerning (hopefully):  Politics in Russia  !  I 
hope that you enjoyed yourself and that you have not quite fallen 
asleep yet.
