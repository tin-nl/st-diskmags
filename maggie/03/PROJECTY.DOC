A three-player simultaneously sportsgame is at least original, 
that's for sure. Unfortunately, there are also some unavoidable 
drawbacks, because there's very soon a two-against-one or, not 
much better, a two-fight-third-wins situation. On the other side, 
the game looks great and the scrolling isn't too bad, and there 
even is a reasonable sound.

Now what's it all about? Well, there are five square playfields 
(about four screens big); one featuring as some kind of selector, 
the others with goals in them. Every team has got one field with 
its goal only, while in the remaining one there are three of 
them. In every field, there's one player (some sort of a disc) 
per team. You can move around with your (ahem) vehicle and let it 
rush in the direction of the ball by pressing fire. This results 
in an enjoyable bouncing around of everything, especially the 
ball. Your first target should be to push the ball into an enemy 
field (or down into the "frantic"-area), second is to score a 
goal (or getting it out of your own area if you didn't succeed in the 
first bit). 

Well, there isn't much more to say about this one, it's  just a 
well-executed sports game (sort of, at least), and as it's the 
case with most well-executed sports games, it's quite fun but 
there's always a better one around (except perhaps for Kick Off 
II, which seems to be that best one). Not bad at all though.

The Ratings:

The CONCEPT is fairly good, but there's quite a lot of sheer 
luck, while there aren't many tactical elements. Wait for the 
ball (let the other two fight, remember?) and shoot it, or shoot 
straightaway.
73%

The GRAPHICS are really good. The discs look as good as discs 
can, the floor also has his own structure, making the whole thing 
look great.
92%

SOUND is good too, and does even fit to the gameplay.
76%

PLAYABILITY is the one-and-everything in such a game, and this one has 
got marvellous controls and nice bump-around routines. Well worth 
a look.
