Time for general weirdness and things.............

A  quick  word for those of you who have been stuck  on  a  desert 
island for over twenty years,  got rescued in 1987,  then hit over 
the  head  by something incredibly heavy,  and have just  regained 
conciousness  in time to read this review...  Captain Blood is new 
to you, congratulations......

The rest of you can go on to the next review or sensible  article, 
such as 'Diary of a Baby part 2 - Guide to chainsaws in the  home' 
or even reformat this disk...

Anyway onwiththeshow,  I am re-reviewing CAPT BLOOD,  as it is now 
on  Infrogrammes  budget label,  at a little bit below a fiver  (œ 
sterling..)  and  due for re-appraisal.  Has it stood the test  of 
time ??? (Cue dramatic 'der der der' music...)

Firstly, the intro sequence is still one of the better ones around 
with a re-mix of part of Jean-Michel-Jarre's Zoolook album,  which 
comes  across  very  well,  this being the days  before  4-channel 
sound  tracks  appeared  on the ST...You then  go  into  the  main 
screen,  which has been drawn in the fashion of the bio-mechanical 
'Alien'  style  as  pioneered by H R Giger...  The  graphics  also 
utilise  fast wireframe fractals for the planet-landing  sequence, 
some  positively amazing hyperspace colour cycling,  and others  I 
will mention soon..

The  object of the game as the captain is to locate the last  five 
clones,  which you need to re-unite with to stay alive, you have a 
very large universe to search through,  but the best way to do it, 
is   to  go  between  inhabited  planets  to  get   the   required 
information...

Contacting a populated planet,  requires a trip down there to meet 
the  inhabitants in person,  flying through narrow winding fractal 
canyons, and dodging the defence-systems on the planet. Successful 
arrival  means  you get to talk to the alien beings  in  question, 
through  the  universal symbolic code thingy  on  your  dashboard, 
piecing together what are hopefully the correct things to say....

Each alien race has it's own characteristics, some more irritating 
than others,  on one planet you can find a race of rambo-types who 
want you to blow up their neighbours planet by way of a  "favour", 
being a French game, of course, some of the characters want to get 
naked with you (Diary of an Alien Baby??!!?...)

You  have  realised  by  now that Capt  Blood  is  essentially  an 
adventure game,  dressed-up in several arcade sequences,  the game 
progresses by interaction with the aliens, and there is nothing to 
shoot,  well  alright,  you can blow up planets with an incredibly 
convincing huge explosion routine..If Earth was to go,  that's the 
explosion to do it....

Most people probably already have this,  so it is pointless making 
any recommendations, but it is one of the better early games in my 
view...

Finally,  for  STE owners this game will not work...No way,  not a 
sausage...Sorry, but's that the way it is...
