
              Nicolai Ceaucescu - A Day in the Death of....
             -----------------------------------------------

OUIJA BOARDS are extremely peculiar things to have around...Firstly you 
have to consider their dangers and drawbacks..

DON'T MESS WITH THEM KIDS, they give out disturbing manifestations 
of a world beyond our understanding, a world beyond the living....

For   instance,   they   can   throw  out  the   most   disturbing 
messages,,YOU-WILL-HAVE-ALL-CLIFF-RICHARDS-IRRITATING-MANNERISMS-
BY-THE-TIME-YOU-ARE-THIRTY.~~~~~~~OH-AND-BY-THE-WAY-YOU-WILL-BE-
DEAD-AS-WELL....

There  are also immediate physical manifestations of evil  spirits 
as well, such as nasty smells (depends how many onion bhajees they 
have  consumed  beforehand...) and violent movement  of  furniture 
etc. (Depends  on how many LITRE-BOTTLES of  Glenmorangie  Sheeps-
Widdle Fine Auld Malt whisky have been sunk beforehand...)

Anyway,  I would reiterate the point, DON'T MESS... It could screw 
you  up worse than a prize trip to Beirut.  (If you do MESS,  you 
have to clean it up, change trousers, get a new identity, or a new 
cat...)  At the same time,  I got this exclusive "live"  interview 
with the deposed and deceased former dictator of Romania,  A "Good 
Mate" Nicolai Ceacescu..

This  being the first interview since his timely-sorry,  untimely 
demise,  he was anxious to find out what was going down in the big 
wide (live!!) world,  and also very effusive about his post-demise 
activities..

He  firstly,  kicked  off  with his account of life  as  a  secret 
computer-buff...
" Well at the time of my arrest and execution,  I was awaiting the 
conversion  of  the Megamighty Union Demo to  the  Romanian  State 
Central Intelligence and decision-making database going under  the 
western title of CBM VIC 20. I had the countries best programmers, 
mathematicians,  and  people-with-ten-fingers-still-left-to-count-
with  working night and day on pain of death.  Many people came to 
me  with  the  phrase "This is impossible  and  ludicrous!"  which 
sounded just fine echoing off the wall the Securitate firing-squad 
favoured..It  is  my  personal belief they were on  the  verge  of 
getting  a  result when all the miserable bastards with  holes  in 
their shoes and clothes burst in to my luxury 5599 room  townhouse 
and I found myself needing a helicopter rather quickly.."

I delicately broached the subject of how he got caught....

"That one is easy, Mike 'Smitty' Smith was piloting, but he forgot 
to  miss  the  ground again" (NB.This  joke  intended  for  British 
readers only! sorry international readers,less obscure service now 
resumed...) In case you are the tiniest bit curious 'Smitty' is  a 
Grade-A Dickhead/Lamer who often appeared with Noel "I thought that 
hairstyle went out in the Seventies" Edmonds.

As  expected,  after  his execution,  Ceaucescu went to the  place 
where  all  the  bad guys go,  and was shown a range  of  fiendish 
tortures in vast boiling lakes of sulphur with thousands of  naked 
sinners having little toasting forks gently pricking their bottoms 
and other unmentionables. (Available now at Thomas Cooks -Tours of 
Hell- Only œ399 for two weeks full board..)

What happened next, I asked..
"Well  the Chief Demon turned and said to me,  I couldnt do any of 
that stuff as it was for 'senior members' of Hell only, and that I 
looked  as though I would enjoy certain aspects too much,  such as 
the  strategic  placing  of the toasting  forks  where  you  would 
normally expect to dangle limply in your Y-fronts, and use to poke 
the  wife and various mistresses etc..  These guys in Hell are  no 
fun..."

He then told me about the job he now had in Hell...
"Its  a  great  little  number,  stirring Beelzebubs  big  cup  of 
brimstone,  not  with  a spoon,  but with the bit of my body  that 
sticks  out  the  most,  they showed me a PLAYBOY  centrefold,  so 
unfortunately my nose lost that particular competition..Oh, by the 
way, I get to do all the scripts for STYLE-TRIAL as well..."

I asked if he had any messages for the rest of the world.
"Yes,  you`re  all  a bunch of CUNTS,  especially the bastards who 
shot me!!"

Also any unresolved questions or frustrations...
"What  would  have happened to BROS if either one of  them  had  a 
brain-cell to spare between them??" 

I told Ceaucescu it was no good speculating on what was clearly  a 
major no-go area, thoughtwise...

He then told me of his hopes for the future..
"To  get a gentler,  more thoughtful application of the  toasting-
fork, and also to be allowed to go to the toilet the first time of 
asking,  there are a couple of the guys who are really unlucky who 
have  been  waiting  for seventeen thousand  years.."  (With  VERY 
tightly crossed legs no doubt.)

Before  going,  he  handed  me  a crumpled piece  of  paper,  this 
contained a games review of the first major game blockbuster  from 
the Romanian State Software co..

    #########PEASANT-STOMPER or THE VAMPIRE STRIKES BACK########

description:

DESCRIPTION  OF  GAME."  you basically fly around in  your  MK  4 
Peasant-stomper fighter dropping bombs on unarmed civilians as far 
as  your  unlimited  budget permits and you  dont  get  killed  or 
anything bad like that.."

GRAPHICS-Big  grey blob is the fighter,  little black blobs at bottom  of 
screen are hostile unarmed civilians, little dots are air to human 
missiles..  Background  is  bright  purple  for  black  and  white 
machines, sound is produced by scraping fingernails down something

persons fingernails FOR BEST RESULTS!!)

PLAYABILITY-.004%

LASTING INTEREST-Don't be silly!

OVERALL A real bummer,  dont buy unless they run out of turnips at 
the hyper-turnip mart and you need to desperately eat something..

Well  thank  you for that review Nicolai Ceaucescu,  a man who  is 
(was!!)  as  good  at torturing people as  the  Carebears  are  at 
coding demos for the ST............

Well that is that as they say, if you are very unlucky and if I 
can  be bothered in this heat there may be more 'interviews'  with 
famous  dead 'celebrities' THIS WEEK Vlad The Impaler???  (I  hope 
not somehow..)

(C) N.  Ceaucescu (deceased) 1990, this material transcripted by 
  C.I.Holland,  after  some disk-head cleaning fluid got  into  my 
  Bovril or something....

   Written  c.  17/07/90  It is extremely hot for the  UK  at  the 
    minute,  even for summer so doing this is very hard going  and 
   not much fun...(THERE HE GOES AGAIN ALWAYS MOANING ABOUT THE  
   WEATHER....)
