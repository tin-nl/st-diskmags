

Hello   and   welcome  to  (splurge)  MUTANT   MONTHLY   PART   2 
(wibble).Just a few things I would like to say before I start:
    
        1.He Hem.....
        2.Wibble...
        3.My old man's a mushroom.....
        4.I rule the World!......
        5.I'm not really DONATELLO, I'm MAD MAD McMAD from MADTON 
KEYNES AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH      
AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH.............................


I've just come in from school to see a man, foaming at the mouth, 
being lead away from our house in a straight jacket singing  "I'm 
MAD MAD McMAD the MAD MAD MAN and I like fish and chips"(no, it's 
not  my  Dad).I can see he has been tampering  with  my  computer 
(that's  definitely not my Dad) but I think I will leave what  he 
has written to remind my ST to never compute for a  stranger.Well 
that's enough of that, behold the title.......

Cowabunga  comrads!(that  means hello) and welcome to part  2  of 
MUTANT MONTHLY.Holy gwakamoly (that means oh shit) have I got  an 
article  for  you!Well,   I  haven't  yet  but  I've  only   just 
started.What shall I do first?I know, a letters page!

                     DEAR DONATELLO........

QUESTIONS 
Mr.D.H.Lawrence  wrote in to us with some questions and  we  were 
more than happy to answer them.Here they are:
      
          1.Yes.
          2.You must be joking!
          3.Only on Thursdays.
          4.Have you seen Arsenal play football?
          5.That would be MICHAELANGELO your talking about.
          6.Hanging upside down in a warm vat of marmalade  while 
            having my goolys chopped of with a blunt instrument.

Well   I  hope  I've  answered  your   questions   satisfactorily 
Mr.Lawrence and if I haven't then you can just bugger off!

Oh God, I've just got really annoyed about something so I'm going 
to change the subject.


                       REALLY ANNOYING PART.

Yes  this  is the really annoying part and I'm  really  annoyed.I 
have had the continuous spell checker on First Word Plus and  I'm 
really  pissed of!What sort of dictionary doesn't have that  word 
"shit"  in  it?And it's not just that either.It's the  way  every 
time  you  supposedly  make a mistake the computer  makes a  very 
pathetic  an  annoying BEEP.It hasn't even got the  fucking  word 
beep in it!I think I am going to have to test it:

                 Cowabunga (beep)
                 Shit (beep)
                 Fuck (beep)
                 Bugger (beep) 
                 Bastard (I don't believe it, it didn't beep!)

It's not just words like that either.Check this out:
    
                 Didn't (beep)
                 Haven't (no beep)
                 Couldn't (beep)
                 Shouldn't (beep)
                 Wouldn't (beep)

Weird.Why  does  "Haven't"  not get a beep  while  all  the  rest 
do?These  mysteries will never sease (beep).I think from  now  on 
when  ever I get a beep I will say so.One last thing:If you  want 
to write to me about anything really annoying then write to me at 
the address given at the end (put REALLY ANNOYING PART before the 
address).

                  
                          FUNNY PART

I  just thought that I would write this part so I could tell  you 
about something that I thought was really funny.The only thing  I 
would like to say before I start is that all the things mentioned 
in this section are TRUE.

The people in this true story are:
                                  DONATELLO (That's me)
                                  Daniel (beep)
                                  Rikolv (beep) 

I you sitting comfortably?Good then I'll (beep) begin.We were all 
sitting  in a German (beep) lesson and Rikolv (beep)(he's a  very 
deprived child by the way) was telling us about a film which  was 
supposed  to have a really sexy (beep) girl in.(I would  like  to 
point out that in fact this film was about as sexy (beep) as  Sir 
Robin Day).Daniel (beep) and I were interested and Daniel  (beep) 
asked "how big are they?" I was quite interested about this so  I 
listened for an answer.Rikolv looked puzzled,"What," he said "her 
cousins?" For the next 15 minutes Daniel and I were rolling about 
on  the  floor laughing.It was not until about 30  minutes  later 
that  Rikolv  (I told he was a deprived child) realised  what  we 
were talking about!

By the way,  I have got pissed of with writing beep all the  time 
so I have stopped.

Now for (another) brand new part to MUTANT MONTHLY.......

                  A TURTLES GUIDE TO..........
                       SOAP OPERAS.

Well,  there were so many turtles writing in asking for something 
like this in M.M.  that I had to write this article!I thought  to 
open A TURTLES GUIDE I should write about something that was very 
important to some people:  The Soap Opera.Why do people like soap 
operas  so much?Something this adictive can't be good  for  you.I 
decided  to  review  some soap operas so  that  you,  the  common 
turtle,  can  easily  choose what you want to watch.But  first  I 
would  like to show you why there are so many  soap  operas:  its 
because  (quite obviously) they are so easy to make.I  will  even 
prove this by making my own soap opera.And here it is:

                      DICK HEADS

Joelene  :Hi Marlene I just heard from Bruce that you  cracked  a 
finger nail.Are you okay?
Marlene   :I'm  fine.It's only a little crack.Darlene  must  have 
told Bruce about it.She's always exaggerates things.Have you seen 
Noelene any where?
Joelene  : No.Listen Marlene, I've got to tell you something.
Marlene  :What?
Joelene  :Well you know Fred, your pot plant?
Marlene  :Yes.
Joelene  :Well,  the people who sold it to you were  robbers.They 
stole it!

Will  Marlene  turn  Fred  into  the  police?Will  Marlene   find 
Noelene?Will  Marlenes  finger  get better?Find  out  in  another 
exciting episode of DICK HEADS.

Okey  doke (I've got my spell checker off now),  I think I'll  do 
the reviews now.

                     NEIGHBOURS 

Well what can I say? This is probably the crapest soap opera ever 
made yet every one seems to like it.The only reason I managed  to 
bring  myself to watch it was because I was waiting for  the  day 
when  someone  closed the door and the set  fell  down!  This  is 
generally a piece of shit but some how,  when all the ingredients 
are  put together,  it comes out as being the most  popular  soap 
ever.

               SETS:42%
               ACTING:64%
               STORYLINES:55%
               ADICTABILITY:84%
               OVERALL:63%
                     
Comment:  Not very impressive. It is a disgrace to Mankind (okay, 
humankind) that People such as my Mum get so worked up when  they 
miss an episode.


                    HOME AND AWAY

Hmmmmmmmmmmm.Not bad at all really.  In fact I have to admit that 
this was the last soap I stopped watching,  When I used to  watch 
soaps (that's only about 2 months ago you know).

               SETS:81%
               ACTING:79%
               STORYLINES:68%
               ADICTABILITY:86%
               OVERALL:80%

Comment:This   has  to  be  the  best  soap  about  (that's   not 
necessarily  a good comment though).If not,  it's definately  the 
best Australian soap and that means much the same thing.

              
                BIG TITS!!!!!!!!
Well  I hope that has woken up any of you who were dropping  off. 
Now  I  can carry on with what I was doing.  I think  perhaps  my 
reviews  are  getting a little bit boring so I will try  to  keep 
them as short as possible:


                 EASTENDERS 

Pretty good. It used to get a bit boring but now they have livend 
it up a bit.

                SETS:87%
                ACTING:75%
                STORYLINES:72%
                ADICTABLITY:54%
                OVERALL:74%

Comment:Not very adictable.

Well  I  was going to review CORRINATION STREET but  even  I  was 
getting bored so I decided to stop.
In  next months A TURTLES GUIDE I will be revealing  the  ancient 
art  of NOT DOING HOMEWORK JITSU (minus the jitsu part) where you 
will  be  taken from basics and taught until you become  a  grand 
master in NOT DOING HOMEWORK.


Now what shall I do?I know,  I'll save this file.I've just  done 
about 2 A4 pages of work and I don't want it wiped!  see you in a 
mo..........Good, now I've got this file saved on 2 disks!

At the moment my Mum thinks I'm doing my Economics courework  but 
I being very naughty and writing this article instead (ooh,  what 
a rebel). Now I think it's time to have some lyrics from the best 
tape ever made: TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.

                  SHREDDER'S SUITE





Oh yeh, I've just realised that SHREDDER'S SUITE doesn't have any 
lyrics.I  think  I'd better do something  else.I  know,  I'll  do 
SPLINTER'S TALES coz they are done like a story:
 
                 SPLINTER'S TALE I

I too once had a family,  Danny. Many years ago I lived in Japan, 
a pet of my master Yoshi(t). Mimicking his movements from my cage 
and learning the mysterious art of Ninjitsu. For Yoshi was one of 
Japan's  finest shadow warriors.  His only rival was a man  named 
Oroku  Saki,  and  they competed in all  things.  But  none  more 
fiercely than for the love of a woman,  Thang Shin.  Shin's  love 
was  only for my master,  and rather than see him fight Saki  for 
her  hand,  she persuaded Yoshi to flee with me to  America.  But 
Saki vowed vengeance.  I remember it well.  As my master returned 
home to find his beloved Shin,  lying on the floor,  and then  he 
saw her killer.  Saki wasted no words, and during the struggle my 
cage was broken.  I leapt to Saki's face biting and clawing,  but 
he  threw me to the floor,  and took one swipe with  his  katana, 
slicing my ear. Then he was gone, and I was alone.

And what comes after SPLINTER'S TALE I? You've guest it:
                 
                 SPLINTER'S TALE II

For fifteen years now,  we have lived here.  Before that time,  I 
was  a pet of my master Yoshi.  Mimicking his movements  from  my 
cage,  and learning the secret art of Ninja.  When we were forced 
to come to New York I found myself for the first time with out  a 
home,  wandering the sewers, and scavenging for what ever I could 
I could find,  and then,  one day,  I came upon a shattered glass 
jar and four baby turtles.  The little ones were crawling into  a 
strange  glowing ooze from a broken canister nearby.  I  gathered 
them up in an old coffee can,  and when I awoke the next morning, 
I received a shock,  for they had doubled in size.  I,  too,  was 
growing,  particularly  in  intellect,  and I was amazed  at  how 
intelligent they seemed,  but nothing could have prepared me  for 
what happened next.  One of them spoke. More word followed, and I 
began their training,  teaching them all what I had learned  from 
my master,  and I soon gave them names:  Leonardo, Michaelangelo, 
Donatello (yeh), and Raphael.

And now I think I'll go and have a bath. Bye for now!

Yeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.I'm  now 15 years old  and  MICHAELANGELO 
forgot  so  he  couldn't get every one to  beat  me  up.  For  my 
birthday  I got a TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLE hand held  game  and 
the TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE album and loadsa money.

Jeeeessssssuuuuuuuusssssss!!!!I've just looked at the stats.  for 
this  article  and it is already 12K long and into the  sixth  A4 
page!!!!  If  your wondering why it is so long then this  is  the 
reason:
I expected MAGGIE III to be out on 1st August and so was  writing 
it to be ready for then.  When I received MAGGIE II and saw  that 
it was not going to be out til September I swore very loudly  and 
banged my head against the wall a lot. This was because I thought 
my  article would be out of date.  Then I realised that  I  could 
Keep  up dating it,  making extra long and extra  boring  (that'd 
teach  those  damned L.B.'s to do MAGGIE every  month).  Any  way 
that's why it's getting so long.

Right then I think it is time for me to type my fav thing of this 
month (even though it's not a month):

               DON'S FAV GAMES

               1.KICK OFF 2 (totaly FAB)
               2.DAMOCLES
               3.MIDWINTER  (haven't really got into  this  game 
yet, but I still think it's good).

               DON'S FAV DEMO 
           
                1.erm......MINDBOMB + CUDDLY (I keep changing  my 
mind about which one is best so I put them both as no. 1.)
                3.SOWATT

               DON'S FAV GAME DEMOS

                1.NITRO  (utterly brill.  It's exactly  like  the 
complete game but there are only three levels.  Better then  most 
full games I'v got!!)
                 2.DAMOCLES  (not  a  playable  demo  but   still 
amazing!!)
                3.BATTLEMASTER

I  think  next  month (even though it's not a month)  I'll  do  a 
complete  run down of all the members of TTMNT but right now  I'm 
going  to  go  away  until I think of  something  else  to  write 
about.................

I've just had the worst bollocking ever form my D.C.  teacher coz 
I didn't hand my project in. He's say's he might not enter me for 
the exam but I know (hope!) he's only bluffing.  Still,  it's not 
the  nicest way to end the last lesson of the school  year.  Yes, 
that's right, it's (Monthy Python's Flying Circus) HOLIDAYS!!!!!! 
God I love being a turtle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And  Michaelangelo loves naked  men!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(private  joke, 
although you've probably got the jist of it).
I  don't think Michaelangelo is going to be very pleased when  he 
reads that.

After reading GIRL'S AND COMPUTERS in MAGGIE II (it was the first 
article  I  read,  can't  think  why)  I  have  just  thought  of 
something.  I have a sister and I am going to try to pursued  her 
to  write  something for this article.  From what she  writes  we 
should find out more about girls and computers. Wait a mo........ 
Oh  God she's picked up a pen and started writing down  ideas  of 
what  she's going to do.  I tried to tell her that you guys  will 
swallow any bull shit but she won't listen.  We are just going to 
have to wait..................
She is so lazy (my sister) that she has given me a piece of paper 
with what she has written down on it.  It's probably just as well 
she  didn't  come  in her coz then she would have  read  what  is 
above. Any, here's the message:

"Hope your lives are mellow and you are having plenty of acoustic 
experiences. Live in love and peace,
                Leaf the hippy."

Well,  what can I say?  Some people just can't be helped.  By the 
way, Sammy Joe, this is the one and, thank God, the only sister I 
was telling you about. Also her boyfriend wants to beat you up. I 
think  it was because I said (to my sister) that you were a  tall 
dark hansome blonde German (?) in front of him and he didn't like 
that very much. Just for the record he is a very tall strong body 
builder  who is at the moment being charged for murdering  a  guy 
who  tried to nick his girlfriend.  Now my sister is saying  that 
she  will  try  to  get her Boyfriend (known  to  his  friend  as 
Crusher)  to  type something in for this article but I'm  not too 
keen coz I don't want my keyboard broken.  Crusher is going  near 
Teddington next month and I think before he leaves I'll tell  him 
that you said you had gone to bed with my sister, just to get him 
in  the right mood for when he comes to kill hem,  I  mean  visit 
you. And now I think it's time to have a break.

I  have  just  read the ICC 1 thing be jigle and  it  looks  well 
naughty.  I wouldn't mind going along to one of those things  but 
I'd just play (ST) games all the time.  After reading it (it  was 
32 non A4 pages) I told myself that I would go to bed (who with?) 
but I decided to write a little bit about my day.  I had some one 
round  today  called Lea (that's pronounced Lee but I  think  his 
parents were drunk when they did the birth certifcate) who  might 
become  a  member  of TTMNT.  By the way at  the  moment  I  have 
SHREDDER'S  SUITE from the album TTMNT blarring in my ears  so  I 
can't  hear when 1st word plus beeps at me.  Any  way,  Lea  came 
round  and  we  had a game of KICK OFF 2 (wicked  game  which  we 
swapped with some one for BATMAN,  what a dick.  I think I  might 
buy  it  even  though it will be the first  footie  game  I  have 
bought).  We  had  a game of 20 mins.  each way.  the  game  went 
something like this:
Lea  gives  away a penalty which I miss coz I don't know  how  to 
take penaltys.
Lea gives away penalty which Hits the post!!!
Lea gives away a penalty which hits the cross bar!!!!!
Lea gives away a penalty which I score! GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!! 
Half time.  Lea is down to six players coz he keeps fouling me. I 
am down to Ten players coz the ref.  got it wrong and accidentily 
sent  my  player  off (come on ref.  I was going  for  the  ball, 
honest!).
Half way through the second half Lea scores!!!!!  Oh shit it's 1-
1. Time to start playing!!
About 1 min. after his goal I score!! GOOOOAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!
2-1.
OOooppss!  I've  given away a penalty but I've told himthe  wrong 
way to take a penalty so he misses by miles (HA HA HA).
OOooppss!  Given  away another pen.  and had another player  sent 
off. He know how to take pens. now but still misses by loads!!!!!
I've just remebered how Lea scored his first goal.  I took a shot 
at  my  own  goal coz I was bored and he knocked it  in  off  the 
rebound.
Any way I'm pissed bored again so on my throw in I pass it to one 
of Lea's players who manages to knock it in.2-2.  And now over to 
the commentater:
And  now  we are in the last 3 mins.  of the second half  and  it 
looks  like extra time is on the menu.  and DON'S goalie has  got 
the ball. He passes it out to the defender who runs a little way. 
And  he passes it down the line,  a long kick.  A  forward  comes 
across  and  is on the ball he gets  passed  one  defender,  two, 
three! He's in the area, he shoots, its there, in the top corner, 
GGGGGGGOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I  then give away two more pens.  (we wanted it to go into  Extra 
time) but Lea misses both so the final score is 3-2 to THE  GREEN 
MACHINE. We still wanted to have a pen. shoot out so this time we 
just did 3 mins. each way. After extra time the score is still 0-
0  so  the penaltys start.  The final score is 3-0 to  THE  GREEN 
MACHINE.  I  let Lea take KICK OFF 2 home so he could get  loadsa 
practise (and so I would get none) but I think I'll piss him  off 
by beating him again next week. 
I think I am now toned up for a game with MICHAELANGELO and  when 
I play him I may write what happened (depending on who wins). But 
that's enough from me and I'm now definately going to bed.

About 2 mins.  ago I had a bit of a nasty shock.  I looked at the 
stats. for this article and it said that there was only 4K of RAM 
left!  that ment that my article would have to be cut short  (why 
do I suddenly hear loads of people cheer for joy?  Are you trying 
to  tell me something?) Anyway,  I then realised that I  had  the 
dictionary on and with out it I actually had 90K of RAM left (now 
I  hear people stabbing and hanging  themselves.  Another  subtle 
message  perhaps?).  This means that my article,  when  finished, 
could  be 110K long (I now seem to be the only living  person  in 
the  South East)!!  I think in future (if I continue with  it)  I 
will do A TURTLES GUIDE as a seperate article and then you  won't 
have to read that part at all!

By the way, at the moment it is 26/7/90, 8 days after my birthday 
and I still have had no presents from any of you guys. I am heart 
broken (sob sob cry cry,  gimme loadsa presies!!!!).  However  if 
you  group  together and send enough money for me to  by  a  mega 
mansion,  a porshe,  a lambor...(I knew I shouldn't have tried to 
spell that!) and variuos other luxuarys then I might forgive you. 
As I have not been sent loads of demos by all you people,  I have 
nothing better to do than write more for this article.
 

                ST OWNERS ARE BEST AT FOOTBALL!

Okay,  I have a confession to make:  I was round an Ameega owners 
house the other day.
Before  you  all start to send me bombs in the post I  think  I'd 
better explain.  This guy (or should I say git?) had bought  KICK 
OFF  2 like me and he reckoned he could beat me at it  (you  know 
how  amiga owners think they are best at everything when in  fact 
they are really crap).  Well I knew that owning an ST would  make 
me  muchm  better than him so I decided to give him a bit  of  an 
advantage.  I  let  him  play on his Ameega which  was  quite  an 
advantige  because I wasn't used to such poor grafixxx and  sound 
quality.  I had never played KICK OFF 2 on the ameega before  and 
the only confort I had was that I could use my own joystick (yes, 
you can actually plug joysticks into those machines!).  The  game 
went  something like this (by the way this guys name  is  Anthony 
Lehmann.  You  can sort of guess he owns an Ameega  can't  you?). 
This  would be a battle that could change the course  of  history 
(what?!).  If  I  lost  I would be cast out from  the  ST  owners 
circles for losing to a git. I would never be spoken to again:
Oh hang on before I start I better write down the rules.  This is 
the standard game we usually play when having  a  game with  some 
one:
PITCH: Normal
DURATION:2 by 20mins.
WIND: None
EXTRA TIME: Yes
AFTER TOUCH: Yes
GAME SPEED: Normal

We have just got our selves a new member (see his ratings on  the 
KICK OFF 2 review) called Raphael (at the moment he is trying  to 
tell me how to spell his name coz it's so weird I keep getting it 
wrong).  Anyway,  I  thought I should let him write a comment  in 
this  article  so  you  can see what  he  is  like  (even  though 
Michaelangelo  has never been bothered to do fuck all  for  these 
articles) and here he is, Raphael:

Oh Donatello has asked me to write a piece of crap (like most  of 
this  artical,woooooops  sorry DON!).  PROBLEM,I don't  have  the 
faintest  idea  of  what i am going to write ,so  i  thought  i'd 
write lots of blahs.
        
      BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH

Well wasn't that exciting ..........NO..........
OH WELL THATS THE END OF MY LITTLE TALK OVEEEEEEER TO DONATELLO

Thank you very much Raphael. I think we all learnt alot from your 
words  of  wisdom (or should I say words of  complete  rubbish?). 
Raphael  is  about  to leave my house now (well  get  kicked  out 
anyway) so I'm going to save this article here.  Infact I think I 
might finish this article here completly (the crowd  cheers).  It 
is  still  quite  a time before MAGGIE III is realised  so  if  I 
decided to update this I will send a new copy to TLB.  If any  of 
you  have read all this article then you really deserve  a  medal 
for  endurance.  You  also must be complete losers  if  you  have 
nothing  better  to do than read this crap.  No,  no I  was  only 
joking! God you people have no sense of humour!
One more thing,  look out for an article by Raphael. I don't know 
what  is going to be called,  probably something like  "SOD  ALL" 
(god Don, how did you guess? Yes folks I'm still here!-Raph.).
Well I think that's definatly it!
GOODBYE...............until  next  time,  ha  ha  ha  ha  (that's 
supposed to sound like blood curdling laughter).
Oh shit I just remembered that I haven't put any use less info in 
yet so I'd better do it now:

                     Useless Infomation  

While doing this article I did too much stuff to mention!  It did 
take me about 1 month you know.

                Technical useless infomation

        A4 pages: 11
        Lines:577
        Words:4343 and increasing
        Bytes:26K (gulp!)

Right now I'm going to say good bye for the last time.  It's  the 
same as above.
GOODBYE............until next time ha ha etc.

P. The bit about the insulting messages was a joke. I don't think 
Michaelangelo would be very pleased to wake up and find 200 nasty 
letters waiting on the door mat.
P.S.  If anyone has played TV SPORTS FOOTBALL and has beaten  the 
score  107-0,  write in and tell me caz I want to know  how  good 
everyone else is at this game.  The score must have been attained 
while playing the computer and, of course, you must have won.
P.P.S.  If  anyone  has got any fab goals on KICK OFF  2  then  I 
woouldn't  mind seeing them either.  I would send your disk  back 
full of the best T.T.M.N.T. goals.
P.P.P.S. Goodbye. Finish date:14/8/90.



Ha,  bet you thought I'd finished! Fooled you!! You ain't got rid 
of me yet.  Now what was I going to do? Can't remember. Oh well I 
might as well give the results to some KICK OFF 2 games.
 
                DONATELLO vs. MICHAELANGELO

Before I start I'd just like to say that when we had this game we 
had  only just got it (you can tell I lost already  can't  you?). 
The KICK OFF 2 we had was the one we had borrowed off a friend. I 
had lent it to Mike so I had not played it for a week and when we 
played each other it was round his house.  The worst thing of all 
was  that I didn't have my own joystick.  Instead I had a  really 
crappy thing where you had to put you hand in an aukward place to 
reach the fire button.  It was also a non stanard game as we only 
played 5mis. each way. If we had played 20 mins. each way I think 
I  would hacve won easily.  Anyway I didn't have enough  time  to 
score  against him and he didn't even get a good shot in  so  the 
match went to penaltys.  The fire button on the "joystick" I  had 
been  given  was really crap and not at all like my  ZIPSTICK  so 
Mike had a big advantage. He was very lucky and scrapped through, 
winning 4-2. We still haven't had a proper match yet and we won't 
for  a long time coz he's sodded off to Franc for 3 weeks and  by 
the  time he gets back it will probably too late to  update  this 
article.

               DONATELLO vs. RAPHAEL

Easy peasy lemon squeezy!  Although Raphael has had this game the 
longest  out  of  us three he must be  the  worst.  In  a  proper 
standard  match  (see the setting in the other football  part  of 
this article) I beat him 6-2 and I wasn't even playing my best! I 
just thought that if Raphael reads this bit he might be a bit  up 
set. BUT I DON'T CARE, HA HA HA HA HA.

I've just had an idea for another great article! If you've played 
a  spectacular match with someone and want to really  cheese them 
off,  then  send  your results into me and I will  put  them  all 
together in an article. Also, you can choose the best goal of the 
match and send that in as well.  Tell us which goal in the  match 
it  was an if it's any good it'll be put on MAGGIE so  every  one 
(who's got KICK OFF 2) can see how good you are.  Infact I  think 
I'll enclose one of my goals against Raphael. If you want to send 
inyour  results  write to the address given above (the  one  with 
"all fan mail should be addressed to" above it).

I was just reading the FARTIE II article (I think it was that). I 
thought  give  a very fascinating fact  about  fish.  Fish  (like 
ammeeega  owners)  are very stupid and have very  short  memorys. 
This  means  that by the time the fish hsa swam round  it's  bowl 
once,  it's  thinking "Coorr this is new,  I wonder where I  am". 
Also,  I wouldn't mind being shut up in the smae room for all  of 
my life,  if it was a bedroom and had a nice girl in it  and,  of 
course if it had an ST. 

Well coz I ain't got nothing better to do, I think I'll send this 
off  to TLB.  When (and if) I decide to write any more I'll  just 
have to update it.
