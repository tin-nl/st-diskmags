Another  silvery  mirror platter thing with loads of data  up  for 
review..

Transmission is different from the other CD collections  available 
for the Atari,  in that it is Falcon specific.. It is another disk 
in the famous Whiteline series, and reflects its country of origin 
in  the  choice  of  much  of  what  is  available  (mucho  German 
software and documentation, in other words)..

This  is  no bad thing,  as it most famously includes  the  entire 
collections of material for the Fried Bits II and III events.. ALL 
the demos, including the smaller efforts, standalone graphics, and 
music  files,  which  tend not to circulate quite as well  as  the 
bigger demos,  are all found on here..  Most of these, I of course 
have,  but there are still one or two pleasant little surprises in 
there..  One  very  minor  point to note,  the version of the  EKO 
System demo on this disk is not the final version,  and is in fact 
the preview version, prone to be somewhat buggy and crashable..

It is also nice to try out some of the individual modfiles,  heard 
in many a demo,  including Lazers eight-channel works for the Lost 
Blubb Demo..

Other  demos  are catered for,  apart from the most  recent  demos 
(this disk was pressed in May '95?) And a very wide range of these 
are  available,  including  several very early Falcon demos  of  a 
single  effect  and  modfile  ilk which seem  to  have  eluded  me 
previously??  One  or  two ST or STE demos hacked to work  on  the 
Falcon  too,  the  strangest  entry being the  ancient  Lost  Boys 
'Definitive  Demo' which I am still not 100%  convinced will  work 
on the Falcon!?!

There is plenty of music, with a high concentration of modfiles of 
all denominations..  Several 'classic' Amiga tunes,  a folder full 
of  converted Adlib tracker Amiga chiptunes,  another folder  with 
some  Screamtracker  multichannel tunes,  several Digital  Tracker 
.DTM  modfiles in various places,  and even a player for Commodore 
64  style Future Sound modules,  with several stunning replica C64 
Sidtunes  included,  which  almost made the disk worth the  asking 
price  on  its  own!!  Also several players  for  these  different 
species of modfiles as well are included..

There  is  also a reasonably wide selection of  pictures,  with  a 
heavy  concentration  on  fantasy themes,  and Sword  and  Sorcery 
bookcover artwork..  Animations are patchy, with some good efforts 
in the .FLI folder,  but less convincing for MPEGs, and positively 
sad home movie type material for the .AVIs..  We are still limited 
to one not very good player for .AVI's at this time,  which hardly 
does the material justice in any case..

The  diskmags folder has a distinctly German flavour,  as  several 
editions of a couple of German language diskmags, which are Falcon 
specific, or multi-format are found here.. Bringing up the general 
interest  are  issues  10-12 of the DBA Mag,  issue  6  of  Falcon 
Update,  the  first  (and only?) issue of 'Eye on the Scene',  and 
issue 14 of good old Maggie!!  (Which is nice,  but issue sixteen, 
and probably seventeen were available at the time of pressing this 
disk??) 

The games folder is quite heavily populated, with several demos or 
nearly  complete  versions of most non or  semi  commercial  games 
attempted,  and  demos  of certain famous commercial  games  since 
released..  Most of these,  I had already got, but still, saves on 
that blank disk space.. There are some 'generic' GEM-type games in 
there,  mostly German authored, either written to work in ST-Mono, 
or  one  of  the  TT's  colour  graphics  modes,  which  are  less 
than interesting to non-German, non-GEM fanatics..

Utilities is a little less crowded, with several items of interest 
there.. Certainly not on the huge scale of some other collections, 
especially  the Mega Archive CD which seems to manage lots of  sub 
categories and scores of little interesting tweaks for ST's  built 
up  over  many years..  The Falcon still has a bit of a way to  go 
there,  although  it is strongly represented in the music  players 
category on the Transmission disk..

Two  full  versions of shareware programs are put on the  disk  as 
well,  the  choo  choo-em-up (sheesh!) game Golden Island,  and  a 
screen saver/machine speeder called Turbo Blanker.. Nice idea, but 
a bit heavy on the old Deusch again.. Golden Island seems to steal 
a  few  game design and layout ideas from the PC,  top heavy  with 
dozens  of  different files as it is,  one strictly for hard  disk 
only..

Ratings..

Content:-  88% - A goodly concentration of music and demo  stuff.. 
probably  the best modfile and demo collection of any CD  for  the 
Atari  Falcon  yet..  Useful  amounts of games,  a bit  weaker  on 
utilities..  Some  duplication of files,  as the compilers of this 
disk fell victim to the hoodoo of differently named files applying 
to the same program and not spotting it in time!!

Ease of Access:- 80% - Tightly grouped folders and subdirectories, 
logical  and easy to find programs and files..  Much documentation 
in German, so non-Germans are on their own with some programs that 
need more than a casual peek at the instructions to use properly..

Overall:-   87%  -  As  the  only  really   comprehensive   Falcon 
collection,  and the most up to date on CD-ROM at time of writing, 
definitely  an essential purchase if you have a Falcon and  CD-ROM 
drive..
