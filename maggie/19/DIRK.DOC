                       Fit the Umpteenth.. 


Hello once again,  ladies and gentlebugs!  Time for another 'Dirk' 
to  kick off with several pages worth of topical news  and  abuse, 
seeing you clear to the new year!!


              Psygnosis no more, no more, no more.. 

The  software  house,  formerly known as Psygnosis,  has the zappy 
new,  exciting title of,  erm,  Sony Interactive Europe..  This is 
probably   a  logical  step  on  from  Sony's  takeover   of   the 
aforementioned  Liverpudlian publishers,  and no doubt intended to 
clear the decks in time for the PlayStation launch due, any minute 
now (Sept..)

The  Psygnosis  name,  synonomous with so much,  from dodgy  Amiga 
games with umpteen layers of parallax scrolling, nice box artwork, 
and sod all gameplay to speak of,  poorly ported to the ST (Shadow 
of  the Beast),  to the odd real blockbuster,  which was handed to 
them   on  a  plate  by  more  talented  third  party   developers 
(Lemmings), will now be put into storage..

No  doubt,  anybody trying to use the name for their own purposes, 
will have the pants sued off them by a crack team of hit  laywers, 
kept fed on scraps of raw meat for just such an eventuality..
 
              
                  Top Three Sadness Charts!! 

Goody!  We've  not had any charts since before Delta Force started 
to  edit Maggie,  now as Next aren't on the job,  time for some of 
our own!!

I've not seen any trade press for a little while,  and it was very 
revealing  just to see where they think things are going over  the 
next few months.. It made very depressing reading..

So..

(Clapped  out music,  and clapped out old Disk Jockey,  can we get 
Alan  'Fluff'  Freeman for this?  starts reading out load  from  a 
piece of Paper..)

 - DER DER DER, da da da da, (You get the idea by now)

"Right boys and girls,  here are the top three items of sadness in 
the  CTW  (Computer Trade Weekly) Charts..  Straight in at  number 
three,  is  'Infotainment',  any  old rollocks on a CD-ROM with an 
'educational'  purpose  to get mum and dad's cash  in..  A  strong 
contender  for the number one slot at Christmas perhaps..  Holding 
steady  at  number two is PlayStation hype,  yes we can expect  to 
hear  much much more about this one for a very long time to  come! 
But  undoubtedly  straight  in at the top spot,  is  WINDOWS  95!! 
WINDOWS 95!!  The number one sad topic in the trade press!! That's 
all for now, goodnight!!"


                   Eerie Echoes of a past error.. 

You  may remember one of the 'hot' topics of the Maggie Party  was 
the  absence  of  James  Matthews  who  confused  a  place  called 
Northampton,  with  another  place called Taunton..  Well, they're 
only  175  miles (approx) apart,  easy mistake to make,  you might 
think? 

Well,  someone  who  won't remain nameless,  alright,  RiCH Davey, 
spoke on the phone the other day..

RiCH.  "You're  not going to believe this,  guess where I ended up 
the other day!!"

CiH. "Where was that RiCH?"

RiCH.  "Well, I was going down to Chelmsford on the train.. I fell 
asleep, missed my stop and woke up at!!!"

CiH. "Yes, where!?!"

RiCH.  "TAUNTON!!  It's a black hole,  a twilight zone for diskmag 
editors,  you'll be there next!  Just wait and see!!  I think I'll 
hold  a  conference  there,  it's the one place  in  Britain  that 
everybody can get to, whether they want to or not!!" 

CiH.  "Right RiCH, I promise not to tell anybody.. ..If you pay me 
a large sum of money!!"

Needless to say, he didn't, and here it is!!
 

                 Big Brother is still watching you! 

You might recall a piece in this column last time,  that MicroSoft 
were giving out free trials of their online service provider,  but 
using  this as another marketing ploy,  to find out what PC  users 
kept on their hard drive,  and mail those folk unelightened enough 
to  use  non-MucusSoft  wares  in  large  quantities..   This  was 
orginally  reported  in 'Private Eye' magazine  (cool  fortnightly 
satirical read, Kev (SH3) also gets it as well..)

MonolithSoft  subsequently denied the story,  but in such a way as 
to  confirm  the image of computer industry people  as  utter  and 
complete geeks with zero writing ability,  wit, or style.. However 
it  does  turn  out  that a part of this story  is  all  too  true 
though..

The  Windows  95  software  has  a  nasty  habit  of  giving  away 
information  about  itself when the MoronSoft  Online  Service  is 
being used,  for example,  anyone with an, ahem, "unregistered" or 
"Beta-Test" copy of Win95 had really better not think about trying 
the online service at all!!

But  I'm  sure  that  nobody  would be  so  silly  as  to  use  an 
unregistered copy of Windows 95 in the first place!!


                      Console to PC..

Both Sega and Atari are actively looking at extending the range of 
platforms  they  are developing software for..  They are  both  to 
launch versions of their more interesting games for the PC..

Sega intend to convert a number of Saturn titles,  but for Pentium 
only  PC's,  whilst  Atari will be looking to start with  'Tempest 
2000'  on most 486-upwards type PC's..  Atari,  when pressed about 
why,  advised  that  they  considered the present  console  market 
'unprofitable', with no dominant format emerging before 1997, in a 
marketplace  saturated  with 16-bit machines..  In other words,  a 
straightforward  revenue gathering exercise..  Both companies also 
consider  that the PC tends to be stronger in some  categories  of 
games,  (Flight  sims,  adventures etc) but with a gap in console-
type games which they consider to be in a good position to fill..

              
                       Slaphead Update.. 

Some  more  premature hair-loss related news..  And nothing to  do 
with Vic Lennard..

Having  caught sight of the new series of Gamesmaster (which  sort 
of  pretends  Dominic  Diamond is dead and the series  is  set  in 
Heaven,  well  we  can only hope..) I noticed copious  amounts  of 
premature hair-loss due to overactive follicle destroying hormones 
chasing around the bodies of two of the presenters..

Dominic  Diamond  himself  seems to be losing  it  'up  top'  with 
several  self-derogatory references to this condition  during  the 
course of the programme..  However,  the most delightful moment in 
this episode was the sight of Dave Perry without his bandanna..

His  stupid headgear is clearly camouflage for the very poor  crop 
of hair on the top of his head..  A few thinning blond strands are 
all  that  are left,  and we confidently predict that he  will  be 
combing  the few remaining strands across the top of his  gleaming 
bald dome in a 'Bobby Charlton' style in the nearish future!!  The 
burning  question is whether his stupid headgear stifled the  life 
out of his hair?? It is well known that if you cover up plants and 
other natural growth in complete darkness, it will kill them!

Patrick  Moore,  as the third slaphead member of the team at least 
has had a decent interval to grow old before losing his hair..


            Iranian Video game due shortly - World ends..

This item was blagged from Silicon Times,  but is such a priceless 
gem, it is well worth reproducing here..
 
                'Iran issues Islamic Video Game'

Iran has gone high-tech in its efforts to instill religion in  its 
people,  issuing what state-run Tehran television calls "The first 
computer game embracing Islamic moral values and beliefs is  being 
developed  at an Iranian research centre." Reporting from  Tehran, 
the Associated press says the head of the centre,  identified only 
as Mr Sho`ai,  as saying the games would be mass produced. But the 
report  gave  no  details  about  the  games  themselves.  "Iran's 
clerical  government has been trying to reconcile the  puritanical 
values  of  the 1979 Islamic revolution with  modern  technology," 
says  AP.  "Already,  the  Iranians  have  developed a  number  of 
computer  programs for the Koran,  Islam's holy book.  One program 
can  search  through  verses in the text  for  specific  words  of 
subjects

Ed-Comment..  We would like to know more about this!! What sort of 
platform these games are running on,  what sort of games they are, 
any  chance  of a licensing deal with a big software  house  'over 
here'??

On  a purely scatalogical note,  we have had a few ideas about the 
likely  titles  and  possible  content for  some  of  these  games 
ourselves!!

All  titles  due  for  Spring '96  release  by  HezbollaSoft,  RRP 
undecided, but double price for unbelievers!!

'Super Suicide Bomber Man' - Multiplayer martyrdom - ages 8  years 
upwards..

'Lockerbie Flight Sim' - One for older children with a rudimentary 
knowledge of explosives and high-altitude detonation triggers..

'Manic Mullah' - A uniquely Islamicised interpretation of that old 
ZX Spectrum platform favourite!

And of course, the sequel, 'Fatwa Willy'..
 
And I think that is more than enough for now!!


 Amiga/PlayStation Link revealed! - World ends twice as quickly!!

This in from one of our regular correspondents, Ed Cleveland..

"I've   finally   worked  out  the  horrible  truth   behind   the 
PlayStation..  Remember  how  I complained that the  joypads  were 
originally  too small?  Well after seeing the PlayStation adverts, 
it all fell into place.  What animal has small hands?  Why, a baby 
chimpanzee  of  course.  What  happens if you buy  a  Playstation? 
According  to the adverts,  you transform into a baby  chimpanzee, 
and so,  your hands are able to use the joypad comfortably. But it 
does  not end there!  Sony transforming the entire human race into 
baby chimpanzees to compensate for a design cock-up is not the end 
of  the  story!  Imagine if you were a baby chimp,  what  thoughts 
would go through your head? 'I want to eat a nice banana','I fancy 
a swing through the trees a bit later', and 'I'd quite like to buy 
an  Amiga  1200 for four hundred pounds a bit later  still'.  Yes, 
I've worked it out at last! The PlayStation us all a plot by Escom 
to sell mouldy old Amigas, Here is the proof!"

(Liverpool Echo - Friday late edition, sometime late October..)

OUT-PLAYED

The Amiga is back!

It  has  outsold the Playstation in the new  machine's  first  two 
weeks of sales at leading distributors.

Could  this  be the start of what is expected to  be  the  biggest 
Christmas bonaza ever for the computer and games market?

ED-(CiH) note, yes, thanks for that mate!!


                  Atari clear the house..

In  an  unprecedented move,  Atari have ruthlessly reviewed  their 
current portfolio of Jaguar developers and have sacked many of the 
non-productive  ones..  Put  simply,  'official'  status has  been 
withdrawn from those game developers who have not come up with the 
goods  as  yet..  This  means that they will have to  finance  any 
cartridge production from their own pockets, and this can cost big 
money..  No names as to who is affected yet,  but it is understood 
that the Virtuality VR helmet add-on has been discontinued.. A lot 
of  games  that  have  been 'announced'  on  day  one  have  never 
appeared, nor show signs of doing so, and it seems that Atari were 
caught  out  yet again by many developers who  were  just  holding 
their hands out for free kit,  then sitting back and doing nothing 
with  it..  (Even recognising that quality games do take more time 
then they first seem to need to develop..)

Hopefully,  the  logjam  of  pending,  but  never quite  seen  new 
releases  should start to ease..  I don't imagine Sony being  this 
indulgent with their developers..  I imagine, in fact, that anyone 
acting  in  a casual assholish fashion with them  would  be  eaten 
alive by some of the hit lawyers left over from defending Psygno--
sorry,  Sony Interactive Europe, that I mentioned earlier!!

(In  a totally unrelated move,  both the Maggie Editor and  Deputy 
Editor  have  added Jaguars to their  hardware  portfolio..  These 
purchases  being  made  at  the thrifty  end  of  the  scale,  ie. 
secondhand for not too much cash at all - nice!!)


               Well, well, well, well, well..

And  once more Bill Gates is back in Private Eye (see last  issue) 
concerning the 'extra-curricular' talents of the Microsoft Network 
program.. 

In Private Eye, issue 887..

"In  July this year Microsoft came under fire for hiding a  search 
facility  in its new MSN registration software,  which without the 
users knowledge scanned the users disk for rival programs."

"The  company  denied this was the case (actually  denied  in  the 
letters  pages of the 'Eye the issue after they ran the story,  in 
fact  -  Ed)  but  was forced  to  backtrack  after  the  American 
investigative journalist Andrew Shulman - who has previously  used 
his programming skills to uncover many of Microsofts dirty  tricks 
-  proved that the 'sniffer program' was sending details  of  more 
than  100 of the users programs back to Microsoft.." (Which  means 
that  the Microsoft representative who wrote to the letters  pages 
was lying - knowingly or unknowingly -Ed again??)

"The  company  also  denied  that it was  using  this  new  spying 
technology for junk mail purposes - but somebody is."

"When Eye reader Steve Jones bought a copy of Maxim magazine  last 
summer  with  a  'No  anorak required'  CD-ROM,  he  had  to  call 
Microsoft  from  his computer to receive some codes  which  unlock 
games on the CD.  Microsoft asked for Mr Jones's personal details. 
Wary  of  any 'registration wizard',  he passed on a  false  name, 
address, telephone and fax numbers: Mr R Head, 3 Railway Cuttings, 
Bollox,  Surrey.  (damn,  that's where I take my summer holidays - 
Ed) But lo and behold,  a couple of months later,  at 1am, his fax 
machine  received  an exciting letter from Eric Fuller  of  Dennis 
Publishing - Maxim's publisher."

"Dear  Mr Head",  it began,  "As a loyal reader of Maxim magazine. 
I'd like to tell you how to save œœœ's.."

"Yes  the software on the CD-ROM had managed to deduce Mr  Jones's 
correct   phone  number  by  interrogating  his  computer  -   the 
information then somehow finding its way to Dennis." (*)

"Mr  Jones compares the intrusion to a burglar breaking  into  his 
home to go through his address book and has complained to the data 
protection registrar."

(*)Just how was this done though??

So  it  seems that this story will run and  run..  The  inevitable 
moral being once more,  don't 'do' Microsoft, it will really screw 
you up!!


                Something old, Something Weird..

And  all  is not well in the land of Amigadom either  since  Escom 
took over the plot..

Escom  relaunched  the  Amiga A1200 this year..  On  the  surface, 
nothing had changed apart from the fact that it was œ100 more than 
when  Commodore  had  been selling  the  thing..  However,  recent 
reports  have  been reaching my ears that  certain,  compatibility 
related  problems  with software produced  for  earlier  Non-Escom 
Amigas have arisen..

Oh no, here we go again, we all cry!!

Unfortunately there is little concrete information in the  'what's 
wrong  department',  but we're sure we'll here more of this  quite 
soon..  (Some early rumours suggest that Escom cost-cutting may be 
the problem, they are notorious for their 'cheap' PC's and if they 
have  missed something off the basic design,  or it is working  at 
reduced tolerances, who can imagine what might happen??? 

More on this when we can!!

/////////////////////////
// Supplemental info! // 
///////////////////////

At  least two Amiga publications have reported on these  problems, 
one of which issued a statement given by Escom which was bland and 
uninformative to say the least, promising a cost-free hardware fix 
of an unspecified nature..

The  other  mag,  Amiga Format described the problem  as  relating 
specifically  to the floppy drive,  and how this is accessed at  a 
very low level by some software..  Changes to this mean that a lot 
of  disks  accessing the floppy in a certain way simply  will  not 
work  as  the computer won't 'talk' to them..  The only  solution, 
according  to  Format,  would be to remaster the disks  concerned, 
which  means  a whole lot of older software is going  to  be  left 
permanently out in the cold!!

So business as usual for the Amiga bods then..


       Traditional spot for worst computer related Telly ad..

A  crowded field as usual this year,  but with only two real stars 
of  naffness shining out..  We have to put both the Sony and  Sega 
efforts  to bed first..  These merely fail from over-use of  flash 
fast-forward style visuals, and tumbling head over heels in a mass 
of confused images.. They do not get you right down *there* in the 
pit of your stomach to irritate,  annoy, anger, and just wonder at 
the slug-trail mentalities who thought that one up..

The two candidates for the golden media turd award are..

Apple Mac advert, (pre-Xmas).. 
So you can turn a œ2000-odd computer into an elaborate multi-tedia 
alarm clock for a ten year old then? The Mac in question obviously 
has  a  video  digitiser or Genlock to grab those  images  of  mum 
yelling,  also  that lucky ten year old must have access to  dad's 
expensive  camcorder..  All  this to duplicate what a œ3.99  alarm 
clock  with  a  loud bell can do..  A case of  overkill  equal  to 
chartering a Boeing 747 to go to the shops!!

'Easy PC' magazine advert (post-Xmas)..
This sad piece of junk is aimed squarely at the 'Richard and Judy' 
generation  who  have  just purchased a PC  for  the  first  time, 
because they were told to or something..

This  publication  is one of those multi-part  things  which  over 
several  months and much cash builds up into a complete  guide  to 
your  PC..  The  agonising and poignant portrayal of the  'typical 
dumb  dad'  deserves  an  award  all on  its  own  for  the  actor 
concerned..  We  scream with laughter as he picks up and  discards 
the  mouse mat,  chortle as he tries to use the mouse as a  remote 
control,  and vomit loudly when we catch sight of his final cheesy 
grin  as he takes controls of a flight sim..  The sheer talent  of 
the  unknown individual playing 'dad' cannot be contained in  this 
paragraph..  Needless  to say,  the facial expressions were a dead 
ringer for the Jasper Carrott character,  'Wiggy', and I just hope 
that Jasper gave permission to use them!!

This advert wins outright,  as it confirms my suspicions about the 
mentality  of  a lot of people who have rushed into  getting  PC's 
because  of market hype and peer group pressure..  It serves as  a 
useful warning to us all..


                       The End is Here! 

Another  Dirk draws to a conclusion as another (overdue) issue  of 
Maggie finally makes an appearance..

Will we be back soon, sure we will!!

See you around, bye for now..

 (C) CiH - various in 1995 and 1996..
