                         SHEER AGONY PREVIEW

Sheer Agony is an adventure  game  from  France.  I'm not totally sure
about the plot, but an early version I have seen shows promise.

The intro sequence leave you rather  disturbed. It begins by colouring
in an Atari Falcon logo (in case  you had forgotten which computer you
were running the demo on) and then fades in some logos.

The main menu features perhaps the worst logo distorter I have had the
misfortune to see in my life.  In  defence of the programmers they are
using GFA basic, but even so  they  should be tried for crimes against
distorty demo effects.

The main menu allows you  to  toggle  the  internal speaker, mouse and
powerpad control and also set the  sound  volume. You can set the left
and right channel volumes individually!

Sheer Agony runs in true colour mode,  and all the locations have been
lavishly drawn (some look like  scans).  The  game itself looks like a
fairly straightforward point and  click  adventure.  Your character is
blessed with the following abilities:

GO     LOOK    DRILL READ
OPEN   SMELL   PRESS TURN
CLOSE  SWALLOW PUSH  RAISE
SEARCH TAKE    PUT

Some interesting options here - drill  being  one of the most obscure,
unless you are some kind of serial killer??!!!

The preview gives  you  the  chance  to  visit  a  handful  of outdoor
locations. You can't go into  the  manor  (where  I assume most of the
action happens) as this ends the  demonstration. This reminds me a bit
of Maniac Mansion, but lacks the cartoon style graphics and animation.

"SMELL" is quite an unusual  function,  but  it  can give you hours of
juvenile fun,  especially  as  the  computers  retorts  are  in broken
English: "You don't smell something weird"  it  tells you as you sniff
places at random. You can  also  get  the  equally baffling "It smells
nothing". Cheers.

If you attempt to press the bell  of  the house it informs you "Shush,
be discret" leaving you to  wonder  just  exactly what being "discret"
involves. If you  mess  around  too  much  you  are  rewarded with the
comment "You do a stupid stuff". Respect.

Look gives you a zoom window so  you  can examine the graphics in fine
detail, obviously an aid for the well hidden clues.

The movement from location to  location  is unnecessarily laborious. A
white dot appears on the map and  this  has  to move pixel by pixel to
the next location before the main  screen  is  updated. I hope this is
removed in the final game!

It is quite hard to judge the  game from the preview. The graphics are
excellent and there are  also  some  great  sound effects. There isn't
quite enough there to get your  teeth  into the gameplay. My real fear
is that in the full version there are only 25 locations, which isn't a
great deal for an adventure game.

There is quite a bit of potential in this release. If you are a fan of
graphical adventure games this really should  be one to watch. We just
hope that Sheer Agony will turn out to be a real pleasure.
