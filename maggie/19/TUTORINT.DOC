  I have  been contemplating writing an Assembler  Language  tutorial for  some
  time but  never  felt that I was the man for the job.  Well, as you can see I
  have  decided  to give it a go.  These  tutorials will start with VERY simple
  routines and necessary tweeks so you are able to  start  coding in 68000.  If
  I design these tutorials correctly, you should be able to write your own work
  by the end of this series.  Even if it is altering my codes and  implementing
  other codes, this also counts as a great leap forward in programming. Instead
  of just assembling pre-written codes, such as intro codes  where all you have
  to do is change  the  picture, music, font and  scroller , you  hav e created
  something new. This achievement most people will find to be very exciting but
  to many  people, they feel that  they have achieved one of the many thousands
  of simple, and complicated,  routines in  the complex 68000 language.  It all
  depends on you, obviously.  I hope I explained that so it was understood!!!!!
  

  These articles will be very easy  to  understand,  and there will be a lot of
  actual coding, and  explaining, and  much less of  un-necessary chat, as most
  people will look at tutorials and see all the text and  very little  code and
  think s*d this, and will not even bother to read it, let alone understand it!
  
  
  Please try and follow what I am trying to do in my tutorial, as  the ST scene
  does need much, much more amateur and expierienced  coders, may it  be 68000,
  GFA, STOS or C, it all helps towards the survival of the ST,and of course the
  Falcon, as most owners of ST's will, hopefully, buy Falcon's,true? Maybe not!
  
  
  As I said the tutorials will be extremely easy to understand, as I am only an
  amateur coder, but am able to code most things.  The main  thing you  have to
  remember, when coding on a 16 bit machine, is that most of what you code will
  orientate around the manipulation of bitmaps and graphics.   If you  go  onto
  writing in C on the PC, using X-Windows, then it becomes a hell of a lot more
  difficult, and you are no longer using graphics but  creating  and  using the
  created graphics in the execution of one program!!   For  example, creating a
  program with 4 windows.  The first window tells you what is going on and some
  options, while the other three windows  contain  the  following;  Window  one
  contains a polygon with three facets.  In  this  window  you  are able to add,
  remove facets, and alter the position of each facet.  The  other  two windows
  are copying what you are doing, one in even-odd algorithms and  the  other in
  a different algorithm.  You are also able to change the  way  the  polygon is
  displayed in the other two windows, for  example,  filled  (with  or without)
  tiles, points etcetera.  Everytime you alter the factes in the  second window
  the other  two  must  alter,  in realtime, obviously,  their  facets,  whilst
  compiling to the set algorithm.  You can then, save out the facet data as the
  vertices and x, y, z values, in  a  resource  data  file.  This  is  just  an
  example of a far most complex program that creates 2D polygons where you have
  to create the graphics instead of using pre-drawn graphics...well I  did  not
  really  need  to  go  into  so  much  detail but  hey, if you are going to do
  something then do it properly.

  
  Anyway, this is the introduction over.  Look out  for GFA and  STOS tutorials
  from other members of Effect, and even addition 68000 texts but  I doubt  the
  latter!!

  Enjoy..........and do not forget, coding is one of the BIGGEST nightmares you
                 can possibly tackle on the ST, especially on the STf!!!  It is
                 FAR easier to code on the STe but I will not go into this,just
                 yet!!         Do not quit!!!         Coding is like  sex,  the
                 first few times....no I will not continue.....................
