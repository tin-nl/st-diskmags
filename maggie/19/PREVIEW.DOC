Top  Byte  stuff - Stario's Xmas is now with us,  which is  Stario 
with snow, and Christmas and stuff.. To follow is Stario Space Ace 
at some point soon,  and also some other non-Stario releases..  Of 
these,  an overhead 'Cannon-Fodder like' role player 'Arnorath' is 
most keenly awaited..  Initial screenshots do look promising,  but 
it  is 1 meg and above,  which is most people on the ST now really 
though..

BIG  MERLIN ANNOUNCEMENT - Falcon Obsession is back on!!

Yes, the copyright to Obsession has been passed over to Merlin and 
the  Falcon  version  is  back on..  Two new versions  are  to  be 
released, the first being a simple reworking in 256 colours of the 
original  game,  the  second  being effectively a  new  game  with 
multiball  and multi flipper options,  new table designs as well.. 
This news was first announced at the Atari World show in London in 
early December..

New 'Doom' game for the Falcon?? 

A  Freeware or Shareware Doom game for the Falcon may  yet  become 
reality..  Under  the  provisional  title 'BAD MOOD',up  to  THREE 
different  teams are working on .WAD players for the  Falcon,  and 
actively looking to expand these into a full-blown 'Doom' game for 
the Falcon..  Doug Little is understood to be providing behind the 
scenes  help on this one for the DSP coding involved..  It is also 
understood that the players can load any scenario (.WAD file) from 
'Doom',  'Doom II',  and even 'Heretic'.. Certainly early versions 
of  the player were seen at the Atari World show..  These did  run 
recognisable  levels  from  'Doom',   although  this  version  was 
strictly  solid 3-D polygons with no texture mapping  (since  done 
with   a  decent  turn  of  speed)  or  any  beasties   as   yet.. 
Interestingly,  both DSP based versions for standard Falcons,  and 
an '040 powered version for the Afterburner accelerator board were 
there as well..

Hopefully,  a  more  detailed appraisal soon,  as I should have  a 
recent version of the player to hand shortly..

==New Reservoir Gods stuff here==

The Reservoir Gods are still as active and, hopefully, prolific as 
usual..

Coming  up soonish,  a new 'Columns' type game with loads of extra 
features  including  a multi-player (up to four!) option..  It  is 
understood  the  game code is largely done but it just  needs  the 
completed  graphics to finish off..  Also at their end,  the other 
two  ST-owning  members have managed to produce a  demo  of  their 
(very) long awaited 3-D racing game..

Other  things in the pipeline include the Falcon Owners Group  CD-
ROM  front end,  and also preliminary investigations into  texture 
mapping for a new 3-D game??

And  this  from  Rich  Davey  of  Falcon  Owners  Group  fame..

Some points I want to make about OUTRIDER :-

A Falcon version with True Colour gfx etc will be released in Jan 96
(the code is done but I need my PC to do the raytraced ships, etc).

I will release OUTRIDER under a new software label - VILLAGE SOFTWARE
- this label will be used for some educational PC releases, a couple 
of new ST games and future Falcon productions.  OUTRIDER FALCON will 
be released via Village Software and the Falcon Owners Group.  
The retail price for OUTRIDER is going to be œ12 with a proper glossy 
manual and boxed - available from the usual FOG address but please
make any cheques or PO's payable to "Village Software".  It will be 
available from November the 1st onwards.

Due out next year are 

WARCRY   
the sequel to Outrider with much improved AI and lots more worlds, 
unit types and easily on-par with Civilisation.
              
A Falcon version will ensue afterwards of course.
              
OUTRIDER FALCON
This looks sexy! True Colour graphics, raytraced unit pieces and 
emotive music and sound fx.  Everything is in place, the code is 
almost done and I'll be sending you sample screen shots very soon.

DARK RITUAL     
This is a working-title (but sounds good so will probably stay used) 
and it's a spanking new role playing game much like the Bard's Tale 
adventures.  Again a Falcon version will follow but this one is 
going to take a fair few months of development yet, although a 
preview version is out.

We will probably release a full version of the Falcon STOS extension
too. New versions of this powerful extension include the ability to
play FLI files!  Not bad for STOS huh?  Also NTK4 mod playing routines
are to be added and so are Alpha-channel effects for sprites 
(ie transparent).

Oh yeah the new email address for FOG is :-

And  so,   the  end  is  here,   as  a  particularly  scrappy  and 
inconclusive  'previews' column draws to a close..  There will  be 
some  more info on preview productions in the scene news  document 
done by Leon over the previous months which will also contain more 
general  info  about new demos and other productions  as  well  as 
games..

  CiH.. '95 and '96
