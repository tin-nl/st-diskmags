      (Double set, double set, gotta get a double set!) 

This  very extensive CD-ROM collection is the combined  gatherings 
of  the  Suzy B public domain library on to  two  CD-ROMs..  Those 
people  familiar  with  the  online  publication  'Atari  Explorer 
Online' will also be familar with the ongoing regular column, 'The 
Unabashed  Atariophile',  written  by Michael  Burkley..  Probably 
providing  some  of  the  best reviews  and  descriptions  in  the 
business,  he  keeps AEO from tipping over completely into being a 
press   office   for   old   recycled   Atari-originated    Jaguar 
announcements,  and  makes it still worthwhile for the rest of  us 
Atari  computer users..  The 'Suzy B' handle comes from his  wife, 
Susan Burkley,  who runs the PD library..  You can read more about 
Michael and his life in the Maggie interview later in this  issue, 
but to return to the subject in hand, the CD collection!!

Produced  in association with Toad Computers in the USA,  imported 
by  System Solutions et al over here,  the Suzy B's Atari Software 
Treasury is available as a double disk set, the last RRP I saw was 
a shade under œ50..  We were a bit luckier,  as ours came directly 
from the man himself in America!

(Shall  we  just call it 'Treasury' from now  on?  Saves  keyboard 
wear.. - ED)  

The Treasury has a very different feel from the other  collections 
reviewed in this issue of Maggie.. A raft of headings include most 
of  the  usual  categories,   games,   Falcon  stuff,  programming 
utilities  and  more  in that vein..  Michael  also  has  included 
several  categories  unique  to these disks  as  well..  Take  for 
example,  a dedicated section for Christian software,  and picture 
files, also several categories for specific shareware authors such 
as the Lefebrvre series of utilities written by several members of 
the  same  family.  The  entire Double Click  series  (DCS),  Dave 
Brumleve's  Kidstuff programs,  and no doubt,  several of the Dave 
Munsie epics as well..

There  is  a  lot of generic material,  with a  lot  of  pictures, 
modfiles, animations and textfiles on there.. Much of the material 
is ST-related, with dozens of .NEO, .PI1, and .SEQ files on there, 
albeit with players of viewers that (mostly) run on the Falcon  as 
well..  There are also a lot of .WAV type sound files,  which tend 
to  fill out most collections,  even a folder full of TCB modules, 
and you can all run away and scream now!!

There  is a high proportion of useful stuff,  a specific STOS area 
on  disk,  and  quite a lot of clipart or .IMG files of  different 
species,  and  even  a wide selection of Calamus Fonts (which  are 
registerable  if used often..) Another 'oddball' category  is  the 
NASA  folder which has a load of miscellaneous material about  the 
Space  Agency  concerned..  There is even a selection  of  reading 
matter,  including  several  issues  of AEO,  and a collection  of 
textfiles which yielded up, amongst other things, some rather good 
(and not quite so good) Startrek related items..  For those people 
not  either  with  a  CD-ROM,  or online,  these files  should  be 
appearing  in a future issue of the ST specific  Trekzine  'Warp', 
hopefully  by  the end of '95,  if a cloud of depression does  not 
totally overcome the editor of that mag in the meantime..

The  Falcon  stuff  is  not hugely up to date,  not  in  the  same 
category  as  'Transmission',  which  is a very specific  sort  of 
collection  anyway..  The  date for pressing this edition  of  the 
Treasury  is given tentatively as March 1995,  although with  some 
suggestion  that  the contents had been largely decided  by  'Fall 
1994'(*).. 

(*It's called 'Autumn' over here!  'Fall' is something that you do 
down  the  stairs!!  -  CiH,  reactionary guardian of the  English 
Language. Death to creeping americanisms!!*) 

However,  Michael  does  spring another surprise on us,  as he has 
left his options open right up to the final mastering and pressing 
with  an 'Extras' folder which includes very recent  additions  to 
the  Suzy  B  catalog(ue)..  These even  include  an  unregistered 
version of Towers II,  a very recent addition to the Falcon gaming 
world  at  that time..  I would imagine that the Treasury will  be 
regularly updated in any case..

The  contents of both disks reflects the hugely diverse nature  of 
what  is  available in the Atari PD scene,  some of the files  are 
very  old  indeed,  and  seem  to be a  potted  history  of  long-
forgotten,    but   still   possibly   useful   applications   and 
entertainment  software..  Some files are more recent arrivals  on 
the disk..

Where this collection really scores above all the others to  date, 
is  in  the excellent descriptions provided of all the  pieces  of 
data on the disk.. These are, of course, the reviews gathered from 
many issues of AEO, snipped into thousands of tiny paragraphs, and 
placed  lovingly in a sub-folder with the item in question..  Some 
descriptions  are  very  useful as a quick guide  to  the  program 
concerned,  although  by the time he gets to describing individual 
modfiles,  the exhaustion is plain to see,  descriptions along the 
lines  of  'Rather  sober  and  distant  sounding'  is  clearly  a 
pointless  use  of both disk and human resources..  (If anyone  is 
going  to catalog(ue) individual modfiles,  a little knowledge  of 
the respective ST and Amiga demo coding scenes might not go  amiss 
in the descriptions either..) 

However,  this  is but a small grumble,  as it is very pleasing to 
see  descriptions  which are both extensive,  and not  written  in 
German!!

Most of the files are set up to run off the disk,  not all of them 
co-operate,  especially  in the Falcon section,  or on the Falcon, 
due  to  the  usual age/TOS related  features..  However,  it  was 
possible to play modfiles,  and run animations off the disk, along 
with  quite  a  lot  of programs,  and I would  imagine  that  the 
compatibility  strike rate (*) would increase if the CD is  hooked 
up to an ST..  This compatibility does include Maggie 14, which is 
found on one of the CDs as well..

(*) Baseball reference!! - Naughty!! - Ed..)

The  layout is mostly logical,  but takes the idea of layering and 
sub-directories  much  further  than any other  disk  produced  to 
date.. Even individual .MOD and picture files get their own little 
folder,  and  I would have personally preferred data,  as distinct 
from  programs and applications to be lumped together for ease  of 
access..  Sometimes,  it  is  quite easy to get lost and  confused 
especially in the 'Extras' section, as this has its own sub-set of 
directories,  so  you  momentarily  think  you  are  in  the  root 
main directory when you are not..

Diskmags  tends to get allocated into some strange places,  as one 
Maggie  issue  (issue 10) was found in  'animations',   demos  are 
found  there  as well,  there is no specific category for  demos.. 
Some other issues of Maggie are elsewhere on disk..  Sometimes, it 
seems that it is not really the intention that you are expected to 
locate a specific file, but instead to browse a section of disk to 
see  what wonderful surprises lie in wait..  The slogan "Where  do 
you  want  to go today" seems to have been  grabbed  from  Michael 
Burkley  by MicroSoft!  Copyright issues on the edge of  exploding 
perhaps??

Fortunately, the user is very rarely disappointed..

Ratings..

Content:- 92% - A huge range of software and other goodies for the 
Atari..  A  lot  files for nostalgia trippers,  but some genuinely 
useful  items as well..  More 'generic' text and picture files  of 
different  kinds  not normally seen on collections of  this  kind, 
strong  DTP  flavour  in parts,  an average to  reasonable  Falcon 
section.. 

Ease  of Access:- 75% - Excellent and English  documentation,  the 
very  best  descriptions  of any  collection..  Some  oddities  in 
layout,  over-'foldering' of individual files..  Some parts of the 
disk confusing in places..

Overall:-  88%  -  A  really  attractively  presented  collection, 
Michael Burkley really makes you want to pick up and test out  the 
different  programs and applications..  Perhaps he should try  his 
luck  with  the Atari marketing dept!  Who knows??  A better value 
collection for ST owners over Falcon owners,  go on,  you know you 
want to have a go!!
