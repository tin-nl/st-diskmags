                                ISHIDO

                   THE WAY OF THE STONES (ST REMIX)


The game that took the Lynx world  by  storm has been converted to the
home computer. Well, perhaps that was  a  bit of an exaggeration - the
game that rocked the Lynx world. No,  too dramatic. The game that most
of the Lynx world ignored is now on the home computer!

Ishido is a tile based puzzle board.  You  have a grid on which to lay
tiles. On every level you have  to  lay  a  number of tiles before the
time limit runs out. Tiles can only  placed adjacent to other tiles of
the same colour or design,  so  once  the  board  starts to fill up it
becomes harder and harder to place  tiles. The concept is simple, like
all good puzzle games. I was intrigued  to see how good the conversion
was.

Even though the game is  coded  in  STOS,  the French coding team "The
Megabusters" have done a good  job.  The  intro screens look very nice
and the presentation on the main menu  is of a very high standard. The
sub menus do  let  things  down  a  bit  though.  The  main  font used
throughout the game is nicely defined.

The game itself is  pretty  much  a  straight  conversion  of the Lynx
original. The score panel looks much  nicer, but apart from that there
are no other effects to suggest the game has been majorly updated. The
only real  hint  at  the  coders  demo  routs  is  the  legend "LAMER"
displayed if you quit a game. (It's funny but that word sounds kind of
anachronistic these days)

The game runs on all ataris from  STFMs, STEs through TTs and even the
Falcon.  Falcon  owners  get  some  lovely  8  channel  tracker music,
whereas on the STE and TT  you  have  a 4 channel module. Impoverished
STFM owners have to make do  with  silence, but they are probably deaf
by now after a decade of listening to Mad Max tunes at high volume.

This game may have been overlooked  by  many  on the Lynx - it doesn't
really grab you on the first play like  a Tetris, but give it a chance
and it will start to hook  its  claws  into  you and reel you in. Once
you've played a couple of rounds  you'll  want  to  be bit. There is a
high score table to fill up,  which  also  saves the date of the score
(cool touch).

I must admit that I approached  this  game with a very sceptical mind,
especially as it was written in  STOS  and  geared to work on the STFM
and I hadn't been a huge fan of the Lynx original. But as I started to
evaluate the  game  for  reviewing  purposes  I  found  myself  really
enjoying it and playing "just one  more  level" (much to the annoyance
of Ripley who was waiting  to  play  me  at  Magic  with her new Serra
Angel). If it can keep me away from Magic it can't be bad at all!

Perhaps this game lacks the demo style  extras you would expect from a
team like MegaBusters,  but  it  is  still  a  lot  of  fun,  and with
registration at only œ3 its got to be worth it.
