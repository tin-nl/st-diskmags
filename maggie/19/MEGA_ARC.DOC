

                  The Mega Archive 2 CD-ROM.. 

Another  in  a series of blindingly round and shiny  data  storage 
objects up for review..

This  collection  was  compiled by the  justly  well-known  System 
Solutions,  here in the UK,  and is basically a collection of much 
of what is on the University of Michigan Atari archive,  often the 
first stopping-off point for anyone with a newly purchased  modem, 
an Atari, and a desire to download until they explode..

Here,  the collection has been reproduced without you having to go 
to  the  trouble  of  untold hours  of  telephone  bills,  and  is 
economically   reproduced  onto  one  CD-ROM  for  your   browsing 
pleasure..

The amount of data,  and number of categories under which it lies, 
is  massive,  virtually all files are in a compressed or  archived 
format,  usually  .ZIP,  but  quite  a  lot of .MSA  files  to  be 
unarchived straight onto floppy for the demos..  You would need to 
get  a  double set,  such as the Suzy B disk to get close  to  the 
amounts  of data kept on here,  and you may also like to know that 
there is very little 'padding out' seen on some other collections, 
very  few  picture  files  or  animations,  although  there  is  a 
reasonable   sized  collection  of  modfiles,   mostly  of   Amiga 
parentage,  and  found in various places on the electronic ether?? 

(In  a  more  detailed look,  a lot of these modfiles seem  to  be 
severely  and irredemably corrupted,  a problem with the  original 
archive from whence they came??)
 
A very high proportion of utilities of different kinds on here, as 
they lie under several different categories,  from disk utilities, 
to programming languages, MultiTOS and LINUX applications, network 
and telecomms stuff, even a section for the Atari Portfolio with a 
richness of software for that neglected platform, which would give 
the average Portfolio owner a whole new outlook on their machine.. 
Not  to mention the scores of text editors,  third party fixes  to 
Atari  mess-ups,   music  utilities,  art  packages  and  graphics 
utilities and printing applications..

Separate Atari sub-species are catered for,  with sections for TT, 
STE,  and  of  course,  Falcon,  the  latter of these having a 'CD 
within  a CD' collection with its own subdirectories for the  very 
machine-specific  programs..  There  also is a large  section  for 
owners of the 8-bit machines,  which looks like it is very densely 
populated as well..  In the strictly put in to make up the numbers 
category,  are folders for both Jaguar and Lynx, with pictures and 
textual information on various games on both machines..

Games and demos?  Yes there are, with two large folders for these, 
and   quite   a   decent  collection  of  both   (games,   as   in 
freeware/PD/Shareware,  not  the commercial full-price  variety!!) 
Not  quite  every demo you ever saw,  but a good sized  collection 
with some of the most famous examples of the demo makers craft  in 
there..

Disk  mags are not represented by their own category,  but may  be 
found  in  different places,  some issues of Maggie,  nine ten and 
eleven  for  some obscure reason,  are to be found under  'demos', 
whereas  the  Falcon  Owners Group magazine,  Update  Digital,  is 
living in the Falcon folder..

Documentation is functional,  and most welcome, in English, as the 
original index textfiles describing what is each section are  made 
available  on  the  disk.  Descriptions tend to be one  line,  and 
written  with a USA bias in the descriptions department..  Not too 
bad  at all with a good 'summing up in a sentence'  approach,  but 
not quite on the same level as the excellent descriptions given on 
the Suzy B CD-ROM..

Content:-  90%  - A huge amount crammed onto  the  disk,  stuffed, 
archived,  and the box jumped up and down on until the lid finally 
closed  shut..  Very good for those odd little utilities that have 
accumulated  over  the  years,  to fix a particular problem  of  a 
particular  TOS version..  Almost all Ataris except possibly,  the 
2600 VCS console catered for to some extent or other..

Ease  of Access:- 77% - Good logical and easy to follow  directory 
structure..  Description  texts in English,  which is a big bonus! 
Nothing  set up to run off the CD-ROM though,  where file cramming 
has a price to pay..  Files have to be unzipped away from the disk 
(STZIP does not like Extendos at all) or reconstructed onto floppy 
if  they are MSA archives..  Not a CD for casual browsing like the 
Suzy  B disk..  You have to be pretty sure what you want from this 
disk when you go to explore!!

Overall:- 88% - A really solid collection for the more solid  sort 
of Atari enthusiast..  A great boon to online browsers who can use 
their precious phone time for something less utilitarian,  such as 
pointless   discussions  on  StarTrek/NextGen/DS9  newsgroups   or 
something..
