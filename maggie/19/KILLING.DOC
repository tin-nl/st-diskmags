By  assorted French dudes Rebel Vision and distributed  by  Merlin 
over here, which is pretty decent of them really..

Killing  Impact is a 'Super-Joust' for the Falcon,  featuring good 
use of many of the extra features of that machine, but with a more 
'adventurey'  approach  to  the gameplay,  as you  have  to  fight 
thorugh and complete three levels to make it to the end..

A little man on a space-bike..
Alright, a little man on an 'X-Bot', an atomic-powered exploration 
robot  finds  him/her/it/self  cut  off  from  contact  with   the 
mothership,  and is completely lost on a hostile planet..  It only 
seems  like  a couple of minutes ago that your  were  a  glorified 
management  consultant armed with a phaser,  "assessing  resources 
and  dangers of unexplored worlds"..  Now it looks like that a lot 
of  the local lifeforms would quite like a chance  of  'assessing' 
you!!    

Time  to bounce up and down a lot then,  as the first of many  bad 
guys approaches..

The  time-honoured 'Joust' method of gaining superior  height  and 
jumping  on  the luckless foe is entirely valid here..  The  first 
level  is  a jungle scene,  and several overgrown insects,  flying 
reptiles and others approach..  Some take more than a single whack 
to  destroy  them,  and you are often in a life or death  struggle 
against some quite smart creatures that can follow and mimic  your 
flight  patterns..   There  are  also  several  other  groundbased 
lifeforms  which  add the the merriment by spitting  fireballs  in 
your general direction..

The good news comes when some monsters give out bonuses when  they 
are  killed..  Many give out extra lives or energy top-up bonuses, 
very necessary in places,  others add extra functions and weapons, 
such  as  downward thrusters,  (To increase your hitting power)  a 
laser  and mine which takes a bit too much fiddling about  to  use 
easily, and an instant 'freezer' bomb which makes all the animated 
bud guys in the picture stop, well, animating..

The  level  has to be progressed through,  and at certain  points, 
your way is blocked..  You need keys to open these,  and the right 
monsters  carry  these keys to open the  barriers..  The  'jungle' 
level  expands  to include an underwater scene  with  a  different 
array  of beasties,  and then back into the jungle to confront the 
end  of  level  guardian,  who  is moderately  difficult  to  kill 
(because  he can kill you instantly..) If you complete  that  one, 
there are two, even bigger levels to tackle..

Playability  is fairly well balanced..  The basic Joust  movements 
translate well to this expanded adventure style of play, it is not 
too  difficult  to progress through the level either..  You get  a 
a certain amount of ceiling-scraping anguish and near-misses, when 
a  particularly  adept  bad thing nips smartly out  of  your  way, 
again..  But  hey,  that  was all part of the Joust experience  as 
well!

Graphically,  the  theme  has been well treated,  with 256  colour 
screens showing relatively small but well formed characters,  some 
huge and lusciously coloured backgrounds..  The jungle level being 
particularly  well  done,  and in the first level,  an artist  who 
takes inspiration from the contents of his extensive tropical fish 
and  small  reptile collection for the bad guys..  (This  actually 
works  a  lot better than it sounds,  the end results  are  pretty 
good..)
 
The  second level has a treatment similar to the old  Bitmap  Bros 
game  'Gods'  and it seems to be set in a haunted castle  type  of 
thing..  I've  not got too far there as yet..  The third and final 
level remains completely unknown to me..
      
The  sound  is  a combination of in-game sampled  effects,  and  a 
continuous  DSP-synthesised soundtrack,  a different way of making 
music,  and one that gives over an hours worth of music..  (Albeit 
that a lot of the tunes sounded pretty similar and a little  fuzzy 
in sound resolution..)

Other  general info,  this game can be played both on RGB and VGA, 
the  Jag  joypad is compatible,  and there is also  a  multiplayer 
option  available..  The game is apparently accelerator  friendly, 
and  an accelerated machine is recommended for  multiplayer  games 
with a VGA monitor..  It is hard disk installable, as are most new 
Falcon games now..  The game is fairly customisable with different 
power  settings,  scroll  speeds etc,  if you are still not  quite 
happy with how it plays..

Ratings..

Graphics:-  90%  -  A lot of work put into these..  A  bright  and 
cheerful game drawn by a nature lover for the first level.. Second 
level  alright,  but a bit less novel and exciting as it is mainly 
wall textures..

Sonix:-  80%  -  Good atmospheric  sample  work  ingame,  unusual, 
interesting, and slightly lower KHZ DSP synthesis.. 

Playability:-  91% - Just about right,  the basic 'Joust'  premise 
has  been  held together,  but expanded on,  and developed into an 
adventure game..  Some of the extra weapons a bit difficult to use 
easily..  Does  not seem to be any way of bypassing earlier levels 
once  played,  it seems you have to sit through the whole game  to 
finish it?? Any cheats or passwords in there??

Overall:- 87% - A worthwhile effort for arcade adventurers to  get 
into..
