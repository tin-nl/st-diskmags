 All  characters and events in this parody are fictional, no resemblence to
 persons living or dead or that stupid girl who reviewed games on the first
 series  of "The Net" is intended. Also note that there is no such thing as
 "Happy  Rubber Clog Day" and "Hakkk der oost grobteen jerrdbe" is not real
 Dutch,  it just sounds like it. Eddie's Cat is a fictional character soley
 created to cynically take the piss without being sued. Now read on....




 [Cue  titles,  some hands tapping away at a computer keyboard with 1's and
 0's  appearing  on  the screen, which transform into a logo announcing the
 title "LOG YOUR NET"]


 MALE PRESENTER:
 Hello  and  welcome to this week's edition of "Log your net". I'm the male
 presenter  of  the  programme. And I'll be taking turns saying things with
 her, the female presenter of the programme.

 FEMALE PRESENTER:
 That's  right.  And  now  it's  the  turn  of  the  male  presenter to say
 something.

 MALE PRESENTER:
 In today's programme, we investigate the super information highway, take a
 look at the latest multi-media offerings, plus a special feature on one of
 Britain's top software houses, WideExpanseOfWater Ltd.

 FEMALE PRESENTER:
 But first,the answer to last weeks phone-in comptetition. The question was
 "What  does CD ROM stand for?". The correct answer is, of course, "Compact
 Disk Read-Only Memory", and not, "hiked-up prices and lots of useless full
 motion video" as some who phoned in said, ha ha.

 MALE PRESENTER:
 We've got a lot to pack into this week's programme, but first we have this
 weeks news...

                                 *  *  *  *

 VOICEOVER:
 The biggest news of the week is, of course, the relase of "Bindows '95 and
 6  months",  "Bindows  '95"  took  the  market by storm, by offering loyal
 PC-owners   something   new  to  brag  about  to  their  friends,  and  by
 intergrating   an  operating  system  with  a  graphical  user  interface,
 something  that  was  previously  only  available  on  expensive  high-end
 machines  such  as  the  Atari  520STFM.  But now the waiting is over, the
 latest version is released, this new version offers many improvements over
 the original "Bindows '95", including:

  o Automatic deletion of non-MonopolySoft software from your hard drive.
  o Most bugs in the original "Bindows '95" have been fixed.
  o Some bugs left in to encourage sales of the next version.

 Monopoloysoft  expect  sales  of  over  200,000  in  the first week alone,
 followed  by  400,000  Sad-Dads  bragging  about it afterwards in the week
 after that.



 Tragedy struck the offices of Vulture Publishing today as the entire staff
 of  the  well-respected game magazine The Egg committed suicide by jumping
 from  their  17th  floor  office window. The exact reason behind the three
 deaths  are  not known, but are believed to be connected to the accidental
 sale  of  copies of The Egg without its' usual sealed plastic bag on. This
 allowed  potential  buyers  to leaf through the magazine at the newsagents
 and assess the quality of journalism in the magazine before purchasing it.
 Consequently, the latest issue of The Egg sold exactly 5 copies worldwide.
 Tributes poured in today to the three dead staffers, here is a selection:

 "Throughout  its' history, The Egg always gave fair and unbiased reportage
 to  whatever  console  it was pushing that month. Its' policy of reviewing
 screenshots  of  games  was  widely admired in the industry and it will be
 missed." - Gary Vermoosh, Bogbrush International.

 "I'll  never  forget  the first issue of Egg that I bought. I tore off the
 plastic  bag  and  marvelled  at  the  silky  smooth  feel of the cover. I
 immeadiately  dropped  to  my knees and shouted to the heavens- "Thank you
 God!  This  magazine  is  the  best thing that's ever happened to me in my
 life!".  I  was amazed by the high quality of paper it was printed on. One
 day  I  might  even  get around to reading it." - Pete Ponytail, CrapOSoft
 Interactive.



 And  finally,  on  a  lighter  note,  Holland  has  just  celebrated their
 equivalent  of  our  April  Fool's  Day, "Hakkk der oost grobteen jerrdbe"
 (which  roughly  translates  as  "Happy Rubber Clog Day") with a number of
 computer-related  japes, the most famous of which involved the Dutch Atari
 magazine,  "Dej Dutch Atari Magazziiine" publishing a picture of an IBM PC
 with  an Atari sticker on it, and convincing its' readership that it was a
 new  computer  called  the  Atari Microbox. Many otherwise sensible people
 were  took  in  by  the joke, which included specifications such as custom
 chips that run at a third of the processor's clock rate to speed it up and
 a  facility  for  cooking  pizza as you type, with its' built-in microwave
 oven.

 [Lots  of  flashy  graphics  announce a feature on WideExpanseOfWater Ltd.
 Lots  of  computer  game  footage  of  small  sprites  jumping  about some
 platforms etc.]

 FEMALE PRESENTER:
 In  the  past 15 years, WideExpanseOfWater Ltd. has risen to become one of
 the  best-known  developers  of leisure interactive software creations, or
 "games" as they used to be known. We talk to its boss, Dave Suit about the
 companys' history and future plans.

 [We see Dave Suit. He is a bloke called Dave wearing a suit.]

 DAVE SUIT:
 We  started  off,  all  those  years ago, producing games for the Sinclair
 Spectrum,  like "Mr. Chip Shop" and "1D Golf", which was the first game to
 feature  1D  graphics,  of  course  3D graphics hadn't been invented then!
 [Laughs]
 Since  then,  we've been responsible for a wide variety of games including
 such  well-remembered  romps  as "Sooty and Sweep visit platform land" and
 "Remains of the Day - the video game".

 OFFSCREEN REPEORTER'S VOICE:
 How's your company adapted to meet the changing marketplace of interactive
 entertainment, as it's grown over the years?

 DAVE SUIT:
 Of  course  one  of  the biggest problems in running a successful software
 company  is what to spend the enormous amounts of money we make on. In the
 past  this  usually  went  on  expensive  sports  cars, but recently we've
 developed an interest in Silicon Graphics Workstations, these machines are
 great,  not  only do they cost lots of money but you can fiddle about with
 them all day making pretty pictures instead of writing decent games. We've
 found  they  can  really speed up the production of software, all we do is
 spend  8 months making a raytraced animated intro with the SGI then at the
 last  minute  we bolt on a mediocre game the junior teaboy programmed over
 the  weekend,  and  the  kids love it! Oh by the way, have you noticed how
 games are becoming more and more like films?

 OFFSCREEN REPORTER'S VOICE:
 So, what concepts are you "interfacing" with now?

 DAVE SUIT:
 Sorry?

 OFFSCREEN REPORTER'S VOICE:
 Er,...What's your latest game?

 DAVE SUIT:
 Well  our  latest  project  is something quite unusual for us, it's a film
 licence,  based on the hit movie Reservoir Dogs. It's an exciting platform
 type-romp  where  you must fight your way across seven levels of warehouse
 action,  shooting  people  and swearing, only to fight the big boss at the
 end  of  the  level.  Extra points can be earned by collecting the letters
 that  are  scattered  about, to spell swear words uttered in the film, and
 there is a special bonus stage where you have to cut off a policeman's ear
 while  dancing  to  "Stuck  in the middle with you". We've developed a new
 technique  for  the  graphics,  when a baddie gets hit by your bullets, he
 flashes  white  for  a  bit  and,  at  the start of the level, your sprite
 flickers  on  and  off  for a few seconds to show that you are invincible.
 We're very excited about it.

 OFFSCREEN REPORTER'S VOICE:
 Dave Suit, thanks for taking to us.

 [Back to the studio.]

 MALE PRESENTER:
 And  with  companies  like WideExpanseOfWater Ltd. it's no wonder that the
 U.K.  leads  the  world  in  games  production. And don't miss next weeks'
 feature  when  we  will  be interviewing Tom Thumper of Well-Done Software
 about  their  latest  misleading  set of raytraced screenshots for the new
 Ultastic 28 console.

                                 *  *  *  *

 FEMALE PRESENTER:
 Well,  if  you're  a PC-owning parent of a young child, you'll no doubt be
 aware   that   if  you  don't  expose  your  infant  to  some  multi-media
 "edutainment"  packages  your  offspring  will  grow  up  to be a retarded
 cabbage,  who  will  never  get a job or be able to function in tomorrows'
 techno-packed  future.  With  this  in mind, we've got a typical PC-owning
 family  into  the studio to try out some expensive CD-ROMs to see how they
 fare.

 [Around  a  PC  sit  a bloke with a beard wearing a chunky jumper and a "I
 drink  real  ale" badge and a woman dressed like Sue Cook off "Crimewatch"
 with a bored toddler wriggling about on her knee.]

 PC DAD:
 Hi,  we've  bought  Daniel  some  new learning aids and he's enjoying them
 enormously.

 [Daniel  The Toddler is meanwhile getting great fun out of getting hold of
 one  of  the  empty  cardboard  boxes  the  CD-ROMs came in and hitting it
 against the desk.]

 PC MUM:
 Look Daniel, this is MonopolySoft's Farm Animals '95, see the chicken?

 [On  the  screen a picture of a chicken appears and an american voice says
 "Gee  look  aht  thayt  therre  chicken. "Puck puck puck" sayes this heere
 chicken."]

 PC DAD:
 Isn't that great?

 PC MUM:
 Yes, and it's so important for his mental development. In the future, when
 he  has  to  pilot  his  hovercar to his office on the moon every morning,
 he'll thank us for this!

 [Daniel  is totally ignoring the computer screen, and is now trying to eat
 the  mouse.  His  parents, however are totally enthralled by the colourful
 pictures and happy childish music that emits from the PC.]


 [At  this point, you change the channel in disgust and catch the middle of
 a  current  affairs  type  debate on the other side, about whether playing
 console games turns kids into violent psychopaths. The panel is made up as
 usual  of  a patronising teacher of some sort, who is obviously pissed off
 because  most  12  year-olds  know more about technology than he does, and
 representing the games industry, the Redcoat from Hell, Dominic "Diseased"
 Diamond.  Dominic is sporting his new, very short, haircut to disguise the
 fact  that he is only about 25 and already is going bald. The conversation
 goes something like this...]

 TEACHER:
 I  represent  the Professional Association of Smartarse Teachers, and many
 of  us  have  noticed that the children we teach are becoming increasingly
 violent and disruptive as a result of playing video games.

 DIAMOND:
 Aww.. that's just not true. You're only saying that because you want to be
 on telly like me.

 TEACHER:
 That  is  not  true. 6 months ago, before video games were invented, there
 were  no incidents of bullying or fighting in any British school, nowadays
 playgrounds  all  over the country reverberate to the sounds of kiddy-guts
 splashing  onto  the  floor. I've had to confiscate all dangerous handheld
 videogames  like  this:  [holds up a pocket calculator] just to protect my
 pupils from themselves.

 DIAMOND:
 That's  a  pocket  calculator,  you  can't  play games on that. Ha, ha, he
 thinks a calculator is a Nintendo Gameboy or something!

 TEACHER:
 Don't  try  to  trick  me,  we  all  know the evil technology can do. Only
 yesterday  I programmed the timer on the complicated school video recorder
 wrongly  and  the  entire  class  laughed,  causing  a  severe  breach  of
 disipline.  It's  the  sort  of thing like this that is making us teachers
 look like total idiots...er...I mean making pupils violent and unruly. And
 of course, there is the issue of computer pornography...

 DIAMOND:
 Great! Nudie birds!

 TEACHER:
 We've  all  seen  how  it works, children pass around "floppy" disks which
 have pornography on them and stuff on how to build bombs too for when they
 get  bored  of the pornography, and swap them in the playground. When they
 get  home,  they  stuff  the  disks into the cartridge slot of their Super
 Nintendoscope  consoles  and  the  television  shows pictures of Sonic the
 Hedgehog with no clothes on....

 DOMINIC DIAMOND:
 But where's the nudie birds? Are they really fit like the ones I've got on
 my show "Gamesmaster"?

 [You  change  the  channel  back  to  "Log  your net" just in time for the
 regular games review slot...]

                                 *  *  *  *

 MALE PRESENTER:
 And  now  our  games reviewer takes a look at the latest game for the Saga
 Sooturn super console, the exciting 3D shoot-em-up "Virtua Prawnfish".

 [Cue  cartoony "rave"-type music and a silly girl running about in a field
 filmed with a distorting lens on the camera]

 SOPHIE RICHPARENTS:
 Hi  it's  me  again, I failed my exams and couldn't get into college so my
 Dad  who's  a producer on this show got me this job instead! And here's my
 co-presenter Digital Dog!

 [A  badly-animated  raytraced robotic dog appears and with the aid of some
 video  effects  spins  around  the presenters head while making electronic
 barking noises]

 DIGITAL DOG:
 Woof! Woof!

 SOPHIE RICHPARENTS:
 Don't worry viewers he may look fierce, but he doesn't "byte"!

 DIGITAL DOG:
 Woof! Woof!

 SOPHIE RICHPARENTS:
 This  week  we've  got  "Virtua Prawnfish". It's a 3D shoot-em-up were you
 play  a  prawn  who  battles  against evil mutated seaweed controlled by a
 starfish  from  outer-space or something, anyway here's what our reviewers
 think:

 [Some  children  appear  on  screen  looking uncomfortable in front of the
 camera]

 GIRL REVIEWER:
 This  game  has brilliant graphics but there isn't much to do. The music's
 good though.

 BOY REVIEWER:
 At  first  when you see the screen shots of this game in the magazines you
 think  it  will  be  great  but once you play it you find the novelty soon
 fades and all you have is a boring shoot-em-up.

 VERY YOUNG CHILD REVIEWER:
 I think it is good but I love my teddy bears better.

 SOPHIE RICHPARENTS:
 Well lets see what our games guru, Barry Smug who edits SagaSuperFantastic
 magazine thinks of it:

 [Cue shot of lazy-looking McDonalds staff reject with lots of little icons
 superimposed around the screen]

 BARRY SMUG:
 Well,  I  can't quite understand the opinions of your reviewers, Saga have
 spent  a  lot  of  money  on the graphics and sound and this is considered
 quite  a  cutting-edge  product in the industry. I give it full marks. Are
 you  sure  these  are  real  game-playing  kids?  They're not even wearing
 baseball  caps  backwards  or  anything.  And what are girls doing playing
 games anyway? Shouldn't they be playing with their dolls instead?

 [Back  to  idiot  presenter  who  hasn't  noticed  his patronising remarks
 because she's too busy trying to remember her next line]

 SOPHIE RICHPARENTS:
 So Digital Dog, let's have the scores!

 DIGITAL DOG:
 [Zooming about the screen for no reason whatsoever] Woof Woof!

 SILLY COMPUTER VOICE:

   Graphics    99%
   Sound       98%
   Lastabilty  96%

  Final Rating: Durrr--Beep! Not So Good

 SOPHIE RICHPARENTS:
 Well  that's all for now, we don't want to get booor-rinnnggg by having an
 item aimed at kids lasting more than 13 seconds now do we? Byeeee!

 DIGITAL DOG:
 [Lying on its' back waving its legs about] Woof Woof!

 [More  rave music and wobbly camera shots of presenter intently prodding a
 joypad that isn't plugged in to anything.]

                               *  *  *  *

 [Back to the studio with a bloke cautiously messing about with a PC in the
 corner.  It  is  ALAN,  the  bloke  who's  on the show because he's new to
 computers  and  viewers  who  don't know anything about them can relate to
 him.]

 MALE PRESENTER:
 The  Internet,  most  of us have heard something about it, some of us will
 have  used  it,  but  what are the most interesting "sites" at the moment?
 Alan,  you're  a  new user, or a "newbie" as we "net-heads" say, what have
 you found?

 ALAN:
 I've  discovered  that  if  you move this little box around on the desk, a
 little  arrow  on the screen moves about too! And the clever thing is, the
 box, called a "mouse" doesn't even look like an arrow!

 MALE PRESENTER:
 Hmm, yes, very interesting, but what "hot" "home-pages" have you found?

 ALAN:
 Well  there's  a  great range of interests on this super-highway computer,
 whatever your interest, you can find it here.

 [Screen of PC shows a 'net viewer displaying a textfile headed "Startrek -
 Science Fiction... or Future Science Fact?".]

 ALAN:
 The  other  night  I  read  a  fascinating article about basket-weaving in
 Southern California, it was amazing because little pictures came up on the
 screen  and  they had words printed next to them that you could read. It's
 much  better  quality  than  Ceefax.  And  I'm  learning  to type a little
 sideways  smiley  face with the keyboard :') and make pictures of cows out
 of letters and punctuation marks. I think -

 [MALE PRESENTER looks embarrassed and cuts him off in mid-sentence]

 MALE PRESENTER:
 Er...  So  that's about all for now, but if YOU want to get onto the super
 internet  highway,  don't  worry it's not as complicated as you think, all
 you need is a computer, one like this will do...

 [Indicates the PC which has just crashed. ALAN thinks he has broken it and
 starts to cry]

 MALE PRESENTER:
 ...  or any other type of PC-compatable. For further details you can write
 off  for our 16 page information booklet that costs œ3.50 - the address is
 coming  up at the end of the program. And don't forget you can now use our
 internet  address  to "e-mail" us, just mark the envelope "E-MAIL" and the
 postman will put it in the special E-Mail post van for you.
 And finally, this week's phone in competition is:

                    "How many bytes are in a kilobyte?"

 Calls  are  charged  at 38p per minute cheap rate, 48p at all other times.
 This may involve a long call so that we can make more money out of you.

 FEMALE PRESENTER:
 We'll be back next week with more news and current happenings in the world
 of  information  technology  cyber-tools or "computers" as they used to be
 known, so until then, goodbye!
