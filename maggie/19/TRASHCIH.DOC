In a frantic display  of  grabbing  someone  else's good idea, and
trying to pass it off as  our  own,  we  do  a Maggie version of a
'Room 101' type of thing.. 'Room  101',  for those who don't know,
is a BBC2 TV show,  where  celebrities  of  varying calibre try to
justify their choices of things  they  really  hate being put into
the room in question, Room  101..  Controlling things is the host,
Nick Hancock, Mr Ubiquitous himself.. Oh  yes, and they nicked the
original idea from a radio show of  the  same name, so now its our
turn!

Here, we change the name to 'In the Trash Can', to suggest that in
a future hypothetical  upgrade  to  the  desktop,  those things we
really don't like can be placed in  the bin icon, normally kept in
the bottom left hand  corner  of  your  screen,  NEVER  TO BE SEEN
AGAIN! Otherwise, the rules are pretty similar..

You have a choice of six topics, in this particular version of the
game, two of them are to  be  computer related, but you still have
carte blanche for the rest, so  they  can be anything else that is
particularly bugging you, whether it  be computer related or not..
The format is, that you write a  paragraph (or two, or whatever it
takes) to get the topic off  your  chest,  them me, doing the Nick
Hancock role, will either support or deny entry to the trashcan on
suitably witty and scathing grounds in a following up paragraph..

This way, you won't get to see the full end result before the next
Maggie is published,  but  then  again,  if  'Room  101' is purely
unscripted and made up on the spot, then I'm a Windows '95 user!!

(With regard to the two  computer  related  topics,  a bit of fine
tuning of basic concepts  proved  necessary,  as  an  awful lot of
stuff already lies rotting at the  bottom  of the TRASHCAN.. It is
not really necessary to shove generic types, such as the AMIGA and
PC, and most CONSOLES in there,  as  although  I like to see these
things get slagged off  repeatedly,  these  topics  have been done
before.. Several  times  before,  in  fact..  What  would  be more
interesting,  would  be  a  particular  facet  of  these,  say  an
individual  company,   naff   television   advertising   campaign,
particular individual, group, or type of  person on the scene, any
really awful  software/manuals/magazines,  irritating  hype, etc..
I'm sure a lot more can be added  to the list, but I think you get
the idea by now..)

Off you go!!  Ok, as I'm  going  to  drop this first effort on you
Leon, here's a selection of six of my own candidates for entry, or
not perhaps, to the hallowed halls of trashbin..

First computer related entry..

PSYGNOSIS SOFTWARE.. Psygnosis  deserve  a  special  place  in the
trashcan because they were  the  prototype  for  all the crap that
followed since..

They did a lot of things that have helped make the software market
a less fun place than it ought to be..

To start with, they were once IMAGINE, the scouse wide boys of the
eight  bit  boom,   and   displayed   a   precocious   talent  for
disconnection with  reality  by  trying  to  live  up  to  a flash
tabloidese lifestyle..  They  discovered  the  art  of  hype  over
substance extremely early, with their so-called 'Mega Games' which
promised an early visit to  gaming  Nirvana,  and huge profits for
them etc.. This was not  to  be,  as  they  were  sussed out and a
painful descent into collapse followed..

The 'rump' of Imagine, the  Megagames,  and  two of the directors,
then became Psygnosis..Eventually,  a  'megagame'  popped out from
under the bedclothes, as 'Brataccas'  found  its  way onto the new
68000 based 16 bit  computers  late  in  1985.. Here, their second
claim to notoriety follows.. For a  game  in 1985, we think that a
œ34.95 price tag was  hugely  excessive..  Of  course, it has gone
steadily downhill from there ever since..  This was the first game
also to rely rather too heavily on  Roger Dean box artwork to sell
the dream, and hopefully draw  attention  away from the contents a
bit..   Take a few muffled mouse responses and flash forward a few
years, and you get a lot  of  Amiga owners feeling smug around the
place, shall I mention Wayne 'Blood Money' Smithson, alright then,
I won't.. I will, however, mention  SHADOW  OF THE BEAST a lot, as
we all know too well, Amigas  are  really triff for doing hardware
parallax scrolling and colours and stuff.. And this game had loads
of that, 97 layers of individual  parallax scrolling (some of them
scrolling in an  alternative  universe  where  Sam  Tramiel is the
President of the Atari World Federation, the organisation formerly
known as the United Nations!)

Also there is  5496  meg  of  original  soundtrack, 36,047 colours
onscreen, which was really great for  a  top demo handed around as
public domain, but not so hot when  you forget to add a GAME.. But
if you know how to handle the  reviewing press right, IE , lots of
previews  and  hands-off  multimedia   presentations  and  general
twirling around of  hopeful  bullshit  means  lots  of copies sold
before anyone  properly  reviews  it..  Just  change  the  name to
'Playstation', and that is what you more or less get now..

Psygnosis were never  a  very  'Atari-friendly'  company after the
very early days, and their  port-overs,  which  I won't dignify as
'conversions' were usually very late  and  poorly made.. They were
one of the first companies who  saw  a  future in pointless FMW on
CD-ROM, with their stunning MICROCOSM, which  hit new highs in the
price and box presentation department, and new depths in the minor
matter of gameplay..

The one saving point,  Lemmings,  was  a  case of 'Ocean-itis', or
buying in outside talent, and  the  last  straw  for me came, when
they decided to play bottom  kiss  with  Sony,  and become part of
that Japanese corporate entity..

To sum up, Psygnosis embodied  a  lot  of  what  is wrong with the
current entertainment software  industry,  big  egos,  loud suits,
glossy  superficialty,  an  inappropriate  love  affair  with  big
business, and really, more cash than sense.. PUT IT IN THE BIN!!

(Do your response/thing here..)

[ Nick ] Although Psygnosis really do  deserve to go into the bin,
but I'm afraid they are staying out. (Much booing from audience).

I do remember one  of  Imagine's  only  ST  games, "Victory Road",
being one of the most  pitifully  awful  pieces of software I have
the misfortune to play.

Psygnosis must be one of the  best  known software houses, but you
struggle to think of  a  good  game  they  have released. They did
invent an excellent  system  for  pricing  their  games though. As
their  titles   were   more   expensive   than   those   of  their
contemporaries, they simply made  their  boxes  bigger  as if this
compensated for the 10 pound  differential  in price! I think they
had some formula relating box size  to price, they knew they could
charge whatever they wanted as  long  as  the  box was big enough!
They just had to get Roger Dean  to airbrush a picture big enough.
They managed to sell air with the use of hot air!

They do stand guilty of resurrecting  a form of airbrushed fantasy
artwork they should have died in  the  mid  70s, and for this they
will be serving a suspended trashbin sentence.

Psygnosis are also experts in milking  a product. They produce one
reasonably alright game ("Lemmings") and  the world was so stunned
(The Guardian headline from the  time  "PSYGNOSIS  IN NOT SHIT NEW
GAME SHOCKER) they bought it by the bucket-load. Cash signs lit up
in the eyes  of  the  directors  and  before  we  knew  it  we had
"Lemmings 2",  "Oh  No!  More  Lemmings",  "Even  More  Lemmings",
"Buggering Hell there's more of  those  bastard Lemmings" and "Yes
here are some more small  green  things,  give us all your cash!".
And what  do  you  know,  we  are  getting  "3D  Lemmings"  on the
Playstation, god help  us.  What  next,  "Lemmings  hit the fourth
dimension in desperate  bid  to  raise  extra  cash  for Psygnosis
directors". We can't wait. (In fact we can. For a very long time).

The amazing thing about  Psygnosis  is  that  they  have some very
talented programmers, graphics artists and musicians, and yet they
still manage to  consistently  produce  bobbins.  The  standard of
their work on the ST wasn't  very  high,  but the Amiga stuff, and
even the Lynx stuff was  technically  amazing, and also stunningly
unplayable. I really don't know  how  they  do  it, they have made
making unplayable games into  an  artform.  Lets  face it, neither
"Shadow of the Beast" or any  of  its successors were any good, on
any format.

Anyone who has seen Sony-Psygnosis's (a  name that really rolls of
the tongues) efforts  on  the  playstation  will  feel  a  wave of
heartwarming nostalgia. Yes,  the  music  is  fantastic.  Yes, the
graphics are  exceptional.  And  yes,  the  gameplay  has  gone on
holiday to one of Alpha Centauri's moons. Permanently.

Psygnosis's record on the ST was  pretty  dire. The games came out
so long after the Amiga versions that everyone had forgotten about
them, and they were usually  so  bad  that  those who did remember
them decided to  forget  them  too.  Consequently,  most ST owners
didn't buy Psygnosis games  (with  the  exception  of the Lemmings
series) and fortunately we were spared  from having a lot of their
"games" forced on us. Psygnosis should be congratulated for this.

In their favour, all  their  games  are  originals  - they haven't
resorted to the Ocean cop-out  of  using  Film  names to sell duff
games. One of the main reasons why I am not consigning them to the
trash-bin is  that  there  is  another  Software  company  who are
infinitely worse than Psygnosis.  Yes,  I  am talking about Brum's
finest, "US GOLD" who have  not  only  never released a good game,
each new game seems  to  plum  even  greater  depths of awfulness.
Whilst this Software House  remains  'at  large', Psygnosis can be
smug in the knowledge that  even  though  they  are bad, there are
companies about that are worse.

Also, we can't undervalue  Psygnosis  contribution  to the Tories'
"Care in the Community" campaign.  Just  picture it - thousands of
confused,  disconsolate  Amiga  owners  across  the  country  were
presented new hope and life  with  "Shadow  of  the Beast" and its
ilk. There were pretty pictures for them to look at, nice sound to
listen to, and  a  big,  big  box  to  play  with.  It  kept these
unfortunate people happy for years, and for this valiant effort of
helping the disabled, they should be saluted.

I'm afraid Chris, you are  going  to  have to take these Psygnosis
related goodies home with you.

Hands Chris an "Awesome"  T-Shirt,  Shadow-Of-The-Beast pyjamas, a
huge box emblazoned with Roger  Dean  artwork and a cuddly lemming
toy.
And another lemming.
And another.
And another.
And another...

( goes on for several hours. Audience start to get restless as the
joke wears thin. )



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ The next computer topic  is  a  game  that has amazing powers of
reincarnation, that just refuses to die, even when people realised
after the first five minutes novelty had gone, it was crap, really
crap.. It has been with us for ten or more years, if you count the
arcade laserdisk cabinet, which I will, so ladies and gentlemen, I
give you,,,

DRAGON'S LAIR..

Dragons Lair first saw life  sometime  in  the  dim and dark early
eighties, an  arcade  game  based  around  attempts  to  yield new
gameplaying powers from a  common  laserdisk player.. Dragons Lair
was a very nice  Don  Bluth  cartoon,  which  was  chopped up into
little bite sized game segments of film, selected by a casual left
or right flick of the joystick, life,  or  death at the flick of a
wrist.. This  game  is  THE  grandfather  of  all  the  pretty but
hopeless interactive movie  non-event  games,  and surely deserves
enclosure in the depths of the trashcan, for this fact alone!?!

Anyway, after the first  couple  of  attempts,  most people wisely
dismissed the game  as  a  sumptiously  presented non-event, there
were technical problems with the cabinets, the game faded out into
obscurity..

Come forward a few years,  and  on  a different machine, something
called an Atari ST, talk of  a  CD-ROM adaptation for the abortive
CDAR player emerges.. And goes away  again..  We all breath a sigh
of relief, but not  for  long,  as  ReadySoft  thrust new computer
versions on the world..  Recoloured  and  adapted  to  work on the
Amiga and ST, and also  adapted  for  seventeen changes of disk to
get through the first round..  Amiga  owners reached new levels of
sadness, playing this game,  not  really  because they enjoyed it,
but to maintain some  mistaken  notion  of  'status' in their peer
group by owning a pirate copy of the game, which came on about six
disks.. Excessive for  the  time,  but  a  clear  warning  for the
future..

Dragons Lair is one of  those  things,  like  a really bad case of
athletes foot, that refuses to die..  The latest insult is to hear
that it is now  up  for  release  on  the  Jaguar CD-ROM!! But why
Atari? Surely there are half  a dozen worthwhile development games
that are also chasing for cash,  denied  to them by this graceless
pile of elephant cack!

Dragons Lair, to  summarise,  is  now  a  'classic',  in  the same
mistaken manner of early Cliff  Richard  musicals and 1973 British
Rail timetables.. But who pays attention to THEM anymore, eh??


[ Nick ] Yet again, this  entry  evades  the clutches of the trash
can ( Some hissing is heard ) although it did come close.

Dragons Lair is Psygnosis's idea of  "a really playable game". But
lets face it, everyone knows it isn't a game at all, just a rather
splendid graphical demo.

Ok so it may come on  47  disk,  it  may only require one joystick
movement per screen, but  (in  the  words  of Gladys Allthorpe) by
'eck its gorgeous. The animation  is  out  of  this world, and the
sound too is excellent.

If you enjoy demos, and take Dragons  Lair at face value as just a
graphical demo, then it  is  up  with  the  best. The astronomical
price tag doesn't help.

I must admit to owning another  Don  Bluth  game, Space Ace on the
ST.( much laughing from audience ) No, it was quite good honestly!
It was well coded - the  animation was smooth, graphics superb and
the sound was brilliant. Its not a game, but it does look nice.

The real criminals I feel are  the producers of Multi-tedia CD-ROM
games for the  PC  that  actually  try  to  pretend  there is some
substance to the game play, but it turns out to be another Dragons
Lair with worse graphics. At least with Dragons Lair you know what
you are getting.

I'm afraid Chris you are going to have to take this home with you.
( Hands CIH a cassette )
This is the  much  sought  after,  but  very  rarely  seen, VIC-20
version of Dragons Lair. ( laughter from audience at obvious joke)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ My next topic is one guaranteed to piss some of you off, it is a
group of people who  prefer  to  endure,  rather  than enjoy life,
whose idea of heaven is a  vast  grassy  area ringed with KEEP OFF
THE GRASS signs.. A permanent disapproving  shake of the head, and
admontary wagging finger are never left at home for,,

VEGETARIANS WHO THINK THEY ARE ST JOAN  OF ARC, BUT COME ACROSS AS
GODZILLA.. (But particularly Linda McCartney!)

Hello Linda, you've got a problem, haven't you!

Linda is a vegetarian, which is  fair enough.. Many people decide,
for various practical or moral reasons that they will not eat meat
anymore.. This is fine by  me,  my  personal  view is that society
will increasingly become vegetarian anyway, this will be a process
that will  take  a  number  of  years..  It  may,  or  may  not be
accomplished in my  lifetime,  but  ONLY  will  be accomplished by
gentle persuasion, good  humour,  leading  by  example rather than
dragging by the nose, and  how  about  setting  up a really decent
vegetarian culinary culture  whilst  my  wish  list  is  up on the
page?? I cherish my bacon butties too  much to give them up at the
moment though!

It will not  be  accomplished  by  living  the  life  of a tedious
control freak with little or no sense of humour to speak of!!

Linda McCartney is  a  scream,  apart  from  ramming  a  series of
killjoy statistics down visiting throats  every  time the topic of
food crops up, she has now  decided  that  she does not want to be
TOUCHED by people who have eaten meat when she is on tour!!??!?

Beg pardon, but who actually wishes to handle you!?! Is she busily
inventing some new theory of 'passive eating' where horrible meat-
eaten poisons  pass  into  her  pure  persona  from  the  smallest
physical  contact..  Makes  you  feel  like  downing  a  pound  of
beefburgers, the really  cheap  and  fatty  supermarket  own brand
variety, leaving things  to  'brew'  for  a  few  hours,  and then
popping around to her  house  to  let  off  a series of wholesome,
processed meat farts in her presence..  You  know the sort I mean,
the really horribly rank  flabby  woof-woofs  that  persist in the
atmosphere for months afterwards and  lead to widespread vomiting,
coma, and death! Suck on those Linda baby!

But seriously, sounds a bit  like  Howard  Hughes, the oxygen tent
years.. Is it treatable, will  it  be expensive, worse still, will
it bring  back  the  intolerant  miserable  'crank'  tag  for non-
celebrity veggies, just trying to get  on with their lives?? Would
you like your house dust free as well Linda??

She is one dangerously neurotic  woman,  with  a slight talent for
playing spoons in Paul McCartney's band!!


[ Nick ]  I wonder who does  Linda  McCartney's PR as they must be
the most hopeless public relations  company in existence. Linda is
one of  the  most  reviled  public  figures.  And  most  of  it is
justified.

She is partly responsible  for  a  string  of abysmal singles. Not
only do we have to put up  with  Macca's vocals, but have Linda on
tambourine is a bridge too far.

However she is not going in (  some  dissent in audience ) for the
simple fact that  she  produces  an  exceptionally  tasty  line of
vegetarian food. Traditionally vegetarian  food  has  been awful -
lentil beans, rubbery tofu, tempu and inedible stodge purchased at
exorbitant prices  from  health  food  shops.  If  you  think meat
produces flatulence, just try a bowl of lentils and your anal wind
will quickly clear the vicinity.

However Linda McCartney produces  some  excellent  fast food style
burgers, pies and grills which makes vegetarian food bearable. Its
never going to  replace  the  bacon  butty  but  it certainly does
replace most of the stuff masquerading as healthy vegetarian food.

Also hats off to  Linda  for  playing  the spoons, tambourines and
other kitchen implements in an attempt  to  be viewed as a serious
musician. Linda you are a  buffoon,  and an unknowingly entertaing
one at that.

So Chris, I'm afraid you are  going  to  have  to take this set of
Linda McCartney related goodies with you:

One   Linda   McCartney   horse-meat-flavour-but-vegetarian-honest
burger, one Linda McCartney tambourine, one set of Linda McCartney
musical spoons and a  miniature  model  of  Paul McCartney to take
everywhere with. You can even try  forming your own band with this
combination of goodies!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ The next topic is one dear to everybody's hearts, the worst kind
of hypocrisy  on  display,  that  it  TABLOID  NEWSPAPERS  WHO ARE
CHRONICALLY FIXATED ON A SMALL RANGE OF EXTREMELY NAFF TOPICS..

What is the matter with this  country?  Why does it produce such a
bloody    awful    crowd    of     wasters    as    the    typical
editorial/journalistic team responsible  for  our wonderful gutter
press.. Actually, I feel sorry for  gutters, they perform a useful
and socially necessary job taking waste  water away from under our
feet.. Can the same be said for the majority of newspapers??

Things I don't give a stuff about,  but seem to exercise the minds
of  the   editorial   staff   of   the   Sun/Mirror/News   of  the
Screws/Scumday People etc..

1. A female member of  the  royal  family/minor  soap star, is she
getting fat?

2. A female member of the royal family/minor soap star, is she off
her food and getting a bit thin?

3. My hair transplant hell, by top greyhound fancier..

4. Top Hollywood star and  his  HAMSTER  HAPPY HOUR!! (I think you
know who I mean, but I  must  take  speculation down a gere or two
before things get completely out of hand!)

5. A clergyperson of the Church of England is a bit less rampantly
heterosexual than he ought to be (POOF PRIESTS! - STRING 'EM UP!)

6. Bloke who has been advertising so-called 'wonder slimming cure'
for six months in that paper is finally exposed as a fraud.. (When
he forgets to pay his advertising bills presumably??)

7. A certain blonde female member of the royal family is caught in
the airing cupboard with someone  not  actually her husband, pages
one through nine,  special  feature  on  her  royal marriage hell,
pages 22-25.. (And I think you  KNOW  who  she  is, or hope to Di,
anyway!!!)

8. SPORTS PAGES..  England  national  football  team  manager is a
variety of vegetable (Actually, this might be taken as an argument
in FAVOUR!?)

9. Whingeing overpaid sports "personality" special..

10. Loudmouthed former sports  person,  who  was  once somebody in
their chosen field,  but  now  most  definitely  past their career
sell-by date, moans on about how rotten things are today..

And I could go on for ages, they certainly do..

I'm bored with this topic already, stick it in the bin!


[ Nick ] I have to say  I wholeheartedly agree with you about this
one. ( some clapping from the crowd ).

Lets face it, the  tabloids  are  crap  and  bring  a  bad name to
British journalism. If they  were  just  badly written with poorly
researched articles on dull subjects  it  wouldn't matter so much.
The main problem is the way they campaign on issues from their own
bigoted prejudiced agenda. There react  to  everything on the most
basic level without examining the  more  complex issues, and their
reaction is usually "ban it"  or  "string  them  up". They are the
printed voice of taxi drivers everywhere.

I remember having an  argument  with  an  English student who said
there was no difference between  the  broadsheets and the tabloids
in their representation of any given  story. The tabloids are just
more concise with the same facts  and  the broadsheets pad it out.
Bollocks. The tabloids have less facts, and half of these are made
up.

Probably the worst tabloids  are  not  the  rock  bottom "Sun" and
"Star", but supposedly up-market  "Mail"  and  "Express" which may
snipe at other tabloids, but  are  just  as  royal fixated and are
always whipping up  moral  panics  on  subjects  they  know little
about. "Pornography on the internet" -  it  seems as if anyone who
comes into the briefest closest  with  the  net  is whisked into a
seedy world of paedophilia. Another  example  is the recent Calvin
Klein advertising  campaign  which  featured  some  young  looking
models which they  immediately  branded  as  "Kiddie  Porn". Their
minds must work in very sick ways indeed.

The Royal Family -  who  cares?  Sure  some  of  their more recent
exploits have been entertaining, but do  we need a ten page spread
ever time Princess Di dons a new pair of shoes? I think not.

So the whole set of tabloids can  go into the trash-can with their
overbearing proprietors and  the  lies  they  print  and potential
deathtraps they invent. ( much cheering )



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~ My fifth moan is about a  strange tribe of people who gather in
a most unlikely  setting,  that  is  SHOPPING CENTRE/MALL SECURITY
GUARDS..

Is it the glamour of  the  uniform,  the opportunities for travel?
What do these people actually do??

This dead end post seems tailor  made  for those people who avidly
study 'Soldier of Fortune' magazine  from  cover to cover, but are
too crap in some way or  other  to  take  part in the real thing..
Rejected by the army and  police,  who  after  all, must have some
minimal standards  for  metal  stability  of  potential recruits..
Rejected even by the Serbs because they  are too worrying to be of
use even there, the last port  of  call  is the honoured post of a
shopping centre security guard..

The uniform seems to be a  comic  opera fantasy design, knocked up
by someone who has  spent  too  much  time  watching old reruns of
period 'seventies TV cop shows.. It  is just so, well, American in
a cheesy, awful, plastic way, and  makes the wearer look like they
are playing pretend 'cops, which in their mind, they are..

The job seems to  entail  standing  around  and mentally pulling a
.357 Smith and Wesson Magnum,  on  the  hordes of undesirables who
loiter in the darker corners of  the shopping centre, not that the
job would attract quasi-fascist fantasists of course!!

When these people grow up, they become ticket inspectors!!


[ Nick ] Security Guards - hate  'em or hate 'em, they have become
a feature of shopping centres,  and  a  rather annoying feature at
that.

I think they should model themselves  more  on 70s cop shows, that
would be a vast improvement. Flares should be a compulsory part of
the uniform, as should  big  hair.  They  should  be surrounded by
burger bags and  polystyrene  cups  of  coffee  as  they stake-out
potential shopping mall perps. They should then spring into action
to funky 70s tunes sending  carefully  pre-stacked boxes flying as
they chase kids up and down  shopping  centres. It could also lead
to the welcome resurrection of Huggy Bear.

Security Guards also fancy themselves as have-a-go-heroes (another
awful phrase of tabloid invention)  and  will willingly pile-in at
the slightest provocation,  so  often  end  up  in the magistrates
court.

"And your defence for GBH on this  4  year old child is?" asks the
judge.

"He was giving me lip so I did him!"

And the next case comes up...

"He hung around  in  Smiths  reading  magazines  for hours without
buying any, SO I DID HIM!"

Even those behind the counter  are  not  exempt from the vigilante
streak of security guards

"He short-changed the woman SO I DID HIM!"

Security Guards are big mates with taxi drivers, love the tabloids
and believe "hanging is too good  for  them" - and that's just for
people who read magazines in newsagents without buying anything.

And of course the vocation  of  security  guards  led to the truly
dreadful "Comedy" Nightingales,  and  for  this  reason alone they
deserve to be consigned  to  the  trash-can.  ( much cheering from
crowd. Some grunts from  thuggish  looking  characters at front of
audience who are obviously security  guards by occupation. Mutters
of "That Nick Hancock, I'M GOING TO DO HIM!" )


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~ Finally, the last topic for the trashbin..

Michael Hutchens, PISS OFF BACK TO  AUSTRALIA, AND TAKE THAT YO-YO
KNICKERED POP TART, PAULA YATES WITH YOU!!

Aw, who's gonna give a toss about them by the time this issue gets
out anyway!!


[ Nick ] You  will  be  pleased  to  know  that  I  am letting Mr.
Hutchens in. ( much cheering from audience ).

This is not because of his taste  in  women ( however bad that may
be ) but mainly because INXS  are  such  a bloody awful band. They
really produce the most dreadful MOR daytime-radio oriented dross.
And their name: INKS? INCESS? INCEST? What is it all about?

Also they  are  Australians,  and  thus  come  from  the  land  of
Kangaroos, convicts and  "Home  and  Away"  and thus automatically
qualify for trashcan.  (  cue  flood  of  angry  letters to Maggie
about whingeing poms )

And they always beat us at cricket  so  it is nice to get one over
them - Mr Hutchens get  into  the  dustbin!  (  crowd go wild with
enthusiasm )


So Chris you have done pretty well.
Psygnosis, Dragons  Lair  and  Linda  McCartney  have  escaped the
depths of the dustbin,  but  you  did  manage  to  rid yourself of
Tabloids, Security Guards and that bloke from INXS.

-- Next Issue!!-- It  is  Leon's  turn  to  submit  his entries to the
trashcan, and with me (CiH) to  play  Nick Hancock!! See what happens!
Also we will be getting selected other parties in on the act as well!!

Beats normal interviewing by far.. - CiH..
