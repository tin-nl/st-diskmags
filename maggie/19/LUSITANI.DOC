                       by Robert Ballard

(Big fancy hardcover book review..) Ha, it's CiH, in bookworm mode 
 once more, and you thought me totally uncultured as well!

'Exploring  the  Lusitania is the latest in a  series  of  rightly 
acclaimed books produced by the undersea explorer Bob Ballard..

Robert  Ballard was the discoverer of the final resting  place  of 
the Titanic,  back in the mid eighties..  Using a very deep diving 
minisub,  he managed to get close access to that tragic ship,  and 
using a remotely controlled robot probe, managed to take thousands 
of  photographs  of  the scene..  A very well  put  together  book 
followed, which contained these images, and a history of that ship 
including  the  sinking..  Also new to the book were several  very 
detailed  paintings  of  what the ship looked like  on  the  ocean 
bottom..  This  appealed to CiH who,  always looking to add to his 
store of knowledge and experiences put in a request with  parental 
GHQ for his birthday..  (This was about 1987, when the 'hot' demos 
were  the MIDI sound demos produced by Richard Karsmakers and  the 
early TEX Little Colour and Little Sound demos..  CiH got the book 
as planned, and pronounced it somewhat good..

A  couple  of  years later,  saw another book on the  sinking  and 
rediscovery  of  the  Bismarck,  a German battleship lost  in  the 
Atlantic,  and a bit later still,  another book of explorations of 
the  Guadacanal  Islands in the Pacific,  site of several  crucial 
battles and shipwrecks during the Second World War..

Bringing  the  story right up to date,  Bob Ballard's most  recent 
endeavours  take  in  the exploration of the  wreck  site  of  the 
Lusitania, a liner almost as famous as the Titanic in its day, and 
one to meet as equally a tragic fate..

The book,  in a superb feat of timing, managed to appear mere days 
before  my  latest birthday,  just like the Titanic  and  Bismarck 
books before it..  Therefore it is now available for review..

The Lusitania is different from the other two famous  shipwrecks.. 
She was sunk in coastal waters near the Irish coast, she went down 
in just 300 feet of water,  and the final position of the ship has 
been known for years.. So no time was needed to look for her.. The 
book  is  a  combination of little  known  technical  data,  human 
interest  with  accounts  from the survivors  of  the  sinking,  a 
detailed  record of what they found,  even a potted explanation of 
the naval strategy that led to the sinking,  and the aftermath and 
public enquiries that followed..

The  Lusitania was probably the most famous U-Boat victim  of  the 
First World War,  and incredible though it seems, the unsuspecting 
ship  practically  delivered  itself to  the  submarine  concerned 
through a tragic combination of events and possible human  error.. 

The ship was sunk by a single torpedo hit which in turn  detonated 
millions  of suspended coal dust particles (Lusitania was a  coal-
burning  ship)  which blew a much bigger hole in her side  than  a 
single torpedo could have otherwise managed.. The discovery of the 
precise  cause of the second explosion was only made when  Ballard 
explored  the  ship,  and  finally  laid to  rest  the  conspiracy 
theories surrounding the sinking (Lusitania was illegally carrying 
ammunition/was led into dangerous waters deliberately to allow the 
sinking  with  heavy  loss of life to  get  American  support  for 
Britain against Germany..)

Lusitania  sank very quickly for such a large ship,  just eighteen 
minutes, and 1195 passengers and crew died..

As  with  the  other  books,  there is a  wealth  of  photographic 
material,  both from the period,  and modern material taken at the 
wreck  site  itself..  There is a large section dedicated  to  the 
outcry  raised after the sinking,  and the emotionally  heightened 
propaganda  produced as a result of the sinking..  The British and 
allies  were,  not  unnaturally,  outraged,  as this was seen as a 
deliberate  atrocity  attack on civilians..  Something  like  this 
would  be  sadly  seen as mild and  unsurprising  now  in  certain 
contexts,  but  was brutally novel to a culture in the early years 
of  the  twentieth century,  based of notions of honour and  'fair 
play'..  

The  Germans considered Lusitania to be a legitimate naval  target 
though..  The  ship  was  built  for  possible  conversion  to  an 
auxiliary cruiser,  it could mount guns, although it was not armed 
at the time of sinking and was included in the naval lists of  the 
period..  The  ship was originally built with a government loan to 
Cunard, the owners, for the purpose of breaking the trans-Atlantic 
speed  record,  the  Blue Riband which was held by Germany in  the 
early 1900's..  The government wanted something in return,  so the 
auxilary cruiser option was included at construction. In fact, the 
sister  ship Maurentania was converted to a troopship during  WW1, 
and narrowly missed a torpedoing herself..

Some  of the best parts of the book near the end,  are the  hugely 
detailed   photos  and  montages  of  the  decaying  wreck,   with 
explanations how they related to the formerly intact liner.. There 
are  several  paintings  by a very  talented  marine  artist,  Ken 
Marschall,  both  of  the  wreck  as it would  look  now,  and  of 
different  parts  of the sinking as it happened..  His  work  also 
appeared in the earlier books,  and gives the books their distinct 
identity with the front cover illustrations done by him as well..

'Exploring  the Lusitania' is a richly warm herbal bath of  images 
that you immerse yourself into for a few hours,  and come out with 
your mental ligaments relaxed but feeling thoughtful at the  same 
time.. One to get for all you marine archeaology fans out there..
