(Disclaimer..  The resemblance of this story to any fictional work 
produced  by  a  certain  Mr  G.Orwell  is  rather  stunning   and 
intentional..-  CiH.) Bill Gates,  after years of being content in 
sitting back and raking in loads of cash from other peoples ideas, 
has  decided to write a book..  He has a 'vision' apparently,  The 
Way Ahead.. We see how it might turn out!!

                 ---------------V---------------

It was a cold bright clear day in April,  the system clocks struck 
thirteen..  Bugger! Winston Smith thought, with just a faint trace 
of  irritation,  another  floating point error,  as he strode  on. 
collar  turned up against the biting wind..  Entering the foyer of 
Intel  Mansions he headed for the stairs,  knowing full well  that 
the lift would be out of order.. Usually a virus in the works, but 
this  week,  the  power  had  been  cut in  an  economy  drive  in 
preparation  for  Infotainment Week..  The bitter tang  of  gently 
simmering co-processors mingled with the universal odour of boiled 
cabbage  and  month old software packaging..  A smell,  it seemed, 
that summed up the whole of London..

Inside  his  flat,  the  never-turned-off bulk of the  PC  InfoNet 
terminal  burbled  its  relentlessly  hearty  mixture  of  heavily 
overdressed  good  news and not so exciting trivial  facts..  This 
terminal  could never be turned completely off,  and indeed had  a 
two-way  ethernet  gateway  through which  the  authorities  could 
monitor  the  occupant of the flat..  No-one knew when  they  were 
being  watched,  so  it was safest to assume that you  were  being 
watched all the time,  and conduct your activities on the keyboard 
accordingly..

Winston Smith turned to an alcove beneath the field of gaze of the 
ever-active  PC  InfoNet  terminal,  it  housed one  of  his  most 
precious  possessions,  a  rather  grubby and ancient,  but  still 
serviceable  Sinclair Laptop..  Its dim amber screen winked at him 
as  he tapped quietly away,  it was a very old computer,  one that 
had  predated the takeover by Big Bill,  and discovered only in an 
old hobby shop in a forgotten part of the East End of London..  He 
should  not have been at the shop as it was called  'Trading  with 
Boxshifters' and heartily dissaproved of by the party.. He took it 
home,  knowing  mere possession itself was a subversive act,  even 
with  a  blank  memory card fitted,  and found it to be  a  fairly 
simple  machine,  not able to do too much,  but perfectly adequate 
for  the job of recording and keeping Winston's diary..  It always 
did  what it was asked to do,  and was not prone to the  fussiness 
and complexities of the login procedure of his InfoNet..  

Winston had decided to keep a diary, and was about to write in his 
first entry..

April  14th..  "Logged in to the 'SleazeNet' area last night,  and 
saw  a really great WinMovie..  it was about a load of people  who 
got  blown  up in a lifeboat,  there was a really great bit  where 
part  of an arm flew up into the screen..  Great bit of  SiliScape 
rendering  on  that,  there was lots of applause from the  company 
sponsored seats,  but there was one prole who kicked up, said that 
it oughtnt be shwon in front of the kids typical prole always want 
to start something...."

Then  Winston  stopped,  looked  back over the preceding  page  of 
childish  typing,  as he had rambled on,  gradually shedding basic 
rules  of  punctuation  until his thoughts had  coalesced  into  a 
pounding  blur  and his typing went to pot,  his head  hurt  too.. 
Winston  looked into the far corner of the room and saw the  half-
dozen  discarded  empty bottles of Victory  Grolsch,  the  obvious 
cause of his discomfort from last night.. Winston reached down for 
a larger bottle filled with a darker liquid,  the Victory Pernod.. 

He  poured himself a stiff measure,  and gulped it down in a split 
second..  he gasped and coughed as it hit his stomach wall, having 
the  effect  of a French and aniseed flavoured version  of  Nitric 
Acid..  After a second or two,  the acute heartburn went away, his 
stomach  subsided,  and  the world began to look a  more  cheerful 
place..

Just then, the PC InfoNet screen struck fourteen through tinny two 
inch  diameter  monitor side-mounted speakers,  Winston had to  go 
back to work for his second shift, and the daily hate..

As  Winston walked to the tube station,  he looked up and saw  the 
huge  pyramidal structures that dominated the London skyline..  To 
the  east,  he  could sight the pyramid housing his employer,  The 
Ministry of Truth,  once known as Future Publishing, to the north, 
was the really scary one, the Ministry of (Self)Love who were home 
to a particularly virulent part of the former Future  Publishing.. 

Their  mysterious  leader.  only known as 'The Edge' was  said  to 
kidnap  people  off  the streets,  trawl the  'Net  for  suspected 
dissidents,  retro-computing freaks, trainspotters, and other real 
or  imaginary thought criminals..  What he then did to them in the 
underground  cellars in the Ministry of (Self)Love was  not  fully 
known,  but  enough  horrible  rumours had leaked out  to  prevent 
anyone  not on offical business there,  coming within a couple  of 
kilometers of the place..  It was hard enough to get close anyway, 
as  gorilla-faced  sub-editors and reviewers  roamed  the  streets 
adjacent  to  the complex armed with overlarge rubber  batons  and 
worse..

Of  course,  the Ministry of Interactivity saw to the flow of  new 
ProleStation  games,  and the Ministry of Reptile Simulations kept 
all the meaningless young men in ponytails busy..

Strange  then,  Winston  thought,  that  London had always  stayed 
London,  when  the  country as a whole had changed its  name  from 
England, or Britain, to 'Captive Market One'..

                  --------------V--------------                    

Back at work, Winston ambled with his collegues in anticipation of 
the daily two-minute hate..  Suddenly a grinding noise very like a 
badly-adjusted  monitor speaker burst from the big  viewscreen  at 
the  end  of the office..  "Attention consumers,  attention..  The 
daily  hate  starts  now." The next thing that  appeared  was  the 
familiar figure of Sam Tramiel.. The content of the 'hates' varied 
daily,  but Tramiel was always central to them..  It was said that 
Sam  Tramiel was one of the early market leaders of  the  personal 
computer  revolution,  but he disagreed with Big Bill,  was forced 
out of business, but escaped to promulgate his brand of heresy..

It  was even said that a book written by him was  circulating  the 
prole  quarters,  the  'Falcon 030 Owners Manual'  was  officially 
denied  by  the authorities,  but strong rumours about it came  up 
constantly..  Was  there a massive conspiracy at work as Big  Bill 
always  said?  He  said that enternal vigilance was the  price  of 
total market share..

Winston looked at the screen as Tramiel spoke,  about his views on 
how computers could be sold without marketing or software, that it 
was right for a really well-specified computer to die of  neglect, 
and  the  crowd shrieked with rage..  One collegue behind  Winston 
could  be heard individually screaming "You useless bastard!"  The 
cries and outrage rose in fervour as the images on screen  speeded 
up..  Somewhere,  an .AVI player struggled to deliver the speed of 
changes to the screen..  Then it seemed that Tramiel was bleating, 
then a sheep's head morphed onto Tramiel's shoulders, so he became 
the sheep.. "Brilliant bit of morphing,!" the crowd yelled, before 
resuming  the  blood-curdling stuff..  Then suddenly,  a  bayonet-
wielding Amiga owner seemed to burst out of the screen,  the crowd 
shrank  back in fear,  but then the familiar features of Big  Bill 
himself  appeared,  as he murmured some words which seemed to calm 
the crowd.. 

Then Winston spotted her, Julia..

He  had often seen her around the communal areas of the  Ministry, 
wearing the bright raster-colour sash of the Anti-Hacking League.. 
She  apparently  worked in the multi-tedia  department,  who  were 
responsible for post-production of the infotainment releases  from 
Big  Bill himself..  Winston always felt uncomfortable around her, 
and  people like her..  Always with an expression of keenness  and 
thorough  dedication  to Big Bill and all his  works..  Nice  tits 
though,  but  try  asking  that one out?  No chance!  Winston  was 
therefore   very   surprised  when  Julia  came  up  to   him   to 
surreptitiously press a crumpled piece of paper into his hand..

Winston  secreted  the paper in his overall pocket,  he would  not 
look at it,  and its hidden possibilities until he was able to get 
a quiet moment away from the demands of his job..

                -----------------V----------------
 
Winston  turned  to  his desk,  with the  omnipresent  InfoNet  PC 
terminal sitting in a top-heavy fashion on it.. 

"Minter  no go anymore,  all references to him in party literature 
erased..   Please   crossref  new  author  with  fifth   Symposium 
Convention.. Ideas please?"

Was the first thing bursting out of the screen..

Winston picked up a pencil,  and sucked thoughtfully, the end soon 
soggy  from  earlier sessions of forced mastication of  the  blunt 
end  when Winston was looking for inspiration..  He picked up  the 
dictaphone, and spoke quietly into it..     

"Get  me the fifth Symposium reports and competition results  ASAP 
please.."

And sure enough, the requested info in a nice tight .ZIP file came 
thudding through the serial port onto his desktop..  Some fiddling 
about  with arcane and little known,  but still used DOS  commands 
later, brought the information into a viewable format..

Winston  glanced  through  the  Symposium  report,   already,  the 
references  to  Minter  had  been  removed,  his  key  speech  and 
prizewinning  routines  had been surgically  taken  out..  Winston 
remembered  the  document  and  accompanying  screenshot  in   its 
original form, but how long before this altered version became the 
'official'   version,   and  his  own  memory  was  condemned   as 
unreliable, not to mention politically suspect?

Winston  had  to  'fill in the gaps' left by  the  censor's  crow-
barring  of Minter out of the record..  To do this,  he decided to 
create  an  artificial  character,  of  a  semi-heroic  status.  A 
smallish  talent  who would have been noticed  at  Symposium,  and 
forgotten  for ever after..  Warming to his task,  he decided on a 
pseudonym  first,  ShitHead  3..  The rest usually followed easily 
from there..  Kev Tempsey, an artist who gained notoriorty as part 
of  the infamous Reservoir Dogs team..  He drew his first  picture 
aged  six years and nine months..  When he was in the youth  anti-
hacking  league,  he composed a module that killed nineteen  enemy 
prisoners  of war when the volume was turned up really  loud..  He 
went on to be part of the Reservoir Dogs team, shortly before they 
were swept away in the great Z-Buffer purges the Autumn after..

Winston  wound up the new case-history and sent back  the  amended 
file to central records..  A good morning's work,  cetainly better 
than hacking a miserable living as an unlicensed diskzine  scriver 
in the dingier areas of the Prole quarters.. He went to lunch..

                 ---------------V-------------

And  with  Winston tucking into his favourite prawn  cocktail  and 
platitude sauce sandwiches,  we break the story for this episode.. 
Oh,  why  won't  CiH  ever finish a story in  one  episode??  Will 
Winston  get anywhere with Julia,  do they bite off more than they 
both can chew?? Will the 'Edge' have words with them?/ Just who is 
Griff of the Inner Circle??  Will Big Bill suffice?? Find out next 
time!!
