
*** INTERVIEW WITH THE TOP HOLLYWOOD ACTOR, TOMMY LEE JONES ***

Yes, this is the first ever time in the history of Maggie (or
indeed any disk magazine) that we have been able to give an
interview with a major movie star.  You will notice that this
is in a different format to standard interviews, but don't let
that spoil your enjoyment of this article!

At the time of writing, TLJ (as he is known) has been involved 
with the movie-releases of Batman Forever and Cobb, which should
be available from your nearest moviestore on videotape and
laserdisc.

Interviewer: Bob McAdorey (Transcribed by Leslie Brown)

McAdorey: Still to come on Entertainment Profile, a profile of Barry
          Levinson, the director behind this week's no. 1 box office
          hit, Disclosure. Plus Oscar whisperings for Tommy Lee Jones
          in his newest movie, "Cobb."

(Film clip from "Cobb," scene from flashback on baseball diamond as
Cobb comes up to the plate while taunting the umpire and the catcher,
giving the catcher a woman's slip, telling him that his wife had left
it in his automobile the night before.)

McAdorey: Okay, other screen notes now. This guy made his movie debut
          in "Love Story back" in 1970. He played uh, one of Ryan
          O'Neal's Harvard roommates. His career moved on steadily
          but it wasn't until "The Fugitive" that Tommy Lee Jones
          became what studios call "bankable." Today most filmmakers
          know that casting Jones ensures at least one thing: a
          formidable performance. I met with the actor in New York
          recently where he was promoting his latest movie: "Cobb."

(Film clip from "The Client," scene in children's court as the
Reverend Roy Foltrigg argues that the child ought to be made to
reveal what he knows about the suicide he has witnessed. "What wanton
hubris is this? Speak child now. Lying lips are an abomination to the
Lord. So sayeth the Psalm.")

(Another film clip from "Under Siege," confrontational scene where
Strannix says how tired he was coming up with solutions for other
people's messes.)

(Yet another film clip from "Heaven and Earth," as Steve Butler puts
his family on the chopper to air-evac them out of a hot zone to
safety.)

(And, another clip from "Blown Away," Gaerity, on the phone to
McGivney,explaining how he's come "to create a new country here for
you called `Chaos' and a new government called `Anarchy.'")

McAdorey (off camera): How do you do what you do? I've never seen you
          perform at anything less than perfectly. How do you
          prepare? How do you get into that character? Is there a
          method? Is there an attitude that you...

Jones:    Well, uh, that's a nice question, but, er, couched in
          compliment, I appreciate it. Um, the, uh, answer is, um...
          Well there are two answers. The short one is, I don't know
          and the long one just goes on and on and on...

(Both McAdorey and Jones laugh.)

McAdorey (voice-over): Getting a smile from this eight-generation
          Texan isn't easy. He eats journalists for breakfast. But
          listening to the Harvard-grad's thoughts on acting is
          always a treat.

Jones:    There's not a real, um, American method but this is a
          melting pot after all and, um, people come to the American
          motion picture business, into the Canadian motion picture
          business, from all walks of life, all manner of background.
          You'll find people who were raised in the theater working
          with people whose history of performance is pretty much
          limited to stand up comedy and they both wind up being
          good motion picture actors.

(A behind-the-scenes clip from "Cobb" is shown. Director Ron Shelton
sets up a scene in the casino as Cobb is about to clip one of the
tables.)

Jones (voiceover): It's a new world and, um, all directors are
          different, all actors are, are different and, um, if you
          want to, I think if you want to keep working you have to
          be adaptable. You have to know a lot about, uh, more than
          one method.

(Film clip from "The Fugitive." Gerard telling the troops about
Kimble at the scene of the train wreck... the "Listen up" scene.)

(Clip from the 1994 Academy Awards. A bald Tommy Lee Jones accepts
his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in "The
Fugitive." TLJ: "The only thing a man can say at a time like this: I
am not really bald.")

McAdorey (voice-over): Jones was already in his Cobb get-up at this
          year's Academy Awards where he won an Oscar for his work in
          "The Fugitive." In fact 1994 has been a very good year for
          the 48-year-old who has appeared in no less than 5 movies.

(Voice-over continues as film clips from "Natural Born Killers" and
"Blue Sky" are shown. Dwight and Scagnetti walking through the prison
on their way to Mallory's room, plotting to do away with both Mickey
and Mallory from "NBK" and Carly and Hank struggle to bring things
under control in a fabric store scene from "Blue Sky.")

          From "Natural Born Killers" to "Blue Sky."

(Voice-over continues with various clips from "Cobb." The dinner at
the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown; Cobb and Al Stump in the
car talking; and Cobb on a rampage in the hotel when none of his
"friends" would open their doors to him. "I invented the game of
baseball! Open up the door!")

          The word on "Cobb" has Jones being pegged for yet another
          nomination.

McAdorey: What is your relation with baseball? Did you play ball?
          Did you like it?

Jones:    Very little. I, I, played some, uh, little league, uh,
          then I played a little bit at prep school and that was
          about it. I wasn't a very good baseball player.

McAdorey and Jones (voice-over continues as behind-the-scenes clip
from "Cobb" is shown. Cobb at the plate, talking to crew members,
and setting up his mark, preparing for the next shot.)

McAdorey (voice-over): What about your attitude toward the game?

Jones (voice-over): Oh, I, uh, love the game. I like to see people
          play. I have very good feelings about the hours I've
          spent on baseball diamonds and, um, but I, really I was
          raised in a society...

(Clip over and camera back on Jones in studio.)

          where boys played football and then worried about the
          rest of the world later.

(Two clips from finished film, "Cobb." Flashback of Cobb coming out
of the dugout, swinging three bats as weights to loosen up. Cobb with
the cigarette girl as he rattles off his list of baseball records and
stats and tells her to take off her clothes.)

McAdorey: I'm going back to see that again. That movie is just so
          good. Jones' fans will soon see the actor's villainous
          side in the upcoming Batman installment, "Batman Forever."
          In the meantime we'll have more on the movie "Cobb" when
          it opens in theaters next week.

McAdorey: And even more movie news. (clears throat) This guy was
          the first man elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame. But
          Ty Cobb had qualities beyond his remarkable athletic
          ability, many of them repulsive, according to actor Tommy
          Lee Jones. And yet the Oscar-winner had no qualms about
          teaming with director Ron Shelton to bring this highly
          complex and controversial character to the big screen.

(Various film clips from "Cobb." Cobb explains to Stump: "My entire
life I have been misunderstood." Cobb's voice-over continues as a
scene of Cobb brawling with spectators is shown. Cobb: "You are the
very fortunate young sportswriter who has been chosen to tell the
true story... of Ty Cobb." Behind-the-scenes clip on location in
Rickwood Field, Alabama with Ron Shelton taking a bat and showing
Jones a particular stance at the plate.)

McAdorey (voice-over): Although he was nominated for an Oscar for
          another baseball film, "Bull Durham," writer/director Ron
          Shelton says there were larger questions that drew him
          into this story.

Shelton (on camera): Where do these kind of dark souls who are
          brilliant in a certain way come from? (laughs) How can
          you make beautiful music, then go off and beat somebody
          up? Uh, and, the other question: why do we turn these
          people, these celebrities into heroes, into role-models,
          into things that they, have nothing to do with their craft?

(Various more film clips from "Cobb." Again on the baseball diamond,
in the past. Still photos from newsreels and newspapers. Stump and
Cobb in a car as Stump argues that Cobb cannot dismiss Babe Ruth in
his memoirs. "Aren't you going to give Ruth credit for anything?"
Cobb speaks into his tape recorder microphone: "He ran okay for a fat
man." One more clip of Cobb sliding into home plate, spikes up, as
was his trademark. And the ensuing free-for-all which empties both
benches.)

McAdorey: Ty Cobb. Any second-thoughts, any trepidation about
          playing the world's biggest prick?

Jones:    (surprised) No. Not at all.

McAdorey (off camera): Then why do we like monsters like that?

Jones:    I don't know why we do. We, we, I sup-, we're fascinated, I
          suppose. Um, is he entirely a monster, or, could you, you
          know, could you say that he is entirely a monster? And is
          there a part of him that is not a monster? And is that part
          of him that's not a monster, ah, admirable in any way.

(Various film clips from "Cobb." The testimonial dinner at Coopers-
town. Car scene with Stump and Cobb: "You have never been this close
to greatness in your short life, son." Cobb again in the hotel room
hall, pounding on the doors of his "friends" to open on and let him
in. Cobb, saddened by the fact that his daughter refuses to see him
and even lies that she isn't his daughter to Stump. Stump and Cobb
arguing over the book to be written: "If you die before this book is
finished, I'll write the story I want." "Ain't gonna die before the
story is finished." "I'll write slow." "I'll die slow." Scene in
which Cobb, furious at the pages Stump has written thus far, throws a
bottle at wall, screaming and waking Stump up.)

McAdorey (voice-over last clip): Robert Wuhl, who plays sportswriter
          Al Stump, agrees with Jones' view that Cobb was no one-
          dimensional player.

Wuhl (on camera): It's not just as simple as being a real monster
          and saying he was an awful person. He also he-, he also
          supported indigent ballplayers, he left all, he was an
          incredible business man. I mean, he was a mul-, first
          multi-millionaire, had stock in the ground-floor of Coca-
          Cola, General Motors, Fisher Body.

(Voice-over continues as more clips of "Cobb" are shown. Cobb at the
plate. Letting a ball go. And revelling in the fact that the pitcher
didn't catch him on a bad pitch.)

Wuhl (voice-over): He was the first guy to lead players' strikes,
          you know, which is, ah, it's very interesting. First guy
          to do celebrity endorsements to make money off his name.
          Ah, um, first guy to be in mov-, first sports figure to
          be in movies. I mean, it's fascinating.

Wuhl (on camera): At the same time, he was a wife-beater, he was a
          notorious bigot and a racist. Uh, so it's not that simple
          and of course in  Hollywood, everything's gotta be black
          and white. And this is not that. This, this movie is not
          a black and white picture, nor is it a baseball movie,
          really, I must, I think we have to get that across. It's
          a character study.

(More clips from "Cobb." Crowd booing a young Cobb as he heads to the
plate. Cobb, smiling, waving, enjoying every second of it. A much
older Cobb, who is closer to end, in his family's tomb in a cemetery
in his boyhood home town, tells Stump: "Children of America need
heroes, Stumpy. You know that." Another clip shows Cobb giving money
to a down-and-out former star of the game for his testimonial at
Cooperstown.)

McAdorey (voice-over last clip): Character study? Yes, but also a
          snapshot of the beginnings of the cult of celebrity.

McAdorey: We see heroes like Wayne Gretsky or Bobby Orr or Dave
          Winfield. Nice guys but nobody will ever make a movie
          about them.

Shelton:  Yeah and how much do we not know about them too. And,
          and I mean, I don't care if they're nice guys. I'm just
          saying, uh... I, yeah, I don't know. Bruce Woodnall was a
          nice guy too. He's going to jail.

McAdorey: Okay, not everyone is happy with this movie, including
          some of Cobb's relatives. Uh, his son, Jim Cobb, feels
          the portrayal is untrue and unfair. Watch.

(Clip from behind-the-scenes of "Cobb" with pitcher throwing ball at
Cobb at the plate.)

Jim Cobb (voice-over): Not true. Character assassination.

Jim Cobb (on camera): And it's very upsetting to our family. Our
          number two daughter (voice cracks with emotion) went and
          saw the movie down in, ah, Los Angeles and my daughter
          cried all the way through.

(Another clip of Cobb carrying and swinging three baseball bats to
loosen up as he heads for the plate.)

McAdorey (voice-over): Jim Cobb says the film starring Tommy Lee
          Jones misses much of the real story and he has plenty of
          newspaper clippings to prove it.

(Clips showing Jim Cobb paging through scrap book filled with
newspaper clipping of his father, Ty Cobb; various baseball cards of
Cobb and a photo of Cobb with Babe Ruth and another ball player.
Final shot of Cobb's tomb and his memorial.)

McAdorey (voice-over continues): He blames the film's research staff
          for failing to contact him or anyone who knew his father
          in his early years. The movie's based on a book written
          by award-winning sports journalist, Al Stump, who met Ty
          Cobb after he was retired.

McAdorey (on camera): That's it for the world of show biz. More
          celebrity news on Entertainment Tonight at 7:30.

(Wide shot of McAdorey with co-anchors of the news.)

McAdorey: I feel sorry for Jim Cobb, the son. But I still believe
          Al Stump because Jim goes by newspaper clippings and as
          you know in those days they protected players. They didn't
          bad-mouth the Georgia Peach. They didn't bad-mouth Babe
          Ruth. The media didn't start doing that until recently,
          going after athletes and politicians.

Male anchor: And ah. Yeah. This, this movie though, you, you have
          touted as one of the best you've seen this year.

McAdorey: Yeah! I would think so. Uh-hum.

Female anchor: Tommy Lee Jones is so great.

McAdorey: Great in everything he does. (Echoed by female anchor.)
          In  anything he does. Of course the movie starts off
          with a car chase and it's kinda dumb that way. And there
          are some weak parts in it. I'm not sure Robert Wuhl is
          the guy to play Al Stump but, uh, but Cobb! My God, what
          a story, what an incredible monster, I think I called him.

Thanks, Leslie, for a great transcript!
