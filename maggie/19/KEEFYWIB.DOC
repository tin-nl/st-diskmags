diskmag,  and  currently  editing  the 'Warp' Trekmag  has  kindly 
agreed to step in.. - CiH.. 

                        KEEFYS WIBBLE : 19/10/95
                        ========================

        From the depths of the Victor Meldrew Appreciation Society
        ==========================================================

Well, I hope you're all comfortable, because I'm in the mood to wibble 
on for ages.  Those of you that have seen similar columns I have written 
for other disk-mags will know that basically all I do is natter on about 
anything that comes into my head as I type.  No doubt you're all falling 
asleep already.

 You may not be aware of this, but this is actually the second 'Keefys 
Wibble' that I've done for this issue of Maggie.  What happened to the 
first I have no idea.  But somehow or other the Post Office decided to 
lose it, probably never to be seen again.  It's a bit annoying really as 
there was about 70k's worth of Maggie stuff on the disk.  Another 
annoying thing about it is that I told Tony Greenwood I had done the 
stuff, so naturally he mentioned to Chris that I had done it.  Needless 
to say, I expect Chris and Tony thought I was lying when the stuff never 
arrived at the illustrious offices at Maggie headquarters.  I know I 
would have thought the same.  

 I just want to know what the hell is happening to the postal service in 
this country.  I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems to me as 
if they've got this thing about losing little brown jiffy bags.  No end 
of times I've sent stuff out, only for it to never reach it's 
destination.  Tony Greenwood can vouch for this.  When Tony and I used 
to run Stosser, we were always having to ring each other to check that 
various bits and bobs had made it to the other end.  Eventually we had 
to resort to sending important articles etc.. via recorded delivery.  
Not cheap I can assure you.

 Postal problems also played quite a big part in my decision to give up 
Keefy PDS.  No end of times I would recieve letters from irate customers 
asking where their disks were.  Of course when I explained that I had 
definately sent the disks, and that they must have got lost in the post, 
it was very rarely believed.  It's also played havoc with contacts, 
there are a fair few of them that I haven't heard from in ages.  So if 
you are a contact of mine, and are wondering where I am, if you still 
want to stay in touch, drop me a line.

Also, I have not had a reply yet from any of the P.D. Libraries that I 
sent issue 3 of Warp to.  Those of you who I normally send it to will 
know  who you are, so if you didn't recieve it get in touch.  

 Anyway, the situation with the mail has gotten so bad, that I've 
decided that i'm going to get myself a modem, at least then I know that 
my letters etc.. will get through, and if they don't I can know pretty 
quickly and rectify it.  I was actually going to get myself one a couple 
of months ago, but finances wouldn't allow it.  I was also going to get 
one some time this week, however, just recently I finally decided to 
attend my first ever Star Trek convention.  I'd kept a nice tidy sum in 
the bank for the modem, so that I could get it when I got back from the 
convention.  That soon went out of the window though as I spent a 
fortune whilst I was there.  

For a start off, the pints were #1.90 each, then what with grub and all 
the t-shirts and stuff that I bought, I had practically nothing left 
when I got back.  So, for now, it looks as though the modem will have to 
take a back seat, and I'll have to put up with jiffy bags going walkies 
every now and again.

On a completely different note now, Maggie 18 was yet another cracking 
issue, and it was nice to see that Chris and the chaps haven't gone for 
an exclusively Falcon compatable shell, i.e. they now have one for the 
St owners and one for the Falcon owners.  I don't know whether there is 
any difference in terms of article content or anything, but two seperate 
shells is a good idea.  

I would love to have a Falcon compatable shell for Warp, but because it's
written in Stos it's unlikely it will ever happen.  Unless of course, a 
good hearted Falcon owner can offer his assistance and do one for me.  I 
can't offer payment, as Warp is freeware.  But you would have my eternal
gratitude. If you are interested in doing a shell for me, my address is:

        57 Hearsall Lane, Earlsdon, Coventry, CV5 6HF


Many of you may have noticed (if you have seen Warp) that I have a 
tendency to moan a bit about this that and the other.  I'm afraid thats 
just me, many people will tell you that I am an expert in the art of 
moaning.  Given the chance I will grumble about anything and everything.  
As you can see, this article is no exception.  I've already moaned about 
the post office, and by the time I've finished I'll probably upset a few 
other people as well.    

This moan is on the subject of religion, the Sunday just gone, I was woken 
up at 8 in the morning by a smiling band of Jehovah's witnesses.  Now I 
don't know about most of you, but on a Sunday I like to relax, and 
usually I don't move from my pit till about 10 or 11.  Needless to say I 
was extremely annoyed with these people and told them to get lost.

I've got no problem with people having religious beliefs, but when they 
come round knocking on my door trying to convert me, or stopping me in the 
middle of the street I get extremely annoyed.  If I wanted to be converted 
I'd go to a church or Mosque or whatever.  Personally, I think this kind 
of door to door calling should be banned. 

I have no time for religion whatsoever, I happen to believe that if there 
was a god up there, then he must be an extremely malicious and evil 
individual.  In recent years I have seen the deaths of people I care 
deeply about, I've also watched as innocent children suffer in distant 
countries.  I'd like to know what they've done to upset 'god'.  Christians 
justify these deaths and the suffering by saying that 'god must have a 
reason.  Pretty sick reason if you ask me.

*lower case g's are deliberate by the way*  

There is no higher being that controls our destiny, the only people who 
will dictate what will happen to mankind, is mankind itself.  The way we 
are going there probably won't be much of a future for man, but it will be 
all our own work.

I'm also a firm believer that somewhere out there, in space, there are 
multitudes of alien races waiting to be encountered.  Although I doubt 
that they have visited us yet (we're not that important).  I reckon that 
in the next fifty years or so we will have our first official encounter 
with an alien race.  I at least hope it's within my lifetime.  Let's face 
it, there are literally millions upon millions of galaxies out there, just 
like ours.  Each galaxy contains millions and millions of stars, just like 
ours.  I expect that orbiting those millions of stars, are millions of 
planets.  And somewhere out there, there have to be millions of other 
lifeforms.  Earth cannot possibly be the only planet in the universe with 
life on it.  To assume that to be the case would be arrogant.

Why is it then, that people who believe in aliens and such like are 
usually classed as nutters.  Okay, so I admit, there are a few barn-pots 
out there who spoil it for the rest of us.  But how come people who 
believe in one all powerful super-natural being are not treated in the 
same way?.  It's just as fantastic a theory.

Hmm, I think thats enough of that for now, no doubt those of you with 
strict religious beliefs will want to assasinate me or something.  Just 
remember, this is only my point of view.  I'm not mocking your beliefs, 
just stating my own.

Well, I bet you were never expecting that when you first loaded up this 
document were you?.  Not a great deal of computer related stuff in it at 
all really.  

The next subject is something very close to my heart, and thats footy, or 
football, or soccer if you prefer to use the American term.  

Yesterday, were the European matches, and for some reason, in my area they 
were showing the Juventus v Rangers game.  I could have sworn they were 
going to show the Blackburn one.  Must have changed their mind at the last 
minute.  In the end I was glad that they did show the Rangers match, 
because it was quite a good match.  Although when I say match, I should 
have said mis-match.  Juventus were all over them, and with a little more 
luck could have gone in at the break 10 up.  It was obvious very early on 
that Rangers were going to have trouble keeping the scoreline down.  

A bit of a shame really, because it looks like Rangers are out now, it 
will be very difficult for them to recover from this defeat and qualify, 
and on past European performances I doubt they will do it.  i'm not sure 
that Gascoigne would have been able to help them much either.

Blackburn didn't fare too well either, and it looks like they are in for 
an early exit too.  They've looked pretty dire in every game I've seen 
them play in so far, and to be honest, I think they will be lucky to 
finish in the top ten of the league this season.  Unless of course, they 
decide to buy in some new talent, which I expect they will do if things 
don't start going right soon.  Bohinen looks like he will be a good buy, 
and for once Blackburn didn't pay out a fortune for the player.

Now for my team, Coventry.  Things aren't looking too good for us at the 
moment either.  Only one win since the beginning of the season, and that 
was against Manchester City.  With the players we've got I can't believe 
we will go down, especially with Big Ron as the gaffer.  Still, at least 
if we do get the drop, we will have the satisfaction of getting further 
than 1 round in the Coca Cola or Littlewoods cup or whatever it is now.  
Normally we get knocked out by these lower teams.  I think City would much 
rather play the bigger clubs than the little ones in these competitions.  

Now onto another moan, and this time the daggers are aimed at the T.V. 
companies.  What is it with the people that run these things.  Do they 
honestly think that all we ever want to watch are soaps, soaps and more 
soaps?.  It seems to me that if there isn't some sort of soap on now, its 
the news, or if its in the morning it's one of those daft morning T.V. 
programmes.  You know the ones, the ones where all they do is talk about 
fashion and what these people from hollywood you've never heard of are 
doing.  Then you get these naff cooking sections and to round it all off, 
you get agony aunt sections where people can air their problems to the 
world and have them solved.  What a load of rubbish.

Now I'm unemployed, and the last thing I want to see during the day are 
these types of programs.  They are obviously aimed at women, so what about 
all these un-employed chaps that are out there?.  What do we get to see?. 
We've got a simple choice, we either watch these, or a black and white 
film from the 1930's or something, or kids educational stuff.  Not much of 
a choice is it?.  

And the soaps, why so many of them ?.  Practically every station has about 
ten of them a week of some kind or other.  I can't stand these things, 
surely there must be better stuff out there that they can put on instead?. 
And now, they're repeating the episodes of them during the day as well.  
Now I don't know about the rest of you, but i'm sure that when Sky first 
came along, the normal T.V. stations said that Sky repeated stuff too 
much.  Now both the ITV and BBC are doing exactly the same, ARRRGGHH!!.

So what sort of television would I like to see, obviously I like Star 
Trek, but I think there's plenty of that on T.V. at the moment, what with 
TNG on Wednesday, DS9 on Thursday, and the Original Series on Sunday.  
You've also got it on every day on Sky and now Voyager has started at 
the weekend.  I wouldn't mind it more often, but that would probably 
drive the rest of you mad.  

I'd like to see more decent original comedy as well.  I find it hard 
to think of a program about at the moment that I find genuinely funny.  
They say that they are making a new series of Red Dwarf, well I hope so, 
because that is the best comedy I've seen in years.  How about a new 
series of Black Adder, or better still, lets have some new comedy instead 
of these naff sit-coms that bore me to death.  

Films, there have been a few decent films on recently, particularly on ITV, 
but I won't watch films on ITV because 1. They put adverts in them, this 
is only mildly irritating, and I can put up with this.  and 2. They stick 
the friggin news smack bang in the middle of it.  Whose stupid idea was it 
to do that?.  There's nothing worse when you're just getting into a film 
to have a message come up saying 'and this film will continue after the 
news from ITN'.  I don't know about you, but if that happened while I was 
watching a film, I'd turn over, and probably wouldn't turn back.  The
3rd, and probably most irritating thing about when the terrestrial 
stations show films, is the dubbing over of the swearing.  There's nothing 
worse than having swearwords dubbed over by actors voices who sound 
nothing like the actor playing the part, and usually the dubbed speecc is
so in-appropiate to what is going on that it's almost laughable.  I don't 
know whether any of you saw Heartbreak Ridge when it was shown on ITV 
earlier this year, but as you may well know the original film is littered 
with swearwords.  ITV practically deleted every swearword and replaced it 
with completely stupid alternatives.  They replaced 'Mother Fucker' with 
'Maggot farmer'.  This film was on late at night, yet they still chose to 
do this, why?.  Do they think that all us adults in the country are 
complete thicko's or something?.  We know there were swearwords in there, 
and the pathetic attempts they made at dubbing just made the film look 
cheap and stupid.  So I'll admit, they might have been kids watching, but 
is it right that the rest of us should have to put up with the crap, just 
because a few irresponsible parents can't exercise control over the T.V. 
their children watch.  I don't think it's fair.  If there is something on 
in our house that I don't think the kids should watch, then I either send 
them out of the room, or if it's late, send them to bed.  Easy isn't it.

Hmm, I've been moaning again haven't I?, I just knew that I would.  Maybe 
I should wibble about something else for a little while now.  Trouble is, 
I can't think of anything to talk about now.  

I bet you thought you were going to get rid of me then didn't you?.  Ah 
well, you're not that lucky.  I'll wibble about the ST scene for a bit 
now.  Loads of people have been be-moaning what could be the death of the 
ST coming to a monitor near you soon.  Personally I think the scene is in 
excellent shape.  So okay, your big developers have all jumped ship and 
gone to the P.C and the consoles.  But there is still some cracking stuff 
coming out.  Especially from those chaps at Unique Developements.  
Obsession et al are excellent.  It's about time that we saw some STe 
games.  After all the machine has been around for ages.  What a shame the 
big software houses didn't try anything.

I'm not all that sure about Top Byte's Super Stario Land though, as a game 
it wears thin very quickly.   Thankfully, I didn't buy a copy of the game, 
I had a go of it on a friends machine.  I can tell you that he's feeling a
little silly at having paid all that money for it.  Actually, on a 
slightly different note, but still on the subject of the game.  I think 
they would be best advised to recall all copies of the game and completely
re-design all the graphics for it, changing the name wouldn't be a bad 
idea either.  I have been told that much of the graphics have already been
changed, but I don't think it will be enough if Nintendo somehow get to 
see the game.  It is so blatently obviously copying the Mario games, that 
the big boys will probably find it hard to ignore, and believe me these 
big wigs have eyes everywhere.

Anyone else out there think this ruddy national lottery is a con?.  I've 
done it every week and still haven't even won even a tenner yet.  
Practically everyone else I know has except me.  I keep saying to the 
missus, "If we don't get at least a tenner this week, we'll stop doing 
it and I'll put the quid on something that is more likely to yeild some 
kind of return, like the gee-gees or something".  In the end though, I 
always end up getting the ticket, we've had the same numbers for ages, 
and you can guarantee that the week I stop doing it will be the week 
that the numbers turn up.  

Another annoying thing about the lottery is where all this money is 
going for the so-called good causes.  Now I'm not naive enough to think 
that giving my money to the lottery is a way of donating to charity, not 
by any means.  I play the lottery because I'm a greedy get and I want to 
win a million.   But these good causes so far, are a bit of a joke.  
Ruddy theatres and opera houses and stuff, and then you've got some 
ramblers association that gets something like 60 million.  Well, at 
least we know where the priorities lie now.  Sod cancer research, hell 
we'll have a brand new refurbished theatre, that'll do much more good.  
Mind you, we'll still charge a fortune so that the oiks can't get in.

I think there is a new lot of grants and stuff coming up in the next 
week or so, but I bet the medical charities don't get half as much as 
was thrown at the elitist projects last time round.

Well, it would seem that I have reached the end of this wibble.  Maybe 
I'll have another good long moan and whinge in another issue of Maggie, 
who knows?.
