
    MEREDITH SALENGER - The Return of a Truly Talented Actress!

Yes, it has certainly been a while ... the last time she appeared 
in  an  issue of Maggie was back in Issue  12,  alongside  Joanna 
Pacula and others who featured there.

As  far  as Meredith goes,  there has been one hell  of  activity 
centred  around her,  particularly on the  Internet,  where  news 
about  her new movies and what she has been doing since 'Edge  of 
Honor' has come in thick and fast over the last few months or so!

The  first  real  thing we heard from  Meredith  was  when  River 
Phoenix died back in October 1993 - two years later the film they 
both  starred  in,  A Night in the life  of  Jimmy  Reardon,  was 
screened here in the UK.  It was on rather late ... did you get a 
chance to see it?   More recently, however, was the news that she 
had bumped into her co-star from 'Edge of Honor' - Scott Reeves - 
who  was  on a visiting tour with other cast from his  soap  'The 
Young and The Restless' (which Meredith has also had a part in at 
some  time) at the famous Harvard Business  School/University  in 
Massachusetts!   Apparently  Meredith had been studying a  course 
there - quite which one I don't yet know at the time of writing - 
which she also graduated from.

Meredith's long absence from the movie screen was not all her own 
doing, however.  We had heard that she was involved in production 
of a movie in 1993 which never got finished ...  also she  didn't 
get  paid either for the role she took,  so I think this and  the 
legal action I imagine would have taken some time to sort out.

However,  we  are pleased to be able to review the following  new 
movies starring Meredith, these are April Morning, Village of the 
Damned and Legacy of Sin.

APRIL MORNING

This movie, starring Tommy Lee Jones (Under Siege), Robert Urich, 
Chad Lowe, Susan 'Dream A Little Dream' Blakely together with the 
interesting  re-appearance of Nicholas 'The Kiss'  Kilbertus,  is 
based on the true story of how the American locals fought against 
the might of the one-time strong British Army.   The movie starts 
with one of the locals, Solomon, being accosted by members of the 
Army, after they had found powder and shot in his wagon.  Shortly 
after this event, the injured Solomon came back to the home town, 
whereupon  Tommy Lee Jones,  Robert Urich and Nicholas  Kilbertus 
appear on-screen.   A meeting of the locals is called  for,  with 
Nicholas addressing the congregation at the local  church,  along 
with well-meaning humour on the way.

It  is  decided  at the  meeting  that,  following  the  incident 
involving  Solomon as well as others they had  heard  about,  the 
local men (around 79 of them) would stand up against the  British 
Army.

The  79 men also included boys over 15,  and this is  where  Chad 
Lowe comes in.  Finding his first feelings of love with his girl, 
played  by  Meredith Salenger,  he is catapulted from  this  into 
signing  the  agreement  in the muster  book,  then  standing  up 
against the British Army.

The  British Army then turn up on the green to face  the  locals.  
After a bloody massacre of the locals by them, the locals managed 
to  re-group close in a nearby field,  whereupon they managed  to 
shoot at and kill most of the remaining members of the army.

Unfortunately, the movie is not without casualties on both sides.  
Tommy  Lee  Jones'  character is shot,  the same  goes  for  many 
others.  Only  the character played by Robert  Urich  (Meredith's 
father in the film) together with Chad Lowe and some others  from 
the village survive.

Generally,  April Morning is a good film,  with a splendid  cast.  
To date,  it has never been released on video - but this has  now 
changed  in the US,  from the end of November '95.   Hopefully  a 
release in Europe will follow soon!

VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED

Directed by the legendary director,  John Carpenter,  Village  of 
the Damned is a remake of the original 1960's British movie,  the 
screenplay  of  which was put together by a guy  called  Stirling 
Silliphant.  Carpenter's version contains some differences to the 
original story,  ie, the action has moved from England to the US, 
to  a fictional town called Midwich,  with a population of  6,000 
people or more.

A  strong  cast which includes former Superman  star  Christopher 
Reeve  (before  he was injured in  his  recent  accident),  Linda 
Kowzlowski  (Crocodile  Dundee),   Kirstie  Alley,  Peter  Jason, 
Michael  Pare  and  Meredith Salenger give  their  all  in  their 
respective  performances  which make this movie one of  the  best 
horror movies of all time.

The residents of Midwich are going about their usual business ... 
the  doctor  (Christopher Reeve) makes a trip out of town  for  a 
couple of hours or so, other people make deliveries to and around 
the Midwich area.

In Midwich itself, a summer fete is being set up, together with a 
barbecue and stalls of various kinds.   Suddenly,  a dark  shadow 
envelopes the whole town,  putting all of the residents to  sleep 
whatever they are doing.   Road accidents also occur here as  the 
drivers  of the vehicles are also affected by  the  shadow.   The 
authorities  outside Midwich think that it is attributal to  some 
kind of chemical gas leak at some power station,  but this is not 
the case.

The  shadow sits on Midwich for around six hours,  from  10am  to 
4pm.   When  it finally lifts,  everyone gets up - with  blinding 
headaches  -  and,  if  they happened  to  be  women,  they  were 
mysteriously pregnant,  but none of them knew that at this stage.  
Gradually,  however,  each of the women think that they might  be 
pregnant  due to the fact that they were suffering  from  morning 
sickness etc,  - however, the poignant performance here was given 
by  Melanie  Roberts  (Meredith Salenger)  -  the  character  was 
pregnant  but  was  ALSO  a  virgin.   As  you  can  imagine,  an 
unplanned,  unexpected pregnancy can be a nasty thing to occur to 
any  woman,  especially given the circumstances.   The women  all 
receive  their diagnoses from the doctor that they are  pregnant, 
each  one taking the news in different ways.   For  some  reason, 
however, they all decide to keep their babies.

The movie then forwards on to the birth of the cursed babies, the 
infamous 'Children of the Damned' that the movie is based around.  
Most  of  the  births go ahead  as  planned,  however  the  scene 
involving  Meredith's  baby is quite gritty,  with  the  eventual 
birth being stillborn.   Things then quieten down for a couple of 
years or so.

The  doctor's wife had also been pregnant and had given birth  to 
what she thought was a normal healthy girl, whom she named Maara.  
One lunchtime,  when Maara was two years old or thereabouts,  she 
suddenly  gained the magical powers - causing her mother  to  put 
her  arm into a boiling pan of vegetables.   Shortly after  that, 
the doctor's wife then committed suicide, some would say with the 
help  of  her 'daughter'.   Other people also started to  die  in 
strange circumstances.

Shortly after this,  the movie goes forward a few more years,  to 
when  the children are starting at the local primary  school.   A 
lot  of  bizarre  'accidents'  happen  here,  one  involving  the 
caretaker (amongst others) who meet a violent death.

Soon,  however, after all of the deaths that have occurred in the 
town, the residents realise what is going on, and try to stop the 
children from hurting anyone else.  The only trouble is that they 
can't  - until the doctor finally manages to ensnare them  inside 
the  old hospital building (where they were previously born)  and 
blows the building up,  claiming the lives of all but one of  the 
children.

The child who is left,  David, had started to show emotion during 
the  movie - which none of the others had any of.   He  was  also 
present  at the rather shocking death of Meredith's character  in 
the  town's graveyard,  the reason for this was  that  Meredith's 
baby (had it survived) would have been David's mate.

Overall,  Village of the Damned is an excellent movie,  very well 
scripted  with  an excellent cast.   Despite the fact  that  John 
Carpenter has been involved with some not-so-good movies over the 
last few years,  I think he'll be turning the tables at last with 
this one.

LEGACY OF SIN (TV)

Most  movies  that are based on true stories  come  in  different 
shapes and sizes.   This one is largely the story of a guy called 
William Coit (played by Neil Patrick Harris - last seen in Doogie 
Howser  M.D.) and his lovely wife,  Robyn,  (played  by  Meredith 
Salenger).

The  movie starts off with William's mother getting married to  a 
guy called Gerald,  unbeknown to William, is the latest in a long 
line  of  guys  his mother has hitched up with  over  the  years.  
After  an  argument with his mother,  who told William  that  she 
wasn't happy about his choice of marriage partner,  they left the 
reception.

A  couple  of  weeks or so after this it is  time  for  William's 
birthday party, organised by Robyn.  During this party, William's 
uncle appeared and told him some startling news about his  mother 
and  the facts that she was involved with the murder of his  real 
father some years before.  William decides to set out to find the 
truth.

He goes over to Houston, Texas, where he meets up with the police 
department there who have the case unsolved on their  books.   So 
William  agrees to help them nail his mother and her  lover  (not 
Gerald) who, together, had disposed of his father.

A   thrilling  piece  of  film  follows  with  many   spectacular 
cliffhangers,  bringing the movie to a close with the result that 
William's   mother   and  her  lover  were  sentenced   to   life 
imprisonment, without possibility of parole.

This little known movie was shown on American TV channel - FOX TV 
- the same channel responsible for the 'X-Files'.   Let's hope it 
gets released to video officially soon!

Felice.
