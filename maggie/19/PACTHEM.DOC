                  Pac-Man, on the Falcon!?!

And after the break,  truecolour Space Invaders I suppose! What is 
this world coming to, as older and older games genres are pillaged 
ruthlessly for something new to do on the Falcon, but not too many 
original ideas please, might upset the children..

Load this one up, a screenfull of mess and corruption.. Think hard 
for  a little while,  try out various 'novelty' video modes on the 
Falcon,  eventually  Truecolour  does the trick..  Some very plain 
system  font (ZzzZ!) type lettering appears,  not too stunning  at 
all..  Hang  on,  a little pac-fellow is eating his way across the 
screen,  looks like a very nicely shaded truecolour sprite.. Let's 
wait  and  see  what comes next..  The main menu is  not  long  in 
following,  and  does  not  look too bad at all,  a very  Germanic 
production,  and  with a large number of colours very much to  the 
forefront..  Several  options,  including  'Spielen' ("play")  are 
listed, so it is with joystick in hand, I approach the game.. 

And  what a nice version it is!!  All the graphics onscreen are of 
the  same  high  standard as the 'taster'  sprite  and  main  menu 
screen..  The main characters,  Pac Man and Ghosts are depicted in 
real  truecolour,  and have a proper 'arcade' feel of a reasonable 
state  of  the art coin-op..  It looks and sounds like  an  arcade 
conversion of the sort where you simply transplant the coin-op CPU 
directly into your Falcon expansion port! 'Pac Man 2000' perhaps!

Both Paccy and the ghosts are very nicely drawn and animated,  the 
maze designs are fairly conventional,  but fit in with the overall 
high standard.. The standard play mechanics are still there, clear 
the dots onscreen,  powerpills await to turn the situation against 
the hungry ghosts..  One new twist to the familiar scenario is the 
use of teleports to the other side of the screen,  rather than the 
'wraparound' escape port of days gone by..

The  maze fills the whole screen area,  including heavy use of top 
and bottom borders in an RGB monitor overscan sort of way..

The  audio side matchs up,  with the appropriate range of  samples 
and squeaks in the game, and a reasonable tune out of it.. As with 
allup to date Atari entertainment software, the Jaguar Joypads, as 
well as the more conventional joysticks are catered for..

What more can I say, well, not a lot, as Pac Man is a 'seen it and 
done  it'  experience..  This version is up to the  high  standrds 
possible on the Falcon, and is well worth a good look..

(Shareware registration, about 25 DM, or local equivalent, and you 
get a rather promising looking free game,  'Ganymed',  a similarly 
truecolour type Asteroids game.. Well worth it, I say!!)

Ratings..

Graphix:-  91% - Very good use of truecolour on the  Falcon,  that 
is,  real deeply shaded truecolour, and transparent fading effects 
for dead ghosts and pacmen, and not truecolour masquerading as 256 
colours, or worse, sixteen!!

Sonix:-  80%  -  Proper  use  of  samples  in  the  right  places, 
reasonable out of game soundtrack..

Playability:- Say,  90% - Game mechanics handle very well, hard to 
go wrong on a long established genre such as this.. 

Overall:-  90% - Worth registering for the quality of  this  work, 
and for a shot at a free Asteroids type game as well!
