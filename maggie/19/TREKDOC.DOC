                              ================

             A naff little script type thing by Keefy for Maggie
             ===================================================

The Post Office lost the original, but I think I've managed to get most of it 
from an earlier back up.  Dunno if the ending is the same though.  Good ol' 
Knife ST.  I just hope you use the ruddy thing now Chris ???...

The scene
=========

The main bridge of  the Federation Starship Enterprise D,  slouching in
their chairs are Picard and Riker.  Worf is at his usual position, to 
the rear of the Captain, scowling and grumbling to himself. All the 
others are unknown extra's who probably won't utter anything other than 
'Aye Sir' throughout the rest of this episode type thing.  

<Enter Data through turbolift door>

<Unknown crew-member leaves his seat at ops, and Data promptly takes it>

Riker  : Well Mr Data ?

Data  : Yes Sir, I am fine, thankyou for asking.

Riker : No Data, that wasn't what I meant, did you get the problem with 
Spot sorted out?.

Data  : Yes Sir, she has now been confined to quarters until we reach 
Deep Space Nine.

Riker :  I thought Spot was male?.

Data : As did I Sir, however, it would seem that the people in 
continuity overlooked this, so I have concluded that Spot is in fact 
an Hermaphrodite.

<Picard gets up from his seat, straightens his uniform and walks over to 
Data, placing a hand on his shoulder>

Picard :  How long till we reach Deep Space Nine Mr Data?.

Data : Two hours forty minutes.

<Picard turns and looks at Riker>

Picard : Well Number One, it would seem that we have a rather large 
amount of free time on our hands, how do you fancy toddling off to the 
holodeck and involving yourself in one of those 'special' programs of 
yours?.  I can handle things here for a while.

Riker : Nahh, it's all right. <Grins> Besides, I want to save it all up 
for when we get to Deep Space Nine.  I hear Quark has obtained some 
rather interesting new holosuite programs.  The Sire women of Achia is 
of particular interest to me.

Picard <Smiles> : Randy git.

Riker:  Actually, I think we need to know a little more about why we're 
going to Deep Space Nine in the first place.  I certainly have no idea, 
and whoever is reading this right now will also want to know why.

Picard: Good point Will.  Well, you see it's like this, Several weeks 
ago, The Federation Starship Voyager left Deep Space Nine for the 
badlands.  It was looking for this Maquis terrorist vessel see.  Anyway, 
the Voyager has disappeared, so we've been told to try and find them 
somehow.  Or at least find out what the heck has happened to them.

Riker: I think they've got it now.

Picard: Good.

<Worf grunts loudly at the back, and falls straight over his console 
landing head-first in what would have been Deanna's seat if she had 
taken the time out to take her place on the bridge>

Riker:  What the hell are you doing Mr Worf.

<Worf shakes his head, and picks himself up gingerly, dusting himself 
down>

Worf <grunt> :  Sorry Sir, I seem to have dozed off temporarily

Riker: Are you all right?.

Worf: I am fine Sir, I just have a little bump on the front of my head.

Unknown Ensign <out of sight at the back>: That's all right, it will 
match the ones that you already have won't it?.

Worf : GROWL!!!!

<Exit unknown Ensign via turbolift door..... very quickly>

<Worf grins and has a feel of the bump on his head>

Picard: Worf, I think maybe you ought to go and see the Doctor for a 
quick check up.  That bump seems to be getting bigger by the second.

Worf: A warrior does not complain.

Picard: I didn't say you were complaining, but go and see the Doctor 
anyway, that's an order.

Worf <begrudgingly>: Aye Sir <Grunt>

<Enter Deanna via turbolift door>

Deanna: <smiling> : Hiya lover.

Worf: Grunt. <Walks right past Deanna into empty turbolift.> Sick bay!.

<Turbolift door closes>

<Deanna frowns, her look lingering on the turbolift door>

Deanna : Whats the matter with him, miserable sod didn't even give me a 
kiss.

<Riker shuffles uncomfortably in his chair>

Riker: Perhaps he dosen't love you any....

Picard:... Actually, I've sent him to sick bay because he has a rather 
large bump on his head.

Deanna: Whats wrong with his bumps?.

Picard: Not his normal ones, he just banged his head, so I've sent him 
to the Doctor for a check-up, as per usual he's moaning about it.

Deanna: Oh my poor grizzly, I'd better go and make sure he's all right.

<Exit Deanna via turbolift>

<Cut to Sickbay, Worf is sitting up uncomfortably on one of the beds 
whilst being mothered by both the Doctor and Deanna>

Doctor: <Holding a device at Worf's head>  Keep bloody still will you.

Worf: I AM keeping still.

Deanna: <Stroking Worf's hair> Come on dear, hold still now, and it will 
soon be over.

<Cut to external view of Enterprise at warp, stars streaking by>

<Cut back to main bridge some time later, crew-members present Data, 
Picard, Riker, Worf, along with various other extra's>

Data: Captain, I am detecting some form of sub-space anomoly dead ahead.

Picard: What sort of anomoly?.

Data: I am not quite sure Sir.

<The bridge is bathed in a bright white light, which quickly subsides, 
the crew appear to be unaware that anything has happened>

Data: I am not quite sure Sir.

Riker: What?.

Data: What what Sir?.

Riker: You just said that twice Data, is their something wrong with your 
systems or did you just say it twice to emphasis the point?.

Data: <Pauses, and cocks his head to one side>  I detect no errors, and 
my positronic brain has no record of my mentioning anything twice.

Picard: Well you did Mr Data, and why do you always cock your head to 
one side when you are thinking about something?.

Data: <Shrugs, and returns to his console>  The anomoly is now in visual 
range Captain.

Picard: On screen.

<The main viewscreen clears to reveal a swirling mass of white and 
purplish clouds>

Riker: Now where have I seen that before?.

Picard: Uh oh, looks like we're in for another time travel based 
episode.  

Data:  I believe you could be right Captain.

Worf:  Captain, a ship is coming through the anomoly.

Picard: Slow to impulse Ensign.

Unknown Ensign: Aye Sir.

<External view of the Enterprise coming out of warp, and taking up 
position in front of the swirling anomoly>

<Cut to viewscreen, where a large discshaped object is emerging from the 
cloud>

Riker: Is that the Enterprise C again, what are they doing here?.

Data: No Sir, but it is the Enterprise.

Riker: What a co-incidence, Which one?.

Data: The original Enterprise Sir.

Riker: Isn't it strange how these two Enterprise's just happen to be in 
the same place at the same time?.

Worf: The other Enterprise is hailing us, audio only.

Picard: On speakers.

'Speakers' : This is Captain James T Kirk of the U.S.S Enterprise, 
please identify.

<Picard and Riker look at each other momentarily> 

Picard: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the... <pauses> Federation 
Starship Enterprise, do you require assistance?.

Kirk: What do you mean, you're the Enterprise?, we're the Enterprise.  
Is this some sort of Romulan trick or something?.

Picard: I'm afraid not Sir.  It would seem we have a lot to talk about, 
if you would care to beam yourself aboard our vessel, we should be able 
to explain.

Kirk: I'm not beaming anywhere until I know who you really are, and what 
you are doing here?.

Data: Sir, StarFleet records state that the Enterprise is capable of 
visual communications, if the Ent...

Picard: Good idea Data.... Captain, if you would like to communicate 
with us visually, you will see that we are telling you the truth.

Kirk: I suppose so.

<Cut to Enterprise D viewscreen, an image of the original Enterprise 
bridge appears>

<Meanwhile, on the original Enterprise's viewscreen, a picture of the 
bridge of the Enterprise D appears>

Kirk: I knew it, I told you they were lying Spock, there's a bloody 
Klingon on that ship, and what the hell is that white skinned bloke down 
the front.  As for  those stupid costumes, even StarFleet wouldn't 
design stuff as bad as that.  

Riker: <Grinning> Funny, I was just thinking the same thing.

<Picard leaves his seat and makes his way to in front of the viewscreen>

Picard: Captain, there is a reason for all of this, if you would come 
aboard I will explain it to you.

Kirk: Not a chance mate, I ain't going on no ship with a Klingon on it, 
Sulu, ready main phasers and photon torpedoes. Sheilds up.

Sulu: Aye.

Spock  : <enters viewscreen visibility>: Sir, my sensor readings show 
that the other 'Enterprise' as they call themselves, has far more 
superior weaponry, and would almost definately defeat us in battle with 
ease.

Kirk: What are you saying?.

Spock: I am saying that it would be logical to try and discover whether 
they are telling the truth or not.  I volunteer to beam aboard their 
vessel.  

Kirk: You're always so damn logical.  Okay, let's go aboard.  Redshirt, 
you're with us.

Unknown redshirted officer: Aye Sir.

<Spock, Kirk and Red shirt exit original Enterprise bridge via 
turbolift.>

<A short time later, in the Enterprise D's transporter room, Spock and 
Kirk materialise on the transporter pad, both look around.  Present are 
Riker, Picard, O'Brien (at the transporter controls), Worf (phaser 
drawn) and Deanna Troi> 

Kirk: What happened to redshirt?.

O'Brien: I'm sorry, we lost his pattern in mid transport.  Something to 
do with redshirts always being one of the first to die in any episode of 
the original series.

Kirk: Oh, thats all right then.  <Notices Worf, and promptly hides 
behind Spock>

Picard: It's all right, I can explain, but first, let me welcome you 
aboard the Enterprise.  

<Picard shakes hands with both Spock and Kirk, then introduces the 
others>

<Cut to briefing room, seated around the large table, Riker, Picard, 
Kirk, Spock, Deanna, Beverley, Data, Worf and Geordi>

Kirk: Right then, what the hecks going on?.

Data: Captain, if I may?.

Picard: Go ahead Mr Data.

Data: Captain Kirk, you have just experienced what is known as a time 
hole, and are now in what is known as the 24th century.  Approximately 
100 years from where you were previously.  

Spock: I see, and how did you come to arrive at this hypothesis?.

Data: Our analysis of the anomoly has revealed that it is an eruption in 
the space-time continuum, very similar to several others we have 
encountered previously.  Unfortunately, this particular anomoly, is not 
as stable as most and has collapsed upon itself.

Kirk: So, this ship is the Enterprise in the future, it looks completely 
different, must have undergone a complete overhaul, I'm not sure that 
Scotty would approve.

Data: Scotty... ah yes, the ships engineer aboard your Enterprise.  In 
fact, Sir, this is a completely new Enterprise, the original Enterprise 
was in fact...

Picard: Data, that's enough for now, don't forget, we musn't tell them 
anything that may affect the normal course of history.

Kirk: So how many Enterprises are there?.

Picard: This is the Enterprise D.  The fourth.

Kirk: So what happened to all the others?.

Picard: I'm afraid we can't tell you that.

Kirk: Okay, so if you can't tell me anything like that, can you tell me 
why there is a Klingon on your ship, and a robot as well.

Spock: Jim, the correct term is android.

Data: Thankyou Mr Spock.

Kirk: Oh for crying out loud, you know what I meant.  Anyway, so how 
many of you mechanical guys are there?.

Data: There have been 3 Soong type androids that I am aware of.  
However, I am the only one currently serving with StarFleet.

Kirk: I suppose that you are superior to humans in ......

Spock : ...Captain, I would suggest that we refrain from idle 
conversation and occupy ourselves with trying to find a way of returning 
to our own time.

Data : I am afraid that it may not be possible for you to return to your 
own time Mr Spock.  Since the anomoly has collapsed there is no way for 
you to return to your own time.

Kirk: You mean we're stuck here!.

Data : For the time being, I am afraid so Captain.  

Kirk : So what do we do now ?.

Picard : I would suggest that you accompany us to Deep Space Nine.  We 
have notified Starfleet, and arrangements will be made there to sort 
this matter out.  In the meantime, I suggest you avail yourselves of the 
comforts on board the Enterprise D.

Spock : Captain, perhaps Doctor McCoy and Chief Engineer Scott would 
also like to beam aboard.  I am sure they would find the technological 
advances made in their respective feilds of interest... interesting.  
Meanwhile, I shall return to the Enterprise... our Enterprise, and 
prepare the ship for departure.

Kirk: Good idea Number One, make it so...... I've been on this ship too 
long already, I think I'll join you.


<Cut to external view of both ships travelling at warp some time later>

<Cut to Enterprise D, Ten Forward.  Scotty and McCoy are enjoying a 
drink of whiskey with Riker, Geordi and Crusher.>

Riker: So, Mr Scott, what do you think of this Enterprise?.

Scotty : <accent omited because I don't want to insult Scottish people 
by trying to write with a Scottish accent when I can't>  Call me Scotty 
Commander.  What do I think of the Enterprise?.  She's big, roomy, a 
nice ship.  A few too many computers around for my liking though, in my 
day we used to ....

Geordi: What did you think of Engineering?, last time you seemed quite 
amazed with what we have achieved with the Enterprise.

Scotty: Last time ?.

<Riker glares at Geordi, Geordi gulps>

Geordi : Never mind.

Riker <Whispering to Geordi> : Don't forget, they musn't know anything 
about their future's, although we know that both of them have been on-
board before, as far as they are concerned, they never have.

Geordi <Whispering to Riker>: I know, I just let it slip out.  

McCoy : So, have you managed to find a cure for the common cold yet Miss 
Crusher?.

Beverly : It's Mrs actually, but just call me Beverly.  In answer to 
your question, yes we have found a cure for the common cold.

McCoy : and what about Parkinson's disease, and Freudian Degeneration 
syndrome, and....

Beverly : I'm sorry, even if we know how these diseases are cured, I'm 
afraid I can't tell you anything about it.

McCoy : But you have knowledge which could save thousands of lives, and 
since it seems we have no way of getting home anyway, I don't see what 
difference it would make, for christs......

Riker: I'm sorry, Doctor, the reason we can't tell you these things is 
because we happen to know that you will at sometime or other in the near  
future return to your own time, and that anything we tell you now will...

McCoy: Well I've had enough of this crap, I'm going back to my own ship.

Scotty : Me too, that Geordi fellah won't even tell me where they get the
dilithium crystals from nowadays.  

<Exit McCoy and Scotty>

<Cut to external view of Deep Space Nine, both of the Enterprises are docked 
at the outer docking rings>

<Cut to Quarks, the entire bar is filled with various Starfleet personnel from
both ships Picard and Kirk are chatting at one of the tables>

Picard : So this... Corbomite manuever, it never actually existed ?.

Kirk: Nope, but it fooled the chap long enough for us to sort it all out.

Picard: In a way its a good job that the alien was friendly.

Kirk: Damn right, if he had wanted to, he could have beat the living crap 
out of us.

<Both are rudely interupted by Quark> 

Kirk: Urgh, what the hell is that?.

Picard: It's Quark, a Ferengi, he probably want to sell you something.

Quark: <Smiling> Now Captain, there's no need to be like that, I merely wanted
to tell the Captain about our holosuite facilities.

<Quark puts his arm around Kirk>

<Kirk frowns, and glares at Quark>

Quark: Maybe not.  Another time perhaps?.

<Quark retreats back to his bar, watching Kirk all the way.> 


<Cut to holosuite door, doors open and Riker staggers out>

Riker: Phew.

<Riker gradually stumbles up to the bar>

Quark: What can I get you Commander?.  How about a Tulaberry wine, since the 
Grand Nagus bought all those berries, we've got tons of the stuff lying around.
It's really refreshing, just what you need after a bit of exercise.

Riker: Go on then, but make it a double.

Quark: So what did you think of it then?. <whilst pouring Riker's drink and 
handing it to him.>

Riker: Brilliant, absolutely fantastic, I hope you've still got that program
when we pass through next time.

Quark: Well, if you like it that much, I can let you have it, for a price 
of course.

Riker: I'll tell you what, you can have all the latinum that I won on the 
tables earlier for it.

Quark: Seems fair.  It's yours.

<Riker is suddenly distracted, by someone walking past>

Riker: Excuse me.

<Riker gets up and goes after whoever distracted him.>

Riker: Thanks for the drink.

Quark: You watch yourself Commander, her bites much worse than her bark.
                                                    
<Cut to another part of Quark's, Dax has just sat down with a drink, Riker 
approaches>

Riker: <Pointing to a chair opposite Dax>: Mind if I join you?.

Dax: <looks up, smiling> Go ahead.

Riker: Can I get you a drink?.

Dax: Thanks, but I already have one.

Riker: So, what have you been doing with yourself today?.

Dax: I've been busy.

Riker: Doing what?.

Dax: Just busy.

Riker: Listen, I've got a couple more hours free time before I have to report
back for duty, how about me and you go for a walk or something along the 
promenade?.

Dax: No thanks, I've got to go and report myself, it looks like we'll be 
accompanying you on the trip.

Riker: <smiling> You mean you'll be coming with us?.

Dax: I'll be on the Defiant of course.  But maybe we can meet up some other 
time.

Riker: Maybe.....

<exit Riker>

<Dax smiles, then finishes her drink before leaving>


<Cut to external view of Deep Space Nine, Enterprise D leaves the docking ring,
closely followed by the Defiant>

<Cut to the bridge of the Enterprise D, all command crew are present>

Picard: Lay in a course for the badlands Ensign.

Unknown Ensign: Aye Sir.

Worf: The Defiant is ready Captain.

Picard: Very good Mr Worf, Ensign en....

Worf : .... Sir, the Enterprise is also leaving Deep Space Nine.

Riker: What the hell are they playing at?.

Picard: Hail them Mr Worf.

Worf: They are responding.

Picard: On screen.

Worf: Aye Sir.

<Kirk and the Enterprise bridge appears on the main viewscreen>

Kirk: Greetings Captain Picard, and what can I do for you?.

Picard: Where are you going Captain?.

Kirk: We're coming with you.

Picard: I'm afraid thats not possible, we're going on a very dangerous 
mission.

Kirk: Great, I love dangerous missions, besides, you don't honestly think we
are going to just sit here and wait for the time when we go back to our own 
time do you?.

Picard: But you can't come Captain.

Kirk: We're coming whether you like it or not mate.  

<Cut to external view of the Enterprise, Defiant and Enterprise D entering 
Warp>

<Cut to bridge of Defiant, on board are all of the main DS9 crew>

Kira: We're approaching the badlands Commander.

Sisko: Take us out of warp, and activate the cloaking device.

O'Brien: Er, Sir.  I'm afraid that the cloaking device is inoperative.

Sisko: Inoperative?, how come I wasn't informed earlier.

O'Brien: We only just found out when we tried to activate it just a minute ago
In fact, my readings show that the cloaking device isn't even installed.

Sisko: Not even installed!.

O'Brien: No Sir, it's just gone.

Sisko: So what the hell has happened to it then?, has someone stolen it, or
have the Romulans taken it back or what?.

O'Brien: I have no idea.

Odo: I have an idea who might have taken it.  I saw that Quark skulking 
around near the docking ring earlier.  A tenner says it was him that nicked 
the device.

Dax: How come you always blame Quark whenever anything goes missing?.

Odo: Because it's always him thats responsible.

Dax: Not always surely?.

Odo: Okay maybe not all the time, but most of the time.  Lets just say 95% of 
the time shall we?.

Sisko: I take it the cloaking device is no-where on board the Defiant?.

O'Brien: Fraid not Sir.  The logs say that it was removed whilst still 
at the station.

Sisko: Does it say who took it?.

O'Brien: No, all records pertaining to that fact have been erased.

Sisko: Okay, send a message back to the station, get them to search the
entire station until they find it.  No one is to leave or board the station 
until its found.  In the meantime, we have a mission to accomplish.  So the 
cloaking device will have to wait for now.

O'Brien: Isn't it weird that despite our having all this nifty computer stuff 
lying around, people are still always able to nip in and nick stuff from 
under our very noses.

Dax: Wouldn't have much in the way of stories otherwise would we ?.

<Cut to external view of the three ships entering the badlands, swirly bits 
and all>

<Cut to Enterprise D bridge>

Riker: Well, thats the special effects budget for this one all tied up.

Data: Not quite Sir, we've got a couple of quid left for maybe one or two 
more phaser shots.

<Ship rocks violently, everyone falls to the floor, after a second or two, 
everyone picks themselves up>

Picard: Report !.

Data: We appear to have encountered some kind of temporal time and space 
phasing distortion anomoly.

Riker: In English Data.

Data: Somethings chucked us to the other side of the Galaxy.

Picard: What about the other ships.

Troi: They're here with us Captain, I can sense them.  I can also sense... 
<dramatic pause> someone else.....

Worf: Sir, we are being hailed.... by the Enterprise, Defiant, and... the 
U.S.S. Voyager.

Picard: We'll answer Voyager first.... on screen.

<Screen fizzles and eventually clears to reveal the face of Captain Janeway>

Janeway: Well, well, well, whats a nice StarFleet captain like you doing in a  
place like this?.

Riker: Wow!, it's Katherine Hepburn, I've always fancied her.

Picard: <glowers at Riker> I could ask you the same question Captain Janeway.

Janeway: An entity called the Caretaker brought us here, one minute we're in 
the badlands, the next we're here.  We've been trying to get home, but every 
now and then we come across something interesting and stop to investigate and 
now we're back where we left off.

Picard: Maybe if we all work together we can figure out a way to get back.  

Janeway: Sure, If the Captains of all three ships beam over we can have a 
chat and see if we come up with something.

Tuvok: <Out of shot> May I remind you Captain, our energy shortage problem?.

Janeway: Quite right, Tuvok, maybe your ship would be better Captain?.

Picard: See you in five minutes, Picard out.

<Cut to Enterprise D briefing room, Present are Picard, Riker, Kirk, Spock, 
Sisko, Kira, Janeway and Chakotay>

Janeway: thanks for the coffee Captain, haven't had a decent one in ages.  I 
had one that Neelix made from some grubs he found the other day, but it just 
wasn't the same.

<Data enters the room and takes a seat>

Picard: Right, lets get down to business, how're we going to get back.

Data: Myself and Geordi have been working on several theories as to how we 
got here, and we have only one which fits the circumstances.

Kirk: Which is...?.

Data: When Voyager was brought here by the Caretaker, after effects were left 
behind in the form of sub space waves.

Kirk: You mean like waves in the sea ?.

Data: Not exactly, there are many differences, for example, the sea is wet, 
space is not.

Kirk: Are you being sarcastic?, you know what I meant.

Spock: The Commander was merely stating a fact Jim. 

Kirk: So how do we get back then Mr Smarty pants android ?.

Data: I have been unable to find a solution as of yet.

Picard: Well, I suggest we all get back to work and see if we can find ut 
anything else.

<Cut to external view of all four ships>

<Cut to bridge of Voyager>

Kim: Sir, I'm detecting 2 Kazon ships approaching at high warp.

<Cut to bridge of Defiant> 

Kira: 2 unidentified vessels approaching.

<Cut to bridge of Enterprise>

Spock: Sensors are detecting two vessels heading for this vicinity.

<Cut to bridge of Enterprise D>

Worf: 2 ships approaching, high warp.

Picard: Can you identify?.

Worf: Negative Sir, they may be indiginous to this region of space.

Picard: Are we in visual range?.

Worf: Yes Sir.

Picard: Put them on viewer.

<Image of the two ships appear on screen>

<Worf's console beeps a few times>

Worf: Sir, Captain Janeway is hailing us.

Picard: On screen.

<Screen image of the ship is replaced with Janeway's face>

Riker: She's a looker, isn't she?.
 
Janeway: I suggest you raise your shields Captain, the Kazon are not 
particularly friendly.

Picard: Thanks, I'll warn the others, Picard out.

<Cut to external of the 4 federation ships, with the 2 Kazon ships in front 
of them>

<Cut to Voyager bridge>

Tuvok: Captain, one of the Kazon ships is hailing us.

Janeway: On screen.

<Image of a Kazon officer appears on screen>

Kazon: I know what you are up to Janeway, and it won't work.  Our fleet is 
heading for this sector as we speak.  Your invasion fleet will fail.

Janeway: This is no invasion fleet, we just want to go home that's all.

Kazon: A likely story, the presence of your four ships is clearly an 
aggressive act, and it will not be tolerated.

<Suddenly, the Kazon ship shudders, and fires can be seen in the background>

<Cut to external view of Kazon ship exploding in a ball of flames>

Janeway: What happened ?.

Tuvok: The Enterprise fired a volley of photon torpedoes at the Kazon vessel, 
it has been destroyed.

Janeway: Get me Kirk.

<Kirk's face appears on screen>

Kirk: What can I do for you Captain?.

Janeway: What the hell do you think you were doing ?.

Kirk: I got fed up with all this sitting around, so I thought I'd relieve the 
boredom a little.

<Bridge of Enterprise shudders violently>

Kirk: Looks like it worked, Kirk out.

<Cut to external view of the original Enterprise and Kazon ships exchanging 
fire a few times>

<Cut to Enterprise Engineering>

Scotty: <to the bridge> Captain, she can't take much more of this, she'll 
blow.

<Cut to external view of the battle, the Enterprise throws a few more volleys 
of photons at the Kazon ship, and the weapon fire stops>

<Cut to Enterprise D bridge>

Riker: What the hell is going on?.

<Cut to Defiant bridge>

Sisko: What the hell is going on?.

<Cut back to Enterprise>

Picard: Hail the Enterprise.

Worf: We are the Enterprise.

Picard: You know what I meant.

Worf: Captain Kirk responding.

Picard; On screen.

<Kirk appears on screen>

Kirk: Well, that was a bit of fun wasn't it?.  You could have given us a hand 
though.

Picard: Not a chance, you want to start a fight out here, do it your self.

Worf: Sir, the Kazon ship is heading directly at the Enterprise.

Kirk: Us or you?.

Worf: You.

Kirk: Oops.....

<Cut to external view of Enterprise exploding in a ball of flame as the Kazon 
ship collides with it>
 
<Cut back to Enterprise D bridge>

Picard: Well, thats them out of the way.

Data: You do realise Sir, that since the Enterprise has been destroyed, our 
history will be irrevocably changed.  Many things that would have happened 
had they remained alive will now not happen.  The Klingon / Federation 
alliance, the saving of Earth several times.

Picard: Computer, end program.

<Enterprise bridge dissolves into a black room with a yellow grid all around 
it.  Only Picard and Riker remain>

Picard: Well, that was interesting wasn't it?.

Riker: Not really, I was getting a bit bored.

Picard: Just imagine though, all that was nothing more than a holodeck re-
creation of what could happen if we all got together.

Riker: I doubt it Sir, more like Keefy was getting bored with typing out this 
story and thought hup the quickest ending he could come up with.

Both: Nahh!!.....
