                                MAGGIE NEWSROUND
                                ----------------

Here we go with another selection of tales  from the wide and wonderful world of
Atari! This news is presented in a sort of chronological/as it arrived order and
some of it has picked up more coverage elsewhere in the magazine.

If you have any news about your  forthcoming Atari productions, please drop us a
line!


[] BUILT IN VGA OBSELESENCE

There will be no VGA version of  Digital Chaos's "BIO" demo. This was originally
planned but Tat was unhappy with the  framerate  and the source code for the VGA
version has since been deleted. The monochrome version is also on hold.

[] NEW DIGITAL CHAOS DEMO

Better news from the Digital Chaos  camp  is  that  there will be a spanking new
Falcon demo. When we  last  saw  him,  Tat  was  buying  a  book  on the DSP and
muttering  something  about  "getting   EKO".   The   effects  will  be  heavily
concentrated on 3D dsp stuff with SH3/RG designing some objects.

[] SENIOR DADS RETURN

Heroes of the Fried Bits  III  96ktro  competition,  "The Senior Dads", who have
already built up a cult following after their revolutionary "Anal Tuck" demo are
working on a new Falcon  demo.  Main  coder,  "Nonce",  commented "its like some
pictures, but different". We can't wait.

[] INCUBATOR UPDATE

NPG are still working furiously on their  game. Originally titled "BOOM", it has
now changed its name  to  "Incubator"  and  will  hopefully be released sometime
soon.

[] ADRENALINE DIE

French demo crew Adrenaline are no more.  They released some nice demos over the
years and will be missed. Before you shed  too  many tears, cheer up as the main
members of Adrenaline  have  formed  a  new  crew  "EXA"  and  have  released an
excellent Falcon demo "Evolution".

[] PSYCHOSIS ARRIVE

A new UK Falcon demo crew have  arrived  on the scene. They are called Psychosis
and their first demo features  some  excellent  pictures  ported from the amiga.
Their main coder is  called  Al  and  used  to  be  in  the Untouchables. I have
recieved two versions  of  this  demo,  but  apparently  there  are still slight
problems with it. A 100% bug free  version  should  be  out by the time you read
this.

[] CROUR GAME

German demo crew, "Crour", famous for their  96ktro  at Fried Bits 3 are working
on a game. Entitled "Panium Disaster", graphics artist Zweckform describes it as
"a wings of death like game, in 320  x  240 true colour working on RGB and VGA".
Sounds good!

[] PACMAN HITS THE FALCON

Atari favourite "Pacman" has now  a  Falcon  incarnation  in  the form of German
shareware game "Pac-Them". Featuring lovely true  colour graphics and some funny
samples, this is well worth looking out  for. Registered users get a true colour
asteroids game.

[] NEW THERAPY DEMO

Therapy, creators of FB3 demo  "Function  Main"  are  currently working on a new
demo. More details of this as they arrive.

[] CZECH REPUBLIC FALCONS

Falcons in Czech Republic shock! Soma, the  crew behind the Hover '94 demo, have
finished their game. Entitle "Gravon" it is  a 3D hovercraft game with some very
nicely shaded polygon graphics. Well  worth  looking  out  for.  It is getting a
commercial release in the UK via JRC.

[] DOUBLE BOBBLE 2000 RELEASED

Finally, Reservoir Gods  seminal  "Double  Bobble  2000"  has  been  released on
shareware. Registered users get a new  Double  Bobble game plus the level editor
so don't foget to support shareware authors!

[] NEW AVENA DEMO

Contrary to other reports, some members  of  Avena  are  working on a new Falcon
demo. We have seen some very early  previews  which feature some very nice Bump-
mapping. After their exellent Fried Bits 3  demo,  this will certainly be one to
look out for. These effects may be released under the name of a new crew.

[] MAGGIE 18 IN ATARI WORLD

Top UK Atari Mag  "Atari  World"  will  be  featuring  a  review  of Top UK disk
magazine "Maggie". Check out issue 7 for the full review.

[] TAUTOLOGY II IN TOP TEN

Top UK  Atari  Mag,  "ST  Format"  has  voted  the  Reservoir  Gods  puzzle game
"Tautology II" amongst the top ten  pieces  of Falcon PD software ever released.
Well done ST Format, we promise never to slag you off again. Well not much.

[] RESERVOIR RACING UPDATE

The Reservoir gods 3D car  game  has  picked  up  a  lot of commercial interest,
noticably from Impact Software. After seeing  the  latest preview, it is hard to
believe this is just and ST game! The words "fast" and "smooth" spring to mind.

[] INTER GAME

Maggie hears rumours that Inter are  working  on  a  game based on their wolf-3D
routines as seen in "Obnoxious" and "Terrorise  Your  Soul". More news as we get
it.
* UPDATE * Lucky tells maggie that  the  game  is  called "Arena" and he is busy
working on it at the moment. Look  out  for  an  interview with LoST in a future
issue of Maggie.

[] CASPIAN ON JAGUAR

Caspian software, publishers of undersea platform game "Rock 'n' Roll Clams" and
3D space shooter "Zero-5" are  now  concentrating  their  efforts on the Jaguar.
Their first release looks likely to be....Zero 5.

[] ADDICTION RPG

Addiction Software, authors of Rainbow  Paint  and  Rainbow Paint Multimedia are
currently working on some Falcon games, the first one rumoured to be an RPG.

[] DODGY SCSIS


Some Atari Falcons have  problems  interfacing  with  external SCSI hard drives.
There seems to be a problems  when  transferring  larges  amounts of data to and
from SCSI drives. This hardware problem  has  been  fixed on the newest Falcons,
but not on mine! I have written a  software patch to circumvent this problem, so
if you are having trouble with your SCSI, drop me a line and I will send you the
patch.

[] AGGRESSION'S PARKLIFE

Top coding team "Aggression", responsible for demos such as "Overdose" on the ST
and asteroids game "Stardust" are  working  on  a  Falcon demo. Entitled "Motion
Blur" it fortunatly has little to do with the chart topping british pop band. As
well as the effect of motion blur  there  are  a  lot cool vectors part and some
wolf-3d stuff. Main coding on  the  demo  is  by  a  new very talented DSP coder
called Wiztom.

[] AGGRESSIVE II PARTY

Aggression are organising  a  big  demo  party  in  Finland  over christmas. The
gathering will be for owners of  Falcons,  STs,  PCs and Amigas and the machines
will compete head to head in the demo competitions. A number of atari crews will
be releasing productions at this party.

[] DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY ARE ALIVE

Swedish crew DHS are working on a number  of Falcon productions. There will be a
demo for the Aggressive II party. This  will  be a Falcon production and use the
DSP for some cool vector effects.
DHS are also working on a game  called  "Stargate  2000". They are being paid by
the Swedish government to program it!

[] LAZER BREAKDOWN

Lazer, who have just completed the intro  for DBA14, are suffering from a broken
Falcon. The machine belonging to Engergizer  is  no longer working! He is hoping
to fix it or buy a new one so he can release the Independent music compilation 3
which is sitting on his hard drive.

[] ABSENCE ARRIVE

A new and very exciting Falcon crew  have arrived on the scene. Called "Absence"
they have members from a lot of famous demo groups. There members are drawn from
Avena, Aura and Newline and include The Innovator (who worked on "Terrorise your
Soul") and  graphics  artist  Stallion  (who  organised  Fried  Bits  3).  Their
productions should really be worth looking out for.

[] PSYCHOSIS DOOMED

New british crew Psychosis are working on a Doom style game for the Falcon. Main
coder Al tells disk maggie "my  main  priorities  are speed and gameplay. I have
worked out a system involving the  DSP  that  should  allow me to run theo whole
game between 25 and 17.5 fps on a TV/RGB monitor regardlesss of how many sprites
are on screen." Sounds promising!

[] UDS LEAVE ATARI SCENE

Unique Developments Sweden have announced they  will not be releasing any future
products on the STe/Falcon  as  they  are  too  busy  with  their  PC and Jaguar
productions. They produced two  excellent  games  (Substation and Obsession) and
will be sadly missed. We wish them all the best with their future career.

[] DOUBLE BOBBLE 2000 CROWNED

Falcon platform game "Double Bobble 2000"  has been awarded the exceptional mark
of 96% in the latest issue of ST  Format.  This is the highest mark any game has

ever recieved in the hallowed pages of  this  magazine.  We are not ones to blow
our own trumpet (parp!) but it is pats on the back and trebles all round.

[] FOLLOW YOUR IMPULSE

Swedish crew will released the final  version  of  "Bugs From Outer Space", sans
the bugs we hope, very soon.  They  have  also  released a nice but short Falcon
intro entitled "Angest" and are currently involved  in coding a Falcon game that
will run in true colour mode.

[] THE BLACK LOTUS RETURN

Enigmatic Swedish crew  "The  Black  Lotus",  responsible  for  the  Falcon demo
"Relics" (see Maggie 18) have some more products in the pipeline. Tolmo from the
group tells maggie of 3 new productions for the Falcon. The first will be a main
Falcon030 demo (provisional title "to  the  hilt).  The  second  will be a music
compilation with tunes composed by Hermes. The third is a "Midi-Sampler-Toolbox"
a product as yet unseen on the Falcon. More details as we get them.

[] SWEDISH DOOM

A team of Swedish coders are  also  working  on the seemingly impossible task of
converting DooM to the Falcon. Details are sketchy but one of the men behind the
job is Johan Klockars (coder of picture  tool  mgif). It looks like there are to
be quite a few texture mapped  games  released  on our favourite bird, but which
will be the best? We'll have to wait and see.

[] TSCC RECORD LABEL

TSCC authors of Dynabusters and co-authors of Terrorise Your Soul are setting up
a record label on which they  will  release  modules! This is an innovative idea
and some of their  label  music  compilations  are  already  available on floppy
disks. The group are also working on  a midi-linked version of Dynabusters which
promises to be excellent. Rumour reaches Maggie  that TSCC are also working on a
DSP assembler.

[] RESERVOIR GODS FALL FROM GRACE

The next game from  top  Falcon  coding  team  "The  Reservoir  Gods"  will be a
multiplayer puzzle game in the style of Tautology II. Coder Mr. Pink told Maggie
"Skyfall is a very cool game. Up to  4 players can play simultaneously and their
are nice effects like pixel explosions, sprite  scaling and of course a stomping
techo tune by SH3. The  game  is  also  frighteningly addictive!". Sounds one to
watch out for.

[] MR COKE PUZZLED

Ex-avena man Mr. Coke is putting the finishing touches to his puzzle game. Coded
in his beloved GFA basic it  promises  to  be  an excellently presented and very
playable game.

[] ICE HAVE NOT PACKED IN

Contrary to other reports, Swedish group ICE  are still going. The Inner Circuit
Explorers, famous for their legendary STe  demos,  have recently released a game
for the STe  and  Falcon.  With  help  from  Impulse  they  created Sokoban, the
infamous "push the blocks about"  game  which  is also worryingly addictive. You
can even create your own levels.

[] HYRDOXID FLOW BACK

French demo crew Hydroxid are busy  at  work  on  the  follow up to this summers
"Realm of Depth". Here at Maggie we have been sent previews of their new effects
and they are certainly a big  step  up  from RoD. There are distorting textures,
great plasma and 3D dot  shapes  amongst  other  things.  This release should be
ready early next year and it is certainly one to watch out for.

[] NEW GRAOUMF

Graoumf tracker, which has already earned the title of "best Falcon tracker" has
recently been updated with  new  features  and  some  bug  removals. If you have
already registered, send a disk and an  SAE  for the new version. If you haven't
registered (and why not?) now is the time to support this great program.

[] SENIOR DADS HIT THE NET

The very foundations of the information superhighway were left shaking yesterday
as the Senior Dads announced they would  be  setting up their own World Wide Web
site. Described by dsp coder, doddering  git,  as  "senior  - in the extreme" it
draws net surfers into a senior world.  All  dads  demos to date can be download
from this site, including the new 69ktro.

[] ATARI AGGRESSIVE AWARDS

Preliminary reports from the Agrressive II party suggest that the atari platfrom
did exceptionally well in all  categories  -  notable winners include Aggression
and Dead Hackers Society. More news as we get it.
