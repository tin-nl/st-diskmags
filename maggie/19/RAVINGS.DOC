                          GARY SIMMONS

Some  assorted  new stuff,  with one or two bits  of  pro-Asciilum 
propaganda mixed in as well - CiH..

A  joint venture by Apple,  Mitsubushi and the  toy  manufacturer 
Bandai are  releasing  in the USA a  complete  multimedia  system 
called  PIPPIN  that  will  connect to  a  standard  TV.  It  was 
originally  planned to be released by Christmas but has been  put 
back to early 1996.

The  huge database company ORACLE launches next year a  low  cost 
computer  (target  price less than 400) which  will  give  VIDEO 
access to the internet.

Atari  are  in the news again,  but unfortunately for  the  wrong 
reason  (when  will  they learn!!).  After much  hype  about  the 
Virtual  Reality consule they are producing it has been  released 
that  the company they were in partnership with  (called  Virtual 
Reality - strangely enough!) has fallen out with them BIG TIME.
There  will not now be a new consule and Virtual Reality  are  in 
discussions with another major player in the games market.

The  head of INTEL (whose name escapes me) says  65,000,000  PC's 
will  be sold this year and by the year 2000 the forecast is  for 
ONE  BILLION.  I  wish  I could ask him if he  means  an  English 
billion or an American billion - there's a lot of difference!

In October the National Lottery sold its BILLIONTH scratch  card. 
However,  they also reported that 180 people won the first  prize 
of  50,000  -  that means you have a 1 to  5,500,000  chance  of 
winning the first prize. I think this is madness as statistically 
you have more chance of being murdered - LITERALLY.

STELLAR  DISKMAG run by Mark Nobes is no more!!!  A sad  loss  as 
good contributers to the Atari scene such as Mark will be  sorely 
missed.  I understand lack of time was the cause but this will at 
least mean that Mark can devote himself more to STELLAR PDL.

Microsoft  boss BILL GATES has bought one of the  worlds  largest 
photo  collections totalling 16,000,000 images. He has  plans  to 
license them in the form of software and online.

SUPER STARIOLAND is one of the success stories of the summer. The 
game  by TOP BYTE SOFTWARE has taken off in a big way with orders 
well in excess of those anticipated.  Great reviews by the glossy 
mags have helped and word is  that ST FORMAT pleaded for a demo.
Starioland can be purchased from ASCIILUM PDL.

One of the ST's best known diskmags has recently celebrated its 
5th birthday,  well done MAGGIE.  I hear that the editors  C.I.H. 
and FELICE may be writing guest articles for ST WORLD. Who knows, 
they may even become regulars?

             -----======>>>>>>><*><<<<<<<======----- 

I  recently read an interview in the greatly  respected  American 
diskmag  A-ONLINE with Jeff Minter.  He stated that he  had  many 
more registrations for the incredible LLAMATRON from ST users than 
from  either the PC or AMIGA users.  His total registrations  was 
well in excess of 2000 (including mine!).

USA internet providers are gradually taking over UK net providers. 
EUNet  GB  have  already been taken  over  this  year,  UUNET  is 
currently negotiating for UNIPALM and NETCOM has plans to  expand 
into  the UK.  The UK firm DEMON intends to stay independant  and 
has just raised 5.5m to expand its service.

IMPACT UK,  the creators of the excellent value educational menus 
are now up to release number 15.  However FLINTSTONE of IMPACT UK 
is  so productive that by the time you read this he has  probably 
released yet another.  The educational disks are a good selection 
of all the best educational programs compacted onto disks to give 
good value for money.

A couple of new diskmags have appeared for the ST in the last 
couple of months. The B.O.S. was a 2 disk effort for issue 1 with 
a nice shell and loads of articles, ST WORLD issue 1 was put 
together with TOMS and Intro Concept but word is that they are 
expecting a customised shell soon. All diskmags need support,(*) 
especially new ones, so if you want a copy of either or both 
you can order them by name from ASCIILUM PDL. 
   (*)Especially MAGGIE - Ed..)

That  sick  and evil man FRED WEST who murdered all  those  young 
girls  deserved a fate worse than suicide - but his  name  seemed 
strangely familiar and I could not remember where I had heard  it 
before. Then it came to me!, it's the name of a small program for 
the Atari. Unbelievably someone has created a printer spooler and 
called  it FRED WEST.  For those who are sceptical of this  weird 
bit of info check out ST REVIEW, DEC '94 issue 34 as it was given 
away on the cover disk. Ain't life strange!!!

Who  says games are dead on the Atari?  I was speaking  to  ROBIN 
KEEN of Desert Star Software,  the creators of HOLLYWOOD  HUSTLER 
the  other day and he tells me that there has been more  response 
from the Atari platform than either the Amiga or PC.

ATARI  UPDATE the new A5 size Atari mag has finished  after  only 
one issue. It's a shame for two reasons, the first is we could do 
with another mag - even if it was a ST HANDBOOK clone. The second 
is  that I spent money promoting it and I feel a bit  hacked  off 
about it. It's not just the money,I feel I may have lost a bit of 
credibility with the people who ordered it from me.

POWER diskmag is no longer being produced by James L Mathews  but 
word is out that TRONIC of EFFECT is about to take over. I  don't 
know if this 100% fact yet as I have not heard from Tronic but  I 
think it will be happening.
