     Hi! Del here .. Good grief, has yet another Christmas come
around already? It only seems about twelve months since the last
one was here .. Ah well, tempest fugit, so a very merry Christmas
to all you guys at 'Maggie' HQ and indeed to all Atari fans where-
ever you are .. and may Dame Fortune smile on each and every one
of you in '96!

     The weeks which ran up to Christmas in my old computer
hardware/software and PD shop used to be great .. everyone in
such a happy seasonal mood (?) and only too ready to smile and
enjoy a laugh (?), and laughs we had a plenty in those run-up
days to the festive season.

     For example, a good looking teenage girl walked up to the
counter the day before Christmas and said, 'I want an Amiga
game for my boyfriend's Christmas present. How much are they?'.
'That all depends on how much you love him', I replied tongue
in cheek, 'They go up to œ24.95'. She stood silently for a
moment or two deep in thought, then she said, 'Have you anything
for around a tenner?'.

     A most proud mother walked into the shop one day and asked,
'Do you have a good chess game for the Spectrum 48? It must be
a pretty advanced one though, it's for my son and he's got an
'O' level in woodwork'.

     Many of the pre-Christmas comments we heard were simply
hilarious, such as ...

     (A father)  'Do you have a good cricket game? My lad's got
one already but his highest team score is only 16. He thinks
there's a bug in the game but I think it's just that he's crap'.

     (Another father)  'I want a couple of games for my two
lads, but nothing too violent though. You see every time they
play one of those 'punch-em-ups' together the oldest lad always
loses and then commences to knock all shades of s - - t out of
his little brother'.

     (A mother)  'Do you have a C64 program which teaches you
how to knit properly? It's for my daughter - she keeps dropping
one every now and then and occasionally she gets stuck when
trying to get knotted'.

     (A most 'plain-speaking' young father)  'I want a good
sports game for my kid .. but not 'Daley Thompson's Decathlon'
though. He's f - - - - d up two joysticks already with all that
bleeding 'left-right, left-right' and now he's knackering up
his keyboard with all that sodding 'A-S  A-S, O-P O-P'!!'.

     A man standing scratching his head in bewilderment after
having stood for some ten minutes with screwed up eyes as he
studied the rows of boxed games around the walls of the shop ..
'Excuse me, I've forgotten my glasses. Do you actually have any
house plant compost amongst that lot?'.

     (A man)  'It's no use you trying to explain technicalities
to me .. all I know about my lad's Atari is that he says it
already has 512 kilograms in it and he wants to up it to 1024
kilograms so that he can play those 1 megaton games'.

     (A typical dad)  'I've no option but to buy my lad a new
Spectrum 'cos the last time I plugged in his old one there was
this bloody great bang, the dog almost s - - t itself and we
haven't seen the cat since!'.

     (Another typical dad)   'I don't know why the hell he
keeps going on about wanting new games .. he got two free games
with his computer last Christmas and he hardly plays them now'.

     (A mother)  'I made a great mistake last Christmas, I got
him one of those text adventures. It proved to be a bitter
disappointment to him .. he's dyslexic you see'.

     (Another mum)  'My son's lucky really - he's ambidextrous
so it doesn't matter what sort of joystick I get for him'.

     (A wife)  ' He's sick and tired of waiting for it to slowly
unwind .. He just wants to pop it in quickly and get on with the
job'. (She was explaining why her husband wanted to change from a
tape loading machine to a disk loading one!).

     A mother walked into our shop with her son who was aged
around ten. 'He's got an Amiga', she said, 'He's brought me in to
show me a particular game he wants'. 'Which game is it?', I asked.
'W.W.F.', the boy replied. The large box game 'World Wrestling
Federation' having been duly inspected and paid for, it was then
wrapped and handed to the mother. 'Can I carry it Mum?', the boy
asked excitedly. 'No you can't!', the mother snapped, 'You know
its one of your surprise Christmas presents!'.

     Another young boy was one day studying the box games on
display with his mum when suddenly he pointed up to the big
busted, scantily clad girls on the front of a strip poker game.
'Look at that Mum!', he shouted. His mother smiled around the
crowded shop demurely. 'You're certainly not getting THAT for
Christmas!', she said with an embarrased laugh. 'I don't need
it', her young son replied, 'Dad's already got it'.

     (Man to young son)  'How many more flaming times have I to
tell you?? You can't have an Amiga for Christmas! You know that
Uncle Eric's letting you have his Dragon - you'll get no more
fun out of an Amiga than you will from that!'.

     (Similar kind of dad)  'You must be joking! I'm not paying
œ400 for a computer .. I didn't pay that bloody much for our
Ford Capri'.

     Some of the questions which were asked around Christmas
time by those new to computing brought a smile to all our
faces. Questions such as ...

     'Will it affect the Christmas tree lights?'.

     'If you unplug it can you be sure it's off?'.

     'If I wipe it over regularly with surgical spirit or some-
      thing like that it should kill off any of those viruses
      you hear about shouldn't it?'.

     'Which art package could you recommend for my friend who is
      colour blind?' (to which, to my horror, my youngest shop
      assistant said, 'It depends .. does he have a colour
      monitor?).

     (After buying an STFM) .. 'Do you supply batteries with it?'.

     ( .... ditto ....    ) .. 'Can you wrap it so that it won't
                                break if I drop it outside?'.

     (After buying a second Atari disk drive) .. 'Can I use it
                                with my old Spectrum when its not
                                in use with the Atari?'.

     'Do they come with repair kits?' (meaning computers).

     'Can you actually see these viruses or are they too small?'.

     'Do you only put one disk in at a time?'.

     'How can a square disk go around in the computer?'.

     'It's surprising isn't it? These floppy disks are quite
      hard when you actually hold one'.

     'How do you turn the disk over when its inside to play the
      other side?'.

     'How can you tell how much of a disk is used? I mean you
      can't tell just by looking at one can you?'.

     'How do you know if a game is too big to fit your computer?
      I mean there are all those different sizes of games on the
      wall there .. some in big boxes and others in small plastic
      cases ...'.

     'Will they plug into any socket?'.

     'Do they work better if they are pointing in a certain
      direction?'.

     'You know you said that you can plug them into any TV ...
      can they pick up all the different channels?'.

     'Will my current TV licence cover it?'.

     'I suppose its safer to have both your feet firmly planted
      on a rubber mat isn't it?'.

     'There's no danger of it coming alive of its own accord
      is there?'.

And other types of questions and comments gave us a good chuckle
too, for instance ...

     'You see that game in your window, 'It Came From the Desert'?'.
     'Yes?'.
     'What did?'.

     'Would you have a good sea warfare game for my son?'.
     'What about 'Nautilus'? It's a submarine game'.
     'Oh, I'm not too sure about that one .. you see he's
      claustrophobic'.

     'My lad has asked for a second disk drive for Christmas, but
      I've told him I think it would be an utter and complete
      waste of money .. after all, you can only play one game at
      a time can't you?'.

     'I've had a Vic 20 for years now and I must have well over a
      hundred games for it. If I buy an Atari from you it shouldn't
      take me too long to convert them should it?'.

     'Do you stock a good typing program that automatically
      corrects spelling mistakes on a QRETWY keyboard?'. (that is
      exactly what the man said - Del).

     'My lad wants to know if you have another flight simulator,
      but he says this time can you let him have one where the
      plane doesn't keep blowing up every time he tries to take
      off'.

     'That game on display in your window, 'Railroad Tycoon'.
     'Yes?'.
     'Is it a platform game?'.

     A Commodore C64 owner .. 'Do you think I will be able to
      get 'Elvira' on a five and a quarter inch?'.

     'Have you got 'Condom the Destroyer'?'.

     'I play these games with my son but I've a bit of a problem
      with 'Dragon's Lair'.
     'Are you finding it hard getting through the Castle?'.
     'Castle! I haven't got across the drawbridge yet ... Do you
      think I'd do any better with 'Dungeon Master'?'.

     'I like those war strategy games but quite frequently
      things get so complicated that I forget whose side I
      started out on'.

     'That game 'Populous' ... in my case they should have
      called it 'Atlantis' - every time I build a village or
      anything I manage to flood it!'.

     'Did they ever bring out a game called 'The Invisible Man?'.
      Only I can't see him on your shelves'.

     'How can I be sure that there is nothing phonographic in
      in these games?'.

     'Listen .. I lose track of the plot of 'Humpty Dumpty' so
      its not much use showing me a computer manual is it?'.

     'Can you help me choose a game? I suppose you've played
      all of them yourself haven't you?'.

     'Yes, the Atari grey is quite pleasing but you wouldn't
      have one in pale green to match his bedroom would you?
      Mind you, I suppose my husband could always paint it'.

     'How come these ST games I bought for my son won't run on
      his Amiga? It baffles me .. they are the same size as the
      ones he got with his computer'.

     'I sometimes wish I'd have got a five and a quarter inch
      disk drive now .. just look how much more game you must
      get on those five and a quarter inch disks!'.

     'Why is a mouse always included with computers such as the
      Amiga and the Atari? Don't additional items like that
      knock up the price? I've managed for years with my old
      Electron without a mouse, in fact I've never felt the
      need for one'.

     'You will have to explain that to me again ..... The Atari
      520 there has what you said was a one meg disk drive and
      the 1040 there also has a one meg disk drive ... okay?
      Then surely both computers must be able to take a one
      meg game as you call it ... it seems perfectly obvious to
      me! Or am I missing something?'.

     (From a typical 'Johnny-know-all' who in reality  knows
     sod all!) 'Now come on, be honest. There isn't really all
     that much difference between that Spectrum 128 there and
     that Atari ST is there? It's all in the presentation of
     the case isn't it .. you know, the old catch-penny
     illlusion that bigger is better!'.

      Oh dearie, dearie me ........!

     A man had been standing quietly at the counter for some ten
minutes on a busy day prior to Christmas glumly gazing at the
games behind it up on the rear wall. 'Hello!', I said brightly as
I got around to serving him, 'Need any help?'. 'I'm just 
contemplating whether or not to get one', he said, his voice as
glum as his gaze, 'they're not as good as they look are they?'.
He sighed as he turned away, saying 'I got 'The Untouchables'
last week and it wasn't anywhere near as good as the film'.

     Sometimes, though, the laugh wasn't on the customer, but on
US, the staff. For example ...

     There was the time when a nice lady came into the shop and
said, 'I want a couple of good games as Christmas presents,
nothing too difficult though. He hasn't had his computer very
long and for instance he's unable to get into 'Ollie and Lisa'
or 'School Daze' which I got from you last week'.
     'Well now,', I said, 'Let's see .. How old is the little boy?'.
     'Thirty-nine', replied the lady, 'He's my husband!'.

     Another lady asked, 'Have you anything on origami?'.
     (My young assistant - again!) 'I don't think so .. we have
things like 'Tae Kwondo', 'Last Ninja', 'Panza Kick Boxing' and
'Street Fighter' though'.

     This same helper once remarked quite innocently to a
gentleman who had asked which flight programs we had in stock,
'Looking for a good stimulator then are we Sir?'.

     Actually, this particular young assistant was very adept
at getting things wrong. I recall the time that a rather
severe looking school master, his bi-focals perched on the end
of his nose, came into the shop and said to him, 'I teach 
Natural Studies, do you have anything on animal behavioural
patterns?'. The young assistant glanced about the display
walls and replied thoughtfully, 'Well ... we've got 'A Rock Star
Ate My Hamster', 'Howard the Duck', 'Mighty Mouse', 'Huckle-
berry Hound' .....'. (I stopped him right there!).

     But this lad could be quite witty when he wanted to be.
Such as on the day that a middle-aged man approached him at the
counter and said, 'I am a clairvoyant .. do you have anything
on psychic phenomena?'. He replied, 'You tell me!'.

     And then there was the occasion on an afternoon before
Christmas day when a young man and woman walked in together, both
obviously having been to their works or office Christmas party
and both of them more than a little 'under the influence'. The
young man said to my youthful assistant, 'Have you a good Amstrad
128 soccer game?'. Before my lad could reply, the girl, who was
well and truly 'going' and looking a bit dishevelled, giggled
and struggled somewhat to focus her gaze on him, 'And ....',
she slurred as she propped herself up against the counter,
'... have you anything that will make me radiantly beautiful..?'.
Another giggle or two and then there was a short but, to me,
rather ominous silence before the lad replied, 'Madam .. I am but
a humble computer shop assistant. The only man who might be able
to make you look radiantly beautiful celebrates his one thousand,
nine hundred and ninetieth birthday tomorrow ..!'.

     When the couple had finally left the shop, he turned to me
and said, 'I bet he calls her 'Treasure'. I said, 'Why do you
say that?'. 'Well its obvious ..', came his reply, 'Wherever he
takes her people must say 'Where the hell did he dig her up!''.
He then added, as an afterthought, 'Or perhaps its on account of
her sunken chest'.

     Maybe in a later article I will tell you more of this guy,
plus other anecdotes regarding the zany antics and sayings of
other members of my staff (Staff! Now there's a laugh!) I had
over the years. Let me know if you would like to hear of these,
they would certainly warrant an article (or two) devoted only
to themselves (for example, one male member of staff was looking
out through the shop window one day when a very long funeral
cortege drove slowly past. 'I wonder whose dead?', asked a lady
in the shop. 'It'll be the guy in the box in the first car', came
the reply. 'Actually', informed another lady customer, 'it's
Mr. so-and-so'. 'Oh, dear', said the first lady, 'Has he died
then?'. 'If he hasn't', muttered the assistant, ' someone is
playing one hell of a dirty trick on him!').

     But back to the customers .....

     I have purposely left one of my favourite stories about the
time I ran our family computer shop until the end of this article.

     One 24th December it  was particularly busy in the shop as
we behind the counter strove to ensure that customers were not
kept waiting any longer than necessary. At our busiest period
during the mid-afternoon a rather arrogant young man walked in
and shouted from behind the grouped customers, 'Have you got
'Monopoly'?'.
     'No, sorry', I shouted back to him above the clamour.
Thirty seconds later the young man's voice called out even more
strongly, 'Have you got 'Monopoly'?.
     'No ..', I shouted back, ' .. sorry!',
     Barely twenty seconds later he called out again even more
loudly, 'Have you got 'Monopoly'?'. He bellowed out the question
two or three times more over the following few minutes, drawing
some attention to himself.
     Standing at our counter during the time was one of our most
regular Atari lads, a real joker about eighteen. Slowly he
turned towards the guy who by now everyone in the shop knew
wanted 'Monopoly'.
     'Excuse me pal', he said to the loudmouth, 'Are you any
good at spelling?'.
     'Yes', the guy replied, 'Not bad, why?'.
     'Well', said our joker with everyone listening by now,
'How many 'f's are there in 'fulfil'?'.
     'Two', came the big guy's reply.
     'How many 'f's are there in 'daffodil?'. asked our
questioner.
     'Two again!', came the answer from the guy who now seemed
to be thoroughly enjoying showing off his skill in spelling.
     'And how many 'f's are there in 'Monopoly'?', continued our
joker.
     'There is no 'f' in 'Monopoly'', came the confident reply
from the big mouth.
     'Well that's what the man has been trying to tell you for
the past five bloody minutes!', retorted our joker.

     The entire shop simply fell about with laughter .. and the
big guy made a hasty exit!

     Well, that's about the end of it for this issue of 'Maggie',
but I look forward to catching you again in '96.

     Till then, take care you all .....

                     Very best wishes for the festive season .....

P.S. A particular seasonal greeting to Richard (Felice) of
     'Maggie' and to Mark (MSD) of 'Persistence of Vision' for
     their help, support and continuing contact with me during
     '95. Also to Richard Karsmakers for his kind remarks about
     my 'Maggie' articles and for including one of these in his
     long-running and excellent 'ST News' disk magazine. Keep
     up the good work Richard!
