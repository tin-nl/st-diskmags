                    By Tony Greenwood (STOSSER Software)

 
    I probably looked a fool staring at the screen with a somewhat blank 
expression  on  my face, having just installed my newly  acquired  99.00 
14/400 fax/modem from Ladbrokes Computing in Preston,  the assistant had 
assured  me  that I could simply "plug in and connect to the  net"  with 
this Modem and Software, and my trusty one meg STFM,

   Three disks of "comms" software and the Modem manual,  the latter  of 
which  pertained  to the actual setting up and not  general  usage,  the 
first  two  disks of software would not only bomb out on  attempting  to 
run,  but  as is so often the case with serious Atari software  the  doc 
files are in German, nothing against German software but I never did get 
around  to  learning  their language,  as the software  was  chosen  by
Ladbrokes  and not the Modem makers ( who hail from Taiwan ) then I  was 
doubly suprised that they had presumed I would be able to read German,

  The one remaining disk I am later to find out is the only one I really 
needed  and the  other two were for the Fax facilities to which  I  have 
yet to have the dubious pleasure. 
 
  A comms package called CoNnect that is not only shareware?  and one of 
the best Communications packages around, but also widely regarded as one 
of the most difficult to get to grips with and definitely not for novices 
or  a "newbie" as I was later to be labelled,  So for 99ukp I get two as 
good as useless disks and a Shareware, difficult to master Comms  package 
that  will  cost me 29.99ukp to register,  needless to say,  I  was  not 
impressed,

   I  telephoned  the one person I knew to  own  a  Modem,  being  fully 
conversant with CoNnect he was able to guide me through those first  few 
steps,  not yet having Internet access such as an account with Demon  or 
Compulink or similar,  I was limited to the BBS network, my friend took 
me far enough to be able to actually dial a BBS (Bulletin Board System), 

   My version of CoNnect had a bank of BBS numbers built in all ready to 
dial,  the  names of  BBS's to this day do not give any clue as  to  the 
type  of machine they support,  there are very few clues in the name  to 
suggest Atari, All the BBS numbers in my version of CoNnect were out of 
date  and  not one of those BBS's actually existed,  So I am  still  sat 
here  connected to nothing,  Ladbrokes were now well and truly off  my 
Christmas card list,

    After  rummaging through various back issues of ST  Format  I  found 
references to some BBS systems,Desktop, a top Atari BBS, Ad-Lib not only 
an  Atari  specific BBS but run by two ST  Format  people,  namely  Andy 
Curtis  as the main man and Frank Charlton as his not so little  helper, 
plus heavily supported by the magazine with facilities to actually  talk 
to anyone from STF,Unfortunately these and many others I found references 
to were not within my local area and therefore to phone them during the 
day  would cost me a staggering 8.32p per minute as opposed to 3.36p  if 
they had been a local call.However I was sat here with my brand spanking 
new Modem and no way was I about to wait until 6 o'clock when the  price 
dropped to 4.94p for those calls and a more manageable 1.4p for local, so 
dial away I did,  it seems most BBS's only allow one caller to be on the 
BBS at any given time,  hence time limits when you do get through, these 
can  be  quite generous  and you can buy more time by  simply  uploading 
some software, there are limits as to how much software you can download 
but  again  these can be increased by  again  uploading  software,  your 
biggest  problem  will  be  finding  software that a BBS usually with at 
least a one  Gigabyte  hardrive  and maybe even a couple  of CD's hasn't  
already got, it  checks  your  upload against  existing  software before 
crediting you for the upload,this inevitably leads to some jokers simply 
renaming  software  to  "cheat",  thus causing the  rest  problems  when 
downloading the said programs, 

  Don't let me put you off,there are vast amounts of software on all BBS 
systems  and  if there is a ratio its usually at least 10/1 so  you only 
need to upload one item to be allowed ten downloads,  weekends at  local 
rates are a very healthy 0.85p per minute and 2.8p everywhere  else,  so 
downloading a half meg program for 6-7minutes will work out at less than 
30 pence and you have it instantly,

 But files are not the only side to a BBS,  there are the message areas, 
in my opinion this is what Comms are all about,  "Communication",  I use 
Ad-Lib BBS and can enter messages on their system that will be  answered 
from America or Sweden or wherever within a couple of days, but messages 
is too weak a word,  whole conversations and debates are going  on,  not 
between two people but between many people, let me explain...

 Each BBS has its own set of message areas,  some I have visited have up 
to four hundred (400) different areas, others a mere 50 or so, but there 
are sets of message areas called "echos",  placing a message in an  echo 
can be read by anyone from any country who's BBS also takes that echo, ST 
Format and Atari World have their own echos and as such the writers from 
the respective magazines are there to join in conversations with  anyone 
who  wants to join in,  the jist is that anyone can read everyone  elses 
messages and simply join in,  its great fun,  you get all the news about 
everything  first,  a notice was recently posted by Atari World  stating 
there would be two Atari shows before christmas, they gave the dates and 
the  cities to host the  events,  full details were to be  announced  in 
issue  7  of Atari World in another 4 weeks time,  so the  Modem  owning 
public are a month up on everyone else, 

   BBS  users and owners are just as friendly as any other  Atari  user, 
once onto the BBS's all I had to do was ask for help by simply typing it 
into  a message,  by the weekend I knew a little about using the  modem, 
logging onto "One to One" BBS and the Sysop ( System Operator ) spent  a 
couple  of hours explaining everything to me,  this was done by us  both 
taking  turns typing to each other,  so I would type a question  and  he 
would type the answer, by the early morning I knew quite a bit,from then 
on I simply asked questions in the message areas and got an  average  of 
six answers for each question, 

  If you are thinking of getting a modem then my advice is do so,  it  is 
not  as expensive as people make it,  it is up to yourself how  expensive 
you  make it, arm yourself with some knowledge before buying  the  modem, 
contact your loacal PDL and get as many files as you can regarding comms, 
there  are  FAQ's (Frequently Asked Questions) and beginners  guides  all 
available to help you out,  get them and read them first and it will save 
you  money  trying  to find these things out  "on  line",  once  you  are 
connected all you have to do is ask and you will be deludged with  people 
wanting to help you, 

 Happy comms :-)
