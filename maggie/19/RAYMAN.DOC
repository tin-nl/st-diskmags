A somewhat French and brilliantly Truecolour platformer for the Jag..

I first set eyes on this some time  ago  as long ago as the Spring '94
ECTS where an early level demo was  in  play.. In due course, this has
matured into the full game, released  in  the latter part of 1995, and
now finally come into our  hands..  Felice  kindly provided the review
copy, and instead of writing  this  himself,  he  has taken off to the
Canary Isles over Xmas, and left it for me to do instead..

To add to the confusion,  my  Falcon  remains  firmly at Maggie GHQ in
Rushden whilst I spend the Xmas  break in Northampton chez les parents
and avec le Jaguar, and  the  only  available  machine to tap out this
review happens to be their PC,  running  Word  for Windows.. So yes, I
have sold out,  albeit temporarily, to the evil one known only as Bill
Gates.. Don't worry, I'll try not to let it happen again!!

The game itself?

Well we are told, in Rayman's  world,  nature and people live together
in peace.. The Great Protoon  provides  and  maintains the harmony and
balance in the world.. Sorry  folks,  this apparently can't last.. (Do
you want to play or what?)

One fateful day, the  Great  Protoon  is  stolen  by  Mr Dark, an evil
being! (no, really?! - Ed) The  Electoons who used to gravitate around
it lose their  natural  stability  and  scatter  all  over  the world!
Troublesome isn't it? And untidy too!

In this now unbalanced world, strange phenomena begin to occur, freaks
and hostile characters appear, capturing every Electoon they can find!
They definitely need a HERO to save them now, don't you think?

Rayman must recapture the Great Protoon from its mysterious kidnapper,
free the Electoons and  reassemble  them  all  to  restore the World's
harmony..

But will the bad guys let him  do  it? After all, he doesn't have arms
or legs, but don't panic, neither do the bad guys..

The plot suitably disposed of, proves  to  be  no better or worse than
the thousands of other ones  that  have  narrowly  failed to win Nobel
prizes for literature down the  years..  Maybe we should say something
about the game itself..

First  impressions  are  good,   the   startup  sequence  is  lavishly
illustrated, repeating the hastily  scribbled  plot  in pretty cartoon
form, a quick stab at a joypad  button  takes you onto the main game..
Lush 16-bit truecolour visuals  beat  at  the  eyeballs (65536 colours
onscreen), whilst bop-a-long easy listening platform style music sifts
into your ears.. The Rayman character is suitably large and cartoonish
in size and animation.. Many many frames  have  been used to make up a
sprite that walks, climbs,  swings  and  punches, and (slightly later)
can also grab at handholds,  and  use  his  ears in  a helicopter-like
motion for short bursts of flight..

The attention to  the  look  of  the  game  is  carried  over into the
background graphics, where as well as  the constantly mobile bad guys,
there are also loads of  little  extra  touches, dancing mushrooms and
other objects that bounce about,  even  when  they are not relevant to
the plot.. The cartoon  feel  is  kept  up  with  some  of the 'enemy'
sprites going gloriously over the top,  as one character fires bullets
at Rayman which then spawn  into a comedy mallet-wielding projectile..
And there are many  more  examples  of  this  sort of  exaggeration of
familiar platform conventions through the game..  There is also a nice
'backdrop' which sort of parallax  scrolls  with  the game as you move
about..

After doing two or three levels,   you  could be forgiven for thinking
that you are making  substantive  progress  through  the game, a quick
glance at the booklet, and in my  case, a quick look at the previously
saved games option screen reveals the size of the task before you.. My
copy was a previously used game,  where the previous owner had managed
to complete the whole  thing..  Up  to  five  separate game worlds are
there, all of them need completing before the final confrontation with
Mr Dark himself,and all  of  them  with  a  unique  range of different
hazards which will sternly test  even the more experienced platformers
among you..

1. Dream Forest, the  place  where  it  all  starts, and where initial
impressions of the game stem from..  This starts easily enough, as you
are led gently into the game, only getting the ability to punch by the
third level.. Rayman has to proceed  through  a jungly scene, work out
how to get across vast stretches  of  marsh-water, and punch the waves
of mad explorers sent to stop him..  Use of creeper vines and floating
giant plums to get across  the  water  is recommended.. Slightly later
worlds have you swinging from  platform  to  platform.. One world even
'borrows' from Rainbow Islands  by  having  Rayman climb vertically to
avoid the constantly rising water.. The  end  of level boss is a giant
mosquito who is not very  nice  at  all..  Starts off easily, but gets
harder.. Earlier levels repay visiting  for hidden extras, once Rayman
has gained his extra powers..

(For the rest, I was  able  to  'browse' the different levels, without
getting too far, thanks to the unknown  person who had played it right
through..)

2. Band land, a platform level reminiscent  of parts of 'Zool', as you
dodge  through  clouds  and   avoid   bum  notes..  Difficulty  level,
moderate.. Lots of crawling needed to get under some obstructions..

3. Blue mountains, a  rocky  and  oppressively  gloomy scene this one,
clamber through caverns, up  and  down  crevasses, avoid sharp spikes,
and some real motherf*cker stone guardians that take ages to kill, but
can do away with you in  no  time  at  all.. One sub-level gives you a
full helicopter flight capability, but it  is quite tough to avoid the
jagged puncturing rocks that send you to your doom..

4. Picture City, the world of  images  and the world of mirages, can't
really remember too much  about  this  one,  similar  to  Band land in
places, I think.. There were  some  levels  which were themed around a
stationary cupboard stuffed  with  office  equipment,  climb on pencil
platforms, bounce on  giant  erasers/rubbers  to  get  to  the desired
place, and so on.. Very strange..

5. The Cave of Skops, another  gloomy  and craggy level.. On this one,
your swinging,  clambering and  holding  onto  narrow ledge skills are
sorely tested indeed..

Finally, if you manage to  complete  the  five worlds, you get pitched
headfirst into Candy Chateau, the world  of desserts where you finally
come up against the evil clowns guarding  Mr Dark, and Mr Dark himself
(if you are any good, which  I'm  not!) This world is very reminiscent
of some levels of 'Zool'..

With such a long haul, a 'save  game'  feature is very useful to have,
also ingame, a character called the  photographer appears from time to
time to record where you have got to, and thus provide a restart point
if anything 'unfortunate' should happen to Rayman afterwards..

Borrowing heavily from  other  parts  of  platform  game heritage, you
won't be too surprised to find hundreds of shiny baubles or 'tings' to
pick up around the levels.. These duplicate Sonic the Hedgehogs energy
rings, and the 'Tings' are useful  for  providing extra lives (after a
hundred are picked up), bartering for  'save-games', or to gain access
to hidden bonus levels..

Anyway, time to sum it up, we think.

Ratings:-

Graphics:- 90% - Some of the best for a Jaguar game so far, lavish use
of extra animation brings a touch of class to the game, a wide variety
of material, and conscious  attempts  to  please  with  large doses of
cartoon humour..  Definitely  one  to  watch  whilst  someone  else is
playing..

Sonics:- 80% -  Undemanding  music  for  the  different levels, nicely
executed samples for the game itself, what more could you want..

Playability:- 92% - Very, a game which  is  easy to get into, but will
demand a full range of skills  from  you  as you progress.. One really
for determined platform players..

Overall:-  89% - I'm not  quite  sure  if  this  is a classic or not..
Certainly a superior game, and  one  actually  worthy  of the Jag in a
desperately thin field at the moment, but  it does not quite have that
'grab' factor of a truly addictive game.. Personal tastes vary though,
and we are really into the realms of the subjective here..

If you like platform games, and are prepared to spend some time to get
the best out of it, then definitely get it!!
