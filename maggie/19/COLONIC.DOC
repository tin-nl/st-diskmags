                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                          BY THE SENIOR DADS


Perhaps if there was  one  jaw-dropping, technically stunning, aurally
astounding, genre-defining demo released in 1995 it was "Anal Tuck" by
The Senior Dads. It was a demo that took the Fried Bits III convention
by storm, tossing away all the  traditional conventions of demo coding
and replacing them with line a  calls.  It was breathtaking - the Dads
had changed the face of demo coding  with  a single call to the Gemdos
print line routine.

The work of Nonce and Jessie  will  go  down  in the anals of history.
There were those who said it  couldn't be bettered, that sequels would
be pointless - how can you  improve  on perfection? But once again the
Senior Dads have confounded the  critics  by  releasing a demo of such
quality, such ambition that people have been driven to worship it.

Over the last couple of years demo effects have become more realistic.
Natural phenomena  like   fire   and   smoke   have   been   emulated.
Flatshaded polygons have been  replaced  with   better lighting models
such as Gouraud &   Phong   shading.   Texture   Mapping  has  created
life  like environments. But  one  elements  of  nature  has  remained
relatively anonymous - water.

The Senior Dads are experts at  passing water and quickly realised its
potential. But they also had the temerity to take a non standard water
situation -  that  of  irrigation  -  and  give  it  the  true  colour
treatment.

You can almost hear the DSP straining under the weight of the parallel
instructions as it creates the  irrigation  model.  Look at the screen
and you will not believe the  sight  in  front of your eyes. They also
manage to scroll messages up the  screen (using the 68030 in parallel)
and decided to use GEMDOS calls for the scroller so the demo would run
on the forthcoming Microbox.

The music is recorded with a new technique "phase 4 stereo" and really
sounds like it is coming straight out of the speakers! Outstanding.

The demo ends with the standard  end scroller that has become somewhat
of a cliche, but the Dads  push  this  into  a new dimension by adding
insights into their world  and  messages  to  friends and enemies. The
senior dads don't seem to rate  EKO's  3D  world system very highly as
they have created their own 3D  world  system using line A calls which
will be compatible with all past and future ataris. Smart move.

The other amazing fact about this demo  is that they managed to fit it
into 69K (another ironic art statement). Their coding is compact as it
is creative.

So another winner from the Dads, and  they promise us more. How can we
refuse to submit to their bid for world domination?
