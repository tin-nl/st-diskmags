             NEWS: ABOUT THE FORTHCOMING ISSUE EIGHT

                     (Keeping you informed)


Despite a rumour (from an unmentioned source :) ),  claiming that 
there isn't to be another issue, Issue 8 is well underway, with a 
good  many of the articles already completed.  I think  the  mis-
understanding may have come from the issue seven editorial  where 
I  said that issue could possibly delayed due to  my  schoolwork. 
That  does NOT mean that schoolwork has caused me to stop  making 
Skynet Times!

So,  what wonders can be expected from issue eight?? Well, things 
are just being reported on and review as they appear, so we can't 
really be sure what will happen between now and the release date. 
Here's what stuff is set in stone (maybe?!) so far:-

   * News, not done yet - will be done closer to release date
 * Reviews of the latest issues of diskzines, inc ST News, AEO..
       * Reviews of recent issues of Atari World magazine
               * THE guide to World Wide Web sites
               * Atari World Christmas show report
                         * Music reviews
        * An interview with Colin Fisher-McAllum of 42BBS
          * Maybe an interview with someone else (???)
                       * 'Quotes of 1995'
       * The usual PDL adverts plus full FOG PDL catalogue
        * Hopefully more Falcon specific reading material
              * Another 'In short..' reviews column
         * Plus anything else that springs up for review
         * ..and much more??  (Rettorical question :) )

The release date is as usual very uncertain. Before Easter is all 
I'm  saying right now,  so that gives you an excuse to send  hate 
mail when it isn't out by then!

Hold your horses - It wil come...


          Your editor,  

                    Jon Nott (aka Vogue)
