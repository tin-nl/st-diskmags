
     THE MAGGIE 18TH ISSUE/FIFTH BIRTHDAY PARTY: THE REPORT

          (Random Scrawlings related to the subject...)

The  Maggie  party  went off with a bang at CIH's  home  town  of 
Rushden,  if maybe it didn't quite explode on the scale that some 
were expecting.. Let me explain..

'twas  four  thirthy in the afternoon on the sunny  old  18th  of 
August  when  myself and one RiCHard Davey set off on a  hot  and 
steamy National Express coach,  heading vaguely in the  direction 
of Northampton bus station.  The journey was to take almost  four 
hours as we took the long route,  stopping off at  Bath,  Swindon 
and Oxford,  amongst other places.  I suppose that way saves  the 
coach operators some money..  Anyway, we got a ten minute stop in 
Oxford so we had time to.. er, take a leak, and that was about it 
really.

Our  arrival at Northants saw us getting off of the coach to  end 
up  face to face with two evil looking characters known as  Chris 
Holland  and  Richard  Felice (nasty  experience  -  only  joking 
guys!). A quick traverse to Felice's car and before we knew it we 
were  hurtling around the dual carridgeways of the local area  at 
speeds of up to 30 mph!!  One small stop was made at the house of 
a guy called Nathan to pick up a couple of monitors and an  STE.. 
I  tell you,  navigating down a steep household staircase with  a 
large  SVGA in your hands is not a fun experience at the best  of 
times,  let alone when you have coach-lag!  CIH informed us  that 
Nathan was a martial arts expert, so we decided to be that extra 
bit careful when lobbing the expensive kit into the boot :)

Back  on  the dual carridgeway again and  Felice  was  overtaking 
(parked)  cars  like nobody's business.  Soon,  after  a  driving 
experience that can only be compared to a simulator on overdrive, 
we arrived at a ghost town they call Rushden, and into a deserted 
street they call North Street. Grabbing our various baggages from 
the car we entered a lonely looking block of flats (or complex  - 
as it wasn't like a tower block or anything). Opening the door of 
number  84 totally reversed the emptiness,  as in the  room  were 
a few strangers that we were quickly introduced to..  They turned 
out to be Leon O'Reilly of Reservoir Gods and his sister, also of 
the Reservoir Gods, Tasha (*)..

(*)  Rich  and I had a conversation earlier  about  weither  Tash 
would come. I asked Rich if he thought she would and he said 'Not 
if  she's got any sense!!'.  Understandably he was rather  gutted 
*understatement* when we walked into the room.  The  explanation 
to Leon and Tash resulted in various 'Beavis and Butt-head' style 
sniggers..

After the introductions were out of the way, CIH toodled off back 
to Northants to pick up Tat and Kev. Me, Rich, Leon and Tash were 
left  to familiarise ourselves with each other.  Leon  explained 
that  he was working on the bugs (!) in the Falcon Maggie  shell, 
and Tash was just sat on the sofa, mellowing out. Rich decided to 
raid the fridge and I unpacked the laptop and made a start on the 
realtime article..

Chris' return with Tat and Kev on board filled the room up a  bit 
as there were now eight of us in a room built for two or three at 
the  most.  Even more introductions went underway,  while  Felice 
typed  love  messages to some actress called  Meredith  into  the 
laptop.  This  Meredith  woman  became a common  feature  in  the 
article as time went on (erm)..

The rest  of  that evening was vastly  straight  forward  for  an 
'evening  before' kind of thing (the 'morning  after'  depressing 
bit comes towards the end...).  More work was put into the Maggie 
shell,  a  few  of Tat's 'EKO-beating' routines  were  looked  at 
(judder  judder - Hi Tat!).  These were only in the early  stages 
though.  I  took  the opportunity to browse though a  few  multi-
megabyte hard drives, skimming off all newish looking modules and 
pictures.  The  only useful (or not as the case may be) thing  we 
discovered  was  that  you  could fit  the  entire  48k  Spectrum 
'rubber-keys'  memory  into  the  1.5Gb  storage  we  had   there 
something like thirty thousand times (???).

Eventually sleep was gained by all at around 5am, yes, four hours 
before  the  party was supposed to start in the  hotel  down  the 
road!!

Those who had the intelligence to bring     suitable      slumber 
equipment  (ie  sleeping bag) had a luxury  doze.  Of  course,  I 
didn't think it would be a necessity, so I ended up with nothing 
between myself and the hard floor.  Nevertheless,  I slept like a 
log (who wouldn't when it gets to 5 am??)..

Early rise at eight was too much for many of us, and even after a 
morning coffee to top up the caffeine levels we still looked like 
an  army of stoned rodents.  Yet more strain was placed on us  by 
having to carry a shipment *yah* of computers,monitors and all the 
shite that goes with (disks,  leads et al) to CIH's car. With the 
car packed full of Atari Corp's industrial waste,  the rest of us 
were  given  no option but to walk *argh!* to the  hotel.  It was 
about  50  yards  away.  Much time would have been  saved  if  we 
actually  carried the gear all the way to the hotel,  instead  of 
bothering with the car. Maybe CIH wanted to gain some street cred 
around  his  home  town  by driving around with  a  car  full  of 
computers (?)..

First  impressions of the room CIH had aquired for us said  'Fuck 
this hole is titchy!',  but after a bit of furniture re-arranging 
and other forms of general vandalism (pardon?) we found there  to 
be  plenty of space to compute.  Due the non-arrival  of  certain 
people,  the room wasn't particularly packed anyway (more on non-
arrivals later!).  We each grabbed a table (one thing that  *was* 
in  short  supply)  and set about lumbering  them  with  STs  and 
Falcons.  As  all  the  Falcons had already  been  encaptured  by 
certain  people  (their owners in most cases),  I settled  for  a 
1040STe  and the laptop on my table.  Once set up I ran a few  of 
the   classic  demos  to  entertain  whilst  everyone  else   was 
connecting various SCSI devices..

The morning took a while to get going really. The first couple of 
hours  were spent with Leon doing more work on the Maggie  shell, 
while other resorted to pissing around with all sorts of  things. 
I took the opportunity to test out the Skynet Times shell on  the 
STe - no problemos :-)

The  first change in tune of the day came when two  guys  (called 
Dave 'n Mark - I think!) arrived with STE's in hand, and set up a 
Substation midi-link-up thing.  Various midi leads trailed across 
the room as everyone tried out their man slaughter skills -  mine 
needing  a bit of oil.  I didn't survive long!!  I never was  any 
good at Doom either.  Later they were into STE Midi-Maze, but no-
one else except them had a play on that.  By then Kev and Tat had 
decided  on a 'Team' league. I faired a bit better at this  footy 
sim,  although I didn't win a single match.It was fun though, and 
I gave Ripley's joystick a good beating..

Whilst all this was going (and in betweem Team  matches),  myself 
and  CIH were adding the finishing touches to the ST  version  of 
Maggie 18.  We were having great difficulty with the  DESKTOP.INF 
file  as the STe we were using had TOS 1.60,  so didn't  want  to 
save it in medium resolution.  I got the old text editor out  but 
couldn't remember for the life of me what part you have to change 
for the resolution.  Instead of playing an infinite guessing game 
until we got it right,  we temperarily swapped the STe for  CIH's 
elderly  STfm,  just to do 'save desktop'  again!!  Tedious  work 
this!

I then had to occupy myself while I ZIPped Maggie 18 up, for easy 
copying.  It was around lunchtime anyway, so a few us took a trip 
along  the road to Kwik Save.  Talk about wasting money!  I  came 
back with three packets of Jammie Dodgers (on special offer  mind 
you),  lots of Pringles,  2 litres of Irn Bru,  and various other 
things.  Anyone  would have thought we were going on  a  survival 
weekend the amount of stuff we had.

For  lunch I had about 1 packet of Jammie Dodgers.  Most  of  the 
other stuff I left with CIH when I left the next day. The arrival 
of  ST  News' Mike Noyce gave a few fresh things to  do.  He  was 
interested in the new Maggie,  and indeed spent a vast amount  of 
time  reading  it.  He  also did quite a lot  in  the  real  time 
article,  which  was good seeing as the novelty had worn off  for 
most of us by that time.

Later in the afternoon, two other friends of CIH arrived with his 
new  CD-Rom drive.  After trying (for a wee while) to get  it  to 
work with ExtenDOS, we were able to look through the included CD-
Roms.   Many   of  them  were  your  usual  German   PD/Shareware 
compilations and the like.  One,  entitled 'Hot Licks',  provided 
some  alternative  entertainment for the  males  there.  The  few 
graphists  we  had there were more interested in  the  hand-drawn 
stuff  for its artistic quality.  Others wanted to see  the  true 
colour photographic stuff ;-}

Lots of us delved in to copy some stuff from the CD's (Ooo Arr!), 
but other seemed more interested in 'Stardust',  which was  being 
frantically played over on the STe.  I don't anyone actually  ate 
substantially at the usual 'Tea-time',  although a good few pints 
of Cidery and Beery stuff were being downed by many.

People began to leave at around 8-9 o'clock and the remainder  of 
us dived onto Felice's Falcon while he was taking someone home to 
digitise some pictures of various innocent looking  people.  Just 
about everyone got snapped. You'll just have to see some of them. 
Especially Leon's and Kev's - they're classics! After that it was 
just a case of packing away all the gear. James Mathews was still 
in Taunton as he had been all day.  Poor him!  He missed a  great 
party  (there could have been a few more people make  the  effort 
to turn up though!).  The same people that were at CIH's flat the 
night before returned again for the final night.  Some guy called 
Gareth and Mike Noyce also joined us. We were going to leave most 
of  the  computers at the hotel,  but the room didn't  look  that 
secure so we carried the whole lot back again.

The  first  'event'  of the evening was  CIH's  Phillips  monitor 
blowing  up  (not literally,  thank  heavens!).  It  was  quickly 
replaced with our borrowed SVGA.  Richard Karsmakers then  phoned 
to check what was going on.  Pity he couldn't have attended.  The 
phone was passed around the room so various people would chat  to 
him..   The Falcon version of Maggie was finished at about two in 
the  morning,  so another mass copying session  took  place.  The 
realtime  article was rounded up around that  time  as well, just 
before everyone got some kip. Another night on the hard floor for 
me!!

My alarm went off at seven thirty, waking just about everyone up. 
It  had to though,  as Rich and I had to catch our coach  in  the 
town centre at 8.55am.  Gareth also came to Northants bus station 
to catch his bus. Rich took his address at the station to arrange 
pressing all his Pompey menus onto a CD-Rom (!).  After  boarding 
the  coach  we were approached by a shabby  looking  student  who 
asked  'Are you computer buffs?'.  I think the laptop  in  Rich's 
hand  gave it away!  This at least gave us someone to chat to  on 
the coach.  He was a PC freak (surprise surprise!).  When he  got 
off  I  set  about reading the realtime  article  from  start  to 
finish.  That consumed a good part of the journey.  Sleeping  was 
also  a  favoured activity.  A few hours later we  arrived  home. 
Quite simple really......................................

fellow disk magazines so more people get a chance to read it (and 
get an idea of what the party was like!).
