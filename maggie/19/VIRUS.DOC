

         Virus's that failed to get into the UVK manual..

                        (See why!)

The Ultimate Virus Killer is an invaluable aid to dealing with the 
many notorious virii that have been given life on the ST.. All the 
nastiest  and  most common ones,  and many fascinating and  little 
known  ones  can  be  found  by  this  program..  However  Richard 
Karsmakers had to draw the line somewhere and here are some of the 
many useless attempts at virus programming that were rejected  out 
of  hand for inclusion in UVK..  All will become clear as you read 
on..

The 'Lady Di' Virus, aka 'A Woman Scorned Virus'..
This  Parasitic  format is thought to originate  from  Althorp  in 
Northamptonshire..  It initially had a very wide spread,  indeed a 
worldwide infection rate,  but was let down by the second stage of 
the  program,  which  was a tendency to sit in the corner  of  the 
bootsector sulking a lot, indulging in fits of expensive clothing, 
and  blaming  everyone  else for  its  wealthy,  priviledged,  but 
abysmal  lifestyle  ultimately going nowhere..  Still has  massive 
infective  potential  for other magnetic media apart  from  floppy 
disk,  as  it seems to favour videotape and live broacasts on  BBC 
television rather a lot..

The  'Sad  Dad'  Virus,  aka 'Colin in the  chunky  knit  cardigan 
Virus'..
Developed by a middle-aged renegade user group in Derbyshire, this 
virus  was intended to have lethal potential across the  range  of 
hardware   commonly   seen   at   these   sort   of   gatherings.. 
Unfortunately,  there is little call for a virus that attacks CP/M 
based systems,  especially those running on a Zilog Z80 CPU,  with 
an upper RAM limit of 64k, a green screen text only display, and a 
couple  of  those really big and clunky five and  a  quarter  inch 
floppy disk drives built into the casing..

The  'Really Stupid Person Virus' aka 'Name and  Address  enclosed 
Virus'..
This  otherwise insidious nasty and subtle link virus  was  caught 
and  stopped at an early stage as the coders name and address  was 
found to be embedded in the code.. It went something like this..

"hi  tHere,  diS is dE BlaK BoMmBer viRusS - fOr mOre GrEat  WaRez 
aNd  sTUf  wHy  nOt cOnTakT:- kev dibley,  54  macarther  cresent, 
plymouth     pl2    4dy.     -    I    rOol    and    yu    suKK!! 
Hehehehehehehehe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

But  then  again,  were people REALLY that kind of stupid  in  the 
olden days??

The  'May  the 8th Virus',  aka as 'But nothing  actually  happens 
today Virus'..
In  a  vain attempt at one-upmanship on the infamous  'Friday  the 
13th Virus',  this strain was set to detonate on Atari hard drives 
across the land on May 8th..  Unfortunately, this is the one day a 
year  especially set aside where absolutely nothing  happens,  and 
the  overall mood of that day is of sitting in a fit  of  despair, 
staring  at  a  blank wall,  and waiting for the 9th May  to  come 
along.. Therefore, this Virus didn't either..

The   'Total   Buggery  Virus'  aka  'Let's  stitch   up   Michael 
Schussler real good Virus'..
This  totally  vicious amalgam of several common  types,  such  as 
Ghost  Virus,  Blue  Bastard  Virus,  the PLO Virus,  and even the 
'Squeaky  Supermarket  Trolley  Wheel Virus'  was  thought  to  be 
'packaged'  as  a personal revenge against the  former  Editor  of 
Maggie,  and part-time German,  Michael Schussler by a disgruntled 
punter..  Strangely,  no-one  else  discovered,  or had any trouble 
with  this  virus,  and a footnote in an early edition of the  UVK 
manual  suggested  that this infection was something of  a  'jolly 
good giggle if your name is not Michael Schussler..'
 
The 'Lancashire Virus', aka 'Gracie Fields'..
Yes,  and  it's  the unforgettable strains of  'Workers  Playtime' 
wafting  through your soundchip once more,  thanks to this  little 
beauty,  Gracie  Fields,  George  Formby and co strut their  funky 
stuff  once more leaving tractor tracks in the fetid muck that  is 
your brain.. Turns your computer into a black pudding and asks you 
what you did in the War..  No known cure for this one,  apart from 
complete physical destruction of the affected unit..  Not included 
in  UVK as the Netherlands has no concept of blokes in  flat  caps 
ordering  portions  of  chips  and gravy  with  a  side  order  of 
whippets..  I  gather the nearest they can get is to take the piss 
out of Belgians instead..

The 'Windows Virus', aka 'AAAAGGHHH!!'..
The  latest  and worst of the so-called  'hardware  transformation 
virii'..  This  infection can turn your perfectly reasonable Atari 
overnight  into  a  bloated  chunky  overpriced  nightmare  of   a 
computer..  Cunningly  altering your base specification to make it 
seem  like  you have got more performance,  but really have a  lot 
less..  The  CPU  is altered to an inferior make,  your hard  disk 
space  is tied up by an obese 'operating system',  your system RAM 
is  now  pitifully inadequate for the simplest  of  applications.. 
Worst of all, your previously healthy bank balance suffers a steep 
decline, and you are forced to experience endless hours of CD-ROM
based 'multitedia'.. 

There  is no known detection or cure at the early stage,  and  the 
only  ultimate  remedy is to allow the afflicted  person  to  grow 
bored  and  sell the PC a few months later..  Then you can  slowly 
reintroduce them to the world of Atari..

And  I  think that wraps that one up for now..  Don't rule  out  a 
return  to this article if I get any future ideas  for  subsequent 
issues..
