One  of  the  best  motorbike racing games  on  the  ST  was  the 
conversion  of  an  even more  classic  coin-op,  Super  Hang-On.  
However,  it had been some years since a new bike racing game had 
been seen on any Atari platform.  On the Jaguar - which, up until 
quite  recently had been slated for a relatively small number  of 
titles,  Super Burnout was one of a number of top-class  releases 
of late 1995.

On switching on the Jag, the familiar logo presents itself to us, 
followed by a spectacular opening sequence for the game, together 
with some lovely bike sounds and a pulsating soundtrack to boot.

Like Super Hang On,  Super Burnout gives a selection of  courses, 
ranging  from the easiest to the more difficult.   The easiest  I 
found  was the one set in Canada,  but there were tracks  set  in 
both North and South America,  the Far East,  the Middle East and 
Russia.   Most of these tracks were not available to be  selected 
until a certain score had been achieved on a track,  however, the 
range of racing tracks on startup is certainly impressive.

The Jag's pad is used to set various features in the  game,  such 
as  selecting/changing between tracks.   It is also  possible  to 
select  which  bike you want (ranging in speed  and  grip).   The 
bikes  are  recognised models from Yamaha and the  other  big  US 
makes.   Selecting a soundtrack is another option given from  one 
of the many menus in the game.

There  is  also an option to play in two-player mode  -  which  I 
haven't tried yet on this version, but I did have a brief play of 
the two-player mode at the last ECTS I visited.

All in all,  this is an excellent game,  with plenty of that all-
important  ingredient,  gameplay.   Graphics are also  good,  the 
speed of the tracks is also OK,  the only annoying thing I  found 
was the fact that some of the other bikers would crash into me at 
times ...  but I think that is just part of the game.   Much like 
the  roads in the UK these days,  judging by the driving seen  on 
the Police Stop movies!!!

Scores - out of 10


Graphics - 9/10

Sound - 8/10

Playability - 9/10


Unlike  some  of  the  so-called  'multi-tedia'  games  that  are 
advertised and hyped to hell in the software shops,  this is  one 
fantastic game!!!  If you own a Jag, make sure you get it!!

Felice.
