                             ~~~~~~~~~~~

                          BY FISK KOMPENIET


The Senior Dads have  some  real  competition. Sweden's Fisk Kompeniet
bring surrealism back to the demo  scene  in  a big way. Fans of Monty
Python will remember "the Knights that  go  Niiiii!", but here we have
more NIs then you can shake a fish at.

The presentation screen informs  us  that  the  code, ni, and realtime
bugs are by  Longfisk.  (Who  is  in  no  way  related  to Longshot of
Impluse). The graphics, fishworld  and  additional  ni  are by Hatfisk
(who bears no resemblance to hattrick of Impulse.)
"We are the fishes that say  NI!"  screams the opening screen. And who
are we to disagree?

We then enter "fishworld"  -   a  full  screen  starfield  with in the
centre a house on a  piece  of  grass.  This  rotates about as various
wacky samples are played  ("NI!"  being  a  particular favourite). The
tension mounts. The door creaks open and  a fish swims out and William
Shatner croaks "To boldy go, where no fish has gone before".

We are then deafened by a cacophony of NIs and the demo ends. Perfect.

You are then presented with  a  menu  of  comedy  exit options such as
switch to vga hirez, change vbr,  and  mess  up non volatile ram. Most
demo exit seem to mess everything  up  anyway,  so  I don't know why I
went to all this trouble.

My only gripe with this demo is a  somewhat personal one, I once had a
girlfriend called Ni - and yes  everybody  saw the comedy potential in
her name. Needless to say it didn't last long.

This demo is a must for all fish lovers everywhere. NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!
