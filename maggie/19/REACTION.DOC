On a positive note from last time,  Maggie 18 got the attention of 
the  glossy print magazines in a manner not seen since  ST  Review 
managed to review issue nine, a year or so after it was originally 
seen out.. Due to an intensive lobbying campaign by people jumping 
up and down,  yelling "Oi,  oi, look at this!", we managed to make 
the  big  time in the review pages of both ST  Format,  and  Atari 
World..  We  also like to think that the new Falcon shell may well 
have held something of interest for these reviewers as well..

Here's what they had to say..

ST Format, issue 76, Nov 1995..

"Diskmags often don't reach their first birthday,  let alone their 
fifth,  but that's what Maggie has just done. It's doing very well 
under the current British editorial team of CiH and Felice."

"Maggie 18 marks the first appearance of a separate Falcon version 
too.  Coded  by  the talented Reservoir Gods,  it's a visual feast 
with  a  neat  and  fast control system.  The  articles  are  well 
written,  informative,  and  often  amusing,  and  both the ST and 
Falcon reader shells are easy to use. If the authors maintain this 
standard, Maggie may well have another five years in her." 

(STF Rating: 79%)

CiH  Comment,  a  very positive review,  with lots of nice  things 
said.. Some people might think that 79% is a tiny bit lightweight, 
but I suppose something had to give, especially after they saw our 
issue 16 'ST Doormat' stunning parody cover!

We  turn to Atari World for their review of Maggie 18,  which  was 
treated to a half-page in their Public Domain column with a rather 
nice screenshot of the main menu (grabbed by me..) This was  their 
November issue as well, issue seven..

"The  Maggie  disk magazine has celebrated its fifth  birthday  by 
launching a new issue with a completely rewritten shell that takes 
advantage of the Falcon's extra capabilities. An ST version, using 
the  old  Delta Force shell,  is also available and both  versions 
will run in parallel for the forseeable future."

"The intro plays a Kraftwerk soundalike techno track over white on 
black shock and fade titles mixed in with animated sequences of  a 
ray-traced  torus  before cutting to the main  screen.  While  the 
scroller  (to use the editors own words) displays 'Utter  mindless 
crap'  you can select from the slick icons and call  sub-menus  to 
select articles to read."   

"The  text  displayer is silky smooth with text scrolling  over  a 
moving starfield.  Text can be scrolled a line or a page at a time 
using the mouse or keyboard and everything works as you'd  expect, 
it's  intuitive.  There's  an  icon to return to  the  main  menu, 
another  to  access the options screens and a glowing  icon  if  a 
picture  accompanies  the  article.  The options  screen  displays 
floating  menus over a psychedelic background.  Options to  toggle 
the  starfield  and  music on/off,  save articles as  ASCII  text, 
select  between  ten screen fonts,  select colours and to set  the 
volume are all included." 

"The articles all appeared original ('Appeared original???' - They 
WERE!!  - aggrieved ed-note!) with Atari related news, reviews and 
gossip  along  with  dollops of music,  film  and  idle  chitchat, 
something for everyone and at least several hours reading."

"There's even a Donkey Kong game to play and a hidden screen which 
can  only  be  accessed  after correctly  answering  a  series  of 
questions - Which I couldn't!"

(Atari World seven out of ten and a 'Buy Me!' award..)

CiH  Comment,  more  of  an advert than a review,  as a  piece  of 
marketing,  this performs brilliantly.. We don't really get a feel 
for  what  Joe Connor (he who wrote the  review)  actually  thinks 
about  Maggie  18 though,  and this review feels like it has  been 
pushed out with a dozen others that he had to write that day..

The review, with accompanying screenshot is very attractively laid 
out,  and  would  excite  the interest of  anyone  not  previously 
familiar with us, or those people who still think that Maggie died 
with Delta Force..  

I've no quibble with their 7 out of 10 rating either,  Atari World 
have a rigorous policy for ratings,  and anything in the 'Buy Me!' 
category has well and truly earned its place there..
  
Other  reviews  will  no doubt be seen in  various  diskmags,  and 
mention  has also been made of a review by 'ST-Computer',  a well-
known (in Germany) Atari mag which was apparently very positive as 
well..
