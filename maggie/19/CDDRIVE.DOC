And just how do you review a CD-ROM drive??

Well,  erm,  it's this box-like thing which you put CDs into,  and 
there you go..

But seriously folks, the MultiSpin is a double speed drive, as the 
name implies,  it has a base audio CD playback speed/data transfer 
rate  of  150kb per second..  This it has in common with a lot  of 
earlier  single speed drives,  such as the Apple SCSI single speed 
model which is still popular with a lot of Atari folk.. The double 
speed  part  literally 'doubles' the transfer rate  to  300kb  per 
second..  This  is more useful if you wish to 'play' directly from 
the  drive  for such things as animations and video  data..  At  a 
push,  and with the right software,  it can be treated in the same 
manner  as  a big but slow hard drive,  albeit one that cannot  be 
written to..  To get a reasonable approximation of hard drive-like 
transfer  rates,  you  would be looking at one of the  newer  quad 
speed CD drives, approaching 600kb/sec..

A quick digression on drive speeds to pad out the review..

Single  speed  - 150kb/sec - slow,  really only useful if you  are 
using  CD  ROMs  as an archive or long term  storage  to  transfer 
specific  data to a faster hard drive when required..  Having said 
that  though,  we  did  get reasonable results for  FLI  animation 
playback on an Apple single speed device using an early version of 
the Apex Media FLI animation viewer..

Double speed - 300kb/sec - middling, acceptable animation playback 
rates, and at the bottom end for performance if treated as a read-
only  hard  drive  - The Autowaschen Verboten  demo  ran  off  one 
collection  disk,  but experienced some music synching and  timing 
problems..  This  drive  option is probably the best one for  most 
typical  Atari owners requirements..  It is somewhat cheaper  than 
going for the next one up, which is..

Quad  Speed - 600kb/sec - fast,  the currently favoured option for 
most  new CD-ROM drives..  More of a compulsory requirement for PC 
owners where the majority of games now come on CD-ROMs,  and speed 
and  access  times are real issues there..  Less vital  for  Atari 
owners  who  can get along with single or double speed  drives  as 
there  are  only  two games (to date?) which come on  CD  for  the 
Falcon..  Animations expected to run flawlessly off these.. Do you 
really need to pay the extra cash though??

Even faster ones,  six, eight and ten times speed.. For the person 
who  needs  something  suitable to sit  alongside  their  200  mhz 
Pentium PC..  More the sort of kit which is a tedious conversation 
piece for your consumer-goods bedazzled mates, than of real use to 
most  Atari people..  Still if anyone does have an  Atari-specific 
application that can make use of such a high-spec drive??
 
Digression over, what of the thing itself?

The  MultiSpin comes as a 'bare' drive which needs to  be  slotted 
into another external box of some kind..  The FAQ on Atari CD-ROMs 
does  advise that this type of drive does go well with  a  PC-like 
tower  case,  fitting  into  the sort of space where a  5.25  inch 
floppy drive would have gone in,  in yesteryear..  The alternative 
is a hard-drive type external case and bezel,  in my case provided 
for  me by Mark and Dave hardware procurement services  inc..  The 
case design is a very solid one, supplied by RS Components..

Controls  are  very  simple,  a button to front load the  unit,  a 
simple  tray  (no caddy) to put the CD on,  press the  button,  or 
gently  nudge  the tray lid to get it to close,  and off you  go.. 
There  are also two busy lights to indicate that a disk  is  being 
read  or spinning up to full speed..  Also on there is a headphone 
socket and volume control for audio CD use..

The rear features audio,  power, and of course, SCSI connections.. 
The  device  is  quite happily included in  any  'chain'  of  SCSI 
devices,  coming after the external hard drive..  This should work 
with  any  of the current CD-ROM drivers available for the  ST  or 
Falcon,  in  this case,  ExtenDOS does the business quite happily, 
filling  in  where  TOS does not deign to go,  and  including  the 
MultiSpin in, as a normal part of the desktop..

The  drive  is compatible with the common ISO9660 High  Sierra  PC 
compatible  format,   and  is  also  Photo  CD  (TM)  multisession 
compatible as well..  What actually runs off it depends on how the 
disks  themselves  are mastered..  Some software will happily  run 
straight off it,  other software will crash..  A lot of disks tend 
to  archive  their data anyway,  so these have to be  unZIPped  or 
unARCed  in  any case,  and no,  STZIP and Kobold do not work with 
ExtenDOS, it seems..

If  the appropriate audio players are included,  then it can  also 
play audio CDs as well..

It  even comes with a brief,  and to the point manual,  printed in 
several  languages,  most  of the setting up and  trouble-shooting 
sections  do  seem  to  be specific to  PC  owners,  although  the 
information  about  the general layout of the drive is  useful  to 
anyone.. If you already have an external SCSI hard drive, then the 
included  SCSI ribbon cable connector is sufficient,  otherwise if 
this is your first venture into the world of SCSI,  a SCSI to SCSI 
2   adaptor   cable  is  needed,   and  these  are  never   cheap, 
unfortunately..

If  you  are  looking  for a CD-ROM  at  a  reasonable  price  and 
specification, this one is worth looking at.. If you know what you 
are  doing,  or  know someone else who does..  This is a  solution 
which  needed a bit of work with reference to the  external  case, 
and  the  software to drive the device is an extra  item  too..  I 
managed to come in at a price of under œ120 to get it running, but 
a lot of that was down to local suppliers working in my favour..

If  you  are looking for something a bit more  'pre-packaged'  and 
guaranteed hassle free, than something like the Aiwa ACD-300 drive 
is  available  from the better known Atari hardware vendors  at  a 
shade less than œ200 for a similarly specc'd double speed drive..
