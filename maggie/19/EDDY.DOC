                                             Owd Landon Tawn E17

"Now take Holland fer instance.."

"Ah  yes,  Holland,  editor  of  that  ST Diskmag  that  'as  just 
celebrated five successful years.."

"Right,  year  in,  year  out 'e produces wot many see as the best 
disk mag on the ST scene."

"Indeed 'e does Ron.."

"But I tell you,  if 'e were to say that Maggie 19 would be coming 
out at Christmuss time,  or shortly after,  and then it's February 
and  there's  still  no  sign of a disk  stuffed  envelope  on  my 
doormat, I'd say:-"

                       "OI HOLLAND! NOOOO!!!"

        "AVE YOU SWAPPED YOUR FALCON FOR A PC OR SOMETHING?" 

                   "YOU ARE BANG OUT OF ORDER!!!!"


"I couldn't 'ave put it better myself Ron.."

Knees up mother Brown, it's actually a letter from Ed Cleveland in 
Liverpool..

Is Maggie 19 not out yet, or didn't you get my letter & disks? Did 
my  Xmas Post paranoia come true?  Did Postman Pat not deliver?  I 
assume one of the following has taken place..

1.  Maggie isn't finished yet due to extreme lack of Joanna Pacula 
articles from Felice..

2.  Temporary  Christmas  Postman  Pat has stuffed  the  oversized 
padded  envelope I sent you into his wardrobe and it's not  coming 
out until the police catch him.. 

3.  CiH  suffers  hasty  blow  on  head  causing  temporary  brain 
malfunction,  leaves  the Atari scene and "upgrades" to a 135  mhz 
Pentium PC with 32 meg of RAM, boots up Windows 95 and plays Rebel 
Assault II a lot.. 

4.  CiH  goes  into mince pie induced coma over Xmas,  is  brought 
around  by  repeated showings of Cindy Crawford  exercise  videos, 
only  to  discover  that  it is February  and  it's  still  bloody 
freezing!!

5.  Mutant  virus  from  local  Ministry  of  Defence  Top  Secret 
laboratory escapes and wipes out the entire population of Rushden, 
the  incident is then hushed up by the Government in X-Files  type 
cover    up..    They    follow    the    procedure    used    for 
Windscale/Sellafields  by  renaming  Rushden  to   'Happymeadows', 
hoping  no-one  will  notice..  All mail to and  from  Rushden  is 
pulped..  

6.  Aliens from the planet Tharg land in S.E.  England, kidnapping 
all the people there so they can stuff tubes up their bottoms like 
in  those stupid American moviesd "Based upon a true  story"  that 
keep  turning up on Sky Movies and thus render all  disk  magazine 
production impossible..

If  Maggie 19 is not finished,  can you stick the following  small 
message in it from me? (Okay dokey! - Ed)

"Ed  Cleveland bitterly regrets recommending 'X-Gen' in  the  last 
issue of Maggie as it's really gone down the pan since issue 2.  I 
apologise for any inconvenience this has caused and hope that  all 
the brain-dead 13 year old Megadrive owners it is now aimed at are 
happy with it."

Maximum  is still good though,  zero Jag coverage but still a good 
read..

Well  I've enclosed the customary SAE for a reply,  so get back to 
me  soon,  and  as they say in the Netherlands "My elbow it  is  a 
turnip." (Sorry about tha,  I've been reading too many back issues 
of ST-News lately.)

   Ed!

Well, so they've started already!!

Alright,  we're  NEARLY  there,  just the very last few bits to go 
in.. I must point out that even the most unobservant people on the 
Atari  scene have come to know that when we say "Out by Xmas",  we 
really   mean  "Erm,   February  sometime!"  Why  should  you   be 
any different??

If  we're allocating blame,  well I've been ready since very early 
January,  but  an awful lot of the externally contributed articles 
have  come from STUDENTS and I'm sure you know what  students  are 
like when it comes to handing in essays.. Usually the last minute, 
of the eleventh hour, or a bit later than that if possible.. It is 
exactly  the  same for receiving articles!!  - However,  I'm  sure 
you'll agree that they are worth the wait..   

The  trend is for Maggie to slow down a bit,  as the  super-dooper 
new  Falcon shell is designed with the larger issues in mind..  We 
will tend to want to accumulate more textfiles than has previously 
been the case before going to release,  so unless you all get your 
pens out and start writing really hard,  then the delays are going 
to get a little bit longer in future, I'm afraid..

Anyway,  point taken, this one should be out very soon now, honest 
guv!!

 CiH.. 3rd Feb 1996..
