Something  quite  different  for  the Falcon  now,  as  the  first 
'proper'  3-D  game appears..  Something very different  as  well, 
because  its  point of origin is the  previously  little  regarded 
Czech Republic.. Not known as a hotbed of software development for 
any machine let alone the Falcon, we are somewhat taken aback with 
a  promise of original 3-D related wares from that corner  of  the 
world..

Gravon is its name..

Gravon  is  a  dream realised for all of  those  people  who  ever 
dreamed  of  driving  around the Lake District on  a  sunny  early 
autumn  day in an armoured assault hovercraft..  Very scenic views 
from a variety of perspectives,  cream teas,  souvenir kiosks, and 
sporadic gunfire from enemy drones and helicopter gunships make up 
the unique face-slap of atmosphere that is Gravon..

The  game  goes  into unusualness hyperdrive,  as you are  at  the 
controls  of a machine that takes a bit of getting used to..  They 
come in two parts,  the mouse to influence the braking,  steering, 
and  aiming/shooting bits,  and the joystick to regulate the level 
of power and forward/backward directional thing..

Fine  control is a toughie,  any other 3-D objects within a 60,000 
metre  radius  will  be squashed flat  by  your  frantic  flat-out 
scrabblings  to try to stop the thing,  some of these are  enemy.. 
The fine control aspect is a little bit sluggish,  especially when 
you  are trying to get your sights to a distant foe,  but  inertia 
damping brakes help a bit here..

The  object  of the demo,  and presumably,  final game too,  is to 
destroy  certain  fixed  targets on one of a  number  of  randomly 
generated  island  landscapes,  and avoid being turned into  pixie 
dust yourself, pretty hard to do, as any sort of riotious assembly 
tends to attract the local wild life all to quickly..

The  look  of  the thing is very interesting,  as  several  fairly 
standard 3-D polygons are relieved by the superb truecolour 'mist' 
shading effect used to conceal the more distant horizons.. The 3-D 
contoured  landscape is done very well too,  with a real sensation 
of  height and distance invoked..  The enemy bad guys tend to  the 
seen  too much of it before school of design,  but you do get some 
reasonable trees,  boats,  villages etc.. You, however, seem to be 
driving  an animated pancake with a gun turret on top,  sort of  a 
belligerent dustbin lid if seen from the outside..

The 3-D environment can be described as a 'super-duper  Mindwinter 
style of thing',  and works surprisingly well..  All we need to go 
with  the mists,  is the mellow fruitfulness now..  The Falcon DSP 
keeping  it  moving  at a reasonable lick,  if not  quite  in  the 
PlayStation  category..  The  one problem,  in the demo version at 
least,  is  the  extreme toughness of your foes..  One to one, and 
there is a ghost of a chance..  With three of them, well, might as 
well order the wreath now, and check the firmness of your discount 
vouchers  for  the  local crematorium..  (Burn one,  get one  free 
perhaps!?)

I might also bitch at length about the lack of variety of weapons, 
and  the  sheer difficulty of getting to some  of  the  opponents, 
especially the helicopter,  which I've only killed once,  and that 
was facing it on a downslope of a very big hill where I had a  bit 
more room than usual to do harm..

The sound system is a mixture of naff chip sounds, and interesting 
use  of  their own version of Distance and  Direction  audio  (see 
'Substation')  where you can track a bad guy sonically if you  are 
plugged into a hi-fi system..  Music between game is a reasonable, 
if not stunning modfile tune..

This  game  demo  is descended from something done  a  while  back 
called 'Hover '94',  a full price release is in the works,  but my 
advice  to  you is to try it out to make sure you really  like  it 
first..  It  is addictive in a strange way,  but a slightly easier 
selection of enemies would help a great deal..

Anyway,  quite  a reasonable attempt at a worthwhile 3-D game  for 
the Falcon..
