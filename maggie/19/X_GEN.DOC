                  The Next Generation?? 

A  new  type  of 'Edge-u-Like' gaming magazine,  but  without  the 
shitty bits, which is like, most of the 'Edge' really..

(Issue five Jan 1996..)

At about one hundred pages,  we are relieved to note that this has 
nothing whatsoever to do with Future Publishing..  Instead, we are 
intensely disturbed to find that Dave 'Bandanna-man' Perry is  the 
main man running it.. Do his thin straggly blonde remnants of hair 
conceal a first class editorial brain or not? We find out!  

The format is glossy. but less 'Industry Spokesthing serious' than 
the Edge, A glance at the news pages shows a mixture of heavy "3DO 
M2 standard sold to Matsushita in bid for global domination"  type 
headlines,  with  the frankly silly,  "Star Trek keyboards for the 
PC"..   In   between  are  a  head  to  head  between  Saturn  and 
PlayStation,   bit of news of Ultra 64, and the Sega production of 
games for the PC..  A brief leters page later, and we are into the 
first of the special features..

Yes it's that old favourite,  Sex on the 'net, as a deeply scarred 
Vic Lennard has lent his 'customised' Barbie dolls especially  for 
the  occasion  to an article about 'Web pages which have  tips  on 
seduction,  mail  order  gifts,  and apologies to the fairer sex.. 
(The  obvious tip,  "Get off that keyboard and get out to the pub" 
seems not to have been thought of here, but never mind..)

The  role of women in the mag is next including a feature  on  'PR 
Babes', with several mini-interviews with some of the better-known 
'Babes in question..

(Alison Grant - Interplay)
"Short skirts get higher ratings, fact?  Discuss.."

'I'm  more  a  PVC  girl myself,  but I'll remember  that  in  the 
future.' Says Alison..

Thank you Mr Perry, the cheesiness award is in the post!

At  about  page  twenty three,  we sight the  first  game  related 
feature,  a  big  piece on Wing Commander IV for the PC  and  Sony 
(ecch!)  PlayStation..  The  major  advantage of  the  PlayStation 
version  seems  to be a lack of installation hassles that  are  an 
inevitable part of most PC games..

The  next bout of gratuitious cheesecake storms in with a  feature 
and  mini-biographies of the two 'Gamesmaster Angels',  aka  Tanya 
Kecskes  (the  blonde one who is  English/Hungarian),  and  Helena 
Tepper (the dark-haired one with the nice eyebrows who happens  to 
be   Dutch/Spanish/Polish/English,   you  work  it  out!)  Several 
pictures  of the girls,  not very adorned with clothing are on the 
pages  as  well,  and  you  wonder if Dave Perry  is  running  the 
magazine with a dark and secret private agenda in mind..

("BANDANNA  WEARING MAN FOUND UNCONSCIOUS SURROUNDED BY  SCATTERED 
PILES OF USED KLEENEX AND KNACKERED HAMSTERS!! - WE REVEAL ALL!!")

Lawks-a-mercy, its the reviews section, otherwise known as X-Rated 
now, but we are in enough trouble already..

Up  for  consideration  are  several  games  including  the   Sony 
PlayStation  version of Doom,  (not the best conversion ever,  the 
screen is not as sharp as the Jaguar or PC versions!) Killing Time 
on  the 3DO (more FMV stuff crossed with 'Doom) Virtua  Fighter  2 
for  the  Sega Saturn,  and even a handful of Jag games in  there, 
including  Powerdrive  Rally,  Attack of the Mutant Penguins,  and 
Fever Pitch..

On  all of these,  they are considerably nicer in their  treatment 
than  a  certain  other 'serious' games  mag  produced  by  Future 
Publishing,  Mutant  Penguins  picking up a healthy 89%..  Reviews 
tend  to  be on the short side (a couple of  paragraphs,  lots  of 
screenshots,  and a summing up, and seem to owe a lot in stylistic 
heritage  to the efforts of 'The One' all those years ago when  it 
covered the glory days of ST and Amiga..

After the reviews, comes a short but useful Jargon-Buster section, 
just what do all those glib industry originated phrases mean? What 
is  the difference between destination-based texture mapping,  and 
the  ordinary  sort??  All these and other questions are  answered 
here,  in  a  feature that looks like it puts in an appearance  in 
every issue of X-Gen..  (Didya know the Jag is the ONLY console at 
present  that  has  Z-Buffering  implemented,  it  has  only  been 
*promised* for the PlayStation!!)

And after this,  comes the previews,  or 'X-posed'..  Not a lot to 
report  here  of  interest,  Toshinden Saturn,  *crunch*,  Maximum 
Surge, *yawn*, a raft of glossy and featureless console games, but 
wait a minute,   a two page feature on 'Fight for Life',  which is 
assessed  as 65% complete,  and given a hopeful thumbs up and hope 
to  see it soon sort of thing by Mr Perry..  But back in the bleak 
Midwinter  known as reality,  we all know that this game has  been 
put on hold in a typical Atari display of 'Oh no it isn't,  oh yes 
it is!' type of dithering..

Dave  Perry tries to boost the babe count with a feature on a  3DO 
game, 'Snowjob' (tasteless chortle) with big screenshots of former 
'Dynasty'  babe Tracy Scoggins (Tracy who??)  Another  interactive 
movie which we all know what that means, (ho hum..)

The 'X-Files' show what the different new makes of console have to 
offer, in another of those regular columns, and towards the end of 
the  mag,  we  pick  up speed for the tacked-on  'multi-media'  or 
'We're not just a sad games mag, honest kids' bit, otherwise known 
as 'Admit One'..

This  is a couple of pages of film news and movie reports,  but it 
still  fails to come across with the crucial advice "Why  not  PUT 
DOWN  THAT  KEYBOARD  AND GET OUT OF THE HOUSE  AWHILE  YOU  ACNE-
SPLATTERED LOSER!?!?!" (see earlier..)

A  last babe (modelling an X-Gen t-shirt,  and we are at the back-
cover..

Ok then..

At œ2.95, without a cover disk (albeit with a preview version of a 
book  on  the games industry on the cover  instead)  the  magazine 
feels  a  bit  light in places..   I would certainly  need  to  be 
convinced  to  buy  an issue of this,  (say lots of  in-depth  Jag 
coverage  in  a special feature..) There is lots of  'fluff'  with 
Dave Perry's amusing pseudo-features of women in various positions 
in  the mag,  but most of us hardened pornographers have moved  to 
stronger stuff anyway??

The tone of the mag is a lot friendlier and more approachable than 
that well known Future Published tome 'The Snot',  the reviews are 
possibly  a little TOO nice sometimes,  although they did  rubbish 
one Sega originated Japanese roleplayer/Tetris type game.. A large 
wodge  of adverts took away many of the hundred pages so I felt  a 
little bit cheated of something to read..

Verdict:-
In  the same bracket as Computer and Video Games,  and  'Ultimate' 
(the  OTHER Future mag..) Both the others seem to offer a  meatier 
read  if games and stuff is your thing..  The Babes and  attempted 
off  the wall stuff can probably be found in places like  'Wired', 
'SFX' and 'GQ' magazines.. Apart from the undeniable apeal of Dave 
Perry,  I'm  not  sure  this one is doing a job that none  of  the 
others  aren't already..  However,  at least there is a modicum of 
sympathetic Jag coverage,  which may yet make it essential reading 
for some folk if this carries on.. 

(Issue  6 followed up with more Babe-related stuff,  and also some 
new screenshots of Defender 2000,  the Jag's best hope for a while 
of a top release..)

CiH - Jan '96.. (First one of the year!!)
