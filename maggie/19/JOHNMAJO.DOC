                  ====================================

       Or what I think he would have said if he had agreed to it
       =========================================================


After much travelling and a bit of persuasion, I finally managed to gain 
an interview with John Major, leader of the Conservative party and 
British Prime Minister.


Keefy: Hello Prime Minister.

John Major: Er.. Hello... what was your name again?.

Keefy: Keefy.

John Major: Keefy?, strange name that, is it Jewish?.

Keefy: No.

J.M: African?.

K: No.

J.M. Ah, now I get it, Kee-Fee, it's Chinese.

K: Er, no actually, it's English.  It's a nickname.  Can we get back to 
the interview?.

J.M. Sure, sure.  But I must say that the methods you used in obtaining 
this interview are a little, shall we say, unusual.

K: Unusual ? Why ?.

J.M. Well most people usually write to my press officer and eventually I 
get back to you and say 'piss off', unless of course you're David Frost, 
in which case I'll pop along early on a Sunday morning.  Was the gun 
really necessary?.

K: I'm afraid so, would you have come if I hadn't pointed it in your 
face?.

J.M. Probably not, but you could at least undo these ropes, they're 
really tight, and I think I've got a rope burn on my ankles.

K: Not until this interview is over.

J.M. You do realise that by now this building is being surrounded by 
crack troops preparing to storm in at any moment.

K: Probably.

< Far away, at Conservative party headquarters.>

John Redwood: Hurrah, finally got rid of the bastard !.

Micheal Portillo: Don't you think we ought to do something, like phone 
the Police or the army or whatever?.  After all, he is Prime Minister.

Kenneth Clarke: Okay, I'll make the call.  <picks up phone and dials>. 
Hello?, Toff and Sons?, yes I'd like a giant pizza and 48 cans of super 
strength cider please, oh and bung in a couple of cases of champagne as 
well. Charge it to my account and deliver it to the usual address. Bye.
<hangs up>

Virginia Bottomley: Well, thats the funeral sorted, better announce the 
elections Ken....

<back to the interview>

Keefy: Some people think of you as dull and boring, and accuse you of 
always repeating the same thing five times over.  What would you say to 
people who say that?.

John Major: Dull and boring?!, I think not.  I am a very bright and 
interesting man, friends of mine will tell you I have many exiting 
hobbies and interests outside my parliamentary duties, you just never 
get to hear of me partaking in them.

K: So what are your hobbies?.

J.M: Well, for one, I particularly enjoy football, I like to go and 
watch Chelsea play whenever I can for instance.

K: I thought you said you enjoy football?. 

J.M: I also like the odd game of chess, now theres a really exiting 
sport.  Nothing but action and exitement in every game.

K: Go on.

J.M: Trainspotting is another one of my favourites.  Actually, just the 
other day I finally got the 8:15 to Edinburgh, I've been after that 
bugger for ages.  For a minute I thought it was the 8:15 to Glasgow, but 
when I looked again I found it wasn't.  You know it's taken me almost 10 
years to get it.  Good job I got it actually, because when British Rail 
is privatised, the 8:15 won't exist.

K: Talking of railway privitisation, many people, including people in 
your own party are beginning to think that it will be a major mistake, 
if you'll excuse the pun.  What would you say to them.

J.M: Well, I think its all a bit of a silly panic over nothing really.  
So we're going to privatise the industry and have loads of different 
companies all over the place running each individual line, but that 
dosen't mean the end of British Rail.  Private companies will be able to 
make the rail system a more efficient and reliable one.

K: And of course for them to do this won't take a penny of tax payers 
money?, and fares won't go up at all.

J.M: No, no, no, of course not.  But the service will improve 
dramatically.

K: So what you're saying, is that private companies, without any extra 
funding will be able to make everything run a lot more smoothly and 
efficiently?.

J.M: Exactly.

K: Some experts believe it will mean having so many tickets and having 
to change so often on long journeys, that it will be almost impossible 
to take the train for a long journey in future.

J.M: Well, to begin with there may be a few teething problems, but 
eventually everything will settle down nicely.

K: Yes, right, I believe you, not.   Okay, lets move onto the 
unemployment issue.  The figures have been going down steadily now for 
quite a while, I suppose this pleases you immensely.

J.M.: Yes it does please me, we've worked hard to help as many people 
back to work as possible, and it seems to have worked.

K: So because of your hard work, these people were able to get 
themselves jobs?.

J.M: Yes, had it not been for our policies, they wouldn't have stood a 
chance.  

K: Could it not be that these people have not actually found work, but 
have in fact been shunted to another section of benefit, for example 
sickness benefit.  Or even been placed on a governmemt course or 
something, anything to get them off the official jobless figures. 

J.M: No, thats not true, our courses are designed to help the jobless 
find work.

K: So if they are still jobless, how come they're not counted as such in 
the unemployment figures?.

J.M. Because they're not unemployed.

K: What?.

J.M. They are unemployed, but officially they're not.

K: I see.  Do you agree that were it not for the 16-18 year olds not 
being included in the unemployment figures, the dole queue would be much 
larger.

J.M: Probably, but what do I care?.

K: What?.

J.M: All people on the dole are lazy tossers, and deserve all the crap 
that they get.  They should get out there and do a bit of street 
cleaning or something.  If they are really desperate, they could always 
send their kids out to do a bit of chimney sweeping, and I suppose they 
could always send the wife to do a bit of cotton picking.  If they are 
really stuck for money, they could always hire the dog out as a security
device.  Mind you, we'll take the ruddy lot back off them in tax as soon 
as they tell us about it.

K: Okay, I think we know where you stand on that one now.  Now onto 
something else.  One of my mates, has a mate, whose girlfriend, has a 
brother, whose girlfriends mother used to work at your place as a maid. 
She claims that you were only paying her #2.50 an hour.  She also says 
that when she complained about this, she was sacked on the spot, what 
have you to say about that?.

J.M: Well, as you probably know, I can't comment on individual cases 
since I don't know all the details.

K: But Mr Major, it was you who sacked the woman, so surely you must 
know what happened ?.

J.M: I probably do know, its probably written down somewhere.  But you 
know me, I can hardly remember what happened yesterday, never mind what 
I did a few weeks ago.

K: Hmm...

J.M: Er are the armed police here yet, have they asked you what you want 
or anything?.

K: Er.. Fraid not, there was a woman who went past the window with her 
dog a couple of minutes ago, but that was all.  The only phone call 
we've had was from some bloke called Gino, he wanted to know when you 
were going to settle up his pizza bill.

J.M: Damn, that bloody Kenneth must have been on to them again.

K: Complete change of subject now, how do you rate your chances in the 
next General election, according to the opinion polls, you seem to be 
quite a way behind at this moment in time.

J.M: Ha, ha, ha, yes I know.  But as has been said many times in the 
past, you should never take the opinion polls as gospel.  

K: But you are rather a substantial distance behind, it will be very 
difficult for you to claw back this difference if it is reflected across 
the country.

J.M: Keefy, Keefy, Keefy, you're beginning to sound like that wierd 
bloke with his swing-o-meter.  I think we all acknowledge that Labour 
have absolutely no chance of winning the election.  Thats why we've done 
absolutely nothing except fuck up the country since the last election.

K: And why is that?.

J.M: It's all very simple, the last few years have been a nice little 
holiday for us, we've been able to sit on our backsides and do whatever 
we like.  When unemployment figures are good we congratulate ourselves, 
when they are bad, we either blame someone else, or change the figures 
till they look right.

K: But if you changed the figures wouldn't somebody notice?.

J.M: Nah, we've already been doing it for over a year.

K: But that still dosen't explain how you're going to win the next 
election.

J.M: Oh thats easy, we'll sell the peasants some story about tax cuts, 
and better pensions and the voters will flock back to us in their 
droves.

K: I don't think that will work.

J.M: Why not, it's worked the last couple of times.  Although if things 
are really bad I suppose we could always elect a new leader, or better 
still, start a war against some South American country, that should so 
the job.

<Knock at the door>

J.M: At last the S.A.S!.

K: Actually, no, it was just the paper boy, he couldn't get the paper 
past the grenade in the letterbox.

J.M: Well, they'll be here any minute, and when they do get here, there 
will be no escape for you I tell you, they'll surround this place and 
storm it.  When they get here they'll blow you to pieces.  None of this 
that I am saying to you will ever be heard.  I couldn't give two hoots 
for this country, as soon as I've made a couple of million profit from 
the Saudi's or what-have-you, I'm going to emigrate to Australia or 
somewhere similar, and live out the rest of my life in luxury.  As far 
as I'm concerned the United Kingdom could fall into a five mile hole, 
and I wouldn't notice.

K: Actually, you've just given me a good idea, I think I'll check local 
radio and see if they are saying anything about it.

<Radio>: Former Prime Minister John Major has still not been heard from...

J.M: FORMER!!!, I'VE ONLY BEEN MISSING FOR A FEW HOURS!!.

K: Shh!.

<Radio>: The New Prime Minster, Kenneth Clarke has already pledged to 
find the wherabouts fo Mr Major.

<radio> Kenneth Clarke: We've already despatched two squad cars, but as 
of yet there's no sign of him....

K: Looks like this interview is quickly becoming irrelevant, you are out 
of a job already.

J.M: No problem, I'll get it back.

K: Well, whatever, it looks like this interview is now over, thanks for 
your time, all the best... er... bye.

J.M: Do you think you could untie me before you go?.

K: Err... no, best not, bye.

                                THE END
