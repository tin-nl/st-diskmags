
Herewith  an item which has been sitting on the back burner for  a 
few  issues  now,  the long awaited interview with  the  Unabashed 
Atariophile himself,  the king of Suzy B's software,  the maker of 
the Suzy B's Atari Software Treasury CD-ROM..

MICHAEL BURKLEY!! (Cheers and claps..)

Richard,

Finally!  Here's the interview...


MICHAEL R. (for Richard) BURKLEY - The Interview....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can you give us a brief description of your early  life,  school, 
work (involving the Church)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I grew up in a small town in Southern New Jersey (named Rancocas after
the Ancocas Indians who lived nearby).  When I say "small" I mean it,
for the town had only about 250 people in it when I was growing up.  It
was the same town that my father grew up in so I was blessed (and
burdened) with a lot of family history right from the start.  While my
parents didn't attend church then, they made it a point to send me to
the Methodist church down the street and around the corner.  It was a
community of caring and loving people who taught me about the love of
God in both word and deed.  Believe me, that can make a difference in
anyone's life!

I was always interested in science, and suspected from an early age
that my career would be in those fields.  First I wanted to be an
archeologist.  When I found out that paeolontologists who studied
dinosaurs I switched to wanting to be one of them.  Shortly after
though I found myself back in the archeologist camp!  Southern New
Jersey is rich in Indian relics which can be found walking over
practically any newly plowed field.  While essentially useless to an
archeologist (the sites have been too mixed up by farming) collecting
arrow points and stone axes was certainly enough to fascinate a growing
boy.

In high school I had a wonderful biology teacher and a chemistry
teacher.  They sold me on the idea of those two sciences.  Having a
teacher who cares can make almost as much difference in a life as a
church that cares!  I began the University of Maryland as a
Biochemistry major.  In my Junior (3rd) year I switched to a
Chemistry and Education double major because I was thinking about
going into teaching.  It was later in my Junior year that I decided
to go to seminary and into the Christian ministry.  That decision
made my last year an interesting one for a Chemistry major!  I took
Greek and Jewish History and lots of other courses that most
chemistry majors don't get to touch.  It made for interesting
discussions around the lab bench!

To make a LONG story short:  I graduated, moved to Massachusetts to
go to Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, met Suzy B (then Suzy E)
and married her a year-and-a-half later, went to school for three
years, took some time off from my studies to work as a research
chemist in polyurethane coatings for 3 1/2 years, went back to school
for one year, did a year's internship in a church in Wheeling, West
Virginia, we had a baby boy, and finally graduated, eight years into
a degree program that is supposed to take only three years!  We moved
to Illinois to serve in a small church (and I thought I was a
"homebody" who didn't move around much!) and we had another baby, this
time a wonderful girl.  Then I bought a second hand 520ST with a
single-sided drive, a color monitor, and TOS on disk.  It was great,
and that leads me straight into an answer to the next question...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How did you get involved with the Atari scene?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I first learned about the Atari ST when I read an article in Byte
magazine about the new 1040 ST.  It was the cover story and it told
about how this Atari was the first computer that was selling for less
than $1 per kilobyte of RAM (this 1 meg machine listed for $999 US).
It sounded great and so I hunted a store up and drooled over one for
quite some time.  I finally got my computer (one of a LONG list of
them!) and needed some software to use on it.  That's how Suzy B's
Software was born...

How did Suzy B's Software come about?  One day in 1989 Suzy and I
ordered twenty single-sided disks from a major PD disk supplier.
After getting the disks and sorting them and discarding the "stuff" we
couldn't use, well, we didn't have much left.  And so, an idea was
conceived.  After nearly two years of work, Suzy B's Software was
born.  We've been in business for about five years now.  Suzy and I
run Suzy B's Software out of our home.  Dividing up the labor between
us, Suzy runs the administrative end of the business while I comb
through the 1000's of online files to bring you the best in Public
Domain/Shareware offerings.  Suzy manages both home and business while
Michael is the pastor of the Niagara Presbyterian Church and the
author of "The Unabashed Atariophile," an ongoing series of articles
in Atari Explorer Online.

Here's some of a press release that can tell you some more about our
business.

Suzy B's Software is buzzing onto the scene of the Public Domain/
Shareware supply services with a difference.  Supplying single- or
double-sided disks as requested, we will fill the disks full with
compressed self-extracting files (compatible with all TOS
versions).  That in itself gives you a good deal, but Suzy B's goes
on to give you what  the owner, Susan Burkley, calls "a honey of a
deal."  She asks, "How many times have you wanted a utility and a
game from a P.D. service but had to buy two disks to get them both?
With Suzy B's we put your individual selections on a single disk so
you can pick and choose and get more of what you want.  Do you want
a game, a children's program, a picture file or two, the most
recent version of ST Writer, and a NASA press release?  You can
have them all on one disk!  All our files are compressed in a
self-extracting format to give you even more of what you want.
Right now we have about 11,000 files from which to choose--our
catalog is over 1,400 pages long--THREE POINT FOUR Megabytes of
ASCII text, and it keeps growing!  It's a lot more  work for us,
but you get a honey of a deal!"

AND NOW (Drum roll....) Suzy B's Software supplies their ENTIRE
library of PD/Shareware software on a two disk CD set.  With over
1,100 meg of uncompressed files this is the most complete and
well-documented set of PD software available today.  The list price
is $69.95 from Suzy B's, but you can order it from most fine Atari
dealers (and likely get a discount, too!).

We also have a program to benefit shareware authors.  After all, we
don't give them enough rewards for their work as is.  It's nice to do
something nice for them, for a change!

To All Shareware Authors (please pass this along!):

Suzy B's Software is offering you an opportunity to increase your
Shareware registrations.  If you will place a brief text
description of our service in your software's documentation (see
below) we will give a free two disk Suzy B's Software catalog
(value $2) _and_ a $3 discount on a Suzy B's Software disk to each
person who registers one of your programs.  If they register two
they will get a total of $6 in credits.  Even if a person is just
_upgrading_ your software (and if you charge money for the
upgrade!) they still get the $3 discount!  Please get in touch with
us if you wish to participate in this program, or if you wish to
get one of our catalogs and see our selection first hand.  Maybe we
can help each other!

   Suzy B's carries an ENORMOUS selection of Atari PD/SHAREWARE
   software as well as having a VERY unique approach to software
   distribution.  Call today for a catalog, I think you'll be
   pleased!

   Suzy B's Software puts your individual selections on a disk so
   you can pick and choose and get more of what you want.  Do you
   want a game, a children's program, a picture file or two, the
   most recent version of almost any PD Program, and a NASA press
   release?  You can have them all on one disk!  Right now they
   have about 11,000 compressed files from which to choose!  With
   Suzy B's software you get "a honey of a deal!"

   Good News!  Everyone who registers one of my Shareware programs
   will receive a free two disk Suzy B's Software catalog (value
   $2) _and_ a $3 credit towards the purchase of a disk from the
   Suzy B's Software collection.  Register two programs, get a $6
   credit towards the purchase of two or more disks; register three
   programs, get a $9 credit towards the purchase of three or more
   disks...and so on!  What if you've already registered, but have
   an older version of my software?  Just upgrade for a fee of $x
   and you'll still get the Suzy B's discount.  Now that sounds
   like "a Honey of a Deal!" Just include a SASE with your
   registration fee so that I can mail a certificate of
   registration back to you for use with Suzy B's.

   Phew! Lotta advertising going on!! - ED..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What  is your local Atari scene like in your area (for  instance, 
retailers who support the Atari range, local user clubs, etc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The local Atari scene is rather sparse in Niagara Falls, NY.  The
closest Atari stores are in Canada some distance away.  They are all
run by good people whom I like.  Our user group is now quite tired.
We meet in a local resturant for coffee and talk once a month.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What,  in your opinion,  is the best Atari show to attend in  the 
US?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any Atari show that is coming up is the best one to attend.  I've
only had the privilege to attend four shows, one in Iowa back in
1989, the Toronto Atari Federation's ACE 93 and 95 shows, and last
year's show in Connecticut.  All were wonderful.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Where  do  you  think we should  put  'Maggie'  on  the 
Internet so that as many people as possible can download and read 
it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I think you should place "Maggie on either the "Hensa" or the UKE- site
in Germany.  Both of these are easily available to me through a Gopher
on Delphi.  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is the best selling ST paper magazine in the USA and why?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ST Informer is the best, and at the moment only, paper magazine for
the Atari in the US.  I like it because it helps keep Atari people
current with what's going on around the world.  It also provides a
valuable resource to those first time Atari users by educating them
about their machine.  The reviews are generally well done, and if
they're not, those in the know let you know!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is your favourite movie of all time?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"It's a Wonderful Life"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Who is your favourite movie actor/actress?
(It doesn't matter how 'obscure' he/she is,  we may have heard of 
them!)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Jimmy Stuart

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What was the worst movie you've ever seen?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"ET"  Who could ever imagine an ET so clumsy!

If  you  can imagine an intelligent alien race which  has  evolved 
over  several thousand years to have its tedious  domestic  chores 
done by someone else perhaps!! - ED..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What kind of music do you like?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Christian Rap, Choral, Classical, Pete Seager-type Folk

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We would like your opinions on a range of subjects:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Piracy..

Force them to write a heart-felt and hours-spent commercial program
and then have everyone else rip it off and brag about it.

The Internet..

Who _pays_ for my calls to Germany and England, New Zealand and
Australia?  Yikes!  It's wonderful!


Censorship (please be as frank as you like!!)

I feel that much of what people put out under the guise of "free
speech" is trash begging for the right without being willing to pay
with the responsibility.  I feel that our society has given up on any
idea of Truth with-a-capital-T, and has nothing to say for or against
violence, immoral sexual behaviors, oppression of the weak, and just
about anything else.  About all that can be said is that "we
personally find that distasteful, but what you do privately is your
own business."  Bull!  My actions affect you; your actions affect me.
If our society is to survive as a just and kind one (or to become one
for the first time) we need to agree on basic societal standards and
enforce them with societal pressures--approval or disapproval.  I
personally think that the biblical standards are the only ones that
will work in the end, and that's the voice I put into the public
stewpot.  I'm willing to make my case and to hear the case of others.
I just don't like the wishy-washiness that I see all around.

But is that a yes or no on censorship? - ED??

The tabloid media (yes,  the kind that always have sex or scandal 
in their pages)..

They are great for a good laugh at the supermarket checkout line.  I
don't think I've ever bought a copy, but I've enjoyed reading the
cover stories of space aliens, miracle diets, and romance.  Does
anyone believe this stuff?

Former Yugoslavia..

I thought that was a country where different groups of people were
getting along with each other.  It was such a disappointment.  Now
it's more than that, it's a horrible tragedy.

If we were ever to visit you (ie myself and Chris),  where  would 
you take us for a night out?

Niagara Falls.  The Falls are beautiful at night with the colored
spotlights that are shone on them.  During the day I would take you
on a "Maid of the Mist" boat tour.  Those boats take you close enough
to the bottom of the Falls that you feel like you are in a driving
rainstorm.  You have to look WAY up to see the top of the Falls.
It's great!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your opinions are welcomed on the following people in this  world 
and what you think of them...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bill Clinton (and his government)..

While it appears to me that Bill Clinton has covered up his
immoralities to win his election (covered up rather than repented of
them), I do like most of what he stands for.  His care for the poor,
his compassion for the sick, his committment to justice for the
oppressed all catch my attention and make me proud that he is my
President.  Unfortunately, he also has many characteristic stands
that I strongly oppose.  The first is his committment to abortion
"rights."  His statement that he wishes to make abortion "legal,
safe, and rare," just doesn't match up with his actions.  He has
encouraged legislation that increases abortions and does nothing to
reduce either their need or their frequency.  I don't see how a
President who cares so for the unwanted needy of our society can
forget all of those babies that are killed in abortions.  I know all
the arguments, but to me, the fact that a life is at stake is much
more important than the emotional comfort of a woman.  She can be
comforted and supported in a terribly trying time.  All that can be
done for an aborted baby is to have her thrown away.


The British Royal Family..

It's a shame that fame and status are allowed to prevent human people
from having human problems that can be helped.  Right now it seems
that they have to be perfect until everything falls apart.  If help
was given and received before then then the situation wouldn't have
to have fallen apart in the first place.

Rutger  Hauer (the actor who does the Guinness ads on TV and  has 
been in many movies, most recently 'Fatherland')..

I never heard of him!


Vladimir Zhirinovsky..

He is a fearful joke to me.  I thought his recent fist-fight on TV
was characteristic of him.


Lech Walesa (president of Poland)..

I have good feelings towards him, though I really know very little
about him.  He is certainly a man of courage.  I hope that he
continues to prove to be a man of wisdom and restraint.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We would like your opinions on the following events and how  they 
could be prevented from happening in the future....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Holocaust..
I am amazed that so many people no-a-days are saying that the Jewish
Holocaust by the Nazi never happened.  If a person is determined
enough not to hear or see history I guess it is possible for him or
her to deny it.  The High School class in our church is doing a
week's study of the Holocaust during their Vacation Bible School.
We've watched a Nazi propaganda movie entitled, "Triumph of the
Will."  It's an astounding movie that manipulates your emotions so
very effectively.  By the end of it part of me wanted to stand up and
cheer Hitler while another part wanted to retch.  We then watched a
French movie entitled, "Night and Fog."  This movie showed some of
the results of the Nazi propaganda machine as shown by the Nazi Death
Camps.  Horrid and beyond.  It ended with the officers of the camps
saying, "It was not my responsibility,"  "It was not my
responsibility," and with the question, "Who will take the
responsibility to stop this monster that is still alive, but
slumbering, today?  Tonight we watched part of the movie, "The Hiding
Place" a movie based on the autobiographical work of Corrie Ten Boom
of the Netherlands.  She and her family were Christians who helped to
save hundreds of Jews from the Nazis.  They were finally captured by
the Germans and sent to concentration camps themselves.  All died
there except Corrie.  It's a powerful story of faith and work, of
struggles against tyranny, and of life even in the midst of death.  

We are having a much quieter High School Vacation Bible School class
than normal!


The hole in the ozone layer..

I am astounded that the nations of the world have actually done
something about this environmental disaster-in-the-making before the
disaster arrives upon us.   Countries are even stopping the
production and use of Cloro- and Bromo- florocarbons more quickly
than they agreed to do!  It's nice to see people doing something
right for a change!  Already there is a decline in those chemical
populations in our atmosphere.   If we don't do further stupid things
(and I wouldn't bet on that!) it seems that we have turned the corner
on this problem.  Of course, there are still problems with the
alternative chemicals used for refrigerants and industry, but I feel
fairly confident that these will be appropriately dealt with.  The
problem is being recognized, and that is more than half the battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What,  in your opinion,  has been the most memorable event of the 
remembrance of events which occurred during the Second World  War 
(ie the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Auschwitz, and other 
events that have occurred recently)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I write these words near the 50th anniversary of the dropping of the
Atomic Bombs on Japan.  Those events are much in the news here with
cross accusations flying faster than B-29s.   It saddens me that our
country was the first (and only) country to use nuclear weapons in
war.  I don't think it was necessary though I don't know if the
leadership of the day knew that.  Japan was already talking of
surrender, but how far up the chain of Allied command that talk had
passed seems uncertain.  Today, that does not matter.  The U.S. was
responsible for the dropping of those bombs; now we need to be
responsible to make sure that such horror never happens again.

Thanks for the opportunity to sound off.  I'm also glad to tell you a
little bit about Suzy B's Software.  I hope you'll buy one (or more)
of our CD set!
