                               -EVOLUTION DEMO-

                                  - by EXA -

Its funny how the Atari scene is  now  dominated by the French and Germans. The
once 'megamighty' Swedish scene  seems  to  have  died,  and  here  in good old
blighty there are only  a  couple  of  active  groups.  But  over in France and
Germany they are at it like rabbits -  or teddy bears, going on the graphics of
this demo.

If you want to ingratiate  yourself  with  a  German,  you  pretend to hate the
French. There is still animosity between the two countries. It is quite amusing
that the country to complain loudest  about  the French nuclear testing are the
Germans - any excuse to put the boot  into an old rival. Each country has there
own traits, and you can quickly spot  the  origin  of  a demo by looking at its
design (or lack of it!)

EXA are  a  new  crew  from  France  that  have  formed  from  the  remnants of
Adrenaline. Their new name bears  an  unfortunately  similarity to another well
known french crew, although there old name  bore an even closer similarity to a
British ST crew (Adrenalin).

As this  is  a  French  demo,  it  comes  with  all  the  trimmings  -  for the
uninitiated, that means "design" (or "dezign" as these illiterate foreign types
prefer to say). This also draws another contrast between the French and Germans
- whilst  the  Germans  go  for  efficiency,  squeezing  every  last  ounce  of
performance from the machine,  animating  every  single  pixel, the French will
stick a mushroom in the bottom right  hand  corner and call it "design". That's
the difference - Gallic  flair  versus  German  efficiency,  the skill of  Eric
Cantona (or David Ginola) versus the ruthless efficiency of Klinssman.

The music starts playing as the  demo  loads,  good  DSP replay here. Then demo
begins with some nice pictures - a 256 colour drawing featuring a scantily clad
elven female announcing the groups name  followed  by  a Niko style true colour
"Evolution" logo. The presentation here is  good  with some nice wipes clearing
the screen.

Then we are into the  first  effect  -  a  rotating  zoomer,  which must be the
grandad of Falcon effects seeming as it  was  featured on one of the first ever
Falcon demos. This zoomer doesn't add too much to the genre - its certainly not
as impressive as the one featured on the Avena fried bits demo - but it is very
well presented and zooms a  variety  of  nicely  drawn  graphics, each of which
morph into the next  bit,  hence  the  name  (roto-morph-zoom). The actual area
being zoomed is pretty small (about 160 x 160), but Exa fill up the rest of the
screen will a nice logo and  other  eye catching graphics. This illustrates the
difference between the French and the Germans,  if Inter were doing this effect
they would have set the videl into  double  line mode with extra wide pixels so
the whole screen was taken up with the zoomer. I'm all for fancy borders.

The zoomer hardware scrolls off (still rotating)  and the screen is filled with
another excellent true colour picture. This  fades  into a picture of a castle,
and with a flash of the screen the  castle comes to life in the most impressive
effect in the demo. The whole castle becomes  a 3D entity and you fly around it
viewing the turrets  and  drawbridge.  The  whole  thing  is lightsourced, full
screen and running in  true  colour  mode!  Pretty  damn  impressive to say the
least. Its a shame this effect, like  so  many others in the demo, doesn't last
very long. This is my favourite effect in  the demo, nice to see an original 3D
scene - congratulations to the guy who designed the castle, which is apparently
based on the Trecesson castle built during the middle ages near the Broceliande
forest. (Take note architecture fans).

As the castle fades out,  we  are  presented  with an excellent fantasy picture
which was one of the entries in the  fried bits III graphics competition (if my
memory serves me right) and damn fine  it  looks too. There is some dude trying
to fend off a massive dragon, I reckon his chances are pretty slim. We are then
treated to a playpen scene - presumably  featuring  Exa in their early days, or
are these guys all child  prodigies?  Some  credits  appear  on  the top of the
screen.

We now get the plasma part, an effect  which is notoriously hard to describe. I
will try - it sort of hardware scrolls up a bit and there are waves of... nah I
don't think I can. In a word - quirky.

Here comes the greets! The  screen  has  a  twilight  zone  style spiral in the
middle and the greets (1 plane) rotate  and  zoom from the centre. They are all
timed to the  drumbeat  of  the  music,  and  EKO  get  special  emphasis. This
sometimes doesn't fade out properly (take note bug fans). Spooky.

A teddy bear hardware scrolls on from the left. He is obvious a relative of the
ones featured in EKO's System demo - in  fact he was drawn by the same graphics
artist (Flan). He has a Z drawn on  his stomach to announce the arrival of (cue
fanfare) Z buffered iconvex gouraud shaded  shapes (phew what a mouthful!). And
very nice they are too - if you have  seen 'System' you know what to expect. It
even has a heart that  looks  identical  to  the  one  in  the greetings bit in
system. Very well coded, it is a  shame  that  it has come out after system, so
the effect is somewhat devalued.

We know get the obligatory end scroller  with whimsical piano tune, and you are
left with the feeling -  "great  but  short".  This  was apparently released at
Gigafun 95 - I expect it won the  competition  (if there was one). You can then
press space to quit and  everything  fades  nicely  out.  (Then my monitor goes
haywire as they don't set  the  screen  back  properly  but we will ignore that
bit!)

So there we have  it  -  Exa's  first  Falcon  production,  a  big step up from
Adrenaline's releases and a demo that  everyone  will want in their collection.
If this was released a year ago, everyone  would be looking at it wide eyed and
open mouthed and it would claim  its  place  as best Falcon demo. Unfortunately
for Exa, the stakes have been raised  significantly with Fried Bits III and the
three stupendous, genre-defining demos  released  there  (by  EKO, Avena/DC and
Lazer), which took all the elements  of  this demo to their natural conclusion.
So whilst this demo is very well  coded  and presented, it doesn't really bring
much new to the Falcon  scene.  The  effects  such  as the rot-zoom and gouraud
shaded z-buffered objects are  all  very  well,  but  it  is  time  for a fresh
perspective, a fresh approach. The coding  skills  are definitely here, but the
ideas are lacking slightly.  The  true  colour  castle  screen  is the one that
captures the attention -  "we  want  more!"  is  the  cry  from the Maggie team
offices.

I  suppose  this  demo  reminds  a   lot   of  EKO's  "system"  and  Abstract's
"experienced" which is in itself,  no  bad  thing.  As  debut demos go, this is
pretty special and EXA are a  crew  to  watch  out  for in the future. Their 3D
routines really are excellent  -  if  I  was  EKO  I  would start sweating! The
graphics and design give it a  definite  stamp  of  Gallic cool. The French are
back. Vive la difference.

 Graphics: 90% Brilliant full-screen pictures and nice design.

 Sound: 70% Average music, well synced to the effects.

 Code: 90% Excellent 3D routines, gouraud shading, zooming.

 Gee-Whizz: 82% Great effects, if nothing new.

 Overall: 87% A solid competent demo, if not r-evolution-ary.
