

                       The Maggie Team..  

                   And assorted greetings..

The cast and crew for this issue now follows, sorry about that..

CiH..
The  editor  who is big..  Not quite Robert Maxwell big,  not  yet 
anyway,  but  has been working on the bigness thing over the  Xmas 
period by consuming vast warehouses of food and lakes of drink, so 
he could end up being huge fairly shortly.. 

Felice..
Deputy  ed who is quite little..  cannot be blown away like a leaf 
on a stiff breeze,  but equally,  would not give any problems to a 
heavyweight boxer or 'Gladiators' contender..

Leon..
He  is  quite  small as well..  Pixie-sized,  so cannot fit  in  a 
matchbox, but could probably squeeze into a shoebox..

Tash..
Leon's  sister,  and  carries  the genetic smallness thing  a  bit 
further..  If  she  turns  sideways on,  she  effectively  becomes 
invisible  in  a  crude  but effective  form  of  early  'stealth' 
camouflage..

Kev (SH3)..
Medium  with generally unremarkable physical characteristics,  but 
his  hair  tends to draw more attention to him depending  on  what 
colour  it  decides to be..  The opposite to Tash as Kev has  been 
used as an improvised marker buoy for ships in distress..

RiCH (Davey)..
He is medium to large, but would like to cultivate big hair..

Mike Noyce..
Rugby  player sized..  The thundering of feet across the Serengeti 
plains may not be all due to charging Rhinos??

Kev Davies..
Tall, this fellow goes straight up and down..

Enough, please, enough!!

Greetings and thanks..

Tronic, for your helpful contribution once again..

Keefy, for your large contribution on the articles front too..

Tat,  for your efforts too,  and those nice little preview screens 
for the Falcon.. Full demo soon??

Mike  Mee  (MUG UK TM),  for your unexpected letter..  Hope to see 
more of you soon in these pages, Mr 55% converted PC owner!!

Ed Cleveland, for the LONG letters, and excellent article!

Tony Greenwood, for his appearance in these pages too..

Gary Simmons for his combined news/advertising feature..

John  (VoGue),  good  luck with the 'Web pages,  and hope you  get 
that virus sorted out!

Rich  Karsmakers,  well  what can we say!  (Not a lot really,  how 
about "Nice one Rich??!" - That usually does the trick..)

Slimer and DBA,  for scaring the Atari community with their unique 
'emulation' of Windows for the Falcon..

Phineas and Alison,  look forward to the reborn Falcon Obsession.. 
Thanks for all your material assistance for this issue..

Karl  B,  and thanks for your help on the silver platter front  as 
well..

James Mathews, he thinks 'Tat' stands for 'Taunton Atari Terrors!'

Michael  Burkley  for  his interview and  contribution  of  review 
material..

Colin  Fisher-McAllum  for  his interview,  keep the  Falcon  flag 
flying mate!

Kevin Beardsworth for joining in the candid disclosure fun too.. 

The man from Chile who E-mailed us about Maggie 18..  Probably the 
most southerly Maggie reader in the World! South Pole anyone??

The folks at Titan/Black Scorpion for keeping their end of  things 
up..

Andrew Wright, nice magazine, nice show..

Alan Johnstone, thanks for the Xmas card, must see you soon!

All  scene people currently at work on new and  exciting  things.. 
(Bit of a cop-out, eh!) *Aggression party!*

And that will do for now..

 CiH - 'Dec '95..

NB.  When the greets and dedications are longer than the main bulk 
of the mag, it is well overdue!!
