Unique  Developments have confirmed what has been suspected for  a 
little while now, they are pulling out of any further developments 
on the Atari market.. Whilst nothing definite after SubStation had 
been  announced  anyway,  this still means the loss of the  Falcon 
version  of  Obsession,  and any future upgrades to SubStation  or 
the extra levels disk for Obsession.. 

The  main reason for this,  has been 'lack of time' as UDS are now 
concentrating on projects for the Jaguar and PC, and also consider 
in  the specific case of Falcon Obsession,  they have decided that 
this is uneconomic to pursue any further..

Maggie viewpoint..
This  is not totally unexpected,  it seems that once an individual 
or  company has established themselves in the Atari  entertainment 
market,  (as opposed to the serious apps arena) then it is goodbye 
and  see  you  later on a  more  'commercial'  format..  Obsession 
PlayStation anyone??  However,  this touch of the inevitable needs 
to be queried around the edges on one or two points..

Why  are  UDS still bothering with the Amiga..  The  Atari  market 
demonstrated  a more tangible commitment to UDS than Amiga  people 
did,  especially  an Atari market not exactly over-saturated  with 
brilliant  games..  The  Amiga press and public reaction seems  to 
have been noticeably cooler, where there is a bit more competition 
(Pinball Fantasies for one)..  If anyone is going to be 'dropped', 
then  these  people are surely early  candidates  too,  especially 
taking  their  negative comments at Merlin's  promotion  of  Amiga 
Obsession at the Spotlight show last summer into account..

I'm  not  too mad on the idea of the SubStation extra  levels  and 
combat  pack  being dropped,  surely this is something a  suitable 
third party can pick up and deal with on their behalf??

I  wonder just how much of a future they have on PC and  consoles, 
the  prevailing  standard  and levels of capital  to  enter  these 
markets is very high indeed.. UDS are good, but are they that good 
or  well financed??  I think they will find it a lot tougher  than 
they  anticipate,  being used to a relatively product starved  and 
appreciative  Atari  market..  If they do make it,  I think that a 
loss of their freedom as a small independent developer is  likely, 
they  will  be swallowed by someone a lot bigger and be  gone  for 
good..

To end on a slightly hopeful note?

There  is  a  very  slim possibility  of  Obsession  Falcon  being 
rescued,  it uses the Amiga A1200 256 colour graphics anyway,  and 
such  code  that  has been completed could  be  given  to  another 
competent  Falcon programmer..  Phineas Pope of Merlin is  looking 
into  this,  but  no early announcements as yet,  and this remains 
something of a long shot to be really honest..

**Suplementary note**
Since  the  time  that  article was  written,  it  is  now  common 
knowledge  that  Obsession  for the Falcon  has  been  revived  by 
Merlin,  in  two different versions,  with an initial release date 
around mid-March..
