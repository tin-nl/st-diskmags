Or what was happening all those years ago..  This time,  we take a 
look  back  at the front page of the Xmas 1985  issue  of  Popular 
Computing Weekly, back when Sony were toying with something called 
MSX, Sinclair QL'd its way into the public affection, and C5'd its 
way right back out again, and Atari, well read on..

The headline says..

                ..Atari ditches DR programs..

Atari  says  it has scrapped plans to  bundle  Digital  Research's 
GemWrite and GemPaint with the 520ST.

"As  a  result  of Digital Research's failure to  supply  us  with 
satisfactory  product,  we will instead be supplying two different 
programs" said Rob Harding, Atari UK sales and marketing manager.

"We feel we cannot keep our customers waiting any longer."

He added, "As far as Atari is concerned, it's permanent."

However,  a Digital Research spokesman responded, "The contract is 
not cancelled,  and the alternative programs will be provided as a 
temporary substitute."

A  meeting  between  the  two  companies  took  place  as  Popular 
Computing Weekly went to press.

GemWrite's substitute is FirstWord,  a word processor package from 
Cambridge company GST. "It has a full windowing facility and is of 
a similar standard to GemWrite." Rob Harding commented.

"The second program is DBMaster1,  from Stoneware,  a US firm. "We 
chose a database program in place of GemPaint because we found out 
that many ST's sold are going to small business users,"  explained 
Harding.

Atari  has  added  two more programs to the  'bundle',  Doodle,  a 
graphic package, and Megaroids, an asteroids style arcade game.

It is not entirely clear what has caused the delay in GemPaint and 
GemWrite.  A  source  at Digital Research said,  "The products are 
coming  and there is no technical problem with conversion  to  the 
68000. But they're not at a stage where they can be supplied."

Present  ST  owners  will  apparently be  supplied  with  the  new 
programs  by  the dealers who sold them the  machine.  new  owners 
should get the packages with the machines they buy.

These titles are intended to stay on disk and will not be upgraded 
into ROM format.

GemWrite and GemPaint were intended to be supplied with the  520ST 
at  launch,  but  have  not gone out with any  machines  to  date. 
However,  the  Gem  operating  system,  and  Gem Logo.  both  also 
supplied by Digital Research are complete and will remain with the 
machine.

The  Gem  operating system is however due to be available  in  ROM 
after  Christmas.  ST  Basic  and Gem Logo will now stay  on  disk 
rather than being upgraded to ROM.

Ednote:-  As  we  all  now know,  the  'temporary  substitute'  WP 
program, FirstWord proved to have a large amount of staying power, 
living  on both in its original form,  doing useful service for me 
right  now  on  a machine not visualised by  Atari  at  that  time 
(yerks!)  and in future 'Plus' formats,  and has only really  been 
superseded  in  the  last  two or three  years  by  more  advanced 
alternatives.. I also still have Megaroids somewhere, but this has 
not  been played for a while,  due to the glut of similar games on 
the Atari more recently..

A  huge sigh of relief as the ghastly Atari Basic did not make  it 
onto ROM!!

Whatever became of GemWrite and GemPaint, I don't know..

'Brataccas emerges for 16-bit micros'

The 'Imagine ex-megagame team' first popped up as Psygnosis  about 
now,  with  this  debut game for œ34.95 for 520ST,  the 512k  'Fat 
Mac',  and  512k  expanded Amiga..  Now you have a good idea where 
these  inflated software prices started!!  - œ34.95 was HUGE money 
back  in  1985!!  And I remember it was a pretty  average  graphic 
adventure  that ran in mono/ four colour medium res,  before  they 
invented  colour monitors for the ST..  Superficially  impressive, 
but little real depth,  which sort of describes what Psygnosis did 
a lot of later on too..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
January  '85..  Atari showed six new machines at CES in Las Vegas, 
these were the 65XE,  65XEP,  65XEM,  130XE, 130ST (really? - ED), 
and 520ST.. Only a couple of these eventually appeared..

April,  Atari  launched the 130XE and 520ST at the Hannover  Fair, 
losing  the  other machines announced in January from  the  urgent 
list..

May,  Atari advise that they are not continuing development on the 
130ST,  but  the 520ST should be in the shops for September for  a 
mere œ799! (with mono monitor..)

June, the first 520ST's start to reach developers..

July,  Atari decides to launch the 260ST after all. Amiga launched 
in the US..

September, Atari show over 50 programs on the ST in varying states 
of  completion  at the Personal Computer World Show  at  Olympia.. 
Over 70,000 people visited,  and yes,  I was there too!!  My first 
ever  computer show,  the hall was packed to the rafters with lots 
of good stuff, we enjoyed ourselves hugely, and the PCW Show had a 
special place in my heart as the first and best computer show..

October  Commodore record an annual loss of œ90 million,  and  are 
rumoured  to be licensing the Amiga custom chip set to  interested 
third  parties  next year..  Sinclair Vehicles (C5 et al) go  into 
receivership..  Also not a good year for Acorn who are brought out 
by Olivetti,  Oric,  who go into receivership,  or Bug Byte who go 
into liquidation..

November,  Atari  claim  the  260ST is being held up  due  to  the 
British standard TV modulator, Amiga expected to launch in January 
1986 in the UK, and in the shops by June of that year..

December,  Sinclair  join  the  loss  makers,  with a  mere  œ18.3 
million..

And that was 1985 folks!

(For  the  majority  of people,  a home computer usually  meant  a 
choice  of ZX Spectrum (Plus model,  the rubber key machine  being 
finally  superseded),  BBC  micro (32k),  Commodore 64 (the Plus 4 
never  really  took  off),  and  the only  really  successful  new 
machine,  the Amstrad CPC464 (Amstrad being the only company to do 
well  in 1985..) There were also a sprinkling of things like  MSX, 
Sinclair  QL,  8-bit Atari as well..  The ST and Amiga series were 
very new, and expensive upmarket beasts at that stage..)
