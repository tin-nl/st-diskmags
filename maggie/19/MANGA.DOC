The  hyperactive  Tronic of Effect/Kuba/Arsenic/whatever  now  has 
added  a new handle to his growing list,  now a new 'group  called 
Sublime has released a slideshow demo called Manga Desires..

As  expected,  this  demo is based around a series of pictures  of 
those delightful Manga babes in a series of 'tricky' poses..  This 
is  quite a tasteful demo,  with a 'naughty but nice' theme to it, 
as  some  of the pictures have been tactfully 'cut'..  (I've  seen 
some  of  the originals and know how raunchy they can  get!)  This 
slideshow verges on the edges of acceptability,  and it will still 
be a very brave or foolish PD library that stocks this disk..

The  pictures are GIF originals and have been  carefully  dithered 
down  to  the ST's palette and resolution to keep as much  of  the 
picture  quality as possible..  The end result works quite  well.. 

As  opposed to many recent ST slideshows,  which stop after  about 
eight  or  ten pictures,  and that's your lot,  there is a load of 
material  on  this disk,  which provides more than a  few  seconds 
worth of entertainment.. Sound, on the STFM is a typical soundchip 
tune,  but probably a MODfile for STE..  This does not work on the 
Falcon, getting so far, and then stopping at the second screen..

Not  really  a lot more to say,  but a reasonable effort  all  the 
same..
