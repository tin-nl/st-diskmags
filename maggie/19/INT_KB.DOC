~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can you give us a brief run-down  of  your life so far (where you were
born, which schools you attended, etc) ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I was born in  Swindon  in  1962.  Shortly  after  my parents moved to
Lincolnshire where I have lived since. My infant and primary education
was in Sleaford but I went to  secondary school in Horncastle. In 1979
I started an apprenticeship as a  Motor  Vehicle Tech and have been in
the Motor trade ever since.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems have you
owned?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None I'm sorry to say. I thought  computers  were a waste of space. My
wife convinced me to buy one  so  that  I could do my paperwork faster
and we'd get more time together.  I  think she might regret suggesting
it now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How long have you been an Atari owner?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I bought my first Atari in  1988  from  Comet. I didn't know the first
thing about them. The salesman asked me what I'd be using it for and I
told him it was to keep vehicle  records  on. He said the best one out
of the three I could have  chosen  would  be  the 520STFM. I then went
home and formatted the language disc, like I said I didn't have
a clue.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What prompted you to start the Falcon FacTT File?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I read an article by  William  Hern  in  ST  Apps asking for people to
start a Falcon registry, all I did  was put my name forward by sending
him a letter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How did you get the Falcon FacTT File up and running??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was a collaboration really.  William  rang  me and said he'd picked
three people out of the letters he'd  received and said we should ring
each other and see what we could arrange. Secretly I think he only had
three replies but he never let on. As  it turned out Roger Derry had a
conference facility so we could all  talk  on the phone at once. After
many phone calls Colin, Roger and  I  had  decided on a name, a slogan
and a battle  plan.  We  did  some  ringing  round  and  spoke to some
suppliers at  the  time  to  see  what  reaction  we'd  get. Cambridge
business software were particularly helpful  as were Compo who offered
us a free stand at the 1993 Atari  show in Birmingham. The three of us
decided it would be a great place  to  launch the FacTT File so that's
where it all started.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What do you think of the Atari scene in general??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We're certainly survivors  aren't  we.  Atari  pull  support  from the
serious Computer  side  of  things  and  we're  still  here,  probably
stronger than ever. In fact I can't  remember when the Atari scene was
busier. New software  seems  to  appear  every  month.  We  have a WWW
browser in constant development,  several desktop replacement programs
to choose from, Multi-tasking capable operating systems coming out of
every nook and cranny and shareware programs that put some commercial
equivalents to shame. Atari users never  cease to amaze me, the harder
they're knocked down the quicker they seem to get up.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which demo, in your opinion,  is  the  best  you've seen on either the
Falcon or ST??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I think I've only ever seen 2, they just don't interest me at all.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There isn't one, that's what prompted me  to get involved in the FacTT
File. There's a Tandy's in the  shopping centre, that's where I bought
the Falcon funnily enough but  I  think  it's  the  last Atari he ever
sold. I rely on  the  Atari  shows  and  the  Post  office for any new
soft/hardware I require. That's the great beauty of comms, other Atari
users are never far away.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which computer show(s) do you have fond memories of?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I expect Colin will say Birmingham  1993,  that  weekend is a bit of a
blur for me, so much happened that I just got swept along with it all.
You have to remember that's the first  time  the three of us meet face
to face.  The  most  memorable  show  was  the  following  weekend  in
Manchester, just before Christmas,  there  was  lots  of snow, lots of
people and I had a great time.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is your favourite movie of all time??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That's easy.... Terminator 2.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen??
(Hint....there is a drink for you if  it stars a certain British actor
who got involved with a certain LA prostitute!....ed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It has to be Gone With The Wind, what a load of over hyped crap, I can
say crap can't I.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sean Connery for favourite Actor,  I'm  pretty keen on Barbara Hershey
but that could be lust [Grin].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What do you think of the following subjects?
(please be as frank as you like)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Piracy
~~~~~~~
Programmers spend  hours  working  on  software  so  it's intellectual
theft. Funny thing is  all  the  Atari  owners  I  know use legitimate
software, all the PC owners I  know  use pirate software. I don't know
one PC owner  with  a  legal  copy  on  Win  95.  Praps Micro-Soft are
supporting the wrong platform. [Big Grin]

Censorship
~~~~~~~~~~~
Censorship should be censored. I'm a  responsible adult I'll pick what
I watch or listen too.  I'll  also  censor  what my children watch and
listen too, I just hope I'm big  enough  to  let them do the same when
they're old enough.

The infamous British tabloid newspapers (The Sun, et al)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A complete waste of money, I just will not buy newspapers.

Rutger Hauer (Movie actor & star of Guinness adverts in the past)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well at least he likes Guinness.

Bosnia
~~~~~~~
I'm no politician  but  I  can't  help  seeing  the difference between
Bosnia and Iraq, i.e. Oil.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we were ever to visit you (i.e., myself and Chris), where would you
take us for a night out??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I spose you'd get a  good  laugh  at  Boston Docks. Grantham was voted
most boring town in Britain, all  I  can  say is why didn't the judges
visit Boston.

Seriously I'd take you to  Peterborough  Showcase  Cinema and then the
Pizza hit across the road.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Who is your favourite musical group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pink Floyd

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I can't remember their names but they sang Aggadoo.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All of  Floyds,  Portishead,  Thin  Lizzy,  Metallica,  Genesis, Rush,
Queen, Cranberries, Led Zeppelin that kind of thing.

Ta for that then, and best of luck for the future!!

 Maggie.
