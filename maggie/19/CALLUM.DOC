

The Maggie Interview with Colin Fisher-McAllum, Co-President of the 
UK's One and Only Falcon FacTT File & SysOp of 42BBS!!

Can you give us a brief run-down of your life so far (where you were 
born, which schools you attended, etc) ?

I was born at a very early age in the year 1952, later that year my
family moved from Hertfordshire to London. However it didn't take me 
too long to find them again. My school was a good one, (well, it 
was an Approved School) from which I left with half a dozen O levels. 
Maths not being one of them, I went with my 7 certificates to Barking 
College of Technology where I studied Marine Radio & Radar. 
There being too many dots and dashes for my liking, the closest I ever 
got to a life on the ocean waves was the Isle of Wight ferry to see 
Bob Dylan. Having been so well trained in technical things I ended 
up in Advertising.

Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems 
have you owned?

My first, and only, computer before owning an Atari was a ubiquitous 
Speccy. I even wrote  a few programs on it. "Friggin' The Frog" should 
have made me a millionaire.

How long have you been an Atari owner?

I ordered an STfm in October 1987. The supplier called me a couple of
days later and offered me an STe as they were out of STfms and the
new machine had just arrived. I agreed and was delighted to see the STe 
advertised at œ100 more than the STFm when they were made available in
December. I bought my Falcon in June 1993.

What prompted you to start the Falcon FacTT File?

William Hurn, the author of "Desktop Discussions" in the ST Club 
magazine ST Applications, suggested a Falcon Registry, like the 
ST Registry he used to run, would be a good idea. 

How did you get the Falcon FacTT File up and running??

Kevin Beardsworth, Roger Derry and I may well have been the only people
who approached William, but he made us feel like we were the ones he had
selected [grin]. Kevin and I both owned Falcons and wanted some extra 
information and Roger, as programmer of the shareware address manager 
NameNet, offered a customised database for us to use. Many phone calls
later we had a name and knew how we wanted to set things up and William 
had offered to give us regular mentions in his column. We needed a launch
plan and the new "LeST Get Serious" shows were the answer. Neil 
O'nions gave us a stand at the Birmingham show in December '93... 
The FFF was born.

What do you think of the Atari scene in general??
Atari themselves have proved their ability to produce excellent products
many many times. They have also proved their inability to market the 
goods just as many times. However, third party support in both soft and 
hardware has kept the most die hard Atari owner from changing platform.
The average Atari owner is an enthusiast and therefore willing to stick 
with their beloved machine despite Atari.

Which demo, in your opinion, is the best you've seen on either the
Falcon or ST??

I have seen a lot of demos and I can honestly say... they all leave 
me cold! I can appreciate the programming skill that is required, but
this 'old' man just don't like 'em.

What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc)
Apart from an excellent Falcon user group based... um... in my sitting
room, there is no local Atari scene. The local shops gave up selling 
Atari products ages ago. There is a shop that has just started 
selling the Jaguar, but with the pitiful display of games racked up 
next to the display model, it is no surprise to hear that they are not 
selling as well as the shop manager hoped. 

Which computer show(s) do you have fond memories of?
Obviously the Birmingham 1993 show is top for me because we launched the
FFF there. It amazed me how busy we were. I thought we would have 
plenty of time to look round the show, but the best we could do was to 
grab the occasional few minutes to dash to other stands and to
view the products and introduce ourselves to the exhibitors. Many of 
those the contacts made that day are still working to our advantage 
today.

What is your favourite movie of all time??

Oh boy! that's a hard one... I like action films and Sci-fi. I guess the
film that has impressed me the most is Bladerunner. For special effects
it just has to be the Terminator films.

What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen??
(Hint....there is a drink for you if it stars a certain British actor 
who got involved with a certain LA prostitute!....ed)

The opening scene of that movie was enjoyable... however, the worst 
film is Jaws 2.

Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies??
I lust after Nicole Kidman, so she gets my vote for fave actress. 
It's harder to choose a favourite actor, so I won't!

What do you think of the following subjects?
(please be as frank as you like)

Piracy

I think it's quite right that people who sell pirated software should be 
prosecuted. But how much has the professional pirate actually effected
the Atari scene? Maybe I go to the wrong car boot sales, but I have 
never seen Papyrus, DA's Layout or Apex for sale!

Censorship

I don't like censorship, we must protect the most vulnerable members 
of society, ie children, but I am a mature adult and think I should 
have the right to chose what I do, or do not, wish to see, hear and 
read.

The infamous British tabloid newspapers (The Sun, et al)

I don't read newspapers. I wake up to the Today program on Radio 4
and get all the news and comment I need stuffed into me before breakfast. 

Rutger Hauer (Movie actor & star of Guinness adverts in the past)

He has a funny name... and the honour of featuring in my
all-time fave movie.

Bosnia

I'm not intelligent enough to give an opinion on this subject. However
I'm sure it would have been sorted out by the international community 
by now if there was oil involved.

If we were ever to visit you (ie, myself and Chris), where would you 
take us for a night out??

In Basingstoke?... Ha-ha, he-he-he!!!

Who is your favourite musical group?
Pink Floyd

Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet??
There have been many poor bands over the years, but the stuff I really don't
like is fluffy-pop... Dawn, Brotherhood of Man etc.

Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection?

Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, REM, Eric Clapton and John Lee Hooker. 
On the classical side I like the Verdi and Puccini operas and the 
masses by Josquin des Pres [The Tallis Scholars are by far the best 
when it comes to singing Josquin]

Thanks for your replies, Colin - hope everything goes to plan
regarding the FFF etc.

You're welcome.
