A  slightly  uncrowded  postbag for items of  a  general  interest 
bent..  That  is  not to say I did not receive any other  letters, 
because  I  did..  However most of these were fairly  personal  in 
content,  and  not  really suited to the mag..  One copious letter 
writer  Ed Cleveland was even moved to write me a  proper  article 
this  time,  which  was very nice of him,  so there was no need to 
quote great chunks of his communications to me here in the letters 
pages..

However,  for  the  purists  among you,  a couple  of  interesting 
communications..

This one, part of a longer letter from James Troup..

Cheers for Maggie 16 and 17, despite their age they still make for 
very good and interesting reading. The all new Maggie 18 interface 
is fuckin' brilliant;  I must admit that when you first claimed to 
have  basically  equalled if not topped DBA's interface  I  wasn't 
completely convinced. However, I was proved completely and utterly 
wrong and you have been proved very right, and if anything I think 
the case was understated. The interface is really rather fine, all 
credit to the Reservoir Gods.  

The content is,  unsurprisingly,  up to the very good usual Maggie 
standard.  One  area I particularly like is your reviews of demos. 
Although  DBA do review demos,  I just tend not to like/agree with 
their reviews.  Glossies are of course, completely fuckin' useless 
for this kind of thing,  so I was pleased to finally find good (in 
my  opinion)  demo reviews in Maggie.  I really don't know  how  I 
could  have  missed reading Maggie up until now as it  is,  in  my 
humble  opinion,  one  of the best disk magazines  around  (easily 
beating DBA and coming in second only to ST News).  Anyway, I look 
forward to Maggie 19 with great anticipation.

And this one was from a satisfied customer down in Chile, probably 
the most southerly Maggie reader in the world!!
