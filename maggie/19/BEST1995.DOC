                   THE MAGGIE ALBUMS OF 1995 AWARDS

             PRESENTED BY MR. PINK OF THE RESERVOIR GODS

Depending on where you stood musically  1995  was either the year that
drum and bass left  the  underground  and  became  mainstream or where
Britpop became  the  dominant  popular  musical  form.  Or  maybe  you
remember it simply as the year Robbie left take that.

Here at RG HQ we  are  considerably  underwhelmed by the whole Britpop
movement with it cap doffing to  the  Beatles and the Kinks. We prefer
originality,  excitement   -   not   just   another   twist   on   the
Lennon/McCartney or Ray Davies formula.  For  that reason neither "The
Great Escape" or "Morning Glory" are  included  in this list, so those
of you whose musical horizons extend  no further than Noel Gallagher's
eyebrows (and that's quite a way!) can stop reading now.

1995 has been an excellent year for  music, even though it was missing
some key releases.  Orbital  are  busy  working  on  the  follow up to
Snivilisation (and knocking  up  tunes  for  the  Playstation!) whilst
Underworld released an excellent  new  single,  but  still  no sign of
their next album. Single wise Josh Wink took the charts by storm, Dave
Clarke completed his Red trilogy (with a slightly disappointing Red 3)
and clubs everywhere resonated to the  acid  frenzy of DJ Mishia & Mr.
Tim's "Access". Jungle  proved  the  critics  wrong  by  growing  at a
phenomenal speed. Goldie finally delivered  the goods and every single
techno person worked on a  drum  'n'  bass  project. Tricky's Trip Hop
made a huge impression,  as  did  the  progressive house of Leftfield.
Whilst the press continued  with  their  blinkered obsession with Blur
and Oasis,  dance  music  continued  to  blossom.  And  here  are  the
fruits...

1. LEFTFIELD - LEFTISM

Leftfield are lazy buggers  who  usually  only  manage  to release one
single a year, but when these  include  such masterpieces as "Open Up"
no-one  is  complaining.  Take  your  time  lads!  And  they  did  and
eventually delivered  the  best  album  of  the  year.  Featuring  the
silk(cut)y tones of  Toni  Halliday,  the  manic  tones  of John Lydon
("Burn Hollywood Burn!" He  demanded.  And  it  did!) and the rambling
tones of Lemn Sissay this is techno-pop  right out of the top draw. No
time for minimilisim, never  up  its  own  arse  (it doesn't even know
where its arse is) this album was a crossover success wooing over both
dance fans and the "there's  no  guitars  its not music" neanderthals.
Immaculate.

2. ATARI TEENAGE RIOT - 1995

Whilst Leftism soared the crest  of  a silken sinewave, ATR's approach
was much more rough, but  equally  rewarding.  I initially picked this
album up simply on  the  strength  of  the  title  (I'm  a  big fan of
teenagers - arf! arf!) it turned out to be a real gem. I'm not usually
a fan of hardchore, but this  is  so  well done with real tunes (count
them!) and vocals that make sense  (albeit  mainly in German). You and
your family will be happily  singing  along  to "Delete Yourself! (You
got no chance to win)" and "Midijunkies - gonna fuck you up". There is
also a nice change of pace on  "Sex",  but the award for the best song
title of the year goes to  "Raverbashing"  (respect!). There is also a
lot of pleasing anti-fascist  stuff  (as  you  would  expect from Alec
Empire). This album should be  in  ever  atari freak's collection - as
they so wisely say "The Atari...always one step ahead".

3. TRICKY - MAXIMQUAYE

Not only does tricky pick up a maggie prize for one of the best albums
of the year, he also gets our  award for ugliest bloke in pop! (FACT).
But who cares when he turns on  the style like this. Admittedly Tricky
is a bit of a musical magpie,  and  when you first listen to this disk
you'll think "I've heard that track before" - as the majority of these
tracks are recreated from  the  blueprints  of  Portishead and Massive
Attack numbers. There is also a  cover  of Black Steel which is hugely
superior to the original. A dark and mesmeric album, hated by managers
of Woolworths up and down  the  country  (presumably for lines such as
"I'll fuck you in the ass/just  for  a laugh" these West Country types
eh?). Effortless genius.

4. BANCO DE GAIA - LAST TRAIN TO LHASA

Banco de gaia means "Bank of  the  world"  -  but fear not this is not
music for accountants, but  perhaps  the  highest  quality ambient dub
Planet Dog have ever produced. I have to also recommend 1994's "Maya",
perhaps the best album of  last  year.  This  continues with a similar
formula, except over a triple album  set  -  over  3 hours of Mr. Toby
Marks at his best - Yowsa! Describing  the songs doesn't do justice to
them - if I  say  they  are  a  collection  of chanting, train noises,
quotes  from  chinese  folk  tales  you   have  the  right  to  remain
unimpressed, but these are married to killer tunes with sweeping synth
waves that are really uplifting. Even  if you can't afford this album,
it is worth breaking the bank(o) to get it!

5. BT - IMA

Not, as the title may suggest,  an  album  full of telephone sounds or
Bob Hoskins crooning "Its good to talk",  but a heavenly dose of post-
handbag house from Brian Transeau.  Although containing only 5 tracks,
with one being over 42 minutes  you  certainly get value for money. BT
ropes in top DJ and best mate  Sasha to create "Sasha's voyage of Ima"
a huge mix which contains some recent  BT singles. As you would expect
from a christian, the whole  album  contains  a very up Moby-like vibe
with dancefloor oriented home listening. The only time it threatens to
descend into cheese is during "Loving  you  more", but apart from that
it is trans-cendent. IMA-culate.

6. SPRING HEEL JACK - THERE ARE STRINGS

Whilst Goldie stole all the  headlines  messrs  Coxon and Wales proved
there was more to Jungle  music  than   just  flashy teeth. One of the
main criticisms of jungle has been  "its  all very well, but where are
the tunes?" which although unfair, does  have some basis in truth. SHJ
however have the tunes in abundance, and  in "Lee Perry Part One" have
created the first jungle tune  that  your  granny  can humm along too.
This album features some excellent  tracks,  not  true searing dum 'n'
bass but with more emphasis on  melody and tunesmithery. The Jacksters
have created the Jungle album of the year.

7. AUTECHRE - TRI REPEATE

Autechre have been threating to make  a fantastic album for five years
now. There debut "Incunubala" and  "Amber"  had some brilliant tracks,
but lacked overall cohesion. Tri Repeate  is  a bold step forward that
confirms all the faith we had in them, and is the best album Sheffield
label Warp have put out all year. There are no describably tunes, just
over an hour  of  headfuck  from  the  ex-hip-hoppers. Encore, encore,
encore!


8. MOBY - EVERYTHING IS WRONG

Moby is apparently related to that famous  huge whale and thats how he
got his name  (or  something).  He  also  thinks  that  "Everything is
wrong", fortunately his tunesmithery is still spot on from the opening
piano led "Hymn" through hi-NRG classics such as "Feeling so real" and
"everytime you touch me" to  the  sublime  "into  the blue" this is an
eclectic album of the highest order. But ignore the free ambient album
"Underwater" - it is arse. Everything else is right.

9. THE FALL - CEREBRAL CAUSTIC

She is back! No Mark E. Smith hasn't had a sex change, but his ex-wife
Brix returns to the  fall  stable  to  inject  some  life into the old
troopers after last year's stale  "Middle  Class Revolt". From the pop
thrills of "Don't  Call  Me  Darling",  "Life  Just  Bounces" and "The
Aphid" to the baffling  "North  West  Fashion  Show" ("Here's Hugh the
sheep-shagger, from Bolton)  there  is  something  for  everyone (well
every Fall fan at least). The almost unlistenable "Bonkers In Phoenix"
is  another  highlight  that  manages   to  faithfully  replicate  the
sensation of fingers being scratched down a blackboard. Awesome.

10. BLACK GRAPE - ITS GREAT WHEN YOU'RE STRAIGHT....YEAH

Shaun Ryder is now straight  -  toxicologically speaking. If you don't
count the brandies, or whiskies,  or  guinness  or the grass. But does
the world want a straight talking sensible Ryder? I think not. Here we
have lyrics that  even  Black  Grape  don't  understand  welded to the
expert production skilles  of  Danny  Saber  -  an  intoxicating blend
indeed. The result is like the Happy Mondays, but good. Micheal Howard
will be  tearing  his  hair  out  at  the  advocation  of  the  use of
tamazipan. The rest of us will just  be  enjoying tunes such as "A big
day in the north" and "Shake your  money" with a big grin. Even Carlos
the Jackal approves.


11. DAVID HOLMES - THIS FILMS CRAP LETS SLASH THE SEATS

Not just content with creating  the  best  album  title of 1995, David
Holmes shows he can deliver the  goods  as  a  songwriter as well as a
remixer. The opening chimes draw you into  an album of acid 303 techno
squelches and  thumping  trance,  the  highlight  being  the fantastic
"Minus 61 in Detroit" which  is  so  good  even  ITV  are using it for
advertising trailers. And when are they ever wrong?

12. GOLDIE - TIMELESS

Goldie has moved from underground jungle pioneer to this year's coffee
table cause celebre. This not  such  a  bad  thing  as the many (often
racist) cynics had declared jungle a  passing fad with no future. They
were wrong, and Goldie ritually humiliates them with a storming double
album. It has the familar  chart-friendly  "Inner City Life", but this
just scratches the surface  of  the  man.  Elsewhere  the "riddims are
ruffer" as I believe they say in  Jungle circles. Not all of it works,
and there are  better  Junglists  out  there  who  don't  get the same
attention as Goldie, but it is still a fine album - well worth getting
if just for the sublime "Sea of Tears".

13. SPEEDY J - G.SPOT

Trance is often much maligned,  but  when  done  well it can be hugely
entertaining and few do it  better  than  Holland's Jochan Pap, better
known as Speedy J. His debut  "Ginger"  had some fine moments, but did
suffer a bit  from  overprogramming.  G-Spot  is  more  improvised and
demonstrates a new  more  confident  direction.  My personal favourite
track is "The Oil Zone", the  newest  piece on here, and also recently
released a single. This album really hits the spot.

14. BLACK DOG - PARALLEL

The sad demise The Black Dog was one of the lowlights of 1995. The had
long been pioneers, melding hip-hop  and  techno and inspiring artists
over here and in detroit.  There  recent  work "Spanners" was arguably
there most complete to date, but sadly it will be there last. Parallel
is a collection of unreleased  material  from  their  GPR days back in
1993, and whilst  not  having  the  sparkle  and  innovation  of, say,
"Bytes" or "Spanners" it goes in a  more melodic direction. Its a good
album, some non dog fans say their best, but it just goes to show that
their Bark is worse than their "Bytes".

15. CHEMICAL BROTHERS - EXIT PLANET DUST

"The Brothers Gonna Work It out"  club goers worldwide must be familar
with this sample as Tom  and  Ed  lead  a  hectic  life of club dates.
Although they are  both  graduates  from  Manchester University, their
music is anything but subtle - a thundering bassline is the first item
they put into  any  musical  recipe.  As  remixers  they have injected
welcome life into many tired singles,  but  an album full of the stuff
is stretching their formula a bit thin. Fortunately they have roped in
some help and the likes of  Tim  Burgess  from the Charlatans and Beth
from Portishead lend there vocal  talents  giving  the album a broader
appeal.

16. KENNY LARKIN - METAPHOR

"Larko! Larko!" go the football  like  chants  of  the  fans of one of
detroits finest. Metaphor is his latest album on R&S, the follow up to
his release on Warp, and this  is an altogether more consistent piece.
Ken recovers from a shooting to  deliver  BIG style! Baffling on first
listen, "Metaphor"  metamorphosises  into  an  album  full  of geniune
delights. Korking.

17. PULP - DIFFERENT CLASS

If any band has done anything to justify the hype surrounding Britpop,
it is Pulp who have  been  dragged  into  the  genre as rather bemused
outsiders. Pulp, lest we forget, have  been  going for about a decade,
but let's face it, their  early  work  was  pretty  naff and it wasn't
until last years "His N  Hers"  did  they  produce and albums worth of
decent material. Cocker and the lads (and  lass) have kept up the same
high standard on Different  Class  with  storming  hits such as "Disco
2000" and "Common People" shining  like  jewels.  The thing that makes
Pulp stand out from the rest of the Britpop crowd is there willingness
to try something new  -  instead  of  just  doffing  their caps to the
Beatles and nicking all  their  tunes  (a  la  Oasis)  - they have the
ability  to  make  there  own  tunes  and  bring  in  some  technology
(keyboards!). Although some riffs (especially  the  one on Disco 2000)
are  very  familiar  Cocker  carries   everything  off  with  his  own
distinctive style. Plus he's  a  Sheffield  Wednesday  fan - different
class indeed.

18. JAKE SLAZENGER - MAKESARACKET

Mike "Mu-Ziq" Paradinas  powers  up  his  ST  and  switches  into easy
listening techno mode with  his  Jake  Slazenger  alter  ego. From the
opening whistleable "Megaphonk" to the  exellent  "Erp" this are tunes
with, er, a tune. Only  on  Flod  does  it decend into a predectiable,
formulaic blodge. As you would  expect  from  a  mate of Richard James
there are numerous  dodgy  song  titles  ("Stupid  Wankers")  and some
wierdness, but more melody than in  recent aphex releases. Jake may be
making a racket, but it a  racket  well  worth listening to. Game, Set
and Match Mr. Paradinas.

19. RICHARD H. KIRK - THE NUMBER OF MAGIC

Sheffield's Richard H. "Captain"  Kirk  is  one  of  the most prolific
techno songwriters. Not content  with  being  the guiding force behind
80s pioneers Cabaret Voltaire,  he  also  records  under a plethora of
pseudonyms as well as releasing  work  bearing his name. Following the
cabs return to glory in 1994 (with the magnificent "The Conversation")
and the tremendous "Virtual  State"  on  Warp,  Kirk  visits India and
returns with a bag full of tunes. There is the obligatory estern chant
samples, and some tracks  tend  to  meander,  but  when he can deliver
stormers such as "Atomic" who cares? Warp factor nine!

20. APHEX TWIN - I CARE BECAUSE YOU DO

Possibly the most misconcieved album  title  of the year, conjuring up
images of Mike Flowers  Pops  style  easy  listening  when really this
contains another dose  of  Aphex  aural  attack.  This  is  a merciful
departure from 1994's double album snoozeathon "Selected Ambient Works
vol 2" and  the  beard  is  back  to  his  best.  The  song titles are
ridiculous as ever ("Moo Kid", "Wax the nip", "Cow cud is a twin") and
veers from the unlistenable rasping of  Ventolin (a tribute to asthma)
to the classically inspired "Icct Hedral".  In "Come On You Slags" the
Brady Bunch are sampled with inspiring  chants of "Come On You Slags".
Excellent. As with most Aphex releases there  is a fair slice of arse,
and you get the  feeling  he  is  laughing  at  you.  But when he does
deliver you get the feeling that yes, he really does care.

21. MASSIVE ATTACK VS MAD PROFESSOR - NO PROTECTION

Bristol's second finest get  the  dub  treatment  in this remix album.
This is basically all the tracks  from "Protection" stripped of vocals
and dubbed up in  the  best  Lee  "Stratch"  Perry  tradition and is a
testament as much to the  Mad  Professor's  skills  as that of Massive
Attack. Turn up the bass....booooyyy (oops wrong genre!)

22. GENE - OLYMPIAN

Indie intruders make Maggie best album chart shocker! Gene have a fine
grasp of tune-smith-ery, so much so you  feel at times that they are a
Morrissey  and  Marr  covers  band.   Lead  singer  Martin  Rossiter's
posturing is  so  similar  to  Stephen  Patrick's  he  has  earned the
nickname "Roz". Having subjected him  to  an intensive interview I can
report he is just as pretentious. But  with tunes such as "Truth, Rest
Your Head" even La Moz with  have  to  give  them a respectful nod. In
guitarist Steve Mason they have  the  new  Paul  Weller, and they also
have the ugliest drummer in rock  (since the guy from the housemartins
is now in prison for murder).  Shove  some  daffodils up your arse and
put on Olympian - the 80s revival here we come.

23. FLUKE - OTO

Fluke go for the Underwold tip  on  this  8 tracker, and although they
don't come up  to  the  Hyde/Emerson  standard,  they  still produce a
newtons cradle full  of  beezer  tunes.  Highlights  include  the rant
against 80s consumerism "Tosh"  which  manages  to namecheck Jim Bowen
and Super Mario. There main strength  is  still the thumping trance of
O.K., but this album's genius is no fluke.

24. WAGON CHRIST - THROBBING POUCH

Luke  "West  Country"  Vibert  makes  a  pleasing  depature  from  the
mimimilism of "Phat  Lab  Nightmare"  and  strolls  into the jazz-funk
territory of Black dog.  Very  laid  back,  you  probably need copious
amounts of soft drugs to  enjoy  it  to  the full, it still emphasises
this mans diverse talents,  as  his  current project delivers storming
drum and bass tracks.

25. SABRES OF PARADISE - SABRESONIC II

Andy Wetherall is one of the most  famous blokes in dance music today,
and having shaken his hand  at  a  gig  in  Liverpool I fell eminently
qualified  to  dissect  his   entire   career.  Making  Primal  Scream
listenable (by producing "Screamadelica") is  a  testament to the mans
ability. He helped shape One Dove's fantastic "Morning White Dove" and
since then has concentrated on his  band, clubs and record labels. The
Sabres have delivered  a  consistent  amount  of  huge  tunes and have
drifted into the mainstream  so  much  that  you  will frequently hear
their tracks on movies, trailers  and  even  Radio  4 plays (I kid you
not). Unfortunately this  album  is  just  a  touch-up  of  1993's now
deleted debut,  "Sabresonic". Those of you  who have the original will
probably give this a miss as  it  contains all the same tracks. Tacked
on the end is a phenonemal  mix  of Smokebelch by David Holmes, almost
worth the asking price alone, and the beatless mix of Smokebelch II is
still the finest anti-cja tune about.

26. HARDFLOOR - RESPECT

Oliver Bondzio and Ramon  Zenker  get  out  their  303s and release an
album worth of typical Hardfloor fare.  This album has its highlights,
but is somewhat marred by  the  duo  sticking  rather rigidly to their
formula. Perhaps best suited to  the  dancefloor,  this album would be
much improved by some changes  in  tone  and  tempo and has a clinical
feel, certainly the accusation that  European dance music doesn't have
the soul of is American counterpart  is  furthered by this release. No
track comes close to the 303 rush of this year's "Access" by DJ Mishra
and Mr. Tim, but it still has its moments.


27. RED SNAPPER - REELED AND SKINNED

Made up by ex-members of Sabres of Paradise and The Aloof, "Reeled And
Skinned" is a collection of Red Snappers  EPs. They are on a jazz-tip,
but contain enough substance to keep  capuccino free listening. Add to
this the vocal skills of Beth Orton  and the behind the desk wizard of
Andy Wetherall and you have a fine release.

28. SEEFEEL - SUCCOUR

Ambience with guitars and wailing! At times slow and painful, but when
they do hit their peak,  Seefeel  can really shine. Unfortunately they
don't do it consistently  enough,   still   a   pleasent  album with a
cool periodic  table  design  on  the  cover   (and  if  that  doesn't
encourage you to buy it...)

29. SABRES OF PARADISE - VERSUS

Warp continue to milk their highest  profile release, even though they
have now split up. This is a pretty  sorry affair - a remix album with
only six tracks,  3  of  them  being  remixes  of  Tow  Truck. Haunted
Dancehall was their weakest album to date,  and remixes of some of the
lesser tracks  from  this  album,  albeit  by  Depth  Charge, Chemical
brothers and LFO, do not whet the appetite.



So there you have it kids!  Buy  these  albums and your life will be
complete - at least until the next Warp release!
