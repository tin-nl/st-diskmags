Eye on Scene II
===============

Upon booting up this disk, you're presented with a simple plasma / 
fractal type intro accompanied by a familiar chip music tune.  The intro 
is pretty short and basically tells you the name of the diskmagazine, 
and the chaps behind it.  Namely, The Admirables.  A quick bash of the 
Spacebar, and I was onto the desktop ready to load the magazine itself.

This is where I had a few problems, to begin with I couldn't even get 
the program to run at all, however, after renaming a file, I finally 
reached the menu.  However, when I tried to load a file it displayed 
nothing, because apparently my text buffer was empty.  So I had a fiddle 
with the built in options, and eventually got the thing up and running.  
Maybe the programmers could make it easier to do in future issues, by 
just including a simple menu when the magazine is first run, so that 
everything can be set up simply and easily.  I have a feeling that 
other, less determined people may have given up.

Anyway, when I did get the menu running properly, it was accompanied by 
a tracker module playing in the background, (although I don't know if 
this is the case on all ST's?).  There are also a selection of other 
modules on the disk which you can change the tune to, if you don't like 
the one that's playing.  The menu itself is pretty similar to that of 
the first issue with all the article names bouncing up and down to a 
sine wave.  The background picture made the text a little difficult to 
read, especially on T.V's and when scrolling through the article names, 
it scrolled a little too fast at times, jumping over the one you 
intended to select.

Article-wise, the zine is okay.  As the title suggests, this diskmag is 
an 'Eye on' the Atari 'Scene', with scene news, contacts, programming 
tips and other such material.  There are also various netgrabs, some 
better than others.  The Terrorists Handbook in particular (in my 
opinion) is a bit of a dubious inclusion.  There are enough fools and 
idiots out there as it is.  

There are also various opinions and reviews.  A demo, Golden Dawn disks, 
Stosser and Obsession along with a few videos all get the going over, 
and there are various other bits and bobs including an interview and 
stuff.

Overall, there are about 36 articles there with about 588k's worth of 
text on the disk (when unpacked), 273k ish (when packed).  Without the 
Terrorists Handbook articles, a good bit of space could have been freed 
up for decent articles, as it is though, a lot of the disk is taken up 
with the modules, which I suppose is fine if you like modules.

As regards the displayer itself, its fast enough, with some nice 
options, but did tend to crash occasionally.  Apart from a couple of 
gripes, a decent zine.


Topological Interests Issue I
=============================

The first diskmag outing from Tronic of Effect along with Locum of 
Sublime, is the interestingly entitled Topological Interests.  

Booting up, you are presented with a simple intro screen, explaining 
what the disk-mag is etc... and a quick press of the space bar and 
straight into the main menu of the disk-mag.  The shell used is the very 
same that was used in Issue 18 of Stosser and given away for all to use.  
It's programmed in Stos by Tony Greenwood, so will more than likely 
bugger up on the Falcon.  A similar shell was also used for the first 
issue of the Golden Dawn diskmag.

Selecting an article is simple enough, you just use the cursor keys to 
scroll through the article names, then when the one you want is 
highlighted press space, and after a short wait the article appears. 

The text displayer is fast, and features loads of options.  It's 
probably not as fast as some other diskmags though.  Still, with a bit 
of tweaking, you can change this shell and use it for your own 
publications.  In that sense, the scrolling is much faster than anything 
else in the same vein.  You only have to look at ST-Zine for a 
comparison.  Incidentally, there is now an even newer version of the 
shell which allows the inclusion of even more options, and has even 
better scrolling.

Article wise, TI 1 is a bit of a mix of stuff, mainly consisting of text 
files taken from the Internet or off BBS's.  For Simpsons fans there are 
FAQ's, episode guides and more.  Star Trek fans get episode guides, 
scripts and issues of Dateline Starfleet.  For Babylon 5 there are FAQ's 
and an episode guide, there are also scripts for Alien 3 and 
Bladerunner, FAQ's for Aliens, Bladerunner and Terminator 2, along with 
stuff for Star Wars fans.  There are also some spoilers for Hellraiser 
4.  Tagged along at the end is some snippets on UFO's and a bit of 
devilish stuff.

All in all there is over 1.2 megs worth of text on the disk (when it is 
unpacked).   It's obviously aimed at fans of The Simpsons and Science 
Fiction, so if you like neither, then this disk is probably not your 
thing.  It will be interesting to see what sort of combination the chaps 
will come up with next time round.  I'm not sure that the present one 
works?.  All in all, I liked half of this one, but not the other.

Oops, before I forget, there are also a few Star Trek .Gif files on the 
disk to fill it up too.  


Nova 8
======

Another sci-fi diskmag fest.  This one is the 8th issue which has been 
put together by James Bird?.  There is no fancy intro or anything on 
this, it's straight to the desktop and double click on the program file 
(after reading the 'Readme' of course.

After a rather nicely done intro piccy, you're presented with the main 
menu.  Selecting an article is easy, you just use the cursors to go up 
and down the list then space to select the one you want.  Whilst you 
wait for your article to load, the Federation of Planets seal appears on 
screen urging you to wait.

The displayer is competant enough, with all main options included.  It's 
not overly quick at loading or with the scrolling, although I did notice 
that if you used the mouse button to scroll through the articles the 
speed increased a fair bit.  There's also a built in screen saver for 
when you go for a cuppa whilst one of the screens is on.  The displayer 
features most of the most important options needed, and most of the 
articles have Spectrum pictures accompanying them, these can be viewed 
without exiting the displayer by pressing the F keys.  Various samples 
also play when certain keys are depressed.

This issue is a bit of a Babylon 5 special apparently, although almost 
all of the graphics and most of the text files were Star Trek based.  
There is a good general mix though.  For Babylon 5, there is a season 
guide, radio interview, news and a parody script.  If Star Trek is your 
thang, then there are more episode guides for Voyager and Deep Space 
Nine.  The Second part of a Star Trek/Quantum Leap story, plus various 
book, magazine and video info and reviews, along with a few snippets of 
convention stuff.  

I must admit though, that there isn't a great deal here, much of the 
disk is taken up with the Spectrum pictures which vary in quality from 
Very Good to Very Poor.  All in all, a pretty good zine, which has been 
going for quite a while now.
