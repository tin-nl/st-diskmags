

                    In a Future issue near you..


Uummm,  tricky  tricky  tricky,.  always a problem trying to guess 
what might make it into the next issue, but I suppose we've got to 
give it a go, if only to keep our present readers interested..

                  **ISSUE 20 - A BLANK SPACE!!**

Not really..


         **ISSUE 20 - A BLANK SPACE WITH SOME NICE MUSIC!!**


Try again, try again..


                    **ISSUE 20 (hopefully)**
Reports  on  the  following,  the Fried Bits 4 event,  or is  that 
Symposium '96,  I'm really going to try to get out there,  barring 
bankruptcy, high water, measles etc.. 

More  new  and  exciting  games,   including  the  revived  Falcon 
Obsession,  more  on  this 'Doom' clone for the Falcon,  new games 
from  Top  Byte,  Merlin and Village Software for both Falcon  and 
ST.. There should be some of the long awaited 'new wave' of Jaguar 
games in there as well??

After  a  fairly  quiet  period,  a glut of  new  demos,  the  new 
Aggression production, 'Motion Blur' is an obvious candidate which 
could  go either way whether it is featured in issue 19 or  20  of 
Maggie..

The New F.O.G. CD-ROM considered..

The usual, that is various humourous jottings from the team in the 
style that you have come to love and enjoy!!

The '1984-style' Microsoft parody continues..

Any  misdeeds  by  the above company faithfully  reported  on,  er 
reproduced in these pages!!

The rest of it,  well,  it'll come together a bit nearer the time, 
won't it..


                    (**In an even later issue**)
The long-delayed visit to Richard Karsmakers in the Netherlands to 
commemorate the final issue of ST-News??

 CiH - Dec '95..
