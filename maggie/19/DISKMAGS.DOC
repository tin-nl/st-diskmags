CiH of MI5 and a half back yet again to blab,  snitch,  sneak, and 
generally  tell all on what is happening in the exciting world  of 
Atari diskmags..

Lots  to  write  about as well,  we see not one,  but two new  DBA 
issues,  albeit  one  of these (no.  13) released as a compilation 
issue..  ST  News  10.2  of course,  with several others  not  far 
behind..

Of these,  we see the continuing development of Warp magazine, the 
Trekkers favourite,  into a third fiction packed issue, and Skynet 
Times reaches issue seven with a tad more to offer in the original 
articles department than previously,  including the first printing 
of the Maggie party realtime textfile in any publication..    

Of  further  interest were a bunch of German diskmags dug  up  off 
various  CD-ROMs  which were either Falcon  specific,  or  heavily 
Falcon tilted, but all mainly in the German language, and in terms 
of shell program quality, not quite up to the prevailing standards 
of either DBA mag,  or the new Falcon Maggie shells..  (Sorry, but 
it had to be said!)

Further news later on in this textfile may well include details of 
a  interesting departure for RiCH Davey of FOG and  Falcon  Update 
issue  10,  and  a new diskmag project being started by Tronic  of 
whatever group he is in at this moment in time.. 

For now though, we kick off with..
 
                     Skynet Times Issue 7

John  (VoGue)  is a clever chap,  not only did he make it  to  the 
Maggie party,  where others (James Mathews) failed, but he managed 
to bring an almost finished (90% complete) edition of Skynet Times 
with him for us to enjoy.. 

The  now,  100% issue of Skynet Times issue 7 was released shortly 
after, and presents itself for reviewing purposes..

On the visuals front,  (the shell),  little change from last time, 
it is still the Toms shell of past infamy, but hacked around a bit 
more  conclusively to work on Falcon this time,  for it manages to 
go on the '030, without dying horribly three seconds later..

Article  wise sees some improvement from last time,  with  several 
original  writings (hooray!) from John,  including some very close 
to  events in August..  A comprehensive review of several disk and 
paper mags, the Falcon Maggie shell gets its own special chapter.. 
The  full unadulterated text of the Maggie Party realtime  article 
alone,  makes  this  a  must issue,  at least until this issue  of 
Maggie hits the streets! John also follows up with his own view of 
that  weekends'  events,  an  interview  with Mr  Pink  (Leon)  of 
Reservoir Gods is another highlight.. Some other mixed reviews and 
PD lisitings follow,  but these are kept in proportion to the rest 
of the mag this time..

The 'Goodies' folder contains some embarrassing,  er,  interesting 
material  digitised  from the Maggie 5th Birthday  party  by  Apex 
Media, and greyscaled down for use by people with ST's..

Generally,  a  nice  little issue,  one of the better ones he  has 
done.. Can it get still better though?

Summary:-  Comes on one D/S disk,  the inevitable Toms shell,  but 
this  time  it  works on the Falcon,  hooray..  Mainly a  one  man 
creation, but with a heavy input from the Maggie Party, this could 
almost be an official souvenir issue of the Maggie Party in fact.. 
More substantial in content than previous issues,  which is no bad 
thing,  long  may  it continue..  Nice humourous touches from  the 
editor, VoGue, are scattered throughout..

Overall, 6.75889 out of ten!

                               Warp 3 

And Keefy once more strikes..

Issue  three  of  Warp  continues the Star  Trek  theme  of  these 
diskmags, with yet another new menu, will this boy ever run out of 
menu ideas, and if he does, will this be the end of the mag??

This  time around,  we get a long menu bar type thing with maybe a 
couple of dozen or so neatly hand-drawn sixteen colour  depictions 
of  a  head  and shoulders profile of just  about  all  the  major 
characters from the four 'Trek inspired series..  These range from 
the  original  series and Next 'Gen,  where you can recognise  the 
faces,  to  several  total  strangers  in  Starfleet  uniform  who 
populate  the  title credits for Deep Space  Nine  and  'Voyager.. 
Clicking  on  one of these will get you into an  article,  with  a 
suitable  sampled noise..  Soundchip music having been  mercifully 
kept away..  The menu bar is a horizontal entity which goes on for 
several screens in width, making Warp possibly, the widest diskmag 
on the Atari scene..

The shell is STOS flavoured, meaning that once more, a nasty taste 
is  left in the mouth of my Falcon when it tries to chew  on  it.. 
However,  the usual depacker is enclosed as part of the kit to get 
to the meat of the textfiles..  Warp 2 even had a letter from a PC 
owner  who only got to see Warp that way,  and wondered about a PC 
version being made..

Textually speaking, probably the best issue yet, although Keefy is 
not totally happy as to the reasons why..

Quite  a lot of magazine is devoted to several serialised  stories 
written by (mostly) high quality amateur writers,  which makes for 
several  hours high value reading enjoyment..  Keefy is nonchuffed 
though,  as the bulk of these were obtained by Tony Greenwood with 
a   modem   from   the  wide  expanse   of   'Net,   courtesy   of 
'blaggedtext@lazyeditor.demon.co.uk' or something very similar.. 

A  Keefy  production  just isn't the  same  without  an  editorial 
bemoaning  the  lack of reader contributions,  and threatening  to 
shut  up shop if things don't improve!  It would be a shame if  it 
did  though,  as much of the material in this issue made very good 
reading.. My own assessment is that Keefy should continue, even if 
reader  contributions don't reach the level he is seeking,  as the 
inclusion  of several very good stories is one of those very  rare 
occasions that 'net grabbing is justified..

Although  these  files  may  be  available  to  experienced  Modem 
jockeys,  many  people still do not own a modem,  or know where to 
look  for  this kind of stuff,  even if they do,  so a high qality 
diskmag format,  easily spread through other PD routes makes quite 
a lot of sense..

It  might  help if you are a regular and  appreciative  reader  of 
Warp, to perhaps communicate this to Keefy, he may like you rather 
a lot for doing this!

Summary:-  Comes  as a single D/S disk..  Yet another  STOS  based 
custom shell,  and probably the easiest and neatest one yet.. High 
quality 'third party' net grabbed contents, mainly fictional, with 
much to feast the eyes on..  Editor could do with encouragement to 
continue, which he definitely should..

Overall,  eight  out  of ten,  and this is a real rating,  not just 
tweaked for Trekker sensibilities..


                         DBA issue 13 

The  latest arrival from Slimer and company makes a noisy  arrival 
on  my  doorstep  loudly  announcing  it  wants  to  be  read  and 
reviewed..

Issue 13 is a bit of a holiday for the Diskbuster team, as this is 
to  be a compilation issue of the last three issues,  namely  ten, 
eleven and twelve.. We learn that issue fourteen, 'due real soon', 
is  to be the next 'proper' issue with up to the  minute  articles 
and assorted Dutch wisdom to enrich our world with.. 

Therefore  there  is  nothing really new to remark  on  about  the 
contents,  it  is interesting to re-read some of the older  stuff, 
which was written in 1993-4,  and even includes the realtime texts 
from  various  early  Falcon events including the  Fried  Bits  II 
party.. This issue is quite packed out with text in fact, and is a 
worthwhile substitute for the older issues, if you had not already 
got these..

The menu continues with the new Falcon enhanced look first  hinted 
at in issue eleven,  and reaching maturity in issue twelve..  This 
time  around,  a more grisly and heavy metal album cover main menu 
style,  with the usual mixture of nice background textures for the 
texts, a decent choice of music of a multichannel ilk too..

Not too bad,  but still looking forward to seeing issue fourteen a 
bit more..

Summary:-  Comes  on  two  H/D disks,  with  a  very  much  Falcon 
enhanced,  indeed, Falcon only menu, yumm, yum, yumm!! Compilation 
of  three previous issues,  which is ok,  if a little too soon for 
some issue twelve articles to be aired again perhaps..  This seems 
to  be  a  space filler until issue 14,  the  next  'full'  issue, 
arrives..

Overall, about seven out of ten.. Nice music..
  

                       DBA Issue 14 

Following quite hard on the heels of issue thirteen, here it is..

Issue  fourteen  is the first new issue for a little  while..  The 
groundbreaking  issue  twelve has been around a  while  and  gone, 
issue  13,  reviewed above is a compilation issue and a handy  and 
cheap  way of keeping DBA in the market,  so to speak..  Now issue 
fourteen is here, and shows that quite a lot of work has gone into 
it.. 

To start with,  there is a very nice intro demo by Lazer,  written 
specially  for the mag,  and has a few very modish and  impressive 
effects,   starting   with  a  3-D  motion  blurred  plasma-mapped 
lettering,  and  ending with a lovely rippling seaweed plasma type 
effect.. Very good..

To the mag itself,  and the basic DBA shell is customised in a new 
and sinister direction as the startup from a totally different and 
menacing operating system looms up..  Yes, this is the DBA version 
of  Windows for the Falcon,  otherwise known as MicroBox Windows.. 
You  even  get  the tinny 'ta-da' chord that  announces  all  your 
system  resources  are  gobbled up by this  pig  of  an  operating 
system..  Inside the main mag shell, it does not get any better as 
we  are treated to more of the wonderful world that is  a  certain 
well-known proprietary operating system for the PC.. Okay, not too 
bad,  as  it  does  work  quickly and smoothly,  and  hiding  just 
underneath the pock-marked and hideous exterior,  the good old DBA 
menu shell is doing its thing,  excellently as always..  Actually, 
this  last  paragraph was laying it on a bit thick,  as this is  a 
rather good piss-take of Windows done by DBA..

The  text-displayer is as before,  totally smooth,  professionally 
executed, and limited to 18 pages maximum.. Music is four modfiles 
again, and with a wide variety of styles, all of it good..

This  has  a  good range of reading matter,  although it  feels  a 
little  bit  lighter  than previous  issues..  Having  said  that, 
certain  topics are over-familiar to this reviewer,  including the 
entire  Maggie 5th Birthday Party realtime text,  but should be an 
'entertaining'  read for most people..  Scene coverage,  as in the 
movements of various demo crews is well covered as usual, with the 
Falcon  scene  encyclopaedia  kept up to date (as up  to  date  as 
possible,  anyway..)  Reviews  of various things,  including  some 
computer material, various films, videos and music are included..

One  scoop,  if  such a word is still in use,  is their interviews 
section,   which  is  taken  up  with  interviews  of  the  entire 
membership  of Lazer..  As with anyone else who gets access to the 
'net, the latter day church of UFO text files has left its calling 
card with a section dedicated to these.. Opinions, nonsense (where 
this reviewer left his calling card!) and even some Jaguar reviews 
join  in..  I get the sense that Slimer is getting more depth  and 
character in his own personal writing style, earlier issues of DBA 
tended to be a little bland, and lack self expression, but now, we 
are   getting   a  more  personal  and   expressive   style   from 
Slimer.. Evidently, the self-teaching of English is paying off!!

I  liked this issue of DBA,  and not just because we like  Slimer, 
and  have contributed to this issue,  or because that a slick  and 
good looking shell is included, or a good choice of articles is on 
offer, or...

Summary:-  Comes on two H/D disks once more,  the shell is  Falcon 
specific,  with  a serious attempt to disguise this by lending the 
look of the beast that is called 'Windows' to it.. Ok if you treat 
it  as  part  of  the Dutch sense of  humour  and  don't  take  it 
literally..   Articles   a  good  mix  of  quality  writings   and 
reflections  on the Falcon scene,  and other assorted topics  that 
happen to catch the editor's eye at the time..  A bit smaller than 
some previous issues, but still plenty to get through.. High hopes 
for DBA fifteen.. 

Overall, about eight and a half out of ten.. Another good 'un!


                        ST News 10.2 

And at last,  another one joins us before the year terminates.. We 
cheer loudly..

Richard K.  is back,  and ST-News is more blue,  and GEM-like than 
ever..  As always the contents outweigh everything else,  with the 
'three  'zines  in  one'  approach  that  has  characterised  past 
issues.. This time, a bit more welcome weight is given to the 'ST' 
side  of  things,  as some articles which were bludgeoned off  the 
Karsmakers hard drive last time,  crying faintly, are back.. A big 
input, and therefore, a fresh perspective is seen from third party 
writers  on  this  side,   including  previous  'Maggie'  alumini, 
alright,  the  ST-News staff writing team of Mike Noyce and  Kevin 
Davies..  

Reviews and sideways looks at life on the ST follow including such 
items  of direct interest as a report on the Maggie  5th  Birthday 
party  and reviews of 'Double Bobble' among others..  The diskzine 
review  is  brought  up to date (as possible),  and the  issue  is 
dedicated  to  the mysterious virus programmer known  formerly  as 
the (un)Lucky Lady, and no longer of this world..

The interviews section includes one Dave 'Sten' Mooney who has now 
well  and truly departed to the world of the PC..  One interesting 
and  slightly  hilarious  response was to  the  question  what  he 
thought  of 'Maggie' (the diskmag,  this diskmag indeed!) where he 
sounded  off  at length about the former prime  minister  of  that 
name..  A mistake,  or intentional perhaps?? He was never really a 
fan  of Maggie,  at least Maggie as produced in the old days,  and 
wanted to keep his views to himself what he thought of us??

A large swathe of music stuff, miscellaneous film and book reviews 
are  all  in  as well,  and a large fictional section  (the  third 
'zine)  which  includes  the second excellent  installment  of  'A 
Bloodless Coup',  another rather good war story of what might have 
happened  if  the first Atomic bomb failed,  and the  invasion  of 
Japan  had  gone ahead after all,  and even the very final  Cronos 
Warchild story..

All  of it rendered spotlessly by the awesomely efficient  Richard 
Karsmakers editorial machine!!  (Well actually, the delays, mainly 
due  to a buildup of various personal reasons make him look a  lot 
more  fallible  and human to those people who need  convincing  at 
least..)  He  really is a nice bloke (not written with a  note  of 
surprise!)

What  more is there to say!!  Well there are not many more to come 
now, after July next year, that will be all from them! Get it now, 
and savour it whilst you can..

Summary:- Comes on one pre-stressed case-hardened D/S floppy  disk 
that  can take loads of tracks and sectors without breaking..  The 
same old shell,  which is having a birthday at about the same time 
as the queen mum,  but no point in changing it now..  Contents the 
usual  mix  of high quality writings on assorted  topics,  with  a 
higher proportion computer related than usual..

Overall,  eight and a half out of ten,  a part of the staple Atari 
reading diet that should not be neglected.. (Your Doctor says..)


               Various other German publications..

Some other mags grabbed off CD-ROM briefly considered here..

I  came across three publications I have not seen much of  before, 
and didn't really get to establish a systematic realationship with 
now.. 

Of these, the Undercover Magazines were technically the best, with 
a  very nice custom shell that supported both ST  and  (allegedly) 
Falcon.. A multi-choice in modfile soundtracks were available, and 
a  very  efficient  gallery function for the  display  of  various 
artwork were both included..  The style was a little reminscent of 
the DBA mag in their ST days..  Unfortunately,  the text-displayer 
bit chose not to co-operate with this particular Falcon, coming up 
with  an 'Illegal AES Call' as the excuse..  The majority of  text 
was  in  purest German,  although some issues did have an  English 
language  section with some original text,  and also some internet 
grabs as well..

'Atari Dream Machine',  another one which was German only,  with a 
ghastly  flicker-filled hi-res interlace text display..  This  one 
was  embedded with screenshots,  in the issue under consideration, 
of  a  computer show in Germany..  This was  Falcon-specific,  but 
nothing  for non-Germans to get too involved in,  and nothing  too 
special on the presentation front either..

'Sienera  Online',  another  hi-res monstrosity,  albeit  slightly 
better  looking,  with  proper  soundtracks built in,  a  graphics 
slideshow,  and  a  strange sort of animation/effects screen  that 
gives  a  taste of how a GEM programmer would do a  demo  screen?? 
This  one  seemed  to be a bit short on actual  text  and  with  a 
slightly  obscure keyboard only control system..  German only text 
again..

Summary:-  All came off the 'Transmission' CD-ROM,  and were a bit 
of a sod to deal with,  to be honest.. Also interestingly, the DBA 
issue 12 was found there, which DID work correctly, and Maggie 14, 
where the main magazine program worked fine,  but one of the items 
in  the  'goodies' section didn't!!  - Checking my  original  disk 
revealed  that  the  program concerned was ok  on  there,  so  the 
problems  with these publications seem to relate to the CD  rather 
than my Falcon.. Odd one that??

Overall:- forget it..

   Extra, extra, read all about it!!! - Other diskzine news..

Tronic gets the Power!!

Due to production difficulties and ever lengthening lead times for 
new  issues,  James Mathews has decided to call it a day for Power 
Diskzine..  After  issue  28,  provisionally a Christmas or end of 
year  issue,  James will hand over production of future issues  to 
Tronic of Effect and Kuba,  and whatever other groups he can think 
of  at  the  time..  Keep an eye out to see how this  will  change 
'Power, we certainly will!!

In a related move,  James is also winding up Power PD, in order to 
concentrate   exclusively  on  his  commercial  label,   Top  Byte 
Software..

RiCH gets new Falcon Shell!!

Sometime   after  this  topic  was  first  mentioned,   a  working 
demo/fully  finished version of the long awaited FOG Falcon  shell 
for  Falcon  Update  Digital  should  be  here..   The  programmer 
concerned is the same person who worked on the Psychosis slideshow 
demo,  previewed in issue 18,  and briefly mentioned in the Maggie 
Party  realtime  text..  With  RiCH working on   several  original 
articles  for this upcoming issue,  the finished product should be 
something really special when it finally arrives..

In another move, a future issue of Falcon Update may will come out 
in  paper  as some sort of deal with a friendly printer  has  been 
done?? More on this if possible??

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UK Distributor for Falcon coding mag..

You  may recall a review last issue of the (unregistered)  version 
of  the  Falcon shareware coding mag 'How to Code  3',  which  was 
produced by EKO, the famous French Falcon supremos..

Well,  it now has a UK distributor to send those registrations to, 
which is one   Michael James
                79 Norse Road
                 Glasgow G14 9EF

Also on the electronic ether on either mjames@grelb.src.gla.ac.uk
or
http:\\grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000\~mjames\computers\htc\

Got that??

Registration for the full version is œ7.50..

Whilst  we  are on the subject of diskmags,  I wonder if Mr  James 
knows  anything  about the fate of a certain  well-known  Scottish 
underground diskmag that goes by the initials 'PB'!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maggie Compo issue finally escapes.. Police called!!

In  an  unexpected  move,  sometime around the  first  weekend  of 
December,  'Maggie,  the  Best  of  Issues  1 to 11'  was  finally 
released to a stunned world..  Initial reactions were a mixture of 
horror and amazement,  but it went ahead anyway..  Seriously, this 
is  a  hand-picked body of textfiles from the  first  ten  issues, 
about  a meg's worth of text,  hopefully representing the best  of 
those early,  crazy days,  back when we were all young,  (and Leon 
was a foetus!)

Well we think that it is a reasonable cross-section of those early 
days,  with classic reviews, interviews, and the best of the funny 
stuff,  without  too  much of the naughty stuff,  although just  a 
little  of  that  did get in,  because the  early  Maggie  without 
naughty stuff is a bit like a duvet without a bed underneath  it.. 
Something missing,  in other words.. If the idea of a pocket-sized 
slab of Atari heritage being delivered to you appeals, then send a 
blank disk and SAE to the usual (new!) address..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keefy has reached Warp Four..

At the end of 1995,  the fourth issue of this well-known 'Trekmag' 
has  hit the streets..  The shell design is something very similar 
to  issue one,  but the contents carry on where they left off last 
issue..  The  large  number of stories is also balanced  out  with 
several  online  interviews  with characters from  the  show,  and 
several other unique features for the mag..

Treat  as  per issue three,  reviewed earlier,  in other words,  it 
comes highly recommended, but a tad Falcon-incompatible..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ST+ diskzine released..

A  fellow  editor toils but a few miles away in  darkest,  coldest 
Northampton  (Daytime  temperature  minus 2  Celcius  at  time  of 
writing on the 25th January - Phew!)

A new departure in general diskmags??

Well maybe,  as the debut issue of this new 'Stosser-type mag hits 
the   streets..   "Stosser-Type"  as  the  right  honourable  Tony 
Greenwood  has had quite a bit to do with the construction of  the 
shell.. The shell and text displayer are competent replicas of the 
established STOS-mag, the contents a wide, not to say wild mixture 
of  older  and  newer news,  reviews,  jokes,  opinions,  tips and 
stories,  many  of these relating to the Atari hardware in all its 
various forms.. Dave Hollis is the editing chap behind it all, and 
says  that he is learning new things all the time to put in  issue 
two..  As  he  was  involved in the 'Panther  Owners  Group',  the 
Frontier/Elite players diskmag, some material also relates to that 
game as well..

This looks like one that could be around for a while??

 Anyone wanting to know more can contact Dave at..

Skynet Times issue eight working towards some sort of conclusion?? 
At  least  the  front cover is ready!!  Also one or  two  original 
articles  not  half a million miles away from  someone  working  a 
Falcon keyboard now will appear as well!?

Check out the separate diskmags reviews article done by Keefy  for
