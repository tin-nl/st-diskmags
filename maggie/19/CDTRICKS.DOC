CD-ROM  and  Atari?  You  might be forgiven  for  thinking  'White 
Elephant or what' (but not forgiven by me!) as you wonder well  if 
you really wanted a CD-ROM,  why not get a PC to go with it in the 
first place??

Well,  there  is  a bit more to do than surface appearances  would 
first suggest..

Atari Specific compil disks..
There are now several of these,  some of the more interesting ones 
have  been  reviewed  in this issue of Maggie,  and you  can  read 
elsewhere for more specific information on these.. The compilation 
disk is a gathering of assorted Atari software of varying  utility 
and quality, done on the 'lucky dip' principle, although with 600-
odd  megabytes to play with,  it would take a determined effort to 
produce a really disappointing collection.. Another way of summing 
up  a collection of this nature,  is to consider it as a  bulletin 
board in the comfort of your own home.. 

Falcon  specific collections are a bit thin on the ground,  so far 
limited to the excellent 'Transmission' CD, although there are one 
or two more German originated collections bubbling up shortly, and 
the Falcon Owners Group are planning a more up to date  collection 
in  the  new year,  which is the condensed best bits of  their  PD 
library,  plus other Falcon specific goodies, and with an advanced 
control panel promised to play modfiles, animations, show pictures 
etc,  straight  from the disk programmed by the Reservoir Gods  of 
Falcon Maggie fame..

Atari Games on CD..
Regrettably,  in  the  main to be confined to Jaguar,  although  a 
couple  of  Falcon  specific  versions  of  the  Simarils   games, 
Robinsons's  Requiem  and Ishar III have been  produced  for  CD.. 
These  are  a bit on the pricey side,  and should be tried  before 
being bought.. Any other such games on CD are a bit of a long shot 
at the moment.. Most other games tend to be smallish public domain 
efforts,  demo versions of old commercial games,  or beta versions 
of possible Falcon stuff on the compil CDs..

PC Infotainment gubbins..
Yes  you can get some of this for the Falcon now,  the SARA system 
will  run the Grolieres Encyclopaedia on all machines from the  ST 
onwards,  other  titles  can  also be run  from  another  Canadian 
developed proprietary operating system whose name I forget at  the 
moment, but unless you really want to know about the Time Magazine 
'Man of the Year', I'd leave well alone..

Picture disks..
The Corel Paint picture disks for the PC have been recommended for 
one  thing..  These  are themed collections based on  topics  like 
'animals',  or  'great toilets of the British Isles' *joke!*,  and 
consisting of picture files, usually the ubiquitious .GIF or .JPEG 
formats  which can be safely viewed by an Atari of any  complexion 
with  a decent picture viewer..  Other picture collections can  be 
found  in any PC CD ROM suppliers catalogue that offers  a  decent 
variety of such disks..

Anything that relates to the GEM file selector will also relate to 
ExtenDOS and read straight from a CD-ROM..  Just about all art and 
picture   displaying/image  manipulation  utilities  should   read 
straight  off a CD,  from Apex Media to ImageCopy,  taking quite a 
few  others  in,  nothing gave me any problems..  You may prefer a 
'quick' picture browser if you are just window shopping, say Speed 
of  Light  on the ST,  or the Apex Media viewers for  the  Falcon, 
'Showpic' on the Falcon, and various others will also suffice..

ImageCopy 4 supports the Kodak PhotoCD standard in a special  'CD' 
version  where an extra licence fee is paid to Kodak per  copy  of 
the prgram sold by the ST Club..

Other  picture disks are 'themed' in such a way as to be  strictly 
available on a 'top shelf' basis!  The less said about these,  the 
better perhaps!
   
Music..
Audio  CDs  can  be  played from the CD-ROM  using  a  variety  of 
software..  Most need MiNT or MetaDOS to run,  ExtenDOS comes with 
its own, but stand-alone players are starting to appear, which may 
include  a  software  eject  button,  intelligent  track  control, 
and don't need an operating system extension to work..

The  other  sort of music common to us,  is MODfiles,  and a  wide 
selection of these are available on most of the compilation  disks 
as 'filler' material..  Some collections tend to be on the elderly 
(early  Amiga) side,  whereas others (Transmission) are more up to 
date,  and starting to feature multi-channel compositions.. Also a 
rich  source  of 'filler' are the hundreds of  .WAV  sample  files 
which are as wide-ranging as they are strange..

Animation..
An area in whch the Falcon is better gifted than the ST.. The Suzy 
B's Software Treasury features a large number of sixteen colour ST 
Cyber  type  files,  but  other collections tend to put  in  .FLI, 
.MPEG,  and  .AVI  files  which  lean dangerously  to  the  Falcon 
specific  end  of  things..  Not  really  any  specific  animation 
collections sighted, although it may be worth checking out some PC 
CD-ROM  dealers who offer 'multimedia' disks..  The 'Hot Sound and 
Vision' series is well worth a visit,  as these tend to be a mixed 
collection  of  pictures,  animation  files,  modfiles of  various 
exotic  types,  and  even  PC demos..  Better to find a  PC-owning 
friend and crib the disk off them initially to make sure they  are 
any good to you!!
   
At the time of writing, the Falcon is still awaiting a decent .AVI 
player,  the  only  one  currently in existence is very  slow  and 
crude.. People playing .FLI and .MPEG animations are better served 
with  a  wider  range  of good players..  We only  need  a  decent 
sequencing/customisable  playlist  player  now  to  play  lots  of 
animations in a rolling continuous 'multimedia' type fashion , and 
hopefully something should appear before not too long? 

*Update*  -  Apparently,  better  .AVI and Quicktime  (Apple  Mac) 
animation players are now about, and should be with us shortly?

Specific Applications disks..
Best  have  a word with our chums at System Solutions  or  16-32.. 
Several disks of material for the DTP-challenged are in  existence 
bursting with GDOS, Bitstream and Calamus Fonts, clipart, PCX mono 
images, even a freebie typesetting system are all available..

Project  Gutenberg covers a large body of  de-copyrighted  classic 
literature  in generic ASCII text files which can be read  on  ANY 
machine that supports a CD-ROM drive..

Linux  68K on CD,  get all that UNIX and X-Windows gubbins on your 
Falcon..

Cubase CD, even a CD for users of that program now..

I  think that these specialist collections may be even more  of  a 
growth  area  than the general collections in the  future  as  the 
supply of public domain software can only really go so far..

Things which are a pain..
Some  applications refuse to join in the fun..  These include some 
'vital'  ones..  Including  'ST-Zip',  which  refuses to read  the 
directory..  Surprising  really,  as  a  lot  of  collections  are 
archived  as .ZIP format and need to be transported across to  the 
hard  drive..  Kobold is another spoilsport as well..  Back to GEM 
file transfers, ho hum.. 

All in all, something to get your teeth into!
