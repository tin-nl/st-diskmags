Yes I know it's bloody late!! So tell me something I don't know..

CiH  once  again,  in a somewhat late issue 19 of Maggie..  Is  it 
really back in August that I last wrote one of these? Terrible eh, 
I suppose I've got to find something to talk about before  letting 
you go on to the rest of the mag..

Well let's do what we can..

The Party..
This went off almost to plan, as August the 19th came, and with it 
a  number of people,  hell-bent on setting new records of  cramped 
and  inhuman  conditions  in a small flat somewhere  in  the  East 
Midlands..  The  words 'telephone' and 'box' leapt to mind as more 
and  more people crammed in,  taking any space they could find for 
them  and  their bags..  In the end,  it came close to some people 
perching  on the window ledge,  but we made it..  Read more in the 
party report (with embedded realtime text, the THIRD time that the 
realtime text has made it into a disk-based publication, following 
Skynet Times and DBA..  Only with us,  you get some explanation of 
what happened as well, which is quite handy to have really..)

James  Mathews in a masterly ploy of misdirection failed  to  make 
it,  and  was spared the heat and overwhelming crushing sensations 
to his puny body..

New value bumper Maggie..
This  issue (hopefully) should be of a bigger than  average  size, 
which  accounts/excuses for some of the delays..  Part of this  is 
due  to  the design of the Falcon Maggie shell which  has  greater 
'storage  space'  for  larger menu layouts,  which  we  then  feel 
obliged  to  live up to..  Hopefully the size to issue ratio  will 
continue in this bigger vein in the future..

Fried Bits 4..
Is now known as Symposium '96, and is a combined event with PC and 
Amiga, now based in Hamburg.. This year, I'll be there!! I will!!

Personal Stuff..
I've  moved  residence,  the new address is in the  address  file, 
although any mail sent to No.84 will be redirected here,  over the 
next few months at least..

Why I've moved?  Simply a little 'disagreement' with the party who 
were my previous employers, who happen to be unprincipled scumbags 
who  wanted  the property back!!  Wait and see if they'll let  the 
situation lie now,  or if any acts of nastiness on my part will be 
needed in the future!!

(For  those  people who came to the Maggie party,  I've not  moved 
that fair, just half a mile or so up the road..)

The Falcon is happier, it has been treated to a new CD-ROM, bigger 
hard  drive,  and  maths  co-processor  since the  last  issue  of 
Maggie..  Oh,  and  the  internal  speaker  has been  removed  and 
ceremonially destroyed as well..

Mother has now got a PC at home, which slightly sucks, but I don't 
suppose  that she was ever going to get Microsoft 'Office'  on  an 
ST..  It does come with a very nice colour inkjet printer though.. 
She  managed  to get it at a sensible price from  some  very  good 
friends  who  have  been featured here before,  and go  under  the 
initials 'M' and 'D'!!

My knowledge of DOS and Windows has come on by 500%, and I am even 
more  grateful  for  what  I've  got  that  is  of  a  non-Windows 
complexion..  The  two Bill Gates originated operating systems are 
strangely fun,  in a fiddly,  computer geeky sort of way, but some 
simple things on an ST or Falcon,  always have to be done the long 
way on a PC..  Adding new files for instance.. As I said just now, 
DOS  and  Windows are fine for an experienced user,  but not  that 
good for a first timer.. it is interesting that HUGE supplementary 
books  and guides,  authored by third party experts are needed  to 
try to explain in a simple manner to these people??

Something upside down here I think..

I've  also  had my first (tedious) experience of Windows  '95,  it 
took  the  best part of an hour to install,  and managed to  crash 
twice within half an hour of running it.. The person concerned had 
installed  it specifically to run a PC version of  Calamus..  This 
did not perform much faster than the ST version in most functions, 
which  was odd as it was running on a DX4/100 MHZ..  A machine  12 
times  faster than a basic ST??  (But raw power and processor  MHZ 
isn't everything *snigger!*)

Somebody writing in the January issue of ST Format (letters  page) 
considered  the ST as 'Not much better than a dog'  in  comparison 
with a modern PC..  A valid point perhaps,  but at least the ST is 
properly house-trained!! A Windows '95 PC may need more than a few 
smacks on the nose with a rolled up newspaper to put it right..

Things to look forward to for 1996..
There's  some  new  Jag  stuff,   especially  Defender  2000,  and 
Battlesphere, and Zero-5, all new Reservoir Gods productions, with 
at least one major game for the ST and several nice little goodies 
for  the Falcon from them..  Apex Media version 3,  the Aggression 
party  demos,  the  Fried  Bits 4/Symposium party,  the new  F.O.G 
diskmag shell and the F.O.G CD-ROM, all new Top-Byte stuff, Falcon 
Obsession  back again..  Also the Falcon version of 'Team' has not 
gone away, a proper Falcon version of 'Doom' at last??

Also  several more issues of famous diskmags,  the last couple  of 
ST-News,  several  more  issues of the paper mags if you are  into 
that sort of thing..  Huge wads of upgrades for the Falcon,  a new 
affordable  graphics  card  for  the  ST  that  gives  it  PC-type 
resolutions and truecolour palette for about three hundred  notes, 
which  was  the  sort of price that you used to  pay  for  a  bog-
standard ST back in the golden age of 1990 or thereabouts..

Oh yes, and I finally get to win the lottery to pay for them all!!

That's enough inconsequential flavouring around the edges, time to 
get on with some serious hardcore reading!!

 CiH - Jan '96..
