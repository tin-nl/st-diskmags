                FADING TECHNIQUES ON THE ATARI FALCON

One of the oldest  presentation  effects  is  the  fade. One graphical
screen fades out, the next  one  fades  in.  This effect has been used
extensively on all computers, but hasn't been seen on the Falcons true
colour mode as up until recently it was thought impossible.

For the non coders I will try to  give an explanation of fading. In 16
and 256 colour mode you have  a  number  of paletter registers and you
just need to change that palette register and the all pixels on screen
assigned to that register will change.  So  to change all colours on a
16 colour screen you need just to change 16 registers, on a 256 colour
screen 256 registers must be changed.

On a true colour screen things  are  different.  There is no palette -
each pixel is completely  independent  from  every  other pixel on the
screen. To fade a screen down  you  have to change EVERY single pixel.
This means reading in every pixel, isolating the RGB values and fading
them then combing them to  make  a  new  colour  and writing the pixel
back. On a low res screen of  320x240 this means 76,800 pixels have to
be calculated and unfortunatel there is no where near enough processor
time to do this in one VBL.

Consequently you don't see fades so  often on the Falcon. Screens will
hardware scroll off  (a  technique  I  used  on  the  intro screens of
Tautology 2) or be cleared a couple of pixels at a time.

But there has  been  a  breakthrough  and  true  colour  fading is now
possible on the Falcon! This comes  through  a  lot of clever fiddling
with the hardware, and some slight reprogramming of the VIDEL.

This effect was discovered by Aggression,  and  told  to me by Evil of
Dead Hackers Society. It is an effect  I had noticed but not realised.
The early versions of God-paint, although running in true colour mode,
had a white border, that is colour  0 of the falcon palette was white.
I noticed that graphics on  my  monitor  looked  a  lot darker than on
Ripley's SVGA monitor. I changed  the  background  colour to black and
graphics appeared lighter. I  assumed  this  was  just something to do
with the glare of the  white  light  making  the other graphics appear
dimmer, but it is more subtle than that.

There is a hidden feature  of  the  VIDEL  whereby you can control the
intensity of a  true  colour  screen  by  altering  the  value  of the
background colour register.  You  must  clear  the  videl's horizontal
border end register at the start  of  every  VBL, then poke the falcon
palette register 0. For a full intensity screen the value of $ffff9800
must be 0. For a dark screen the value of $ffff9800 must be $FFFF00FF.
To fade you simply interpolate between these two values.

A quick example of the code:

        moveq   #0,d7                   ;full intensity

fade    move.w  #$25,-(a7)              ;wait vbl
        trap    #14
        addq.w  #2,a7

        clr.w   $ffff8286.w             ;clear hbe

        moveq   #0,d0
        bfins   d7,d0{0:6}              ;set red
        bfins   d7,d0{8:6}              ;set green
        bfins   d7,d0{24:6}             ;set blue
        move.l  d0,$ffff9800.w          ;set palette register

        addq.w  #1,d7                   ;dec intensity
        cmp.w   #64,d7                  ;lowest intensity reached?
        blt.s   fade                    ;no, loop



There are some disadvantages with this effect.

The first is that you can't fade  to  black, the lowest intensity is a
dark grey. You can get past this problem by quickly screen swapping to
a black screen when you reach dark grey.

Also the border colour increases  as  the  main picture decreases, and
this looks a bit messy.

Also this effect doesn't work  on  VGA monitors, though apparently DHS
have come up with a hack  to  get  this  working. If you manage to get
this working on other monitors, let us know!
