                  BY VARIOUS ASSORTED FRENCH PERSONS


More  French  wizz  coding   with   an  alleged  horticultural  theme.
Unfortunately the only plant you do see is in the opening screen, from
there fans of Gardener's Question  Time  will  find it is downhill all
the way. Fans of foot to the metal chip burning demo effects will find
quite the opposite.

The Geranium demo is not quite  finished,  and lacks the polish of its
contemporaries. I had what I believed  to  be a preview version months
ago, and it turns out that it is the same as the full release version.
Whilst there may be something  missing  in  the credits screens, it is
more than made up by the rest of the demo.

The demo begins with another superlative picture by Flan of Exa who is
become one of the most prolific (and  one of the best) graphics men on
the Falcon. This logo is again expertly done with a bloke who has been
given a nasty shock by a nearby plant.

The first effect then begins, a texture  fills the screen and as it is
the same as one used  on  "Evolution"  my  initial assumption was that
this was going to be another rotating  zoomer. But no, it is a rotater
with distorting a weird lighting!  Original  enough  to stand head and
shoulders above the pile of similar effects doing the rounds.

Straight into the next  effect,  this  is  quite  hard to explain. The
nearest approximation I can make is  a  very chunky 3D spline which is
rotating  round  the  screen.   It   builds   up  nicely  then  slowly
disintegrates as the  screen  nears  the  end.  Another  good original
effect.

The obligatory plasma effect hardware scrolls on. This has a star type
structure at the centre and the  colours  oscillate nicely. One of the
best examples of the plasma genre.
(LAYMANS NOTE: For  those  of  you  unsure  of  the  precise technical
definition of what a  plasma  effect  is,  it  means  "bung  a load of
colours on the screen and wibble them about a bit")

The next effect is one of my  favourite in the demo. A fantasy picture
of a wizened elven type  creature  is  displayed  in the background. A
series of 3D objects are  rotated  over  the picture. These are "glass
polygons" you can see the picture behind, but it is slightly displaced
as if you were looking through  water.  The  effect is very similar to
texture  mapping,  but  without   the  perspective  transformation  or
rotations  -  more  just  displacement  mapping,  but  it  looks  very
effective - and is another original effect.

After the glass vectors, the next effect  is  a bit of a let down. You
are flying through a 3D grid of line vectors. Unfortunately the effect
in EKO-System was  a  good  deal  better  featuring  solid vectors and
better clipping.

We move swiftly onto the next effect.  A face appears in the middle of
screen and it illuminated by a  new  type  of lighting model (at least
for the Falcon). Phong shading  sweeps  over the face's surface giving
it an eerie glow. A quick but very nice effect.

The next section involves texture mapping and  is  a bit of a let down
by the high standards the  early  part  of  the  demo had set. A rough
looking bloke appears in the  middle  of  the  screen. This graphic is
them mapped onto a Torus.  Unfortunately  this  is not really an ideal
piece of graphics to use as there is  a  lot of black on the image and
the background is black so a  lot  of the texture mapped torus appears
undistinguished from the  background.  Not  too  much imagination went
into the presentation of this effect.

After the torus disappears, the head  is stretched about and distorted
in an amusing way. He appears  to  be  in  a hall of mirrors, and they
aren't very flattering.

The  penultimate  effect  is  something   new.  Don't  you  just  hate
describing demo effects? I'll give this a go...
There are two blobs (hmmm not going well so far) like two big pools of
energy that appear  to  be  constantly  attracted  to  each other then
repulsed from each other and merge  together  then split apart. It has
similarities to that mercury  bit  in  Inter's  "Terrorise Your Soul".
Again this is a good effect.

The end credits also features a shock - it is not a vertical scrolling
message! Plus there are no credits  or greetings (although the message
"Sorry! No time enough for  design"  is  scribbled along the bottom of
the screen). At the top of the screen  in a little box is an exquisite
rippling water effect.

This has to be one of  the  best  demos  of  1995. It may not have the
immediately outstanding 3D effects of EKO or  EXA, or the in your face
style of Lazer, but in its own way  it  brings a lot of new effects to
the Falcon, and presents some old  effects  in a new way. In gardening
terms it is the Percy Thrower of  demos  (if you are reading in a non-
Blue Peter literate country, that  is a complement). Usually Geraniums
are foul smelling little plants,  but  this  demo comes up smelling of
roses.
