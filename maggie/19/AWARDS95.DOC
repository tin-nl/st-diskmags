Only  November,  but  just thought we would get  our  scandalously 
entertaining views written of what made 1995, well, 1995!

(Puts on rotund self-satisfied Australian TV commentator mask)

Right,  most  of  the  categories seen previously  in  last  years 
'Awards' (Dirk column, issue 16) are back.. One or two changes are 
also  made,  as  some categories very big last year,  just did not 
need  to  be  gone into this time around..  For  example,  certain 
sections  of  the press were very well behaved this  time  around, 
compared with last year..

Without further ado;


Most Significant event of the year..
From  a purely personal view,  it has to be the release of  Maggie 
18,  the  fifth  birthday issue,  and also in its brand new Falcon 
enhanced  clothing..  The other more general 'happening' worthy of 
the  title of 'most significant' was the creation of a  new  print 
mag, Atari World, from the sad scraps of ST Review..


Best Game of 1995..
A fairly hot area still,  with more and more Falcon specific stuff 
coming through..  Unique Developments Substation, a gouraud shaded 
tunnel  romp for STE and Falcon seems to be the winner by a  short 
head,  but with several others,  including 'Double Bobble' for the 
Falcon, 'Stardust', 'Towers II', 'Moonspeeder', and more breathing 
hotly on its neck..


Best Fiver Spent for 1995..
Nothing  quite in that category this year,  but a really decent œ3 
would get you Tautology II,  and a wisely invested tenner will get 
you  100 extra levels for the Reservoir Gods platform  spectacular 
Double Bobble.. (Good eh, this notso subliminal advertising!)


Shareware Scare Story of the year..
Nothing yet to rival the panic caused by the registrations drought 
for StarBall last year,  but is it really much better now,  or are 
people just keeping their dismay to themselves??


Trend to most carefully watch..
Is  our print media all that stable and long-lasting?  There is  a 
distinct lack of subscription forms in recent issues of ST  Format 
which kind of suggests that there are not too many more of them to 
go.  When asked about this,  they said that the subscription pages 
had been dropped as the overall page count for ST Format had  gone 
down  and  they did not wish to waste space (66 pages  as  of  Jan 
'96!)  However,  this sounds as plausible as dropping the contents 
pages or front cover to save space..  We think time is running out 
for ST Format so get 'em whilst you can! At least Atari World seem 
to be around for the time being..

No subscription forms = No intention to carry on!


Best Utility, serious doobrie of 1995..
Anybody  got any suggestions of their own??  Felice thinks Expose, 
the video digitiser hardware to go with Apex is pretty neat,  Leon 
favours  BSS  Debug for those tense assembly language  moments.  I 
can't  really  come up with much apart from Graoumf  Tracker,  the 
first proper Screamtracker capable multichannel tracker.. A bit of 
a dead heat here..


Best Vapourware/Rumour of 1995..
The  only  clear  contender  for this  is  of  course,  the  Atari 
MicroBox,  a  machine which is an amalgam of everybody's  dreams.. 
Has been officially denied,  but... (At least one respected figure 
in  the Atari community,  presumably with inside access reckons  a 
prototype with a prototype 68060 CPU DOES actually exist!!)


Best Music Utility of 1995..
Probably  the most expensive nomination for the average  Atarian.. 
The C-Lab Falcon Mark II.. Entirely recommended for mid-range MIDI 
users,  so says Paul Wiffen of Digital Village,  and he knows what 
he is talking about, so he must be correct..


Demo of the year..
A clear winner, hurrah!

It only can be the EKO System Demo,  the second prize winner of he 
Fried  Bits III event,  bringing a new standard of presentation to 
the  Falcon..  Laser  came  a  very  close  second  by  redefining 
'multimedia' in no less than seven megs of hard disk space.. Other 
worthies  incluide  several  of the 96k  Intro  category,  Digital 
Chaos, Avena, and more..


Biggest Non-event of the year..
Was 1995 the final decline and death of the ST demo.. I hardly saw 
a  thing  for that machine this year from one end of the  year  to 
another!! 


Biggest non-event - Lifetime achievement award..
Well  there can only be one serious contender for this..  Come  on 
down,  the  Atari sales and marketing department..  After making a 
start  with the ST,  they rapidly blew it with a dizzying array of 
new  models,  the  STacey,  TT,  Mega  STE,  ST Book and Falcon all 
condemmed  to obscurity,  and with the Jaguar soon to join  them.. 
Atari  have  had  the  knack of taking  a  good  hardware  design, 
underselling  it,  and then losing interest before it has a chance 
to  get going..  Lately Atari have decided that the future lies in 
becoming  a  software publisher..  What next if that fails?? 


Yellow Press Sulphuric Acid resistant Swimming trunks award..
A  bit of a nosedive in nominations here too,  the print media was 
better  behaved  this year,  even the Edge,  with a slightly  less 
sneering  approach,  or  perhaps  everyone just got  used  to  the 
inbuilt bias and substitution of the editor's personal agenda  for 
objective analysis??


Best Diskmag of 1995..
Come on, do you think we would really be so immodest!

One of the nicest things to come out of this year on the  diskzine 
front  was the rebirth of Diskbusters Mag into its own  very  nice 
new Falcon shell, which differed from ours in certain ways, but is 
still very nice..

I  also  enjoyed  the  appearance  of  the  first  really   decent 
Specialist Fanzine on the ST, the StarTrek fixated Warp magazine..

Joint honours for these two then..


Hero of the year..
This one is an excuse to indulge in a little personal praisegiving 
and licence to pat backs..

Leon O'Reilly (Mr Pink of Reservoir Gods) for his years coding  to 
produce  Tautology II and the Bubble Bobble 'replica' game  Double 
Bobble,  both  for the Falcon,  and especially his epic labours on 
the new Falcon specific Maggie shell, culminating in his finishing 
issue 18 ON TIME (just!) on the 19th August 1995.. Ably abetted by 
fellow  Reservoir  Gods members Kev and Tash,  you may  all  start 
blushing now!!


Villain of the Year..
No  really  memorable characters here yet,  more a case of  people 
behaving in an unsurprising and predictable manner,  eg. Psygnosis 
selling  out to Sony,  Windows '95 turning out to be a pain in the 
bottom area,  Atari (non) marketing dept in action/inertia again.. 
But  nothing  shocking  or unexpected,  a  bit  like  incontinence 
following on from senility,  sad, depressing, inevitable, and more 
than a tad dull really..


Subliminal Advertising award 1995 (Ultimate Virus Killer..)
Sorry Tronic, it just has to be mentioned, a scary 3% for the Boot 
Sector  Installer in issue 76 of ST Format,  in a review  peppered 
with  references and recommendations for UVK..  Are you being paid 
by Richard Karsmakers by the hour or what??

  
Competitor  Misfortune,   most  hilarious,  or  should  that  read 
grossly delayed resurrection??
Nothing  special  to report here..  Against PlayStation,  Sega are 
being  portrayed  as fumblers and bunglers,  with  their  parallel 
launch of the Saturn..  Very humbling for them, no doubt, but they 
had  been  due  a  good  kicking  for  a  while..  Everyone  else, 
especially  Atari are keeping a lowish profile this year,  but the 
resurrection  of the year has to be the re-arrival of the Amiga  a 
year too late,  and a hundred pounds too dear..  Watch this one to 
see what happens readers!

 
Wires Crossed media cock-up of 1995!
Atari  World were impatient to get a nomination here..  They  were 
only  able  to  contain themselves until issue  three,  when  they 
unleashed the now famous 'Barbie Doll' cover onto an  unsuspecting 
world..  This  heralded  the 'safe sex' issue,  which went down so 
well,  that  a  couple  of  pages got 'lost'  after  it  left  the 
printers..  Unfortunately,  Vic Lennard did not realise that 'safe 
sex' in a publication like this one really meant 'no sex'.. A long 
queue  of  the outraged of Surrey formed outside  the  offices  of 
Atari  World  armed with red hot pokers,  tweezers,  and rolled up 
newspapers, ready to argue the point to some sort of conclusion??


Better never than late..
Another cheap shot at Windows '95, but what the hell!!


Best Computer Show of 1995..
A  bit  of  a slump in quality events (at time  of  writing),  the 
Spring  Spotlight  Show was shared with feral  semi  house-trained 
Amiga owners who left their distinctive odour on everything.. ECTS 
was okay, but a bit of a drag.. The best show. perhaps, was one on 
foreign  shores,  the  participants of the Fried Bits III seem  to 
have  had  a  really good time,  but I'm only taking  this  second 
hand (sigh).. Definitely one to try next year!!


The Hype falters..
But  it  doesn't,  it  won't!  Will  they just SHUT UP  about  the 
PlayStation,  and that pile of boring old toss, Windows '95 before 
I throw something out of the window, WITHOUT OPENING IT FIRST!!!


Summing it all, up, the word that best describes 1995..
For  a  second  year  running,  "Bollocks",  a word  to  fit  many 
occasions.. Still with years left in it!!
