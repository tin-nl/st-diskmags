      (With new added Realtime article for extra freshness!!)

The  definitive  report on the 'happenings',  non-happenings,  and 
especially certain non-arrivals (hi James!)

Is it really now three weeks after the event? It is only now, that 
the last of the Jammie Dodgers are being eaten,  (YES NOW!) (kinda 
unusual  approach  to  breakfast on a Sunday  morning?)  and  this 
report is being written at last..

These  are  the views and observations of the main  man  involved, 
CiH..  There  are other accounts of these desperate times,  one or 
two of these may even be seen in this issue of Maggie as well, and 
indeed,  this  report  is  'embedded' with the full  text  of  the 
realtime  article to add to your reading pleasure,  but to be able 
to consider the whole thing from start to finish, then start right 
here..

No, not there -  Here!!
(Cah, just can't get quality readers these days!)

New Shell..
We  go  back some time before the start of  this,  several  issues 
ago..  I've always wanted a specific Falcon enhanced Maggie shell, 
almost  since the issue 12 fixes to get the Delta Force  model  to 
run on the '030.. Initial ideas went to an upgrade to the existing 
code,  say  a  nice  256 colour min menu piccy,  and four  channel 
MODfile music instead of Big Alec, or total silence in the case of 
the Falcon..  According to Felice,  someone did have a go at doing 
this,  but  due to pressure on their time,  was unable to get very 
far..  Another  possible  avenue was peeked into,  with the  shell 
program  that RiCH Davey was developing for his  magazine,  Falcon 
Update  Digital,  but  this  was not really quite what we  had  in 
mind..  

The next logical step, had to be to approach someone reliable that 
we  knew,  who  could do a good job if we asked them..  Enter Leon 
O'Reilly and his hatful of pseudonyms..

I  approached  him towards the end of last year with the  idea  of 
doing a Falcon specific Maggie, and he said, yes, he would like to 
do that..  Some thoughts of mine were clarified into written form, 
and  things started in earnest..  Leon had some ideas of his  own, 
and  a free hand to carry them out with..  The new Maggie would be 
started entirely from scratch, although with certain good features 
of  the Delta Force shell hopefully kept in,  which was really the 
way it should have been from the start..

Anniversaries..
Maggie reached its third birthday very shortly after the 'rebirth' 
issue 11 was released..  We were not really conscious of that fact 
though,  just being pleased to make it back into circulation.. The 
first  outburst  of  temporal  awareness  came  with  the   fourth 
anniversary  issue,  in a slightly surprised,  "So here we are yet 
again?" type of editorial..  Around this time, we decided it would 
be really neat to have some sort of celebration of the fifth year, 
which was going to originally be issue 17.. 

At  the  end of last year,  some firmer decisions were  made,  the 
fifth anniversary issue would now be issue 18, which had an August 
release  date  pencilled  in for it..  Realising that  the  actual 
anniversary  date was in very early June,  but also realising that 
this  date  fell inbetween the normal release dates,  which  would 
have  left  us  with either a very late 'spring'  issue  (with  no 
Falcon shell!), or a very rushed and poor quality effort to try to 
make  the June 'deadline'..  We got around the problem by deciding 
on  a totally new date a long time in advance,  which was just  as 
well really..

A preliminary invitation thing was issued to a number of  selected 
people, some of them even eventually turned up..

The shell was making good progress,  the original modest 'upgrade' 
turning  into a new and exciting creation,  and in good time,  the 
first  preview,  of  the  text  displayer  was  shown..  This  was 
essentially  what  there  is  today,  but with  the  nice  rastery 
background  removed  in the final version as rasters  and  Falcons 
don't go together very well at all.. 

Time skims on,  summer approaches, final invitations are sent out, 
a further preview is seen,  and shown to a select few,  this time, 
the  first inklings of the main menu system are seen as well..  It 
all  looks  so  good..  The  usual jobs of gathering  in  all  the 
textfiles  from promised contributors,  and writing what is due to 
done  by yourself are done..  The replies to the invitations start 
to trickle in, a mixed bag, with several 'no's for various reasons 
mixed  in with the positive ones..  The one thing that this  event 
could have done with, were a few more people, but not too many, as 
events turned out, could we have coped, frankly, I doubt it..
  
By  the time of the final ten days in August,  the phone lines are 
burning up daily over last minute changes and hassles,  it is like 
trying  to  nail  a  jelly to the floor,  but  a  plan  is  pieced 
together.. 

The very last few days are spent in finishing touches to the  mag, 
the  very  last  articles,  are  done,  and the first  attempt  at 
compiling  the  regular  (IE Delta Force) version  of  Maggie  are 
done..  This  saves us a heck of a lot of time later on..  The one 
slight  problem is that an ASCII graphic of a birthday cake  drawn 
by Mike Noyce,  and intended for the bottom 'blank' menu bar, does 
not translate very well at all to the Maggie character set.. After 
some  fiddling  aropund,  this  is  ditched,  and some  cheap  and 
cheerful ASCII large text is put there instead..  

Thursday,  the  flat  is cleaned by me,  in a mad  spring-cleaning 
frenzy..  I'm  sure  no-one wants to sleep on a floor  with  three 
months of debris on it!! I also go shopping, and load a trolley up 
with  gallons  of coke,  and lots of junk food..  Pausing only  to 
complain about declining educational standards to the woman in the 
queue  next  to  me  (or  whatever  else  people  talk  about   in 
supermarket  queues),  I  get  home..  A large amount of junk  and 
furniture  re-arranging  follows to make the best  of  the  rather 
small  amount of space there is..  In the suddenly rather spacious 
(for one person) lounge, I settle down to write the editorial, the 
very last text,  apart from the READ.ME file to be done on the day 
itself..

All ready now, just have to await the hordes tomorrow..

Friday 18th August..
The  day it all begins,  well another thing you may like to  know, 
was that I was busy at work on some kind of training course  where 
you  had to banter,  role-play and have yourself videoed 'doing  a 
General  Patton'  to  various  kinds  of  receptive,   or  hostile 
audiences,  good  training  for facing the next forty eight  hours 
maybe??

Five thirty-ish, I get home, the first arrival is Leon, due at the 
not  unreasonable hour of 6.30pm,  time to sit down,  get changed, 
let  the dust of the day settle down a bit you may think..  Not  a 
chance,  the  phone is ringing even as I struggle the key into the 
front door lock..  It is Leon,  who having encountered a fortunate 
conjunction  of trains in the Birmingham New Street star  cluster, 
was  able to make it to sunny Northampton a whole  hour  earlier.. 
Yippee, time to go..

Another problem was the fact that the usually tedious Rushden rush 
hour  traffic  was  moving even slower than  usual,  with  several 
police  cars blocking off key areas..  (This turned out to be  the 
aftermath of the fatal accident referred to by Felice in the real-
time text a bit later on..) 

Nevertheless, with the sun low in the western sky, I drive towards 
Northampton  at  demon-possessed speed,  arriving at  the  railway 
station,  somewhere  in the region of the half-hour I had promised 
Leon  on  the  phone..  I park,  and find Leon,  another  pleasant 
surprise is the presence of his sister Natasha (Ripley of the Res. 
Gods)..  Leon is wearing a hilarious baseball cap,  which is a bit 
too  big for him,  and has the effect of trimming a half-decade or 
more  off his real age..  He apparently managed to get a half-fare 
for  the  train  with the aid of this dubious  hat!!  He  did  not 
succeed  in removing this humourous headgear until very  late  the 
next day!?!

We get back home, having now got a whole hour to myself before the 
next  pick-up,  which  is RiCH Davey and VoGue (Rich and John)  at 
8.15pm..  I  introduce  Leon  to the fridge,  and my  Falcon  very 
quickly  and in roughly that order,  and he sets to work  straight 
away  on  the  '030  edition of Maggie  18..  This  is  his  first 
encounter with TOS 4.01 (A close encounter of the wonky kind!) and 
immediately,  lots  of things need doing to get it to run properly 
on  the subtly different environment that is my Falcon..  However, 
he does start getting results quickly, so I am at last able to see 
the new shell and text displayer in all its fully working  glory.. 
Overcome with this,  I rush off to ring up a bemused Slimer of DBA 
mag  over  in Holland,  who wonders if I am on drugs owing to  the 
delerious style of conversation I am using.. "Not Yet!" I reply..

The  next pick up looms closer,  for this one,  I am expecting the 
arrival of Richard (Felice) around 7.30pm,  and he does,  so it is 
off  back  to  town in his car,  which seems to take him  aback  a 
little,  in  spite of the fact this had been discussed  previously 
with him..  Some more dual carriageway type traversing later,  and 
we  pull up outside the looming 'Fuhrerbunker' style mass  of  the 
Greyfriars  Bus Station in Northampton..  We have but a few  scant 
minutes  to  wait,  as a more or less on time coach  from  Bristol 
arrives..  Straining  to catch sight of RiCH and John as they pile 
off  the  bus..  We all file back to Felice's car for the  journey 
home..

One little detour to the house of a friend who is kindly  donating 
the  use  of his STe,  Atari colour monitor,  and his 15 inch SVGA 
monitor..  These  are  loaded in the boot by our troops  who  take 
things  fairly  carefully an account of (A) they have just  had  a 
long  tiring coach journey,  and (B) Nathan,  whose gear it indeed 
is,  is  quite  useful with a length of bamboo stick,  in a  Bruce 
Lee/Jackie Chan sort of way!

We get back, we unload both people and computer gear into a lounge 
area that is rapidly filling up..  As well as all the other stuff, 
everyone else thus far has brought with them,  their fair share of 
bags,  sleeping  bags,  and  odds and sods have come too,  so it is 
starting  to  get problematic where to put your feet  if  you  are 
trying to get across the room.. Also kindly donated to the weekend 
is RiCH's laptop PC (Commodore 286 model!) This is to be the  home 
and  sanctuary of the realtime article,  with VoGue effectively in 
charge of this.. 

It is goodbye from me again,  as I set off yet again, this time in 
my  own car,  to pick up the final two arrivals for this  evening, 
namely Kev and Tat..

The  journey  down is remarkably similar to all  the  others  I've 
done,  apart from the fact that it is now dark, and the Pink Floyd 
tape in the old car stereo ('Animals') is somewhat nearer the  end 
than  before  ..  Kev  and Tat are due to  arrive  at  Northampton 
Railway station at 9.30pm.. I am told to look out for an Endsleigh 
football  shirt  getting off the train  (presumably  with  someone 
inside  of  it,  a disembodied footy shirt on its own would  be  a 
'tat' alarming methinks!?!?)

The  'choo-choo'  arrives from 'Oop-T'North' and two  very  scarey 
people  approach..  Kev ('SH3' of The Res..  Gods) has bought some 
dodgy hair from a street trader,  especially for the occasion.. It 
is  sadistically yellow,  sort of nuclear weapons flash in texture 
with approximately the same sort of long term damage to your  eyes 
afterwards.. Tat looks almost human.. Pausing briefly to point out 
a  very  sad plaque which commemorated Northampton  Station  being 
made  into  a  cattle-shed construction sometime in  1987,  we  go 
home..

With the addition of two more people, and their gear and bags, the 
space  situation  can be described as 'cosy',  extremely cosy,  in 
fact..  With people tending to dump their stuff any old how, it is 
a  tight spot we are all in,  and not a clue between us how to get 
out of it..

About  this  time,  some  fumbling around for a  spare  powerpoint 
managed  to see the Laptop burst into life,  and the start of  the 
realtime article, at about this point.. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which is where we now roam to, for the time being..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the start of the real-time article... where's the chip shop?

August 18, 1995

TO BEGIN WITH

Well, the first person to raid the keyz is me, Vogue of Skynet. The
time is 10.16pm, and we've just arrived at CIH's flat in Northants.
The coach that me a RiCH took was slow and the 4 hour journey was
most bollox. Also here is: Kev, Tat, Rich Felice, Leon, Ripley, Moi,
and also the man himself, Chris H.

Tonight will be the biggest squash ever as there will be about ten of
us in Chris' titchy flat. Oh well, I doubt we'll be getting much
sleep anyway!! In the morning we'll be moving to the hotel room here
in Rushden for the main 'bulk' of the party.

We've been looking at the new '030 Maggie shell as it stands at the
moment. Kev is now answering the questions to enter the hidden
article. Ripley, who wrote the questions, is here so we're not having
to much difficulty.

PROLOGUE (THE FIRST OF MANY)

Over the next 36 hours, the world will be thrusted into new
dimensions of computer technology as the new Maggie shell is
released. Also excessive amounts of Coke will be drunk. I've bought 6
cans of Gateway cola - major piss up here we go type style thing.

Bollox to that, I'll let someone else on the keyz.............
Eeerrrrrmmmm.........

Well, I've just been offered this dinky keyboard by John .. sorry,
it's Felice here .... up to my old tricks again!!!

Why the fuck do women drivers insist on driving at speeds of less
than 30 mph on the roads around here?  I had to do some pretty nifty
overtaking to get past a fair few of them earlier on tonight.  As
soon as I got here it was 'Hello and Goodbye Leon & Ripley' - for CIH
dragged me out - back to my car again - and told me in no uncertain
terms to drive to Northampton.  Still, unlike the system that is ued
in Cambridge with the infamous tow-away scheme (yes, more infamous
than Sobibor!!!!) (well, maybe not.)

So, here I am, with all the guys (correction, there is a girl here
too by the name of Ripley .... ) No, not the one from Alien (did
anyone see that on TV recently?), sadly not Sigourney Weaver, nor
Meredith Salenger, but what the hell, she's sexy anyway......

Just thought ... one of our famous article writers who appeared in
issue 18 after a long break is celebrating his 30th wedding
anniversary this weekend.  Congratulations Del and Thelma, hope you
like the present (I wasn't sure if you had a CD player or not, but
there you go!)  Hope you have a good day & evening and .... what
exactly DID the family organise for you in the end???  

They're all playing a game called Asteroidia at the moment, but
someone seems to be unsure as to which joystick port to use (ie a Jag
pad or a standard one)

Asteroidia reminds me of Megaroids .. but it is much better than
that, I'll grant you .. Oops CIH's Falcon has just reset itself...

Hey, it's on again now .....

We've got an advertisers (ie preview) issue of Atari World Issue 5 -
it looks good as usual .. with a review of ST News issue 10.1!  No,
that isn't a mistype, no it wasn't really Issue 1.2 written back in
1985 (was it??? I forget) this was the dogs bollocks, actually issue
10.1!  It got a good score as well and was presented as a
utility...which is a surprise to me personally but there you go!

My greets, I think, now .. no doubt these will be greeted again by
whoever else uses this portable (someone keeps farting .. maybe
someone (not me) had an Indian meal last night.  That's one of the
reasons why I keep off Indian food, as CIH well knows, I go in for
the running of International Loudest Farting Competition! - without
needing to have an Indian in the first place.

Where was I ... ok, the greets.....

CIH ... for the use of his little flat (there again it isn't that big
but we're (well I am at least) all comfy)

Leon ... an excellent Falcon-only Maggie shell for issue 18!!! When
can we have the source-code for it??

Kev ... I have enjoyed seeing your pics on the recent issues of
Maggie .. long may they continue!

Harald of Lazer ... thanx for the emails .. hope your holiday went
well.  The Lost Blubb demo was superb .. and it HAS been shown on
American TV on their show 'The World of Demos' ... this is also shown
in Canada, where my cousin saw it.

Joanna Pacula .. I presume you are still reading Maggie, as I have
noticed that whatever I write over the years seems to get noticed.
I enjoyed your recent movie 'Last Gasp' - welcome back to the world
of good movies!!!!  Even though your other recent stuff has been OK
as far as you are concerned .. still it is nice to have another
classic out here.  More of that would be more than welcome!
I'll be setting up a Web page devoted entirely to you soon, so keep a
lookout for it!

Meredith Salenger ... what a pleasure to see your movie 'April
Morning' last night .. supplied to me by a very good friend from
Germany who runs the Tommy Lee Jones Newsletter .. and you'll be
seeing this soon in a forthcoming issue of Maggie.  I look forward to
seeing Village of the Damned in October .. from what I hear it is
good.

Rutger Hauer ... what are these rumours floating around that you
enjoy dressing as a woman?? I hope that is not what I think it means
... ie you are doing this for research into your next movie???

It looks like Devpac is on-screen at the moment .. and Leon is coding
away merrily on high.......

Now Maggie 18 is working again .. well, it wasn't NOT working before
.. but I think Leon was trying to grab some screens from Asteroidia.
Now the screen has been dimmed .. what's going on now?

Bye Bye Feline Felice!! Vogue back now, bringing you 'chit-chat' from
the hip-hopping pooh-plopping cow-tipping Maggie fifth birthday
party.

While I have the keyz, I must put in a plug for 'Far Out Dadio'
T-shirts, that are available at Greenbelt, Pheonix, Glastonbury and
Soul Survivor festivals. Don't delay, buy one today!!

No-one really wants to type at the moment, so I'll just save this and
bogart off for a while.......................

CiH logon..AT LAST I arrive, it is 11.33pm Greenwich extremely tight
time, and I finally get to have a go at this realtime article verbal
abuse thing.. 

At the moment I am in a room with seven other people who have a black
belt and masters degree in making the worst possible use of the very
limited available room.. These are Leon, Kev, Leon's sister Natasha,
Tat of Digital Chaos, or who may BE Digital Chaos, if the rumours are
correct.. Also John (Skynet), Rich (FOG) Davey, and Felice, (Rich S.)

I must check if someone has not done this before??

The rest of the evening seems to be spent impersonating a
taxi-driver, as I made three separate trips to Northampton to collect
most of these people.. (Whaddya mean, mate, I had to use my car for
at least one of these!....Felice)  (BUT we did agree to share  the 
driving beforehand, remember?!! - CiH)

Bags, bags, bags, we must sort something out if we are to carry on
breathing, probably everyone will end up taking home everyone else's
personal possessions.. OK if I swop Kev's Falcon and Jag for a tube
of toothpaste!!!

 Just caught first sight of the new Digital Chaos routines, and they
are WIKKID!

Kev has had some chips, but did not like them, "You can't win with
chips" he say..

"Chips always have the last word.." I wisely say..

"But what is that last word?" Queried Leon, totally killing the
conversation stone dead..

"Everything works with GODLOAD!" Says Leon, "I scoff at Mini-Boot!" -
Leon scoffs, but the chips are long gone, just junk food left..

Thanks for that CiH, Vogue back now. I guess I must be the editor of
this file as everyone gives this laptop back to me when they've
finished typing. I hope they don't expect me to check everyone's
spelling :-(

Now the Falcon is doing nothing, and in the mean time we're taking
the wicked piss out of the Edge magazine... Tat bought a copy along.
Why does he want it in the first place???

Hey, cool. God-paint has appeared on the screen. Leon is complaining
how old the version is. Perhaps it's because you haven't sent Chris a
recent one, Leon!!!???

The pile of disks on top of the computer is growing fast. I hope
everyone doesn't get their disks muddled up when it comes to going
home.

Haha Chris' hard disk has temporarily buggered, so we're replacing it
with Kev's while it cools down.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To return to the report text side of things for a little while..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone  is settled in now,  and the final trip of the evening is 
carried out by me (with RiCH helping) to the nearest fish and chip 
shop to get in vast quantities of greasy food which is enjoyed  by 
most of the people here.. Other things that are done include a few 
attempts  to get a screen grab for Asteroidia with  the  Reservoir 
Ripper..  This  is  one of these programs that can be paused,  and 
then resumed,  but with a hugely speeded up soundtrack,  trying to 
pause again crashes the thing!! But we manage it in the end..

Tat  produces  a copy of a German Atari mag,  'ST Computer'  which 
differs  a lot from standard UK productions by including  a  large 
slice of material from the demo making community,  this includes a 
full  several pages report (with photographs) from the Fried  Bits 
III  convention..  This  starts a keen discussion over who is  the 
physically  weirdest  personality on the scene -  details  of  the 
winner  remain classified to avoid upsetting them!  Old copies  of 
Computer  and Video Games,  (1987) and Home Computing Weekly  from 
even  earlier appear..  Tat owns up to owning a Commodore C16 in a 
previous life!!

Some other old coders chat reveals that there are still people out 
there at work on the Commodore 64, including an enterprising coder 
who  managed  to  get 'Obnoxious' style  wobbly  3-D  raster  bars 
by using the keyboard processor on that machine as a dual parallel 
processor! This was even quicker than the version on the Falcon!?

Some  wicked piss-taking of the Edge magazine was  inevitable,  to 
say the least,  as their latest issue had just hit the news stands 
and  had been brought to the party by someone nameless,  but of  a 
very Lancastrian disposition whose pseudonym begins with a 'T'.. I 
also got to see a very early copy of the new issue of Atari World, 
as  Felice managed to get a subscribers copy just in time for  the 
party..

Yellow leaflets promoting the previously mentioned 'Far Out Dadio' 
T-shirts  seemed to spread and multiply and get under  foot..  One 
crumpled  up and thrown across to a far corner of the room  by  me 
was  only rediscovered two weeks later..  These accursed  leaflets 
seemed  to be a new sub-species of Tribble (C.F.  Star Trek,) with 
unlimited reproductive powers..

I knew about the parlous state of my Falcon internal hard drive  - 
it tends to get a bit tricky if overheated!!  ;-(  And it sure did 
a lot of that over the next day!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Back to the realtime article..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guess who is back!!!! (Clue .. I'm in love with a certain actress
called Meredith!

We've got Kev's Falcon plugged in now, to give CIH's a rest -
methinks the power supply may be playing up.....

It's battle of the old mags now .. RiCH Davey has a copy of C&VG from
August 87 and CIH has turned up with a mag called 'Home Computing
Weekly' - mention of the C16 (sorry) has just been made (and
someone's got the farts again cos' there's a huge stink around
here....AAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!

There's a copy of the hated Edge mag (?) here now, but luckily it
does not have any mention of that stupid BBC mascot, Mr Blobby (at
least I hope it doesn't!)

Time is now 12:25 (silent fart here from me, sorry guys) and I'm
going to go soon .. no doubt I'll be back for the party later on
today (whaddya mean it's already started???)

Ta for that little escapade into the realms of beyond Felice!
Thinking of realms, we are current watching the Realms of Depth demo
by Hydroxid. Some nice effects and music, even if sound IS through
the monitor - we haven't plugged the other Falcon into the hi-fi yet!

Have we just worked out the way into a hidden screen?? I dunno??

Nads! The hidden screen contains all old ST chip tunes! Good for old
time's sake I suppose!! Everyone's talking about how they used to rip
the chipzaks.
Tara for now!

~~~

Tat can hit his forehead causing his skull to crack onto the wall -
and this is the future of UK demo coding...

Tasha is sooooo kind letting me sit on my bed.

Why do Commodore feel they have to make keyboards like this...?

Liverpool 4  1 Sheffield Wednesday
Rush 2         Errr, some old bloke
Collymore
Fowler

Goodbye.

VoGue back...

We are looking at Felice's articles for Maggie 18 - they're *really*
good (!) He must have taken ages to type the one on his trip. Oh
well, it's something to fill up the disk.

Doesn't Tronic like to tell us what he's a member of... Effect AND
Kuba AND Arsenic. Soon he'll add 'AND 1st Bromley Scout Group AND My
Mum's knitting club AND The Power Rangers Fan Club'.
Don't worry mate, we love you, lots...

[Time Check 1:47am 19.8.95]

We are into the early hours of the morning now, on the night before
the party. Only seven people in CIH's flat now, who are:-

          Ripley of RG (Tash O'Reilly)
          Mr. Pink of RG (Leon O'Reilly)
          CIH/Maggie (The host)
          Kev
          Tat
          RiCH
          Myself (VoGue)

We are currently looking at RiCH and co's new Falcon slideshow
stunning high res pictures in only 16 colours.
Slightly wierd greetings screen, but still a very original
concept.....

See yas in a tick.....

CiH back - 2.34am ROLL UP, roll up, get your daily sump here.. Leon
has hit a few TOS version related bugs, nothing serious, but slightly
annoying.. Leon is moaning about this.. So I'm being penalised for
being an early adopter and leading the way for others to FOLLOW!

Meanwhile, RiCH is going all retro on us,and has dug out his Speccy
emulator.. Varying success rate with Alien 8 now appearing.. In an
eerie silence, everyone else has stopped work and is looking on in
amazement.. Did you know that there is room in the Falcon DSP's
internal zero wait state memory for the total speccy RAM twice over!!
Yes - 96k, a complete emulation system including ROM should happily
live inside the DSP.. Just think of the blinding speed that 3-D
Starstrike would gain with the 32MHZ!! Totally unplayable, in fact..

Right, I'm a wee bit tired already,and averaging several mistakes a
line, time for a caffeine injection..

Signing off for now- CiH

VoGue...

Just tested the Skynet Times shell on yet another Falcon, and it
works no probs. Tomorrow I'll test it on a TOS 1.6x STE (hopefully).
Then it will have been tested on just about every Atari platform
possible (Expect the TT/Mega - but no-one uses these machines
anyway!).

RiCH is now copying mass amounts of files from Kev's Falcon to his
extenal hard drive. Kev's Falcon has a strange cord coming out of the
top. Most odd - I think it's for the sound.

Now RiCH is fiddling with Apex Media, running his cool animations...

Who can I (we) take the piss out of in the nicest way possible??

How about Vic Lennard?... Chris....?

But he's dead or something, isn't he?

Yes, I think he's going through a dormant stage.
Perhaps he'll return in the Edge magazine???

Don't be silly chappie, dead means dead, but perhaps a spell on
Amstrad Action?

But surely the Amstrad is as dead as Vic is?

The Amstrad is dead
  and so is Vic
   but they were both
    alive at one time
     or other,
  In a place I can't remember
at this time,
 variously..

E.J. Felice aged 3 and a quarter.

Well, that just proves that maybe there is a light at the end of the
tunnel.. I think it's an oncoming train!?

Let's leave that there before it goes any further!!!

VoGue signing off.. [Time Check: 3:41 am - 19.8.95]

The time has come to do something with the good old Delta Force
version of the shell, so me, CIH and Leon will get 2 work on that...

[Time Check: 4.28am]

Well, the ST version of Maggie 18 is almost ready for completion,
just a few more articles to pack. The Falcon version is in need of a
bit more work though....

YYYYYAAAAWWWWWWNNNNNNN!  Good God it's late.. or is it early?  Oh
whatever, all I know is that I'm so tired I'm gonna fall asleep on
the spot.  This is RiCH here by the way.  I've just got an all time
high score on Tautology II, CIH is sat on the floor editing the ST
version of Maggie, Kev and Tash are kinda dozing to sleep on the
settee and others are busy fiddling with computers or sleeping bags.
Still, thats life :)  The coach journey down here was very hot and
boring!  It took about 5 hours too.. that wasn't so good.  Still, its
about 5am now and getting close to when the actual convention starts
for real!  I think I'm gonna get some kip now.. or read a book or
something, I don't know... geeeee... yawwny yawwny.  Anyway I'll
report back tommorow morning, err this morning, oh what the heck I'll
give you some more feedback when some more people arrive and things
get kicking in the hotel!  Bye bye from a sleepy RiCH.

VoGue...

Everyone is now asleep except me, as I've playing around on one of
the Falcons we have here... It seems that the only time I can get on
a computer is when everyone else is asleep. Perhaps I might join
em........

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another  goodish  place  to pick up on the party  report  side  of 
things, as a mass outbreak of 'sleeping' has just hit the realtime 
article..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well Felice went home, and it seemed that things just suddenly got 
that little bit sillier,  another Falcon, with the SVGA was set up 
in  a  corner,  this  was  Kev's machine,  connected  to  Nathan's 
monitor,  with  RiCH  Davey claiming temporary  ownership..  Kev's 
Falcon  does  indeed  have  a lead out of  the  top,  sort  of  an 
umbilical  cable from where the internal speaker used to  be,  for 
the  sound,  as  he managed to shag the headphone  audio/out  port 
whilst putting in the internal hard drive from his old machine..

We got to see Hydroxide running,  and the Psychosis slideshow, and 
also a lust for Speccy games which did stop everyone else in their 
tracks..  The fight to stay awake was aided by a large quantity of 
extra nasty strength expresso filter coffee tasting of  earthworms 
made  by me at just that 'starting to sag' time of night..  (About 
2.30-ish..)  

The  stuff about ZX Spectrum emulators and the DSP  is  reasonably 
self-explanatory, in fact, the quality of reportage seems to go up 
dramatically  in general,  the longer we are up and the more tired 
we get!

I  don't really remember doing a lot on the ST version  of  Maggie 
18,  as  I couldn't really see too much of what I was doing in the 
almost  total  darkness,  broken  only by a  few  faintly  glowing 
monitor  screens..  There  were  just  a  few  last  textfiles  to 
reformat,  pack down,  and stick in,  along with the cover picture 
which  had  come down with Tash (Who was drifting  gently  off  to 
sleep at that time..) I shudder to think what would have  happened 
in  the  way of mistakes and bugs if we tried to assemble  it  all 
from  scratch  that  night!!  Good  job I did most of  it  on  the 
preceding Monday then.. 

Sleep  was not a conscious idea,  it just happened without warning 
to  different people..  I had this vague idea we might try to stay 
up  right  through to morning,  well 5.00am was pretty good  going 
anyway..

Everyone else ekes out a short period of rest on the sofa, chairs, 
or floor,  I take off to my bedroom, with the usual reassuring bed 
between me and discomfort.. Will three short hours prove enough to 
get  them  through  a  very long day  ahead,  will  the  party  go 
according  to  plan,  read on,  and find out in the next  exciting 
installment of..

                 MAGGIE PARTY REAL-TIME ARTICLE!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first session endeth, all sleep, then dawn skips in on tiny feet 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fucking hell!! We've all just been woken up at 7:49am by workers
digging up the road just outside of the window...  It's so darn loud.

Bloody Mother of God.. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT NOISE?  It's like having
a drill hammer slammed through your ears and shaken around a bit. 
Err its morning now, least I think it is.. there hasn't really been a
night so its hard to comment.  My clock tells me its 8.00am exactly,
this is RiCH here, very tired still and gonna go nuts at the complete
and utter wall of noise behind me in the construction sight!!!
Doesn't everyone look shagged out in the morning?  (Tat, Leon :)
There are murmurs of protest from one of the sleeping bags on the
room as Chris tries to cross to the kitchen carrying a load of coffee
mugs, hey, this is high life! [RiCH]

VoGue...

We are now making computing history this morning by having a Falcon
running with an internal HD and two external HD's, totalling over 1.5
gig! We have calculated that you can fit the whole 48k Spectrum RAM
into that 31,250 times!!!

[Time Check: 9:00am 19.8.95]

In a few minutes we'll be going over the road to the hotel room. I'll
talk to you when we get there!!!!

[Time Check: 9.44am]

We are now in the hotel room. None of the others have arrived yet.
I've set up an STfm, so we are looking at Blood by Holocaust...

The hotel staff are regarding us with confused expressions as beeps
emanate from behind the closed door....

If i hear the phrase 'VJ-Day' again I will scream - on current
estimates, it has been uttered approx 1,623 times already today
because we left the radio on while we were sleeping.

Mr Pink/RG : After a pretty sleepless night we have arrived at the
hotel. The new Maggie shell now runs on TOS 4.01 but flickers
horribly when I init the videl. People around me are setting up STs
and I have seen some ST demos by Holocaust for the first time. Cool
stuff. We are currently trying to find a way to interface the coffee
perculator with the Falcon.

CiH - The Avena Fried Bits Demo is running - Tat is scared, Tat has
now left the room.. The time is 10.05am.. By the way, I'm perfectly
fine thanks.. I can report that we have a 99.99% complete ST version
of Maggie, just the README file left to do now, as soon as I can get
these lazy sods sorted out!

CiH - 10.30am now, and still this text has not progressed any
further, this may be related to the amounts of activity going on
around various machines, mostly constructive, and also Vogue (John)
sitting next to me at the moment.. 

The one problem we have hit is a distinct lack of kettle leads, er,
power cables, Richard (Felice) has been sent to get some more..

VoGue...

Now CIH is doing the finishing touches on Maggie 18 ST version. We
just had to dig out an STfm to save the med-res desktop. Chris is
just typing the read.me and then it will be finitoed...

RiCH - Isn't it amusing how we all cap our names?  I mean just look
at this doc file.. VoGue, CiH, RiCH !!!  Can't we type or something?
Mavis Beacon would turn in her grave if she read this :)  

SPIN in her grave matey! - CiH

Shouldn't that be 'Do the highland fling in her grave'? - VoGue

Hello!  Tronic here!  Just to tell you that I've got a PC and won't
ever be using my skills on Maggie everagain!!! HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!

We've just developed the PC-portable plasma (or as a Mac user would
say, the PcPortableMacPlasma - one hand wiggles the contrast control
while the other hand draws trails on the screen - and it's free!
(apart from the price of the batteries) Oh, grub's up as well, the
bar's has opened at 11am which can't be bad?

RiCH - Some more geezers have turned up but no-one knows who they
are, perhaps gate crashers?  I doubt it though, the more the merrier
I say.  Ummm this little laptop is probably the one machine thats
going to get the most use over this entire Atari convention.. ironic
huh?!  It's a Commodore Laptop too, insane huh?  Makes you wanna cry
out traitor at the top of your voice *grin*  Hey I read the book The
Day of the Triffids the other day... superb reading, I recommend it.
Ok bets on as to who will add a bit to this article next... my money
goes on it being VoGue, but now he's seen this he'll probably wait
until someone else kicks something out.  Oh yeah we have a Jaguar,
loads of JagPads, lots of games and... no bloody power lead for it.
Shit, I really wanted to play Iron Soldier too, oh well.  We have a
Lynx power lead... ummm but no Lynx.  Going well huh?  :)  We also
have hard drive overload... I reckon (in true Edge DataFeed style)
that we have about 4 Gig worth of hard drive space already and this
gets increased as we go along.  Time for some massive SCSI chaining..
yeah... software city!  VoGue is scanning through Tronics PD listing,
it looks kinda nice but about the same as any other PD listing run by
a demo freak.  Ho hum, err I'm leaving this now... someone else come
and have a fiddle.. go on, feel my keys, press them in a state of
pure eroticism, delve into their firm softness and warmness now the
fingers of a thousand scantily clad females have danced over them.
Go on.. you know you want to :)

No thanks.

Poor Tat, he just had a beautifully syuncronized death in Super
Starioland.  He's gone to sob...

We've just had an amazing call from James, for some reason he's
managed to get the wrong coach and doesn't know where in the country
he is!!!!!!  Another prob is that Chris has gone to meet him at
Northampton Station, thinking that he will be in soon.  What will
happen now, I wonder??

[Tat] James has discovered his own whereabouts and phoned again.

He's in Somerset.

Yes, you did read that correctly. Somerset. He intends to take a taxi
to Taunton. Hopefully he'll down some cider to calm his nerves (not
making sweeping generalizations about large areas of this country,
honest)

[RiCH] James.. you plonker!!!

What a twozzock that kid is??!!! - VoGue

Where is CIH?

Either in the bathroom or at the bus station. Or maybe his nuts
exploded and he's in casualty.....? - VoGue

Has he been abducted by Amiga/PC/Mac owners?  To be subjected to
several varied methods of torture?  Will we ever know?

Perhaps the Amiga owners are showing him their brilliant operating
system??

Help!  We have a traitor in our midst...

Who?? Is it Tat?? I hear he likes little boys and girls...

[Tat] Yes, a little salt and pepper and a sharp knife, they taste
lovely

move.b (  )+,d1

Man, that Leon's off his trolley...    VoGue

He's just a coder!

I know... Sad isn't it... Don't worry, they might find a cure for
coding one day..  VoGue

How about execution???
They could gas you all at the same time...

Lost Blubb strikes back.... all are watching this monitor with Lazers
'master piece' running on it (again).  The two STE owners are quite
impressed, but we've all seen it so often we know the demo inside out
so its kind of lost its effect, bloody good though.  Felice's
speakers sound shagged from here.  Where the heck is CIH?  He's been
gone for ages!  He was only supposed to go to the train station!  It
can't have taken him THAT long to figure out James had cocked up and
wasn't on the train that arrived like an hour ago.  Oh well, live and
let live and all that.  Bye bye fly.  [RiCH]

In spite of my speakers sounding a little shitty, it is still an
impressive demo ..... apart from it playing there was complete
silence in the room! (Felice)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The morning before, the morning after perhaps!?!..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And back to the report,  to update you at this early stages of the 
party point in the day.. - CiH

My  alarm  got in its retaliation first,  mere seconds before  the 
drilling  started  outside.  it was those lovely cable  television 
people who must really enjoy earning their early morning  overtime 
bonuses or something,  anyway,  it solved the problem of me having 
to  kick  people awake..  An initial reconaissance mission of  the 
Rilton Hotel confirmed that the room I had booked would be  ready, 
and  a hotel manager who looked like he had stayed up most of  the 
night  with us,  unlocked the door,  just time to get the gear and 
people in here now..

The  car  was loaded,  and driven the ridiculously short  distance 
around  the  corner,  then unloaded as we bagged tables to set  up 
on..  Apart from an initial lack in the power leads department, we 
got going quite quickly, first up were several ST demos, with Leon 
glued  solidly to the making of 'Maggie 18,  the '030 years'  once 
more.. I take a decision to cancel the idea of charging people for 
the room, instead, people are responsible for their own food/drink 
purchases whilst they are in here.. Things trickle on quietly, the 
one thing that me and John (VoGue) do manage to accomplish, is the 
the  absolute and final finishing-off process on the  Delta  Force 
version of Maggie 18,  the 'READ.ME' file is written,  the desktop 
saved, and it is VoGue's witty little idea to save the trashcan as 
the  'Edge'  magazine!  We scream "It is ready!" And he starts  to 
copy it..

Felice   turns  up  a  little  while  later,   with  his  hardware 
contributions to the gathering..

On  the arrivals front,  Ralph Lovesey (Impact Software) is due to 
get here c.11.00am,  and two more people will also be coming under 
their  own  steam  this morning..  On the other hand,  that  still 
leaves me to pick up Mike Noyce and James Mathews respectively..

Mike  is  relatively  straightfoward,  he  arrives  on  the  11.30 
Intercity  train  at Wellingborough station..  he is difficult  to 
spot  at  first,  as  a  smallish bloke wearing  a  bright  yellow 
football  shirt  is questioned,  but denies being this person  and 
runs off.. A large and forbidding looking bloke stands waiting, so 
I pluck up courage to ask..  Result! the man himself, who is built 
like a rugby player, but sounds nothing like that over the phone.. 
He  is soon taken back to the hotel and dropped off,  as I have to 
go  and  make the next pick-up from Northampton Bus  Station,  the 
elusive James Mathews!! 

Now if I had got out of the car at that point,  just to look in on 
how  the party was running,  I might have found out about  James's 
cock up,  and the next hour might have gone differently, as it was 
though..

Last night,  with Felice in the driving seat, we manage to fudge a 
parking  spot near the bus station,  where there normally wouldn't 
be one really.. This time, in the daytime, with packs of predatory 
traffic  wardens  seeking  a  kill,  I take no  chances  and  park 
properly   in  the  multi-storey,   yet  more  urban  architecture 
reminiscent of missile silos or U-Boat pens..  The bus station has 
the coach in question, just arrived, but no visible sign of James, 
and thus it remains for the next ten minutes or so..  Eventually a 
uniformed  person gave me the bad news,  James had not managed  to 
catch this particular vehicle,  and I was to return to the hotel.. 
No explanations, and precious little information at this stage..

In  the meantime,  I managed to miss the Sub-Station link up  game 
which commenced with the arrival of Ian Garbutt and Andy Rolfe,  I 
only  pick  up  on them in the final stages of  MIDI-Maze  when  I 
finally  get  back..  Also Ralph does arrive sometime around  this 
point,  so  'Team'  features  very  prominently for  much  of  the 
afternoon period..

Swearing  under  my  breath,  a  charge  back  eastwards  is  only 
interrupted momentarily as one jerk decides to slow down by  about 
40mph  in  the overtaking lane,  immediately in front of  me..  He 
changes lane,  does not want to miss his exit it seems, preferring 
the prospect of certain death instead.. Whilst I am too shocked to 
do  anything,  he gives a feeble wave as if to say "Thanks for not 
killing me as a result of my inane driving!"

Anyway,  the  next bit of the realtime article sums up the  effect 
all this had on me pretty succinctly..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The afternoon..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CiH, It is now 1.00pm..

CiH finally back- I love wasted journeys, I'm having a realtime
gibbering fit having got back from all too sunny Northampton
Jamesless! Bugger bugger bugger!!!

I'm somewhat amused to hear about HOW he cocked up though.. Fancy
ending up in Zummerset, and this boy wants to be a software
publishing multi-tedia baron by the time he's twenty-five!!

Mike Noyce at the keyboard!! Wow! I never thought I'd be doing
something like this when I was reading the real-time articles in ST
NEWS (hi Richard!!) all those years ago.

I've been here a while now. I've met Chris, who picked me up from
Wellingborough Station and Richard (Felice). I've had a look at
Maggie 18 and the new Falcon shell - very impressive. Kev Davies, you
better get that RAM upgrade for your Falcon or *the* photo will be
submitted for the next issue - Blackmail!!

More from me later. Ta-ta. [Mike]

[Felice] It's 1.35 pm now, and I'm starting to feel hungry so I think
I'll order some food soon.  A lot of the people here have been
gorging on sausage and chips ... but whether I will order any is a
different matter.  No, I'm not skint, don't worry about that!

Mike Noyce is sitting to the side of me now reading thru Maggie 18 -
and he appears to be enjoying it!  Apart from saying a few minutes
ago that he wanted a Falcon after seeing the Lost Blubb demo - and a
little moan about being a poor student and all that he's fairly
quiet.

It's amazing just how everything is going here .. after the police
activity last night Rushden is quiet.  The reason for the holdup was
that there was a fatal accident involving a boy racer in an XR3i and
a 6 year old kid who just happened to be crossing at a pelican on
Rushden's unofficial 'race track'.

VoGue...

And now for a mid-party report....

[Felice] Well, I've had my chicken nuggets and chips now .. after
getting them back from a combination of Leon and CIH.  Never mind,
they still taste nice....

M-m-m-mike is back. I need fooooood! Let the food quest begin. [Mike]

Timecheck - 3.00pm - Cih back at the keys again, and we are in the
mid-afternoon 'slump zone' where not a lot happens.. Alright, a
fiercely fought 'Team' campaign is going on between Ralph 'I made
this game so I've got to be good at it' Lovesey, and Leon 'eat footy
games for mid-day repast' O'Reilly.. Leon has just won a match 3-0
which would show that at least Reservoir Gods have got the top
computer footy demon.. Can Ralph get the situation back in his
favour, or will it run completely out of his control.. Stay tuned
folks!!

John (Vogue) works on Dpaint on some graphics for an intro, RiCH
Davey seems to be using my Falcon to hit on Falcon STOS
incompatibility problems for his own strange amusement..

The two dudes who turned up are Ian Garbutt and Andy Rolfe who are
STE MIDI-Maze nuts, and have a taste for wargames.. A long campaign
is going in in their corner at this time.. Everyone else seems to be
watching the Team battle, or me doing this..

The 'Get a Life course' will be running from next week!! But
seriously,it is damp dishcloth sitting in an oven weather, much too
hot and humid, not the ideal day to be A:- Tired from too little
sleep,and B:- Sitting here sweating over a computer keyboard..  Not
as nice as it ought to be..

Some more arrivals should be with us for early evening, and hopefully
it will be a bit livelier all round.. Or die trying..

Mike here - it's getting hard to think of original intros to indicate
that I'm now typing - the beginnings of an inspiration block. I have
returned from my quest with enough junk food to see me through. Chris
is right about the weather. I was fairly cool until I went out into
the blazing sunlight. It's damn hot (and (s)we(a)t)!! I think an
ice-cold Coke would do nicely about now.

As Richard wrote earlier, I have read Maggie 18 more closely after my
initial browse. Pretty good, probably the best issue yet - creep,
creep. (I actually wrote this paragraph a while back, but it
disappeared?!) [Mike]

The Team match seems to be on hold, while everyone takes a break in
the heat, talking instead and sipping Coke and other beverages.

[Felice] Where is Mark of POV???

Also, where is a certain editor of POWER??? He rang from Taunton
about, uh, two, maybe three hours ago ... we've heard nothing from
him since.....Where are you James????
(quote courtesy of C4's 'The Big Breakfast')

There is football news on the radio right now, but no-one seems to be
talking about it ... maybe they're all bored.

Ian Garbutt and his mate - who were the STE owners that were very
impressed by the Lost Blubb demo - are now packing up .. they seem to
have enjoyed the party.  I've been showing Ian how to master AtariNOS
(Demon's Internet software for the Atari) as he'd been having some
problems.

Well, it's 3.45pm, considering that there was not much in the way of
sleep gained by too many people save me, no-one appears to have
dropped off yet ..... Even Tash is still awake.

We've missed ITV's The Chart Show ... from what I understood Weird Al
made a welcome re-appearance with his new song and video .. yes it
was 'Jurassic Park' which is hopefully on sale now here in the UK.

Another greet - this time to Ursula and Lutz Koch of the Tommy Lee
Jones Gazette .. who surprised me very much this past week with a
tape (that arrived on 17.8.95) containing a certain film starring the
girl I love called Meredith .. yes, that movie was called 'April
Morning'.  You'll see the review in this issue, as I will make a note
now to write it ASAP.

It's a travesty that this movie was not released on video ... it
really is a superb, atmospheric movie ... and check out the welcome
appearance of The Kiss's Nicholas Kilbertus (who played Meredith's
father in the hit horror movie).  Yes, the movie does remind me
slighly of Sharpe .. starring Sean Bean ... but he is not in it.
The people who are in it are (from Dream A Little Dream) Meredith
Salenger, Susan Blakely, & (from The Kiss) Vlasta Vrana, Nick
Kilbertus and some others.

Read more in the review!!!!!!

At the moment, CiH is currently looking at a preview version of
Skynet Times .. and I think he likes it.

Put it this way, I HOPE he does!!!

BTW, the Team contest has now resumed .. Leon looks like is trying to
drink either his first pint of Guinness, or that must be Coke he is
drinking.  He's also looking slightly dazed .. maybe a night without
sleep is starting to get to him.

Mike: I've just been reading Richard's copy of Atari World - the best
ST Mag!! There's a review of ST NEWS in there, which will please Mr.
Karsmakers, I'm sure. Though he might be less pleased with some of
the comments made. For example: "...Boringly GEM standard." and
"...not a single image is used...". I guess Richard will answer these
in the next issue, due later this year.

I've had a couple of ideas for things to appear in the next issue
(Already - shock, horror!?!) which I've mentioned to Chris. Whether
or not I actually get any of them done, before the deadline is
another matter entirely. Still, Chris proved quite effective when
nagging me over the last couple of weeks!!

[RiCH] - Bugger me backwards, its boiling hot.. I'm off for a coke!

Ahhhh... much better.. its 1.60p for a pint of coke with ice, kinda
expensive, but nice and cold and in this heat quite frankly I don't
give!  I wonder where James has got too?  He's a nut case, quite
truly.  We have loads of software to show him and he should have
demos of his new games on his hard drive... BUT... he ain't here!!!
Doh!  What a plonker, how could he get the wrong coach?  He's mad,
truly!  I'd wonder what he's like when he's organised?  (actually I
doubt he ever is organised!).

Hmmm shouldn't we be ordering masses of pizza now or something?  We
are drinking lots of coke (and Irn Bru!  *spew*) but not a
traditional pizza in sight!  Whatever next?  *grin*  There's
something beautifully hypnotic about the way in which the bubbles
float to the top of the pint glass in a tumbler of coke.  The way
they bounce off the little ice cubs and richocet around the place,
cute!  Oh yeah, CiH's internal IDE drive on his Falcon doesn't boot
any more, I havn't had the heart to tell him this yet though so I'm
hoping he won't notice, or that when it cools down it'll be working
again.  It is a really tempremental drive, believe me, you can be
accessing a file on it one second then BOOM, it stops dead. 
Wonderful, just wonderful.  Well I've a packet of nice chocolate
biscuits and even some choccy rolls, but its too hot for them.

Hey I just read something on the computer next to me that said there
is a wealth of talent in .net magazine.  Ummmm really!!  Someone like
to tell me where?!  :)

RiCH over and out (for now) going to sip coke and bask in the warmth
of my monitor glow.  Good for your skin, UV protection factor 030 :)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not  really  too much to do in the report here,  like last  night, 
when people got stressed out from tiredness, or from the heat, the 
standard  of  what was written went up three thousand  percent  so 
there's not a lot left that I have to fill in on!! 

Still, let's do what we can..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'

The all important matter of food.. That's always a safe topic..

Some  of us decided to go with what the hotel had to offer..  They 
did  quite a nice chicken nuggets with chips (in a basket)..  Mine 
tasted very nice,  Felice felt that his would taste better if they 
were left for an hour so so! What a silly nugget he was!

Others  wandered over to the local 'Quiksave' supermarket  to  see 
what  they had to offer,  and indeed in the fullness of time  RiCH 
and  VoGue  shambled back in with tons of cheap  and  garish  junk 
food,  and  'Irn  Spew'  to wash it down with,  in a follow-up  on 
Sunday Morning, most of this food stayed with me, so it was crisps 
and Bakewell tarts for tea for much of the next week after..  (Not 
to mention the Jammie Dodgers, ohhh God! The Jammie Dodgers!!)

Ian  and Andy left,  but other guests were still expected for  the 
evening period..

It was very hot now,  and the lack of sleep really started to tell 
on  everyone in the mid-afternoon period..  Time for a very  large 
glass of coke, and a chat with RiCH to revive drooping spirits..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Back to the realtime thingy..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VoGue...

Two other people have just walked in with a hard drive. I'll find out
who they are...
Sod it! I'll talk to those guys in a mo. At the mo, I'm packing all
of Maggie 18 ST Version into a ZIP file for easy copying...
Long wait........

CiH back on - It's Dave and Mark, just doing a 'flying visit' but
with a very welcome CD-ROM  drive for my Falcon.. We may hopefully
see them a bit later, say about 7 or 8 o'clock, if not, then never
mind.. Catch them later or something.. Least they did make the
effort..

Mike: Why the bloody 'ell do ice-cubes glue themselves to the bottom
of the glass when you are desperate to suck on them in order to cool
down?!

While you consider that question, here's another philosophical
thought. The world's governments are (apparently) fighting global
warming by reducing the levels of pollution. Mother nature has
decided to fight it her own way by reducing male fertility, removing
the pollutors!! Gosh! I frighten myself sometimes, I really do. It
must be the heat.

Things seem to be picking up a bit again. The noise of converstion is
filling the room, people are playing Team again, and Chris is trying
out his new CD-ROM on one of the Falcons in the room. I'll go over
and have a look myself.

Well I drew on TEAM, but what is really bugging me is: Where is Tommy
of Avena?

It's Liverpool 1  Sheffield Wednesday 0...Stan the Man!!!
Who the fuck are Man United?!  Villa 3 United 1!!!
Leicester City 2 Stoke City 3 (Leicester were robbed !) 

Mike: Chris' new toy seems to be working. He is currently working his
way through a few CDs. That should keep him busy for a while.

[tAt] The Clarets hold Stockport to a 0-0 draw in the glamour tie of
the day. All smiles in the Burnley team, shame about Man Utd eh? No?

[Felice] Unfortunately, I'm one of those few people who are
uninterested in football ... but what the heck, I don't think many
people are listening to it anyway.

Just been looking at the CD-ROMs that we can now use .. first one
happens to be, yes, it is a porno one called 'Hot Licks' or
something.  According to RiCH it's a massive pile of zipfiles that
unpack to a fair size.  The second one happens to be Michael
Burkley's compilation of his US PD library .. some comments have been
made that it is slightly out of date as far as the demos go BUT a
good plus point is that everything can be run from the CD.
Well, almost everything, anyway....

I've been talking to Dave & Mark for a bit now .. and they told me
about Mercury's new deal on cheaper phone calls .. even cheaper than
BT rates (even though they are now OK).  Maybe I'll check it out
soon.

Question: Where is Mark of POV?  I thought he was coming?

Where is Michael Schussler?  With porno CDs circulating, I'm
surprized he's not left Germany and come running...

When will the TEAM league end?  And who will win?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Leon certainly!! Anyway, it is back for a quick burst at the post-
party mortem analysis thing..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dave  and  Mark  turn  up with my new  CD-ROM  drive,  the  latest 
addition to the little family of storage devices clustered  around 
my Falcon.. They only drop in for a quick visit, but stay a little 
while  anyway..  As  my  Falcon is preoccupied  with  Leon  either 
debugging  the  new  Maggie shell,  or  playing  'Team',  Felice's 
machine is pressed into service and some serious chaining of  SCSI 
external  devices  takes  place..   Most  usefully,  a  number  of 
different CD-ROMs are present for viewing purposes,  including one 
or two with certain kings of 'artwork' shall we say!! 

A Gareth has to be collected from Kettering at around 6.15pm,  and 
this  goes  straightforwardly,  unlike a certain other person  who 
remains lost in Taunton at this time..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anyway we are getting ahead of ourselves a little bit,  because as 
Mike says back in the realtime world..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mike: It's 6:00pm!!!

and?

Somebody SLAUGHTER David Mellor.

Davud Mellor is the football fans' friend.

What about the football fans' enemies...?  Kill all y'all!

"Tat's tunnels are twice the speed of ordinary big box tunnels...
and they actually work out cheaper than shop's own brands."

VoGue...

...Back on the keyz at last, after what seemed like ages. I've
compiling Maggie 18, ZIPping it, and copying it around to people at
the party. Now RiCH is hogging the CD-Rom, copying megs and megs onto
his hard disk. Someone else has come along, called Gareth. He has
some other CD's, so I might do some copying......

There are lots of good GIF pictures on this Hot sound and vision two
CD. There's also lots of crap. But that's just the way it goes, eh???

Mike: It's now 6:54pm and the room we're in has returned to a much
more comfortable temperature, i.e. it's not as hot as the surface of
the sun anymore, thank god.

7:00PM ...er well, that's about it really.  Tat's demo effects are
coming along quite nicely, but I won't say what they are incase it's
classified inf. which it is likely to be as he wants to beat eKo.,
which although within the realms of possibility, could be a Tat
difficult....

VoGue...

We are playing stardust of the 1040STE next to me. I've seen it
before, so I won't bother playing it....



Why does Stardust seem remarkably similar to Astroidia?

Say cheese

And why does Astroidia seem remarkably similar to Astroids?...
Could there be an uncanny link?

Newsflash!!  Phone for CIH! Could it be James?  Is he in England?

In England ???  James ???  He has the Power to go anywhere (except
where he's supposed to be).

Well, It appears that James is no longer coming to the Maggie party.
At half past seven he's still in Taunton where he was at lunchtime...

CiH:- James has managed to remain stuck in Taunton.. He would still
like to try to come here, but having spoke to him, I convinced him (I
hope) that he is better off NOT trying.. There is no way that he
would get there before midnight, on Monday, in September, next year..

The plain fact is that James has totally lost his bearings, along
with his marbles and the power to get here in one piece...Vogue

CiH - The time is 7.45pm, or 7.51pm if you choose to believe RiCH's
PC system clock, the atmosphere is holding well, people are occupied,
able to breath and move again, and from outside the room, several
signs of life stir in the hotel at large.. Several bison roam across
the plain, the finished Falcon Maggie looms ever nearer, apart from
the fact that it seems to perform slightly differently on one
individual's hard drive (Hi Kev!)

Will Leon ever take off that overlarge baseball cap that makes him
look ten years old? Will Mike Noyce un-engross himself with Stardust?
All these and other questions remain a mystery..

I think the little matter of a three hour STOS game competition has
arisen! Development time!!

Mike: I have indeed dragged myself away from Stardust. Better let
someone else have a go - some of them need the practice. ;-) Not that
I'm that good.

[Felice] So far, the new Maggie shell seems to work without any
problems! - and yes, you can believe that.  Put it this way, if a
program (any program on any system) is bugged, I'm going to find it.
Why the fuck these massive companies who design and sell shit
software get away with it so easily??  This seems to be a problem
only confined to the UK.  As Nirvana said, nevermind......

[RiCH] Who the fuck wrote the above bit of shit???

CiH has told me that it is my turn to take Ralph back to Syresham ..
he'll come with us to make sure that we don't get lost.  Unlike a
certain editor of POWER, I don't think we can!!!!

Question: Where the hell is Mark of POV? He was supposed to be here!

Like a lot of people who said they would.  Again, as Nirvana said,
nevermind...

However, it's no big tragedy.......that quote came from 'Dream A
Little Dream' from Vestron or First Independent....

RiCH - Does ANYONE know just what the hell Dream a Little Dream is
all about?  Sounds a bit shit to me... like Mystic Pizza... with no
pizza or mystic stuff probably... ho hum....

Mike: "Anyone can navigate if he can tell his arse from his elbow." -
Blackadder Goes Forth quote in reference to a certain person.

CiH:- I don't think James has got that far in his basic bodyparts
recognition classes though! "Erm,let me see, the hip bone's connected
to the ear bone - Oh bugger, I'm lost!"

We're going to have to get Leon and co. on here a bit later, they've
not been seen lately (disapproving tuts..)

VoGue...

RiCH is getting into his 3-hour stos game (8.45pm) and it's called
'Sim Maggie'. More about that when it's finished later on tonite...

Leon is still slaving away over the Maggie shell, while Kev and
Ripley are having a chat about Pamela Anderson. Tat has just come
back after taking a slash...

I would take this laptop around the room, but the batteries are
running low so I best stay by the plug and let it charge up...

After CIH has ran a few people home, and Rich has finished the game,
we'll finish up here at the hotel. We'll take one or two computers
back to CIH's flat so we don't get bored during the night. I very
much doubt we'll get any sleep at all!!!

Man, boredom club starts here!!! There's not really much going on at
all here at the moment... I guess I should walk around and see if
ANYONE is doing anything interesting... It's because there aren't
many people here. A certain guy with the initials JLM is lost in
Taunton, POV haven't turned up ... and nor has anyone else really.
The odd few insignificant peoples have passed through during the
afternoon, but apart from that, there's been no-one really
interesting expect the people included in this article ..

I wish Kev would turn either the brightness or contrast on his hair
down... It's blinding me shiteless!!!

Good mother...  Leon has taken his childish hat off.. I don't believe
it. Maybe all that coding is doing his head in?....

Time check 9.16pm..  Rich's game is coming on nicely. Still plenty of
time... We don't get chucked out until 11.00pm.

While Felice is away, his video camera along with offending video of
today have appeard and CIH is attempting to digitise some pictures.

BIG QUESTION OF THE NIGHT
-------------------------

Take it away, CIH.....

          "Do bears shit in the woods?"






Help! We're being shot!!

Why do people always tap their feet to crap music?

Why is there crap music?

Let's be philisophical...

Let's not actually.

We're being shot again!!!
There's no blood...yet.

Oh NO!! It's Y. M. C. Fuckin' A.!

Mike: OH NO!!! I've been imortalized on video!!!!

Gareth logs on!!Question: Where is pixie of Wellingborough Computer
Club Fame ?, also has he still got the same orange tee-shirt on as he
had last time I meet him in 1992 !?

CiH:- I don't know, and I'm not too bothered about him.. I think that
he is still very short and somewhat challenged in the wit and
interest department.. Nothing changes there really..

Gareth:- Still no sign of Felice from his trip to Northampton, lets
hope his navigation skills are of a better quality than James "some
where lost in Taunton'ish" Matthews.

Mike: Bong! Bong! Bong! It's now 10:09pm!! Almost time to move on to
another venue, i.e. Chris' flat.

Gareth:- Question to Felice(to be answered on his return from the far
flung reaches of Northampton), What did happened to the follow up of
that highly rated demo you coded called "Bud The Chud" ?

Wow.. either this coke is spiked or the contrast on this LCD just
melted through my eyes and back... hmmmm lets go play vampire
somewhere warm and cosy.  These guys keep walking in and having a
look at all the computers and stuff in here.. they look odd.  There
are lots of people doing the Twist in the other room, it reminds me
of a hundred and one wedding receptions I've been hauled to over the
years [RiCH]

Where's Felice?  I want to get him drunk and video him dancing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
That  could be the quote that sums up the event,  either that,  or 
'Taunton', followed by an outburst of uncontrollable sniggering if 
James Matthews is in the room..  Anyway, back to the party report, 
now in the dying stages of the hotel room..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Other  things are done now,  various people take turns to hog  the 
CD-ROM  and copy heaps of stuff off it onto various external  hard 
drives  they  brought  along for the occasion..  The lone  STE  is 
force-fed 'Stardust', and Mike Noyce takes up the challenge.. RiCH 
amuses himself with a 'three hour STOS game challenge', and starts 
something  called  'SIM Maggie',  which is a grippingly  realistic 
text  adventure  sort of thing of the trials and  tribulations  of 
being  a  successful Maggie editor,  probably,  only half a  dozen 
people  will ever get the joke,  and I must ring RiCH sometime  to 
see if he ever finished it??

The room temperature is now 'bearable',  not able to reduce people 
to puddles of liquid goo anymore..

Felice takes Ralph home, cheers mate!! I stay behind..

About  this time,  Leon's headgear finally parts company with  its 
host.. A similar relationship is enjoyed by the 'Alien' Facehugger 
with  its victim,  but as far as we could tell,  nothing burst out 
from the inside of Leon in a shower of blood and internal organs.. 

James  Matthews  rings up at 7.30pm still stuck in the  depths  of 
Taunton,  he is still incredibly talking in terms of being able to 
get  to Northampton,  even now,  but I talk him out of that idea.. 
You can imagine that a lot of the rest of the realtime article was 
taken up with taking the piss out of James..

In  the  main  hotel,  a  disco starts,  it seems to be run  by  a 
necrophiliac disk jockey whose playlist includes several corny old 
long  dead  dogs  of songs,  commented variously in  the  realtime 
text..  The  sordid possibility of a 'wedding reception' cannot be 
ruled out!

Felice's camcorder, and 'Expose' box comes out of hiding.. After a 
little fiddling to set up Expose,  Apex Media,  and the camcorder, 
we  are  ready  to digitise evidence  of  the  days  proceedings.. 
Looking at the film Felice shot, which was mainly crowd scenes, we 
opt for several revealing portraits of the individual participants 
remaining,  some of which may be seen here! The two worst ones are 
easily Leon,  who looks like he is about to chew someones leg off, 
and Kev, who is giving the camera the finger..

And yes, bears do excrete in wooded areas!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And  so  it is time to return to the cramped  confines  of  no.84, 
North  Street..  We decide to bring the gear home,  even though we 
can  leave it overnight in the hotel..  We decide that the room is 
not  that  well defended and don't want to give  any  unscrupulous 
characters  the chance to help themselves..  So it is a session of 
loading and unloading once more, a final check around to make sure 
nothing is left behind, and back home again.. And also back to the 
realtime article as well..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RiCH - We've had a minor set-back in that we've lost a bit of text
during transit from the hotel to this flat.  Oh well, life goes on,
it wasn't very interesting stuff anyway *he he he*  Chris is busy
fiddling with his Falcon and everyone else is sat around looking very
tired and worn out and soon to be hot and bothered.  I'm sleeping in
the bath.  Oh yeah there was a nice argument about who is the best
band/style of music so here is my contribution.... personal fav's
include FSOL, F242, Front Line Assembly, NIN, PWEI, Therapy? Tori
Amos, Kate Bush, Amy Grant, Utah Saints and more.

Oh yes - CIH's monitor has died.. the first hardware casualty of the
evening, the poor little Philips has buggered up.  We are replacing
it with a SVGA, ain't this fun?  Makes us look like conventional PC
owners with all these SCSI hard drives, CD-Roms and SVGA's laying
around.  Icky Icky Icky.

Where's the birthday cake?  *grin*

Ok someone else take over this crap.

Vogue... Can't you handle the pressure RiCH??
Now the Falcon's up 'n running, Leon (surprise, surprise) is first
on, so I'll just sit back and type on this thing forever...
RiCH is earnistly looking through CIH's diskette package-box-thing.
We are discussing the dodgyness of hard drives. CIH's internal IDE
wins as it often fails to boot at all :)

Kev's Falcon is replacing CIH's now as CIH doesn't have devpac
available on the internal drive like Kev does. When it comes to
debugging the Maggie shell, Devpac can be usefull..

Silence has now entered the room as Leon is plugging and unplugging
cables.
We have to sort out what time we're all going home.. Me and RiCH are
being annoying and going at 8.55am, so Cih has to get up aswell to
give us a lift to the bus station..

[Felice] In answer to your question RiCH, Dream A Little Dream is one
hell of a movie that you ought to see sometime.  It's a pity I didn't
bring it round with me to the party .... like a lot of people you
would have drooled over certain people involved in the movie but not
much more ... unlike me, who has received from Meredith's agent
notification of her next movie.

No Gareth, 'Bud The Chud' sequel is not ready yet .... but the movie
sequel arrived on my desk during last week, so, once I get it seen,
who knows?

Everyone is wondering what to write about in the scrolltext for the
new shell version of Maggie.  Names like STOSSER come to mind, I
think.

Gareth is reading in depth what looks like a copy of NME .. I haven't
read one of those for years.   Now the infamous name of Vic Wright
from ye olde and lamented ST Handbook has been mentioned .. something
to do with finances being slightly out of sync with reality.

When dreams are this real, who needs reality???? (Another quote from
Dream A Little Dream)

I also hear the sad news that Caspian has gone bust .. it seems that
Ralph did not tell anyone else about that.

Gareth has just slumped down on the carpet with a loud fart. 
Methinks he wins the prize for 'loudest yawner at a party'

Gareth has now just awoken.

Vogue is about to finish his part of the scrolltext .. and Mike Noyce
is sitting quietly .. at least he was, he's just spoken for the first
time since we arrived in Chris's flat.

Rich Karsmakers has not minded the fact that I altered one of his
original articles .. now he has asked for permission to include it in
ST News.  Sure, Rich, you can, but I thought you were going to
interview me as well? (HINT HINT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ED-  WHAT are you babbling on about here?!?!?  Since when has  the 
mighty  Richard K.  needed to get permission to use one of his own 
articles from you!?!? You only added a few lines anyway??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vogue has just beaten Kev to the loo - and there are some amazingly
loud farting noises coming from that part of the flat .. now Kev is
in and ready to roll.

Vogue looks calm, he must have had a good dump....methinks

Leon has just tried to assemble the scrolltext - and it has failed on
a line.  Like the old Delta Force code, if an apostrophe is missing
Devpac 3 will find it!!!!

We're watching Tat's intro for Maggie 18 now . even though I've seen
it a few times it is still enjoyable to watch, like Meredith Salenger
in fact!

Kev is now out of the toilet ... who's next?

Tat?

Gareth reckons Donkey Kong Country on SNES is good.

Phone rings

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~   ED- A Richard Karsmakers speaks to the gathering awhile..   ~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The monitor thing was not the disaster I feared, after being given 
a little while (two weeks !) to 'think things over' whilst I  used 
Nathan's   SVGA,   it  sprang  back  into  life..   The  technical 
explanation  was  apparently  a  massive  build-up  and   eventual 
discharge of static electricity which sent the tube into 'hangover 
mode', but with no nasty long-term consequences..

With  reference  to  the  flatulence theme  in  some  of  Felice's 
contributions  to the realtime text,  I get the feeling he  lifted 
the idea from the DBA Fried Bits III realtime text without  really 
getting  conclusive  evidence in the first place..  If anyone  was 
producing really nasty noises and smells from their bottom, we ALL 
would have known about it in this very crowded room!

Tiredness,  this  was  getting to people a lot quicker  than  last 
night,  faced  with  a second night without proper rest..  Kev and 
Tash  managed to make a little nest in the kitchen  area,  falling 
off  to sleep very quickly,  and blocking off access to the fridge 
and other vital areas at the same time, the other major casualties 
before  the  end of the evening were Gareth and RiCH,  (Who had  a 
beautiful  line  in  snoring!)  who  both  slept  where  they  had 
initially sat down..

Rich Karsmakers rang up by prior arrangement at around 1.00am, and 
after speaking to people like Mike Noyce and Felice,  I even got a 
few words in with him.. At least his voice made it to the party!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And we return to the realtime text, which is about to burn up with 
one last blaze of glorious creativity, and a sort of conclusion..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

***** /// DESERT ISLAND DISKS with Sue Crawley \\\ *****

RiCH here - I've had an idea... DESERT ISLAND DISKS - If you could

ftp.demon.co.uk....pub.atari.diskmags.

My final greets before I go are as follows [this is Felice here, BTW]

CiH, Leon, Tash (asleep), Kev (asleep), Gareth (loudly snoring...I
presume he's also asleep), RiCH (semi-asleep), Tat, Mike Noyce (who
seems to be bright and awake), Del & Thelma.....hope the wedding
anniversary went OK, Joanna Pacula, Meredith Salenger, Corey Feldman,
Corey Haim, Beavis & Butthead.

Greets also fly from here to the town called Taunton, where James
seems to have been stuck to .... when's the wedding, James??

And with that I'll sign off.  I love you Meredith!!!!!!!!

Vogue.... Thanks for that Felice... *greatly* appreciated...

We may well be approching the end of this real time article as
everyones very tired and we've copied Maggie umpteen times....

Felice was certified shortly after writing this docfile (2.07am.)

We decided on a mass signing off session (of those who are still
awake!) to end this file....

Be happy, suck slapppy, and shut thy trap! VoGue...

ZZzzzZZZ *Snork!* - RiCH Davey..

Overandout! See ya later Alligator - CiH..

Mike: Hope you enjoy this. Time to sleep - not until tomorrow!

TaT: Looks like the end, though I'm not tired. I could even keep
going for........

it is, in the words of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, "Bwyd Time"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And I think that was that.. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This last burst of the night culminates in the final finishing  of 
the Falcon version of Maggie!  That,  as they say,  is that..  The 
next  lengthy period of time is taken with 'FastCopy' onscreen  as 
the  newly minted Maggie '030 clones itself several times  to  the 
general satisfaction of the multitude..  With Felice off home,  it 
is not too hard for people to persuade themselves to find a  space 
to sleep in..  Indeed, RiCH Davey is sawing logs in his sleep.. So 
I  leave them to it..  A whole five hours before I have to get  up 
and take RiCH,  Gareth,  and VoGue to the bus station, so it is up 
at 8.00am for me..  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following morning, almost a proper nights sleep.. Almost..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aftermath..
Alarm clock,  8am, no drills this time, and so I shake RiCH and co 
awake although I recall VoGue had some kind of loud device to wake 
him as well..  The others stir momentarily,  but slumber on..  The 
first  trip back takes RiCH,  VoGue and Gareth to the bus station, 
no  incident,  no  problem..  I make my own way slowly back  home, 
stopping  to  pick up a paper,  and getting my head back down  for 
some more semi-sleep..

About  10.30am,  some  of  the others start to come out  of  their 
comas.. Breakfast takes the form of coffee and birthday cake, with 
candles,  and  photographed..  Next  to go back are Tat,  Kev,  and 
Mike,   who   conveniently  fit  into  another  carload  back   to 
Northampton..  Just  Leon  and  Tash left now,  and they  keep  me 
company until early evening.. With the sudden reappearance of room 
to spare,  they are able to relax a bit more,  and the time passes 
pleasantly enough until I take them back to the station.. 

Once  I  get home,  it is very quiet,  unnervingly so,  for someone 
used  to the very 'in your face' presence of several people  in  a 
small space..  One last thing to do, check to see if James Mathews 
got home, and he did, but will he be able to live down his loss of 
direction? No, he's got the Power, but not the co-ordinates!  

One  niggling  point,  there  were some weird people who  used  my 
bathroom,  as  the soapdish seemed to get filled with water,  with 
the  bit of soap therein crying for help as it slowly drowned  and 
lost  its  flavour  (no,  don't  ask!) Who was  the  mystery  soap 
drowner!!??!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In conclusion..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  party  went  surprisingly well,  considering what is  was  up 
against..  The  main  aim was the successful launch of the  Falcon 
Maggie shell,  and this took off nicely in the time allowed.. Most 
of  the  ancillary  events took place,  although  the  total  non-
appearance  of Top Byte Software's proprietor  and  representative 
made a pigs ear of that part of the invitation..

There was a good choice of people invited, nobody ended up stabbed 
in  a  jealous frenzy by other members of the  party,  nobody  was 
mugged  for  their Falcon,  (almost) nothing blew up,  a large and 
satisfactory realtime article was written..  As far as I can tell, 
everyone  had  a good time,  most of the time at least..  The only 
area  for improvement would have been in the numbers  that  turned 
up..  Never  intended  as a huge event to start with,  it was made 
less  huge  by the lack of certain participants,  but  less  about 
James,  he  really  is starting to cry now,  every time we mention 
'Taunton!'  A  few  other  invited bodies  would  have  been  very 
welcome,  but  would  we have had people actually sleeping in  the 
bath? Probably!!

Would I do it again? - Erm, ask me that again in a while!!

Leon, Gareth, Kev, and Tat on the realtime text..
