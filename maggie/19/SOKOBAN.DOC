                               SOKOBAN
                               -------

Sokoban is  a  puzzle  game  originating  from  Sweden.  If  you don't
recognised the name, you will still  certainly recognise the game. You
have to push blocks around a  small  maze  to a certain location. Once
blocks become trapped in corners you  can't  move  them any more. It a
basically a game of logical thinking,  but  one  that can be both very
frustrating and very addictive.

Sokoban is not new to the  Atari,  perhaps the most famous version was
featured on the Syntax Terror  demo  by  Delta  Force  and I hear that
German coding team Absence have released  a commercial version for the
Falcon.

This particular version was coded  by  Johan  Sprang (of Inner Circuit
Explorers) with graphics by Mandus  Skon  (Impulse).  There is no real
front end to the game  -  you  are  presented  with a Gem dialogue box
followed by some text, then a  file  selector is called every time you
want to load a new level. There  is  perhaps a level of polish missing
from the presentation.

The plot is quite amusing - you  are  Bobbie The Hippie Ghost and have
to hide your peace signs before you get raided. Makes perfect sense!

The game itself is fine - the graphics are nicely defined and it plays
just as well as any  other  version  of  Sokoban.  It  runs on STE and
Falcon, so the graphics are only 16 colour. There is no sound.

The good point about having the  file  selector is that you can create
your own levels and load them in.  There are instructions given on how
to make Sokoban levels and  it  seems straightforward enough (even for
me!)

Like Ishido, it  would  be  nice  if  the  creators  of  the  game had
forgotten about the ST and plunged entirely into the Falcon world with
true colour graphics,  some  nice  sound  and  some  nice effects. But
forgive them this as they have a  great little game on their hands. If
you haven't played this before, get hold of it. Even if you have, give
it another go - it is nice to be acquainted again with old friend, and
a very entertaining one at that.
