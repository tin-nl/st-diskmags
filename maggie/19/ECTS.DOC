Confident  statements made in the 'Next Issue' text have  a  nasty 
habit of rebounding on you.. Who remembers this one?

"The  European Computer Trade Show,  will we be there?  You bet we 
will!"

Well  we  didn't,  it seemed that with no definite sign  of  Atari 
there,  there  would not be a lot of point in going down to  bathe 
ourselves in yet more Playstation and Windows 95 hype.. As late as 
one  or two days before the event,  it was only advised to us that 
Atari would be 'somewhere' in the area!!  Great,  like 'somewhere' 
in the UK perhaps??

The  other  factor which mitigated against us going down  was  the 
fact  that  the organisers had had a clearout of the  'fast  lane' 
ticket system,  so everyone was invited to queue up again,  unless 
you  were able to get your pre-registrations back to  them  0.0065 
nanoseconds after you received the tickets in the post!

So we decided not to bother this time around..

After  all  that,  upon  perusing the September edition  of  Atari 
Explorer  Online,  it turns out that Atari DID have a stand at the 
ECTS,  and  it was showing quite a lot of very new stuff,including 
Primal Rage,  Defender 2000 with some of the proper graphics,  and 
the Jag version of Zero-5!! 

Annoyed? You bet we are!!

CiH - Sept '95..
