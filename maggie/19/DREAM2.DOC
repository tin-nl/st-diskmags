
          DREAM A LITTLE DREAM 2 - IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!!!

At  last,  the long-awaited sequel to the classic movie 'Dream  A 
Little Dream' starring Corey Feldman,  Corey Haim,  Jason Robards 
and Meredith Salenger is finally with us.   It has taken a while, 
nontheless, but was worth the wait.

First  things  first,  the  terrible news is broken  to  us  that 
Coleman  Ettinger (played by Jason Robards in the  original)  has 
passed away ......  but is still around in spirit.  There is also 
no  sign whatsoever of Lainey Diamond (Meredith  Salenger)  which 
sounds a little odd ...  however,  despite the loss of most major 
characters  from the original,  Dream A Little Dream 2 still  has 
turned into a credible movie.

The  story is previewed as follows:  Bobby and Dinger have  moved 
away from Cleveland (home of the original movie) and have arrived 
in the heady world that is L.A.   Dinger works in a shop  selling 
condoms  - and Bobby works in another shop selling  sunglasses  - 
and both look to be doing quite well.

The movie starts rather violently,  featuring a young bearded guy 
(whose  name  I  haven't figured out yet) going  after  a  pretty 
blonde  girl ..  clearly,  she must have something that he  wants 
badly.

The  movie then cuts to Bobby and Dinger,  in the house they  now 
share  with Dinger's cousin,  played by Robyn Lively.   They  are 
talking  at the table ..  with the same kind of jokes as seen  in 
Dream A Little Dream .. and, at work later on that day, a strange 
package arrives from Cleveland ..  addressed to Bobby and Dinger, 
from Coleman!

The package turns out to be a pair of magic sunglasses - when one 
wears  them  he  (or she) has complete  control  over  the  other 
wearer.  This is portrayed by the fact that Bobby (Corey Feldman) 
dances to a song (that he has written, and, believe me, it sounds 
very  good)  called  'I'm Feeling Funky' in  a  Michael  Jackson-
inspired  dance routine ..  just like in his famous scene in  the 
original with Lainey (Meredith Salenger).

A  couple of days before they received the  sunglasses,  however, 
Bobby  and  Dinger started to experience strange dreams  about  a 
woman who says that she will 'teach them how to make love like  a 
man'.   In Bobby's case, he is dreaming about Dinger (Corey Haim) 
being in a cell with another bearded man (who looks as though  he 
is homeless).   The man in the cell appears to have taken on  the 
persona  of  Coleman (in spirit) as Coleman is supposed  to  have 
died some months ago.  Dinger is dreaming about a girl (who looks 
remarkably  similar to one we have seen at the beginning  of  the 
movie).

Some  days after the sunglasses arrived at the house  that  Bobby 
and Dinger share, the girl from their dreams suddenly turns up in 
real life ..  to give Bobby the surprise of his life.   She tells 
him  that  she  used to work with Coleman just  before  he  died.  
Bobby  invites her into the house and tells her about his  dreams 
and (foolishly) about the sunglasses.

The  girl ends up pinching the sunglasses from Bobby's  workplace 
.. after leaving him tied up on his bed!

Dinger's cousin turns up,  laughing at the state that Bobby's in, 
and,  after  untieing him from the bed,  hears the horrible  news 
that the sunglasses have been taken.  Dinger, who had popped into 
his workplace for something he'd forgotten before, meets the girl 
outside and ends up being arrested by the LA police for 'breaking 
into  his own shop'!   The police put Dinger into a  cell,  which 
also contains the homeless man who was seen in an earlier dream.

Bobby and Dinger's cousin go to see Dinger in the cell, whereupon 
they  agree  to  'dream' to get  the  glasses  back.   The  dream 
features  a  preacher  and a hotel,  much the  same  as  what  is 
discovered  by Bobby and Rachel (Dinger's cousin)  shortly  after 
the chase with the young bearded man.

After  a  hilarious chase sequence through the  hotel,  the  film 
comes to a violent end,  with the death of the young man, happily 
with Bobby, Dinger and Rachel disappearing into the sunset....

Overall,  Dream  A  Little Dream 2 is a good  movie,  well  worth 
watching.  Although it is not quite as good as the original (come 
on, which movie sequels are??)

Despite the fact that the Coreys, ie Feldman and Haim, have a low 
standing  now in the eyes of both the American and the  UK  media 
(well, whenever has the UK media NOT had a low standing of them?) 
this is still a movie worth watching.

Felice.
