

        The Atari World Shows - 9th and 10th December 1995..

An opening for this??

The Saturday..
It is cold,  very cold, and it is early on Saturday morning.. I am 
waiting  for Felice,  our Maggie 'co-presenter',  having taken the 
precaution  of a really decent breakfast just a bit  earlier  (not 
because I have cannibalistic urges vis a vis Felice,  just to save 
on paying unfeasible prices for food at the venue..) Felice is  to 
arrive,  and  kindly  drive us both up to the National  Motorcycle 
Museum at Birmingham for the first days Atari related action..  He 
does,  arriving more or less on time,  and pausing briefly to mint 
some spare copies of the Maggie compilation issue (Best of  issues 
1 to 11) we set off..

It is still cold,  but very bright and clear,  as we drive up, and 
little more than an hour later,  we arrive at the show..  Going up 
to  the entrance,  we find a little surprise,  as the new issue of 
Atari World is on sale,  that is, the new NEW issue, surprising us 
with its impudent promptness, as the current issue had limped into 
the shops only a few days ago and several days late..  We go in to 
size up the action, five pounds lighter.. (In cash of course, they 
did not decide to slice bits off us!!)

A  large  room  full of Atari computery and  people  assaults  the 
senses,  so  we quickly settle down to make some sense of it  all, 
fit the individual pieces into the chaotic jigsaw so to speak..

Fitting  us into their chaotic jigsaws are such notables  as  Mike 
'ST-News' Noyce,  Kev 'Taffy' Davies and very slightly later, Leon 
and  Natasha  'Reservoir Gods' O'Reilly who spot us and  close  in 
before  we can do too much about it..  So it comes to pass that we 
are  gathered  in a little group of our own and  much  banter  and 
chit-chat ensues..

In  the  meantime,  we skirt pass the heaving mass of people  that 
surround   the  System  Solutions  stand  and  visit   the   Titan 
Designs/Black  Scorpion  corner  where Neil  Stewart  and  Douglas 
Little  are  once  more showing their  Expose  to  the  travelling 
public..  Nothing  new there as yet..  No signs of the anticipated 
Apex version 3, but they are hopefully bringing a preview of their 
new Jaguar game to the London show tomorrow..  If they are able to 
get  the  eprom sorted out in time..  (Which they do,  but more of 
that a bit later in the review..)

Notable  appearances  include Goodmans PDL,  who are the  only  PD 
library  actively promoting the PD side of their  business..  Some 
bargains,  such  as a registered version of Towers II for a tenner 
are  there..  Also some very cheap 'old' ST software,  those of us 
who  remember paying œ50-odd pounds for TCB Tracker will not  have 
been  pleased  to see it on sale there at œ4.95..  Also  not  that 
surprised  either..  Various  Maggies are prominently  on  display 
which is pleasing to see..

16-32  have quite a large range of 'proper' software,  including a 
lot  of ST boxes at bargain prices,  several CDs of various kinds, 
including  the  Crawly Crypt series,  several PC-type  disks,  and 
better still,  some NEW FALCON GAMES.. The full versions of Gravon 
and  Evolution  Dino Dudes are there..  Also two really new  ones, 
PLATONIX  and  CONFUSION,  both  German originated  puzzlers,  and 
apparently  with  a heavy demo coders influence..  RiCH Davey  did 
purchase these, and hopefully a review of them sometime??

Compo were there, and selling a wide range of things including the 
NeoN demo CD for a useful tenner, which I did pick up to try out.. 
They  were  also demoing the Falcon '040  Afterburner  accelerator 
board,  where  we found out that the Maggie 18 Falcon shell is not 
exactly compatible with it,  not very,  really..  It got as far as 
Tat's intro,  then gently dies and quits back to the desktop..  We 
had a bit more success on a machine made 'spare' by Titan  Designs 
and  co,  as we got a sneak preview of Leons latest Reservoir Gods 
game,  which is a 'Columns' game with knobs on..  Lots and lots of 
knobs on,  in fact,  multiplayer,  millions of options, power-ups, 
and  more!!  (But no full graphics just yet,  the graphics man has 
had a bad chest and was a bit poorly..)

I was looking for a new hard drive,  IE,  a rather larger capacity 
unit  than  the  80 meg 1987-vintage  dinosaur  living  inside  my 
external  casing,  and  found an ideal replacement at the  Upgrade 
Shop..  A  reasonable 400 meg drive for a reasonable sum of  money 
later,  and  my  credit  card has to go into  hospital  once  more 
screaming for a money doctor to come and help it..  (And just when 
it  was starting to get a little bit better too!!) A stroll  round 
also  found  Brad  Koda of Best Computers,  and one  of  our  show 
companions,  a  gentleman who has the misfortune to live next door 
to Alan Johnstone, pointed out that 68882 maths co-processors were 
on sale at a bargain œ20, so it was time for that magic plastic to 
do its thing again..

Atari  World were also there,  with the tall pale figure of Andrew 
Wright  wafting about the show..  People disappeared from time  to 
time  to the seminars being held on a hall slightly away from  the 
show..

Missing  at  this stage were Merlin,  Gasteiner,  and HiSoft,  who 
would  be  seen at the London Show the day after this  one..  Also 
missing was James Mathews of Top Byte Software, who had apparently 
gone  to France for that weekend..  A bit of an advance on Taunton 
it seems, and James is making quite a habit of it??

Inevitably,  we headed for the food and drink sanctuary on the top 
floor  of  the museum..  We halted for a second only to goggle  in 
disbelief  at the prices on offer for the food,  those of us  with 
cast iron principles (and reasonably happy stomachs) went straight 
to the bar for more 'substantial' forms of refreshment which  came 
in  cans  and glasses and things..  The banter got that  bit  more 
silly,  then  Kev 'bad hair' Dempsey turned up as well..  It was a 
relatively  sedate  reddish-purple this time,  in contrast to  the 
frightening blonde afterburn last seen at the Maggie party..  As I 
am  the hungriest person in the group,  Kev Davies did the  decent 
thing, and kindly lent me some of his chips.. Ta mate!!

Leon and Tash had to go shortly afterwards, but that left the rest 
of  us  to  amuse ourselves for the rest of the day..  Kev  and  I 
closely  examined  the System Solutions stand,  gently prodding  a 
Falcon  running the latest version of the MagiC O/S into  crashing 
nastily,  then  trying to walk away casually as if it were nothing 
to do with us.. Some of the more technically advanced kit on their 
stand included a new version of 'Blowup',  a three in one expander 
board for the Falcon that not only boosted the screen resolutions, 
but  also boosted the processor and DSP speeds,  and also provided 
memory  expansion  in  sensible  (2 meg) steps  as  well..  A  not 
unreasonable  œ165-odd  pounds,  but  a pain if you did  not  have 
unlimited  funds to spare..  Also latest versions of their  famous 
cases,  including the worryingly titled 'Rack and Roll' PC cases.. 
MagiCMac,  Soundpool,  and  a hefty CD-ROM mastering kit for about 
œ1200  pounds..  System Solutions had the best-presented stand  at 
either  of the shows,  but you would have liked a lottery  winners 
cheque to clear it out!

Time ambled on, in that effortless way that it likes to do, and so 
it  came to the final seminar of the day,  which was Andrew Wright 
on  the  future direction of Atari World magazine (how  about  'on 
time'??)  Our tired feet were glad of the seating and we sat  back 
to let the hostilities unfurl..

The  seminar did not have the anticipation and knife-edge  tension 
of  the classic confrontation between Vic 'Bruiser'  Lennard,  and 
Trenton  'Kick Me' Webb at Hammersmith last year..  Andrew  Wright 
got  an easier time,  apart from one slightly disgruntled TT owner 
who queried the fact that no-one said if programs were  compatible 
on  his machine or not..  Other things about the future running of 
the  magazine were suggested,  one of which may be an increase  on 
the cover price to keep up the overall quality!! Watch out!!

Before we knew it,  it was time to go,  as the staff of the museum 
were setting up for a Christmas party around our departing bodies, 
and it was once more into an uncertain car park we headed home..

The Sunday..
7.30am.. Phone rings..

Gareth.. "Hi Chris, are you still coming down to the show!?"

Me.. "Yes I am.." (thinks, but I'm still asleep, look I'll see you 
there when I'm READY, ok??)

Enough of that nonsense..

9.00amish,  Bedford Station,  once more, I am unable to resist the 
call  of  the  British Rail (Network Southeast)  breakfast,  as  I 
hastily  consume a breakfast muffin that looks like baby vomit  if 
you  look too closely at the inside of it..  In imminent danger of 
'losing  it',  I put any squeamish thoughts firmly out of my head, 
and  it does not actually taste too bad if you can forget what  it 
looks  like inside,  and so it comes to pass,  that the train does 
its thing, and I am wandering in the area of Tottenham Court Road, 
a bit over an hour later..

The  London half of the show is being held at a place  called  the 
Marlborough  Hotel,   a  BIG  improvement  on  the  Novotel..  The 
Marlborough  is quite a classy gaff in comparison to some  of  the 
shiteholes  in  the Novotel basement that have been  used  in  the 
past..  We  wonder  if  Andrew Wright is a brother  of  the  hotel 
manager, or if Andrew is a secret 'Big Cheese' to whom the manager 
owes a favour..  The improvement in decor has a price (about œ5.00 
again,)  as  the room is quite a bit smaller than some  that  have 
been used in the past.. It is quite a warm and 'comfortable' place 
in fact, more so, when it gets crowded a bit later on..

Of  the  new  arrivals,  we  find Merlin who were  kept  from  the 
Saturday event by ice,  snow, polar bears, etc on the roads.. They 
have various things for sale,  including one new game, ESLA League 
Manager  III,   an  all-formats  (ST-Falcon)  football  management 
strategy  game  which  comes on two disks,  and has  a  reasonable 
helping  of bells and whistles from the German programming  team.. 
One to get Leon to review for a future issue then.. 

Of even more excitement and interest was the news that the  Falcon 
version  of Obsession had been rescued from the graveyard as  they 
had  obtained the copyright to the game..  Due for release in mid-
March were TWO versions of the game..

Obsession Falcon 1.. A 256 colour reworking of the current game..

Obsession  Falcon II..  A wholly new rewrite to include  multiball 
options, extra flippers, and new tables in 256 colours..

The option of new tables for the existing STE version of Obsession 
has  not  been  ruled out either..  They are  canvassing  existing 
owners, so if you want 'em, get writing to Merlin..

Hopefully more, much more on this by the next issue!!

Meanwhile,  we  were  busy  installing the DBA issue 14  onto  the 
Merlin  Falcon  and discovered the reason why it should  never  go 
onto  the  root  directory of the hard drive..  When  running  the 
'install'  program  it  tries to incorporate  ALL  the  files  and 
folders  on there,  leading to a truly weird main menu which  does 
not work too well.. 

Chastened, we started again..

Just  across the narrow passage,  something new and Jaguar related 
exploded  into a fine shower of pixel dust..  Yes,  it was the new 
Back Scorpion/Titan Designs game..  A shootemup to be sure,  but a 
shootemup  with  an overhead viewpoint,  and lot of subtle  3D-ish 
multilayer  parallax  scrolling..  All  the graphics  were  nicely 
drawn,  even  in this preview level,  and the game moved swiftly.. 
This required a little bit more thought than usual,  as it was the 
sort  of game where the bad guys hid in tricky dark  corners,  and 
tended  to leap out from behind at you..  A little bit  repetitive 
perhaps  at this stage,  but Neil Stewart said that there was more 
to  come..  Anyway,  it is nicely balanced in playability terms at 
the moment..

The  future of this game is a little bit uncertain,  as Titan  are 
effectively  doing  this on their own..  An  independent  release, 
rather  than through the 'good' offices of Atari is  most  likely, 
but who is going to do it, we don't know as yet..

Also new at the show were HiSoft, somewhere in the far corner, and 
Gasteiner who were doing cheap bits and pieces as well..

On  the visitors front,  complementing myself and Felice were  new 
arrivals  RiCH  Davey  and John (VoGue of Skynet)..  RiCH  was  in 
wallet-busting mood as he added several new games, and a CD-ROM to 
his  collection,  the latter after spending a long time waiting to 
get  it  from a very busy System Solutions stand..  John was in  a 
'Del Trotter' frame of mind, SELLING black market copies of Skynet 
Times issue 7 for a quid a go..  (Reviewed in Atari World issue 9, 
with  particular mention given to the Maggie Party  realtime  text 
contained therein - get it now!!) Amazingly, people took him up on 
the  offer as the ill-gotten cash jangled in his pocket in  but  a 
little time!!

The  early morning caller discussed earlier arrived shortly  after 
2.00pm,  a Gareth joined our little band,  and shortly after then, 
we  encountered a mad-eyed metal freak type person  called  Tronic 
(the  OTHER  John  in  our group!) Soon  to  be  editor  of  Power 
Diskmag, along with another companion, Wizard of Effect..

Not  a  lot more to add really,  we did go down to another of  the 
seminars  headed by Andrew Wright,  which went along the lines  of 
'Hardware  for your ST',  briefly summarised as Hard Drives,  good 
idea,  colour printers,  brilliant idea,  CD-ROMs, best for Falcon 
people,  and frequently disturbed by people who took an a la carte 
view  of  the  proceedings,  and  entered and left  noisily  in  a 
constant flow through the swinging doors to the room..

Some  Atari VCS consoles that were not sold at the last  Christmas 
show  for  œ10 back then,  were on sale for an even  more  bargain 
fiver..  Although  I  managed several goes on the  Black  Scorpion 
preview Jag game, I was unable to get anywhere close to the simple 
but wickedly fast shootemup running on the VCS with all the  small 
children that got underfoot..

A little while before the end of the show, I took my farewells and 
some Burger King, and lots of fog later, I got home..

In conclusion..
Good  show,  good  show..  An  established formula providing  some 
novelty,  although this was not quite as strongly emphasised as at 
some  of the previous shows..  There were several new releases  on 
both the gaming and serious sides,  with a bias towards the Falcon 
once more, and a promise of more to come.. Bargains were much more 
strongly present with keen prices for hardware and software..

The  people  were blummin' brilliant (as always),  many  of  these 
faces  are old and familiar,  and many of the visitors turned both 
days  into  a  mini-reunion of the Maggie 5th  Birthday  Party  in 
places,  with  all  but one of the hardcore attendees  turning  up 
(along  with several other people I invited but could not  come).. 
Best  of all,  there were no long-faced Amiga owners bringing  the 
scene down!!

Of final note, we got talking to Andrew Wright, and suggested that 
some demo/scene coverage in a future issue(s) of Atari World might 
be  a  nice thing we could do for them,  and he did not strike  us 
down on the spot for our impudence..  Wait and see in the new year 
there!!
