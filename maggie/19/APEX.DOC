
                      APEX V3.0 - PRESS RELEASE
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hot on the heels of the  phneumonal  success  of APEX Media v2.0 comes
the new APEX - version 3.

APEX v3 is both a  logical  progression  of the program's capabilities
and  an  exploration  of  new   techniques  for  generating  bitmapped
graphics. Using feedback from its many users and our own unique ideas,
APEX v3 will rise  even  further  above  the  competition  in terms of
speed, power, ease of use and quality of design.

A list of the  exciting  new  features  will  be  available nearer the
release date and we are  confident  that  APEX  v3 will have a greater
impact on the Atari graphics market than the original Apex.

Provisionally we expect the pricing of  the full package to be #149.00
(in UK pounds sterling and including VAT and carriage within the UK).

Upgrade fees are as follows;

Intro     #99.00
V2.0     #49.00
V2.13     #39.00

*CiH Note!* - Not a  lot  of  further  information at the present time
about this, but we  understand  that  additional support for animation
and even a sound studio are being looked at, among other things - sure
to be well worth getting when  it  arrives, more detailed info for the
next issue..
