
                    INCUBATOR - THE FALCON-GAME


It all began a short time before the Fried-Bits-II, when we thought of
making a game for the ATARI (first for the ST, then changed to the new
wonderful FALCON). For  the  name  we  choosed  BOOM  (you  can surely
imagine why, can't you ?). After a short  period  of planning we began
to code and paint for it;  it  should  be  fast (even on VGA) and very
colorful (truecolor). Half a  year   later   (around   proTOS  '94) we
released the first preview of the game. But the programs were not good
enough (we thought so) and we began  to code everything a second time.
The new routs are now a lot better than the old ones.

Scrolling mainpart
==================
This part runs in 320*240 pixels resolution in FALCON-TRUE-COLOR at 25
frames per second on  VGA-  and  RGB-monitors.  There  will be over 30
sprites simultanously on screen. Different  weapons (like plasma-shot,
triple-gun, flame-thrower, laser, rockets)  will  be available with at
least 3 power-levels for every weapon.

The  sound-system  is  based   on   a   DSP-rout   written  by  Roland
Spatzenegger. It works at a frequency  of  33  kHz  with  four  music-
channels and four channels for sound-fx. The balance of every voice is
free setable.

DSP-dungeon
===========
The DSP-dungeon also works in TRUE-COLOR-mode. We use NO double pixels
for displaying the  GFX.  Using   all   hardware-capabilties,  we were
able to achieve an average display-rate  of 12-15 frames per second at
a resolution  of  200*126  pixels.  For  orientation  we  included  on
overlayed map like AVP  on  the  JAG.  There  will  be  at least three
different weapons for the player and a minimum of 5 different enemies.

The  whole mapsize  is  about  128*128  walls  big.  Every  texture is
128*128 pixels and the sprites are  about  96*96 pixels. The walls can
be set in any direction (no 90 degree-walls like some other games) and
the sound-system consists of four channels for stereo sound fx.

Amounts of GFX, MUSIC
=====================
Overall, there are more than 40 different enemies in the game. The
scolling-part is divided into 4 levels (jungle, underwater, technic,
alien). Every Level has its  own  big  end-enemy. In addition to that,
there are 4 DSP-dungeons to be played  and  one very secret game-part.
A lot of different wall textures is used to build the dungeons.

For setup the game,  there  is  a  big  fantastic  main-menu. A lot of
raytraced animations are included and  for  your  ears  we have over 6
well-composed pieces of music  from  a  great   musician   and over 20
different samples. You  can  control  the  game  optional  by  digital
joystick, keyboard or  JAG-PAD.  The  system  requirements  will  be a
standard FALCON030 (speeder cards are  normally  no  problem,  but  no
Graphic-cards  !),  4  MB  of  ST-RAM  (additional TT-RAM will be used
by the  programs  to  speed up the game) and about 10-20 MB of free on
harddisk.

We hope to release the game in the first half of 1996 and we even hope
that we can sell enough   games   to   think  of  making  another game
for the FALCON.

That's all for now - I hope  you liked these few informations and find
them interesting enough to tell  any  ATARI-Falcon-user you know about
our forthcoming game.
