Very late last night, Felice  received  a (non?)threatening phone call
from Andrew Wright, the  Brummie-sounding  editor  of Atari World.. He
kindly let us have  several  items  of  pro-Atari  World propaganda in
exchange for not pummelling us to  bits..  The Subscription bit may be
particularly useful for overseas  readers  and  certain Dutch diskzine
editors who cannot otherwise  get  this  fine  mag..  The  rest of it,
concerning Kev Beardsworth etc is fairly self-explanatory..

 CiH - Feb 8th 1996..



                  ATARI WORLD SUBSCRIPTIONS OFFER ......

The whole of the entire Maggie Team support the UK mag, Atari World,
and it's contributors (some of whom are joining from Maggie) so we
thought you'd like to take a look at this PR release, which contains
details about subscribing to the hottest Atari mag for a long long
time.  Atari World supported us by featuring excellent reviews of
Maggie 18, Double Bobble and Tautology 2 (and 1!) over the last few
months or so.  For those of you who are not resident in the UK, this
file gives you the chance to see this amazing mag for yourself (after
you have read Maggie, that is!!!!!)

(ATM, on release of this issue, Issue 10 of AW had just been released,
get your subs in early now!!

The basic truth - Subscriptions add up!

Every month we  produce  the  bigest  Atari  specific  magazine in the
world. Every month thousands of people receive it by Mail because they
subscribe. They are our most valued customers.

With issue 8 of Atari World every  subscriber got a special bonus disk
with their magazine - a free  copy  of  the top selling HiSoft Basic 2
compiler. This came irrespective of if  they subscribe with or without
disk each month. In the years to  come  we expect to have more special
subscriber bonuses.

If you don't subscribe  yet  don't  worry  -  you  can  still get this
special bonus. New subscribers who start  either from issue 9 or issue
10 will also get a free copy of our HiSoft Basic 2 disk.

So, what have you got to lose?   Whether you subscribe with or without
disk then you save in more  ways  than one.  No more scrabbling around
in the newsagent trying to  find  Atari  World amongst the Amiga games
magazines for a start!  What's more subscriptions are cheaper.  If you
subscribed from issue 1  with  disk  you  would  have saved nearly œ18
compared with buying the disks and magazines separately.

Oh, and if you're not sure how long you plan to own your Atari then do
not worry; at any time  you  can  cancel  your  subscription and get a
refund for the outstanding  issues.   Subscribe  and take advantage of
our Basic tutorials, subscribe and start saving now!

Announcement
Staff writer appointed

We've just appointed a new staff  writer  to  the team. From this week
onwards Kevin Beardsworth  (kbeardsworth@cix)  will  be  working  as a
full-time staff writer on Atari World. many of you will know of him as
a founder member of the Falcon Fact File thingy.

I'd like to publicly welcome him to his new post and wish him luck. Of
course he's got two wonderful colleagues in  Neal and I who are always
easy to get on with, never rude and always pay up on time. Should be a
doddle.

We do hope that this will  overcome  the  problems of late arrival but
don't hold your breath.

My advice is to consider  the  publication  date  of  Atari World as a
random event that can be assumed to  take  place before the end of the
month preceding the cover date.  Some  months you'll get it before the
newsagents and others you won't. Whatever, as a subscriber, you'll get
the warm glow that comes  from  the  knowledge that you've helped your
Atari magazine stay alive and kicking.  Even if the editor does repeat
himself on occasion.

Regards
Andrew (editor, Atari World)

Comments from me:

"FFF thingy" ?  Bloody cheek!  Then again,  he calls my group the AAUG
thingy, so I think it's one of those backhanded compliments <g>

Did Kev have a gun to his  head?  Voluntarily working for Neal is like
taking his life into his own hands... <g>

Congrats to Kev and welcome aboard!
