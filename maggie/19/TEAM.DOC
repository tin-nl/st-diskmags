                      A GAME BY IMPACT SOFTWARE



"The ref woz blind! We woz  robbed!  We  wuz all over them! There goal
was a fluke! And offside! And handball! Its all the linesman's fault!"

Ah, the eternal lament of the football  fan, every ready with a string
of excuses to cover up  a  disastrous  performance. And as a Sheffield
Wednesday fan, I have more  than  my  fair  share of excuses. But when
your team clicks, the passes flow, the  goals  hit the back of the net
there can be few things  better.  Pele  called it "the beautiful game"
and it  is  an  obsession  amongst  most  of  the  male  part  of  the
population. Naturally soccer games are  amongst  the most popular game
genres - stick a football related picture on the box and you are bound
to shift units. Unfortunately, most soccer  games aren't that much kop
(sic), and the Waddle-like  genius  pieces  of  soccer software can be
counted on the fingers of one hand.

We have a new contender for the  premiership title of best footy game.
Enter Ralph "Kevin Keegan"  Lovesy,  his  perm  long  consigned to the
annals of history, and his team, "Team". And to further the analogy it
is the Newcastle United of footballing  game  - fast, flowing and full
of beautiful touches, and although  it  may  have some dodgy points at
the back, it is still at the top of the league.

Team is a game for the STE  and  Falcon,  and the first one to use the
potential of the improved video system. Scrolling the entire screen on
the STFM was a  bit  of  nightmare  (unless  you  were  Nic of TCB and
invented hardware scrolling routines  in  your sleep) and consequently
soccer games were either  slow,  or  used  various  cheats to move the
screen about (like Kick  Off's  amazing  realistic grass-like rasters.
Trust Dino Dini to discvoer Timer B's horticultural potential).

With the STE and Falcon things  are  different - this means the entire
screen can be hardly scrolled,  freeing  up  the rest of the processor
time  for  artificial   intelligence,   ball   control  and  collision
detection. The whole pitch  in  team  is  stored  as  one  big area of
memory, the screen just being  a  virtual  window  on this. This means
that team requires one megabyte to  run  -  but with half meg upgrades
being so cheap, I would  imagine  the  great  proportion of STe owners
have 1024K of memory.

The player sprites  are  quite  small,  but  this  allows  more of the
playing area to be displayed on  screen.  You  can even put the screen
into overscan so the screen area is further increased.

The game is very smooth, running entirely in one vbl. The scrolling is
also very well handled - when players run diagonally or quickly change
direction the scrolling doesn't  jerk  about  but smoothly follows the
player, a neat and polished touch.

The in game sound is limited to  the  refs whistle and some cheers and
gasps from the crowd. I hear  rumours that Ralph smuggled a dictaphone
into Anfield to get this authentic crowd sound (or perhaps I am making
this up). There is no  in-game  music,  this  would  have just been an
unnecessary distraction from the game.

The game as a whole is excellently  presented - from the intro screens
to the main menu to  the  game  itself.  The  menu screens have a nice
graduated fill behind them  (very  impressive  for  16  colours) and a
50khz module plays in  the  background  and  it  sounds excellent. The
replay is coded by Griff of Electronic Images.

You have a variety of option from  the  main menu. You can changed the
control method (keyboard, joystick and Jaguar powerpads are supported)
the time of a match can be altered (but only a maximum of 10 minutes a
half. I would have like an option  to  play a full 2x45 match like the
original Kick Off. What do you mean  I should have better things to do
with my time? I'm a student for gods sake!!!)

You can select the leniency  of  the  referee  (although even the most
lenient referee stops the game for ever  foul, he just doesn't book as
many people). The pitch type and  wind  can also be selected. Overscan
and the internal speaker can be  toggled  (a useful feature for Falcon
owners!)

You can play  a  single  friendly  match,  or  start  a  league or cup
competition. The latter two options  are both highly configurable, you
can choose the teams that enter, the  points  for a win, the number of
times they play each other etc.  This  all  adds  to the appeal of the
game.

You also have the option to customise the team - you can enter all the
players names and change their skin  and hair colour. This edited data
can be saved to disk so  you  don't  need to go through this laborious
process every time you load up!

A set of teams comes with the  game,  but  they are a bit out of date.
The Sheffield Wednesday squad is more similar to the one that beat Man
Utd. 1-0 in the 1991  Rumbelows  cup  than  the present one, and Steve
Hodge manages to be included in both the QPR and Leeds squads. Bizarre
but true. I think Ralph has now  remedied this problem and there is an
updated set of team data available.

Back to the game, and you can't  help  admiring how smooth it is. This
is an STe, not a console, but you would be fooled into thinking custom
hardware is being used to shift everything about.

But how does it play? The  gameplay  is  the bastard offspring of Goal
and sensible soccer. You  have  got  aftertouch  and  you can vary the
power on your shot with  the  fire  button.  The ball doesn't stick to
your foot, but after a bit of practice you can dribble with it. I have
to say that this whole  control  system  is  probably  the best on any
football game EVER! When you first play the game you will find it very
awkward, but the more  you  play,  the  more  skilled you become. This
control system really works well. The only slight gripe I have is that
not every direction  is  used  on  aftertouch,  only  those  within 45
degrees of the original movement  direction.  I  would like to see the
directions 90 degrees from the original direction being used for extra
strength aftertouch. Just a thought (put it in Team 2 Ralph!)

So the control system is an  absolute gem. Passing, tackling, heading,
shooting, it all works brilliantly. Even free-kicks, corners and throw
ins are well designed to fit in with this system.

The computer artificial intelligence  is  also  pretty  good. When you
first play the computer, you will  have  a  lot of trouble beating it.
The computer plays a nice passing  style with backheels and other good
touches. The scale of difficulty  is  set  well  from the might of Man
Utd. to the incompetence of Ipswich,  there  is  a team there to match
everyone's ability.

The ball movement is great -  it bounces off other players, goalposts,
corner flags and the crowd. It seems like a real 3D environment.

Another excellent feature is the fact that you can't run through other
players. Most  other  football  games  don't  do  collision  detection
between players and thus you can  just  run though other players. Team
is much more realistic and you  can  only  get passed people by skill.
You can also obstruct opponents and  do shoulder barges and other Tony
Adams style defensive tricks.

The main problem with the game  comes with your OWN players artificial
intelligence. This may seem like a  contradiction in terms, but let me
explain. You only control one  player  (the  one nearest the ball) and
the movement of all others is governed by an a.i. system. In team this
is VERY simplistic  and  players  will  just  move  to  a set position
depending on which quadrant the  ball  is  in.  They will never attack
free space or run towards the ball  unless you are in control of them.
This is very annoying!

Suppose the ball is passed towards  a player, before this player comes
under your control he will run  towards  his designated place and this
is quite likely to be away  from  the  ball.  So  you pass a ball to a
player and he moves away from it! This effect is compounded in defence
with defenders running away from attackers towards their set positions
- very frustrating.

This annoyance is compounded  by  the  fact  that the computer players
will run between two  of  your  players  causing  the  control to swap
between them. One player will then  return to computer control and run
away from the ball,  you  will  then  control  a  defender  in a worse
position to put in a  tackle  and  the attacker will invariably score.
This means defending is impossible.

This flaw almost ruins the game.  Everyone  I  know who has played the
game has pointed this out, but strangely it hasn't been fixed. If only
players ran TOWARDS the ball,  not  some imaginary fixed position this
would be a problem.

The goalkeepers are also a bit  dodgy. Their positioning on shots from
a diagonal angle is terrible  -  you  can  beat  the goalkeeper on his
inside and still get the ball between keeper and goal. Invariably when
you get in the right position you can score from 95% of opportunities.
Also the keeper will watch  tame  shots  slide  past  him into the net
without making an effort to stop them.

Also the selection of which  player  you  are  given control of is not
always right. When defending you should be given control of the player
nearest the ball who is between  the  defender and the goal. Often you
are given control of defender who may  be  near the ball but is behind
the attacker so can't tackle him. (any  tackle from behind is a foul).
This means it is impossible to stop a goal attempt.

The referees are way too accurate! The  beauty of real referees is the
fact they often make mistakes - in  team there is no margin for error.
Any tackle that touches another  player  is  ruled  a  foul - which is
wrong. You can come in with  the most perfect sliding tackle, whipping
the ball away but have  it  judged  a  foul  as you brought the player
down. As long as you win the ball and the tackle isn't from behind, it
shouldn't be a foul.

If I am sounding pedantic forgive me.  This  is a great game, and with
some minor coding tweaks it could be a fantastic game.

It compares very favourably with  its competition. It annihilates both
Goal and Sensible Soccer. It  is  far  more playable then Sensible and
much more stable than Goal. The  control  system  is  a joy to use and
even with its flaws it  is  still  an amazingly playable and addictive
game, and currently the most played game on my Falcon.

If you like football, you must own this game. In their own words it is
probably the best football game ever!!!!
