        Atari World Christmas Show - Birmingham, 08/12/95

The  first  of  the  Christmas shows  organised  by  Atari  World 
magazine was held at the National Motorcycle Museum,  the  normal 
home  of anything to do with computer shows is the  'All  Formats 
Computer Fair' - which,  incidentally,  are the best attended  in 
all  of  the venues where these shows  are  held.   The  National 
Motorcycle  Museum,  just  over the road from  the  world  famous 
National Exhibition Centre just outside Birmingham,  also  houses 
the UK's best collection of classic motorbikes in the many rooms.

During  the past week the weather had been throwing the  elements 
literally  at us,  so it was with some degree of care that  Chris 
and  I drove up to the National Motorcycle Museum for  the  show.  
In actual fact the roads were not that bad (compared to what they 
had been in recent days).

On entry to the show it was found to be held in a large, spacious 
room,  with a fair amount of companies attending.   After picking 
up  a  subscribers (i.e,  free!) copy of the new issue  of  Atari 
World (only just after a week of receiving the previous issue - a 
record  for the world's leading Atari mag!),  I wandered in  with 
Chris.

Close  to the entrance of the show were  System  Solutions,  with 
their new products on display (Hi Karl!).   The Desktopper, while 
not  one of their most recent products was also on  display  here 
and looked VERY tempting indeed ....  especially when Compo  were 
also selling Mega STE keyboards at a reasonable price as well!
System  Solutions  also had updates available of  their  products 
such  as  HD  Driver and they also had the  first  display  of  a 
writeable CD-ROM drive.  Unfortunately I didn't recall the prices 
of the items, but I can tell you that they were worth it.

Next to System Solutions were Titan Designs,  unfortunately minus 
Apex v3 (which they had hoped to show a demo of) but they  seemed 
to  be  having a whale of a time showing punters  the  impressive 
capabilities  of Apex Media.   Many people seemed to be  enjoying 
Dave  Encill's metamorphosis of them into all kinds of weird  and 
wonderful  shapes  (and sizes),  I think he also sold  some  more 
copies of Apex as well, which will no doubt give him something to 
smile about!

Occupying  the next stand was Brad Koda from the  world's  number 
one in anything related to Atari spares, Best Electronics.  Well, 
it was certainly a Brad Koda who, whilst doing a lot of business, 
remarked  to me that he was feeling knackered.   He had done  the 
Toad  show  over  in the US the weekend before  the  Atari  World 
shows,  plus, after the UK shows he was off to France for another 
one!   In  spite  of  the  fact that he  must  have  been  really 
exhausted  with the travelling,  he certainly wins the award  for 
being able to disguise this!  No-one was sure if he had been to a 
quick 'make-over' a la Compo before the show,  but he looked good 
in  spite  of this.   Brad was also able to  reveal  a  pre-press 
version of Best Electronic's long awaited catalogue ..  which was 
already  over  270 pages long and still needing new  bits  to  be 
added.   This should hopefully be around very soon,  probably  in 
early 1996.

Next  to this was a small part of Compo that was  concerned  with 
the  selling  of  Atari World magazine.   Many  people  took  out 
subscriptions  here,  and also bought copies of back issues  that 
were available there.   Some of the late back issues of ST Review 
were also for sale,  in spite of the fact that these are now over 
a year old they still seem to have ever-lasting quality in them.
The infamous issue 3 (yes,  the one that did NOT contain Page 43) 
was  also  on  sale  here,  along with  some  software  that  was 
supported by Compo themselves, like Calligrapher.

Following  on  from the Atari World stand was  a  company  called 
T.U.S.  Developments or The Upgrade Shop.  They were selling hard 
drives,  RAM,  etc,  for STs and Falcons,  and seemed to be doing 
well.

Across the back of the show room was Compo's main stand,  selling 
games and serious software.   They were also selling ST  hardware 
such  as  the  Mega  STE and  TT  keyboards,  these  looked  very 
interesting and I think they sold a fair number of  them.   Compo 
were  also taking in broken STs for repair and were  showing  off 
some new products they had bought,  most notably  Protext,  their 
new purchase from Arnor, who have gone into liquidation recently.

Opposite Compo were 16/32 PD,  selling a wide range of commercial 
games, budget games and CD-ROMs for the Atari range of computers.  
They  also  had  copies of  the  unreleased  Falcon  games,  like 
Llamazap  and Evolution Dino Dudes,  which seemed to be  changing 
hands for reasonable prices.  Also sharing part of the same table 
was the Calamus User's Group, with a fair amount of visitors.

The  last stand in the corner belonged to Goodmans PDL,  who  had 
brought  most  of their entire catalogue of PD  down  with  them.  
They  also  had some good deals on commercial games  and  various 
bits and pieces of hardware,  such as a Mega 1 ST going for  œ95, 
an ex-demo Jaguar for around œ90, etc.

However,  as at most of the recent computer shows, it was nice to 
see  our  friends and contacts to whom normally we speak  to  via 
email ..  Leon O'Reilly & Tash (Reservoir Gods),  Mike Noyce  (ST 
News  & Maggie contributor),  Kev Davies  (Maggie  artist),  Karl 
Brandt  (System Solutions),  Neal O'nions  (Compo),  Dave  Encill 
(Titan) - and many of the people who make up Atari World magazine 
(notably  Graeme Rutt,  Denesh Bhabuta & Joe  Connor).   Joe  was 
talking  nineteen to the dozen about my sending him the  copy  of 
DBA #14 a week previously;  it looks as though it will get a good 
review  in the next issue of Atari World which will be good  news 
for  DBA!   The surprise appearance of the day was made  by  Dale 
Wright - who was a little pissed at first when he  arrived.   The 
problem was that he had arranged to meet some of the BBS guys who 
he  chats with via modem,  but that he did NOT know what  any  of 
them looked like!

We had a meal at the Motorcycle Museum's restaurant, only to find 
that  drink  could  not  be  purchased  until  Neal  O'nions  had 
commandeered the bar!  Apparently the guy who normally deals with 
that had an attack of the flu, which has claimed more people than 
ever.

As  well  as  the  show,  the Atari World  team  were  holding  3 
seminars,  one based on software,  one on hardware, and the final 
one  for people in general to give their thoughts on Atari  World 
as  a magazine and where it should go from this particular  point 
in time.   At the Birmingham show the members of the Maggie  Team 
and  Reservoir  Gods  visited  the  seminar  about  Atari   World 
magazine.   Along  with other contributors from Atari  World  and 
readers  (including  one particularly vociferous  pony-tailed  TT 
owner  who was complaining about the lack of support for it)  the 
topics  were  largely whether or not Atari World  should  support 
people  who  were  using MagicMac to run Atari  software  on  the 
Macintosh or not.  A lively debate followed, carried off with the 
help of Andrew 'Robert Kilroy-Silk' Wright,  the editor of  Atari 
World, under the watchful eye of Neal O'nions.   The  question of
programming was raised - and  hopefully answered  by  our  CIH - 
with the mentioning of  Leon's  name  to Andrew.   It  was also 
suggested by most members in the  audience that  the  Q&A  pages
in Atari World  should  be  extended,  with questions thrown out 
to the 'knowledgeable community' if we  felt that what was printed 
was, dare we say it, 'wrong'.

Generally,  the seminar was very interesting,  I personally  hope 
they continue....

London

On Sunday 10th December,  the Atari World show shifted to London, 
to  the new venue situated just around the corner from  Tottenham 
Court  Road  tube station,  at a place  called  'The  Marlborough 
Hotel' - certainly a big improvement in terms of decor and  taste 
for any computer show.   Although the actual show was held in one 
of  the hotel's suites,  it was very busy,  with  many  customers 
visitng every stand there during the course of the day.

Many  of the stand-holders who occupied space at  the  Birmingham 
show the day before were at the London show,  with the  exception 
of  Gasteiner,  who  were doing some rather good deals  again  on 
broken STs and spare parts for all Atari machines.  They also had 
hard  drives (unboxed) from œ79,  mice from œ5 (let's  hope  they 
work  this  time!) and various bits and pieces  of  software  for 
sale.  Along with other stands, Gasteiner seemed to be doing well 
- a lot of people were buying the broken STs in large numbers  in 
order to have access to spares for their own machines in case  of 
emergencies.

Hisoft  also had a stand at the show,  selling their software  at 
low prices, including Devpac 3, Diamond Edge/Back and VideoMaster 
ST & Falcon.   We also saw some of our friends and contacts  here 
who were not at the Birmingham show,  this included Gary Simmonds 
(Power,  soon  to be Maggie contributor),  John (Vogue) and  Rich 
Davey (FOG & Skynet Times).   Chris and I also met Colin  Fisher-
McAllum  and Kev Beardsworth from the Falcon Fact File (which  we 
shall  be joining soon).   The surprise appearance made  at  this 
show  was by Steve,  the creator of Mad PD (who you may  remember 
was at the Spotlight show as well).   Unfortunately,  Dale didn't 
make  his  appearance here as he said he might - it  appeared  as 
though he got caught up somewhere.

Being  on  the tired old feet that belonged to Chris  and  myself 
was starting to take its toll,  so much so that Gary,  Graeme & I 
decided to take a breather at the bar,  where we talked generally 
about Atari,  the state of the economy,  etc.   In fact it was an 
interesting conversation, once we had drunk up we made it back to 
the show for a little while longer.

We also attended the 'Hardware' seminar at the London show,  this 
consisted   of  a  chat,   once  again  led  by  Andrew   Wright.  
Discussions  about  different  types  of  printers  led  off  the 
seminar,  which  got on to members of the audience talking  about 
the hardware related problems with their STs and  Falcons.   Some 
people in the audience were present with the usual questions like 
'Can I use my ST's 4MB RAM in conjunction with my Falcon?' etc  - 
but  the  prize  for the hilarious  description  of  STE  related 
problems  went  to a guy who mentioned something  about  a  'deep 
sucking  sound' coming from his machine.   Everyone in  the  room 
literally fell about laughing,  with Rich Davey and Danny Bhabuta 
doubled up!   Those of you who weren't there (yes,  that includes 
you, Del!) missed one hell of a laugh!

Both Atari World shows are the best so far in the series of  new-
style Atari shows.   Personally, I enjoyed them .. it was nice to 
be greeted by and to see our contacts there,  they are what makes 
the magic, alongside the exhibitors of course!
