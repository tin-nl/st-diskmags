
                     AGGRESSIVE PARTY II RESULTS

These are  the  official  results  of  all  the  competitions  for the
Aggression 'Aggressive Party II'  held  over  in  Finland  on the last
weekend in December 1995.. Some things to note:-

The Aggression 'Motion Blur' megademo for  the Falcon was not released
there as originally suggested, it looks  like they are keeping it back
for the Symposium Party at  Hamburg  in  April?? Instead, they entered
the 128KB intro competition, the end result  is a bit short, but very,
very nice indeed!!

The ST(E) won  the  4KB  intro  category  with  'Power  of 8mhz'.. The
'Power' of Atomic Packer seems to have  helped a bit here too! It does
not run very well on the Falcon, and not at all on STFM, so I conclude
it needs an STE, as does the other (4th) prize ST intro 'JimB'..

The Falcon  seems  to  have  done  well  in  both  4KB  and  big  demo
categories, the Dead Hackers  Society  (DHS)  first prize winner being
described as quite unlike any other  demo so far produced.. The nicest
Falcon 4KB intro being 'Life' by Mace/Xtream..

There seem to be some silly pseudonyms  on the PC/Amiga scene, can you
imagine any self-respecting Atari person saying  "Hi, write to me, I'm
Rectum !!" (Well, yes, actually.. - ED)

Some reviews of these  demos  and  intros  next  time in Maggie issue
twenty!! Be there!! - CiH..
