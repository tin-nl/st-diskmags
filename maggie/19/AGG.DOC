                  ---------------------------------


Motion Blair! See the cheshire  cat  like  grin  of  the leader of the
opposition rotated and  distorted  by   the   DSP!  It's an intriguing
idea, but perhaps not the one  Finish   crew  Aggression had when they
started working on their  new  demo.   Entitled   "Motion  Blur" it is
perhaps the most eagerly anticipated demos of recent times.

For now  we  have  to  make  do  with  this  taster,  and  it  doesn't
disappoint.

This dentro gives is an invite  to  the Aggressive party 2 in Finland.
The screen fills with eyes and  starts  to  rotate, and before you can
say "not another term..." the whole  image  begins to blur before your
very eyes. An aggression logo appears  and  a new background fades in,
continuing to rotate  and  blur.  The  logo  rotates  and distorts and
becomes an  "Aggressive  Party  2"  logo.  A  new  background appears,
rotating and blurring. Fantastic coding.

The screen is true colour and  full  overscan. It is double line mode,
but still runs on VGA (just appearing in the top half of the screen).

The second part of the dentro is  just a text displayer which displays
some information about the  party  with  a  nice  one  plane font that
smoothly scrolls up the screen.

In the background some haunting music is playing.

This is dentro and is  only  short,  so  I  think  I  will make this a
reviewtro. In summary - an amazing piece of code that really whets the
appetite for forthcoming Aggression productions
