          Raving Dave's Piece.....


Here is the first part of a wholly irregular column for maggie
Its New, It may be a little MAD at times, and it is very irregular. 
But first a bit about the author.....

My Name is DAVID HODGES and I have owned an ST for about four years.
But I dont like ready made plastic boxes that anyone can go out and buy
I like my computers to be a bit different , 

My main machine at the moment is a mega 4 with 2 internal floppies  and
2 internal hard drives (QUANTUM of course) total capacity 100 meg, 
TOS 1.4, Turbo 16 accelerator and im working on fitting an OVERSCAN
mod at the moment to double all screen resolutions all built in an all
metal case (polished aluminium) .

I collect hardware mods and if anyone out there has any I would be 
interested in putting them in a future issue of maggie.
I am also involved in Science-Fiction and I run a huge database
known as the "REAL HITCH-HIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY" which I take along 
to conventions to amuse fans and raise a lot of money for various
charities (I am going to a convention in KIEV in the UKRAINE in october)
The "GUIDE" is a collection of guide entries written in the style of 
DOUGLAS ADAMS with sampled sound  not just covering the 50 odd subjects 
by DOUGLAS ADAMS but over 1000 written by people all over the world on 
a wide range of topics from Train spotters to Milton Keynes and from 
Alcohol to Snooker. 

The most popular subjects are SEX, DRUGS, ROCK n ROLL, and ALCOHOL
if you wish to write an entry for the guide you can send it to me on 
disk as an ASCII file or send it in on paper if you wish,
All entries are welcome and will be used to raise money for charities
and to give fans a laugh.
 
At each convention I go to, the computer can be interrogated on 
any subject free of charge, from Friday through to the finish on 
Monday morning free of charge, and I auction a complete printout 
of all entries for the charity supported by the convention.

Recently, I was a guest of Leeds University and two weeks later, 
at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in Kensington. 
At these two conventions I raised over œ100 for talking books for 
the blind and other childrens charities. If you want to help, you 
could help with a little data entry for a couple of evenings a 
year (I am a one and a half finger typist) please write to the 
address in the next paragraph.

I also do a few repairs and I am also always after non working STs,
MEGA STs, STACYs, for which I have cash waiting.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HARDWARE MODS, CUSTOM MACHINES 
BUILT TO ORDER, SCIENCE-FICTION, OR WANT TO HELP WITH THE "GUIDE"
OR KNOW ANYBODY WITH A STACY FOR SALE AT A GOOD PRICE PLEASE WRITE TO

Future 'Raving Daves' will disclose more of the 'Guide' and also 
how to build your own hard drive for the ST, and some info on DIY 
RAM upgrades..
