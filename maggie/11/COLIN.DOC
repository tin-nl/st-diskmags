Explain your pseudonyms origins (if you have one)?

_________________________________________________


The reason I chose 'MSi' for my psudonym is that I believe that slowly I am 
losing my grip on reality, and lately I have been having these thoughts about 
throwing darts and bits of rusty metal at really crap proletarains or setting 
fires at their feet and watching them scream.This is most common when I am 
walking down busy streets and stupid bastards are slowing me up.generaly I 
console myself with being uncomonly rude.But anyway Manic Stare describes the 
look on my face as these terrible things spring to mind.
