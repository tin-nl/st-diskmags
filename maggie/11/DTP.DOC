               Desk-Top Publishing Problems and how
               to Avoid them....

Firstly, stay away from sad men wearing grey-patterned   cardigans 
who  tend  to  be Mega-ST(e) owners...  Take the last  Atari  club 
meeting I went to,  the meeting started with me owning a brand new 
Falcon  and  showing off it's extended colour and  sound,  morally 
corrupting  the local twelve year old population in the  process.. 
(This  is impossible NOT to do if you are displaying GIF  pictures 
which dwell on only one subject..)

As  the  club was not operating in it's usual place but  inside  a 
small  heated cupboard with a snooker table,  thirst took over.  A 
quick  visit to the bar later found my Falcon transformed  into  a 
Mega-ST with a crowd of these people clustered around it screaming 
"Does  Calamus SL work on it????" "How much memory has  it  got??" 
"Is  this  the model with the hard drive??"..  And too many  other 
brilliant questions to go into more detail... 

Anyway, stay away from these people..

Secondly, why collect stuff for a machine you will never ever use, 
a  lot  of DTP'ers enjoy collecting stuff for the TT,  a  computer 
even thinner on the ground than the Falcon..

Thirdly,  an honest answer to this question please...  Has anybody 
who  owns  a copy of Calamus SL ever put it to any real  use???  I 
know  only  one  person who has,  and he  was  actually  producing 
material in connection with a business, as opposed to printing out 
an example page on a 9-pin printer with a ripped copy of 'SL  then 
shoving  the disks to the back of the box...  The popularity of  a 
DTP  program  seems  to  be related to  the  amount  of  pointless 
tinkering   possible  with  it  by  sad  men  in  grey   patterned 
cardigans...

To avoid becoming a DTP man...  Stay away from patterned cardigans 
and mono monitors,  sell your hard drive if you don't already have 
a use for it...  Take up a really exciting hobby,  like bowling or 
pipe-smoking (On second thoughts, scrap the pipe-smoking, as a lot 
of pointless tinkering is done by men with these objects..)

Just  run  if anybody starts talking about IMG files..  (They  get 
worked  up  and don't usually stop for eight  hours...  The  other 
strange  thing  is  that  they  talk  THROUGH  you,  ignoring  you 
completely, whilst rambling on their chosen subject..)

Anyway, this is the end of this short article for a tricky topic..
