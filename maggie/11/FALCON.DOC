€                         The Atari Falcon

     On August 21st 1992 ,the Atari Falcon is going to be shown for 
the  very  first time to buyers.   This machine is a  mean  beast 
capable  of  many  things  and if all  the  rumours  are  correct 
programmers, users, demo crews can expect to see some good things 
appearing for it soon.   So on a basic tone here are a few things 
about it.  It has :-

          32-bit Motorola 68030 ,   } These 2 processors run
          24-bit Motorola DSP56001 ,} in parallel with each other.

          1.44Mb HD Disk Drive,
          4Mb Smart Card Feature,

          Atari Jaguar Technology,
          Multi-Tasking with ease,                

          32-bit Graphics Display and chips,
          10-channel Stereo DMA Sound,

          Hardware scrolling in ALL directions,
          Maybe a Barrel-Shifting Blitter Chip,
          
          TOS 3 (maybe),
          All TT Resolutions,
          A very low sale price (especially for the chips),

          2 Independent Audio Processors,
          
          Special Graphics functions,

          Adaptions for CD-ROMS already built in,

                    The list is endless.

     Firstly onto the Processors.  The 32-bit M68030 will run in
parallel with the MDSP56001.  Both will run together with the DSP56001
handling nearly all calculations while the M68030 handles the output.
But, that's slightly strange isn't it ?  All outputs now have independent
processors.  One for sound , one for graphics.  So what does this 
DSP56001 actually do ?   

     It's simple , the DSP56001 stands for Digital Signal Processor and
this moves at a whacking rate of 27Mhz and internally at 13.5MIPs,
( Million Instructions Per second ), providing you with fast calculations
all the time.  So you can let the DSP56001 work on some heavy job , say
a fractal landscape, while the M68030 handled the plane, 3D, setting up
the sound and graphics.  Of course the MDSP56001 also handles the new
32-bit graphics as that needs sheer processing power to manipulate it.

     Not only that, but to stop confusion the DSP56001 has it's OWN
internal command set, just like the M68030.  This set contains 
instructions for parallel processing and massive number manipulation.
€
     Next on the list is Graphics.  The Falcon implements 32-bit graphics
which basically means a LOT of COLOUR.  Millions of colours to be precise
so the DSP56001 controls the maths involved with colouring.  Basically,
32-bit means :

     ANY PIXEL ON SCREEN CAN BE ANY COLOUR!  NO PALETTE LIMITATIONS!

     And with the TT resolutions and the Falcons new resolutions games,
demos, art packages are going to be taken to a new high.  Imagine Chaos
Inc. of Delta Force making a Falcon version of NEOChrome Master ?? Or a
Falcon version of Punish your Machine (complete with 10-Channel sound).
     
     The 1.44Mb High Density Disk Drive will also cause a few stirrs,
with this the demo crews could even start releasing 2 HD Disk Demos. That
on a normal ST would span 4 Disks ! 

     The 4Mb Smart Cards are cards that enable you to store information
on a set of chips contained on the card.  They are the size of credit 
cards and can be plugged in and removed excactly like a cartridge.  No
details on price as yet.

     Of course, this wouldn't have been done if Atari hadn't commissioned
the Jaguar.  As technology and hardware from the Jaguar have been used.
The Jaguar incidentally is still going to be released.

     Multi-Tasking will be available on GEM allowing you to switch tasks,
set prioritys etc.  This will blow the lid, hopefully, off that PC 
multi-tasking environment Windows 3.1.

     Hardware Scrolling is also implemented with ease and together with
the Blitter, mass sprites and landscapes will be made with ease and best
of all the 32-bit graphics means nice sprites.  Unless the programmers
a lazy programmer and the artists are crap.

     The blitter ... Controversial issue this !  When the STE was 
released NCE released a smear campaign against it getting programmers 
to say that they thought the blitter was crap because it didn't do 
Barrel-shifting.  Let me say one thing.  Barrel shifting is basically
easy to do in software.  Atari may have give in to NCE (and others) and
they might have placed a Barrel-Shifting Blitter in.  I would be nice if
they have but if it didn't ... who cares ???

     TOS version 3 maybe in but again this is only a rumour.

     The TT resolutions as well as Falcon resolutions looks like that
might stay.  If it does serious DTP is taken to a new high on a Mono
1000+ pixels by 900+ pixels.  But there's more ! The falcon has a total
of 30 SCREEN MODES !  Imagine trying to access that from destktop's
Set Preferences ! No news as yet on the resolutions.

     The Price ??? Only, according to Atari, œ550.

     I think everybody in the worlds going to buy this baby.  Its
€     feature blow everything else off the planet (and I'm a dedicated
     PC Owner!) This machine WILL put the lid on the Amiga Coffin and
     for the price it beats everything just on specs for œ's .

     Its rivals are the Commodore Amiga A800 (boo hiss!),
                        IBM 486DX PC with SVGA (of course),
                        SUN SPARC Workstations ( who have DSP56001 chips).

                         The Amiga is going to cost the same as the 
                         Falcon.  But Comodore has to attempt a rival.

                         The other 2 computers cost a LOT !  I spent
                         œ1000 on a 386DX with Hard Disk etc and VGA
                         , I only wish the Falcon was released.

     Of course it has all singing, all dancing graphics and sound chips,
     to do fabby things such as scaling etc but thats a wait and see
     until the machines released on August 21st 1992.

     Not only that but companies have been working on hardware and
     software for the Falcon and a CD-ROM drive is ready as is numerous
     graphics packages for 32-bit, People are updating their software
     to run with the machines.  And all programs use the DSP56001 for
     data processing providing no slow-downs.

     Memory is expandable to 16Mb and it still has it's MIDI ports.
     It's in the same ST/STE casing except the label is different (of
     course).

     I'm buying one .... I think you should do the same !
