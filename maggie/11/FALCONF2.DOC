Or what is going on maaaannnnn!!!!!

Hannover, end of March and Atari put on the kind of show no longer 
seen in the UK.. There were no details about the consumer machine, 
but  plenty  of new hardware and software  announcements,  also  a 
series  of  new  glossy leaflets  (About  time!!)  describing  the 
machine and it's software in more detail..

The bigger leaflet of the two is about the machine itself,  and is 
the  more bullshitty one,  diving off the lofty metaphor plank  in 
describing  the  Falcon  as "The first  ever  personal  multimedia 
system.."  -  Hhhmmm....  It  does go into some detail  about  the 
hardware  and  there are several screenshots of  working  software 
including Chagall paint, Humans, and Audio Fun machine and D2D..

0f  much  more interest to prospective and actual  owners  is  the 
software  brochure,  with up to eighty entries (And those are only 
the ones we know about..)

Don't hold your breath and try to read to the end of this list..

1. Falcon Speed PC emulator, the subject of a previous list, based 
on  a  16mhz 286 configuration..  A 486SX version is  to  follow.. 
Interestingly,  we  are  told  that  there  is  little  functional 
difference  between the present 286 board and the 386...  A  386SX 
would have SLOWED things down!! OUT EITHER NOW OR REALLY SOON

expansion slot..

Also the following not on the list might be of interest to people..

Jeff  Minter's  game 'Llamazap' is thought to be in the  hands  of 
Atari who may release it as part of a future bundle....

Digital  Data  Deicke  produce a separate  PC-Style  keyboard  and 
standalone case...

GE-Soft  have  already  produced an  expensive  accelerator  board 
including a 32mhz 68030 processor and the ability to support up to 
128MB of memory for approx œ600...  Gasteiner are producing a very 
similar board which also features a VME expansion bus..

16-32  PDL are distributing Lexicor products including  Xenomorph, 
a rendering package which is able to run on all ST's but can  make 
use of the Falcons enhanced graphics modes..

Data  Light  2  giving on the fly  data  compression,  probably  a 
stacker-type  program for general use,  but likely to be used  for 
recording to H/D..

Monitor  adaptors  may be available at last,  at a price of  œ9.99 
each... (Advertised by Ladbroke Computing..)

Marpet memory boards expected soon for the Falcon..

Titan  designs are producing a range of video hardware,  including 
Fresco,  a genlock which allows some very interesting manipulation 
of  3-D objects,  surface texture mapping(!) and morphing(!!)  and 
also  Expose,  a video digitiser capable of grabbing 16-bit images 
and  working  with Fresco....  These will be rather good,  but not 
cheap...

There will be a new network of Atari dealers with Priority  access 
to new Falcon products, there are expected to be up to 50 of these 
in the UK... More on that one as soon as we can..
