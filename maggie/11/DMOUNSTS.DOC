€             "The Demounstures demo" of The TOS-crew

                Reviewed by Corsair of The Giants

Finally  a demo written in Omikron basic again.  The last  one  I 
saw  was the Tea Party demo of the Double Dutch  Crew.  But  this 
one is different.  It is pure Omikron basic.  That means that the 
music is also played by Omikron routines!

Intro:
After  loading the whole disk(!) and unpacking it,  a  text  with 
some  credits appear.  A "TOS"-logo built up of rasters is  boun-
cing over the whole screen and through all borders.

Main menu:
A labyrinth made of (vertical) rasters appears on the screen.  In 
the  middle  of  it stands the  "hero"  called  Smiley.  (A  ball 
containing  a  smile face).  You can move it by using  the  arrow 
keys.  You  can  enter  a  demo  by  moving  Smiley  through  the 
labyrinth,  and  pressing  space on a  stripped-coloured  square. 
Smiley  makes  funny  features  when  crashing  into  a  wall  or 
something.  In the lower part of the screen,  you see a scrolling 
message in medium resolution.
After  choosing  a demo,  it becomes clear that all  screens  are 
stored  in  memory  and  that the  drive  doesn't  have  to  load 
anything! (This is great!)

Circle scroller:
This  is  a  text,  scrolling round a  ball  which  rotates.  The 
font is one plane and rotates 360 degrees.  Beneath the ball  and 
the scroller,  you see a nice fractal landscape. You hear mad max 
music.

S qed screen:
This is a brainblasting screen!  In the left and right border you 
see bouncing raster bars.  The upper and low border are  removed. 
23  Vertical scrollers are moving and distorting over  the  whole 
screen  (xcept  in  the left&right border).  There  is  a  little 
swinging "TOS" logo (1 plane) and a TOS-crew logo (1 plane).  You 
hear a 15 kHz (looped) sample.

The BIG scroller:
Wow,  this  is REALLY a big scroller.  The scroller is as big  as 
your  screen without upper and lower border!  It is bouncing  and 
again you  hear  the looped sample playing.  You must  be  really 
genious if you can beat diz screen (in basic). I was puzzled....

The raster scroller:
Also a great piece of coding.  A large scroller made from rasters 
is  on  the  foreground.  On  the background  are  a  lot  little 
scrollers  (multiscrollers) with "sinus-movements".  It  contains 
mad max music.

Intro screen (with digimusix):
This is the same screen as the intro,  only this time it contains 
the already known looped sample.

Bender scroller:
A  sort of tube/barrel scroller.  Many (very fast) scrollers  are 
moving  round  a  kind of  barrel.  A  (normal)  horizontal  slow 
scroller is also included.  At the background is a one plane TOS-
crew logo. You listen to another musix by Mad max.

Hidden screen (you can find it!):
A  fullscreen!  All  borders  are removed except  for  the  upper 
border.  You  see a TOS-crew logo surrounded with "TV-snow"  (You 
see  that kind of snow when you select an empty  channel  on  the 
TV). The sound is simply some noise.

The monochroom screen:
A  picture  is diplayed of a spacecraft  in  four  greyscales.  A 
"pointerscroller"  (technique  of Mr Ni!) if moving up  and  down 
over the screen. The spacecraft is very well digitized.

My  opinion:  I  think this demo shows you the limits  of  BASIC. 
Many times I thought:  "How the f.ck did they do that?" like  the 
BIG scroller,  S qed screen or their fullscreen.  I can only  say 
that all the basic coders,  but also assembly coders have to take 
a look at this demo. For basic, the code is incredible!

Demo:        Demounstures
Group:       TOS-crew
Made by:     Mr Ni! and Insh_Allah
Code:        9.75
Graphics:    6.5 (Sorry guys)
Music:       7.5
Originality: 6
Overall:     7.5 (But the code is VERY good!!!)
