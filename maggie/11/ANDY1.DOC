Here's the latest missive.

What's  famous?    Whats  successful?    What's  the
yardstick to measure things by?

Some  people would say, that fame can be seen in the
life of a Pop-star, and  that  success  comes  because  that
Pop-star  sells  lots  of  records.  What these people sing,
their    lifestyles,   their  opinions  and  lifestyles  are
patterns which shape, to a greater or lesser  extent,  their
fans.

        An  aquaintance  of  mine knows the wife of the Bass
player in a Band called Simply Red, The band are  as  aboout
as  big as you can get. They are mobbed by fans, pestered by
reporters and constantly  called  upon  for  interviews  and
Photocalls  around the World.  They are, in essence, a cult.
Their Image is sold throughout the World on the basis of the
Albums they sell, their style of music and their 'image'.

        Their  present  Fame  has come from their last album
'Stars'  that  has  been  number  One  in  most   westernisd
countries.   Most  of those sales have been on CD at a price
of around ten pounds depending on the country.  They  are  a
phenomenally  successful  act  because  they  have  sold ten
million copies of this album.  That means 100 million pounds
worth of merchandise shifted.  That also  means  flying  the
wives  and husbands and girlfriends around the World, paying
for  limoisines  and  the  like  and  all  the  other  costs
associated with a World Class act like them.

        For  that, the Band have to give interviews while on
tour, perform concerts and pay for disgustingly  large  and
Plush  luxury  Hotels.   In  short,  there  are  major costs
involved in keeping the band successful and  in  the  Public
Eye,  and  that  those  costs  of  promotion,  because you're
€dealing with a full band, roadies, tech staff and all, is  a
lot and come out of the bands income.

        Recently,  and actually connected though patience is
the virtue to exercise if you wish  to  know  how,  all  the
record shops near me, the ones who stock  Simply Red albums,
have  given  over  large  areas, often amounting to half the
sales area, to console  games.   Simply  Red,  a  flesh  and
synthesiser  Band  are  fighting  a  probable  losing battle
against consoles for retail sales area.

I  couldn't  see why this was happening at first, but
analysis of just a small section of the console market shows
what our normal idea of Fame, The Pop-stars, are up against.
Simply Red sold 10 million albums, but another star  of  the
console   world,   Sonic   the  hedgehog,  sold  33  Million
cartridges.   Those  cartridges  dependant  on  format, cost
around 35 pounds to buy, giving a total  retail  sale  of  1
billion  pounds.  That is 1000 million pounds.  Also, people
are still buying the first Sonic game.  Measured  in  Sales,
that  makes  Sonic  the  Hedgehog ten times more famous than
Simply Red, and with total album sales over  his  career  of
100 million, more successful than everything Michael Jackson
has sung put together. As the profits from a  cartridge sale
is far more than the sale of a  CD,  shops  make  a  lot  of
profits from this.

Recently Sonic 2 came  out,   It  is  forecast  that
sales  will  exceed  those  of  the first games.  As the new
formats are also  more  expensive,  this  will  generate  an
income  of  around  1300 million pounds just by matching the
success of Sonic 1.  That has got to be fiscal success.

Now the disturbing part.   Michael  Jackson,  Simply
Red,   Madonna,   etc  etc,  are  all people who shape their
careers as much as are shaped by the record  companies  they
work  for.  Michael Jackson is not going to really turn Bad,
€Madonna isn't really going to screw everyone  (probably)  and
all   stars  rely on being human to keep in touch with their
audience.  Whatever the aspirational images in their  Music,
it    must    be    accessible    to   the  fans.   We  have
expectations, and apart from a few death metal fans, we  buy
it  to make us happy and to feel entertained.  Music is well
established  and has its own general rules and  an  audience
with cultural expectations of the songs.

It is my opinion  that  Sonic,  for  perfectly  sane
reasons, is not the role model that I would want Children to
grow  into.   True  at the moment its a character in a game,
but bit by bit, that character is  developing  by  not  only
feeding   the  fears  and  the  aspirations  of  its  target
audience, but also by creating those aspirations, and it  is
achieving this by establishing what is normal, or to be more
accurate,  peer  acceptable behaviour as there is no history
of good inntentions to build on over centuries. ( The  first
video  game  appeared  25  years  ago,  and good games in my
opinion, only ten years ago.)

Because  it is a character, a caricature, a cartoon,
it can and does do anything. It is 'designed' to be  adopted
by  its young and reasonably impressionable target audience.
The first Sonic, very much  like  the  latest,  is  a  cute,
street  wise dude who hangs around looking cool and by force
takes what he wants.  That character is totally  manipulated
by  the  copyright  owners  as no human can be.  In the next
Sonic, he could screw Bambi, burn up New York and  kill  off
all life, and it would be seen as a harmless game.  But even
though  we  all  like to wield an axe with the best of them,
and make aliens suck tarmac whenever we get the  chance,  We
must  consider,  if  those  were  our Kids we were trying to
bring up in a violent world, would we prefer them  listening
to   a  human  singing  of  love,  hope,  charity,  tragedy,
difficulties and inspiration, the things that all songs give
us, and that mirror and help us form  our  opinions  of  the
€world  around  us  (  even heavy metal and Rap,) or actively
guiding a cocky character around a world  to  take  what  it
wants  by  force, and win by beating all others.   This  can
be  seen  in a lot of games, but they are usually obvious in
that the character carries a gun, looks like a thug etc...

Michael Jackson will continue to sing  slushy  songs
with  good  rhythms  over  wierd dancing, but they are songs
about life and generally,  trying  to  make  things  better.
Maybe  he  has  an  influence  because  hes  so  famous? His
influence can only operate within his audiences  experiences
because we expext his songs to be accessible, understandable,
with  parallels  of our own lives.  Sonic doesn't have these
conventions,  the  company  sets  the  limits  and  sets its
behaviour,  and  by  doing  so,   I  think  it  is in a very
powerful position over its target audiences and can and does
affect their idea of what is acceptable social behaviour.

Many  psychologists  make  fortunes  debating  these
points,  and evidence has been published to support and deny
this argument, but recently, work has been published showing
that young people can TELL you how  they  should  act  in  a
moral  situation,  but  when  they are filmed secretly in an
arranged example, they ACT completely differently.

Sonic will generate 2 BILLION pounds in sales by the
end of 1993. That is one character in one game available  on
one  system.  If you had the chance to make the profits on 2
Billion pounds, would your Morals worry you?

Finally, and as an extra point.  If you find this as
difficult  to  swallow  as  the captains log,  Consider what
game the Super NES was launched  with  in  Britain.   Street
Fighter  2,   there  was  a time when Golf was played on one
line of a computer guessig the distance to  the  hole.   Now
the  games   are  photo  realistic  (On the PC) and they get
better every year.  Players say the more ddetail the more it
€feels like  they're  really  there......and  that  makes  them
better golfers...............
