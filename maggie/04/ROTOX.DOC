                        by Oliver Wagner

THE STORY:
     
Robin Rotox was a simple-minded dimwit. One day, he told his pot-
ugly wife,  that he would like to do some  shopping. Reluctantly, 
she agreed.  I can tell you, she was a real battleship of a wife. 
Well, Robin was glad to have escaped for a few hours and promptly 
decided to have a few beers at the local pub. 
Two  hours later,  Robin was still sitting where he  had started, 
with  the difference of having gained several pounds  in  weight; 
all due to his "liquid refreshment".  You see, the human body can 
only hold so much beer,  so sooner or later,  Mr. Rotox had to go 
to the loo. 
"Strange",  he  thought loudly to himself,"what is  that  strange 
smell  doing in here".  But all over sudden while taking  a  leak 
dear old Robin remembers where he is,  so this problem is quickly 
solved.
Feeling slightly uneasy,  he decides to sit down on a small stool 
standing in the corner. "Ahh", he thinks and then it happens. 
A green light appears and he is warped up and up, till he arrives 
in a small, brightly lit room. Robin hears many murmuring voices.

- "klee lipoben asritludem"
- "kwo?  antulmen  iklonz  underlimunt es aweriop int  kilom  nom 
   rement"
- "estemumen es illudem de ternilwen"
.

Well,  as  I  gather,  you aren't fluent speakers of  the  Estnu-
Language, spoken only in rather remote part of the Universe-to be 
more precise, only by the enslaved People of Rement.

What I'll do is just engage the translator >>>>

- "Here, our specimen"
- "What? This meager piece is supposed to save our people"
- "Difficult is, try we must"
- "He is the first specimen from planet Earth that we have  seen. 
   We must try him anyway.  If anyone can save us, it's him. None 
   of the others did the job."
- "But not like this, he's too weak. We must give him armor, gun, 
   life-support  system and a central computer to watch  over  it 
   all."

Well,  that seems all very well,  but what for?  The same is poor 
Robin  asking,  who doesn't at all feel well,  in fact only  half 
human.  If you connect the last two words with a hyphen,  this is 
exactly what he has become:  half man, half machine (and no, this 
is definitely not Robo-Cop). 
Robin has been given the task of freeing the World of the Rements 
from the evil invaders of Eltern.  By doing so,  he will help the 
Rements and himself....


THE GAME: 

ROTOX  has ten levels with a varying degree of  difficulty  (some 
are more, some are less difficult, though in general, they become 
more complex).
Each level consists of eight big platforms,  arranged in  circle-
fashion around the central platform.  Once you clear the starting 
platform in the middle,  little paths,  turning planks or  moving 
little platforms start appearing,  enabling you to continue  onto 
another  platform.  Once you have cleared all nine  platforms  of 
foes, your robot will be whisked upwards to the next level. 


THE ROBOT (your character):

Robin comes armed with a gun (being not in his hand,  but in  his 
right arm). With this gun alone, one should be able to cope quite 
well.  For  those  wishing to continue through the  levels  at  a 
quicker rate there are some special objects (one/two or three  in 
each level) to be collected,  which give you one of the following 
upgrades:

1. Backpack Booster 
2. Bazooka on your right shoulder with greater firepower
3. Homing Missiles on your left shoulder 
4. Fragmentation Grenades on your chest 
5. Return of your depleted Energy

Once  you  fall of a platform into  deep  space,  these  upgrades 
disappear (except #5)
You die, once all your energy has been used up, through impacting 
with either projectiles or an enemy.
If Robin wants to turn,  not he turns,  but the platforms.  He is 
thus always facing north (thus the name)




THE FOES:

To  continue into the next level,  you will have to clear all  of 
the platforms off enemies.  Some are stationary, some are moving, 
some  divide upon hitting them,  some take multiple  hitting  and 
some produce ever more enemies, but almost all shoot at you.
Here follows a list of enemies, as far as I can remember them.

1. Stationary Stations: the standard foe, they shoot at you.
2. Spiders:  take multiple  hitting,  don't shoot, but try to hit 
   you in kamikaze attacks.
3. Robots: they shoot and take a lot of hits.
4. Cars:  they divide when  hit,  making two enemies out of  one, 
   these parts flying around divide again,  when hit making  four    
   enemies out of one all in all.
5. Helicopters: usually take several hits, they shoot.
6. Segment Snake:  consists  of about ten segments.  Each segment 
   takes only one hit,  doesn't shoot, but tries to hit you: each 
   segment counts as one foe hitting you=a lot of damage.
7. Scorpions: multiple hits, they shoot.
8. The Eye: takes ages to destroy, the tears damage you.
9. The Balrogs: monsters which take one or two shots, they shoot.
10.A Giant Fly:  multiple hits, quite easy, but damages you a lot 
   if it hits you.
11.Stars: again, they multiply when hit

THE GRAPHIX/SOUND:

The platforms consist of 2-D plates, arranged in different order. 
Each  level  has  got  a  different  theme.  Sometimes  its  just 
platforms,  without any sense,  but sometimes you have  platforms 
representing a garden, then different cars, then animals etc. 
The Graphix are simple,  with nice sprites.  Sometimes,  when you 
turn, there are bad distortions in the 2-D shapes.
The Sound consists only of explosions and shots,  there U.S. Gold 
could have done a better job, as with the graphix.

OVERALL:         77%   That doesn't seem to good, but look at the 
                       Classics Status and  Addictiveness.  Crack 
                       is nothing against this shit.

P.S.  I  hope you realize what kind of work I have put into  this 
article. 
I had all but finished it,  when I realized,  that I was  already 
late  for  a date.  In my panic,  I switched  off  the  computer, 
without saving the document...............fuck, Fuck, FUCK!!!!!!!
