                              Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     Here it is,  a new version of the great Automation Packer. 2 
issues  back we gave you issue 2.3r,  here's the updated  version 
which is not quite the latest, but still very very good ! In this 
article  I will tell you about the new features and some  of  the 
future improvements which you can expect on the Packers' scene.  

     On  version  2.51 are only two major  improvements  which  I 
could find out by simply looking at it.  One of these two  things 
is the new shell which gives the packer a touch of a professional 
look.  The  shell  still  runs in  medium  and  high  resolution. 
Everything  is now mouse controlled.  I do not think that it  can 
still be controlled via the keybaord,  but it might be that  they 
have still left the keybaord functions in the program.

     The  other  new  feature that has been added  is  the  chunk 
packer,  there again I am not quite sure what it does but I  have 
been  told  that it takes large files and divides  them  up  into 
smaller  blocks and then packs them.  This apparently  makes  the 
files smaller.  The source code for the chunk packer is  included 
on the disc (for DevPac 2.0 amd higher).  

     That's all for the improvements, apart from that the packing 
routines  are  improved,  the  depacking  speed  and  the  actual 
percentage of packing. 

     There  is  nothing  much else to say  about  the  Automation 
Packer.

               PACKERS TO LOOK OUT FOR

     I was told by a member of the Subhumans in Turkey,  the guys 
who coded the new version of the packer,  that they were thinking 
of combining the ice packer together with the automation  packer. 
This  is just a rumour that I heard floating about,  in this  new 
mega product they want to use the automation shell along with the 
best of the ice packer,  the packing routines. Now, if they would 
do  this,  they  sure would produce an  extremely  good  product, 
probably the best packer every in history. 

     If anybody out there has written his own packer or converted 
it from the Amiga, please send it to us so that we can feature it 
in one of our future issues of Maggie.

                    Thanks a lot dudes,

                                   Yours Michael Schuessler
