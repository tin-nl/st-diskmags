I think this is what they call a bonus article,  which has cropped 
up  as  one of the gungy by-products of  my  Sellafield-like  mind 
(Enough bullshit, get on with it! - ED)

Firstly, some games, in no order of preference....

MIDWINTER - A stupendous graphical and gaming masterpiece (IF  you 
played it properly and didn't rush off to blow up General  Masters 
H.Q. and winning in three easy moves!!!!)

RAINBOW  ISLANDS - The best licence of 1990,  a very rare playable 
platform  game,  and entirely possible to revive those old stories 
about 'computer junkies' on the basis of this game....
(Did anyone ever finish it or get a cheatmode for it???)

F19  STEALTH FIGHTER - In my opinion,  the best flight-sim of 1990 
(I know there are differences on this,  but I liked it better than 
F29 anyway...)

TURRICAN  -  Best shoot-em-up of 1990,  see review in  Maggie  IV, 
(Again, anybody gotta cheat mode to finish it???)

That  will do for the games for the minute,  some demo screens and 
other proggies that I liked...

LOST  BOYS:-  Funny  how  they  come  to  mind  first???  innit... 
Favourite screens in MINDBOMB DEMO, the 3-D bubble sprites (Wossit 
called  again?)  that  brilliantly impersonate  the  famous  Amiga 
RED-SECTOR demo,  and also the improved-Quartet digi-sound screen. 
My other LOSTBOYS favourite thing is their copy of the  RED-SECTOR 
CES  demo,  combining  ultra fast 3-D solid vector and 3-D  balls, 
which was in fact the intro to issue 2 of MAGGIE.....

Some other crews,  TCB SOWATT DEMO,  favourite screen, their take-
off  of the Amiga TECHTECH demo,  including digisound..  (Whatever 
happened  to  their  new  demo,   due  out  this  year??)  PHALANX 
OVERDRIVE,  and  their  BITMAP-MANIA screen,  currently the best of 
it's kind (Three million scrolltexts...) Also lovely main menu and 
sound  on  the STE DELERIOUS III Demo,  apologies to all  those  I 
haven't  mentioned,  but  there were what seemed like hundreds  of 
good demos released this year, and the above ones mentioned sprang 
to mind first....

1990 was the year of the soundtracker, with hundreds more of these 
things  coming out of the woodwork,  congratulations to  EQUNINOXE 
and ST-CONNEXION and the people who produced NOISETRACKER (EMPIRE, 
I  think?)...  TCB TRACKER (hem hem) being the one to appear as  a 
commercial release... And it has done very well...

Other favourite things include Computer shows that offer value for 
money (very rare..) attractive young females who are right  little 
ravers  (Even  rarer,  going  on  my  experiences  they  must  be 
practically extinct as a species....) and games that are brilliant 
and offer value for money (See item 2, above...)

I forgot to add, for demos, the Replicants, CHROME SCREEN, on the 
'Life's A Bitch' demo, and the soundchip music for the SWEDISH NEW 
YEAR '90 demo, also on 'Life's A Bitch' those 3-D solid vectors 
were back, and faster than ever......

I think that is quite enough burbling for what is clearly a space-
filler  article,  but before I go,  if anyone has got any personal 
favourite  lists for the ST in 1990,  then don't hesitate to write 
to us......
