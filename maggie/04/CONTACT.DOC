* The Wild Boys (Powerman and Flashbak Jack) are currently in need  *
* of some contacts to do some grafix and muzix for our next mega    *
* demo. It will be much better than our first one, so please write  *
* to me or send me some stuff. You will be credited in the demo of  *
* course. You dont have to have done the muzix of grafix yourself,  *
* anything ripped will be used if its good. Even if its ripped from *
* the Amiga! So, for instant fame, write or send some stuff to:     *
*                                                                   *
*      Powerman                                                     *
*      131 Gunnersbury Avenue                                       *
*      Acton                                                        *
*      London                                                       *
*      W3 8LE                                                       *

* PS I really need some fonts and TWB logos and volume indicators!  *
*    I would prefer 1,2 or 3 bitplane colour grafix (thats grafix   *
*    using colours 0-1,colours 0-3 and colours 0-7 respectively)    *
*    but any 4 bitplane (16 colours) grafix will be used if I have  *
*    enough processor time!                                         *
*    If you send me some muzix, please include the replay code.     *
*    Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                *
