
                    THE SYNTAX TERROR DEMO
                    ----------------------

                  programmed by Delta Force


Today,  22.12.1990,  9.50  PM I'm siting in front of this  really 
horrible  looking  ST  and think about how to  start  the  SYNTAX 
TERROR  review.  This is the second day of the ST News  Christmas 
Convention and issue four of MAGGIE is nearly finished!
First of all some words about this issue and this article:
Only about three weeks after MAGGIE 3 has been launched Sammy Joe 
and myself (Timo) decided to bring a joined Christmas  Convention 
Issue  launched by MAGGIE and Disk MAGAZIN!  I have to  tell  you 
that  it  will be the last issue of the Disk  MAGAZIN.  I  myself 
joined  the MAGGIE crew and I hope I'll be able to  increase  the 
quality of this famous disk magazine.

But now let's start talking about the SYNTAX TERROR DEMO:
About  two  years ago three (really mad guys!) decided  to  start 
programming a megademo for the Atari ST!  The four most important 
members  of the Delta Force (member of the UnioN!),  New Mode  as 
maincoder,  Chaos Inc. as second coder, Slime as main painter and 
Questlord  as second painter tried to do this.
After  two years of gambling,  doing nothing than  shhhiittt  and 
also  sometimes coding they present their megademo containing  25 
screens!!!!!!!!!

OK. This is an interrupt by someone who should not be typing here 
and  who generally has nothing to do with "Maggie" or  something. 
It's Cronos from the Amazing Cracking Conspiracy, who may (or may 
not)  be  known to be working for "ST NEWS" (which is  a  bit  of 
competing magazine on disk, I guess).
Well. Since I suppose I am not very welcome to type a lot here, I 
guess I'd better sign off.  I have more to do here (as you  know, 
this   article  is  being  written  at  the  infamous  "ST   NEWS 
INTERNATIONAL CHRISTMAS CODING CONVENTION" which just happens  to 
be the event of the decade (maybe even of the century,  but  I'll 
leave that up to others to say).
Bye.

Hello. This is the Morderous Gnaerhelm from Norway. I just wanted 
to   say  that  the  "ST  NEWS  INTERNATIONAL  CHRISTMAS   CODING 
CONVENTION" is the most major event of the century.
Bye.

Hello. Here's Cronos again. See what I mean?
Thanks Morderous.

                               ***

These are words by Richard the 'Cheesemaker' and I returned to my 
ST when he was writing these few sentences!  Let's return to  the 
Syntax Terror Demo and start with the loader. After inserting the 
disk  and  surviving the loader you crash into  an  average  menu 
which looks a bit as the 'Life is a bitch'-mainmenu!
A  simple coloured scroller,  some stars and a cycle-scroller  to 
choose the different screens built up this menu. Let's choose one 
screen after the other and inform you about what happens:

1. Sum big Shapes:
This is one of these screens which might be difficult to  program 
(caused by the big shapes!  I don't know!!!), but it looks really 
boring.  Next  to  this shapes saying 'The Union'  you  only  see 
another simple rasterscroller (don't give up,  great screens will 
follow!).

2. Soko Ban:
First  time  in history Delta Force managed to bring  a  complete 
game called 'Soko Ban'.  The game also contains a really  colour-
full introducing screen! After this you can choose from 50 levels 
(original  PC level design!) and get the real Soko  Ban  feeling. 
Final very important feature: the highscore will be safed automa-
tically when leaving the screen!! Fantastic idea !!!!!

3. Colourshock III:
This is the third part of the story called:  'How can I create  a 
further screen containing as much colours and HBLs as possible!". 
Well done, but I think we had enough shocks.......

4. Big Border:
You'll understand this title when you see the screen: it contains 
the biggest borders ever programmed on the ST!  In the middle  of 
the screen you find (when looking really close!) a 100*100 pixels 
small  screen (all around nothing else than dark  border!  Really 
difficult  to  program!!!!!).  Within this screen  you  find  the 
smallest scroller (5 pixels!) and the smallest distorter! This is 
the stuff we need .... 

5. Snurkel Twist:
Another part of the story 'how can I program the most  unreadable 
scrolline?'. Sometimes it is very difficult to follow the cycling 
and  waving scroller!  You also get a very big logo  ...  average 
screen .....

6. The Ball-Scroller:
An idea transfered from the Amiga: a scroller depending on bballs 
which  move in various waveforms.  Also some other shit  I  can't 
remember yet! If you wanna know it, just try to get the demo ....

7. Match it!
Game number two is stylled as 'Shanghai' and 'Turn it'!  This  is 
one  of these games you can play for hours and hours.  Also  this 
game contains 50 levels and a highscore which you can safe to the 
disk! Again very well done .......

8. Sukka Screen:
Lots  of  things  are  moving around  within  this  screen  as  a 
backgroundscroller,  little scrolllines, a logo and some sprites. 
'A lot, but nothing special!!!!'.

9. The Lamertest:
Within  this  screen you have to answer 10 out of  128  questions 
under  the topic 'Atari ST'!  According to the number of  correct 
answers  you  get the title 'Lamer' or you get it  not.  A  funny 
idea again coming from the Amiga , but I start wondering  why the 
ST-crews are not able to have these ideas .....

10. BeeCeeDee Two:
Another  really well designed and programmed screen containing  a 
lot  of  action  as several different sized  scrollers  and  some 
distorters!!!! Well done !!!!

11. The official greetings:
A mega-giga idea is brougth to us with this screen!  Here we  get 
all the greetings we can't find in the other  scrollers!  Special 
feature:  the screen contains most of the logos used by the crews 
mentioned in this screen!!! Weeeeeeeelllll ddddddone!!

Now  I  have  to  tell you something  about  the  so  called:'ICC  
Competition Screens':

1. Twentyfourhoursscreen from Nick of TCB:
This   screen   contains  sync  scrolling   (whole   screen),   a 
rasterscroller  and  some  little vector  grafixx.  24  hours  to 
produce  such  a screen?  You must come from Sweden  to  do  this 
...... fantastic ....... !!!!!!

2. Onedayscreen by Ford Perfect (BMT):
Another  screen built within one day!  Only a big scroller and  a 
moving sinus curve!  Simple, but very nice ... well done (only 24 
hours time!).

3. Realtimezoomer by the Gigabyte Crew:
This  is  one  of  these mathematical  but  very  boring  screens 
although they might be very difficult to code.  You see a zooming 
logo and ... and .... hmmm, and some further grafixx!

Now the guest screens:

1. Next:
After  activating  this  screen you see  a  simple  colourcyling-
moving-floor  (just don't know how to explain this!) and  a  lame 
scroller,  but after a few seconds the screen starts 'living' and 
a  zooming logo and a cycling scrolline increase the  quality  of 
this screen.

2. The Respectables:
The Respectables present their second screen and they strike back 
with  a  distorted  logo (only a part of  their  name!),  a  mega 
'Respectables'  swinging  through the screen (just  look  at  the 
interesting shadow!),  a floor-scroller (again this special  type 
of  thing,which  is very difficult to explain) and  a  low-border 
scrollline. Well done Respectables!!!!!!

3. TEX:
It  is  very  difficult to tell you anything  about  this  screen 
because  of the great amount of things which happen!  Some  words 
about this well screen which caused a lot of trouble:
Daryl of TEX had to program this screen and about one day  before 
launching  the SYNTAX TERROR DEMO he found several errors he  had 
to correct. A lot of trouble till the demo could vbe finished !

4. Legacy:
An average screen a great circle-scroller .......
(Just  one word from me,  Fury (the author of  the  screen),  the 
screen's  not as good as it could have been had I had more than  a 
week to make it...)

5. Multicoloursounddisplay by Level 16:
The most colourful equalizer ever programmed on the Atari  ST.  A 
really  fantastically realized screen,  although  theirs  nothing 
more than the colours!!!!!!

Now some words about one of the two Hiddenscreens:
If you want to activate the Hiddenscreen number 1 , just move the 
blinking line over the Delta Force member list, so that you can't 
see  this  cursor  anymore.   Than  you  have  to   enter:"HEMMEL 
HERRGOTTSJESASWILLA".   IMPORTANT:  THIS  IS  NO  JOKE,  BUT  THE 
SENTENCE YOU HAVE TO ENTER,  IF YOU WANNA GET INTO HIDDEN  SCREEN 
NUMBER 1.  All freaks can search the second hidden screen and  if 
you find it send us the way to get in .....

This  is  all we can say about the screens you can  find  in  the 
SYNTAX  TERROR DEMO!  Caused by the fact that I'm very tired  and 
that  I  have to do some further work for MAGGIE 4  I'll  try  to 
write a short last sentence. At the moment the SYNTAX TERROR DEMO 
is  the  best mega demo ever produced on the ST!  Let me  try  to 
explain this:

1. Syntax Terror has got most screens on one disk (25 Screens!)
2. First  time  in demo-history you get two COMPLET games with  a 
demo. 
3.  You  get some really funny and well done screens within  this 
demo.

But  theirs  also a little piece of demostuff I  have  missed:  I 
would  like to have one screen containing  some  digisounds,  al-
though  this  would  have the effect that we  could  not  get  25 
screens on one disk .......
