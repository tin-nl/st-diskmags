         clothes (especially T-Shirts, though I have none)

MUSIC TASTES: I recently started listenning intensively to Heavy Metal
              stuff (I found it as the best way to forget all stress after
              school). I also like stuff like Art Of Noise, and other
              synth muzaks. Over for muzaks.

         Playing RPG (When not coding...)
         Reading Heroic Fantasy books (After coding...)
   
FAVE FOOD: Some stuff I ate last summer in a Greek Restaurant, I just
           don't remember the name as it was in Germany and I couldn't
           understand a word of what these f.....g Germans were calling
           it. (It could very well have been called 'Shit On Vomit' I
           wouldn't have seen the difference before eating...)

             Orange Juice     

FAVE GIRL: Candy Dulfer    

FAVE POSITION: On my bed... 

FAVE COMPUTER: Uh... Well... I guess I have to say the ST, but the TT
	   is what makes me dream (hope that when the dream becomes
	   reality, I won't be disappointed).

FAVE BOOKS: DragonLance, Elric Saga, Lord Of The Rings. Actually, all
	books I've read at least twice, that is, almost all the books
	I have ever read.

	    beating me TNS!) and Us and Sync and ST Connexion and
	    Phalanx and all crew making nice demos... By the way, 
	    this does not include Next... (I told you I would have 
	    my revenge, and, on the other hand, you have never 
	    released a nice screen)

WORST DEMO CREW: No!!! No!!! Please, fingers, stop typing without beeing
	     ordered, arrhhhh..... Ne.... Nes... Nexttttttttttt
	     Arrghhh...
	     No! Just kidding, I won't slag anyone, as everyone has
	     to begin somewhere, but I do only accept this during
	     a little while for if one hasn't improved at all in a
	     year, then, this demo crew is lame.

BEST DEMO: Overdrive and Life's A Bitch (who? Who said it's because I
           participated I'm saying that. It's not because it's true you
           have to tell everyone... Shut Up...)
                  
WORST THOUGHT: Having an accident and not beeing able to move anymore,
	   I'd rather die than beeing some kind of vegetable


	OK, It's now time to fill in the other's member interview.
