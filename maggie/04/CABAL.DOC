For  anyone  who  has  ever  played  or  seen  the  Golden  Oldie, 
"Operation Wolf", then this lastest release from Ocean is going to 
look pretty familiar.  Cabal, like its predecessor, offers you the 
chance to re-enact the climatic moments from all those much  loved 
Rambo  and Schwarzenegger movies.   Your mission,  if  you  should 
choose to accept it,  is to penetrate deep behind enemy lines with 
the  sole  purpose of inflicting as many casualties  as  possible.  
The screen layout resulting from this places your valiant soldier, 
or  should it be suicidal nutter ?,  in the foreground of  hostile 
territory.  He has his back toward you and the cross sights of his 
machine gun mobile upon the enemy horizon.   From here,  and  with 
your assistance,  he must fight for liberty and justice,  or in my 
case basic survival.   Either way this generally entails  shooting 
just about everything thats stupid enough to walk on screen.   Not 
a difficult proposition if only the enemy hadn't been given vastly 
superior  numbers  and therefore fire power.   As if  this  wasn't 
unsporting enough,  they just happen to have tanks as  well.   Add 
this  to later stages that include mad  multi-gunned  helicopters, 
jet  fighters  and hand-grenade lobbing assassins and  it  becomes 
pretty  apparent  that your visit is unwelcome.   Or at  the  very 
least badly timed.  It wasn't long before I began feeling about as
wanted as a porkchop at a Rabbi's picnic.  Still never mind, armed 
with what was proving to be an inexhaustable bullet supply and the 
odd sprinkling of my own hand-grenades life expectancy was looking 
up.   O.K.  so it did take me alittle while to get past the  first 
screen but after I'd achieved this things seemed to settle down.




Certainly  this  game  lacked  neither  playability  or  addictive 
qualities.   And  as far as being a successor to programes of  its 
type it bore up really well.  Having your character represented on 
screen and with movement across the foreground truely added to the 
challenge.   The  joy of bullet dodging and hiding behind the  few 
useful barriers that lay about was all good fun.   Even so it  did 
initially have its draw backs in that your soldier doesn't  follow 
precisely behind his gunsight.  This means that while your blowing 
the legs out from under one terrorist your silly arsed soldier  is 
just  as  likely to be rolling into the path of  some  other  gits 
bullet.   But  as I discovered there is a secret to this  joystick 
control system.   For as long as you keep your finger on the  fire 
button your guy will stand and just spray bullets at what ever you 
place  under the cross-hairs.   Equally,  stop firing totally  and 
you'll  have complete control over your man and  avoiding  bullets 
becomes comparatively easy.  Do not, as I did, fire bursts of ammo 
whilst  moving  intermittently,   under  such  circumstances  your 
soldier throws a fit,  rolling and running about the screen  until 
an enemy shot kindly puts him out of his misery.   Something  that 
tends  not to take very long.   The landscapes in which you  fight 
are  both  varied  and detailed.   Also they are in  a  small  way 
interactive.   This becomes apparent when houses and barriers used 
by the enemy are seen to crumble under your repeated  fire.   Even 
the  bushes  shook  when  I  sprayed a  shower  of  bullets  at  a 
retreating badie,  nice touch that.   The targets themselves  were 
clear  and well animated,  with a variety of movement and  deaths.  
By  the  way,  Quick  Tip,  shoot the guys who come  on  with  the 
stretcher,  it  results  in  loads of extra grenades  for  you  to 
collect.   And  so to the game structure.   In total there are  20 
screens to battle through set into four level of five.   Maths was 
always  my  strong  point.   The last one of  each  level  is  the 
equivalent  to  the Guardian stage in other games  and  proves  in 
every case to be a real bugger.




Any compliants I hear you cry,  or I would be if I was you.   Yes, 
three.   Firstly  throwing  hand-grenades  when  you  want  to  is 
achieved  more  through  luck than  judgement.   I  wouldn't  have  
minded  using  the  space bar as well as the joystick  if  it  had 
helped.   Secondly  why  oh why does my  macho  killer  cellibrate 
winning  each screen by running into the distance like a  demented 
baboon  with the shits?   Funny at first but not very  in  keeping 
with the game.   And lastly, are 20 screens really value for money 
because I think not.



In conclusion,  Cabal is a very good game of its type and if  that 
appeals,  then many happy hours lay in store.   But in truth there 
is nothing really special or very different on offer here.  If you 
do consider buying it I recommend going halves on the cost with  a 
friend,  not  least of all because the two player mode is  just  a 
scream.
