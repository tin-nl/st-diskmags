
                             PREVIEWS

Leon O'Reilly has a look into the future!

In 1991 I predict Commodore will go bakrupt,  Atari will release a 
16Mhz  16.7  million  colour  16  channel  stereo  ST,   Sheffield 
Wednesday will win the FA cup and Abermule will become the capital 
of the universe.
But what games will be released? 
Here are some of those mout watering titles just about to pop  out 
of thos software house's bellies.

ADVANCED DESTROYER SIMULATOR by US GOLD
Percy Thrower is back from the dead!
You have 15 greenhouses to cope with under a variety of  strenuous 
weather conditions.  There are also greenfly to cope with and  the 
notorious dissatisfied customers. Can you cope?
Actually,  I  lied.  ADS is a boat simulator set in the year  1940 
when owning an Amiga was fasionable. You chug about some vast blue 
expanse dodging icebergs,  enememy boats, torpedos, submarines and 
the  Loch Ness monster,  though according to the Sunday Sport  the 
Loch Ness monster is a submarine.

ARMOUR-GEDDEN by PYSGNOSIS
And you thought it was just a Def Leppard song!  From the home  of 
the  Amiga  worshippers comes an  interesting  looking  game.  You 
control six different vehicles in an impressive 3D environment  as 
you have to seek and destroy enemy power lines.  You can also link 
up two computers and play head to head.

BATTLE CHESS 2 : CHINESE CHESS by ELECTRONIC
Stunning  graphics,   humorous  animation,   realistic  sound  and 
improved computer intelligence make this a worthy to successor  to 
everyone's favourite chess game. 
New pieces include cannons,  counsellors and ministers.  There are 
some  funny  animation  sequences  with  rooks  transforming  into 
dragons and frying knights,  councillors change into Timmy  Mallet 
and flatten pawns with huge pink mallets.
BC2 incorporates 2D and 3D views and unlike normal chess there  is 
no chance of you losing any of the pieces.

BATTLE COMMAND by OCEAN
The follow up to Carrier Command, and this time you're in a tank.
You  move  around  a 3D environment in your  'Mauler'  (My  Mauler 
usually moves around in other peoples environments!) and blow  the 
hell out of anything that moves. 
16 varied missions should keep you happy till Carrier Command 3. 

BATTLETECH II : THE CRESCENT HAWK'S REVENGE by ACTIVISION
And you thought all crescent hawks had been killed!
This  game is only available on PC at the moment but I predict  it 
will make its way to ST like Battletech 1 did.
You  are  Jason Donnovan (No I don't think so  somehow)  Ok  then, 
you're Jason Youngblood. 
You  have 20 years to complete 20 scenarios set on five  different 
planets. 

BETRAYAL by MICROPROSE
A  medieval  strategy game,  tou must rise in the  King's  favour, 
increase your fortune and dispose of your opponents.
You controll a number of towns,  in which you can arry out various 
tasks: Sow, harvest or invest. 
Payment  of taxes allows you to access to the court where you  can 
really get your fingers in.  Spy,  assassinate,  wage  war,  raise 
taxes,  negotiate  the choice is yours.  But who will you  end  up 
betraying?

BILLY THE KID by OCEAN
Ocean do their Emilo Estevez impressions.
Early screenshots look dire.
Prepare to be violently sick when it is released!

CHASE HQ II - SPECIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION by OCEAN
A  conversion of the stonking taito coin-op by Taito  specialists, 
Ocean. Race your car about following leads from Nancy.  
You must find the crimal and instead of just giving him a good ram 
up the ass, you can also shoot at him.

CELICA GT RALLY by GREMLIN
At last, a rival to Lombard RAC rally.
This game has been written by Fungus the Bogeyman,  the programmer 
who wrote such excellent demos as Story of a scroll,  Starwars rap 
and Starwars the movie. All great demos fungus! Lets hope you game 
is as good!

CRIME WAVE by US GOLD
This  is  a  powerful detective  drama  that  features  incredible 
digitised  graphics including real actors  and  models!  Realsound 
digitised  sound,  whatever  that is.  You also get  a  unique  3D 
scrolling playing field.  You get tremendous depth and playability 
and  some chap on the cover of the box with a mean  expression  on 
his face.

CRUISE FOR A CORPSE by DELPHINE
What  a jolly sounding title!  This is the third adventure in  the 
Future  wars  series  and if its anywhere  as  good  as  Operation 
Stealth  then  there are going to be some  happy  adventurers  out 
there!

CYBER ASSAULT by ARC
From everone's favourite software house who have made such  great, 
stunning games such as...um....Badlands Pete? 
Well this time ARC may release a game worth playing,  at least its 
and  originalish idea.  Your this chap made up of 3D polygons  and 
you  wander  around a 3D world doing 3D type  of  things,  solving 
puzzles. Apparently you can either run or walk! What a challenge!

DAMOCLES MISSION DISKS by NOVAGEN
You heard the hype, you've seen the adverts, you've goggled at the 
reviews, you've played the game, now play the mission disk. 
This  has  five  (five!!!)  spanking new  missions  and  many  new 
features!  I  just hope we don't have to wait two years  for  this 
one!

DEATHTRAP by ANCO
Anco  used to be made up of a lot of perverts in long  trenchcoats 
who  digitised dirty pictures and called this a game.  Then  along 
came a chap called Dino Dini and showed everyone in the world  how 
a game should be written.
Now Anco are releasing their first game since Kick Off 2.  It is a 
standard looking beat-em-up. It won't be as good as Kick Off 2 but 
it will probably be better than Donna & Sam's strip poker!

DEFENDER II by ARC
The  best programmer that Atari (and he only joined to get a  free 
Lynx) have working for them is about to release a new game.
Defender  II consists of three games,  Defender,  Defender  2  and 
Stargate.  Graphics  look  ho-hum,  sound  is  an  'original  rock 
soundtrack', but as Jeff himself said "Forget about your computers 
soundchip,  turn  the  sound off,  put on Pink Floyd an  pump  the 
volume up!"
This will probably be an extremely playable game,  I just hope its 
as much fun as gridrunner!

DUSTER by IMAGEWORKS
Training to be a housekeeper has always been a risky and difficult 
task.  Help  is  on  the way from Imageworks in  this  first  ever 
cleaning simulation.  Which polish works best on an oak table? How 
can you get rid of all that dust from the books in bookshelf?  How 
do  you successfully clean the chimney?  Which size cloth is  best 
for the sideboard?  If you can answer these question then you will 
be up to the challenge of Duster.
Also  included in this package is a game set in Heaven,  the  39th 
century  agricultural colony that is.  As its near  the  sun,  its 
inhabitants  keep  turning  into mutants,  and  we  ain't  talking 
turtles here.  These mutants eat crops,  and the farmers want this 
stopped. Pest controllers, known as Dusters, are hired to wipe out 
this threat.
In other words this a 3D shoot-em-up where you to killas many bugs 
as possible.

ECO PHANTOMS by ELECTRONIC ZOO
Eco phantoms are little gits that raid planets of all their  vital 
mineral  resources,  then  suck  out the whole  energy  of  planet 
destroying all life completely.  Sound like poll tax collectors to 
me. 
The Eco Phantoms have invaded Earth! Shock horror! They've now set 
up four domes which you have to penetrate (!). Once in these alien 
hellholes you must shut down all the main factories and gather the 
information  disks.  Taking these to you motherfuckership you  can 
restore life to the Earth! And just in time for Christmas too!

EPIC by OCEAN
No,  not  another  Tom Clancy book but Ocean's follow up  to  F-29 
retaliator.
This  is a 3D shoot-em-up which was originally to be the third  in 
the goldrunner series before the Diddy men took the job on.
Expect fast graphics, excellent sound and millions of bugs.

ESWAT by US GOLD
You are a policeman i.e.  you are allowed to beat the shit out  of 
whoever  you want and get away with it.  A traditional  beat-em-up 
with  big sprites,  this one looks very similar to  Dragon  Ninja. 
Lets hope its not that bad (dudes!).

FINAL WHISTLE by ANCO
Everyone's favourite game has just got better.
Final whistle's enhanced features include:
*Two extra kits
*Look at any player attributes and skill
*New  corner  kicks with full control of  the  power,  height  and 
trajectory of the ball.
*Enhanced throw-ins and penalty shots
*New  two players team mode.  Player 1 in position or  nearest  to 
the ball and player 2 in position or keeper.
*Linesman and referee on the pitch
*A new player attribute,  Flair. A player with high flair will try 
a solo attempt at the goal.
*4 new pitches - Wembley - Icy - Muddy - Non-league
I canna wait mun!

FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER by MIRRORSOFT
Spectrum Holybyte, Authors of Falcon, present a game that took the 
PC world by storm.  Great graphics and depth make this a game well 
worth looking out for. Features include:
* Up to 8 friendlies and 4 enemy aircraft on screen.
* 2 different aircraft
* Enemy artificial intelligence
* Switch between aircraft in flight
* MEATBALLS (??)
* In flight radio
* View from all aspects and in 14 cockpit views
* Large number of mobile objects such as trucks,  trains and onion 
barges.


GAZZA 2 by EMPIRE
Following on the heels of the dire Gazza comes Gazza 2. 
Features include:
* Synthesized Geordie voice sings "Fog on the Tyne" everytime  you 
score.
* Digitized crying scene if a yellow card is produced!
*  Publicity  stunt  simulator.  How many tabloids  can  you  make 
headlines in in 48 hours?

GETTYSBURG by ARC
This is the third in the BattleScapes series, another one of those 
well programmed wargames. You either luv 'em or fall asleep at the 
mere  mention  of one of them.  This one is a  simulation  of  the 
American  civil war.  There was a big scrap between 70,000  troops 
under the wild party animal General Lee and 90,000 union  soldiers 
under  the  manic depressive and all  round  boring  git,  General 
Meade. You also get a free pen!

GLOBULOUS by INNERPRISE
Pacman in a 3D isometric form!
You wander round tiles containing various traps,  spikes, goodies, 
spinner tiles and nasties.
You  have fifteen minutes to complete each  level,  and,  as  Paul 
Daniels says,  'Every Second Counts' as you bloe your way  through 
the barriers with your dynamite and blow your nose.

GODS by RENEGADE
"I know we are!"
The Bitmap Bros's egos grows several million times as they release 
this autobiographical game.
Steve 'Smelly' Kelly, Eric 'Bananman' Matthews and Mike 'Mediocre' 
Montgomery  say  "Piss  off!" to Mirrorsoft and  join  Rythm  King 
records to form a new software label.
I must say I'm a big fan of the Bitmap Bros,  though I didn't like 
Xenon  and I don't see why they should get any credit for Xenon  2 
when the Assembly line coded it.  I love Speedball and Speedball 2 
promises to be even better. 
Gods looks absolutely stunning,  but I suppose any game would look 
great if it had Mark Coleman doing the graphics.  It is an  ultra-
smooth  eight-way  scrolling arcade adventure.  And  I'll  say  it 
again, the graphics are Bodacious!
Its  good  to  see  that Steve Kelly has  the  right  attitude  to 
programming.
"We set ourselves the goal of making Speedball faster than  Xenon, 
producing  big alines on screen while ensuring the  program  still 
ran  smoothly.  We have some of the best graphics  artists  around 
(very true) so we concentrate on our weakest element - sound."
Mike  Motgomery  that  sound  in  games  didn't  use  to  be  very 
important.  "we  use to set aside very small amounts.  But  things 
have changed.  Eventually we will be using STE facilities to their 
full potential."
The good news is Gods will have enhanced STE features.
This is  going to be a mega-game! I can't wait!

HARD DRIVIN' 2 by DOMARK
The  follow  to  the  game  that  made  you  want  to  shout   out 
"OOOOOEEERRRR!" at the top of your voice.
Hold on tight to someone tights are you roar round four  thrilling 
new  circuits  ("roar"  - my impression of  someone  playing  Hard 
Drivin').
HD2 also includes a track editor,  now you can really make a great 
stunt track. You can also link up to a friends ST, Amiga or IBM PC 
(How can you call someone with an IBM a friend.)
Domark tell us to drive harder. So if your parents find you 'hard' 
at it, blame it on Domark!

HORROR ZOMBIES by MILLENIUM
At last, a game about Douglas Hurd! 
I  don't  know much about this one,  but it'll  probably  be  crap 
anyway.

IT CAME FROM THE DESERT by MIRRORSOFT
Revenge of the killer blancmange!
Cinemaware's B-Movie simulation will soon be showing on your ST.
The  peaceful  community of Lizard's breath is  disrupted  by  the 
landing of a meteorite in nearby fields.  Villagers are  surprised 
when giant ants start eating everyone.
They  came from the desert,  but you must stop them  reaching  the 
Ant-arctic!

IVAN 'IRONMAN' STEWART'S SUPER OFF ROAD RACER by VIRGIN
Coded  by  expert coders graftgold who've brought  you  such  mega 
games  as Rainbow islands.  This is a super sprint  variant,  four 
cars race against each other round a one screen track. Nitro boost 
can  be picked up but it your skill at driving that will  see  you 
through this title.
What Ironman has to do with it escapes me.  Maybe he makes a guest 
appearance somewhere in the game!

JUPITER'S MASTERDRIVE by UBISOFT
And  to  think such a big planet could only afford such  a  crappy 
console.  This is a racing game in which you 'brum' round metallic 
tracks  in  little  buggy  things.  There are  18  circuits  on  9 
different moons and a two player option.  I hope Ubisoft use their 
excellent BAT cartridge for the sound. Chirp.

KILLING CLOUD by IMAGE WORKS
Won't they ever stop acid rain?  Vektor Grafix (Star wars,  Empire 
strikes  back,  fighter bomber) new release looks quite  good.  It 
features some rather tasty looking 3D graphics in a game where you 
join  the  San  Fransisco police department and  have  to  uncover 
sinister mysteries.  You also get to interrogate crooks.  Me,  I'd 
strip  their clothes off,  chain them to the table and  whip  them 
severely with some...(Control youself man! - Ed)

LEGEND OF FAERGHAIL by RAINBOW ARTS
Dungeon  and dragons must be the best non-computer game  ever.  It 
lends  itself so easily to becoming a computer game,  but no  game 
has  yet successfully converted the fantastic atmosphere of  role-
playing onto computer. Will this be the first game to do this?
Legend  looks similar to 'Bards Tale' with some neat graphics  and 
effects. 
The Elves have turned evil and are wreaking havoc across the land. 
Why has this happened?  What has someone done to anger this  noble 
and peaceful race?  Who stepped on the big elven chief's toe?  You 
have  to  find out what has happened to the  once  friendly  green 
'uns.
This  is an absolutely massive game,  and lets hope its  massively 
good.

LINE OF FIRE by US GOLD
Sounds like and Operation Wolf clone to me.
Will appeal to the under 10s.

MAGIC POCKETS by RENEGADE
Thos Bitmap Bros are at it again!
This  will  be  their first release under their  new  record  come 
software label, Renegade. It is all about a 'cool' kid, the Bitmap 
kid,   with dark sunglasses who whenever he puts his hands in  his 
pockets he gets a big smile on his face.
Bitmap kid must hunt around a playfield for his lost toys.
Sound certain to get an 18 certificate.
 
MASTERBLAZER by RAINBOW ARTS
If  you remember Ballblazer (unlikely) then you'll be thrilled  to 
hear that an upgraded 16-Bit version is to be released!  Whoopeee! 
Up to eight players can blaze each other in this enhanced  version 
which  boasts  new tournaments and training  modes.  It  also  has 
ultra-smooth  3D  graphics  and amazing sound  which  is  randomly 
generated so it will probably sound like a cat walking on a piano.

MIG-29 by DOMARK
You are the famous Russian stud Mig, and you have 29 every night.
Except your not. This is a flight sim that puts you in the driving 
seat  of  a  Mig-29 fulcrum.  You can fire missiles  or  use  your 
cannon (I won't even think about saying oo-er).  You have  cameras 
on all your missiles (Seems a stupid place for a camera to me) and 
you can watch with glee as they hit their targets.  If this is the 
kind  of thing that turns you on then watch your shelves for  this 
game in the next month.

M.U.D.S by RAINBOW ARTS
You  are player manager in this Mean Ugly Dirty Sport.  The  teams 
are made up of convicts (Sound like a Tory cabinet).  The frisbees 
are  alivem the bookies are hungry,  the fans are anxious and  I'm 
confused. 
There are sixteen opposing teams,  each made up of weird creatures 
and four different settings. Mean.

MYSTICAL by INFROGRAMES
Donning  your  Mickey  Mouse cloak,  you  turn  into  a  sorcerers 
apprentice.  While  practicing  some  card tricks  you  manage  to 
destroy  the  Socerers  350  year old  collection  of  spells  and 
potions. As you can imagine he's pretty pissed off.
You  must recover all the spells in this vertically  scrolling  3D 
magic hunt. One or two players can compete, and your going to need 
all the 24 spells you know to defeat the evil powers.

NAM by DOMARK
This isn't just the sound you make when you eat a ham sandwich, it 
is also the slang term for Vietnam, everyones favourite hellhole.
Nam  is  a  massive strategy game that has  taken  four  years  to 
complete.  You  have  to take political,  mititary  and  tolietary 
desicions.  You can either play the whole campaign from 1965-75 or 
play  an  independant  scenario.  It  will  probably  all  end  in 
tears(gas).

NECRONOM by LINEL
Remember that classic shoot 'em up,  insanity fight? While neither 
do I,  but this is the follow up. Specifications look highly tasty 
over 400 screens,  more than 300 different aliens, 25 end of level 
guardians,  32 different levels with 11 different backgrounds  and 
3000 frames of animation and 250 free tins of dog food. 

NIGHT SHIFT by US GOLD
You  are Fred Fixit,  and you work in the magic factory.  He  must 
keep  all the machines in factory running through the night so  it 
will  turn your Coronation Street type house into a humungous  Cwm 
Towers like house with 8 bedrooms (I often need 8 bedrooms!). 
Some  machines  make Lucasfilm characters such as  R2D2  and  Luke 
Skywalker. A little computer people clone.

NINJA REMIX by SYSTEM 3
Never  before  released on 16-Bit!  I seem to  remember  System  3 
saying  it  was  too shit to be released.  Now  Norman  Cooke  has 
remixed it (I don't think so!). The advertising blurb says:
"True  life  animation arcade  quality  backgrounds.  covers  four 
double  sided disks.  Last Ninja remix has the best  graphics  yet 
seen on a 16-bit machine. It's perfection"
I think one of the Codemasters must have written this!

OOPS UP by THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS
Dum. Squeek. Dum Dum. Squeek. Dum. Squeek.
TSB's  new  release  is a hybrid,  they  got  breakout  and  space 
invaders to breed,  and this is the result,  a violent mutant with 
lots of balls.
Shoot the bouncing balls until they get so small they disappear in 
this 100 level game with digitised music from Snap.
I can't help feeling that this game is identical to Ocean's  Pang. 
I smell shouting and hefty sueing imminent! 

RODLAND by SALES CURVE
This is a game lots of people with hands up birds' bums.
I really fooled you then didn't I?
This  is a terrifying conversion of the Jaleco  arcade.  Dare  you 
face  the bloodsucking rabbits?  What about the  scary  seals?  Or 
the..please  no more!  I'm crapping myself at the mere thought  of 
it! Quick do the next preview!

SIM CITY GRAPHICS by MA HAT DOESN'T FIX
Great  game dat sim city fing wasna it?  Shame da grfix wer a  bid 
dull. Like mee i s'poze.
Thank you Mr Boring.  Maxis are on the brink of releasing a set of 
disks  that  give  you extra GFX  for  everyone's  favourite  town 
planner simulator.
Disk 1 - Ancient cities:
Ancient Asia, Medieval Times, Wild West and the Calm East
Disk 2 - Future cities:
Future American, Future Europe, the Moon and Abermule.

SIM EARTH by SOME DUDES WEARING SILLY HATS
Remember Sim City (and who can forget it?) the most addictive town 
planner game that ever appeared on the home computer.  In mid 1991 
Sim earth will be released by Ocean and will probably have  Arnold 
Schwatzenegger kicking shit out of commercial zones.

SPEEDBALL 2 by MIRRORSOFT
This will be the Bitmaps last title under mirrorsoft,  and it will 
probably  be there best.  Bigger  pitch,  better  animation,  more 
intelligent opponents (Invite Einstein round to play against  you) 
buy  and  sell players,  go to the gym!  More fun  than  songs  of 
praise,  and a lot more violent, but perhaps it doesn't contain as 
much sex. (Thora Hurd-phoarr!)

SWIV by SALES CURVE
From the guys who bought you Silkworm comes SWIV. Those of you who 
remember Silkworm wirll have enjoyed long hours controlling either 
a  helicopter or a jeep in a great shoot 'em up.  Now  from  sales 
curve  comes  a "totally new and  original  game.  Its  completely 
different to Silkworm"
It is a one or two player shoot-em-up.  You control either a  jeep 
or a helicopter. It even begins with the same letter.

PANZA KICK BOXING by US GOLD
Another  sensitive title is released from the delicate stables  of 
US GOLD.
Eight rufty tufty computer opponents are ready to kick you about.
Alternatively,  what  better  way  to get to know  a  friend  than 
kicking his head in with the generous two player option provided.

POWERMONGER by ELECTRONIC ARTS
From  the authors of Populous comes an absolute corker of a  game. 
There  is  a  lot more depth and detail in it  than  populous  and 
gameplay  you could only dream of.  This will keep you up  to  the 
early hours!

PROFLIGHT by HiSOFT
From the chaps who bought that excellent addictive game, Devpac 2, 
comes  'Tarts with wings'. 
You get to fly the fastest aircraft in the world at ground  level, 
a Panavia Tornado. You can fly at speeds of up to Mach 2.2. 
You  can  fly peaceful missions (yawn!) or roar into  full  attack 
with cannons, missiles and bums. 
If  you Mach was just something you did to a pot of tea,  boy  are 
you wrong!

ROBOCOP 2 by OCEAN
Garunteed to top the charts for 400 years.
This will probably be the worst game you've had the misfortune  to 
play since Robocop 1. 

ROTATOR by RAINBOW ARTS
Rainbow  arts were originally going to call this game Potator  but 
it sounded too similar to a certain well chewed vegetable.
Naughty  aliens  who deserve their green pimply  bottoms  spanking 
have  attacked  man's defence system destroying the  vital  pylons 
that connect all the generators to Central base.  Civillisation is 
completely cut off from its energy source and that means having to 
light a candle to read ST Format and no more games of Kick Off  2, 
at  least until you can re-establish an energy  connection.  Climb 
aboard  the ultimate machine,  Roatator,  and blow away all  alien 
scum before they reach the generator.
Split screen display,  two player optionm realtim zoom and  highly 
intelligent  opponenets  add  spice to this game as  do  the  high 
quality 11 digitised soundtracks. Beep.

RUBICON by HEWSON
What would be the first name you choose for an island decimated by 
an  explosion  of  a  soviet nuclear  power  plant  and  now  lies 
wallowing  in radioactive goo?  Not three mile island,  but  Koala 
Island. How appropriately titled!
All  the lovely diddy fluffy creatures here have transformed  into 
mean ugly Nigel Lawson clones and are Rampaging the lands.
You must wipe out these muties by travelling through eight (8!!!!) 
levels,  each incorporating two (2!!!!!) level parallax scrolling. 
Blimey O'Reilly.

SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND by LUCASFILM
From the people who brought you Indy, Zak McKracken and Loom comes 
another stunning adventure.  The graphics look truly stunning  and 
the  game  play area is massive (Rather  like  my...).  Already  a 
highly respected PC game,  look out for this on an Atari near  you 
soon!

SECRET WEAPONS OF THE LUFTWAFFE by LUCASFILM
The  luftwaffe had many secret weapons like boring you  to  death, 
eating smelly garlic sausages and belching beer. Terrifying eh?
Now  you  must join the US 8th air force campaign to  tickle  Nazi 
Germany to death.
You  can  fly  old American tin can planes  and  dakka  at  German 
aircraft.  If  you  enjoyed Battle of Britain then  your  probably 
already running around the room whooping at the top of your voice. 

SHANGHAI II : DRAGON'S EYE by ACTIVISION
If you've ever seen those games on PD where you place blocks  with 
weird symbols on them over each other,  you know,  the ones  where 
the  instructions are always in German.  You either loved  'em  or 
said "What the hell is happening here?"
Now  Activision  have  released  the  'Battle  Chess'  version  of 
Shanghai  with  animated  sequences based  on  the  animals  which 
represent the years in the chinese calender.
What'll be next,  Ludo with humurous animations?  What will happen 
when two counters land on the same square?!!!

SPELLBOUND by PSYGNOSIS
Coded  by Wayne 'I think I'm an ace programmer,  but I can't  even 
get  Blood Money to scroll properly' Smithson.  This is  a  cutesy 
platform  game  in  which you wander  about  collecting  keys  and 
opening chests. What a plot! 

STORMOVIK by ELECTRONIC ARTS
Based around the famous(!) SU-25 attack fighter,  Stormovik places 
you  in the Red Guard strike force - this doesn't mean  you  skive 
off work complaining about conditions, nay, you are an elite arial 
assualt team!  As you are promoted you get better weapons but  the 
missions  become  harder.  The  final  mission  involves  a  power 
struggle between the great soviet leader and evil terrorists.  The 
failure of these missions could mean the start of world war 3,  or 
maybe just the severe eating of a rich tea biscuit.
Stormovic  uses  impressive 3D graphics,  not thats unusual  in  a 
flight  sim!  This is the first game I've seen where the  Russkies 
are the good guys!

TEAM SUZUKI by GREMLIN
What a surprise!  Gremiln are releasing a racing game. After Combo 
racer,  Supercars,  Lotus  turbo espirit challenge and  Celica  GT 
rally.
Early screenshots of this game make it look like days of  thunder, 
but I hope its not that bad.

TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES by IMAGEWORKS
You've seen the goo, you've eaten the pizza, now buy the game.
Shredder has captured April O'Neill and the herioc turtles  decide 
rescueing her will be even more exciting than eating a sausage and 
ice cream flavour pizza.  This is a platform style beat-em-up that 
despite all the hype may still be quite good. Cowabunga.

TOTAL RECALL by OCEAN
As this game is by ocean it will probably be renamed:
Total Shit
Sorry  guys,  but  your games really are crap except  for  Rainbow 
Islands and that wasn't even writen in house.

TURRICAN 2 by RAINBOW ARTS
Remember  that  great game with scrolling at 50 frames  a  second, 
exceptionally smooth sprites,  beautiful colour  changes,  massive 
game  area  and Jochen 'Hippy' Hippel  music?  No,  not  breakout, 
Turrican!  Well here the sequel imaginatively called Turrican 2. I 
can't wait! 

TV SPORTS BASKETBALL by MIRRORSOFT
If  Cinemaware  can bodge this up as much as they  did  TV  Sports 
football  then look forward to a seriously bad game.  I  was  less 
than impressed with the Amiga version,  but if you are the kind of 
person who at the mere thought of slam-dunking has an orgasm, then 
the array of features in this game may satisfy you:
* Full court five on five action (Sounds fun!)
* Life-like players
* Unlife like killer bananas
* Different heights, looks, speed, shooting skills and flavours
* Create players and edit them to suit you own strategies
* Watch rookies mature
* Watch cookies get eaten
* Timeouts, substitutes, instant replays, instant whip
* Choose different offensive and defensive strategies 

VIZ : THE GAME by VIRGIN
This isn't a straight forward rude-em-up,  sex-em-up,  piss-em-off 
or a punch-there-hedz-in, but a race game!
There are three competitors,  Johnny Fartpants,  Buster Conrad and 
Biffa  Bacon.  You pick the one who most suits your character  and 
then get on your marks (but not on anyones spencers).
The race is run over five locations:
The countryside,  the beach,  the town,  the building site and the 
disco. (I can see you're impressed so far!)
Roger  Mellie provides irellevent commentary and the game will  be 
littered with expletetives. Thats swearing to you. Bit like Maggie 
I suppose. Fuck.

WELLTRIS by INFROGRAMES
By the famous Ruskie programmer, wotsisname. This is the follow up 
to  Tetris.  Instead of blocks falling into a 2D  pit,  this  time 
they're falling into a 3D pit.  The third in this series  probably 
has them falling into a 4D pit.
This looks very similar to blockout.  Don't expect great  graphics 
or sound, but do expect mind frazzling addictiveness.

WONDERLAND by VIRGIN
Coded  by  those adventure  masters,  Magnetic  scrolls,  this  is 
claimed to be the largest ever animated graphic  adventure.  You'd 
be mad as a hatter not to get this.

WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER by ELITE
Only  just missing the world cup (!!!!!!),  Elite have decided  to 
release a soccer game.  It supposedly contains "those small extras 
which  will  got towards making this soccer game truly  stand  out 
from the rest.  This is the most realistic football game ever  and 
the  only similarity with other soccer simulations is the fact  it 
has  22 players and a ball." Don't PR departments come out with  a 
lot of bullshit?  How do they do it!  I'm glad Elite remembered to 
put the ball in the game!

XIPHOS by ELECTRONIC ZOO
Another name that just slips off the tongue,  Xiphos is a game the 
promises much:
*  State of the art super fast 3D graphics (Well the red  herrings 
hadnothing  to do with it then!) Xiphos displays space  combat  in 
more detail than ever before.
*  Talk to aliens and meet strange creatures (Just like  the  Youg 
Conservative Club)
* Xiphos is not for the meek, pregnant, those of weak constitution 
or those suffering from heart complaints.
No  chance  of me playing this game then,  I suffer from  all  the 
above!

Z-OUT by RAINBOW ARTS
After the game that had everyone saying:
"Whats this X-Out then?  What does it mean?  Eh? X-Out pah! What a 
daft name!"
Comes the sequel, six levels of shoot-em-up action. This game also 
features  parallax  scrolling and 40 colours  on  screen.  Whether 
they're on screen at the same time remains to be seen.
