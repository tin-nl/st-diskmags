
  AHA HA HAR!! The missing article curse is on you again!!

  As you've guesssed,  this is another effort of mine which didn't 
make  it into Maggie 3,  here in all it's glory (?) and with  some 
extra bits added on - WOOF WOOF!! SAUSAGES!!!! - CHRIS

PS.  Please  bear  in  mind that the first part of  ROTTSPOT   was 
written  in August 1990,  it may seem a bit strange to you to hear 
me  complaining of the heat (amongst other things..) as it is  now 
definitely winter - I am writing this on the 9-12-90, a weekend in 
which  we  have had the first severe snow in the  U.K.  for  about 
three years, the sort of snow which shuts down everything, anyway, 
read and enjoy.. - Chris....

Well  firstly,  there is nothing worse than having a blank  screen  
waiting for you to be bedwettingly creative, witty and funny. Well 
o.k  you could be writing this in Kuwait ( and Neil's parents  are 
coming  to tea...) but this gets pretty low....the title bit  took 
out about half-an-hour which could have been spent more usefully.. 
It's a pity the ST is so boring when it comes to things to do  for 
titles.......

RIGHT!!  I now remember what I first wanted to do, an interesting, 
but  not  particularly  useful tip for DAMOCLES,  first  get  your 
Novabomb  and  detonators,  it is a good idea to follow the  guide 
printed  in ST FORMAT Sept issue (no.14..) if you do  not  already 
know,  and  instead  of  going to the comet DAMOCLES,  fly to  the 
planet  DION.  leave the bomb,  fly to a safe distance and blow it 
up, the planet is destroyed, and what follows over the next two or 
three  minutes I will leave for you to find out,  needless to  say 
though,  it is a damn fine cure for all your problems,  little and 
huge alike...........

Secondly,  some  thoughts on the second issue of the Maggie,  best 
represented in chart form.

1)  The  intro-demo,  a clone of CEBIT '90 by TLB.  It really is a 
very  good several minutes worth,  and many thanks due to The Lost 
Boys (and RED SECTOR too...)

2) COUNT ZERO..  I am not putting down MAD MAX in any way (who did 
the  bulk of the music for the second issue..) BUT WHERE  DID  YOU 
FIND THIS GUY! Can we expect more from him for the third issue!!??

3)  Diary  of a Baby..  Well what can I say???  A unique piece  of 
writing, without parallel anywhere in the world, unforgettable! It 
is sad to note that there seems to be little chance of a  'sequel' 
but   I  live  in  hope,   perhaps  they  will  remember  to   use 
'preservatives' the next time on the bus....
(  PS.  I  hope I don't sound like the sarcastic teacher with  the 
sort  of  mannerisms that get people locked up,  it really  was  a 
great piece of writing..)

Well  that represents the 'Top 3' bit,  (dis)honorable mentions to 
Paul Brennan who,  like me, owns a damn fine machine, the STE, and 
to  Harvey Lodder,  I hope he can get enough coal together to work 
his decrepi...I mean  STFM for the next instalment of 'The Bible.' 
Also to NEXT for their charts, MAD MAX, and everyone else involved 
in issue 2.....

A quick weather report...... It is the 10/08/90 and we are back to 
being very warm again,  with no rain,  so watch out all you Sahara 
Desert fans for thrills and spills near you!!!!!!

Now  we  are  a few days later (13/08/90 to be  precise..)  it  is 
getting   cooler  (HOORAY!!)  I  don't  normally   mind   heatwave 
conditions if I am sitting in a cane chair in the shade of a  tall 
tree,  with  a  cool  drink  in my hand,  the fact that  you  have 
precisely none of those things available at WORK just means it  is 
all  very  wearisome  instead.  To simulate where I  work  in  hot 
weather  just  take  several thick woollen  socks,  soak  them  in 
lukewarm water and then stuff them down your shirt for about seven 
or eight hours, I think you may get the general idea, which is why 
I am happier it is now getting a bit cooler.....

Anyway,  enough  of  the misery,  I am on holiday for a couple  of 
weeks  as from next week (HOORAY part 2..) So the weather  can  do 
what it likes from then (Ideally be very hot again....) I  believe 
that  the next Maggie issue (no.3) will be out in September,  just 
in  time  for the European CES.....Hello long queues,  hello  beer 
served   in   plastic   cups,   hello  sandwiches  made   out   of 
abovementioned  plastic cups that only cost slightly more than  an 
arm and a leg,  hello Software Mega-corps styrofoam and video-wall 
palaces that have NO GAMES for your machine but have instead, 1500 
views  of 'Arnie Schwartzeneggar bursting through a load of  plate 
glass  to 'celebrate' some big licence deal which will  ultimately 
lead to a load of over-hyped,  over-packaged and overpriced dollop 
being  'No.1 at Christmas.....Also,  on a much more positive note, 
hello  Lost Boys and TCB Tracker..In spite of the fact  I  usually 
come away with a splitting headache and incipient nausea (TOO MUCH 
BEER EH!!! -ED..) I think I will go down as usual this year....

Another  little  tip,  for  the Equinoxe  Soundtracker  (brilliant 
through my speakers whilst I'm waiting for TCB tracker...) is that 
it  can quite happily accept the ST Connexions .MOD  files  (disks 
260  and 372 in TLB P.D library) if you press 'esc to get  another 
directory  as usual...Not much of a tip,  but I hate typing in the 
names on the ST connexions disk, and this way is much easier....

I think this will do for now,  as I could probably go on all night 
(FWOOAAR!!!  WOOF WOOF!!!!  ETC) But one final thing.  Does SADDAM 
HUSSAIN own an AMIGA or what!!!!  If not, Should AMIGA-OWNERS club 
together  to buy him one,  as he is a perfectly brilliant honorary 
member of Amigadom..  If he keeps on going the way he is,  the guy 
could   will  feature  very  shortly  in  my  'Dead   celebrities' 
column........"So what was it like being NUKED???????"

That will most definitely do for now - Cheers  CIH (C) 13/08/90

PS..  We  are  currently debating a suitable 'handle'  as  writing 
under 'C.I.Holland is very dull,  one impertinent person suggested 
something,  and  I now have the difficult task of disposing of the 
body.........Yours, with shovel in hand...CIH

Pretty huh? 

Pretty  bloody pointless really,  it is now the 4th Dec 1990,  and 
time  to  bring  things  bang up to date.  This  is  the  ROTTSPOT 
ADDENDUM,  the idea is to combine this with what I wrote in August 
for  the Sept issue of Maggie (Oh how foolish we are when  we  are 
young...)  and  to  have  a,  hopefully very long  and  very  good 
ROTTSPOT for the Xmas Maggie...

Firstly then - My tip for getting a new computer without having to 
work  for  the money,  or steal it...  My mate John,  quite without 
trying  has  come by most of the money for a decent  chunk  of  PC 
Compatible  gear,  but  the same method can get you a mega STE  or 
Atari TT,  and in the event of really severe injury,  can get you 
something like an ATW Transputer workstation...

Q:- "Hang on,, did you say 'really severe injury..'"

Well  yes  I did,  this method isn't free of pain I'm  afraid,  it 
will all become clear in a minute..

All  it involves is hanging around the roughest club in town on  a 
Friday  night  anytime  after 11.00pm,  going up  to  the  biggest 
meanest and most pissed sonofabitch around and calling him a  "Big 
soft  Puff.." (Or the best local equivalent..) and let him do  the 
rest... 

Your  local  friendly CRIMINAL INJURIES  COMPENSATION  BOARD  will 
stump  up  the  readies  about six months to  a  year  later,  and 
Bobsyouruncle,  a  new computer,  without the hassle of that extra 
paper-round..

A FEW POINTS TO REMEMBER BEFORE YOU GO....

1:-  The  above  applies to the UK system  of  compensation  only, 
although I would imagine there is a similar system throughout  the 
different parts of Europe...

2:-  A few rough figures for your consumption,  c.œ1-300 for minor 
assaults,  probably c.œ1-5000 for something like a broken leg, and 
lets   say  œ10000-sky's  the  limit, for  really  nasty   multiple 
injuries...  Figures  can be verified by me as I work in insurance 
claims....

3:-  Let's not get too ambitious and overdo things eh?  You  can't 
really enjoy all your new hardware whilst stuck on a  life-support 
machine  with  plastic tubes stuck up your bott indefinately,  can 
you??

4:-  Finally,  We at Maggie DO NOT accept responsibility if anyone 
actually  tries this out,  you choose to get yourself in the shit, 
we can't get you out, OK?!

Next problemmmmm,,,,,, A CHARITY APPEAL,,,,,,,,,,

This is a special appeal to help those unfortunates in life, whose 
style of  writing is getting to resemble Sammy Joe's...

  HELP MEEEE!!!!!!

Sent as much money as you can to:-

CIH  charity appeal,  "If you haven't got a million œœœ ,  a half-
million will do...."

My  next  tip:-  How to upgrade your STE memory  cheaply,  like  I 
did...

Oh we are a fount of usefulness, this evening, firstly, I told you 
how  to  get a new computer for free (Well alright,  an arm and  a 
leg..) and now, how to upgrade your STE using SIMMS that only cost 
œ20.00..  Where do you get these miracle chips I hear you ask? Try 
the  advertisments in MACWORLD,  or some other similar publication 
for that very expensive machine..

"Excuse  me,  256k  SIMMS  only  costing  œ10 each,  a  bit  of  a 
misalignment  for  a  VERY EXPENSIVE MACHINE,,,  I  suppose  these 
people  routinely  defy gravity and go faster than  the  speed  of 
light for a living, do they??"

Well  I  must say I don't know,  I suppose that 256k SIMMS are  no 
longer  the  bees  knees in the  Mackintosh  community,  they  are 
probably  on  1  meg SIMMS and above by now...  That  pricing  may 
reflect the fact that 256k chips are obsolescent to them...

Still,  they  fitted  in  okay  into my STE,  MAC  SIMMS  do  look 
different, the board is the same length, but the chips are smaller 
and squarer than the Atari equivalents, still they've been in this 
machine  for about three weeks without any problems,  FIZZ!  BANG! 
THUD! 9uvefdpuiogja\sdxv (Only joking..)

You shouldn't have any problems, but it might be an idea to contact 
a Mac-owning friend, with some spare SIMMS and borrow them to test 
in  your machine..  This tip is only applicable to STE's with SIMM 
sockets,  or  standard ST's with something like the Evesham Micros 
SIMM  board..  Also note,  very recent STE's do not have SIMM ram, 
but  have their RAM chips soldered-in like STFM's (which is a  bit 
tight of ATARI really...)

I am now a few more days down the line, having attended the second 
annual  COMPUTER SHOPPER SHOW,  at Wembley Arena,  and what a good 
show  it  has  been!  There  wasn't a major presence  by  the  big 
software houses (Which may have helped !?!) but there were several 
other good features about it...

Firstly,  I  had a very pleasant and useful chat with SAMMY JOE of 
TLB  about  mainly.  Maggie related matters,  by the time you read 
this,  you  should  have  a good idea about some  possible  future 
plans,  at the same time, RIVERDENE PDL came up with every item of 
P.D.  I  was  looking  for,  this included several disks  for  TCB 
Tracker,  at time of writing (1.57pm, Sunday 9/12/90...) they have 
no less than twelve instrument sample disks for it,  these include 
all sorts of effects,  and even sampled C64 effects! (Yes! you too 
can be Rob Hubbard in your own home!) So well done to them...

There is also at least one Atari TT in the country now,  which was 
to be found on the 16/32 P.D stand, and I had a little fiddle with 
it,  incredibly  responsive  mouse pointer and all,  and generally 
came away with the things I set out to buy...  A novel innovation, 
peculiar  to  SHOPPER at the moment is the practice  of  the  box-
shifters in actually having newly-released hot-to-trot games,  not 
seen anywhere else as yet, I counted Amiga POWERMONGER, ST XIPHOS, 
and   SPINDIZZY  WORLDS  (which  is  being  reviewed  in   here..) 
Generally,  the  games on sale were desirable items,  which people 
wanted  to  get,  and  were able to get at  cheaper  than  normal 
retail  prices..  My  experiences  of most other  computer  shows, 
including the other 'Big' shows in the U.K.  have the box-shifters 
pushing  out piles of outdated crap in a desperate attempt to  get 
rid of the 'Dust-gatherers' on their shelves...

The 'SHOPPER' was split in two,  in the main exhibition hall,  and 
also  the  Hampton Room across the bridge,  and the Acorn  village 
(virtually  a  show  within  a  show...)  in  the  Greenwich  Room 
downstairs.  Those of you who went to last years show at Alexandra 
Palace  would  be struck by the fact that this year  it  was  much 
larger...  Even  so,  by  the time I left at 1.00pm,  the place was 
packed-out....

All in all,  a show which restores some of my faith in the concept 
of "Computer Shows.." 

Whilst I was with SAMMY JOE, we ajourned to the Press Office for a 
while  to get away from the crowds that were building up,  and did 
the following things......

1:- Drank 0.87 of a cup of coffee each..  (They were nearly out of 
the stuff...)

2:-  SAMMY  JOE obtained the use of 3,000,047 press  releases  and 
their plastic binders and wallets.....

3:- We redirected seventeen people to the COMPUTER SHOPPER  ADVICE 
CENTRE,  who  were  under  the impression that  the  Press  Office 
performed  that role and that we were in some kind  of  'Official' 
capacity (Not a chance.....)

4:-  Sat  comfortably,  NB.  Doing  this is VERY RARE at  computer 
shows, and talked awhile....

I  think that'll do for the SHOPPER Show for now,  Thanks to SAMMY 
JOE for taking the time to yakk with me.....

I  think  this DOC file is getting rather chunky,  my  biggest  on 
MAGGIE  IV,  so  time to move on the the last major topic  of  the 
day....

/////// HOPES & FEARS FOR 1991 - IN MATTERS ST-RELATED/////////

Well Atari, what are you going to do next year???

At  the  moment,  there are three million assorted rumours on  the 
future of the ST and future hardware. We'll start on the easy ones 
first......

Firstly,   the  'œ750.00-odd  machine  inbetween  the  TT  and  ST 
range'...  This  has  crystallised into actual hardware,  the Mega 
STE,  intended  to  replace the Mega-ST range...  Hardware  spec:- 
16mhz  68000  CPU,  2MB ram (expandable to 4MB),  new TOS (version 
2.0) and is available in the USA, translated to U.K. prices, would 
work  out  at œ930,  with mono monitor....  It is apparently to be 
marketed  with a Laserprinter and suitable DTP package as a  high-
value DTP solution.... This seems to represent a fresh poke at the 
U.S  business community,  and it is not certain when this  machine 
will be launched in the U.K. and Europe...

Also,  there  will  be  an STE 'Stacey'  portable....  The  really 
interesting  persistant rumours revolve around an ultra-high  spec 
console codenamed 'Panther' described variously as a '32-bit  Giga 
console' and having 24-bit colour,  certainly,  a machine designed 
to defeat the Nintendo Super-Famicon will appear next year.....

Here is where things become more clouded, there has been talk of a 
computer  based on the Panther technology,  code-named 'Jaguar' by 
some  computer publications,  but it is uncertain if this has been 
confused with the Mega-STE discussed earlier...

Finally,  the  best  one of all,  the ST-Format add-on  Transputer 
board  for the standard ST,  capable of 15-20 MIPS (pretty serious 
computing power!) retailing at c.œ3-400!!!!!!  If this has a basis 
in  real  life,  then  it counts as the ultimate  add-on  for  any 
computer on sale today!!!!!!  At the same time,  there is also the 
possibility  of  putting a Transputer into a TT (I think  this  is 
rather more likely...)

Whatever  Atari  are doing with the ST and new machines  over  the 
next  year,  it had better be good,  because the growing market in 
IBM  PC  hardware  emulators  is threatening  to  go  to  a  386SX 
configuration  supporting VGA graphics,  which will go beyond  the 
baseline  specification  of the good ol' ST...  In any event,  the 
future on the hardware side looks more interesting than for a long 
time....

Software,  there  seem to be a lot of really exciting developments 
in  the  games  world,  with an increased number and  emphasis  on 
original  concept  mega-games  such as MIDWINTER  II.  Most  major 
software companies consider a double-sided drive as the  'default' 
system, so less disk-swapping... On the minus side, licenced games 
will  still be popular with less discriminating buyers.  Lets also 
hope  that most of the 'exciting new mega-games' will actually  be 
released,  or make their estimated release date... For example, we 
don't  want  to see any repetition of the F29  RETALIATOR  cock-up 
with EPIC...  Why do Ocean splash out on full-screen ads for games 
which are six months or more off reaching the shelves???????

1990 saw an explosion of four-channel soundtracker programs, using 
AMIGA sound modules,  and able to "borrow" from that machine, just 
about   every  major  demo  crew  had  their  own   system   under 
development.  1st  Prize  to  TCB Tracker,  which graduated  to  a 
mainstream  product,  and  seems  to be in demand by  every  major 
softco  in the U.K.  - Games and demos in 1991 will have much more 
by way of digi-sound....

The  STE should have more in the way of specific software  support 
in 1991,  this year saw it slowly coming out of hiding,  and it is 
still early days for it,  so more enhanced games,  and some really 
breathtaking mega-demos (PLEASE!!)

Some fears now, Consoles..........

Consoles are riding in this Christmas on a wave of media hype, and 
will sell well,  like it or not.......  They are sold on the basis 
that they are more 'accessible' than computers,  pirate-proof, and 
the newer ones are technically superior in the important areas  of 
graphics  and  sound...  They  are  also expensive,  if  you  want 
anything decent,  the Sega megadrive costing œ189.95,  against the 
U.S.  price of $189.95 (work out the exchange rate for yourself..) 
Software  on ROM cartridge,  in spite of being pirate-proof starts 
at  œ30,  and  the  only way from there is  up...  A  keyboardless 
machine also limits your options, as to the types of games that you 
can play,  to the sort of arcade games that are,  well, limited in 
their scope and complexity.. Also, certain large Japanese Hardware 
manufacturers severely limit software development by third parties 
on  their  machine,  which  cuts out any chance of  innovation  in 
gaming,  and leads to a tired and derivative series of SUPER MARIO 
BROS (TM) clones instead......

Finally, consoles are very much for the younger ones, as witnessed 
by  the  crowds  of seven-year olds  wearing  Dayglo  Turtle  gear 
streaming  onto the Sega bus at the 'Shopper'....  I wouldn't junk 
your ST just yet...

Actually,  in  the  last but one paragraph,  I am being unfair  in 
calling all console games 'tired and derivative SUPER MARIO  BROS 
(TM) clones..' there are also tired and derivative R-TYPE  clones, 
STRIDER clones, SPACE HARRIER clones...............

Piracy,  this subject has been the focus of intense media interest 
over  the past two years,  and will continue to excite interest  in 
1991.  The  jury is still out as to whether it can fatally  damage 
the  prospects  of the ST and other 16-bit machines,  and  further 
measures  will  no  doubt be taken to reduce or stamp  it  out  by 
concerned  bodies...  PLEASE  PLEASE PLEASE!  no repetition of the 
ghastly  ELSPA  advertising  campaign " Lets split  on  nasty  ol' 
teecher,  get our own back on him,  and get a œ1000 reward because 
we're two little shits called Wayne......" Has anyone collected  a 
œ1000 reward,  just out of interest, have ELSPA checked up closely 
on the credentials and motivation of people giving information  on 
alleged pirates.......

I think, my brain having stalled, on to the last bit...

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Endpiece^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The last paragraph I am writing for Maggie IV, it is the 11.12.90, 
currently  10.36pm  (UK Greenwich mean time..) and  I  am  shagged 
out..  Just got to get this lot in the post to SAMMY JOE,  see you 
again next year,  merry Crimble an' all that,  perhaps see some of 
you at the 16bit Computer Fair in early Jan,,,,,,,

In the meantime, look after yourselves, and get pissed lotsa times
