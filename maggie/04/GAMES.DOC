	soundest strategies. Everything that could conceivably happen in
	real trading is reproduced in this simulation. The  Index 'point
	and figure' chart unfolds before your eyes and reveals your profits
	or ...losses. Any open position carrying an excessive loss is 
	automatically  stopped. Closing balances are saved to disk.
