Chris H attempts to do something brave and stupi....Different

Christmas roughly coincides with the release date of Maggie IV

Without further ado, heeeres the first "prose poem" in Maggie
which is about, well, CHRISMUSS! Cheers! CIH.....

        MERRY BASTARD CHRISMUSS THING.........

   Twas, (I hate things that start with 'Twas' - no imagination)
Chrismuss Eve, Ittwas a clear and frosty nighhkt...

Wayne  and  Jeckyl  (WOT!)  were waiting for  good  'ol  Santa  to 
arrive.. Loadsa pressies he would shurely bring....

Instead, mean ol' dad he raised his gun into th' air... Fired once 
and  then announced...  "CHILDREN,  Father Christmas has committed 
suicide..."

"Well thats a cun...Bit of a sod then!"  Wayne replied,  "Time for 
a quick blast of formaldehyde.."
(It was Bath-cleaner actually, but that does not rhyme....)

One quick sniff, away their troubles flew... and into a magic land 
full of pixies and golden mushrooms, and Paddington Bear driving a 
Ferrari Testarossa andandand........

Bleeuuuuurrrg! Throw it all up little ones.... Anyway pixies arent 
usually fifteen feet tall, with green fangs.....

"As dad's down the boozer, lets get looser!" says Jeyckl "See what 
we find in his SPIRITS CUPBOARD!"

Three bottles of vodka,  two of scotch,  something you can't put a 
name to,  that came back from the South of Spain last summer, some 
mixers, and "LETS HAVE A PARTY!" they both cried.....

Glug   Glug!   down   it   went,   half  an  hour   later,   Wayne 
said.."Duuurrrhh whaddarya anyway a shhhtring quartet..?!?!?"

To a plant pot.....

About now, SANTA appeared, in green wellies, a skimpy leotard, and 
a  festive  fur hat,  ready to corrupt morals but he saw that  his 
'assistance' was not needed.

Instead, he said "CHILDREN! what is going on!"

Wayne said "Ahhh fuurrrgoff ya Bassterrrd" but told him anyway..

"So,  his  tosspot  dad thinks I'm dead does he!!   I'll soon deal 
with that..." spake santa

And with that,  wired the house to explode,  drank all the cans of 
beer  in  the fridge,  and dropped in on mum as well,  leaving her 
well fucke... contented.

As he prepared to leave, found Jeckl being sick in his sleeve...
(Oooo look, another bit that rhymes!!)

Santa,  a  bit  miffed  chucked him o'er the  wall,  Jekyl  landed 
headfirst, his least important bit....

Santa  strode  of chuckling "Come an'geddit Reindeers,  that  mean 
sonofabitch won't arf be surprised when his house explodes..."

And with that, rode off into the clear and frosty nighkkkt...

Dad  arrived,  slightly  less reality than a rabid goldfish,  full 
symptoms  of 'Lunatic Soup',  the local brew revealed....  Pressed 
the doorbell......

"NO DAD WAIT!!!" yelled Wayne....

TOO LATE.... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!!!!!

                    .....The end......

 Merry Christmas! from Chris H, see you all again next year....
