 PROGRAM:-  Microstyle/Graftgold..
 
 REVIEWED:-  CIH (of course..) 

Well  hi  there  again,  in what promises to be a very  busy  week 
maggie-wise,   for  reviews,  heeeeeeeeres  Simulcra,  the  latest 
interpretation  of a solid 3D theme,  which bears some resemblance 
to the great VIRUS ( VIRUS by Dave Braben, not Ghost, Green goblin 
etc by A. Shithead...) 

Simulcra  has done very well for itself in the computer press,  so 
much so,  Microprose even used the ACE review (ACE rating 936) for 
a full-page advertisement,  with the comment, " Well what more can 
we  say.."  - Well words to that effect anyway..  Now that I  have 
been  able  to get hold of it for myself,  so will  Microprose  be 
using  my  words  for a future promo of the  thing  (We  doubt  it 
somehow!!)

Anyway,  to kick-off,  Simulcra does indeed bear some considerable 
resemblance to VIRUS,  in its look and feel,  using a very similar 
ultra-fast   isometric  solid  3D  viewpoint,   with  super-smooth 
lightsourced shaded polygons, and loads of little particles thrown 
about  the place when you blow something up,  the whole effect  is 
very pretty to look at, but not novel, as VIRUS has already broken 
that technological ground.  There is a spectacularly good start-up 
sequence at the beginning of each level,  mixing solid 3D and some 
excellent  backgrounds,   the  whole  lot  keeps  moving  smoothly 
throughout,  with nary a flicker,  and sonically speaking, manages 
to  utililise  chip  sounds,  in a minimalist  fashion  where  the 
gameplay requires it.  There is also a decidedly average soundchip 
tune for the title screen.

So much for how it looks, what is it like to play? 

Well  very  much easier than VIRUS,  controls via the joystick  or 
mouse,  you  are  given the option of manouvreing on  the  'solid' 
parts of the matrix,  or by pulling the stick back when moving, by 
flying  around..  In  case you have forgotten,  the scenario is to 
dismantle the Battle-Matrix where weekend Virtual-Reality warriors 
normally go for a quiet hour or two, it is not quiet as the Matrix 
has  gone  bonkers,  so it is up to YOU the  professional  matrix-
dismantler to restore some kind of equilibrium thing to it.

(It  is interesting how a lot of games these days are sold on  the 
back of 'The big computer in charge suddenly malfunctioned and  it 
is up to one man to stop it...' Interesting,  no?  ) Anyway,  with 
the helpful parting shot "Don't fuck up or we're all in it.."  You 
go  in  to take out the matrix,  level by level.  This is done  by 
shooting out the matrix controllers,  and cutting out parts of the 
red energy barriers, until you reach the end of the level. Enemies 
come  in all shapes and sizes,  including various stationary laser 
turrets, small rat-like scout vehicles, aircraft, and tanks, which 
need a fair bit of welly to destroy, many of these when destroyed, 
leave various power-ups,  extra shields,  ECM,  etc.  You may also 
like  to  note that contact with the energy barrier,  drains  your 
shields,  and  can  be  ultimately  fatal,  this is  something  to 
ESPECIALLY note when you are flying.

The pace of the action,  can get frantic,  especially when you are 
in  a situation where you are going too fast (Lost control  whilst 
flying...) but overall this is much easier to get into than Virus. 
You start off easily, but the levels soon get bigger, fortunately, 
there is a map of the level, with a large "You are here" arrow for 
your present location.  Indeed,  with extra lives and powerups, to 
be found, it is possible to go on playing for quite a long time.

In conclusion:- Well I'll let the ratings do the talking...

GRAPHIX:- 91% - An excellent interpretation of the solid 3D theme, 
shadows,  light  intensities,  stipples,  loadsa  little particles, 
some   nice   3D   objects,   a   brilliant   starting   sequence, 
unfortunately,  no longer novel,  as VIRUS did this ages ago,  but 
very well done, and smooth too...

SONIX:-  59% - Limited participation here,  as the graphics  steal 
the  show,  limited  to  a space-filler title  tune,  but  in-game 
effects are appropriate to the action..

PLAYABILITY:-   87%  -  Blends  elements  of  VIRUS,   and   ROTOX 
successfully,  is  quite  easy  to get into,  which is a boon  for 
people  who  liked the look of VIRUS,  but found the controls  too 
difficult. For hardened gamesters, this could be a bit too easy in 
the long run?

OVERALL:-  88% - A successful amalgam of concepts,  but is  anyone 
going  to take the trouble to play ALL the matrixes?  (Matrices??) 
as after a while, all the matrixes look the same anyway.... If you 
are  getting  it,  I suggest mail-order to take the sting  of  the 
œ24,99 price away....

  This has been another CIH review - 2.12.90
