A review by Leon O'Reilly

This game, after topping the charts last year, is doing the rounds 
on  compilations  and  is often seen in  the  bargain  columns  of 
adverts. So what's it like then?
My first suggestion to any prospective buyer of this product is to 
watch some American Football:
8.00 PM, Sunday, Channel Four - Live action
5.30 PM, Friday, Channel Four - Round up of results and interviews
If you like it, great! 
If  you  don't,  watch it more than once.  There are  always  some 
extremely boring games, and inevitably, some good ones.
TV Sports Football (Hereafter TVSF) is a simulation,  so its not a 
game you can pick up and master in five minutes,  like Kick Off it 
takes time and practice.
TVSF comes on one single sided disk in a very misleading box.
On the back of the box are six screenshots of the game.  Only  two 
of these are actually featured on the Atari ST version.
The blurb on the back says:
"....looks exactly like a TV transmission....Included at no  extra 
charge are these TV Sports exclusives:  Announcers,  cheerleaders, 
fans  in  the stands and a  halftime  show...includes  "pushbutton 
statistics"  to  view top performers in the league....SO  REAL  IT 
SWEATS"
This is all utter shit.
It  doesn't look like a TV transmission,  for a start there is  no 
Mick Luckhurst.  Unlike the Amiga version there are no Announcers, 
cheerleaders  or  fans.  There is no halftime  show.  You  get  no 
"Pushbutton Statistics". And it definately doesn't sweat.
A lot of people are extremely pissed of with the game. Having seen 
the  excellent Amiga version it was bad enough waiting six  months 
for  the ST version to be released.  The Amiga version was on  two 
double  sided disks so how they expected to fit the whole game  on 
the ST onto one single sided disk, god alone knows.
What made the original so jazzy was the great graphic screens that 
Cinemaware  were  so  good  at,   showing  presenters  fans   etc. 
Cinemaware didn't even bother trying to convert these. OK, you can 
live without them, but they make the game 'prettier'.
What  is  a real bastard is they've left out all  the  statistics. 
Each  player had his own set of stats,  for example a quater  back 
had:
Attempts,  completions,percentage,  Average  yards,  Average/game, 
yards, Touchdowns, Interceptions.
Each  team member had statistics like these which are very  useful 
to see how well a player is achieving and if any of his attributes 
need altering.
The manual constantly refers to these 'pushbutton stats' which  is 
stupid because they're not on the program!
The start of the manual also say the game features these features:
"2 Player Vs. Computer" - No such feature!
"Complete team and individual stats" - Not complete!
"View league leaders in over 30 different categories"-No you can't
"Analyse stats by team, offense, defense kickers" - Nope!
"Bone crunching tackles" - None of my bones were crunched
"New league option allows you to play with up to 27 friends"-I can 
think of better ways of playing with 27 friends! 
I don't those monney grabbing scum at Mirrorsoft should be allowed 
to get away with releasing such a substandard game.  It is  surely 
illegal to claim your product does something it  doesn't.  Mirror-
soft  should  be punished.  I was going to  boycott  their  future 
releases,  but the trouble is they are probably the best  software 
house  on  16-bit with releases like Falcon,  Speedball  1  and  2 
Xenon 2 etc. My will wasn't strong enough! It really isn't mirrors
oft who are to blame but those MotherfuckingAmigasuckingshitcoders
Cinemaware.  Maybe  we  should hack and spread 'It came  from  the 
desert' before it sells in high quantities.  That'd sure wipe  the 
smile off there smug faces.
That was a public information broadcast by Leon O'Reilly.
Now back to the review.


GAME REVIEW

TVSF takes 40 seconds to load.
The loading screen is just some text telling you who coded it, who 
was the water boy(???) etc.
You  are  asked to insert a league disk but I keep all  my  league 
files  saved on the master disk as their is so much space left  on 
it. (Hint hint - Space for sampled sound or extra GFX perhaps?)
Once  it  has loaded,  you are presented with a  main  menu.  This 
consists of a clipboard and an American football as a  cursor.  In 
the background is a stadium. The menu options are:
EXHIBITION 
LEAGUE
PRACTICE
SCHEDULES
STANDINGS
If you want to go into a sub menu, it has to load it from disk.
EXHIBITION gives you the choice of a one or two player  game.  Not 
no two player team option.
LEAGUE give you the chance of a NEW SEASON or CONTINUE SEASON.
NEW SEASON gives you the chance to EDIT TEAM or SAVE LEAGUE.
You'll need to Edit your team.  Click your pencil on the team  you 
want  (My personal favourite is the L.A.  Raiders).  You  can  now 
alter the teams name,  change it from computer to human controlled 
or vice versa and you can alter players attributes.
Each team member has a rank from 1 to 17. you can of course change 
these  ranks.  The  rank refers to the amount of  points  you  can 
allocate  a  player.  The player whose ranked 1 can  be  given  24 
points, the player ranked 17th can only get 8 points. 
These  points  can be split up and awarded to the  following  four 
categories, Speed, Strength, Hands, Ability.
Each category can contain a maximum of 8 points and a minimum of 1 
point.  For  example  you'd  want  a  halfback  with  high  speed, 
receivers  with  a  high hands rating and  linebackers  with  high 
strength.  You  have  to decide which team members  are  the  most 
important and thus should be awarded the most points. 
You can also change the name of the players,  have a kicker called 
Bigfoot, a reciever called Buta Fingaz, the choice is yours.
The  CONTINUE SEASON option allows you  to,  surprisingly  enough, 
continue season. It displays all the fixtures and it allows you to 
put  each  fixture on Auto (It will be played  straight  away)  or 
Hold (It won't be played). 
Clicking on play cause the disk drive to whirr as it works out the 
results of each match and saves them to disk. The results are then 
displayed,  the  number  of points the winner has  accumulated  is 
shown in blue and the loser's amount is hsown in red. i don't know 
what  happens  if  they tie as this  almost  never  happens.  They 
should've gone to Scouts. Sorry, that was just my attempt at humor 
and it failed miserably.
SCHEDULES  shows  all  the fixtures for the  season  and  all  the 
results of matches that have already been played. 
STANDINGS shows all six tables from eastern divisions 1,  2 and  3 
and  western  divisions  1,  2 and 3.  The  tables  tell  you  the 
abbreviation  of the team and its number  of  Wins,  Losses,  Ties 
points for and points against. All rather exciting.
Before you play an exhibition or league game,  try PRACTICE.  From 
here you will first see the main desicions screen.  This tells you 
a multitude of things including the time in South Korea, time left 
in the quarter,  points scored per quarter,  total points  scored, 
teams playing,  which team is in possesion,  field position,  down 
number, yards to go. I lied about the South Korea bit.
You get to choose which play. On DEFENSE you have the choice of
4-3,  6-1,  3-4 or 6-1 key.  What does it all mean? Well the first 
number  is the sum of the lineman and the second is the number  of 
linebackers. Still don't understand it? When on 6-1 you'd have six 
men on the line which would make the run very hard to perform, but 
there are few men back to defend the pass.  On 3-4 there are  four 
men defending the pass but only three at the line blocking the run 
so there will be holes for the running back to run through.
With these formations there are four basic plays:
RUN INSIDE, RUN OUTSIDE, PASS DEFENCE, BLITZ
The Run Inside (Pinch) stops runs up the middle.
The run outside (spread) covers a wider area but leaves the inside 
slightly open.
In  pass  defense linebackers and defensive backs cover  the  pass 
using zone defence.
Offense is a bit more complex. The four basic plays are:
PRO-SET, I-FORM, SHOTGUN and KICK
The PRO-SET offers a blanced attack with two halfbacks and a  wide 
receiver.  This  is a very flexible and useful formation  which  I 
often use on short yardage as it gives you so many options.
I-FORMation is primarily for running moves.  It allows the running 
back  to  find a hole in the defensive  line.  From  his  starting 
position back can easily cut to the left or right.
To  run the ball you press fire at the start of the play.  The  QB 
hands the ball off to a running back, then you have to 'peg-it' up 
the field.
SHOTGUN - This doeasn't mean you shoot the opposition. It consists 
of  a  running back and two wide receivers.  This is good  on  log 
yardage as you can allow the receivers to run a long way downfield 
before you pass.
To  pass  you pull back on the joystick and the QB's  arm  becomes 
erect.  Moving left and right moves his arm and thus direction  of 
throw  left and right.  Pressing fire releases the ball and  an  X 
moces  up  the  screen until you let go of  fire.  The  ball  then 
travels  to  this X and you have to get your receivers to  this  X 
before the  defenders get there.
KICK give you three options:
PUNT  -  If you're on fourth down and you don't want to  risk  the 
oppositon gaining your current field position, you can punt - kick 
the ball as far upfield as possible.
FAKE  PUNT - This brings up a defensive fomation identical to  the 
punt formation.  The defense think you are going to punt and  drop 
back ready to receiv the ball giving you time and space to run  or 
pass with the ball.
FIELD  GOAL  - If you're in range (Inside the oppostions  50  yard 
line) then you can attempt a field goal.  Your kicker comes on and 
you  have to kick the ball between the post things at the  end  of 
the  field.  To do this you must study a football thingie  in  the 
corner of the screen.  Pull back on the joystick and a white  line 
will  start  rising  up the ball.  This is  the  horizontal  line. 
Pushing left and right moves the vertical line.  Where these lines 
cross is the point where you'll hit the ball.  Press fire to kick. 
If  you hit it on the right then the ball will move left and  vice 
versa.  If you kick when the line is low on the ball then the ball 
will travel high and short.  If you kick when the horizontal  line 
is near the middle of the line then the ball will travel long  and 
low,  but there is a greater chance of it being blocked. if you go 
past the halfway line then you will completely miskick.

GFX + SFX
Graphics are excellent throughout.  The sprites are well animated, 
and  the pitch scrolls smoothly.  The coin tossing section at  the 
start  also  looks  rather nice.  The best graphics  come  on  the 
kicking section with lots of big sprites moving about.
Sound is very sparse,  there is one good tune at the start of each 
game.  Unfortunately this is the only music in the game. The other 
effects  consists of a beep when you select the play and  a  whirr 
when you throw the ball. Hardly earth shattering

So how does it play?
Not  bad  actually.  Once  you've mastered thrwoing  the  ball  it 
becomes  a  really  enjoyable game especially  if  you're  playing 
against  a friend who doesn't know the first thing about  American 
football. As an action game, it is excellent fun but it hasn't got 
the depth needed for true long term appeal. 
It doesn't give you player statistics which would be very useful. 
The  halftime  show would look good and help sustain  interest  as 
would a bit more sound.
Another annoying feature of this game is that you have to turn the 
computer off after every game and reload if you have a 520. Also I 
would  like to see the option of changing the game length-I  don't 
always want to play one hour games!
Despite  all  these  gripes  it is a good  game  and  once  you've 
mastered  it you will begin to enjoy it.  If Cinemaware had  taken 
the  time and effort to program this properly then it  could  have 
been an all time classic. As it is its just a good game.
