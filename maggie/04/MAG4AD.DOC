Hello - we are proud to support THE LOST BOYS and anyone else promoting 
LOW COST FUN on the ATARI ST, which is what MAGGIE is all about (we hope).

And now a public service announcement.  If you are looking for Public Domain
Software and Shareware for your ST, then try us, because:
*	That's all we do.  No mouse mats or disk boxes, no commercial
	software, no club, no magazine, and definitely no other computers.
*	We've been going five years and have learned a lot.
*	Our catalogue is THE BEST and is still ABSOLUTELY FREE.
*	Fair dealing.  You don't pay for software you can't use.
*	Free help and support - nothing to subscribe to or join.

Quite simply, we offer a better service.  So if a better service is what you
are looking for, then why not find out more?  The next step is easy ...
