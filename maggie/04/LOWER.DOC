Millions of kilometres up, in the night sky, a blinding star shoots across
the night sky.  It pauses briefly above London town.  That night a child
is born.  A child with astounding powers over simple electronic devices,
that we now call computers.  That child was called Christopher.  Today,
his fans all over the world know him as -Z C T-.

HAIR STYLE: Slightly spiky with a parting down the middle.

LOOKS: Like a heavenly vision (!)

HABITS: Thinking of new ideas for screens.

FAVE SAYING: "That's life" or "Well, that's the way it goes".
             (Both excellent excuses for not doing somthing !)

CLOTHES: Jackets, trench coats, Levis jeans and personalised
         -THE LOWER LEVEL- tee-shirts.

FAVE COLOR: Black 

MUSIC TASTES: Electronic stuff, TECHNOTRONIC, DEPECHE MODE,
              and Jean Michel Jarre.
              
FAVE SONG: THE JACK THAT HOUSE BUILT and BLUE MONDAY.
           (If anyone out there has the Amiga .MOD file for
            these songs send it to me please !!!)

HOBBIES: Programming and watching films.
        
FAVE FOOD: Cheeseburgers (Especially from -THE TAKEAWAY- in Gloucester)

FAVE DRINKS: 1080, Diamond White, and SLUSH PUPPIE !!!
 
FAVE GIRL: If I list them all DISK MAGGIE would come on 4 disks !!!

FAVE POSITION: See above.

FAVE BOOKS: ST INTERNALS

FAVE COMPUTER: AMIGA (Just kidding !!!), Atari ST.

FAVE TV PROG: The New Statesman, Blackadder 2 & 4, Spitting image.

WORST TV PROG: Dance energy (The bloke who introduces it is the 
               biggest jerk I have ever seen !!!)

BEST FILMS: Robocop, Back to the future, Airplane II.

WORST FILM: Mosquito coast (Harrison Ford just can't act).

BEST NIGHT OUT: Hard to say, perhaps J.I.M.'s party or maybe Project '92.
                (The latter being a pretty good piss-up !!!)

BEST CONCERT: Although I've never been to one, JMJ in Paris seemed good
              on TV.
              
FAVE COMPUTER GAME: XENON II, I completed this without and cheats or 
                    an autofire (and I had a crap joystick !!!).
                    
FAVE ARCADE GAME: OUTRUN and HARD DRIVIN' (Both completed !). 

WORST GAME: Robocop (It's crap games like this that completely justifies
                     software piracy.  OCEAN was ripping off the public
                     completely, charging œ19.99 and getting sales just

WORST THOUGHT: Becoming a LAMER !!!

X-TRA : I would like to appologise to all people who were totally
        shattered to see that we were not at the computer shopper
        show as we promised.  We worked through the night to finish
        a mini-demo for the show and we finally completed it at
        3:30am.  Unfortunatly when we got up we saw that it had snowed
        just a little.  The coach to London was cancelled so we couldn't
        go.  As for THE UNDER-C demo we hope to release it next spring.
        We want lots of guest screens 'cos we want to save our very best
        screens for the next demo to be released this time next year.
        With any luck this will feature some sort of game.  Other details
        are TOP SECRET !!!
        We may be at the 16 bit computer fair in January.  We'll
        probably go on Saturday and we'll wear our LOWER LEVEL tee-shirts.
        
MORE >  My interview is the shortest of all the members of -TLL-.  This
        is because I was the only member of our crew who bothered to
        write some articals for Maggie.  If my other articals have not
        bored everyone to death you might see some more next issue.

YEAH :  The other guys have assured me that they will be giving me
        mega-bytes of articals to sent to Mike for next issue.
        
                                              -ZCT- of THE LOWER LEVEL

**************************************************************************

                              The
                   - LUCKY J.I.M. interview -
                          by himself...

A door opened and a married couple entered.  After copulating briefly,
they left and, nine months later, a child was born.  However, this was 
no ordinary child.  It possessed great powers of misfortune and was a 
manic depressive but when unleashed on a problem it produced a 
devastating whirlwind of algorithms.  Although it spends most of its 
time in a state of complete inebriety, it managed to type this 
interview between drinks.

NAME: Lucky J.I.M.

REAL NAME: James Morrissey

AGE: 17.

SEX: Male.

HEIGHT: Quite tall, I don't really know as I'm rarely sober enough to 
        stand upright.

WEIGHT: 69 kg.

STATUS IN TLL: Coder, procurer of alcohol and morale regulator.
               (When the crew members are feeling depressed, I make 
               them feel deeply depressed so that they sink to a LOWER
               LEVEL.)

NORMAL STATE: Inebriated, depressed, thinking about women or, 
              occasionally, thinking about how to optimize one of ZCT's 
              routines or, even more occasionally, writing one of my 
              own.
              (My code just CANNOT be OPTIMISED for speed - ZCT the modest)

HAIR STYLE: "I've just got up", copyright J.I.M. 1987

LOOKS: Through a pair of glasses, but I'm handsome underneath.

HABITS: Most are far too personal for this interview, but I do adjust 
        my glasses frequently and sigh, indicating that I'm not 
        experiencing the period of elation which the Concise Oxford 
        Dictionary grants a manic depressive in its definition.

FAVE SAYINGS: "So...who's buying the next round."
              "God I'm pissed off."
              "I'm not pisshed, honesshht."
              "What the F...?"

FAVE JOKES: Taking the micky out of anyone whose imperfections come to 
            my attention and any joke with a theme of depressing 
            failure.

CLOTHES: I like to wear black jeans and a LOWER LEVEL T-shirt, covered 
         up by my EQUALIZER overcoat and with black and white NIKE 
         trainers.  My intention is to indicate that computer 
         programmers are not boring and that I have a large and healthy 
         heterosexual appetite.  I like girls to wear the sort of 
         swimsuits that are frequently seen on Californian beaches 
         (according to the TV), i.e. the type that look as if they 
         could be made on Blue Peter with 3 sweet wrappers and 2
         shoe-laces.

FAVE COLOR: Black.

MUSIC TASTES: Quite varied, but mainly 'thumpy' house and acid tracks 
              such as those by Technotronic.

FAVE SONG: The Jack That House Built - Jack 'n' Chill

HOBBIES: Coding, pretending to be remarkably intelligent around 'adult 
         peers' (and in examinations), persuading bouncers that I'm 18 
         then getting pissed out of my head, writing depressing or 
         pessimistic poetry and running (with EROS' assistance) the 
         production department of a Young Enterprise company (whilst 
         also producing 3 page reports which lead to letters of 
         resignation and blood on the walls).  Other than that, I fight 
         suggestions that pornography causes sex offences and that 
         computer programmers are boring and have deep analytical          
         discussions about whether particular girls fancy certain 
         people or not.

FAVE FOOD: Chinese sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and prawn 
           crackers.

FAVE DRINK: Cider ('K', Diamond White or Strongbow) and Pepsi.
 
FAVE GIRL: Lorna Stanley (Although she never knew it, and she probably 
           never will, sob, sob...Alright, you can put away the 
           violins now.)

FAVE POSITION: *** CENSORED ***  (Don't get too caried away - ZCT)

FAVE BOOKS: Several, but mainly science fiction and some horror by 
            Stephen King.  I used to love 'Programming The Z80' by 
            Rodnay Zaks, but it never took off as a literary classic.
            Now I rarely have time to read some decent fiction, 
            although I'm reading 'Use Of Weapons' by Iain M. Banks and 
            it's pretty good so far.  Of the classics, I quite like 
            some Tolkien and some Shakespeare ('Hamlet' and 'A 
            Midsummer Night's Dream' (which bears an uncanny 
            resemblance to my love life at the moment, except for the
            happy ending.))

FAVE COMPUTER: Currently it's my STE, but I started in '81 with a ZX81 
               and progressed through the ranks of 48K ZX Spectrum and 
               Spectrum +3 before I arrived at an STE eight months ago.  
               I still defend the speccy though, I wrote my G.C.S.E. 
               Computer Studies project in Z80 assembly language and 
               used to rip music on the +3, so I attach a lot of 
               sentimental value to Clive's black babies (but not his 
               white 3 wheeled one.)

FAVE TV PROG: Black Adder, Miami Vice (so that bitch Whitehouse can 
              keep her hands off it) and plays by Dennis (humping is an 
              artform) Potter (and Whitehouse can keep her mouth shut 
              about them as well).

WORST TV PROG: Micro Live and any programmes which appear to be 
               promoting homosexuality.

BEST FILMS: Aliens, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (sob, sob), 
            The Seven Year Itch (Marilyn Monroe), Scarecrows, Robocop, 
            virtually anything ever done by Hammer Studios (yes, even 
            the silly 'Dracula meets Frankenstein' ones), and many   
            French films, particularly those featuring Isabelle 
            (Couldn't I wear my clothes for just one scene pleeease?) 
            Adjani.  Also anything with Arnie Schwarzenegger in.

WORST FILM: When Harry Met Sally (The restaurant bit is the only funny 
            scene in the WHOLE film!)

BEST NIGHT OUT: I don't think that I can remember it, but it probably 
                involved plenty of alcohol and some nice girlies, with 
                any luck (oops! There I go, forgetting that I don't 
                have any luck at all, that's why I'm called lucky 
                J.I.M.)

BEST CONCERT: Sorry, I've never been to one.

FAVE GAME: This is a difficult decision because I play around a bit 
           (oo-er).  Amongst my favourites are:
           ZX81:            Labyrinth, Star Trek.
           ZX Spectrum 48K: Green Beret, Mercenary (both cities),
                            Laser Squad and many, many others.
            "     "    +3:  Cybernoid, Carrier Command, Gunship, Cabal.
           STE:             F-19 Stealth Fighter
           Arcade:          Star Wars.

WORST GAME: This is quite easy:
            ZX81:           Death Canyon (Or anything similar).
            ZX Spectrum 48K:Zoids, Sherlock, CASCADE CASSETTE 50.
             "    "      +3:Vindicator.
            STE:            Black Lamp, Space Harrier, Outrun.
            Arcade:         Thunderblade.

FAVE VIRUS: Fortunately, I have yet to encounter one, but I think 
            anything which is harmless and amusing, but highly 
            complicated, deserves to give the author some credit.  
            Simulated psuedo-random genetic mutation in a virus 
            interests me, but I don't know of anything which meets
            that specification.

FAVE DEMOCREW: TCB (but TLB appear to be the best of the British, at 
               present.) (Lick, sluurp - ZCT)

BEST DEMO: With an STE, I have been deprived of the Cuddly Demos 
           because ZCT tells me that they don't work on it.  From what 
           I've seen, I think that the Union Demo, The Sowatt Demo and 
           (sluurp TLB) The Mindbomb Demo are pretty damn good.  I also 
           have to admit that I did like The Delirious Demo II.

WORST THOUGHT: To be sober for more than 24 hours (aaaargh)
               Seriously though, I agree with Ziggy from OVR in that 
               decapitation can be quite painful, but only if it is 
               performed with a cheese-grater.

BEST THOUGHT: Something erotic involving Lorna and very little 
              clothing.

MOST PROFOUND THOUGHT: Life is but a local variable.

     So, that's it, I can't be bothered to think of any other questions 
to ask myself (I got these questions from TLB) but if anyone would like
to ask me anything, they can contact me via ZCT at the address that he
is supposed to have slipped into Maggie somewhere !  
                                       
                                        J.I.M. from TLL

               writes all of his music on the 1040 STFM at school or 
               on my STE, he has only used an ST for about 24 hours in

     "Oh dear, I've been put on the spot, but never mind, here goes..."
