                                 written by the Maggie Team


"Do you beleive in..."
Edward Hermfield looked up. The moonlight spread through the trees
across Paula's body, sparkling in her eyes and outlining her facial
bone structure and the beauty of her smooth body.
"Do I beleive in what?"
Paula giggled and lay back among the soft moss and cracklin leaves.
Edward advanced on his lover's prostrate body.
"Do you beleive in...in the other side?" Whispered Paula.
"I beleive in your beauty." Said Edward running his hand through
Paulas long silky hair. 

This little introduction was written by one of our new members in 
the Maggie Team, Leon.

As you probably know,  this magazine was finished at the  biggest 
ever ST convention in Holland and these following lyrics by  from 
Tankard  (great German Thrash band) will probably  describe  best 
how we felt before and after the drinks :

PUKE

Drink ! This beer is for my health 
And have a couple more
Drink ! Until the beer is gone 
And pass out on the floor

Puke ! Puke ! In drank too much 
Vomit on the chair
Puke ! Puke ! I drank too much
Even in my hair

Drunk ! The room is spinning
It's turning round
Drunk ! My stomach let me know
As I fell to the ground


Have you ever lived in England ?  No ?  Ah, well, then you do not 
know what kind watery beer they have over hear,  the following is 
what I expect from a German beer:

Chemical Invasion

German beer's among the finest 
The beer is pure and chemical free
A standard set which we are pround of
A standard met by no other land

Purity laws and chemical free
No body pollution - No Change !

Preservatives shall soon be common
And the beer willl be bastardized

Chemical Invasion - Fight for your right to drink pure beer
Chemical Invasion - it's your right the time is here

Make a stand and try to fight it
They'll poison us with import beer
'Cause German beer - it is the purest
And there's no room for chemicals here



Did you ever really want to impress your friends, well here's the 
perfect guide to do so:

1.  Leave unwashed glasses,  and a half empty bottle of expesnive 
champagne tooped up with Pompagne on he coffe table,  and as soon 
as  your friends visit,  hastily clear up,  muttering "that  damn 
Philipino maid !"

2.  A  keyring with over ten keys on it never fails to impress  - 
maybe even a car job (Jaguar),  and whenever you enter the  house 
say loudly - "that damned Philipino maid, I've told her to always 
put the alarm on !"

3.  Many new phones have built in microphones, so at the touch of 
a button you're free to walk around the room,  with your  friends 
voice amplified for everyone to hear. This has a dual purpose:
a) it is extremely intimidating for the caller
b) it is extremely impressive.

4.  Another  great tactic is the answerphone,  especially  if  it 
appears  to  be busy.  This can be achieved by  calling  yourself 
repeatedly  so the light remains flashing constantly,  as  though 
you have countless messages.

5.  A full fridge - this is something gay people rarely have, but 
it  is a sure way of impression friends (the likelyhood  is  they 
won't  have  one  anyway).Re-seal used  cartons  amd  empty  food 
containers  and stack them in the fridge.  When making  beverages 
(lemon- tea) make sure friends catch a glimpse of the full fridge 
- it's all that's needed.

6.  When eating your out suggest sushi. And mention lunch- having 
to be extremely impressive,  combine the two - "took sushi  lunch 
the  other day - it's amazing what those Japanese do with  little 
pieces of fish !"


     The above part was written still in England, whereas all the 
following  text  was written in OSS (some crappy  small  town  in 
Duckland with beautiful girls). After having rampaged through Oss 
the last night we have decided to go to Den Bosch this  night,  I 
think  they want to go to a disco or something of that  kind.  At 
the  moment I am sitting in the room where the Carebears and  the 
Lost  Boys  are  based.  BUT Delta Force have  invaded  our  holy 
territory and NOBODY is even moving a finger.  By the way,  I  am 
extremely hungry because I haven't had any food for 12  hours.  I 
WANT FOOD, LOADSA FOOD ! We just managed to get rid of these guys 
who have even their group name written on the back of the car. 


Have you ever been to Amsterdam ?  No,  then you do not know what 
you  are  missing out on.   The Cd's are as expensive as  in  any 
other shop in the UK if not more. But some of the CDs you can get 
over  there  are forbidden here in the UK because of  teh  brutal 
lyrics and now, just to show you how boring the lyrics are I will 
quote some.

Vacuum Cleaner Love

When I have a lonely weener
I get out my vacuum cleaner
In my closet there she sits
She's got a hole but no tits
Gives a blow job like no other
Then cleans rugs for my mother

 Electrolux  really sucks
 Filter Queen - makes me cream
 Sanitaire - eats me rare
 Black & Decker - chews me pecker

Girls are just a fuckin pain
My vacuum swallows, won't complain
I pump her hose down to the bag
She deep throats but still won't gag
No more cumshots in my eye
Cause my vacuum sucks me dry


This one here was only to warm you up,  if you feel like  puking, 
read the following one:

Afterbirth Casserole

As the  rotting corpse gave birth,
 I moved closer to her hole
I awaited the afterbirth,
 that delicious casserole
That oozing bloody cunt
 that dangling flesh I hoard
That rancid carnage odor
 that tasty imbilical cord

I slurped that chile, I ate the cord
 I swallowed her placenta
I cleaned her cunt  off with my tongue
 all this will content her
Waited nine long months for this meal 
 it made my stomach growl
I've been snacking on ganggreen legs and
 a pus-brown stenching bowel
To speed up my dinner I'll whip out my dick
 and refuck this deseased contortion
Waiting only 9 weeks, I'll reack deep inside
 and devour a human abortion.

Now,  isn't  that  sick  !  Just imagine  having  this  for  your 
breakfast. What else could I talk about ? Currently I am watching 
some strange championship with Schwatzenegger guys, loads muscles 
but  no  brain.  First  they had to pull a  lorry  by  pure  body 
strength. Currently they are lifting rocks weighting about 130 kg 
just like that, it looks pretty amazing, although the guys do not 
look very attractive.  There is this fat guy called OD who  looks 
more or less like a dog and nothing else,  he's a  skinhead,  fat 
like nothing and ehjevkyve, I better won't describe them anymore.


I think that this is all for one of the hidden articles in Maggie 
4, see you in the next hidden article with more dirty lyrics,

               Yours Michael
