
YM2149F is no longer a dirty word!
When  you  first  bought your ST you were stunned  by  the  speed, 
enjoyed the convenience of an internal drive,  liked the  graphics 
but  the sound didn't impress.  Beepety beep beep hardly  makes  a 
great  dance track.  Amiga owners jibed ST owners with  taunts  of 
'tin can sound' or 'speccy soundchip'.
We laughed at Amigas when they crashed, their disk drive burped or 
their  interlace mode flickered non stop.  But one thing  we  were 
envious was that four voice FM soundchip that could play all  that 
great sampled music.
The  first good music program to hit the ST market was Quartet  by 
Rob Povey.  The sound quality of the music was good - 16 Khz - but 
the  actual program was quite awkward to use.  The results of  the 
musical compositions were unparelled on the ST market.
Then  came  ST Connexions with their  amazing  Soundtracker  which 
allowed you to play Amiga sound modules at a frequency of 28Khz. A 
huge  archive of modules could now be played through the  YM2149F. 
What  the Amiga did with dedicated hardware (Known to its  friends 
as Paula) the ST did with some well programmed software.
ST  owners  rejoiced  at  this breakthrough  and  there  was  much 
merriment, much dancing in the streets and much drinking of wine.
The  floodgates opened and out popped soundtrackers from  Equinox, 
The Empire and An Cool.
But which is the best? Lets find out!
Welcome to

INTERGALACTIC SOUNDTRACKER MUD WRESTLING
Let the battle commence:

ST CONNEXIONS SOUND TRACKER NUMBER 1
Le crew du France ave produced une excellent demo moi thinks.
This is really more of a demo than a soundtracker. 
On loading you are presented with a small demo with an ST CNX logo 
in the middle of the screen and dual scrolline,  one in French and 
one in English.  The music is standard soundchip by Joky Jochen  I 
think.
Press space and you enter the main 'soundtracker'.  This  consists 
of  two  screens,  one with some nice volume bars  and  the  other 
telling you who composed all the Music.
Pressing  keys  F1-F9 loads up the seperate  modules  and  they're 
pretty damn good modules.  They include compositions by Megaforce, 
Rebels,  Enemies and other Amiga crews who can't code but sure can 
write music.  My favourite modules are Jean Michelle Jarre and Alf 
- I love the laugh.
By  pressing  F10  you can load other modules  by  typing  in  the 
filename giving this demo a certain degree of flexibility.
As  demo this is brilliant - the music quality is great and  there 
is enough variety on it to keep you listening for an hour or two.
As  a  'Soundtracker' it isn't much cop.  for a  start  you  can't 
compose anything - there are no tools which allow you to make your 
own modules. So no points in this category.
one of the main ideas behind soundtracker was that you could build 
a  collection  of  modules  which  you  could  back  through  your 
soundtracker.  It was like the concept of playing tapes through  a 
tape player.
Unfortunately this function isn't very well implemented on the  ST 
CNX  soundtracker.  When  you want to load a new  module  you  are 
presented with any form of file selector,  you have to type in the 
filename of the module.  There is a problem with this,  unless you 
have  an  amazing  memory you are hardly  going  to  remember  the 
filename of every module on all your disks so you have to quit the 
program,  write  down  the filename of the module and  reload  the 
program. Shit design really.
Overall   this  is  more  of  a  'wow  look  we've  just  made   a 
soundtracker!'  demo  than  a  module  creator  or  player.  As  a 
standalone  program its find,  but it really is a pain to  use  in 
conjuction with other soundtracker modules.
 
ST CONNEXIONS .MOD PLAYER
This is the second soundtracker demo from that great french crew.
This is different to the Sound Demo number 1 in two ways:
1) It isn't as good
2) Its better
It  isn't  as good as it hasn't got as many modules as  the  first 
demo  and  their not as easy to select and there  isn't  an  intro 
demo.
Its  better  because  it  tells the name of  the  module  that  is 
currently playing, you can't output through the sound thropugh the 
soundchip,  replay  cartridge or MV 16 cartridge.  It also  has  a 
scrolline so you don't get bored just watching volume  bars.  This 
scrolline  tells  us that sound quality  has  been  improved,  the 
routines  are neater coded,  the soundtracker is  100%  compatible 
with all Amiga modules. The worst thing about the scroller is that 
it doesn't greet the Lost Boys.
Also on this disk are five modules, and they're all rather juicy.
In  a folder there is the sourcecode for soundtrackers at  various 
frequencies:
10Khz, 16Khz, 22Khz, 26Khz and Amiga
Various useful for all you coders out there!
The  soundtracker  itself is a pain in the  bum.  ST  CNX  haven't 
learnt  since their first Soundtracker and the module selector  is 
awful.  You have to remember the filename of every MOD and type it 
exactly right.  If your want to quit the program, you have to type 
YEAH.  Weird. After you've heard one module and you press a key to 
return  to the module selector,  the program locks up.  You  can't 
type in another module name,  you can't type anything.  Very  poor 
indeed.

NOISETRAKCER
The Empire strikes back with this brilliant soundtracker, the best 
thing about it is that its PD!
On the disk comes two programs, a creator and player.
The player is quite simple,  on loading you are presented with the 
standard  GEM fileselector from which to pick  your  module.  This 
seems  unoriginal  but  it  is the best  way  to  load  a  module, 
especially if you've got them stored in a subdirectory somewhere.
once the module has loaded you are presented with the mani  screen 
and rather weedy it is too.  Four feeble red (No colour change  at 
the top) volume bars bounce up and down to the song. On the top of 
the screen are some blue bars that overscan into the borders. This 
isn't that impressive as the left border flickers  awfully.  Worse 
than Manikin's screens on Mindbomb!
Excuse me New Kids On The Block,  'this ones for the children  has 
just come on the radio'.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggggggggg
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Smash! Tinkle! Sound of radio flying out of window.
Sorry about that. Now where was I? Ah yes...
This player gives you the choice of four different outputs through 
which you can dump your music:
YM2149 - Through that lovely soundchip inside your ST
Prosound Designer - Through the sound sampler's cartridge.
MV 16 cartridge - I think this is that rather natty cartridge  you 
                  get with BAT.
ST-Replay - Through the famous sound sampler's cartridge.
The choice is yours!

On  loading  the creation part of noisetracker you are  given  the 
option of looking through a series of help documents.  As they are 
all written in French this isn't very helpful.
Noisetracker allows to load samples of instruments and record them 
onto  a  file  using  the ST's keyboard  as  a  3  octave  musical 
instrument. It gives such functions as cutting and pasting blocks, 
repeating patterns etc. all fairly simple but extremely useful.
Using  Noisetracker  there  is  no reason  why  you  can't  create 
competent modules,  it's like 1st Word adaquate,  and if you don't 
need any advanced functions, completely useable.
There are a few bugs,  it rarely crashes but the tempo of  modules 
seems to vary depending what mood Noisetracker is in, sometimes it 
plays them too fast, sometimes too slow.
Noisetracker  is  an excellent program as anyone  who  has  bought 
MAGGIE  3  will know.  It offers exemplorary value for  money  and 
allows  you to create music only dreamed of in the early  days  of 
the ST.

EQUINOX SOUNDTRACKER
Not much to this one I'm afraid, just two screens.
One  is a module selector and Checksum has got the right  idea  of 
what a module selector is.  It displays all the modules on a disk, 
using cursor keys and return you can select the  module.  Pressing 
escape will make a new directory.
The main screen consists of a big Equinox logo drawn by minute man 
and a four volume bars.  At the bottom of the screen it tells  you 
which module is currently playing.

TCB TRACKER
This  is  in a lot of ways the odd one out.  It  is  a  commercial 
release and isn't and 'Amiga' soundtracker in the sense you  can't 
load all Amiga modules directly into it.
When  An Cool wrote the TCB Tracker he wasn't trying to  create  a 
program that would give you brilliant music quality, but something 
that  would  use  very  little  proccesssor  time  so  you   could 
incorporate it into your demos and games. 
TCB  Tracker only uses frequencies of only 10Khz  max.  It  mainly 
uses the frequncy of 8.3Khz - The frequency that Amigas  use.  Get 
this, all ST soundtrackers use higher frequncy than the Amiga! Haw 
haw!  The  music can be made very loud,  and the sound quality  is 
good.
What makes the TCB Tracker stand head and shoulders above the rest 
is  its vast array of functions.  I'll go briefly through some  of 
them:    load   or   save   module/sample/song,    change   drive,  
Play/Stop/Record,  Turn on and off channels 1,2,3 and 4,  move  up 
and down pattern using mouse,  help, change frequency (8.3 or 10), 
drum machine-assign different instruments to different keys, MIDI-
enter  notes using an external MIDI keyboard,  disk info-how  many 
bytes  are left,  clear song,  clear samples,  clear  all,  change 
volume (loud/soft), insert/delete/find pattern, monitor samples at 
current step,  cycle pattern,  mute special effects, change volume 
of samples,  transpose,  loop, tune drums, create special effects, 
cut/past/overlay/underlay/stretch/reverse  track,   cut/paste/copy 
track, cut/paste block, transpose/cut/replace special sample.
Phew!  As  you can see you can really manipulate samples sith  the 
greatest of ease. It is also easy for you to incorporate them into 
your  program,  on  the disk are routines which will  outplay  TCB 
Tracker music through your favourite programming language:
GFA Basic, Assember, STOS etc.
The  STOS routines are,  to put it  bluntly,  crap.  Although  TCB 
Tracker only takes up a small amount of proccessor time,  in  STOS 
you can't play music and move sprites!  Useless or what! And it is 
very  unreliable,  crashing all the time.  I feel like I  own  and 
Amiga  while  I'm trying to put TCB Tracker music into  my  latest 
game! 
Another  letdown  on  the TCB Tracker is the  MIDI  keyboard  note 
entry.  It  is very unresponsive.  You press a key and five  yours 
later  the program acknowledges this.  When you click on the  MIDI 
icon, contary to what the manual says, you can't enter MIDI notes, 
you can only do this when its deselected.  It is also incompatible 
with some keyboards.
The  TCB Tracker has quite a few bugs,  its not as bug  ridden  as 
kick  off but it isn't as clean as it should be.  If you move  the 
mouse  when a module is saving or loading then the  program  locks 
up.  This  has happened to me even on version 1.1 and it  is  very 
annoying to say the least.
Another  disappointment  is the fact that it can't  directly  load 
Amiga  modules.  On version 1.1 there is a convert  program  which 
allows you to convert Amiga format modules to TCB Tracker  format. 
The  problem  is the problem is structured so that  it  loads  the 
whole module,  converts it in memory then saves it so you need one 
meg  of  memory to do this successfully.  Also it is  annoying  to 
waste disk space with two versions of the same module.
One  thing that puzzles me is the demo at the start.  Its  a  good 
demo  with  hardware scrolling and some  smooth  sprites,  but  it 
doesn't use TCB Tracker music,  it uses standard soundchip  music. 
If the TCB Tracker is so good for demos, why didn't An Cool use it 
in this one?
Apart  from  these  criticisms,  the TCB Tracker is  a  very  good 
program.  At œ39.95 it is a tad overpriced - but An Cool  deserves 
this money for all the work he has done on the ST demo scene.
Anders  is  a  very talented programmer and he has  made  a  great 
program.  I  feel if he'd spent a bit more time with it  it  could 
have been awesome not just great. Direct loading of Amiga modules, 
the  ability  to use various frequencies say  16,  22  and  28Khz, 
better MIDI support and bugs ironed out and would be an  essential 
buy for every ST owner.
It is worth buying, and I can't wait for some new versions with no 
bugs! I'm fed up with An Cool being too busy 'going to university' 
to  code.  Why he needs to go to university is beyond  me!  He  is 
wasted  their.  He is a brilliantly talented programmer who  could 
get a job anywhere and I bet software companies are crying out for 
him!
TCB  Tracker is good is you want to incorporate it in  your  demos 
and  games.  MPH  tell  me they've got the routines  down  to  12% 
processor time on an STFM and 2% on an STE,  so there is no reason 
why  a good game can't run smoothly with the remaining  proccessor 
title. 
Buy this if your a programmer.

FIGHT RESULT
All  the  above programs are great proving just what can  be  done 
with a shit soundchip if you can code.
My overall ratings:
ST  CNX  SOUND  DEMO  -  This is  great  as  demo,  no  use  as  a 
soundtracker.
ST  CNX .MOD PLAYER - Forget it.  Nice mods but the player is  too 
awkard  to  use and hasn't got the functions of  the  Noisetracker 
player.
EQUINOX - This is just a module player, and it serves this purpose 
very well.
NOISETRACKER - Brilliant. The mod player is great. The creator has 
all the functions most musician will ever need. 
TCB  TRACKER - Millions of functions you don't  need,  it  doesn't 
include a handful of functions you do need.   If you have money to 
burn and you don't mind the hassle of converting all your MODs  to 
TCB Tracker format, go for this one.

So  which one should you buy?  My advice,  get  Noisetracker,  its 
packed with peanuts and its very chewy!!!
