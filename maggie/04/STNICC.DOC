
                    THE STNICC CONVENTION 
                              Attented to by Michael Schuessler

     First  of  all  I  think that  I  should  explain  what  the 
abbreviation at the top stands for.  Have you ever heard of  this 
other great disc magazine called ST NEWS ? Well, the producers of 
this magazine are the people who have organized this  convention, 
so   therefore  it  is  called  ST  NEWS   International   Coding 
Conference. This meeting was the biggest computer convention ever 
in  the  history of the Atari ST.  About a  hundred  people  were 
invited  most  of which showed up.  Occasionally  some  uninvited 
guests arrived who were also allowed in as long as they paid  the 
entry fee. 

     This convention was no hackers meeting as Richard Karsmakers 
(author  of  ST News) kept on repeating throughout  the  4  days. 
Therefore  there was no hacker invited and no hacker  came.  Only 
demo coders,  game authors and journalists from various magazines 
came.  Some famous game coders like Jeff Minter were also invited 
but  it turned out that he did not have enough money to  come  in 
the end (what a shame cause he is a nice guy).  

     The  convention started on the Friday before X-Mas  and  the 
various crews kept on coming in throughout the entire  day.  When 
the evening came up, the catering service arrived and we were all 
presented with some nice food. Stefan Posthuma (another author of 
ST NEWS) also had organised drinks (non alcoholic).  All in all I 
think  there were about 200 litres of not more of coke  of  which 
was nothing left at the end of the convention.  Stefan's boss was 
so nice to give Stefan the office for the 4 days. This office was 
the  perfect place to hold such a convention although  it  turned 
out  to be slightly over-crowded at night when everybody  cramped 
themselves out on the floor in order to get at least some sleep. 

     To  mention  some  of  the crews  who  attended  this  great 
convention, here we go: 
From  England:  The Lost Boys,  Dynamic Duo,  The  Watchmen,  Rob 
                Povey (author of Quartet),  MPH (he's writing the 
                article for ST Format)
From Sweden  :  The Carebears, Omega, Sync
From Germany :  Delta Force,  TEX, Thalion, German Alliance, The 
                Garlic Eaters
From France  :  Overlanders, NeXT, ST Connexion, Legacy
From Switzerland: The Cooperation
From Luxembourg : Unlimited Matrix
From Holland: Aenigmatica, ST News, Galtan 6

     This were only some of the more famous crews,  not to forget 
to mention the odd Lamer hanging about. 

     On the invitation you were told that there will be a graffix 
competition,  3  1/2 K competition,  a demo competition and  many 
other things,  they also reminded you not to forget you  swimming 
trunks.  

The Graffix Competition:
Gogo  of  the  Carebears drew a fantastic picture  on  the  Amiga 
featuring a man on a horse. 
Spaz  of TLB and somebody else got second with a nice picture  of 
an Obituary Album Cover.
I do not know anything about the others as I wasn't there anymore 
when  the prized were given.  I just know that Dogue de Move  got 
7th with a really funny picture (there were only 7 entries).

The 3 1/2 K Competition:
In  this  competition you program was not allowed to  exceed  the 
given  length if packed or unpacked.  This part was won by  DELTA 
FORCE who coded an entire game is about one day (marvellous piece 
of work).  

Demo Screen Competition:
As  there weren't too many entries it was no great deal  for  The 
Lost  Boys  to win.  This winning screen can be seen in  the  ULM 
Megademo  which will be reviewed incedently in the next issue  of 
maggie. 

    Throughout the days people did coding,  playing games, worked 
on  their product or just walked around in order to meet  people. 
In  order to have a wash most of us went to the swimming pool  on 
the  Saturday where we then stayed for about one hour.  It was  a 
great  laugh going down the slide.  Have you ever tried to  stick 
Es's head under water ?  Well,  don't try,  he is definitely  too 
strong, he should take suomi, this Chinese Wrestling sport !

     On  the  Sunday around lunch-time the first  people  started 
to  leave again for good old home,  the first one's were in  fact 
some  of the Carebears who travelled here by train and had to  be 
back  in  time  for their X-mas on the 24th of  December  in  the 
evening.  I had to leave too as I had to be back for my X-Mas. 

     2 Mega demos were also released at this computer convention, 
First of all there was the European Demos and then there was  the 
Syntax  Terror  demo,  both groups worked  frantically  on  their 
products,  they both even managed to release them.  Great  stuff, 
Overlanders and Delta Force.  The ULM Megademo and Maggie Issue 4 
should  have been released there,  but do to errors in  the  code 
this was not possible.
