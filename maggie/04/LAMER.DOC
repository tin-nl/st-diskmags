 < AN IDIOTS GUIDE TO LAMER SPOTTING BY -ZCT- (TLL) >
 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

LAMER : A person who spends most of his time pretending to know 
a lot about a given subject esp. Computing.  A lamer likes to 
keep company with people who are very stupid so that they 
themselves can seem knowledgeable.  LAMERS (plural of lamer) 
like to work in computer shops where they can give "advice" to 
ignorant people.  This advice is ofter refered to colloquially 
as bullshit.  It is important to note the difference between a
LAMER and a person who is IGNORANT.  Ignorant people know 
nothing and admit to their short commings.  Lamers pretend to 
know everything.

Since I have met one of the biggest lamers in the world (I.E. 
ANDREW BOWD) I consider myself quite well qualified to write an 
artical on LAMERS.  

It is very important that you spot lamers before they spot you. 
It is very bad for your image to be seen talking to or being 
nice to LAMERS.

OK down to business.

The questionaire below will tell you whether or not you are a 
LAMER.  You should also try this questionaire out on all your 
friends to ensure they are not LAME.

Write down the answers to the questions and then work out your total 
mark from the table at the bottom.  NO CHEATING !!!

Okay, time to mark your work !!!

You should have a list of ten numbers with a letter by each.
Use the table below to work out your score.

1) a=1 b=3 c=5       6) a=1 b=5 c=3 
2) a=3 b=1 c=5       7) a=1 b=5 c=3
3) a=5 b=1 c=5       8) a=5 b=1 c=5
4) a=5 b=1 c=1       9) a=1 b=5 c=5
5) a=5 b=1 c=3      10) a=3 b=5 c=1

Right, this is the assessment of your score :

less than 10 : You are a complete lamer, this score is probably 
               the same as your IQ.  Perhaps you should join 
               Andrew Bowd's new crew.

10-14 : You're a cool dude, you're no lamer: CONTACT US !!!

15-19 : Not too bad, you'll soon learn.

20-29 : Be careful, you might be called a LAMER with a score 
        like this.

30-39 : You are a complete LAMER perhaps you should sell your 
        ST and buy an AMIGA.

40-49 : Sorry but you are so LAME you really ought to send all 
your money and computer equipment to THE LOWER LEVEL and go and 
see if you can swim across the River Thames in London with a 
brick tied around your neck.

50 or more : Suicide is probably the only solution !!!

THE LOWER LEVEL have started a LAMER re-abilitation centre 
where LAMERS are put in touch with each other and can discuss 
their problems and ways to overcome them.  To join simply send 
your name and address to us with a cheque for œ500 payable to 
C.J.Healey.  You will get a tee-shirt and badge with the slogan :
"I'M NOT REALLY A COMPLETE LAMER".  We will also put you in touch 
with other LAMERS and send you a book called "HOW NOT TO BE A LAMER".

Seriously though, if you are NOT a LAMER then contact us :

CHELTENHAM,
