Those  of  you who read the Sci-fi publication  2000AD  will  know 
straightaway  about this gentleman,  genetically engineered,  blue 
skinned and exceedingly lethal infantryman...

You will also know he is the last of his kind,  his collegues,  an 
entire  regiments worth,  having been wiped out at the Quartz Zone 
massacre as a result of a leak by a traitor general,  (Information 
leak that is,  not anything else...) and now Rogue,  with the help 
of his three bio-chipped buddies,  Helm,  Gunnar,  and Bagman have 
vowed to bring the traitor to justice...

After several adventures in 2000AD, Rogue finally succeeded in his 
goal  of  despatching said T.G.  he then went on to  several  more 
adventures,  and has recently re-emerged in the new-look, revamped 
200AD in full colour,  as an enigmatic and airbrushed figure, more 
adventures are planned in the near future....

On  to  the game,  Krysalis picked up the licence for this,  which 
concentrates on the earlier incarnation of Rogue Trooper,  and his 
hunt for the Traitor General. People with long memories, and a C64 
or  Spectrum,  may  well  remember an earlier  effort,  which  was 
considered  as  not  up to much...  How does  the  latest  silicon 
interpretation of Rogue Trooper compare ?.....

You  are  started off as a prisoner of the Norts  (Northern  army) 
inside an installation that bears some resemblance to Sellafields, 
with  all sorts of radioactive gunge dribbling down the walls  and 
oozing out of pipes.  You have the job of rescuing your three bio-
chipped  buddies from the complex,  and as you start off  unarmed, 
pick up some hardware at the same time...

Before  you can say 'Oh damn,  I've opened the wrong valve and let 
1500  tonnes of radioactive sludge out into the Irish  Sea..'  you 
are beset by everything the Norts can throw at you... You progress 
from  kicking robot guards with your bare feet,  to obtaining  the 
use  of Gunnar,  who is bio-chipped into your rifle,  to deal with 
Nort  infantrymen who are also shooting at you,  via picking up  a 
knife  (USE  - opening tins and people!) The idea is  to  progress 
through the complex to rescue all three bio-chips.... 

The next stage involves a Space-Harrier type flight, with suitable 
enemy craft to duff over....(I actually got to fiddle with this at 
the appalling CES Show in Sept of this year - Do you remember when 
computer  shows were great fun,  and at Olympia???) You then go on 
to  survive  a  dreamgas attack and try to  contact  Souther  high 
command.....

To  play,  it  leads you in gently,  electrified floors apart!  you 
soon find out what the switches on the wall do...  It is very much 
a  platform job on the first level,  with the usual  platform-type 
puzzles,  where  to  find switches to open doors,  useful  objects 
etc..  Graphically,  it  is  competant,  a  very  good  futuristic 
atmosphere  of  a  broken down military  installation,  the  Rogue 
sprite  being  recognisable,  as well as the Nort guards and  other 
objects...  One stage has you playing in the dark and using infra-
red vision (Which is where things got rather tough for me..)

The bottom panel gives the usual info, current score, weapon used, 
state  of  health  etc,  which is shown by a lovely  bleeding  and 
smashed-up face...  (The sort of face you see in the rougher parts 
of  town on a friday night!!) Also not forgetting the  comic-style 
intro  and  finishing sequences which seem to be lifted  from  the 
pages  of  2000AD.  The second part of the game,  is a  reasonable 
facsimile  of a Space-Harrier onward shoot-em-up,  with  chequered 
scrolling ground, rows of parallax clouds in the sky, mountains in 
the background etc....

Generally this is a reasonable interpretation of a tricky licence, 
involving a pot-pourri of game styles (Now where have I heard that 
before?)  and  it is not too bad on the playability  side,  as  it 
unfolds  a slowly developing plot...  I would have reservations as 
to  its  success,  outside  of fans of Rogue  Trooper  and  2000AD 
though,  as  it  is one of many,  many similar games,  and it will 
suffer  in comparison with the big name licences in the run-up  to 
Christmas, which is a shame, but there you go.....

ANUVVA ONE BITES THE DUST HAHAHAHAHAHAHA...................
