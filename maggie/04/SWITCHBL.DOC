SWITCHBLADE REVIEW
By Leon O'Reilly

On the cyber world of Thraxx, Havok has returned.
After 10,000 years of peace, the Fireblade, the source of power
for the ancient Bladeknights has shattered.
The night burned red, and the people of the Undercity fell 
beneath the onslaught of Havok's nightmare creations.
Helpless, the Bladeknights dided alongside their people. Only one
of their order survived.
Guess who that is?
Yep, you are Hiro, the last of the Bladeknights.
You must guide Hiro through the Undercity and find 16 fragments
of the shattered fireblade. with this you must defeat Havok.

This game is basically a platform and ladders flip screen beat 'em
up. The way you tackle meanies is quite original.
You have a combat power meter, and the longer you hold down fire,
the more power you will sum up. When you let go of fire you unleash
all this power. You will perform a different action depending on
where the bar has reached when you let go of fire.
If you tap fire, you will throw a punch. (Blam!) 
If you hold down fire until the combat meter reaches the middle
you will do a high kick. (Thud!)
If you charge up to full combat power you will do a low 'sweeping'
kick. (Sweep!)
Your body is a dangerous weapon, but its range is limited.
Fortunately you can pick up weapons which you can hurl at the 
bad guys. These weapons are:
BLADE - Combat power determines range of this weapon 
SCORCHBALL - Very powerfull, only stops when it hits a wall
DART - Limited range. Useful for playing Bullseye with. (Smashing!)
SPINBLADE - Combat meter determines the speed of this weapon
NEEDLE BOLTS - Combat meter determines the number of bolts thrown
TRISPIKE - This weapon has unlimited range (Pretty handy eh?)
FIREBLADE - This weapon has unlimited range and is the most powrful
            in the whole game. (Blah, blah, blah)
As you can see the combat meter is used all the time and mastering
it is the secret to the game. You'll need to be good at it when 
facing such obstacles and ghastly creatures as these:
FLAMES - Quite hot.
SPIKES - When you come near, out they pop.
BLADEBALLS - Balls with blades.(Not really?)
SPIKELICE - Little white things that jump in your hair. OK, they're
            annoying gits that crawl about and have to be sweepingly
            kicked.
CYBATS - Deadly flying creatures. (Tweet.)
MANSNAKES - Instead of legs they have a tail. These guys are easy to
            kill.
SPIDORBS - These robot guards love climbing walls. (Don't you?)
CRESTHEDS - Futurstic punks, they take a few hits before they die.
REPTILONS - Tuff guys that look uglier than Douglas Hurd (If thats 
            possible)
SCORPODS - Even more annoying than Spikelice, these creatures have
           a sting in their tail. (No, not the singer)
FLAMEHOGS - Nigel Lawson sized blubbaguys.
KOBRAS - Worms in sunglasses, or as the manual says:
         "Merciless robot snakes with venomous hyodermic fangs".Ouch.
STRIDERS - I haven't come across these chaps yet but I guess they'll
           be ugly, fat, tuff, robotic and have a hairstyle like one
           of the Stone Roses.
RAZORBS - I wonder what these will look like.

     Not only are there these regular guys, but Gremlin have come
up with a really original idea. At the end of each level they've
put a BIG bad guy whom you have to kill to progress? What a good
idea. It's good to see us Brits are coming up with innovative ideas
for games these days and not just copying other people.
On each level there is a 'Boss' enemy.
Level 1 - Giant Spikelouse
Unless you're Duncan Goodhew your going to have to get this git
out of your hair.
Level 2 - Giant scorpoid
A big scorpion, and when I say big I mean the size of the ex-chancellor
of the excheqor.
Level 3 - Giant Cybat
Big, bad, batty and blind (Almost).
Level 4 - Giant Roborgasm, oops, Roborganism
Can robots have orgasms? I don't know as I haven't got to level 4 yet.
Level 5 - Havok
The meany to end all meanies. He is so mean he wouldn't lend you
2p to feed the life-support-system that is keeping your poorly
granny alive.

INTRODUCTION
This game doesn't appear to have a loading screen. Once it's 
loaded some sprites zoom into the middle of screen to form
the 'SWITCHBLAD' logo.
After this you see some nice cartoon like stills giving you
the story. Go past these and your in the game.

GAMEPLAY
Well whats the game actually like? It's similar to CORE's previous
game Rick Dangerous, but more flexible and not quite as good.
It is similar to Ranarama in the way it only displays a room when you've
been into it. There are many passages and rooms to explore, as well
as lots of hidden rooms - some blocks can be kicked allowing you
access to more rooms.
Creatures appear in every room, but once you've killed them they
don't come, which my opinion is a good thing.
There are many bonuses scattered about and collection the fragments
of the switchblade is quite easy, though some pieces require accurate
jumping.

GRAPHICS & SOUND
The graphics are very good in a cartoonish style, though they tend
to get a bit repetitive, on part of the Undercity is very like
another. Sound is standard soundchip music with a suitable tune
written by Ben Dalglish. Its not up to Mad Max standard but its good
and you don't tire of it.

OVERALL
Switchblade is a good little game which if you see going cheap may 
be worth buying. If you liked old 8-Bit platform games you should
like this. Unlike Rick Dangerous, this isn't a classic. Secret passages
and hidden rooms add interest but it does get monotonous. You will
get some hours of enjoyment from this game, but don't expect to be still
playing 6 months later.
