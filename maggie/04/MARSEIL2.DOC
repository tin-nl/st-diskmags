
Hullo?

Er, is this the Marseille Real-time article?....I'm too 
late?....Sh*t!!.... well, I would want to add a few things to the crap we 
said in that article, so here goes:

Because the Dutch and English postal services cannot achieve the speed 
this text has to attain to reach Maggy in time, it will be sent via modem 
along the even more untrustworthy Dutch and English telephone network. So 
if you see some garblœ&*%xx&œ(//(!# (damn, already?) then it's their 
fault!!!!!!!!! <<- Is it a bird? Is it a plane? NO! It's... PACKMAN!

Interruption #... well mmmmmm one of the many....
definition of a lamer:

A lamer is a guy/girl who spells Email backwards AND wrong!
Or alternatively someone who uses a picture as a screensaver...

The journey back from Marseille to Holland was less eventful than the
one the other way. Lots of stopping for food & drink, missing of turns 
in Paris (what DO you want? All signs are SO dirty there), an expressway
flooded, and the unexplainable time in which we did France->Holland 
(because we didn't go over the speed limit, did we?)

Something else: on the way TO Marseille, we (Crush, ZoKathRa and I) got a 
little bored, so we went to watch the cars we passed:

WE GREET THE OWNERS OF THE FOLLOWING CARS:

For the pleasure they gave us, by having GEORGEOUS women aboard.
AXL-070 (Belgian)

Because it reminded us of a very good piece of music (try it: 70 is the 
ASCII-code for 'F'!! so it reads AXL-F!!! WE REALLY SAW IT!)
VS-E-812 (German)

For carrying a pretty siamese cat.
7138-XW-77 (French)

everybody reading this text, and as we Nutty Snakes say:

Final remark from Crush: "I have to say from TNS that Sammy Joe must 
remember the Dot demo. If he can't recollect what it is then ask Phil."

Second final remark from Crush: "Hey, Snake, what did you do to my bottle 
of rum? It was gone in no time..."

Last final remark from Crush: "Well, no more final remarks (I hope)".

So, that's it, there's no more. Stop reading.

Crush here (yes, again). We must make sure this text will fit on this 
disk, so here it is:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
So, now there won't be any disk-space trouble.
