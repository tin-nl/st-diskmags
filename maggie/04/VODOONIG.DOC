Anuvva CIH review......

'Boots'  Barker  is really an unlucky sod,  sadistic  parents  who 
stuck such a stupid name on him,  his fiance who has gone off with 
his best friend, after thoughtfully pushing him out of the balloon 
that they were in at the time over the African jungle. Oh yes, the 
jungle,  which  has  a witchdoctor who has jammed  this  ludicrous 
voodoo mask over his head and upper torso, so he looks like one of 
the  WEETABIX (TM) Skinheads..  If you bear in mind that he has  a 
pair  of  denims and Doc Martens boots,  then you start  seriously 
wondering  where  Zippo  Games  got the  idea  for  their  central 
character from??????

(NB.   Both   WEETABIX   and   DOC   MARTENS   BOOTS   are made in 
NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, where I live... Hooray!!!! )

Having  only  partaken of a titchy breakfast,  'Boots has  to  get 
eight  pins to stick into his witchdoctor doll,  by roaming around 
the  jungle,  entering five different temples in order to  collect 
the  gems,  and  also to complete three special missions  for  the 
other pins. Only then can you attempt to confront the witchdoctor.

The  game  is  done  in  the  best  traditions  of  isometric  3-D 
adventures,  and  is  huge,  there  being (apparently) around  500 
screens  for  the jungle,  each of the five temples has  about  50 
screens  each,  and there is also the witchdoctors lair,  which is 
large  as well...  (I did not count them myself..) Which makes for 
one enormous game.  Fortunately you can save your current position 
to  disk,  as this is another game which won't be completed in one 
sitting.. (Unless you are bonkers or something..)

On  the way,  you can enter shops and casinos,  to buy extra items 
and  weapons,  and  hopefully  increase  your  holdings  of  money 
(fruit).  But  you  start off with your D.M's as the only  weapon, 
killing things by jumping on them......

Graphically  nicely  done,  with plenty of varied scenery  in  the 
jungle,  giving  way  to  more abstract  and  slightly  repetitive 
scenery  in  the temples,  the large amount of low jungle  foilage 
tends  to obscure your character as he is confined to  narrow  and 
tricky winding pathways,  at the same time there are various nasty 
spiders, snakes and other beasties you either have to avoid or jump 
on.  There is also a 'night and day' in this game, night falls, it 
becomes quite dark, but at the same time, the beasties go away...

Sonically,  soundchip  title  tune,  (Soundchip in 'eerie' mode..) 
which continues into the game with slight spot effects..

The really funny part of the game concerns the controls, these are 
a  pig  and  a pain...  The joystick has been programmed  to  give 
diagonal left/right and has been rotated 45 degrees. Combined with 
the visibility problem in some parts of the jungle,  this can lead 
to  serious trouble with any nasties that you are having  to  jump 
on,  and  doing this is a matter of trial and error..  I might add 
that  the  problem is not so bad in the temple,  as there is  less 
activity on the ground, and more time to consider your position..

Playing in the temples is less action,  and more puzzling out,  as 
you have to collect the gems from what are apparently inaccessible 
rooms,  here  you  find hidden entrances and teleport pads to  get 
around....

Ratings time........

GRAPHIX:-  81%  -  Bright and well drawn  Ultimatesque  graphics, 
elements  of SABRE WULF and KNIGHTLORE here (HELP!  I'm showing  my 
age!!)

SONIX:- 65% - Soundchipped tune which sounds reasonable,  but goes 
on, and on, and on, and on........... Usual spot effects (A packet 
of  the  usual spot effects please Mr Patel,  and twenty  Rothmans 
as well....)

PLAYABILITY:-  72% - Control system comes as a surprise to  people 
who  are used to going in the direction they move their  joystick, 
but  I think it can be mastered in time,  difficulty level is  not 
too hard either...

OVERALL:-  78% - I would recommend this to fans of the genre,  and 
people  who  have lots of time on their hands for what is  a  very 
large  game......  Also for people with infinite lifespans and the  
patience to go with it.
