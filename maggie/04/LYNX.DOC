 It's here at last!!!! The reason for me buying my Lynx....

I'll assume that you know what Klax is about, as I only reviewed 
it last issue. So to keep this review short I will only tell you 
about the differences between the ST version and the Lynx one.

 For a start, the tiles that came down on the ST version were 
preset, so you could remember the order and think ahead, but on 
the Lynx the tiles are choosen randomly, so it's impossible to 
remember them. 
 
 Also on the Lynx version all the sound effects are sampled (very
clearly) from the arcade version, a womans voice anounces every 
level and also starts to get a bit excited when you get multiple 
Klaxes and starts saying "ooooh" "aaaaaah" "wooooooo" and "yeah!".
The music on the title screen (which isn't sampled) is excellent, 
the best I've heard on the Lynx.
 
 The actual game is played in the same position as gauntlet (long
ways) this really looks good as the tile ramp becomes long (like 
the arcade one). The graphics are superb and very nicely drawn, the
background are detailed and imaginative. The intro is nice as well, 
it features a hand doing the Klax movement (sign language, spelling
out KLAX, and then moving to the "K" hand shape) and lot of zoomed 
graphics.

 I don't really know what else to say, as the gameplay is just as 
good as the arcade one.

At this point I must say thank to to COMPUTER VISIONS for letting
me have all these games at trade price (much cheaper, otherwise I 
wouldn't be able to afford them all!), and so if you want any Lynx
games (fast, they do 1st class postage, same day dispatch, and if 
something is not in stock, they can get it withing 24 hours.)

As Disk Maggie does appear to be continuing now (you might have 
noticed the last issue was a little late!) and the fact that
nobody writes any lynx reviews for Maggie, I thought I had better
get off my butt and do some more. Right, so due to a wonderful flow
of money I've just had, I can review 3 new games, Todd's Adventures
In Slime World, Klax, and Roadblasters.

TODD'S ADVENTURES IN SLIME WORLD.
---------------------------------
 You are Todd, a bold and nearly fearless galactic explorer, and
you like nothing better than planets full of weird and dangerous
creatures. On an exploration mission in the Andromeda sector, you 
discover a mysterious drifting starship. You board the deserted 
ship, and retrieve part of the captains log.

 The log discribes slime world, a planet teeming with slimey, 
gooey, disgusting life forms. You only have the first section of 
each date's entry, so the information is maddeningly incomplete.
But when you reach the first reference to valuable slime gems, you
immediately order the android copilot to set course for slime 
world...

 Slime World, is a sort of arcade adventure type game, the game 
contains a number of selectable "plots" they have different themes
and range from straight arcade blasting to highly logical puzzles
(captain). After selecting the plot you wish to play, you are 
presented with a very, very nice intro to that adventure, a large 
spaceship flys down through the atmosphere and crashes of the 
planets surface, Todd jumps out and starts walking along the 
ground (which is nicely done with lodsa levels of parallax 
scrolling) he finds a hole in the ground and climbs down into it.

 The basic aim of all the games is to collect slime gems, for each 
slime gem collected you are given a set number of points. You must
also try to clean up slime world by killing the inhabitance with 
your water pistol. When the aliens explode they release droplets 
of slime that fly off in all directions, getting hit by the slime
starts to turn you green, the greener yo get, the deader(?) you get,
until you explode. This works for all slime, slime will drop from 
the ceiling and there are also pools of slime that must be crossed.
To aid you in these problems you can pick up various items along the
way, jet packs, slime shields (that protect you from going green) and 
other things. Also along the way, you will find pools of water. 
standing in one of these will clean all the slime that you have on
you off.

 The graphics of the game are very good, the slime falls are the 
best, slime actually flows over the side of the caverns. Music 
however is really bad, Whoever wrote it should be shot, it just 
sounds like a collection of random notes, but luck is on your side,
as you can turn it off.

 The size of each adventure is quite massive, big enough to need a
map, although this is done automatically by the game, and you can call
up the computer map at any point.

 Overall the game is very good if you like arcade adventure, but, 
like chips challenge, it's a matter of personal choice, I'd try 
before you buy.
