Here is another article from the D.B.A. !
I dont think that you feel real happy now you know that it is from us !
It seems that I cannot use al the caracters on my keyboard, I dont
know why yet but I will find it out !!
You propably know already wich caracters are missing(just examine the text).

Hey Sammy Joe please tell me the solution of the last question in the
hidden article in Maggie 3.0. !!
If there is anybody else out there who knows also the solution please
write me(Slimer).

Well, on with the craptalk about the projects that were working on.
We are currently working on our second demo(or he is ready when you read
this) called D.B.A. demo 2.
Also soon too be expected is a digi-demo called Betty Boo !!
So, watch out for it........!!

Before I forget we also have a new member called Mr.Cool(former Incoders
from the famous INC.Magazine).
He will now be helping us with swapping and other stuff.

We are now looking for graphics and sound people, so if you are a good
artist please contact us.
The address will be at the end of this article.
