I thought I had finished writing for Maggie for the moment,  after 
my  marathon effort,  earlier in the month,  however it seems that 
the MAGGIE submissions office is still open,  so I thought that it 
would be a good idea to review the first multi-screen STE demo (*) 
to hit these shores...
(*)- Probably...

DELERIOUS III, is still a fairly small demo, by current standards, 
consisting  of  four screens,  a main menu,  a loader,  and intro-
screen,  sort  of  'Lifes  a Bitch' sized....  the intro  sequence 
consists  of the letters 'SOMETHING LIKE THAT' in  huge  bitmapped 
form,  a pixel-sized fly appeares,  buzzes across the screen,  and 
lands on the letter 'O', which teeters, then falls off, to a sound 
of tinkling glass..

You  are  then given some sampled speech I.E.  "Ready to  do  this 
shit..."  and  onto the next bit....  You are given the option  of 
selection of keyboard or joystick for the main menu, standard 4096 
colours  or  extended  32768(!)  colours,  and  if  you  want  the 
questions again (no thank you..)

We  are kindly informed by the coders of the technical details  of 
each  screen,  the main menu has a 25khz soundtracker,  whilst the 
loader  has  a  12.5 khz one...  The main menu is a  huge  virtual 
screen,  about three times the area of the standard ST screen, and 
you  are helped around by the blitter chip,  this screen is rather 
like  the one in the STE 'Jungle Demo' but the graphix are  wildly 
different..  Living  up  to the 'Delerious' tag,  you find  flying 
saucers,   flying  fish,   'Cool'  rabbits,  an  upside  down  and 
stratjacketed Ronald Reagan!!!,  and much more, the sound track is 
an Amiga tune, identified from one of the soundtracker proggies as 
'Balljam'.  This is probably the best screen on the demo, but what 
of the rest, I hear you cry...

The first screen, found by the rabbit, is known as 'Find the Beast' 
has  a six-layer parallax scroll,  and is a nice country  scene... 
With  a  difference,  as bits of the landscape animate as well  as 
scroll,  there are also 32 shades of blue in the top where the sky 
is,  giving effectively,  a 32768 colour palette, (To get an idea, 
you  go from light to dark blue without the joins showing,  a  lot 
like  Amiga  HAM  mode..) The tune is 25khz,  and is the  best  on 
the demo, it is definitely worth listening to all of it..

A  quick word about the loader,  this depicts a little guy sitting 
at  a  desk with an STE,  a tube going into the machine  from  the 
little  guy  as  he  "loads" the machine (I  leave  this  to  your 
imagination!) then he pulls his hair out, in a fit of rage, as the 
demo 'decrunches' the tune is a 12.5 khz ex-Amiga jobbie...

The  next screen,  does not have a name,  but has several parallax 
scrolling layers, and depicts a slug? muppet? alien? on a scooter, 
chasing  an ice-cream van,  where a cornet is held out  invitingly 
over  the  rear,  the  little guy never catches the van,  it is  an 
eternal chase,  both the ground,  and clouds rush by.. The tune is 
another 25khz thing, unknown author, and is quite good, but fairly 
short..

The third screen is found by 'Ronald Regan' and is otherwise known 
as the 'First Bobs demo' giving you nine silvery bobs or balls  on 
a plain black background, until the little cartoon person comes to 
shoot them off the screen!  As he is "Sick of seeing fucking balls 
in  every  demo.." The tune is 12.5 khz,  by an unknown loony  (it 
really is that sort of tune...) 

The final, and perhaps least interesting screen, is the scrolltext 
screen  the only one with a greetings scroller in  fact  (HOORAY!! 
that  makes  a  refreshing change!!) This is in  fact  an  earlier 
screen  coded  on  the  STFM,  and never  used,  consisting  of  a 
multicoloured  large  scrolltext,  and several bobs,  the tune  is 
25khz and very short. (This screen seems to be a spacefiller..)

And  that  is that,  as they say,  a creditable effort,  but still 
early days for the STE,  we await the next efforts of MCS (Who did 
this..) with keen anticipation...

Some rating thingys,,,,,

GRAPHIX:- 89% - Very good,  I only wish there were more of them on 
certain screens,  (the authors advised that they had plenty of CPU 
time  still  left,  but  ran out of graphics  first..)  The  extra 
colours are still nice to see though..

SOUND:-  91%  - Easily the area in which the STE  shows  the  most 
dramatic  improvements,  some very good (Amiga-ripped) soundtracks 
at quite high resolution, and very clear...

ORIGINALITY:-  82%  - This aspect was quite good,  apart from  one 
screen,  avoided  the  endless  procession of  'Special  greetings 
scrolls,  'n  rotating  balls..'  Tried to be funny,  and  largely 
succeeded - Well Done!!!  The main menu particularly,  lived up to 
the 'Delerious' label..

OVERALL:-  90%  - As I personally liked this demo,  I  would  have 
given it more, apart from the fact, that it seemed 'unfinished' in 
certain areas,  could have done with more screens,  and the loader 
was  fairly  iffy,  the demo sometimes crashed in mid-load...  But 
still one for the collection if you have an STE...

Something to note before you go....

If anyone has any STE demos they would like reviewing, please send 
them  to  me,   C  I  Holland,  at  the  Maggie  contact  address, 
preferential  treatment  given  to  multi-screen  mega-epics  over 
single screen efforts, I hope to be able to make a regular feature 
of STE demos in Maggie, so keep on coding out there!!!!!!
