                              by Michael Schuessler

After a long time trying to get the address of a hacker I finally 
succeeded  in finding one that lives in the London area  and  who 
was willing to be interviewed.  The hacker is a member of a  crew 
called  the BBC which hacks games and then put them on their  own 
compacts  (a   compact  is a disc containing two  or  more  newly 
packed  games  !).  I  would like to thank Andy  in  advance  for 
agreeing to this exclusive interview. 

PLEASE  LET  ME  REMIND YOU THAT PIRACY IS ILLEGAL  AND  WILL  BE 
PROSECUTED BY FAST.    

Q: For how long have you been hacking on the ST ?
A: For 3 years.
Q: On any other machine before that ?
A: on the Atari 8 bit for 2 years.
Q: What was the first game on the ST
A: Ranarama
Q: What was your hardest game ?
A: Obliterator (about one week at the time, now I could do it 
   within an hour so !
Q: Why do you hack ?
A: For sexual pleasure
Q: Don't you think it is bad for the software industry ?
A: Yes, but it is not significantly.
Q: How many members are in your group ?
A: Five.
Q: What does each of the members do ?
A: Graffic artist, musician (retired), Phil for general bollox 
   (especially coding + scrollers), Law (hacking and 
   programming) and there is me (the same)
Q: Have you ever thought of coding a game yourself ?
A: Yes.
Q: Why didn't you, maybe because it would be hacked and you would 
   make no profits ?
A: I am pretty confident that I could write a game that could not 
   be hacked. But the contract was a rip off.
Q: How old are you now ?
A: 19.
Q: For how long do you want to continue to hack ?
A: About two year, or until my wive (not that I am married yet) 
   will lock the computer in the cupboard).
Q: What is your current occupation ?
A: Student.
Q: What do you study ?
A: Maths and computing.
Q: What would you do if FAst would pay you a visit ?
A: HIDE in the garden in my secret bunker !
Q: Getting back to the game, would you have written it if you had 
   a better contract ?
A: Yes, definitly.
Q: Why don't you code a freelance game or go to another software 
   company ?
A: If I could think of an idea I would. The trouble with software 
   companies is that the want more experienced programmers and I 
   do not think that they would appreciate my experience. 
Q: I heard that you also do menus using an extremely good packing 
   technique repacking hacked games ? Did you ever think about 
   selling these kind of programs to companies ?
A: Not really because I did not write the packer !
Q: But I heard that the packer is Public Domain and therefore 
   anybody could use it, the Software companies only need 
   somebody who has knowledge of how to pack games etc. ?
A: I have only got a prereleased version of the Packer.
Q: Would you consider that idea in the future ?
A: How could I do that for the software companies without 
   actually showing them our hacked game menus !
Q: What programs do you use to hack games ?
A: My own version of Raid and Easy Raider ?
Q: What do these programs exactly do ?
A: Raid is a debugger ( the protection is only a BIG bug after 
   all) and Easy Raider is a disassembler. 
Q: Do any other programs apart from that ?
A: Not for hacking.
Q: How many games do you hack per week ?
A: That depends on how many come out, thatg varies from none to 
   20.
Q: How long is the average time for you to hack a game ?
A: About ten minutes.
Q: What do you hope to become in future ?
A: God knows. A Programmer.
Q: What kind of a programmer ?
A: A series one. The leisure industrie is not worth the hassle.
   A good game takes about half a year to a year to complete and 
   the payment isn't too good either. But let me tell you, that 
   if there is an outstandingly good game, I won't hack it and 
   buy it instead because in such a case the programmer has well 
   earned his dosh. 
Q: Do you also collect games or do you simply hack them ?
A: Look over there (he says with a simile on his face, for the 
   people who are not currently in this room I should tell you 
   that there are 8 100 disc boxes filled up with games.
Q: Would you hack the game if the software company would send it 
   to you as soon as it is released ?
A: That idea is kinda like black male ? I would not hack a game 
   if there is a message inside it, saying something like this:
   PLEASE DO NOT HACK ME (but the PLEASE must be emphasize).
Q: What do you think about selling hacked games ? 
A: I don't agree with that.
Q: Do you parents do that you hack, and if yes, what do they 
   think about it ? 
A: Yes, they do know it, they don't really mind though because 
   they would try to stop me otherwise.
Q: Do you prefer hacking or programming ?
A: Programming, much more satisfying.
Q: So why don't you do more programming then ? 
A: Lack of original ideas, there is no point in programming 
   something that has already been done.
Q: But wouldn't that give you the experience required to work for 
   a Software company ?
A: Hmm, yeah, I suppose so, but then it would take months on the 
   off chance to get a job !
Q: How long did it take you to learn how to hack ?
A: My first hack was total gues work, I simply changed one branch 
   and now I am learning all the time.

Final word from ME: Thanks a lot Mr Arfling for agreeing to see 
me for this interview. I would like to stress that hacking is 
ILLEGAL and therefore will be dealt with by FAST.

The Hacker's word: I think that the main reason for hacking is 
just a challenge.


THE END
