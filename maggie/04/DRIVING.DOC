
                          DRIVING! - THE DOC 
                          ==================

     We've  been  asked to do another article for The  Lost  Boys  Maggie 
(even  though  the  last one hasn't been  released  yet!),  so  lost  for 
inspiration,  we  decided  to write about a subject that's  dear  to  our 
hearts. Namely - DRIVING!

     So here goes..... 
 
     Let's set the scene first.  We're sat here at Ripped Off HQ (dormant 
for  some months now!).  There's Bilbo,  Stick and Rave (Vill  MC)  here. 
We're drinking Coke,  eating loadsa sweets,  dressing up in each  others' 
clothes and generally having a real FAB time!   Anyway,  we were all  sat 
here  having  a  really good time (as you can imagine!) and a  bit  of  a 
conversation  started.  Stick  wanted Vill's  last  Rolo.   Vill  lowered 
Bilbo's trousers (which Vill was wearing at the time) and said "Take it!"
So he did.   Anyway,  we eventually got round to the subject of cars  and 
driving - hence this article!
     

     Hello , Vill MC here, I'm trying to rush this as fast I can so I can 
get  on  with some more pictures.  As you probably heard  in  an  earlier 
scroller, I purchased a nice shiny new Escort RS Turbo... Well.. Erm...
It's  now a few feet shorter and owned by a scrap yard.  The  Car  itself 
looks  the  Dog Bollocks but they don't tend to  handle  too  well,  mine 
didn't anyway.  To cut a long story short I now have an XR2i which is not 
as lovely as an RS Turbo but handles marginally better. By the way we are 
currently looking for some new members to join our team on the  condition 
that they own a fast car.  Applicants will be notified of the next  trial 
date  as  an  when it becomes available.Please  apply  if  the  following 
applies to you:-

                1. Your car can do 0-60mph in less than 8 seconds 
                 or your bike can do 0-60mph in less than 3  seconds,
                 (we  provide fire extinguishers)
    
                2. You can talk yo your friends in the back seat
                 doing 110mph about re-vector routines with the stereo on 
                 full blast. 
                 
                 3. You  can  recite 'It wasn't my  fault  guv'  without 
                  stuttering.

                 4. You are prepared to be laughed at if you have a shit 
                  car.

                 5.  Your car isn't better than mine.

                 6. Oh!, By the way you must have an ST!

     Ok,  Vill's  back trying to shave his legs with a butter  knife,  so 
I'll take over for a while (or until I get bored - whichever is shorter).
     Yes, Mr. O'Blib here to bore ya sox off for a bit.  Driving.....
BAD  Driving.....    You  know what I'm gonna say  now    F**king  Sierra 
drivers!!!     To   illustrate  my  point,   I'd  like  to  make  a   few 
classifications. They are as follows....

     a) Metro drivers
        Sex - Male
        Age - 95
        Attire - Anything as long as it includes a flat cap
        Attitude  -  I've been driving 76 years without  having  had  an 
        accident.
        Our Reply - Yes, but you've caused 100's you silly old goat!

     b) XR3i drivers
        Sex - Male
        Age - 45
        Hairstyle - None (usually bald or at least receding)
        Wife - A 19 year old blond tart
        Attire - Medallion, open-to-waist shirt, gold sovereign rings
                 (Leisure Suit Larry would drive an XR3i)     
        Attitude - My car is the sportiest, fastest car on the road and
                   I'm attractive to ALL women
        Our  reply - F**k off you old w*nker.  Get a Fiat Panda to  match 
                     your under-performing dick and over-performing ego

     c) Sierra drivers (...the one you've been waiting for!)
        Sex - Male
        Age - Any
        Attire - Shirt & tie. Half a wardrobe hanging on the hand rail.
                 Car phone (optional). 
        Attitude - They own the road so don't get in the way.  They  must 
                   pay more road tax cos they have priority in any  lane 
                   and don't need to indicate. Arrogant bastards who are 
                   unaware of any other road users. Permanently reclined
                   seats. Only use the inside lane on motorways - to 
                   overtake that is!
        Our reply - Apart from the Cosworth, these cars make the drivers
                    become  total  d*ck splashes.  There  is a theory  in 
                    certain circles that these people are dick  splashes 
                    anyway.  I  can't really say much more as  I'm  sure 
                    everybody has come across these tw*ts.

     Well, I think that covers most of the bad drivers on today's roads.
Your  comments and criticisms are welcomed.  Please state car  driven  in 
your reply.  You might as well lie if you've got a Sierra cos we're short 
of bog roll at the moment.

     And now, some hints and tips on good driving from Stick (don't worry 
Sierra drivers, no long words here!)
     
     Well then, what tips can I give you on how to become a good driver?

     Firstly and most importantly, DO NOT buy a Sierra,or even a Volvo.
(Oh  I'd forgotten about Volvo's....) Volvos,  (Or should that  be  their 
drivers?)  really  get on my nerves!  (Almost as much  as  bloody  Sierra 
Morons!)  They are the only vehiclees on the road which are driven  slower 
than  a  Metro.You'll be going along and you can  always  guarantee  that 
somewhere in the course of your journey a Bloody myopic  (Sierra drivers 
note- this means blind.) Volvo driver will suddenly pull out from a  side 
street  or  junction,causing  you  to sh*t  yourself  and  have  to  take 
immediate  avoiding action.  Have you noticed though,when they  pull  out 
it's  always when you're near.The road has been clear for  ages,but  they 
wait until you arrive and then try to plaster you onto the side of  their 
concrete reinforced veichle!
     But I suppose that's it, they have car which can plough into a large 
coach head on at 70mph,killing all the passengers and the Volvo only  has 
a  slight  dent in the front bumper!  The driver knows he can  cause  aqn 
accident and be totally unharmed.The bloody Ploks!

     Volvo's- Built by robots, Driven by dummies.

     Good driving tips:-

1)  Always  have a crisp œ10 note folded in the middle  of  your  driving 
licence,so  that  when PC B*st*rd pulls you for driving while  wearing  a 
brightly  coloured shirt,  he will see it when you show him your  licence 
and hopefully he may not book you.

2)  Always  make sure you warm up your veichles  engine  properly before 
setting off on your journey.  This can be done by  revving the nuts off
  it  for  at least 10 minutes while parked  outside  your  house.This  I 
guaranteed to get you lots of admiring glances from all your neighbours...

3)   Burn off as many Sierra drivers as possible and when one is  up  your 
chuff in the outside lane of the motorway,  slow down,  this is guaranteed 
to amuse him highly!

4)   Always make plenty of room for motorcycles,('cos they're gonna rip 
past you anyway!)

     And  that's about it really.  I dunno if this is gonna go  down  too 
well in an ST disk mag,  but what the hell?  By the way, do we rate as the 
fastest crew on the ST?   On the road,  that is.   My car (yes, it's Bilbo 
again) is a Renault 5 GT Turbo (0-60 in 7.3 secs.), Vill's got an XR2i (0-
60 in 8.1 secs.) and Stick's got some f**k off bike that does it in  about 
3 point something!  If any crews out there want a race, let us know. Until 
then, we must assume we are the fastest!

     Well,  enough trash talk for this article.  I'm sure you (the reader) 
have  got  something better to do than read this.  And I've  got  lots  of 
better things to do than write it!  

     So, it's BYEEE from the boys at Ripped Off......

Bilbo - Bye
Stick - Bye
Vill  - Bye
