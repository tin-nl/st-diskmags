
Here  is the hopefully long awaited PART II of my "WHAT  IS  ..." 
series.  This  time  around a subject more  widely  spread  among 
today's youth will be broached.  Let's take one more swig out off 
my bottle and get cracking.


WHAT IS ... Life without Sense? by Oliver Wagner

- Oh great,  now I've done it again!  Fucked up my physics  exam, 
  fucked up my chemistry exam and failed maths.  Now I won't  get 
  my damn remove. What have I done to deserve this?

- Bitch!  Go ahead and  enjoy yourself, if you love the other guy 
  more than you do me! I'll not forget this, though.
  (Oh God, I think I'll shrivel up and die!)

- Why won't you give me the job?  I'll not make a mess out of it, 
  I promise!  Look at my qualifications.  I have twenty-eight  A-
  Levels, I studied at Oxford and Cambridge, I went to Eton, I...
  You don't like my tie? Ah, I see!!
  (fuck, Fuck, FUCK, messed up again!)

- Mummy,  why-o-why can't I have that lollipop.  I don't want the 
  cod-liver oil! I want the lollipop not afterwards but now, now, 
  now, n...gulp.   Uaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!

Really now,  it's things like that,  which really drive you nuts/ 
mad/bonkers/over the wall. 
Having myself experienced several of the above,  I remember  that 
at  the time I was really pissed off with live,  thinking  if  it 
really was all worth it, the bother and hassle. 

Today's youth,  to which I still think I belong (I'm a meager  18 
years  old)  has  all to often been described  as lazy  bastards, 
having  nothing else to do than:

a) spend their parent's hard  earned money

b) hang around in pubs all night (getting drunk)

c) listen  to perverted  even DANGEROUS music(?) (see PART  I  of 
   "WHAT IS")

d) encourage anarchy

e) and eventually even become criminally involved!

This   is   how  many  people  of  today  chose   to   view   it: 
straightforward,  with both eyes cast upon the result. Never is a 
thought spent on the reason, the cause or the motive, never is an 
eye cast upon the problems surrounding a great proportion of this 
world's population.
Let's see what we have now:

a) Well, for one, there's the pollution growing to uncontrollable 
   levels. Great! Well, whose fault is that?

b) The prospect of  imminent  war (mercifully  less urgent  now), 
   with  thousands of nuclear  warheads racing  across  the  sky, 
   homing in on their prospective objectives. Whose fault is that 
   then?

c) Urban violence getting so bad,  as to render the police  force 
   virtually useless. Where does this stem from?

d) Famine in  the Third World.  Visions of things yet to come  in 
   the Industrial Countries?    

e) There is also  the problem of overpopulation,  in  conjunction 
   with computerization. How will there be enough job's for us to 
   make a big wad of money? 

f) School!!!  I can tell you many a story about the mental stress 
   one is under. Marks are the worst things. You need them to get 
   your remove  and you need them to get a job later on.  Do  you 
   need them to live your live, will you die, if you  don't  have 
   them? Of course not.  

These  are  but  some  of  the  problems,  "normal"  middle-class 
juveniles of today are faced with.  I intentionally used the term 
"normal",  as  people being either very rich or not so  well  off 
have  quite a different variety of reasons,  for behaving  "anti-
social".
Is it any wonder then,  that so many problems cause in turn again 
many misunderstandings between our and the older generation.

Instead  of  only speaking derogatorily of the youth  in  general 
adults would fare better if they remembered their own youth  from 
time  to time.  The problem here is that many parents still  only 
see the material side like money, clothes, food etc.. Undoubtedly 
in this aspect,  many were  worse off than we are  today,  having 
(and I'm taking this information from my own mother) to:

- get up at  five a.m.  and distribute the  paper/milk/bread,  in 
  order to earn some more money.

- help  harvest the  crop in autumn (my mummy lived  in  a  small 
  village in the country) right after school.  Homework? Sometime 
  afterwards between dinner and going to bed. 

Also,  if  they were not exactly starving,  not always  had  they 
enough  to eat (we're talking right after the war  here).  But  I 
will  not bore you any longer,  as you've probably heard  it  all 
before. If not, consider yourself lucky, mac).

If  our parents had it more difficult on the material  side,  how 
was it on the - let's call it - psychological side. 
The problems we face today, certainly didn't apply to our parents 
then.

- Pollution was still at an acceptable level,  with the  chemical 
  industry being still in it's early stages and nuclear  reactors 
  having not yet been invented.

- A World War had just been finished to maintain peace on  Earth. 
  Also, the Atom-Bomb  had  just been invented, not so the ICBMs 
  (inter-continental ballistic missiles). 

- Urban  violence?  Tell  me  why!  None of  the  other  problems 
  existed yet,  so there wasn't all that much reason for it,  was 
  there now.

- There was famine in the Third World, but not so pronounced. And 
  who  knew anything  about it anyway.  The news  medias  weren't 
  interested. 

- Computerization?  Come again. Computer...  what, son? Computers 
  were three storeys high and slower than the Commodore VC-20  or 
  even slower than Amiga!  Also, there were enough jobs, at least 
  till a  decade  after  the war  (many  people  killed  and  the 
  rebuilding of the destroyed cities).

- School certainly was important, but not to such an extent as it 
  is today.  If you  had gotten bad marks,  you would still  have 
  been given a job. No sir, no unemployment.

In general,  school was not some sort of pastime,  but a place to 
learn  something.  Better marks automatically meant a better  job 
and thus more money. 
Today it is different.  The qualifications you need to get a good 
job have been driven to an extreme. Many young persons with three 
or  four  A-Levels (oder das deutsche Abitur ou  le  baccalaur‚at 
fran‡ais)  under their belt and having successfully studied at  a 
university,  still find it difficult to get a job.  An impossible 
situation.

"Why should I bother learning, when I won't even get a job in the 
end. I mean fuck it all!" 
So speaks many a disillusioned juvenile with a not very promising 
future.  The bitter truth though is, that all I'm writing here is 
nothing but the truth, so help me God! 


Up  to  now,  all I've done is talk about us  and  our  problems. 
Admittedly  the difficulties we face are grave,  but  what  about 
those  people  with existential problems,  such  as  drought  and 
famine. 
As  you've probably seen quite a few times in the 9 O'Clock  News 
on  BBC,  nearly  every year there is another  catastrophe  which 
takes  thousands (sometimes millions/famine in Ethiopia of a  few 
years ago) of lives. 
Only  last week there was the earthquake in the Philippines  with 
an  estimated 1000 people dead and so many thousand  injured  and 
without home. 
A few months ago there was the desaster in Iran with over  70,000 
people  dead.  I mean,  can you believe it?  A city  larger  than 
Guildford near London disappearing just like that. 
Then there was the relatively small  earthquake in San  Francisco 
and the massive one in Armenia. 

Come  on now!  Do you think the people involved (what a word)  in 
these desasters have any hope left.  They just battle on, because 
they don't know any other way. 
I  realize that this example is a bit far-fetched but I  have  no 
other  way to show you that in reality most of us are  very  well 
off.  

- In  the industrialized  western  countries,  most  of  us  have     
  enough  to eat, we have a roof over our head (though  let's not     
  forget the homeless persons).  

- The  danger  of  a nuclear war  hanging  over  our  heads  like     
  Damocle's  sword,  has been diminished through Perestroika  and 
  through various treaties between the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R..

- The unification of the two Germanies helped pull Europe  closer 
  together.

- Environmental problems are now being attacked on an interstatal 
  basis.  Though still in it's beginnings,  it is a definite step 
  towards caring for our planet. HANDLE WITH CARE!!!!

What  I really wanted to say is this:  be  more  positive,  think 
positive,  be  more of an optimist and last but not  least  enjoy 
what you have, be more content.
This sounds like a lecture from your granny, which in a way it is 
supposed  to be.  Off course,  I can't tell you how to live  your 
life and I don't want to do it.
But  the "what-the-heck" sentiment is getting more widely  spread 
every day. This is no way to spend one's days. 

                   *************************
                   *LIVE IS SHORT, ENJOY IT*
                   *************************

Certainly,  I am also sometimes pissed of with life,  but them  I 
think about the good times I've had. 
If you really think about it even you have had some of those. 

And  if  not,  well,  don't  just sit there and  feel  sorry  for 
yourself. Go out there and do something for yourself.
If  for example you can't find a job in your town,  be  flexible. 
Move around.  Follow the job demands. And if you still can't find 
a job,  leave your country and go somewhere,  where the standards 
of education aren't as high.  Show INITIATIVE.  That shouldn't be 
so difficult. 

If  on  the  other hand you have a  job,  but  still  don't  feel 
satisfied,  join  an international organization like  Greenpeace, 
WWF  or Amnesty International.  They'll always be glad  for  your 
support.

Even  as a youth you can do several things like  doing  community 
work. With your friends this might even turn out to be great fun.


P.S.  I must admit something, though. I have moved around since I 
was  about  four.  First to Berne in  Switzerland,  then  Moscow, 
followed by London and now I am in Geneva/Switzerland. It is easy 
now for me to say:  "Do this'n'that",  but I realize,  that it is 
not as easy as that. 
My  parents  grew  up in small villages in  Germany  and  I  have 
visited  those places.  I know,  that if my parents  hadn't  left 
there,  I would today now the village,  the nearest town and  the 
rest  of Germany would be unknown territory. 
Since  I  left at an early age,  I had time to  adapt  myself  to 
changing  circumstances  in the world  of  today.  Everything  is 
coming  closer together now,  with improved relations and  better 
travelling possibilities. 
Now,  if  a  large horizon concerning  politics  etc.  is  indeed 
commendable,  I  still  feel as if I've missed out on  a  lot  of 
things.  Moving  around  every  three  or  four  years  has  it's 
advantages as it has it's problems.
For  example you have to find new friends every  time,  which  is 
difficult if you don't know the language or mentality.  Also  you 
miss  out on the community as you have none.  Many  people  don't 
like foreigners, as you probably well know.

Also, if I speak above of doing something to help give your  live 
some  sense,  so  you can later  say:  "Look  at  this'n'that,  I 
achieved  that.",  I  must  add  that  I  have  no  part  in  any 
organization anywhere.  Why?  you may ask. Well to be truthful, I 
couldn't really be bothered.  What I just don't have is the right 
motivation. And there you have it.


Till the next issue of DISK MAGGIE,  hopefully being No.4, here's 
cheerio  to all you avid readers (I think it's the  Ed.  and  the 
author) of "WHAT IS ... ?"
