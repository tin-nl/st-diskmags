
             THE NEW CO-OPERATION BETWEEN 

                         MAGGIE  
                                        &
                                              THE DISK MAGAZIN

(See end of article for Info on the New Scroller)

     As  you  have  probably heard already  this  issue  of  Disk 
Magazin is the last one ever in the great world of the Atari  ST. 
Due to lack of time Timo (ex-author of this so famous German disk 
magazine)  had to stop his maggie.  He is now sitting  beside  me 
with tears in his eyes while An Cool is pretty pissed of  because 
Flossy the Sheep did not really enjoy it.... (see other article).  

     This  issue  was already planned to be a  joined  production 
about  2 months ago and Timo just told me today that this is  his 
last issue and that he will continue to work for Maggie (well  we 
got  rid  of one magazine,  I wonder which one  is  next   ??  ST 
NEWS!?!  No chance there,  wishful thinking, I actually want this 
magazine to continue as it is so different to maggie).  

     You  might  have  released that Maggie never  ever  had  any 
hardware reviews so far,  this will change from now on,  Timo who 
used  to do heeps of that stuff will continue this  section.   We 
also  have  quite  a few other new  features,  like  a  new  text 
displayer (it is fast !!!! (by Timo)) and another one which has a 
long  history.  You  might have heard about  another  Dutch  disk 
maaaagaaaazine  (as  they say in Duckland)  called  News  Channel 
which only did two issues (it was by Galtan 6, but due to lack of 
time (again) they had to seize their production) from whom we got 
a  pretty  nice text displayer.  BUT after I tried to  include  a 
depacker  routine,  it  did not BLOODY work any  more.  Dogue  de 
Mauve, ENS and I sat there for about 5 hours this afternoon after 
which  we finally gave up (it was a very strange  bug,  we  still 
have  no  idea  what was wrong with  it).  Dogue  de  Mauve  then 
volunteered  to  code  a  new gfa routine  (it  looks  very  nice 
although  you can't quite use the mouse).  We also have a  colour 
selector  which  is very helpful for the  blind  people.  Talking 
about  the blind people in this dreadful world,  another  special 
feature for them,  a BRAIL SCROLLER (ok, bad joke, I apologize to 
all the blind people reading this,  oh damn, should not have said 
that. 

     Back   to   some   more   serious   stuff,    one   of   the 
((f\zdfhwsrnstruiw5s) <--- message from TGE) future issue of this 
great  joined production (MAGGIE & DISK MAGAZINE) will feature  a 
little game for the menu !  It has been done before in demos, but 
why should not we do it ?  It is a maze type game with  different 
levels where you can wonder about,  get lost,  like the lost boys 
did  in OSS with some very nice girls called YVETTE,  MORMON  AND 
SUSANNE let me tell you, Dutch girls are some of the nicest girls 
I have ever encountered in my long sex life!!!). How long is your 
dong ?  This is the name of a great "break your joystick as  fast 
as  possible"  game (something for Anders,  he does not  need  to 
abuse these poor sheeps anymore) where you simply have to  wobble 
the joystick around in order to see some obscene animations along 
with some funny squeaking noises (for more info on a similar game 
look  for the second hidden article in this issue  featuring  The 
Subhumans in Turkey).

This is all for this issue, the new and improved Maggie Team wish 
you a happy new years and along with that many girls and a lot of 
booze.

                 HOW TO USE THE NEW TEXTSCROLLER!
                 --------------------------------


Hi guys!

This  is T & T-SOFT on the keyboard to tell you how to  use  this 
new textscroller. Till the moment you activate a text nothing has 
been changed!  After this you find a new designed screen.  At the 
right border you see a box (called slider) moving within a bigger 
box! This is the present position within the text!

-.  Klicking  on the upper arrow or pressing the cursorup-key you 
can scroll the text up (line by line!).

-.  Klicking  on  the lower arrow or pressing the  cursordown-key 
the text scrolls down (line by line!).

-.  Klicking  between the upper arrow and the slider or  pressing 
the cursorleft-key you can flip one page up.

-.  Klicking between the bottom of the slider and the lower arrow 
or pressing the cursorright-key you can flip one page down.

-.  Klicking  on  the slider and holding  the  mousebutton  while 
moving  the  mouse you can choose the position  within  the  text 
directly!


Hope you like this new scroller!

                                   Bye says Timo of T & T-SOFT
