You may remember the original STRIDER,  a while back, it had dinky 
sprites,  reasonable presentation and once you had got to the end, 
it was all a dream, sorry, simulation.... Why? you might ask, well 
the sequel, is out now, and incredibly, will form the basis of the 
STRIDER  II coin-op,  a feat achieved by very few computer games..  
here...  (  The original STARGLIDER made it on to a Bally/Williams 
coin-op,  but  was  not  widely seen here...) The  inevitable  Q's 
coming  up,  I  feel,  how does it play /look /feel /sound  /taste 
/reformat.

Welll.........

Firstly,  the  screen area devoted to the gameplay has shrunk ever 
so  slightly,  whilst  the  sprites have taken vitamins  and  body 
building courses in the interim period, and are larger... In fact, 
the  bottom third of the screen is not playing area  anymore.  The 
graphics  are  very similar to the original in style  and  content, 
robots,  humanoids,  and  I  even understand in later levels,  that 
some of the dinosaurs from the original have been retained in this 
game.

The  hero  is just as acrobatic as before,  he is able to run  and 
jump,  as  athletically  as before,  and in addition to his laser-
scythe  thingy,  he  has  a gun if you stand still and  press  the 
firebutton,  which  is useful for longer reached enemies...  There 
are  occasional  power-ups that permit him to turn into  a  robot, 
which  is  invunerable,  but not able to proceed vertically..  You 
have  to watch those energy levels very carefully,  otherwise it's 
goodnight, and back to the beginning of the level (AAwwwWW!) or to 
the last 'trigger point' within a level (Which is the beginning in 
my  case..)  Enemies,  on the ground,  and also in the air,  appear 
with  frightening  regularity  and  speed,  so a  goodish  set  of 
reflexes are desirable to play this game...

Sonically, the tunes have been recycled from the original STRIDER, 
and are quite good in themselves, but a bit of a disappointment if 
you are expecting something new........

The graphix, are attractively coloured, and being slightly larger, 
are  more like an arcade game,  they also manage a reasonable turn 
of speed too...

Now, some ratings, (I am tired, and you wouldn't believe the number 
of  mistakes I made in typing this review - like about three  made 
right now in the previous minute!!!)

GRAPHIX:-  77%  - Bright,  attractively done,  very similar to the 
original STRIDER..

SONIX:- 65% - A good tune, the SAME as the original.........

PLAYABILITY:-  81%  -  This  is quite  a  playable  game,  with  a 
versatile main character, but there are fewer power-ups than, say, 
TURRICAN,  and you get shoved back to the start,  or whatever,  if 
you lose a life (Booo!!).... 

OVERALL:- 79% - Not a bad attempt to follow on from the  original, 
but it does only that, without breaking any new ground, I think it 
is expensive,  at œ24.99, but I leave it to you to decide if it is 
worth it, try it to see if you like it before taking it home.....
