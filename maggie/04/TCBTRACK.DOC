Firstly, the missing bit...

``````REALLY HARD SWEARING AND X-CERTIFICATE SEX``````````````````

Or PART 2 of this review, take your choice.....

Well  thanks for wanting to continue with the review anyway,  this 
bit or addendum to the original is being written in late Sept,  as 
firstly,  Maggie issue 3 is still in production,  the European CES 
haf  come und gone (More on that elsewhere...) and I now have  the 
finished final product,  TCB Tracker version 1.0 to hand,  and can 
offer some more detailed advices after having used it  extensively 
for a few days....

To  start with,  the bottom third of the screen displays the  four 
tracks together,  anything you enter is displayed on the track you 
are  working on in alphanumeric format,  the tracks count down  in 
hexadecimal (base sixteen, you thick gits..) format. The technique 
used  to  write music on this is a lot easier than  certain  other 
trackers (Qu*r*et..) as you can hear what you are doing a step  at 
a time and can modify it accordingly.  Step programming means that 
everything  you do is kept together,  so it is much easier to work 
out  where  you are,  and you don't get hopelessly lost like  with 
some other programs (Quar**t...). 

TCB  Tracker  uses a clear to read,  and largely  self-explanatory 
main  screen,  the  functions on the left hand side deal with  the 
major  functions  of 'Save-Load-play,  also 'RECord for  when  you 
decide  to commit a sample to one of the four channels.  You  have 
the  option of loading in samples,  songs (without sample  data..) 
and  MOD  files  (songs and a complete custom  sample  set..)  The 
tracker uses its own Gem-like screen handling,  but has nothing to 
do with GEM. You can play out the sound through the monitor, or an 
external source, via ST Replay, or through the STE stereo jacks.

This  is also the first program on commercial release to  properly 
support the STE's Extra sound production facilites, the tracker is 
switchable  between  'normal ST and the extra hardware,  Bass  and 
treble are adjustable if the tracker is on an STE. 

To  return  to aspects of music making,  samples are entered  at  a 
chosen  pitch,  into  the  chosen channel,  to build  up  patterns 
(approx  forty steps make up a pattern..) Your patterns  are  then 
assembled in order to make up a song,  these can be moved about at 
will into the desired positions, a Restart position being selected 
for  the  end/beginning of a song,  and away you go.  The  program 
oozes  user-friendliness (Review cliche 3 million  and  twelve...) 
and  picking-up on how it works is intuitive and quick (as a  good 
proggy  should  be...)  and  it is possible  to  get  some  fairly 
respectable results in the space of, say, less than an hour....

OTHER USEFUL 'TWIDDLY' BITS:-

Drum machine mode, every sample is accessed from the keyboard, and 
the channels are programmed accordingly.  You can select whichever 
of the four channels you want to listen to at any time, Amiga bass 
slows  down  any converted Amiga MOD.files,  you can  select  disk 
drives  from  the  main screen,  you can 'selectively'  bin  whole 
modules,  songs only,  or individual samples. All the functions on 
the screen in icon form are available from the keyboard as well.

I  have not tried out the cut-and-paste,  or sample tuning effects 
yet,  but these look good, and should be good (In keeping with the 
overall  standard  of  the  program..)  The  keyboard  layout  for 
entering  notes,  is  slightly  strange  at first,  but is  not  a 
problem.

Some general points and final words......
Bugs....Only  very occasionally locks up,  upon completion of SAVE 
operation,  also, on a half-meg machine, does not like really long 
(Over 130 kb..) MOD files,  which is not a pressing problem. After 
fairly intensive use, this is a package I am confident in, and not 
irritated with, and it is considered reliable. 

There  is also at least one disk of additional .MOD files for  the 
program,  some  of  the samples are spectacularly dodgy,  but  the 
general  quality is ok,  and if you are dissatisfied,  the tracker 
can use any SPL sample file.  Personally,  after use,  I can still 
recommend  this package,  and suggest that you get it,  if you are 
into music-making in any form...

(C)IH - 27/09/90 it is now cold at night....

I  hope you had a good laugh at the sixth paragraph of  the  first 
half  of  the review,  as I gather TCB have had a little  'problem 
with their hard-drive, so an early release for their demo is oudda 
da question, Well did YOU see any screens at the CES !!???!!!

       YET MORE WIBBLE ON TCB-TRACKER RELATED MATTERS.....

By Chris ...Nov '90

It  is now f*cking freezing at night,  having come a long way from 
the heatwave of Aug/Sept 1990,  and TCB Tracker version 1.1 is now 
to hand.. Improvements include some bug-fixing, well I did'nt find 
any major trouble,  and also the addition of an Amiga .MOD file to 
Tracker converter program. This currently requires one meg to work 
in, and is not compatible at present with all .MOD files.. Fine, I 
said,  having  got  my  extra half-meg in  the  week  before..(NOW 
there's a story!!! more of which in another part of the Maggie...)

I  tried out several .MOD files from Equinoxe,  ST-Connexion,  and 
other soundtrackers, and got about a 50% success rate for these. I 
spoke  to  MPH who advised that Noisetracker files have  the  best 
conversion  rate,  most  of their files successfully translate  to 
Tracker,  Hopefully  there will be a converter program which  will 
work  on  a 512k machine,  and also convert (hopefully)  all  .MOD 
files from whichever original format..

Also  now  available  are 8-9 (at time of  writing..)  extra  .MOD 
disks,  and  two  .SPL disks,  I plumped for the .MOD disks,  which 
appear  to have been done with the current converter program,  the 
quality  is variable,  some samples obviously being more difficult 
than  others  to  translate..  The  disks are  a  mixture  of  all 
'musical'  tastes,  synth  and guitar rave-ups,  a stunningly good 
'Dick Tracey' mix on disk 3,  all of them Amiga originals, the odd 
tune heard in a commercial release,  but most of them from famous, 
or notorious Amiga demos, including the Red-Sector Megademo...

Overall,  most of my post-Maggie 2 activities seem to be connected 
with this bloody program, (Apart from playing Turrican and writing 
this lot...),  and most of my earlier observations still stand,  I 
also  gather  from  MPH that the  soundtrack  to  POWERMONGER  was 
written on the Tracker, and most of the major software houses have 
expressed keen interest,  as they can port over Amiga tunes to the 
ST,  saves  the  extra cost of commissioning an ST-soundchip  tune 
apparently, (Sorry David Whittacker......)

Some  of  the Amiga-converted .MODs are not as clear  as  I  would 
like,  but  at the same time,  I have had no problems with samples 
taken from these sources, original samples (As done by MPH...) are 
better.... 

A quick word on Noisetracker,  bundled with Maggie 3.0,  thank you 
very much...    EEErrrrmMMMM!!!

No,  hang on, lets try a bit more, Noisetracker is very similar to 
TCB  Tracker  in layout,  the method of tune creation is  in  fact 
identical to Tracker and uses a very similar keyboard-layout.. The 
method of tune-building is the same, but it does not have the more 
advanced  editing features of TCB Tracker..  On the plus side,  it 
does  have  compatibility  with Amiga Noisetracker  and  other  ST 
soundtracker  files,  (But  not  TCB .MODs..) and is  also  Public 
Domain  (at  present....) against TCB Tracker being  a  full-price 
program,  the  sound quality is very similar,  it is not not known 
how  much CPU time it uses,  generally it does not sound too  bad, 
but it is a bit short on the sort of features that you get in  TCB 
Tracker,  which,  I suppose,  illustrates the difference between a 
P.D. program, and a full price one...

Out of the two, Noisetracker is only going to be known to the keen 
P.D'ers,  whilst  TCB  Tracker  is  being  reviewed  and  marketed 
extensively, and going from strength to strength as a result..

Still,  Noisetracker  is what you would call a good P.D.  program, 
and  if  your  finances  don't run to  TCB  Tracker,  then  it  is 
definitely worthwhile...

Hope  to  pick up some more samples,  and other tasty P.D.  at the 
Shopper  Show at Wembley,  on the 7-8 December 1990,  also hope to 
have  most  of my articles for Maggie 4 finished  by  then..  (FAT 
CHANCE!!!)

           See you-u-u-u-u again soo-o-o-o-o-nnnn!
               Chris H.  (30.11.90)
