                         ATTENDED TO BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

     This show was big, it was enormous. The exhibition halls had 
to  be extended to 3 halls and also they made the  Thursday  open 
for the public.  The show was devided up into two groups,  one of 
which was the Acorn hall downstairs and the other two were  Atari 
ST and Amiga. 

     Before one could even get this far one had to pay the  entry 
fee  which was far too expensive for my taste (œ5 or œ4 when  you 
had some vouchers from various magazines).  For the first time  a 
computer show was based in the Wembly Conference Centre and  what 
a  bummer  it  was to get there.   The show  was  pretty  crowded 
throughout the entire show.  Strange enough no demo crews  showed 
up apart from TLB, The Watchmen and the Dynamic Duo. 

     This show was quite different in comparison to the  Computer 
Entertainment Show,  at this one there were no software companies 
whatsoever.   The  stands  which  were  mainly  present  were  PD 
libraries and shops selling games or hardware. The best bargain I 
found was that I bought disks for 24p each. 

     As there were no real releases at the show there is not much 
to talk about apart from what we did.  Chris Holland and I filled 
us  up  with coffee which we got free from the press  office  and 
David  Moss (Spatz) ran around chasing his  beer.   You  probably 
think that this review is rather boring, well, I agree with you. 

    The  first ever TT to be found at a computer show in  the  UK 
was at the 16/32 stand.  Let me tell you that the TT surely is an 
amazing  machine,  the resolution is perfect,  the GEM  does  not 
crash  as easy and and and.  On display on the TT was  its  first 
ever demo which was coded by the Inner Circle !  It consisted  of 
sinus dots moving about forming different shapes, it looked quite 
nice but can also be programmed on the normal ST.   A few new STE 
demos  were also floating about like the Alliance Demo  III  (STE 
only),  Le  Micron demo by the Overlandes  which was coded for  a 
show  in  Paris  and  also a few  other  minor  demos  not  worth 
mentioning.  Come  to think of it,  there was another  demo,  the 
Dragon's Lair demo II which had some more animated sequences from 
the game along with some marvellously digitized sound.

     For  a  small advert let me tell you about the 16  Bit  fair 
coming up in January.  The show will take place at the Novotel in 
Hammersmith on January the 4th,  5th and the 6th.  The Lost  Boys 
might be having a stand there, depending on whether or not we can 
get the stand cheap enough ! 

Well,  this is it really,  I won't blabber on any more,  have fun 
reading the other articles !
