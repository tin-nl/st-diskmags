A Day in the death of............?

Well  no-one specific...  I thought it would be a good idea to see 
what I can come up with on a 'Christmas theme' which at the moment 
is nowt,,,

BUT FIRSTLY, LADEEEZ AND CHENNULLMEN...
    I AM PROUD TO PREEEZENT....


              OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
             O                                           O
             O  DEAD NONENTITIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       O
             O                                           O
              OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

  Well, there's STAMPEDE Disk magazine for starters...

A sad loss,  we don't think!!!  Simply put, Stampede overestimated 
the  number  of  copies  being sold,  and ran out  of  money,  the 
Official  Receiver being called in,  as the November issue hit the 
streets..  In  fact Jengrove Enterprises were formally wound-up on 
the  8th  November 1990,  their accountants Grant  Thornton  being 
appointed  to deal with things from there under the provisions  of 
the Insolvency Act (1986) (Phew! heavy stuff..)

At this point I feel I have to disclose a terrible secret...

************Chris's Terrible Secret!!!!!!!!!*******************

I HAD A SUBSCRIPTION TO STAMPEDE!!!!!!!!!

Well  I  thought it wouldn't do any harm at the time,  a bit  of  a 
laugh and that,  and with my mates going on at me,  I just gave in 
(sob sob...) It was at the Shopper Show '89, and I only paid about 
twenty  quid  or so anyway,  and got a free game as well....  They 
wound  up with only one issue on the current year to go,  and  in 
spite  of all thats been said about them,  they have at least kept 
me in 'blank' disks....

I  had to tell you this,  otherwise you would have been  wondering 
where I got my detailed info, giving names and dates from...

The official reason for Stampedes demise was given as  circulation 
being  too low  to cover costs,  we would also suggest  (AND  have 
indeed said so in earlier Maggies..) that the general quality  and 
interest  was lacking a bit,  the quality of writing was none  too 
brilliant, and it seemed to lack 'something'...

N.B.  'Something'  that  indefinable quality that  makes  anything 
stand out from the crowd, be it a publication, or game...

I  am  sorry  to say,  but reading it left you with  the  feeling, 
'where's  the  rest of it?..' Apparently things were  not  well  at 
Jengrove  for some time,  as their writers were late in being paid 
(Or not being paid at all!) One writer considering himself "Lucky" 
he lost a few hundred pounds, this is pretty serious, in our view, 
if you are undertaking a career in computer journalism, and expect 
to eat on the basis of said career! Our sympathies go out to these 
people,  at least on Maggie,  you KNOW from the start that you are 
working for fame, if not fortune!

Turning  now  to  another publishing casualty,  the  period  since 
summer has also seen the demise of Popular Computing Weekly.. I am 
actually  being unfair in putting this in the Nonentities  corner, 
as in it's day PCW or 'Pop' to it's friends was a very good  weekly 
computer  mag,  it  was  at the height of its powers in  the  mid-
eighties  period,  being the best of three (Three!) weeklies,  and 
when  the  other two faded in the lean years before  16  bits,  it 
carried on..

However,  it  seemed to lose its way in the last two years or  so, 
spawned  a  truly abysmal games weekly which lasted  a  few  weeks 
only,  and  which was re-absorbed into the main body of 'Pop'  and 
seemed  to have no answer to the rise of the new  upstart  weekly, 
New Computer Express..  Towards the end,  availability (In my area 
at  least..)  became  intermittant,  and finally  in  October,  no 
more...  This leaves NCE as the sole weekly computer maggie in the 
UK... 

Back to the Dead Celebrities..............

There is the resignation of M.  Thatcher as the UK prime minister, 
which is VERY SIGNIFICANT INDEED,  possibly the political event of 
the  year  here.  Unlike our 'friend' Ceaucescu,  "interviewed" in 
Maggie  3  she,  at  least,  avoided getting shot.  (By what small 
margin though?? )

We are still waiting for Saddam Hussein (At time of  writing.....) 
for that exclusive piece - Saddam Hussein,  his life,  loves,  and 
disembowellings...  Still  patience rewards he who waits......  On 
current form, expect something about mid-Jan 1991...

And  at  last,  some Christmas thoughts,  from a selection of  ex-
notables, over to you JULIUS CAESAR.....

JC:- "Christmas? You mean to say about 44 years after I bought the 
Coliseum,  someone  in one of the Roman Empire's least significant 
Mid-Eastern provinces was born,  and was responsible for the first 
worldwide  religion!?!??!!   Pull  the  other  one,   it's  got  a  
gladiator on it!!!! "

MAGGIE:- "Errrm, Ceaucescu.....???"

CEAUCESCU:-  "I  bloody well HATE Christmas,  I got  stiffed  last 
year, remember ?! no turkey beforehand or nuffink !! "

MAGGIE:-  "Well thanks very much,  you over there!  What is it you 
want to say? "

NIGEL:- "Thank you,  I'm Nigel, nephew of Vlad The Impaler, I love 
Christmas,  me!  We  had  some great family get-togethers at uncle 
Vlad's place.. Up first thing on Christmas day, loads of prezzies, 
great dinner, a brisk walk in the country afterwards, and loads of 
people  thrust  onto pointed sticks in their  final  death-agonies 
and...."

MAGGIE:-  "Yes thank you very much,  do you want to say  something 
the  cast  of  that  great  afternoon  children's  T.V.  programme 
'RAINBOW??"

CAST OF RAINBOW:- 'Zippy' - "Hello everybody,  do you want to know 
what I'm getting for Christmas (Get on with it!) Yes!  I'm getting 
a vivisection kit so I can carry out grotesque medical experiments 
on  Bungle  and  George,  whom  we all know are a  right  pair  of 
twats..."

'George'  the cloth hippo:- "Thats not very nice Zippy,  I'll tell 
Jeffrey..."

'Zippy':-  "Well  we all know he's a transsexual anyway,  and  is 
having the 'op' next spring.."

'Bungle' The totally unfeasible bear :- "You're very horrid Zippy, 
I  love  Jeffrey,  and  always will,  even if he does have a  sex-
change.."

'Jeffrey':- "Well look what the cat dragged in,  I've just been to 
the Dildo-u-Like sex shoppe,  Oh look,  here come Roddy, Jane, and 
the other pillock to sing us a song about..."

****INSERT LOUD SCREAMS AND FLAMETHROWER NOISES AT THIS POINT****

MAGGIE:- "Well that was cruel,  but necessary,  and fun too!! Noel 
Edmonds if you please!"

NOEL:- "Well I always appear on TV on Christmas day,  but I'm not 
actually dead y...YAAAAEEEAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!"

MAGGIE:-  "The  Schickelgruber (TM) range of  mantraps,  always  a 
perfect surprise for the Yuletide season...."

HANNIBAL:- "Well I prefer elephants actually..."

MAGGIE:-  "Hang  on,  I  haven't finished yet,  it's your go in  a 
minute mate!!"

HANNIBAL:- "Sorry pal.."

MAGGIE:- "Well that's OK, you can do your piece now.."

HANNIBAL: "Thanks, well I prefer elephants actually..."

JEFF  MINTER:-  (Yes it is he!!) - "Well I think you  lifted  that 
from an old Llamasoft ad actually..."

MAGGIE:-  "You could be right there,  but what are you going to do 
about  it,  bearing  in mind that this enviroment  is  controlled, 
creatively speaking,  by me, the writer... I could turn you into a 
sixteen-headed purple-skinned dragonfly, or have you join the cast 
of 'Rainbow'. So I say tough shit matey! "

JEFF MINTER:- "WUUUURRRRBBLLEEEBOOOIINGGGG HICCCC !!!"

MAGGIE:-  "We THINK that is what a  sixteen-headed  purple-skinned 
dragonfly sounds like anyway..."

"Anyone else ?? Oh, I think everyones gone, Hello!? HELLO!!!...."

- might as well burn that bloody ouija board anyway,  more trouble 
than it's worth..................
