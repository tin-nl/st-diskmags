    HOW TO REMOVE THE BOTTOM BORDER BY POWER MAN OF THE WILD BOYS
    -------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, alright, I know you have probably seen an article like this in
every disk magazine there is, but my routine is much better than the one
by TEX in ST NEWS. Their routine left a horrible fish or whatever they
call it at the bottom right hand corner of the screen. If you haven't any
idea what I am talking about, then I mean the routine by TEX caused the
video chip to miss out the last 2 bytes of the screen before moving below
the border. This caused everything in the border to be shifted by 1 bitplane
and in general made a bit of a mess. But have no fear, the Powerman is here
with his 'much better than the TEX one' border routine! As I said, my one
is much tidier, and doesn't mess up the screen at all.

So, Mr Powerman, how does it work. Well, the principle is the same as the TEX
routine. What happens is, on the last scanline the computer waits until the
right border is reached by the electron beam, and then switches to 60 HZ. Then
a few NOP instructions make the computer wait for a bit more, and then goes 
back to 50 HZ. If you dont know what 50 HZ and 60 HZ is, then it is the 
speed at which the screen is updated, either 50 or 60 times a second.
The TIMER B interrupt is used to do the switching (see my article on rasters
if the Lost Boys have included it, for an explanation of the TIMER B).

To put grafix in the border, just treat the screen as if its 30 lines or so 
longer than a normal screen. I am not sure how many extra lines are drawn, but
on my monitor, I can easily see about 30.

Now, all thats left is for you to assemble the program BORDER.S and be amazed!

I would like to say that I don't mean to offend TEX or anything becuase my
routine is better. In fact, I think they are great and I think they were one of
the first crews to remove the bottom border, so I hope they will not be too 
angry if they see this......

If you are a grafix artist or can do wicked muzix, then read my ad in the
contacts section, if it has been included.

See ya dudes!
