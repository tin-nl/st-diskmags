I found this particular game at the Computer Shopper Show,  having 
been newly released... This was a pleasant surprise, and as I have 
fond  memories  of the original SPINDIZZY,  on the Amstrad CPC,  I 
decided  to  get  the  thing,  to evaluate for  MAGGIE,  and  also 
hopefully to enjoy it as well.......

So  how does it match up to it's illustrious predecessor,  has  it 
been  able  to  keep up with more advanced  Atari  ST  technology, 
happily, I can say it does.....

Firstly, the graphics have undergone a major cosmetic overhaul, in 
keeping with the resolution,  colours etc on the ST, everything is 
an attractive combination of 16 colours,  at the same time,  there 
is  far more by way of screens..  SPINDIZZY WORLDS is a far larger 
game  than  the original,  which at the time was considered a  big 
game.  You  are  able  to visit a range of  different  landscapes, 
ranging  from parkland,  through a landscape composed of  pyramids 
and  ramps,  to one which is largly say,  water or molten lava abd 
narrow walkways. 

At  the same time,  there are more 'incidental' features,  such as 
trees,  fencing,  etc,  and  also  a  range of aliens in the 'Hard 
Cluster' including killer Penguins..!! Generally, there are a vast 
range  of  different  things to see,  and not just the  'same  old 
abstract landscape' as you might have expected.

There is not too much sound in this game,  music being confined to 
the  title  track,   which  is  a  reasonable  QUARTET  tune,  and 
occasional  spot effects in the game when needed....  The relative 
absence of sound is not a feature which detracts from the game  in 
any case.....

The  awesome  thing  about the original  was  its  uniqueness  and 
incredible playability,  to be fair,  it did take some elements of 
MARBLE  MADNESS,  but managed to evolve into a much better  longer 
term game.. There has not exactly been a rush of this type of game 
in appearing on the ST (well none to be exact...) and I am pleased 
to see that the playability of the original has translated so well 
to  the  ST..  (Sorry  to keep on harping on  about  the  original 
SPINDIZZY,   but   they  did  insist  on  calling  this  SPINDIZZY 
WORLDS...) 

You  have the option of starting off on the easy or hard  cluster 
of  worlds,  the easy cluster being recommended to start off with. 
The  game  then offers the choice of individual  worlds,  selected 
from  a  3-D  rotating display.  Once on a world,  control  is  by 
joystick,  the  firebutton  is used to give turbo-acceleration  to 
your character,  the little spinning-top known as GERALD,  and the 
spacebar to bring him to a dead stop.

Progress  is made by collecting gems,  and finding the way out  of 
the  level,  on  the way,  you have to hit switches to open doors, 
and start lifts which are necessary to complete the level..  There 
are sometimes,  certain sequences of switches that you have to set 
in  the  correct order..  There are plenty of good ol' ramps,  and 
slopes,  and  other wibbly bits unique to SPINDIZZY and plenty  of 
chances  to  fall off if you get it wrong.  The viewpoint  can  be 
altered to enable you to see where you are, if you are temporarily 
hidden  by  a  large 3-D object,  according to the  author,  there 
should  not be any part of the game which is 'impossible' to  see, 
or get out of...

Playing the game involves exploration of the various levels, a bit 
of  puzzling out the levels,  and a fair bit of concentration  and 
dexterity  in  controlling GERALD.  SPINDIZZY WORLDS  successfully 
combines  all  three in just the right amounts,  and  the  concept 
works accordingly....

I think, time for the ratings......

GRAPHIX:-  86% - Successful updating of the original graphix,  and 
far more variety in what there is too see as well...

SONIX:-  67% - A token presence only,  a fairly good QUARTET title 
tune,  and standard spot effects,  this isn't a game which needs a 
pounding soundtrack though.....

PLYABILITY:-  90?  put  your  own % in - This is easily  the  best 
feature  of the game.  An excellent idea well implemented and very 
hard to beat...

OVERALL:- 89% - This is a great game both for short and  long-term 
players,  is  a  must buy as a rare original release in a  sea  of 
licences  just  before Christmas.

Finally, before I go, you are given the option of saving a game to 
disk, this is necessary, as you can't play all of SPINDIZZY WORLDS 
at once....
