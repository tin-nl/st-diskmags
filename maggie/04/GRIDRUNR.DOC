A review by Leon O'Reilly

Jeff Minter, is a dude, there is no denying that fact.
I remember him at the last PC show, on the Atari stand with a load 
of mega fours,  monitors and speakers.  He was having the time  of 
his life making circles in starfields. What an experience.
Jeff's games always have some element of originallity,  and  while 
never audio-visually stunning, they always play well.
Gridrunner  is no exception.  The concept is simple.  Gameplay  is 
maddeningly addictive.
The Earth is under attack!  The disgusting green Slimelords of the 
planet  Xtharrgg have unleashed heavily-armed fleets  against  the 
earth for no apparent reason!!  Luckily,  we just happen to have a 
few of the very latest Vorton Hyper X-13 UltraStarfighters  handy, 
but  there's  one problem...only one pilot is good enough  to  fly 
them...and  that's  you!  You  must go  into  battle  against  the 
Slimelords,  piloting the X-13 over incredibly realistic  abstract 
geometric  grids!  Can you vanquish the threat of  the  disgusting 
Slimelords  and  restore peace and prosperity to 320  X  200,  512 
colour galaxy? The fate of the universe is in your hands!
On  loading  up  you see a big sprite with lamas  on  it  bouncing 
around on a screen which tells you that all systems are go. Raster 
move up and down the screen.
The introductory sequence consists of the letters:
G R I D  R U N N E R
scrolling onto the screen. A nice note is also on this screen:
Yak sez "Mint sauce is murder, keep welsh sheep radioactive....... 
Ripoffs damage your karma."
Pressing a mouse button takes you to the level selector,  a useful 
and invaluable feature.  You don't have the boring and  impossible 
task  of starting right back at level 1 each time you play  a  new 
game, you just click on whichever level you want. 
The choice is tasty:
Level 1 - Easy for beginners!
Level 2 - Destroy them all!
Level 3 - Mind your ass!
Level 4 - Debug this, sunshine!
Level 5 - Portcullis (Zapfest!)
Level 6 - Revenge of the Pacpeople!
Level 7 - Death diagonals!
Level 8 - Crossfire!
Once you select your level you are treated to a digitised  picture 
of a llama. 
"WARNING EARTHSLIME!"
Then the action begins!
Your  ship  consists of two parts,  the body  and  the  detachable 
nosecone.  Both parts can move seperately and are controlled  with 
the mouse.
Moving the mouse about moves the body round the screen.  Press the 
right mouse button cause the nosecone to drift towards the body.
Pressing  the  left  mousebutton  causes both  the  body  and  the 
nosecone to fire. If you position the body behind the nosecone the 
firepower  is increased.  One shot enters the nosecone and  leaves 
as three shots. 
You can changes the direction this augemented firepower leaves the 
nosecone,  it can go vertically,  diagonally forward, horizontally 
or directly behind allowing you to effectively cover the whole  of 
the screen.
Gridrunner  is basically a shoot-em-up,  but a shoot-em-up with  a 
difference. The screen doesn't scroll for a start.
The  basic  aim  of  the game is to  destroy  all  aliens  without 
suffereing a hit to the body.  Not too original,  but the way it's 
executed is.
The sprites are tiny,  but move fast and smoothly. The backgrounds 
are colourful,  sometimes too colourful.  With  missiles,  aliens, 
bullets,  twirls and moving colours in the background sometimes it 
is almost impossible to see what is going on in the game.
Music is very low and bassy sounding.  Not very impressive, but it 
fits the game, just.

Overall,  this  is a classic game!  It starts off easy and as  you 
progress  gets  trickier  and trickier.  Some of  the  levels  are 
downright devious,  just when you think you've cleared a level,  a 
missile comes and shoots you up the bum. Grrrrrrrr!
The use of keyboard and mouse is an unusual way to control a game, 
but  it works well.  My mouse is very resposive (I got rid  of  my 
Atari one ages ago) so I'm very happy with this control method!
Gridrunner  is maddingly addictive.  you know you can  complete  a 
level if you concentrate just a little harder!  Its range of  pick 
up bonuses add interest,  rescue dropping llamas for bonus points, 
goats  give  you extra lives and yaks give  you  extra  firepower, 
shields give  you invulnrability, allowing you to shoot what looks 
like hob-knobs.
I  don't  know  if this game has very  much  lasting  appeal,  I'm 
already on level 7 of 8 but who cares when your having such  great 
fun.
Jeff C. Minter must be congratulated on an excellent game. At only 
œ10.95, who can afford to be without it?
One  question though,  what does the 'C' in Jeff C.  Minter  stand 
for?
