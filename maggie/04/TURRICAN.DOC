        Review by (C)IH   30.11.90


A  bit  of background first,  (Non-parallax...) THIS GAME WAS  NOT 
GOING TO APPEAR ON THE ST, YOU ARE UNDERGOING MAJOR HALLUCINATIONS 
IF  YOU ARE IN FACT PLAYING IT ON AN ST!!!!!!  Well actually  they 
did convert it to the ST in the end, and avoided committing one of 
the  big 'Crimes of the century' (Not converting good  proggys  to 
the ST.....)

Was  the end result worthy of Rainbow Arts,  well yes it certainly 
was,  as the first arcade game since Rainbow Islands which I could 
not put down..  As a result,  I am halfway through level 3, I have 
had to sell my house to pay my debts,  the Kids are on the street, 
etc,  etc,  (Actually,  this  is'nt  true,  it  is  what they call 
'Dramatic licence'!!!) 

Anyway,  to  the  plot!  (Oh  must you...........) such as it  is, 
Morgul,  evil  incarnate (But I thought she resigned from the Govt 
last week!  OOPS,,  little bit of politics!!) who is the master of 
all  fears  and  nightmares of mankind is back,  and  putting  the 
willies up mankind when it is in a dream-like state,  You will haf 
to excuse me,  but doing this bit of the review is sending me into 
a  catonic state.....   ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZ!!  It is up to you, 
Turrican, to put your power-armour suit on, and politely point out 
the error of Morguls ways,  preferably with something that makes a 
huge  bang,  and  a lot of messy stuff of Morgul..  Unfortunately, 
there are thirteen levels with over 1300 screens,  jam-packed with 
'nice  guy'  aliens,  and 'no trouble at all obstacles' and  'non-
fatal'  chasms  to negotiate B.M (NB 'B.M.'  -  before  Morgul...) 
Believe that if you like,  but be prepared against the contingency 
of a TEENY bit of trouble...

The  game  itself  superficially resembles  an  old  Hewson  game, 
EXOLON,   where  you  are  one  man-in-a-suit  against  a  hostile 
universe, however, the execution of the concept in Turrican is far 
superior... The playability is particularly excellent, even if you 
are  fairly  crap,  you  can  still get quite a  long  way  before 
expiring,  later on you realise how vast the playing area is, even 
on  the  'first  level.  Like all good games,  there are  tons  of 
bonus's,  powerups,  and  extra  lives,  if  you take the time  to 
explore the level thoroughly....  It is usually quite easy to find 
a  direct path through the levels,  but it is also worth exploring 
the hidden corners, and is a brilliant game for 'let's have a look 
for the hell of it' exploring...

Of what I have found so far, The first level is divided into three 
parts,  being a rocky background with dark caverns and waterfalls, 
alternating  with  a  tall  city,  there  are  two  end  of  level 
guardians,  the one you are guaranteed to meet, being a giant fist 
which zooms around the screen....  The second level,  you start by 
falling for several screens down a narrow shaft,  and you are into 
a  system  of  steel caverns,  so far,  ok?  then you come  across 
various  pools with armour-eating pirhana fish,  and a giant  fish 
for an end of level guardian. You then proceed through a dark, and 
vast  cavern in which it is qute difficult to stay alive  for  too 
long,  through  the latter part of this level to another EOLG (End 
of  level  etc etc...) and then you travel upwards,  and the  next 
part of the game is a scrolling shoot-em-up A LA Zenon II..

Regrettably as yet,  I have not got beyond here,  but you get the 
idea,  the  aliens  are mostly a pushover with the odd very  nasty 
one,  but there are plenty of them,  also, parts of the background 
are decidedly unfriendly, for example on the first level there are 
FIELDS  of spikes which shoot up your bot when you least need  it, 
and  a  large part of the gameplay involves getting  through  some 
tricky scenery...  Fortunately, this is not the sort of game which 
needs  pixel-perfect positioning and atomic-clock accuracy in  the 
timing  dept,  so  it  is a lot more playable than it  might  have 
been...

There  has been much praise of the programming skills involved  in 
Turrican,  and  I am not one to disagree with the general verdict, 
40-50 colours onscreen, 50 frames per second graphics, which don't 
make  for  a good game on their own,  but certainly make  the  job 
easier!!!    The  original  game  design  by  Manfred  Trenz,  and 
involvement  on  the ST version  including  Jochen  'Where-have-I-
heard-him-before??' Hippel and Sven Meier... So you get an idea of 
the  quality of the thing even before loading it.  It is musically 
excellent with a really good sample title tune (IF a little low on 
the  sample  KHZ ) and several MAD MAX tunes when in  the  game!!! 
What more do ya want??!?

Overall, it is a very good and extremely addictive arcade original 
(Don't see many non-licence arcade games these days!!) which  will 
need a cheat or infinite lives poke to complete it,  but you won't 
want to do this for a while yet...  Even better, Turrican II is on 
the way!!

Even if you don't normally bother with shoot-em-ups, this is one I 
can reccommend......

(you mean to say there aren't two 'c's in 'Recommend', Oh I see.)

A quick retrofit- Some ratings.......

GRAPHIX:- 91% - Super smooth 50 frames per second,  40-odd colours 
on  screen,  a  vast  range of subject matter,  so it doesn't  get 
monotonous,  the sheer amount of high quality work here (Did I see 
some overscan on the title screen?) make this a MUST...

SONIX:- 88% - A very good 4-channel sample,  (The Amiga original?) 
and  about  twenty top-of-the-range soundchip tunes,  by that  Rob 
Hubbard with a German Accent,  Jochen Hippel (Expect to be hearing 
these tunes in a demo near you soon ???)

PLAYABILITY:-  94% - Nearasdammit perfect...  How can they improve 
the game for Turrican II - I wait with bated breath...

OVERALL:-  94% - The sort of quality that ALL arcade games  should 
aspire to....

 And with that,, LETS WRRRAP!!!!!!!
