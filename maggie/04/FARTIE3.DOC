                 ...Written by Harvey Lodder...

     In our last chapter, we left Fartie at home with his Atari 
ST and Spectrum after having a nasty experience at a party which 
involved a girl, a flight of stairs and a broken front door. 
Anyway we now find Fartie at home and pretty depressed...

Everyone needs a holiday and that also includes boring people 
like Fartie. Everybody needs to go to a place were they can get 
away from everyday things that they come into contact with each 
and every day. In this case, Fartie has to get away from 
computers, 68000 machine code, videos and games. So were does he 
go? He goes to Butlins! That great holiday camp were everybody 
walks around in a perment state of being pissed, broke or usually 
both. So just to make this a bit more intresting, let's send 
Fartie on holiday with one of his mates, Brother Zenzen. Here 
follows a diary of their "great" holiday as told by Fartie...


     <<< THE SECRET DIARY OF SOMEONE WHO WENT TO BUTLINS >>>


SATURDAY 14TH JUNE

Well todays the day that me and Brother Zenzen go on holiday to 
Butlins. I'm sad to say that I'll be saying goodbye to my 
computers for a whole week, but I guess that they'll be waiting 
for me when I get home.

As I sit on the coach travelling to Butlins in Minehead, I wonder 
how I'll ever manage to spend my œ250 that I have put by in my 
bank account. This is the first time that I have ever been on a 
coach and I never knew that coaches had a coffee machine which is 
broken, a TV, a video, a bad tempered driver and a toilet that 
won't flush, installed for your pleasure during your journeys. If 
only London Transport would consider such things. My fellow 
tourist, Brother Zenzen has been very quite during this journey. 
I reakon that he's looking forward to going home so he can play 
on his computer.

We are now at Butlins! This place is amazing, you can queue for 2 
hours to get your key for your living quarters which resemble a 
small shed for two. This wouldn't be so bad, but the girl with 
the big tits gave us the shed which is at the other side of the 
holiday camp. We now have a very long walk with our very heavy 
cases - after all, we had to bring our computer magazines.

What an evening we had tonight. After unpacking our cases, 
eating our sandwiches that our mummys had made us (I had egg and 
salad cream and Brother Zenzen had peanut butter and jam), we 
read some of our back issues of Popular Computing Daily and had a 
few hours sleep before hitting the town at 7:45pm.

We visited a bar called "The Long-Beach". This is the first place 
that we found here and we plan to tour the rest of the camp 
tomorrow morning after morning breakfast. Here I brought a Coke 
and Brother Zenzen really pushed the boat out and had a Lager-
Shandy. I think that I may treat myself to a Lager-Shandy on my 
last night. At 9:15, I was really embarassed because I had to 
help Brother Zenzen up and guide him to the door because he felt 
sick and couldn'd finish his Lager-Shandy. This was made even 
worse by watching several people pointing and laugh at us. This 
is really embarassing, after all, me and Brother Zenzen are 18 
years old and adults. People who shouldn't be laughed at. I think 
we shall have to go to Bingo tomorrow night.

SUNDAY 15TH JUNE

Poor Brother Zenzen. He stayed in bed until 2:00pm surffering 
with a deep hangover. I called the holiday camp nurse out for 
him, but she got very pissed off and said some words that I never 
knew a woman could say. I think that if I had not been nursing my 
fellow buddie back to health who was in a delicate state, I would 
have told her to "Bugger Off". I must say that I wonder what 
breakfast was like, since I missed it looking after Brother 
Zenzen.

Me and Brother Zenzen have just finshed a tour of this camp. This 
place is amazing! There are arcades, bars (but we have decided to 
avoid these), fruit machines, cafes, the holy chapel, red coats, 
swimming pools and a place were you can cash your cheques.

Horror! I just had a very bad experince were I couldn't get any 
money from the place to cash cheques as it was a Sunday. Brother 
Zenzen only brought œ5 with him because he uses all his money to 
pay his H.P on his computer equipment. This means that we have no 
money until tomorrow and it's only 4:00.

Me and Brother Zenzen spent the night reading about computers. I 
discovered that you can get 4096 colours on an Atari! I can't 
wait to get home to see if this is really true. Roll on next 
week.

MONDAY 16TH JUNE

Oh wow! You should see some of the graphics on the arcade 
machines that me and Brither Zenzen have found. Brother Zenzen is 
having a very bad time at the moment and has decided to go home 
tomorrow. This is because he has no money and I don't have enough 
money to play on the fruit machines and to lend Brother Zenzen, 
never mind.

It's now bedtime and Brother Zenzen is getting really excited 
about going home to play on his computer. I am now really looking 
forward to going home now.

TUESDAY 17TH JUNE

Today Brother Zenzen went home. After a long discussion, I have 
decided to go home with him so we can play on our computers 
again. This is bloody brillant!

When we got home, our parents were surprised to see us. I never 
knew my parents could use such words. Still I know that they are 
really pleased to see me...

...Well it was nearly interesting, but not quite. If after the 
past three chapters you have decided that YOU are a computer 
fartie then write to me (address in last magazine), and I'll 
mention you in the next and final part of the life and times of a 
computer fartie.
