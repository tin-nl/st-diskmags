                         Trouble shooting                   by Mandrome

 -Help! Nothing works. 
  -Check whether you posses a computer.

 -I posses one, but I can't see a thing on the screen.
  -You're watching the back of the monitor.
  
 -Allright. Now I turned the computer on, but the screen remains black.
  -You turned it off instead. 
 
 -The computer is on now, but the screen's still black.  
  -Try taking off your sunglasses. 
 
 -Doesn't work. 
  -Try opening your eyes. 

 -Yes! But the screen tumbles.
  -You are watching your washing-machine.

 -Aaargh.. I am sure I'm looking at my monitor now, but the screen's all white.
  -Don't jerk you off in front of your monitor. 
 
 -I didn't. 
  -Insert a disk, Waldo! 
 
 -Nothing happens. 
  -You must have inserted it in a diskdrive alike object then (i.e.  
    your ass). 
 
 -Ok,but.. erm... I can't get it in the diskdrive. 
  -Turn the disk 90 degrees to the right. 
 
 -Ok, disk is in the drive... still nothing. 
  -Hmmmm... It must have been a 5,25inch disk which you folded a bit  
   so it would fit in the drive. The problem is that the hole is not  
   in the middle of the disk (the hole is a bit to big too). 
 
 -Well, a 3,5inch disk is in the drive...   nothing. 
  -Format it. 
 
 -Screep.. ssscreeep.. 
  -No! Not with your teeth. 
 
 -Ok, I formatted it, but there are no programs on it. 
  - ... 
 
 -He! Are you listening? 
  -... sigh... (burp). 
 
 -Ok, I'll take another disk. 
  -Hmmmm... seems braincell 13 has begun working. 
 
 -Look what I found! P-demo 2 by the MCA. 
  -NO! Little kiddies might be reading this. 
 
 -Mwoh.. So what? 
  -Don't do it. 
 
 -Yesyesyes. 
  -Nononono. 
 
 -Allright, which demo then? 
  -Take P-demo 1. 
 
 -The one with the cartoon? 
  -Yes. 
 
 -It won't load. 
  -WON'T LOAD??? 
 
 -No. 
  -Is this an old machine? 
 
 -No. 
  -Allright, it's TOS 1.4... screw the machine open. 
 
 -But there are no screws. 
  -There are..... on the bottom. 
 
 -Screwscrewscrew.. 
  -You screwed it! 
 
 -Yes, I did. 
  -Great, remove the cover. 
 
 -Let's screw this open. 
  -But that's the keyboard. 
 
 -So what? 
  -Yeah... so what. 
 
 -Quite a lot screws, eh? 
  -There's a screw loose! 
 
 (Plplploinggg... zzzzipp.. big mess: about 96 rubbers (no, not those)  
   are flying around.) 
 
 -Wawawhat was that? 
  -Err, that are the rubbers that were under the keys. 
 
 -Uh oh. 
  -Let's catch 'em.
