Reviewed by Stuart Bray.


Basketball,  Future style,  has sure changed from the game I  once 
played  at  school.   The  aim of getting the  ball  through  your 
oppositions  net still holds true but the  similarities  generally 
seem to stop there.   The reason for this is clearly explained  in 
this games opening screen.    



"Massive  long  term unemployment has led to psychosis  among  the 
redundant  millions.  (So the Tories got in again then.)   Violent 
crime has spiralled and data suggests that boredom played a  major 
part  in this.   A new form of telesat entertainment is  required, 
one that will vent anti-social behaviour........we have a solution
............FURTURE BASKETBALL."  (And there was me thinking  that 
Sky had already got this area sewn up, or is it B.S.B ,or B Sky B, 
or Sky B Bye B ? )



The playing surface,  for this violence quelling sport, is divided 
into  three  parts.   The central one of these forms  the  playing 
arena and this  is viewed directly from above.  Only approximately 
one  eighth  of the pitch is visable in this section  at  any  one 
time.  This is in itself compensated for by the presence of a full 
size view that appears in plan form and is superimposed in the top 
lefthand corner.  This displays the position of the players dotted 
within  the whole pitch and therefore allows your ball passing  to 
be  done  with  some degree of accuracy.   This  central  area  is 
flanked  by  two coloured blocks that each  display  the  relevant 
scores  and slowly deminishing time.   Control is by joystick  and 
the  game  offers either Human v Computer or  Two  player  option.  
Each side has five players apeice and you control only the  player 
designated as being closest to the ball.   The computer making you 
aware of this by pointing at this player with two small arrows.  




All  skills necessary for game play are quick and easy to  master.  
Collection  of  a loose ball is done by simply moving  to  it,  at 
which  point  your  man will claim it as his own  and  proceed  to 
bounce it.   You can then run around with the ball to your  hearts 
delight.   Winning  possession of the ball from the opposition  is 
where the real violence comes it.   What you do is aim your player 
at the guy holding the ball and then press your fire button.  This 
launches you directly at him with your fists out.   Following this 
rather  heavy contact,  the  previous ball owner will  be  knocked 
flying  whilst your immediate halt enables you to be  beneath  the 
ball as it lands in your waiting hands.  Great fun when your doing 
it to others but proves  annoying when its done to you.   After  a 
dazzling  show of skill in which you thundered the full length  of 
the pitch only to have some meat-head knock you arse over tit  can 
tend to piss you off alittle.   



I  personally recommend playing your first game on the two  player 
option,  with  no one controlling your  opponents,  thus  allowing 
alittle useful practise.   Attempting to beat the computer even on 
the easiest of its five difficulty levels can leave you feeling  a 
mite inept.  


But how did all these details string together into an actual game?  
Well  for me,  not so good.   The graphics were at best plain  and 
sufficient,  although scrolling was at all times smooth.  Also the 
colour  of  the pitch would change after each game and  some  were 
considerably better on the eyes than others.  And if only they had 
given  the option to enlarge the pitch that appeared in plan  form 
this would have helped.   e.g.  Kick Off.    The mastering of  the 
controls  proved easy after only a few games,  a point that  would 
seem in its favour but with this done there remained nothing  much 
more to do.   Sure, practice would have achieved continual wins in 
higher  levels  but  in the end it really didn't  seem  worth  the 
effort.   Even  with  the addition of exploding floor  panels  and 
power up pills the game lacked anything of real merit.   Therefore 
only  if you have money going very spare could I truely  recommend 
this game. Sorry.
