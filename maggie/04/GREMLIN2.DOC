
     GREMLINS II - The New Batch  (And the boring title...)
    ******************************(Sorry, I'm out of ideas)

Once  upon  a time,  there was a successful film about a bunch  of 
evil  little  shits,  who did their stuff after midnight,  and  in 
Blenders  (Remember  the famous blender sequence!!) The  film  was 
seen  as a huge hit!  and sometime later,  (Quite a while later..) 
Gremlins 2 - The New Batch (Son of the sequel etc,,) appeared. The 
film  itself got mixed reviews and dissapeared out of  the  cinema 
fairly  quickly,  whilst  ELITE got the licence for  the  computer 
game...

This is an all-formats 'pack-em-in jobbie,  how does it manage on 
the ST??...

The game loads in with an excellent animated sequence, of the cute 
Gremlin  peering out of a drawer (I forget the little  guy's  name 
for the minute..) You go to the game selection menu,  where you go 
to select no.  of players,  music on/off, and START THE GAME.. You 
are  immediately  struck by the decided averageness  of  the  game 
graphix, it's as though there were two separate development teams, 
one for the intro,  finish,  and title screens,  the other for the 
game....  Sound is a mixture of a rolling Chip-generated tune, and 
sampled spot effects taken from the film.....

In the game,  you travel from left to right,  zapping the Gremlins 
with your trusty Duracell-fuelled torch, and with anything you can 
pick up on the way,  such as Doughnuts (Are they Frisbees?!?!) and 
other  items,  you  go  through the level,  shooting and  avoiding 
Gremlins, which appear on pogo-sticks, Skateboards, the odd one on 
a rocket,  or  parachute,  (They  don't walk...) There  are  five 
levels,  each representing a part of the film (So they say...) but 
getting to the end is marginally less easy than curing the  Soviet 
union's economy, as the little buggers are ruthless and don't take 
any prisoners...

In  fact  this  is a slight problem  which  may  hinder  long-term 
enjoyment of this game, as it is very easy to meet a sudden death, 
and the game has a 'short' way with the player.... The programmers 
realised it was not too easy,  and gave the player nine lives, but 
you  are talking of about 900 lives to make any progress...  Added 
to which, the Gremlins have a habit of appearing randomly, when it 
is least convenient.... You die again, another game over.....

My  eyelids are drooping already,  it has been a long day at work, 
so on to the ratings....

GRAPHIX:-  76%  - Excellent opening title sequence,  high  quality 
stills (Funny how these film licences all seem to have this "Icing 
on  the  Cake") but somewhat averagely average game  graphix  I'm 
afraid....

SONIX:-  63%  - Our old friend 'Mr CHIP doing the  music  again, 
tunes adequate,  if not world-setting-alight quality, complemented 
by samples from the film...

PLAYABILITY:-  69%  - Let's be nice and say that this  is  a  game 
which needs persistence to master, on the other hand, I could have 
played  this for a longer time and be tearing my hair out by  now, 
who knows??

OVERALL:-  Hmmm?  - This is a typical film-licence tie-in sort  of 
game,  lacking  any  creative life of it's own..  A risky licence, 
which  I  think  will get fatally  stuck  inbetween  the  big-name 
licences  (Like  it  or not,  TURTLES are going to  be  NO.1  this 
XMAS..) and the better original releases.... Sorry.... Better luck 
next time guys!!!
