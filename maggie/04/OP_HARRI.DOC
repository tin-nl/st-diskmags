 Reviewed by Napoleon Bonaparte, I tell a lie, it's CIH again!

You  might recall I did a small review of ROTOX in the last  issue 
of  MAGGIE,  which  showed-off  the Rotoscape routines,  and  also 
advised  that there was a forthcoming release  OPERATION  HARRIER, 
which  utilised the same routines,  and that this might have  more 
possibilities than ROTOX,  well..... here it is, how does it look, 
we ask???

You  may well ask,  OP HARRIER indeed uses the self-same ROTOSCAPE 
routines,  but  this  time  you  are in a  Hawker  Harrier  V/STOL 
aircraft,  instead of an armoured spacesuit, and you have a number 
of  missions to complete,  in the time-honoured fashion of FALCON, 
F29, F19 etc.....

You  are  based on a light aircraft-carrier,  and you have to  fly 
over a large expanse of sea, and several islands, all of which is 
teeming with enemy ships and aircraft..  You are 'Briefed' by your 
Commanding  Officer,  the wonderfully named 'Colonel Mad' of  your 
mission objective.  'Briefing' is a barely adequate description of 
this  interesting  process,  as he grimaces,  bangs his fist,  and 
rolls  his  eyes,  and you begin to suspect the early stages of  a 
heart-attack or stroke are taking place... In my view the man must 
be  demented,  as he is actually wearing a naval uniform (?) Or is 
he an Airforce Colonel?? - please enlighten me....

You  go  on to the 'utility' screen,  where you can  bomb-up  your 
Harrier, and refuel and repair as necessary. This screen also gets 
you  a full-size map of the campaign area,  from which you try  to 
find your target.... This part of the game is quite well done, and 
gives it a more 'Simulatorish' feel...

So,  on  to  the  carrier flight-deck for the take-off,  which  is 
graphically  very  nicely done from  an  'Overhead  three-quarters 
viewpoint...'  At this point the overhead-view rotoscape  routines 
take over, and you are into the main body of the game....

You  are represented as a smallish Harrier-shaped sprite,  and are 
almost  immediately beset by enemy aircraft,  for which the answer 
is  a  good old stab at the firebutton to activate  the  cannon... 
They need a few shots to bring down, whilst you are progressing
towards  your  objective,  which  for the purposes  of  the  first 
mission   is  an  enemy  cruiser,   when  it  appears,   puffs  of 
antiaircraft  fire blossom around the ship,  and you have to  line 
up, err..  bombs away! Shit!! too late,,, And you've been hit, and 
you have flown too near an enemy intallation firing Surface-to-air 
missiles,  and you've been hit again.... With the alarms going and 
running  low  on fuel,  can you get back to the carrier ?  No,  you 
have  exploded,  -  cut to still graphic of hapless pilot  bobbing 
about  in  his  little  rubber dingy,  then back  to  base  for  a 
bollocking from Colonel Mad....  Three such bollockings later, your 
flying  career  is  finished,  and  you  are  handed  the  Latrine 
Detail... Don't laugh, it will probably happen to you...

Some nice touches,  the still between-scenes graphix are very well 
drawn,  there is a neat in-flight map, where you can see where you 
are  going,  and the tedious bits can be cut short if you hold the 
firebutton  down.  There  are  airfields where you  can  land  for 
emergency  repairs,  tanker  aircraft for in-flight refuelling  (I 
crashed  into  one!  )  and  more nasties than  you  can  shake  a 
Sidewinder at....

Onto the ratings.........

GRAPHIX:- 74% - Some nice inbetween sequences, the main Rotoscape-
driven   in-game   graphix  work  well  enough,   but  are   still 
uninspiring to look at....

SONIX:-   59%  -  A  reasonable  shortish  sample,   and   routine 
soundchipped in-game spot effects, nothing really special here..

PLAYABILITY:- 72% - Easy to get into,  but fairly tough to master, 
just try completing a mission to see what I mean...

OVERALL:-  72% - A competant enough game,  I have no strong  views 
either  way,  but as there are better games around,  I suggest you 
take a good look before buying....
