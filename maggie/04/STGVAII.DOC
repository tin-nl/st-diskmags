             The Return of Maulwurf (still alive ?)
                       by Oliver Wagner


- It is as dark as ...  well,  as night. Your head feels slightly 
  the worse for wear and you notice one  or two bumps  rising  on 
  your  forehead (remember the truncheon).   Quickly as all  good     
  swiss nationals would do you check your inventory and notice to     
  your  despair, that  you have nothing left but the  diskbox and     
  contents. Although  this seems to be a piece of luck, it  is  a     
  further indicator, that the swiss (in Geneva) have no  use  for     
  Atari ST disks (probably still in the 5« inch age or even worse     
  the  one   with  the data cassettes). You slip  one  more notch     
  towards committing suicide (Mandatory Suicide,that is).

- Search room
  
  There's nothing of interest.

- Search room again, you idiot !
  
  I don't understand idiot

- Search  room again,  you motherfucking bastard  of  incompetent 
  piece of chips. 
  
  There's no need to use foul language.  There's still nothing of 
  interest here... but wait! The sun which shines through a small 
  opening in the roof reflects upon a piece of shining METAL.

- Examine METAL !
 
  It turns out  to be a "Walkman" (N.B.no copyright  infringement   
  meant, Sony!)

- Listen to tape

  You  press  the  start  button  and  the  delicate  and  rather 
  aggressive  sound of SLAYER'S "Reign in Blood" courses  through 
  your  ear and causes a slight distortion on your  eardrums.  As 
  you continue listening,  you try to figure out why you're  here 
  and how to get out.  You are by no means CRIMINALLY INSANE, nor 
  are  you causing an EPIDEMIC.  You could try to exit  PIECE  BY 
  PIECE,  although this is not recommended by the  author.  While 
  listening to "Altars of Sacrifice",  you suddenly remember your 
  christian ties and remind  yourself of a verse in the  bible  : 
  JESUS SAVES,  through him you will be REBORN (not if you are an 
  ANGEL OF DEATH of course).  Since you have to be in a state  of 
  advanced  putrification to be REBORN,  let's hope it will  only   
  happen after you have lived your due time and repaid  all  that   
  humanity has given you (no ST's in Geneva, though). 

N.B. Well, well, well ! Got carried away again. I just can't help 
     it.  After this lenghthy and absolutely necessary tribute to 
        the best thrasher's around, I must deny all accusals :
                     NO, I'M NOT PAID BY SLAYER          
     (though  I  thoroughly  anticipate  their  newest  album   : 
                      "Seasons in the Abyss"
                       Everybody got that ? 
                          It's called :
                      "SEASONS IN THE ABYSS")


- Suddenly the batteries die on you and thoroughly pissed off you 
  throw the noise-maker into a dark and foreboding corner. 
  You are feeling audacious !!!(hint, hint)

- Right,  computer,  as I'm feeling audacious right now  :  enter 
  dark corner.

  Thanks,  pal.  You find yourself in a dark passageway (N.B. and 
  before any of you shout out liar or some other obscenity I dare 
  not  mention in this  puritanistic mag,  this passageway really   
  exists. I've been there (map:look "rue de Perron" and  "rue  de   
  BarriŠres" in the old  part of town)).  Well  anyway, you  make   
  your way along the passageway and stumble. Oh no, you might say   
  right  now, but actually it turns out to be a piece of luck (oh   
  boy,  daft people must always have all the luck (N.B. remember, 
  I  am  talking about   Maulwurf)).  One  of  the  "Professor's" 
  henchman  has   entered the passageway and is presently  trying    
  to kill you (why exactly  in this moment,  when he has had time 
  to  do  so during the hours you where unconscious  remains  one 
  more  question which  will not be answered  in  this  adventure 
  (N.B. I've run out of fantasy there, sorry). What next ?

- Show inventory

  Looks rather sad : a diskbox 
                     the diskbox contains : a few disks 
                     one disk contains :  the "LOST BOYS 
                                               MINDBOMB DEMO"
  What next ?

- Dumb question ! Run like hell !!!!

  I can run like a rabbit, but "like hell" I can't. 

- Get out of here !!!!!!

  After stumbling again and again you eventually find an exit and 
  you are standing on "rue de BarriŠres". It is bright afternoon.

- Go north
 
  You find yourself facing the "Temple de la Madelaine".

- Enter  Temple  (N.B.  If you  find yourself wondering  what  in 
  heaven's name churches  have in common with Atari ST's keep  on 
  reading and wondering. Everything is possible in my adventure).

  You  are  astonished by the grandeur and  complexity  of  this 
  ancient architectural masterpiece : it has four walls 

- Search Temple

  There's nothing of interest here and  even if you ask me again, 
  there will still be nothing,  so there!  A priest is asking you 
  to leave frindly but firmly.  You decide to leave,  since he is 
  brandishing  a large and  rusty dagger,  probably  dating  from 
  around the 13th century. 
  You  are  now outside  the temple (N.B.  Well,  I  must  say  I 
  underestimated you. There really is no connection between church 
  and  ST (maybe  I meant SainT  Michaels  (sorry,  private  joke 
  (giggle, giggle))).
 
- Go north 

  You have crossed the main shopping road under peril of life and 
  are now standing on "place de Longemalle",  waiting for the sky 
  to come tumbling  down,  which of course it  doesn't.  You  can 
  savely remove your hands from the top of your head now.

- Go north-west

  You  are now standing in front of the ferry stop,  where  every 
  ten  minutes  there is a small  motor  boat  which  brings  you 
  directly to the other shore, unless there happens to be a leak, 
  which of  course hasn't happened in the last two or even  three 
  weeks, so there's nothing to worry about, is there ? 

- Buy ticket
 
  You think you are smart, are you. Don't want to be caught again   
  with your pants down (N.B.  figure of speech !)again.  But what 
  do you want to do about this : Buy ticket with what ????

- Steal ticket 

  You are  not in the "Guild of Thieves" (N.B.  Now where have  I 
  heard this one before).

- Beg for ticket

  "Bugger off",  the man says  in fluent French which  you  don't 
  understand, so you thank the man, take the ticket and before he  
  can  say  "supercallyfrajelisticexpialledotious  (or  something 
  like  that in French) you  have boarded the boat and  cast  off 
  (N.B. the man is quite flabbergasted, you see!).

- Wait 

  Nothing happens

- Wait 

  As the soap used to fill a hole in the bottom of the boat  gets    
  wet and  turns  all  mushy it slithers  out  of  it's  supposed   
  place and reveals a hole about the size of your thumbnail.  The 
  boat begins to fill with water.

- Wait 

  The boat continues to fill with water

- Say "MAYDAY"

  No  one hears you.  The captain has left the boat at the  first 
  sign of danger.  So have the rats. You shouldn't have waited as 
  long as you did.  Bad luck.  The boat sinks and takes you  down 
  into the dark depth of lake Geneva.
  You  notice  a sort of  blackness  surrounding  your  head  and 
  suddenly  you  realize that your eyes  are  closed.  You  force 
  yourself to open them and cold,  industry-polluted water  crush 
  in on your eyes. You notice something  yellow glittering in the 
  slimy bottom of the ferry and something grey  which  you  can't 
  quite make out in  the gloominess  which prevails on the bottom
  of the lake. 

- Examine yellow thing

  It's not a  thing but a box which says on it :  "Use only  when 
  the piece of soap gets wet and turns all mushy and slithers out 
  of the thumbnail-sized hole. For everything you take out please 
  leave a receipt."

- Open box 
 
  The open box reveals some scubadiving equipment. 

- Take equipment and wear it

  You put on the equipment (N.B.  Off course it slipped my  mind. 
  You are a brilliant scuba-diver with years of  experience.  How 
  else  could  you handle this situation,  without  panicking and 
  trying to get the oxygen supply to work without wriggling  with 
  clumsy fingers).  You switch on the  lamp  which has also  been 
  kindly supplied by a local  bank (it says so in BIG fluorescent  
  letters, so you can read it in the dark). 

- Down

  Are you sure you want to do this ? Type in YES or NO

- Yes
 
  You  lamp slides  along the greenish bottom and  stops  on  the 
  greyish thing you saw from above.  It reminds you of  something 
  but you can't quite remember of what. 

- Examine grey thing 
 
  It turns out to be the sad remains of an Atari ST 1040. This is 
  enough  even for you.  Your last self respect crumbles  as  you 
  grab for the battered ST and don't even mind when a  fingernail 
  cracks (gosh !!).  What bothers you though is the difficulty in 
  breathing  properly all over sudden. Is it all this  excitement 
  over finding the remaining BITS and pieces ?  No,  it's not  as 
  bad as all that.  It's only your oxygen supply running short  a 
  bit.  You will only suffocate very  slowly.  Nothing  to  worry 
  about.  You  are  I  presume   still   too  shattered  by  your 
  experience to care about continuing to live. Enter YES or NO. 

- Yes ...  wait, hold all horses. I will avenge all mistreated ST 
  and as the "GREY CAPED COMPUTER FREAK" I shall be known to all.

  N.B. You must  excuse his (Maulwurf's who is playing) emotional 
  outburst of megalomania,  but his rather sensitive little brain 
  has been severely damaged by this awful happening.  He needs  a 
  lot of understanding  right now. Just play along with him for a 
  while. 
   

  What will happen to our disturbed friend, who is suffering from 
  oxygen shortage  at the bottom of the lake right now,  we  will 
  see in "DISK MAGGIE ISSUE # 3",  so don't despair. I can assure 
  you that you will be as  bored as you were in this part and  as 
  you were in the first. So  to all those (I can count them  with 
  my fingers) out  there who are still eagerly  anticipating  the 
  return  of Maulwurf here's a hint :  he will live  and  return 
  (maybe) in some other story of DISK MAGGIE (how exiting!!!).
          
   Till then, farewell 
              
                       from 
                          
                            the "BOREMASTER"
                                  (O.W.)
