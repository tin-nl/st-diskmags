                              REVIEWED BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

     Hello there, please excuse that this article is rather short 
but  we only received the game a few days before Maggie  4.0  was 
due to be released.  At this point I would like to say a  special 
thanks to Marc Rosocha for giving us an original. 

     Wings of Death is probably the best shoot-em up game  around 
at the moment. Some say that it is better than Xenon and some say 
it isn't !  It's up to you to decide, I personally think that the 
two  games cannot be placed in the same category.  Wing of  Death 
persues a completely different style. 

     The  game comes on two discs and runs on any  computer.  The 
firts disc mainly contains the Thalion intro which is followed by 
an Eclipse logo (the game was developped by Eclipse and then sold 
by  Thalion,  if  you want to know more about  this  new  company 
called  Eclipse  write  to us or look for more  info  in  another 
articles). 

     The  graphics throughout the entire game are drawn by  Erik, 
the  undrownable  monster  (for more info on this  read  ST  NEWS 
STNICCC  article).  I could say nothing bad about the graffix  in 
the game as they are just marvellous.  To give you an  impression 
what  the graphics are like I will try to describe the  first  of 
many spectrum pictures to you. A dragon, with expanded red wings, 
is  breathing fire on some burned creature in the middle  of  the 
screen.  All  in  all the scenery takes place somewhere  in  your 
brain,  everything is fictional, a castle towers on a mountain in 
the background with some blueish faces looking at it.  

     To  continue  to the next screen you simply have  to  hit  a 
key. This screen contains one of the best 4 track sampled tunes I 
have  ever heard in my entire life.  The drumline is great  along 
with the creepy sampled voice saying WINGS OF DEATH. On screen is 
the logo of a dragon with a head pointing to the left and to  the 
right with some enormous wings.  At the bottom of the screen  you 
are informed who did what in the game and whatever else you would 
like to know.

     After  you have seen all this you are asked to  insert  disc 
two to start the game. Throughout the entire game there will be a 
sampled tune with a voice telling you what is going on.  When you 
then  start the game a nice tune by Jochen Hippel with a  sampled 
drum line will be your companion.  The voice during the game play 
is  by  Tim  Moss  alias Manikin of the Lost  Boys  (it  is  very 
doubtful  that you will recognize it).  The actual game  play  is 
superb,  millions  of  enemies are buzzing around on  the  screen 
firing  at you.  The sprites aren't as so often always  the  same 
size,  here they vary from very large to tiny sprites.  While you 
are flying about shooting baby dragons you can pick up  different 
weapons  some  of which are better and some of which  are  worse.  
The  control  is  very easy too,  it responds very  well  to  the 
joystick movements.  

     The  game has 7 or 8 (I'm not quite sure now)  stages  which 
are  getting  better  and better by the moment.  I  was  told  by 
friends  of mine that they found the game so addictive that  they 
finished  it in less than a day,  which might also say  something 
bad about the game. Some people might say that it's not its money 
worth when you finish it so quickly (let me tell you  otherwise). 
I agree with the people saying that it is very easy to finish but 
this  is only due to the many extra lives which you can  pick  up 
throughout the game.

     For  the people who still have some problems with the  game, 
here's  the cheat code :  ST FOREVER.  When you then start a  new 
game  you  can select in which level you want to start  the  next 
game.

A quick summary:

------------------------------------------------
Overall                       : 9.4

I  personally would vote this game here the game of  this  months 
issue.  Great game Marc,  I hope that you will do many more games 
in future !

For all the fans of Wings of Death,  I think that I should inform 
you  that Marc is thinking of doing a follow up game to Wings  of 
Death which will hopefully come out quite soon !
