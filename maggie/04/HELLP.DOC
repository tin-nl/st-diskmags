     
     WHATEVER HAPPENED TO?????..........

I  am  planning a new section for Maggie  in  forthcoming  issues, 
which  will deal with the very interesting question,  of  whatever 
happened to the likes of 'Dick Special',  'EPT', Dynamic Debugger, 
to name but a few.....

These  were in the category of most keenly awaited  releases,  but 
have   quietly  disappeared  for  a  variety  of  technical,   and 
'political' reasons....

On the current software casualty list are:-

DICK  SPECIAL,  (Rainbird)  EPT,  (Also Rainbird),  TERRANIUM,  and 
CRIMETOWN DEPTHS (Mirrorsoft),  DYNAMIC DEBUGGER (I forget who was 
doing this...)

There  are  no  doubt  other similar "Land  of  the  Living  Dead" 
software packages....

I  also would appreciate news on the following,  which as far as I 
know,  are still 'alive' Where is ELITE II,  is David Braben still 
going??  Where is RAMROD,  by Gremlin?  and also the Argonaut Mega 
flight-sim,  AGRESSOR,  or  HAWK  (or  whatever it's called  these 
days..)

Finally, the list I have given is only an example, if you have any 
further additions to it, then write in....

  Wait hearing from you, CIH....
