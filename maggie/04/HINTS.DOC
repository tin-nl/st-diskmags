What is Megatips?
Megatips will be part of a new PD minizine, available in December.
Megatips will form the bulk of this magazine, and will be a 
constantly updated file full of cheat modes, tips, pokes and
complete solutions to hundreds of ST games.
If you know any tips or cheats for any games which isn't featured
in the following pages then don't hesistate to send it to me.
You can send them in to me on paper or on disk (ASCII or 1st word
format please.) If you do send me a disk then I'll copy you the
latest version of Megatips free. (Cor blimey!)
Megatips will be a huge database, it will be the biggest selection
of tips ever seen on any computer, but I need your help to complete
it. My adress can be found at the end of the article.
If any of these cheats don't appear to work, or I've typed passwords
wrong contact me to. I'm also looking for contacts to swap PD
software and Demos with.
As well as Megatips, all the latest and best Tips will be featured 
in future issues of Maggie.
