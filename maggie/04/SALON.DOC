                             Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     Well,  here  we  for again with the first  demo  review  for 
Maggie 4. The Salon de Micro Demo, or short SMD Demo, was written 
for a computer which took place in Paris some time back (See last 
issue  for the Show Report).  The disk is on a double sided  disk 
and runs on any ST, even the STE.

     After  I  inserted  the disk a  digitized  Overlanders  logo 
appeared  for a short time on the screen.  A short  while   after 
that  samples  begin  to  play  (this  might  be  a  more   track 
sample  player,  but  I  could not be sure as my  speaker  on  my 
television blew the other day!   Anyway,  there is a normal sized 
srolline  at the bottom of the screen informing you that the  SMD 
demo  is  loading.  To  fill the rest of the screen  there  is  a 
picture  of one of the Iron Maiden album covers!  The picture  is 
from the album Wasted Years ! 

     Grrrgg,  grrrrg,  the disk drive light flashes one last time 
and the demo gets on its ways.  As this demo was only written for 
the show there are no other screens apart from the one which I am 
about  to  describe to you !  You can find an  average  piece  of 
graffix in the bottom border saying Overlanders.  In the opposite 
direction,  the top border,   is a scrolline going from the right 
to the left of the screen (it would have been quite stupid if  it 
had  moved the other way !!).  The middle of the screen has  been 
devided up into 2 areas, the left and the right. On the Left side 
is  some text saying " You can't beat the feeling !" bouncing  up 
and down.  Do you remember this phrase from some TV advert, well, 
let  me  give  you a little hit,  it has  something  to  do  with 
drinking  and  the drink which is mostly bought at  any  computer 
copy  party or conference !  On the right side of the screen  are 
some  digitized  pictures  fading  in  and  out  using  different 
techniques some of which look quite nice.  I bet you wonder  what 
the hell is portrayed on the pictures ?!?  I do not really  know, 
but  I can assure you that it's not the  programmers,  or,  well, 
ahh,  yes  it is,  they are simply in disguise,  STAN looks  like 
Madonna, Dogue like Donald Duck and Ziggy like Daisy.  To top the 
demo  off  some  sprites fly about in some  rather  strange  wave 
forms.   Some  colourbars  are  also  in  the  sprites,  are  you 
interested  what the sprites say ?  I am not going to  tell  you, 
but  you  can  find it out by buying it from  the  Lost  Boys  PD 
library.

     When you hit the reset button you are about to find out what 
any programmers favourite drink is,  it is red and white, it Coca 
Cola!  Writing  all this made be quite thirsty,  I'll think  I'll 
just pop round to the Off-license to get a few bottles. 

     Bloody hell, it's freezing outside. I would not be surprised 
if it is going to snow today.

The Summary for the people who have not fallen asleep yet.

Overall                       : 6.7

     Even if the impression you get from the Overall result  does 
not sound too good I can assure you that this demo should not  be 
missed out in your Overlanders Demo collection.
     
     At  this point here I would like to talk about giving  marks 
to demos etc...  First of all let me tell you that I do not  like 
doing this too much, because there is always going to be somebody 
who feels that I have treated him unfair.  I am sure that this is 
quite  possible,  but  for  example  I do  not  know  under  what 
circumstances the demo was written.  It might have been that this 
person only had one day to code it and for that time it would  be 
a marvellous piece of code.  So,  I hope that you can  understand 
the problems that I have got better.

               Thanks for your understanding.....
