                         KICK OFF 2 TIPS

BY Leon O'Reilly

Everyones raving about this Kick Off 2 game,  so you decide to buy 
it.  You  boot  it up and ages later the intro  and  menu  screens 
appear.  You put it onto single game and you hear what sounds like 
someone  blowing down a phone,  but its supposed to be  the  crowd 
cheering.  Shit sound you think to yourself. The little footballer 
sprites  appear  running over each other making an  awful  looking 
sprite clash on the screen. Shit graphics you think to yourself.
You  start playing and you can't control the ball let alone  shoot 
at goal. You commit suicide at your incompetence.
Except  you don't 'cos here are the tips from someone  who's  been 
playing Kick Off for ten months.

Always  put  aftertouch  on as it is a lot easier  to  score  with 
aftertouch.
When playing the league,  put all the teams onto joystick control, 
including the one you want to be-say you want to be Sweden. Change 
all the other teams apart from Sweden as so:
Change  the  number on the keepers to 9 and 10 (And 11  if  theres 
three keepers). 
Change  the numbers on the forwards to 1, 2, 3, 4, and if possible 
5 and 6.
Change the defenders to 7, 8 and 11 (If a keeper isn't already 11)
Put the subs 12 and 14 as defenders.
So the team has a forward in goal, its defenders are forwards, its 
midfielders are defenders and its forwards are goalkeepers!
Once you've changed all the teams,  put all teams apart from  your 
team to computer controlled. 
Now  play  the  league  as  normal  and  you  should  thrash   all 
opposition!

Onto single game. Make sure you have a lenient referee, and in the 
first  half  foul like hell.  If one of the  opposing  players  is 
injured,  wait  for  him  to  start running  off  and  before  the 
substitute  comes on press escape.  You will now be at half  time. 
Choose continue - You will still have the same amount of time left 
but the opposition will be down to ten men!

If  you are playing against a lower division team then you  should 
always score with this method:
From  kick off run straight up through all the opposition  players 
and  as soon as you get into the penalty area press fire  then tug 
right to curl the ball. It should always find the back of the net!
Practise this using practice mode!

To  score a quick goal,  pass the ball back to your  goalie.  Make 
sure  he  is  standing in front of goal (Not at the  edge  of  the 
penalty  area.  Push up and fire.  The ball will hurtle  down  the 
field.  Chase after it with your players and press fire to head it 
to the ground.  You have to be quick but if you time it right  you 
should  get the ball into the penalty area and be able to curl  it 
round the advancing keeper.

Another  way to score is to run up into the middle of the  penalty 
area and hold the ball (By holding down fire). As the goalie comes 
out  let go of fire and the ball will go right past him  into  the 
net.

The  most effective way of scoring is to run up the middle of the 
pitch  and  to push the ball into the penalty area. Stop, then run 
at the ball, strike it then curl it. You should score 90% of the 
time with this method  but you must be quick and get away from  
defenders making sure none are in the box or they'll clear the ball 
before you hit it.

Another  good way to score is to run into one side of the  penalty 
area  with the ball.  Hold it and the goalie will  advance  toward 
you.  When  he  gets near pass the ball into the  middle  where  a 
striker can blast the ball into an unprotected net.

Always  curl  the ball when you shoot because even if  the  goalie 
does  reach  the ball he may not be able to hold  onto  the  ball. 
After you've shot run in toward the goal and blast in any rebounds 
off the keeper.

Penalties are tricky. (But not as hard as player manager)
Shooting- You mustn't hold down the fire button otherwise the ball 
will go to high over the bar. Tap the firebutton as lightly as you 
can.
The  best time to shoot is to wait for the arrow to  start  coming 
from the left and just before it reaches the middle of the  screen 
tap fire.
Saving - Wait for the player to shoot the ball and as soon as  the 
ball starts moving press R. You will now get a replay (Press S for 
slow motion) You can now see which way the ball is going so  push 
your joystick that way and hold down fire.

The  best  way to tackle someone if you are in a  higher  division 
then them is to run right through them. They will fall flat on the 
floor and the referee will never see this as a foul.

If you want a penalty stand in the penalty area and hold the  ball 
and wait for someone to tackle you!!!
Anywhere  on  the pitch,  if a player misses you  with  a  sliding 
tackle run over his leg and you'll get a free kick and the  player 
may get a card!

Bugs:
KO2 is full of bugs, but is not quite as bug-ridden as KO1. Here
are some of my favourite bugs:
Corners - All the players go to one end of the pitch, then the 
corner is taken from the other end of the pitch!
Goal Keeper slowdown - If you score too many goals your keep some-
times slows down and walks very slowly when taking kicks. This 
gets worse and the keeper sometimes walks into his own goal then
the game crashes.
Subsitute Crash - KO2 sometimes crashes when you've pressed F4 or 
F5 then the ball goes out of play.
Throw ins - Throw ins and corners often seem to be given to the 
wrong team. I don't know whether this is a bug or the ref needs
glasses.

Despite these bugs, KO2 is probably the most enjoyable game ever.
My best tip: If you haven't got this megagame, buy it now!
