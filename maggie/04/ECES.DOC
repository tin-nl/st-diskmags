                   An Alternative look at the
          The European Computer Entertainment Show

By Leon O'Reilly.

It is exactly a week before the show and I'm reading the ST Format
I just bought. "The TCB tracker. 4 channel sound only using 28%
processor time. Released by An Cool at the ECES."
Wow. An Cool will be there. I've got to go to meet this great guy.
I phone Dylan (Weird Amiga owner with tuns of dosh).
"Lets go to the ECES."
"OK"
"Bye"
(Our phone conversations are extremely exciting)
The next day I persuade Chris (Another Amiga owner) to come. (To the
show I mean).
It's too late to order tickets, but we'll risk Queueing.
On Friday I go round to Dylans and get bored with his Amiga demos
which I've seen 400 times before and aren't a patch on Mindbomb so
I end up playing on his brother's STE (Brilliant!).

I wake up at 5:25 Saturday morning and get ready for the big show.
We're driven down to Newtown station and we pass Aled (Another weird
Amiga owner). We sit at the station and wait. No sign of Chris. Where
is he? Eventually he turns up two minutes before the train is due.
The train pulls in. Dylans mum says:
"Don't let Dylan throw his sandwiches out of the window."
My and Chris look bewildered but say we'll refrain him from
such actions.
We get on and sit round a table. I rant on about An Cool. Some chap 
comes round saying "Tickets please." We all buy half fares, Dylan 
huddles up and tries to look young (He's about seven feet high). It 
works!
At Shrewsbury a lot of rowdy passengers get on. A family sit on
the seat behind us. (Behind the seat Dylan is sitting on).
A three year old girl starts shouting and pointing out the window.
"Trees"
"Grass"
"Cow" 
"hehehehehe"
This girl is now standing on her seat. She leans over and sees Dylan.
"Funny!"
She starts running her hands through Dylans hair.
Then she decides its more fun to hit him so she starts slapping him
about the head. Me and Chris are creased up laughing. Dylans face
is purple with anger.
Four hours and five thousand slaps later we arrive in London.
We get off trying to walk on our dead legs. From our carriage to the
doors at the end of the station seems like miles.
I point everyone in the right direction for the Underground, though
Dylan thinks the enterance is in the Sock Shop (!!!).
We get on a tube.
We realise its the wrong tube, but at least its going the right way.
We get off and get on another tube.
Its the wrong tube going the wrong way.
We get off again and get on the right tube at last.
We step off at Earls court and go out through the wrong exit meaning
we have to run round the block.
Then we see it, the queue. It goes for miles! We get in and our 
hearts sink.
"I knew we should've bought tickets"
"You should have told me about this earlier"
"Its your fault, you were going to order them!"
Blah blah blah. We are thoroughly depressed. One good thing is we
see that Aled is way back in the queue behind us. We give him a 
freindly wave (Haw haw).
After queing for half an hour we start getting bored. I suggest 
giving everyone a history of the Carebears to cheer them up but they
all threaten to knock all my teeth out if I just mention An Cool.
A nice security guard with an American chin comes round telling us
the hall is full and they're letting people in every ten minutes.
I watch with envious eyes people coming out of the show clutching
magazines, leaflets, bags full of software and printers.
Chris suggests we start a riot. (Full of good ideas is our Chris.)
An hour later we've moved round to the other side of the fence.
The guard says they will let in 1000 people then close the doors
for 4 hours and as there are over 1000 people in front of us we won't
get in for four hours. Time for evasive action.
In front of us pushing through the queue is a big black STe owner who
you'd only tangle with using nuclear weapons. We hid behind and sneaked
up the queue about 100 places and eventually got in! I nearly had an
orgasm! We were actually in! We'd debated spending the day going
round the shops in London (Dylan wanted to go to Harrods). But now we
were there! We got our tickets (œ5 for a piece of card!) and went up
the stairs.
Choke city! Inside it was very claustrophobic, in some corridors you
could hardly breathe let alone move. I made straight for stand D5 
while Chris went looking for some games and Dylan went looking for
a Gen-Lock. 
I found D5 and thought 'what's that great music'. I saw two big TV
screens with speakers attached to them blaring out TCB Tracker music.
In the centre of this stand sat An Cool wearing a white T-Shirt
saying 'An-Cool'. He looked very Swedish, tall, blond hair and a 
big spot on his nose!
Sitting beside him was Hi-Tech of the dynamic duo showing off his
Superior demo. I liked what I saw of it, the bird screen and the 
vector screen. Anders was nodding and pressing space. I said
"I've got the Demon Demo" To Hi-Tech.
"That was our first one" Says Hi-Tech.
End of conversation.
Looking round the stand was swarming with all the best demo-coders.
I didn't recognise them everyone, but those I did were Shadow of the
Dynamic Duo, Phantom, Count Zero and Sammy Joe!
I saw a weird looking bloke with a big nose and a weird haircut (I seem
to remember thats what he looked like.) He was chatting to some other
ST Dude. (Brackets indicated my translation)
"I'm Sprog. I used to be in the Lost boys." (Before they were any good)
"What happened?"
"I left." (They chucked me out)
"What do you do now?"
"I play the guitar in a band" (Bugger all)
After having a hard stare from Count Zero (Or was it the phantom) anyway
it was the ugly fat one with the leather jacket. I decide to move on.
Most of the other stands are shit, just people flogging software
"4 ST games for 20 quid, you can't get cheaper than that guv."
I met up with my friends at the eating-hole. (I refuse to call it a
restaurant.) Chris had bought the game Wings, Dylan had bought nothing.
He'd picked up three bags full of leaflets.
"I need them for work"
He'd gone to every stand and picked up a wad of their leaflets. Some
people didn't look very pleased at this robbery of free adverts.
Chris had also bought a powerplay cruiser joystick for œ6.99.
I decide this was a good buy as I've buggered up three joysticks
and on my existing ones the fire buttons are very dodgy.
I find the powerplay stand and buy a nice multi-coloured cruiser.
Then I head for the 16/32 bit PDL. Nick Harlow is busy chatting to
Hi-tech when I get there. I pick up one of their catalogues but it is
quite old and has little new stuff. 
"Have you got any new stuff?"
"I've got the new Lost Boys demo."
"I've got Mindbomb" I say.
"No, they've bought out a new one after that!"
Great, I'll get it. I bought:
SUPERIOR DEMO - Good multi-screen demo
LIFE'S A BITCH - Brilliant little demo, the 3D vectors are some of the
                 fastest I've seen, ULM's scroller outdoes TCB's one on
                 the Cuddly Demos and the samples are well disgusting.
TEC V8 EMPIRE - Nice demo with great intro music. Well worth getting
                though it tends to bomb out a lot!
NOISETRACKER - Good soundtracker player with an excellent soundtracker
               creation program. Get it toddie!
SWEDISH NEW YEAR DEMO 2 - Miles better than the first one. F3 is brill,
                          An Cool's screen is good, Sync fullscreen is
                          very good but TLB's 3D balls piss on Sync's
                          vectorballs, even though Syncs music is better.
After getting these mouth watering demos I head back over to stand D5.
An Cool and loads of other chaps are crowded round another demo, the
Inner Circle decade demo, and well impressive it is too. You guide a
little droid about and go behind doors, and behind each one is a 
different screen (original huh?). The screens are very good. Nice 
vectors and tons of other effects including a great Quartet screen
with music converted from demos and games. These tunes were sounded
great especially through An Cool's hi-fi. I was surprised to see ST-Squad
had made a screen and it wasn't a sample demo (Shock horror!). 
The depacker was very slow unfortunately, though one of the Inner Circle
chaps reckoned:
"This packer pisses on all other packers. It takes them out to the pub,
buys them a drink and then takes them home." !!!!!!!
I went to the counter and the knowledgable MPH boss was chatting to the
punters about demo crews. Mad Max is very expensive to hire he says. 
He starts talking about TCB and Tanis and how there all in university
and how amazingly good programmers they are.
"Most programmers get stuck and have to look at the manual, but these
guys just scratch their heads and carry on."
I decide to buy a TCB Tracker as it's an essential fashion item.(!!!!)
I part with 40 big ones less fivepence for a box, a book and a disk.
I turn round and there is Chris.
"Hey Chris there's that An Cool chap I keep talking about all the time."
"That ugly git in the green jumper?" Retorts Chris.
"Yes except its not a jumper its a sweatshirt." 
For the rest of the day Chris complains about An Cool's green jumper.
We then go to the STampede stand. I buy the back issue with Mr Heli
on it and Chris buys a back issue with dark side on it.
We meet up with Dylan and he has now five carrier bags full of leaflets.
Its now time to go and Dylan forces us to carry a bag of leaflets each
across London.
We have a food binge and buy cheeseburgers, chips and cokes then climb
on our train. "The Cambrian Coast Express".
Dylan decides he's not hungry and scatters the floor with chips, a half
eaten cheeseburger and then he sprays coke everywhere.
At Birmingham we have to change. We get off and as we have to wait 
three quaters of an hour in a dark station with vomit all over the 
place we decide to buy something to read. I buy "Sprts Argus" and
Dylan buys "SMUT". (What good taste he has)
I check the Argus for the Owls result.
Sheffield Wednesday 2    Watford 0
"YYYyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!"
I jump about the station and everyone gives me funny looks.
Eventually our train gets in. We pile aboard. 
Sitting across the row from us is this weird man who keeps smiling at
Chris. The speakers burst into life.
"Thiz iz yoor captin spekin. Crshugy train delhgfyy hjhkkk  brrrr
on jfffty two. Thank you."
Everyone looks bewildered.
"I think he said People going to Wolverhampton should go on the
other train." Said the strange man in a duffel coat smiling in
a sinister fashion at Chris.
We began a very long wait. A guard came and apologized to us
saying "I'm Sorry but we can't find a driver at the moment."
Hopeless! You sit for an hour in a railway station because they 
can't find a driver! He was probably having a pint round the 
corner or a good wank in the toilet. We were getting well pissed off. 
Duffel coat man gave Chris another smile, tucked his suitcase under
his seat, got up and stepped out of the train and started walking
away. We stared at this strange person. He turned and ran like
shit down the station, turning a corner then pegging it up a
flight of stairs.
"Where the hell's he gone?" I ask, though releived to be rid of him.
"And why the hell was he running?"
We all turn and look at his abondonded breifcase.
The same thought crosses our minds
"Holy shit theres a bomb in it!" Says Dylan.
All over London we'd seen poster telling us to report any sightings
of suspicous packages to the Police as they may be bombs.
"That man did look weird, but did he look Irish?" Asked Chris.
"He could be from any terrorist group or maybe just a mad
anarchist or a depressed Amiga owner wanting revenge on
society for giving him such a shit computer."
I was joking now, but I really was scared. A strange man leaving
a briefcase on packed train in Birmingham then running like shit
left us with only one conclusion.
"If we start moving before he comes back, I'm going to throw
that case out the window." Says Dylan.
"Yes, my TCB Tracker may get damaged."
"Fuck your TCB Tracker, I don't want to be the IRAs latest victim!"
As the time passed we started to sweat more and more.
Then it happened. The man returned.
"I've just been talking to the guard." He said.
We looked at each other and burst out laughing.

We arrived home about an hour late, exhausted but happy.
It had been a great day, and I'll go again next year, and I'll
order a ticket in advance next time!
