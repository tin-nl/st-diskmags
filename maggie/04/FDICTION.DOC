
Alright, here it is, for all you guys out there eager to come 'nd 
drink a beer with me in Geneva: 


THE DEFINITIVE (or MINDBOMBING) DICTIONARY IN FRENCH
by Maulwurf


Arrival - Arriv‚:

Vous avez quelque-chose a d‚clarer?|Do you have anything to 
                                   |declare?
THE CORRECT RESPONSE SHOULD BE:
Non, j'ai rien a d‚clarer!         |No, I have nothing to declare
                                   |(Delivered with conviction)

IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU FEEL AUDACIOUS AND WANT TO STARE UP THE 
BARREL OF A KALASHNIKOV ASSAULT-RIFLE FEEL FREE TO SAY THE 
FOLLOWING:
Bien s–r, trou de cul, j'ai des    |Certainly, asshole, I've got 
drogues et je suis cupide.         |drugs and I'm avaricious.

THE ANSWER TO THAT WILL MOST PROBABLY BE A SHORT SHRUG WITH THE 
SHOULDERS OF THE CUSTOMS OFFICER, A WAVE WITH HIS RIFLE TO GO ON. 
AFTER THE FIRST FEW STEPS HE WILL SHOOT YOUR LEFT EAR OFF 
STATING:
Des drogues, €a va, vous pouvez les|Drugs are alright, you can 
obtenir partout dans le jardin     |get them anywhere in the 
anglais … GenŠve.                  |English Garden in Geneva. 
Tout le monde est cupide … GenŠve. |Everyone is greedy in Geneva. 
                                        !!!!BLAST!!!!                                                                          
Mais l'outrage d'un fonctionaire ..|But the affront of a CIVIL 
c'est une tout autre chose!!!      |SERVANT ... that's another 
                                   |thing entirely!!!

BY THE WAY, HE  DELIBERATELY SHOT  OF YOUR  LEFT EAR,  BECAUSE HE 
HATES THOSE COMMIE SWINES,  BUT HE WOULDN'T TELL YOU THAT,  WOULD 
HE NOW.

IF  YOU  BEHAVED LIKE A GOOD SWISS CITIZEN AND  CHOSE  THE  FIRST 
ANSWER  YOU MAY CONTINUE LIKE A GOOD SWISS CITIZEN AND  GO  ABOUT 
YOUR  BUSINESS.  IF YOU DIDN'T BEHAVE LIKE A GOOD SWISS  CITIZEN, 
BUT  RATHER  LIKE  A (no,  not a bad  swiss  citizen)  SHIT-FACED 
BASTARD  OF  A  BAD  FOREIGN CITIZEN,  YOU WILL  HAVE  TO  GO  TO 
HOSPITAL.

Hospital - Hospital:

ONCE ARRIVED THERE YOU WILL BE ASKED:
Ah, bien s–r, vous ˆtes le personne| 
avec l'appendice. Venez ici.       |
SINCE  YOU DON'T NOW,  WHAT THE HECK SHE'S TALKING ABOUT (as  I'm 
not telling you, so there), YOU FIGURE IT TO BE SAFEST TO UTILIZE 
ONE THIRD OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH. BOLDLY YOU STATE:
Oui!                                |Yes!
AND  OFF  YOU ARE WHISKED TO THE NEXT OPERATING THEATRE  TO  HAVE 
YOUR  APPENDICITIS  REMOVED,   BECAUSE  WHAT  SHE  SAID  WAS  THE 
FOLLOWING:
                                   |Ah,   surely,   you  are  the 
                                   |person with the addendicitis.
                                   |Come here.
NOW YOU SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KNOW RUDIMENTARY  FRENCH.  AND 
ALWAYS CARRY THIS DICTIONARY WITH YOU, SO BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY ETC.

AFTER HAVING PATCHED YOU UP,  THE DOCTOR DECIDES TO KEEP YOU  FOR 
OBSERVATION FOR ONE MORE DAY.
THE NURSE ENTERS THE ROOM. GOD, IS SHE GORGEOUS(ly horny).
Est-ce que vous avez besoin de     |Do you need ANYTHING?
QUELQUE-CHOSE?                     |
SADLY, YOU REALIZE ONLY AFTER SHE HAS LEFT, WHAT SHE REALLY MEANT 
BY  THAT.  NOW  YOU  KNOW WHAT KIND OF  DIFFERENCE  THAT  SPECIAL 
PRONUNCIATION CAN MAKE, YOU WOLLY!

Public House - Taverne/Bistrot 

AFTER ALL THIS HASSLE , YOU DECIDE, THAT YOU HAVE EARNED YOURSELF 
A DRINK. THE NEAREST PUB, WHICH SEEMS TO BE OF INTEREST TO YOU IS 
THE  "POST CAFE".  IT IS FRIDAY EVENING.  YOU ENTER THE  PUB  AND 
IMMEDIATELY  YOU  FEEL AT HOME,  AS WHIFFS  OF  EVERY  IMAGINABLE 
TOBACCO  DRIFT  IN YOUR DIRECTION AND SOMEONE IS  PUKING  IN  THE 
CORNER.  
Que  voulez-vous avoir,  mec?  Une |What do  you  want, sunny?
sonny? Une canet de biŠre ou quoi  |A pint of beer or what else?
d'autre?

EASY  AS  PIE,  BUT THEN YOU HAVEN'T YET  FOUND  THE  APPROPRIATE 
PHRASE  TO ANSWER TO THAT. YOU STUTTER SOMETHING FROM YOUR  LONG-
GONE SCHOOL DAYS, HOPING IT TO BE THE CORRECT RESPONSE.
Non, monsieur, nous n'avons pas du |No, sir, we haven't got shit 
merde sur toast, garnir avec des   |on toast, garnished with 
cornichons!!!                      |cucumbers!!!



Time  to go for now,  as it is already the24th of August and  the 
Ed.  is  waiting  for  the articles from  Geneva.  I  promise  to 
continue  the  "DEFINITIVE DICTIONARY"½¾¿ in the  next  issue  of 
"Disk Maggie".
     
            See   you   at  the  "Clash   of   the   Titans"   in 
Berne/Switzerland on the 23rd September.
