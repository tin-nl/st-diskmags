
                   THE ULTIMATE RIPPING CARTRIDGE
                                  Previewed by Michael Schuessler


     This here is only a quick advert and prieview for a new kind 
of  cartridge on the market.  A full review will be in  Maggie  5 
after I had some time to use the cartridge.  

     This cartridge has been developed by a French company called 
EURO-SOFT.  You have probably never heard of this company  before 
but  let  me  tell you that these guys sure know  what  they  are 
doing! 

     The cartridge garantees that it can interrupt any program by 
using just a simply switch on the cartridge.  A program will then 
be  activated  with which you can  rip  graffix,  musix,  examine 
source  code  and do many other things.  To explain some  of  the 
functions  in greater detail I should tell you that you  can  you 
can  for example hack musix in less than 5 minutes.  The  program 
will  do  all  the work for you,  you simply have  to  enter  the 
offset.   You are then asked whether you want to save the file as 
a binary or a program file to disk.

     The  graphics function allows you to take out  any  graphics 
out of any program,  you simply have to scroll through the memory 
in order to find where the graffix are.  You then have to put the 
4  bit planes on top of each other and you have got  the  correct 
picture in front of you.

     The  ripper contains many more functions and  is  definitely 
one  of a kind.  It is very easy to use,  you don't need to  know 
much  about  the computer in order to use the cartridge  and  the 
program.  In  case  you  want to hack some musix out  of  a  demo 
without  having  to  bother about the protection  first  GET  THE 
ULTIMATE CARTRIDGE.

     The program runs on any Atari ST, STF, STE or even Mega.
