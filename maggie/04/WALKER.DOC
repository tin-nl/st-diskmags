                               Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     I  hate  1st Word plus,  I simply hate  it.  You  would  not 
believe  how often it happened to me that it simply  froze  while 
editing  a  program.  As you have probably gathered  I  had  this 
article finished already when this stupid program crashed on  me. 
I had written about two A4 pages this incident took place and  as 
I had not saved it before,  all of it was lost.  I do not  really 
feel  like typing all again,  which means that this article  when 
end up to be quite short.

     Both  the Walker animations come on a double sided disk  and 
need  at  least one megabyte or more to run.  The idea  for  this 
animation  originated on the amiga and has now been converted  to 
the ST by Radical Systems.  In order to run them one has to  load 
the  AVS sample palyer first and then use the  option  load,  but 
beware,  it  will take quite some time until you will be able  to 
see it. 

                         
                    WALKER DEMO I
                    -------------

     The first sequence is of the Walker walking towards you on a 
table with the light shining from the right so that you will  see 
a  shadow on the left on the Amiga 2000 (I personally think  that 
the Amiga should have been censored,  you cannot have an Amiga in 
a positive way on the Atari ST !?!).  The animation is very  well 
done,  even the slightest bit is well animated as for example the 
head. The head moves in many frames and therefore one gets a very 
smooth  animations.  The camera view the changes and one  sees  a 
close  up of the head spinning to the right so that you  can  see 
most  of the robots 'face'.  Before the heads starts  moving  you 
will  be able to observe another shot seeing the walker from  the 
side with the amiga in the backgound.  By the way, throughout the 
whole  time there is a sample playing (I think it is supposed  to 
be the noise, the scratching of the metal on the floor). The head 
then  slowly turns to the left and starts firing out of  two  big 
machine guns from either side of the face.  Along with the  shots 
there is a nice shooting sound.

A quick summary for Walker I is now due:

                    WALKER DEMO II

     This  animation is better than the first one,  but  this  is 
probably  due to the fact that it is longer.  This sequence  does 
not take part on a table as the last one did but in  Chicago,  to 
be  more  exact in one of the  suburbs  called  Illignois.  While 
watching this,  various information pops up on the screen  giving 
you various information like that or for example that  Imaginatic 
Presents  a Brian Williams Production.  The first real  animation 
starts  with a spotlight moving across some skyscrapers  followed 
by the sound of rotors and a chopper flying into the screen.  The 
picture  then changes so that one is able to see the Walker  from 
the back with the helicopter circling above it. 

     The scene changes again, it zooms in on the helicopter which 
can  then  be  seen blasting the hell out of  its  machine  guns. 
Another  change  in  the view takes place and  you  can  see  the 
bullets exploding on the Walker's body leaving some sort of  burn 
marks.  The scene changes again,  the heli shoots,  but this time 
aiming for the head. The final and last change in the camera view 
shows the explosion on the Walker's head and its response to  the 
choppers aggressive behaviour which results in a few short blasts 
out of its cannons. Throughout the fight are some nice samples of 
the explosions and the shooting.
