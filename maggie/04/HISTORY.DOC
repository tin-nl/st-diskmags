     Although many of you may only have heard of us within the past few 
months we have been around just a little longer !!!

Once upon a time there was a little boy called Christopher.  This little 
boy was rather technically minded and enjoyed electrical bits and pieces.  
This was probably due to his fathers' obsession with electronics.  Late, 
one Christmas night there was a pattering of tiny hooves on the roof of 
Christopher's house.  A big fat old man in a red suit slid silently down 
the chimney.  This was regared as quite an achievement since the chimney 
was in fact just 50cm in diameter.  The old man carefully clambered out 
from behind the gas fire and staggered across the room to the christmas 
tree.  Sitting down, he started to open a large sack which he had also 
managed to pull down the chimney with him.  From within the large sack the 
man pulled out an array of small parcels.  Each of these parcels was 
wrapped in a cheap coloured paper.  The presents were placed carefully 
around the foot of the plastic Christmas tree.  In the light of the 
half-moon and the coloured lights on the tree, the old man spotted a small 
glass of a rather strong intoxicating substance which smelled supiciously 
like sherry.  Next to the glass was a mince pie.  The old man, reached out 
across the sofa to the table where the food lay.

Twenty minutes later there was nothing more than a few crumbs and an empty 
glass.  The old man stood up and with great skill managed to climb back up 
the chimney.  There was a little shuffling on the roof and the old man and 
his reindeer were gone.

Next morning Christopher woke up and blinked.  Already the excitment grew. 
His little heart was racing as he pulled on his clothes.  The snow was 
falling outside (Cancel another bloody show !!!), as he skippped happily 
down the stairs to see if Santa had visited...  

As he pushed open the door he noticed, with excitment, that Santa had 
been: There were a collection of little presents under the little plastic 
tree.  He could contain his excitement no longer.  With happy squeals of 
fun he unwrapped his presents.

Christopher sat down amongst the sea of torn paper and wondered which one 
of his many presents to play with first.  Then a little present wrapped in 
reflective green paper caught his eye.  He hadn't noticed this present on 
an earlier inspection of the room.

Having opened the box Christopher discovered a small black and grey 
"thing" which had the name ZX81 stamped upon the outside.  It also had 
strange rows of letters and funny words written by most of the letters.

Four hours later when his parents got up they found a little boy gazing 
intently at their television set, to which their young boy had attached 
his strange black "thing".  After initial objections from his parents 
Christopher carefully explained that the "thing" was a home micro-computer 
which was capable of performing many great tasks.  The micro-computer 
would revolutionize all of their lives and give him endless hours of fun.  
He then asked to be left alone while he read the manual...

By the time the Christmas roast was sitting, steaming on the table, 
Christopher had produced an exciting new game called SPACE INVADERS.  He 
had written a stunning convertion of the classic arcade game that he had 
seen on holiday.  Of course every machine has its limitations, Christopher 
had had to improvise a little.  The mother ship was a letter "A" and the 
invaders were "H".  The invaders fired stars and the hero "A" fired full 
stops.  Unfortunatly the mega game kept stopping and displaying 4/300.  A 
quick scan through the manual revealed that he was out of memory !!!

Christmas had come and gone.  The cold north wind rampaged around outside 
knocking down peoples fences.  The winter dragged on, Christopher sat in 
his cosy warm bedroom with his beloved computer which he named Clive.  
More and more games were coded.  These games were soon optimised for speed 
when his father brought home a RAM pack which took Clive up to a massive 
16K.

Just over one year later Christopher's skill had increased dramatically 
and a brand new computer had been released.  This computer was called a 
SPECTRUM.  The computer boasted COLOUR and SOUND.  As Christmas '83 
approached little Christopher was now a big 10 year old.  The letter to 
Santa inevitably carried a request for the latest state of the art 
technology.  

Unfortunatly Santa brought a SPECTRUM instead...

On Christmas day Christopher sat and played with his new computer.  He 
managed to create many new games and utilities with his powerful new 
computer.  In the early spring of 1984 a RAM pack was added to his 
faithful Spectrum.

Although Christopher did not know it yet another little boy was around.  
The other little boy called James, lived just twelve miles away and had 
similar computer related interests to our little hero, Christopher.

That September the two boys were now quite big boys, at SENIOR school !!!

The two boys met and became the best of friends...

Christopher and James often spoke to each other about computers and 
programming.  They also lent each other games and exchanged programming 
ideas.

Nothing really happened for the next four years, except that their school 
which was an all boys school merged with an all girls school...

OK BULLSHIT OVER (I HOPE YOU LIKED THE STORY) !!!

In the early fourth year I got an Atari 520 STFM.  I became interested in 
programming and started a crew called "NO RULES" I coded a demo in STOS 
BASIC.  The demo was quite good, but never spread very far.  I became 
frustated with the restrictions of the high level language and so I 
started learning a low level language (Hence : The Lower Level !!!).  I 
began to learn from ST Format about the basics of programming.  I bought 
ST INTERNALS and learnt to program.  In those early days it was hard to 
get to grips with the language.  I was helped a great deal by the articals 
in ST NEWS.  Although surprisingly I learnt more from the TEX articals 
than I did from the learn assembler series.  TEX wrote some amazing 
tutorials such as how to remove the lower border and how to use advanced 
raster interrupts.  Although rasters are perhaps not the easiest way to 
learn assember the results are worth working for.

NO RULES split up soon after I started learning assembler.  A lamer called 
Andrew Bowd decided that he "wouldn't be my friend anymore".  Since he was 
such a lamer and a failed artist I was glad to see the back of him.  
Especially after he virus killed all his commercial games !!!  After I 
threw him out of NO RULES he came to visit me at the shop where I work and 
tried to call me a lamer !!!  I still can't understand how this little 
shit who couldn't understand BBC BASIC had the cheek to call me a lamer !!

Here is an example of a program he wrote for the BBC :

10 REM *** MEGA CIRCLES BY ANDY BOWD ***
20 INPUT "PLEASE SELECT THE MODE YOU'D LIKE"m
30 MODE m
40 MODE 1
50 ....

This is a genuine program he wrote.  From 50 onwards was a demonstration 
program from the BBC manual.  The program only worked in mode 1 anyway !!!

Anyway James and I got together and decided to form a new crew.  After a 
walk around our local park we finally thought of a name : THE LOWER LEVEL.

The crew started with me and James.  We then got Peter who was in NO RULES
to join.  Finally we got Wayland (That's his real name !!!) to join.
Our most recent member is JOE 90 who is pretty inactive at present.  

So the crew was formed :

THE LOWER LEVEL :

-ZCT-  : Programmer, ripper, and P.R. man.

J.I.M. : Programmer, and optimizer.  (Loves to try to optimize my code !!!)

NONDESCRIPT : Artist (A very good one too !!!)

E.R.O.S. : An excellent musician.  He does digi musixx.  Belive it or not 
           but this guy actually wrote a routine to remove all the borders
           on a BBC !!!  In fact he also coded rasters on a BBC too !!!
           THIS IS TRUE !!!

JOE 90 : A good friend of ours who may (eventually) produce some digi 
         music for us.

As a crew we are getting quite a few contacts now and our crew is really 
getting quite good.  Unfortunatly we have very little spare time to code 
but we are gradually putting screens together for UNDER-C.

We would still like more contacts, so if you code, rip, crack, draw or do 
anything useful then contact us (NO LAMERS PLEASE) : 

THE LOWER LEVEL (ZCT),
34 OVERBOOK DRIVE,
CHELTENHAM,
GLOUCESTERSHIRE,
GL52 3HR.
ENGLAND.


-ZCT- over and out !!!

That's it...
