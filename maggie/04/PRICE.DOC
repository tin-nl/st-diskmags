If you buy more then 10 disks, you get 10p of each disk, if you

disks,  you get 40 pence of each disk (I am good at maths!!).
If you buy 50 disks you still only get 40 pence of each disk. 

I have no idea which programs run on the STE and which do not, 
but if you puchase a program of us and it does not run on your STE,
you can have your money back or choose a different disk. Anyway,
I reckon that most of the stuff I have got should run on the STE.

If you would like an updated Pd list, send a blank disk to:
