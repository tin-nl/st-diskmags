Hello freaks all over the world,

I finally decided to write an article for Maggie. I don't want to continue
this gossip about copy parties, party animals, crazy drivers, wrecking
Marseille, swimming at night, sleeping at daytime, chatting up girls, demo
competitions, drinking.
Right now, you might be wondering "What else could Axe be talking about then?"
Well I could start talking about my stay at London for the PC show.
That would mean talking about crying babies, locked front doors, driving on
the left, visiting pubs, drinking piss water, milkshakes, police stations,
burning pencils, Kebabs.
But no. I admit it would be interesting, but I am here to write some serious
business stuff.
After a long break I went back to coding packing routines. Pack-Ice 2.12 was
old and didn't pack as effective as the new packers that are out there.
So I took another step on my journey to the best packer on ST.
Some people told me about bugs that were in the older versions. I removed all
of those little beasts.
What else did I do? Well I shortened the unpacking source and made it run 
faster at the same time. Besides, all packed files are now smaller than before
no matter if they are data or executable files.
There is still the old shell around the packer. I will use a completely new
one for version 3.0. But as it seems, it will take some time until that version
is finished. The reason is that there are so many features that all need to be
programmed.
Some of them are: ultra fast packing time, (maybe) even smaller packed files,
pack and unpack data and executable files easily and more. I wanted to put a
batch-pack option into the packer, but I would never use it and I don't think
other people would. The use of wildcards ? and * is all I ever need.
Wait and you will see its new great options.

Ok, enough crap talk in here, and boring as well, so I will stop.
Remember that Pack-Ice 2.20 is only a little reminder that I am still coding
and later versions will follow. So please don't complain about the bad shell.
I know that it is not very comfortable.

Ok, guys, here are some personal greetings.
Hi to: Snake, Wanderer, Jinx, Simon, Little Lulu, Rob, Derek, Beccy, Andy,
Phil, Bald Eagle, his wife, Sledgehammer, Chris, Uncle Kalle, Annette.


Yours Axe
