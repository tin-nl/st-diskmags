HOW TO MAKE A SOUND CHANNEL VOLUME INDICATOR BY POWER MAN OF THE WILD BOYS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chill out guys(why does he always say that?), it's your homeboy Power Man
chillin' out and ready to tell you how to make a volume indicator. If you
don't know what this is, then you must be a lamer, so sod off! If you are
not a lamer and don't know what it is, then it is a graphic on the screen
which changes according to the volume of one of the sound channels. You
may have seen this is the Delta Force screen on the Union demo, where balls
enlarge and shrink according to the volume of the 3 channels. The example
I have done puts three colours bars on the screen and flashes them in time
to the music(you can use this music in your own demos, just copy the
routines SETMUS and ENDMUS, the music is in a file called MUSIC.DAT).
The source code is a file called VOLUME.S, and VOLUME.PRG is the executable
file.

I'll briefly explain how it works:

The volume for each of the 3 channels are contained in 3 registers,
which are numbered 8,9 and 10. To access them, you put the register
number into location $FFFF8800 like this:

MOVE.B #8,$FFFF8800.W

Location $FFFF8800 now contains the volume of channel A, which is a number
between 0 and 15. You can get this value in register D0 like this:

MOVE.B $FFFF8800.W,D0

However, if the volume is being controlled by an envelope, you will get
a value of 0, so you need to set the value if an envelope is being used,
like this:

	BTST #4,D0	;is it an envelope?
	BEQ .L1		;if not, piss off
	MOVE.B #10,D0   ;manually set the volume
.L1	rest of code

NOTE: The volume can be set to anything, but 10 is a cool number, dude.

You can repeat this for channels B and C. Once you have the volume,
all you have to do is use this value to locate the corresponding animation
frame or colour data, the possibilities are endless....
My example uses the volume values to locate the corresponding colour, and
then just sets colours 1,2 and 4 to these colours. Simple but very effective.

Well, thats it for now. Look out for my WILD DEMO, coming soon. I need some
grafix and muzix though(I can't do everything!), so please send me some
stuff (I'm talking about grafix and muzix!) to:
