                     ...By Harvey Lodder...

Ladies and gentlemen, it's Christmas time again and what a really 
shitty time is going to be had by all...

In this third issue of The Lost Boys disk magazine, Harvey Lodder 
takes a true view of Christmas, any why? Well, this magazine is 
going to released around Christmas time and I think Christmas is 
the biggest rip off in the universe.

So let's take a peek at a few subjects at a time...

TELEVISION

Why do we keep buying those 2 week Radio and TV Times? After all 
we all know what's going to be on at christmas time, don't we. 
We'll have It'll Be Alright On The Night 5, 20 Years Of The Two 
Ronnies, Sorry, Play Your Cards Right Xmas Special, Blind Date 
Xmas Special and the list goes on... 

The only thing that we can't be quite sure of is the films. But 
all you have to do is make a guess at something like Star Wars, 
Superman (yawn), Ghostbusters or Back To The Future.

So what you do, is you dig out last years TV papers and follow 
the TV guide, but remember that the programmes will be the same 
and the films will be different. Just remember, in place of last 
years James Bond film will be the next one on in the sequence.


THE FAMILY

Now here's a good one! Why does the family have to get together 
on Christmas Day AND Boxing Day, what is so special about these 
two days and WHY do you get hated by all your family after not 
going to any one of these special events. After all, there is 
another 363 days left in the year that you could decide to visit 
the family, so why the hell does it have to be Christmas.

You can just picture the scene, you got the whole family sitting 
around the table, each pretending to be enjoying themselves. 
You've got the ONE missing person that everybody hates, just 
because they've got more sense (and guts), and they stayed at 
home and everyone else is THERE.

Then comes the afternoon and out comes the Trivial Pursuit set, 
It's been three years and you know all the fucking answers, but 
still why can't they get a new box of cards, no, they like to 
give everybody a chance to argue about the same questions that 
they argued about last year, just to keep the FAMILY CHRISTMAS 
SPIRIT going. Ha, bloody ha!

THE PRESENTS

This is another good one! Why do you always get the slippers, the 
soap, a tie and some aftershave. Is your family trying to tell 
you something that they don't have the guts to say (or smell) at 
the dinner table? Then they really get pissed off if they don't 
see you wearing your slippers, tie, aftershave and soap stains 
each and every time they see you for the next twelve months.

The truth of the matter is that the best present that anybody 
could buy would be a Till Reciept book. This book would have 
loads of till Reciepts that you could use to take back all those 
presents that you always seem to get brought that you don't have 
a use for. Prime examples of these are ties, slippers, wine 
racks, hat stands, glasses, Kylie records, Kylie posters and 
videos of The Best Of The Price Is Right.

THE PARTIES

It is a well know fact that you have two parties around the 
Christmas period. The Christmas Eve party were you get pissed and 
hope not to remember the next week of your life and another 
party.

This other party is often disguised as a New Year party. Well, 
this is really a party to celebrate the next twelve months of 
debt that you face after buying all those Christmas presents that 
all your family spend the next tweleve months trying to take 
back. The only way that they can really give them away is by 
giving them to somebody else who they hate in the family. It has 
often been said, that in five years time you'll get a present 
from your Uncle that you brought you Brother five years ago.

Still, until next time...
