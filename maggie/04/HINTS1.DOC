SPEEDBALL
Here are some juicy tips.
Before the ball is launched, move your joystick in the
direction of the counter and hold down fire. When the ball is
launched your player will slide into the launcher and grab it.
Continue running diagonally until you hit a wall. Turn and tap
the fire button to shoot an on target shot.
When in your oppenets half, always keep the ball low by tapping
fire - never hold it down.
To score from your own half, launch a long shot down the pitch
and get one of your strikers to punch out the keeper. The ball will
fly into an unprotected goal.
If your playing against a 'chum', and you've just the keeper to
beat, dance about in fron of the keeper. Eventually your 'chum'
will move the wrong way or dive and you've got an easy shot.
Diagonal shots are a lot harder to save.
Keep moving and pass as often as possible. If you are in possession
in your own half its best to throw a lob down the pitch than risk
being tackled and conceding a goal.
