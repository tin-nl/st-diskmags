Well I don't know Gladys, these title screens are getting stranger 
by the day, we used to do all ours by hand you know... CIH in "Mrs 
Brady - Old lady" mode..

You may well know who Jeff Minter is already,  famous for his work 
on  the VIC 20 and CBM 64,  and his well weird appearance  (Longer 
hair  than Sammy Joe - A considerable achievement..)  His  'animal 
loving  tendencies' Stop sniggering,  it's all perfectly  innocent 
and  above board,  and lately his views on the state of ST gaming, 
particularly  on licence games,  and recent attempts to break back 
into  the software scene,  with such characteristically  different 
releases  as  ANDES ATTACK,  GRIDRUNNER,  and one I forget for the 
moment,  not  forgetting  TRIP-A-TRON  of  course....  These  have 
received,   well,   mixed  reviews  from  the  computer  press  (I 
personally  liked  GRIDRUNNER...)  and have  been  criticised  for 
lacking something in graphic presentation particularly...

Jeff considers that most games are hyped-up with state of the  art 
graphix,  but  the gameplay content has DECLINED over the years... 
Most  games  just seem to present rows of  multi-coloured  sprites 
lining up in their pre-arranged positions to be blasted away... He 
particularly  considers DEFENDER to be one of the all-time  greats 
of  the  arcade,  and  is  keen to replicate  this  on  the  16bit 
machines..  DEFENDER II, which is officially licenced by Atari, is 
his latest venture, how is it looking...

What I got was a single level preview version,  which nevertheless 
gives  a good impression of what to expect (And is bloody hard  to 
play still...) The final product will in fact offer three games in 
the  package,  the  original DEFENDER,  STARGATE,  which is 'Son of 
Defender'  and  DEF II of course..  The single level of DEF II  is 
like  an  enhanced  original  Defender  screen,  with  shaded  and 
slightly  more elaborate sprites,  but the same  vector-mountains, 
and simple black background...

All  sounds are sampled,  with suitably heavy noises,  explosions, 
etc to complement the action..  The game is as fast and furious as 
it's  arcade  grandparent,  J.M.  being very keen to replicate the 
exact  qualities of the original..  The control system throws  the 
joystick out of the window,  using the mouse for up/down movement, 
righthand  button for turning the craft back and forth,  and  left 
button for thrust.. 'Shift' is the key used for firing your laser, 
and  there  are  various other keys  for  smart-bombs,  hyperspace 
etc...

Amongst other things,  there is a Fractal 'Smartlaser' for nailing 
a target as you go by..  The final game,  in addition to the usual 
levels, will have a number of special missions to complete. All in 
all, this is very much like Defender as I know (knew!) it, totally 
unforgiving, as you get hit, you lose a life, very simple eh...

People not used to the control system will be put-off at first, as 
this is very much a game of skill,  it is not recommended for lazy 
gamers,  but if you like a challenge, or are a DEFENDER freak with 
long hair, then this is worth a look or three....

I  have not done any ratings for this,  as this is a preview only, 
and  it  is unfair to judge something when it  is  only  partially 
completed - ok?
