Scene 1.
   A small sitting room. A piano sits in the corner looking around morosly.
Three fellows come in.

Tim:     Well, that was a jolly nice thing.
Gary:    Yes, it was.
Brian:   But not quite as good as that other thing.
Tim:     Yes, I think you might be right.
    They sit down on a large sofa.
Brian:   Well, what now?
Gary:    Here, I know, let's have some crunchy healthy carrot sticks.
Tim:     But I forgot the Rap Tou!
Others:  Oh, you are forgetful Tim!
    Tim looks round the room, hiding his blushes.
Brian:   (whispering to Gary) We could always sacrafice Tim to Satan.
Gary:    (whispering) Yes, we could.
Brian:   Tim! Come here a minute. I want to ask you something.
Tim:     Well, ask away Brian.
Brian:   Well, how would you feel about being sacraficed to the lord Satan?
Tim:     Well, I'm game.
Gary:    Good, that's that settled then.
    Gary and Brian hurry out of the room chatting merrily.
    A few seconds later they come back wearing thier cerominial robes and
    carrying long pointy knives.
Gary:    Well, if you'd just like to lie down on the piano we'll begin.
Tim:     Ok.
    He lies down on the piano.
Piano:   Hoy, get off me back you little shit.
Brian:   Oh shut up you horrible working class person.
Piano:   Ok Mr Marx.

    Brain and Gary begin chanting.
Brian:   Ok Tim, pull your trousers down.
Tim:     Look here you chaps. I'm perfectly willing to die for the dark
         Lord of evil, but I'm not taking my trousers off.
Gary:    Oh well then.
    Brian and gary disrobe and put the knives away in a safe place.

Scene 2
    It's three weeks later and the chaps are at a party.
    Through the genral group Tim pushes his way towards a pretty young
    girl with blonde hair.

Tim:     Your hair's nice, isn't it?
Pam:     Yes, it is rather. Do mind if I grind this meatclever into your
         face?
Tim:     Well, yes, I do mind really.
Pam:     Oh well.
    They sit down on a passing sofa.
Tim:     I like wrapping things up in brown paper you know.
Pam:     Really? So do I!
Tim:     Well, we've got so much in common, why don't we get married?
Pam:     That's because it's too early in the afternoon for lunch.
Tim:     Oh well, maybe another time.
Pam:     Yes, maybe another time.
Tim:     Here, let me.
Pam:     Ok.
    Tim stands up rather violently, smashing his glass then throwing
    the shards out of the window killing a young mother in the process.
Pam:     Oh dear, you are a clumsy fellow. What's your name?
Tim:     Tim.
Pam:     Mine is Pam.
Tim:     Do mind if I call you Pam then? Pam is awfully stuffy.
Pam:     Yes, it is, isn't it.
    They burst into enourmous fits of laughter, only halted when Pam dies
    of heart failure rather overdramaticaly in the middle of the floor.
    Brian wanders up to Tim.
Brian:   Seen Gary? I left by the bookshop about three days ago and I've
         not seen him since.
Tim:     No. I've not seen him.
Brian:   Oh well.
    Brian wanders off into the throng.
    Tim meets a rather nice spiderplant called Karen.
Karen:   Hey, let's us get married and have eighty billion children Tim.
Tim:     Hey, I'm not just a sex machine you know doll. I do have a nose.
Karen:   Hey, let's us get married and have eighty million children Tim.
Tim:     But if we have that many I'll be all tired out from the
         documentaries.
Karen:   Hey, let's us get married and have eighty million children Tim.
Tim:     Well, let's me sleep on it for a lifetime or so. EEEEEEEEEEEE.
Karen:   Hey...
    Tim runs off screaming "EEEEEEEE".
Brian:   Is that you Gary?
Gary:    No it's Brian here.
Brian:   Are you sure?
Gary:    Well no, not really.
Brian:   Ok, what does your mother call you?
Gary:    Gary.
Brain:   Ok, I'll just call you Gary as well then. Ok?
Gary:    Well, I suppose so.
Brian:   Good party isn't it?
Gary:    Yes, I've not had so much fun in ages. Doesn't Tim look nice up
         there?
Brian:   Yes, he does, Doesn't he.
    They both look at Tim.
