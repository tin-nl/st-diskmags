                         Spoken about by Michael Schuessler

     This is something for all the Jochen Hippel fans out  there, 
whether you like his sound chip tunes,  his 4 tracks or his  chip 
musix  with  the  sampled  drum  lines,  this  CD  is  definitely 
something for you. The CD is produced under the Thalion Label and 
you should be able to obtain it from any good record shop or from 
Thalion directly. 

     The  CD  costs about 8 to 10 pounds and is  well  worth  it. 
There are 7 tunes on the disc featuring some extended version  of 
the  sampled  musix he wrote for games likes Wings of  Death  and 
others. 

     The tunes which are featured on there carry the names:

                    1. Wings of Death (Main Theme) (4:59)
                    2. Bittner Rap (5:06)
                    3. Glory (No Second Prize) (4:43)
                    4. Wings of Death (Second Theme) (5:03)
                    5. The Tower (Off Power) (4:24)
                    6. The Wizard (4:00)
                    7. Experts from Dragonflight (Part I-III)
                       Part I Dawn At Ontaflareth
                       Part II Night at Pagene
                       Part III Olagstag's Flight (8:39)

     These  here are all the songs on the Compact Disc which  you 
will want to listen to.  The Bitmap Rap is not the same as on the 
Life's a Bitch demo,  it is completely different, but still quite 
nice.  The  type  of musix is quite hard  to  define,  you  would 
probably say that it is the kind of musix featured in the  charts 
at the moment,  a bit of hip-hop,  a bit of acid,  it is a bit of 
everything really.      

     In the inside of the CD you can find further information  on 
each one of the titles,  telling you how it was developed and who 
inspired Jochen Hippel and so on and so on....

     Overall I really like the CD.


                                             Michael Schuessler

P.S.:  I really think that the CD is a must for any Jochen Hippel 
       fan.
