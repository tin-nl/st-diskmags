
             THE EUROPEAN DEMOS BY THE OVERLANDERS & FRIENDS
                         Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     This  here is probably the biggest ever demo in the  history 
of  ST  kind.   Never  ever  have  so  many  different  ST  crews 
participated in one product.  This product is so big so that they 
had to make it two discs.  I was told that it runs on a half  meg 
and more. 

     As  in  so  many  other demos the  crews  begin  to  feature 
fullscreens  (this demo contains some of the best  fullscreens  I 
have ever seen!). The loader of the demo is its first fullscreen. 
The  entire fullscreen background is moving up with some  sprites 
at  the  top saying European Demos moving from the  left  to  the 
right.  In  addition  to that there is some info  on  the  screen 
wobbling about.

     The  Overlanders  sure seem to like  Coke,  the  next  intro 
screen consists of some text saying "You can't beat the  feeling" 
with  some spotlights moving over that.  You can then  hear  some 
people  applauding  just before the screen changes to  some  very 
very nicely hand drawn pictures. 

     The  actual  loader screen which always appears  before  the 
disc  drive  is  being  accessed consists  of  some  nice  vector 
graphics.  First  of  all  the 3D says Loading  and  when  it  is 
finished loading it changes to Loaded.  There are some arrows  at 
the bottom of the screen which show how much has been loaded yet. 
There  is also some text scrolling up which informs you  on  what 
you  are about to see and by whom it is...  Along with  all  that 
there is a very nicely looped sample.  If the demo is on disk two 
you  are asked to insert the second disk via a very nice 3D  disk 
spinning about.  WHile the code is decrunching we can see a clock 
ticking  away  showing  you how much time you  will  have  to  be 
waiting until everything is finally depacked.

     The main menu also consists of another fullscreen.  But  the 
menu  idea is pretty boring,  as in all the other demos you  must 
guide this man to the various doors where the screens are.  Along 
with all that there is some more music.

     PENDRAGONS I:
     There  is  nothing  much special in  this  screen.  A  twist 
scroller at the bottom of the screen,  a turning tube at the  top 
and a starfield coming towards you.  The special feature in  this 
screen is the bouncing ball that consists out of dots.  This ball 
is bouncing into the distance and is coming towards you again. 

     HMD I:
     There  is  a wobbler at the back,  some one  plane  text  is 
scrolling through the entire background.  On top of that there is 
a more plane scroller going through all possible borders. This is 
probably  the  biggest font that I have ever seen  in  my  entire 
life.  Along  with  all that there is a two track  sample  player 
playing a nice tune. 

     OVRI:
     The  bottom  border  has been opened as  in  so  many  other 
screens since TEX first did it in their BIG Demo.  In addition to 
that there is a starfield,  some bouncing logos saying XBIOS  MEN 
along with a very nice 3D landscape. The hills on the spinning 3D 
landscape  is  moving around in time to the 4  channel  MOD  file 
playing.

     NEWLINE I:
     This screen is the wirst so far !  There are scrollers going 
up  on either side of the screen with some sprites,  colour  bars 
and another bouncing scroller! The scroller flashes occasionally.

     FM I:
There  is  a scroller at the top going across the  left  and  the 
right border, some pretty big volume indicators in the background 
along  with  some  more small scrollers on  the  screen.  Do  you 
remember the game Space Ace ?   Well,  if you do you remember the 
skulls  in  the  background which have been used  again  in  this 
background.

     TCR I:
The entire fullscreen background is moving,  there is a scroller, 
some music and some colourbars.

     OVRIII:
     This screen is devided up into three different screens, each 
one  of  them  featuring scrollers.  First  there  is  some  text 
scrolling in and out of the left/right borders. 
     The   second  part  consists  of  two  big  scrollers   with 
scrolling background in the font,  one at the top and one at  the 
bottom  of the screen.  There is also an OVR logo on  the  screen 
wobbling and spinning. 
     The  third and final screen in this one big screen  consists 
of  the entire backgound scrolling about,  a  slightly  distorted 
scroller at the top.  There are also some sprites and a very nice 
sample.

     Vector I:
     A Phanlanx logo fades in and then out again. There is also a 
twist  scroller and some impossible to read text  saying  Vector. 
Some balls making up a circle along with a starfield.

     TSI Demo:
     This  demo appears to contain many good screens,  BUT  there 
are  also  some bads ones,  like for  example  this  one:  Volume 
indicators,  a  scroller  and some graffix faading  in  and  out. 
That's it !

     Vector II:
     There  are some colour bars,  a wobbling Vector  logo  along 
with a bouncing scroller.

     OVR V:
     The  Overlanders  sure are getting better and  better  every 
minute.  If you don't believe me,  simply take a look at  Ziggy's 
screens  which are marvellous.  As soon as you access the  screen 
you  ears will be filled with pleasure when you hear the 4  track 
tune.  There are also some great big OVR sprites flying about and 
over all the borders.  To make the screen even better there is  a 
cube  consisting of sinus dots spinning about and  flying  across 
all the borders. The dots also have some nice perspective, what I 
mean is that you can see when they are moving into the  distance. 
There  are  also  some smaller sprites  saying  Ziggy  and  other 
similar thinks.

     Genesis I:
     Hexadecimal numbers counting down,  the background begins to 
move and a scroller goes round and round in a circle, that's when 
I got bored and quit the screen.

     Blue Bird I:
     The  background  appears to be one of the main  features  in 
this demo as it is moving on every screen,  just like on this one 
here.  There is also a big bouncing scroller with colour bars  in 
it  with  a Blue and a Bird logo enlarging and shrinking  in  the 
background.

     OVRIV:
     A Starfield,  letters flipping into the distance where  they 
then slowly come to a hold and form a word !  This goes on and on 
until some filled 3D vector graffix appear on the screen ! Theses 
vectors  are  extremely fast and large at the same  time  !  Well 
worth taking a look at.

     TV I:
     A  scroller  is scrolling across the  screen!  Some  sprites 
saying European Demos fly about in the middle of the  screen.  At 
the top and the bottom are some pictures scrolling  left/right/up 
and down,  the effect being achieved by this is quite  nice.  The 
screen uses the top and the bottom border.

     NeXT I:
     They were the deadliest enemies you can ever imagine in your 
worst dreams but now they are FRIENDS. Yes, you gathered it, it's 
the two froggy crews how made each others life to hell by picking 
on each other,  but they have made it up now, next has even coded 
a  screen for their European Demos !  There is a  scroller,  some 
colour  bars,  3 layers of a moving background with  a  distorted 
logo at the top of the screen !  There are also 5 largish sprites 
and a sampled tune !

     ACF I:
     The screens appear to be getting worse the closer you get to 
the  bottom of the screen.  A star field,  a  sinus  scroller,  a 
normal scroller,  colour bars and a sampled tune make up the next 
screen.

     GUDUL I:
     I think that I have to take the above comment back that  the 
screen get worse towards the bottom.  This screen here is a  very 
nice Fullscreen as most of the screens in this demo are.  A  very 
nice  mod file goes along very well with the nice GUDUL  logo  in 
the  bottom  border.A scroller can also be found in  this  screen 
above  the  logo.  The  rest  of  the  screen  is  used  for  the 
marvellously looking effect with the colour bars going across the 
left and the right border.  To make the screen even better  Gudul 
has  worked out a nice technique to fade in text or even just  to 
built it up.

     Pendragons II:
     Another  great  fullscreen.  There are millions  of  sprites 
filling  up  the screen,  a nicely distorted logo  along  with  a 
scrolline and some musix.

     NPG I:
     Some  Volume indicators,  colour bars make up a nice  effect 
along  with the nice graffix,  the sprites,  paralaxing  and  the 
crystal scroller.

     RESET:
     Probably the most impressive screen from the visual side  of 
view.  While the program is working things out you are  presented 
with  a picture of the all so lazy donald duck.   After that  you 
can  see a fullscreen landscape made out of dots.  The  landscape 
goes across all the borders and looks very very impressive. There 
is also a scroller in the bottom border.
