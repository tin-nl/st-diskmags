                         Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     This demo was top of the list of the demo charts in issue  3 
of disk maggie.  Due to the lack of time and the full disk I  got 
only round to reviewing it now.

     The demo starts off like so many others,  there is a  ported 
picture  of  the Amiga Workbench disk.  After a short  while  the 
screen turns black and a man riding a monster comes on the screen 
and  shoots the disc which then falls with a loud scream  out  of 
the bottom.

     The  Overdrive  demo comes on a double  sided  discs,  a  82 
tracks 10 sector disc.  The demo runs on a half megabyte  machine 
but needs a double sided disc.

     At  first  I  booted  this demo by  accident  on  my  hi-res 
machine,  but just when I was going to switch my computer off,  a 
small demo screen appeared on my computer.  It's nothing  special 
but nevertheless it is very good for a monochrome monitor.  There 
is  a  flipping scroller,  a starfield and some  musix,  i  can't 
remember if there was anything else, but I think that there was a 
logo ! Great Hi-Res intro !

     The  loader  of  the demo is one of  my  favourite  screens, 
loadsa   colours  flashing  about,   scrollers  and   a   strange 
squreeching sound or it could also be sirene. When the program is 
loaded  a  picture appears on the screen with  some  explanations 
about the screen which you are about to see.  At the top right it 
tells you what the program is currently doing,  like for example, 
Thinking,  Decrunching,  Dehuffing,  hmmmm,  blocking,  hard work 
etc... And goes on like this until everything is depacked.

     The main menu is rather simple. A scrolline is in the bottom 
border,  some  sprites saying Phanlanx fly about.  To  reach  the 
different  screens  you have to fly a helicopter about  and  then 
stop in front of the doors and hit the space bar.

BIGGIE SPRITE II:
First  of  all  the is a simple scroller bouncing  up  and  down, 
later on some big srpites saying VECTOR appear on the screen  and 
fly  about.  There are some more small sprites saying  Ghost.  In 
order  to fill the screen they have included a bouncing  Phanlanx 
logo in the bottom border.

THE UGLY SCREEN:


THE DRAGON:
This  screen  doesn't quite work,  I don't know if this  is  only 
because of my computer or if it was badly coded (very  unlikely). 
The  letters  of the scrolline bounce individually about  on  the 
screen.  On the right side of the screen the scrollers fu..s  up. 
On the bottom of the screen are rasters moving into the distance. 
The  main attraction of this screen are the many biggish  sprites 
flying about,  the only problem is that they do not work as  soon 
as they move across the rasters in the bottom part of the screen.

BEAT DIS:
Remember this phrase ?  First TCB used it,  then TLB and now it's 
Phanlanx.  The  screen  is being squashes  together  but  extends 
itself again.  The content of the screen wobbles at the same time 
and  changes  its colours occasionally.  For the people  who  are 
hungry for more gossip and info there is a scroller in the bottom 
border.

Oh NOO !:
Ah well,  they sure do not like this screen here too much.  First 
they write that it is only a disk filler,  then you even have  to 
keep  the  ESC key pressed while you look  at  the  screen.   The 
screen I thought wasn't that bad,  but then again,  everybody  is 
entitled  to  their opinion.  The screen consists of  a  bouncing 
scroller,  a  sprite,  a  star  field in the  background  and  at 
least  but  not last there are three sections of  sprites  saying 
Vector.  

Dots in Space (DIS):
This screen has a very nice twist scroller in the top section  of 
the  screen.  There is another twisting Phanlanx logo within  the 
Twist  scroller which makes it look quite nice.  Some text  comes 
moving in from the distance and there are also some fireworcks.

Snirkel:
There are some balls spinning around an invisible bar along  with 
some  text in the middle telling you to wait.  You then  have  to 
wait  for about two minutes until the program  has  precalculated 
its  things.  When it finally gets going you can see  a  scroller 
spinning round in circles, moving along the edges of the screen , 
going partially in circles and at the same time around the edges. 
THIS IS A GREAT SCREEN.

Nibble Bender:
There is a starfield in the background, a bouncing sinus scroller 
and  at  the  bottom  of the screen there  is  some  text  saying 
Phanlanx made up of sprites spinning around a vertical axis. This 
logo  also has perspective,  which means that the sprites  shrink 
when they move into the distance.

Sync:
This  is  a  demo of the so famous  Sync  tracker,  some  of  the 
functions are implemented some aren't, still it is a great demo.

Overlanders:
It's  the  Overlanders again,  they also managed to get  a  guest 
screen  into this demo.  Have you ever realized that there  is  a 
star  field,  or something that has something to do with dots  in 
every  screen  by  the Overlanders.  In this screen  there  is  a 
starfield in the top border, some sinus dots in the middle of the 
screen,  some  text  moving  up and down on either  side  of  the 
screen.  And  at  least but not last there is a scroller  in  the 
bottom border.

Times:
First  of  all  there  is an article  from  a  newspaper  telling 
everybody that Phanlanx is better than TCB,  but it is  expressed 
smoewhat more politely. When you have pressed a key, some sprites 
appear on the screen, what means some sprites, there are millions 
of  sprites.  The background is also moving about and in the  top 
right corner there is a fragment of a scrolline.

Bitmap Mania:
First  there is a jerky scroller,  which then speeds up and  then 
starts  wobbling,  followed  by some  musix.  Some  ugly  sprites 
appear, which later change to some nicer ones. Some scrolles then 
appear  going  up along with some more scrollers coming  in  from 
the right side with some colour bars in them.

Snurkel Scroller:
There are some balls flying towards you (this was done the  first 
time  produced  by  the  Union in the  Union  Demo).There   is  a 
scroller  going  across  the  screen  coming  in  from  the  top, 
disappearing on the right,  flying from the left to the right and 
so forth.... The scroller also has a shadow. 

Fullscreen:
The entire background is moving,  there are some scrollers moving 
from  the right to the left of the screen.  Above  the  scrollers 
there is a Vector logo bouncing up and down.


The Music Screen: 
Ther  is  a  scroller at the bottom of  the  screen  whereas  the 
entire  screen  has  been filled up  with  devices  showing  what 
instruments are currently being used.

The Bouncing ball:
First  of all there are some red and blue sprites  moving  around 
filling the entire screen.  Then there is a starfield coming  out 
of  the  screen.  There is also a scroller  moving  around  which 
exists of sprites.  This scroller has a shadow on the bottom  and 
the  scroll just spins about and does various  other  things,  it 
looks marvellous.  The scroller also has perspective.  THIS IS  A 
VERY VERY GOOD SCREEN.

The Reset:
A flipping scroller, a starfield, a juggler and a tube.
