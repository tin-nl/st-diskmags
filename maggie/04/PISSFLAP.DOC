                     REVIEWED BY THE LUST BOY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER

     All right,  this review does not need to be as bloody formal 
as  all  the others as this one is hidden.  Pissflaps II  is  the 
sequel to the first one which was already very good.  To  explain 
to  you what the game actually is about I should start  with  the 
Amiga.

     Once  upon a time on the Amiga there were some  little  kids 
wanting  to have some porns to play with,  so what they did  was, 
they  digitized pictures from films and included  some  digitized 
sound with it.  The sound usually is some kinda moaning.  You are 
then  asked to wobble your joystick as fast as possible in  order 
to  score  enough  points  to get  through  to  the  next  round. 
Depending  on  the  speed  you  move  your  joystick  about,  the 
pictures' animation and the sampled sound speeds up. 

     Then  there were some little kids on the Atari ST who had  a 
pretty similar idea.  These little kiddies called themselves  the 
SUBHUMANS IN TURKEY (what a strange name,  by the way,  they  are 
not really from Turkey).  Now anyway,  they had the same idea and 
tried to fulfill it as best as possible.  The pictures are  great 
quality, the sound is also very very good, so there is nothing to 
complain about. Apart from the fact that  the sample always stays 
the same speed, the demo/game is very good. 

     All the discs are double sided and as the first one only ran 
on  a megabyte I have no idea whether or not the second  one  has 
the  same problem.  I do not think so though as the game  reloads 
after very sequence.

     For  the PISS FLAPS II PORN demo exist 5  data  discs,  each 
data discs contains about 5 different animated sequences some  of 
which are pretty damn disgusting !
