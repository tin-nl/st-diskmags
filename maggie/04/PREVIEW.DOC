
          COMING SOON! - Whats what (or not) for the future...
        ********************************************************

CIH - 7-12-90.........

Firstly, from last month, EPIC has now moved to the "first quarter 
of  1991",  and  seems set to miss as many release dates  as  it's 
illustrious predecessor F29 RETALIATOR..  POWERMONGER, ZIPHOS, and 
until recently,  CORPORATION are on Amiga only at the moment,  but 
VAXINE, and SIMULCRA are out on the ST now....

Coming  'Real  soon' (HAR HAR..) ie,  before Christmas,  hoping to 
see,  DAMOCLES  MISSION  DISK  1,  the ST version of  POWERMONGER, 
SPINDIZZY  WORLDS,  SPEEDBALL  II (?)..  Of course,  all the usual 
stuff  will be out,  CHASEHQTURTLEROBOHARDERDRIVINESWAT,  starring 
that bloke with the huge muscles,  and big gun...  Funny how these 
don't get delayed by six months....

Moving to that dreaded "First quarter of 1991" We can look forward 
to some really good releases,  such as TURRICAN II,  MIDWINTER II, 
B.A.T,  DEUTEROS  (the  Millenium  2.2 follow-up),  CYBER  ASSAULT 
(which is being previewed at the Computer Shopper show, so hope to 
get  some first impressions real soon..) FLIGHT OF  THE  INTRUDER, 
EXTERMINATOR (Severely weird...) the other DAMOCLES MISSION  DISK, 
KILLING CLOUD....

A  special mention to the forthcoming VIZ computer game,  in which 
you have to WAGGLE YOUR JOYSTICK (Fnarr Fnarr...) and PUMP FOR ALL 
YOUR LIFE IS WORTH (Woo Woo!...)

And  of  course,  the forthcoming LOST BOYS GAME (this  isn't  the 
title by the way..) to be released by Thalion... Anyway, whats the 
point of having your own Disk Maggie if you can't use it for cheap 
self-publicity eh???

I think that'll be it for the moment..  I'm sorry if this is a bit 
short,  but  I  am  very tired at the moment,  owing to  a  wholly 
successful  attempt  at  getting  paralecc..   parra...   paralet. 
ARSEHOLED! last night and am short on sleep...

I hear it should snow tomorrow, oh goody......

ALL for nowt! CIH..
