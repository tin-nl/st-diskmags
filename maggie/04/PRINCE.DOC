 REVIEWED BY:- GUESS WHO? (The clue is there is a 'C' an 'I' and a 
'H' in there....)

You many know that the land they used to call Persia is now modern 
Iran,,.  You  may also know that the real-life ex-royal family are 
not the most welcome people there anymore,  in fact if any of them 
were to set foot in the place, it would probably be the last thing 
they would do...  Which makes you wonder why anybody would want to 
be  'Prince  of  Persia...' However this game  is  set  back  when 
knights  were arabian,  and the job of royalty was merely one long 
cushy   number,   with  beautiful  large  breaste...AHEM  doe-eyed 
princesses by your side, and no built-in death-threats or anything 
nasty like that...

However,  in  this  tale,  you start at the bottom (just like real 
life..)  alone  and weaponless,  you have to rescue  the  Sultan's 
daughter  from the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar,  he has a unique line 
in marriage proposals, IE) "One hour or you die!!"  As the man has 
severe  B.O.  and  garlic breath,  and an extensive collection  of 
'Jive  Bunny'  records,  the beautiful princess awaits  her  fate, 
which is where YOU! the heroic rescuer comes in..

The  problem  is,  you only come in,  after twelve lengthy levels, 
which  is a real bummer for princess-rescuing purposes,  but gives 
you plenty for your œ24.99... How does it measure-up as a game??

As  mentioned  before,  there  are twelve levels of  the  tyrant's 
castle,  of  which,  I  have only seen a couple so far.  These are 
arranged  on a platform-system with the obligatory chasms,  jumps, 
crumbly  bits,  and  passage-ways...  The  background graphix  are 
reasonable,  but  the best graphix are kept back for the  sprites, 
the hero in particular is superbly animated, as he runs, shuffles, 
leaps,  swordfights,  and  goes  ker-splat onto the spikes at  the 
bottom  of  that chasm I told you about earlier....   all of  this 
available from your joystick,  the hero adapts to the situation he 
is in, if a guard waving his scimitar-thingy appears, for example, 
our  man  draws  his own sword.  In the game,  objects,  and power 
potions are there to be picked-up, and portcullises to be opened..

Sonically, the game benefits, from several sampled ditties, at the 
beginning, and at appropriate places in the game. The tunes have a 
suitably  'eastern'  theme,  and there are  sampled  spot-effects, 
throughout the game... Particularly effective, is a horrid screech 
that you get, when spikes emerge from the bottom of the pit...

There  is a lot of this game,  and I have only seen the first  two 
levels,  there  is  also  a nice cinematic intro-sequence  at  the 
beginning of the game..  Playability-wise,  the controls are quite 
easy to learn,  and intiutive, once mastered. Also, the levels can 
be mastered, once you learn what to do at the right time, the only 
thing which is essential, which I haven't sussed as yet, is sword-
fighting, but at the moment, it is still fun watching my character 
die!!! (You heartless sod!! - ED) 

What more can I say? - Over to the ratings....

GRAPHIX:-  89% - Particular mention for the excellently drawn  and 
animated  sprites,   having  them  jump  around  and  die  several 
different ways makes it all worthwhile!!

SONIX:-  79% - Not a soundchip in sight!  Several suitable  tunes, 
and sampled spot effects help the atmosphere thing along...

PLAYABILITY:- 84% - Once mastered, your character is superb fun to 
play,   the  levels  require  perseverence,   but  are  ultimately 
beatable..

OVERALL:-  89% - I personally liked this game,  it will need a bit 
of time and effort,  if you are playing it,  but I think should be 
ultimately worthwhile.......
