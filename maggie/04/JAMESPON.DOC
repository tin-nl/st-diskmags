  Reviewed by CIH for TLB Maggie.....

(Put finger in ear,  stare at blank screen) Yes,  another review by 
me,  CIH  and  usual big problem as to how to get going,  as  once 
you've  started  and  got the first paragraph  on  screen,  things 
usually  flow  from  there,  the problem is,  how to  get  started 
though... ( Oh it's a hard life being a reviewer on Maggie...)

Well  bugger  me!  here  we go (One of the weakest ways to  get  a 
review  going  actually..) James Pond,  given to us  by  Millenium 
gives  us  a  novel twist on the 'cute platform  games'  theme  by 
introducing James Pond,  the fish-like Secret Agent (As opposed to 
Billy,  the  fish-like goalkeeper...) In an ecologically sound and 
'right on' series of twelve missions... 

These start of with the relatively easy 'Liberating Lobsters'  and 
go  on  to guiding fish away from radioactive  canisters,  rooting 
through shipwrecks,  and other 'green' objectives..  Sounds dull ? 
well  it isn't as there is masses of this game to play,  and loads 
of  enemies to contend with.  These take the form of enemy  crabs, 
snails,  guard-fish (Try to imagine fish-like Bulldogs...) a stork 
or heron which swoops down and grabs you, if you come too near the 
surface,  and also skinheads/boot-boys, when on dry land!!! and on 
one of the levels,  what looks like the ghost of a pirate captain, 
amongst others.

You  can  also  bump  into  other  hazards,  such  as  radioactive 
cannisters,  which does not help your health any. Graphically, the 
prevailing  standard is excellent,  with loadsa colours  onscreen, 
more  than you usually get on an ST,  it has the kind of  graphics 
more often associated with the better demo crews, not usually seen 
in  a  typical game,  as both the background and sprites are of  a 
very high quality, and the screen moves around very smoothly, with 
little  flicker.   Playing  the  game  involves  often  retrieving 
objects,  and placing them in a predestined spot elsewhere, whilst 
nobbling  enemies  with  bubbles blown by  James  Pond,  and  then 
jumping  on  them  A  la Rainbow  Islands  to  convert  them  into 
bonuses..

On  the way,  you can stumble across all sorts of bonus screens on 
the  levels,  where  you collect objects for extra points  in  the 
time-honoured fashion,  and at the end of a level, you are advised 
if  you  have  completed  a given mission or  not...  It  is  also 
possible  to lose your lives whilst in the game...  Coming back to 
the  graphics  and  sound,  I said these were of a  high  quality, 
featuring  graduated  colour backgrounds and  sky,  using  several 
shades  of  the ST palette,  and the sprites are small,  but  very 
clear  and  well  drawn,  the bonus objects being  suitably  weird 
(False teeth for example?). Sonically speaking, an unobtrusive ST-
soundchipped  tune,  but  a  tune which does not grate  after  two 
minutes,  with other tinkly bits and ditties for the bonus levels, 
endgame bit etc...

Overall, this is quite a nice game, on the cute theme, involving a 
very  high  standard of production,  and it isn't too bad to  play 
either!! Whilst not a Mega-fantasmagorical experience, if you have 
spare time and cash, certainly worthwhile...

Finally, Some percentage ratings:-

(Shock horror! goes against all CIH reviewing practices..)

It also fills space!!!!!!!

GRAPHIX:- 89% - Very high standard of production, some of the best 
seen for a platform game..

SONIX:-  60ish%  - Nothing spectacular here,  but  nothing  really 
awful   either  (See  main  body  of  review  for  more   detailed 
comments..)

PLAYABILITY:-  84% -  Good for this type of game,  not as inspired as 
Rainbow Islands, but still on the right lines..

OVERALL:-  85% - A good effort from Millenium,  can be recommended 
to fans of the genre (And indeed to a wider audience..)

This has been a CIH review 2-12-90

(That was'nt so bad,  the percentage thing, after all, I think all 
reviews from here on will contain these from here on (Doffs cap to 
MR  GIBE!) Please bear in mind some earlier reviews in this  issue 
do not have these...)
