           ...Ever Wanted To Create Your Own Menus...

At last, the lamers dream has come to a P.D. Libary near you...

This piece of code appears to have been coded by The Disk Master 
and on my version of the disk I had several decompacted menus 
along with a disk editor and file packers. This is a great bit of 
programming considering it appears to have been coded in STOS.

What you do is load in the program, enter the password which is 
Madonna, then load in your decompacted menu and picture.

Once this is done, you adjust the code using the F1-F4 keys and 
when you have a picture in view you press the button to save 
code. The picture will appear to be ok, but all the colours will 
be wrong. The best way to make sure that your picture is ok is by 
making sure that there are no shadows which make the picture look 
wierd. This is easier done than what it sounds.

Using the editor, you can save the picture from the menu to degas 
form. This enables you to steal your best picture from what menu 
you want. If you do this the CORRECT colours will be saved with 
the picture. If not than press the SAVE key and the program will 
save a new file with your new picture.

Once you have your working menu you can then load the disk editor 
and change the scrolling text. You can also use this to change 
the file that you load in.

Once this is done - vollia - you have a working menu that you can 
then pack.

My contact has told me that there is a Version III of this 
program, but as yet, I have yet been unable to get my hands on 
it.

Still this program can be obtained from The Lost Boys P.D list if 
they decide to stock it. Once I can get my hands on Version III, 
I will send a copy to them.

Thanks... 

I do not accept piracy, but as it is part of life on the Atari, 
then this HACKERS utility may as well be spread in the P.D. 
network. After all, all we're doing is pissing off The Disk 
Master by spreading his code, after all the work he must have put 
into this. Still, if he spreads other peoples work, then we 
should spread his.
