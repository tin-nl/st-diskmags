A Lost game found again..

Here is another tale of a bygone relic of Atari Corp's foolish 
involvement with such strange concepts as computers, and computer 
games, back in the 1993 Jurassic era.. Raiden was one of the 'big four' 
high profile Atari releases for the Falcon, hidden away from public 
view, whereas at least Llamasoft, Road Riot 4WD and Steel Talons have 
made it into the daylight..

Raiden has never really had the dignity of a proper release, as far as 
I am aware at least, but there are 'alternative' means of getting hold 
of, and reviewing this particular lost work, all in the name of duty of 
course!

Raiden was developed for Atari's own software label by Imagitec UK, and 
was intended as a reasonably faithful arcade conversion of the fairly 
famous vertical scroller blaster of the same name.. (It was interesting 
to note that one of the Playstations debut games was a more or less 
arcade perfect copy of Raiden!)

Okay, what have we here on the disk? 

Click on it and the nearest SVGA screen mode messes up.. Keep trying in 
a variety of resolutions.. Still no good.. Desperately switch monitors 
to a nearby RGB/TV.. At last, we're off..

After a fleeting darkness, the first signs of life coalesce around a 
coloured atari logo with a cheap looking colour cycling effect.. A much 
nicer Imagitec logo swiftly follows.. Then someone at Imagitec must 
have been busy with the raytracing software as a screenful of rendered 
fuji looms against an impressively artificial landscape, at the same 
time, a cheery but cheezy 12.5 khz modfile or sampled sound track kicks 
in, interesting to note that this is the lowest sound quality the 
Falcon can support, and was probably robbed from the unreleased STe 
version of the game? A series of title credits, hi-score tables, and 
levels from the game load in.. You want more?

Reaching for the joypad, an action diminished in novelty potential by 
the long years of familiarity with, and support for this implement, but 
brand new, and a major selling point of the game back then..

Immediately, the music changes to some sort of soundchip burble, a 
criminal waste of the Falcons audio capabilities, and I think the sound 
effects are mostly chip-based as well, which suggests to me even more, 
that large parts of the game were 'borrowed' from the defunct STe 
version!

The graphics are happily more up to the mark, with a 256-ish colour 
screen, again, nothing that couldn't be done as well with a good team 
in sixteen colours.. This one seems to run in overscan mode, so someone 
at Imagitec actually read the Falcon programming documentation? 

Unfortunately, this admittedly early effort tends to fall down in 
comparison with comparable genre members, the closest comparison can be 
drawn with the sadly unfinished 'X-Moon', and that scene based 
production is a vastly superior product in presentation, and also seems 
to flow better as a game as well.. However, Raiden does have the 
supreme advantage of being available in a fully finished format..

Raiden isn't too bad in the gameplay department, but tends to lean a 
little too much to the 'get killed too easily' school of arcade games, 
where the aim was to gobble as much spare change from passing 
schoolchildren in the shortest possible space of time.. It can be said 
to imitate the arcade original a bit too closely perhaps? The joypad 
comes into play as you either hit button 'A'  for a neverending stream 
of bullets (or whatever power-up you've got at that time), and also 
button 'C' for a limited number of screen-clearing smart bombs..

Handy tips to keep going.... Yes, you get killed very easily, but the 
number of smart bombs is replenished with each new life.. Keep lobbing 
those bombs to get you out of trouble, it's a criminal waste to lose a 
ship with two or three bombs unused.. A hyperactive, but easily 
disposed of end of level big sprite guardian, and you're off for more 
of the same in level two..

The game is classic Raiden, either an arcade shoot-em-up you'll love 
for the cult status, hate for being too hard, or be totally indifferent 
to as a crassly commercial product subsequently overshadowed by more 
original home-produced releases..
 
I doubt it would have been worth the hefty asking price Atari would 
have charged for it.. But if it had been one of the first 'Falcon 
enhanced' games on the market, back in 1993 as Atari originally 
planned, it probably would have sold respectably before something 
better came along..

Ratings..

Graphics - 65% - Okay for 1993 standards, with just a little bit more 
effort put into the pre-game presentation aspect than the main game..

Sound - 50% - Very poor for a Falcon game.. Atari always seemed to 
downplay their computers internal sound capabilites, all their stuff 
uses the lowest replay rate and sounds dull and lifeless.. Chip effects 
ingame are a sign of a rush job as well..

Playability - 75% - Not too bad, a fairly faithful reproduction of the 
murderously tough original..

Overall - 68% - A collectors curio with a shootemup game tacked on..
