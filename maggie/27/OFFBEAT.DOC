- Advanced techniques for swing and polyrhytms - 
------------------------------------------------ 

Note:This was originally written for pc trackers so I had to do some 
changes to get it all up to date with the atari trackers. As I use so 
many trackers and so many computers (atari/amiga/pc) I have problems 
keeping them all apart :-)

 [Introduction]

While much of tracked music is 4/4 with a vengeance, there is good 
reason to venture beyond the perceived [time] limitations of the modern 
tracker and to go forth and multiply [or divide, as the case may be] 
with abandon.

First, let us examine the perceptual barrier known as the pattern...

 [The Pattern]

From the early days of moddom, the pattern was 64 atomic units in 
length; no more, no less. Given that one wanted to write 4/4 pop music, 
this neatly worked out to equal four measures allowing the use of 
sixteenth notes. [16*4=64]

While Scream Tracker, Protracker still imposes this strict 
fragmentation, others like Graoumfracker, Fasttracker go beyond, 
allowing variable size patterns; to a point.

The point is, however, that regardless of the format's patternization, 
small miracles can be achieved if you just go linear, and ignore 
pattern boundaries. Your mind may not thank you (conventional 
tracking's much easier) but your listeners probably will.

We'll be working towards this, however, so let's start off by seeing 
what improvements can be made within the confines of the 64 note 
pattern and the beat itself.

 [The Beat]

Even sticking to 4/4 time signatures, not many of us really use the 
beat, at least with our melodies. Trackers (the people, not the tools) 
who are rhythmically inclined like to alternate speed, say between 06 
and 02 for shuffle feel, etc. Problem being, what if you only want one 
channel to shuffle? Enter our friend, note delay and his trusty 
companions.

 [The Triplet]

Note delay lets us break the tracker atom to a great extent, bringing 
things such as triplets to life. Along with note cut, note repeat and 
arpeggio, we can bring some feeling to our music.

Let's start off with the triplet then.

The value we set for speed will determine the number of divisions 
possible. For mixing eighth note triplets with sixteenth notes, the 
default 06 will suffice. It's a good idea to decide before-hand on the 
smallest quanta of your piece.

 Below, we have one beat:

              Track 1         Track 2         Track 3

         | C-4 01 -- --- | C-4 02 -- --- | C-4 03 -- --- | 
         | --- -- -- --- | C-4 03 -- --- | C-4 03 -- ED2 | 
         | --- -- -- --- | C-4 03 -- --- | C-4 03 -- ED4 | 
         | --- -- -- --- | C-4 03 -- --- | --- -- -- --- |

Assuming these are rhythm tracks, lets let track 1 be our four-on-the-
floor bass drum, track two our sixteenth open-closed hi-hat, and track 
3 our triplet ride cymbal. It really doesn't matter, however.

Notice that using this technique, we only use the first three beats for 
our eighth note triplets. The first occurs squarely on beat one. The 
second is delayed 2/6th (1/3rd) of beat 2, and the third, 4/6th (2/3rd) 
of beat 3. If you want a run of triplets, just lay in EDx effects, 
copy, paste, and enter your notes over-top.

Probably the best way to start grasping what is possible would be to 
try entering some classical sheet music. Look for the smallest quanta 
needed: perhaps there is a 7:4 run in an otherwise smattering of 
eighths. Some university level big band jazz charts would also be a 
good bet in your search for rhythm.

 [The Swing]

Note that jazz charts (expect perhaps the most elementary) will not 
explicitly notate swing feel; it's to be added by the performer. 
Basically, every odd eight note in a measure is to be played for about 
2/3rds of a eight note triplet, while every even eighth is to be played 
for the remaining 1/3rd.

Try entering the following four bars of eigths (excerpt from Miles 
Davis' Serpent's Tooth) into one channel using your favourite tracker:

         Bar 1: G-4; E-4; D-4; C-4; C#4; E-4; A-4; G-4; 
             2: F-4; D-4; F-4; A-4; D#4; F#4; B-4; A-4; 
             3: G-4; E-4; G-4; C-5; G#4; C-5; F-5; E-5; 
             4: D-5; C-5; D#4; F-4; E-4; D-4.

Now go and add note delay to every second eighth-note. Initially, use a 
value of four, which would be technically correct given a speed of six. 
Swing is a feeling, however, so try adding some using other values. 
Smaller values will bring you closer to straight-eighths, larger will 
add more swing: to a point. At moderate tempos, I like delays of two.

If you want to be accurate, use a Bb-tuned instrument like a trumpet, 
perhaps muted.

 [The Pattern Break]

If you want to get going on alternate time signatures early, chances 
are that your patterns no longer end up with 64 prime divisions. 
Consider using the Break Pattern [d00] effect on your last 'beat' to 
jump ahead to the next pattern if you come up short. Alternately, 
switch to a tracker that allows a definable pattern length.

 [Still dont get a thing?]
 
Well audio examples (as gt2) using these techniques (shuffle, 
notedelay, poly) can be mailed to you for free. Just mail me with the 
topic "maggie27 article" and I will have it sent to you within a few 
days.
