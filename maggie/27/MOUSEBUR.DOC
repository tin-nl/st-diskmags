
The Mouse Burster!!

A hot-line  to end the  cold  war  between  your old-style Atari Mouse 
port and new PC mice!!

Now I'm sure this is something  that  you  can  happily  do  without if 
you are addicted to your grey Atari corporation  issue lump.. If you 
are happy using something that is less  a  mouse  than  a lump of 
cheese, cheese that is six months past its  sell-by  date, then you 
should leave this article right now, and go and read something else 
instead..

The  rest  of  you,  those  people  interested  in  pushing  something 
altogether better and smoother around your desktop, read on!

There have been replacement mouse  almost  as  long as there have been 
Atari ST's and their ilk..  All  of  these have offered better results 
than the bog standard (and  bog-grey!)  Atari  effort, but since Atari 
became equated with commercial death, supplies  of these have dried up 
somewhat..  Another  perplexing  fact  seems  to  be  that  all  these 
replacement mice died within six  months  of  getting them, either the 
buttons stopped working, or the cable  went, whilst the old grey brick 
just carried on.. The  Atari  mouse  is  truly the Lada of the mouse 
world, sad-looking  and  uncomfortable,  hellish  to  drive, yet built 
like a Russian T72 tank, with a knack for keeping going when all the 
others lie down complaining..

Now there is an alternative, built by  a native genius in new Zealand, 
and with distribution  willingly  taken  up  by  ASP Developments, the 
Mouse-Burster arrives on the scene.. Very simply, the Mouse Burster 
lets you connect the latest Microsoft and System 3 PC compatible mice 
to any Atari ST/Falcon series computer..

It isn't a lot to look at, a ribbon cable sneaks out from a blue blob 
concealing the adaptor board, this end plugs in to the awkwardly 
situated Atari mouse port under the machine.. From the other end of the 
blue blob protudes a serial mouse adaptor where the PC mouse plugs in 
to.. That is it, no special software to set it up, it merely translates 
the signals from a PC mouse to a format understandable to the Atari 
mouse port.. Not too pretty to look at, but by heck, it does its job 
well!  (Actually, I've got a very early production version, the 
aesthetic side of things may well have improved in line with ASP's 
skills in assembling the things, so don't let the 'blue blob' 
description put you off in any way!)

When using a PC mouse, you can either happily settle for a conventional 
Microsoft compatible two button model, which gives you the benefit of 
massively added responsiveness compared with the grey brick, even for a 
cheap mouse.. Otherwise, you can take things a step or two further by 
opting for a System 3 three-button mouse..

This takes the signal from the Mouse-Burster and lets you use the 
middle button as a 'double-click' from a single click! Also, more 
exotic gadgets such as tracker balls, light pens, and those very weird 
mice with a wheel in the middle are accessible with the help of this 
little beauty..

There is a tiny bit more to it than that, as there are a series of four 
very tiny switches built into the Mouse Burster main body which affect 
what it does at any given time depending on what is plugged into it..

Switch One - On for Mouse System mouse, off for Microsoft Mouse.

Switch Two - On for third button as real third button, off for double-
             click mode on middle button.

Switch Three - On to activate Mouse wheel (if present), off, wheel does 
               nothing..

Switch Four - On for slow screen speed, off for 'normal', ie, "fast" 
              screen speed.. 

When I got the Mouse Burster, I also got a cheap System 3 type mouse, 
which only switches to three button operation by holding down one of 
the buttons at initial power-up.. However, even with cold resets, the 
mouse is still recognised as a three-button device, just remember not 
to switch the machine off totally, or you'll have to start again.. 
Leaving the button unheld means that it reverts to boring bog-standard 
two button operation.. 

Now I tend to find that three-button operation is very appealing, and 
cannot really be asked to double-click normally any more!

Once the mouse of your choice is set up, all you have to do is forget 
the Mouse Burster is there, and just treat it as though it is a normal 
Atari mouse, that is, apart from the extras, the ice-rink smoothness, 
and not forgetting the chance for your Atari to throw off its 
institutional grey leg-iron of a lump to lead a normal mouse, free from 
the cares of.... Ahem!

 Advantages..
Lets you use new style PC mice..
Unobtrusive, once plugged in, just forget about it..
Once plugged in, you don't have to fiddle about underneath to change 
mice anymore!
System 3 tri-button operation supported..
Lets you use other related serial devices, light pens etc..

 Disadvantages..
Errm, none..
