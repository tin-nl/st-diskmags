Öç'Binliner Preview Screens

Tragically Lost Out-Takes department..

I'm sure you're all aware of the very sad 
story behind these screens, and we 
needen't go into graphic detail about what 
went wrong.. (Scars still aching, etc..) 
Well, for those folk who might just be 
reading 'Maggie' for the first time, there 
was a chap called 'Tat' who was one of the 
very best coders on the Falcon.. He was 
widely respected, and he won a reputation, 
not only for spot-on coding, but also for 
excellence in demo design (in my opinion, 
the really difficult bit to get right!)

The 1997 'Sonoluminescenz' demo broke new 
ground for Falcon demos, and his long 
awaited follow-up, titled 'Binliner, was 
perhaps the most eagerly awaited release 
for the Falcon.. However, for a number of 
reasons, which we won't go into, Tat 
suddenly stopped work on this demo.. It 
would be a great understatement to say 
that the Atari scene was shocked and 
surprised by this action..

Fortunately,  he has decided to release the
work completed so far, in the form of the 
source code, and also the three preview 
screens completed. This is their story.

The first screen is an early version of a textured and continually 
generating fractal landscape.  It is very quick, and obviously DSP 
powered. A screengrab of this was seen in the early days of the 
Binliner diary.. It is quick, but buggy looking, and a somewhat 
early looking preview, probably superceded by later code..

The  next  screen  is called 'Freaky',  and is some kind  of  very 
elaborate  tunnel  feedback  effect,  most aptly  described  as  a 
visitation by a psychedelic version of one of the giant worms from 
'Dune' (by me, at least!) This has so far produced at least one 
"Hey wow!" exclamation, from one of the System Solutions guys, 
when I first showed it to him!

The piece de resistance,  and the best indicator of what the final 
finished  article  would  have looked like,  is  a  screen  called 
'Worship'.  It  is  an  amazing  sequence,  with  beautifully  lit 
multiple  spinning 'angels',   bio-
luminescent blobs flying around 
them,  set  against  a dark and brooding worldscape..

The 'viewer' isn't restricted to a single perspective on the 
scene, as the 'camera' flys around, zooms in and out, and peers 
at this bizarre  machine age  cyber-ritual from above..  
Probably the 
most  complex demo effect screen ever seen on the Falcon,  and one 
which  makes the loss of Tat from the Atari scene,  all the harder 
to bear, as I'm sure the rest of 'Binliner would have been of a 
comparable standard..

With the release of the source code completed so far, 
Just maybe,
someone else can pick up where he left off?
