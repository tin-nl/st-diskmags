lot of mail privately, but here are a few bits suitable for public

Hi Chris,

Nice to meet you at the show, pity the rest of Maggie team didn't come 
over to say hello. I look forward to the next issue. It's a real 
struggle keeping up, there's so much in every issue they take ages to 
read and I've got various issues on the ST and Falcon. Are they pretty 
much identical in terms of editorial content?

>They were mostly in the bar!

Oh, right. Did you stay for the after-show party? I couldn't manage - 
my driver wanted to leave and I had a sore throat from talking all day 
(over the loud music!)

About Zelda... I loaded it and the intro sample played OK through my 
Jam PRO box, but as soon as the game started, the sound only came out 
of the Falcon's built-in outputs. Actually, this was only true *after* 
using some other program which had obviously set the audio matrix. I 
believe God Boy resets it, from my testing. 

To refresh your memory, can you persuade Mr Pink to make sound also go 
to the DSP port for future releases? This way it can be output by any 
connected external DACs. Saves wear and tear constantly swapping the 
leads between sockets. It's simply a matter of setting the audio 
matrix, he'll know how to do it.

By the way, I read MSG's POV raytracing article in Maggie 25; if he has 
an unaccelerated Falcon his FPU will be running at 16MHz, the 33MHz 
written on the chip simply means it is rated to run OK at that speed by 
Motorola. 33MHz is tested by CENTEK to be the only reliable standard 
for overclocking to 50MHz, as the CT2 does (there is a socket for it, 
but I'll go through it with you when you see it). So going by rough 
calculations, if he were to render that scene on the CT2 it would be 
three times faster than his current F030/FPU machine! (Although 
admittedly, the floating point performance is not a patch on the 
68RC040, that thing flies)

Hi Chris!

Argh, I'm working flat-out and there's so much to take in my brain will 
explode. Furthermore, I've just got off my butt and installed this hot 
new PC product, Creamware's Pulsar. Hold it right there, before you 
snap my head off, it's actually a complete operating system in its own 
right, which happens to be on a PCI card (*so if someone wrote the 
software, Hades and Milan could use it!), and as expected comes with PC 
software. 

 *Developers, are you taking note!? - Ed 

This card has four Analog Devices SHARC DSP chips, the current fastest 
floating point DSPs on the market. I won't bore you, but the software 
is essentially a CAD program for designing and building virtual 
synthesizers, multi channel I/O (sampling) and digtial mixing... and 
the amazing thing is the power of the card, which has such high 
precision it can emulate classic analogue synths with a level of 
accuracy that has astonished everyone at all the big music fairs. It's 
been 7 years in development, we're the first in the country to have it 
and I've ignored it since they arrived! 

The fact it currently only runs on a PC is irrelevant. The Creamware 
guys are so clever that they've actually bypassed many of that 
machine's stupid quirks (their tripleDAT ISA hard disk recording card 
is one example, everyone said it wouldn't work. It does) Well, enough 
of that waffle, I'm not even a musician so what would I know! :-)

The technology does fascinate me though, the Creamware stuff is 
actually very efficient, and they are actively going against Windows NT 
because they are pissed off with MS moving the goalposts all the time. 
Pity the PC happens to be the most popular computer else this product 
could be for Atari :-(

I read your A4000 article in M26, its audio system actually has a very 
innovative design, which I've simply not seen in any other computer. 
Technically not the best way of doing things from an audio quality 
point of view, but it's so different that I can't help but like it! (I 
used to mock the Archie as a school lad!) 

Basically, it has *one* audio DAC, an 8-bit mu-law flash convertor. To 
get 8 channels of sound out of this, it uses time-domain multiplexing 
in the analogue output stage, for summation of the logarithmic sample 
data (doing this in the digital domain is potentially very messy, 
unlike with linearly quantized data as used by most digital audio 
equipment). Depending on the sample period and number of channels 
playing, an individual digital audio stream can have a sample rate 
anything up to 333KHz!!! (Compact Disc is 44.1, STE maxes out at 50)
