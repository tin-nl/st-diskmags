Please note:- This is the ***newest E-Mail address***.. Unlike any 
previous  address,  this is a direct internet account in my  name, 
with  a  termination point on my keyboard..  All  official  Maggie 
related  correspondence  should now come to here..  "About  bloody 
time too", I hear you all cry!

On  a  related note,  regular hassling by E-Mail will  follow  for 
regular contributors.. It's good to talk! 


Maggie Web Pages.. The latest!!

***************************************
Maggie Online! now at:- rg.atari.org
***************************************

All other previous Maggie pages have closed down, or changed the 
focus of what they do.. This simplified address, thanks to the 
growth of Atari.org, is a lot easier to remember as well..


Who do I contact concerning this diskmag?

CIH's address(es) (see above)..

(The inevitable plea)

Maggie  is  a 'happening' diskmag,  that is,  it 'happens' as and 
when  we have enough articles to do a new issue..  If you want it 
to 'happen' a bit more often,  then some more articles might be a 
good  idea..  Our regular contributors would really enjoy the odd 
new perspective now and again, and who knows, it could be the key 
to eventual fame and fortune for you..

Now  I'm not going to threaten to close the mag if no-one  writes 
in  like  some other diskmag editors tend to do,  we enjoy  doing 
this too much to do that, but I'm really enamoured of the idea of 
sitting  back  and watching a whole host of  third  party  talent 
flood into the mag, prodded along by helpful threats from me, the 
editor..  I  often  have  dreams about it..  Come on,  make those 
dreams come true!! - Write today!
