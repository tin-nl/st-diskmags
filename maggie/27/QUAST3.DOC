6/8 - the gathering
*****************************************************************

(Baggio) I got up at 8.30pm, tired as usual, packed my bags and
got on the buss to Stockholm. After about 1 hour i had
made it to Stockholm and then it took approx 30 mins
to get to Green / 2 life crews place. Green and I spent
about 30 mins at his place and then his father gave us a
ride to Nynaeshamn where we were supposed to meet up with
Deez and Viking from Mind Design.

(Green) Finally there, we began to look around to see if Deez and
Viking had got there yet. Well, we didn't see them at
first, but we did notice these two guys, with the smallest
car in the world (we thought at the time, but compared to
most polish cars, it was actually at least two sizes
bigger)... After some betting between me (green) and
baggio, we took the courage to go and check. It turned
out that the two guys with the small car indeed was Deez
and Viking, and me (green) had lost a beer...

(Viking) I got up real early and packed my stuff in the car.
After eating some breakfast and kissing my girlfriend goodbye
I drove to pick Deez up.
As always when I'm about to go somewhere I was early, so Deez's
parents offered me some coffe. His parents is probably the nicest
around!
We packed his stuff in the car and said goodbye to his girlfriend.
We where now on the way to Poland...

(Baggio) We only had to wait
for about 15 minutes before we noticed that Deez and
Viking had allready arrived. First thing we gasped about
was the car we were supposed to travel in, it was old
and very small. We put our stuff in their car (well, 
Vikings car), but when we tried to get into the car we
realized that the car wouldn't be able to carry us all
plus all our luggage.

(Green) You bet'cha sweet ass that car wouldn't carry us all.
The weight of all 4 of us, plus all the equipment and
luggage, made that car to litterally lay on the ground.
The suspension wasn't nearly as strong as it would have
needed to be.

(Viking) My car is a 1977 VW Polo (no need to say more!) :)
(Baggio) This was a problem ofcourse, but
we soon came up with a solution to this problem...We
would simply have to travel twice from Gdansk to the
partyplace and same procedure when we were leaving the
party.

(deez) Hmmm.... the car WAS very small but it never struck
me whether it would carry us.. I just wondered if we all could
fit in that car :) (as Green Tommy and Baggio weight pretty much :))

*****************************************************************
The Journey...
*****************************************************************

(Baggio) Anyway, eventually we got on the ferry that would
take us to Gdansk. The cabins on the ferry was way better
than we expected them to be, so we dumped our stuff there
and decided to have a beer or two before dinner. The beer
was quite cheap (about 20sek / beer) and the bar itself
was ok. After this we had some food (which was quite expensive
and not good in anyway) and then hit the bar again to get
boozed up. Some of us stayed up quite late and also got
quite drunk. 

(Green) Yepp, the food-thang...  Well, it was quite cheep
on that boat. So we decided we'd go to the a'la carte
restaurant to get some decent food. I ordered sirloin,
and the others ordered other kinds of meat. We were all
pretty surprised when we all got the same, tasteless, white
goo... (and it wasn't the only time we saw THAT I might add)
Well, dinner spoiled, and somewhat disturbed over the fact
that no eatable food were to be found on the boat, we followed
the saying: beer is food, and went and got a few beers.
Later that evening, we did however find that the cafeteria on
the boat actually had sandwiches that wasn't that bad. 

(Viking) "Surprised" (mentioned by Green above) was a
complete understatement. I've seen dogs eating better food
for about 1/4 the money... :)

(deez) I kinda liked that food actually :) The fries was probably
the worst thing, tasted like old McDonald fries. But the steak was
good I think.

*****************************************************************
7/8 - the arrival
*****************************************************************

(Baggio) We arrived in Gdansk at approx 11.00CET. First thing that
happened when we drove of the ferry was that the polish
customs didn't want to let us get into "their" country.
Their english was quite horrible but eventually we managed
to understand that we were required to get some kind of
car-insurance license before we could go on with our
journey. The insurance was about 200sek and we didn't
really give it any second thought. Now we had to find our
way to the party and decided that Viking and Deez should
go first and unpack our luggage and the come back to pick
us up. Green and me went to a cafe at the ferry terminal
to have something to eat and drink.

(Green) Finally in Gdansk, we decided to have breakfast.
At the terminal they had a cafeteria, and while Deez and
Viking were going to the party with the equipment, me and
Baggio sat there and ordered an oldfashioned hamburger.
When the burgers finally arrived, both of us noticed this
white goo in the middle...

(Baggio) After this we decided to check out Gdansk for
awhile and exchange our money for some polish ones.
The town itself looked like it had not changed since the
2:nd world war, and everything looked very dirty. (At the
end of this trip we got to see the centre of this town
which indeed was very kewl though).

(Green) Sorry baggio, I don't agree with you, Gdansk was not
dirty, however, it was rundown, but I suppose that was what
you meant, right? It was interesting too see though, and I
must say that the sheer number of "kiosks" in poland is 
amazing! You can find one in almost any streetcorner.
(A kiosk is a VERY small store that has a very small selection
of merchandise, usually tobacco, soda, candy and papers.)

(Viking) While finding the way out of Gdansk I was amazed by the 
towns dirty, kindof ghetto-style.
It was very hard finding the way out of Gdansk.
The main reason for this was probably me not understanding
the traffic-signs (I can't even understand the swedish ones!)

(deez) Yeah!! Hehehe.. Gdansk was pretty different from swedish
cities, some parts did look like 50years old but some other parts
was pretty nice. Ofcoz we had problems finding the way out but it
could have been much worse. I think we only took the wrong way one
or maybe two times really.

(Baggio) After we had exchanged our money we decided to get
back to the place where we was supposed to meet up with
either Deez or Viking. We sat there for almost 5! hours before
Deez and Grey / MB showed up. Appearntly they have had
difficuties in finding the party place and therefor had been delayed.

(Green) After waiting around for Deez and Viking for 3 hours
me and baggio started to plan the revenge we would bestow upon
them for being so late. After 4 hours our minds was coming up
with all these pictures of Deez and Viking, laying bound and
robbed on the side of the road, or even shot.
Finally Deez and Grey showed up and me and Baggio kicked Deez
ass.

The party
(Viking) Me and Deez arrived to the partyplace about 5pm.
We could'nt find anyone to give us directions in english.
People in Poland don't seem to get too much of the western
culture (like movies, newspapers etc.) or english-education
and therefore don't communicate that good with foreigners.
(This is just speculations, someone from Poland correct me
if I'm wrong!)
We tried finding Grey / Mystic Bytes because Deez told that
he was supposed to hold some seats for us.
After 1 hour (or more, (deez) yes.. make that 2.5)) we found him
and indeed, he got some places for us.
I like to mention that Grey is a not only great guy, he is also
the one linking us non-polish-speaking swedes to the rest of Poland.
He worked VERY hard as a interpreter throughout the whole party! :)

(deez) I'd like to add to this that polish drivers are crazy, they
almost killed me and Grey on the way back to Gdansk. And another reason
it took so long for us to get there was that Grey didnt know the way
in Gdansk! He didnt know where the harbour was so we had to drive
around and finally we found a sign saying "Sweden - ferry", YES!!

(Baggio) After we had
kicked Deez ass around for making us wait for 5 hours, we set course
for the party place in Elblag. It took us about 1 hour to get
there. The partyplace was being held in a school of some kind
and looked quite ok. Once we had paid our entrance fee we meet
Earx / fun, 505 / escape and m0d / tscc. We talked to them
for awhile and then then got hold of some tables right next
to them. After unpacking and pluggin in all my computer stuff
i realized that my ste hdd refused to start. Some of us spend
an hour or two but then realized it was of no use trying to
fix it. Green offered to take my disk with him back home and
fix it for me, so i gave it to him.

(Viking) Ah!! Baggios broken HD!  I think this was a tactical
move by Baggio for not finish his demo during the party! :)
Ofcourse, the evidence was insufficient for prosecution. 

(Green) The first thing I noticed when we came to the party was
the heat! and humidity. The air in the big gymnastics hall the
party was held in was some 40 degrees and humid. It took some
getting used to...

(Baggio) Lucky enough i had brought
some of my sources on floppy so i asked Deez to copy devpack
(deez), hehe.. Baggio cant even spell devpac correcly :)
to a floppy, which he did. Deez and Viking was eager to start
coding on their 4kb intro and so they did. Sqward / MB showed
us the demo they would release and it looked bloody nice. m0d
/ tscc was busy drawing some graphics for it and also showed
us his contribution to the upcoming graphicscompetition.
Later at night it was time for some of the compos!
In the middle of the night they also started some kinda rave-dance
activities in the main hall. At first there were alot of people
dancing but as time passed by, most people left. At approx 4AM
i decided that it was time to get a few hours of sleep. So i
laid down under our table and used some clothes as a pillow and
went to sleep quite fast.

(Viking) Personally I think the compos were to many, as I'm mainly
just interested in the Atari/Amiga stuff.
Therefore I only watched the Atari-compo in full...
In the Atari Falcon demo-compo "Teardrop" made first place.
This demo was not too bad, but I liked Escapes "Illness" and
Funs "Fungle Beats" as much.  Hard to say if the right demo won!!
  
(Green) Yepp, I remember that "Rave" party. In the beginning there 
were a lot of people there, but at the end, there were just 2 guys
dancing with eachother for several songs. Pathetic.
Anyway, while the party was at it's best, I was strolling around
the hall, talking to a lot of people. Since I'm the guy I am, and
I'm more than fairly interested in cool hardware, I
ended up talking quite a bit to a polish fellow from "Pascud",
a company in poland that sells atari, amongst other things.
He showed me a cool IDE interface for the ST/STE that connects
to the cartridge port, booting and everything.
They had developed it themselfes, and was manufacturing and
selling it. The price was good, so I ended up buying one and also
buying a memory expansion module for the F030, which they also had
for a good price.

(Viking) Ohhnoo, the rave party!!!!
I really hate that kindof music!! (I think it's called Goa?)
To me, it could make nice background music in a demo running for
4-5 minutes, but playing that shit in 4-5 HOURS(!!!) is just
destruction of brain-cells.
It's like the Duracell-bunny, it's keeps on going, and going, and going...

(deez) And that damn baby dancing on the bigscreen, why come to a
computer-party and dance rave??? One ca do that at a club, thats my
opinion. Apart from that I agree with viking, too many compos, this
actually caused me to fall asleep so I missed the atari 8bit ones :((

*****************************************************************
8/8 - The great hangover
*****************************************************************

(Baggio) I woke up at about 9am and felt that my back had not liked sleeping
on a stonefloor. At this time Deez and Viking was still asleep,
but Green had been up all night drinking some whisky we bought
at the ferry.

(Green) Yepp, was up all night, drinking bad whisky and talking to
people, so I sleept most of this day...   well, a few hours anyway.

(Baggio) At 10-11pm Deez and woke up and wondered (like the
rest of us) where the showers were. Eventually we found the showers
and also realized that alot of other people was as eager as us to
get a shower. We had to wait for approx 30mins before we were able
to hit the showers. (Which btw looked like something from the 40:s).
Before returning to our table and start coding again, we fetched
some food from the party's 24hour fastfood store. The food there
was quite ok, but for some reason they put curry ketchup on all the
food which really tasted horrible. When we got back to our table
i decided to have a look at Immortalize and ofcourse i found some
bugs which i had not seen before. As i was to lazy to fix it at
this time, i decided to code some on my vectorball routine and some
other stuff. Deez & Viking (yes, the sleepy creature had woke up now :))
spend most of the afternoon trying to finish their 4kb intro, which they
almost did. They did, however, decide not to release it at the party.

During the afternoon/early evening, the people who had organized the party,
showed some demos from various platforms on the big screen. I was especially
impressed with the Atari 8bit demos since i had not seen any of those 
before. It's incredible what some coders can squeeze out of these old
computers.

(deez) The showers, yes.. kinda strange, they really looked like they
were from the 40's, and the situation was improved by the fact that all
polish ppl occupied it for themself, ei. 1 guy at the time, so we had to
wait for more than 30mins I think.
But we (me, baggio and Green Tommy) entered the showers together, (there
were 4 or 5 showers) and sang the Swedish national anthem :)) The polish
guys must have thought that we were crazy!
And the toilets! I know what toilets can look like in public places but
this was the worst I've ever seen!!!! (no more comments)

*****************************************************************
9/8 - The escape
*****************************************************************

(Baggio) At 6am some of the partyorganizers tried to wake us up and told us
that we couldnït sleep now because the major of Elblag was expected to
arrive shortly. I didn't give a shit about this and went back to sleep
for 2 hours or so. At approx 11am the priceceremony started and the
people who had won the compos got their prices. The prices was rather
ok but the prices for some compos were terrible. The guy that won the
4chnl compo got a cd (just a normal music cd) and some other lame stuff.

(Green) Yepp, the prices was somewhat, err, misaligned. One guy could win
a stereo, or a synth, and the next guy, that won the "harder" compo would
get just a CD or some other pathetic stuff. According to the journalist of
the norwegian mag "techno", (a swedish-polish guy), one of the winners was
so disturbed by this that he actually said (in polish, no guarantee for the
translation, since I don't speak polish): "Gee, I'll really, really remember
this town for the utter poverty here"

(Viking) Have to complain at the prices too, mOd / .tSSc won a color-printer
for his excellent 1st-price picture that he could'nt use with his Atari.
Anyhow, it was allright, I've seen worse situations where the 1st price in the
demo-compo was "a free meal-of-your-choice" from the cafeteria!!!
 
(Baggio) Sqward / MB who won the falcon demo compo won a falcon and m0d / TSCC
who won the grapics competition won a printer (which did not work
with his falcon...). After this event was over we packed our bags and
put the stuff in our car. Deez & Viking took the car to Gdansk but
me and Green didnït really want to wait for hem to come pick us up
so we took the train (with Grey, Earx, Sqward) back to Gdansk.

(Green) Time to get home. The train was PACKED with people, it was
not like the swedish railroads where they almost has to stick a gun to a
persons head to get them to go by train. As luck would have it, the train
station in Gdansk actually was located next to a McDonalds. Needless to
say, we raided the place, and actually got meat that looked like meat for
once. After the meal, me and baggio grabbed a cab down to the ferry
terminal. Ofcourse, we got hustled and ended up paying 10 times more for
the trip than it was worth. (deez) Yeah!! polish cab-drivers rules! :)

(Viking) Well, I guess I have the last word here (!).
Overall I think it was a cool trip, cause you learn something new everytime.
We had some problems (with my car, delays etc.), but we solved them and
we had (at least me) a good time!
We now look forward to visit the Error In Line '99 in Dresden.
I think this will be alot easier, because people know english there and
I've been in Germany before, so I won't get any surprises!!!! :)

(deez) No viking, I get the last words here :) (editor of this article)
I also enjoyed the trip very much but I have to complain about some stuff.
Me and viking were interviewed for a polish newspaper by a girl (probably one
of the best looking girls I've ever seen!) but she didnt speak no english
so another guy had to translate, the only problem was that he thought he could
speak english, but he couldnt :)) His english was so bad that we didnt
understand much of what he said so I wonder what that article really
contained :)

Another funny thing was when we were back in Gdansk, me and viking visited
the same McDonalds that Baggio and Green Tommy had been to a bit earlier.
When we looked for a place to sit I saw the impossible, a class-mate from
spring-term! I couldnt believe
it!! I knew that she was polish but I didnt know she was to be at McD in
Gdansk at the same time as me!!! Thats what a call a small world :)

*****************************************************************

Very last words here...
I (deez) think I might do this trip once more, now that I know what Poland
is like. But it was like being transfered 40years back in time sometimes.

I really hope we havent offended anyone out there with our comments about
Poland but we all know what happened 50years ago and the following years of
non-democratic (more or less atleast) governments. If someone is offended
then we must apologize but this is what Poland (and Quast'98) was like
from a swedish perspective.

ps. Baggio first typed what he could remember and then handed it over
to Green Tommy who then gave it to viking and he finally mailed it to me
so I could put it all together and finish it, thats why some text parts might
not make much sense.
