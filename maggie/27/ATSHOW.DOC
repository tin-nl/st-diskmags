- The STAFFORD ATARI COMPUTING CONVENTION- 14th November 1998 -

  Morning. . . . .

Breath steams gently in the cold still air, we huddle ever more tightly 
in our clothing, our exposed hands dart in and out from the cloth 
sanctuary of warm coat pockets for the briefest time possible whilst we 
unload.. All around us, several other standholders are in various 
states of bleary-eyed setupedness.. Just then, the power goes on for 
the first time that day,  the nearest Falcon screen stutters 
uncertainly to life with the bootup Fuji logo glaring starkly from the 
top left of the screen.. Looks like we're back on the case, and about 
time too!


 Maggie Team returns to a UK Atari Show shock!

Obligatory background bit! Wake up at the back and pay attention 
there!

It was thought that with the ending of Mike Goodmans interest in the 
previous UK Atari Shows, that this was the end of the line for such a 
show.. However, where a vacuum developed, Atari Computing were sucked 
in.. Rather than try to repeat the Atari-only format, they cleverly 
combined with the organisers of the AMS show, which is a glorious mix-
up of box-shifters for contemporary and less contemporary PC stuff, the 
keepers of various relic status 8-bit computers, and one or two 
activities which might be most charitably described as semi-legal at 
best!?

Still, more of that later, as they say..

This time around, it was a party of four going up to Bingley Hall near 
Stafford, myself, Felice, Pete Augustin, a figure better known from the 
Dave Hollis ST Plus end of the scene, and Nicky (light of my life and 
the major distraction from getting very much Maggie done too early!)

Stopping overnight at Nicky's place in Northampton, we all had an early 
start, some earlier than others, as Felice had not quite communicated 
his intention for a 6am start, as opposed to the painfully too early 
5am start, which he had suggested in the first place! - Errm, still, 
never mind.. The next hot topic of interest was the car full of 
assorted junk that Felice and Pete were taking to Bingley Hall to 
sell.. Somewhere along the line 'people' were considered as an 
afterthought, but we managed to fit in, just..

Internet fans might well be interested to see that this show even got a 
mention in NTK News (The weekly high-tech sarcastic update for the uk!) 
It also looks like their pro-ST inclinations shone through somewhat 
here as well!

         Oh, those swanky West Coast WEBZINE 98 guests may be living
         the high life this weekend, quaffing the complimentary
         Chardonnet and waving to their adoring crowds from their
         large, specially-commissioned floats, but we know our roots.
         We'll eating simpler fare at the ATARI COMPUTING CONVENTION
         at Bingley Hall, The Staffordshire Show Centre, Stafford,
         this Saturday 14/11/98 (1000-1600GMT). The simple bran of
         the monochrome Atari ST: the healthy spring water of its
         still cheery exponents. And we'll be breaking bread with the
         Atari's traditional enemies, too. By a happy coincidence
         the Atari Convention takes place at *exactly* the same time
         and place as the ALL COMPUTER SHOW, which will be
         chock-a-block with ageing Sinclair fans, Einstein
         enthusiasts, Coleco Adam advocates and, we're sure, the
         occasional Amiga loser. Entrance fee UKP3, and bring your
         boots. There's still time for one more kicking.

Anyway, where did that main text get to?

The journey was mostly dark  and  uneventful,  I  even  went as far as 
having my  eyes  closed  for  the  majority  of  it,  as  I  was  in a 
prematurely awakened early morning state..  I  think everyone else had 
their eyes closed too, possibly even  Felice, who was driving.. Still, 
we didn't hit anything on the  way  in..  The signposting to the venue 
was generally good, although there  was  a  little  bit of last minute 
confusion about  the  venue  location,  and  we  went  a  fair  way to 
Uttoxeter before turning around and shamefacedly retracing our steps.. 
We briefly got tangled in the offloading  of an antiques fair, and one 
perilous reversing manouvre later got us  to the proper show venue just 
around the corner..

One novelty of this venue was the ability to drive right in and unload 
at the stand itself, which we  gladly  did..  This meant that the hall 
was largely open to the outside air, and was pretty damn cold to start 
with, some of us  never  did  quite  get  warmed  up,  even as the day 
progressed..

The venue resembled  an  auction  hall,  and  I  would  not  have been 
surprised to have seen some  bloke  with  a  donkey jacket calling out 
bids in a strange sing-song  'auction-speak' voice, whilst cattle were 
dragged around the place.. The  very  high ceiling and concrete floors 
added to the  general  coldness,  it  was  most  definitely 'coats-on' 
conditions, and quite possibly 'tents-on'  as well.. Thin but menacing 
looking clouds started to form near the top of the hall, and it looked 
like snow  for  a  time..  Unloading  and  setting  up  provided  some 
distraction from the fridge-like conditions..

Shortly after, Matt Smith turned up, his contribution to the day was a 
PC laptop for the presentation of the realtime article, and a shitload 
of Falcon gear, all brought to  the  show  in an original c.1968 
'hippy-mobile' VW Camper Van..  There  was  no  sign  of  Scooby-Doo in 
this latterday 'Mystery Mobile, but Matt played an admirable Shaggy..

It was a little while after 9am, and we were up and running..

Briefly checking out the rest of  the Atari contingent, most are still 
in the mid-way  stages  of  setting  up  their  stands.. However, just 
across the way,  is Floppyshop  with  their  neatly laid out table, an 
object of great  beauty  resides  proudly  in  the  middle,  but Steve 
Delaney is nowhere to be  seen..  Good  old Steve, always there before 
everyone else, and probably  checking  out  the  bar for some pre-show 
refreshment..

I wait, hoping that no-one else  will  see  and snap up the Desktopper 
cased Falcon on sale  there,  the  only  such  machine  on sale at the 
entire show..

Eventually, Steve does come back, and my credit card and I pounce.. 

Two hundred and fifty pounds later,  I  make Felice and Pete Augustins 
hearts sink by bringing back to our stand this  Falcon,  shortly to 
become 'number two computer' in the CiH hardware dynasty.. They are 
given very strict instructions not to sell it..  Pete  and Felice have 
all their spare stuff on sale, and it would be very embarrassing to 
come back with more than we started with.. Not to mention  an  even  
tighter squeeze in the car than on the journey down..

Meanwhile, somewhere nearby, a realtime article blinked into life..

Matt Smith returns from the  high-priced  and  lukewarm thrills of the 
'Balcony Cafe' upstairs, warning us that  a  bacon roll is likely to 
consume most of the profit  from  a  days trading.. Undeterred, Nicky 
and I go upstairs, Nicky  suffering  visibly  from the effects of the 
cold, and with the only other source  of heat being the hand-dryers in 
the toilets, some urgent relief was needed.

The food  is  indeed  highly  priced,  and  it  is  with  some forward 
thinking, I remembered to bring some  packed lunches.. Just this once, 
we decide to try out what they offer, and wish we hadn't.. The gallons 
of tea do help a little with the coldness problem though..

By this time, the doors have opened and the punters are thickening.. I 
arrive  back  to  my  Falcon,   which   has  been  left  in  MagiC-Dad 
multitasking mode, with GEM  Demo  and  Aniplayer  going  all over the 
place.. Soon I get Felice's  machine  running  Maggie, and I revert to 
several more traditional demos, whilst awaiting some arrivals of well-
known faces..

I think it is Mr Pink  who  arrives  first, he having sensibly avoided 
shuttle-bus induced depression by getting a  taxi to the venue (Oo-er, 
looks like Mr Pink is starting  to  think  like someone who is earning 
proper money, one of the  petit-bourgoisie,  if  he was still  running 
his previous alter-ego' Student Mr  Pink',  I'm  sure he would have 
tried to walk the several miles  out  of  town  to get here!! I bet he 
buys a car next!)

 Mr Pink introduces me quickly to the pleasures of his latest Godboy X 
game, Zelda, just then,  further  arrivals,  consisting  of Rich Davey 
(Requiem) and John Nott (VoGue), adds to the tension..

I enjoy telling Rich that the only  Falcon for sale in the entire hall 
has already gone my way!

 A slightly sleep-deprived looking  Tat  arrives  as well! Soon after, 
Kev (Sh3) and Malc (MSG) arrive  to  make  it a heavily Reservoir Gods 
represented event, but not quite all of them, as Ripley is kept  away  
from this show by University work commitments..

Sometime later, Kev 'Taff' Davies hits the show, announces he only has 
a short time to look around, and disappears again, never to be seen 
anymore.. (Although subsequent email comments by him suggest that he 
got as far as placing an order for a Milan whilst he was there!)

They take themselves off around  the  show,  and eventually to the bar 
upstairs, leaving the rest  of  us  to  the  dubious  pleasures of our 
stand.. At some stage shortly after, I  take myself off to have a look 
around at the fully-developed show..

As an 'All-Formats' show, there  is  a  lot  more  than just Atari, or 
even, just PC box-shifters, although the latter were depressingly very 
much in evidence..

There was a token contingent from the obscure computers division, with 
the Tatung Einstein user  group  present..  The  Tatung Einstein was a 
computer which was very much an  also-ran  in  the heady days of 8-bit 
proliferation, back in the mid-eighties.. Memory serves me that it was 
powered by the ubiquitous  Z80  CPU,  and  that  it tended towards the 
higher end of 8-bitdom with the  ability  to run CP/M, with a massive, 
for the time, 80k RAM. One  other  feature  is  its useage of the very 
hard to get Amstrad/Hitachi 3 inch  disks..  To  look it, it is a very 
boxy machine, Tatung having  kidnapped  the  style  consultant for the 
Commodore Pet, and it was running some very average looking text-based 
applications.. Chatting to the two  'dads'  on the stand revealed that 
there was a  disk  magazine  for  it  and  their  scene  was generally 
"quiet".. Tat later commented  that  there  had  never been a computer 
more misnamed than this one!

The QL users group had quite a big stand too.. The Sinclair QL powered 
by a cousin of  the  68000  or  68030  in  our  ST's  and Falcons, the 
Motorola 68008.. Again, there didn't seem to be too much excitement in 
evidence, the QL  always  having  attracted  the more self-consciously 
'serious' user, the one  graphics  orientated  demo  running on their 
stand seemed to have been written in BASIC on  day  two  of  the 
machines life.. There was more of a buzz of  ambition  here,  the QL 
always having attracted upgrades and modifications, now with  the  
ultimate in QL-dom, a 68040 powered version of the beast, the Q40!

The Q40,  as  you  might  expect,    goes   some  way  beyond  the  
basic specification, as the briefly seen  SMS-Q operating system (seen 
about 3-4 years ago in a  ROM  cartridge  for  the  ST, anyone remember 
it?)  is still alive, and making its way back  to  its  native  
platform.  Such luxuries as SVGA graphics quality is promised, and 
stereo (wait for it!) 20 kHz sound.. This is just  a  specification  
sheet  at  the  moment,  but  surely at least a prototype should be 
forthcoming for the next AMS show?

There was  also  an  Atari  8-bit  user  group  (Tyne  &  Wear), which 
threatened to do something  interesting  now  and again, huddled under 
the 'Atari' part of the hall,  but they were looking  a bit 
overshadowed by the much larger and noisier 16/32 bit representation..

Even in the box shifters  lair,  there  was  a fair amount of 'second- 
user' (or fifth user!) hardware, much of it in  an advanced condition 
of dilapidation.. As well as the more conventional CD-Rooms and PC 
upgrades, there was also an electronics  stall,  with  a  load  
of   testing  gear,  radio  ham equipment etc.. Another stall  was  
mostly selling well-abused Amstrad PCs, the really early 1512 or  1640  
series  for  25 ukp, fine if your computing ambitions are extremely 
limited..  Also  there was one stand who had raided the bins  for  
their  ex-Gwent County Council Acorn BBC Master series computers, all 
of which had remained strangely unsold by the end of the show..

There was even one  stand  selling  Playstation emulators, and offered 
certain other  'services'  to  enable  UK  model  Playstations  to run 
'imported' games! 

Of course, it was the Atari stuff  we were really there for, and quite 
a good showing was  put  on  by  the  attendees..  Milan,  the new TOS 
computer (68040 for a  sensible  price)  had  its first showing here.. 
Impressions were mixed, some  people  (AtariMad)  ordering  one on the 
spot, others, mainly on the Falcon side,  not so sure.. Milan does seem 
to offer a great new platform for  GEM-legal software, and will attract 
a great deal of attention from that side of the scene..

There was also other new  hardware,  with  Titan  showing the first of 
their new productions, the Eclipse  graphics  card adapter from Istari 
of Sweden.. This was  impressively  showing  a  Falcon stretching into 
some very high resolution modes,  normally  the domain of contemporary 
PCs.. Essential for those  people  with  graphics  and  DTP software 
that would benefit from the higher  resolutions  on offer.. The new 
'Smurf' package from  Therapy  springs  to  mind..  The  one  that a 
lot of people will be waiting keenly for,   the   Tempest  
'040/Coldfire accelerator was not at the  show.. Shipping dates are 
(optimistically) before Xmas for Eclipse, and "1st quarter of 1999" for 
Tempest..

System Solutions did have a  Centek  Centurbo  2 board on their stand, 
with what looked like a  representative  of  Centek on there as well.. 
This 50mhz '030 on a daughterboard, with lots of other nice things like 
FastRAM capability, and an upgradeable BIOS for booting the Dolmen O/S 
looks like a winner, with a lot of 'scene' people in particular opting 
for its brand of Falcon turbocharging..

System Solutions also had MagiC  6  on  sale,  upgrades  of CAB 2.7, a 
massive splurge of pro-music gear, and a huge range of  software as 
always.. The English edition of the Jinnee desktop wasn't quite there, 
but as I'd spent heavily already, that was just as well..

Whilst on the System Solutions stand, Shiuming Lai took the opportunity 
to show me around his very high-spec system, with a few suggestions 
about future Reservoir Gods productions such as making use of the DSP 
port as an additional audio 'out' for higher quality sound..

Other notables  were  the  Upgrade  Shop,  with  an  impending 'Veloce 
Falcon' upgrade, that  is,  a  40  kHz  68030,  and  FastRAM..  In the 
meantime, Veloce STe was on sale..

Chris 'Robot Wars'  Crosskey,  was  fresh  from  giving  a stilted and 
unnatural performance in front of  the BBC 2 cameras, and manning the 
stand of ASP (Abingdon Synthesis  Developments).Their  main line of 
interest was the PC  mouse  adapter  'Mouse  Burster'  (purchased  pre-
show and reviewed elsewhere this  issue)  and  some  deals  on the 
SCSI-Burster case.. Even here,  we  were  not  free  from  the  threat 
of massively powerful upgrades  to  basic  Atari  hardware,  as  
something  totally transforming a bog-standard ST is on  their  list of 
'things to do'! I went behind the scenes a little  later  on to sort 
out 'Megaplayer' on Chris's Falcon, which initially didn't want to talk 
to it, and came up with a TOS error number undreamed of  by the Atari 
designers! I calmed it down and persuaded it to come out of the trees..

Electronic Cow were there too,  with  their  latest production, 
'Squash-It', a new sample editor for all ST's and Falcons, and show 
offers on their other products as well..

Also, Atari Computing had  a  very  big  and well-presented stand with 
back issues on  sale,  subscriptions,  and  the  Renegade CD (reviewed 
elsewhere in here!) They were also memorable for having several jars of 
boiled sweets to hand, which nearly made up for  the  high cost of food 
elsewhere in the hall, and of which, several people keenly availed 
themselves to fend off that old complaint, Atari show starvation 
syndrome, (esp. Matt Smith!)

Floppyshop managed a good days  trading  (after  the head-start I gave 
them), and there were  also  such  other  activities  as Cyber Strider 
"Live" registrations at the show,  and  even  the  sight of Vic 'Alexi 
Sayle impersonator' Lennard, ex-editor of Atari World and ST Review 
flogging his spare gear as well..

The aptly-named SHAG had  a  stand,  promoting  ST  Plus  in its paper 
edition Gordon  Storey was as keen to sell bits of the stand to you as 
ever, but their new game Michigan Mike II wasn't  ready  in time for 
the show.. There was also a showing from the Coventry Atari Users group 
as well..

 I would say, that  to  a  casual  observer,  or  PC  owner, the Atari 
presence looked healthy and well-organized..  The  comment in NTK News 
about the "Simple bran of the monochrome Atari ST"  didn't really 
apply, as the majority of Atari Computers running, were either Milans, 
or Falcons running with a vastly upgraded desktop and/or some kind of 
SVGA swanky big screen mode, or even our Falcons on  the  Maggie  stand 
running a lot of stuff that came under the category of 'non-standard' 
but highly interesting.. 

"Healthy spring water of their still-cheery exponents." - I wouldn't 
dispute the validity of that comment though! 

There were several  favourable  comments about the 'impressive Doom 
clone' on Matts Falcon ('Running',  of course!) We managed to fit in a 
fair number of demos, and Rich  Davey and Jon Nott managed to catch up 
with a lot of recent Falcon productions..  The Reservoir Gods 'Twenty- 
Four hour game'  that  took  a  year  to  release,  Bunion Canyon even 
attracted one or two younger fans not intimately connected with the 
normal Atari scene!

Certainly, there was  nothing  there  that  any  Atari  owner would be 
ashamed of showing to their PC  owning  friends,  and quite a bit they 
would be very pleased to let them see..

Apart from  the  initial  early  morning  success  in  purchasing  the 
Floppyshop Desktopper Falcy, I also picked  up a rarity from the 16/32 
stand, a Jagpad, but in  a  white  case  with blue buttons! These must 
have been some of the ones made with the mythical Atari Corp sponsored 
STe versions of  4WD Road Riot and Steel Talons  in  mind,  but  
neither the games, nor the joypads ever saw the light of day..  Until 
now that is, the joypads at least must have been released by  the  big 
Atari spares warehouse sale by JTS some time ago.. Other items I  came 
home with were MagiC 6, and the Renegade CD-ROM..

Even Nicky was motivated to buy  something (some PC screen savers) in 
between bouts of shivering (it never got that warm during the day..)

Time went on, and the show was starting to thin out, the next question 
that was being passed  around  the  hall  was  "Where is the post-show 
party gonna happen?" A slightly lost looking Joe Connor paced the hall, 
promising to get an answer back to us, promptly paced out of sight, and 
never reappeared.. 

The  now very  merry  crew  that is the Reservoir Gods and Tat, 
reappear, and manage to extend their presence way beyond the time when 
a deeply bad-tempered public  address system is yelling for the public 
to leave around 4.00pm, so they can shut the place down for the night.. 
We  really  know  it  is  the  end  when  the  power  suddenly 
disappears, our Falcons being practically the last machines running in 
the hall.. (Or as Tat said with respect to this considerate act by the 
staff of the venue "It  is  now  safe  to  turn off your computer - 
Oops!") The realtime article was  safe  though,  having been saved and 
shut down just five minutes before..

Felice and Pete have had a  good  day,  the  only major item Felice is 
stuck with, is an Archimedes A3010,  an ST/Amiga style case version of 
the Archie that I've got..  No-one  told  him  it wasn't an Acorn show 
though.. Felice managed to pull off  an apparent miracle by selling an 
old EGA monitor as a VGA monitor  ("sold as seen" and "It'll just need 
a little work on the adapter guv!") Mind you, it was just for a fiver, 
which shows that you really do get what you pay for!

Before too much more time  has  passed,  we've loaded what's left back 
into the car, (and what I've  added  as  well!)  The car is a lot less 
congested, and it is with some relief that we get in out of the cold..

A short trip, which  threatened  to  become  a  long  trip, for Pete's 
lottery ticket, and we return  to  the  show  for the final stage, the 
'chill-out party' organized by Atari Computing..

This is found  in  a  suite  adjoining  the  hall,  and is thankfully, 
running at a sensible  room  temperature,  belying  the 'chilling out' 
label on the  tickets  (perhaps  a  'warming-up'  party  would be more 
appropriate?) There is a  large  'official' Atari Computing contingent 
there, most  of  the  Atari  stall-holders,  and  in  one  corner, the 
Reservoir Gods, and assorted bodies..  The Realtime laptop having made 
a surprise reappearance lurked somewhere near the entrance, thanks to 
Matt..

A pay bar cleans the last of our cash out, but some of the others have 
saved all their money for this time, as the general state of merriment 
of Mr Pink, Sh3, MSG,  Arnel  (whom  I  forgot to mention before!) and 
Carbon of Reject seem to testify..  (Tat  might have been as well, but 
he was always too sensible to  show  it) Requiem and Jon had gone home 
some time before, something to do with catching a train home?

We  are  also  treated  to  some  of  Chris  Crosskey's  'Robot  Wars' 
anecdotes, such as the first series  'mishap' where the show producers 
decided that transparent perspex safety barriers for the  audience  
might have been a good idea, when a cutting disk operated on one of the 
house robots  shattered explosively, and rained fragments of cutting 
disk onto the  first  four rows (some fragments penetrating the seats!! 
-  Fortunately,  this  was  a  dry  run  with  no audience present!) 
That most welcome of  innovations, food, makes an appearance before too 
long.. I go back for seconds, thirds, fifths.....

The realtime laptop is  unhooked  from  its  lonely  corner and passed 
around the group, Arnel taking a very long time to type in the Thermos 
flask joke (see realtime!), and several  comments by Sh3 and MSG, more 
or less 'out of their tree' are  made.. Nicky clutches onto me to try 
to get some spare body heat  warmth,  the very nice and almost saintly 
Pete Augustin takes over buying drinks for our little contingent, so 
after a while, I'm not in any more pain, then it is time to go home..

The journey back passes in a  slow void  of  tiredness, at least for 
Nicky and me..

Conclusion..

This was a welcome return to  Atari  show  time  in the UK.. The break 
from the previous format, which was  becoming stale and parochial, was 
very useful in giving people time to  consider  a new show, and in the 
case of developers, have  something  new  ready  for  it as well.. The 
general consensus from Atari Computing's own debriefing is that people 
enjoyed this show more, stayed  longer,  and spent more.. There seemed 
to be a bit of new life, and  the extra dimension of the 'All Formats' 
part of the show added greatly to  it..  It was refreshing to see some 
other minority hardware there,  and  perhaps  this  would  be one area 
where there should be more of in  the  future, say a bunch of mad-keen 
Sinclair Spectrum, Sam Coupe, or Commodore  64  users..  The  PC box-
shifters were inevitable, and couldn't be avoided,  but  served  a 
useful purpose in bringing other observers to see what  Atari computers 
and Atari people were capable of.. The Atari people rose magnificently 
to the occasion, with some of the most professional and upbeat stands 
in the hall..

The venue was a  bit  of  a  shock,  there  was  the novelty factor of 
driving in and unloading, but  also  the  chill-factor of holding this 
event in what is effectively a  big  cold  shed.. Still, it looks like 
this is where future Atari shows are  going to be held, so we'd better 
get used to it..

People, as always, were the best part  of the show, with several faces 
not seen for a few years  hitting  on  us  (hi Requiem and VoGue!) And 
with attendances from Sh3 and MSG, who were doubtful about coming down 
to the show.. It was great  to  see  Matt  again, we always thought he 
never  travelled  north  of  Watford..   It   even  looked  like  Mike 
'Tellygrumpy' James was going to make the  trip down, but he didn't in 
the end..

 So, a load of laughs, incipient hypothermia,  and skint at the end of 
it, - result!!
