Boom Bang-a-Bang? It's war again!

And as Xmas slides in, we face the spectacle of a mini-Gulf War part 
II, thanks to co-producers President Bill 'My trousers suddenly fell 
off' Clinton and Saddam 'hand caught in the anthrax jar' Hussein..

Any suggestion that these raids have been timed to distract attention 
from Pants-off impeachement proceedings are rabidly encouraged here!!

It will be interesting to see how the generally anti-war Liberal 
Hollywood celeb pals of Clinton are going to react to being neatly 
impaled on the horns of this particular dilemma.. Errm, condemn war, 
but war not so bad as it helps Clinton by delaying impeachment 
proceedings?? Might well lead to something along the lines of, "Hell 
no, we won't go, but it might be okay just this once as it gets our 
mate Bill out of the shit!"

Only slightly less unnerving, was the sight of our very own Tony Blair 
with his firm and resolute wig on, but coming across less as the 
definitive portrait of world leader-dom, and a lot more like a narked 
primary school headteacher ticking Saddam off in front of the whole 
school for assassinating the head of the history department when he 
stumbled on Saddam lurking unmentionably behind the bike sheds..

"And if the boy who was developing weapons of mass destruction hands 
them in after assembly, then no more will be said about the matter.."

Or even,

"If the boy who has been stockpiling chemical warheads doesn't come 
forward before the end of school, I will be keeping the whole Middle 
East in detention until he does!" 

Not forgetting our mate Bill, of course!

"But my trousers *really* did fall off by accident!!"

Acorn don't want to take the 'RISC'(Doh!)

Meanwhile, back in a slightly more sensible plane of reality, the big 
news for fans of non-Wintel computer platforms has been, no, not quite 
the arrival of the Milan, but the shock decision of Acorn Computers to 
drop development of their new generation 'Phoebe' ARM/RISC-based 
computer..

Less of a case of the phoenix (Phenix?) rising from the flames, and 
more of an unexpected and unwanted windfall of barbeque chicken 
portions due to the failure of said phoenix to assume flying mode?

Yes. it was apparently one of those 'business' decisions that Atari 
Corp used to be so good at making, basically to alienate the entire 
loyal longstanding customer base for a short term gain only apparent to 
the board of directors.. There may well be good reasons for not 
proceeding with Phoebe, but it marks another stab in the gut to serious 
opposition to world domination by Microsoft..

Some of the reasoning used by Acorn to explain this decision also fails 
to make sense outside of the rarified atmosphere of the boardroom, that 
is, they only saw a future for Phoebe with 'enthusiasts' so they 
decided not to bother!

Well then, does that mean that people who actively enjoy their 
computing pasttimes are the new pariahs, people to be actively 
discouraged? A new public enemy number one?! Do Acorn only want to get 
involved with disinterested and cynical people? But surely that 
describes the vast majority of Microsoft customers after five minutes 
contact with typical Microsoft products!! So it looks like Microsoft 
have got that market sewn up as well, no room at the inn for Acorn 
there either, sorry chaps! You cocked up that one beautifully.. 

Still, the usual wild rumours of rescue plans and buyouts of the 
technology are flying around.. So can it be as quickly settled as the 
Amiga rescue plan (oh dear!)

Epilogue - The suggested new name for Acorn is apparently to be 
'Element 14', after the periodic table of elements number for silicon.. 

So, it'll be Element 14 then, at Acorn House?  Doh!!


"Would you like a brick through that sir?"

Still, where outside forces fail, it looks like Microsoft themselves 
will eventually provide the means for their own downfall.. 

In a fit of corporate hubris, Microsoft are seriously contemplating an 
ongoing tariff or toll for using Windows!! It isn't enough to pay for 
the operating system at point of purchase of a PC, now they want to 
make people keep on paying to use and update Windows..

This isn't due to come in just yet, as the infrastructure, presumably 
on the Internet, won't be ready to the year 2001. (And don't forget, 
they've still yet to kill that Win '98 Millenium Bug!)

This leads me to think that the following may well happen for the year 
2001..

A). Many more people will be seeking the software 'support' services of 
a Mr E.Leet and all their kind!

B). Watch Linux 2001 really take off!


Departures..

(Total change of mood here, put sombre facial expression on now..)

A couple of departures, no consolation or face saving to be drawn from 
either of these, just bad news all the way.. Sorry..

Firstly, Tat's (non-fatal) departure from the scene, where for various 
reasons, he suddenly decided to drop work on the 'Binliner' demo..

There are very few coders of Tat's ability, and virtually no-one else 
with his overall artistic vision on the Atari 16/32 bit demo scene.. So 
this is a shocking and deeply saddening to us all.. (By the way, I hope 
there are demo people out there still who can prove me wrong on that 
'vision thing' statement?) 

There may be a small chance of some sort of future revival, but don't 
stake your life on it..

And if that wasn't bad enough..

 **Death of Tommy of Avena**
 ***************************

This was a suicide on the 19th November 1998.. I'm pretty sure more 
will be said about it elsewhere in this issue, so I won't go on about 
it here..

As I said before, sorry for that..


Accelerators, the Next Generation..
(Or, will he NEVER learn!)

Once upon a time sometime last year, we all had this really good idea..

We lusted after faster Falcons, and Dave 'Titan' Encill put on his 
beardy wizard costume with pointy hat to give us..... Nemesis!!

After a whole bunch of traumas, many of them self-inflicted, we met our 
Nemesis, and pronounced it well 'ard..

This was fine for a time, but the dread disease of 'Upgradeitis' had 
taken a hold, and more ambitious hardware was lusted after.. Now we are 
facing this all over again, this time with a two cornered fight between 
Centek and their 'Centurbo II', and Titans latest venture with an 
Afterburner '040 style fitment that promises to be a whole lot cheaper 
to buy, and easier to add than the old style Afterburner..

Titan seem to be ahead with the specification, an '040 clone chip, or 
even a Power PC chip running 68000 emulation at a humunguous speed.. 
They are also way ahead on snappy nomeclamature, the exciting and 
zingily titled 'Tempest' beating the limp-sounding 'Centurbo II' into a 
cocked baseball cap.. However, Centek have a couple of aces of their 
own up their capacious sleeves.. Their 50 mhz '030 (with DSP overclock 
and fastRAM) is available right NOW! Also compatibility with non-GEM 
Falcon software is better than any '040 based accelerator can manage.. 
Not totally perfect, but more than good enough if you have a spare 
Falcon, which I do (Oops, got to stop reminding people of that!) It 
also seems that Centurbo II may well be supported by parts of the 
'Scene', so whether that leads to demos and games either written 
specially for it, or otherwise enhanced to make use of the extra 
processing horsepower, remains to be seen.. But the signs are hopeful..

This time around, I'm taking no chances, I'm getting whichever one I'm 
choosing fitted for me.. Self-fit bodge DIY upgrades suck, professional 
fitting rules!

Dave says.. "And don't forget the Eclipse PCI graphics card adaptor!"


CIH Virus - A 'Toast' in the machine!

I received an email from someone who shall remain somewhat fatherly in 
nature, and definitely very senior! It went something like this..

Have you seen the news on Digitiser?!?!? Something 
about a "CIH virus"!! It was on 4/8/98... You wouldn't
have anything to do with this would you?!?!?! ;) 
Anyway, here's some info I got from Dejanews-
apparently BT has accidentely infected computer 
with it over their Wireplayer service!!!

Old Fart!!

===

(Er, no. - Ed)

Well, British Telecom Wireplay has managed to do it quite effectively.
Basically they uploaded an infected copy of their software to their
site - it automatically updated older versions and passed on the CIH
virus with it.

CIH overwrites BIOS information and the hard drive - it means an
infected and damaged computer requires a new motherboard or BIOS chip.
It's one of the most serious and damaging viruses there is.

The full story is at http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/1998/30/ns-5142.html
Suffice to say BT was using an old version of Dr Solomons before
detection for CIH was added. They neglected to use the extra.drv file
available from version 7.85 - unforgivable as the file has been around
for at least a few weeks and has been advertised by Dr Solomons for 
free download from the Dr Solomons website.The infection took place on 
Monday *and* Tuesday of this week. They now claim to have learnt how to
use the anti-virus software.

However, they aren't providing infected users with the means to remove
the virus (which triggers on 26 August.) Merely providing an uninfected
patch of Wireplay software!  They have no legal liability for their
ineptitude - a simple failure to use updated versions of anti-virus
software responsibly.

Okay, are we all clear on this? Atari good..  Wintel PC, you get f*cked

Celine Dion - My Snot will go on!

A fascinating fact about our favourite Canadian chanteuse was revealed 
in a recent interview..

No, not the fact that she is scarily coming to resemble Bryan 'tedious' 
Adams ever more, day by day, nor even the fact that she is due to 
'retire' from making music to drown to (Titanic, et al)..

It is the fact that she avoids eating dairy products as they apparently 
cause her too much mucus!

Errm, a little too much information given there, perhaps?!

 
Apple go to the 'Sony' side of the street!

Apple, of Macintosh fame have taken a break from the very hard labour 
of thinking up new colour schemes for the iMac case ("Any colour you 
like, as long as it is semi-transparent!") and have come up with a 
brilliant short cut for boosting the Mac's game appeal, generally 
lacking to the Wintel 'warez' crowd, with a few honourable exceptions..

Very simply, Apple have decided to promote a software emulator of the 
best-selling Playstation games console, as a semi-commercial enterprise 
at about thirty quid (UKP) a time.. The system was shown on the G3 Mac, 
and is claimed to run about two hundred games so far.. One Apple 
executive was moved so far as to describe this as "Ten times cool!"

There is a rather large Sony-shaped problem in the offing, as Sony are 
almost certainly not going to approve of such liberties being taken 
with their hardware.. Apple's flimsy reasoning that "Sony won't mind 
because they sell the hardware at cost, and make the money on the 
software!" will no doubt be blasted away when Sony come up with a 
suitably amusing adaption of the words "Court" and "See you in"!!  


Coders are very different from Normal People - Episode 972..

We all know what paranoid-obsessive types all the coders are.. Now 
casting your mind back to 16th Century Russia makes you think that Tsar 
Ivan the Terrible missed out on the availability of cheap home 
computers by a period of several hundred years, if you consider the 
following..

When he had St Basils cathedral built in Moscow, he blinded the 
architects, so they could not create another like it.. Clearly an 
internet-sized ego in operation there!

On the other hand, if he was really a true proto-coder, a weirdy-beardy 
despotic Mr Pink of the 16th century, then he would have had St Basils 
built deep underground, where no-one else could see it!! 

Maybe this analogy sort of falls apart the closer you get to it, but 
I'm sure you get the general idea?


Here, Kitty Kitty?

Red Dwarf Series VIII News!

Red Dwarf, the eighth series, starts showing on BBC2 from the 18th 
February (Thursday) at 9.00pm, repeated on Sundays..

One moment please..

YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!

More details of this momentous event are contained in the press 
release, which can be checked out below.. (Culled from the official 
website):-

Press release for Red Dwarf Series VIII: The eighth series of the 
International Emmy and British Comedy Award winning series returns to 
our screens (UK.) on Thursday 18th February 1999 at 9.00pm and repeated 
on the Sunday. Series VII having been the highest rated show on BBC 2 
in 1997.

The first episode entitled 'Back In The Red - Part 1' kicks off the new 
series in style. The nanobots have not only recreated Red Dwarf they 
have also populated the ship with its old crew. This is extremely good 
news for Rimmer (Chris Barrie). 'Back In The Red' also sees the return 
of Holly (Norman Lovett) as the ships original computer and Mac 
McDonald as Captain Hollister together with crew members Chen (Paul 
Bradley) and Selby (David Gillespie).

Now, for the first time we can give you all the episode titles in their 
broadcast order:-

      Episode 1: Back In The Red - Part 1
      Episode 2: Back In The Red - Part 2
      Episode 3: Back In The Red - Part 3
      Episode 4: Cassandra
      Episode 5: Krytie TV
      Episode 6: Pete - Part 1
      Episode 7: Pete - Part 2
      Episode 8: Only The Good ...


      The main cast are: Chris Barrie as Rimmer. Craig Charles as 
Lister, Danny John-Jules as Cat, Robert Llewellyn as Kryten and Chloe 
Annett as Kochanski. Plus special guests including: Geraldine McEwan, 
Graham McTavish and Jake Wood.

      Series VIII features the Skutters in superb and controlled 
working order. This is progress indeed as the Skutters were last seen 
in earlier series, when owing to a slight technical hitch, they used to 
pick up mini-cab radio transmissions near the studios which resulted in 
them randomly attacking the cast without warning, much to the delight 
of the studio audience. 

     Highlights include Danny John-Jules as the Cat engaging in a 
stunning dance sequence with the spacecraft Blue Midget and the entire 
crew become horribly embroiled with a gigantic dinosaur.

      Six of the episodes have been written solely by Creator and 
Executive Producer Doug Naylor and the other two co-written by Doug 
Naylor and Paul Alexander. The new series is skilfully piloted by Ed 
Bye who returns as Director Producer.

      BBC-TWO's longest running and highest rating situation comedy has 
spawned a huge worldwide cult following, it is currently the most 
popular British show in America and is also airing in Japan where NHK - 
Japan's equivalent of BBC 1 is showing all 52 episodes of Red Dwarf 
including those which have been remastered.

      The first of a series of Red Dwarf movies featuring all the 
regular cast is scheduled to begin shooting in the Spring of the year 
2000..


Got that folks!


So what did you *Think* it was going to be used for?!?

Take this as a case of extreme naivety not seen to such an extent since 
the noted 19th Century Swedish inventor, and famed prize-giver, Alfred 
Noble said "I hope that these funny looking blasting sticks that I just 
invented are only going to be used for peaceful purposes?" 

Bringing things firmly into the present, someone came up with a 
brilliant idea for an emulator, the Nintendo 64 console (N64), and not 
just one which only sort of works, but an emulator fully capable of 
running N64 games, in the form of ROM images of the cartridges! (This 
one is for PC only, don't get excited, all you Atari computer users..)

No-one would be surprised by the explosive growth in interest in N64 
piracy.. You might think the author might have had a bit of a clue what 
was going on when begging requests for N64 ROM images 'to try out' on 
the emulator deluged the airwaves?

But no! The author is shocked by the abuse of the emulator, which was 
only meant to be a 'technical exercise', unhappy that Nintendo was 
being 'hurt' by the release of this emulator, and pulls it off the net, 
after it had only been available for a few hours!

(Whatever next, R. Oppenheimer shocked and stunned by large hole in 
New Mexico desert left by his first attempt at practical atomic energy, 
unpleasantness at Hiroshima avoided by withdrawal of nuclear device? If 
only it were that simple!)

Still, ten out of ten for technical brilliance, but nought out of ten 
for not being able to work out what his brilliance was really going to 
be used for!


Bye bye, Miss Monopoly Pie?

To end this edition of Dirk on a heartening note, remember the US 
Supreme Court anti-trust case against Microsoft?

Well, in anticipation of victory against Microsoft, US Government 
agencies are actively looking at curbing Microsoft's power and 
influence in the future, by either making 'Windows' an open standard, 
or even taking the step of splitting up the company!

*CiH is nice to Microsoft shock!* (Or is he??)

Now personally, I would like to see the less extreme option taken, that 
is, to allow access to Windows as an open standard, to allow 'clone' 
makers the chance to make a better version of it, which would hopefully 
make the O/S market on PCs genuinely competitive.. This would then 
force Microsoft to raise its game, having to produce an efficient and 
reliable O/S.. Otherwise, it might prove to be the case, that Microsoft 
are institutionally incapable of improving themselves, so a slow(ish) 
decline and painful death would follow.. 

And I think this would hurt a *lot* more than splitting up the company!

Good night!

 CiH - Various in '98 and '99
