ˆSupercomputers: A Brief History

In the meterogical office in Bracknell (UK) lives a Cray T3e MPP 
the 3rd most powerful computer in the world, sporting a rather 
sexy total of 840 processors capable of whacking out millions of 
calculations per second. A system like this costs 1.2 million 
pounds (and that's a lotta zeros, ker-ching!). What is all this 
raw computing power used for? (Dramatic pause) The weather, the 
sodding weather..... and not for playing Quake :(

"So how does it work?" I hear you mutter ecstatically, well I 
shall explain (whether you like it or not). Imagine the globe is 
split up into small areas, thousands of them (zulus?) each having 
data on pressure, tempurature, wind speed, and all the other 
things weather persons go on about (Does anyone actually 
understand the satellite photos?) The more sections, the more 
accurate, and slower the simulation will run (Think of it as a 
very souped up version of that old chessnut 'The Game of Life'. 

So theoretically the more proccessors you slap in (parallel 
style) the faster the simulation will run, as each processor 
performs calculations on only a few sections. That is the beauty 
of parallel processing, but we will return to that later.

Meanwhile let us grab the wheel, stick some classic tunes on the 
stereo, and take a drive down the highway that is supercomputer 
history.

So what is a supercomputer? Well "The Computer Technology 
Dictionary" from Acedemic Press describes a sumpercomputer as 
'any  computer that is one of the largest, fastest and most 
powerful available at any given time'. A nice conclusive 
definition I believe ..... Hmmm.

The first supercomputer was the IBM 704 which first waddled onto 
the scene way back in 1955 (yep they did have computers, and no 
they were not powered by coal) capable of 5,000 floating point 
operations per second (Flops). It sounds hard to believe, but by 
todays standards, it's pitiful. Then in 1962 the UK started 
production of its own supercomputer (Hurrah) capable of 
delivering 200,000 Flops (As you can see the Intel revolution did 
not invent the concept of operation speeds increasing in leaps 
and bounds).

It is interesting (to some) to note that this was the first 
system to utilise virtual memory and pipelines.

Multitasking was unheard of until 1967 when Gene Amdahl put 
forward the theory of parallel processing but it was not until 
1979 that the first parallel computer was built by ICL called DPA 
(Distributed Processor Array) and had begun life on the drawing 
board five years earlier. 

1988. It is at this point that the PC revolution came into full 
swing, so we will ignore most things Microsoft and Intel related. 

Let's fast forward >>

In 1992, a four processor system from NEC was produced and was 
the first computer to execute at a speed of 20,000 million Flops. 

Within the next four years the world saw the first system capable 
of achieving one Tera Flop. The Intel (Boo) ASCI Red 
supercomputer has continued to be developed, and now uses 9,152 
Pentium Pro processors with a theoretical maximum speed of 1.8 
Tera Flops.

What has this to do with STs? What has this to do with a DIY 
supercomputer? What has this to do with me? I hear you mumble 
despondently. Well ...erm... to tell you the truth absolutely 
nothing but it is good to have a little knowledge of 
supercomputer history in case you are ever asked :) 

The DIY Supercomputer
---------------------
What is widley regarded as the first DIY supercomputer was 
created in the hallowed halls of MIT (clever dick central 
...erm... what exactly is a clever dick) and was named Beowulf 
after the liturary masterpiece (Beowulf would go on to become the 
generic term for this type of machine)

The first Beowulf was completed in 1995 and consisted of 16 
medium spec. 486DX/4's using ethernet cards (two of them) to 
provide interprocessor communication. With each individual system 
running a copy of everyone's second favourate freeware OS, Linux. 
This allowed the communication to take the form of standard linux 
ethernet calls. This system was then used to perform an N-body 
gravitational simulation.
 
The simulation was used to calculate the gravitational changes of 
a star forming an interstellar cloud, and then later to calculate 
the fragmentation of the Shoemaker Levy comet.

waiting for

WARNING: TECHNICAL BIT

A Beowulf setup consists of a controlling machine and a set of 
router and data nodes. The controlling machine is the only one 
that will appear as an external network and is used to initiate 
the parallel processing. The communication is via Ethernet 
connections. Each router node is responsible for distributing the 
parallel application to the data nodes, initialising the start 
conditions and then passing data back and forth along the network 
links.

Using modern Atari Software and hardware such as the Falcon or TT 
with their LAN sockets, and software such as Linux 68000 a system 
not dissimilar to the Beowulf (above) could be theoretically 
constructed. The question is of course....would you want too :)
