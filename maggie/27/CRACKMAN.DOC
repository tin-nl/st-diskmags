As the end of the century  approaches,  the popularity of one of video
games' first  stars  shows  no  sign  of  diminishing.  Yes,  the pill
popping, ghost gobbling, yellow sphere is back on the atari. Again.

Whilst Mario Becroft's  "Pacman  For  Gem"  appealed  to  the Windows-
Solataire class of  gamers,  Crackman  attacks  the hardware directly.
Like Pacman On E's, it  is  STe  only.  Happily  it  also works on the
Falcon without any backwards style hassles.

Crackman also shares  "Pacman  On  E's"  drug  connotations,  with the
narcotic of choice  for  our  hero  being  crack  cocaine.  The comedy
storyline is  obviously  the  result  of  too  many  late  night  bong
sessions. These Dutch are crazy!

The game is created by a  new  crew called 'Teenage'. It's really cool
that there are fresh atari  groups  setting  up;  as some of the older
crews retire, its great to see new blood racing to take their place.

Crackman is coded entirely in  assembly  -  this bodes well for future
TNH productions. A  whole  host  of  STe  features  are used including
hardware scrolling and sampled sound.  There  is  even support for the
Jaguar Powerpads.

The front end  features  a  starfield  and  some  'morphing text'. The
options are limited in the beta release to 'Play','Info' and 'Quit'.

The info screens highlight some healthy rivalry between teenage and UK
based ST games developer Kev Callahan.  Competition is always good for
pushing people into creating the best they can.

On starting the game, the first thing that strikes you is the hardware
scrolling - it is silky smooth.  You  immediately know that this is an
STe specific production.

Pedants beware! Whilst  the  game  looks  like  Pacman  and plays like
Pacman, it soon becomes  evident  that  it  isn't Pacman. For starters
there is no enclosure for the ghosts  to generate in. Gone too are the
PowerPills - the bonuses that gave you the power of ghost eating.

But this is not a cut  down  version  of the classic, extras have been
included and are well worth a nibble.

 * Speed Pills - allow you to outrun the fiendish enemies
 * Bonus Pills - Crackman loves to 'score', and these give him lots of
                 points
 * Extra Lives - Another Crackman to play with
 * Bullets     - Crackman likes 'blow', and with these you can blow
                 the ghost away
 * Mine        - It's like playing Supercars 2!

The second thing you notice about this game is that it is 'rock' hard!
( That's terrible! More  please!  -ED  )  Even  with  one ghost on the
level, pill eating is no  picnic  for  Crackman.  Unlike the ghosts in
PacMan which mainly wandered aimlessly around the maze and occasionaly
decided to meander over to you and  shake you by the teeth, Crackman's
ghosts have a one track mind.  They  spend their entire life trying to
devour you. They react to your  every  move and are continually trying
to home into you.

As you can imagine, this makes  life extremely difficult. As there are
no powerpills to eat, it is hard to turn the tables on the ghosts. And
once you get to levels with  more  than one ghost it becomes virtually
impossible - one ghost may  be  approaching  from  above and the other
from below. Either way, you're toast.

Controlling Crackman is also quite awkward  -  it is very difficult to
make him corner. As you spend nearly  the entire game with a ghost hot
on your tail it is essential  that  you can quickly negotiate your way
around the maze. Bad  cornering  is  a  problem  with  a lot of Pacman
games, something that Ed Cleveland  solved  with a clever algorithm in
his Super PacMan game  (free  with  Maggie  25).  I would suggest that
Pheno looks at implementing this algorithm  as  it  would add a lot of
playability to the game.

There are some nice touches to  CrackMan  -  the bullets and mines are
good features  which  spice  up  the  genre.  There  are  also  hidden
entrances in some walls and the  ghosts  are  not smart enough to find
them, but again you need good cornering to get through them.

I do feel that  the  game's  difficulty  level  would  put all but the
hardened gamers off. There  is  nothing  clever about writing 'clever'
artificial intelligence. The best AI routines  are a mixture of clever
and stupid with a deal of  unpredictability  mixed in. In CrackMan you
can move left then right and the  ghost will exactly mimic your moves.
The beauty of PacMan was that there  was  a good range of AI, from the
really dumb ghosts  up  to  the  fiendish  ones.  A  player could ease
himself into the game and  work  out  different strategies against the
different enemies, whilst in Crackman  you  are  thrown in at the deep
end. All the ghost are bastard hard.

Whilst some gamers will thrive on  this sort of challenge, others will
pac in the pill and  resign  themselves to more sedate implementations
of the genre.

Teenage have also released  their  level  editor  for Crackman. In the
great tradition of level editors  this  allows  you to, erm, edit your
own levels. This should add some longevity to the game and Teenage are
promising us levels  created  by  some  atari  scene  celebrities. The
editor itself is very easy (unliked me!  -Hard  ED) to use so when you
become bored by the standard levels you can take matters into your own
hands.

As is another great tradition with atari games (c.f. Republic, Willies
etc.) this game has been in  development  for some time now and should
really have been finished. To  be  fair  to  TNH,  this is their first
project and they are still learning,  and  it  is to their credit that
this looks so much better than many crews first games.

Some people have complained about the  lack of real PowerPills and the
ability to eat ghosts, but I think  this  is missing the point. If you
want a totally faithful PacMan conversion  then look elsewhere - there
are plenty of clones about.  If  you  want  something a bit different,
with a bit of STe sparkle and are willing to brave the fiercest ghosts
in atari history, then crackman is for you.
