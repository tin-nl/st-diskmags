Ö             ç..{} The Unreal World of Fake Demos {}..

As an inevitable by-product of the real thing, the supply of Atari fake 
demos remains a dripping tap of fun or fecklessness, depending on your 
point of view.. Some of the following may well make you want to laugh 
out loud, some of them make you want to leave your lunch on the 
pavement instead!

 
 Ipir 'Rump Mapper' demo..

Okay, what can we say, really scraping the barrel of enthusiasm here, 
with a demo that linked the recently popular 'bump-mapping' effect with 
the witless pun 'rump'.. Oh dear....

Kicking it into life, and a certain charm pastes itself across the 
screen, the pleasingly childish visuals are perfectly complemented by 
the nursery rhyme music.. That is, if you are prepared to accept a 
nursery rhyme written and performed by a recently defrocked Swedish 
priest going around under the stage name of "Dr Demented"!

(What he was defrocked for need not concern you, dear reader..)

The demo builds up to its 'climax', a drunken trouser-dropper caught in 
the act and lit up by a pseudo lighting effect, the 'rump-map' in 
question!

A kind of torus soon follows, and various greetings, which are best 
hastily passed over to finish..

This faketro manages to blend in its various audio and visual elements 
as cleverly as its more serious brothers.. Very funny from the first, 
and a rare joke demo that manages to rise above the 'one joke funny for 
one time only' label that clings shroudlike to so many of its 
brethren.. 

 70% - It kicks rump!


 Da Boosters 'Spacebot'..

Yet another production that might well describe itself as 'not rocket 
science'.. The name 'Spacebot' induces a profound fear of yet more 
anally inspired faketro antics, but you are not to worry..

What you do get, is a hilarious parody of the Beachie Boys summer hit 
'Intergalac-sick'.. A reasonably faithful recreation of the video and 
song, subject to the processing limits, graphical and sound power of 
the Faclon '30.. This includes extra hardware never seen in the 
standard Falcon, such as 'tone-flatteners' to stop the music 
overwhelming the majority of cheap hi-fi equipment.. These particular 
variants of the basic Falcon are very rare, with the single export 
batch ending up in an ice-floe somewhere in Greenland! 

There are cunningly scrolling fore and aft bits as well as the main 
attraction.. Unfortunately, the Beachie Boys tribute band involved in 
the making of this faketro, were all squashed flat by a cartoon robot..

 65% - Not the top of the class, but not the 'spacebot' either!


 (The) Nun Demo..

I have a whole bag of puns ready for this demo, how about 'Nun but the 
brave' would attempt this kind of subject matter, or a 'Nunplussed' 
demo censor tries to get to grips with shocktro!

Moving on to 'Nun to five', as fake demo makers reveal it was all 
created in office hours..

Not forgetting their possible planned release for the year before the 
millenium in 'Nun-teen Nun-ety Nine'!

Fake demo? - Very well then, fake review!

Alright, it's rude, very rude, and blurry, the sort of effect that you 
might see if you persist in certain forms of self-abuse for too long, 
or so those stiff-looking Victorian era self-help manuals once said!

 60% - It's over far too quickly! (MSG, what're you doing in this          
         review?)


 A Small Brainless Gag..

A quick (written less in 1 hour) anti-PC 'tribute' demo, modelled on 
the famous 'Things not to do' cartoon demo, but only one scene of the 
hapless owner putting his Wintel box of joy in the dustbin.. All over 
so quickly..

Anyone fancy doing a full 'Things not to do' style jokefest, with loads 
of different horrible but hilarious things happening to those expensive 
Window boxes.. How about it?

 50% - So short, but so sweet!
ç

          çSpecial seasonally afflicted Xmas demo supplement!

And this was a time of year just gone where presents were exchanged, 
family members visit, and occasionally, fight one another, too much 
food eaten. and the oh so inevitable cheap and cheerful quick Xmas demo 
releases follow..

 Paranoia X-Mass Demo..

Having a whole 24 hours to spare on this demo soon reaps rewards, 
firstly in the shape of a tasteful 'Millenium bug' joke where the use-
by dates on a carton of milk, a tin of cola ('Pupsi' - The cola drink 
for dogs?) and a typical 'entry-level PC of today are all displayed.. 
The PC's 'use-by' date is, of course, the 1st of January 2000!

Personally, I think it's unfair on the carton of milk to compare a PC 
with it, as every fool know that we're really looking at something like 
a  snowflake in July to accurately measure the life span of a PC 
against!

The second part of this little demo is a more routine Xmas scene, with 
a bit of a twist with a gift-wrapped razor blade, surely not being sent 
to Moondog? A greets text, and burbly YM-generated 'traditional' Xmas 
type music..

Oh, and close the door behind you, when you reset your computer..

 60% - 'Yule' be sorry for not getting this one! (doohh!)


 Mary Xmas from da Boosters..

Animated Xmas card type of thing, a bit like a 'Nun' production, but 
without access to fancy Dan state-of-the-art graphics hardware, sort of 
homely scribble, like the Senior Dads (whatever happened to them, now 
that was a Fake Crew with aspirations..)

Then all over..

 50% - Brandy Butter..


 SnowStorm / Reservoir Gods..

This effort is easily the most ambitious of the '98 crop of Xmas demos, 
that is to say, not very..

However, we are grateful even for small mercies. and clicking off with 
a smart Res Gods logo and a kicking MSG soundtrack which only slowly 
turns into something 'naughty and nice' along a more 'Xmassy' theme..

The main effect is showcased, a smooth 3-D 'snowfield' (as in 
starfield, but blobbier) with various effects going into the camera 
view, including such anti-social deviancy as end on end tumbling.. (Mr 
Pink also says that there are more snowflakes on an RGB monitor, over a 
VGA one!) At the same time, there is an extended greets, session 
scrolling away at the bottom of the screen.. So it is a plan to save 
money on sending out Xmas cards then!

There are various Xmas cards from MSG's table which paint themselves 
onscreen in an exhibitionist fashion.. These have been scanned in, 
including one I seem to remember sending myself..

Then it goes around again..

 72% - Play your Xmas cards right to get greeted here?
 

Anyone want to know my 1999 wish? No, not the call-girls and cold 
custard one, people aren't supposed to know about that, not with me 
going out with someone and all... Ahem!!

Please, more ambitious fake demos.. I'm not going to go all 'Moondog' 
on fake crews and slag them out of hand, but some of the recent efforts 
are just a tad on the short  side? There is only so much interest you 
can summon up for a single screen with an average joke..

Good luck for '99 though..
