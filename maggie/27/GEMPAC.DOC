This is what he did before 
Mouse Burster (see also 
review in this issue!) This 
interestingly GEM-friendly 
version of the old arcade 
standard, Pacman, is far from 
complete, but is pretty good, 
even at this early stage.. As 
I'll explain, it might not be 
the best thing ever on a bog-
standard ST, but for Falcons, 
boosted ST's, and higher end 
clones, especially those 
lacking games, this may be 
worth a closer look..

 Just how GEM-Compatible?
This covers a wide range of 
GEM-ness, but not quite 
everything..

ST low and medium modes are 
definitely out, unless you 
like playing with the bottom 
half of the screen missing! 
'Blind Pacman' is a little 
known and very unpopular 
member of the genre, and was 
put in the stupid ideas 
trashcan, along with other 
such notables as 'Space 
Invaders in the dark'..

Things pick up with ST mono, 
the 640 x 400 screen mode is 
up to the job.. Colour adds 
itself with Falcon screen 
modes, nicer looking in VGA.. 
It is happy running under 
MagiC under multi-tasking, 
and looks positively polished 
on a higher colour and higher 
resolution spec screen..

 Just how Pacman-Compatible?
This goes along the lines of most recent interpretations of the game, 
that is, offering the basic range of ghosts and power-pills, with the 
odd pick-up fruity bonus, but set in several teasingly different 
game-maps.. Some help from Spion of Escape, and other people was 
brought in here, with the names of some of the levels, such as 'DHS 
chase you!' clearly having a major 'scene' influence..

The graphics are mainly functional, but well-drawn.. A too elaborate 
design (256 or truecolour) would be out of the question as this game 
has to adapt to a potentially very wide range of screen modes, some 
with a limited colour palette to choose from.. There aren't any rough 
edges, even is this is an early version, and a lot of thought has 
been clearly given to make it look as attractive, within the 
constraints of a GEM environment, as possible..

There are a handy gobful of options, selectable from the menus at the 
top of the screen.. Speed of game, according to whether you want your 
Pacman experience pensioner Sunday-outing slow, or so fast it's all 
over in three seconds! There is also support for DMA sound, with some 
suitable sampled sounds for STe/TT machines and above.. This can be 
turned off, if you are apathetic, or lacking the appropriate 
hardware..

There are some other options which seem to be pencilled in for future 
updates, such as the ability to load in new graphics and level data, 
neither of which to hand as yet..

Game control is down to the keyboard, and the key cursors in 
particular.. The assumption is, that serious GEM-legal types don't 
normally have jagpads hanging around too close to their computers, 
and this games playing thing is a bit of a strange beast really..


 Just how Brain-Compatible? It starts easy-ish, with just the one 
angry ghost chasing you around the levels.. The intelligence seems to 
be quite good, but there are reasonable amounts of power-pills 
scattered around the level, some of which needing some nifty finger-
work with the cursor keys to get to in time! The 'teleport gates' to 
travel from one side of the other to dodge the ghosts often come in 
useful, although the little bleeders do occasionally follow you 
through - ouch!

It has some nice genteel touches, as it is possible to pause in mid-
game, or quit any time if a humiliatingly low score isn't your bag 
after all, or if the boss comes in and catches you playing games when 
you should be working.. On an Atari?? Did I really say that?!

I don't know how soon, if at all, when any further versions of this 
game are due to be released, but on the evidence shown so far, this 
is well worth keeping a closer eye on..
