Megaplayer v1.15

(Falcon '030 only)

This useful music player has  not  really  received a lot of attention 
from us before for a number of reasons which I'll try to explain 
shortly.. It was created as a play-only extension to the Mega Tracker 
composer  program.. Both of these seemed to go through a development 
process typical of the French Atari scene, that is that  no-one  was  
really  sure  whether  there  was still any development process going 
on or not until it was too late!

Both Mega Tracker and Mega Player  were  shareware, and in both cases, 
it looked like the shareware  registrations  were defunct and that the 
author, Simplet of Fatal Design, had  totally  jumped ship and possibly 
moved to South America at the same  time.. Shame really, as initial 
versions of  Mega  Tracker  gave  me   my   first  taste  of  (mostly)  
working Screamtracker multichannel modfiles, and  Mega  Player was a 
promising GEM-friendly interpretation of  the  theme,  and  potentially 
the most capable Atari desktop modfile player there was..

As it happened, the full  registered  version  of  the Mega Player was 
released as freeware earlier this year, albeit without any new work on 
it, since the last updates  in  '95-96..  Still, we gratefully receive 
what small mercies there are, and this is now the place where we come 
in to review it..

Mega Player can  be  run  as  a  .PRG  program  within a multi-tasking 
environment, or as an .ACC  from  a  single-tasking TOS desktop.. Mega 
Player has the now universal Audio  CD player style interface, adapted 
for the GEM desktop,  which  can  take  on  a  more  '3D' look on more 
advanced desktops.. Modfiles are loaded  through the file selector and 
start playing immediately..

You don't have to look  too  far  for  other  options,  as well as the 
standard 'pause/stop/fast-forward' type controls on the front panel, a 
little judicious clicking around produces a menu to control the volume 
and sound quality, as you can select any of the normal replay rates of 
the Falcon Audio, from the 'default' or  maximum 50 kHz, right down to 
the lower replay rates possible on the Falcon sound chip.. This is 
potentially  useful  for  giving some CPU time back to the Falcon if 
you are  running Mega Player in combination with another desktop or Gem 
application..

There is  a  'playlist'  option,  where  you  can  pre-select  several 
modfiles to be played, and  in  a  particular  order to be played too, 
Mega Player acting as a  digital  jukebox,  so  you don't have to keep 
breaking off from the task in hand to re-select another tune..

There are some 'cosmetic'  touches  too,  with both spectrum analyzers 
and and oscilloscope which  can  be  put  on  screen  in their own gem 
windows.. This form of window dressing  is standard to practically all 
desktop modfile players  produced  after  the  spartan  'Rape the DSP' 
player..

In terms of  what  it  can  handle,  Mega  Player  walks  all over the 
opposition, certainly in the world of desktop players, and even giving 
most full tracker/composer programs a formidable challenge..

Mega Player handles  standard  four-channel  Protracker style modfiles 
easily enough, it also can deal with various 8-channel formats such as 
early Fast Tracker and Octalyser tunes.. After that, it replays Scream 
Tracker multi-channel tunes  more  or  less  correctly, certainly good 
enough for 95% of the time,  and  even  has  a courageous stab at more 
recent formats such as the 32  channel  .XM format, of which, only one 
other tracker is able  to  replay  on  the  Falcon  to any extent! (An 
interesting side issue is that  certain  .XM  tunes  seem to be former 
Protracker modfiles converted to .XM  headers,  according to the  Mega 
Player information dialogue!

There are other  multi-channel  formats  it  will  play, including one 
unique to Mega Player, the .MGT  format,  which is apparently the most 
efficient CPU-wise for this player..  One rarity which probably hasn't 
been implemented on ANY other  Atari  based tracker or modfile player, 
is the ability to play  Protracker  four channel modfiles with panning 
commands, a very rarely  encountered  effect  in  the normal course of 
things, I just happen to have one such modfile that does that!

The hard work  is  done  via  a  combination  of  CPU  and  DSP, and a 
'Nemesis' or Centurbo type  accelerator  is  useful  in providing that 
little extra 'poke' for the  bigger  modfiles..  Replay on some of the 
more esoteric formats is pretty  good,  only  really beaten by Grauomf 
Tracker.. However,  Mega  Player  is  easily  accessible  from  a  GEM 
environment..

In general use, Mega Tracker seems to be pretty reliable.. Personally, 
I tend to be careful with it around, as my Falcon has suffered the odd 
inexplicable 'stoppage' in mid-play.. This is  more than likely due to 
an aging computer with an early  series DSP which sometimes decides to 
please itself whether it wants to  work properly or not.. Accelerating 
via Nemesis at higher clock speeds  is  more likely to put some strain 
on the hardware as well.. The  other   question  mark is with MagiC, a 
lovely  O/S,  but  not  exactly   a  by-word  for  universal  software 
compatibility.. I've got a  feeling  that  Mega  Tracker OUGHT to work 
under MagiC, but whether it DOES  work  under MagiC seems to depend on 
the  individual users configuration, and  I'm  just one of the unlucky 
ones!

In conclusion, Mega Tracker is a  big  hit  on this desktop, and as it 
has been re-released as freeware, an absolute bargain!

Not sure if MagiC compatible, can anyone else enlighten us?
