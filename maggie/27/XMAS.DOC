Christmas doesn't really  begin  for  us  Atari  kids  until the first
Christmas demo springs forth  into  our  disk  drives. Expectations of
such demos are low -  they  are  the  coding equivalent of the novelty
Christmas record.

                   = How To Make A Christmas Demo =
                         = with Delia Smith =

This Recipe Requires:

    1 Old Logo
    Some Christmas Cards
    A Large Vat Of Mulled Wine
    "Christmas Hits '96" Mix Tape
    An old starfield effect

First force your musician to  listen  to  the Christmas Mix tape until
brainwashed. The tape should contain 3 or more of the following tunes:

  "Rocking Around The Christmas Tree"
  "Mistletoe & Wine"
  Those Teletubbies and Mr Blobby records (extended mix)
  Anything by Slade

Leave musician in corner with tracker program. Allow to ferment.

Take one ordinary demo group logo. Sprinkle liberally with snow.
Throw into the demo.

Place your Christmas cards face  down  on  a  flat bed scanner. Ensure
they have been thoroughly replicated before removing.

Feverishly adapt any starfield like  effect  you  have lying around so
that it could possibly resemble some sort of snow effect.

Throw everything together. Serve Immediately.

We all know what  to  expect  from  a  Christmas  demo.  It  is like a
Christmas Present whose ill-fitting wrapping paper gives it away.

This is Paranoia's  first  foray  into  the  cutthroat  Christmas Demo
market. A quick attempt to digest the  doc file causes one word to get
stuck in the gullet. "STOS".

I know that this language has  its  advocates, fanatics who would burn
at the stake any blasphemers  who  dared  utter one word of criticism.
But  to  my  mind  the  words  "STOS"  and  "demo"  go  together  like
"Microsoft" and "Reliability".  Sure,  I  may  be  prejudiced, but I'm
still waiting to be proved wrong.

Being a STOS production, this program  is  only  happy to start from a
nice sensible ST resolution. Thankfully  it  does  run happily on both
STs and Falcons without having to resort to the dreaded Backwards.

The demo begins with a series of  16 colour pictures which form a joke
on the sell by date of 300Mhz  PCs.  Actually I think they will be out
of date long before 2000, but then  I've  seen all the new Intel chips
which I can't possibly tell anyone about.

Back to the demo, and the main effect now appears.

A snow covered Paranoia Logo  (and  razor  blade)  stand in front of a
flurry of snow. Some text is printed on the screen in that lovely STOS
font and here we can read  greetings  but no Christmas jokes! (Perhaps
this is a good thing).

The snow effect is just  some  vertically  moving  dots, but I suspect
Paranoid may have coded this bit in assembly - his first steps in 68k.
There is a silly bug which means that some 'snowflakes' aren't cleared
as they descend the screen. But as its Christmas we will forgive him.

Blipping away merrily in the background is a jaunty christmas tune.

Considering all this was put together  in  just  24 hours, its quite a
respectable achievement.


Christmas demos exist in a sort of no mans land between fake demos and
intros. No one expects  them  to  be  technically impressive, they are
just there to give you a bit of warmth and joy on the cold days before
Christmas.

The Paranoia demo does this perfectly.  This  demo  put a smile on our
faces and helped us to get into the christmas spirit.
