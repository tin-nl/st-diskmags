Tracking music is not only a feeling,  it is also a way of expression,
that requires intelligence and "know how".  If  you just got home from
school/work and decides to  track  for  a  few  minutes to create your
contribution for the next music competition you will most probably end
up at the bottom section of the competition.

Creating good  trackermusic  requires  patience,  planning,  technical
skills and most of all that  you  are  in  a good trackermood when you
start to develop your song.

Step one: Determine your current status/mood.

Before you can change/enhance your  current  status/mood you will have
to decide what your current trend is.

1. Have you a idea of what you want your new track to sound like ?

Be specific just dont say: Well i  want  it  to sound good and be very
slow! Rather say:I want  to  create  something  with fresh instruments
using an slow intro with reverberated violins and distorted low volume
drums in the background. And then build from that.

2. Prepare samples the week/day before.

Make sure you dont have to spend the entire evening with loading other
modules to get some  samples.  Arrange  the  samples  into easy to use
categories. Divide  your drums  into  different  sections aswell like:
breakbeat 80-120 bpm  and  then  a  sub  directory  with    flangered/
distorted versions  of the same set of samples.

3. Rest your ears as much as possible the day before.

You will need full concentration to spot errors in your finetuning and
slightly misstimed delayed notes.

4. Remove all distractions.

Warn your  parents/girlfriend/boyfriend in time   so  you dont have to
spend any time chasing them out of  the  room (in my  case i only have
one litte room so i usually make sure that no little girls are left in
the premises). Look under the bed :-)

5. Proper nutrition.

This is one of the most important parts in creating something that you
can be proud of. I  have  created  some food/supplements programs that
you can follow to get more  energy  to  your  sessions in front of the
tracker.

You can loose way to much time if  you  need to go downtown for a late
hour burger  and  besides  you  need  real  food  to  endure  the long
sessions.


Getting started
---------------

This is how a good day of serious tracking can be like.

The pre settings are as follows:

- You have had a day off from work/school.
- You have spared your ears from loud music.
- Samples has been arranged long time before.
- Parents/girlfriend/boyfriend are away.

09.00 Goodmorning! The alarm clock had been  set to this early hour to
give you time to refuel your energy reserves after the night (you burn
a lot of calories at night and loose a lot of fluid).

Take a long shower/bath to loose your  limbs  up and spend the time to
reset your mind from the dreams/thoughts you might have had during the
night.

(note:eh..well the above is for the really serious/weird trackers:-)

Warm up your equipment. I  prefer  starting  my  session using more or
less disco equipment not so  much  designed for finding false pitches,
notes.

Later on when you are searching/refining  your  tune i suggest you use
some  high  quality  headphones   with  treble/midrange/bass  controls
directly on the headphones. They are a bit more expensive but are well
worth the price. If you want to write quality music you need equipment
that can display the full spectrum of your track.

Dont even think about using your computer monitor as your only guiding
line. Then you are in trouble even before it has actually started.

On its way..
-------------
If you have synths you might  prefer starting jamming around with them
finding some nice leads or chords but  I  will in this example use the
tracker as only reference.

Start with loading a set  of  samples  into  the  tracker. If you have
loadable patches of drums and  such  that  is  the ultimate way to get
things on its way.

Spend some minutes  listening  to  the  instruments  and finetune them
against each other. I take it for granted as you know how to tune your
samples. If you dont then I  suggest  you  skip this article until you
have reached the skill level needed to fully understand this article.

Find some useful short sequences  that  you  easily can track down and
dont pay  to  much  attention  to  the  technical  difficulty  of  the
sequence. You want to be able  to  easy  change the lead without being
forced to completely remove every command used. Stick with notes only,
if the notes dont sound good without commands then they will not sound
100% ok with the commands/effects anyway.

Save different versions of your songs  often.If you dont use a tracker
with infinite undo steps then its  good  to have different versions of
the song saved so you can go back if you make some horrible misstakes.

Only saving one  version  of  the  song  is  plain  stupidity and only
hinders you in your progress towards the track of your dreams.

Saving single drum/lead/chord patterns/tracks is  also a good idea. It
takes up very limited space and  is  a  very good way of ensuring that
you always have the possibility to  go  back  in the track if you find
that you have thrashed it.

Well you are on your way  to  creating  your  track now, but havent we
forgotten some things?  Yes  we  have,  some  really  important things
aswell. We started  the  session  without  food!  And  we  did this on
purpose. Now you have spent about  an hour tracking your initial leads
and a chord structure has started  to  evolve. But now your body needs
fuel. Your  brain  needs  some  carbohydrates  and  your  muscles some
protein to avoid  breakdown  of  muscle-tissue  after  the long nights
sleep.

Take a short break and visit the kitchen in which you should make sure
you have the following groceries at home at all times.

Regarding body types such as ectomorph or endormorph body types i have
not taken any notice  of  the  difference  between  the two.  You have
subtypes of these groups as well but this is mainly about tracking not
biology.  Even though the technical bits  in  this article is way much
more complex than the average tracker article.

Breakfast. (things to have at home at all times)
----------
Cottage cheese (protein source)
Milk           (protein, fat source)
Juice          (carbohydrates)
Bread (grain)  (carbohydrates, fiber)
Cayenne pepper (use on cottage cheese)
Fruit          (bananas, grapefruit, apples)
Oatmeal


Multivitamin

Strong doses,  forget  the  pharmacy  crap.  Get  twinlab  or ultimate
nutrition stuff. A good choice  is  the  "daily one" packages that are
available.

Just make sure the product has been approved by the FDA (food and drug
administration). You should have been taken the vitamines for a longer
period of time to get your body  used  to it. You need to slowly upper
your dose until so  you  will  not  get  any stomach problems. Certain
vitamins has a tendency to cause stomage upsets in bigger doses.

Examples of those vitamins are Vitamin D  and one example of a mineral
is iron, which are both known to  cause vomiting if overdosed. As milk
contains vitamin D aswell you need  to make sure that the multivitamin
package do not contain more than about 100% of the daily need.

Your every day breakfast should  have  about 50% carbohydrates 25% and
25% of fat. You dont have to  worry  about not getting enough fat from
your diet. Neither or adding extra fat to it. Its enough of it already
as it is.

The high amount of carbohydrates has been set to let you endure longer
sessions infront of the tracker before  having to refuel. Eating candy
whilst  doing  some  advanced  tracking  is  a  bad  idea,  it  raises
bloodsugar levels very rapidly and then  drops  very fast giving you a
feeling of tiredness, fatigue  which  can  destroy  the energy of your
track as your current energy  level,  is  often being reflected in the
song.

Eat a good balanced breakfast and  your  results  in all parts of your
life will improve.

Lets continue with the tracking
-------------------------------
After a healthy and full of energy breakfast, you are now ready to get
back to the creation process.

While you were eating, im sure you were thinking alot of what you want
to add next in the  track,  and  what  things  that should be removed.
Maybe you after the breakfast  now  finds  that the last pattern made,
really wasnt as  good  as  the  ones  before.  Remove  it  as  soon as
possible, and start all over.

If you are not happy with one part  of  your song. Save it as a backup
file and then remove the patterns, maybe you will find the need to go
back to that pattern and rework/reconstruct it later on.

Dont be satisfied with  anything  less  than  what  you for the moment
think is really good music. If  you  dont like your music, dont expect
anyone else to do it either.

Time passes...
--------------
About three to four hours later your track should have started to take
real form and have parts clearly divided  from each other and a catchy
lead to sum it all up. The  endpart  is probably not done yet but that
is one of the least important things  to  think of right now. You need
to attract the listeners attention  early  on  in  the song, or he/she
will only fastforward it  and  forget  about  it  real quickly or even
worse just erase the  track  right  away  after  hearing  the intro no
matter how good the rest of the song is.

Pitstop
----------
It is now time to get  some  more  fuel  into your temple (your body).
Some quick carbohydrates whilst preparing for the next tracker session
is the way to go here.

Eat some fruits (preferable bananas)  my  favourite  recipe here is to
take 2 bananas mix them with one package of light ice cream (vanilla)
add some peanut butter  (very  high  on  protein  even  though the fat
content is really scary) mix it all together with a blender for a few
seconds, then drink the whole damn thing  and voila you will give your
body all the building blocks it need to keep the engine running.

Drink some extra juice (2-3 glasses)  to  keep the fluids high. If you
want to drink some  coffee  you  need  to  think  of  that the caffein
destroys the vitamin Cand you should try to keep atleast 30 minutes or
so between the juice and the coffee intake.

Furthermore it helps the digestion keeping the meals parted this way.
It speeds up metabolism and you can eat more and still not gain weight
if you are worried about that.

Take your time eating. If you are like me you want to get back to the
tracking as soon as  possible  but  having  scheduled pauses like this
helps you keeping your concentration  high  and better music will come
out of it in the end.

Back on track
----------------
Time to start on some of the details.
Do  a  song/pattern   cleanup,   remove   unused  samples/instruments/
midipatches and also all unused pattern/tracks/midich not used. If you
were using drumpatches you dont  want  the  samples to be deleted just
yet if they are unused as you  most  probably want to use some of them
as fill/solos later on in the refinement section.

Switch to headphones. As its  getting  late  its  a good thing to calm
things down a bit and spare you  from getting angry neighbours at your
door.

Listen threw the song from  the  start  to  the  end.  Dont stop it to
change errors (if you havent forgot  to  switch off some loops that is
that keeps going forever threw the  entire song). Take notes on things
you would like to improve and then  make  a most important list out of
that.

Start with the most  important  things  to  change and move downwards.
This process usually takes several  hours  so  make  sure you get some
fruit or a well balanced meal into  your  system to keep up your blood
sugar levels.

When all this has been done Its  time  to  save your work for the day.
Make backups to both hd and floppydisk.  If  its not to late call your
girlfriend/boyfriend and tell them that you  are done with todays work
and that you know have some time to spare....

Next day
----------
Dont listen to the tune. Take a day off from tracking and do something
useful with your friends or someone you love very much. If not. Irc is
a good alternative..:-)

Taking a pause from the tune is a good way to check the quality of the
composition. When you the following day  return  to your tune you will
find it full of glaring errors  and  things  to  fix. Do a list of the
things to change as usual and arrange them in most important order and
get down to it.

Once again save it and forget all about  it until the next day. As the
main work was made the first day/night you still need to make sure you
eat  a  solid  diet  all  the  time  to  keep  concentration  at  peak
performance.

When you find after few more days like this that the list of things on
your "things to change list" is  decreasing  or reaching zero its time
to ask for a second opinion. Contact  some of your tracker friends and
send/give him the module. Make him write his first impression of the
track and things he liked or disliked about the tune.
Evaluate his ideas but dont let it get to you if you find that he only
nagged on the tune not giving you any positive feedback at all.

Just send the  tune  to  another  of  your  friends  and  do  the same
procedure there. Compare the two  friends  thoughts about the tune and
look for similarities.

If they both point out the same  things  you should take a closer look
on those and try to think of a  better way to solve it if possible. Do
the necessary changes and resend  the  tune  to the friends. You might
have to do this procedure  over  and  over  again, its boring but well
worth  it  in  the  end.  When  working  with  one  single  tune  this
intensively it is  easy  to  start  to  think  that  the  tune  is not
reallyany good at  all.  Sweep  this  ideas  to  the  side. you should
instead be confident by now that you  have a really good tune going on
that will be known as one of the really great ones.

Releasing your tune
-------------------
Things to think of before final release of the song and some things to
include in the track text or in a readme.txt file.

- Credit the people you have ripped samples from if any.
- Always put in release date.
- Contact addy, both email and snailmail.
  People do wanna contact you, sometimes just for a little comment but
  sometimes also with requests for more songs or wanting you to write
  tracks for his/her production.
- Post the track on just one of the news-servers, it will find its way
  to the other ones anyway.
- alt.binaries.music.mods is the correct place to post your mods.
  Don't use alt.music.mods People do get very upset if posting files
  here.
- Make the file accessible on the most videly used mod sites such as:
- http://traxinspace.com Over 1200 artists registered here. The
  number one place for all the best composers.
- http://hornet.org Very scene related, dont post single files here if
  possible, try to post "musicdisks" instead. You will   get more
  people downloading your files this way as noone at hornet checks the
  single files /incoming, its just to   huge!
- Use an original filename! Dont go for:Techno xxx, trance xxx or
  whatever..Why not instead use:
  "the day i tonguekissed my mom" :-))

Closing words
-------------
As i hope you have understood not  everything in this article is to be
taken 100% serious.  But  you  can  use  most  of  it  to enhance your
tracking and reaching new levels of  the  world of tracking. After all
sometimes tracking can be just spending an hour infront of the tracker
writing some dance/techno under an hour.

We do need to have fun sometimes as well...
