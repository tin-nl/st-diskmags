It is strange to  think  that  the  most  successful piece of computer
hardware this decade  hasn't  come  from  Intel,  Nintendo, Sega, IBM,
MicroSoft, Silicon Graphics,  Compaq,  Motorola  or  even  our beloved
Atari. A company with  no  track  record  in  the  computer or console
industry has come from nowhere and taken the market by storm. The Sony
Playstation is the computer entertainment success story of the 90s.

It takes a lot to  impress  a  hall  full  of demo coders and computer
freaks, and in early 1995 in Bremen Germany a lot of us got to see our
first glimpse of the PSX.  The  party  organisers  of Fried Bits 3 had
just got hold of one of these machines and presented it to us all on a
large projection screen. At the time it was incredible - there was not
another machine on the market that could cope with the amount of polys
it was throwing around. Top end  PCs  of the day couldn't compete with
this, let alone the Falcon and Amiga 1200.

This technical ability combined with Sony's ruthless marketing saw the
playstation find its way into  over  50 million homes. The competition
from the Jaguar and Saturn was akin to ASH going up against MicroSoft.
By the time the technically superior  Nintendo 64 was released, it was
too late. The  PSX  had  swallowed  a  large  part  of  the market and
Ninentdo was left with crumbs.

It is now 5 years  since  the  Playstation's  release,  and as we know
computers and consoles age  very  quickly.  Playstation games now look
substandard, the glitches and problems  with  the hardware have become
more and more obvious. Top end PCs with the best graphics cards are so
far ahead of the  PSX  technically  it  is  laughable. The playstation
doesn't even have a z-buffer for god's sake! Yet the sales of PC games
remain sluggish, and this christmas  more  playstations were sold than
ever before.

Japanese gamers were lucky enough  to  get  their  hands on Sega's new
console, the  Dreamcast,  this  Christmas.  The  Dreamcast's  power is
comparable to today's top end PCs  and  it  also  has the benefit of a
very  nice  graphics  chip.  At  last   Sega  have  woken  up  to  the
possibilities of 3D, something they ignored with the Saturn.

Whilst the Dreamcast is a very nice machine and is probably just ahead
of current PC technology, by  the  time  of  its European release this
september the PC will have caught up,  and  it won't be long before it
is showing its age  again.  The  current  range of Dreamcast software,
whilst nice, doesn't really do anything  that is impossible on the PC.
It is not as far ahead  of  the  competition  as  the PSX was in 1994.
Given the rapid march  of  technology,  the  lifespan of the Dreamcast
looks limited.

Sony have the number one brandname and  a huge amount of money to sell
their new console with. They could  have  given the PSX2 similar specs
to the Dreamcast  and  still  outperformed  Sega  simply  on marketing
acumen. But  Sony  are  more  forward  looking  than  this,  they have
designed a console that is not only  the natural successor to the PSX,
but leapfrogs the DreamCast and all current PCs.


Given the rapid expansion in PC  technology  over the last 5 years, it
has been hard  to  see  how  console  manufactures  could compete. CPU
manufacturers like Intel and AMD have been doubling the speed of their
processors every 18 months, and there are now a whole load of graphics
card manufacturers pushing the  polygon  performance  of the PC. Cards
from people like 3DFX and nVidia significantly outperform the consoles
and have been getting better every year.

The gap between the PC and  consoles  couldn't be much greater than it
is today. The playstation has 33Mhz CPU and 2MB of main memory and 1Mb
of graphics memory. If  you  were  to  buy  a  new  PC today, it would
probably have a 500mhz Pentium 3  processor,  at least 128MB of memory
and graphics card with at least  8Mb  of  memory. It can run in higher
resolutions and offer graphics  that  look  a  lot  smoother thanks to
techniques such as  bi-linear  filtering.  The  polygon  throughput of
these cards is also considerably greater than that of the PSX.

The strange thing is that these vastly powerful PCs with their arsenal
of graphics processing  power  have  made  little  impact  on  the PSX
market. PC games sell notoriously badly - even though they are cheaper
than PSX games,  the  playstation  version  of  a  game will typically
outsell the PC by 4 to 1.

And its not just  the  software  that  is  selling  - people are still
buying thousands and  thousands  of  playstations.  The  demand was so
great at christmas that they  ran  out  of stock. Manufacturers of PCs
and graphics cards must be  scratching  their heads and wondering what
they are doing wrong. Even with  its  huge technical advantage, the PC
is losing out to the PSX.

Details about  the  PSX2  have  been  shrouded  in  secrecy.  With the
playstation selling so well, why  damage  the market by announcing its
successor? But even Sony realise that the  PSX  is near the end of its
life, and they could do  with  firing  a  shot  across the bows of the
DreamCast.

It takes a lot to impress a  room  full of games coders, especially PC
coders with a natural dislike of consoles. But at my games company the
announcement of the PSX2 left a  load  of gaping mouths and mutters of
"this can't be right". One  DirectX  coder was overhead saying "that's
it, I give up now!"

The PSX2 specs are not good - they are astounding.

The CPU is a 300mhz RISC chips based on the MIPS instruction set. RISC
chips are a lot faster than  CISC  equivalents  at the same clock rate
(just compare  Motorola's  G4  to  Intel's  Pentium  series).  This is
supported with 3 co-processors, an FPU with a floating point MAC and a
Divider, another floating point unit with  4  MACs and a divider and a
third floating point unit with 5  MACs  and 2 dividers. This gives its
an awesome floating point performance  of  6.2  GigaFlops, more than 3
times as powerful as the new Pentium 3 processors. Its capacity for 3D
maths is unrivalled.

It has a huge amount of memory  for  a console - 32Mb. Whilst this may
seem small compared to  the  PC,  it  doesn't  have  to  cope with the
massive footprint of windows. The DreamCast  has 16Mb and bear in mind
that it has to cope with Windows  CE. The memory bandwidth of the PSX2
is excellent - it can transfer 3.2 GigaBytes a second.

With this floating  point  perfomance,  it  can  transform  66 Million
Polygons a second ( that  includes  perspective transformation ). Even
with an additional lighting calculation,  it  can calculate 38 million
polys a second. For particle effects,  it can transform an amazing 150
million pixels a second.

But it is no good having  all  this  huge calculation capacity if your
graphics chip can't keep up. If you  pushed it, the original PSX could
do about 6,000 polys a frame - that's 300,000 polys a second at 50hz.

The PSX2's GPU has the pretentious  name of "Graphics Synthesiser". It
runs at a clock frequency of  150mhz  and has 16 pixel engines. Whilst
the only effects that  the  PSX's  GPU  offered  were Gouraud Shading,
Texture Mapping and a limited form  of Transparency, the PSX2 has Bump
Mapping, MIP-Mapping, Anti-Aliasing, Alpha  Blending, Fogging and both
Bi-Linear and Tri-Linear Filtering. It also  has a Z-Buffer so no more
horrible poly sorting problems!

This graphics chip is very  well  designed,  it has an incredible 2560
bit bus (yes, that's two thousand  five  hundred and sixty bit!). This
gives it a bandwidth of 48 GigaBytes per second. This gives it a pixel
fill rate of 2.4 GigaPixels  per  second.  It can effectively draw 150
millions pixels a second, which  nicely  ties  in with the 3D particle
calculation rate.

Remember the old  school  consoles  that  had  '64'  or '256' hardware
sprites? This seemed a lot  and  very  impressive compared to the ST's
sprite capabilities. Well the PSX2  has  upped  the ante somewhat, and
can draw 18.75 Million sprites a second. Enough for most games I would
think!

Like the PSX, its 3D performance is  better  than its 2D. The PSX2 can
draw 75 Million polys  a  second  -  an  astonishing figure. Even with
Texture Mapping, Z-Buffering and  Alpha  Channeling  it can display 25
million polys a second.

This kind of performance is  far,  far  ahead  of  even the top of the
range graphics cards for the PC. You  could spend over 2,000 UK pounds
on a PC with Pentium 3  and  the  best  graphics card and see it being
outperfomed by a 200 pound console.

This must be worrying to PC manufacturers. In recent years, the PC has
tried to market itself more and  more  as a games machine. The success
of this strategy has been  limited  -  games companies like writing PC
games as it is less demanding to  develop  on and profits per game are
higher. Yet the games sell in  pitifull quantities and people are much
happier buying consoles to play games on.

Whilst Sega have got into bed  with  Microsoft with the DreamCast ( it
runs a version of  Windows  CE  to  allow  easy  PC  ports ), Sony are
resolutely alone. Given the technology in this machine, they could not
only challenge the PC games market but other aspects of software. This
sort of technology could outperform  the  PC on graphics applications,
renderers and even  net  browsers.  If  Sony  ever  decided  to make a
computer or expand the functionality of the PSX2 then MicroSoft should
be very worried.

It would cost other  graphics  card  manufacturers  over 1000 pounds a
unit to make hardware similar to  the  PSX2  and no-one would pay 1000
pounds for a console. Sony  can  afford  to  make  a huge loss on each
console they sell because they have made so much from PSX software and
they now they will make  an  equally  huge  figure from PSX2 software.
Manufacturers of PC graphics card do not have this luxury - they don't
get 7 pounds back from every  PC  game  bought. To catch the PSX2 they
have to develop similar hardware  and  then wait for the manufacturing
costs to come down which will take  some  time - by this time the PSX2
will have a dominant grip on the market.

For the PC to compete against consoles it can't just be better, it has
to be significantly better. And  the  PC won't be significantly better
than the PSX2 for at least 3 years. And even this may not be enough to
temp people away from a cheap but enormously powerful console which it
easy to use and has a vast array of software.


You may wonder why this article is  in  Maggie - what has the PSX2 got
to do with atari? Given the  capabilities  of the PSX2 it could change
the current computer market. The PC is going  to have to go a long way
to keep up, and during this  time  Sony's profits will keep rising and
they can plough the money into developing  the PSX3 which can again be
ahead of the competition. It will be hard to break their stranglehold.

With all this money and  technology,  you  have to wonder whether sony
will ever go into the  computer  industry  -  it has the capability to
design a computer to challenge the  PC  and the financial resources to
back it up. Imagine a  computer  that  could  play PSX2 games and also
give  you  internet  access  and   have   a   range  of  office  style
applications. The  amount  of  software  you  need  for  a  successful
computer is relatively  small  (  word  processor,  art package, music
package, email package, net browser,  some  utilities ). Most software
is just small variations on these  genres. Sony have come from nowhere
to dominate the computer games industry  -  it would be interesting to
see what would happen if they turned their minds to other areas of the
computer industry.

PC manufacturers surivive by selling consumers new hardware. If people
don't keep buying new CPUs and  new  graphics  cards then they will go
out of business.  And  what  encourages  people  to  buy  new CPUs and
Graphics Cards? People aren't going  to  buy  a  Voodoo  3 to get more
performance from their word  processor.  Intel's desperate claims that
the Pentium 3 makes the internet faster  have been laughed at by all -
the speed of your CPU has  very  little  to  do  with the speed of the
internet. The main thing that  encourages  people  to buy new PCs, and
certainly new graphics cards, is games.

Thousands of people were tempting away  from  their atari to the nasty
PC on seeing 'Doom'.  And  ID  caused  more  atari casualties with the
release of 'Quake'. A very  small  amount  of people have been tempted
away from the  atari  by  Microsoft  Word.  It  is  games  and amazing
graphics that showcase the PC and lure people into buying it.

A lot of people may say that  they  want  a PC for working on or doing
their homework with, but  in  reality  they  just  want to play 'half-
life'.

The cumbersome nature of the PC serves to put a lot of people off. The
fact that even CD based games dump  hundreds of megabytes of data onto
your hard drive is also a  pain.  Consoles are an efortless solution -
just put in the game  and  switch  it  on.  PCs  will never be able to
compete with this ease of use.

It is amusing that one of the most popular areas of software on the PC
are emulators. It is funny that  people  would rather run the software
of other computers and play console games  than use all the 'great' PC
software. The latest machine that  PC  emulates  is  the N64.

So is a PSX2 emulator feasible  on  a  PC?  Not  for a very long time.
Playstation emulators have only  arrived  relatively recently and they
aren't great. To emulate a different machine, you need roughly 4 times
the processing power of the emulated  platform. Just look at the speed
of PC you need to run a gameboy emulator at a decent framerate. The PC
has to go a hell of long way  to  catch up the PSX2, let alone attempt
to emulate it. By this time, Sony will have their next machine out.

It is interesting that the companies  Sony talked about competing with
in their Tokyo presentation of the PSX2 weren't Sega or Nintendo. They
know they have already beaten them.  They were talking about taking on
Microsoft and Intel.

Some people are of the opinion  that  the  PSX2 is "only a console, it
could never challenge the pc". This is a somewhat simplistic and short
sighted view. At the lowest level, PC  users  may buy a PSX2 for games
and have no incentive to upgrade their  PC. What's the point of buying
a new graphics card for your PC if your 200 pound console out performs
it?

On the next level, there is the talk  of the PSX2 running Unix. It can
have development tools running on the console itself rather than a PC.
There are manufactures of graphics software working on PSX2 packages.

At the moment the PSX2 is not  a  replacement for a home computer. But
it certainly has  the  capabilities  to  be  a  home  computer,  and a
computer that beats its competition.  It  has  a faster processor than
the fastest PCs and far  better  graphical capabilities. It can output
to VGA monitors. It has enough  memory  to run large applications. The
only difference between the PC  and  the  PSX2  is  that  the PC has a
keyboard, mouse, hard drive and more memory. And is slower.

Given this power,  a  challenge  to  the  dominant  PC  is  not so far
fetched. In the business  environment  the  PC  will  always be king -
there are  too  many  specialised  applications  needed  by  different
companies from anything to challenge it. The PC came from the business
world and  it  may  be  sent  back  there.  The  home  market  is very
different.

The I/O processor  of  the  PSX2  is  ridiculously  powerful  -  it is
bascially an  enhanced  version  of  the  CPU  used  in  the  original
PlayStation, the mips R3000. This allows it to be backwards compatible
with the original  machine  thus  giving  a  huge established software
base. It  will  probably  send  the  graphics  through  the  'graphics
synthesiser', so like UltraHLE the  games  could look better. It could
use the GS's bi-linear filtering to make the graphics look smoother.

Interestingly  the  I/O  processor's   keyboard   and  mouse  handling
capabilities are highlighted by Sony,  an  indication of the area they
may want the system to move into.

Sony has the  best  hardware,  a  good  reputation  with the consumer,
brilliant marketing strategies, and,  most importantly, huge financial
resources. It has captured the  console  market,  and I can't see this
position being challenged by Sega  or  Nintendo. The next logical step
is it to move  into  is  the  home  computer  market.  It has hardware
capable of performing the PC in all areas, and it can sell it cheaper.


For us atari users, any machine  that halts the relentless monopoly of
the PC in any area is good. It  proves that there is an alternative to
this dinosaur machine, that other companies can do things better.

SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT  ANNOUNCES  WORLD'S  FASTEST  128  Bit CPU
"EMOTION ENGINE" FOR THE NEXT GENERATION PLAYSTATION


TOKYO, March 2, 1999 - Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. is pleased to
announce the co-development with  Toshiba  Corp.  of  the  128 bit CPU

("EE",  or  "Emotion  Engine  for  use  in   the  next  generation  of
PlayStation In order  to   process   massive  multi-media  information
at  the  fastest possible speeds,  data  bus,  cache memory as well as
all registers are 128 bits; this  is  integrated  on a single chip LSI
together with the state  of  the  art  0.18 micron process technology.
The development of a full 128-bit CPU is  the first of its kind in the
world.

Not only will this new CPU have  application for games, but it will be
the  core   media   processor   for   future   digital   entertainment
applications, and  has a  vastly  superior  floating point calculation
capability compared to the  latest  personal  computers.   The new CPU
incorporates two 64-bit integer units (IU)  with a 128-bit SIMD multi-
media command unit, two independent  floating point vector calculation
units  (VU0,  VU1),  an  MPEG  2  decoder  circuit  (Image  Processing
Unit/IPU) and high performance DMA  controllers onto one silicon chip.
The massive  combined  performance  of  this  CPU  permits complicated
physical calculation, NURBS curved surface generation and 3D geometric
transformations, which are difficult to  perform  in real time with PC
CPUs, to be performed at high speeds.

In addition, by processing the data at 128-bits on one chip, it is
possible to process and transfer massive volumes of multi-media data.
 CPUs on conventional PCs have a basic data structure of 64 bits, with
only 32 bits on recent game consoles.  The main memory supporting the
high speed CPU uses the Direct Rambus( DRAM in two channels to achieve
a  3.2GB/second  bus  bandwidth.  This   equates  to  four  times  the
performance  of  the  latest  PCs   that   are  built  on  the  PC-100
architecture.

By incorporating the MPEG 2 decoder circuitry on one chip, it is now
possible to simultaneously process high-resolution 3D graphics data at
the same time as high quality DVD images.  The combination of the two
allows the introduction of a new approach to digital entertainment and
real-time graphics and audio processing.

With a floating point calculation performance of 6.2GFLOPS/second, the
overall calculation performance of  this  new  CPU  matches  that of a
super computer.  When this is  applied  to the processing of geometric
and perspective transformations normally used in the calculation of 3D
computer graphics (3DCG), the peak calculation performance reaches 66
million polygons per second. This  performance is comparable with that
of  high-end  graphics  workstations  (GWS)  used  in  motion  picture
production.

SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT ANNOUNCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD'S
FASTEST GRAPHICS RENDERING PROCESSOR USING EMBEDDED DRAM TECHNOLOGY



TOKYO, March 2, 1999 - Sony Computer Entertainment has developed the
Graphics  Synthesizer   for   the   next   generation   PlayStation(r)
incorporating a massively parallel rendering  engine  that  contains a
2,560 bit wide data bus  that  is  20  times   the   size  of  leading
PC-based  graphics accelerators.
 Very high pixel fill rates and drawing performance is achieved only
through the use of embedded  DRAM  process technology pioneered by SCE
for use in advanced graphics technology.

The  current  PlayStation  introduced  the  concept  of  the  Graphics
Synthesizer via  the  real-time  calculation  and  rendering  of  a 3D
object.
 This new GS rendering processor is the ultimate incarnation of this
concept - delivering unrivalled  graphics  performance and capability.
The rendering  function  was  enhanced  to  generate  image  data that
supports NTSC/PAL Television,  High  Definition  Digital  TV  and VESA
output standards.   The  quality  of  the  resulting  screen  image is
comparable to movie-quality 3D graphics in real time.

In the design of graphics systems, the rendering capability is defined
by the memory bandwidth between the pixel engine and the video memory.
 Conventional systems use external  VRAM  reached  via an off-chip bus
that limits the total performance  of   the   system.   However in the
case of the new GS, there  is a  48-Gigabyte  memory  access bandwidth
achieved via the integration of the  pixel  logic and the video memory
on a single high performance  chip.  This  allows orders  of magnitude
greater pixel fill-rate performance compared  to today's best PC-based
graphics accelerators.

When rendering small polygons, the peak drawing capacity is 75 Million
polygons per second and the  system  can  render 150 Million particles
per second. With this  large  drawing  capability,  it  is possible to
render a movie-quality image. With Z-buffering, textures, lighting and
alpha blending (transparency), a sustained rate of 20 Million polygons
per second can be drawn continuously.

This new architecture can also execute recursive multi-pass rendering
processing and filter operations at a very fast speed without the
assistance of the main CPU  or  main  bus  access.   In the past, this
level of real-time  performance  was  only  achieved  when  using very
expensive, high performance, dedicated graphics workstations. However,
with the design of  the  new  Graphics  Synthesizer, this high quality
image  is   now   available   for   in-home   computer   entertainment
applications. This will help  accelerate  the  convergence of  movies,
music   and  computer  technology   into   a   new   form  of  digital
entertainment.

SONY COMPUTER  ENTERTAINMENT  ANNOUNCES  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  AN  I/O
PROCESSOR FOR  THE  NEXT  GENERATION  PLAYSTATION  THAT  PROVIDES 100%
BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY


TOKYO, March 2, 1999 -  Sony  Computer Entertainment has developed the
I/O  Processor   with   LSI   Logic    Corporation    for   the   next
generation PlayStation.
 By  embedding  this  processor   we   have   achieved  100%  backward
compatibility with the current PlayStation.   In addition, the new I/O
Processor supports IEEE 1394 and Universal  Serial Bus (USB) which are
the new standards for digital interconnectivity.

The new I/O Processor for the  next generation PlayStation is based on
the current PlayStation CPU but  with   enhanced  cache  memory  and a
new, higher performance  DMA  architecture  that  permits  a four-fold
increase in data  transfer  rates.   The  serial   interface  is  also
upgraded  to over 20 times the performance of the current PlayStation.
In addition, the USB  host  controller  and  the  IEEE 1394  link  and
physical layers are integrated onto this single chip LSI.

The USB  interface  is  compatible  with  OHCI  (Open  Host Controller
Interface) and can handle data transfer rates of between 1.5Mbps and
12Mbps (Mega bits per  second).   IEEE  1394  can handle data transfer
rates of between 100 Mbps and 400 Mbps.

The use of these interfaces allows the future connectivity of the new
PlayStation system to a variety of other systems and consumer products
such as VCR, Set Top Box,  Digital Camera, Printer, Joystick, Keyboard
and Mouse amongst others.

SONY  COMPUTER  ENTERTAINMENT  ANNOUNCES   THE   DESIGN  OF  THE  NEXT
GENERATION PLAYSTATION SYSTEM



TOKYO, March 2,  1999  -  Sony  Computer  Entertainment  is pleased to
announce the completion of  its  research  and  development project to
design the successor  to  the  PlayStation  that  was first introduced
during 1994 in Japan. The advanced  technology of  the next generation
system provides the basis for an  exciting  new era of in-home digital
entertainment.

With over 50 Million units  shipped  to date, the original PlayStation
game  console  radically  changed    the    landscape   for   computer
entertainment with the  introduction  of  real-time  3D graphics which
significantly enhanced the possibilities  for creative expression over
conventional 2D graphics-based systems.

The next generation PlayStation massively increases the quality and
performance of graphics technology to the maximum level that can be
enjoyed on a television set through the innovative design of its new
Graphics Synthesizer. The new Graphics Synthesizer will give software
experiences for the next generation PlayStation unparalleled graphic
quality  and  detail.  The   next  generation  PlayStation  technology
combines this richly detailed  graphic  quality with the revolutionary
ability  to  generate    worlds,     characters,     behaviours    and
complex  physical simulations in  real-time  via the massive floating-
point processing power of the system.

This  powerful  combination   allows   for   new   types  of  computer
entertainment to be created. For example, the  hair  and clothing of a
character can  be  effected  by  a   digital   wind   calculated   and
processed  in  real-time.  Other   examples    include   the   dynamic
simulation  of   real-world   physical  attributes  such  as  gravity,
friction,   mass   and   the    accurate    simulation   of  different
materials such as water, wood,  metal  and  gas.  This will change the
future of computer entertainment forever.

This concept is called "Emotion Synthesis(" which allows the system to
simulate not just how  the  images  look,  but  how the characters and
objects in a game think,  act   and  behave.  This  concept requires a
computer system with a massive floating-point mathematical calculation
capability far beyond  the  current  state-of-the-art workstations and
approaches the performance  of  large-scale  super  computers used for
scientific simulation.

The next generation PlayStation  has  at  its  heart  a  CPU with data
processing capabilities far exceeding  those  of  today's state of the
art PCs and with a rendering   processor  that has greater performance
than that of  the   highest   level    graphics   workstations.   This
allows  for unparalleled real-time  computer  graphics expressions and
techniques to be used in software  for the first time. Imagine walking
into the screen and experiencing  a  movie  in real-time...this is the
world we are about to enter.

In addition to the technology  of  conventional CD-ROM, the new system
also adopts the future generation of disc media, DVD-ROM, to allow for
the storage of massive amounts of data and large programs. Because the
calculation performance of the new  system  can reduce the requirement
for massive data structures on the  disc, we believe that the capacity
of conventional CD-ROMs will be appropriate for certain applications.
However, in  the  future  we  anticipate  the  need  for  larger, high
capacity  storage  mediums  required  by  the  new  forms  of  digital
entertainment created by Emotion Synthesis.




In  addition,  the  new  system   employs  MPEG2  image  decompression
technology, widely used today  for  image-based  DVDs. This allows for
the  storage  of  compressed  image   data   for  texture   maps   and
background data that can then be decompressed in real-time as required
by the application. The resulting  image  quality not only matches the
computer graphic quality generated by the  system but is  also  of the
highest quality available for in-home use.

In the vital  area  of  sound  processing,  we  have  gone  beyond the
capabilities of the current PlayStation to allow for even more complex
digital  enhancement  and  processing  of  sound  effects  and  music.
Software  generated   sounds,   using    the    massive    calculation
performance of the system  and  complex   enhancements  to  the  sound
processor,  allows  for the  encoding  and  processing  of advanced 3D
digital  sound  techniques  such  as  AC-3  and  DTS.  With  this leap
forward  in   technology,   we  anticipate  a  New  World  of  digital
entertainment that will surpass  the  experience of conventional video
and music CDs.

With over 3,000 titles currently available for the current PlayStation
worldwide, we have designed the new system to be backward compatible,
therefore, allowing consumers to continue to enjoy their library of
software. This was made possible  by  integrating  a new I/O Processor
that uses a 32-bit core identical to the current PlayStation system,
permitting the accurate interchange of data and programs with the rest
of the new system.

Sony Computer Entertainment will incorporate  this new technology into
the next generation PlayStation that  is  planned  to be released into
the  Japanese market during  the  fiscal  year  ending  March 2000. An
overseas introduction is planned  to  follow  in  the  fall  of  2000.
To allow software developers to  begin  developing  new titles to take

advantage of this powerful new technology, development systems will be
made available starting this spring.

The next generation PlayStation system announced here is a significant
part of Sony Computer Entertainment's mission to create "a new form of
entertainment beyond games" via the integration of innovative computer
technology with digital AV technology.
