If music be the food of love, then don't get the Spice Boys 
compilation.. CiH here, the proud holder of the title of 'Third Worst 
Musician on the Atari Scene!' (I'll get you next time Marcer, I will!) 
Anyway, that, and some much better efforts are up on the reviewers slab 
for this time..

 The Softer Side of Toodeloo.. 

A new trend seems to be for music compilation demos to get bigger and 
bigger as the artistes on the musical side of things are given full 
expressive licence.. It may also be something to do with the near 
universality of the Internet, as many people no longer feel restrained 
by having to accomodate to a limited floppy disk format.. Anyway, what 
else are we to make of this effort, which weighs in at over three megs 
worth..

The 'Softer Side of Toodeloo' is actually the result of a collaboration 
between Toodeloo, and YesCREW.. Toodeloo having several tunes of a 
'softer' funk or R&B nature, but he was totally unable to persuade Evil 
to make a music demo with them, as Evil wasn't into that sort of 
music..

This has a fairly simple interface, yet another picture of the man and 
his back-to-front baseball cap! Just what the world needs, another 
Toodeloo 'staring into the middle distance' exclusive! Tunes are 
selectable via the Function keys, and the first tune 'Groove me', with 
its mellow rolling piano and wacka-wacka guitar sets the tone for ten 
tunes worth of laid-back lazing-on-the-patio-on-a-hot-summer-day..

You'll either enjoy or loathe the slow soft shoe shuffle, but whatever 
your tastes, you can't deny the sheer craftsmanship of such songs as 
'In the Kitchen' where some smart vocals are effortlessly blended into 
the song.. The final track, 'Mixed Emotions' brings with it, a hint of 
'Chippin' demo sounds past and future, whilst not losing the 'fluffy' 
theme of the compilation..

 75% - If someone on the Atari scene has to be over-producing, it might 
 as well be Toodeloo!


 Digital RelaXatioN..

This is SWE of YesCREW and IRC fame debuting into the world of music 
compilation demos.. It follows the well-trodden Dead Hackers path, but 
goes for a hybrid chip/'proper' module approach with a mixture of the 
two.. 

The massively prolific Toodeloo provides the riffs and rough cuts, 
apart from one 505 derived effort somewhere in the middle, and a not 
very well 'hidden' tune from a famous early Falcon demo..

The screen lives up to its 'Digital Relaxation' motif with a pleasant 
recurring ripple pattern, and a (controllable) scrolling fantasy story 
of a boy and his magic flute.. This is it though, and the story is a 
bit on the short side.. The music is really the thing here..

Most of the bigger modules seem to follow the 'softer side of 
Toodeloo', and are spacious and fairly mellow.. The chip mods are 
funkier, the 'Chippin' for Air tribute tune blatantly cheesy.. Sound 
quality on all the tunes is the full 50 khz wonderfulness..

 72% - This SWE effort isn't a turnip!


 Spice Boys - The worst music compil ever!

Now some people might be concerned with the virtual monopoly by the 
Dead Hackers Society, and their omnipresent musician Toodeloo, of the 
music compilation demo scene.. A response was hastily flung together, 
by, errm, The Dead Hackers Society, in organising a competition for the 
'least worst musician out of all the non-musicians on the Atari scene', 
which is proably about half a dozen of us left, who have a tin ear, and 
no real talent for making sounds work in line with each other..

A mysterious group called the 'Spice Boys' kidnapped the competition 
results, and made up their own simple compilation and they seemed to do 
a reasonable job of it, in spite of two of their members being 
pregnant, sorry, looking  pregnant!!

Here it is, blow by tortured blow..

In reverse reverse order, that is, the least worst, or "best" first??

At 22 points, Evl of DHS.. So, they have to win everything, it seems, 
but we know better! This is less of a comedy tune, and more of a tune 
which could be okay with a bit more work and golden years of experience 
on Evil's part.. Decent samples, a good intro, and 'almost, but not 
quite there' melody suggest to me that this is not really a 'worst 
ever'?

Carbon is next, he has gone for the smallest (in physical size) tune, 
and goes for a chippy upbeat effort.. Good backbeat, and yet another 
foreground tune that nearly works.. Again, this person could end up in 
the ranks of regular Atari musicians if he is not too careful.. A close 
fight against Evil at 20 points.. This only needs a longer and more 
involved lead line to make it fully decent..

15 points went to Havoc who seemed to have a lot of 'Fun' making it! 
This was in contrast to Carbon's tiny tune, one of the more extravagant 
efforts in song size.. Also, the most sounding like an agitated ice 
hockey team trying to break out of a corrugated iron barn!

Spion was a worthy contender at 13 points.. His mid-table effort 
started off like a typical central European demo tune, but was really a 
bit too short and stumbling to make a lasting impression either way.

Ayeron's entry was the most bonkers of the lot, and probably won its 10 
points by sheer hard work on the part of its creator.. But then again, 
Dr Frankenstein probably had his supporters who valued 'hard work' as 
well, even after his  creation had run amok?? Some mad Dutch people get 
into this song.. This is the bulkiest tune of the lot, and accounted 
for a high proportion of the approx 1 meg download.. So send them your 
next phone bill then!

At last, the top three, with the first of the 'single pointers' (seven 
in all), I have to humbly take a bow, and proudly claim my third place! 
My effort managed to be contemporary to the time of year, as the only 
overtly Xmas song in there, and the only song to feature wicked Jody 
Smith comedy 'Dalek' samples.. It was a song that had been created 
before I had even got a Falcon, (apart from the Jody Smith contribution 
sort of tacked on later) and had been slung on the back burner for four 
or five years, but the sodding disk refused to melt!

Second place, squeezing in a mere three votes, is Blind-Io.. With 
something that sounded like it wanted to be somewhere else in a hurry..

But it is Marcer, who manages the awe-inspiring total of 'null points', 
if this is the Eurovision of the Atari music scene, he is its Norway! 
Marcer's entry sounds a bit like a 'first time out of the box' Quartet 
tune, but for some bizarre reason, it is the only really memorable one 
out of the whole lot and it has this good, or alternatively, deeply 
horrible quality of sticking in your brain for days on end!

 65% - A Zig-a-Zig Aargh!


 The Mystic Bytes Scene Music Compilation..

The very unzippily titled 'Scene Music Compilation' is probably the 
most ambitious 'pure' music compilation demo, and the one certainly 
offering a welcome diversity of talent, to show that there are many 
brilliant musicians out there in Atari Scene land..

Indeed, the talent pool has been scoured clean, with such musical 
luminaries as 505, MSG, MC Laser and Sh3, DMA SC, and the inevitable 
Toodeloo all included.. Also some previously unknown composers, such as 
Thomas of New Beat, are in here too..

The omens are good when the demo starts.. The presentation is easily 
the best of any recent music demo, and the best of any Mystic Bytes 
productions.. If their future demo work continues along these lines, I 
for one, will be more than happy! This relatively sophisticated 
interface uses fancy CD-style controls for such refinements as volume 
control, pause, stop, fast forward, etc.. 

The music reflects the wide range of talent called up to serve this 
compilation.. You start with the epic sounding opening tune 
'Alternative Power' from DMA SC.. The wide range of themes goes from 
Sh3's funky beat 'Aphro Let', to MC Lasers classic early/mid 90's demo 
tune 'Twilite Sleep', heavy on Jarresque wind/water swirls.. Along the 
way, we meet the dark and powerful movie soundtrack 'Warlock', from XTD 
of Mystic Bytes, ending up on MSG's evocative 'Who is Satoshi'.. This 
takes in a whole lot of other good music on the way..

This is another 'biggie', coming in around three megabytes, again, to 
reflect the fact of large amounts of internet around the place.. This 
is necessary to make as impressive a showcase for the music as 
possible, which is what it is all about!

 82% - This music sets the scene! 


 Chippin' for air 6..

Well this needs no further introduction, the one that Dead Hackers 
Society provide, turns more than enough stomachs as it is!

We skim as quickly as possible over the 'Toodeloo communion with the 
gods of the water-closet' intro (methinks that judging by the heavy 
sounding splashes and accompanying grunting sounds, Toodeloo needs a 
lot more fibre in his diet!) 

Another aspect of this strange little tableux strikes me, is that the 
famous back-to-front baseball cap is being worn yet again, even at this 
most intimate  of moments.. Which leads me on to a hastily written 
adaption of a 'Fast Show' sketch as imagined with Evil and Toodeloo 
playing it!

Evil:- "So it's the famous baseball cap again mate.."

Toodeloo:- "Yes, it's the famous baseball cap again alright!"
.
Evil:- "You do everything in that cap, don't you mate!"

Toodeloo:- "Yeah, that's right.."

Evil:- "Go to bed in it, you do!"

Toodeloo:- (Tiring fast of this conversation) "Sure..."

Evil:- (Loudly) "Even GO TO THE TOILET in it!!"

Toodeloo:- (Quietly) "I shagged your girlfriend wearing it..."

Evil:- "!?!?!"

The above conversation is thankfully fictional, and distracts somewwhat 
from the review..

The actual demo is a very tasteful hi-res affair, normal screen on VGA, 
interlaced on RGB, and is very nicely done.. The tunes are back to 
classic Toodeloo form, including some well-known standard bearers from 
the '80's such as Delta (Hubbard on C64!) and Alphaville 'Big in 
Japan', which is roughly dated to the 'Miama Vice' big shouldered white 
jacket era..

There is a bit of movement onscreen with the odd dot-scrolly/shape type 
effect, which fits in very well..The presentation is very smooth, and 
augers well for future DHS productions, I personally look forward to a 
big Falcon demo with that standard of presentation from them!
