Atari.Org Update 
Feb. 1999

Hello everyone,

It has been a busy few months for all involved, but Atari.Org still 
continues to grow from strength to strength.

ˆA brief overview 

For those that are either unaware or not connected to the Internet 
Atari.Org is a project started nearly 6 months ago. It's aim was to 
provide a free, unified resource for everyone and anyone involved with 
Atari computers (and consoles) on the Internet. It didn't matter if you 
were an ST programmer or a 2600 collector. If you were on the Internet 
we wanted you to be involved.

ˆServices

To this end we set about offering a few fundamental services, the most 
common being the free sub-domains. You can get your own sub-domain 
(you.atari.org) to point to your web site, so you no longer need to use 
the nasty addresses often provided by ISPs or free hosting companies.

We now also provide free email addresses. These can be in the form of 
forwarding addresses (i.e. all email sent to you@atari.org is 
automatically sent to your ISP or University account). Or they can be 
proper POP3 mailboxes with logins and passwords.

Both of these services are active and can be signed-up for on the 
atari.org website.

We have also been working on the web site itself though, Pathfinder - 
our Atari directory - now has nearly 800 links in it. Several new 
sections have been added (Portables - covering the Portfolio, ST Book 
etc) and MIDI. Other areas with a previously low amount of content (8-
bits, Falcon) have been pumped up.

All in all, Pathfinder is the single largest Atari directory on the 
Internet and we continue to update and maintain it. So if you have a 
web site that you know isn't listed - do yourself a favour!

Pathfinder will also soon be released as a bookmark file for CAB and 
Netscape. This means if you so desire, you can have the entire 
directory on your bookmarks list!

ˆNews

Due to a collaboration with DHS, X-Online, Back In Time and Jagu-Dome 
we have built up our own news service. This database driven news system 
carries all the Atari news from around the Internet as it's released. 
You can also search for specific topics, list news from the current or 
previous month and new features will be added shortly. We are currently 
looking for people to help add news to atari.org. It's all web 
interface driven and you'd get your own login and password. If you'd 
like to help out then get in touch please.

ˆCD-Roms

It was always our intension to make a CD-Rom once a quarter with all 
the Atari software that had been released during that time period. We 
didn't ever expect to fill an entire CD per quarter, but the contents 
would be enough to warrant being on a CD-Rom as opposed to disks.

CD's are also cheaper to copy! The end of March will see the first 
Atari.Org CD-Rom. It will contain all Atari software released since the 
1st Jan. 1999. This includes ST/STE/Falcon/Mint as well as Lynx, 
Jaguar, 2600 and 8-bit software. There will also be some famous 
archives (DHS Module Archive), emulators and music. As a special treat 
we hope to have 2 audio tracks on the first CD, one being a 30 minute 
"Back In Time" recording featuring interviews with famous Atari people, 
game music and more. The second an exclusive piece of music composed 
for Atari.Org.

We will be making the CD-Rom available as cheaply as possible (at 
present we expect it to sell for around 6 UK pounds) but the CD will 
also be public-domain. By that we mean we will encourage people to copy 
it and spread it around to their friends. Atari has long since stopped 
being a platform to make money from, we do all of this because we love 
the machines not the dollar (or pound, or mark, or franc).

ˆCompo!

We know everyone is extremely busy with their productions for Error In 
Line. However we'd like to start up a competition to design an 
Atari.Org intro. We will supply the graphics and text to you (just 
email rich@atari.org for them) and we have no idea what prize we will 
offer! But we'll think of something, probably some groovy atari.org t-
shirts. There are no limitations on the intro, ideally it'll work on 
STs and Falcons, but it could equally run on the 2600 or 8-bits or Lynx 
or Jag! So long as we can see it in action on an Atari machine that's 
all we care about.

If you think you could do something, email me and I'll gauge the 
response and think of a prize :-)

That's all for now. I know this has been a really short introduction 
but as everything is still "under development" it will probably stay 
that way for a few months yet. We will bring more and more areas online 
soon, it's not all going to happen in one big explosion of HTML, but 
gradually. I can however say - come and see us at Error In Line! or at 
the forthcoming Atari UK Show. We'll be there in full force and look 
forward to seeing you all.

Cheers,
