
...The (slightly reduced) Maggie Team...

It is proving a bit harder than usual to raise a laugh in this section, 
because of the departure of two longstanding members of the Maggie 
Team.. Not because of any 'creative differences' with us, I hasten to 
add, but perhaps because there has been a loss of inspiration, the 
reasons for which, were discussed in more detail elsewhere..

It is in this spirit, of laughing less than normal, that we say 
farewell to both Tat and Ed Cleveland.. You will be missed in here, and 
there will always be a place for you, should you choose to come back..

            Something like normal service now resumes .....

This time around, we see how the Maggie Team got on with a live action 
version of the Lunatic Asylum's new multiplayer game, 'Breakdance'..

CiH, The editor.. Excused himself from appearing by citing war-wounds 
substained in five World Wars, three of which no-one else had heard of, 
and none of which he was old enough to take part in!

Mr Pink, Deputy editor.. Was doing okay until he realised that he could 
only count in hexadecimal.. Then he lost the plot completely!

Ripley, She IS Miss Atari!

Jody Smith, General mad person.. Got his Boogaloo mates to stand in for 
him, they did rather well, but they were disqualified on an ASCII 
graphics technicality..

Sh3, Wall of inspirational noise person.. Got very drunk, no, very VERY 
drunk, started making exaggerated violent movements, and had to be 
restrained and carried off by Miss Atari's thickset 'minders'..

MSG, (See entry immediately above).. Got even drunker than Sh3, and 
ended up doing a pixel-perfect repetition of the most complex dance 
sequences during the ten minutes it took him to find his front door 
key!

Felice, Showbiz correspondent.. Thought 'breakdance' was something that 
you did with plates in a Greek restaurant!

Kev 'Taff' Davies, supercomputing correspondent.. Hit by a sharp plate 
fragment from Felice's abortive efforts.. Caught this in the thorax, 
and made a noise not unlike " uuuuuuu" until the paramedics arrived on 
the scene!


Also thanks to the following, in no particular order of thingy..

John Hayward, back fixing stuff again..

Steve Moore? What's keeping you?

Rich Davey, See you at EIL!

James Ingram, for stepping out of the shadows..

Dave Hollis, better off staying in the shadows?!

Baggio, Deez, Green, and the Viking for their combined assault on the 
Quast Party travel report!

Greetings and salutations to the following, also in no particular order 
of thingy..

back *soon* with Centurbo 2 please!
