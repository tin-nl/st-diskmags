CIH's VIEWPOINT:


We get down and dirty on an STFM of neolithic vintage, complete with a 
case that sort of wobbles off with a tired sigh, and sparks fly from 
the TV adaptor! Will we get to see the whole demo before this machine 
gives up completely, will there be both pictures and sound at the same 
time? Just what is going on with this 'revival' of the ST megademo 
anyway? 

Now read on....

No-one ever believed that this demo would be finished.. We've been 
waiting long enough, and it isn't as if there was a real big amount of 
news from the web pages over the past year (Leonard, thanks for the 
news you did give us though..)

With a lack of enthusiam killing the 'Resurrection' demo, all hopes for 
a decent 'blast from the past' project were firmly pinned on this 
production, and it was with some interest, that we started to hear 
tales around Xmas time, that this demo was finally nearing completion..

Well, give or take a few weeks, it is here now, was it worth the wait?

It took a bit of scratching around to find that old STFM, covered under 
all those layers of discarded magazines, a moment of initial panic when 
a black blank screen appeared on switching on, a momentary pause to 
reassure myself that is was due to a sad and bedraggled looking monitor 
cable which is nearly bent in two.. Only when I made the trip to Mr 
Pink's place, were we able to borrow a television lead to get a useful 
picture from this box..

Switching on produces a real 'Nostalgic-O' feeling, as an almost pixel-
perfect copy of the Union Demo loader screen kicks in!

Waving it away, a stunning Niko painted 'Oxygene' logo is displayed.. 
Wonder if that guy ever tried to realise his pixellated creations in a 
more solid medium like sculpture? The intro loads, and this is rather 
wonderful.. In common with another French bit of the demo, which we 
shall see a bit later, it is definitely one of the highlights..

Leonard has come up with an 'EKO'-like 3-D screen, an ace looking walk 
through of a futuristic cityscape.. This goes into vector line mode 
momentarily for a credits infoburst, then back to the solid 3-D main 
event, and is a neat way of kicking off proceedings.. From the 'info' 
screen in the demo, a little bit of sneakiness around a PC led to this 
cool screen..

There is a more modern loader for the main menu and the rest of the 
screens, a hyperactive 'dot-rave' loader/depacker..

The main menu is apparently the most impressive ever done on an ST.. 
The screen window is 448 x 256 pixels, and the rendered metallic 
'Charly' sprite is 64 x 80 pixels in size.. From his appearance, maybe 
he shouldn't be considered in the same warm and affectionate light as 
the Union Demo character, but more as a 'Terminator Charly'! I 
personally liked the main menu graphics and system, other people may 
differ on that?

There is a back-up text only main menu, which cuts down on the 
searching around part, clearly inspired by Delta Force's proclamation 
on the subject ("Thou shalt have a simple back-up system to the main 
graphically based menu, as it is a bugger trying to find your way to 
all the screens..")

Just a case of going to the nearest door, and going in..

The first screen is one to gladden the heart of any old-style ST coding 
purist who gave up on the scene when 'Design' started to make an 
appearance.. This is a dots demo.. Lots of them onscreen..In fact 6475 
of them! Followed by a screen of controllable sinus dots with 1250 
onscreen.. A real good old 'Beat dis' screen, as people used to say.. A 
nice little overscan screen with some textual credits brings this part 
of the show to a close..

The next screen we come across continues this seeming plummet back in 
time, with the 'tradition' screen, by the Bad Brew Crew.. Crazy 
thoughts of that long hot summer of 1990, Sammy Joe, armpit farting 
noise competitions between the different members of the Lost Boys, and 
much more from that strange period, all come lurching back!

Onscreen, we get a big sprite, and parallax background, with some nice 
floaty BBC style chip music.. It's as if the last nine years since the 
Mindbomb demo never happened!

Another one from T.O.Y.S. attempts to bring the story up to date by a 
few years, with a central window concentrating on rotating and zooming 
chunky pixels, and a whole bunch of oldish looking graphics surrounding 
it..

In the rough order we looked at the demo, Leonard's fractal engine is 
up next for consideration.. This was clearly inspired by BMT's 'Cray II 
emulator', but, of course, is just that little bit quicker!

A witty screen by the 'Atari Boys' is next.. This takes a slightly 
subversive look at the convention of the gradually building, 'This 
looks boring, but wait to see what comes next' chunky scroller.. The 
scroller mutates into several different shades of puke-making panic, 
the background develops some strange textures, going into ULM demo 
territory at one stage.. The most interesting bits of the text, ie. How 
to make the effect, are very difficult to distinguish from the 
background, and blur in and out of it..

You need sunglasses, with anti-solar eclipse polaroid filters, to read 
this sucker!

The climax of this bit, is when the dots of the background textures, 
mutate into hundreds of tiny little Lemmings, who wave about for a bit, 
then nuke themselves down off the screen!

The next door opens to the other major highlight of the demo, the 
Overlanders 3-D Texture screen!

It is a proven fact, from ST demo history, that when the Overlanders 
'guest-star' on another crews production, they are really launching a 
takeover bid for it! Consider the Pendragons megademo, the three most 
memorable screens were all OVR productions.. What about the European 
demos, frankly a lot of middle ranking screens, a certain amount of 
dross to fill the corners, but the three or four really good screens in 
there, again, mainly by the Overlanders!

Fortunately, this demo proves to be no exception, with this truly 
excellent (and stuffed to the gills) production!

This starts off with a simple textured cube, which rotates around to 
show several different graphics on each face.. The odd character from 
South Park gets in there.. After a time, a flame-plasma 'dissolve' 
effect banishes the cube, and the next object comes onto the screen.. 
This is a starfighter, which flies around for a while, before being 
succeeded by a slightly blocky 'Kryten' style textured head..

A shiny golden star flaunts itself on the screen, making the best use 
of the sixteen available colours, a 'Lucky Strike' cigarette packet.. 
(This provoked a grumble from Mr Pink that he was going to do this!) 
They go so far as to spin a house around..

All objects are also lightsourced too.. Just then, OVR turn up the demo 
effect temperature dial up a notch..

The cube seen at the beginning is back, but with rotating and zooming 
textures, (see our 'Syntax' review in this issue for a description of a 
very similar effect.) An ironic version of the head, a skull, complete 
with bulging eyeballs.. A bit of environment mapped wizardry is next, 
with a blue 'morphing' saphhire, and a face that is all over the 
place..

The best really is saved to last, as an animated 'Kenny' object (from 
TV's 'South Park') waves to the crowd as various credits and greeting 
fly over the top of the screen.. Being Kenny, we all know what happens 
to him in (nearly) every episode, and sure enough, it does!

He explodes, with the now famous refrain "Omigod, he killed Kenny!" 
ringing out from the telly speakers.. Well nearly, as "Omigod, this 
killed my ST too!" We find that out the hard way, that this old 'FM is 
implacably hostile to playing samples, and we have to reboot..

The sound from this machine wasn't the same for a long time after that 
either..

Still, probably the best part of the demo, and not one that you're 
going to forget in a hurry either..

Anything after that is a bit of an anti-climax, so I would repeat this 
useful advice to any aspiring ST demo coders, *never* appear in 
anything that has got the Overlanders on the same billing.. Your own 
work will suffer with the comparison!

In this spirit, we get to look at a smart 'clone' of an old Amiga 
(Phenomena) screen, also seen previously on the ST.. This is another 
cube, with moving objects on the surfaces, much simpler than the 
preceding screens, and somewhat dated in comparison.. This is Martin 
Griffiths (Inner Circle) contribution.. To be fair, it never pretended 
to be anything but an old screen..

Another guest screen by Cream next, a simple (Agent T) designed SID-
player screen, playing a selection of the original Commodore 64 SID 
music from the Union Demo.. Familiar to SID fanatics like me, but a 
pleasant surprise to a lot of people who might not have expected this 
sort of thing on a bog-standard STFM..

The next screen is one I really wish I hadn't gone into.. Describing 
itself as a 'Joke' screen, it is a straightforward copy/conversion of 
the TCB Cuddly Demo 'Big scroller and sample' screen.. This had the 
unfortunate consequence of killing off my ST's sound for good.. (At 
least for the remainder of this reviewing session..)

'Sprite Blast' is another screen in the spirit of the first 'dot demo' 
part.. An average looker, but one which was one of the authors 
favourites, being more technically interesting to old time coders.. You 
get a huge sprite and even huger text as it is..

Minor screens..

There is a very useful 'info' screen, which really needs a mouse 
connected.. It has a HTML-style interface, and was very useful to me in 
giving the precise information for parts of this review (heights in 
pixels etc..)

There is also a nice little disk-copy screen, where you can clone 
copies of this demo, in the style of the Union Demo copy screen.. Lots 
of LED-style graphics, indicator bars flying around the place for the 
no doubt interesting sound that we couldn't hear by that time..

Reset screen..

Easiest to reach from the secondary text menu for some reason.. Seemed 
to hang when actually pressing the reset button?

This is a smallish screen, and is a neat twist on the 3-D cube idea, as 
when it gets up close, it is revealed to be made up of hundreds of 
little vector balls (726 in all!)

These then twist about a central axis forever, or at least until you 
switch the rapidly overheating ST off..

-----v-----

In conclusion, we got through the experience (nearly) unscathed, and 
enjoed it hugely.. The first real 'megademo' for the ST in many years, 
the first 'menu' system based demo since Mrs Thatch was kicked into 
touch.. Not quite the first reset demo in a long time, as Cream managed 
to beat them to that, and remain thoroughly modern at the same time..

The demo seemed to split into two distinct ways of approaching its 
subject.. Some parts, notably Leonard's awesome 3-D intro, and the 
Overlanders sublime textured objects, brought the ST bang up to date in 
demo scene terms.. The effects and presentation not out of place on a 
Falcon.. Other parts went for a self-conscious 'Old school' approach 
(Urg, it's that phrase again!) evoking memories of the golden age of 
the old ST scene c.1988-1991..

Some people may pick and choose which bits they preferred, but the 
overall quality, which is the important thing, was very high 
throughout..

Nostalgic-o? Yes, maybe, but with an eye to the future as well!

Ratings..

I'm not really going to try to rate this in a normal sense, as parts of 
this are very old, and would compare poorly with the more 'modern' 
parts of the demo, if a cold, objective reviewing system was used..

It is sufficient to say, it is wonderful, and the best possible 
advertisment for continuing life on the ST in demo terms..

I would have liked it to run on the Falcy, but still, never mind.. 
Maybe someone can have a poke around my old 'FM to get it back to full 
working order, and this demo may well be starring at the Stafford Atari 
Computing Convention in Spring..

( ( ( Nostalgia-O demo ) )  )
  ( (    by Oxygene    ) )

      Explored by
         Richard Davey
      (rich@atari.org)
ˆ
Demo reviews in the past have often been treated in the same manner 
that you might review a game. Ratings based on graphics, music and 
design. But demos are a strictly personal experience, some that move 
you might not do anything for others. What you consider a rather passe 
effect, someone else might stare at in awe and wonder.

It is this uniqueness that defines a demo, that gives it its soul.

Leonards Nostalgia-O- demo has that soul in abundance. It takes you 
somewhere back into the depths of time, when mega demos roamed the 
earth, scrollers slid endlessly by and your status was half defined by 
the amount of "greetings" lists you appeared in.

Some parts of this demo are several years old, some parts of it are 
very new but look several years old! But that is partly the aim behind 
it anyway. Leonard set out to create a classic ST megademo, to break 
some world records and to get guest screens from others in the scene.

After downloading the demo and creating the boot disk, you sit back and 
watch. The opening screen is a classic conversion of the Union demo 
intro, a nice touch indeed. Everything fades to black, the music kicks 
in and the words appear.. "You all think it was a joke". Well, we have 
all known Leonard has been working on this project for some time now, 
lots of people even doubted it would ever be released. Thankfully he 
proved all the skeptics wrong. The fading text leads into a stunning 3D 
world. You fly backwards through a tunnel system, into various rooms, 
outside past buildings, into a space port and around little ships. It's 
colourful, filled vectors. When the credits overlay ontop of the 3D it 
turns into wireframe for a moment. This section in itself looks really 
cool indeed and the TAO music completes a really awesome screen.

Moving on you get to see the loader screen, the first thing you notice 
is that the demo is depacking the data as it's loading. The second 
thing you notice is just how damn fast the data is actually loading! 
This loading system prevails throughout the entire demo and makes what 
could by all rights have been a really tedious part, rather 
entertaining.

The main menu is a full-screen multi directional scroller. You get to 
move this little 3D robot (let's call him Charley!) around with the 
arrow keys. The robot is a huge animated sprite, 64x85 pixels. The 
whole thing is totally fullscreen and fills up every last remaining 
edge of your monitor! It's fluid and scrolls around flawlessly. The 
standard "doors" lead to various screens. Or you can cheat and press 
UNDO to reach a text menu version instead (but don't be so boring!)

The screens in order are as follows:

ˆDots Revenge (Leonard) 

It opens with a really nice Mon picture, it's just a shame it's only in 
black and white. Some might consider this stylish, but to me it makes 
it seem as if it was an image converted from a better resolution and 
colour depth. Eitherway, it's a good picture for sure. Following it are 
no less than 6475 dots. You probably couldn't count them all anyway, 
but Leonard assures us they are there. You get to see a purple screen 
with a load of white dots blasting around the place. They move rather 
gracefully and you get to control them with the Function keys. TAO 
provides a much needed audio trip with it. If it wasn't for the fun you 
can have making your own dot patterns you'll probably leave this screen 
within a few seconds.

ˆSprites Parallax (BBC) 

The Law and Xerud from the BBC slap a giant sprite onto a vivid 
parallax background and shift the whole thing around at quite some 
rate. This has to be the oldest looking screen in the demo but it's a 
brief slice of fun none-the-less. Probably the most interesting part of 
it is to realise that in the "old" days the two effects (big sprite and 
parallax background) would have made screens in their own right!

ˆFractal Blast (Leonard) 

What can we say? It's fractals. Lots of them. Very colourful, very 
large (320x256) and VERY fast indeed. The standard classic mandelbrot 
taking only 2.6 seconds to calculate and display. Easily the fastest 
Fractal routine on the ST ever. Plus they look really great!

ˆLemmings Colourshock (Atari Boys) 

Personally I thought this screen was great. A real trip down memory 
lane. It starts with a large but plain scroller which proclaims the 
classic "lets add some rasters". You know the score already, bit by bit 
the Atari Boys build up the screen. Adding rasters, music, more 
rasters, bouncing rasters, balls, led scroller and finally hundreds of 
little walking lemmings (which they then proceed to nuke). It's a very 
"old style" screen and for that I love it. Remember this Nostaliga demo 
is meant to be just that. What's more is it's in full screen too. Space 
bar takes you to a plain fullscreen hardware scroller that features a 
classic Amiga font in the style of a biscuit! Rather dull after such a 
nice colourful screen.

ˆSIDCOM (Cream) 

This screen is plain, just a logo and a "typewriter" text effect. But 
that's not why you'll spend ages on it - TAO presents you with all of 
the classic tunes used in the Union demo (and in turn converted from 
the C64). He's converted the lot and all 10 tunes are superb and bring 
back fond old memories. Ikari Union, Alloy Run, Ninja Remix et all are 
here in glorious SID format. Listen and love.
ˆ
Guest Joke Screen (TCB!) 

You'll know the screen the moment you see it - the huge bouncing white 
scroller on a distorting blue background with that short but thumping 
"bass" sample. So it's a joke screen (in that TCB didn't actually 
submit it for this demo) but whattaheck!

ˆSprite and Megascroller Blast (Leonard) 

Some well drawn balls (borrowed from the Decade demo) wave around the 
screen to a digi music tune. Then from out of nowhere a massive scroll 
text blasts past. It's a greatly resized Knighthawks font with a raster 
coloured middle. That's about it really - oh, and it's full screen! The 
best part is the quote "Oxygene needs no custom chips to display 
balls!"

ˆ3D Cube (Griff - Inner Circle) 

This is a conversion of a part of Phenomenas classic Enigma demo on the 
Amiga. Maybe Griff had had ideas to convert the whole demo at some 
point? Who knows, it's a shame he never did but this section of it is 
good enough. A small blue square with a star field in it, the square 
turns - you realise its a cube and there are different effects on each 
face. It's smooth, not particularly colourful, is missing the great 
soundtracker tune that was on the original but is a good testament to 
Griffs programming prowess. Sadly though it's very short indeed, the 
screen ending after what seems like only a few seconds.

ˆ3D Mapping (Ben - Overlanders) 

The Overlanders! Yeah! My God they always had style. All those Triton 
Design graphics and logos, the great scrolling menus, the manic 3D 
screens and giant scrollers. Ahhh.. nostalgia! However for this 
contribution they concentrate on one somewhat newer effect - namely 
texture mapping onto 3D objects. However this is pulled off really 
quite well, the objects vary from skulls and faces to paper aeroplanes 
to stars and South Park characters! It's smooth, it actually looks 
quite good considering the limitations and the ending part is brilliant 
(I'll not spoil it for you - just go see it). Most notable of all 
though has to be the soundtrack from Jess. This is easily the best tune 
in the entire Nostalgia-O- demo. Great stuff!

ˆFullscreen Rotozoomer (Toys)

Peylow kicks back and blasts forth some seriously fast effects. 
Colourful twisting backgrounds, multiple vertical scrollers, big 
logos, sprites zipping about and a massive rotozoomer! It's like he 
took 6 of his favourite effects from demos across the years and glued 
them all together into this one (no bordered!) screen. More.. please!

ˆLED Copy Screen (Leonard) 

What true megademo would be complete without a built-in copy system? 
Obviously not this one. Leonard has gone LED scroller mad and this 
screen will actually copy the demo for you too, what a bargain. I'm 
also happy to see some VU meters in the screen! No megademo should be 
complete without VU meters (sorry evil!)
ˆ
Credits Screen (Leonard) 

Very cleverly this screen uses an HTML style interface. Various words 
lead onto other screens, all laid out cleanly. There is a mass of 
information here, full credits, greetings and the technical details 
behind the demo. Leonard explains how he coded various screens, how the 
disk reading system was created and you end up feeling really rather 
humbled. There is so much work going on behind this demo that you don't 
get to see "visually" it makes you realise why it took so long to 
complete. In todays world of hard disk loading demos, they don't have 
to worry about half the things you need worry about when running from a 
floppy disk. You can dig deep into the credits system and find those 
who supported the whole thing, kudos to you all.

ˆReset Screen! (Leonard) 

It had to be done. What megademo is complete without one? Hit that 
reset switch and you'll get this screen no matter where in the demo you 
are. It's a TAO chip tune (and therefore bloody great) and 726 4x4 
pixel balls. The balls spin and rotate on a 3 axis world. The entire 
demo is only 3.5k in size, that's optimisation for you! It looks damned 
good too.

Nostalgia-O- is a really nice change from the current trend of "a music 
disk with a couple of nice effects" that's doing the rounds at the 
moment. You actually feel like you get value for your money with this 
demo. There are loads of screens, not one of them isn't worth watching, 
plenty of new music, some nice graphics and some real world record 
breaking screens. It may be a little too technical and less design than 
some people would like, but I think for anyone who has their grass 
roots planted firmly in the raster-distorted world of mega demos from 
the mid to late 80's, this demo will awaken some old feelings for sure. 
Leonard - thank you. Everyone else who contributed to this demo - thank 
you. You've made this reviewer a very happy guy indeed.

Peace.
