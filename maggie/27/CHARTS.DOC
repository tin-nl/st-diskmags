                          THE MAGGIE CHARTS

Ever since the dawn of  time,  man  has  always  wanted to know who is
best. Who has the best rock? Who  has  the best cave? Who own the best
ox? The lushest field?  The  cleanest  stream?  Men have been obsessed
with top 10 lists - always a popular topic of pub conversation.

And women have turned up their noses  at this tendency in men. "Why do
you have to always compare yourself  against  other people? Why do you
need to know what is best?  It's  totally  stupid! Do you think my bum
looks bigger than hers?"

As the century draws to  an  end,  the  maggie statisticians have been
beavering away in their dark cave to  produce the lists of the best in
Atari. They have received stone tablets with votes carved in them from
many distant lands. Using  only  the  most  primitive tools (A Falcon)
they have compiled this set of charts.

Avena's "Sonolumineszenz" is still the king of the Falcon demos, which
makes Tat's recent departure all  the  more disappointing. The preview
screens of his "Binliner" demo amassed  enough  points to make the top
10! With the source  code  and  utilities  available  on his web page,
maybe someone will complete this project.

The top 6 remains relatively stationary with the new Mystic Bytes demo
"Teardrop" busting in at number 5. There  are other new entries in the
top 10 for the  other  Quast  demos,  Escape's  "Illness  At Night And
Shackled Sheep" and the Fun/Inter colloboration "Fungle Beats".

Lower down the charts, the  unfinished  "Motion"  debuts at number 16.
Assemsoft and DHS's revolutionary  "GEMDemo"  storms  in at number 19,
whilst another DHS effort, "Conflict", fights its way into the top 23.

Bizarrely, the Lost Donut demo  has  been  found  again. When we asked
Griff to comment on this  new  burst  of  criticial admiration for his
ancient  intro  he  responded  by  rolling  around  on  the  floor  in
hysterics.


CASUALTIES:

The release of The Mystic  Bytes  "Teardrop"  demo has severely dented
the "Any Colour You Like" fan  base,  with the shadows demo plummeting
down the charts from number 5 to number 15.

Avena and Digital Chaos's  brilliant  untitled  Fried  Bits 3 demo has
crashed once too often and this  time  crashed right out of the charts
from its top 10 position of last issue.

Other notable casualties are  "Autowaschen Verboten", "X-Perience" and
"Papa Was A Bladerunner".

PREDICTIONS:

Its been a quiet year for  Falcon  mega-demos so far with only Cobra's
"Generation Gap" making a showing, although this failed to chart. Most
people are saving up their  effects  for  the demo parties, and expect
EIL 99 to produce some more  great Falcon demos. Whether anything will
be able to challenge to  quartet  of  Sono,  Dream Dim, Lost Blubb and
Eko-System is another matter.

A new category with some old  faces  and a surprising winner. There is
no doubting the genius of Aggression, but  a  lot of ST voters seem to
favour the really "old school"  demos  and  for "Brain Damage" to beat
the likes of the Union and Cuddly demos is no mean feat.

Oxygene's great new demo "Nostalgico"  makes a hugely impressive entry
at number 4, great  going  considering  it  was  released just 2 weeks
before these charts  were  completed  and  we  already  had  a  lot of
votesheets.

Cream also make a strong debut with "Do Things" at number 10.

Syntax should consider  themselves  unlucky,  "Sometimes The Bumblebee
Flies Higher Than The Falcon"  flew  high  for  some time, leading the
charts for a number of weeks.  Personally  I think it is pretty boring
to see demos like the "Union  Demo"  and  "Cuddly Demos" so high up in
the charts - yes, we know they  are  great, but they are old and there
is newer and better stuff about. Move on please gentelemen!

Nice to see a bit of  movement  in this charts, although still nothing
looks  like  challenginge  "Terrorise   Your  Soul".  Syntax's  superb
"Sometimes.." takes on the Falcon  96kers  and  beats  a whole load of
them, flying into the charts at number 3.

CASUALTIES:

"Six Sievert" by .tscc.  tumbles  down  the  charts  to  number 8, and
unfortunately the chances of this  crew  making  to make another 96ker
are close to zero. Crour's 96ktro from the Symposium 96 was in the top
10 last time, this time it is nowhere.

PREDICTIONS:

It will be interesting to see if  Syntax  can  hold on to the number 3
spot in this Falcon dominated category.  With Error In Line coming up,
expect to see a rash of 96ktros bidding for chart position.

We have a brand new number  one!  Well  not that new, 4mention charted
last issue but polled less than half of the votes of 4ever. Last issue
I wrote of my surprise about 4ever beating 4mention, but the situation
has now been rectified.

DHS prove that they are 4king brilliant at writing 4096 byte intros by
taking the top three places. 4orce, the first 4ktro with music, forces
its way into second position only  1  point behind 4mention with 4ever
slipping down to third.

New Beat have a  strongly  placed  new  entry  with  "Flu" going in at
number 3 and the Mystic Bytes must  be,  erm, Fury-ous to see their 4k
just miss out on the top 5.

Mind Design promised used a  4ever  beating  intro, but "4some" didn't
really cut the mustard and just squeezes into the top 10.

CASUALTIES:

There is a lot of movement  in  this  charts  and "Fury" has split the
mystic bytes votes causing  "Surprise"  to  tumble  from  the number 2
position of last issue.

Laser and Inter's "Gurkensalat" stumbles down from 5 to 17.

God must be angry with the Spirites  as  their demo falls from the top
10 down to joint 20th, tying with the made up protest-against-crap-4k-
demo-names "4Skin". Forgiveness may  be  a  great  thing, but we can't
forgive them for that  horrendously  embarassing text that accompanied
their great effects.

PREDICTIONS:

Although their is nothing on  the  cards  at  the  moment, by the next
issue of maggie expect DHS to  have  rumbled up yet another 4ktro. And
it will probably be brilliant again.

Error In Line should see the release of some more 4ktros and hopefully
someone will take on the DHS monopoly of this category!

Checkpoint's  astounding   "Hunt4fji"   completely   annihilates   the
opposition in this category, and deservedly  so. It was enough to make
other 128 byte coders give up. ( Yes! Please Do! -The General Public).

The first 128 byte  game  "Hong  Tron  Phooey"  is placed second, with

sunquake a somewhat  surprising  third.  DHS's  original  128 byter is
fourth with checkpoint's "Staars" and "Cider with RG" tying for fifth.

CASUALTIES:

This is a new category,  but  where  are  all the NoCrew entries? Fair
enough "Pong 128" picked  up  some  votes  but  everyone seems to have
forgotten about their "Power Morphing Sierpinski Triangle" and fractal
zoomer.

PREDICTIONS:

Just as you thought it was safe  to  go  to a demo party... RG have "a
number" of 128 byte intros ready for  release at EIL 99. There is also
the T.O.Y.S. 128 byter that  has  been  in development for years, that
DHS tunnel effect and  no  doubt  defjam  has  some  more magic up his
sleeves.

Can the Senior Dads's classic "Air Dirt" ever be beaten? It is looking
unlikely with even the  dads  unable  to  top themselves. (Just unplug
their pacemakers! - ED)

"Changer" hangs onto second place, but  is  forced  to share it with a
new entry from Greenland's finest fake  demo crew, Da Boosters. IPIR's
is an unwelcome new entry at number 4.

"5 lessons", "Ribbit" and "Anal Tuck"  hang  around  the top 10 like a
bad smell.

Even though we have had a similar  amount of votes to last issue, they
have been spread out over a  larger  number  of demos. Most of these I
have had the pleasure to avoid.

CASUALTIES:

The Senior Dads' "Xmas Card" has been  lost in the post and falls from
last issues number 7  into  oblivion.  We  have  also  said Goodbye to
"Goodbye" from DHS, the infamous "scene quitting gag" from last april.
Rasero teams "senior fuck out" have also fucked off.

The critically panned "Monomental" slumps down  to 24th. Will the dads
be able to recover?

PREDICTIONS:

Crews will take a perverse  delight  in  annoying  fake demo haters by
creating worse and worse intros. New standards for awful spelling will
be set. Some demos may even feature bits from old tv shows.

Unfortunately there is not much going on  in the world of Falcon Games
with the highest new entry being  "Bunion Canyon". Elsewhere we have a
number of re-entries and things have shuffled around a little, but the
top 4 look pretty secure.

Running literally runs  away  with  this  category  with RDTs finished
product  impressing  everyone  hugely.  The  unfinished  Willie  still
manages to take second with the now completed Crown Of Creation moving
up into third. Golden oldie "Double Bobble 2000" is a healthy fourth.

CASUALTIES:

Skyfall falls down the charts from 6th to  19th - there are so many RG
games to choose from they can't all be in the top 10!

Corsair came in at 10 last issue and has already slipped 8 places.

People have  seemed  to  have  realised  that  tscc's  Dynabusters  is
actually an ST game and voted for it in the right category this time.

We also say goodbye to shooters "Raiden" and "Panium Disaster".

PREDICTIONS:

Reeking Rubber is really hotting  up  with  the  addition of a network
play option and lots of  nice  extra  graphical effects. If nature can
complete this by next issue, expect it to race up the charts.

If New Beat manage to complete  Willies... what's that, "Atari To Make
New Computer  That  Outperforms  PlayStation  2  and  is  predicted to
outsell the PC 10 to  1?".  Both  events  seem  equally likely at this
point in time!

        84 ( - ) THE TRACE                       LOUD! [   1 ]

This is the most boring and  tedious  category to compile! This is the
most popular category with voters! And you all like different things!

The top  10  has  remained  quite  stagnant  with  UDS's  pinball game
"obsession" once again snatching the top  prize from "Wings Of Death".
The big surprise here  is  Dungeon  Master's  race  up the charts from
number 28 to number  3.  Have  you  lot  just  discovered this game or
something?

On the new games  front,  Kev  Callahan's  unfinished Bombaman makes a
promising debut at 17. Elsewhere  another  bomberman clone, Mr Boomer,
bursts into the charts  alongside  Loud's  tron  clone,  The Trace, at
joint 84th.

CASUALTIES:

Stone Age dropped like a stone from  8th  to 34th. Lots of other games
disappeared but they were all old anyway so who cares?

PREDICTIONS:

I will have to continue spending many hours compiling this category of
the chart. And I will love every minute of it.

When teenage finally release Crackman, expect  it to go top 20. Sector
One are working on a humorous  game entitled "Pie Bill Gates". Whether
it can take on Wings Of Death remains to be seen.

Bunion Canyon helps to keep the  Gods  of  game making at the top with
RDT leapfrogging over  New  Beat  following  the  release  of running.

Another one-game-wonder, Rebelsoft, stays happily in fourth with ishar
makers Silmarils completing the top 5.

Nature slip a place to fifth,  as  Reeking  Rubber is not yet complete
they have no proven track record. (That's terrible! You're hired -ED)

Elsewhere there are comedy votes for ID Software following the various
doom and quake ports  to  the  falcon.  Logotron's  games may be sheer
agony to play but they still make the top 10.

Another comment to pre-empt a shedload of angry mail, just who or what
are "universe"? Complaints to the usual address.

CASUALTIES:

My question of last  issue  of  "what  falcon  games do stosser make?"
provoked an angry response  from  the  stosser guys. Unfortunately the
voters seem to also have forgotten  what falcon games stosser make and
they have fallen out of the charts.

PREDICTIONS:

With both RDT and Rebelsoft having "shot their load" it is hard to see
them picking up many more votes,  yet  if  New Beat bring their Willie
out they may be able to mount  a  challenge  on the top spot. And lets
not discount Nature, they have  been  making  some key enhancements to
Reeking Rubber and once these driver roars  out expect them to roar up
the charts.

The ex-demo coders of Thalion  are  once  again your favourite ST game
makers followed by the hype machine  that was the bitmap brothers. UDS
come in at a respectable third  with  boy wonders Ed Cleveland and Kev
Callahan dashing up the charts to fourth.

Elsewhere it is nice  to  see  my  employers  US  Gold holding off the
fierce competition from that multinational corporation, Dave Munsie.

CASUALTIES:

The assembly line has reached the  end  of  the line and fallen out of
the top 10 and out of  the  charts.  Lara Croft creators Core has also
been cast aside, probably for not  porting their 'brilliant' series to
the ST.

PREDICTIONS:

When Teenage release Crackman expect  them  to  make an assualt on the
top 10. Kev Callahan  could  also  consolidate  his  position with the
release of bomber man. And there are some frenchies also working on ST
games, e.g. Adrenaline and Popsy Team.

A top 5 that's going  nowhere  (like  the  jag!  -  Comedy Ed). If you
haven't got these games then you  don't  deserve  to  own a jag! It is
interesting to see that Rayman  is  currently  riding  high in the PSX
charts - just shows how ahead of its time the jag was.

And what joker voted for Trevor McFur?

CASUALTIES:

Atari! (ho ho!) Apart from  that,  Missile  Command 3D has disappeared
from our sights along with kasumi ninja, zero 5, cannon fodder, defcon
and ultra vortek.

PREDICTIONS:

If 4play  can  ever  manage  to  get  around  hasbro's  obstacles then
battlesphere could climb  some  places.  Also  if  telegames manage to
secure the rights to SkyHammer expect to  see it enter the charts next
time.

The graphically stunning "Shadow Of The Beast" takes the top spot with
california games surfing into second.  Blue lightning takes a nosedive
into third and Lemmings, Xenophobe and Klax shuffle around a bit.

Good to see some relatively new stuff here with T-Tris coming in at 7.

Who voted for Batman? It's an awful game!
Likewise the voter who enjoyed playing  sonic the hedgehog on the lynx
should really cut down his drug intake.

CASUALTIES:

Checkered Flag pulled in for  a  pitstop  and  came out at 17th whilst
Gates And Zendecon and Electrocop never bothered coming back.

PREDCITIONS:

There are still people working  on  Lynx  games, primarily Carl Forhan
who has a couple of  titles  in  development.  If you crazy people can
tear yourself away from Shadow of the beast and california games for a
couple of seconds you may find something else you like.

Steven Tat-ersall snatches the top prize and is then kidnapped by Sony
who are holding him hostage  in  Cambridge,  forcing him to write code
for their little known  "PlayStation"  system,  offering him only huge
financial rewards in return. A crack  team  of the most highly trained
atari agents (Felice and that  big  bloke  who  wears  a kilt at atari
shows) have been sent to liberate  the  Tatster from the evil clutches
of Sony. Unfortunately they are currently lost somewhere near Taunton.

"Am I Evil?" asked Metallica in one  of their 'songs'. The answer was,
'are you large and swedish  and  do  you  write  falcon demos and rant
about MiNT?'. Metallica decided that  perhaps  they weren't so evil as
they first though.

Another PlayStation  codeslave  tumbles  into  third  position closely
followed by Poland's answer to  Alan Titchmarch, Sqward. Anonymity may
be his middle name  (a  very  popular  choice  of swedish parents) but
enough people are aware of the enigma that is Gizmo to propel him into
the top five.

Douglas Little may have disappeard  off  the  face of the planet (he's
probably living in Scotland) but  his  presence  is  still felt in the
charts, moving up to number 6.

'Flu','Fungle Beats' and 'Illness At Night' help send Thomas, Earx and
No up the chart into the top  10.  The activities of the reformed Mind
Design give Deez the highest new entry at number 11.

The biggest shock comes with Ripley's  surprise entry into the charts.
Up until now most people had been unaware of her coding abilities, but
she can now exclusively reveal to  Maggie  that she "once type in some
HTML". Stunning!

CASUALTIES:

EKO's lack of actitivity for the last few years is taking its tool and
Maxx-Out slips from 5th to 13th.  Unlucky  for some! But the situation
is even worse for the ill-fated tscc, with Dynacore falling completely
out of the charts from last issue's 6th place.

They have been countless rumours about  his return to the atari scene,
but he will have  to  hurry  up  as  people  are  forgetting about the
abilities of Yonek from Shadows who falls to 21st this time.

The release of Motion  hasn't  seemed  to  have  helped  Wiztom and he
slides out of the top ten  and  is  now  teetering  on the edge of the
charts, just holding on with one claw.

PREDICTIONS:

The Viking could join  fellow  Mind-Designer  in  the charts next time
with a decent EIL intro.  Hencox  is  already climbing the charts, and
should get even more votes when people see the new Reeking Rubber with
all its extra features.

Art/TBL certainly deserves to be featured here, and perhaps if he gets
his demo finished we may see an  entry  from him. Candyman of Cream is
buying a Falcon, and should he  turn  out anything of the same quality
as 'Do Things' expect him to rocket into the charts.

Just as he confirms his place  as  best  ST coder, it looks like Llama
from tscc is leaving the scene.  This  could  give a chance for second
place Yoyo, fresh from completing the brainblasting "Sometimes...", to
take the top spot. Defjam  for  Checkpoint  moves  up to fourth and is
poised to pounce on the top spot.

A promising fifth place for  Leonard  of  Oxygene  who has stunned the
atari world with the release  of  'Nostalgico'  -  the first decent ST
mega demo in years.

The impressive 'Do  Things'  gives  CandyMan  the  highest  new entry,
straight into the top 10, whilst Ben  of the Overlanders has picked up
a load of votes for his 3D-Mapping screen in Nostalgico and flies into
number 11.

CASUALTIES:

Xenit of Aggression is the  highest  placed  of last issue's coders to
drop out of the charts. Elswehere things have remained pretty static.

PREDICTIONS:

Following their recent demos, Candyman and  Leonard and all the others
involved in Nostalgico should continue to  get healthy scores. DHS are
planning an ST demo for EIL  so  we  could see Gizmo and Evil climbing
the charts. Peylow of TOYS and Drizzt of TNB could also do well.

The top ten spots are up for  grabs.  Manikin and Nic are hardly going
to come out with a hot new ST demo, Sqward is now more of Falcon coder
and Llama,  Tat and  Dynacore  have  departed.  The  way  is clear for
DefJam to callenge Yoyo for the top spot with a strong EIL demo.

DHS once again take the  top  spot  in  this  category, with a greatly
increased lead since last  issue.  Given  their  prolofic nature it is
going to hard to challenge  them  -  they certainly have an unbeatable
arsenal of 4ktros. However,  they  could  do  with a really impressive
Falcon megademo to ensure they keep  this lead. Dream Dimension hasn't
aged as well as some of the classic Falcon demos - perhaps because the
effects in it have been reused so many times. If they want to keep the
mystic bytes at bay, they are  going  to  need  to start doing some 3D
stuff.

Avena may be second, but their points  total has halved and the mystic
bytes have almost doubled  their  total.  Releases  like 'TimeOut' and
'TearDrop' are pushing Sqward's forces to the top.

Escape are another  gainer,  everyone  loved  'Illness  At Night'. And
despite all the protestations, some people seem to like 128 byte demos
and have reward RG for these tiny creations.

Good to see New Beat rising up the charts too.

CASUALTIES:

EKO slip down from third to sixth,  and it is ground they are unlikely
to recover. Lazer  are  similar  victimes,  blazing  down  to seventh.
Another old school casualty are TSCC  who have fallen to tenth.

The biggest casualty are the  shadows  who  are becoming the forgotten
crew of the Polish scene as everyone switches allegiance to the mystic
bytes.  Last  issue  they  were  ninth,  this  issue  they  have  been
forgotten. Any Colour You Like? How about invisible.

Therapy's  switch  to  Serious  Software   hasn't  helped  their  demo
credentials either.

PREDICTONS:

DHS's position looks  pretty  unbeatable,  but  as  they are currently
working on an ST demo  this  will  give  the competition the chance to
keep up. Mystic Bytes are  improving  with  every release and a strong
EIL demo could see them mounting a serious challenge on the Swedes.

Golden oldies TCB win  again  (isn't  it  time  you  ST fans voted for
someone else?) which is a bit of  a shame for second placed Syntax who
had actually led the chart all the way up until the last vote had been
received.

Checkpoint are a healthy third and 'Do  Things' has pushed Cream up to
seventh. TOYS's nostalgico contribution helps  them  to shoot into the
charts at number 14.

CASUALTIES:

Despite all the votes for 'Brain  Damage',  Aggression slip out of the
top ten. Slithering down along  side  them are Synergy. The confusions
and ST Knights are other crews  struggling  at the moment, although if
Jace   can   complete   'Ressurection'   expect   things   to   change
signficiantly.

PREDICTIONS:

Syntax look set to rule the ST world, although since Yoyo is busy with
school they will lose out  as  other  ST  crews  release demos at EIL.
Defjam has  shown  flashes  of  brilliances,  and  a  full  demo could
establish checkpoint as the top ST group.


The recent Oxygene  and  Cream  releases  should  ensure  strong chart
positions for these teams next time.  With  DHS  working on a demo for
EIL, expect them to go top 5 next time.

This really was a titanic  battle  as  best of friends/best of enemies
Agent T and Mod  grabbed  their  paintbrushes  (erm, shouldn't that be
mice? - ED) and fought a battle to  the death. Mod led the field for a
long time, but as football manager say  "it's a marathon not a sprint"
and the cream graphist overtook him at the final fence.

These  two  pixel  crazed  germans  are   a  long  way  ahead  of  the
competition, with Flan  in  a  distant  third.  Fellow frenchie, Niko,
takes fourth place and Tanis,  rather  strangely, shoots up the charts
from 17th to 5th.

Logo king and professional student, sh3, is satisfied with 6th, whilst
the highest new entry goes to  edo  of  sector  one who paints his way
into 7th. ST Survivor is  another  Frenchy  on  the march, storming up
into joint 7th. Dean Chadwick is an  unlikely 9th, with the painter of
the great Maggie menu picture, Ripley, completing the top 10.

CASUALTIES:

Remember Lance of Aggression? Well he seems to have been forgotten
as he crashes out of the charts from last issue's  number 8. Es, McFly
and Thomas are also on their way down.

PREDICTIONS:

Another epic battle from Agent T and Mod. And where are all the Polish
graphists? They can certainly make great  demos,  but it would be nice
to see one their pixellers higher than 20th.

Final Fantasy is certainly  my  favourite  NES  release,  and its also
yours. This fantastic RPG forced me  to  stay  up for a 36 hour gaming
session with me retiring to bed  safe  in the knowledge that I'd saved
the world from the dangerous orbs (or something).

The mario brothers can't  take  the  challenge  from Final Fantasy and
slip to second. The GBX  release  of  megaman  2  will the new enhance
gameboy emulation system debuts at number 3.

CASUALTIES:

Kirby's Dreamland slips down to  9th,  with  the original Megaman also
falling to this position following the enhanced GBX release.

Space invaders leaves the charts completely.

PREDICTIONS:

Knowing RG they probably have all  sorts  of crazy games lined up with
intros, trainer modes and enhacments to the emulation system. But then
again they may all be down  at  'Raising  The Deep' club raving to the
drum'n'bass sounds. Rinsing.


NOTE: RG get no super leage points from this category.

Nutrition crazed Toodeloo is top of the pops! "its all to do with what
you eat for breakfast" he  explains,  before  exposing his buttocks to
those lower down the charts them him, which is everyone else.

A teardrop forms  on  505's  face  and  he  snuffles  into  his snuff,
wondering if he'll ever be able  to  claim the top spot. MSG complains
long and loud to no-one in  particular  about how he should be higher.
sh3 just goes to sleep, whilst MC  Laser  reels off a complete list of
all the games on automation manus 1-500 entirely from memory.

XTD is so happy about shooting up  from  31st to 5th that he dances on
Antilamah's toes. The teenage member pretends not to notice, wondering
instead who the strange duo standing behind him are.

CASUALTIES:

Ginger spice leaves the spice  girls!  Damon Blur and Justine Elastica
splite up. Derek Dalahrge.

PREDICTIONS:

The beat goes on. One nation under a groove.

Vectronix emphasise their status  as  the  best  crackers on the Atari
scene, with Elite falling down to third.  A lot of the votes for other
crews are coming by the way of nostalgia.

CASUALTIES:

Lots of protection systems.

PREDICTIONS:

With the recent departures  of  key  members  of vectronix and Elite's
activites slowing down,  tumbleweed  may  begin  to  blow  across this
section.

Vectronix show why they are  rated  as  the best cracking team, having
their two crackers joint first in  the  charts. Orby of Elite is third
with fellow Elite member Pervert in 8th.

CASUALTIES:

Metallinos and  Phoenix  have  since  quit  Vectronix  so  it  will be
interesting to see how this affects this chart.

PREDICTIONS:

New Vectronix leader, SJX, has a lot  of pressure on his shoulders. He
needs to establish himself with some good  hacks. Expect to see him on
the charts next time.  The  re-arrangement  of  Vex  may give Orby and
Pervert a chance to move to the top of the charts.

We may be late. We may have 'too  many  jokes' ( (c) Jam Butty ) or be
totally 'ridiculous', 'slow', 'too serious', 'not serious enough' have
'too much scene coverage' or  'not  enough  scene  stuff' or 'too much
boring applications' or 'not enough GEM tools' - it really depends who
you speak to. But when  everyone  speaks  with  one voice, they decide
that actually Maggie is pretty good. The original, and still the best.

The ratio between the top magazine  and second place reamins virtually
the same, but Toxic  has  gained  a  few  extra  points and has firmly
establish itself as the third best magazine. Under this we have a rag-
taggle of old, unfinished and unread stuff.

CASUALTIES:

Atarphile is moved to the great atari diskmag graveyard.

PREDICTIONS:

A new team of journalists and  coders  will create a brand new diskmag
that will be better  written  than  any  of  the  other  mags here and
everyone else will be forced to give up.

OK, so its not going  to  happen.  Things  will probably just stay how
they are, although the future of  Toxic  looks  a bit uncertain at the
moment.

Bonanza! People seem happy  with  all  the  extra  features the Maggie
shell has bought to them. "It's like having a cinema in your own home"
said an old man who  smelled  of  wee.  He  was  talking living in the
toilets of the local cineman at the time.

EarX's enhacments to the UCM shell see it picking up some extra points
over last time, but there  seems  to  be  no other diskmags being made
with interesting shells. Come on you coders, chop chop!

CASUALTIES:

Tat of Avena, curator of the  museum  known as the 'Delta Force Maggie
Shell' has had to gone  medievil  on  our  asm and disappeard from the
world of diskmag shell maintainance.

PREDICTIONS:

More enhacments for the UCM shell  seem  on  the cards. RG may have to
take the ST Maggie Shell under there wings and dust it down a bit.

The legendary Tat intro on Maggie #18  that heralded the arrival or RG
Maggie and the new Falcon shell is considered by all to be a classic.

The runner up is  just  "maggie",  with  many  people not specifying a
particular issue. "They are all good" you  seem to be saying, which is
a good answer, but not the right answer.

The symposium inspired  Maggie  #20  intro  is  joint  second with the
Mystic Bytes maggie #25  intro  sliding  into  fourth. Tat's wizard ST
intros are dotted all  over  the  charts,  the  highest being intro to
issue #21 which comes in at fifth.

Elsewhere the bizarrest vote comes  for  UCM 10, which didn't actually
have an intro (unless you count the  'Poets Of Decay' logo which fades
on at the start). The voters names have been kept anonymous to protect
the guilty, but given who they are you may perhaps expect them to be a
bit more familiar with intros for this magazine.

CASUALTIES:

The maggie 27 intro! Although we  have  seen a preview (and its great)
it was not ready in time and we  really couldn't hold the mag back any
longer.

PREDICTIONS:

Intros will be coded and put  on  the  start of disk magazines. People
will watch them and say "oh that  is  quite nice" then press space and
forget all about them.

The new maggie deputy editor takes the top spot from editor CIH. Given
the controversial nature of some of  the  comments he made last issue,
he pronounces that he is "suprised, delighted and strangely aroused".

Toxic writer ST Survivor jumps up  into  the top 3 closely followed by
Richard Karsmakers - the  writer's  writer.  The  mad rantings of Jody
Smith have obviously tickled you as  you  lift  him  up into the top 5
with moondog falling down to fifth.

Paranoid is the highest new entry  following  a string of well written
articles.

CASUALTIES:

Atari Computing writer Joe Connor falls to ninth. Perhaps his in depth
anlaysis of the recent re-orgnasition  of Vectronix wasn't well enough
researched.

PREDICTIONS:

ST Survivor may not be writing much  more for Toxic so the third place
could be up for grabs. There has  been  a lot of friction between some
UCM writers so it will be interesting to see what happens here.

Black Scorpion Software's Apex  Media  leads  the  field  again. Its a
shame that Apex 3 will  probably  never  see  the light of day. Escape
Paint is getting better all the time and fights it way up to third.

Crack Art seems to be the choice  of ST Painters, with GodPaint coming
in at fourth followed by the powerful but awkward Rainbow Paint.

Graoumf may have the worst name  for  a  tracker program ever, but you
still love it  -  even  more  than  pro  tracker!  Digital takes third
followed by octalyser. The best sequencer seems to be, unsurprisingly,
Cubase.

Elsewehre we have all sorts  of  things  being voted for including the
Big Demo and the MCoder music disk. You crazy kids!

Assembly language is the  choice  for  an  atari generation. Just wait
until we get our hands on the  Phenix  and  the 060 with its less than
one cycle per instruction with its  dual  integer units and super fast
floating point unit (you can stop drooling now - ED).

C takes second,  beating  off  competition  from  GFA  Basic, STOS and
Pascal.

In sixth we have C++, a language  which  should be adopted more by the
atari community. Reservoir Gods are currently making the transition to
C++ and will be creating a set of Falcon libraries for this language.

Note the comedy votes at the bottom of the chart!

There can be only one! The  Dead  Hackers Pages remain unchallenged in
the top spot - their range  of  news, downloads and the bulletin board
make it hard to beat.

Reservoir Gods Pink Pages take the second place. Now that MrPink has a
modem, he promises to start updating them again regularly just as soon
as he has finished this issue of maggie.

The little green  desktop  is  third,  closely  followed  by the newly
formed Atari Org  site.  The  TCB  is  a  surprising  5th, followed by
Xonline one of my personal favourite pages.

great Jinnee in third.  Comedy  vote  award  goes  to the little green
desktop.

Those bloody swedes get  everywhere!  And  their  strange country also
wins the slightly pointless 'Best  Country'  charts.  Good too see the
Chinese atari scene finally getting some recogntion.

contribution he has  made  to  the  scene  with  tunes  for demos like
'Cycedelic Knockout', the Avena/DC  Fried  Bits  3  demo 'Enrage' and,
most significantly, 'Sonoluminesznez', should never be forgotten.

The Dead Hackers Society win  the  Super  League  for the second issue
running. Again, they are the only crew  to amass more than 1,000 super
leage points.

DHS are strong in most categories,  picking up considerable votes from
the Falcon Megademo, 4k  intro,  Falcon  Coder,  Musician and HomePage
charts. They are not so  strong  on  the  ST  side  of things, but the
release of their EIL demo could improve this situation.

The Reservoir Gods are second, some  300  points behind. In fact, they
would have to combine with Mystic Bytes to knock DHS off the top! They
pick up most of their points from the Games, Coder, Musician, Graphics
Artist and Homepage  sections,  but  really  need  some  big  demos to
challenge for the top spot.

The Maggie Team are a strong  third  with  avena some way back in 4th.
TSCC and Poets of Decay make  up  the  rest  of the top six, which has
remained static since the last issue.

TCB shoot up to seventh - the creation  of a best ST Demo category has
ensured they gain lots  of  votes.  Mystic  Bytes stay eighth, perhaps
lacking the range of activities and productions to break into the very
top places.

'Do  Things'  has  given  Cream  a  leg  up  into  ninth  and  Running
Development Team complete the top  atari  crews, proving the virtue of
doing one thing really well.

New Beat are hovering just outside the  top 10, and surely the release
of Flu and FlexTrax will push them higher next time.

Syntax are the highest climbers,  racing  up  from 42nd to 12th. Given
the quality of "sometimes the bumblebee  flies higher than the falcon"
this is no surprise.

CheckPoint  and  Oxygene  also  move  up   the  charts  and  have  the
capabilities to do even better next time.

Elswehere Escape hit the  top  20  and  Fun  race  up  from 100 to 35,
showing the impace of releasing good quast demos.
