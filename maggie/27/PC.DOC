The Story of MicMac... 

This sad tale from Richard Karsmakers shows that there is something 
worse in life than a rogue Wintel PC.. When it goes wrong, you have to 
deal with the tribe of arseholes, timewasters and money-grubbing f*ck-
ups that have grown up around it, to 'service' your needs! - CiH 

Around the middle of July, around the 20th to be more precise, my 
computer suffered from a hard disk crash. This is a thing that tends to
happen on PCs occasionally, which is one of the reasons why I miss what
used to be my good old Atari so much. The crash caused me to have to 
get the hard disk replaced, and I lost all my program settings. That 
wasn't too bad as such; what was bad was that I'd lost all my stored 
Netscape email, my bookmarks and, worst of all, my email addresses. 

I was feeling pretty dejected, as you might imagine. Thankfully, I 
actually had two physical hard disks attached to my computer. The 
second physical hard disk contained my databases (customer and friends 
addresses and a few more), quite a few web page enhancements (the 
scriba.org hard disk had crashed about a week or two earlier, and I'd 
not been sitting still, and had written a lot  of stuff and enhanced 
almost all pages), my Atari and PC programming source files, quite a 
few files I had prepared for my job to teach VBA and VB...and a lot 
more that you may perhaps imagine. This second physical hard disk 
contained over 600 Mb of data. 

Three days after I had handed in the PC to have the first hard disk 
replaced, I went to the shop - MicMac - to get it back. Upon arrival, 
however, I was told that, accidentally, they had formatted the wrong 
physical hard disk after they'd replaced the one that actually needed 
to be replaced. I think my head went really red, I felt dizzy, and I 
had the all-consuming idea that this was a nightmare I was in. The most 
recent backup I'd made dated back to late March (1998, thankfully); it 
meant they had basically wasted four months of work here. 

What are things coming to when you can't even trust a computer shop to 
be able to format the right hard disk? Maybe I had invited fate when I 
had specifically told them not to touch the second hard disk. Who 
knows? 

Be that as it may, half a week after my original computer crash I was 
now, as we say in Holland, even further from home. What started now was 
weeks of waiting. Waiting while attempt after attempt was made, 
apparently, to try and recover the data. For the technicians among you: 
It was a 2 Gb hard disk formatted with FAT32, on which the "FORMAT D:" 
command had been let go. Without a computer, I had literally nothing to 
do. You don't know what you got until you lose it, kind of thing. I 
read at least a dozen books instead. I mean, you've got to do something 
with your free time, right? 

It was August 17 when I called them back. I inquired what was 
happening. They hadn't called me at all during that whole time, over 
three weeks. I assumed they'd been working their collective arses off, 
quite like they ought have. As it turned out, the guy responsible for 
both the deletion and the intended recovery had been on a holiday for 
two weeks. Clearly, delegating such a task to someone else had been an 
impossibility. These guys had f*@ked up my hard disk and now they went 
really liberal with the time they spent trying to fix it...basically 
doing nothing for a whole two weeks. When you work in the computer 
industry and when your life revolves around serious projects on the 
World Wide Web, being without a computer for a day can be terrible. But 
over three weeks, let me tell you, is sheer agony. I envisioned my 
email provider bouncing back messages because of a mailbox overflow. 

Still, so they claimed, hope remained. They had in the mean time 
discovered that it was FAT32 that the hard disk had been formatted 
with, and they expected a useful tool for FAT32 recovery 'any day now'. 

When they hadn't called by August 21st, I decided to call them again. 
My hopes were smashed. They had failed to find a working tool. They 
were unable to recover anything. Although the feeling of being in a 
nightmare wasn't quite as intense as the first time, it was there 
again. And it wasn't pleasant. I had written a complete PC program 
("Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged", available for download from the 
ST News Lamentation Pages after my last backup. Its source code had 
vanished. I would not be able to produce updates of the program. I had 
met a friend in town that I hadn't seen for years and who'd moved to 
another city. She'd given me her address which I had dutifully entered 
in "Access". Now, that database, too, was gone. I had written quite a 
few inspired book reviews for World Wide Web Multi Media Magazine 
(W3M3). Now these, similarly, had entered data nirvana. 

I decided I might as well get back the computer at least, with the 
replaced hard disk. At least then I could reinstall everything, write 
letters again, check my email, that kind of thing. I turned out to have 
over 350 email messages. I spent the better part of a day sifting 
through them, incidentally succeeding in establishing once more about 
three quarters of my "Netscape" email address book. When I fetched the 
PC I was told that there was perhaps one more chance; one of their 
employees had a friend in Amsterdam who "did data recovery". They'd 
make sure the hard disk got checked over by them. That was Saturday, 
August 22nd. 

Around the middle of the week, Wednesday to be more exact, I gave them 
a call again. They seem to have some sort of ingenious device on their 
phone that prevents them from calling out, I guess. As it turned out, 
those data recovery friends had failed to restore my data. They, too, 
claimed it was impossible. By now the nightmare experience was bland, 
but recurrent nonetheless. We'd agreed that I'd get the hard disk back 
on Saturday. That way I could attempt a "remote data recovery" via a 
remarkable service offered at www.ontrack.com and try a few suggestions 
made by colleagues whose PC / hard disk crash experience vastly 
surpassed mine, and then go to my last chance - a reputable data 
recovery outfit at about an hour from where I live. 

Not only are the people of MicMac incompetent, they can also not be 
relied on. And this, in fact, is the reason why this story was written 
in the first place. Possibly because of that little "no outgoing calls" 
device, they had not bothered to call me Friday evening when they 
already knew the hard disk was not going to be there. Now MicMac is not 
that far from where I live, but still it's the idea that counts. It's 
the idea that I have to go to the shop to be dismissed simply because 
some irresponsible tit had forgotten or not been able to get the hard 
disk back for me to collect, and failed to simply let me know. 

Tossers.
