It is never easy when undergound acts have come into the full glare of
the media spotlight. Underworld had created their own fusion of house,
techno, vocodered vocals and guitars which  was adored but a small and
faithful group - rather like the atari scene.

Then an old b-side was placed on a film soundtrack and the whole thing
went 'radio rental'. You couldn't  tune  into  a radio station or walk
into a pub or club without  hearing  those chords or that three letter
phrase.

This overnight super stardom  put  a  fair  amount  of pressure on the
'world, and for some time  it  looked  like  they were about to crack.
Last year, at a gig  in  Hamburg,  Rick  Smith  and Karl Hyde starting
wrestling with each other on stage. They were sick of each other, they
were sick of 'that' song, they were sick of Underworld.

My love affair with underworld began  when i first heard my flatmate's
copy of "Dubnobasswithmyheadman" back in  95.  It  was the best record
I'd heard in my life. It went  on  to become the soundtrack to my late
night coding sessions  for  Double  Bobble  2000  and  has  remained a
regular visitor of my CD player since.

Underworld's 2nd  album  "Second  Toughest  In  The  Infants"  had its
moments, but couldn't equal  the  majesty  of  their debut. There were
still some storming tunes on  their,  and  it became our soundtrack to
our journey to the  Siliconvention.  I  remember  Tat  having the tape
seemingly glued to his  walkman,  it  was  "perfect music for speeding
down the autobahn" apparently.

Underworld's post second toughest output  has  been limited to a track
on the Batman soundtrack.  "Moaner"  sounded  like  a pastiche of born
slippy with Karl Hyde slipping  yet  more  "boy"  lyrics into the mix.
Things were not looking great.

But after  a  rousing  glastonbury  appearance,  promos  of  some  new
underworld  tracks  got  the  juices  flowing.  "King  Of  Snake"  was
Underworld back to their best  with  a  driving Smith/Emerson beat and
Hyde's  echoing "Snake" recalling the epic Cowgirl.

The provisional title for  the  third  LP  -  "Tonight Matthew, We Are
Going To Be Underworld" - has been  ditched in favour of another piece
of Hyde style soundbite-stealing. "Beaucoup  Fish" begins with "Cups",
a track that leads you in  with a soothing orchestral arrangement with
melts into a laid back  groove  and  the trademarked vocodered vocals.
Its a track that could have found  a  home in a french house lp, which
is now (consults fashion dictionary) a compliment.

Like "Second Toughest", this opener is in different 'movements' and by
the end involves  into  a  more  recognisably  underworld style groove
before we are hit with current single "Push Upstairs".

I have to admit on disliking  this  track intensely when I first heard
it, but as Percy Thrower would say  "its a real grower". The juddering
melody, the dislocated vocals, the stop-start rhythms, it just doesn't
seem to work. But give it  time  and everything slots neater in place,
its a tune that enjoy more with each listen.

Jumbo is the trio at  their  dreamy  best.  It  begins with an elastic
bassline and a melody so simple it  could have come from the boards of
canada. Which is another  compliment.  A  great track this, especially
when all the synth washes come  in  -  its  sends a real shudder up my
spine. Think "m.e." for "Dubnobass.." and  you're  in the right area -
blissed out underworld heaven.

Shudder/King of snake is  another  Underworld  double whammy. Starting
with a fragmented oriental style melody before powering into "snake" -
a real rattlesnake rhythm and Karl in shouty mood. The mark e smith of
dance music returns. Again, that's supposed to be a compliment!

"Winjer" is hyde at  his  most  introspective.  Which  is  also at his
worst. We liking him  to  be  obscure,  bellowing  madness or mumbling
mindlessly, not whingeing  about,  er,  whingeing.  This is underworld
meets morrissey and it all  goes  horribly  wrong. Think "those boring
bits at the end of second toughest that you always skipped".

"Skyrm" is an underworld  ballad.  And  no,  it  doesn't  work. It's a
percussionless track with hyde  spouting  poetry  over a skeleton thin
layer of muzak. Horrible.

"Bruce Lee" is as far  from  a  typical  underworld track as you could
expect. Its more like  a  toned  down  Atari  Teenage Riot. File under
Small beat.

"Kittens" is the sound of  darren  emerson  - it is underworld heading
back to the dancefloor. A thumping techno  tune that is the natural to
successor so such 'large' tunes  as  "Rowla"  and  "Rez". It has a big
breakdown and everything. Massive.

"Push Downstairs" has the same lyrics as "Push Upstairs", but has much
more restrained musical  accompaniment.  It's  a  lot  better than the
other "techno-ballads"  on  this  LP,  but  its  not  as  good  as the
original. Nice sub-bass though.

"Something Like A Mama"  is  Hyde  at  his  most  bonkers - think "Mmm
Skyscraper..." and think "where does he  get  all his drugs from?" and
"can i have some". Like all the best underworld tracks, both weird and
great.

"Moaner" we know already, and its  another  tune that creeps up on you
before  sledgehammering  you  with   its  screeching  riff.  Brilliant
instrumentation, dodgy lyrics and  a  rather  inconclusive fade out at
the end.

"Beacoup Fish" has the makings of  a great album, but Underworld could
have done with another 6 months to  shave  off the fillers and write a
couple of a new tracks.  It's  certainly  a  more cohesive record than
"second toughest" and more eclectic than "dubnobass..." its great that
they haven't played the commercial card and banged out an lp of "born-
slippy" clones, but on the  other  hand  some of the more experimental
stuff should really have been left in the studio.

There's enough brilliance on this LP  to  leave most of the admiration
gasping with admiration - its only  because its Underworld that we ask
for more. Fish out the juicy tracks, cast aside the minnows and wonder
about the ones that got away.
