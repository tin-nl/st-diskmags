
               Maggie Awards, 1998, Just an average year..?

1998 was a veritable parsons nose of a year, a bit of goodness and 
enjoyable happenings interspersed with the odd rubbery sensation of 
biting down hard onto a chicken's willy without quite realising that 
you had put it into your mouth in the first place.. In this way, we had 
the high enjoyment of the ALT Party, but the crashing lowness of losing 
Tat to the Atari scene this year.. Just about typical for a year then..


Most Significant event of the year..

It wasn't the purchase of Atari intellectal rights from JTS, the 
carefree caretakers of the Atari name, by Hasbro, of 'My Little Pony' 
fame for a mere $5 million.. It may have been a toss-up between the 
arrival of the new Atari clone, the Milan, and the revival of 
confidence (from a UK point of view) at the Stafford Atari show.. 
French Atari people would point to the closure of both their existing 
Atari paper magazines.. Hung jury awaiting a clear casting vote then.. 

Best Game of 1998..

Still waiting for Willies Adventures? Yep..

There were a lot of smaller releases, but for genuinely new high 
specification mega-games for the Falcon, there was a definite racing 
theme, with the Exa Mario Kart clone 'K', and Nature's 'Reekin' Rubber' 
fighting for the top spot.. The latter game sounds like a good argument 
for getting a Centurbo II by the way! To look forward to in '99 - 
Willies Adventures (maybe, just maybe!), a hope of a multiplayer 
version of 'Running', Deez's 'Worms' game, Senior Dads to branch out 
into game-making?!? Republic?? 


Best Fiver Spent for 1998..

Take one fiver, now stack it up along with forty-nine of its little 
friends.. That makes 250 ukp, right? Now go along to the Staffordshire 
Atari show last November, and purchase Steve Delaney's Desktopper cased 
Falcon for that sum of money!


Trend to most carefully watch..

People who say to you "Getting a PC soon?" (If you haven't already got 
one, that is..).


"Told you so!" Award..

I didn't actually tell anyone this before, but I personally had the 
feeling that 'Binliner' was never going to quite get finished.. Even if 
Tat had stayed on the job, he's too much of a perfectionist to let 
anything get out very easily!


Best Utility, serious doobrie of 1998..

I'll put my vote behind 'Smurf', Therapy's new (since Symposium '96, 
anyway) image manipulation/conversion package.. With newer versions of 
just about everything else, quite an appealingly crowded field this 
time..

To watch.. A new French GEM-based art package which benefits from 
higher-spec hardware, that elusive Javascript capable web browser? 
Quite a lot of stuff in the music bracket (See the 'music' section..)


"Would you like a nice cup of tea to help wash down that fatuous but 
hopeful statement you made last year, and which you are now having to 
eat to hastily destroy the evidence, sir?"

"On the subject of Web browsers, just watch out next year!" - From the 
1997 archives.. This depended on God Browser bursting onto the scene, 
and making an immediate huge impact on the sedate world of CAB et al.. 
This hasn't happened as yet, although CAB has plodded along to version 
2.7, and Draconis is slowly appearing.. Still no Javascript as yet.. 
Must be waiting for Milan to make a bigger splash in the market place, 
or for more Falcons to be upgraded to something like Centurbo II 
standard?


Best music product of 1998..

Quite a choice between the various offerings of Softjee (Digital Home 
Studio and related products), the offerings of Electronic Cow Software, 
famous for their chip-based synthesisers and sample editors. Also the 
first fully authentic SID replay with FlaySID getting to version 3.02.

Eagerly awaited, Godtracker, the Res. Gods first excursion into MIDI 
with a MIDI sequencer/Protracker interface hybrid.. Thomas of New Beats 
tracker.. Also Graoumf Tracker II?


Best Vapourware/Rumour of 1998..

I don't know about the best vapourware rumour for '98, but there is a 
leading contender for the WORST vapourware rumour by a long way.. Who 
remembers the so-called 'Falcon emulator' for the PC, rumours for which 
cropped up in the middle of the year.. Various names of people we've 
never heard of before were given, along with URLs which mysteriously 
dead-ended to nowhere.. It is very hard to imagine how a full 
emulation, DSP and all, would be achieved, although one or two deluded 
souls suggested that certain PC soundcards had a DSP in them which 
would be a sufficient answer to that problem! Yes, well.....


Diskmag of the year..

Due to the pointless bickering that broke out during 1998, this 
category has been regretfully suspended..


Demo of the year..

The demo scene saw a lot of action, but nothing quite on the same 
sublime level of 1997's 'Sono'.. DHS came close with the very tunnelly 
'Dream Dimension', which wins the cup for best presented demo packing 
in the most Falcon-stretching technical wizardry at the same time.. 
Mentions go to the ever-prolific Polish scene, although we feel we have 
still yet to see the very best that they can do.. Another mention goes 
to Escape for their clever blending of audio and visual elements in 
their Quast demo 'Illness'..

Plenty doing at the smaller sized end, with DHS reprising Dream 
Dimension in 4k! A large cupboardfull of very good 4ktros from just 
about all the other crews too.. 

There was the rise and rise of the Dreaded 128 byte-tro, with Tat's 
last demo-related release tying with an awesome Pong game by a certain 
Swedish crew in 128 bytes! Polish warriors of the 68000, Syntax, had it 
all their own way with some stunning 3D object design and texturing on 
a humble ST.

To watch out for, several new and long-awaited ST productions, the 
Nostalgic-O demo from Leonard of Oxygene is expected any day now! The 
return of the ST demo seems to be a theme for the forthcoming Easter 
party at Dresden too.. With Falcon demos, the position is less clear-
cut, although DHS are working on another big demo, and the 'Binliner' 
source code completed thus far has been passed to someone else to play 
with (to quote Tat..) Most sensationally, it looks like at last the 
source code for the long-awaited 'Motion' demo is to appear!


Biggest Non-event of the year..

Binliner, Tat's follow-up to 'Sono, we eagerly awaited it, collected 
screenshots of it like other people collect rare stamps, and screamed 
when Tat decided to jack it all in.. 


Yellow Press Sulphuric Acid resistant Swimming trunks award..

To try to apply this on a strictly Atari scene level would be rather 
petty, small-minded and vindictive, so I won't.. Things have calmed 
down somewhat, so no point in stirring it all back up again.. 

The Fleet street tabloid press in the UK are all complete wankers, that 
fact is generally known now, and needs no further elaboration.. 
(Omigod, sounding like Felice now!?)


Hero of the year..

Deservedly awarded to Grey for his general presence and continued 
massive enthusiasm for the Atari scene! The runner-up is Setok for 
organising the ALT Party and doing such a fine job there..


Villain of the Year..

The management of Acorn Computing, see the next entry for more 
details..

  
Competitor  Misfortune, most  hilarious..

This is not very hilarious, as I had a grudging respect and liking for 
the company concerned.. 1998 was the year that Acorn Computers decided 
to drop out of the home computer market when they abandoned their 
'Phoebe' next gen RISC PC project.. Latest news suggests a rescue bid 
of the O/S, if not the hardware, by concerned Acorn fans, and Acorn 
even going as far as dropping the name 'Acorn Computers' as they 
concentrate on their Net TV project. Yet another bloodless victory 
handed on a plate to Bill Gates..

 
Wires Crossed media cock-up of 1998..

I've had to kick this category in the head for this year as well, as it 
would just have turned into an overlong and unfunny rant.. Do you 
detect a theme, based on recent past issues of Maggie here?! 


Better late than never..

Just about every major project on the Atari..

'Republic' by Reservoir Gods.. 
'Willies Adventures' 
Just about any demo from the German Scene...
(correction, just about any major pre-announced demo!)

Damn, these are the same nominations as for last year!!


Best Computer Show of 1998..

For me, a choice between the ALT Party, for vividly remembered 
experiences on Finnish shores, or the Stafford Show in the UK, where 
some serious shopping was undertaken.. Quite a lot of other good 
parties with many releases as well..

To watch out for - Another show in the UK in April, 'Error in Line' 
party at Dresden in Easter, another big Polish Party?


The Hype falters..

Bill in Court (yawn!), the other Bill in Court as well (double yawn!) 
"Monica Lewinski, what is she gonna look like with a chimney on her?" 
(Source of that fitting quote, Senior News.)


Best Virus of 1998(!)

At last, someone has named a lethally nasty PC virus after me!! The 
'CIH Virus' goes as far as trashing parts of a PCs hardware, and was 
erroneously spread by the British Telecom modem-play network.. Or was 
the choice of name some exquisite coincidence?? I didn't do it, anyway!


Dead and Back again award..

More a semi-undead sort of person, Requiem, not content with his 
atari.org efforts, has just re-entered the Falcon side of things.. The 
lucky machine is thought to be an original Hisoft development Falcy.. 
The Falcon Owners Group remains firmly coffin-side though..


Arrived in '98..

The Milan, Centurbo II, Godboy X, Christian Peppermuellers Oric 
emulator, CAB 2.7, MagiC 6, Jinnee, GEM Demo, Stafford County 
Showground and the Atari Computing Convention, Syntax as a force in ST 
demo coding, Da Boosters(!) a girl called Nicky and a cat called 
Frankie (personal note), a proper job for Mr Pink. the same for Tat. 
Also the arrival of  Kev Callahan (have you finished moving house yet 
mate?) Atari.org burst in on us too..   


Dead and gone for sure in '98..

Binliner, any enthusiasm for major projects from Ed Cleveland, the 
chances of any issue of Maggie getting out early, the heating system at 
the Staffordshire County Showground, Official French Atari newsstand 
magazines,  Syntax as a force in any demo coding, an early or vaguely 
'on-time' release date for anything now.. Steve Delany and Floppyshop, 
Tat, Saddest of all, Tommy of Avena.


Summing it all, up, the word that best describes 1998..

'Time', a severe lack of on the part of myself and most other Atari 
scene people.. If only they had 36 hour days, if only we could all go 
without sleep, if only we didn't have to go to work to earn a living!! 

     If only?!?

You get the picture!

 (C) CiH, Jan 1999 (If you see this name, don't worry, your system 
              hasn't been virus infected after all!)
