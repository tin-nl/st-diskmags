Pure GFA Basic Megademo!
by LOud

I don't know how to start this review off really.. A megademo, four 
years in the making, coded 100% in pure GFA Basic, without any Assembly 
language involved.. Yes, that's it!

This needs to be installed to a floppy disk, fortunately, not going 
really, really, retro, like the Nostalgic-O demo, but it won't run that 
well without one.. You do get so far with a Falcon, but no further, as 
everything slumps to a halt in front of the main menu.. So taking 
advantage of the award winning 'Dodgy STFM/Dodgy TV aerial cable 
combination' that starred at the Nostalgic-O write-up, it is time to 
venture forth yet again..

-----v-----

The other help, or should that be hindrance? are my handwritten notes, 
hastily scribbled down in the heat of the action.. Looking at the first 
scrawl, it reads back something like "Boil win Fronce"..

Not encouraging..

Memory, assisted a bit by peanut butter covered hot toast, takes over.. 
There is an initial loader screen, a lovely many-coloured affair, 
pretty even, some sort of 'floral tribute' to the demo.. Memory also 
reminds me that the colours are different from when the Falcon ran that 
bit (pretending to be an STe?) and what I am seeing on my STFM now.. A 
bolder 'Back in France' logo reminds you of what you are watching, then 
the opening credits take over..

This is a subtle starfield rushing towards the screen, and some credits 
in a slightly old-fashioned looking font.. Space goes on..

The main menu now, with cheerful digi-drum music and a 'mad' looking 
front-end.. A tiny sinus logo twists between two grotesque (demo?) 
faces, a menu selector reposes underneath.. Being the sort of people we 
are, we select the main part of the demo, otherwise known as "Beyond 
Imagination" - No false modesty here, although experienced demo viewers 
might like to try to have a stab at what is on offer.. Don't worry if 
you don't get anywhere by the end of the review, as we'll give you all 
the information that you need!

...Plunged straight into a Jess (OVR) tune, an onward rushing 'bubble' 
or 'bob' field, and a warping logo..

First major 'effect' screen next, a huge sprite zoomer, with a couple 
of penguins looking on at the vastly blown-up images of themselves 
whizzing around the screen.. No zooming in and out, unfortunately, but 
this one is quick, and controllable.. A mini scroller at the top tells 
you what the story is.. The other notable feature of this screen, is 
that there are no side borders! This 'border-less' state is repeated in 
several other screens, and would suggest some sneaky Assembly language 
routines, but apparently, someone took a look at the sourcecode, and 
found 100% GFA Basic! If this is really the case, then this is an 
incredible achievement for Thyrex, the coder..

Another stock effect, which would have been bang up to date when the 
demo was first conceived.. Wobbly 'jelly-balls'. semi-transparent, and 
several onscreen at the same time masking each other.. Think back to 
the 1994 class of Falcon demos.. Also a common 'design' feature of that 
period is the combination purple/blue background..

Another 'tween-screen', and a good showcase for a 'grimace' face 
graphic.. (Most still graphics by ST Survivor..)

Next up, is a neat realtime spline, followed by a bit of a joke..

"Hiroshima '45 - Chernobyl '85 - Windows '95!"

I'm sure you all get the idea!

A quickie screen, some flowing chunky dots, which hurl themselves into 
the corner of the screen.. Looks better than it sounds, and sadly over 
in a moment.. This is followed by the obligatory 'greets' screen, a 
slightly cramped looking affair.. This is a 'sineous scroller in a 
box', and certainly looks like one of the oldest parts of the demo..

Space to go on, and a bijou 'rave' pattern/still graphic combination 
screen.. The effect on the right hand side in a window..

Pause - ST Survivor fantasy themed Fuji logo, he has obviously worked 
for a long time on this..

A little bit of a 'Satiric-o-tro' next, cheap single bitplane dice, 
with the legend 'Intel Outside' inscribed on the faces, rolls forever 
towards you on an infinite chessboard landscape..

'Joker Inside' logo, then an eye-pleasing high definition chrome/plasma 
screen rolls by..

Another definite demo highlight now, a faithful reprise of a favourite 
'Holocaust' screen, with nine dot-balls rolling puppy-like around the 
screen.. This is 3600 dots worth! Well worth anyone's money, and all 
the more impressive for being done in GFA Basic.. Did I mention the 
little wet patch of 'design' in the bottom right corner?

This is nearly the end, and so it is, that the final logo (an 'NLC' 
one, drawn by Flan of Exa this time) reluctantly drags its feet in..

Then it is all over, and we are cast back out into the cold 
thoroughfare of the main menu..

Well almost..

There are still three other options on the menu to explore. Prodding 
cautiously, we go in..

'Bonus' - The one we got on least well with.. Not a lot going on, seems 
to be some kind of info screen about the long history of this demo? 
Maybe a mouse needed?

'Info' - This is a more interesting screen by far.. Has the look of an 
early effort, in design terms, but technically accomplished.. It 
manages to combine a top half multiple raster bar orgy, with a bottom 
half starfield, only kept apart by a single split-screen.. The term 
'chalk and cheese' leaps to my throat.. But it somehow works!

'Greetings' - Beauty, followed by the beast.. Another pretty 'floral 
tribute' screen, but when you think the programmer is getting in touch 
with his 'design' side, a raw looking single bit 'BIF' logo shoulders 
its way in.. Coarse looking bubbles float by saying things like "Ere 
John, wot's goin' down at the gaff?" (Alright, I made up that very last 
bit!)

Exiting back to the main menu once more, then we are tipped out onto 
the desktop.. It really is all over..

-----v-----

So, was it worth the four year wait?

I would say, yes.. 

Many of the individual screens have dated a bit over that time, but the 
overall standard is good.. With the release of 'Nostalgic-O' and the 
popularity of the retro scene, that doesn't matter quite as much now..  
It is also all the more impressive for being conceived and created in 
pure GFA Basic.. I'm sure that if LOud wanted a crack at some more 
'modern' effects in GFA, then they would go a long way in succeeding..

Ratings..

I'm avoiding a normal ratings system on this one, due to the variable 
age range of the material.. This demo might well objectively lose out 
on its 'dated' look in places, but would gain in the 'Gee-whiz' 
category due to the programming language used.. So, we'll just go for 
an 'overall' mark..

Overall:- 83%
