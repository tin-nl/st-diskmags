
Öç...Quast Party 4k Intros...

In common with most recent coding parties that generate a high release 
rate, the Quast event managed a goodly proportion of 4k intros, either 
during, or soon after the event.. As usual, many of these could be 
mistaken for full sized demos in their own right by untrained 
observers.. (Which we're hopefully not!)

 Ö4-Some by Deez/Mind Design..

Kicking off with Deez's 'not quite Quast' effort, a 4ktro with a jokey 
'DHS Killer' reputation, but Deez chooses to be sensibly modest about 
the scope of this intro.. A choice of RGB and VGA executables, FPU is 
required..

A bit of a blur to begin with, a fading intro text, and a super-
perspected fuzzy 'Mind' logo starts proceedings with a bang..

Next, are some very familiar Deez type effects, the return of the 
blobs, these ones being hollow-centred, with not even a single colour 
to hide their brazenness.. Colliding, merging, splitting apart again, 
some sneaking metaphor about the rhythm of life that eludes tired late 
night braincells.

A multicoloured unfussy plasma follows.. After that, a bumpmap, plain 
unadorned, maybe a bit 'seen it before'?

A very slow ripple, forming out of some of the most cheesily artificial 
'water' I've ever seen.. Still, even this has its good side, transfixed 
as the effect goes on.. Very soothing..

Coming to a climax, the bumpmap returns, having smartened up its act, 
it is a nice double lightsourced bumpmap, subtle, a lovely litle twist 
on a common effect.

To finish with, a final burst of blobs.. These are brighter 'nova' 
blobs with a dazzling centre, as if the stars themselves had come out 
to play?

In conclusion, a decent 4k's worth.. Not really offering anything that 
new to the genre, but competently put together..

 73% - Follower rather then a setter of trends..


 Ö4orce by DHS..

Of course, any masterclass in 4k intro creation would not be complete 
without a whopping great dissertation handed in by those mad Swedish 
people, the (whisper it!) Dead Hackers Society.. Ever since the '97 
Orneta party, these guys have been (nearly) the last word in 4k-dom.. 
Have they maintained this reputation with this Quast effort? We shall 
see..

VGA or RGB versions available, but don't forget the FPU! Oh, and it'll 
run on accelerators and fastRAM withou losing the plot..

The first thing that hits you, is something that hits your ears.. Yes, 
there is a proper soundchip tune by Tao of Cream, taking up about 2k's 
worth of the 4k! So this is really a 2k intro, with music..

The first effect flirts onscreen about now, a freaky effect coming and 
going, eating itself raw, then vomiting itself whole again.. I'm sure 
there is a boring mathematical name for it, but me being me,  I prefer 
to use the more memorable 'mastication-regurgitation' metaphor! 

A survival of previous demos and intros, the rosette, usually seen as 
the terminating point of a madly elaborate tunnel.. Today, in a more 
genteel role prancng onscreen, colliding, separating, colliding, two of 
these at it constantly..

If this is not enough, the rosette twins are relegated to a supporting 
role, by the sudden appearance of a huge and brash gouraud poly, a 
tubular angled beast, which spins in the foreground, whilst the 
rosettes become an elaborate (still moving) background.. This screen 
definitely a tour-de-force for 4ktro's..  

Next is a fat and fast psycho-delic tunnel, which the viewer rushes 
ever blindly downwards..

Nearly at the end, a complete change of mood with some dodgy blocky 
plasma letters of fire.. These form the credits for those people who 
did the business here.. A little bit out of place, but I suppose, 
included to show that it could be done in the limited space available..

Finally, the  gouraud poly returns for a solo turn right at the finish, 
spinning endlessly, end on end..

Generally, this had a lot going for it, certainly still keeping up the 
pace of innovation, and definitely the smoothest and best presented of 
all the entries here..

 88% - Another distinctive DHS contribution..
 

Ö Fury by Mystic Bytes..

Mystic Bytes motto on this occasion may well have been "It's my party, 
and I'll code if I want to!" As they bring their own distinctive 
contributions to the proceedings, both in the main demo competitions, 
and also in the 4k arena.. Mystic Bytes, by clever recycling of certain 
effects, manage to get a full ten (count 'em!) screenfuls in this 
entry.. We really are getting to the point where the distinctions 
between big and little demos are getting very blurred.. Oh, and I'm not 
counting the 'Falcon Gravis soundcard joke' in there either!

I've got a feeling this avoids needing an FPU, but makes up for that by 
running on RGB only? Careful with the positioning on that Nemesis  
RGB switch, by the way!

The obligatory joke about the Falcon Gravis not being detected.. A 
satirical comment on the way most PC demos conduct themselves, I 
imagine..

A very nice credit sequence starts the demo proper.. These are 
bumpmapped credits, followed by some bumpmap pattern blocks, which form 
a grey transition to the next effect..

This is a dark and visually unappealing texture-mapped tunnel, very 
basic textures, not a lot to see, but don't write this one off just 
yet..

A more active screen, again, mostly dark and brooding, this time, waves 
rush toward the foreground, reminiscent of the opening bit of 'Sono', 
but a lot slower and chunkier..

The tunnel, first mentioned a couple of paragraphs ago, makes a 
return.. This time, a much better proposition, brighter, more solid 
looking tunnel, with just a slight suggestion that the end might split 
into two?

A rather nice liquid melting bumpmap screen follows, blue is the 
colour, searing to brightness..

A distorted version of that old tunnel, as if it was being subjected to 
crushing forces beyond human endurance!

A quickie screen, something like rushing along the Martian desert in 
your Mars Lander hotrod.. Assuming the Martian desert is reasonably 
flat and chunky..

The bumpmap part of the demo really stretches itself this time, with 
something best described as a 3D whirlpool effect, repeated several 
times across the screen.. Arguably, the best screen of the whole demo!

And finally, a last look at the tunnel which has kept us company so 
faithfully all along, a 'double vision' splitting version!

Mystic Bytes manage to make the most of their 4ktro.. A very 
distinctive 'house style' is present, more rough and ready than DHS, 
but still vey well constructed, and offering the best 4ktro in quantity 
of effects, even if they were pipped at the post by DHS's superior 
finishing..

 80% - Amazing capacity to keep going..
