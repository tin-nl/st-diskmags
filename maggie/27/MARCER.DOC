 Living slightly dangerously, I decided to interview with someone that
many would say is a 'bad influence  on  the scene'. I can hear some of
you already, 'we don't  need  them','Atari  Killahz',  but it can't be
denied that they exist. I am not  trying  to give them any fame, but I
thought it may  be  intresting   reading  for  the  rest  of  us. This
interview is with Marcer of Elite.

Session Start: Sun Oct 11 21:44:52 1998

    MSG : hmm...maybe I'll skip the real name part as that might get
          you into troubles!
 Marcer : :)

    MSG : Ok then, How old are you ?
 Marcer : I'm hmm.. 1+3+10
    MSG : 14...I don't believe that!!! :)
 Marcer : -1
 Marcer : ok. add more 10
 Marcer : it will be 23
    MSG : ...he he...cryptic!

    MSG : So Marcer...when was the first time you saw an ST ?

 Marcer : I saw it in a Computer magazine.. I was actually buying an
          amiga but I bought an STfm in 1988. My friend got mad about
          it, so I just only bought the STFm.

    MSG : what was the first thing you used the ST for ?
 Marcer : Games... all that 21 you got in the package.. :)
    MSG : 21 ?
 Marcer : Super Pack, it was called. If i remeber it right.. :)
 Marcer : thundercats and thrust etc.. golden oldies :)
    MSG : cool!
 Marcer : Mmmm.... OrgaZmm! Orgazm! :)

    MSG : So what got you into ELiTE ?
 Marcer : Actually my BBS which was called wet dreamz at that time.. I
was talkin with Sledge a lot, he asked  me  if I wanted to be an Elite
SHq BBS. I said yes.

    MSG : How did that happen ? one day you bought the ST, the next
          you have a BBS ?
 Marcer : ahh.. you want some history.. ok.. lets start over!
    MSG : he he, exactly...I want some history!

 Marcer : First of all I started to like those games and I got tired
          of the 21 games I already had. So I checked around and
          started to swap, and I got into this jungle of elite dudes
          pretty fast. So I was swapping with those ICS, elite,
          Syndicate etc..
    MSG : go on..
 Marcer : So I also started up a lame crew called The Legion with some
          fellows. A Gfa basic coding crew, released a lot of demos..
          and The public enemys like our shitty intros and wanted us
          in their crew, and we made a couple of intros for them (TPE
          was one of the formers for Syndicate!). After awhile we
          quited those bastards since they got mad at me since I stole
          100 disks from Emling (he changed his name all the time) but
          he was also memeber of ICS I think, anyway. so.. Now I have
          got my first Modem 1200bps! Ruled! :)
    MSG : :) then you started swapping on the modem and then the BBS
          started ?
 Marcer : Correct, I relized that I wanted to start up a BBS as all
          others. So. With this 1200bps, 20mb Sh205. I got my first
          BBS! called Legion.

    MSG : Was that a long time ago ? Do you still do a BBS ?
 Marcer : I think it was around 1990/91 it ran, and yeah I still have
          my bbs! Elite's Hideout. 7Cds Pirate and about 4.3gb Cool
          Warez! :)
    MSG : tut,tut...

    MSG : Do you see a future with BBS because of the internet taking
          over ?
 Marcer : The internet will crash soon. Then all ppl will come and
          thank me! :)
    MSG : he he he :)

    MSG : When do you think ELiTE became BIG ?
  Marcer: since elite was formed by some of the Crackin scene most
          famous guys it begun big! Maybe some ppl got confused about
          Empire/MCA/hotline in one big union which was elite.. :)

    MSG : I know that you recently bought an Amiga, how is that
          working out ?

 Marcer : Well... It was fun (for) as long as I had it! I sold it to
          my father 1 month later :)
    MSG : :)

    MSG : What do think about the whole Faramir Vs Vectronix thing (I
          don't even know what it's about!)
 Marcer : kind of Childish. well.. what do they say.... Lika barn leka
          bst.. in direct to english... Same kids plays together best
          ... :) since it was a chatter between phoenix vs Faramir..

    MSG : he..he..Are you happy to still be on ATARI ?
 Marcer : It's my life man!
    MSG : :) great stuff...

    MSG : Are you happy about Elite coming back and ruling atari
          again!
 Marcer : have we ever been away ?
    MSG : Well maybe you had a 'quiet time', like everyone on ATARI...
 Marcer : Well nah, that time was when Faramir was the leader for
          elite..

    MSG : Did he make a bad name for ELiTE and you ?
 Marcer : Yep, thats why all other elite members voted for me as a new
          leader hmm.. I think it was Summer of 96..

    MSG : and that's when you started to turn around Elites bad name ?
 Marcer : yeap. and that wasn't easy.. Since on all charts elite was
          in the bottom but I drag it up to the No1! for a while :)

    MSG : he he he... What do you think makes Vectronix voted number
          one ?
 Marcer : they keep on this VexNews. that's it

    MSG : Do you not want to do a Elite news ? :)
 Marcer : we don't inform our fans. Since we don't have time for it.
          we crack proggs. and are not any Text writers..maybe we
          should ask phoenix to be a eliteNews writer :)

    MSG : :) when did orby join ?
 Marcer : in the begining of 97
    MSG : since then Elite have been cracking everything...do you
          think this is bad ?
 Marcer : yeah it's bad in one way.. it means even all those smaller
          and worthless progs but in the same way we take all in our
          way :)

    MSG : How do you feel about orby in poland and not in sweden ?
          Does this upset you ?
 Marcer : nah. It's workin pretty good anyway. Email is good. but it
          would be more fun to have the whole elite in my
          neighbourhood!
    MSG : it's good to have all this activity coming from Poland isn't
          it ?
 Marcer : yeah they are cheap to hire :) well, they are important for
          this computer since they are really active guys!

    MSG : yeah...There has been a lot of talk concerning cracking so
          called 'scene programs', what do you think about that ?
 Marcer : We have some deals with some ppl to not touch their prgs! We
          respect some of'em and some not. Crackin is crackin.. we
          must also survive :)
    MSG : Do they offer money ?
 Marcer : they should offer us money! hmm.. maybe i should use that
          one. :)

    MSG : As well as being in Elite what else do you do (in your spare
          time) ?
 Marcer : I Do music. kind of Sash/antlioope/e-type. I hoping to get a
          job as a producer in the future.

    MSG : Can we download any examples of your music from anywhere ?
 Marcer : yep on Http://www.algonet.se/~marcer, this one was supposed
          to be stolen form another Producer, thats why I have this
          small sample of it online, personaly I think its one of my
          lamest hooks.. :) since the producer wanted to steal my
          hooks I got paranoid and don't have the guts to have any
          other tunes online. :(
    MSG : that's fair enough, I am sorry to hear that.

 Marcer : Also I work as an OPmachine guy on my dads factory.
    MSG : What do you do ?
 Marcer : I programm and control a nice Robot.
    MSG : What does the robot do ?
 Marcer : the robots are doing some Metalurgy works kind of
          multioperations
    MSG : Metalurgy ?
 Marcer : here is my english going away :) next question !!!! :)
    MSG : he he he he :)
 Marcer : I don't know the right words in this kind of terms
    MSG : (it's ok...don't worry about it!)

    MSG : so, What is your average day like ?
 Marcer : I get up at 06.00 get to work at the factory at 06.05, I
          really start at 06.00 but I like to sleep!. Quit work at
          14.00, get home, sleep until 16.00. Make music until 20.00..

    MSG : Are you glad you bought it ?
 Marcer : I had lots of trouble to get it, so yeah I was really happy
          when it arrived! but I had expect it to be faster .. :)

    MSG : Well it means Elite can continue on this fine machine.
 Marcer : yeap, since almost all elite memeber has an Falcon :)

    MSG : You said that you have a psx ?

    MSG : he he he...do you feel guilty about all this piracy ?
 Marcer : hmm.. nice weather!!
 Marcer : those prices.. makes me sick!
    MSG : :)

    MSG : Can you see a future for the Atari in general ?
 Marcer : I think that we are the last generation on this machine.
          Since PC is too big.. there is some solutions but no hope in
          this machine, too bad but I think thats the true. elite and
          my bbs will never die.

    MSG : What do you think about the clones (Milan,Phenix,etc) ?
 Marcer : Too expensive, and naahh! but CentrurboII.. interesting
          indeed! I want one! (if this Switch worx!)
    MSG : (me too!)
    MSG : Do you ever wished you were on the 'good' side of the scene?
 Marcer : I begun in that side.. but ppl wasn't that kind, the more
          nicer ppl were in this side. Which I think is the really
          nice side!

    MSG : Are you still in touch with the OLD ELite ? Are they still
          alive ? :)
 Marcer : I was supposed to get some new Logos from Hotline, but they
          didn't show up. They are alive but not in elite. Sledge made
          a page about elite/hotlines history. We have an Link from
          our page to this.

    MSG : right the game...what do you think of the ST ?
 Marcer : nice Computer! I'm sad about I have sold it. I have my sTe
          Left! :)

    MSG : fo3o ?
 Marcer : Fo3o, it haven't reached it limits yet! more to expect!

    MSG : Jag ?
 Marcer : More like an Experiment Console. Too bad, those guys should
          keep up the console. I think it could been a nice game
          console.

    MSG : Atari scene ? (is there one ?)
 Marcer : it's only the scene guys left.. the lamers has left this
          machine. thats why the atari is going down :) we need those
          buyers!

    MSG : pc ?
 Marcer : yeps.. Lamers buys PCs..
 Marcer : PC. Internet and Packin stuffs. nothin else..

    MSG : what do you think of the psx ?
 Marcer : psx. nice game console..

    MSG : Where do you think the future lies ?
 Marcer : Project X. And PC's Emulation programs.
    MSG : What is the project X ?
 Marcer : it's an Game console based on DVD player. And project X is
          under progress by many guys from atari, psx and some others.
          I think it will be a hit. if the price is the right.
    MSG : Will you buy one ?
 Marcer : hmm. hard to say. I will never say never..

    MSG : Well Anything else you want to say to the public ?
 Marcer : Elite is the No1 and we will not leave you guys!
          elite will be with you!
