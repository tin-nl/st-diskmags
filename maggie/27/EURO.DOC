
A "discourse" on European History

   Those who forget history and the English language may be condemned 
to mangle both. Historian Anders Henriksson, a five- year veteran of 
the university classroom, has faithfully recorded his students' more 
striking insights into European history. Possibly as an act of 
vengeance, Henriksson has assembled these fractured fragments into a 
chronological narrative from the Middle Ages to the present.

   During the Middle Ages, everyone was middle aged. Church and state 
were co-operated. Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords,  and 
surfs. After a revival of infantile commerce, merchants appeared. Those 
roamed from town to town exposing them- selves and organizing big 
fairies in the countryside. The Crusades were expeditions by Christians 
who were seeking to free the holy land (the "Home Town" of Christ) from 
the Islams.

   In the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular. A class of 
ycowls arose. Finally, Europe caught the Black Death. It was spread 
from port to port by inflected rats. The plague also helped the 
emergence of English as the national language of England, France, and 
Italy.

   The Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renesance bolted in from 
the blue. Life reeked with joy. Italy became robust, and more 
individuals felt the value of their human being. Italy, of course, was 
much closer to the rest of the world, thanks to northern Europe. Man 
was determined to civilise himself and his brothers, even if heads had 
to roll! It became sheik to be educa-ted. Europe was full of incredable 
churches with great art bulging out of their doors. Renaisance 
merchants were beautiful and almost lifelike.

   The Reformnation happened when German nobles resented that tithes 
were going to the pope, thus enriching Catholic coiffures. The popes 
were usually Catholic. An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a 
church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reori-entation mutation. 
Anabaptist services tended to be migratory. Monks went right on seeing 
themselves as worms. The last Jesuit priest died in the 19th century.

   After the refirmation were wars both foreign and infernal. If the 
Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would have a stronghold 
throughout northern Europe that would include Italy, Burgangy, central 
Europe and India thus surrounding France. The German Emperor's lower 
passage was blocked by the French for years and years.

   Louis XIV became King of the Sun. He gave people food and artillery. 
If he didn't like someone, he sent them to the gallows to row for the 
rest of their lives. Vauban was the royal minister of flirtation.

   In Russia, the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of 
the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes to humor Peter the Great. Peter 
filled his government with accidental people; orthodox priests became 
government antennae.

   The enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltaire wrote a book 
called Candy that got him into trouble. Philosophers were unknown yet, 
and the fundamental stake was one of religious tolerance slightly 
confused with defeatism.

   France was in a serious state. Taxation was a great drain on the 
state budget. The French revolution was accomplished before it 
happened. The revolution catapaulted into Napolean. Napoleon was ill 
with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained.

   History started in 1815. Industrialization was precipitating in 
England. Problems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of a 
population of 1 million people, 2 million able bodies were on the 
loose.

   The middle class was tired and needed a rest. The old order could 
see the lid holding down new ideas beginning to shake. Among the goals 
of the chartists were universal suferage and an anal parliment.

   A new time zone of national unification roared over the horizon. 
Founder of the new Italy was Cavour, an intelligent Sardine from the 
north. Culture formented from its tip to its top. Dramatized were 
adventures in seduction and abortion. Music reeked with reality. Wagner 
was master of music, and when he died they labeled his seat 
"historical."

   World War I broke out about 1912-1914. At war people get killed, and 
then they aren't people any more, but friends. Peace was proclaimed at 
Versigh, which was attended by General Loid, Primal Minister of 
England. President Wilson arrived with 14 pointers. In 1917, Lenin 
revolted Russia.

   Germany was displaced after WW1. This gave rise to Hitler, who 
remilitarized the Rineland over a squirmish between Germany and France. 
Mooscalini rested his foundations on 8 million bayonets and invaded Hi 
Lee Salasy. Germany invaded Poland, France invaded Belgium,  and Russia 
invaded everybody. War screeched to an end when a nukleer explosion was 
dropped on Heroshima. A whole generation had been wipe out, and their 
forlorne families were left to pick up the peaces. The last stage is 
us.

Got that!? - CiH
