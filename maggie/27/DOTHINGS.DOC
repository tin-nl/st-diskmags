A New Demo by Cream..

There was a crew in a distant land who once decided to 'Do Things' with 
their computers.. Some of those things were distinctly musical, as such 
previous efforts as 'Steps' (no, nothing to do with the annoying Abba 
clone group of that name who seem to get a top ten placing every five 
minutes!) 'Things that make you go Hmmm', and of course, the somewhat 
legendary 'CreamSID' player..

Their latest demo, quite a long time in the making, confirms the 
reputation of Cream, and their excellent soundchip musician, Tao, as an 
extremely talented bunch of people..

You might argue that it is 'only' an ST demo, you may suggest that it 
is only really based around variations on a single effect, and ask why 
has it taken them two years to finish it.. I would say that this demo 
is one of the best put together and well designed demos anywhere!

It is an ST demo, but can run on almost anything Atari related, even 
the Pacifist emulator on the PC.. A technical 'first' for this demo, is 
that the majority of it was coded on Pacifist, rather than a raw ST or 
Falcon! (Also a large part of the graphics were prepared with Photoshop 
to save time, an excellent use of the available tools to hand..)

It can run as a classic autobooting floppy disk, it is presented to us 
as an MSA file, but there is a considerately provided TOS executable 
for those of us with hard drives and reasonable (2 MB and above) RAM 
sizes..

I run the demo.. First, an option screen to run the demo, or copy to 
disk, with a background tune, then having decided to get into the 
action, a brief option menu makes sure the Falcon internal speaker 
stays firmly 'off'! The first sign of the demo proper is a brilliant 
sixteen colour loading picture by Agent T, leaving us in 'confusion'!  

The first of many of Tao's wonderful tunes starts up at this point, a 
YM tune, with distinctive SID-like overtones.. A bunch of self-
confident credits stab their way onto the screen, the prequel for the 
first main part of the demo..

This is the 'effect' part of the demo, a wonderful liquid-like swirling 
tunnel plasma, with an almost 3-D feel in some places! Hard to 
describe, wonderful to see in action, and very well interpreted for an 
ST's limited range of colours onscreen.. This is a single effect, but 
with many variations on the theme, all of them wonderful.. More 
credits, and a great number of greetings push to the front of the 
screen to make themselves seen as well..

Just when this part of the demo starts to 'rap', you get the feeling it 
is time to move onto the second part, and give the spacebar a prod.. We 
gratifyingly get another Agent T stunner of a loading screen, with 
another brilliant hand-drawn sixteen colour picture to while away the 
wait for the mid-section of the demo to load..

This is, predictably perhaps, a music selector screen, with around a 
dozen or so Tao tunes awaiting your ears.. This screen as a slightly 
'Cyberpunk' feel in its design.. The first surprise is that these Tao 
Tunes are all SIDchip based! Well maybe not so much of a surprise, if 
you think of it as a logical progression, Cream produce a SIDchip 
player, next step, a SIDchip composer! (So when are the rest of us 
going to get to have a play with this one!? I fancy a shot at being the 
'third worst' SIDchip musician on the Atari scene!)

Banging on the spacebar produces the next item of goodness, an Agent T 
produced slideshow, this seemingly done in some kind of watercolour 
effect (converted from a painting?) and looking confident, self-
assured, and totally brilliant.. A little bit a story along the lines 
of "Loss" in there as well..

Having watched the slideshow, and enjoyed the tunes, you might well 
think that this is all, but there is one final surprise.. Yes, the 
reset demo, first seen in 'Things that make you go Hmmm' makes a return 
visit to this demo as well.. Having perfected a reset routine that 
works on all machines, there was never any sense in Cream keeping it 
for only one demo.. This final part consists of a return to the swirly 
plasma with credits seen earlier, but with more abstract objects 
blended in, such as a Peace symbol, and most stunning of all, a pair of 
eyes, in a 3-D fashion.. Again, the effect needs to be seen to be 
really believed, but it is artistic and understated..

I enjoyed watching Cream 'Do Things', and I'm sure you will too!

Ratings..

Graphix:- 94% - Oh yes, brilliant individual work, and superb overall 
standard of presentation.. This demo reaches new heights of maturity of 
design.. Did I mention this was an ST demo?

Sonix:- 92% - No arguments here either, Some of the very best soundchip 
music for all you soundchip purists and SID fans out there..

Gee-Whiz:- 97% - Let me see now, coded on Pacifist, designed to run 
easily on Pacifist, liquid swirly tunnel plasma thing that I've never 
seen before, original SID tunes by Atari composer, Agent T doing ST 
graphics really well, and a reset demo that damn well works on 
everything too!

Overall:- 95% - One of these things worth doing!

Cream ... do things

Experienced by Richard Davey (rich@atari.org)

Agent T, TAO and Candyman claim that this demo is just intended to be a 
sign of life from Cream. If that's the case, they look very alive 
indeed and their vital signs are strong!

At its heart this demo is essentially one really nice effect, a 
slideshow and an awesome selection of SID-chip music from TAO. But it's 
put together with a certain style and design that enhances its content 
rather than undermine it. The opening effect is really rather 
beautiful, being a combination of plasma tunnels and liquid effects. 
All blend together seemlessly, colour palettes perfectly chosen so as 
to make everything look as smooth as possible; and it works. A quick 
tap of the space bar takes you to an Agent T picture and finally into 
the music selector.

>From here you get to pick from 12 TAO tunes. All of them using his 
newly developed SID routines and all of them really beating the hell 
out of the YM. Music ranges from the slow and trancey "Lost" to an 
almost Japanese offering from "Intensity" and some deep and moving bass 
sounds for "One on One".

The tunes have an almost "digi" feel about them, as if they could be 
soundtracker modules in part. But you know inside it's just a homage to 
TAO's true skill with chip music. There is little point me "reviewing" 
each track as everyone will have their own personal favourite (mine 
being Nostalgia). But rest assured there is some great ear-candy here.

If you press space again while in the music screen, you are taken into 
an Agent T slideshow "somewhere in another world". The pictures all 
lead on from one another to form a story, the style is hand drawn 
almost like a comic book. The story unfolds as a boy finds a strange 
glowing ball in an alley and it progresses to a rather predictable but 
entertaining climax.

In the background TAO struts his stuff of course. There is one last 
treat in store if you hit the reset switch. Some more of Candymans 
great colour swirling effects and a booming TAO tune.

However what is most interesting about this demo are the moral issues 
behind its development. Agent T openly admits to having drawn and 
rendered all the graphics in Photoshop, while Candyman coded the 
majority of the demo using PaCifiST. This in itself has caused various 
discussions on IRC channels, is an ST demo really an ST demo if most of 
it was developed on a PC? It's an interesting question indeed but not 
one which is particularly new to the Atari platform. During its prime 
plenty of the games that came out for the ST had their graphics, code 
and to some extent music ported from the Amiga versions. Those lovely 
raytraced Psygnosis intros for example - some of them crafted on the 
Amiga, others on the PC as time went on.

There is a classic thread throughout the whole of computing showing how 
one machine aided in the development of productions for another, even 
if the end result wasn't even useable on it. It seems that this trend 
has now migrated onto ST demos. I don't hold anything against Agent T 
using Photoshop to get his work done because at the end of the day, 
it's only a tool - just like Degas Elite is a tool. The fact that 
Candyman used PaCifiST to code his demo I think is more a testament to 
the skill of Frederic Gidouin in coding PaCifiST than a derogatory blow 
against Candyman. It's also another firm sign to those who said that 
PaCifiST had/has nothing to offer the "real" Atari world.

But what is the real Atari world now? Not many of us own just an Atari 
machine, some do.. but not all. We live in and around PCs and Macs and 
Amigas as well. The results of the tools on those machines are 
migrating to the Atari. It's almost enevitable, but the issue is should 
we really care? Does it matter how those pictures got into Do Things? 
They still had to be created somewhere, they had to be drawn on a 
computer somewhere. The talent behind them is still the same, 
regardless of their point of origin. And I say it is this that we 
should celebrate.
