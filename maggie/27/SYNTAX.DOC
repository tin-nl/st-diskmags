
Sometimes Bumblebees fly higher than Falcons!

By Syntax

It was a very good year for those Polish warpers of Atari plastic (ST 
flavour!) They followed up their stunning debut demo, with this handily 
titled intro, the only one, I believe. in the '61k' category? For the 
Quast party..

This one is prominently advertised as being an ST demo, runnable on any 
combination of 68000, whether it has an 'F' or 'e' after its name, but 
very happy with the extra power of a 16 mhz STe.. It wouldn't expect to 
run on a Falcon in the normal course of things, but with a bit of 
lateral thinking (and Backward,) it did..

The other good idea is to boot it from a floppy disk, as I have a 
feeling it is in some way allergic to hard drives?

Off we go..

The first bit misleads, a stark 'Warning - No Design!' banner.. This is 
to set the scene for the more critical diskmagascene reviewers out 
there, those conditioned by the German demo scene perhaps?

The illusion stops there though, as the first effect arrives.. it is a 
textured cube, albeit spinning and showing only one face, which happens 
to be the face of the programmer, taken from a school photograph when 
he was eight years old! This effect tends to look less rough on an STe 
over an STFM, suggesting the former machines increased colour palette 
and superior greyscaling is taken into account.. We are then treated to 
some serious distorting, as though invisible forces are trying to tear 
up the photograph..

A slick credit sequence next, with the best fading in and off yet seen 
on an ST, with the high achieving bumblebee (a big version of the mouse 
'busy' sprite) putting in an appearance here..

The cube is back again, but it instantly transcends its previous 
simplicity, by splitting into two differently texture mapped objects, 
and spinning fully on all axis, revealing a proper 3-D system in full 
flow.. If that is not enough, the textures on the cubes start to zoom 
in and out too! A 'must-have' effect assumed possible only on the 
Falcon a few years ago, now brought to the (not so) humble ST! 

The best is next, the nicest looking object in their 3-D repertoire, a 
brilliantly designed 'Atari Cola' can, tumbling end on end.. One to 
keep on watching, at least until the penultimate screen..

This is a 'standard intel object', a multi-coloured torus or 
'doughnut', something less slick, and really looking like a leftover 
object from their previous demo..

The end credits finish off the whole demo nicely, a reprise of the 
super cool fade in/out routines, as the identities of the youthful 
faces mapping the cubes are revealed!

I'm quite happy to report that this latest Syntax effort is well up to 
expectations, and one I enjoyed as much as their previous demo.. The 
coding is spot on, presentation faultless, the music, allegedly by Mad 
Max sounded a little bit 'wrong', but that is my fault for running it 
on a Falcon, which is not quite perfect for full ST sound fidelity..

It would have been great to see them pursue a production on the Falcon 
side (suggested title by me, "Sometimes Falcons fly higher than Pentium 
400's!") after they were offered one after Quast, but like so much 
else, it wasn't to be.. Shame to lose them really..

Ratings..

Graphix:- 90% - Sparse but effective, slickly moving, also makes use of 
STe abilities..

Sonix:- Uum? - Put it this way, if it was a Mad Max tune, it didn't 
sound like any Mad Max tune I ever heard?

Gee-Whiz:- 88% - The 3-D system is not such a surprise as for their 
first demo, but allied with the good looking 3-D objects, STe support, 
neat fade routines etc, this one rocked! 

Overall:- 91% - No sin to tax my brain in here!
