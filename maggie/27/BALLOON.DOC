Cymvention 24hr (ish) games reviewed - Special Report!

In a fit of stretching the  meaning  of  a  24 hour competition to its 
absolute limit, Mr  Pink hit  upon  a  desperate justification for the 
slow arrival  of  these  games,  that  is,  "It's  not  necessarily  a 
concurrent 24 hours in a  row!"  This  sounded like fishing around for 
excuses to us, but no matter,  the  delay in releasing these games has 
been put to profitable  use  with  a  considerable  tidying up process 
taking place in the background, extra graphics bolted on, etc..

Still, the first release out of the starting gates was....


The Stupid Balloon Game by Eddies Cat..  (STe and Falcon '030)

This is a classically simple  game,  apparently  based on some obscure 
piece of ancient arcade heritage  currently  being  emulated on one of 
the multi-arcade emulators on the PC..

The game objective is very simple,  you steer your ball/balloon around 
the screen, which looks  like  a   contour  relief  map  of one of the 
trickier Norwegian Fjords, collecting star  symbols  to gain points as 
you go around.. You have to  take  care  as  if  you touch one of  the 
prickly points of  the landscape,  your  balloon deflates and you lose 
a life.. After three lives, it's all over.. It is all a matter of fine 
control, and people who  are  comfortable  with 'Asteroids' type games 
will be happy with this one.. The  other  game that came to mind was a 
very simplified 'E-Motion'.. Control can either be through traditional 
9-pin crap access to ports style  joystick, or much more user-friendly 
Jagpad..

There is also a pretty  tight  30  second  timer  running as well, and 
failure to complete the screen within that time means a brutal exit to 
the title screen to contemplate  your  misfortune as well.. (Though if 
you do lose a life,  it  does  have  the  happy knack of resetting the 
timer for you!)

The game runs on the  STe  and  Falcon,  it  uses  the DMA hardware to 
replay a bunch of  'Fast  Show'  'Jazzclub'  samples when carrying out 
different tasks, and for one awful  moment,  I was flash-backed to the 
Reservoir Gods ASCII demo from the  previous summer.. The graphics are 
nothing exceptional, but they  are  "Nice!"  and  show  touches of the 
genius of Donkey Island days..

The only minor quibble (intelligent cousin  of a tribble) is that Ed's 
exit routine from this game  is  not  very Falcon friendly, a horrible 
yellow on yellow GEM environment being the  end result.. This is but a 
very minor quibble though, and this 24  hour (ish) game is a credit to 
its creator..

Ratings..

Graphics:- 77% - Simplistic approach, well it is a 24 hour game after 
all.. Still touches of Ed's distinct style in there.. (He draws all his 
own pictures, you know!)

Sound:- 72% - Not a lot of it, but nice use of comedy samples ingame..

Playability:- 80% - Deceptively easy, at first....

Overall:- 78% - Nice one Eddie, let's have another one?!

 CiH - '98
