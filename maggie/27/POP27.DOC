     This issue: That Apparently Scarey Bloke from Marilon Manson

Brief

After public confusion with  Hansun,  Manson  and Shirley Manson, That 
Apparently Scarey Bloke From  Marylon  Manson  was  forced to flee the 
world of 'Satanic Rock'  and  find  new  ways  to persuade the Earth's 
confused youth that the devil is  a  whole  lot better than that other 
Chap.  Now living  in  Salman  Rushde's  spare  room,  That Apparently 
Scarey Bloke from Marylon Manson now plots to distort the universe, or 
failing that, plans to give  Courtney  Love's  Hole a damn good seeing 
to.


SUNDAY 
It's not easy having  different  coloured  eyes.   David Bowie did it, 
yeah, but he had  Alvin Stardust, Ziggy-what-used-to-be-in-Grange-Hill 
and all those freakin' Martian Spiders out to help him, didn't he?

        I could always take the contact lens out.  But that would hurt 
my eye.  I wouldn't like that.

        They don't  understand.   Nobody  understands  me.   But music 
isn't the only way to  pervert  the  world.   Oh  no.  It was only the 
other week I  attempted  to  corrupt  Mother  Nature  herself,  when I 
created a new plant made  from  pepper, plancton, Portugese pineapples 
and frenchmen.

        I planted it among Mrs  Foolhardy's  roses  next door, but her 
dog  wee'd  on  it  and  the  plant  died.   Freakin'  Mother  Nature. 
Freakin', freakin' bitch of a Mother.

        I tried to get that dog  to  assist  in the destruction of the 
world.  I taught it  to  savage  the  footwear  of  all and sundry, by 
beating it with my shoes until  it  hated  even  the sight of them.  I 
trained the dog well, combed it, fed it and freaked it good.

        I then took the hell beast into the city at night and released 
him so that he could travel the  world, biting the feet off anyone who 
got in his way.  It would  take  some  time,  but when my little beast 
reached everyone I would see  results:   A footless world would become 
un-productive and lazy.  Slowly the entire planet would stop traveling 
to work because walking would hurt their stumps too much.  Eventually, 
everyone would stay at home  watching  television  all day and at that 
point, the second part of my plan would come into being.

        I plotted to break into the transmitters of every state across 
the world and take them over with  my team of highly trained ants that 
I had kept in one of those  ant  farms that are basically two pains of 
glass with dirt in the middle, that I had kept since a kid.

        From here  I  would  whisper  very  gently  into  microphones, 
sending subliminal  messages  to  every  person  in  the  world: "Kill 
yourself!  Kill yourself now!"  Resulting  in  the  distruction of the 
entire human race.

        That was my plan.

        Unfortunatly, when I released  the  hell beast, it immediately 
turned round and started champing  at  my feet, stopping occassionally 
to wee on my scarey face and  then  the  ants got out and ate my knees 
off due to me continually ruining their  habitat as a child by shaking 
their ant farm about.

        I nearly died, but didn't quite.


TUESDAY 
Today is a good day  for  destroying  the  world.  Today I returned to 
music as a perfect way of killing  everyone who is alive.  But not, by 
listening to it.  My new way was a lot more sinister.

        I bought an old Bryan Adams CD from a second hand music shop - 
making sure to be very rude to the   boy behind the counter - and then 
took the offensive album home and coated it in arsenic.

        My plan was to lay the toxic CD, face-down, in the centre of a 
shopping mall - at  midnight,  of  course  -  so  that when the retail 
centre became busy the next day, a whole host of people would pick the 
CD up in order to see whether it was worth bagging.

        Of course, the stupid  public  freaker would immediately throw 
the CD down again and rush  off  and  get  food to stop their stomachs 
heaving.  When the  person  buys  their  burger,  hotdog,  sandwich or 
whatever, and put their  hands  to  their  mouth  they would taste the 
arsenic and die instantly.

        At some point in their lives,  everyone in the world may visit 
this shopping mall and be  seduced  by  the  deadly album, not knowing 
it's evil powers, resulting in their  death  and the death of everyone 
on Earth.

        Unfortunatly, because I had to break  into the mall, as it was 
the midnight afteral, a security guard  caught me.  Dazed and confused 
- you know, just like  that  film  about  the  seventies  - I tried to 
whistle to the bats outside for  assistance, but upon doing so, tasted 
the arsenic on my fingers and passed out.

        I nearly died, but not quite.


FRIDAY 
Today is a good day for destroying  the  world.  Today I hatched a new 
plan.  I  paid  a  caretaker  five  thousand  pounds  to  smuggle  the 
blueprints of a toilet roll manufacturing factory out with him when he 
left work, to assist my idea.  This was not strictly necessary, as the 
factory held open  days  for  public  viewing  every  Saturday, but at 
weekends I am usually busy shining  black  shoes as a side-job, so was 
unable to go.

        Once I had the blueprints, I  could break into the factory, at 
midnight, probably through the garbage dump  - you know, like how Luke 
Skywalker blew up the Death  Star  in  Star  Wars  -   and go about my 
deviance.

        I would take with me a huge  barrel of itching powder and pour 
it into the big paper  mache  machine,  so  that  all the toilet paper 
comes out rough and itchy.  After  I had travelled the world, aquiring 
the blueprints of every toilet roll factory on Earth, then breaking in 
and doing the same, the world  would  become  a place of irratance and 
butt-discomfort.

        This would result in the  boycott  of  all toilet paper across 
the planet, leaving  people's  butts  dirty  and  un-wiped, like Greek 
asses.  The  sanitary  and  hygiene  conditions  of  the  world  would 
plummet, causing illness and disease and plague and rats and The Great 
Fire of London.  Eventually everyone would die.

        Unfortunately, the caretaker  took  my  money  and  called the 
police, forcing me to seek hiding  in  my big barrel of itching powder 
when they searched our house.  They got Rushdee, but I was safe in the 
barrel.

        After seven days and six and  a  half nights, I climbed out of 
the barrel and ran onto  the  streets, itching frantically.  A passing 
drugs analyst mistook my state as a post-narcotic frenzy and instantly 
diagnosed me as having heroin  withdrawal  symptons, trying to scratch 
off the beatles that I though were crawling all over me.

        The drugs analyst called the  police, who arrived and labelled 
me a 'cop killer', causing them to  beat me to the ground with assault 
batons for five hours, before my remains escaped down the drain.
        I nearly died, but not quite.


MONDAY 
Today is a very bad day for destroying the world.


WEDNESDAY 
Today I thought of an ingenious  idea  to assist in the destruction of 
the human people.  Remebering something  I  had  learnt  as a child, I 
pasted all of the outside walls and  pavements of our house with honey 
to help attract flies.

        I decided that the best way to kill everyone who isn't already 
dead, is to capture a squadron  of  flies and individually insert them 
into cigarettes, cigars  and  packets  of  potato  chips.   Then, when 
people drag on a cigarette or cigar,  or  eat a packet of potato chips 
the fly will, um, fly into their mouth and be swallowed.

        Afraid that they were housing  an  alive fly in their stomach, 
they would eat a live spider, thinking it would catch the fly once and 
for all.  After that, they would  worry  about the spider - especially 
when it starts to wriggle  and  prickle  and  tickle inside them - and 
form an opinion to swallow a bird to catch the spider.

        In turn, they will continue to  swallow whole, live animals in 
a bid to catch the  previous,  resulting  in  the consumption of cats, 
dogs, cows and giraffes.

        This was a masterplan and when  I walked outside - at midnight 
- I was so pleased to see that our house was covered in flies I jumped 
for joy.  Or should that be bounced for Beezlebub?

        Upon jumping, I lost my  balance  and  fell against the honey- 
coated brickwork of my house, causing  honey  and flies to stick to my 
scarey face.  Spiders scurried from everywhere, getting stuck to other 
honey-dabbed parts of my body,  wriggling  and prickling and tickling, 
as birds swept down to eat the insects and in turn attached themselves 
to my honey body.

        It wasn't long before cats  and  dogs  also got 'stuck up' and 
the sheer weight of a cow on my left arm caused me to loose my balance 
and tumble down a hill, trailing  a  stream of God's creation's behind 
me.  Upon reaching the bottom of the  hill,  I hit a kids BMX ramp and 
was propelled into a nearby field, head-first and screaming, causing a 
grazing horse to get wedged down my throat.

        I thought I'd nearly die, but  I  swallowed the horse and now: 
I'm dead, of course.


Footnote: It has recently  been  revealed  that That Apparently Scarey 
Bloke from Marylon Manson  is  actually  named  Marylon Manson, not at 
birth, but by one of his mates who  was 'off his face' and possibly on 
somebody else's at the time.
