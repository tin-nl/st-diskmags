
~Atari Love!~

You might remember James Ingram who turned up briefly about four years 
ago, in the odd programming related thing for Maggie.. Well he went 
away, but after hanging around the 'Little Green Desktop', found out we 
were still alive, and got in touch, here he is, in his own words..
…
The only people who will be reading this article are people who still 
own and use an Atari machine, or those who own another machine now, but 
are going through a nostalgia stage.  Me?  I fall into both categories: 
my STe sits under my TV and waits for me to play Populous 2, but I now 
use a PC for virtually everything.

But why do we get nostalgic for the ST?  OK, so many of us owned STs 
when we were in our teens, and maybe we're harking back to those Best 
Days Of Our Lives that they were supposed to be.  Maybe we are all 
Northerners at heart, and like to remind ourselves that In The Old 
Days, we Had To Make Do.  But I think there are other reasons as well.

You knew what you had with an ST.  You knew it would work.  You plugged 
it in and switched it on and there you were.  You got a new game, and 
(provided you had enough RAM), you slipped in the disk and booted up.  
I would love to have the same simplicity today.  Sure, my PC can 
produce graphics that make me squeal like a pig in heat.  Yes, the 
music it plays is of CD quality.  OK, so games are more like 
interactive movies than an electronic board game.  But the trade-off is 
that a PC is a lot more hassle.  I plugged in a new 56K modem a few 
weeks ago, and my joystick port decided to die.  There were no IRQs 
left - and this under Windows 95!

When I owned an ST, everything worked (unless a fuse blew).  But most 
of the time, it chugged along reliably and predictably (if slowly).  If 
the ST was a Volvo (boxy, not flash - but reliable) then a modern PC is 
like a Porsche, but without any safety features.  You can be bombing 
along at top speed, when all of a sudden you hit a bump and everything 
flies apart on impact, and you lose everything you were doing.

Another factor is that the ST was a mature machine when I used it 
regularly back in 1994.  What I mean by that is that the programmers 
had got to know the machine and its shortcuts so well, that the games 
pushed the machine to its absolute limits.  And as a result, the games 
were fantastic.  

If a programmer has an idea on a PC, all he has to do is wait for the 
hardware to become available for him to make his idea into reality.  
Unfortunately, this means that games players have to constantly upgrade 
their PCs. It also means, in my opinion, that the programming is more 
sloppy - they don't have to really try a great deal of the time 
(exceptions such as Quake and other ground-breaking games duly noted).  

I remember one of the all-time great games on the ST - "Civilisation".  
I still play that game from time to time (though I traded in the ST 
version for a PC version).  I remember Microprose not wanting to 
release the game for the ST - they didn't feel the user-base was big 
enough.  After a great deal of persuasion and campaigns from magazines, 
they did - to great success (and profit).  Computer scenes stay active 
for a long time after they peak!

The maturity of a machine is something that most people should 
recognise.  Those of us who had a Spectrum back in 1990 will remember 
what the scene was like then - at its full maturity, it produced 
classic game after classic game.  All immensely playable and addictive 
(and they still are, if - like me - you have a copy of the Z80 emulator 
for your PC, so you can play Speccy games at full speed).  Another 
example of a machine which is fully mature is the Playstation.  The 
technology may look dated, but the games being produced for it now are 
phenomenal compared with games for the same platform only 2 or 3 years 
ago.

I don't think the PC will ever reach that level of maturity where it 
can produce an "era" that people hark back to.  Because it is 
constantly getting faster, more colours, higher resolutions, better 
sound and so forth, the limits are never really tested.  A few games 
test the limits once in a while, but when they do, only a few people 
can play them, and by the time everyone else has caught up, they are no 
longer cutting edge.

Of course, there is a solution to the PC problems: buy a Mac.... but 
then you face the dilemma that software houses don't like developing 
Mac software... they don't think the user-base is big enough.  Now 
where have I heard that before....?

And then there's the "first time" thing.  You never really forget your 
first experience of anything.  We all remember our first day at school.  
The first time you ate Sushi, or escargot (yes, I've had both, and 
they're both quite nice - though I prefer snails over raw fish... 
marginally).  We all remember the first time we had sex.  And we all 
remember the first time that we were really bowled over by what a 
computer could do (and, unless you're very strange indeed, those last 
two events are not the same memory).  

Me, I was bowled over by Populous.  It's what I gave up my Speccy for 
(and that's saying something!).  But exactly how far from Populous is a 
game like "Command and Conquer"?  How far from "Xenon 2" is the best 
shoot-em-up you've played?  How far from "Super-Hang On" is the best 
racing game today?  How far from Rainbow Islands is the best platform 
game?  And how far from "F-19" is the best flight-sim?  Sure, they have 
better graphics on a Playstation or a PC, but the concepts and the 
gameplay are about the same.  The list could go on forever, if you 
really stopped to think about it (Elite 2, Civilisation etc etc).

Do I regret leaving the ST scene?  Yes, I suppose I do.  I did at the 
time, even.  But I had to get a PC because I knew my future was in 
programming, and there's only a few opportunities for a 68000 
programmer.

Would I ever leave the PC scene?  In a flash, as soon as a realistic 
alternative presents itself!  So come on, Atari - resurrect yourself 
and give us a new dimension in computing that blows the socks off PCs, 
gives the business world a new direction, and makes Bill Gates 
disappear, sobbing quietly into his hanky.  Most of all, make it from a 
Motorola chip.

A man can dream - can't he?

Bio stuff (if it's of any use to you) 

James Ingram is (and always has been) a programmer.  He coded in 68000 
for 7 years, and has very fond memories of the Good Old Days.  He looks 
forward to having grandchildren, so he can moan at them and tell them 
that in His day, he had real computers.  He will also be able to tell 
them (quite honestly) that he made his own entertainment (some of the 
time).  He is currently working on PCs in the City, using Visual Basic 
5, SQL Server, and all sorts of other nonsense, but he really really 
wants to be paid the same money for messing around in 68000 all day and 
creating Mega-Demos.  Oh, and playing Populous 2.
