                              Chuck Rock

In an attempt to pollute  even  more  of  Maggie with graphical filth, 
here's a new little something I  may  run for a few issues, exploiting 
the end sequences of ST games  you  may  not have completed, or simply 
don't care about.

As well as a great, animated  intro sequence, detailing the snatch and 
grab antics of evil  Gary  Gritter,  Chuck  Rock  has a worthwhile end 
picture too.

Following the graphic  of  the  fallen  end-of-game dinosaur, crushing 
wife-snatching Gary Gritter,  you  are  presented  with  the standard, 
written congratulations screen:


                          "Congratulations!
      Gary is crushed.  I guess he never had the stomach for it.
         Chuck can't wait to get home and out of his leaves.
          And by the look on Ophelia's face, neither can she.
                   Will Chuck ever get his peace."


After shamelessly not putting a question  mark  at  the end of a query 
and a simple review of the high scores, it's back to the front end.

Chuck Rock spawned a sequel,  Son  of  Chuck  and some kind of idiotic 
Mario Kart-induced racer.  Neither saw an Atari release.


This is NOT a funny article.
