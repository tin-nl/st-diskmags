28th of December 1998 - Off we go!
----------------------------------
Woke up this morning feeling a bit  tired.  It was around 6:30 am, and
as you all know, that's a better time for going to bed than for waking
up. But within an hour, I was  on  the train to Arnhem. Once I arrived
there, I found that Comp7 and my  dad  were already waiting for me. We
drove off, and soon we were in the BRR (Bundesrepublik Ruhrgebiet). My
dad made me drive because he was too  sleepy, and Comp7 seemed to be a
bit tired as well. We arrived in Kiel at around 1:30, had a quick bite
at the local McDonald's (McBBQ sucks  like  hell... I'll never have it
again) and then dad left. So  Comp7  and  me  decided to check in. The
lady behind the counter had quite a difficult time with our names, and
the fact that there was supposed to  be a third person present for the
journey (hi TheMatch! ;-))  wasn't  helping  much  either.  I ended up
being mr. Rijn instead of  mr.  van  Rijn.  It  got  me on the boat no
problem though.

Once we had passed through customs,  we  dumped  our stuff in the cosy
little cabin Stena had reserved for  us.  We were amazed by the design
of the cabins, they were  so  wonderfully  orange. We decided the boat
designers must have been influenced by the oh-so well-known 70's style
of Swedish design (don't know how  to  say this in English: lulligheid
ten top). But the table was  just  about  wide  enough to put both the
notebooks  Comp7  had  taken  with   him   on.  One  was  some  crappy
Windoze/Linux machine and the other one was NUT's ST-Book. We listened
to the  non-musician  modcompo  mod's  through  the  Windoze machine's
internal speaker, and  found  that  ALL  entries  sounded crap through
these speakers (even my own! ;-)).

Later that night, we  went  out  to  do  some  serious shopping (beer,
vodka, cigarettes). We tried to have  a  good time at the onboard bar,
but as it seemed that 99% of  the  people in this bar were either over
50 or under 15, we didn't really felt like this was a great night out.
We met a few really  intelligent  girls,  one  of whom seemed to fancy
Comp7. But he didn't do anything about  it and therefore I was allowed
to sleep on a bed  that  night  and  not  on  some couch in the ship's
lounge as I  had  feared  before.  For  some  weird  reason, Comp7 has
misinterpreted this situation and  tells  people  this story the other
way round, but don't be misguided... ;-) She wasn't my type anyway.



29th of December 1998 - Hello Sweden!
-------------------------------------
At around 7:00 am, a  female  voice  started  explaining us why it was
absolutely vital to visit the  supermarket  again. Kicking the speaker
didn't help, and so we were out of bed about half an hour later. After
a quick shower, we went up to  the  lounge and waited for the doors to
open. It took about an hour to  get  through customs, and then we were
in the arrival space.  Comp7  had  agreed  with Matti/NoCrew that he'd
pick us up. It took a few minutes,  but  then we met Matti and we were
off to NoCrew's headquarters. We had  a  little lunch, Matti showed us

some of NoCrew's crazy projects and  then  we  were off to the railway
station in the centre of Gothenburg.

Train prices turned out to be a little higher than expected, and Comp7
was stupid enough not to  lie  about  his  age  (which  cost him a few
crowns extra). I wasn't considered  to  be  a  student because I'm not
Swedish. Now I understand  that  Swedes  think  Dutchmen are lazy, and
that they won't study because they  use  too  much drugs etc. But hey,
all that  might  be  true,  but  I  still  have  to  pay  to  get free
internet... ehhh... an education! So,  my  dear friends at the Swedish
railroadcompany, I am  in  fact  a  student,  and  I  want my discount
&%$##^*&&%!!!!!

A little later, we were in front of  the train, and I quickly smoked a
few more cigarettes. Just before  departure,  Comp7 and Matti left and
we waived goodbye and cried etc. I  got  myself a nice seat, and I was
amazed about the amount of space I  had for my legs. Swedish railroads
might not like students- but  they  sure  do  know  how to make a good
seat! The trip itself was very  entertaining, a good mixture of hills,
forest and lakes was to be  seen.  Somewhere halfway, a friendly Swede
explained me that I could  arrive  in  Stockholm  an hour early if I'd
transfer at Hallsberg. So I arrived in  Stockholm an hour early, but I
didn't have the slightest  clue  where  to  go.  A  few minutes later,
almost everyone who was in the train had vanished, except for me and a
good-looking girl. I decided to ask her if she knew where I should go.
She explained me how to find out  at  which track I would have arrived
if I wouldn't have transferred, and  just  as  we were start to have a
nice chat, her boyfriend came round to pick her up. Bugger. I reminded
myself of the fact that I  was  here  for  Atari and not for women and
walked towards the area  where  I  was  supposed  to  arrive. I waited
outside for a few minutes, and  then  saw  a  big  guy and a small guy
entering the hall. The big one looked a lot like the pic I had seen of
Baggio. But who the heck was  the  small  guy?!  Baggio had told me he
would come to Stockholm to pick me  up alone, and therefore I waited a
little longer. Some 10 minutes later,  no-one had shown up bearing any
resemblance with Baggio, and then I  decided  to  just ask him. It did
turn out to be Baggio, and he  said  he thought it was me outside, but
wasn't sure about it because I  wasn't  expected to arrive this early.
All in all, this took us an  extra hour, and I just as well could have
stayed in the other train after all.  But  what the heck? I was there,
and the party  was  about  to  begin.  We  got  on  the  subway to the
busstation. The bus was there soon  after  we  had arrived. Get on the
bus (not the movie)! Some 50 minutes later on, we were in Norrtalje at
Bagge's place. We had some  good  dinner,  and  then went to Fredrik's
(the small guy) place for a  few  drinks.  After those few drinks, and
after a lot of conversation,  we  went  back to Bagge's appartment and
started up IRC. Evil/DHS was online  as  well,  and the first thing he
asked was if I'm really that  large...  Hey Evil! My old email account
wasn't bigpete@freemail.nl for no  reason!  ;-)))  After that, we went
to sleep.



30th of December 1998 - Downtown Norrtallje
-------------------------------------------
Got out of bed at around 10:00  am. After some breakfast, Bagge showed
me some Falcon demo's which I hadn't  seen before because I don't have
a FPU. Well, after seeing those, I'm sure about having to get myself a
FPU. Bagge offered me his old FPU as  he was about to install a faster
one anyway- thanks a  lot  mate!  First  concern  is  to  get myself a
working falcon again, but this problem has been solved by now as well.
After spending a few hours with this and some lunch, Fredrik picked us
up in his Volkswagen  and  we  were  off  to  get some groceries. I've
learned a few things about Swedish mentality here. First of all, if it
isn't a helluva lot, it can't be  any  good at all. Roast beef's cool,
but buying half a cow  is  somewhat  strange... ;-) Second, quality is
important. It is vitally important to drive around at least an hour if
you cannot find exactly the right  kind  of  saucage for your hot dog.
And after  that, you end up  with  a different brand (but those tasted
great anyway!). Third and  most  amazing  thing  is that Swedish shops
sell products over a month  after  the  sell-by  date has expired. The
chilisauce was good anyway... tasted  great!  We  also went to a place
Swedes call a liquor  store  (Systembolaget),  people  like me who are
used to a more alcohol-friendly environment  call these shops the last
stronghold of Stalinistic  thinking  in  the  western  world.  I mean,
having to wait in line just to buy  a bottle of liquor at a RIDICULOUS
price is quite strange. We got what we wanted though.

After dinner, we were off to  Fredrik's  place again, but first we had
to deliver a bottle of wine  at  Bagge's grandma's place (great you've
brought me this bottle, now I can  at least get drunk tomorrow night!-
cool granny!). We arrived  at  Fredrik's  place,  and the kids started
barbecueing saucages straight away.  They  were  good  :). After that,
Bagge mixed some drink  called  Baggio's  Asskicker (containing vodka,
Red Bull and Sprite). It tasted great,  but  the best drink I had that
night must have been FUN Light-  a  truly excellent softdrink. We will
however sue them for stealing  our  name.  We  had  a lot more drinks,
including Gammel Dansk and a few  other drinks I cannot remember right
now.

Fredrik showed us some of his favourite entertainment- a crazy dude in
a pink trainingsuit applauding for the Swedish king and, dressed up as
a dog, raping innocent  bystanders  in  Disneyland.  He also showed us
another video (some guy dressed as  a cowboy wanking off while another
cowboy was f***ing some  squaw.  During  this  evening,  Bagge and the
other guys told me a lot about  some  old guy who likes to spank young
girls in his house in the north  of  Sweden. This guy had invited them
to come over some time,  and  for  some  reason  they  wanted me to go
along. I kindly refused, but I hope  that  they will have a lot of fun
if they ever have the guts to  go  there on their own ;-))). At around
1:30, we went back to Bagge's  place  and  went to sleep after another
short IRC session.



31st of December 1998 - IMParty starts
--------------------------------------
We woke up at around 10:00am  (I  think) and started packing our stuff
for the party. Jag/DTVM and Tam/TOYS were gonna pick us up in about an
hour, so we had to hurry  a  little.  We had some breakfast (ofcourse)
and then played  some  games  on  Bagge's  Saturn  until  Jag  and Tam
arrived. We crammed all of our  stuff  into Jag's Saab, and then drove
off towards  Graengesbergen. Tam  explained  us  his strange fantasies
(which involve, amongst others, a  lot  of  cash and male organs). The
view from the car  was  amazing  as  usual:  great  forests, lakes and
hills! Along the way, the amount  of  snow increased. Despite what the
dudes told me, it looked a lot like  Santa's world to me. But it seems
that it can get worse. We made a short fuel stop, and later on a there
was a stop because the  kids  (including  all)  felt like throwing big
lumps of icey snow into a  lake-  don't  ask  me why, but it was cool.
Shortly after that, we  arrived  in  Graengesbergen,  and  after a few
quick turns, we found the partyplace. It turned out to be some kind of
kiddies' school, and I must say  that  this was just about the perfect
location for a party this size. The rooms were spacious enough and the
sleeping and sanitary facilities  were  very  good  as well. Nice one,
Imponance dudes! I teamed up with  Comp7  (who  had been at NoCrew HQ)
again, and the party took off.

I talked a lot with a lot of different people during this evening, and
we had a lot of beer. We  went  to  a pizza place in Ludvika at around
22:00, and those people  over  there  seemed  quite  surprised and not
prepared for some 20 hungry Atarifreaks. We  had a good laugh with the
Finns- they understand very little  Dutch,  but  hey! They were asking
for it... At 12pm all went  outside  and some guys lit some fireworks.
One piece of firework  almost  wiped  out  half  of  the current Atari
scene- but nobody seemed  to  really  care  about  this  :). After the
fireworks were over,  we  all  got  back  inside  quickly. Poker games
started, a lot of IRC'ing was  going  on  and  we had a very good time
indeed. NUT was online, and some other Dutch guys as well, it was cool
to hear some news from good  old Cheeseland. I cannot remember exactly
everything   that happened during the  night  because I was either too
drunk or too disoriented (or  maybe  (?!)  both).  At around 6:30am, I
decided to hit the floor and that was it for the day.



1st of January 1999 - Party On!
-------------------------------
Got out of my  sleepingbag  at  2:00pm.  I  first  got myself into the
showers- excellent! Lots of hot  water  was  what I needed right there
and then. I somehow managed to  miss the shoppingtrip, and therefore I
didn't have breakfast. Thank God  Loke/DHS  was  willing to take me to
the supermarket. We got ourselves some  highly needed groceries, and a
little bit later we got back  to  the  party. Lunch was excellent, and
thereafter business got serious. Baggio  asked  me to do some graphics
for their new ST demo (you will  surely  see the results at EIL) and I
started experimenting a little bit with  that right there and then. At
the end of the party, I managed  to  finish just one texture, but more
were to follow. I  got  a  quick  peek  at  NewBeat's FlexTrax, a very
promising tracker with realtime DSP  effects (has been released now...
get it!). Several other people/groups  were  coding on their releases,
and a most of them looked excellent to me.

I had  dinner  at  around  8:00pm,  together  with  Setok  and NoRing.
Ofcourse it  was  at  the  pizzaplace  again,  but  this  time  it was
Graengesbergen's local pizzeria instead of  the  Ludvika one. Food was
quite ok, and the prices weren't that high either.

Later in the evening, NUT was  online  again and he had a semi-working
version of a certain intro on his harddisk. Comp7 downloaded it and we
started wondering whether or not to  release this intro. The music was
fucked up, but  whatever  we  tried,  it  didn't  work  out.  We had a
complete 4 channel .dtm file,  which  sounded  the  way it should. But
there doesn't seem to any way at all to convert this type of file to a
standard .mod file. We (assisted by  various  people) tried to use any
thinkable way of conversion, but it  was simply impossible. Maybe this
is a good idea for a bored coder?  It can never be too hard... DTM and
MOD file formats are very much alike. We  found a way to convert it in
the end- but I won't recommend this method to anyone (find out more in
the rest of this article).

A little while after this,  the  results  of the non-musician modcompo
were announced. It was quite cool to see Evil working and counting and
announcing. Unfortunately, the voters did not seem to have an adequate
knowledge of good music, and therefore  I reached 3rd place. It's also
possible that  this  3rd  place  was  intended  as  some  kind  of  an
encouragement for me to try  and  create  more  modules. I don't know,
maybe I will do some more  in  the  future.  But only if people really
want me to! ;-) Compowinner turned out  to be Evil. The main prize was
a problem though, Evil didn't  feel  like  giving  himself a beer, and
just before he burst into tears, I  threw  him a can of Beck's... That
saved his day (I hope) :).

During the 'big-men-play-poker' game later that  night, I got my first
taste of 'snus', a  Swedish  tobacco  product  that  you have to stick
under your lip. Several people had warned  me before I tried it, but I
actually liked it!  After  seeing  the  pictures  of  a  famous German
trackermusician who had just tried  it,  and  having heard the stories
about this, I had  my  doubts  about  the  safety  of this experiment.
Especially since the  Swedes  tried  to  scare  me  all  the time with
stories about dizziness,  puking  and  other  bad  things.  But 'snus'
turned out to be quite a  light  experience,  worst thing about it was
the taste when you remove  the  package. Hey dudes, Dutch chainsmokers
aren't that easy to impress! ;-) We had some more beers, a lot more of
talking and at around 6am, I collapsed on my sleepingbag.



2nd of January 1999 - The Beginning of the End
----------------------------------------------
I woke up late in the afternoon,  and  after a quick shower I was back
on the job of pixelling. A  little  bit  later  I had some brunch, and
then I heard some  rumours  about  Agression  releasing parts of their
unfinished demo. I was able to take a quick peek at what they had been
doing, and the effects were quite  awsome to say the least, expecially
if you remember that they're a  few  years old already. The Impressive
Spice Boys were busy finishing their  nonmusician musicdemo, and I can
remember that they were being helped by some other dude as well.

Some of you have been complaining  that  it  took Wildfire such a long
time to release their Immortalize demo.  I  can tell you for sure that
one of their members' clumsyness *must* be  the reason for this. If it
takes you about seven tries to put a  pixel at the spot where you want
it to be, things are bound to  take  a  long time. So I volunteered to
take his job (it didn't feel  right  to leave him there so helplessly)
and I quickly finished the menu he wanted  to  do. You can see it in a
certain demo of which you  do  NOT  want  to  hear the sound. (No more
clues here, this might damage my reputation even further...)

Later on, we went to  the  pizzaplace  again  for some dinner. We were
with about six and I picked  the  kebab  this time. It wasn't too bad,
but doesn't come anywhere near to ye  olde Dutch shoarma (at least, in
my opinion). I almost ordered a beer, but I was just in time to change
my mind when I remembered that it  would've been a 3.5% one. One thing
must be mentioned here: no-one in Europe knows what real mayonaise is,
except for the Dutch.  This  wasn't  really  awful,  but not that good
either. A bit like Opel/Vauxhall cars I'd say.

Somewhere in the night or early  morning,  me  and Comp7 got the crazy
idea to solve our  dtm->mod  problem  by  just  copying  all notes and
positions by hand. So that's  what  we  did,  and  it turned out to be
quite good. But this process made us sure about not wanting to do such
a thing ever again. It took a long time, was very hectic and we didn't
really know what to do with the mod at all, to be honest.

I had been thinking about going to sleep all through the night, but by
the time I had finally decided to  do  it, it was already too late and
it didn't make any sense anymore. We were gonna leave at 10am the next
day anyway, so what use is  sleeping  at  around  7am? Not very much I
think... So I skipped sleep this night.



3rd of January 1999 - Imp8 is over
----------------------------------
At just a little bit after 9am, Jag woke up and was packing his stuff.
Me and the other guys in the car (Tam and Bagge) soon followed him. At
around 11am, everything was ready to go.  I was busy for about half an
hour with saying goodbye to everyone. On  one hand, I was tired enough
and felt like sleeping in a  normal  bed  once again, but on the other
hand, the atmosphere during the party had been really really great and
this made me reluctant to leave.  Jag  got the Saab running again, and
so we really had to leave. During the trip back to Norrtalje, I missed
most of the beautiful forests, lakes  and  hills because I was asleep,
and so were Baggio and Tam. Somewhere  halfway, we had a quick bite at
the McDonald's. Then we got back in the car, and I dozed off again.

I woke up when we had  already  entered Norrtalje, and a little later,
we were carrying all our stuff back  into the appartment. After we had
finished that, Jag and Tam left and  Bagge  and me decided to rest ie.
sleep after a shower and some food  and drinks. We had dinner later on
(which was excellent once again)  and  then  we  went to sleep for the
last time this day.



4th of January 1999 - Travel Travel Travel
------------------------------------------
Baggio woke me up at  around  6am,  and  I  started  to check if I had
packed all of my belongings  once  again.  We  had some breakfast (not
again...) and then we were just in time to catch the bus to Stockholm.
We took the subway to the railway station, and as my train was already
there, Baggio and me  splitted  up  a  bit  abrupt. Maybe also because
Bagge was longing to get back  to  his  bed, I don't know... ;-))) The
train trip was very entertaining as  usual-  a lot of inspiring lakes,
hills and forests this  time,  something  I  didn't  expect. Thank God
there were some good-looking  females  in  the compartiment this time,
and this made the trip a little less boring.

I arrived in Gothenburg at around 14:45pm, and as there was still some
time left, I decided  to  check  out  the  big  mall  they have there.
Grabbed a bite at McD's, but  nothing  much had changed there since my
last visit (about one and a half  year  before). So I took the tram to
the ferry terminal (if you  ever  need  it:  it's near the stop called
Chapman's Torg). After I had checked in,  I called home to announce my
return. Then I went to my  cabin,  bored  myself together with the two
German dudes who also were in  the  cabin,  went to the supermarket to
buy some 'snus' as a present for  my mates back in Holland and visited
the incredibly dull 'nightclub-whatever-it-is'  thing. At around 12pm,
I got back to the cabin, chatted  a  little more with the German dudes
and then went to sleep.



5th of January 1999 - From Kiel to Venlo for 20DM
-------------------------------------------------
Stena Line had introduced a new  customer  policy for the return trip,
this involved NOT opening the supermarket  on  the day of arrival. Bad
thing about this was that  they  started  announcing  this fact at 7am
anyway, and kicking the speaker once again  didn't help much. So i was
on my feet at around 7:30am,  had  a  quick  shower, got myself to the
lounge and waited to get off board.  Customs took a bit less time than
it did in Gothenburg, and after I had left the terminal, I went out to
look for the railway station. It wasn't  that far away, and soon I was
talking to a friendly lady  about  the  cheapest  way to get from Kiel
back to Holland. First plan was  to  cross  the border in the north of
Holland, but since  this  involved  stopping  at  a  few youth-plagued
villages (hi  Teenage!)  I  decided  to  get  myself  a  train  to Bad
Bentheim, near Enschede. The regional  train  ticket  was only 20DM, I
never expected to travel  this  cheaply!  Anyone ever going to/through
Germany on a  low  budget  should  seriously  consider  buying  such a
ticket. It might take you a while to  go where you want, but it's VERY
cheap indeed.


Downside was that I had to  wait  some  one  and a half hour before my
train would depart. As I expected a  lot less hills, lakes and forests
this time, I  decided  to  buy  myself  something  to  read.  I picked
'Ecstacy' from the bookshop  and  it  turned  out  to  be an excellent
choice, it kept me reading almost all  the  way through the rest of my
journey that day. I left Kiel at  around 11am, had 45 minutes stops in
Hamburg, Bremen and Osnabrueck, and I arrived in Bad Bentheim at a few
minutes before 6pm. My mother was  already  there  to pick me, and she
drove me to Arnhem, where I got myself  on the train (for free :)) and
I was back in Venlo at around  9pm.  When  I got back to my house, the
other dudes were there like  always  before  (smoking some shit on the
big couch ;-)) and I chatted to them for a few minutes before going to
sleep.



Epilogue or something alike
---------------------------
First version of this story was started  about a week after I returned
from Imp8. It was lost  during  a  Windows  fuck-up a few weeks later.
Then I rewrote the story using a printed copy I found a few days later
somewhere under  a  pile  of  schoolbooks.  I  sent  this  version  to
MaggieHQ, and thought everything  was  ok.  Until yesterday (18/3/99),
when I accidentally mentioned it to  Mr.  Pink,  who said he had never
seen the article.  In  the  meantime,  the  article  had  been lost in
another Windows fuck-up. So I quickly  rewrote the entire story, using
no more than my (buggy) memory and  a version of the story (concerning
just the first few days) I  found  on  a floppy somewhere. I hope this
explains why the story is a lot  shorter  than it was in it's original
form, but I simply do not have  the  time right now to type more. :(((
And I must also admit that  I  can't  remember  a lot of details right
now, they're still somewhere in my head but I simply cannot find them.
Therefore, I tried not to use names  as  often as I would've wanted. I
won't greet any of the Imp8  partydudes  by name, because I'm too much
afraid of accidentally forgetting about some  of those cool dudes I've
been talking to. Sorry, but hey dudes! We had a great time, didn't we?
I'm already thinking about how  I'm  gonna  go  to Imp9 this summer...
Hope i can make it!



Extra mega thanks must go to:

Imponance (for organizing the party- good job!)
Comp7 (for the tickets and the talk- had a cool time!)
Matti (for showing us around Gothenburg  and assistance at the railway
station- thanks mate!)

and last but not least (and again, btw):

EVERYONE WHO MADE IMParty8 THE SUCCESS IT WAS!

Had a great time, hope to see you next time!



Havoc/FUN 19/3/1999
