
- The Staffordshire Atari Show Realtime Text! -
 
This was written  at  the  All  Micro  Show  in  Stafford  on the 14th 
November 1998, and is a realtime record  of what was said in the heat, 
or rather, the cold of  the  moment  there..  We  are grateful to Matt 
Smith for donating his PC laptop  to  the cause.. This realtime should 
be taken as read, and if you want anything more informative, then read 
the main show report, if  you  haven't  already done so.. Apologies in 
advance for  any  colourful  language  that  might  crop  up  in here, 
especially in the latter end of  the  article.. 

 - CiH - 21st November 1998


Staffordshire Show Realtime thing is now open!!!!


09.34hrs...

It is cold, so cold, as winter  strikes  deep into our bones... CiH on 
the keys opening proceedings here on  another  weird  portable PC 
thingy.. Also standing up as there is a deep lack  of  chairs so far... 
The County Showground at Stafford (Bingley Hall) is very large  and  
echoey, also the only heat source comes from the hand  dryers  in  the  
toilets..  The  show hasn't even opened yet, but I've already scored a 
major bargain, I'll tell you a bit more about it later..

Handy hint no 1, Don't forget  to  hit  'enter'  at  the end of a line 
otherwise you'll ramble on and on..

This place has atmosphere, very cold atmosphere!


09.45hrs..

Success with the chair finder  general,  there  are some hiding by the 
main entrance, for any other exhibitors reading  this, it'll be too 
late by the time you get there hahahahaha!

A little note on this finger-freezing  journal on what has happened so 
far.. We were up unfeasibly early, an hour  earlier than we needed to 
be, as Felice (The great communicator!)  decided  to  set  off  an  
hour  later than initially suggested.. The rest of us got up at 5am 
though !!!!!


09.49hrs..

Presently Felice and Pete  A.  are  missing,  myself,  Nickie and Matt 
Smith are keeping an eye on things..

Stuff scheduled to happen today..

Mr Pink turns up with the new  Godboy  X  game Zelda.. At least one or 
two other new games, (Michigan Mike  II?),  Arnel  turns up, Taff turns 
up, Tat!?!

Tat???!!!?!!?!?!!?

Matt Smith complains that  I'm  doing  this  single  handed, well he'd 
better start banging in some test himself then!!


09.52hrs..

Someone has put the fire on at last..

<Matt Smith> takes over the keyboard. MMmm lovely heat at last. 
The doors have opened and people have started to arrive. All the 
Falcons on the stand are running, but I'm a plug socket short and 
have to keep unpluging my CD Rom to use the external hard drive.

The quest to find a 2 way adapter will soon be underway after I 
get something to eat.. I'm starving


09.58 hrs

Well, here at last - great venue but a little bit cold, still, hope we 
can get rid of all this junk we seem to have accumulated ..... Felice.

Forget about the bacon roll, there is no way I'm paying #2.00 for a 
piece of bacon the size of a bit of string in a roll that looks like 
it was trodden on. How about their breakfast special, 6 items for 
#4.50, yeah great... I bet 4 of those items where beans. Still no 
luck with a 2 way adapter 8-(  Matt

        Who's that weird Rich bloke then? :)


10.28hrs..

Food and drink somewhat overpriced, but  we've still got the odd Wagon 
Wheel on standby (Capt Scott of the Antarctic, snacklog journal entry)  
Also some other food so we're not too worried..

 **CiH buys another Falcon shock!**

This is what you might call  exhibitors  privileges, as I was sort of 
semi looking for a spare  machine  as  my  main  Falcy  is showing 
signs of impending senility.. It happened that the Floppyshop stand was 
opposite ours, it also happened that they had a  rather  nice Falcy in 
a desktopper case for 250 UKP (Why doesn't this thing support pound 
signs?)

Steve Delaney was delighted  to  make  the  sale  even before the show 
opened, exhibitors privileges, get the best stuff before the punters 
do!!!

If anyone is reading back on  this  at  the show, Floppy shop are also 
doing a nice PowerMac for 450 UKP, but that'll  have  gone by the time 
you get there, harharharhar!!


10.57hrs..

What, no-one added anything here.... Mr Pink, Rich Davey (Requiem) and 
Jon Nott (Vogue) have turned up,  Requiem  has  lost a lot of hair but 
gained a bit of weight.. Vogue  has  opted  for  the 'Shaggy from 
Scooby-Doo' look and no longer looks like a fifteen-year old..

Off to have a bit of a look around.. CiH

Check out the Atari Computing stand... free sweeties, but still a poor 
substitute for real food. I buy a copy the Renegade CD Rom for 14 ukp 
and will review it in the next Maggie. - Matt


11.30hrs.

Hello! Carbon here, just  bought  some  atari's  and  a  nice big hard 
drive. hehehe, 

Atari Rules, pc are just sad.

Carbon suggests flashing a bit more :)

Quote of the day from Pete as he tries to flog someone a piece of 
hardware..  'I've spent more than 200 pounds on a whim'

What's a whim.. is it something you use on a PC ? - Matt 8-)

I think therefore I AM.


12.10 hrs

Del boy and Rodney a.k.a. Felice and Pete have shifted loads of stuff 
and have now got enough money to buy a bacon roll.

The show costs 2.00 to get in  so  it  isnt bad but they must get lots 
out of it I don't know how much it is to put a stool here but people 
are selling things like its free .oh well got to go.

(Who was that? He left no name? Okay, it's probably Matt - Ed)


13.05hrs..

Taff is here!!!!

Also Tat turned up as well,  only  looking a bit more dishevilled than 
usual Malc and kev too, all are fine..

Apart from the obvious  Atari  and  PC  stuff,  there  are some crusty 
relics from the 8-bit scene, a large QL presence, but not showing 
anything really amazing, but the QL  scene  was  always  a  bit 'dad-
serious', also an Einstein user group which is just plain 'Dad'..

Shittiest hardware has to be either  the horribly stained Amstrad 1640 
PCs, or the wrecked BBC Masters with  Gwent  County  Council markings 
all over them..

Must have recovered them from the bin? - CiH


13.10hrs...

The Taff man is BaACK Hurrah...... And I still cannot type  :(


Shit, it's still 1:10! 

VoGue here .... don't ask me why!  Just there's this ickle laptop here 
and realtime article  fever  is  calling  ;)  I'm  here  with  Requiem 
and Aengus.. and we've brought shitloads of stuff, even though we 
haven't got any cash. Strange finances, eh? Looks like  a  kind  of 
RG/IRC meet is imminent, but we need to go and get loaded (???)... C'ya


13:15..

Well it took Jon 5mins to think  of what to write there. Inspirational 
huh? This is Rich D  typing  away  about  half-way  through  a good, 
rainy, hectic, tiring day! This show is kinda cool..  you  can get all 
kinds of stuff on the cheap and  then  go  outside  and  play  with  
the sheep!  Awesome country living.  Good to see a ton of  familiar  
faces here (and some new ones too) even if they do look an  extra  year  
or  three haggered :)  Masses of hardware is strutting itself around in 
all its GEMified glory, Hades, Milan, Titan enhanced Falcons and more. 
Yet  strangely its the boxes of Atari ST bits and pieces  that  garner  
the  most  interet  :)   Long  live the Atari!!! yeah yeah yeah :)  
We've totally  run  out  of money now, have a truck load of books, CD's 
and other stuff - Felice is STILL trying to sell his Acorn Archimedium 
thing on  my  left,  he's  haggled  with  a bunch of people so far but 
none have got beyond  the  "Arc what?" phase. If he manages to get 80 
quid for it I'll be bloody amazed. Chris - keep us posted ;) Okay.. 
someone else continue this shit ;)

Aengus here...I've just added to  Rich's  and John's misery by getting 
the the only copy of ST internals...haha ;)


1:26

Well, suck on it AJ, I got Devpac 3 + manual :):):) Rich has now dived 
onto a nearby Falcon... He must ve having withdrawal symptoms (well, I 
have had his '030 for a few years now). Guess he'll have to wait for 
WinPCST030 (!). Hey, if you're reading this  on  the  Little  Green 
Desktop - don't ya just love my conversion. We still have no money, I 
guess that venture is on hold for now.


1:33

Yeah..ok, so you got Devpac  3.  Swine :) Money....damn...where did it 
all go??


1:45

1.45?? Shurely 13.50hrs!!

CiH back again, Taff  looms  and  casts  a  shadow  of doubt over this 
enterprise..

There are also  one  or  two,  well  shall  we  say,  *slightly* legal 
ventures at the show, something called a Playstation  chipping kit is 
on sale, and I don't think this is meant to allow  certain  Dead  
Hackers music demos to be used on that console somehow!!!


13.55hrs..

Carbon of Reject is also in  the building, confirming his Tronic-esque 
return to the Atari, we all cheer loudly, or is it indigestion?

Requiem and Vogue hang around for far too  long, but if I can get them 
back on here???

Felice and Pete are mildly  celebrating,  but  all  the big stuff, the 
Archimedes and the spare monitor have stayed  stubbornly stuck to the 
stand, with the fact that there is a desktopper Falcon  coming home 
with us, there may be *more* stuff going back with us than came down in 
the first place..

Still, if the food is going to be uneaten, I'll throw that away, might 
make a little more space..

Felice's 'VGA monitor for a fiver' is really an EGA monitor..

CiH, passing the buck to someone else.....

...oh thanks! (VoGue)


2:00 (VoGue)

Well, CiH has kinda  kicked  me  off  his  Falcon  after I was failing 
miserably trying to read disk magazines  written in strange 
languages...  What's wrong with English you freaks ?!!  (sorry  for 
insulting everyone outside of the UK there ;O) ) Arse, this writing 
thing ain't working.. C'ya l8r..

New entry: Whiplash Whitehouse 
So far, I have bought a copy of  Epic  on the ST from this very stall, 
and am still looking for a decent priced and good Jag game. The show 
has been a blast. All my  fellow  Atarians  are  really  friendly,  and 
know what they're talking about. My brother's now  playin'  Running  on 
the falcon. Kewl game! Bysies!


14.22hrs..

Just sorted out Chris Crosskey, teaching  his Falcon to play MODs, now 
it's an argument between him and  his  sound  system, I'm keeping well 
away from that one!! - CiH


14.25hrs..

Apart from a certain Falcy which  was  snapped up very early, and some 
level of interest in the Milan, there seems to be not too much movement 
of hardware from the majority of stands, I'm waiting 'til it gets to 
the 'Three for a fiver' stage, which will  probably be any time after 
3.00 o'clock.

Software seems to be shifting quite well though..

I gather that I've  beaten  a  few  people  to  the Floppyshop Falcon, 
greets in that regard to Requiem (Rich Davey) (tee hee!) - CiH

Milan's rule! - AM.


14.30hrs..

A long day already, sold some Jag  games  and other bits & pieces - no 
interest in the Arc  though,  looks  like  that'll  be  making  a  trip 
to Cash Convertors in Cambridge :( - Felice.


14.40hrs..

Dodgy .MOV files on Matts  Falcon,  something  like 'Michael Jackson - 
Undead Bloodsucker' - When Michael was  eight  years  old  and hadn't 
had any surgery or skin-whitening.. (And was  actually  a  little  boy,  
as opposed to being very interested in little boys!!) - CiH

Yeah, funky affro!!  - Matt

Made some friends and found  some  bargains,  but  I'm losing my voice 
now, so I'll type everything :) - AM.


15.10 hrs

The crowds are starting to thin out now, loads or stands are virtually 
giving stuff away. I'm off to hunt out some real bargains.

Hello, Simon 'Carbon' Osborne here! Well, to tell you the truth, I am 
near enough skint. I've bought some Atari stuff, and I am getting happy 
:)

I know, let's rename this file to AUTOEXEC.BAT then we can do a FORMAT 
C: 
hehehe 
I want to KILL this PC :) HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Ahem......


15.50 hrs..

CiH giving this realtime a much-needed break from the genius of Carbon 
of Reject, sounds like the show trying to close twenty minutes early..

Looks like Felice's VGA/EGA  monitor  has  left  the building, but the 
Archimedes is sticking limpet-like to  us,  although  there  was  a 
little bit of interest.

Message to the organiser bloke on the public address system

SHUT THE F*CK UP!!!!


15.55hrs

Organisers getting shirty, vans with  mobs of strong-armed riot police 
to follow?

MSG.rg hey there...time to go...and rave... :) obviously not...time to 
go somewhere some where...where do  we  go...Tat  + Mrp and 
Sh3...fucking rul3z... fuck yeah,,,,... I hope this isn't censored...


1600 hours

The show has closed and the organisers as busy evicting the last few 
people who can't find  the  exit..  PC  owners probably. This realtime 
article is going to sleep for a  while,  it  will  soon re-appear at 
the after show party. - Matt


1650 hours

After a lot of confusion, we're finally at the after show party. Well, 
not we just me <Matt>.  The  others,  CIH,  Felice  &  co have gone in 
search of a newsagents to but lottery tickets. They are destined to 
show up sooner or later.


17.00hrs..

Pub life, tralala pub life!!! - CiH


17:10

The sandwiches finally arrive, and they're free... yum yum

yum yum? when have free sandwiches ever tasted of anything 
other than processed chicken ?

When they haven't got chicken in..

Strange people are wandering around outside  the party - either to try 
and scare us or because they're lost - or both !


17:25

It walks in (Joe that is !)

11:14 Utah

MouseBursters..... now he has to drive a hundred miles or so home.

way home :-))

Chris C is gonna get his ass kicked = Sgt Bash

Errm, yeh, great party this is turning out to be.....


18.00 (!?!? - Ed)

yep, certainly is a great party, good  show  as well, even if it was a 
tad cold earlier on - good venue too. Let's hope Joe organises the ACC 
part for next time ;))

Felice.


Due to lager induced paralysis  the  Maggie  realtime article is going 
mobile as nobody has been able to walk over to this laptop and type 
anything. The music starts and the laptop is  passed  round in a pass 
the parcel type fashion. When the music stops....you get the idea.  
 - Matt

mr pink here... i am quite drunken 
pc keyoards are shit compared to the good old atrai 
look out for the new version of zelda on the godboyx 
no tiger bitter here unfortunately but we are chilling out 
in the 'chillout' zone.... 
comedy joke of the day

to...

people with bad jokes, terrible...now  sh3  and  Mrpink are having big 
fight about nothing...tut tut...oh well dum de dum... time to pass this 
shit on to someone who actually cares !


Another joke from  Arnel  this  time.  Apologies  in  advance  for any 
offence.

Paddy, from southern Ireland,  was  shopping  in  Dublin  one day, and 
spotted something interesting in a shop window, and went inside.

"So what's that thing there in dat window?"

"Why, thats a Thermos Flask, for  sure.  It  keeps hot things hot, and 
cold things cold."

"Jaysus that's brilliant! I'll take one with me right away."

So the next day Paddy was  back  at  work  and his workmates asked him 
what it was he had with him.

"Why it's a Thermos Flask.  It  keeps  hot  things hot and cold things 
cold."

"Jaysus that's fantatsic. So what ya got in der then?"

"Two cups of tea and a choc ice"


19.01hrs..

CiH signing off, tata!!!!

        clr.w -(a7)
        trap #1

bye! tat

SH3 = Shit Head 3 :) 
I think therefore I AM. going - AM.

Carbon says="Bugger"

Bye bye everyone, bye bye.

I used to be into necrophilia and beastiality 
but I think I'm flogging a dead horse  - Matt

And with that my  fine  friends  this  real  time  article draws to an 
abrupt and lager stained end. It's half past 7 at night, pitch black 
outside and we're in the middle  of  nowhere.  Getting  home  this side 
of the Millenium seems unlikely if we don't all make a move now.
…

- End! -
