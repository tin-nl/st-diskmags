
MOVIES IN 1998


After many years (since the end of the 1980's, in fact) when all 
good movies were only released on video in limited numbers, it 
has been nice during 1998 to see some top movies at the cinema in 
Cambridge.

Movies that tend to grab the public imagination (eg Titanic) have 
unfortunately tended to be crap, however, since the release of 
that infamous film, there has been much generally better stuff 
also released.

One of the first movies I got to see was 'Good Will Hunting' - 
starring Matt Damon & Ben Affleck. Written by both actors as well 
- neither of them had been heard of before this movie was 
released - this, in my opinion, has been the movie of '98. You 
may well have seen the review in Maggie 26 (if you haven't, read 
it !). Also starring the lovely British actress, Minnie Driver, 
who was last seen in the pretty good 'Circle of Friends' some 
years back on video, the movie itself was funny, sad and yet held 
our interest for the whole time it was playing. In actual fact, 
Matt & Ben, along with Robin Williams (best actor), won an Oscar 
for the screenplay in 1998, well deserved in my opinion.

Matt Damon, in fact, has been involved with a fair amount of 
other movies since 'Good Will Hunting' - he also took a role in 
'Saving Private Ryan' - Steven Spielberg's legendary film about 
the Normandy landings and what happened afterwards. This 
particular movie is reviewed in this issue of Maggie in a 
separate article - either above or below another review by CiH.

A more contemporary drama role was taken by Matt in the long-
awaited movie version of John Grisham's excellent bestseller 
book, 'The Rainmaker'. The story of a rookie lawyer trying to 
survive, taking on an interesting case (amongst others) involving 
an insurance company and their denial of benefit to a lad who 
developed leukaemia, despite his paying into their insurance 
scheme after he left school.  The movie itself was very touching, 
and, whilst in itself it was fiction, life in itself in the world 
of the US lawyer has mirrored this with a recent case breaking at 
the moment. News of this has been sketchy - no reporting on BBC 
whatsoever - but on CNN and NBC the case has been compared to 
that in the book.

The Rainmaker is now available on video, and should also be on 
sellthru - exrental - very soon, possibly early 1999. It is worth 
hiring if you haven't yet seen it - and I am sure you will want 
to purchase it later on.

Other movies I have also seen this year include 'Deep Impact' - a 
good movie about what could happen if a rock from space landed in 
the ocean, made by the team that brings us ER;  - 'Armageddon' - 
along similar lines, 'Lost in Space' - an updated movie version 
of a classic TV series. The acting was pretty good in all of 
these, with one or two standing out. One of the younger 
actresses in 'Lost in Space', Lacey Chalbert, is one to look out 
for in the future - she was very funny in this particular movie.

Kurt Russell - who became famous through his roles in 'The Thing' 
and 'Tombstone' - amongst other movies, was in a tense thriller 
called 'Breakdown'. This was OK, nothing special, worth a watch I 
guess.

One of the more surprising characters to make a comeback was the 
killer doll, Chucky, from the 'Child's Play' series of movies. We 
all initially thought that, particularly after the furore over 
the murder of James Bulger back in 1993, how, if such a movie was 
made, would it ever be released here or not. Well. 'Bride of 
Chucky' - as the movie is known - did very well in the US at 
Halloween of 1998. It'll be released here on the 'Metrodome' 
label sometime in June. However, it'll also be interesting to see 
what our infamous tabloids make of the return of Chucky.

Directed by Ronny Yu (from Hong Kong), Bride of Chucky features 
the voice of Brad Dourif as Chucky, along with Jennifer Tilly and 
a number of other cast also involved. There is, apparently, a 
reference to the Bulger case here in England, when, on being 
asked if he had killed a lad called James, Chucky quite plainly 
says he didn't. All in all, it should make for an interesting 
release on video later this year.  I guess it'll be reviewed here 
in Maggie at some stage shortly afterwards.
