The 'After Quast' version..

by Mystic Bytes!

The Mystic Bytes Quast entry blasts onto your screen in a hyperactive 
frenzy! No time to sit back and relax watching this one..

Starting the proggy gives you a little bit of a wait, whilst various 
parts are initialising and sorting themselves out.. The wait is made 
bearable by a characteristic 'MB' ASCII logo.. This is the only bit of 
the demo where you get to wait, so make the most of this 'lull before 
the storm' of multiple effects..

A frantic soundtrack blasts in, your heart-rate is up to three hundred 
beats per minute in sympathy, and what looks like a spider knot trying 
to untie itself writhes onscreen.. (Interested people note.. The demo 
runs in overscan, the screen edges flash, this may or may not be 
deliberate?)

The stillness of the high resolution high coloured 'Mystic Bytes' fancy 
logo is in stark contrast.. We are not asked to cope with this much 
stillness for long though, as a shudder announces the arrival of the 
title credits, overlaid over a sequence of quickly switching 'kineto-
tunnels'..

Several sideways travelling texture patterns next, with textures 
changing with the beat at a dizzying speed.. Blink, and you might miss 
a third of this bit!

A nice feature of the Mystic Bytes demo engine, as this effect is 
zoomed off the screen in one window, at the same time that the next 
(tunnel) effect zooms in.. The tunnels are a bit of a harking back to 
older Mystic Bytes and Shadows demos, with a scary 'double exposure' 
effect, slowing down noticeably when doubling up, not a criticism, just 
an observation.. 

It gets as far as triple tunnels, and with light blobs chasing around, 
again with the rapid-fire texture/pattern changes that made the first 
part of the demo so memorable..

Another mood change, a 'Mystic Bytes' big blue text logo etched into a 
background, with just a suggestion of 3-D.. A nearly unnoticeable bump 
map lighting effect plays across the scene, then the text starts to 
move..

It's as if there is a chestbursting alien trying to get out of the 
monitor screen! The logo pulses, leaving an after-blur as it does, and 
I would suggest that this effect would look very impressive on a big 
screen.. Eventually, it gives up the struggle, and drops off the bottom 
of the screen..

Another pause in proceedings, this time, thanks to a sumptious mOd 
drawn still graphic.. This is his graphics competition winner for 
Quast, a female who looks like Bjork, only more 'up for it'!

Someone is making the most of the 'Mystic Bytes' big blue lettering 
logo, we talked about a couple of paragraphs ago, as it rotates and 
fades off into the distance..

Of course, it cannot stay too long in its unadorned state, as a tunnel 
appears and it spins down that instead..

Final part of the demo coming up.. This is an attempt to get textured 
3-D in, mainly by dint of hard work to show as many as possible.. This 
is fair enough, but with a plain blue background and simple objects, is 
outclassed by the comparable 'Motion' Wolfenstein screen, which uses 
the DSP..

As always, finishing is an abrupt process, and we are back out in the 
cold.. Maybe some kind of final screen to wrap up the demo would have 
been nice as it was all over a bit too.......

Teardrop, a big rough, tough rugby player of a demo.. No time for 
showing its soft and sensitive side.. If it came across a queue, it 
would barge its way to the front.. But at the same time, people would 
say "Yes, I think he's got a point there!"

Ratings..

Graphix:- 85% - Textures felt rough and ragged.. Made up for by lovely 
still graphics, and mOd-ernistic approach to some of these 

Sonix:- 80% - Soundtrack going at the speed of light fitted in 
perfectly with the mood here..

Gee-Whiz:- 85% - A slick little mover.. Interesting demo engine, 
suggesting pin-sharp presentation possibilities for future 
productions.. 

Overall: - 83% - Another memorable Mystic Bytes production.. Now just 
kill those rough edges for next time, and we'll be really happy!
