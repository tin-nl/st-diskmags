It was not that long ago when there wasn't such a thing as an Atari 
specific CD ROM. Nowadays there's quite a few to choose from, but they 
all suffer from the same problem. After a while the software on them 
becomes outdated and there is no way of getting updated versions of the 
software without buying a brand new CD ROM. That's all about to change 
now that there's 2 new types of CD ROM format on the market.

The first format (CDR) enables you to write data to a CD ROM, with this 
format you are unable to overwrite what is already contained on the CD 
ROM. The only downside to this format is that any data that is 
subsequently written to the disk can only be read by a multi-session 
compatible CD ROM drive. On the plus side though the price of the CDR 
disks vary in price from œ1 to œ4 depending on branded quality.  

The second format (CDRW) enables you to write data to a CD ROM and re-
write over it if you want. You can even erase the complete disk and 
start again, ideal if you want or need to make regular backups of your 
hard drive contents. The only drawback is the price of the CDRW disks 
can vary in price from œ8 to œ12.

The people at Atari Computing have used the first format in their new 
CD ROM. So let's have a look inside to see what this CD ROM has got to 
offer. Rather than tell you what's on the CD ROM in a random and rather 
confusing fashion, I'll go through it folder by folder giving you a 
rough idea of what's in them. A much more logical way, and easier on my 
ageing senile mind 8-).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all there are a couple of audio tracks on this CD ROM, not 
exactly the right thing to have on an Atari CD ROM I thought. But nice 
music all the same, along the lines of Micheal Oldfield. The tracks 
come from an album by Mark Wherry called Distant Lands. All profits 
from the sale of the album goes to a registered charity.

ROOT DIRECTORY

The best place to start, and here you'll find a copy of CAB so you can 
browse through the integrated HTML docs on the CD ROM. Also the 
/MODULES folder contains a CAB_JPEG.OVL for decoding JPEG's.

So there you have it. A quick overview of what this CD ROM contains. 
The combined price of the full versions of software on this CD ROM more 
than make up for the price of the CD ROM many times over.

                            Audio tracks are a little out of place.
                            
                            Some program duplication.

After all things were taken into consideration I decided to give this 
CD ROM a rather chair busting..
