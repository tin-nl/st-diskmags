1. INTRODUCTION 
---------------


"ERROR IN LINE '99" is a demoscene-related convention (or party), which 
will continue the traditional line of Easter conventions. The 
convention will mainly focus on alternative computersystems, as Acorn, 
Atari, Amiga and C64.

Our general aim is to offer a good surrounding for a meeting of demo- 
sceners and  computerfreaks. So, you can expect some days of 
interesting conversations and creativity. But do not forget, we can 
just offer a good surrounding.

However, we hope to make this convention a remarkable and funny event 
and we will try to keep it as noncommercial as possible.

So let's have a look at the facts:


........................................................................

2. THE TIME 
-----------


The convention will start on:    Friday, 2.April 1999, 03:00 PM. 
And the official ending is:      Monday, 5.April 1999, 11:00 AM.


........................................................................

3. THE PLACE 
------------


We have chosen a very atmospheric and comfortable location, which is 
situated in the centre of Dresden. For instance it takes 5 minutes to 
walk to the central railway station or 15 minutes to walk to the 
historical core of our town, which is really worth a visit, by the way.



HOW TO GET TO THE PARTY PLACE? 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If you want to come by CAR, there are TWO POSSIBILITIES how to get to 
the party place:


I.

If you take the A4 from "EISENACH", then leave the motorway at the EXIT 
"DRESDEN-ALTSTADT." Then always follow the traffic signs which lead to 
"PRAG".

After a while, you will reach a street, called "NUERNBERGER EI." This 
street is easily recognizable, because it is a big street (4 tracks), 
which is divided by a big "GREEN ISLE". Go straight there, till you 
reach the first TRAFFIC LIGHT AFTER the "NUERN- BERGER EI". Then turn 
LEFT here (direction: Hauptbahnhof (central station).

Drive down the hill and you will see a RUSSIAN CHURCH on the right 
side. Turn LEFT, after you passed this Russian Church. Now you are 
driving on the "Reichenbachstrasse".

Finally turn RIGHT into the next street and look for a parking place. 
Then follow the SIGNS to get to the location.


II.

The second possibility, if you come by car, is to take the A4 from 
BAUTZEN. Leave the motorway at the EXIT "DRESDEN-HELLERAU". Then turn 
RIGHT and always go STRAIGHT till you reach the BAHNHOF NEUSTADT 
(railwaystation "Neustadt"). Drive through under the railway and turn 
RIGHT.

Then go STRAIGHT again. You will drive over a big BRIDGE and after some 
minutes of driving, you will reach the HAUPTBAHNHOF (central station). 
Turn RIGHT here and drive through under the station.

Then you will see a "CONRAD ELECTRONICS" - building on the right side. 
After this building, turn RIGHT into the next small street. Turn LEFT 
again, when you reach the next crossroad. Go straight then, and after 
ca. 200 meters, look for a parking place. Then follow the signs to get 
to the parking place.



If you come by TRAIN, you will find the party place very easily. Either 
ask people for way or just use the following description:

Leave the railway station through the MAINDOORS. Then turn right. Go 
straight forward and you will walk under a bridge. Then you will cross 
a street and you will stand in front of the "CONRAD" - building. Now 
just walk along the building on its left side and you will 
automatically come on a sidewalk, situated beside a bigger street. Now 
just go straight. If you see a meadow on the right side after some 50 m 
walk, you will be on the right way. Keep on going straight and you will 
see two yellow phonebooths on the light right side. In face of those 2 
phone- booths you will be able to see the party place's entrance doors, 
beside a sign "GAG 18".

We will put up SIGNS, so you will find the way easier.



And if you want to come by PLANE, you should inform us as early as 
possible, so that we can take you from the airport Dresden-Klotzsche to 
the party place by car.
