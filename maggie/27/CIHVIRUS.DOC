Complete system failure is the goal  of  a virus claimed by experts to 
be the first of its type and  able  to paralyse a PCs bios - the low 
level system that kickstarts your  PC.  Thus  far no cure has been 
found.

The CIH virus; discovered  this  week;  is generally agreed by experts 
to have  originated  from  South  East  Asia  and  is  able to override 
the Flash Bios in  PCs  running  Windows 9x although NT users will not 
be affected.

Once the virus attacks - scheduled  for  the  26th of each month - its 
payload attempts to overwrite the  Flash  Bios.  If  the Flash Bios is 
write-enabled; which is the case for many modern machines; the PC is 
crippled to the point of not  being able to boot-up. At the same time  
CIH  has  been   known   to   overwrite   the  hard  drive  with 
'garbage'  according  to   Graham   Cluley  senior technical consultant 
at Dr Solomon's. "We've never seen a virus that can do this before,"  
Cluley  said. "There are three known variants and at least  two  of  
these  have  been  found  in the wild. Although none of our  customers  
have  reported  complete failure they have experienced serious 
symptoms."

The infection is spread over  the  Internet  by  either hiding in news 
groups or lurking as  downloadable  executable  files.  Although it is 
known to execute once per month,  it  is not known whether CIH can 
replicate itself. "The virus is a fragmented cavity virus" according to 
Paul Ducklin head of research at anti-virus software company Sophos.  
"We  have  seen tests in our labs and it definitely works."

Although Sophos is unaware  of  any  cases  in  the UK, CIH's nature as 
a "program parasitic  virus"  means it has partial stealth capabilities 
and  can  hide  in  the  unused  space of Windows Portable Executble 
files - the most  common  type of EXE. Although the contents of a file 
change, the  file  size does not making it very difficult to spot.

Such Win32/CIH viruses are able to split up the body of the virus code 
and place it  within  unused  parts  of  the  infected  file.  Both Dr 
Solomon's and Sophos offer detection but are still working on a cure. 
Prevention  is  available   for   some   motherboards  however.  Those 
motherboards fitted with jumpers can be set to stop flash updates.


Wireplay hit by CIH virus

Over the past two  weeks,  at  least  three Internet gaming sites 
caught the WIN95.CIH virus. In two  cases, they may have passed it on 
to their users.

According to official notices on their  sites, both No. 3 Internet 
gaming service  mplayer.com  and  BT's  Wireplay  posted infected 
updates to  their  sites,  which  automatically  upgraded  --  and 
infected -- customer computers. "Anywhere  from zero to 500 of our 
customers could have  downloaded the virus." said Paul Matteucci, CEO  
of  Mpath  which  owns  mplayer.com.  "We are extremely sorry. Mplayer 
is as much a victim as anyone else who got infected."

British  Telecom's  Wireplay  also   posted  an  infected  update 
program, according to an  official  Internet  posting on its site. 
"Anyone who downloaded Wireplay  version  2.2  between  3 p.m. on 
Monday afternoon and 6.30 p.m.  on  Tuesday  evening should delete the 
installation file  and  take  immediate  action." stated the posting. A 
spokesman for BT told  ZDNet  News: "The CIH virus was up there but we 
acted extremely quickly and responsibly. As soon as we found out it was 
there it  came down and we've contacted everyone who downloaded the 
affected client  software.  They have all been sent patches."

According to  BT's  spokesman,  the  Dr  Solomons  anti virus software, 
used to protect  the  client  download site, did not recognise the 
virus at first  but  is  now  equipped  to deal with the problem.

The  CIH  virus  is  deadly.  When  triggered,  it  reformats  any 
connected hard drive and on susceptible computers causes the system 
BIOS chip to erase  itself  --  essentially making the computer 
"forget"  its  internal  language,   according  to  Nick FitzGerald, 
editor of the Virus Bulletin.

The virus activates on April 26th,  June 26th, and the 26th of every 
month, depending on the version. It is the latter variant -- known 
alternatively as WIN95.CIH1.4  and WIN95.CIH.SPACEFILLER -- that 
Mplayer.com found in its systems.  For Math's Matteucci, the virus 
represents  the  worst  kind  of   Internet  terrorism.  "We  are 
absolutely outraged," he said. "I would love to find the guy who  wrote  
this  thing."  Matteucci  told  ZDNet  News  that mplayer.com was 
infected on  Tuesday  morning  at  10 a.m. and noticed problems around  
4  p.m.  "By  5  p.m.,  we  knew  we  had  a virus." he said. "Within  
15  minutes,  we shut down the system."

Mplayer.com  has  800,000   registered   users,  according  to industry 
analyst Forrester Research.   By late Thursday, Matteucci said 
Mplayer.com expects to  post  a  utility  that will automatically 
detect the virus in the mplayer.com client  -- whether or not the user 
caught it from Mplayer -- and tell customers how to get rid of it. 

While the total number of users  who  have caught the virus from these 
incidents is unknown, several  victims  have contacted ZDNet News. "I 
am positive  that  I  got  it  from mplayer.com", one Quake player, who 
asked to remain anonymous, said via e-mail. "Over ten  friends  have 
gotten it as well. Mplayer obviously isn't going to say anything."  
While the company had posted a notice that it had  temporarily shut 
down its gaming news due to the virus, the note  made  no  mention of 
the possible user infection. Matteucci told ZDNet  News  this  was 
because "we were not sure if we infected anyone at all."

Because the site was contaminated  after  July  26th  -- and the virus 
does not trigger again until August 26th -- Mplayer subscribers should 
be able to purge the virus before it overwrites their hard drives. 

The incidents raise the  question:  Are  multiplayer  gaming sites the 
cholera-laced wells of  the  Internet?   The  people  who visit gaming 
sites are a high-risk population, said  the product manager of the 
Internet entertainment site that had a  close call with the CIH virus. 

"Basically, the kind  of  people  who  visit  games  site are Internet 
savvy people, they are  on  the  Net  and download on the  many  
'warez' sites they  go  to, it's   pretty   likely   that  they  will  
get contaminated."

Adding fuel to the fire,  many  companies  do not regularly update 
their anti-virus software  signature  files. "If  they choose to update 
on a quarterly  basis,  then  they  won't  be able to catch these types 
of viruses." said Vincent Gulotto." manager of anti-virus and  security 
firm Network Associates' McAfee Labs.
