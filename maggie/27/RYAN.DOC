FELICE'S VIEWPOINT

During World War II, a number of key events occurred that, 
altogether, shaped the future direction of the war itself. One of 
these events was the D-Day landings, made by the Americans into 
German-occupied France, and part of the incredible events that 
occured here are re-enacted by Steven Spielberg and the cast of 
this incredible movie.

The film starts with the initial landings at Omaha Beach, in June 
of 1942. As the American GIs make their way towards the shore, 
all is quiet. However, suddenly, unseen guns start firing, 
killing and injuring most of the GIs before they have even got 
off their boats. The photography here, along with the movie 
itself, is very graphic, very violent, and, like the sequence of 
the actual escape in 'Escape From Sobibor', a sequence that most 
people will remember for a very long time to come.

Tom Hanks leads the cast in the movie. Their mission, basically, 
is to save 'Private Ryan', the only survivor of 4 brothers (the 
other 3 having been killed in action elsewhere). A long trek is 
made by Hanks and the cast with him until they finally find 
Private Ryan himself - played by Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting).

But, whilst Ryan himself is pleased that Hanks and the others 
have turned up to rescue him, he, currently one of a platoon, is 
unwilling to desert and leave his fellow soldiers behind, despite 
all that has happened. A compromise is reached, followed by 
another graphic battle sequence.

Saving Private Ryan is, no doubt, one of the movies of the 
century. There are some elements from 'Escape from Sobibor' in 
the movie - the technical crew behind the scenes who provided the 
guns and ammo are the same as in the earlier movie. The camera 
work in general is fantastic, despite being very gory in places. 
People with very weak stomachs would be advised to seek advice 
before watching the movie, as the action and gore is very intense 
at times.

CIH'S VIEWPOINT

Summer livin', hard  to  recall  now,  as  winter  breathes icily onto 
unprotected fingers, and you shiver just  a little bit before throwing 
another Door-to-door salesman on the fire..  (This one going up with a 
roar tried to convince me to take  up  a new fitted kitchen, he didn't 
know just how hot his welcome was going to be, heh heh!)

One red hot facet of a generally damp and disappointing summer was the 
heavily touted D-Day-o-rama   'Saving  Private  Ryan', praised for its 
unprecedented and  unflinching  portrayal  of  war  as  hell,  indeed, 
reinfecting crumbly veterans of WWII who  went  along to watch it with 
almost forgotten combat trauma, if the media is to be believed..

For those of you with a gnat-like attention span, it is a LONG film,  
the  best  part  of three hours, so bottom-numbing cinema seats are to 
be avoided..  The  film is gripping enough to keep you on the edge  of  
those  same  seats  though,  so any discomfort is mentally shunted 
aside until the end credits are well underway..

Very briefly,  the film is set during the 'D-Day' landings in Normandy 
(June 1944) and takes in the American landing on 'Bloody Omaha' Beach, 
and fictional events  (the  'saving'  of  Private  Ryan)  in  the days 
immediately after the initial invasion..

Most film reviewers greatest admiration is  expressed  at the initial 
25 minute sequence portraying the D-Day  invasion,  or  the American 
attempts to get a  foothold  on  Omaha  beach..  This  part  of  the  
film  has  a (deliberate) 'newsreel' quality to it, as  if a news 
cameraman of  the day was in the  thick  of  the  action,  and  there  
are clever little asides, such as blood splashes on  the  camera lens, 
which becomes the audiences main viewpoint, to  reinforce  this..  

Indeed, this sequence has been praised for its authenticity, but  I 
tend to think that there is a little too much choreography, that  limbs 
fly off and bodies blow apart in time  with  the  beat,  and  that  a  
lot  of  the  death and desolation has been smartly summoned to order.. 

I personally got the feeling that the real thing was probably  as  
harrowing,  but  a  lot less visually compelling, and it was probably 
individual recollections of  particular events, rather than a  grand  
sweeping  whizz-bang  camera tour of the whole battlefield (If  it's  
Tuesday,  it  must  be  decapitation from shellfire) that would affect 
any actual participants in a battle of this sort..

Still, top marks for trying, it is  as  close to the truth as any sane 
person will want to get..

At this stage, you glimpse the  first vague stirrings of the principal 
characters in the film, before  the  initial  assault is concluded and 
the main part of the film takes over..

 The 'Saving' of  the fictional Private Ryan  is not based on any true 
event,  and  seems  to  be  a   little   bit  unfeasible  in  how  the 
circumstances arose.. Of four brothers,  three  were  killed, one in a 
theatre of  war  on  the  other  side  of  the  world..  Somehow, this 
coincidence is discovered and in  a show of humanitarian consideration 
totally missing from the initial half-hour  of the film, it is decided 
to bring the surviving fourth brother home.. The problem is that he is 
in a very exposed frontline position, and  this is the origin point of 
the rescue mission to bring him back to safety..

The main part of  the  film  concentrates  on  the rescue mission, and 
contrasts from the opening sequence by developing a 'dirty half-dozen' 
relationship with the individual squad members..

In charge, is a very effectively played Tom Hanks lead, Captain Miller, 
Jeremy Davies, as the nerdy corporal Upham is the outsider who provides 
us with our main viewpoint into the film.. Also strongly characterised 
are the Jewish private, played by Adam Goldberg, who relishes his 
encounters with the enemy, and Barry Pepper, as the steely-eyed and 
laconic Southern sniper.. The squad is an 'Everytown USA' mix of 
characters that can be easily identified by the audience..

On their way to collect Ryan,  the  squad undergo a perverted Pilgrims 
progress through a battlefield that  is  very  much in dispute.. There 
are a great number of  classy  action  scenes on the way, intermingled 
with horror, that  is,  not  the  overblown  egotistical expression of 
'HORROR!' in big capital letters, of films like 'Apocalypse  Now',  but  
the everyday, plausible sort of horror,  such as where the attempted 
rescue of trapped French civilians goes wrong  with  one of the squad 
slowly bleeding to death in open view  of  a  sniper, and with no-one 
able to do anything at all.. 

There is one of the  best-staged  action sequences of any war film 
tagged on here where the last thing that the enemy sniper sees, sitting  
high in the church steeple and scanning the village below for his next 
victim, is the gunflash from the  shot  that  enters through his sniper 
scope, and kills him a scant second later..

There is some attempt at  lightening  the  mid-section of the film, as 
there is a small amount of banter  within  the squad "I don't bitch so 
you can hear,  I  bitch  UP  to  my  superior  officer!"  from 
Hanks/Miller.. There is also a well-though out attempt by this film to 
portray some measure of cynicism and disaffection to what is seen as an 
unnecessary and dangerous mission, where the squad are gleefully 
sifting through identity  dogtags  of  dead  soldiers,  hoping to find 
Ryan's in there so they don't have to go on any further..

There is also a sequence where a  prisoner is taken, and one of the 
great taboo  subjects  of  the  Second World War is brutally brought 
into the open.. It looks like the  prisoner  will be shot out of hand, 
an image totally at  odds  with  general  perceptions  of heroic and 
honourable conduct by Allied troops during this time.. This dilemma is 
intelligently explored and a nasty ending only just avoided.. You sense 
that the squad as individuals, and as a collective entity, were pushed 
very close to the edge.. Miller is shown particularly under increasing 
strain as the film goes on, an ordinary man, albeit of above average 
competence and great self-awareness, being taken further and further 
away from his previous soft civilian humane convictions..
 
Eventually, Ryan is found in a  blasted  hellhole of a wrecked French 
town, a superb example of set-building, on the very edge of the allied 
advance,  and  hopelessly   outnumbered   in   a  strategically  vital 
position.. Ryan, as played by Matt Damon, a little too close to an 
idealised 'movie' hero perhaps, decides to stay  to  defend  his  
position..  This,  of  course  leads  to the brilliantly  staged  final  
battle  scene,  parts  of  which  take  an amazingly 'adult'  approach  
to  the  subject  and  manage  to  neatly sidestep the cliche set-
pieces seen in too many other films..
 
Spielberg's belief in the 'Good Guys' winning (especially if they are 
American!) does break through in the end,  as  it  seems  you  cannot  
entirely suppress the sentimental side of the director.. You do feel 
motivated to congratulate the self-restraint of the director for the 
other 98% of the film where he got it more or less spot on..

The authenticity index of this film  is  very high, and I cannot spare 
enough praise for the researchers  and set builders and the props 
department, and those folk who raided historical  military  vehicle  
collections, to get this aspect just about right.. It  made  a  
refreshing change to see proper Tiger tanks grinding menacingly  up  
the  street, 88mm death spitting forth, rather  than poorly disguised 
and thinly painted up (but cheaply available) postwar  kit  trying to 
masquerade as the real thing.. According  to  someone  connected  with 
the film, the 'Hooey' factor had been kept as  low  as possible, with 
the quality of research, and in many cases,  actual  weapons,  vehicles 
and even some uniforms which were in use during D-Day, were also used 
in this film..

There are a few faults inherent even in a film of this quality.. There 
was  a  gratuitous tacked-on present day sequence at the beginning and 
end of the film, which seemed to be a self-conscious attempt by 
Spielberg to  'reach  out'  to  his  fathers  generation, those who 
underwent the Second World War.. Some of the jokey banter when Corporal 
Upham was trying to get to know the squad seemed a little bit 
contrived.. Also, I wasn't totally convinced of Upham's transformation 
in the film from a stumbling nerd with a rifle and pack three sizes too 
big for him, to a super cool urbane intellectual calmly 'dissing' the 
music of Edith Piaf, just moments before the bowel-loosening final 
battle was due to commence.. 

There  were some ill- informed comments by the British  press  that 
this was an all-American production, that no mention was made of the 
Allied contribution to the D-Day landings.. I don't personally find 
fault with this approach, as the British and American armies conducted 
operations entirely separately from each  other  and  each  had  their  
own  beachheads to attack and detailed inter-allied contact was only 
made at very high levels.. I don't see how  introducing  a  'British' 
element to this film would have  been  possible  without  imposing  an  
unfeasible  'Hooey' overload on it!

Having said that, there seemed to  be one throwaway comment included 
about 'Monty being overrated' (General  Bernard  Law Montgomery, the 
British commander) and this seems to be a snide little comment squeezed 
in  at the behest of some bigheaded anglophobe technical adviser with 
little of a constructive nature to do on the film..

(Whatever next, a remake of the 'Battle of Britain', fought and won 
ENTIRELY by wealthy American socialites dressed up in RAF uniforms, all 
because flying Spitfires was a 'fun' thing to do and the British (or 
rather, English) people were too busy being beastly to the lower 
classes to bother to do anything to defend themselves!?)

(Or how about 'Apocalypse Milkman', yet another agonised reappraisal of 
the Vietnam War, where the principal character, Lt Oliver Stone, 
suffers a complete post combat trauma inspired personality meltdown as 
a result of dropping an M16 ammunition clip on his big toe, and 50,000 
nameless Vietnamese get their lungs scorched out in a fiery death in a 
self-indulgent fit of madness!?! And isn't it amazing, even with those 
Vietnam movies which professed to say that "War Sucks" made by 
directors with left-liberal sensitivities, they still treated the poor 
bloody Vietnamese as so much anonymous human cordwood to be disposed of 
as callously as the director wished! No real attempt at character 
building and contacting the audience through 'Gook' eyes, it's all done 
from the poor traumatised (and heavily armed) Yankees point of view!)

Sorry, going off the subject big time there!

Anyway, these are small faults, and set against the brilliance of the 
rest of this film, can easily be forgiven..

I can say that I liked this film a lot, yes I did.. I wouldn't 
recommend that you make it the centrepiece of a romantic evening out 
though! This just leaves two final questions to ask..

Is this Spielberg's best ever film? Not quite.. For me, the 'perfect' 
Spielberg picture is still 'Jaws'.. Private Ryan is too big and 
sprawling and lacking the pure single minded direction of that fishy 
classic..

But we then ask, is this a classic war film, redefining the convention 
away from a past form of shallow, cardboard  John Wayne gung-ho-ism, 
and also away from those equally unrepresentative 'Me Generation' 
manufactured South East Asian blood and pity sessions?

             ....Most definitely!
