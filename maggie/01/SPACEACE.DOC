You  MUST of heard of Space Ace!  Come on you MUST!  yes its  the 
cartoon/game..  with mega grafix,  sound and crap game-play or is 
it?

I first got Space Ace on 5 disks,  all of which were 11  sectors, 
Double sided,  1 Meg Memory and fully packed! My first impression 
was  "Wow  this is going to be great!" then I thought  about  the 
review: "GREAT GRAFIX CRAP GAME PLAY" This haunted me all the way 
home  until I finally reached my goal,  that glinting grey  mega-
machine  I call Liz (Don't worry readers,  we know he  is  crazy, 
Ed).  I  sat  down and took out the boot disk,  hands  shaking  I 
placed it in the video,  I turned on my ST and nothing  happened!  
"OH NO! 45 QUID DOWN THE DRAIN! I'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK!"

Oh no, its ok I put it in the video (see I told you so, ed). Ok I 
put it in Liz's disk drive (ooo err! ed) and rebooted the disk.

Da da da dar.. da da da da da darrr! Dum.. Space Ace!
Well that's what came out,  wow,  I said to myself in erm..  um.. 
wowingness  I  pressed fire and up came the  first  level:  "LOOK 
THERE's  BORFS  SHIP!!" "ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH....." (as jenny  or  kim 
whatever her name is falls of the cliff!  "OH NO JENNNYYYY...." I 
cryed  (well  space  ace  did any way!) This  is  it  the  game.. 
suddenly  the door to borfs space craft opened and out  came  the 
blue alien slime ball on a hover board.  "CHRIST HE's GOT A GUN!" 
(I  said that not space ace) BOOOMMMBBB (he fired it),  I  jumped 
left... BOOOMMMBB (he fired again) I jumped right just in time... 
BOOOMMMBBB  (This is getting to be a pain) I jumped down  and  he 
hit the rock! (hahaha)

That's it I did the first level!  And that's all there  is,  just 
moves,  its  very hard to get the moves right but with a  bit  of 
help  from  a certain well known magazine I soon was  on  my  way 
though the disks..  1,  2,  3,  nearly there.. 4... 5 at last the 
last level!

Well  I  finished it with the tips and now that I can  finish  it 
without  having to concentrate on all my moves I could marvel  at 
the artwork, animation and great sonnix!

Ok  it  hasn't  got good game play but I  quite  liked  the  game 
myself.  The only thing that would stop me recommending it is the 
price 45 soves!  But there is a way round that! Yes Mail Order is 
a  wonderful  thing!  Just  call up any  of  the  best,  Evesham, 
Dungeon, Castle etc.. all are very good..

My verdict.. If ya got the dosh buy it!
