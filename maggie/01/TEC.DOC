                         by Sammy Joe of TLB

Oh god,  not another demo I hear you say....  First of all I need 
to do some explaning, the equipment I am using at the moment is a 
monochrome monitor,  a Television and a 1040STFM.  The Television 
is also running because I am watching Home and Away while  typing 
all this crap.  You wanna know what is happening in Home and Away 
?  No ?  Well I am going to tell you anyway:  Mr Stewart and  Tom 
Fletcher are lost at see,  Else Stewart is having a baby boy.  Oh 
hang on,  Tom and the other guy just stranded on a lonly  island, 
They seem pretty exhausted,  ( I wonder what they have been up to 
when they were alone in this boat in the middle of nowhere.  This 
prat called Lens Smart is just telling about heaven,  yaaaawnnnn, 
this  series is dead boring.  It is so stupid,  you just have  to 
laugh the whole time.....

Home and Away just finsihed,  I'll just switch to channel 1, yes, 
good timing,  Neighbours is on now,  do you want to know what  is 
happening there,  tough luck,  I am going to do the actual review 
now.

I  received  this demo this morning.  So,  for the  fourth  time, 
here's the review....

The  demo starts off with a nice picture and a four track  sample 
player,  the  sample player sounds like the one  from  Microdeal. 
When  you  press  a key,  you get the  second  loader  screen,  2 
scrollers and an empire sign shrinking and growing, a starfield.

The  in between loader consists of a scroller at the bottom  aong 
with some great musix and some very very nice graphix.

The  main menu consists of a starfield and a scroller.  With  the 
cursor  keys  you  can select  the  various  screens.  By  either 
pressing  left or right a picture of the screen you are about  to 
enter is displayed. 

The first screen is very very nice,  it consists of lodsa sprites 
flying  and bouncing around in different wave  forms.  There  are 
four  scrollers  at  the bottom (sort  of  ish  paralaxing).  The 
scrollers  are reflected in a big boucning ball at the to of  the 
screen. Very Very nice screen.

The  second screen has a big sprite,  the usual star field and  a 
scroller. Not very exiting, but the screen is probably as good as 
the one in the Mindbomb but the graphix lack a bit.

This screen is quite nice again, the whole background is spinning 
around  and a very very big scroller scrolls across  the  screen. 
along  with all that there is a sample (quality is not so  good). 
This screen is one of my favourites.

The  fourth  screen is the worst in the  demo,  there  are  lodsa 
scrollers and that's it.

This  screen is mega good,  there are eve more scrollers than  in 
the screen above going in the various directions.  This screen is 
just  impossible to read,  it is even worse than the one  in  the 
Mindbomb or the So Watt demo. I reckon that this screen is one of 
the best screens in the demo although it lacks graphix again.

The next screen contains 22 different 4 channel tunes,  they  are 
all pretty good. Pretty nice screen, the samples are 15 Khz. 

This screen is a simple copy program with some great musix. 
(The guy who programmed it advised me to use the FCopy).

The  last  screen is the best screen in the  demo,  it  has  some 
excellent sinus dots,  they are very very  nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The 
screen  also  contains some scrollers and a sign saying  V8  that 
bounces up and down. I RECKON THAT THIS SCREEN IS THE BEST SCREEN 
IN THIS DEMO!!!! Well worth taking a look at.

Now, the screen that I have not reviewed yet is the Reset screen. 
This screen looks quite good,  there are lodsa scrollers bouncing 
up and down and some other weird things happening.

So  ,that's  this demo done and over  with,  excuse  my  spelling 
or  grammar  mistakes in this article as  I,  again.  was  rather 
pissed  when  I wrote this demo review.  The reason why I  am  so 
pissed, is that I fucked up my chemistry exam today.

Here's the demo summary:
