     Those of you considering buying an STE,  or for those of you 
who are lucky enough to already own one,  here are some pros  and 
cons  of the marvellous machine machine,  which Atari  calls  the 
'Amiga Beater'.


     One  problem  with the STE is that it will not  boot  up  in 
medium  res.   This is because Atari says that medium res is  not 
required as games run in low res and any serious user would use a 
mono monitor.   In fact there is a way to make the STE boot up in 
medium  res.   All you have to do is set up the desktop  how  you 
require it and 'save desktop', then use a word processor, such as 
First Word Plus,  and load in the desktop.inf file.   On the line 
which begins with an 'E' you will see 4 numbers.  Change the last 
number to a 3 and then save the file again as  desktop.inf.   Hey 
Presto  !!  The next time that you boot your STE with that  disk, 
you will be presented with a desktop in medium res.


     The STE trys to boast about 4096 colours, enhanced sound and 
enhanced  graphics,  not to mention hardware scrolling,  but  the 
main  problem with the 'enhancements' of the STE is the new  disk 
drive  and  controller.   The disk drive will now only  read  and 
write  up  to  track  81,  and this  causes  problems  with  some 
software.   Some  software houses like to put the protection  for 
their brand new game on track 82.   This means that you've  spent 
25  quid on a game that doesn't run on a computer that is  'fully 
compatible' with Tos V 1.09,  the Tos which was used in the newer 
ST's.   Some software is made STE compatible,  but still come  on 
single  sided disks.   Now then,  how many STE's have Atari  made 
with with single sided drives?   None is the answer to that!  But 
with  all of its faults I prefer the STE to either the ST or  the 
Amiga.   One  thing  to be aware of with the STE  is  the  memory 
boards which plug in to give you instant upgrades.  There are, as 
far as I know,  two different types of memory board for the  STE.  
These are SIMM boards, and SIP boards.  So if you are planning to 
buy an upgrade,  do check to see which one you have.   It is easy 
to tell the difference between them as the SIMM boards push in  a 
slot rather like the cartridge port, and the SIP boards have tiny 
pins on the bottom of them,  like those on IC's,  and push into a 
strip.  The stereo sound which the STE boasts about can be played 
through  an  amplifier with the help of two stereo jacks  on  the 
back of the STE, just underneath the power switch.  At the moment 
there is no point in the two analogue ports on the side the  STE, 
but we are promised that there will be such things as light guns, 
light pens,  game paddles etc etc which will be able to plug into 
these.  For these ports to work,  there must be a DAC, or Digital 
to  Analogue Converter,  attached them somewhere inside the  STE.  
If this is the case,  they could be put into better use as  sound 
samplers.


     The  enhanced sound and graphics are a great improvement  on 
the  ST and have to be seen to be really appreciated.   They  can 
only be described as like the Amiga but better,  but then  again, 
the  ST  was like the Amiga but better.   I would always  try  to 
persuade  anyone  to buy an STE if they can afford it as  it  is, 
despite  all of its faults and all the slagging off that  it  has 
had since being released,  the best 16 bit computer on the market 
for the money.
