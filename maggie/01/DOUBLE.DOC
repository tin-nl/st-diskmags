
DOUBLE DRAGON II BY BEN DOLLEY

     A few years back saw the release of Double Dragon which  was 
in  all pretty crap.One of the main drawbacks was that you  could 
complete  the game on your first go unless your were  a  complete 
freak of nature which made you incapable of completing incredibly 
easy games in one go.With average graphics,poor  scrolling,boring 
sound and awful gameplay Double dragon was a bit of a mistake  to 
say the least.
     Now  out  from  Ocean comes Double  Dragon  II  which  isn`t 
actually all that good either,but i decided to review it none the 
less.

   Double Dragon II is a horizontally and occasionally vertically  
scrolling  game  in  which you can have 2  players  on  1  screen 
game.The lives and amount of energy you have is displayed for you 
at the bottom of the screen.The idea of the game is to rescue you 
beloved     girl   friend   who     seems     to    like    being  
kidnapped  by  the  famous shadow gang.The game  comprises  of  5 
levels   which  are  inhabited  by  Willy's  the  gangs   leaders 
henchemen.To  complete  a level you first have to  kill  all  the 
enemies  and the big boss who is at the end of each level with  a 
variety  of  moves  which include  back  kicks,flying  kicks  and 
punches etc.
   Some enemies can take more hits than others and are better  at 
executing  moves.Along  the  way you can pick  up  a  variety  of 
weapons  which you can throw or use in hand to hand,they  include 
knives,maces,boxes,spades  or axes,boxes and iron balls  which  i 
would  were  quite  heavy,but the enemies just  pick  up  without 
difficulty.
   Some points i feel i have to mention is that at the end of the 
last  level  when you come across the gangs boss Willy  he  seems 
incapable of shooting you.He looks as if he can't fire straight,i 
mean i thought that if armed with a machine gun he should of been 
able to blow you away quite quickly.Also the last two people  are 
also  pretty  useless.The  game also is really just  to  easy  to 
complete  with most people being able to complete it after a  few 
games.

   EFFECTS

  Not much to say here except that the graphics are okay and  the 
sound  is  a bit on the poor side.The  scrolling  is  alright,but 
nothing to show off about.

   RESULTS

I  still think that ocean could have done a better job  and  this 
this  game doesn't come up to oceans usual standard.Nothing  much 
to say about it really and it was a pretty boring game to review.
