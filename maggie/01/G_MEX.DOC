
Manchester Computer Show..
By Dave -R-

This show was the first show I had been to in the north,  I  live 
in Liverpool,  so it was quite handy to get to. The venue was the 
massive G-MEX centre, only half the hall was used, due to the few 
companies attending. 

The Computer Cash 'n' Carry,  as it was named, wasn't as success-
full as the Shopper Show for bargains and the name sugests.....
There  were a few bargains going like a 4 Megabyte STFM  for  476 
pounds,  and lots of second hand ST's...  The main stands  taking 
they money were,  Evesham Micros,  16/32 PDL, and a console mail-
order company, SUPER VISON, from whom I got my MegaDrive.

The  was the first appearance of 'The Other PDL' at a  show,  and 
even  though they had a big stand (In a terrible  location)  they 
seemed  to  be  doing well.  I had my little PDL set  up  on  the 
Kepmston Stand,  who seemed to make quite a bit,  we sold out  of 
Naska  mice on the 3rd day!  MasterSound sold well and the  Data-
Scan  was going brilliantly...  My PDL sold about 20 demos  in  3 
days so its a good job I didn't pay for the stand!

There  were  a number of companies selling add-on to the  ST  and 
perepheials,  such as Flexi Dump,  Thingi, and the Sound Blasters 
were selling well to,  I used one and was quite  impressed!  (Our 
1st C.C.C. demo sounds great though it!)
        
The  'WAR' demo was supposed to be released by Dal,  he  couldn't 
get  to the show,  and anyway he was drunk the night before so  I 
don't think he finished it (He still hasn't!).

The  most  popular  demo was the 'ST SOUND  TRACKER'  by  the  ST 
Connexions, the SO WHATT? demo by TCB went well too..

I  think  that if more companies could be bothered to go  to  the 
northen shows they would be better,  there are too many  companys 
who are just to lazy to go anywhere else to sell there products..
It's all well and good having Shows in London, but there are more 
people  outside  of  100  miles from London  who  have  ST's  and 
Doorstoppers (opps sorry Amigas)..


         In a nut-shell it wasn't to good a show!!
