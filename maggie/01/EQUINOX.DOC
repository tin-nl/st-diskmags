                                   by Sammy Joe of TLB

Today I received a letter from a French crew,  I'll give you  one 
guess,  yes,  it's  Equinox.  They have send me there rather  old
Sound Tracker demo, which still is very good. 

By  the way,  at the moment I am listening to Coronor.  It  is  a 
Thrash Metal band from Switzerland.  These guys are  great,  some 
weeks ago, they came to a record shop just around the corner from 
where  I live.  These great guys also signed my  Leather  Jacket, 
looks groovy.  What am I talking about, I should be reviewing the 
Equinox Player.

This Equinox player is along with the ST Connexion one,  the best 
around  (wait  until the LOST BOYS  will  release  theirs).  This 
program  will play any Module (MOD) file ported from  the  AMIGA. 
This allows you to have the same sample quality on your ST as the 
AMIGA has. Isn't that great eeh? Their demo disk contains various 
great  tunes.  When  you play one of them,  you get 4  very  nice 
volume   indicators along with a piece of Graphix at the  top  of 
the screen saying Equinox. 

To  say something else about the MOD files,  if you can lay  your 
hands  on an Amiga (of course you do not really want to do  that) 
and  the program DOS to DOS,  you can port these 4 Channel  great 
quality samples over to your good old ST.

The program with which you select the samples is quite good  too, 
the program checks the disk for MOD files,  then prints the  ones 
that  it has found on the screen.  You then can move around  with 
the cursor and select your musix.

There's  nothing more to say,  except that the whole source  code 
for their players is on the disk,  partly even documented.  GREAT 
STUFF guys. Here's my summary:
