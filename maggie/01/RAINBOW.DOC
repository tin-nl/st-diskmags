
RAINBOW ISLANDS BEN DOLLEY

  
    Well  after  a week of problems with my  ST  I  have  finally 
decided  to this review of the great new game Rainbow-Islands  on 
my freinds computer.So here we go...
   
    It  has been three years since you and your  friend  Bob  had 
banished  evil  from  their lands.But as you  dealt  the  killing 
bubble evil said that it would return.You and Bob were now living 
happily  on  the  first  of  the  seven  islands  as  next   door 
neighbours.But on the day that you were remembering the time when 
you  killed  the  last  monster  a  sudden  blackness  came   and 
overpowered  all  of the seven islands.After a  quick  think  you 
decided to try and rid evil once again...

   This  game is one of those games which being pretty  cute  and 
cuddly  would have a couple of years ago been put to the back  of 
the software shelves never to be touched again!But this game also 
being   very  cute  has  one  main  advantage  it  is   very,very 
addictive,being  one  of those games you can play for  hours  and 
love it.It`s not one of the games you play for an hour and  never 
touch  it  again.This is the follow-up to the very  popular  game 
Bubble-Bobble realesed some years back.
   You  play  a very cute character who`s aim is  to  rid  seven 
islands   of   the   evil   monsters   that   have   taken   them 
over.The  game  scrolls vertically up with you  starting  at  the 
bottom  and trying to reach the top.Fortunately our hero  is  not 
completely    defenceless   against   the   oncoming  monsters he
has  the  power to fire rainbows that can be used as  bridges  or 
stepping-stones.You  can  also  hit  monsters  directly  or  trap 
them,traping them makes them very angry and it is advised for you 
to  quickly  jump  on  the  rainbow  killing  any  monsters  trap 
inside.Some  monsters  can take 2 rainbows to destroy  and  after 
taking  1 hit can get very annoyed so it is advised to trap  them 
under  a  rainbow  and  stamp  on  it  killing  it  immediately. 
Unfortunately  the  rainbow only has a limited time  for  you  to 
walk  over it and then it will fade and vanish.At first  you  can 
only fire 1 rainbow,but sometimes when you kill a monster a small 
pot  appears,collecting it means that you are able to fire up  to 
three  rainbows  which is very powerful.Every  monster  you  kill 
leaves  an  item which is usually fruit which  give  you  varying 
amounts of points.Other items include diamonds and emeralds which 
also top up your points.
   At the end of island you are faced with a huge  monster  which 
include  a helicopter and spider.The monsters hits are  displayed 
at  the  top of the screen which is useful.At the  end  of  every 
round which you have to complete  in a certain  time ( there  are  
five  rounds  to every island),you see a treasure box comes  down 
from the sky and opens spreading out vasts amounts of fruit which 
if all collected can give you a lot of points.The only problem is 
you have a certain amount of time in which to complete the  level 
otherwise  the island begins to fill the screen and you  not  the 
best  of  swimmers  so  be  careful not  to  take  to  much  time 
collecting fruit etc.

  EFFECTS

  The  graphics  in this game look  are  reminiscent  to  Bubble-
Bobble.But  in this game the graphics are much better with  cuter 
sprites.Bub the hero looks very neat in his blue dunarees and red 
trainers and the enemies look so nice it is a shame killing  them 
as they look so good.Even the back drops look very good and  well 
drawn with good colour use.The rainbows you fire are much  better 
animated  than the bubbles you fired in the first game.The  title 
screen which was drawn in 16 colours looks very impressive with a 
picture  of  Bub  being  chased away by  an  array  of  different 
monsters.Things  certainly  don't deteriorate  from  there   with 
every  monster superbly animated with very good  detail.A  superb 
copy of the arcade even for the ST.
     The sound is very good at the beginning but it can become  a 
bit  tiresome so I would advise turning the sound down after  the 
first round or two.
