                       by Michael  Schuessler  (Sammy Joe) 

Along  with the disk magazine I will always try to bring you  the 
best  utilities which I am send.  So in this issue there  is  the 
ultimate packer by Automation. The program is on the disc in one 
of the folders. 

Let's get down to the actual review then.....

The packer has 5 different options, they are:

               1. Pack/Depack Program
               2. Pack/Depack Data Files
               3. Multi Pack Menu
                  1. Multi Pack All
                  2. Multi Pack but no Programs
                  3. Back to Main Menu
               4. Pack Data File (with an offset)
               5. Exit


1:
A  fileselector  box  comes up and you are asked to  click  on  a 
program  or tos file.  When you have clicked on it,  the  program 
will  load automationally.  You will then will be asked  how  you 
want the program packed.  Your choice goes from F1 to F10. If you 
press  F1,  the Packer will pack the program fast (and if  course 
the program will depack itself quite fast too),  but it will  not 
pack it very efficiently.  Whereas if you select F10, the packing 
will take years but the file will be a lot smaller. The depacking 
will  also  take an instant longer.  When the progam  is  totally 
packed the Packer will tell you how much it has packed!!! Finally 
you are asked under which name you want to save it.
If you have packed a program, you can depack it again by clicking 
on it.

2: 
The packing with the data files is merely the same except that at 
the end you are asked whether you want to save the data file as a 
program  or again as a data file.  If you choose to save it as  a 
program you are asked to type in at which address you would  like 
the program to depack itself to.  When the file is saved you will 
find it as a clickable .prg file on the disk. 
Again, as with 1. you can depack your data files again!!!!

3: 
This  here is quite a useful feature,  it saves you  clicking  on 
each  program.  If  you select Multi Pack All,  the  Packer  will 
automatically  pack  everything  on the  disc,  the  programs  as 
programs,  the data files as data files. If you choose Multi Pack 
No Programs,  the packer will just pack all the data files on the 
disk. 

4:
The fourth option is also quite useful.  You are asked to enter a 
offset, this offset (a number) tells the program how far into the 
data  file it should begin to pack.  For example,  if you have  a 
file  which is 350K long and the first 200K consist of a  sample, 
you enter the length of the sample and the program will only pack 
the graphix data beginning at the end of the sample.  I can  hear 
you ask,  isn't it easier to pack the whole file ?  My answer  to 
that  would be:  Samples do not pack very well and therefore  you 
save yourself a lot of time.

5:
I do not think that there is any need to explain what this does.


Finally  I  would like to thank Carormation for  allowing  me  to 
include this packer in the disk magazine.

                         Thanks guys....

P.S.: I personally reckon that this is the best Packer ever!!!!!!
P.P.S.: Thanks also go to whoever send it to me.
P.P.P.S.: The reason why this article in twice in this magazine 
	  fairly simple, I could not decide whether to put this
	  artcile in the utility section or the PD section, so
	  my decision was, put it in both. It looks like more too.
