
          CONQUEROR  by Maul the Wurf


STORY :
Here goes ...
Have  you ever wanted to be a " Panzer-Kommander ".  Well now  is 
your chance to actually drive and shoot in a German,  American or 
Soviet tank. 

Your  aim is as in most strategic games to destroy  or  overwhelm 
your foe. 

Although this does not sound too novel, CONQUEROR is different in 
several ways.  Firstly, it tries to be more than just simple tank 
simulation, aiming instead at addictive gameplay .

You  can choose between three modes of play which enable  you  to 
fight  according to your experience or simply according  to  your 
inclination.

The  first mode is the action game.  This is the easiest  of  the 
three, although it can hardly be described as being simple. In it 
you can blast away to your hearts desire ... until your ammo runs 
out.  Again that sounds quite simple.  After all,  you have got a 
radar in the top right corner.  The trouble is this radar  covers 
only a very slight part of the overall battle area.  Ignoring the 
fact  that  finding your enemiy is bound to give  some  sleepless 
minutes  (sometimes  the enemies find you  first  though...)  the 
control of the tank is one bugger to sort out (as was the one  in 
Braben's "Virus").  The programmer has defined about a dozen keys 
with which you will have to operate your tank tracks (left/right)
forward and backwards ,  your gun up and down as well as  turning 
clockwise and anti-clockwise.

Right,  what you do in the action mode is to find as many enemies 
and blast 'em to smithereens (don't mind the spelling).  What you 
do  with your points you (hopefully) will obtain I  will  explain 
later (So you've got to read on).

In  the attrition mode (which is an alliance between action  mode 
and strategy (all will be explained later on) mode) you will have 
a  standard force of one light ,  two medium and  two  heavy-duty 
machines-of-war   (meaning  tanks).   That  is  when   you   have 
accumulated  enough  points  to buy them .  You  start  with  one 
lightly-armoured,  quickly-inflammable tiny tank.  But if on  the 
off  chance  you manage to destroy an enemy you will be  able  to 
exchange  your vehicle into another better tank or if  your  have 
obtained  enough  points to buy another one and add  it  to  your 
collection.  If  on the other hand (perish the thought)  you  are 
blown  to  tiny chunks of metal,  points will be  deducted  (even 
minus  points added).  You can also program other tanks  in  your 
selection  to  race to a certain area which you can select  on  a 
map.  This map is an important piece of information, on which you 
€can sort out your attcks

All in all, the game is all right, it doesn't belong to the best, 
but it will still keep you happy for some time. 

What a shame that the game looks just like Virus.
