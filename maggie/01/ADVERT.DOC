                              by Sammy Joe

SPECIAL OFFER: THE DEF DEMO SOURCE CODE FOR          œ5
               THE POWER+MEGABANG SOURCE CODE FOR    œ5

Any screen in the MINDBOMB DEMO can be bought for   œ10
If you buy more than 2 screens, each following
screen will only cost you                           œ7.5
The only guest screen that can be bought is the 
one by BBC, it is also œ10.
The Lost Boys PD library is also selling other sources
from other crews like THE FINGERBOBS, THE OVERLANDERS. 
The Overlanders Source has just arrived and I have not
decided on the price yet, so look in a future PD list
or give me a phone call.

We do ask you not to spread our Source Code as we will not
sell it again in case that we find it anywhere.
  
For the rest of our stuff, look through the list (sorry 
that it is such a mess but I just took it out of my PD 
list program).                                  

A already had some complaints of friends of ours who also
run Pd libraries that we always advertise for our PD
library and that it isn't fair !!!But then again we must
live too and we do not make any profit anyway!!!!!
