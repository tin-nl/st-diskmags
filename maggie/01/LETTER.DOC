                 Letter to FAST

I received this letter some days ago. It appears that someone has 
already heard about my article on FAST in this issue and here  is 
what that guy has to say to FAST:
This  letter might be offensive to some readers,  but here it  is 
anyway:

 
Fast is really just a joke!  They are full of trash,  they always 
play up that they are doing a great job and "STOP THE DOWNFALL OF 
THE  SOFT-WARE  INDUSTRY"...   I  say..  BULL!!  As  I  sit  here 
surrounded by Pirate disks,  Compact Disks, pirate videos etc.. I 
see no why I am harming the industry! 

I know one programmer who has wrote a game, he has lots of pirate 
disks and is even in a crew! He has put his own game on his menu!
He knows its just a load of bull saying that piracy is distroying
the software trade, its not.   

OK to put my point across here is an example:-

4th May '90   I received a pirate copy of F-29 Retaliator...
5th  May '90  I was totally "MINDBOMBED" by it I took 30 quid  
              from my  bank account.
6th  May '90  Went to town to buy the original,  they were  sold 
              out!
10th May'90   Went again, and bought F-29 retaliator !

....  the point here is that if a game is good enough, weather we 
have pirates or not,  we will buy the original, there is no way I 
would buy the original of Microprose Soccer  (one),  Alf,  Galaxy 
Force  2,  Death  star or Bad company (to  name  a  few),  simply 
because they are a load of.. (can I swear ?) CRAP!!!

I  have a few originals of games I thought were good and  decided 
that they deserved to be bought!  They are:
Police Quest,  Police Quest II,  Kings Quest IV,  Dungeon Master, 
Chaos Strikes Back,  Degas Elite,  Cyber Paint,  Stunt Car Racer, 
Corruption, Kick Off, Extra Time, Defender of the Crown and Blood 
Money..

I'm   sure your readers (hello readers!) would agree with me  and 
say that these games are worth the hard earned pieces of  paper.. 
I  have bought a few games that I have formatted after 2  minutes 
of  playing  the game because it was total  SHITE!!  these  are: 
Academy, Music

Construction  Kit,  Run the gauntlet,  Side Winder  etc...  After 
buying  these I realised I could get them all one one  disk  with 
great musix,  grafix and intros,  fully packed,  hacked and  with 
cheat modes all on one disk!!  I know I said they were trash, but 
for 30p to buy a disk to get the cracked ones I think they  would 
be bearable..

The  only  programmers  who  suffer  are  the  CRAP  ONES!!  Take 
THALION...  I love TCB, TEX demos etc.. and the games are Brill!! 
I have copies of these games,  but because they are good I am  at 
the moment saving up to buy the originals..  This is because they 
are GOOD!!                         [Well done Thalion]


As  for  fast playing us that they do everything its  a  load  of 
BULL!  take that raid for example.  The one where 40 Hackers  got 
busted.  They got busted by B.T.  for using Black Boxes and phone 
freaking,  FAST were only told about the raids a week before  the 
raid,  not as they say March last year!  Its in C.T.W.  that FAST 
has  mastermided the whole thing and had passed  the  info.  onto 
B.T.,  Bob H.  took all the credit for this...  I say to you BOB, 
You  are  a  wan***,  come on here (LOST  BOYS  MAG)  and  defend 
youself!! You had nothing to do with the raids!


It will be intersting to see if he does, it will prove whether he 
did or did not know about the raids....


OK Readers...  Lets have a poll...
Vote...  1. Would you get pirates and if the games were good get 
            the originals?
        2.  Would you just pirate?
        3.  Are you totaly against all this(In which case why are 
            you reading this letter... LAMER!!), and would just 
            continue buying originals?

I hope that THE LOST BOYS will let this poll take place, and publish
this letter and the results...

                              
                              Signed:   I.AM.ANOMAUS!!
