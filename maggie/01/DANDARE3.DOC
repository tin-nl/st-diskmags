
DAN DARE III,THE ESCAPE! BY BEN DOLLEY

 The story so far:Dan Dare after was really happy after banishing 
the  evil Xenobs from the good planet Duoning, so happy in  fact 
that he had invited his good friend  Digby tomorrow evening for a 
meal.
  While  he was thinking what to cook there was a  knock  on  the 
door.He  opened it and there stood before him was a Xenob  bounty 
hunter,before Dan could do any thing the Xenob smashed him  round 
the  head and  put  him in his  space craft and  flew back to his 
planet  Xenobian.So  all  Dan  now how to  do  was  steal  a  jet 
pack,some  cash,  a  space craft and fly back to  met  Digby  for 
dinner.Dan  has  already stolen the jet pack,a  plasma  rifle and  
found a space ship,but the space ship hasn`t any fuel.So all  you 
have to do now is find some fuel and fly back to Earth.This might 
sound easy,but it isn`t so be warned.... 
   
                      ***********************              

  As you probably have already gathered you play play the role of 
Dan Dare.His role is to fly around each warp looking for fuel and 
killing  any  aliens in sight.Dan is armed with  a  basic  plasma 
rifle which is loaded with 99 shots,but this can be increased  by 
finding  plasma guns  which give you an extra 30  shots.You  also 
have  stolen  a jet pack which you need to fly  around  with,when 
this runs out you can`t fly so your probably going to die.
  You have 4 lives each one has a certain amount of energy  which 
is  reduced by running into bullets and hitting aliens.Once  your 
energy  is  down to nothing as you might of  guessed  you  die.To 
complete a level you need to kill the main monster who is  pretty 
hard,collect a pod which it leaves you and fly back to  something 
that looks exactly the same as the pod but enlarged.You then come 
to some thing quite nasty, a tunnel which you have to fly in  the 
centre  of unless you want to fly outside and lose energy  pretty 
quickly.Complete that and your at the next level.
  Other weapons can be bought from level 1 from a computer  these 
include smart bombs,homing missiles,extra  lives,bouncing  bombs,
an  item  which  freezes the aliens for a set  period  of  time,a 
shield,extra  ammo  for your plasma rifle and a  blast  off  item 
which  when  you have got 50 pounds of fuel lets  you  escape.The 
prices  range from $1000 to $50,extra cash is given to  you  each 
time you kill an alien.You can go to level 1 any time you want as 
you  keep  the pod which lets you go there as this  is  the  only 
place you can buy extra weapons and the blast off item.Some times 
you  you look around and can find no way out this is because  you 
need to pull a lever by pushing down,this then opens a small door 
which you the have to go and find. 
 
DIFFERENT WEAPONS 

Bouncing  Bombs  :These are slow firing round bombs  that  bounce 
around the screen until they hit something.

Homing  Missiles:These are probably the best weapon as they  fire 
quickly and home in on the nearest enemy.

Plasma  Rifle:This  is the basic weapon but it  is  still  pretty 
good.It can be built up so it fires one mega shot or you can fire 
quick low powered shots.

  EFFECTS

  The  graphics in this game are very good except maybe  for  the 
poor  scenery  which doesn`t look very good.The game has  a  very 
well  looking title screen with some good speech.The sound  track 
is pretty funky and like most games these days the sound  doesn`t 
get tiresome.
