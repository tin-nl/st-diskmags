
SHINOBI BY BEN DOLLEY

  Once upon a time Shinobi being a star was a guest in his  local 
primary  school.While he was showing off some of his ninja  magic 
there was a sudden bang and out from the cloud of smoke  appeared 
his worst enemy Wakasaki who froze Shinobi and said,"I will  make 
you  pay  for what you you did to my brother  Nakasaki!"and  with 
that  he kidnapped the class which Shinobi had been teaching  and 
disappeared.
   When the kids' parents found out what had happened  they  told 
Shinobi   to   rescue  their  kids  or  he  would   be   in   big 
trouble,Shinobi not having much choice decided that would be  the 
best thing to do and so off he went.(I know that wasn't much of a 
story ,but it's all that the game really deserves!)

                      **********************

   Shinobi is a horizontally scrolling beat-em-up type game.(Note 
that  I  said,"Type game!"because Shinobi being so  crap  doesn't 
deserve  much else!).You play Shinobi who's aim is to go  through 
each  level  rescuing the hostages.You start off with  the  basic 
throwing  star,but  it can be upgraded to  a  gun,the  difference 
being the big men with shields can't deflect them.
   There are 6 missions in all each with 3 or 4 levels at the end 
of each mission there is a main enemy to defeat which range  from 
a  fire hurling armour clad ninja,a helicopter,the leading  ninja 
and 16 revolving Bhudas.To complete the level you have to  rescue 
all  the hostages and then reach the exit.You also have a  single 
ninja magic which acts as a smart bomb killing every thing on the 
screen apart from the hostages.
 
 ENEMIES

THUGS:These are one of the most common enemies who can fire  guns 
and only take a single shot to destroy.

THUGS2:These are useless people who have no weapon and just  walk 
across the screen(Totally incapable of doing anything!)

 I can`t be bothered to do any more so I've decided you can  find 
them out for yourselves O.K.

 
 EFFECTS

Absolutely totally BLOODY useless(sorry for swearing,but that  is 
all i could saw really.I'am sure you will understand if you  have 
unfortunately  bought this crap game!)the scrolling is  awful.The 
game  seems  to  be in slow motion and the  sprites  are  totally 
useless.The  sound  is for this game is totally the same  as  the 
Amstrad(crap!).
