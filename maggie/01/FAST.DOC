
          ALL YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT  F.A.S.T.,  
          BUT WERE AFRAID  TO ASK ?  

What  exactly does the abbreviation FAST mean ?  Well,  after  my 
long interview (which you will be able to read a bit further  on) 
I  found  out  that it stands for   

               Federation  Against  Software  Theft. 

In  this article we will tell you all your heart ever desired  to 
know about FAST, like for example,  the way they get you when you 
copy  loadsa pirated software.  This article will also  tell  you 
about the penalties which will be inflicted upon you on  breaking 
the code of justice (Justice For All).  You will also get to know 
the way FAST operates and many more hopefully interesting  facts. 
Anyway,  let's  stop  all that drivel and get  down  to  business 
(Killing is my business and business is good !!!

First Try (Monday, 9th April '90):

Beeeeeeeep....beeeeeeeep......beeeeeeeep.......
- Hello, this is FAST    (says a nice, warm femine voice)   
- I am intending to write an article for my Diskmagazine  and  I 
  was  wondering  whether  I could ask you  a  few  questions  ? 
  (Michael Schuessler (Sammy Joe) & Oliver Wagner (Maulwurf). 
- Oh,  I am so sorry,  but I will not be able to be a lot of help 
  to you.  Could you please phone back on Wednesday and ask  for 
  Bob Hay.  
- Thanks, bye....


Second Try (Wednesday, 11th April '90):

Beeeeeeeep....beeeeeeeep......beeeeeeeep.......
- FAST, good  afternoon  (this time a male voice  sounds  through  the 
  phone).
- Could I speak to Bob Hay, please ?
- Who is speaking, please ?
- This  is Michael.  I rang earlier this week  about  having  an 
  interview with FAST. 
- What's you company ?
- No company, but for my (groovy) Diskmagazine.
                         .
                         .
                         .
  Mr B.  Hay was rather busy having an appoinment........ We were 
  told to try again in the afternoon.


Third Try (still Wednesday, 11th April):

Beeeeeeeep....beeeeeeeep......beeeeeeeep.......
A  nice  lady  picks up the phone again....and  finally  puts  us 
€through to Mr Bob Hay and....our interview is ready to begin:

D(isk)M(aggy):  Hello,  this  is Michael  Schuessler  again.  You 
                remember that I am running a PD-Diskmagazine....
FAST: All right, you wanted to ask me a few questions about FAST.
      The PD I take it stands for Public Domain ?

DM  : Yes,  it certainly does ! My first question is: Since when 
      does FAST exist ?

FAST: Since 1984, July 1984 to be precise.

DM  : What are your aims ?

FAST: We are concerned with three different subjects.  First  of 
      all, we intend to protect the intellectual property rights 
      of our member companies. That means that we get evidence of 
      infringement,  then we take whatever action is appropriate. 
      Whether  that be by prosecuting those  responsible  through   
      the criminal courts or by dealing with it in any other way, 
      then  whatever is the most appropriate reason we  take  it. 
      This we do with the full consent and after consulting  with 
      our member companies.

DM  : Could you give me some examples in which you had success ?

FAST: We have  prosecuted  over 30 odd cases of criminal  piracy, 
      for example, one individual operating in the name Cybersoft 
      out  of  Reading  who was prosecuted and  fined  œ12000  in 
      Reading  Crown Court for illegal importation  of  software 
      from abroad and selling it in this country.  He was getting 
      the software from the Far East and selling it complete with 
      manual. 
      In  another case which was identical to  that,  the  person 
      responsible  was  operating out of Torquay and he  went  to 
      prison for 12 months. 
      In January of this year two directors of a company that was 
      operating  first of all in Cornwall and them moved  to  the 
      Midlands   were  both  sentenced  4  months   imprisonment, 
      suspended for two years. 
      LAST  WEEK,  acting  with No.  5 Regional Crime  Squad  and 
      BRITISH  TELECOM  Special  Investigation  Branch  we   were 
      involved  in  a raid that was carried out in  13  different 
      locations  up  and down the country and in  each  case  the 
      suspects were arrested and are currently on police bail. 

DM  : What is now going to happen to them ?

FAST: They will be charged with a variety of offences.

DM  : Why did you work together with BRITISH TELECOM ? 

FAST: The  allegation  was that they were making illegal  use  of 
      devices to bypass the payment on the B.T.'s  Network.  They 
€      were doing what is called phreaking.........
   
There  was  a slight disturbance then,  because my dad  came  and 
asked  us where our dog was hiding (yo' Poldi (that's  short  for 
Leopold),  where  are  you?) Finally,  after disturbing  the  dog 
flirting  with  our  neighbours  dog we  could  go  on  with  the 
interview !!!!

FAST: Another  situation  is  that we  deal  with,  for  example, 
      commercial organizations who are hiring out software  which 
      is  against  the new  Copyright  laws,  which  specifically 
      denies the right of any person to hire software without the 
      consent of the Copyrighter.  That is,  I  mean,  commercial 
      hiring as opposed to public lending. 
      Obviously  we  deal with cooperate piracy  or  fraud  where 
      overuse of software takes places meaning where they buy one 
      program and copy it onto a number of different machines. In 
      that respect we have actually  taken up the matter up  with 
      South End Borough Council who we found were making  illegal 
      use  of  software  and  they  very  readily  and  helpfully 
      responded by actually taking the proper steps.    
      We  have  a couple of colleges in England and  Wales  where 
      auditing  of  software is being carried out  at  this  very 
      moment in time.  
      We  were  responsible for the first amendment  to  the  1956 
      Copyright Act uppertaining to computer software,  in  other 
      words  it  was FAST who were responsible for  the  lobbying 
      which  resulted in the 1985 amendment act and that for  the 
      first time offered the protection of Copyright to  computer 
      software.    
      Then  fourthly,  last  but not least by probably  the  most 
      important factor was taking the various necessary steps  to 
      heighten  the awareness of people to the  obligations  they 
      have to the Copyright, so as not to break the law.       
      We  work  with the European Publisher  Association  in  the 
      leisure sector and we have associate members of FAST in the 
      business sector.  We have,  for example, Computing Services 
      Association,   Electronic  Engineering   Association,   the 
      British Computer Society and various other trade bodies who 
      are  all  associated with membership  of  FAST.  All  these 
      companies support us.
      In  that respect it is quite a good example of the way  the 
      industry responds

DM  : Does FAST deal worldwide with software theft ?

FAST: No,  FAST only deals with the United Kingdom,  although  we 
      work  closely with the Business Software Alliance who  deal 
      with piracy on an international scale.  They have a  London 
      office,  which has just been set up last month and although 
      they  do  not take action in the United Kingdom  they  have 
      been quite active across Europe. 
      We  also work with the Software Publishers Association  who 
      have  set up an office in Paris.  Both those  organisations 
€      are also based in Washington D.C.. 
      We have contacts with companies in Spain,  SPDLM in France, 
      Cosso (we did not quite know how to spell that,  so do  not 
      blame  us if we got it wrong) Holland,  SUS in Denmark  and 
      Dimick  in  Sweden.  And  so  we have  a  number  of  loose  
      associations  with  European  trade  organisations,   which 
      aren't specificially anti-piracy bodies as we are. 
      In December some pirated software turned up in Spain  which 
      had  originated  allegedly  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The 
      evidence was passed to us from Spain and with the UK police 
      we  took the necessary steps to bust the people at  the  UK 
      end. 
      We  have  written to the Dutch association  Cosso  to  seek 
      their cooperation in dealing with an organisation which  is 
      primarily   based   in   Holland,    although   they   have 
      representatives in this country which is a cracking team of 
      hackers called Quartex and hopefully when we get sufficient 
      evidence  we will be in a position to take  action  against 
      them. 

DM  : Is FAST subsidized by the government ?

FAST: We are a non-profit making organisation and all our members 
      pay  fees  on  a  sliding  scale.   For  example  IBM  pays 
      "slightly"  more  than a small  company  producing  leisure 
      software. 

DM  : Which computers do you actually cover ?

FAST: Many different computers.

DM  : What  happens to the confiscated hard- and  software  after     
      raiding a suspected pirate ?

FAST: We will seize their hard- and software. We then examine it, 
      have the proof available,  that the hardware was being used 
      in  the  propagation of pirated software.  For  example  we 
      confiscated  a  40MB  harddisk which was  full  of  illegal 
      software,   which  was  basically  a  library  of  software 
      programs,  that  were being actively sold by  a  particular 
      company in the home counties. 

DM  : After  a person has been convicted and his fine  payed  get 
      his soft- and hardware back ?

FAST: The  software is  confiscated and the court  exercises  his 
      discretion with the hardware.  That means,  if the court is 
      satisfied,  that the offender will not use the hardware  to 
      trade in illegal software. 

DM  : How many people are employed by FAST ?

FAST: Oh, we are very small, very small indeed. There are five of 
      us.
€
DM  : What is your personal opinion on piracy ?
      
FAST: Quite simply piracy is theft !! 

DM  : But  don't  you  think  that most of the games are sold  at  
      an artificially inflated price (~ œ25) ?   As I think  that 
      most  of  the  ST  users  are aged  10  to  18  and  to  my 
      knowledge most of them don't work, something should be done 
      to lower the price of computer software.  Aren't you of the 
      opinion  that it would be more acceptable to both  consumer 
      and producer if the software would be sold at ~œ10.

FAST: Why don't you talk to Virgin Mastertronic then and ask them 
      why  their  Budget Software gets pirated just  as  much  as 
      their better or their more expensive products ? 
      Let me tell you one more thing. The most pirated software I 
      have ever come across is a program called Copy 2  PC.  What 
      is Copy 2 PC all about ? It is about removing the technical 
      protection which is used to protect computer  software.  An 
      yet  they  don't even want to pay for  that.  It  could  be 
      described  as a tool that is in the tool box  of  virtually 
      every  pirate.  If you look at the business  software  end, 
      disk  utility  programs  such  as  Northern  Utilities   or 
      Sidekick  or  other devices of that nature  get  even  more 
      pirated than business software.  
      If you say that kids can't afford to buy software you  must 
      also look at the fact that they can't afford to keep  Polar 
      Ponies.  Does  this justify them in going out and  stealing 
      Polar  Ponies  for  use  ?  
      In general,  there can be no moral judgement, that intitles 
      anyone  to  breach the law and that is my view  for  having 
      been  a police officer for the last 30 years and I  am  not 
      about to change my opinion now.    
      The  only justification that hackers try to put forward  is 
      that they see hacking into a program as more of a challenge 
      than  playing or using a program.  But ultimatly what  will 
      happen  is  that there will be fewer  and  fewer  companies 
      producing software.  Not every software publisher is a  big 
      fat cat.  There are many modes companies especially in  the 
      leisure  sector who have a very significant problem  making 
      ends  meet.  Is  that because they  are  overpricing  their 
      goods ? 

DM  : There are many hackers who convert games which do not  work 
      on the Atari ST to the STE. After they have done that, they 
      send  the modified version of the game back to the  company 
      and  ask  if  the company is willing to pay  the  hacker  a 
      certain amount of money. 

FAST: The simple answer to that is,  that the only person who  is 
      allowed  to  make  an  adaptation  to  a  program  is   the 
      Copyrightor  or a person with his consent.  If  the  hacker 
      were to approach the company with his copy,  asking them if 
€      he could adapt it to a different machine and if the company   
      were  to  agree,  the hacker would be allowed to  do  these 
      adaptations.  If  contrarily without permission they  adapt 
      the  program,  then automatically that program is owned  by 
      the Copyrightor,  even though he has not lifted one  finger 
      to do that conversion,  simply because that is what the law 
      says. 

DM  : Thanks a lot then Mr Hay. Bye....


The time is now 3.55am.  Oliver (Maulwurf) and I (Sammy Joe) have 
been  working up to now to get this interview finished.  We  have 
been  working  up to now because Oliver is going back  to  Geneva 
tomorrow (uuups, that should be today). 

While doing this article we used up:  - a 2 litre  bottles  of 
                                        coke
                                      - a lot of biscuits
                                      - half a role  of  toilet 
                                        paper
                                      - one disk
                                      - some beer
CD's and tapes we listened to:        - Metallica
                                      - Spermbirds
                                      - Overkill
                                      - Kylie Minogue (Great !!)
                                      - Faith No More
                                      - Kreator & Megadeth

Anyway, I am feeling absolutely necked, by now the time is 4.15pm 
and  we  are about to go to bed (we have to get  up  at  8am.  So 
finally I would like to thank Mr Rob Hay for giving us this great 
interview.

                                Sammy Joe of TLB & Maulwurf
