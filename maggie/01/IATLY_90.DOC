About  2 or 3 months ago a game of the same name was released  (a 
bit early for the world cup eh?), it was a total FLOP! It was yet
another football game, it did have a few nice touches like the 3D
or head on display as you took a shot or saved a shot. But anyway 
I'm not here to talk about Italy 1990 (yes you are,  ed).  Oh yes 
so I am thanx..

Ok  here  is the game with the same name (hey I'm a  poet  and  I 
didn't  know  it!).  This is the Italy 1990 from US Gold  and  is 
quite a good offering. 

Once  the  game has loaded you are presented with  an  electronic 
score board that scrolls though the credits.  Press fire and  you 
are presented with a rather dashing menu to choose you options.

You can have a 1 or 2 player friendly, play the world cup, change
match time or load a previously saved game.

In the friendly you choose you team (out of all the teams entered 
in  the world cup) and the other play (if there is  one)  chooses 
his/her team.  Once this is done a TV presenter sitting behind  a 
desk  with his script comes up and on the TV behind him (hey  its 
ITN!) comes up all the details about the match,  who is  playing, 
where,  when (why,  ed) and the favourites to win. Press fire and 
it's off to wemberly (er no actually it'ss Rome, ed)

OK the teams come out in there kit and you start playing.  But if 
you  are a big noise and you went for the Play World  Cup  Option 
then  you are presented with a selection of formations to  choose 
from:  4-4-3 3-4-4 4-3-4 5-3-2 etc...  Choose your formation  and 
then  you get a picture of your half of the pitch and a  list  of 
all the players in your team (the actual players too,  oh  goodie 
gum drops!), on the little picture there is a red dot showing the 
position  of the player to choose (i.e.  Goal  keeper,  Defender, 
Midfield  etc...  Choose  the  players  you  want  and  click  on 
finished.  The  teams  now  come out onto the  pitch  with  there 
proper  colours  (they always were white  shorts  though!),  the 
whistle goes to kick off and your off...

The actual game of football its self is good.  Its nice and fast, 
its not to "uncontrollable" ,  but the difficulty level is  quite 
low,  I  scored 9 goals past U.S.S.R.  in the final,  and  I  was 
Rumania! (or is that just because I'm a Liverpool fan?)

You have all the options, penalties, free kicks, though ins,etc.. 
and I well like the penalties,  you can even have extra time,  red 
and yellow cards its great!

This  is  definitely a great game and number one  this  world  cup 
side!

Will Kick Off 2 be any better?  (its 1 meg only thought)
