                              Review by Michael Schuessler

I received this demo today so I decided to review it. As you have 
probably  guessed,  the sample is of Aerosmith,  it it  of  their 
latest album. Do you know what it is ? I will give you a hint, it 
is a dirty song,  yeeeeees,  it is "Love in an Elevator".   Great 
song that. 

The reason why this demo is so late is, that NOD managed to blank 
his sample.  He has finally managed to resample it (well, it took 
him long enough). 

Well,   I  just  had a very interesting phone call,  it  was  MAX 
HEADROOM from Sewer Software,  anyway,  back to the demo  review. 
Where were we? Ah, NOD managed to resample everything and put his 
demo together!!

This is what happens when you switch your computer on:

The screen stays white,  ..........,  after 30 sec the screen has 
not  changed but you can hear the disk drive ticking  away!!!  At 
least you know that something is happening. 

What happened ?  It  is finally loaded,  the screen is now  black 
and some text appears on the screen.  It is supposed to look like 
the text fades out,  but it takes a bit too long.  Some more text 
fades in an out, yawnnnn.

Yeah,  a picture fades in (this time quite fast).  The picture is 
of  a very good looking woman (great picture).  When  the  sample 
starts  you  get slightly disappointed,  although the  sample  is 
quite  loud  (which does not happen too often) there is  so  much 
fuss in the background that it does spoil the sample a  bit.  The 
worst bit of this demo is when it changes samples. As the demo is 
written in STOS, you get an enormous click. My comment to that is 
Arrrrrghhhhhhh.  Still,  if  you turn the volume of your  monitor 
down,  the  fuss  and the clicks step in the background  and  you 
notice something else:

There  is  something moving up and down on the left side  of  the 
screen, god, that's disgusting. Sorry, I really can't tell you. 
What,  you are desperate ?  Ok,  if you are under 10 (or have not 
had your puberty yet) read on in the next paragraph.  On the left 
side there is an elevator moving up and down!!!!  If you know the 
video  of  the song,  you must know what they are  doing  in  the 
elevator.  You  do not know the video,  all right then  they  are 
having  INTERCOURSE  (now for the ones reading this  who  do  not 
understand  this  word,  basically they are having a  FUCK.)  Now 
while  the scrolline is moving up and down some man has a  sexual 
relationship with a woman. The animation is very nice. 

Good  of you to read on here if you are under  10,  you  probably 
would not have understood the above paragraph anyway. On the left 
side  of the screen there is an elevator moving up and down  with 
some nice animations within the elevator. Great that.

This  last bit,  the animation,  makes the demo a lot  better,  I 
reckon  that it makes up for the bad sample!!!!!  And  here's  my 
summary:
