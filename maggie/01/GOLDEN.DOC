
GOLDEN OLDIES BY BEN DOLLEY 

   In  this article I am going to review some old games  just  in 
case you are deciding on buying an old game and want to know what 
it's like.Here is just a selection:

Gauntlet II By U.S. Gold 

   In this game you can play with up to 4 players on 1 screen  in 
which  case  you need a special piece of  machinery  which  costs 
around  5  pounds.The idea of the game is to guide  your  players 
through  over 100 levels finding a small exit square to  complete 
each one.You start with 2000 health points which can be increased 
by  food or cider.However you occasionally come  across  poisoned 
cider  which  takes  off  100  points.You  can  play  either   an 
elf,warrior or a women fighter.Each has varying amounts of armour 
which  takes of 10,20 or 30 percent of the  monsters  hits,weapon 
power,magic  power  and  shot speed.These  can  be  increased  by 
finding  potions.You  must find keys to open doors  and  treasure 
chests.The    treasure   chests   when   opened   give   you    a 
key,food,treasure  which gives you 100 points or death which  can 
take off health points by touch and can only be killed by magic. 
   This might sound easy but the one main problem is the monsters 
which   take  off   varying amount of health points.The  monsters 
include ghosts,thugs,demons and lobbers.The monsters come out  of 
generators  which  determine if the monsters can take  1,2  or  3 
hits.

  EFFECTS

The game has some good sampled speech and other sound effects.The 
graphics are reasonably good,but the  scrolling is a bit of a let 
down when you are playing with 2 or more players.

NOTE:I  played  it for 8 hours and only got to level 106  so  the 
game can be a bit on the boring side.  

   A  cheat:When coming to a treasure chest hold the  insert  key 
down  just before opening it and when you come to  another  chest 
hold down the help key and open it.Then you will be rewarded with 
50,000  health and mega shots which go through all  monsters,food 
etc.

R-TYPE BY ELECTRIC DREAMS

   R-Type  is  a horizontally blast  everything  in  sight  while 
collecting  extra weapons game.The aim of the the game is  to  go 
through 8 levels and kill the end of level nasty.Your basic  ship 
is  armed  with a puny cannon,but you can soon get  upgrades  the 
first being a small orb which can protect you from bullets and is 
invincible.Other    upgrades   include    bouncing    lasers,mega 
cannon,fire  which  crawls along the  wall and small  orbs  which 
protect you and fire when the mega cannon is in use.
  Each of the 8 levels contains a large monster at the end,which 
take multiple shots to destroy in its weak spot.Some monsters can 
take  varying amounts of shots to kill,but the most  common  only 
take a single shot to destroy.

  EFFECTS

The  aliens  are  quite well drawn  but  nothing  really  special 
although  the  backdrops look unusually good.The  sound  is  also 
nothing special.

OPERATION WOLF BY OCEAN

   This game goes through 6 levels in which you have to shoot all 
the  ememy  men,planes  and  tanks with the  help  of  the  small 
targeter  controlled  by the mouse.You have a limited  amount  of 
magazines  which  contain  about 30  bullets  and  rockets  which 
destroy anything in a certain radius.You have an energy bar which 
starts of all blue,but goes red when you are hit although it  can 
be reduced by shooting a small item with the letter P on it.
   Along  the way you can collect  extra  magazines,missiles  and 
extra  health.At  the  end of the level some of  your  energy  is 
reduced,but  at  the end of the third stage which  is  relatively 
easy most of your wounds are healed.

 EFFECTS

The  scrolling  is  very  smooth which is good  to  see  and  the 
graphics are also very well drawn.The sound is also very good  to 
listen to,all the effects in this game are very well done.

 DOGS OF WAR BY ELITE

   Dogs  of  war  is  a  vertically  and  horizontally  scrolling 
2  player  blast them to bits game.At the beginning  you  have  a 
choice  of  missions  each giving various amounts  of  cash  when 
completed,the harder the mission the more money you get.
    After  you have chosen your mission you are  allowed  to  buy 
weapons  ranging from a colt.44 to a portable flame cannon  which 
burns every thing in sight.Then you can get on with the fun  part 
of  the  game  blowing the enemies to bits.Luckily  for  you  the 
enemies  aren't very intelligent as all they seem to do  is  fire 
and  walk  in a straight line.Other things to watch out  for  are 
mines,trucks,cars,grenade  throwers,all these can,t be killed  by 
normal  bullets  so  have  be destroyed  by  grenades  or  rocket 
launchers.

  EFFECTS

   The title  screen graphics and music are some of the best I've 
seen for a reasonably old game like this.The bits of sound i like 
a lot is the enemy men dying,also the graphics are very good  and 
detailed.

walk over mines.
