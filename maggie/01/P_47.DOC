  Have you ever wanted to change the course of World War  II,well 
now you can change it as much as you want with  Firebirds release 
of the game P-47.The strange things are that if you die the Nazis 
take over and if you win the allied forces are victorious so  now 
you no how important it is not to die,got it!...

                    *************************

  P-47 is a horizontally scrolling shot-em-up.You play an  allied 
fighter who has to blow as many enemy tanks,planes and trucks  as 
you  can.The game takes play over France each new level  being  a 
different part.
 You start off with a single front firing cannon,but it can  soon 
be  upgraded  by  the  different  tokens  left  behind  by   dead 
helicopters.These  include  missiles,bullets  that  fire  in  the 
direction  your going,bombs,missiles that split up  into  smaller 
shells about have way across the screen,extra lives and speed. 
 The main enemies are planes which come in units of usually about 
10  to 15 an only take a single shot to destroy.Occasionally  you  
come  across bigger planes which take more shots to  kill.At  the 
end  of  each level you come across a bigger  and  nastier  enemy 
which takes lots and lots of shots to kill,they  include a  train 
with lots of gun emplacements and a giant plane that fires  loads 
of shots in order to kill you.

  EFFECTS

    I`m really getting bored with this part so all I`m  going  to 
say is that the graphics,sound and scrolling are all very good.
