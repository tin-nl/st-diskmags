
BLACK TIGER BY BEN DOLLEY

 
   Middle-Earth was a peaceful place in the year 1486,Saraman had 
been  defeated  and  evil had been driven back  into  the  black-
lands.The  Hobbits,Dwarfs,Elves  and Humans were  all  happy  and 
living  in peace with each other.Suddenly at 4.15 hobbit time  on 
the  fourteenth  day of April in the year 1486 the whole  of  the 
Empire  heard  a huge explosion and it soon was  known  that  the 
warp-gates  that kept the forces of Chaos out had  collapsed  and 
the  forces  of chaos soon swept in.Powerful demons  hurled  fire 
balls  at  anything  that  got in  there  way.Warriors  of  chaos 
pillaged  and  burnt towns,villages and  farms.Evil  wizards  had 
powers  even to raise the dead and make terrifying undead  armies 
that conquered fortresses and castles.When the Empire had  almost 
given  up hope there came from the far lands of Norsca a  warrior 
of  good  clad in the finest mail and the the  hardest  plate  he 
wielded  a huge mourning-star.His thoughts were to rid the  lands 
of chaos and his name was Black-Tiger.

Black-Tiger is a horizontally and vertically scrolling kill every 
thing in sight game.You play the role of a warrior called  Black-
Tiger  who is armed with a ball and chain,throwing daggers  which 
fire  in  three directions and enough armour to  with  stand  the 
first two hits of the game.The idea is guide him round each level 
killing all monsters in sight with either your daggers which  are 
unlimited  and  fire  across the whole screen,but  are  not  very 
powerful.Also you can kill them with your ball and chain which is 
more  powerful than the daggers,but only has a limited  range  of 
use.Occasionally  you come across frozen wizards which have  been 
put  under  a  spell,a  simple touch will  turn  them  back  into 
normal  wizards they then reward you with either some  cash,extra 
time  or health potions.Once a level 1 wizard will allow  you  to 
buy something from him.The items range from a set of five weapons 
which  range from 1000 cash to 9600 cash the more  expensive  the 
weapon  the  better  range and power it has the  last  one  being 
very,very  powerful.You  can also buy a range of  five  different 
suits  of armour which give varying amounts  of  protection.Other 
items  you can buy include health potions and keys.Keys are  used 
for opening treasure chests which find occasionally.These need to 
be  opened  by a key once opened they either reveal  some  cash,a 
health potion or some fire which takes some energy away from  you 
and  can get a bit frustrating.Each monster you kill gives you  a 
varying  amount  of cash which in this game is  called  zenny  it 
ranges  from  1  zenny  to  a huge  100  zenny  for  the  hardest 
monster.Sometimes you come across pots which when hit twice leave 
you either some cash,a health potion,a key or some very  annoying 
blue  drips  which take quite a lot  of hits to kill  and  don`t 
even  leave you any zenny.Black-Tiger has three lives,but  a  set 
number  of energy bars for each life which can be increased  with 
the  help  of  health potions.Once a level  you  come  across  an 
€entrance with the words dungeon on it.If you enter you find a lot 
of treasure chests which usually give you fire,but they also give 
you  in  the the dungeon quite a lot of pots which  do  give  you 
quite a lot of zenny.If die during your visit to the dungeon  you 
automatically  get transported out and can`t enter again so  make 
sure  you have plenty of energy when entering the dungeon.At  the 
the end of each level you are faced with what look like a pile of 
boulders but when you get close enough to them they start to move 
around  these  do take a lot of shots to  kill,but  luckily  just 
before  your  going  to  meat  them  you  are  given  some  bonus 
energy.The  amount of monsters increase at the end of  the  level 
depending  on  what level your on.If and when you kill  them  you 
have  completed  the  level and rewarded with  some  zenny  which 
increases depending which level you have completed.There is  only 
one  way to find the way to the end of level which can  be  quite 
difficult to find.      

  ENEMIES

WARRIORS:These monsters are the most common of the game they only 
take  a  few  shots to kill and leave you when dead  a  10  zenny 
piece.Altogether these are a relatively easy monster to kill.

SNAKES:These  monsters  aren`t  very common and  are  only  found 
clinging  on  from  pipes.They take less hits to  kill  than  the 
warriors,but  if  you hit into them apart from  taking  off  some 
energy  they give you some poison which makes you unable to  fire 
your daggers.These monsters can be a pain.

PLANTS:These  monsters aren`t very common which is just  as  well 
because they can prove a problem they go in and out of the ground 
and do take quite a lot of shots to dispose of them.Luckily  they 
don`t  fire at you,but when touched take off one piece of  energy 
and give you poison.They leave 50 zenny when dead.

SKELETONS:These are very common on later levels.They just pop  up 
out  of the ground and walk towards you and only take one to  die 
and only leave you 1 zenny.These can become very annoying as  you 
don`t know when there going to pop up.

DEMONS:These  just  pop  up out of no  where  usually  and  start 
hurling  fire-balls at you.They can become very difficult as  the 
fire-balls explode and leave an area of flames for a few  seconds 
which if run into take off a unit of energy.They take quite a few 
shots to kill and leave 50 zenny when dead.

LARGE  DEMONS:These  don`t  turn up very often  and  do  prove  a 
problem.They take a lot of hits to destroy and breath a long line 
of  flames at you while flying around the screen.They take a  lot 
of shots to kill and leave a huge 100 zenny if you kill them.


    The graphics are very good in this game the sprites are  very 
nicely detailed and coloured.The scrolling is nice and smooth and 
€is  without  ficker.The  sound  on  the  other  hand  is  a   bit 
of  a  let  down  and  the  game  is  without  any  really   good 
sound.Otherwise  Black-Tiger  is  a  very  good  game  with  good 
playabilty and value for money.
