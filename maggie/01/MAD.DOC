                                by Sammy Joe of TLB

MAD  Vision just send me their two intro/demo compilation  disks. 
As you do not really know what to say about them I will bore  you 
with something that happened to me just now!
 
As  you probably know,  the Lost Boys are running their own  disk 
magazine. So this disk magazine should contain a section called:

          ST CHARTS BY NEXT

Do you know who they are ?  For the ones who do not know who they 
are,  they  are  a French team from Marseille.  They  send  us  a 
letter  some  time back asking whether they could  put  their  ST 
Charts in the Disk Magazine.  I agreed because I think that  they 
are  really good.  2 Weeks ago ZAE from Next phoned me and  asked 
whether I could wait with my first issue until they have finished 
their second ST Charts,  they said that they are going to send it 
to me as soon as they have finished it. 

As the disk magazine is basically finished now, I am just waiting 
for their ST Charts as I do want to release the demo on the Atari 
Show in June (1st of June).

In  order to get ZAE to hurry up with his stuff I just  tried  to 
phone him in Marseille.  What a disaster!!  Well, it wasn't realy 
that bad, just that I had to speak in French because that guy who 
answered  the phone did not speak any English (that's a  logic!). 
After I finally found out that ZAE wasn't there and that he would 
not come before 8 o' clock.  What I did was, I begged the guy  on 
the phone to ask ZAE to phone me back as soon as possible.  Let's 
see what happens.  The only problem is that Manikin is down  here 
in London at the moment and the Lost Boys are having a meeting in 
the pub tonight !

Here's some more gerneral information: 

-  this spell checker does not know the following words:
   PUB, FUCK, SHIT, PISS, CRAP, BUM, WANKER, SHITHEAD,....
-  yesterday I got my physics exam back and I had 2 out  of  15 
   points
-  today  i got my chemistry exam back and I have 5  out  of  15 
   points
-  I  also  got a "BLAUER BRIEF" this morning  from  the  German 
   school that tells me, that I have failed French!!!!

     
I  reckon that that is about all the useless information for  one 
day.

So  what can I say about the Compilations ?  Personally I  reckon 
that  the compilations are very good.  It all begins with a  nice 
intro (I can't quite remember what it was because i looked at  it 
only briefly but I'll try to remember most of it BUT do not blame 
me if I get it wrong!).  One thing that I can definitely remember 
about it was that there was a nice scroller and a piece of musix. 
I  assume that the scroller is in the bottom border (I hope  that 
it is right what I am saying).  I think that there was a  wobbler 
at  the top of the screen.  The thing that takes up most  of  the 
space on the screen is the magnificent screen selector.  What you 
get  is  some text telling you about the screens you  can  access 
with a letter or a number in front of it. 

As  I  have just checked there are 26 programs on  the  disk.  It 
appears that the intros are by people like:  DMA, MAD MAX (he has 
never  written  an  intro (it seems to me that that  is  a  musix 
file)), BMT, Delight, Fal, FP, FOF, FUZ, Hotline, TCB, TDA.

Mad  Visions 1st intro compilation disk contains an intro by  TEX 
that  I have never ever come across in my 16 (nearly  17  years).   
By  the  looks,  they have to be pretty old or  they  were  never 
finished, but it might be, that I am just a tick behind.

So, all in all, as I am getting rather bored with this article, I 
will  wrap  now and get some lovely food of  my  mum.  Rap,  Rap, 
Rapediedap, Rap, Rap, Rapediedapdap......
