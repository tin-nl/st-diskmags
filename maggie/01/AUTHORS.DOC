either  Saturdays or Fridays.  If he does not go to the  pub,  he

2. Sammy Joe

Blond long hair,  he is not growing a beard,  also wears black T-
shirts, has some ripped trousers (but his mum wants to throw them 
away), also likes to go to the pub, likes getting totally pissed, 
especially on Snake Bite Black (half a pint of beer,  half a pint 
of Lager and some Ribena),  he has no girl friend,  he listens to 
any    kind    of    musix    (especially    Heavy     Metal/Doom 
Metal/Speed/Death/Cult Metal,  punk rock and Hardcore, he is also 
going to the GWAR concert.

 
3. Manikin

Manikin  is  the last one of the Lost Boys members,  he  has  not 
actually written an article for this magazine.  The reason why  I 
am  saying this is,  because the article,  he has written is  the 
TWIST  article which was already published in ST NEWS  some  time 
back. I have taken this article and included it again (I hope you 
do  not mind Rich the Karsmakers).  Manikin has short grey  hair, 
only listen to pop (New Order and Midnight Oil). Manikin has 
finally managed to write a new article for this issue(Copyright)!


4. Ben

Ben is Sammy Joe's neighbour,  he likes dressing  casual,  noting 
special about his looks,  he has short hair, likes playing games, 
writes all (most of) the game reviews,  is a great guy,  does not 
drink (yet),  does not smoke, has no girl friend, he is not going 
to go to the GWAR gig.


5. MUG UK

or  bunny  arse as he is called (god knows  why).   This  guy  is 
supposed to send me articles, which have not arrived yet. If they 
have not arrived within the next two or three days,  they'll have 
to  go in the next issue.  Mug also has long hair,  codes in  GFA 
Basic,  lives in Wales along with some sheep (they are great  for 
having sex or what do you think MUG?), listens of Def Leppard and 
other soft Metal, works in a night club.  (in 2 days the mag will 
be released but I still have not received anu articles yet!!!!!).


6. Oliver

Well,  this guy is our foreign journalist, he lives in Geneva, he 
has done only one article in this issue but he promised me to  do 
more  in  future,  he only listens  to  speed/thrash  metal,  his 
nickname is ALC (abbreviation for Alcohol,  yes,  you've gathered 
it,  he also likes to get pissed on Cider,  beer, Martini and all 
the rest). 


7. HARVEY LODDER

What a weirdo (as David says), blond short hair, codes sample de-
mos, writes the odd game, likes some heavy metal, I can't be 
bothered to say much more, it's not because that I do not like
him but I must finish the program!!!!!


8. YOU

Whoever you are,  or even better,  whatever you are, you are very 
very welcome to write an article for this disk magazine. In fact, 
we even want you to.  This disk magazine will not be able to stay 
alive without your help,  there might not even be a second  Issue 
if you won't write to us!!!
