And  a great vision did appear before Moses as a ball  of  yellow 
flame.  And admist the flame stood a wooden hat-stand, and lo the 
hat-stand did not burn.  And from the burning hat-stand there did 
come a low and resonant voice.

"Here me Moses" saideth the voice. "I am Thy Lord God... so watch 
it."

And  Moses  did fall to his knees and did sayeth,  "If  thou  art 
truly Our Lord God why comest thou before me as a hat-stand?"

And the flames did grow brighter, and the low, resonant voice did 
sayeth "Never mind that now,  thou clever-trousers.  I am here to 
warn thee of a darkness which shall descend upon the lands of Man 
if thou dost not playeth thy cards right. And this darkness shall 
be called the greenhouse effect."

And Moses didst reply, "What is a greenhouse, O Lord?"

"It's a type of glass shed,  but that is not important right now" 
replied Our Lord God.  "Now listen,  this darkness of which I was 
speaking  before  I was so rudely interrupted  shall  be  brought 
about by the destruction of the holy ozone layer which I,  in  my 
infinite  wisdom,  created to protect the lands of Man  from  the 
heavens - and it dost take bloody ages 'n all."

But Moses didst become puzzled,  and didst say "What is an ozone, 
O Lord?"

And Our Lord God didst say,  "If thou didst not walk around  with 
thy  head up thine arse thou wouldst know.  Now shutteth  up  and 
listen.  Thou  shalt not invent the horseless carriage,  nor  any 
other smog-producing contraction,  lest thou dost cloggeth up  my 
nice  cleanatmosphere  and lo causeth me to cough  up  my  divine 
ring. Squirteth thee not thy aerosols, for this also does pisseth 
me off.  Had I wanted thee to useth such things,  I would not, in 
my infinite wisdom, have given thee sweaty armpits."

"This also goes for thy fly killing substances. I didst not spend 
ages  making the fiddly bloody things for thou to  shooteth  them 
down every five minutes. If thou continuest to disobey this law I 
shall  send forth a plague of them upon you,  and they  shall  be 
fifty feet long,  and shall carry with them a ten feet rolled  up 
newspaper with which to smite thee. And yea shall it sting!"

And Moses didst look upon the holy hat-stand and didst say,  "Can 
not we have a new one, O Lord?"

"What?" exclaimed our Lord God.

And Moses did elaborate thus.  "Well, when this ozone layer wears 
out, couldst thou not just maketh another?"

"No!" exclaimed Our Lord God. "I wouldeth not."

"Why not?" demanded Moses.

"Because there's none left, that's why" replied Lord God.

"Well make some more then" said Moses.

And  Our Lord God didst answer in all his wrath,  "Speaketh  thee 
not to me in that tone of voice thou obnoxious little oik. Asketh 
not thy stupid questions and just taketh my holy words to all the 
people of the world!"

And the sacred flames didst die out,  leaving the holy  hat-stand 
untouched.  And Moses didst bow his head solemnly and then  didst 
run like fuck.
