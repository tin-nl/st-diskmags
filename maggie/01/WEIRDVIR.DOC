                          or a PAIN IN THE ARSE 
                                by Sammy Joe

Again,  as usual,  I have millions of letters to answer.  Most of 
them  want the updated PD List.  As I have just received quite  a 
few more demos I have decided to update my PD list. 

Hang on,  my neighbour,  who is writing the game reviews, is just 
coming into my room. "What d'ya you want ?" I ask him. He replies 
that he has a few problems with his 1st Word plus disk.

Currently  I  am going into my dad's room where  his  ST  stands. 
Now I quickly loading it,  a message comes up:  Data on disk A is 
defect.  After  hitting  the  Return key a  few  times  the  disk 
continues  to  load.  After we have loaded  his  document  called 
OLDIES,  I  have started to edit it and the computer began to  do 
some  really  weird things.  At that moment I   though  that  the 
program  crashed again.  Just in case, I got out my virus  killer 
and began to kill. The virus killer's diagnostic is: GHOST virus.   

After  having  killed this so called Ghost virus on all  my  dads 
disks I continued to edit the PD list.....

After  having typed for about half an hour it was time  again  to 
hit the Return key.  Surprise,  surprise....  After I pressed the 
Return  key,  the cursor began to move around on the  screen.  At 
first  I  thought that one of the keys is stuck,  but  after  the 
cursor moved up two pages,  it started typing things on its  own. 
Strange  eeh?  Whatever  the  computer  typed  even  made  sense. 
Sometimes  the computer made a spelling mistake but corrected  it 
instantly. 

After  having watched that for a few minutes I realized that  the 
virus  stored everything I typed and was now copying various  bit 
and bobs on the screen wherever he felt like it. 

Be warned, when the virus has activated itself, your work is lost 
as  the  virus does not allow any more  keyboard  accesses.  That 
means, the mouse is of no use either.

What should I have learned from this:

- do not leave your disks unprotected
- do not copy too many disks
- always save your work in between
- use the virus killer more often
- ......

                              That's about it, 
                                   I am off to the pub now to get
                                   pissed  out of my brains as  I 
                                   failed    my   physics    exam 
                                   today......

                         YOUUUURSSS  SSAMMI joooue
