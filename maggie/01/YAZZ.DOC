                             by Sammy Joe of TLB

I  was asked to review this sample demo by a few friends of  mine 
from Germany. As there is nothing much to say about sample demos, 
this review is not going to be very long. 

As  you have probably gathered already,  the sample is of  Yazz's 
number  one  hit The Only way is Up.  Right at the  beginning  it 
loads  up  a  nice  hand drawn picture  of  two  woman.  It  then 
continues to load,  load and load even more !!  As soon as it has 
finished loading,  the sample begins. The sample quality is a lot 
better  in comparison with the Aerosmith sample.  Im  fact,  this 
sample is very very good.  But then again,  it is not as good  as 
our samples are. The sample goes on for quite some time....

Here  are  some facts:  The program is in  the  autofolder  (yes, 
that's why it loads straight away). The picture is on the disk in 
the  ART  Director  format and its  length  is  32512.  The  disk 
contains two sample files, the length of the bigger one is 614K. 

In  other words,  this demo will definitely not run on a  machine 
with only 1/2 Megabyte of memory.  At this point I might as  well 
tell  you that Spaz has only got a half meg.  But I still  advise 
you to upgrade your ST,  you do not know what you are missing out 
on!!!

Currently I have written 2 screen pages and there is nothing else 
for me to say.
