
              ON THE LOOKOUT
                         by Sammy Joe of TLB               

This  section here deals with demos which have not been  released 
yet.  I  will always try to tell you as much as possible  on  the 
demos. Let's get started.


THE NEW CAREBEARS DEMO ( I don't know the name yet)

When the Carebears finished their Cuddly Demos,  they  said:  "No 
more  demos".  It  doesn't look like they are going to  stick  to 
that.  When Manikin went to Germany to visit Thalion, Nick of TCB 
already  had a few new screens written for their new demo.  I  do 
not  know  what the screens are,  but apparently  they  beat  the 
living  daylights  out of the Mindbomb demo (I  personally  can't 
believe that the screens are that good, I'll believe Manikin when 
I have seen the screens myself). 
Anyway, this demo is definitely one to look out for.


THE PHALEON DEMO (put together by some geezer from Marseille)

This is the first demo organized by the frogs (don't take it  too 
personal).  This  demo will not just feature screens by the 
Replicants,there  will also be screens by Chuck the Fox,Lost Boys
and  TCB,  not to forget to mention that the main menu is by  the 
Replicants and that  they also do the protection.  The demo  will 
come on 2 disks. By the looks of it,  it appears to be  a  second 
Union Demo but a lot better!!!!!!!!!!


THE OVERLANDERS EUROPEAN DEMO

This is another demo in which crews from all over the world  take 
part.  We have told the Overlanders that we might also be doing a 
screen  for their demo,  which at the moment is very unlikely  as 
Manikin  is having a break (he also has to work for  his  exams). 
BUT we still might be doing a demo.


THE INNER CIRCLE DEMO

The  Inner Circle are a bunch of English guys who formed a  group 
lately,  they consist of Dynamic Duo, Fingerbobs, ST Squad, Griff 
of the Resistance,  Electronic Images, I think that these are all 
the members,  but do not blame me if I missed anyone).  This demo 
will  not  be as good as The Mindbomb Demo or the  new  Carebears 
Demo,  but it is definitely another one to look out for.  I  have 
seen  a screen for this demo produced by the Fingerbobs and  this 
screen is very good.  I have just seen some more screens for this 
demo, they consist of quartet tunes, some nice sprites and loadsa 
other good stuff.


THE ALLIANCE DEMO II  (from France)

This  is  another  demo  produced,   this  time  mainly  by   the 
Overlanders.  Quoting Stan Mercury,  "Our demo looks pretty  damn 
good  already." It seems that there is nothing else to say  about 
this demo.

 
CONSTELLATION DEMO III

The  only thing I know about this demo is that it is their  third 
demo and that it is due to be released in Summer.


THE TEC DEMO

The code for this demo was produced by TEC of V8. 
This  demo has been released by now,  you can read the review  io 
the PD section.


ST CONNEXION'S DREAM DEMO

This demo is due in July.


SEWER SOFTS SOUND TRACKER

A  sound tracker written by Sewer Soft from  Australia,  I  don't 
know if it is PD or what, no idea!!!


That's about it with the demos due to be released.  If I'll  find 
out about any more demos, I'll notify you. 


P.S.:    Skunk is probably coding another Sample demo right now.
P.P.S.:  Oh damn, I just about forgot that it is very likely that 
         the  Overlanders  are producing another  one  of  their 
         Menus. Keep up the good work guys, great menus.
