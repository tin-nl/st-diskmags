     The idea for Mind bomb originated soon after the release of 
the Definitive demo in April 1989. A few screens began to get 
written and shown to various people including Stefan Posthuma and 
Richard Karsmakers of ST news. At this point we asked Stefan to 
also write a screen and he said that he would. It was duly 
announced in ST news that the Lost Boys would be producing a new 
demo called the Mind Bomb to be released soon (a slight over 
estimate!)      By the time that the PC show came around at the 
end of September we had already written about 4 complete screens 
and happily announced to all and sundry that the Mind Bomb demo 
would be released very soon. Stefan meanwhile presented us with a 
screen and promised that he would in fact be writning another one 
as well. At the show various other people asked if they could 
write screens, these include the Bad Brew Crew who indeed did 
eventually write a screen for us. A young german coder called 
Chuck from a previously unheard of crew called Foxx also asked if 
he could write a screen and that he did!

     Mean while it was time for me to go off to university. A 
very battered 520stfm accompanied me to Manchester and on this 
tired and worn out machine about 4 more screens were produced 
before the Christmas break. At this point Mindbomb almost got 
released with about 9 screens on it. But unfortunately I took 
rather a long time over coding a main menu and so by the time 
that Christmas and New year had come and gone and I had returned 
to Manchester the demo was still not complete.

     At about this time Stefan invited me to go to Holland at 
easter time, from where we would go on a visit to Thalion 
software where TEX, TNT, and Nick of the CAREBEARS work. I 
decided that this was a very suitable place for me to complete 
the Mind bomb demo. Work continued and more screen came into 
being. By the time that I left for Holland I had coded a grand 
total of 15 screens towards the demo. I had also collected the 
screens from BBC and FOXX. On arriving in Holland Stefan 
presented me with 2 more screens on top of the 2 that he had 
already written. 

     Then just to make matters even worse, Aenigmatica asked if 
we would have space for a couple of ther screens. Alas this 
proved to be impossible and so these screens (they were in fact 
rather good!) had to be left by the wayside. 

     And so it came to pass that the demo was finished (almost) 
at Thalion in Germany. Nick of the Carebears helped out with a 
little protection and some small tricks that I hadn't thought of 
and Stefan and I together put the final touches to what really 
turned out to be The Lost Boys and friends Mind Bomb Demo.

     Thus thanks must be given to the team who helped to produce 
what I belive to be the best demo in the history of the Atari St
They go to :-  DIGITAL INSANITY, FOXX (Chuck and Tangens), BBC 
(Andy the Arfling, The Pilot and Chrispy Noodle), MAD MAX ( for 
unwittling producing all the music!!! thanks guy what would we 
all do without you!!), NICK of TCB (for the protection!) and of 
course to SAMMY JOE and SPAZ the other Lost Boys whose help was 
of course utterly invaluable and often over critical (Dave!).

     Now a few words about Mind Bomb and its status in the world.
First MIND BOMB is NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN  it has been licensed by us 
to Budgie UK and thus must be treated like a piece of software.
Anybosy who uploads it to a bulletin board, splits it up into 
single files to distribute or sells it in a PD Library without 
prior consent from either Budgie UK or us is liable to 
PROSECUTION by Budgie. 

     The Lost Boys are sorry if you feel that we are being mean 
by doing it this way but have worked extremely hard on this 
production and we felt that it was only fair that we made some 
money from it if at all possible. PD libraries have in the past 
constantly sold our products and made a very healthy profit upon 
them without us ever seeing a penny from it. We felt that this 
was very unfair and in the past we have appealed individually to 
the Libraries themselves to pay us a proportion of their profits,
many of these libraries, among them ( Page 6, 16/32 bit, 
Riverdene, South West pd and others), were more than happy to 
oblige us others were decidedly unhappy to be asked, these 
include most notably Softville PD who we know sold a very 
substancial number of copies of our DEF demo in its early days 
but refused to give us even a penny. The solution to our problems 
came in the shape of Budgie UK who offered to market our demo 
through the PD libraries. This seems to have been very successful 
so far and the Budgie team have been most obliging and very 
professional at what they do.

     Quite interestingly, since the release of Mind Bomb through 
the Budgie UK network, softville pd have announced that they will 
not be selling our Mind Bomb demo in their PD library because 
they do no think that 1. it is good enough and 2. that it is 
worth the money.    We find this attidude extremely amusing, if 
ever you begin to think that the Lost Boys treat the demo and PD 
market with to money grabbing an attitude then go and check out 
Softville PD, they arte the stingiest bunch of wankers you ever 
likely to see!!!!!

     For those of you who may be interested there will in fact be 
another, quite small, Lost Boys demo released around the end of 
June or the beginning of July. It will only have about 3 or 4 
screens. But they will be of a very good quality and we are sure 
that you will like them. This will again be released through 
Budgie UK.                                    
                         All the best
