EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

Yes,  I know,  this game is quite old, but have you ever finished 
it  ?  For some special effects do the following:  hold down  the 
HELP key and type XIMARGOTKEV. 


ROADBLASTERS

When your car is on the starting line type LAVILLASTRANGIATO. Now 
you can press the following keys to achieve various things:
X - spin the car             S - go to the next stage
F - refill tank              G - quit game
0 - remove special weapons   1 - U2 cannon
2 - cruise missile           3 - electro shields
4 - nitro injectors 


BLOOD MONEY

To cheat,  just press the HELP key. If you press 1 on the key pad
you  can get lodsa moneeeeyyy.  If you press 4 you get to get  to 
the shop and you can buy lodsa weapons.  You will no longer loose 
your weapons when you loose a life.


CYBERNOID

Haven't got enough lives ? No problem, just type RAISTLIN in when 
the picture comes up and you'll definitely have enough lives.   


ROBOCOP

Pause  the game,  hold the shift key pressed and  type  in:  ALEX 
MURPHY.  From  now on you can regain your energy by holding  down 
the left mouse button.  Another way,  in fact a much simpler  way 
is:  Pause the game and type in BEST KEPT SECRET. Now restart the 
game.

 
R-TYPE

Do  not insert the second disk when promted,  BUT press Help  and 
type  in  ME and press the arrow pointing  up.  Now  insert  your 
second disk again and hit the space bar as hard as you  can.  You 
now have the following cheats available:
F5 - Invulnerability from aliens and walls
F6 - Invulnerability from alien fire
F7 - Infinite credits
F8 - Control of the orb using the mouse
Well, it should not be too hard for you to finish this game.

IKARI WARRIORS

Great game this,  I used to play it for hours and hours.  When  I 
finally finished it without using he cheat code, a friend of mine 
found  it  out.  Just  get on the high score table  and  type  in 
FREERIDE. You now have enough lives to finish the game easily.


DOUBLE DRAGON

When  the  game has finished loading and you are asked  to  press 
either 1 or 2,  press both of them along with the ESC  key.  Keep 
pressing the ESC key until the credits display goes wrong.


MICKEY MOUSE

completed the tower.

do.
