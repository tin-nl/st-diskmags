This  is a great game,  I just love the animation of that  little 
guy doing the back flips and all the other stuff. 

What I have got here for you are not really cheats. They are more 
like some additional information.  The first one is,  if you type 
in  JO on the screen where that little guy jumps about the  musix 
changes.  By  the way,  JO is an abbreviation for Jochen  Hippel. 
That's the guy's name.

The  following two cheats can be used on any Thalion  intro,  you 
know  the one I mean,  the one where the water drops  down,  then 
some  great  musix and finally a bouncing Thalion  sign  appears. 
You'll probably have noticed by now, that the sign stops bouncing 
after  some time,  if you type in SCHNISM,  the sign  will  start 
bouncing up and down. 

I like this intro so much so that I can just look at it for hours 
(a bit of exaggeration here). But after a while the musix becomes 
boring so I just type in AAARRGH and I get a second tune.    

I do not know any real cheats, so I'll leave you with that then
