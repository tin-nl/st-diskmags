Remember this old classic from US GOLD.  Well,  if by any  chance 
you've  had any none to serious problems like getting  killed  in 
the first minute of the game or just being really pissed off  and 
scared  to  death by all those mean  monsters,  here  comes  your 
saviour in the form of MAULWURFS'S CHEAT SERVICE. 

I  can't really believe that you didn't manage to complete  Level 
1,  so  I'll just skip that .....  Oh no,  there is some  serious 
complaining  being  done  by the mob destroying  my  front  door. 
What's   that,   they're  shouting  ...   "Give  us   the   first 
level".Jesus,  I've  heard that news travels fast,  but  this  is 
bullshit.

All   right.   By  popular  demand  here  is  the   First   Level 
(boring)!I'll  try putting the hints into an chronological  order 
as not to confuse you...(That's really clever of you, Oliver. The 
Editor).
Right ...

Level 1:

- In the game you will discover  several treasure boxes  (as  you   
  well know), but not all of these will give you a reward. If you 
  like living a perverted life, well by all means touch the first     
  box as you will  be turned into a duck.  As this game  has  not 
  been   copyrighted by Walt Disney, it will almost certainly not 
  be   Donald,  but wait and see for yourself.  A Duck freak will  
  have   his/hers  (no chauvinism here)  fun  anyway.  Well,  the 
  second box you will sooner or later discover you (guess what ?) 
  touch  it  and  you will be  rewarded  (nice  touch  that).  Do 
  yourself a favour and keep away from the vultures.  You  should 
  keep running, as not to get caught by them.
  When  you have passed through the guillotine,  run  across  the 
  bridge.  Again you should,  for the sake of our hero avoid  the 
  bats  and  shoot them where they expect it  the  least,  namely 
  right up their ....(stop right here or you are fired this  very 
  moment.   The  Editor).   Well,   I'll  leave  it  up  to  your 
  imagination. And it certainly isn't what the ed. thought. Close 
  shave  there.  Well  ,  if  you managed it this  far  you  will 
  probably/hopefully manage it to the end of this Level.  I  will 
  quickly.   Run  onto  the  metal  platform  and  when  the  the 
  explosions  are out of sight,  run to the next ladder to  avoid 
  another  mean monster.  It looks a bit like Spaz of the  TLB  I 
  suppose,  but its probably meant to be a pig on two legs. After 
  having  successfully evaded the P.I.G ...pig man you will  have 
  to start killing the men that enter the screen.  I hope I  made 
  some sense and you make exactly the same out of it.

Level 2:

- Well,  all  those people out there.  What are you  still  doing 
  here. Hoping for important clues you know you'll never get. All 
  these mad persons, will you please stop reading now. 
  Right, after having persuaded all those who want to cheat, I am 
  left   with  those  nice  people  that  only  want  some   easy 
  conversation. Here comes : 
  killtortoisesanddon't getcaughtbythemeanb.....dshells. Jumponto
  thebridge,  thenjumptwiceontothesecondbridge. Here's a good one 
  I only found out about after having been killed  god-knows-how-
  many times :  if you fall of the bridge keep jumpin'  forwards. 
  By  the way   that  little stunt (adolescent  behaviour.ed.)  I 
  pulled  there was   meant to disturb all those  who  are  still 
  interested in just   quickly reading all the tips (why I run  a 
  CHEAT SERVICE I don't   know : I suppose it's for all the fun I 
  get from slaving hour   after precious hour on this  keyboard). 
  Out  of desperation I'll   start finishing my Chocolate  Easter 
  Egg with a walloping amount of calories........................
  One  Easter Egg later ...  Avoid the fire-balls and  kill  both 
  white and red birds.  Then with all the audacity you can muster 
  kill the snakes (don't get into trouble with the RSPCA, the WWF 
  or the IRA (?)) and touch the box to be rewarded.  Now comes  a 
  big bugger of a monster.  Fire at it repeatedly to slay(er) it. 
  That unfortunately (for you,  not the monster) doesn't  happen, 
  but if you stand still,  it should jump over you. And there you 
  have Level 2 (not 42).

Level 3:
  
  The following two levels will be a lot shorter than the ones 
  already  done by Maulwurf because now I (Sammy Joe)  am  typing 
  and  I  do not really know/like this  game.  Maulwurf  did  not 
  finish reviewing this game because he had to go back to Geneva.
  Watch  out,   the  floor  is  moving,  ahhhhhhhhhh,  damn.  You 
  definitely should not get caught there.  You should be able  to 
  see some knights hanging from the top,  yeah, blow the hell out 
  of them, exterminate them. Move quickly between the 2 platforms 
  and kill the second knight. The next thing you do is wait, naa, 
  not here. You must first climb on the steps and then wait until 
  a tongue comes from the right.  Jump on it,  watch out that you 
  do  not fall off,  it is very slibbery (I do not want  to  know 
  where the tongue was 5 minutes ago??).  Now drop down onto  the 
  blue  platform and watch out that you are not hit  by  anything 
  flying. Get onto the tongue again and get off it when you reach 
  the grass.  When you are finally there,  shoot the cloud in the 
  eye, get the key and you are on to the next level.

Level 4:

  What  do you do when you see a ladder ?  You climb it.  But  in 
  this case you don't!!! Slide down the slimy section, then shoot 
  the  hand and the monster.  When you have finally  reached  the 
  end of the slime,  you should be on something that looks like a 
  dead head of a flower.  Important:  Do not stay on the lift for 
  too  long  or you will be killed!(But if you  are  killed,  you 
  cares?).  Kill the caterpillars and  the blue and yellow blobs. 
  Now you should be in level 5.

Level 5:

  Kill, kill and kill again. Shoot the birds, crawl up the ladder 
  and  jump  the gap.  Rise up the platform and the  ladders  and 
  allow your man to fall into the gap in front of you.  Kill  the 
  man above you. Watch out that the firing heads do not get you!! 
  Stay out of the range of the last man.  Shoot the fly until  it 
  disintegrates.  The  last  thing you have to do in  this  great 
  game  is:  Get between the devils legs so that he cannot  shoot 
  you. The only thing you have to do now is: Shooooooooooot hiim.
