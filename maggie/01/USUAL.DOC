                              by Sammy Joe 

This  disk  magazine has been put together within 1  and  a  half 
months,  it contains demo/game/utility reviews,  different  tunes 
and many more articles on various other subjects. 

I  have personally devoted all my spare time to this magazine  in 
order to make it very good, maybe even the best !?! 

BUT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPEND THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS I  DID 
ON  THIS ISSUE ON THE FORTHCOMING ISSUES.  So ,what I ask of  you 
reading this here is,  get down to work and write an article  for 
this disk magazine. I want this disk magazine to be very good and 
this  is only possible if everybody does his  bit.  Currently  we 
have "journalists" from London, Scottland, Wales, FRANCE and some 
other places. 

WE  ARE  LOOKING  FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER  THE  WORLD  TO  WRITE 
ARTICLES  FOR THIS MAGAZINE,  AS YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY  NOTICED, 
THIS  DISK MAG IS CALLED TLB & !!!  FRIENDS !!!  That FRIENDS  is 
you.  It  might  even  be that you will become  famous  for  your 
interesting, boring, weird articles. 

IF  I  WILL  NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH ARTICLES TO GO  INTO  THE  SECOND 
ISSUE,  IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE A  SECOND 
ONE  !!!!  So if you like this magazine and you would like it  to 
continue SEND US YOUR IDEAS,  SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE IT, ARTICLES 
and whatever you think we should know. What you could also do is, 
send  us a letter for our readers' corner.  If you know  anything 
that  you think other ST Users might find useful,  send it to  us 
and we will use it and credit you!!!!  So basically what we  want 
is, is your help !!! Things we are especially interested in are:

               - Hints & tips
               - Solutions to any adventure
               - Things you know and other ST users  might  find 
                 useful
               - Reviews in general (software & hardware)
               - Your artwork for the best picture
               - Jokes
               - Reviews of Shows
               - Your ideas
               - and many many more things.

I hope that you have got the idea,  if you want to you could even 
write  an  article on "The best bonking positions" or on  a  very 
good gig that you went to.  

If  you do write an article,  please send it to us on disk in  an 
ASCII file format. Thanks a lot in advance to everybody out there 
who is willing to help me with this magazine !!!!
