So, this article is.... Hang on, I can't write an article without 
musix.  What shall I listen to ?  Hmmmmmmmm,  my Jason Donovan  & 
Kylie Minogue compilation, noooooo, too slow. Hmmmmmmmm,.....BROS
Now,  insert the tape in my stereo, turn up the volume, 1,2,3 and 
here we go......,  everybody sing along:  When will I,  will I be 
famous   ???   (No   idea)   I   can   answer,   I   can   answer 
that...jkldfghustgihioasrhiadfhisfghug........... Silence........
...Damn.........It  seems  as if my stereo does  not  like  BROS, 
yeah,   I  have  got  a  good  idea,   why  don't  we  play  some 
OVERKILL................

Finally I have some decent musix to listen to.

Once  upon a time,  there was a programmer called Camy  Maertens. 
He likes programming Public Domain games,  who doesn't? But then, 
he  got annoyed with all the PD libraries selling his  games  for 
œ3.  He  found out that the PD libraries made a profit  of  œ2.40 
with each disk they sold.  So Camy thought:  They make money with 
the  game I programmed,  with the game I spend all my spare  time 
on.  So he founded a company called BUDGIE UK. He was soon joined 
by another lonely programmer.   They began to copyright the games 
and  then  send  them to the PD libraries who  agreed  to  pay  a 
certain amount of money to Budgie UK. 

Soon after that, other programmers started to send their games to 
Budgie UK and Budgie began to grow.  Not the actual company,  but 
their  copyrighted games!!!  

Budgie receives a check every three months from the PD  libraries 
who  are  registered with them and the money is  then  split  up. 
Every programmer gets a certain percentage.  If he has done three 
games, he gets more than somebody who has only done one game. 

Oh,  I just about forgot,  only PD libraries registered to Budgie 
are allowed to sell the gear.

Nowadays,   Budgie  are  not  just  doing  games,  they  also  do 
utilities and demos.

As you probably know,  we (The Lost Boys) have given our Mindbomb 
Demo to Budgie and we are glad that we did it.  So I advise  you, 
if  you want to make some money for you to go to  the  pub,  send 
your game,  demo or utility to Budgie.  Budgie is THE FAIRER SIDE 
OF PUBLIC DOMAIN.

Budgie's  games are not particularly good when you  compare  them 
with games you buy in shops,  but then again, you must think that 
they only cost œ3.  And for œ3 most of them are definitely  worth 
it. 

Oh,  something else i reckon you should know about Budgie UK  is, 
that  they  make no profit for themselves AT  ALL.  The  guys  at 
Budgie are really great guys!!!!
    
Let's see if there is anything else which is worth knowing  about 
Budgie  UK.  They also have distributors  in  Australia,  Canada, 
Scandinavia  and  France.   This  way  you  product  will  spread 
everywhere.  

I  think  that that covers just about all that is  worth  knowing 
about Budgie UK, if you want any further details, write to:
