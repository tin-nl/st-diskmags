                              by Michael Schuessler (Sammy Joe)

Here  it is at long last,  the XTC demo by the  Alliance.  To  my 
surprise I got two copies of it the same day.

As  soon as you switch your computer on,  some text comes on  the 
screen  saying XTC.  After a bit more loading,  the first  screen 
comes   up   on   the   screen.    Very   very   impressive,   no 
left/right/bottom  borders  along  with some colour  bars  and  a 
nice  sample.  The only thing I would say to that is,  very  very 
nice !!!!!  The graphix for their Alliance logo is also very well 
drawn.

Something  that I very much like about this demo are the  screens 
that  come up when it is loading and  depacking  something.  Nice 
idea guys.  Well,  what happens is,  when something is loading  a 
nice picture of a disk drive comes up,  some disks as sprites are 
bouncing up and down along with a sample.  Depending on how  much 
there is to load,  the disks are crossed out. When it is finished 
loading,  the  disk  drive  fades  out and  some  chip  fades  in 
indicating  that  the computer is depacking or  working  out  the 
screen. 

Finally  the main menu comes up,  wow,  a very nice picture of  a 
dragon and some forest.  There is a scroller at the bottom or the 
top, I can't quite remember right now. From the main menu you can 
select 14 different screens by using the arrow keys.  Screens  in 
this demo are by BMT, TPP, ACF, TRT and of course Newline.

Starting at the top of the list there is the first screen by BMT. 
This screen is very nice from the visual side.  There are sprites 
spinning  around a bar.  They get smaller the further  they  move 
away  from you.  At the bottom of the screen there is a  scroller 
going across the left/right and of course the bottom border. 
All in all this is a very nice screen!!!!

Now  going on to the second screen by BMT I am confronted with  a 
big sprite, some volume indicators and a starfield.    The   star 
field is in the middle of the screen,  the sprites are on top  of 
the  star  field,  the  big wobbly sprite is at the  top  of  the 
screen and the volume indicator is a colour bar.

BMT's  third  screen:   This  is  another  very  good  screen,  I 
especially  like  the sprites.  The sprites shrink and  grow  and 
spin around in a circle at the same time.  There is a scroller at 
the top,  a more channel sample player(sounds like it),  although 
the sample quality is not too good.

TPP's  first  screen consists of a big  wobbling  sprite,  colour 
bars, a bouncing scroller. This screen is pretty good.

The  second screen by TPP is all right.  This screen only  has  a 
spinning  digitized  picture  of one of the crew  members  and  a 
scrolline going into the distance.  This scroller looks very very 
nice. This screen is actually quite good.


TPP's third screen is one of my favourite screens in this demo, I 
really  like  the wobbly,  dotty scroller along  with  the  great 
sprites.  The scroller and the sprites have a nice shadow.  Looks 
good.

ACF  (Alien  Cracking Formation)'s first screen in this  demo  is 
utter shit, it only has a bouncing scroller and some colour bars. 
I  really  think that this one is the worst screen in  the  demo. 
Sorry guys.

Their next screen is better,  it has quite a few pieces of  musix 
hacked  from  various games along with a nice  scroller,  a  star 
field and a wobbling logo.

The next screen is by TRT.  Again,  this screen belongs to one of 
my  favourite screens,  as there is quite a bit happening on  the 
screen.  There  are  two  scrollers  horizontally,  one  scroller 
vertically,  bottom border,  some colour bars, some letters (TRT) 
spin about and some sprites saying Alliance move about too.

TRT's  second screen is again not too good.  It only  contains  a 
bouncing scroller and some big sprite wobbling.

Now,  finally  here's the first screen by Newline:  colour  bars, 
volume indicators,  a moving background and a pretty big  crystal 
scroller.  This screen might not sound very good,  but it is very 
nice.

Newline's second screen consists of another star field,  2 pretty 
big  sprites,  many  many small scrollers and  some  text  saying 
Alliance bounces around. Personally I really like this screen!!!!

The  third screen by Newline features a sin-scroller,  some  text 
spinning around a bar,  the usual scroller,  a moving  background 
and a bouncing Alliance logo.

And  the  last screen in this demo is a so called  space  filler. 
This  so called space filler is by Newline again.  It only has  a 
nice picture, a scroller, a sample and some sprites.

Now finally there is of course the Reset demo. This is nor really 
a demo,  it is merely a joke.  What comes up is some text  saying 
"Software Failure    Guru Meditating #$678o5ti68968    "

So,  that's about it with the demo,  here is what  think about it 
in a quick summary.
