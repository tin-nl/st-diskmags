
Well done,  you have managed to get into the hidden screen.  This 
screen is not a real article, it just contains various lyrics and 
more funny information!  The first lyrics are from the Spermbirds 
and   the  others  are  from  Kreator  from  the  album   Extreme 
Aggression. 
 
                         SPERMBIRDS
                                  by Sammy Joe

So who has not heard of this great German hardcore band ?  As far 
as  I know only a few Germans know about them,  I really  do  not 
understand why they are very very good.  Their albums are  pretty 
short BUT there lyrics are just great. Here is a small example:

Do you know what a bitch is ?

No ? Well here's what the Spermbirds think:

A bitch will look you in the eye
And lie right to your face
A bitch'll take your feelings
And spread'em all over the place
A bitch will try to own you
If you're dumb enough to let her
But you're a grown man now
And by god you gotta know better

What a Bitch is !!!!!

Not  bad  eeh?  I do not really feel like copying out  the  whole 
song because I have just found one with even better lyrics.
I reckon that this song should be rated with 18 years, just about 
every second word is a swear word. The song is called:

     SCUMBAG  (intellectual  text) and is dedicted  to  my  Maths 
               teacher.

Scumbag, Scumbag, you big fucking Scumbag
You bitch, you nag, you dick-sucking Scumbag
Hey, Scumbag, Scumbag, you goddamn fucking scumbag
You make me sick you little prick
You big fucking Scumbag

You are just a dick, dick, dick, dick, dick (repeated 4 times)

Scumbag, Scumbag, you fudge-packing Scumbag
You cunt, you fag, you butt-fucking Scumbag
Hey Scumbag, Scumbag, you shit-eating Scumbag
Hope you die in a ditch you little bitch
Oh, what a Scumbag, Scumbag !

I bet that this song contains the most swear-words you have  ever 
read  in one song,  if you have a song that contains  more,please 
send it to me and I will include it in the next issue. 


This next song is dedicated to Tim Moss (Manikin) and is called:

     PLAYBOY SUBSCRIBER

Oh baby, I really love you
And when we're close, I want to show my love to you
Cause you're the lawyer my hearts the case
And the only thing left to do is...

Come all over your fucking face !!

I am going to stick it up your ass
You don't even have to ask
You don't even have to beg
I'm just looking for a shot of leg

And I'm gonna come, come, come all over your face
I'm foona come, come , come all over your fucking face

I'm gonna stick it in your ear
It's gonna make it hard to hear
The love songs I sing to you
Then I'll tell you what I am going to do

I am going to stick it in your nose
We're gonna see how far it goes
And you know you shouldn't run
Oh Jesus Christ this is fun....

Have  you  read the article on all the members of the  Lost  Boys 
yet?  Well,  then you probably knoe what is says at Manikin's sex 
and this is also why this song was dedicated to him!       

By the way, all these songs are on the album called "SOMETHING TO 
PROOVE".


At  this  moment it is 12.18 am in the morning and  while  typing 
this I am watching a stupid western. This western is dead boring.
Uups,  I have just jawned gain, I suppose that I should go to bed 
and  continue  this article tomorrow morning,  but then  again  I 
might as well finish it right now.

Do  you  know that it is right now 12.35 and that  means  that  I 
haven't typed anything for the last 17 minutes,  I think that  we 
will have to change that.

Tomorrow  I  will  be  going to another  gig,  this  time  it  is 
Sepultra,  a brazilian trash metal band. I have seen them before, 
last time they were supporting Sodom. 

Now, let's get back to computer talk, I have just been talking to 
Zae  of Next and he asked me whether I would like to come to  his 
place in the sommer holidays,  I have not said yes or no yet, but 
I assume that I will go there!!! 
This  magazine will be released in a weeks time,  exactly on  the 
1st of June.  I have chosen that date because it is in the middle 
of the Atari Show here in London.  Hopefully I will have received 
the  ST Charts by Next.  The show is going to be quite  good,  as 
Budgie  UK will have a stand there (although they are sharing  it 
with 16/32 PD library. I will probably spend most of the time at
Budgie's  stand  but I will also try to get a  few  originals  of 
various companies. 

Oh by the way ?  Have you seen the film Licence to kill yet ?  It 
is very very good,  it has some horny women in it.  In fact there 
are  two  really nice ones!!!!!  You really do not want  to  know 
where  one of them keeps her gun.  Why am I telling you  about  a 
film  ?  This  is supposed to be a computer  magazine.  The  only 
explanation I have got for that is that I am running out of ideas 
of what to write. 

Manikin called this disk magazine a very very long scrolline,  to 
some  extend  that is true,  but then again this  disk  mag  also 
contains lodsa serious stuff. 

The  real bonus for finding this hidden article is that I am  now 
informing  you  about  a  new LOST BOYS  product  which  will  be 
released in the near future.  What means near future  ?  Well,  I 
personally do not know what that means.  If you want to know more 
about  this  forthcoming demo,  read on after this next  song  by 
Kreator....

EXTREME AGGRESSSION

Extreme Agressions
From an extremely insane mind
Resting unconscious
Pushed up by white lines
Inhuman violence
I necer thought it would come this far
Sadistic intensions
My greed for blood is growing more and more 

Extreme Aggressions
Seeing you suffer brings pleasure to me
Extreme aggressions
My aggressions became to extreme to be
kept under control

Hallucinations
From the darkest part of my brain
I still can't believe it
Am I really insane
I heard your pleading
But no one hears the screams of this soul of mine

Extreme Aggressions
Seeing you suffer brings pleasure to me
Extreme aggressions
My aggressions became to extreme to be
kept under control

Society, what have you done to me
Society, bring you to your knees

Once before I die
Now that I have lost the will to live
Once before I die
I'll take revenge on those who've led me to 

Extreme Aggressions
My emotions, twisted by your lies
Extreme Aggressions
Condemned my soul to hell for all time


Finished  reading  this weird song ?  If you still there  I  must 
assume that you really like our demos because otherwise you would 
not read all this crap.  Anyway, this new product is not going to 
be a big demo,  it is just going to contain 3 screens.  The  main 
menu will consists of a bouncing TLB logo, a great 4 channel tune 
composed by Spaz(tic).  The song contains a great speech from  an 
interview  with  the American Speed/Hardcore Thrash  band  called 
GWAR.  I  presume that you have read quite a bit of this band  in 
this article cause they are very good/funny.  During their  gigs, 
they  splash fake blood over the audience,  the only problem  is, 
that you cannot remove the blood afterwards, it stains. Let's say 
some  more  about  the  demo.  The main menu  will  also  have  a 
scroller.  One of the screen will be the screen you know already, 
it  is  going  to be the intro screen  from  the  disk  magazine. 
Another  one of the screen has something to do with 3D  routines, 
but  they  are  this  time a lot faster  than  the  ones  in  the 
Mindbumb demo.  I won't tell you what they do,  so wait until the 
demo is going to be released. We do not know how long it is going 
to  take  until  we will finish  it.....  Let's  have  some  more 
musix from the great album Extreme Aggression....:  


NO REASON

Growing up like any other child
Like millions of others before
A statistic living exactly by the norm
Don't need to think about the future now
It's already decided for you
You have all you need so don't ask for more

Existing like the rest
In endless emptiness
Manipulated slaves
From the womb until the grave
You never had a chance
They put you in a trance
Against your will

No reasonto exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist

Year by year and day by day you feel the need to escape
You realize that you're not the same
But you're too uncertain to make a step
Away from their false truth
But remember how fast you loose the years of youth

Existing like the rest
In endless emptiness
Manipulated slaves
From the womb until the grave
You never had a chance
They put you in a trance
Against your will

No reasonto exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist


Oh  man,  you must be desperate for information if you are  still 
reading all this here but as I am feeling really bored with  this 
article here I will stop now.  If I feel like it, I will continue 
with it tonight!!!

                 Finito,  Schluss,  Aus,  Ende, End, fin


LOVE US OR HATE US

Don't try to tell us what is right for us
We don't give a fuck anyway
Don't try to steal imagination from us
things we believe we will never betray

Those who have the power to
Suck us dry - throw us away
those who never could create
Destroy the music of today
Those devoid pf any feeling
Those who make the compromise 
Betray themselves to make a deal
Sell their soul at any price

Sounds without feeling, energy or aggression
From money hungry brains and not from the heart 
Fortune, fame and glory are their obsessions
Salesmen, deaf to muisc, blind to art

No honesty, just sterility
A cautious sound they make without creativity
It's still the same as another age
When they took the words of truth and put them to a flame

No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us

Some have eyes and still can't see
Their plastic noise is anything but music to me
Mechanized and computerized
Switch off your brain and make sounds that dehumanize

No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us

Don't try to take our dreams amway from us
We will never be like you
Love us or hate us, it doesn't matter to me 
We don't want to be part of this sick society

Those who have a passion to
Will nerver change our way of life
We may not think the way you do
But we know that we are right
Those who want to form a world 
Of trends and monotony
Have to do it without us
Cause we always will be free


STEAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

There is no difference between death and life
Just a circle to be closed by time
Creature comforts in this earthly plane
Have become more hallowed than wisdom today

In the stream of consciousness
We cannot see the truth 
Play your role so perfectly 
No matter which life we choose
Emotional terror confusing our minds 
Love and hate keeping us blind 
Pretend death is the end of the line
Expect reward in paradise
In the stream of consciousness 
We cannot see the truth 
Play your role so perfectly 
No matter which life we choose

Linving in an ice age, emotions gone numb
The truth once so near but now so
 far away
So turn another page, get our daily 
 work done
All the nightmares are clear and
 happening today

Mindless fools, obey all rules
Lost all wort, born to serve

Emotional terror confusing our minds 
Hate and love is keeping us blind
Creature in this earthly plane
Have become more hallowed than wisdom today

There is no difference between death and life
Just a circle  to be closed by time
Pretend death is the edn of the line
Expect reward in paradise

In the stream of consciousness
We cannot see the truth 
Play your roleso perfectly
No matter which life we choose


SOME PAIN WILL LAST

Intence decastation of nature 
Construction a future for man
The worl is sold dirt cheap
For promises no one can ever keep
There's no hope, just decay
Creation leads only to chaos

The very fist years of your life 
Mother makes things right
But soon you just cannot deny
This is only a lie
We live in a world of hate and deceit, corruption and greed
Just wait my friend, you will see
Misery's coming your way, horror and pain reserved for you

Some pain will last, last forever

Eternal slaves of morbid minds
Helpless and blind 
Dealers of heartless oppression
Controlling mankind
Resistance is quelled, its birth incomplete, no chance to succeed
And those, those who don't care if you live or die
Are never around to shoulder the blame

Some pain will last, last forever

Time, the time flies fast you will feel
Still a child yet tomorrow you'll be
A man full of hopes and of dreams
Dreams are destroyed easily

Prepare, prepare for soem pain yet unknown
Planned and arranged for so long
Chemical mutants arise
A generation born just to die
Born just to die, a whole generation born just to die!


BETRAYER

This is a song which I use to describe what I feel
About people like you
No sense for humanity, no idea about life
This premise has been proved
You used my trust to satisfy your brainless lust
Your word isn't worth more than puke in the dust

Betrayer
Betrayer

Misleader, you twisted things to satisfy
Deceiver, this greedy lust you can't deny
How could I be so naive to believe all the lies
You so easily told
I think I've learned my lesson too late
The story took time to unfold
Now I see your true face
Behind your mask, a cheat, a fake
Your word isn't worth more than puke in the dust

Betrayer
Betrayer

Ignorant twisted mind, maybe it would help
To think before you speak from time to time
Pretend to be a friend of mind 
But he would sell your mother if you could
For less than a dime

Intelligence lost, brain deceased,
So you will loose, fall to your knees
Guys like you I cannot stand
Maybe I must speak another language before you understand

Betrayer
Betrayer


DON'T TRUST

The only truth I've ever heard 
Is the truth that I've spoken myself
A pack of lies is all I get from anybody else
Experience shows me I'm right
Deceit is the only game in sight
So be careful what you choose to believe

You can't believe in nothing
Insane to trust in anything 
So I don't trust in no one but myself

What happend to your honesty
Did it take a back seat to your greed
Forgotten cause you found out you need to live a lie
And if you question why you have a future without security
Just fear and lies and terror  
No one can tell you why

Synthetic creatures ordered and numbered 
Unsympathetic to everyone
Death of intelligence and emotions 
Preordained from death to day one

Lost trust in the future
Lost faith in prophecies
Lost truth in government promises
Lost hope for honesty


BRINGER OF TORTURE

Young girl so sweat and once so innocent
Your life so brutal, true emotions suppressed
You scream but he won't hear word till he's had his way
Victim of the cruelest kind of love

Against his urges there is no defence
The one who gave you life stole your innocence 
You want to be at any cost
But you're changed by the shame
And everything seems to be lost

Bring rough torture


You're not afraid of dying 
Nothing could be worse than this life
You terrofied of the pain
The pain that returns with the night

Bring rough torture

Insanity and terror, hand in hand
Till childhood dreams come to an end
This situation, so vile and insane,
will never be over
He's coming back again, again and again


FATAL ENERGY

Lies, I can't stand these lies anymore
These tales about a better world 
A better world for you and me
Hate, our hate is growing, that's for sure
Future thoughts fill us with rage
Uncertainty about aour fate

Cry out in fear of the future
Cry out in fear of the unknwon
Cry out in fear for our planet
That the human race calls its own

And the gods are watching from lofty places 
Indifferent to you and me
I wonder if their creations can handle 
The violent forces of fatal energy

Violence, cruel violence, in the minds of all 
The killer instinct is still intact
It never leaves our minds alone
Greed, our greed will cause us to fall
Destry the land of unborn sons
I hear them cry, I hear them call

Screaming in desperation
Screaming from hunger and pain
Screaming for relief from this misery
Searching for someone to blame
 
And the gods are watching from lofty places 
Indifferent to you and me
I wonder if their creations can handle 
The violent forces of fatal energy
  
Easy, it's so easy to control our fate
Turn the world into a bomb 
That destiny will detonate
Tomorrow, tomorrow will be too late
When the children cry in fear of death
A horrid death they can't escape

Crying tears of confusion 
Crying for they don't understand
Crying because their young lives 
Will be taken by their creators' hands

And the gods are watching from lofty places 
Indifferent to you and me
The test is through, the human race destroyed
Destroyed by the fatal energy

                The End
