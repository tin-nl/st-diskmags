                              by Sammy Joe of TLB

Hello  again,  it's  about time for another article  with  loadsa 
grammer,  spelling and expression mistakes (as my English teacher 
would probably say). So let's get started.

Well, the program I am about to review is a program which I coded 
a  few  years back for Microdeal,  so here's its  history(if  you 
don't  want to read the history,  just skip the next 3 pages  and 
start reading where it says "I reckon........)...... .

Once upon a time there was a Lost Boy and a Computer Show.  (That 
was around the time when our Power Demo was released).  This Lost 
Boy was with his friends at this computer show showing off  their 
new demo. The Lost Boy's name was Sammy Joe, already then he  had 
a  nose for business and money.  He went into the arcade  section 
and  loaded up their demo on every machine,  he even  managed  to 
sell  a few copies to some admires.  There also was another  Lost 
Boy with  the name Manikin who wanted to earn some  quick  money, 
programming a game for a computer company. So Sammy Joe suggested 
to show  their demo to various Software Companies.  At first 
Manikin didn't really want to, but then, he began to get used  to 
the idea and we started off.

The  software  house we decided to show it to first was  in  fact 
Microdeal. As you probably know, the Power Demo contains  various 
hacked  pieces  of  musix. Now, what would  you   expect  from  a 
manager  of a company when he sees that the demo  contains  musix 
from his games ?  Well,  John Symes saw red (he did  not actually
see  red,  but  his face became red  as  the  redest tomatoe). He
calmed himself quickly when a Lost  Boy  mentioned that Microdeal
was greeted in the scrolline. 

When Sammy Joe started talking,  John Symes stopped him  abruptly 
and asked: "Are you German or  what ?  Your accent  is definitely
not  English." Sammy Joe,  confused as  he  was, replied that his
nationality is German and that  he  has  been living  in  England
for some time now.  John Symes suddenly began to  smile all  over
his  face  and asked Sammy Joe  whether  he  would  be interested
in translating game manuals for him ?  Sammy Joe was so surprised
so that he agreed. Manikin who was more interested in a 
programming job didn't get anything (Everybody say "ahhh").

A  few  weeks later Sammy Joe got  his  first  translation!!!  It 
was  Goldrunner,  Karate Kid,  Jupiter Probe and an  some other 
game !!!

Shortly  after that,  John Symes asked whether Sammy Joe  (bloody 
hell,  do  you know that it is very hard to write of yourself  in 
the third person singular ? Anyway, I am going to stop that now.)         
could write a little program for him that would play a 7.5 Khz 
Sample and display a picture in either colour or high resolution.
John Symes wanted the program made so that he only would have  to 
put a sample and a picture on the disk and that the program would
do the rest. The reason why he wanted 7.5 Khz was, that he wanted
to fit as much sampled speech as possible on one single sided 
disk.

I  reckon  that  wraps  just about the  history  of  this  little 
program. In the next few lines you will find the instructions for 
the program, oh, oh, it is so hard to use !!!!

INSTRUCTIONS (for the use with ST Replay and Degas)

  1.Select  the sampling frequency to 7.5 Khz (don't  make  the 
    sample longer than 330 k) 
 2. Sample a tune (preferably Heavy Metal)
 3. Save it on the disk called "Heavy.spl" 
 4. Have a break
 5. Load Degas
 6. Draw a picture
 6.1. Get your mono emulator out, load degas again, draw another 
      picture,  save it as "Heavy.pi3",  now your demo will also  
      run on a monochrome monitor
 7. Select it to uncompressed
 8. Save the picture as "Heavy.pi1"
 9. Install an Auto folder on the disk
10. Copy the program on the disk
11. Protect your disk(we don't want it to be blanked by a virus) 
12. Reset your computer
13. Enjoy your little sample demo


If  you  do not like the names under which you had  to  save  the 
files, use a disk monitor to change the filenames.
With  this  program you cannot do perfect sample  demos,  as  the 
sample will only loop.  
I quite often use this program,  not to do sample demos, but when 
I want to talk to a friend of mine who doesn't live here in  good 
old  England.  What  I just do is,  I talk something  onto  tape, 
sample  it  and copy it on the disk.  And the  spoken  letter  is 
finished.   You  usually  get  the  sample  quality  to  a  quite 
acceptable  standard.  Now this way you save a lot of  money  you 
would  otherwise  have to spend on the telephone  bill  !!!  Your 
friend  who  is going to receive this letter will also  be  quite 
surprised.

If you are not happy with the 7.5 Khz sample rate, tuff luck. 

Either  this  issue or the next issue will  contain  an ASSEMBLER 
source  code  with which you can easily create  your  own  sample 
demos.  We  will explain to you in every detail what you have  to 
change  in order to have a different frequency,  so that you  can 
have  different  samples in your demo and therefore  improve  the 
length of it. 
There will also be a scroller on the screen along with a picture. 

I  have just reached the end of the second A4 page in First  Word 
plus and therefore I will finish this article off.
