Oh  god,  what  has the world come to nowadays ?  You  even  need 
somebody to tell you what to do in the demos...

Anyway,  with  this  article I will try to inform you  of  hidden 
screens  keys  you can press and whatever else is  worth  knowing 
about demos.


Let's start with one of the latest demos, the 


SWEDISH NEW YEAR DEMO II 

This demo here features a hidden screen.  Yuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhuuuu, 
yuppiee.  Well,  that  hidden screen is not that amazing  but  it 
still is quite funny I suppose. 
What you have to do is, press the Shift key which is the furthest 
away  from  that  little light on your  computer  that  indicates 
whether or not your  computer is switched on. 
For  people who did not quite get that,  here's what you have  to 
do in plain English:  Press the LEFT SHIFT key while the demo  is 
loading (press it as soon as you switch your computer on!!!).
You will soon realize that it does load longer than  usual.  What 
you will get is AN COOL talking some rubbish in  Swedish,  that's 
what is sounds to me.
Problem: This hidden screen does not appear to be on all the demo 
versionsandifitisthere,youwillhavesomedifficultyin
accessingit,youmustkeeptryingituntilitworks.


THE DEFINITIVE DEMO

There is no hidden screen there, BUT there is a hidden key, go to 
the  musix  screen,  press  either HELP or UNDO  (I  can't  quite 
remember which key it is).  Now go back to the main menu and  try 
to load the Big Scroll....  By pressing the key,  you changed the 
program so, so that the disc accessing routine for this screen is 
switched off. 
If  you do want to piss your friend off,  run the Warhawk  musix. 
Now look what happens..... 


VDU BY R.KARSMAKERS

Have you ever noticed that there is a small black pixel in the 
right upper part of the screen on the main menu? Try clicking on
it and you will be awarded with a few hiiden function!!!!


XTC DEMO BY THE ALLIANCE from Germany (Release Date: 30.4.90)

If you are interested in the latest news,  get your disk  monitor 
out,  read  in the bootsector.  Go through the sectors until  you 
find some text. They will give you some additional information on 
the demo. 
When you have finished reading this, go to Track 78, move through 
the sectors until you find some more text. At the end of the text 
they want you to type in your own message.  


THE MINDBOMB DEMO BY THE LOST BOYS

The so called hidden screen in this demo is not really hidden, it 
is  the VECTOR screen.  What you have to do to get to the  screen 
is, climb up most of the ladder and then walk right. And here you 
are in front of the Vector Door.
If  you want to catch up on some slagging  off/news/latest  jokes 
get  your disk monitor out and go through the disk starting  with 
the bootsector.  There are various messages throughout the  whole 
disk.  Check this out: Track 80 and the following................
You programmers might find  some very useful things......
Have you found the hidden screen in the Mindbomb demo yet ? No, I 
am not talking about the Vector screen, it's another screen. This 
screen  is hidden in there where there are a few  brownish  balls 
put  above each other (it looks like a triangle).  On top of  the 
last ball, the is a sign that says SPAZ. In front of these balls, 
there is a hidden screen.  I really do not know why I am  telling 
you all this,  the screen is supposed to be hidden.  I don't want 
to make it too easy for you,  so I am not going to tell you  what 
you  have  to press/type in order to enter  the  screen.  If  you 
still  can't enter the screen,  wait until the next  issue,  I'll 
tell you then.
