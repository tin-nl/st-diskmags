                                   Review by Sammy Joe of TLB


Monday  morning,  10 o' clock,  you rush  downstairs,  open  your 
letter  box and find a package full of disks from  your  contact. 
Quickly  you  open the package,  get the  disks  out,  rush  back 
upstairs, switch your computer on and insert the first disk, what 
a  surprise,  it is yet another AUTOMATION MENU.  God you  think, 
they  are already up to Menu 467.  Inserting the second disk  you 
hope that it contains the long awaited Mindbomb demo by the  Lost 
Boys.  And it does....

The screen turns black and some text comes up on the  screen,  as 
usual  you get some boring information about the demo,  like  for 
example  that the disk is 81 tracks and 10 sectors,  Licensed  to 
Budgie UK, that you can buy the source code and much more.....

Anyway,  finally getting to the actual loader you can see a cute, 
little  pinkish Carebear sitting innocently on the left  side  of 
the screen.  Soon you realise that something doesn't fit in  this 
harmony.  On the Carebears belly you can see three  letters,  no, 
it doesn't say TLB, it says TCB, which if you don't, although you 
should  know is an abbreviation for The Carebears.  Abruptly  the 
harmony  is broken by the sudden appearance of a boxing glove  on 
the  right side of the screen.   As what to expect from a  boxing 
glove,  it  starts to beat the Carebear.  Along with  the  moving 
of  the  glove you get a nice sample from the film  Robocop  (you 
know, the one with the human machine. It's the scene when Robocop 
throws  some  guy  out of the window).  When  the  glove  finally 
reached the Carebear, you get a really nasty laugh (it's the best 
laugh I have ever heard you say to yourself). 

The  screen  then turns black again and the new  LOST  BOYS  logo 
appears on the screen,  the logo is really nice again,  The  only 
problem is that it says  LOST BOVS. No, just kidding, SPAZTIC has 
just drawn the T upside down !    Somewhere in the middle of  the 
sign you can see some very small triangles,  at least what  seems 
like triangles.  If you have a monitor and some insider knowledge 
you know that the triangles are supposed to stand for WIZ CODERS.

Now,  after  that you get just like  in any other big  demo  more 
information  on the upcoming screen,  like in this case  it  says 
that  the  musix is by MADDI MAX,  all  coding  by  Wanikin,  all 
graphix and the Megadeth font by Spazzie.   These screens  appear 
throughout  the  whole demo in order to inform you who  has  done 
what etc...

In  the main menu you again confronted with great graphix  and  a 
nice tune of MAD MAX.  As one was told earlier on,  you must  use 
the  cursor keys in order to move around.  You must move a  small 
red bearded man around, he can climb ladders, fall from one level 
to  another one,  enter doors etc...  The screen uses the  famous 
sync  scrolling technique which was first used in  the  Carebears 
Cuddly  demo.  Therefore  it  gives  you  the  smooth  fullscreen 
scrolling. Apparently this version of the sync scrolling works on 
every machine, even the Atari STE.  

Now,  starting  to  walk around with this little tramp  you  have 
decided  to start examining a guest screen in  the  demo.  You 
begin with Digital Insanity's first  screen. This screen contains 
one of these scrollers which are impossible to read.  There is  a 
normal scroller in the bottom border bouncing up and down.  Above 
that there is a bouncing and wobbling Mindbomb logo.  Now,  above 
that  are  the  impossible to read  scrollers.  There  are  three 
different scrollers,  they are all twist scrollers,  BUT they are 
not horizontal, they are vertical. It looks very very nice.  

Walking on and on you finally get to the first screen of the Lost 
Boys,  the Moving Backgroud screen. This screen is very boring in 
comparison with the others,  it only has a scroller,  to be  more 
exact,  it's the Arista scroller,  The background is also  moving 
around  in eight different directions.  There are also  two  Lost 
Boys logos spinning around.                 

The  next screen you'll probably look at is the excellent  screen 
that has been converted from the Amiga to the Atari,  it's the so 
called  Red  Sector screen.  When you first look at  the  screen, 
the  beginning  reminds  one of the menu sprites  from  the  game 
Afterburner.  BUT as usual, TLB (The Lazy Bastards) have improved 
it  a lot,  the sprites have many more colours,  the move  a  lot 
faster,  they  have  a shadow at the bottom,  they have  a  three 
dimensional effect. The 3D effect has been achieved by moving the 
sprites closer together the further back they are. 
There  are many different waveforms,  one of them  is  especially 
very good,  first you get a NAKED MAN (yeah, that's something for 
the perverts out there).  But then, what's a man without a woman, 
so  the LOST BOYS created a woman for the lonely man.  There  are 
many  more  waveforms after that,  like the helicopter  with  the 
spinning rotor. This screen is one of the most impressive screens 
in the demo!!!!!

Another  screen you will find on this side of the screen  is  the 
Landscroll  screen.  This  screen is very pleasing for  the  eye. 
There  are some sprites moving in bizarre forms,  two  LOST  BOYS 
logos growing and shrinking and moving around.  There is also the 
bit after which the screen was named,  the moving scroller.  This 
scroller  goes into the distance just like the Starwars  scroller 
from the Cuddly demo,  only that you can change the direction  on 
this one,  you can make it go left or right.  This little feature 
gives the screen a very special effect!!!!  There is also a  very 
nice starfield in the screen!!!
      
The screen which I personally like most is the Para Screen, it is 
just right of the Red Sector Screen.  This screen has many, and I 
mean many colours.  The colours aren't just colours,  they are so 
well chosen so that the effect you get is superb.  If there still 
is  an  Amiga owner who doesn't believe that the ST  can  produce 
more  than 16 colours,  this is the screen you should  show  him. 
Anyway,  there aren't just colours in this screen,  they are also 
some  sprites  and  a fullscreen scroller  with  some  marvellous 
colourbars  in it.  Behind that you can see the whole  background 
moving. God, I just love the colours in this screen. 

After having looked at the Para Screen for half an hour I finally 
managed  to get a hold of myself and continue with DI's  Ah  Yeah 
screen. It's another one of the hard to read screens, there is so 
much  scrolling  around,  it  drives  you  bonkers.  Anyway,  the 
background is moving again,  there are lodsa scrollers on top  of 
that, another scroller on top of them at the top of the screen, a 
sign saying Digital Insanity moving from left to right,  oh,  oh, 
it just drives you madmx!!!

The next screen I have decided to look at is the Sinus Screen. As 
the name says it contains some sinus dots,  they are not as  good 
as the sinus dots in the So Watt demo,  but as there are quite  a 
few things happening at the same time,  I think that it makes  up 
for  it.  There  are  three  copies of  the  Sinus  dots  on  the 
screen(plus  the shadow in the bottom border).  Above  the  sinus 
dots  is  a scroller,  with of course the shadow  in  the  bottom 
border.  At  the  top of the screen is a non visible  bar  around 
which some text spins,  the text is written in the great Megadeth 
and the Arista Font.  The text wrapped around the bar informs you 
who participated in the production of  the demo.

Well,  Camy from Budgie just rang me in order to tell me that  he 
received the demo and that he is going to distribute it  quickly. 
When  I asked him which screen he really likes,  he said  the  3D 
Mega  Balls screen.  So I decided to go on with  that  one.  This 
screen features the arista scroller,  a nice starfield,  a shadow 
of the main attraction which are the 3D Mega Balls.  First  there 
is  nothing  on  the  screen,  then there is  a  bad  flicker  (I 
shouldn't have said that, Manikin is probably going to beat me up 
now)  on  the  left side of the screen and after  that  the  main 
attraction comes towards you from the distance.  These mega balls 
then bounce around, do various shapes and then disappear again in 
the distance. That goes on and on with many different waveforms..

No from that screen we first go right, climb up a ladder, then go 
left,  climb  a  ladder again and go left and  enter  the  screen 
called  BBC.  This screen is by some good friends of  ours.  They 
screen  starts off by showing some volume indicators in  the  top 
right corner of the screen. Behind the volume indicators there is 
a Mindbomb logo wobbling,  going on down from that you will  find 
most of the screen is used for some great paralaxing (??), on top 
of  the  paralaxing  there  is a nice  piece  of  Graphix  saying 
Mindbomb!!  Around that piece of graphix you can see quite a  few 
sprites spinning around.  A bit further down,  the BAD BREW  CREW 
have decided to open the left,  the right and the bottom  border. 
In  these  borders  that  have some kind of  a  twist  scroll  or 
whatever  you  dare to call it.  It's the same  scroller  wrapped 
around  itself  a few times.  Anyway,  that's a very  nice  guest 
screen.

Leaving  this door,  you go to the right and enter the  Scrolling 
Massacre by the LOST BOYS.  It's another very nice screen (one of 
the screens which Manikin likes the most, but then again he likes 
all  the screens he has coded).  It starts off with  lodsa  small 
scrollines  in the background,  after that a scroller bounces  or 
should I rather say wobbels in on the top with its shadow at  the 
bottom  ?  Oh,  damn,  I  just about forgot that there  are  some 
scollers scrolling up from the bottom. And now, to top everything 
off,  there comes a enlarged version of the MEGADETH font in  the 
middle of the screen.  The font looks really good,  just like the 
one from the album cover!!!

Now go right until the little tramp( it's not really supposed  to 
be a tramp,  it's supposed to be a heavy metal freak) falls  down 
onto the next layer and there walk left until you reach the  door 
saying  LOST BOYS PD.  This screen contains  nothing  spectacular 
except left/right border,  a big wobbling sign,  some colour bars 
and a moving background.  The important bit about this screen  is 
the  scroller  because  this  very  scroller  is  another   twist 
scroller, which is again wrapped around a bar. The scroller tells 
you  about the LOST BOYS PD LIBRARY.  The scroll also  tells  you 
about this Disk Magazine and some other important things!!!!

Ooooooohhhhhh  nooooo,  not another screen by Digital Insanity  I 
hear you say.  What,  you complain that they are tooooo good, you 
say  that they always make you cry ?  Well,  just get yourself  a 
tissue. P.S.: This screen is called NO SHIT.  
This  screen  uses hardare scrolling,  so you'll have  to  expect 
quite  a few things moving,......................what  was  that, 
you  want  me to get on with the facts and stop that  bull  shit, 
well, well, don't get rude !!!  To keep you waiting a bit longer, 
here's a joke:

     - How can you tell that your sister has her period ?            
     - Your fathers dick tasts different.   

Anyway,  after this dirty joke let's get down to business  again, 
the screen starts off with a scroller at the top,  after that,  a 
background  appears  and  starts  scrolling,  then  another  full 
screen  text scroller begins to scroll up and finally you  get  a 
bouncing  scroller with colourbars from the left to the  right!!! 
It  looks  very nice,  although the bouncu scroller looks  a  bit 
weird. 

Next to that screen is another screen by Digital  Insanity,  it's 
his very very good sprites screen.  There are millions of sprites 
which  you  can move around in the screen,  a few  waveforms  are 
preselected,  like  one  of  them makes the  sprites  bigger  and 
smaller,  god,  that looks really disgusting!!!!  Anyway, this is 
another very good screen. 

The  next  screen is the VECTOR screen which  is  the  sort-ofish 
hidden  screen,  have you managed to get there  yet  ?  So,  this 
screen  contains  some very very fast 3d routines  along  with  a 
really nice starfield and a big scroller. The only really exiting 
thing  about  this  screen  are the very  fast  vectors  and  the 
starfield.  The vectors say LOST BOYS and get bigger and smaller, 
althrough  this  screen  is  a  bit  boring,  it  is  still  very 
impressive.

Another  one of the not so good screens in this demo is  the  BIG 
SPRITE screen.  This screen has nothing special  whatsoever,  (we 
throught of taking it off quite often,  but in the end we decided 
to leave it in). As the name already says, there is a big sprite. 
In  order  to  make everything big in this  screen  we  used  the 
enlarged  version of the MEGADETH font.  To fill  the  background 
there is a starfield.  This screen is a so called space filler (a 
very big space filler).

The last guest screen in this demo is by Chuck the Fox,  it has a 
very  nice starfield,  (it is one of the best starfields  I  have 
ever seen. By pressing the arrow keys, you can make the starfield 
either  turn left or right.  With the keys 1 to 9 you can  change 
the  colour of the Starfield which has some nice  effects.  There 
are three big sprites saying FOX moving around the screen.  There 
is  also  some  text fading in and  out,  which  tells  you  some 
interesting information.

Now,  finally the last screen and therefore the biggest screen on 
the disk.  It's the DIGI SYNTH screen.  Finally at long last, the 
Lost  Boys have there own 4 track sample player.  The quality  is 
bloody (Don't mind me swearing) good,  the samples are very clear 
and also very loud at the same time.  There are some four  volume 
indicators in the middle of the screen,  another starfield in the 
background, a scroller at the top of the screen and a sign saying 
MEGA COOL fades in from time to time.  You can choose one out  of 
6 different tunes which were all composed by SPAZ of TLB. 

Now,  as  I  have just given you a quick guide  through  all  the 
screens  of  the Mindbomb demo you can make up your mind  if  you 
like this demo or not,  but be warned,  I tell you that it is the 
best demo ever produced on the Atari ST.  So, don't you ever dare 
to say something different from that.     

Oh,  I just about forgot, there is another screen. It's a pain in 
the  neck but just about every good demo has  it,     yes,   well 
done,  it's the RESET Demo. The reset demo exists of some more 3D 
stuff,  well,  stuff doesn't say much, does it ? The 3D lines say 
LOST BOYS again,  this time they have a shadow.  At the bottom of 
the screen is a scroller that gives you our address again (if you 
don't know it yet!!). 

So, that's about sums it up, here is my summary (I'm going to try 
to do it as objective as possible!!):

If you would like a copy of this demo, you can get it from our PD 
library.  For further info on how to obtain it, read in the other 
articles. (Disk 400).

My  fingers really hurt now,  this file contains 2752  words  and 
therefore  is pretty long!!!!  I am going to have some food  now, 
extra, extra, you can't live without it!!!!
