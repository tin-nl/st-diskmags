This article is probably  one of the most interesting  articles on
this disk  because it contains all the things you  ever  wanted to 
know about the Lost Boys. It will also tell you a load of bollocks
but Mike is desperate to fill this disk up so it looks good so you
will have to put up with it.If you want to read a more interesting
article than this one you  should try reading the Desktop.inf file 
found on most disks, or you can even try making your own 
Desktop.inf file. 

Only joking, you should read the other articles on the disk.
