
ROUND UP BY BEN DOLLEY
  
    Well  that`s my first issue done.I know some of  the  reviews 
aren`t very good,but i think they are probably getting better.

Some Faults:In the P-47 review the game doesn`t just take part in 
France it plays over all different countries in the world.
  
    Sorry about that,but i noticed it when the review couldn`t be 
changed,so i hope you won`t think i am that stupid.
   As you have probably seen the game SHINOBI isn`t very good.The 
reason i gave such low marks and a crap rating of 100% is that  i 
think  that  Virgin  could  have  done  a  much  better  job.Some 
examples are that:
                  1.  The sound is really exactly the same as the 
Amstrad.Other sound effects are also bad.
                  2.The graphics  on the bonus level are awful  i 
could  have  seen better on the BBC.The graphics  for  the  ninja 
magic is crap and the graphics overall are pretty damn awful.  
   
   If you have any ideas for me which might improve my  reviewing 
please send a letter to :     Ben Dolley,
                                10 Cambridge Rd,

                                      TW11 8DR.
   
   Money and games would also be greatly appreciated(don`t  worry 
i`am only joking).Also if you have any tips which are not out  of 
magazines please send them as well.
