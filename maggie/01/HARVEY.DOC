                An Introduction - The Man Himself

Hi there!  Harvey Lodder here, author of the Music Player, a very 
good  program  which plays music and pictures at the  same  time. 
I've  been  asked  to type something for the  Lost  Boys  Margret 
Thatcher  magazine  (that's what Maggie  stands  for!),  so  here 
goes...

I'm a little older than my teeth,  but not as old as my mother???
This may sound weird to all you normal people out there, but it's 
true!  At the moment I'm single so if any of you female  Atarians 
who  live  in Berkshire want to contact me  than  please  do.

Speaking of The Lost Boys,  have you seen the Mindbomb Demo? It's 
got to be the best demo ever.  If you don't have the demo, then I 
suggest that you buy a copy of it and while you're at it,  buy  a 
copy  for  each of your friends just in case they  get  an  Atari 
ST(E).

On  the  Atari  STE I can only describe it as  a  machine  that's 
totally  full of shit and sounds like an Atari ST in a bucket  of 
water.  In fact I know TWO people who own an Atari STE. The first 
is  Paul Brennan and he get's really pissed off when half of  his 
games  don't  work and the other is  Ashley  Griffin.  Ashley  is 
seventeen  years old and lives at home with  his  parents.  Apart 
from  being  a  virgin,  Ashley is nearly normal  in  most  other 
respects apart from that he's proud to have an STE. Ha! Ha! Ha!

At the moment,  I'm still trying to think what to write about and 
the time is 12:28am on a Tuesday morning.........................

.................the time is now 2:53am on a Tuesday morning and 
I've just decided what to write about, Computer Farties.

THE PUB...

Are you a computer fartie? Of course your not! How often have you 
been down the pub with your mates and they mention good old Ivon 
Ernest who's standing by the bar, filofax under his arm, ordering 
a pint of Babycham.
"Look  at that bastard!  All he talks about is computers,  I hate 
 them, don't you?", gloat your thick as shit mates.

And  I bet you agree with them.  I mean just think if  your  mates 
knew you had a computer?  Can you imagine what they would think of
you if they knew you were reading this?  Yeah,  you would lose all 
your street cred, and just think how uncool that would be.

As you sit down your local, downing your pints of Fosters, running 
into  the loo after every other pint and staggering  out  claiming 
that your a lad and you can hold your drink.  You know that you're 
really a fartie, just like Ivon Ernest.

How  often  have  you declined to go out  with  your  mates,  just 
because  you've got a hacked version of Alien Bastards From  Space 
and  you  want  to see what happens after  you  clear  that  final 
screen.  Now if they knew that you were sitting at home,  curtains 
tightly  shut,  just in case the neighbours or the window  cleaner  
might  see you playing with your computer,  they would claim  that 
they're to old for arcade games and you'd never catch them playing
them.  How  embarrasing for you,  I bet you'd want to curl up  and 
die...

But just picture what's happening down at the local,  Ivon  Ernest 
isn't there,  but the lads are. And what are they doing, yes, they 
are playing on a certain arcade machine called Alien Bastards From 
Space!  But  when  the time comes that you're with  them  and  you 
suggest to have a go on that arcade machine, I can  guarantee  you 
that they'll tell you to piss off and they're not like Ivon Ernest 
and they're to old for arcade games.

SHOPPING...

Now  hears a good one!  How often have you been in W.H.Smiths with 
your  mates and they just happen to be  standing reading the porno
mags.  Yes, you'd would rather stand there with your mates reading 
Penthouse  in front of all the customers and staff of  W.H.Smiths, 
then  you  would pick up a copy of New Computer Express  and  have 
your mates gloat, "Err! What the fuck are you doing with that?"
 
Now  that some of the Mega-Boots stock computer games  you  decide 
that  you'll sneak off and buy some  software while your mates  go 
to the aftershave counter to buy some Wild Stallion deodourent. So
after  picking  up your "A-Z OF BOOTS" and listening to  the  shop  
intercom  system  announcing "That you can buy twenty  bottles  of 
Raging Bull aftershave for the price of one",  you sneak off  into 
the depths of the Megastore.

And this is just like any other Megastore,  they have a nice  list 
of  floors  with all their different departments on them  next  to 
every  escalator.  But how many times have you tried to go  up  or 
down  to your desired floor and the escalator is going  the  other 
way. So you have to walk to the other side of the shop, but you've 
had  your  attention destracted so many  times,  by  kids  puking, 
strange objects that are scattered around on the various counters, 
the  school girl shop assistant with big tits or any other  thing, 
that  by  the  time  that you've  got  to  the  escalator,  you've 
forgotten what you wanted and the escalator is out of order so you 
have  to find the lift.  And by the time you get to  the  lift,  a 
kindly  shop  assistant  reminds you that the  lift  is  only  for 
disabled  people and he points you in the direction of the  stairs 
which are at the other end of the shop.  What do you do? You go to 
up  the  stairs into the electrical department to search  for  the 
computer games,  but can you find them no!  And why can't you find 
them,  the  reason is plain and simple.  The manager  thinks  that 
computers  are toys and you know that the toy floor is  below  the 
one that you just came from.  So your only option is to go back to 
your mates who have been wondering were you've got to.

And here ends part one of the Computer Fartie guide...
