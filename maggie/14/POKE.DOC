                          A POKE IN THE EYE
                          -----------------

                          By LEON O'REILLY

        Remember those glorious days of  Crash! and Your Sinclair when
the nearest you got to a trainer  was  a two page poke that took three
hours to type in and then  didn't  work  properly? Yes, those days are
back again as Maggie brings  you  'poke-city'.  Well a couple of pokes
anyway.

        Just recently there has been  the  release of an excellent new
spectrum emulator for the Falcon - written in 030 code it really gives
you the speed of  the  spec,  but  its  best  feature  is its built in
disassembler which allows you to fiddle around with all your favourite
spectrum programs.

        I just thought I'd share  a  few  pokes  that I'd come up with
recently. As my knowledge of  Z80  is  sparse, I haven't really delved
much into many  programs,  but  I've  made  a  start  with  some of my
favourite games.

        Using the disassembler  is  relatively straightforward. Simply
tap the escape key and you are then presented with a command line. For
these pokes you need to be able to use the following commands.

A - Start Address. After pressing this you will then have to type in
    the address you want to look at/change.
M - Alter Memory. You then say if you want to change memory as Bytes,
    Words or ASCII. Then you type in your changes with escape to end
    input.
U - Run Until. After this you specify an address.

        So simply tap escape, followed  by  the hotkey combination you
want, and then escape to exit back to program. Its simple really!

€JET SET WILLY II
================

The grandfather of platform  games  (sort  of).  This was about before
Sonic and Mario were a twinkle  in  a  programmers eyes. And its still
better than either of those...

I've come up with a number of cheats for this.

INFINITE LIVES: 7A16 = C3 B7

By this I mean you  type  'esc',  then  tap  'A', type '7A16' then 'M'
followed by 'b' (for byte) then  'C3' and 'B7'. Finish changing memory
with 'esc' and go back into JSWII with 'esc' again.

INVULNERABILITY: 79EF = C9

As before - 'esc', 'A', '79EF', 'M', 'B', 'C9', 'esc', 'esc'

The problem with invulnerability is  that  sometimes you get stuck and
need to die to get out. Change this back to normal with:

NORMAL: 79EF = C5

KILL MONSTERS: UNTIL 7BA7

That is Run Until 7BA7 - 'esc', 'U', '7BA7'

Monsters in your room will freeze,  and  once you move into subsequent
rooms they will have vanished!

3D DEATHCHASE
=============

Two little pokes for this chase through the trees!

INFINITE LIVES: 675F = 00
€
INVULNERABILITY: 670B = 00 00


BATTY
=====

One of the best versions of break-out for the Spectrum!

INFINITE LIVES: BD35 = 00
                BD39 = 20

(Both these values most be poked in to get infinite lives).

GROUND ATTACK
=============

Another oldie!

INFINITE LIVES: 7187 = 00

HYPERACTION
===========

This is a pretty smart game!

This cheat makes it very easy though...

INVULNERABILITY: A9D9 = 18

(also don't worry about time running out!)



Join me next time when  I'll  be  covering such classics as Ultimate's
Sabre Wulf amongst others.  If  you  have  any problems entering these
pokes, or want to request a game for me to poke drop me a line!
