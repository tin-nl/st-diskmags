What handle are you currently using?

- Quaser



What groups/affiliations are you currently a member of?

- Cynix




How old are you?

- 19


What is your function in the group?

- Original supplier, so obviously I'm somewhat redundant now.


How long have you been an ST user,and how long have you actually been
on the ST scene?

- Well I first brought my ST in about 1987 but I didn't really get
involved in the scene until about 1989-90.A year or so after that
I joined Cynix.


Would you consider yourself as being active on the ST scene - if not
what made you give up. If yes  then  what  about the good old ST keeps
you going?

-I've still got an STe but the fact that absolutely nothing comes out
for the ST means I hardly use  it. The  sad  fact is that I'd get so
little for the ST if I sold it that I might as well keep it.


With the ST truly in its sunset years what do you see as the next
machine to have?

-Unfortunately it seems the only machine worth buying at the moment is
a PC. The Falcon is too dear, and with too little software and having
an A1200 is really the same as having a  normal Amiga but with 2 Meg
(ie. Very Sad).A PC is also an investment as the PC can never die but
only grow or shrink in popularity.


Who on the ST scene past & present do you really respect?

-Any crew that spends that little bit of extra time to get everything
just right. Particularly the great demo  crews TCB, Overlanders, and
the such.  As far  as  cracker go the  Replicants, Superior, & Elite
are/were all good (not as good as Cynix though hehehe!!).

Who on the ST scene past & present do not respect?

- People who write demos in STOS,any menu group which can only pack
things already in files, people who  talk  bollocks  (no shortage of
them),people who tell you they're big on the Amiga scene,anybody who
uses the term 'Latest WareZ' apart from Craig 'cus he's allowed to.



At the time of writing this article FAST has made two busts of UK
bulletin boards and probably a half of all bulletin boards have since
closed. What do you think the future holds in store for the UK wares
board scene?

-When all the small time, rumour  spreading,  amiga owning arseholes
finally shut up everyone will realize that  unless you actually sell
copied software there is little to worry about (as yet) and so we can
go about the serious business of making sure all boards in the UK are
PC and console only!!

- The Krypt has been busted recently as well.


The Falcon is undoubtedly an accomplished machine but do you believe it
really has the ability to compete as a medium market computer?

- Unfortunately no. To use a Falcon  you  simply have to have a hard
disk and 4 Meg and the price of such a machine puts it into the mid to
high spec PC price bracket.Since the only thing the Falcon gives you
that the PC doesn't do particularly well is direct to disk sampling so
the Falcon will only be really successful in the music market (unless
Atari can screw that up as  well).  Now  the  PC has really boomed I
don't think the Falcon will ever find a  market,  now if it had been
released straight away with 2Mb for a œ399 price tag that would have
been a different story.

If money wasn't a problem what single machine would you buy right now?

- I would definitely go for a really high spec PC, probably a 100Mhz
Pentium with PCI bus, SCSI HD,and the sort of video card that costs
as much as a small family car.It's not that I think PC's are the be
all and end all of computers but until either Atari sorts itself out
or Commodore drops the whole  idea that  it can't make anything that
isn't an Amiga  there  won't be anything  else  on  the market worth
buying.


What are you're favourite games of all time?

- Atomix,  Atomino, Wings  of  Death,  Enchanted  Land, Lethal Xccess,
Monster Business, Vroom, Axelay (SNES),  Doom(PC),  Rebel Assault(PC
CD), Leavin' Teramis,  ThunderForces III  &  IV (MegaDrive), Quartet
(Master System)


Worst games of all time?

- Anything with  Mario in it, Elite II -  OK so its a good game but it
would have been better if David Braben  hadn't  done it.  Other true
baddies that deserve a mention are Terrestrial Encounter, Crazy Cars
II, Lethal Enforcers, Reebok,


Favourite Demos?

- The Big demo (especially  the  Digital Department), The Cuddly Demos
(TCB),Anomaly (MJJ Productions),Dark Side of The Spoon, Brain Damage
(Aggression)


Best films of all time?

- Star Wars, Where Eagles Dare, A Bridge Too Far, High Risk

Worst films of all time?

- George, Schindler's List,


Favourite TV progs?

- Only Fool & Horses, Have I got News for You,

Worst TV progs?

- Blind Date, You've Been Framed, Beadle's About


Up until  present Atari has  certainly  marketed  the Jaguar very well
with  a  lot  of  media  coverage   being  given  to  its  unsurpassed
capabilities but with Atari only  projecting a 500-750,000 sell-in US,
and 500,000 + in Europe during 1994  do you really think they have set
their sights high enough to compete  in the highly competitive console
market??

- In a word NO.  Sega sold 4 million MegaDrives in the last quarter of
'93 in the US alone. If  Atari  really  wants to attract large scale
software support then I would have thought a  global user base of at
least 3 million by the end of '94 is a must.


At the end of 1992  everyone thought  that  the Falcon was going to be
the next big thing, an ST for the ninetities if you like.  Over a year
on it seems to have a made a slightly smaller impression - what do you
think went wrong?

- Firstly  Atari moved too late, the Falcon should have been available
for the Christmas 92/93,and when it was finally released it was just
too much money.  The sudden boom in PC  popularity was, of course, a
major factor but basically the Falcon was  too little, too late, and
too expensive (much the same story as with the STe really).




What do you think 1994 holds in store for the Atari scene?

- The ST will die as a commercial machine, but probably stay popular
  with hobbyists.„("Willdie"??HASdiedsurely??-ED)€

- The Falcon will replace the Archimedes.

- The Lynx will enjoy a minature revival.

- Quite a few Jaguars will be sold  so Atari will put the price up and
not  release any games just to ensure  that  any glimmer of a bright
future is extinguished.

What would you most like to happen for Atari in the future?

- For the Jaguar to be successful, and for Atari to release a Jaguar
  based home computer.  And for Commodore to go bankrupt (more of a
  reality than many people think).

What do you think of:-

The Falcon 030?

- Better than the A1200.


The Atari Lynx?

- The  Lynx is the best handheld (just  look as Toki), but the kind of
sad individual who buys  a  handheld  isn't interested in technology
(Just look at the Gameboy).


The Jaguar?

- Better than  3D0 and cheaper than 3D0.  Pity about the games at the
  moment.



The Jaguar CD-ROM?

- Essential,  with a CD-Rom people will realize they can play PC games
as good as or better on a machine  that costs about a quarter of the
price of a PC.

Manga?

- Gives  SNES magazines something to write about and cover up the fact
that not many games are coming out.


Apple MAC?

- Nice snazzy cases, but apart from that - CRAP!


Power MAC?

- Nice, but no games!.


The Edge?

- Latin name:  Magazinus Full  of  Shitus.   But really nice look,
style, great screenshots, good quality but the drivel that they write
in there really takes the piss.


Console Copiers?

- Essential. The  fact,  though,  that  hardly  anyone  copies console
games, companies sell millions and they are still œ50 a shot goes to
show that piracy has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do with high software
prices.



The PC & the PC scene?

- Now with things like local bus GFX cards & 16Bit sound cards the PC
is looking sexierthan ever but  its  popularity  has unfortunately
attracted everyone who used to have an Amiga.  By this I don't mean
all the ex Amiga crews  (I  could live with that  - just about) but
instead the sad, foul,lying little shits, who must have a computer
thats 'trendy'.



The A1200 & CD32? (Swearing is allowed in Maggie)

- While the  A1200  &  the  CD32  are  the  same  system I regard them
differently. The A1200 really isn't a 32bit machine and isn't really
any better than a normal Amiga but it is a good value home computer,
and is really the only choice is you can't afford a PC.

The CD32 on the other claims to  be a state of the art 32bit console
but is really completely shit and just an attempt by Commodore to make
some money by deceiving the ludicrously gullible  Amiga buyer who is
still at large. Even the Megadrive and SNES are better than the CD32.
Some of the 3D games on the MegaCD make the CD32 look very sad indeed.


The 3D0?

- Not up to scratch really, buy a Jaguar instead.


Spring '94 ECTS?

- Loads of great   Console  and  PC  stuff  (Inferno looks absoulutely
unreal), the 3D0 was  looking very  much CD-I  'ish  but some of the
Jaguar stuff was great - Aliens Vs Predator particularly.From what I
could see the games that were on show were Aliens Vs Predator,Tempest
2000, Kasumi Ninja, Wolfenstein 3D, and Flashback. There was another
game there with a big crowd round the  machine so you couldn't but I
think it may have been Chequered Flag II.


And for the future perhaps?

The Falcon 040?

- But who would buy it??



A Jaguar computer?

- Thats the one I'm waiting for.


Sony PS-X?

- Consumer electronics companies are simply no good at making decent
computers or consoles. It may sound  good now but when it appears in
two or three years it won't be.Sony also claim that you will be able
to play arcade perfect Ridge Racer on their system - I don't think so
Sony.

Project Reality?

- Silicon  graphics can't  make  a  decent  workstation for much under
œ20k so for a few hundred dollars I wouldn't expect much.

Sega Saturn?

- Sega have a lot better past record than Sony or Nintendo in coming
up with the goods but the fact that the  MegaCD was a bit crap is an
indication that the Saturn may most likely not be very good either.I
would predict that the Saturn will be a bit better than the Jaguar 
butprobably a lot dearer than the Jaguar as well.
