Foreword
--------
Computers are often renowned for being expensive 'toys' which, more
often than not, eat into what precious little money we have.  That is
where Pennies From Heaven (PFH) comes into play.  This is essentially
a listing of the best pieces of software\hardware you can buy for
your Atari for either under a pound, under five pounds or under ten
pounds.  Plus a few little ideas you may have not even thought about
before!*******


Disclaimer
----------
All prices quoted are correct at time of compilation and are subject
to change at the suppliers discretion.  All prices are inclusive of
VAT but there may be postal charges on some of the items included. 
It is always best to phone before ordering to check prices are still
in effect.  A complete directory listing of the company addresses and
contact numbers is at the end of this document along with an index to
the bargains we have found.

The companies selected are not massive corporate ones aimed at bulk
buyers, all will treat you with just as much care and concern if you
order a mouse mat as if you had ordered a complete computer system.
Please note that where a description is in "quotes" it means the text
has been taken directly from either an advertisement or brochure put
out by the company and it not strictly the opinions viewed by the PFH
staff.  We are in no way responsible if a company fails to fulfil
their service, where possible always phone them and check on the
prices and availability of the product you wish to order, it could
save a few tears in the long run.  If you do encounter a bad
reception from a company listed here then please let us know so we
can make amendments for the next update of PFH.  Thank you.


Simple Guide to using this document

Should you find something you like the sound of the in the INDEX then
you will notice a special code before the item name, ie

[T022] FALCON VGA ADAPTOR

This can also be used in a search facility, simply search for the
[T022] string and you will soon find the item described with full
details of the supplier and price.  We hope this system of keywords
allows you to use this document to its fullest, if you have any
suggestions then please contact us.


Updates
-------
As you can appreciate this kind of document is very liable to change
and we are planning to release constant updates.  They will be
released onto the bulletin boards first and to a few key public
domain libraries.  To ensure you receive an update to PFH simply send
us a blank double sided double density disk, PRE-FORMATTED to Atari
ST standard and a STAMPED self-addressed envelope to the following
address.  If you fail to include the stamp or disk you'll hear
nothing from us.

  PFH, Dept. FOG, 10 Oak Drive, Portishead, Bristol, BS20 8QS.

Alternatively we can Email you the list if you have Internet access,
just drop me a line requesting the latest PFH Update.

  Internet: CM3HIRJD%BS41.DNET.AC.UK@STAFFS.AC.UK

Alternatively just contact any of the PD libraries listed in this
update.  We are not sure how often PFH is to be updated, I guess it
depends on how many more bargains we can find!  If you run a PD
library or any company that provides either a service or products to
the Atari community and feel you ought to be featured in here just
send a detailed description of your products and price to the above
address, or Email it to me.  PD Libraries who publish disk catalogues
are welcome to send them for evaluation and a free mention, we will
use their contents (with your permission only) if we find anything of
interest for our readers.


Free Software
-------------
Because we are the nice generous people we are, if you enclose some
public domain software on the disk you send us for updating, we shall
return to you our latest update AND a wide, compressed, selection of
the current top public domain and shareware titles.  These titles
will often vary but are always the best we can find.  Please state ST
or Falcon.  We have possibly the largest range of Falcon PD available
in the world, just say if you would like a listing.
€

The End Bit
-----------
From all at PFH, happy bargain hunting and see you again soon in our
next update.  Remember if you spot something for better value, we
want to know about it!!

[V036] ATARI ST REVIEW MAGAZINE
œ3.50p from most news agents
This monthly publication is probably the best available for the
Atari.  The editorial is concise and very well written, the content
varied and interesting with sufficient screen shots and detail to
persuade the most ardent reader.  With a leaning towards the
applications software world, although never overlooking the new
games, and the best PD section of any magazine I've seen, you can't
really go far wrong here.  Cover disks are often varied and
interesting.  Published by Europress.  Average page count - 100.

[V037] ATARI ST USER MAGAZINE
œ3.60p from most news agents
Why you pay the extra 10 pence over Atari ST Review I don't
understand, especially when you consider you get less for your money.
 The topics covered seem always to be old hat and their tutorials
leave much to be desired.  However there is a strong feel of
stability within the pages and the Aspects section could do with
serious expansion as they are very well written indeed.  ST Action is
also incorporated into ST User although blink and you'll probably
miss it, current issues have had too much Jaguar coverage.  One major
gripe is the layout of the magazine, often quite ugly in appearance. 
The cover disk is sometimes rewarding but has also been home to
several turkeys, but things have looked up recently with some class
free software including demos of DA's Vector, ProText 6 and more. 
The PD section leaves a LOT to be desired and is, in my opinion, the
worse aspect of this magazine.  Average page count - 90.

[V038] ST FORMAT MAGAZINE
œ3.25p from most news agents
Still trying hard to shrug off a glitzy games image this publication
is still one of the better reads for ST users.  It is unique in that
it will appeal to a much wider audience and covers all aspects
equally.  The cover disks are simply the best, no doubt about it, and
are always intelligently compiled with high quality and interesting
pieces of software.  They have also been home to many a commercial
package, indeed it was Future Publishing who started this trend a few
years back, and it still thrives on today.  Extremely well designed
and presented all the information is where you need it, and credit
must go the the artists who make up the pages, the screen shots are
always clear and the layout imaginative and exciting.  They could do
with giving more serious thought to the band of users who wish to
€gain more from their machine and produce some higher level articles
and tutorials to cater for them.  Articles are well written and
mostly in-depth enough, although not always.  The PD section is great
by the way!  A strong runner which is also suffering from a page
diet, once the adverts have been removed.  Average page count - 105.

[V039] THE DTP PAPER SELECTOR
œ4.95p from World of Paper
Is your laser paper boring?  "We offer the colours and textures to
turn good ideas into big results.  World of Paper is the complete
direct paper source for all office, laser, inkjet, desktop and
promotional needs!  The exclusive A4 DTP Selector contains dozens of
samples sheets to choose from - even fluorescent!".

[V040] 10 BRANDED 3.5" DISKS
œ4.50p from Computer Mates
2 for 1 lifetime warranty - quality without the frills!

[V041] 25 CAPACITY 3.5" DISK BOX
œ3.00p from Computer Mates
A nice sturdy box to hold those precious disks in, 25 may seem an odd
number but at this price its better than leaving your disks laying on
the floor\bench!

[V042] 5 CAPACITY 3.5" DISK BOX
œ1.15p from Computer Mates
Perhaps you want to securely post some disks or simply take them to
work\school.  This is the perfect cheap option.

[V043] 12" FILTER SCREEN
œ2.95p from Computer Mates
Reduce any glare you may get from your monitor with this cheap

now!

[T064] STE UPGRADE
œ9.99p from Go Direct
Get that 'E' upgraded now with the best kit available.  Full
instructions provided.

[T065] ST BASIC
œ5.99p from First Computer Centre
The original basic language for the Atari ST.  Good starting place
but there are better ones out there, a bargain for 6 quid though!!

[T066] UNIVERSAL PRINTER STAND
œ6.80p from First Computer Centre
A stand for your printer and a place for the paper to go, very useful
devices indeed.

[T067] 3 METRE PRINTER CABLE
œ5.95p from First Computer Centre
Long enough cable to connect the ST and its printer for most people.

[T068] 5 METRE PRINT CABLE
œ7.65p from First Computer Centre
VERY long cable indeed!  Useful if your printer is located a few feet
away I suppose!  (there is a 10 metre cable but its over 10 pounds!).

[T069] STE PRIMA RAM EXPANSION
œ9.99p from First Computer Centre
Comes with 2 year guarantee and uses SIMM boards so just add this and
away you go.

[T070] GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN IT
œ9.95p from Go Direct
A great book by Nic Mansfield.  "Do you ever see initials in place of
words and wonder what they mean?  If so, this book is for you.  While
not ST-specific, all commonly-used information technology acronyms
are explained.".

[T071] THE MIDI SURVIVAL GUIDE
œ6.95p from Go Direct
By Vic Lennard.  "Want to get started in music on the ST?  Here's the
perfect book for you, written by Vic Lennard, editor of ST Review. 
It's filled with over 40 informative diagrams of how to set-up a MIDI
system, and written in a friendly down to earth manner.
