For issue 14 of Maggie we'd like to interview some of the people still
left on the ST scene to find out whether there is truly an ST scene
left to talk of and what the future holds for the Atari scene.

I've tried to include most  relevant  and  some  crap questions but if
there is anything you want to, add or any questions that you'd like to
be asked please feel free to add them.


What handle are you currently using?
ABSU

What groups/affiliations are you currently a member of?
CYNIX

How old are you?
24

What are your favourite games of all time?
TOP 10 ST GAMES (IN NO SPECIAL ORDER):
STUNT CAR RACER,  FALCON,  WINGS  OF  DEATH  II,  GAUNTLET  II, HELTER
SKELTER, OPERATION STEALTH, SUPER HANG ON, XENON II, PIRATES AND VROOM

Worst games of all time?
PROBABLY TOP BANANA, BUT THERE ARE  MANY,  MANY MORE THAT ARE PROBABLY
EVEN WORSE.

Best films of all time? - Sorry no obscure horror films allowed!!!!
TOP 10  FILMS  (IN  NO  SPECIAL  ORDER,  INCLUDING  A FEW SEMI-OBSCURE
HORROR FILMS): TENEBRAE,  SUSPIRIA,  CANNIBAL  HOLOCAUST,  THE KILLER,
BULLET IN THE HEAD, RESERVOIR DOGS, MAN BITES DOG, PREDATOR, THE GOOD,
THE BAD & THE UGLY, APOCALYPSE NOW.
MY ULTIMATE FILM HAS  YET TO BE MADE.... BUT WILL BE DIRECTED BY DARIO
ARGENTO AND JOHN WOO!!

Worst films?
TOO MANY  SHITTY, OBSURE HORROR FILMS  TO MENTION. THE WORST FILM I'VE
SEEN IN THE  CINEMA  RECENTLY  IS  DEFINITELY  SLIVER.  OF  COURSE, IT
DOESN'T COST ANY MORE TO MAKE A GOOD  FILM  THAN TO MAKE A BAD ONE, SO
IT'S ANNOYING WHEN  YOU  THINK  THAT  EVERY  CRAP  FILM  WAS  A WASTED
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A REALLY GREAT ONE.

Your favourite TV progs?
NOT MUCH, PROBABLY SOME OF THE COMEDY PROGS.

Worst TV progs?
MOST OF THE MINDLESS,  INACCURATE, BULLSHIT THAT'S CHEAPLY CHURNED OUT
AND GRATEFULLY LAPPED UP!

Favourite ST groups?
MY FAVOURITE  GROUP WAS ALWAYS  THE  REPLICANTS.  IN MY OPINION (AND I
SHOULD KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT!)  THEY  HAD  SOME  OF THE BEST ST
CRACKERS OF ALL TIME (DOM,  R.AL,  SNAKE  ETC), AND ALWAYS DID DECENT,
100% CRACKS.  THEY  HAD  FAST  ORIGINAL  SUPPLIERS  AND  MODEM TRADERS
(SOMETHING EVERY GOOD  GROUP  NEEDS),  AND  SET  STANDARDS  IN HACKING
RATHER THAN JUST FOLLOWING LIKE MOST OTHER GROUPS.

Least favourite ST groups?
EVERYONE MAKES A  CONTRIBUTION   NO  MATTER  WHAT  LEVEL  IT'S ON, BUT
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE  DOING AND RELEASE FUCKED UP HACKS
(OR WORSE, FUCK UP SOMEONE ELSES WORK WHEN  THEY PUT IT ON A MENU), OR
JUST RELEASE ANY OLD BOLLOX SIMPLY TO  STICK AN INTRO ON THE FRONT END
SLAGGING PEOPLE OFF WERE ALWAYS JUST A WASTE OF TIME AND SPACE.

What is your function in CyniX?
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING/EVERYTHING.

Why do you crack, do you enjoy it or do you enjoy the status it gives?
WHAT STATUS? WHY DO YOU  THINK WE ALL USE PSEUDONYMS! ANYWAY, I'VE MET
AND TALKED TO MORE  ARSEHOLES  THROUGH  THE  ST  SCENE  THAN YOU WOULD
BELIEVE! THE FUN IS IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF BREAKING THE PROTECTION, AND
COMPETING WITH OTHER GUYS WITH THE SAME SKILL TO SEE WHO CAN CRACK THE
BEST/LATEST  PROTECTION  TECHNNIQUES!  MOST   GAMES   HAVE  VERY  POOR
PROTECTION ANYWAY, BUT THE REAL CHALLENGE STARTS WHEN A PROGRAMMER HAS
ACTUALLY GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT (S)HE'S DOING, AND
TRYING TO COMBAT THE HACKER!

I'm sure that many companies would rather you didn't crack their games
- How do you justify what you do?
ONCE YOU BUY A GAME YOU SHOULD   BE  ABLE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WANT WITH
IT.... IF YOU CAN GET MORE FUN  FROM  TAKING IT APART AND MODIFYING IT
THAN ACTUALLY PLAYING WITH  IT  THEN  WHY  NOT?  THE  VAST MAJORITY OF
SOFTWARE IS OVER-PRICED CRAP ANYWAY, SO  9  TIMES  OUT OF 10 IT'S MORE
FUN TO CRACK THE GAME THAN  TO  PLAY  IT! MOST PEOPLE WHO SWAP/COLLECT
THE CRACKED GAMES WOULD  NEVER  EVEN  CONSIDER  BUYING THEM ANYWAY (IN
FACT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T EVEN OWN  COMPUTERS  IF THEY HAD NO ACCESS
TO CRACKED GAMES), SO I DON'T THINK CRACKING THE GAMES REALLY HAS MUCH
EFFECT ON SALES. ON THE FEW RARE OCCASIONS WHEN A GENUINELY GOOD TITLE
IS RELEASED IT  ALWAYS  DOES  EXTREMELY  WELL  FINANCIALLY  WHICH JUST
PROVES MY POINT. AS FOR MARKET TRADERS SELLING THE CRACKED GAMES, THEY
WOULD JUST COPY THE ORIGINAL DISKS ANYWAY SO OVERALL I THINK IT HAS A
MORE BENEFICIAL EFFECT TO THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

Are there any circumstances in which you wouldn't crack a game?
IF IT WASN'T WORTH CRACKING,  OR  (MAYBE)  IF I KNEW WHO PROGRAMMED IT
AND THEY ASKED ME NOT TO, OR  PERHAPS A CHARITY GAME OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT.

Who do you think is or was the best cracker on the ST?
THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE... NO-ONE HAS  EVER CRACKED EVERYTHING, OR EVEN
CRACKED EVERY ONE OF THE BEST PROTECTIONS, SO I DON'T THINK ANY SINGLE
PERSON CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE BEST. IF  I HAD TO PICK ONE PERSON THEN
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ONE  OF  THE  FOLLOWING: DOM, R.AL, WAS (NOT WAS),
ZIPPY OR ILLEGAL.

What do you think of FAST?
THEY ARE FIGHTING A  BATTLE  THAT  THEY  CAN  NEVER WIN. HOWEVER, WITH
MEGA-BUCKS SUPPORT OF SOFTWARE  COMPANIES  THEY  WILL PROBABLY ACHIEVE
THE TYPICAL  REACTIONARY  GOVERNMENT  RESPONSE  THEY  WOULD  LIKE. IE.
STRING UP PIRATES 'CAUSE THEY ARE  COSTING  OUR COUNTRY 'X' BILLION IN
LOST SALES!

What is the  hardest protection you've ever come across? Did you crack
it?
THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW REALLY   EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD PROTECTIONS OVER THE
YEARS, SOME OF THE FOLLOWING GAMES  COME  TO MIND: MAUPITI ISLAND, WAR
HELI, PARASOL STARS, PIRATES,  TOKI,  GIANNA  SISTERS, DUNGEON MASTER,
ROBOCOP 3, FUTURE WARS,  OPERATION  STEALTH,  MONKEY ISLAND, LOOM ETC.
THE LAST FEW WERE NOT REALLY  INTENTIONALLY DIFFICULT BUT BECAUSE THEY
WERE WRITTEN IN A  HIGH  LEVEL  LANGUAGE  THEY  WERE  SOME OF THE MOST
AWKWARD TO HACK. I MANAGED TO DO  ALL  THE ONES THAT I REALLY TRIED TO
DO, BUT THANKFULLY NEVER HAD TO TACKLE A COUPLE OF THEM AS THEY WERE A
BIT BEFORE MY TIME, THOUGH I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY WOULD OF BEEN ANY MORE
DIFFICULT THAN MOST OF THE  LATER  ONES  ANYWAY. ANY PROTECTION SYSTEM
CAN BE CRACKED, IT'S JUST A  QUESTION  OF  HOW  LONG IT WILL TAKE, AND
WHAT 'TOOLS' ARE REQUIRED TO SPEED THINGS UP.

How long have you been on the ST scene?
I FIRST SAW/USED AN  ST  IN  1987.  THE  FIRST   GAME  I  EVER SAW WAS
DEFENDER OF THE CROWN, AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF SEEING THAT I'D SOLD
MY BBC MICRO AND GOT  THE  'SUMMER  PACK'  WITH  A FEW FREE GAMES! THE
FIRST GAME I EVER CRACKED WAS 'EMPIRE' 'CAUSE A FEW FRIENDS HAD BOUGHT
THE ORIGINAL AND  THE  MANUAL  DID  NOT  MATCH  UP  WITH  THE PASSWORD
PROTECTION CHECK, SO THE  ORIGINAL  GAME  HAD  TO  BE HACKED BEFORE IT
COULD EVEN BE PLAYED!

What have you enjoyed most about the ST & the ST scene?
MEETING SOME OF THE CHARACTERS,  PLAYING  A FEW OF THE GAMES, LEARNING
A LOT ABOUT HACKING  AND  CODING  AND  MOST  OF  ALL  NOT HAVING TO BE
INVOLVED IN THE AMIGA SCENE.

There are some rumours (unfounded I'm sure) that you've used more
than one handle during your time on the ST?  Could this possibly
be true?
COULD BE.... A FEW NAMES  THAT  COME  TO  MIND ARE MIGHTY CLOG, ZIPPY,
OBMAR, TRAUMA X, PAZUZU,  MILKY  BAR  KID,  ABSU  PLUS  PROBABLY A FEW
OTHERS THAT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER RIGHT NOW.

Would you consider yourself as still being active on the ST scene?  If
not what made you give up?  If  yes  then  what  about the good old ST
keeps you going?
I SUPPOSE WE ARE  REALLY INACTIVE UNTIL  A NEW TITLE COMES OUT THEN WE
BECOME ACTIVATED, BLOW THE DUST OFF  OUR ST KEYBOARDS, TRY TO REMEMBER
HOW TO CRACK AND WHAT ALL  THOSE 68000 ASSEMBLER INSTRUCTIONS MEAN AND
WHAT THE HELL SOME OF THAT OLD  SOURCE DOES AS WELL. ONCE WE'VE WORKED
ALL THAT OUT THEN THE  NEW  GAME  JUST  MIGHT GET HACKED AND RELEASED.
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH SELLING YOUR ST  NOW SO WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HACK
ANY NEW RELEASES THAT DO TURN UP OVER  THE NEXT YEAR OR SO, EVEN IF IT
MEANS HAVING TO DIG OUR ST'S OUT OF THE CUPBOARD AND ONLY SETTING THEM
UP FOR A FEW HOURS TO CRACK/RELEASE THE NEW GAME.

With the ST truly in its sunset years what do you see as being the
next machine to have?
THE ONLY OPTIONS FOR NOW   AND  THE  FUTURE  ARE  A CONSOLE FOR ARCADE
GAMES AND A PC FOR EVERYTHING  ELSE.  PC'S  IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM WILL
ALWAYS BE WITH US, AND SO  LONG  AS  CD OR CARTRIDGE COPYING IS VIABLE
THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSOLE WORTH HAVING AS WELL.

If money wasn't a problem what single machine would you buy right now?
PROBABLY A REALLY HIGH  SPEC  PC:   100MHZ  PENTIUM,  10 GIG HD, MEGA-
ACCELERATED VIDEO CARD, 25" MONITOR  ETC.  THOUGH I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO
HAVE FOUR OF THEM ALL LINKED UP FOR DOOM NETWORK PLAY!!!

Who on the ST scene past and present do you respect?
I RESPECT THOSE  PEOPLE WHO MAKE A WORTH WHILE CONTRIBUTION, NO MATTER
HOW BIG OR SMALL. OF COURSE THE ONES WHO WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED ARE
THOSE THAT MADE REVOLUTIONARY ADVANCES  IN CODING/HACKING LIKE TCB FOR
H/WARE SCROLLING AND THE  MOST  AMAZING  DEMOS,  TEX  AND LEVEL 16 FOR
BORDER  REMOVAL,  MAD  MAX  FOR   THE  BEST  MUSIC,  REPLICANTS/MEDWAY
BOYS/AUTOMATION/MCA/FOF/DELIGHT/HOTLINE/UNION/BLADERUNNERS/42-
CREW/STCS/007/TSUNOO RHILTY FOR THE  BEST  HACKS,  AND  FOR MAKING THE
WHOLE ST SCENE WHAT IT WAS.

Who on the ST scene past and present do you not respect?
PEOPLE WHO WERE ARESHOLES LONG  BEFORE  THEY BECAME INVOLVED IN THE ST
SCENE!

The Falcon is  undoubtedly an accomplished  machine but do you believe
it really has the ability to compete as a medium market home computer?
NO... IT'S JUST ANOTHER ARCHIMEDES (ONLY NOT EVEN SO SUCESSFUL!).
THE ARC  WAS THE BEST MACHINE OF  IT'S TIME.... AND STILL HAS THE BEST
GUI I'VE SEEN ON ANY MACHINE,  JUST  A  SHAME IT WASN'T HALF THE PRICE
AND MARKETED BY NINTENDO OR SEGA! THE  FAILURE OF THE FALCON (AND ARC)
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE AGE OF THE HOME  COMPUTER IS OVER.... IF IT'S NOT
A CONSOLE OR PC THEN FORGET IT.

What do you think 1994 holds in store for the Atari scene?
NOT A LOT... MAYBE A FEW  NEW  RELEASES,  AND  HOPEFULLY A FEW NEW (OR
OLD) NAMES MAY MAKE AN APPEARANCE. MAYBE  THE JAGUAR WILL TAKE OFF BUT
IT WILL NEVER BE A REPLACEMENT FOR THE OLD ST SCENE.

What would you most like to happen for Atari in the future?
I HOPE THE  JAGUAR IS REALLY  SUCCESSFUL,  'CAUSE IT REALLY IS MAKE OR
BREAK TIME FOR ATARI.... BUT FROM WHAT  I'VE  SEEN SO FAR THEY ARE NOT
TAKING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE  SERIOUSLY  ENOUGH  TO BE A GENUINE
CONTENDER IN THE CONSOLE MARKET.

At the end of 1992 we all thought (well nearly all of us anyway) that
the Falcon was going to be the next big thing, an ST for the nineties.
Over a year later it seems to have made a slightly smaller impression -
what do you think went wrong?
A NUMBER OF THINGS  WENT WRONG  OR  WERE OVERLOOKED BY ATARI. WHEN THE
ST AND AMIGA WERE RELEASED THERE WAS NO OTHER COMPETITION AND EVERYONE
WANTED TO UPDATE THEIR 8 BIT  HOME  COMPUTERS, BUT WHEN THE FALCON WAS
RELEASED NO ONE HAD REALISED HOW  MUCH  THE  PC  HAD TAKEN OVER AND SO
THERE WAS REALLY VERY LITTLE DEMAND FOR  A MACHINE LIKE THE FALCON, AS
WAS ALSO THE CASE WITH THE ARCHIMEDES. IF IT HAD BEEN A LOT CHEAPER IT
WOULD OF BEEN A REPLACEMENT FOR  ST'S  AND AMIGA'S, BUT WITH IT PRICED
SO HIGHLY IT WAS COMPETING  WITH  HIGH-SPEC  PC'S, AND VERY FEW PEOPLE
WOULD BUY A NEW MACHINE WITH NO SOFTWAREBACKUP IN PREFERENCE TO A PC.

Up until present Atari has certainly marketed the Jaguar very well with
a lot of media coverage being given to its unsurpassed capabilities,
but do you really think they (Atari) have what it takes to make it
successful?
PROBABLY NOT... THE CAPABILITIES OF  THE  JAGUAR ARE (LIKE THE FALCON)
NOT ALL THEY ARE HYPED  UP  TO  BE.  JUST  BECAUSE  IT'S  GOT A 64 BIT
PROCESSOR EVERYONE THINKS IT IS  MEGA-POWERFUL,  BUT  WHEN IT COMES TO
GAMES CONSOLES THE CUSTOM PROCESSORS  FOR SPRITES, HARDWARE SCROLLING,
POLYGON PLOTTING, TEXTURE MAPPING, DSP  FOR  SOUND  ETC ARE A LOT MORE
IMPORTANT (LOOK AT THE SNES WITH  AN UNBELIEVABLY SHITTY PROCESSOR BUT
SOME REALLY GREAT GAMES 'CAUSE OF THE CUSTOM CHIPS!). YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A REALLY POWERFUL PROCESSOR TO  SIMULATE  IN  SOFTWARE WHAT THE CUSTOM
CHIPS DO IN HARDWARE (LIKE DOOM ON  A  66MHZ LOCAL BUS VIDEO PC!), AND
I'M YET TO BE CONVINCED THAT  THE  JAGUAR IS A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE STEP
FORWARD TO BEAT WHAT SEGA, NINTENDO AND SONY HAVE IN THE PIPELINE. THE
CURRENT CONSOLES CAN ALREADY HAVE  LOADS  OF PARALLAX SCROLLING LAYERS
WITH LOADS OF SPRITES ON SCREEN, SO  IF  THE JAGUAR IS TO BE A SUCCESS
IT HAS TO OFFER SOMETHING MORE  THAN THE CURRENT MACHINES... LIKE FAST
3D GAMES, AND WITHOUT HARDWARE TEXTURE MAPPING AND POLYGON PLOTTING IS
IT JUST GOING TO BE A 64 BIT NEO-GEO?


What do you think of:-

The Falcon 030?
I'D RATHER HAVE ANOTHER ARCHIMEDES WITH ARM 3!
„(Andsomedecenttruecolourand16-bitsoundperhaps??-ED)€

The Atari Lynx?
REALLY NICE LITTLE  MACHINE,  BUT  AS  USUAL  WITH  ATARI: NO SOFTWARE
SUPPORT TOTALLY KILLED IT (JAGUAR TAKE NOTE!)

The Jaguar?
ATARI HAVE  TO  GET  THE  BALL  ROLLING  BY  DEVELOPING  SOFTWARE THAT
STRETCHES THE MACHINE'S CAPABILITIES. NO ONE WILL BUY THE MACHINE, AND
THEREFORE NO THIRD PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL  WANT TO PRODUCE GAMES FOR IT
UNLESS  SOMEONE  MAKES  THE  FIRST  MOVE   AND  THIS  HAS  TO  BE  THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF ATARI, EITHER IN-HOUSE,  OR  BY CONTRACTING TO THIRD
PARTIES.

The Jaguar CD-ROM?
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT WILL PROBABLY JUST BE ANOTHER CD-32!
WOULD BE OK IF IT COULD ALSO PLAY CD-FILMS THOUGH.
NOBODY HAS EVEN MADE A  DECENT CARTRIDGE  GAME FOR IT YET SO LET'S NOT
BE TOO HOPEFUL ABOUT THE CD BASED GAMES!

Console copiers?
AN ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL,  AS  WE  ALL  KNOW  WHAT  A  NASTY HABIT BUYING
ORIGINALS IS, DON'T WE?

The PC & the PC scene?
SHAME ABOUT THE  PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE, BUT  IT'S THE ONLY MACHINE TO
HAVE AT THE MOMENT.

Apple MAC?
THE ONLY  MACHINE THAT DOESN'T  HAVE  A  SCENE.... THAT REALLY SAYS IT
ALL!

The A1200 & CD32? (Swearing is allowed in maggie)
A LAST  ATTEMPT BY COMMODORE  TO  SAVE  THE SINKING AMIGA. TOO LITTLE,
TOO LATE THOUGH I THINK!

The 3D0?
LOOKED GOOD  AT FIRST, BUT AS USUAL THE SOFTWARE SIDE OF THINGS LET IT
DOWN. USEFUL FOR PLAYING CD-FILMS  ON  THOUGH (EVEN THOUGH THE QUALITY
OF LASER DISC IS FAR SUPERIOR!).

Fat pie eating bastards?
A SLICE OF PIE COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH?!

CD-R?
COULD BE THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE PIRACY, AND MAYBE EVEN CONSOLE PIRACY!

Maggie?
THE BEST (ONLY?) ST DISK MAG!

€
SlimFast delicious shakes?
GOOD TO WASH DOWN A FEW POUNDS OF LARD!

And for the future perhaps?

The Falcon 040?
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE (AGAIN).

A Jaguar computer?
WOULD BE GREAT FOR DEMOS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

New consoles?
IF THE SOFTWARE CAN MATCH UP TO THE HARDWARE THEN THERE COULD BE SOME
AMAZING THINGS TO COME.
