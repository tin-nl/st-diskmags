 HI CHRIS:

 THIS IS THE LATEST ARTICLE.

 THE COST:

WE ARE AT A VERY STRANGE  STAGE  OF COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT.  TO MY MIND,
WE ARE AT A STAGE EQUIVALENT  TO  THE DISCOVERY OF ELECTRICITY ITSELF.
WHEN THE PHENOMENON WAS FIRST OBSERVED, IT  WAS NO MORE THAN A PARLOUR
TRICK.  A VAN DER GRAF GENERATOR  TO  AMUSE GUESTS AT PARTIES WAS THE
LIMIT OF THE SERIOUS SCIENTIST.  IT TOOK THE INVENTION OF A USE FOR IT
TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED.

WITH COMPUTERS, WE ARE AT AN  ODD  STAGE WHERE THE PHENOMENON HAS BEEN
INVENTED, AND  IS  BEING  POPULARISED,  BUT  STILL  LACKS  THAT  VITAL
BREAKTHROUGH.  MERELY BY READING  THIS  ARTICLE  YOU ARE IDENTIFIED AS
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY'S EQUIVALENT  OF  THE  AMATEUR SCIENTIST FOOLING
WITH ELECTRICITY,  BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT?  YOU WRITE WITH IT AS I
AM DOING TO YOU AT THIS MOMENT,  YOU DRAW WITH IT AND IT GIVES YOU THE
TOOLS TO MAKE UP FOR YOUR ARTISTIC INADEQUACIES, AND YOU NUMBER CRUNCH
WITH IT TO SORT OUT YOUR FINANCES.   AT A BUSINESS LEVEL, THE WORLD IS
COMPUTERISED.  BUT THAT MARKET AT LEAST IN THE WESTERN WORLD IS ALMOST
SATURATED.  RECENTLY PC MAGAZINES  HAVE  CARRIED  ARTICLES ABOUT SoHo,
STANDING FOR SMALL OFFICE, HOME  OFFICE.   THE  INTENTION IS TO BRIDGE
THE OFFICE MARKET, AND ESTABLISH  THE  HOME ENVIRONMENT AS A COMPUTING
PLATFORM, APPARENTLY WITH THE SAME SOFTWARE, BUT WHY?

OBVIOUSLY A SATURATED BUSINESS MARKET ONLY  NEED TO BUYS UPGRADES, AND
EVEN WITH NEW CHIPS BEING  DEVELOPED,  INDUSTRIALISTS ARE NOT GOING TO
JUNK EVERYTHING EVERY THREE YEARS AS THEY  USED TO DO, BECAUSE THE KIT
IS NOW SO SOPHISTICATED THAT IT ALREADY  DOES  ALL WE ASK OF IT!  OKAY
IT DOESN'T DO 3D REALTIME GRAPHICS LIKE I WANT, OR HEAVY MORPHING LIKE
YOU MAY DESIRE, BUT FOR PLAIN JOE AT WORK, IT HUMS FINE.

SO THE TASK OF THE ADVERTISERS IS  TO  MOULD US TO USE THESE COMPUTERS
AT HOME, TO BUY  ONE,  AND  THEREFORE  BROADEN  THE  MARKET FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS.  BUT HOW MUCH DOES IT COST  TO BUY INTO THIS SoHo WORLD?
A LOT MORE THAN THE 'œ899 AND  LESS!' CLAIMED BY THE MANUFACTURERS.  I
AM WRITING THIS ON œ1600 OF KIT,  A LOT MORE THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD BE
SPENDING FIVE YEARS AGO!  MANY  PEOPLE  HAVE  SHOT CLIVE SINCLAIR WITH
THE LEAD OF SARCASM, BUT HE HAD THE DREAM TO MAKE COMPUTING AFFORDABLE
AND USEABLE AT LEAST.

WE ARE ALL POSSESSORS OF KIT FAR IN EXCESS OF ITS USE TO US,  WE WRITE
A FEW LETTERS USUALLY, FIDDLE WITH  A  FEW  BITMAPS, AND THESE ARE NOT
THE USES TO WHICH WE INTENDED  TO  PUT  THE MACHINE.  WE ALL HAD GRAND
DREAMS OF WRITING WAR  AND  PEACE,  BALANCING  THE  FAMILY BUDGET, AND
PLANNING OUR NEW GARDEN, BUT WHAT  WE  END  UP DOING IS WRITING SORDID
LETTERS AND NOTES TO EACH OTHER. HOW MANY AMIGA (AND ST) OWNERS GAINED
THEIR MACHINES FOR PROGRAMMING, AND NOW JUST SWAP GAMES?  WE ARE BEING
CONNED.  I MIGHT DISTANCE  MYSELF  FROM  THAT  STATEMENT  AS  I USE MY
COMPUTER TO ITS UTMOST,  BUT I SPEAK  FOR FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED
TO BUY KIT TO KEEP UP, AND  HAVE  SPENT THOUSANDS TO STAY AHEAD OF THE
TECHNOLOGY RACE AND SIMPLY USE IT TO COMPLETE SIMPLE, MUNDANE TASKS IN
A WHIZZ BANG WAY.

MY FRIEND RECENTLY STARTED  AN  OPEN  UNIVERSITY COURSE IN MANAGEMENT.
AMONG THE  COURSE  REQUIREMENTS  ARE  A  COMPUTER  CAPABLE  OF RUNNING
MICROSOFT WORKS.  IT HAS COST HER  œ1700  TO  BUY THE KIT,  AND SHE IS
NOT BEING TAUGHT HOW TO  USE  IT  BY  THE  COURSE,  IT  IS A KNEE JERK
RESPONSE TO THE NEED  FOR  I.T  TRAINING  TO  GET COURSE MEMBERS USING
COMPUTERS IN A  'CONSTRUCTIVE  MANNER.'   SHE  HAS  DONE  SOME LETTERS
HERSELF, BUT SHE SPENT HOURS WORKING IT  OUT,  AND SHE IS NOT THE ONLY
ONE.

WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR THE  FUTURE,   WE DROOLED WHEN THE APPLE NEWTON
APPEARED,  AND WE WILL DROOL  NEXT  YEAR  WHEN THE N.B.T ARRIVES (NEXT
BIG THING!)  BUT I  DOUBT  IT  WILL  BE  AN IMPROVEMENT!  COMPUTING IS
GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE, NOT LESS, AND WE ARE PAYING THE PRICE.  I FEEL
THAT THE SoHo PHENOMENON COULD NOT HAVE ARRIVED WITHOUT THE RECESSION.
PEOPLE GO ON COURSES, BUY KIT THE SAME  AS WHAT THEY HAVE AT WORK AS A
BUFFER AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT. REMEMBER THE  MID 80'S WHEN EVERYBODY WHO
WANTED TO CHANGE CAREERS WANTED  TO  GO INTO COMPUTING!  NOW EVERYBODY
WHO WANTS TO KEEP THEIR CAREER  IS  SPENDING  THEIR OWN TIME AND MONEY
BECOMING COMPUTER EXPERTS.  AND  TO  JUSTIFY  OURSELVES, WE TALK ABOUT
THAT GARDEN PLAN, AND THAT GREAT NOVEL,  AND ALL ALONG WE WRITE NOTES,
SWAP GAMES, AND DRIBBLE AT GLOSSY  PICTURES  OF  THE NEW AND EVEN MORE
EXPENSIVE N.B.T........

I  kNOW  THAT  IN  THIS  DECADE,  WE  WILL  HAVE  REASONABLY  POWERFUL
COMPUTERS,  JUST COMBINE A VIDEOPHONE,  LOCAL PACKET RADIO NETWORKING,
SUPER HIGHWAY, MINUTE SIZED BATTERIES AND  VOICE  INPUT, BUT I CAN SEE
US BUYING MANY BOTCHED PROTOTYPES TO  BE  AHEAD OF THE GAME, AND MAYBE
NEVER QUITE GETTING THERE!   WILL  WE  BE  SIDELINED  AS PC USERS HAVE
BEEN, INTO BUYING PACKAGES AS  POWERFUL  AS  COREL  DRAW, TO WRITE OUR
NAME IN  FANCY LETTERING?   OR  WILL  WE  CONTINUE  TO THE END, FACING
FORWARDS, BLINKERED FIRMLY AGAINST THE CORPORORATE INTEREST AND SEEING
IN OUR MIND  THE  HOLY  GRAIL  OF  THAT  ULTIMATE  AFFORDABLE COMPUTER
HOVERING IN THE DISTANCE...

THIS NEEDS KNOCKING INTO SHAPE! (I know,  I  did  it for you - CIH!) I
WILL SOON BE GETTING A SUPER ANAGRAM  MAKER,  I'LL SEND YOU A FEW GOOD
ONES, UNTIL THEN, HERE'S MY LATEST STUFF!

 AJB.
