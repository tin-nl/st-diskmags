For issue 14 of Maggie we'd like to interview some of the people still
left on the ST scene to find out whether there is truly an ST scene
left to talk of and what the future holds for the Atari scene.


I've tried to include most relevant and some crap questions but if there
is anything you want to, add or any questions that you'd like to be
asked please feel free to add them.



What handle are you currently using?

Skywalker of Cynix / EGB of Sub Humans In Turkey



What groups/affiliations are you currently a member of?

Just Cynix, ex Automation.



How old are you?

27



What are your favourite games of all time?

Kick off 2 / Stunt Car Racer / Rainbow Islands / Asteroids



Worst games of all time?

Count Duckula / Alien Storm / WWF II
All truly excellent examples of ST crap.



Best films of all time?

Aliens / Bladerunner.



Worst films?

The underachievers / Highlander II.



Your favourite TV progs?

Don't watch TV too much!!



Worst TV progs?

As above.



Favourite type of Pie?

Mince.



Favourite ST groups?

Who is left now... Superior / Hotline/MCA.



Least favourite ST groups?

No one group deserves that title... one person might though!!



What is your function in CyniX?

Coder / Cracker / Original supplier / Modem Trader.



Why do you crack, do you enjoy it or do you enjoy the status it gives?

Well, it  used to be for the challenge of breaking the protection, but
that's usually too easy these days.So  now  its just to keep the loyal
ST community supplied with cracks  that  work.  There  even used to be
some competition from Elite / ICS  /  Replicants etc, but now it seems
that there is little point in continuing. It has been 2 months since I
saw a new game for  the  ST!!  Another  reason  for cracking is to let
people play with a game before they  decide to buy it. After all, only
about 5 per cent of games  are  worth buying anyway. I myself probably
have about 80 original games!



I'm sure that many companies would rather you didn't crack their
games- How do you justify what you do?

I believe that a game can be protected succesfully against hackers
long enough that reasonable sales can be achieved. When software
companies spend 10 minutes putting the protection into software,how
long do you think it takes to take out again. About 2 minutes, it
takes longer to write an intro for the game.I have helped with the
protection on a couple of commercial ST games, one of these the
Replicants might remember. It took about three attempts to get it
cracked properly, and the game had to boot from disk B!!

A lot of people have only bought ST's as they knew people who already
had access to lots of software.These people will NEVER buy software
ever, so they can hardly be counted as lost sales.

I could ramble on about the price of software,but now that the
software industry is run by big business with shareholders to support
the prices are never likely to reduce.Compared against PC/console
games the ST/AMIGA games are quite fairly priced.



Are there any circumstances in which you wouldn't crack a game?

YES. If I know who has written it.



Who do you think is or was the best cracker on the ST?

for sheer stubborness not to move into the 20th century, ROB.C /
WAS (Not WAS) / VAPOUR / Hot Knife. For using the worst ST setup
I have ever seen, the worst debugger ever (SID, lets face it
would you use a debugger which does not have binary load or save).
And yet he still managed to crack and pack thousands of games.



What do you think of FAST?

What, Bob and his merry band. Well, they were extremely lame, but
just recently they appear to have got annoyed about the level of
piracy through bulletin boards. As a result of this, nearly all
pirate activity has ceased on UK boards.



What is the hardest protection you've  ever come across? Did you
crackit?

Anything riddled with trace encryption,especially down at address
$8.Even the cartridge doesn't appreciate that much.



I think that Dragonflight by Thalion is still uncracked (gonna send
me it ABSU.Its not like any new software is coming out) but its got
to be done sometime. It will just take time, lots of it!!



How long have you been on the ST scene?

Uummm, good question... about 7-8 years now.



Why did you buy a Falcon?

Even better question.How do I get out of this one?It's crap, I don't
know why I bought it, there are no decent games at all.Jeff Minters
Llamazap is one of the worst pieces of softwareI have ever seen.This
machine is too slow,why increase the screen size by a factor of four
from the ST,but only speed up the processor by a factor of two. Nice
graphics modes,Nice direct to disk sampling,no other reasons why you
would want to buy one!!



What have you enjoyed most about the ST & the ST scene?

Meeting the people involved, especially the old  Automation bunch,
Medway Boy, Axe and Jabba from Germany. The  bunch  of nutters in
Liverpool, which for interest is nowhere near where  the crackers
live!! Not even in the same country.



The most memorable occasions were the  Automation  copyparty  in
Middlesborough. Total chaos for a  whole weekend, we  were  all
completely lazy shits until Vaps turned up unexpectedly,the LAW was
sitting writing a new intro which featured a completely blue scroller
(because Vaps had a TV with a knackered blue tube).Everybody started
doing some work at this point  except Neil who  was asleep all the
time!!

Another decent moment  was an Atari show in London where there were
about Twenty people all wandering around with official Automation T-
shirts on. What a laugh, the people on  the  Power computing stand
refused to talk to us(funny considering they sell the Blitz cable
andthe Ultimate Ripper cartridge, rumoured to be written by some
crackers).



Would you consider yourself as still being active on the ST scene?
If not what made you give up? If yes then what about the good old ST
keeps you going?

At the moment,  only just active. I will not sell my ST, so it is
likely that I will continue as long as I can get new software. The
Cynix mailbox received around 160 letters from around the world 
askingfor us to continue, so why not!!



Do you think the Tramiels are a hardnosed business orientated family
or just a bunch of fat foreign tossers  who  wouldn't  know an ad
campaign from a $10million a year loss?

They had made a complete arse of  Atari, up to the point where they
actually delivered the Jaguar. This will likely put  Atari back in
contention with SEGA and Nintendo, as it is available now and it is
better than the competition.The Lynx and the Falcon both flopped due
to poor marketing, shame for the Lynx  because  it was pretty good.
We'll wait and see what happens this year.



With the ST truly in its sunset years what do you see as being the
next machine to have?

If you mean computer,then there is no choice, at the moment the PC
is the only machine worth buying, if you have 1000 pounds to spend.
Otherwise get a Jaguar.It's cool.You can't even copy the software,
but it's still worth buying.


If money wasn't a problem what single  machine  would you buy right
now?

Money isn't a problem,and I would not buy anything at all just now.
I hate PC's and I've had a Unix workstation already.



Who on the ST scene past and present do you respect?

My good friends in the scene,and those mad Scandinavians who seem to
have nothing better to do than code 3D stuff.Is it because its dark
for about half the year!!



Who on the ST scene past and present do you not respect?

Tossers who claim to crack unprotected games,people who swap phone
numbers and menu crews who cannot do anything at all themselves.



The Falcon is undoubtedly an accomplished machine but do you believe
it really has the ability to compete as a mid-market home computer?

What.. Be serious 'Accomplished'. At being a doorstop? It has
no future except in the music market.



What do you think 1994 holds in store for the Atari scene?

Death!!



What would you most like to happen for Atari in the future?

The Jaguar to really succeed.



At the end of 1992 we all thought(well nearly all of us anyway)that
the Falcon was going to be the next big thing,an ST for the nineties.
Over a year later it seems to have made a slightly smaller impression -
what do you think went wrong?

Atari did not market it,which might  not have been a bad idea,since
it would have  been a waste of money. No software companies have
supported it either.It did not stand a chance.



Up until present Atari has certainly marketed the Jaguar very well
with  a  lot  of  media  coverage being given to its  unsurpassed
capabilities,but do you really think they (Atari) have what it takes
to make it successful?

It's either make or break time,and they seem to be making an effort.
As long as decent games keep coming out for it,it will do well.
Cybermorph and Raiden are pretty good for a start.Yes I have played
them!!



What do you think of:-

The Falcon 030?

Covered this already I think, In a single word - Crap.



The Atari Lynx?

Brilliant, worth buying for California Games and Robotron alone.



The Jaguar?

Superb machine,Cybermorph is great,much better than SNES Starwing
much faster, and many more polygons. This is only the start.



The Jaguar CD-ROM?

Who knows!! Does any games company actually know what to do with a
CD-ROM yet. I have yet to see a decent CD-ROM game with gameplay!



Console copiers?

Essential item if you have a SNES or Megadrive. I do not know how
kids can be expected to pay 40-50 pounds for a game.



The PC & the PC scene?

Boring! Have you ever looked at 80X86 assembler, you'll know what I
mean! Where all the Amiga pirates have gone, a  good reason not to
follow.



Apple MAC?

Fruit and Raincoat.... Oh the computer, business only dude!



The A1200 & CD32? (Swearing is allowed in Maggie!)

Well I have an A1200, its OK as long as I program it remotely from
my ST.



The 3D0?

Big expensive piece of Crap... From  what I hear it has extreme
difficulty scrolling the screen... good design guys!



Maggie?

Used to be the best,lack of articles for a while.Drop of enthusiasm
required, this issue is cool of course.
„(The'coolness'factorforthisissuebeingdirectlyrelatedto
theappearanceofthistextfileinit,Isuppose!-ED)
€


And for the future perhaps?

The Falcon 040?

It'll never happen.



A Jaguar computer?

Maybe, but I doubt it.



New consoles?

There will no doubt be new consoles with unbelievable hardware coming
along,but who wants to play Lemmings on a console capable of Ridge
Racer.... someone might take note!! DJ
