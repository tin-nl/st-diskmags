HELLO THERE AND WELCOME  TO  AN  OCCASIONAL  COLUMN  ON THE ARCHIMEDES
RANGE OF COMPUTERS, ARC-I-TECH UNTIL RECENTLY I WAS THE PROUD OWNER OF
A PC PORTABLE OF ANCIENT  LINEAGE  UNTIL  ROBBED  OF  IT ALONG WITH MY
FINAL DEGREE ESSAY, WERE TALKING P******  OFF HERE.  MAY THE ROGUE WHO
TOOK IT HAVE AN ARMY OF  LEPRECHAUNS  WEARING CRAMPONS, CLIMB HIS LEGS
AND BIVOUAC IN HIS TROUSERS WITH THEIR ICE-PICKS....

I START TEACHING IN TWO WEEKS, NOT AS SOME SNOTTY NOSED WORK-SHY NEVER
HAD A JOB BUT DAMN  I'M SMART  KIND  OF  GIT,  BUT AS A MATURE STUDENT
ENTERING THE PROFESSION AFTER A FAST CAREER  IN THE RACY WORLD OF SHOP
DESIGNING. (STIFLE THOSE YAWNS, THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF! )

HAVING LOST MY PC,BUT ABOUT TO GAIN A DECENT INCOME FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN AGES, I HAVE DECIDED TO  BUY  AN ARCHIMEDES COMPUTER.  TWO REASONS,
FIRST AS A TEACHER OF TECHNOLOGY  AND  GRAPHICS, I WILL HAVE ACCESS TO
THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS, AND SECONDLY, WHAT'S  THE USE OF HAVING A COMPUTER
AT HOME DIFFERENT TO THE ONE YOU  USE  AT  WORK IF PART OF YOUR JOB IS
ASSESSING AND MAINTAINING  THE  DEPARTMENTS  EQUIPMENT.  UNFORTUNATELY
THIS DOESN'T ENTITLE ME TO A FREE  MACHINE,  BUT I CAN BORROW THIS ONE
I'M USING FOR THE HOLIDAYS!

SO WHAT IS AN ARCHIMEDES AND IS IT WORTH GETTING?

I MUST SAY THAT IT  IS  ONLY  WORTH  GETTING  IF  YOU NEED THE TYPE OF
PROGRAMS IT CAN DO. DUE TO FIERCE COMPETITION BETWEEN OTHER FORMATS OF
COMPUTERS, THE ARCHIMEDES  IS  NO  LONGER  THE  BEST  'BANGS PER BUCK'
MACHINE IT WAS A YEAR AGO.  TODAY I SAW AN ADVERT FOR A HARD DISC MONO
APPPLE MAC WITH SOFTWARE FOR ú500  INCLUDING  VAT!  YOU CAN BUY AN ARC
FOR THAT, BUT IT WON'T HAVE  A  HARD  DISC  OR EVEN THAT MONO MONITOR!
WHAT YOU WOULD GET FOR  ABOUT  A  THOUSAND,  IS A COLOUR COMPUTER THAT
PRODUCES EXCELLENT GRAPHICS AND HAS A RANGE OF PROGRAMS AVAILABLE THAT
THOUGH LIMITED COMPARED TO THE PC AND  ST, ARE CHEAP, AND ARE DESIGNED
TO BE EASY TO USE!   APART  FROM  HEFTY GRAPHICS APPLICATIONS, THE ARC
HAS ENOUGH POWER TO SPARE  TO  RUN  A WONDERFUL FULLLY WIMP INTERFACE,
AND RUN ANY  PROGRAMS  YOU  NEED  WITHOUT  ANY  OBVIOUS  DISC WAITS OR
GLITCHES.

AT THE MOMENT IT LACKS HEFTY  COLOUR  AS  A STANDARD OPTION, IT CAN DO
256 COLOUR VGA(*) BUT IT'S BETTER AT 16 COLOURS.MIND YOU,YOU PROBABLY
WOULDN'T NOTICE THERE ARE ONLY SIXTEEN  COLOURS  AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO
SWITCH INTO AS MANY SCREEN MODES AS YOU FANCY.
(*)Outofapaletteof4096coloursonlythough-ED)

WHAT SETS THE ARC APART, IS  THAT  ALONG  WITH AN APPLE MAC LIKE WIMP,
THOUGH I FEEL IT IS ACTUALLY  BETTER  AND LESS CLUTTERED AND THAT'S MY
OPINION SO DON'T BUG ME,  IS  THE  INCLUSION  WITH ALL MACHINES OF SET
APPLICATIONS COMPLETE WITH THEIR OWN FILE FORMATS.  THESE APPLICATIONS
ARE CONSTANTLY UPDATED AND MEAN  THAT  FOR  MANY USERS, THEY WILL ONLY
HAVE THE DRAWING OR PAINTING APPLICATION THAT COMES WITH THE COMPUTER.
THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING  THESE  AS  STANDARDS,  IS  THAT IT AVOIDS THE
HORRENDOUS MESS THE PC MARKET HAS  GOT  ITSELF INTO WITH ,FOR EXAMPLE,
GRAPHIC FILE STANDARDS.  THERE ARE  AT  LEAST  36  FILE TYPES THAT ARE
LITERALLY STANDARDS ACCEPTED AND USED.  ONE MAY BE THE MOST COMMON FOR
A PARTICULAR APPLICATION (SUCH AS THE DXF FORMAT FOR CAD PROGRAMS) BUT
THERE WILL STILL BE DOZENS OF  OTHERS  EACH PRODUCED BY A MANUFACTURER
TO GET ROUND  PROGRAMMING  RESTRAINTS  AND  IMPOSE  THEIR OWN PATENTED
COMPATIBILITY.

WITH THE ARC, THERE ARE STILL QUITE A FEW FORMATS, BUT WHERE A WORD
PROCESSOR MIGHT HAVE ITS OWN FORMAT, IT WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE STANDARD
TEXT ONLY FORMAT OF THE EDIT PROGRAM.  AND BECAUSE THERE IS A STANDARD
LINE GRAPHICS FORMAT UNDER  THE  'DRAW'  PROGRAM,IF YOU CAN'T DIRECTLY
TRANSFER DATA BETWEEN ONE PROGRAM AND  ANOTHER,  YOU  CAN SAVE IT AS A
DRAW FILE, AND THEN LOAD IT  INTO  THE  OTHER PROGRAM WHERE IT WILL BE
DEALT WITH USUALLY WITH  NO  GLITCHES.   IN  FACT,  THE  DESKTOP IS SO
FLEXIBLE THAT  YOU  CAN  STOP  WORKING  IN  ONE  WINDOW,  QUICKLY DRAW
SOMETHING IN ANOTHER, GO TO SAVE IT, AND INSTEAD OF SAVING IT TO DISK,
DRAG IT STRAIGHT TO THE  APPLICATION  IN  THE ORIGINAL WINDOW INSTEAD!
NO MORE MULTIPLE DIRECTORIES FOR TINY  GRAPHIC FILES, AND THE PROGRAMS
DON'T HAVE TO  'SEE'  THE  INFORMATION  THEY  ARE  NADE  UP  OF WITHIN
DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES BECAUSE IT IS  CONTAINED WITHIN THE APPLICATIONS
OWN FILETYPE. USERS OF DOS WILL REALISE WHAT A BOON THIS IS AS YOU CAN
'LOSE' INFORMATION BECAUSE THE APPLICATION DOESNT KNOW WHICH DIRECTORY
THE INFO IS IN UNDER DOS.

THE REASON WHY YOU SHOULD BUY AN ARC  ONLY IF YOU WANT THE PROGRAMS IS
THAT  THE  PROGRAMS  ARE  EASY  TO  USE  (AS  THE  BIGGEST  MARKET  IS
EDUCATIONAL) AND CHEAP. ú100 FOR A STAGGERINGLY GOOD CAD PACKAGE.  ú70
FOR A DATABASE.  ú80 FOR  A  SURFACE  MODELLING  PACKAGE.  NOT A GREAT
SAVING ON ST PROGRAMS, BUT  THE  EASE  OF  USE  IS STUNNING.  WHAT YOU
WON'T GET IS CHOICE.   A  STUNNING  DTP  PACKAGE  WILL SELL TO SCHOOLS
WITHIN A YEAR OF LAUNCH, AND THEN THE  SCHOOL WILL STICK WITH IT FOR A
LONG TIME.  PERHAPS ONLY  UPGRADING  THE SOFTWARE OCCASIONALLY.  ALSO,
PROGRAMS TEND TO HAVE A LONG LIFE.  THERE WAS A THREE YEAR GAP BETWEEN
REWRITES FOR A GRAPHICS PROGRAM RECENTLY!

THERE ARE ALSO  PROGRAMS  WHICH  YOU  PROBABLY  WOULDN'T  SEE ON OTHER
MACHINES AT ALL, AT LEAST FOR NOW.   TOPOGRAPHER ALLOWS YOU TO DRAW 2D
MAPS TO SCALE USING THE  FULL  RANGE  OF  BS  SYMBOLS  AND ADD ALL THE
CONTOURS AND ALL THE FEATURES.  IT  WILL THEN TURN A SPECIFIED PORTION
OF THE MAP INTO A 3D VIEW SHOWING IT PRETTY MUCH AS IT WOULD BE IF YOU
WERE STANDING THERE.  THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM AND NEEDS SOME REFINEMENT,
BUT IS THE ONLY APPLICATIOM OF IT'S KIND AVAILABLE. IT ALSO COSTS ONLY
£80.  HOW MUCH WOULD THAT BE AS  A WINDOWS PROGRAM? ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS
TABS, A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS  YOU  TO  DRAW SIMPLE SURFACE MODELS USING
CUBES, CYLINDERS, EXTRUSIONS ETC.  IT WILL  ALLOW FULL EDITING AND ALL
THAT, BUT WILL ALSO PRINT OUT  THE  NETS  OF  THE  OBJECT SO IT CAN BE
FOLDED UP TO MAKE THE REAL  THING!   TRUE, THE HUGE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS
AVAILABLE WITHIN PC APPLICATIONS IS  LACKING,  BUT  WHEN A FRIEND LAST
BOUGHT WORDPERFECT, THE BOX WAS  25  CENTIMETRES  WIDE! AND IT WAS ALL
MANUALS.  WE ARE APPROACHING A POINT WHERE THE AUTHORS COULD LEAVE OFF
FUNCTIONS ON THE PROGRAM BECAUSE  THE  NUMBER  OF PEOPLE USING THEM IS
TINY.

ANOTHER HELPFUL FEATURE IS A  BUILT IN 'SNAPSHOT'FEATURE.  THIS ALLOWS
YOU TO TAKE A PICTURE OF ANY PROGRAM OR THE WHOLE DESKTOP, AND SAVE IT
IN A STANDARD FORMAT.   THIS  MEANS  MAKING  INSTRUCTION  MANUALS IS A
DODDLE AS IT CAN HAVE  LOADS  OF  SCREEN  SHOTS.   I  KNOW YOU CAN BUY
PROGRAMS TO DO THIS  FOR  OTHER  COMPUTERS,  BUT  THE  POINT IS, THESE
FEATURES ARE BUILT IN.  AN EXAMPLE OF  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DESKTOP
IS WIMP FEATURED, IS THE ABILITY  TO  OPEN A MEMORY MANAGEMENT WINDOW,
SEE WHAT'S BEING USED WHERE,  AND  ADJUST  WITH  SLIDERS THE AMOUNT OF
MEMORY USED FOR SCREEN CACHING,  RAM  DISKS,  FONT CACHES ETC.  I HAVE
REPEATEDLY LOST WORK UNDER DOS WHEN IT COULDN'T GET ENOUGH MEMORY...

SO WHY WOULDN'T  YOU LIKE AN ARC,  WELL...  A GOOD ONE COMPLETE WITH A
DECENT MONITOR AND A REASONABLE HARD  DISC  IS ú1200 PLUS, THOUGH THAT
SHOULD GET A MUCH BETTER  MACHINE  BY  CHRISTMAS,   THE QUALITY OF THE
MICE AND KEYBOARDS IS NOT  AS  GOOD AS  YOU'D EXPECT, THOUGH THERE ARE
PLENTY OF THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS, AND YOU SEEM TO BE PAYING THROUGH THE
NOSE SOMETIMES.  AND THE COMPANY IS  A  MONOPOLY AS FAR AS HARDWARE IS
CONCERNED, AND HAS AN  APPLE  LIKE  SUICIDE  STREAK  WHEN  IT COMES TO
CUSTOMER LOYALTY.  PEOPLE HAVE BOUGHT A MACHINE ONE DAY AND DISCOVERED
IT'S PRICE HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY THE NEXT DAY. THERE WILL BE A NEW
MACHINE IN THE AUTUMN, BUT NO-ONE HAS  MUCH  IDEA WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE
TILL THEN.   THE  PRICE  OF  THE  MONITORS  SUPPLIED  AS  STANDARD  IS
STAGGERING, BUT NOT AS BAD AS APPLE'S PRICES.

ON THE GOOD SIDE, IF YOU  HAD  BOUGHT  A  PC FOUR YEARS AGO, YOU WOULD
HAVE A STATE OF THE ART  286  PC  WITH  A 40MB HARD DISC.  TODAY, MOST
PROGRAMS LAUNCHED FOR THE PC WON'T  RUN  ON  THAT AS THEY NEED WINDOWS
RUNNING AT A REASONABLE SPEED. (I KNOW  YOU CAN RUN WINDOWS ON AN 8086
BUT HAVING DONE IT, I'D RATHER  WATCH PAINT  DRY IN SLOW MOTION...) IF
YOU HAD BOUGHT THE LATEST ARC  THEN,  IT WOULD STILL RUN TODAYS LATEST
PROGRAMS AND CAN BE EXPANDED CHEAPLY.  MORE TO THE POINT, IF YOU BUY A
TOP OF THE RANGE ARC TODAY,  YOU  WON'T  HAVE  TO THINK OF CHANGING IT
WHOLESALE FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS, WITH THE RISE OF MULTIMEDIA AND THE
486,PENTIUM,MEGA CHIPS MARCHING ON IN THE PC WORLD, I THINK YOU'D HAVE
A  GOOD  DOORSTOP  IF  YOU  BOUGHT  A  PC  NOW  TO  LAST  FOUR  YEARS.
ACCOUNTANTS WRITE OFF COMPUTERS IN THREE YEARS AND THAT IS LONG ENOUGH
FOR PC'S TO WITHER AND DIE... AND DON'T  GET SMUG IF YOU OWN AN ATARI.
AN ST FM WAS  THE  BEES  KNEES  FOUR  YEARS  AGO  AND  NOW IT'S AGEING
HISTORY.  THIS ARC INERTIA IS  DIRECTLY  LINKED  TO ITS MASSIVE USE IN
EDUCATION. WHILE POST 16 EDUCATION WILL PROBABLY GO PC COMPATIBLE, FOR
THE FUTURE, ARC'S WILL BE THE FORERUNNERS IN SCHOOLS.

CHRIS, HERE'S MY BABY.... COME  UP  AND  SEE  ME SOMETIME...  I'M FREE
MONDAYS SO A WEEKEND SLOT  NEEDN'T  BE  TOO  LIMITING.  I'LL ONLY HAVE
THIS MACHINE FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,  BUT  I  MAY BE ABLE TO BORROW IT
FOR A WEEKEND UNTIL I GET MINE JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS!

P.S HOW MANY AMERICAN ENGINEERS DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A DAM?

ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND IF YOU PACK EM TIGHT!!!!!
