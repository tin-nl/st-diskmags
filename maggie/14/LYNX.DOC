        This is the first of  what  I  hope  will  be a regular Maggie
feature - Lynx news. With the arrival of the Jaguar, the Lynx has been
given a new lease of life  with  Atari consoles once again getting the
respect that they deserve. The first  shops  to be graced with Jaguars
were the ones who loyally sold  Lynxes  over  the last years and Atari
are forcing Lynxes onto prospective Jaguar sellers.

        Also the Lynx is being  extensively advertised in the American
press - two page  colour  adverts  are  prevalent in American computer
games magazines. They compare  the  three  main handheld games systems
and come to  the  inevitable  conclusion  that  the  Lynx 'Kicks their
butts'.

        But if the Lynx is so  good,  how come it isn't dominating the
portable market instead of lagging behind?  To understand this we have
to look into the mists  of  time  (1989)  and the Lynx's evolution. At
this time three portable  games  systems were released simultaneously.
Nintendo released their  8-bit  'no-frills'  Gameboy,  Sega rushed out
their master-system based 'game  gear',  and  Atari  released the Epyx
designed 'Lynx'. All press previews  concluded  that the Lynx's 16-bit
architecture and  dedicated  video  chip  made  it  far  the  superior
machine. Atari even advertised it (not  very extensively, but it was a
start). But the pricing structure was wrong.

        Whilst the gameboy and Gamegear  were hovering around the œ100
price mark, the Lynx's launch  price  was  œ180  -  which was much too
much. Nintendo captured the  'cheap  and  cheerful' market, Sega, with
its TV adaptor, captured another  large  section  of the market. Atari
€initially promised a TV tuner,  then  admitted it would be impossible.
Games were thin on  the  ground.  Still,  it  sold  reasonably well at
first, but Atari quickly lost the momentum to Sega and Nintendo.

        The price of the Lynx came down  to  œ120, and now to œ100 and
there are a  lot  of  titles  available  for  it.  Not  only are Atari
developing games,  but  also  some  third  party  developers  such  as
'Telegames'. Lynxes can be picked up pretty cheap second hand and also
many games can be bought second  hand cheaply. And there are certainly
enough good games for it to merit its purchase.

        As with many Atari  products,  the  Lynx  is technically light
years ahead of its competition. At the  heart of the system is a 8-bit
CPU clocked at about  4mhz.  Not  very  impressive  you may think, but
don't forget this is the same  sort  of  processor speed that the SNES
has. The secret of the Lynx comes with its two custom chips, Micky and
Suzy. The graphics chip can handle  an  amazing amount of sprites, and
it can scale them  and  shift  them  about  the screen with lightening
speed. The sound chip can  handle  4  channels  of sound and play back
some pretty clear samples - unfortunately on  the Lynx One it is mono.
Lucky Lynx Two owners get the  benefits  of  stereo sound (but only in
certain games).

        A bit more about  the  differences  between  the  Lynx One (or
'Lynx Classic' as Atari like  to  call  it)  and its successor. On the
original Lynx it was a pig to  insert and remove carts, especially the
older carts which were completely flat and  you had little to grip on.
The lynx two is much better  designed,  has  stereo sound and a longer
battery life (mainly due to the fact  that you can turn the screen off
if you are pausing the game for  a while). Also the automatic shut off
feature has gone - on the Lynx one  if  you left a game paused for too
long the Lynx would turn itself off to 'conserve power'.

        If you can, buy the Lynx II,  but don't be disappointed with a
Lynx Classic. Don't pay more than œ50  for the unit itself, and try to
look for deals that come with  some  carts.  Also find out if it comes
with a PSU (some are sold without this). The Lynx II doesn't come with
€a comlynx cable, so if you  want  the advantages of multiplayer games,
you will have to invest in one of these.

        As this is the first  Lynx  section,  I  will start by delving
into the archives on my Lynx collection and reviewing the older titles
first - in subsequent issues I will get  on to the newer stuff. If you
are hunting around  second  hand  shops/exchange  shops  you  are more
likely to come across the early titles anyway.

        My ever able sister, a  long  time  Lynx owner (well she's had
one longer than me anyway!) gives  a  valuable second opinion on these
reviews. Before the marks I give an indication of the cart number, the
sound (whether stereo or mono) and the number of players.

BLUE LIGHTNING
==============

This was the first ever Lynx game - and also the first game I saw on a
Lynx (when it was demonstrated at  a  PC  Show  in London, back in the
days when Atari thought it worthwhile to demonstrate at shows...)
It was coded by  Stephen  Landrum  who  wrote  portions  of the Lynx's
operating system, and it is evident  that  he  knows what he is doing.
The moment the cart loads and the  dazzling intro appears you know you
are in for a treat. The game  itself  is an afterburner style shoot em
up - it takes all the  good  things from flight sims (shooting, flying
at ridiculous speeds)  and  dispenses  with  the  boring bits (control
panels, millions of  keys  to  remember).  The  result  is pure arcade
action of the highest  quality.  You  have  nine missions to complete,
they involve flying  over  a  virus-esque  patchwork landscape blowing
away enemy jets  and  ground  targets.  The  combination  of  guns and
missiles which lock-on targets makes combat doubly entertaining.
The landscapes vary from mission to  mission  - on some you are flying
over fields and roads, but you also  get to whizz through a canyon and
fight battleships. During some missions  you  can land on airstrips to
pick up extra fuel.

Graphically the game is a treat,  it  uses the Lynx's graphics chip to
€good effects with planes and missiles whizzing all about the place and
the landscapes beneath you also  move  at  a  fair  pace. The sound is
standard no-frills effects stuff.  The  gameplay however is excellent.
The first two missions  are  relatively  straightforward  but soon you
face a bombardment of enemy  jets,  incoming missiles, bullets, shells
and various  other  life-threatening  projectiles.  The  game  may get
tough, but is completable. The  password  system  helps - when you get
bored with the earlier levels  you  can  just  skip  to the one you're
trying to get past.

This game is a must  for  all  Lynx  owners.  Not  only  is it a great
showpiece for the system but it  plays  great too. What more could you
want?

SECOND SIGHT: (Eddie)

This was one of the first games  I  ever  bought for my lynx and for a
week I played it constantly.  Unfortunately I haven`t really played it
since then because I completed it  in  a very short time.  Nine levels
are just not enough, however  I  must  admit  that mission four had me
stumped for quite a while.   This  was  CANYON  RUN of course, (you`ll
know what I mean when you get to it!) where you have to fly your plane
about 2ft  off  the  ground  and  weave  in  and  out  of  large rocky
outcrops.(no you cannot fly over them!!) I remember nearly chucking my
lynx out of the window when  I  crashed  into the last rock before the
end!  But eventually I got past it  and after I`d completed the game I
went back to canyon run because although  it`s hard, it`s fun!  If you
really want to have some very suicidal fun, hit afterburner and try it
then!!

  Overall this IS a good game,  once  you start playing you can`t stop
and the control you manipulate  makes  it  very addictive.  However if
you know someone who`s got it then try and borrow it off them, (unless
you`re a really crap player!)  instead  of  buying it, because if your
anything like me you`ll complete it in a week or two.

ELECTROCOP
==========

Written by Greg Omi, this  is  a  decent  game.  You are Electrocop, a
supposedly highly futuristic cop (like  Robocop but blue) with perhaps
superior fire-power, depending on which gun you pick up!
You have to shoot your way through mazes which look like the inside of
a computer and rescue the  president's  daughter  who is being held by
the evil Criminal Brain.

There are small computers on the  walls,  which you can use for a)info
b)opening closed doors c)repairing  your  gun  d)repairing yourself or
e)playing silly games such as out-break, meteors and letter puzzle!
The way this game displays  the  ememy's  robot guardians and the wall
nearest to you can be quite confusing.   If the robot is nearer to the
wall at the front of the screen than you then it will only appear as a
flat, grey outline with no  shading  or  detail  until it moves behind
you.  Similarly the nearest wall  of  the  tunnel  will appear as grey
lines when you stand as near to  it as you can.(If you understood that
you`re doing well!!)

This is a fast game, it scrolls smoothly from left to right (and right
to left!) and to enter the next tunnel you can find doors in the sides
€and also the back and front of  the  screen.  To get to the next level
you  have  to  find  the  computers  with  'exit'  on  their  screens,
unfortunately these can teleport you to  almost any level, even levels
that you have already been to.

Odd. Electrocop is unlike  any  other  game  I've  seen.  Its uses the
Lynx's graphics hardware to  good  effect  scaling the backgrounds and
robot monsters. Working where the monsters  are in relation to you can
be confusing, funnily enough this game would probably play better as a
two dimensional overhead view style  gauntlet  game. I couldn't really
get into this game, a definite 'try  before you buy'. Persevere and it
just might be worth it. A visual treat, but the gameplay doesn't quite
match the smart graphics.

GATES OF ZENDICON
=================

I have never really liked this  game,  perhaps because it is too slow.
The screen scrolls at a  slug-like  pace  and your space-ship with it.
Some of the aliens are a bit  faster,  but some hardly move at all and
some of the graphics are hardly awe-inspiring.
€
There are  about  5-10  different  tunes  (probably  nearer  5!) which
alternate between levels, in each one  there  is only about 10 seconds
of music, but this is repeated again and again......
There are different backgrounds to each level and usually a variety of
different aliens, these could be  big  green blobs, U.F.O.s, satellite
dishes with eyes, snake-like things, giant wasps/bees, eyes on stalks,
tanks, jellyfish, grey  socks  that  engulf  your  ship,  pink swords,
plants that grow flowers which fall off and home-in on you...and many,
many more.

The good thing about this game is that  you get level codes so you can
turn it off and come back to it  at  any time.  You start with 4 ships
in the kitty and these go down pretty quickly!
The intro is not  too  bad,  it  uses  sprite-scaling  as do most Lynx
games, but the sampled laugh is of poor quality!!
I suppose if you got into this game you would probably quite enjoy it,
but if you're like me,  into  fast  moving  action games, then I don't
advise you to get it.

SECOND SIGHT: (Leon)

If my memory serves me correctly, 'gates' was the first shoot-em-up to
be released on the Lynx. The pace of the scrolling (especially in easy
mode) can be best described as  serene  -  this has nothing to do with
hardware limitations on  the  Lynx,  its  just  the  way  the game was
designed. In this type of game it is  the rate the enemy ships come at
you, not the speed of  the  scrolling which determines the difficulty.
On easy level, it is pretty damn easy  - I completed it in one sitting
with the help of the passwords.  You  can  then go through it again on
hard level, but do you really want to play through all the same levels
with the monsters speeded up?

There are  some  interesting  enemies,  including  the  windsock  like
creatures that try to suck you  in,  and  there  is a bit of variation
between levels - some you have to  shoot  your way through a maze like
section of walls, others stalactites fall at you.
€
To go from one level to another you pass through a gate - as there may
be a number of gates on each level each having a different destination
there are numerous ways to complete the  game which adds to the game's
durability.

If you want to put  your  feet  up  and  relax with a shoot-em-up, try
this, the worlds first 'mellow' blaster.

CALIFORNIA GAMES
================

Because I bought a lynx classic, I actually got this free with it.  If
I hadn`t I would never have  bought  it!!   For  a free game I suppose
it`s not too bad, but it`s not my cup of tea.

You have the choice of BMX, Surfin`, Half-pipe and Foot-bag.
Only two of these are vaguely playable, foot-bag is crap and half-pipe
is impossible.

BMX is my personal favourite and  it`s okay.  It involves biking along
€a mud track, avoiding bails of  hay  and  blue logs, and doing various
spins and jumps.  You also have a  time limit in which to complete the
track. (there`s only  one  course)  When  you  complete  it  you get a
rating, it could be anything from  'you  need  diapers' to 'as good as
James'.(James Donald-the guy who programmed it.)

Surfing is the only other one that is  okay.  You have to surf along a
wave and then do at least a  360  degree  spin off the top of the wave
and then land back on it without  falling off your board.  If you wait
too long before doing a spin then the  wave rolls over and you loose a
life.  You also have a time limit.

I must admit that I did play this game for a while, however it was the
only game I had for ages.  Graphically  it`s  a treat and the sound is
pretty good,  however  it`s  lacking  in  playability  and  you  loose
interest very quickly.  If you get  it  free with your Lynx then fine,
but don`t even consider buying it!!

SECOND SIGHT: (Leon)

I have mixed feelings  about  this  sports  compilation.  After a nice
intro you are presented with the  choice  of four different games, and
half of them (the BMX and  Surfing)  are worth your time. The graphics
throughout are smart and the tunes  are  pretty good too. The surfing,
though a very simple concept, is surprisingly addictive and the BMX is
also quite good once you work out  how  to do all the tricks. Halfpipe
and footbag aren't even worth playing. I haven't tried the link up but
I don't imagine it would add much to the gameplay.

I can't really recommend this game, certainly not at full price. There
are lots of interesting, innovative  games  out for the Lynx. However,
this isn't one of them.

XENOPHOBE
=========

The story  goes  that  Xenos  (terrifying  aliens)  have  invaded your
planet`s defence space stations and if you  do not stop them they will
be able to adjust to  the  climate  and invade your planet, destroying
mankind.  You must  fight  through  23  levels  and  kill  the 'mother
fester' at the end, who is hatching all the Xenos.  If you do this you
will save your planet and the future  of the human race-or will you?!-
see end sequence!

If you are playing by  yourself  you  have  the  choice of 9 different
characters.  If you are playing a link-up then one of you also has the
option of playing the  snotterpiller!-(the  enemy)  a huge lizard-like
creature which spits snot  and  makes  large  leaps  and funny roaring
noises!!   Playing  this  role  can   sometimes  be  very  satisfying,
especially if you 'hang out'  with  a  gang of snotterpillers.  Social
snotting can be very enjoyable and  phrases  such as 'snot in numbers'
and 'snot a lot' spring to mind!!  But if you want a serious game then
it`s best to leave being the snotterpiller as the last option.

You start with 2000  health  (unless  you`re  a snotterpiller) and the
worst gun you can get. (a little grey effort which shoots peas!)
The space stations have automatic doors  which  slid up when you or an
€Xeno approaches them.  In some rooms there is a % on the wall, this is
the % of Xenos left to get.   You  can  also get a continuous % on the
top right of your screen if you  pick  up a comlynx, but  when you die
you loose this  until  you  pick  up  another  comlynx  with  your new
character.  The % on the wall remains throughout the game.

When you are any of the  characters (except the snotterpiller) you can
walk standing or crawl along and can  also jump-walk. You can shoot in
various directions and if you have picked up a jetpack you can fly.

There is a lift which can take  you  to  the  next floor if you can be
bothered to wait for it (there can  be  any number of floors from 1-5)
but sometimes there are holes in the floor which you can fly down with
your jetpack, or fall down although this way you loose a lot of health
and run the risk of being strangled  to death by tentacles in the room
below.  If you are the snotterpiller you can use the lifts, but normal
snotters can`t.

The Xenos that you will meet are:
PODS--harmless until they hatch
CRITTERS--attach to your skin and drain away your health
ROLLERBABYS--spend most of their time rolling around as hard balls
             which you can`t shoot but unroll into slug-like creatures
             if you hang about for long enough.
TENTACLES--hang down from ceilings or up from floors.
SNOTTERPILLERS--jump 'n' snot.
FESTERS--wait out of sight in door-ways and occasionally peer round.
         Their only way of attacking you is by knocking you down
         with pods that they throw or, if you stand at eye-level they
         paralyse you with their gaze.

If you don`t kill all the Xenos in the base quick enough then the base
becomes overrun and you go onto the next one with no health bonus.

-TIPS-
 ====
Don`t underestimate festers, they can do a  lot of damage and the best
€way to avoid them is  by  crawling  along  and shooting.  To kill them
either crouch down near the door  and  angle your gun diagonally up at
them.  Or use your  jetpack  and  shoot  them on-the-level, they can`t
paralyse you when you`re flying.

Crouch down in door-ways and  shoot  into  the room beyond, if there`s
anything near enough  you`ll  kill  it  without  any  danger of losing
health.

NEVER EVER walk or jump blindly  into  the next room, believe me being
jumped on by a gang of snotters until you die is no fun.
Don`t waste bombs on  small  things  like  critters, (or annoying your
friends!) save them for gangs  of  snotters  and  for the 'sealed Xeno
containment units'.

The quickest way of killing rollerbabys,  when  they are rolled up, is
to throw a bomb and then shoot  them  so they bounce off a closed door
and straight onto your bomb, however timing is everything here.

On levels with the really  annoying  security  droids then remember to
turn them off with the  red  card,  you`ll  find this somewhere on the
level. A quick way of teleporting to the top level and the place where
you turn them off is by looking for  the green square next to the % on
the wall, press option two when you are next to it.

On levels where the base is on  fire  always leave a few Xenos so that
you get a  chance  to  pick  up  your  gun.   Being  left  with a fire
extinguisher on the next level is not much fun!

You can get a variety of  different  guns but my personal favourite is
the electro-gun, which is not as powerful as the puffer gun, but has a
much better range.

If you see a decent  gun  try  to  memorize  the  room number (this is
displayed on the top of your screen) it is in, incase you loose yours.
If you are really desperate for  a  gun  look for the droid that moves
about on the floor, if you don`t  have  a gun he`ll chuck you one, but
€it`ll be crap!

To kill the mother fester  crawl  behind  her, shooting and then shoot
diagonally up at her head.  It will look as if you`re not killing her,
but she takes hardly any shots to kill.

For a laugh, if you have a critter on you and you`re in a room with an
energy hole in (a hole with an orange  glow in it) then turn so you`re
facing away from the hole and hit  option one.  For another laugh jump
in the hole yourself and have a frying time!

Don`t linger in energy hole rooms for too long, a marauding rollerbaby
or a fester attack can easily  knock  you  in,  and once you`re in you
can`t get out.

Pick up your friends  bones  (after  they`re  dead!)  to get all their
bombs and some points.

Don`t forget to pick up hardware because you`ll get points for it, and
also some hardware gives you extra health.

I really enjoyed this game,  both  as  a  single  player and part of a
link-up team.  It is not just a platform shoot `em up, but as you play
you keep discovering new eccentricities - I discovered how to teleport
when I pressed option two (because I wanted to use my jetpack) next to
a green square.  However, with even  a  two  player link-up, it is too
easy.  The mother fester is  ridiculously  easy  to  kill and the last
level (23) has only 8 rooms in  it.   It  would be a total joke with 4
players, the high-light of the  game  would  be  the arguments for who
gets the pieces of hardware!   The  best  way  of having a challenging
game (with 4 players) would be to  all  keep the worst gun, or have no
gun at all!

But even so I strongly advise you  to get this game, especially if you
know someone else with a copy, because playing this two player is very
good fun. (I haven`t tried  a  3  or  4  player link-up, but I imagine
it`ll be just as good especially if one of you is the snotterpiller!)
€
SECOND SIGHT: (Leon)

Xenophobe with its Aliens style artwork  and Aliens style storyline is
an interesting game. At first play  it appears an average shoot-em-up,
but persevere and you will begin to learn about all the creatures that
infest the space stations, from  the  pathetic  critters to the vastly
annoying snotterpillars. The gameplay is  very  satisfying - you get a
real feeling of achievement from clearing  a  station of xenos. Like a
lot of titles, it is  more  fun  (but less challenging) in multiplayer
mode. Even though it is  reasonably  easy  to  complete, you will come
back to this game again and again. Another gem.
