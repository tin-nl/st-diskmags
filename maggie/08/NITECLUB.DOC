     Women  - weird creatures aren't they?  It's funny  how  they 
always seem to pick the most braindead morons to go out with.  It 
seems that the lower your IQ,  the greater your sex  appeal.  For 
example,  two  lads  are trying to chat up a girl.  Robert  is  a 
bright, funny chap and Kev is an ameoba type life form.
Girl - "So what did you do last night?"
Kevin - "I discovered a revolutionary new way of transports  that 
costs little and doesn't damage the environment.  I also composed 
a  complete symphony and painted enough stunning artwork  to  put 
the louvre to shame."
Girl(uninterested) - "That's nice. What did you do Kev?"
Kev - "I woz so drunk las nite,  rite, that I pissed all down the 
street.  Ahahahaha! Then I had a chicken curry and puked all over 
this  old Granny.  I then went and vandalised a couple  of  local 
schools  and stole a disabled couple's car and had a right  great 
joride  through  the  nite.  I  then crashed into  a  school  bus 
killing all the passengers. It woz hellish funny!!"
Girl(laughing) - "How cute! Do you want a shag then?" 

     It's amazing how computers turn girls off. Here is a chat-up 
line that really doesn't work:
"Do you want to come back to my place and see my 40Meg hardrive?"
     To  most girls,  computer users are in the same category  as 
trainspotters.   This   isn't  true  -  some  trainspotters   are 
interesting.
     When you're out with your mates 'on the town' you never dare 
mention  the dreaded word 'computers' which puts you amongst  the 
lowest dropouts of the town.  I know many closet computer  owners 
who  never admit to owning them when they're with their  friends. 
How many conversations in your pub start with:
     "Have you seen ULM's latest mega distorter routines?"
     
     If there wasn't such ignorance,  maybe we who make good  use 
of our computers would get more respect.  It is even possible for 
a scenario like this to occur....

The Settings: The 'best' niteclub in town
The Music: Awful (as usual)
The Drink: Too expensive (as usual!)
The Characters:  Tracy,  Dawn and Sharon are eyeing up the  local 
                 'talent'

Tracy: Cwor look!
Dawn: Where?
Tracy: Over there! That's Manikin of TLB!!!
Sharon: Wow! Have you seen his vectorballs demo? It woz stunning!
Tracy: And those 3D routines on Life's a bitch! So fast!
Dawn: He's not really my type. Now that's what I call a man!
Sharon: Who? Oh that one from ULM.
Dawn:  Yes,  what a guy.  Have you seen his four border  overscan 
megadistorter routines? It gives me multiple orgasms!!
Tracy: I suppose it is quite sexy.
Dawn: And he lives in one of them exotic countries doesn't he?
Sharon: What? Luxembourg?
Dawn: Yeah!! All that sea and sand and tropical climate.
Sharon: I prefer Sweden myself. Hey look! There are the guys from 
SYNC! Yoohoo! Hello!
Dawn: What's so special about them?
Sharon: Haven't you seen audio sculpture? It can load in TCB mods 
AND amiga mods,  it displays them on staves if neccessary and can 
output at 50Khz in Stereo on the STE.
Tracy: Stop it! No more! Oooooh I feel so frisky! Oooh look! It's 
Mark Coleman.
Dawn: Who?
Tracy:  You  know,  the one who did the graphics for Cadaver  and 
Gods!  And he uses DEGAS ELITE!!!  The way he handles a mouse  is 
legendary!
Dawn: He can handle my mouse anyday!
Tracy: Oooh you saucy bitch!
Sharon: Sshhh you two! I think I just saw Jochen Hippel!
Dawn: Mad Max? I think I'm going to faint!
Tracy:  Have  you heard his digidrums on Turrican  2?  They  send 
shivers right through me!
Dawn: And that bass in Ninja Remix really sets me pulsating!!
Sharon: You two haven't got a chance. He's mine!
Tracy: What are you gonna do?
Sharon: Just watch me.
     Sharon walks over to where Tex are sitting and sits next  to 
the long haired musical genius. She whispers in his ear:
"Let's make music!"

     This scenario is highly unlikely at the moment,  but imagine 
the  songs  that  might  be  written  if  everyone  was  computer 
literate,
"I love you for your Sync-Scrolling."
"Lovestack"
"Love Hertz"
"ZX81 and life"
     
Maybe by the year 2000 this article won't be so much of a joke!
