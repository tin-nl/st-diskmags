     As the train raced through yet another station, I paused to think 
about the next couple of weeks that laid ahead of me. This was going to 
be the holiday that I had always dreamed of. I was at last going to the 
tropical island of Amiga with my two closest friends, Grifter and Dummy 
(all names changed to avoid law suit!!)
     We had now been travelling for well over eleven hours and all of 
us were looking forward to arriving at the hotel. Out of the corner of 
my eye I could see a small child writing numbers into his notepad. I 
glanced over and the child, wearing glasses and a kagoul sped off down 
the carriage. This seemed very strange to me, but I just put the 
incident to the back of my mind and started to think of the great 
holiday that lay ahead ahead of me. We had been planning this holiday 
since Christmas 1976, when Grifter was born. We instantly knew that 
Grifter was going to go down in history as the worlds greatest lamer. 
Our prediction came true when he stole the Dickhead demo source code 
from Dummy's Mindbum Demo, who had in turn stolen his source code from 
the Dickhead Demo. Confused? So was I, so I planned this holiday to find 
out the real truth. . . . 
     As the train approached the station, Grifter and Dummy started to 
argue about fonts. Womble would have been able to solve the argument, 
but he wasn't here, so the argument carried on until we reached the 
hotel. Luckily the hotel room had three computers, so the first test 
could begin immediately. I opened my suitcase and took out my disk box 
and gave Grifter and Dummy a Dream Weavers menu to lame from. This would 
be an easy task, because the menu had already been lamed off Automation. 
Ten minutes later, Dummy came back with an all new menu. I told them that 
he was meant to lame the menu, but he just shrugged his shoulders and 
returned to the computer. An hour later Grifter had still not completed 
his menu, so I decided to go and see what he was doing. What I saw was 
not a pretty sight. He was sitting beside the computer, typing a scroll 
and wanking in time to The Locomotion by Kylie Minogue. I asked him what 
he was doing, but he just carried on regardless. This was a true lamer. 
Grifter had passed the first test.
     A knock on the door, surprised me, because we didn't have a door. I 
went to the gap in the wall to see who it was. I wasn't quite sure who 
it was, but I knew him from somewhere. He was blonde haired (hard to tell, 
because he didn't have much hair), fat and very ugly. The main thing that 
made me think I knew him, was the smug grin and the unintelligible German 
accent. We sat down and started to talk. As soon as we did this, Dummy 
came over and instantly recognised him as Samuel. This name did not mean 
anything to me, but I presumed that he was another member of Dummy's 
group, The Lame Bastards. Samuel told us that Hydrogene and Analogue 
Madness would be along later. This next test was now going to be 
difficult, because of all the lamers that had started to turn up at our 
room. Luckily, Samuel had brought three more ST's with him. He also agreed 
to put some money towards the hotel bill. It was two hours before 
Hydrogene and Analogue Madness turned up. The next test could now begin. 
I again opened my suitcase and took out a six-pack of Carling-Black Label 
for each person. Whoever could drink a six-pack and then carry on laming 
would be the winner. Samuel was the first one to finish his six cans. He 
walked towards the computer and immediately collapsed into fits of 
giggles. Analogue Madness then finished and started to sing 'Tulips from 
Amsterdam' completely out of tune. Hydrogene then finished and fell 
asleep. Dummy finished his and started to beat up Hydrogene. Hydrogene 
accused Dummy of stealing his Teddy bear and went back to sleep. This left 
Grifter who had still not opened his first can. It was going to take him 
a DECADE (Oh dear!), to open his first can, so I decided to find out what 
his problem was. "Nobody has done a demo like this before. Where am I 
going to get the code from?" Again, Grifter had won this test because of 
his sheer stupidity and because I'm writing this story and I wanted him to 
win.
     Now the tests were over, I could start to enjoy my holiday. I 
chartered a plane to the Island of Count Nought. I wasn't charged anything 
for the flight because I am friends with, 'THE PILOT.' The journey only 
took us half an hour. When we arrived we were instantly greeted by a small 
group of children wearing Kagouls, spectacles held together with 
sellotape, lots of Brylcreem and lots of spots. They were all holding 
notepads. They must have been some kind of 'ALIEN' life form. We were 
asked for some of our coding, because they were about to write another 
Compact Menu with Robocop 15 and Outrun Ethiopia included on it. There was 
also another group of people wearing Trilby hats with tickets stuck in the 
brim. I think these were the real inhabitants of Count Nought. 
Unfortunately I could not stay here long because I had to do some 
sightseeing. My first sight was the 'New Mode'l exhibition at the town 
hall. I wasn't very impressed with this because of the mess of the hall. 
It looked like it had not been cleaned for many weeks. There was a huge 
pool of green 'SLIME' in one corner of the room. There were some nice 
models though. My favourite ones were the Hovercrafts, also known as 
'OVERLANDERS'.
     My second visit was to a Brothel, but I'm afraid I can't tell you 
about that, because then this article would have to be hidden.
     Then, unfortunately, it was time to go back to dreary old England. I 
decided I would go alone, because I had fallen out with the others. I had 
presented myself with the title of 'The Worlds Greatest Lamer.' This did 
not please them, so none of them were talking to me.
