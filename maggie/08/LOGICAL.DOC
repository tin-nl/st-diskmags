   Logical is a game from the Rainbow Arts.  It is programmed  on 
the ATARI ST by Thomas Scholl and it is also aviable on the  good 
old  C-64,  the  IBM PC and on the Amiga  (...).  You  can  order 
Logical or other nice games like Thunderhawk and Magic Pockets (I 
like  it!  One of the best games.) from FUNNY SOFTWARE  Stuttgart 
(ST version:  54.95 DM;  PC version 59.95 DM;  and for our AMIGA- 
guys 59.95DM - CALL:  0711/ 8568534 - 850325 - and since 15/10/91  
0711/8179995). You need a ST, a colour Monitor and your mouse for 
playing this logical game.  Logical is not an action game and not 
a soot-em-up.  It's a nice game with 99 Levels. After this Levels 
you can edit your own levels.

  The game: There are coloured (there are only four colours: red, 
green,  blue  and yellow) marbles which comes single and move  in 
the channels between receptacles.  You have to collect 4  marbles 
of  one colour in one receptacle.  If it's done the marbles  will 
explode and the receptacle becomes empty and you can collect  new 
marbles  in it.  But you have to fill all.  The receptacles  look 
like  burned down if they're already exploded.  If all are  empty 
you leave this level.  There is also a time limit for the  screen 
and a ball-time-limit.  The levels 1 to 18 are easy (The password 
for  level 18 is "MORE ISLANDS"!) but the other levels  are  more 
difficult  and  you have to think and combine.  There is  also  a 
password-system.  The names of the screens are also the passwords 
(e.g. Level 27 - "FALCONS FLIGHT").

  The other game elements are the marble display (this shows  you 
how  many marbles you are moving in the channels,  if  there  are 
more  than  4 you have to put one of them  in  your  receptacle), 
hour-glass  (this  is your time limit),  the colour  stopper  (it 
stops  the  marbles which don't have  this  colour),  the  colour 
changers (this item changes the colour of your marble), direction 
arrows  (you  can only play in this direction),  lights  (a  full 
receptacle  only  explodes  if it's the same  colour  like  upper 
colour of the traffic lights), colour handicap (|---|  a, b, c, d 
                                                | a | stands  for 
                                                |b c| colours and 
                                                | d | the re- 
                                                |___| ceptacle 
which  firstly    explodes  must  have  this  colours),   colours 
forecast (it shows you which colour has the next marble,  so  you 
can plan what do you have to do), teleporters (they send you from 
one to an other channel).

   There are possibilities to change the colour of   the  screen, 
switch  the  sounds or the music of and to load your  own  edited 
screens.

  Logical is a great game for people who have good nerves.  It is 
good playful and it have a nice high-tech-look.  It's silly music 
is  boring but the idea of this game is to have fun with a  brain 
training.  I like this game.  The games BLOCK OUT and RA are also 
from  Rainbow  Arts and Logical is the 3rd one of  this  kind  of 
games.
