                How To Be a Successful Student!!!
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The second print out 'n Keep guide By Chris H..

IMPORTANT!! The operative definition of "Success" on this occasion 
is of an individual who gets what he (or She) wants for as  little 
effort and as much mayhem as possible.. - Ok?

A LITTLE PREAMBLE BIT:- My life and times as a student were  about 
the  same time as those of THE YOUNG ONES,  so any bits that are a 
little out of date, sorry about that..

TO  ASPIRE TO a higher education,  you need one of the  following, 
Good  'A-Level'  type exam grades,  or a talent for blackmail  and 
bribery,  or  else membership by birth of a royal family (Hi there 
Prince  Edward!) The first rule concerning A-levels is,  that they 
are  never good enough to get you into the place you want to  go, 
even if you did well in the 'Mocks. 

So all the hopeful trips you made to prestigious Universities  the 
previous  year  are all for nothing,  as you desperately  scramble 
around for any place that will have you and you 'D' and 'E'  grade 
A-levels,   so   there   are  literally  thousands   of   aspiring 
cyberneticists,  and industrial chemists who are doing the Applied 
Social  Sciences and Basketweaving course at  Scumbag  Polytechnic 
instead, come September...

For  all those who are smugly sitting back with the right  A-level 
grades  in  their first choice university places,  don't  get  too 
smug,  you  have  plenty  of  time to screw up later,  as  I  will 
explain!!!

The  next  bone of contention is that of FINANCE,  in my  day  (We 
walked 16 miles in bare feet etc..) the only way of getting  funds 
was  to apply for a Local Authority grant..  They would do the two 
following  things,  A:- See how much they could screw your parents 
for,  and  B:-  How long they can delay payment for.  It is indeed 
ironic that the very same Local Authority that is delaying payment 
of your grant,  is at the same time screaming for you to pay their 
Hall of residence bills..

The  picure has been complicated since then,  by attempts to get a 
Student Loan system going in the UK, the banks have been less than 
keen to take part..  In my day,  there was a 'student loan' system 
for  when the grant money ran out,  it was called an  'overdraft'. 
But more on this fun subject later...

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:- So there you are at the start of the term,  it 
is like starting a new school,  only there is a lot more of it, as 
a  FRESHER  (New students get this name because their  clothes  are 
clean and new, I suppose, no year-old unwashed socks yet!!)

(Page 2)

There  is a hell of a lot to take in at once,  there are 3 million 
and  one SOCIETIES that people want you to join,  some of the best 
ones  include  the RUGBY society,  where you indulge your  natural 
tendencies   to  get  horribly  pissed  and  indulge  in   strange 
perversions,  there  is  usually a SCIENCE FICTION society,  which 
caters  for  all the wireheads and computer freaks  (One  day  YOU 
might be its PRESIDENT!) The DANGEROUS SPORTS canoeing down  Mount 
Everest  society,  the  POLITICAL societies,  SMALL FURRY  ANIMALS 
AGAINST CAPITALIST REPRESSION society, religious, feminist, and so 
on...

The usual rule is to join too many and stop going to most of  them 
after a couple of weeks of course...

The  pissups  start  almost at once (About 3-4  hours  after  your 
parents have departed..) Firstly by the senior members of the HALL 
you  are living in,  who are delighted to see which freshers  will 
fall over/be sick first, and later on, the FRESHERS BALL...

The FRESHERS BALL consists of people,  male and female first years 
who decide to 'Get to know one another' in a drunken frenzy,  then 
the  next morning,  loath the person who ended up in their bed the 
night  before,  and  have nothing to do with them for the rest  of 
their higher education career..

The  settling-down  process lasts about a  week,  before  Lectures 
start..  OMIGOD lectures!!!! They didn't say there was going to be 
WORK  to be done,  that being the biggest culture shock of the lot 
straight  after your worst hangover that you have had...  We  will 
leave this now, and move on to the brilliant subject of...

ACCOMODATION:-  You have three choices,  Hall of Residence on  the 
Campus,  'cheap'  rented  accomodation,  or  a  tent  city  a`  la 
Kurdistan..

So the least likely option first, tent cities are strictly for the 
Brownies, or Stonehenge-goers, and are no use as a permanent base, 
for  the year,  although you may consider some of the alternatives 
offer little improvement:-

HALLS  OF  RESIDENCE:- These are usually accomodation  blocks,  on 
Campus,  consisting of lots of single rooms. This bare description 
conceals from the user,  a whole year of midnight waterfights with 
rival halls (At the place I went to, one building nearly fell down 
from this, and had to have emergency structural repairs..) Also, a 
whole  bunch  of late pissups,  and the nice person  three  floors 
below  you  with the 200 watt speakers which  you  can  appreciate 
through paper-thin walls..

Halls tend to have three kinds of people in them:-


The 'knitting circle' who never socialise, go to bed at 8 O'clock, 
and infuriatingly hand in ALL their coursework on time..

The  other  extreme is represented by those mad  bastard  P.E.  or 
sports  science students who do nothing BUT go  out  'Beerhunting' 
wine, women and song, etc. They get either low degrees, or none at 
all  (Has anyone met a P.E.  teacher who can count past ten??  - I 
haven't....)

The   third   tendency  is  represented  by  the   rest   of   the 
residents/inmates,  who  manage to combine the two approaches with 
some success...

Whilst  in halls,  you get to endure whatever catering is supplied 
on campus,  this usually starts at abysmal,  and even makes things 
like  Pot  Noodles seem desirable,  A mate of mine wrote  a  great 
story  for  the Poly magazine titled "The Slop-Bin  Slime  Menace" 
which  described  what  happened when  a  normal  mealtime  became 
alive!!

HALLS feature at least some of the following,  Beds which go bump, 
or more correctly, a rhythmic 'squeekity-squeek!' in the middle of 
the  night,  a  lift  with a 'Do not use in case  of  fire'  sign, 
underneath which someone has scrawled "Use an extinguisher instead 
dickhead!" Galvanised metal waste-paper bins (For being sick in if 
you   are  too  pissed  to  stand  up  properly...)  A   half-torn 
'Metallica'  poster  left by last years resident,  a  half-cleaned 
puddle of vomit (also left by last years resident..) Also, several 
pints  of  'home  brew' contained in a jeroboam  thing  which  use 
various   household  cleaning  agents  instead  of   the   correct 
ingredients to 'Give it a bit of a kick' which was responsible for 
putting several hall residents in intensive care last term..

I think you have got the general idea by now...

The  other form of accomodation is the bedsit,  or student-slum... 
There is no avoiding this,  as you are kicked out of your cosy and 
frequently  over-heated  halls,  into something that can  only  be 
described as hell with the heating turned off...

So you want a little more explanation huh?!?!

Well  I  suggest  that  you go out and get  the  videos  for  that 
excellent BBC2 comedy series, THE YOUNG ONES, their portrayal of a 
typical  student household is entirely authentic,  except for  one 
thing... The place was too clean!!!! 



(Heeeeeeres page 4..)




TO get one of these places, you sign away your rights, and most of 
your  terms  grant  to a landlord/lady  who  makes  Hitler  appear 
benign,  and  you  have  the  use of a  place  which  is  probably 
structurally unsound,  leaks a lot,  is very cold, has electricity 
and gas meters which take Gold cards only, has twenty year old Che 
Guevara posters, and thirty year old furniture, and a cooker which 
only explodes on Wednesdays....

In spite of this, these are some of the best times of your Student 
career,  as you can have the sort of parties that are not possible 
or  permissable  in  halls....  A typical student party  is  where 
nobody turns up before the pubs shut, or leave before dawn..

Other  things to try and do include SETTING FIRE TO THE PLACE,  or 
filling  it with smoke,  one of my flat-mates had a job delivering 
free newspapers,  which he didn't,  so we hit on the idea of using 
the  sink as an incinerator..........  Afterwards,  we flooded the 
place............

Also  try for a free ELECTRO-ARC LOBOTOMY by trying to  'fix'  the 
electricity meters,  which are ripping you off, or just GO OUT AND 
GET PISSED as per usual...

The  quality of life depends on the people you are  sharing  with, 
there  is always one lazy git who does not pay their share of  the 
bills or do anything,  they are probably used to having a staff of 
hundreds  of servants run around after them at their mansion,  and 
it is unfortunate if they live with you, it is always wise to look 
very carefully at the choice of people to live out with, whilst in 
halls, otherwise it is too late for regrets...

The   other   situation   to  avoid   is   cohabitation   with   a 
girl/boyfriend,  I see absolutely NO POINT in emulating the dismal 
domestic rituals of your parents, when you are eighteen, the whole 
point is to be free!!  I knew several Sad Bastards who should have 
known better, who referred to their girlfriends as "T'Wife"..

Depressing, isn't it...

Living  out,  means that you can try to COOK FOR YOURSELF for  the 
first time, also DO YOUR OWN WASHING, (Or maybe not..)

A Typical menu:-

              CUISINE a la STUDENT...

Entree..  something  on a plate you cannot put a name,  or a match 
to..

Main course.. Soggy,,, with baked beans...

Dessert... The gas meter went plink at this point, so nothing...


It is now page five (Gosh!  this is going on rather a long time..) 
and now to turn very briefly to DRINK..

This  is  a central part of every students life,  where  all  your 
money goes, and has been discussed more fully in my last LIFESTYLE 
piece..  I  only  really need to add that everything  should  have 
blackcurrant  juice  in it,  or else that you should  be  drinking 
Pernod,  which a kind of French aniseed with added Vodka drink, in 
the  mistaken belief that you are cosmopolitan  and  sophisticated 
and  not  like the common herd at all...  Never mind,  back to the 
Lager...

So  on to the subject of WORK!!!!  for quite a lot of people,  the 
"W"  word is fairly unimportant,  like a change of clean clothing, 
it  is  theoretically possible to do without for the  duration  of 
your  student career,  BUT NOT ADVISABLE,  as you are likely to be 
chucked  off  your  course (And fumigated  by  the  public  health 
people...)

It  is always possible to identify student types,  by the  course, 
they are on...

The  sadistic low-browed gestapo types,  get their training in the 
Gym,  otherwise  known  as the "Rugby-loving P.E.  bastard  Brain-
Washing Centre" and go on to 'teach' in the majority of schools...

All  the  Anarco-Syndicalist veggie 'Morrisey'  fans  against  the 
bomb,  tend  to  do English Literature...  (Anybody remember ' The 
Smiths' that strutting preening dickwipe Morrisey made me want  to 
puke..)

The  latterday hippies and wholefood people all seem to end up  in 
Geography for some reason...

The  really great guys,  with their heads screwed on,  and no hang 
ups, or need to present a false, insincere image to the world, all 
do HISTORY - Guess which course I did?!?!?!?!

We  didn't  have many computer people,  at our place,  but I would 
assume that,  as readers of Maggie, they are ALL OK BY ME, and are 
honourary members of the 'history' category...

You  gotta  eat,  crap,  set fire to things occasionally,  hand in 
essays and coursework, and DO EXAMS!!!!

These  are horrible things that appear,  just when you are getting 
the hang of the student 'lifestyle' to tell you that you have to
move on,  as the next lot of eager, panting 18 year olds want your 
room... Everything you have done for the past three or four years, 
is  just  a  preparation for these final few  weeks...  So  it  is 
amazing that there are no exams for Drinking,  or lying around all 
day...

P.6

Instead,  there are all the horribly unfamiliar subjects, that you 
have  so  carefully avoided for all these terms,  will your  last-
minute revision pay off??

Results day, is YOUR name up there on the board???????? - Enrol in 
a University or Poly near you and find out!!!!!!

Oh  yes,  and by that time you are squillions of pounds in debt to 
the dear old bank,  who want repayment and blood at the same time, 
so you have to go and get a job, OHHHH GODDDDD!!!!!

  ALL FROM ME FOR NOW - CHRIS H (C) Aug '91

  -  Coming soon!!!  a LIFESTYLE piece on what happens  next,  the 
wacky, 'wonderful' world of WORK!!!
