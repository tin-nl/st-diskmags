                          -------------

                 Atari are finally get their act together with  a 
succession  of  new computers that are truly the  finest  in  the 
world.  But  it  is  no good having good  hardware  if  the  user 
interface  is appalling,  the Amiga demonstrates this.  TOS is  a 
million times better than its Amiga equivalent,  though it  isn't 
without its problems.
     The earliest versions of TOS had to be loaded from disk. How 
lame and Amiga-like you may say,  but this did have advantages  - 
you could update TOS very easily,  and if there was a bug in  it, 
this  needn't  be a major problem.  But loading it from  disk  on 
every boot-up was a pain and Atari soon put it on ROM.
     Some  games  coded  for  the early  versions  of  TOS  won't 
recognise  joystick movement on later machines.  This is true  of 
some PD games which have never been updated.
     In the later STs there was TOS 1.4 which boasted an improved 
item  selector and move file option among other things.  TOS  1.6 
was  the  equivalent  version for the  STE  which  was  nicknamed 
Rainbow TOS as when you clicked for info about it, it displayed a 
fuji  logo with colours cycling through it.  Stonehenge  here  we 
come!
     TOS  1.6  contained  some  bugs,   most  noticeable was  its 
inability to boot-up in medium resolution.  These bugs were fixed 
in  TOS 1.62,  but they really shouldn't have been there  in  the 
first place. 
     Now showing on a Mega STE near you is TOS Version 2,  and it 
is very different to version 1.62.

     The first thing you notice about TOS Version 2 is the pretty 
graphics - a 'groovy' background.  Then you move up to menu  bars 
and discover a wealth of options:

          The  letters  enclosed  in  square  brackets  are   the 
keyboard  shortcuts for various functions,  accessed by  pressing 
shift  and  a key.
     The use of most of these functions is obvious,  but some are 
more obscure.  'Bottom to top' swaps the currently active window, 
useful  if you have a lot of windows open on the screen and  want 
to  access  one  obscure by the others.  Select  all  items  will 
highlight  every  file in the current path,  much more  fun  than 
holding down shift and selecting each item!
     The Format Floppy Disk option is a revelation.  Not only can 
you format single sided and double sided,  but,  wait for it, you 
can format to 1.44 meg!  This means Atari will be installing high 
density disk drives into their future computers! And Amiga owners 
thought they were clever because they had 880k drives!
     The  size  to  fit option is useful;  when  you  have  files 
displayed   as  icons  they  often  spill  out  of   the   window 
horizontally.  With size to fit on, they can't do this. They will 
fill  the open window space.  If there still isn't  enough  space 
then  they  will be placed vertically below the contents  of  the 
current  window.  Accessing these files is simple as now you  can 
use Cursor Up and Down keys to scroll through a  window.  Another 
hassle  caused by earlier versions of TOS happened when you  were 
copying a number of files from a disk containing a lot of  files. 
When  you highlighted the files currently displayed and tried  to 
scroll  the window down to access other files,  the  files  you'd 
already  highlighted were automatically deselected.  Not so  with 
TOS V2,  items remain highlighted even when you scroll through  a 
window.
     Installing  desktop  icons is fun.  As well  as  having  the 
boring  old  drawers  and  trash can  icons,  TOS  V2  has  icons 
representing  fonts,  art packages,  hard drives,  laser and  dot 
matrix printers, typewriter (for a WP), tools (for a utility) and 
a  book among other things.  There are trendy little  disk  icons 
which  you can use for drive A & B instead of  the  drawers.  The 
icons of files in windows can be changed.  Previously icons could 
only  be a square with a shaded top for an executable file and  a 
pile  of  paper with a corner turned over  for  a  non-executable 
file. Now you can choose whatever icon you want for whatever file 
you  want.  You  can  also drag files out  of  windows  onto  the 
desktop,  this  makes  them  easier to find  and  they  will  run 
providing  you have the disk with the file on in the  drive.  You 
can place a printer icon on the desktop,  and when you want files 
printed you simply drag them onto this.
     Set preferences hasn't changed much, you still choose if you 
want file deletes/file copies/file overwrites verified.  You  can 
switch between resolution - and it still has to reboot.
     When  setting the desktop background you have a choice of  8 
different   patterns   and  2/4/16  colours  depending   on   the 
resolution.  
     Reading  Inf files is useful,  if you have a desktop  you've 
carefully saved you don't have to reboot just to display it, this 
reads a desktop inf file and displays that desktop.
     You can move files by holding down control when you drag and 
release them.  If you press the right mouse button when  dragging 
and releasing files then you can copy and rename them.
     The  item selector will be familiar to users of TOS 1.4  and 
above,  nothing  astounding  but  better than  the  original  one 
(just).  Take my advice and invest in the Universal Item Selector 
Three (œ19.95 from the ST Club).
     Overall this is a major improvement,  and it was what the ST 
needed,  the success of Neodesk proves  this.  While its features 
may  not  be  as  comprehensive as Neodesk,  it  is  a  lot  more 
interesting  to  look at and more functional  than  the  original 
desktop.  I  think  this TOS will only be found in the  Mega  STE 
which  is  a shame because it would enhance  the  standard  STE's 
reputation  if it had such a glowing desktop.  Its not  Mac-like, 
its  not even up to Neodesk's standard,  but at least  Atari  are 
taking a step in the right direction. Well done.
