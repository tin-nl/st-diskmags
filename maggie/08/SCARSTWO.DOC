     Gremlin are at it again!  Making racing games that is! After 
creating Team Suzuki,  Motor Massacre,  Super Scramble Sim, Lotus 
Turbo  Esprit Challenge,  Toyota Celica GT Rally  and  Supercars, 
Gremlin bring you Supercars 2, or more precisely, Magnetic Fields 
bring you Supercars 2.
     The programming team behind this game are:
Shaun Southern and Andrew Morris
Music: Barry Leach
Communication Screen Graphics: Jeremy Smith
Additional Work: Peter Liggett
     The  basic  idea  will be familiar to anyone  who  has  ever 
played  supersprint or any of its variants.  This is a view  from 
above  race game set over three levels 21 courses.  This  aim  is 
quite simple; finish in the top 5 out of the 10 competing cars to 
qualify  for the next race.  There is also a points system and  a 
championship table.  Win a race and you get 5 points. Come second 
and you get just four. For a third you get three points, a fourth 
will get you two while fifth gives you one point.  Finish in  any 
other  place  and  you  get  no  points.  Also,  the  better  the 
qualification place,  the more money you get.  This money can  be 
used to repair a damaged car and also for the Trade shop.
     The shop is the interesting part and it's what helps to make 
Supercars  2 a little bit different from those early  supersprint 
clones. In here you can buy a range of weapons and upgrades which 
transform your car from a banger to a sleek mad-max type  vehicle 
(and I'm not talking Jochen Hippel here!). 
     In the shop you can buy:
Front Missiles:  Cheap and useful.  This fire in a straight  line 
in front of your car when fired. Suggested buying price œ150.
Read Missiles: As above but go behind your car to take out people 
trying to overtake you. Buy as above.
Homer Missiles: When fired these go along the centre of the track 
(even round corners) until they hit a car.  Expensive but can  be 
useful on windy courses.
Super Missiles:  These spin around your car providing  protection 
from other cars trying to overtake or ram you.
Mines:  Mid  range price and useful on narrow courses.  When  you 
drop  these small circular objects they lie on the track until  a 
car  touches (or the fuse runs out) and then explode.  Drop  them 
under tunnels to annoy your friends!
You can also buy:
Armour:  This  is the best thing to buy as it protects  your  car 
from  a certain amount of missiles/mines/rams.  It can  be  quite 
expensive but is best bought at about œ1000.
Ram:  Cheap  and  effective.  This  can  bought  very  early  on. 
Suggested buying price œ450 
Engine: Speeds up your car. This can be more of a hinderance than 
a  help  on courses with many sharp bends.  The  priceof  engines 
varies greatly between œ1200 to œ5000. If they're just over œ2000 
they should be bought!
Nitros:  Give  you an extra boost of speed and make your car  fly 
into the air!
     You  can  only have two weapons fitted to your  car  at  one 
time,  one on the front and one on the rear.  For example, if you 
wanted homing missiles and nitros you'd click on front then click 
on homers,  then you'd click on rear and click on nitros.  In the 
race pushing forward would unleash a homer,  whilst pulling  back 
would let rip a nitro.
     When the games loads you can either watch the attract screen 
or  get  straight into the game.  The attract  screens  are  just 
static pictures depicting a sickeningly American newscast  'Super 
Cars 2 News'. Corny, well drawn but nothing special. There is one 
picture giving details of the car's technical specifiactions with 
an  animated  car spinning around in very similar vein  to  Lotus 
Esprit Turbo Challenge.  Infact the whole game retains an escence 
of this classic game with the same fonts used,  the same  options 
screen and the same track info screens.
     On the options screen you can pick your level,  each one has 
7 courses.  The obvious tip here - start on easy level.  You  can 
play with one or two players - when playing with two players  the 
screen  is  split  in  two  down  the  middle  with  player   one 
controlling   a  flashy  red  car  and  player  two  having   the 
environmentally sound green one.

                         ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
     The graphics in the intro screens are very nice and the  in-
game graphics are well presented if nothing out of the  ordinary. 
The cars are responsive and move swiftly enough and the scrolling 
is easy on the eyes in all respects.
     It's  a shame the music doesn't reach the high standards  of 
the rest of the game. It is truly abysmal. There is just a single 
piece  of  chip music that plays throughout the  game,  and  this 
isn't decent semi-digi chip music like most of the pieces by  Mad 
Max or Count Zero, it sounds more like something created with the 
music  extension  on STOS!  Even on the intro screens  where  the 
proccessor is doing nothing but displaying static pictures,  they 
have not put sountracker or even sampled music over them. Gremlin 
make great games but must try a lot harder on the music front.

     This  is probably the most enjoyable car game available  for 
the ST. Easy to get into on the lower levels while the later ones 
will have you cursing.  Two player mode makes a good game  better 
and  I  can honestly say that this is one of the few  games  I've 
loaded  up again and again this summer.  It's much more  playable 
than  either  Badlands or Ivan Ironman Stewart's and  deserves  a 
place in everyone's collection. If you only buy one car game, buy 
this.

Here are some hints and tips to help you along:
The  most  important  item to buy is armour as  it  protects  you 
against a finite amount of missiles/rams.  Being destroyed is the 
surest way of losing positions.
Easy Level:
Course 1
Race  on the outside of the track avoiding all the  missiles  and 
try not to get into scuffles with other cars.  Remember you  have 
no protection on this level. Just be careful out there!
Course 2
Shoot  as many cars as possible at the start or the race  and  on 
the  straight.  Don't be afraid to brake at the jump if their  is 
slow  traffic there - it's better to do this than to hit  another 
car and not make the jump.
Course 3
Get  an engine upgrade and ram if possible.  As they  isn't  much 
room  to overtake,  simply bash the other cars out of  your  way. 
Missiles are pretty useless because of the constant bends in  the 
road. Speed and good steering should see you through.
Course 4
Computer controlled cars now have mines (yes,  they're the  small 
circular objects on the track that make your car go 'boom!'), but 
these are relatively easy to avoid becasue of the wide straights.     
For a good laugh try ramming a computer car into a mine (or  even 
better - hit player 2 into one!).  Enter the tunnels straight and 
you should have no problems. This is a course built for speed. Go 
for it!
Course 5
Buy nitros to jump the train - tricky but possible. Your position 
constantly  fluctuates,  but with engine upgrades and nitros  you 
should outrun the competition.
Course 6
The jump is easier than it looks, if there is slow traffic on it, 
don't  hesitate  to brake.  Try to shoot the other  cars  on  the 
straight  before the jump.  When approaching the jump don't  slow 
down,  just turn through 90 degrees at the corner and you'll make 
it.  Speed isn't really neccessary for this race as it makes  the 
car more unweildy to control.
Course 7
Spend  all your money on the shop beforehand.  By now you  should 
have  full  armour,  ram and engines.  Spend the  rest  on  front 
missiles and nitros.  At the start of the race blow away as  many 
opposition vehicles as possible. Use nitros on the straights (use 
only  on the home straight if you are positoned  correctly!).  Be 
wary  of the opening gate,  if it has just opened or is about  to 
open,  brake  and turn through it,  otherwise go round -  it  not 
worth dying and losing many positions to save a second.  This  is 
no walkover but plenty of missiles and fully equipped car  should 
see you through.
