In Denmark,  a teenager recently had to go to the  hospital, he 
suffered  a disease called 'the computer syndrome'.It looked like 
he   wasn't   able   to   make   the   difference   between   his 
computerprogrammes and reality.

The  symptoms  are:  12-16  hours  a  day  behind  the  keyboard, 
sleeplessness,  shakiness and attaching 'supernatural powers'  to 
the  microcomputer.  In  addition this boy considered  people  as 
advanced  computersystems.  Doctors think that there are  ca.5000 
computer'freaks'  in Denmark,  although not all in these  extreme 
cases.

95% of these wiz kids are boys, between 14 and 18 yo. They get up 
at  1 or 2PM,  and sit behind the screen till the early  morning, 
in  the meanwhile,  they'll drink 5 liters of COCA  COLA. 
They only eat when they are really hungry, preferably fast-food.   

Computerfreaks  are  not specially gifted  (hey,that's  what  the 
doctors  say)  but they have a special talent  for  understanding 
complex  structures.   For  this  reason  they  know  more  about 
computers then most prof.specialists.
