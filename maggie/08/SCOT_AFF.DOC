                             A report by Darkman of T-deF - A Roving Reporter

    Well, what can I say about this show, the first ever Scottish computer 
show.  The fact is, I can't say anything good about.  Calling it 'exceedingly
crud' is maybe to high a level to place it.  All that was there were some
unheard of companies selling games at cheap prices.  I think also that Compo
were there demonstrating Write ON! (the guy demonstrating it was wearing an
Atari baseball cap). But that was all.  Not even a PD Library (except a shitty
IBM one).  Office Choice (from Cumbernauld) were supposed to be there, but on
the day they weren't.  All I got was a copy of ST Applications and Scorpion
bought 10 blank disks.  After about an hour of wandering round the tiny square
hall, we decided to get the hell out of it and walked on down to MacDonalds,
where all the staff were in fancy dress! This was much more fun than the
so-called 'Fair'!! There was also an incredibly sexy girl wearing a karate
suit!!  Wow, she had extremely large mammary glands and we spent more time
watching her than we did wandering around the 'fair' and it was at least
triple the fun!!!!! That was about all we did this day, because we had to go 
home and do some homework (shitty school).

PS.  We and The Fingerbobs were supposed to release a demo here, but it
wasn't ready (thank god)

PPS  We didn't actually pay œ4 each to go into this show, because I won the
tickets in some competition on Teletext (crap computer magazine called FX)

PPPS  There is another show on December 1st, but I don't think we'll go to it


     Go read another text in this Maggie  --  Darkman of T-deF
