The  STFM  is dead!  I never thought I would see the day  that  I 
would say these dreaded words with a smile on my face,  and while 
I'm  not grinning from ear top ear,  I am pleased at this  trusty 
machine's  demise.  I'm  not sadistically glorifying the  end  of 
wonderful  machine,  but  I  see at as a birth of  an  even  more 
awesome computer, one whose name shall become a legend.

Some sections of the computer press and Amiga owners  (scientific 
name  Biggus Lamerus),  have criticised every fundamental  aspect 
of  the STFM since its release.  At first ST owners  ignored  the 
ignorant  rambling of these unfortunate few who secretly  desired 
to  own  the  great Atari  16-Bit  wondermachine.  But  what  had 
originally  been  a whisper of damming grew to a  crescendo  with 
more and more people buying Amigas,  PCs and Archies.  (OK,  so I 
lied  about last one!).  The STFM was ridiculed  relentlessly  by 
even such mainstream magazines as New Computer Express.

ST  owners  are  tough individuals and it takes  more  than  some 
cynical  comments  from  lamers to perturb  them.  But  what  did 
disappoint  us  more than anything were the  software  companies, 
those  former allies of Atari whose bevvy of releases for the  ST 
had  given it a foothold on the market and given it  a  headstart 
over  the  Amiga  and other attempts  at  16-Bit  machines  (i.e. 
Amstrad's PC200!). Computer games were developed as follows:
The  game  was  coded on the ST as  programmers  recognise  as  a 
better   machine   for  development  due  to   it's   speed   and 
reliability.
Graphics  were developed with the ST's 16-Colour  restriction  in 
mind.
Sound was generally ignored apart from some spot FX.  Ironically, 
old  games feature better sound than some of the latest  releases 
as  a lot of games were designed to be viable on 8-Bit  and  thus 
didn't  use  the  16-Bit's full memory potential  and  there  was 
space for meaty samples to be included in the game.
Once  the  ST product was finished and released (typically  at  a 
price  of  around  œ19.99),  'work'  was  started  on  the  Amiga 
version.
I use the term 'work' very loosely as the main code and  graphics 
were  simply  ported  over to the  Amiga.  Only  rarely  was  any 
amendment  made  to this and that was just a tarting  up  of  the 
graphics - nothing major.  Sometimes a soundtrack was added,  and 
this  was  the  only real difference between  the  ST  and  Amiga 
versions  of  games except Amiga games were released  two  months 
later  with an extra œ5 on the price.  œ5 for a  soundtrack?  You 
may  as well buy an album!  (In those days you could  buy  albums 
for  œ5!).    With  this  system  you  begin  to  understand  the 
laziness of typical software houses and the inability of them  to 
take  advantage of the extra capabilities of the self  proclaimed 
'games machine'.
When   development   of   real  16-Bit   games   (ones   designed 
specifically  to take advantage of the extra memory and speed  of 
the  machines) programmers began to run up  against  difficulties 
with  the STFM.  It's no simple process to get smooth  horizontal 
scrolling,  or  big  sprites or many sprites moving  quickly  and 
smoothly.  These are the main requirements of 90% of games on the 
market today.  Coders begin to wish for the good old  C-64.  Even 
that  had hardware scrolling.  (So did the Atari 8-Bits and  they 
had 4 channel sound.  But that's another  story...).  Programmers 
began  to  realise  they could achieve stunning  effects  on  the 
Amiga  with the minimum of effort and Amiga-specific games  began 
to reach the shops. These had two things in common:
1)  Amazing  presentation.   They  were  visually  and  sonically 
stunning.
2)  No  gameplay  -  They were  absolutely  devoid  of  addictive 
qualities.
The programmers claimed these games were 'impossible' to  convert 
to the ST because of the machines 'limitations'.  I think the  ST 
could've coped with games such as 'Hybrid' and 'Battle  Squadron' 
quite capably.  Infact,  with the talent of some of the ST coders 
now  in famous demo crews,  ST versions of these games  could  be 
made  that  outstrip the Amiga version - but  that's  beside  the 
point.
The Press now had the foundations for it's Anti-ST campaign.  How 
could  an ST possibly run great games with all it's  limitations. 
Their definition of a good games machine was one with:
* Hardware scrolling
* Stereo sound
* Blitter
* 4096 colour palette
And  as the STFM possessed none of these features,  it should  be 
consigned to the nearest scrapheap.  Atari noted the feelings  of 
the  populous  and  also  saw  the shift  to  the  Amiga  in  the 
marketplace.  In their infinite wisdom they designed the STE, the 
should-have-been  computer.  It included all the features  listed 
above and basically was a direct competitor for the games  market 
the Amiga was beginning to dominate and it had the advantages  of 
having great MIDI,  business,  programming and DTP support  along 
with  greater speed and greater reliability.  It  was  everything 
the  STFM should have been.  Atari had a winner on their hands  - 
or so they thought.  Ironically,  the great christmas demand  for 
the ST was the STE's downfall as the machine was rushed into  the 
shops  with no prior warning to software developers.  This  meant 
that  some of the current titles on release were  not  compatible 
with the STE.  The number of these titles was vastly  exaggerated 
by  the  computer  press,  with  one  respected  weekly  magazine 
claiming  that 80% of software would be incompatible - shows  how 
much  they knew!  Unfortunately there was also a minor  bug  with 
the  desktop  which stopped people from saving their  desktop  in 
medium  res.  Because of this bug some areas of the press  dubbed 
the   STE  a  turkey  which  is  hardly  fair  considering   it's 
insignificance  in  everyday use - if you are  playing  games  or 
using the majority of paint packages,  you don't need to boot  in  
medium  res and if you are really serious about your ST you  will 
own  a  mono monitor.  If the worst comes to the  worst  you  can 
change to medium res with the set preferences  option.  Annoying, 
but hardly the end of the world.
Atari  released  a patch to fix the desktop bug  and  the  better 
software   houses   upgraded  their  games  to  make   them   STE 
compatible.   Even  some  demos  were  upgraded  to  become   STE 
compatible!
But  by  this time many people had been put  off  the  STE.  It's 
named  had  been dragged through the mud for so  long  by  N.C.E. 
that it seemed that its reputation was forever tarnished.
But now, at last, things are beginning to brighten up.
Sales  of  the STE family curriculum pack  have  far  outstripped 
even Atari's wildest predictions.  People are upgrading from  FMs 
to  Es and the STE is a respected home computer that  the  public 
is at last buying in decent quantities.  The STE is really making 
its  mark on the ST owning population of this country - infact  a 
recent  survey  by  ST  Format showed that  a  quarter  of  their 
readers  had  an  STE,  and these are statistics  that  can't  be 
ignored.
But software houses are doing an excellent job of ignoring  them. 
How many ST specific games have been released? None.
How many games include enhanced STE features? Very, very few.
A  few companies have said that games would include enhanced  STE 
features,  but very few have them. The only games that do support 
the STE's extra power include:
Future wars,  Vaxxine,  James Pond, Wings of death, Chronicles of 
Omega,  Rock  Star Ate My Hamster,  Enchanted Lands,  Space  Ace, 
Wrath of The Demon,  Dragon's Lair. And I don't believe there are 
many more.
As  a lot of companies still produce their games on single  sided 
disks  then there is plenty of space to add STE  enhancements  on 
the other side of the disk. This extras could take the form of:
*Sampled  soundtrack  - To quote the current issue  of  Ace  "the 
music,  as  performed by the ST's tinnier sound chip,  lacks  the 
atmosphere  of  the Amiga version".  As the STE  has  stereo  DMA 
sound,  you  can have a sampled soundtrack playing  which  hardly 
burdens  the  proccessor.  Efficient routines have  been  created 
which  allow you to play 4-Channel sound module using around  10% 
of  the  proccessor time which gives you plenty of time  to  move 
sprites etc.  Sampled soundtracks can be directly converted  from 
the  Amiga and added to the STE version of a game with a  minimum 
of effort.
*Hardware  Scrolling.   Getting  the  STFM  to  scroll  smoothly, 
especially if you are using a large scroll area,  is an  acquired 
skill.  Many  games haven't been attempted on the ST  because  of 
their  need  for fast smooth scrolling (Hybris  etc.).  and  many 
more  games  are let down by poor,  slow  jerky  scrolling  (e.g. 
Shadow  of the Beast).  Even the classic Kick Off 2  is  affected 
with  Dino Dini claiming he couldn't implement on pitch  graphics 
for  different  pitches  because of the  ST's  lack  of  hardware 
scrolling.  None of the above would be a problem using the  STE's 
hardware scrolling.
*Enhanced  Graphics.  Readysoft  games already  use  more  subtle 
shading  in STE versions of their games by using the 4096  colour 
palette  and so should other games.  With all the processor  time 
saved  with DMA sound and hardware scrolling,  palette  splitting 
effects can be used to display more than the standard 16  colours 
on screen.  Even STFM games like Turrican display over 40 colours 
on screen.
*Blitter.  This can be used to make graphics faster and smoother. 
It  may not be as advanced as Blitters found in other  computers, 
but it can help to make a faster, better game.
If software houses begin to take advantage of these features,  we 
will get no reports like the following:  "Good as the ST  version 
is looking,  the Amiga version will be even better!  The  Amiga's 
blitter and hardware scrolling facilities will be fully used  for 
a  faster  game,  and  the Amiga's wider  palette  will  also  be 
implemented  to give subtler colouring to the graphics"  (Tiertex 
on their forthcoming release, Mega Twins).
These  features could easily be implemented on the STE,  but  for 
some  reason  Tiertex  have ignored  this  fact.  This  ignorance 
amongst software developers must be stamped out.  It's about time 
that   the  growing  band  of  STE  owners  are  recognised   and 
respected.  Instead  of having 'Amiga only' games we should  have 
'Amiga and STE only' games.  I look forward to the day when there 
will be 'STE Only' games.
So  if  you are involved in developing software of any  sort  for 
the ST, don't forget the power and possibilities of the STE.
