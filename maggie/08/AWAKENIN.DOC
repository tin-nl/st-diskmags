KRUZ is a new group from Finland presenting you their first demo.


Review:
-------


Intro:
------
It's  a  fullscreen with the tv-effect seen in  TCB's  intro  for 
their "Swedish New Year"-screen.  The borderroutine for the lower 
border  isn't perfect,  sometimes the border is still  closed  or 
flickering (at least on my ST).
If  you have enough of this screen,  press space and  you'll  see 
some graphics telling you the name of this demo. You'll also hear 
a soundtracker music. Nothing special but not crap.

Menu:
-----
You  control  a little mousepointer not with the mouse  but  with 
your  cursorkeys.  It's  a fullscreen with four  little  pictures 
representing the four different screens.  Again there's the  same 
problem  with  the lower border.  I can't read the names  of  the 
screens and so I just give them numbers from 1 to 4.

Screen 1:
---------
A  big  KRUZ-logo  with  a  shadow  flying  around,  a  fourplane 
scroller,   a   starfield   and  some   tracking   sprites.   Not 
mindblasting, but looks nice.

Screen 2:
---------
There's a tube scroller, a sinescroller, a big oneplane scroller, 
a  fourplane  scroller  and a  music  selector.  Again  not  very 
original but ok.

Screen 3:
---------
There's  a rotating starfield and a very big scroller (upper  and 
lower  border removed).  Of course we have seen such  screens  at 
least ten times, but who cares?

Screen 4:
---------
A  moving background with rasters like in  TCB's  "Led-Scroller", 
some swinging (ugly) graphics,  a scroller (2 planes),  and  some 
tracking sprites.

Hiddenscreen:
-------------
In  the  mainmenu  just enter "YURK" (on  German  keyboards)  and 
"ZURK" (on any other).
You'll  get  a  desktop  piccy with  some  bombs  and  a  sampled 
laughter.  Some  seconds  later you'll see a  starfield  and  the 
addresses of the KRUZ members.


General overview:

It's one of the first bigger demos coming from Finland,  it's not 
original at all,  neither the coding nor the graphics are  really 
mindblasting, but if you collect demos you should have it in your 
collection. But the work of KRUZ looks promising. Hope their next 
demo  is coming out soon (I think they are working together  with 
Aggression, and they are quite good too).
