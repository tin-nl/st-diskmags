
     "OPERATION 'OH SHIT'" - The concluding part of this
                             Exciting Action Adventure!!


A Rumble in The Jungle...

They set off that night,  the colonel patriotically stayed behind, 
although he was about six bricks short of a full load,  he was not 
suicidally  stupid,  and  did not fancy the idea of  dying  rather 
earlier and more horribly than he would have otherwise wanted...

So in the boat,  leading the ship of fools was Lieut. Chinstycker-
Fforbes,  in  the best tradition of letting the rest of the men do 
all the work whilst he pointed at them a lot..

'Sgt'  Henry,  Craig  thingy  was in charge of  vests,  and  metal 
identity  dogtags dangling invitingly near his  pectoral  muscles, 
whilst  'Sgt' Jason Donovan was looking after the big floppy  bush 
hat and the machete for the mandatory 'Hacking through the jungle' 
bit...

Corporal Einstein,  as the sole interesting, intelligent character 
in  this  story was in charge of navigation,  steering  the  boat, 
watching out for enemy activity, and making the tea.. The "Stan's" 
were  simply told to lie down in the bottom of the boat and  check 
for leaks by drowning...

It was a dark, moonless night, and the only sound to be heard, was 
the  rythmic thump of the boats diesel engine,  and the occasional 
gurgle, as one or other of the 'Stans' succumbed to an overdose of 
water..

Approaching  the  enemy-held section of the coast  the  order  was 
given to turn-off the engine,  the idea being to drift silently in 
with the tide,  for which purpose the lieutenant was to refer to a 
small book of tide tables...

"Well where is it?!!?" he hissed, "The little green book, about so 
big, this is the book for tree recognition you've given me.."

"If  you  look more closely sir,  I think this will  help.."  Said 
Private Einstein..

And  indeed  there was a small  sub-title,  "TREE-RECOGNITION  and 
Tidal  patterns  for the Northern New Guinea coast.." But  it  was 
pitch-black, so no-one could read the book anyway, and the Colonel 
had  insisted that all lights and flares were left behind in  case 
any elephants in evening dress spotted the task-force..

So they were in the shit already...

"And we haven't even encountered any Japs yet!" Wailed Sgt 'Craig' 
thingy..

This  last remark was drowned out by the booming of surf on  sharp 
jagged  rocks,  and  that  sound  was getting  louder..  This  was 
nothing,  compared  to  the  sound that ships timbers  make,  when 
splintering on unyielding rocks, about thirty seconds later.....

.....It  was  dawn,   the  lieutenant  was  the  first  to  regain 
conciousness, and the first thing to do was...

"How many of the 'Stans' made it to the shoreline?" he asked.

"Uh, about three or four of them," replied Jason D..

"Damn,  we needed at least six of them intact, to throw themselves 
on  to the Japanese guns,  in a foolhardy pointless gesture at the 
end  of  the mission,  three is not enough..  This mission clearly 
needs  some  replanning.."  And  having said  that,  off  went  to 
lieutenant to ponder this latest crisis...

And about ten minutes later returned triumphantly..

"Now  the plan is as follows,  The remaining 'Stans' are to try to 
get  round the enemy defences at their thickest point,  about four 
miles  north of here,  whilst they are providing a diversion,  and 
entertainment  for the enemy,  the two Soap star sergeants are  to 
engage  the  Karaoke  Machine itself,  in a  head-to-head  singing 
contest,   whilst   Corporal   Einstein   attempts  to   built   a 
Uranium/Plutonium  Fission device with a projected yield  of  some 
twenty  to thirty megatons,  and whilst all that lot is going  on, 
I'll  hit  the Jap sentry guarding the Karaoke  Machine  over  the 
head, and plant the explosives and get out.."

It  was  a  plan designed for maximum  utilisation  of  individual 
talents, but it went something like....

......Both  'Jason'  and 'Henry' were in position,  the Japs  held 
their  fire,  unsure  of  what  to do,  in the presence  of  these 
magnificently  unreal specimens of Australian manhood,  a terrible 
wailing  started to resonate through the jungle,  as the distorted 
chords  of  "Too Many Broken Hearts" started to  piece  themselves 
together,  'Jason'  hissed,  "The  Little Yellow bastards,  they've 
ruined that song.."

It was all over in about three minutes, twenty seven seconds...

The  'Stans'  started  off  quite well,  one of  them  managed  to 
entangle himself on the barbed wire,  in full view of about half a 
dozen  machine  gunners,  what was left afterwards,  was not worth 
describing...  But then, they ran into problems, as one of the Two 
remaining 'Stans' attempted to throw himself on to a grenade... It 
didn't go off,  nor did the other six, that he had pulled the pins 
out of... As the Japs were such poor shots, the two last surviving 
'Stans' took it in turns to strangle one another,  and there ended 
their story...

Einstein  manged to get his bomb to the prototype stage,  but then 
got  a better offer from Hollywood,  to do the special effects  in 
their new film, "STAR WARZ - The Empire goes PPTTHHHRRTTT!!!"

Which left the gallant lieutenant Chinstyker, hand upraised, about 
to strike a blow against the evil,  depraved Jap War machine, when 
a  nearby sentry shoved the pointy end of a rather large rifle  up 
his left nostril...

"What you want.." short, and to the point....

"Tree  recognition,,,,"  the Lieutenant blurted,  "Look,  that's a 
tropical hardwood palmtree over there..."

Wrongggg!!!!   BLAMMMMM!!!!!!    Splatttt!!!!!

"Nowhere  near,  doesn't  know  what  he is  bluddy  well  talking 
about.." was all the Sentry had to say afterwards..

AFTERWORD:-

The colonel reflected on what had gone wrong,  his handpicked team 
had all succumbed to disaster,  after all,  what could you do once 
the elephants were lining up against you....

At  that  point,  a small cockroach called Philip,  stuffed to the 
gills  with  a new top secret formula explosive decided to  go  to 
sleep under the sole of the colonel's left boot....

....The resulting crater,  is,  some forty-odd years later,  quite 
attractive, and filled with water, is now known as Madfiend Lake..

The  Karaoke Machine did not go into service,  it was judged to be 
too  horrible,  even  by a notoriously unsqueamish  Japanese  High 
Command, to use on a helpless enemy....

Unfortunately, 'Jason Donovan' did not really die... He just gives 
an impression of being that way...

One  of the 'Stans' survived the shipwreck,  became disgusted with 
the whole idea of war, and became a nun... Some forty years later, 
he is now a stunt double for Mother Theresa of Calcutta...
