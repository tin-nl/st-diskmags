WORST DEMO CREW:  CSM

BEST DEMO:        Union, Cuddly, B.I.G.
                  
WORST THOUGHT:    A headcrash on my harddisk ('cause I never do backups),

                  screens!)...

STATUS IN DF:     mainly soundchip music, but also coding and graphics

NORMAL STATE:     I'm usually too tired for any activity, so I have to
                  get a kick in my ass, if they want me to do something.

HAIR STYLE:       quite normal, I think. But did you know, that my Mum
                  cuts it, and she's no pro hairdresser?

LOOKS:            not bad actually...

HABITS:           using the buzztone-technique for the bassline of my
                  tunes maybe a bit too often...
                  When I'm bored, I usually load NeoMaster (Hey Spaztick,
                  Degas is bullshit!!!) and paint a bubble

FAVE SAYING:      "Oh Fuck" (yes, I know, it's actually not very original,

                  except for any Stock, Aitken & Waterman production.

HOBBIES:          Swimming, Skateboarding (although I'm not too good
                  at it), making a bit music with some friends...

                  on my beloved ST.

FAVE POSITION:    Sitting on the stairs holding the above mentioned girl
                  in my arms

FAVE COMPUTER:    Atari ST, although the Amiga is better, but I feel
                  actually more satisfied, if I manage to solve a problem
                  on ST, because I know it was more difficult.

FAVE BOOK:        Starwars Trilogy (Yes, it's because I haven't read any
                  book since ages. If I would have, my fave book might
                  be the Hitchhiker's Guide...)
