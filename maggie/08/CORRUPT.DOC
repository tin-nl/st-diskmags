
10:40pm 23/7/91    The Back room.  My house.       Mandy is here.

    Guess what? Yes, it's another adventure review. This time it is Corruption
and as I don't have much to say about it I will fill you with some Bullshit
first. If you just want to read the review skip to where it says CORRUPTION in
capital letters. Here is the Bullshit:
    Do you know what I did today?   Well, I went shopping at Clydebank with my
mum and two little brothers. I also went ten pin bowling but we had to have
cusions in the gutters of our lane because my smallest brother sulks if we
don't. I got some crap scores so I'd rather not talk about them. Let's talk
about Girls instead. Aren't there any female maggie readers out there?
Probably not because what Maggie 2 said about girls and computers is true. I
know two girls with computers and they both have Amigas! (There is a good side
to this: they wont read the Maggie and find out that I am writing about them
(Unless Dick tells them!(Don't you dare!))).
    The first example, which we shall call Miss X, has a brother who owns an
Amiga 500 and the only game she has bought is A Rock Ster Ate My Hamster. She
also likes AC/DC. Enough of that I think. The second example, Miss Y, also has
an Amiga 500 and swaps cracked games with Miss X's brother. Even worse, she is
good at them. Why these girls have Amigas I don't know. Maybe they are turned
on by external power supplys, noisy and slow disk drives and loading their
operating system from disk. (I personnally do not have anything against Amigas.
In fact, if you give me one for nothing I could get to like them (Only a A1500
or better though, the A500 is so ugly!))
    I am writing this in medium resolution and am having difficulty reading it
as I am using our television (My monitor is being repaired). I am still
listening to Eric Clapton and I think I will do that review now.

                             CORRUPTION
              Magnetic Scrolls         Reviewed and puzzled over by Tartiana

    This is a tradional text adventure with optional graphics. The control of
the game is the same as other magnetic scrolls games such as The Pawn and The
Guild Of Thieves. The parser is very good and the game is easy to use.
    The story is that you are Derek Rogers and you have just gone into
bussiness with your partner David Rodgers (The company is called Rodgers &
Rogers, confusing eh?). You suspect that your partner is corrupt and you have
to try and stop him getting you falsely arrested for fraud. Along the way you
will find that the company lawer, the police inspector and the owner of the
local unlicenced casino are also corrupt and that David is a drug dealer too
(You can even try some of his cocaine). Unfortunatly they are all out to get
you so I tried telling the police. They didn't understand when I showed them
Davids drugs and I lost my temper and hit the police man and was promptly
arrested.
    There are 200 possible points and so far I have scored 80 of them. The
game
area that I have discovered so far is the office building, the streets round
about containing the police station, restaurant, casino, pharmacy and the
park.
Ihave also found the hospital (when I tried to cross the road without the
traffic lights). I am sure there is more to the game but I am just to useless
to find the rest of it.
    There are pictures for most of the locations and the game works in colour
or mono. The graphics look very good on my colour monitor but I can't tell you
about what they look like in mono. There are two different text sizes and the
graphics can be turned off to save having to access the disk all the time.
There is no sound.
    Other functions include saving and loading games, using your printer and
hints. The hints are quite useful but using them is a pain. You have to type
out each hint in this wierd code and the program translates it for you. It is
best to write down the answers to save you having to type it out again.
    This game looks good and is really easy to use, the only problem being
that
I am no good at adventures. Look out for this game and both Fish and guild of
thieves all running under 'Magnetic windows' coming out as a compilation soon.
