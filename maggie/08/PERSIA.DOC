                    Review by Donatello of SPI

The Sultan of Persia has decided to take a few months off for his 
summer hols while he looks for new lands to conquer (nice way to 
spend your holdays). Anyway, he has left the running of the 
country to his daughter, the Princess of Persia. Unfortunately 
the Grand Vizier Jaffer (cake), who is quite a nasty piece of 
work, has decided that he would like to have a go at ruling 
Persia aswell. To do this he kidnaps, or should I say 
princessnaps the princess giving her the choice of either death 
or a fate worse than death (ie marrying him). She only has one 
hour to make up her mind, or die (gulp!). 
   Never fear (I hear you cry) the Prince of Persia is here! Well 
not quite, you see this Jaffer bloke has locked the Prince away 
in his darkest dungeon and also made him wear a really 
embarissing pare of pyjamas so he won't want to leave his cell 
for fear of people laughing at him and saying "look at that idiot 
in those stupid clothes!"
   Undetered by this our hero breaks out of his cell and sets off 
to rescue the Princess (who he obviously fancys a bit). 
   You begin the first level (known as level 1) with no weapon so 
your first objective is to find one. There is a sword right at 
the end of level one and to get to it you have to leap over gaps, 
spikes, and run through gates before they close. After you have 
the sword you then have to run all the way back again to the 
other end of the level and slice up the guard who will try to 
stop you getting throught the next level. You could of course try 
to face the guard before you got the sword but seeing as you are 
not Jackie Chan you would not stand much (any) chance. Once you 
have dealt the final blow to this guard you can proceed to the 
next and even more tricky level. On later levels you are 
presented with harder puzzles and extra bits and bobs desgined to 
stop you getting where you want to go. For example you come 
across a large, erm, slicey things are the best way to describe 
them, which will chop you clean in half if you are not carefull.
   To get around puzzles you have a number of moves open to you. 
To begin with you can either run (by pulling left or right) or 
walk (fire and left and right). Walking is very helpfull if you 
want to get right up to the edge of a gap before you make a jump. 
If you do this your sprite will take steps until he is quite close 
to the edge, then he will take a very little step to get right to 
the edge of the gap. If you try and make him walk off the edge he 
will not do so to begin with as he doesn't want to die very much. 
Jumping is another very good function. To get across gaps you can 
either jump from a standing position or take a running jump in 
which case you will go further. Also, if it is a very long jump 
which it doesn't look like you are going to make you can thrust 
up your arms and grab onto the ledge by your finger tips and then 
pull yourt self up. Real Indiana Jones stuff! Your sprite can do 
many other things but I'm not going to explain them all as it 
would take ages.
   Your energy is represented by three little triangles. If you 
fall too far you will lose one of the triangles, or if you fall a 
very long way then you will be killed completely. When facing an 
enemy you will automatically draw your sword (if you have one) 
and prepare to do battle. If your enemy hits you you will lose 
one triangle of energy. The enemys energy is also repesented in 
this way. Your can increase you amount of energy by finding 
potions which are hidden through out levels. Some potions will 
restore one triangle of energy, some will restore all energy and 
give you and extra triangle aswell, and some will poison you and 
make you lose energy.
   If you die you will be given the option to continue. If you 
deicide to continue then you will be placed at the start of the 
level you just got killed on. You can die any number of times and 
still return to try again, however, you only have 60 minutes to 
complete all 12 levels so if you lose more than a couple of lives 
you will have wasted too much time to finish the game. If the 60 
mins deplete before you have finshed all the levels then your 
game is over. 
   Incase you feel you cannot take playing a game for 60 minutes 
then don't worry because you can save the game at any time. This 
helps alot as you can load up you saved game, practice completing 
the level, and then re-load your saved game and continue playing. 
You can practice as much as you like and not worry about how much 
time you have as when you load the saved game again you will 
still have the amount of time you had when you saved it. Hmmm.. I 
don't think I explained that very well but who cares.

EFFECTS

The animation of the main character is absolutely stunning. He 
really does look like a real person running about on your screen. 
There a just so many frames of animation for everything he does, 
even things like putting his sword away! Unfortunately, because 
of this other things had to suffer. There is no real backround, 
it's nearly all black apart from the odd animated torch here and 
there. Also the screen doesn't scroll, when you leave one screen 
you appear at the start of the next, which can be a bit confusing 
at first. One last point which is probably the second most 
annoying feature of the game is the way your sprite slows down 
when something simple happens like a gate closing or when a 
slicer is slicing. Suprisingly you do not slow done too much when 
you are fighting a baddy, probably because less frames are used 
to animated your bloke when he's sword fighting. 
   You are played quite a nice atmospheric tune when the game 
first loads and spot effects are played through out the game 
which are also pretty good. The sound does not stand out as a 
major feature of the game though.

VERDICT

Prince of Persia is a very enjoyable game to play. When I bought 
it I played it non stop until I completed it, which was about 1-2 
weeks. It can be very annoying though when you get stuck on a 
level. The most annoying feature of the game is the way you are 
put right back at the start of the level when you die. This is 
necessary though as the game would be much too easy if you were 
re-incarnated exactly where you were killed. When you do get stuck 
you will find that the playability will start to slowly go. For 
example I got stuck on one of the levels (I think it was level 8), 
I kept dying right near the end of the level on some slicey 
things. I almost stopped playing it at this point but evently I 
got past this level and the playability came rushing back. It is 
well worth persevering with this game as you feel great when you 
finally finish it. However once I had completed the game I found I 
did not play it any more as I had worked out all the puzzles. Then 
I found that there were bits to levels that I hadn't seen before 
and this made be play it a bit more but it was not as enjoyable 
as when I had first got it. I can imagine that if you get stuck 
for a long time on a level then you will stop playing it after a 
while but this will mean that you can come back to it a few months 
later and still have new puzzles to solve unlike if you finish 
the game.
   I had to modify my rating system for this game as the 
playability changed quite alot.
