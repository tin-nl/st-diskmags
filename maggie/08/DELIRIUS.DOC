                         by THE ALLIANCE

A review by Leon O'Reilly
 
   This  is one demo that deserves the title 'Megademo',  it  is 
massive spanning two double sided disks. It is also referred to as
one of the all time classic ST demos. But is it really that good? 
With  the recent release of the European  demo,  the  Overlanders 
have  been  hailed  as THE crew to watch out  for  in  '91.  Leon 
O'Reilly  steps  back  in time and  examines  OVR's  first  major 
contribution to the demo scene.

     Inserting  Disk A into my drive I waited patiently  for  this 
demo to boot. Some bars appeared moving up then dropping back down 
again. Soon after this came the first real screen.
     This  is  simply  a picture  with  music,  no  scrolline,  no 
movement,  no sprites. The picture is of an alien (Probably one of 
the  Overlanders) and the music is a digi-synth tune.  It  doesn't 
sound anything like the current soundtracker music, it sounds more 
like the digisynth player Ghost of Phalanx use.  It isn't too  bad 
but as there is nothing else on this screen I assume it must  take 
up the majority of the processor time and the sound quality isn't 
that good!
     Lucky,  lucky,  lucky 1 meg owners get an extra screen here. 
In  the  background there is a starfield.  Some  David  Whittikar 
music  from  Speedball  plays.  In  the  middle  of  the  screen, 
displayed  in  a big font is the legend "THE  ALIANCE".  All  the 
letters in this logo rotate, spin and bounce. I assume it is this 
animation that takes up so much memory. 
     After this screen comes the main menu,  and compare to Union, 
Cuddly  or  Mindbomb it is pretty pathetic.  There is  a  scroller 
along  the bottom and on the top there are six boxes  representing 
the six members of the Alliance:
Clone, The Black Cats, M.C.S., Overlanders, Pendragons & Avalanche
In  the  middle of the screen is a triangle  with  balls  rotating 
round it.
Four hours later after bashing every key on the keyboard in  every 
possible combination and trashing three joysticks you realise that 
you control the main menu with the mouse.  Clicking on one of  the 
boxes brings up a sub-menu.
CLONE
They  just  give  one  screen,  though  it  is  rather  tasty  but 
personally I prefer their screen in the Black demo.
At the start of this screen a CLONE sprite with flashing red  eyes 
rises and then starts distorting. There is a scroller in the lower 
border.  In  the  bottom half of the screen is  a  barrel  roller 
showing the members of the alliance. On the top of the screen is a 
chequered landscape scroller. There are also disk drive light FX.
Overall a very nice screen.

THE BLACK CATS
They give two mediocre screens to this demo
TBC 1 (On Disk 2)
This  contains  lots of bars that spill into the  left  and  right 
borders,  a distorted ALLIANCE logo, a bouncing sprite bearing the 
legend "The Black Cats",  a vertical scroller showing the alliance 
members. There is a transparent scroller with the words:
"Alliance is number 1"
In the background, though it looks like "Alliance is number 7"
Two bouncing balls and disk drive FX complete this screen.

TBC 2 (On disk 2)
This  screen has more moving bars,  a big "The Black  Cats"  logo, 
bouncing ball sprites each with a letter of the ALLIANCE on them.
The is also a scroller, volume indicators and muzax from the union 
main menu.

M.C.S. (On disk 2)
They  only  give  one screen.  This includes a  big  flipping  MCS 
sprite, a very lame starfield, a distorting alliance logo, a lower 
border  scroller with a psychedelic font and Astaroth  music.  Nay 
bad.

OVERLANDERS
These  guys should be given the award for making the most  enemies 
in the shortest time.  People hate them for different reasons, but 
most  coders (especially French ones) seem to dislike  them.  They 
are  often referred to as Overlamers.  I think this is  unfair  as 
they  have done the majority of work on this demo,  and  over  the 
last two years have released more demos than anyone else.

OVR1-LANDSCAPE (On disk 2)
On this screen there is a huge spinning Overlanders logo,  a piccy 
of mountains and sky,  a message line,  a lower border transparent 
scroller with mountains and sky in the background.  My version  of 
this demo unfortunately crashes after this screen!

OVR2-OVERTOWN (On disk 2)
What a lame screen!  There is a nice picture of a futuristic town, 
some of this piccy spills into the left and right border. There is 
also a scroller.  That's it!  The scroller is very long! I gave up 
reading  it  as  I got bored,  and I usually  read  all  of  every 
scroller ever made - I even read all the scroller on the BIG demo!

OVR3-DANCING DEMO (On disk 2)
This demo is very good indeed.  There is a picture of two  massive 
HIFI  thingies,  an ST with two big microphones by it,  a  monitor 
with  a  mini scroller on it (Which says "Dancing  Demo  coded  by 
Epsilon  for  the  delirious  demo").  There  is  a  lower  border 
scroller,  a  fading  ALLIANCE logo,  two fujis which  are  volume 
indicators  and  the  piece de resistance is  a  blue  silhouetted 
figure.  She is obviously digitised, and she starts dancing to the 
music. The movement is incredibly realistic! Great screen!

OVR4-MEGA SCROLLER (On disk 1)
"Ladies  an  Gentleman this story is true.  The  names  have  been 
changed  to  protect the innocent." This sample  greets  you  when 
loading  this screen.  Another screen then appears and it is  very 
funny indeed. There is a very crap font which says:
the Replicants present leur demo
There is a jammed mouse pointer on the screen and beeps which have 
been  coded  on a Spectrum 48K.  Three bombs then appear  on  this 
screen. Lines appear and this screen fades. There is a sample:
"3, 2, 1, Zero"
There is a picture of a man and a robot.  The man has  'Replicant' 
on his sweatshirt. He says:
"Shit,  but we must be realistic,  Overlanders are better than  us 
!!!"
Robot, "It's the reason why we don't love you Overlanders"
Along  the  bottom of the screen is the scroller  which  has  many 
freaky effects which Peewee puts it through. Great screen.

OVR5-ZIGGY 1 (On disk 1)
This  screen contains a brilliant Hip-hop style Alliance  logo  in 
the middle of the screen.  That is the main feature of the screen. 
There are lots of ball sprites,  a message line in balls, a raster 
scroller,  a  fading  "The Overlander" logo and cuddly  main  menu 
tune.

OVR6-ZIGGY 2 (On disk 1)
A huge sprite "The Alliance For Ever" scrolls up.
There a ball sprites making up the words "Ziggy Stardust".
There  is  a  lower border cavern  with  scrolltext,  a  chequered 
landscape scroller with hills and ditches!  The music is from  the 
cuddly reset screen. 

OVR7-ZIGGY 3 (On disk 1)
This is also called the Nul-o-demo. There is a two layer scrolling 
background  which flips about,  a distorting flipping  Overlanders 
logo, scaling balls and a scrolline with a very nice font indeed.

OVR8-MISTER BEE (On disk 1)
In a window on the bottom of this screen you get digi-pics of some 
games  and sometimes digipics of Mister Bee (Pass the sick  bag!). 
At  the top there is a bouncing Mister Bee logo with moving  bars. 
There are also two bouncing smilies, a chinese font scroller and a 
smooth scrolling background.

That completes all the Overlanders screens, none are stunning, but 
they are all worth seeing.

PENDRAGONS
These hard workers give six (Count 'em!) screens.

PEN 1 (On disk 2)
There is a pendragons logo through which a raster moves.  There is 
a piccy of Darth Vader,  or should I say Anakin Skywalker? This is 
a 3D vector screen rather like the one in Phalanx's demo, only its 
a  lot better.  By pressing keys A - P you get  different  objects 
which you can manipulate using the function keys - Spin 'em,  move 
'em, Shrink 'em, Bum 'em etc.
The shapes you've got include a Fuji,  ATARI ST,  PENDRAGONS,  Tie 
fighter, Disk, ALLIANCE, Volume bars/pyramids.
Hours on fun for all the family.

PEN 2 (On disk 2)
The  first  thing you notice on this screen is  David  Whittikar's 
infamous Speedball mussixxx (With 3 X's).  There is a raster logo, 
some  green ball sprites,  a nice chequered landscape which  moves 
and  a  low scroller.  I couldn't work out whether it was  in  the 
border  or not as I had been pissing about with all the knobs  (!) 
on my Philips monitor!

PEN 3 (On disk 2)
There  are  some volume bars along the bottom of this  screen  and 
they indicate the volume!  There are also some fast moving  balls, 
disk drive FX,  a bouncing scroller,  lotsa colours, sprite scales 
from  distance,  a moving chequered landscape with a road and  two 
sides (Sort of). Good zkreem.

PEN 4
You need 1 meg for this humungous screen.
Once  loaded the first thing you notice are the upper  and  lower 
borders.  Or maybe you don't notice them,  as they aren't  there. 
There  is  a volume indicator in the middle of the  screen  which 
flashes to a soundchip tune as do the diskdrive lights. Four tiny 
triangular sprites bounce up and down the screen.  In the  bottom 
border there is a bouncing scroller. 
     The main feature of this demo in the top half of the screen. 
Here  there is a panel of the screen which you can  control  with 
the following keys:
F1/F2 - Amplitude
F3/F4 - Period
F5/F6 - Speed
F7/F8 - Scroll side A
F9/F10 -Scroll side B 
'1'/'2'-Control panel
     This  allows you to mess about with an area of  the  screen, 
flipping it about and scrolling it up and down!  Lots of fun  for 
everyone in a big yellow delirious demo!

PEN 5 (On disk 2)
Horrid font scroller bounces along the bottom border,  there is an 
Alliance  symbol  sprite  distorter,  bouncing  crystal  balls,  a 
message line with TCB font and disk drive FX.  

PEN 6 (On disk 2)
This is a good 'un.  First of all we have disk drive FX,  a  lower 
border  scroll,  big moving background,  lots of  little  Alliance 
logos  scroll up the screen,  3 level mountains  parallax  scroll 
along the top and bottom of this screen,  4 big balls bounce about 
and some tiny balls bounce in a circle.
One of the best screens on the demo!

AVALANCHE 
There is a very fast scroller with a Union Jack font in the middle 
of  the screen.  There is also an Avalanche logo.  At the top  and 
bottom of the screen there are chequered landscape  scrollers.  On 
the bottom landscape are the names of the  coders,  Yeti,  Snowman 
and Grizzly. Not a bad 'un.

GRAPHICS:      8
SOUND:         6
AMOUNT ON DISK:8
CODING:        7.5
OVERALL:       7.5

The Overlanders have improved a lot since this, but it is a worthy
addition to your collection. More is expected from demos today!
