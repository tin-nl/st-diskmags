Name:  Darkman

Real Name:  David Thomson

Height:  About 5 foot 10 inches

Weight:  Dunno, but I'm not heavy enough (especially when you consider the
         amount of stuff I eat)

Hair:  Can't find a mirror just now

Fave Clothes:  Normally jeans and a t-shirt

Job:  I'm too young to work

Status in T-deF:  Like I said, I'm too young to work

Normal State:  Eating and Sleeping (but not at the same time (usually))

Fave Position:  Umm, let's just say it's 'a lot of fun, but not very comfy' and
                be done with it, OK?

Fave Girl:  The one in MacDonalds with the (open-top) karate suit (yup,yup,yup)
            and Michelle Pfeiffer (fnar! Dream On Matey!)

             Naked Gun 1 & 2.5 , Silence of the Lambs , most Spielberg stuff

Worst Book:  Lord of the Flies definitely.  I was forced to read it for my 
             English exam and it was so shit I couldn't believe it.  In the 
             end I used The Dark Half by Stephen King.

Worst Film:  Half of the Police Academy Series , the Superman series , and
             a helluva lot of other ones that I can't remember the names of

            Scorcher becasue it's bloody brilliant!!

Worst Demo:  Phantom of the Opera by some guy called Hurricane or Trax or
             something.  I don't even like Heavy Metal but this was bloody

Fave Game:  Wings of Death is about 20 zillion times better than Xenon 2,
            Enchanted Lands is amazingly brilliant , The Killing Game Show is
