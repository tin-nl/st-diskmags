     On this disk you should find an excellent picture ripping program. 
When you first of all look at it, it is hard to believe that it was in 
fact coded in GFA Version 2. The idea for this first came about when I 
received a copy of Cracking Graph written by Black Angel. Cracking graph 
allowed you to load in a program and search through it looking for degas 
.PI1 pictures. Unfortunately you could not save the picture once you had 
found it, unless you had Multiface (which is complete shit, don't buy 
it!), or similar. The Doc file said to use a screen saving utility, but 
none of the ones we tried worked. So, my friend decided he would code 
something similar to Cracking Graph, but improve it in many ways. I 
pessimistically told him that he was being stupid, because he would 
not be able to do it, because he had never programmed anything before. 
Half an hour later he presented me with a copy of Camera Version 1. It 
was a very simple piece of software, but it was reliable and did it's job 
well. I congratulated him and apologised for my lack of confidence in 
him. Since then Camera has gone through many improvements. The first 
version allowed you to scroll through a program and save any picture you 
found. You were then asked whether you wanted the default palette or the 
picture palette. Now, with Camera Version 1.4 you can save the colours 
the picture is in at the time of saving, change screen resolution, toggle 
between 50hz and 60hz, change screen width, delete a file and even format 
a disk. All this using GFA Version 2 and it's free with Maggie 7. What 
more can you ask for? More versions? Easy, just send œ5.00 registration 
fee to the address shown in Camera.Doc and you can receive Camera Version 
2.0 and any further updates. We ask you to supply your own disk and 
postage. I have already seen Camera Version 2.0 and I can assure you, it 
is very good. It will only be available to subscibers, as will any other 
updates. At the moment, it is only possible to rip degas .pi1 pictures, 
but the author hopes to change this soon. There may even be a little tune 
playing away while you rip in further versions! I have found Camera very 
useful for ripping graphics from Maggie, Automation menus, etc, etc . . . 
Picture disks are available from me at the bargain price of œ2.00. At the 
moment there are only 2 disks available, but more are being compiled at 
this very moment. They feature pictures from intros and games including 
Gremlins 2, After The War and Shadow of The Beast. All pictures are in 
degas .pi1 format. I also have an intro compilation disk available at the 
same price. Again, I ask you to supply a disk and mailing costs. Whoever 
said advertising costs money was wrong! If you would like to purchase 
these disks from me, please write to me at :

see a doctor or a psychiatrist. 

Never let it be said that I am a biased bloke. I have given Camera a well 
deserved plug, so now it's time to plug Ripper 3.1 by New Mode of Delta 
Force. Sammy Joe of TLB sent me this piece of software about a week ago. 
At first I was a bit apprehensive about it, but now it is a vital part of 
my software collection. The first thing you have to get used to is the 
fact that it was written on a German keyboard. This is O.K. if you have a 
German keyboard, but a bit annoying if, like me, you have an English  
keyboard. This little bug just swaps the 'Y' and 'Z' keys around. Once 
you get used to it, it is no problem. The other bug is the non-
compatibility with the STE. It still works, but the screen is affected. 
     Ripper is bootsector driven, which enables you to scroll through 
memory rather than a program. It is activated by simply pressing the 
reset button. This effectively means that you can rip from almost any 
game or demo. Obviously, it is a problem if the demo has a reset demo! I 
have already managed to rip pictures from B.I.G. Demo, Whattaheck Demo, 
and various commercial titles. It works on the same principle as Camera, 
but of course it is bootsector driven. You can also choose the palette 
using Ripper, but this can sometimes be a long and sometimes difficult 
process. We once spent over half an hour trying to get the right 
palette for the title picture for Shadow of The Beast! It also saves in 
.NEO format, which takes up more room than a .pi1 picture. I wonder why 
it saves in Neochrome format? New Mode must know the author of Neochrome 
or something! Well that's about it for this review. All we have to do now 
is the summaries.
