     This  game  was lend to us by Funny Bits Software  based  in 
Stuttgart.  This  is probably the cheapest games shop  you  could 
find.  To have a look at the full list,  read the advert in  this 
Maggie. They also sell hardware.

     First  of  all  you  should know  that  this  game  needs  1 
megabyte,  a  double  sided  drive (a harddisk  would  be  a  lot 
better) and a colour monitor. 

     Remember this game on the gold old Commodore 64 ?  Well,  if 
you  liked  Silent Service,  your are just going to  love  Silent 
Service II.  They have included so many more features and  extras 
which make the game even more playable.

     The game starts off with a little test to see whether or not 
you have the manual. You are asked to identify a ship. This might 
be  a problem for people who own the German manual,  because  the 
ship names in the manual are in German and the entire program  is 
in  English.  It might be that you have to get out a  dictionary. 
Anyway,  after  having passed the test successfully you can  then 
choose a sub.  Some of the subs have 2 deck guns, some are faster 
and  some are slower (quite logical really!!).  Later on you  can 
choose  whether you want historical torpedoes (they don't  always 
work) or if you want to use flawless ones which always work.  You 
must also set the date at which you want to enter the war and you 
must also define where you want to search for your enemies.

     While cruising about CINPAC always informs you what is going 
on in the war,   i.e.  which ships have been sunk,  whose  troops 
have been defeated.  Most of the time the messages say  something 
like  "Guide your future operations accordingly".  Let's say  for 
example   that  some  troops  have  landed  in   northern   Luzon 
(Phillipines).  If  you  go there as fast possible you  are  very 
likely to encounter some troop ships. 

     The  computer will start you off on a map on which  you  can 
make  out how many ships you must fight.  In this case  there  is 
often  only one large ship which means that you can  surface.  If 
you  then  go  to  deck gun (F4) you can  use  Y  (Z  on  English 
keyboards) to zoom in on the ship.  If you then press B a picture 
of a ship will appear at the bottom of the screen. You can rotate 
the ship around with the cursor keys or you can go onto the  next 
ship also with the cursor keys. When you have reached the correct 
ship  the  computer  will  tell you.  You  can  fire  long  range 
torpedoes  at the sheep from 9 000 feets away,  but keep in  mind 
that  the chance of hitting is very little at this  distance  and 
that you have only got 6 torpedoes in the front. 

     The  graffix have improved a lot from  Silent  Service.  The 
enemy  ships are far more detailed,  the game play is  closer  to 
reality and the sound is marvellous.  Throughout the entire  game 
are samples,  i.e. for firing a torpedoe, for diving and when you 
are on the sonar of Japanese destroyers. 

     The game has a few draw backs too. As everything in the game 
is realtime calculated,  the program code is not fast enough,  so 
do  not  press they keys to often,  because it always  takes  the 
program a while to update the screen again.  Another minus is the 
continuous  loading.  The game has to re-load every single  piece 
of  graffix  or text.  If you have not got a  harddisk  it  might 
become quite annoying after a while,  but this does not mean that 
you must have a harddisk to play the game !!! 

     That's  about  all I have to say about the game  apart  from 
that there are many many different ship for you to sink.  Ohh,  I 
just love this game. Here's the summary:
