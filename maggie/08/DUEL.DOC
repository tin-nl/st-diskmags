This one has actually been around for some time now,  but we think 
it ought to be reviewed,  in order to see how it compares with the 
latest  glut  of  racing games,  especially the ones  reviewed  in 
previous issues of MAGGIE...

To  commence,  this  is  an American product,  written  before  US 
softco's started to give up on the ST,  and treat the Amiga like a 
runty cut-down PC compatible without an intel 80xxx CPU...

The  start-up  sequences  are very slick  and  smoothly  presented 
indeed,  including some very good graphix,  and sampled sounds and 
music,  and  still stands as an object lesson to most other people 
as  to  how  to  introduce a game...  You are given  a  choice  of 
vehicles,  Porsche,  or  Ferrari,  landscapes  (with the option of 
adding further scenery disks) level of expertise,  and off you go, 
after  being  given the choice of a race against the clock,  or  a 
computer controlled opponent...

To  the  game  itself,  the traditional first-person  'behind  the 
wheel'  viewpoint  is used,  the car dashboard is more  attractive 
than  most,  the track and other vehicles seem to be a little two-
dimensional  though,...  There is an authentic,  working rear-view 
mirror,  needed  to  keep an eye out for police vehicles (You  are 
working  to  the U.S.  speed limit of 55mph,  and are exceeding it 
considerably most of the time..) Such things as fuel stops have to 
be considered,  otherwise you run out,  and are faced with 'a long 
walk to the gas station' (Have a nice day???) On later levels, the 
police  get  meaner,  so you have to keep an eye on the radar  gun 
detector  meter,  and  there are cliffs,  and bottomless chasms to 
avoid...

At  the  time of writing this,  I have yet to complete a race,  as 
playing on the experts level (Of course!) I kept blowing the engine 
(Of course!!!), but this is a reasonable racer, no worse than more 
recent releases, and in certain cases, a bit better...

RATINGZZZZ:-

GRAPHIX:-  80% - Start-up and title sequences superb,  the in-game 
graphix adequate.. Nice dashboard.....

SONIX:- 80% - some excellent samples at the beginning,  and engine 
noises (Of a sort..) in the game itself...

PLAYABILITY:- 70% - I played this with joystick, and on this mode, 
the  handling of the vehicle leaves a little to be desired,  it is 
possible to keep going,  but you need the whole road to do it (And 
there is two-way traffic...)

OVERALL:- 74% - Oldish racing game,  classier than average, but in 
the  vital  area of gameplay,  nothing to distinguish it from  the 
other  one million and forty-two examples of the genre,  get it if 
you like it....
