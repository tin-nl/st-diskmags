  Hi again!!  First, let me say a big thank you to Sammy Joe who, since you are
reading this, has obviously decided to include this in Maggie!!

  Right, there isn't really much to say about the source, since it has quite a
lot of remarks (well, quite a lot from my point of view!).  Basically, all it
does is read some data stuff and then plots 15 sprites of the appropriate size
and in the appropriate positions.  Pretty simple really.  The music was taken
from Skate Tribe (I think) and has about 25 tunes in it.  It would be quite
easy to make this screen much better...

     - Logic screen plotting allowing for more bubbles (but also slowing the
       screen down)
     - A nice background picture
     - Different types of sprites (there are 7 different sizes of sprites.
       Examine the sprite bank to see which order they are in)
     - Better music (really hard to implement)

  I have nothing more to say on this subject since I am now a retired STOS
programmer.
