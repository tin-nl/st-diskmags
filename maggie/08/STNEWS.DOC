                       RICHARD KARSMAKERS
                       ------------------

NAME:             Cronos   Warchild  of  the   Amazing   Cracking 
                  Conspiracy of the Quartermass Experiment

REAL NAME:        Richard Karsmakers

AGE:              23

SEX:              Male

HEIGHT:           1.87

WEIGHT:           86

STATUS IN TLB:    Nothing whatsoever.

NORMAL STATE:     I  am not sure I get this.  Whenever I have  to 
                  fill in this question in any official papers  I 
                  have to fill in 'not married'. So there.
                  
HAIR STYLE:       Short. Quite very.

LOOKS:            I'd  like to think I'm a hunk but  I'm  not.  I 
                  have fucking glasses and I'm too fat.

HABITS:           Biting  my nails.  Only talking about  viruses, 
                  bootsectors in general and ST NEWS.
                                    
FAVE SAYING:      Anything   contained   words   like    'eerie', 
                  'eldritch' or 'obliterating'.  Most of the time 
                  I   can't  think  of  much  else  rather   than 
                  'indeed'.

FAVE JOKE:        To a German: Sie haben etwas verloren (you lost 
                  something. The German: Was? (What?). Reply: The 
                  war (Den Krieg).  This should be followed by  a 
                  heavy  sarcastic  laugh.  If the  German  is  a 
                  person the size of Erik Simon or Klaus of  TRB, 
                  you should run immediately afterwards.
                  
CLOTHES:          Jeans.  When hot:  Shorts. Shirts. Unbelievably 
                  horny underwear (well,  so my late  grandmother 
                  used to think).

MUSIC TASTES:     A lot,  but within boundaries.  Basically  good 
                  heavy  metal,  some death stuff,  synth  stuff. 
                  Names:   Metallica,   Queensryche,   Malmsteen, 
                  Satriani, Obituary.

HOBBIES:          Writing basic stuff and anything English.
   
FAVE FOOD:        Spaghetti  or  Chinese  (that  we  call   'Babi 
                  Pangang').

FAVE DRINKS:      Plain  Coke - even though my  weight  sometimes 
                  forces me to C. Light.
                  
FAVE GIRL:        Let  me  take my wallet and leaf  through  some 
                  pictures  and phone numbers there.  I  have  Bo 
                  Derek....too   flat.    Brooke   Shields....too 
                  Christopher Atkins.  Rachel Ward...too  thorny. 
                  Well, I guess I'd have to pick for Miranda.

FAVE POSITION:    Under. She doesn't like it, though.

FAVE COMPUTER:    In my dreams:  NEXT Cube.  In reality:  My very 
                  own Atari MEGA2 (with 4 meg,  harddisk built in 
                  and "AT Speed"!)

FAVE BOOK:        At the moment: Dragonlance Chronicles.

FAVE TV PROG:     It's  in summer recess  now:  "Medisch  Centrum 
                  West". I also kinda like "'Allo 'Allo".
                  
WORST TV PROG:    Anything  on MTV except for anything  heavy  or 
                  the clip of "Justify my love" (with the  volume 
                  nihilated).

BEST FILM:        "Dances  with  Wolves".   Please  allow  for  a 
                  runner-up (two,  actually):  "Abyss" and "Total 
                  Recall".  I  have not seen "Terminator  II"  or 
                  "Hudson Hawk" yet.

WORST FILM:       Anything with "Ooze", "Heroes in a Nutshell".

BEST NIGHT OUT:   The   evening   I  went  to  London   Horse   & 
                  Annihilator  &  Onslaught with  Steve  Bak  and 
                  Stefan.

BEST CONCERT:     Queensr˜che "Empire Tour" 1990.  I have not yet 
                  been to Metallica and Queensr˜che (and ACDC and 
                  Black  Crows) on September 1st which is  likely 
                  to get first then.

FAVE GAME:        Lemmings.

WORST GAME:       Schoolyard  Slaughter.  No.  That was  actually 
                  extremely funny. So I'd take Awesome.

FAVE VIRUS:       The Kobold #2 one. What a f.cker!

FAVE DEMO CREW:   The Overlanders.

WORST DEMO CREW:  After "Things not to do", without a doubt Inner 
                  Circle.  I do not say this because I happen  to 
                  know TLB.

BEST DEMO:        Union Demo.
                  
WORST THOUGHT:    The ST is dying.

NOTE FROM SPAZ:   He'd better not or I am not responsible for any 
                  of the answers above.

                    to sleep"

FAVE JOKE:          Not a joke really,  but taken from a comic by 
                    Eric Schreurs,  one of the most abusive Dutch 
                    comic book writers.

                    A man walks into a room where there is a baby 
                    lying on the ground.  A really adorable  baby 
                    that says "bibi" all the time.  The guy walks 
                    up to the baby,  looks at it for a while  and 
                    then sits down on it. (splat!)
                    He looks around a little, with the struggling 
                    baby under him.
                    After a while he says:
                    "Pretty neat, this babysitting"

CLOTHES:            Usually  a gathering of jeans,  T-shirts  and 
                    trainers,   that  I  found  lying  around  my 
                    appartment somewhere.
                  
MUSIC TASTES:       Everything really,  from Carcass to  Gandalf, 
                    but  lately I have been in gothic stuff  like 
                    the  Sister  of Mercy and the Fields  of  the 
                    Nephilim.

HOBBIES:            Lying on the sofa while watching some  video, 
                    pondering the meaning of life,  drinking beer 
                    in the meantime.
   
FAVE FOOD:          Japanese stuff (no raw fish though!!!) 

FAVE DRINKS:        PLANTIAC!  (of course) I like Tia Maria  too, 
                    but  I  have been told that  only  women  and 
                    queers drink this stuff. Well, I don't give a 
                    shit.
                  
FAVE GIRL:          Natanga

FAVE POSITION:      Sortof horizontal I guess,  depends on what I 
                    have in my hands, who I am with and wheter or 
                    not I have any clothes on.

FAVE COMPUTER:      The remote control of my VCR.

FAVE BOOK:          Loads  and  loads of them.  I  just  got  the 
                    Necronomicon, who knows what will happen now. 
                    Check out "American Psycho" too....

FAVE TV PROG:       "Married with Children". I would like to have 
                    some serious intercourse with Kelly Bundy  of 
                    course.
                  
WORST TV PROG:      Most of it is crap,  all of it really, if you 
                    think about it. I hardly watch TV.

BEST FILM:          TERMINATOR II!!!!!!!!!
                    This  film is slightly insanely  unbelievable 
                    and  you  just have to see it to  believe  it 
                    really. Arnie rules!!

WORST FILM:         "Fingered" by Richard Kern with Lydia Lunch.
                    "FUCK!"

BEST NIGHT OUT:     The New Year parties in ™rsta, Norway. It was 
                    heaven to be honest. When I die, I want to go 
                    to the eternal New Year celebration in ™rsta, 
                    Norway.

BEST CONCERT:       I  hardly  go  to concerts,  but  I  saw  the 
                    Sisters of Mercy recently and that was rather 
                    mind expanding to say the least.

FAVE GAME:          Llamatron by Jeff Minter,  Yak the Hairy  did 
                    it again!!!

WORST GAME:         Holy  shit,  there  are so  many  crap  games 
                    around  that when I mention  them  all,  this 
                    issue would need some very good packer.

FAVE VIRUS:         What  was the virus Marc  did??  Megacunt  or 
                    something? Brilliant!!

FAVE DEMO CREW:     ALCOHOLICA!!!!

WORST DEMO CREW:    Well,  who shall I give the honor? Alcoholica 
                    maybe? Dunno, TCB perhaps??? Naah...

BEST DEMO:          A  lot of people are mentioning  their  demos 
                    now.  Ermm....  I don't know,  it hasn't been 
                    made yet and never will sortof.
                  
WORST THOUGHT:      Having  to  clean  the toilets  here  at  the 
                    DeltaForce convention. BLLEEUUURRRHHHGGG!!!

NOTE FROM SPAZ:     Don't  you  dare!!!   You  will  be  severely 
                    spanked by daddy!
