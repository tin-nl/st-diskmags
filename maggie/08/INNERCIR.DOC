You  will all remember the Inner Circle's great DECADE DEMO,  (and 
probably remember 'Griff's Column'...) Now they are back, with two 
new  disks,  and these are a prelude to their Autumn  Blockbuster, 
the two-disk 'Genetix Demo'

The first and wackiest, is the:-

                     THINGS NOT TO DO DEMO....

This is a series of eight short animations which describe  certain 
situations, and the gruesome, gore-splattered outcome... This demo 
has everything, Kung-Fu, chainsaws, severed arteries, DEATH! High-
powered  assault  rifles,  a  great  Count  Zero  digi-soundtrack, 
flamethrowers, more DEATH! a three-dimensional starfield that goes 
off  in all directions,  and a whole bunch of greets for different 
people, including the Lost Boys, (And yet more DEATH!!)

The  demo  is  one which is left to run,  as  the  animations  are 
interspersed  with  the  starfield and  scrolly  bits,  the  first 
animation is where the Kung-Fu master attempts to head-butt a load 
of tiles,  and only succeeds in getting a broken,  bloody nose for 
his trouble!!  It then gets a great deal worse from there, but you 
will have to get the disk to find out, as I think it is a shame to 
give  anymore  away....  This  is one for people of  a  very  sick 
disposition, and can safely be recommended to Maggie readers..

Graphically,  very good 'cartoony' style,  and there are two great 
Quartet soundtracks by Count Zero....  Overall,  an excellent, and 
dare I say it??  entertaining demo, well worth a place in anyone's 
collection....

The second disk contains:-

                       THE LITTLE MUSIC DEMO...

This one is a co-production between the Inner Circle, and two guys 
representing SONIC PROJECTS, who produced the soundtracks...

This  demo  is One meg and above only,  and on loading,  there  is 
nothing  much to look at,  just a screen giving the details of the 
people involved in its production, and a description of the MODule 
name and function key.... It uses a tracker routine to play them , 
adapted  from  an Amiga version,  and is not very  spectacular  in 
terms of quality, but the tunes themselves are amongst THE BEST IN 
ANY  FORMAT,  and  are excellent,  included are things such as yet 
another  THALAMUS remix,  and a whole bunch of new tunes,  some of 
which are quite understated and refreshing,  all of them are worth 
listening through to the end, I hope we can get to hear a lot more 
from the Guys at SONIC PROJECTS....

This  is clearly recommended for all music lovers,  and is one  to 
bung through the Hi-Fi if you have the means to connect it to your 
computer....

Both  disks  are available from our pals at  Riverdene  PDL  (Disk 
no's 933 and 934..)

So it is nice to hear from the Inner Circle again,  and we eagerly 
anticipate their next mega-demo. later in the year...

(Funny,  isn't it, how the lead times for new demos get longer and 
longer, there was a time when you couldn't go five minutes without 
a  new release smacking you in the gob,  but I suppose as they get 
better,  there is more work involved,  which takes more time,  The 
new  Lost Boys Demo is truly awe-inspiring,  and more than a  year 
after the Mindbomb, which seems to illustrate the point...)

STOP  PRESS:- Apologies,  I should have read the greets screen  at 
the  end earlier,  the second tune is courtesy of an Amiga  group, 
ANARCHY, and not Count Zero after all..

All for now CIH (C) 10/8/91...
