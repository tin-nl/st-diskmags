                         Mr.  Bob was having problems.  Not  only 
was  he  boss of a construction firm so big that he  made  Alfred 
McAlpine's hardware look like kid's toys, there were things going 
missing from his construction site. It wasn't just money that was 
being  stolen,  pickaxes,  shovels,  hammers  and all  the  other 
important tools were being nicked by the creatures of the  forest 
affectionately   known  as  the  'Mad  Meanies'.   This  was   an 
unprecedented  event  -  usually the  meanies  stayed  away  from 
Tintown  (a  gleaming metropolis in the  heart  of  fluffyworld). 
They  normally  just  stole birds eggs  or  sang  Chesney  Hawkes 
records.  But  something has stirred them up and they are out  on 
the  rampage stealing anything not nailed down,  and even  things 
that  are.  Fortunately,  ever city near the 'big forest'  had  a 
'Beastie   Buster'  and  'Leroy'  was  the  best  one  of   these 
around. Mr.  Bob  had only one course of action and that  was  to 
hire Leroy to exterminate these pests for good.
     You  take control of Mr.  Bob and have to examine  financial 
forecasts,  hire  construction equipment,  test  traffic  lights, 
supervise  dumping  and bridge construction and  make  sure  your 
workers don't spend too long on their tea breaks.
     Well,  not quite.  Actually,  you control Leroy the Beastie 
Buster and have to rid many levels of mad meanies.  Each level is 
a  construction site  with various platforms  which  the  meanies 
clamber across. These platforms come in two different types:
Horizontal - These are your standard 'Joe Average'  type of  walk 
             wherever you want platforms.
Diagonal   - These are the super-deluxe platforms. You can't stop 
             on  them  otherwise  you  will  just  slide  to  the 
             bottom. These can be very annoying!
     The  other type of platforms - platform shoes -  fortunately 
aren't featured in this game.

     Each  level is relatively small,  and you just have to  kill 
all  the meanies on it.  This is done by shooting them with  your 
airgun  when  you are in close proximity of them.  This  isn't  a 
standard airgun,  it is more like a bicycle pump.  You fire  fire 
once to stun the meanie, then fire repeatedly and the meanie will 
fill with air and expand.  Once he's full he will begin to  float 
up  the screen.  By jumping into him you can push him  along  the 
screen killing any other meanies in his flight path.
     Once  all the meanies have been dealt with you  progress  to 
the  next  level.  On the first few levels you  get  pretty  lame 
adversaries - slow and unarmed.  Even Amiga owners could get past 
these,  but  things  quickly hot up.  Rabid apes race  round  the 
platforms  an  their pressure hammers and mutant birds  lay  eggs 
that  explode in your face.  While on even later levels  you  get 
meanies that spit on you and apes that throw deadly barrels  down 
the platforms a la Donkey Kong. And I'm sure there are even worse 
creatures  if you get further into the game (I haven't  got  that 
far yet...).
     
     The  graphics  throughout the game are of  a  high  quality, 
nothing  that'll  make your granny want to buy an  ST,  but  they 
possess a resounding cuteness that ties in with the theme of  the 
game.  The  Monster business logo is  particularly  amusing.  The 
sprites  move  smoothly and quickly round the  screen  even  when 
there  a  millions of them on screen  (well,  almost  millions!).
The  backgrounds  are quite dull but the platforms are  the  most 
accurate  representation of a construction site yet seen  on  the 
ST.  Scrolling seems smooth and fast enough though this game does 
only  scroll  vertically and its obviously not doing it  all  the 
time.   This  game  follows  the  recent  trend  of  games   with 
microscopic  status panels so the action takes up nearly  all  of 
the screen (like GODS).  The status panel in Monster Business  is 
only a few pixels high so you have a large screen area.
     Sound  should  get a special mention.  It consists  of  many 
hippelesque  tunes  which combine standard soundchip  music  with 
digidrums  and  digibass.  If you've heard the in-game  music  in 
Turrican  or Ninja Remix you know what to expect.  Each  tune  is 
absolutely  excellent!  The  most surprising thing is  that  they 
weren't  mad  by  old  Mad  Max as  they  sound  similar  to  his 
creations.   I   can  guarantee  these  tunes  will   be   making 
appearances in many demoscreens in the near future!      

     I only have a couple of minor niggles about this  game.  The 
first thing is the dying sequence,  it's awful. You explode which 
is fair enough but then a tiny purple angel sprite floats up  the 
screen,  if this sprite isn't bad enough you are greeted with the 
worst piece of soundchip music I've ever heard!  OK,  it's only a 
few  seconds  long  but  it still enough  to  drive  you  insane, 
especially after the agony of running out of time on a level when 
you were just pumping up the last meanie!
     Also it would be useful if the status panel showed just  how 
many  meanies were left in the level so you could  time  yourself 
correctly. This feature is not essential but would be useful.
     I  think the programmers overlooked one major feature  which 
would  really  enhance  this game's playability  and  that  is  a 
password system.  It is annoying to start at level one  everytime 
you load up the game.  The continue systems helps but a  password 
system would've been the obvious solution.

     This  game contains that magic ingredients that elevates  it 
to a classic status,  it has that 'one more go and I'll  complete 
that  level'  addictiveness.  It's  not a game  that  you'd  play 
solidly  for consecutive hours,  but it is a game that  you  will 
return  to  again and again.  It is similar to bubble  bobble  in 
concept  and retains all the greatness of the best cute games  on 
the market.  It has the appeal of Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands, 
New  Zealand et al but with the addition of  fantastic  sound.  I 
feel   the  gameplay  is  pitched  slightly  more   towards   the 
experienced gamesplayer and that is a good thing as it gives  the 
game lasting appeal.
     Overall  this  is  a  game  that  should  be  in  everyone's 
collection  whether  you  like platform  games  or  not.  It  has 
everything you could want from a game;  it's well programmed, has 
good  sound  and graphics and above all  it  is  addictive.  It's 
everything  'A Prehistoric Tale' should've been but  wasn't.  The 
Lost  Boys  have  finally produced a game that lives  up  to  the 
reputation created by their demos.
