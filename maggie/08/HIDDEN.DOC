
              THE FIRST HIDDEN SECTION OF MAGGIE 8
                              BY FRANK SCHMIDT & MICHAEL 
                                        (HI, I AM GERMAN !!!!!)


     Se  German  Skool  is  a high  sekurity  prison  ("  viewing 
strictly by appointment " as se nicked sign in my room says!!!"). 

     NEWSFLASH:  shock, horror, disgust !!! A prisoner managed to 
escape  from Fort Knox II,  se German Skool.  Michael  Schuessler 
simply said to se prison Head:  " Fuck you man,  I am leaving !".  
Two  dayz later se Head could not find Michael S.  in se  smoking 
corner but instead found se secret formular wiz which Michael  S. 
managed to escape, it read:


   Bad marks + shitty girls + crappy wardens 
 --------------------------------------------- = I'm outa here
       (uncomfy stools * no speeding)  

     5  days  later Frank Schmidt tried se  same  formular  after 
having  helped to design it,  but got stuck in se smoking  corner 
'cause  of  new security precausions (free fags !!)  and  ser  he 
lived unhappily ever after. 

     Meanwhile se search for Michael S. was disgus(t)sed at Prime 
Ministers Question Time.  Kinnibaby accused se Prime Minister  of 
fraud  inside  se  security system (Michael  S.also  supplied  se 
wardens wiz good quality  condoms from Easty Germaniac). The 1 PM 
(wats se time again????) waz lost for vords and could only reply:
"I  sink  I   should  point  out  sat  mei  right honourabl frend 
(-->Kinnibaby)  has overseen se fakt sat his  homosexual  affairs 
wiz  Sir Jeffry How cannot be overseen in sis case.  Serefore  I 
would  advise him to hold se mouth (Quote from se  prison  warden 
Fast Forward).       

     Later  on  Michael  S.  claimed political  assylum  in  WEST 
Germany (pronounciation on WEST ,  Stuttgart).  He lived  happily 
ever after (god, wats sat brown stuff ??) in:

                    Michael Schuessler
                    Seestrasse 34/II
                    7254 Hemmingen
                    WEST Germany
                    Tel.: 07150 8447.

Se formula he came up wiz for his nieu life reads as follows:


             (Good Bier / nice GIRLS)
             ------------------------
    (Tscheep Discos - comfy chairs) *  FIAT PANDA
--------------------------------------------------= Sis is GREAT!      
                   Good Marks


     Ah  well,  that's  enough  of that  bullshit.  As  you  have 
probably  gathered by the text above I am now living in  Germany. 
DO NOT write to my English address any more.  Currently I have  6 
days  left here in England and Frank and I are just sitting  here 
drinking tea (Yes,  you heard right,  I did not say beer,  we are 
actually  drinking  tea) and  smoking  cigarettes.  You  probably 
remember  that Frank S.  was one of the guys to whom I  dedicated 
Maggie 7 !! And now over to Frank S. Radio Station :

     Do you know what my deepest phantasy is?
     I love two hard cocks.  I like to have one fucking me and  I 
like to suck one up while the other one is fucking me... (this is 
what  one  of the girls is saying on my  tape:THE  FRANK  SCHMIDT 
RADIO STATION I would not want you to think I am gay),
Michael  wants my adress in here so that you can order  the  tape 
(œ3,50).

So  we  come  to another day in the life  of  Michael  Schussler's 
bedroom,  it  is time for another cup of that wonderfully  strange 
'Herb  extract tea,  previously known only to the cannibals of New 
Guinea' tea which does not quite taste like any other tea, but the 
kettle  is empty,  and there follows another shock as it violently 
convulses  in  time to the theme to the MINDBOMB  demo,  yes,  you 
interfaced  your  kettle to the soundchip,  and are paying for  it 
now!!!!

You  pour  in some fresh water,  and the ST screams,  sizzles  and 
finally goes AAARRGHH...  The numb realisation creeps in, there is 
going to be a huge repair bill for that old machine, now where did 
you put those disks with the "ULTRA TOP SECRET NEW LOST BOYS  DEMO 
- THE ONLY COPIES IN EXISTENCE - DON'T LOSE THEM"

Oh dear....

They're in...

The kettle.....

                   ...............Oh Shit...........

The Moral:- 

Make  sure no non-essential peripherals are plugged in  to  either 
your machine, or your brain, before switching on....

Love,,, Chris H...

(I  hope  somebody else is going to do something  for  the  hidden 
article, otherwise this is going to be a bit short??)
