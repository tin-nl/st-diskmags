         UBI Soft/Computers Dream      Review by Tartiana (The one and only!)

    There is not a lot I can tell you about this game as I have had it since
Christmas and can get nowhere in it. I will start this review by telling you
what it says on the back of the box.
    1) 'Be entranced by graphics, sound effects and an atmosphere out of this
world!'   Graphics: They're quite nice   Sound: I'll tell you later

(Five minute break while I listen to my favorite Pink Floyd track (Money)
Sorry!)
    2) 'Learn how to use BOB, the programable computer implanted in your arm'
         I can program it to beep (ZX Power  Yeah!!)
    3) 'Create your own character'
         Noot that it makes any difference
    4) 'Meet strange characters from 7 different species'
         I've met them and they all tried to kill me (and succeeded)
    5) 'Pilot the DRAG, a genuine flight simulator shown in 3D'
         I would, but how the hell do I find a DRAG
    6) 'Visit 1100 different places'
         I've found about 20

    This shows that the game is very hard or I'm just stupid (DON'T SAY IT! I
know what you think). All the hype about the game says it is a new kind of
adventure with several different ways of solving every problem. I personally
don't believe that.
    You are a BAT agent and your little task today is to stop the evil villian
Vrangor from blowing up the planet of Selenia, Shouldn't take longer than five
minutes, that's okay, you've got ten days. You start in the spaceport where you
must meet your contact in the toilet. Then you can go out into the city of
Terrapolis and get killed... I mean meet and talk with the strange and
wonderful inhabitants of the city.
    The most intresting part of the city is the porno theatre but I won't tell
you about that (Spaz isn't 18 yet(neither am I)). The way out of the city is
obviously through the northern airlock but the security gaurd won't let me in
so at great expense I bought a technitions security pass of someone but I still
can't get in. AAAARRRGGGHHHH!
    BOB isn't helpful either as all he tells you is when your dying and your
patheticlly low score. He is programable and canm print messages when he
detects such things as baddies, hunger and ill health but to see these messages
you have to look at him (Which I don't do very often).
    Creating your own character is a joke. The character generator gives you a
few credits to spread around various atributes. You then press a button and it
tells you what your skills are. Most of the skills are irrelevent to the game,
such as electronics, lock-picking, climbing...
    The reason the game is so expensive is that it comes with a MV16 sound
cartridge. This plays four-channel digital sound through a pair of headphones
(Not included). So far I have come across the title music, the end of game
music and some gun shot effects. Unfortunatly there is a lot of interference
and processor noise(I can pick up a radio station on mine). One good thing
about the cartridge is that it is ST-Replay compatible so you can toss BAT
across the room, load up the Empire noise-tracker, set it to replay output (Do
not set it to MV-16 output or you will lose your ears) and play some groovy
music.
    The graphics are pretty and build up on the screen a bit like windows but
you get bored with seeing the same pictures all the time. The game is very nice
but way too hard! (Yes, I know I'm brain damaged but that usually works to my
advantage. Did you know I understand Twin Peaks)
