
          THE LATEST CHAPTER FROM THE A.W.O.L CLUB
               (Absent without leave...)

 BY CIH yet again,,

The last time I wrote this column was some time ago, for MAGGIE 5, 
and it is now a long time and no sight of any of the Mega-games we 
were promised for Spring..

In the case of HUNTER,  the 3-D polygon wander-around 'em up there 
is  a  problem,  in that Activision did go under,  but this,  and a 
number  of  other games have been taken over by  French-based  The 
Disk  Company,  and  we are talking of an August release  now  for 
this  very tasty looking number,  a demo disc released earlier  in 
the  year  rated  as  one of the  most  addictive  things  I  have 
played...

MIDWINTER II has been pending as an 'Imminent' release for about 2 
months  or  so,  the  current  odds favour early  July,  my  local 
computer shop even has a dummy box with "Coming soon" embazoned on 
it, they also have a little story, as it seems that Microprose are 
a little confused on release dates,  F15 part II has just made its 
Amiga release, but was not due until September!!!!

(My sources now tell me that JULY 4th seems to be the most  likely 
date for this 'Spring Release' We will see..)
STOP PRESS:- It actually arrived about a week or so later,  review 
in MAGGIE 8 to follow...

EPIC - Don't be silly!!!  However there is initial publicity for a 
new  release  ROBOCOP  III  which  uses  the  same   filled-vector 
techniques  as  RETALIATOR  and  EPIC,  which  is  an  intriuiging 
departure  from  the  usual  bog  standard  platform-type  licence 
immortalised  by  OCEAN.  (Actually,  I  think  ROBOCOP  III  will 
probably appear first, anybody want to put money on it??)

ONES  THAT  HAVE  MADE IT,  include GODS (See the full  review  in 
MAGGIE 7),  the 3-D construction kit,  and KILLING CLOUD,  and, of 
course,  LEMMINGS.  Otherwise,  the past few months have been very 
quiet,  the  general level of releases being of the "SAM COUPE ate 
my Hamster" calibre...

So what is new, as opposed to merely being backlogged??

Quite a bit,  it seems,  firstly, the second DAMOCLES mission disc 
is due,  which features another evil doing participant KC KIMM who 
has planet-wrecking tendencies (So do I!! if you remembered to try 
my  tip from MAGGIE 3).  This adds an extra plot dimension to what 
is  an excellent but generally lonely game..  (which I will  fully 
explore  one of these days...  If I get the time...) (This now may 
be  an entirely new game MERCENARY III,  which keeps the good bits 
from DAMOCLES, but adds a whole load of character interaction.)

There  is another game due in the 3-D polygon 'Elite' manner,  EYE 
OF  THE  STORM  which  features  depth-cued  Goraud  shaded  solid 
graphics,  and  hopefully  a  good game as well for  all  the  non 
techno-porn fetishists out there...

Core  Design have their next release,  a 3-D helicopter sim FLYING 
THUNDER  due  soon,  this  owes less to the Microprose  school  of 
authenticity,  but has one mutha of a fast 3-D system instead, and 
is  more  heavily  action orientated than  a  conventional  flight 
sim... 
We  now have a preview version on disk,  courtesy of ZERO  maggie, 
and it looks quite good from where I am sitting...

A brief word for POPULOUS II - "Hi There.." (It is not due out for 
a good while yet...)

The  big licences appear to be THE SIMPSONS (from the Sky-TV  prog 
and  arcade  game,  t-shirt  etc.) and CAPTAIN  PLANET  (from  the 
ecologically  aware  and  therefore  hugely  profitable  childrens 
cartoon series..) You all know what to expect by now (Buggerall)

Millenium  are  pinning their hopes on the new  ROBIN  HOOD  game, 
which  seems to a cross between traditional isometric  adventures, 
and  POPULOUS,  which should be interesting when it is finished in 
the Autumn.  Also due to appear later in the year is ROBOCOD,  the 
follow up to JAMES POND. This game is anticipated to be about 1600 
screens in size..

I had the good fortune to run into Jez San at the Spring  Computer  
Shopper  show who told me that BIRDS OF PREY,  the ultimate flight 
sim,  by  Argonaut,  is  going to be released on to the ST (1  Meg 
machines  only  about  Sept..).  I  think I  jokingly  raised  the 
possibility of Gulf War mission disks from Microprose in the  last 
issue, this is now happening on the PC version of F15 Strike Eagle 
II,  where  up  to  eight  actual missions  have  been  recreated, 
including  bombing Saddam's presidential palace!!!  Also watch out 
for  AIR  DUEL,   from  the  same  company,  and  their  3-D  golf 
simulation...

We do not want to forget to mention the new Lost Boys game MONSTER 
BUSINESS whilst we are here (I hope it is better than  PREHISTORIC 
LANDS...) This was first seen at the 16bit Fair in July,  a review 
to follow v.shortly....

I did a piece on PSYGNOSIS,  the softco from the city of split and 
overfilled dustbin bags in the last issue, I gather that SHADOW OF 
THE  BEAST  II and AWESOME are due  soon,  ARMOURGEDDON,  LEMMINGS 
(Oops done that one already!) and the KILLING GAME SHOW have  been 
released..

For  anyone with a thing about sports sims,  there are two newies, 
JIMMY  WHITE'S WHIRLWIND SNOOKER,  in spite of the naff title,  is 
supposed to be a very good snooker game indeed,  as it was written 
by  Archer 'Dropzone and IK+' MacLean so it should be,  and GRAHAM 
GOOCH WORLD CLASS CRICKET, which is probably the first cricket sim 
ever  on an ST..  (I remember playing an ancient thing on the  C64 
about five years ago...)

I  think  that will do for the moment,  most softco's  are  fairly 
quiet  at this time,  the announcements for Christmas are sure  to 
follow later in the year...

One word of advice for anybody who wants to combine beer and  ten-
pin bowling - Don't!!!!
