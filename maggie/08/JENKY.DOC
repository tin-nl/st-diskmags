                        A SCRIPT BY DARKMAN and SCORPION


Characters: Jenkinson-Swot, wimp and a would-be top gun fighter pilot
            Blenkinsop-The dead man who is Jenkinson's co-pilot
            The Fat Aircraft Controller-The fat aircraft controller

Scene: On board an aircraft carrier, Jenkinson awaits further orders in his
       F-15 Strike Eagle.  He is trying to make conversation with Blenkinsop.

Jenkinson:  So Blenkinsop, how did you celebrate your birthday last night?  Did
            you like the present I gave you?

(Cut to close-up of a very dead Blenkinsop's face)

Blenkinsop:  (He tries to say something smarmy to 'Jenky', but he can't because
              he's dead)

'Jenky':  Ah, that good was it? I thought you might like a crate of bourbon
             ('Blenky' tries to nod his head, but he can't because he's dead)
          but I didn't get you one because I didn't think you smoked Old
          Virginia.  Am I right?

Blenky:  (He tries to say 'Are ya a woofter or what man?' but can't because
          he's dead)

Jenky:  Wha?


Blenky:  (He tries to say 'Are ya a woofter or what man?' but can't because
          he's dead)
 
Jenky:  'Scuse me?

Blenky:  (He tries to say 'Are ya a woofter or what man?' but can't because
          he's dead)

Jenky:  Pardon?


Blenky:  (He tries to say 'Are ya a woofter or what man?' but can't because
          he's dead)

Jenky:  Right that's it! I'm never going to speak to you as long as I live!
        I'm in a cream puff for ever and a day!

Blenky:  (He tries to celebrate with the crate of bourbon Jenky never bought
          him, but he can't because, not only is he dead, but Jenky didn't
          actually buy him the crate of bourbon)

(Blenky is cut-off in mid sentence by The Fat Aircraft Controller)

Fatso:  Oi! Are you still awake, because it's almost time for you to ask me
        for permission to take off

Blenky:  (He tries to say 'Fuck you asshole' but he can't because he's dead)

Janky:  Permission to take off fat bast... erm Fat Aircraft Controller

Fatso:  No

Wanky (he's changed his callsign again):  Wha? They never said that in Top Gun

Fatso:  I don't give a bloody crap 'Top Gun'.  You don't take off until I tell
        you. Got that???!!!

Wanky:  But 'Top Gun' was my favourite film

Fatso:  Well 'The Three Stooges Join the Airforce' is my fave film

Wanky:  Eh? What were we talking about?

Blenky:  (He tries to remind them that they were arguing about taking off, but
          can't because he's dead (as bloody usual! It's typical, isn't it?))

Fatso:  You can take off now

Wanky:  Eh? But, erm, you just said that I couldn't take off

Fatso:  Well shitforbrains, now I'm saying that you can take off.  Now Goddamn
        take off

Wanky:  Ok (He looks at page one of his copy of 'Flying an F-15 in Tom Cruise
        Style in 6 Easy Steps'. The page is headed 'Starting the Engine'.  
        Wanky follows the diagram and manages to start the engine)

Blenky:  (He tries to shout 'Well done fuckhole' but can't because he's dead)

Fatso:  C'mon, what the hell's taking you so long.  Can't you fly a plane or 
        summat.

Blenky:  (He tries to shake his head but can't because he's dead)

Wanky:  (He is now looking at page two.  The heading is 'Getting the plane in 
        the air'.  He tries to follow the diagram but get's a bit confused.  
        Wanky manages to reverse the plane into the control tower)

Blenky:  (He tries to scream but he can't because he's dead)

Fatso:  What the fuck was that in aid of?

Wanky:  Oxfam, sir

Fatso:  Are you trying to pick a fight Fanky?

Fanky:  My name's not Fanky, sir

Fatso:  You are trying to pick a fight, you Goddamn stinkin' sonofabitch

Wanky:  Sorry, sir.  It was in aid of bringing down the value of the Mark 
        against the pound

Fatso:  Oh, that's ok then Wanky

Wanky:  Why do you call me Wanky sir?

Fatso:  Go pull yerself off

Wanky:  I'm not sure I follow sir

Blenky:  (He tries to explain, but he can't because he's dead)

Fatso:  Look, just take off, will ya

Wanky:  Ok (This time (with a little help from Blenky) he manages to take off, 
        but in doing so, rips off his tailfin)

Wanky:  Permission to use the controls sir

Fatso:  Well, I'm not so sure... do you really think page three can help you 
here?

Wanky:  But sir, page three's just a picture of a naked aircraft

Fatso:  Try page four.......  Bet that's what's been putting him off, perverse 
        little bast

Wanky:  Ah, that's better (Jap's Salts really do work)

Fartso:  Hey! Who changed my name?  I'll be fucked by Wanky if this get's out

Wanky:  I'm flying in the air!! (Proceeds to sing 'Walking In The Air' with 
        'walking' changed to 'flying' (but Blenky seems to think (or he would
        if he wasn't so dead) that 'walking' should be 'wanking' in Wanky's 
        case))

Fartso:  Four MiGs headed in your way, Wanky.  Engage in combat, but do not 
         repeat DO NOT open fire until fired at

Wanky:  But how am I supposed to get engaged to them ALL when we're fighting 
        each other

Fartso:  What the hell are you wibbling about Wanky? Just go fight 'em

(Wanky proceeds to fly dangerously close to the MiGs)

Blenky:  (He tries to shout 'Well shoot the commie basts for God's sake' but 
          can't because he's dead)

Wanky: (into radio)  Please identify yourself

MiG Pilot One:  I am Shadovskiprzinowckskov

(Blenky get's angry that he's the only dead person around here, so he shoots 
down Shadovskiprzinowckskov)

Wanky:  Oh no!! I was supposed to get engaged to him.  Never mind, here comes 
        another one.  (into radio)  Please identify yourself

MiG Pilot Three:  I am MiG Pilot Three

(Blenky, in a state of ectstasy that he can kill somebody else, shoots down 
MiG Pilot Three)

Wanky:  Oh dear!  There goes another would be loved one

(Blenky shoots down MiG Pilot Two just because he feels a bit sadistic)

Wanky:  (into radio) Do you want to marry me?

MiG Pilot Four:  (in Russian) Eh? What do you think I am, a poof?

(MiG Pilot Four shoots down Wanky's plane.  The plane proceeds to fall at the 
speed of light which miraculously revives Blenky from his deadness)

Wanky:  Permission to bail out sir

Fartso:  No

Wanky:  Wha? You mean, you mean..

Fartso:  Yes, I'm afraid you're going to have to fight over the single 
         parachute in your two-seater aircraft, with a top speed of 640 KPH

(Wanky helps put the parachute on Blenky because he feels that he is in no 
position to argue with someone who has such a severe handicap as Blenky (ie. 
deadness)  Blenky ejects with a large grin of glee. Wanky now realises he's
been somewhat 'had', because Blenky is now alive)

Wanky:  Oh dear.  Come back here you cheating bast (Wanky jumps out in a 
desperate attempt to save his life, because he'll never survive if he sits in 
the aircraft)


Blenky and Wanky hit the sea with an almighty KERSPLOSH! and both survive. A 
Sea King helichopter takes off to rescue them.  Meanwhile, 36000 feet above, 
MiG Pilot Four surveys the chaotic happenings below, and says, in near perfect 
English...

MiG Pilot Four:  Init Marvellous!
