                    "Thalion strikes back..."

The  last hours I had the real pleasure to test a preview of  the 
new  Thalion game called "Trex Warrior".  I have been  confronted 
with  a very very fast 3 D vector  game, but first I want to tell
you something about the aim of this game:

Sometimes  in our future theirs a new and deadly sport  (american 
football and boxing is nothing against this). You're driving with 
an armed  spacecraft through an arena and it is your task to kill
the appearing droids! The faster you kill them, the higher is the 
amount of money you get. Trex Warrior is a very fast  and  smooth
3D vectorgame and I really wonder if it is  possible  to  program 
faster 3D routines as the ones Michael Bittner did for this great 
game.
When entering the arena the first time you've got a simple  laser 
blaster and within  the arena  you find things as a jumppad  (you 
need  this  pad  to destroy high flying  droids  as  the  wasp!), 
powerups (they reload your shield) but also shield-killing mines!
After  a few seconds the first droid enters the arena. Using  the
mouse you can select the speed (forward and  backward) and  steer
your craft.  After destroying several droids  (better said: after
each day of fighting!) you can buy extras as:
missiles,  shockwaves  (smartbombs!),  turbo (speed up  for  your 
craft),  weaponcooler  (when fireing to often  the  fire-frequenz 
goes  down!  The weaponcooler avoids this) and a  shieldreloader. 

The extra weapon sequenz itsself is very well done and I'm  still 
trying  to  kill these droids to be able to see this  mixture  of 
zooming and vectorgrafics while buying extras.  The final version 
of Trex Warrior should contain:
- five different worlds with a lot of different droids.
- very difficult droids after each world
- load/save a game
- several different animated sequenzes
- Soundtrack

Thalion  seems  to strike back with a new and great  vector  game 
containing  very fast grafics,  a lot of action and I hope  there 
will  be enough variation of enemies.  At the moment I  think  we 
should wait for the final version of this game 

                ... I think it'll be a HIT ...
