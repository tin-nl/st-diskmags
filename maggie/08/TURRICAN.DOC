              Rainbow Arts             Review by Tartiana

    This is the best shoot-em-up I have ever played, it is simply excellent.
The graphics are great, the sound is great, the gameplay is great and the
overall game is great. Now lets have a serious review.
    Morgul, the three headed incarnation of evil, is gone (Remember you killed
him in the original Turrican (OK, so I didn't, but he's gone anyway)) but the
forces of evil have thoughtfully provided you with someone else for you to try
your baddie-bashing skills out on. This time he is called the machine and
natrually comes with a large army of robots and mutants (Baddies to you and me)
who are intent on destroying you (Of course). Oh, and I almost forgot to tell
you that you are doing this to save the poor little picked-on inhabitants of
the planet Landorin.
    None of the above paragraph is relevent because all you have to do is blast
your way through five worlds of eleven levels of baddie swarms. After listening
to the title music (Oooooh! its good!) and reading the story of Bren McGuire
(Turrican) you press the fire button and start the game. You start with only a
simple blaster and a short lightning flash (a continuos fire weapon activated
by holding down the fire button) but there are numerous power-ups (Found by
shooting hidden blocks) to improve on your arsenal. One useful feature is that
you can turn into a metal gyroscope wheneever you like (except for underwater
and in world three) and you can lay mines aswell as being indestructable.
    Your weapons consist of a laser that has five power levels, a lightning
flash that has a vairiable length, multiple shots in two different widths, a
bouncy shot (Crap) with three levels of bouncyness. You can also pick up extra
energy refills, shields, bar lasers, extra lives and smartbombs. Bar lasers
stretch across the whole screen wiping out most baddies and you also have your
ultimate weapon. Once in every life-time you can hit the space-bar and the fire
button at the same time and set of every weapon there is. You can also pick up
crystals and you get a continue for every hundred you find.
    The first and second worlds have two levels each and are simple exploration
and blasting with an underwater scene in world 2,level 1 where you float
around. There are a few big baddies and hidden extra lives and a lift in world
2,level 2 which you have to work out how to use. These levels are basicaly the
same but in different settings and with different aliens.
    World three has three levels and has you flying a spaceship through
scrolling tunnels. The first level is just horazontily scrolling in one
direction with tunnels for you to find your way through. The ship sprite is
tiny but there is some nice paralaxing in the backround. The second level
scrolls in all eight directions and some nasty little spaces which it trys to
trap you in. In the third level your ship goes very,very fast and you have to
stop from crashing into all the bends in the tunnels.
    The fourth world is like the first two except it is yet another setting and
world 4,level 2 has a giant machine with lots of convayor belts and moving
parts. I can't tell you about world five because I only got to world 4 this
morning.
    The graphics are great with a complexly animated main sprite and lots of
fancy end of level baddies. The scrolling is fairly smooth and some levels have
interesting backgrounds.
    The sound effects are passable and the background music is quite good with
a different piece of music for every level.
    Some magazine reviews have said that this game is very difficult but it
isn't the gameplay is good and the game can get quite fast in world 3 but
otherwise you can go at your own pace and explore the many different routes
(And get killed by the time limit. Ha ha ha! you stupid fool!).
