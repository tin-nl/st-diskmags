                Review by New Mode of Delta Force



First  of all I have to say,  that this demo is one of  the  best 
demos ever created on any computer (and when I say computer,  I'm 
talking of the Amiga,  too).  TLB have tried to be original,  and 
believe me, they managed that. You don't have to bear any effects 
already done ten times like megascrollers, there's no borderstuff 
like  fullscreens,  and there are no ultraclever new  techniques. 
There's  just  one demo it can be compared  to,  and  that's  the 
"Budbrain-Demo"  on  the  Amiga.  And in my  opinion  that's  the 
biggest compliment for every democoder. 

Let me check one screen after the other,  that's the easiest  way 
for me.  But some information before:  every screen in this  demo 
has it's own titlepicture, more about that later...



LOADING SCREEN:
---------------
There's  a  pixelstorm  (see yourself) creating  a  "Loading  and 
Depacking"  sign,  a nice Mad Max music and some numbers  telling 
how  many sectors to load.  The loading and depacking  times  are 
short.

INTRO SCREEN:
-------------
A  brilliant  picture of some boys lost on  an  island,  pressing 
space  reveals  a rotating starfield,  a quartet  tune  and  some 
information being zoomed in and out. Nice.

MAINMENU:
---------
Again   a  brilliant  picture  (from  now  on  please  add   this 
information  yourself,  every screen has a brilliant  picture  in 
front of it).
This menu is completely original,  you have to control a starship 
through  a fractal landscape (something like in "Virus"  but  ten 
times better).  You have to land on different platforms to select 
the screens.
The  graphics are fast,  the music is great (a digidrums tune  by 
Max) and there are some funny effects and comments. (Try pressing 
"ESCAPE" and see yourself).
Lazy  bastards  (like  me) may enter a  password  to  select  the 
screens  with the function keys.  But I won't tell you the  word, 
you have to find it out by yourself (sadistic laugh!).
Before I forget:  There's a great backgroundpattern in the  HELP-
screen. It's something like LIFE and it's pure fun to look at.

TLB-CHAINSAW-MASSACRE:
----------------------
I  don't tell you what's going on in this screen (it would  spoil 
it). It's a little movie (like the ones in Budbrain, that's all I 
say).  The graphics,  animations and the digisound are very  well 
done. See yourself.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME:
------------------------
This  screen is something like the "CANNIBALISTIC DEF ORGY"  (one 
of  their guestscreens in a certain demo  from  Luxembourg).  But 
this time the "windows" are bigger (one screen) and are scrolled. 
There  are far more complex effects running in the windows and  I 
think  some people won't manage to code the effects going  on  in 
one window (no names here,  but their name has a 'C' in  it,  and 
it's not TCB).  This screen is pretty neat,  original and  proves 
that  the ST is a multitasking machine,  too.  <-- That  sentence 
was crap, really!

THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT:
---------------------------------
The best chessboard routine I've ever seen (and I did see  many). 
There are hills and valleys in which the colors get  darker.There 
are  balls jumping from the distance,  the usual starfield and  a 
completely unreadable ballscroller made out of little balls  (<-- 
a  ballscroller  always  is made  out  of  balls,  bummer!).  The 
letters are rotating like crazy,  you can't read it.  I just made 
out  that Tanis has written the scrolltext.  After that  my  eyes 
were bleedin'. Very nice screen, anyway.

WHAT A BUMMER! (THE RESPECTABLES):
----------------------------------
The  only  guestscreen in this demo is made by a  certain  German 
crew  with  at least twenty different  names.  It's  their  third 
screen and let me say the least: It's their best screen yet.
Zooming text,  a  five-layer-scrolling-ballfield,  quartet-music, 
very nice logos,  funny texts and sarcastic greetings (Hey Tyrem: 
we have a female member,  read our interview in this issue), many 
different fx like exploding credits signs,  moving starfields and 
nice  back-ground  scrolling  at the end prove that  they  are  a 
promising demo crew.  Too bad that Duke has to attend the  German 
army (NL-390, he he he). Great screen.

YOUR MIND IS MY ASHTRAY:
------------------------
This  is  Digital Insanity's contribution,  a real bastard  of  a 
snurkelscroller  (the rotating thingies).  It's VERY big and  has 
some  nice waveforms.  There are at least one million  (or  less) 
little scrollers swinging up and down,  a big flying TLB-logo and 
lotsa rasters.  There's a new Mad Max tune playing. Brill screen, 
Stefan!

KOMISCHE SACKRATTEN VON DER HOEHLE:
-----------------------------------
Before I take a look at the screen,  I will try to translate  the 
name for all you non-GERMAN readers:  It's something like:  FUNNY 
FLEAS  ON  YOUR BALLS COMING FROM  A  CAVERN.  TA!TA!TAAA!  First 
price for the funniest name ever.
This  screen is something like the KAOS-screen in  Budbrain,  but 
much more improved with more effects.  For all readers who  never 
had the opportunity to see Budbrain (shame on you!),  this screen 
is  something like an ACID-video (forgive me,  Tim!).  There's  a 
fucking  brilliant  ACID-tune (quartet) and all  FX  are  running 
completely in sync with this tune.  The FX are all very nice.  In 
my  opinion  it's  the best screen in  this  demo.  If  you  love 
psychoFX and technomusic, this screen's for you!

THERE ARE NO SHEEP IN OUTER MONGOLIA:
-------------------------------------
A very clever textzoomer,  a starfield with moving  viewpoint,  a 
nice  rotating chessboard,  something like a  parallax  ballfield 
and a new Jochen-music make this screen a pleisure to look at.

MODULE INFORMATION:
-------------------
Not a screen,  just some text telling you about forthcoming  data 
disks  for  this demo.  This means you will be able to  load  the 
disks from this screen.

RESETDEMO:
----------
Some "vertical" rasters,  a quartet tune and all the credits  for 
this demo can be found in this little screen.


General overview:
-----------------

This demo has by far the best presentation ever.  Each screen has 
it's  own introduction picture (and they are all extremely  good, 
some  of  the best stuff ever seen on  the  ST),  there's  always 
colorfading  (very nice faderoutine) and even the music is  faded 
down.  The  mainmenu  is kept in memory and doesn't  need  to  be 
reloaded every time you leave a screen.
This demo is the most original demo ever released on the ST,  the 
graphics,  the coding and the music is brilliant.  So please,  if 
you  don't  like  this demo,  go and  shoot  yourself  (no,  hang 
yourself that won't make such a disgusting mess).
