         (Criticism and ideas for better demos)

         An article by New Mode of Delta Force


I hate :
--------

- Demos that refuse to work on four meg ST's (because when you
  clear the whole memory (till $400000) on a four meg ST you'll
  get a buserror)
- Resetdemos you can't exit with the second reset
- Demos with greetings and memberlists in every single screen
  (except in guest-screens)
- Demos without a menu. If you want to see the last screen,
  you'll have to load through all other screens before.
- Demos that put back the selector on the first line and not
  on the last selected screen
- Too slow scrollers
- Using ripped graphics with the wrong palette (many used the
  Knighthawks-font with the colors in the wrong direction which
  made the antialiasing look very crappy)
- Demos running in more than one vbl (except 3D-stuff)
- Trash in the lower border because the screen height is too low
- Having to reload the mainmenu every time on more than halfmeg ST's
- Using slow depackers
- Flickering rasters
- Boring fullscreens just to have a fullscreen
- Intros where you can't abort, and have to wait for a long time
- Always the same screens (no more "bigscrollers" and techtron-demos
  please!!!). Originality is the most important thing nowadays!
- Demos that don't switch down from 60HZ to 50HZ because the coders
  think 50HZ is default. But some guys have a 60HZ-switch in their
  patched roms.
- Switching unsychronised to 50HZ. That will cause syncerrors on some
  ST's. Just do a vsync before...
- Demos where you have to enter disk-info on your own when you copy it.
  (Just write the info in the bootsectors please)

Ideas and tips:
---------------

- If you have a minigame as a mainmenu, please do an optional little
  menu (if you press 'HELP') where you can select all screens very fast
- Use ICE-Packer, it's by far the best packer in every domain
- Optional reset with CONTROL-ALTERNATE-DELETE in every screen (for all
  the poor MEGA-ST users)
- If you have an internal copy program, make it work on monochrome
  monitors (it will appear if you boot in monochrome-mode). Many guys
  copy their demos in shops where they don't have a color-monitor, and
  so they aren't able to copy a demo without a monochrome-copy
- If you have a joystick-controlled mainmenu, do a keyboard-control too
