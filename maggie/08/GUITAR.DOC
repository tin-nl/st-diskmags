  Now that I have been an avid guitarist for about eight years I 
have decided to write a brief revision of the guitar in general 
and some useful ideas to aid beginners. I'll begin with the 
instrument:

1. Description- The guitar looks like a large ukulele and has six 
                steel strings. The four lowest ones are wound 
                with wire and unravel with wear. The highest 
                string often breaks when the the guitar is first 
                tuned but this doesn't matter as there are still 
                five left and you only have five fingers anyway.
                 The guitar was obviously invented by someone 
                with six fingers so anyone with five fingers 
                attempting to play the instrunent has a handicap       
                from the outset.
                 When playing a chord, which is a group of notes 
                that are supposed to sound good together, one 
                finger presses two or more strings. This is 
                called a "barre". Playing a barre leaves a deep 
                groove in your finger, pretty soon you can't 
                stand the pain, give up, and go down to the
                neighborhood barre to have a beere.     
               
2. Selection- When buying a guitar, examine it carefully. Make 
              sure it has a strong neck, as this part could split 
              if the guitar hit something solid like a tree.  
              
               Check the frets (little metal strips on the neck), 
              frets are important. When you push a string down on 
              a fret the guitar makes a buzzing sound. Choose a 
              guitar that has a pleasant buzzing sound as you 
              will have to listen to quite a lot of it.             
                                                      

3. Tuning up- Always tune the guitar before playing. Do this very 
              slowly with your ear close to the strings. Pick the 
              strings while twisting the tuning keys this way and 
              that, then, assume a thoughtful expression to make 
              it look like you know what you're doing. Don't ever 
              over-tighten the strings or else one may snap and 
              tear off your ear.
               Some succsessful amateur guitarists spend an 
              entire evening just tuning up and people go away 
              saying "What a wonderful sense of pitch!" or "He 
              has a fine ear!" (If he has never broke a string 
              they say "He has fine ears!")


4. Playing- Three chords are all you need to know to play most 
            songs on the guitar. They are "E","A" and another one 
            called a "seventh chord" which is too difficult to 
            bother with, so when you come to that part of the 
            song, just buzz the strings lightly and assume a 
            thoughtful expression. This is known as "Faking it", 
            the first term every amateur musician learns.

             "E" and "A" are easy to learn, practice shifting 
            back and forth between the two until your fingers 
            bleed. While making chords with your left hand, it is 
            neccesary to strike the guitar with your right hand. 
            Most people prefer to use a pick, but you can brush 
            your knuckles repeatedly across the strings for a 
            folk-guitar effect. This soon gets blood all over the 
            guitar (but as I said most people prefer to use a 
            pick). 

             Playing with only two chords limits your repertoire, 
            but there are a few songs like "Clementine" and "Tom 
            Dooley" that can be played with two chords.
             Unfortunately they aren't "E" and "A".
