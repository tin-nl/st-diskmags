                         -> Introduction <-

23rd  to 25th August,  D《seldorf,  Germany.  About  40000  user, 
freaks,  programer  and  other guys fight through the  two  halls 
filled with Atari equipment and products.  Again it is my job  to 
tell you about these products,  but you'll also get some informa-
tion  about special Atari-crap-talk (new ST and  TT  machines???) 
and news from the demo-scenery.
Let's  start  a  further journey into the deep  dungeons  of  the 
Atari Show'91 and enjoy it......

                -> Products, projects and programs <-

Hall 12,  Atari stand:  when I saw this stand I was suprised  and 
shocked  at  the same time because there has been a lot  of  room 
filled with a few tables, TTs, STEs and Notebooks. My opinion: to 
much room and less machines.  Some people also think that it is a 
sign for the financial situation of Atari!  Or is it just a  CAD-
mistake in conection with the escape routes?  Atari says  nothing 
according to it's own stand (why?)!
They  presented  the Notebook with a better cursorpad  but  again 
they  wasn't  able to tell us when they are going  to  sell  this 
machine for about 4000 marks.
TT  and  Unix, another "never ending story" and we heard about  a 
nearly finished version.  Several developers got this version but 
Atari doesn't know when they'll sell it.

                       -> MAXON: Harlekin II <-

Maxon  presented a new version of the utillity collection  called 
"Harlekin II".  The collection contains a GEM editor,  data-bank, 
disk-, file- and memory-monitor, calculator, terminalprogram, new 
control-field, mouse-speeder, makro-generator and a lot more. The 
program uses dynamic-memory-management and just loads the modules 
you use.  Harlekin II is working on all TOS machines and  grafik-
adapters for only 159 marks!

MultiGEM  (the Multitasking-System) now also runs on the  TT  and 
you  can  work with six programs at the same  time  deviding  the 
processor capacity e.g.  background-printing. Price: 159 marks.

Last  but  not least we  found  "Outside",  the  virtuell-memory-
extension for the TT. You can use you're harddisk memory (maximum 
128 MByte) as RAM memory. Price: 99 marks.

"Overscan TT" runs in all colourmodes of the TT and also supports 
programs as "Signum" and "Stad" which normally do not work on big 
screens.  Supporting the TT-Low-resolution mode (256 colours) you 
can  produce professional video animations.  The TT Mid- and  the 
ST-high mode uses 832 x 496 pixels. You just have to put the card 
onto the VME bus. The price for hard- and software: 299 marks.

                     -------------------
               --- News from the Demoscenery ---
                     -------------------

During this fifth Atari show in D《seldorf we also found some  of 
these very famous guys called "Demo-hackers".  The Lost Boys came 
to  present their final demo for the Atari ST with the name  "Ooh 
crikey wot a scorcher". This is their last demo and I wanna thank 
the  Lost Boys for all their fantastic stuff on the  ST  (special 
greetings to Manikin, Sammy Joe and Oxygen).
Most  of  the  freaks  meet  at  the  stand  of  the  Funny  Bits 
Computerclub.  This stand has been very crowded all the time  and 
you  had  the chance to meet some of these mad hackers  from  all 
over  the  world .....  again greetings to  all  of  them,  still 
hacking on the ST and keeping it "alive"!

                   -> Wings of Death II <-

Also  on  the  Funny  Bits  stand  Marc  Rosocha presents his new
Eclipse product "Wings of death II". More fantastic grafics, more
action and a great two player mode may create a new MEGAHIT!
Eclipse  seems to be on it's way up to one of the most  important 
software  companies for the Atari ST and in contrast  to  several 
other  companies Eclipse wants to support the ST during the  next 
years.  Most of the Eclipse products are programmed on the ST and 
converted to the other systems (Ami.. or PC).

                        -------------
                   --- Atari-crap-talk --- 
                        -------------

Nothing  new  about  the new Atari  game  called  "Jaguar".  This 
machine should be a 64 bit game beating all actual systems on the 
market. Release date about summer 1992!
During  1992 Atari might present several new machines  basing  on 
the  STE  and  TT.  One of these machines should be  a  68040  TT 
containing  a transputer slot for more power.  Only a  rumour  or 
reallity, Atari knows it. 
The  so called "Falcon" seems to be a real machine.  The user  is 
able to get a 68020, 68030 and also a 68040 version. Release date 
for this computer is also the summer 1992! During the next time a 
TOS-update  for  2.x  is coming for all  users.  Atari  is  still 
thinking about a price arround 180 or 190 marks.
During  the last half year Atari must have had a lot of  problems 
concerning  the personal appointment but also concerning the  co-
operation between the german Atari team and the Atari company  in 
america.

                       After all ....

I hope you got some interesting information about the fifth Atari 
show in D《seldorf.  Atari has to solve the personal problems and 
must get a clear line within their products and they must be able 
to inform the user about this!

Best wishes for you and Atari,
                    
                   hope to see you on the Atari show 1992 

                                                    in D《seldorf
