Howdy Folks and welcome to Mutant Monthly Part 5 - The Revenge of 
the revenge etc. (you didn't think I was going to type all that 
again did you?). Incase you are wondering why I am doing a Mutant 
Monthly 5 when there is no number 4 then I will explain. 
Basically I was getting really pissed of with typing articles for 
Disk Maggie so The Tick (kind chappy that he is) decided to do a 
Mutant Monthly part 4. I don't know whether he has finshed yet or 
what so I thought I'd call this part 5 to be on the safe side. 
Anyway, part 4 will probably either be in the same Maggie as this 
article or in a Maggie afterwards. Infact part 4 might have been 
in Maggie 6 as I ain't got that yet. Is this getting a bit 
confusing/boring/crap/etc ? I don't think you need to answer that 
question. 

Okay, the time at the moment is 1:18 am on Tuesday 30th July 
1991. I wasn't going to start to type this yet as I was trying to 
get my Reviews done for Maggie 7, but now they won't be needed 
until maggie 8 which is at least 2 months away. It is very hot in 
my bedroom and I don't think I will be able to sleep. However I 
think it's worth a try so I'm going to bugger off now (already!) 
and try to get enough sleep to be able to get up before mid day 
tomorrow (today)..........

Friday 16th August, 23:33: Well, it's been quite a while since I 
last typed ain't it? I sent off my reviews to Chris and he said 
that the next maggie was going to be released by the end of 
August, so I thought I'd better get typing this thing as if this 
does not get in the next maggie it will not be relevent by the 
time it is put in (I think I'll just go back and read that 
sentence as I'm not sure it made complete sense) (well it didn't 
make much sense but who cares anyway?). I've just been out 
celebrating with my sister because she has just passed her A 
levels, so I am not really in a fit state to be typing this, but 
I'll give it a go. Right then, after 1 whole page of waffling I 
think I can start this artilce properly now........ And the first 
subject is.....................

T2

Yes indeedy! Today was the first day this film was being shown in 
England so I thought I'd nip down the cinema with Raphael and 
have a butchers. We arrived at the place 40 minutes early (!!) 
and the queue wasn't too long then. Infact by the time we were 
let in (five minutes early!!!!!) the queue was still suprisingly 
quite short. I think alot of people had thought that it would be 
very crowded on the first day and so did not turn up, but because 
so many people didn't turn up there was hardly any one there 
(makes sense really). So, we waited for 40 minutes in the intense 
heat for nothing.
  I was in two minds about a sequel to the film Terminator. As 
you will know if you've seen this film (who hasn't?) it is bloody 
excellent and by the end of the film you are thinking "I'd like 
to see some more of that, hope they make a sequel". However as I 
queued up outside the cinema I was having second thoughts. A 
sequel is never as good as the original film, even when the first 
film was crap, and seeing as The Terminator was one of the best 
films ever made I knew these guys really had there work cut out 
to make something that was even remotely as good as the first. 
  If you haven't seen T2 (which you probably will have by the 
time you read this) you will still know that is cost 100 million 
to make, and that the special FX are some of the best you are 
likely to see in any film this decade. What I was afriad off was 
that they would spend so much of FX that some how they would 
forget about a story line.
  You should also know that in the sequel, Arnie is the good guy, 
unlike in the original. Knowing this before you see the film does 
rather spoil the first 10-20 mins of the film. You see when the 
two guys materialise, because arnie was the baddy in the first, 
and is also much bigger and stronger than the other dude, you 
think that he is still the bad guy and that the other bloke is 
another normal human who will try and save Sarah and John from 
the clutches of the nasty Terminator. I don't really want to tell 
you anything about the film as it will only spoil it. Well, maybe 
I'll tell you a few bits. What happens is when the real baddy 
appears (played by Robert Patrick) he kills a Police officers and 
uses his clothes. His target is to kill John Connor and so he 
goes down the arcades looking for him. John sees this bloke 
looking for him and thinks that the police are after him for 
something, so he runs. The Nasty terminator runs after him and 
there is a chase down the corridor. Then John runs out through a 
door to see Arnie coming towards him with a box of flowers, which 
are disguising a large (erm..) gun. John's Under wear turns brown 
as he realises that in about 3 seconds he will be full of big 
wholes and that his body will be made up of 50% lead. Anyway he's 
stuck between the two and just as you think (or are supposed to 
think) Arnie will kill him, he tells him to duck and shoots the 
other terminator to bits. 
   When I read a review of this film it said that it was mainly 
one big running battle between the two terminators. This is not 
strictly true though and there is a bit in the middle of the film 
where the T-1000 doesn't appear for about 30 minutes. 
   I had heard so much about the FX of the T-1000 in this film 
that I was expecting something really special. And thats exactly 
what I got. For example there is one part where Arnie holds a gun 
about 2 cms away from the T-1000's head and fires. You see his 
head split right in two, but then mould back together again so 
there is no trace of where the bullet went. I did feel however 
that the ability of the Terminator to split up and build back 
together again was mainly just to show off the FX and really 
didn't have much to do with the story line. Some of the best FX 
in the film were not actullay to do with the robot. These FX were 
done when Sarah is having a dream about the future. You see 
people playing with there kids in a playground and then there is 
a massive explosion in the backround (nuclear bomb). Even though 
the bomb is miles away you see the flames engulf everyone, you 
see Sarah completely on fire as everything around her burns 
aswell. You then see lots of different shots of the city being 
blown away. Although this was probably easier to do than the 
robot, FX wise, I found it very effective indeed.
   Right, time to tell you another bit out of the film I think. 
Okay, Arnie and John are going to rescue Sarah from the looney 
bin and John is trying to explain to Arn that he should not kill 
people. Before they enter the prison John makes arnie swear not to 
kill anyone. So, they pull up out side the front gate and a 
security guard comes out and asks for some ID. Arnie, Calmly gets 
off the bike and shoot the bloke in both knee caps. John shouts 
something like "what did you do that for!", and arnie says "he'll 
live". Okay, so it isn't funny in the telling, but it did raise a 
chuckle or two in the cinema. 
   Time to compare the first and second film now. Firstly the FX 
are miles better in T2 than is T1, which is what you'd expect 
seeing as they used so much money on them. Also there is another 
ingrediant in T2, humour. About the only mildly amusing bit in 
the fist film was when Arnie said "I'll be back" and then drove 
through the front of the police station in his car. While I did 
have a giggle at most of the amusing bits in T2, I somehow 
thought that it didn't fit in with the rest of the film. Also, 
becuase everyone thought Arnie saying "I'll be back" in T1 was so 
good, they had him saying it again in this one, which didn't work 
at all.
   The Stroyline is pretty darn good I have to say, and the 
action keeps the film exciting to the end (and after). It tells 
you all the things you wanted to know after watching the first 
one, like how the wars started etc. There is still a vital 
ingrediant which the first had and the second didn't though. It 
is hard for me to explain what it is, you can only really find 
out by watching both films yourself. I think one of the best bits 
about T1 was the idea of there being something out there, it's 
only aim being to kill you, it would track you down for as long 
as it takes, you couldn't bargin with it, pay it not to kill you, 
reson with it, it was just there to find and kill you. There was 
just two humans against this thing, where ever they went the 
terminator would find them. This feeling seems to have been lost 
in T2 as there is now a Terminator on the good guys side aswell. 
Even with the odds stacked against them it just wasn't the same.
   I think I will do ratings for the original film aswell so you 
get a good comparison

RATINGS
FILM: The Terminator
GRAFICAL FX: 80% (not bad considering how old it is)
SOUNDTRACK: 92%
STORYLINE: 90% (Not as simple as it first seems)
APPEAL: 96% 
OVERALL: 96% (what can I say?)

FILM: Terminator 2: Judgemnet Day (you find out why it is called 
that in the film)
GRAFICAL FX: 96%
SOUND TRACK: 92% (similar to the first)
STORYLINE: 94% (More complex and well thought out than the first)
APPEAL (after seeing it once): 93%
OVERALL: 94%

Although I knew they could never re make a classic like 
Terminator, it was still a very excellent film and I would 
recomend you watch it as soon as you have the chance. If, for 
some reason you haven't seen T1 then watch that first!!!
   Oh yeah, I wouldn't pin too much hope on there being a third 
Terminator, I can't see how they'd ever make a viable storyline 
for it. If you wanna know why then watch T2!

The time is now 00:47 and I have to be up at 7:30 tomorrow so I 
think I'll get some kip now................

***************************************************************

INTERLUDE 1: If you need the loo go now!!
Adverts in this break are for "Have you forgotten how good they 
taste", "Everything we do is driven by you", "Don't you just love 
it" and "It's not red and there's no rocks in it" (ooer).

***************************************************************

Sat 17/8/91, 10:11: That was a long interlude, about 9 hours I 
think. Hopefully everyone has had time to go to the bog and get 
something to eat by now. T1 is on tele tonight so I may change my 
ratings a bit after watching it again (I've got it on video but I 
thought I'd watch it on tele anyway). Anyway, on with the 
article......

NEIGHBOURS

Before I start I'd just like to say I DO NOT WATCH THIS PROGRAMME 
(very often). Have you noticed that the computer in Pauls office 
is an Ameega? Anyway, in one episode (the only one I've watched 
this year, honest!) the computer (and I use that word in it's 
broadest possible term) got a virus (HahAhaHaHahA!!!). A kid 
computer genius (bit like me!) offered to eradicate the nasty 
from the computer, but Paul didn't want him to. He reckoned that he 
would not be used to using such an advanced piece of office 
equipment. WHAT?!?! What does he think the kid owns, a ZX 81? I've 
found more advanced pieces of equipment in an ancient history 
museum! And anyway, I'd hardly call a half meg Ameega connected 
to nothing more than a Monitor (ie. no hard drive etc.) something 
to do with serious work, even I have a more advanced set up than 
that (which isn't hard really seeing as I own an ST). So I would 
just like to nominate Neighbours for being the most completely 
lame TV prog this side of the milky way. 

BODYTALK

No I not talking about that crap Kids TV prog that was on a 
couple of years ago and consisted of a complete spastic wearing 
pyjamas doing stupid mimes to a bunch of children (not that I'd 
know anything about it of course, it was Mike who told me all 
about it). No no no, not that at all, I'm talking about a Aussie 
proggy that was on a couple of weeks ago, it was all about 
people, dead people to be more specific. They had loads of 
interviews with people who had a job which was something to do 
with dead people. Also at various points in the prog they had a 
bit telling you what happens to a dead body as it decays. For 
example, did you know that after a few days the skin on the hands 
and head shrink so it looks like the hair and the finger nail 
have continued to grow after death, when infact they haven't. 
They told you how the face goes green and the tongue swells up so 
it sticks out of the persons mouth. After about 1 week you can 
easily scratch the person skin away coz it has started to decay. 
Apparently, and this is the bit I found most amazing, after about 
three weeks, there is so much gas inside the body, it with have 
expanded up to three times the size it was when the person died. 
Bloody strange eh? In the interviews one bloke was saying about 
the first time he had to go and pick up a dead guy. He was a drug 
addict and had been dead for a few weeks. By then he was covered 
from head to toe in maggots, and all other sorts of creepy 
crawlies. Anyway the other guy got the blokes feet and he had to 
pick up the head. As he did this the head fell off and all the 
maggots went all over him!!!!!! Another bloke was saying about 
how they discovered a dead body which was about 8-9 weeks old. By 
this time a body is mainly slush, and so they had to get a broom 
and sweep what was left of the body into some plastic bags (so 
they could be examined later). 
   Another thing that was talked about was suicide. One guy had 
got a gun under his chin and blown his own brains out. When the 
police came they had to get buckets and scrap parts of the guys 
brain off the walls with their hands!!! There were bits off the 
bloke everywhere, especially on the ceiling. It all had to be 
scraped of and sent to forensic, don't know why really, I mean it's 
pretty obvious how he died ain't it? When they went into the room 
and found a guy lying on the floor with no head, carrying a shot 
gun, with bits of skull, brain etc. everwhere, they're not going to 
think he did it with poison are they?
   This prog was on channel 4, watch out for the repeat!

****************************************************************

INTERLUDE 2: Well seeing as Don hasn't finished this text yet I ( 
The Tick ) am gonna write some drivel. anyway what is Don on 
about with his terminator 2 review ? beats me, all I can say that 
in my opinion Terminator 2 beats shit out of the first effort. 
anyway that's enough about terminator 2 and I'll say a bit about 
what happened today, well Don had stayed the night at my house 
and we were planning to compile a really shit demo coz we had 
loads of piccies that I had done and loads of Modules by Mikey 
that were just sitting on disks so we were gonna stick them 
together. Well everything went wrong and we gave up. The first 
thing that happened is that Devpac wouldn't compile the source 
code we had done properly and then the disk we were using 
corrupted up. Then I spent about 2 hours drawing a font and when 
I saved it the font had corrupted so I couldn't compile it with 
the other source code we had done coz Devpac didn't like it and I 
didn't know it hadn't saved properly.

       Anyway that demo was a peice of shit and we have allready 
almost finished our mondo music demo which isn't bad for a first 
demo. I did all Gfx, Mikey did all Music ( yes we are using 
ORRIGINAL mods, not just lame ameoba converts ) and Magz did all 
the coding but he is on holiday at the moment so will finish it 
when he gets back. The thing about Split Infinity is that we have 
10 members ( I think but not a lot of them do anything ) Don is 
meant to be learning 68K but by the time he learns to do summut 
decent they will have computers where you will just have to think 
directly the game designs and the computer will re-create them 
into a game.

       It now looks as if Mutant monthly 4 and 5 will be in the 
same issue of Maggie, well maybe, coz my article features to much 
swearing so it maybe scrapped or edited.

       I'd just like to put a little message out to other crews " 
Stop using ameoba modules on demos " this is coz there are decent 
ST musicians and it really pisses me off to hear the local Ameoba 
owner say " well the Ameoba must be better than the ST coz loads 
of ST demos use amiga music ". 
 
Any way I must end this interlude so Don can get back on the 
Keyboard and type his drivel.

Drivel? How dare you!!!! I'll have you know that my articles (Don 
here!) are some of the most informative and interesting you're 
likely to find this side of Jupiter (well perhaps not quite that 
good). I think this interlude is getting a bit long now, time to 
snip!

****************************************************************

The next subject is....

T2 (do you some how feel you've read this before?)

Okay, there seems to be a bit of controversy here about which 
film is best. Both Raph and the Tick seem to prefer the second 
Terminator. Raph thinks that the second was a bit better, and you 
already know what ticky thinks of it, sorry, the tick said he 
prefered to be called Rob Chiropodist (can't think why). Anyway I 
still think the original film was the better of the two. Also the 
Daily Express thought that the first film was better overall (but 
who gives a toss what they think?). I reckon a lot of people will 
like the sequel better because of it's far, far (far!) superior 
FX. I wouldn't even think of arguing that the second wasn't a 
classic, but for me there's still no beating the original....

Kick Off 3 (?)

It seems that plans are a hand, sorry, a foot to make a Kick Off 
3. What I want to know is how are they going to improve on KO2's 
gameplay. As you will know if you have played KO2, the gameplay 
unbelievably unbelievable. I just hope any improvements they make 
won't turn the gameplay into the stuff you got when loading up 
Final Whistle. If a KO3 is released then watch Maggie for a 
review.......

LYNX 2 (the revenge!!)

Is it out over here? I read in a mag that some blokes cousin got 
the new lynx at Argos. I've had a flick through the Argos 
catalogue and it is no where to be seen, they never even sold the 
old lynx!! Also the Lynx 2 supposedly got the hardware to make 
use of a tele adaptor which the first didn't. Anyway, as soon as 
I see the Lynx 2 in a shop I am going to buy it, so watch this 
space (again!) for a review!!

ARACADES (goodbye hard earned cash, hello exciting gameplay, 
stunning grafixxxx, and state of the art sound (hopefully))

Well, I've been down to a fair (twice!) that's been on in our 
area for a few days, and apart from a few boring rides there are, 
ARCADES!!!!!! So here's a quick review of all the old/new 
good/crap arcades I played there.

FINAL FIGHT: This will probably be out on the ST by the time you 
read this, if the ST version is anything like the arcade then it 
should sell like hot cakes. The arcade is a getting on a bit now 
but it's still one of the best beat the shit out of 'em ups 
around (in my opinion).
RATING: 85%

RAD MOBILE: Don't know how old this is but it looks pretty nice. 
The one I played was in an upright box, although I have played it 
in the sit down type version aswell. I'm usually pretty good at 
Racing games but it took me quite a while to get used to this 
one, its not bad though.
RATING: 82%

STREET FIGHTER 2:I didn't actually play this coz I don't like it 
that much. Having said that its Kilometres better than the first.
RATING: 73%

TIME TRAVELLERS (I think that's what it's called):This is the new 
SEGA game which uses holograms instead of your usually run of the 
mill grafixxxx. There is no glass in front of the screen on this 
game and you can poke your hand inside and try and grab the little 
figures in the game. The visuals are very effective indeed, but 
unfortunately the gameplay lacks a bit. It's worth trying just 
to check out the GFX though.
RATING: 82%

GALAXY FORCE 2: Quite nice gfx, bit strange in the control 
department.
RATING: 78%

Right that's it, I haven't got time to list ALL the arcades I 
played, and besides I can't remember half of them anyway. Time 
for another subject.....

Oh damn, we seem to have run out of subjects! I think this means 
that MUTANT MONTHLY part 5 has finally come to an end.

Don, 27/8/90 (if Chris Holland is right about maggie coming out 
by the end of August I don't think this article will get there 
in time. Bugger..)

You DO NOT have to send international reply coupons when writing 
(for more info on this see Mutant Monthly 4 by Chiropodist Tick).

bye bye!!

P.S. I have now got my grubby mits on my very own Lynx 2!!! I 
bought it from Littlewoods Index Catalogue for œ84.99. No time 
for a review this issue, but there should be one next maggie. 
Also I will try to do regular reviews for lynx games (first game 
will be Slime World), see ya then!! 

Final Final finish date: 1st Sept (maggie was supposed to be 
finished by the end of august!!!!)
