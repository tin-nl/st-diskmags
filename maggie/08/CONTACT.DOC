
HI THERE,                                          
        MY NAME IS ALAN JOHNSTONE. HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE READ SOME OF MY 
ARTICLES IN THIS MAGGIE. I AM LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO WRITE TO AND SWAP 
PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE WITH. I WOULD PREFER TO WRITE TO GIRLS FROM ENGLAND 
(BECAUSE OF MAILING COSTS AND THE RARITY OF FEMALE CONTACTS), BUT I AM 
WILLING TO WRITE TO ANYONE FROM ANYWHERE.     
                                                                       
PLEASE WRITE TO :-
