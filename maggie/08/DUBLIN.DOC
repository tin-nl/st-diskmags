
                  DUBLIN - CITY OF CULTURE 1991

     It was with a mixture of shock and delight that I received 
the news that I was to represent wales in the British Isles 
debating championship. This meant a free trip to Dublin and a 
three day stay there, but it also meant lots of work and the 
nerve shattering event of giving a speech in front of hundreds 
of people plus a panel of audjudicators.
     My easter holidays were cut short as I had to spend the last 
week researching the Palestine question, for the motion for the 
debate was 'This house would give Palestine back to the 
Palestinians'. We were to propose this motion.
     A few late night meetings in the Labour office in newtown 
with my fellow debators, Nia Hughes and David Tomkins and our 
tutor Mr Neil Butler, prepared us for the debate.
     On wednesday when all normal people were returning to 
school, we were lugging great suitcases through the sixth form 
block getting strange stares from all and sundry. Ten O'Clock 
came and it was time for us to depart. We clambered aboard the 
minibus and were subjected to Mr B's eratic driving. 
     We stopped briefly in Newtown where I bought some reading 
matter for the journey, The Guardian, New Computer Express, Atari 
ST User and ST Action. I baffled the lady in Smiths with tales of 
Dublin and she only charged my 29p for ST action! (It wasn't even 
worth that!)
     I flicked through my mags on the way up Wales, but this only 
made me feel sick. We picked up two hitchikers in north wales, 
and by an amazing co-incidence Nia knew one of them. They chatted 
about clarinets!
     When we finally arrived at Holyhead, Mr B naturally drove to 
the wrong parking area (Heavy good vehicles entrance - we were 
foot passengers!). When we got a space in the right car park, we 
had to endure a marathon walk back to the seaport carrying 
enormously heavy luggage. Exhausted, we got to the entrance and 
collapsed.
     "Oh shit, I haven't locked the minibus. Whose going to do it 
for me?" Asked Mr. B.
     I was volunteered for this arduous task.
     I trudged back over road and bridges muttering obscenities 
under my breath. The only thing that cheered me up was a blond 
girl a few years older than me who'd just crossed the road as was 
walking in front. What a smart ass she had. I quickened my pace 
so I could catch up with her. She surprised me by turning round 
and chatting to me! She'd just been to Dublin and said it was a 
wonderful city. She wished me luck in the debate and hoped she'd 
see me again!
     I said my farewells and locked the minibus. By the time I 
got back to the seaport, the ferry was about to leave and the 
rest of the team were worried I was going to miss it because I'd 
been gone so long.
     This was my first time on a ferry, and what a weird 
contraption it is! The first thing I did was get some grub, 
vegetable lasagne and chips. After this was polished off I 
started reading all my magazines again. This took approximately 
two minutes!
     The crossing was quite rough. David Tomkins had spent the 
last week in the norfolk broads boating, and this was his main 
hobby. Yet on this crossing, he didn't feel too good!
     For the last half an hour I went out on deck and watched the 
land coming closer. We had been in darkness until we reached the 
coast of Ireland, and Dublin looked very special. It moved me in 
a way I can't explain. It really felt like my hometown, though 
I'd never visited it before.
     As we left the ferry, I had the misfortune of having two old 
men behind me, coughing phlegm onto my black jacket.
     "Rough crossing eh?" Growled one.
     "Hell of an asshole kicker!" Replied the other.
     We dismounted the boat to the sound of a band playing. A 
welcoming commitee for us?
     The first real Irishman we spoke to was a friendly taxi 
driver who took us too the Montrose Hotel. This looked awful from 
the outside, and was ideally situated. Right next to the dual 
carriageway!
     We paid the extortionate taxi fair, and went to the 
reception. The girl behind the desk was exceptionally nice, and 
all through the stay we made excuses to make inquiries just so we 
could see her!
     Our rooms weren't too bad, we had a bathroom in our room 
and a TV that could pick up all English channels, two Irish 
ones, a few radio stations (!) and sky news.
     We'd missed the dinner they laid on, so we made our way to 
Trinity college for the first debate. Fortunately we were just 
watching this one, not participating in it. It was hard enough 
just finding the debating chamber.
     Once we got in I saw a notice saying that Terry Pratchett 
was giving a talk in another part of the building tonight at 
7.30. I was desperate to go to this instead of watching a debate 
on the cold war! But unfortunately, permission for this 
rebellious act wasn't granted.
     The debate definitely was worth watching. Their debating 
society was quaint. They had a librarian who had no books, and 
interesting procedures that they had to follow. They started off 
by voting members to the committee. There was one drunk mature 
student who desperately wanted to get on the committee but no one 
would vote for him. He started swearing and eventually threatened 
to smash the chairmans face in as he wouldn't second his 
nomination.  
     We left half way through the debate - our stomachs dictated 
this. As we left the chamber we met a very nice student who 
invited upstairs for drinks. If it had been up to me, we would 
have gone with her - but Mr. B decided we had to find some food 
first. We left the college and headed up the main street to find 
the local McDonalds. 
     We were quite surprised to see a car driving up the main 
street. This was surprising because it was a bricked over 
pedestrian area. A car raced up the street blaring  its horn 
causing people to leap out of the way. A minute later, three 
police cars came hurtling round the corner, sirens blazing. A car 
chase - we don't get them in Abermule!
     Irish McDonalds tasted very similar to English McDonalds. I 
was expecting it to be called O'Donalds! After we'd finished our 
healthy meals (Cheeseburger, fries and coke!), we headed for the 
student bar. We crept past the debating hall and up into the 
student bar and immediately plastic cups full of alcoholic 
beverages were thrusts into our hands. I'd only got two vodkas 
down me when the crowd from the debate came. Up I chatted to one 
of the Irish debators who was extremely funny and he advised me 
just to fill my speech with jokes.
     As the student I was talking to was behind the bar, he 
wouldn't let me have an empty cup. He gave me another vodka, a 
Gin and Tonic, and a whiskey. Then the stunning looking girl who 
was also behind the bar persuaded me to try a tequila. I had a 
cup full and it tasted like poison. I'd started on a 
whiskey and coke (80% whiskey, 20% coke!) when I was told that 
our party was going back to the hotel. They almost had to drag 
from the bar! Free drinks, interesting conversation and nice 
women, what more could you ask for.
     As you can imagine, as I got out into the fresh air, I was 
starting to feel the effect of the alcohol. I accused all of the 
Scottish team of being called Angus. I then stood in the middle 
of the main street of Dublin and shouted obscenities. Etiquette 
has never been my strong point. 
     We headed back to the hotel and by that time we'd made 
friends with the scottish team. One of them, Ian Hulse, beared an 
uncanny resemblence to Spaz, same hair style with leather jacket 
and same spectacles. We found a table and ordered some Irish 
Guinness which is absolutely beautiful. I managed to find my way 
to the toilets, but when I got out I was so disorientated it took 
me a while to find the table again.
     We finished our pints and went up to our rooms. I was dead 
and slept in such an awkward way I nearly dislocated my shoulder!
     The next day I felt fine - I don't usually get hangovers. I 
head a spanking continental breakfast (Toast and tea!) and then 
we headed into Dublin. Transport is very expensive! We talked 
about the revolution of 1916 and we visited the GPO where it all 
black "DUBLIN - CITY OF CULTURE 1991" T-Shirt.
     We had a meal at Anne's cafe, and it was an average meal. 
For some reason they never charged me for my shepard pie and 
chips, just for my drink and eclair!
     After this we headed back to the Hotel and got our speeches 
ready. Dids was getting very worked up and he was trying to 
commit his whole speech to memory. I was taking the cool, laid 
back attitude - i.e. Sod this, I'm going to watch the T.V.
     About half an hour before the main meal, I decided I needed 
a haircut, and as there was a hair saloon in the complex, Nia and 
I decided to find it.       
     As there were few customers they started on us immediately. 
My cut was smart enough and cost œ5. Nia had a wash-blow-shave-
wet-dry-cut which took ages and cost her the princely sum of œ14! 
What a rip off! She was well gutted! It didn't look any different 
either, a fact which I delighted in telling her. 
     Then it was the meal, but I feel calling it this is over 
complementing it. The starter was fruit with cocktail sticks, the 
sticks were virtually inedible. Then came soup with bread. I was 
the only person on our table who ate it. Half way through this 
there was almost a phone call for me. The receptionists kept 
announcing that there was a call for what sounded like Leon 
O'Reilly so I decided to check it out, besides it would give me a 
chance to checkout the secretary again. It turned out the call 
was for a Mr Noel O'Reilly. How backwards of me.
     The main course duly arrived, and I wished it hadn't. It 
consisted of very salty mashed potatoes, stringy, fatty beef, 
lumpy gravy and a variety of vegetables that were neither the 
right shape or colour. It was sickening, but it didn't stop me 
from wolfing down the next course, Gateaux and thick cream.
     I was feeling slightly queasy after this viscous assault on 
my taste buds, but I still made the short trip to university 
college Dublin. Once we got there we met on of the organisers, a 
very smart girl of my height who Mr B fell for immediately. She 
led me and Dids to a 'free' room where we could perfect our 
speech. Two minutes later a class burst into this room and we had 
to leave, we ended up working on our speeches in the main hall 
where there were many distractions.
     I made my speech into a legible note form and went through 
it once before we were summoned to gather together. I met the 
English team for the first time and what pretentious Amigas they 
were. They appeared to have no christian name,
     "Hi! I'm Mr Dixon, and this is Mr Saufer."
     Bugger off you stuck up Public school gits!
     We were led down stairs and through tunnels into the bowls 
of the university until we were outside the 'performers' entrance 
of the debating hall. This was the most nerve racking experience 
of the whole weekend. We waited two minutes, and then we 
cautiously went in. We saw the crowd for the first time - a 
multitude of rowdy students, about two hundred of them. The 
chamber represented the coliseum in Rome and I felt like one of 
the Christians who was about to be thrown to the Lions.
     Once I was seated, most of nerves went. The Irish proposed 
the motion, then Scotland spoke against, Angus's arguments being 
particularly cohesive and cutting. I had a scare when they 
announced it was my turn to speak and it wasn't. When my turn 
came, it was with trepidation that I marched up to the platform 
and plonked down my amazingly well researched speech - that I'd 
written in the half-an-hour previous.
     My greeting was a bit shaky, but the first sheet of my 
speech was reasonably interesting and the crowd definitely 
appreciated the jokes in debate devoid of humour up till then. 
Once I got half way through the speech I lost the public and also 
the most important sheet of my speech. I had to give an impromptu 
speech about ham and its relevance to Palestine. I used Trevor's 
Shop (the general stores in Abermule) as a similie representing 
the conflict in Palestine - thats how desperate I was.
     Apart from this I got through my speech without any stammers 
or mistakes and I took points of information well enough. I 
finished a little early, but at least I'd put in a reasonable 
performance and I'd kept my reputation - though I'd slaughtered 
Angus's reputation during a point of information.
     I sat down very relieved. It was all over. I just wanted to 
get out as I was feeling sick. Dids got up and started his 
speech. I wanted to cry. He stuttered all the way through it, 
lost his place, didn't complete sentences, reacted awfully to 
points of information and generally made an ass of himself. When 
he was trying to make a joke about Harry Krishna, the wrong words 
came out and he said
     "there are Christians and there are Catholics"
     This got the biggest boo of the night and various 
projectiles were hurled at him. He finished a confused speech to 
jeers and whistles. When he sat down, I didn't speak to him. I 
knew we'd lost. He then started raising the most ridiculous 
points of information. On of the English poked fun at the Welsh 
rugby team saying their season had been as disastrous as Dids's 
speech. Dids immediately shouted out that he didn't support the 
welsh team, he supported the english one which was a pretty 
stupid thing to say considering he was representing Wales. This 
got the second biggest boo of the night. The things he said after 
just rubbed salt into the room. Mr B left the chamber muttering 
that he needed a fag. I needed a fag, and I don't even smoke! I 
decided then and there that I was going to get seriously pissed 
that night. 
     The debate was over from our point of view and the 
audjudicators left to make their decision. I knew we had no 
chance, and I thought that the English were too arrogant to win 
it. I thought the Irish had a chance even thought they hadn't 
rebutted well. 
     Some students came down from out of the crowd and started 
speaking. I just wanted to get out of the room as quickly as 
possible and get to the party. Various students spoke for about 
half an hour, then the audjicators returned, to my great relief. 
It was announced that the winners of the debate were Scotland. I 
was pleased because the Scots were good lads, and also good 
friends. 
     We were then put through a torturous photo session. We had 
millions of different photos with different arrangements of 
groups, the Welsh team with the chairman of the bank of Ireland, 
group photos and more.
     "They treat you like cattle!" I exclaimed as I was getting 
pissed off. The photographer looked at me reproachfully.
     "Oh you lil' divil!" She exclaimed.
     After this arduous task was finished I looked round the 
audotorium. It was just about empty, most of the students had 
left immediately after the result had been announced. I was 
therefore surprised to see two very nice looking students still 
seated at the front of the room. Even more surprising was the 
fact that they were staring at me.
     "But he's small." One said.
     Her friend sighed longingly.
     "Yes I know, but he's so cute!"
     Cute! Aaargh! Don't call me cute! Even so, I would forgive a 
girl of her calibre for this statement. Unfortunately I couldn't 
get away from the photographers etc. and the two girls left with 
warmth touching there hearts. I wished I could have gone with 
them!
     When we finally got out, I went straight to the toilets and 
was sick, though this wasn't my initial reason for going. I felt 
fine though. I went out and tried to relocate my group.
     "Where's the party?" I enquired of the girl who'd been 
behind Trinity college bar the night before.
     "Follow me." She said, and who wouldn't.
     There was a reception being held in a reasonably large room. 
All the teams and their tutors were there along with the 
organisers, audjiudicators and members of Irish debating 
societies. There was a great spread of food laid out, but what 
caught my eye was the glasses of wine. I made a bee-line for 
these and drunk two before I started talking to anyone. Even once 
I'd got with a group of friends, I moved away every few minutes 
to get a fresh glass of wine until the supply had run out. Then I 
had to be cunning and pilfer other people's wine while they were 
not looking. 
     I moved over to where the wine was being poured and bumped 
into the girl from Trinity again and got talking. I accused her 
of trying to poison me. She said she was just trying to get me 
pissed and I reassured her that it would never work. 
     I left her and had to slide conspicuosly across the table to 
get my next glass of wine. Then I went to the end of the table to 
get a refill and a very nice, tall, blond student called Hilary. 
I chatted to her about the merits of Ireland and how lovely 
Dublin and its people were and how clean it was. She told me that 
people were even friendlier when you got out of Dublin and into 
other parts of Ireland. The conversation was so enthralling that 
I only managed two glasses of wine during it. 
     Then came the ominous tap on the shoulder. It was time to 
go. I said goodbye to Hilary, then a wild notion hit me. I 
reached across the table and grabbed two bottles of wine. One was 
wrestled from by Sarah Hewwit, but I marched away triumphantly 
with the other one.
     We left the building, I had carefully concealed the bottle 
in my jacket - not very effectively. Once we were outside I 
started to swig it back. I had already had miles too much and I 
started to salute everyone who passed us. 
     I then decided that the fate of universe rested on me being 
able to crawl through a hoop at the side of the road. I did and 
this is last thing I remember.
     I woke up at around ten the next morning. That's strange, I 
thought, I don't remember going to bed. Infact I don't remember 
even reaching the hotel. I felt a plaster on my finger. How did 
that get there.
     "What happened? Where did this plaster come from?"
     "You don't remember?" Dids replied, aghast.
     "No."
     "You don't remember me having to stay up half the night 
looking after you as you threw up all over the room?"
     I was laughing now. Poor sod.
     I extracted the whole story of the sordid events of that 
night. When walking (stumbling?) back to the hotel, I'd fallen 
way behind the rest of my group and I was singing Vic Reeves 
songs and saluting everyone who went passed. Once I'd finished my 
bottle, I tossed it aside. It smashed and I promptly fell into it 
cutting myseld.
     Dids and Mr B had to carry and push me the rest of the way. 
By the time we got to the hotel I was caked in blood and so were 
Mr B's chinos and Dids's best jacket. Mr B had to carry me past 
the audjudicators who stared at me distastefully and the leader of 
the English team passed us in the corridor. He gave me an 
unbelievably condescending look.   
     Once I was in my room, the tried to find the source of all 
the blood, expecting a gash on my head. They were shocked to find 
that it was only a tiny cut on my finger. They bandaged it up and 
chucked me into bed. They said that I then did my impression of 
the fountains in Dublin by lying on my back and puking up in the 
air. Mr B promptly fetched the bin and optimistically put a 
piece of tissue in the bottom of it which would soak up all the 
sick. I filled the whole bin up!
     Dids didn't enjoy his night to much - but then holding my 
head in a waste paper bin is hardly a spectator sport. Looking 
round the hotel room I was shocked to find blood over the walls, 
on the door frame and even on the corridor outside. I cleaned 
them off - what a responsible chap I am!
     I didn't feel like breakfast that morning, but surprisingly 
I didn't have a hangover. We cleared out our rooms and packed all 
our stuff and put in Mr B's room. We got ready and we decided 
we'd explore the sights of Dublin.
     We met up with the Scottish team and took an expensive and 
monotonous bus trip into the centre of Dublin. From there we 
walked about two miles to the Guinness brewery which was 
interesting to wonder round. At the end of it we got a free pint, 
and it was delicious - much nicer than English Guinness, smoother, 
creamier and not so sharp. It goes down so easily, it's 
frightening. We went to the Guinness souvenir shop. I fell in 
love with a Guinness watch, but I couldn't afford one so I bought 
five pencils.
     After this tour, we walked back into the centre of Dublin. 
We stopped off for lunch - I had a lasagne which I didn't feel up 
to eating, though I still ploughed through most of it. Nia had a 
turtle cake which tasted disgusting.
     We then made our well to Trinity college and the book of 
kells souvenir shop. Nia got a Trinity college bag as a status 
symbol and Mr B bought a family tree poster which he will fill in 
with pride. We said our farewells to the Scottish team, and 
started a long, tortuous quest for a taxi - and found a goldmine.
     We hijacked a taxi that had stopped at the traffic lights, 
and its driver was a real character. He made the journey back 
most entertaining with his varied tales. He told us about some of 
the famous people he'd driven about. He'd transported Jack 
Charlton (Republic of Ireland football manager) three times, he'd 
driven the Edge of U2 about and Sinead O'Conner, who he described 
as stunning - especially her eyes - but much smaller than you'd 
expect.
     He also told us about the down side of taxi driving, and how 
he'd been assaulted in the rougher areas of Dublin. He'd had a 
gun to his head, and a rope round his neck in two robberies. The 
most frightnening experience he'd had was when a women clutching 
a syringe full of blood got in the taxi and threatened to give 
him the AIDs virus.
     The comments he was making to other drivers and people 
walking in the street were hilarious. He also dismissed women 
drivers as useless and told some interesting stories about the 
Montrose hotel. 
     The ride with him was probably the highlight of the day. We 
then went up to Mr B's room and watched some Irish television. 
The childrens' television presenters are amazing. There is one 
man surrounded by about six different grotesque looking puppets. 
All this puppets have individual voices and start singing and 
shouting whenever they feel like it. The overall effect is 
chaotic with at least two people speaking at the same time all 
the time.
     After this we saw Home and Away which is about few months ahead 
of us, and it's still crap.
     After this dose of Irish TV we set off to the seaport. When 
we arrived, Mr B said.
     "Right, get out your tickets."
     Tickets? What tickets? Nia and Dids had kept them safely in 
their wallets. I had no idea where mine was. So I had to open my 
suitcase and completely unpack it, rumaging through all the 
compartments and clothes in a desperate attempt to locate the 
œ32 ticket. I knew I didn't have anywhere near enough money to 
buy another one so if I couldn't find it, I'd be stranded in 
Dublin. I wouldn't mind this too much though....eventually I 
found it in a back pocket of my jeans.
     We boarded the ferry and it was a very rough crossing. Dids 
spent most of the journey lying down upstairs. I felt Ok. I just 
sipped my strongbow and read my Assimov. Dids bought 24 cans of 
foster for œ10 at the duty free - bargain city! Mr B got 24 cans 
of Guinness for œ14. I wished I'd had enough money to get 
something!
     Later I went for a stroll on deck in the dark in the rain. I 
t was an interesting experience. I then went back down and went 
to sleep at my table to the strains of Chris Rea's Daytona. We 
debated on taking a cold Pizza up to David to see what reaction 
this would provoke in him!
     Once we got off the ferry, Dids found a trolley like thing 
which we placed all our cases and cans on. We manouvered this to 
the car park where a women was having trouble getting her car 
started. Being the gentlemen we are we gave her a push.
     We then boarded the minibus and went to sleep for the 
journey home. I woke up in Welshpool (it has that effect on most 
people!) and guided the Minibus to my humble abode. There I said 
goodbye to the rest of my valiant team and made the treacherous 
walk through the forest in the dark clutching my cases.
     Finally I saw the lights of Cwm Towers, and sighed with 
happiness. Dublin may be the best city in the world, but it has a 
severe lack of STs!
