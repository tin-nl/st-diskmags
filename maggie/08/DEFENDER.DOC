                        ARC       Review by Tartiana

    Three games in one box! "Wow!" I hear you say. No you don't because they
are the same game with three different names (All writen by Jeff Minter (The
guy with the Llama fixation)). Defender is a conversion of the original
williams arcade game and has the graphics to match. Stargate is a conversion of
the williams follow-up to defender. Defender II is the two of them rolled into
one.
    The title screen gives you the options of playing either of the three
games, playing the trainer, going to the options screen or reading some
background information about the game. There is also some quartet music (Which
you can load into quartet as there is no protection on the disk). The options
screen allows you to change the number of ships and bombs you start of with,
the difficulty level and the graphics and sound options. The graphics can be
set to 'original' (Tiny little sprites with limited colour) or 'Modern' (More
colour on the sprites but they are still the same size). The sound can be
either on or off.
    The information screen tells you about the history of the two aracde games
and fills the screen with little Pink Floyd logos (This guy has taste!).
    The trainer introduces you to your weapons and the aliens while giving you
infinite bombs and energy and also making you invincable.
    Loading up Defender 1 you are shown your tiny ship and the landscape of
mountain outlines. Little people are walking along the mountains and you must
defend them (Hence the name). If one of the wee guys is captured he is
mutalated and turns into an alien. You can however rescue captured people by
blasting the alien holdin him and catching him before goes splat on a
mountainside.
    Talking of blasting let me tell you about your weapons. You have a front
rapid-fire laser and a limited number of smart bombs (Not really smart, they
just kill everything). The control system takes a wee while to get used to as
it uses both the keyboard and the mouse (This can be set to just the keyboard
on the options screen). The mouse is used to move your ship verticaly with the
buttons controling your engines. The weapons are controled by the keyboard.
    There are loads of baddies of several types. Once you have killed them all
you go on to the next level which is exactly the same except there are more
aliens. Once the aliens overcome you (they will eventually) you may get to put
your name on the highscore table. This game scores zero on long term interest
because the only incentive to carry on playing is to get a higher score and to
a level with a higher number than the last one.
    Stargate plays the same as Defender I with a couple of differences. Holding
down the Alternate key makes you invisible for a limited amount of time and
there is the stargate. Normaly flying into the stargate will take you to the
other side of the playing area but there are two exceptions to this. If a human
has been captured the stargate will take you to the scene of the crime and if
you fly into the stargate with four humans on your ship you can jump three
levels ahead. There also a couple of new breeds of baddie.
    Defender II is a mix of the other two with the same gameplay again and a
stargate (There is also an alien that looks like a stargate so be carefull).
The main improvement here is the new weapons. Your ship has several new weapons
and a limited amout of energy to use them with. These range from the toothpaste
laser which is very powerful to a bomb dropping pod and a pod which lines up
with bad guys and fires when you do. The best new weapon however is the smart
laser which can fire at an alien in any position on the screen. Another
addition is that every fifth level is a mission level with a task for you to
complete.
    These game are okay for a simple blast but there are much better
shoot-em-ups available (Turrican II which should be reviewed else where in this
issue (If the Lost Boys have put it in)). Sound is reasonable but the graphics
are crap.
