Well here we are again,  with what looks like a hopeful trickle of 
releases for this machine,  if not a flood yet,  some of the stuff 
reviewed below, has been around for a while, but there is at least 
one new one...

First off,  the STE Boink demo, which is a single screen, probably 
one  meg  needed to run,  upon loading,  you are presented with  a 
single  large  bouncing  ball,  with  rasters  inside  it,  and  a 
three dimensional background, to give the impression that the ball 
is enclosed on three sides, with the fourth side being the screen, 
a looping sample of.......  Axel F. plays, and you think, oh dear, 
why do people have no imagination...

The  next  demo,  whose name I cannot recall,  may well be the STE 
Scroll  demo,  or  movie  demo,  loads in a Cyber-Sculpt type  3-D 
object,  and plays a longish,  sampled tune, which is probably cut 
and spliced rather than a MOD, and has a tiny (French) scrolltext, 
and some very dodgy rasters indeed...  (In fact, a demo which I am 
involved  in,and  which is a first effort,  which is still at  the 
'Hundreds of unconnected bits of code and graphix and music' stage 
has  some rather better Cyber-Sculpt objects and rasters,  and  we 
are nowhere near ready yet.. (If ever??))

The  best  of  the current crop of single-screeners,  is  the  STE 
Fantasia  Demo,  which features a control panel on the bottom half 
of  the screen,  and various 3-D shapes which appear,  in a manner 
not  dissimilar to the 'Life's a Bitch' or Overlanders  'European' 
3-D screens.  This time,  you are able to control the shapes,  via 
the mouse or keyboard,  there is also a very good sample, which is 
looped,  but done in such a way, as to not be noticable, the music 
seems to be from a song by the Cure..  Overall, a nice screen, but 
nothing there, which has not already been done on the STFM..

I think,  with the single-screen demos,  wait for the compilations 
to come out, these are ok, but not brilliant value for money..

The  last  review leads me on to a demo I picked up at  the  16bit 
Fair  in  July.  This appears to be another French  creation,  and 
consists of four screens..

1. This one has rasters flying all over the place, and is there to 
demonstrate   the  extra  clours,   as  the  centre  screen  piece 
announces,  "STE  4096  COLORS",  and bounces up and down a bit.  A 
looping sample plays..

2.  The  second screen has both upper and lower border scrolls and 
rasters, scrolltexts being in french, and the centre screen having 
a  moving  multi-patterned  background with an  "STE"  logo moving 
around in the centre..

3. A multi-layer scrolltext (About 10-11) which can be adjusted to 
go very fast,  or slow,  more rasters, and - EEuurrgg! - Soundchip 
music..

4. The best screen of the lot, the lower border has a fairly large 
scrolling section, the main screen features a picture of a unicorn 
in a countryside setting, and a magnifier roams around portions of 
the screen,  highlighting certain areas.  The sample is an excerpt 
from  Jean  Michel Jarre's "Rendezvous" album,  and is short,  but 
effective...

This demo,  whilst hardly spectacular, is a nice one, but does not 
seem to have a name,  could whoever wrote this,  write in and tell 
us who did it??

After  getting  my  STE  back,  I also tried out  the  demo  patch 
proggie,  in Maggie 7,  on an unsuspecting Cuddly Demo, and whilst 
the  screens  work  fine,  the main menu,  is well,,,  lets get  a 
bucket,  I  need  to  throw up again..  But it is nice to see  old 
friends, such as the Spreadpoint screen, on the STE..

Anyway,  that  will  do for this issue,  if anyone has any new STE 
demos  they are about to unleash on an unsuspecting world,  please 
send them to us,  as we would like to tell people about them,  and 
review them...

Also,  if  anyone  is thinking of doing any Versions of the  Amiga 
ANTI-LEMMINGS demo (This was the best demo at the 16bit fair,  but 
needed a 2mb Amiga to run..) WE NOW HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY,  as there 
were some 1mb Simms doing bird impressions at the 16bit (IE. Going 
cheap...And yes I know it was your joke Leon...) So, if there  are 
any 2mb demos, send them in as well...

All for now, Chris H..  4/8/91
