Guess what Super Cars 2 is. Come on, think hard. I'll give you  
clue, it's something to do with the game Super Cars. Still can't 
get it? God, your hopeless! Well unless you have the intelligence 
of a fried egg then you would have been able to work out that 
Super Cars 2 is the sequel to that great classic Super Cars. The 
original Super Cars was a looking from above racing game in which 
you pit your wits against the best of the computer drivers. Super 
Cars 2 uses the same type of format.
   Once you have got past the intro screen you are presented with 
the following menu:

                     DIFFICULTY LEVEL:

                           Easy
(you can change between easy, medium and hard)

                     NUMBER OF PLAYERS:

                            One
(You have the choice of 1 or 2 players)

                         PLAYER 1:

                         Player 1
(You can change this to your own name)
                     Fire to Accelerate
(There are two control methods to choose from, either fire to 
accelerate or fire to brake)
                 
                         PLAYER 2:

                         Player 2
(Same as for player 1)
                     Fire to Accelerate
(same as for player 1)
                     Joystick in Port 1
(Player 2 can choose between using the second joystick port or 
using the keyboard)
                    COMMUNICATIONS SCREENS

                            Yes
(Yes or no, more about the comms screens later)

Once you have completed all your choices on the above menu you 
can press fire to start the game. In the race there are ten cars 
including your own. All computer cars are coloured grey, player 
1's car is red and player 2's car (if there is a player 2) is 
green. You start the race last on the grid and have to work your 
way through the field. If a car is really getting in your way you 
can try to blow it up with the missiles which are attached to 
your car. However you only start with about 3 front and 3 back 
missiles so you have to use them sparingly. Also the computer 
cars can try to blow you up as they have missiles aswell. You 
have to complete the race in the top five to continue on to the 
next track. If you have chosen "Yes" for comms screens then after 
the race you will be taken to one of the communication screens. 
If you answer questions correctly you can gain extra championship 
points or extra money, but if you get the questions wrong you can 
be fined either points or money. Here is a quick list of all the 
comms screens I can remember:

Road Safety Test: Here you are tested on your road safety. For 
example you are shown a road sign and you have to pick which of 
the three answers you are given is correct. If you get the first 
question wrong you will be fined 5 championship points (this is 
quite alot as 5 points is the amount of points you get for coming 
first in a race). If you get the first question right then you 
will be fined less for getting the next question wrong. If you 
keep getting the questions right then you will start to be 
awarded extra points up to a maximum of 5.

Pollution test: You have to persuade the pollution people that 
you are enviromently friendly. The more quesitons you get right 
the less you are fined (in money terms). However, even if you get 
all the quesitons right you are not given any extra money.

Journalist test: You have to talk to a journalist and try and get 
him to give you loads dosh. If you answer the first question 
incorrectly you will just get no money. The more questions you 
get right the more moeny he will give you to print your story.

Police Test: You have been summoned by the police for being a 
naughtly boy (or girl). You will be fined if you get the 
questions wrong, and just get no money if you get them all right.

Sponsor Test: You have to talk with your sponsors and try to get 
them to give you more money. The more questions you answer 
correctly the more money you get.

Will test: Strange one this, your great grandfather (or someone 
like that) has died and you have to try to get has much money 
from the will as possible. Again, the more questions you get 
right the more dosh you get.

Those are all the ones I can think of at the moment. Anyway, 
after this bit you are shown the damage on your car and are 
given an oppartunity to buy new parts to repair it. Unlike in the 
first Super Cars you can not buy a new car. After this bit you 
have the option to buy new weapons for your car. These range from 
the normal front and back missiles (very cheap), to things like 
homing missiles, mines, armour, turbo boost etc. The cost of all 
these things varies from track to track but as a rule the better 
something is the more it costs. As a restriction you can only 
have two types of missile in use for one track. This is explained 
by the diagram below:

Lay out of Joystick:

                         1
                       2   3
                     4   5   6
                       7   8
                         9

1: (pushing up on the joystick) activates the chosen front 
missile.

2 and 3: Makes car move diagonally.

4 and 6: Left and right.

5: keeps you going in the direction you last pulled in.

7 and 8: I think these just make you go left and right.

9: activates the chosen back missile.

Once you have chosen what stuff you want, or what stuff you can 
afford, the next race starts.

EFFECTS

The grafixxxx in the game aren't bad but they're nothing special. A 
nice effect is the way the car sprite changes as you go up or 
down hills. The scenary off the track, while far better than Super 
Cars 1, is not that amazing. Scrolling is smooth enough and the 
actual movement of the cars is quite good. However I think having 
all the computer cars as grey is a bit boring. It would have been 
nice to see the different drivers with different colours and 
characteristics. The muzix in the intro and betweens races is 
quite good, but because it is soundchip it does tend to give you 
a headache after a while.

VERDICT

One of the main disapointments with Super Cars 1 was that you 
could not have a 2 player option. This is the best extra that has 
been put into Super 2. 
   When I first played Super Cars 2 I didn't think it was that 
good. When you begin and you are not used to computer cars 
shooting at you it can be very annoying. However once you get 
used to dodging missiles and aiming your own carefully it becomes 
more enjoyable to play. When you play on two player the screen is 
split in half and you can't see very far in front of you, so to 
begin with you will keep bumping into everything. Again, with a 
bit of practice you will be able to zoom round the course easily. 
2 player is definately the best option in the game. The difficulty 
level is just right aswell. It shouldn't take you too long to complete 
the easy and medium, but it will take a mean driver to finish all 
the hard tracks, especially the last one.
   The comms screens can be bloody annoying at first. You can
feel like shooting your computer when you are tieing neck and 
neck for the championship and you are suddenly fined 5 points. 
They are okay for a fun game, but if you are playing a 2 player 
with a friend it is better to leave them off.
