                    Review by Donatello of SPI

There have been quite a few Tennis simms made for the ST, but 
most of them, unfortunately, have been about as playable as a wet 
piece of lettuce. UBI Soft are hoping to brake this mould with 
their new game, Pro Tennis Tour 2.
   Once the game has loaded an intro screen appears with a piccy 
of a cup and the writing Pro Tennis Tour 2 written above it. Some 
digi muzix starts to play which is okay but nothing special. 
Press space and a menu appears. Firstly you need to set the 
parameters for the game. Here you can decide whether you want to 
be a man or a woman (sex change is very simple), and can also 
change certain atributes like fore hand voley etc. For the 
beginner there is a function where the computer moves your player 
about the court and you just press fire to hit the ball, pulling 
the joystick in the direction you want the ball to go. After 
having a few goes playing at that level you will probably choose 
to control your own player. For this you move around the court 
using the joystick (suprise suprise) and once you are in position 
to hit the ball you press to fire to stop you player. While the 
fire button is still pressed you can pull the joystick in the 
direction you want the ball to travel. Releasing the fire button 
makes you whack out at the ball, hopefully hitting a winner.
   To begin with controlling your own player can be quite 
difficult and so there is a practice mode where a machine shoots out 
balls and you have to try to return them. You can also have one 
match friendlies agains the computer or a friend, before you 
start you can decide whether you want to play on grass, clay or 
on an indoor surface. Also on a friendly you can choose between a 
singles, doubles, or a 2 against 1 game. So if your feel your 
game is not up to scratch you can play with a computer player 
against 1 computer player on the other side. 
   Once you think you have mastered the game enough you can enter 
competitions such as Wimbledon and play against the best of the 
best. In these matches the type of court you play on is the same 
as in the real tournaments and before you play you have to decide 
whether you will be entering the single or doubles championship. 
The number of rounds you have to play is also the same as in the 
real thing (I think) and the more rounds you win, the more money 
you earn.
   Oh yeah, although you can decide to play a bloke or a lass, 
you can only play mixed doubles if you have 1 meg of memory or 
more.

EFFECTS

Although the muzix at the start of the game is digi muzix it 
still isn't very good. The muzix played on the main menu is 
soundchip buy you can listen to it with out getting a headache. 
The sound FX from hitting the ball is quite disapointing and the 
sampled voice that gives the scores is much to quiet. The Tennis 
players themselves are very nice and the animation is realistic. 
The tennis court is, rather disapointingly, all one colour, for 
example there are no marks on the grass court where the people 
stand to serve like there is in real life. There are no ball 
boys/girls, or line judges present and the umpire and net judge 
(I think there is a net judge) never move.

VERDICT

When me and Mike first played this game using the computer 
controls your player function we thought it was really good. 
Infact we almost thought it deserved the title "The Kick Off 2 
off tennis games". However when you control your own player you 
soon realise how slow he/she actually moves. For instants, if you 
are on the far left of the court and hit the ball, even if you 
start running immediately you cannot get to the other side of the 
court in time to hit the returned ball. The way you serve is 
quite user friendly. Once you get used to it, it is quite easy to 
go a whole set without serving a double fault. However, because 
you use a cursor to pin point where you want the ball to go, your 
opponent can easily see where you are going to place your serve 
and can move their player, before you have even hit the ball, to 
be in the right positon to whack a good return of serve back at 
you. 
   Pro Tennis Tour 2 is the best tennis game I have played on the 
ST but there are still alot of not very nice things about it. It 
is good fun to play though, especially with friends (although it 
can be very frustrating). I would reckomend you save a bit more 
and instead of buying this game, get a tennis racket a play the 
real thing. It's better than sitting around in front of your 
computer playing games (or typing reviews!) all day!!
