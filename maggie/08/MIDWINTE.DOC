Once  upon  a  time,  there  was a really  great  game,  featuring 
innovative graphics, and unparalled depth of gameplay, released by 
Rainbird,  and  there was much joy,  and absolutely no wailing and 
gnashing of teeth, throughout the land...

So,  following the success of the original MIDWINTER, there was no 
surprise  whatsoever,  when  it  was announced there  would  be  a 
sequel, this being released in the 'Spring' of 1991...

The multitudes waited, and waited...

......And waited some more....

It eventually came to pass,  that a tiny voice whispered in my ear 
"It's out..." I said "Really??"

And lo, MIDWINTER burst forth before the assembled multitudes once 
more, in its sparkling new FLAMES OF FREEDOM guise..

Having  notched up an incredible BPM (Bullshit Per Minute)  count, 
it's on to the review proper....

You  can  tell this is a Rainbird game,  immediately,  by the huge 
box,  and  huge  pricetag (œ33-34 - Oh dear) But,  as is often the 
case,  the  game  is  a three-disk epic,  there being,  a program, 
graphics and mission disk,  along with keyboard overlay, and large 
manual...

The  plot follows on from the events described in  MIDWINTER,  the 
army  of General Masters having been successfully defeated,  there 
is  the  new  problem  of rising  seas,  and  the  inhabitants  of 
Midwinter  find their way to the friendly island of Agora..   This 
is  the only friendly island,  the other 41 are under the despotic 
thumb  of the Saharan Empire..  You may think 'El tougho shito' as 
far  as they are concerned,  but the Saharan Empire wants the full 
set of 42,  which means you!! So as a field agent of COBRA (Covert 
Operations  Bureau)  you are charged with the  task  of  delaying, 
impeding,  wrecking,  sticking a grade 'A' spanner in the works of 
the  Saharan  invasion fleet,  by subverting as many of the  other 
islands as possible...

There  is  the option of playing a straight 'arcade'  mode,  or  a 
single island,  or a full campaign,  if you have a gamedisk, and a 
lot of time, as this is a much bigger game, than even the original 
MIDWINTER... 

FLAMES OF FREEDOM puts you in a H.Q.  corridor, with the option to 
go  on  raids  (single  island) a  full  campaign,  training  (For 
different   types  of  vehicles  and  situations)  and  also   the 
personality and face creation bit..

There are 22 different modes of transport, ranging from the scenic 
but  fairly  useless  balloon,  to rather  brilliant  things  like 
minisubs,  flying subs, biplanes, and jetpacks.. To sample each of 
these, in training mode, just click on the icon and...... Wait..

I  will  discuss this in more detail later,  but one of the  first 
things  that  strikes  you,  is  the very  large  amount  of  disk 
accessing that takes place in this game,  for example,  to load in 
part  of the training mode,  seems to take the best part of thirty 
seconds, and it is not much better in the main game itself...

Graphically, the game retains the first person perspective fractal 
landscape of the original, and manages to add a seascape where the 
waves wash up and down the shoreline, and this is a very nice game 
to look at and occasionally there are some spectacular views to be 
had  as  well..  The update is a tad sluggish,  and there are real 
problems  in keeping everything going if there are a lot of  enemy 
objects  in  the  vicinity,  when  the  3-D  routines  are  really 
struggling..   There   are   several  very  nicely  drawn   static 
'Inbetween'  screens as well..  Reservations about the 3-D  update 
aside, this is a very classy looking game indeed...

There are road and railway networks, and villages of various types 
of  building,  in addition to the many kinds of vehicle,  and also 
the  inevitable  tropical  palm  trees  dotted  about  the  place, 
generally,  more varied,  graphically... There is also a night and 
day mode,  and in the darkness, it is advisable to use your infra-
red  goggles,  which displays the landscape in different shades of 
green...

Also  following on from the original,  the famous fractal maps are 
included,  and  improved,  to show a variety of different kinds of 
views,  including  underwater  topography,  and  the positions  of 
friendly islanders and enemy forces..

Sonically,  there  were going to be 'Context driven sampled tunes' 
but  it  seems that memory restrictions have  overtaken  this,  as 
there  are  some very bog-standard soundchip tunes  occupying  the 
title and credits sequences (Which can be turned off - thankfully) 
and  various  soundchipped  spot  fx,   such  as  waves  crashing, 
birdsong, 'tropical' noises etc, which work surprisingly well..

In  order  to  complete a single mission,  you require  a  certain 
amount  of  skill in persuading the islanders to  help,  different 
people can be bribed, reasoned, threatened, or seduced (Oooh-errr) 
and  there  is no guarantee that the supposed  helpful  resistance 
fighter  won't turn you over to the Saharan Secret police for  the 
price  of a packet of Prawn Cocktail flavoured crisps..  In  which 
case, your escape skills are going to be put into practice..

Like  MIDWINTER,  it is impossible for you to die,  your character 
can  take  a surprising amount of punishment,  and can  accomplish 
James Bond-like feats of commandeering enemy vehicles, almost on a 
minute  to minute basis,  in the midst of a big battle..  However, 
you can be injured, and tire out (run out of muscle power..)

Tasks to accomplish on a typical mission,  include assasination of 
a  key  enemy  person,   sabotage  of  a  major  installation,  or 
recruitment  of  a neutral,  important island native,  and often a 
combination  of  all  of  these on  some  of  the  more  difficult 
islands.. And you are given a range of personal weapons, such as a 
pistol,  assault rifle,  knife, or machine guns to 'do' the job... 
On playing the full campaign, your missions are supposed to add up 
to  delay the progress of the Saharan invasion fleet...  When this 
is launched,  all hell breaks loose,  and you are then expected to 
call  off your campaign of subversion to assist the Agoran  forces 
in trying to stop the Armada.. 

It  is  also possible to pick up various secret  weapons,  as  you 
complete certain missions,  which give either increased firepower, 
or enhanced detection capabilities..

Generally,  this is a very, very big game, with a huge and diverse 
range  of things to do,  it would need something like the Rainbird 
manual  (184 pages) to describe it fully,  before I move on to the 
end piece, however, the NOT SO GOOD NEWS...

I  have  already mentioned the sluggish 3-D  updating  in  certain 
situations  (Very  busy ones..) and also the huge amount  of  disk 
accessing...  The  3-D is probably the best that current ST's  can 
manage  for that sort of complexity,  and cannot really be helped, 
but  the  disk accessing is truly amazing,  and it seems  that  no 
account has been taken of ST's with 1 Meg or more,  of memory.. It 
would be possible for a ramdisk to be put in the extra memory, and 
for  certain  'common' sequences,  such as the map screen,  or the 
agents notebook to be kept in there,  as currently, EVERYTHING has 
to  be loaded in,  a typical loading sequence taking the best part 
of  thirty  seconds...  There is probably a case for a lot of  the 
'frilly'  bits  to be optional,  a cut-down version of  the  extra 
information screens could be enabled, instead, for people who want 
to  get  on  with the game quickly,  and not have to  sit  through 
umpteem disk-loads, in the middle of a battle...

Lastly,  this may be a game which is best installed on a hard-disk 
to  improve access times,  but it is unlikely to happen outside of 
any PC versions...

If  anybody at Rainbird or Maelstrom somehow happen to read  this, 
don't  be  discouraged,  we  need more Mega-games to  counter  the 
increasing numbers of Platform-games-with-a-film-star-on-the-box
such  as  we  seem  to get most of the time now,  but  what  is  a 
brilliant  game,  has  been compromised by having the  playability 
chopped about by lengthy disk-loading pauses...

Better luck next time guys..

RATINGS:-

GRAPHIX:-  90%  - Very attractive fractal  lightsourced  polygonal 
landscape,  I particularly enjoyed going underwater, and some very 
nice  still graphix,  (Good Artist!) The 3-D system sometimes ties 
itself into knots when there is a lot going on at the same time..

SONIX:- 67% - Nothing special here, some 'chuggy' soundchip tunes, 
and some nice continuous spot FX..

PLAYABILITY:-  74%  -  Let  down  severly  by  the  overlong  disk 
accessing  pauses,  you  start a mission,  then one sequence after 
another  has to be loaded in,  it is possible that 50% of the time 
is spent waiting for something to happen/appear....  Or maybe I am 
getting old/impatient??

OVERALL:-  81% - This is a massive game,  if you have the patience 
to  sit through the slow bits,  then it is worth persisting  with, 
anybody  of a 'Load up and go' frame of mind will be annoyed  with 
the  waiting  though...  This game may be too big for the  current 
generation of ST's - Worrying thought!?!?!?!
