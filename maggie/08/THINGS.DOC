  A few days ago I got this demo from Griff of Inner  Circle.  As 
Sammy Joe now lives in Germany near to my own home,  I decided to 
write some articles for his Disk Maggie.  And therefore I  tested 
the 'Things NOT to do'-demo.

THE INTRO:
----------
It starts with an ELECTRONIC IMAGES-logo which is drawn very well, 
continues with an 'of' and then with an excellent looking  'INNER 
CIRCLE'-logo.  There  is  a 'not so bad'-looking 'Things  NOT  to 
do'-logo  too.  It is a circle with the name of the demo  in  it. 
The  intro has good fade up and down effects and just reminds  me 
of the 'Syntax Terror'-demo.

After the intro the demo continues with a 3D starfield and a one
or two bit sinus scroller with an one plane font and some rasters
in it. It is a good loading screen but it took too long till the 
animations are loaded!

The first animation!

THINGS NOT TO DO: 1
-------------------
Two guys from the good old 'International Karate' appears on  the 
screen.  One of them is trying to break some pieces of wood  with 
his head.  After the try his head begins to bleed and the guy  is 
falling backwards to the ground - very nice (sadistic as I am!!)

Again  the  starfields appears (with new movement of  the  stars) 
but  now there is no scroller.  Just a text which tells us  about 
the credits for the demo.

THINGS NOT TO DO: 2
-------------------
DO NOT LET THIS........ HAPPEN TO YOU!
Two  Karatekas  are  standing  opposite.  The  left  one  gets  a 
machine-gun and shoots the other one.  After that he makes a loop 
and  as  he  landed in front of the dead body he  pissed  on  his 
head.
After all this messages appears: SO DO NOT LET PEOPLE SHOOT YOU 
IN THE GROIN AND PISS ON YOU!
Another splendid screen I think!!

After this second animation there comes the scroller again  which 
informs  us about a new demo called 'The Genetix Demo'  and  that 
the  INNER  CIRCLE are planning to do a copy party (hope  you  do 
one!)

THINGS NOT TO DO: 3
-------------------
.....DO NOT FIGHT WITH A BROTHER....
The left guy is smashed out of the screen border because of a hit 
of the other Karateka.
.......ESPECIALLY ONE STRONGER THAN YOU!!!!
Not the best one - not enough blood in it!!!!

Another  text which tells us that The Lost Boys and Inner  Circle 
are  friends  finally  and some more  special  messages  which  I 
forgot.

THINGS NOT TO DO: 4
-------------------
....DO NOT DAMAGE OTHERS PROPERTY
This is the best one of all animations I think.
You  see  one single guy at the screen who make some  kicks  with 
his foot. He kicks against the screen and damages it.
YOU BASTARD YOU'VE SMASHED MY SCREEN... appears......
OH ADDING INSULT TO INJURY
RIGHT....THEN DIE
On  the  left and right two other Karatekas  appear,  both  armed 
with a machine-gun.  KILL HIM..... and both guys begin to fire on 
the  poor  chap in the middle.  Just  look  yourself!  It's  very 
funny!

Again scroller and starfield!

THINGS NOT TO DO: 5
-------------------
...DO NOT LET SOMEONE ASSINATE.... YOU!
A  new  victim  stands  alone in the  middle  of  the  screen.  A 
crosshair searches for him,  finds him, message: LOCKED ON TARGET 
appears,  a  square  is zoomed on the man (looks  like  the  same 
effect as in 'Predator') and he is shot (tough shit for him!)
......BECAUSE IT HURTS...........

Again a text which contains some addresses and a  telephonenumber 
from Inner Circle. Nothing more to say about......

THINGS NOT TO DO: 6
-------------------
DO NOT HIT A BROTHER....
The third animation is repeated.
BECAUSE....... HE WILL BE BACK.......!!!
WITH A VENGENCE...... & A CHAINSAW!!!!
The man attacks the other with a chainsaw.  Hurts him at the  leg 
and  after this he saws him in his head and as an effect of  this 
the guy dies (understandable, otherwise he must be 'zombie'!)
DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!!!!
Much blood in the screen - I like it!

Another text just asking: "Do you like this 3D starfield??"

THINGS NOT TO DO: 7
-------------------
.....DO NOT GET CAUGHT BY A...... POSS'E
One  unarmed  guy in the middle of the screen encircled  by  many 
other guys who all are armed.  The screen vanishes and a new  one 
appears. Death by hanging - poor guy (hehehe - sadistic laugh!)
BECAUSE THEY WILL LYNCH YOU
I think I would like to do this with some guys too e.g. pusher,..

Just guess....... yes again the scroller.

THINGS NOT TO DO: 8
-------------------
DO NOT ARM UP BECAUSE SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A BIGGER.... 
WEAPON
Two guys, one armed with a chainsaw and one with a flamethrower.
Just guess who will survive.
THOSE WHO LIVE BY THE SWORD, SHOULD DIE BY THE SWORD.
OR THE CHAINSAW OR GUN, FLAMETHROWER???
This  is  also  a great screen and I like the  burned  and  still 
smoking body.

Now all animations are over and the endscreen runs.  Now  finally 
the  music  changes - thanks god!  The  4  voice-digi-music  from 
Count  Zero  isn't bad - NO!  But for this long demo  it  is  too 
short.  The  new music is fantastic.  But the rest you see  isn't 
such a master piece you perhaps waited for.  Only another  boring 
starfield  and  only an one plane text who tell you  the  credits 
again  and  a  list of all computers and programs  used  for  the 
demo.  The  greetings  are also in here.  The  only  thing  worth 
reading! (Sorry guys!)


General things to say about the demo:
-------------------------------------
There is no reset-part in the demo.  But why should there be one? 
The whole demo runs like a movie (there is no main menu).
Just  to mention that the coding is not as brilliant as  e.g.  in 
'Dark  Side Of The Spoon/ULM' but who cares?  There's no need  to 
remove all borders in every demo!  My opinon is that it is better 
to  do  a good 'normal' screen instead of a  'boring  like  hell' 
fullscreen.
This  demo shouldn't be missed in any demo collection.  It has  a 
brilliant new idea and it looks good enough for me to  say:  Keep 
on doing such good demos, Inner Circle!
