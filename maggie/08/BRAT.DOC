This  one  is a fairly unusual isometric platform  game,  you  are 
charged  with being the unseen guardian angel,  in charge of  Baby 
Nathan's  nightime adventures...  Well 'In Charge' is putting it a 
bit rashly,  as all you are really doing is working like a certain 
kind of insect with a blue posterior to keep him from disaster...

Baby Nathan is a little shitebag,  once he is asleep, and ditching 
his  nappy  for a metal-studded leather jacket,  and  some  'Cool' 
Bitmap-type  shades,  off he goes,  without a thought of where his 
next  adventure  will  lead  him..  So it is  over  to  you,  dear 
gamesplayer, to keep the glorious dream unfolding...

(You can tell this is padding out, to keep the article going until 
I get a chance to have a proper go at the game... Can't you?!?!  )

Having  refreshed the old braincells on what to do,  the game goes 
something like this...

There  is  a  quite good intro sequence,  where Nathan  crushes  a 
clockwork   mouse  with  a  "16  TON  type  weight",   grabs   the 
aforementioned  shades and jacket,  and with the cry "It's time to 
party dudes.." You are off into the main game itself....

The game takes place on an isometric platform suspended in midair, 
and  left to his own devices,  Nathan would keep plodding on,  and 
fall  off  the edge -GAMEOVER- so it is up to you  to  change  the 
direction  by planting little arrow icons in his path,  as you  do 
not have any direct control over his movements,  and this is where 
the game gets interesting..

The screen scrolls down at the same time as Nathan is  progressing 
down  the screen,  and if you linger too long on a section of  the 
game,  the  screen overtakes the child,  and it is the end of that 
life...  The  idea  is to get Nathan to the bottom of  the  level, 
picking up as many goodies,  food,  and money as possible,  as you 
need money to place icons, run out, and you are up a certain creek 
without a certain implement......

On all of the three levels,  there are mobile nasties which go for 
our  hero,  given the chance,  but you can pick up items en route, 
such as dynamite to blow up the killer cars,  and on the Park Land 
level,  you  can  position  torpedo-firing U-Boats in  the  watery 
stretches of the game, which do their stuff in the time hononoured 
manner... Overall, many humourous touches in this game...

Graphically,  very pleasing to look at, both in the animated intro 
sequences, and in the main game itself, well up to the accepted 16 
bit norms for this sort of game...

The  sonix is represented by a reasonable soundchip tune  and  the 
usual  spot  FX and also someb speech samples taken from  a  real, 
authentic child, for the intro and endgame sequence....

RATINGS:-

GRAPHIX:-  82%  - A quality isometric game,  with  some  excellent 
intro sequence animations..

SONIX:-  77% - Nothing special,  but nothing offensive to the ears 
either...

PLAYABILITY:-  81%  - You will either love or hate  the  different 
control  method which tends to get a bit fraught when  the  screen 
scrolling gradually catches up with Baby Nathan,  the game returns  
to the start of a level if you lose a life (Booo!!)

OVERALL:- 80% - I have just been to the pub for a few swift pints, 
and  personally (Can't Type to save my life at the moment..)  Like 
this game....
