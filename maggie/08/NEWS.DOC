                                   By Michael Schuessler


     Well, a lot has been going on lately, but strange enough not 
on the Atari ST.  Everybody seems to be shifting over to the IBM. 
This proves the theory,  that the ST market is slowly  dying.   I 
will  discuss the reasons for this another time.  Now on  to  the 
news:

Electronic Arts:
----------------
     They  have  been rather busy again,  there  is  one  problem 
though.  They appear to have forgotten the ST. Out of the 7 games 
they intend to or have recently released you can't find a  single 
one running for the ST.  4 are for IBM computers and one for  the 
Amiga.  Just in case you are interested what these releases are I 
will   mention  them  (for  the  IBM):   Star  Trek   (the   25th 
Anniversary),  The  Bard's  Tale Construction Kit,  Lord  of  the 
Rings  (Volume II,  the Two Towers),...  On the Amiga  they  have 
finally finished Deluxe Paint IV,  probably the best art  package 
ever coded. It is just amazing what it can do. If anybody is ever 
able  to  convert  it  correctly  to  the  ST  I  shall  be  well 
astonished. But I would still look forward to it. Electronic Arts 
have  also released a new game for the Sega Mega Drive  which  is 
called Starflight. 
     Electronic Arts have also announced their intention to  make 
a few of their titles low price ones.  These will then be sold at 
~œ10  (30DM).  Some of these titles were rather famous  in  their 
time  like  Populous,  Magic Fly or the  Immortal  (for  megabyte 
owners only).
     As  this company is one of the largest on the ST it  is  not 
too  strange that they are making more and more profit  over  the 
years.  


Delta Force:
------------
     This so famous group is expanding as you have probably  seen 
in the Interview column. They now have many more members and even 
a  female mascot.  Offbeat,  Thor and I are now members of  Delta 
Force.  At  this point I would like to explain why I am  also  in 
Delta Force. First of all, Lost Boys have not thrown me out, I am 
still  a Lust Boy.  But as it is quite hard to stay in touch  New 
Mode and Slime have asked me to join.  This is one of the reasons 
why Maggie is now being published under DF production.


Maggie:
-------
     I  would also like to announce that Maggie will  be  totally 
different from the next issue onwards.  It will have a 16  colour 
picture,  a  much nicer menu written in machine code by New  Mode 
and many more features.  This is just to keep it up to date  with 
other Disc Magazines like the one Galtan 6 are producing.  By the 
way, their disk magazine looks rather nice, so try to get hold of 
a copy.

     The Maggie Team has also been expanded now, herewith I would 
like  to  welcome a fellow programmer and article  writer  called 
Roman  Romanowski (always referred to as Kermit).  He  originated 
from Poland but is now living in Germany,   quite near to where I 
live. He will be doing to game reviewing etc. From the next issue 
onwards  all  the games reviewed in Maggie are given to us  by  a 
local Computer Shop called:   FUNNY SOFTWARE.  The owner of  this 
shop allows us to borrow the games and then review them,  we  are 
very  greatful  to  Oliver Heck for this.  His shop  also  has  a 
Mailorder,  so  in  case you are interested and want  games  very 
fast, write to this address:

                         Funny Software
                         Oliver Heck
                         Grazer Strasse 34
                         7000 Stuttgart-Feuerbach
                         Germany
                         or phone on:  0711 8568534  - 850325



     As in Maggie 7 (Which was shit) I would like to announce  my 
new address again.  For the PD library you also have to write  to 
my German address, so here it is:

                    Michael Schuessler
                    Seestrasse 34/2
                    7254 Hemmingen
                    WEST Germany
                    Tel.       49 - for Germany
                          (0)7150 - for Hemmingen
                             8447 - if you are in Hemmingen



Copy Partys:
------------
     I do not know if I should say this or not,  but it seems  as 
if there are quite a few coming up in the near future. I will not 
mention any group names,  but nice as I am,  I will tell you  the 
countries in which they are supposed to take place:  2 Partys  in 
Sweden,  1 Party in Holland, 1 Party in England and there was one 
just now in Germany.


     That's it with the news so far,

                    ta ta          Mike
