Here I am in the back room with Mandy (What's your ST called?). I have just
erased my little brothers pathetic soundtracker files and sent him to bed and
am now listening to my old Police tapes (Magic!). What shall I do? I know, I'll
do yet another game review (My 7th so far). What shall I review? I know, a pile
of crap called Kick Off 2:

                                  KICK OFF II
                        Anco           Reviewed by Tartiana

    It's not really that bad, it's just that I can't get the hang of it. I
bought the original Kick Off when it came out and thought "Wow! This is
brilliant!". Then I read all the reviews for Kick Off 2 and thought "Wow! That
must be more brilliant!". Then I bought it, shoved it in Mandy's drive (ooer!
(Now you know what Xtra RAM is for!)), turned her on (!) and thought "Wow! This
is a piece of shit!".
    Ideally it should be like Kick Off but with more options and features but
it seems to me that the oringinal's ease of control has been lost. In your
first game you are likely to see the oposition turn with the ball by just
touching it. If, however, you try to do this you will end up booting the ball
another 50 yards towards your goal. Another problem is the speed of the game,
It's too bloody fast.
    If you do get near the other goal you will also discover that the goalies
are ten times better than the originals. I will list the new features that
should make this a great game:

1)  1-4 players (with 4 player adaptor)
2)  Play in position (You are the same player all the time)
3)  4 Playing surfaces + 4 wind speeds (More variaty (Harder too!))
4)  Cup tournament (8 teams in a knockout competion)
5)  Set piece free kicks (Defensive walls and bendy shots (Bugger me if I can
do them though!))
6)  100's of unique players (They all look the same to me!)
7)  Team selection + Subtitutes (Take them off yourself before they're sent
off!)
8)  Load Player Manager teams + tactics (I don't have Player Manager)
9)  Save action replays and golden goals (But I haven't scored any!)
10) Choose your own ref (Screech every time, Yeah!)

(It is 10:43pm and I will finish this tommorow)
(It is now 10:11pm 23/7/91 (In other words it is tommorow))

11) Design your own kit (All Black!)
12) Reduce game speed to 50% or 25% (Boring!)

    My copy of Kick Off 2 also came with the World Cup extension so you and
your team (You have to be one of the 24 provided) can take part in the world
cup. The best my team (Scotland) has done is second in their group.
    The main options screen lets you choose several things like single games,
leagues, cups, kit design, edit replays, load extensions or the options screen.
The options screen lets you choose the difficulty level, the pitch, playing
conditions, match length and choosing your ref.
    The actual game is graphically and sonically very similar to Kick Off. The
gameplay, however, is totally different. For a start it is much faster with the
players wizzing around the field. The control system also seems different. In
the original holding down the button would make your player trap the ball, here
he kicks it as hard as he can. The goalies are much better and you can also
control the direction and strength of their kick outs. The throw-ins are also
controlable and you can take a long throw-in.
    This game sounds good in the reviews but personnaly I prefer the original
Kick Off.
