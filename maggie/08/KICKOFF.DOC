              Anco Software   Review by Tartiana

    I bought this game soon after I got my ST because most of the super pack
software was crap and there were no football games included with it. The game
comes in a flimsy box which falls apart in the post and so the disk ends up
outside the box. Once you boot the disk up (this took me quite some time as
Castle mail order sent me the Amiga version! (Arrggh Yeuck!)) you get a title
picture and a fairly poor quality sample.
    You are then presented with a scoreboard and the choice of Practice,
Practice penalties, Single game, League competition and the option of changing
the match length from 5 minutes each way to a full 45 minutes each way.
    The single game option allows you to choose one or two players and your
team formation. You are also told who the referee is. This is important as
there are 16 diferent referees ranging from ones who send a man off for every
foul to those who don't notice any of your fouls. Unfortunatle the ref is not
shown on the pitch so you can't hack him.
    The teams then line up on the picth and run off to their own halves of the
pitch. There is a scanner showing the positions of all the players and this can
be changed in size or turned off. The gameplay itself is fast (Unless you have
played Kick-off 2, Now that IS fast!) and the control system take a wee while
to get used to and you will find yourself commiting a lot of fouls. This is due
that the action of the fire button depends on whether you have possetion of the
ball or not. You control the player nearest to the ball (on your team) except
for your goalkepper who is always computer controlled. When you eventualy score
a goal the crowd cheers and your man runs off turning somersaults (unless you
scored an own goal!).
    In the league option there are eight different team which you can rename
and choose which one you are to play. The teams have their own characteristics
with the red team being fastest and the gray team the worst foulers. The season
lasts fourteen games after which you have to start again.
    The graphics are of a reasonable standard with the pitch being shown by an
overhead view. The sprites are tiny but this doesn't detract from gameplay and
means more of the pitch can be shown at once.
    The sound is all samples which are not to hot and consist of the refs
whistle, the ball hitting the post, the ball hiting the ground or a player and
the cheer of the crowd which can be turned off.
    This game is good but after a while you get good at it and winning the
league all the time gets boring. The two player option is good and a
multiplayer league even better!
