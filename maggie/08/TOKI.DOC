Perhaps  you think that this game is a worse game because  it  is 
from Ocean. But if you do so, you are utterly wrong!
 Just start the game and then you'll see the difference to other 
Ocean releases.  A good tune starts and the well-known Ocean-logo 
is  scrolled from the bottom to the top of the screen doing  some 
loops.  Finally  it stops at the top of the  screen.  After  this 
some  lines are moved under the logo which tells us  the  credits 
of the game as there are:

Programming: Jean-Charles Meyrignac (ST)
             Michel Janicki (Amiga)

Graphics: Philippe & Lionel Dessoly

Music & Sound FX: Pierre-Eric Loriaux

 Then there comes a little intro explaining why you are a monkey 
and why you are doing all those dangerous things.
  A  sorcerer  walks on the screen (which  now  is  smaller  than 
normal  but  that  isn't bad!) and a giant blue  hand  kidnaps  a 
beautiful  woman  with big tits and long  black  hair.  The  hand 
vanishs and the hero appears.  But the sorcerer casts a spell and 
the  man changes to a monkey.  After this animation  a  TOKI-logo 
wobbles in the screen.

O.k., let's press 'fire' to start the game...........

  First  of all you see a map on which you see  how  many  levels 
you've done and which one awaits you.  Not too good,  but you can 
live with it.

  After  pressing 'fire' again we finally start  with  the  first 
level.  My eyes see nice graphics and my ears hear good muzak. As 
I said some lines before the screen isn't as large as normal  but 
that is no problem for the game - NO!  It is just better that the 
screen  is  a bit smaller than normal otherwise  the  whole  game 
would  start  to jerk (because of too much VBL's) -  but  as  the 
screen  isn't  that big,  the game runs without  jerking  -  very 
impressive!
  The  joystick control is logical and you  won't  have  problems 
with it to guide 'your' TOKI through all six levels.
 Every level contains new graphics and some new enemies.  At  the 
end  of each level there is a big monster to kill.  You  have  to 
find his weak spot so that you can send it to hell.
 In all levels you will get extra weapons as there are:  a  'two-
sinus-shoot',  a  big shoot,  a  flamethrower,  a  'two-diagonal-
shoot',  and a helmet (most of the enemies can't kill  you).  You 
can also jump onto the monsters to kill them.
  The  screen  scrolls horizontal  and  vertical.  To  move  TOKI 
vertical  you have to use ropes and sometimes katapults (this  is 
a fucking good idea I think!).
 When you manage to finish the whole game (I'm sure it will  take 
you  some  long hours) then there will be no simple  'Game  Over' 
but  a  nice animation and some horrible faces (only  joking!)  - 
just look yourself!

  As  a  final resume I have to say that TOKI  is  a  game  worth 
buying.  It promises some funny hours (or days,  or months?)  for 
all  fans  of jump'n'run-games!  The playability is easy  in  the 
first  level  and you have to be a joystick acrobat  to  end  the 
last one (but it is NOT impossible!  Hi Furyo!).  Besides you can 
continue.
