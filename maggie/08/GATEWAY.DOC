                    -------------------------

                      by the AVENGERS (AVG)


               reviewed by New Mode of Delta Force


Just  for  your  information:  The  Avengers  are  a  new  French 
democrew.  They have been members of ULM (Unlimited Matricks) one 
year  ago and have been kicked out.  This is their first demo  on 
the  ST and in my opinion it's meant as a revenge.

Now let's begin with the review...


Introscreen:
------------
A  wobbling  logo  done  with the Tristar  font  seen  in  Cuddly 
mainmenu.  There's  a soundtracker music playing,  but it  sounds 
quite  usual,  not half as good as Chris' music in "Dark Side  of 
the Spoon".  At last there are some stars on an ugly logo  saying 
"Gateway to Hexenland".

Loadingscreen:
--------------
There are three big AVG sprites flying around. The wellknown font 
from  "Spherical"  is telling you some rather  unimportant  stuff 
like credits, etc.

Mainmenu:
---------
If you don't have this demo yet, just load your "Dark Side of the 
Spoon"  and you know this menu too.  It really  looks  completely 
ripped  and has quite ugly graphics compared to ULM's  menu.  You 
control a witch with your cursorkeys and have to go to  different 
doors to see the screens.  Usual soundchip music,  usual menu. By 
the way, it's a fullscreen.

Ying Yang:
----------
Nothing  oriental,  just  a very usual screen with  a  two-layer-
moving-background,  a disting scroller (one plane), some tracking 
sprites (one plane too) and music by ENS. Boring.

Clone:
------
Again a boring screen.  "Not ripped from Overlanders" that's what 
they write in the loader, but it looks like a certain OVR screen, 
that's what I think. Again the usual stuff you've already seen at 
least one million times (or less).  Sprites,  starfield,  disting 
logo,  and  the  best thing in this screen:  the  OVR  font  from 
"Delirous Demo II" (the big psygnosis lookalike, brilliant).

Prehistoric:
------------
They say it's old,  so I'll try to be as objective and fair as  I 
can be.  Again a screen you have seen one million times  already: 
this  time  it's a "conversion" from  TCB's  "Spreadpoint"  demo. 
There's  no  zooming logo,  no digisound,  and  no  DNA-scroller. 
There's just a disting logo and the usual scrollers.  Boring like 
hell!

Vector Ball:
------------
At  least  one  of the better screens  in  the  demo,  a  disting 
scroller, starfield and vectorball objects. Not very original but 
it looks nice.

Multitext:
----------
Vertical  moving  background,   vertical  scroller,   25  disting 
scrollers, and disting scrollers. Not bad.

Othello:
--------
They have included a game in their demo.  My first thoughts:  not 
bad!  The graphics and the soundtracker-music are crap,  but  the 
game is funny.

Once afar:
----------
This  is my favourite screen in the demo.  It features  some  big 
tracking  sprites (but the usual trick,  the first and  the  last 
shape never cross paths) and a very nice and big font. Nice.

Hidden screen:
--------------
Hidden  between two AVG-logos (there's a gap).  Just a  starfield 
and  some vector graphics.  See the "Mindbomb" hidden screen  for 
further details.

3D-anim:
--------
Filled  vector  graphics (not very fast) and some  ULM  slagging, 
nothing  more.  Pump  down the volume,  the music  is  shit  (but 
that's not really AVG's fault).

Pergadem:
---------
This one's a fullscreen with a vertical scrolling  background,  a 
text  going  up (Spaz' Megadeth font),  a  horizontal  one  plane 
scroller (too fast) and three little sprites.  It's not too  bad, 
really.

Madballs:
---------
Big  oneplane scroller,  tracking sprites (one plane) and a  text 
drawn with balls (nice idea).  There are also some vu-metres made 
out of something completely undefinable.

Fullswing:
----------
Again  a fullscreen.  There's a disting background made with  the 
simple   trick  everybody  should  know  by  now  (I  just   say: 
colourcycling). There's a disting AVG-logo and a ugly scroller.


Resetdemo:
----------
Once  again  many  little disting scrollers  and  a  big  disting 
oneplane-logo. There are no horizontal borders. Yawn!



General overview:

This  demo  isn't that bad really,  but there are almost  no  new 
ideas in it and originality is very important.  Most screens with 
ripped  ideas  in  it aren't half as good as  the  originals  and 
that's really poor!
The graphics are not very good (just some, and they are ripped).
And another thing I didn't like about this demo: in most screens, 
those guys are slagging off ULM and tell that they are bad coders 
and rippers.  I personally don't believe that because I know ULM, 
and  it  seems  obvious  that  it's  just  the  other  way  round 
(objective comment).

You  might think that I give too less points,  but in my  opinion 
the reviews in Maggie were too positive.  And see,  the rating is 
still a little more than average!
