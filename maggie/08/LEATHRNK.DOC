A review by Leon O'Reilly

     This  is  an old game that has recently been  re-released  at 
budget price. In its day it received quite good reviews.
     Leatherneck  is a standard vertically  scrolling  shoot-em-up 
which is very similar to Ikari warriors.  The main feature of this 
game is its four player option,  for this you will need a  special 
adaptor which Microdeal will be happy to sell you for the  bargain 
price  of œ5.95.  This adaptor can also be used for the  legendary 
Kick Off 2 (Though there are problems with player 3),  Gauntlet  2 
(It just isn't Gauntlet without four players!) and the forthcoming 
TV Sports basketball,  so an investment on this peripheral is  not 
too lavish - I've got one of the blighters and jolly useful it  is 
to. (And that last sentence definitely isn't a Double Etendre).
     The plot:
     You  are a rough tough eat-your-granny-for-breakfast type  of 
chap  who  is  only  happy when wallowing in  the  blood  of  your 
opposition's dismembered corpses. You are the kind of person who 
if you were driving along and saw someone knocked over you would 
drive over and make sure.
     One day you got out of the bed the wrong side and decided the 
world must pay for this atrocity.  You charge into the jungle and 
decide  all who stand in your way must die.  Besides,  you  think, 
that  last mince pie you ate tasted like horse dung wrapped up  in 
straw.  Well  you had wondered what a mince pie was doing it  that 
stable...
     You may have guessed that there is very little packaging with 
this game and thus no plot so I concocted my own one.  Not bad eh? 
as the Sunday Sport would say: 
     "Salesman's  amazing  pyschic  love  plums...clever  Trevor's 
alarming  eggbag saves his mummy...'My love plums can predict  the 
future'...Trevor  foresaw the Clapham junction rail  disaster  and 
Armenian earthquake during a scrote-strokin' session.". Quite.
     Back to the game.  Loading time is 47 seconds. Then you get a 
picture of a jungly background.  An Arnold Swatcheneggar type chap 
with muscles as big as mine appears on the screen.  He shoots five 
shots making nasty holes in my monitor!
     Pressing  fire takes you to the start of the game.  There  is 
water on which a boat type thingie moves up and lands on a  beach. 
Four tuff guys get off (That's you!)(No not all of them!). You 
have to move your joystick otherwise the computer thinks you 
aren't playing and kills you.
     The  actual play area is small,  about half the width of  the 
screen.  The scrolling is very smooth and the big tanks and  boats 
that bring you onto levels also move very smoothly.
     The  Leatherneck sprites you control are quite well  defined. 
The  'evil  villagers' have very small sprites  which  are  poorly 
animated.
     To the right of the playing area is the status panel  showing 
each players' score,  number of lives left,  remaining  ammunition 
(Depicted by a bullet) and current weapon.
     You can change the weapon you are holding by either  waggling 
the  joystick  left and right or pressing a specific  key  on  the 
keyboard.
     The waggling is similar to when selecting an icon on  Wizball 
but more temperamental.  You waggle furiously trying to swap weapon 
and nothing happens so you eventually give up, find the key on the 
keyboard and press it.  You look up and find you've been shot.  On 
the  next  life you select the correct weapon while  you're  still 
invulnerable.  You  move your way up to the mortar press  fire  to 
throw a grenade and realise your gyrating movement has caused  the 
weapon  to change and you are now holding a puny  gun.  The  tears 
begin to stream down your face as the mortar pile into your  body. 
You rip the disk out of the drive,  run down to the christmas tree 
and wire the disk up to the lights.  You smile with  satisfaction 
as you flick the switch and the disk and lights explode.  Your joy 
turns to dismay as your house burns down.
     Playing  the  game  solo is very hard  as  there  are  enough 
enemies  to  waste  four  players.   Playing  multi-player  is  an 
experience.  You  can shoot your friends in the back killing  them 
and gaining valueable points.  Be warned: Play this game with your 
best  friend or girlfriend and you may never speak to  each  other 
again.
     "You shot me then!"
     "Did not!"
     "Well the screen was empty, I was standing in front of you an 
I mysteriously died. Explain that!"
     "You trod on a particularly sharp stone"
     "A sharp stone?"
     "Yes."
     "And just how sharp was this stone?
     "About 20MPH"
     "A stone can't be 20 Miles per hour sharp!"
     "Well this one was"
     "Listen  you  slug-faced  fossil  brained  dollop  of   Amiga 
excretion, you shot me"
     "Why would I shoot you?"
     "To get that ammo I was about to collect!"
     "I never saw it!"
     "You lying scum! You made a direct line for it shooting 
everything in your path, including me!"
     "How dare you insinuate that!! That's slander! You'll hear 
from my solicitors in the morning!"
     <Door slams and several years of legal proceding follow. The 
verdict: guilty. The punishment: playtester for Ocean games - the 
worst torture known to mankind!.>
     
     In summary: Yes.

     This is really a standard shoot-em-up from Steve 'horizontal 
scrolling is impossible in a game on the ST' Bak with small 
sprites and some OK samples and music good enough for the 
Whattaheck demo (as featured on the annoying loading screen which 
you can't bypass!). Playing it alone is too much fun, but invite a 
few friends over, have a few pints then start playing this and 
prepare for a massive fight! Great fun!
     If you haven't any friends to play the game with, here are 
some handy tips on getting loads of mates:
1) Make a printing press and start printing œ20 notes and 
distributing them about for free.
2) Stop being a trainspotter.
3) Write, produce and sing on a record that tops the charts in 42 
different countries.
4) Write soundchip music on the ST that surpasses Jochen Hippel's 
standards.
5) Bomb Commodore UK's headquarters.
6) Stop wearing those purple flares and platform shoes
7) Assassinate the cast of neighbours.
8) Buy a pub and have 6 'free drinks nights' a week.
9) Buy a pub and have 7 'free drinks nights' a week.
10) If the above don't work, you know there is something seriously 
wrong with you. Go and live on a obscure pacific islands and count 
sand grains. Good luck.
