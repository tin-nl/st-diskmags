                             ~~~~~~~
By Leon O'Reilly

     Atari  are  going  to be extremely busy over  the  next  few 
years and I don't think it is going to far to say that they  will 
be   regarded  as  the  most  consistently  innovative   hardware 
producer of the 1990s.
     There  are a whole variety of new machines to  be  released, 
not  of all them are ST compatible,  but all of them  are  highly 
interesting.

                             LYNX II
     After the tremendous success Atari has enjoyed with its Lynx 
console,  they  have decided to release a new improved model  and 
capture  more of the portable console market.  The original  Lynx 
wiped the floor with the game boy, it had 4096 colours, 4 channel 
sound controlled by a 32-Bit audio processor,  hardware scroller, 
hardware sprites,  sprite scaling - in short everything the  STFM 
should've had but didn't.  The Lynx did have one shortcoming,  it 
wasn't  truly portable unless you had pockets the size  of  Cyril 
Smith.  Now Atari have rectified this problem by designing a more 
compact   version   of  the  Lynx  which   is   truly   handheld. 
Unfortunately,  unlike  the original Lynx,  it can't double as  a 
canoe in 'sticky' situations. 
     There are rumours of a new technically advanced Lynx, though 
I don't know when, where or if it will be released, or what these 
enhanced specifications are. One to look out for though.

                             JAGUAR
     Atari  go console crazy!  Atari have disbanded  their  other 
planned  consoles  (the panther,  the leopard,  the tiger  &  the 
tiddles) and are going to go ahead with a Neo-Geo like 'Arcade in 
your home' console.  Whereas the panther was to be a 16-Bit super 
console which would be a step above the Sega  Megadrive,  Atari's 
new machine will be a 62-Bit wondermachine using RISC technology. 
It  will stun everyone.  Details are sketchy as yet,  but  you'll 
need sunglasses to look at this god-like console!

                             ST BOOK
     Goodbye STACY,  you weren't quite good enough for Atari (but 
apparently  the VCS console is!!).  The STACY was big and  bulky, 
the  trackball  was awkward as it trapped your  fingers  and  the 
batteries life was about as long the list of good US Gold  games. 
So your all new caring,  sharing Atari have remixed the Stacy and 
released the all new 12-Inch mix. Well actually it measures 297mm 
by  210mm  and is 35mm thick.  The battery life of  the  book  is 
estimated  as 5-10 hours.  Think of all the games of Kick Off  2 
you could have! (If a mono version was made that is!).
     The  ST book comes complete with a 1 or 4 meg memory  enough 
for  all professional packages to work - that's up  to  4,194,304 
bytes  to play around with.  The LCD screen resolution is 640  by 
400,  that's 256,000 pixels to mess with. It also has an internal 
20 megabyte hard drive,  that's...oh forget it.  This hard  drive 
measures  a 'tiny' two and a half inches.  60 and  100  megabytes 
hard drives are promised by the end of the year. 
     Also  on this little gem of a machine is 120  pin  expansion 
bus  and  the  capability of an internal fax  with  varying  baud 
rates.  There will also be some utilities (presumably built  into 
ROM) which include a diary, an 'alarm clock' and a calendar.
     In  place  of the STACY's trackball Atari have  installed  a 
'mouse-pad'  which  is  best described as  a  pressure  sensitive 
mouse.  Instead of using conventional floppy disks,  the ST  Book 
will  use  'memory cards' each providing 4 megabytes  of  storage 
space and boasting a fast access time. The only problem with this 
is  that  it  reduces  the  Book's  compatibility  with  the  ST, 
transferring data will become a problem - a nightmare of wires at 
least.  Still this is very compact and sexy machine and should do 
a lot better than the STacy.

                             ST PAD
     Not  a  press-on-towel,  but  a  spanking  new  ST  with  an 
uninhibited  user  interface.  Those  of you  who  can't  tell  a 
keyboard from a keyring will be pleased to know that there is now 
keyboard on this machine,  it simply has a light pen like  device 
attached to it. At first glance this machine resembles an Etch-a-
Sketch but without the twiddly knobs and the grey sand. You input 
directly  with the pen - instead of typing letters you can  train 
the  pad  to recognise your handwriting and you can write  it  in 
longhand  and it will convert it to ASCII.  You can  even  create 
your own shorthand!  Drawing will become a lot easier,  give  any 
artist a choice between a pen and a mouse and he/she'll say  "yes 
but  I'm not dead so it won't be worth anything".   The Pad  uses 
STE   hardware   to  produce  smooth  hardware   scrolling   when 
necessary. The medium res bug shouldn't be a problem...
     The  ST  Pad may seem a bit gimmicky at first  but  you  can 
guarantee  it  will  sell  like hot cakes in  America  and  is  so 
innovative that it will appeal to a wider audience than just  the 
regular  computer consumers.  I think this machine  could  really 
take off for Atari.  

                             FALCON
     Pricey, but juicy. This is a TT with a unix operating system 
and  a  CD-I drive.  It will probably cost about œ2000  and  will 
appeal  to  business  users and lucky  gits  who've  won  massive 
cheques  from Littlewoods.  If anyone gets one of these  machines 
and doesn't like it,  I'd be happy to take it off their hands for 
a nominal fee!

                              STPC
     This  is  one in a line of phenomenal machines  which  Atari 
have  recently  announced.  I  don't know that  much  about  this 
machine, but it will be fully compatible with both the ST and the 
PC.  I  assume  it will have some form of  modified  hardware  PC 
emulator  built  in and the actual computer will be built  on  ST 
technology  rather than it being a PC with an ST emulator  built. 
One exciting feature of this computer is that it will have a 1.44 
megabyte drive!

     With  the  release  of  these  new  machines,  Atari  has  a 
formidable  range of computers capable of taking on  and  beating 
the other members of their respective genre. The Lynx is the best 
handheld,  and there is to be an enhanced version out  soon.  The 
Jaguar  has better specifications than the Neo-Geo yet its  price 
competes  with  the  Sega  megadrive.   In  terms  of  power  and 
compatibility the Falcon blows away the CDTV.  The STPC gives the 
ST  all  the business power it needs and combines this  with  the 
wealth  of  MIDI and DTP software available to the  ST  making  a 
computer  twice as good as a PC and able to hold its own  against 
the Mac with a bigger screen size and a faster processor.  The ST 
pad  has a market all of its own,  and as it so unique,  I  think 
this market will be very large.
     Atari  are building a reputation for  consistently  creating 
new and innovative computers, and this new line up just shows how 
hard their developers have been working.  Atari have now a  range 
of  computers  to tackle the  home,  business  and  entertainment 
market  whilst  they dominate the music market.  Atari  have  the 
power   in   the  hands  to  become  the  number   one   computer 
manufacturers in the world. This time, let's hope they don't mess 
it up.
