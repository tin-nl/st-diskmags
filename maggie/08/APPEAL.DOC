   (If you can't read the logo, you're either blind or you haven't half shut 
                        your eyes when looking at it.)


     THIS IS AN APPEAL TO ALL THE GREAT DEMO CREWS AND CODERS OUT THERE!!

  AS YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY GUESSED, THE ABOVE LOGO IS THE NAME OF SOMETHING..
  TO BE PRECISE, IT IS THE NAME OF A NEW DEMO THAT TOUR DE FORCE ARE WORKING
  ON...  WE WANT TO TRY AND MAKE THIS THE BIGGEST DEMO EVER MADE ON AN ATARI
   ST, BUT IF WE ARE TO DO THIS, WE NEED YOUR HELP!! EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT AN
   ESTABLISHED CREW, WE WILL ACCEPT YOUR SCREENS  (I WOULDN'T CALL T-deF AN
   ESTABLISHED CREW, WOULD YOU?)  WE HOPE TO RELEASE THE VISUAL MIRAGE DEMO
  SOMETIME IN 1992, BUT IT PROBABLY WON'T BE READY BY THEN, SO I'LL SAY 1993

  "YYYYAAAAAARRRGGGGHHHH!!", I HEAR YOU SCREAM, "1993?!?!". "YUP", COMES THE
   REPLY. WE WILL (OF COURSE) BE WRITING A FEW (WELL, A LOT OF) SCREENS FOR
   THE DEMO, BUT THIS ISN'T VERY LIKELY TO MAKE IT THE BIGGEST DEMO AROUND
  IS IT?  THAT'S WHERE YOU (YES, YOU) COME IN....  WRITE SOME NICE SCREENS!!
  TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS (DO YOU HAVE FRIENDS?)  GET THEM TO WRITE SCREENS AS
      WELL!! IT'S SIMPLE REALLY!!  WE HAVE A VERY ORIGINAL MENU IDEA, SO 
    ORIGINAL IN FACT, THAT IT WILL TAKE UP MOST OF THE PROGRAMMING TIME!!!

                  OTHER STUFF TO THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS.......
