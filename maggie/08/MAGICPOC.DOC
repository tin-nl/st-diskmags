
  MAGIC POCKETS BY THE BITMAP BROTHERS, BY RENEGADE
                         Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     This  game  was borrowed from Funny Software  in  Stuttgart, 
yeah, it's these guys whose advert is in this Maggie. Their games 
are  cheaper than anywhere else and the delivery is  also  rather 
fast.  As you have probably gathered, they also do mail order !!! 
Why don't you write off to them to obtain their list,  it is well 
worth it.

     This  game is another marvellous product by the  authors  of 
Gods,  Xenon  I and II with musix by Betto Boo at  the  beginning 
(the music is well done).

Aim of the game:
You  are the Bitmap Kid.  One night you appear to have  lost  all 
your toys. When you then search your pockets you find a big hole, 
a BLACK hole. Examining this hole you dissapear in it and shrink. 
You  then  recognize that you are in your pocket.  You  must  now 
wonder  around in your pocket in order to retrieve all your  lost 
toys.  This  is no easy task as you are continually  attacked  by 
various monsters.  Always when you get closer to an exit you find 
some of your toys, take 'em and run for your life. 

     Alltogether there are 4 corners of Pocketland.  Each corner, 
or should I rather say level becomes harder and  harder.  There's 
one  particular type of Pocketland person who will always try  to 
get to the toy before you do,  so watch out. If you do not manage 
to get to the toy first, do not worry, you can still go on to the 
next level, you get extra point if you have your toy with you. 

     You should never hang around the exit for too long because a 
bubble  will catch up with you and it won't be  too  healty,  you 
will loose most of your power if you do not manage to distroy the 
bubble fast enough. 

     There  are  a few ways through which you  can  obtain  Bonus 
points. There are a few sweets hanging about, or you can trap the 
monsters.  After having trapped a monster they will disappear and 
a sweet will stay. Another way to gain extra points is by kicking 
the pile of coins and then collecting them.  

     The various monsters around need to be hit once or others  a 
few times.  If some are only hit once they are stunned,  if  they 
are hit twice or sometimes more they will die and disappear.  You 
have  to  watch out because some of the monsters try to  get  the 
sweets before you.   if you kill one of these monsters they  will 
leave a Power up behind.  

     Finding  the exit is very easy.  Always when you shoot at  a 
monster,  an  arrow  appears  and  points  in  the  corresponding 
direction.          

     There are a few secret bonuses hidden in the game, sometimes 
you can even warp to the beginning of the next level.  Mean as  I 
am,  I will not tell you how to get to them.  There are sometimes 
features like standing behind a TV, if you pull down the joystick 
you can tell where you have to go next.  In order to fly you have 
to blow bubbles by pulling back the joystick.  If you are  caught 
in  a cave,  try stepping into your "bullet" (you will be  thrown 
upwards).

     A  good joystick with long lasting buttons is essential  for 
this  game,  believe me,  I have already wrecked one playing  the 
game non stop.
