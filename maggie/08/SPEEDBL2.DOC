        Bitmap Brothers/Mirrorsoft    Review by Tartiana

    This game is addictive, has great graphics and sound, good gameplay and is
a highly polished game - everything we have come to expect from the Bitmap
Brothers. The backround for the game is that the game of Speedball has been run
underground by corruption and has deteriated into a fiasco. Now the game has
been reorganised with new teams, rules and leagues. You are to take charge of
the newest team - Brutal Deluxe - who at first aren't very brutal but with your
skills as a manager and a player will soon hopefully be top of the first
division and win the championship. I say soon because you have a maximum of two
seasons to do it in. If you are not promoted from the second division in the
first season your game ends there.
    Upon loading you are presented with the title screen and backround
information about the game is shown on the screen. The music (by Nation 12) is
identical to the Amiga version.
    The game options are to play a league as player/manager or just manager
(where you can fast forward the game to save time), play in the cup, the
knockout competion, play a two player game or watch a demo game.
    Your team at first is a bunch of hopless partimers who look like they
should be driving busses or sitting at a desk. You can change your team by
taking them to the gym to buy equipment or by trading them in for star-players.
They cost a lot but the difference is noticable.
    The game itself is three minutes (two halves of ninety seconds) of pure
violence. The pitch is large and the players are big and well animated so you
can even see them hitting each other. There are four ways to score points:
goals (10 points) hitting one of the two bounce domes (2 points) hitting the
stars on the side of the pitch (2 points each, 10 if you hit them all) and
getting a player from the other team stretchered off (10 points). There are
other goodies on the side of the pitch such as the score multiplyer, a ball
electrifier and warp gates. Bonuses and coins appear on the pitch and these can
be picked up. After the game you can spend your money and patch up your team.
    The graphics are excellent with bold metallic colours and large sprites.
The scrolling is smooth and keeps up with the action except when the ball is
teleported from one end of the pitch to the other.
    Sound is all samples (except the cheer of the crowd (which is pathetic if
you have played the Amiga version)) and adds to the game.
    This game is simply brilliant and full of action and is possibly the best
two player game ever. The one disadvantage is that saving your game on a disk
totaly knackers the disk beyond repair (God knows why).
