     Otherwise known as: Bilbo & Stick's big German adventure!

Introduction:

     Some months ago Bilbo received our invite for Delta  Force's 
second International Coding Conference.  At that time we  weren't 
sure whether we would be going or not, but we did WANT to go.
     It  was decided that,  yes,  we would definately  go.  So  I 
(Stick) being the sort of responsible and organised person that I 
started making arrangements for the both of us.
     We originally wanted to drive to Stuttgart,  as we  presumed 
that this was the cheapest way to get here.  As it turned out  we 
managed  to  secure  some return air tickets for  less  than  the 
equivalent price of driving there.  ( œ130 each, return ).
     
     Okay, introduction over....


Wednesday 31st July 1991. ( The day before the ICC#2 ).

     We set off on our merry way from Bilbo's house at about 11am
on   the  M1  motorway  towards  bright  and  breezy   Birmingham 
International  Airport.  Our  flight was not due to  leave  until 
4:35pm so we had plenty of time to get there,  as it's only about 
120 miles ( 200km ) to the airport from Leeds.  We'd deliberately 
set  off early as due to the state of Britains  crumbling  'road' 
system  there  are so many roadworks and delays  that  a  journey 
which should take 2 hours can often end up being doubled!
     We arrived at the airport with over 3 hours to spare, so  we 
spent our time eating,  drinking and chatting. When we eventually 
came  to board the plane we had to stop all our disks from  being 
X-rayed  in customs.  ( And trying to explain why we didn't  want 
them X-raying!)
     Bilbo and myself had never flown before, so it was all a new 
'experience' for us.  Once on the plane the journey passed rather 
uneventfully.  ( I must say that the plane,  a Boeing B111 ( ?  ) 
was  more like a well used and abused flying bus.  Not built  for 
comfort and definately on the spartan side of uncomfortable! )
     After our one and a half hour flight we landed at  Stuttgart 
airport.  Bilbo was straight through customs, but as usual, I had 
to have all my documents checked etc.....      
     There to meet us were Newmode and Slime of Delta Force. They 
took  us by car to Chaos Inc's house,  as we were  staying  there 
that evening.  ( As of course,  the conference itself was not  to 
start until the next day ).
     After a brief introduction we all went out to a local  Pizza 
restaurant  for  some PIZZA !  ( The pizzas in Germany  are  even 
cheaper than at home in England ! ).
     The rest of the evening was spent sat out on the balcony  of 
Chaos  Inc's  house,  while drinking some excellent  local  beer. 
Chaos  spent some considerable time trying to convince us why  we 
should stop using Degas Elite and use Neochrome Master instead.
     
Thursday 1st August 1991 ( The first day of the ICC#2 ).

     The first day of the ICC#2 found us getting up early,  as we 
had  to get to the hall where the event was to take place  before 
9am,  which  was  the  official  time  that  people  could  start 
arriving.  The  fun part was that Chaos Inc was driving us  there 
and he didn't know exactly where the hall was, except that it was 
in Leutenbach ! We eventually found it and along with the rest of 
Delta  Force we set about the task of laying out all  the  tables 
and  chairs around the place.  The first arrival of the  day  was 
Sammy  Joe  of TLB at around 11am.  Next to arrive  were  various 
members  of  the  French group,  Mystic  at  around  1pm.  People 
trickled in throughout the afternoon, but there was a huge influx 
at around 5pm !!
     By the late evening there were,  according to Slime's rather 
rough and ready guest arrival list,  some 79 people had turned up 
out of the invited 105.
     
     Groups arriving on the first day ( or members from them ):

     Delta Force (of course!),  The Lost Boys,  The  Overlanders, 
ULM,  ACF,  Offbeat,  Legacy,  Next,  TCB,  NPG, TEX (and most of 
Thalion software),  Electra,  ST-Connexion,  TVI,  Naos, Masters, 
BMT,  SOTE,  Firehawks, Richard Karsmakers and Stefan Postuma. Oh 
and of course, I nearly forgot, Ripped-Off !
     And lots of other individuals,  but I cannot figure out  all 
of the groups from Slimes list.  So I apologise to any group that 
attended that is not mentioned above.
     
     This first evening was quite chaotic, with lots of noise and 
music etc....
     Some of the stuff to be seen in the first evening:
 
     It  appeared  that  nearly all  the  attending  groups  were 
putting  forward at least one screen for the ICC#2 demo which  is 
entitled:  'Punish your Machine'.  I was told that Electra wanted 
to enter 5 screens!  So it would appear that the demo would  have 
to  be  extended  to two disks or Delta Force would  have  to  be 
pretty  picky  at selecting the best  screens.  Most  groups  had 
brought completed screens with them,  or were finishing them  off 
while  here.  And  I can tell you there were  some  really  great 
screens being knocked up.
     Mad  Max was there of course,  with large crowds around  him 
whenever he sat in front of his music editor. Eric Simon ( of Tex 
and Thalion ) was also here,  showing off a new 3D filled  vector 
game called:  Trex Warrior,  which looks superb! He also had some 
demos of a texture mapping routine which looked quite amazing and 
also fast considering what he was making the ST do!
     Also  we  saw a preview of the new Lost Boys demo  which  is 
entitled: Cor What a Scorcher! The main menu is rather innovative 
and  very nice,  I won't say much 'cos it'll spoil the  surprise. 
All I can say is that it looks as if this is going to be the demo 
to beat all demos!  ( Until the next amazing megademo comes along 
that is !  ) Manikin reckons it should be released bfore the  end 
of August...
     Being  worked upon also was the Transbeaunce 2 ( disk  1  ), 
all  the screens being ready,  but with quite a few bugs  in  the 
main menu to be ironed out.  This testing for bugs was being done 
by  Krazy  Rex of St Connexion,  ( who also did the  (very  nice) 
graphics  for the demo ). The screens from this demo that we  saw 
were  also of a VERY high standard and it was hoped that all  the 
bugs would be ironed out before the end of the conferenece.
     Richard  Karsmakers  was doing what he called 'A  real  time 
article  on the ICC#2'.  Meaning that he left his ST on  all  the 
time and anybody who wanted to could type some text,  so that  by 
the  end  of  the conference he would have a  very  large  (  and 
unusual ! ) record of the preceedings.
     By  about 8pm Bilbo & myself were feeling quite  hungry  and 
decided  that we would take a wander into Winnenden to check  out 
the availablity of food. ( It must be pointed out that there were 
crates of Coca-Cola,  Fanta, Sprite and mineral water, along with 
stacks of crisps and pretzels which had all been laid on by Delta 
Force.  But  I  suppose that everybody had to get  something  for 
their  40dM ( about œ13 ) enterance fee ).  The hall  itself  was 
about 2000 dM to hire, I beleive !
     We  found  a pizza place in Winnenden and  promptly  ordered 
what we wanted.( Along with some lovely German beer,of course! ).
While we were there Tex ( Mad Max,  Eric Simon,  Udo etc ) sat at 
the table accross from us.  Gradually the place filled with other 
people from the convention,  it seemed that everybody was  homing 
in  on this particular pizza parlour.  ( Probably because it  was 
the first one you came to in the town! )
     While  we were in there Questlord of Delta Force  joined  us 
and  during the course of eating we talked about all  the  things 
that  people do when neither of the parties concerned  can  speak 
the  language  of  the other.  ( If only  they  spoke  French  in 
Germany!  )  Mind  you,  everybody here had to speak  in  English 
because of course it's the language that just about all Europeans 
can speak besides their native tongue....
     Meeting Questlord in the pizza parlour proved to a bit of  a 
shit  as he decided to walk back to the conference with  us,  but 
insisted on showing us another way back........
     What  should have been a fifteen minute walk turned into  an 
hour of 'I think this is the wrong way, let's go this way'....
It wouldn't have been so bad but it was raining......
     Eventually  we  decided it would be a good idea to  use  the 
local  map which Slime had issued to us and as a result  we  soon 
arrived  back at base.  ( The map was definately one  of  Slime's 
better ideas for the conference! )
     It  was around midnight when we arrived back and  the  place 
was  REALLY  heaving.  All  types of  music  blasting  out,  keys 
clicking,  Mad Max and Chris of ULM playing some stuff on a midi-
cd-amp-mixer-mini-studio  setup  and  all  the  general  clowning 
around that you would expect at this type of meeting.
     Eventually I decided I had to get some sleep, I was SO tired 
and  guess what?  I still had to blow up my bloody  airbed!  Just 
what I needed!  Eventually,  the bed was inflated, I was snuggled 
up  in  my sleeping bag,  Bliss!  Well it would have been  if  it 
hadn't have been for the pissing row of the forty or so ST's  all 
belching out their own form of ear torturing noise.  'Please make 
them stop, I want to sleep!' is all I could think.......
     I awoke at around 3:30am,  busting for a slash,  I went down 
through the hall where at least half of the attending crowd  were 
still at it! ( oooer! ).          
     After  my quick visit to the toilet I decided to  type  some 
more text into Richard's ST. Some of the shit and drivel that had 
been typed in during the day was unbelievable,  but made for  fun 
reading!  Crawling back into my bed ( !!? ) I slowly fell  asleep 
again,  with  the sound of Bilbo's snoring almost drowned out  by 
the  noise  of the congregation below.  ( It's also a  bit  of  a 
bastard when some T**t keeps walking on you so he can get past ).
They  were  French  guys and I  eventually  shouted  some  French 
insults at them and I think they got the message.....


Friday 2nd August 1991. ( The second day of the ICC#2 ).

Groups (or members of) arriving on this day:
     Respect, Light.

7:30am....
     I  was  awoken  by  the rather  loud  music  eminating  from 
somebodies ST.  Shit! I didn't want to sleep anyway! So I decided 
to  go and wash my face & brush my teeth.  ( I REALLY would  have 
liked  to have a shower,  but the hall only had 4 (  stinking!  ) 
toilets and two wash basins ).
     On my way to the toilets I came accross Sammy Joe was asleep 
in the middle of the floor of the hall,  blood streaming from his 
mouth and broken teeth were scattered around him.......
     Pinned to his sleeping bag was a sign, which read:
     'Please kick me. Preferably with both feet or a bat!'
     Bilbo  was still fast asleep so I decided to take  a  stroll 
down to the local bakers shop where I bought some bread etc...
     The  morning passed in a rather un-eventful way.  In fact  I 
can safely say that we were quite bored.  Nothing much seemed  to 
be happening......
     Around 2pm Bilbo, myself, Richard Karsmakers and Spaz of TLB 
went to the local pub where we managed to successfully order some 
food.  We all had a rather nice mushroom omlette with salad. Spaz 
was bored. 'I want a piss orgy!' he kept shouting.
     When  we  arrived back at the hall quite a few  people  were 
playing Midi-Maze. I decided to go and have a sleep as I was VERY 
tired.
     When I awoke at about 5 pm I saw that Bilbo was also asleep.
Downstairs  there was a lot of activity,  the Midi Maze game  was 
being played on 16 machines! Slime announced that we would have a 
Midi Maze tournament.  We were split into groups of 8 or nine and 
allowed about five minutes in which to have a practice game.
     Needless to say I got no further than the preliminary  round 
in which Slime kicked my arse!
     While the other preliminary rounds were taking place I  took 
the opportunity to go and speak with some people.
     Also,  by  now the smell from the toilets ( which could  not 
cope with the continuous stream ( no pun intended!  ) of users  ) 
was slowly working it's way out into the hall.  A sign was on the 
main  door  to them which read 'Keep this  door  shut.  The  urin 
(actual spelling!) stinks so bad!'  Need I say more?
     Later in the evening Bilbo, Vantage, Krazy Rex, myself and a 
few  other guys went into the local town and visited yet  another 
pizzeria. Fortunately for us, Vantage can speak some German so he 
translated the menu for us.  I had an excellent lesagne and Bilbo 
had eine pizza mit thunfische, krabben und knoblausch. (His third 
seafood pizza of the conference!) The meal was really nice, but I 
must say that the beer was crap!  So the hero of the evening  was 
good old (young) Vantage, without his help we would have probably 
starved.
     Upon  our  return  to the conference  the  Midi  Maze  final 
between Udo, Blagger, Fabian, Mad Max and Leonardo had just ended 
with  Udo winning by a very small margin.  He was then  presented 
with some kind of mega-fuck-off joystick as the prize.
     The  time had now arrived for some serious drinking to  take 
place  within  the  Ripped-Off camp.  We  opened  the  bottle  of 
Southern  Comfort which Bilbo had bought earlier in the  day  and 
started drinking.. ( Note: We were drinking outside as one of the 
(few) rules of the conference was that no alcohol was to be drunk 
inside the building ). Things started to get very silly from this 
point onwards.......


Saturday 3rd of August 1991 ( The third day of the ICC #2)

Groups (or people from them) arriving on this day:
     Sewer Software, ENS, Galtan Six.

     We  basically  spent until 4:30am drinking and  chatting  to 
anybody  that could understand our ( exceedingly slurred by  this 
time   !   )  Yorkshire  accents.   One  of  the  more   noteable 
conversations  being  with Manikin of TLB ( Mainly 'cos  we  were 
still sober(ish) and he is English! )
     I'd been typing bits of text on Richard's (Karmakers) ST for 
his  'realtime article' at various times of the day,  but I  must 
admit  to  almost  kidknapping  the  keyboard  at  about  3:30am. 
Understandably I was running in automatic 'I don't know what  the 
fuck  I'm writing' mode at this point.  I read later some of  the 
stuff I'd written and it was all garbage! ( But humourous garbage 
nevertheless ).
     Not many people were actually awake at this late hour. There
were people sleeping under the tables etc...
     Bilbo  had  taken  over typing and was going at  it  like  a 
demented zombie speed typist when I decided I ought to stumble up 
to my (air)bed while I was still capable.  What did I find when I 
got there?  Well firstly, my bed had been moved some considerable 
distance  by  other people who had decided that  they  wanted  to 
sleep  in the same area.  Ok,  so that's not a big problem for  a 
mild mannered person like myself.  But what's this?  Yes, there's 
some bastard in my bed!!  No,  not on it, but actually inside the 
sleeping  bag!!  I  gave the guy a swift kick and  muttered  some 
swear words at him. He soon moved. Of all the bloody cheek !
     I  awoke at 9:30am after having slept continuously from  the 
time my head had hit the (pre-warmed) pillow. I turned to Bilbo's 
bed to see if he was still asleep. Oh fuck! What's this? Only the 
same  guy who had invaded my bed actually fast asleep in  Bilbo's 
bed!
     I  don't know who the guy was,(he was French) but I do  know 
one thing, he's the cheekiest twat I've ever come accross....
     So  where was my other half Mr O'Blib ?  A quick look  about 
discovered him downstairs having a drink, he'd not been to bed at 
all.  Yes,  he'd been awake all night having lotsa fun and stuff! 
When  I met him he didn't look as if he'd not had any  sleep,  in 
fact he looked quite good for an ugly git!
     Bilbo told me the tale of what had happened when the members 
of Galtan six turned up.....
     It was apparently about 6am when they arrived and of  course 
almost everybody was asleep.( For the first time in this event! )
They  wanted  to know were somebody ( I've forgotten who  )  was. 
When  Bilbo pointed the guy out and remarked that they should  be 
quiet because he was sleeping,  they went over and woke the  poor 
guy  up !  They wanted to know why he wasn't awake and  ready  to 
greet them on their arrival.....
     Lots  of  people had been mentioning to me how drunk  I  was 
on the previous night, apparently I was laughing a lot and like a 
hyena...
     Bilbo  and I had some breakfast and then went out  into  the 
glorious sunshine and played some table tennis, well we tried to!
     The  playground outside the hall had been comandeered  early 
in the morning by some German firemen, it appeared that they were 
going to hold a childrens fete.
     At around 11:30am we went to the local outside swimming pool 
complex with Furyo and Mr Bee of the Overlanders. It was a really 
nice  place.  There was an indoor childrens pool.  All the  other 
pools were outside.  A diving pool with a high board which  Furyo 
took great delight in doing 'bombs' from.  An full sized  olympic 
type proper swimming pool, but best of all was the 'fun' pool. It 
had all sorts of great stuff in it.  It had a water  slide,  some 
sort of built in chair thingies which you sat in and they were  a 
bit  like a jacuzzi.  Some fountains,  a waterfall  thingy,  some 
jobbies  which  bubbled the water up in the middle of  the  pool. 
Best of all there was a section which ran around the edge of  the 
(circular)  pool and had underwater nozzles which blew the  water 
out.  The  result being you couldn't stand up and got blown  down 
the length of the pool.  Fabbo or what! 
     The  main  reason for going to this lovely  outdoor  aquatic 
centre was primarily so we could have that luxury of luxuries,  a 
shower.  But  we  thought  that  we may as  well  get  our  2dM's 
(65pence!)   worth   and  act  like  a  set  of  kids   that   we 
are.....  With Furyo driving and Mr Bee as the map reader we  did 
get quite lost on the way back to the hall......
     A  little while after returning,  Bilbo decided to get  some 
sleep as he had been nodding off in the car on the way back  from 
the pool. It was great to be clean again !!    
     By the middle of the afternoon some people had already  left 
the conferenece to go home. ( Ha! Bloody wimps! )
     Til Breubeck had just finished coding the follow up to Rings 
of Medusa that day.  ( Entitled 'Return to Medusa' I think!  ) We 
spent  some  considerable time chatting about the game  with  him 
showing me all of it's features etc... I didn't play the game but 
it  has the look and feel of a great game.  It has  the  original 
games music in it, only remixed. (Very effectively I must add.. ) 
This game deserves to do well ! Good luck Til !
     I  wasted the rest of the afternoon away by sitting  outside 
in the glorious sunshine, just drinking and drinking.
     At  7pm Ripped-Off Demo CD's took their daily visit  to  the 
pizzeria  !  I  had  lasagne again (my secound  time  during  the 
conference) and Bilbo had....... his fourth pizza mit Thunfische, 
krabben unt knoblouch (seafood).  Washed down with the obligatory 
couple of Sanwald beers.
     Delta Force had asked us to take part in the voting for  the 
best demo entered in the competition at the conference, so we had 
to get back to the hall for 10 pm.
     It  was chaos when we arrived back,  all of us  judges  were 
huddled around an ST on which we would view the screens.  It  was 
made  very  difficult  by  the fact that  everyone  else  at  the 
conference wanted to see all the screens.  I must say there  were 
some amazingly good screens,  some very good screens,  some  good 
screens and a few crappy ones....
     The results of the trial by ICC #2 jury were:

   1> The Overlanders- A sort of plama rasters jobbie
   2> Legacy- Rotating 3D vector cube with animations inside
   3> The Respectables- Star bubbles & a strange exploding scroll

     I  think that these are the order that I placed the  screens 
in,  but  also the other screen of note was by TLB ( Which was  a 
VERY well done sort of chaos screen with acid type soundtrack ). 
But alas somebody had to win.....
     The  Overlanders  were  then presented with  a  rather  nice 
trophy  by Delta Force.  This was the beginning of  the  noisiest 
night of all while at the conference......


Sunday 4th August 1991 ( The last day of the ICC #2 )
     
     At  8:30 am I was awoken by the assorted  beeps,  belps  and 
clicks of all the ST's down in the hall. Mind you, Bilbo was also 
doing a good impression of a chainsaw with his snoring!  I  think 
that  I'd had about 6 hours sleep on the prevoius night so I  was 
feeling quite shagged.                                  
     I spent most of the morning typing some of this article  and 
the rest just thinking about how tired I was.....
     Bilbo rose from his pit at about 11am ( I think ) and if  he 
felt as rough as he looked then he would have been feeling pretty 
crap indeed.
     All  the  Coca Cola was gone by this  time,  but  there  was 
plenty of dried bread for breakfast.  ( Oh,  how nice,  bread for 
breakfast again! )
     We de-flated our airbeds etc and checked that everything was 
packed  up safely in  our  suitcases.   
     Okay,  so  it was now 1:30pm,  we were really hungry  again. 
It  was a Sunday and all the shops ( All?  That should that  be 
THE shop !  ) were closed. But the pub around the corner would be 
open  for sure.  Should we got to this pub which we  knew  served 
food until 2 o'clock and try to order some food in the hope  that 
we may get something that was edible?  Erm, Remembering of course 
that  we  cannot read or speak German and the staff  there  don't 
speak English.....
     Taaraa!  Our saviour Questlord to the recue ! He went to pub 
with  us,  although  he  said he was not going  to  eat  anything 
himself as he was not hungry. I had chicken and chips with salad.
Bilbo had to have a mushroom omlete because they didn't have  any 
pizza mit thunfische, krabben und knoblauch. Questlord managed to 
force down some vinersnitchel,  with some croquettes.  ( Or as we 
told  him  they  were called in English:  'Can I  have  a  gobble 
please?' ).
     Even  better  still he paid the bill.  Many thanks  to  you, 
Questlord of Delta Force for being such a nice guy.
     Everybody  was  packing up when we returned and we  saw  off 
most of those leaving.  We should have some really good photos of 
the event when we get them back from the developers.
     By 4pm there was hardly anybody left.  The Delta Force  team 
were busy clearing up all the associated shite that had been left 
behind  by all the attending masses.  The only other people  left 
were some of the Exceptions, most of Electra and of course us.
     Bilbo  and  I had to leave for the airport  at  5pm,  so  we 
decided  that we'd better re-check that all our  belongings  were 
safely packed up.  Looking through my suitcase I realised I could 
not find my passport......  After half an hour of looking through 
all my baggage I realised that it was indeed gone....  My stomach 
turned.  'Hell,  what the shit do I do now?' I thought to myself. 
Without a passport I may have been stuck in Germany  forever.  As 
the  news spread around the remaining visitors I started  getting 
lots of 'advice' on what 'nice' things would probaly happen to me 
when I tried to leave the country without a passport....
     Slime was taking us to the airport and so I asked him if  he 
could  take  us  staight away as there would  obviously  be  some 
hassle with the authorities. ( At the very least! ). 
     We climbed into Slimes tiny 2CV ( if you saw Slime you would 
never guess that he owned such a car! ) and set off to Stuttgart.
We all stayed pretty silent as we travelled,  Newmode was  asleep 
as  he'd  been awake all night coding the reset  screen  for  the 
conventions 'Punish your Machine' demo.  Slime said, ' Ha! I feel 
excited  for  what  is going to happen at  the  airport!'  Thanks 
Slime.....
     We  arrived there at about 5:15 pm.  The airline  said  that 
officially I could not travel on one of their planes without them 
seeing  my  passport.  All I had was a Visa card  and  a  medical 
insurance  certificate.  The woman behind the counter checked  my 
Visa card details on the computer.  'Okay,  We'll let you travel' 
she said.  First hurdle completed.....
      I checked in my baggage and was told to go straight to  the 
customs/immegration  booths  and  see if they  would  let  me  go 
through, if not, then I wouldn't be able to travel. ( She told me 
that  if they were not checking passports then I should  not  say 
anything and just go through...)
     Before  going  through we thanked Newmode &  Slime  for  all 
their  help and stuff.  They said they'd wait in case I  couldn't 
get  through.  ( I'm sure Slime just wanted to see me get  wisked 
away to prison by the German Police!  ).
     When we got  there the guard was checking all passports.....
     I blurted to him that I'd lost my passport. He asked me lots 
of questions and then went off after telling me to wait. Another, 
more  official  looking guy came over and asked me all  the  same 
questions.  He asked to see Bilbos passport and asked where  we'd 
been etc and how well we knew each other.  'Okay,  go' he said as 
he waved us through to the departure lounge.  Phew!      
We had a couple of hours to kill, so we went to the bar and had a 
few coffees. After that we both called our wives and then visited 
all the duty free shops where Bilbo bought quite a lot of  stuff. 
I  didn't see any thing that I really fancied (except a  Gameboy, 
but  they didn't have any in stock...  ) and I didn't think  that 
the prices were particularly cheap.
     The  customs/immegration  guard who had let  me  go  through 
approached  us.  'Shit!' I thought,  'He's changed his mind.'  He 
handed  Bilbo a handful of documents.  Yes,  Bilbo had  left  his 
passport,  boarding pass and ticket on top of the telephone  when 
he phoned his wife. I bet he thought that we were a right pair of 
English Pillocks......
     At 7:45pm we boarded the plane and had a  rather  uneventful 
journey to Birmingham.
     One  of the stewardesses gave me some advice about  what  to 
say to the English immegation people who would be waiting for me.
     I  had to answer loads of questions about myself as the  guy 
behind  the counter tried to out-pysch me.  Eventually he let  me 
through......
     Bilbo  gave  his little Renault 5 Turbo some hammer  on  the 
homeward journey to good old Yorkshire. 
     He made a comment:
' Good old England.  I've got a car, I can go where I like. I can 
buy  food  and  know what I'm eating.  I  can  ask  somebody  for 
directions and understand what he's saying. I can sleep in my own 
bed tonight. It's great to be home!'
     My sentiments exactly.....
     
     So, to sum up:
     We  had  a great time in Germany at the second  Delta  Force 
International Coding Conference. We'd met some great people. We'd 
mixed with the famous people of the demo/games world.  We'd  been 
beaten  at Midi Maze by those same people.  We'd had some  cheeky 
git sleeping in our beds.  We'd had little or no sleep. We'd been 
pestered by flys and wasps.  We'd been made welcome by our hosts, 
Delta  Force.  But  it  really was good to be home  in  good  old 
England.
     
     Finally, Bilbo and myself would like to extend our thanks to 
all  the members of Delta Force who made us so  welcome.  (Slime, 
Newmode, Chaos Inc and Questlord ).
     Also,  to all of the people we met there, we look forward to 
seeing you all again in the near future.

 
                                                  Stick.

PS   See you at next years bash!
