This  is just a quick look at the Bitmaps next  imminent  release, 
MAGIC POCKETS, which is due out shortly..

This is the tale of the BITMAP kid, who appears to be able to keep 
a whole world in his trousers!!  Sorry, that will be ultimately be 
something  like five worlds by the time the Bitmaps have  finished 
with  him!!!!  The  unpleasant  suggestive laughter rising  to  an 
uncontrollable  pitch,  I  hastily add that the blessings  in  the 
trouser  dept.  relate  solely to his bottomless pockets.  (He has 
probably got a tiny minute todger, really..)

Anyway,  I  have  had a quick play or three,  of the first  level, 
which  is set in a cavern system,  the graphics being done by  the 
same artist as for GODS,  and the style can safely be described as 
"Cutesy GODs.." Your mission (Should you choose to accept it..) is 
to  recover  your  lost  toys,  in this level,  a lost  Bike,  and 
gameplay  follows  the traditional 'explore and kill  anything  in 
your path' format..

There  is  a  major  weapon,  a whirlwind which is  fired  in  the 
traditional manner,  this can also be held down for greater power, 
giving either a 'One hit kill' or can trap monsters,  when at it's 
most  powerful,  you  then  jump  on the monster  trapped  in  the 
whirlwind,  for extra points and bonuses..  It is also possible to 
enter a whirlwind yourself, and flick around the screen, to either 
get  to otherwise inaccessible ledges,  or to zap as many beasties 
as you can whilst in an invunerable state...

There are many different bonuses,  for points, extra firepower, or 
extra lives, and such power-ups as a laser helmet or smartbomb can 
be  found on the way as well.  Some of the creatures have a  semi-
intelligent set of routines, reminiscent of GODS, and either evade 
or come after you, depending on whom they are... 

The  music  part is to be done by none other than BETTY  BOO,  the 
sound FX, being, probably the usual chip cacophony...

Overall,  looks  like  another interesting release..  If you liked 
GODS, this is very similar, but more lighthearted...

RATINGS:- No full game, no ratings.....

ALSO, The game after that, THE CHAOS ENGINE, is due in the Autumn, 
is there any way of stopping these people???
