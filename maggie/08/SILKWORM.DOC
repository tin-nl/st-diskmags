    Yet another game where the box contains one disk and a tiny booklet with a
short irelevent plot and loading instructions (i.e. Bung it in drive and turn
on (Unless you are an Amiga owner wwho must wait 30 seconds between turning his
games machine off and on again(HA!))). Silkworm is now a buget game so it comes
in a paper-thin box a fraction of a normal box.
    I bought this game on the strength of the Amiga version and I was not
disapointed taking into account the games age. The game boots up with some
weedy soundchip music and you can use the options screen to choose your method
of control from two joysticks and the keyboard.
    In case you don't know (Where have you been??), the game is designed for
two players with one being the helicopter and the other being the jeep. You can
play with one player but its much more fun with two (So all you STFM owners,
lift up the keyboard, wrench the mouse out and plug the second bleeding
joystick in (GROAN!)).
    You start off with basic weapons and set off on the first level where you
are imediately met by enemy helicopters, trucks firing missiles and the
goosecopter. This armored helicopter (Which just happens to look like a goose)
need to be shot in the middle but has a long neck which gets in the way. When
you do destroy it you are rewarded with a twin shot. Land mines, when shot,
release a gas cloud which you can either fly into as a shield or shoot for a
smartbomb effect. At the end of the level you either meet a giant helicopter or
tank. This needs more shots to destroy the higher the level you are on is. Then
you go on to the next level.
    There are about half a dozen different scrolling backgrounds which repeat
themselves. Some of the backdrops are good. The desert one looks quite good
while the hills and clouds one looks like a five year old's colouring book. The
sprites are of varied sizes although most of them are smallish but they look
OK.
    The sound is limeted to just effects but the explosions are reasonably
good.
    The gameplay very much depends on whether you are the helicopter or the
jeep. The helicopter responds well but the jeep takes some getting used to as
the gun is directional and you need to hold the button down to aim the gun. I
find the keyboard slightly easier to use except the instructions don't tell you
which keys to use so i worked them out for myself.
    You get two credits so when you die you can start again at the same
position. This is handy with two players as if you get killed in a difficult
bit you can wait for the other player to get past it until you come back to
life.
    So its an old game but it is fairly good and its cheap. The best bit
however is the fights you can get into over who gets to be the helicopter.

Silly Section:
    This review took about 20 minutes to write and while writing it I:
    1)   Didn't drink any coke.
    2)   Listened to Delicate sound of thunder by Pink Floyd.
    3)   Told my little brother to Sod off once.
    4)   Went to the toilet.
    5)   Farted.
    6)   Spent five of the twenty minutes actualy typing.
