
                    The BETTER THAN LIFE demo
                    By ACO and FLAIR.........

 Review by CIH - Late July 1991...

After  what  has been a very long barren period for  the  ST  demo 
scene,  there  are signs of movement once more,  as I clutch in my 
hand,  a  strange  disk entitled "Better than Life" this  offering 
being  from two Scottish guys ACO and FLAIR,  let us take a closer 
look children....

The first thing we are told,  this is a STOS megademo, what STOS!! 
a language for coding Ocean games!!  ....  Well this little effort 
is  not  too shabby at all,  a screen by screen account  will  now 
follow...

Booting up reveals a fullscreen thing with millions of logos,  and 
no  borders,  the  intro screen proper then loads to  reveal  some 
fancy   font   lettering  in  the  centre  of  the   screen,   and 
vectorballs!!!  'scuse the multiple exclamation marks, but this is 
in  the  'not  really  expected in  a  STOS  demo'  category,  the 
vectorballs  move a bit slowly,  but we are informed that this was 
done  in  a hurry,  and that a better version will follow  in  the 
forthcoming 'Cunning Demos'

(In  fact,  I have seen another screen,  intended for the 'Cunning 
Demos'  proper,  this  being  a vectorballs screen,  which  was  a 
similar quality to the MINDBOMB screen, the only thing missing (So 
far..) was the shimmery watery layer, not baaaaaaaaadddd!!)

A quick stab at the 'return' key puts you into the main menu which 
consists  of a scroller at the bottom of the screen,  and lots  of 
little   piccys  'previewing'  the  screens  which  are   joystick 
selectable..

1.  To kick off,  the SAUCE SCREEN, which has two scrollers at the 
top  and  bottom of the screen,  and a centre section filled  with 
various  graphix,  the  scrolltext is short,  and you then get the 
chance to write your own, one of the less spectacular screens..

2.  YOU WOULDN'T LET IT LIE - The title of the next screen,  which 
has  a digi-drums tune from WINGS OF DEATH including  the  'Please 
Wait' intro.  This has multi-layer 'jaggy' parallax scrolling, and 
to look at,  very much resembles the third TCB screen in the Union 
Demo, pretty good...

3.  TRON TECH screen, guess what this is??? Well it is a half-size 
version of the famous TCB Tech-Tron screen,  from SOWATT, in spite 
of being a minature version, including the same music, it is still 
very good indeed, one of the best three screens in the demo...

4.  CYRIL  SMITH  WAS BORN PART III,  wins the strangest title  by 
about three and a quarter light years,  another multi-plane screen 
with things going on over different layers of the screen, but this 
one is a bit slow and jerky..

5.  LED screen,  yet another 'Homage' to The Carebears,  this is a 
STOS  replica of the LED screen in the CUDDLY DEMOS,  albeit  with 
the colour bars missing.  (The screen originally had them, but had 
to  be  fixed to run properly and so lost that bit..)  This  is  a 
guest screen by the MUTANT..

6.  GO AHEAD PUNK MAKE MY DAY,  is arguably the best screen on the 
demo,  featuring  two multiplane graphix scrollers,  a scrolltext, 
and a large virtual centre-of-screen picture which scrolls up  and 
down, the rate of which is controllable by the Joystick, also some 
COUNT  ZERO  music,  the  graphix are typically  weird,  featuring 
'portraits' of the two people behind the demo,  bananas, etc, this 
was inspired by a CYBERPUNK screen, hence the title, only this one 
runs at 50khz...

7.  TOY HOUSE,  the other best screen on the demo, is based on the 
full screen text scroll from, yup you've guessed, the CUDDLY DEMOS
and manages to lose absolutely nothing in translation,  apart from 
the  sample,  which  is replaced by soundchip music,  and has  the 
cryptic  message  "There is nothing I like better than  pouring  a 
bucket  of cement over a toy house.." (Or  something..)  Scrolling 
upwards behind the text scroller...

8.  BANANA,  two scrolling things which go upward, at the left and 
right hand sides of the screen, and a wavy multi-part scrolltext.. 
Absolutely  no  trace of any bananas whatsoever,  these all  being 
used up elsewhere in the demo...

9.  PLASTIC  FANTASTIC,  another  excellent screen,  more digi-drum 
music  c/o  Mad Max,  a vomit-inducing multi-plane patterned  full 
screen, and a triple scrolltext, two of which bounce...

10.  GARY(?)  a  guest screen by Whee The Fibble,  consisting of a 
Spiderman piccy, the letters 'WHEE THE FIBBLE' which flash in time 
to the music, and a full screen vertical scroll text...

11.  STORM provide the final screen, this guest screen was written 
in  assembler,  but I think they must have had an off day,  as the 
only thing to distinguish it as an assembly language screen is the 
indicator bars in the border, it does have several soundchip tunes 
to choose from,  a scroller, and some piccys of Marvel (TM) comics 
characters...

This demo is actually a prequel to the forthcoming 'CUNNING DEMOS' 
one  report  puts this work as being a three disk epic,  and  that 
this  demo was to ease the overflow of work already done,  we  are 
told  that ACO and FLAIR have notched up about 50 screens  between 
them!!!!!!!! Watch this space.....

Some ratings:-

GRAPHIX:- 69% - Variable quality, some screens are quite good, but 
some of the others are not that exciting to look at...

SONIX:-  77% - All screens have soundchip musix,  two of them even 
have  the  infamous MAD MAX digi-drums,  these are no feeble  STOS 
tunes either,  but the real thing... Any chance of some samples or 
MODs in the next demo???

GEE-WHIZZ:-  79% A new category,  which neatly covers things  like 
technical ability,  originality, accurate reproduction of demos on 
"superior"  machines  etc,  in  this  case,  the aim has  been  to 
impersonate   (often  successfully)  certain  screens  on   famous 
earlier ST demos,  especially TCB's work,  most screens are smooth 
running and often indistinguishable from their ASM counterparts..

OVERALL:- 78% - There is nothing drastically new here,  but it has 
been  done  in  an  unfashionable  language,   and  done  well,  I 
personally  liked  this demo...  If these guys get  into  Assembly 
language,  and/or  get some original ideas for screens,  then they 
will be very dangerous indeed..
