
                        THE FINAL WHISTLE
                        <--------------->

Maggie's resident Kick Off 2 Guru,  Leon O'Reilly,  takes a  look 
at Anco's latest attempt to milk the football market.

     The best just got better! Kick Off 2 was an all time classic 
game but it did have a few faults,  most noticeably poor graphics 
and sound.  Unfortunately these haven't really changed, but there 
are some noticeable enhancements.
     On  load  up  you are greeted with a picture  of  a  referee 
who  bears  a striking resemblence to George  'Porkme'  Courtney. 
Annoyingly,  you have to swap disks and put in your original Kick 
Off  2  disk,  then re-insert the Final Whistle disk.  I  see  no 
reason  for this as all the necessary data for the game  appears 
to be on the Final Whistle disk. It is just checking to make sure 
you  own  an original version of Kick Off 2,  but as  just  about 
every ST owning football fan does,  this is just a waste of  time 
and a hassle that should've been ironed out.
     The introductory screen has barely changed from the original 
apart  from a small piece of text under the main KO2  logo  which 
reads "FINAL WHISTLE".  The main menu options are also  identical 
to KO2,  but when you delve into the sub-menus you find some  new 
options.  In the 'OPTIONS' menu you can now put 'offside' on  and 
off  -  I feature I will discuss later.  You can also  have  some 
exciting new pitches:
ICY  - Increases ball pace and travel.  Players have to  purchase 
       Ice-skates to make full use of this surface.  Torville  & 
       Dean are on the transfer market at reasonable prices.
MUDDY- Ball travel reduced both in air and on ground.
BUMPY- This pitch resembles Leon Britain's face so you will  find 
       the  ball  bouncing about all over the place.  This  is  a 
       simulation of a non-league ground,  and it does remind  me 
       of Brammal lane.
WEMBLY-Which is virtually Sheffield Wednesday's home ground!

     The  problem with this pitches is that graphically they  all 
look the same - the programmers blame this on the limitations  of 
the ST's scrolling abilities but I blame it on lame coding.  They 
could've  done an STE version with better on-pitch  graphics  and 
I'm sure they could get the STFM to scroll a lot better than they 
do.

     When  you  go  onto  team  selection  you  notice  that  the 
international teams have changed from KO2.  Sob. There is no more 
Germany with N.S. Watson etc, no more France with F.T.B. Sinclair 
et al.  What you do get is larger squads with well known names in 
them.  The German squad has Lothar Mattheus and Berti Vogts in it 
among  others,  and  Sweden  has  Roland  Nilsson  the  Sheffield 
Wednesday right back in it!
     By pressing space while your cursor is on a player, you will 
be able to view his attributes. This include:
Name,  Position,  Age,  Weight, Height (Spelt as Hieght!!), Pass, 
Shoot,  Tackle,   Keep,   Pace,   Agility,  Stamina,  Resilience, 
Aggression and Flair.
     Flair  is  a new attribute (all the rest  were  featured  in 
Player  Manager).  A player with flair is more likely to  make  a 
play for the ball.
     Once you've made your selection you can save it to disk  and 
this will save you the trouble of reselecting the team every time 
you play.
     There  are  a number of differences in the  game,  the  most 
noticeable  being the ability to flick the ball and  do  overhead 
kicks.  To flick the ball you trap the ball, reverse the joystick 
direction  and  release  fire.
      Overhead kicks are truly spectacular.  When the ball  comes 
over  your  head you simply reverse the  joystick  direction  and 
your  player  will fall onto his back and attempt to  volley  the 
ball  from whence it came.  There is something really  satisfying 
about  doing  these kicks,  especially when they  take  the  ball 
right into the opposition penalty area.  If you miss the ball you 
can  leave gaps in your defence with players lying on  the  pitch 
doing aerobics while the opposition runs in on goal.
     Corners have changed for the better. Instead of a box coming 
up allowing you to select the direction of the corner,  it allows 
you  to select the power of the corner from low (tap the ball  to 
the  nearest player) to high (try and knock out  satellites  with 
the ball).   You press fire a second time to determine the height 
of the ball - the longer you hold down fire,  the higher the ball 
goes.  Before you reach the ball you can give it left/right  bias 
by  moving the joystick.  After this,  Aftertouch can be used  as 
normal. Corners are now potentially much more dangerous though it 
is  going  to  take  a  while to  work  out  which  is  the  best 
combination of power, height, direction and aftertouch.
     Throw-ins,  on  the other hand,  are ghastly.  You move  the 
joytsick  in the direction you want to throw and hold down  fire. 
The longer fire is held,  the further the ball goes.  The problem 
is that the ball never seems to go to one of your players.  It is 
best  if you do nothing and let the computer throw the  ball  for 
you.
     Also on the pitch are a referee and two linesmen,  these are 
just there for cosmetic purposes but the animation where the  ref 
takes out a card is amusing. Unfortunately there aren't any other 
extra graphics,  no advertising hordings,  no stands, no kamikaze 
fans attempting to murder the ref. 
     The Final Whistle's version of Offside is very disappointing. 
Anco  have  either misinterpreted the offside rule  or  found  it 
wasn't  feasible to include it in a computer game.  In the  Final 
Whistle  you  can't  touch the ball if you are  behind  the  last 
defender.  This  means  that if you are onside when the  ball  is 
played  and  you  beat the defender to the ball  you  are  judged 
offside which is wholly incorrect.  Turn this option off it  will 
just  create  arguments and shouts of  obscenities  against  the 
'blind linesmen'.
     
     Although  this review seems to heavily criticise  the  game, 
that  doesn't mean I don't like.  Everyone moans at Kick Off  2's 
lameness, but no-one can doubt its playability. The Final Whistle 
gives  Kick  Off 2 a new lease of life with  extra  ball  control 
features, enhanced squads and tougher opposition - Kick Off 2 was 
becoming  slightly boring as I won every game scoring  in  double 
figures,  but  I  won't  be doing that for  some  time  in  Final 
Whistle.
     This is the most playable game on the ST. It hasn't good the 
best graphics or sound, and the coding is just above average, but 
the  game itself is the best about.  Start playing this  now  and 
expect to be still loving every minute of it this time next year, 
something that can't be said for any other game.

Aren't  you lovely Maggie readers lucky?  Even ST Format  haven't 
reviewed this yet! Remember, the biggies are first in Maggie!!
