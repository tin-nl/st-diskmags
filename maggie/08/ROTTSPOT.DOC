                 ROTTSPOT III - The son of the sequel
()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()

 Some more ramblings from the random side by CIH.....

WELL  well  WELL  boys  and girls,  another  Maggie,  and  another 
ROTTSPOT,  how  will we cope my dears??  Will it be as -erm HYPER-
EXTENDED as the previous one in issue 5..

We sincerely hope not,  as to get that far,  I would need to spend 
about 24 hours per day on the keyboard for about two weeks,  which 
does  not  take  into  account the need  to  eat/sleep/go  to  the 
toilet/go  to work,  added to which,  we got the "Luxury" of about 
four or five months before issue 5 was released... This time, I am 
informed by Mike S.  that the next issue of Maggie is due in about 
a month NNNNGGGGHHHH!!!! get writing.....

To  kick  off  properly,   I  am  announcing  the  death  of  DEAD 
CELEBRITIES as a regular column for a number of reasons..

1:-  They  never  could get the spelling right,  it is  NOT  'Dead 
Celebreties' and never has been....

2:- Not that many celebrities actually die when it is  convenient, 
there you are hanging around for months and months,  then suddenly 
six pop-off at once.. Infuriating!!!

3:-  We  need  the  space for several  new  and  memory  consuming 
projects for Maggie,  including some very large DOCs,  and several 
new ideas for improving the presentaion side of things..

4:- Alright, I admit it, I'm running out of ideas!!!

I  will  bring  it back from time to time,  as any good  ideas  or 
suggestions  fall  due,  and  I will be  retaining  the  companion 
feature  "DEAD  NONENTITIES"  as there is NEVER  any  shortage  of 
material for that...

This month, a special 'Nonentities' piece on..........

                   THE UPSIDER...

The  Upsider is the fly on the wall,  a repository of all the dark 
secrets of the Computer industry,  so dark,  in fact,  that in his 
weekly  column,  in a well known weekly computer magazine,  nobody 
knows what the hell he is talking about....

The Upsider knows all about the pain and anguish that those  nasty 
HIGH  COURT  WRITS  can  bring,  they are SO  EXPENSIVE,  so  that 
anything  juicy and salacious,  has to be disguised and couched in 
the most general terms...

The Upsider might as well be deep in the hotbed of intrigue of the 
FROZEN  FOOD  PACKAGING  INDUSTRY,   for  all  the  use  that  his 
information is to the readership, indeed several senior management 
types   at  'Birdseye'  who  read  NEW  COMPUTER   EXPRESS   (Oops 
whatagiveaway!) recognised themselves in the 'Insider' column  (Oh 
shittttt I've done it again!!!) and are deeply alarmed....

Just to show that two can play at that game, here goes:-

Just  which company who is producing a sampling cartridge for  the 
ST  whose  name begins with 'M' is MOST  DISPLEASED  with  another 
company  whose name also begins with 'M',  as they think that  the 
two  designs have rather too much in common,  except for the  fact 
that one design has more airspace in it than the other ???

Or...

Which  well-known  softco  (Also beginning with  the  letter  'M', 
funnily  enough??) has just produced a mission disk for it's  top-
selling Flight-sim, concerning recent events in Iraq..... When the 
manual for the original program stated that they had no wish to do 
such  a  thing,  as the Gulf War was 'Too recent' in some  peoples 
minds,  IE.  to  avoid  accusations of poor taste...  (WHOOPS!  too 
late!!)

Baseless rumours, probably...

Or take this as an example of the real McCoy:-

"Paris  is  lovely  in July.  There's romance in the air  and  the 
chance  to  rebuild  relationships  which  might  well  have  been 
reaching breaking point.  That's the theory anyway.  Unhappily for 
certain   managing   directors   of   certain   computer   dealers 
(insultingly  called  'Box-Shifters'  in  the  trade)  theory  and 
practice  don't always reach a harmonious climax.  Especially when 
the second half of the fraught relationship - The wife - is not in 
Paris at all. Now remember business people, attention to detail is 
all.  If you say that you are going to Paris alone, make sure that 
the  switchboard  knows  it  is not  to  tell  callers  that  your  
secretary is with you..."  (NCE issue 143, 3rd Aug 1991)

Anybody the wiser????? Thought not.....

Don't ask me,  I don't know,  I am the Upsider,  who lurks in dark 
corners,  mumbling inaudibly to himself..... I look really good in 
a trenchcoat with the collar turned up....

Now every ROTTSPOT has it's day, and it's INEVITABLE COMPUTER SHOW 
REPORT,  and  this  time it is the turn of the 16BIT  Show,  which 
happened all over the Novotel like a rogue puddle of vomit...

The journey was Courtesy of British Rail thing, and was remarkably 
0ncident  free  for  a change,  There were two of us,  this  time, 
myself,  and Nathan G....  The other 50% of the 'RIVER ISLAND SOCK 
CREW'  (R.I.S.C.  - Producers of some interesting stuff which  ONE 
DAY  may  become  a demo???) We managed to pass  the  journey,  by 
indigestion (Myself and British Rail Bacon roll) and talking about 
hard  drives  respectively,  by  the time the  train  reached  the 
dreaded "One mile to Euston Station" sign, we were on to the topic 
of laser scanning the brain to erase memory and reprogramme people 
- George Orwell - Eat your heart out!!!!

Upon reaching the "One mile to Euston" sign,  the train was sucked 
in  to  the labyrinthic network of dead ends and  'Stop'  signals, 
never to be seen again.... So how did we get to the show???

The Novotel a year ago,  was the launching platform for MAGGIE, in 
fact,  and  the first thing to be found was Maggie issue 7,  which 
Mike  had  spent  up to about four  O'clock  (Yes,  the  'Morning' 
version  of  four O'clock..) finishing..  So Mike was,  to put  it 
mildly, thoroughly Shagged out, at the same time, he had the first 
production copies of the new Lost Boys game 'Monster Business'  on 
sale,  and as we watched,  he managed to convince a punter to part 
with  some  cash  for a copy..  Our eyes were drawn to  the  other 
product that Eclipse had on their stall:-

               (((((((( AUDIO SCULPTURE ))))))))

Or Sync Tracker to it's many friends....

AT  LAST  on release!!!!!   - But not quite,  as there was only  a 
single  demo version on the stand,  some boxes were due to turn up 
later,  but  in  the  meantime,  we enjoyed the "50KHZ STE  STEREO 
option,  which  was  plugged into some pretty funky speakers,  and 
tried  to load in our special mega large 400kb 'Art of Noise'  mix 
Module,  the machine,  a 1040 STE coughed,  but gracefully did not 
crash..  Damn....  We  thought,  it  did not play it either though, 
having  loaded  on some other R.I.S.C.  'loony tunes' on  it,  and 
liking the end result,  we thought,  yes, let's get one, only they 
still  didn't  have any in stock ,so Nathan (Whose other  name  is 
'Owen  Money'..)  wrote out a cheque,  to order one of these  fine 
beasties....

...At the time of writing (2nd August) we are still waiting...

Other  bits  of  the show,  both the TCB  Monster  cartridge,  and 
Microdeal's Playback,  seemed to be everywhere,  even virtually to 
the extent of the bar offering one free with a packet of crisps..

Nathan ordered a rather peculiar drink in a small glass,  as I was 
buying  the round,  I collected the pained look from the  barman.. 
One  of the purposes of the trip was to shop for a hard drive  for 
my machine,  but after being buffeted by the crowds, going down to 
the show,  and also in the show,  the idea of lugging one of these 
back palled a bit, so I got an Optical mouse, and two megs of SIMM 
chips  instead,  whilst Nathan looked longingly around the  Hisoft 
stand, looking for DEVPAC 3, but came away with the latest version 
of the  Proflight Tornado simulator thing instead...

By  the time we went around the 'downstairs' portion of the  show, 
which  was at a "Having the breath crushed out of your body  room" 
only state, and  returned to the sanctuary of the  Eclipse  stand, 
Mike had sold some more copies of MONSTER BUSINESS, and the French 
Guys were still extolling the many brilliant bits of Sync Tracker, 
there were some very strange things being done with the help of an 
onboard  FM  and speeech synthesiser to Michael  Jackson..  (Being 
given a post-pubescent voice, possibly??) 
There was also a running demo of WINGS OF DEATH II, which is to be 
published by Eclipse as well,  and looks very interesting, even at 
this early stage...

But there was still no sign of any Sync Trackers on sale..

So we took in the 16/32 Bit,  and Riverdene PDL's, "Sorry sir, the 
ST demo scene's a bit grim and lifeless at the moment.." The  best 
demo being the Amiga Anti-Lemmings Demo, which is 2mb only (I hope 
it is converted to the ST, as it is an animation, and there are no 
fancy blitter tricks involved..)

About,  mid-afternoon,  we left, with still no Sync Tracker copies 
on  sale,  our  order being left,  and still waiting to hear  from 
Eclipse.. Overall, a reasonable show, very overpopulated, but with 
some  good bargains to be found (In barely legible ball-point  pen 
in some cases..) For the really curious,  Llamasoft, complete with 
Jeff  Minter were there,  and Microdeal were 'Vogueing' it up with 
their first CDTV program, a digital remixer...

"Vogue vogue vogue vogue.."

And again "Vogue, vogue, vogue vogue."

And again...........

Talking  about  shows,  there is the "Thing at Earls Court   which 
will  try  to  cram  too many people into  as  tight  a  space  as 
possible, and leave about three-quarters of the hall empty", which 
takes place in early September...  Will U.S. GOLD have their usual 
stand, the bright red one with the Ferrari, which has the odour of 
somebody  being  recently sick on it,  and which has largely  been 
demolished by Sunday???  It is strange that everybody will go down 
anyway,  as  there  will  probably only be about  three  companies 
actually  doing anything new and interesting for the ST,  (One  of 
these will almost certainly be MPH...)

It  will  have live music acts,  the 'Living Room of the  Future', 
T.V.  and radio broadcasts,  celebrity appearances, and (Possibly) 
even  some  computers????  The  advertising copy "It's  Mega  man" 
suggests that it is an event for baseball caps worn back-to-front, 
which would be deeply crap...

Still, I bet everybody will be down there, see ya there!!!

15/8/91....
(Well  NO THEY WON'T it now seems,  as this show has gone over  to 
TRADE   ONLY,   rather  abruptly,   and  without  an  accompanying 
explanation,  this is interesting, as advance tickets have been on 
sale,  and  there  has  been  prominent advertising  for  about  a 
month....)

WATCH THIS SPACE.........

 UNBELIEVABLY HUGE SUMS OF MONEY DEPT...

BRITISH TELECOM,  aren't they great!!!  They are making about œ107 
per  second,  that  is,  every second of every minute of..(Alright 
Alright I get the drift - ED..) I worked it out that on this  kind 
of income,  it would be possible to buy a house every ten minutes, 
for example, a really long lunch with brandy and cigars afterwards 
would  see you safely into the millionaire bracket,  you could buy 
about twenty Atari ST's a minute, and about three TT's in the same 
time  period...  The really frightening thing is that we did  this 
exercise at work,  and the standard eight-digit pocket calculators 
COULD  NOT COPE with the really huge numbers,  and bottled out  at 
about 'Thirty-three million'....

ROTTSPOTT  can exclusively reveal that the recent research into  a 
'Teraflop'  computer,  capable of a million,  million calculations 
per  second  HAS  NOT been  created  for  artificial  intelligence 
research,  or  to analyse global climate patterns,  but for a much 
bigger job... TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL BT's MASSES OF MONEY!!!

Before  I close,  isn't it getting interesting on the new  machine 
front  for  Atari,  the configurations of some new,  very exciting 
ST's  are elsewhere in the Maggie,  and now there would seem to be 
definite moves towards a CDI based CD-Rom drive,  (CDI, as in "Haw 
Haw Commodore, you stuck your neck out too far, didn't you!!")

Final  para:- Well it is time to go,  these being the final  lines 
for this issue of Maggie, it is Goodbye from me, thanks to all the 
people  who have written with articles or screens,  or demos,  and 
see you all next time, (Probably see some of you at the E.C.E.S in 
Sept.. HA HAHAHAHAHA !!!!)

It is now about the 15/8/91, where is dat Sync Tracker (Dey cashed 
our cheque on the 26/7/91) Hurry up guys....)

CIH Yeti again (C) 15/8/91...
