                            The MICROBOX
       
                     The New Car from JTS Atari
                  

SHOCK NEWS from JTS Atari's headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. 
Romours have been circulating for a while on the firms "developments" 
on a project known as the "MicroBox". It can be EXCLUSIVELY REVEALED 
by the Maggie team that the MicorBox is not in fact a computer, but a 
revolutionary new car.

The specification of the new car is impressive. We have gleaned the 
following information from a memo leaked by a JTS Atari insider:
	
*	The car will feature a remarkable 32-cylinder engine. However, 
	only 16 of the cylinders will be connected to the drive shaft.
	The prescence of the other 16 cylinders is merely required so 
	they can write "32-cylinder engine" on the back.

*	Shunning popular demand, Atari are using custom components in 
	the new cars instead of industry-standard ones. Examples are 
	wheels, doors, and fuel.
	
*	In keeping with tradition, the steering wheel connects to the 
	MicorBox underneath the car in the most awkward place Atari
	could find.
	
*	Even though various bugs in the MicroBox have been discovered 
	(such as the "40 MPH" bug and the "sticky accelerator" bug 
	when you turn the ignition on),	patch bumper-stickers are 
	being worked on by Atari's TOSsers.
	
*	Third-party suppliers are expected to develop bigger engines 
	for the MicroBox. However, fitting most of them will require 
	the owner to take the seats out and purchase a new, bigger
	body for their MicroBox.
	
*	Atari are expected to follow the launch of the MicorBox with 
	an "aggressive advertising campaign covering various medias". 
	Bob Gleadow, JTS Atari UK - "Yep. We will this time. Honest."

Atari have been critiscised about their dismal history with regards to 
distribution and support of their products.

Gleadow - "Distribution?? Oh, Crikey. I hadn't thought of that". 

What about the people who want to buy one? 

"BUY?!?!? We don't make these things for people to BUY - we make them 
to sit in our warehouse, along with the CDAR drives and ST Books. Hey, 
we may even bury them in the desert like we did with the E.T. carts."

Hmmm... So what about the support?

Don Thomas - "Eh... Support?!?!? Jack?"
Jack Tramiel - "Don't look at me..."
                                  
So it seems Atari are ready for their onslaught on the car market. The 
competition are wetting themselves. Laughing.

Jack Tramiel, Chairman:
	"We are very happy about this opportunity we now have in what 
	is, for us, an extrememly new market. It gives us a chance to 
	bugger something up on a scale which we have previously only 
	dreamed of."

Release Date: Real Soon Now¿.
