                            A GAME FOR THE FALCON030

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ganymed is the game you  get  free  if  you  register  for Martin Steen's Falcon
Pacman game "PacThem". Like "PacThem", Ganymed is  a conversion of a classic 80s
coin-op. Whilst "PacThem" concentrates on the famouse yellow pill gobbling ball,
Ganymed draws its inspiration from Asteroids.

Asteroids games on the ST are not new. One of the first games I remember playing
on my ST was an asteroids  clone  called  "Megaroids". Perhaps the reason that I
remember this game so well is that  it  is  one  of  the few that ran on my high
resolution monitor that for some reason I had decided to buy with my ST.

I have always enjoyed games of this type, so it was with some expectation that I
booted up Ganymed.

The introduction text warned me that Ganymed  was solely for registered users of
Pacthem and not for copying. This  text  was  in  German,  but you can alter the
langauage to English or Swedish depending on your favoured tongue.

The main menu caused two words  to  immediately  leap  into my head, these being
"Dave" and "Munsie". This looked just  like  something the Munster would cook up
for one of his  games.  There  is  some  text  in  the  foreground whilst in the
background we have a vertically scrolling (not  3D) starfield. At the top of the
screen is a Ganymed logo, whilst underneath  we are presented with four options.
As well as being able to "play"  and  "quit",  we can toggle the music and sound
effects on and off. The music consists of a techno style module playing at a low
volume.

At the press of a key we  are  into  the  game proper. In the background is what
looks like a digitised picture of a  planet. In the foreground is your spaceship
and some menacingly big asteroids. You are  armed  with a weapon that appears to
be the astronomic equivalent  of  a  pea  shooter.  Unlike  other games off this
genre, there appears to be no inertia  and  your thrusters don't propel you that
far so you craft is very easy to control.

The early levels are pretty easy. It  is  possible to complete them without even
moving the ship from its central  position!  The  first couple have levels start
with four asteroids rumbling around the screen,  but as you progress through the
game this number increases making the game progressively harder.

Another obstacle is the alien  ship,  and  a  right  annoying bastard he is. His
arrival is denoted by a buzzing  sound,  and  this  means "panic because you are
about to be shot and there is bugger all you can do about it". From time to time
in the later levels this alien will appear,  hover about a bit and then fire one
frighteningly accurate shot at you which is very difficult to avoid. Even if you
do manage to shoot it (unlikely) it will probably have got its shot in first and
your funeral will already be being arranged.

Although this game is on the "HiColour Games" label and everything is running in
true colour mode, it doesn't always look  that  way. The background planet has a
dotted almost dithered appearance. The  sprites  have  been  shaded to black and
have ugly outlines. The fonts on the introduction screens are lacking in colour.
It does look very sparse in comparison with the beautiful "Wotanoid".

The sound, on the other hand,  is  excellent.  There are loads of really fitting
sound effects that add a lot of atmosphere to the game. Asteroids explode with a
satisfying boom and your ship explodes with  an almightly bang. The alien has an
spooky accompanying sound (probably composed by Portishead) and when you finally
die you are treated to an evil cackle.

The real secret to "Ganymed"'s success is  in  its gameplay. As it starts off so
easy it really pulls you in. The craft  itself  is a dream to control so overall
Ganymed is a lot more easy to get  into  than some of its competitors. It really
is a very playable game.

Ganymed has enough going for it to be released  as a game in its own right. As a
free game for registered PacThem users,  it  is virtuality unbeatable. It should
encourage people to register for Martin Steen's game as it is well worth having.

Ganywhere. Ganytime. Ganyplace. Ganymed.
