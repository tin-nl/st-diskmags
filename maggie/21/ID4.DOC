Hollywood  exists on the poles of an uneasy duality,  Big Stars or  Big 
Explosions..  Big name star,  piffling little bang..  A bunch of people 
you've never really heard of, apart from a couple that might be sort of 
familiar,  (more  on that later) HUGE continent devastating explosions! 
It  would  just  break  everyones  budget  to  get  both  in  the  same 
production somehow..

Work out from this review which one ID4 went for!

Independence Day was the summer blockbuster,  it was hyped into us that 
it  would be so..  I'm quite pleased that my 14 year old cousin was  in 
town  that week as I had been appointed official cinema taker  to  keep 
him happy in the evenings and so we went do see this one.. 

Fast forward through the grotty commercials later, and here we go..

It  starts  off calmly enough,  the initial disbelief is conveyed  well 
enough,  and  the looming presence of the alien fleet hinted at and not 
shoved  in  our  face  until later  on..  Initial  impressions  are  of 
confusion and disbelief until the giant fifteen mile ships are  hanging 
over  cities  in  the way that bricks don't..  We get quite  a  lot  of 
double-takes at this point in the film..

In  spite  of  one notable early accident with an AWACS  plane,  it  is 
assumed that the aliens are benevolent,  until Jeff Goldblum,  like the 
good hacker he is,  susses out their notso nice intentions.. Rushing to 
the White House,  he manages to convince the President, a sort of cheap 
Michael Douglas lookalike,  of the dodginess of the situation,  without 
really providing a proper explanation to him,  or us, and without being 
shown the pavement by ever keen security staff..  But why pick holes in 
the plot, eh!

Il  Presidente  manages to swallow the story whole,  to the  extent  of 
letting Jeff,  and his Jewish caricature comedy cameo dad onto Airforce 
One, just as the assumed benevolence mindset is unravelling in the face 
of high energy particle beams levelling Washington.. A good many people 
came  to  the cinema with a glint in their eye just to  see  the  White 
House explode into tiny wee pieces..  At about the same time one of the 
best  throwaway lines is delivered as a UFO nut on the roof of an  L.A. 
Skyscraper,  directly under an alien ship's belly declaims "I hope they 
bring  back Elvis!" Unfortunately,  they are among the first victims of 
the alien shit hitting the fan..

The  first stage of Earth's retaliation falls over in the face of  damn 
tricky alien technology,  until the other central hero ( correct ethnic 
mix  balance  Black fighter pilot) manages to outfly one of  the  alien 
suckers  and  crash  him  into the  Grand  Canyon..  They  both  become 
unwilling hitchhikers, the Alien unconcious and dragged in a parachute, 
until they both end up at the top secret UFO base, Area 51.. 

(Interesting ID4 fact,  the US armed forces quite liked the idea of the 
film as it showed them in a positive light,  a bit like 'Top Gun',  and 
were  going to extend their full co-operation..  The one change to  the 
script they suggested,  was a deletion of all references to 'Area 51'.. 
The producers refused to do this, and the US military withdrew from the 
production! - The Truth is out there??)

This  turns out to contain the infamous 'Rosewell' ship,  a  scoutcraft 
partially  reconstrusted,  and  also  Brent Spiner as  the  mad  hippie 
scientist  in  charge of the investigation (otherwise better  known  as 
'Data',  the  android  in  STNG) This becomes very  important  as  Jeff 
manages  to come up with an alien defence busting computer  virus,  and 
needs  the  services of the other central character to fly him  to  the 
very big Alien mothership, in orbit near the moon.. 

Half  a dozen brutally ignored by me sub-plots later,  the main mission 
goes well,  humanity is saved, and a final titanic series of *very* big 
explosions marks the end of the alien threat.. Huzzah!!

Why did I feel unmoved??

The  film I was expecting was going to have more of a thriller  element 
to it, be a little bit scarey perhaps.. This one went for uneasy comedy 
and cornball patriotic speeches that mistook the rest of the world  for 
a  suburb  of  the United States..  The best films have some  basis  in 
reality,  where you can place yourself in that situation.. ID4 just did 
not have that quality..

(About  destroying  the motherships:- I can't work out  how  they  were 
going to bring down a fifteen mile wide object with the relatively tiny 
air-to-air  dogfighting missiles the Earth forces were firing..  A  bit 
like trying to demolish an office block by firing rifle calibre bullets 
at  it..  Surely a case for something much bigger,  but a tactical nuke 
wouldn't  have  had the same heroic self sacrifice of the  drunken  ex-
Vietnam  crop  duster  who  kamikazied  himself  into  the  death   ray 
mechanism..  The  film  end bit would have been quite a bit shorter  as 
well..)

I  enjoyed it,  but they left out the suspense as there wasn't any room 
for it after all the explosions had been squeezed in, so I didn't enjoy 
it quite as much as I thought I was going to..
