        -BEVERLY AND DEANNA - 
          -A TREK LOVE STORY-
                By Ann Douglas
                        (AnnD@Pipeline.Com)
                   -Part One-





        ".......and Ensign Murphy continues to show 
improvement following reconstruction of both his 
right tibia and fibula.........Crusher, Chief Medical 
Officer...U.S.S. Enterprise."
        Beverly Crusher eased back into the  soft 
padded chair behind her desk as the computer shut 
off her medi-recorder.  Medical science may have 
advanced to the semblance of magic in the last few 
hundred years, but that arch enemy of all physicians  
- paperwork still remained -- even if it now resided 
on a computer disk.
        She leaned back in the chair and closed her 
eyes, only to be interrupted by the beep of her 
office's door chime.
        "Enter,"  She said, rubbing her sore eyes.
        "I thought I'd fine you here, your nose buried 
in the medical reports."  Said the dark haired woman 
who entered the room. "I thought you promised me 
that you'd slow down a little and take some time 
off."
        Beverly smiled as she focused on the sight of 
ship's counselor, Deanna Troi.  
        "I'm glad to se you Deanna, "  Beverly said, 
"It gives me an excuse to take a  break."
        "You need more than a break,"  Deanna said 
as she walked across  the room and sat down across 
from Crusher's desk. "I've already spoken to the 
Captain and as of now, you're on 48 hours of R & 
R."
        "Deanna, really....."  Beverly interrupted. 
"I've way too much work to catch up on here."
        "No arguments, "  Troi countered, "As of 
now Dr. Selar is taking your place as acting CMO, 
and you are on leave."
        "Seems like I  don't really have a say in the 
matter,"  Beverly smiled. Deep inside she knew she 
could really use the rest. "I guess you already have 
my little vacation already planned out for me."
        "As a matter of fact  I do,"  The Betazoid 
said.  "You're going to love the spot I've got picked 
out.  Beautiful blue 
sky, soft green grass,  magnificent waterfalls."
        "Not another holodeck adventure?"  the 
Doctor said, remembering similar vacations in the 
past.
        "No, not this time,"  Deanna replied. "If we 
used the holodeck you'd cut it short and be running 
back here at the first medical emergency."
        "Then where......?"
        "Trust me, you're going to love it."  Troi said 
with a wide smile.  "Now get packed and meet me in 
the shuttle bay in an hour."
        "Meet you?"
        "Didn't I tell you, I'm going with you." 
Deanna said, her smile growing wider.



        An hour and fifteen minutes later, Deanna 
and Beverly were sailing through the void in the 
shuttle, Christopher Pike. Beverly had replaced her 
normal blue medical smock with a short sleeve white 
blouse and green skirt.  A pair of white shorts and 
light blue top had replaced Troi's jumpsuit.
        "You still haven't told me where we are 
going?"  Beverly said.
        "Gamma Hydra IV,"   Deanna said as she 
worked the shuttle  controls.  "It's a small M class 
world about four light hours away, so sit back and 
enjoy the ride."
        For the first time she leaving the Enterprise, 
Beverly sat back and felt some of the weight lift 
from her.  It'd been such a busy month, she was glad 
to be taking a break.  She was also glad she had a 
friend in Deanna who recognized the strain on her 
and forced her to take a rest.
        
        The four hours passed quickly and soon the 
blue-white image of  Gamma Hydra IV filled the 
viewport.  With a practiced hand, the two women 
put the shuttle down on at the location,  Deanna had 
marked on the astrogator.  Fresh air filled the 
cabin  as the back door of the ship dropped and
Deanna  turned in her seat and with a flourish of her
hand ,  indicated for the Doctor to precede her. 
        Beverly was taken aback by the natural 
beauty of the planet as she stepped out of the
shuttle.  Deanna's description couldn't compare with
the majesty before her.  She stood there speechless
as Deanna followed  her out onto the glass.
        "Welcome to Beverly's World"  Troi said as 
she stretched out her arms. 
        "Beverly's World, huh."  the Doctor said in 
amusement.
        "Well at least for the next forty hours or so."
Deanna replied.  "Total population - 2."
        "Well since that eliminates the possibility of a 
dozen strong young men to unload the shuttle,"
Beverly said laughingly, "I guess we'd better get to 
it."


        It took less than an hour to set up camp.
Deanna had chosen their landing site perfectly.  A 
thousand yards away stood a crystal clear lake, fed 
by one of the most magnificent waterfalls Beverly 
had ever seen.  Putting the camp by the waters edge, 
Deanna quickly suggested they take a swim before  
dinner.
        "It'll just take me a minute to get my suit, 
Beverly said as she reached for one of her bags."
        "Don't bother," Deanna said as she pulled her 
top over her head, exposing a large pair of firm 
breasts. "We're the only ones here after all."
        Beverly hesitated for a moment.  Nudity was 
second nature for the Betazoid, many of her cultures 
official functions such as weddings and funerals 
were performed in the nude.  As a Doctor,  Beverly 
didn't give nudity a second thought in a medical 
situation, but old habits made her hesitate outside of 
 that.  Realizing she was being silly, Beverly
followed  Troi's example and quickly  rid herself  of
clothes.  
        Looking at her body she knew she didn't 
have anything to be self-conscious about.  True she 
didn't have Deanna's spectacular figure, but for a 
woman her age she had no complaints.   Trying her 
red hair into a ponytail, she joined the Counselor in 
the cool water.
        The water felt good on her bare skin and 
soon she wondered why she had even thought about 
it.  Deanna splashed and tossed water at her like a 
little girl and Beverly quickly found herself returning 
the same.
        Deanna moved up to Beverly and wrapped 
her arms around her and gave her a big hug.
        "I missed you so much the year you spent at 
Starfleet Medical, I'm so glad you came back."
        Beverly returned the embrace, thinking that 
she had missed the dark haired woman as well.
        Dripping wet, they exited the lake and dried 
them self.  As Troi made no effort to reach for her 
clothes, Beverly left hers where she had dropped 
them,  no longer feeling self-conscious.
        "I've got a surprise for you,"  Deanna said as 
she reached into a refrigerated case and produced a 
chilled bottle.  "Altarian Apple Wine."  
        "Where in the galaxy did you get a bottle of 
that?"  Beverly exclaimed.  "I haven't had that since I 
was in medical school."
        "Well there are some advantages to being a 
Daughter of the Fifth House, someday Holder of the 
Sacred Chalice of Rix and Heir to the Holy Rings of 
Betazed."  Deanna replied as she produced two pure 
crystal wine glasses.
        "So in other words you asked your mother 
and she got it for you."
        "True,"  Deanna said laughingly.  "but if that 
bothers you I can always drink it by myself."
        "No, I don't care if you got it from a fat 
Ferengi, I'll just keep it in mind the next time I want 
to scream in frustration at  Lwaxana."
        "She does have that effect on people, doesn't 
she."  said Deanna as she poured the two glasses and 
handed Beverly one.
        "Mmmmm,"  Beverly murmured as she
tasted it.  "Its been so long I'd forgotten how 
delicious it tastes.  You can't replaced wine like this 
with snythehol."
        A second later Beverly remembered the
strength of the wine as she felt her body suddenly fill 
with a warm flush.Altarian apple wine was also used
as an aphrodisiac,  one that Beverly had found
herself highly susceptible  to that last time she had it.
        "It does have a kick to it,"  Deanna said as 
she sipped hers. 

        "I'd forgotten how much."  Beverly answered 
as she took another drink.  After all she was on 
leave and supposed to enjoy herself.
        Deanna picked up the bottle and sat down 
next to Beverly, refilling the contents of her glass.
Beverly could feel the heat of the Counselor's body 
and didn't need to be a doctor to knew it had grown
as hot as hers.

        "The breeze feels wonderful,"  Beverly 
remarked as she tossed her long red hair.  "So far 
from the pressures of sickbay."
        Deanna just smiled.
        "It's been so hard since Wesley left for 
Starfleet Academy,"  Beverly continued, "It seems 
like I never have time for anything but work.  At 
least when he was onboard I always set aside time to 
be with him."
        "Still you must be very proud of him."
Deanna said, sipping at her wine.
        "Yes I am, but it was still very hard to say 
good-bye to him that day, even with everyone else 
there, Data, Will, Geordie, Jean-Luc........"
        Beverly paused for a second ,  remembering 
something.      
        "But you weren't there, strange that I didn't 
remember that before.  You'd have thought I would 
recall something like that."
        "Well you were pretty preoccupied that 
morning..."
        "Wesley never mentioned it either, now I 
know that he definitely would notice."  Beverly said, 
recalling her son's sometimes lustful looks at the 
counselor.
        "Well.......Wesley and I said our good-byes 
the night before...."  Troi said softly.
        "The night before......You mean you and 
Wesley....."
        "It was sort of a good-bye gift. It didn't start 
out that way, but when he tried, it seemed so 
important to him.  I hope you're not upset."
        Beverly paused for a moment, taking another 
drink of the wine.  "No, its ok, he's a big boy."
        "It's a relief to hear you say that, I wouldn't 
want anything to come between us."
        

        Both women were silent for a few seconds 
until Beverly asked.....
        "Was he any good?"
        Troi nearly dropped her glass in surprise.
        "I can't believe I asked  that...."  Beverly said 
blushing.
        "Do you really want me to answer?"
        "I don't know if its a Mother's curiosity or 
the wine, but yes."
        "Well ....  he was about as good as you 
would expect of a boy that age....but he was very 
eager to learn.  In fact I can guarantee that some 
girls at Starfleet Academy are going to be 
the  grateful recipients of what he so eagerly
learned."
        
        Beverly felt another warm flush cross her 
body.  The wine, both hers and Troi's nudity, the 
discussion of her son's sexuality, their isolation on 
this distant world, all were having an effect on her. 
She found herself entertaining thoughts that she 
once would've found shocking.
        "I've always envied you Deanna,"  Beverly 
said as she put down the now empty glass. "The way 
you can be so free and open.  How you could just 
follow your feelings."
        "You could be the same way, Beverly."  All 
you have to do is act on those feelings."
        "I could never do that, I'd be too worried 
about what all those people around me would 
think."
        "Well I don't see anyone around here
now.....do you?" Troi asked as she placed her glass 
down next to Beverly's.  "After all, this is Beverly's 
World, where her every wish can come true."     
        
        Beverly Crusher, Chief Medical Officer of 
the Federation Starship Enterprise thought about it
for a few minutes.  Then she took all the elements of 
her life, wrapped them into a little package, and 
tossed them aside.
        The red haired woman then leaned forward 
and kissed Deanna.
        The Betazoid quickly responded to the kiss, 
gently at first, gently brushing her cheek, then her 
lips, then harder as her tongue sought out Beverly's. 
Fire raced through her body as she felt Beverly's 
tongue caress her own, then she backed off, 
nibbled  on her lips, then drove her tongue even
deeper into  her new lover's open mouth. 
        For long minutes the two exchanged
tongues, striving to drive them deeper with each 
new kiss, tasting the sweetness of each other.
Deanna then broke away and began to trail kisses 
down Beverly's neck, up behind her ears, then down 
to her shoulders.  Beverly arched her head back to  
give Deanna greater access, closing her eyes and 
savoring the touch of the younger woman's tongue.
        While she continued to lick the Doctor's 
shoulder, Deanna reached down and cupped 
Beverly's smaller breasts, squeezing them softly.
Then she moved her hands to again  caress 
Beverly's  face, kissing her again and again.
        "I love you Beverly...."  Deanna said as she 
kissed her once again.  "I've loved you for the 
longest time."
        "I think I've always loved you too, Deanna,"
Beverly replied.  "I think I was always just too 
scared to do anything about it."
        Deanna eased the older woman down onto 
the grass.  Her mouth now sought out the Doctor's 
breasts and began to suck on them.  Her roving 
tongue covering  them with wetness.  Beverly  
shivered at the touch of Deanna's lips on her smooth 
flesh as her tongue teased Beverly's large  nipples. 
Each lick bringing them to a new hardness.  Then 
her lips closed on them and every bite and nibble 
sent waves through  Beverly,  causing her to emit 
soft moans.  Moans which brought great joy to  
Deanna. 
        Deanna reached down between Beverly's
legs and traced the outline of her red haired mound 
with her finger.  Then it moved to the center of the 
mound and rubbed against it.  As her finger became 
lubricated by the wetness there, she slowing slid it 
between the folds.  A soft gasp escaped Beverly's 
lips as Troi slid the finger in and out, soon following 
it with a second.
        Deanna licked each nipple a final time and 
them moved her head down Beverly's stomach, 
pausing to kiss and lick her way.  Lower and lower 
she kissed her way until she reached the edge 
of  Beverly's wetness.  The Counselor then kissed
one  thigh, then the other.  Finally she kissed the
center of  Beverly's ecstasy.
        "Oh yes....Beverly said as she reached down 
and guided Troi's head.  "It feels so good...."
        The smell of Beverly's crotch made Deanna 
lightheaded, she'd waited so long for this.  She 
reached out and parted the wet lips with her fingers, 
moving her tongue between them, driving it deep 
inside.  She closed her eyes as she savored the taste, 
 a taste she knew no other woman had ever known.  
        "Oh God, Deanna,"  Beverly said as her body 
jumped at the touch. "I never knew it could feel so 
wonderful."
        Encouraged, Deanna moved her pulsating 
mouth closer and sought out Beverly's clit.  She 
alternated between her finger and her tongue, 
driving Beverly wilder with each stroke.  A 
rhythm  quickly developed as Beverly reached down
and  held the Counselor's head between her legs,
then  lurched forward with each movement of her
lover's  tongue.
        Unable to use her hands any longer, Deanna 
reached behind and grabbed Beverly's ass cheeks.
Never missing a beat, she slid a cum lubricated 
finger into her anus. Beverly let out a loud 
moan as  she felt it penetrate, no one had ever tried
than with  her before. Then Deanna withdrew the
finger and  reinserted it, finger fucking her ass.
        Beverly began to gyrate faster as she felt 
herself nearing climax.  Deanna could taste the 
increase in girlcum and opened her mouth while at 
the same time  she drove it deeper.
        The Betaziod was soon rewarded with a
gusher of girlcum, so much that her face was soon 
covered with it.  She held Beverly tight as the 
Doctor screamed out loud and trashed about it 
ecstasy.  It had been a long time since 
she'd had  sexual release other than masturbation.
        Deanna continued to lick Beverly's pussy and 
finger fuck her ass, stopping only when her lover 
finally laid still. She then withdrew her finger but
continued to lick  between her legs, but softly now,
taking the time to  clean her thighs of delicious
girlcum.
        "That was wonderful."  Beverly said in a 
breathless voice.  "I feel so alive....so exhilarated."
        "I'm glad," Deanna said as she brought 
herself  up to a sitting position.  "I've wanted to do 
that for so very long."
        Beverly reached out and pulled Deanna close 
to her.  She kissed her, tasting her own cum in 
Deanna's mouth.  She found it intoxicating.  She 
continued to kiss her for several minutes, licking 
droplets of sweet girljuice from her face.
        "I want you Deanna,"  She whispered as she 
sucked at the Counselor's earlobe.  "I want to taste 
you and make you feel as wonderful as you've made 
me feel."
        "I love you, Beverly,"  Troi whispered back, 
"My body is yours, take it as my gift to you."
        Beverly drew her close and wrapped her 
arms around her.  Troi cuddled up against Beverly's 
breasts and closed her eyes in contentment.   For 
now they both wanted just to hold each other 
.....tomorrow would be soon enough to start again.


        The soft glow of warm sunlight woke
Deanna as she stretched naked on the gentle grass. Her
sleep had been filled with dreams of Beverly.  A  smile filled
her face as she thought of their  lovemaking last night. 
Realizing that her new found  love was no where to be seen,
she reached out  empathically --  quickly finding Beverly in
the  shuttle.  The fire of Beverly's love was like a candle  in
the darkness.
        "Beverly...."  She called out as she rose to  her feet.
        "Be out in a minute..."  came the reply. "There's
breakfast already made."
        Deanna sat at the small table Beverly had set  up and
tasted the small  fruit treats.  As she put the  first sliced
piece in her mouth she was shocked and  pleased to find it
had a most original and particular  taste.  They tasted of
Beverly - the same taste she  had so enjoyed last night.
        Popping another morsel into her mouth, she  didn't
notice Beverly come up from behind her.  The  Doctor
reached up from behind and cupped the  Counselor's large
breasts, then began kissing the  back of her neck.
        "Good Morning, Deanna...."  Beverly purred  as she
tweaked the Betazoid's large nipples.  "I hope  you like the
breakfast."
        "Interesting  recipe, I'm not even going to  ask how
you managed to make these."
        In response, Beverly reached out and pulled 
Deanna's face to hers.  She kissed her, again tasting  herself
on Deanna's tongue. A second kiss followed,  then a third. 
In her hands she could feel Deanna's  nipples hardening.
        "Why don't we skip breakfast and go right to 
desert?" Deanna said between kisses.
        "I was hoping you'd say that."  Beverly  grinned. 

        Lifting Deanna out of the chair, Beverly bent  down
and kissed each of the breasts.  Since  becoming a doctor,
Beverly had seen literally  thousands of naked women, but
she had never see a  pair of breasts as perfectly sculptured
as these.  They  cried out to be touched...to be caressed....to
be  sucked.  Dropping to her knees, she closed her  mouth
on the right nipple and took it into her  mouth.  She caught
it between her teeth and bit  down, just enough to send a
small jolt of pleasure  through Deanna.  The she opened her
mouth and  released it.  The she stuck out her tongue and
gently  licked it to full hardness.  Then she turned her 
attention to the left breast which she had been  massaging
with her hand.
        "You tongue is electric..."  Deanna signed as  she
leaned back and supported herself against the  chair.
        Once the other nipple was just as hard,  Beverly
moved back and forth from breast to breast,  sucking with
abandon.  Deanna ran her hands  through Beverly's red hair
and pulled her mouth  against each breast, encouraging the 
older woman  to take more of it into her mouth.  
        Beverly needed  no encouragement as she  mouthed
Deanna's tits, covering each with hot  saliva. She alternated
between licks and bites,  causing small, sudden jolts of both
pain and  pleasure.  
        Reaching down between Deanna's legs, Beverly
rubbed two fingers against the dark haired  mound.  
Finding it already wet, she slipped first one,  then a second 
finger inside, all the while never  diverting her attention 
from that  magnificent bosom.  Soon both fingers were
buried up beyond  her knuckles and covered with lubricating
girljuice.  In addition to quickening the pace, Beverly
slipped  in a third finger.
        Deanna moaned in delight as she abandoned  control
of her body.  Whatever Beverly wanted...she  would do.
        After a few more minutes, Beverly withdrew  the
three fingers and began massaging her clit with  her thumb
as she slid first one, then two, and finally  all three cum
soaked fingers into her asshole. Deanna jumped with the
sudden new intrusion. Betazoids were far more sensitive in
that area than  humans, so the gesture was far more erotic. 
Beverly  planned to use every bit of her knowledge of 
Betazoid physiology to bring Deanna pleasure.
        Beverly's mouth soon replaced her thumb on  the
Counselor's clit, taking it into her mouth and  sucking it as
hard as she could.  Deanna bucked  back and forth with the
motion of Beverly's mouth  and fingers.  She could feel the
eruption building  within her.
        Beverly licked the drops of precum off  Deanna's
cunt, she had never tasted anything so  sweet.  Her tongue
drove deep inside, scooping up  the ambrosia and
withdrawing it into her mouth. She could feel the energy
building inside Deanna's  body, but she didn't want her to
cum too soon.  Not  until she gave her surprise.
        Beverly then began to alternate her tongue  between
Deanna's  pussy and her asshole, driving her  to a more
maddening frenzy, yet at the same time  slowing down her
orgasmic buildup.
        Another advantage Beverly had as the Ship's  Chief
Medical Officer was that where Deanna may  have been
Counselor for the rest of the crew, the  Doctor had been the
Councilor's Councilor.  As such  she knew all the right
buttons to push.  She knew  that what Deanna secretly
craved in a lover was  someone she could surrender herself
to.  Someone  who would possess her body and soul.
        "Oh God....Beverly.....I'm going to cum....." Deanna
 gasped between breaths.
        "Not yet,"  the Doctor shot back loudly.
        "Please.....I need to cum..."  
        "I said no!"  Beverly said in a loud
authoritative voice.  
        Surprising the Counselor meekly assented, 
confirming the Doctor's diagnosis.  
        Sure of her next move, Beverly slowly rose  and
licked her way up to Deanna's mouth.  Now her  kisses were
harder, her bites drawing a more than a  touch of pain. Deep
inside, Deanna shuddered even  more as she surrendered her
self totally.
        "I have a gift for you."  Beverly said as she  took a
step back and lifted a blue carry bag she had  brought from
out of the shuttle.  "A little something I made in the
replicator this morning."
        
        Deanna's eyes opened wide as Beverly
reached into the bad and withdrew her "gift".  In her  hand
she held a large nine inch strap on dildo,  complete with
balls and realistic veins.  
        "Its too big..."  Deanna exclaimed.
        "No its not,"  Beverly said as she slipped it  on and
adjusted the straps.  "You forget I've  examined Will Riker
many times....I know what  you're capable of taking!"
        With that she took hold of Deanna and
spread her over the table.  Moving behind her, she  spread
her legs and positioned the hard rubber cock  at the entrance
of her dripping cunt.  Deanna gasped  as it filled her, inch by 

inch.
        After in was half way in, Beverly withdrew it 
slightly, then with a firm grip on Deanna's asscheeks, 
thrusted forward and filled her with her "cock".
        "God!" Deanna  screamed.  "Oh God,
....Yes...Yes...Fuck me......Fuck my pussy!"
        Fast as she could, Beverly fucked her friend  as she
screamed again and again for her to do to  harder.  Gone
was the cool, in control Counselor. All that remained was a
sex hungry slut who wanted  nothing more than to be
fucked without mercy.
        With every stroke, Beverly drove deeper, as  Deanna
reached down and massaged her pussy.  She  was now
beyond words,  nothing existed except her  hot cunt and the
girlcock driving deeper and deeper  inside it.
        Sweat covered both their naked bodies as  Beverly
put every ounce of energy into giving  Deanna the greatest
orgasm of her life.  Each thrust  sent Deanna further into
ectasty, her vision blurred  as an engulfing wave ripped
through her beautiful  body.  She shook and trembled,
unable to breath. A  second, then a third wave radiated from
the center  of her womanhood, the least of which was
greater  than she had felt from Riker or any man.  
        The fourth wave was too much for her and 
consciousness slipped from her as she collapsed onto  the
table.  Beverly quickly withdrew from her and  checked her
vital signs.  A warm smile covered the  Doctor's face as she
found a good steady heartbeat. For a second she feared she
might 've gone too far. Reaching down she lifted her friend
and eased her  onto the soft grass.
        "Bev.......Beverly...."  Deanna whispered as  she
opened her eyes.  "I can't believe....  how....powerful...that
was."
        "Shhhh, my little love,"  Beverly said as she  stroked
her dark hair.  "Take a little while and rest"
        "But there's so much I want to tell you..." Deanna
said in feeble protest.
        "Plenty of time for that later....."
        "But....."
        "Rest I said......"  Beverly repeated as she  caressed
her lover's cheek......"Doctor's orders." she  added with a 
mischievous grin.
