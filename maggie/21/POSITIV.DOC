PRESS RELEASE                                        20th August 1996
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
POSITIVE IMAGE V1.1 OUT NOW
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Things may have  been  a  little  quiet  on  the  Positive Image front
recently, but there's good reason  for  this.  We've been hard at work
improving the package  still  further,  reaching  towards  our goal of
producing the most powerful  image  processing  and retouching package
for Atari computers.

The initial release achieved all of the  above and more but, lets face
it, it was a bit on  the  slow  side.  Although  we all love our Atari
machines, they are not exactly  the  fastest  by today's standards and
image processing is undoubtedly  processor  intensive, so the downside
was the speed at which  things  happened,  mostly in the screen redraw
and printing departments. Some competing  packages  were faster on the
redraws (none offered printing directly so  that was not an issue) but
they paled into insignificance  when  compared  feature  by feature to
Positive  Image.  They  concentrated  on  speed,  we  concentrated  on
features, you can't have both....or can you?

Well it appears that you  can,  within  limits.  Here at Floppyshop we
have gone back to the  drawing  board  to  squeeze every last ounce of
power out of your 68x00 chip and  the results are plain to see. Screen
redraws are around 40%  faster  in  256  colour  modes  for a complete
redraw. More importantly, in  v1.1  the  tiling works 'intelligently',
redrawing only the tiles where  changes  have  been  made. There is no
reliable way to measure this  increase  as  v1.0  used to walk through
each and every tile, the larger  the  image  the longer this took. Now
(after the initial load  and  draw)  ALL  subsequent  redraws are near
instantaneous with only UNDO or  APPLY  MASK ever requiring the entire
screen to be redrawn (for obvious  reasons).  The amount of time saved
when editing any image is enormous!

Another area which  has  received  a  major  upgrade  is the printing.
Without affecting the quality (which was  always superior to any other
printing package on the  market),  output  speed  has been improved so
that it is now on average 335%  faster  (not a misprint, it takes less
than 1/3rd of the time v1.0 took!)  at  outputting an A4 size image to
monochrome printers  and  about  35%  faster  at  printing  to  colour
printers.

A new feature of the upgrade  is  support for multiple masks active on
the same image. This requires  a  little  explanation.  In v1.0 it was
possible to define any region  within  an  image  and create or load a
mask to be previewed for that  area.  Assuming you were happy with the
result, it was  a  simple  case  of  applying  the  mask  in  order to
permanently integrate it into  your  image.  If  you  defined a second
region (before applying) and created/loaded  a  mask for it, the first
region would be lost. In v1.1  you  define  a region, load or create a
mask then  (without  applying)  define  a  new  area  and  repeat  the
procedure. The result is that  (although  the block definition for the
first region is removed) the original masked area remains intact along
with your new  definition.  Repeat  this  as  required.  When you have
finished with masking,  select  APPLY  MASK  and  all  defined regions
within the image will have  their preview masks permanently integrated
into the image in a single operation.  This  is a great time saver and
adds considerably to  the  functionality  of  Positive Image's masking
capabilities.

Amongst the most notable of the  miscellaneous  speed ups is the trace
area tool (commonly known as the Magic Wand in several other packages)
which now auto  traces  areas  (subject  to  a  user defined tolerance
level) at  around  three  times  its  previous  speed.  Invaluable for
selecting/eliminating  specific  areas  of  background  or  foreground
within an image. Its  editable  partner,  the  bezier  tool,  is a bit
faster than before but more  importantly,  it  is now pixel precise in
its selecting of control  points  and  editing  of  curves even at the
highest zoom level.

Finally,  we   have   fixed   the   filtering   bug   which  prevented
images/regions within images from  being  filtered  right  up to their
edges! Lots of other minor bugs  have  been eliminated (we didn't have
any major ones) and the functionality of certain minor elements within
the program has changed, all in the name of progress!

PRICING
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
We decided to hold Positive Image at its launch price until v1.1 was
released. As this has now happened, we  reserve the right to revert to
full RRP of 79 pounds at any time. Having said that, the current price
remains at 65 pounds + P&P  (2  pounds  UK, 5 pounds Europe, 10 pounds
rest of world). UK customers can pay by cheque, Postal Order or Credit
Card  (except  Switch).  Overseas  customers  should  order  from  our
distributor in their country (  list  follows).  If  we  do not have a
distributor they can of  course  order  direct from Floppyshop. Please
note that when ordering from  Floppyshop,  payment  must be made in UK
pounds sterling. The easiest way is to pay by credit card, but we also
accept Eurocheques, International Money Orders  and Post Giros (in all
cases they must be made out  in  UK  pounds  sterling)  or by way of a
cheque drawn on a UK bank.

UPGRADING
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Those of you who have already purchased Positive Image will be pleased
to know that you can  upgrade  by  returning  your master disks (disks
only, not the whole package!) along with the upgrade fee of 5 pounds +
P&P (UK & Europe  œ1,  rest  of  world  2  pounds). Customers in North
America should contact  Computer  Direct  (support@compdirect.com) for
details of how to upgrade their copies.

NEW DEMO VERSION
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
For those of you who have not yet purchased Positive Image, a new demo
of the latest upgrade  (v1.1)  is  now  available for downloading. The
demo on the ST Format cover  disk  and  on most ftp sites is pre-v1.0,
although it says v1.0 on the info  box.  It is VERY old and you should
not  waste  time  downloading  it!  Instead,  the  latest  version  is
available by anonymous ftp from Wintermute. Here's how to get it:-

ftp ftp.wintermute.co.uk

log in as ftp, give your email address as your password, then type the
following two lines.

cd home/s/steil/outgoing/
get pi_demo.zip
