Part umpteen in a regular column..
Almost before we got the last one out of the way,  we're into a new one, 
with some more news and hopefully some more reviews as well..

Of  the first,  several developments of interest..  We should be getting 
the  final  issue of ST News any day now,  another well established  and 
famous  publication may well have died,  a new Scottish one started  up, 
and one thought long dead will be relaunched onto an unsuspecting  world 
shortly..

"But what?" you cry..  Patience dear, don't be so greedy, as all will be 
revealed shortly..

In the meantime, the first of our reviews, the latest new mag to come to 
our fingertips..

                            Kelstar issue 4

This  magazine seems to have started life as the spawn of Bob Kell,  and 
regarded with some controversy and distaste by ST Format..  The magazine 
attracted  one  of  'Format's less flattering  reviews,  including  some 
unhappiness with the 'adult' theme that the mag was using..

Having some sympathy with them, and remembering the early days of Maggie 
when  many of the same criticisms were applied to us,  I decided to  see 
for myself.. 

Kelstar is done competently enough..  The well-worn TOMS shell comes out 
to  play  again,.  albeit the super swish solid menu bar green  edition, 
with  a  customisable cover picture of sorts on the main screen  of  the 
mag.. It is possible to get to the accessories from the menu, so you can 
have your choice of background modfile player,  and choice of tunes from 
those embedded on your hard drive..  Other menu bars lead to the various 
articles,   according  to  STF,  the  really  shuddersome  bit  of  this 
publication..

Firstly  with regard to the alleged naughtiness..  This consists of just 
one  or two jokes columns of fairly tame and smutty adult  jokes,  which 
could be put into a hidden article,  or quietly dropped and no-one would 
be any the wiser.. However, these do not come anywhere near the infamous 
Delta Force issue 10 of Maggie which featured quite a lot of erm, *very* 
'adult'  material..  A  fairly marginal point as I personally feel  that 
this  mag  could  be  read by anyone from  early  teens  upwards..  They 
probably know much ruder jokes by then!

The  next major criticism that STF had of the mag was that a lot of  the 
mag was made up of internet 'borrowed' files..  Quite true in the humour 
section,  where a lot of material may have had online origins.. At least 
one  very  good article was included from the 'Power' diskmag  with  the 
blessing  of James Mathews..  No reasonable person can object to careful 
use  of internet grabbed files,  and I personally feel that the articles 
were  reasonably in proportion and well chosen for this issue,  although 
original material is always preferable.. 

There  is  quite  a bit of original material to balance  this,  as  some 
personal  writing by Bob Kell and other people comes into the  picture.. 
On  considering  some  earlier  issues as well,  Bob  Kell  brings  back 
memories of some of the more 'personal' writings of John Weller of  STEN 
with  his observations on the absurdities of life in general..  It is  a 
job that he has enthusiasm for and does well, and is a major strength of 
the  mag..  Anyway,  none of the glossy mags ever had a bad thing to say 
about STEN when it was around! 

A  good 'forum' section allows other contributors to address  topics  of 
their  own  choice,   computing  or  non-computing  alike..  I  get  the 
impression  that a lot of former supporters of the sadly  missed  'Power 
Diskmag' have collected here in a sort of cheerleader role as many half-
forgotten names bob into view on these pages..

Another  aspect to the 'personalisation' of Kelstar comes with Ron,  the 
mad Scots Nationalist,  who sounds off like a tartan clad version of Alf 
Garnett, and even has his own letters column where he rubbishes opposing 
points  of  view  with weak and specious arguments..  The same  sort  of 
entertainment  value that bear baiting or public executions  might  have 
once had for our distant ancestors..

Where there might be a valid weak point,  is in the reviews section,  or 
rather, lack thereof..

A tiny selection of lesser PD releases really shows what a poor state of 
health  parts  of  the ST community are in..  This is fleshed  out  with 
reviews  on other topics,  a fledgling 'multimedia' section going to the 
cinema etc, other slightly more technical writings about different types 
of  monitors..  None  of  these are very large  or  descriptive  reviews 
either,  and  if  work  to improve on the content of Kelstar  is  really 
needed, it is here where Bob should start..

Some  other  writings about computer and related topics in  a  technical 
section do go some way to making up for the lack of reviews,  as we find 
out  a  bit  more about the 'Nemesis'  Falcon  accelerator  among  other 
things..

This mag is currently bi-monthly,  but set to go monthly from the 1st of 
September.. It will be interesting to see what happens now..

Summary:- Bi-monthly, going to monthly release, standard D/S disk.. TOMS 
shell  (late edition),  but compatible with Falcon (and other members of 
ST  family  too?)  Articles a mix of the good,  the  passable,  and  the 
indifferent..  A bit low on decent reviews..  Prospects, uncertain, they 
really need more decent writers,  especially to substain a monthly mag.. 
Only time will tell how well they do..

Overall,  Six  and a half out of ten,  not as black as ST Format painted 
it!!


                      ST-News 11.1 (Final Issue!) 

It is with some apprehension that I sit down to write this review..  ST-
News  has been a major part of the diskmag scene,  indeed the Big Kahuna 
on  the beach,  almost since there were ST's being sold..  Their funeral 
rites  in  this final issue really do mean the end of an era as  far  as 
everyone  still computing in the Atari sense of the word is  concerned.. 
How  can you be totally objective and review the thing,  when a pagefull 
of tributes would really fit the bill instead..

We must do our best however..

ST News 11.1 is a whopper of an issue, containing both issues 41 and 42, 
the latter number being significant to Richard Karsmakers in a number of 
different  ways,  explained  in  more detail inside the mag..  It  comes 
initially in two parts,  .ZIPfiles of 800-odd kilobytes each,  and it is 
apparent that very basic ST type hardware will no longer do.. It can run 
on any Atari TOS series xxx machine,  no doubt,  but a hard drive, or at 
the very least,  a High Density floppy drive,  will be needed.. (Someone 
with  neither of the above but a lot of memory might try assembling  the 
mag within a Ramdisk? - Bit of a pain to have to reassemble it each time 
you want to look at it though?)  

Installation  is  a  breeze though,  and once this is  done,  a  perfect 
working copy of ST News 11.1 is ready to run on my hard disk..

Clicking on the .PRG file brings up the familiar blue background,  and a 
couple of dialogue boxes later, you are into the main mag.. The music is 
set  'off',  presumably to avoid problems with PC emulators or  MagicMac 
and suchlike.. A quick dabble with the options menu brings Big Alec onto 
the scene with a blummin' good and never before heard SID-type soundchip 
tune  (which inevitably stales after a dozen or so repetitions,  so  you 
turn  it off again..) The shell is the same as in issues past,  and runs 
very slickly from hard drive. Not a lot more needs to be said there..

As  you  might expect,  the content is huge,  with the GFA 'pretend GEM' 
Hyper-menu system,  extended as fully as it can go in places..  Starting 
with  the left hand side,  a lot of articles along the lines of 'So this 
is the final issue of ST News'.. Various ways of reminding the reader of 
the mags heritage and vast past,  from a carefully selected sprinking of 
previous  articles,  (the  Polish Encyclopaedia for one) to a very  good 
alphabetical reference guide to the life and times of ST News (might  do 
one  for  Maggie someday..) There are a host of tributes from  past  and 
current people on the scene,  and even one from yours truly,  which gets 
its own article slot,  but don't ask why!  A wickedly pisstaking funeral 
ceremony wraps up this section..  Bringing the mag to current life are a 
few interviews,  including our own Felice, and Stefan 'Digital Insanity' 
Postuma and Tim 'former Lost Boy' Moss,  although these latter two would 
rather  like  to  be known as top level coders for  rather  swish  games 
developers now..

The  editorial  brings a lot of personal stuff ie.  Karin ;-)  into  the 
picture, we get the final appearance of such long running columns as the 
adventure  solutions,  the  diskmag  encyclopaedia  (although  this  may 
continue elsewhere (Hint!)) and even 'Did you know that..'

On the reviews front,  not a lot doing on the computer side, as we see a 
review  of 'Positive Image',  various diskmags,  and other smallish bits 
and  pieces of software,  with Mike Noyce ably assisting there..  If I'm 
going  to find a weak spot in the mag,  it has to be this diminishing of 
the  'ST'  part  of 'ST-News'..  I get the impression  that  Richard  is 
slightly bored with this aspect,  and has mostly moved away from dealing 
with this for some time beforehand anyway.. Indeed, he confides that his 
future Atari activities may well be restricted to a PC 'Gemulator'  type 
of  set-up,  which  does  not bode well for future access  to  the  more 
interesting Atari-type software..  On the plus side, he does incorporate 
a  press  release  from Mike Kerslake about the  new  'Atari  Computing' 
magazine, putting that at the beginning of the mag as 'Good News!'
 
Of course, the multimedia aspect blossoms hugely, as there are the usual 
massive  weightings of music writings and album reviews of a  distinctly 
heavy and metallic nature, films, books and video are gaspingly bringing 
up the rear..  Interesting in passing,  very interesting for the fans of 
these  bands,  this  reviewer,  not  so  bothered..  Purely a matter  of 
personal taste..

The  'middle  bit' otherwise known as the fiction section has  a  bumper 
crop of stories, including the final installments of a 'Bloodless Coup', 
with  a stunning shock ending type of thing..  Other stories are of  the 
psycho thriller genre, and are pretty readable..

Of   great   usefulness   are   the   extremely   comprehenisve   cheats 
enclyclopaedia,  and  the  final  explanation of how to get to  all  the 
hidden articles in ST News, bar the ones in this issue!

As  in the past,  really too much to take on in a single go,  unless the 
matchsticks holding up your eyelids are extra strong ones..  This really 
is a double issue,  with a double load of articles to read (although not 
on the computing side perhaps..) Regrettably we won't be seeing any more 
of these, but perhaps a tenth anniversary is a good place to quit whilst 
you're ahead.. We should be seeing something of Richard in future issues 
of  Maggie,  and  perhaps  we  may be able to continue  and  update  the 
diskmags  encyclopaedia..  (A  column already out of date in  places  as 
there  are  several  that  are  considered  'alive'  that  ought  to  be 
reclassified  firmly  as 'dead!' - Even one or two more that  have  come 
into being since!!)

Summary:- Very last issue,  no more, sorry.. Comes on two D/S or one H/D 
disk,  but  needs  to be assembled to hard drive,  or maxi-formatted H/D 
disk.. Shell, as ever blue. Falcon, and probably loads of other hardware 
compatible..  Articles,  the very best, although a bit light on computer 
stuff.. Prospects, errm, that's all folks!!

Overall, Nine and a half out of ten, thanks for everything Rich! 


                              ST+ Issue 8  

And here is another issue of the monthly mag that is going from strength 
to  strength,  now  getting up to issue eight..  Dave Hollis (the editor 
dude)  has  managed to keep the infectiously fun and  clubby  atmosphere 
that was the trademark of the sadly defunct Power magazine.. At the same 
time,  there  have  been some welcome additions to the mag with two  new 
writers joining the team.. 

Martin  Wilson  adds  the  long awaited Falcon  coverage  as  the  newly 
appointed  Falcon  editor..   His  writing  takes  in  some  interesting 
technical  asides,  especially  with  subjects such as 'Bad  Mood',  the 
Falcon Doom clone, and Elite and its ability to work on the '030.. 

The  next new addition is even more interesting,  and indeed,  should be 
handled with care..  Jody Smith is a unique writing talent,  and that is 
understating  matters  somewhat..  His  remit  is  general  madness,  an 
interesting  line in silly phone calls,  and also a lot of research into 
where classic 'missing' games have attained their narrow stony ledge  in 
development hell..

"Typical  Jody advice - Tips for the Summertime - "Why not eat  Brekkies 
(a  catfood  biscuit) instead of Wheetos,  they're cheaper,  and you get 
much  more  choice of flavours..  You simply can't get Rabbit and  Liver 
flavoured Wheetos.." - Well....

The rest of the mag is the usual mixture of news,  reviews, good advice, 
Programming   tips,   graphical  sideways  warped  humour  at  cigarette 
advertising,  major league wibble,  and more.. A good and varied read as 
you might expect, and made even more appetising with the addition of the 
two new writers..
 
Technically,  a few changes since issue five as well,  with the addition 
of  a  very nice menu piccy (a Bisley pic of a bloke with  a  great  big 
machine  gun  in this issue 'The Punisher') and the  addition  of  sound 
samples  which do their thing at certain key points,  loading,  quitting 
text  etc..  Even more changes are on the way with another reworking  of 
the  menu shell by Tony Greenwood..  One expected facility is a  Maggie-
alike  ability  to  display  16 colour  pictures  from  an  article,  to 
complement the 4 colour 'picture-within-text' system currently in use.. 

The  standalone  Sentroid document displayer for  machines  with  lesser 
memory  has also been improved,  now enabling half-meg owners to see the 
articles  including the pictures exactly as they would look  within  the 
main  shell  program..  This assembly coded effort by Steven Moore  even 
works  on a Falcon,  but it does some interesting things with hard drive 
directories suggesting a reset aftwards is advisable..

The same rules are in force for the main menu, which uses 'Backwards' to 
boot  it..  There is a varying success rate with the scrolly intro which 
loads  ahead of the magazine,  possibly according to the TOS version  of 
the Falcon it is running on, so it is advisable to disable that..

Two very tiny niggles for Dave,  1.  Can we turn the samples off, as the 
replay is rather crackly on the Falcon,  and,  2. How about an option at 
the start to bypass the intro and just load the magazine??

But those microscopic nigglets aside, ST+ is a worthwhile and successful 
monthly Atari Diskmag,  indeed, currently the *only* monthly publication 
of  any  sort,  since ST Format went to the great car boot sale  in  the 
sky..  (Dunno about ST Applications,  are they monthly??) ST+ needs your 
support  as  much  as possible,  why not try a copy and see..  (See  the 
advert in the adverts section)

Summary:-  Monthly release,  single D/S disk and with a rather nice STOS 
custom shell.. Falcon compatible with a wee bit of help from 'Backward', 
articles good,  with a touch of brilliance in places,  Prospects, damned 
good and getting constantly better..

Overall, Eight out of ten, make this a regular monthly reading habit..

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
           Diskmag News - All the stuff vaguely fit to print  

Lots  (at least two things) going on this time around as DBA  close  and 
FOG is reborn!

The   well-known  Dutch  Falcon  scene  publication,   the   Diskbusters 
Association Magazine (DBA Mag) is no more! (Scream!)

The reasons why they have discontinued are still unclear at this  stage, 
but it seems that Slimer may well have experienced differences with some 
of the co-writers,  although this is unconfirmed.. Also very possible is 
a general disenchantment with the 'scene' and scene related  activites.. 
From  talking to him at Symposium,  it was clear then,  that DBA did not 
have many more issues in them and Slimer himself was contemplating going 
more  to the 'business' side of things..  Indeed ample evidence of  this 
disenchantment can be found in the Symposium 'Realtime' article text now 
viewing in this issue of Maggie instead.. 

As  with Richard Karsmakers,  there may well be future appearances in  a 
future issue of Maggie with the odd textfile (or three!) by him.. 

On  the good news front,  it seems that John Nott (aka VoGue) has  taken 
over Richard Davey's interest in the Falcon Owners Group (FOG), and also 
the  largely  defunct 'Falcon Update Digital' diskmag with  it..  Rumour 
control in the latter part of 1995 was unable to entirely suppress  talk 
of  a new and superbly programmed custom Falcon shell written by  Al  of 
Psychosis for FOG, but never used by Rich Davey.. Now Rich's Falcon, and 
FOG  have  all fallen into the hands of VoGue,  the man  behind  'Skynet 
Times', who gave up that magazine largely through lack of a decent shell 
program..

Now  he  may have the last laugh on all of us!  Hope to see it  sometime 
before Maggie 22, and great to have a new competing diskmag..

More as we get it..

Also  this time,  word of another HTML based publication,  'Atari Times' 
which  started out life as the Croft Soft newsletter has  reached  issue 
four  as  of August 1996..  As well as specific information about  Croft 
Soft,  and  the  games they are releasing,  there is also a mixed bag of 
reviews,  previews  and more general news too..  Presentation is sparse, 
compared with some other recent HTML-based efforts, but good enough, and 
reasonably  informative..  One which seems to get bigger with each issue 
and  worth  keeping  an  eye  on..  More of their  newest  game  in  the 
'Previews' column as well..

Another  'newbie'  diskmag,  ST  Highway has reached issue  three..  Not 
seeing  a  lot  of it before,  first impressions are a  bit  vague,  but 
stylistically  seems  to be a 'younger' version of Kelstar..  It uses  a 
very similar interpretation of the TOMS shell.. Some articles promising, 
others  netgrabs or bobbins,  the usual mix for a young diskmag in other 
words.. We'll see how they develop as time goes on in future issues.. 


                     **Late News update on DBA!!**

At  this  late stage (nine days to release date) we have  received  word 
from  Bonus and some of the other members of DBA..  It seems that DBA is 
dead,  but the Dutch scene live on with a new group being established to 
work  on various games and demos,  and even a CD-ROM compilation for the 
Falcon..  Amongst other things,  an 'unofficial' release of DBA issue 15 
is  on the cards as well..  The DBA Symposium realtime article and other 
DBA  material  scheduled  to appear here has  been  'pulled'  from  this 
issue..  Which is not necessarily a bad thing as space is getting rather 
tight  in here!!  (Although if nothing happens by the time Maggie 22  is 
ready, we may well reinstate that material!!)

More  specific  information can be found in the 'letters' column  as  to 
what Bonus is doing in the near future..

That's your lot for diskzines this time folks!
