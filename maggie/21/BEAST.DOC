First Sight: Mr. Pink
---------------------

You can accuse Psygnosis of  many  things.  Failure to cash-in on game
ideas is not one of them. Lemmings  was released on about 84 different
formats, and whilst  Shadow  Of  The  Beast  didn't  quite  match this
number, it did rear its ugly had on a number of systems.

For those of you with very  short  memories (e.g. Northern Uproar fans
and Windows 95 users) Shadow  Of  The  Beast  was a platform game that
rocked the Amiga world a couple  of  centuries ago. It was designed to
use all that  nifty  Amiga  hardware  to  its  full  potential. We had
massive sprites, loads of  levels  of  silky smooth parallax scrolling
and some lovely tracker music. Unfortunately the gameplay was lacking,
but then the Amiga's custom chips  didn't include a "playability chip"
(something that was fitted as standard on 8-bit machines).

The ST conversion was a travesty.  Of  course the tracker music had to
be ditched during the game, as did  most of the colours, and the speed
and  the  smoothness  of  the   scrolling.  The  gameplay  was  vastly
unchanged, but most ST owners  didn't  want  to play an initially poor
game that looked worse than the Amiga version, and who can blame them.

On starting this game you notice  that  the presentation, as you would
expect for  Psygnosis,  is  excellent.  We  begin  with  the Sheffield
Wednesday inspired owl drenched logo,   the  head  of which scales and
fades into the screen. More sprite scaling malarkey follows with a big
"SOTB" logo and fierce  monster  head  thing  popping  up. The credits
scroll over this.

After starting the game for the first time, you hesitate for a second.
Woah! This is nice! The sky is resplendent with colours and clouds. In
the background we  have  the  gray  outline  of  fantastical mountains
whilst in the foreground with have  lush  trees and a couple of layers
of grass. Try running  along  and  you  we  see that everything shifts
about at a more than healthy  rate  and features silky smooth hardware
scrolling. It is like having an  Amiga  in  your hand, but without the
fear of crashing, viruses or having to run workbench!

Throughout the game the graphics  are  absolutely superb - they really
do showcase the  lynx's  graphical  ability.  Run  this  alongside any
GameBoy or GameGear game and they will look stone-age in comparison.
Even the out of game graphics such as the death picture are superb.

The sound, not one of  the  Lynx's  strongpoints,  is also pretty good
with some nice haunting melodies that fit in well with the game.

The game itself is a platform  exploration  game with some minor beat-
em-up elements  and  small  amount  of  pretty  straightforward puzzle
solving. It is also very, very hard!

You basically only have one life,  represented  by a health bar at the
bottom of the screen. When this runs  out you do have 3 continues, but
they move you back to the start  of  the section you are currently on,
so they are pretty useless.

Avoiding monsters and killing  them  requires pedantic pixel accuracy.
If you a microsecond too slow  or  too  quick  or a pixel out then you
will sustain some unwanted health  loss.  This  is very annoying. What
makes this doubly frustrating is  that  monsters you have killed don't
stay dead, if you return to  an  area you have previously visited, all
the creatures you massacred will suddenly  be reborn. I really despise
this! I suppose it is an attempt to make the game seem bigger and more
challenging than it really is,  but  for  me  it  is  just a source of
annoyance.

I see Shadow Of The Beast more as  a  showpiece - a demo if you like -
than a real game. It is worth getting  hold of to see what the Lynx is
capable  of,  but  prolonged  playing   sessions  are  beast  avoided.
Graphically, though, its the beast  knees.  Beast in our time! (That's
enough crap Beast jokes. ED)



Second Sight: Ripley
--------------------

This game looks amazing.  I was  so  busy  gazing at all the levels of
parallax in the sky and foreground  that  I  didn't notice where I was
going,  promptly ran into a bunch of monsters and thus disintergrating
into a pile of bones.  And that really sums Shadow of the Beast up, it
is graphically amazing, but  even  when  you  are looking where you're
going, it's really quite difficult.
     The  background  graphics  consist   of   clouds,  weird  distant
mountains with  houses  and  bridges,  as  well  as  plenty  of trees,
everything all beautifully drawn.   The  many  different monsters have
exceptional animation, fluid in the  extreme,  I  mean where else will
you  find  bats  with  a   realistic  flying  action?   Everything  is
gorgeously designed.  In fact the only average sprite is your own.
     The music is quite  good,  a  lot  better  than  the average Lynx
stuff, but not as good as something  like Klax.  The sound effects are
a nice addition, especially since they  help  to warn  of the approach
of various monsters and missiles.
     There are a lot of  nice  little  touches  to  the game, like the
primitive  treemen  which  wait  high  up   in  trees  until  you  run
underneath, before jumping down to attack you, red flying dragons that
drop bombs near you which  explode  after  a few seconds, spiders that
dangle on webs until  you  shoot  them  down, jumping snakes,  statues
that breathe fireballs and throw glass spheres in the air..  All these
diverse monsters require different  methods  of  attack,  to kill them
most effectively  and  so  you  are   always  experimenting, learning,
perfecting and usually there is one way  which works  best so when you
find it you feel a  sense  of  achievement  and  can  progress further
into the game. But a lot of the monsters  are  hard  to  kill and your
life runs down very quickly.  Having said that, there are  quite a few
things you can collect to increase  your life (hearts,  potions..) but
once these have been used, they do  not  reappear,  whereas  monsters,
even if you've   killed  them,  always  regenerate  at their  allotted
place, so there is an imbalance.
     There is a nice, if nostalgically  old  section of the game where
you are inside a tree, a tree  which is deceptively larger inside than
out, and where you have to  climb  ladders  and time jumps onto moving
platforms.  We shouldn't really complain  that this is hardly original
because after all Shadow of the Beast  is an old game, and proudly so.
But since so many games before  and  since  have done the same sort of
thing, it can become a little tried and tested.
     To sum up, Shadow of the Beast is beautiful, but it's a bitch.

The Verdict:             Shadow of the Beast
