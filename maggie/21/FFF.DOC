The Falcon FacTT File was launched in Dec 1993 by Kev Beardsworth, 
Colin Fisher-McAllum and Roger Derry. Originally a user group for 
Falcon owners, the FFF was set up to encourage user to help user. 
Things either move on or stagnate, the FFF cannot be accused of 
standing still. First we produced a listing of members and their set 
ups using Roger's NameNet Address Manager. It wasn't long before Hints 
& Tips were being sent in by members, these were added to the listing. 
Kev and Colin started writing reviews of the new soft/hardwear they 
bought and published them in the listing. Again the adventurous 
members sent in their articles for inclusion. NameNet coped well but 
the text content was by now getting very heavy and we wanted to 
include screenshots... We now use CAB the HTML-Browser!

As we share a common CPU, the Motorolla 68030, owners of TTs and 
PAKs were invited to join us. A Falcon FacTT File message echo was 
opened on NeST and the distribution of the monthly listings joined the 
20th century and is now hatched into the Network as an encrypted 
archive to protect members personal data. The echo proved popular and 
to spread it wider was gated with FanFiles. Having been bitten by the 
comms bug our own BBS has been opened, 42BBS is the home of the Falcon 
FacTT File and offers personal InterNet addresses, closed message and 
file areas to members as well as the usual Networked echoes. Running 
on a Falcon, 24 hours a day at speeds up to 28,800 on +44 
(0)1256-895106, 42BBS is open to all, but FFF members have the bonus 
of extra online time and download limits.

If you are thinking of buying a new Word Processor, find a member 
who has the one you are interested in and give them a call to ask what 
they think of it. Or if you have just bought a printer and having 
trouble setting it up, look for a member with the same set-up and call 
for advice. In this way you will soon build up a group of contacts 
with similar soft/hardware and general computing interests.

The completed and signed membership form (if under 18 years signed 
by a parent or guardian and noted as such) must be received by us, 
with a High Density disk and return postage (or International Postage 
Coupons). The FFF is distributed in the first week of each month. The 
file itself is a NameNet Address Manager data listing of all members 
plus hints, tips, questions and answers. Our reviews/news are in HTML 
format. The version of NameNet supplied is Shareware, members may 
register at special rates. CAB [HTML-Browser] is also supplied. The 
listing is updated monthly and the PD is refreshed quarterly. It is 
therefore, worth upgrading every three months.

The Data Protection Registrar informs us that there is no legal 
problem of the FFF listing being made available on line if it is 
encoded and only members are given the encryption code. A member would 
have to call Kev or Colin for the latest code once they have 
downloaded the file. Upgrades via post or Email would be accepted. 
Members without modems may still contact others by phone or post.

FFF membership is free. Therefore, without return postage and a disk 
[if required] we will not be able to respond. All we ask members to do 
is, if joining or upgrading by post, always supply return postage and, 
if you have some new PD/Shareware (or the fruits of your own 
programming!) that would be of interest to other members, put it on 
the disk.

May the FFForce be with you!
