     YES!  Jesus Maria J Thramanthrapkiajia is back! in a new film entitled 'Cry
Cabbage Patch Doll, Cry'.  This  is  his  first  major release since the massive
success of 'Orange Ripples on the Brown Curtains', made on a œ2.52 budget in the
back garden of a council flat  in  Brixton,  in  which he played a poignant, yet
harried postman who handed an electricity bill to the occupants of the flat.

     There has  been  extensive  discussion  and  speculation  as  to  how  this
harrowing   part  affected  the  direction  of  his  career,  some  say  that it
prompted him to accept the part of the  browser in the toy shop, in 'Cry Cabbage
Patch Doll, Cry', saying that in this film,  the state of his dress shows him to
be a poor, humble person, unable to  afford  the  wondrous toy he is looking at,
sorrowfully aware of his own situation  in  relation  to the glamour of the toys
around him and perhaps with a tear, glinting  in his eye at the nostalgia of the
moment?  We are of course, left with a  nagging doubt as to the validity of this
possibility because the camera  is  too  lovingly  held  on his worn, threadbare
tweed jacket for us to glimpse his face.  This of course sparks off another area
which may have fuelled  the motivation to focus his career in the darker passage
represented by this new  film.   The  'faceless'  quality  of  the  part adds an
anonymousness, a sinister twist to him and  we all remember his starring role in
'IT Came From The Black Lagoon', in  which  he  played the left arm of the giant
swamp monster, the arm with  which  most  of  its heinous murders were primarily
committed.  'Cry Cabbage Patch Doll, Cry' could mark a reassertion of the darker
side of  his  persona,  a  return  to  his  savage,  primitive  element.   He is
reappraising the beast within.

     Overall, 'Cry Cabbage  Patch  Doll,  Cry',  is  a  good  film.  Interesting
acting, an interesting plot - I must just  take a moment to give a brief account
of the story:  Jesus plays a browser in a toy shop and while he is browsing, one
of the other characters sees a  'Spring  Time  Cabbage  Patch Doll' and falls in
love with it.  Unfortunately,  he  is  unable  to  afford  the  œ12.99 needed to
purchase his love, so he leaves  the  shop  vowing  never to return until he has
earned enough money to take his love out of her demeaning situation.  He wonders
aimlessly, searching for  jobs,  being  turned  away  and  eventually turning to
crime.  He recruits a gang of criminals to  help him break into the toy shop and
in the early hours of a winter morning,  they  break into the shop and seize the
doll which is carried away triumphantly.   However,  in his jubilation, the male
lead does not see the patch of ice on  the road and running from the shop, slips
on the ice and comes crashing down,  crushing  the doll beneath him and breaking
his neck.  It certainly is a poignant moment.

     Of course, we could not possible  end  this article without mentioning that
classic film, the one  we  ALL  remember,  starring  (of  course)  Jesus Maria J
Thramanthrapkiajia in a starring role along  side  Eric Von Olgiouson, Su 'Windy
Corner' Preston, Quentin 'Bend Over' Tiler and  Sharon 'Of Sheep and Men' Jones.
The film ('Flowing Dustbins' for those  of  you who haven't lived!!!) marked the
beginning of an unprecedented  career.   Jesus's  first,  bashful  lines - I say
lines, but there is still some debate  as  to whether he actually says "*Geroff"
or "Get off" because you do have to lip-read what he says because of the opening
music - still have the same tearfully potent effect on me as I hear them:

     "Oi! *Geroff!... that's my potato."

The story follows the lives of  a  collection of disadvantaged people, living in
dustbins and eating whatever they  find, Jesus' character unfortunately develops
food poisoning and dies during the  opening  credits,  you can see that the last
corner of his potato had turned mouldy.

     The entire collection  of  Jesus  Maria  J  Thramanthrapkiajia's films have
unfortunately never  been  graced  with  an  official  video  release (Hollywood
companies are just too scared of  the  damage  this  truly God blessed man would
wreak on their own pathetic excuses  for  actors)  but  can be purchased for 50p
from Ron at  the  corner  shop  (under  the  counter  in  the  old toaster box).
Generally they really  are  well  worth  watching  and  should  be available for
everyone to enjoy on their Friday and Saturday nights.
