[] ROAD GODS

The Reservoir Gods have announced  their  latest Falcon project. It is
an arcade game in the style  of  the  classic 8-bit game "Spy Hunter".
The game runs in true  colour  mode  and  features  a split screen two
player mode. Mr. Pink tells Maggie  "The  game was originally based on
Spy Hunter but we had  so  many  original  and  new ideas that we have
created a new game in its own right. There is a whole world to explore
and a series of missions to  complete.  If  you've always wanted to be
James Bond,  now  is  your  chance!".  This  game  has  a  provisional
Christmas release date.

[] FOLDER AND WISER

German demo  crew  have  finally  reached  their  award  winning  demo
"WURSCHT WIE DER ORDNER HEIBT". This  picked  up  the top prize at the
Symposium '96 convention. Wurscht requires  an  FPU  to run, so if you
haven't invested in one of  these  mathematically minded chips, now is
the time to do so.

[] DADLIFE

The Senior Dads are set to return  with  a brand new demo this autumn.
Scottish DSP Wizzdad "Nonce" told  Maggie  "The Demo is 95% complete".
Expect to see the Dads  grappling  with  contompary effects. Nonce has
revealed that one of the screens will  be the Senior's take on "Motion
Blur".

[] NO FUTURE

The long  running  British  Atari  Magazine  "ST  Format"  has finally
decided to call it a  day.  Atari  owners  nationwide are mourning the
loss of an old friend. The magazine had become a pale imitation of its
former self and we think it  is  probably  for  the best that they are
calling it a day. We wish them luck in their future projects.

[] LETS GO TO CORK...

The Reservoir Gods 100th registree has been named. Call it the luck of
the Irish as Aidan Keady from  Cork swoops the prize after registering
for "Sky-Fall" and "Tautology II".  A  spanking new T-Shirt emblazoned
with a smart design by SH3 is winging  its way across the Irish sea to
him.

[] THE PLACE TO BE OR NOT TO BE

The fourth "Place To Be Party" will be held in Mont-De-Marsan, France.
This annual event has gained  in  popularity  and has seen releases of
Falcon demos by such crews as EKO, Abstract and MJJ Productions. There
will be demo competitions for the ST  and  the Falcon and we will hope
to bring you a report of the results in the next issue of Maggie.

[] POLAND OF GOLD

The east may be a  breeding  ground  for  new  Atari talent. Poland is
emerging as a nation of Atari  followers. We have recently madecontact
with Atari owners in Gdansk and  they  inform  us that there are demos
and games being created for the Falcon and ST in this country. We have
received a couple of promising productions  and  we will try and bring
you a more in depth report on the Polish Atari scene in a future issue
of Maggie.

[] I'M SO SORRY. HE'S FROM BARCELONA.

The Falcon scene in Spain  is  still  going strong. The Reservoir Gods
have released Spanish language  versions  of  "Tautology  II" and more
recently "God  Paint"  and  "Double  Bobble  2000".  As  we  speak the
finishing touches are being put to  the Spanish version of "Sky-Fall".
The Reservoir Gods want to personally thank all the Spanish users that
registered for God-Paint.

[] COSMIC CAPERS

Prolific German games creator Markus  Binder  has announced details of
his new project. It is entitled  "COSMIC"  and is a departure from his
usual style of games.  It is a fast texture mapped shoot-em-up running
in true colour mode.  A  full  preview  is  included  elsewhere in the
issue.

[] GIGAFUN BOY ENTRY

Therapy are fast  making  a  name  for  themself  as  one  of the most
prolific demo crews in Germany.  Not  content  to sit on their laurels
with the release of "Wurscht" they are  beavering away on an intro for
the Gigafun party. This is the  kind  of  spirit we want from our demo
coders!

[] CONNOR NEW MAG

A new Atari magazine  is  being  created  by  Joe Connor, ex-writer of
Atari world and  the  bloke  behind  the  Atari  Interactive shareware
support scheme. This will be  a  paper  based production and should be
the natural successor to ST Format. Rumours are that he has drafted in
top writers like Frank Charlton and even  some of the Maggie staff may
get involved! The first issue will  be released at the Goodmans' Atari
Shows in September.

[] THE SPICE OF LIFE

Martin Steen,  author  of  Pac-Them,  has  unveiled  his  latest game.
"SPICE" is a true colour defender clone with some great sound effects.
Steen fans will be pleased to know  that it oozes with playability and
addictiveness and is well worth getting hold of.

[] SATURN ALIVE

The Saturn 3 party went ahead  in  Paris earlier this month. There was
only a small Falcon presence  and  it  is  not known whether any Atari
demos were released. We will  hope  to  bring  you  a full report in a
future issue of Maggie.

[] LUNAR KICKS

French bound king "Crac" has  completed  his latest Falcon game. "Moon
Games" is a follow  up  to  the  great  "Moonspeeder"  and  it will be
released freeware so all Falcon owners will be able to play it!

[] DARK SIDE OF THE TOONS

"Yepyha" creators TooNs are already  busy  on  a new production. Coder
Patrice  Bensoussan  tells  Maggie  "We  have  actually  several  demo
projects. We have  some  effects  already  coded  and  I  think you'll
probably see some new productions of TooNs in the near future".

[] PASCAL'S PISTOL

Technoball author Pascal Ognibene is  busy  working  on a new game for
the Falcon. Early details are pretty sketchy but we believe it will be
a hardware scrolling shoot-em-up.

[] THE ANSWER IS 42

The Reservoir Gods now have then own  area on the 42BBS. This contains
all our Falcon productions so  if  you  have  a  modem don't forget to
check it out. 42BBS is the  home  of  the  Falcon FacTT File and has a
great deal of Atari related materail. Contact 42BBS at 01256-895106.

[] ARTO INTRO

Hydroxid, the French coding team  who  contributed so magnificently to
the recent symposium party,  are  back  at  their assemblers. They are
busy working on a series of effects  for  a new demo and also an intro
for a future issue of Maggie.

[] EXTRA TIME OF MY LIFE

A shadowy mysterious figure known  only  as  "The  Mad Haxman" has got
hold of the source code for Kick-Off  Extra Time. He is currently busy
constructing a Falcon remix  which  should  run  stably  on our 32-bit
beast and also have a series of  extra features. Dino Dini was said to
be ashen faced and tight lipped at the time of going to press.

[] FROM COAST TO JOUST

More gaming talent is appearing from Britain. News reaches Maggie that
Jack Russell infleunced Gloucestor  based  NJR productions are working
on a Joust style game for the  Falcon.  It will run in 256 colour mode
and is in the very early stage of development.

[] MPEG OUT YOUR WASHING

News reaches Maggie about an MPEG playing screen saver for the Falcon.
It should also play  a  MOD  simultaneously  and project leader Graham
Jarvis reckons he will have "a screen saver to rival 'Before Dawn'".

[] WILLIE GROWS IN SIZE

Legendary Swedish platform  game  "Willie  the  adventurer"  is taking
shape. According to the latest reports  from our Swedish friends a lot
of the enemy sprites have now  been  designed  and the game is looking
gorgeous.

[] GO WITH THE SHOW

Despite the collapse of original sponsor  "ST Format", the Atari shows
will go ahead as  scheduled.  Goodmans  International  is now the main
power behind the show and it  is  great  to see someone throwing their
weight behind the Atari. The shows will  be held on September 28th and
29th and there will be a Reservoir Gods Maggie stand! See you there!

[] THE MESSIAH IS MY NEMESISTER

Titan designs should be shipping their excellent Nemesis upgrade board
by the time you read  this.  This  speeds  up  all areas of the Falcon
(CPU, DSP, system bus) and Apex 3  has been designed to take advantage
of this increase in performance.  Nemesis  received  a couple of small
delays but should be well worth the wait.

[] BODIN BOMBS OUT

Alistar Bodin, long time head of  software development at Atari UK has
left the company. This is a real  shame  because he did so much to get
all those hundreds of  Jaguar  and  Falcon  games published. What will
Atari do without him? (Maybe release a game? Ed).

[] LET ME PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE

Therapy Seriouz Software is a new label that has been set up to create
professional Atari software. Their  first  release  will be "SMURF", a
very comprehensive image conversion and processing package. For a full
preview see elsewhere in Maggie.

[] CWM AND HAVE A GO IF YOU THINK YOU'RE HARD ENOUGH

The Reservoir Gods held  their  3rd  annual  convention  at the end of
August. One of the highlights of this event was the "war of the roses"
cricket match which featured some  demon  fast bowling from Ripley and
some cheeky pinch hitting from  SH3.  The  main event was 24hour games
coding competition  in  which  programmers  created  versions  of  the
seminal "Worms". All entries  for  this  competition  should have been
released by the time you read  this.  For  a full report on this event
see Maggie 22.

[] AN EXA-LLENT RESULT

Late news reaches us  about  the  results  of  the competitions at the
Gigafun party. The  96ktro  competition  was  won  by  EXA  with a DSP
bashing demo called  "Entracte"  (roughly  translated "Intermission").
This is a  great  little  demo  that  puts  all  the  96ktros from the
Symposium to shame. Second place went to Therapy with a demo featuring
bump-mapping for the first time on the Falcon!

[] ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW STRONGER

Top German Falcon demo and games  coding crew "Absence" released there
demo "joint venture" at  the  Gigafun  party.  This  demo  was seen at
Symposium '96 but due  to  unforseen  circumstances wasn't finished in
time for deadline for competition entries. "Joint Venture" scooped the
top prize at Gigafun and we hope to  be reviewing in the next issue of
Maggie.
