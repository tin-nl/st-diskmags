                    Relatively straight this time??

A quick who's who, or what's what on the people who are responsible for 
bringing you this thing..  They did the deed collectively,  and will be 
punished in the same manner very shortly.. Here follows my variation on 
an old, old joke that has been around for far too long..

CiH..
Might be sometimes known as Chris Holland on wanted posters.. Editor in 
chief,  no.1, Darth Vader, Can leap tall buildings with a single bound, 
catch  bullets  with  his teeth,  pull an express train to  Lands  End, 
communes regularly with God..

Mr Pink..
Chief  programmer (Falcon Shell),  staff writer and last surviving Leon 
O'Reilly  left in the British Isles..  Can leap medium sized  buildings 
after taking a run up to them,  can catch bullets with an armour plated 
baseball glove,  pull a shunting engine out of the station.. Is allowed 
to exchange polite small talk with God, and listen carefully to what he 
has to say afterwards..

Tat..
Chief programmer (funky intros and ST shell), staff writer, Tattershall 
and  not related to George Formby by an illicit extramarital  episode.. 
Can jump over semi-detached houses with a bit of effort, sensibly ducks 
away from bullets,  pulls a scale model express train around a circular 
bit  of track until told to stop it,  and avidly reads God's syndicated 
column in the Sunday Times..

Mikey Noycey..
Staff writer,  former ST-News gang-member, and resident PC guru (uggh!) 
Can jump over low fences blindfolded,  can draw a picture of a gun from 
memory, has an amazing grip on railway timetables and supersaver fares, 
and sends morse code messages to God

Taff..
Staff  writer,  also  former  ST-News conspiritor..  Can manage to  tie 
his  shoelaces  without  help,  hold his breath underwater,  knows  the 
story  of Gordon the Big Engine off by heart,  and leaves rude messages 
on God's ansaphone.. 

Felice..
Deputy  Editor  and online correspondant..  Leaves bloodstains  on  the 
sides  of tall buildings when he attempts to jump them,  can be left to 
play  unsupervised in a puddle,  can say the word 'choo choo' with only 
slight  difficulty,  and frequently confuses the spelling of 'God' with 
that of 'Dog'..

Ripley..
Staff  writer,  and  mad poetry person,  awarded Distinguished  Service 
Order for being Leon's sister.. Picks up buildings and walks underneath 
them, kicks express trains off the track, freezes bullets in mid-flight 
by staring at them.. SHE IS GOD!!


The rest of them..
