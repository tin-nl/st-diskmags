                       Advertise Here for Free!! 

With  the  recent demise of the last commercial  news  stand  magazines 
advertisers  are  now  having  to look for  alternatives..  As  a  non-
commercial diskmag, we are quite happy to take advertising from a range 
of people ABSOLUTELY FREE OF CHARGE! 

Maggie  is not quite a regular production,  but instead tends to appear 
on  an 'as and when' basis..  Anyone who advertises for commercial gain 
may  have to bear this in mind and should best approach us towards  the 
completion date of an issue.. (About the end of this year for issue 22) 

Any user groups or individuals are welcome to approach us at any  time, 
although  with  the  same  risk that their  submission  might  not  see 
daylight for a little while also..  Unless  the waiting world wants  to 
get cracking on reams of new textfiles for Maggie 22, that is..

We repeat, this won't  cost a single penny,  we are hardly likely to be 
going 'commercial' by now, so get in touch!

Whom to contact?

Mee!! (No seriously now!)
