                            A GAME FOR THE FALCON030

                               BY RESERVOIR GODS

================================================================================

Sky-Fall is an arcade  game  for  the  Atari  Falcon030.  It takes elements from
classic games such as Columns and Tetris  and blends them into an altogether new
game. It retains all the addictiveness of its ancestors, but it updates them for
the 32-bit age with True Colour graphics and DSP based stereo sound.

As well as having to remove standard  tiles  there  are bonus tiles which can be
matched to create different effects. The "Ghost"  tiles will cause you to become
haunted by one of a  selection  of  misfortunes.  Fortunately  you can match the
protective pendants and defend yourself from the wrath of the ghosts.

Sky-Fall is a great one player game. But it is even better when you get a couple
of friends round and battle it out  in  multiplayer  mode. Up to four people can
play simultaneously using  any  combination  of  joysticks,  keyboard and jaguar
powerpads.

In the multiplayer game  the  ghosts  that  you  collect  will  move on to haunt
another player, hampering them in  their  endeavour  to  complete the level. You
will grow to fear  certain  ghost  effects  and  cackle  evily  when you unleash
"double-lock" on your (ex)friend!

This is just scratching the surface  of  Sky-Fall's  features. There are so many
different ways which you can play the  game.  You  can try to fill up your board
and you lose points for making matches.  This  builds  to a hectic climax as you
race to completely smother your board before your oppenent does.

You can play against the clock, or  set  yourself a target score to reach before
getting to the next level, or just have a set number of clusters to arrange. You
can alter the frequency  of  the  ghosts  and  other  shapes.  You can basically
customize every aspect of the game so it suits you!

Fortunately all configuration data is  saved  and automatically reloaded so Sky-
Fall will always be set up the way you like when you load it.

There are different high score  tables  for  different game set ups. Altogether,
there are 45 high score tables and they are all saved when you quit (if you ever
want to quit!)
