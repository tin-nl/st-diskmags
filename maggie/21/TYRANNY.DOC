 I've found that the best time to watch demo's is at night, tuck away the kids 
(or lock 'em away in a cupboard),  get some snacks handy, turn out the lights, 
put the stereo on low.....turn the lights back on when you're done, smoke a fag 
or  two.......then it's time to sit down to some serious demo  watching,  turn 
the lights out again, turn the stereo up high..heh! heh!.

[At  his time I ought to point out to those of you who are more 'seasoned'  in 
the way' of demo's that something 'old as the hills' to you will STILL be  new 
to  someone  who's  not seen it....my apologies in the mean time if  I  get  a 
little too simplistic about my reviewing techniques].

   So,  another  demo  comes  flying  into  my  diskdrive...and  promptly  get 
slamdunked onto me hard drive, yup, the fist of a few bonus points methinks.

  Well,  as demo's go Tyranny is not  so bad,  it's fast,  it's smooth and  it 
never give you time to get bored,  a nice tune starts off the intro and  after 
the usual 'we are' type messages it's off to the main part.

  From the intro to the main demo there's a rather nasty wait that could  have 
been filled with a few small GFX (IMHO),  instead a plain, simple black screen 
greets  your  eyes,  once  your  into the demo  though  all  that  is  quickly 
forgotten.

 Somewhat reminiscent of the grotesque genre of demos's tyranny takes you on a 
roller coaster ride of thumping musix and screen FX, Plasma also seems to be a 
favourite of coders, not suprising really as a relatively small amount of code 
can produce this stunning effect,  plasma FX  kinda makes you forget about the 
colour limitations of the ST.

  From the usual FX comes some original V.D.U meters that ride along with  the 
music,  Ecstacy did the same with there 'drums' screen, same result, different 
application,  ever  onwards  come effects that range  from  visual  excellence 
through to plain 'n'straight forward,  the usual 3D vectors and swirling balls 
are tucked away in there I would imagine for the sake of tradition rather than 
to  show off new coding technique but hell,  why not,  again another  phase  I 
think is the 'rave' dancers, silowet....silhuette....sh*t, blacked out dancers 
strut their funky stuff in time to the musix,  great stuff that,  I've  always 
wondered which came first, the musix or the GFX....sod it, who cares, I'm just 
gonna sit back and enjoying the screens.

  Rez changes are a tricky business and I honestly don't know if a rez  change 
was implemented but some seriously fine lines start dancing around the  screen 
producing  some  stunning  FX that wouldn't be out of place framed  and  on  a 
living  room wall,  back once more to 3D vectors and what I can only  verbally 
describe as Synth vectors, you know, the type of digitised speech displayer.

  Amongst  the more noticable effects are the swirling 'zoomers',  this  is  a 
recent  discovery  to me and although some of 'em look either  cr*p  or  jerky 
Tyranny's zoomers look amongst the best I've seen...also a nice touch were the 
transluscent screens, a few vectors are thrown around revealing in their trail 
a little piccie underneath.

  Between  all  the main screens are the  usual  info,  credits  etc.  usually 
accompanied by a small 'in credits' screen,  Tyranny is very well put together 
methinks..

  Ever  onwards to the end bit,  here you'll see if your famous  or  not,  the 
latter  being the case with me coz I wasn't even a twinkle in  my  ST's  eye's 
when Tyranny came out (sob!)

 All over and done then and the big question is...how'd it do then.

  Well.....it's always the way,  you get to see the best demo ever one the  ST 
first  and then you find your comparing all the other efforts against  it,  oh 
well, I'll try and be unbias as ever...

GFX - 8/10, There good but I've seen better..

SFX - 10/10, Not even a hint of Chip music, great stuff.

Watchable - Yes..lot's of times - Hmmm,  tough one that,  if your a coding nut 
            then yes,if your  Mr joe 'I've not a clue' public then maybe  once 
            or twice.

V.F.M. - 10/10 How much better value do you want, it FREE.
