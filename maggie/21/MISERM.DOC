The pompous orchestral music. The  darkened auditorium. The spotlight. 
The black leather chair.  Magnus  Magnusson. "Your specialised subject 
is ...  Sewage systems  and  related  plumbing works in pre-industrial 
Britain". That was one  type  of  master  mind.  But  it  had a famous 
namesake.

The brown box. The row of  holes. The coloured pegs. "Your specialised 
subject is ... arranging colour pegs in the right order". Yes, this is 
a conversion of mastermind the board game.

For those of you unfamiliar  with  the  art  of  peg arranging, let me 
explain. Mastermind was a game  played  by  two protagnists. The first 
choose 5 pegs and put them in any  order in a sequence of 5 holes that 
was hidden from the other  players  view.  The  second player tried to 
guess what order these pegs were in.  The "master" would then evaluate 
each guess, marking the number of pegs  that were the right colour and 
in the right position, and the  number  that  were the right colour in 
the wrong position.

Miser Mind is a GEM game.  Fortunately  you  don't have to worry about 
which resolution to run from as  it automatically configures itself to 
suit different resolution. 16 colour mode is recommended otherwise GEM 
fills are used to denote the different peg colours.

The game itself runs in a GEM  window. Along the bottom is a "palette" 
containing the different peg colours.  Above  this  are 12 lines which 
can be filled with guesses. At  the  top  is a special line which will 
display the correct sequence at the end of the game.

The game is totally mouse  based.  To  play  you  first click on a peg 
colour from the "palette", and then click  on the hole which you think 
the peg belongs to. When you have completed the line, you click on the 
evaluate button and it  dispalys  a  series  of crosses. Black crosses 
represent the number of pegs  that  are  the  right  colour and in the 
right place whilst white crosses represnet the number of pegs that are 
the right colour and in the wrong place.

The game is very configurable. You can  choose the amount of pegs that 
form a line, from 4 to 8. Obviously the more pegs in the line the more 
difficult it is to guess the combination. You can also choose how many 
different colours the pegs  come  in  from  6  to  12. Again, the more 
different colours of pegs you have  the  more difficult it is to guess 
the combination.

There are two other options you can toggle. You can decide whether you 
want lines to include blanks  (free  spaces)  and doubles (pegs of the 
same colour).

This game is not a visual  feast  or  an aural extravaganza. It is not 
going to grab you by the colour  and  whisk you off into gaming heaven 
in a stream of superb true colour graphics and astounding music.

But Miser Mind is a very good  game.  It  is a classic conversion of a 
classic board game and it will  run  happily  on all machines with the 
minimum of fuss. It is totally bug  free  and seems to include all the 
options you  could  possibly  want.  It  is  both  user  friendly  and 
playable. So don't be a Miser, and  don't forget to register! I'm sure 
Magnus Magnusson would approve.
