This  is  your editor speaking,  this glossary was originally found  in 
issue 12 of the Diskbusters Mag,  and looking at it, I thought, hey, as 
we're  due  to get several million new readers as a  result  of  seeing 
Maggie  at  the Autumn Atari Shows for the first time,  I thought  that 
such  a glossary would be very useful for Maggie where such  terms  are 
bandied  about  a lot in articles and are a bit of a  mystery  to  many 
casual or novice readers.. 

I  did  not  feel like writing one from scratch,  so in the  spirit  of 
mutual assistance and brotherhood of Magnetic Interlude, I pinched this 
one instead!!  However,  to make up for this, I have added some entries 
of my own,  coming over all trainspottery and showing off my knowledge, 
or lack thereof of certain favourite subjects.. 

I've  also pinched this from Maggie issue 18,  and added some more bits 
since then.. This makes me a really cheeky spacefilling git!!

Thanks  to  Slimer  (The tall Dutch bloke who looks a  bit  like  Robin 
Asquith) for the original..
     
On wit' the show folks..CIH..


                           GLOSSARY
        EXPLANATION OF USED COMPUTER TERMS IN THIS MAGAZINE


Re-re-edited version.. (Just how many times!)

There are many "unknown" words in this magazine for some people who
are not familiar with certain computer terms.You will find a list with
the most used words from the computer scene (there are many more but I
decided to do only the important ones). We reach many people who don't
know that there is a computer scene or just don't participate on the
scene. So when those people start to read this magazine they stumble
on words that they never have heard of. For those people we made the 
following list:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coder         : Is a programmer.

GFX-man       : An artist that creates graphics with aid of the        
                computer(see GFX).

Music-man     : Someone who composes music with aid of a computer
                (see musax).

Cracker       : Someone who removes protections out of programs.

Hacker        : Someone who breaks into computer systems often 
                using a modem. 

Swapper       : Someone who trades computer programs with other        
                people mostly by mail.

Modem trade  : Someone who swaps programs with the aid of a modem.

Ripper       : That's a guy who steals/takes code/music and   
               graphics for use in his own demo or intro.

Phreaker       :Someone who does illegal and interesting things 
                with the phone system,  a term more often found 
                in 'underground' diskmags than the  mainstream 
                diskmags or press..  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code        : Code is just another word for a program or piece of    
              program language.

Routines    : Small piece of code that performs a specific task like
              playing a module or showing a picture. Lots of routines
              may well go on to make up a demo or game..Some Routines
              are repeatedly used, and may form part of a LIBRARY of
              often used bits of code.. This can save a lot of time
              for a programmer who does not have to REINVENT THE WHEEL.
          
              Rumours that Ocean Software had a standardised set of
              routines for their film licence games, in which they 
              just  changed the graphics a little  bit for each new 
              release are  probably true!! 

Scrolline    : Line of text that scrolls horizontal/vertical over     
               your screen.  Can  be  fancy text fonts,  large 
               sizes, fifteen million colours etc.. Usually used 
               to communicate non-vital information about the
               personal lives of the programmers and their friends..

GFX          : Grafix or just Graphics which means drawings and 
               pictures on the computer screen.

Piccy/pic    : A Picture (computer generated).

Vector       : Lines that can form 3-D objects on your screen.

Filled Vectors : The same objects but then they are filled with colors.

Shaded Vectors : Filled vectors, but with graduated light/dark
                 shading with a simulated light source for better
                 realism.. Can be depth shaded, darker as it gets
                 more distant onscreen, Gouraud, Phong etc,
                 according to the mathematical principles used
                 to generate the shading effect.. 

Texture mapped   : Pictures/graphics that are used on/as walls/objects
                   in games and demo's. Something like wallpaper made 
                   from computer graphics.

Logo            : The logo of the group who created an intro/demo, game  
                  or for instance a diskmagazine. logo is a recognition  
                  sign just like the one of a firm/company.

Distorted        : A waving effect(moving screen lines).

Raster(s)        :A  technique  of getting loads  of  colours  on 
                  screen  in  an  'all  colours  of  the  rainbow'  
                  fashion, commonly used to get more colours on
                  a limited palette computer such as the ST..
                  Usually used for background 'skyline' effects..

Plasma           :What happens if you distort and wave loads of
                  colours around.. Many variations on this theme.                     

Borders          :Those annoying white areas around the edge of the 
                  screen not used by your ST.. One very early staple
                  of demo coders was to try to eliminate these by
                  various means and put the wasted screen area to 
                  good use.. Hence, BOTTOM BORDER SCROLLERS which
                  used previously wasted screen area.. Also see
                  OVERSCAN..

Overscan         :A Hardware feature of the Falcon, which does
                  away with the border areas on Philips type
                  Monitors allowing you to use the whole screen
                  area.. Also standard on Amiga, and available
                  as a hardware fix for the STFM at least.. 

Truecolour       :A Falcon specific screen mode referring to the
                  number of colours available.. The Atari version
                  of 'Truecolour' is 65,536 colours available, or
                  sixteen bit.. This is a 'paletteless' screen
                  mode, where there are no restrictions on how 
                  you place the colours onscreen.. Purists consider
                  'Truecolour' to be Twenty-Four bit or 16 million
                  colours available, the Atari version is sometimes
                  referred to as 'Highcolour'.. Any Falcon specific
                  articles in Maggie will always refer to the Atari
                  version unless otherwise advised..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animation         :A computer generated 'movie' sequence, composed 
                   of a number of frames reminiscent of how a film
                   is stored but in a digital fashion.. Unlike most
                   decent demo effects, not generated in realtime
                   but still often impressive if done well.

.FLI              :The animation format generated by the PC animation
                   package '3-D Studio' - For a long time,the industry
                   standard on that machine - 16 and 256 colour
                   animations, variants include .FLC and .FLH 
                   truecolour versions..
                   Supported particularly well by Apex Media on the
                   Falcon..

.MPEG              :A more advanced animation format which also 
                   supports an audio soundtrack.. More commonly used 
                   for video clips and pre-recorded video disk movies
                   rather than computer generated material.. There are
                   a couple of public domain or shareware MPEG players
                   for the Falcon, which use the DSP. Other platforms
                   need special hardware, such as an MPEG card, or 
                   Philips CDI player, although the Falcon can only
                   run video at present there is a rumour of a full
                   MPEG player that supports audio as well..

.AVI              ;Also known as Video for Windows, a similar sort
                   of thing to MPEG, but this is the format most
                   supported on the PC, and indeed, built into 
                   Microsoft operating systems.. A difficult one 
                   on the Falcon at first, but now a decent .AVI 
                   player has finally arrived.. 

Quicktime         :The Apple Mac equivalent of the .AVI format, 
                   with a .MOV file extender..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Musax           : This is of course music and can be taken as 3        
                  different basic forms,
      
Chipmusic       : This is music that is composed on the built in
                  Yamaha YM2149 soundchip of a 'ordinary' ST.

Module       : This is music made up of small samples like a drumbeat
               a guitar Riff and many other small pieces. These small 
               samples can get sequenced. All those little samples    
               are forming a soundtrack which is called a module(also     
               known as mod.). This is the most popular form of music 
               because the quality is good and through the use of
               small samples the module stays small.
               
               Modules are very common and now take several forms..  
               Firstly, and most commonly is the Amiga four channel
               'Protracker' format. This with variations is the
               most common also on Atari ST and Falcon.. More 
               recently, there are Amiga eight-channel (Octamed),
               PC eight-channel (Fast Tracker), and a whole load
               of newer multi-channel formats including a Falcon
               specific Digital Tracker one of up to 32 channels
               (.DTM extender).. Another format of interest includes
               Screamtracker (PC, 32 channels, .S3M extender..)
               which is a more complex and effects laden format
               than usual.. The very latest PC format is Fasttracker
               two, which at least one Falcon tracker supports..  

Samples         : A piece of sound that is "recorded" with a sound-
                  sampler. The height of the sampling rate (kHz.) is      
                  related to the quality of the recorded sound. 
                  Disadvantage of a high sampling rate is the enormous   
                  flow of data. With a Falcon sampling a 20 seconds of   
                  music at 50 kHz you will wind up with many megabytes   
                  of data ! 
(Also)         
Sequenced samples : Repeating of samples in a music piece and thus
                    saving precious memory. For instance if the same
                    guitar Riff appears 4 times in a music piece,
                    you only have to record it once. This technique is
                    also used in modules.

Yamaha YM2149    :Sound  quality is  relatively  crude  synthesis
Basic Soundchip   method, generally sounds like the sort of noise
whole ST family   made by fruit machines, but some good composers
                  have achieved miracles even with this poor chip..
                  Latest efforts have managed to get a sound 
                  quality not too far off the venerable and fondly
                  remembered Commodore 64 SID chip..

DMA Sound        :This refers to the extra hardware present in the
STe, TT,          STe, which allowed direct memory access for sampled 
Mega STe          sounds, nominally a two channel left and right
Falcon            stereo output, but module players have managed 
                  four channels with ease, and stretched to fit in
                  eight channels.. One program under development
                  even allows up to thirty-two channels, but at a 
                  severe cost to sound quality.. Interestingly, the
                  Yamaha YM2149 sounds can be mixed in with the DMA
                  channels, though who would want to do that beats me!

Codec            :The advanced sound chip on the Falcon which allows
Falcon only       a normal eight channels at sixteen bit quality, but
                  this has been stretched again,  as it can produce 
                  up to thirty-two channels without too much of a
                  problem.. The Falcon can also sample in sound, as
                  well as play it out..


Summary:         :STFM, can play soundchip music with ease, four
                  channel modules with medium difficulty and medium
                  sound quality.. Sampling needs extra hardware..

                 :STe, can play soundchip music with ease, four
                  channel modules with ease, and at a good sound 
                  quality, more channels with deteriorating sound 
                  quality.. Sampling needs extra hardware.. The
                  TT and Mega STe are part of this category having
                  identical sound hardware..

                 :Falcon, can breeze four channel modules, can 
                  happily handle more, can also handle 'real-world'
                  digital audio, and was designed for this purpose..
                  Sampling hardware built in, and software also
                  available for direct to hard disk recording, both
                  at a professional and hobbyist level..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lamer             : Someone who doesn't belong on the scene and is not     
                    part of some kind of (well) known computer group.
                    It also could simply be an unpleasant person. 

Greetings         : A form of recognition that other groups know you.

Fuckings          : The opposite of greetings, often sprouted from 
                    competition or the ripping of code/graphs/music.
                    Much rarer these days, unless you are involved 
                    in the French scene and suffer from light
                    fingered Amiga owners.. (See Maggie 20)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mag.              : Magazine (can be either paper or digital).

Diskzine          : Diskmagazine (see Diskmagazine)

Diskmagazine      : Digital magazine on a computer floppydisk, often 
                    containing articles and programs. Advantages in
                    comparison with a paper magazine are,

                    Low costs to make
                    Small & compact (fits in your pocket)
                    Interactive 
                    Contains music 
                    It's Public Domain (in most cases). 
                    Articles with good coding tips
                    Not restricted to any rules, 
                    free to express opinions of any kind

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      
Intro             : A piece of code ( presentation screen ) in front
                    of a program. It's a series of effects/programming
                    tricks accompanied by music. The difficulty rate,
                    style, originality and execution of the performed
                    tricks is what's important.
                    
(Mega)Demo        : Demonstration of effects/programming tricks. Demo's    
                    are mostly intro's accessible through a main-menu.
                    Although a lot of megademos now tend to dispense
                    with the main menu, and are run-through affairs..

Dentro            : Something between an intro and a demo( without a 
                    main-menu ). Effects/tricks are shown in a
                    preordered sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packed/Crunched  : Programs that are made smaller to save disk space
                   with a special (compression) packing program. If
                   commands appear several times in a program, they get
                   replaced for instance by one character. Space can
                   also be compressed, all this leads to space saving.
                   Good packers can compress certain programs more than
                   60 percent or even higher !
                   On one Falcon demo, a 100+Kilobyte module was 
                   squeezed down to 22K, a compression ratio of
                   around 5 to 1!! Has this been bettered yet? 

Compil           : Compilation of many packed programs. Often 
                   compressing several diskfilling programs on one
                   single disk. These compils were very popular on
                   the ST/STE, on the Falcon however they are rare
                   (for the time being). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pseudo name   : The codename of an individual computer freak on the    
                scene. Pseudo names are mostly used by Hackers &
                Crackers in order to cover up their real name for
                obvious reasons. Other people who don't roam the
                illegal circuit use them just for fun.

Crew/group        : Several mostly talented individuals forming a
                    group. Their main goal is to code better programs
                    than the competition or simply to have some fun.
                    These groups also have names ( like for instance
                    the D.B.A. ).

Alliance         : Many groups gathered in one big one, also under
                   a name. (like the Independent). Sometimes they
                   produce big megademos or other productions by
                   joining forces.

Scene            : Gathering of active computer groups and individuals.   
                   Mostly elite coding groups or individuals. A
                   parallel world beside the normal computer circuit.

P.D.L.           : Public Domain Library ( Library filled with free       
                   or low cost software made by mostly non commercial 
                   individuals/groups ).
                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSP           : The Digital Signal Processor in the Falcon computer.   
                This processor can perform tasks without disturbing    
                the main-processor (68030). The DSP is especially       
                designed to process digital information like samples,  
                picture compression, speech recognition with incredible 
                speed. It can also do other things as well, although   
                it can't perform every task. The DSP is what makes the 
                Falcon special ! There are three versions of this chip
                a 16, 24 and 32 bit version. The Falcon has the special
                24 bits one.
                Otherwise known as the Motorola DSP56001, it can
                also perform very fast (pre)calculation of 3-D
                objects, more so than the main Motorola 68030 could
                ever manage - even very fast, almost realtime
                rendering is possible if your name is Douglas Little!
