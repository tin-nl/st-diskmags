This  little effort came from STe demo masters Inner Circuit  Explorers 
as  one  of the more pleasant surprises from the  Nordic  Atari  Show.. 
Having figured out that ICE were not immediately active on the  Falcon, 
it was nice to see them agin in this nicely done if rather short  debut 
effort here..

ICE starts off with some neato graphics,  a whirlpool picture/logo very 
heavy  on  the  truecolour,  then some new twists on the theme  of  3-D 
donutty objects..

These  ones  are textured,  but with a difference as a  shiny  metallic 
effect is used, and with a bit of lightsourcing thrown in too.. Dare we 
use the new soon to be lazy reviewers buzzword/cliche??

11th  September 1996..  Techie-Jargon & Associates are proud to present 
to an eager world,  'ENVIRONMENT MAPPING!'

Ron  Bollocks,  the chief developer of this new word picks up the story 
for Maggie..

"Well, it was touch and go for a time, as early prototypes of this word 
were seen in action at the Hamburg Symposium.. It was the case that Tat 
was  field-testing this word,  and a number of other useful phrases for 
us  at  the  time,  unfortunately most of the other words  and  phrases 
sounded  like Glaswegian drunks after five days with no proper rest  or 
relaxation,  but  'Environment  Mapping' survived the carnage,  and has 
been  refined  by our team into the quality new product  that  you  see 
in front of you today.."

Thank  you  Ron,  and  with that bit of accomplished padding out  of  a 
desperately thin review, we now return you back to the regular text..

Ahem, returning to the demo review, there follows a decent variation of 
the warp-tunnel effect, as this one seems to get more pixels in it than 
normal, a higher than normal res version of a common effect..

Another chrome doughnut,  this time in a blue study follows,  a picture 
and some greetings/credits text,  and that is it.. Unlike another intro 
by Therapy, this one finishes properly in time with the music..

Ratings..

Graphics:-  88%  -  ICE have usually come up  with  some  nice  looking 
screens  in the past,  and this has been carried over to the Falcon  as 
well..

Sonix:-  80%  - Nothing special,  but jaunty little tune that fits  the 
demo perfectly..

Gee-Whiz:- 79% - Shiny happy people, er, doughnuts!

Overall:-  82% - Good debut for the Falcon,  when are you going to do a 
big demo for the Falcon?
