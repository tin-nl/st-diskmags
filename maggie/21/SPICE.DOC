Cut  to  unlikely  looking girlie band dressed in a  variety  of  tight 
fitting clothes, on the brink of an even more unlikely chart hit..

"Yo! I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want.."

"So tell me what you want, what you really really want.."

"I  wanna Defender clone for the Falcon that is thoroughly updated  for 
the  1990's,  but retains all the hallmarks of a classic game that made 
it such a big hit the first time around!"

Anguished  screams from record companies A&R person who  realises  that 
they've signed the wrong sort of spice girl to their label and it's too 
late to do anything about it..

Alright  then,  'Spice'  is  the latest creation of Martin  Steen,  the 
almost as prolific as the Reservoir Gods Falcon game coder.. Martin has 
previously given us 'Pac-Them',  seen in Maggie 19, and also 'Ganymed', 
a  neat  looking Truecolour Asteroids clone for the Falcon  due  for  a 
review in here real soon as well..

Spice  is  a  reworking  of that  other  classic  vintage  arcade  game 
'Defender'  quite a good idea as Defender clones are surprisingly  thin 
on  the  ground for the Falcon..  Apart from Jeff  Minter's  commercial 
offering 'Llamazap', which is not really Defender in the pure classical 
sense,  but  merely  borrows certain gameplaying conventions  from  it, 
there is not a lot else out there..

Horizontal  bi-directional  blasting  action hunger  was  only  briefly 
satisfied  by Jeff Minter's Jaguar effort 'Defender 2000' which  got  a 
'mixed' reception and made us all wonder  if the great Yak had  finally 
blown it..  However, and not a minute too soon, we have Martin Steen to 
make amends to us, and Spice is the end result..

Starting it up results in nothing pleasant happening, then you remember 
Pac-Them  was  peculiar  in  its  choice  of  screen  mode,  it  needed 
Truecolour  mode  to  run (new people,  aren't you glad  you  read  the 
'Glossary' guide!) (Programmers, why not switch screen modes within the 
program instead of making us do all the slog?)

Attempt  II  leads to the real thing at last,  and a rolling drum  beat 
recognisable  as  the opening bars of Ultravox's 'Vienna',  one of  the 
very  greatest  tunes of all time,  ever,  introduces us gently to  the 
opening  credits..  An  explosive  ending  to this  gets  us  into  the 
attractive main menu screen, and we are ready to start the game..

I'm  sure that Martin has come up with a fantastic plot to justify  the 
game,  but it is in German, along with the rest of the instructions, so 
we'll just have to invent our own!!!

Popeye  the  Sailorman  was sitting moodily at home as  Olive  Oyl  was 
banging noisily around the kitchen, presently Olive spoke..

"Popeye,  stop  mooching around the house and make yourself useful,  go 
down to the supermarket and get me some cinnamon for this apple pie I'm 
making.."

Popeye, who liked Olive Oyl's home made apple pies very much, needed no 
further bidding,  and was off down to the supermarket in the family GTi 
convertible in an instant..

Popeye  arrived  shortly  at the Safeburys  hyper-mega  warehouse  food 
store..  Turning  the  corner  he collided with a downcast  and  dismal 
looking  retail  manager..  After the initial shock and  surprise,  the 
retail  manager,  otherwise  known as Dismal Kevin told Popeye  of  his 
predicament..

"Well  it's loike this,  one fifth scale models of real alien  invaders 
are attacking our condiments counter and making off with all the spices 
and we're not able to stop them..  We've got a fighter craft armed with 
the  latest rapid fire lasers and smart bombs,  but no-one in here  has 
passed their Top Gun driving test to fly it, do you know anyone who can 
fly it for us??"

Popeye,  thrilled  to be give the chance to recreate his superb  aerial 
combat  skills,  as most recently utilised in the "Popeye the Jedi  vs. 
Bluto  and the Bottom Bandit Invaders from Mars"  incident, immediately 
volunteered  his services..  With a last Brummie sounding expression of 
good  luck from Kev still ringing in his ears,  Popeye strapped himself 
in the cockpit and prepared to do battle with the spice-stealing  alien 
fiends.. 

The  first thing that Popeye noticed was the condiments counter  looked 
like a very simple vector representation of an alien planets surface at 
midnight and not very much like a supermarket at all,  the second thing 
that  the little buggers were already all over the place  stealing  the 
spices.. An unaccountable little chuckle from Popeye later, the sort of 
'her-her-her' noise that would get a normal person detained at a secure 
unit  for  a very long time,  and he started to wade in to the  hordes, 
hoping to emerge bloody and battered but ultimately able to give  Olive 
Oyl the cinnamon because he liked her home made apple pies very much..

Well its no worse than any of the other box blurb that has been written 
over the years!

Spice, is purely and simply Defender for the Falcon.. Martin has wisely 
not yielded to the temptation to add on extra features to turn it  into 
a  overblown nouveau-riche gothic nightmare of a game,  instead keeping 
the  gameplay very authentic to the original..  Even the fire button is 
not  auto-fire enabled,  as in the original arcade game which made it a 
test  of  stamina,  as  much as a test of everything  else..  Continual 
whacking  of the various buttons on the arcade cabinet also meant  that 
Defender cabinets and controls were some of the most ruggedly built  in 
the business.. 

A  major concession to this decade is the rather handy support  of  the 
Jaguar  joypad (including 'pause') which has all the functions  of  the 
game  in  very  easy  reach,  although  I would  take  issue  with  his 
positioning  of  the Smart Bomb and Hyperspace buttons,  the wrong  way 
around to my tastes..

The balance of gameplay is nicely done,  and just about right, in fact, 
very well done,  as Defender is a difficult one to get right.. The game 
oozes  playability  as the aliens twitch and buckle  under  your  laser 
blasts,  the  only thing that spoils it is the registration code  panel 
that  pops up after level five,  just when you are catching breath  for 
greater carnage.. 

Yes,  Spice  is  shareware,  and Martin had protected his investment by 
putting  the  code  protection  in..  Registration  is  a  not  totally 
unreasonable 30DM or equivalent,  although this involves a mail drop to 
Germany,  as  no  UK  registration scheme currently  exists  for  games 
support (any news on that one anybody?)

Graphically  it  is  on the tasteful side of  improved  with  carefully 
rendered alien ships and status panels, with some pretty planets in the 
background..  Sonically  acceptable with a funky background  soundtrack 
and  the right amounts of bangs and pops ingame too..  Anything else is 
simply not Defender!

Ratings..

Graphics:- 89% - High standard of presentation,  but ultimately remains 
faithful to the original..

Sonix:- 84% - Some decent soundtracks and effects..

Playability:-  92%  -  Very good interpretation of  classic  game..  No 
failed 'enhancements; to spoil it either..
