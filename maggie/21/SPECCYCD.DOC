Now  this  is one CD-ROM that makes the whole concept of  purchasing  a 
CD  drive  worthwhile..  Speccy  Sensations came from  that  oddest  of 
places,  an Amiga PD library,  or more precisely, a computer fair where 
they had set up their stall, and were selling this with other CD-ROMs.. 
The  willing  collaborator on this occasion was Ed Cleveland  who  left 
this  copy with me for an extended 'review' period whilst  visiting  me 
recently..
  
This  CD  comes  with emulator software  for  various  machines,  which 
immediately means that it is ok to run on this machine..  Any lingering 
doubts  were  swept  aside  as soon as we  tried  it  out..  There  are 
emulators  for  most  current computers from Amiga to  PC  and  ST  and 
Archimedes..  The  ST  version  being the tried  and  tested  Christian 
Gandler  program at version 2.07 which is compatible with higher  rated 
processors..  There  are several Amiga specific file areas and folders, 
looking  into  which does not yield any result,  but at the same  time, 
there are alphabetically arranged folders stuffed full of Speccy games!

Yes,  this  is  surely what we were after as there is a choice of  many 
hundreds of games,  almost certainly into the thousands,  most of which 
are  presented  in  easy to load 'Snapshot' format  (.SNA)..  With  the 
emulator running, it is just a matter of dipping into the CD to try out 
some  of  these long lost classics from the dawn of gaming  time..  The 
games will happily load from CD within the emulator, which uses its own 
DOS-like  directory  system,  which  saves  any  stress  on  hard  disk 
resources..  These  games  form the predominant part of this  disk,  of 
about 370 megabytes of data,  253 meg are game files,  although not all 
of them are necessarily .SNA files..

Think of a famous classic game title from the past, and you are sure to 
find  it on there..  Even think of some more deservedly obscure  titles 
that  are  long  forgotten,  they will probably be there  too..  Almost 
anything  that has gone into a fancy labelled cassette box at one  time 
or  another,  is  in  there,  it seems that only the  type-in  listings 
published  in  magazines of the period have been left out..  (And  even 
then, in one or two cases, I'm not so sure??)

But  are they any good?  Well that is a value judgement that is not the 
purpose of this review,  although I would say that, yes, some games are 
classics,  for example,  Jetpac,  Jetset Willy,  Alien 8, Skooldaze and 
several  others do stand the test of time..  3-D Starstrike regrettably 
bombed out the emulator,  and I mean real Atari TOS computer type bombs 
as  well,  and  there  are one or two games where I am  having  trouble 
figuring out why they were produced in the first place..

Eastenders  (the game of the television series) was written  by  Macsen 
software,  and  reputedly  got  the  money off  the  Welsh  Development 
Agency..  I looked closer out of horrified curiosity,  and discovered a 
very  early  naff icon driven adventure with simple  arcade  sequences, 
based,  yes,  on the television series of the game..  One thing that is 
very  much  part  of the televison series was  missing  from  the  game 
though,  where  were  all the people?  It seemed that Albert Square had 
been struck by alien abductors and carted off the cast,  leaving you to 
explore  the strange unreality of that gritty,  socially conscious soap 
opera world alone?

Another 'stunner', which could have only been a product of the times we 
were living in back then, was the 'Thompson Twins Adventure.' This is a 
graphical adventure,  controlled by a text command line,  and with some 
very  impressionistic images of that group..  A screenshot is  included 
for the disbelieving..
 
Those aside, we even have a folder full of Speccy demos, yes, even this 
primitive hardware has had demos written for it.. This *is* the subject 
of a separate review seen elsewhere in the mag..

If  you  are glutted out by the hordes of games on this disk  and  feel 
like a change,  then you can try out the pictures folder, which proudly 
presents  you  with  many images from the  Sinclair  era..  Of  obvious 
interest  are  some title screens,  various artwork from  cassette  box 
inlays,  scanned in a similar manner to our Lynx reviews,  even artwork 
from classic covers of Crash! magazine, and some huge JPEG files of the 
illustrated  cheat  solutions and maps that magazines  often  printed.. 
Various  PR  pictures  of the Sinclair machines,  and even  some  early 
portraits of Sir Clive himself, (less bald and funny shaped spectacles) 
are included here too..

Looking  around  the  disk a bit more,  you can find  some  interesting 
textual stuff on there,  even the odd FAQ file on this machine, and the 
later Sinclair QL as well..  

Ratings..

Content:-  96% - Absolutely faultless collection..  A winning formula.. 
More than enough even for the most hardened Speccy addict..

Ease  of Access:- 89% - Good,  all files can be loaded off the CD  from 
the  emulator,  easy  to follow structure as well..  Some parts machine 
specific (Amiga) and innaccessible, but not the important stuff..

Overall:- 94% - As I said at the beginning, sufficient justification to 
get a CD-ROM drive on its own.. (Assuming you like old games that is!)

Legality point!
Technically,  the copyrights to the various games on this disk do still 
belong  to  the  authors,   and  surviving  software  companies,  where 
applicable.. These were distributed as commercial games originally, and 
have  not  been  released into the public domain as far  as  we  know.. 

Therefore,  most of the contents of this CD are illegal, if you were to 
interpret the situation literally..  However, according to the blurb on 
the  disk,  most of the software companies surviving from that era  (US 
Gold  was  one name mentioned) have accepted in  principle  that  these 
games  can  be  freely distributed as long as there is  no  attempt  to 
profit  from  resale  or attempts to redistribute on  a  large  scale.. 
Nothing has been confirmed in writing,  and the legal situation is very 
open.. A crackdown is very unlikely at this very late stage though..

Availability point..
There is one company advertising heavily in Amiga Format, who are

Epic Marketing
139 Victoria Road
Swindon 

Phone 0500 131486 (freephone) for details..

They  are currently advertising the latest edition of this disk,  which 
is called 'The Speccy CD 1996' (v 1.1) at œ17.99 - I don't know if this 
version is multi-platform compatible or not, so you may have to ask..

The  version under review was called 'Speccy Sensations II' which  most 
assuredly  works ok on my Falcon,  and should be alright with any other 
Atari machine with a suitable CD ROM drive..

Anyway, I suppose I'd better give Ed his disk back now!
