            Info on Two New Atari Viruses: Pharaoh & Carpe Diem

From: Richard Karsmakers (cronos@worldaccess.nl)

Below you will find descriptions of two new viruses that have  appeared 
on  the  Atari platform,  analysed and included in the "Ultimate  Virus 
Killer" version 6.9 in the past few days. This has been posted earlier, 
but  some  people  have requested this info to be  re-posted.  So  here 
goes...

Name:  Official  name of the virus.  When several different versions of 
one  virus  exist,  their  difference is indicated  by  one  additional 
character - "A" for the earliest or most widely spread version, "B" for 
the next, etc.

Type:  The  description  of  the virus fitting the  most  common  virus 
classification.

Discovery  date:  The  date when the virus was earliest reported to  be 
seen.   If  the  discoverer  is known,  his/her name is  added  between 
brackets.

Virus  can copy to drive(s):  This indicates to which drives the  virus 
can copy itself.   "Current drive" implies that the virus copies to the 
drive that is currently in se of the ones listed.

Virus  attaches itself to:  Here it is mentioned which system vector(s) 
the  virus  attaches  itself to.   When indicated to  be  'undocumented 
reset-proof',  this  refers to the undocumented method for programs  to 
become reset-resistant through the $12123456 method.

Disks can be immunized against it: Informs of whether a virus cannot be 
immunized  against,  or  whether it can be immunized against.   In  the 
latter  case,  it  is indicated how one can immunize against  it.   The 
format   of   the  immunization  method   is:   Offset   (hexadecimal), 
Byte/Word/Longword, and the hexadecimal value expected at that offset.

Disks can be immunized with UVK:  Indicates whether or not a particular 
virus'  immunization  was capable of being including in  the  "Ultimate 
Virus Killer" advanced immunization method.

What  can  happen:   Lists the effect that the virus is  programmed  to 
cause to occur.

When does that happen: Specifies when the above will happen (ahem).

Reset-proof:  Tells  you  whether or not the virus can survive  a  warm 
reset.

Can copy to hard disk: Tells you...er...well...this is pretty obvious, 
actually.

Remarks: Here all the other things worth mentioning are summed up.

Virus #94 

Name: Pharaoh Virus. 

Type: Memory-resident reset-proof bootsector call virus. 

Discovery date: Spring 1996. 

Virus can copy to drive(s): Current floppy drive (A or B). 

Virus attaches itself to:   Hdv_bpb,  resvector and undocumented reset-
resistant. 

Disks can be immunized against it:  Yes, though it is not known exactly 
how.  Immunizable  with  UVK:  Very  likely.  It copies to none of  the 
immunized disks I tried to have it infect. 

What can happen:  Noise is made, as well as a high frequency sound. 

When does that happen: After five copies have been made. 

Resetproof: Yes. 

Can copy to harddisk: No.

Remark:   A  particularly  devious virus,  which uses two 32-bit random 
values  to  double-encrypt itself.  It can also start at  13  different 
locations in the bootsector,  and the initial instruction can be one of 
2048 different ones. This results in a total of (2^3)  * (2^32)  * 13 * 
2048  different  versions that it can make of itself  (when  multiplied 
that's 4.9112611*10^23...).  It is also MS-DOS mimicking.

It  was sent to me anonymously,  with an Arnhem (Netherlands) postmark. 
The virus is Falcon-compatible but does not copy to high density disks. 
As it fiddles around with BPB FAT values,  programs such as "FCopy" and 
"Knife ST" may fail to operate properly on infected disks because  they 
may find the manipulated BPB values hard to swallow.

It is also known as "The Curse Virus" or "Klatwa Virus" (this is Polish 
for  "Curse",  and  was used to make it appear as if it was written  in 
Poland).  Disks  once  infected with the "Pharaoh Virus" will never  be 
completely  regular  because  of the virus  having  rearranged  various 
values in FAT and BPB. Copy all files you need to retain off them, then 
perform a soft or hard format, and copy the files back.


Virus #95 

Name: Carpe Diem Virus. 

Type:  Memory-resident  reset-proof bootsector virus originating from a 
Trojan Horse. 

Discovery date: Spring 1996. 

Virus can copy to drive(s): Current floppy drive (A or B). 

Virus  attaches  itself to:   Hdv_bpb,  resvector,  vbl and undocumented 
reset-resistant. 

Disks can be immunized against it: No. 

Immunizable with UVK: No. 

What  can  happen:   The text "BO[BJOF" appears at the top left of  the 
screen.  Your computer can crash.   When does that happen:  The text is 
displayed 2048 vertical blanks after system start-up (on a 50 Hz colour 
monitor  that  would be after about 40 seconds).   The crash  can  (and 
will) happen any time after that.

Resetproof: Yes. 

Can  copy  to  harddisk:  Yes,  but only in a file form  ("~.PRG",  see 
below).

Remark:   This virus has an interesting history.  It originally came in 
a  ZIP  archive  called "CARPDIEM.ZIP".   It contained  a  file  called 
"CARPDIEM.PRG"  (normally 91,750 bytes in size) and a small  text  file 
with  the contents "Sease the day,  and run this great falcon  enhanced 
game!!"  (sic).   Upon  running  this 'game',  nothing would appear  to 
happen  (though a quick eye would see the text "Ruth Marcs  Development 
Inc.  (Dedicated  to the memory of Lucky Lady)" flicking on and off the 
top of the screen).   The 'game' wouldn't run, and the desktop would be 
displayed  again.  The  virus,  however,  would have installed itself in 
memory  and  on  the current floppy disk,  and would have  written  the 
"~.PRG"  file   (see below) in C:\AUTO\.   Useless,  the "CARPDIEM.ZIP" 
file  and  related items would be thrown away.  So this virus  actually 
arose  from what is commonly known as a "Trojan Horse".   Even if you'd 
get  rid  of all virus occurrences on floppy disks,  the  "~.PRG"  file 
would reinstall it[self] on floppy every time you reboot.  Likewise,the 
floppy version of the virus would reinstall the "~.PRG" file!  So it is 
quite  impossible  to  let  the "Ultimate  Virus  Killer"  on  its  own 
completely get rid of the virus for you.

HOW TO PROPERLY GET RID OF THE "CARPE DIEM VIRUS". 

You have to remember that, on an infected system, there are a potential 
number of three copies of the virus:   One on your floppy disk,  one in 
the hard drive C:\AUTO\ folder and one in memory.

These are the steps: 

1)  First  you have to reboot without a disk,  or with a disk  that  is 
guaranteed  to be virus free.   Turn your system off for half a minute. 
This  will get rid of two of the possible three copies of the virus  in 
your  system (in memory and on floppy).   Make sure the floppy disk  is 
write-protected.

2)  Turn  your computer back on.   Press [CONTROL] during  the  booting 
process. This way - at least with the Atari hard disk driver - the hard 
disk  will  be  installed  and accessible,  but  the  programs  in  the 
\AUTO\folder  will  *not* be executed.  If you have another  hard  disk 
driver   installed,   simply  try  to  bypass  hard  disk  installation 
altogether   (pressing   [CONTROL],   [LEFT  SHIFT]   and   [ALTERNATE] 
simultaneously  usually ought to do the job) and install the hard  disk 
driver  from  floppy.   This,  too,  will not install any of the \AUTO\ 
folder  programs.  If you have a Claus Brod hard disk driver installed, 
all you need to do is simply boot off another partition, like D:.

3)  Now  you  have to get rid of a file called "~.PRG"  in  the  \AUTO\ 
folder of hard disk partition C:.   It can't  be located anywhere else. 
Unfortunately,  the  file  is hidden.   That means you can't delete  it 
until  you  can  see   it,  and you can't normally see  it.  There  are 
probably quite a few ways to delete it:

i) With "GfA Basic".   Go into "direct mode",  "chdrive" to drive C and 
"chdir" to the \AUTO\ folder.   Now,  with "files", you can display the 
full  directory,  including  hidden files.   You can now use the "kill" 
command to delete "~.prg".

ii)  With the alternative file selector "Selectric".  Turn the "display 
hidden"  option on,  and smply delete the file from "Selectric" itself. 
"Selectric"  can be started from the desktop,  without needing to start 
it  from  the  AUTO  folder.   You might have to  switch  to  a  higher 
resolution first, though.

iii)   In the absence of the two options mentioned above,  you can  use 
any  command line interpreter (such as "COMMAND.PRG").   These may  not 
allow you to delete the file,  but this is no problem. Using  the "ren" 
command you can rename the file,  for example to "file.xxx".  This will 
not  remove  the  file  from the \AUTO\  folder,  but  will  render  it 
completely harmless - after all, only programs with the "prg" extension 
are executed when the \AUTO\ folder is invoked.

4)  Now,  with  a clean and uninfected system,  you can get rid of  all 
occurrences of the virus on all your floppies with the "Ultimate  Virus 
Killer".

IMPORTANT:   The  floppy-based  version  of the "Carpe Diem  Virus"  is 
recognised  without  further ado.   To recognize the  tiny  (1024-byte) 
"~.PRG" file from the link virus check (both the "CARPDIEM.PRG"  mother 
file and the "~.PRG" file are recognised,  regardless of what name they 
might  currently  have) you have to set the lowest limit  of  the  link 
virus  check to 1 Kb (this will cause only files below 1 Kb not  to  be 
scanned).  By default, this value is set to 3 Kb, which would cause the 
"~.PRG"  file to be skipped.   The lowest link virus check limit can be 
altered  by  means of the "UVK.CNF" file (see  the  appropriate  manual 
section).   A  line containing ".001" (without the quotes) added at the 
end of the file (using a text editor, for example) will do the job.
