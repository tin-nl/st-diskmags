                            -----------------------

       - a behind the scenes account of the creation of a Falcon game -

                    ( words by Mr. Pink of Reservoir Gods )


        In the five years I  owned  my  STFM  I  rarely  felt the need to create
games. Sure, I  dabbled  about  in  STOS  and  GFA  but  never  created anything
substantial. The nearest I  came  was  the  still  unreleased  "Big Ron's Soccer
Manager", which is  unfortunately  anchored  in  the  glory  days  of my beloved
Sheffield Wednesday FC. I also drew the graphics, including the footballer's leg
which everyone mistakes for a hoover.

        The ST scene was so vibrant, there  was  so much being released, so many
games and demos I was happy to  be  a  passive  consumer and enjoy the fruits of
others. But when I bought my Falcon I realised the situation was different.

        The year was 1993.  Atari  had  seen  the  future  and  it  was a 32 bit
computer with amazing graphics and sound  capabilities. And it looked remarkably
like an ST. And I wanted one. And due to the marvels of market economics and the
postal service, several hundred coins were exchanged for a lump of plastic. This
arrived in the obligatory cardboard box  one summer morning. After marvelling at
a couple of nice demos ("Terminal  Fuckup", Doug Little's efforts, erm, "Lines")
I turned my  attention  to  the  games  side  of  things  (or "the entertainment
software experience" as Atari would like use to call it.)

        After two minutes  of  playing  Atari's  bundled  free  "games"  (in the
loosest possible sense of the word)  I  decided  there was room for improvement.
There weren't a great deal  of  Falcon  developers  at  the  time,  and a lot of
companies had already shelved their Falcon  projects  to  work on the Jaguar. If
the Falcon was to stay flying it needed all  the help it could get. I decided to
form a game making crew and write some decent software for my favourite bird.

        One of my favourite games at the  time was Match-It on the Syntax Terror
demo by Delta Force. Ripley and I were  hooked  on it and we fought over my STFM
to play it. This was a  bit  stupid  seeing  as  we  had a spanking new computer
sitting unused. A light bulb appeared above my  head  "race - i got an idea!" We
decided to convert this game to the Falcon.

        At the time I had  virtually  no  documentation  about the Falcon. I had
some  very  brief  docs  listing  some   of  the  new  hardware  addresses  with
explanations in French, and something similar  in  German, but I couldn't really
follow it.

        I called Atari  UK  with  the  intention  of  purchasing  some developer
information for the Falcon. Big mistake. The first person I spoke didn't seem to
know what a Falcon was.  I  was  informed  that  I  would  have  to speak to the
enigmatic "Alistar Bodin", but no he wasn't there at the moment.

        After a week of trying to get hold of Mr. Bodin, I was finally told "Mr.
Bodin will be away for the rest of the month as he is pregnant". At this point I
decided to give up. Cliches involving "blood" and "stone" came to mind.

        I still wasn't sure how  to  access  the  extended graphics modes of the
Falcon. I had done some poking around  with  some registers and got overscan and
interlace, but I had not  figured  out  how  to  fully set resolution and colour
mode. I hacked about in the XBIOS but the setscreen call seemed very convoluted.
Fortunately, help was at hand.

        I received a game preview that was  going to answer my prayers. The game
was "Vreath" by the Independent, and all  the preview did was display a picture,
and that was precisely all I needed.  I  dissassembled  the small bit of code in
the preview and quickly assertained which  routine set the screen and "borrowed"
it. Hurrah! At last I could  set  the  screen in True Colour mode, unfortunately
only in 384 x 240 mode in RGB. Still, better than nothing.

        I had Devpac and a fair knowledge of 68000 so I started work on the game
logic. I didn't really know much about the extra 68030 instructions so I decided
it was best just to avoid them as much as possible.

        Ripley and Sparhead 3 -  the  graphics  artists  -  were  in a far worse
position than me. We  wanted  True  Colour  graphics  and  at  the time the only
package capable of creating  16-bit  colour  was  HiSoft god-awful "True Paint",
possibly the worst graphics package  ever  created.  I heard nothing but moaning
from Ripley during the months we  worked  on  this  game.  Plus at that time she
didn't have a Falcon and had to do  all  her graphics on my machine which slowed
down development.

        I quickly realised that  there  was  a  desperate  need  for a good true
colour art  package,  so  ideas  for  the  creation  of  God-Paint  were already
beginning to formulate.

        As much as I loved "Match-It", I felt it would benefit from the addition
an extra dimension. I am a big fan  of  multiplayer games, a human player has an
unpredictability a computer can never recreate.  Plus it is much more satisfying
to trounce a mate than a CPU. We  decided Match-It would have a split screen two
player mode.

        We would also have two different  tile  sets.  SH3 drew one based on the
traditional Mah-jong set as used in Match-It. Ripley, on the other hand, created
an original set.

        SH3 drew a series of excellent intro pictures. As I soon realised it was
impractial to fade true colour  pictures  on  the  Falcon  (this was before true
colour fading had been invented!) I  coded  a  fade between routine that bore an
unfortunate resemblence to the STOS "appear" command.

        We also decided it would be  a  good  idea  to  have a saving high score
table as this would give you some incentive to go for bigger and bigger scores.

        I can't remember  exactly  when  we  decided  on  the  name "Tautology",
although I would guess it was in  the  later  stages of development. It seemed a
fitting name, we didn't want to  call  this  game "Match-It Falcon" or something
similarly dull.

        One of the final additions to the  game  was the music. I found a Falcon
tracker routine by CYLAB of TPN which I used. I rummaged around for the smallest
tuneful module I could find.

        On its completion we wanted as many Falcon owners as possible to see the
game and we sent to about a dozen scene names. Not many wrote back! Looking back
I am not really surprised,  the  game  itself  wasn't  very good. It didn't work
properly on VGA, you could only  play  it  on  joystick  - it didn't support any
other control method. As this type of game is  best suited to a mouse this was a
serious omission. The general presentation was  quite  poor. We knew we could do
better.

        We got a very  long  e-mail  from  Richard  Karsmakers detailing all the
faults with Tautology, and all the  areas  where  it could be improved. I wasn't
happy with the code so I  decided  to  recode  the whole thing from scratch, add
some great new graphics  and  a  spanking  new  tune  from  SH3.  This was to be
Tautology II and the dawning of a new  age of games from the Reservoir Gods. But
this was to come later...

        The  feedback  we  got  from  Tautology   was  Brian  Eno-esque  in  its
minimalism. We got one postcard. Yes, one. This was from Dan of Lazer and it was
very encouraging and it made us more determined to do a lot better next time.

        To be honest I don't play Tautology anymore. Since we wrote Tautology II
the original has seemed somewhat redundant. I view it with slight affection, but
also with some embarassment as its faults  and  bugs are so self evident. But as
the packed file is only 80k, it is worth its weight in bytes.

        Tautology one was finally released in April 1994.

        It would be one year before its successor appeared.
