                     - by New Beat Development -


        Willie the adventurer is a platform game for the Atari Falcon.
And it looks absolutely  gorgeous.  Imagine  the legendary Jaguar game
"Rayman" making appearance on your  favourite  32-bit computer and you
will have some idea of how good Willie is.

        New Beat Development are a Swedish  group  and they seem to be
following in the footsteps of the  most  famouse  Swedes of them all -
"The Carebears". Yes,  Willie  is  also  reminiscent  of TCB's classic
"Enchanted Land".

        The Willie The Adventurer preview begins with some text giving
you the credits. You  are  then  asked  to  chose your control method:
Joypad or Keyboard. There is no Joystick  support - this seems to be a
trend sweeping games at the moment  as the limitations of the joystick
become more and more evident.

        After we have picked our  control  method  we are treated to a
nice  New  Beat  developments  logo  which  is  displayed  in  a  high
resolution (interlace). This fades off and we are into the game!

        An immaculatey drawn  foreground  appears  depicting  a jungle
type scene. No, it isn't Goldie  and his Metalheads mates playing down
at "Speed", nor it is Tony McCarrol and his "Natural Gas" project, but
an environment laden with palm trees and wooden huts.

        The screen is set into  320  x  240  in  256 colours. It looks
bigger than this as New Beat  use  cinemascope to achieve a widescreen
type format -  the  pixels  stretch  across  both  the  left and right
borders.

        The main sprite looks similar to  the  dude in Rayman.  It has
no arms or legs, its feet  and  hands  appear to float around it. This
gives the animators a lot  more  flexibility.  The character is one of
the cutest to appear on the Falcon.

        There are some very neat touches in this game. If you fall off
a platform, the air appears to push up Willie's T-Shirt displaying his
belly button in all  its  glory.  If  you  hang  around without moving
Willie for a couple of second he  will  turn  and wave at you and call
"hello!". After a few more seconds he will get frustrated and urge you
to "c'mon!".

        At the moment, not  much  of  the  game  has been implemented.
There are no other  sprites  apart  from  Willie.  You can explore the
small level but you won't meet anyone else. Your jumping abilities are
quite extroadinary and the longer you  hold  down space the higher you
jump.

        The scrolling in the game is  marvellous. It uses the Falcon's
hardware scrolling capabilities to move  everything  about in a silkly
smooth way. As well as the  colourful scrolling foreground there are 2
background layers  of  parralax  scrolling.  These  are  just  2 plane
graphics  blitted  behind  the  main   graphics  but  they  work  very
effectively. Everything runs at a sparkling  50 frames per second, but
it remains to be scene if  this  frame  rate will be retained once all
the other sprites have also to be displayed.

        The music  also  deserves  a  mention.  It  is  excellent with
crystal clear samples and good composition.  The  main tune is a jolly
up-tempo affair that really suits  the  mood  of the game. The jumping
samples and the snatches of speech from Willie also work well.

        There is  also  a  smart  options  menu  which  when activated
plunges from the sky. On this  you  can  alter the volume of the music
and the sound effects and also toggle surround sound and interpolation
on and off.

        Willie the Adventurer looks set to  be one of the great Falcon
games. The presentation is immaculate. The graphics are fantastic. The
music is ace. We await the completed version with bated breath.
