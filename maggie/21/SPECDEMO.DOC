In  an  interview in Maggie 20,  the comment was made that  a  computer 
without  a  demo  scene  was either totally dead  and  buried,  or  too 
primitive  in  the hardware sense to support one,  a 48k  Spectrum  not 
quite  managing  to run a 96ktro..  Well sorry Ripley,  you're wrong on 
this  one,  although an extended trawl through the demos folder on  the 
Speccy  Sensations  CD-ROM (see review elsewhere) made one  wonder  why 
some people bothered..

After  ploughing through a selection of mute 128K sound demos,  (why no 
emulator  for  128K?) ultra-crackly sample demos,  and  other  assorted 
junk,  we've  come  up  with a round dozen of some of  the  best  ones, 
catering for a wide variety of effects and styles, and showing that the 
humble 48k Sinclair Spectrum can quite happily mix it with higher  spec 
machines, well, up to a point anyway..

These  demos  were  a mixture of the familiar,  and  slightly  strange, 
sometimes  effects took an overlong time to materialise like  early  ST 
efforts,  and  you realise with a bump how much tastes and expectations 
have changed over the years..  Your average impatient modern demo freak 
would  expect  to  see a dozen effects in the time it  would  take  the 
Speccy to complete just one.. As I said, makes you think..   

NB. All demos were run on the Christian Gandler Spectrum emulator v2.07 
(TT version) on a standard 16mhz Falcon..

Here they are..

Nine Ties..
A small one to start with,  some funny little onscreen fireworks..  Not 
really one of the greats..

Cybernoids..
A  Polish group gives us a single screen anti Atari demo..  It consists 
of  a rolling twisty top scroller,  and a rather descriptive picture of 
the object of their loathing in the centre..  A battered ST with an axe 
embedded in it is strung up on a gallows.. Nearby, the severed heads of 
of several Atari owners sit atop spikes in dumb repose..

Beruska..
A  good example of 'design' on the speccy,  a large and well drawn mono 
font to start, a slick vertical scroller to introduce the thing, then a 
brief  but well done cartoon animation of a man squashing a  bug..  The 
sound effects in 48K complement the scene very well too..

The Lords 'Big Bang' menu..
A multiscreen effort, selected from a menu, part of which probably 128k 
only,  but  notable  for  an  elastic stretching  logo,  another  small 
animation demo, and scrollers..

Clef Demo by Hacker Chris..
Another  one of those pesky 128k music demos from this  prolific  coder 
but  also quite strong from a point of view of what is  onscreen..  Too 
many  of the demos and intros seen used the 128k machine to  produce  a 
music  demo,  and  wimp  out  on  the rest  of  it..  There  are  three 
scrolltexts, two of which are actually running over the background logo 
without producing any of the notorious attribute clash, and indeed give 
the  impression that the scrolltexts are transparent,  as you can still 
see  the graphics below the text!  Some form of cheating must surely be 
involved,  but  this  is  a  screen  which might  not  look  like  much 
elsewhere, but seems to manage things that the speccy ought not be able 
to do..  Oh,  yes,  there are indicator bars at the bottom for the non-
existent for 48k machines music..

Crazy demo..
One of my personal favourites of this little round up..  One of the top 
notch efforts for presentation..  A smart starter screen gives way to a 
very  smart  centre screen logo,  making best use of the speccy  colour 
limitations  and very well drawn indeed with a colour  layering  effect 
that avoids the attribute clash.. A initially ordinary scroller starts, 
but gets leftward scrolling colourshock effects, then a smooth and fast 
colourblock  scroller underneath it completes the screen..  The  centre 
logo changes to other equally well drawn pictures, and to look at, this 
demo  is remarkably similar to the recently reviewed Cream  music  demo 
for  the  ST in general layout..  There is sound with this,  but as  so 
often,  a  128K  machine  with  the Yamaha bastard  cousin  of  the  ST 
soundchip is needed to hear it..

Fantaslyka by Frank Frazetta..
Another  brilliant cover picture of life on an alien planet  giving  an 
illusion of lots of colours.. A credits and greets text follows, but as 
soon as it tries to access the main part,  it crashes as it notices the 
lack of 128k-ness about this emulator..

Garfield Demo (for shame C64!)
A Goodish 48k sound demo, wringing the utmost from the appallingly crap 
spectrum  beep sound with a selection of tunes that almost sound  three 
channel..  A  picture  of  the fat cat himself dominates  the  screen.. 
('Hades Nebula' tune recommended..)

Ghaza Demo..
This comes as parts 1 and 2 and is probably the strangest of the  lot.. 
Both are cartoon slideshows of anti-Israeli propaganda..  The first one 
is  just  sad and plain nasty,  the second one has a bit of a sense  of 
humour  at  least..  Technically  well done,  but very dubious  message 
indeed..

Lyra..
A nice single screen effort,  monochrome, so 'design' with a good piccy 
of Robocop in the middle,  a grid pattern going leftwards, and a twisty 
scroller the other way..

The Lords Collected Works part II..
Another 'goodie' with at least one effect never attempted on any  other 
machine..  This  uses  ripped graphics from the game 'Alien-8' to  good 
effect  in the background..  In the forefront there is an isometric 3-D 
lego-brick  style scroller which also ripples up and down..  This  runs 
quite slowly and can only be seen to best effect on an emulator capable 
of  bettering the speed of the original article..  Mike Noyce's Pentium 
PC  is  able to run it *stupidly* fast,  and the actual content of  the 
scrolltext turns out to be quite short..  At its heart, this is another 
music  demo,  but a 48k one,  with similar tune quality to the Garfield 
demo, all selectable from the keyboard..

Ugly Demo..
A little demo which is the most ST-ish in feel out of all of them.. One 
little and one very big scroller which fills half the screen and run at 
different speeds.. At the bottom half of the screen, there is a geniune 
sineous  scroller running with a starfield and to finish off  there  is 
also  a user-definable distorting logo in there as well!!  This runs  a 
little  unsteadily,  but  that may be down to the emulator..  Certainly 
feels like a production you might see done by the Swedish scene in  the 
early  days  on the ST,  and a suitable note upon which to finish  this 
mini-tour of the strange world of ZX Spectrum demos..
