
 Interview with Si Gardner, who is a member of the Wessex Atari Group 
                   (and one of the users of  42BBS!)
 
Can you give us a brief run-down of your life so far (where you were 
born, which schools you attended, etc.) ?

My  life  so  far  goes something like  this:   Born  in  a  Portsmouth 
Hospital.  I've  spent  all my life so far living in Hambledon a  small 
village  near Waterlooville in Hants.  A small village that would  sink 
out of existence  but for 2 points 1) it's in the Doomsday book of  old 
and  2)  (a  fact   that every Hambledonian  will  tell  you)  its  the 
birthplace  of  modern   cricket,  forget Lords  Hambledon's  its  real 
birthplace.  Started school in 1976 (can you work out roughly how old I 
am?) at the age of 5.

My first school was Hambledon first (really?  Yes!), then progressed to 
Denmead  middle (in the next village to mine) and finally ended up   in 
Cowplain  Comprehensive,  about 5 miles from my home.   Left school and 
decided  to  take an apprenticeship as an Electrician.  Finished  up  a  
fully  fledged  Electrician  and left my wires hanging  in  1994  after  
getting totally bored and annoyed with two of my employers.  I've since  
started  work as a machine operator in a local soft drinks  firm,  less  
money but better hours and better atmosphere.

 
Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems  have you 
owned?

Well I stared with an Atari really back in 1982,  I was given an  Atari 
2600  games  console  as a Christmas present.  I say I  was  given  but  
really  it was between my brother and myself.  A few years later we had  
grown  tired of "Games" so we managed to convince my parents to get  us  
a 600XL with 1010 tape deck,  this was quickly upgraded a year later to  
a  800XL.  Over  the next few years we added disk drives  and  printers  
until one day a friends dad bought a new 520ST (not to be confused with 
an STFM, for this machine had no Floppy and no Modulator for the TV), I  
was hooked,  I waited a few years but knew that one day I would have an 
ST.  My chance came in August 1989.  I'd just got a decent pay increase 
as  an apprentice and wanted to buy something like "a NEW computer!  An 
ST no less!".

My 1040STFM bought from Evesham Micros has seen some time and it was on 
this that I first discovered Comms.  Although not mine (my brother  and 
I  have  always  shared computers in the past...  NOT!) We did  buy  an  
(ahem!) Amiga A500,  this been added to and changed to a A1500, and now  
its in the next generation with an A1200.   Although not all the Amigas  
are  at  home we do have all of them still,  in fact my  brother  (poor 
fool)   still uses the A1500 and A1200 regularly.  I've since bought  a 
Falcon   (just over a year ago),  but still have my ST (now upgraded to 
4megs),   a  65XE  with disk drive and tape deck,  and somewhere in the 
roof is a  7600 games console that I bought new for 10.  (From Compo ?? 
- ED)  Question is am I an Atari freak?  Yes,  I am. I also have a Lynx 
handheld   unit,  a  Sega  Gamegear,  Amiga CD32,  Playstation,  and I'm 
currently borrowing my mates 486DX4 100 PC.  So I'm a little spoilt for 
choice at home. :)

Oh I forgot, I've also had a Sega Megadrive. In fact this is one of the 
few items that I've  sold in the way of computers.


How long have you been an Atari owner?

This  has already been answered above.  I've had an Atari (in  whatever  
form) since 1982.

You are a member of the Falcon FacTT File.  Why did you join ??

Hmmm.  why? I think it was a case of finding out what was about for the  
Falcon  that  made me join.  I'd just got the Falcon and was  a  little  
miffed  to find nearly all the games on the ST wouldn't work  (although  
to be honest I was rapidly going off games at the time).

I sent off for FFF and FOG (Falcon Owners Group) at the same time.  FFF 
was the first to reply and I thought the idea of the factfile   listing 
was a good one.  Find something you want to look at and give  someone a 
call to ask their opinion.  Brilliant!  Shame it never worked  that way 
in the end.

 
What do you think of the Atari scene in general??

I feel the Atari scene is dead. A mate told me back in the last days of 
the  Spectrum  computer that he was "No longer a  Spectrum  user.  I've  
superseded  that stage to become an ENTHUSIAST!" its comical  but  true  
about us Atarians now.

Every  magazine is devoted to PC,  MAC and to a lesser degree now (same 
situation  as  us now you see) with the Amiga.  With the loss of the  2  
main  magazines for the Atari,  we've finally sunk to the realms of has  
beens.  However  hopefully with the start of the new "Atari  Computing"  
magazine there is still hope for us all. 


Which  demo,  in  your opinion,  is the best you've seen on either  the 
Falcon or ST??

A  subject  that although I now little of what goes on in  the  way  of  
coding, I still love to enjoy. For me the best Falcon demo is WARUM, it 
may  not be the best demo visually or sound wise,  but its just  got... 
something good about it. (It's a Lazer demo ?? - ED)

 
What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc)

It was dead,  most of the shops had the attitude "Atari?  Is that  a PC 
sound  blaster  card?".  There  was no user groups at all.  But  a  few  
months back a name appeared called  W.A.G. (Wessex Atari Group), it was  
started  by  some  local guys and it seems to have got off  on  a  good  
footing.  I  was  there at the first meeting and have been to  all  the  
meetings so far.

 
Which computer show(s) do you have fond memories of?

Can't  remember  the  date but definitely my first Atari  show  at  the  
Novotel  in Hammersmith London has to rate high on the list.  Being  my  
first I was overcome by what I saw.  Computers, printers, so many disks  
and  people all I can say is AMAZING.  Also I'd have to say the one  at  
Alexandra  Palace a few years later was a good example of a good  show.  
Seeing  the  line of people waiting to get in I was a  little  annoyed,  
until  someone  said that ticket holders could go straight in.  As  you  
might guess I had a ticket.  :) Seeing some poor guy on a stall selling  
disks  made  me laugh,  one man trying hopelessly to serve at least  50 
people,  its  a wonder he had any stock left with the amount of  people  
just grabbing a box of 10 disks and walking away without paying.

 
What is your opinion of diskzines on the Atari scene??  (ie Maggie,  ST 
Plus, etc)

I'll be honest here.  I do look at the disk based magazines like Maggie  
and  AtariPhile  as they do have interesting reviews  and  points  that  
need to be addressed and expressed.  They can be good reading too,  but 
I'm more of a comms and paper person myself.  I get most of the  info I 
want from messages in Comms.

 
Which is your favourite web site ?? (Give URLs if you can)

I think that of all the web sites that I visit I spend most of my  time 
just   browsing  through  Yellow  Pages   (http:\\www.yell.co.uk)   and  
selecting  a subject on Yahoo (http:\\www.yahoo.com) and seeing what  I 
can find. For FTP I tend to use ftp.cnam.fr and ftp.toad.com for Falcon  
demos and other programs.

 
What is your favourite TV show ??

Star Trek (all the new stuff TNG,  DS9,  Voyager) and Babylon 5. As you 
can see I can't specify one single program, I'm just a bit of a  sci-fi 
nut.

 
And your worst TV programme ??

Once  again this is difficult as there are too many.  Basically I  hate 
all soaps. I think the story lines are naff.

 
What is your favourite movie of all time??

Definitely  Brandon Lee in the Crow.  I try to watch this film at least  
once a month on video.   It just totally freaks me out how they managed  
to complete this film without him. For those who don't know Brandon Lee  
died during the making of this film. 
(He's  not the only one who enjoyed this movie ...  it is a good   one.  
Watch out for the sequel coming soon !! - Felice)

 
What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen??

Spies  like us.  I can honestly say I hated this film.  I saw it on its 
day of release and what a letdown. All the best parts had been  used as 
trailers.  The same can be said for Dumb and Dumber  (this film  should 
be renamed to crap and crappier).

 
Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies??

Actor is simple Arnie! I'm an Arnie buff, I don't think he's made a bad 
film  recently.   Terminator  is just simply one of a kind.  T2,  Twins, 
Eraser,  True Lies all very good films.  For anyone who hasn't  seen it 
get down to the movies and watch Eraser NOW!

Actress Meg Ryan?  no. Liz Hurley? Nah. For me Michelle Pfieffer has to 
win  hands down for her portrayal of Catwoman in Batman 2.  She is  one  
sexy lady.

 
Who  or  what do you find everyone else seems to like,  that the  media  
seems  to hype up,  but which you personally loathe intensly ??   (this 
can include Camilla Parker Bowles !! - ED)

In the PC world I hate Windows '95.  Even though everyone though it was 
crap  (I think the comment went something like Windows '95 - MAC   '89) 
every PC owner now has a copy of this poxy software. (I don't ... !!ED)

What a load of hype!

 
You  are a user of 42BBS,  the home of the Falcon FacTT File.   What do 
you like about 42BBS that keeps you logging on so much ??

Oooo this is going to hurt to say this.  I don't log on the BBS much at  
all.  I use 42BBS as a mail access point for NeST (the mail network for 
Ataris).  I  was  after a new mail host for NeST and seeing 42  BBS  is  
fairly  local  I decided to ask Colin for access.  On the Odd  occasion  
that I do log on, its just another BBS to me. (sorry Colin!), I've been 
in  comms  for a while now and  to be honest once you've seen  one  BBS  
then you've seen them all.

Lets face it what is a BBS? A BBS is a system on the end of a telephone 
line  where  you  can get messages and Programs for  next  to  nothing.  
There  are even way of bypassing that if you become hooked  on  message  
writing.
 
Some  words,  people and places to react to ...  (please be as frank as 
you like)

Piracy
Its a fair statement to say that we don't believe in piracy but lets be 
honest somewhere in most peoples collection of disks is some piece   of 
copied software. 

I'm  the  first to admit I used to copy games when I had my ST.  I  now 
look   back  and think I shouldn't have don't that,  but to  be  honest 
again  if  I was in the same position now as I was back then I'd  still 
be  doing   this.  Still,  I've  grown  a bit now,  and no  longer  get 
involved.
 
Censorship
I  think  this is bad.  All censorship is wrong in my view.  Its an old  
adage but if you don't like something on the TV you always have an  off 
button. Same goes for all (to a degree) censorship in the UK. There may 
be  no  off button but you can still look away,  cover your  ears  etc. 
There  is  a case for censoring violence.  If its too graphic then  why 
elaborate  on  it.  The US has a good idea,  if its graphic then rather 
than show all the images just cut out the most dramatic and add a  good 
voice-over.  If  its  portrayed  correctly  then  it  needn't  be  OTT.  

Dunblane
Sorry for saying this but the bastard got away too easy.  He managed to 
kill  himself  rather than risk getting caught.  The bastard  shouldn't  
have  had the opportunity to get as far as he did.  If the services had  
done  the job right this wanker wouldn't have been walking the  street.  

Kevin Beardsworth (no, this is not a mistype!!)
Kev's  a really nice bloke.  I've only met him once but I've had reason 
to  call  him on several occasions.  He's always there when I've had  a  
problem  with  Linux/68k even though we still never managed to  get  it  
working :(
 
Wessex Atari Group and the members of it
Its  a nice little group of people.  I was there at its first  meeting,  
and  I hope to be there every time.  The guys are friendly and  helpful 
and  now  that its getting going the ideas about what we  want  to  see 
shown  (one  of  the main ideas was to show  people  things  about  the 
computer   that you were scared of intimidated to try) this  month  was 
MIDI night. I've looked into MIDI but found it totally unsuccessful but 
now  I've seen what can be done with the right equipment and  help  I'm 
definitely going  to give it ago again.
 
The infamous British tabloid newspapers (Daily Mail, et al)
I'm  a Sun man myself and between you and me (hehehe) I only  read  the  
cartoons,  most  of  the news I want to learn about comes on a 21  inch  
screen :)
 
Twister (the movie)
GOOD FILM, VERY GOOD FILM! If I was asked (and I have been) as to which 
film to see between Twister and Independence Day,  I'd say see Twister. 
The  tornado sequences are extremely clever.  I'd definitely go and see 
this film again, unlike Independence Day.
 
Divine Brown (Hugh Grant's infamous 'mate'!)
Sorry but she's definitely not my idea of a dream date.
 
Trainspotting (the movie)
Never seen it.

 
If  we  were ever to visit you (ie,  myself and Chris  Holland),  where  
would you take us for a night out??

Difficult one...  If you wanted to see a film Portsmouth has a 6 screen 
cinema  complex which isn't that bad.  There are several local pubs  if 
you  wanted a drink,  or alternatively you can always party down one of 
the  local night-clubs.

But  for  sure  you couldn't leave without sampling  a  Mick's.  Mick's 
burger bar on top of Portsdown hill :) .  The hill overlooks Portsmouth 
and on a clear night you can easily see the Isle of Widget (opps  Sorry 
White  :) ) and Scumhampton (arrrgh Southampton).  But its the burgers! 
My brother  has a couple of mates in Wales and whenever they come  down 
to  visit  its always the same question,   "Is Mick's still up  on  the 
hill? When are we going?" I think it's  reputation speaks for itself.

 
Who is your favourite musical group?

I  don't  have  a favourite group or singer,  but I do  have  a  varied  
selection that I like,  such as  Madness,  A-ha, Roxette, Queen to name  
but a few.

 
Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet??

Sorry Liam fans but I hate OASIS! What a bunch of tarts (as my mate  
would say).

 
Who is your favourite music singer ??

I  would have to say that I like the late Freddie Mercury of  Queen.  I  
think that his voice was great!

 
Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection?

I  normally just choose a compilation album and listen to that.  I find  
it's easier than digging out 10 CDs and getting bored with each one  in 
turn.

There now follows a commercial break ...
