Top Computer Tips From PC-land!  It has become apparent that the PC is
the computer of choice for  idiots,  the  depressing  thing is that it
could become the ONLY choice for the  rest  of us if no-one gets their
act together on a cheap  home  computer  soon.  Anyway after reading a
copy of Micromart, and the rather naive standard of articles within, I
was inspired to note down  a  few tips a typical more-money-than-sense
PC user would write in to a magazine  with. I know we all had to start
somewhere, but the  amount  of  these  know-nothing  idiots  who think
merely owning a PC makes  them  into  some  kind of superior life form
really gets on my nerves.  So, to  set the scene, just imagine you are
leafing  through  a  copy  of  a  PC  magazine  in  WH  Smiths  for  a
moment......

LETTER OF THE MONTH

Dear PC Brilliant,  Thanks for the  magazine, it is worth every penny.
In fact, œ5.50 is too little to pay  for it- I demand you increase the
price now. I was extremely pleased with your free CD-ROM on the cover,
the price seems to have gone  up  by œ1.50 since you started including
these, but it certainly is worth it for a free CD-ROM. Thanks also for
the free trial of CompuOnMicroLineNet  internet  access. All I did was
give my credit card details over the phone to them and they gave me my
free trial! Brilliant! I  have  enclosed  some  handy  tips for new PC
users below, I hope other PC Brilliant readers will find them useful.

1. Never put strawberry jam into the floppy disk drive. I have noticed
that if you put strawberry jam  into  the disk drive it stops working,
but since I found this  out,  I  do  it  much less often now. (Perhaps
apricot jam is a safer alternative?)

2. Instead of running an  "install"  program, you can actually install
software yourself by performing a complicated procedure called "coping
some files off the disk", but this is only recommended for experts.

3. When playing a  game,  try  moving  the  joystick about. Many games
contain special features  that  can  only  be  accessed  by moving the
joystick about and pressing the fire buttons.

4. Never let anyone who can program  computers near your PC. They will
only try and put a virus on  it  or even worse, "hack" into Windows 95
Explorer and set off nuclear  missiles  in  the  Pentagon like in that
documentary film from some years  ago  "War  Games".   I hope you find
these useful, and once again, thanks for PC Brilliant!
