Since the dawn of time  man  has  been  fascinated  by fire. It was an
otherwordly creation, magical, mystical. It  was worshipped and feared
in equal measure.

Over the centuries fire has  inspired  artists, authors, poets and pop
stars. Most noticablly was John Lydon  recent chant of "Burn Hollywood
Burn" on Leftfield's 'Open Up'.

Coders are not culturally ignorant. They recognised the growing demand
for a realistic fire effect to appear on demos. And in a puff of smoke
it appeared.

The effect itself is quite  straightforward.  Each pixel is calculated
from an average of pixels below  it.  This  value  is used to access a
colour table that  ranges  from  white,  through  reds  and oranges to
black. The actual palette  of  this  table  is  very  important in the
illusion of creating fire.

Martin Steen is best known  as  the  creator  of  such Falcon games as
"PacThem", "Ganymed" & "Spice"  but  he  also  been  known to use demo
effects to enhance the presentation of his games.

Flames begins with some introductory  text  appearing along the bottom
of the screen:

"Flames For Falcon030"

It announces. This text is  then  burnt  and  the fades burning up the
screen.

"68030 Version by Martin Steen"

Although strictly  speaking  this  is  coded  in  C  not  raw assembly
language.

"Inspired by Fire by Jare of VangelSTeam"

I'm not sure who this dude is, but perhaps he came up with the concept
of fire.

The author then credits his girlfriend  before  we are into the effect
proper.

A huge  pire  builds  up  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  and  burns
impressively. It is like Guy  Fawkes  night come early, except without
the toffee apples and screaming brats.

At the top of the screen is  the  text again informing us that this is
"Flames for Falcon030" in case we  hadn't realised what the flickering
red and white  display  was  supposed  to  represent,  and also hadn't
realised that our grey ST-like computer was actually a Falcon.

As is often the case with  this  sort  of averaging technique, we have
some static colour bands at the left and right of the main fire.

Behind the text at the  top  we  have  a  nice  rippling blue effect -
perhaps this is water or steam.

This is a good introduction to the  world of demo fire effects. It has
been since done better - notably  in  Spirits'  amazing 4Ktro - but we
have to give Martin credit for  being  one  of the pioneers (or should
that be pire-neers!).
