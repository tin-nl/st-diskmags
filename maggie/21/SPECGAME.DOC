ALIEN 8
Ultimate 1984
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston, Cursor
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : As Maintenence  Droid  8,  you  are  aboard  a starship which is
slowing for its long-awaited  rendezvous.  Unfortunately, the ship has
been invaded  by  a  group  of  rather  unpleasant  aliens  which have
deactivated the timer circuits in  the cryogenic chambers, leaving the
ship's crew still frozen. It's your job to reconnect the timers before
the ship gets to its destination.

GAMEPLAY : The timer circuits appear as geometric shapes with plugs on
the end, scattered  around  the  spaceship's  129  rooms.  A cryogenic
chamber  has only one socket, each of which demands a specific type of
plug - you  must work out which  type  of plug goes with which type of
socket. As well  as this, you  must  overcome  the other hazards - the
aliens, the  moving  and  dissolving  blocks,  and  the  ship's  auto-
defences, which include  mines,  vicious  spikes  and lethally-charged
pyramids... The mines can  be   cleared  by  using a multi-directional
robot, controlled by standing on  a   compass  pad  in the mined room,
which can be used to blow them up.

COMMENTS : "Compelling and exciting to play ... poses many strategic
and thinking problems as well as arcade action."
RATING : 95% (CRASH #15, April 1985)

NOW : Graphically speaking, Alien 8 is probably the finest of
Ultimate's isometric 3D games. It wasn't as great a landmark as its
predecessor, KNIGHT LORE, but it is a much more polished game. Still a
challenging and enjoyable game!

AUF WIEDERSEHEN MONTY
Gremlin 1987
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Cursor, Kempston
`---------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : Having escaped from  prison  to  a  hideaway in Gibraltar, Monty
Mole finds that  he's  not  safe  from  the  attentions  of Intermole,
theinternational  crime  fighting  organisation.   Monty's  only  hope
ofsalvation  lies  on   a   Greek   island,   but   only   if  he  can
acquiresufficient monies to buy it. Before  he can do that, Monty must
pass through Europe, performing  at  least  one  task  in  each of its
nations.

GAMEPLAY : There are 80 platform-filled screens in all. As you explore
them, you will come across items to  help him to complete the required
tasks. Such items must be picked  up  (by walking into them) and taken
to the right place before they can  be  used.  Up to four items can be
carried at any one time, with  these  displayed  at the bottom left of
the screen.

Money is gathered in the form of Eurocheques, or earned whenever Monty
completes a task. Points are also  scored  by picking up objects. Your
account is shown at the bottom of the screen. Air tickets let you into
the Air Terminals. From  here  you  can  fly  to  another location and
straight into a dog-fight with the Intermole air force. Further points
can be gained by shearing off the enemy planes' tailplanes.

Only when every task in the  game has been completed, every Eurocheque
collected and Monty's  Swiss  bank  account  number  acquired, can the
money be called safe and the island purchased.

COMMENTS : "A fine continuation of the long-standing Monty Mole
theme."
RATING : 85% (CRASH #40, May 1987)

NOW : Quite a nice game, but rather simple by modern standards.

BUGABOO THE FLEA
Quicksilva 1983
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : For some inexplicable reason,  a  flea called Bugaboo has fallen
into a deep gorge, and it's  your  job  to  get  him out as quickly as
possible.

GAMEPLAY : The controls are incredibly simple - hop left or hop right.
At the botton of the screen  is  a  bar indicating the strength of the
hop. When you press the desired  direction  key, Bugaboo turns in that
direction. You release the key when you have got what you think is the
right strength of jump. A hazard  you  will  have  to face is a yellow
dragon which, after  a  few  minutes,  enters  and  eats  you. You can
however start again immediately  but the dragon will appear at shorter
and shorter intervals, giving you less and less time.

COMMENTS : "It's a delight to play and mind-blowingly frustrating."
RATING : 92% (CRASH #1, April 1984)

NOW : Simple, rather  garish  graphics  and  simple gameplay - despite
this, BUGABOO is actually rather good. It's another one of those 8-bit
classics with an indefinable appeal...

DARK STAR
Design Design 1984
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston, Cursor

N.B: This game is not really playable with a joystick...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : Armed only with a LIAR starfighter, you must liberate the galaxy
from domination by the Empire. To  achieve  your aim you must wipe out
all the enemy's military  centres  on  the  planets within your galaxy
(these are shown  in  green  in  the  Tactical  Sector  Map). The game
difficulty setting will determine the  degree  to which the Empire has
extended its sphere of influence throughout the galaxy.

GAMEPLAY : The Dark Star galaxy  is  divided  into  a  16 x 16 grid of
sectors in the galactic plain. The  LIAR's battle computer generates a
real-time display on your  screen  which  shows  all  activity in your
immediate vicinity. As well as showing enemy ships and their missiles,
this display will also show  energy  concentrations  and Warp Gates to
hyperspace. Energy concentrations are shown as pulsating blue squares;
flying through these  will  enable  the  LIAR  to  increase its shield
energy and so maintain its deflectors.

HYPERSPACE : Moving from one sector to  another requires you to make a
transition to hysperspace. This is done by finding a set of Warp Gates
(which your battle computer sees  and  displays as four yellow squares
changing shape as the Gates open  and  close) and then flying the LIAR
into one of these whilst it is open.  The four gates are arranged in a
North, South, East, West fashion -  you  can thus select the direction
you wish to move within  the  grid,  by flying through the appropriate
gate. If the LIAR is in a sector  at  the edge of the grid, one of the
gates will be missing, or two if the LIAR is in a corner sector.

The route through hyperspace is  mapped  out  as a rectangular tunnel,
down which you must guide the  LIAR.  Travelling outside of the tunnel
puts a heavy strain on the  engines  and uses much energy, so accurate
flying is essential!

PLANETS : There are a number of planets in the Dark Star galaxy. These
can be investigated further by  flying  down onto their surfaces. This
is done by flying  directly  up  to  a  planet,  as  if on a collision
course.  You  will  then  automatically  smash  through  the  planet's
defensive shields and land on the  surface  near an enemy base (if the
planet is occupied).

BASES : The surface of an  occupied  planet  will be defended by enemy
forces firing anti-aircraft missiles  from  tall  towers. These towers
can be destroyed by being  shot  at.  Certain  areas of the planet are
defended by force fields which will  damage the LIAR is flown through.
However, there are holes in these fields at the North, South, East and
West entrances to  the  bases  which  your  computer  will  detect and
display as rectangles. If  you  fly  through  these  no energy will be
lost.

The enemy bases are hidden in the centre of a ring of defences and are
themselves protected by three extra-tough towers. These bases generate
the planetary defence shields, which  must  be rendered inoperative by
destroying all the bases on  a  planet.  Without  doing this, the LIAR
cannot leave the planet!

Pressing 1 whilst on the surface of  a planet will cause your computer
to display a tactical map of  the surface, showing defences, bases and
fuel dumps. The LIAR's position  and  direction  are marked by a white
arrow. Bases are shown  as  concentric  rectangles, defences as shaded
areas (intensity  shows  difficulty),  fuel  dumps  as  blue  dots and
spaceports as magenta rectangles.

You may leave  a  planet's  surface  (after  destroying  all the enemy
bases) by flying with  maximum  speed  and  maximum  climb at the same
time.

Fuel dumps on the surface consist of a number of energy concentrations
held in force fields  generated  by  the  surrounding  towers. To gain
extra energy, guide the LIAR through these  as you would in space, but
beware of the towers' fire.

Enemy spaceports are defended by both towers and enemy ships. They are
fairly difficult targets, but  it  is  not  necessary to destroy these
before leaving a planet.

COMMENTS : "Excellent shoot-em-up, certainly the fastest."
RATING : 89% (CRASH #11, December 1984)

NOW : Although it's fairly  simple,  Dark  Star  is quite a neat game,
with some very fast 3D graphics.

THE HOBBIT
Melbourne House 1982
=======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard

N.B : It is advisable to play this game at the maximum speed possible
on your machine - this will speed up parsing and graphics drawing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : Gandalf the wizard has talked you - Bilbo Baggins, the eponymous
hobbit - into  entering  a  new  and  exciting  adventure  to help out
Thorin, the dwarf. Your mission is  to  seek out the evil dragon Smaug
and return the treasure he hoards back  to  your home and place it for
safe keeping in the chest. As a secondary mission, you must look after
Thorin and protect him.

GAMEPLAY : The Hobbit is an  adventure  game... it is played much like
any other adventure, and has a  pretty  good  parser (for its time, at
any rate).

COMMENTS : "It is  one  of  the  most  complex  games for the Sinclair
machine that I have yet seen."   (Sinclair User, March 1983!)

NOW : By modern standards,  The  Hobbit  has  a  lot  of faults and is
pretty primitive -  spotting  the  bugs  is  probably  as  much fun as
actually  playing  the  game.  However,  it  is  an  all-time  classic
adventure game and no  adventurer  should  think  himself worthy until
he's got out of the famous Goblin's Dungeon!
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 SPECIAL COMMANDS : WAIT        - allows the passage of time
                    @           - repeats the last command

                    NOPRINT     - disables the PRINT function
                    SCORE       - gives the current score
                    PAUSE       - suspends the game (it is played in
                                 real-time) until any key is pressed.

JACK THE NIPPER
Gremlin 1986
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston, Cursor
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : Jack the Nipper is  the  epitome of naughtiness - the naughtiest
kid in town. Now he's trying to  set a record for naughtiness. Can you
ensure that he does it without getting busted?

GAMEPLAY : JTN has a  fair  amount  of  arcade adventure elements - to
bump up the  Naughtyometer's  rating  you'll  need  to perform certain
tasks. There are about twenty of  these,  but they're not that easy to
do; quite apart from working out  what  to  do  and  how to do it, the
various other characters around the town  will do their best to hinder
you. Parents and shopkeepers will  do  their  best  to catch Jack, and
ghosts will also pester him -  although  these can be exorcised with a
well-aimed peashooter shot.

If Jack collides with another  character,  he'll get a thrashing which
will increase his nappy rash rating (shown  at the bottom right of the
screen). Too much rash and  he'll  be  "self-spanked off" (a la Andrew
Beckwith...) and lose a life.

LEMMINGS DEMO
Psygnosis 1991
=======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : Your task, in this classic "save-em-up", is to rescue the small,
hapless and terminally stupid  Lemmings  from  certain  death. In this
demo, you get to play four actual levels from the game.

GAMEPLAY : The start of  the  level  informs  you  of how many must be
saved to move on to the next level. The Lemmings drop from a trapdooor
set at the top of  the  screen  and  must  make  it safely to the exit
within a time limit. If they  hit  a  solid object they bounce off and
retrace their steps, if they fall  too  far they splatter, and if they
fall into water, they drown.

They can be controlled by  clicking  on  one  of  the ten icons ranged
across the bottom of the  screen  and  then  clicking  on a Lemming to
"give" him that  function.  Only  a  certain  number  of  each type of
function is available, so you will need to think carefully about which
 to use, where and when...

These are the functions of each icon (from left to right):

1. MINUS        - decreases the amount of Lemmings being released.

2. PLUS         - increases the amount being released.

3. CLIMBER      - allows a Lemming to climb a sheer face.

4. FLOATER      - gives a Lemming an umbrella so that he can
                  fall without being splattered.

5. BOMBER       - makes a Lemming explode after a five
                  second countdown!

6. BLOCKER      - turns a Lemming into a "traffic warden" and
                  prevents other Lemmings from passing him. Can
                  only be got rid of by turning him into a bomber.

7. BUILDER      - makes a Lemming build a bridge across a
                  hazard. He'll only build a fairly short
                  stretch though.

8. BASHER       - makes the Lemming tunnel horizontally through an
                  obstacle.

9. MINER        - makes the Lemming tunnel diagonally
                  downwards through an obstacle or the floor.

10. DIGGER      - makes the Lemming dig vertically downwards.

11. PAWS MODE   - pawses the game (sic).

12. NUKE        - blows up all the Lemmings. Use if you've made
                  a spectacular mess of the level...

======================================================================
THE LORDS OF MIDNIGHT
Beyond 1984
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : The aim of the game is simple: overthrow the evil witchking
Doomdark and restore peace to the land of Midnight.

GAMEPLAY : At the  beginning  of  the  game,  the player controls four
characters: Luxor the Moonprince, his  son  Morkin, Corleth the Feyand
Rorthron the Wise. The computer  takes the role of Doomdark,commanding
250,000 Iceguard warriors and the dreaded  Ice Fear which saps armies'
courage and may even cause them to desert to Doomdark's side. Although
the odds aren't good, it's possible  not  only to defeat Doomdark, but
to wipe out the entire Iceguard.

The Free have two distinct advantages in the form of Luxor and Morkin.
As a Moonprince Luxor own  the  Moon  Ring  which  lends him powers of
vision and command. These allow  him  to  command and look through the
eyes of the characters on  his  side.  Some characters are individuals
and some control large armies.  Other  characters  can be recruited by
using already loyal characters.  In  a  relatively  short spce of time
it's possible to amass quite a large army.

The Moon Ring also acts as a shield against the Ice Fear. The closer a
character or army is  to  Luxor,  the  less  will  be the demoralising
effect of the Ice Fear.  There's  only  one disadvantage: Doomdark can
sense the  warmth  of  the  Moon  Ring  so  always  knows  the precise
whereabouts of the wearer.

Morkin in the only character in Midnight who is able to totally resist
the influence  of  the  Ice  Fear,  thus  enabling  him  to  undertake
dangerous missions in the heart  of Doomdark's territory without being
demoralised.

DEFEATING DOOMDARK :  There  are  two  ways  to  defeat  Doomdark. The
firstis to destroy the Ice Crown, the source of Doomdark's power. This
can only be achieved by Morkin. The  Ice Crown is located at the Tower
of Doom near  Doomdark's  stronghold  of  Ushgarak  on  the  Plains of
Despair. This task is more like  an  adventure and places the emphasis
on stealth rather than military might.

The second is to actually seize the Citadel of Ushgarak. This requires
many lords, complete  with  armies,  to  be  recruited. The full-scale
military campaign is the more difficult  and time-consuming of the two
tasks. However, the flexibility  of  LOM  allows  the player to adjust
strategies at a moment's notice.

For Doomdark to win, he must  accomplish  two of three goals. Firstly,
kill Morkin - as long as Morkin is alive the game continues. Secondly,
kill Luxor or  thirdly,  capture  the  southern  Citadel of Xajorkith,
Luxor's base. Should Luxor be  killed,  the  player loses control over
all  other   recruited   characters   by   finding   the   Moon  Ring.
Unfortunately, as  soon  as  Morkin  puts  on  the  Ring,  Doomdark is
immediately aware of his whereabouts,  thus  making  the quest for the
Ice Crown virtually impossible.

HOW LOM WORKS : LOM boasts 4,000 locations and 32,000 different views.
The screen displays the  eye  view  from  the  location of the current
character in the direction they're  facing. Whenever a character moves
to a different location or  changes  the direction they're facing, the
screen updates to show the new view.

The game proceeds by day or night. During the day you can move any or
all of the characters under your  control,  along with any armies they
control. The distance a character can move depends on a combination of
the type of terrain they're  moving  across, their general health plus
whether they are walking or riding.

Whenever a character moves N, S, E  or  W, they move a distance of one
league (3 miles). If they move diagonally (NE, SE, SW, NW) they travel
1.4 leagues (about 5  miles).  Therefore  moving diagonally takes more
time and leaves less hours of daylight for the rest of their journey.

Once a character has used all their daylight hours or engaged one of
Doomdark's armies in battle, the screen goes dark, indicating night.
Except under  exceptional  circumstances,  that  character  cannot  do
anything until the next day. Once  you've moved all the characters you
wish, press the NIGHT key.  The  outcome  of  any  battles is shown at
dawn.

THE PEOPLE OF MIDNIGHT :  The  people  of  Midnight can be broken down
into three basic categories:  the  Foul,  the  Free  and  the Fey. The
Foulconsist of Doomdark's Iceguard riders and warriors. There are some
250,000 of them and none can be recruited to your cause.

There are numerous Lords of the  Free. Generally, these can be located
at citadels in the south of Midnight  and  at some keeps. Any of these
Lords can be recruited by  Luxor  and  usually  by any other recruited
Lord. The Lords recruited from keeps  have smaller armies and are less
useful in fights than those from Citadels.

The Fey live exclusively in the forests; they don't like to meddle in
the affair of the Free  but  don't  have  any great love for Doomdark.
They can really only be rallied by other Fey, such as Corleth. The Fey
can move through  forests  far  faster  than  any  other characters in
Midnight. It's also worth noting that  Doomdark's armies tend to avoid
venturing into forests.

Though Doomdark holds the north of Midnight, there are a few Lords who
remain Free in that region, but they  have to be recruited early on in
the game otherwise Doomdark will  overrun  them. Of these, Lord Dreams
(a Fey) is one of the more useful, as is Lord Gloom (a Free Lord).

Other recruitable characters who can help overthrow Doomdark include
another one of the Wise, a dragon, a Skulkrin and the Utarg of Utarg.
The latter is not aligned to  either  side,  being a true neutral, but
can be persuaded to fight against  Doomdark  by Luxor. However, if the
Ice Fear gets too strong he may desert and join the enemy.

Finally, Midnight is not a  land  without  its fair share of dangerous
wild animals. Wolves, dragons and wild  Skulkrin can sometimes get the
better of the lone traveller.

GETTING STARTED : The game begins  at  the  Tower  of the Moon, in the
Forest of Shadows (western  Midnight).  It's  best  to  start the game
trying to achieve both objectives,  in  case  one strategy goes wrong.
The best way for Morkin to  approach  the  Tower  of Doom is along the
western edge of the map. Farflame  the  Dragon and Fawkrin the Skulrin
can aid Morkin in his quest  and  both  of  them  can be found in this
region. Farflame can be found at the  Tower of Dodrak in the Mountains
of Dodrak, while Fawkrin is usually to  be  found in the Plains of the
Moon (a good place to look  is  Moon  Henge). It's also worth going to
the Forest of Lothoril to  recruit  Lord  Lotheril,  who can provide a
small army to protect Morkin.

The final journey to the Tower of  Doom  must be made by Morkin alone,
as any armies that  follow  him  risk  being  spotted  by Doomdark and
putting the mission in jeopardy. When  controlling Morkin, it's a good
idea to avoid fighting anything, to avoid putting Morkin in danger.

When embarking on the strategy  of  conquest,  it's best to recruit as
many Lords and big armies as  possible. It's impossible to defend each
citadel and keep against Doomdark, so  for  much  of the game you will
have to let him capture  them.  However,  this  also  has the bonus of
splitting up and weakening  Doomdark's  army  as  it becomes dispersed
over a wide area.

The best strategy for recruiting  a  large  number of Lords and armies
quickly is to split  up  your  characters  and  send them in different
directions.  As  you  recruit   more   characters   to  recruit  other
characters. In this way,  you  can  sweep  the  south  of Midnight for
characters and armies in a matter of days.

When you feel  you've  recruited  enough  Lords  and  armies, choose a
rendezvous point (a good one is  the  Citadel of Ithrorn on the Plains
of Ithril). Rest all your  characters  and  then  push on to Ushgarak,
making sure that you rest frequently so that they're in top condition.

If you're after a quick  military  victory,  Xajorkith will have to be
abandoned. A sizeable force is needed  to  defend it, and leaving such
an army behind would seriously weaken your effectiveness when fighting
through to Ushgarak.  However,  as  Doomdark  takes  more  and more of
Midnight, the Ice Fear grows stronger.

Once you've assembled all  your  armies,  spend some time reorganising
them so that the bravest  Lords  have  the biggest armies. Once you're
completely rested, you're ready  for  the  final  assault on Doomdark.
Good luck - you'll need lots of it.

 FEATURES OF THE LANDSCAPE:

 Army           A friendly army will offer no hindrance to the
                 traveller but a hostile army should be avoided or
                 engaged in battle.

 Cavern         Can provide shelter from the weather or enemy, but
                 it may have already done so for fouler creatures.

 Citadel        A strongly fortified city which may harbour friendly
                 or enemy forces. Storming a citadel is a hard task.

 Down           Slow down travellers slighly and may hide unseen
                 dangers ahead.

 Forest         Home of the magical Fey. Movement through a forest
                 slows down all but the Fey.

 Frozen Wastes  These surround the land of Midnight. They cannot be
                 crossed by anybody.

 Henge          Possess strange powers which may help or hinder an
                 army.

 Keep           The fortress of a minor Lord. They cannot resist a
                 determined assault from an enemy for very long.

 Lake           Often magical, these can have powers to revive and
                 heal those who oppose Doomdark.

 Lith           Ancient standing stones, often with strange magical
                 powers.

 Mountains      Moving across a range of mountains takes many hours
                 and leaves you exhausted.

 Ruin           Abandoned fortresses of long-forgotten wars. May
                 harbour dark creatures or lost treasures.

 Snowhall       Large structures which offer shelter to hundreds if
                 need be.

 Tower          The refuges of the wise. Although impregnable, help
                 may be sought at these - it may not always be granted
                 though.

 Village        Can offer warmth and shelter if the people prove
                 friendly.

COMMENTS : "One of the greatest games ever"
RATING : 10/10 (CRASH #7, August 1984)

NOW : Although 10 years old by  now,  still a superb game. The last in
the Midnight trilogy, Eye of the Moon,  is due out in mid-1994, and it
looks _very_ nice -  graphically  it  is  like a ground-based Comanche
Maximum  Overkill,  but  better.  LOM,   though,  can  still  cut  the
mustard...

AIM : Charlemagne "Charlie" Fotheringham-Grunes, apprentice saviour of
 the universe, has been asked to find the source of mysterious signals
 from the moon - a large black  Monolith (just like "2001"!). Like any
hero should, he  promptly  volunteers  for  the  task  of  finding the
Monolith...

GAMEPLAY : To get to the  Monolith,  Charlie  needs to find eight keys
or "alchiems", which look rather  like  crystals. The game begins with
you wandering around on the lunar  surface near some mole holes. Don't
fall down a hole; instead wait for a mole to pop up and stand on it to
descend into the caves beneath the moon.

The moon is, it seems, infested with various strange monsters (such as
teddy bears on springs??). Most  are  merely a nuisance, blocking your
way, but some are definitely harmful.  You can however destroy them by
jumping on them and so squashing them.  As well as this, you will have
to cope with muggers - astronauts  in  red  spacesuits whose aim is to
rob you of your alchiems.

The task of finding the eight  alchiems  is complicated by the size of
the cavern system; not all of the access routes are clear, so you will
have to use  your  friendly  mole  to  make  extra  tunnels.  The game
includes features such  as  whirlwinds  that  teleport  you around the
caverns, which might make exploring  easier or alternatively leave you
somewhere you would rather not be. Huge, deep shafts also exist, which
can mean the certain loss of a life  if you fall down one - unless you
are lucky and find that the one you just fell into has a very powerful
up-draft.

Extra lives can also be found scattered around, which is just as well.
Your vital signs  are  continuously  ticking  away,  your current life
force is steadily draining and your  movements slow with every beating
you take. When you get  an  extra  life  you  will also obtain gravity
sticks, which render muggers harmless  and  also cause all monsters in
the immediate area to fall to the bottom of the cavern.

niches at each side of the screen.  Each can of insecticide is colour-
coded with reference to the insects;  hence, red insecticide will kill
red insects, and so on. Using  the  wrong insecticide will merely stun
an insect. Bonus objects pop up  as  well, which give you extra points

AIM : Floating in nether  space,  a  recently discovered dimension, is
Hangworld, a strange place of platforms  and ramps suspended above the
void. You have been selected to  explore  it, controlling GERALD - the
Gyroscopic ExploRAtion Landing Device.

GAMEPLAY : Your task is simply to  explore the whole of Hangworld, all
385 screens worth! However, you  have  two  big problems: a time limit
and a shortage of fuel. Due to budget limits, you have been given only
a small amount of energy and  you'll  have  to find energy crystals on
Hangworld to replenish your supply. This  is easier said than done, as
moving GERALD consumes precious  energy;  you'll  have  to learn to be
frugal.

GERALD has a handy built-in  turbo  unit,  which allows you to greatly
increase speed in  order  to  jump  gaps.  This  takes  up  more fuel,
however...  GERALD can  also  morph  between  a  ball,  tetrahedron or
gyroscope, each of which has its  own particular quirks of control and
may be suitable for different occasions.

Within Hangworld you'll find a lift  system, left behind by an extinct
civilisation. The system comprises of a  number of lift activator pads
bearing a symbol; move onto one of these and all the pads bearing that
symbol are  activated.  Only  two  different  kinds  of  lift  can  be
activated at once, and a scanner  on  the bottom left-hand side of the
screen shows  which types of lift are currently operating.

Another on-screen window  shows  how  many  sections  remain unmapped.
Pressing the map key shows  you  the  sections  of Hangworld that have
already been mapped out. The  other  windows  show  your time and your
energy respectively. If you drop  off  the  edge of Hangworld into the
void, you will lose large chunk of time  -  so it is a good idea to be
as accurate as possible...

THE SENTINEL
Firebird 1987
======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Cursor, Kempston

NOTE : It is strongly recommended that  you  play this game at a speed
setting of at least 150% of the Spectrum.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : The object of the game is to absorb the Sentinel and replace him
as ruler of the landscape.  Once  achieved,  you may hyperspace into a
new world to begin the struggle afresh.

GAMEPLAY : Once you have  loaded  the  game,  the title screen will be
displayed. Press any key and you  will  be  asked to input a landscape
number from 0000 to 9999. After  you have entered the landscape number
and hit return, you  will  be  prompted  for  an  8-digit secret entry
code,unless you choose landscape 0000, which does not require an entry
code.

After a  short  delay  you  will  be  shown  an  aerial  view  of  the
selectedlandscape which shows the  relative  positions of the Sentinel
(standing on the tower - he may  be  a little difficult to spot, owing
to the monochrome graphics!) and  the  Sentries,  if any. Pressing any
key will take  you  onto  the  landscape's  surface.  The Sentinel and
sentries will be inactive  until  you  expend  or  absorb energy. This
allows you to  have  a  look  around  and  plan  your  assault  on the
Sentinel.

ABSORPTION  :  Once  activated,  the   Sentinel  and  Sentries  slowly
rotate,scanning the landscape for  squares  which  contain more than 1
unit of energy. This means you!  The various objects contain different
amounts of energy:

 TREE     - 1 unit      - Will not be absorbed by Sentinel/Sentry
 BOULDER  - 2 units
 ROBOT    - 3 units       (you!)
 SENTINEL - 4 units     }  Will not be
 SENTRY   - 4 units     }  absorbed by
 MEANIE   - 1 unit      }  Sentinel/Sentry

If they can see a square with more than 1 unit of energy, the Sentinel
or Sentry will reduce the energy to  1  unit  by absorbing 1 unit at a
time and creating  a  Tree  at  some  random  point  on the landscape.
Therefore a Robot will be reduced  to  a  Boulder,  and a Boulder to a
Tree.

The total amount of energy in  a  landscape  remains constant, so if a
unit of your energy is absorbed, a  Tree will be randomly place on the
landscape.

CREATION : You can also  absorb  and  create  objects.  You do this by
turning on your sights and centering  them on the square surface below
the object to be absorbed  or  created.  Boulders,  however, act as an
extension of the square surface and the sights should thus be aimed at
the side of the  Boulder.  Boulders  can  be  stacked  and have things
placed on top of them. This means that you can gain height by creating
a stack of  Boulders  with  a  Robot  on  top,  and  then transferring
yourself to that Robot. (See  moving,  below). From those high vantage
points, you can  absorb  the  Sentries  and  maybe  even  the Sentinel
himself.

The amount of energy you have is  shown  at the top left of the screen
in the form of Robot,  Boulder  and  Tree icons. A coloured (non-blue)
Robot icon is worth 15 energy units.

MOVING : To move around  the  landscape,  you  must create a Robot and
then, with the sights still on,  press  the transfer key. You will now
be in the new Robot, facing your old Robot, which you can now absorb.

WARNING : The indicator on the  top  right  of  the screen is the scan
warning. If a Sentinel or  Sentry  spots  you,  this indicator will be
filled with specks and you will hear  a warning buzz. You have about 5
seconds to move out of view before your energy is drained 1 point at a
time. Once all of your  energy  has  been  drained, then you have been
absorbed and the game ends.

If the warning indicator is  only  half-filled with specks, this means
that the Sentinel or Sentry can see you but cannot see the square that
you are stading on, which means that  it cannot absorb your energy. In
this situation, it looks for  a  Tree  near  you  and  turns it into a
Meanie.

The Meanies' job is to flush you out,  which it does by forcing you to
Hyperspace. The Meanie rotates quickly,  making  a low clicking sound,
until it can see you. You will then Hyperspace to a new location.

HYPERSPACING : Hyperspacing effectively wastes  3  units of energy, so
try to avoid using it. It creates a new Robot in a random position and
automatically transfers you to it, leaving  your old Robot behind. You
will end up at the same  height  or  lower  but never on your original
square. If you Hyperspace will less  than  3  units of energy, you are
destroyed.

Once the Sentinel has been absorbed,  you can no longer absorb energy,
although you can still create  objects  and  transfer to other Robots.
When you Hyperspace while standing  on  the Sentinel's tower, you will
be given the 8-digit entry code for  a  new landscape. Which one it is
depends on the equation:  Landscape given = present landscape number +
energy left

COMMENTS : "Highly playable  and  addictive,  The  Sentinel  is one of
those rare games that makes owning a computer a delight."
RATING : 97% (CRASH #40, May 1987)

NOW : Still a brilliant  game,  THE  SENTINEL  did appear briefly in a
rather garish 16-bit  incarnation  on  the  ST  and  Amiga. An updated
version with  ULTIMA  UNDERWORLD-like  texture  mapping  would  be  an
awesome game!

CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston, Cursor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM : Sabreman, fresh from  his  adventures  in SABRE WULF, is trapped
within a haunted castle. It's your job to help him escape...

GAMEPLAY : Lots of running and  jumping,  basically. There are lots of
unpleasant creatures around as usual  but  they don't kill you, merely
knock you off your feet.  The  only  thing  that  can kill you in this
game is long falls. Unfortunately, there  are  a  lot of long drops in
UNDERWURLDE, so the creatures are  more  dangerous  than they might at
first appear.

You do however have some  defence  against  the  creatures - there are
several different types of  weapon  scattered  around  the maze. These
will kill most creatures. However,  there are three guardians covering
the three  exits  from  the  castle  which  can  only  be  killed with
specific weapons. If Sabreman  is  to  have  any  chance of escape, he
must find at least one of  these  weapons  and kill a guardian with it
so that he can pass.

There are many  very,  very  long  drops,  particularly  in  the lower
regions of the castle. Sabreman can  climb  down these by jumping onto
the rope that often swings from the  ceiling of these very long drops;
by pressing the down  key  he  can  lower  himself  down  to the floor
several screens below.  However,  one  collision  with  a  creature is
enough to knock  him  off  the  rope,  in  which  case  he will almost
certainly plummet to his death  far  below.  To  get  back up the very
long shafts, Sabreman can use  the  volcanic bubbles which emerge from
craters at the bottom of the  shafts  -  the bubbles are strong enough
to take his weight and carry  him  back up. Again, though, a collision
with a creature is enough to make  him  fall to his death or burst the
bubble.

As usual, there are various bonuses  to  be collected. The most useful
are, of course, extra lives but there  are other things - for example,
a temporary immunity to  long  drops  can  be  gained from magic gems.
With one of these, Sabreman can  fall  any distance without dying. The
only problem with these is that their effect can expire in mid-fall...

=======================================================================
CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston, Cursor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM :  The  country  has  been  invaded  by  waves  of  hostile  alien
spaceships. Instead of attacking military installations, however, they
are intent on polluting the  landscape  with  a lethal red virus which
kills off all  plant  and  animal  life.  Determined  to  counter this
threat, a pilot is strapping himself into the cockpit of his state-of-
the-art Hoverplane. This  is  equipped  with  the  latest technology -
long-range scanner, laser cannon and smart bombs, all of which will be
needed to destroy the aliens.

GAMEPLAY : The action is shown  in  3D with wire-frame vector graphics
showing the Hoverplane  and  the  enemy  ships.  The  contours  of the
landscape are shown by  a  pattern  of undulating squares representing
the earth's surface.

The long-range scanner in the top left  corner of the screen shows the
position of the enemy  ships  in  relation  to  the Hoverplane. Gauges
above the main playing area show the  amount of fuel remaining and the
plane's altitude. Extra fuel can be obtained by landing at home base.

 The Hoverplane is controlled by thrusting the engines and rotating
the craft. At high altitudes, the fuel supply is automatically cut and
the plane lowers rapidly towards the ground. You move, helicopter-
style, by dipping the plane's nose and thrusting. You can refuel by
landing on one of your landing pads.

During play, a map of the land can be displayed showing polluted areas
in red. All enemy ships in  the  attack  wave must be destroyed before
the whole map turns  red.  Each  wave  contains many different aliens,
including the following:

1. SEEDERS - flying saucers which hover and sometimes land, spraying
             the virus.
2. BOMBERS - high-flying alien ships which drop "packets" of virus.
3. FIGHTERS - fast-moving ships which try to shoot you down.
4. PESTS - small kamikaze alien drones which try to collide with you.

Collision with any alien  ship  results  in  the immediate destruction
ofthe Hoverplane. If an alien  attack  is  defeated,  you gain a bonus
score determined by how much  of the landscape remains uncontaminated.
An extra Hoverplane and smart bomb are awarded every 5,000 points.

Red,  Green and Blue colour bubbles and  then using Cat to collect the
droplets of colour as they fall to the ground. Droplets collected will
be stored in the cauldron displayed at the bottom of the screen, until
such time as you have enough of  each colour to make the target colour
displayed in the cauldron on the far bottom right of the screen.

In the three levels which have aliens  on:  one has red, one has green
and one has blue. It is therefore  necessary to move between the three
levels using the tunnels to collect  all  three colours. To complete a
level, you must colour in  the  whole  landscape. After each colour is
collected there is a bonus stage.  After  this, Wiz enters Wiz-Lab and
is given a Wiz-Perk by his  guardian  angel. You may select one weapon
or control, which  will  be  magically  endowed  up  on all subsequent
Wizballs from birth, or opt for  the  bonus of 1000 points x Wiz-Level
number.

ICONS : When certain aliens are killed they will deposit a green pearl
which will remain stationary  on  the  screen.  If Wizball passes over
this pearl and picks it up  the  first  icon  on the top of the screen
will glow; this indicates that Wiz has  the option to select a feature
representated on the  icon.  If  you  want  to  select another feature
collect more pearls until the icon  you want is glowing. Several icons
have two possible functions. The icons are, from left to right:

1) Thrust - Gives Wiz more control over the Wizball and allows
            him to move it left or right.
 Antigrav - Gives Wiz total control over the Wizball and stops
            the bouncing.

2) Beam - Gives Wiz supa-beam weapon.
   Double-Gives Wiz and cat automatic two-directional firepower.

3) Catellite    - Gives Wiz a cat fresh from training college.

4) Blazers      - Gives Wiz and Cat super rapid fire blazers.

5) Wiz Spray    - Gives Wiz mega spray protection.
   Cat Spray    - Does the same for Cat (but Wiz and Cat cannot have
                  spray at the same time).

6) Smart Bomb   - Kills every sprite in sight.

7) Shields      - Gives Wiz and Cat shields for a limited period only.
