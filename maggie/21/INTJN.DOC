
Interview with Jonathan Nott, the guy responsible for the Atari
Net Locator on the Internet (and one of the users of  42BBS!)


~ Can you give us a brief run-down of your life so far (where you were 
  born, which schools you attended, etc) ? ~

I was born in Southmead hospital (Southmead being one of the rougher 
parts of Bristol). I lived in Bristol for about 18 months before 
moving to the lovely town of Portishead, just outside of Bristol. I've 
lived in this same house for the 14 years since (yes people, that 
makes me only a skimpy 16). I've now completed my secondary education 
at Gordano School, Portishead (in the top 250 best UK schools) with 
pleasing GCSE results, and I'll be staying at Gordano to do A-levels.


~ Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems 
  have you owned? ~

Only a sad Toshiba MSX I'm afraid. But I did write some excellent 
stuff on that system :-)


~ How long have you been an Atari owner? ~

Ooh, tricky one. At a guess I'd say 5-6 years, but don't quote me on 
that. I purchased my first STfm from Richard 'FOG' Davey and then have 
moved on through another STfm, and STe and now a Falcon. I have never 
sold an Atari, so my STe is right next to the Falcon on my desk (I'm 
typing this on the 'e'!), the FM's are piled up on the floor next to 
my feet.


~ What do you think of the Atari scene in general?? ~

Certainly the friendliest bunch of people possible! It seems pretty 
logical though - the best machines get used by the best people. You 
never feel isolated (especially if you're into comms). You would on 
the PC as the scene is so massive that you could never really be 'in 
with it'.


~ Which demo, in your opinion, is the best you've seen on either the
  Falcon or ST?? ~

It's hard to pick out one.  On the Falcon, Cycedelic Knockout, Lost 
Blubb and EKO System get joint first. My best ST demo is certainly 
Froggies over the Fence, but other STe demos like Bedlam and Ambience 
also stand out.


~ What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc) ~

Well, there's me............
and, er,   Well Rich Davey (FOG, Mugwumps, Maggie, etc) lives only 5 
secs away, but as he doesn't actually own an Atari machine anymore, he 
doesn't count :-) There was another friend of Rich's called Steve. He 
was into Stos and Devpac. Dunno what happened to him. I think he 
moved.

Of course there's the usual guys from school who used to play games on 
their STs years ago but have now moved on to Saturns and the like. So 
basically there's no scene at all really. As for shops, I think the 
Silica shop in Bristol still sells Jaguars.


~ Which computer show(s) do you have fond memories of? ~

To tell the truth I haven't actually been to that many. There was the 
Bristol 1994 show, but I didn't really know anyone there. I went with 
Rich D, and basically followed him around as he bumped into FOG 
members. Doug Little was previewing Expose/Apex at that show, and I 
got a snap taken of me long before the stuff was even released. My 
claim to fame!

I can't remember going to any others except the Atari World shows at 
Christmas. It was much more cool that time as I met loads of people I 
know and managed to sells lots of copies of Skynet Times (RIP).


~ What did you enjoy most of all about the Maggie party ?? ~

It has to be actually meeting everyone that made it such a great time. 
Although I had already met CiH a couple of times before, I met you 
(Felice) for the first time, along with the Reservoir Gods, Tat and 
Mike Noyce (and all others that were there). I would have liked to 
have met James 'Power' Mathews, but he kinda got eaten up by the 
magnetism of a small Somerset town with the initial 'T'.


~ What is your opinion of diskzines on the Atari scene??
  (ie Maggie, ST Plus, etc) ~

The great diskzines we have are one of the best assets of the Atari 
community. I always take the time to read all diskzines that come my 
way. It is sad that some diskzines have recently left us. DBA was full 
of news from the European demo scene and had a nice shell. ST News is 
a major loss - Richard Karsmakers' writing is outstanding. He has a 
better grasp on the English language than any native Englishman I've 
met :^). I'm glad that Maggie is still with us.


~ What is your favourite TV show ?? ~

I guess it has to be the Chart show. I know it's not what you'd expect 
me to say, but I always want to catch up on what's happenin' with music, 
especially the Indie charts. I also like a good viewing of the X-Files 
or Star Trek. I never watch *that* much television.


~ And your worst TV programme ?? ~

Although the X-Files is an exception, I hate most tacky American 
dramas. ER, Chicago Hope etc. are typical examples of these.


~ What is your favourite movie of all time?? ~

The two new films 'Independance Day' and 'Twister' have first and 
second places at the moment, but I don't know in which order!

Some older films that I also still love are Back to the Future (all 
three) and the Terminator duo.


~ What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen?? ~

I've seen Top Gun so much that it makes me sick every time someone 
mentions it. I also detest the sight of ET and other such 80's 
misadventures.


~ Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies?? ~

Wil Smith was exceptional in Indepedence Day, so he's probably my fave 
for now. I also like him in the Fresh Prince on TV.
As for birds, probably joint between Meg Ryan and Terri Hatcher.


~ Who or what do you find everyone else seems to like, but which you
  personally loathe intensly ?? (this can include Mr Blobby!!) ~

I think I'll go for a famous person here, rather than offend any 
persons who might just be reading Maggie.
Many people admire Tom Cruise as a brilliant actor, but I find him 
boring and naff. The novelty has worn off. Somebody shoot him <g>.


~ You are a user of 42BBS, the home of the Falcon FacTT File.  What
  do you like about 42BBS that keeps you logging on so much ?? ~

I guess it has to be the users. People from other BBSs will probably 
disagree with me here, but anyone who's anyone in the Atari community 
is on 42BBS. It's the home of three user groups, my Web site, 
InterActive, CyberSTrider... the list goes on. Colin's great too - you 
couldn't have a friendlier and more helpful Sysop :)

I will certainly be on 42BBS until either me or 42 goes byeybye. I 
have now set up as a point off the system.


~ Some words, people and places to react to ...
  (please be as frank as you like) ~

        ~ Piracy

        I think the government should do more to combat wide scale 
        software piracy - it's theft after all. I'm undecided when it 
        comes to software where the companies are no longer selling 
        it. I guess no one is losing out in this situation.

        ~ Censorship

        With the recent events, such as Dunblane, the rape and 
        killing in France, Jamie Bulger.. (the list grows), I think 
        it is time for the world as a whole to take as serious look as 
        the way we deal with damaging material. We should consider 
        what kind of world we want our children and grandchildren to 
        live in.

        ~ Dunblane/Hungerford

        Ooops, I kind of answered this above. I don't think that the 
        guy should have be allowed to own firearms at all. I'm would 
        fully support a complete ban on guns. The government should 
        not allow firearms licences to be given to anyone with a 
        criminal record or mental condition.

        ~ The infamous British tabloid newspapers (Daily Mail, et al)

        I never often read the tabloids, but from what I've seen the 
        writers can't write to save their lives. Papers like the Sun 
        will do anything to raise their readership figures. That 
        sucks. If a paper is a good read, people will buy it.

        ~ Arnold Schwarzenegger

        Nice pecks.

        ~ Independence Day (the movie)

        One of the best movies I've seen for ages. Wil Smith is 
        brilliant in it. The storyline is so unbelievable that I love 
        it! One reviewer said "If you bring your brain to watch this 
        film, you're overdressed!". Pure obsurd magic!

        ~ Gillian Anderson (Dana Scully, X-Files)

        I think we'll go for the 'Nice pecks' answer again here.

~ If we were ever to visit you (ie, myself and CiH), where would you 
take us for a night out?? ~

There's a newly refurbished pub called 'The Albion' in Portishead. 
This is the hotspot for us young people. But as I'm under 18 it'll be 
your shout :+>


~ Who is your favourite musical group? ~

This is another very tricky one - I love many types of music by many 
artists. I know, here's some CD's I got recently....

Alanis Morrisette - Jagged Little Pill
Ash - 1977
Eden Burning - Brink (great Christian band)
Soul Survivor 95 Live (SS is a christian music festival)
Smashing Pumpkins - Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness
Jamiroquai - Virtual Insanity


~ Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet?? ~

Easy. The Spice Girls (with their recent no. 1). This type of track is 
the reason Americans are often cynical about our music.


~ Who is your favourite music singer ?? ~

Alanis Morrisette - she has an outstanding voice.


~ Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection? ~

Well, I've listed the new ones above. Some oldies I dig out often are:

Extreme - Three sides to every story
Therapy? - Troublegum
Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream
Shamen - Boss Drum
The Orb - The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld
Orbital - Snivilisation


And there we draw to a close.......
