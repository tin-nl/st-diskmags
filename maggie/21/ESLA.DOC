                       ESLA LEAGUE MANAGER III

o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o


Probably the first form of sport  simulation  to hit the home computer
came in the form of management  games. These bombarded the player with
screens  of   facts   and   figures,   labouring   sadly   under   the
misapprehension that statistics were the new rock'n'roll.

As the success of Fantasy Football shows,  we are a nation of armchair
bound football fans, obsessed with  ever  footballing fact and figure.
Pubs are  inhabited  by  the  human  form  of  the  database  who  can
effortlessly reel off results and teamsheets from decades ago. The sad
fact is that people  who  really  follow  football actually like these
type of games. And the even  sadder  fact  is  that  I am one of these
people!

So I've nailed my colours to  the  tree.  I  am  the Alan Green of the
Maggie team, and in his typical  blunt  style  I  am going to draw the
line here. If you aren't a big  fan of the sport involving an inflated
pigs bladder being kicked about then stop reading now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not often that I get a  chance, or have the inclination, to talk
about packaging, but  the  ELSA  packaging  deserves  a mention. After
16/32 found an unusual use for  video boxes (they became the packaging
for Llamazap), Merlin  have  decided  that  putting  floppy disk based
games in CD boxes is the way  forward. Good idea, those big boxes that
computer games used to come in were ridiculously out of proportion. It
also gave me a good chance to  try  out the "I've just bought a Square
CD" gag on Ripley. And she fell for it!

ESLA is an amiable game,  quite  happy  to  run on all atari platforms
from the ST to the Falcon. As  long  as  you  have 1mb of RAM and your
machine supports "ST LOW" then you  can indulge in some serious Sunday
management.

On loading the game you are presented with some neat 16 colour screens
informing you that the  game  is  an  official  "Eurpean Sunday League
Association Product". Who wants the  Premiership  license when we have
exclusive rights to fat old biffers  wheezing around pub car parks the
nation over? Alan Shearer? Bah!  We  have  Joe Slopstop, by day deputy
assistant meat arranger for  "Bollockchops  and Sons family butchers",
but every Sunday donning the skidmarked shorts and top of Frigglesworth
FC, west Cumbria's  finest  Sunday  league  team  (Ratchet's Bolts and
Doorknockers Division 3). Showbiz eh kids?

Often computer games try to gain all the kudos they can from glamorous
titles, the name  helps  to  elevate  the  game  in  the  eyes  of the
consumers. I can't  imagine  the  official  endorsement  of the Sunday
League association  encouraging  the  kids  to  dig  deep  into  their
pockets.

Still, on with the game as some football manager probably said.

You next get to choose your lanaguage as ESLA originates from the fine
footballing nation of Germany. I  believe  they  did  very well in the
World Cup of 1966, just being beaten  in  the final by one of the most
majestic teams world football has ever seen. And a Russian linesman.

Fortunately you can play the  game  in  English. I believe the English
team did remarkably well in the 1966... (snip! Ed)

After this you get the  obligatory  "footballing action" picture which
has to appear in ever football  game  BY  LAW.  You know the sort. One
player is running along with  the  ball  at  his  feet, and another is
attempting to inflict  crucial  ligament  damage  to  his ankles. This
proves it  is  a  REAL  football  game,  with  real  MACHO  action. Or
something.

The credits now appear with the author thanking his 520 for not dying.
In a twist on  this  sentiment,  can  I  criticise some notable public
figures for not dying. These include the current Conservative cabinet,
Mary Whitehouse, Atari's marketing  team,  The  cast of Neighbours and
the lead singer from the Spin  Doctors.  Oh,  hang on I have just been
informed that Atari's marketing team  actually  died  15 years ago but
nobody in the company noticed.

ESLA is a game packed with  obscure  options. The first option you are
given is the opportunity to choose the background colour on which text
appears. However, a lot of the colours  that you can choose are pretty
redundant as they are the same  as  some  of the text which makes this
text invisible. Wibble. My  advise  -  stick  with "atari" grey. (Hey,
that sounds like a  paint.  Do  you  think  Dulux  will be interested?
Perhaps there is  a  future  for  atari  -  in  the  form  of  a solid
emulsion!)

ESLA proves that it has taken  the  E into consideration by giving you
the choice of 32 different countries to  play in. Even Wales! All over
Cymru Falcon owners were celebrating the  fact that our country had at
last been recognised. Never before  have  all  the  Falcon owners of a
country taken to the streets! Then I went back inside.

We are now into the game  startup  screen.  Here you get to choose the
number of players (1-4) and the  starting  league for each player. You
can also define the  capacity  of  each  stadium  for each player. One
quite bizarre feature is the one allowing you to decide how much money
you want. Needless to say,  I  decided  my mid-table 3rd division club
would need 99 million pounds "to have a chance of the play-offs".

Some of the other options are not of the type you usually find in this
sort of game.  You  can  choose  what  situations  will  lead  to your
sacking. You can choose whether you  want  "No licens due to capazity"
(sic) and no I don't have a clue  what  this means. Nor do I know what
the slightly baffling "screen slides in and out" is on about.

You can also toggle the  tax  for  not  fielding enough players on and
off. This is pretty irrelevant as  the  fact  that you will be soundly
beaten should be enough of a disecntive to turn out less than 11 men.

We are now onto one  of  the  most  entertaining  parts  of the game -
choosing your team. The entertainment value  of  this part lies in the
ridiculous nature of the sunday team names. Here I will present a list
of some of the top teams from the Sunday leagues of England:

"YUPPIES FC LINFIELD"
"LUCKY FC MILLWALL"
"DUNDEE NOMADS"
"FAST FORWARD PLYMOUTH"
"COOL MINERS WREXHAM"
"OLYMPIA IPSWICH"
"MANCHESTER INDIANS"
"BALLYMENA CANNIBALS"
"INTER COVENTRY"
"MOUNTAIN BOYS SHEFFIELD"
"HUDDERSFIELD PRIESTS"
"SUNDERLAND THUNDER"

I don't  know  who  came  up  with  these  names  but  they  should be
congratulated for their vast  comedic  potential.  As  we  here at the
Maggie team are quite literally   humming  with  humour, we thought we
would give you some witty one  liners concerning these team names. Get
ready with the drumsticks CIH!

ZEBRA FC WIMBLEDON - I always said Vinny  Jones should be in a zoo but
this is ridiculous!

WEST HAM SHARKS - The hammers always  were out of their depth! I think
they will sink without a trace this season!

GO AHEAD LUTON FC - Quite possibly  a line from a film involving Clint
Eastwood and "Dirty" David Pleat.  "Go  Ahead  Luton  FC. Make my day.
With an ambitous 5-3-2 system  involving  wingbacks pushing forward at
every opportunity. Punk".

Boom, and indeed boom. The  other  names  conjure some quite ludicrous
images.  The   kilted   bag-pipe   playing   Mancunians   of   "OLDHAM
HIGHLANDERS". The  ID  software  sponsored  "PORTADOWN  DOOM  FC". The
Irvine Welsh led "ROUGH BOYS EDINBURGH".

As the team-name induced mirth  subsides,  you  sober up for a meeting
with your board. They inform you of  what they expect. They give you a
target league position and tell  you  what  bonuses  they will pay for
league and cup success.

Its time to pack your bags, wave  goodbye  to your loved ones and head
off to the training camp. This  is  one  of  the unique facets of this
game. The camp last  five  weeks  (fortunately  not real-time) and for
each week you have  a  row  of  five  tiles.  Behind  each tile lies a
message: "GOOD", "BAD" or  "SUPERB".  When  you  click  on  a tile the
message is revealed. If it is  "SUPERB"  then the fitness of your team
increases and you move onto the  next  week.  If  it is "BAD" then the
fitness of your team decreases and you  move onto the next week. If it
is "GOOD" you can choose again, or stay at that fitness level.

As you can see this is all pure chance, and for such an important part
of the game this is all  rather  too  flippant. There is absolutely no
skill in clicking on these tiles  and  games like this should be built
on skill, at least where the  manager  is concerned. If the fitness of
players is going  to  deviate  by  a  random  amount,  this  should be
automatically calculated by the computer, the player shouldn't have to
be hampered by clicking on tiles.

After each  weeks'  training  you  are  presented  with  the formation
screen. This is where  all  major  managerial  decisions  are made. It
displays a list of all your  players  (maximum squad size is 18). Down
the left are an array of  icons,  including all the different possible
formations. One  button  displays  all  the  players'  transfer value,
another shows their wages. From here  you  can also access the options
screen, the stadium  rebuilding  screen,  load  and  save, results and
statistics.

The statistics themselves are not very comprehensive. You can view the
league table (although this is  already  shown after every fixture has
been played). You can view the league at home table or the league away
table. These should really just be displayed as the league table.

The only list of player statistics  is  top scorers, and although this
sounds interesting it only displays  the  scorers from players' clubs,
not from any other clubs so you  can  never really guage just how well
your strikers are doing in comparison with their contemporaries.

The most bizarre statistic  has  to  be  the  table  of referees. This
doesn't detail the number of  red  and  yellow  cards they have dished
out, but how much  money  they  have  and  how  many  houses they own.
Wibble!

Each player has 3 key  statistics:  skill, power (fitness) and morale.
These are added together to form  a  total,  and players are ranked by
this total. Power and Morale are  volatile values that deviate quite a
bit from week to week whilst skill stays relatively stable.

You can't actually pick which players  are  going to be in your squad.
The computer automatically picks  the  highest  ranked players in each
position. All you can pick is  the  actual formation. This gives you a
frustratingly "hands-off"  approach.  One  of  the  major  parts  of a
football management game is picking  your  team.  To take this away is
like playing a beat-em-up without the  ability to punch - the computer
would simply pick the best punch for you.

Buying and selling  players  is  very  awkward.  There  is no transfer
market, and you can't search for a particular player with a particular
skill in a particular position. At  the  bottom left of the screen are
four boxes,  one  for  each  position  (Goalie,  Defender, Midfielder,
Attacker). If a player of that  position is available (there will only
be one per week) then a number  will appear in that box indicating the
total value of his skills, otherwise the box with have a cross through
it.

If you wish to  buy  that  player  you  click  on  the box. The player
statistics then appear and you can choose to bid for him or cancel. If
you bid for him  you  always  seem  to  get  him  even when up against
computer opposition. If you are bidding  against other humans, then it
will go to a random player.

A major handicap  in  this  game  is  the  difficulty  in transferring
players. You can't actually get rid of players as there is no transfer
market. If you want to offload one  of  your players you have to renew
his contract, and at this point other interested clubs will make a bid
for his services. If the player  is  bobbins then the chances of other
clubs bidding for him are virtually  nil  so you are lumbered with all
the rubbish players. As the maximum squad  size is 18 you can't buy in
many players without getting rid of  a  lot of the older players. This
is a major flaw in the game.

Before the game begins, you get  to  predict  the outcome of the game.
You can boldly  announce  that  you  are  certain  to  win, or timidly
whimper that you think you will be slaughtered. This forecast seems to
have little effect on the result of the game, although the manaul says
that your clubs image depends on it.

Most linesmen and referees are open to bribery before the game (unless
you are  playing  another  human).  This  certainly  doesn't guarantee
victory. When a referee's palm  has  been  crossed with enough silver,
you will be informed that he has "bought a house in kent". And you are
then shown a picture of the  referees'  house. Why all referees choose
to live in Kent is baffling, but obviously a lot of research went into
the geographical preferences of this nation's officals.

After you have done a "George Graham"  with the ref, you can start the
game proper. The game is  displayed  as  a  line with dips and troughs
represented the attacks of the  teams.  When  you  score  a goal a big
dialogue box appears which displays  the  player's  name, his head and
the number of goals he  has  scored  this  season. When your opponents
score you get no such dialogue  box  and  as the game moves so quickly
you can blink and literally miss 3 goals from the opposition.

This actual "game" section can  be  a  tension  packed affair if it is
doen right. It has to be  quite  slow  and display all the oppositions
chances and goals as well as your own. ESLA fails in this respect.

Another feature that should be  mentioned  is the built in Minesweeper
clone "Balls". This is quite slow compared to, say, "Lamemines" but is
still a lot of fun. A  slight  criticism  of  this  is that it is very
hard, there are far too many balls.

So there we have it.  ESLA  League  Manager  III. Graphically it looks
nice with some cool backgrounds featuring various atari machines, club
badges and flags from various  countries.  The overall presentation is
of a good standard, but it is badly designed.

There are not enough relevant  statistics  to appease the game-playing
stattos, and the "game" section  isn't  exciting enough to capture the
attention of the more arcade oriented  player. There isn't enough turn
around in the transfer market  to  keep  the  game lively. The players
themself  don't  have   enough   statistics   to  really  characterise
themselves. The other clubs aren't  fully  modelled so the environment
doesn't feel very realistic. And you can't even pick your team.

Since  the  mighty  "Championship  Manager"  has  hit  the  ST,  other
management games have stuggled  in  its  wake. If Championship Manager
was "Ajax" then ESLA League Manager would  be a team languaging in the
Diadora league, that is the gulf in quality and appeal. There are even
games on the PD that perhaps don't  look as good as ESLA but certainly
play better.

Sunday bloody Sunday league manager.
