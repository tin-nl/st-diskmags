
 
    Interview with Roy Goring, who is a member of the Wessex Atari 
                Group (and one of the users of  42BBS!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Can  you give us a brief run-down of your life so far (where  you  were  
born, which schools you attended, etc) ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I  am 42 and have lived in the Portsmouth area all my life.  I went  to  
school  in Hilsea at a set of schools that were all on the  same  site. 
After  leaving  school  with 6 CSEs and 2 GCEs I went  on  to  Highbury  
Technical  College.  I stayed there for four years and ended up with an  
extra 7 GCEs and 2 A levels.

Whilst  working on a building site as a summer job,  my mate  suggested 
the  Fire Brigade.  I looked into it and within a month I was in and at  
training school.  I've been there ever since,  22 years. I have 8 years  
to go before I retire at 50.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Prior to you owning an Atari computer, which previous systems  
have you owned?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have always owned Ataris. 

I  started  with a 800 with a tape deck,  moved on through more  8-bits  
like  the 800XL and the  130XE with disk drive.  In 1988 I bought a STE 
1.62.  Last month I bought a second hand Falcon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
How long have you been an Atari owner?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 1983.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You have just recently purchased a Falcon.  Why is this ??
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I  enjoy  surfing  and I was considering getting a  PC  to  upgrade  my  
system as I was finding the STE limited.  But I decided to get a Falcon  
instead. Just need 14Mb now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What do you think of the Atari scene in general??
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well I've stuck with it since 1983, so what do you think?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which  demo,  in  your opinion,  is the best you've seen on either  the 
Falcon or ST??
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I very rarely look at demos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shops  - none.  Wessex Atari Group is improving all the time.  The only  
other  local Atari stuff is 42BBS which I enjoy,  and I like to pop  up  
and visit Colin now and then.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which computer show(s) do you have fond memories of?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have only ever been to one computer show,  this was way back when the 
ST  was first launched.  It was in a hotel in Hammersmith.  It was very 
busy. It was hot. And I bought a load of cheap 5 1/4" disks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your opinion of diskzines on the Atari scene??  (ie Maggie,  ST 
Plus, etc)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  have  to  admit  that I have never read  any  diskzines  other  than 
AtariPhile,   which I like. But I'm biased on that 'cos I value Colin & 
Kevs opinions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your favourite TV show ??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  like sit-coms.  The list is too long to mention.  But I suppose if I 
have  to pick one, it would have to be 'The Thin Blue Line'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
And your worst TV programme ??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anything with guns, violence etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your favourite movie of all time??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  don't  have one.  Again I watch comedies,  and I like the  Airplane, 
Naked  Gun, Hot Shots genre.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  couldn't tell you.  If I don't like a movie I switch it off.  I very  
rarely go to the cinema.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies??
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't  have  one.  I watch a movie because of the story not because  of  
who is in it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who or what do you find everyone else seems to like, but which you 
personally loathe intensly ?? (this can include Mr Blobby!!)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anything with guns, violence etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You  are a user of 42BBS,  the home of the Falcon FacTT File.   What do 
you like about 42BBS that keeps you logging on so much ??
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The  fun that is had in messages,  and the support from others when you  
have Atari problems.

Some words, people and places to react to ... 
(please be as frank as you like)

Piracy
Up  until  recently nearly all my Atari software was  pirated.  I  have 
stopped that now.

Censorship
It happens, Most of the time I don't care because it doesn't effect me.

Dunblane
Awful.

Colin Fisher-McAllum (no, this is not a mistype!!)
"I love that man" :-p 
He does a great job looking after 42BBS, and is always very helpful when  
users need assistance.

The infamous British tabloid newspapers (Daily Mail, et al)
Don't read them :-)

Independence Day (the movie)
Haven't seen it, and I am unlikely to.

Pamela Anderson
Who?

If we were ever to visit you (ie, myself and Chris Holland), where  
would you take us for a night out??
Most probably to my Fire Station where we have a very nice bar :-)
 
Who is your favourite musical group?
This one is easy - Pink Floyd :-)
 
Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet??
I am flexible about all types of music. Someone out there like what I  
think is awful.
 
Who is your favourite music singer ??
Don't have one but I like single female singers like Joan  Armatrading,  
Tracy Chapmam etc.

Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection?
All of them, including the classical ones.
