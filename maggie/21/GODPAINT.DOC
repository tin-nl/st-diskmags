******************************************************************************* 
******************************************************************************* 
Let's begin..

*Firstly: 
--------- 
In general,  LEFT mouse button SELECTS,  RIGHT  mouse button QUITS (from screen 
to  menu,  from window to menu etc.) Undo can be achieved by pressing the  Undo 
key (wow). God Paint file format = .GOD

Loading God Paint 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
God  Paint  can  be  run off floppy or Hard Disk.  To  load,  double  click  on 
GODPAINT.PRG   and   after  the God Paint intro screen has loaded,  click  left 
mouse button,   (author's address will be displayed) left again (you are now on 
the draw screen) and right to access the menu.

The Menu 
~~~~~~~~
On  the  menu screen is  a  magnification  window,  the current pen  head,  RGB 
colour  bars and a series of icons   which   allow  you to carry out  different 
operations,  such as drawing filled boxes,  cutting blocks etc.      To exit to 
the screen, move  the   mouse  pointer onto free space (white) and click right, 
or press space.

The Magnification Window: 
------------------------- 
This  is the  smaller  of   the   two   Magnification   windows  in God  Paint.  
It will magnify that part of the screen  the  mouse  pointer was over when  you 
last exited to the menu with the  right   mouse   button.    Beneath the window 
are  four  arrows,  clicking left on each of these  will  allow  you to  scroll 
around your magnified picture, clicking right on them  will  move  in  steps, a 
quick  way  of moving around the image.   To the right of   the   window    are  
three  icons,  the  '-' (minus) icon decreases  the  magnification,   the   '+'  
(plus)   icon   increases  the magnification and the blue  square  alters   the  
magnification    to   exactly  16x16 pixels,  which can be  useful  when  doing 
sprites of  that  size,   since  one sprite will fit exactly into the window.

The Pen Head: 
------------- 
Below the  magnification  window  is   a   grid,    this   displays the current 
pen head (the default pen head is one  pixel   in  size).   You can change this 
by  drawing,  with left mouse  button  on  the   grid,    to   delete   you use 
right button.   The 'P' icon next to the grid accesses the pen studio, but more 
of that later.

The Colour Bars: 
---------------- 
On  the three RGB colour bars the level of  colour ranges from 0 at the  bottom 
to  full (31 R/B,  63 G) at the  top.     You  can alter the level of colour by 
clicking on the desired place on  the  bar   with   the   left mouse button but 
there  are  also some nifty keyboard short-cuts which come in  handy.   If  you 
press '*',  '-', '+', on the numeric keypad it will  select  the   three colour 
icons at the right of the colour bars,  ('*'  selects  Red  bar,  '-'   selects   
Green   bar,  '+' selects Blue bar (you can also click on these  manually  with  
the left mouse button)). Once you have done this, press '0'  (on  the   numeric  
keypad)  and  each colour bar you have selected will increase  by   one   step,   
similarly,    pressing  '.' will decrease them (you can also click on  the   up  
and   down  arrows  next to the colour icons).      Other useful short-cuts  on 
the numeric keypad:

         Pressing 1 will decrease Red down to zero 
         Pressing 2 will decrease Green down to zero 
         Pressing 3 will decrease Blue down to zero 
         (Thus pressing 1, 2 and 3 will give you black)
         Pressing 4 will increase Red up to full colour 
         Pressing 5 will increase Green up to full colour 
         Pressing 6 will increase Blue up to full colour 
         (Thus pressing 4, 5 and 6 will give you white)
         Pressing 7 will decrease Red by one 
         Pressing 8 will decrease Green by one 
         Pressing 9 will decrease Blue by one
         Pressing ( will increase Red by one 
         Pressing ) will increase Green by one 
         Pressing / will increase Blue by one

The Icons: 
---------- 
The rest of the menu is taken  up  with a series of icons,  these cater for all 
the other functions, such as  drawing   lines,   boxes,  polygons, circles etc.  
If  you move over an icon,   text  will  appear  at  the  bottom  of the screen 
telling you what that icon does.  Clicking left on  an  icon will either select 
it  e.g.  filled  box,  co-ordinates,   or   it   will   activate    it    e.g.   
greyscale,    swap colours.   On some icons you can click right button to bring  
up  a  preferences window for that icon e.g.  filled circle,  pen   mode.     In   
these   windows  you  will  be able to alter certain things,  to select  a  new  
setting  e.g.  on the filled circle menu, changing from  solid  to  shade,  you  
use    the    left    mouse   button.    When  you   are  increasing/decreasing 
numerical values,  the   left  mouse  button will change the number in steps of 
one,  clicking   and  holding  left and then clicking and right will change the 
number much more  quickly.   To exit these windows you click right button.

Blocks 
~~~~~~
Cutting and Pasting: 
-------------------- 
The block mode (Scissors   icon)   allows   you   to   cut  and  paste parts of 
your picture.  First select the  icon   with   left  button,  then  exit to the 
screen.  Click (and release) left to make the  first  point of your block, move 
the  mouse until the block is  the  desired  shape   then   click  left  again, 
the block will now be on your mouse pointer.  To  place  it,  just  position it 
where  you want it and click left.   To flip the block  before  you   place it, 
use  the cursor keys.   Right mouse button will remove the block from the mouse 
pointer.

Block Types: 
------------ 
If  you  click  right  button on  the   Scissors  icon   it  will  bring  up  a 
preference window.   The different block types  you  can  have are Solid, X-Ray 
or  Back.   Solid  means that  when   you   cut   the   block    ever    colour   
will    be  present,  even  the background colour.    X-Ray  means   that   the   
first   colour  in your palette (default of black) will not be included in  the  
block  and Back means that the block will be displayed behind every  colour  on  
the   screen,  except the first colour in the palette (again default black).

Move Types: 
----------- 
On the preference window,  you   will   be   able  to  change  the Move Type of 
your  block.   It  will be defaulted to Move,  which  means that the block will 
move  over  the screen as normal,   but  there  are   various   other  options.  
Add  means that the block will be added to   whatever   you   paste    it   to,  
its colours will increase (unless it is put down on black),    Sub  means  that 
the  block will be subtracted from whatever you paste it to.   There  are  also  
options  such  as  And,  Eor,  Nor,  Nand etc.  but apart from creating  amusing  
messes  of your picture, I find these to be of little use.     If you wanted to 
brighten  or  darken   part  of your picture by a controllable amount then  you 
would create  a   filled   box   of  colour:  R\01 G\02 B\01 then cut this as a 
block with Move Type on  Add  or Sub (to lighten or darken). You would position 
this  block  in the   desired   place   and  paste  it  as many  times  as  you 
wanted,  until  the  correct   hue    was   obtained.     When    you  do  this 
operation, the Block Type should be selected to either Solid or X-Ray.

Block Size: 
----------- 
If the Block Size is on Define   then   this  means  that you make the size  of 
the block you wish to cut, as you  are  cutting  it, if the size is on Box then 
you can alter the X and Y  values  in   the   preference  window to create  the 
exact size of the block you want to cut e.g.   16x16,   32x32,  11x45 etc.  and 
when  you exit to the screen a box of that size will be on your mouse  pointer.     
If  you have cut a  block  but   realized  that  you  wanted it on  X-Ray,  not 
Solid,  then  you  can exit to  the  menu  with  the space bar and  change  the 
block to X-Ray as normal.  You  can  then   exit   back   to  the  screen (with 
space  or right button) and the block will still  be  on  the   mouse  pointer, 
but will now be in X- Ray mode.     Blocks will load   into   the   top   left-
hand   corner  of  the screen unless otherwise instructed.

The Grid 
~~~~~~~~
The default Grid size is 16x16,  but  this  can be changed by clicking right on 
the grid icon and then altering the X and Y values.     For extra accuracy when 
cutting   sprites  (for  example,  of size 32x32) you would use grid and  Block  
Size   Box   together,    increase the grid to 32x32 and then select the  Block 
Size as a Box of 32x32.

The Palette
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To view the current palette   click   left   and  right  mouse buttons together 
(or  Return  on the keyboard)  when  you   are   on   the   draw  screen.   The 
palette options are as follows:  Choose,  Pick,  Swap,  Copy,   Range, Mix.  To 
quit the palette, use right button.

Choose: 
------- 
Choose  allows  you to select one  of  the  colours  in  the palette,  it  will 
then  become  your pen/line/box etc.,  colour.     You   also  use  Choose  for 
some of the other operations you do in the palette, such as Range, Copy etc.

Pick: 
----- 
Pick allows you to pick  a  colour  from   the  screen (with left) and  include 
it  in the palette.   It will  replace   the   currently  chosen  square   (the 
one with the white border around).

Swap: 
----- 
Swap  allows  you to interchange   the   positions   of  two   colours  in  the 
palette. First use Choose to select one of  the  colours you want to swap, then 
select Swap and click on the colour you want to swap it with.

Copy: 
----- 
Copy  allows  you to copy   the   same   colour  onto  other   squares  in  the 
palette. Click on Choose to select the square you wish to copy then select Copy 
and click on the square you want to copy it to.

Range: 
------ 
Range  allows  you  to  generate a  range   of  different  shades  between  two 
different  colours.   Use  Choose to select  the  first   colour  you  want  to 
range between, then select Range and click on the second colour.

Mix: 
---- 
Mix  allows  you to combine different  colours  in the palette to  make  a  new 
colour.  Use Choose to select the base colour,   then  select  Mix and click on 
the colour you want to mix with the base colour.

Loading/Saving 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To load or save work the icon   you   will  need  has  a  picture of a disk  on 
it.  Clicking  right  button  on  this  icon   will   bring   up  a  preference 
window  for file formats,  so if you wanted to  load  an   Egg  Paint  picture, 
you  would click on the file format displayed after  'Load  File   Type'    and  
then  select  Egg Paint from the list brought up (left button),  right   button  
will  then exit you from this menu.  To complete the operation  you  will  need  
to   load  in the Egg Paint picture,  so you would click left on the same  disk   
icon  and  select 'Load Picture'.  It is also possible to load and save blocks, 
to save  a block select Save Block - God Paint will send you to the screen, you  
then   make  a  box around the block you want to save,  or use a predefined box  
size,   and   once   you have done this it will exit to the Gem  File  Selector 
where  you   type   in  the  name of your file e.g.  BLOCK___.GOD.      If  you 
select Load File Type:    Auto  on  the file format window, this means that all 
graphics files will be  displayed   in  the file selector and you will be  able 
to  load  any  of them,  as  long  as  God Paint caters for that  file  format.     
To  load a block into the  mouse   pointer  instead of the screen,  click right 
on  the disk icon to  bring  up   the   file   formats  window.   At the bottom 
of this window is an option:  Block Dest., select  Mouse  and then load a block 
as normal. It will now load into the mouse pointer.

The Magnification Studio 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on  the  Magnifying  Glass  icon  will    allow   you  to  enter  the 
Magnification Studio.   In the studio, there is  one  window  for the magnified 
image  and one for the unmagnified image.    As  you  draw  on   the  magnified 
image,  the  normal image is real-time updated so that you can  see  what  your 
amendments  look  like  on the real image.      The arrows at the  top  of  the  
magnify   window  allow you to scroll around the image.   There are two    sets   
of    '+'    and   '-',    the  first  '+' increases the X  magnification,  the  
second   '+'   increases   the   Y  magnification. The minuses decrease X and Y 
magnification.    Clicking  on  the  segmentation icon will put a white boarder 
around  all the   pixels   in   the  magnify  window,   so that you can  easily 
see each individual one.  The  black   icon  allows  you to set the size of the 
magnification   window    e.g.     16x16,     32x32    etc.      To   exit  the 
magnification studio click right button.

The Pen Studio 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on the 'P' icon next to the current Pen Head on the menu  will  allow 
you  to  enter the Pen Studio.    The   box   in   the  centre  of  the  studio 
displays the current pen head which you draw  on  with  left button and  delete 
with right.   The arrows at the top of the  screen   allow   you  to scroll the 
pen  head  around.    You  can  also  flip  the    pen    head    horizontally,   
vertically   or   in 90 degree steps.  Inverting the pen means that what    was  
black   (and thus pen) becomes white (and thus not pen) and vice versa.    Fill  
pen  gives  you  a nice,   chunky pen head, clear pen gives you no pen head  at  
all   (so  you literally would not be able to draw anything!).   You can toggle 
the   segmentation of the pen head box off and on and you can magnify the   pen  
head   (with   the  plus icon) incase you have got your contact lenses in  back  
to   front.    The   minus  icon decreases the magnification. The two arrows at 
the  left  of  the  screen  allow  you to view the six different  default  pens 
available,  the  icon  beneath   them   allows  you to load and save pen  sets.  
To exit the pen studio, click right button.

The Greyscale Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you click  (left  button)  on   the   Greyscale   icon,  your entire picture 
will be transformed into shades of grey.    But  beware!  there  is no Undo for 
this.

The Swap Colours Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking right mouse button on this  icon  will  bring up a preference  window, 
in this you  select which colour you  want  to  swap  with which e.g.  Red with 
Blue  (click  on red square at left and blue  square at right).   Right  button 
exits the window and then left on the icon will carry out the swap.

The Mask Screen Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mask  Screen allows you to change   the   colour  balance  of the whole  screen 
e.g.  increase the red content, decrease the blue etc.     If you add 10 Red to 
the   screen  and  then decide you don't like it and want to change it back  to 
how it was,  you  then  have to subtract the same amount of Red from the screen 
(-10).   Once   you   have  done  this  it  will be back to its original colour 
intensity,  but if  you  were   to   click  left on the icon a second time,  it 
would decrease the red content of the screen by ten.

The Resize Screen Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  left  on this icon will  send  you   to  the screen,  where you  will 
have to decide on the amount you want  to  resize  your picture,  by decreasing 
the  size of a box,  the bottom  right-hand  corner  of   which  is attached to 
your  mouse  pointer.  When  the block is  the  desired  size,    click    left  
button  and  your picture will be altered accordingly.   You can do  this    as   
many  times as you want, but clicking right will finalize the size (there is no 
undoing this either).

The Colour Box Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Colour  Box allows  you  to  create   a  filled  box,   shading  between  three 
main  colours.   The  default Colour  Box  will   produce   a  box that  shades 
between  blue,  cyan  and red,  but you can  change  the   colours  by clicking 
right  on the icon and changing the sets of RGB values.   Here are some example 
Colour Boxes:
               RED GREEN BLUE 
         Start -00+ -48+ -00+     This will give a Colour Box shading 
between: 
         X End -19+ -00+ -31+     Green, Purple and Red/Pink 
         Y End -31+ -00+ -11+
               RED GREEN BLUE 
         Start -00+ -00+ -14+     This will give a Colour Box shading 
between: 
         X End -00+ -35+ -31+     Blue, Light Blue and Yellow 
         Y End -31+ -63+ -00+
               RED GREEN BLUE 
         Start -31+ -50+ -00+     This will give a Colour Box shading 
between: 
         X End -20+ -20+ -20+     Orange, Pink and Green 
         Y End -00+ -40+ -10+
               RED GREEN BLUE 
         Start -20+ -00+ -31+     This will give a Colour Box shading 
between: 
         X End -13+ -13+ -31+     Purple, Blue and Green 
         Y End -05+ -63+ -15+

The Filled Circle Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  right on this icon  will  bring  up   a preference window,  on  which 
you can choose between a Solid (one colour)  or a Shade (many colours)  circle. 
The  Solid  circle  will use your current colour bar  colour,   but  the  shade 
circle  has to be created by altering the   values   in   the   window.    Here  
are some example shade circles:

         RED -31+ -00+     This will  give  a  red circle, shading to 
green at the 
       GREEN -00+ -63+     centre. 
        BLUE -00+ -00+
         RED -00+ -00+     This will  give  a blue circle, shading to 
black 
       GREEN -00+ -00+     around the circumference. 
        BLUE -00+ -31+
         RED -00+ -31+     This will  give  a blue circle, shading to 
white at 
       GREEN -00+ -63+     the centre. 
        BLUE -23+ -31+

The Smooth Icon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Smooth  allows  you to quickly  blend several colours together,  removing  hard 
edges  and anti-aliasing lines.   On the preference window you can alter the  X 
and  Y co- ordinates of the box size,  e.g.  you  could  have a box the size of 
the screen,  the box will become your mouse pointer  and  everything  inside it 
will be smoothed.  You can also change the  Smooth  Step,  the   lower the step 
e.g.  R/0,  G/0,  B/0,  the more it will shade.      If you have the  Red  step  
relatively  high,   about 15, and the Green and Blue steps at 0 then the object 
you  shade (provided it has at least some of all three colours in it)  will  be 
shaded  to   red,    as   the green and blue are stripped away quicker than the 
red because of the lower smooth step.

*******************************************************************************

     There are many more  icons  in  God  Paint,    such  as Spray Can,  Letter 
Box (for those a  little  bemused  by  this  icon,   it  allows  you  to create 
square/rectangular  boarders - on the screen  make  one  large  square,  then a 
smaller  one  inside and it will fill in  the  space    between    them    with   
either  one  colour (solid) or many colours (shade)),  Cycle,  Slow  Draw,   K-
Lines,    Rays,   Fractals  etc.,  but  I am not going to explain how all these 
other icons work because:

1)   This is not the God Paint manual
2)   Hopefully, by now you  should  have  grasped the structure of the 
     menu system and be able to cope with it on your own
3)   I have explained the more  useful functions, for serious drawing, 
     those left tend towards being gimmicky.
