From a slightly uncrowded postbag, this surprise entry in from Bonus of 
the organisation formerly known as the Diskbusters.. 

                      ----------v----------

(This  letter was sent also a month ago but I think something has  gone 
wrong somewhere.....)  

Hello Chris,   I think you didn't hear from any of the DBA lately or am 
I  mistaken ???  Well at least I (Bonus) didn't.  After phoning several 
times and e-mailing also Sietse "Slimer" Postma didn't reply to any  of 
these  messages.  He  already told OTM at the party in Hamburg that  he 
didn't  want  to proceed much longer with the magazine and  after  that 
contact has been rare.  After consulting with the DBA party here (thats 
the  complete(!) programming department) we came to the sad  conclusion 
that it had no use to proceed.

It's  really  shit how things went these last three months,  I mean  he 
could  have at least told us normally after the release of magazine  15 
that  there would be no more to come.  I just made the shell as perfect 
as  I could and we had good comments on it so that shouldn't have  been 
the problem. The whole idea behind all these we here believe is that he 
alone wanted to proceed with the magazine on the internet by using  the 
M.I.  pages  so  he wouldn't have to depend on us anymore.  So it seems 
that after all these years of competition you won after all.  Even with 
our  very  good shell,  even when I say so myself,  we (the programming 
department)  won't continue this magazine or a complete new  team  will 
have to do so using it.

So  what  now,  another  group down the sewer ???  Well not  completely 
because I saw this coming for quite a while.  We are already working on 
a  new  group with new members,  members of Synergy and of  course  the 
remaining  part of the DBA.  This looks very good indeed until so  far. 
The new group name will be: "FUN". Another magazine group, well no, not 
if  I can help it.  We may use the shell again sometime but a magazine, 
no  way.  We  are planning to finish the unfinished parts of  the  DBA, 
which were mainly my programms.

Most  of  these things were never finished because of the fact  that  I 
worked alone on them and I have a normal full time job (yes some people 
seem  to have in the DBA) which leaves very little time.  But I already 
spoke  with  the new members and they will help finish it  as  soon  as 
possible.  So  what  projects can you expect:  The PD/shareware CD  for 
Falcon  only,  Men  at  War (maybe even on the CD),  Slippery Sam  (new 
version, the old DBA version has 2 very nasty bugs I found last week.), 
96ktro  DBA  source of the Symposium '96 release,  Super Module  Compil 
(over  200  modules  on  1 disk),Sokjeban (a game  by  The  Match  (new 
member)),  Snatch (also by Match),  a new version of the Mega Depacker, 
an  unofficial magazine 15 ( yes I will finish it with what I have  got 
over here !) and some smaller things like demos to introduce ourselves.

Expect  all these things to happen before the end of '96.  Three of the 
above  things are already finished and waiting to be released,  we will 
make  a  HTML page were you can download them so loads of  people  will 
have to come by ;-)

Maybe  I will write for the Maggie some new stuff if you like,  or even 
make something to release by you and the rest of the Maggie crew. Right 
now  I have to help some people moving from one town to another,  after 
that we can start with the real stuff....

Hope to hear from you again in the near future, 
 
Alexander " Bonus " de Vries
P.s. please don't mind the typing mistakes and don't say Hi to Slimer 
from me !!!! Oo. 

P.s.  2  I just had to tell someone how it all went wrong and since you 
run the (now) number 1 diskmagazine I thought you were the one. correct 
me if I was wrong...... ..  .

                      ----------v----------

A  drop of hope here,  we'll be looking out for the final DBA mag issue 
real  soon(ish)  -  make it a good 'un!!  Hope you like  this  slightly 
rushed  Atari Show special issue of Maggie,  and any contributions will 
be most definitely welcomed in the future..

PS. Don't worry about the typing errors, they're history.. (Hopefully)
