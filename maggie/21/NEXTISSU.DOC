Maggie 22,  due out around the end of the year, erm probably, more like 
early '97, how does February sound??

In here next time, well you can't predict absolutely everything that is 
going  to go in here,  but with a fair degree of certainty,  we suggest 
the following..

Nemesis  Falcon Accelerator review,  it's cheap and it's also dead good 
(at least on paper,  but we've yet to see the thing in action, but it's 
by  Titan  designs,  so it must be ok!) Also,  more on Apex 3 and  Apex 
Audio perhaps as well?

Autumn  Atari  Show report,  the usual big write up in the grand  style 
you've  become accustomed to every time one of us sets  foot  outdoors, 
many of you will also be aware that we are to participate in this one a 
lot  more than normal,  as we have our own stand space there!!  (A real 
time  article is not on the cards at this very moment,  but don't  rule 
one out..)

Various  game reviews,  lots of them,  many having being held back from 
this  issue of Maggie,  as Mr Pink and Ripley went a little bit mad  on 
the  textfile  front,  heading the list is a review of  Moongames,  the 
follow up to Moonspeeder,  which has been re-released as freeware since 
Compo went bust,  good on them!  Also the new, new Tony Greenwood game, 
which now has a name,  'Heartlands',  that is,  if it doesn't make this 
issue, which there is currently a fair chance of it doing..

Demos, almost certainly.. 

More diskmags, more multi-media, and not a drop of heavy metal in sight 
unless Noycey contributes in that department..

New writers!  Well Rich Karsmakers is not so new,  but will be somewhat 
unemployed as a result of ST News closing down,  and he said he'd write 
for  us..  Also  some 'inspirational' texts from that king  of  textual 
madness,  Jodie Smith,  who said he'd like to do some stuff for us, and 
we'd like you very much to do that for us my son..

What  else?  Maybe  some  reports on the new Atari  paper  mag,  'Atari 
Computing',  which I don't think we can quite report objectively on, as 
we have an input in it with our own guest pages.. Ho well..

More  Reservoir Gods poetry???  I'm inspired to rehash some of my Louis 
Macneice offerings (see issue 13) to inflict on an unwilling world..

What else???

(Have  a heart,  we can't do much of a script for the next issue if  we 
haven't got this one fully out of the way yet!!)

Just be there!!
