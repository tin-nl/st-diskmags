                              UTILITY: It  may  have  the  oddest name 
                               since "Easy  Rider",  but  what  does it 
                               actually do for your Falcon?
                              HOUSE OF (S)PAIN: Tat


ScreensPain? Or is it ScreenSpain? S-Creenspain? Scree'n'Spa-in?

Who knows, but this natty piece of  kit is not a geography Edutainment 
 title, rather more a neat utility  for  serious Falcon owners who want 
 to get the  most  out  of  their  video  chip,  or  even the ambitious 
 dabbler. Anyone who has had a Falcon  for  more than a week knows that 
 there are hundreds of applications (even  NeoN-3D, costing a couple of 
 hundred quid!) which have terrible problems coping with setting up and 
 restoring video modes. ScreensPain  is  a  valiant (although sometimes 
 flawed) attempt to remedy this. It has been knocking around in several 
 forms for a while now,  and  a  newer,  non-Shareware version has been 
 bundled with the ScreenBlaster hardware in Germany. 

The authors of this Shareware title (registration is 30DM - see later) 
 were responsible for  the  original  German  video  documentation from 
 Maggie 20: demo programmers  from  Aura  and  the  Mugwumps... and the 
 first thing that strikes you when  loading ScreensPain is that it's in 
 German. Not a good start, but readers  can rest assured that once they 
 have the hang of it, it's the  easiest way of designing your own video 
 resolutions currently available - in fact, probably the only way.

                                IN USE

The program  interface  is  GEM-compatible  (don't  try  with MultiTOS 
 though, the  screen  switching  can  cause  problems)  but  requires a 
 640*400 minimum  screen  resolution,  and  after  the  initial warning 
 dialog  boxes,  you  are  presented  with  a  bewildering  display  of 
 switches, sliders and numerical inputs. It looks very confusing, but a 
 quick click on the "Testen"  (Test)  button  gives  you  a test of the 
 currently chosen resolution, where, by  using  the mouse and the right 
 button, you can define the screen  positioning, border size and so on, 
 but here you can see exactly what the finished product will look like. 
 Pressing Enter (to accept change)  or  Esc  (to reject) returns you to 
 the main panel again.

The options available are exhaustive:  even the screens' frequency can 
 be altered, the border positions  tweaked  to the nanosecond(!) and of 
 course screen  size,  pixel  cycle  size,  (for  fat/thin/normal width 
 pixels) bitplanes and  double  line  or  interlace  (or  both!) can be 
 defined.  Even  ST-compatible  modes,  or  GEM-compatible  modes,  can 
 forced.

                       BUT HOLD ON A SECOND...

...and herein lies the main  problem  with ScreensPain. Because of the 
 incredible number of options that you  can  tweak, it is impossible to 
 automatically define  resolutions  that  are  simultaneosly compatible 
 with RGB/TV (the two use  identical  settings),  VGA  and SM124 all at 
 once: they all use different  screen  frequencies, pixel cycle lengths 
 and border positions to create similar mode.

This problem is inherent within the video system of the Falcon itself, 
 and explains why Atari  were  so  anxious  for  everyone who wanted to 
 alter video settings to use  the  operating  system calls - which were 
 awful,  so  everyone   ignored   them.   My   version  of  ScreensPain 
 automatically detects the monitor  type  and  initially  sets up video 
 settings accordingly. What is really needed is a button to convert one 
 RGB resolution to a VGA one, and so on... but this is easier said than 
 done. You  really  need  both  VGA  and  RGB  monitors  to  create two 
 resolutions, each to be  used  in  certain  cases. Unfortunately, many 
 people don't have both.



But back to the program....  Once  defined  to your taste, resolutions 
 can be saved, along with 40 characters of text to define its use, as a 
 .SCP  (ScreensPain   file),   or   as   68000   assembler   sourcecode 
 (automatically optimised for you!), or  a  GFA-Basic .LST file (easily 
 converted  for  STOS-Basic  users.)  So  inclusion  in  your  programs 
 couldn't be simpler. Happy coding.

But that's not  all.  Registered  users  can  use ScreensPain-produced 
 resolutions with an AUTO-folder  program,  similar to FalconScreen, to 
 fool the Desktop into  giving  different  resolutions. Want a 1600*800 
 Desktop in 16 colours? Just say the word. Overscan? Tiny joke screens? 
 CinemaScope Dolby Surround-Sound Trashcan?  (well,  I  lied about that 
 bit.) Almost anything that ScreensPain produces can be used.

And finally, some tips for creating wacky screen modes:
           - The "Pixeltakt" button (it means pixel cycle length, that 
            is how many video  processor  cycles  each pixel is display 
            for, or its width) can give  extra-fat pixels with VGA with 
            a setting of 4, or extra-thin ones on RGB with a setting of                 
            1.

           - Similarly, RGB's default clock-speed setting of 32Mhz can 
            be altered to 25Mhz to give  30% fatter pixels - that's the                 
            trick that many demo  coders  use  to  get more complicated                 
            effects  on   screen   without   sacrificing   frame   rate                 
            ("Terrorise Your Soul" is  a  good  example: nearly all its                 
            effects use this mode)

           - VGA  monitors  normally  run  at  60Hz  -  but  not  with                 
            ScreensPain! Depending on the bitplanes  and screen size of                 
            your  resolution,  framerates  can   be   tweaked  to  give                 
            different values. This is  how  some  demos  managed to run                 
            "identically" on RGB and  *nearly*  all  VGA monitors (e.g.                 
            Abstract's X-Perience demo)  WARNING:  some  monitors can't                 
            handle this, but have fun trying!

WARNING: The author cannot be  held  responsible  for you turning your                 
            monitor to toast with these tips. Heh Heh.

                              CONCLUSION

Overall, a very useful package which  behaves in exemplary fashion and 
 not inconsiderable style. Now, if only they'd let me translate it into 
 English...
