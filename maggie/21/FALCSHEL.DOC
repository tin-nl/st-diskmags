                            (C) 1995 RESERVOIR GODS

Hello  and  welcome all to  the  Falcon  Maggie  shell (which  has already  been
cruelly dubbed "Faggie"). This is the  first  version  of the shell so there are
bound to be plenty of bugs in it,  so  stop  that moaning at the back! The shell
does run happily on both  RGB  and  VGA  monitors  via  a system of custom VIDEL
routines which I hope work on all monitors! I have tested it on my Atari monitor
and Ripley's SVGA and it seems to work  ok. This shell requires 4mb of memory to
run.

In the beginning there was "Maggie 1" and  Maggie 1 was bad - probably the worst
text displayer ever seen,  4  colour  title  screen,  gem  menu bars etc. Maggie
steadily got better with a  new  shell  for  issue  4 (slightly buggy) which was
improved so by issue 8.1  it  was  one  of  the  best  gem based shells any disk
magazine had seen. Then Delta Force stepped in.

The Delta Force Maggie  shell  is  now  quite  legendary  with its big scrolling
boxes, fast text displayer, nice fades. My only (minor) criticism of it was that
I felt the design, like the content of  their magazines, was a tiny bit clinical
and lifeless. It still remains the best ST disk magazine shell every created.

Late in 1994,  CIH approached  me with  some  ideas about a new maggie shell for
the Falcon. I said this would be an excellent idea, and I would start work on it
soon. I was pretty busy with other Reservoir Gods productions at the time and it
wasn't  until  February  of  1995 that  I  knocked up the first routines - a 256
colour text displayer with pictures behind the text and lovely graduated rasters
flowing behind it with some  DSP  music.  Unfortunately  rasters tend to flicker
horribly on the Falcon, especially when using  other interrupts so this idea was
shelved.

At the start of the  summer  I  started  recoding  the whole shell from scratch.
Ripley and I spent a lot of  time  designing each different section of the shell
(what do you mean you can't tell!) and we hope this is now a magazine that fully
represents the Falcon's capabilities.

 THE MAGGIE MENU
 ---------------

We had various ideas for this  -  one  with  the  text boxes appearing as little
parchments that unfurled as you clicked  on  them, and then simulated a "blowing
in the wind effect", pieces of boxes  wizzing together from various sides of the
screen and various other obscure  ideas  (most  of  which  were Ripleys) until I
finally had the idea to rotate and scale  in  the boxes. A germ of this idea had
formed when I saw the  intro  screen  to  Lost Blubb. Unfortunately everyone who
sees this remarks on its similarity to an  effect  in Apex Media (which is a lot
better than mine!) but I hadn't seen  this  effect until after I had coded mine,
and I was pretty annoyed as I  thought  I  had come up with something (slightly)
original.

The menu icons were designed and  drawn  by  Ripley.  There are a lot more icons
available than the ones you see on the first  issue. The main menu is coded in a
modular way and different icons and  menus  can  easily be added by changing one
line. Menus to look out for in  future issues include: programming, internet and
the uncalled for return of eddiecat (what does it mean?)

The main menu runs in 320*240 true colour  mode  so has ample room for an "issue
defining cover picture" (CIH tech-speak)  which  was  elegantly  drawn by SH3 of
Reservoir Gods, who will be a bit down cast tomorrow as David Pleats rejuvenated
Sheffield Wednesday side hammer Liverpool.

Along the bottom of the menu is a scroller - well Richard Karsmakers has them so
why can't we! Hopefully it  will  contains  kilobytes  of enlightening text, but
quite probably it will be full of  utter  mindless crap in the true tradition of
scrolltexts. Did you know I have drunk half  a  cup of tea during the writing of
this article? Hey this scrolltexts lark isn't so difficult...

 THE LOADING SCREEN
 ------------------

Rejoice! As you disk drive/hard drive furiously  retrieves bits of data, you can
admire the glorious true colour artwork of  SH3 whilst a little white bar creeps
along the screen.

The fadeout idea was  blatantly  copied  from  one  of  Tat's  bit in the recent
Avena/Digital Chaos Fried Bits 3 demo which  I  think  is one of the best Falcon
demos ever released, even if  other  people  who  work for the magazine disagree
with me.

 THE TEXT DISPLAYER
 ------------------

It displays text! It scrolls  about!  Erm,  thats  about  it!  Yes, its the text
displayer. Nicely making use of the Falcon's  256 colour mode with overscan with
some rather turgid one plane text. I must apologise about the low quality of the
fonts, they were just some I found lying  around (on Maggie 16 actually) and the
graphics people don't seem too enthusiastic about  drawing an 8x8 one plane font
- and who can blame them?

You do get the  added  "bonus"  of  a  starfield  in  the  background (which can
thankfully be turned off) and the  usual  slider  and  arrow bars. Page and line
numbers are displayed for you to drool over.

On the top menu bar are  three  options.  On  the  far left is an arrow pointing
left, this is the exit arrow. In the middle of the screen there is a button with
an "i" on it,  this  brings  up  the  information  and  options  screen. On some
selected articles you will see the "SEE PIC"  icon. This will glow to inform you
there is a picture accompanying the article. Click on it to view the picture.

Keyboard control:

Up arrow - move up line
Down arrow - move down line
Left arrow - move up page
Right arrow - move down page
Insert - move to top of document
Clr/Home - move to bottom of document
F1-F10 - select font
Undo - Return to main menu

You can also scroll the text by clicking on the arrow icons or slider bar.


 PICTURES
 --------

As Maggie is now on a high density disk, there is plenty of room for pictures to
be included. From  now  on,  the  majority  of  games  and  demos reviews (where
possible) will have a picture with  them.  How  do  you get these amazing screen
shots you ask in bewilderment. A-ha!  (no,  I  haven't enlisted help from an old
scandanavian pop group). That is down to  the "Reservoir Ripper" my new graphics
ripping utility. With this I have been  able to take screenshots from just about
every single Falcon game and demo. Maybe one day  I will release it, but it is a
bit fiddly to set up unless you have some knowledge of interrupts and the like.

So look out for the glowing  SEE  PIC  icon!  I  have written some custom screen
setting routines so I  can  quickly  skip  into  a  multitude  of resolutions. I
haven't had the time to  thoroughly  test  them  on  all  monitors, so if you do
experience problems get in touch with us!

 INFORMATION
 -----------

Information is power! And now you have  the power to change information! (Clever
wording, cheers). On this  screen  you  can  generally  mess  about  and have "a
laugh". Or something. Its like a nightclub with its trancey pulsing lights. Well
its not really. Right, on this screen  you  can  GOTO a line (wahey), change the
colours of the text displayer, turn the  starfield  on or off, find a string and
even save the current text file.

You can change the font  (pick  from  any  one  of  ten quite repulsive alphabet
sets!) and mess around with the music.  Those  of you with VGA monitors may want
to turn the internal speaker on (if you  dare!) and there is a volume slider bar
to control the output level of the music.

There is also some quite  useless  information  about  the  text displayed - the
number of lines, words,  pages  and  even  the  average  word  length for you to
calculate who is the most verbose of the Maggie writers!

Oh, and there is some  sort  of  plasma  effect  behind this screen. Pretty poor
really but I was rushed for time.  Yes,  that  is  the best excuse I can come up
with!

 THE HIDDEN QUEST
 ----------------

Started by Sammy Joe in the early maggies  where your main incentive to get past
the questions was seeing a  hidden  article  featuring  crap heavy metal lyrics.
Huzzah. As, unfortunately, the Maggie team  are  no longer spotty long haired 15
year olds (we are all starting to go grey),  we toyed with the idea of hiding of
hiding some lyrics of some more mature  music, like Dire Straits or Celine Dion.
Strangely, most people we talked to in a random street survey wouldn't answer 40
questions about the Falcon demo scene  just  to  read  the lyrics of Brothers in
arms. So instead you get whatever we drag up  from the internet,  usually  dodgy
in nature, but are you surprised, eh? - Thought not.

 THE BUGS
 --------

Let me introduce you to the bugs, you  will  be  meeting quite a few of these on
your journey through the maggie shell.  You  will  become so familiar with these
you will begin  to  treat  like  friends,  if  not  family.  The  bugs are there
specifically to annoy you (but mainly me) and  to try and make everyones life as
uncomfortable as possible. But hey, life goes  on, so lets just pretend they are
not there for now. Try  ignoring  them,  or  squinting  through one eye when one
comes into view.  Alternatively  shout  at  it.  Bugs  don't  like  loud voices,
especially early in the morning. You could  always  wait for the next version of
the shell, where I am going to do a bit of ethnic cleansing on the bugs.

Here comes the long winded back  patting  ego  massaging part, so if you weren't
involved in making Maggie, you better skip it. Its sad, but it cheers us up.
