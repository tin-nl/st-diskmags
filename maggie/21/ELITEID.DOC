
Hey I was looking through my old letters  and  I came across this  which
I sent to David Braben in 1991/2 with ideas  for  Frontier Elite 2. Well
I thought it was interesting.


ELITE IDEAS
***********

1. In the original Elite many ships  speed was linked to their size in
the way that the smaller they  are  the  faster they move. That may be
true for terrastial craft but  in  space  surely  the larger craft are
more likely to be faster due to greater capacity for thrusters etc.

2. Tractor beams would be useful so that you could shoot a craft until
the escape pod is released then  tow  it  to  a space station to sell.
This could also be  used  as  the  basis  of  some missions. You could
perform a sort of galactic baliff role  if someone hasn't paid off the
bank loan on a craft etc.

3. For use with the above  a  'Escape capsule jettison device' used to
jettison other crafts escape  pod.  Obviously  this  would  be hard to
obtain perhaps loaned to you if you perform a baliff role.

4.   The   occasional   joke   craft    would   be   nice   like   the
librator,enterprise, tie fighter obviously very, very rarely.

5. No ID computer it spoils the game  when you know whats coming or at
least make it optional, expensive  and  the  first  thing to lose in a
skirmish.

6. Make the constrictor  from  Elite  into  a  popular  craft it looks
really good plus it shows a bit of progress.

7. Make some ships dockable  to  save  visiting space stations all the
time.

8. How about ship to ship communication so that you can threaten or be
threaten to other craft perhaps even  escape capsules so that they can
beg for mercy or you can.

9. Collision craft which can collide  with other craft to destroy them
you must shoot before they reach you.

10. How about electrical storms  so  occasionally  you  have to fly by
instruments alone.

11. Sun ships so reflective that  they  can fly close to stars because
they can dissapate heat so effectively.

12. Now that flying within the atmosphere of planets is possible don't
make all craft land based some should  be based beneath the oceans for
aquavebian creatures. The Moray Star  Boat  is  capable of this so you
could have combat sequences  with  low  visability  and slow movements
beneath the sea.

13. 'Structure Scanner' used to  scan  other  craft for weak points in
their shields and hull etc.

14. 'Radiation Zones' around  certain  gaseous  planets meaning a time
limit in that sector  unless  you  have  a  craft with extra radiation
shielding.

15. Unidentified craft warning indicates direction of unknown craft so
that you can avoid or investigate.  Once investigated it will not come
up as unidentified later.

16. Factory equipement, used  to  change  slaves  to food, minerals to
luxurys, alloys to firearms etc.

17. Automatic rear and side weapons available as expensive option.

18. Weapon X. Temporary reflection of all incoming shoots so that they
are returned to sender.

19. Probes. Small craft  destroyed  with  one  shot. Best destroyed as
they scan your computers emissions  and  can send delicate information
back to space stations.

20. Variable light so that the further from a star the darker it gets.

21. The occasional planetary collisions.

22. Jury Service.  Occasional  employment  at  space  stations to view
recording of captured pirates crimes and  then  you judge if guilty or
not. If guilty hes released from the space station.

23. If you successfully destroy the  leader  of a pack of pirate ships
they might request you become their new leader then you make decisions
for the whole group.

24. Network option two players in the same galaxy though they could be
at opposite ends or twogether.

25. Comets.

26. SOS signals from other ships under attack.

27. Races. Race  to  the  other  side  of  the  universe  for fame and
fortune. Winner gets new revolutionary ship.

28. Deadly virus means  whole  system  must  be  destroyed even though
still habited. This mission would supply  you with suitable devices to
destroy the main star and  its  planets and planetary satellites. Also
all craft that leave planets must be destroyed.

29. Vector only option for humble atari,amiga and XT pc's.

30. Don't just release  one  version  keep  improving it and releasing
updates so a  final  fully  playable  and  debugged  version comes out
later.

31. Do a versions for the following computers as well as ST and Amiga;
PC's, Falcon, Megadrive and Archimedes.

32. Have a galactic  clock  which  can  be  read  at space stations or
optionally fitted to  your  craft.  This  could  be  used  so  that at
Christmas other craft wish you a  happy  christmas etc. Plus it can be
used to introduce new models at normal yearly intervals.

33. When hyperspacing make stars  shift  into there red,green and blue
components and accelerate time outside the craft.

34. Make different versions for the  same  computer i.e. half meg, one
meg, two meg versions.

35. Release a  non-playable  demo  into  the  pd  circuit. To generate
awareness.

36.  Provide  very  easy  to   understand   manuals  and  possibly  an
instructive video as an option. Many people  don't like to spend a lot
of time reading manuals before playing so have a built in trainer mode
perhaps as a seperate program.
37. Make it possible to install to hard drive.

38. Use only manual/novella protection methods.

39. Time warp. One mission could be to destroy yourself. Due to a time
distortion event two cobras  appear  after  hyperspace. Under galactic
law only one can survive. So  this  mission  is  to destroy a clone of
yourself in an identical ship. Energy  depletion etc will be identical
so only using your skill of shooting and maneovering can you win.

40. Send me copies of the ST and Amiga versions.
