Many Moons ago a game appeared in the STfm "Summer Pack"  (circa 1987)
called  "Arkanoid".  This  game  took  "Break  Out"  into  a whole new
dimension with power ups, and the kind of game play long since passed.
In fact it was so  successful  it  even  spawned  a sequel "Revenge of
Doh", but by this time  the  genre  had  been  done  to death on every
conceivable platform.

 For those of you  who  missed  the  original  here  is the plot taken
straight from the "Summer Pack" manual

"....After the mothership "Arkanoid"  was destroyed, spacecraft "Vaus"
scrambled  away only to be trapped in the void. You control the "Vaus"
and have to  penetrate  32  levels  and  then confront  the "Dimension
Charger" whom you must destroy in  order to reverse time and resurrect
the ARKANOID......" (Yeah, right? Well it's different.)

 The thing that made  "Arkanoid"  stand  out  from  the crowd was  its
power ups. It was the first "Break Out" clone to use power ups and set
the standard for the genre with  everything from multi-ball to lasers,
so sticking two central digits up  at the "Lets just re-invent PONG(tm)
brigade" school of thought.

  "Arkanoid" also demolished the wall idea  with patterns of bricks as
opposed to the plain wall.  The  classic  Space  Invader screen can be
found somewhere in most clones today.

 In case you havn't gathered Kakanoid  is an "Arkanoid" clone, in fact
it's not just a clone,  but  a  blatant  copy.  It  has the exact same
graphics, screen  layout,  same  levels,  in  fact  the  only  visible
differences are (a) It allows you to  start on any of the first twelve
levels, there only appears to be 15  levels (I've just got to level 16
so there is more), there is  no  sound  (which could be a good thing),
there  is  no  2UP,   and  most  noticeable  its in  French. It is all
pretty old hat really,  however  this  game  does  have one remarkable
quality in that it is an almost  perfect "Arkanoid" clone in just over
54K which is great if you remember the size of the original (In total
500K+ <Phew>).

 The game itself is  passable  enough,  if  not  as  responsive as the
original,  and it is great  to  play  for the nostalgia freaks amongst
us. If you don't like "Arkanoid" stay  away,  if  you  do, have a ball
<grin>.
