                      by Kev "Taff" Davies

When I informed  CiH  that  I  intended  to  write  this  kind of
article, I had no idea on how I  was  going to do it or how I was
going to modify my beloved  Falcy on a limited budget.  However I
have decided on a rather novel approach, a semi-real time article
(a  new  and  exciting   way   to   provide   you  with  literate
entertainment), or in other words, bits of this article are going
to be transcripts from an audio tape I will be recording as I go.

 As most of us  Falcon  owners  have  STs hidden  away, (huddling
together in corners, fighting off  the  ravages of time and dust,
fighting amongst themselves with their electronic zimmer  frames) 
we can use  parts of  them  to  add  a  little  personal touch to 
our Falcons.

 Let's be honest the Atari casing is, in a word,CRAP and needs an
aesthetic kick up the backside,   so that  is where we will start,
with appearances so on with the tutorial type thingy.

Falcon Modification PART 1 (the keyboard)

Okay the keyboard is dull,  positively keyboring in fact. However
STs and Falcons have different coloured  keys (Aha! I think maybe
you are now following my drift :-> ).  So what we are going to do
is change our keyboard  into  a  multi  coloured  work  of art, a
positive manipulation  of  negative  space.  In  short  just less
boring. To do this we must first  open up the Falcon (opening the
Falcon invalidates the warranty if it is a C-LAB machine).

[a] Opening the ST and Falcon

"In front of me I have an ST and a Falcon, both on their backs. I
will start by removing the screws  on  the  back of the ST. There
are 3 screws along the  front  (below  the keyboard) and 4 screws
across the top remove them  with  a  Philips screw driver, do not
remove the  screws  directly  under  the  floppy  drive  as  they
actually hold the drive  in  place.  Turn  the  ST  back over and
remove the upper of the casing."

Repeat process with Falcon

[b] Removing the keyboard
"The keyboard is connected by  a  polarised line connector to the
motherboard, remove this carefully (use pliers if necessary)."

NB.  The  construction  of  both  ST  and  Falcon  keyboards  are
identical.

[c] Opening the Keyboard
"On the reverse side  of  the  keyboard  there are a lot of small
Philips screws remove these  (make sure you put 'em safe) using a
precision screwdriver. Be sure to  remove  the screws holding the
joystick and mouse port stirrup in place. Remove the circuit from
the keyboard frame,  be  sure  not   to  lose  any  of the rubber
contact cups (Note that although  the  keyboard allows for 2 cups
for the [ Return ] key only  1  is provided and fits to the lower
fitting."

NB. To remove some of the  screws  you  may have to break through
some plastic covering.

[d] Removing the key-tops from the frame

NB. AT THIS POINT IT IS VITAL  THAT  YOU KNOW THE POSITION OF THE
KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD!!!

"Get a small flat headed  precision  screwdriver, place it in the
indentation  below  the circular part of the underside of the key
and gently lever out the key."

Repeat of both keyboards and all keys you wish to swap.

"This is a long  job  so  don't  expect  to  get  it done in five
minutes."..... It took me 1h 15mins including reassembly.

[e] Replacing the keys
 Replacing the keys is just a matter  of putting them back in and
pushing the key-top onto the other part.

Reassembly is just steps [a] -> [c] in reverse..
