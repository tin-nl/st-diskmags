This  was the first prize winner at the Gigafun Convention,  and  quite 
rightly  so..  Stylistically owing a lot to the EKO 'System demo',  but 
with a few new effects of its own as well..

A mellow honky tonk jazz piano type modfile kicks off the  proceedings, 
no problematic screen modes changes,  thank you very much,  but a field 
of  deepest blue and the first effec is following up hard  behind  it.. 
This  is a huge 3-D coloured vector segment globe made up of  many  (ST 
pallete  style) colours which briefly fills up the whole  screen..  The 
ball  pulls away again,  leaving a plain but nicely designed and  drawn 
logo which sort of announces the presence of the demo..

The  next bit is a pun on a Mario Kart/Comanche landscape screen as  we 
race  around a texture mapped dirt track with the names of each of  the 
greeted  groups standing up on the track like so many fancy hurdles  to 
be jumped over..  Nervously quick,  but convincing nevertheless.. (When 
game based on this system due eh?)

Moving  on  to that oh so tricky mid-section of the demo with  a  fruit 
bowl  z-buffer effect,  a banana and an apple merge into each other  to 
avoid being eaten,  they are nicely shaded.. Some more conventional 3-D 
polygons also try a spell of z-buffering,  up to five or six at a time, 
and  extremely  quickly  as if to show that Exa have  really  got  this 
effect taped..

A  brief  pause for the only still artwork in the demo,  with a  superb 
piccy  by Flan of a woman being chatted up by a dolphin  (or  whatever) 
until  a fancy rippling picture clearer effect hustles  us  impatiently 
onto the climax of this demo..

This  is  a new variation on 'spinny 3-D objects'  with  a  brilliantly 
rendered shiny wood effect cross spinning in full view.. This has a lot 
in common with the ICE 3-D system seen in their NAS intro, but this one 
is  more  polished..  For the second and final effect,  we move on to a 
common  PC demo style 3-D object,  the shiny environment mapped  wooden 
sea-urchin!  As  3-D  objects  go,  this is very complex,  and possibly 
starting  to  put the DSP code under a tiny bit of  strain,  but  still 
plenty fast really..

That's it!!

Ratings..

Graphix:-  89%  - High general standard of  presentation,  super  still 
piccy by Flan..

Sonix:- 83% - Unobtrusive and mellow modfile..

Gee-Whiz:-  90%  - Some very nice and swiftly executed 3-D  stuff,  the 
wooden stuff at the end a must see..

Overall:-  89%  - A very good 96K intro,  could have done with more  of 
these at the Symposium..
