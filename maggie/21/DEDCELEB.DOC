Well  they  didn't make it to the 'turn of the century',  as  they  had 
previously  promised,  indeed,  didn't even manage to get to the end of 
1996,  which falls just a tiny bit short of the new millenium that they 
were going to see in.. 

'Format was due for the knackers yard for some time,  as there had been 
no  subscription forms in the mag for some time before..  I  personally 
believe that the rundown of the mag and eventually closure was  quietly 
prepared  by the Future Publishing management over a longer  period  of 
time  than we were led to believe..  The official version being due  to 
poorly advised sales figures which took the management by surprise  and 
persuaded  them to drop the magazine prematurely against the wishes  of 
the (remaining) editorial staff..

Where did it go wrong?  Well the magazine,  for all its faults and good 
points,   was  a  remarkably  objective  mirror  of  the  strength,  or 
otherwise,  of the mainstream commercial ST marketplace in the UK..  At 
its peak,  'Format managed to pull in over 60,000 readers, and got most 
of the way up to 200 pages.. The November 1991 issue (no 16) filled 178 
pages, with a combination of news, reviews, advertisments, and pictures 
of AN Cool stripped to the waist.. By the time of the final issue (86), 
the magazine has withered to just fifty pages, and the readership (ABC) 
figures box is tantalisingly blank, although Anders thankfully held off 
on the full frontal nude pose..

In between those times, a lot of things must have happened..

Firstly,  there  was  Atari's own contribution to the mess,  with their 
long drawn out commercial suicide starting with the failure to  support 
the  Falcon,  and  their  even  more blatant balls  up  of  the  Jaguar 
hardware,  probably  the  finest console ever to make it to 'also  ran' 
status..  The  Tramiel  family  are available for  party  bookings  and 
ruination  of  rival  businesses for a smallish  fee,  apparently..  ST 
Format were dependent to a large extent on what came out of the  mouths 
of  the respective Atari PR departments,  and suffered accordingly when 
something  (yet  again)  did not go to plan..

(The  Atari press department had a playful streak as well..  We visited 
the 5th 16 Bit Show in early 1992,  when speculation about a new 32-bit 
computer  (which  eventually became the Falcon) was  at  fever  pitch.. 
Atari representatives on their stand refused to say anything,  but took 
great interest in Maggie issue 8, the first outing with the Delta Force 
shell,  which  I  had brought to the show..  That issue had an  article 
about  the  'STEE',  the new wonder machine coming soon from Atari..  A 
subsequent  issue of ST Format reports on a computer with  suspiciously 
similar specifications, including PCMIA 'Smart card' storage, which has 
never  appeared  on  any Atari computers before or since!  I'm  not  as 
presumptuous  to believe that Atari cribbed our STEE story  to  mislead 
the mainstream press, but one might wonder??)

A  failure  of the main manufacturer and source of  new  hardware,  and 
ultimately,  new  readers,  meant  a gradual dropping off of commercial 
interest,  starting  with  the  big software producers,  and  gradually 
knocking  all but the most faithful and committed out of the field..  A 
large  percentage  of  the  page number drop was due  to  the  loss  of 
advertising for various reasons which we will go into now..

Apart  from the 'natural' wastage caused by the slow decline  of  Atari 
Corp,  a lot of damage was done by the STF,  or more accurately, Future 
Publishing policy of hiking advertising rates,  especially notable with 
the  takeover  of ST Review,  which had already generated a lot of  bad 
feeling with the Atari owning public..  It seemed,  rightly or wrongly, 
that  Future  were  abusing the monopoly status of STF  for  their  own 
benefit..  (To  which,  some  might reply,  "But Future Publishing are a 
successful  business and have to make profits.." - To which  we  reply, 
"Yes maybe, but there is such a thing as taking the piss!!")

The  proportion of advertisers willing to take up space,  or more  than 
the bare minimum,  declined as the price rose,  and the page count fell 
further..  You  may ask if they contributed to the decline of the Atari 
market  with  their high priced advertising,  but there was  the  rival 
publication Atari World,  which enthusiastically filled the gap,  until 
its  demise  in  early '96..  STF was a mirror of  a  general  decline, 
nothing more..

From  a  commercial viewpoint then,  STF was on to a loser without  any 
internal help from their parent company.. What of other factors?

STF lost a lot of respect with various parts of the Atari community  in 
the  last few years..  A lot of the bad memories come from the  Trenton 
Webb  era,  but  the  rot had set in before whilst Paula  Richards  was 
learning on the job..  It was her editorship that produced the infamous 
3% review of 'Mobsters City', the rather amazing Falcons with 1.44mb of 
RAM, and the over emotional 'piracy equals rape' article that was three 
years too late in any case.. 

By  the  time  Trenton took over,  he most famously added  the  notable 
Systems  Solution  'Huge  Metal Box' debacle to  the  record,  and  was 
clocking up great parody mileage in some mid-teen issues of Maggie.. An 
increasing  desperation of much of the content was apparent  with  some 
frankly  amazing PD reviews that followed in the inexplicable mould  of 
the Mobsters City review,  and we all breathed a sigh of relief when he 
departed  at about the time of the takeover of ST review,  where Future 
Publishing,  and  ST  Format  with  them,  plunged  to  new  depths  of 
unpopularity..  They even got a whole front cover for Maggie issue 16!! 
Much  of the fun in reading STF at that time came from gaffe  spotting, 
rather than reading the articles like you were supposed to! 

(As  a  point  of interest,  STF started to get a bit silly  when  Andy 
Hutchinson  took over,  the decline in editorial quality can roughly be 
traced back to when photo portraits of the editor started to appear  in 
the magazine??)

Subsequent editors, Karen Levell and Nick Peers had a lot to do, to try 
and  turn the mag around,  by that time,  they were also having to cope 
with  a falling number of pages,  and the knowledge that the  magazines 
days  were  numbered..  To both the latter editors credit,  the quality 
started  to pick up,  the articles were relevant to the latter days  of 
the  Atari  computer,  and it was really a pity that it finally  ceased 
publishing, although not that much of a surprise to many people..
   
With  Frank Charlton and others involved in the new  'Atari  Computing' 
mag,  hopefully  things  will  live on for a while yet..  However,  the 
passing  of ST Format from the shelves of WH Smiths and  others  really 
does  mean the end of Atari in whatever shape or form as  a  mainstream 
computer..
 
 'Rest in Peace ST Format, you were a great topic of conversation!'
