(Ahem,  I  think I've found a little bug in the text displayer that doesn't work 
with  one or two of the extended characters on the ascii set..  This has utterly 
killed the huge ascii-art logo that was formerly at the top of this text..  Huge 
ascii-art logo fans wishing to admire this textfile in it's original form should 
get the ST version which still has it running ok - Ed) 


     After the OVERWHELMING response to last issue's Poetry Corner, (the postbag
was literally FULL [of air]) we  have  had  to  enlist the Maggie team's help to
fill up the 'corner'.


     This issue's poems have been inspired by  a truly moving subject.  I'm sure
you have all heard  of  the  sad  departure  of  Atari UK's Software Development
Head.. Mr. Alastair Bodin.  It was this  devastating blow to the VERY heart, the
very LIFEBLOOD of Atari Corp. that inspired the Maggie team to don flowing black
robes, reach for the jumbo boxes of  Kleenex and scribble lines of pure anguish,
so potent that even the paper started weeping blood (or was it ink).

     Here follows our collected tribute to the hard work, dedication, excellence
and pure genius that wasn't Alastair Bodin..

          ..may he achieve his life-long ambition to become a PC Dad.



                             We love you ALASTAIR!

          Oh Alastair.. if only.
          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
          If you had been a fruit..
          You would have been a banana.
          If you had been a car..
          You would have been a write-off.
          If you had been a game..
          You would have been 'Break Out by Thomas Haines'.
          If you had been a computer..
          You would have been unavailable ("We don't sell that here").
          But since you were human
          You were an arse.

     When Alastair Bodin does his weekly shopping he takes a portable scientific
analysis kit with him so that he can test  the food to ascertain if it really is
food.



          Bodin's Birth.
          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
          The day you were born
          Angels sang,
          Trumpets rang
          And entire Atari scene felt VERY forlorn.



          Ode To Alastair.
          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
          Alastair Bodin
          Alastair BoBin

'Please note, desk will now be in use'.


Ensuing article in National paper:

     The chair belonging to the ex-head of Atari Corp's UK offices, Mr. Alastair
Bodin, collapsed today in shock after  being  sat  on  for the first time in ten
years.  When asked to comment, Mr. Bodin, now head of Arse at Microsoft, said he
knew nothing about this  'Atari  Corp.'.  and  asked  if it manufactured washing
machines because his had recently broken.



          Why, Alastair, Why?
          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
          Why
          Oh Alastair,
          Why are you so rubbish?
          More useless than flying fish,
          More stupid than Ocean Colour Scene,
          Disaster stalks your every dream
          And failure is your best friend.
          But at least now you have yourself to lend,
          And PC owner's everywhere can share
          Your competence, skill and deep care,
          As well as dedication and loyal nature.
          We salute you sir,
          May your dog pioneer a career in purring,
          May your cat wear a large and graceful hat,
          And may you be the first man on mars,
          And the last man off it.
          Amen
          Aman..?
          Anonce.



DID YOU KNOW: Alastair Bodin fact [2]

     Alastair Bodin has an irrational  fear  of  walking across the road.  Every
time he attempts to conquer this fear he collapses in a quivering heap, thinking
that an enormous, headless chicken is about to run out and flatten him.



          The Demonic Alastair Bodin
          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
          It lurks down,
          Under that mundane exterior
          Stained with the poison of the uninspired,
          It's alien mind whirling with possibilities,
          Attacks, counter-attacks,
          Defensive blocking strategies.
          Nothing will survive the touch of its host,
          All will crumble,
          All will fail...

          ...It is bored now,
          It has done its work;
          Riddled the company with so many holes
          It should fall apart without further aid.
          The time is ripe to progress.
          The lure of a bigger challenge is turning its horned head,
          Its blood is quickening,
          Its claws flexing in ecstatic anticipation
          A new gate is opening
          And Intel is inside...

     Alastair Bodin is actually an anagram for: 'I am a complete nonce who would
not even be capable of hanging myself if put in a room with a secure hook bolted
to a wall, given a length of rope  with  a noose already tied and a three-legged
stool to jump off.'  Honest.
