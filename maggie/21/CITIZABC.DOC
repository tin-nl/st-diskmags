                       ********************

œ130 to œ150. Widely available. Supplied with or without colour kit.

Ok its a bit of an old printer now  but  its still a current model and its new
to me. Possibly the last of the colour dot matrix printers as bubblejet prices
have fallen so much in recent months.

The whole concept of the ABC is  a  user-friendly,  easy to setup, easy to use
printer that has good basic results. Also  being dot matrix which is tried and
tested technology its reliable.

First impressions are bad. Its so bloody  ugly.  Its ok looking down on it but
from the front its got a bulbous  naff  sort  of look to it. Being Citizen its
all a bit plasticky and  light  weight.  They  don't build their printers like
Panasonic.

Feature wise its pretty good.  Theres  a  8k  buffer  (ok that bit's crap), 50
sheet autofeeder built  in  or  tractor  feed  option,  Plus  of course theres
colour. Its a 24pin printer and reasonably speedy.

The colour facility is basic and  slow.  I'm  not really happy with the yellow
output as its hard to see but then again  on white paper I suppose it will be.
I did a few screenshot printouts  and  was  reasonably happy with the results.
However the speed of doing this was very, very slow. Repeatedly going over the
same area hitting it with all four  colours  available on the ribbon to create
the full palette. I really think that  dot matrix printers aren't suitable for
printing colour  images  with  lots  of  colours.  There  best  left  to doing
individual text in different colours or  charts  that  only have a few colours
in. Bubblejets really wipe the floor with dot matrix in this area.

Normal black print is achieved  with  the  ABC  as  either  a single black ink
ribbon or the colour ribbon has  a  black  section  at  the top with the three
colours below. Its a fine LQ printer.

The question  many  may  ask  is  why  people  buy  dot  matrix  printers when
Bubblejets are now so cheap.  Well  the  ABC  is still cheaper than Bubblejets
especially colour ones by a few  pounds.  Running  costs are much cheaper. Its
more durable and makes a good introduction  to printing to the young who won't
be as respectful to it as an adult.

The disadvantages are its slow and  not  very good for detailed colour images.
Its noisy. It looks like Fisher Price on a bad day.

You also get a PC and Amiga drivers disk but obviously this doesn't help Atari
users at all.

Buy it for a brat or if your a tight fisted type.
