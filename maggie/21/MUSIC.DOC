       MUSIC: The  latest  (and  not  so  latest)  musical profferings 
        mulled over by our  vinyl-hungry  hoards.  Or  is it those new-
        fangled CDs these days?

BEN FOLDS FIVE "Ben Folds Five" (Caroline)

Ho ho, they've only 3 members and they're American, it sounds like the  
 album was recorded in a barn  with  2 microphones (listen carefully to  
 the final track and you can  hear  the stereo distort as someone leans  
 in front of a microphone)... but  Ben  Folds  is amongst them, and boy  
 can this guy play a piano!  BF5  the  Album  features some of the best  
 ivory-tinkling since... well since someone last did it better.

Parallels such as "Billy Joel  for  the  slacker generation" have been  
 bandied about, but this is an  injustice  to  BF and co: they have far  
 more wit and energy than BJ ever seems to have had. "Underground" is a  
 searing playful romp though the  schoolday obsession with heavy-metal,  
 while "Alice Childress" gives us a love-song of beauty above the dying  
 wastes of small-town America.  And  "Julianne"  opens  with the killer  
 lines "I met a girl, she looked like  Axl Rose/ Got drunk and took her  
 home and we slept in her clothes."  Buy this album NOW if you're sane.

OCEAN COLOUR SCENE "Moseley Shoals" (MCA)

OCS seem to have been one of  the  bands  to break big this year, with  
 three top 20 hits and this, a top ten album for a good length of time.  
 OCS are of course purveyors of "real  music" i.e. it has guitars in it  
 and no keyboards. But, hang on,  it DOES have sequenced keyboards, and  
 don't Underworld use guitars? The concept  of "real music" is becoming  
 decidedly tricky nowadays...

But back to Moseley Shoals, possibly the first piece of music that has  
 dared to be christened after a  certain West Midlands region since the  
 dreaded ELO's horrific "Birmingham  Blues"  single  in the 1970s. And,  
 shock horror, several parts of this album seem spookily reminiscent of  
 0their much-villified ancestors. But  while  ELO used technology ahead  
 of their time, OCS are a bit stuck.

Of course they love the feel  of  "old  music" and "live music" rather  
 than "real music" (read the sleeve  notes:  "There's so much nuance in  
 music, it's difficult to get it right with technology, capturing those  
 moments that make something unique and  exciting", er sorry lads, have  
 to stop you  there)  but  this  album,  in  contrast,  seems lifeless,  
 humourless, conservative  and  unwilling  to  really  move  forward  -  
 something The Beatles  and  The  Jam,  their  idols,  never  were. The  
 singles, "The Riverboat Song",  "The  Day  We  Caught  The Train" (The  
 Beatles without John Lennon's  intelligence)  and  "You've Got It Bad"  
 are the most passionate, and  most  catchy  (or  least boring?) of the  
 lot. The rest... well, I honestly can't remember any of them (SJT)


DODGY "Free Peace Sweet" (A&M)

Well yes, this is the worst title for an album this year, lacking both  
 wit and comedy, but I can happily report that the unhealthiest looking  
 band in Britain's  latest long  player  is  far  better than the title  
 suggests. Though not quite up there with 1994's brilliant "Homegrown",  
 which showed that the supposedly  difficult  second album isn't really  
 difficult if you put you're mind  to  it,  FPS is still by-and-large a  
 damn fine piece of  pop  flippery.  Tracks  like "Good Enough", "Found  
 You" and "Homegrown" are classic  examples  of  summer pop with killer  
 tunes and decent lyrics.

The problem starts  when  the  Dodgsters  try  to  invest "meaningful"  
 messages and epic scales ("One Of  Those Rivers" and "U.K. R.I.P." are  
 good examples) into their trusty pop-rock framework. It didn't work in  
 the 1970s and it won't work now, sorry. And who thought of putting all  
 those twiddly interludes  between  the  tracks?  Nevertheless, a great  
 tape/CD to hum along to in the  car  this summer. By the time you read  
 this, though, the winter will be drawing in (SJT)



CAST "All Change" (A&M)

...and here are another band usually  mentioned  in the same breath as  
 Ocean Colour Scene. Those cheeky  scally  Scousers have teamed up with  
 big-name producer John Leckie (Stone Roses, Kula Shaker, Scarlet (!!))  
 to record this album, and it  shows  when  compared to the OCS effort.  
 Musically, they're very similar - a  couple of whistlable tunes, stick  
 to a drums/ bass/lead/vocal setup and bung in a couple of slow ones to  
 fill  the  CD  up  ie.  nothing  special,  apart  from  the  wonderful  
 "Walkaway". What sets it slightly above  it from "Moseley Shoals" is a  
 sense of scally humour and realism: Cast know they just make their own  
 thing, attitude  isn't  important.  Hence,  a  better  album  but less  
 interesting muso live performances. It's, well, All Right.

PS. Did you notice I did this review without mentioning The La's once?  
 Oh dammit (SJT)



VARIOUS ARTISTS "Underwood" (Sub Rosa)

Available for less  than  a  fiver,  and  featuring  11  new tracks by  
 artists from the avant-garde Sub Rosa  label, this is intended to whet  
 your appetite for their adult releases.  Great idea! The problem is...  
 it's pants. Even comparatively well-known names such as Scanner (Robin  
 Rimbaud, the  man  who  recorded  cellular  'phone  conversations  and  
 created some viciously scary  but  addictive  listening)  and Mouse on  
 Mars fail to drum up  anything  truly  creative or stretching past the  
 cliche ambient world of excessive reverb,  minor keys and effect pedal  
 tweaking. Only the opener, Nus's "Lament", with a tortured male vocal,  
 Islamic Diggers' "Burroughs  Don't  Play  Guitar",  and the pleasantly  
 neat  drum'n'bass of Bill Laswell  rise  above the expected. Listen to  
 Orbital's  "In  Sides"  to   find   out   how   a  really  atmospheric  
 ambient/techno album is constructed. (SJT)
