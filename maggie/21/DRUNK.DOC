                      by Kev "Taffy" Davies

Don'ts
-------
The following induce vomiting or nausea.

 1. Reading a scroll text (particularly the ST News ROXL scroller,uck)
 2. Using flickerlace (as if things aren't bad enough as it is).
 3. Listening to chip or C64 tunes (nuf said, although everyone else    
    loves C64).
 4. Turning the lights down and watch "The Lost Blubb" demo.

    (Actually,  I disagree,  ever tried watching the Mugwumps 
    'Psychedelic Knockout'  demo with the lights down,  now 
    that one is a *real* chunder inducer! - ED)

 5. Trying to play Llamazap (why bother you can't stand so what chance
    do you have).
 6. Betting your mates you can swallow your mouse whole(you may manage 
    a PC mouse though).
 7. Eating your mouse mat (fibre may be important but...).
 
The following could damage your Atari.

 8. Vomiting over the keyboard (Do I really need to add additional 
    comment).
 9. Urinating over the keyboard (ditto).
10. Using the disk drive slot as a toaster.
11. Falling asleep on your Atari (you may dribble into it). 
12. Chewing the power cable (no fibre there).
13. Do not release your Falcon into the wild with the words "Fly free
    my friend"

Do's 
----

The following will ensure your Atari is unharmed.

14. Covering your entire set up with transparent polythene (projectile 
    vomiting can seriously damage your computer).

The following may help in the sobering process.

15. Playing your favourate dance type MOD file at full volume while 
    dancing to it (well at least you will think you're a good dancer).
16. Using the power lead as a form of electro-shock treatment by
    pushing your fingers into it when the power is on. 
17. Holding the Atari to your churning stomach as a kind of electric
    hot water bottle.
18. Staring at the green desktop screen as a form of self hypnosis.
19. Using the mouse and icons as self co-ordination tests.
20. Playing yourself C64 tunes (risking vomiting) as mental torcher,
    thus encouraging a speedy recovery.
21. See point 1-12 as you always feel better after chucking.
