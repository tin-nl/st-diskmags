Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the closure of Atari World earlier this year it has just been 
announced ST Format, the final UK newstand publication, has also closed. 
It's the end of an era in the UK which for the first time since 1987 has 
no Atari newstand presence.

The men in grey suits are telling us to move onto other platforms but hang 
on a minute, let's take stock of the situation...
- Atari machines can be purchased and repaired on a shoestring
- Atari machines can produce superb printed output
- Atari machines can surf the Internet and run BBSs
- Atari machines can form the nucleus of a digital music studio
- New software of better quality than ever before is still being released!

That doesn't sound like a dead platform! The Atari platform has been 
emulated by just about every other platform, we're owners of cult 
machines! Have you ever noticed ex-Atarians animatedly talking about the 
'Good old days' it's a feel good factor missing from all the current 
machines.

We don't need a new platform but we do need information and a printed 
magazine is undoubtedly the best way to ensure we see in the new 
millenium!

Apart from a darn good read the other thing most of us like is some new 
software to play with. The Reader Disk concept offers all readers the 
chance to get their hands on the hottest new software around along with 
exclusive versions not available anywhere else. We intend to offer one 
Reader Disk to accompany each issue, buy it or not, the choice is yours!

What we need, now more than ever before, is your support. It's going to be 
tough to keep going so we're initially planning bi-monthly releases -but 
this could change, it's really up to you! Instead of wishing us luck post 
a cheque to reserve your copy today!


Ordering
==========================================================================
As we're sure you'll appreciate launching a new magazine is a risky 
business requiring pinpoint budget management. Our print run will be 
conservative and we don't expect to have a stock of back issues.

We're not a newstand publication so don't bother looking in the shops. The 
Atari platform needs this magazine and we need your subscription so do 
yourself and us a favour, take out a subscription or order an evaluation 
copy today!

>>> Fast feedback request -->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
If you're on-line we'd like to hear from you right now! We're keen to get 
an idea of demand for the mag. To reserve copies send an empty email with 
the title line: KEEP and if you'd like two copies simply add the number 
afterwards: KEEP 2 etc, thanks for taking part!

Subscriptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of you (and most of us) lost money following the Atari World debacle 
and we're determined not to make the same mistake. Atari Computing 
subscriptions are refundable at any time. Cancel your subscription in 
writing and we'll return any outstanding credit to you, minus a deduction 
to cover our costs. If you order an evaluation copy we won't cash your 
payment until we've printed the magazine, simple eh?

If you're outside the UK
------------------------
- Make certain your payment is *in Sterling* drawn on a *UK* bank address
  The following methods work:
  -International Bank draft/cheque in Sterling
  -Eurocheque made out in Sterling
  -International Post Office cheque payable in Sterling
  -Cash, Sterling, in a registered letter!

Country specific information
----------------------------
Canada:    Canadian Post Office money orders made out in Sterling are 
           perfect and inexpensive!
Australia: We don't want any of your pretty plastic Aussie dollars :-)
(N/Z)      Get down to your local Post Office and get a money order made 
           out in Sterling, it's not expensive.
Europe:    In general Post Office money orders or Eurocheques are the best 
           way to pay.
USA:       What a nightmare! Can we suggest a day trip to a Canadian post 
           office? An International money order (add œ5 to order total) 
           made out in Sterling drawn on a UK banking address is currently 
           the best solution.
           Sterling Amex travellers cheques (add œ5 to order total) or 
           cash, Sterling, in a registered letter are acceptable.
