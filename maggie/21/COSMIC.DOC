"Wow! Cosmic man!" The title sounds like it has been dragged out of the
70s, perhaps from a freak brothers  comic. Unfortunately the game isn't
littered with acid casualties, and there  are  no flares or big collars
to be seen.

Cosmic originates from Germany. It is  the Brainchild of Markus Binder,
who is also responsible for such titles as "Enemy War" and "Solataire".
It is good to see someone writing new games for our beloved bird.

Cosmic is a shoot-em-up, but not  one of the horizontally or vertically
scrolling variety. It is  a  3D  shoot-em-up.  You  fly  down a texture
mapped tunnel and laser down the oncoming aliens.

Your gun sights are controlled with the  mouse, so the game feels a lot
in style like classic  coin-op  (and  racehorse)  "Operation Wolf". The
sights pulsate nicely  making  them  always  easy  to  locate  over the
background.

The game itself runs in 320  x  240  true colour mode. Unfortunately it
doesn't do a setscreen call itself  so  you  have to mess about and set
the desktop into the right resolution, which  isn't too bad if you have
a VGA monitor, but  on  an  RGB  you  will  find the nearest compatible
desktop resolution is 320 x 200 so you lose 40 lines of action!

The actual  "texture-mapping"  is  precalculated,  but  it  still works
surprisingly well and it is nicely  depth shaded. The aliens themselves
are not so impressive, in this preview version they are simply coloured
squares but no doubt this will change in the final version.

The text accompanying the demo  informs  us  that  this is "the texture
tunnel section" suggesting there will be other sections of the game.

If texture-mapped 3D shoot-em-ups are  your  bag,  then you should give
this game a look. Cosmic - it's out of this world!
