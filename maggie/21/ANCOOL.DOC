                             By A N Cool!! 

A major blast from the past makes it into this issue with a new  Falcon 
demo release, which is not even very slightly sheep related, no honest!

AN  Cool was always better known for his ST works,  indeed considered a 
legend  on  that platform..  His early work with the  extremely  famous 
Carebears  led onto the famous/notorious TCB Tracker,  a major item  of 
interest  in very early Maggies,  (and also my first 'serious' software 
review!) He went on to produce the rather good 'M-demo' series,  with a 
heavy emphasis on getting the best out of the ST sonically, then he got 
a Falcon..

Not  a  lot happened there,  as we saw a very brief effort  called  the 
'Lame  Demo' which came with the self-disparaging advice that the  demo 
'wasted hard disk space'.. Then nothing more for about three years..

The  release of this demo is as unexpected as,  well a very  unexpected 
thing  arriving  in  the  post,  perhaps the last five  issues  of  'ST 
Beermat' diskmag, with its new Falcon enhanced shell program would only 
be  slightly  more  surprising than seeing a new Falcon  demo  from  AN 
Cool.. But here it is!!

The  'Crstal  Demo',  to give the demo its proper title,  needs as much 
memory as something like 'Godload' can provide,  and looks suspiciously 
RGB  monitor  only..  The  first thing that comes along are  the  intro 
credits,  which  are  in the style of M-Demos in the past,  but with  a 
couple of significant changes,  the '1996' date on the credits, and the 
extremely high quality soundtrack that is in evidence..  The rest of it 
is ST-colour but high quality work,  as an imp from hell bounces up and 
down in time to the changing text on the page..

A  change  of  soundtrack announces the main part  of  the  demo,  with 
something much more substantial than the looped piece from before.. The 
soundtrack  is  the best on any demo yet,  and of the highest  quality, 
certainly  better than the Demolition demo reviewed last  issue..  This 
is, by far and away, the best part of the demo.. 

The  first  effects  are rather sparse,  with zooming and  fading  text 
captions  rendered  in uglyfontvision (TM)..  A fullscreen  targa  type 
still picture jumps in as if to avoid offending artistic sensibilities, 
and just as promptly, jumps out again..

Another return to the good old days comes with a sineous bottom  border 
scrolltext,  although this is extremely fast and fluid, and soon joined 
by  several more of its mates jiggling frantically across the  screen.. 
As in the past, the end result is extremely unreadable as well..

Some more of that zooming text later, and another fullscreen example of 
truecolour loveliness follows, then another effect that has had its day 
previously,  but  dusted  off  a bit and put in this demo  come  next.. 
Various  varieties  of  shade-bobs whirl around,  this is  another  old 
effect  to  be sure,  but with some fancy little ghosting effects,  and 
afterimage glare in places..

Another  entrant to the Demo Hall of Senile Dementia creaks  unsteadily 
to  its  feet  as a dot-tunnel cackles its way from  source  code  left 
buried on hard drives over two years ago..  Memories of Fried Bits 1994 
style  assault our senses as there are absolutely no embellishments  to 
this effect whatsoever..

A final,  and really rather good fullscreen still picture follows,  and 
then the final effect, which is probably the classiest single screen of 
the  demo,  with  a big dollop of 'design' in the top left corner of  a 
truecolour goldfish depicted swimming onto a screen consisting of  very 
high  resolution  swirly  spline  patterns  drawing  onscreen  in  huge 
numbers..  This rather handily,  is the probable end point of the demo, 
and can be left running as a very fancy screensaver,  ad infinitum..  I 
say  probable  endpoint,  as a quick return to the  desktop  ultimately 
needs  the rest button,  and we can't tell if there was more to come or 
not..

Ratings..

Graphix:- 81% - Nothing major going on in the 'live' effects,  but some 
really good still graphics to compensate..

Sonix:-  95%  - Some of the very best heard in a demo,  probably not  a 
module file, but sampled stereo sound.. 

(Atari Show noise pollution factor!) Probably just below the Cream  SID 
Chip player, but going to get a lot of plays nevertheless!

Gee-Whiz:- 60% - Buggerall new effects, but some nice embellishments in 
places,  however,  also  some  dusting  off of very old stuff  with  no 
attempt to disguise it..

Overall:- 83% - A likeable demo,  in spite of the great age of parts of 
it, better than the sum of its parts perhaps..
