Hi :)

 Yes got MAGGIE 20 many many  thanks, another great issue, bloody good
read, as usual though I will have one  moan, last issue it was the one
sided review of TEAM, this month it is the pathetic dribble spouted by
whomever, about the internet,  one  hour  in  a  cybercafe and the guy
writes an article telling everyone that the "truth" is the internet is
crap, not only was just about  every  word  bollox, but how can anyone
spend an hour on the internet  and  then  be expert enough to write an
article on the subject, hmmmm.

Otherwise :)))))  a fantastic  issue and as usual took a hell of a lot
longer to read than any magazine.

You will of course  by now be aware  of the demise of ST Format, after
we all knew for  about  a  week,  Frank  Charlton  decided  to make it
official on the internet. I have to say that it's a bad thing,issue 86
has gone to press and that's the last issue, I don't  feel the  ST  or
Atari  is as dead as  a doornail :) it will always be here, the  atari
scene, but it is a big blow and  even the people who spend  half their
life knocking ST Format must agree that it is a blow :(

On disk you will find an  exact  copy  of  my web page, exactly as you
would see it on the internet,  could  you  show  Dave Hollis a copy, I
couldn't use his picture4  he  sent  because  I  didn't  know where he
wanted it, plus there was something wrong with it anyway :)

As always Tony, it's nice to see you in here, and even nicer to see you 
active in various ways on the ST..  Yes,  I enjoyed the preview of your 
newest game you kindly sent me as well,  and look forward to seeing the 
finished  article at the Atari Shows in Sept with perhaps  an  extended 
showing on our stand??

With  regard  to  the 'Eddies Cybercafe' article,  which I  can  safely 
assume  is the cause of your current displeasure,  I can agree with you 
up  to a point..  Perhaps the writer was a bit hasty in condemning  the 
internet  on the evidence of one viewing,  perhaps he should have spent 
more time with it,  before writing the piece, indeed, perhaps tried out 
some of the other aspects of being online, and not just limited himself 
to a session of the World Wide Web..

However,  Ed (the writer) adressed two central points very forcibly and 
successfully  in  his article in my view..  The first of which  is  the 
expense of the thing..  Looking at it objectively, a fiver for an hours 
connection  could perhaps lose out in comparison with  other  competing 
entertainment media..  For that sort of money, you could have a trip to 
the cinema and have change from the experience (although not if you opt 
for  the overpriced snacks and drink!) If your tastes run to  something 
less  ephemeral,  perhaps *most* of an album-length audio CD,  which is 
yours to have and own and enjoy as many times as you like for the price 
of  a couple of hours connection..  Ditto for a pre-recorded  videotape 
from the bargain bucket section of WH Smith's..

You must admit that online time although great fun and groovy, is still 
a  damn expensive luxury for most computer users,  and will remain  so, 
until someone up there in telecom land finally gets their act  together 
on free local call access..

The  next thing is that Ed's distaste with the hype aspect is  a  point 
that also validates the article as far as I am concerned.. A good place 
to refer to now, is issue 8 of Atari World and the editorial written by 
Andrew Wright which starts:-

"I've said it before and I've said it again.  The Internet isn't ready. 
If it was sold over the counter in a box,  the Trading Standards people 
would have a field day - it doesn't deliver a fraction of the things it 
says  it  will  deliver,  even  if you've a fair idea  of  what  you're 
doing.."
 
And this from a person who knows a bit about the subject.. ;-)

Perhaps  the people you should be rubbishing for their almost  criminal 
irresponsibility, are those commentators who suggest that the 'Net is a 
breeze,  and mastered with a couple of clicks of a mousebutton..  It is 
they  who  caused the hype,  and the ensuing huge  disappointment  when 
things didn't work out for so many inexperienced users..  I wonder just 
how many online subscriptions will be renewed next year??

If the thing is sluggish, and drops connections, or fails to connect in 
the  first  place,  what  is a first time user,  conditioned to  expect 
near-perfection, to make of it all??

Without having had a lot of experience myself, I'm perhaps not the best 
person  to pontificate on the subject,  but all the available  evidence 
suggests to me that the Internet, in all its different guises, can be a 
cruel  mistress,  and  that  any love affair with her,  will come  with 
several  complicated and painful moments heavily mixed in with all  the 
fun stuff..

Anyway,  in  a 'bringing things to a close' manner,  I wish you all the 
best, and see you in September perhaps..

 Regards..
    Chris
