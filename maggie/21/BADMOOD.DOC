Having finally got hold of a compatible .WAD file,  time to see what all 
the fuss is about on this one..

Bad  Mood is steathily moving towards a full game,  so stealthily,  that 
the bad guys,  and assorted things to blow them away still have not made 
it into the game as yet.. Instead the actual 'Doom' environment has been 
tweaked up to the extent that it is a nigh perfect emulation of the real 
thing,  apart  from the apparent recently deserted air of 'Doom' after a 
really  heavy  all  night  party where the  flame  spitting  demons  are 
sleeping  off  a  major  hangover,  and  thus not  around  to  do  their 
particular thing..

Speed wise, it is fast enough although a little bit choppy on a standard 
16mhz Falcon..  Of course the 32mhz rated DSP chip is lending a very big 
hand  here  as you might expect..  One does wonder what additional  load 
putting  in  the  monster sprites and game intelligence  will  add,  and 
whether  a  standard  Falcon is man enough for the  job..  Bog  standard 
Falcon devotees may yet have to cast a wistful glance in this  direction 
and console themselves with the excellent (and only partially  textured) 
'Running' instead..

As this is a Doug Little inspired project,  one also wonders what impact 
the  Titan  designed 'Nemesis' accelerator will have,  and whether  this 
will  supply  the slightly absent fluidity to this game  engine,  or  if 
something even heavier duty is needed by the end..

The  version under consideration is v2.14 alpha,  which was released  at 
the  end  of June,  now with the ability to run Patch WADs  for  greater 
variation in level design etc..  Patch WADs are available,  literally by 
the  thousand,  and  feature tons of homebrew design efforts  from  DOOM 
bedazzled  PC  owners who just couldn't get enough  of  their  favourite 
game.. They  hang  off the main WAD,  and as a bonus,  don't take up too 
much space at all..

Anyway,  here  is  a little information from the man himself  to  finish 
with..   CiH - Aug '96..


*----------> Bad Mood v2.14 alpha release - 28/06/96 <----------*

Bad Mood is a special project planned as the basis for a PC Doom /
Doom II / Heretic compatible (pseudo) 3D game system for the Atari
Falcon & compatibles.

The system itself is intended more as a generic game engine than
any specific game, in order to allow open-ended flexibility and
therefore encourage development of a vast array of generically
similar games on the Falcon. Bad Mood itself is being developed
into a fully playable game in order to demonstrate the power of
this engine. Tools are also under development to allow players
to develop their own levels & even develop customised games to
their own specification.

There is still much to do before a final release, but with new
people joining the team, the project is becoming more and more
a reality.

This software is currently 'freeware', and is therefore available
free of charge. The Bad Mood developers retain the right to alter
this freeware status for future releases, although this is highly
unlikely. Sourcecode is also freely available.
