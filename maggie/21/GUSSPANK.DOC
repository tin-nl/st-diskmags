
                         Gus Spank Once More

This  time  around,  no  specific moans on the condition of  the  wider 
world,  letters of condemnation from outraged Bryan Adams fans continue 
to pour in,  after I slated their idol last time around,  death threats 
from  a gruff-voiced Irishwoman who sounded like Delores  O'Riordan  as 
well. So I'm writing in hiding on a safer topic this month.

There  is always one part of your body that you want to return  to  the 
manufacturer as irredemably crap.  With new cars,  its easier, you just 
have  to  put up with squeaky clutch pedals  and  factory-chipped  wing 
mirrors  for  but a short while,  and the red-faced  manufacturer  will 
apologise briefly and put them right for you.  With your own body, what 
you get, you're stuck with forever, warts and all (literally!)
 
This  is  an  eloquent comment on God as a quality  control  expert  as 
everyone comes out with a fault or lapse that is individual to them.  A 
lot  of  women  bemoan the thighs they are given,  more  insecure  male 
humanoids  worry about the size of their genitals,  some people  decide 
that  their face does not fit,  but in my case I've been saddled with a 
dodgy nose.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now my nose is an agent of free will.. It does what it pleases, when it 
feels like it, without bothering to let me know first. 

NOSE "Itching like mad, here goes!!"

ME "Just a sec, telling hands to sort out a tissue for you."

NOSE "Can't wait, gonna sneeze... NOW!"

ME "Merde!  Thanks for the 3-D snot textured sleeve, I've always wanted 
one of those."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
My  nose  has some frustrating depths to it that go beyond  the  common 
surprise sneeze scenario. It whinges and craves attention.

NOSE "Blow me, go ooonn, give me a blow."

ME  "But  I just did you two minutes ago,  and I've run out  of  tissue 
anyway, just shut up for a while."

NOSE "Blow meee, pleeease!"

Me "Shuttup!"

NOSE "Waaahhhh!"

ME "*SNURRFF!* Alright, where the f*ck is it all coming from anyway?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Depths  that go back further into your skull than you  suspected,  what 
room  is  left for your brain after the sinuses have  annexed  all  the 
available lebensraum in your cranial cavity?

NOSE  (Teasingly) "There's this little bit right at the back you  can't 
get  to,  try to snork the other way and see if you can get it out that 
way."

ME  "SNORRK!  GRONNK!"  (Fgawds sake methinks I've woken up the  entire 
street   with   my  asthmatic  elephant  climbing   a   steep   incline 
impersonation!)

NOSE  (Hard taskmaster voice) "You're not trying hard enough,  keep  at 
it!"

ME (hernia time) "SNAAAAUUUURRRGGHH!" (ahhh, got it!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compensations are few and far between..

NOSE  AS VOYEUR "Get a load of that new bird who's started work  today, 
really  nice perfume,  and don't you love the way it mixes in with  her 
hairspray, phwooaarr!"

NOSE  AS GOURMET "Mmmn,  the '85 Chateau Wotzisbollocks definitely  has 
the  edge with a more tangy,  flowery get you pissed quick factor  over 
the  cheapo  stuff  with a garish label and screw top  cap  which  just 
smells like alchohol flavoured spew."

NOSE  AS  POINT OF ENTRY - Less said about that,  the better,  although 
hundreds  of dead and barely alive rock legends could probably write  a 
couple of pages on the variety,  powdery nature, and long term damaging 
effects of the substances inhaled therein.

And that's about it really..
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Noses  are  also  the  first  to go down if there  is  a  cold  in  the 
vicinity.. 

THROAT "Now look nose, I was here first with the symptoms!"

NOSE "Ahh sorry, can't talk to you now, I'm feeling ill."

And usually the last to recover.

NOSE "Three weeks later,  and it's still coming out dayglo green! great 
stuff!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gus  Spank conclusion:-  Noses are dangerously strong  willed  bastards 
and will always get the upper hand of you!
