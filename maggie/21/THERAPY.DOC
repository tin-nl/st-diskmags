                    (Therapy Symposium Demo Entry) 

I  first saw this one at various stages of being made at the  Symposium 
convention in April, and this review is one way of tying up some of the 
straggly loose ends from that event.. This demo did manage to go as far 
as  winning  first  prize,  unfortunately from a limited field  of  two 
entries  (the third entry from Absence did not materialise due to  hard 
disk  gremlins  -  maybe  Lazer should give us  the  address  of  their 
hardware  suppliers so we can go around and beat the sh*t  out  of them 
for  supplying  such poor quality merchandise!?  - Hey,  they  weren't 
Atari/Seagate drives by any chance, were they!!)

Anyway,  to get to the point and cut out the unecessary digressions the 
Therapy demo (I'm not up to the German name!) was an interesting  entry 
in a number of different ways..

It  starts off by being a bit of a fussy sod as to what it will run  on 
exactly..  Mr  Pink  acquires the first UK bound copy of this work  and 
tries to run it - no result..  After some more fiddling, and a detailed 
internal  massage he discovers that a maths co-processor is  needed  to 
run  the  demo,  a  bit  of a first for  any  non-raytracing  software, 
definitely the first for an Atari demo, and rather a pain as a 68882 is 
conspicuous by its absence in his Falcon..

Step in CiH who did buy an FPU last Xmas without really thinking  about 
it,  so it is he (me!) who gets to try out this demo..  Even now, it is 
still not all plain sailing,  rather a float around Falcon screen modes 
of the rough and choppy variety..

The textfile supplied with the demo suggests 640 x 400 /16 colours mode 
with  all accessories scrunched from memory,  but this gets me nowhere, 
apart  from  some  screen  mess and  bombs..  Having  had  very  recent 
experience of 'Spice', the rather neat 'Defender' clone for the Falcon, 
I  try out truecolour,  where 40 columns gets us into the intro and  no 
further, but truecolour and 80 columns finally does the business..

It is with fingers crossed, I'm now watching the demo..

The first thing that greets you is the rather familiar music from Fried 
Bits '94,  yes, the middle tune from the 'Autowaschen Verboten' demo as 
it grinds into action..  Ohh dear, no original new music here, and we'd 
thought  that  this  was only a preview tune to get it  into  the  main 
competition  in  the limited time then available..  Surely a  new  tune 
could have gone into the final release??

A slightly rushed looking morphing and breaking intro text is the first 
visual contact we make with the demo which then leads rapidly into  the 
first  proper effect,  and a good one it is too..  A fullscreen full of 
nicely rendered water droplets sits in blue repose,  a 1990s version of 
the old Thalion logo screen perhaps? Instead of a logo, we get a series 
of fancy transparent distorting glass style magnifiers in a variety  of 
shapes and forms,  a time worn effect perhaps,  but very well presented 
here..

The  next new effect is another variation on an old theme,  with a very 
fancy  zooming  and  scaling screen composed of  a  multitude  of  tiny 
pictures forming a tile effect.. In this case, it seems a thousand eyes 
are staring at you,  and zooming and rolling about in the style of H.R. 
Giger,  the artist from 'Alien'.. A novelty for this is the addition of 
a  vector  latticework grid superimposed on top,  which also spins  and 
rotates to its own unspoken rhythm.. The grid is a solid metal 'rusted' 
look  affair through which you can see the 'Alien eyes' zoomer,  as  if 
caged in a rusty prison..

The next one is a strange one,  a sort of tunnel,  but done very chunky 
with squared off pixels,  and slowly changing colour throughout.. Not a 
very neat screen,  as it is sort of a fullscreen effect, but the bottom 
fifth of it remains unused..

The next series of effects gives the reviewer some relaxation with some 
tried and tested 3-D.. 

A lightsource shaded flat square is turned on its end, then it distorts 
and contours to turn into a little piece of landscape, changing all the 
while..  Abruptly turns into a shaded solid cube, which then also warps 
and  distorts  as if someone is pulling at the  corners,  and  changing 
colours  all the time..  Other polygons respectfully take their turn to 
do much the same sort of thing..

A  tricky little minx of a truecolour plasma/fade effect is next,  as a 
small  logo triumphantly discards countless carbon copies of itself  on 
the  screen  in  a rippling flamelike  spinning  motion..  Again,  done 
before, but again, presented very well here..

(Mystery  intermittent  demo effect - A lingering kiss  of  a  z-Buffer 
between two soli 3-D polys of differeing colours.. Only sometimes turns 
up?!)

Another tunnel effect ,but something new here, as someone has put their 
rendering  software  to good use to produce a tunnel made up  of  solid 
blue plastic-style tubular bars which recede into the middle  distance, 
and  are joined by segments in the middle to add to  the  space-walking 
effect..  This  tunnel  also  distorts and moves sharply from  left  to 
right.. Nice idea, good effect..

As  a penultimate sort of thing,  we get to see a carefully done  glass 
multi-faceted  diamond  polygon with a lot of  multicoloured  shading.. 
Very  much  the sophisticated city cousin of the good ol'  country  boy 
Glenz  Vector  and another favourite part of this demo  of  contrasting 
parts.. 

Finally (on my machine at least, a welcome change of music to something 
original,  and  a  rather long and badly spaced greetings  and  general 
chit-chat  text..  At  least we find out why the demo got out as  half-
finished as it did, as the Symposium organisers were not helpful at all 
with certain aspects of the soundtrack and certain graphics (when  they 
were not out there driving the shuttle bus, I presume!)

I'm not sure if the is more to come, but this Falcon has had enough and 
plops and crashes in a most ungentlemanly fashion..

Ratings..

Graphix:- 82% - Not a lot of hand drawn material, but good presentation 
of what was there, decent use of colour in the demo..

Sonix:- 75% - Disappointing re-use of old modfile compensated by rather 
spiffy multi channel effort at the end of the demo..

Gee-Whiz:-  70% - Not a lot new at all,  I did like the plastic  tunnel 
though..  The  difficulties in setting up and running the demo are  not 
what is expected at this stage now..  Surely a better method than trial 
and error must be available?

Overall:- 75% - A nice demo,  dragged down by rough finishing in places 
and poor debugging, could have done with a few more effects really.. 

NB. If this is a preview version only, I'm quite happy to re-review and 
amend these ratings if there is a finished product lurking around..
