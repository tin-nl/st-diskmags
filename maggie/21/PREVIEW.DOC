A  little  new info since Maggie 20 was released onto  an  unsuspecting 
world..

Reservoir Gods re-enter the building..
Mr  Pink is currently hard at work on his latest gaming opus,  which is 
confidently  expected  to  have  got as far  as  the  advanced  preview 
version, by the time this issue goes to press at the end of September.. 
Information  suggests  it  is  a  resurrection  of  the  long   delayed 
'Spyhunter' game for the Falcon..  This should be available for viewing 
on the Maggie stand at the Atari Shows in September..

Tony Greenwood goes 'Super' Sonic!
An  Early Beta of Tony Greenwoods follow up to Island Strike  (reviewed 
elsewhere  this issue) has arrived at Maggie GHQ..  The as yet untitled 
game  does  follow  on  from his description of it  in  his  Maggie  20 
interview,  it  is  indeed  a platform game,  it does have a huge  play 
area.. Parts of it are slightly reminiscent of Sonic the Hedgehog.. The 
graphics  look rather good for a production of this type,  with more to 
come,  and  there are also some slight STe enhancements with additional 
DMA sounds to back up the chip-generated spot effects..

According  to  my  information,  this  should be  actually  ready,  and 
released at the September Atari Shows, hopefully more on this one a bit 
nearer the time..

And according to even more recent info (early Sept) The game now has  a 
name, 'Heartland(s)'..

And this from Croft Soft...

I'm afraid that's it for now,  although there is news of loads of other 
developments scattered all over Maggie..
