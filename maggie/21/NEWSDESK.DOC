[] TRAGIC TAT  CONDEMMED  TO  SECURE MENTAL UNIT
News has just come in that Tat "Steve" Tattersall, coder of much fabbo
demo stuff,  was  today  spending  time   in   the   Hollyoaks  secure
hospital for the  mentally   ill   in   Lancashire,   believed  to  be
suffering  from "Bauhausosis",   a   rare   form   of  mental  illness
brought  on  by   a  combination   of   stress   and  taking   graphic
design  textbooks   too  seriously.   Mental  health   officials  were
alerted  to Tats' perilous state of  mind  by an article in  Maggie 20
entitled "Design and Demos".

Obviously, if Tat was to stand any  chance of recovery they would have
to act immediately.  The police were  called,  and forced entry to his
flat by  dressing  up  as  the  entire  membership  of  Aggression and
shouting "Look Tat, here's our Motion  Blur  demo" in a Finnish accent
through the letterbox. When  the  police  entered  the  room they were
horrified by the sight that greeted them. Hundreds of copies of "Edge"
magazine were blatently  strewn  about,  showing  explicit pictures of
Japanese console games that would  not  be  released  in  the UK for 8
months, complete with feeble  reviews.

Even  more disgusting were  the  many   rancid  doughnuts  they  found
which  had  had  triangles  and  measurements  drawn  all over them in
felt tip pen.  Police  later  found  a  Sony  Playstation  hidden in a
cupboard,  along with a notebook in which was written both the numbers
of polygons  on screen and  the  frame  rate  of various games for the
console.

Faced with this evidence, they had  no  other option but to commit him
to the  secure  hospital  before  he  had  the  chance  to  do himself
irreversible   mental  damage  by  attempting  to  program  a  PC   in
assembler.  Although  Tat  is  now   making  a steady recovery, mental
health officials believe  that  if they  had  not acted when they did,
Tat could now  well   be   employed  as  a  "Design  And Demo Studies"
lecturer at a university.  We   all   wish  Tat  well and hope he will
soon be back on his feet again. We  also hope that this fine coder has
a good sense of  humour  too.  Get  well  soon Tat!

[] SPIRITS GIVE FIRST  INTERVIEW  SINCE  CAUSING  ENTIRE  ATARI  SCENE
TO HATE THEM
The Atari Scene  Newsdesk  phonelines  were   buzzing   today with the
sound of top God Squad ex-demo  group  "Spirits"  as they talked to us
about their plans for the future. "It has been all go since we won the
prize  which  we  didn't   want    but    accepted   anyway   at   the
Symposium,"  said lead  accoustic  guitar  strummer  and  flame effect
coder Pious, in  rather  bad English,  "we  intend to use the money to
travel  to  the  North  Pole  and  build three giant crosses which can
be seen from  space,  just  like  in our  demo at the end. This way if
any aliens  come  to  invade the Earth,  they will see the crosses and
be filled with the  love  of  The  Lord  and  go and blow Mars to bits
instead."

[]  HUGE  ATARI  TREASURE  HOARD  DISCOVERED IN TAUNTON TRIANGLE
A  massive   collection   of   mythical    Atari  stuff  was  recently
discovered in the mysterious  region  of  England known as the Taunton
Triangle. This included all those  games  that  demo writers said they
were writing in their  scrolltexts   around  1990,  and  the last five
issues of ST Beermat. Also rumoured to have been found there was an ST
Basic language disk that had not been formatted over, but this is just
way too outlandish for us to  believe!

[] CRAPNESS OF  PC'S  ARCHITECTURE  AND  PROGRAMMING  GOES  BEYOND THE
LIMITS  OF  SATIRE
How is it possible to satirize PC's  when quotes like this  turn up in
magazines?  "When I first ran the game  on  a 486DX-50 with 8Mb of RAM
and a triple-speed CD I didn't  find  it  very enjoyable. This sort of
system isn't fast enough  to  cope  with  pulling graphics, speech and
music off the CD at the same time."

-Steve  Baxter  reviewing   LucasArts'  The  Dig  in Computer Shopper.

Professor  Cat  muses...  "It   is   obvious  that for parodying PC's,
conventional Newtonian laws  of  humour  cease  to  apply, and what is
needed is both a  General and  Special Theory of Humour for situations
like this when  the  formula   "reality>parody" equates. Are there any
Einsteins out there who would  like  to give it a try?"

[] ST FORMAT DEAD
 As  you  will  be  aware  by   now,   ST  Format,  the disk published
by Future Publishing has finally   come   to  an  end. The œ4.25 disk,
which came with a free magazine  sellotaped  to it to boost sales, was
finally ended because there  were  no  more commercial packages to put
on it. We are all very sad  about   this as this means there is now no
chance that we could get a   copy   of   Calamus or Cubase on the disk
instead of having  to  pay  full  price  for  it.

[] HUGE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE REPORTED IN  NORTH  WEST  ENGLAND
Astromoners  at Englands' Jodrell  Bank  research centre  unexpectedly
found  a  black hole in  an  unusual  location  earlier  this  week  -
Wavertree  Technology Park in Liverpool. This black hole  is  believed
to  have  been caused  by  the  immense  weight  of  all  the egos  at
Psygnosis finally collapsing in on themselves.

A spokesman for Psygnosis  said  today, "Look at this! The box has got
lots of fancy logos  and pseudo-Japanese  text all over it. That makes
it a much  better  game,   doesn't   it?   We're also doing an updated
version of Manic Miner, only  this   will  be  better as we've got the
licence from the National  Union  Of  Mineworkers,  so that having the
levels based upon actual  pit-workings  in  South  Wales  will make it
really  good  won't   it?"
