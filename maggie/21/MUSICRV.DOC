
              MORE MISCELLANEOUS MUSIC REVIEWS ...

As is usual within various members of the Maggie Team, some of us 
have  been buying some new albums and singles on CD recently -  a 
selection of which is reviewed here ...

ALANIS MORRISSETTE - JAGGED LITTLE PILL

One  of  the biggest selling albums of the year so far  has  been 
this third album from Alanis Morrissette,  whose only other claim 
to fame so far was that she starred alongside Corey Haim in 'Just 
One  of the Girls' - a movie that was reviewed some time  ago  by 
yours  truly.   I  say this is the third album as the  first  two 
didn't  make it to the UK,  and from what I have  heard,  neither 
were as good as this one ...

Jagged  Little Pill has a story to tell,  more so  Alanis's  life 
story of relationships with guys,  which appear to be more misses 
than hits, if you have listened to the album.

The album starts off with a good track called All I Really  Want, 
which  does  take  a bit of getting used to to  start  off  with.  
Following  on  from this is one of the best songs that  is  sadly 
censored whenever it plays on the radio, called You Oughta Know.

The  other  tracks  that follow on the album  are  of  very  high 
quality,  featuring some of her recent hits, like Ironic and Head 
Over  Feet.   All in all,  one of the best albums of the year  to 
date.   Alanis  also won the award for 'Best Foreign Act' at  the 
despised  Brit Awards party,  that so-called 'bash' that is  much 
maligned by many, including some of the bands that took part.
The album,  incidentally,  has gone platinum 4 times over now ... 
if you haven't yet got it, it is definitely a must buy.

PULP - DIFFERENT CLASS

One of the best British bands ever,  according to Chris Good,  is 
Pulp,  who have been around for a few years now but who have only 
recently made it to the big time.

I  must admit that 'Different Class' is certainly in a  class  of 
its  own  when listening to the various tracks.   All  of  Pulp's 
recent hits are on here,  such as Disco 2000,  Sorted for E's and 
Wizz,  and the mega worldwide hit 'Common People' - watch out for 
Weird Al's version of this soon too !!!

Pulp's lead singer is the ubiqituous Jarvis Cocker,  who, you may 
remember,  invaded  Michael  Jackson's show at  the  Brit  Awards 
party.   Since then,  not much has been heard of them.  You might 
be interested to know of the availability of a web page for Pulp, 
you can also get to this from the WAG pages.

Again,  this  album is certainly one to get if you don't  already 
possess it ... and compared to some of the crap that does make it 
in on albums, Pulp have a sound of their own .... and it's good.

SUGGS - THE LONE RANGER

For  those of us who were around in the early eighties  (I  think 
that includes everyone reading this) you will not have failed  to 
hear of a group called Madness, aka The Nutty Boys.  Madness were 
responsible  for  hit songs like 'Baggy Trousers' and  'House  of 
Fun'.

However,  times move on,  and whilst Madness as a group does  the 
rounds  of the small venues in England but still enjoys  hits  in 
the US,  Suggs has launched his own solo career,  and this is his 
first album to date.

There are some really good 'feelgood' tracks on here that reflect 
his  roots  in  Madness.   Songs like  'I'm  only  Sleeping'  and 
'Cecilia' are the hits so far, but some more are on the way.

Again, another album to get if you don't already have it.

Felice.
