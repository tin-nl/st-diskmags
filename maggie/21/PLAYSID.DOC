                              UTILITY: Cream go and revisit one of the 
                               golden ages of the computer music scene. 
                              RETRO-GRADER: tat

It seems that the more we  progress with technology nowadays, the more 
 we become obsessed with its history.  It  might be a false nostalgia - 
 anyone tried to play on the ST Spectrum Emulator and realised just how 
 bad Ant Attack  really  was?  -  or  maybe  the increasing hard-headed 
 commercialism and facelessness of the computer industry (and the games 
 industry especially) is becoming more of a turn-off than ever before.

The Commodore 64 and its users  have  been commemorated more than once 
 before in ST history. Already by 1987,  the BIG demo by The Exceptions 
 had honoured the C64  through  its  SID-chip  conversions  by Mad Max. 
 Cream have taken this a step  further  with  a program which plays the 
 original C64 code to almost 100% accuracy. Further versions offer even 
 better replay, we are told.

It's very simple - one .TTP program and a folder of data files to drag 
 and drop onto the TTP to  start  the player. Cursors select the track, 
 1-4 switch the channels on  and  off  and  up arrow speeds through the 
 music a bit quicker (this is the "hidden" key, by the way.)

To people who didn't experience the C64 in  the 1980s, it's a bit of a 
 culture shock to hear what comes  out  of your speakers the first time 
 you load a tune - Squeaky beeps and noises that sound like a strangled 
 pig? But after a couple of  minutes,  the brilliance of the whole idea 
 comes through. Listen to the  insistent  melodies and inventive sounds 
 of Rob Hubbard's "Sanxion",  "Delta"  or  "Auf  Wiedersehen Monty" and 
 you'll know what I mean. And the Falcon's high quality stereo makes it 
 sound better than ever.

The simplicity of the whole  thing  belies  the  levels of cunning and 
 ingenuity of the original Commodore programmers and musicians. Reading 
 the help file with the program tells you that this is no homage to the 
 C64 itself, but to  names  like  Rob  Hubbard,  Martin  Galway and the 
 Maniacs of Noise, people  who  were  really  inventive  with (let's be 
 honest here) a chip that really  wasn't  any  great shakes by the mid-
 1980s. By the way, how many games musicians can you name nowadays?

So it's hats off to Cream again for a great idea, presented neatly and 
 efficiently. A C64 chip  emulator  is  actually  a  lot harder than it 
 sounds, too - you've damn near  emulated a whole early computer system 
 by emulating its  main  processor.  Oh,  and  their system restoration 
 routines are some of the nicest on  the Falcon. This one's already got 
 a permanent residence on my tiny  hard drive alongside the best Falcon 
 demos.
