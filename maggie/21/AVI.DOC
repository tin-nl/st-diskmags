
                      The new AVI-QT Player v1.10 

At last, a long overdue utility for the Falcon, a proper fully featured 
.AVI and Quicktime (.MOV) animation player takes its bow.. 

No  disrespect  to the Dieter Fiebelkorn product which  has  stalwartly 
done  its 'one frame a second' type of thing up to now,  but we  really 
needed  something  better..  Actually this is an extrapolation  of  the 
original proto-player,  which was coded in 'C',  and was translated and 
improved in assembly language by the rather talented French guy,  whose 
name appears at the end of this review..

It  can play both principal animation formats,  although I've not  come 
across  any  Quicktime files to try it out..  However,  I do have  some 
.AVIs  in my possession on various CDs,  and gave them a spin up to see 
how it got on with those..

Reading  the  docfile  enclosed,   you  need  to  set  your  Falcon  to 
Truecolour,  (the  dirt slow in GEM mode) an alternative is a TT with a 
suitable  Truecolour  capable graphics card (at  least  32768  colours) 
which is the native system that the author developed this program  on.. 
This makes you think immediately that certain Falcon specific bits, ie. 
the DSP chip,  haven't been involved..  Plenty of RAM is suggested,  as 
the  author has come up with a novel way of getting the  soundtrack  to 
play with the video output..

A GEM dialogue box comes up when you run the program,  this is the main 
user  interface and you read the text contained therein..  Clicking  on 
this  brings  up  the  ubiquitious file selector,  and  you  load  your 
animation..  A  further  dialogue box containing information about  the 
animation  appears,  and you are given the option of having it with  or 
without  soundtrack (assuming audio is present) having  the  soundtrack 
synchronised,  or not, a big button called 'Go!', or not going ahead at 
all..

Most of the time,  you will want a soundtrack, and have it synchronised 
with the animation, so press 'go!'

A lengthy pause follows,  especially if you are loading from CD, as the 
soundtrack is loaded first,  stored in memory to await the main part of 
the animation,  and also converted to an STe friendly sound frequency.. 

The animation plays, the soundtrack tags along thanks to the miracle of 
DMA  access,  and  the  two  blend  together in  a  glittery  whirl  of 
multimedia.. STe friendly? Yes, another one of those cases where Falcon 
specific bits are ignored,  and the sound device used in this case,  is 
the  DMA stereo sample player as found in the TT and  Falcon,  although 
the  main  program uses specific features of the 68030  processor,  and 
can't  be  used on the STe..  It can support stereo soundtracks,  but I 
haven't  found  any  of those yet,  the animations I've  seen  so  far, 
preferring to use mono sound..

Trying it out,  the results were generally satisfactory, getting on for 
good..  The  animations on the 'Transmission' CD,  generally unviewable 
before,  unless  you  had reserves of infinite patience,  came to  life 
here,  especially when a soundtrack was included..  A series of timings 
taken  suggest  a  playback speed from 10 frames  to  14.8  frames  per 
second,  from a SCSI double speed CD (300kb/sec transfer rate) and with 
the  soundtrack  included..  Synching  the soundtrack meant  that  some 
animation  frames on the slower animations were left out,  but this did 
not  amount  to more than 30% of the whole and apart from  one  or  two 
pauses in the action,  did not affect the viewing quality..  The faster 
animations  played through in their entirety..  Sound quality was good, 
if  very loud on one or two films..  The 'Transmission' animations were 
shown as 192x144 images..

Trying  out  the  huge .AVI files on the NeoN demo  CD,  a  significant 
slowdown  was  noted..  These were displaying bigger animations  up  to 
340x252  pixels,  and were a lot slower than the 'Transmission' anims.. 
Trying out the Team Computers 'Ghost escaping from a computer  monitor' 
animation,  we  got  a wide range of results according to what we  were 
doing..

Worst case was from the CD with soundtrack synched with a lowly, not to 
mention  jerky 3.4 frames per second,  and only 14% of the total frames 
displayed..  Transferring  the file to hard disk eliminated some of the 
bottleneck,  as we got up to 6.3 frames per second, but the anim looked 
like  it  was going to crash any second  (25% of  the  total  animation 
displayed..)  Taking out the soundtrack pushed the playback up  to  7.2 
frames  per  second  (6.7 sec from CD) and you got  to  see  the  whole 
animation  too,  and it didn't look like it was going to fall over  and 
take your Falcon off to a dark place forever..

The  author  had his own selection of animations to try  out,  and  got 
anything  from a 74% success rate for combined animation and audio,  up 
to  92%  for  animation only,  or audio only..  There were one  or  two 
animations  that  refused  to run from the 'Transmission'  CD,  but  we 
assume  that  a  non-standard compression format was  used..  The  .AVI 
format  is yet another sufferer from that curse of computing,  the urge 
for   programmers  to  make  continual  small  incompatibilities,   erm 
improvements to existing code..

These tests were performed on a standard 16mhz Falcon and it remains to 
be seen how additional acceleration will affect the outcome (a possible 
update  on this with 'Nemesis' installed may be worth  looking  into..) 
The author's 32mhz TT should be more than up to the job of course..
