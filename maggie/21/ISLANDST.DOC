                           Stosser Software 

This  is the first appearance of Tony Greenwood in such a high  profile 
game  since the 'Hero' Disaster a couple of years ago,  discounting his 
various  good works with Stosser,  other disk mags,  and various sundry 
projects, which we won't of course because we're nice people!

Anyway,  Island  Strike  bears a cunning similarity to that doyenne  of 
heli-borne  shootemps,  'Desert  Strike',  with  more  than  a  bit  of 
'Choplifter' in there as well..  Cunning, in that Tony has opted for an 
overhead  view,  which  makes it into a sort of 'Gauntlet'  with   30mm 
cannon, Hellfire guided missiles, and 70mm FFAR unguided rockets..

One moment please..

GET A GRIP OF YOURSELF, YOU'RE NOT WORKING FOR ST FORMAT NOW!! 

Sorted that one out, I think..

Anyway,  this is Stosser Soft's latest release,  and is intended to get 
them back into the game making business after a longish time away..

Island  Strike is one of the new generation of STOS games,  a game that 
will  runs on any system from a 1 meg STFM upwards..  I am gratified to 
see  it working without any problems on my Falcon,  although the  price 
paid  is a lack of any machine specific enhancements.  What you get  is 
the same wherever you look..

The  presentation is bright and cheerful,  if fairly basic in  places.. 
The graphics are fine,if not stunningly glossy, but the main game comes 
with plenty of them,  and they are 'interactive' in that you can squish 
many  of  them with your all-powerful frontal  cannon..  This  includes 
several  little enemy soldiers who did not really want to  be  standing 
around  in  full  view in the first place,  various shooting  and  non-
shooting tanks,  tents,  bridges,  and little green blokes waving their 
arms frantically at you..  Ah, shouldn't have shot them up perhaps.. In 
considering the influences of different game genres,  you also notice a 
little  bit of 'Cannon Fodder' creeping in at this stage what with  all 
the death and carnage..

Sound  is  pretty  basic,  a  nice tune at the start  and  a  soundchip 
generated helicopter beat is all you get,  apparently, a lot of sampled 
effects  had  to be sacrificed early on to keep it  compatible  on  all 
machines..  Some explosions and dead and dying screams would have added 
a lot for the casual recreational psychopath like myself..

Gameplay is absorbing and your hands are filled with several objectives 
all  clamouring  to  be  fulfilled in  the  game..  The  overt  mission 
objective  is  to rescue the hostages we were shooting earlier,  and  a 
little scanner on the status screen tells you where they are.. You stop 
over them to collect them and the game moves to a brief animated rescue 
sequence..  In  addition  to  that,  the high command wants you  to  do 
something  a little bit more butch and blow up some bridges  as  well.. 
These are usually quite heavily defended in the time honoured manner of 
high value military targets down the ages..

What  you are left to figure out for yourself is the  self-preservation 
aspect,  as  fuel,  armour,  and  ammo,  roughly  in that order run out 
rapidly,  and have to be replenished from supplies left lying around by 
the  enemy..  A bit of help is give at the start as you are allowed  to 
select a co-pilot who gives a bit of help with one of these, so you can 
opt  for extra fuel/ammo/armour/map info according to  the  back-seater 
you  select to ride with you..  The rapid draining away of these  makes 
for  quite  a tough little game as a momentary  inattention  invariably 
proves fatal as you run out of something very necessary..

Yes there is a cheat which makes life a whole lot easier,  and no,  I'm 
not going to give it to you!! 

Completing  a level without cheating is an achievement  that  separates 
the gamesplaying men from the joystick waggling boys for sure..

The very best bit of news is that the game is Freeware!!

I would have liked a little bit more, say some extra weapons, such as a 
nasty  wide-area  devastating guided missile or something,  it is  very 
difficult  to line up on a target for a strafing run,  and this uses up 
more precious fuel/armour/ammo etc..  In keeping with the spirit of the 
game,  such a weapon should only be on a very limited supply.. Say also 
a  bit more variety in the missions,  as there were some juicy  looking 
enemy  headquarter  buildings  which  were  strangely  immune  from  my 
bullets..  Bridges  get  a bit tedious after a while,  and are a sod to 
kill as well..

However,  all  being  said or done,  definitely a worthwhile release by 
Tony and the gang..

Ratings..

Graphics:-  74% - Not the prettiest ever,  but does the job well,  some 
nice 'interactivity' with the landscape..

Sound:- 50% - Not a lot here,  just a helicopter sound effect and title 
music.. Would have liked more here..

Playability:- 80% - Well thought out, and indeed, more than a little on 
the  challenging side,  but without getting frustrating or impossible.. 

Overall:- 79% - A competently handled nice little game..
