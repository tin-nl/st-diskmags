                         Tenth Dirkiversary!!

Yep  it  all started back in issue twelve folks,  the longest  running 
regular  column  in  Maggie,  which  was originally  intended  as  the 
successor  to  'Rottspot'  and  also pencilled in  to  appear  in  'HP 
Source',  the  diskmag  that  never got going..  Dirk has pleased  and 
entertained in Maggie ever since though, and has made countless scores 
of new readers feel right at home.. (You're making this bit up! - ED)

Anyway, onto a new issue..

                        ST Format close down.. 

And  its  goodnight from them in a very hectic and busy  period  since 
Maggie  twenty  was released..  The sequence of events goes  something 
like this - Early July,  rumours about STF issue 86 start to appear on 
the  BBS's..  The specific meat of the rumour has it that STF 86 is to 
be  their final issue..  At this stage,  news is still confused as one 
well placed source (not named here to save his embarrassment) tells me 
that  STF  are  still funded to the end of 1996,  and even  that  Nick 
Peers,  the  editor is fighting to regain some of the lost pages  back 
for  that  ever  shrinking mag..  About a week after that  it  becomes 
official that STF is to close from Frank Charlton..

Indeed  when issue 86 appeared in early August,  it did have a  couple 
of pages written as a farewell to the Atari community, and suggestions 
to  contact  alternative media such as the diskmags..  Maggie  gets  a 
specific mention at this point - Yeeaahh!

It does not contain mention of the *new* Atari paper mag coming  along 
shortly,  as STF 86 went to press before this was finalised,  which is 
where we now go to..

                       Atari Computing open up!

To fill the gap left by the departure of ST Format, Atari World et al, 
another paper mag is in the process of being born..

Atari  Computing  is  the brainchild of various  people,  but  with  a 
central  commanding  role  assumed by Mike  Kerslake  (an  independent 
publisher  of  specialist  magazines,  who  happens  to  be  an  Atari 
enthusiast..)  Heading  up  the editorial team  are  the  not  totally 
unknown  figures  of Joe 'Atari World' Connor,  and Frank 'ST  Format' 
Charlton..  More  hard  information is contained in the press  release 
elsewhere in Maggie, but the following might be worth knowing now..

Atari  Computing is subscription only,  probably the only way a  paper 
mag can survive now..

Print runs are going to be quite low,  initially 500 copies,  so these 
may be in very short supply until the real demand for a publication of 
this type can be gauged..

Therefore copies should be ordered well in advance!!

And another thing,  we have our own guest pages, initally to be filled 
with back issue material pre-selected for the mag, but with the racing 
certainty that some original material, especially concentrating on the 
demo scene, will follow!!

This looks like a good one, and with our guarantee of quality, how can 
it not succeed!!

                        Atari Shows still on..

The  collapse of ST Format has not led to the forthcoming Atari  Shows 
at the end of September being adversely affected, indeed, according to 
Mike  Goodman,  there  is now even more interest in these  shows  than 
there was before.. 

Additionally,  these  shows will be graced with our presence..  yes we 
have our own stand space!!

Many of you reading this mag for the first time perhaps will have just 
seen us at the show,  and if you are now reading this column, a hearty 
hello  and  howdydoo to you all..  We are planning to have  Maggie  21 
ready for the shows,  and released at that time..  (Perhaps 'planning' 
is  too  strong a term,  more like 'hoping' to have the mag  ready  in 
time?! - Alright, we'll think of something..)


                        VoGue arrives in 1996  
 (World re-ignites burnt remains in vain attempt to be controversial)

Fresh  from  yelling that he has finally got a decent spec  STe,  John 
Nott  (aka "VoGue") in a shock move announced the acquisition  of  the 
assets of rival slacker RiCH-Tee,  Davey,  Tadpole and Associates in a 
sudden takeover bid.. John gets Rich's Falcon, the massive and largely 
uncatalogued  Falcon  Owners Group PD library,.  and eight  months  of 
unanswered  hate  mail left to him by Rich..  Also the  rather  spiffy 
(allegedly)  Diskmag  shell  program donated by Al  of  Psychosis  and 
unseen up to now.. (More on that in the diskmags section)

John  has a lot to do,  as well as running the Atari Net Locator site, 
he  has  to  try to restart FOG and the diskmag  from  scratch..  More 
on this potentially very interesting development soon folks..


                           Eddy Cyberpunk..   
 
I'm  not the only one to complain about the speed, or lack of it. Look
what  David Robinson  has to say  about the  Internet  in  his  "Under
Development" column in the August 1995 issue of Computer Shopper:
 -Ed Cleveland-

"Another  victim  of the  ultra-hype treatment  is  the Internet,  and 
especially the World Wide Web bit."

"At times the  responses are  so  slow  that  the  service  is utterly
unusable and make even old-style computers  like the ZX81 and Spectrum
look like greased lightning. A good example is trying to load the home
page for a Web search service like Alta Vista- I've known this to take
up to 10 minutes, which despite  my  shiny new 28,800 baud modem gives
an effective data transfer rate  of  under 100 characters per second."

"This is a far cry from, say, the  likes  of the Fiat car advert which
(supposedly) depicts an average home  PC  downloading and playing live
video across the Internet, a  task  which would require transfer rates
of around 250,000 characters per second  to do anything resembling the
effect shown on TV..."

Any other news? Well one thing  I found out after  reading the file on
how the screen in Doom is drawn, is what Aggression were up to. Notice
how in the 128k Super  Wolfenstein demo the  viewing angle rotates and
sways,  they've done  this purely because the Wolfenstein/Doom display
relies on  the fact that the walls are  always straight and the floors
are always flat AND they are always viewed at a  "flat" angle. So what
Aggression are doing here is basically showing off to those people who
have  programmed stuff  like this in demos,  unfortunately they're the
only ones who will understand how clever it really is!

The Spectrum game we  thought was Sim Netherlands turned  out to be an
educational  quiz upon  closer examination,  so  I don't think we will
send it to Rich Karsmakers after all.

                                      That's all, Ed!

I hope Tony Greenwood doesn't mind us sharing this interesting extract 
of  a newsgroup posting with you,  it sort of confirms something we've 
suspected about the users/gits on certain other platforms.. - CiH

 Hmmm, I recently got a copy of Power Basic for my PC, I lurked in
comp.language.basic.misc for a while, well a week or two, took and
read about a thousand posts, including the faq,

 I then asked a perfectly valid BASIC programming question, I got one
response,a most insulting mail stating that if i could not be botherd
to spell correctly or use a spell checker, then why should anyone else
bother to help me?, (my post was simple and understandable, but yes
spelt badley)

 From my short sharp experience, I would say that the ONLY friendly
and helpfull platform that does not expect x amount of dollars for
helping is ATARI, I found that it is not just a tale spread by
ATARIans, we really are the most helpfull :)

Well I think that just goes to prove what I thought all along!!


              Demon:- Well if writs the way you want it!

A  certain  newspaper has been getting itself in  trouble  with  Demon 
Internet  with  unfounded,  personally  libellous and dare I  say  it, 
ignorant  assumptions  about internet providers..  No,  it is not  the 
Daily Mail,  the main bastion of anti-internet prejudice and hysteria, 
but the broadsheet heavyweight paper,  'The Observer'..

They went as far as inferring that a director of Demon was virtually a 
child  porn  peddler,  the  headline went something like  "The  school 
governer  who  sells  access to photos of child rape"  which  did  not 
please  him at all,  and solicitors got onto the case..  Now you would 
have  thought  they would have been a bit more careful,  but it  seems 
that total ignorance of the subject you are slagging off is a  feature 
not  just confined to the lower level tabloids,  but regrettably now a 
standard  tool  of  what was previously thought to  be  the  'quality' 
press..

The  Observer,   upon  hearing  that  a  writ  was  in  progress  have 
backtracked  to  some  extent,  as  they owned up  to  their  coverage 
"betraying a lack of understanding of the internet.."

No  doubt other examples of press related shock horror  'coverage'  of 
the internet will come to light shortly.. We will have our say too!!


                           Un'appy Aptiva..

It  seems  that Ripley is not the only person to take issue  with  the 
existence  of  the Aptiva Multi-Tedia Home PC (see issue  20  'In  the 
Trashcan'),  as  the following from the 12th July issue of Private Eye 
reveals..

"Readers of Personal Computer World magazine were no doubt  enthralled 
to read the latest 'group test' of super fast PCs in the mag's current 
issue.."

"Eighteen models from various manufacturers were examined and reviewer 
Dylan  Armbrust was particularly scathing about one system -  the  IBM 
Aptiva.  Describing it as "like an old,  sick, family animal: it's had 
its day..  So the kindest thing is to put it down", he concluded: "Bad 
points - where do we begin? IBM's only chance is to give them away.""

"Hardly a glowing recommendation - so readers may have been  surprised 
to find,  later in the same issue, a PCW competition headlined "Go for 
Gold  -  Win  an IBM Aptiva",  in which the very same  machine  (which 
recieved  a  'value' rating of only 3 out of 10) is now  described  as 
"much coveted""..

Maggie reaction - !!!!???!!!


                     Red Dwarf VII - In the can..

Maggie editors favourite TV comedy series has now completed filming of 
the  very  long  awaited seventh series..  Filming  was  completed  in 
August,  but  the new series is not expected to be shown before  early 
next  year..  New filming techniques give the impression a much bigger 
budget has been spent, than is in fact the case..

A  well  publicised major change is the departure of Chris  Barrie  as 
Rimmer, he does appear in four of the eight episodes though, and there 
is  the probability of his return to series VIII which is due to  film 
in  1997..  A  "new"  regular character is the  arrival  of  Christine 
Kochanski,  or to be more accurate,  'Christine Kochanski from another 
dimension'.. This character is not going to be played by Claire Grogan 
who  was the original Kochanski..  The eight episodes will start  with 
the  characters  dead,  but with their quality of life set to  improve 
from there,  and culminate in finding Red Dwarf,  and will bring Holly 
back as well..

Amongst  other  treats,  a  spoof on BBC  historical  costume  dramas, 
namely  'Pride  and  Prejudice' is promised..  We  await  this  series 
keenly, and will evaluate for a future issue of Maggie..


                         Escom stop trading..

Escom stores are conspicious by their lack of openness at the moment.. 
A  lack of cashflow is thought to be the problem,  but it is  entirely 
possible  that  their handling of the Amiga after  Commodore's  demise 
fatally infected them with the 'Curse of the Wonky Workbench!'

Fit the following..

Before  getting  Amigas:-  Young  and  healthy  retailer  with  strong 
European  parent company,  opening shops all over the place and set to 
be major success story of the year..

After  getting Amigas:- Wrapped on knuckles by Trading  Standards  for 
selling PC kit 'incomplete' without pre-installed software, getting it 
in  the  neck  from irate Ameboid (l)owners for  not  promoting  Amiga 
properly, or at all in some cases.. Finally, going bust..

Commodore, who are still dead, had this comment to make..

......................................................(silence)..

(Well, they're dead after all!)


                       The End for this issue..

And that's it for this rather shortened version of 'Dirk', we just ran 
out of time to do any more, so this will have to do.. Hopefully, a bit 
more for the next issue of life's little absurdities..

Private Eye magazine as well..
