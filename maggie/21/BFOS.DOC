It would be nice to  believe  that  coders are not fundamentally stupid
and  rash  people,  and  that  they   are  not  responsible  for  their
sloppiness. All their errors are  the  result  of  some sort of X-Files
type conspiracy.

"Bugs From Outer Space" is a  demo  with  a checkered history. It first
surfaced at the demo  competition  of  Fried  Bits  3.  Here  it was up
against the might of EKO, Lazer  and  Avena and failed miserably. To be
fair, it was nowhere near complete  at  this  stage. BFOS version 1 was
more of slideshow with fancy fades than a demo.

Impulse are not ones to rest on  their laurels and decided to turn BFOS
into a proper full length demo  and  inject with some real Swedish demo
style.

BFOS begins with a small text screen. Here you can toggle the music and
internal speaker. You can  even  get  the  demo  to  play music from an
external source! You can also  type  in  the  secret code to access the
hidden screen from here.

A sample is played and  the  legendary  words  that began Star Wars are
displayed on the screen  "A  long  time  ago.  A  place far, far away".
Although this  is  a  paraphrase  of  the  original  I  think  it still
demonstrates  that  this  text  is   more   familiar  (and  holds  more
significance) to people of  my  generation  than  the  opening lines of
Genesis.

A rendered hillside appears and a  flaming comet descends from the sky.
This obviously is writhing with bugs which are waiting to burst out and
infect innocent programmers' code.

A rendered  logo  displays  the  name  of  the  crew  who  created this
masterpiece: "Impulse". A presents logo  pops  up  followed by the main
"Bugs From Outer Space" logo. This  has been redrawn since the original
release and looks better for it.

We are next presented with  a  starfield  overlayed with some one plane
text. This is just a link screen for the next effect, which is probably
the first screen on the Falcon to involve nuclear power and toilets.

A 3D toilet spins  about  the  screen  snapping  its  lid open and shut
angrily whilst a Nuclear logo  watches  sternly  from the top corner of
the screen. Such nuclear/toilet antics bring a whole new meaning to the
word "Windscale".

More polygons are on there way!  Next  up is rotating exploding 3D cube
whose six faces expand out from the centre of the object so you can see
their inside faces.

The next object looks  similar  to  one  featured on Impulse's "Angest"
demo. It is a vector  object  with  an  intricate mesh of gourad shaded
lines, only this time it is not spinning over a full colour background.
The final shape of this sequence is a triangular prism, and then we are
whisked into the next effect.

A text logo appears with the legend "Let Me Show The World In My Eyes".
The Gahan/Gore influence appears. This is  the Depeche Mode screen, and
fortunately it is not trying to  slash its wrists whilst simultaneously
overdosing on class A drugs.

At the bottom of the screen we have a fire effect that bears an uncanny
resemblence to the one  that  appeared  in  "Revelations" by Psychosis.
This burns unsteadily for a  while  before  fading smoothly off. Again,
this effect is put to shame a bit  by the one in the Spirits demo which
burnt with a power an urgency as  yet  unsurpassed. If we were going to
use thermometers to judge  these  sort  of  effects,  this one would be
"cooking nicely but not blast furnace levels".

Impulse lash out ironically at  the  French's  preference for design by
displaying a mushrom, a  plum  and  a  decidedly  unhappy banana in the
corner of the screen. The world then appears. Overlayed behind this are
the Sun, Moon and a massive CND  revival. Perhaps the bugs have come to
earth to resurrect  Michael  Foot's  flagging  political career. Donkey
Jackets out and its  off  to  Greenham  Common  for some serious lentil
worshipping.

The world appears on the  screen.  Protuding  from  the north pole is a
seriously large flower, a piece of  flora larger than Europe that would
happily cast a  shadow  across  half  the  globe.  We  suspect that the
influence of "Bobby the hippy ghost" on this demo is quite strong.

Gandalf's Worldclaw picture is now  displayed.  Another globe forms and
the world is mapped onto it.  This  sphere mapping object bounces about
the screen before disappearing off the left hand side. The screen fades
out neatly with the red, green and blue being separated.

The world then becomes part of the pattern on a rotating zoomer. Double
line mode is used to keep the  framerate smooth. This rotates and zooms
pleasantly enough, but  there  are  no  shearing  distorting effects or
perspective thrown in. The world changes to an eye, a piece of graphics
quite unsuited to this effect as it looks quite ungainly when zoomed.

Another nice rendered picture appear, this time it is supposed to be of
a wheel but it reminds me more of  the cover of Bob Mould's recent solo
album. A familar 3D object spins onto the screen. Yes its a Falcon with
a monitor! Even though  it  is  in  an  ST-style  box,  it is instantly
recognisable by its dark grey keys.

The monitor flickers to life  and  a  mini  version  of the gem desktop
appears. "Is this art  imitating  life?"  we  ask  in our best Guardian
critic voice. A demoscreen then appears  on  the mini Falcon. This is a
rotating mass colour. It expands from the small Falcon's screen to fill
the real screen, slowing down in the process.

Still this is well  designed  and  amusing  screen,  one that all Atari
people seem to enjoy immensely.

Continuing the Star Wars theme a  polygon  Tie Fighter bursts on to the
screen. This is pursued to a  larger  than life 3D Pacman, gobbling his
way through space. This is another amusing and bizarre scene that could
only have come from the twisted minds of Impulse!

The Swedish Flag that provoked such  loud  cheers  in Bremen in 1995 is
now displayed. A smaller replica flag  sprite  moves up the screen over
its larger brother. This  then  spins  round  revealing  itself to be a
translucent 3D polygon which cheerfully rotates off the screen. This is
neat little effect that isn't really on for long enough.

There now appears  my  favourite  part  of  the  demo  -  the greetings
section. Greetings list used to be long,  pompous and for the most part
tedious affairs, usually  contained  in  the  obligatory scrollers that
accompanied every demo. Now  though  people  put  much more effort into
greetings screen - Witness the  lovingly  hand  crafted 3D object logos
used in EKO-System.

Impulse have also gone  to  great  lengths  to  make  a great greetings
screen. "Into the blue" is  one  of  the  classic greets screens of our
generation.

The screen has a blue background,  it  is  obviously supposed to be the
sky. Across this fly various  crafts representing different crews. Each
crew has an individually painted logo which has some symbolism relevant
to that crew.  We  have  a  Coke  can  for  Dead  Hacker's Society (see
"Demolition"), an air ballon  for  EKO  and  even  a  little dog on the
Reservoir Gods logo. Cool. And the gang.

After this breath of fresh air  we  are  presented with an old screen -
the fractals screen from the  original  BFOS.  A rendered sphere with a
mandlebrot on  it  hardware  scrolls  onto  the  screen.  A sierspirski
fractal appears over this. We then have  a very small realtime Julia. I
think we have  to  come  to  the  conclusion  that  whilst fractals are
mathematically  interesting,  they  are  less  than  exciting  as  demo
screens.

The demo concludes with a line vector  object that leaves a trail as it
moves.

A sample of  Robert  Miles'  "Children"  accompanies  the  end  of demo
credits. A picture of each screen  is  displayed with the credits being
printed underneath. This is a lot better than the now cliched scrolling
text which seems to end every other demo we see.

The demo ends with the music  fading  out  smoothly and you are dropped
back to the desktop in the right resolution! Astounding!

"Bugs From Outer Space" is not an  earth shattering demo. It presents a
lot of effects that we have seen  before.  However it is a massive leap
forward from the original Fried Bits release.  It is good to see a demo
crew with a sense  of  humour  and  also  some  originality. The greets
screen is especially good.

BFOS shows that Impulse are a crew  with  a lot of potential, and their
next demo should really be something  special.  Before that we have the
very promising game "Corsair" to look forward to.

Bugs From Outer Space? It's tre-moon-dous! Simply Mars-vellous!
