Hi,
I  caught  this  on  Oxo Concept's web site  yesterday.  Since  it  may 
interest WWW-deprived fellow Atarians, I thought I'd pass it along. The 
web site also shows a screenshot of the thing.

Webspace  is a HTML browser,  so it permits the consultation of the WWW 
internet servers.  It is compatible with the quasi-totality of the HTML 
3.2 specifications,  and also with the Netscape (registered trade mark) 
extensions.   Its  100%  GEM interface is very intuitive.  The usage of 
indexed  dialog forms is an innovation (see the  screenshot).  Webspace 
integrates  a file manager dedicated to the managing of  the  consulted 
pages, the bookmark and the HTML cache.

Webspace manages a HTML pages and pictures disk cache.  Thus the access 
to  the  pages may be 10 times faster.  Furthermore,  the cache storage 
respects  the  original  name and structuration of  the  files,  It  is 
possible   to  consult  HTML  pages  after  disconnection.   The  cache 
automatically  manages the equivalence between the UNIX long names  and 
the 8.3 Atari format.

Webspace permits two types of software extensions: the services and the 
modules.  The  services  are non-HTML extensions:  newsgroups,  e-mail, 
ftp...  Les  modules  are programs witch manages HTML code.  It already 
exists  a  disk directory module (the C source code of this  module  is 
furnished  as  example)  and hypertext database  modules.  The  modules 
developer  documentation is furnished.  This modular system permits  to 
test cgi-bin programs prior to compile them on a big HTML server.

Webspace is compatible with all machines,  it works in 2,  16,  256 and 
TRUE COLOR,  from 320 per 200 points. The JPEG unpacking takes usage of 
the  DSP present.  It works with at least 1 Mb of RAM.  The recommended 
configuration is 4 Mb and a hard disk (a free space of 10 Mb to 100  Mb 
permits a good usage of the cache).
