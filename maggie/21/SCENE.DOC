                              NEWS ROUNDUP: more  soggy scrapings from 
                               the bottom of the computer-world barrel, 
                               dusted off with a dirty handkerchief and 
                               rinsed under the  cold  tap  for several 
                               hours.
                              CHIEF SCRUBBER: tat

                   [] ARIANE BLAMES COMPUTERS AGAIN

The European (not French, it's only French if it works) Space Agency's  
 Ariane 5  "explosion"  debacle  has  been  blamed  on  faulty computer  
 software. Analysis of rocket  wreckage  points to navigation software,  
 "hacked" from  its  predecessor  the  Ariane  4,  being insufficiently  
 tested on the new rocket configurations -  so in fact it's yet another  
 case of Programmer Error rather than Computer Error. Mind you, running  
 it  on  a  Pentium  90   didn't   help:   all  those  tricky  division  
 instructions...


                             [] BIG BLUES

Apparently an Olympics  took  place  in  America  sometime  this July.  
 (can't say I noticed, did you?)  Even  despite this low-key event, the  
 woes of IBM continue. Having decided to be the only corporation in the  
 US not needing to make any profit from the billions floating around in  
 Atlanta this summer, funds in the region of $60million are rumoured to  
 have been invested by the faceless Big Blue Brothers, in order to make  
 the Atlanta sports-fest the "most technological in history". Plans for  
 installing sophisticated networking  functions,  vast sports databases  
 and Internet linkup were unveiled, but as any computer enthusiast will  
 have guessed, it was more a case of Imbecilic Buffoon Machines.

At the time of writing the Olympics are  only 3 days old [later note -  
 this was pre-bomb news], but the funnier catastrophes include:-

             ù Numerous system failures during events (mostly caused 
             by "weather conditions being too hot") and huge flaws in 
             the results services and database management.

             ù A Tanzanian light-welterweight boxer who, according to 
             IBM, topped a fearsome 6.35m (20ft) in the ring, while a 
             Malaysian could onyl manage a paltry 2ft (60cm)...
             
             ù A fencer who  apparently  won  the  400m in a previous 
             Olympics...
             
             ù Hungary beat Spain in the fencing semifinals. Both had 
             been eliminated in the previous round, unfortunately.
             
             ù Cycling track records being  credited to an Australian 
             and a Dane - a full day before the event started?
             
             ù Results updating, linked to  the Olympics Website, was 
             notoriously slow, the shooting events requiring a person 
             to run several miles  to  the  computer centre to update 
             the results. Reports blaming 640K memory limits have yet 
             to be confirmed.

Media reaction to IBM's torch-fumbling  has  been bafflement and anger 
 to say the least. "I  get  a  better  results service from high school 
 track meets in Texas," wrote The  Dallas  Morning  News' Bob Yates - a 
 high school is presumably where all  IBM's resources have been placed. 
 "Info '96?  More  like  Info  1896....  pathetic"  said  a disgruntled 
 Australian journalist. IBM spokesmen  were  forced  to field questions 
 about how they failed to deliver what they so confidently promised.

Even a  local  talk  show  host  defending  Atlanta's  performance  on  
 Britain's Radio 5 Live laid blame on  IBM. "You always run into little  
 difficulties, that's par for the  course."  Most important for him was  
 that "The taxpayers won't  have  to  pay  for it. Corporate America...  
 paid for these Olympic Games, and  if  they made a mistake, we'll have  
 to forgive them for helping to build  the Games." So to hell with good  
 service, it was cheap.

Meanwhile TV addicts, or unemployed people  with nothing better to do,  
 will have spotted the IBM  advertising  campaign featuring the dubious  
 talents of spoof "Rock Gods",  Spinal  Tap.  Cynics will also be aware  
 that STap and IBM now share  more  than  one common trait: (a) they're  
 both just One Big Joke and (b) once exposed to them for more than half  
 an hour, the joke wears very thin.

                      [] CREAM TAO KIT UP AGAIN

Tao, member  of  Cream  best  known  for  his  fantastic  ST soundchip  
 efforts, has reverted to the ST with  a  vengeance - this time an STe.  
 According to fellow Creamster Agent -t-,  as well as beavering away on  
 DMA-played music,  Tao  has  developed  a  new  software  C64 SID-chip  
 emulator, which can run the original  C64  music  player code to a 90%  
 accuracy [now released, see the review  -  update Ed]. More details to  
 follow as we get it... no  doubt  a  certain  Mug  UK will be after it  
 though?


         [] IGLOO GIVE FALCON COLD SHOULDER - PC ESKIMO HELL

Igloo, the French  demo  crew  partly  responsible  for  the excellent  
 coding but meagre design of  the  "Geranium"  demo on the Falcon, have  
 moved to  the  PC,  released  a  neat  demo  ("Flirt")  then  promptly  
 dissolved to become members of  French  super-group Complex. Friend of  
 the Maggie editorship Flanker, creator of some of the loveliest rabbit  
 demo pictures ever, is however  still  active  on  the Falcon. So more  
 bunnies to come still!  See  the  'Entracte'  intro  (reviewed in this  
 issue) for the latest examples of his work.


                      [] RE-FRIED BITS TO SAVOUR

It seems that  the  Fried  Bits  IV,  after  a  year's  sabbatical and  
 replacement by the Symposium '96,  is  to  return next year in Bremen,  
 Germany, with  the  original  organisers  (Aura  and  Absence).  Those  
 present at S96 were mostly  in  agreement  that  the lack of space and  
 atmosphere let a good party down last  year, so they're hoping to make  
 next year's event  somthing  special.  There  are  already  some crews  
 looking to release demos next Easter.



                       [] AVENA WONDERFUL TIME

German and British doublescan demomeisters  Avena are still working on  
 a new demo. Entitled 'Sonolumineszenz'  it will feature original music  
 by Tommy, graphics by  Agent  -t  and  McFly,  and  the  usual host of  
 impressive effects by Tat, Jet and Thyroxin, stunning presentation and  
 blocky pixels. Or at least  that's  what  they  promise. Let's hope it  
 actually works this time... 


                         [] GIGAFUN A FUN GIG

This year's Gigafun coding convention in France took place this summer 
 with groups from  France  and  Germany  in  attendance.  The main demo 
 competition was won by Absence's Falcon demo, which has been held back 
 from release to add more design  elements, while ExA pipped Therapy to 
 the winner's post in the 96K competition (both are reviewed elsewhere) 
 Meanwhile the graphics compo was won  by the inimitable Flan from Exa. 
 This time without a picture of a rabbit.
