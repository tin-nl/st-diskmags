                            SMURF PREVIEW

If you read the  Symposium  party  report  you  will have noticed that
Germany crew Therapy were busy working  on a very interesting graphics
program for the Falcon030. This has the  title "Smurf" and seems to be
a very powerful tool.

Maggie has received an  exclusive  press  release  about this exciting
product from Dodger of Therapy:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you're right, we're working on  a graphics converter called SMURF
- silly name for a piece of  software  don't you think? It will be the
firstproject of our software label 'Therapy Seriouz Software'.

But meanwhile it is no more only a converter, it also grew to an image
processing program - i just  don't  know  where  the feature list will
end...

Here is some detailed information:

I have to make one correction to the Symposium-Article in Maggie 20 -
we support - at the moment  -  86  file formats (not 160...), the full
version will support about 130 formats  in import and export with full
support of the capabilities of each format (we can even read and write
compressed, monochrome Targa images...).

All importers, exporters and  image  processing functions are external
modules, so easy updating is guaranteed.

We now have 25 edit-modules - simple ones, such as invert, grayscale,
brightness/contrast, twirl,  and  more  complex  ones,  like  the bump
mapper (produces bump mapped images, with free chooseable lightsource,
colour and texture, from any image) or the stereomodule which produces
'magic eye' stereo-images from grayscale-depth-images.

Further edit-modules planned are:
-OCR - a full optical character recognition
-a 3D-Object modeller
-a renderer for the objects done with it

3D-support will probably be not  in  the  first  Smurf version, but we
will do it.

The whole thing is pretty  fast,  resulting  from the extensive use of
assembly  programming  in  most  processor-time-eating-functions  like
dithering, etc.

Some examples:

Load an 8-Bit GIF-Image, 1024*768 Pixels and dither Floyd-Steinberg to
16 Colors:
 Smurf    vs.   GEMView    Papillon
  26s            2:45        3:40
  100%           942%        1307%

Load the same picture as a Targa and dither FS to 16 Cols:
 Smurf   vs.    GEMView
  17s            2:26
  100%           1329%

Load True-Color TGA (1,0 Mbyte;  768x480),  decompress, Median Cut and
FS-Dither
to 16 Colors:
 Smurf    vs.   GEMView
  17.49           3:11
  100%            1829%

640*421 TC-TIFF horizontal mirror
 Smurf    vs.     DA's Picture
  2.2s             14s
  100%             636%

Invert 640*421 TC-TIFF
 Smurf    vs.      DA's Picture     Photoshop PPC
  1.5s                5.3s             1.3s
  100%                353%              86%

1024*768 GIF: 4X4 Mosaic-effect
 Smurf    vs.     Photoshop PPC
  1.0s               3.8s
  100%               380%

Smooth 320*200-TC-image with 3*3-matrix:
 Smurf   vs.      DA's Picture
  4.2s               16.0s
  100%                380%

The tests with Photoshop were done on  a 66MHz Power PC, 16MB RAM, 1GB
Harddisk with the PPC-native Photoshop-version...
And the edit-modules are not fully optimised (C-code only...)

There will be a lot of useful functions e.g:

-load or convert a whole folder of images into an animation

-convert all TC-xxx-images from a certain folder into
 8Bit yyy file-format AND all zzz-images to vvv... and so on

All edit-modules can be used on single images AND animations without a
special preparation of the module itself  for that. Anyone with just a
little experience in coding will be able  to program his own modules -
import, export or edit - very easy.  Most  of the modules did take not
longer than 2 hours  to  complete.  That's  because  Smurf does almost
anything concerning GEM and  window  management.  The modules can open
windows and tell smurf  to  put  their  own  GEM-Resource into it. All
window-handling, including Redraw, is done  by  Smurf, then. There are
certain functions of the main program wich  can be used by the modules
for easy realization of e.g. sliders, list fields, Pop-ups, etc.

Up to 20 modules can run simultaneously.

The whole program is  fully  GEM-compatible  and  runs  under any TOS-
compatible OS. There will be a special 030 / FPU - version for maximum
performance.

We will soon release a second  preview version (the first was released
in may and was really  shit  -  buggy,  not  running  on ST or MagiC -
sorry) which will run on all  TOS-OS, all Atari-machines (well, except
800XL, 300XE, Portfolio and the  typewriters)  with graphics cards and
accellerator cards without problems.


The full version will be  released  by  the  end of September 1996 (at
least I hope so) as  a  commercial  product  for  70 - 90DM (we're not
really sure about the price yet).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This sounds like  an  excellent  program  and  we  are  really looking
forward to it. Hopefully we will receive a preview version for further
inspection in time for Maggie 21.
