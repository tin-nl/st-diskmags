               MEETING OF THE WESSEX ATARI GROUP

The Wessex Atari Group, commonly known as WAG (or WAGgers, as Roy 
Goring might say) are a new Atari user group that is based in the 
south  of England.   Meeting up every six weeks or  so,  the  WAG 
group was formed by Roy,  Chris Good and Colin Fisher-McAllum one 
evening  in late May,  with the first meeting being  attended  by 
eight people in early June.

However, the meeting on the 26th of July was the second one to be 
held,  so,  after much thought, Chris and I decided to go down to 
it.   We also combined this journey with a visit to Mike  Noyce's 
place at Chichester, but more of that later ...

On  meeting CiH at his place in Rushden at approximately 2.30  pm 
that  afternoon,  we made our way down to the  nicely-kept  small 
town  (or  village  as Col likes to call  it)  of  Whitchurch  in 
Hampshire.

The  journey went OK,  with a slight hold up on the A34 near  the 
infamous route through Newbury,  where,  as those of us in the UK 
will  know,   is  the  place  occupied  by  so-called  'New   Age 
Travellers'  protesting about the bypass that needs to  be  built 
there.   Newbury itself was also a pain in the bum to get through 
..  now I have driven through there myself I know whose side I am 
on !!   We also learnt that poor Si Gardner has to drive  through 
there on his way to work each weekday, it must be hell !!

We  got down to Whitchurch just after 5.30  pm,  after  initially 
having  to  ask  for directions we found our way  to  Col's  pad.  
Together  with  Colin were Si Gardner and Simon  Coward,  who  we 
hadn't met before,  so greetings were exchanged etc.   Once  we'd 
been fed and watered and had had a fair bit of a chat, we decided 
to make the short walk (or drive, in my case, as I had my Falcon
with  me) over to the fire station in Whitchurch,  where the  WAG 
meeting was to be held.

At the meeting,  we met up with the now infamous figure described 
in a previous Atari show review as being 'shifty-looking',  known 
as  Chris  Good.   He had his Falcon setup in one corner  of  the 
room, together with the other setups owned by Roy, Mick Lock, and 
an 8-bit 130XE-based system on which the meeting's  demonstration 
was based.  Chris and Si gave me a hand to get my gear in, and we 
got Expose set up, together with my video camera on the new stand 
I had purchased some time before.

Mick  had  taken the post of WAGmaster when the group  was  first 
organised,  so together with Roy he welcomed everyone  officially 
to  the  meeting.   Various topics were discussed  including  the 
forthcoming shows then in eight weeks time and how WAG as a group 
was  going to prepare for them.   Following on from  this,  Chris 
Good had a great idea for a 'virtual web' site on his Falcon .... 
more on this was shown at the next meeting.

Brendan O'Neil,  who had brought in his 8-bit system,  gave us  a 
good  demonstration of just how good his system is,  despite  the 
fact that it is now,  admittedly,  showing its age.   However,  a 
scene still seems to exist on the 8-bit Atari,  which was all the 
better really ...

Most  of  the rest of the WAG meeting was spent  talking  to  the 
members  (as  well as the people I've mentioned,  there  were  16 
people  there  in total) and seeing just what they did  on  their 
systems.   Most people there seemed to be getting good use out of 
the  new  Zip drives,  which can store up to 100MB  on  removable 
cartridges.   After a few very enjoyable hours,  the meeting came 
to a close.

Everyone  promptly moved on to Colin's pad after the end  of  the 
meeting and had drinks, together with some chips that some of the 
guys  had  bought whilst walking back from the  local  fish-shop.  
Late  into  the night,  Roy finally left taking  Chris  Good  and 
others with him,  leaving Colin,  Chris Holland,  Si Gardner  and 
myself at Col's house.   Si soon left as well,  along with  Simon 
Coward, who was also at the meeting.

All in all, it was very enjoyable.  Chris Holland and I went over 
to  see  Mike  Noyce  at his  house  in  Chichester  ...  another 
interesting experience.  Mike was pleased to see us and showed us 
the new PC he'd bought with his post-college loan from the bank.
On the Sunday,  we drove back,  tired but having had a whale of a 
time ..... hopefully we'll do it again soon.

Felice.
