                                EARTH

                           A DEMO BY GASTON

----------------------------------------------------------------------


To call Earth a demo  is  probably  overstretching  the word a bit. In
reality it is just a single screen,  but with a nice effect that would
grace any of the best Falcon demo.

Earth originates from France and involves a spherical effect, but this
is no "bound" demo.

After loading the demo a black  screen  appears with some grey text in
the system font displaying the credits. The effect was programmed by a
relatively unknown coder called "Gaston".  The  DSP tracker replay was
by the ever reliable  Nullos  of  DNT  crew  -  (the  same routine was
featured in "Tautology II" fact fans!).

The demo sits around for a while, apparently doing nothing, but I have
a strong suspicion that it  is  doing  some precalculating. Still this
doesn't take too long, and is not of  the  "bugger off for a couple of
hours and make a cup of tea" variety.

The music featured is by the legendary  Domm of Animal mine and I know
it has been used in another demo,  but  I can't remember which one off
the top of my head.

Now we are into the main effect.  It  is the earth rotating round on a
globe - yes a decent bit of sphere mapping. For an effect like this to
work properly you need a good  piece  of  graphics, and the piece used
here does the job nicely.

It also doesn't look like  it  has  simply  been pattern mapped onto a
round surface, the graphics appear to  bulge  in the middle making the
effect look realistic.

The whole thing reminds me a lot of  the old link screens the BBC used
to use between programmes. Older readers will remember!

After a while spinning about the Globe then starts to bounce about the
screen, changing the angle of rotation  as  it bounces off the corners
of the screen.

Overall "Earth" is nice little demo. It would be good to see the coder
"Gaston" having the confidence to tackle a full demo. Still whilst not
earth-shattering (ouch! -joke ed) it is  still a w-earth-y addition to
your demo collection.
