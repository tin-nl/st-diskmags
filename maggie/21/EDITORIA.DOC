                   Maggie 21, coming of age issue??

It's  amazing what a difference just a few days can make as to how  the 
Maggie editorial is going to turn out.. Take this week as an especially 
vivid case study..

Monday,  get  Tat's  contributions  including his rather  wonderful  ST 
intro,  and  optimism unpacks its suitcase in preparation for a lengthy 
stay in my sitting room..

Erm,  Tuesday, or was that Wednesday, suspected postal strike which was 
lurking  uneasily is confirmed for the weekend,  which sort of puts  an 
unwanted  tightness on receiving contributions by the post,  in time to 
make  the deadline of the Atari Shows..  In spite of earlier  warnings, 
some  people  have still not sent their disks at this time,  and  I  am 
getting  a  tad worried to say the least..  To well and truly  put  the 
mockers on proceedings, Leon receives the Hydroxid intro for the Falcon 
shell..  This is very much awaited,  but it has been buggered up in the 
postal system and does not work..

Optimism  checks out of my house,  and is hastily looking for a bed and 
breakfast place to stay at instead..

Thursday,  or  was  that Wednesday evening?  Panicky E-Mails fly off to 
France to call on Arto to send the intro by E-Mail..  Serious doubts as 
to  whether  Leon's disk,  which contains approximately a third of  the 
total  content of this issue of Maggie,  will get here much before next 
weekend in any case.. If the editorial had been written at that moment, 
it  would  have  been  one of  the  blackest,  and  certainly  nastiest 
productions  ever written in Maggie,  mainly consisting of  four-letter 
words aimed at the Post Office..

Thursday evening/Friday, however, as if by magic, the turbulent airs of 
uncertainty cleared away, the postal strike was lifted, apparently with 
the  government threatening the royal mail monopoly..  This is a first, 
and it hurts *a lot* to say this,  but "Thanks,  John Major,  you saved 
our bacon!" 

At the same time,  Arto intercepts our communication, and in a stunning 
display of efficiency,  has the intro ready to download, and Leon, even 
more  stunningly has it downloaded and sent to us with the rest of  the 
Maggie stuff..  Net result,  everything arrives on Friday, and one very 
happy Maggie editor is the end result..

Optimism,  not having had a lot of luck trying to find a cheap place to 
stay, comes back to see us again, hopefully to stick around this time..

Anyway,this  week  goes to show that being Maggie editor  is  not  just 
about wearily reformatting text files to 72 columns, and trying to work 
out  why  the hell Leon sometimes chooses to split  his  paragraphs  at 
random..  There  is quite a lot of blood,  sweat,  tears,  and possibly 
other bodily functions involved as well..

(If you can't take the heat, stop sitting on top of my power supply!)

(Rubs   hands   on  trousers  as  if  in  preparation   for   important 
announcement..)

Welcome  to issue twenty-one of Maggie,  it may be the first issue  for 
some of you, because we are counting on at least a few people seeing us 
for  the  first  time  at the Autumn Atari  Shows,  where  we  will  be 
launching this issue.. We will have our own stand, which may not be the 
biggest,  but  perhaps  the  noisiest!!  This is what a "quality"  disk 
magazine  looks like from your end,  we hope you enjoy the  experience, 
and want to come back for more..

Regular  readers will notice quite a few changes for this  issue..  The 
Falcon  shell  program has received a minor spring clean,  with  a  few 
changes  of a mainly 'behind the scenes' nature..  Those of you reading 
the ST version of Maggie will have no doubt noticed the major revamp of 
the  old Delta Force shell menu..  More specific details are  contained 
within the 'help' file,  with a few helpful functions that even we were 
only half aware of previously, re-emphasised and added to.. We have Tat 
to  thank  for this,  as the changes went quite a bit further  than  we 
originally  requested..  The original brief was merely for a change  to 
the  music  player to allow more varieties of chip music,  as Big  Alec 
tunes were beginning to lose their appeal with at least one person  (hi 
Tronic!) As you can see, Tat went a lot lot further!

We also have Tat to thank for the brilliant ST intro,  and when was the 
last time we had one of those? (About issue ten..) This intro will also 
work  on the Falcon,  and should work in theory on just about  anything 
with  a Fuji badge externally,  and a member of the Motorola 68K family 
ticking  away  inside..  Oh,  and  a megabyte of memory would  be  very 
desirable too!

Also thanks fly to Arto for the equally brilliant Falcon intro, and for 
his  extra determination in making sure we got the thing in  the  first 
place!

The  other  unexpected  development  this  time  is  the  rather  early 
appearance  of  Maggie 21,  as it was only decided at about  5-6  weeks 
before  the Atari Show that we would release a new issue  there..  From 
next  to  nothing,  we have managed to accumulate a  reasonable  issues 
worth of articles, if not quite on the scale of the Maggie 20 marathon, 
which had such epics as the Symposium report to recommend it.. A lot of 
hard  work on the part of many people made this possible,  and you  all 
know who you are, and your efforts are acknowledged elsewhere..

Elsewhere,  a lot of departures, as we won't see ST News, ST Format, or 
probably the DBA mag to any real extent anymore..  However, in spite of 
this  it has not been a melancholy time at all,  with new arrival Atari 
Computing,  the  further  growth of ST+ diskmag,  and a generally  busy 
scene  since Maggie 20 contrasting with the dead months  that  followed 
the release of issue 19.. We don't feel sad, in fact we feel like we're 
having a better time than ever.. Do we want it to stop? Do we heck!!

It's getting on for 2.00am now, I think it's time for bed as I've got a 
long  task  tomorrow  of getting this Maggie  primordial  soup  of  raw 
articles and source code organised into a hopefully coherent and  tasty 
dish..

See you all next time!!
