Symposium  winners  Therapy  have  just hit a  prolific  patch,  as  in 
addition  to  their  Symposium  demo and the  preview  of  their  Smurf 
graphics  converter,  we  now  get this little intro from  the  Gigafun 
competition,  making three products in all from the same group reviewed 
in this issue..

Like  their previous demo,  this does not start off promisingly,  as an 
attempt  to  run  it  in a casual screen  mode  makes  it  fall  over.. 
Remembering that Therapy like Truecolour instantly produces results.. A 
quick  changing text sequence gives way to a very 'designey' scale  and 
rotate,  albeit  one  with trailing shadows..  This is whisked off  the 
screen  before too long to hustle on to the main effect of  the  intro, 
some 3-D realtime bump mapping..

This can be described barely as a lightsource moving over a 3-D  relief 
metallic foil effect textured background,  the effect as though someone 
has  engraved some lettering into the tinfoil..  This looks quite good, 
and a prototype of better still to come on the Falcon..

Unfortunately,  that is it,  as the intro abruptly cuts off in mid-play 
and ends, leaving some question marks over Therapy's finishing that was 
apparent from their earlier demo..

Ratings..

Graphix:- 77% - Alright but not a lot..

Sonix:-  80%  -  Nice tune that is cut off as it  just  starts  to  get 
going..

Gee-Whiz:- 75% - One newish effect,  some good presentation, but rather 
short..

Overall:-  74%  - Could have been really good but  too  unpolished  and 
short..
