First Sight: RIPLEY
-------------------

Most Lynx boxes, as you can  now  see,  are  not much cop, but for the
Dracula box, it looks like  they  actually employed a talented artist.
It's only spoilt by a yellow  starry  thing,  telling you that this is
an: "Interactive Role-Play Thriller!" and  more importantly: "Age 14 -
up".  I have absolutely no  idea  why  there  is an age restriction on
this game, it is the first such  restriction  I've ever seen on a Lynx
game and unless you  are  prone  to  nightmares  of blood sucking bats
which turn into tall,  dark-haired  men  with  long, pointy teeth then
there is nothing worthy of mass parent hysteria here.  No, really.

     After the cart has  loaded,  the  intro  begins  with some spooky
music and a pair of foreboding  eyes,  frowning at you over the words:
Dracula the Undead.  Pressing  a  button  will make them  disintegrate
and you enter the main intro: a cosy but disquieting room, Bram stoker
sitting in a high backed chair,  drawn  up  to the flickering fire you
can't quite see, a book  open  on  his  lap  and  the night looming in
through the uncurtained window behind, lit  up by spasmodic flashes of
lightning, which reveal  a silhouetted tree  and splash the floor with
diamond panes of light.  The music  is  quiet and dark, just the right
tone for horror and the graphics  are  truly beautiful, done in shades
of sepia to give an atmospheric age-old quality,  the animation of the
pages turning over  and  Bram  himself,  completes  the picture.  It's
flawless.

     Bram Stoker tells you,  via  a  scroll-it-yourself  text box, the
situation in which,  you,  Jonathan  Harker,  a  young solicitor, find
yourself.  You've been sent  to  Transylvania  to  do  some work for a
Count Dracula etc. etc. (if you don't  know the story, read the book).
He ends his account by telling you that Jonathan feels strange, "it is
as if he is not in  complete  control  of his own actions".  With that
piece of wisdom, Bram disappears  (although  he  does  pop up, now and
then as the game progresses) and  a cockerel crows signifying morning.
The game begins.

     You control Jonathan's movements,  which  are restricted to left,
right, back or forward, thus  as  Jonathan  walks towards the front of
the screen, he is (yes) scaled  up, displaying (once again) the Lynx's
sprite scaling capabilities (is  there  any  game that doesn't?).   At
the bottom of the screen there  is  a  white bar, with text written on
it.  Pressing button B will enable you  to turn the bar, the left half
of which has words such as:  Look,  Talk  to, Examine, Turn and Climb,
written on it.  The right half of this bar is reserved for storing any
objects you might find, so if you  find  a key and want to examine it,
you would select 'Examine' on the  left  half  of the bar and 'Key' on
the right half.  Simple really.  There  are nine possible commands you
can use to manipulate Jonathan's actions, a reasonably adequate amount
for a graphical adventure.

     You start in the antechamber, next  to your bedroom, in Dracula's
castle.  In the room is some old  furniture: a chest of drawers, a jug
and basin and a cupboard which can  be opened and creaks quite nicely,
as do some of the doors.  There has obviously been a lot of time spent
on creating the atmosphere of this game, the furniture is all antique,
your clothes look nineteenth century  at  least.  But the descriptions
of objects are a bit uninspired,  or minimalist at least, on examining
the cupboard you are told: "It's  an  old cupboard", 'Wow,' you think,
'I really needed to  know  that'.   But  most  of  the time, examining
anything will result in: "Nothing  interesting  about  it".  I think a
couple of well chosen words about all the recognised objects, (because
it doesn't recognise  every  piece  of  graphics)  wouldn't  have gone
amiss.

     Once you have mastered opening doors,  you are free to wonder the
castle, well maybe not quite free  since  most of the doors are locked
or just background graphics (boo, hissss).  But talking  of  graphics,
they are really very subtle and  atmospheric,  like the intro, done in
shades of sepia and brown, all very nice, especially the close up ones
of the count himself which you are  treated  to  as you have a chat to
him.

     Conversing with the dark devil is  achieved  by means of 'Talk to
Dracula', followed by choosing  one  of  the  three  or  so choices of
sentences, such as: "You have a very impressive home Count", oh creep,
creep, he's really going to spare your  blood now that you've said his
mouldy old castle is 'impressive', isn't he.

     The game follows its precedents; you  find objects which help you
to solve problems, such as unlocking doors  and so forth.  So there is
nothing new in that department.   It  also  has the old text adventure
favourite of a 'looping maze' section  to  the  game, in this case, in
Dracula's underground vault.  Each screen  of graphics looks identical
to the next, so if you walk  off  the  left of the screen, there is no
guarantee that is actually   the   direction   in  which  the coder is
sending you.  Hours (literally) of walking round and round and getting
nowhere can be very frustration.  And as well as this, it has the Bill
& Ted favourite of having  to  find  the  right  'path', in this case,
across a vertical castle wall.  Okay, original, but hardly riveting.

     However, the main flaw in this  game  is  its size.  It is really
way too small.  I would guess,  excluding  the maze section, there are
some ten rooms in all, which  is  not really acceptable when you think
of the  hundreds  of  locations  in  games  like  Monkey  Islands.   I
completed it very  soon  after  getting  it  and  really,  since then,
haven't been inclined to play it  again,  the  whole point of the game
being trying to  solve  puzzles,  which  aren't  really  puzzles after
you've solved them once.

     To conclude, the music, and to a greater extent, the graphics are
beautiful, well designed,  atmospheric..  the  occasional surfacing of
Bram Stoker with  his  eloquent  comments  narrating  your story, adds
depth and mystery.  The  animation  and  sprite scaling is impressive,
but this game falls down,  not  necessarily  on gameplay (although the
looping maze doesn't help), but more on game-length.  Perhaps the maze
was included in an effort  to  convince  people  the game is infinite,
undead even, when the reality  is  somewhat  more down to earth (like,
buried ten feet under).


Second Sight: Mr. Pink
----------------------

     This is a bit of a novelty, a graphical adventure on the Lynx! It
really does look stunning -  the presentation is faultless. Everything
is in loving shades of sepia,  giving  the  whole  game the feel of an
early hammer horror  movie.  You  half  expect  Christopher  Lee to be
playing the leading role.

     At first the game reminded me a bit  of cruise for a corpse - the
way the main character scales out  as  he moves depth-wise through the
room. There are not many keywords to  choose  from, and it will in the
main only let you try valid actions.

     When you get something right, the  game cuts back to the narrator
sitting in his chair turning pages of the novel. This is a nice touch,
and a good plot device.

     The main  problem  with  this  game  is  that  there  aren't many
locations. There are 8 different rooms,  plus the maze and the outside
walls. This isn't really enough.

     The puzzles are very simple too. Half  the time the item you need
to complete a puzzle is in the  same  room. There are so few items and
puzzles that it doesn't take long to work out what does what.

     Since starting this article I  played  the  game properly for the
first time. One hour and a half  later  (with much help from Ripley) I
have completed the game. This isn't really lasting appeal.

     I guess that the  main  problem  the  coders  had  was that there
wasn't enough  memory on  the  cart  to  fit  more  graphics for extra
locations.

     So there we have it:  Dracula:  The  Undead. It looks lovely, and
will provide a distraction for an hour or so, but can't really stake a
claim at having long term playability.  This isn't a reflection on the
brilliant graphics, but the appeal will have vanished by dawn.

The Verdict:             Dracula The Undead
