                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well,   it's  been  a pretty depressing last six months on  the  Atari  
Scene   hasn't   it?...   A short time ago,   we had two major  glossy 
Atari   magazines,   Atari   World  and ST Format.   First went  Atari 
World,   a  very  well  respected  publication,   a sad loss for Atari 
users  indeed.    Then came rumours of  the  possible  demise  of   ST 
Format,   which again  unfortunately  proved  to  be  correct. Another 
sad loss, despite the fact that toward the end the magazine  resembled 
a pamphlet more that a magazine.  

So  now  what happens?...   Once upon a time we had loads of  mags  to 
read,   now  we  are left with none....   or are we?...   Where are us 
Atari  users  to  gain  valuable  information about new  products  and 
services now?...                             

                         --------------------

The  answer is,   a lot of places,   firstly in the form of magazines.   
Now  I  know what you are thinking,  you're thinking "Hang on,  didn't 
he say  there  were  no  Atari magazines?",   well yes I did,   or did 
I,   I  was  of  course  actually refering to glossy magazines.    But 
there  is still another magazine  which is apparently thriving on  the 
atari scene,   that of the FaST Club's ST  Applications,   although  I  
have never actually seen this  magazine,   it  is  apparently  a  very 
much  respected publication which caters  for  all  atari  users,  and 
features the  latest news,  and  reviews of the latest   products. The 
magazine  has been running now for some considerable time,   but it is 
not   available in the shops,   for more information you can call  the 
FaST club  on  0115-945-5250.

Another  piece of good news is the recent announcement of a brand  new  
Atari  magazine that will be released at the forthcoming Atari  shows.  
Put together  by Mike Kerslake,   Frank Charlton and Joe Connor,   the 
new  magazine  is to be  called  Atari   Computing.    Many  respected 
Atari  writers  have  shown  their  support for the new venture,   and 
our  beloved  Maggie has even gotten in  the   act.    Apparently  the 
first  issue will feature 60 A4 pages,   promising up to  date reviews 
of the latest commercial and PD/shareware products.

As   with ST Applications,   Atari Computing won't be available in the  
shops,   this  is  to  avoid the problems associated  with  the  other 
magazines,   and  help   keep costs down.    There are several ways to 
subscribe  (which will more than  likely have been covered more  fully 
elsewhere  in this issue of Maggie).   But  for  more  information you 
can  contact Mike Kerslake at Atari  Computing  by  either writing  to 
him at...

                         -----------------------
Next  off,   we  have  the  disk-magazines,   a  medium  of  obtaining 
information  that   I'm   sure you're all aware of (or  at  least  you 
should be if  you're  reading  this <g> ).  

Diskmagazines  have  been  around since the very early  days  of   the  
Atari  computers,   some (like Maggie) have been going for a very long 
time.   Whilst  the  magazines may be very good for reporting news and 
information  from   the  commercial side of the  Atari  world,   disk-
magazines  have  for  some time  been   keeping   users   informed  of 
developments in the P.D  and  shareware  market.   Another  difference 
with  disk-magazines  is  the fact that they are  much   more   reader 
interactive,   most of them specifically request contributions in  the  
form  of  articles  from the readership.  

Maggie.. well what can I say about Maggie, it's been going for about 5 
years   now   if  I can remember correctly,   has changed hands a  few  
times,  but  is  definitely one of the best.  As you can probably see,  
each  issue is usually  packed to the brim with information,  not just 
Atari  related.   In  fact Maggie  is a very diverse  diskmag,   which 
covers  a range of subjects.   The fact that  Chris allows some of  my 
missives  into the mag may put a small question  mark  on  his  sanity 
though ;-). (JUST A SMALL QUESTION MARK?? - ED)  To get hold of a copy 
of  Maggie   simply...   hang  on,  if you're reading this you already 
know  where  to  get it etc..  so what am  I on about...  20 issues  + 
specials produced to date...
 
AtariPhile..   a   relatively new diskmagazine to hit the Atari scene,  
but   a   very impressive one at that.    This one is put together  in 
HTML  format,   and  therefore you need the web  browser CAB 1.3 +  to 
view  it.   Atariphile   is  a  sort of off-shoot of the  Falcon  Fact 
File,   but  much of the content is aimed  at the general Atari  user.   
In the main,  Atariphile is aimed at the serious  Atari user,   and as 
with  many  of  the  others features news,   reviews  etc..   a   very  
polished zine,  which will inform and entertain.   For a copy  of  the  
latest issue,   send a formatted double density disk and 2 first class 
stamps  to: 
                           Colin Fisher McAllum 
                             11 Pound Meadow 
                                Whitchurch 
                                  Hants 
                                 RG28 7LG

Alternatively,   copies can be found on most Atari supporting bulletin  
board  systems such as:                         

          All   At   Sea  BBS   01203   601448                          
          42   BBS        01256 895106

              2  maybe  3 issues produced to  date..

Stosser  diskzine...  This is a diskmagazine dedicated to users of the  
STOS   programming   language  on the Atari ST.    Does contain   some  
general   Atari  articles  and other more general stuff.    Each  disk 
usually has a  different  shell,   which  tends  to  play  up  on  TOS  
versions   of   2.06  and  above  unfortunately,   this  can be  fixed 
with  the  STOS fixer,   but because of  the  packer used on the  text 
files, Falcon owners will have problems.  Latest issues of Stosser can 
be obtained by sending a disk and stamp to:

Deano        27 Turbary Walk Milnrow                                  
                 Rochdale OL16 4JN

27 issues + special produced to date.
 

ST+.....   ST+  is  a monthly diskmagazine which although less than  a 
year  old,   is  fast  gaining a great deal of respect  in  the  Atari 
community.   Rightly   so   in my opinion.   So far 8 issues have been 
released,  and  it has improved with  each issue.   The shell works on 
all  Atari machines which is a bonus,  and the  content is similar  in 
that  they  are relevant to all Atari users,   there  are  other  more 
general sections too.  

If you would like a copy, send disk and stamp to:
                           Dave 'Yahoo' Hollis 
                            43 Spenfield Court 
                                  Lings  
                               Northampton 
                                 NN3 8LZ

8, possibly 9 issues to date.
This   is  just a small example of the wide  selection  of   disk-mags  
available  for the Atari machines.   Others include Warp,  ST Highway,  
Kelstar,  Third  Dimension and many others..

                              --------------

Next off,   user groups, they seem to be popping up all over the place 
at the  moment.   Most of them hold regular meetings at which problems 
can   be   solved   by  other  users,    new  programs   demonstrated,  
P.D/shareware  swapped and  much  more.     Two of the latest clubs to 
form  are  WAG  and CORK.   WAG is for Atari  users in  the  south  of 
England,  they  hold  regular  meetings,  and I believe are   in   the  
process  of creating a newsletter.    CORK is aimed at users  in   the  
Coventry   area in the centre of England.    You can contact the clubs 
on  the  following numbers.

                      WAG: Roy Goring : 01705 611847
                    CORK: Antony Lacey : 01203 601443

There  is  also a list of current user groups which is maintained   by  
Harry  Sideras of the UK Association of Atari User Groups.

                        -------------------------

For   modem owners,   there are many bulletin boards up and down   the  
country   that   are  still supporting the Atari ST.    This  includes 
message   areas  in  which  you can chat about every aspect  of  Atari 
computing  you  can think  of.    A lot of these bulletin  boards  are 
linked together via vast networks,  which  means that not only can you 
communicate  with users of the same bbs,   but you  can  also keep  in 
touch  with  others  all  over  the  world.     A  lot  of  news   and  
information   is  spread this way,   far quicker than any paper  based  
magazine  could possibly report it.

There   is  also the fact that a substantially large amount  of  Atari  
programs  and files are available from the boards... in most cases all 
you  have  to pay  for  is  the  cost  of your phone  call,   although  
sometimes   there   may  be  subscription fees charged for  access  to 
certain areas.  

Almost  all new  PD/shareware software is now released  onto  bulletin  
boards,   in   most   cases,   before  anywhere else.    The  following  
are  particularly  supportive of Atari machines:

                 All At Sea BBS : Coventry : 01203 601448 
                 The Tavern BBS : London : 0181 445 6514 
              Ad Lib BBS : Chester Le Street : 0191 370 2885  
                      42 BBS : Hants : 01256 895106 
                          --------------------- 

As  well as bulletin boards,  Atari users also have access to the vast 
network    that   is  the  Internet.     Due  to  software   such   as 
CAB/STIK/OASIS/ICE  etc...  it   is  now possible for Atari  users  to 
browse the web and much more.   There are  literally hundreds of Atari 
web  pages,   tons  of ftp sites where you can find  huge   lists   of  
atari files,  newsgroups where you  can  chat  about  Atari  machines.   
There  is also IRC where you can chat on-line to others by typing   it  
in  on your keyboard and recieving a reply almost immediately.    Plus  
of   course,   the  fact  that you can send and receive  Email,  (some 
Bulletin boards  even offer Email facilities for free as well!).

                            ------------------ 

All of the above is just a small snippet of the sort of activity  that  
there  is  on the Atari scene.    Whilst the major magazines may  have  
disappeared,   there  is  still  a  lot of life left in  us  all  yet.   
Certainly  the Atari shows  would appear to be a superb  demonstration 
of  that  fact.    I  hope this little  missive  has  given  you  some 
insight into just what there is out  there,  and  erm, keep it atari.
