R A D I C A L   R A C E   ( P R E V I E W )


          GAMES: Back in the very earliest days of the Falcon, a group 
           called Pentagon made some rather  impressive 3D demos. After 
           4 years, they're back with a neat little game preview...
          Super-Sprinter: Tat


This is another in-development title that  has been hanging around for 
 a while now, but as with  so  much  Falcon software, it looks like the 
 title itself has been  postponed  for another few weeks/months/decades 
 (or the programmers have decided  to  work  on their next title before 
 finishing the last one.) "Radical  Race  The  Preview" itself takes up 
 around 3 megabytes of diskspace, so you can at least see that a lot of 
 work has already gone into it - after all, it is French.

After finally getting it installed you  are presented with a series of 
 beautiful introductory pictures, and  then  a well-presented and well-
 drawn menu. Options are mostly disabled,  but  there is even an option 
 to customize the in-game screen area:  a nice touch, although by using 
 the Abstract/Fatal Design screen routines mean  that the whole game is 
 unuseable on a normal  television.  [Hackers'  hints: Change the lines 
 after "btst #7,$ffff8006.w" from "bne.s" to "beq.s" using MonST...]

Having chosen your game  type,  it's  on  to  the character selections 
 (more beautiful graphics) then the  track  to  drive on, which are all 
 basically the same with  different  graphics,  then, finally, the main 
 game itself.

Oh yes, the game! As usual, much of the gameplay is only half-finished 
 - intelligence routines and  gameplay  design  always  seems to be the 
 *last* thing that people put in a  game (shouldn't it be the other way 
 round?) As a result, it would  be  unfair  to  make any comment on the 
 game in detail. What we -can-  say  is  that the game is loosely based 
 around the SuperSprint / Badlands / Micro Machines style, racing round 
 the overhead views  of  hardware-scrolling  tracks,  while shooting at 
 other cars while they shoot at you. Splendid fun.

In-game graphics aren't as good as  the options screens, however in an 
 intelligent move, the programmers have not attempted to go for complex 
 presentation … la "Moonspeeder"  (incidentally  a very similar program 
 gameplay-wise), and  instead  have  a  smooth  50/60Hz  update,  which 
 enhances playability a lot. Sound is also very good with effective use 
 of samples in a cool French accent ("Wan!" "Tuuuu!" "Shreee!" "Go!").


There are of course a few bugs left in (particularly when the computer 
 decides you've won halfway through a  circuit?) but overall this shows 
 promise. Will is ever be released though? We hope it does, if only for 
 the ace visuals.
