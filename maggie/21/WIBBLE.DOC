                   Part 3 : The Return After the Return 
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Greetings  fellow Atarians (and any others who may be  visiting),   and 
welcome   to yet another one my inane ramblings.    Once again i'll  be 
delving  into  the  deepest  recesses of my mind for  anything  that  I 
might  find   interesting  to  talk about.    Rest assured,   if I find 
something  worth noting I'll ignore it  completely and just  talk  crap 
for a while..

Some of you may ask why I continue to type these missives for  Maggie?,  
the  answer to that is simple,  I haven't recieved a letter bomb in the 
mail  yet,   so   on I go....   having said that I'd probably never get 
them if  they  were  sent anyway ;-).
 
                            -----------------

What can I find to talk about first then?... hmm, it's been an eventful 
last   couple   of  months for me.    After 18 months of  waiting,   we  
were  finally  offered a new home by our housing association.  Actually 
18  months isn't bad  for  a housing association,   especially when you 
consider that  we've  moved  into  a  much  larger  place.   These  big 
houses  are  very  hard  to  find  apparently.   Anyway, within 3 weeks 
of our viewing the place we were in.  I  just  wish that the same could 
could  be  said  of the council..   Way  back  in   January   we   were 
offered  a council property "It'll be ready to  view  in  a  couple  of 
weeks",  they say "ring back then", so we do as they say and wait,  and 
get  the  same  answer again,   and again,   and again.   By now  we've 
started   noting  everything said in calls between us so that  we  have 
evidence   if  we  have to complain to the papers,  if you know what  I 
mean ;-).

Finally we get to last month,   July,  the house should be ready by the  
18th   they   say,   we'll   call....   On the 17th we get a call  from  
Orbit  housing,  offering us this place, we view and accept in one day.  
Next  day  the Council  ring  and  tell us that the  keys  are  finally 
ready  to view  the  place  they  offered,   after  6 months waiting it 
took a lot of work to  'politely'  tell  them to stuff off... 

A  few  weeks  later,   and  here I am,   no thanks  to  the  council's 
ineptness,   I   finally have a nice big house...  but here's the weird 
bit,  two  days  after we  move,  we get a call from my sis,  telling me 
that  she has moved,  to the house  we 'would' have been offered by the 
council,  and yet she was told she would  have  to wait 5 years because 
she was not in need...    Having now  seen  the  place,   I can see why 
she got it so soon,  it's a dump,  and I wish I had seen  it before she 
moved,  because I'd have tried desperately to talk her out  of  it.  

Why  is it that there is such a difference between  different  estates, 
the one  i'm living on now,   is well managed,  kept clean and tidy and 
all  that by  a  caretaker hired by the housing association.    The one 
my sister is living on  has broken glass, litter and scrap all over the 
place,  there  dosen't  seem to  be  anyone who looks after the  place.   
It's  also  a very dodgy area  indeed,   just hope the security on  the 
house is decent...    I don't think so  though,   because the amount of 
empty and boarded up places suggests otherwise...

On a happier note (about time they say),  I've been after this move for 
ages,   and  now  that its finally happened I'm really happy about  it.   
Of  course,  if   I've  moved,   this also means that Warp diskmag  has 
moved,   so  it  might  be  a  good idea to let everyone know  the  new 
address,   anyone  is  welcome  to write,   us Atarians have  to  stick 
together ;-).

Warp is now at issue 5 by the way,  and Falcon compatable at long last, 
so if  you want a copy of that write and let me know.  My Email address 
remains the  same at kdunn@allatsea.demon.co.uk

                            ----------------
 
If  you haven't heard from me in a while for whatever reason,   why not  
write   and  let me know how you're getting on,   I've already  noticed 
that  the   post  here is _much_ more reliable than it was at  the  old 
address,  comes nice and  early  in the morning as well,  which makes a 
nice change from 1 o'clock  in  the afternoon.  

So   what  was  the  move actually like?,   to be honest it was  a  bit  
of  a  nightmare,  not  something I would want to do again in a  hurry.   
All   that  rushing  around  etc...   Actually letting people know  has  
proved  the  most  difficult part,  it took absolutely ages to get hold 
of  people like  British  Gas took ages,   ever single line I rang  was 
engaged,   but  unlike  most  lines,   they had one of  those  flippin' 
answering  services which actually puts you on  hold until  someone  is 
available  to answer the call.   This wouldn't be so bad  if the number 
was  freephone,   but  because  it  isn't,   the second  the  phone  is  
answered  at their end you're going to be charged the minimum  BT  call  
charge   of 4.?p...   Then you hang on for a minute or two in the  vain 
hope  that   they  might actually answer your  call  sometime  soon....  
Every now and then yo get  a  recorded voice saying,   "Your call is in 
a  queue,   and  will  be  answered  shortly",   very annoying.    But a 
little  advice to those of you who get  the  same  problem,   make sure 
you make a complaint about it,   and emphasize  the  fact  that you are 
being charged for the calls.    This is what  I  did,   and  because of 
that I got a fiver knocked off my bill.   not a great deal I know,  but 
better  than  a kick in the teeth,   and a bit more than it cost me  to 
ring  them.

Another  problem  occured when I tried to inform the DSS of  my   move,  
they  informed me that I would have to change office,   and therefore I 
would  have  to  make a new claim.   This meant having to fill in forms 
and  pay   numerous   visits to the DSS offices at a time  when  I  was 
already  extremely busy trying  to  get the move sorted,   what  really 
annoys  me is the amount of  forms  you  have to fill in.    Why  can't 
this place be like other countries,   I've heard  in  Germany  you fill 
in one form,  and all your  benefit  entitlements  are  sorted out from 
that.    Here you have to chase everything up yourself,  find  out what 
you  may  be entitled to,  get the forms,  fill them in,  then wait flip  
knows how long whilst they sort it all out.

The house itself is pretty much sorted out now though,  there are still 
a few  big boxes of junk lying around,  and there are a couple of rooms 
to decorate,   but getting there slowly.   Although I've now got a list 
as long as your arm  of  stuff  that  the missus wants me to get   done  
to  the  place,   shelves,   cupboards  and stuff.   She's very good at 
giving  me  loads  of  jobs  to  do   is   Kerry,   just   because  I'm 
umemployed,   she  seems to think that I  should  be  spending  all  my 
time doing up the house.   Wouldn't be  so  bad,  but  I'm  terrible at 
decorating  and DIY and stuff,   anyone who's seen the efforts  at  our 
previous  house  would testify to that fact.   Talk about  co-incidence 
I've   just  been asked by her if I'll sort the garden  out  today,   I 
reckon  she  must  have  been  looking over my shoulder  or  something.   
Dosen't  look  like  I'm  going to get out of it either,   it's a  nice 
sunny  day out there,  so it looks  like my afternoon is going to be  a 
fun one :-(...
 
                          ----------------------
 
Hmm,   got  to  think  of something to whinge about again  now,   aha!, 
footy.   In  particular Coventry City.  I wish I had sent this file off 
to  Chris  earlier,   because by that time we'd only been beaten  once, 
quite  heavily  I must admit,   by Nottingham Forest,   but since I was 
sending this out over the next day or  two,  I thought I'd take a fresh 
look.    Things have not changed much  since  then as you will probably 
all know...   bottom of the table,  1 goal, 1 point.   Very  depressing 
indeed.    In the part of this file I orignally wrote I  had  put  some 
predicted  scores  for the next couple of matches,   needless  to   say  
they were hopelessly wrong,  and have therefore been hastily deleted in 
this   little   re-written  bit  ;-).    If I just say that I  had   us  
down  to  beat  Middlesborough,   I  think that about sums it up...  4-
0?....  what the  heck  happened?...  

Despite  the  bad results we've been having,   I still think we have  a  
team   capable  of Europe,   although there is definately a lot of work 
to  be  done.    We've  only scored once,   and conceded something like 
11,  not very good  at  all.

In  the  case of other clubs,   Man Utd and Newcastle don't seem to  be 
doing  as   well  as  they would like.    Although Man  Utd  are  still 
unbeaten,  they  haven't  looked  as good as last year yet,   and to be 
honest I don't think they  will  get  the title this year,   i'm hoping 
to  god this is true,   because  I  love  listening  to  Man  Utd  fans 
whinge when things don't  go  their  way  ;-).    Shearer  dosen't seem 
to  have  really settled in yet at Newcastle  either,   I   was  really 
chuffed when they got him,  because I didn't want him to go to Man  Utd 
;-).    But  so  far it looks like the only one who has benefited  from  
his  arrival is Les Ferdinand.

I   think the main difference so far has been the introduction of   all  
these   overseas  players,  and the amount of quality  British  players 
around... I have  a feeling, and a hope that this season the title will 
be a much more crowded  race than it has been for a while.

                            ----------------- 

The olympics........   don't know about you,  but it was the worst I've  
ever  seen,   I'm  not just talking about how badly a lot of the  Brits  
did,   that   would   just  be  sour  grapes (American).    But if  you  
were   watching  the  coverage,   it was always the American who was on 
screen  for  ages,   and I got  totally  fed  up of  seeing   Coca-Cola  
etc..   plastered  everywhere.    These  Olympics  were not about sport 
or  the  athletes,   it was about big  corporate  business,   money and 
American propaganda...   I swear if I had seen one  more  flippin stars 
and  stripes  I'd have screamed.    I'm hoping that when it   goes   to 
Sydney,  it  will  not have as much money or commercialism involved,  I 
doubt  it,   but  I  have  my fingers crossed.   The only  trouble  is,  
that   right   afterwards,   it   goes back to America  and  Salt  Lake 
City...   I  really   think  that the IOC has been bought off by  these 
huge multi-national  corporations.    how long before we have the Coca-
Cola Olympics?...

It's  not just me either,   that Sammeranch fellow didn't call  Atlanta  
"The  Greatest Games ever",   a big snub really,   and a true reflction 
of what many  in the world thought of the games.... 

The  only thing I want to know is,  what happened about that bombing in  
the   park?.    For a day or two,  the media was forever going on about 
the  security  guard who found the bomb being arrested for planting  it 
or something,   since  then,  nothing has been said,  as with all these 
'big'  news  stories,  it  just   died away,   will we ever  hear  what 
happened to him?,   was he  charged?,   why  doesn't anyone ever follow 
up on these stories?....

                           -------------------

Anyone  watch  the Star Trek night on BBC 2 the other  day?..  Opinions 
anyone?.   I thought it was a bit naff myself actually,  as always they 
managed  to  show  Star  Trek  fans as little geeks  who  have  nothing 
better  to  do  than  argue  about  Trek  and whether or not  such  and 
such  a  thing that was in  such  and  such an episode  would  ever  be 
scientifically possible...  

The   worst thing about the whole night though in my opinion  was   the  
timing   behind the showing of the voyager pilot  episode  "Caretaker".   
Now,  I'll be  the first to admit that it was great the BBC ever showed 
it  all,  and  it  will  probably be some time before the rest  of  the 
season gets shown...  but,  why  so late to show the episode?... surely 
it  would have made more sense to show  it earlier and thus generate  a 
little  more  interest in the series when it is  shown..  Instead  they 
decided to show the program at gone 11 o'clock,  the BBc  seem  to have 
their  priorities all a little mixed up.    I would  have  shown   that 
episode as the opener,  then everything else... Another complaint I had  
was with some of the people they had presenting,   firstly that ginger-
haired   bloke  who did the trailers.    Now I don't know about  anyone 
else,   but  if   I  had seen those,   I would have assumed he would be 
presenting  the special  or  would at least be involved in some  way...  
thankfully  he  wasn't,   but  if   he  had  been,   I   wouldn't  have 
watched,  simply because I think the guy  is  a  dickhead,  and I don't 
understand why he even got on telly..  I suspect it is  because  of his 
ginger  hair,   perhaps  the BBC are trying to groom their  own   Chris 
Evans... 

There  was  also that McGowan chap who presented  the  spoofs  section,  
took  up  far too much of the time alloted.   I would like to have seen 
more  spoofs,  as  there are definately loads about,   but I would have 
settled for someone that  was  vaguely  funny  presenting if they  were 
going  to wibble  on  for  ages.    Instead  the BBC chose someone  who 
wasn't in the slightest  bit  funny,  and  even annoyed the hell out of 
me...  What the hell was that Gazza  impression  doing in there?.. he's 
another dick if you ask me..

Ah   well,   at least they decided to have a Star Trek special at  all,  
which   surprised  me a little in itself...  It could have been  a  lot 
better,  and  with   the  cult  popularity the programme  has,   a  lot 
longer...   but,  at the end of  the day it could have been a heck of a 
lot worse.

                           -------------------

I   read  somewhere  yesterday that John Major has said there   is   to  
be   no   general election this year.   Some people seem  surprised  by 
that,  but not me.  They're waiting until next year because in the next 
budget they're going  to  cut a few taxes to butter up a few people,  I 
expect fags and booze will  go  up again though.  

The  thing that worries me most is that some people might actually fall  
for   this  tax cutting sweetener,   and actually vote the Tories  back  
into  power  again.    It seems that some people just do not learn from 
past mistakes, and  will just believe anything that the PM says.... 

According  to  the government,   the unemployment figures  continue  to  
fall,   I   honestly   don't  understand where they are  getting  their  
figures   from,   my   experience tells me that there are  more  people 
unemployed  now,   at  least  our  local job club seems to  be  getting 
busier  and  busier.    There also seems  to  be quite a few rounds  of 
major  redundancies  going around as well,   the  only  explanation   I  
can  come  up with is that they are shunting yet   more   people   onto  
courses and such like,   and are thus taking them off the  unemployment  
benefit figures...

                           --------------------

So the Royal divorce has finally gone through,   about flippin time,  I  
just   hope  that  this media coverage of the royals goes away  a   bit  
now,   simply   because I am fed up to the back teeth of hearing  about 
what  things are going  on  in the royal family.    I couldn't give two 
hoots  who's bonking  who,   or  what hospital has just been opened  by 
whoever.  I know they are our monarchy  and  all that,  but thats about 
all  they are,   in fact I think this  country  would  be a lot  better 
off  without  them.    Makes me sick to hear  about  how   much   money 
Diana has been given as a divorce settlement,   the royal  family  gets  
far  too  much money from the British people,   and  all  because  they  
happened  to be born into the family.    The media are always on  about 
the  fat  cats of the privatised industries,  well,  the royals are the 
biggest fat cats  of all. 

                           -------------------

Well,  that's this whinge and moan out of the way again
