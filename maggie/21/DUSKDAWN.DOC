                          by Kev "Taff" Davies

Quentin Tarantino  is  back  (Hurrah)  in  yet  another   testosterone
oozing, stomach churning, pumpin'  powerhouse of  a blood fest. That's
right it's your standard top  quality  Quenty  offering, and don't yah
just love 'em.

 The Plot  is  nothing  but  original,  combining  Bram  Stoker  with
Mr.White to produce Mr. Stoker or maybe Bram White<grin>.

 The Geko brothers Seth (George "My  turn  to be Batman" Clooney), and
younger brother Richard  (Quentin Tarantino)  are  on the run from the
cops, and desperate to get  to  the  safety  offered by Mexico. Pretty
standard plot-type-thing so far. The Gekos with hostages in tow arrive
at their rendezvous, the Titty  Twister (hmm),  a mexican strip joint.
The staff of which  start  turning  into  the baddest  vampires in all
Mexico. After the first drop of blood  hits  the floor all hell is let
loose (as is Quenty's  imagination)  and  vampires start getting offed
left, right, and centre.

 Scenes to especially watch out for are, Seth's pneumatic wooden stake
and the scene where Harvey Keitel  gets  half his head blown away. The
influences from other films  are  easily  spotted  some of the make-up
looks as if it has come  straight  from the "Nightbreed" stable, while
the bleeding hand seen  is  nicked  straight  from  "Near Dark", which
Quenty has admitted was an influence.

 This is such a truely great film  it  cannot be given justice by this
review. This film has everything, and  does  what it does superbly. It
is now firmly planted in my  top  ten  films  of all time. If your not
squeemish go see it. If you are, see it and don't sleep for a night or
two.

Psycho-chainsaw-eat-flaming-death-bloodfest rating: 4.9/5
