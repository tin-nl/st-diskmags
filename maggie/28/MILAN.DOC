                           by Kev Davies 

Hailed  as  the first third generation Atari compatible  platform,  the 
Milan  caused much excitement in the Atari camp.  Partially because  it 
was the first  new Atari based machine for quite some time,  but mostly 
because everyone in the know was waiting ( and waiting...) for Centek's 
Falcon  clone.  Milan  however beat Centek to the punch and produced  a 
machine that not only held its own in the specs.  department,  but also 
looked incredibly sleek when purchased fully assembled. 

In  fact,   most initially raved over the looks of the machine than the 
actual performance.  In any other industry this is commonplace, however 
up until recently it was unheard of for an Atari compatible  production 
model  to  look  good (we all remember the  hype  about  the  prototype 
Falcons  being housed in PC style desktops!) When the  Falcons  finally 
made it into production we were left with the grey doorstop). But looks 
aside, is the Milan any good?

After  much messing about I finally got hold of  a pre-assembled  Milan 
(a  self-assembly  kit is also available,  but as I did not get one  of 
these  I cannot possibly comment on them and can only point you in  the 
direction  of Atari Computing Issue 11 and Joe Connor's review (He's  a 
braver man than I)).

So to the hardware....

The  Milan  sports a Motorola MC 68040 which I have to  admit  looks  a 
little  disappointing on paper as in todays market place the 060  would 
have  looked  a lot better,  at least on paper,  and may have given the 
Medusa machines a run for their money. The operating system does run at 
a  lightning pace and the screen updates make you wonder why  you  ever 
had  to  part with cash for a screen accelerator in the past.  We  will 
examine the OS later.

As 'external' available ports go,  we are almost spoilt for choice with 
 an  unprecedented three COM ports,  as well as the more usual  parallel 
printer  ports,  PC  keyboard,  and mouse ports.  However the absence of 
standard  MIDI  and sound terminals (available on card) and  SCSI  port 
(also  available on card)  could be considered a glaring omission,  but 
as  they  are  available  as the proverbial  optional  extras  I'm  not 
inclined to quibble. As 'internal' connectors are concerned, oh boy, we 
have:

(deep inhale)

3x ISA slots 
4x PCI-slots 
4x EDO-RAM slots  (huge memory upgrades possible.... now  
                        where are those SIMMS :>  ) 
2x IDE ports (Primary and secondary)

(Gasp!)

The  Milan does score points for architecture using PC  standard  slots 
allowing  for easy hardware development.  The motherboard is incredibly 
neat  and appears to be  of the highest build quality.  It does however 
seem a little sparse, but do not be fooled, the hardware that is on the 
board can perform any operation you may desire, and if it does not just 
wait  for  the card.  I imagine the sparse motherboard could  appear  a 
little  disappointing  initially,  to  those  who  purchased  the  self 
assembly kit. Remember, looks can be deceiving. 

With this kind of upgrade potential and the sudden burst of energy that 
is currently  in the Milan development camp it will not be long  before 
most  Milan owners will have heavily personalised individual  machines. 
We are all waiting for those all-important Power PC and Falcon emulator 
cards  then Milan owners can really kick some serious computing arse.

Speaking (or should that be typing) of upgrades a great idea is the TOS 
4.5  ( an advanced version of TOS 4 seen on the Falcons)  living  on  a 
'Flash  Eprom'.  The upshot of this is that the operating system can be 
uploaded to the Eprom by running a software package available from  the 
 Milan  website,  no  more  chip based upgrades (hurrah).  This leads me 
nicely to the  operating system. 

The  GEM  for all intents and purposes IS the GEM  available  with  the 
Falcon with a few additions such as cache controls and a lot more video 
modes than you could shake a very large stick at,  ranging from ST-High 
through  to  True Colour SVGA modes.  With all these video modes it  is 
very  easy  to create a few spare DESKTOP.INF files to  cope  with  the 
various  screen  sizes  and desktop icon positions.  Once  however  you 
discover  MING,  the GEM standard TOS,  GEM becomes a thing of the past 
(no pun intended). 

MING  is  the Milan's version of the ever popular  desktop  replacement 
"Thing",  with a few noticeable tweaks here and there. For those of you 
who  have used "Thing" at some point know what to expect,  for those of 
you  who haven't you are in for a treat,  as Thing/Ming is as close  to 
desktop  perfection  as you can get,  taking the best aspects of  other 
interface  environments  tweaking them,  and amalgamating them into the 
GEM  environment,   giving  Thing/Ming a familiar feel,  although it is 
vastly  superior to the standard desktops that have been  available  to 
date.

To complement all this operational grunt the so called Milan MultiOS is 
provided on CD-ROM (as is all the  packaged software) Milan MultiOS  is 
a  Milan  compatible  version of  MultiTOS  unfortunately  (showing  my 
MultiTOS ignorance),  I cannot get MultiOS to work so I cannot possibly 
comment, at the moment only dream of true hispeed Multitasking :( .

As  for  the  packaged software I was a little  disappointed  as  early 
reports  indicated  a  mass  of  well  known  internet  and  productive 
software.  Don't  get  me wrong for the most part the software that  is 
packaged  is  good,  however  some  titles that  were  reported  to  be 
available simply are not. 

So  enough of my moaning about what should or might have been,  what IS 
packaged?  Well firstly,  we have HD Driver 7, certainly in my mind the 
best  driver software available at the time of purchase.  Possibly  the 
 most well known package is Papyrus. Unfortunately to those who struggle 
with  their  German,  (you know what is coming don't you),   it is  the 
German Home version (Home= a few minor limitations).  A full version of 
ST-Guide  is  available and guess what?  Yep,  the German version.   The 
Smurf image manipulation package is available as a Home version,  Guess 
what?   It's  the German version (I see a pattern forming here).  QED a 
very competent text editor,  German version.  CAB demo,  Geman version. 
SPIN the PD CD-ROM driver, Not in German :). 

Long  term Atarians are used to fathoming German programs.  However  if 
Milan  intend to target 'others' they had better look to releasing  the 
software packages in other language versions as well.  All the software 
is  useful  as  long  as  you are willing to  put  in  the  effort  and 
experiment.  As an aside I would like to see Mario Bencroft's GEM based 
Pacman game packed in as the standard small game,  as it is blinding on 
the high-speed GEM environment that the Milan provides.

In  Conclusion   there  is not a lot to say other than  the  Milan  has 
replaced  my  Falcon  as  my main machine,  and  given  time  and  more 
compatible  software,  I  am sure it is a platform that WILL get a  lot 
more support before too long.
