†                          By Patrice Mandin 
 
It's 'Doom', it's back, and it's exactly as we know and remember it!

You may recall a preview,  some Maggies ago, of a hopeful contender in 
the  'who is going to be first to do 'Doom' on the Falcon' race.  With 
strong competition from Bad Mood, and with original interpretations of 
the  genre,  such  as 'Running',  anticipation was high that the  DSP-
assisted  engine  by a strangely familiar Data of Trio,  was going  to 
come in at first place to completion.

Since  then,  'Running'  has arrived,  been reviewed,  and is currently 
getting the level-by-level treatment (thanks Matt!) Bad Mood seems  to 
have gone off in a final terminal sulk,  and  that would seem to be it 
for now?

But  wait,  ID Software went all the way to making the 'Doom'  sources 
freely  available,  so  it  isn't surprising that someone is  doing  a 
'FalcDoom'  off  of these.  It is to Data of Trio,  or Patrice Mandin, 
that we are turning to applaud, as the man who has taken on this job.

There  are  a  number  of differences from  the  optimised  DSP  based 
original.

Firstly,  this  is  more or less a straight port-over of the  original 
'Doom' source from the PC.  This version is Motorola 68k friendly, but 
not  going  anywhere near the DSP.  If you have a base 16 mhz  Falcon, 
this has repercussions, more of which in a bit. However, it also means 
that  this  version  can  be  successfully  adapted  for  other  Atari 
computers  and  clone machines capable of a higher colour mode  and  a 
reasonable turn of speed.  So,  until 'Running',  the Milan edition is 
ready  for  spring of next year,  this is the best chance of a  decent 
game on that platform.

Secondly,  when I booted it up,  this wasn't just a walk-through level 
demonstrator,  it was the full game. It was 'Doom', on my Falcon, such 
a  simple  sentence,  such a significance!  Enemies were present,  and 
spitting  fire,  and  when I fired and re-cocked the shotgun  for  the 
first time, ah bliss!!

Thirdly,  there  is  some  sound.  The sampled sound effects  are  all 
included, but not the music, which is all in MIDI file format, and was 
of  debatable  quality anyway.  The tunes are available as a  separate 
file, if you have something MIDI compatible plugged in.

So we have a fully working 'Doom' game on the Falcy,  how well does it 
run?

I started with it going on my Centurbo 2 based 'Fast' Falcon. This was 
a sensible idea.  The framerate was good,  not perfect,  but certainly 
playable,  and on the quick side.  To compare,  it would be worse than 
'Running', which is a native Falcon production, with DSP code, but not 
too  far  off,  and about as good as,  maybe better than,  'Lasers and 
Men',  which was also a native Falcon game,  with DSP code! (Comparing 
these all on a 50 mhz CT2, of course...)

I then tried it at 16 mhz....

This was not sensible, it moved, but only just. The frame rate dropped 
right   down   to   'Lasers  and  Men'   levels,   with   considerable 
frameskipping.  I'm  sure  some  brave  people  have  managed  to  get 
somewhere with it like this,  but I gave up very quickly. In this sort 
of case,  DSP code may well make a considerable difference,  but it is 
unclear  if any further development of that side is taking  place,  as 
Patrice  seems  to be catering more for generic higher end  Atari  TOS 
clones?  I'm  sure  this would fly on the Milan?  I am also sure there 
will be more updates,  even from the time of this review,  to the time 
of  issue  release,  and these will be optimising further,  where they 
can.

Think 'Frontier' on the ST, and you have an idea of how 'Doom' on a 16 
mhz falcy feels! Even with a low detail mode selected, this still felt 
slow.

Funny bugs and glitches?  The game was generally stable, but there was 
the  odd  glitchy screen,  most noticeably on the between  level  menu 
screens.

There  is also an occasional keyboard bug,  with 'sticky'  directional 
keys,  if  you use the keyboard to move your player around the  level. 
This  is a very minor point though,  as you can use a Jagpad (yes!) to 
get around the game instead.

I needn't tell you what the game itself is about,  but this is clearly 
the 22-carat golden original,  that launched a thousand imitators. All 
that is needed is a compatible WAD file,  the shareware version can be 
downloaded  from a link on Matt Smith's homepage  www.shack.atari.org, 
and  it  isn't too big.  The latest version of Doom,  can be  obtained 
either  from the Dead Hackers pages,  or Patrice's own home page.  The 
latter has more links for other bigger WAD files. This game engine can 
run  all  the various WAD files available,  from the  basic  shareware 
version, right through to Doom 2.

Not to forget the versions of 'Heretic',  'Descent',and 'Hexen',  that 
he  is  preparing  to  unleash on a  stunned  Atari  world,  (probably 
doubling  the  number  of first perspective  games  available  on  the 
Falcon!)  I'm  not even going to mention the up and  coming  Atarified 
version  of 'Quake',  which will really only be a sensible proposition 
on something '040 based and upwards.

When I was playing it, my unhurried approach, picking off the bad guys 
as  they  came  towards  me,  paid off handsomely.  Best not  to  rush 
headlong into these things!

All in all,  Patrice has done the Atari community a very great service 
by finally porting over this classic, and very much messed around with 
by all sorts of people,  game to the Atari TOS platform.  Now all I've  
got  to  do,  is  get the keys to my time machine to go  back  to  the 
Stafford Atari Show,  and pick up that CD-ROM of Simpsons-based add-on 
Wadfiles I missed getting, the first time around!

Next step, the multiplayer Deathmatch option?

Do say, "It's here at last!"

Don't say "Will using the Blitter help in any way?"


 Ratings.. 

 Graphics:-  It's Doom! 'Nuff said really.

 Sound:-  It's Doom!! All the good bits, without the cheesy muzac.

 Playability:-   It's  really Doom!!  Tired and sluggish on  a  standard 
Falcy,  but  feels  much better on CT2.  Should perform well on  other 
accelerators and faster MC68k instruction sets too.

 Overall:-  You're Doom(ed) unless you get it!
