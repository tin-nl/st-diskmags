     ˆThe Firmly (but ‰notˆ Firm-Buttocked) Heterosexual Film Critic!

 Hiya  folks,  you  might know me as Gary Bushell,  everyones  favourite 
beardy  Bluto-out-of-Popeye lookalike,  forthright 'man of the people'* 
in  the famous 'Sun' newspaper,  and stout defender of everyday  bloke, 
from  the  waves  of bottom-banditry lapping at  the  fly-zips  of  our 
beloved national institutions.
 
* - Assuming 'people' in this instance all wear identical  paramilitary 
styled brown shirts.

 This  week,  my  boss,  Rupert  Murdoch  has asked me to do  some  film 
reviews,  looking  back  over the years at the best movies  ever  made. 
Well,  in  my capacity as moral guardian of the sacred temple of bloke-
ishness,  I'm going to be keeping a close eye for any encouragement of, 
well, loose-buttocked behaviour, that I come across.

(Omigod,  did I really say "come across" just then? That makes me sound 
like a poof! Am I a really a poof without knowing it, I've been feeling 
very lonely and confused lately and...)

Ahem!

We start with a good macho blast-fest, Bruce Willis's  'Die Hard, Man in  
 a Vest' - (Episode 1.)  

A good clean romp of an action film,  no girly stuff here, just lots of 
shooting  and  explosions.  The bad guy is a German,  played by foppish 
Alan  Rickman,   who  gets  his  at  the  end,  so  that's  okay  then. 
Incidentally,  people  like Rickman are described as 'Thespians',  what 
sort  of  perversion  is that then?  Sounds like 'Lesbians' to  me!  Do 
Thespians  do it with goats or what?  Keep away from my children if you 
know what's good for you, you acting scum!

Ultimately,  a  great  movie was ruined at the end when Willis and  the 
black  fiftyish cop character embrace at the end.  A simple clean manly 
handshake  would have been enough!  A great movie tainted right at  the 
end by gratuitious body to body contact!  Still,  at least they managed 
to keep their pink and wobbly bits off the screen.

Brown Hatter rating - One

 
The Horse Whisperer. 

Girly,  girly,  girly, just stop it right now! That Robert Redford, his 
ideal life-long partner is a full length mirror!  I bet he uses shampoo 
AND  conditioner  to wash his hair!  What's wrong with good  old  plain 
washing-up liquid, I ask you! 

And  he gets his prettified face on all those sauce bottles.  Hold on a 
minute....

That's Paul Newman on the sauce bottles, are you sure?!?!

Brown Hatter rating, paradoxical, 'Goldilocks' Redford ought to be 'one 
of them',  but he can't keep away from the girls.  What kind of pervert 
does that make him!!?

Some kind of reverse double-agent bender, methinks!
 

'Steel Magnolias' 
 
An  entirely  female  based film,  no Page 3 birds in it  sadly.  Wide-
mouthed 'Pretty Woman' Julia Roberts dies of cancer or something. Good.

Brown  Hatter  rating,  if they didn't slip the odd lesbian or  two  in 
there somewhere. I'd be very surprised!

 
'Four Weddings and a Funeral'   
 
Wimpish  floppy-haired  Hugh  Grant takes a couple of  hours  off  from 
dropping his trousers for tugboat hooker Divine Brown to appear in this 
tripe.  C'mon Hugh,  you've got gorgeous Liz Hurley waiting at home and 
gagging  for  it,  you don't need to seek sexual relief from  something 
that  looks  like an all-in wrestler?  Unless you're  one of them   Hugh? 

Brown Hatter rating, definitely something wrong here!


The  'Unbearable Lightness of Being'. 

I'm sorry, I'm not even going anywhere near that one, it reeks of being 
put together by Alan Rickman and some of his revolting 'Thespian' pals. 
I  don't  want  to  waste two hours  of  my  life  watching  high-flown 
political  manifestos artfully combined with  rear-entering  cross-eyed 
goats.  You're not just getting a hint of it, but the whole bloody lot, 
thrusting in and out,  and in and out and oooooohh!  AHUF!  AHUH!  Ahuf 
ahuff... Sorry, sorry 'bout that.

Brown Hatter rating, I haven't seen it, but probably five.

 
'The Guns of Navarone' 

Just  some chaps in a solid action film,  blowing up some giant  German 
coastal guns. So that's okay then?

Well  up  to a point it is,  as although there isn't much body to  body 
contact,  there  is  a  sodding big erection jutting out of  the  cliff 
edges, huge cannon, constantly discharging their steel ejaculate out to 
sea. I mean, if you had one THAT size, no boy would be able to resist.. 
Oh SHIT, arrgh!
 
 Brown Hatter rating - Fifteen inches! 

.......................................................................
 Emergency 'Sun Newspaper' editorial intervention. 
It looks like Gary's brain has finally exploded,  not with his paranoid 
anti-homo ranting disguising certain unpalatable truths about his  real 
sexuality, that stuff is normal for him. We are very concerned with the 
use of the term 'steel ejaculate' in a review. This is too much for our 
Mars-Bar  chomping  and somewhat inbred readership to take in,  and  he 
should be forcibly restrained...
.......................................................................

 Can I have my column back, THANK YOU!

Now, where were we?


Aha,  'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. '

More  like Chitty Chitty GANG-BANG!  Hardly likely for a weedy sounding 
Dick  van Dyke to be going around expressing core  heterosexual  family 
values. It's like getting 'Elephant man' John Hurt in to fix my central 
heating, inconceivable! And I bet he's one of those 'Thesps' and all!

Brown Hatter rating, It's so girly, it makes me SICK!
 
.......................................................................
 Emergency Sun Editorial people back again.. 
Erm  Gary,  this movie review business is obviously putting you under a 
lot  of strain,  why not take a break and write some of the TV  reviews 
for a while?
........................................................................
 
Hoh yeah! 

 We all know what 'TV' really stands for! Well if you want me to review 
a bunch of over-made up and hairy-legged cross-dressers. Well you can 
just go and stick that one up your junta matey!

- Storms off in a huff.


…Aftermath:-

 Gary  Bushell  was forced to leave his employment as  the  single  most 
bigoted  and fuckwitted newspaper columnist,  purporting to be a 'voice 
of the people',  shortly after this column was written.  A hardcore gay 
porno  movie,  "Beardy  gets  stuck into the  Locker-Room",  apparently 
starring  a  lookalike of Gary Bushell,  was found to have really  been 
made with the enthusiastic cooperation of the real thing!
