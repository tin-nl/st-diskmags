      Kosovo - A careless hand in the unlucky dip of wrongheadedness.

 Or, who will condone this insanity - Quite a lot of people, apparently?

One  of the major problems with war,  apart from the obvious  bloodshed 
and  nastiness  related  issues,  are the huge  bucket-loads  of  self-
righteousness slopping around the place.  The opinionated among us  are 
more certain than ever,  but the only truism of war,  is that everybody 
is  wrong  to  some extent or other,  and for someone  to  be   totally 
innocent,  is  rarer  than finding purple spots on a  performing  seal. 
 (That occur naturally, any fool can paint them on!) 

The  Kosovo  conflict perfectly demonstrated the  inability  of  anyone 
involved with it to get anything right. At the best case (of a hopeless  
case?) we are looking to see who is least in the poo?


  Hands on, hands off? Decisions, decisions! 

The  decision  to  go  for airpower on its own,  as  an  instrument  of 
Milosovich  slapping,  reflects  American  confusion  over  this  whole 
superpower  business.  They would like to rule the world,   but without 
any of the human cost, IE. dead bodies of its sons and daughters,  that 
entails from that desire. If they can keep this going for any length of 
time,  it  would  be a world first.  Unfortunately,this helpfully "non-
lethal" approach doesn't extend to  anyone else, including a lot of the 
friendly forces working alongside them!

This  'humanitarian'  approach is all very well,  and they may  get  it 
right  one  day,  so  *nobody*  gets hurt in their  dreams  of  empire. 
However,  it  does kind of suggest that it won't take too much to  kick 
the door in, if things went even mildly wrong?

 
 Top Gun gone Rusty?

 A  lot  of  deficiencies in NATO war-fighting came  to  light.  We  all 
remember  the bomb-aiming mishaps which took out the  Chinese  embassy. 
The  target   data  which may,  or may not have been based  on  a  1963 
edition of the Belgrade  A-Z!?

Additionally,  there  is a lot of debate over just how much damage  was 
done  by  all the bombing.  Not to buildings and bridges and  suchlike,  
which  was  very evident on the evening news,  but the 'morally  nicer'  
targets of the tanks and heavy guns of the bad guys on the ground.  Hi-
tech  laser and GPS (Satellite Ground positioning) are still  no  match  
for  cardboard  replicas of real tanks and guns.  (The Serbs  borrowing 
this technique from the Iraqis in the Gulf War, and from the Germans in 
WWII   before them.  Maybe the next generation of smart  bombs/missiles 
will have cardboard avoiding capabilities?

The  Serbs  managed  to  somehow shoot down  a  F117  Stealth  Fighter, 
although nobody is really sure what happened. The fact they only did it 
once,  suggests someone on the NATO/US side was a bit careless? (It was 
interesting  to  note  the 'bullet holes' in the  wreckage  were  small 
enough  to come from hand-held weapons.  As the aircraft was  allegedly  
downed by a SAM missile,  one would presume those bullet holes were put  
there afterwards?)

The real reason why US AH64 Apache Helicopter gunships weren't used, is 
coming to light too. Apologists suggest that these were being held back  
for  the  land invasion (which didn't happen.) A  more  likely  account 
suggests  that  the  crews  of these  machines  hadn't  had  sufficient 
training  in  using their night vision equipment  and  first-generation  
sensors together.  In other words, they needed to know where everything  
was  in  advance to avoid crashing into it!  The border country  around 
Albania  is  not  known for good quality Ordnance  Survey  maps!  Don't 
forget,  there  were  two losses of these machines related to  training  
accidents.

The  Russians managed to salvage some last minute Homer Simpson  'Doh!' 
points  when they cheekily nipped in to Pristina airport ahead  of  the 
NATO  big battalions.  In amongst all the "Tee Hee,  we got here first" 
style  glee,  it only slowly dawned on them that they had forgotten  to 
stash  a  few  bottles  of Evian in the  glove  compartments  of  their 
armoured arse-mobiles.  NATO,  generous to a fault,  let them have some 
of their spare cans  of Appletizer anyway.


 Talking a good Fight?

 Politicians  managed  to generate a lot of sound,  but not much  light. 
This may or may not be the first of a new generation of 'moral' foreign  
policy  initiatives,  after  all,  Kosovo  doesn't have as much oil  as 
Kuwait,  but you would think that the UK Blair government in particular  
had  discovered  a  shiny new toy to play with.  Elsewhere,  it  was  a 
slightly  different  story,  with  President Clinton  making  concerned  
noises,  but  holding up his hands and saying "Look,  no troops!" Other  
European  countries  joined in loyally,  but wisely kept  their  mouths 
tightly shut.

At  this time,  the jury is still out on whether the brand new  'moral' 
foreign policy is something that is going to be substained over a  long  
time, or not?

Back home,  many press commentators also liked to talk up the conflict. 
Many of them seemed to be disappointed that 'our boys' weren't going in  
righting  wrongs  at bayonet point.  The air war lacking the  necessary 
elements of heroic sacrifice that make a good story.  They seemed to be  
miffed  that  the naughty military were running things their  way,  and 
avoiding casualties for their people!  Of course,  the media can always  
run  a military campaign much better than anyone,  especially from  the  
comfort of their armchair, several hundred miles away!


  Liar liar, pants well and truly ablaze? 

There were a lot of untruths bandied about in this conflict,  to put it 
mildly.

Most of these were Serbian originated,  mostly crude and unsubtle,  and 
designed  for  home consumption rather than  international  opinion.  A 
Favourite 'urban myth' was the 'Marketplace bombing.'

These  were  the Serbian explanation for the refugee  column  bombings, 
where Yugoslav airforce units were involved (not the NATO mis-targeting 
mishaps  which  the  western  news  media  were  allowed  to  see.)   A 
'Marketplace'  bombing  goes back to the Bosnian  conflict,  where  the 
Bosnians were accused of setting up their own massacres (in a   crowded 
market  place)  to  get international sympathy.  This new  and  updated 
version  has the USAF and German Luftwaffe (!) bombing Kosovo   refugee 
columns in covertly 'borrowed' Yugoslav ground attack aircraft!!

NATO responses included bombing the Television stations,  a rather over 
the top method to secure objective news reporting values? And, did they 
really need to employ Blairite 'Spin Doctors' to control news  handling 
from the NATO side?

There  were  some  nasty stories closer to home,  with  the  incredible 
assertion  by a contributor to that repository of  reasonableness,  the  
ianpaisley.org  website  that  the Kosovans were  'faking'  stories  of 
massacres.  Sounds like the market-place coming back?  Similar forms of 
single-celled amoeboid life can be found doubting the Holocaust if  you 
uplift the nearest large stone!


  My enemies enemy is my friend? 

There  was some anti-war sentiment.  This was fair enough,  when it was 
dealing with the general waste and futility of it all. There were valid  
criticisms  about  the  conduct  of the  war,  and  the  NATO  inspired 
blunderings from the air.

There  was also a view that the NATO intervention was an attack by  the 
evil US empire.  The old sinister 'Military-Industrial complex' beloved 
of  conspiracy theorists.  A more objective viewpoint might well  point 
out that the USA is the most lacksadaisical evil empire in history, and 
all  their  actions in the Kosovo conflict seem to be  motivated  by  a 
wish  to  stay  out of it as much as possible,  but  being  reluctantly 
dragged  in by media generated public sentiment.   The USA may  well be 
Satan  to  a lot of people,  but if that is the case,  it is a slovenly 
couch-potato  Satan,  idly flicking through the cable channels to catch  
the  latest edition of "Fat people baring their souls live  on  daytime  
TV!" as opposed to doing something more definite.

The  other thing that happened sometimes,  was the overlooking or  even 
active  devaluation of the Kosovans plight whilst waving the  flag  (or 
protest  banner?)  to  try to stop  Serbian  suffering.   Consider  the 
following.

That KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) are a bit dodgy, they get their money 
from  drugs and are into the mafia and stuff.  We should't bother  with 
them, it's just helping criminals (tut!)

The IRA (Irish Republican Army) are honourable freedom fighters and  it 
is right for the UK government to negotiate sensibly with them.

So what's the difference then!?   Apart from the old chestnut,  "The IRA 
get to keep more guns from *their* peace talks than the KLA do." -  No, 
I don't think I'll go any further down that road!
 
Another  thought,  Tony Benn,  a well-known and affectionately regarded 
(now that he isn't in any danger of getting any real power!) figure  of 
the 'old left' here in the UK, didn't like the war at all. He said that 
this  should  have been left to  the United Nations.  And  like,  which 
countries do the UN peacekeeping troops normally come from?

That's right, the UK, USA, France, etc!


  An end to smugness? 

Bombs  dropped in the name of liberal righteousness make as many  holes 
in  people as bombs dropped by evil right wing  governments  practising 
Realpolitik!

Got that!

Okay, that's your lot.
