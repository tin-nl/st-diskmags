 
             ‰The EIL Party really realistic Realtime thing!
 
The Monday (moondog?) before.

But  only  just,  it  is  23.53 hours,  and thoughts turn  to  bed.  An 
appealing prospect, and only a few minutes away now.

This  'pre-amble  ramble',  to dredge up memories of an earlier  famous 
coding party report follows in a venerable (not to mention  vunerable?) 
tradition established by the Symposium '96, and ALT Party '98 reports.

Why 'vunerable'?

Well,  according to the opinions of certain others, there are 'too many 
words' in an article of this nature, especially at the beginning of it. 
I  suppose that they didn't see the point of Richard  Karsmakers  going 
off  on a personal tangent when he wrote his  record-breaking  articles 
for  ST News either..  Do the  people who complain of 'too many  words' 
actually make the time to use any reading skills at all?

This  next paragraph is eminently suitable for these deluded souls,  it 
cuts out the over-sufficiency of words problem, but manages to fill out 
a bit of space nevertheless.
 
Mmmm  mmmm  mmmm mmm,  hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm,  nurr nurr nurr nurrr,  daah 
dahh dahh daah, laa laa laa laaaa, har har har har! (Repeat 4096 times)

 NOW GO AWAY, AND TAKE YOUR FORESHORTENED ATTENTION SPAN WITH YOU! 
(The rest of you, don't worry, stay right here...)

 Well  never mind,  "they" might get their wishes granted this time,  as 
the  sort of time that I had for previous pre-party musings,  has  been 
cut  down  sharply,  which  brings me nicely onto my  first  discussion 
topic for the day..
 
Coding   parties   and  girlfriends,   how  to  keep  the  topic   from 
 spontaneously  self-combusting,  and how not to get splattered with the 
debris, when it does..
 
I had real misgivings about how I was going to break this one to Nicky, 
but  Felice,  in his inimitable 'bull in the conversational china-shop' 
manner,  did it for me before I was ready to myself. Still, never mind. 
Nicky said fair enough,  you've got your own life to lead,  but you can 
tell that she doesn't mean that at all. She is  really  thinking "Why are 
you  going  away and leaving me behind?" and in her  worst  moments  of 
self-doubt, "Oh, I suppose this means you don't love me any more!"

None  of which is true,  but you can also tell that if we were to  stay 
together  for  the  next thirty five years,  I would  still  be  gently 
reminded from time to time of this 'desertion'!

In case Nicky is reading back on this in the future, this is not having 
a  dig at her,  but this is a viewpoint which can be safely generalised 
to a great many other women.

About 98% of them, in fact!

And now, I'm really going to have to go for bed.. And this was going to 
be short!

Too many words?

 Maybe  not,  as  this  is as far as this bit went.  Things then  switch 
around  in  a confused sort of way to the commencement  of  the  actual 
realtime document. 
 
                   ˆCrazy upside down realtime text!!

 So why are the z and y keys the wrong way around? And where are all the 
punctuation stuffs getting to?

Answer,  this  is a borrowed Mega ST(e?),  the 'electrically dangerous' 
machine  that I've been discussing in the paper pad realtime.  It's got 
 an externally mounted power supply,  it only works with the case 'off', 
and  I get the feeling that one good nudge of the table will finish  it 
off completely.

Anyway, it is in a back to front sense, that I go back and start typing 
in the handwritten stuff I did earlier.

WOBBLE EVERYONE, WOBBLE, DAMMIT!

So here it is, the official start of the EIL '99 Realtime


08.50 hrs.
Northampton Station,  dawn peeks slyly through the windows.  I'm rather 
stuck for inspiration as this was probably the most difficult departure 
yet.

The (shorter than normal) pre-amble ramble may have given you a bit  of 
a clue here,  as Nicky,  who was never really happy with the idea of me 
going  to  EIL,  went  into totally unhappy mode  last  night,  cycling 
through  a  variety  of  moods,  none of  them  remotely  described  as 
'cheerful'.  This flattened the normal pre-party anticipation/excitment 
curve  somewhat,  so  I am now sitting on the train,  waiting for  some 
happy  vibes  to hit me.  At least she did put on a brave  face  before 
departure.

PS, I think a visit to the duty-free shop to restore the peace might be 
in order on the way home...
 CiH


08.55hrs.
The  train is making some interesting noises,  like it has a steel band 
drummer sitting under the wheels - hope it gets there okay, I'd hate to 
miss the plane.

I'm  meeting  the two Richards at Heathrow,  Felice and  Requiem.  They 
 opted to go by coach, the fools!

Judging  by  the large number of juvenile voices on here,  I think  the 
school holidays have begun?

Right, I'll stop now.
 CiH

(Sometime later)


11.55 hrs.
Hello Heathrow Burger King!  I found Felice and Requiem,  Requiem doing 
Homer  Simpson  impressions atm.  I've been not writing in here  for  a 
while,  as  it was a tad difficult writing with your arms pinned to the 
sides, as has been the case for the last couple of hours.

Strange  little sighting of the trip so far,  an upside down Fuji logo, 
one  of those mysterious scribblings left by the railway repair  people 
on a wall by the rail track.
 
The checking in queue looked tediously long, but Lufthansa decided that 
my big bag could be nodded through as 'hand luggage' - good for getting 
through  quickly,  not  so  good for having to tote it around  with  me 
through the airport.
 CiH


12.15hrs.
Security checkpoints, and the fun that can be had there, part 2.

Yet again,  Felice got stopped and searched, as they couldn't trace the 
source of what made their detector beep,  he got a full going over from 
the  security  guard.  I,  however,  must  have  skin made of the  same 
material as the outer coating of a stealth bomber as I got through with 
no probs.

 Now waiting, Lufthansa style.
 CiH

12.20hrs.
Still feeling strangely subdued, where is the party spirit?


12.21hrs.
We're flying out with a bunch of Dell PCs as cargo. Not going to EIL as 
well?!

Maybe to airdrop on Slobodan Milosovitch?

"We  surrender!  We  didn't fear the NATO bombing,  we didn't fear  the 
wrath  of  the rest of the world,  but Windows 98,  holy shit,  we can't 
take it anymore!"
 CiH


12.00hrs, Requiem hits the keyz!
Phew! It's warm on this here plane. As lots of sweaty teenage girls all 
jostle  together,  we're all seated at the very very rear of the plane. 
But never mind, we are here, and taxiing onto the runway.

Best quote of the day from Felice "So Rich,  when was the last time you 
had a woman then?"

Famous  Monty Python "Nudge nudge" scene follows.  I hope Havocs Falcon 
is in one piece, as the last time I saw it was when it was rolling into 
the  vast depths of Heathrows baggage hold.  It's now time to take off, 
so back later!


13.00, or 1.00. Felice takes over.
Well,  I arrived at Heathrow c 10.30am, things seemed to go okay on the 
bus  trip  down from Cambridge.  Now on the plane (after a short  delay 
waiting  for  CiH) we're listening to German messages from  the  flight 
 crew, and chilling out.

Req is right about lots of women around here atm.  I'm not sure if they 
are  all  teens  or in their early twenties,  but most of  them  looked 
pretty  nice.  None  of them dropped their knickers for us  however  :) 
(maybe that is something that nice German girls don't do till they  get 
married ?) :)

See you later.

Felice.


13.06hrs.
Who's  been  writing on the back of this sheet!  Now getting ready  for 
takeoff.


13.05hrs (?)
Still waiting.

 Takeoff, engines roar, aircraft rumbles down runway, etc. 

13.35hrs.
Mobile phone flying the plane!!! Who is that silly sod then? "So if you 
dial  0898,  then  you can lock the rudder and put it nose down into  a 
steep dive!?)


13.40 hrs.
Toffee  interlude,  courtesy of Requiem,  as everyones ears are popping 
nicely.


13.45hrs.
Requiem asks "Who will win the Falcon demo compo?" A good question,  as 
who  is actually doing a Falcon demo?" All the main  pre-party  rumours 
 seem  to talk about ST stuff?  Requiem thinks DHS will win,  but surely 
they're doing an ST demo too?

For  the graphics compo,  we came up with a close call between Agent  T 
and  mOd,  this time with mOd to win as he is overdue full  recognition 
for his work.
 CiH


13,55hrs.
Lufthansa inflight hefty homemade sandwiches catering for our hunger!

(Requiem falls in love with the stewardess!) 

(CiH resting from all of that for the party duration - weary sigh,  but 
happy face!)

Felice "It's been two years" (?)

Since he got a parking ticket?

Requiem - Cute stewardess serving the beer, does it get any better than 
this? Aaah, heaven!

Yes  it  does,  she  also has the fully completed source code  for  the 
Binliner megademo!?

GEEK! (say no more) - Requiem

It's my week off from hot babes and all that stuff!  - CiH

Evil  warned  me about this,  pack a cork for your butt,  he said!!  Uh 
oh.... (Requiem)

We're not talking about.... Baggio??

As if you couldn't guess! (Req)
 
As I said before, it's my week off from all of that! - CiH again

I   just  remembered,   Felice  got  'frisked'  at  the  check-in,   he 
deliberately  set the alarms off..  So I guess it wasn't two years  ago 
after all ;-) (Req)

Can I suggest a simpler explanation, I'm sure he's a terminator robot - 
got a ferrous endoskeleton or summat.

Plane going down, this is a short trip or what.

Don't forget not to mention the you-know-what! We're landing in the old 
Deutchse land very shortly. 
 CiH


16.10hrs(!)
Clocks go forward, and killing lots of extra time in Frankfurt airport.
 
Requiem  - I spied a free coffee booth in the waiting area,  Chris  has 
vanished  already!  I  think I'll join him for a much  needed  caffeine 
injection.
     
Felice - Yep,  well spotted there Rich!  Mind you, it was good to see a 
place a bit closer than the one down the corridor :)

16.20hrs.
Keep the time, dammit!

Felice  -  BTW Chris,  you said that  Req and I are fools for going  to 
Heathrow by coach - you came by train and were a tad late!

16.30hrs.
No, I was on time, you guys were pitifully early!
8am start beats a 5am start any day. 
 CiH
 
16.35hrs.
Looking  at a possible suspect package just across the way from me?  It 
is  a big square briefcase - ah....  Someone has just collected it.  No 
bomb squad japes this time around.

16.50hrs.
Felice  says Del Staples is still going,  is he a terminator robot too? 
He's looking for another ST or something - helllp!

Felice  got a job interview with the Ministry of Defence (MOD,  but not 
mOd!), possibly as a cruise missile warhead?

Leon,  MSG  and  Arnel are going to Dresden railway station.  Wonder if 
Arnel gets a reunion with the knifeman from Hamburg?
 CiH


17.10hrs.
Flight delay, whoopee!

17.21hrs.
Not quite as delayed after all!

 (Shimmer  forward to the party venue,  a cavernlike cellar somewhere in 
Dresden.)

 
20.10hrs.
Top travel tip for Felice - Don't store Mullerrice in an  unpressurised 
aircraft cargo hold!

The  party  place,  well,  what can I say?  It's an underground club or 
cellar  thing in downtown Dresden Uni'.  We've already been reserved  a 
storeroom out of the way for a sleeping room. Handy that.

MSG   makes  all  the  noise  for  everyone.   Overcompensating  for  a 
 fundamental nervousness, naah, I doubt it !

Top monitor tip for Protracker users - Yellow is not green!

Question;- How many coders does it take to change a plug?

Answer:- None,  they're all too busy arguing among themselves about the 
best way to do it! (boom boom!)

A  bit  of  news on the realtime front,  we're going to get  a  totally 
unexpected hardware injection at this party, a frankenstein genetically 
modified  Mega ST for the duration.  Seems to have had the power supply 
moved  outside  where it can do more harm,  and all held together  with 
lashings of evo-stik!
 CiH


20.37hrs.
The  Res Gods  are setting up in their grotty grotto,  Arnel says  they 
managed to traumatise people on the coach down with their  'pun-tastic' 
jokes!

20.40hrs.
Multiple  hardware failure bulletin!  This realtime has killed two pens 
already! We'll need that mega soon!
 CiH

20.45hrs. (Felice speaks...)
Yep, first good fatality is on me (as per usual - Sods law?

I brought some pots of Muller rice with me for breakfast times, and one 
has popped ;-) Never mind.


21.00hrs.
MSG joke, he does a weak Troy Tempest impression, with a tea cosy thing 
on his head?
 
Word for the trip is "potentially"  

21.15hrs.
Leon with borrowed and ancient VGA monitor,  going mono-mental, or just 
a bit greyscale?

21.55hrs.
Pizza ordering is taking place... Very slowly.. Felice has trouble with 
maths, 10 marks isn't 15 marks.

22.00hrs.
I  always thought that arguing about the bill came after the  food  was 
eaten. Arnel and co prefer to add more time on by doing it first!

22.30hrs.
A possible candidate for quote of the trip.

"How long is the porn, erm pizza going to take" (!!?) - MSG of course.


23.00hrs.
Big  comedy  chat  about the Mullerrice menace in our  midst  -  comedy 
article alert!

23.40hrs. (a long time in food waiting terms)
Atari kids hit the pizza!

23.45hrs.
Time for bed? There's always time for bed! 

 And so to bed....... 

DAY 2 - Friday 2nd April, First full Party day!

10.20hrs - (slugabeds!)
It's been a very eventful, not to mention a wakeful night.
 
We  were  pre-warned  about  Arnels snoring  tendencies  and  had  some 
misgivings about those. However, he was overshadowed by the soft tissue 
ripping  tones of Requiem,  who could have powered his bed out into the 
corridor by vibration alone! Drastic action was taken by Mr Pink, which 
worked for a bit.

Also, Requiem talks in his sleep.
"Jesus Christ, that compass has thirteen points!" (?!)

I remember Joe Cool stumbling in at some very dark/late hour to try  to 
bag  the  ST mono monitor,  which was covered by a  recumbent  sleeping 
Arnel. So no chance there!

Joe did come in handy a bit later on, as he pointed me in the direction 
of the toilets,  so I was able to kill off my pizza induced thirst. MSG 
remained  in ignorance of the bathroom location,  as he stayed  thirsty 
all  night..,  It  didn't help us that the room got very hot,  at least 
until MSG opened one of the big windows.
 
Going back a bit further to last night,  the pizza arrived, and I over-
ordered  a  bit,  as it was very much a greasy Symposium  style  pizza, 
which is okay if you're very hungry, for a little while. Otherwise look 
for  alternatives,  as it is deeply unappetising in too much  quantity. 
The  local chinese restaurant is strongly recommended,  and  reasonably 
priced, so maybe we'll give that a shot later?

Breakfast  is a 'help yourself' bread and various stuff affair,  and is 
free, which is very cool.

At this stage of the day, some Mystic Bytes peeps (esp. Grey!) and some 
Dutchies have turned up.

Travellers tip no.2 - DON'T sleep in the same room as Requiem!
 CiH


 10.30hrs (I think?) Felice on the keyz...
Well,  an  interesting  night all round really.  Req snored all  night, 
until  Mr  Pink did the previously impossible,  and turned into one  of 
Quake's   fearsome  monsters  (well  I  couldn't  see  if  he   changed 
physically,  but the sound that came out of his mouth certainly sounded 
like he had!)

Plus  the  fact that,  yes,  in the words of Pink,  "I was up to my old 
tricks  again" with my usual problems of bottom burps  ventilating  the 
air.  Fortunately,  they  didn't  smell (honest guv!) but the sound was 
something else!

Now for the present,  just met Grey and Winio and Peter (Mystic Bytes.) 
Grey  is  having some difficulty getting his Falcon to  boot  with  the 
supplied TV,  which doesn't sound good but is no big tragedy. Hopefully 
he'll get some luck soon ;)


Requiem has a go...

Too  fucking early to think.  Just fixed a Falcon,  just ripped another 
one  apart.  People  are turning up,  people speaking English  reduces! 
Hurry up Oliver!


13.10hrs.
Now right at the present, just finished typing in the notepad excerpts, 
didn't realise there was this much.. Off for a bit to circulate.... See 
ya laters. 
 CiH


13.25hrs (um ...)
Yep,  that  "Traveller's Tip No 2" is a very good idea Chris,  it might 
also  be hopeful to add that we put Req in a room with Evil and  Baggio 
when they finally get to sleep (if those guyz ever sleep). Evl admitted 
to me that he did snore, but that no-one hears him too often :)
 
Grey seems to be having some much needed luck with his Falcon at  last, 
getting  it to work with the supplied TV.  Hopefully it will stay  that 
way.

This German keyboard is verz ... um, very odd to use, but it'll have to 
do for now. We're all in NATO now so not enemies :-)

Mind you,  I wonder if Moondog is a personal member of NATO ?  It seems 
that  he  might not be,  as rumours suggest that a fight may break  out 
between  him  and  Mr Pink.  Mind you,  if Moondog  resembles  Slobodan 
Milosevic, then there could be a slight problem there :)

Signing off atm, see ya later ...

Felice.


14.10hrs..
Cheers Felice, I think..

Music  stuffs  being set up in this room,  other new  arrivals  include 
Moondog and some other POD people?  Not sure if Felice trying to set up 
a  fight with him or what?  (Should be an interesting wild  competition 
entry!)

Tommy of the Comic Pirates peers in through the door.

Food awaited, going on doing work strike until it comes. 
 CiH


14.15
No  worries,  Moondog  is  definitely a member of NATO,  and  does  not 
resemble  the other guy at all,  so I guess peace is for the good of us 
all :)

 Mind you, I don't know how he will react when he sees Mr Pink though !!
Felice.


14.16hrs.
With profound assertions of joy,  no doubt.  UCM almost have a realtime 
article running.

Nice to have a text editor to type into though.

Grey says that they've already 'released' (finished?) their competition 
entry.

Tips for people who've recently arrived in this room no.1

Don't open any bottles of coke that have been recently disturbed!

Going on another "See who's arrived sweep" in a minute.
 CiH


15.00hrs.
Food arrived.
Swedes expected.

If brevity is the soul of wit, my name must be Oscar Wilde?

Silly question of the day:- "Do you want cold coke, or not so cold?"
(There  is a choice??  Most stuff I've been drinking up to now has been 
the less than perfectly cold variety.."

When  we got our registration packs,  we were issued with these  bronze 
medallion things,  probably leftover shot-putting medals (womens event) 
from the old GDR days?

Found  out who the peeps are I'm sharing the room with,  these are  TNB 
(The  Naughty Bytes) from the 'old' Falcon scene.  Seems to be a  50-50 
 mix  of  Falcons and PCs,  so hard to tell what they are up to.  I'd be 
surprised if there was a competition entry from them.  Bloke next to me 
is  building  a  music  studio next to the  wobbly  Maggie  Mega,  must 
introduce  them  to Comp 7,  if he's coming to this lot.  (A meeting of 
mixing desks?)
 CiH


15.15hrs.
Psycho  Babble Maggie still waiting for its moment.  I almost got it to 
run on the wobbly mega,  but it didn't.  Don't really feel like finding 
out which proggy in the auto folder that it doesn't like.  Not to mensh 
the  fact that this machine runs off a graphics card,  so there may not 
even be access to 'normal' ST screen modes as we understand them?

Might get a chance if either of the Res Gods Falcons gets freed up.
 CiH


15.40hrs.
No chance at the moment.....

16.30hrs.
Psycho  Babble Maggie released!  Come and get it,  if it already hasn't 
been spread onto your machine!

Tried to ring back to the UK (Nicky) Phone makes ominious engaged  tone 
as soon as you hit a zero. People think this is perfectly normal?

There  are  some more arrivals,  it is hard to tell who is  setting  up 
where,  as a lot of the presently unclaimed 'reserved' tables are being 
casually used for eating, storage of bodies, etc.

This machine stays switched on where it is though!
 CiH


 16.50hrs.
Maybe you should have missed out the extra zero, Chris, when you dialed 
the code ?

Felice.

17.05hrs..
Indeed.. An extra zero a day, keeps the doctor away..

This  lot next to me have interfaced a mixing desk to  Digital  Tracker 
and a coffee percolator. 

Expresso Beats?  And PC demos?
 CiH

17.10hrs..
Top secet unreleased new demo under the Stax label which looks like  an 
ST  compo  entry?  Following  Mr Pink and MSG's "NDA"  (Non  disclosure 
agreement) policy, they will have to kill me and eat the evidence! Also 
anyone else in the room including themselves..

It's  an  "Industry"  thing. 
 CiH


17.15hrs..
It IS a compo entry.  Nothing to worry about me blabbing off early,  on 
current form, this won't get seen by the world at large for another six 
to eight months!
 CiH

18.30hrs..
Talking to Moondog,  he is suffering from a deep timelack like everyone 
else.  Interesting views on a bunch of stuff,  PC diskmags etc.  Felice 
found a new audience so he was happy too. Moondog looks a bit tired and 
careworn now.  Feeling a bit sorry for him,  maybe his head is spinning 
with the revolutionary new ideas from Felice? (g!)
  CiH


19.15hrs.
Yep,  Moondog certainly doesn't appear to be the person as portrayed by 
one or two unmentionable names here,  he seems to have some interesting 
views.  At the moment he is busy doing some graphics on a Falcon whilst 
listening  to  a groovy tune on his PC.  And - it's not an MP3 of  Flat 
Eric or the latest Spice Girls 'song' that he's listening to either  !! 
:-)

Felice.


19.20hrs.
Role  playing games suck,  esp ones based in Eastern Europe!  Moondog's 
'Falcon'  is an ST with the Falcon keyboard added.  Felice idea for top 
selling  game which does not mince its subject matter - "A  roleplaying 
game based on the Holocaust(!)"  
 CiH


19.35hrs.
Dutch people arrived,  one of the Swedish cars is still missing,  a few 
other bods not on site,  but surely most people are here. Swedish peeps 
being  fairly "swecretive" about what they are doing.  Or there may  be 
another reason why their backs are against the wall!!

Dutch Ppl, (Earx) unhappy, he was ripped off by 100 Dm on the way here!
 CiH


19.52hrs.
Phoned home (Nicky), everything okay there now - (Relief!)
 CiH


 22.57hrs.
A long time later....

Dutchies in the Building!

Most  people have arrived at the party now.  A party of us went out  to 
sample  the  high life in Dresden (Burger King!)  Got  back  unscathed. 
Felice reminded by the rest of us to take off his nametag and badge  to 
avoid  looking  like someone with special needs.  Got back  and  caught 
sight of part of another competition entry, this one by Checkpoint? Had 
to  avoid  looking too much at it,  but this one rocks too,  possibly a 
little  bit more than the Stax label ST demo,  but we'll have to  catch 
the compo to judge properly.

Tired after a night of sleepless fun, now starting to hallucinate the Y 
and Z keys are in the (proper) "English" position!

In  addition,  this machine was off the air for quite a while,  and has 
only  just made it back on.  Joe said that it wasn't running hot!  With 
the case as open as a black forest gateaux in the sliced position,  not 
too surprising!!

Looks  like  we're  still beating the UCM realtime,  but it is  only  a 
matter of time before they catch this one (in the act?) 

Save this before anything else goes down, Quick! 

Call  me  a part-timer,  but I might well play the well known 128  byte 
gametro "Hunt 4 bed" before too long?
 CiH


23.09hrs.
Don't you just love the way that leaving the final sentence ended  with 
a question mark always gives you the option to reopen the topic if  you 
change your mind? - Sneaky, eh!
 CiH
 

23:15 hehe... beating the ucm realtime article?! we'll see... shit... i 
helped  them  by myself...  who?!  the one and only...  or maybe not... 
moondog (huarg)


23.12hrs.
Moondog's  watch is fast!  What do he mean the "one and only,  or maybe 
not"  has  someone  been  cloning him,  maybe that is  one  way  to  be 
invincible  on  the  scene,   a  coding  party,   organised,  attended, 
competitions entered and won by clones of yourself..

"The Moondog '99 coding convention, the premier scene party attended by 
over five hundred people, all called Moondog!!"

Okay, this is getting very silly..

Z and Y in the right place rules!

Hey  guys,  this  is getting silly.  Don't you have anything else to do 
with  your  hard  earned time than to waste it  in  writing  real-time-
articles? In the end it will be impossible to beat us. Your frontier is 
*not* the ucm-article of this party, but the one written on the "black-
hole '94" in Gatterstaedt. 74 k of pure Hirntod. Muchas gracias.


01:55 st survivor
have no idea of the time now, i'm just trying to get something out this 
funny keyboard. Actually i have changed my mind, it's not funny and i'm 
getting sick of it !!! French keyboards rule (at least in France ;-)


-EOF- 
 
(er, not quite)

2.30 
I'm terribly sorry but this keyboard feels like a dead dog when you try 
to hit a key.  I'm not quite sure if it is a good idea to place it here 
next  to  the coffee machine which is is essential for  working.  Maybe 
somehow  I lose the grip and OOOPS there's coffee Shit gimme  a  tissue 
QUICK dammit Hm seems as if the keys feel exactly the same as they  did 
before so nevermind...  oh this space bar makes funny noise does it? OH 
GOD It's time CHeerS FXL

(Need to sample this fucking spacebar ... kind of rim shot isn't it?)

shot to four:

we are sleepin' now...  i hope so...
da music sucks... like techno - and so on... waahahh  good night!
yeah ... lets hope its a refreshing sleep, we'll now perform ...


 Day two, or is that three? 
Hey,  isn't it time for someone to shout out the fact that it's DAY TWO 
of the party, yes, it's DAY TWO!! Wake up there..

10.15hrs.
CiH back on the keys and bringing things right up to date?  Nice to see 
that  there has been some overnight interest in this text  whilst  I've 
been sleeping off.

The  sleeping room was more dominated by sleep related activities  this 
time,  there was a new noise coming from Requiem,  a sort of unscrewing 
of  a  rusty  pickle jar sound.  Maybe someone was trying to twist  his 
head off!?  Anyway,  got up and left him for dead,  also Arnel, the man 
who said we should "get up early to go shopping". Don't forget, this is 
the man who slept through the ALT Party!

 My TNB room mates are slowly coming back to life....

Other  people doing odd things,  FUN and Cream working on bits of their 
demos,  the  Swedes look like they've stayed up overnight.  Everyone at 
the stumbling around for coffee stage.

Someone  who  decided to remain nameless,  I suspect someone  connected 
with the UCM text,  but we'll call him "Mr 23.34", queried the value of 
this realtime effort. it is "not the UCM article of this party."

Well  spotted mate!  It is a totally different realtime report from the 
UCM one. This realtime differs from UCM's, in that it is mainly written 
by a diskzine editor/writer from another very well known diskzine,  who 
has  nothing  else to do at the party,  I do not have any  graphics  to 
draw,  music to compose,  or code to write.  What I do contribute is in 
the form of this text.

This  text also differs from the UCM realtime,  in that it is more of a 
personal journal,  with contributions from other people if they wish to 
add to it.  The UCM text is a traditional 'open house' affair with only 
the occasional input from the main UCM people. 

(It  is  also  useful to me in putting the  main  report  together,  in 
remembering names of people, places, times etc.)

As for trying to "beat" UCM's text,  the two realtimes are so different 
in  their  method.  If  it  were true,  it would be  something  like  a 
competition  between a weightlifter and a pole vaulter,  each insisting 
'their' way is the best!  In my opinion,  there is enough room for both 
at this party, Mr 23.34!

I'm sure that people would like to read another different viewpoint of
the  party,  but  as  I'm  just  a  diskmag  editor  of  several  years 
experience, what do I know about shit ;-)

We're just having fun here, do you have a problem with that?
 CiH
 

10.42hrs.
Guy with the music studio definitely awake!
I'm going away for a little while, see you back later.
 CiH


11.20hrs
Well, at the moment on this keyboard, there is one VERY HAPPY member of 
the  Maggie Team - me (Felice).  I have just been out for some air  and 
wandered into Dresden city centre, which, I must admit, looks real nice 
at  the  moment.  There are lots of people around as well.  From what I 
understand,  German  shops are not open a great deal around the  Easter 
period, save for restaurants and fast food places.

Anyway,  the  reason I am so happy is that I have finally been able  to 
acquire  a  copy of the new Crash Test Dummies album,  Give Yourself  a 
Hand.  I  have  been  waiting for this since I don't know  when,  after 
hearing  one or two of the singles over the Internet my enthusiasm  for 
the  band  in general,  whilst never waning in popularity,  improved  a 
great deal. I also hear that their earlier song, 'Superman's Song', has 
been nominated,  according to German radio, for nomination for 'Song of 
the  Millenium'.  I agree with that choice,  much better than the songs 
England is trying to get votes for. :)

(Which songs are those? - ED)

BTW,  the guys with the music studio are definitely awake but from what 
I have heard so far in the last hour or so,  they definitely have a lot 
more talent than any of those in the Spice Girls :)

Well, must go and put it somewhere safe :)

Felice.


 11.25hrs.
Looks  like UCM lost a large chunk of their text overnight.  A bit of a 
shit  deal  for them (I noticed it was very 'short'  first  thing  this 
morning,  but  thought  they had saved it to another disk  and  started 
again  for  day  two!)  Trouble with  a  publically  available  machine 
switched on overnight, someone, sometime will always fuck things up for 
you!

So  what  use is our realtime?  At least we've still got some  kind  of 
record of events of the first day!

(Weasel  chorus in the background hiding in the text,  tiny  speeded-up 
voices,  start chanting "We've still got a realtime,  we've still got a 
realtime!"

Travellers tip no.3:-
Why not hit Felice with an electric cattle prod stunner thing until  he 
calms down ;-)
 CiH


12.15hrs.
PC demo on Moondogs PC, think the 'Fatal exception error' screen at the 
end a bit of an overused cliche in the world of PC demo design?

Earx  doing  some lovely demo stuffs for the Falcon.  Even  works  with 
Centurbo 2, but not mine in its present 'DSP fuckoff' state!
 CiH

12.29hrs.
Windows  demo  on  Moondogs PC!  Watch those grey dialogue  boxes  fly! 
Running  it in a window loses the 'demo-ness' of it all,  and it  looks 
like an animation. 

Dadness rules!
    C i H

 12.45hrs.
Good  question  re.  PC demo design.  Why do most of the texture mapped 
bits look like something out of 'Quake?
 CiH


12.57hrs.
Well,  it  finally  looks as though Moondog is taking a break from  the 
fonts.  He's done a good job on them so far - I wonder if it'll be used 
for a future issue of UCM at some stage ?  Who knows, huh :)

Moondog showed me a rather good new PC demo that I hadn't seen  before, 
in the style of a MTV rock-video.  It's something I shall probably look 
to download in the very near future :)

 Cheers, Felice.


14.04hrs
I  thought  all  newer PC demos are in the style of an  MTV  video?  If 
something  *wasn't*,  that  would  make  it stand out  from  the  crowd 
perhaps?  Anyway,  we're getting off-topic badly here, this is an Atari 
party!

Back  at  Res Gods HQ,  MSG confused by double line on/off hassles.  "I 
just use Protracker and none of this VGA shit!"

Still,  as  Felice might say,  he still "has a lot more talent than the 
Spice Girls!"

This might be of use to some future realtime article producer??

 *Day Two* 

"Twentyfour hours and noooo sleeeep!"

"Too tired, but i`ll still finish the demo.)

"Dis partyplace still stinks / sucks / is cool!"

Now 15.00hrs

15.05hrs, actually :)

Just  had  the first of my unexploded Mullerice's that I  brought  over 
 with  me.  Luckily,  however,  only  one had gone off during the flight, 
seems strange though as to why it did that.
 
I think I may well drive here next time,  it'll enable me to be able to 
bring my gear over and get copies of some of the stuff that is floating 
around  here.  Moondog  has  a lot of demos etc on his PC's HD  that  I 
haven't  seen  before,  I guess I'm gonna have to download them all.  I 
must remember to get a CD writer before the next party (hopefully  next 
EIL at Easter),  it'll save on the excessive modem usage afterwards and 
should  also hopefully amuse Dave H and Pete A,  who like to see new PC 
-as well as new Atari stuff :)

Felice.


16.25hrs.
Dave H and Pete A like to see new Atari stuff? 

Don't forget to pay me back for the air fare first!

Ring  the  Mullerrice disposal squad,  the rest of them are still  very 
dangerous! And you're driving next time.??? Cool! Death race Felice for 
the whole journey ;)

Just  been  speaking to ST Survivor,  he is giving up on Toxic mag  but 
will be reporting on French scene stuff for Magggie and UCM in  future. 
He  gave us some strangely familiar reasons such as lack of  time,  and 
lack of motivation from other people.

There  may  be a combined Cream/tSCc production at the  party,  if  the 
ascii  info  text that I saw is anything to go on?  (Songs  of  Distant 
Earth?) tSCc, capitals in the middle, is that how you do it?

Got a problem with the Psycho Babble issue. It does not seem to like ST 
disk  drives!  F*cking  great,  an  ST diskmag that works only  on  the 
Falcon!  We'll have to recompile and see what sucks specifically when I 
get back. Bollocks!

Theory  A:  Floppy  drive  on Falcy is a bag of  pants,  remember,  I'm 
 talking  about  the (Ex) Floppyshop machine which has spent most  of  a 
very long working life copying disks! So it is bound to be shagged.

Theory  B:  Something weird with ST floppy drives,  single sided format 
(360K) done on a Falcon,  too many late nights.  moon in rising sign of 
Aquarius?!?!

 CiH


17.30hrs
I  just found out that Harald (ex-Lazer) is now counted as one  of  the 
Swedes, apparently he is now working in Sweden. He's here as well, it's 
great to see him again. Hopefully I shall speak to him a bit later on.

 (Errm no, he's still in Austria, Ed) 

We've  also ordered some more pizzas,  whenever they come through it'll 
be nice to see them :)
 
BTW Chris, don't worry about the dosh for the airfare, you'll get it :)
That is also one of the reasons for driving,  at least we can bring our 
own  gear including monitors etc and be able to do some stuff,  as well 
as talking to others.

Felice.


18:15  oooh,  it's MC Laser at the keyboard writing some lines for  the 
rival realtime article from the maggiebabes :-)


18.20hrs.
Ooh indeed!  Let us see what happens now, shall I go, or stay with this 
until the 1000 line mark?

I heard that Harald (Energiser) was coding on the Playstation?

Competition  deadlines have already closed for the graphics  and  music 
and  smaller  stuff,  and close at 13.00hr tomorrow for the big  demos. 
(Strictly informative)

Okay, go away for a bit after all.
 CiH


17.27hrs.
Naaah! Let's stay.

Trying to sum up the different moods of the party in a few words.

The Swedes - Apart from the ones awaiting pizza, quietly determined and 
working to NDA! not letting anyone see what they're doing.

This room, lots of music and Moondog, but pretty quiet.

 The Poles - they did their entry and handed it in,  messing around with 
old demos and games.  The people who most self-consciously came here to 
relax.

Cream  - Agent T spending ages on some exquisite photoshop stuff,  last 
time I looked in there.

tSCc and Checkpoint - the main room,  seem to be nearly done with their 
stuff?  Lots of transient visitors and internet fans hanging around the 
big Linux boxes.

The Dutch corner,  quieter than usual, only a few Dutchies, early Fried 
Bits parties had 30 or more! Mind you, this could be their best showing 
ever,  quality  of release wise.  (How we all miss those DBA 45 minute-
tros!) 

Reservoir  Gods  Grotto - mainly practising the banter for  their  wild 
compo  stand up comedy routine entry?  Some occasional coding breaks up 
the never ending stream of remarks.

Everyone else, gently chilling out, it's early evening, cool it!

Death  Race  Felice!  -  A new racing game for all  formats,  available 
Easter 2000!

"The  preview  is more talented than the Spice Girls!"  -  Jason,  Edge 
Magazine April '99 issue.
 CiH


18.50hrs or thereabouts

Been  talking to Harald of Lazer,  he has confirmed that the team  have 
been  working on a new game for the Playstation.  No I'm not quite sure 
if  it is gonna be called Eclipse or is being released on  the  Eclipse 
label.  Never  mind,  hopefully  we  can get this sorted  out  sometime 
shortly :)
 
It  certainly will be one game to look out for and get an  original  of 
too,  particularly if it is only available as an import in the UK for a 
while. I better get my order into CEX :)
Felice.


19.20hrs.
Baggio ordered a paving slab sized pizza!  (This could feed a family of 
four for a week, but not any family that Baggio is a member of.)

Got a rare prize from the Running Development Team, an original box for 
the 'running' game. Doesn't sound like such a big deal, but if you only 
got  a  plastic wallet originally,  a decent step up.  They had another 
fractal  fragment of an ST demo,  maybe the 'Stax' production described 
earlier?

Another  name  floating  around is  Firesoft  of  Switzerland,  putting 
together  a  robot  killer  game,  a hybrid of Falcon  code  and  Amiga 
graphics,  a demo of which is reputed to available shortly?  (but as we 
know "One month" in scene time, equals six normal months!)

It has been suggested certain Falcon demo compo entries might really be 
better off with a CT2 (!?)

Coming  up  to the 1000 lines point shortly.  At the rate this text  is 
building,  maybe  the  "74k of pure Hirntod" remark made by our  unkind 
anonymous visitor earlier might not be so far off the mark?
(well here it is)

                  **************Line 1000!*************

Celebrations break out across the party,  Maggie potentially real,  but 
in  reality,  unreal  realtime text reaches it's 1000th line.  Decline, 
despair, degradation and death awaits from here!
 CiH

 
21.30hrs.
Well, the previous two hours of no new text is a bit of a giveaway. The 
game that Energiser is working on is actually a version of the Jag  big 
bot  landscape smasher 'Iron Soldier' (whether it is still called  that 
on the Playstation is going to be another matter.) 

The  quotient of people working,  to people arsing around is going more 
in  favour of the people arsing around.  The volume is going up from  a 
caterwaul  of  sound sources.  ST Soundchip muzak has its  own  special 
place in everone's hearts.

Do not put MSG in with the Poles,  that would be two too many of a good 
thing!

The  most  pointless  pasttime  at the party must  be  going  onto  the 
internet  connection,  and looking to see what's new on atari.org etc.. 
Errm, they're all right here!

"But  I can't make 'Get up and walk and talk to people' to work  on  my 
browser!"

A fair sized chunk of Baggio's pizza hangs around the RG grotto,  still 
uneaten.

Off again.

  CiH (Third attempt to get the capitalisation down right..)


hoi  hoi...  because my machines are blocked i have to take this one to 
do something...  hum...  who is the man without machine? moondog... the 
delayed...


22.18hrs.
Blocked machine?  BLOCK CAPITALS,  first (music) compo starts at 23.30. 
 This is always a popular time for music compos.  Hope the neighbourhood 
is tolerant? Or failing that, they're all a bit deaf?

(Must retrieve vote sheet!!)

The  Poles  win  the award for the drunkest people at  the  party.  Not 
having a competition deadline to work against means more time for beer-
throwing contests.
 CiH


23.01hrs
Music  compo  starts soon.  Also first report of a new fake demo  crew, 
some mysterious people all the way from India!?  These are 'friends' of 
some  other  crew who could not come to the party,  so sent their  disk 
instead.  Watch  out for some of their closely adapted versions of well 
known Atari utilities..

Such as 'Dysentry Packer!'

(Ho ho ho!)
   CiH


00.25hrs
Music  compos  been  and gone.  I've refrained from voting so  far,  as 
voting in semi-darkness sucks deeply.  Also some kind of 'who did what, 
and in what order, and on which software' list might come in handy.

My own views, for the four channel compo, MSG in a more chippy sounding 
mode  than normal deserves a fair share of the votes,  but this section 
belongs to 505's effort which started off slowly,  but barnstormed into 
the lead. 

Tao  is going to walk all over the chip music field,  the multi-channel 
compo  had a couple of really outstanding entries,  Energiser's  clever 
use  of string effects on Graoumf,  and the module done on Flex Tracker 
 which seemed to dig into the DSP effects side of things.

The graphics compo follows a bit later.
 CiH


01.15hrs
Graphics  compo  done.  Same considerations/problems as for  the  music 
compo's.  For  the  16 colour section,  the FUN entry is way ahead in a 
quietly erotic fashion. For the Truecolour section, Agent T will almost 
certainly  win,  but  there are several reasonably strong second  place 
contenders.
  CiH

01.45hrs
Well,  some  generally  good  competitions there.  Most of the  picture 
entries consisted of something to do with nude women,  but that isn't a 
problem  right  now.  In fact,  cos none of the women here have dropped 
their panties for us, it may well have to do :)

Felice.


02.05hrs.
Possible quote of the party, take it away MSG...

"The future's so bright, I'm having to wear sunglasses."

Re.  The  previous  Felice  section,  did he have his eye on anyone  in 
particular?  ;-)  If  so,  should  we give them fair warning and a  ten 
minute head start?!
 CiH


02.55hrs
Showing prerecorded and annoyingly cut about sections of demos.

 Re-showing  the competition entries at 3.00pm tomorrow,  the reason  is 
that  many  people did not get to see the screen  sufficiently.  Sounds 
like a major problem for the main demo compos later on?

Arnel gone to bed, won't see him for a long time now.
 CiH

03.00hrs.
TNB  bloke  going to sleep under this desk,  might be an idea to  leave 
this for now.
 CiH

 
Day  Three  of the party being shouted out right  now!  Compo  entries, 
sleeping people in body bags on the floor, more!?!

 09.35hrs
And look, we've still got a working realtime!!

After  all the crashes and hassles on this machine from the morning  of 
the day before,  it is amazingly, still running from where I left it at 
3.00am last night.  So here I am again,  most of the TNB guys are still 
asleep,  or  not  letting on if my keyclicking is making them  wakeful. 
Will  have  to play the ever eternal 128 bite (geddit!)  game  'Hunt  4 
breakfast' shortly.

Sleeping  room  funnies.  Last night we had MC Laser and  the  Paranoid 
guest-sleeping with us.  Not overly comedic, apart from Paranoid's army 
surplus  sleeping  bag,  which had arms in it to "Allow you to  ride  a 
motorcycle."

Now who would want to sleep and ride a motorcycle at the same time?!

My sleeping bag just allows me to sleep on the floor.

With  Requiem  absent,  Arnel came more into his own as a solo  snoring 
performer.  At least he takes breaks between acts,  Requiem tends to go 
 on all night.
 CiH


                    **German Toilets, a digression**
 
Now  what is it with the design of some toilets over here?  Just  about 
every other toilet I have encountered in my life works on the principle 
of the 'long drop',  that is,  ensuring a speedy a trip as possible for 
solid matter to the sewers.

If I can get some kind of ascii working on this cocked up keyboard,  it 
may look something like this...

Now  a German toilet seems to have an extra 'shelf' on it,  intended to 
'catch' anything before it hits the water..

Awake  and probably have been waked up by the annoying key click  sound 
:-)  (which I MUST sample later on)!  I read this interesting RFC above 
dealing with the 'German loo problem'. 

The  answer  is,  kids - have you ever noticed that s### dropping  from 
your  butt  at hellish speed causes kind of fountain when it  hits  the 
water  surface?  Depending on size and weight this effect may vary from 
'blip' to 'Glunz-Blatsch'*).

The  fathers of this 'poo stopper shelf' found it comfortable  that  in 
such  a  situation,  this  fountain  won't occur and  wet  your  family 
planning devices when you're sitting on top of this throne.  device and 
causing the problem.   

*)Try to read it as-is and listen to how it sounds!
Believe me, I'm a German who daily deals with that.

FXL/TNB out for coffee now.

  
11.40hrs
Even  though I have had some sleep for just under 6 hours,  I am  still 
yawning,  however,  old  snorer of the night formerly known as Arnel is 
still in bed, even though he went before us last night :)

Having  wet  testicle  hassles with normal toilets?  Try  putting  some

'splashback' effect!

According to the theory that you recognize a culture from their  toilet 
structure,  let's  get  it  straight:  Have you ever been on  a  French 
toilet?  It's  like  going back to stone age.  Let me give you a  brief 
overview of the scheme:

From up:

       |--------- Waste entry
 __    v    __
|  |  ()  |  | 
|  |      |  | <-Foot stands
|  |      |  |
 --        --

Sidewards:



   _________
__/         \___
 

This is all.

Nevermind  that  it  is  that low  equipped,  but  the  dropping  speed 
increases  unbelievably as you stand on the stands and try to  hit  the 
goal  whithout  hitting yourself badly.  And - the paper trick  doesn't 
work at all.  The next user will have a bunch of fun to make the system 
working again.

So - anyone's experienced with other countries' toilet systems? Let the 
editor know.

Back for coffee agein,
FXL/TNB

Toilet 'system reset' - nice little handle to "flush" the system!

So this is how you *really* reach international understanding and peace 
and  harmony  between  nations,  you compare notes  on  their  sanitary 
systems!

I can see the headline now..

13.00(ish)hrs.
Compo  entry deadline thing about now.  Lots of messing around,  not so 
much work being done now.  There may well still be the odd game release 
from Paranoia or someone still to come?

NoCrew entry for 128 byte compo, and Falcon demo too?

The Polskis did a good thing to get their entries in early on, now they

Kobold atm :) I shall have to get over to Gdansk sometime and see where 
these guys hang out :)

There  has  been some neato 8-bit stuff running on an XE  in  the  tSCc 
area.  Particular  mentions go out to an interlaced graphics slideshow, 
some  greyscale  textured  3D (Cube,  with moving textures too,  and  a 
Wolfenstein Dungeon), also a bloody fast raindrop/water ripple screen!

Annoyingly  cut  about tape of Falcon demo  highlights  showing  again. 
Seems  to take liberties with Avena and Digital Chaos demos with  music 
by Tommy.  The music is subtle and slowly building, and for it to work, 
you need to see the whole demo, not just selected parts of it.
 CiH

 
13.55hrs.
Compo entry deadline put back to 4.00pm, this could go on forever?

(Don't  forget,  they're allowing demos to be shown in an  'unfinished' 
state in any case, giving two weeks after EIL to finish them.)

German words very frequently used at EIL that *anyone* can understand!

Further Digression coming up, 


   *The case of the mysterious missing furniture in the student halls!* 
        
Now we've got our own sleeping area in the student halls of  residence, 
shared  only  with interlopers such as MC Laser and Paranoid  (and  his 
motorcycling  sleeping  bag.)  There  are  also  communal   facilities, 
toilets, showers etc that are available too. 

But  these  all seem to have a creepy and deserted feel,  and  have  no 
furniture of any sort?! For example,

The  kitchen,  two  cookers,  two  sinks,  lovely  institutional  style 
(school/prison/hospital) lavatory tiled floor, errm, that's it!

There  are  some toilets arranged by the same  interior  designer  with 
austere tastes, complete with a single sink, cold tap only..

It's  as  if this is a level for a computer game of  the  first  person 
perspective  Doomino  kind,  but  at the very beginning  stage  of  its 
design, or a 'Low power, low polygon count' special.

Also looks something like a huge old mental hospital gone downhill, and 
stripped  of all the portable stuff by the bailiffs (Yes,  I'm going to 
have to say it, "Everything but the kitchen sink!")

So where's the rest of it got to?
 CiH

 
14.25hrs
Thinking for just a moment,  the probable answer to that is,  that half 
 of it is being kept in our storeroom/sleeping area!

There  is  a fair bit of broken vintage computer  equipment  in  there, 
including one abandoned Mac,  a cupboard at the foot of my mattress/bed 
contains the East German (DDR) home produced equivalents of 'Hooked  on 
Classics', (by the Amiga label, no less!)
        
MSG  may well be sleeping on top of the missing kitchen cupboards,  for 
all we know!?
 CiH


15.00hrs
You may be right there Chris, but I don't think the gear in our room is 
broken,  it probably all works but is in bits for one reason or another 
:)

MSG sleeps during the day ? Not on your nellie !! :)

Showing the compo entries again, looks like I've f*cked up my votesheet 
bigtime!  Tried to put it back into some sort of order,  the way it was 
supposed to be completed. Looks a mess but I think the ones that I want 
to get the points are adequately represented.

Chris is not the only one to mess up his votesheet btw,  I think I have 
done  a  similar thing.  Next time,  I shall ensure I have something to 
rest on,  preferably a Conrad Electronics catalogue (of which there are 
a  few about).  Now,  for some reason my throat is feeling a little dry 
despite drinking Coke, I hope I'm not going down with a cold :-(

Amigo Pizza seem to do everything,  so I'm gonna try a curry. I'm bored 
shitless with Pizza right now,  and the time is perfect for a blow-out. 
(Final evening.) Probably ordered roast camel and chips with my limited 
grasp of Deutsch, but who gives a stuff? 

Toilet  humour bit of this realtime seems to have been read back  by  a

First  full Stax demo viewing,  the file size is only 147076 bytes,  so 
it's  not  quite a 96ktro.  Still not sure if this is an  actual  compy 
entry  or  not,  or even if this is going to be released at the  party? 
There is quite a heavy guest group presence on there,  mainly people at 
the party.

Where  has  the  food got to,  I've gone from vaguely hungry,  to  very 
hungry now.
Agent T has a lovely hi-res desktop! (Okaaay, so it's on a PC...)
People who code ST demos on Pacifist rule!
Falcon demos that look good on Centurbo 2, may yet rule?
Indian food also rules, but is a long time getting here!

Food finally came in from India or wherever. I've eaten worse, which is 
the  best  that can be said.  Also 'liberated' a disused vote form,  so 
going to have a go at addressing the abortive mess that is the original 
voteform in a minute.

Did a dodgy currency deal with one of the Poles, he had a couple of UKP 
left  over from a previous visit to the UK,  so swapped a handful of DM 
for them.

Moondog  has  got  a Falcy again,  so he can write "rude  reviews"  (to 
roughly quote him.) He's sitting quietly in the background touching  up

I'm  a  genius,  albeit of an accidental persuasion!  I got the  floppy

production  looks like a small farewell screen,  the intro screen to  a 
modfile compo?) Winio is trying to get his demo shown on a CT2? Some of 
 the  3D  stuffs are reported as beautiful but very slow on  a  standard

Mind  you,  if  u  go for Club,  make sure it is  the  US/International

some demos shows,  more to come, organizers have probs with their video

Yep,  the  demo  competition is just about over.  There were some  good 
entries (I particularly liked Mystic Bytes' new demo, this was good) as 
well as MSG's very tuneful MOD in a world of untuneful MODs.   The wild 
compo is a bit shit though :(

The kind of music and videos played would probably get shown on Channel 
4  on their late-night weird-shows,  and the music is the kind that  is 
played by Radio 1 - ie, complete and utter crap.

Felice.


02.05hrs
 COMPETITIONS RULE!!

A  load  of  impressions,  not  easy to sort out,  a  blur  of  amazing 
happenings from start to finish.  It is gone two in the morning,  it is 
the final day of my sojourn in Dresden.  my feet are killing me,  and I 
feel  like  I  am living in an 'old' and misused body.  A bath,  and  a 
really good nights sleep are what is needed right now.

Still, I must try to separate the layers of confusion.

Checkpoint!!!!  Need  I  say  more,  must I say any more..  This is the 
killer  ST  demo ever!  Seemingly never-ending,  and one brain  blaster 
effect after another. This party surely belongs to him!

ST  demos,  a  very high standard of entry,  from Mystic Bytes,  DHS and 
Stax.  Not  one  weak effort in there,  and apart from Checkpoints hard 
earned first place,  very difficult to separate and make a judgement. I 
want to take them all home with me!

The  Falcon demos seemed to suffer a lot more from technical  glitches, 
and  Earx's  demo in particular,  wasn't shown at its best on  the  big 
screen. DHS  came  up with a shortish but superb entry,  but here,  the 
Centurbo 2 should go to Winio,  with his beautiful but slow 3D demo.  A 
lot  of  people  don't seem to think that  complex  objects  should  be 
attempted on the Falcon, but I say top marks for trying!!

The  fake demo section had a higher standard than for some  time,  with 
Poets  of  Bombay  effort 'Ibiza' surely gathering the  'rump'  of  the 
votes?

Reservoir Gods should clean up the 128 byte category.

With  reference  to the wild compo,  I would have to disagree with  the 
Maggie  commissar of popular culture,  Felice and some earlier comments 
he  made.  Some of the music was a little 'ho hum',  but I found myself 
getting  into  the tunes anyway.  The video did tickle my  appreciation 
buds  quite a bit,  emulating a lot of current and past favourite  demo 
 techniques.

Defjams  'Ascii  torus' was a big hit,  as was the impressive Sound  to 
light software right at the end.

I want to take all of these home with me too!!
 CiH


02.28hrs 
Right,  I  think  the people in this room want their bed,  so I'll shut 
down for a while and come back later in the morning.
 CiH 
 
02:35 there are some ppl sleepin' now, but the rest is still alive and
      will bring this party to a glory end !
      

   
Long, long after the last message... Moondog is a lamer. 
(For readers of this mag probably nothing revolutionary new!)
He  spreads things he shouldn't do.  That's why I'm writing on this  RA 
and not in pod ones... Never trust a moondog! drizzt/tnb

 
Final Day of party. 

08.55hrs
This  is the first proper attempt by CiH to wake up.  I was "awake" for 
the  prizegiving ceremonies at about c.08.00hrs.  Joe Cool bashed  down 
our  door  to  tell  us  the prizegiving  was  "soon".  I  passed  this 
information to Arnel who said "Oh,  okay then," and went back to sleep. 
I wished I had too, but soon woke right up when the ceremonies started.

Stale bread for breakfast rules!

There  were  the usual crop of outright winners and  surprises  at  the 
 prizegiving.  Checkpoint  won the ST demo section handsomely,  Agent T, 
the truecolour section,  and Havoc the 16 colour section,  Mr Pink made 
the 128 byte competition his own. All more or less predictable.

An  exciting element of uncertainty came into effect when MSG  won  the 
four  channel modfile compo,  this from a tune rescued from his  'dead' 
folder  and hastily submitted in lieu of his 'real' competition  entry, 
which was way too long for the time limit.  The Falcon demo competition 
was  a very closely run race,  with DHS just pipping FUN at the winning 
post.  Natural  justice was also served by the Poets of Bombay  'Ibiza' 
fake demo winning that section.
 CiH


09.06hrs.
We're getting rapidly to the stage where some kind of summing up of the 
party has to be attempted, might as well try now....

Mega  thanks have to go to Joe Cool and all the other party  organisers 
for going to such trouble as to make our stay more comfortable than  it 
otherwise  could  have  been!  Several welcome innovations,  such as  a 
decent  sleeping  room,  breakfast free of charge,  and food and  drink 
constantly available were all brilliant.  The standard of care was very 
high,  and I feel that the organisers really put themselves out to make 
the party work!

I owe a special thanks to Joe for the loan of this miraculously staying 
working  Mega ST,  without which,  the Maggie realtime journal would be 
very,  very different. How could the world have stayed unexposed to the 
concept of the 'Poo stopper shelf' in German toilets?  But without this 
computer, that is exactly what would have happened. 

Big-Ups also go to the co-occupants of this room, the 'remains of TNB', 
who  are  an extremely cool bunch of guys.  Thanx for the  coffees  and 
Beer! 

Hellos  go to all at the party,  but in particular to The Polish  Guys, 
 Earx, Moondog, ST Survivor, The Paranoid, and everyone else I talked to 
over the past few days.

The party itself was three (four?) days of sublime bonkers madness, but 
out of such a madness, the best times of your life are born!
 CiH

This  last  bit  is  more or less the 'official'  close  down  of  this 
realtime,, although it will remain open as long as there is power, just 
in case there is a little more to come.

I  would add,  there will be a report separate from this article in the 
narrators perspective,  it looks increasingly likely that this realtime 
will  run as a document in its own right,  due to its being larger than 
normal.

See ya later babes - CiH


 But, what is this??

 12.35hrs. (Monday)
Freddies Back!

Here  we are with a couple of hours to kill at Dresden airport.  We all 
badly overestimated the time for our flight, so we're sitting with Loke 
who is waiting for his own flight.

This is the resurrected Maggie pen 'n paper realtime,  a "Make your own 
entertainment" special, with the total lack of it around these parts.

The  genetically  modified Mega ST computer generated  realtime  was  a 
roaring  success with about 60-odd k of text generated.  This is now on 
two separate disks,  and also backed up onto MSG's Falcon. Just to make 
really sure,  it is also still on Joe Cool's machine,  if we get really 
unlucky.

14.10hrs.
The Atari 8-bit stuff in the projector (tSCc) room was courtesy of  the 
Mad Butcher.  Apparently, he's doing an artwork CD-ROM for all kinds of 
Atari related stuff,  cassette cover boxes,  arcade machines,  posters, 
and  more.  He was doing a 'multimedia' interface for it at the  party. 
Pure self-indulgence, but great if it gets finished.
 CiH 


 16.15hrs.
 Shimmer forward in time to Frankfurt airport, and any closing thoughts.

 Generally, I thought EIL was a good party.

There  were many funny moments with all the guys,  and it was fantistic 
to meet (finally) Grey and the other Polish dudes, and also Moondog and 
the guys from TNB. The evenings as well as the days were good, and I am 
pleased with getting the long awaited Crash Test Dummies album.

Competitions and results were well deserved. :)

Hi,  this is my final entry for the realtime.  I'm exhausted,  have had 
*very  little  sleep*,  but have had an awesome time!  505,  Spion,  and 
everyone else involved in organising the party,  thank you!  Absolutely 
great work, this one will be talked about for along time to come.

To everyone there, hi!! You're all great!
