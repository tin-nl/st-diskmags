                           Collated by Felice
 
(NUT, please feel free to answer any or all of the questions below, but 
try to give fairly detailed answers where you can, rather than just one 
or two words. Cheers m8 )
 
You bet! :)

                                  ---
 
Can you give us a bit of your life history so far ? Where you were 
born, which schools you attended, etc.
 
                                  ---

Well,  I  was  born and raised in Utrecht,  Holland.  I did preliminary 
school,  then the junior high, and then I started a middle class school 
but  I  never finished it up to now...  I'm a 23 year old fool  with  a 
strong love towards Atari's computers :)  

                                  ---

 How did you get involved with Atari computers in the beginning ?

                                   ---

Well,  my  dad  bought an Atari STfm in 1985 (1986?) when the STfm  was 
first on the dutch market...  I enjoyed working with it...  And started 
loving  it  from day 1.  then my dad bought a MAC and I got  the  STfm, 
after  that I bought a STE and later a MegaSTE and now I'm  even  stuck 
with  2  TT's and a Falcon :) only thing I regret is that  I  sold  the 
STE... it was the biggest mistake I had made in my life... :(

                                  ---
 
How did FUN start up, and what prompted you to become one of the 
active members of FUN ?

                                   ---

Well,  how  FUN started you'll have to ask Bonus sometime...  but how I 
joined was kinda strange...  I got on irc and met earx, then we decided 
to meet in real life and he told me about FUN,  I had scene/programming 
desires so I decided to join... 

                                  --- 
 
We  heard  a  little  while ago that you intend  to  build  a  hardware 
solution  to enable all STs and Falcons to be connected to an  Ethernet 
network.  Where did the idea for this originally come from ?  (It might 
also be an idea to document this from the beginning,  for non-scene and 
non-online readers)

                                   ---

Well,  I hated the fact only mega's and TT's had the ethernet cards and 
I wanted to unify the atari community... one thing for every atari... I 
have been busy exploring more possibilities,  so I have to say the work 
has  not  been done yet...  No real news to tell,  only that it WILL be 
finished :)

                                  ---

 Which demos have you enjoyed the most ?

                                  ---

 PC's   - SHOOT THEM!

 Software piracy  - If it's from Microsoft, why not...

 UCM  - Sorry for you guys, but I like(d) it...

 Tommy  of  Avena  -  Sad,  but I didn't really know him,  so I can't say 
                    anything about it...

 Baggio :)  -   Met him at PMP, and i think he's COOL... he RULEZ! :))

 The emulation scene  - well... lets not start that shall we? ;-)

 Your fellow FUN members (active or otherwise)
