                 ˆBest quotes to greet the new Millenium?
 
"I  have no millenium message to give to the F*cking world!"  -   Harold  
 Pinter. Miserable bugger by appointment to the world of literature!

 "I would like somebody to invent a spray can for peace. I promise to go 
around  the world and spray who and whatever needs it.  I know I have a 
big  job  ahead of me,  but such a worthwhile one!" -   Paloma  Picasso,  
 making  Gywneth Paltrow look like someone who fights wild dogs  with  a 
broken bottle in a rubbish skip for enjoyment! 
 
"It did change everything.  Arbitary or not, it extended our temporary, 
mortal selves over the ages.  It was a moment when 1,000 years of peace 
suddenly seemed to be a human possibility..." -  Bryan Appleyard of  the 
Sunday  Times  getting way ahead of himself here.  Then  the  champagne 
stopped  flowing,  and  it  was time for reality to reassert  its  ugly 
hungover self once more...

 "To hide behind reality, to know something, to give something, whatever 
it is.  We need all the help we need.  We will not hide..." -  Catherine 
Zeta-Jones  winning  the  breathless Psycho-Babble  award.  So  Michael 
Douglas is marrying her for her MIND then?!

                            ---------------

A  mate of mine got done this week for not having a TV licence.   Which 
makes  me think why doesn't the computer industry clamp down on  piracy 
in a similar fashion? ( Oh, but they will! - CiH)  

I imagine in the near future,  that Microsoft will have little detector 
vans  driving round the country,  passing every home and business,  and 
trying to lock on  the 70hz signal you get from any normal VGA monitor.  

They then look you up on the laptop database in the back of the van  to 
see  if  you have registered your copy of Win 2000,  which 97%  of  the 
country will be forced into using by then.  If not, they will then come 
round your house and kick your head in.  Well at least suss out you are 
using a pirate copy,  you got from your mate down the road who has a CD 
burner, and then kick your head in!

Imagine the scenario...   :o)

CiH relaxing at home, reviewing some demos on the Falcon....

A van with 'Microsoft Detector Van' written on it,  screeches to a halt 
followed by a loud thumping at the door.  BANG BANG BANG!

VOICE  THOUGH LETTER BOX:- "This is the "This is the  software  police, 
this is a bust!   Piracy is very,  very naughty!!   Throw the CD on the 
floor and come out with your hands up.!"

CiH:-  "I'm  not using PC,  Windoze 2000,  or any Microsoft package,  so 
what's your problem, braindeath-breath?"

Cop #1:- "You have a computer, what else can you be using?  Our records 
show you are not any sort of long haired deviant Macintosh user."

CiH:-  "We are just looking at the latest Reservoir Gods production  on 
the  old  Falcy,  it's been ages since they kicked anything  out,  it's 
about time and all!"

Cop #2:- "Er,  That strange wedge shaped piece of grey plastic does not 
look either like a predatory bird, or a Windows PC?"   "Hold on, what's 
this?" (Triumphant note in voice) "Admit it you have a PC there,  look, 
under your desk!"

CiH:-  "That's not a PC,  it's a SCSI burster equipped tower case  from 
that mad Robot Wars fanboy, Chris Crosskey"

Cop #2:- "A scuzzy buster, what the 'FUN' is that??!?"

Suddenly another masked software-cop comes crashing through a skylight, 
sending  glass  showering all over the carpet.   He holds  a  bar  code 
reader  which  is  running Windows CE v3.0  beta  2.1101b,  and  pushes 
against CiH's head. "FREEZE!!"

Being a beta,  and being confused with the old and crumbly Windows 3.1, 
it does.....   

Cop #3 takes one step forwards,  and his foot finds a large Atari CX-80 
trakball controller. He slips up spectacularly, sending him crashing to 
the  ground,  inflicting  a large bruise to his head.   The trakball is 
unharmed.

Cop  #3 (Struggles up,  he is encumbered with a shedload of kevlar body 
armour  and anti-riot gear.  Perhaps he is having second thoughts about 
the pose value of all this stuff?) 
"What  no Playstation CDRs?   No gigabytes of MP3s on this (taps  cheap 
biro with badly nibbled end against SCSI tower case) thing?!?"

CiH:- "Well maybe the odd giagbyte or two,  we do have media players of 
our own, y'know."

Cop #1:- (Slowly and sarcastically, to give his words extra emphasis.)
"But it isn't on, it's not a Pee-Cee!"

Cop #2:- "Victor Charlie to base... Victor Charlie, come in base..."
(Furiously shakes handset.)
"Bloody Windows CE two-way radio edition!"

Eventually, he gets through.

Cop #2:- "Ah base,  Victor Charlie here...  We've got a right one here, 
PC  case,  but  no PC in it,  there's a grey plastic wedge case  called 
'Falcon',  and  then  this  thing  called a 'Desktopper',  says  it  is 
'Powered by Centek?'"

(Excited  sounding static crackle from base,  they really could do with 
better atmospheric conditions!)

Cop  #2:-"Oh,  this is the best bit,  none of it runs anything remotely 
'Windows' related! Can't be possible, can it?"

(More crackling from the other end follows...)

Cop  #2:-  "Whaddya mean we can't 'do' him for anything?  So this is  a 
waste of a good bust then!?" (Exclaims) "BOLLOCKS!" 

Cop #2 to CiH:- "Well,  apparently you've broken no laws,  we can't get 
you  for  owning  and using a non-Windows based computer,  not  yet  at 
least. But mark my words old son, we'll be watching you  very  closely!!"

The frustrated cops walk back outside to their van.  When the third man 
gets  in  the back of the Transit,  it is just visible that  the  large 
obstentatious  revolving  satellite dish on the top  is  controlled  by 
someone in the back, turning a large crank handle, before the back door 
is hastily closed.

They speed off in a cloud of dust and frustration.
