                                By Cobra
 
This  was one of the bravest demo entries to come out of the  Error  in 
Line  party.  Note,  not  the strangest from that party,  but definitely 
marks out of ten for sheer courage in attempting what they did.

Boot  up  and wait awhile.  About the sort of time that you think  your 
Falcon has crashed and you are reaching for the reset button, something 
stirs onscreen.  A few quick title graphics,  in time with the haunting 
angel chorus music.
     
The main demo starts quietly enough with a texture-tunnel beloved of so 
many Dead Hackers productions. A nice texture is thrown into the mix by 
Agent T, it is smooth enough, nothing exceptional.

It's  then the GIANT SPINY BALL time with the proper title credits  for 
the  demo.  This  is  a very slow but huge and gorgeously  coloured  3D 
object, with various skilfully done credits overlaying it. The style is 
not so much like a normal ST or Falcon demo, as we've become accustomed 
to, but instead it is a lot more like a current PC or Amiga demo. "Like 
an MTV Video", as someone might have once said.

Yes,  there is a 3D virtual world engine in there.  It is also plodding 
on a 16 mhz '030 processor.  Surely it would rock on a Power PC Falcon? 
But we have to make do with what is available.

The virtual world engine reaches a climax with the 'flowerscape' scene, 
a  segment of landscape with the central feature of a beautifully  done 
plant  or  flower  in amongst an array of abstract 3D  objects.  It  is 
pushing  around 1300 polygons and assorted textures around.  That would 
be a breeze if this was a Dreamcast,  but this is a humble 16 mhz chip, 
and that is shown in the (lack of) speed here.  Still, it is refreshing 
to see something a sight more artistic than the usual parade of  single 
object based scenarios.
 
There  are  a  number  of single object screens,  and  this  engine  is 
noticeably under a lot less strain then. 

There  is also a very nice static graphic,  and whirly effect revealing 
it, well done to GFX man Orbital!

The other set-piece climax,  at a 'mere' 600 polygons or faces,  is the 
'hands'  scene,  with  hands  reflecting  into an  infinite  series  of 
mirrors.  Like  the  'flowerscape' scene before,  another 3D world that 
reflects a lot more imagination than most stock 3D design attempts.

A final single object, a bendy torus thing, then the demo dumps us back 
out  onto  the desktop,  a failing remembered from their previous  demo 
'Generation  Gap' released at the beginning of the year.  An endscreen, 
no matter how humble, would have been ever so welcome.

The music was a departure from normal practice, a very long sample file 
converted  from an .XM module,  for lack of a decent .XM player on  the 
Falcon,  we are told. This is almost certainly the reason why this demo 
is a memory-ravenous 14 meg grabber.

I  did  also  run  this under the extra  performance  afforded  by  the 
Centurbo  2  accelerator.  This  demo ran perfectly,  even on a 100  hz 
capable VGA monitor. A plus point for an RGB only demo! The improvement 
was  very noticeable,  if not fantastic,  for the update rate on the 3D 
world.  The frame rate was running something in excess on one frame per 
second  on the more complex scenes,  and approaching respectability  on 
the  lesser screens.  No use had been made of the DSP for updating,  or 
the  FastRAM  in  the accelerator.  It is interesting  to  compare  and 
contrast the 3D engine in this demo, with Tat's work on a comprehensive 
3D world engine for the discontinued 'Binliner' demo.

If  Cobra  do  start making use of the DSP,  or  better  optimising  of 
accelerator-friendly   features   such  as  FastRAM  for   their   next 
production,  then  some wicked kick-ass proper 3D scenes are just about 
within reach! Go for it, and good luck!
 
Before I forget, ENDSCREEN NEXT TIME PLEASE!

As I said at the start of this review, marks out of ten for courage!
 
Ratings..

Effects:-  80% -  Higher marks for better imagination and artistry  than 
usual. Let down a bit by slow implementation.
 
Graphics:-  85%  -  Extremely cool 'in da house'  static  graphics,  and 
tasteful 3D objects.
 
Music:- 83% -  Haunting and beautiful tune,  anyone got the original .XM 
file?
 
Overall:- 80%  - Better with an accelerator really.
