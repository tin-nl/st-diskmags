 
                 ˆLORD OF THE RINGS - THE TRILOGY
 

By now,  many of you who are online will have heard about the new 
Lord  of  the Rings movies,  which started filming  over  in  New 
Zealand a few weeks ago.

Since  the  announcement  was made  last  August,  work  on  pre- 
production  and  casting continued at a fair pace.  Most  of  the 
characters in the movie are now cast,  with the exception of  one 
two others who are still yet to be cast in the role.

For those of you who don't know or haven't heard the news on  the 
casting,  a  wide  variety of actors and actresses  from  various 
countries have accepted roles in the movies. The US actor, Elijah 
Wood,  plays the role of Frodo,  along with Sir Ian McKellen, who 
plays Bilbo.  I don't remember who has been cast for the roles of 
Merry  and Pippin,  but there has already been a change with  the 
casting  of  Aragorn.  Originally being played by a  British  guy 
called  Stuart Townsend,  he has been dropped for  an  Australian 
actor  called Viggo Mortensen.  At this stage,  I don't  know  if 
Viggo has signed up for the role of Aragorn or not,  this will be 
confirmed soon at the website, www.tolkien-movies.com .

Brad  Dourif,  who  is famous for the voice  role  of  everyone's 
favourite killer doll, Chucky, plays the part of Wormtongue. Even 
though  he  has not as yet been cast as a  character,  there  are 
still  very  strong hints that Sean Connery will be  involved  at 
some  stage with the LOTR movies,  in quite what role I  have  no 
idea.

Directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste,  The Frighteners), this new 
version  of J.R.R Tolkien's classic story,  set in Middle  Earth, 
will  be  a  live action version of the story.  At  the  time  of 
writing,  some of the early key first scenes have been completed, 
such as the time when the hobbits have set out from Hobbiton  and 
meet up with the first Black Rider. Pictures have been seen, once 
again on the website, of the set which will be used for Bree.

During a recent talk on his official site,  Rutger Hauer admitted 
that  he  had been in talks with the casting  director  of  LOTR. 
Apparently  they  have  him up for the role  of  Anborn,  one  of 
Faramir's aides in the book. He hasn't decided whether to take it 
as yet,  but he is clearly impressed by the character.  We  await 
Rutger's decision in due course.
