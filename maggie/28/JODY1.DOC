 
Chris,

Bloody pissy emulators.   I've spent hours trying to get it to work and 
all  it  does is crash out after thirty seconds of working.   It  looks 
quite convincing, the demo's I've got, but I only get to see a chunk of 
'em before it screws.

I've  had  to  manually  reset my PC  so  many  times,  it'll  probably 
permanently screw Windows soon, so I'm giving up until someone comes up 
with something amazing that works.

No-one's recieving my email's today. They keep coming back with vicious 
postmaster letters. Hopefully this one will get through before my daily 
limit expires.

Phatt One this weekend.  Another one of our big parties.  I'm getting a 
bit  of a reputation as the Party Drunk.  People have been saying to me 
"Are  you  getting hammered on Saturday?  Go on,  I really like it when 
you're drunk," and that kind of thing. Last Sunday's barbeque was a bit 
of a showcase:

It was in aid of four people's birthdays, happening on various days all 
this week, and the weather was great for outdoor food and drinking. Our 
house  joined the house of Silje,  Erika,  Mel & Sarah (the pioneers of 
the  cheese  and wine party saga,  I may have previously mentioned)  at 
about  2pm and we relaxed,  drinking vodka cocktails and cans of Stella 
Artois.

Other people arrived and we started on the barbeque food and I had  had 
a lot of coctails and several cans of lager before deciding to get  the 
wine out.  I bought the stuff expecting to share it,  but everyone else 
was  well into there own drinks,  so I had the bottle to myself,  along 
with  five  cans of Miller,  a Stella and plenty of vodka,  leaving  me 
totally gone by the time the place had filled out at about seven or so.

I  said a few shocking things,  which turned into quotes for people who 
 remebered  them the next few days after the party.  I thankfully didn't 
offend  anyone,  managed  to break a big Ikea glass by tripping over  a 
rake,  attempted picking a fight with a friend, saying "I don't want to 
start anything,  so you hit me first and I'll then kick the shit out of 
you,"  and ended up rapping with a chap called Tony to an  audience  in 
the kitchen.

At  half midnight three of us decided to depart,  as we had been  there 
since  2pm and it was getting cold out.  Girl Sam asked if we wanted  a 
lift in her car,  to which housemate, Jo, said yes. I however told them 
I wanted to be out in the fresh air and would beat them to our house on 
foot, before running off through the streets of Aldershot to our house.  
I beat them by a long way, surprisingly.

I'm  still  hearing stories of things I don't remember,  and  may  well 
drink  a little easier this weekend to embrace a bit of atmosphere  for 
my memorybanks, instead of making too much of an impact again.

We've  got a bit of a monster week ahead at the mo'.  Us Velvet  people 
are off on a mega pub-crawl on Wednesday,  to be written into a Fresher 
article  for  September's  issue,  while Thursday we're  going  to  The 
Ministry of Sound.  Then there's another party on Saturday,  though I'm 
not  expecting big things from it,  because by the time we got to their 
last party in January, the hosts were so smashed there was no life left 
in the place.

Anyway,  I  am  off  now.  Fuck.  More mail's just returned.  DAMN YOU, 
POSTMASTER. DAMN YOU AND YOUR STINKING UNIFORM. Bye.

CHRIS I AM ILL,

I'm  feeling terrible today and wish I was still in bed or  bathing  or 
something.  I went out last night and somehow got really stupidly drunk 
after  guzzling some heinous Belgium cocktail and then drinking far  to 
 many vodka and Redbulls.

I  fell  over twice and am now sporting bruises all over  my  legs,  my 
elbows  hurt whenever I lean on them and I have severe memory block.  I 
went  to see Alex P DJing and that bloke who was the lead  singer  with 
the  Inspiral Carpets in his new band - Clint Boon,  that's it.  In the 
end I didn't see any of it and just ended up being rowdy and talking  a 
lot to anyone I bumped into.

Some bloke attempted getting into a fight with me too,  as I nicked his 
friend's  chair despite the fact no-one was sitting on it and I said  I 
would  give  it back when his friend returned.  Security came over  and 
chucked the guy out though.

This morning I was still feeling the effects of alcohol and stepped off 
the bus only to fall into a stationary car, setting it's alarm off.

I've only been back a week and I'm getting a reputation already.

I  had to be in at 10am this morning to enrol for my third year,  so  I 
didn't get much sleep after getting to bed about 4am and then having to 
commute in this morning.

I  think  I'll  have  a quiet night in tonight  and  watch  a  film  or 
something,  even  though  people are planning to go out for a drink  to 
celebrate Mel getting back tonight. Certainly not for me.

Anyway, have a nice weekend and god I feel tired.
