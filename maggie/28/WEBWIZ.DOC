                                (v3.10)

                          by Cadenza Software

I  picked up this one at the recent Stafford Atari Show,  as I  thought 
that  'doing'  HTML and web pages might come in useful at  some  point, 
when I start to get ideas for a web site. 

Well, one day....

Until  that happens though,  a little play-around with what is on offer 
might come in useful, so that is what I did.

Matthew Bacon,  the main programmer behind Web Wizard,  set out to make 
construction  of web pages as easy as possible to the uninitiated,  the 
person  who  has no prior experience of HTML at all.  In  its  simplest 
form,  Web  Wizard  sets  out  to automate,  as much as  possible,  the 
 production of reasonable quality web pages.

The package comes on three disks,  which can be copied onto hard drive, 
or  backed  up onto other floppies,  if you are still running a  floppy 
only system. System requirements aren't over-demanding. Even a half-meg 
machine  can  be  used.  The  only  provisio is a  640  x  400  minimum 
resolution display. Of course, the more kit you've got, the better this 
package is to use. 

There  is  quite a lot of material for the three disks,  including  the 
main   page   constructor   program,   frame  and   table   constructor 
applications, assorted tools, a good many examples, and a comprehensive 
tutorial  for when you are ready to learn what those funny little  tags 
and things that make up HTML actually mean. For a show special price of 
10 ukp, this is already looking like good value for money.

No printed manual though,  but there are ascii, and hypertext documents 
for  the  instructions,  the  latter including  full  colour  graphical 
examples.  These  are generally helpful,  except where the operation of 
the program seems to depart a little bit from the instructions?

So,  we take the plunge and start to build a web page.  To do this,  we 
access  the  page builder proggie,  otherwise known as the 'wizard',  a 
carry-over from PeeCee jargon.

The  whole  process is taken step-by-step,  starting with the level  of 
expertise.  'Expert'  allows  you  pretty  much  total  access  to  the 
different  parts  of the program,  where 'novice' denies you access  to 
things  like defining an image file to go into the document.  You  will 
tend to discard the 'novice' setting very quickly.

Titles  are  a very serious business,  where you have to call your  web 
page something, and decide how big that 'something' is going to be, and 
how  it  is to be displayed.  There is an option to play an audio  MIDI 
file, if you want to.

Colours  are next,  select the right combination of text and background 
 colours. Swamp green on puke yellow, not good. Alternatively, dig out a 
handy background image to load in and tile over.

Headings and sub-headings,  make an impact,  shout to the world who you 
are, what you stand for!

The body text page is next,  this is a biggie, this needs a pre-written 
ascii text file, you have done one of those, haven't you?

Oh well, come back in a bit.....

Hello  again,  load in your pre-prepared text file,  choose from one or 
two columns,  left, right or centre justification, to retain the layout 
of  the text,  force carriage return or paragraph on empty line.  Well, 
 nearly  keep the layout of the text intact,  but we'll come back to that 
in a bit.

Another good bit next,  include an image within your page.  This can be 
anything JPG GIF,  or PNG (the last one only supported by CAB 2.8).  It 
can also be any size,  and allows you to set up an alternative textfile 
for  those  people  who run around with graphics  'off',  and  even  to 
specify a link from the image.

It is a little bit restrictive,  as it only allows the one image within 
the body of the page,  and that is always near the top of the document. 
To get multiple images on a page, you are going to have to get down and 
dirty  with  real HTML commands in a plain text editor.  To  a  certain 
extent, this applies to the package as a whole.

There is provision to put in links. These are displayed near the bottom 
of your Web Wizard created page,  and finally, there is the facility to 
put in name/email address, and date last updated/created.

There are also Table Wizard and Frame Wizard programs included with the 
package, and I openly admit to not having got as far as those as yet. A 
cursory examination suggests that it offers similar ease of use to  the 
main program.
 
The  other  major  component of Web Wizard,  is the  HTML  tutorial,  a 
complete A-Z,  both in hypertext format,  and with handy HTML examples. 
With  the rather pre-determined method of building pages in Web  Wizard 
itself,  it  is  clear  that  every encouragement  is  being  given  to 
encourage   the  user  to  experiment  further,   and  outside  of  the 
limitations of the program.

The  package  is well presented as a whole,  with one or two quirks  in 
operation, at least on my system? Web Wizard generates a 'wizard' file, 
or project file to go with your specimen HTML page, at least whilst you 
are constructing or updating it.  A handy feature, but one which seemed 
to  be  unwilling to load in,  unless I dragged and dropped the  wizard 
file  onto  the main proggy file.  Not a standard way of getting it  to 
work, I'm sure?

I  would find it a bit rigid in certain areas.  I've already  mentioned 
the 'one page, one image' rule a bit earlier. I also found it less than 
helpful when throwing textfiles at it.  You are unable, as far as I can 
tell,  to  keep  textfiles  exactly  as your  text  editor  left  them, 
especially if you like neat left  and  right hand justification.  You can 
get  good results from using the program,  but to really customise your 
web page to its utmost, you are staring at the HTML A - Z again.

The  good news is that this program is still being actively  developed, 
and new versions, including a WYSIWYG 'on the fly' HTML page generator, 
are in the works. At the moment, under single TOS, you have to exit the 
main program,  load up a web browser,  to check the end result. It is a 
bit  easier  with a multi-tasking O/S.  It would also be nice to get  a 
little bit more flexibility in certain areas, and an option to leave an 
ASCII text in the layout it came in,  is a number one priority.  (Or at 
least,  to  be  able  to totally ignore the justification  option  from 
within the program?)

Web  Wizard  is a good 'starter pack' for generating  web  pages,  some 
competent results can be obtained from it,  but you are soon looking at 
manual  HTML  editing  to go further  than  the  strictly  standardised 
 layouts. This is where the tutorial material comes in useful though!
 
 Advantages..
Easy to understand interface.
Can get worthwhile results quickly, if you accept format limitations.
Masses of supplementary material, tutorials etc.
Includes frame and table making programs.
Actively being developed.
Good value for money.
The author (Matthew Bacon) is a genuinely nice bloke!
(Errm, does this last one count? - Ed) 

 Disadvantages..
Quirky operation in one or two places.
Textfile handling a case of over-nannying?
One page, one image.
And one set of links.
All in the same place each time.
Soon have to manually HTML edit to break out of limitations above.
