With  the  company  long gone,  Atari machines have been reduced  to  a 
plaything  for  fanatics.   It was not long ago that Apple's  computers 
were  destined  to  a  similar fate in  the  monopolised  PC  world  of 
Microsoft/Intel.   With  the iMac and suitably colourful G3's still  in 
demand,  Jody  Smith  takes a bite of the Apple and reflects back on  a 
year of Macintosh.

 
I  REMEMBER the scene as depicted in The Guardian last summer.   Hoards 
of  people  lining up outside a London computer  store  before  opening 
time,  waiting  to purchase the first few release copies of Windows 98.  
It was not the intense motivation of the people queuing for the  shop's 
midnight opening that stuck in my mind, but the people themselves. 

Nobody  appeared  to be talking.   No one was hinting on so much  as  a 
smile,  or  looked  at all eager at the thought of receiving the  brand 
new/slightly  souped-up  PC  operating system (or  O/S).   People  were 
hunched,  grey and solitary,  resembling a Soviet Union bread queue. At 
midnight,  they  marched  in,  plucked their copies of Windows 98  from 
shelves hung with banners, paid their money and went home.  This was by 
no means a PC community,  but a fellowship of people who were to return 
home  and  communicate  with  people  using  Microsoft's  new  internet 
interface.  The iMac launch could not be more different.

Trendy  young  designers,  hippies and teenage girls who probably  have 
their  own websites hyperlinked to their fathers businesses,  queued up 
for the UK launch, chatting and joking in a way that reminded me of the 
day  Sega  named Sonic 2sday.   At midnight some years ago I  joined  a 
Megadrive  owning friend to buy the hedgehog's second  console  outing, 
getting  the  cart  home in time to beat the game and wrap  it  up  for 
somebody else's Christmas present long before the store opened again at 
9am  that  morning.  iMac's  disappeared quickly in the  hands  of  the 
enthusiastic public and before long blue, purple, orange, green and red 
bubbles  had  appeared in homes across the country.   One  thing's  for 
sure:  these kids were the envy of their friends right up until Siemens 
released their C25 mobile phone with programmable ringing tones. 

Perhaps  it  is  shallow to say Apple has reduced itself  to  simply  a 
spinner of fads and maybe it is more appropriate to call the company an 
innovator  under  the same terms they have  been  previously  regarded.  
Though  to openly analyse the iMac one must not degenerate  into  petty 
computer  bitching:  "The  iMac's pretty and easy to use,  but it can't 
keep up with the average PC," writes Jim McCauley,  shakily replying to 
a  letter  received from a Mac fan in PC Format's  January  issue  this 
year.   "And  yes,  our  mags are laid out on Macs,  because that's how 
Future  started  out  in the days before the PC  overtook  the  Mac  in 
performance terms and before Quark and Photoshop were available on  the 
PC." It is this paranoid computer snobbery that has always bothered me.  
At  High  School I would jibe at my friend's Amiga,  and the  machine's 
lack of Midi ports.  

Today  I  own a high-end Pentium PC for all my  journalism,  games  and 
multimedia,  while  a G3 copes with any graphic design work I do and my 
ST remains locked up until I feel the urge to play Populous 2,  or some 
tracker  modules.  I  consider myself to have an unbiased view  of  all 
formats and know that no matter how many graphic cards you stuff into a 
PC  it will never run Quark as naturally as a Macintosh and  that  Word 
just  does not feel 'right' working on any other system other than  PC.  

Yet more paranoid suggestions of constant crashing are also a thing  of 
the past now that Intel have everything under control,  bless 'em.  One 
cannot help wish good things for Macintosh however,  as it was them who 
observed the wholesale rip-off of their own O/S through Windows, but is 
the iMac just a pretty face?

It  is  about time the criminally recognisable beige box  of  the  home 
computer  was  replaced by something a tad more stylish  and  the  iMac 
achieves  transparency  without resembling a  future  space-age  vision 
summed up by those horrendous neon eighties bars, but instead something 
even more handsomely nineties than Buffalo boots and Gap Khakis. 

Even  the  circuit boards - visible through the iMac's  plastic  -  are 
designed   to   be  appear  more  attractive.    Behind  the   complete 
monitor/computer  unit  there  is  only  one  power  cable,  a  telecom 
connection and a USB port for printers and other peripherals. Simple by 
design,  but  that - if anywhere - is exactly where the iMac's  problem 
lies.   With  so little scope for expansion,  the iMac has no chance of 
being futureproof,  with no room internally for upgrades and not even a 
floppy  drive  to  be  found on the machine.   The  only  way  to  save 
information  outside  the hard-drive is to use a Zip disk  -  fine  for 
large  picture files,  though rather silly if moving small or even very 
large text documents about. 

It is all very well opting for newer technology in the form of Zip - it 
is  after  all the only way technology progresses - but  the  universal 
standard  of  a  floppy's  low cost and  disposability  will  never  be 
surpassed. 

Then  there is the operating system.   The Mac O/S is renowned for it's 
user  friendliness,  though now Microsoft have done us all a favour and 
ripped it off,  what can it offer us?  The Mac O/S has not been updated 
in over five years and it's poor memory management schemes and sluggish 
disk  access - not to mention lack of disk eject buttons -  causes  the 
system to look dated. 

If  Apple  had paid more attention to the  iMac's  operating  software, 
instead of just it's snazzy looks, then perhaps the fact that consumers 
were  paying  œ1,300  for  an oversized  boiled  sweet  would  be  more 
justified.   Though  I  generally  appraise the  iMac's  mould-breaking 
looks,  when  it comes to using the machine over a long period of  time 
one realises how clumsy it is to use. 

The  keyboard,  although  chunkily transparent and handsome,  is not  a 
touch  on  traditional  Mac  keyboards,  with the  scope  for  keyboard 
shortcuts  limited by the iKeyboard's odd feel.   The circular mouse is 
also  a problem,  with its design not immediately instigating which way 
is  up  and  Mr  Macintosh,  please take note:  hands  are  not  round.  
Otherwise  we would be cutting our food with bubble-shaped  knives  and 
wearing gloves fashioned like pancakes.

Above all, Apple is not marketing a computer that will be of any use to 
a  serious  user.   They are aiming the thing at the kids and what  the 
kids want is Internet access and cool looks.   The iMac ads say nothing 
of  hardware  speed  or what the machine can  actually  do.   What  the 
company not only wants but needs to do is make a quick buck and grab  a 
young  consumer base before they know anything of O/S  flexibility  and 
expansion.   And more than anything else, they need to grab this custom 
before  it reaches the world of PC - a lifelong point of no return  for 
most users. 

Admittedly  I would trade all my beige box computer hardware in  for  a 
machine as sexily hip to look at as the iMac,  but with so little scope 
for  expansion  and with PC's running internet facilities  at  a  lower 
starter  price (and not to mention free access not offered  by  Apple's 
partner,  Earthlink),  there is no real reason to want to shell out for 
an iMac.  Thankfully, the new G3's are equipped with snazzier software, 
easy  hardware  expansion,  hyper-funky monitors and,  alas,  more round 
mice and playskool keyboards.
