Everybody's  in the place,  Less Cow.   It has been some time since the 
day  I walked my way down the isle beside the sea,  beside the seaside, 
see?  My Phoney zone has been away from the girl, like, Maggie for over 
a year,  but now it's back in black, never slack, what's that? Big rat? 
No cat? I like that, ratta-tat-tat.

Less fat.   Less shit.   Full vibe.  But what have I been doing since I 
last  sat in my hive?   I've been here and there,  shaking hands at the 
girls  and  fists to the women,  bullets to the boys and  poppin'  'em, 
like,  in  and  cappin' 'em off.   Wood,  not East,  I gunned the beast, 
right?

For those not strictly in with the phoning,  like a virgin up the spout 
I'm gonna tell you it straight:  I call a fool and make him a fool, not 
just  'Hey  fool' but make him look a fool,  like a fool without  food, 
with  egg  on his face.   This time I call a chap named Pete:  Apostle? 
Wait - not him - another Pete.   Runs a club, like what you don't wanna 
be seen hitting seals with.  Solitary brother?  The little bugger.

Changes.   Where have I bin?   A little history since being away?  I'll 
tell you what, Scot: I went a bit loony, just like George Clooney, room 
with  a  voomey,  over  in America,  with those Americans,  those young 
Americans, all right?  While there I rose to the top, like the cream of 
the  crop,  I  never eat a pig 'cos a pig is a cop.   But I came to get 
down  and  ended up on the floor of the NY scene,  with my  friends  in 
their  café and their hair and their smiles like quids.   Before long I 
left  for  The  Fear and gambled my soul in a shark  of  blood,  before 
ending up on a beach with the girls in the grass.  Smoking.

Now  I'm  back on the scene - get on up - and with no  plans  to  leave 
England  for a while as yet.   That foggy town of London is a red bus I 
will stay on.

That's a memoir that has gone too far,  so on to the guts.   Here is my 
conversation,  word-for-word  with the man who runs a club about ET and 
sightings in the sky and yes Stew,  it's true - and if you want to have 
it  up  about that then I'll be a legless man,  running a race with  no 
beer.   Getcha?  So  here  it  is,  Blue  Monkey,  all the time on  the 
telephone line, read and learn.


Close Encounters Club, Suffolk.  Tel: 01473 450164

[phone rings, gets picked up by 40-something woman] 
Woman: Hello? 
Blue: Hello, I wish to speak with your leader. 
Woman: Sorry? 
Blue: The sci-fi one.  The one with the knowledge of ET. 
Woman: Is this about the Close Encounters Club? 
Blue: Affirmative. 
Woman: Well you could be more polite about it. 
Blue: I am sorry.  I am not fully accustomed to your traditions. 
[Woman  doesn't  answer.   Puts  phone aside and is heard  shouting  to 
someone, possibly 'leader'] 
Pete: Hello? 
Blue: Hello. 
[silent pause] 
Pete: How can I help? 
Blue: Are you the leader? 
Pete: Yes, I'm the chap who runs the Close Encounters Club.  Been doing 
it for, oh, five years now. 
[silence] 
Pete: My name's Pete.  Is it that you'd like to join? 
Blue: I have had an encounter. Pete: What was that? 
Blue:  I have had an encounter and I wish to join.  
Pete: Really? 
Blue: Yes really, I have had an encounter. 
Pete:  Well,  club  meetings are once a month if you'd like to join and 
share your experience. 
Blue:  What I have experienced cannot be shared.  
Pete:  No?   I  thought  that's why you were calling,  so that you could 
come  and  tell us about it and hear about our  own  encounters.   They 
don't  just have to be about extra terrestrial life - people  come  and 
tell us about their supernatural experiences as well.   There are a lot 
of  good  ghost stories in East Anglia and plenty of  UFO  sightings  - 
especially  round the air bases and forest areas.   You know,  a lot of 
people  come to us after they've been out and walked their dog  on  the 
same route they always use every day, but on one occasion they say they 
see strange lights in the sky, or [chuckles] other things like that. 
Blue: Oh, I understand. 
Pete:  What  was  your experience?   You don't have to tell everyone if 
you're  not  used  to  talking  to groups of  people  -  we  publish  a 
newsletter  once in a while and have stories written in there and  even 
have people come and present stories from other talk groups around  the 
country. 
Blue: Have you an encounter? 
Pete: What was that. 
Blue: An encounter; have you? 
Pete: Sorry?  Have I, ah, had an encounter, are you saying? 
Blue: Yes, an encounter of yours I am saying. 
Pete:  Yes,  I've  had  an encounter - it wasn't a close one.   To be a 
close  encounter,  you have to come into contact with extra terrestrial 
life forms.  We haven't had many who've been in those boots, I can tell 
you. 
Blue: I have had a close encounter. 
Pete: Have you?  Was it round here? 
Blue: No, it was down below. 
Pete: In Australia? 
Blue: They take sperm.  The aliens. 
Pete: Spawn? 
Blue: Sperm.  Seamen.  Willy milk.  If you will. 
Pete: I'm sorry? 

Blue:  It  was only a week ago - I can still feel the chaffing.   I was 
out  walking  my  dog  in the soft moonlight,  among the  flow  of  the 
woodland grasses and the dance of the night tree shadows.  My attention 
lay  somewhere between the silhouettes of mother nature's form and  the 
gentle  caress  of  the  wind  as it took  tendril  hold  of  my  hand, 
clenching, stroking as I gripped the dog's lead. [long pause] 
Pete: Hello? 
Blue: Yes. 
Pete: Sorry I just remembered I haven't asked your name? 
Blue: My name is not important. 
Pete: Is that... Sorry, I think it is.  If you don't mind me asking? 
Blue:  It  was  a pleasant walk,  a silent walk,  though of course that 
cannot  really  be,  as nothing is truly silent.   The darkness on  the 
inside of one's eyelids may be termed pure black,  though nothing is as 
truly  black  as the hole that exists in the souls  of  all  ourselves, 
throughout our lives of hardship and hatred.   But silent it was, aside 
from  the  sway of the woodland grasses,  the dance of the  night  tree 
shadows and the gentle caress of the wind as it took tendril hold  upon 
my flesh. 
Pete:  My,  that's very poetic.   Is that when something happened?   It 
wasn't  in Leiston was it?   A lot of thing's happen in the woods  near 
there? 
Blue:  It  was  still.   It  was warm,  but then so very cold.   My dog, 
Cranthorn,  could sense something.   He was once a hunting dog, but now 
retired  to nothing but a life of food,  sleep and bone-deep pain where 
gunshot once struck.  A stray bullet, like the sudden gust of wind that 
took me that night, blowing my scarf tighter round my neck.  We turned, 
we ventured, we went home.  Cranthorn returned to a bowl of water, I to 
a glass of hot Ribena laced with brandy - a strange yet exuberant  mix.  
I then slept to the sound of Cranthorn's god-forsaken barking. 
[silence] 
Pete: Then what happened? 
Blue:  Oh,  nothing much.   I had a goodnight's sleep and got up in the 
morning about seven. 
Pete: But what about the dog barking? 
Blue: He always barks at night. 
Pete: Didn't you experience any extra terrestrial life? 
Blue: No, I just went for a walk, came home, slept. 
Pete: But you said you had a close encounter? 
Blue: Yes, that was the other week. 
Pete: Well what happened?  Were you walking the dog? 
Blue: No, I was out in the car. 
Pete: Want to tell me what happened? 
Blue:  Radio went berserk.  Engine stopped working.  Stepped out of the 
car, got buggered senseless by an alien with the voice of Dr Fox. 
Pete: What was that?  Can I write it down? 
Blue:  If  you  like:  My car just died,  the radio was crazy and when I 
stepped out of the car Dr Fox ripped my trousers off with some kind  of 
tractor beam and pummelled my buttocks.   It's gross I know,  but these 
things happen.   Not very often by all means, but they happened all the 
same. Pete: Who did this? 
Blue:  An alien.   Wore a Nike baseball cap, jacket and jeans and spoke 
like  a  local disk jockey.   His caress was nothing as gentle  as  the 
wind's, I can tell you. 
Pete: I'm sorry, I don't follow.  What did it do? 
Blue: [trying not to laugh] It slipped me a fat one. 
Pete:  Pardon?   I don't understand this at all.  Was this a real alien 
encounter? 
Blue: Beats me.  I can't think of one closer, though. 
Pete:  Did this happen outside your car?   The being didn't try to make 
contact before? 
Blue: No.  Rather rude really. 
Pete: But you didn't go unconscious? 
Blue: No, I was awake at the time. 
Pete: And you were outside your car? 
Blue: Have you ever heard of wit? 
Pete: Have I ever heard of what? 
Blue: Doesn't matter. 
Pete: Um... You'll have to come to one of our sessions and explain your 
story again. 
Blue: Alright. 
Pete: Tell me once again what happened when you got out of the car? 
Blue: I put my hands on the roof and gritted my teeth. 
Pete: Why? 
Blue: Seemed like the only decent thing to do at the time. 
Pete: Why? 
Blue: Don't know really. 
[pause] 
Pete: Then what happened? 
Blue: He used a tractor beam. 
Pete: From his spaceship? 
Blue: No, the beam came directly from his ring. 
Pete: His ring? 
Blue: Don't remind me. 
Pete: Remind you of what? 
Blue: Forgotten. 
Pete: Pardon? 
Blue: I feel this conversation is going round in circles. 
Pete: Why do you say that? 
Blue: I feel this conversation is going round in circles. 
Pete: But why do you say that? 
Blue: I feel this conversation is going round in circles. 
Pete: Yes, but why do you keep saying that? 
Blue: I feel this conversation is going round in circles. 
Pete: What can I do? 
Blue:  I  feel  this seat is going to be the death of me...  Oh,  that's 
better. 
Pete: What's happened? 
Blue: Bloody thongs... Oh, nothing. 
Pete: What I suggest you do - and please may I ask your name again? 
Blue: Yes. 
[pause] 
Pete: Would you like to tell me your name? 
Blue: Okay.  [pauses]  Jessica. 
Pete: Sorry - it's Jessica? 
Blue: Anything wrong with that? 
Pete:  Oh no sorry, I just haven't heard many - I know it's silly - but 
I  haven't heard of many men called Jessica,  that's all.   Though I've 
known a fella called Jess, so I suppose that makes sense. 
Blue: I feel this conversation is going round in circles. 
Pete: Is it? 
Blue: Do you ever wish you could just hang up on someone? 
Pete: Well... 
Blue: And I don't mean offence, but [hangs up]. 
[account ends]



F a d e  t o   B l u e ...

That was the end of that,  with no more sense at play,  I quit the talk 
by slamming the handset.   Pete was calm,  though loved to yapper and I 
would have cut out his tongue and fed it to the plants if I'd have been 
with  his  wife.   Too  many  freakin' idiots have left  the  man  with 
stability  like  a lamppost and even a buggering Fox didn't  shake  the 
clay. 

Pity his wife, who puts up with his life and suffers through strife and 
festivals  with  men like heads like pasties.   Clingin'.  This is  it.  
Expect me back before long, with nothing like that American parade next 
time  and  no absence to mention,  'cos money's too tight,  all  right?  
Keep  it  real,  I will continue,  all the time on the telephone  line.  
Betcha  arse  currency.  Until then:  "Don't go breaking my heart."  "I 
won't, I'll break your neck, fatty."

Yessir.

attempt  to  register  Blue  Monkey  under  the  circular  patents  and 
copyrights  rota  of a well-known newsgroup Jody Smith happened  to  be 
working for at the time,  got him into a lot of trouble.  It is however 
a  shame  when  people rip him off though,  like  a  non-Atari  website 
someone  once alerted me of,  not only using a picture of Blue  Monkey, 
but  also doing a piss-poor impersonation of him.   Blue Monkey happily 
appears  in  games,  demos  and other software products  upon  request.
