
                         ‰Odds and Sods from EIL
 
         The demos and intros that are small enough to go in here
                  in a sort of tidying-up things way.

 This  little  textfile is designed to soak up all those  awkward  gravy 
stain efforts,  the kind of thing that really would be over too quickly 
to get a whole article to itself. In this spirit though, we salute you.


  'F6 Part 2' by Cream.. 

In  spite of the fake demo inspired title,  this is more of an out-take 
from  a future production,  which didn't quite come off in time for the 
Error in Line party.

Take  a short humourous animation and convert it from the  PeeCee,  and 
you  get  something best described as the ideal visuals for  the  'B-B-
Bittner rap', which featured a certain bodily function very loudly!

So,  if a figurine chucking up endlessly into a toilet,  rendered in ST 
lo-res  blockyvision in an interestingly gritty,  but polished way,  is 
your kind of thing, then get this right away!
 
 Rating:- 85% - 'Heftig', the finished demo, will be the killer queen
                 on the ST, when it eventually gets out!

 
  'ASCII Torus', by Dejam.. 

Another  (imaginary) scene at Error in Line.  A tired but happy  Defjam 
hands  in  his  competition-busting  ST  megademo  entry,   crying  out 
"Finished  (49%)!" Whilst awaiting the start of the main  competitions, 
he  feels at a loose end,  and fancies having a go at something  really 
odd, just to wind down.

The   'something  really  odd'  that  emerges  from  Dejam's   creative 
processes,  a  couple  of  hours  later,  is a 3D  spinning  torus,  or 
doughnut,  but one 'done' in ASCII characters!  There hasn't been a big 
history of live ASCII demo efects,  as opposed to static ASCII art, but 
I  remember  an  early effort given away with one of  the  Delta  Force 
issues of Maggie.

This was a 'cube', with 'wicked cowbell' system key-bell sound effects, 
and  was probably involving something very cunning to do with ASCII  or 
ANSI key commands on a textfile.  Defjam's demo,  looks a lot more like 
proper coding though.

The  fact  that it was done on ST Survivors French  keyboarded  ST,  is 
perhaps the least remarkable aspect of it.
 
 Rating:- 80% - Who is going to be mad enough to do the first full
                ASCII Megademo then?
 

 'Songs of Distant Earth', by tSCc and Cream.. 

Just  a  small production from the surviving active part  of  tSCc,  MC 
Laser, with the assistance of various parts of Cream, and Edo of Sector 
1.

This is a 'goodbye' intro,  on behalf of tSCc,  who have gone inactive, 
or PC,  to varying degrees. Hence the involvement of other Atarians, on 
MC Laser's behalf.  This was kicked out at Error in Line, and isn't too 
much,  apart  from  being  a nice showcase for some of MC  Laser's  SID 
effect  soundchip  tunes.  A couple of nice logos,  a planetscape still 
graphic, and a simple menu selector for the music. Understated, sombre, 
and  dignified.  The tunes do include the main demo tune for the DHS ST 
entry, 'Sweety'.

The  'Readme' text is something else,  really letting rip on the  ASCII 
production  values  and  Pink Floyd lyrics.  Whilst  not  decrying  the 
efforts of Cream and Edo,  this is probably the main visual interest in 
this little production.

So farewell, and thanks for all the fish, especially the Babelfish!

 'I See Stars' by Spion of Escape.. 

A  4ktro,  in  the  mould of small,  pleasant and unremarkable.  A  3-D 
starfield  starts  from  a side-on view,  then changes to a  'back  and 
forth' perspective.

It  could  quite happily remain that way for evermore,  at least  until 
pressing  the  spacebar produces one final surprise,  a  small  credits 
screen.  This  is described in self-depreciating terms as a first  time 
effort, so we'll put this down as a brave and reasonable effort.

 Rating:- 60% - We've seen stars, let's see what's next..  


 'Bye Bye-tro' by Checkpoint and Escape.. 

And  finally,  this neat effort from the combined forces of  Checkpoint 
and Escape, all done in a nice winding things down sort of way.

A  mixture of swirly hi-res vector line and sineous effects,  with  the 
odd hint of shade bob,  all reminiscent of something Synergy might have 
done,  back in '93.  Cutting into those,  are a sequence of unobtrusive 
thanks  and dedications for all the people involved in making Error  in 
Line happen.  Even seemingly minor players, such as the people who lent 
tables, or who were involved in the necessary but unglamourous business 
of  keeping  the  EIL attending hordes fed and watered.  They  are  all 
commemorated here.

And quite rightly so.

 Rating:- 70% - And it's thanks to them!
