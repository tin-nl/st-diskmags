  Craig  Charles talks to Jody Smith about the series,  the  show,  the 
sentence, the stand-up and the film.

(Written originally for 'Velvet' Magazine.)
  
"Who the fuck let the kid into the audience," Craig Charles said  after 
yet  another venue of his stand-up show where celebrities,  paedophiles 
and  even  Princess  Diana  get  a  slating.   Though  featuring  a  16 
certificate,  a lone Robot Wars-loving 11-year-old had been smuggled in 
by  his  parents,  witnessing  a breed of comedy so  far  removed  from 
children's TV programming it goes beyond description. 

"I  don't swear in front of my kids,  so why should I swear in front of 
someone  else's?  I couldn't let go - I had to do the clitoris gag:  Do 
you know what a clitoris is?" Craig asked the boy. "No, me neither." On 
stage he may have seemed drunk and disorderly, but back in his dressing 
room  he  struck a soberly pose.  Craig's tanked-up act reaped  success 
over  all  44 of the sell-out tour venues  stretching  across  Britain, 
basking in the liberation of intoxication. 

"I  tend to act pissed every night - it gives me the excuse if I  wanna 
really  go  over the top.  It's not my fault then,  it's the  alcohol," 
Craig  said,  Budweiser  in hand.  "I don't get worried about offending 
people  at  all.  Jokes are there to be told.  British comedians have a 
tradition of laughing at tragedy and my gags go down so bloody well and 
the reaction's so big, people just sop them up and don't give a shit." 

This  is  not his first time on the road either.  Long before this  and 
Craig's  1995 tour,  he was doing stand-up of a very different  nature. 
Prior  to  any  of  his TV work and before he  had  even  strayed  from 
Liverpool,  he  was  most famously known as Craig Charles,  Performance 
Poet.  "I used to stand there and do funny poetry anyway and in the end 
I just got bored and ended up writing gags," he recalls.  "I was always 
the  bright one at school,  though people didn't hate me just for that. 
Because I was the only black kid in a school of about 1,000 white kids, 
they hated me anyway." 

Craig  has  a  depth to him  beyond  his  Neanderthal,  curry-devouring 
characters.  He  claims it's his photographic memory that serves him so 
well  during  stand-up  and  says he can still  remember  his  O  Level 
revision  notes now.  He doesn't just remember the names of the remote-
controlled  drones featured in Robot Wars - if you asked him,  he could 
probably  tell  you  exactly how each one was built.  Though  at  first 
grimacing  when I mentioned the hit series,  Craig speaks of the multi-
thousand pound robots featured on the show with tremendous familiarity. 
What  is the big deal about cumbersome hunks of metal with hacksaws,  I 
put to him,  why not wrap yourself in tin foil and, carrying a pickaxe, 
enter yourself into the competition? 

"If you were a guy in a suit and you went up against Sir Killabot,  you 
would lose and you would lose in a very bloody,  tragic fashion," Craig 
put  on a sinister face.  "Sir Killabot is the best robot in the world. 
Sir Killabot is a fucking serious bit of robot.  The robotic arm on him 
is four times stronger than what the fire brigade use to cut people out 
of crashed cars. You wouldn't want that grabbing hold of your pecker." 

Oh, I don't know. Away from pecker-abuse, Craig revels in the fact that 
he writes all the show's masterful links. Links such as 'We don't stand 
for  fools and we don't like bores,  but we do get even on Robot Wars.' 
Will he ever run out of things to rhyme with 'wars'? 

"No.  I think the next one'll be 'If you had to, would you shag all The 
Corrs?'" he laughed,  referring to part of his stand-up routine.  "That 
is a brilliant gag: Come on, there's three beautiful women and that one 
fella.  If  you  had to shag all The Corrs,  would ya?  Because I know I 
fucking would." 

Then there is the trademark Robot Wars finger kiss,  which will go down 
in  history  alongside Nicky Campbell's Wheel of  Fortune  Wave,  Chris 
Tarrant's  Constipated Gaze and Michael Barrymore's Idiot  Legs.  Where 
did that one come from? 

"I  stole  it from Dr.  Destiny," he said,  glancing across to  Russell 
Bell,  Craig's tour manager and comic accomplice for 15 years.  "It was 
actually from The Funky Bunker on ITV.  And at the end of it,  what did 
you say?" Russell kissed his fingers and uttered smoothly, "Have a nice 
life." 

Ah  yes,  The  Funky Bunker.  Kind of TFI Friday with an ugly audience, 
aired at 1am Saturday morning and replacing The James Whale Show in the 
pointless midnight telly stakes.  Saying that,  it did hold 71 per cent 
of audience share at that time in the morning, therefore making it "the 
most  popular  late night television show ITV ever had and  my  company 
made it for eight grand an episode." 

Craig's company?  "The Smeg corporation.  The logo's great. It's like a 
big green blob." 

Craig's  presence  on  Robot  Wars has bumped  viewing  figures  up  by 
2.6million,  putting it alongside Red Dwarf at the top of BBC2's weekly 
ratings. Nice to see that Red Dwarf series eight received a reception a 
little better than that of the previous season, too. 

"Series seven was shot on film,  so everything was a lot more measured. 
We didn't have the adrenaline rush or the audience to make it work.  If 
we  had filmed some of the episodes of series seven in front of a  live 
audience they'd have been off the fucking roof. Series eight though, is 
the best one yet. The comedy has never been so good." 

There  was even a US Red Dwarf,  recalls Craig:  "They tried to make an 
episode  over there with an American cast,  but they only got  half-way 
through.  The guy who played me was a 6'3, blonde, blue-eyed sex god. I 
would  have  shagged him.  It wasn't Red Dwarf anyway - White Dwarf  we 
called it. Even the Cat was a white woman." 

Don't  suppose  curry  and lager jokes went down too  well  in  America 
either. A burger and lager beer doesn't quite have the same ring to it. 
One thing Craig does not miss when away from Red Dwarf are the  dreaded 
hair  extensions.  "This  series I refused to have them,  so they  just 
stitched  them in everyday,  but before I had to wear them for the full 
five months of filming." 

Away  from the limelight,  Craig does a lot of corporate videos.  He is 
indeed  the  face  of  BP,  Apple Mac and IBM.  When one of  the  three 
companies  releases  a new product,  he's the one presenting the  video 
introducing it to the marketing staff.  The video may not be on general 
release,  but he gets paid a fortune for it.  In 1993 he even presented 
an ITV Samaritans documentary on suicide. The main message there? "Lock 
the knife drawer," he quips. 

Among  all  the many ups,  it was only five years ago that one  serious 
downer  threatened to destroy the career of Craig Charles  forever.  In 
July  1994 the comic faced charges of raping an ex-girlfriend  and  was 
sent  to prison.  Five months later he was finally proven innocent  and 
released.  Locked  for 23 hours in his cell each day,  Craig spent time 
writing. 

"Looking  back  on  it,  I quite enjoyed the experience,"  he  laughed. 
"You've  gotta take good things out of it,  otherwise you just become a 
mess."  Luckily  for Craig,  his time in prison was spent with some  of 
Britain's finer convicts:  "I said, 'I'm not hanging around any rapists 
or child molesters, I wanna be in with the lads', so I ended up landing 
in with a load of bank robbers. I still get a few knocks on my door now 
and again and a few letters. They're good lads." 

Back  in  the  land  of showbiz,  Craig has a busy  year  ahead.  After 
following his UK tour up with some dates in America, Canada and Norway, 
International Robot Wars kicks off in July - "We take on the Americans. 
I  think  we'll  bash 'em." - and Red Dwarf The  Movie  starts  filming 
towards the end of the year.  As well as all the funny stuff,  Craig is 
forever searching for that serious role. 

"I'd  love  to  do more of it,  it's just getting offered the  part.  I 
enjoyed  doing  The  Governor.  It was the first  time  people  stopped 
shouting 'smeg head!' at me in the street and started shouting 'Eugene! 
Yaw a nutta you ar'!  Oi, nutta!' Which was infinitely more pleasurable 
than 'smeg head' when you think about it." 

Craig has been in television since the age of 17 - "I'm 34 now.  In dog 
years  I'm dead." - he's married,  has children and if his  soon-to-be-
released  fourth book fails to bring home yet more riches,  at least he 
has  a career flogging ideas to marketing staff.  Not bad going for the 
last human on Earth.

Craig Charles An Autobiography comes out later this year.
