
            ‰THE PHENIX, CENTEK, AND ALL THAT, AN ANNOUNCEMENT
  
This  announcement  was  not written by Centek but  by  Yann  Lossouarn 
lossouarn.yann@free.fr,  who  is independent from Centek and  contacted 
Rodolphe CZUBA by phone. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The  main piece of news in the Atari world this month  revolves  around 
Centek.  Rumors  are  spreading  over the web and on Usenet  about  the 
cancellation  of  the Phenix project and the launch of the  Phenix  260 
project. 

 It is urgent for Centek to publish an official statement. 

 Rodolphe  CZUBA,  who  was obviously affected by the recent events  has 
entrusted  me  with  the  writing  of  this  announcement  to  maintain 
neutrality in the description of events that are emotionally charged. I 
hope this choice will help avoid any controversy (unlike what  happened 
in the past) 
 
  History.. 
 
A  few months ago (April 99) Centek and Class4 announced their  merging 
to form a new company that would keep the name Class4. The goal of this 
operation  was to get easier financing to allow Centek's developers  to 
devote  their energy to the Phenix project and speed up the release  of 
this  long-awaited  machine. 

  Reasons for the cancellation of the Phenix project..
  
Reality  was  different.  Even though the development of  the  Phenix's 
hardware  was on track, it was not the case for "Dolmen", its operating 
system.  The  three developers responsible for writing Dolmen gradually 
chose  not  to  finish it and to spend more time  working  on  Class4's 
business  (laser shows).   Without these developers' work,  the project 
was in a critical situation,   which lead Rodolphe CZUBA to drop it (at 
least in its original form) 
 
  Centek goes out of business..

 The  search for the financing necessary to complete the integration  of 
Centek's  products was never completed,  or never started according  to 
Rodolphe,  and  therefore  the  merging was never effective.  With  the 
Phenix  project being phased out,  there is no reason for Centek to  go 
on.  Rodolphe  CZUBA and his former collaborators chose to close  their 
business. 

Some equipment belonging to the company will be put up for sale 
 
  Future or no future, that's the question.. 
 
The cut out of the Phenix project might leave some of you feeling  that 
the trust they had in Centek has been betrayed. 

First of all,  Rodolphe CZUBA has no intention of 'disappearing' and he 
will  support  the products he has developed such as the  CENTurbo  II. 
Falke  Verlag  in  Germany might soon produce  this  accelerating  card 
again,  under  a  licensing agreement.   

A  DSP  56301 + 20-Bit Audio (or better !) PCI card  derived  from  the 
Phenix could be created for the Milan. 

As  of the software that was developed,  there is a lot of  uncertainty 
about  its  future.  Will their authors support them?  Nothing is  more 
doubtful  as they seem to have become uninterested in the Atari  cause. 
It  could  be interesting if they would give them to the  community  so 
that  others  could  possibly follow up.   

You might think that this announcement is just a long list of bad news, 
don't you?  As strange as it may seem, I would say that it is the exact 
opposite. A very happy ending seems to be in reach.   

  ... and the answer is : future !!! 

I  would like to say that what is about to follow may seem  implausible 
to  many  even to the most credulous.  But I verified  the  information 
given  to  me by Rodolphe CZUBA the best I could and my  conclusion  is 
that  the  project  mentioned  in the  following  lines  is  absolutely 
serious.  In  the  past few months,  Rodolphe realized that the  Phenix 
project was taking a bad turn :  the enthusiasm of developers was going 
downward and the financing was late. 

Since  he  was  committed  to delivering the  Phenix  to  Atarists,  in 
September  '99,  Rodolphe  looked  for some contacts to find  money  to 
produce  the Phenix 260,  using MiNT as the OS in case Dolmen would not 
be ready. 

These  contacts (in particular a long time friend of Rodolphe) got  him 
in  touch  with American business angels.  They were very  enthusiastic 
about  the  Phenix  motherboard (hand routed  by  Rodolphe  CZUBA)  and 
decided  to  start a new project for which Rodolphe CZUBA would  be  in 
charge  of  designing a new and extremely  different  motherboard:  the 
RioRed  G4.  The project would be handled by a new company based in the 
United  States in Richardson TX,  and named "Silicon Fruit".  RioRed is 
the  name of a variety of grapefruit,  which is the symbol of Texas and 
grows in the Rio Grande area. 
 
 Here is a summary of the specifications: 

  - CPU :  2 type 1 slots that can both host a card with a 450 MHz  G4 
   PowerPC, and 2 Mb of L2 cache memory @ 225 MHz  
 - 4 32 bit / 33 MHz PCI slots (133 Mo/s in burst mode) 
 - 2 64 bit / 66 MHz PCI slots  (528 Mo/s in burst mode)
 - IDE UltraDMA 66 controller (4 periphericals)
 - 1  AGP  slot  - 4 USB ports
 - 4 100 MHz SDRAM slots (up to 1  Go,  800 Mo/s) 
 
 It will also be possible to add a PCI card with a very powerful 1  GIPS 
Texas  Instruments DSP. 
 
The basic system provided with the machine will be a Linux distribution 
(maybe YellowDog optimized for the machine's hardware). 
 
There  are  also talks with Be Inc to port BeOs for the  RioRed.  Other 
alternative  systems  are  being  considered such as  QNX  and  -  very 
interesting  for  the  Atari scene - MiNT.  A port,  or the use  of  an 
emulator under Linux are  being considered. 

Fifty   prototypes   of  the  machine  (called  Metanium)   should   be 
manufactured  before  the end of the second quarter of  2000.  A  first 
batch  of  2,000  machines should then be put up for  sale.  The  bi-G4 
version  should  be priced "between a PowerMac G4 bi-proc  and  a  high 
range  PC).  Distribution  will be limited to sales over the  Internet. 
Rodolphe  is currently finishing the design of the first  prototype  in 
collaboration with a software developer in charge of writing a PPC BIOS 
that would allow booting from an Iomega ZIP drive. 

A  forum  is  open so that people interested in the  project  can  have 
contacts with developers and investors. 

  Conclusion.. 

The  idea  of  an  'open'  PowerPC  platform  on  which  a  variety  of 
alternative  systems  could  be  available  is  extremely   attractive. 
Individuals interested in purchasing a machine or willing to take  part 
in  the development / port of software should make themselves known  in 
the discussion forum or to the members of the project. Prototypes might 
be provided to developers for free. 
 
  Wait 'n see..

NB  :  The  Phenix  260  has  not been shelved  but  may  be  developed 
personally by  Rodolphe as a 'hobby'.
