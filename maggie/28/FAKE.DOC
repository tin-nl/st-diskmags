
               ‰Fakery, fakery, it all comes from a bakery?
 
Every issue of Maggie brings with it,  its rich crop of the ne'er quite 
do wells, those demos or intros which have been put together for a rich 
laugh at the worlds expense.

This  issue is no exception,  as we prepare ourselves to write up  this 
latest round of audio-visual onscreen after-curry belches.


  'Ibiza', Poets of Bombay.. (Falcon F030)

 Error  in  Line last Easter was no escape from it ,  as first  off  the 
blocks  was  the  Indian sub-competent demo  makers  'tribute'  to  the 
Balearic Island based club/holiday experience 'Ibiza'.

Bearing  a  surface resemblance to something by the classic  fake  demo 
grandfathers,  "Pacemakers  fused  by  an electric  storm,  so  they're 
probably  dead  by  now"  Senior Dads,  this work soon  gets  into  its 
cheesiest high gear.

Garish images of sun, sea, clublife, and easy sex flash by in time with  
a  cunning selection of phat sounds,  which aren't SID voice  generated 
for once. (Now there's an idea, a club-based Rob Hubbard revival!?) Wow 
to  the  lifelike dancing animations,  scream at the  misadventures  of 
Jeremy  Seedy,  the worlds worst guest DJ and his club-clearing antics. 
Stock up on KY Jelly for next summer now!

It all proves too much,  as the island explodes. Strangely enough, when 
I went there myself, there was a notable absence of mushroom clouds and
radioactive fallout drawn in four colours. All things considered, Ibiza 
was suspiciously intact?

(Clears throat) Ibiza is a classic joke demo, which works superbly with 
the  material  on  offer.  Not a 'purist' fake demo,  which tend to  be 
regarded  as  take-offs  of the best bits  of  current  demo  wizardry. 
Instead,  it  is  a  brilliant joke that all the family  can  join  in. 
Providing  that  the younger members of that family are aged  teen  and 
upwards,  and  the parents don't blush when KY Jelly splashes up on the 
screen?

  Rating:- 80% - It is actually 'Evissa' in the local dialect y'know! 


  'Bugwuerst', Nun.. (Falcon F030) 

What  to  make of this one?  Not too sure.  Memory served me from  that 
historic  Error in Line final night,  that this entry was pretty funny. 
Not as funny as 'Ibiza', the preceding fake entry, but good enough.

Trying  to  make  your  own  hardware make  sense  of  it,  later,  for 
(re)viewing purposes isn't so easy though.

It  starts  off  promisingly  enough with a sort  of  GEM  parody,  the 
'Resolution Butcher' screen.  This is okay. Then on my Nemesised Falcon 
with the Videl switch,  the screen sort of collapses.  On my Centurbo 2 
Falcon,  not much better, as this demo swerves off on a sharp left into 
a black hole?

I might well fiddle around a bit more, but trying different resolutions 
and  combinations of things such as clean systems and RGB patchers  for 
the Nemesised Falcy, didn't get anywhere either?

  Rating:- So I can't really say a lot more about it? 


  'Fake Gameboy', TNB.. (Falcon?)  

The  scene,  the  EIL  competition  viewing room,  it is very  late.  A 
Nintendo Gameboy title screen comes up,  Gameboy styled soundchip music 
burbles  away,  and  we think,  "Hey cool,  something to match Godboy at 
last,  it's  been  ages since the last one of those appeared!" Then  we 
remember  it is too early for the 'wild' competition,  and we are still 
watching the fake entries.

So what happens next isn't too surprising,  as 'press to play' provokes 
a string of GEM error bombs.

This  was  described as 'rather old' by TNB themselves.  It might  have 
been  more effective in pre-Godboy days than it is now?  With the  file 
sizes  being what they are,  you wonder if there is really an emulation 
system in there which didn't quite come off, but then again.......

  Rating:- 67% - Short and predictable.

 
  'EGO demo', NoCrew.. (Falcon F030) 

Not  strictly  a fake demo,  but not really a proper demo  either.  The 
self-styled laziest,  erm,  Scandinavian crew threw together this entry 
for the EIL Falcon megademo section.

The  confusion over its identity discussed in the above paragraph,  was 
reflected in the expressions of puzzlement in the EIL viewing room,  as  
we  all waited for it to stop messing around with static images of  the 
local high street in a 1993 styled 'multi-media' presentation,  and get 
on with the proper stuff.

When  it  became  clear that it wasn't going anywhere  else,  my  brain 
flashed back to the 1993 February 16-Bit show at Wembley Arena.  Hisoft 
were  showing something on their big screen called the  'S.U.C.C.E.S.S' 
demo,  with   lots  of bits of Tina Turner in concert being pulled  off 
hard disk.  Jolting back  to the present, it was as if the last five to 
six years revolution in demo coding hadn't happened at all!

Okay,  so  it  was  nicely put together,  but there are limits to  most 
peoples good nature, and a two meg download for this, is one of them!

  Rating:- 55% - Wait for the CD-ROM compilation, I would.. 


  'Magstarka', Spice Boys.. (Falcon F030) 

It's home movie time in Sweden.  Every St Swithins day,  all the mental 
people  in  Sweden  get their Super  8  cine  cameras/video  camcorders 
(delete  as   applicable)  and  film  the  least  attractive  bits   of 
themselves.

Adding  ultra-modern technology to this unappetising mixture,  such  as 
video digitisers, is, in my view, gilding a rather gruesome lily.

If you've got subject matter such as Evil, and what looks like Baggio's 
gut in close-up, it is time to draw a curtain over this review to avoid 
over-stressing your tired little brains.

Unless  you've  already  seen it,  of course,  in which case,  there is 
little or no hope remaining for you.

  Rating:- Oh dear..

 
  'H Demo IV', by Teenage.. (Falcon F030, STe)  

One  of the notable escapees from the Pre-Millenium party last  summer. 
This  can  best be described as a 'sideways tribute'  to  the  A.N.Cool 
coded  'M-Demo' series by the Carebears.

Well, maybe not so much 'sideways', and more 'bend over'?

This  is yet another effort that teeters between 'fake' and 'real',  as 
the  effects  are flawlessly pulled off (I could really have  put  that 
better?)  and  you get a techno-feast of high speed  images,  a  killer 
sound track,  tightly woven-in animations, and one central 'homo-movie' 
sequence.

I suspect this was the central premise for the whole demo, as the sight 
of  Havoc and Baggio engaged in a simulation of  un-natural  activities 
which might scare zoo animals,  has been digitised for posterity,  then  
replayed back in a variety of ways.

This little bit of animation even had the crowning (in)dignity of being 
converted into a Whip! Virtual Light machine module by Ipir.

This  demo  is fated to cause ripples among the 'moral  majority',  for 
sure.  Expect public burnings of floppy disks in the bible-belt regions 
of the Southern USA once they've seen this!

  Rating:- 80% - Being a queerbear takes a lot of skill! 


 'Agent T Picture Renderer', by Cream.. (Falcon 030, ST)  

A  quick  'recycling'  of Agent T's DHS 4  colour  competition  picture 
winner.  This is a program allegedly 'found' on his hard drive,  by the 
other members of Cream, when he was out of the room.

This claims to show us the secret of his graphical skills.  Running the 
program  sets up an 'auto render' process,  with the competition entry. 
Clearly,  this  contradicts  the  man's own claims to  high  levels  of 
freehand  artistic skill,  but he does seem to have hidden talents as a 
coder!! Candyman, move over!

Not so much 'F6 Part 3',  but more 'Press enter and let this lot do all 
the work for me!'

  Rating:- 77% - Graphic, but no sex or violence!
