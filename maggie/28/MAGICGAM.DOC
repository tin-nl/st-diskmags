
                       ‰The MagiC Game Contest '99

 This  is a departure from all the previous online competitions,  as the 
'serious'  users fight back with one of their own.  The combined forces 
of  Bengy Collins (MagiC Online),  the Atari news provider  'Place2be', 
and assorted prize sponsors from ASH onwards,  all came together to put 
this new idea of online competitions to work for them. We were asked to 
advertise this for them,  and willingly would have done so, but for the 
fact  that  Maggie issue release dates are  assuming  geographical  era 
proportions.

Still,  enough of our misery, instead, you get the consolation prize of 
all these nice games reviewed right here!

In the end,  there were eight entries to the competition. There is also 
another game in here,  which didn't get into the competition, as it was 
prematurely   released,   the  always  interesting  'Rosemary  Rancoon' 
striptease game.

Of further interest, were the entries that apparently didn't make it in 
the  end.  In this spirit,  we bid a sad farewell to the missing 'MagiC 
Lands'  (a Mario style game?) There were also mentions for a  Pipemania 
game, and a Defender in GEM. We hope to see these appear someday?

Well, let's take a look at those that did make it....


  Asteroids, by Mario Becroft. 

First  off,  is a high authenticity vector line based blast-em up  from 
the very early eighties,  made to enjoy being on a multi-tasking O/S on 
a  TOS computer.  The author is New Zealand based hardware genius Mario 
Becroft. The game, Asteroids.

I had some previous contact with a beta version of this game, thanks to 
Mario.   This  was  essentially  complete,  but  with  an  occasionally 
embarrassing  'running out of bullets' bug.  I am happy to report  that 
the full rate of fire is maintained throughout the final version!

He has put in quite a lot of work 'behind the scenes' The graphics  are 
very authentic,  and stay that way,  no matter how you choose to resize 
the game window, as these are scaleable vectors. There is sound support 
with  superb  samples  for  DMA  compatible  Atari's  (Falcon/TT).  Not 
forgetting  to  mention,  that you can configure it any which  way  you 
wish.

It plays well,  subject to a minimum power level of a 16 mhz CPU,  with 
FPU.  This  is acceptable running under MagiC,  with not too big a game 
window,  better  in  a 16 colour mode,  and better with a lower  screen 
resolution where possible.  With a CT2,  and higher, then there is more 
than enough speed, and you can either tweak it down, or adjust the game 
window  to a larger size onscreen.  It prefers MagiC (should run  under 
Mint?) but will run under single TOS, with NVDI installed.

Control can be a choice of mouse or keyboard,  the mouse is responsive, 
the keyboard controls feel a little unfinished?

Authenticity levels are high, but not quite perfect, as the saucers are 
too  easy  to  avoid,  and  some of the background  sound  effects  are 
missing, Mario has not had a lot of experience with the arcade cabinet, 
to be fair to him.

But you can guess I liked this one a lot!

 Conclusion - It's classic Asteroids, nothing more, or less.  


  Orb, by Mario Becroft. 

Mario's  second  entry from a strong challenge put in by  him  to  this 
contest (three in all).  This is another timeless classic,  with a more 
misleading title,  as what you get,  isn't something with an 'orb' feel 
to it, (you might think of something like a NetHack clone) but instead, 
it is a GEM windowed version of Sokoban.

This  uses a very similar GEM shell to Asteroids,  and supports  modern 
GEM/MagiC features like that game does, resizeable window etc. Speed is 
adequate,  for  whatever  system it runs on.  Graphically,  it does look 
more attractive in 256 colours and above, at least for the backgrounds. 
Ingame presentation is functional,  but on the nice side of functional, 
the  main  game  character looking like  a  suspiciously  potato-shaped 
Dizzy!

There  isn't any sound,  as far as I can tell,  unless system generated 
keyclicks are your thing?

As for gameplay,  it's simply Sokoban,  and using the original maps for 
this.  Push the blocks home, don't get stuck. Another seemingly trivial 
game that magically waves away a couple of hours you didn't realise had 
gone by.
 
Conclusion,   another   well-converted   classic,   gentler-paced  than 
Asteroids.

 
  Pentagon by Mario Becroft.

 Mario's third,  and possibly most ambitious entry to the contest,  this 
is a two-player game,  (as in two human players) where the players have 
to  take  turns to put counters on a board,  trying to complete  a  row 
across (of five). This enlarged game of noughts and crosses also allows 
you  to push the other players counters off the edge of the board,  not 
forgetting that they can do the same to you.

This  not only allows two player access to the same computer,  but  the 
game  is  networkable  too!  Meaning,  that  with  the  right  sort  of 
connection  software  (StinG),you can play against  another  player  on 
another separate computer!

The presentation is more obviously tilted towards higher end  machines, 
with  a gorgeous looking background 'tile'.  (there may be an option to 
add your own backgrounds to this game?)

The only weakness from what looks like quite a fun game, is the lack of 
a computer player option. Unless there is another Atari-loving human in 
the vicinity (not always easy,  I know),  this becomes as worthwhile as 
single player arm-wrestling!

 Conclusion, looks like it could be a real laugh, but needs two players. 


  AtariGO by Herbert Waltz. 

This is probably the game closest to an older school of design. It is a 
computerised  version  of  the board game Go!  It  is  entirely  German 
language  based,  readme  and all,  but anyone familiar with the  basic 
rules won't have any problem with that.

The  look  of  the game is very functional  and  GEM-like  indeed,  the 
computer player seems to have lightning reflexes, whatever speed of TOS 
computer  it is running under.  So this is the game most happy on a low 
powered machine.

One intriguing footnote to this game, the MagiC games contest specified 
that any entries had to be games not seen or released before.  This one 
not  only looks older than the rest,  in general design terms,  it also 
has a copyright date from 1994 to the present?

 Conclusion, not pretty, but it does the job. 


  BoinkOut II by Dan Ackerman. 

There already is a GEM version of Break-Out,  it was by Atari Corp, and 
the  less  said  about  it now,  the better.  This  interpretation,  is 
thankfully nothing like that.

In  fact,  this  version is a conversion of a half-remembered early  ST 
game,  by  Samuel Streeper,  and it can be positioned somewhere between 
the  basic   unadorned  Breakout,  and the rather more  snazzy  looking 
Arkanoid, as mixed in with the simple bat and ball action, you do get a 
certain number of  power-ups thrown in,  such as multi-balls, difficult 
to  kill  bricks,  something  called  a 'magic  bottom'  (?!)  and  the 
completely mad and scary total darkness screen(!)

Visuals are great, especially in 256+ colour modes, and with reasonably 
powered Atari's,  it slips by super-smoothly, (A bit too quickly on CT2 
plus  MagiC perhaps?) It really is speed critical,  and benefits from a 
faster  machine,  still  playable,  but a bit too juddery on a standard 
Falcon. it can be speed-tweaked if you are running it on a Hades, so at 
least you can get a meaningful game that isn't over in 2.5 seconds!

You also tweak it further by loading in your own background images,  or 
maybe try a little level editing,  if you are feeling adventurous.

Sound  is limited to a bunch of YM-generated bleeps and scrunches,  but 
these are entirely appropriate to the game.

Out  of  all of the entries in this competition,  this is probably  the 
most polished and professional feeling.

 Conclusion - great work, surely GEM Turrican can't be too far off?! 


  GEM Peaks by Christian Putzig. 
 
It's  a  card game,  a super-elaborate version of somethign  or  other, 
reminded me of Solitaire, or one of the other Windows card games.

It  invades  the whole screen,  it looks sumptuous in scale,  and it is 
entirely in German.

An  English docfile,  even a partial one,  would have been a great help 
here,  as it is,  we can only guess about this one.  (Ruftrade does not 
get into .HYP files too easily.)

 Conclusion,  strictly for card-game fans, looks like a good 'un for the 
genre! 
 

  Milanopoly, by Matthias Jaap. 

Like  Atari Go!,  this is another interpretation of a famous boardgame. 
Unlike Atari Go!  This is an extremely ambitious project, a GEM version 
of the arch-capitalist's starter kit 'Monopoly' (trademark of  someone, 
or other...)

 Digression:-  When Bill Gates played monopoly as a young child,  did he 
allow anyone else to take turns, or have any money, or did he just yell 
"It's all mine and no arguments from the rest of you!"
 
It  has (almost) the full range of options,  and a board which has been 
cunningly  altered in places to reflect a slightly more  computer-based 
boardscape.  You can build houses,  but not hotels,  otherwise, all the 
other game elements are in there.

Features  such  as  dice roll,  and the various  community  chest  type 
random-factor  cards are all in there.  The only thing that is missing, 
are  the  little lead pieces,  but there always was  something  strange 
about making a minature metallic Yorkshire terrier go to jail?

It looks good,  if a little bit small.  I'm too used to the larger size 
of  the original board game.  Original Monopoly fans may well miss  the 
reassuring  tactile  feel of holding chunky amounts of  cash  in  their 
sweaty palms!

The money for this one is in Euros, but don't let that worry you!

Like Mario Becroft's Pentagon game,  it is a two player effort,  and as 
with  that  entry,  there is no computer player option.  
 
Conclusion,  good clean capitalistic fun,  you're not forced to turn to 
those Wintel PC's for that sort of thing now!
 

  Fanwor by Thomas Huth. (Thothy) 
 
We now turn to a game which is nearest to a 'scene' perspective on  the 
MagiC games contest. This takes a Zelda type graphical arcade adventure 
and sticks it in a GEM window!

This  one  is  by the authors of  STune,  (previewed  separately),  and 
features  luxuries (for GEM games) such as Jaguar powerpad  support,  a 
choice  of  sampled  sound effects or PSG generated  noises,  and  even  
modfile  music  in the background if you want it,  (courtesy  of  MSG's 
Zelda tune.) 

The  game  has you looking for eight scattered pieces  of  a  gemstone, 
killing or avoiding the creatures in your path.  Unwanted contact loses 
the  player energy or 'hit points',  a zero amount of these means  game 
over.  Finding the pieces of gemstone restores your energy, finding all 
eight brings peace back to the land (for the moment at least.)

It  runs  well enough,  even on lower powered systems,  but the  window 
looks  a  little  small  on higher  screen  resolutions  and  can't  be 
dynamically resized,  in the manner of, say, the Mario Becroft entries. 
You are playing with minute flyspeck figures,  although this game looks 
quite respectable on lower resolution screens.

The  other  naughty tendency it has,  is an occasional failure to  quit 
properly  when  asked,  which  makes a clean shutdown of  MagiC  a  tad 
impossible. Japad support is there, but in practice, I still prefer the 
cursor  keys  as  my  choice of control method,  as  the  Jagpad  feels 
slightly  uncertain  in  use.  (But  that might  be  down  to  personal 
preferences?)

At  the  end of the day,  this is a creditable attempt to bring  Godboy 
type  fun  to  the MagiC owning masses those people  not  blessed  with 
the sacred covenant of the F030!

 Conclusion - No one is safe from the long arm of the 'Scene'!

 
  Rosemary Rancoon, by Michel Desangles. 

This one didn't make it to the competition,  as it crept out too early, 
however,  it  is  available  from  the same site as  the  rest  of  the 
competition entries, and it is being looked at here accordingly.

This is a characteristically gallic stir of the diverse GEM game  theme 
pot,  as we get a 'paper/scissors/stone' scenario, utilised as the main 
game engine here.

You are locked in mortal combat with the deadliest enemy of them all, a 
cartoon  representation  of a female figure,  recognisable from a  very 
early  striptease  game!  Strangely enough,  the aim of the game hasn't 
changed  one jot,  but you have gained stumbling attempts at bargaining 
for nudity in a GEM window!

There are a choice of three,  ranging from (fairly) easy, right through 
to 'Is she ever going to run out of things to take off!?'

There is the novelty of Bubble-GEM support (in French) is there if  you 
want  it,  and this accompanies every successful,  or unsuccessful move 
that you make in the form of a speech caption from the female 'player'.

Tends to look and move fine on just about every configuration.

 Conclusion, one for dirty-minded children of all ages!!  


Well,  the first MagiC games contest succeeded in generating a wide and 
varied set of entries.  Board and card games,  a staple theme of system 
legal  stuff in the past,  were popular here,  with four of the entries 
more or less falling into that category. More dynamic, and difficult to 
implement,  arcade-based games made up most of the rest,  with Rosemary 
Rancoon very much standing there as the 'odd woman out'!

National  preferences expressed themselves strongly,  with two or three 
games purely in German,  and one in French.  None of them were too hard 
to  figure  out,  even with the language barrier.  The other  potential 
barrier  to  enjoyment  on a couple of these,  was the  compulsory  two 
player  requirement.  Maybe a computer intelligence should be added for 
future versions of Milanopoly and Pentagon?

This  competition was a roaring success,  I believe other  competitions 
from  MagiC Online are to follow,  and I was only half joking about GEM 
Turrican! (Or how about 'Let's write a new Atari Web Browser!)
