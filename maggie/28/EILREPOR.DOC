            A Tale of Error in Line from a Maggie viewpoint!

 Boring bit before we get stuck in:- There is some party-based  realtime 
text  action too.  This has been given its own home,  in recognition of 
the fact that it got quite a bit bigger than previous realtime efforts. 
The major slice of thanks for this has to go to Joe Cool for loaning  a 
Mega  ST  for  the party duration.  This enabled me to go quite  a  bit 
further  on the realtime side of things than has been the case  before. 
Thanx Joe, you're a star, in any one of fifteen languages!   

                              -----v-----

There was a party this Easter, and this was possibly the greatest party 
since  the glory days of the 'Old' ST scene.  Certainly a party to hold 
up  proudly in the grand halls of memory with the great Falcon  parties 
of the Fried Bits and Siliconvention era.

I was very pleased to attend the Error in Line (EIL) party,  witnessing 
Atari  history  in the making.  Based on events here,  surely,  the best 
times for Ataridom are NOW!

But as the narrator flashes back to the beginning,  it certainly didn't 
seem like that for a while....

                              -----v-----

This is the party that crept up on me, I almost didn't make it there. 

Recent  events had been taking my attention away from the  party.  With 
another person in my life to account to for your movements,  going away 
for five or six days on my own seemed like a decadent and  unattainable 
luxury.  I  was  very carefully considering how to broach the topic  to 
Nicky,  tiptoeing  around it like a bomb disposal operative sitting  in 
the  'cheap seat' next to something large,  black painted,  and ticking 
loudly. 

It took Felice,  who  constantly  ventures in where angels fear to tread, 
to  blurt it out when I wasn't looking.  I'm not sure if this caused or 
saved a whole load of trouble, but what was done, was done, and I don't 
think the immediate pre-party departure tension could have been avoided 
anyway.  Maybe  next  time a situation like this  needs  ultra-delicate 
handling, I'll nail his mouth shut!

I  managed  to  mostly  ignore the build-up to  the  party,  unlike  in 
previous years where I've started ticking the days off to go to Easter, 
shortly  after Xmas finished.  Again,  a lot of other things were going 
on,  and  it got to the final days before,  when things started hitting 
home  a  bit harder.  The physical preparations,  flight booking,  etc, 
passed in a haze.

 Day One, the departure... 

Nicky  didn't  actually  collapse into a black hole of  despair  at  my 
prospective  departure  until the night before,  which was pretty  good 
going  on her part,  thinking back.  We'd had a couple of nice days off 
together  beforehand to cushion the blow of me going away,  but she was 
convinced that I wasn't going to come back!  It was as if we were going 
to an execution,  or to be told of a death in the family when I set off 
to the railway station.

After managing to convince her I wasn't going halfway around the  world 
never to return, I set off. It was a more subdued realtime commencement 
than  normal,  the  journey  to the airport by train no  more  or  less 
tedious than usual. The day was cheerful, I was not.

Things  pick  up a little when I get to Heathrow Airport,  as  the  two 
Richards, Requiem  and  Felice,  are waiting there.  I look at the long 
Lufthansa check-in queue,  look more closely at the family with fifteen 
pieces  of luggage checking in very slowly at the front of  that  queue 
and  my fragile and recently recovered feeling of well-being  collapses 
back  again.  Fortunately,  a briskly efficient check-in person working 
down  the  queue  decides  that my big bag  can  go  through  as  'hand 
luggage'. This  is  fine,  but it is moderately heavy to carry,  loaded 
with clothing, sleeping equipment and all. For such an advanced mode of 
travel as jet-powered flight, there seems to be an awful lot of walking 
involved?

 Rule  1 for travellers to coding parties.  Always make sure you  forget 
something  that  you really need later on in an  erroneous  attempt  to 
'save space'.  In my case,  it was a towel, which got me drummed out of 
the Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Appreciation Society!

 A  quick pause for Burger King related fodder later satisfies  the  two 
Richards.  (I  dined  out London Transport style on a totally  dry  and 
unappetising  bagel earlier.) We go on to the security check-in,  where 
Felice   manages  to  provide  more  unintentional   entertainment   by 
registering on the metal detector, and getting a free body-frisk all to 
himself!  Those  of  us who passed through without incident  looked  on 
enviously!

It  only  remained  for  us to wait in the  departure  lounge  for  the 
aircraft to be readied,  noting with dismay that a large consignment of 
PCs  were  being  loaded on as cargo.  Not the only  sort  of  computer 
though,  as  Requiem had entrusted a partially dismantled Falcon to the 
tender  mercies  of the baggage handlers,  who were  moonlighting  from 
their evening jobs as nightclub bouncers,  potentially.  (It got to the 
party unscathed.)

The flight is called, bit by bit, according to a letter on your ticket, 
and  we  wait. More letters are called,  and we still wait.  With great 
reluctance   and   gritted  teeth  on  the  part  of   Lufthansa,   our 
letter/number is called and we finally board the aircraft. 

It  is  a  huge  Airbus,  a  wide-bodied 300 seater  job,  and  we  are 
'somewhere  down  the  back'.  A momentary seat identity  confusion  is 
resolved  and  we  park  ourselves slap in the  midst  of  a  party  of 
pubescent  girls,   the  oldest  among  them  about  thirteen  who  are 
generating a fair bit of sound and motion. (But nothing like as much as 
MSG at the party!)

Aircraft takes off.... Pushed back in seat type thrills ensue..

It  is  a short ride this time,  about an hour.  We barely have time to 
gulp  down  the  free drink and home-made  crusty  (but  absolutely  A1 
delicious,  it  has to be said!) sandwich before the aircraft starts to 
descend.  The first part of our journey is over,  all over the place in 
Frankfurt airport in fact.

Two  hours  to wait for our connecting flight to sunny  Dresden,  can't 
really remember too much about it, amazing how boredom erases the mind?

Oh yes, there was a spot more walking around. Frankfurt airport is very 
smart  and  clean,  stereotypical  Germany at its best,  but done in  a 
brain-numbing  grey  decor.  There  is  a waiting  area,  and  we  help 
ourselves to free coffee,  free newspapers, and a free close-up view of 
an  ominous  looking  briefcase left unattended  that  plainly  screams 
"Bomb!" at us.  But instead of doing anything vaguely sensible,  we opt 
to  start  writing  in  the pen 'n paper  realtime  article  about  it, 
fortunately,  the owner of the briefcase comes to collect it before too 
much silliness takes over.

 I've  often wondered how much time and attention should be given  to  a 
realtime  text,  when  in moments of possible extreme danger.  I've got 
visions  of  a  bunch  of Maggie Team people in  the  final  stages  of 
realtime-itis on board the Titanic. They make no attempts to save their 
lives, but are typing/writing away right to the bitter end.

"02.20hrs - The waves close over our heads, helllp mmmpph glubbb!!!"

Stupid, or what? It could have happened like that though!
   
 The coffee is strong, the plane delayed.

Eventually,  our  flight is called,  and it is down a flight of stairs, 
jammed in at close proximity to a halitosis breath monster who had been 
heavily abusing the beer and garlic sausages.  We board a bus,  and are 
taken  on  a  terrifying rat-run tour  of  Frankfurt  airport,  dodging 
through the aircraft taxiways to get to the connecting flight.  I'm not 
sure  if  there were any 'Give way to Aircraft' signs there,  but  they 
might have been a good idea?

On  the  Dresden  flight,   and  an  attractive  Mediterranean  looking 
stewardess does her 'pull down the oxygen mask/inflate the  lifejacket' 
figure-hugging  pantomime,  hinting  at untold possibilities,  right in 
front of me.  I remember just in time that this is my week off from all 
of that, and I am still recovering from the immediate period before the 
trip,  where  Nicky  was,  how  shall  we put it,  "making up for  lost 
time(!)" 

This  trip  is  even  shorter,   and  it  is  with  a  certain  air  of 
anticipation, that we land at Dresden.

A nervous wait for baggage is rewarded as Requiem is reunited with  the 
partially  dismanted  Havoc-bound Falcon,  which happily  survived  the 
journey.  Soon, loaded with bags, we set off to find our contact at the 
airport,  Joe Cool of Checkpoint,  who we assume is waiting for us, but 
neither side has anything to go on to identify each other.

Fortunately,  it  is  Joe who has had the inspirational brain-burst  of 
bringing  a card with an Atari Fuji logo to identify himself  with.  We 
cheer and rush over, happy that any mistaken or missed identity hassles 
have been beaten by the genius of this man!

Thankful that this final bit of the journey was this easy, we introduce 
ourselves.  Joe seems pleased to meet us,  his girlfriend has a handily 
waiting  car,  just  outside  in the airport carpark.  We wobble  in  a 
heavily loaded fashion into the centre of Dresden.

Dresden road surfaces suck.

Or to be more precise,  they bump you around in a cobbly fashion if you 
dare  to  go at any speed.  Of all the bits of Dresden city,  currently 
undergoing  a  makeover  to  bring  it up to  the  level  of  the  more 
prosperous  western part of Germany,  the roads seem to be last in  the 
queue  for  cash.  We  vividly feel the leftovers of  old  East  German 
puritan  attitude  to personal transport,  which seems to suggest  that 
people impertinent enough to own a car should be punished for it.  Cheap 
political satire gag follows, John Prescott (UK minister for transport) 
is  very  interested  in that idea.  He wants to  hire  Dresden's  road 
maintenance contractors!!

 The  ten  years  since  the reunification  had  almost  seen  the  once 
ubiquitous  Trabant off the streets as more sensible makes of car  came 
in, it was fifteen minutes, and well into the city centre before we saw 
one, and just the one at that. Many things would never be possible in a 
communist country,  the television series 'Top Gear' being one of them. 
(Which may just be the clinching argument needed to justify fifty years 
of Marxist-Leninism?!)

We  drive by the city centre,  past the railway station,  and arrive at 
our destination, a 'cellar-club' hidden in the bowels of a student hall 
of residence.  This is nearly empty,  apart from a few local types, and 
Mr Pink, Arnel, and MSG, also just arrived, and setting up in their own 
corner of the club.  Noisy greetings,  mainly from MSG,  follow.   "I've 
been drinking the local water and I think it's safe!?"  

Mr  Pink  and  MSG  are  trying  out  various  elderly   monitor/Falcon 
combinations. Mr Pink tries and discards a large television, physically 
repelled by the interlace flicker, a 'mono-mental' greyscale VGA screen 
is considered briefly. He finally gets a half-decent colour screen. MSG 
settled  for something yellowed with age that gradually unglued  itself 
as  the  party  wore on,  and coped admirably with displaying  red  and 
green,  and combinations of these two colours thereof.  As this machine 
was  an  almost  permanent 'Protracker'  outpost,  that  didn't  really 
matter. 

Quite  early on,  we are shown our exclusive 'Club Ned' styled sleeping 
quarters,  above-ground  in  a store-room on the first floor.  This  is 
handily away enough from the party hubbub to allow us to sleep when  we 
need  to,  and  apart from one or two others who joined us later on,  a 
welcome private space where this was in very short supply. Even better, 
several sponge-foam mattresses are available to make a very comfortable 
bed with.

About  then,  Felice opened his bag to discover one of his  mullerrices 
had  'escaped'  from  its pot and was roaming freely in  his  big  bag. 
Possibly   a  consequence  of  travelling  at  high  altitude   in   an 
unpressurised  cargo  hold.  Or  maybe it was down to  some  carelessly 
heavy-handed escapades on the part of the baggage handlers?

Felice exits stage left to clean out bag... (Not entirely successfully, 
as  there  were  remnants "Smelling like sick" still in  there  on  the 
following day.)

Back downstairs,  we explore the party venue a bit more intensively. We 
are  still  the  only  arrivals  at  this  stage,  apart  from  various 
Checkpoint people who are  shifting tables and chairs into position. By 
now,  nametags of the expected guests are positioned on their allocated 
tables.  We  wander  around,  in anticipation,  at the great many Atari 
celebrities expected. (Not all of them went into the rooms allocated to 
them.  In  the  'Maggie' room,  for want of a better name for it, I was 
expecting  ST Survivor and a bunch of Swiss guys from an outfit  called 
'Firesoft'.  Instead I got Moondog, and the TNB (Naughty Bytes) people. 
(Not a transaction I'm complaining about though, you understand!)

We  are  all  extremely hungry,  and not a little bit  tired  by  then, 
thoughts turn slowly to food, actions turn even more slowly to ordering 
some.  It is to be pizza,  from the soon to be well remembered and much 
loved 'Amigo Pizza.' This is the first order of a great many,  that had 
the  proprieter  of  Amigo  Pizza rubbing his  hands  cackling  off  to 
purchase a brand new Lear jet from the profits of the EIL weekend.

There is a certain amount of group indecision and waiting around to  be 
undergone, the time-consuming 'who ordered what, and who paid for what' 
arguments break out long before the food gets there. The waiting around 
is  something  else,  and  just when we are about to give up  the  food 
finally arrives.  Welcome boxes piled high and bottles of coke greet us 
with a cheery smile (or was that hunger-induced hallucinations?) and we 
all chow down at warp speed.

 Space to be quiet in, apart from lip smacking noises of appreciation. 

Requiem  and I ordered slab-like 'family' pizzas,  which turn out to be 
way too much of a good thing. The pizzas were very rich and greasy, and 
'uncut', which meant we had to tear off great big messy chunks of them. 
A little refinement at the Amigo Pizza end of things wouldn't have gone 
amiss,  but we are satisfied, not to mention sated, and head off to our 
junkroom/sleeping quarters very soon after.

 Hours of Sleepless end..... 
There is a party of six of us staying in the room that night. We manage 
to  clear  barely enough space for all of us in the random  puddles  of 
junk.  Requiem  bags  the  only proper bed in the far corner,  all  the 
better  to reverberate echoes off the wall?  The rest of us seize  foam 
rubber  mattresses  and prepare to bed down,  and not without a  little 
anxiety.

"Arnel  snores like a pig!" is one anxious comment passed  around.  But 
even if Arnel did snore like a pig, he came nowhere close to overcoming 
Requiems  window  pane vibrating noises.  Arnel manages to  sleep,  his 
snoring  but a gentle 'leaves in the breeze' counterpoint  to  Requiems 
hippo-blasts.  It gets too much around two am-ish,  and the rest of the 
(non-sleeping)  party cracks up in a massive giggling fit at  each  new 
contortion  of  Requiems throat muscles.  We seriously wonder if he  is 
going  to  explode in mid-snore,  say if he decided to suck in air  and 
forgot to stop?  There would be hell to pay in cleaning bits of Requiem 
off the walls, and it is a high ceiling, difficult to reach too!

We  then try to 'stop' Requiem,  throwing things at his sleeping  body, 
scurrying around the room to retrieve some electrical fittings from the 
junkpile  to  wire him to the mains with.  Mr Pink manages to secure  a 
temporary  'noises-off' situation by roaring a scream of untold  agony, 
frustration, and indigestion.

The room gets hotter, Joe Cool turns up at one stage, door thrown open, 
the  passageway  light glaring in,  but his potential pleadings for  an 
Atari  mono  monitor lying in the room go unheard.  Or in  reality,  we 
actually  heard  every   word he said,  but played dead as we couldn't be 
asked to get up! (Sorry Joe!)

Joe  is very helpful in pointing me in the direction of the bathroom  a 
bit  later,  so  at  least  I  manage to  kill  off  my  pizza  induced 
dehydration. MSG was less lucky, staying loyal to his thirst all night. 
Time passes very slowly,  there may have even been some sleep in there, 
but I can't be sure?   Thinking back,  yes there was, as Requiem woke up 
as  it  got  light,  which  gave the rest of us a chance.  In  a  shock 
decision  for  subsequent nights,  Mr Pink decided to sleep  under  his 
Falcon  in  the Reservoir Gods Grotty Grotto,  on the grounds  that  he 
found  it  easier to sleep on a hard floor,  in the midst of the  party 
racket,  than  to  try  to blank out the noises  coming  from  Requiems 
corner!

 Day Two, first party day.. 

 Morning....

Morning has broken,  is well and truly shattered, as we all are, but we 
are mysteriously drawn closer together by this shared overnight ordeal. 
Or maybe the preceding sentence is just complete bollocks?

Showernote:-  Requiem is pleasantly surprised to find the  showers  are 
'unisex',  as  the  attractive  student  body,  clad only in  a  towel, 
testified  to him!  Maggie editor remembers he is remembering what it's 
like  to  be celibate,  and has to mentally kick himself not to  forget 
that!

We collect ourselves and wander back downstairs,  the party is open for 
business with one or two very early arrivals, and so we greet Grey, and 
the Polish gang who are in the process of setting up their equipment on 
a  cluster of tables close by the grotty grotto in the  corridor.  They 
have  managed  to finish ("release") their entry to  the  competitions, 
their  long awaited ST demo,  and start the day by showing old  Shadows 
and Mystic Bytes demos to all who dare to come near.

There  is a certain air of anticipation in the area of the Maggie  room 
too,  as  we are to get our very own loaned computer to run the  Maggie 
realtime  text  from!   I  see  the  computer  in  question,   and  the 
anticipation  is blended in with a little trepidation as it looks  like 
the  grandmother of all heavily home-made computers.  It is a Mega  ST, 
but  no ordinary Mega,  as the power supply has been moved outside  the 
case  to  increase  the  risk of a fatal electric  shock?  There  is  a 
graphics  card inside the beast,  and it only seems to want to work  if 
the  lid  is prised half-open.  And it is left like this,  stood on one 
end,  for the duration of the party.  On the plus side, there is a neat 
hard disk,  for saving of the realtime gumph, and the monitor I'm using 
with  it is loads better than the dodgy old screens left over from  the 
original  1993  Fried Bits convention,  that Mr Pink and MSG are  stuck 
with.

That is a little way in the future though,  and it is the welcome sight 
of  breakfast  that  grabs my attention.  This is a  'build  your  own' 
affair,  very  much  in  a continental style,  from a pile of  assorted 
ingredients,  and  I jostle among some of the early-coming Polish  guys 
collating  improbable  strawberry jam and salami  sandwiches  from  the 
foodpile.  Best  news  of  all,  this is free of charge,  in  plentiful 
quantity, and recommended by the party organisers as a foolproof way to 
start the day!
 
This was just one aspect of the organisation of the party which  really 
made it stand out from others. The organisers really made sure that you 
were  okay,  and  the general care and attention made it feel like  you 
were  being  well looked after by your best friends,  rather than  just 
having  services  provided by a commercial party.  EIL organisers,  you 
were fantastic!

 Nicely  refuelled,  and going back for seconds,  I open a dialogue with 
the  Maggie  realtime  machine,  hoping desperately that it  stays  up. 
(There  were  some  failures earlier on,  but,  in contrast to  another 
realtime text,  no data was lost, and as time went on, the failure rate 
grew  less.  For  the  last 24 to 36 hours of the party,  the  realtime 
carried  on with barely a hitch,  the odd 'sticky' floppy drive  moment 
aside.) (Which I 'cured' by fiddling with the drive lead?)

Typing  in the previous days worth of pen and paper realtime  takes  an 
hour  or so,  and I barely register the arrival of 'The remains of TNB' 
(The  Naughty  Bytes)  in the room.  I look a little bit worried  as  a 
mixing  desk  plonks down on the table next to me,  and  the  remaining 
space  fills  up quickly with assorted computers and  battered  looking 
coffee percolators.  In the seat next to me,  is FXL of TNB, who spends 
most  of  the party composing his competition entries,  listening  back 
through  headphones to them in a caffeine haze,  or sleeping under  the 
table  in the wee small hours of the morning when I'm bashing  away  on 
the realtime.  There is the odd neighbourly touch,  which develops more 
as the party wears on,  as he is motivated to contribute heavily to the 
'German toilet designs' debate in the realtime for example.

Other TNB people set up a mixture of Atari and PC gear. With a possible 
eye to amusing the sadistic sense of humour and irony god,  Moondog, of 
rival Magascene, Undercover, is set up on the table opposite. He brings 
his PC,  and an ST with a Falcon keyboard, which caught out quite a few 
people  at  the party as to its true parentage.  The overpowering  good 
nature of this sort of event ensures no harm comes to either of us.  As 
if it would anyway!

Moondog  isn't  quite  what  I'd previously imagined  him  to  be.  The 
animated  and  passionate (to the point of shouting  in  textual  form) 
editor/writer in the pages of Undercover turns out to be a calm,  tall, 
stolid, and reasonable sort of bloke, totally unlike his more excitable 
'scene  persona'.  Like  the rest of TNB,  he is into music,  playing a 
selection of retro eighties/modern stuff hybrid mixes.

One thing he did comment on, which seems to bear out subsequent events, 
was  that  he was lacking motivation to carry on with  Undercover,  and 
even the PC side of the 'scene' wasn't as interesting either!  He hoped 
that the EIL releases and party atmosphere was going to kickstart a new 
interest  in  all of that.  At time of writing (May 99),  we are  still 
unsure.

A  quick  digression follows.  We are given a registration pack,  Amigo 
Pizza leaflets,  voteforms for the competitions,  etc. Included in this 
is a  'medal' for identity purposes. This is commemorating some kind of 
sporting event, and looks like a cheap souvenir of the recent communist 
past.  Indeed it turns out to be just that,  not a prized winners medal 
though,  but  just  something handed out to people who turned up at  an 
event!  Sort  of  "sorry  you  didn't win,  or are going to  amount  to 
anything much in the future, but hey, we're still thinking about you!"

From  time to time,  I pop back to see how the storm is brewing in  the 
Reservoir Gods Grotto.  Mr Pink plugs away at a bunch of 3D objects for 
a production that is never in any real danger of being finished in time 
for  the  competitions.  (He did clean up on the 128  byte  competition 
though!)  MSG  is surgically attached to headphones working on  a  tune 
which  is  tragically too long for the competition time limit,  a  fact 
only  discovered at the last minute.  Mr Pink is putting a strong entry 
for  the under-publicised 'smoke as many cigarettes as you can  put  in 
your mouth competition',  he would at the very least,  have won a prize 
there.

Arnel and Requiem flit around the place,  Requiem last seen alive among 
a  group of un-neutered Swedes.  Another frequently seen visitor to the 
Grotty  Grotto,  is the constantly smiling figure of Tommy of the Comic 
Pirates,   gathering material for his report for the multi-scene 'network 
News'    webzine.  Constantly smiling in a rictus as a by-product of fear 
though,  as  MSG and Mr Pink together at a party is one of the scariest 
sights possible!

Now this is getting a little ahead of events,  but some sort of 'ground 
plan' of where people were,  would be useful. More people were arriving 
by the mid-afternoon, and EIL looked something like this.

The  cellar-club  venue was divided into  'smoking'  and  'non-smoking' 
ends.  The  main  entrance was at the 'non-smoking' end,  and stairs go 
down into the main 'hall', really, the largest and most open of all the 
rooms,  where the competition entries ran their courses. This main hall 
contained  the  big  screen projector,  Checkpoint  and  various  other 
organising people,  tSCc, several Linux boxes with internet connection, 
the  Undercover Realtime text,  and the Mad Butcher with the sole 8-Bit 
Atari  presence at the party.  This 'hall' was rather small,  and there 
was a mighty struggle to get everyone in to view the competitions.

First  on  the  left,  is  the Maggie/TNB room,  complete  with  Maggie 
realtime  and a respectably-sized music studio that somehow got  itself 
built into there.  A bit further along (right) are the Swedes in a room 
of their own,  with a lot of bodies (a lot per body, in certain cases!) 
and   even   more  equipment.   This  room  happens  to   contain   the 
bar/foodcounter, but the Swedes avoid too much public scrutiny of their 
competition  entries by sitting 'backs to the wall'.  (Or was that  for 
some  other  reason?!)  Also living in there  is  Energiser,  the  lone 
attending member of 'old scene demo giants Lazer.  (Who turns out to be 
have some interesting stories, later on.)

About  where the 'smoking' and 'non-smoking' zones begin to  blur,  are 
the rooms containing such luminaries as Cream, The Lunatic Asylum, RDT, 
Cobra,  and FireSoft,  all busy on their activities. The odd Amiga, PC, 
and  even Milan can be seen pleading for their lives to be  spared,  in 
amongst all the militant purist Atari users.

Firmly in the smoking zone, in the corridor, are the Poles, joined by a 
small French contingent (Loud).  YesCrew turn up later on.  Progressing 
(or  degenerating)  rapidly towards the far end of the party,  are  the 
Reservoir  Gods  and  associated hangers-on,  and furthest  up  in  the 
corridor,  the late evening-arriving Dutchies.  Then it was just a case 
of keeping going a little bit more through a couple of fire doors until 
we found the staircase to go up to our sleeping room.

This almost certainly misses out quite a few people, and I apologise to 
them  now,  there were some non-affiliated arrivals,  such as Partycle, 
remembered from last years 'ALT Party', in there too.

Another thing that was supposed to happen at the party, but didn't, due 
to  lack  of availability of a certain type of computer at  my  end  of 
things,  was  the release of a one-off 'special' issue of Maggie.  This 
was themed on a sceptics viewpoint of UFO's, Roswell, and all the other 
tales  of the unexpected,  and was rather grandiosly titled "The Psycho 
Babble Project." Again, as of time of writing, a final release is still 
awaited,  and held up on the A) Wrong sort of source code/music player, 
or, B) Lack of an ST to test the music player on.

I'd  worked hard in the weeks up to the party,  and I'd thought I'd got 
it finished in time.  I brought a couple of disks with me, intending to 
release it there. I managed to see it running fine on Mr Pink's Falcon, 
and  managed to pass it in the direction of Grey.  It didn't run on the 
Maggie  realtime Mega ST,  but I thought that had something to do  with 
the  fact  that  it had a third party video card and  was  a  generally 
strange  machine.  Undeterred  I  tried  it on  Moondog's  ST.  Nothing 
happened. Tried it on Pacifist on Moondog's PC. 

Nope.  Damn! 

I  got really worried when it refused to run on ST Survivors ST,  a bit 
later on,  I mentally kicked myself for not testing on an ST, or having 
a  working  ST to test it on.  The Psycho Babble Project wasn't  making 
much  sense as an ST shell only co-operating with the Falcon.  If  your 
copy  does  this,  it is a rare,  or 'wrong' copy someone passed to you 
from the EIL Party. Delete it now, and get a new fully working one from 
your dealer!

Never mind though.  There were other distractions freely being aired at 
the party,  as Undercover open their realtime text on an ST in the main 
hall.  This  does  quite well,  even in spite of losing the first  days 
worth of text at some mysterious vanishing overnight sort of hour. 
Alibi note:- I was very asleep at the time, and didn't do it!

 It also turns out that there is to be an active role played by the  TNB 
guys  in  the  competition.  Quite apart from the several  tunes  being 
worked  on by the more musical members.  Drizzt has a demo  competition 
entry   to  hand!   The  soon  to  be  enjoyed  by  the  party   masses 
'Rumplekammer' has its first showing in nearly complete form.  TNB guys 
watch with obvious enjoyment.  I watch with obvious enjoyment. TNB guys 
realise  that  the  secrecy  of  their  'secret'  production  has  been 
compromised with me in there, but it's too late!

'Rumplekammer'  is an old style demo,  but with a lot of modern twists, 
and  very nice design throughout.  It went up against some very  strong 
competition,   and  had  the  ultimate  misfortune  to  go  up  against 
Checkpoints 'All time greatest' effort 'Suretrip'.
 
 All around,  people are working furiously on their productions.  In the 
end, the main demo competition deadlines had to be constantly extended, 
almost to the point where the competitions started.

There  were  still other things for me to do.  I was trying to  make  a 
phone call back to the UK to reassure a certain person that I was still 
alive  and  well,  and  Joe kindly offered me the use of  the  internal 
phone.  This doesn't like any attempt to dial out,  and turns out to be 
an  'internal' telephone in the strictest sense of the word.  I  really 
risk  a lot by staggering up the cellar stairs into daylight,  where  a 
callbox  awaits.  Success!  As  I get through to Nicky and check all is 
okay  at  home.  She  sounds a lot more together and  happier  than  at 
Thursdays  dismal  parting.  I  go  back  down  into  the  party  throb 
reassured.

I end up back in the TNB/Maggie room, chatting to Moondog again. he has 
his  PC  running,  and has some interesting views on the  different  PC 
diskmags.  I'd already seen a copy of 'Hugi',  and to look at, it looks 
very much like a sophisticated version of the Undercover  hermaphrodite 
shell,  and  with  a lot of the articles devoted to  scene-based  navel 
gazing.  (You know the sort of thing - "The scene sucks, but it sucks a 
little bit less since the last issue when I wrote this same article  in 
a slightly different fashion!") Moondog also shows off a bunch of other 
very  different  PC  diskmags,   including  one  which  looks  like  an 
interactive  version  of a glossy company brochure,  all 'design',  and 
articles in a very small hi-res font you can't quite read. 

In a burst of delicious irony, he states that 'Hugi' was too much about 
the  ego  of its editor,  and the 'rightness' of their views.  I  avoid 
making snide and easy comparisons, as I'm a nice easy going person!

Felice  stops and has a chat with Moondog too,  delighting in the  fact 
that he has a new audience. One (potentially) controversial footnote is 
with  Felice as a Freddie Starr figure of the games design  world  with 
his "Role playing game based on the Holocaust!"
 And  just  how  does that one work,  eh?  "Find crust of  bread,  avoid 
beating by guards." Or worse still, try it from the other end. "You are 
failing  to  fulfil your quota to fill the gas chambers,  and  must  do 
better or else!" I shudder to think!
 
Such  breathless  antics only serve to inspire a mass breakout  in  the 
direction of some more food. Some of us decide that we ought to make an 
effort to sample some of Dresdens rebuilt culture,  and go out into the 
night air to make a quick dash for the Burger King!

Four of us,  Requiem, Felice, Arnel and myself venture out of the party 
cellar/bunker,  dodge  roadworks,  consider  the (stiff) penalties  for 
crossing the road before you're supposed to,  and land up in a shopping 
precinct  just  past the railway station.  This does not belong to  the 
'historic'  part of the city,  as it is built as a pastiche of the Bull 
Ring  Shopping  Centre in Birmingham.  The end result is a  mid-sixties 
neo-brutal concrete classic, but somewhat cleaner than the real thing!?

Of  all the bars and gin-joints and cake shops in the world,  we had to 
walk into Burger King.  This is like all other Burger Kings everywhere, 
but with a different language,  although the staff have a goodish grasp 
of English anyway.  We order food,  tell Felice to take off his nametag 
and 'identity' medallion from the party, as people are staring a little 
more intently at him than usual,  collect the food and eat. Afterwards, 
we wander around, taking in the 'ambience' a little.

Things to remember from sunny Dresden centre, in the dead of night..

Not a lot, unless concrete, arranged in a style rejected as 'too bleak' 
by the planners of inner-city housing estates in Liverpool,  appeals to 
you.  There was a 'Conrad Electronics' store, one of the major sponsors 
of  the  party.  Momentary  amusement  is derived from  their  logo,  a 
stylised  capital  'C' drawn back when the Commodore 64  was  the  only 
computer offering artistic possibilities to the masses.  Indeed,  it is 
suggested  they still offer C64 stuff,  which is nice of them.  We also 
stop  at the central railway station,  at Arnels instigation,  which is 
 very  brave of him, bearing in mind memories of Hamburg '96! He is there 
to  get  some train times,  and a handy 'print your own' terminal  hums 
away happily as it digs out his return journey times.

Back  at the party,  I catch glimpses of gloriously mad tunnel  effects 
from  Checkpoints soon-to-be-winning the competition  'Suretrip'  demo, 
and from what I see, I conclude that this will really rock da house! At 
that stage,  I thought I was getting a pretty full production,  but had 
no idea how massive the final entry was, which just went on, and on!

The other major news of the evening is the delayed arrival of the Dutch 
contingent,  and  the  misfortune Earx suffered on the way over when  a 
fraudulently deaf cashier decided that a 100DM note (About 30-odd  UKP) 
wasn't  a  100DM note,  but a much lesser amount,  when giving Earx his 
change!  (A  situation  familiar  to countless people using  fast  food 
stands at large public venues across the galaxy!) For the remainder  of 
the  party,  a beerglass with the poignant if misspelt label  "Sponsore 
the  lost money of the Dutch" sits on the bar,  collecting bits of very 
small change.
 
 The  evening period sees the Maggie realtime machine back to some  kind 
of form, after a lengthy layoff and I catch up. Then back to the den of 
iniquity and heavy smoking that is the Reservoir Gods residence.  Tommy 
of  Comic Pirates fame is still there,  and still smiling.  If you look 
 really  closely at him,  you can see the matchsticks holding the grin in 
place. 

It is getting late, if not excessively so, but we are getting tired, so 
steel ourselves for another night of Requiem generated snoring  antics. 
The  rest  of  the party,  not having shared  this  wonderfulness,  are 
gearing up for an overnight stretch of frantic entry finishing. Made of 
less stern stuff, four of us retire to our secret lair up the stairs.

 Off to bed..
 More hours of sleepless end?

Well,  no actually, as tiredness soon overcame our potential admiration 
of  Requiems  nightly  performance,  in reality,  some proper  sleeping 
ensued!

When we do wake up, we're in no particular hurry to get up, safe in the 
knowledge  that the party is always where it was,  when we left it last 
night.  (If  a  bit more ragged around the edges,  and a lot more tired 
than before.)
 
 Day Three, second party day..

 People  get up and leave the sleeping room/junkroom as they  feel  like 
it.  I  visit the bombed out and lonely looking bathroom (the state  of 
which forms a strand of speculative enquiry in the realtime a bit later 
on!) And stagger down in the general direction of the party. Mr Pink is 
bundled  under  a  table in the grotto,  in an attitude  that  suggests 
'asleep'.  The next step is to check out the breakfast counter ordering 
a  very large coffee,  and stocking up on breakfast In addition to  the 
various  combinations of bread and foodstuffs,  there are also homemade 
cakes,  which  are  very  nice,  if a bit early.  The Swedes sit in the 
gentle cathode glow behind me, working to their own strange rhythms and 
desires.

Then  to  the TNB/Maggie room to see if there is any  realtime  machine 
left.  Happily, it still runs, and even more happily, one or two people 
also  connected with the use of the room have added to it overnight  as 
well.  Including one very unkind person,  who jumped in shortly after I 
had signed off last night..

Blantantly recycled realtime extract now follows!
 
23.34
Hey  guys,  this  is getting silly.  Don't you have anything else to do 
with  your  hard  earned time than to waste it  in  writing  real-time-
articles? In the end it will be impossible to beat us. Your frontier is 
*not* the ucm-article of this party, but the one written on the "black-
hole '94" in Gatterstaedt. 74 k of pure Hirntod. Muchas gracias.

 Nice  to see someone has the courage of their convictions to  say  what 
they  really  thought of us,  now if they had bothered to  leave  their 
name??

Ours  was  not  the only realtime afflicted by  troublemakers,  as  the 
Undercover effort had also suffered overnight,  losing the entire first 
days worth of text! This was not the best start they could have had for 
the party, but they soon recovered magnificently for the remaining days 
at the party.

Also at this time.  FXL of TNB is asleep under the table, as I'm sure I 
prodded him with my feet a few times.  Earx is glimpsed working on bits 
of  his  rather nice Falcon demo,  which only just missed  winning  the 
competition.

I go over to take a closer look at what Earx is doing. He is working on 
an  entry  to  the Falcon demo competition,  and what I see,  which  is 
pretty much nearly all of it,  is terrifically good, with manic effects 
switching,  and  funky  textured 3D objects in there.  There is still a 
little bit of screen glitching on one of the effects, which never quite 
left it in time for the competition viewing.  Also, some effects look a 
lot better on a decent VGA monitor. This is also touted as working on a 
Centurbo II,  something I've yet to verify, as of time of writing, with 
my bugged DSP controller revision B version.  July update:- With the DSP 
now  at an 'intermittent' working state on turbo mode,  I can verify it 
does!! It rocks on high definition and 100khz SVGA too!  

We chat a bit more,  Earx mainly active on the demo side of things with 
an  upcoming intro for Undercover 15.  His game projects are proceeding 
very slowly,  and in the case of 'Solos',  his Elite/Frontier mega-game 
for  the  Falcon,  in  the deep freeze.  Earx is enjoyable company,  as 
friendly  in the flesh,  as he was with his previous internet and  mail 
contact with us.

The rest of the UK contingent, including the Reservoir Gods emerge, and 
it  is soon back to a party routine of theatrical  bickering,  smoking, 
and  half-working on competition entries that don't quite come off.  In 
the  case  of the artists and musicians,  deadlines approach  ominously 
(13.00hrs.)  In  the  case of MSG,  more ominously than  most,  as  his 
planned  musical  entry to the four channel Protracker  competition  (a 
tune  named 'RG-ology') is far too long for the two and a  half  minute 
time  limit.  MSG  grabs  a half-smoked butt-end of  triumph  from  the 
ashtray  of  defeat by his fingertips,  with an entry grabbed from  the 
'dead'  folder and spruced up a bit for the competition.  This goes  on 
to, well, you'll find out later!
 
 The  other  source  of 'entertainment' revolves around  Moondog  as  he 
parades  a section of PC demos for the masses of the TNB  room.   These 
come in a selection of styles. There are smart 3D demos with squillions 
of  polygons and texturing that looks a lot like the sort  of  textures 
used in Quake, there are Bladerunner-style movie like flybys, greetings 
to hundreds of crews that I've never heard of before,  or are likely to 
see  again.  There are also demos 'in the style of an MTV rock  video', 
which is pretty much most of them,  there are even demos that run under 
Windows,  in  a  window,  multi-tasking,  which is where the distinction 
between  hard-coded  'demo',  and casually rendered  'animation'  blurs 
fatally,  in my opinion. There are also 'fake' demos, which can best be 
described as 'nearly, but not quite', in the humour department. Best of 
all, there is the compulsory 'Fatal Exception Error' endscreen on a lot 
of  productions.  Almost  a  cliche  in the  fast-moving  world  of  PC 
software?

Back  at  Res Gods HQ,  MSG fights a losing battle with the video  mode 
selector on his loaned VGA 'Red-Green' screen.  Also the glue is coming 
off   the  sticky  tape  holding  the  old  screen  together,   so  the 
electrically vicious innards are gradually exposed.  CiH, the sellotape 
repairman  of  the  decade,  enters effortlessly to solve  the  gradual 
disintegration  problem.  he is unable to assist with MSG's Double Line 
hassles  however,  as his area of expertise is confined to the  narrow, 
but socially useful, realm of sellotape.

Lunch,  don't remember it,  but I spend the next hour or so writing the 
'Realtime  Article  DIY  construction  kit'  in  the  Maggie  realtime. 
Potentially  just a hastily written diversion from the boredom of  this 
mid-party  period,  but  in  reality,  if I get enough time,  maybe the 
answer  to  inspiration bereft producers of party-text  style  realtime 
articles!? (Well go and read the realtime if you're that keen on it!) 

I  meet,  ST Survivor,  a key member of the small French corridor-based 
contingent. They have bought loads of spiffing ST graphics, but seem to 
be  short of a coder or two?  I also get the lowdown on Toxic Mag,  not 
really a rival mag as such, more an affectionate sideways glance at the 
activities of the remaining French scene.  The (not so) shock news,  is 
that  Toxic  is  finishing after issue 17,  or at  least  ST  Survivors 
participation  in it.  Some very familiar reasons such as lack of  time 
and  contributions  from other people,  are put forward.  I  sympathise 
fully,  sometimes  a diskmag editors job is one of the loneliest on the 
scene,  especially  if you are in the early stages of a new issue,  and 
lacking  that essential 'buzz' you get from other contributors  in  the 
later stages to motivate you.

ST  Survivor  has  an ST handily placed,  which confirms  that  'Psycho 
Babble  Project',  at  least in its EIL release incarnation,  is not  a 
going  proposition.  I  curse  and spit a bit (in textual form  on  the 
Maggie realtime,  do you take me for an uncultured barbarian!) Then get 
over it.

Time wears on.  The music and graphics deadlines have closed,  time for 
musicians and artists to sit back and relax (unless they are doing last 
minute stuff for the demo entries!)

A cursory glance or two around the party reveals other activities going 
on.  Cream  are  working on a demo of their own.  It is unsure  whether 
there will be a party release or not, although Agent T's virtuoso entry 
for the graphics competition manages to grab first prize there.  In the 
same  room,  Firesoft of Switzerland,  a previously unheard of outfit, 
have  an Amiga/Falcon set-up,  and are working on a game for the  Falcy 
that  happily uses some tasty graphics from the Amiga for it.  The game 
subject  matter is kind of hard on the innocent robot  population,  but 
hey,  who cares! Also, I come across members of the Running Development 
Team  (RDT),  the people responsible for my favourite Falcon game ever. 

They  are  contributing  to  the Stax  'Rumplekammer'  entry,  and  are 
showing   the  finale  to  that  demo,   an  ST-stunning  voxel/fractal 
landscape  generator.  Even  better,  they have some original boxes for 
'Running',  and kindly provide me with a spare! This is extremely cool, 
as I only ever got a measly plastic wallet for my registered UK version 
of the game.

Cobra are also hard at work on their spectacular but slow virtual world 
entry  for  the Falcon demo compo,  but this is one I managed to  avoid 
seeing before the competitions!  Briefly glimpsed,  are Nature, and the 
latest  STinG  linked  version of 'Reekin'  Rubber,  and  the  Paranoid 
working on his EIL game, 'Reverse Pong'.

The  Swedes,  as  ever,  have got their heads down among an  impressive 
array  of hardware,  and aren't showing anything to anybody before  the 
competitions.

In  the  main  room,  MC Laser is putting the finishing touches  to  an 
elaborate  ASCII text for the tSCc/Cream combined production 'Songs  of 
Distant Earth'.  Not quite the earth-shattering team-up, you might have 
expected,  but  a  nice little farewell screen along the lines  of  'So 
long, and thanks for all the Fish?'

It  is evening,  the sort of time when big flat boxes from Amigo  Pizza 
start  to make themselves felt.  Todays Pizza is a normal 'large' size, 
and  perfectly  filling,  and nicer than the greasy chicken  and  stony 
olives conception of the first night.  Baggio falls right into the trap 
of over-ordering a 'family' pizza, and even though he is larger than me 
(no mean feat,  I can tell you!) fails to eat all of it.  A large chunk 
of uneaten Baggio Pizza kicks around the Res Gods Grotto, until a court 
order seeking its eviction is obtained by MSG!

It is also the pre-competition lull period. We are to get offerings for 
the  music  and graphics competitions later on,  but must wait  in  the 
meantime.  A lot of waiting is done in the Grotto area,  where visitors 
drop in from time to time.

One  such  interesting personage is Energiser (Harald Riegler)  of  the 
former  Falcon  mega-group  'Lazer'.  He is doing fine,  working  on  a 
Playstation  conversion  of  the Jag classic 'Iron  Soldier'.  The  new 
version  promises  to  go  a  lot further  with  the  basic  idea.  Not 
unnaturally, the conversation is dominated by 'industry' topics, but we 
do learn what happened to Lazers 'missing' final megademo on the way.

This  did  die as a result of a hard-drive crash, and the source code for 
their  DSP engine was totally lost!  Shame really,  as the demo subject 
matter  'Nature',  with  DSP generated effects such as falling  leaves, 
would have really been something to see. The surviving fragment of that 
demo,  the  'river'  endscreen in the 'Joint Venture' demo was  non-DSP 
based, and rushed to get it into that demo.

Harald  did  enter the multi-channel music competition,  coming  second 
with a neat feline-sounding entry.

Another  reason for staying right where you are rears its head,  as the 
Poles take the art of 'relaxation' to new heights. They have stocked up 
on  various  kinds of 'liquid' refreshment pre-party,  and without  the 
distraction  of  sitting down and working at  last  minute  competition 
entries, they are free to relax... Totally...

To be fair, they didn't get 'Amiga party drunk', that is, very annoying 
and in danger of causing a mini-riot. In terms of grievous bodily harm, 
or equipment harm, EIL was a very good-natured party indeed, which goes 
to show that Atari parties really are the greatest!

About   this  time,   a  new  fake  demo  entry  from  the   previously 
misunderstood  'Poets of Bombay' arrives all the way from  India?!  The 
Atari scene in Asia seems to be thriving as they use clone  derivatives 
of  common coding utilities such as 'Dysentry Packer'!  (Not to mention 
the Protracker clone 'Singh Something Simple!! (Cue groan fx!))

Eventually,  we  filter  into  the  main hall,  where the  first  party 
competition,  the music compo,  takes place.  This has entries in three 
categories,  soundchip,  Protracker  four  channel,  and multi-channel.    
Felice has left his camcorder at home,  so there are no lovingly filmed 
close-ups of tracker screens this time around!

The  soundchip entries aren't too memorable,  apart from a SID-sounding 
stormer  from  Tao.  The Protracker section is mainly memorable  for  a 
great  'last minute' entry from MSG,  and an even better one from  505, 
which  I'm  convinced  will  win  the  competition.  The  multi-channel 
competition  has  a multitude of thrills,  the most memorable  being  a 
Graoumf derived stringy tune from Energiser, and another tune that used 
the best bits of the new Flextracker program.

We  had our votesheets with us to vote for all of these.  Those  people 
who  were  forewarned  about the near-darkness of  the  room,  and  who 
brought 'glow in the dark' luminous ink with them,  were fine. The rest 
of us gave up very quickly!  The one criticism I've got of EIL,  is the 
crappy design of the votesheet,  which I made a total pig's abortion of 
trying to complete! To be fair, the organisers did re-run the music and 
graphics  competitions again the next day,  and a lot of the confusion, 
in my case at least, was probably due to the crappy design of my brain!

it  is getting nicely late,  later than the sort of (relatively  early) 
bedtimes  we've been inflicting on ourselves up to now,  and with bated 
breath,  we  await the graphics competition.  In answer to our prayers, 
this is not too long in arriving.

The  graphics  compo is divided up into ST sixteen  colour  and  Falcon 
truecolour sections.  The 16 colour leader, is a nicely erotic piece by 
Havoc,  which  is  expected to win.  For the Truecolour fans,  Agent T's 
gorgeous 'Fuji-throw' entry is ahead of a pretty good field.

These competitions over, the crowds disperse, but the party carries on.

The big screen revs up with a selection of past glories of demo-dom, by 
showing  lots of extracts of Falcon demos from the Fried Bits  III  and 
Aggressive party era.  Annoyingly cut-around, in my view, but amusingly 
so,  where the glitches were expected to pop up in the Avena Fried Bits 
entry!  When  the supply of Falcon stuff pre-recorded onto video  dries 
up,  the show goes on, with selections from the greatest hits of Amiga, 
including some very,  very state of the art stuff. (Which would require 
very,  very state of the art '060 and Power PC machines to run them,  I 
assume?)

It is about 3.00am before FXL of TNB crawls under my desk/his  sleeping 
place,  and  I  decide to do something very similar with  the  sleeping 
room.  A little bit of a surprise awaits,  as in addition to the normal 
team,  there are guest sleepers MC Laser and The Paranoid in there with 
us.  MC  Laser  is pretty much out of things already,  but Paranoid  is 
lying  there  in a sleeping bag that suggests he is fully  equipped  to 
abandon ship in it if necessary!  He explains it is an ex-army sleeping 
bag  that allows you to perform a number of tasks in it,  whilst  awake 
and moving!  Certainly,  he doesn't look like he is about to get up off 
the  floor and rev up a motorcycle here and now,  preferring the softer 
option of 'sleeping'!

As  it  is  very late,  we all agree.  The other biggie bonus  is  that 
Requiem is missing,  having opted to stay up overnight,  so no snoring! 
(At least not any snoring that disrupts the structure of the building!)

Sleep.

 Day Four, third party day, big competitions today!! 
 
Starts  quietly  like  the others,  and not too late  in  the  morning, 
which  is pretty good going,  considering the lateness of our going  to 
bed just a few short hours previously.

The  Maggie Realtime is exactly as I left it the night before,  working 
fully,  and I am pleased. My cogitation at the keyboard is FXL's wakeup 
call  too,  which I'm sure he appreciated!  Breakfast is assembled from 
the remainder of the bread and bits there, and a very large coffee gets 
me in a position to want to face the world again.

The  other  major  distraction of this early part of the  day,  is  the 
realtime  text  classic,  'German  Toilets,  a digression',  which goes 
deeply into the question of porcelainware design in different countries 
and  the fact that some German toilets seem to let you closely  inspect 
the  results of your handiwork (or should that be  'buttockwork?!)  The 
essential question being "Just why are their toilets like that?"

FXL  joins  in  with  the  fun of  the  debate,  coming  up  with  some 
surprisingly  down to earth and sensible answers to what I thought  was 
just a perverse design feature peculiar to a nation of  hypochondriacs! 
 Damn him! (Grin!)
 
As the (constantly delayed) competition deadline approaches. Some other 
'unseen' entries creep out from the darker corners of the party cellar. 
In  this  spirit,  we get to see the latest escapee from the  provision 
Dutch wing of the Vatican, the latest Nun fakedemo.

Taking a break from this red hot state of the artness, I retreat to the 
main  room where I see The Mad Butchers Atari XL in action,  running  a 
whole  bunch  of  tasty 8-Bit stuff.  We go from  a  nice  (interlaced) 
slideshow, to some more effects-laden productions, many of which aren't 
out  of  place  on much higher powered computers.  (A statement  to  be 
repeated with ever greater force later on when the ST demo competitions 
are running!)

Otherwise,  the  big  screen  offers a rerun of the badly  edited  demo 
highlights on offer the previous night.

Whilst  the entry deadlines retreat ever further back into the  reaches 
of  later afternoon,  there are some more diversions to while away  the 
time.  The  music  and graphics competitions are re-run.  I look at  my 
votesheet in daylight,  and turn away in disgust at the scribbled mess. 
A  disused  virgin votesheet lying around lonely  and  fornlorn,  doing 
nothing is 'liberated' by me for a second and mostly successful attempt 
at completion, so an apology is given to the person who might have been 
looking for their votesheet in vain!

Food  drops back into the conversation at some stage,  and Amigo Pizza, 
who  seem  to do absolutely  everything  turn their  hands  to  something 
inspired from the Indian subcontinent. What eventually came back, after 
a  very  long wait,  was something that was alright,  but bore as  much 
resemblance to real Indian food,  as a Poet of Bombay lightly fried and 
served on a Nan bread would!   (Not so much white people can't jump,  as 
can't make a decent curry?)
 
Back  in the TNB room,  one of their party is making an early departure 
(and  missing  out  on the main competitions).  FXL,  and  mixing  desk 
remains  next to me to the bitter end.  At this sort of time,  there is 
the  first  showing of the 'full' version of  'Rumplekammer',  with  it 
being  tested  on  every available ST in the room.  Except  the  Maggie 
mutant mega for some reason?!

Sensing  the  entertainment  lag  until  the  competitions  start,  the 
organisers  kick the big screen into action with a selection  of  movie 
classics  dubbed  into  the German language.  This works well  for  the 
meatheaded action thriller 'Terminator 2',  but loses it completely for 
non-germans, for the quick-witted 'Pulp Fiction'.

It is really a case of waiting for the climax of these whole four days, 
the big demo competitions, which everyone is avidly looking forward to. 
The  organisers,  typically  exceeding themselves,  circulate plates of 
Germanic party sausages. With a variety of dips, and some best Bavarian 
beer that TNB have laid on (FXL being a very nice bloke!) these go down 
very well indeed. 

In  the  French corner,  Defjam,  his main demo competition entry  long 
finished,  knocks up a crazy ASCII spinning torus. All this in spite of 
having  to cope with a French keyboard,  a species even stranger than a 
German one.

There  are  some more diversions in the main hall,  with  the  Simpsons 
having  a  large  presence on the big screen.  As these are UK  Sky  TV 
recordings in their original language,  I have no objection to these at 
all.

Time  goes  on,  the main hall slowly starts to fill up.  Maggie editor 
proves  to  be a bit of an old slyboots by grabbing one of  the  better 
seats   in  the  house,   right  by  the  video-projector,   and  given 
instructions  by one of the Checkpoint guys not to let anyone else  sit 
on that table to avoid undue projector-wobble during the  competitions. 

I have a reasonably comfortable chair, I have a table to rest my bottle 
of beer on,  I have Agent T sitting next to me.  Not quite heaven,  but 
the  best that can be done under the circumstances.  Contrast that with 
Mr Pink who had to share a very rickety bench with a dangerously bouncy 
Evil,  who  is  not  renowned for his featherlightness!  Or even  those 
people that had to jam in, when they left going to the main hall to the 
last minute.

No-one is sure which side of midnight the competitions started.  it was 
very  late,  but  everyone  in  the hall was  fully  andrenalised  with 
excited  speculation of this years entries soon to be  splashing  their 
way onto the big screen shortly.

First up,  as a starter before the main courses, are the 128 byte-tros. 
Mr Pink's entries stand out,  the one area where he had  completed some 
entries for the party. His big scrolly entry being the most technically 
interesting.  (Marks  were averaged out over the three entries,  and he 
won first prize anyway.)

A  pause for a lone 4ktro with lots of stars,  and it is on to the main 
event.

ST demos kick off with the Mystic Bytes entry. Grey was visibly nervous 
earlier,  as  the quality of a lot of the other entries became apparent 
during the final stage finishing work at EIL.  He needn't have worried, 
as  a  very smooth,  modern looking,  and polished effort,  which was a 
credit to the Mystic Bytes ran its course.  (And of course,  he pointed 
out  to me that it ran on the Falcon too where a lot of the ST  entries 
might   not.)   Lots  of  tunnels  and   subtle   plasma-warp   effects 
predominated..

Next  up was the Dead Hackers entry 'Sweety',  which was also a reprise 
of  their predominant Falcon themes (tunnels etc) on the ST.  There was 
also  a good deal of very nice static artwork in there,  and to look at 
this  and the Mystic Bytes entry,  you might think there wasn't a total 
dissimilarity of style there.

Something  different from Stax next,  the oft-discussed 'Rumplekammer'. 
This was an affectionate tribute to the olden days of demo design, with 
some  genuinely  impressive up to date effects thrown in,  such as  the 
Wolfenstein  'Penguin textured' dungeons,  the 'Mario Kart' style game, 
and the neat Voxel mountainscape from the 'Running' team.

Brilliant though all these were,  we still got the sense that they were 
only  getting  the  floor  ready  for  the  Checkpoint  record  breaker 
'Suretrip'.

To  say  that this took ST demos into new heights of  excellence  is  a 
sparse description of this singular event in demo-dom.  Defjam had been 
hoarding  and adding to his code at least since I last saw him  at  the 
Symp'  96 event,  and what I saw back then was plenty impressive!  With 
all the worrying pre-party stories of him quitting the scene a la  Tat, 
it was a profound relief to see him in action here after all.

The  demo  starts  confidently,  with crazy tunnel  effects,  and  gets 
stronger as it goes on.  We are treated to a very cool and accomplished 
3D  'Rotzoom'  that goes all over the  place,  fullscreen  (borderless) 
tunnels,  fantastic  textured cubes and bonkers feedback effects!  This 
goes  on  and  on,  surely it must finish now,  we think,  but no,  yet 
another fantastical demo effect rabbit is pulled out of Defjam's coding 
hat!

When it finally finishes,  the hall bubbles with high excitement. It is 
clear straight away where the majority of votes for the ST demo section 
are  going  to!  Surely  Suretrip  is as significant  for  the  ST,  as 
'Sonoluminescenz was for the Falcon?

Hot on the heels of this sublime moment follow the Falcon demos.  These 
start  a  little muddily,  with a last minute throw-together  entry  by 
NoCrew,  the self-proclaimed laziest demo crew in the whole world. This 
is  a  regurgitation of early Falcon slideshow  efforts.  "Multimedia", 
1993 style, with static screengrabs of 'things that make up the letters 
'EGO'.  The  majority  of the hall,  more used to an effects-rich  demo 
diet,  scratch their heads in wonder, proclaiming "Shouldn't this be in 
the fake demo section?!"

Next up,  is the 'FUN Industries' entry, the rather high energy 'Alive' 
demo.  'Alive'  it  is  too,  but not quite to its full  potential,  as 
certain  effects aren't shown to their best on the RGB  displaying  big 
screen  projector.  We  also  sense that some of the  bugs  were  still 
lurking in the background.  Still,  a creditable effort on Earx's part, 
and definitely one of the best.

Dead  Hackers throw in their entry into the ring next,  with the  'ATS' 
demo. Nothing we've not seen before, but very well presented, and apart 
from  a  last  screen bug,  very smoothly put together too.  The  final 
destination  of  that  fabulous Agent T  'Fuji-throw'  picture  becomes 
apparent too!

A 'Modest' intro from Mind Design, which is very nice, but nothing new, 
then  the  final entry to close off the Falcon demo  chapter  for  this 
event, the 'Revert' demo by Polish 3D fans, Cobra.

To say this was slow, is a major understatement along the lines of "The 
Titanic had a bit of trouble with some ice." Chugging at not much  more 
than  a  frame a second in places.  But to say it looked beautiful,  is 
also the least my descriptive powers can do.

There ended the Falcon demos. Voting was never going to be as clear-cut 
as  for  the  ST  demo category,  with something of  a  two-horse  race 
emerging in the early hours of the morning.

Fake demos follow for a bit of light relief. The Poets of Bombay 'Ibiza 
demo,  which I've had a sneak preview of,  rocks the floor with its all 
too  realistic depiction of holiday clubbing life on the sunny isle  of 
that  name.  (And  me going there for my holiday too!) Nun follow  with 
something  possibly  Vatican approved,  and there is an old TNB  'Fake' 
Nintendo  Gameboy emulator,  which would have been a really great  joke 
before  some inconsiderate person came along and actually did  one  for 
real!

Finally,  in  a  sense  of everything generally winding down,  comes  a 
varied  'Wild'  competition.  Entries start modestly enough,  with some 
musical  contributions.  They build up a little bit with a video  which 
seems  to  incorporate  some contemporary demo  effects  in  with  more 
conventional  video  editing  techniques.  In  there,  pleading  to  be 
noticed, are the Defjam 'ASCII torus', and a funny little taster screen 
for  the unfinished Cream demo 'F6 part 2',  taking 'toilet humour'  to 
new depths!

Finally,  we are treated to a preview of the brilliant 'Whip' sound-to-
light software for the Falcon,  by Escape.  This works with a system of 
plug-in  modules,  and  even  at that early  stage,  looked  absolutely 
gorgeous!  (More  on  this,  and  all of the other competition  entries 
elsewhere.)

The competitions over,  and the whole of EIL is buzzing,  the enjoyment 
crackling  just  under the surface.  Already,  some people are swapping 
those 'warez' that are available, although it was some weeks before all 
the  demos  were debugged and completed.  The relief at  the  Reservoir 
Grotty  Grotto is palpable,  at least if relief was a concept expressed 
in clouds of cigarette smoke! Some of the rest of us still have to do a 
little  bit  of work even now,  so it is off to the Maggie Realtime  to 
record my preliminary competition thoughts and impressions.

It  looks like the remaining 'remains of TNB' are trying to find  prime 
'under-table' spots to sleep in, so I leave the Maggie Realtime for the 
time being, but I don't really feel like going to bed right now.

Leaving Pink and co for a little while, I check out the Paranoid on his 
own in the Cream room,  and stop by and chat for a while.  Checking out 
his  sublimely  strange 'Reverse Pong',  a game which needs  a  certain 
amount  of lateral thinking to get into,  but it is still more playable 
than Hollandsofts 'Ping 2000'!

The  big screen has settled down again.  It is playing an early preview 
of  the unfinished Cream demo,  an effort that is bursting with bags of 
potential,  even at this early stage,  but it is clear that at the same 
time,  that there is a lot more to do with it! We look forward to this, 
as there needs to be exciting new productions for the post-EIL  period! 
 Also  missing,  according  to Requiem,  was the ST entry from Wildfire, 
which  had  its  graphics finished,  but still had a lot to do  on  the 
coding side.

 Back   to  where  the  Mystic  Bytes  are  endlessly  replaying   their 
competition  entry,  and  the  DHS  ST demo  'Sweety'.  People  chatter 
excitedly,  many have gone to bed by now,  and at this late hour, which 
may have been around 4am,  I decide to join the legions of the sleeping 
undead.

Bed,  is  where  it  always  was,  I  think of putting in  for  a  feet 
transplant when I get back home,  as I can't feel mine anymore! Snoring 
levels? Academic, as my brain fast-forwards to unconsciousness.

 Day five, final day, results, departure home and all that.. 

About five minutes later,  a knocking on the door awakens me. The first 
surprise,   it  is  Joe  Cool  warning  us  that  the  results  of  the 
competitions  are  nigh.  The  second surprise is,  that it isn't  five 
minutes later,  like my body-clock is telling me, but around 8am, which 
meant I had a whole four hours sleep! (Whoooaaah Yeah!) 

I just about make it into the main hall, where the bleary-eyed presence 
of a number of early risers (or late sleepers?) awaits the latest news. 
It  turned out to be too early for one of the tSCc guys,  who had  made 
his  bed right down by the big screen,  and rose up in front of it when 
the results were about to start!

The  results  are presented in the form of an  animated  progress  bar, 
where the winner is the one which keeps going the longest. Some results 
are pretty much in the bag. Agent T carries off the Truecolour graphics 
competition, The Reservoir Gods win the 128 byte competition, even with 
the  votes for their three entries averaged out.  Another clear  winner 
was  Havoc with his neat 16 colour entry to that part of  the  graphics 
competition.  And of course, there was never any doubt about 'Suretrip' 
winning the ST demo section!

Some  results  did have a little frisson of surprise  about  them.  MSG 
carried off the 4-channel music competition, which I didn't expect, and 
neither  did he!  The Falcon demo voting turned out to be very  closely 
run between FUN and DHS,  with DHS just breasting the tape ahead of FUN 
(it was THAT close!)

Other results included a clear win for Ibiza in the fake demo category, 
MSG  stumbling forward to collect the prize there,  and wins for 505 in 
the  multi-channel  music category,  and a well deserved win for  Falke 
Buttner (the video) in the wild compo.

I  try  to  wake  up properly,  and with a last stab  at  the  realtime 
article, and breakfast to hand, thoughts gradually turn to going home.

I divert myself by waiting for the others (Requiem and Felice) to rise, 
adding  to  the Undercover Realtime article,  and talking with  various 
people.  I  get into a conversation with Joe and some of the other more 
local party attendees about 'where they were when the wall came  down!' 
Felice emerges,  then Requiem, some time later. We are packed, and with 
transport  to  the airport arranged.  Loke,  is to come with us to  the 
airport  to  catch a flight of his own.  He proves to be invaluable  in 
passing an otherwise tedious hour at Dresden airport.

As  midday staggers near,  we bid farewell to the remaining EIL people. 
Our transport to the airport is a very kind friend of Joe Cool,  with a 
sensible  car that can take the four of us,  plus luggage.  The cobble-
strewn ride back to the airport is quick, the wait around for the first 
of  our flights a bit less so.  At least waiting with Loke makes things 
bearable.  Loke  goes,  then  we are left to ourselves.  Eventually our 
flight is called.

The  journey  back,  is  like the journey there,  but in  reverse,  and 
without the noisy pre-teens,  but with a huge Japanese family occupying 
the  mid-section of the plane instead.  Even the arrival at Heathrow is 
more  or  less  on time.  Ring Nicky from the airport to tell  her  I'm 
coming back,  answerphone replies.  We part company, Requiem and Felice 
looking for their coaches, me off to catch a train.

Ring Nicky at Euston,  get the answerphone,  leave a message, worry. Go 
to find my train.  It gets darker,  time goes on. Arrive at Northampton 
station, Nicky is nowhere to be seen....

As I am just about to pick up the phone there, Nicky bursts through the 
doors,  somewhat  overjoyed  to see me again.  The EIL adventure is now 
well  and truly over,  and what happens next,  after a long hot soak in 
the bath back at her place, well, I'd better end the text right here!

 Some final thoughts on Error in Line.. 

Well what a party that was!

It  was the perfect party in all ways.  We were treated to some of  the 
best  demos  and the most thrilling competitions of any  recent  coding 
party.  It  was cool in the extreme to meet the 'movers and shakers' of 
the  Atari  demo scene.  The organisation was brilliant,  certainly the 
best  of  any  party  I've been to.  (Comparing with  the  pretty  good 
organisation  of  last  year's ALT Party,  and also the  somewhat  limp 
efforts on the part of the 1996 Symposium.) We were really  wonderfully 
looked  after  by Joe and the rest of the Checkpoint  crew,  and  their 
friends.  A big vote of thanks should have already gone to the selfless 
female volunteers on the counter,  who were seemingly there twenty four 
hours a day! 

The Atari community is one of the friendliest and most neighbourly,  it 
is  said.  I certainly found that when sharing a room with The  Naughty 
Bytes (TNB), a group of people with whom I'd had no direct contact with 
before. Probably the coolest people in the whole of EIL, apart from the 
rest of you, of course! Thanx especially to my immediate neighbour, the 
man with the mixing desk, FXL!

The competitions pointed to the tons of hard work and dedication  still 
around on the Atari scene.  This was Defjam's moment of glory, and well 
deserved too.  He became the 'King of Coders' on a suddenly revived and 
very strong ST Scene.  The Falcon side of things was sorely missing the 
skills  and insight of Tat.  It showed here,  where the entries were of 
high  quality,  but none of them quite reaching the sublime heights  of 
'Sono'.  On  the  other hand,  straws in the wind blew all the way to a 
preview of the excellent 'Whip' sound to light software.

On  a lesser note,  this was probably the best rested I've ever been at 
an event of this sort,  Requiem generated sound effects aside! I didn't 
need to repeat the ALT Party 'No sleep marathon' as the sleeping  place 
provided was rather good!

Amigo Pizza, there may be a little debate on the quality of their food, 
but  at  least they could fill you up,  and,  alright,  it was  generally  
good.  There  were  three of us caught out by ordering  'Family'  sized 
pizzas,  two  of  us the night before the party opened,  and Baggio,  of 
course! 

I'm  still not wholly convinced aboyut FXL's explanation for  the  'Poo 
Stopper Shelf' on a lot of German porcelainware!

This was probably the greatest party of recent years for the  followers 
of the Fuji.  Those  older  folk on the Atari scene,  soup dribbling into 
their beards, may remember such events as Megaleif, STNICC, or even the 
Fried Bits with greater affection, but if you want a clear and positive 
statement of fun and commitment in the present day,  then Error in Line 
was the event to be at!

Or as MSG might have said, "Heeeeyy!"
