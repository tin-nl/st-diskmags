 
                     ‰Centurbo 2, the Final Chapter?
 
This little piece has been written as a necessary follow-up to the main 
review  in this issue of Maggie.  We thought that we had caught all the 
bugs  back then,  but it turned out there were one or two of the little 
sods scurrying around still!  Maybe this time,  the hardware fix 'Roach 
Motel' has finally done the business? - CiH
 
It is the morning of Saturday,  the 13th November 1999, south London. A 
newly-arrived  Frenchman  fidgets impatiently with  a  soldering  iron, 
conscious  that  time is getting very short.  Shortly,  the convoy from 
System  Solutions premises is heading to Stafford,  and this job has to 
be finalised before then....

A fair bit later, that same morning.

Stafford,  a big hanger somewhere.  Keyclicks ring out filling the cold 
still morning air.  On the Maggie stand, a big box suddenly arrives. We 
open it,  a mixture of fear and hope well up. Is this the final chapter 
in  the extended Centurbo 2 story?  Can we dare to hope that this time, 
it's working alright?

Well,  looking back at that day,  and the following few days after, the 
signs  are very good.  I'm still waiting to hear exactly what  Rodolphe 
did to get this errant upgrade to work.  Still, if the original creator 
of the CT2,  and resident genius of Centek can't sort it, then who can? 
I'm sure that there was more to it than just  replacing the DSP  static 
RAM, which was what I've been told was done?

The good news is now,  that the DSP is working, and has stayed working, 
even with the machine switched on for a long time.  We verified that by 
giving 'Whip!' a very thorough going-over at the ACC Show at  Stafford. 
Also, Aniplayer kept its end up, without showing a DSP hang-up once.

Further  experimentation  with  various DSP  dependent  software,  from 
Graoumf  to  'Running'  all  came up  okay.  The  general  patterns  of 
behaviour   described  in the main review still  apply,  possibly  with 
Graoumf being a little more stable than before.

The even better news is that the serial port/modem bug at 50 mhz  seems 
to have been beaten at last!  I persisted with the 'old but reliable at 
16  mhz' STinG installation that I started with,  although it might  be 
worthwhile  to  try an upgraded version at some point.  CAB,  always  a 
tricky  subject,  started to cooperate as well.  A newer OVL file might 
well have helped here too.

(Stupid things to do of an evening, part 1... I tried web browsing at a
1024  x  768  (256  colours) screen mode.  Don't  know  why,  the  text 
visibility for smaller characters is retina-busting on my screen, which 
is  only really meant for 800 x 600 un-interlaced.  After that,  things 
get a bit fuzzy. The point is though, it kept on going!)

CAB does brighten up with the extra speed, and is a lot more responsive 
and easier to get on with,  especially when things like picture loading 
and  depacking  are going on.  It is now possible to scroll down a  web 
page whilst the page is still loading.  Those frustrating 'sticky page' 
episodes  are  now a thing of the 16 mhz past.  For smaller pages  with 
less   elaborate graphics,  the load/depack time is near-instantaneous. 
For larger pages, still a lot quicker than on an unexpanded machine. At 
times,  the worst delay can come from the (lack of) connection speed to 
the internet, especially at busy times!

I  did try the 'Running' test,  and what was intended as a five  minute 
session,  just  to  see if it was okay there,  turned into a  half-hour 
plunge  into level two (the office),  before I realised it was gone 1am 
in the morning! The fact that I'd got stuck on a bit of the level where 
the  only  obvious exit was at ceiling height,  and I couldn't  go  any  
further had nothing at all to do with my pulling the plug and going  to 
bed!

I've now got a working WAD file,  and Patrice Mandin's 'Doom' port does 
work on this.  In fact,  a CT2 is really strongly recommended for this, 
as  it  is a non-DSP based 3D engine,  and slug-slow on  an  unexpanded 
Falcon.  You  might  like  to check out the review of  v0.21  for  more 
information.

Out  of  the ones that I tried the first time around,  Rainbow Paint  2 
still refused to have anything to do with 50 mhz.  Strange really, that  
Katherine Ellis reported this as working okay on turbo?  Also, there is 
still a b-i-i-i-g question mark over 'Steel Talons', as this works, but 
then goes on to experience regular hang-ups.  There is some DSP code in 
there, judging  by the presence of an *.LOD file, but it is unlikely to 
be  anything  to do with the 3-D updating?  Strange then,  that the one 
production  that uses 'dirty' DSP code comes direct from an Atari  Corp 
sponsored production!  Update - this game is okay, but only on the lower 
16 mhz mode after all.
 
Oh  yes,  there is the first major game failure on the system to report 
as  well.  The  Arkanoid  game for the Falcon,  'Impulse',  crashes  or 
freezes  as  soon  as  it  gets  to  the  main  game  screen.  This  is 
irrespective  of whether it is turbo,  or non-turbo mode.  I don't know 
how  it performs on other CT2 systems?  (Impulse checked out okay on my 
Nemesis Falcy, so that's how I know it failed here.)

The bad news?  Not a lot really,  I did notice that the 'B' drive in my 
Desktopper case had gone down,  but that is a very minor inconvenience, 
compared with all the other gains, so I'll forgive Rodolphe that one!

So, what have we learned from this long and winding tale?

1.  System  Solutions  have stuck by this right until the end,  and  my 
deepest  thanks go out to them for their efforts on my behalf.  Surely,  
the temptation must have been there to shrug their corporate shoulders, 
and  give  it up?  I don't know how other people have fared,  but  this 
makes me personally more confident of buying from them in the future.

2.  Taking 1. above as typical, you can forget about self-installation! 
There seem to be reports of varying success for this?

3. When it works, it is brilliant! The idea of a 'Super Falcon '030' is 
closer  than  ever.  Compatibility is better than I expected it to  be, 
even  in difficult areas like games and some demos.  Something like the 
Afterburner  or forthcoming (when?) Tempest accelerator may  have  more 
power,  but  you  are considering these less as a Falcon enhancer,  and 
more as an upgrade to a generic GEM box high-spec Atari compatible. The 
Afterburner  is not noted for its DSP support,  we don't know that much 
about the Tempest as yet.

4.  The main review text viewpoint remains valid. It is really a catch-
up  exercise  to  compensate for Atari Corps lack of  interest  in  the 
Falcon.

5. But what a catch-up exercise!

That's it.
