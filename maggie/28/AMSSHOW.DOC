
   ‰The All Micro Show and Atari Computing Convention, Nov '99 Edition!
 
  A quick(ish) report... 

Those of you who have still got Maggie 27 littering their desktop  will 
have  read  the  report from the 1998 All Micro Show  (AMS)  and  Atari 
Computing Convention (ACC).

In  it,  we proclaimed a brave new world of multi-format computer shows 
embracing  everything from the stubbornly 8-Bit,  and damn proud of the 
fact,  Einstein,  right  through  to  the  latest Wintel wash  'n  wipe 
Disposa-ware.  In  between  all  of this,  was the bewitching world  of 
Atari.

Now,  a year later,  a return visit by assorted Maggie Team members (me 
and Felice) finds things similar to last year,  but strangely different 
at the same time?

Firstly, those absentees, or missing in action....

Floppyshop are no more,  their appearance last year was their swansong, 
intended  to get rid of their business ties to the Atari  community.  I 
remember  picking up a certain item from their stand,  which did make a 
reappearance this year!

Titan  didn't  make  it either.  Personal commitments meant  that  Dave 
Encill couldn't show.  Pity really,  because at least a few people were 
interested in the forthcoming 'Tempest' accelerator.

16-32 must have sold the last of their Amiga A1200s,  going at 40 ukp a 
throw at the Spring '99 show. So they didn't turn up either.

The  people  that did turn up,  managed to paper over the  holes  quite 
well.

Most  significant  sighting of the day was to be found  on  the  System 
Solutions  stand,  right in the corner of the hall.  A real live Phenix 
motherboard  had made it to the show!  One of the designers,  Roldolphe 
Czuba,  had  also  turned up as well.  His role in my enjoyment of this 
show  was very important for quite another reason,  more on which a bit 
later.

Phenix  looked neat,  looked quite petite for the sort of power  levels 
involved, a real hardware fetishists dream, in fact. Where we are still 
in a 'jury out' situation,  is seeing it running some software,  as the 
bootstrap was only showing a black and yellow chessboard to the waiting 
world! Now if they could get it to zoom back and forth?

Sys Sols were also debuting as the new distributors of Calamus SL, with 
the latest version, complete with its newly printed English manual.

It was a pre-millenium farewell for the 'Atari Computing' magazine. the 
final  issue  (no  16) was being handed out to  those  subscribers  who 
turned up,  way ahead of the 'official' January posting out date.  This 
will be their last time here,  at least in a formal capacity. Watch out 
for a bunch of suspicious but strangely familiar blokes in Fuji  chain-
gang attire passing sarcasm over next years efforts!?

Next up,  was Chris Crosskey of ASP, in his winter hairstyle (very long 
and bushy!) He was mainly showing ST-IDE interfaces,  and the ultra-new 
PC  AT Keyboard to Atari interface.  This lets you interface any PC AT-
style  keyboard  and  PC mouse to a bog-standard  TOS  Atari  computer, 
especially  those ones suffering from mushy Atari Corp issue cheap  and 
nasty horrors.  I didn't pick one up at the show,  but maybe one for my 
Xmas list?

Next  door  to Atari Computing,  one-time deadly rivals  'ST-Plus'  are 
present.  They  were  represented by AtariMad and Carbon.  More changes 
have  hit ST-Plus,  as it has now gone to being a HTML-based  magazine, 
and  some people previously involved with the running of it,  have gone 
their  separate ways.  It was great to see these two again,  and it was 
also interesting to see that they had the only real-time article in the 
hall. (Ours failed to turn up with Matt Smith's non-arrival!)

The biggest bargains of the day,  were down to the Console Centre,  who 
were  selling Jaguars and Lynxes at an amazing (or not surprising?)  15 
ukp a throw!  You did get two free games with the Jaguar as well, or to 
put it another way,  you got Cybermorph and a free game with every Jag! 
Requiem dropped by our stand, with an armful of gear from there.

Cadenza Software were throwing out the latest version of Web Wizard, an 
'Eezi-Web  page'  authoring  package at 10 ukp.  (my  only  major  show 
purchase.) The Tyne and Wear 8-bit group, and Portfolio club were doing 
their thing (selling or reselling bits,  mainly.) Electronic Cow were a 
couple of stands away from us,  and a couple of other musically related 
groups were close by too.

Apart  from  one  'surprise entry',  which wasn't  specifically  Atari-
Related, further away in the hall, that was the Atari village. But what 
about us, I hear you cry?

Well, we had a stand there too, which was comprised of Felice's Falcon, 
my  STe,  and the imminent arrival of my,  resoldered for the umpteenth 
time,  Centurbo  2  Falcy,  the former Floppyshop machine,  which passed  
into  my  hands  at this very venue,  this time last  year!  This  duly 
arrived,  and was set up on the next (unsold because it was on a wobbly 
slope) table.

I was able to try out an idea that I had lurking at the back of my mind 
for this show.  Simply,  to 'slave' the CT2 Falcy,  running Whip! to my 
STe,  running  a  shedload  of the latest (1999 released)  demos.  This 
worked,  and worked well.  We also drew a crowd by running the 'Drunken 
Baby pissing on the path' animation under Aniplayer!

The  other  thing  I had managed to do,  was to  finally  complete  and 
release  the  one-off 'concept' maggie,  the 'Psycho  Babble  Project'. 
People had only been kept waiting since EIL,  last Easter,  so quite an 
achievement to get it out in November then!

Felice was doing his best, trying to sell off a few miscellaneous bits, 
but without a lot of success, but if Netscape Communicator is freeware, 
now, there might have been a bit of a problem there, even for 15 ukp?

People-wise,  this show was patchy. A number of regular 'names' managed 
to  stay  away  this  time.  We missed out on  any  presence  from  the 
Reservoir  Gods,  Mr Pink was confidently expected to appear,  but even 
the promise of the Phenix motherboard failed to prise him out?

Two people who were expected at the show,  but didn't make it, were Kev 
'Taff'  Davies,  and  Matt  Smith.  The  non-appearance of  the  latter 
especially  mysterious,  as  he was supposed to be taking the time  off 
specially, and probably joining us on the stand.

We  did get Requiem and assorted friends,  and my enduring memory is of 
us  treating  them to a showing of the 'Suretrip'  megademo,  with  Req 
exclaiming "Hey, crazy stuff going down in 8mhz dudes!"

There  was a scene-based arrival,  with Spiny of Torment dropping in to 
put some faces to the 'Maggie Team' label. We also got into a rich seam 
of contact with a cool person called Rob Goldsmith,  who turned up with 
a nice Nemesis boosted Thing!  desktopped Falcon,  who was next to ASP. 
It  turned out that he was working on what well may become a new  Atari 
TOS-based Web Browser!!

This  will be known as 'HighWire'.  It is intended to be freeware (more 
exclamation marks?) and is already optimised to run about twice as fast 
as  CAB.  (even more exclamation marks!) The bad news,  at least at the 
moment, is that it has only got  to the state of an offline HTML 2 text 
displayer.  How  much  further  it gets from there does depend  on  the 
amount  of  time  that a third year degree course will  allow?  Not  to 
mention  Robs  prior  commitments to helping  out  with  Zetnets  Atari 
support.

Needless to say, I was offering my services as the 'official' CT2 beta-
tester!  We  hope  that this will get a lot further,  as CAB appears to 
have got stuck, and seems to be officially staying that way.

One  person,  whom we would never have expected to turn up,  not whilst 
Atari Computing was in the same building, was discovered lurking on the 
Cyberstrider  stand.  This was set up well away from the Atari  masses, 
and was easily the most corporate looking effort in the whole hall.  It 
was there that we found Tony Greenwood!

He  looked  the  same as ever,  sounded the same too,  but  apart  from 
volunteering  the  fact  that he was mostly doing web  design  for  his 
Paxton Web operation, kept to himself.

Information  from some third parties suggested that he wasn't too  keen 
to be known by his former 'nom de code' "Stosser" anymore!

He  apparently did take a spin around the assorted Atari stands,  but I 
must have been out at the time, and didn't see him again.

As for the rest of it?

Well  the  box shifters were in the same spots as  before,  'Back  Door 
Beauty' Seedy-ROM's fighting for space with circuit testers,  'amazing' 
deals for various vintages of PC hardware. Amazing, that is, unless you 
were  in the ranks of the truly indifferent.  We would assume that  the 
reseller  of the ex-Gwent County Council BBC Micros,  found a new  home 
for them in a waste skip?

And talking of 'waste skip'... No, that's too cruel a link!

The  Einsteins  were back in force (both of them).  I even picked up  a 
freebie issue of their club magazine (last years Xmas edition).

Browsing  through  this confirmed my suspicions that this was  a  scene 
which  was  heavily  into things like facial hair,  dressing  up  as  a 
railway  guard  in  full GWR livery whilst  playing  with  their  model 
trains, and bemoaning the fact that things weren't as good as they used 
to be, and would probably be a lot worse tomorrow.

The one thing that proved to be just that little bit scarier was the QL 
user group!

Unlike  the Einstein group,  which stuck to a rigid pre-planned  agenda 
but   without  much  heat  or  light  showing,   there  seemed  to   be 
undercurrents  of 'things' happening on the QL stand.  Apart from  some 
Lego-Technic  figurines spasmodically twitching,  according to the whim 
of  a freshly interfaced controlling QL,  it was hard to tell what  was 
going on exactly?

QL  appreciation  seems to be a covert business,  conducted  in  hushed 
whispers.  You  sensed  that  there were  potentially  exciting  things 
stifled in the library-like atmosphere. The QL '040 upgrade, a pamphlet 
last year, is now actually living hardware, but the only thing I saw of 
it,  was someone attempting to load a disk,  and the screen locking up! 
Where the Atari people were actually *doing* things, it seemed that the 
QL stand, was just people talking about 'stuff', but it wasn't clear at 
any time to the uninitiated, what the 'stuff' was about!?

Clearly, their showmanship skills are sadly lacking?

I said at the time "If I ever get this bad,  then shoot me!" but then I 
had to move quickly to get Carbon and AtariMad to put their guns away!

The show wears on to the afternoon, Centurbo 2 Falcy stays on working,
which  makes me happy.  Rodolphe pops his head around the corner,  sees 
what  is  happening,  and looks relieved!  We manage to skirt carefully 
around the whole 'Balcony Cafe equals expensive food' issue by bringing 
our own food. This had the benefit of keeping more money for the apres-
show visit to the 'Saracens Head'.

Felice, the wild and crazy Mullerice fanboy, forgot his bag-splattering 
EIL fiasco, and brought some with him. This remained uneaten?

Other entertainment included 'racing' my CT2 and Rob's Nemesis  system. 
(The  CT2  wins,  even with a substantial head start for the  Nemesised 
machine, with both running the DHS Orneta classic 4k demo '4ever'!)

By  the  time I get around to inviting the Cadenza crowd  over  to  our 
stand, Felice has started unplugging things and packing up.

It was a short trip to the after-show venue, the 'Saracens Head' Public 
House.  We  are  first,  Carbon  and AtariMad soon follow,  then  Chris 
Crosskey.

Apres-Show instructions:- "Whatever you do,  DON'T mention 'Robot Wars' 
to  Chris  Crosskey..."  (We're already way  too  conversant  with  the 
cutting properties of hardened steel spinning disks as it is!) 

With  the  arrival of the (ex?)Atari Computing Team,  there is quite  a 
roomful,  which  sort  of staggers over to the restaurant and orders  a 
meal, a bit later on.

Eventually, we leave, it is possibly the end of an era?

 Summing up...

 This format is getting stale again.  It loses out in comparison to last 
year,  when everything was fresh and new,  and there seemed to be a lot 
more going on. If you know where the main stands are, and what they are 
selling, then you know that the novelty has definitely worn off.

Scratching  beneath  the downbeat presentation,  the 'people' side  was 
still  doing fine,  even with some notable,  and much missed absentees. 
Where  Atari's are gathered in reasonable numbers, there will always be 
someone you  can enjoy talking to!

Generally,  a  big  re-think as to how this can work,  in a  post-Atari 
Computing sense, is needed before the next one?


 Spring Show postscript sort of thing:-

 There was a Spring Show,  in April,  a couple of weeks or so after EIL. 
We didn't take a stand that time, and this was more of a 'me and Nicky' 
visit.  Mr Pink and MSG did turn up to that one,  but only very late on 
in  the day.  I did get the official English version of the  megamighty 
Jinnee Desktop there.

There  was also an attempt to visit the aforementioned 'Saracens  Head' 
public house, but the mighty Atari Computing organisational team forgot 
it  was closed on a Sunday!  (Pause for mass slapping of foreheads  and 
cries of "DOH!")

AtariMad had a spot of car trouble,  it rained,  heavily. Felice wanted 
to go home quickly, Felice and AtariMad aren't the best of buddies now.  

That was about it.
