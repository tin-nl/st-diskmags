                      Sound to light for the Falcon
                                by Escape

This  little baby first emerged at last Easter's Error in  Line  coding 
party in the 'Wild' competition.  We thought,  "Hey wow!" but seriously 
wondered if we'd ever see it get out into open country?

Fortunately,  Norman/No  of  Escape relented,  and here is version 0.3, 
fixed  for VGA monitors,  at least those monitor tubes that are able to 
manage 100HZ?

Very very simply,  Whip!  takes an external audio source fed in through 
the  handily available microphone socket on the back of the Falcon.  It 
reads it through the DSP matrix,  and makes an effect on screen, chosen 
from  the  crateload now available,  move around in time to the  music. 
Then the audio is spat back out through the headphone audio/out socket.

The basic operation of Whip! thus described is extremely uncomplex, but 
of course, there is a bit more to it than the paragraph above. There is 
a lovely custom interface, slider bars and all, done in a gorgeous arty 
'far away from bland GEM as possible' style.  Functionally, it is split 
into slider bars on the left for input and output values, with a simple 
oscilloscope to see how you're fine-tuning. There is also an option for 
the sad and desperate, internal speaker on/off!

On the right,  is where the major action takes place, as there are menu 
selectors for the range of individual effects loaded into the  program. 
(As VLM modules,  more of which in a minute.) Below that, is a sub-menu 
to control parameters of the module presently running.  There is also a 
randomiser  (with  adjustable timer) for those fans of  slideshow  type 
multimedia  displays.  And of course,  you can choose which VLM modules 
you  want  up there on the screen,  and those which are staying out  of 
things today.

With  the  three  effects seen at EIL,  and with  the  additional  ones 
supplied  by  Escape when they released Whip!,  this was a bloody  good 
product. Going for an add-on module format, means that the Whip! system 
can  be added to indefinitely.  The next really good idea of Escape was 
to release details of how the VLM format could be programmed. This gave 
all  sorts  of third party programmers a leg up,  and we saw a wave  of 
early summer 'Whip-Mania' consume the Atari nation!

Contributors as diverse as Earx/Fun, NoCrew, and even DHS got involved, 
all  reprising favourite demo effects in VLM.  How could be do  without 
the famous DHS tunnel strutting its funky stuff in time to the beat  on 
whip?  The clear winner,  in this mad race to get the most over the top 
effect possible,  is NoCrew,  with their 'Whip-pong' VLM.  Basically, a 
pong  game  which can be 'played' with two mono  microphones  into  the 
stereo  source,  and  the players shouting at the bat to move,  or just 
letting  the  music 'play for you!  A real crowd-pleaser,  or  stopper, 
depending on your point of view.

Another  way  of  looking  at Whip!,  is of course a  cunning  plan  to 
introduce  commonplace  demo  effects to unsuspecting  members  of  the 
public! If you can somehow listen to your favourite CD through it, then 
Whip! magically becomes elevated beyond the 'waste of time downloading'  
view  of  normal demos that a lot of non-scene people have.  It can  be 
described as working like a sugar-coated pill in that case!

A  short review like this doesn't really do justice to seeing Whip!  in 
action.  I'm not sure whether it can be called a 'utility', as there is 
very little 'usefulness' in a production like this.  However, if you're 
showing off at a large public venue, with a suitably large screen, then 
be  prepared  to  knock  out the crowds  of  gawping  PC  owners  drawn 
magnetically to you. (And steal their wallets!)

It works on Centurbo 2 as well. Just thought you'd like to know that!
 

 Advantages..

Infinite possibilities for third party adding on 
Enthusiastic take-up by Atari Scene!
Great for showing off!
Makes demo effects user friendly!
Seems to be accelerator friendly? 

 Disadvantages..
Well, none really!
