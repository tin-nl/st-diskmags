 ...Fit the following... 

Hittfeld, Easter 1996, a young coder sits at a well-used Mega ST, he is 
painfully young, and unknown to me. That was to change.

His  ST threw out effects by the barrel-load,  all of them more  likely 
seen on the big brother Falcon '030, all of them brilliant and bursting 
with potential, even at that early stage.

This young coder was one of the most singularly dedicated people in the 
hallway,  working until he dropped,  literally,  pulling off one of the 
epic  'sleeping  on  the  keyboard' sessions.  (This was  also  a  feat 
accomplished by Tat, and we all know how well he turned out!)

Years  pass,  we  can put a name to this young talent,  he is known  as 
Defjam,  the group he is in,  Checkpoint, throw out the odd interesting 
production,  if nothing really,  really,  earth-shattering.  But by the 
time the narrative timeskips to the Easter of 1999, and a map reference 
somewhat  further east than before,  it becomes apparent what has  been 
building and is about to explode onto an unsuspecting Atari scene.

So is this demo any good?  ;-)

'Suretrip' is an interesting hybrid,  a thoroughly modern demo, with an 
old style exterior. It comes as a disk image, which has to be fashioned 
into  a bootable disk,  putting it straight in the territory of greying 
classics  such  as the Union Demo,  Mindbomb,  etc.  This also tends to 
mostly  rule  it  out  for  the more  recent  Atari  models,  the  F030 
especially.  (I  say  'mostly',  as  some of it can run  under  certain 
conditions, more of which a bit later.)

Well, enough preliminaries, time to get down to the demo itself....

We are told,  right at the start,  that this isn't a complete demo,  in 
fact, it is the 49% version! Oh yeah!

We  start with black,   and nothing else but a self-confident  chipzik.
This  minimalist approach to the  demo makers art is soon dispelled  by 
a  logo and series of credits on the right hand side,  and some tunnel-
based action on the left of the screen.  This is lovely orange textured 
and sectioned bits of tunnel,  which then swap to the other side of the 
screen,  then up or down, as it pleases. The  credits rapidly disposed, 
of, the tunnel then goes all wobbly.

Soon,  left alone to itself, it manages to fill the rest of the screen, 
the  sections split off further,  the dark gaps fill up with a  totally 
unrelated   effect,   the   famous  'ULM'  wobbly  dense-layered   mini 
scrolltexts,  which  works  better  than  it  sounds,  and  is  a  real 
demonstration of the coders art.

The  second  part is soon upon us,  with new  buzzy-sounding  soundchip 
music and some cute multicoloured splitting and rejoining plasma blobs. 
This is a quick bit,  and is nice, but not a technical tour-de-force, a 
quick logo squeezes in there.

Change of screen again, ah, this looks promising...

A  very well drawn sixteen colour female face portrait,  in bright  but 
tasteful  colours,  and  making the best of the ST lo-res screen  mode. 
Quite attractive on its own,  and surely the highlight of many a lesser 
production, for the 'presentation' or 'design' part, if not the coding.

We sit up a bit more, when it starts to zoom out, revealing a border to 
border  'wallpaper',  which  then  starts to move in a rapid  'zoom  n' 
rotate' motion.  It manages to stay full colour,  and mananges to avoid 
the  lumpy  and  chunky look of earlier zoom and rotators  on  the  ST. 
Defjam  manages to top even this,  with something that looks a lot like 
an  ST  version  of motion blur!  This is another  high  quality  coded 
screen, justly lending this demo its 'revolutionary' label.

Same  theme,  different  graphics,  a lesser-looking purple-ish graphic 
repeated ad-infinitum. This shows off an angled 'wall' and 'floor', and 
does its stuff authentically in three dimensions.

We may have seen Defjams first attempt at that effect,  as he cranks up 
the prettiness factor with a nicely coloured abstract logo. This spins, 
rotates,  and  after  a  while,  the concepts of 'floor' and  'ceiling' 
become totally meaningless. 

A quick pause before the next chapter, a gratuitiously sexist (but hey, 
who cares!) still picture of a fantasy model with an overlarge  chestal 
area!

Part three, or is it four? 

At this point,  we lose the Falcon.  By way of explanation, I *did* try 
to run this demo on a Falcon,  using 'Backwards',  just to 'see how far 
it would go',  which was quite a good way in,  all things considered. I 
know it really ins't a Falcon demo, but can you fault me for making the 
attempt.  A  more sensible counsel suggests that my STe really would be 
better taking over at this point.

The reason for non-Falcon-ness soon becomes apparent,  with an ancient, 
but still wicked AN Cool sample, from the Cuddly/Union? demo. This soon 
adds in my personal favourite bit of the whole demo, which are.... 

   …Gorgeous fantastic fullscreen borderless texture tunnels!!!!  

Yes,  Defjam  really  killed off *all* the borders.  The tunnels  glide 
onward, assured, then they reverse direction, then the tunnel blurs and 
changes colours, enging up an appealing fiery red. Before too long, the 
music slows and then stops. 

As I said,  this was my personal favourite part of the whole demo,  and 
must have taken some truly crazy hardware bashing coding to get it  all 
to work!

Another  light relief moment,  a comedy picture of a coyote staring  at 
his  tail  on the other side of the screen,  as if reality came with  a 
faulty wraparound?

Part, oh, I've lost count by now!

This is a kind of 3D bumpmap with a large and fancy scrolltext over it. 
The  text  is also taking up the light and shade  complexities  of  the 
bumpmapping  then  it rotates!  Very reminiscent of a couple of  French 
Falcon demos, can't think of which one at the moment.

Next  bit  is  a 'Heart-tunnel' effect,  which is very  DHS  in  style. 
Distorts and reforms like mad,  goes on for a bit. Very nice, but a bit 
like  the blobs earlier,  an appetite-whetter for the next coding  big-
hitter sensation.

We do get a brilliant mOdmate 'babe-face' portrait to follow, then ever 
onwards.

The  next part is more of a coders screen.  A 3D rotating tunnel,  in a 
pseudo-texture style,  an elaborate coarse resolution green vector neon 
look.  Not pretty,  but by gum, it does the job. In fact, it manages to 
reprise  the DHS 'Dream Dimension' spinning on all axis tunnel  on  the 
ST!  Without a maths co-processor either!  It soon changes colour,  and 
gradually goes from a vector thing, to something more solid.

Another  theme-change,  a  change of music again,  this one comes  with 
digi-drums.

A  huge  text  scroller start in on the screen,  to begin with,  it  is 
angular,  dull and lifeless.  It retreats off the left hand side of the 
screen.  Suddenly,  it  cheekily  re-appears,   ablaze in a purple haze! 
Soon,  Defjam,  has this rotating and zooming like a mad thing. Careful 
observers  note that this virtually manages to kill the screen  borders 
as well.

A spinning vector cube follows, in the same fiery style. the cube sides 
bend  and  distort.  it is a stretchy elastic cube?  We sense that this 
screen  was created from the programmers own enjoyment and  indulgence, 
these  kind of vector flame effects being a previous Defjam  favourite. 

Then  a  huge  multi-line 3D grid-thing (Best  description  I  can  do, 
sorry.)  lumbers  on,  finally,  we get a hexagonal vector torus  which 
buks out to be larger than the screen.

Change  the record,  a slightly SID sounding tune.  Then on to the next 
part.

The portrait face seen in the earlier zoom and rotate comes back  here. 
This time,  it is a spin and distort 'Obnoxious demo',  washing machine 
distorter,  managing  to  be  quick,  and  maintain a decent  pixel  to 
complexity of effect ratio. 

Then  a  Checkpoint logo and Atari fuji fade in,  spinning  and  gently 
distorting.  This  section is another technically strong piece of  work 
from the 'sleep, only if forced to' Defjam.

The end is near, and Defjam is saving his best to last.

A series of plain red vertical raster bars appear.  Nothing else doing? 
you  think.  A small speck of dots gathers in the centre of the screen, 
soon resolving into a textured cube.

This  comes with various effects playing on it,  first seen one by one, 
then when the cube spins, you see all of these running on the different 
surfaces!  These  are reprising many of the effects seen earlier in the 
demo,  swirling tunnels,  cojoining blobs, distorting ladies, and more. 
All  solid,   and  all  going  like  the  clappers!  In  realtime,  and 
unoptimised, according to the man himself!

You  might remember that Polski maestros,  Syntax,  have done the solid 
moving  textured cube thing on the ST before,  but don't count this out 
at all.

Suddenly,  it  is  not  enough for the cube just to  spin,  the  raster 
background  is thrown to one side,  and a  crazy swirling feedback kind 
of thing take over.

This isn't so much a neat precise effect, more a scream of pure delight 
from Defjam, that the demo is over!

It is,  but not until the fat Carebear sings? 'Being a carebear takes a 
lot  of skill' spits back,  and some M-Demo tribute bars slam down  the 
screen.

One  final tasteful prize,  a delightfully nude-themed female study  by 
mOdmate,  nothing  in  there to offend anyone at all (I'm actually  not 
being  ironic  for  a  change!)  with  the  legend  beside  it  'To  be 
continued'.

Oh, we do hope so!

So to come back to my earlier question, yes, this demo is very good.

Some will even say 'best ever' for the ST!

It certainly had the right impact at the Error in Line convention  last 
Easter, carrying off the top spot. We waited long enough for it, and we 
weren't disappointed at all. 

Looking  at  it again,  more dispassionately,  it is nice to be able to 
pick  up  the subtle nuances of the demo,  the strong and  less  strong 
parts,  the sly 'tributes' to other famous demos,  the fact that Defjam 
managed to stuff so much onto one disk!

Truly a mega megademo!
