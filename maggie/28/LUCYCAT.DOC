 Now  very careful readers of Maggie may have heard of me  before,  that 
is,  readers of Maggie issue 2, produced back in 1990, and those humans 
who managed to get hold of the fifth birthday issue as well.

I'm  Lucy the cat,  the feline who lives at the home of CiH's  parents, 
and who puts up with lots of inconvenience in the name of duty there.

Now  you  might  think that being a cat is a bowl of  Whiskas,  with  a 
flowery  garnish on the top made of some succulent  sugary  confection, 
but I assure you, in all my years of feline wisdom, it is not!

Here  are  some  of  my top causes of aggravation,  and  I'm  sure  I'm 
speaking for many other cats when I present my own personalised list of 
life's shortcomings.
 
  Reasons to be dismal, part three....

Owners  who  forget to adjust their feeding times when the  'clocks  go 
back', as they so quaintly put it. My clock doesn't!

Dogs, 'nuff said.

On the other hand...

Big  hairy  smelly dogs with their tongues lolling  out  and  dribbling 
copious  saliva  all  over  your  favourite  chair.   These  disgusting 
creatures are often 'invited' into my home by the humans resident here, 
but they're not alright by me!
     
Dogs  that chase me a lot,  the mindless brutes.  I understand that the 
last  cat that lived with CiH and his parents was pretty nifty when  it 
came to punching those sorts of dogs in,  however,  that cat had a size 
and weight advantage over me, and a lot of dogs too, but regrettably is 
resident under the daffodils in a non-alive state now.

Tom  and Jerry,  the cat on that show is a disgrace to the whole felice 
race! Get him off the air now!

Small  children,  especially  the  ones  that  move  in  a  random  and 
unpredictable fashion, and make a lungeing grab for me.

Whoever  came  up with the idea that an acre of rain-sodden soil  is  a 
good cat toilet. Why aren't we allowed to use the proper flushing ones?

Likewise  cat litter,  fine at first,  but the odour is deadly to small 
mammals after a few days of constant use.

Humans who cut down fun to climb trees.

Most  cheaper brands of cat food (Hewk!) We know what goes  into  them, 
and don't thank you for the associated BSE risk!

Humans that aren't at the door by the third meeow.  Or the second meeow 
if it is wet outside.

Humans who expect you to be able to push open that loosely ajar kitchen 
door  by yourself,  what else are they there for,  if not to open doors 
for me?

Garfield, a good idea at first, but a tad overplayed and past it now.

The  human who insists on bundling you off the sofa when they  want  to 
sit there.

Any human with a fidgety and uncomfortable lap.

The  inventor of guitar strings!  May the cat goddess damn him for  his 
perverted ideals!

Furballs.

Projectile vomiting as a result of the above.

Fleas,  which are little sods,  the 'treatment' inflicted to get rid of 
them is even worse! You can tell it was designed by the people who pour 
corrosive liquids into laboratory animals eyes (okay if it is a captive 
dog though!) 

Dogs again, just to be sure!

So  now  you can see that life isn't all about sleeping,  eating,  more 
sleeping  in  warm  and comfortable conditions,  being  picked  up  and 
stroked by the humans you share the house with, and more sleeping. That 
is only 98% of my life, the rest is …pure hell!!
