                    ..A TRS 80 Emulator for Atari..

                            By Sander Berents

To  most  people,  a TRS 80 emulator might provoke a reaction of  "Huh, 
what?!" To those of us who have been around since the dawn of computing 
time, it may provoke a wry smile.

Well,  try and think of  T andy  R adio  S hack, or 'TRS'. Yep, it was the US 
based  discount electronics chain's early attempts to get into the  new 
and exciting home computer market back at the end of the 1970's. It can 
be  best  summed  up  as a mono competitor to  the  Apple  II,  falling 
somewhere between that and the Commodore Pet, of a similar vintage.

To  be  a little more technical about things,  it was (is) a Zilog  Z80 
based machine,  the luxurious Model III, which this emulator recreates, 
comes  with  64k of RAM,  divided up into 48k main memory,  a 14k  ROM. 
Foreshadowing more modern systems, the video RAM hasn't been forgotten, 
it has a whole 1k to itself, like the keyboard (useful for user-defined 
characters?)  This also handily emulates virtual floppy disks,  more of 
which, a bit later.

The machine had a reasonably long life,  more as a workhorse, than as a 
flashy games machine.  There were a lot of useful applications created, 
but  there was quite a good library of games,  if ZX81-esque  graphics, 
and Speccy styled sound are your 'bag'.

There  has  been  an  emulation of this vintage  system  on  Atari  TOS 
computers and compatibles,  this is where 2nd Life comes in. Written by 
Dutch  person  Sander Berents,  2nd Life sets out to be a more or  less 
complete  emulation of a disk-based Model III machine,  and at  version 
1.0, apart from one or two small details, seems to succeed.

It takes a refreshingly different approach from most emulators,  for as 
it emulates a mono system, it runs in ST High resolution to do so. This 
would also apply to VGA monitors attached to Falcons.  It will run with 
the RGB cheap and nasty 'flickerlace' version of ST high.  

It  also runs fully under GEM,  again not common or easy to accomplish, 
unless the TOS computer is a powerful one.  Amazingly,  this manages to 
run at a reasonable, if not full speed, on a standard 8mhz ST, and more 
or less full speed on a 16mhz machine,  according to the authors.  With 
something  like  a 50mhz Centurbo 2,  there is more than  enough  speed 
there!

The  emulator is divided into two onscreen parts,  the main GEM window, 
where  the  action takes place,  and a lower window where virtual  disk 
drives  (four  in all) are emulated.  Emulator options are set up  from 
normal GEM pull-down menus.

You are allowed to 'customise' the emulator in quite a lot of different 
ways,  as  you  can (somehow) emulate a simon-pure tape-based  machine. 
There are facilities and programs provided with the emulator to  enable 
physical connection between any real TRS 80 still alive out there,  and 
the emulated Atari version,  (for the transfer of programs.) The author 
sadly concluded to me that he was probably the only person likely to be 
using these, which was a shame, as he had put a lot of work in there.

There  are  other  options  to make the  emulator  more  accessible  or 
interesting.  It  is possible to turn off the GEM window,  and to get a 
totally  dark  screen area for that real retro  early  'eighties  Tandy 
feel,  or  inverse characters if preferred.  The usual monitoring tools 
within  the emulator are there,  to break into programs where you want. 
Other  options  are  there to tweak it to go a bit  better  or  faster, 
depending on your system configuration. 

It is compatible even with emulated Atari ST's, an interesting concept, 
nested emulation on three layers of computing,  PC/Mac to ST,  and then 
Tandy!  Also,  in  a  shock move for emulators,  it is also entirely co-
operative  with  MagiC,  happy  in a multi-tasking environment!  And  I 
daresay it is on speaking terms with Mint too.

In  the  end,  the  easiest  way to get it all going,  is to  click  to 
highlight the first drive icon (drive 0),  select 'load disk', and load 
in  the  'NewDOS 80' system disk,  handily supplied as a  virtual  disk 
image.  You now have a working TRS80 on your Atari Desktop! Clicking on 
one of the other drive icons lets you load in one of the other supplied 
virtual disk images, a bunch of games handily put together!

Highlights  included  a kick-ass Lunar Lander,  a clone of  the  arcade 
classic  'Scramble' with an underwater theme.  There is the  occasional 
conversion  of  something more mainstream,  with a version of an  early 
Sinclair Spectrum hit 'Moon Patrol' (or Moon Buggy?) (Yes, and a lot of 
these games were ASM language coded.) There is even the odd thing  that 
creeps  into  the  territory  of  'demo',  although  not  as  we  would 
understand  it,  with  a neat little 'Dancing Devil' screen that  falls 
perfectly into the 'scenic but useless' category.

There  is  also  a BASIC variant provided on the NewDOS  80  disk,  and 
loading  that  lets you get access to the countless .BAS  programs  out 
there.  Yet another virtual disk has stacks of these supplied, the disk 
needs to be mounted on one of the virtual drives, and your command line 
typing  skills  have to be remembered to get one of  these  loaded  and 
running.  There  is the flexibility to load in individual .BAS programs 
from the GEM file selector. If you like doing that sort of thing.

Of  the  incomplete  bits,  there  is  only  one  omission,  of  lesser 
importance,  according to the author.  You cannot format virtual disks. 
To  create a new disk image,  you have to create a copy of one of  your 
existing virtual disks, rename it and then PURGE it of all its existing 
programs. The tools supplied, which actually run within the emulator as 
TRS80  programs,  should  allow  you to  transfer  standalone  assembly 
language program files to the new disks, in theory. In practice, things 
seem  to be a bit longwinded and clumsy,  and so far,  I haven't got as 
far as making up any new disks from scratch. 

2nd Life should be able to run other disk images available from TRS  80 
internet  resource  archives,  and as the machine was sold as  an  all-
purpose computer,  with a 'useful' bias,  there should be quite a range 
of interesting, if rather old software for it out there.

I did manage to make contact with the author,  who confirmed that, yes, 
he was still out there,  and kept a distant eye on the movements of the 
Atari Scene,  but no, there weren't any new versions of 2nd Life in the 
pipeline,  or any other Atari-related projects.  He did say that a Java 
TRS80  emulator  was being created under the  'Schizoid  Design'  label 
though,  and porting the code for 2nd Life, to another portable system, 
was under consideration.

Details  and downloads of 2nd Life,  along with other news of 'Schizoid 
Design' can be found at www.schizoid.demon.nl/AtariFreak/

To  wrap  up  this short review,  2nd Life is an  extraordinarily  good 
emulation of a reasonably complex 8-Bit computer, realised on Atari TOS 
machines of modest means.
