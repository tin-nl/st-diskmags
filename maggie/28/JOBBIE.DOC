"I  am  extremely loyal to my present firm,  so please don't let  them 
know of my immediate availability." 

"Qualifications:  I am a man filled with passion and integrity,  and I 
can act on short notice. I'm a class act and do not come cheap." 

"I  intentionally omitted my salary history.  I've made money and lost 
money. I've been rich and I've been poor. I prefer being rich." 

"Note:  Please  don't misconstrue my 14 jobs as 'job-hopping'.  I have 
never quit a job."

employers." 


J OB RESPONSIBILITIES:  

"While  I  am  open  to the initial nature  of  an  assignment,  I  am 
decidedly  disposed  that it be so oriented as to at  least  partially 
incorporate   the  experience  enjoyed  heretofore  and  that  it   be 
configured  so  as  to  ultimately lead to  the  application  of  more 
rarefied  facets  of  financial  management as  the  major  sphere  of 
responsibility." 

"I was proud to win the Gregg Typting test." 


 SPECIAL REQUESTS & JOB OBJECTIVES:

employer does not know I am looking for another job."

 PHYSICAL DISABILITIES:  

"Minor allergies to house cats and Mongolian sheep." 


 PERSONAL INTERESTS:  

"Donating Blood. 14 gallons so far." 


SM ALL TYPOS THAT CAN CHANGE THE MEANING:
