                      It was only a matter of time? 
 
The  Atari scene at large is intimate with the concept of  fake  demos, 
those works that are a blatant pisstake of the demo makers status  quo. 
We all love their cheesy 'sending-up' of the real thing, don't we?

Well,  we've moved on to the next stage, and it has taken a longer time 
than  you  might have expected,  as it is only now,  after four or five 
years since the first Senior Dads release,  that the first 'fake' games 
are starting to appear!
 
(Fascinating Dadfactfile #1 - We could have had at least one of these a 
year or so before now, as a senior dad put in an appearance at the 1998 
'Cwmvention', and submitted an entry for the 24 hour games competition! 
What happened to that, and the Senior Dads themselves, remains shrouded 
in mystery?)
Š
 Well, screeching firmly back into the present, something went wrong, as 
there are not one, but two entries into the 'too recent to be hallowed' 
halls of fake-game infamy!

Without any sort of ado, we give you....


‰Reverse Pong (by the Paranoid) 

This isn't really a fake game, it just plays like one!

We saw this first shown at the  'Error in Line' party last Easter. This 
is intended to be a part of a much bigger effort, 'Extreme Pong', which 
will  feature  all kinds of strange variations on the  classic  bat  n' 
square pixellated blob theme. 

There is a little bit of presentation at the start,  then straight into 
the main game itself.

'Reverse Pong' takes the simple expedient of disabling the movements of 
the  players bat or paddle,  when the ball/blob is coming towards  him. 
This means you have to roughly anticipate where the ball is coming back 
to  you  and is going to end up,  whilst it is travelling towards  your 
opponent!

The  instant  his/its  (computer player  gender  usually  neuter?)  bat 
manages  to  deflect the ball back your way,  all further  movement  is 
frozen in place, awaiting the inevitable!

Actually,  if  you are really good at anticipating where the ball comes 
back,  then this becomes playable.  Alternatively,  you can 'learn' the 
moves, step-by-step, and get into the game that way.

It  still  kills the late unlamented 'Ping 2000' for  playability,  and 
that was a 'proper' member of the genre!

ST  and  Falcon  compatible  (STOS-based),   with  reasonable  to  nice 
presentation. We await the full 'Extreme Pong' with some anticipation.

 70% - In reverse, that would read 07%!? 


‰Paracontrol, by Nun 

Now here we have something that is an authentic Fake game, and not just 
something  that  mutated from a 'normal' game.  This crept out  shortly 
after the Paracon, but won't win any prizes!

The  game  runs on STe and Falcon,  it is a timely test of  your  mouse 
control and aiming skills,  with a built in boozy 'wobble' anticipating 
the Xmas piss-up season!

As  I'm  really  struggling to find something funny  that  rhymes  with 
'faecal',  I now turn to the third edition of Rogers Profanisaurus, for 
an  entry  that  describes  the  method  and  intention  of  this  game 
to perfection.

 Pace Car  n.   Of paying a sit down visit. the slow unaerodynamic leading 
turd  that  once out of the way,  allows the fast,  souped-up  bastards 
behind it to put their foot down.

Lots of comedy graphics and samples, you'd not be too surprised really.

 65% - Glunz-Blatsch, as our friends in Germany might say?
