                   'Madness' Music compilation demo
                               by Cream

  For the ST, STe, and Falcon '030

This  is a nice little taster for future productions by those musically 
inclined Germans, the demo makers currently known as 'Cream'.

It  is a very simple production,  a music demo featuring tunes from the 
(in)famous  chip  music composer of old style ST  scene  megademos  and 
Thalion games,  'Mad Max' aka Jochen Hippel. There is a difference from 
what  you  might  expect  from  a  Mad  max  music  demo.   The  jangly 
earache/glorious  untarnished  YM symphonies are  entirely  absent.  In 
their  place are new and inproved tunes,   written for the Amiga  in  a 
proprietary  seven  channel(!)  part chipsynth,   part   sample  replay 
format. 

These   are  cover versions of several well-known ST tunes  for   well-
known   games  such  as  'Leavin' Teramis' and  'Chambers  of  Shaolin' 
produced   by  the famous  ex-demo  sceners  software  house   Thalion.  
The   melodies   are tantalisingly familiar to those people  with  ears 
battered  by  the  YM2149 soundchip squawk  from   the  ST.   They  are 
completely  transformed by the  enhanced Amiga replay  system  however, 
and in action, sound quite a lot like a 'luxury' version of a Commodore 
64 SIDchip tune.

It isn't a completely effect-free production either, as there is a very 
cool  take-off of the stylised Thalion logo introduction  which  front-
ended  all  their games.  Like the music,  this has been updated,  so no 
more  bitmaps.  This time  it's done as a bunch of spinning 3D texture-
mapped  objects,   on  an ST!  There is a even a Falcon friendly  reset 
demo.

You  might all be very interested to know this is a precursor to a  new 
music  player   being prepared by Cream,   which will be able  to  play 
nearly  all  proprietary   Amiga  music  formats.   This   is   to   be  
accomplished by a wholesale emulation of the Amiga 'Paula' soundchip!

 Ratings ..

 Effects:-  80% -  Sparse but sharp,  surely their megademo (Heftig) will 
rock hugely?
 
Music:- 85% -  Cool Amiga-ised take on familiar tunes. 

Overall :-  80% -  Great little production to ease those post EIL blues!
