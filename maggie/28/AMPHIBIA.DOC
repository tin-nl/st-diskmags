You have probably have never heard of him,  but Patrick Rondat is a ace 
solo guitarist in France,  his skill probably ranks close to Hendrix or 
Eric Clapton.   He is more famous for being Jean Michel Jarre's backing 
guitarist,  and  if you have seen the 'Concert for Tolerence' video you 
may have seen Rondat's excellent 'Tribute to Vivaldi',  which is one of 
classical composer Vivaldi's Four Seasons works rearranged as a thrashy 
rock anthem.

Rondat  is  a typical long haired 70s metal guitarist,  he is happy  to 
sign  autographs  and chats to fans and enjoys playing gigs.  Loads  of 
Jarre  fans love him as he is such a nice guy.   His inspirations range 
from Jimmy Hendrix to Bob Dylan and from Iron Maiden to Black  Sabbath.  
Amphibia's  name inspiration is simple.   Rondat says as French  people 
are  known  as  frogs he would give this CD  a  French  theme.   Before 
Amphiba, Rondat has done two previous LPs; 'Just for fun', and 'Rape of 
the Earth' as well as an Amphibia live album.

The first track also called Amphibia is one long track made of 4  parts 
like  some of Jarre's Oxygene and Equinoux tracks.   Most of the  other 
tracks are good gently thrashy sort of tracks although the best one  by 
far  is  "Tribute  to  Vivaldi" which is  one  of  the  said  classical 
composer's  famous Four seasons pieces,  rearranged by Rondat as a rock 
anthem, which really stands out. 

I  was a little disappointed that one of the songs I had  heard  Rondat 
play  at  a  Jarre gig,  (unsure of title,  has projection pictures  of 
butterflies in the backround) was not on this CD.

Sadly  this  CD is nigh on impossible to purchase in the UK.   You  can 
purchase it from a few Jean Michel Jarre sites I have seen but at 16.00 
UKP plus postage, this seems a bit high.  I purchased my copy whilst on 
holiday in Cherbourg for 85 Francs (8.50 UKP) which was a good buy.   I 
would  recommend  searching around the web for a  good  small  friendly 
French record shop, that would be willing to ship to the UK.

Forget idiots like Marilyn Manson and Korn,  who are just image setters 
for some of the more gullible Goths, who follow anyone who looks like a 
stunt  double for the Adams family.   If you ever get chatting to Metal 
heads and Goths,  they will tell you they are love to listen to obscure 
bands  that  are  little known,  then why not get yourself  a  copy  of 
Amphibian and surprise them!!
