 
               (This lot has got to be a spoof, right?!)

Now  we  all  think the monstrous  merchandising-inspired  CGI  created 
nightmare  'Jar-Jar  Binks',  from  the confusing  Star  Wars  prequel, 
Phantom Menace, is a bit of a tosser, to put it kindly.

I  chanced upon these prize extracts from the Landover Baptist  Church, 
worshipping all the way over in the good ol' US of A (natch!) It  seems 
they're not too impressed with this character either.
 
 Upon further examination of this very entertaining site,  it looks like 
a  very  cleverly  constructed  piss-take of  the  worst  bits  of  the 
Christian  fundamentalist right.  I'm pretty sure a lot of people think 
it's all real! - CiH, Nov '99 
 
   
          ‰Innocent Kids Use Jar Jar Dolls As Masturbation Toys!
 

When  Mrs.  Tawny  Huxton opened her son Timmy's bedroom door,  she was 
shocked  to see his innocent white hiney nestled into the new  7ft  Jar 
Jar  Binks  doll  she had bought him for  his  birthday.  Lately,  many 
Americans  have  suffered similar incidents.  Young children are  being 
seduced  by the character of George Lucas' latest Star Wars Movie.  Jar 
Jar's soothing voice,  and timid childlike manners,  seem to lure young 
teens  into a world of lustful abandon.  Unsuspecting parents  purchase 
the  popular  life-size doll,  only to find out later that it is  being 
used by the child as a masturbation toy.

Under  the guise of family entertainment,  Lucas's "Star Wars"  prequel 
has  contaminated  America's  youth with  subliminal  sexual  innuendo. 
Pastor  Ebeneezer Smith of the Landover Baptist Church commented,  "The 
demonic  characteristics of the Jar Jar binks creature  become  obvious 
when  one  pays close attention.  His forked tongue,  his lapping,  his 
malignant features, are all too noticeable to the Christ centered man." 
Experts  who  have  examined the life-sized doll that  has  become  the 
favorite  'toy'  of 12-14 year old children,  say that the evidence  is 
overwhelming.   The   doll   was  created  for  the  sole  purpose   of 
masturbation. It  has  four openings,  and three extrusions,  making it 
compatible for male or female pleasure.

Members  of  The Landover Baptist Church are outraged  at  the  Satanic 
subtlety   in  which  marketing  geniuses  have  moved  this   horrific 
abomination  into  the  homes  of  America's  youth.  "One  Mother  was 
concerned that her young daughter was not interested in boys," a Pastor 
noted,  "she asked her little girl,  'why don't you talk about the cute 
boys  at  school?' Her daughter replied,  'oh momma,  nobody I know  is 
cuter  than  Jar Jar Binks." The mother was  horrified.  

Landover Baptist Church finds that the only way to resolve this problem 
is to ban not only life sized Jar Jar Binks dolls from American  homes, 
but to ban any life sized doll.  "Any child that has seen this movie is 
finding that their natural attraction to members of the opposite sex is 
being replaced with an attraction to a 7ft devil with elephant feet,  a 
25 inch tongue, polka dot skin, a fish snout, and two phallic eyes that 
jut  out  like hard erotic pokers.  For the Love of God!  If you've got 
this devil in your house, remove it as soon as possible!

  GEORGE LUCAS CREATES SHOCKING NEW JAR JAR CANDY SEX TOYS  TO  FURTHER 
CORRUPT OUR CHILDREN! FULL STORY!
  

             ‰Lucas Creates Sex Candy Toys for Kids 2 and Up!

 
 America  should  be shocked!  Under the guise of family  entertainment, 
George Lucas has created a device by which youths are instructed in the 
ways  of ungodly sex!  His latest Jar Jar Binks toy contains a 10  inch 
push-up tongue made of strawberry flavored candy.  The tongue is shaped 
like  a  male  sex  organ.  It is hard,  and has a flushed  red  color, 
suggesting  a  youngster wrap his or her mouth around a  fully  aroused 
genital.  Parents  across  the country are purchasing  this  'innocent' 
novelty  for  their  youngsters,  completely unaware  of  it's  demonic 
nature. 

One mother brought the toy home for her 3 year old son. She had no idea 
what  it was,  because the demon's mouth was closed when she  purchased 
it. She turned her head for an instant and when she looked back and saw 
her  boy  sucking on the sex tongue,  she fainted dead on the spot.  It 
took  a  team  of  four paramedics to bring  her  round.  The  boy  was 
punished, and the candy destroyed. 

This toy was created for one purpose, and one purpose alone! That is to 
train a generation of children in the ways of carnality!  One need only 
glance  at the toy to see it's true intent!  As an institution ordained 
by God it is our responsibility to this Christian Nation to expose such 
horrors.  We  cannot  stress how dangerous this toy is.  It is not only 
shocking,  but  hundreds  who have seen it have been sickened unto  the 
point  of  nausea!  We are asking all God fearing Americans to  take  a 
stand against this blatant attack on youthful innocence! Please join us 
in our fight to keep God's country clean from corruption. 

Remember  that Satan is an angel of Light!  He comes quietly into  your 
homes,  creeping,  lured as a suckle to the sweet lips of youth. "Touch 
not the unclean thing!" the Bible tells us.  Well,  we found an unclean 
thing,  and we mean to cut it off,  before our 5 year olds start asking 
questions that most Christian adults would never dream of asking! 

Please  use  the  list below to contact National toy  stores,  and  toy 
distributors.  Tell  them  that  you  will  no  longer  shop  in  their 
sickening,  disgusting,  perverted  stores  until  the  abomination  is 
removed from the shelves! Tell them they have a sex toy for kids ages 2 
and up in their stores,  and decent people will not stand for it! Click 
Here for full size image of sex toy. You will be shocked! 

Contact  These Stores by Clicking.  Once you are there,  send an e-mail 
complaint!  These  are  the main pornographers,  contact your local toy 
stores  as  well!  Don't shop there till we win this Christian  Battle! 
Praise!

                    ‰Age of Masturbation Raised To 65!
 

"Therefore  now let your hands be strengthened." (II Samuel 2:  7a)  In 
this  verse,  King David is talking to Saul (aged 65) giving him advice 
on  how  to go on about his life after the loss of his  beloved  bride. 

This is the key verse in determining the age of allowatory masturbation 
in  male  adults.  According to scripture,  masturbation is a method of 
self-stimulation  directed toward the central pelvic area.  It prevents 
ailments due to lack of blood flow in single or widowed male adults. It 
was  previously  thought that the age of  allowatory  masturbation  was 
placed  at 82 with the verse,  "..one he lamb of the first year without 
blemish." (Numbers 6: 14b) 

Landover Baptist Pastor, Rev. Wilkins pointed out that, "Numbers 6: 14b 
is giving advice to 82 year old widowed men who would 'without blemish' 
bugger  the  he  lamb,  and be promised that God would let the  sin  go 
unnoticed."  He told church members earlier that "It is God's law,  set 
down plain as day in His word," but then added,  "The verse has nothing 
to do with masturbation. The key masturbation verse is II Samuel 2:7a." 
A church council convened and met with the decision that the allowatory 
age   of  masturbation  should  be  lowered  to  reflect  the   correct 
interpretation of scripture. 

Landover  Baptist  Seniors,  widowed or single men age 65 and over  and 
those who were born on or before January 1st 1934 have been alerted  to 
the  new  policy.  These  members may view without a  lustful  thought, 
approved  pornographic materials in the privacy of their  quarters  for 
the sole purpose of masturbation.  An approved incident of masturbation 
must last no longer than 7 minutes and must not occur more than once  a 
day. Locked bathroom doors will be timed and an alarm will sound if the 
door  remains  shut more than 7 minutes.  The resulting fine is set  to 
$2,500. 

For  those  widowed  or  single seniors who have  reached  the  age  of 
allowatory  masturbation and are interested in learning more about  the 
new  policies,  please  visit  the Seniors clinic,  or sign up for  the 
Masturbation Seminars,  given on the first Tuesday of each month. 

You will be taught how to look at a pornographic picture without  lust, 
receive  literature  on Viagra,  a pair of wrist weights,  two jars  of 
vaseline, learn the 7 minute cycle, and much more! 

In  the  same vein,  cooking and sewing classes for single  or  widowed 
Senior ladies will be given.
