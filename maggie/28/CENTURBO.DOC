
                  ‰Centurbo 2 - The definitive lowdown!
                  ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
 
Preamble... 

The  'greed for speed' is a potent infection,  and one which never goes 
away.  I blame the PC people for this,  as every week, it seems they're 
adding  a new processor or other widget to make their machines go  just 
that bit faster for their latest new game,  which would otherwise cluck 
like a sick turkey without it.

We Atari owners sat back smug and satisfied for a long time.  "It's all 
a  matter to getting to know your existing hardware better!" We  cried, 
which is still true to a very large extent.  However,  flattened by the 
constant bombardment of 'fast is good' propaganda from the PC camp, and 
flattered by slick and clever advertising from vendors closer to  home, 
many of us are now thinking the previously unthinkable, speeding up the 
old Falcy.

I  never  really learned from the Nemesis story,  which came down to  a 
case  of 'fine and dandy when the unit was installed and running,  but, 
oh,   the  pain and suffering involved in getting there!' This time was 
going to be different.

I  thought that the going would be infinitely smoother when it came  to 
getting  my brand new Centurbo 2 (revision B) accelerator installed  in 
my ex-Floppyshop Desktopper Falcon. With professional fitting of a very 
high quality, it was going to be easy.

I was, of course, wrong.

Firstly,  'revision  B' turned out to have three chapters in its  short 
and  happy life.  The first 'revision B' turned its nose up at  certain 
kinds of EDO FastRAM, most of them in fact. The second version, which I 
lived with for a good few weeks had a DSP controller that wouldn't talk 
to   the  DSP.  The third attempt got it right with a reprogrammed  DSP 
controller,  but  my DSP had decided to lie down and die,  and could be 
described as 'intermittent' at best.  At the time of writing this first 
installment   of  my  review,  a (hopefully) final visit  to  cure  the 
problem is being arranged.

Do you detect a theme here?

To  be fair,  none of the above can be blamed on the people  installing 
it, the  ever-mighty  System Solutions.  In fact,  I could say that the 
fitting  service provided by Sys Sols,  and their dogged persistence in 
rooting out the various problems,  one by one,  made all the difference 
to  my  sanity  remaining intact over  this  difficult  period.  System 
Solutions  have  been burdened with a reputation for  charging  premium 
prices for their services, but it was really worth it, as they went way 
above and beyond the normal call of duty in laying this thing to rest!

It  is  possible to self-fit the Centurbo 2 (CT2),  but  with  previous 
Nemesis  related  experiences  on my mind,  you would have to  be  very 
*very*  sure  of yourself to make the attempt.  A professional  fitting 
service of the quality of System Solutions is an essential item, if you 
are planning to spend that sort of money anyway.

Anyway,  at  time  of  writing  this  opening  bit,  I  have  a  nicely 
functioning  50  mhz GEM-box with "occasional" DSP support!  (Sys  Sols 
thinks the DSP SRAM keeps failing.) We should have the full system, DSP 
and all  by the time I get down to doing some heavy duty games and demo 
testing.
 
(Update  note,  we  got it back okay!  See the software section for the 
lowdown!)
 

 An overview... 

Centurbo 2 is one of the next generation of Falcon accelerators. It had 
been  in the pipeline for some time before,  but hadn't been seen until 
the  back  end  of last year,  presumably to allow  for  an  extra-long 
testing  and debugging 'making really sure' period.

It  escews the earlier Nemesis and Centurbo 1 methods of  acceleration, 
which  is  to  overclock,speeding up key  existing  components  of  the 
Falcon.  This  method  is  fine up to a point,  but is limited  by  the 
tolerances  and goodwill of those components.  In the case of  Nemesis, 
the  speed gain was kept to an extra 50% over normal,  as this may have 
been perceived as a maximum 'safe' working level for the CPU and  other 
support hardware.

In  other  words,  something  like Nemesis could be made to  go  a  lot 
faster,  but the failure rate could go up a lot too!  Don't forget,  we 
are  talking of Falcons made from job-lot components,  sourced by Atari 
from God knows where, at the cheapest possible prices!

Centurbo 2 takes the pressure off by running a separate higher  quality 
68030  CPU at 50 mhz on a daughterboard.  This is actually a 32 mhz CPU 
overclocked  itself  to 50 mhz.  Official 50 mhz (clocked to  75  mhz!) 
processors were used in early prototypes,  but various complications in 
obtaining these, and in keeping manufacturing costs down, meant that
these couldn't really be considered.

Fact:- My Centurbo fitted Falcon has had its original 16 mhz 68030  CPU 
removed!  With  the new CPU running at all times,  the old processor is 
just sitting there consuming power and doing nothing otherwise.

CT2  runs  on  a daughterboard,  with the CPU  and  68882  co-processor 
(optional  but  very  useful) on there,  and many wires  going  off  to 
different parts of the Falcy.  The DSP is charged to 50 mhz, not such a 
great  gain  as the CPU,  but still very useful,  the bus is speeded up 
accordingly,  with implications for new and exciting video modes,  more 
of which shortly.
 
The other major advantage to CT2,  is its thoroughly modern approach to 
adding extra memory.  This is in the form of EDO fastRAM (the PC owners 
first  choice!) The revision B can take things all the way to 128MB!  I 
settled  for a good price on 64MB,  which is more than enough for  most 
Falcon  owners,  who are still really waiting for something that  fully 
demands the 14MB of a standard machine! I got a strange warm and tingly 
feeling  from  owning  a Falcon with more memory as  my  original  1993 
purchased Falcon had hard disk space! (64MB plus 14MB)

There is a certain amount of software to go with the hardware,  various 
system patches and autofolder programs, benchmark and testing utilites, 
CentScreen  and CentVidel,  and demo versions of other Centek  programs 
too.

When you finally get to switching it on,  a choice of three modes is on 
offer,  normal  16  mhz Falcon,  Turbo without fastRAM,  and the rather 
strangely named TOS 7.02 mode, with full fastRAM support. Being keen to 
get on with it,  I opted for 7.02.  (An option for Dolmen,  the new O/S 
for the Phenix was on the flash ROM menu, but has been quietly dropped, 
as it was only for use by Phenix developers anyway.)


 How it feels in use... 

With the CPU going from a lowly 16 mhz,  to a rather less lowly 50 mhz, 
the view from the desktop is transformed from "Take a good long look at 
that",  to  "Did you see that?!" A large part of the improvement,  GEM-
wise does come from NVDI, essential if using CT2 in its highest 'turbo' 
mode  with fastRAM support.  That isn't to downplay all the good things 
that  are  going  on at the CPU level,  as many  things  which  chugged 
sedately before, now charge along with renewed urgency.

For  example,  Aniplayer (used by Centek to demonstrate CT2) manages to 
comfortably  run the vast majority of .AVI and .MOV animations  without 
any missed screens.  Even .JPG depacking without DSP is in the category 
of  'lightning fast',  thanks to the speeded up CPU.  Many GEM programs 
are transformed by the sheer speed.

With CT2, there seems to be a pretty solid feel whilst in use. Even the 
notoriously fickle MagiC O/S can be tamed sufficiently to work with it, 
and with the gorgeous Jinnee desktop running in conjunction with it, in 
high resolution Truecolour mode, CT2 really comes into its own.

We're  still  trying  to resolve the question  of  internet  connection 
software,   as  CT2 and parts of STinG don't seem to get along with the 
current CAB overlay module? When this is sorted, then internet browsing 
will become a positive pleasure,  rather than an extended wait,  if the 
impressive off-line speed of CAB is any guideline.

In general, CT2 in operation feels like an enlivening cool shower after 
a hot and sticky summer day.  


 How Fast?

 Okay, so you want some benchmarks then?

I've  stayed away from GEMbench,  as it tends to throw too much on  the 
screen/VDI  update  side of things,  especially if you're comparing  an 
NVDI  fitted  computer with a machine that doesn't  have  it.  Instead, 
Nembench concentrates purely on the CPU, and we compare the Afterburner 
040, The CT2, and this Falcon temporarily removed from its normal guise 
of high speed glamour and running at an uncharismatic 16 mhz speed. 

For the purposes of making sense of the results,  assume a stock Falcon 
runs  (mostly) at values of 100%.  There is an exception on my machine, 
which I'll explain at the appropriate time.

Firstly, the Afterburner 040..
 
NemBench v2.1 - precision CPU/FPU profiler.

Float multiply (64bit)       -> 6.606 MegaFlops (~2492%)  Wow!
Float divide (64bit)         -> 0.875 MegaFlops (~505%)   These
Linear (stalled) float       -> 6.770 MegaFlops (~1270%)   are fast!

32bit read (100% hit)        -> 125.786 MByte/sec (~801%)
32bit write (100% hit)       -> 17.730 MByte/sec (~265%)

Linear 32bit read (ST-Ram)   -> 5.092 MByte/sec (~95%)
Linear 32bit write (ST-Ram)  -> 4.879 MByte/sec (~75%)
Linear 32bit copy (ST-Ram)   -> 2.493 MByte/sec (~77%)

Linear 32bit read (FastRAM)  -> 34.629 MByte/sec (~651%)
Linear 32bit write (FastRAM) -> 17.055 MByte/sec (~264%)
Linear 32bit copy (FastRAM)  -> 11.397 MByte/sec (~353%)

Linear burst copy (ST-Ram)   -> 2.617 MByte/sec (~81%)
Linear burst copy (FastRAM)  -> 19.650 MByte/sec (~608%)
Linear burst copy (ST->Fast) -> 4.582 MByte/sec (~141%)
Linear burst copy (Fast->ST) -> 4.649 MByte/sec (~144%)

As  you  can  see,  the '040 scores impressively over a  stock  Falcon, 
especially  where its 040 based floating point power leaves  everything 
else  for  dead.  It seems to be happiest with FastRAM,  as ST RAM read 
write  and  copy is slower than even on an '030 16  mhz  machine.  Read 
performances   in  FastRAM  score  significantly  higher   over   write 
performances.  The  generally  accepted 'rough' benchmark is 8x  faster 
than a stock Falcon, but some bits are a great deal faster than others.

Linear 32bit write (FastRAM) -> 38.778 MByte/sec (~601%)
Linear 32bit copy (FastRAM)  -> 13.855 MByte/sec (~429%)

Much has been made of the impressive FastRAM performance compared  with 
just about everything else, and this has even been used to score points 
off  Afterburner!  Read/write  rates  are a lot  less  dissimilar  than 
Afterburner,  everything  else more or less reflects the fact that this 
is  roughly  a  3x CPU speedup over a stock  Falcy  in  the  relatively 
neutral  setting  of  a NemBench test.

Linear 32bit write (ST-Ram)  -> 6.488 MByte/sec (~100%)
Linear 32bit copy (ST-Ram)   -> 3.247 MByte/sec (~100%)

Almost  everything  comes up with the magic 100%.  Note,  there are  no 
FastRAM  figures.  Also  note,  that my Falcy has an FPU which may well 
distort the figures in the float section?


 Screen Modes... 

With the supplied CentScreen software (reviewed in Maggie 27), Some new 
and  interesting possibilities come to light.  Quite apart from all the 
standard  (and very well known) Falcon screen modes,  two in particular 
stand out.

Firstly,  we  are  able  to  force  out a high  resolution  640  x  480 
truecolour  screen mode (this is a fudge of 320 x 480,  but it  works!) 
There isn't the sort of speed drop that you get normally when trying to 
squeeze  truecolour out of a standard Falcon either,  as GEM  responses 
are  still pretty sharp.  Obvious benefits include truecolour operation 
of   picture   displayers,   art,   image   processing  and   animation 
packages.Displaying  of pictures is quicker as the time-lag to  convert 
down to, say, 256 colours in an equivalent screen res has gone as well.

Also,  it  is  nice  to  be able to be able to  www  browse  with  full 
truecolour  and  a decent lick of speed.  Not forgetting that GEM  Demo 
looks really good in hi-res, especially in a multi-tasking context! One 
of  my  favourite  things  that  I  did  the  other  day,  was  to  run 
MagiC/Jinnee in 640 x 480 truecolour,  with GEM Demo and Aniplayer (and 
a  couple  of other things) going at the same time.  Now that's what  I 
call multi-tasking!  Even with a 25 megabyte animation running entirely 
in memory, I still had the  best part of 40-50 meg of RAM left!

With MagiC,  to get that elusive high-res truecolour mode,  you have to 
set up Centscreen in normal TOS first, and save the mode, then save the 
desktop.  When you go into MagiC,  select truecolour 320 x 480, and off 
you go!

The  other screen mode that turned into a bit of a show-stopper  on  my 
monitor,  was  the  1024  x 768 in 256 colours mode.  This  was  almost 
certainly  interlaced somewhere,  as there was some slight flicker.  It 
was  interesting  to  try  out  picture  viewers  with  that   extended 
resolution, and almost certainly, web-browsing would give good results, 
as an offline test of CAB seemed to show.  With this screen mode, there 
is a bit more of a tendency for crashes to occur. These are still rare, 
and  may be down to tolerances of certain GEM software being  pushed  a 
bit too hard?

You  may  want to try out 1024 x 768 in mono,  especially if  you're  a 
large  desktop area DTP freak with a good monitor.  This upgrade  makes 
the Falcon serious competition for the TT even in that specialised area 
at last.

In  the end,  I found that my preferred day to day option,  was a user-
defined screen mode of 800 x 592, of either 256 or 16 colours. Centvidl 
came  in useful there.  Screen updates and overall system speed  remain 
good.
 
                  That all-important software round-up!
 
 Games...

 (3D polygon games) 
I  tried  'Running' The definitive Duke/Doom clone first.  Yes it  ran, 
Centurbo's own list was telling the truth after all. It is very fast in 
low detail mode,  the main menu music does not play correctly,  but the 
in-game sound FX are all still ok.

On  the  low  detail setting,  this game feels like a fast  PC  playing 
'Doom',  in other words,  incredibly fast! Speed is still acceptable on 
high detail. As far as I was concerned, this game alone is a sufficient 
showcase for the power of the CT2, the rest of what was to follow was a 
pleasant bonus.

Next,  I  looked  at  the underrated and  underpowered  gallic  classic 
'Lasers and Men'. Anxiously awaited the main game screen, and yes, this 
one  worked  too.  There was an immediately notable improvement in  the 
framerate. It still wasn't completely smooth, but good enough now. With 
a tendency for the game to throw in the odd super-tough bad guy,  it is 
still  a SOB to play!  Sound support,  including title screen music was 
there, and unblemished.

There  was  also  a Lasers and Men,  pre-preview version.  Again,  this 
worked fine.  It also does not use the DSP,  I found that out as it was 
one of the few that worked in my 'DSP-less' period. The pre-preview was 
more  sensible  in  some respects than the final game.  It  only  half-
textured  its world, only the walls were textured, so it was acceptably 
fast  even  on a standard Falcy,  making it very fast on turbo.  It was 
also memorable for using a bunch of ripped Wolfenstein graphics.

We  soon  went  for some space-based action in the form  of  'Crown  of 
Creation  3D'.  This  worked,  but  there were problems in the form  of 
frequent  DSP clashes and communication error messages when the  action 
heated  up  with the appearance of DSP generated  spaceship  shaped  3D 
objects. This is really better at the standard 16mhz Falcon, unless you 
like lots of error messages onscreen, right in the middle of the mother 
of all DSP object generated space battles.

I  would  give  this game top marks for  error  handling  though,  this 
program shows a very high standard of finish not out of place for  many 
professional  productions,  as most other games would have crashed  for 
good at that point!

Towers  II ran without a glitch.  This game never was really slow on  a 
stock Falcon though. Nice to see it could work on here.

The  ex Compo France 'F-Zero' styled racer 'Moon Games' ran,  once  you 
remember  to boot it in accelerator friendly 'Mode B'.  Very smooth and 
responsive  indeed.  Also a testament to the programmers recognition of 
accelerators relatively early in the Falcon's life.

I'm still not sure about 'Steel Talons'.  You may well remember this as 
one  of  the  Atari sponsored productions,  where Atari  Corp  took  an 
average arcade game, and then beat the third party developers senseless 
with the 'mediocre stick', to produce an uninspired conversion. It is a 
genuine  3D game.  Its graphics seem closer to the ST than the  Falcon, 
reasonable  for  the earlier machine,  but not a patch on later  native 
Falcon games. It seems like it wants to run, but freezes?

More investigations are needed.

Another game we took a closer look at was the Czech created  hovercraft 
simulator  'Gravon'.  This  was  interesting for its  simulation  of  a 
'Midwinter' style landscape, with added effects such as mistiness. Like 
many of the other games discussed, it could have really used a touch of 
extra polygon processing power.  It got it with CT2 in full turbo.  The 
one noteworthy 'extra' that we got was a flickery control panel.

Gravon was a bit fussier than normal,  as to run it, we had to dispense 
with  the Centscreen resolution changer,  it only works with the boring 
default  TOS res changer.  The sound on this game is present (no  title 
music though) and it has a nasty habit of kicking the internal  speaker 
on,  whether  you  want it or not!  Gravon always was a bit of a sod to 
play,  but that is not now through any lack of 3D updating. Like Lasers 
and Men, perhaps more a case of a difficulty level tilted away from the 
player?

Reekin' Rubber (v0.8) ran beautifully,  averaging a frame rate of 27-28 
frames  per  second!  The finished game is looked forward to with  some 
anticipation by us!

Looking  at  an  ST-based,  but  'generic' 3D game,  the  follow-up  to 
'Elite'.  David Braben's 'Frontier'. This did run, and very smoothly as 
well.  One of the few games on Atari to sit totally within legal system 
guidelines,  this could be seen to run on 8 mhz ST (very slow),  16 mhz 
Falcon,  (acceptable),  and even 32 mhz TT (very acceptable!). Caused a 
bit of excitement running at 50 mhz, I can tell you!

'Hunter'  was  another  favourite on the ST.  I came across  a  cracked 
version,  which  was able to run from the desktop,  and this coped with 
CT2 turbo mode! There wasn't a lot of difference discernible, it always 
had a good 3D virtual world engine that was comfortable, even on an ST.

It may well be worth trying out some other 3D ST-based games, if these 
are runnable from the desktop somehow. This will probably exclude most 
legal/original disk protected copies?

One  that springs to mind to try,  would be Unique Developments gouraud 
based Wolfenstein genre classic 'Sub Station'. This runs fast enough on 
a 16 mhz Falcon in any case, and might be too much of a good thing with 
a CT2 turbo mode?

One  game which might occur to a lot of people to try with CT2 too,  is 
the  Caspian Software STe derived space arcade blaster 'Zero  5'.  This 
WON'T  work  under  CT2 turbo mode,  as it uses the blitter,  which  is 
locked  out by NVDI on turbo mode.  The blitter isn't that acceleration 
friendly,  even  with  less  ambitious  speedups such  as  Nemesis,  so 
anything trying to use it would crash.

Another  ST  classic is the racing game 'Vroom',which got as far  as  a 
Falcon '030 version.  The version I got may or may not be official, but 
bears a strong resemblance to the ST original?

The  title  sequence works fine,  but the main game screen is  severely 
messed up.  Until you look again,  and try it without Centscreen,  then 
it's  fine!  The  only thing left to do then,  is to try to contact the 
programmers  to  ask  them to  widen the tracks.  We now have  F1  cars 
charging around at close to Mach 1 (supersonic!) speeds.  The trackside 
objects do,  rather tediously,  make their presence felt a lot as well. 
You  even get full in-game sound effects,  so every roadside scrunch is 
heard.


(Non Polygon games)

The  majority  of non-polygon based games won't really need  the  extra 
speed afforded by the CT2. In some cases, it could well hinder them!

Another  area  where a big speed-up paid off was with  the  Godboy  and 
Godlenes  emulators.  There was a big improvement (the music messed up, 
so  turn it off) but the the emulation speed was more authentic,  and a 
lot more playable in the case of early Godboy releases, especially
'Megaman'!

A quick note regarding other Reservoir Gods games.  These aren't really 
speed critical,  and in the case of 'Double Bobble',  the blitter kicks 
in with those zooming points scores,  and will therefore crash it. (You 
might  like  to try 'Skyfall' in 'suicide mode' sometime,  just  for  a 
moments sick self-amusement!)

Willies Adventures, the preview version, apparently, yes, even the 
music,  according  to  one report I've had.  The finished game,  when it 
turns up, will be well worth seeing!

The  Bad Mood and Patrice Mandin Doom engines should work.  I  probably 
need a new WAD file as mine may have got corrupted? Doom gets so far on 
the  main  menu,  and  crashes.  There is an early (unoptimised?)  demo 
'Quake' engine reported as 'crawling' on CT2. Source - Evil of DHS

Do Say:- "Heey, I'm getting motion sickness from speeding up Running!"

Don't say:- "Will 'Backwards' still run in turbo mode?'


 Music... 

With music products,  the news was very mixed. This being an area where 
the DSP was most likely to be heavily used.

First  off  the  musical blocks was Graoumf Tracker.  It  worked,  just 
about. It was fiddly about which screen mode it liked to run in, really 
preferring  a  16 colour mode.  In 256 colour mode,  it leaves a  mouse 
pointer  trail onscreen which is messy.  The modfile format selector in 
the  program  tends to provoke a crash too.  There is some gain on  CPU 
time,  but not as great as might have been anticipated.  One S3M, which 
is my 100% CPU benchmark on a standard Falcon,  came up 60ish% CPU time 
used?  This  may well show the extent to which the DSP is being  leaned 
upon here?  This is listed as compatible in Centek's own listing, but I 
seem  to  be one of the luckier ones here,  as some CT2  fitted  Falcys 
refuse to play with this one?

Digital  Tracker  was  a firm 'No' It never  will  either,  if  various 
stories about the poor relations between the author and Centek/Class  4 
are  true?  This,  sadly,  extends  to trying to use it in normal 16 mhz 
mode.

The news was better for Flex Tracker v0.5,  which works fine and ran in 
a stable fashion.  Hopes are high for the full version (currently up to 
v0.8 at time of writing.)

Mega Player (registered version) Yes, up to a point, but crashes on the 
bigger multi-channel modfiles, which it really shouldn't? This has been 
reported as a 'no go' by at least one other CT2 owner (Evil of DHS.)

The  rather  strange  huge virtual screen  area  based  'Mega  Tracker' 
(preview version) does, but only on RGB systems?

With the Commodore 64 music emulator 'Flaysid' player, this works fine, 
which  is what the authors would have intended anyway.  Nice to see  no 
more slowdown of replay on the higher quality 33 mhz mode.

The Creamsid player works fine too. As it does not use GEM or expect to 
run  in a multi-tasking environment,  there isn't really a need for  it 
to.  It  will  be interesting to see how the forthcoming generic  Amiga 
format player will respond to turbo mode?

Protracker  is  doubtful on turbo mode.  The program boots up,  'Faclon 
Commando'  message  and all,  modfiles load in,  and you can access the 
different  modes  for 'edit',  'play' etc,  but when trying to play the 
modfile,  nothing  moves!  (You  can quit out safely,  so it isn't as if 
there is a crash.)

There  are still other players and tracker programs to try out,  expect 
to get mixed results from what you try.


 Graphics.. 

The  area of graphics software produced some excitement  and  interest, 
especially as certain programs had a lot more screen area to play  with 
than before!

We spent a long time with Apex Media.  There was extensive testing done 
using this,  especially with the earlier DSP fault. One way how to find 
out  if  your  DSP  is playing or not from Apex  is  to  click  on  the 
Cyberdials  option.  If  it  gets  stuck,  you've got a  problem.  Also 
problems  with  JPEG loading will show themselves with a  screenful  of 
white garbage displayed. If there is no DSP fault, then Apex works just 
fine.  The  extra  fluidity  is  noticeable when using  even  the  more 
involved tools.

Later versions of this program are capable of hi-res truecolour  screen 
modes and work areas.

The  Apex  viewers all came up fine.  They were quick,  but they always 
were.

With  'Godpaint',  it only seemed to like 100hz VGA,  came up a mess on 
RGB.

Rainbow Paint was a definite no-show. Standard mode only.

GEMview got a new lease of life with turbo mode. Loading and displaying 
were very good,  fast loading,  even without Brainstorm DSP depacker on 
JPEG  was  impressive.   There  were  very  good  results  in  extended 
resolutions - 1068 x 768 - 256 colour. With the depacker, loading times 
on most JPEG files dropped right down.

Image Copy 4 benefited from the Brainstorm JPEG depacker too. Also able 
to use the extended screen modes.

Speed of Light 3.8,  yep,  again, happy to accomodate a huge 256 colour 
screen.

It has been reported that the *original* Atari Neopaint works in turbo! 
(not Neo Master?) Also Crackart may well work too,  this was written to 
work on both an ST and TT, so it should do.

Aniplayer works. but you would expect it to, with the author developing 
on  a  CT2  based Falcon!  Impressive results were obtained  with  JPEG 
loading and AVI/MOV file playing. DSP decompression with the 50 mhz DSP 
played  its  part  in  reducing CPU load  on  a  multi-tasking  system, 
Excitingly,  future  versions of Aniplayer are to support a better MPEG 
player,  including  MPEG  audio  level  3!  (MP3) A beta of  this  with 
unoptimised MP3 playing code 'lifted' from the PC is doing the rounds.

Smurf  (demo version) was tried out,  and found to work in the extended 
GEM screen modes. Those effects modules supplied with it showed a major 
reduction in the time factor (whilst still not quite being real-time on 
some of the more complex ones.) Again,  able to use the Brainstorm JPEG 
depacker, where this was present.

Best  of all.  the 'Whip' Sound to Light software definitely does  work 
under CT2 turbo!  (like Godpaint,  only really fancying 100hz VGA,  but 
not RGB whilst in turbo?)


 Demos... 

The  most subjective area of all....  Many won't.  These are ones which 
do.

Where  monitors  are concerned.  things get extremely  subjective  from 
here, and some productions which are described as working under my SVGA 
may well not work, if it is an older and less flexible screen. The best 
bet  to  get maximum compatibility is to try to lay hands on  a  decent 
modern multisync or SVGA screen. As a rough rule, if it can get a 100hz 
mode, then you'll be fine. 

The Alive Demo by FUN will.  This one is nice,  with lots of 3D enviro-
mapped objects. Also the ATS Demo by DHS does. Both of these are recent 
EIL (Error in Line) releases. Both authors are using a CT2. 'Alive' has 
more  to offer with an options menu for enhancements with extra  speed, 
higher definition 3D objects etc. ATS is just happy to run.

Another  EIL  release,  the  'Revert' demo by Cobra runs  too.  It  was 
notable for running a very slow 3D virtual world on a standard machine, 
so any extra performance is clearly a bonus. it still isn't the fastest 
in the world,  but it is better than before. Even the sound track works 
(A long sample made from an .XM modfile.  ) It is really an RGB demo in 
normal life, but was able to run on my SVGA.

If  you really want to show off the sheer CPU power of a CT2,  then I'd 
recommend  the  DHS Orneta '97 4ktro (4ever?) It  is  blindingly  fast! 
There is no DSP involvement,  but don't forget,  the FPU is used.  Just 
watch those tunnels fly!

The 'Blue' 4ktro by New Beat from Orneta '97 runs as well. It runs like 
the clappers but really needs an RGB screen. The later 'Flu' 4ktro gets 
as far as the title screen then hangs when it tries to get to the  next 
part.

The  Symposium 4ktros were worth checking out.  The Lazer 'Gurkensalat' 
Elite-tro, is *very* fast in turbo! The Spirits Ewigekeit God-tro runs, 
and also the tSCc 3D morphing grid, and the TNB BSE+ intros.

BSE+, timed to 2 minutes normally with countdown on screen, runs out of 
effects  about 23 seconds from the end in turbo!  All best started from 
ST low. All ran okay on my SVGA at 100hz.

Other  intros that did,  included the EIL DHS Party invite  (bumpmapped 
lake effect with haunting Tommy soundtrack.) This runs extremely  fast, 
musically perfect too.  Also,  the Place to Be part V intro runs, there 
are lots of complex 3-D objects, toasters, gouraud cows, etc, which are 
very  slow on a standard Falcon,  now running at a respectable speed on 
CT2  turbo (looks like all CPU and no DSP apart from audio.)  Parts  of 
this intro may have been derived from an Amiga demo?  Both of these ran 
perfectly on my SVGA.

The  'Joint  Venture'  demo does,  amazingly enough,  just  ignore  the 
garbage onscreen at the very beginning.  It prefers RGB screens and the 
music  timing  is  'out',  but that doesn't matter with  this  demo  as 
effects  and  music  not really linked.  individual parts such  as  the 
'solar system' bit at the beginning are conspiciously faster.

Tat's 'Sono' demo was not expected to work but we tried anyway!  Before 
it  did  crash,  those  fishes didn't half shift  onscreen.  Completely 
fluid,  natural,  fantastic!  It could have been interesting to see Tat 
carving  out  some  code for the CT2.  If the basics for his  3D  world 
worked  okay on a standard Falcon,  it would only have been a matter of 
adjusting  the  CPU/DSP ratios and sitting back and enjoying  the  vast 
extra power!?

Lost  Blubb  ran under turbo!  I'll repeat that,  Lost Blubb ran  under 
turbo! Yes it did, although the music timing drifted badly out with the 
rest  of the demo, and cut off abruptly at the end. Many of the effects 
were  very much faster!  We never realised that Martina had it in  her! 
This  is  one where you would need a really good screen,  as it ran  on 
both my SVGA and RGB monitors,  but not perfectly in either case.  (but 
with all the best bits still on show!)

The early but nicely formed Tat-derived effort 'Bio' did,  but not very 
well on RGB. It was fine on my SVGA though. The speed-up can be seen to 
best  effect  with  the fastest smoothest Z-Buffering  on  offer,  even 
including the previously sluggish textured objects!

The  Hydroxid  Symposium  '96  entry was  very  well  behaved,  running 
perfectly  on  my SVGA,  incredible,  bearing in mind one of the  major 
effects were to do with DSP dot objects.

The early Lazer megademo, 'Autowaschen Verboten' (Ungto) did, but with
corrupted speeded up sound, in fact speeded up everything. Scarey! And  
it got a picture from my SVGA, but garbled the screen on RGB!

In general,  I don't subscribe to conventional wisdom,  which would say 
that  demos ought not to run outright on such an accelerator as a  CT2. 
Whilst  this  is  mostly  true,  you  can see from  the,  by  no  means 
exhaustive,  list above,  that quite a lot do to some extent, including 
one  or  two  surprises!  

In general, if you are exploring your demo collection, then be prepared 
to  expect  the following.  Strange screen modes,  and demos working on 
monitor types they normally ought not to work on.  Conversely, on other 
screens  where they do normally run,  then they may not?  In some cases 
you might get dodgy sound, although the majority of the time, the sound 
player was the bit that worked the best.  The soundtrack can get out of 
sync with the effects a lot of the time.  Some demos, certain EKO demos 
springing  to mind here,  run a large part of the way in,  but crash in 
mid-demo (when deploying a DSP based effect, probably?)

There have been some notable failures found as we've gone into this.

The DHS 'Dream Dimension' demo didn't,  a shame for a relatively recent 
and  rather good demo.  It wasn't even very good with the DSP IRQ patch 
running in standard mode where jerks about and blinks onscreen as if it 
was running out of frames? Good job I've still for my Nemesis Falcy.
 Update,  problem  solved  when a CT2 friendly version of that demo  was 
released! Thanks Evil!
 
'Termfin',  the  grand-daddy of all Falcon demos by Amiga legend Sanity 
didn't really get going.  The soundtrack implied it was there,  but the 
screen stayed blank.

The  1995 Inter   'Obnoxious' megademo crashed and made a "Turn off  this 
machine NOW!" type noise.

On  an  almost  incidental note to close this  section,  you  might  be 
interested to know that both Maggie shells,  ST,  and Falcon (issue 27) 
ran  okay  under turbo mode,  even the music was fine,  with the Falcon 
shell  using  Graoumf sources.  The only really noticeable  differences 
were the really fast picture loading/depacking,  and the elimination of 
speed lags on the text displayer in VGA when playing the really intense 
bits of a multi-channel modfile.

The  equally legendary Undercover MagaScene,  at least in its issue  15 
and  16  incarnations,  was also happy with Centurbo 2 set any way  you 
like.


 Still rumbling on, issues yet to be resolved? 

I finally got my DSP back in a fully working state,  thanks to the hard 
work  of the nice people at System Solutions.  Rather than an  outright 
component failure (the DSP Static RAM was suspected),  it seemed that a 
bad connection/dry solder joint was to blame,  and a resolder cured the 
fault. (Revise paragraph when eventually get machine working!!)

This  is why you've now got compatibility reports on all  those  lovely 
games and demos detailed above!

At  time  of writing,  I still have internet connection  software  that 
crashes/freezes  the moment I dial into my account when in turbo  mode. 
It  is  an oldish version of STinG,  and it looks like this  will  need 
replacing,  which  I  am  loath  to do,  taking Mr Pink's view  on  the 
subject, "If it isn't broken, then don't fix it!"

It now seems that it is broken?

Also,  once  you've  got  past  the  barrier  of  actually  making  the 
connection work,  there is the possibility, that CAB may well provoke a 
crash  on  its  own.  This may be down to a clash  between  STinG,  and 
certain  versions  of  the CAB ovl module?  A shame,  as CAB runs  very 
sweetly with the extra speed on offer on an offline basis.

There  may  well be a follow-up,  which may or may not come within  the 
scope  of this article.  I'd be very disappointed if this aspect of the 
upgrade turned out to be a letdown?

I'm a *little* disappointed that the greatest failure rate seems to  be 
in  the crucial audio sector.  The DSP-IRQ patch partially resolves the 
situation, but it isn't perfect. At least one person has come up with a 
schematic  to  rewire  the DSP IRQ back into  things,  (the  author  of 
Aniplayer.) Digital Tracker is the biggest permanent failure,  detailed 
earlier, not working even in standard 16 mhz mode.

There  was  the  odd bout of NVDI inspired 'whiteing  out'  of  desktop 
icons, but this seems to have settled down. The very early installation 
of  CT2  with the bugged DSP controller had a habit of  chewing  up  my 
newdesk.inf  file,  but with the second fitting,  that problem vanished 
too.

Apart  from  that,  Centurbo  2 hasn't presented me with  any  horrible 
surprises  since,  and  being left on over a good period of  time,  has 
stayed  rock  solid.  A reassuring change from my other  Falcon,  which 
suffers  from  'mouse  cursor epilepsy' from time to  time.  Any  other 
failures  are due to the extreme nature of the power on offer,  and the 
software not being able to cope with it.


 Some ideas you might like to try? 

With  an  upgrade of this extent,  it really could be worth  trying  to 
'think  outside of the box' (management seminar cliche no.962!)  I  was 
personally heartened that so much of the very best Falcon software  ran 
on the CT2.

I daresay the gendarmerie were called in,  to investigate the source of 
the  manic sounds of cheering around the vicinity of Centek  GHQ,  when 
they found out 'Running' worked!

There  is  a  certain amount of software,  both  Falcon  specific,  and 
intended for the higher spec TOS clones, that would really go down well 
on  a  CT2  powered Falcy.  There are even  individual  'scene'  people 
involved   pretty   directly  with  their  own  CT2's,   and   offering 
enhancements to their new productions at the very least?

It  is unlikely that there will be anything really written closely  for 
the CT2,  owing to the sort of development time needed. We've been very 
lucky to get the software that we have now,  with the sort of pressures 
working against us over the last few years.

I  might  suggest  investigating a few possibilities  to  (quickly  and 
easily?) fill the gap though.

I  wonder if there is an Amiga equivalent to 'Bad Mood',  say one  that 
got  more  developed,   used  original  material,  had  sources  freely 
available, and was still able to run decently on a 50 mhz '030?

Just speculating there?

Porting  of  Amiga demo effects,  and wholesale demos?  The majority of 
'Scene' Amigas are probably accelerated to some extent by now. It might 
be difficult to convert Power PC based Amiga stuff over,  but there was 
a lot of faster '030 material?  Think about it, the Falcon has one over 
the Amiga, if you are able to use the 50 mhz DSP as well?

Generally,  for  demo coders.  might be interesting to see if you could 
get  something of the 3D world complexity of 'Sono' without  having  to 
use  the DSP?  Tat's 'Binliner' sources could be a good starting  point 
here?

Another area which could be re-examined,  is the conversion of emulator 
software,  again, this would be mainly Amiga based, with the sources in 
common?  CT2  seems  to be able to handle 8-Bit computer  emulation  of 
those existing TOS-based emulators with ease. It should be able to do a 
half-decent Commodore 64, and hopefully some of the more interesting 8-
bitters,  say  the  Amstrad  6128  or MSX?  DSP support  would  not  be 
necessary, and apart from soundchip emulation of the Flaysid variety, I 
can't see how the DSP could be made use of for an emulator?

To give you an idea of what is possible now, the AtOric v0.9 Oric Atmos 
emulator timed to 5-6 seconds on a benchmark program running under  CT2 
turbo  mode.  This is comparable with 15 seconds on the real thing,  25 
seconds on a TT,  and 127 seconds on a standard ST.  This also compares 
reasonably well with the 5 seconds taken by an '040 Milan!

Matthias  Jaap  suggested that someone might try to  convert  the  MESS 
Multi  machine emulator,  which can emulate several different computers 
and consoles.  This may be marginal,  even on a CT2,  if not optimised, 
but  would give access to a vast software library of many thousands  of  
titles!

Whilst I'm on the subject,  anyone up for an Atari version of M.A.M.E.? 
(The  arcade emulator.) I'd be happy with the early vector-based  Atari 
games,  Asteroids,  Gravitar,  that  kind  of thing.  (See John Haywards 
review in this issue.)

Okay, that'll be it for now. Like I said, just a few ideas.


 And finally... 

It  has been a long six months since I started to get this upgrade.  In 
an  echo of the hyper-extended Mr Pink Nemesis 'awayday' saga,  I  have 
only just now got a fully working CT2!

To  be fair,  I've not been without my Falcy for a very long time,  and 
I've had it working in some form or other since the second visit to the 
premises  of  System Solutions.  (I've got to know the inside of  their 
workshop  *very*  well,  and  I  can tell you that  among  other  Atari 
curiosities,  they've  got  a  couple of old style  ST's  (no  built-in 
floppy, slightly smaller case!) also, what looks like a brand new SH204 
20MB  hard  drive,  complete with manual,  and that was something which 
stopped being new in 1987!)

I've had time to examine the different aspects of CT2, and they haven't 
been  found wanting.  In the case of the more difficult 'non GEM legal' 
software  arena,  I've  been pleasantly surprised at what did  actually 
run!

CT2 certainly will add a new lease of life to a tired and slow  feeling 
Falcon,  especially  where  software seems to make more demands of  it, 
such as the new generation of GEM software really intended for the  new 
TOS  clones.  It  is refreshing to use in turbo mode,  and very hard to 
switch back to 'normal'.  I've already raved on enough about its effect 
on certain games and demos, so I won't anymore!

In  the context of the limited current market,  CT2 has done very well, 
with  Revision  A and the first batch of Rev B both  selling  out,  and 
further production of Rev B to cater for demand. I get the feeling that 
we  really could have done with something like this a couple  of  years 
earlier,  as  the  next generation of TOS hardware is  finally  getting 
ready to do the doorstep challenge to a wider world.

I  also  can't  help thinking that Atari really should  have  made  the 
Falcon like this in the first place, as a large part of CT2 seems to be 
about putting right deficiencies left in the original Falcon design  by 
Atari Corp,  (you know, limited memory expansion potential, lack of big 
truecolour  screen  modes,  slow processor....)  Still,  it is  finally  
here, and it certainly lives up to its promise.

Well, let's see what Class 4/Centek can do with the Phenix next!

 CiH - August '99 for Maggie
