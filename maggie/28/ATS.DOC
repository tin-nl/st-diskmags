å
                                 By DHS
 
Easter 1999, somewhere in Dresden, a bevy of progress bars creep across 
a  big  screen,  a  roomful  of early morning  folk  are  paying  close 
attention.  One by one,  the bars stutter to a halt, soon, only two are 
left. Last-but-one grinds to an undignified halt. At its last gasp, the 
progress bar with 'DHS' written on it is triumphant!  This is the story 
of the winner that day.

ATS  was entered into the Error in Line competitions  (Falcon  section) 
with the lowest of expectations.  Hardly any new effects, although some 
pleasing variations of many old favourites,  indeed, this was described 
as leftover code for a bigger project which didn't get completed.

So, what do we see in front of us?

We  start,  get through the helpful (non joystick-assisted!) menu,  and 
plump  for  VGA 100 hz,  mainly because we can.  A whoosh announces the 
arrival of a fancy looking sunburst/splat funky DHS logo, the lettering 
all coils and twisted bands.

Nothing for a few moments.

 Then  some  slowly  building  music,   the  scene  is  still  dark.   A  
ball/tunnel  fuzzes  into life onscreen bouncing.  It is soon  overlaid 
with  another  bold  test  type 'DHS'  logo,  and  a  flare/sunspot  is 
independently  going up and down the screen too.  It soon turns into  a 
'double trouble' style tunnel effect.

The next bit is one of the closest to a new effect,  a bumpmapped face. 
Oh yeah, you cry, what's so original about that one? Well it isn't just 
any  old  bumpmap,  as a transparent 'overlay' version splits away  and 
wobbles doing its own thing on the screen at the same time as the  more 
conventional version of the bumpmap.

Sudden  change  as the music picks up with some punchy  greets  in  the 
mid-section  of  the  demo.  Lots of people and crews  are  named,  all 
guilty as charged! A bold ray casting effect goes well here. 
     
Pause  for  a  lovely Agent T designed static hi-res  picture.  It's  a 
favourite marine-themed scene, with all of his favourite deepest shades 
of blue.  A shark is hung forever on a split millisecond, ready to leap 
out  of  the water,  but kept from harming us in an iron cage of  fixed 
time.

Back to something more active, as we are rolling around on the beach in 
a 'zoom and rotate' that remains stuck on its side. Again there is some 
splitting  and  overlaying of transparent ghost copies  of  the  screen 
image involved.

Graphics and sound come together perfectly in another inspired Agent  T 
static  production,  this  time,  the famous competition winning 'Chuck 
Fuji'  picture,  timed to perfection with a metallic clang  closing off 
this main part of the demo.

There are only the end credits left now.  A change of mood and music to 
505's second-placed EIL tune,  and thus,  the end credits slowly scroll 
up over a neat zoom n' rotate Fuji.

The  somewhat  late night caffeine-fuzzed prose preceding  this  rather 
 more sensible paragraph does not really do justice to the good bits  of 
this  demo.   Tat  once  tried  to  distinguish  between  'design'  and 
presentation  of  a  demo.  With flawless execution of the  effects  on 
offer,   this  demo  has  presentation  in  boat-loads.  DHS  are  true 
professionals  at making old tired code (by their own admission!)  look 
really  good.  ATS  was polished,  and it shone beautifully.  An average 
demo was made to look a lot better than it might have done.

On reflection,  it only just deserved its win,  which was how it turned 
out!
 
Ratings..

Effects:-  78%  -   Seen most of it before,  more than  once.  Spark  of 
originality  with  the  bumpmap reinterpretation.  Also  marked  up  as 
spotlessly presented.
 
Graphics:-  85% -  High standard throughout,  a couple of great Agent  T 
static set-pieces.
 
Sound:- 84% -  Cool music, especially 505's end piece. 

Overall:-  82%  -   Strictly 'by the  numbers'  effort,  but  competent, 
flawless, and well put together.
