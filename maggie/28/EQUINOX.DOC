                                Equinox!

 The  ST  revival is upon us.  Not long after the triumphs of  Error  in 
Line,  a  mysterious  file  makes its way onto the Dead  Hackers  scene 
pages.  This  turns  out to be that rarest of sights,  a long lost demo 
that has wriggled its way off the development limbo of the coders  hard 
drive,  and makes its way into the daylight.  This escapee from Equinox 
briefly  set a new record for delayed release,  parts of it going  back 
six years. That is, until Torment and their 'Twitching Flannels' showed 
off  screens  that were even older!  What next,  an unreleased Level 16 
screen from 1987 perhaps?!

Enough of this, into the demo, which only needs a base 520 STFM to run. 
My STe also does it nicely.

It starts with a smack in the face, fast, even frantic soundchip music, 
running  at  double  speed to emphasise just how much  speed  they  can 
squeeze  from a humble ST.  A vertical and stony looking group logo  is 
up,  then a bunch of rapidly transitting flat 3D objects,  an awful lot 
of text, and a simple relief map of France, where Equinox come from, of 
course!

Next  up,  another.  more  complex 3D sequence,  more smoothness with a 
flat-shaded  solid 'Elite style spaceship sequence set against a  fancy 
rubble strewn background of the demo title. 

It is 'Full steam ahead!' a change of music, to something less coronary 
inducing.  A  couple  of raster shaded globes swirl around  the  screen 
briefly, giving way to a bunch of curvy bubble-snake patterns!

A  group of single colour balls merge to impose their presence  on  the 
different  parts  of  the  colour spectrum,  passing over  to  a  semi-
transparent  'devil ball' with stars,  which then goes all jelloid in a 
classic screen. Background is two part colour.

There is a calming still piccy with a fantasy theme, anachronistic in a 
demo, which is hugely dedicated to the idea of lots of sound and motion 
going  through  in a very short time.  Only a momentary change of  pace 
though, and a nice addition to this production regardless.

Some more technical goodness, an impressively huge dot ball, which then 
shows off a bit more by warping,  firstly into a dumb-bell double ball,  
and then a dot-torus!

One  which  hasn't  been  seen  on Atari,  and  bringing  a  breath  of 
originality to a demo otherwise mostly packed with reprisals of classic 
old effects, best described as a madly spinning silhouette cityscape!
 
 Following that, a 192 face or panel glenz vector ball shows off.

A touch of Japtro next,  with eleven individually rotating dotballs,  a 
taster for something really brilliant, coming just a little later.

Another change of speed,  as 'design' creeps in a little closer, with a 
group of cogwheels turning, whilst credits bounce off a jelly cube.

Coding goes mad again, with a huge number of small but perfectly formed 
vector  dot  globes,  these seem to have a little bit of  a  'blur-dot' 
effect,  and form up into a number of fantastic multiball shapes. It is 
a sequence nearly as involved as the classic Mindbomb demo 'Vectorball' 
screen, which was done with sprites!
 
 It  is smart fonts design time as the Equinox rollcall  is  broadcasted 
onscreen.  Back  to a coders delight screen,  as a huge vector dot cube 
warps and spins.

An early experiment with Motion blur, as a chequerboard effect solid 3D 
globe  blurs,  leaving  its  afterimage momentarily behind,  in a  good 
impersonation  of a high-persistence phosphor screen coating  that  you 
only used to find on very expensive monitors!

My personal favourite, and one which has an eerie echo in the 'DSP dot-
vector wasp screen' from the unfinished Falcon demo 'Motion',  a vector 
line bird in flight.  It has brilliantly simulated mechanics of flight! 
Truly,  something which we need to see more of.  The real rulers of the 
demo scene have managed to get something more 'organic' in their design 
than the standard procession of cliched 3D objects. Tat's enviro-mapped 
dolphin in Sono', need I say any more?

This is a hard act to follow,  the big motionblurred globe, doesn't try 
to,  but it starts the graceful gradual winding down process to the end 
of the demo.
 
 At last,  the endscreen is here,  with Mad Max,  the new SID generation 
playing in.  A dense starfield rolls endlessly forward, and end credits 
and greetings,  an equal mixture of 'old' and 'new' scene being greeted 
rolls upwards in a pretty font.

This  is a worthy survivor from demo days past.  It should have  surely 
rocked the joint if it had been released on time,  back in 1993.  As it 
is, Virtual Escape has weathered the long years very well indeed!

 Ratings.. 

 Effects:- 85% -  Mainly stock classics, but very well coded and superbly 
optimised. A couple of screens genuinely original.

 Graphics:- 88% -  All excellent, lots of attention to detail, and making 
it all hang together smoothly.

 Sound:- 85% -  Three great ziks,  Jedi coolness, and a welcome return of 
Mad Max!

 Overall:- 87% -  Fast, furious, and very very good!
