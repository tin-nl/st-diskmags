The future 'aint what it used to be!  Older readers among you, may well  
remember  the  sort of thing that got science fiction  writers  knicker 
elastic  wrapped tightly around their legs,  in a blood supply cutting-
off  sort of scenario.  The rest of you could do worse than to read the 
following gruesome extract below.

"By  the year 2000,  we will all be living on plastic bubble-like  dome 
houses on the moon,  eating a five-course banquet in pill form,  served  
up by our trusty domesticated ro-butlers!  Excitement for the family of  
the  year  2000 mounts steadily,  as they get ready for their  vacation 
trip to the rings of Saturn."

This  isn't quoted verbatim from anything in particular,  but I'm  sure 
that any reasonably widely read sci-fi fan has come across that sort of  
breathlessly  eager  tone  before.  What is interesting  is  that  most 
peoples  visions of the future are rooted very much in the  context  of  
the  present  day they are living in.  The above item  of  make-believe 
would  very  much  follow  on from the  high  excitement  of  the  60's 
moonshots,  for example,  where anything seemed possible, as long as it  
was covered in silver foil and glittery white paint.

One very well-known practitioner of the black art of hi-tech futurology 
is  Arthur.C.Clarke.  The high point of his vision came with the making 
of  the stars 'n stately motion movie epic "2001 a Space Oddessy".  The  
rather  drab  and disappointing light of the last thirty  years  hasn't 
dimmed  his  essential optimism and belief in  a  technological  future  
golden age.   

Indeed,  he's  been at it again recently,  predicting such things as an  
early discovery of a source of limitless cheap energy (Cold Fusion,  in  
the  first  decade  of the next century,) leading  on  to  the  frankly  
incredible  prediction that the invention of somewhat  Star-Trek  like'  
matter  convertors' will free the citizens of Earth from dependence  on  
Government and related institutions!
 
Now,  we figure at Maggie HQ,  it's time for him to be given a taste of 
our  satirical  medicine,  as  we reveal our alternative,  and all  too 
plausible guide to the 21st Century!

Starting with....

 The Year 2000, 1st January and all that Millenium stuff. 

For normal people who stay at home,  the millenium, and associated bugs 
pass  off with barely a flicker of a disturbed electricity supply.  For  
those  people with survivalist instincts who took to the  hills  before  
the  31st  December,  it  is  a  different story.  Due  to  a  horribly 
uncorrected bug in the stock ordering systems of various food retailers  
which  was  only put right at the last  minute,  carefully  pre-hoarded 
tinned food supplies have inadvertently passed their sell-by date by  a  
hefty margin, and these are now decomposing rapidly.

Eyewitness  reports (from a discreet distance) tell of the last  couple 
of  these unfortunates murdering each other in the Grampian region  for  
the sole remaining edible tin of Alphabetti Spaghetti.


 2001... 

Warfare  becomes  more  fun,  with the introduction of the first  of  a 
series of 'Happyware' munitions, the 'Whoopee fragmentation mine'. This  
clever  amalgam  of state of the art  engineering,  advanced  explosive 
technology,  and a wry sense of humour works by ejecting its payload to  
groin height when triggered, whereupon it detonates, shredding anything  
and  anyone  within  a 60 metre radius,  and letting  out  a  humourous 
'Phrrrt!'  noise at the same time.  People in trouble-spots around  the  
world fall over with laughter! (Or just fall over, perhaps?)

Also up for this year,  Windows 2000,  it's late,  bugged to shite, and 
demands a huge hardware and cost overhead from its users.  A critically  
neutered industry loves it,  of course. A series of logic bombs planted  
 by  disgruntled  Linux  users  go  off  and  cause  massive  damage  to 
complacent Windows users well-being, in spite of (hexadecimal) coded 30  
minute warnings being given.


 2005... 

Interest  in space issues burgeons,  as the International Space Station 
is  handed  over  to commercial  interests  by  increasingly  reluctant 
government  agencies.  It is to be henceforth known as the Asda  Cheesy  
Puffs Skytel Microsoft Pratts Best Liverwurst Space Station.

Some  tricky  negotiations are at the nigglingly  expensive  stage  for  
landing rights on the forthcoming Manchester United Moonbase.


 2010... 

To  a packed and expectant United Nations general assembly,  The  newly 
inaugurated  US  President,  Madonna,  announces  a new global  foreign 
policy initiative that "Bad things are very naughty and must not happen  
anymore." The rest of the world takes note and looks up for one moment,  
then its business as usual.

William Gates III is still the wealthiest man in the world even at this 
stage.  He is also one of the maddest,  uncannily apeing the 'dribbling 
into unkempt beard' antics of the very deceased Howard Hughes.


 2020...

 Windows  2010  is very late,  and the latest beta version now  occupies 
"More bytes of diskspace, then there are atoms in the entire universe!"  
according to Grand Clan leader, William Gates III.

Outmoded   and  irrelevant  notions  of  'choice',   'democracy',   and 
'objectivity',  are  outlawed in all countries subject to the Microsoft  
 techno-feudal yoke.

Sightings of dragons,  fireballs in the sky,  statues of Saint Diana of 
Windsor  weeping  blood,  and Elvis Presley singing a carefully  chosen 
medley of his greatest hits are all reported by a fearful populace.


 2030... 

Windows 2010 is still late,  but it hardly matters anymore as discarded 
and ancient methods of number crunching,such as bead abacuses and ZX81s 
are rediscovered and put back into use.

2030  is  very significant as the year in which contact with  an  alien 
species  from another world is made.  The magnificance of the  occasion  
diminishes  rapidly  as the purpose of their mission becomes  clear.  A  
threat of invasion is only averted when the leadership of Earth finally  
comes  across  with  the  cup of sugar  that  the  alien  high  council 
requested in the first place.


 2040... 

Windows  2010 finally released.  It is battling against the  widespread 
adoption  of  ninth-generation artificial  intelligence  based  systems 
which are sensibly put together, bug-free, and piss easy to use. To say  
it  is  as out of context as a flock of 1980s  New  Romantic  musicians 
desperately   clutching   crumblingly   ancient   parchment   recording 
contracts, is something of a bald understatement.

The  impact of an ageing population is brought home,  with the  Jaggers 
Day  riots  featuring  an unwanted side-effect  of  'Grey  Power'.  The 
distress caused to police forces across the world by the clearing up of  
huge  numbers of thrown and squashed colostomy bags is  unquantifiable. 
The smell lingers for some weeks afterwards too.


 2050... 

With  the opening of their millionth branch worldwide,  Harry Ramsdens, 
purveyors of quality fish and chips, becomes the number one global fast  
food retailer. A hostile takeover bid for McDonalds is soon underway.

There is a large earthquake somewhere.


 2060...  
 
One  of  the greatest unsolved mysteries of the  twentieth  century  is 
finally  solved.  What happened to those people left behind in  railway  
carriages uncoupled from the locomotive by the escaping protagonists in  
western movies with a train robbbery theme.

Once  they've gently glided to an engineless stop in the middle of  the 
desert,   they  sit  around  for  hours,  drinking  everything  vaguely 
alcoholic  in  the buffet car,  and bitching about the poor service  to  
anyone who will listen.

Quite simple really.


 2070... 

A  new  female  celebrity  unofficial  'fan'  website  debuts  on   the 
hyperinfonet. Nothing unusual about that, but this is the first time in  
eighty-odd  years  of internet access that the male maintainer  of  the 
site actually has a real life girlfriend! The other surprise is that it  
is balanced and intelligent in its choice of material, and isn't set up  
as some sort of weird and creepy training ground for would-be stalkers!

Millenial  angst for those people still using ancient Sumerian  tablets 
of stone for a calender starts about now.


 2080.. 

The  first viable robotic domestic assistant finally goes on  sale.  It 
can  handle over six million forms of communication,  lift a  Yorkshire  
Terrier with relative ease,  and leave the house sparklingly clean like  
the newest of new pins.  It has a pleasing deferential dumbness derived  
from a central CPU that performs like a pair of gumboots wading through  
treacle.

Sales  bomb  horribly  though,  when it is realised  that  the  factory 
settings  include a selection of German folk songs taken  from  ancient  
Yamaha home keyboards, which can't be turned off!


 2090.. 

The  last  two Atari Taiwanese manufactured grey  wedge-style  computer 
mice  in working order,  are sold at auction for $80 million each to an  
undisclosed buyer. Three months later, these turn up as the centrepiece  
of an exhibition of exciting new work by challenging young artists.


 2099.. 

The  future  suddenly switches into a heroic,  uncynical  and  forward-
looking higher gear.  Men are men, and boldy fly around in huge  space-
ships shaped like giant novelty bananas, a giant black monolith  shaped 
like a building society is found on one of Saturns moons, and  painting 
everything  in  a NASA style clinical shade of white comes  back   into 
fashion.  A pair of skeletal fingers is seen making a pointed and  very 
rude  gesture  along the lines of "I told you so!" from  the  grave  of  
Arthur.C.Clarke!

Everything looks fine and dandy now.  With a sense that everything from 
here  will be alright,  the trials and tribulations of the past century  
are put into a rather smug perspective by most people.

 
 2100.. (Midnight, and one second past.)

 Millenium  bug fix from the year 2000 is belatedly discovered  only  to 
have postponed things for 100 years!!
