 
I  found  this  fascinating tale of what one of  the  early  famous  UK 
Spectrum programmers had been up to,  whilst surfing one day. I thought 
it  was  too good to pass up the tale of what happened  to  the  'Manic 
Minor' (Big K magazine, 1985ish) since his 'Jet Set Willy' days.
 CiH - Sept '99
 
                 ‰Where is Matthew Smith?  Eh?? Eh?  EH??
 
It  was  one  of  the  main aims in life of  many  of  the  posters  to 
comp.sys.sinclair  to locate the whereabouts of Matthew Smith (if  only 
to obtain a copy of AOTMZFECFM or WMTT) until we found him.  The person 
claiming  to  be him (apologies to Matthew for the impolite  tone,  but 
fraudsters  are  rife) seems genuine,  so until proven otherwise,  I'm
prepared to stick my neck out and and say Yes!  It is him!!  Hurrah!!!

The  aim  of  this  page  is to log,  all in one  place,  any  and  all 
information  about  him.   As  to  the genuine-ness  of  any  of  these 
postings, I don't know.

But first...

 Who is Matthew Smith?  

Just  in  case you don't know who Matthew Smith is,  or know what a  ZX 
Spectrum is,  then this section is for you.  Matthew Smith wrote two of 
what  are  generally regarded as the best Spectrum games of  all  time, 
these  being ˆManic Miner  and ˆJet Set Will y,  all before he was 20.   He 
had  disappeared into obscurity,  so obviously fans of these games  are 
curious as to what he's up to these days, and if he's produced any more 
modern-day masterpieces.   His very absence elevated him to almost God-
like  status.

 What was he like?  

A  few  people  have  shared their experiences  with  or  knowledge  of 
Matthew...

 Bruce Porter swears the following on the bible... 

Hi, I have just been reading your Mathew Smith page. I knew him back in 
the  early  '80s via his sister (Michelle) ,  who I can probably  still 
contact  if neccessary next time I am in Wallasey.  I was there when he 
was designing Willy and helped out with some ideas for the levels , the 
Sky  Lab  Landing bay was mine ,  the toilet monsters were  his  little 
brothers who we used to wind up a lot. I was impressed the way he wrote 
it on a Tandy and then downloaded to the speccy as if it was a printer. 

        Yes  I am afraid he was into drugs ,  cannabis featured heavily 
in our lives back then (he used to make brilliant hash cookies), but he 
always  had  good deeds in him ( remember camping in  Anglesy  when  he 
annouuced  he had bought us all tickets to Roger Waters for that  night 
at the NEC,  15 of us,  and would take no money).  He experimented with 
drugs  like  the  rest of us,  dope ,  speed and acid.  It was when  he 
started to use cocaine and talk of heroin that I drifted away from  the 
group  we hung out with.  It was obvious then that he was going off the 
rails and family and friends were unable to to stop him. 

        I remember he built a chop once and rode it to the kent  custom 
show,  no MOT,  tax, insurance, license.  He was stopped after about 50 
miles.

        Last  time I saw Michelle she told me about the  institute  and 
that  he  had  left (got away?) and was indeed  in  Amsterdam.  So  the 
sightings of him there sound about right.

This is what a guy told me...

I hope this helps...

"I  last saw Mathew Smith at a Harrogate Acorn user show about 2  years 
ago. He was at the time working on the RISC user stand and commented on 
how  good  one  of my programmes was (His mag  had   just  reviewed  it 
(Although it was only an educational music game)). He look as if he had 
been enjoying his food a bit lately but otherwise seemed quite sane.  I 
noticed  his  name bage and thought "No it can't.." but I  asked  about 
with  several  other Acorn developers and they confirmed  that  it  was 
indead THE Mathew Smith!"

Mathew  smith  has  a semi scouse accent.  The area he  comes  from  is 
Wallasey  in the Wirral,  between Liverpool and Wales.  he did lose the 
plot  a  bit thanks to class a's but when i saw him  (couple  of  years 
ago)seemed  sorted  out'ish.  sat down with him he explained he's  been 
working  on a soccer game for ages.  I could not even believe i was  in 
his  lounge.  he  was  renting  a house with a teacher.  last  thing  i 
remember  him  telling me was that he was going to  move  to  amsterdam 
(good  move) and possibly had a job lined up in a fish factory.  all  i 
can say is that that upset me a bit and is a waste.

Its  not that I know him well,  just that a friend took me round to his 
house because he knew him. My friend knew that mat had written computer 
games,  but  had  no idea about computers and thus didnot know of  mats 
geneus.  I am not making this up because basically i have better things 
to  do and the most i know is that when i saw him,  about 2-3 years ago 
he was living in a shared house in wallasey village with a teacher. The 
air  was  smokey and mat and i were talking about circuits.  It was  at 
this  time i had a free radio station in Merseyside and he was  telling 
me  about some book he had with radio transmitter circuits in.  When  i 
brought  up willy/miner he went a bit quiet.  I asked what he was doing 
these days and he said he had been working on a real rules soccer  game 
for a few years.

If your putting any info on the net re: mat smith, please put in a note 
for mathew to get in touch with Woody. If he does so woody will give me 
a shout and i may reveal what is going on. got lots of work on, have to 
get this email/net thing at home!! all the best, keep the speccy alive

I  worked,  and  partied,  with Matthew a lot in 1984 during my time at 
Software Projects Ltd, Liverpool. Matthew, Marc Dawson [now of Software 
Creations] and myself were developing "Willy Meets The Taxman". Matthew 
had  'worked'  on  WMTT for months,  but had really done  nothing  (his 
recreational  activities prevented him from concentrating  for  periods 
longer than a few seconds).

Alan  Maton was the producer,  Matthew was the designer/director,  Marc 
was the programmer and I was the graphics artist -- you may be  shocked 
to  know that we were developing for the Commodore 64,  with a Spectrum 
third-party  conversion  to follow.  We were based at my house in  Holt 
Road  in  Birkenhead,  provided rent-free by Software Projects,  that I 
shared  with  Steve Wetherill [developer of JSW2,  and now of  Westwood 
Studios].

Marc and I were brought in to help Matthew deliver something, anything, 
to  meet  the  demand for a third Miner Willy  game.  Our  project  was 
cancelled  after  three  months -- all we had delivered  was  a  single 
screen.  WMTT was a raised view, rather than a sideways view game, with 
scrolling  as well as fixed screen levels.  Willy started at the bottom 
of  the  main access screen,  he had been redesigned to look like  more 
like Mario (we all loved Donkey Kong), and ran to the top of the screen 
where  there was excessive foliage and trees (inspired by Sabre  Wulf). 

On  his  way  up the screen Willy had to  avoid  'running  and  Cossack 
dancing' oak trees -- they were great. In the centre of the foliage was 
the  BanYan tree extending off the top of the screen,  and either  side 
were  three  paths  into the forest.  The idea was that  Willy  had  to 
complete  the six areas (in any order) by going down these  paths,  via 
this  screen,  collect  enough flashing pound notes and then climb  the 
BanYan tree -- where the next access screen,  with another set of paths 
off, would be.

Thinking  back,  WMTT  was quite a similar concept to the  later  Super 
Mario  Bros games on the NES,  although you could also run 'in to' (up) 
and 'out of' (down) the screen.

Marc  and  I left to help form Odin Computer Graphics,  where  we  were 
later  joined  by  Steve  Wetherill -- Nodes Of  Yesod  was  our  first 
published  title.  We  still  used  to go clubbing and  hang  out  with 
Matthew, although nothing lived up to the toga incident, but thing went 
rapidly downhill for him from there -- especially when Matthew Met  The 
Taxman.  Chris Cannon kept in touch with Matthew for years; but doesn't 
know where he is now.


 Conor McCarthy's sighting  

(http://www.jonlan.demon.co.uk/spectrum/matsmith/)  sounds  very   much 
like Matthew, especially the motor bike stuff. He really got into bikes 
after  JSW  --  I crashed his shiny,  new,  first motorbike the day  he 
bought it, oops!


 Chris Cannon sends.... 

It's true that I kept in touch with Matthew for ages,  but then he just 
seemed  to disappear off the planet about seven or eight years ago.   I 
did  hear a rumour that he'd changed his name by deed poll  to  Matthew 
From-Earth.   Sound's a bit strange,huh?  Well, it sounds like the sort 
of thing he'd do.

The last time I saw him,  he'd just been done by the police for driving 
an unlicenced motor vehicle whilst under the influence of alchohol.   I 
saw the offending vehicle - it was an old bicycle with a vacuum cleaner 
motor and car battery fixed onto it.   He was always doing crazy things 
like  that.  You  got used to it after a while!   Well,  that was about 
seven  or eight years ago as I said.   I've only heard bits and  pieces 
about him from mutual friends since.   The drugs story would seem to be 
a  likely  one,  although I can't actually see him using class 'A's  at 
all.  He was a pot-head, make no mistake, but I don't ever remember him 
taking anything else - except for copious amounts of beer.

If he ever does decide to get back in touch (Matt, if you're out there, 
my  parent's phone number is still the same!!) I'll let the world  know 
he's still alive via yourself.  If he wants me to, of course.

Many regards,

Chris Cannon

PS.  I now work in the same department in Royal and SunAlliance as Tony 
Milner  (one of the founders of Bug-Byte) who gave Matthew  and  myself 
our first jobs!  Small world, eh?

He continues later with...

PS.   Here's one for your Mat Smith page.   Manic Miner wasn't actually 
based  on  Donkey Kong as Alan Maton implies.   It was based  on  Miner 
2049'er - an Atari 800 game.   You can get a version for a Commodore 64 
emulator  if  you want to see or play it.   It was Matthew's  favourite 
game.  What he intended to do with Manic Miner was make it as much like 
Miner  2049'er as possible.  The original MM game spec had teleporters, 
lifts  and escalators in,  but Matthew decided to have lots of  screens 
rather than lots of fancy bits in.  (He was incredibly lazy,  and doing 
the game that way was a lot easier!)

                               ----v----

I recently heard of a Matthew Smith sighting,  a friend of a friend met 
a guy called Mat Smith in a commune in the Netherlands (?).  Seems he's 
now  a  motor bike mechanic.  The person who met him wasn't a  spectrum 
fan,  never having owned one, but Mat told him about how he "wrote some 
video  games  in  the  80's,  got  burnt out,  ended  up  in  a  mental 
institution".

The  date  was the end of Summer 1995,  and the place was in a  commune 
type   (possibly  hostel  style)  accomodation  in  Amsterdam  in   the 
Netherlands.  FOAF  (since  I can't remember his real name) met a  bike 
mechanic called 'Mat Smith',  in his late 20s. 'Mat' told him about how 
he recently recovered from drug problems, and was putting his life back 
together  after  spending some time being  treated  for  'psychological 
problems'.   He had written some video games for the ZX Spectrum in the 
'80s, and made a lot of money, got into drugs and .... hence the gap of 
several years.

Foaf was telling a friend of his about this, and having described 'Mat' 
as being quite large,  and dark hair/complexion,  concluded that it was 
in fact the Matthew Smith Of Miner Willy Fame.

 Thanks to Conor McCarthy for continuing our quest to find The Man.

 Chinese whispers,  eh?  Even in these days of wire and fibre,  you just 
can't  win.  I was just looking at your `Where is Matthew Smith?' page. 
You  see,  I am one of the F's in Conor McCarthy's mail about the  FOAF 
who  discovered Matthew's presence in the Netherlands.  Not the one who 
actually met the man, I'm afraid-- he doesn't have an Internet account, 
although  he finds it quite amusing that he managed to cause a stir  on 
the Net anyway without having one.

Sorry,  rambling.  There's  a  mistake in the mail Conor sent you which 
were  probably my fault as the story was related to me over a fair  few 
pints  in  my local (I actually dragged my mate back to  my  house  and 
showed  him MM and JSW.  His comment was something along the lines  of, 
`yeah, that's the sort of thing Matt would be into!')

Correction 
---------- 
My  mate didn't meet Matthew Smith in Amsterdam-- it was in Leiden  (or 
is  it  Leyden?  One's  in Germany and one's in the Netherlands  and  I 
always get confused.  The one in the Netherlands,  anyway) This commune 
was  fairly serious in that if you wanted to stay there for any  length 
of time, you had to provide your own living space. So the annexe of the 
house in which Matthew Smith lived was actually built by himself (don't 
think  it had ropes swinging from the ceiling or spikes on  the  floor, 
tho').  This  seems  to fit well with sentiments expressed  by  Matthew 
Smith  in the SU interview (which I'd read when it was first  published 
and all but forgotten).

I could probably pump my mate for the exact address,  but even assuming 
that  Matthews's  still  there,  I'd feel it would be something  of  an 
invasion  of privacy.  I got the impression from my mate's stories that 
Matthew  had  a fairly harrowing time of it and wants to  forget  about 
that part of his life.

Cheerio,

Ken Keenan


 This is also continued by Jan-Willem... 

Matthew Smith stayed in Anna's Leiden (commune) for quite some time.  I 
don't  know  the true story why he left,  but he then lived for half  a 
year in my friend's house in Voorschoten (near Leiden, Holland)  He had 
a  laptop  and  did some programming.In january he  had  to  leave  the 
Netherlands  because his stay was illegal.  He returned to England.  He 
also  had  an  internet account at XS4ALL.NL.  His  E-mail  adress  was 
earthman@xs4all.nl.  In  january  there was a big fire at Anna  Leiden. 
Anna  Leiden  is now completed destroyed.  The area is cleaned  up  and 
surrounded with fences.

 
Andy Noble has sent me this dubious (by his own admission) letter  that 
he received.  However, we now know that this is genuine.
 
Hi!

Ran across your page after the Electronic Telegraph article.

You  may have seen/played the version of Manic Miner for the PC I  did. 
Yes?  No?

Oh well. :)

Anyway  after  several months of its distribution on the  Internet  the 
inevitable happened.

I  don't believe it is real but you never know.  A part of you  screams 
out  that it is total fabrication but just a small part,  a very  small 
part  keeps  poking you in the ribs saying "I could be  you  know!".  I 
doubt it but what the hell, I though you should at least see it.

I showed it to Andy Davis of Alchemist Research who thinks the same  as 
I do.

Right I will shut up and let you have a read. I did respond to the mail 
but never got anything in return.  It did come on the 25/5/98 which, if 
I can remember,  was a bank holiday Monday so someone could easily have 
had a few beers before sending :)

Dear Andy,

        I am just back on the Net after a long absence.  I searched for 
mention of myself and my early work.   I was directed to your page.   I 
downloaded MANICU10.EXE and played the first few levels.   I plays just 
like the original and was a fine conversion.   I started it first under 
Win3.1 and it IDed my SB 16 stereo then crashed to EMM protection.  Now 
I start from DOS the sound is gone.   There is no scrolling message, no 
dancing willy.  My SB is at A240 I5 D1 H5.  I have a 486SX with 8Mb and 
dodgy DMA.  I shall let you know if reinstalling helps.

        I was a trifle alarmed to see copyright notices on my work  but 
I don't think it is worth my while sueing anyone at this stage.  If the 
game  has  genuinely passed into the public domain then I  am  OK  with 
this. Whoever granted rights to Alchemist Research were misrepresenting 
themselves  and I hope no money changed hands.   Bug Byte and  Software 
Projects only manufactured under license and have both ceased  trading. 
I was a director at Software Projects when the company was wound up.  I 
am still owed muchos denarios so let me know if Sega or Nintendo get in 
touch.

        I  have  been programming off and on since then but  I  haven't 
reached version 1.0 on anything.   I was told we had secured the Warner 
cartoons  so  I started a Roadrunner and Wile E Coyote game.  In a  few 
weeks  I  had the finest multi-level sideways  scrolling  road  program 
possible  on  the Speccy.  I also learned that the Warner  license  was 
vapour.   I  tried  to finish the game as Attack of the  Mutant  Zombie 
Flesh-Eating  Chickens from Mars but the Speccy market was  waning.   I 
accepted  my partners arguments that they had the Amigas  because  they 
needed  to play while I needed to concentrate.   When they wouldn't let 
me have an ST as good as theirs we parted company.

        I did Manic Miner in a Gem Window in GST C.…(!! - CiH note)   The 
game  was finished and working but GEM was too horrible to work at  the 
same  time.   I  did  learn  how  to  program  dodgy  GUI  event-driven 
catastrophes though so Windows is a doddle now.   My Win ref book is in 
Dutch  but it makes sense to me.  I had v0.8 on a Footy game on the  ST 
(asm  (GENST2)),  v0.3  on  a Road-Rash/Doom/Frontier combo on  the  PC 
(TCv2.0(nice but no EMS or XMS)).  The disks from all these have passed 
away.

        I had started to write a programming tool that was ahead of its 
time  in  1986  and  I have since seen Windows  evolve  into  the  user 
interface  that  my program had.   I have stopped tearing my  hair  out 
though as Win lacks the guts of my basic idea.   I am doing it as a Win 
App instead.   I have Qbasic,  VB4 and various shareware ASM's and C's.  
I  left my TC2 in Nederland so I have no reliable C++ compiler.   Basic 
is fine for the prototype but a trifle slow and Qbasic is full of  bugs 
and omissions and VB won't do ASM routines.  As more parts of my system 
work though it will all come together.   My tool is powerful.   My tool 
is Bad. My tool is enough to make governments mad.  If we can come to a 
non-  disclosure  agreement  then I could let you Beta as  soon  as  it 
appears to do something useful.

                                        Yours faithfully,

                                           Matt Smith
