 
This  was once going to go into the sadly non-appearing 'Rant  Mag',  a 
production  of superior forms of weirdness.  As this article managed to 
live  through various hardware upheavals,  I thought I'd celebrate  its 
survival here in Maggie.

Foreign  readers  note:-  Ferraro Rocher is a form  of  chocolate  sold 
mainly  as  a  cheaper  form  of  gift  marketed  under  some  mistaken 
'exclusive' label.   CiH - Sept '99

 "If  music  is  the  food of love,  I'd seriously  think  about  buying 
yourself some new strings for that guitar if I were you.."

                  ‰Ferraro Rocher, Three of the worst..  
 
 Now  I  don't know when Steve is planning to bring out  this  'rantmag' 
special,  but I'm writing this in early November, that pre-Xmas period, 
where  we're not getting the full blasts of holly and tinsel just  yet, 
but  about  half  the ads on telly are for crap  and  uninspired  'gift 
ideas' for people you don't see very often, or like very much..

Now  one  familiar  face  is popping up  at  this  time,  the  greatest 
chocolates ever made,  oh, should that be the most intensively packaged 
boxes of chocolates ever made?

Yes,  it's  Ferraro  Rocher time,  those sweetmeats sold on a  mistaken 
'glamour'  ticket..  Just  what ambassador has these at his  reception, 
when  everyone  very  well  knows that these  chocolates  are  sold  to 
give to millions of suburban mums across the world?

(Actually, the Peruvian ambassador does... Which is worrying..)

Ferraro Rocher have done three adverts so far, or two, with variants on 
the main one.. Let's take a closer look..


 'The Ambassadors Reception, Version 1.0' 
 
This  was  the original cringe-maker,  which has been around for a  few 
years  now,  most often shown in the run-up to Xmas period,  where they 
can expect the maximum number of seasonal sales..

The  scene  is an unknown diplomatic reception,  an  unknown  gentleman 
wearing  a big girly red sash,  but who is of southern mediterranean or 
general  latin  looks,  waves his butler on..  Awful tinkly plop  piano 
music starts as a hugely piled pyramid of the comestible in  question.. 
All  the women at the party for some reason start  babbling  excitedly, 
culminating  in some overblown blonde french tart gushing  "Weeth  Zeez 
Ferraro  Rocher,  you are spoileeng uzz!" - Which was almost  certainly 
dubbed on afterwards..

Kack  Rating:-  95% - Truly awful,  about as convincing as  a  Carry-On 
film..  Come  to  think,  I've  often admired Kenneth Williams for  his 
gritty, documentary like realism, compared with this..


 'What's going on in the back of the Bentley?' 

A second and totally different,  but equally cringe making production.. 
This  seems  to  be  one  for the  'out  of  season'  months  when  the 
ambassadors  parties  are in recession,  and redefines the  meaning  of 
'travel sweet'.. The setting is a posh car, less overblown woman in the 
back,  sort  of like a young Joan Collins type who can never finish her 
sentences, and telepathic chauffeur in the front..

As if propelled by the art of bad prop-making and the same damned awful 
music  first heard at the ambassadors party,  a plate of our  favourite 
chocolate  wobbles  out of the rear glove compartment  to  the  evident 
delight of her in the back..

What  we aren't shown is what happened immediately after they went  out 
of camera..

"Mmm, I'm feeling....!"

"Whipped cream and studded leather restraints on standby madam...!!!"

(Chauffeur  drives Bentley into lamp post,  chauffeurs face smacks into 
steering wheel.)

Kack Rating:- 85% - Not much better,  and only really partially rescued 
by   the   unspoken  salacious   off-camera   possibilities   discussed 
immediately above.. 


 'The Ambassadors Reception, Version 1.5' 

This  is a reworking of the old version 1.0,  produced in time for  the 
Xmas '97 chocfest.. 

Some  things  have  stayed the same,  the ambassador  is  still  there, 
complete  with  red  sash,  the  music is the  same  awful  naff  piano 
concoction,,  The  structure  of the advert hasn't  changed..  However, 
there have been changes made to some of the other supporting personnel, 
the  over-accented bimbo has been mercifully carted away,  ("Weeth zeez 
white  coat,  you  are restraineek meee!") and we get a  chinese  woman 
speaking  her appreciation in what is presumably,  chinese..  The other 
woman  who speaks,  is somewhat less bonkers and more underplayed  than 
the original..

The new twist to this is to guess what the chinese woman is saying, for 
all we know,  she could be saying "I prefer oral sex to Ferraro Rocher, 
actually!" Which is fair enough..

Kack  Rating:- 90% - Only marginally improved by cosmetic tinkering  to 
the  completely  naff  version  1.0..  However,  there  are  subversive 
possibilities  introduced by the introduction of a character who  could 
be  confessing  a  liking  for  something  somewhat  saltier  than  the 
oversweetened confection currently under consideration..
