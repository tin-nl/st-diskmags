
                 ‰The Xmas Intro DHS Online Competitions!
 
       And remember, a Xmas intro is just for Xmas, not for life!
 
One  of the Atari world's seasonal rituals re-presents itself,  just in 
time for the festive season. Briefly consider and discard them, or hate 
them,  Xmas intros simply can't be ignored.  So this year, Evil took it 
on  himself  to  try to channel the Xmas intro  writing  activity  into 
something  more coherent and meaningful,  with the latest of his online 
competitions. Did he succeed? Well, read on and judge for yourself.


   The Crimbo Intro, by Torment 

First  out  of the box this,  thanks to the efforts of the revived  UK-
based  ST  demo  super-group(?) Torment.  This is an  almost  defiantly 
modest effort, consisting of a brief intro of several pretty fonts, and 
a  main  screen.  In  this main screen resides a snowman,  and a  never 
ending  (or  melting)  cascade of snowflakes which  come  to  rest  and 
accumulate on the little icy fella. A scroller at the top of the screen 
adds its sparse garnish to the proceedings.

There  is  also a nice and original soundchip tune,  made of purest  YM 
tones  and burbles,  which has a Xmassy theme (touch of Jingle Bells in 
there),  and  wraps several times whilst reading the scrolltext,  which 
isn't  a world breaker,  but plenty long enough.  This one really isn't 
friends  with  a Falcon and needs a hard reset (such as a  hammer?)  to 
quit it.

It  isn't a world-shattering epic,  like most of the other xmas intros, 
but a nice little screen nonetheless.


  Two in One, by DHS 

This one is the best of the bunch,  with several good reinterpretations 
of  classic and newer effects,  often all at the same time.  The title, 
'Two in One',  gives the theme of this intro away, showing a mixture of 
old (recycled!) effects from 1990-era demos,  with current ones such as 
the rather overworked, but made immortal by DHS, texture tunnel.

The  first  sequence illustrated this perfectly,  displaying old  style 
line  vector  objects  and  new  style  tunnels  separately,  and  then 
together.  To  fill  you in textually,  there is a stark but  effective 
Cream-style font over the top of the effects, which fades in and out to 
introduce the demo.

Actually,  there isn't a lot about Xmas in this intro, but in their one 
concession to the season,  DHS give us a Xmas card onscreen, which then 
bump-maps,  brilliantly.  The bump-mapping is virtually Falcon quality, 
even on an ST!

Next  up,  a bit of the old,  with some coloured pseudo-3D vector balls 
(remember  Mindbomb?) These buckle and distort nicely,  when they crash 
into the border at the sides of the screen.

A bit more of the new,  with a lovely colourful 'Rosette' blur.  Again, 
close to Falcon quality, maybe with slightly chunkier pixels.

Old stuff again, a bunch of 3D line vector objects paraded on.

Finally,  an oldish looking 'star-swirl tunnel',  not out of place,  in 
something like the Union demo, and numerous greets to comclude it.

The design and execution are typical DHS high quality. You don't expect 
or get a poor demo from them. Even the music, a  soundchip tune, starts 
as an old style YM plunkfest, then it rapidly picks up contemporary SID 
overtones,  all masterly done by DMA-SC.  The rest of the intro,  code, 
graphics etc, are mainly done by Evil, with some other (older?) code by 
Bellman.

Interestingly,  there  isn't  that  much  difference in  how  the  demo 
operates  from a 50 mhz CT2 to a bog-standard 8 mhz STe!  (there may be 
some  quicker transitions between different parts of the intro  on  the 
CT2, but nothing to tell them apart on the main screens.

My  conclusion,  this  definitely  the best of the bunch  for  1999,  a 
superior Xmas intro verging on a good mainstream effort.


  Tnhxmas, by TNH 

This third effort goes a little bit further with the music.  There is a 
modfile,  in  a  techno  Xmas  style,  using an old Amiga  sample  set, 
composed by Tinker.  (I shouldn't try to think about that one too hard, 
just get the demo and listen to it!)

Apart  from  that,  a bit of a feast of 'bugger-all' really.  An  intro 
screen  (half-done,  according  to the scrolltext),  and a main  screen 
consisting of a slow plain scroller, a few (small) background graphics, 
and some greetings in a traditional Dutch Xmas card style.

Not a lot else, this was a bit of a rush job?

This intro has the same brief impact that getting a Xmas card has, nice 
to hear from the sender, but then you put it with the others and forget 
about it.


  Xbiosmas, by Blind Io 

This  is  very 'oldskool' indeed,  the design for this single  screener 
does  not have a single idea in it that was seen again after  1990.  ST 
nostalgia is still here, and it now wears tinsel!
 
We're  going  straight  back to 10 years ago,  this is Xmas  1989,  but 
possibly not Xmas 1999?  In a fit of modernity, it has been verified as 
running on ST, STe and Falcon. It even quits out nicely to the desktop, 
which is something old demos almost never did! 

Still, it's good to see old friends again. For this intro, we are given 
a  multi-layer,  multi-actioned  screen.  Centre-screen.  a  Santasleigh 
sprite flies perpetually through a left-right scrolling starfield. Just 
above a three layer parallax forest of treetops.

At the very top, is a cute remnant of early TEX demos, it's the famous, 
and  seasonally camouflaged barrel scroller with  assorted  greeetings, 
and finally,  at the bottom, a big scrolltext reminiscent of just about 
every demo released a decade ago.

A cosily familiar Big Alec tune provides the soundtrack.

This one is a real Xmas cracker blast from the past!

 
Well, that was the batch for 1999, wasn't too bad, was it?

I'm  sure  there still will be one or two  'unplanned'  releases,  even 
after this competition, especially around the festive season itself.

There  was also a non-musicians modfile competition,  but I'm drawing a 
veil over that one,  as I submitted another entry to it, in a spirit of 
'It sounded good about nine years ago when I composed it,  and I'm sure 
people will vote for it' Then I smelt the coffee and woke up!

Just left to someone to organise a happy new year competition?
