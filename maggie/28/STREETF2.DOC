      A strange little something pulled together by Patrice Mandin

Okay,  I'll  lay it down straight for you people.  You remember 'Street 
Fighter  2',  the famous SNES beatemup.  You remember the computer game 
and console versions spawned from that success all those years ago.

Think 'US Gold'...

Think 'Licenceware'...

Think 'Not very good'...

And  you have the official ST version of that licence.  it was produced 
almost  at the very end of the ST's mainstream commercial life,  and at 
that stage, software houses really didn't care what they kicked out, as 
long as it managed to bear a vague resemblance to the real thing.

To  be fair,  it was sort of alright,  if you remembered that it ran on 
the  lowest  common  demoninator hardware.  No attempt  being  made  to 
recognise the STe for example.

Now,  what  seems to have emerged blinking into the harsh daylight from 
the  earthquake  wrecked club 'development nullity'.  is just  such  an 
enhancement, an STe version of Street Fighter 2!

This  isn't  an official project,  needless to say,  but an old  (1994) 
attempt  by Patrice Mandin to convert the game to run on  the  enhanced 
machine.  It  also quite likes a Falcon '030,  and runs happily on that 
machine.  There  is  also a True colour version which runs as a  Falcon 
only proggie.

The  differences from the official US Gold version are technical,  with 
parallax   hardscroll,   blitter   assisted  pixel  precise   collision 
detection,  even 'ripped from the SNES' DMA sample sound support. At 50 
frames per second on a Falcon, it is very smooth indeed.

It is also very incomplete,  existing as a concept tester.  The colours 
are  sixteen colour greyscale,  a graphics mode unique to the STe.  The 
Falcon  has  full colour and fullscreen graphics,  but these  are  very 
buggy,  with  incomplete  screen  clearing,  with after-images  of  the 
sprites not clearing.

The  fighters  are two of the same characters,  a siamese  'evil  twin' 
Chung  Lee taking on her better intentioned sister,  there is only  one 
level,  and although the energy status bar counts down,  the characters 
don't die until the very final sanction of the space bar is invoked.

It  is strange that this hasn't been seen until recently,  but it could 
be down to us not paying sufficient attention? With Patrices other game 
projects  (Doom  et  al)  on the go,  I'm not  sure  how  much  further 
development  this  one  is going to get beyond the  basic  game  engine 
demonstrator that we've got at the moment?

It  would be nice to see if anything else does arise,  as Patrice says, 
it does show what the STe is capable of with a minimum of effort!
