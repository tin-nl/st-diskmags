
                  ‰Modest - a small demo by Mind Design
 
You have to say that this demo is unlucky in its timing.  There is such 
a  thing  as  'old,  but not old enough' Confused?  Well,  I'll try  to 
explain.

The  acceptable definition of ageing in demo terms,  is when  something 
gets  to  be  so old,  that the nostalgia or 'cult' factor  from  times 
remembered in the past kicks in.  Some prime examples of this were with 
the  recent DHS Xmas intro competition screens,  Blind Io's  'Xbiosmas' 
surely  didn't have a single drop of new design or ideas in it,  but it 
somehow worked because of the retro factor.

Where  things  start  to look merely 'late' instead of  'cult',  is  if 
something  has  been hanging around for a year longer  than  it  should 
have,  and starts to get overtaken by the very newest ideas and coding. 

Bearing  in  mind  that this was intended for release as  a  96ktro  at 
Quast98,  but  only  finished  in time for EIL '99,  does it manage  to 
sidestep that 'late' label?

Running  the intro reveals that it is RGB only,  or VGA,  if you really 
like  a  cocked up screen mode.  The 'feel' of the design  is  slightly 
dated,  but  not  too much so,  as a series of titles and credits punch 
their way on the screen in time to the Viking created music.

The demo decides to be 'Modest' in nature, and what you get are a short 
series of well defined effects, not earth shattering, but nicely done.

First up,  the most modern effect,  a tunnel.  Nothing you haven't seen 
before,  in  fact something you've seen quite a few times before.  Nice 
and   quick   though,   and  cheerful  bright   yellowey-red   textures 
predominate.

A bump-map next,  quite a neat lightshow, set against the 'Mind Design' 
title/logo.

Following that, are blobs, lots of them. These are blue and bright, and 
spin  around  against  a  dark background.  One of  the  visually  more 
interesting screens.

The  most technically interesting effect was saved to last.  This is  a 
phong shaded ball,  or potato-shaped lump.  Looks quite effective,  and 
uses  many weird and interesting parts of the colour palette  to  shade 
it.  A fairly unadorned screen,  which could have used a bit of further 
development, then it could have been a great screen?

This  is the end of the demo proper,  a series of smart minature images 
of  the  screens  we've just seen,  are flashbacked to us,  as if  we'd 
already forgotten. Which we haven't.

This  was  over very quickly,  the demo certainly didn't lack  pace.  I 
would have liked some of the effects to have been developed a bit more. 
It had dated a little bit,  especially against the other EIL entries on 
show last Easter. Still, a good effort from all concerned.

The  Phong-ball  at the end couldn't help but remind me of  the  Sentry 
effort at Symposium '96. If 'Modest', complete with the more up-to-date 
effects (for then) had somehow been released there, it would have wiped 
out the lacklustre 96ktro category.
 
Ratings..

Effects:- 73% -  Seen them before generation of effects,  but Phong Ball 
still only rarely done on Atari.
 
Graphics:- 78% -  Good presentation, not too many of them. 

Sound:-  74%-  Decidedly older Amiga style modfile which brought on  the 
Symp '96 flashback!
 
Overall:-  77% -  Over too quickly,  could have done with lingering on a 
couple of the screens, maybe taking them on a bit further?

 CiH, Dec 24th 1999!
 
Twas  the  night before Xmas (5.00am),  and all around,  rain and gales 
shook the house!
