              ******************************************

                          SPRING/SUMMER 1999 
                          ******************

ASP  is  proud to announce its current range of hardware  and  software 
solutions for the Atari ST/TT/Falcon and Amiga ranges of computers.

Available now: 
**************

MouseBurster  Mk2:  Following on from the success of the  MouseBurster, 
the  Mk2 adds AMIGA compatibility to the wealth of features  previously 
only  available  to  Atarians.  MouseBurster Mk2 allows  virtually  any 
Serial  Mouse  or  alternative to be plugged into  the  MOUSE  PORT  of 
virtually  any  Atari  ST/TT/Falcon  or  Amiga  computer.  No  software 
drivers,  compatible  with all software so far tested (Includes Cubase, 
Notator,  Calamus etc). Suitable (Mouse Systems) Mice may be set to use 
the middle button as a double-click, Netmice may use the browser button 
for Click-and-hold as well as double-click..... 

MouseBurster  Mk2 is priced at 19 UKP inc postage etc.  Suitable  mice, 
trackballs and touchpads are available from 4 UKP upwards.

STartIDE:  Internal  fitting ST IDE host.  It is possible to fit a 2.5" 
hard-drive  internally in the STF/FM and STe (two variants  available), 
and  these  kits  allow you to do so.  No external wiring  or  trailing 
cables needed.   Compatible with AHDI,  CBHD and HD-Driver. Tested with 
Cubase  and  other  MIDI  software.  Works with  ATAPI-IDE  CDROM's  if 
suitable  driver  software  is used.  TOS 2.06 is provided  for  either 
machine type to enable auto-booting of the drive with the supplied AHDI 
6.06 hard drive utility software.

   Prices  from  50  UKP  for  the  interface,   full  fitting  service 
available,  contact ASP for details, typical costs would be 110 UKP for 
 full fitting inclusive of 60 Mb drive and return of the machine.

IDE-Burster:  For  all Atari Falcon and Amiga computers with a 2.5" IDE 
interface,  this  small plug-in module gives you  a full-size 3.5"  IDE 
output.  Supports  all IDE hard-drives so far tested,  and will support 
ATAPI  compliant  IDE CDROM's with suitable  driver  software.  Various 
options are offered, from the bare interface through kits to mount 3.5" 
drives  internally in stock Falcon's (and possibly Amiga's) through  to 
fully  installed 3.5" 4.2Gb drive conversions for the Falcon.  The only 
software that currently seems to be happy with such huge IDE drives  on 
Atari's  is  HD-Driver.  This has been tested back to version 4.61  and 
works  fine.  Both AHDI and CBHD can have problems with drives this big 
on IDE.

   Prices  range from 6.5 UKP for the bare drive,  8 UKP for the kit to 
fit  a  single drive internally,  8 UKP for the kit to fit  two  drives 
(normally  for use on recased machines),  85 UKP for the 4.2Gb internal 
conversion  for the Falcon as a kit and 110 UKP for your Falcon  fitted 
with a 4.2Gb drive at ASP and returned. All prices inc postage etc.

SCSI-Burster:  The  original  ASP product and still going  strong!  The 
classic solution to all the cable spaghetti caused by a multiple  drive 
SCSI set-up,  this cable turns a PC case (Desktop,  tower or minitower) 
into a SCSI box capable of supporting up to seven SCSI devices. Lots of 
optional extras (extra length,  more internal and external connectors). 
Supports  ICD Link2 type external SCSI hosts as long as compliant  SCSI 
drives  are used,  and will also work with ADSCSI type internal  hosts, 
remember  to remove the 12V line from the floppy connector you  use  to 
power the ADSCSI with though! 

Prices  start at 18 UKP for the basic 3-drive model,  write  (enclosing 
SAE),  email  or  phone for quotes for custom units.  Typical price...5 
internal  drives  supported  on an extra 60cm of cable:  24  UKP;  four 
internal  drives  and an extra external connector  (SCSI-out)  with  an 
extra 30cm of cable: 30 UKP. All prices inc postage etc.

PSU-Burster: The easy and cheap way to replace those hard-to-find Atari 
 power supplies!...This cable plugs into the motherboard connections  of 
a  standard  PC-AT (not ATX) power supply to allow it to  power  up  an 
Atari ST or Falcon. If used with a standard case then the PSU will have 
to be mounted externally,  however it can be used in conjunction with a 
SCSI-Burster as it utilises the otherwise unused motherboard connectors 
on the PSU.  PSU-Burster ST and PSU-Burster Falcon (state which variant 
required) cost 6.5 UKP inclusive of postage etc...

ST-VGA:  This small converter plugs between the Atari ST monitor output 
and  a standard SVGA (or VGA) monitor.  This gives you a  hi-resolution 
monochrome  monitor that is both bigger than the standard Atari  SM124, 
has  a  tilt-swivel  base and is easily  replaced  or  upgraded.  Fully 
compatible with Cubase,  Notator,  Calamus,  Pagestream,  and all other 
mono software.Note:  Some old VGA monitors will not work with an ST-VGA 
as  they  are  unabe  to sync to the  high-speed  refresh.  All  modern 
monitors,  eg: Gateway Crystalscan, Hitachi MVX, NEC MultiSync etc will 
work. ST-VGA costs 15 UKP inclusive of postage etc

COMING SOON: 
************

Universal  PC keyboard/mouse interface for Atari's.  This is a  totally 
new product from the designer of the wonderful MouseBurster....it  will 
allow  the  use  of  a  PC AT  keyboard  with  all  Atari  ST/TT/Falcon 
computers.  Also  acts as a host for either a PC Serial or Atari mouse. 
Available early Summer 1999. Prices TBA at the moment, phone/write (SAE 
please) or email for details.

ALSO AVAILABLE 
**************

ASP  is  dedicated to the survival of the Atari computers as  the  only 
sensible  MIDI  platform  for the musician on a budget.  We  provide  a 
helping  hand  wherever we can and supply such useful  items  as  hard-
drives (120Mb SCSI from 12UKP) CDROM's (8x SCSI for 30 UKP inc  drivers 
and  CDROM  of shareware etc) and second user  Atari  hardware  (floppy 
drives,  keyboards  etc) as well as SIMM's (4x1Mb SIMM's for STe for 10 
 UKP)  and  other generic items.  Second-user serious (and even the  odd 
game) software also sometimes available.

ASP BACK-UP SERVICE 
*******************

We can back-up your hard-drives to CDROM. Typical prices start at about 
10 UKP for up to 200 Mb on a single drive. Copyright restrictions apply 
to all software copied. This is for owner's back-up only and may not be 
distributed  after the event.  Back-up is via SCSI transfer and not  by 
ISO-9660  unless requested.  Back-up is done with Atari machines  using 
SoundPool  CDR  software.  This service is available for all  machines, 
SoundPool CDR doesn't appear to need to be able to recognise the  hard-
disk  format in order to copy it faithfully to CDR,  however recognised 
partitions and drives with unrecognised formats must be less than 650Mb 
otherwise data-loss may occur.
