              A new DMA Modfile player for Atari Computers

By RGF Software . .  (Version 1.2)
 
I  once knew a bloke called Richard Gordon at school,  I bet it  wasn't 
him  who  did  this though.  He didn't have Faika as a last  name,  and 
wasn't a German national, not as far as I knew at least.

 This is something of an unusual event,  a new GEM-based modfile player, 
which purely uses the DMA sound hardware,  as seen (heard!) in the STe, 
TT,  and Falcon. A useful addition to your audio armoury perhaps, or is 
it merely reinventing the wheel?

The  interface is the near-universal CD player console used many  times 
before, experienced readers may well remember Flaysid and Megaplayer?

It has a nice colourful post-modern GEM style,  and has a little bit of 
visual 'zing' in the form of indicator bars at the side of the display. 
An  extra  panel opens out at the bottom revealing extra  functions  on 
display  for elapsed time a modfile has been playing,  the track number 
etc,  pointing  towards  a  discreet playlist function,  accessed by  a 
couple of extra buttons,  and which can look in a given directory, able 
to access all the mods that are there. There also seems to be an option 
for an external sound module apart from the internal DMA sound?
 
In operation,  it really needs a higher resolution.  It looks and works 
better  in  VGA type modes,  IE,  vertical resolution of 400 pixels  or 
more.  It  does  function  in lower screen modes,  ST low or medium  or 
equivalents,  but the buttons are largely obsured and difficult to make 
out. It looks and works fine in ST mono by the way.

To  see  how your machine performs or struggles,  there is a handy  CPU 
progress  bar.  It  is  reasonable with cpu time on  the  '030  powered 
Falcon,  with  25-40% cpu useage typical on a standard 16 mhz Falcon at 
the highest 50 khz replay rate. 

The  all-important  sound replay quality is very good  on  the  Falcon, 
especially  at  the  top replay rate.  We would assume that  the  sound 
matrix  on the Falcy helps to smooth things out too?  There is a choice 
of lesser freqencies.  from 6.25 khz (STe only),  12.5 khz,  and 25 khz 
too.

The STe copes up to a point. It manages a respectable 50% cpu useage at 
25  khz.  However,  it  runs  out  when asked to play at  50  khz,  and 
registers its discontent by missing out a couple of the sound channels! 
It should be able to manage the lot with a bit more power, say a 16 mhz 
Mega  STe,  or Veloce powered STe.  The meatier TT would take it all in 
its stride. 

It should function in a modern multi-tasking environment such as Magic. 
There  is  even an option to let it play in the  background  if  multi-
tasking is available.  In practice, it seems to be unwilling to do this 
on  my  Falcon/Magic 6 combination.  In this case it goes  through  the 
motions  but  produces  no sound,  and the timer acts like it  has  got 
stuck? In theory, it should be possible to use this in conjunction with 
program  that uses the DSP on the Falcon,  say a picture displayer that 
uses it for depacking.  There are still bugs being worked out and there 
may be a problem with Elly running under Magic 6?

I  tried it as an accessory in single TOS.  No luck there either as  it 
loaded in but came up with the stark message 'No system Dialog'!

It  is  a  bit  limited in other ways too,  as it can  only  play  very 
standard  4 channel protracker tunes.  At this stage there is no multi-
channel  option  available,  and no exotic PC style formats either.  We 
wait to see what later versions might bring?

In conclusion,  the optimum use for it may not be on the Falcon,  which 
has many DSP-based alternatives, but for the TT and Mega STe, where the 
modern GEM display would complement a higher spec desktop.

 Advantages..
Neat and well featured GEM interface.
Good replay quality at 50 khz.
Compatible across a wide range of Atari Computers. (With DMA sound)
Should be compatible with multi-tasking systems.
Frees up DSP for other roles on the Falcon.
Nice 'play all the mods in a given directory' option.

Disadvantages..
Only four channel Protracker as an option.
Runs out of breath on lower powered machines.
Crabby display at lower screen resolutions.
Multi-tasking seems to be a bit awkward in reality?
No accessory option for single TOS.
