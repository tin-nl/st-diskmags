    All the bits that are nice, but too small to run on their own.

 It's the Jar-Jar Binks caught wearing nothing but a whispy G-string and 
a  suggestive  sneer being mercilessly exposed to  the  tabloid  press, 
Phantom Menace styled column again! I see those headlines now.

 "Crap CGI Alien sidekick in Rent Boy outrage!" 

Speaking of which,  even before the hyped but hapless instalment of the 
Star  Wars saga,  told in a back-to-front fashion,  is cold in its box, 
rumours about part II float around. Some of these may even become true?

                           Believe it or not?

 The second instalment is darker than the first,  but not as dark as the 
third is going to be?

Leonardo de Caprio has been approached to play the 20 year old  version 
of Anakin Skywalker?

He has refused?

There will be a villain as significant as Darth Maul for this episode?

This may even be Darth Maul somehow surviving the first episode?

Anakin  Skywalker is tipped over into embracing the dark side,  when he 
blames the Jedi for the death of his mother?

Jar-Jar Binks will reappear?

Jar-Jar Binks  won't   reappear?

The character of Boba Fett is introduced in this episode? 

The  main  emphasis  of the story will be the  romance  between  Anakin 
Skywalker,  and Queen 'scare-hair' Amidala,  set against a war going on 
in the background?

A  new  and  softer  side to Queen  "modelled  her  voice  on  Margaret 
Thatcher,  only  more dead and robotic" is revealed this time,  she was 
playing a rather cold character in Phantom Menace, according to Natalie 
Portman, the actress playing her?

There  are more,  but these are the ones that stick out.  Some of these 
rumours  have allegedly originated from sources close to George  Lucas, 
so  that  means  they must be true?  The rest of it,  is mere  internet 
psychobabble, the swines! Plug your ears now!


                  CiH Virus, yeah! and just whose army?  
 
 The creator of the CiH virus has an identity, and it isn't the slightly 
over-large  editor of Maggie writing this right now.  The real  naughty 
person,  one  Chen Ing-hau is taking a break from wreaking havoc on the 
hard drives and Bios of hundreds of thousands of PCs worldwide.

It  is not through his choice however,  as a loyal citizen,  Ing-hau is 
serving his compulsory military service in the Taiwanese army!

Whilst we are on the subject, just look how ( C) hen ( I )ng ( H )au gets his 
pseudonym.  Just like ( C )hris ( i )an ( H )olland!  Mine has the middle bit 
uncapitalised though - 'CiH', not 'CIH'!


                       Pass the Sick Bag, Malice!
 
We can't really expect to stay away from the subject of Bill Gates  and 
the  endlessly amusing things he says and does for very long.  True  to 
form,  it  is  just  a couple of minutes in,  and he's given  us  ample 
subject matter for a swiftly administered 'Dirking'!

With the reopening of the US Government trial (findings to be announced 
later  this year) Bill is unhappy.  He complains that the US Government 
has  turned  the  case  into a "Show trial with  the  primary  goal  of 
embarrassing us every day."

So he's not content to let Windows do it for him anymore?

In a related episode,  Bill Gates has woken up to the fact that not all 
the rest of world unreservedly love and worship Microsoft.  Some unkind 
people  even  think  that this is an organisation  which  is  grasping, 
monopolistic,  arrogant  and overly sure of itself.  A senior executive 
drafted  a  fresh set of "image attributes" to present a  cuddlier  and 
kinder Microsoft. These were promptly 'leaked'!

Make  sure you've totally cleared out your digestive tract (both  ends) 
before  reading on....   Needless to say,  the bits that look like this, 
*didn't* come from anywhere near Redwood GHQ.
 
"Microsoft cares about making a difference in my community."
 - So did Al Capone.
 
"Its charitable giving improves the lives of many people."
 - Would we be talking about the shareholders by chance?  

"Microsoft is honest."
 - Microsoft has amazing powers of self-delusion. 

"Microsoft is a leader in good corporate citizenship."
 - A carrion crow is a leader in good corpse picking.  

"Microsoft is a company I trust."
 - And I'm totally happy with an O/S that turns round and bites parts of    
  itself in the arse!
 
"Microsoft is a generous and supportive corporate citizen."
-  Yep, like anyone else would be at the point of a gun! 

Thanks  Bill,  life was just getting a bit samey and predictable around 
here, now you've made us all laugh again!


                (Not very nice tasting) Food for Thought?
 
Number  of people on Atari website 'Place to Be' campaigning for a  new 
version of Crystal Atari Browser (CAB) - 88.  (The single 'most wanted' 
item on their list according to the peoples choice, by the way.)

Reported number of hits on the author of CABs, own web pages (Alexander 
Clauss) relating to the forthcoming Apple Mac version 'iCab' - 50,000!

And you wonder why development of Atari CAB has been proceeding  slowly 
these days!?


                         ST Apex airbrushed out?
 
News of a fascinating 'lost' software title which makes you wonder what 
could have happened if it had ever been.

Apparently, and you can treat this as old diskmag editors gossip if you 
wish, Titan Designs back when Apex Media was being made was considering 
going a step further.

They were actively considering an ST version of Apex Media! This was to 
have had a very similar interface to the Falcon version. We are unaware 
if all the options such as the morphing studio would have been possible 
to  convert  to  the ST,  but we understand that  the  enhanced  screen 
displays  made  possible by Photochrome (19200 colours or more,  on  an 
unmodified STe) would have been used in this production?

There may even have been an early beta produced, showing the interface, 
if not any of the more advanced functions planned for it?

We would be very grateful for any more information relating to this. If 
it did go ahead,  it would have surely been a world-beating package for 
the ST.


                         '98 a little bit late?

 News  reaches  me  that the 'Union Demo '98,  a PC revival of  that  ST 
'old scene 'classic, has not gone away and died after all.

The  author has been "a bit busy with other projects",  but we are told 
to "expect a revival of interest real soon!"

There may even be an update to their web pages soon?

Looks  like a rename may be necessary as well,  as the '98 part of  the 
title has been missed by a 'Windows' margin!


                          Hold the Front Page!

 This  one really did make the front page!  All you people with  Hotmail 
accounts had better watch out!

 'Hackers in Biggest Internet Security Breach'

 "Microsoft  pulled the plug on its Hotmail service yesterday after  one 
of the biggest security breaches in internet history allowed hackers to 
read the private emails of more than 50 million subscribers" 

The Guardian - 31.8.99

The  bypass details to beat the Hotmail security may date back to  June 
1998?  Microsoft  were forced to close down the Hotmail services  after 
these  details  were  made more public,  and were  posted  around  more 
intensively.  According  to some internet analysts,  almost nothing had 
been  done to protect Hotmail users passwords and IDs,  the  assumption 
being  that no-one was going to try to break in!  People armed with the 
knowledge  to bypass their security may well have been breaking in  for 
some time before?

This  did go as far as affecting Microsoft shares,  which fell slightly 
on the New York stock exchange that day.


                    Tacky Races, or Less can be More!

 The other day, I was looking at two very similar actions that seemed to 
drag  on  for an age on two different computers.  Opening  a  directory 
where there were a large bunch of files took a while on a 16 mhz Falcon 
fitted  with  Jinnee desktop,  and it also seemed to drag for  a  whale 
holding its breath styled pause, on my 200 mhz Pentium work beast.

You might be surprised that I, a dedicated PC wintel PC loather, spends 
the  greater  part of the working day on one.  Necessary evil,  they're 
sort  of  very common in business,  but at least I get some  first-hand 
knowledge of the 'enemy' and its funny little ways!

Okay, fit the following...

200  mhz Pentium 2 PC,  bog-standard graphics card,  no fancy hardware, 
Windows 95. To open a new directory containing 44 files, 7 seconds.

16 mhz 68030 Falcon, no graphics card, MagiC O/S and Jinnee Desktop. To 
open a new directory containing 196 files, 6-7 seconds!

To throw a further interesting light onto this,  with a 50 mhz Centurbo 
2, the response with Jinnee/MagiC is reduced to 1-2 seconds. An upgrade 
to 600 mhz would give the PC comparable performance!

People  who  say that a good graphics card would help the  PC's  cause, 
are I think, missing the point somewhat!


                Stuff Nostradamus, THIS is the real deal!
                                  (or) 
                       Party like it's Space 1999?

 September 13th 1999,

Just a date, you think, but not just any old date. For those of you who 
ever  watched the oldie Gerry Anderson 'live actors trying  to  replace 
puppets'  70's  sci-fi series 'Space 1999',  today is the day that  the 
Moon gets blown out of orbit!

Damn inconsiderate,  putting a nuclear waste dump on the same planetary 
body  as  Moonbase Alpha!  Greenpeace would be  so   annoyed,  but it  is 
unlikely  they  managed to fit the Rainbow Warrior with even a  set  of 
rudimentary solid rocket boosters, let alone a hyperdrive?

Maybe it isn't going to happen  quite   like that,  but I'd check the sky 
at night tonight, if I were you!


                           Lost in Hyperspace?

 Fans  of  mega-trading Space epic 'Elite',  and its  sequel  'Frontier' 
might be interested in the following spat between the co-creators,  Ian 
'The  hippy  one' Bell,  and David 'Let's keep pushing  those  sequels' 
Braben.  We let the invaluable NTK News,  a service which we would like 
to  distil  and bottle the concentrated sarcasm from,  take up the  sad 
story.

 Meanwhile,  in  the good old Elite universe,  it looks like the trading 
between the systems of BELL (Anarchist, some trade in medicinal plants) 
and  BRABEN (Feudal Capitalist,  major export:  buggy releases of Elite 
sequels)  has  broken down completely.  At the alt.fan.elite  HQ,  just 
outside Lave, co-creator David Braben has denied that he idly shot down
Ian Bell's CIX Web site when he thought no-one was looking.
         
On the contrary, he says, he was on a special mission to *help* Bell by 
inquiring  whether  Bell still held his half of Elite's  copyright.  He 
innocently  asked Cix whether Bell really did have the legal  right  to 
offer binaries of the old game on his site,  and - booom - suddenly the 
ISP was sending in the Vipers.  Nothing to do with him,  honest. So why 
didn't Braben contact Bell directly, instead of via Cix?
         
Braben reports that Bell could not be reached - he doesn't reply to  e-
mail  hails,  apparently,  and  is  currently  living in some  sort  of 
unnavigable Witchspace where normal contact is impossible.  Odd,  given 
that  it  took us less than two minutes (via Cix's  own  "show  resume" 
feature) to get Ian's phone number and ask him ourselves. 

Nope,  Bell said, Braben had never e-mailed him about this. And  no, as 
far  as  he knew,  no  personal approaches have ever   been  made.  The 
first  he   knew   about   the  matter  was   when    "incoming   legal 
missile" sirens  started  wailing.  So,  who's the fugitive,  and who's 
the honest  trader?  Or  have they - as it seems to  the  wailing Elite 
fanboys - all been replaced by Thargoid agents?

                   Jilted again! Amiga scraps PC plan 

This lot is self-explanatory really, so I won't even try to. 

 By John G. Spooner, ZDNet News  
 
Users  of  the Amiga PC -- the computer industry's  equivalent  of  the 
perennially  disappointed Chicago Cubs fans -- have again  seen  defeat 
snatched  from  the  jaws of victory.  Amiga,  a unit of  Gateway  Inc. 
(NYSE:GTW),  notified  its  customers via a murky announcement  on  the 
Amiga Web site that it is changing its strategy yet again, and will not 
bring to market a much-anticipated multimedia computer. 

The  company  said it wants to focus on licensing the  Amiga  operating 
system software to makers of Internet appliances and other devices. The 
multimedia computer concept could live on if a hardware partner decided 
to make the machine abandoned by Amiga.  Amiga's loyal enthusiasts were 
quick   to   comment  --  posting  retorts  on   newsgroups   such   as 
comp.sys.amiga.advocacy and comp.sys.amiga.misc. 'Like a Zombie' "Amiga 
is  like a Zombie," said one poster in response.  "Commodore killed it, 
Escom killed it ... and Gateway killed it. Still, it shambles on." 
 
Well they got the 'shambling' bit spot on!


               Things to do to pass the time in September

 This  is a sort of follow-up to the kind of thing that Steve  'Insanity 
on toast' Moore used to do. Whatever comes into my head first.

Anxious students wanting to 'out' members of academia who may have been 
members  of the East German secret service (STASI).  Why not go to  the 
freshers fancy dress ball and dress up as a graffiti-stained section of 
the  Berlin  Wall.  Watch for their reactions,  and if those sad commie 
fanboys  blub  at  past  times  fondly  remembered  in  the  shadow  of 
Checkpoint Charlie, then ring MI5 at once!

Why  not  get the well-known Sinophile,  and totalitarian  regime  with 
extensive  business interests fan,  Rupert Murdoch to swap places for a 
while.  We  would  suggest  he swapped places with one of  those  lucky 
people  asked to work off their love of freedom of speech in a  Chinese 
prison sweatshop.  We would suggest that the swap takes its time, maybe 
a decade or more!

New  Beat  tips,  why not spend some of the time updating the 'work  in 
progress'  chart on 'Willies Adventures',  actually doing stuff for the 
game!  (Okay,  it's  as  not as if we're innocent of that sort of thing 
either.  I've  done a nice elaborate 'synopsis' or running order  chart 
for Maggie 28,  when we could be doing more articles in that time. This 
synopsis will have a maximum audience of two people!)


                        Six Billion Numbered Man?

 At some point in early to mid-October,  the baby will be born that will 
bring the current global human population up to six billion.

A few thoughts occur to me.

If Bill Gates donated his entire personal fortune,  he would just about 
be paying a dollar to everybody, but the cost of postage would probably 
swallow most of that up?

For all the efforts of people such as Hitler,  Stalin,  Pol Pot,  Kenny 
out of South Park,  etc,  to try to make a dent in the human population 
over  the  past century,  isn't it really funny there are  more  people 
around than ever!

So  it would seem that reproduction defeats termination - repeat  after 
me, SEX BEATS DEATH!

Sex is loads more fun than death anyway,  although you shouldn't try to 
mix  the two together 'in excess',  like that unfortunate Mr  Hutchence 
allegedly did!

That's enough!


                             Judgement Day!!
 
Some big news now...

The  US  anti-trust trial against Microsoft has resulted  in  a  ruling 
against Bill Gates's rather 'forward' way of doing business!

            *Pause for sublime moment of sheer happiness!* 

It  all  isn't over yet,  as Bill will appeal (but to  whom?)  However, 
visions of Microsoft being broken up (into firewood?) or having Windows 
made  more 'open source' dance across our screens.  

Now you all know our feelings vis Microsoft, 'Monopolysoft'. We needn't 
really say any more.

But the rest of the press had their day....

 New York Times ... "A Federal judge has made it official: Microsoft is a 
monopoly,   a  two-ton  bully  that  squashes  competition  and  cheats 
consumers."

 The  Liberation  (France)...  "Bill Gates is false and arrogant.  He has 
swapped his sweat-shirt for a waist coat. His glory days are over."

The   Financial  Times  masterly understated that "Monopolies  are  never 
really  benign."  Going  on to  add  "Microsoft  stifled  technological 
development,  and  blocked  other firms from making investment  in  new 
businesses."

The  last,  and best word really has to go to the Silicon Valley  based 
 San  Jose  Mercury  News ,  querying the point of  the  whole  exercise, 
commenting,  "It  took an army of expensive lawyers and spinmeisters to 
find out what was plain as day: Microsoft does hold a monopoly".

Goodnight!

 
                      Still Lost in Hyperspace!! 
                        (the thargoids attack!)
 
Back with that NTK reported row between the original co-creators of the 
Space  Trading 8-bit classic 'Elite'.  This one just won't lie down and 
go away. Read on.
 
                          ongoing feuds

Right on, Commander! The ongoing dog-fight between Elite co-
authors BRABEN and BELL moved to "Dangerous" rating this week: 
fugitive Bell, whose previous Web site releases of the 
Elite binaries had been nuked from orbit by Frontier
wildsman Braben's military-grade laser, has fought back with
a full source release of the original BBC Micro version: all
20KB of glorious retro myth. The site's just a pile of
interplanetary scrap metal now, presumably due to the return
of Braben's legal Vipers, but not before hundreds of fans
had snatched the illegal goods, and Ctrl-H'd out into
untraceable hyperspace. Will Braben turn against his fans?
      
Will the rebels of the Reverse-Engineered Elite Source
Project receive an unexpected fillup? Keep watching the
monochrome starfield, traders!

   http://home.clara.net/cjpinder/elite.html
   - longest cheat sheet ever

   http://www.deja.com/threadmsg_ct.xp?AN=552921070         
   - Braben decloaking! Red Alert! Aiieeeee!

   http://www.bigfoot.com/~elite0/
   - site of ex-Bell pages. God, I love writing these stories

 And we love grabbing them to stick in our own publication!

Update:-  In a further amazing twist,  it seems that David Braben,  the 
copyright protecting member of this fragmented duo,  has relented,  and 
that  'Elite' is regarded as in the public domain.  Ian Bell's  website 
has been reinstated, and the game images for all the different versions 
of that classic game are available once more!

It  still  seems  that the two aren't the best of  buddies  though,  as 
poking  around on Ian Bells website revealed an attempt by  Braben,  to 
sue  him  for libel from an interview that Ian gave!

Seems to me,  if you're that much of a genius,  some other bits of your 
brain  go walkabout to compensate.  Errm,  the bits that stop you going 
anally retentive, perhaps?


                      The (very) long term Outlook?
 
I'm not quite sure how much of this to believe,  but it is a good story 
anyway.

Someone, with too much time on their hands, or not enough to do at work 
has  had  a rummage through the calender/appointments  section  of  the 
popular (among the PeeCee fraternity) internet mailer program Microsoft 
Outlook. 

Apparently,  they  found that it goes up all the way to the year  4500! 
(October the 5th, I seem to remember?)

Does  Bill  Gates  know something about cryogenic  storage  and  future 
revival techniques that we don't? Alternatively, is it some mad bid for 
immortality where he downloads his consciousness into a vast electronic 
brain.
 
"F*ck the US Supreme Court, I will out-evolve them  over time, and win! 
My  cockroach  friends will still need Microsoft,  when their  time  to 
dominate life on Earth comes around!"
 
I  don't  think  that would work too well  though.  The  modern  cyber-
equivalent of 'spoiling the ship for a hap'worth of tar' would  cruelly 
come into force if he tried that? 

 "It  hurts,  Windows  is  in  my  head,  it's too  big,  get  it  out!! 
Noooooaaaggh!"
 
Which leaves a final thought. It makes poor old Adolf Hitler look a bit 
of an unambitious sluggard with his piffling 'Thousand year Reich!'


                          Fantasy ZX Spectrum?

 It seems to merely  emulate  a famous old computer isn't enough for  some 
people?  Here's  an interesting report from a Speccy equivalent to  our 
own Atari DHS 'Scene News' Take it away boys!                          
                 
                      ŒNEW  SPECTRUM EMULATOR 

There  is   ANOTHER   new  Spectrum   emulator released,  but  with   a  
difference  -  this one gives the Spectrum  256  colours!  And no, it's 
not a phasing / paging trick like has been seen on the 128's.

The  emulator,  written  by  Inigo  Ayo  and David  Goti  emulates  not  
one   but   TWO  processors  -  the standard   Z80   processor,  and  a 
ficticious processor called Z80_GFX.

This  processor uses it's own memory region in which each  position  is  
64  bits  wide.  This allows the new processor to move data and operate 
with  them  so  it  can  display the  results  in  256   colours.   The  
only drawback is that  before  a  game  can  be played in 256  colours, 
it must  have  it's colour  palette  edited  beforehand.   But,  eleven 
games  have been  converted  so  far (mostly Dinamic and Hewson  and  a 
couple of Ultimate titles) and  the  results  really are amazing!

Besides  this  remarkable  function,   the program emulates a  standard 
48k   Spectrum, offers  joystick  control  and  48k  sound through  the 
PC  speaker.  There  is  also  a very  thorough  debugger  and  Z80   /  
SNA snapshot format support.

 So  there  you have it ,   proof that anything is possible if you  really 
want it to happen! Also, how soon before we start getting emulated ST's 
with 'fantasy' extra features not put on the original? I'm sure there's 
some emulator coder out there thinking, "If only....?"
 
 
                            Zilog a Go-Go!
 
Also cribbed from the same news-pages which gave us the story above, an 
interesting  piece about a chip manufacturer who once held most of  the 
8-bit personal computer market in its hands, before Intel waded in.

Hardware designers,  bored with the present bland Intel consensus (with 
a  fleeting promise of new PPC and RISC designs?) Well why not  take  a 
look at this!
 
Zilog   have  manufactured  a   completely   new processor.   The  eZ80  
executes     code   four     times   faster   than   the    traditional 
processor and can even operate upto 80Mhz,   while that may not be fast 
for  a  PC,   that is some TWENTY TWO times faster  than   the original 
Spectrum! 

The processor can  also address 16 Megabytes, as  opposed  to  the 64Kb  
of   the   Z80A.   The  new  chip  also carries a  new   multiplication  
engine  and TCP/IP  stack  (a  requirement   for   the internet).  

Zilog   have   only  released  a small amount of data on the  chip   at  
this time  (25th  September)  which  is  later   in  this  issue,  it's 
unknown  whether  the   chip could  be  used  in  a  Spectrum   without  
heavy modification to the PCB.
 

                         And I still hate PC's!
 
I think we're finally getting to the point where a single statement can 
sum up the difference between Atari and the rest, and Wintel PC's.

The internet is getting into all kinds of places now.  My parent's home 
is  now one of those.  Guess who was given the job of getting the whole 
damn ensemble going?

Yeah,  that's right. Still, it proved easier than I expected it to, the 
manufacturers,  NEC, making a geniune attempt to produce something that 
worked  first  time off,  'out of the box'.  (That was nearly a product 
endorsement, wasn't it?)

Mother (non-technophobic end of family) chooses a provider, and decides 
on Compuserve (expensive, but solid). These are okay, until the fateful 
day,  where a mail from their support people arrives saying,  "Get your 
Compuserve  2000  software  NOW!  The current set-up will be  dead  and 
buried by the end of January."

What  you  are  lumbered with,  is effectively a compulsory  50  minute 
download session, which Compuserve kindly don't charge you for, but the 
phone company does, of course!

Thanks, Compuserve...
 
Not  to mention that if one little thing goes wrong with the  download, 
it's  'start again-ville',  and we all know how reliable the net can be 
at  the wrong times of day with slow and broken connections.  (About as 
safe  a  procedure as dancing with your tits out,  over a  fairly  tall 
barbed wire fence! for women and very fat blokes, that is.)
 
So, coming back to my point at the very beginning:-

With Atari,  you upgrade when YOU are ready, but with PC's, you upgrade 
when THEY tell you to!

That is why I hate PC's. Very simple really.

 CiH, all the way up to December '99
