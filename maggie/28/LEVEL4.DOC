Primary mission    :  Steal an I.D. card to open the reactor
                      security doors in the next stage.

Secondary mission  :  As Ripley didn't finish her alien killing
                      mission the last time, you have to shoot
                      down the alien brood.

On  starting this level the first thing you should do is  turn  around. 
You'll  see  a  terminal on your right hand side and  some  R2D2  style 
robots patrolling the corridor.  This is a perimeter corridor,  you can 
walk all the way around it and finish up where you started from.

Turn  left into a corridor and kill what looks like a  teenager,  (I'll 
call  them  hippies from now on),  pick up the ammo.  You are now in  a 
large room that has 3 other corridors and a tall central structure with 
a lift platform, enter the room.

Turn right into a split corridor,  kill a technician and a hippy on the 
right and a hippy on the left.  Pick up the ammo, shield and medikit in 
the left hand corridor and continue round and kill another hippy,  pick 
up  some more ammo.  Go back down the corridor into the large room  and 
and go right into a small corridor with a door at the end, kill a hippy 
and pick up the medikit.
 
Back  into  the large room again,  and go right into another  corridor, 
kill a couple of old looking nightwatchmen who look a bit like corporal 
Jones out of Dad's Army. Continue along the corridor, kill a technician 
and pick up the ammo. Turn round and go back into the large room.

Go the the central area with columns,  pick up the ammo and shield. Use 
the lift platform to go up. There is a map on the left and a medikit on 
the right,  get these.  Go into the split corridor again, but this time 
go  right,  pick  up  the ammo.  You'll see a staircase that  is  being 
patrolled by a hippy and nightwatchman. Climb the stairs keeping to the 
left,  killing them as you go up,  pick up the shield at the top.  Do a 
running jump at the top and pick up the ammo on the right on the  other 
ledge.

You are now in a small room with ledges. Kill the nightwatchman and the 
technician,  pick  up the ultra scanner on the left.  Do a running jump 
over to where the nightwatchman is,  pick up the ammo and medikit.  Now 
jump onto the ledge where the technician is and flick the switch.  This 
switch opens a door in the perimeter corridor.

Drop off of the ledge and kill another technician, pick up the ammo. Go 
along the corridor and turn left into the perimeter corridor, go right. 
You'll pass a doorway on the left with moving walls,  continue along to 
the  next  doorway  on  the  left and  turn  left.  Kill  a  hippy  and 
technician, save the game at the terminal.

Enter  the corridor with yellow 'V' shapes on the wall,  turn left  and 
kill  a  technician and pick up the ammo,  continue down this  corridor 
killing the nightwatchmen and picking up the ammo as you go. At the end 
of  the  corridor is a switch,  flick the switch to open a door at  the 
other end of the corridor,  run back down the corridor through the door 
and take a corridor on the left by the swich.

Kill  a nightwatchman and pick up the ammo and shield,  continue  along 
the  corridor  killing  technicians,  pick up the  ammo,  medikits  and 
shield.  Continue  down the main corridor ignoring the small one on the 
 right, going through the wall at the end into a secret area.

Kill  another  technician and continue along the  corridor  going  left 
around  a  bend,  kill the nightwatchman and pick up the ammo  and  the 
invisibility  (this  comes in handy later).  There is a  grating  here, 
we'll be on the other side of that in a few minutes. Turn around and go 
back  down the corridor the way you came.  You'll notice that the floor 
of  the corridor will change from grey to black on a straight  section. 
Press  the  spacebar  when you are on this black section to  get  to  a 
secret area with lots of medikits, ammo and shields.

Go  back up the corridor to the end and turn left.  Continue along this 
corridor killing technicians and picking up ammo,  and a medikit. There 
is a small alcove on the left with a shield in it, get this. Follow the 
corridor around a sharp left hand bend, kill the hippies waiting there. 
On a ledge behind you is a jetpack, jump up and get it.

Pick up the ammo and a shield in a corridor on the left,  continue down 
the corridor with the black floor. You'll find yourself on a ledge with 
a room below,  on the right is the grating you saw earlier. Drop of the 
ledge into the lower room and kill the 2 technicians. Pick up the ammo, 
medikit,  blue key and shield. Now make your way out of the room, using 
the lift platform, go along the corridor until you get to the switch on 
the  left.  Flick  the  switch to open the door,  save the game at  the 
terminal on the wall where you came in.

Turn right into the perimeter corridor and make your way to the doorway 
with  the sliding walls.  Kill the technician patrolling the left  hand 
corridor.  It's  very important to get the timing right to get  through 
the sliding doors... try running through just after both doors meet. If 
you make it through turn right and kill another technician, pick up the 
shield  and the medikit from the right hand corridor,  go down the left 
hand corridor, pick up the ammo as you go.

You  are  now  in a large room with a ledge running  around  it  and  a 
structure  in the center.  Kill the technician in front of you and  the 
one to the right,  pick up the ammo.  Drop down off of the ledge to the 
 ground below,  kill all the hippies and technicians that you see,  pick 
up the ammo, medikits and shield. Save the game at the terminal.

South east corner of the room? ... hmmm

Walk  into  the  corner of the central structure to the  right  of  the 
terminal, you'll find a lift platform. Go up, pick up the ammo, shield, 
medikits and monster detector,  now use the transporter pad.  You'll be 
transported  back up to the ledge,  go left along the ledge to the end. 
Do  a running jump across the gap into a corridor,  kill the technician 
and pick up the ammo.

Open  the  door  at the end of the corridor,   kill the hippy  and  the 
technician  as  you enter a small room,  in an alcove on the left is  a 
nightviewer.  Enter  the  corridor  on the right,  kill the  hippy  and 
technician,  continue  along  the  corridor until you come to  a  ledge 
overlooking  a room.  Kill the 2 technicians on the ledge,  pick up the 
ammo  and medikit.  Below is a room containing a couple of  transporter 
pads,  drop  down  into the room,  kill the technician and a couple  of 
hippies,  pick  up the ammo and shield,  use the transporter pad on the 
right.

Go  down  the corridor from the transporter pads and kill a  couple  of 
technicians,  one on a ledge on the left and one in the corridor with a 
central  partition  on  the right,  pick up the ammo.  Go left  down  a 
corridor  and  kill a couple of hippies and a technician,  pick up  the 
ammo,  medikit  and shield.  Drop off a ledge and up round some stairs, 
kill a technician,  jump across the gap and pick up the ammo,  continue 
along  the  corridor to the end.  Go through the wall at the  end  (use 
spacebar).

Turn  right through the doorway and kill a hippy on the left,  pick  up 
the ammo. You are now overlooking a lower room with small pillars. Do a 
running  jump onto o ne of the pillars.  Kill a hippy on a ledge to the 
left.  Drop  down  a kill another hippy,  pick up the ammo,  medikit and 
shield. Get back onto a pillar and jump across to the ledge, flick t he 
switch.  This  switch opens a door at the far end of the corridor  with 
 the partition.

Jumping  back up out of the lower room can be tricky,  you have to jump 
from  the  ledge and not from the pillars.  Make your way back  to  the 
corridor with the partition,  it's by the transporter pads.  Go through 
the  doorway  at the end and turn right,  kill the hippy.  Pick up  the 
ultra scanner in an alcove on the left and the ammo.

Jump  out of the window into the large room below,  shoot the automatic 
gun  that  is infront of you until it explodes.  Go down  the  corridor 
leading  off  from the room,  pick up the gasmask.  Continue along  the 
corridor,  kill a hippy and a couple of technicians, go left at the top 
of  the  stairs  and pick up some ammo and medikits.  Turn  around  and 
pickup the shotgun ammo, use the spacebar to open a hidden door.

Go  left along the corridor,  kill a couple of hippies and pick up  the 
ammo,  continue  along to the end.  You are about to enter a large room 
with invisible technicians patrolling it. Turn on your invisibility and 
enter  the  room.  Go  left when you enter the room and  you'll  see  a 
staircase.  Pick up the medikit and go up the stairs. Kill a technician 
as  you  go  up.  Do  a  running  jump  across  the  gap.  Kill  the  4 
nightwatchmen on the other side.  You'll be able to shoot the invisible 
technician from up here quite easily, they only need 1 shot and they're 
dead.

Flick  the switch at the end to open the door,  go through,  follow the 
corridor round.  You'll enter a room with a couple of automatic guns on 
the ceiling.  Shoot at them until they explode. Go right when you enter 
the room, pick up the shield. Go the the end of the ledge and jump down 
into a lower corridor.  Go left at the end and continue along, kill the 
hippies and technicians, pick up the ammo and medikit, save the game at 
the terminal on the wall.

Take a drink at the bar !!??

Drop  off  the ledge into a lower corridor,  pick up the  shields.  Now 
enter the bar,  killing the hippies as you go. Pick up the medikit,ammo 
 and green key.  There is another hippy on a higher ledge at the back of 
the room,  go up the stairs and kill him,  pick up the ammo.  Have a go 
with the Dukebox...hehehe.

Exit the bar, use the lift platform in the corridor to get out. Go left 
back along the corridor until you come to a room on the left that has 3 
nightwatchmen  in  it.  Kill  them all,  pick up the ammo,  medikit and 
shield.  On the wall of this room is a rotary switch, press it 5 times. 
It  opens  a door at the far end of the corridor,  go left out  of  the 
room, kill a couple of hippies in a room on the right, pick up the ammo 
and medikit. Continue along the corridor and go through the door.

Someone's just turned the lights out,  so use the nightviewer. Kill the 
technician on the right and pick up the ammo, back up and go left, kill 
another technician in a doorway on the right. Drop off the ledge into a 
lower  room,  go  out the doorway and turn right,  flick the switch and 
pick up the medikit.  Use a lift platform to go back up, turn left into 
another corridor. Pick up the ammo, go right and drop down a ledge.

Turn left and kill a technician, go to the end and turn right, kill the 
hippy  at the end and go left.  Go right into a corridor and follow  it 
round.  Go right at the end and pick up the ultra scanner,  go left and 
pick up the ammo, left again and then right into another corridor. Turn 
on your invisibility as you'll need it,  Kill a technician guarding the 
stairs,  pick  up  the ammo.  Enter the room with automatic guns and go 
left into a doorway,  turn around and shoot at the automatic guns until 
they explode, turn off the invisibility now as you'll need it later.

Pick up the shield in this small room and flick a switch,  this opens a 
door  on the other side of the room that had the automatic guns in.  Go 
into  this  other room.  Pick up the ID card,  you've now completed the 
primary  mission.  Pick  up the medikit and ammo,  to the right of  the 
switch  is a small hidden area that contains some more invisibilty,  go 
in and get it. Flick the switch to get out of this room.

Go  back down the corridor then left,right,left.  You'll enter  another 
room  with  a central divide.  Go left killing a  technician,  continue 
 along down a corridor with brown striped walls. Kill 2 more technicians 
and pick up the ammo. Flick the switch and go through the door, pick up 
a  shield in an alcove on the left,  go left and down a corridor.  Kill 
the technician at the end,  pick up the medikit, go left up the stairs, 
get  another medikit.  Kill a hippy and a technician,  pick up the ammo 
and shield.  Go into another corridor and save the game at the terminal 
on the right.

Open  the door on the left and continue along this corridor  until  you 
get back to the large room that had the first automatic gun in it.  Use 
the lift platform and go up,  do a jump to get back through the window, 
go  down the corridor with the partition to where the transporter  pads 
are. Use the left hand transporter pad.

You  now find yourself transported to a new area.  Turn left from where 
you  transported in and do a couple of jumps to get up to  the  highest 
level.  Kill  the technician that is patrolling this high platform.  At 
the back of the platform is a room lower down,  it contains ammo,  drop 
down and get the ammo,  and jump out again.  Drop off of the high ledge 
and  go to the center of the room and pick up the geiger counter,  then 
save the game at the terminal on the wall.

Go  up  the  stairs between the columns and head down  the  red  walled 
corridor.  Press  the  spacebar  to  lift the wall  blocking  the  way. 
Continue  down  the corridor,  pick up the shield.  Turn right,  kill a 
technician  and a hippy and continue along the corridor,  don't go down 
the left hand corridor.  Kill a couple of technicians at the end of the 
corridor, pick up the ammo, shield and medikit.

Use the lift platform to go up, go down the first corridor on the left, 
turn  your invisibility on now.  You'll enter a large room with columns 
and  a  ledge  at  the back on which there is  a  technician  and  some 
nightwatchmen.  Go down the right hand side of the room until you reach 
a  switch,   flick  the  switch  and  exit  the  room,   turn  of  your 
invisibility.

You'll find that a door has opened in the second corridor, go down this 
 corridor,  kill the technician and pick up the ammo. At the end of this 
corridor  is a large room,  go up the stairs on the left and run  along 
the  raised platform killing the technicians and picking up  the  ammo. 
Drop  off  of the ledge and press the spacebar,  the whole  floor  will 
lower revealing a hidden corridor in the left hand corner.  Go down the 
corridor, pick up the ammo and onto the transporter pad

You've  now  been  transported into the room  that  has  the  secondary 
mission  in.  Drop off of the ledge and pick up your new weapon...  the 
most powerful one...  the flame thrower!!!  Kill the 2 demons that have 
somehow escaped from the DOOM (tm) dungeons. Pick up the ammo, now kill 
all of the alien eggs that you see,  you've now completed the secondary 
mission.  Jump up onto the ledge on the left and walk along,  drop down 
between  the thin walls that are seperating the room into two.  Use the 
lift platform to go up, get the radiation suit on the right and the red 
key  on  the left,  go onto the high ledge and pick up the  shield  and 
medikits.  Drop  off  of  the  ledge and kill 3 more  demons  that  are 
guarding the transporter pads.

Phew...  I  think  that's  enough help for now,  you've completed  both 
missions  and have only to find the yellow key.  You need it to get  to 
the exit.  One last hint,  when you're going for the yellow key use the 
radiation  suit,  it  might  save  your  life.  Have  fun  on  the  USS 
Enterprise...  you'll  know  what I mean when you find it.  As  before, 
there  are still loads of places that have been missed out,  you'll see 
how many when you find the full map near the exit.

Hurry up and finish this level as the last one is even more fun.
