The Sixth Sense, we are told, was "a surprise hit" in America. 

It's a surprise it was a hit because  it is not a big budget explosion 
fest, its not a romantic comedy, its  got  Bruce Willis in it but it's 
not an action film. 

It's a surprise it was a hit, because it's shit.

This ominous warning was imparted to me by a friend. 
"Do not go and see the  sixth  sense.  It  is  the worst film ever. If 
anyone asks you to go and  see  this  film, refuse. Do anything to get 
out of it - even fake your own death."

Foolishly laughing at this over this  over  the top warning, I went to 
see the picture. I would later learn the value of heeding advice.

Bruce  Willis  is  a  child  psychologist.  The  film  begins  with  a 
disgruntled former patient breaking  into  his  apartment and shooting 
him. You can't kill your character in  the opening scene! But then you 
remember, this is a film about ghosts.

The 'action' then moves forward a  year.  Bruce Willis is sitting on a 
bench, apparently alive and  well.  What's  happening  here? Wasn't he 
shot dead a year ago? He must be a ghost.

The film then follows Bruce's  interaction  with a disturbed child. He 
won't reveal his dark secret to  Uncle Bruce, although the audience is 
fully aware of it. The kid  can  see  dead people. Maybe that's why he 
 can see Willis.

After lots of tedious bloody ghosts  appear  to the kid, he eventually 
lets Willis into his secret. Willis  tells  the  brat to listen to the 
spirits as they may want to impart something important.

On a ghost's advice, Willis &  Brat  gatecrash  a funeral and unveil a 
poisonous mother.

Mission accomplished, Bruce leaves the  kid  and heads home. Now comes 
the twist. He realises that he is dead. Then the film ends. That's it.

This twist couldn't have been any  more  obvious if it was attached in 
20 foot letters an  articulated  lorry  driving  at  you at 100mph. It 
wasn't really even a twist  -  you  saw  Willis  die  at the start. It 
worked by assuming the audience had  the attentions span and memory of 
goldfish and would forget the first scene 3 seconds later.

You'd spent the entire  time  waiting  for  something  - anything - to 
happen, and nothing does.  It's  like  waiting  for  Godot, but with a 
vacuum sucking out your enjoyment at the same time.

So is there anything good about the Sixth Sense?

Not really.  The  little  kid  acts  quite  well,  in  a  teary  eyed, 
whispering, terrified sort of way,  but this rapidly becomes annoying. 
The camerawork and sets are pedestrian.  Its  not  scary - to be fair, 
its not really trying to be,  but  it  really needs another element to 
it.

If the Sixth Sense  deserves  any  awards,  they  are for the slowest, 
dullest and most pointless film of  the year. Bonus points awarded for 
getting people to sit down  and  sit  through  2 hours of rubbish. The 
metaphor about watching paint dry never seemed more apt.

The Sixth Sense? Nonsense, more like.
