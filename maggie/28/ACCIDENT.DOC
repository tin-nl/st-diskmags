                       Partyland 'A' Division
 
Subject:- Collision between the Vengabus, and the B52's "Chrysler that  
is as big as a whale".

Location of accident:- Dead Man's curve. 
 
Synopsis  of circumstances:- Collision between the two above  mentioned 
vehicles. According to witnesses, both vehicles approached the accident  
location  from opposing directions.  The Vengabus was seen to pull  out  
sharply  into the middle of the road,  giving the other vehicle no time  
at all to stop or take avoiding action.

 From survivors accounts from inside the Vengabus,it is thought that the 
driver  was distracted by the 'in-bus' video system  playing  continual 
tapes of girls in skimpy tops washing themselves very slowly.

Traumatised Vengabus survivors were found wandering around the accident 
scene,  constantly repeating to attending emergency services that "They  
liked to party."

There was concern expressed at the roadworthiness of the "Chrysler that  
is  big as a whale." Investigating officers were concerned that it  was 
"About to set  sail" in a nearby lake.  It was suggested that they were 
trying  to save  time and take a short cut to their final  destination, 
"The Love Shack."  by taking an over-water route.

If  this  mad  plan had been carried out,  the car  would  almost  have 
certainly sunk without a trace,  drowning all on board.  Perhaps,  in a  
perverse  way,  we have this RTA to thank for the fact that there  were  
any survivors from this vehicle at all?

In addition, the safety standards of this 1950's built car are woefully 
inadequate,  lacking modern refinements such as side impact bars,  ABS, 
airbags, and even basic items such as seat belts (which would have been  
of  little use in this situation as it was "seating twenty or more"  at 
the time of the accident.)

The   Vengabus  cannot  be  described  as  wholly  roadworthy   either. 
Particular  mention has to be made of its suspension which was "Up  and  
down,  and  up and down." This sharply reduced braking efficiency,  and  
was  a  major  contributory  factor to  the  severity  of  the  overall 
accident.

The lack of attention to detail extends to areas such as the fuel tanks 
and  the vehicle ignition system,  which failed to trip out on  impact, 
and may have led to the vehicle going "Boom Boom boom boom!" if a  fire 
had actually broken out.

The  final word on this tragedy comes from a police spokesman who  said 
"We searched all the survivors for drugs,  but found none,  so for some 
form of light relief,  we had to break into our own stash instead!"
