 
Long  after ancient video arcade games have been carted away from  your 
local  arcade and been quietly dumped or discarded after hardware  they 
run  on  becomes  senile  or they cease  to  be  profitable,  they  get 
reincarnated on today's PCs.

John  Hayward  fumbles  around  for  some  20ps  and  gives  his  first 
impressions on:

If you have been keeping up with the emulation scene you must of  heard 
of  Mame.   Mame  stands for Multi Arcade Machine Emulator and it  does 
exactly what its name suggests.


One coin one play 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Since seeing a lot of on line resources (as well as a lot of web sites, 
Mame  now has its own newsgroup and web chat page)  I become  more  and 
more intrigued to try it out.  As well as DOS and W95 versions, MAME is 
also  available  for  Win95/98/NT,  Macintosh,  UNIX,  OS/2,  BeOS  and 
rumoured to be for the Amiga too. (what no Atari?!?)

I've now been suckered into building a PC, a PII Celeron 266 with 32meg 
RAM, with a currently borrowed 1.7gig disk.

At the moment I only have Tempest,  Zaxxon,  Mr Do,  Gauntlet,  Pacman, 
Starwars,  Paperboy,  Marble  Madness  and Battlezone.   This will have 
grown very rapidly by the time you read this!

One  of the great things about Mame it emulates at hardware  level,  so 
games  that  use Z80,  6502,  6809 or 68000 processors and Yamaha sound 
chips  (like an ST!) or Pokey sound chips are emulated using  specially 
written portions of code for chip for extremely accurate emulation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Mame  (as  the the standard DOS version) can be fiddly to set  up.   as 
well  as  the  the Mame program zip file,  you need  a  program  called 
CSDPMI.EXE,  I  don't  know  what it is,  but its some kind  of  memory 
manager  and its essential to run this before running Mame.   You  will 
also need ROMs for each of your favourite games.  Basically someone has 
to  open  the  back  of a real games and nick the  ROM  chips  off  the 
motherboard  and read them into a PC,  so these are called ROM  images.  
You have a set of files for each game which is put into a directory.

I  prefer  to use the DOS version,  as emulation really needs  as  much 
speed  as  you  can  get  and  you  don't  have  conflicts  with  other 
applications.   To  use  the DOS version of Mame well,  it does help to 
know  how MS-DOS and batch files work to getting running  well.   There 
are  a lot of DOS command switches you can use with Mame.  It lets  you 
alter the screen resolution and sound card settings and other bits  and 
pieces,  so  writing a batch file for each game is good idea to get the 
best  results from each game.   There are some front end programs  that 
run  under  DOS  with Mame that makes it easy to turn on  your  PC  and 
selecting the game you want to play.

You  will come across certain games that won't work,  that have glitchy 
sound or runs too slow.  Adding '-frameskip 1' into a batch file I have 
found makes music and speech play better (especially Gauntlet, Paperboy 
and  Marble  Madness)  On Missile Command and Zaxxon  the  screen  will 
distort  and  flicker so you have to add '-noscanlines' to  make  these 
work. Some games do not work yet and you will just have to wait for the 
next update of Mame which seems to come out every month or so, as there 
is  a  large  team of programmers working  on  very  frequent  updates.  
Unfortunately  one  of  my  all time favourites  Hard  Drivin'  is  not 
supported yet, so I am eagerly waiting for a driver for this game to be 
written.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Strictly speaking you are not allowed to own ROM images unless you  own 
the real arcade game,  so the sites that have some or all of the 1,200+ 
games  supported  by Mame,  have to mention this to protect  themselves 
from  being  accused  of supplying pirates.   A few  people  have  been 
selling CDs full of ROMs but as this is not legal so if you want to buy 
these you'd better look in a Warez newsgroup.  The Mame team do mention 
the legal stuff about ROM images,  they make it clear that you download 
Mame,  and you are on your own to track down ROMs and not take the Mame 
team responsible, as if they were trying to encourage piracy the men in 
suits  from the arcade companies would do everything to end the  arcade 
emulation scene like what happened recently with the Ultra HLE Nintendo 
64 emulator.   Therefore don't email the authors with requests on where 
to find ROMs, use your imagination and a good search engine. :)


There  are some good web sites which have mentioned early  Atari  games 
like  Asteroids,  Tempest and Starwars that use Vector monitors  (Atari 
called  them  'XY'  monitors.)  These are  really  weird.   Traditional 
tellies  and computer monitor tubes use an image made out of dots,  the 
smaller the dots the nicer the graphics look,  right?   Vector monitors 
have  the picture built of straight lines,  in a similar fashion to  an 
oscilloscope.   Asteroids  was  released in 1979 and is the best  known 
example  of  vector  game.   The monochrome graphics are  made  out  of 
polygons  and the text and numbers are made of lines,  so you don't see 
'normal'  graphics  as such,  though there is no blockiness  or  jagged 
edges and you get a lovely clear picture.  Later games include Tempest, 
Battlezone  and  Starwars  which  have  colour  vector  screens.  Atari 
generally  pioneered  vector games,  but Sega did a few but  these  are 
relatively rare.  

The  Empire  strikes back which was the follow up to Starwars  was  the 
last ever vector game released around 1985. Operators (the folk who own 
the  games,  who  jointly  make the money with wherever the  games  are 
sited)  have found vector games to be unreliable and difficult  to  get 
spare parts, so sadly vector games are becoming increasing rarer.

The  controls for most games are fairly standard being arrow  keys  and 
Control and Alt keys for fire and jump or whatever.   Most arcade games 
have  built in diagnostic software activated by a switch hidden  inside 
the  unit,  and Mame lets you activate this via a pop up menu when  you 
press Tab which also lets you rededfine the keys and joystick settings.  
Standard PC analogue joysticks are supported (I hate them)


"Superzapper recharge" (Tempest) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Is that all there is to Mame?

Its  not the same playing great games on a keyboard on a  boring  beige 
14" screen is it??

No!!!

Some     enthusiasts    have    taken    one    step    further     and 
bought/obtained/blagged  a real dead/expired/stripped arcade  unit  and 
mounted  a PC inside wired up to the screen and controls and  lets  you 
play the games in a authentic looking unit.

Several  of the many conversions shown on the web have PCs  coupled  to 
large  screen in TVs,  or 19" VGA monitors (if you can afford it!)  for 
controls,  some  proper  arcade joysticks and buttons wired up to a  PC 
gamepad.   One  guy is playing Missile Command with a proper trackball, 
another  wanted a proper paddle controller for Tempest/Arkanoid  so  he 
modified  a PC mouse to do this!   One particularly good site showed  a 
British guy who obtained a empty cabinet and kitted it out himself with 
a  19"  colour TV coupled to a Pentium 200 with a  graphics  card  with 
suitable  output  connections,  and an amplifier with large car  stereo 
speakers to pump out the sound,  and the whole thing resprayed a orangy 
pink peachy colour the whole thing looked fantastic even though it cost 
him around œ1,000!!!!

If  I can locate a suitable cabinet this could be fun!!   Hmm,  time to 
visit the tip I think, although this will probably have to wait until I 
get my own flat.  :)

There's no doubt there is now a huge following for the arcade emulation 
scene.   When  Dave's Arcade page,  a popular web site went down due to 
request  from the ISP that hosted it,  100 different people offered  to 
provided  web space to host it!!!   I have also often noticed that some 
of  the sites that contain ROM images are freqently jammed with  number 
of users trying downloading games at once.

Its  been  huge fun for me,  considering my local arcades  on  Southsea 
seafront don't have any games older than 1993, although this week I was 
in  Ryde  on  the Isle of Wight and passing an  arcade,  and  they  had 
Asteroids,  Mr Do, Hard Drivin', Ms Pacman and few other old gems, they 
also  had  Starwars  but it was broken!  :(   I don't  like  all  games 
though,  I find beat em ups dull,  and I'm not really keen on light gun 
games.

I've learnt loads about how arcade games work through resources on  the 
net and there seems to be two types of arcades:  the type with loads of 
money  to spend on the latest modern games (which are boring) and  sell 
off the older games when they start to lose popularity,  and the arcade 
with  old games bought cheap from auctions and the games tend  to  have 
scruffy  looking  cabinets  and may have the wrong game  in  the  wrong 
cabinet.


High score:
