                             FUN Industries 
 
This  was  the second-placed Falcon demo competition entry,  only  just 
pipped  to  the  post  by Dead Hackers 'ATS',  and cruelly  so,  in  my 
opinion, as this had an edge over the latter entry.

Alive starts quietly enough,  a GEM menu! In fact, this is following in 
the footsteps of more modern demos,  where you can 'configure your own' 
options.  Quite  apart  from usual things,  such as monitor type and hz 
settings,  there is also sound surround and interpolation,  and best of 
all,  a detail settings level,  for those people lucky enough to own an 
accelerated  Falcy!  Earx  is the lucky owner of a CT2,  so what he was 
trying  to do,  entering a competition where a CT2 was first prize,  no 
one is quite sure?!

So  it is with a sense of anticipation,  that I set the demo to as much 
as  it can go to.  That is,  a 100hz SVGA screen mode (vital for a full 
expression of one or two effects) and high detail mode.

The  first manifestation of the fact you have got an accelerator  comes 
with  the  progress bar as the demo loads.  It is  satisfyingly  swift, 
and conspicuously unsluggish.

The  demo  starts gradually,  a 'FUN Industries' logo on a watery  blue 
 background,  which  then  starts to ripple,  the logo moves around in a 
larger  virtual  screen area,  the rippling grows more intense  as  the 
music builds.

Then suddenly, just as if it can't contain itself any longer, the first 
'proper' part of the demo shoulder-charges in.

This  is hot,  an amazing screen-switching sequence,   from a series of 
fine  line vector drawn 3D objects to a full colour  crystalline  'FUN' 
hugely  sized screen logo set against a glassy sunlight background  and 
back again, all running beat by beat with the music!

We  are  straight into an older generation of effect next,  this  is  a 
textured 'cheese' cube. Maybe parts of this demo are a bit too Dutch in 
origin?  What  next,  a  porno  textured Torus with the best  that  the 
Amsterdam Red Light district has to offer (grin!)  The textures on each 
face  of  the  cheese,  erm  cube zoom.  Then Earx goes  crazy  with  a 
hyperquick feedback dissolve as the remains of this effect are  smeared 
all over the screen.

There  is  a tunnel,  this first tunnel is an older effect,  a leftover 
from  a  previous  demo,  but  with the 100hz SVGA  screenmode,  it  is 
augmented and improved by a tasteful background picture, which fades in 
and  out.  The tunnel is transparent,  and goes misty and insubstantial 
when  the  picture comes up.  This is a brilliant reworking of a  stock 
effect,  and  can  be  counted as an authentic  'new  generation'  demo 
effect.  Sadly, this was not seen at the EIL competition viewing, which 
was restricted to a 50hz RGB mode 'tunnel only' viewing.

Earx  starts  to follow the path that Tat strode down  with  Sono',  by 
dabbling  with  some nice environment textured 3D objects,  these  have 
orange morphing textures leeching their way on the surface. Set against 
a plain black background but mixed in with the standard torus and spiny 
objects,  are some more complex than normal,  such as a (beer!) bottle, 
and  something that looks like a futuristic toasted sandwich.  Then  it 
intercuts  with  the  manic feedback effect  and  turbo-boosted  screen 
switching of before!
 
A  quick  plasma sunburst effect,  which we fly towards,  then the next 
tunnel,  consisting  of  more 'solid' textures.  We are treated to some 
rotating  within the tunnel along the lines of 'Dream Dimension'!  This 
is very quick, and as far as I know, needs no maths co-processor?
 
A quick,  interlude to show off the vector line objects once more, then 
it  is  a final return to the to enviro-textures with  a  new  morphing 
'Space invader' carefully pre-rendered by the Reservoir Gods, when they 
weren't entertaining all around them with cries of "Heeey!"

The  demo winds back right down again,  to the tranquil watery rippling 
screen,  seen  at  the beginning,  the ripples die right down to a dead 
stop.

It is properly the end, as an 'Atariscne channel' TV station style logo 
frames some quick end credits.

I  liked  this  production,  It  is bold,  fast,  punchy and  well  put 
together,  many refreshing new takes on established demo effects,  with 
an  invigorating  feeling  all over.  Definitely one to show  off  with 
pride.
 
Ratings..

Effects:- 89% -  Technically strong, and fast-paced. 

Graphics:-  83% -  There mainly to serve the effects,  this is more of a 
coders demo with high quality presentation, not so much 'design'.
 
Sound:-  86%  -   Wicked music by Amiga dude  from  Oxyron.  Complements 
effects very well indeed.
 
Overall:- 85% -  Good solid enjoyable effort from FUN!
