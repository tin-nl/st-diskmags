         The instructions say "suitable for age twelve upwards,"
               Now FIND me a twelve year old to fix it!"
 
It's time for a little bit of a rant about the comms side of things,  I 
thought. It isn't really a worthwhile pasttime for a fully grown adult! 
I'm  not talking about the internet and the process of 'getting  on  to 
the net'.  That's alright, and actually has potential for enjoyment and 
education.  It's  the stuff underneath  that is normally hidden away to 
make  it  happen,  that I'm talking about.  That is really a pain and a 
tedious bore! This is the strange upside-down world of "comms."

For a long time, since I first got online in fact, "comms" has remained 
in its rightful place, firmly in the background. A shadowy, mysterious, 
but  benevolent  player in the overall scheme of things.  On one of  my 
Falcys, it still is....

On  the  other Falcon though,  the introduction of a hefty  accelerator 
upset  things  just  a little bit.  Things that were supposed  to  work 
skittered to a  frozen halt.  It was suggested that "something in STinG 
has got corrupted" and a reinstallation might help.  I reinstalled, but 
with no improvement to be seen.

Undeterred,  I tried out a newer version of STinG,  more recent then my 
elderly  (reliable!) v1.08.  This solemnly assured me that mixing older 
components  with this would cause 'bombs or  crashes'.  Notwithstanding 
the  fact  that a large part of this upgrade consisted  of  just  those 
potential  bomb/crash encouraging 'older components',  I tried  anyway. 
Then things started to get very strange...

It  was  about the time that such weird and inhuman  terms  as  "TCP/IP 
Stack"  and "RTS/CTS flow" started to flash up onscreen,  I decided  to 
walk quietly away from it all.

The  problem  with  "comms",  is  that it is a product  of  an  earlier 
generation of computing,  when internet access was a rare and exclusive 
beast,  the connection solutions were handbuilt, and varied from person 
to person,  and ubergeeks were proper genuine social outcasts with more 
spare  time  on their hands than was decent!  

Everybody  has  their own experience of  the days before  everyone  got 
online,  when  they were unlucky enough to rub up against a roomful  of 
"comms"  enthusiasts.  These  people could really bore for Britain,  if 
tedium was ever going to make it as an Olympic level sport! 

With  ever  more people lured on to the internet,  but confronting  the 
reality  of "comms",  it is yet another case of the technology  failing 
dismally to match up to user friendly expectations.

People  on the 'Net can be divided into two classes,  the vast majority  
of folk who have never been anywhere near a bulletin board and only got 
online  when  those  'free'  America  Online  CD-ROMs  started   poking 
invitingly  out  of  the covers of PC Shopper Monthly  and  their  ilk. 
(Bulletin  Board  - BBS - that's another thing,  "comms" people  really 
*love* their acronyms to death!)

Then, there are those people who set out to learn absolutely everything 
about how the telephone system works,  presumably, when reading out the 
phone directory out loud for a hobby got too exciting?  Then they cloak 
it  in such an air of jargon and mystery,  so no reasonable people will 
ever want to try to 'get it', and thus endanger the "comms" mystique.

I  must belong to the first lumpen mass,  as I just don't get the point 
of  endlessly tinkering with TCP/IP's,  and spending an entire  evening 
watching it all crash and reboot. I just want to get online and USE the 
damn thing!

By  the  way,  I'm not gratuitiously trying to offend people who are  a 
'bit' into "comms", and are cleverer than I am, in getting this sort of 
thing  to  work,  but you all know what I mean when I talk about  those 
people  who are "comms" freaks to the virtual exclusion  of  everything 
else,  including  basic notions of cleanliness and social  interaction, 
learned at their mothers knee, and forgotten when the modem first came
into their lives! 

So  to come back to the sarcastic statement right at the  beginning  of 
this  text,  "comms"  is really a twelve year old's kind of sport,  the 
sort  of twelve year old who is very clever,  but he gets nervous if he 
has  to talk to people,  and can be frightened away from your corner of 
the room with loose talk of personal hygiene. But send one around to me 
to  reconcile  STinG with my CT2 Falcy,  and I'll gladly hold  my  nose 
until he's done!
 
Update  -  There was a happy ending in any event.  Falcy went back  for 
repair  one  more  time,  and this seems to have done the  trick,  iffy 
serial port and all! So it wasn't the software then...

                                ----v----

Well  here  it is,  another action-packed issue of Maggie,  this one is 
number  28  in the tree,  and marks a benchmark of nine years  faithful 
reappearing on the Atari scene. We're saving the really big hullabaloos 
until next year's Tenth Anniversary special issue, but hey, what a long 
time  we've  been going!  Nine years,  that makes Maggie old enough to, 
well, not have to go to bed until 9.00pm? 

It's been another long wait,  I'm afraid,  but I hope this lot is worth  
it.  Inside,  there are some tasty info-morsels, such as our incredibly  
rambling Error in Line report and real-time articles, a nicely in-depth 
review  of Centek's Centurbo 2 accelerator (might rename it 'Centrouble 
2',  with  all  the fixing that it needed!) The usual bunch  of  games, 
demos, warm(ish) news, wit, daftness, and more.

I do apologise for the long lead times between issues, but these things 
don't appear as if by magic,  I'm afraid,  and although time has been a 
bit better to me than before, it is still a little bit in short supply.

Still,  enough moaning disguised as thinly veiled apologising,  time to 
get it on and shout "Heeey!" (copyright MSG?)
