In issue #27 of Maggie there was the walkthrough for the first level of 
Running.  This  is  the  one found in the shareware  version.  It  also 
appears  in the registered version.  So there is no need to go  through 
that level again. 

Phew..  it's  taken  a while to get here,  weeks of long nights,  notes 
scribbled  on  scraps  of paper.  Not to mention my fingers  have  been 
reduced to stubs with all the typing I've done lately. But it's finally 
finished and here for you to enjoy.

 Anyway,  enough  of  the waffle,  let's get right down to business,  as 
before  it might be a good idea to print this walkthrough out.  It's  a 
bit long and even I can't remember what I typed.

Primary mission    :  Find the detonator.

Secondary mission  :  Open the safe using a welding torch.


You start off the level in an information lobby with 4 possible  exits. 
Go through the large door opposite the counter, it has the potted plant 
on  the  left hand side of it.  kill the 2 guards waiting on the  other 
side.

Take  the door on the left,  go down the corridor killing a guard and a 
soldier,  pick up the ammo and medikit. At the end of the corridor is a 
small  door,  you  can get in if you really try,  but there is  nothing 
behind it.

Instead  go  through  the  door with a star,  you enter  a  large  room 
containing  crates,  kill the soldier on top of them by either  jumping 
and  shooting  or by standing on a small crate in the far left  of  the 
room. Pick up the ammo, shield and blue key. 

Go  through the other doorway and kill the guards and soldier,  take  a 
look  at  the outside world through the grating at the end.  Shame  you 
can't go outside and have a play 8-(
 
Go  back through the star door into the corridor and turn around.  Near 
to  the star door on the right is a hidden room,  walk through the wall 
to  get  in.  Kill the soldier and guard inside,  pick up the ammo  and 
medikit.

The  other rooms in the corridor have the following inside.  It's up to 
you if you want to go in them.

ROOM 001  - empty

ROOM 002  - ammo

ROOM 003  - medikits, ammo, soldier, there is also a soldier and
            guard patrolling an outside area containing crates.

ROOM 004  - guard and 2 civilians

Exit  this corridor to the one where you killed the 2 guards.  Open the 
blue key door. You are now in the level 1 stairwell.

Kill  the soldier and guard in the stairwell and the guard  behind  the 
grating.  Pick  up the shields,  go up the stairs kill the guard and go 
through  the  door.  Kill  the guard and soldier in  the  corridor,  go 
through the door at the end.

You  are  in a room with a desk.  Turn around to face the door and  you 
will see a switch, flick this and a lift platform at the far end of the 
room will drop,  use the platform and go up.  pick up the ammo,  shield 
and  medikit.  behind the pillar is another switch,  flicking this will 
open a secret door on the lower floor behind which is an ultra scanner, 
go down and get this, use the switch by the door to go up again.

Around the corner is a balcony area,  kill the guard and soldiers, pick 
up  the medikit and ammo.  Save the game at the terminal at the end  of 
the corridor. Turn around and you'll see a small room behind a grating, 
to  get  in  go round to the left in through the window.  Pick  up  the 
 medikit and invisibility.

Go  through the door by the terminal and turn left,  kill the guard and 
soldier, pick up the ammo medikit and shield.

Enter ROOM 108.  Inside is 2 civilians,  some ammo and a terminal. Open 
the door with the star,  kill the soldier on the outside ledge. Try not 
to  fall  off the ledge,  get the medikit and walk along the  ledge  to 
another door with a star, go in.

Inside  this  room with a door on left and a door at the  far  end.  Go 
through  the  door  on the left.  Kill the soldier,  get the  ammo  and 
medikit,  flick  the switch (IT OPENS A SECRET DOOR).  Go back into the 
room and out the other door into a corridor (exiting ROOM 109).

The  secret room is on the right just before the corridor bends to  the 
right,  inside  is  some ammo,  a medikit and shield.  Go back into the 
corridor  and  around the corner,  kill the guard and a soldier in  the 
corridor to the right.

Pick  up the medikit and ammo,  head towards the conference room.  Kill 
the soldiers,  pick up the ammo,  medikit and the new weapon which is a 
machine gun. <big grin>

Enter the conference room, kill the soldier and guard and go around the 
partition.... mmmm nice picture.

Pick up the welding torch behind the lecturn.  You'll need this to open 
the  safe  (secondary mission).  Exit the conference room and save  the 
game at the terminal by the green key door...(looks blue to me)

The  door opposite the terminal is full of ammo,  go in and get all you 
can carry.  Exit the room,  go right,  right and left into the corridor 
where you shot the soldier.

Go in the canteen,  ROOM 110. Kill the guard and soldier..don't hit the 
civilian,  pick up the ammo.  Through another door into ROOM 111.  Kill 
 the 4 guards and the soldier,  pick up the ammo,  enter ROOM 112.  Kill 
the guard, pick up the medikit and the yellow key. Now go back out into 
the corridor.

Enter ROOM 113,  the toilets.  (watch out for George Michael). Not much 
in here really, check out the condom machine, get the condom.

Flush  the  toilets...hehehe Check out the urinals too,  some give  you 
more shield the others give more energy. (Press spacebar) Use them both 
until  shield  and  energy  are at maximum.  This is a  good  place  to 
remember if you run low on energy and there are no power up's about.

Exit  the toilets and make your way back to ROOM 109.  Go out the  star 
door  and  drop of the ledge you walked along earlier and have  a  look 
around, you'll find some ammo a shield and a night viewer.

Drop down the hole by the night viewer and go along the corridor,  kill 
the guard,  ahead you'll see a different coloured brick band. Turn left 
and kill 2 more guards, pick up the plan and the shield.

Carry  along  the corridor past the guard you killed earlier  when  you 
were in the level 1 stairwell,  pick up the ammo.  Carry along,  kill 2 
more guards and pick up more ammo.  You'll find yourself in a room with 
a switch,  flick this swith to open the one way door, it leads you back 
into the information lobby where you started.

Go back through the large door by the potted plant, go through the blue 
key  door.  Up  the stairs to level 1,  through the room with the  lift 
platform, past the balcony area and save the game again at the terminal 
by  the  door.  We came this way earlier and turned left when  we  went 
through the door. This time go right

Go  along  the corridor into ROOM 107,  kill the guard and pick up  the 
medikit and shield.  Go back out into the corridor and along,  there is 
an alcove on the left, kill the guard by the chocolate machine.

Go  into  ROOM 105,  kill the soldier and guard and pick up  the  ammo, 
 enter  the door into ROOM 106.  Kill the soldier and the guard and pick 
up the medikit and the green key.

Go back out into the corridor,  kill the soldier at the end and pick up 
the  ammo.  The  red key door is here (BIG HINT).  Now go back down the 
corridor  to  ROOM 108.  Go out through the star door onto  the  ledge, 
shimmy  along  the ledge and go through the other star door.  You  must 
remember where you are now... you were here a bit earlier.

Head towards the conference room and the green key door,  save the game 
at the terminal.  Go through the green key door,  kill the guard in the 
corridor and the soldier waiting in the stairwell, pick up the ammo and 
shield as you go up the stairs.

Go  along the corridor,  killing a soldier along the way,  turn left at 
the  door with the star (ROOM 204).  Kill the guard and turn left  into 
ROOM 206, kill the guard, go through the door and kill the soldier.

It looks like a dead end but there is a hidden room here, go to the end 
and  press  the spacebar.  Enter this room killing the 3 guards  and  a 
soldier.  Pick up the ammo, medikit, and shields. On a crate you'll see 
a detonator, get this to complete the primary mission.

There is a switch on the ledge above that you get to by using the  lift 
platform.  Flicking  this  switch opens ROOM 204,  in here is a  secret 
area,  head  north in the open area!?  There is invulnerability in here 
somewhere...that's all I'm saying.

One last clue...the red key is nearby,  the key you got when you picked 
up the detonator isn't the red key...even though it's red.  Try the 6th 
panel on the left after you leave ROOM 204..

You've  virtually completed the level now...  you just have to find the 
red key door,  and you know where that is. The exit is very near there. 
But why would you want to leave this level so early, there are loads of 
rooms  and  corridors  that you haven't even been in,  not  to  mention 
hidden rooms and more items to pick up.
