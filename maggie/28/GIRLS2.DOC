 Those  more  elderly,  wee-wee  soaked,  and welfare-dependent  readers 
amongst  you may well remember a ground-breaking article written  by  a 
certain 'Chris H' in Maggie issue 2. (Summer 1990)

Titled  simply,  'Girls  and Computers (and how they don't mix!  - Most 
exclamation marks drastically cut-down in this more sober late nineties 
climate),  it was a semi-serious attempt to focus all of 'Chris H's 40-
odd  watts of brainpower on the fundamental impossibility of  combining 
'Girls' and 'Computers' in the same physical space.

The recommendations from the original article were pretty drastic. They 
wouldn't  have been out of place in health and safety warnings  on  the 
subject of combining concentrated nitric acid, and human skin!

Basically summed up as 1. Don't bother, 2. Forget it, and 3. Just don't 
even  think it,  ok?  We really looked at things from the limited acne-
scarred perspective of restless adolescence,  even those of us in their 
nearly-mid twenties, which was pretty stupid come to think, but hey, if 
you're trying too hard to fit into a new peer group,  then that sort of 
thing  often  happens!  Looking  around  at  the  time,  it  wasn't  an 
unreasonable  viewpoint,  as the happy band gathered around the 'scene' 
end  of Ataridom was unrelievedly male,  and most of it pretty young at 
that time too.

Now all this time later, people have moved on, and it isn't a case of a 
speculative 'maybe' anymore,  but actually having to find a way to! Now 
we ask, in this ninth year revisit, have things got any better? 

Well  maybe,  there  seems to be a partial answer at least,  and it all 
depends on how understanding the female partner is. I'm lucky, as I can 
get  some  time  of my own for my personal brand  of  frenzied  Maggie-
related  keyboard  tapping.  It all hangs on people "Needing their  own 
space."

In the early days of a relationship,  this is nearly impossible to come 
by.   Every   spare  moment  is  spent in the intimate  company  of  your 
beloved,  and outside interests are resented as interference. Computers 
gather  dust,  emails  go unread for days and weeks,  and fellow  scene 
people ask "Have you seen much of that 'Chris H' bloke lately, he seems 
to have gone awfully quiet?"

But  given  time,  the  initial frantic passion winds  itself  down  to 
something  calmer and more easy-going.  The female partner still  loves 
you  dearly,  but is more inclined to notice the mess you leave/you are 
around  the  house,  and  starts  to rediscover the need  for  her  own 
'personal  space'.  Don't  forget,  she hasn't been able to talk to her 
friends much either, whilst she's been seeing you.
 
A  good survival tip here,  always let her broach the difficult subject 
of  'personal space',  don't do it yourself,  no matter how much you're 
tempted  to.  The  timing  is never right if you try to do it,  and  it 
usually ends up as some horrible misunderstanding!
 
After a few months,  you may well find yourself with a bit more time to 
rediscover old and familiar pursuits,  as the drive light on your Atari 
flashes on in a welcoming fashion.

This 'time to yourself business' is still an unpredictable quantity, as 
woman  are  brilliant at changing their minds in 0.0005 seconds  as  to 
whether they want you around of an evening or not. I've had many a pre-
planned evening of happy Maggie-ing changed totally out of shape by one 
little phone call. 

Not  that  I'm  complaining mind,  it's nice to feel wanted  from  that 
direction!
‰
 Things have moved on in other areas. In the original article, 'Chris H' 
considered  the impossibility of a girlfriend playing  computer  games. 
Now,  she  has her own PC,  and loves playing computer games,  the more 
first  person  perspective and violent,  the better!  That said though, 
'her' computer time,  where she does her own things,  and 'my' computer 
time  (Maggie  et  al) are still kept firmly apart.  

The  area where I still managed to steam straight into a brick wall  of 
trauma,  was  when I went away to the big Easter coding party 'Error in 
Line'.  This  seemed  to have been accepted on the surface by her,  but 
with  tears  of anguish on the day itself when I departed.  There  were 
tears  when I came back too,  but these were of relief.  If you want to 
find out just how many different emotions a woman is capable of in  the 
space of half-an-hour, then why not spring something unfamiliar on her, 
like a coding party!  Hopefully, as time develops trust, the going away 
to these sort of things gets easier?

In  general then,  I would say it is just about possible to combine the 
twin forces for good of 'girls' and 'computers'.  That is,  in a living 
apart sort of context. There are still two areas that are unresolved.

Firstly,  living  together  full time puts more pressure  on  'personal 
space'.  This is still possible,  if both parties are sensible and able 
to  compromise.  A lot of relationships vibrate themselves to pieces by 
spending  too much time together,  and from a morbid jealously of  what 
the other might be doing behind their back.

The second,  and even more fundamanental question is, what happens when 
a family starts to appear?

Well,  when  the  child  is small,  then all free time goes out of  the 
window  anyway.  The  other  problem is that from a sharp,  witty,  and 
turned on 'Scene' perspective,  being a 'dad' is naff and PC lamer-like 
in  status.  This is the real challenge facing scene people of whatever 
computer in the longer term,  whether to carry on,  or give up and have 
your  brains sucked out by high street PC box-shifters ("Buy a  PC  for 
the kids education. Easy to use, even dad can cope with it!") 

Previous generations of parents came late to computers and only have  a 
limited appreciation.  For our generatiom,  it's in the blood.  Some of 
our  deepest feelings and core values come from our involvement in  the 
creative scene that grew up with them. It will be very hard to give all 
this  up,  and it will be interesting to see if some people are able to 
carry  on  even after 'settling down'.  In this respect,  we are trail-
blazers for succeeding scene generations.  Go ahead, why not teach your 
baby ASM and C!?

So  this  article  has  to leave a  final  question  open,  'Scene'  or 
'Family'. Can we dare to hope to combine both?
