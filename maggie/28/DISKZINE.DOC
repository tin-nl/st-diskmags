This really is a time for the quiet sifting away of those diskmags  not 
strong  enough  for the icy blasts of the internet,  and  other  apathy 
related factors.

We  have  recently seen the possible departure of Toxic  Mag,  although 
there may be a possibility of resurrection there.  The UK-based general 
interest,  with  a  strong Atari bias magazine/newsletter 'KelAUG'  has 
packed it in. I only found out about that one third hand from a lonely-
sounding contact in Scotland.

Also,  the  HTML-Zine 'Atari Times' has properly decided to give it  up 
once and for all, Croft Soft not really doing anything with the concept 
for the best part of a year, and leaving it to rot in the open air?

As  far as I am aware,  the Czech 'Narsil' and Polish 'Echo'  magazines 
continue  to function,  but they really can't be expected to play  more 
than  a  narrowly national role with the English language not  being  a 
strong point therein.

Not forgetting that on the paper side of things,  Atari Computing, here 
in the UK,  is to leave the building shortly. At least they're quitting 
whilst   they  are  still  ahead,   and  those  people  with  unexpired 
subscriptions will get their money back.

So  it  is in the middle of this dispiriting time,  we turn to look  at 
what  is  left  on the scene.  We start with Undercover 16,  which  has 
gained a new editor, and hopefully a new lease of life too?


                      Undercover Magascene Issue 16

 This starts encouragingly,  as it appears just a few short months after 
the 'crossover' issue 15, which saw the last of Moondog as main editor. 
The new man is former Toxic Mag supremo ST Survivor,  which signifies a 
big change at the top.

New  enthusiasm  for the job seems to have spread to the  Dead  Hackers 
Society,  who  are responsible for the rather lovely bump-mapping intro 
at the start.  This is a very classy production which shows off the new 
DHS enthusiasm for ST demo effects very well.  Incredible to think that 
DHS  and  Undercover were hardly speaking to one another such  a  short 
time ago!

The  intro  finished,  the loader whirrs on to the familiar  Earx-coded 
'hermaphrodite'  menu  shell.   The  menu  graphics  are  cheerful  and 
prominent.  The  shell  works  pretty well and has  been  described  as 
running  under all circumstances.  It certainly worked well enough with 
my  CT2  in full turbo mode,  and it is described as even  being  Magic 
compatible, which I've yet to test out.

I would add that the music player is still prone to get a little  upset 
if you click on it a bit too readily.  Still, a minor fault, a bit like 
the  old 'stuck keyclick' classic when rebooting an ST or  Falcy,  that 
has hung around since TOS 1.0 days.

The  rest  of the shell you know very well by now,  but  includes  such 
niceness  as  16  colour  pictures in text,  a  choice  of  modfile  or 
soundchip  (on  the  Falcon at least),  and coloured text to  give  due 
emphasis  where needed.  It is described as a bit 'flickery' on STFM's, 
where the palette is being interlaced to 4096 colours.

There isn't anything radically different in the text from other  issues 
either.  The  usual mix of Scene news and rumours,  short(ish) demo and 
game  reviews,  party  reports,  and  the rest of it following  closely 
behind with lavish ASCII art bolted on in many cases.

This  issue does have the feeling of being a little bit rushed to  make 
whatever  deadline  ST Survivor had set for it,  and a lot of  articles 
were very short, particularly where the program reviewed was relatively 
small.  The  effect seems to have been to get as many entries into  the 
article  listings,  without  thinking how many of the smaller  articles 
could  really  be wrapped up into a lesser number of  bigger  and  more 
meaty textfiles?

The other thing which was apparent,  was that a very large part of this 
issue  of Undercover was written by ST Survivor on his own,  and  there 
seemed  to  be  a  bit of a sparseness  of  material  from  third-party 
contributors  (He gets my *fullest* understanding and  sympathy  here!) 
The  usual suspects rallied round,  of course,  and I enjoyed reading a 
reasonable and objective review of Maggie 27,  by the Paranoid,  and he 
only missed the point once or twice.  (I agree that parts of the humour 
section  last  time  around,  were not of the best,  but I thought  the 
second-rate  internet  filler material,  rather than Mr Pinks  original 
and newly written text, would have been early candidates to be slated?)

Other notables are, of course the Scene News section, the Pre-Millenium 
Party  report and realtime,  an interesting 'Last Party 98' report from 
Grey.  I  also  enjoyed an article from Evil of DHS about his  extended 
Centurbo 2 installation fiasco. This sounded very familiar although his 
conclusions  about  the  upgrade and mine,  to be seen in  this  Maggie 
issue, may well differ slightly. 

A  lot of the games and demo reviews seem to be dealing with  a  mostly 
uninspiring post-EIL bunch, or leftovers of EIL, in the case of the EGO 
demo.  The  reviews  tend to reflect this in their style  and  content. 
Also,  UCM  gets around Paranoid's dissaproval of the humour section in 
Maggie, by not having one here. Still, that is down to personal choice, 
and isn't lobbed in their direction as a criticism.

So  how  is ST Survivor settling into the UCM editors  chair?  Well  it 
seems  he  is off to a flying start,  rebuilding goodwill on the  scene 
where  this  may have been dented by  Moondogs  over-personal  approach 
previously. He also scores a lot of points by trying for a higher issue 
frequency.  This  is  welcome,  in an age,  where lead times between new 
issues of other diskmags (I know, I know!) are getting ever longer.

On the other hand,  a willingness to kick out new issues more often can 
lead  to  quality dilution,  both with the subject matter under  review 
(they only had a relatively poor bunch to pick from in this short time) 
and in the depth and quality of the articles about them.  By the way, I 
hope  MC Laser didn't have to manually type in all of those long  music 
lyrics  on his short demo reviews?  If he did,  then it looks like he's 
undergoing some sort of cruel and unusual punishment in the UCM Gulag!?

The  overall quality of the product hasn't gone down though,  and  with 
the  new  editors 'Can Do' attitude,  who knows what the next UCM  will 
bring? 
 
Summary:- Cool Earx custom shell, ST and Falcon 'scene zine', good demo 
scene   coverage,   this   issue,   a  little  bit  rushed,   prospects, 
interesting, with the new editor.

 Overall - 7 out of 10 


                          Aftercover Magazine?

 Might otherwise be known as the bits that missed UCM 16 by 30 minutes?

An ultra-simple but appealing shell, based on the 'hermaphrodite shell. 
A  little bit of top and bottom border graphics,  and a very functional 
looking  scrolly menu selector.  A cheerful and friendly soundchip tune 
plays. It works fine on the Falcon.

The  text  displayer  is lightning fast on a 16  mhz  machine,  it  may 
threaten  to  go back in time with a 50 mhz  Centurbo?  Remember  arrow 
keys, spacebar, and erm, that's it.

The  text is a mixture of things written for UCM 16 by Dejam  and  505. 
These  missed  the  deadline for UCM 16 by 30 minutes  (!?)  These  are 
fourteen articles in total.

A  brief  intro kicks off,  then a short "no EIL in 2000"  text.  Other 
highlights  include  a (sorely missed from UCM 16)  'Tracking  Corner', 
with  a  selection of fascinating facts and news  about  the  musically 
inclined.   There  was  also  a  very  good  'Don't  Diss'  article,  a 
masterly analysis by 505 of the recent history of the Atari scene,  and 
the  whingeing that dwelt within it.  Reading about 505's hassles  with 
Deutchse Telekomm made us feel grateful for good old BT, almost...

(BT managed to kill my phone entirely for three weeks around last Xmas, 
I'm  still  waiting for the compensation that their  charter  states  I 
should be getting!)  Hang on,  I've found a music changer?  Great, I was  
 getting bored with that other tune!   That makes it eleven articles, and 
three soundchip tunes, which I thought were music reviews at first.

Dejam  handles  the  demo reviews ably,  there are a  batch  of  cinema 
reviews to finish, some smaller articles, and.....

That's  your  lot.  Not a great diskmag,  but a few nice articles  that 
shouldn't  really  have  missed  going into UCM  16,  and  not  a  huge 
download. Not a bad effort for a one-off.


                             ‰News and Stuff

 There  has been "a bit of a flip-up",  as Felice might have said,  with 
the  non-release  of the briefly seen at Error in Line  'Psycho  Babble 
Project" Maggie special issue.

This  got  fatally hung-up on the wrong sort of music  player,  working 
okay on a Falcon,  but not a bog-standard ST,  which was sort of wrong, 
as it was based on the Maggie ST shell.

At this time,  it still awaits release, 99% complete, but awaiting that 
last  spurt  of energy to finish it off.  I've felt frustrated  in  the 
past,  to  hear  of umpteen unfinished or partially finished games  and 
demos  which  have  subsided  into waves of  apathy.  Now  I've  got  a 
neglected orphan all of my own!

At this time,  I'm still not sure whether to let it go out as it is, or 
to incorporate it into something else.  Whatever happens is going to be 
after this regular issue of Maggie hits the streets.

Additionally,  there  is  an idea for a new compilation issue  of  past 
Maggie  issues for the year end,  but this will be specifically themed. 
No more news on that just yet.

Narsil,  the Czech-zine has reached issue 33,  and news reaches us that 
Toxic Mag aren't ready to give up just yet! Maybe there is hope for the 
future of a diverse diskzine-dom after all.

 CiH.
