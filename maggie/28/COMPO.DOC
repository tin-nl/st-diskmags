                        - Pictures and Sound! -
 
      ˆThe DHS Online 4 colour graphics and Sid-Sound Competitions
 

There were a lot of interesting online competitions organised by thoses 
lovely  Dead Hackers people.  These two feature lots of lovely pictures 
and sounds!

  The Picture competition... 

Not just any old pictures, but like those limited byte size intros, the 
lucky artist is limited to expressing themselves with a maximum of four 
colours, and a screen mode of 160 x 100 pixels (half ST-Low).

A dozen people decided they were up to this one, here is their tale...

(In reverse order)

  'Falcon's Revenge' by Tito. 
This  was more of a two-colour entry,  in a home-made (not recognisable 
as  any  known style) cartoon,  showing a panicked sweating Bill  Gates 
being attacked by an enraged bird of prey. If this was judged the least 
worthy, don't worry, I wouldn't have done any better.

  'Atari Rules' by DMA-SC .
The  soundchip man bites,  with a Bart Simpson/boyz in the Hood  styled 
crossover, with the proud legend 'Atari in da face!'

  'Get a Brain' by ST Survivor .
The first effort by hardened graphics man,  and Magascene author,  gets 
no  further than this lowly ranking.  As it is a nice and cheery French 
demo styled smiley face, it really deserved better.

  'Thomp' by Thomas of New Beat  .
Thomas  goes  for a pencil shaded style with his 'sketch'  of  a  face, 
looks  deliberately  half-finished.  and a nice touch with  the  shadow 
under the signature.

  'Beerthn' by Bezerk .
There  isn't too much of this one,  a distinct Medieval woodcut  style, 
looks like a plague-striken peasant out on the beer!

  'Compo' by Zoolook .
Zoolook  goes  for  something  very  reminiscent  of  a  Gameboy  title 
screen here. The theme is a fantasy/RPG 'Eye in the sky' looking over a 
brooding landscape.

  'Final 4' by Paranoid .
Neat anti-PC joke set to a newspaper cartoon strip style,  it has to be 
the Paranoid behind it!

  'Corinthian' by Cosmosh .
Interesting demonstration of technique and handling limited amounts  of 
colour in this one.  A Corinthian column, as an  architectural drawing, 
and featuring a brilliant pseudo-graduated change of background  colour 
from one end of the picture to the other. This stippling rocks!

  'Pain' by Britelight .
Boldly  drawn 'de-rezzed' style head and shoulders staring up.  A green 
'static' or interference background. Stark and powerful.

   'Passion' by ST Survivor .
Second  shot  at the title by top graphics man,  rapidly  turning  into 
undead  Moondog when the next issue of UCM coincides with a full  moon.  
Quite a soft and subtle Fuji wrapped in a  wraith.

  'Hope' by Modmate .
Third place goes to the man normally breathing hard down Agent T's neck 
in these sort of competitions. Not quite close enough this time though, 
but  a  fine effort with an exquisitely drawn Dove of  peace  which  is 
shaded to look a higher resolution than it is.

  'Cameron' by Havoc .
Second  place  goes  to EIL sixteen colour winner,  who  returns  to  a 
robustly  heterosexual  theme,  a  female face looks back at you  in  a 
strongly  drawn  manner that hardly notices that a dozen  or  so  extra 
shades seem to be missing from what ought to be a sixteen colour piccy!

  'T-Art' by Agent T .
And  the  winner  is...  Agent  T,  with a four colour smash hit  of  a 
unspecific  bloke,  looks a bit like Superman before he got his licence 
to superhero about the place?

                              ----------

There  was a bonus piccy by Spiny of Torment,  which didn't quite  make 
the competition. This was included, and is an ultra-cute bunny 'n puppy 
mix. Not sure where that would have come, not in the top four though.

The intro was neat,  with a pumping Sid-style music by Dma-Sc, and four 
colour  blur-tunnels,  which look like they are interlaced for a higher 
resolution or smaller pixel screen mode.

Technically  interesting too,  as it was written as a dual program  for 
both Amiga and Atari,  on a development system designed to make porting 
over effects from one machine to the other a lot more feasible! 

This competition was a damn fine effort,  and was probably the best one 
 this year, apart from the Whip Plugin competitions.


                         The Sid Sound Compo...
 
Another  bunch of entries,  this time for those soundchip tinkerers who 
fancied themselves as SID Sound designers..

Let's see how they got on;

 
No. Composer               Title                   Score
--------------------------------------------------------
01  Dma-Sc / Sector One    Flying over the earth      45

02  Tao / Cream            Torture                    40

03  Mc Laser / .tSCc.      Destroya                   23

04  Viking / Mind Design   Fairy                      20

05  Baggio / Wildfire      Magmakt                    13

06  Aio / Toys             Revive me                  12

07  Milhouse / The X       Miliways                    9

08  Evil / DHS             Arpa                        7

09  Havoc / FUN            Thissux                     3

10  Blind-Io               Decadent                    2


 Another  well-presented intro with a pretty little mouth.  Sleek  intro 
sequence gives way to shadebob sworls mutating into flame effects  over 
moonrock  DHS logo.  Various keys are awaiting fingers to activate  the 
 variosu competition entry tunes, and three bonus tracks.

All  of  them are restricted in the competition,  to using the  default 
voice set for the SID Sound designer.

These  are  harder to tell apart from a quality viewpoint  than  the  4 
colour  pictures.  It  is  notable  that the purist  music  people  and 
soundchip  experts  in particular,  had the edge when the final  scores 
were counted.  DMA-SC somehow breathing extra space and atmosphere into 
that  default sound set,  and turning out to be the convincing  winner, 
just pipping Tao at the winning post.

I  personally  liked  the Viking's fourth place entry,  a  nice  catchy 
'hook', if a little bit short.
