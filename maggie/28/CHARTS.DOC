 18.     IT                                         (SHADOWS) [   1 ]

Tat may have defected to the dark  side (Sony Cambridge), but his soul 
lives on in the form of  the  epic  'Sonolumineszenz'. As has been the 
 case since its release, it  absolutely steamrollers the opposition. Is 
this the pinnacle of Falcon demos? Can it ever get better than 'Sono'? 
Someone will have to pull out a  major surprise at SV2000 for Sono not 
to be sitting proudly atop the charts next issue.

'Alive' sees Fun reborn  as  a  demo  force  to  be reckoned with, and 
'Mahababharata' sees the birth of new crew with a bright future.

DHS are strong as ever. Cobra and Mystic Bytes take a couple of places 
each, which bodes well for the forthcoming party in Poland.

 29.     JAPTRO                                   (HOLOCAUST) [   1 ]

Whilst the Falcon demo scene is relatively static, the 99 releases for 
the ST have blasted their way  to  the  top of the charts. Leading the 
pack is Checkpoint's superb 'Sure Trip'  - surely the highlight of EIL 
99.

Keops and crew  take  the  second  spot  with  the  brilliant 'Virtual 
Escape', and another retro collection from France, 'Nostalgico', takes 
the bronze.

If SV2000 can produce ST demos half  as  good  as EIL, we are in for a 
treat.

  7.     BURNING WATER                     (THE CHAOS ENGINE) [   1 ]
 
Its been there since the  jurassic  period  and  it look likes staying 
there for another millenium.  The  Inter/TSCC/Newline partnership that 
made Terrorise Your Soul have another gold medal to squeeze onto their 
already overflowing shelves.

  8.     POWER OF 8MHZ                              (T.O.Y.S) [   6 ]
  9.     SURPRISE                              (MYSTIC BYTES) [   3 ]

The DHS boys do it again, confidently taking first and second place in 
the 4K charts, whilst New  Beat  complete  the podium for Sweden. They 
may not have a chart topping  megademo,  but  DHS reign supreme in the 
kingdom of the 4ktro.

  6.     SUNQUAKE                            (RESERVOIR GODS) [   4 ]

The EIL 99 winning  128  bytetro  takes  the  top,  fighting off stiff 
competition from Checkpoint's sublime rot  zoomer. Whilst DHS dominate 
the 4k category, RG have  a  stranglehold  over  the smallest demos in 
existence. But like Take That say, "it  only takes a minute to write a 
128bytetro". Or something.

  9.     BUGWUERST                                      (NUN) [   4 ]

It wowed the crowds in Germany. It rocked the dancefloors of cream and 
gatecrasher. The Poets Of Bombay's  summer  smash takes joint top spot 
with the wittily named HIV Demo.

'Running' runs away with  it  again,  and  fans  of RDT's first person 
shooter should be pleased to  know  that  they  are working on a Milan 
port. Rebelsoft's  DSP  bashing  'COC3D'  takes  second,  followed  by 
eternal favourite 'Tautology 2'. Willie  is  in  at number 4, we can't 
wait for it to come out.

California! No doubt about it, Epyx's  original ("and still the best", 
(c) the kids, 1999 ) lynx  sports  game takes the gold medal. Possibly 
because this came bundled with  the  lynx  and no-one else bothered to 
buy anything else.

Its very late. This article is well overdue. I must try to stop making

The Giant dutchie wreaks havoc on  the  charts by splitting the golden 
duo of Agent T and mod and coming a valiant second. Mr T still manages 
to brush off  the  competition.  Chasing  the  leaders  are  a gang of 
frenchies. Possible on cycles, with onions around their necks.

Anyone who was  at  EIL  would  have  seen  the  hushed  awe  in which 
musicians, and other atari kids,  held  Tao  in.  It was like having a 
walking and talking (although he did less of the latter) legend in our 
presence. Recent  cream  productions  have  once  again  showcased his 
genius, and his victory here was never in any doubt.

Big ups also to  Dma-SC  with  a  great  second  place which serves to 
highlight the revival of sector one.

Mighty, mighty close. For the first time, UCM was a major challenge to 
Maggie in  these  charts  -  and  could  easily  have  won  them.  The 
combination of Maggie's inactivity and a  revitalised UCM team lead by 
ST Survivor show that  there  is  real  competition  in  this area. If 
anyone was going to win  this  charts  this  time, UCM looked the most 
likely.
 
This is great as it gives  both  magazines  a real incentive to strive 
for bigger and better things.  This  will  be a very, very interesting 
category to see next time. Can  ST  Survivor maintain the momentum and 
snatch the top spot from maggie?

The baseball cap wearing German's  asccii  based  grafitti has a great

Yes, its true, he does find  other  things  to  do with his life apart 
from sitting on  irc.  His  tireless  updating  of  his  webpages, and 
constant stream of quality  demos  make  Evil  the  atari scene's most 
valuable status. Although he claims to  have given up drinking for the 
year, we think he should have a quick one, just to celebrate.

Once again, the Swedes sit proudly  atop  the  super league - they are 
fast becoming the Manchester  United  of  the  atari  demo scene. Both 
Cream and Checkpoint turn in excellent  performance to come in 2nd and 
4th respectively.

The new UCM team underline  their  pedigree  with 7th spot, whilst the 
ever improving Sector One take  9th.  'Virtual Escape' helps keops and 
 friends complete the top 10.

What will the new millenium bring?  Hopefully more great ST and Falcon 
demos to shake the cobwebs out of  some of these charts. SV2000 should 
throw up some contenders.

Big thanks to everyone who participated in this chart.
