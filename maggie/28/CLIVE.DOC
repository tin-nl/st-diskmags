This  may well come to nothing,  but I thought it would be interesting 
to report in case it does. Everyone knows who (Sir) Clive Sinclair is, 
his  innovations  on the hardware front.  It was a bit of a step  from 
'Horace  Goes Skiing',  to the the pile of pants that was the Sinclair 
C5,  but  there  you  go.  Now it looks like the man who gave  us  the 
hardware  platform that made 'Jet Set Willy' possible,  is planning  a 
comeback!
 
This  little  factoid is made up of two parts.  The news  report  that 
announced the Linux box,  and an earlier interview from the mainstream 
UK  magazine  'Personal Computer World',  which reveals Clive's  deep-
rooted discontent with things done the Wintel way,  and which may have 
been the trigger for this current spasm of Sinclair activity?

British Inventor Eyes Linux

Sir Clive Sinclair single-handedly launched the UK's home PC market in 
the  early  80's.   Now,  Britain's  most  famous  high-tech  inventor 
reportedly has a new project: a low-cost, portable Linux machine.

The  portable  computer  will  cost less than  half  the  price  of  a 
comparable Wintel box,  according to reports in the Sunday Express and 
VNU Net. 

"The  standard  PC  is  expensive because of  Intel  [chips]  and  the 
[Microsoft  Windows operating system],  which is demanding of memory," 
Sinclair  told VNU Net.  "The reason why my machine will be cheaper is 
that it will use a lot less memory,  a lower-cost processor, a simpler 
power supply and a lower-cost operating system."

But it may be two years before it is brought to market, Sinclair said.

Though  absent  from  the computer business for more  than  15  years, 
Sinclair  still  holds  a  special place in  the  hearts  of  Britons. 
Affectionately known as "Uncle Clive," he was responsible for a number 
of brilliantly innovative products,  some of which thrived and some of 
which tanked.

Sinclair's inventions were marked by a streak of eccentricity. PCs had 
rubbery  keyboards and ran on battery power.  A wristwatch featured  a 
built-in, though barely audible, transistor radio. 

His low cost PCs -- the ZX 80,  the ZX 81, and the Spectrum, nicknamed 
"Speccy"  -- found their way into millions of homes in the UK and  are 
still  worshipped  on  fan sites and in emulators  that  recreate  the 
machines in PC-compatible software. 

Sinclair  was  also responsible for a host  of  breakthrough  consumer 
products, including the country's first digital watch, calculator, and 
pocket  TV.  In  1985,  Sinclair  launched an electric car,  the C5,  a 
spectacular flop that marked the beginning of the end of his ventures, 
and resulted in his selling off his existing company to rival Amstrad. 
 
Despite  a  lower profile in recent years,  Sinclair has  not  stopped 
inventing.  His  miniature  X1 Button Radio and Zeta II,  an  electric 
motor for bicycles,  have been selling well,  according to reports. He 
also  recently  retired as chairman of MENSA,  the society for  people 
with high IQs.

Sinclair's love affairs have also put him in the tabloids, including a 
recent  tryst  with a former lap-dancer,  as detailed recently in  the 
Sunday Express.

The   english  computer  magazine   "Personal  Computer  World"   (PCW) 
celebrated  the  20th anniversary with a special May  issue  1998.  The 
"bigger than ever" issue with three CD-ROM (one from AOL) showed a ZX81 
and  SPECTRUM  on the title page among other machines.  On  CD-ROM  the  
ZX81-emulator from Paul Robson and the Speccy emulator Z80 from  Gerton 
Lunter.  In the magazine a review of the past 20 years with pictures of 
ZX80,  ZX81  and  SPECTRUM  and of course a statement  from  Sir  Clive 
Sinclair   about  his  views  of IT-developement  in  the  past  times. 

Sir Clive Sinclair, British computing pioneer: 

"When I started out, I was just interested in getting people interested 
in computers. It was very exciting then. There was a lot of innovation. 
There's no technical change now - it's all just Wintel stuff. It's just 
all got bogged down. The designs are very clumsy  nowadays. They're not 
taking risks at all, they're just making the same sort of machines. The 
only  breath of fresh air is Psion.  They're terrific and they go their 
own way. Windows CE is a hope, as well." 

"I  thought computers today would be used for the same kind of  things 
they  were  used for then.  I could see them becoming ubiquitous.  But 
what  has  disappointed me greatly has been how  little  change  there 
really has been.  Take parallel computing - it's ridiculous, it should 
have  happend  by  now.  Computers  should be hundreds  of  time  more 
powerful  than they are now.  They're also absurdly expensive for what 
they  do.  Very little of the price is from processing power.  I don't 
use the internet at the moment. I get frustrated by the speed. If they 
would  sort  that out,  then I would use it.  But I think it's a  most 
marvellous thing,  it's amazing what can be done with it. I just don't 
want to use it while it's so slow."
