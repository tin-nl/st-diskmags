The acronym BT will bring one of two images to most peoples minds, and 
if you are  thinking  of  telephone  companies  you  may  as well stop 
reading now. If you are  thinking  'epic  house',  then you are in the 
right place, but six years out of date.

It's true that on 1994's "Ima",  BT's combination of ambient noise and 
house beats on 12 minute  tracks  invented  the epic house sound which 
was championed by the  likes  of  Sasha.  His second album, 'E.S.C.M', 
left that behind in favour of trance, breakbeat and, erm, 'rock'.

BT was unhappy about  the  restrictions  of  his  record  label ( Paul 
Oakenfold's "Perfecto" label ), and quite soon after 'E.S.C.M'. But it 
didn't take him long to get set up with the Pioneer label. 

BT 1, Oakey 0.

'E.S.C.M' was an undulating  soundscape.  It  had  peaks, "The Road To 
Lostwithiel" and notably "Flaming  June",  and troughs "Solar Plexus". 
"Movement in still life"  is  equally,  if  not  more, diverse. But it 
flows better and sparkles like a diamond.

It opens with the  Grandmaster  Flash  sampling  title  track, cut and 
paste samples, scratches and mad analog synths. Embracing the sunshine 
part 2 this ain't.

When BT and Sasha collaborate, you  would expect a shimmering, melodic 
trance tune. You would  not  expect  the  nineties electro 'Ride'. Ace 
nevertheless, and  they  should  really  make  more  tracks  under the 
 monicker they used when they put out  the  white label of this track - 
"Two Phat Cunts".

BT embraces the future by enlisting  the mad skills of nu-skool breaks 
producers Adam Freeland and Kevin  Beber on "Madskillz-Mic Chekka" and 
the mighty "Hip Hop  Phenomenon"  -  unfortunately  this  is an edited 
version of the original.

If you remember the dreamy house of"Remember" from "E.S.C.M." you will 
be well aware of the vocal  talents  of  Jan Johnston. She returns for 
"Mercury and Solace" an absolutely  beautiful,  euphoric track. One of 
the best things BT has ever  done  -  again this is an edited version, 
you should really check the  mix  on Sasha's recent Global Underground 
compilation to appreciate the true beauty of this track.

Former Opus-3 vocalist ( think "It's A Fine Day", or more pertinently, 
Orbital's "Halcyon+on+on" ) and  current  Global Communication warbles 
"Running Down The Way Up". It's  nice  enough, but doesn't quite reach 
the peaks of "Mercury and Solace".

Elsewhere, there are collaborations  with  DJ  Rap  on  "Giving Up The 
Ghost" - he even  gets  the  minx  of  drum'n'bass  to sing. And those 
looking for BT's classy  trance  sound  won't  be disappointed either, 
there is  the  fantastic  "Namstai",  co-produced  by  Paul  Van  Dyk. 
Meanwhile "GodSpeed" is very much the  sequel  to "Flaming June" - and 
that's meant as a complement.

The album ends with  BT  singing  on  "Satellite".  He  actually has a 
rather good voice,  reminiscent  of  Deep  Dish  producer's  vocals on 
"Stranded".

"Movement In Still Life" is another  superb record from BT. It pounds, 
it sparkles, it growls, it  shimmers,  it  soars.  It is bursting with 
life, emotion and soul. It is a really moving collection of music.

After all this time, BT is still a pioneer.
