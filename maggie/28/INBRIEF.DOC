               Lots of bits and pieces of demos and intros

 Here lie all the other demos and intros that didn't get their own  home 
elsewhere  in  the mag.  One thing that hasn't been lacking is  a  good 
turnover of releases, many old school, some fresh out of the packaging, 
all of them looking interesting for sure....

 .Mahabharata.  (Falcon 030)
We're  in  there with a brand new Falcon demo,  from a brand new  crew, 
fresh  from freezing Finland!  (How's the daytime temperature up  there 
at the minute guys, at least minus twenty centigrade!?) 

The crew are called 'Fit',  and aren't such a new crew,  as they inform 
me  that they have been going since 1991,  as a multiformat crew.  They 
have  only just got around to looking at the Falcon as a 'new'  format! 
There  is also the involvement of a couple of old Atari sceners,  Sturm 
formerly of the Admirables, and Acorn, ex of Flash in here too.

This  particular demo is interesting on its own  merits,  'Mahabharata' 
comes  strongly  Indian-flavoured  in its design,  sort  of  a  reverse 
tribute  to the somewhat tongue in cheek 'Poets of Bombay'.  The  whole 
thing  is well-presented from beginning to end.  Nothing too  gee-whiz, 
but  there  are  a couple of genuinely  impressive  effects  in  there. 
Firstly,  a  lovely 'sun-burst' effect used strategically when  various 
gods and goddesses appear onscreen. There is also a superb zoom effect, 
where  a bunch of different coloured textured tiles zoom out to form  a 
parts or 'pixels' in a much bigger image!

The  graphics are cool,  the music entirely appropriate to the mood  of 
the  demo,  and  there is a brilliant ending where the music slurs  and 
slows down.

We look forward to further productions from Fit with some keenness!

 Overall, 80% - By Shiva! Great debut, nice design, give them a curry!

‰
 .Oldiez.  (ST)
This  was  a production for the LTP3 party,  from French group  Blabla, 
with a little involvement from Ribbon, and Count Zero. 

It  is an appealing mixture of old and new,  and starts very much as an 
exaggerated  timewarped  late eighties screen,  a huge  (single  letter 
fullscreen) text scrolly lunges upward,  a texty distorty thing wobbles 
in the background, Count Zero starts in on the ziks. This is so elderly 
in feel, it is frankly uncomfortable, even on an STe!

Next,  a  neat rotator and zoomer with a bit of refractive wobble,  more 
contemporary, some nice still gfx fit themselves in between sequences.

Back to the zoomer distorter,  which turns into a texture tunnel. Which 
gets  very  very  quick towards the end.  This little  demo  closes  on 
another  old  effect,  a  scrolletext  over a double  layer  of  moving 
parallax patterns,  but with a very new SIDsound tune to play out on.
‰
 In  the  end,  this  is  a strange mix,  the 'old' and 'new'  parts  so 
blatantly  different,  they  make an uneasy partnership.  Nice  quality 
though,  let's  see something more substained in the design  department 
next time, then Blabla will be talking sense!

 Overall, 73% - Too haphazard a feel, but high quality effects.

 
 .The Lost Screen.  (ST)
An 18kb intro,  entered into the Oldschool section of the LPT3 Party by 
Oxythan.  It  is  really  nothing  to look at.  A  bottom  'LED'  style 
scrolltext, four old style analogue hi-fi indicator vu-meters, and four 
speaker cones which vibrate in time with the individual sound channels. 
the  count Zero tune has been especially crippled for the occasion,  as 
it seems to be missing one of its channels.

 I  just didn't like this screen at all,  and it would have been  sorely 
mediocre, even in the good old days...

 Overall,  35% - Only purpose it served was to ruin a classic Count Zero 
zik!

 
 .Memorial.  (ST)
Another  return  from one of the classic French groups  Dune.  This  is 
their entry for the LPT3 Oldschool competion.  It is unclear if this is 
re-using  old  source code they've kept hidden for all these  years  or 
not,  but  it wouldn't surprise me to find that they have written  this 
from scratch.

Certainly,  the music, by DMA SC and Kanewood is an intersting blend of 
half  contemporary  SID  sound,  and some older style Count  Zero  type 
classic YM sound synthesis!

It  is  short  and sweet,  a stark simple cube smartly shading  onto  a 
red background with opening text.

A cool logo gives way to a great dot-bubble burst effect,  which in its 
turn,  makes  way for a 3D cross spinning within a rotating  dot-bubble 
made up of many pixels.

There is a quick display of warping polys, then a quick change of speed 
with a gorgeous fantasy scene drawn by Mic.

An  elephant badge logo is surrounded by a wildcopper  scrolltext.  Too 
soon,  it  is  time for some end credits,  overlaid over a superb  mono 
newspaper style cartoon.

This  entry is not lacking quality,  and displays all the polished  and 
assured  hallmarks of a long-established demo crew,  doing  'oldschool' 
brilliantly,  even  as you itch to see what they might be capable of in 
the way of contemporary effects?

 Overall, 80% - They make it look effortless! 


 .Halloween.  (ST)
Time for some more new kids on the block.  These are French dudes,  Zed 
and CosmosH of FLA. Very much at the beginning of a long and successful 
demo  making  career  (we  hope!)  Here  is  something  that  could  be 
considered their debut effort.

Firing  up  the STe,  and a knackered screen results,  there is  music, 
there  is a crude 'raster bar' effect that suggests I'd be  better  off 
trying  without  medium  resolution!   Never  mind,  when  the  initial 
excitement  of  getting  their code to work  wears  off,  more  careful 
planning, and little things like resolution switching will follow.

Second go results in a fiery 'FLA' logo piccy,  which fades,  then some 
credits appear.

The main screen is in the form of a halloween style pumpkin face,  with 
an  obligatory,  and reasonably informative text scroller beneath.  Not 
being  distracted  by anything else happening onscreen,  you  read  the 
text. That is it.

This is definitely a debut effort,  not too exciting at this stage, but 
I should think they will gain ground quickly enough.

 Overall, 45% - I'm sure they will rapidly get better!

 
 .Twitching Flannels.  (ST)
A  legendary  UK Supergroup from the early nineties  makes  a  stunning 
return to the Atari scene,  in this production, widely seen at the Pre-
Millenium Party last summer. Torment are proud to give you...

 (Is that too much build-up?)  

You  have  to fiddle around with this  little-remembered  thing  called 
 'MSA'. Then you have to find a spare blank disk. Quite a shock to hard-
disk complacent Atari veterans. After creating your disk, then boot it, 
and  your  floppy  drive  on the dear  old  STe  goes  into  warp-spasm 
bootload, a frantic rhythm recreated from yesteryear. 

Starts  smartly  with some sineous rainbow coloured raster  bars  which 
gradually warp more and more.  Over these,  some textual introductions, 
ending  in  humourous logo time,  as the title of the  demo  'Twitching 
Flannels', is revealed.

We  jump  into a  much older screen,  left-to-right starfield,  a  huge 
lumbering logo all overhangs in a neo-brutalist eighties style,  a sine 
scroller  does  the dull necessary stuff.  and more subtly,  there is a 
distorting and changing pattern in the logo colours,  this is damn old. 
We  are informed in the end credits that the oldest parts of  the  demo 
are up to eight years old! We have to ask, is this a record?

Another standby from the old days,  a satanic logo with  Mad Max music, 
goes all 'infinite sprite' on us in fullscreen!

The  endpart comes up,  an ambient minimal and moody modfile,  with its 
load  of  end  credits  and a receding  'rear  window  view  in  Elite' 
starfield. 

Parts of the design were very good.  This was a reasonable, rather than 
an  inspired release,  but I think Torment are capable of doing a  good 
modern  demo  with spot-on presentation,  if they choose to  put  their 
minds to it?

 Overall, 70% - It's, erm, old! 


 .Japemo.  (ST) 
 I'm  not  quite sure how to take this strange release  from  Hylst,  ex 
member  of  the Manga Maniacs.  This demo is a preview of a  four  disk 
megademo/Manga demo, the idea of which seems to promise such a lot.

 In fact,  what we get,  are a parade of half-finished looking GFA coded 
effects  and  the  odd  low quality still  piccy,  many  of  them  most 
charitably described as verging on the brink of 'terrible'.

It  makes  an  interesting comparison with new  kids  'FLA',  but  this 
looks  less  like  a first attempt,  and more like something  that  has 
passed its sell-by date a long time ago.  A point in its favour is that 
it is runnable on a Falcon.

Not sure where this one is going next?
 
Overall,  40%  -  For  a  preview,  it doesn't increase  the  sense  of 
anticipation, unfortunately.

 
 .Animal Mine unreleased screens.  (ST)
SLiPPY of Vectronix,  sometimes known as MC of Animal Mine took note of 
the  recent  revival  of things with ST in the title,  and  decided  to 
release some unfinished business of his to an interested Atari world. 

These  are  all  fine on an ST or STe,  I left my Falcon  to  one  side 
though.
        
 BBS advert ,  A BBS advert for the defunct DREAMSCAPE II, promising such 
1993  era luxuries as 28.8k modem access and a "cool and tough  sysop!" 
An  unremarkable  screen done in a four colour ANSI graphics  and  text 
style,  a  bit  like  the  front-end of  the  actual  BBS.  Interesting 
soundtrack,  which  is  a  chippy sounding modfile,  or strange  hybrid 
amigasound format.

 3D Reset,   A reset-screen for an unfinished dentro 'Infinity.  This one 
actually  needs the reset button pressing to start it.  You get a  neat 
screen,  blue  background with pseudo 'side borders killed off' effect, 
top and bottom caption graphics,  a small scrolltext at the bottom, and 
swirly  dot  patterns made up of many dots in four  colours.  Music  is 
classic YM. 

 Dreamscape,   A little dentro  to advertise the BBS.  This production is 
more developed and demolike than before.

Firstly,  an option to select music at the beginning,  choice of three. 
you get classic early SID voice, something like Scavenger would do.

First  are  some  credits,  on a letterbox style  screen,  a  furiously 
spinning  Animal  Mine logo sits at the bottom,  some standard  textual 
thrills,  There  are a bunch of higher-res fine dot sineous patterns on 
white  background,  very  coolly done.  Brief pause for a nicely  drawn 
Atari logo.

Some  additional credits or dedications,  with bijou dot fx and even  a 
minature dot globe.

The  highlight of the dentro,  lots and lots of Keftales in med/hi res, 
all  different patterns,  and working quite well with the extra  screen 
area.

 Pal_comp ,  is  a loose end,  written for a production that  died  almost 
before  it  was  born.  On the surface,  very old style,  with bouncing 
horizontal raster bars, which do not respect side borders. They carry a 
vintage  looking logo with them,  and a chunky font scroller runs along 
the top.  Underneath,  a not very well hidden part,  'cause they wanted 
everyone  to  see  it,  hidden  screen.  This consists of a  very  full 
fullscreen  plasma  demo,  but with real 4bit Plasma.  To non technical 
people,  this means squillions of colours onscreen,  one figure loosely 
bandied about around the twelve thousand mark?

 Laaaame , a very old screen, written as the front end for the unreleased 
'Great stuff compil 26'.  Mixture of lots of things,  raster bars,  one 
vertical text scroller,  a bouncing logo,  masked by a foreground still 
logo. Also, some digi-sound with a crusty but fun to listen to modfile. 
One  of those screens in the olden days where the coder would say  "And 
even after all of this, I've still got processor time left over!"

 Psg_fullscreen ,  A colourful overscan screen with digidrum music.  Side 
 border rasters and sound indicator bars. Another one to show 'It can be 
done' in those early days.

 Overall, 78% - Impressive for their time.
