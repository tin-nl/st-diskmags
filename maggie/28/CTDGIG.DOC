 
             ˆCRASH TEST DUMMIES - NEW ALBUM AND GIG 
‰
 
Throughout the early years of the Nineties,  popular music took a 
downturn. Real music from the late eighties was replaced by beat, 
followed  by  rave  and dance music,  neither of  which  suit  my 
personal tastes for music that is worth listening to.

But,  accepting the fact that Britpop did a good job in returning 
better quality music to the ears of Brits with the likes of Pulp, 
Blur  and Oasis to name a few of the Britpop bands,  all  of  the 
good  music  that  really is worth listening  to  has  come  from 
overseas.  The US and Canada make up the lions share, but Germany 
also has a hand, as do some other countries.

Back  in the last days of  1989/90,  in  Winnipeg,  Canada,  Brad 
Roberts formed a group called Crash Test Dummies.  Doing  nothing 
much  in  the  early days apart from playing  covers  of  popular 
music,  they  played  pubs and clubs in the area and got  a  fair 
amount of attention, largely due to Brad's famous deep voice.

Fast  forward a couple of years and the Dummies write  their  own 
material,  which would form their first album,  'The Ghosts  that 
Haunt Me'.  One of the best songs here that still stands the test 
of  time  even  now,  and to date has not been  bettered  by  the 
Dummies themselves, is a song called 'Superman's Song'. At around 
the  same time as Brits were treated to Bryan Adams  hogging  the 
charts with his infamous song from Robin Hood,  which meant  that 
we didn't get the song released here.

The  Dummies first came known here with the release of their  new 
top-selling  single in 1994,  the quirkily-named 'MMMM MMMM  MMMM 
MMMM'.  This was followed by one of the albums of that year, 'God 
Shuffled  His  Feet'  - an album which quickly  passed  into  the 
realm  of 'classic' status,  and one which still sounds  good  to 
listen to even today.

The next album,  A Worm's Life,  didn't quite get there for  some 
reason.  Shunned  by  the  music press  here  and  released  very 
quietly,  this album didn't have much in the way of notable songs 
on it but was a fairly good sequel to God Shuffled His Feet.

Fast  forward  to the late stages of 1998 and the early  part  of 
1999,  when  Crash  Test Dummies announced the release  of  their 
fourth album.  Entitled 'Give Yourself A Hand',  this  particular 
album  was released,  once again,  very quietly in the  UK,  much 
later  than  it's release in other  countries.  I  was  fortunate 
enough  to  be  able to get my copy of this album  from  a  music 
dealer in Dresden,  who was promoting the album pretty well, with 
an  excellent standee containing the CDs in a rack.

After  the  return  from EIL in Dresden,  I  began  to  scan  the 
official  Dummies websites for details of the tour that they  had 
started in Canada.  A date was also pencilled in for  London,  on 
June 10th,  so I lost no time in getting a couple of tickets  and 
going  with  a  fellow CTD fan from  my  church,  also  based  in 
Cambridge.

The journey down to the show was pretty uneventful. After a quick 
stop at Tottenham Court Road (with a visit to Computer Exchange), 
it was off to Shepherd's Bush,  to the Empire Theatre there. This 
was  where the CTD show was being held.  Gordon and I managed  to 
find  a nice cafe here,  selling good meals at  Cambridge  prices 
rather than London ones.  We got into the theatre just after 7.30 
pm.

The supporting group were not that long in turning up,  they were 
called  the 'Medieval Babes'.  All dressed in long  red  dresses, 
most of their songs were ok, but two of their best were from that 
hilarious 70's movie, 'The Wicker Man'.

At last,  the real reason why we were there came up. CTD came out 
on the stage - to a loud cheer from the audience. People had been 
coming in since and during the earlier performance,  so the venue 
was  now pretty packed out - but not too packed.  Luckily  Gordon 
and I had got some seats on the top level, so we were able to see 
the Dummies in all their glory.

The famous lead singer of CTD - Brad Roberts - came  on,  dressed 
as a woman, complete with dress. He looked real comical with that 
garb on,  in fact,  he was initialy unrecognisable at first. Then 
the rest of the band came in, including Brad's brother Dan, Ellen 
Reid,  Ben Darvill and Michel Gorge.  They got into their various 
places with the instruments, and began to play the set.

The  first  song was from the new album - Give Yourself  A  Hand. 
Called  'Keep A Lid on Things' - it was instantly  recognised  by 
most of the audience,  who also started to sing along.  CTD  then 
launched  into  some of their classic songs  from  early  albums. 
Their superb hit from 1991, Superman's Song, was also sung, along 
with  MMMM  MMMM  MMMM  MMMM,   God  Shuffled  His  Feet,   Peter 
Pumpkinhead,  I Love Your Goo,  plus many more from all 4 albums. 
For  some  reason,  CTD didn't play anything from A  Worm's  Life 
(their  third album,  after GSHF),  but one of the songs  in  the 
finale was an excellent cover version of Britney Spears'  classic 
(and new at the time) song, Baby One More Time.

Brad addressed the audience most of the time during the set,  and 
one of the things he was pleased to see was the amount of  people 
at  the  gig.  He explained that he (along with the rest  of  the 
band)  were  rather pissed with the handling of Give  Yourself  A 
Hand in the UK by the UK division of Arista,  known as Arista UK. 
He  was  right to feel this way,  because the album  just  simply 
wasn't promoted here at all in the mainstream.  Not even Radio  1 
were  known  to  play any of the new  tracks,  which  was  rather 
strange.  One or two local (to London) independent music stations 
played Keep A Lid On Things - one of these, K97-FM, sponsored the 
gig itself - but in general, it was a very low-key affair.

All  in  all,  it  was fantastic to see  Crash  Test  Dummies  in 
concert.  This,  in fact,  was the first time I had ever seen any 
group live in concert, it was certainly VERY enjoyable. My thanks 
for  getting me interested in CTD in the first place goes  to  my 
cousin from Edmonton,  Canada,  who was also a fan of CTD and had 
seen them play before they became famous.

We managed to get a couple of T-shirts on the way out, which were 
being sold for a fiver each.  Lots of people bought these - well, 
they are pretty rare for such a good band.

My interest in CTD as a band has certainly been strengthened  now 
I  have seen them live.   I shall certainly see them  again  next 
time they play any UK gigs.

Felice.
