
                    ‰The Falcon, a kind of summing up?

 I've  now  had  this computer six years,  which is a long  time  to  be 
spending on any sort of platform. A computer which was the contemporary 
of  a middling 486 PC back in 1993,  must be able to exert some kind of 
strange fascination, to be still on my desktop all this time later? Now 
that  we stand on the brink of the next millenium,  six years is a good 
time to stand back and take a long hard look....
 
Firstly,  the  Falcon  has been unlucky and lucky at the same time,  in 
losing  the support of the parent company that spawned it,  the Tramiel 
dominated Atari Corporation. Unlucky from the point of view that higher 
powered  models  would  have  surely  followed,  an  '040  version  was 
certainly in the works,  and who knows, today, we'd be looking at Power 
PC based systems contemporaneous with current Macintosh technology.  At 
the  same time,  the 'luck' comes from the fact that the  configuration 
has  stayed stable,  and that the users that remained have got to  know 
the hardware really well in the meantime.

I  can't help thinking that if the Falcy had enjoyed a fully  supported 
commercial lifespan,  then it would have gone 'PC' in a way, with newer 
models replacing it wholly or partially within 2 to 3 years?

The  big  question is,  in the six years from the hopeful days  of  its 
launch, has the Falcon really fully reached its potential?

  Games..
 At first sight, not good.

Early  attempts to support the market commercially sort of fizzled  and 
died.  You  may  remember  'Space Junk',  the first wave of  new  style 
adventure games with a 'multimedia' style. (The team that started this, 
went on to produce the heavily hyped but ultimately disappointing 'Rise 
of the Robots' on all the non-Atari formats.) If you remember the early 
Atari sponsored efforts such as 'Llamazap' and '4WD Road Riot', none of 
these had a smooth or early transition to the marketplace,  as they all 
lingered in pre-release hell unduly long,  before some kind third party 
took them over. 

It was only grace and favour style conversions of undemanding PC  games 
such as the 'Ishar' series,  that made it out in the first months.  But 
even  back  then,  really  great things were hinted  at  and  expected, 
especially  from  the  first team of coders daring enough  to  use  the 
fabulous  new 'lightning fast' DSP chip.  In the end,  this did finally 
happen,  but not from the team working on 'Eclipse' (which grew up into 
'Iron Soldier on the Jag!)

A huge round of applause, leading to some sort of standing ovation, has 
to go to the 'Running Development Team' for their dogged persistence in 
producing  their magnificent multi leveled Doom-erama.  A fuller use of 
the  Falcons resources will be hard to find on the game scene!  Further 
waves of enjoyment also derive from the solid base of neat games coming 
from  the hands of the rest of the hobbyist community and  demo  scene. 

Mentioning  Reservoir  Gods  various  productions,  Techno  Ball,  Moon 
Speeder,  Gravon,  Spice,  Lasers and Men,  Crown of Creation,  Killing 
Impact,  and  many  more!  There are still other games even now in  the 
pipeline.  One day may see finished versions of Willies Adventures, the 
ultimate  console-style game,  and Reekin' Rubber.  We may even see the 
odd  genre-gap  filled in,  such as someone to produce a really  decent 
shootemup  in  'Wings of Death style'.  This kind of project  seems  to 
provoke  more half-finished versions than anything?  (X-Moon and Panium 
Disaster.) 

So if we consider games and 'interactive entertainment',  yes, the jury 
has decided that the Falcon has realised its potential in this area.

 In Brief - A big thumbs up, home programmers and scene people responded 
magnificantly where commerce failed.
 

  Graphics..
 The  next area of interest was in the newfangled graphics  capabilities 
of  this  beast.  Back in '93,  we'd all been used to the rather sparse 
options available on the ST or STe. Long before anyone outside of Atari 
Corp,  or  their  inner circle of privileged neophytes had even laid  a 
finger on a Falcon keyboard,  we all drooled at the possibilities.  Not 
knowing  really  what  was there,  but some kind  of  'photo-realistic' 
quality was anticipated.  Nudie GIFs were hoarded with an unholy air of 
anticipation!

The  end  result was a typical Atari fudge/kludge,  with a  half-decent 
VGA-style 256 colour mode, which was good enough to fake it most of the 
time.  The more exciting 'Truecolour 16 bit 'paletteless' mode was even 
better  at first sight,  but suffering an unenviable trade-off  between 
flickery interlace on RGB to get a decent screen size, or something out 
of  a  kiddies paint-box on VGA screens.  Alright,  it was still better 
than  we'd  been  used  to,  and  people  set  about  stretching  these 
possibilities almost from day one.  (But more of that later, as we like 
to repeat ad nauseum!)

Quite an array of new art and image processing software was  announced, 
much  of it GEM-based and also written to use those TT  type  computers 
with add-on graphics cards.  Thinking back, a lot of it was a touch too 
slow  on  the 16 mhz '030 (forget about the DSP,  that only  came  into 
things with the first fast JPEG decoders.)

The  real revolution in Falcon graphics software came,  in my  opinion, 
with  the  release of 'Apex Media'.  A winning combination of a  really 
smart custom interface,  speed and smoothness,  and an amazing array of 
new  tools.  Even the infamous DSP got a good look in with key parts of 
the program! It was also the first to take animation seriously as well. 
Other software following on from the Apex model,  such as Rainbow Paint 
and  Godpaint  were  brave attempts,  but these have their  own  strong 
points, and their own devoted users. More recent software has tended to 
go  back  to the GEM compatible model,  perhaps with an eye to the  new 
generation  of generic TT-like TOS clones,  or those Falcons that  have 
been substantially upgraded.

Animation,  deserves  a separate paragraph of its own,  started slowly, 
with  Brainstorms  early  GEM  foray  into  .FLI  autodesk  animations. 
Remaining  firmly  in the shareware/PD arena,  we started to  see  MPEG 
players  (thanks  to Griff and others),  also some very ropey and  slow 
.AVI  players.   The  most  recent  graduate  has  been  the  excellent 
'Aniplayer',  which  is  very  much  alive today  and  ongoing.  Making 
animations took a big turn for the better with the arrival of 'Neon', a 
truly professional class package (with a professional price tag!)

Missing in action,  is Apex 2,  which would have taken Falcon graphical 
power  onto the next generation.  Designed to be used with the  Nemesis 
hardware  accelerator,   and  working  with  that  elusive  640  x  400 
Truecolour screen mode!

Our  assessment,  got  a long way in a reasonably quick  timespan,  but 
stalled for a bit,  future improvements are still in the pipeline,  but 
may depend on adding additional hardware?

 In Brief - Generally good, but with one or two high profile casualties.  


  Music.. (Maestro Please!)
 Sorry, couldn't resist that one.

If  the Falcon of 1993 hopes and dreams was expected to thrive  in  one 
area,  this was going to be it. The Falcon was created as a peg to hang 
vastly enhanced audio capabilities from it, and as with the graphics, a 
lot was expected from the sound making side of things.

These  were  very  quick  in  arriving.  The  very  first  software  of 
significance  made  use  of  its  nascent  professional  quality  audio 
handling.  A lot was said about Direct-to-disk recording in those early 
days,  and  we even filled up whole partitions with Musicom and  WinRec 
grabbed  audio  tracks in that awkward pause before  much  else  became 
available.  Well,  we  had to do something to impress the sceptical ST-
owning  masses,  and the 256 coloured nudie GIFs on GEM View got a  bit 
stale after a while!

A bit later on,  there came more familiar forms of music making, as the 
first  modfle  players came on the scene.  Griff was in there from  day 
one,  with  a simple player of such clarity,  that it convinced lots of 
non-Falcon  owners that they were hearing stuff in the tunes that  they 
had never heard before!

The  race  was  on for multi-channel heaven.  An  early  contender  was 
Digital Tracker,  which evolved into more and more solid versions,  and 
also  the  more contemporary SoftJee Home Studio series.  The first  to 
flirt with PC style modfile formats,  the gothic nightmare looking Mega 
Tracker,  and  probably  the  most accomplished player of  third  party 
formats to date, Graoumf Tracker. I was going to say that in this area, 
development had gone stale,  but new contenders, such as the innovative 
Flextracker  are  appearing now (otherwise known as what New  Beat  are 
doing in between coding breaks from Willies Adventures!)

And  a lot of people cheered when Cream emulated the  haunting  jingles 
and buzzes of the Commodore 64 Sound Interface Device (SID).  Thousands 
of those sort of tunes made, and most of them playable on the Falcon.

And  you'd thought I'd forgotten things on the professional side,  such 
as Cubase Audio, thought to be *the* killer app for the Falcon, and all 
the rest of it, CD Recording and all. There was always plenty of choice 
for the serious audiophile (Hi Shiuming!) or studio professional. There 
still is.

There may even be a working MP3 player, one day.

For  all  of that,  the voting is split,  as although there was  little 
wrong  with the software,  the hardware tolerances of the Falcon itself 
often let the side down. This was only rectified rather late in the day 
by  C-Lab  taking over production.  The Falcon falls into  a  difficult 
middle  ground,  as it doesn't usually appeal to those music freaks who 
have to own every bit of latest expensive kit,  meaning PC or Mac-based 
studio  hardware,  or  those folk who still want a cheap  and  reliable 
MIDI-box, a case where 'Atari' still means ST!

For the future, watch the Phenix!

 In Brief - A huge range of software, loads to appeal to the amateur and 
professional alike. Professionally speaking, it may have fizzled out in 
this key niche market,  if the current dominance of PCs and Macs is any 
guide. Atari lack of attention to detail may not have helped here?
 

  Utilities.. 
I  can't easily put a 'Falcon' label on these,  as the bulk of what are 
called utilities tend to be GEM-generic,  and the success or failure of 
this  kind of software tends to reflect the wider fortunes of Atari  or 
TOS computers in general.

General  utilites,  tends to be reflected in slow and steady  activity, 
new versions arrived over the years, often with a time-lag whilst being 
translated from the original German!. With operating systems, there was 
quite a bit of interest, with a good hatful of alternatives on offer to 
the functional but limited single-tasking TOS.  Atari's own involvement 
was  swept  under the carpet when they may have been on  the  point  of 
getting  things right?  The earlier version of Multi-TOS had its  fans, 
mainly the sort of people who pay hefty sums of money to be locked in a 
small  cupboard  by a scantily dressed woman of fierce  aspect,  whilst 
wearing nothing but a rubber mask?

Multi-tasking operating systems seem to be mainly in two camps now, the 
MagiC brigade,  versus the 'brew your own' Mint fans. Both fiercely try 
to deny each others existence!

Internet,  this  is  patchy, with heavy,  even frantic activity in some 
places,  such as new connection software versions,  email clients,  IRC 
and  variants,  but  almost stagnant in WWW-browsing.  We will have  to 
check out the Light of Adamas sometime as eff-all seems to be going  on 
in the CAB (Crystal Atari Browser) developers world at this time?

If we're to count in emulation under the utilities banner, oh, alright, 
we will,  then there has been a good deal of activity over the last few 
years.  A  wide,  if  not complete,  range of early 8-bit computers are 
emulated to a high degree, ZX Spectrum, Oric, and TRS80 all take a bow. 
There  was also the sterling work by the Reservoir Gods in  bringing  a 
couple  of  popular  flavours  of Nintendo  to  the  Falcon,  which  is 
definitely something we'd class as 'entertainment'. 

Overall for utilities,  evolution,  rather than revolution,  is the key 
here. The Falcon mainly benefiting from authors long-term commitment to 
improving their products, whatever flavour of GEM/TOS it runs under.

 In  Brief - Reasonable and buoyed up by the general evolution  in  this 
section  on  utilities  for all the TOS machines.
 

  Hardware.. 
There  was a lot of interest in enhancing the Falcon from the  hardware 
side right from the beginning. At the confusing and muddled 'launch' at 
the 1993 16-Bit Show,  I remember seeing prototypes of a genlock (video 
grabber),  an add-on PC board (286-based,  with Windows capability) and 
the first manifestation of 'Screen Blaster',  promising such goodies as 
an extra 800 x 600 pixel 256 colour screen display on the Falcy.

This  never really let up,  from the first relatively crude  'Power-up' 
processor  overclocking kits,  right through to current 50mhz  monsters 
such  as  Centurbo  2,  the '040 based Afterburner  (for  the  *really* 
serious user!) and even a threat of something with a Power PC chip from 
Istari  for  the  near future.  Quite a lot of people in  their  Falcon 
owning  lifetimes  have  been bitten by a hardware add-on  bug.  If  we 
consider our little circle,  myself,  Mr Pink,  and Matt Smith have all 
got  Nemesis  (a cheap but interesting  overclock  style  accelerator), 
Felice went and added the rather nice 'Expose' digitiser to his  Falcy. 
As  you're  all tediously aware by now,  I've got another machine  with 
Centurbo 2 under the case.

Taking  in  a  whole bunch of gadgets,  replacement  cases,  DSP  audio 
widgets,  and at the more straightforward end of the scale, more memory 
and   bigger  hard  drives,   then  the  Falcon  has  kept  abreast  of 
developments in the wider world more than adequately.

Don't forget,  the beauty of this system is, that it can still run over 
90%  of  the  software  ever written for it even  when  it  is  totally 
unmodified, and still dressed in its 1993 clothes!

 In  Brief  -  A  roaring  success,  but  this  makes  you  wonder  what 
deficiencies needed addressing in the first place? 
 

  Demos..
 This was always an area of major interest and keen anticipation for the 
Maggie Team, especially when the machine was first released.

Happily,  our  hopes  were soon realised with the early arrival of  the 
'Terminal  Fuck Up' demo ('Termfin' to polite society!) by Sanity,  who 
must have been on an away-day from the Amiga?

Things never really looked back from there, the highlights you all well 
and  truly know by now,  but surely would include just about everything 
by EKO, Lazer's two big Fried Bits stoppers in '94 and '95, 'Sono, from 
Tat/Avena  in  1997,  Dead Hackers 'full demo into 4k' at  Orneta  '97, 
Senior Dads? There are too many to mention in full, but this is another 
area where the Falcon surely reached its potential.

But has it peaked? You ask, have the best times gone by?

In answer to that, we are still awaiting the next 'big thing', the demo 
that will beat 'Sono'.  Lots of people are getting close.  Also, if you 
consider the recent revival of the ST,  and this is a platform which is 
supposed  to be 8-10 years past its peak,  then there should still be a 
lot more to come from the Falcy in the future! 

 In Brief - A huge amount of material over the years. May it continue!  
 

 That Elusive Killer App?
 This area is a lot harder to follow.  There were some interesting,  nay 
unique  products  promised back in 1993.  We never got to see  the  DSP 
modem,  and we're still waiting on the 'General Synthesiser', otherwise 
known  as 'Falcon as musical instrument',  efforts by Griff and Sentry, 
but these seem to have gone into the big pending tray in the sky.

There  were  also some frankly strange ideas inspired  by  Atari  Corps 
vision  of  the  Falcon as a 'multimedia' machine.  Who  remembers  the 
'intelligent answerphone',  an oddity that was going to use the heavily 
trumpeted audio capabilities of the Falcon.

The idea that the Falcon was going to do something 'unique' that  other 
computers couldn't,  never survived those early heady days.  Everything 
we've  discussed  before  has  been seen on  other  computers  in  some 
(usually Windows-shaped) form. It seems that the Falcon tends to run to 
a 'me too' tendency, albeit with a huge dose of individuality that this 
small but inspired scene provides.

There  is  a hefty consolation prize for those people  who  stayed  the 
course  right until the end.  The 'Whip' sound-to-light program is  one 
piece of multimedia magic eminently suited to the Falcon. Not something 
to  sell Falcons on their own to a sceptical PC public,  but  certainly 
something good enough to make them want to take a closer look.
 
 In Brief - The area which died away the quickest. Shame about the DSP
modem though!
 

Conclusions..
 So,  has  the  Falcon turned out to be a red-hot roaring success,  or a 
squalid squib of failure?

If  you  set it against the fortunes of the wider  market,  which  only 
really  adds up to Bill Gates trousering the odd extra billion  dollars 
or  so after cornering yet another market,  Atari seem to have lost the 
plot  very  early  on,  and seemed to want to forget the  machine  ever 
happened.

But  if you set it against the many dedicated and creative  people  who 
came  to the platform,  and who wouldn't lie down and die,  then it has 
succeeded against all expectations!  (alright, lots of people have laid 
down  and  died,  but usually after leaving something brilliant on  the 
way.)

The last six years have really been the greatest!
