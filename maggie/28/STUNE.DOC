In view of the recent and growing popularity of generic high-spec Atari 
TOS  clones,  such  as  the  Milan,it  isn't  too  surprising  that  an 
increasing  number of games releases are catering for  those  GEM-legal 
fans  with  a  requirement to be able to run them  without  any  system 
specific hassles.

In this spirit, STune is being developed, as a strategy game, a kind of 
Cannon Fodder/Civilisation hybrid, as it were.

Taken  from the PC strategy game 'Dune 2',  this was brought to us by a 
mixed team, from Spion of Escape doing the graphics, and doing the code 
are Sokrates and Thothy.

The  plot  has you doing battle with the evil forces  of  the  Microsap 
Empire,  to  save your home planet of Aratis,  (do you spot some slight 
name-altering  based  humour  here?)  The action  takes  place  over  a 
sizeable  game map,  and you start off with a small number of  military 
units, and a single building.

With  this expeditionary force of limited means,  you have to build  up 
the  size  and  quality of your units,  also raising  and  selling  off 
buildings to boost the cash required,  to purchase more troops. (All of 
them mercenaries,  whatever happened to idealistic young people joining 
up to 'fight the good fight'?!)  Answer:- they saw sense! 

Of  course,  these attempts to gain ground and consolidate haven't gone 
unnoticed by the minions of the Microsoft,  ahem,  Microsap empire, and 
almost immediately,  they counter-attack, flinging their pitiful kevlar 
clad hordes against your armoured might.  Of course,  if you aren't too 
sharp on rebuilding the damaged bits of your domain,  all these attacks 
will  eventually wear you down.  So it's quite a lot like how Microsoft 
works in real life, then.

Game  control is divided into two parts,  there is a central  'resource 
management'  section,  where you build up your forces,  check your bank 
balance,  that kind of thing.  Then there is also the tactical section, 
where you point and click for your forces to go to.

The  Cannon Fodder analogy starts to break down at this point,  as  you 
don't  have  any arcade-based influence over the outcome of  a  battle, 
just depends what forces you cunningly positioned, and how overwhelming 
they are in relation to the enemy.

Of course, you could play this in a totally self-indulgent fashion, and 
decide to go off and explore the unknown dark portions of the map,  but 
you might well be on a fast-track to oblivion by doing this?

Graphically,  it works quite well,  with an overhead viewpoint, looking 
functional,  and  with  better graphics to follow.  General game  speed 
seems to be good,  and there is more than enough there on a Centurbo 2, 
as  it  is written for something like a standard Falcon  '030  upwards. 
Well,  maybe strictly not a Falcon, but a 16 mhz cpu up is recommended, 
according to the authors own .readme text.

There  are  nice  touches,  such as an add-on soundpack,  with lots  of 
suitably warlike sound effects, for those DMA replay capable computers, 
and  even a modfile for background music fans (which can be changed  by 
renaming  your  own  favourite  modfile and  putting  it  in  the  same 
directory.)

This is still only a preview version,  the graphics are described as in 
a pre-release state, and the enemy artificial intelligence is described 
as 'not too clever'.  However,  what is already here,  is potentially a 
gripping GEM of a worthy brain game!
