
                            ‰The Maggie Team!
 
                Is the Mitrokhin Archive an LZH or what?

 Summertime,  and the spies are humming! With just about everyone over a 
certain  age in Western Europe being sussed as a possible  contact  for 
the KGB/STASI, we break open some recently declassified secret stuff to 
see if the finger is pointing at key members of the Maggie Team.

Yep, it is!

  CiH... 
The  'main  man'  in this dubious enterprise.  Has written  openly  and 
unashamedly  for this publication on every possible occasion.  Has also 
had links with other subversive organisations such as 'ST News', 'Power 
Magazine',  and even the notorious Hollis faction behind 'ST Plus'.  Is 
also  believed  to  have  enjoyed  large  cornish  pasties  on  several 
occasions.... Conclusion, MAN OF INFLUENCE!

  Mr Pink...
 The  equally infamous 'no 2 in charge'.  A slippery character hiding  a 
broad  range  of covert activities behind a bunch  of  unlikely  famous 
Footballer/Scottish  folk-rock  cross genre  band/left  wing  political 
figure inspired pseudonyms. Was only just stopped from inflicting issue 
three  of 'HP Source' by our black ops department.  Now active in  'The 
Industry'.... Conclusion, MAN DEVELOPING PLAYSTATION 2 STUFF!

  Jody Smith...  
Has  been  getting dangerously close to several of  our  most  reliable 
long-term academic 'sleeper' agents,  by outsleeping most of them up to 
three in the afternoon or later.  Weird but innocuous appearance belies 
his  most  disruptive activites which take place  under  'Blue  Monkey' 
codename.  These are telephonic based,  and blatantly stick two fingers 
up  at  our  bugging/phonetap  attempts  by  openly  printing  out  the 
conversation transcripts.... Conclusion, MAN OF INFLUENZA?

  Sh3... 
Since  the  Berlin  Wall was pulled down,  this person hasn't  had  the 
ability  to  do  any  more  graffiti on it.  He has  made  do  with  an 
Atari/Godpaint  combination since.  Rather quiet apart from  occasional 
reports of hardware death....  Conclusion, MAN OF ELECTRONIC PAINTS!

  MSG....
 His accent is a known CIA agent,  implicated in saying "Heey!" a lot in 
the Dresden area,  and encouraging others to do the same.  This was not 
stopped at any time,  why not?.... Conclusion, MAN WITH LARGE VOICE AND 
LARGER TROUSERS?

  Ripley...
 We  had  high hopes when she initially got a place  at  Cambridge,  but 
disappointed  as  found  to  be totally  unsuitable  to  become  effete 
Stalinist upper-class MI5 double agent moulded in the image of Burgess, 
Maclean,   etc.   Also   said  something  about  too  much  coursework? 
Conclusion, WOMAN WITH TOO MUCH ON AT THE MOMENT! (SLEEPIN6?)

  Taff.... 
Our most successful Welsh operative,  now busy in MILAN! Has no problem 
lurking near clean water supplies....  Conclusion,  MAN WITH SHAKY GRIP 
ON SPELLING AND GRAMMAR!

  Felice....
 Still  doesn't  realise that sex sells.  Also known as the 'Butcher  of 
East  Cheam'.  Notorious  for  volunteering  collegues  for  tasks  and 
forgetting  to  tell them (esp.  CiH!) Can remember two things  out  of 
three that you tell him to do.... Conclusion, MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE HE HAS 
LOST A TENNER AND FOUND A PENNY!

  Matt Smith... .
Code-named  'Scooby  Doo'.  Disperses subersive computer  equipment  at 
computer  shows  from prominent 'Mystery Mobile'  camper  van,  Invites 
people of all ages into his 'Shack'... Conclusion, BE VERY WORRIED!

  Requiem....
 A codename for a nocturnally active sonic weapon,  tested on several of 
above  Maggie  Team  members whilst in Dresden  last  Easter.  Symptoms 
include  tiredness,  irritability,  mass  shoutings  of "Heey!",  burst 
Mullerice  pots,  and  loosened  bowels....  Conclusion,  MAN WHO  GOES 
'ZZZzGRUNKLBLAART' A LOT!

  John Hayward....
 Known  appetites include ripping apart old electronics,  computer gear, 
bugging  device  etc,  and reassembling them in more profitable  forms. 
Part  of the 'WAG' dad-front.  Admitted interest in precocious American 
child battery farming techniques.  Otherwise blameless,  if you care to 
believe that? Conclusion, MAN WITH CONSTANTLY TWITCHING SOLDERING IRON!
 

Thanks  also  left  in a hollow tree stump in  Epping  Forest  for  the 
following..
 
George Nakos,  A very large 'big-up' to you, our first contact, in fact 
 anyone's  first contact with the nascent Greek Atari scene?

Sander Berents, for getting back in touch with me with some useful info 
for the Tandy '2nd Life' emulator review.

Chris Crosskey,  who has to bear a large part of the responsibility for 
the internet-based jokes in the last couple of issues of Maggie.

Shiuming Lai and System Solutions, for being generally very helpful.

Craig Charles of 'Red Dwarf' fame,  for giving his time to Jody for the 
special celebrity interview.

Atari Computing, for doing their best.

Q-Funk for his NAS report, so there is life after ALT?

NUT for his interview.

Havoc for his too.  

 Mario Becroft for his brilliant cover pic. The original can be found on 
gem.win.co.nz/mario/graphics/

There are a whole bunch of other nice Pov-rendered piccies he has done, 
why  not check them out too?  The rather curious greyscale/purple  haze 
scene on the ST menu is down to me, I accept full responsibility. It is 
done according to the STe palette,  so might look slightly different on 
an 'FM.

Respect is also due for his (three!) entries to the MagiC Games Contest 
too. Well done for 'Orb winning first prize!

Steve  Moore  for his cool tune for the Falcon Maggie,  which has  been 
hanging around,  waiting to be used for a few issues now! Thanks Steve, 
you  finally  got your turn.  I like to lay some claim to ownership  of 
this  tune,  as  it was originally a four channel modfile that he  did, 
uprated  and  fattened into eight channels on my  Falcon,  via  Graoumf 
Tracker  in his first session with this program.  The end result  isn't 
too shabby, I'm sure you'll agree.

The  audio side of things on the ST version has been taken care  of  by 
MSG with an even older soundchip tune!

The  'Newsdesk' pages were helped by a whole bunch of folks,  they  get 
their own separate thanks and credits on there.


 Greetings, in order of faulty brain recalling them.. 

All people organising the EIL Party,  it was the greatest! Good luck to 
the Millenium Party people!

Grey/Mystic Bytes,  EVL, the new Undercover Team, with many of the same 
people,  go for it ST Survivor!  Cobra for valiant 3-D stuff, TNB/Stax, 
for  being  top room-mates at EIL,  esp FXL.  (Pause for hastily gasped 
breath  inwards)  Earx/FUN,  Cream,  we want new music player,  we want 
'Heftig!' Nature,  we want new games dammit!  (Eric Cartman voice.) New 
Beat,  Tat,  who  is  still missed,  but no point crying over spilt milk 
etc. Baggio, Amigo Pizza, (Funny how I put those two together, eh!) 

New paragraph now,  oooh! Richard Karsmakers, who is now married, haha, 
no  going  back  on that one matey!  STNICC 2000  creeps  ever  closer. 
Centek, Phenix due real soon now at the *SNIP!* Nicky, we had some good 
times together,  Frankie the monster-sized cat. Ed Cleveland we haven't 
forgotten  you!  Ibiza,  or  Eivissa in the local dialect,  or 'Ibitza', 
according  to  the Venga Boys.  It doesn't just have clubs it has  real 
unspoilt beaches and stuff as well! 

And anyone I forgot, which will be quite a lot of people.

See you next time.

 CiH -  '99
