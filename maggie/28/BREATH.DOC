                           By the Mystic Bytes 

 A  debut  on the ST,  for fiercely pro-Falcon group Mystic Bytes.  Just 
when  the  ST was the height of fashion,  for all sorts of people.  Old 
timers coming back with ancient and justified source code rewarmed, new 
people  with  emulators,  trying their luck,  and a bunch of new design 
ideas.  Even  established crews on the later bird of prey styled  Atari 
wanted to be in on the action.  So it is, that The Mystic Bytes, jumped 
in on the ST.
 
Actually, as with a lot of the newer productions, it is pretty free and 
easy  about what sort of hardware it can run on.  A Falcon presents  it 
with  no problem,  the only 'compulsory' requirement being 1 MB of  RAM 
for  whatever  machine you use.  That said,  it didn't fancy CT2  mode, 
crashing/sticking  on the first 'Let's Buggin' screen,  and really runs 
on the quick side on even a standard 16mhz '030 Falcy .
   
 Where  were  we?  'Let's Buggin!',  and the Tao begins to play,  a bassy 
growling  sort  of  SID tune.  Straight into the first still  piccy,  a 
heavily  metallic skull,  the eyes and mouth glowing with an  unearthly 
light. First effect soon follows, a sort of double-axis texture tunnel, 
the  texture  reminiscent  of the 'streaky bacon' effect  seen  in  the 
Jaguar game 'Tempest 2000'. This is very quick on 16mhz, an interesting 
trick  is  used  to  keep the speed up.  This is to  not  display  each 
alternative  line  on screen,  to keep the speed and screen  resolution 
good.  An  interesting trick that also enhances the 'look' onscreen  as 
well.

The  title  of  the demo is next,  another still graphic,  a  bunch  of 
twisted  abstract  letters in a French scener style,  maybe this  is  a 
little bit rushed looking and needed a couple more colours?

It's tunnels again,  this one is textured,  and forever tilts away from 
the  viewer,  as  if he is stuck in a loop.  One of the more  memorable 
pictures follows,  an ecologically aware 'Fuji-tree stump' picture,  as 
if  to comment on the sad death of Atari,  and the rain forests at  the 
same  time?   (True story about this,  at least one person at EIL didn't  
 spot the Fuji part, "I thought it was just a tree stump." 

You can never really get away from them in any demo, and this one is no 
exception.  The  greets  come next,  but in a neat six-sided distorting 
framework, which looks like the ever-changing petals on a flower! 

A  total  change  of mood next,  clearly an effect  that  was  designed 
separately  from the rest,  a cool-looking vector/neon vortex fills the 
screen.  Sort  of  reminds me of those old sci-fi movies "Look  at  the 
scanner,  we're  being sucked into the black hole captain,  and there's 
nothing we can do!"

Back  to greets,  and a 'streaky bacon' distorter is the background  to 
the second half of their salutations to the rest of the Atari Scene.

Pause for a moment, tasteful picture, and poetry appears, line by line, 
just to stop your brain overheating?

A little rotate and zoom,  albeit, this is a whole screen doing it, not 
one  of those early demos which split a picture into dozens  of  little 
copies of itself.  This is soon followed by a split screen effect, with 
two  different  kinds of distorters,  one a sort of tunnel,  the other, 
a variant on the streaky bacon plasma seen a bit earlier,  running side 
by side. Just to show off the coders skills!

A  ripply wave-like plasma travels from one side of the screen  to  the 
other, then it is time for a bit of classic bump-mapping, with an 'TMB' 
logo fitfully illuminated, according to wherever the light-source goes.

A  final  'girlfriend  from  hell'(could  that  be  Alannis   Morisette 
inspiring  it?!)  picture just squeezes in ahead of the  final  effect. 
This  is a very long texture tunnel,  with it's farpoint a long way  in 
the  distance.  At  the bottom of the screen,  the dread letters,  'The 
End'.   And I'm sure I've missed out a couple of still pictures in there 
somewhere?
 
This  is clearly an inspired move on the part of Mystic Bytes,  to  try 
something  new.  There is nothing really innovative from previous demos 
on the Falcon,  apart from getting Falcon type effects to run on an ST. 
This is also something that could be said of the Dead Hackers ST  entry 
to  Error  in Line,  'Sweety'.  In fact,  the two demos have an overall 
'look'  and  'feel' that are very similar to one  another!  Spooky,  or 
what! I would also say that the presentation and execution of this demo 
is  as  smooth and sweet as we would expect.  The rawness from  earlier 
productions has now totally disappeared. 

We have very high hopes for their next generation of new demos!
 
Ratings..

Effects:-  78%  -  Well presented modern effects.  A little too  'samey' 
(tunnels) in places.
 
Graphics:- 84% -  Polished look, and several nice piccies from the hands 
of ST Survivor. Good consistent style maintained throughout.
 
Sound:- 82% -  Top tune from Tao! 

Overall:- 81% -  Good ST debut effort.
