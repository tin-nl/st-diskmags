               A Demo for the ST by  Dead Hackers Society
 
These  were  not the only predominantly Falcon only crew to  release  a 
demo  for the ST at Error in Line,  you may already recall Mystic Bytes 
getting up to something very similar. You also recall DHS doing the odd 
ST or STe demo, 'way back when', in the early-mid nineties, before they 
became  what  they  are  today.  So is this a case  of  taking  up  the 
challenge of adapting their Falcon classics to the earlier platform, or 
is it a case of returning to their roots?

We'll take a closer look at the demo and decide from there!

Checking out the 'readme' file,  we are told that this demo is generous 
and open-minded as to what it will run on. Anything from a humble 8 mhz 
ST,  through  to loftier hardware,  such as TT or CT2 enhanced Falcons, 
with add-on operating systems such as MinT/MagiC,  and screen expanders 
all in place! The only thing it asks back from the user, is a minimum 2 
MB of memory,  which may well rule out a lot of machines at the humbler 
end of the market after all?

Still,  boot up the demo,  and instant brand identification is provided 
via a 'fire and ice' style DHS logo,  an MC Laser tune starts up at the 
 same time.  A neat little bunch of credits appear next, to tell you who 
did what, so we learn that Edo was responsible for the static graphical 
niceness in this demo, and apart from MC Laser's tonal offering, DMA-SC 
gets in on the end credits with a tune of his own.

The first proper effect seems to be a take on the opening part of their 
ATS  Falcon  entry,  with a triple axis flying  blob/starburst  effect, 
which swaps palettes around,  so they become black holes for a bit, and 
change back to a greeny palette. 

First  piccy,  a cutesty-floppy bunny 'wabbit,  reminiscent of that EXA 
demo piccy (or the Gloop demo effort!)

A   chunky  texture  tunnel  follows,   which  splits  into  a  double, 
independently  moving  axis/farpoint ,  which is then overlaid over  a, 
what is to be shortly shown in its full glory, Static Lakeside piccy.

A break from tunnels in this midpoint section of the demo,  reminiscent 
of  the same effect done on the Mystic Bytes 'Breath' ST demo.  This is 
bumpmapping,  again,  done  over  a  large  lettering  logo  ('DHS'  of 
course!),  and  also  with a blue-white background.  This differs  from 
Mystic Bytes,  by going for a chunkier resolution,  but not missing out 
alternate lines off the display.  Very little to chose between the two, 
at the end of the day.

The first of two gorgeous Edo drawn pictures comes up. This is a female 
portrait  profile  set  by a lakescape sunrise/sunset,  and  looks  the 
business!

A  small  effect,  recycled from a 4k demo,  and a bugger to  describe, 
follows after,  this is some sort of rotating texture,  which goes back 
into itself, as if being looked at through a prism or distorting lense, 
and comes out again. This is only a prequel for what comes next.

This  is one of the technical or coding highlights of the demo,  a nigh 
on  perfect version of the DHS classic bump-textured tunnel,  shown  to 
such  powerful  effect in such Falcon demos as the '4Ever'  4ktro,  and 
 'Dream  Dimension'.   Considering  the  original  needed  a  maths  co-
processor,  the  only  clue  to  how this was done here,  is  a  little 
something in the credits 'FPU pre-calculation by Gizmo'!  Again,  a bit 
chunkier in the pixel department, but full marks for doing this here!

Another  lesser spinning and distorting tunnel follows up next,  before 
giving away to the best set-piece still piccy,  a Japanese babe,  which 
is obviously done in the full 4096 colour palette available on the  STE 
and above (interlaced colours for STFM series.)

The  final  major effect,  is yet another tunnel,  but this one with  a 
flickering  light source,  as if a gap kept opening momentarily at  the 
tunnel end!

The  end  credits are a treat too,  as MC Laser's excellent  tune  dies 
away,  and  replaced  by  an upbeat DMA-SC effort to usher in  the  end 
credit  text.  On  the  right hand side,  another tasty sixteen  colour 
piccy,  on the left,  a pre-rendered twisting 'DHS' logo,  and the text 
overlaid on the foreground screen going up.

My  earlier  question  about what this demo was  supposed  to  be,  was 
answered.  Most  definitely an assured conversion of previously 'Falcon 
only' effects to the ST!  Also,  like their Falcon 'ATS' entry, and the 
Mystic  Bytes 'Breath' demo,  showing the need for a new generation  of 
effects  to  make  their presence felt,  the faithful  texture  tunnel, 
having  ever least drop of novelty and innovation finally drawn out  of 
it by the EIL entries.

 Ratings... 

 Effects:-  82%  - Reworkings of previous Falcon effects.  A  technically 
strong Bump-texture tunnel is noteworthy.

 Graphics:- 88% -  Ace still graphics from Edo, Japgirl piccy to die for!

 Sound:- 82% -  Two top SID tunes from ace sound men MC Laser and DMA-SC.

 Overall:- 84%  - Smart and professional conversion of famous DHS  Falcon 
effects.
