 Reuters, Paris, 

The  official  enquiry into the cause of the fatal crash  which  killed 
Diana,  Princess of Wales,  Dodi Fayed,  and Henri Paul, the driver has 
closed.  The  cause of the accident can be revealed as a combination of 
factors involving Henri Paul being distracted at the crucial moment, by 
reading the 'Build your own Jaguar Team Tap' article in a recent  issue 
of Atari Computing.

Hopes  that the conclusion of the official enquiry would put an end  to 
the  wild speculation surrounding the accident and its  aftermath  were 
dashed,  when  Al  Fayed announced that incriminating traces  of  Amiga 
Format had been secretly removed from the wreckage by MI5!


 Basildon Echo, nowhere near Paris, 

Local resident,  Arnold Sprogget, got a lot more than he bargained for, 
when he was searching fields at the bottom of Millpond Lane for  buried 
Roman  treasure.  Instead,  his metal detector chanced upon a long-lost 
and partially rusted ST Replay cartridge buried just above the surface. 
The find has been declared 'treasure trove' by the government.

 The  ALTernative  Party,  episode 2,  closed today.  The 'computer which 
most  resembles  its owner' competition,  had a surprise winner in  the 
form of a custom-built Amiga, that was shaped like an arse.

An  obscure state by-law reveals it is illegal to boot-load NVDI  on  a 
Sunday, if within one hundred yards of church premises!

Also,  same-sex marriages for carp are very much frowned upon. The last 
such unholy union was put to the flames in 1834, and served with chips, 
it was (reportedly) delicious.

A  bootleg  version of the popular ST game 'Wings of Death',  has  been 
reissued  with  slightly modified title graphics,  and  a  retranslated 
name. It is now known as "Child hero of the Revolution in Death Minor!"

This  month's  'Fascist Playmate of the month',  General Pinochet,  was 
interviewed in a superficial and fawning fashion, by an over-respectful 
Trenton  Webb,  a  former  editor of 'ST Format'.  Readers get  various 
insights  into  the ex-Chilean dictators love of  peaches,  and  strong 
preferences  for natural wood work surfaces.  Not to mention his future 
hopes for part-time employment at a local call-centre helping  disabled 
people to colour coordinate their kitchens!

 A  Burundi  Air internal flight was delayed for three hours  and  might 
never have taken off, until a goat came forward to act as the co-pilot. 

The goats owner, Joshua Nbele said "He is very intelligent goat, and it 
will be a shame for my family to have to kill and eat him.  But by Gods 
command, we have no other choice!"


 Felice "It's really true, honest!" movie trivia facts, somewhere? 

A  copy  of  issue nine of Atari Computing can be seen  on  the  summer 
blockbuster 'Wild Wild West'!

It can be seen on the left hand side of the shot, just as Will Smith is 
jumping  over  the side of the giant mechanical  spider  with  Chucky's 
Bride in hot pursuit!
