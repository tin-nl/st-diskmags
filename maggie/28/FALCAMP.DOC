"It works on a standard Falcon? That's cool, you need at least a 100mhz 
Pentium to play MP3's on a PC!" - John Hayward,  suitably impressed, as 
he should be, of course..
 
It's an MP3 player for the Falcon!! At last!! And it really works!!

Sorry about so much expression of jubilation so early in a review,  but 
it  isn't  every  day  that you get access to  a  new  form  of  media, 
especially  when  you've  been  told  that  this  should  be  basically 
impossible.

MP3,  or to give it its boring name,  MPEG layer 3 audio,  has gained a 
very  wide acceptance in the (Wintel/Mac) community at large.  This has 
become  the  format of choice for transporting music files  around  the 
internet.  Everyone  from long established acts (why do I keep thinking 
of David Bowie?!) to up and coming talent,  all choose MP3.  It is also 
the  current  choice of music pirates,  and even those clearer  sighted 
distributors  who  want their piece of the action.  I've  even  started 
seeing  MP3  players in hi-fi magazines,  and portable MP3 players  may 
well  displace  the Walkman as the go-anywhere format  of  choice  real 
soon now.

A  new  factoid/urban myth about the internet is  currently  doing  the 
rounds,  'Sex' no longer is the main keyword typed into search engines, 
the new favourite word is now 'MP3!'

With  all  of this going on around our heads,  then the arrival of  the 
first MP3 player runnable on a Falcon, couldn't have been more timely!

FalcAMP 0.8 is a beta,  the authors are at pains to point this out.  It 
also  is very simple and compact at this point in time,  coming in at a 
mere  77  kilobytes.  We can imagine that a PC equivalent will come  in 
many times larger.

The  user  interface  is sort of non-existent at this  point  in  time, 
consisting  of a TTP command line,  with the rather more sensible 'drag 
'n  drop' featuring strongly too.  You can see this as a  half-finished 
early Xmas present,  as there is a lot more to do,  not least, adding a 
proper GEM interface,  and according to the authors, further debugging, 
refinement  of the DSP side,  and further optimisation to allow  stereo 
replay on a standard (16mhz) Falcon.

The key to all of this,  is not how it looks,  but what it sounds like, 
and  a  preliminary examination of some MP3's cribbed  off  a  Computer 
Shopper coverdisk CD-ROM (November 1999), realised all my hopes in that 
direction.

On  a 50mhz (and 50mhz DSP) Centurbo 2 accelerated Falcy,  the  results 
were  sensational!  CD-quality replay (interpolated to work with  Falcy 
replay  rates,  it  sounded  brilliant,  even  in mono!  And  this  ran 
comfortably from a screen mode of 800 x 598 in 256 colours.

On  a  standard  Falcon,  it worked just as fine,  with a tendency  for 
stuttering/skipping replay when the system was under load on one or two 
or  the  more  intense tunes.  This may also have been due  to  another 
factor, discussed immediately below.

It mostly managed to cope with my ancient NEC SCSI double-speed CD-ROM, 
playing  'on the fly'.  Retrospectively,  and trying the CD in question  
with  the  MP3-capable  Aniplayer  2.08,  suggests that  this  item  of 
hardware  may have been a little slow in places.  An option to cache  a 
whole  song to memory,  for those of us with stupid amounts of FastRAM, 
may  be  a good idea for a future version of FalcAMP? (Aniplayer  does 
this already.) Or just copy and run from a hard drive.

It does work under multi-tasking systems,  just about,  as under MagiC, 
it  forces VT52 running.  When I first tried it out under MagiC,  there 
was  a  nasty hangup on the DSP when quitting,  but this didn't  happen 
again.  You  can multitask if you really have to,  but there is so much 
distortion  and  jumping,  it isn't such a good idea.  (To be fair, the 
same problem affects v2.08 of Aniplayer,  in fact,  the only MPEG audio 
file  player  that doesn't clash with the system,  was the  NoCrew  MP2 
player, which didn't even seem to put any significant load on it?

For such a tiny program,  it does a brilliant job, and the next version 
release  from  Sector  One with a full GEM  interface  etc,  is  keenly 
awaited!  It will be interesting to see how this compares with the MP3-
able version 2.08, and future releases, of Aniplayer.

What the finished product promises to be,  will be very exciting,  what 
we've got now, is scarcely less so!

 Version 0.92 is released, which has DSP interrupt sorted, so it is able 
to  operate  smoothly within a  multi-tasking  environment.  Definitely 
comes out as an efficient little MP3 engine now!
