                           ‰Out on the Sith...
 
A  diverse  collection  of impressions gathered from  the  new  Phantom 
Menace film.

 George  Lucas  is  back,   the  bearded  and  slightly  chubby  looking 
billionaire  who hasn't done a stroke of real work since  the  original 
Star Wars movie in 1977,  opted to plonk  himself down in the directors 
chair  for  this one.  Critical reaction has  been less than kind,  the 
most  restrained critics comparing the new film  directly with a  great 
steaming pile of Ewok poo. Cinema audiences seem  to disagree, with box 
office records being broken, and more bullion heaping itself  on top of 
the George Lucas money mountain.

Still,  it's our opinion that counts here,  as this random selection of 
impressions from the new film will prove!

                          ----v----

Firstly,  it  is  *not*  the worst ever Star Wars derived  movie.  That 
dishonour  belongs  to  the  Ewok world  based  spin-off  movie,  which 
followed  the first three,  This really was a rancid steaming  week-old  
pile of Ewok poo.  Blantantly cheap, blatantly a kiddies film, clumsily  
trying to milk their emotions to make them blub in a crude facsimile of 
the  Bambi's mother death scene.  Memory erases itself as to the reason 
why  I   saw  this.  But I would say that for all its  faults,  Phantom 
Menace is  nowhere near as dire!

                           ----v----

There  was  a  counter-attack  from the  Lucas  camp  on  the  critical 
reaction.  Critics  in  this  kind of mega-production  were  considered  
irrelevant, like (real) estate agents, an irritation. This is one issue  
where  I would take sides with the critics,  as the Lucas-ites seem  to 
think  they are above and beyond mere earthly  criticism.  Overwhelming  
hugeness  and hype do not make a production good on their own.  You may  
well  take  Microsoft  as an example of how things can go  bad  if  the 
people  at the top assume they are immune to criticism.  Laziness,  and  
with a worst case scenario, active contempt for the audience creeps in.
                               
                            ----v----

Phantom  Menace was careless with character development.  We saw a  lot 
more  of  Darth Maul,  the principal villain,  on promotional material,  
Rice Crispies packets,  etc, than we did in the film. Lurks about a bit  
on Tatooine, a fight sequence a bit later on, blam! and gone.... Not so  
much a walk-on part, but more a carried off feet first part? 

This  was probably the most offhand and dismissive use of  a  principal 
character  ever  seen  in motion picture  history.  What's  the  matter 
George, don't you like the guy?

                            ----v----

Jar  Jar  Binks,  WHY?!  "Me  comic  relief,  me pointless  and  stupid 
character!  Me  designed  to make sales of bendy stretchy  rubber  toys 
possible!" George  Lucas should get down on his knees and apologise  to 
the world for this  rubbery abomination!
                    
                             ----v----

I  felt that too much of the film hung on the precocious nine year  old 
Darth Vader, erm sorry, Anakin Skywalker. The Force is doubtless strong  
within him, even at this early stage, but so much of what he did looked  
like lucky accidents.  Press this button, fire those torpedoes, hit the 
conveniently placed central reactor core of the bad guys ship, the end.  

Yoda  thought  that fear was strong within Anakin,  but it looked  more 
like  he  was missing his Playstation?  We look forward to episodes two 
and three,  where we'll see more of the essential Darth coming through!

                             ----v----

What  Jedi goes anywhere without a sensible money-belt,  with which  to 
pay  the  galactic equivalent of the Automobile Association  (AA)  when  
their  hyperdrive  breaks down.  Having to get a nine year old  boy  to  
scrape up the readies for them is frankly, a bit demeaning.

                              ----v----

The action was quite sparse,  and the film sagged in the middle.  A lot 
of  this  was down to the workload imposed by introducing some  of  the 
principal  characters  for  the rest of the films.  It seemed like  the 
Tatooine  pod-race  was  grafted  in to break up  the  boredom?  It  is 
interesting  to  look back at the two minute 'taster' which  was  shown 
earlier  this year,  which implied a lot  more pace and urgency in  its 
direction, than was found in the finished product. Maybe George Lucas's 
real genius is in making commercials?

                               ----v----

The  Naboo  royal starship looked intensely familiar.  Like the  design 
consultants  had  been  to a distant planet in  another  galaxy  called 
'Lockheed' and asked for something "A lot like your SR71 Blackbird, but  
with a bit more of a Silver Dream Machine motif to it!"

Okay, so I liked that one!

                               ----v----

So let the bad guys robot army be controlled by a bunch of servers  all 
located  in the one place,  which can be compromised by a nine year old 
in a hotwired rocket ship, breaking and entering the docking bay?

- DOH!

                                ----v----

In  the end,  the film suffers from being pulled in too many  different 
directions at once. It has a lot of work to do in setting the scene for  
the  rest  of  tale.  There  seems to be an attempt  to  graft  on  the 
structure of the original (episode 3) film, with an explosive climax at  
the end,  but  once you've seen the Death Star explode,  well,  nothing 
compares quite as well. 

There  is  also a more conscious attempt to  please  the  merchandising 
lobby,  which  might explain the excreable Jar-Jar Binks,  and also the 
pod race, which might have been put  together by a team of console game 
designers?  This might also explain  the ghastly Ewoks in Return of the 
Jedi (episode 6.) "George,  this Star  Wars is great, but it's too much 
of a 'boy' thing, we need a cuddly toy  alien to factor in the chicks!"

Above  all,  it loses out by trying to establish authority as the first 
episode  of  an  epic  tale,  when that has already been  done  by  the 
original  Star  Wars  episode 3.  The reason why Phantom Menace  is  so  
unsatisfactory,  is  that it ultimately mutated into the original horse 
designed by a committee, a camel!
