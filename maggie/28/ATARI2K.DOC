                      Atari In The New Millennium

                                                               pink/rg 
======================================================================

It's a new year. It's  a  new  millennium.  A time for new beginnings, 
fresh starts, resolutions, fireworks. But  what  is the future for the 
atari scene in the new century.

On the face of it, things look bleak. 1999 was not a good year for our 
beloved atari. Some famous figures quit  the scene. There were no real 
ground  breaking  demos  on  the  Falcon.  Those  perpetually  delayed 
projects continued to be delayed.

But 99 wasn't without its highlights.  There was a re-emergence of the 
ST scene, with some brilliant demos  being released. The EIL party was 
an absolute triumph ( thanks again to all the organisers ).

But productivity  was  at  an  all  time  low.  RG  produced virtually 
nothing. Even the ever reliable DHS weren't running at full steam, and 
their release were not of  the  same  quality as their ground breaking 
1998 productions.

Although people were quiet, they were still hanging in there. They may 
not have so much free time, they may  appear  on IRC less - but in the 
background projects are being  worked  on.  I  expect to be pleasantly 
surprised by some releases in the forthcoming year.   (Such as something  
 from RG themselves perhaps?! - Wondering what the hell is going on Ed) 

One of the problems is that whilst  other technology has marched on at 
an alarming rate, the atari scene has virtually stood still. In 1988 I 
was running an 8mhz system, who would  have thought that come the year 
2000 I would only be running a  16mhz  system. I still have no PC, and 
 have no intention of  buying  one.  But  I  would  dearly  love a more 
powerful atari system.

Centek have toyed with  our  emotions  by  promising  us the world and 
snatching it all away at the last minute. There have been powerful but 
expensive computers like the Hades that have only limited appeal.

For those wanting a new atari system for the new millennium, there are 
currently three choices:

PHENIX 260

The phoenix is a  legendary  bird,  and  this company's computers seem 
more and more  like  fables.  They  are  difficult  to  contact, their 
website is rarely updated and they don't seem to be very professional. 

Having said that, they have an absolutely superb design for a computer 
and if they were ever to get round to manufacturing it, you would be a 
fool to miss out. 

The original phenix design seems  to  be  dead and buried. When Centek 
merged with Class4, it seems that  the laser company nicked the Dolmen 
programmers and the o/s  couldn't  possibly  be finished. The hardware 
was finished,  but  without  an  operating  system  it  was  virtually 
useless. 

The idea behind the Phenix 260  is  to  take an established o/s (MINT) 
and configure it for new hardware.

SPECS

CPU   :      68060 @ 83 MHz ( 125 mips )
        or 2x68060 @ 83 MHz ( 250 mips )

BUS   : 32 bits @ 83mhz ( 256MB/sec )

SLOTS : AGP 3.3V
         PCI 3.3V/5V 32bit @ 33mhz ( 132 MB/sec )

RAM   : SDRAM  @ 83MHz ( 166 MB/sec )
        ESDRAM @ 83MHz ( 221 MB/sec )

The machine comes with the following hardware:

* Internal ZIP drive ( 100 MB ) 
* 32 MB of SDRAM 
* AGP Rage Pro 3D Card 
* 6.4 GB Ultra DMA Hard Drive 
* CD-ROM drive 
* PS/2 Mouse & Keyboard 
* ATX Mini Tower

Price:  with 1x68060  913 Euros
        with 2x68060 1142 Euros

PLUS

This machine is hugely capable.  Sure,  it  lacks  a DSP, but when you 
have two 060s one of them can perform all the tasks a DSP could and is 
a lot easier to program! It would  also have access to the entirety of 
main RAM, negating the bottleneck problems of DSP memory transfers.

The 68060 is a brilliant processor,  and  its performance ( 125 MIPS ) 
is astonishing when you consider the Falcon's 030 runs at 3.84 MIPS!

The bus is a full 32 bits and the data transfer rate is fast.

MINUS

There appears to  be  no  soundchip?  I  suppose  you  could  fit a PC 
soundcard to it, but it would be better if one came as standard.

The biggest drawback is that it  comes from Centek. We've been waiting 
four years for a  computer  from  them,  and  now  the  signs are less 
 promising  than  ever.  This  computer  is  highly  unlikely  to  ever 
materialise, which is a shame because it's great.


MILAN 060

When Milan Computers introduced  their  Milan040,  it  was  met with a 
muted response from the atari scene.  Sure,  an  040 is nice - but not 
nice enough. We need a  bigger  leap  in  performance to tempt us away 
from our Falcons.

The other problem with the Milan040  is that it was very dad-oriented. 
Whilst Centek promised us cool features like  dual CPUs and a DSP, the 
Milan was just a bog standard atari clone  in a box. There was not too 
much for demo &  games  coders  to  get  excited  about.  But with the 
Milan060, they seem to have rectified the situation.

SPECS

CPU      :   68060 @ 66 MHz
           ( 68060 @ 80 MHz under development )

RAM      : 64 MB of SDRAM @ 66/80 Mhz

HD       : 10 GB Hard Drive

SOUND    : SoundBlaster SB64 ( PCI )

GRAPHICS :  ATI Mach 64 - 4 MB VideoRam
          ( expandable to 10 MB )

FLOPPY   : 1.44 MB

CD-ROM   : 40xSpeed CD-ROM drive

SLOTS    : 2 x IDE
           3 x serial
            1 x parallel
           2 x USB
           3 x ISA
           4 x PCI

O/S      : MagiC & jinnee

SUMMARY

This is an extremely well  specced  atari  box. Unlike the Phenix, its 
not trying to do anything clever  -  the  emphasis here is on solidity 
rather than experimentation.  Unlike  the  phenix,  this computer will 
probably actually get released.

Again, this uses a 68060. If it uses  the current speed of 66 MHz that 
would be more than respectable, but  it  would  be great if they could 
get the 80 MHz versions working.

64MB of RAM should be enough for most Atari applications (!), and with 
10 GB hard drive you could probably  store all the atari software ever 
made!

There are a good amount of  slots  for  adding extra peripherals - the 
USB slot is a smart addition.

Whilst 4 MB of video  ram  may  seem  small  in today's world, that is 
still equivalent to the entirety  of  standard Falcon memory! Even the 
PlayStation2 has only 4 MB of video ram!

The main plus is that Milan are  a computer that get things done. They 
may not be underground, cool, scene or be anything more than glorified 
box shifters. But they  do  deliver  the  goods,  and  at a reasonable 
price.

The Milan060 has the capability to  be  a  great computer for the demo 
and games scene. It has a fast  CPU,  lots  of RAM and a nice graphics 
chip. It has everything going for it.
 

SILICON FRUIT RIORED

What in the Wide World  of  Sport  is Silicon Fruit's RioRed? Although 
this name may be unfamiliar to  most  readers, it has the potential to 
be the biggest of the three.

Silicon Fruit are  a  internet  based  company  -  there employees are 
scattered across the world. Their aim is to provide a computer that is 
a genuine alternative to the PCs and  MACs  of this world. So what has 
that got to do with the atari scene?

The fact is that the  people  who  are  designing the hardware for the 
RioRed are none other than Centek.  The architecture is similar to the 
Phenix, and there is a chance  that  MiNT  may be one of the operating 
systems that ships with it.

For now, let's just drool over the specs:

CPU : 2 x G4 @ 450 MHz ( 1500 MIPS )

DSP : Texas Instruments DSP

RAM : 64 MB

SLOTS : 4 x PCI @ 33 MHz ( 32 bit )
        2 x PCI @ 66 MHz ( 64 bit )
        1 x AGP ( 3.3V )
        1 x PCI IDE
        1 x PCI USB

The PowerPC G4 is an awesome processor, and to have two of them in one 
machine AND a DSP is unheard  of.  Both  G4s  have a 2 MB Level2 cache 
attached to them with a massive 1.8 GB/sec bandwidth.

The performance of this machine is  better  than any PC on the market. 
 It would even give the DreamCast  and  PSX2  a run for its money. It's 
truly awesome. So what's the catch?

The first problem is that its  not  specifically an atari machine, and 
is likely to ship with linux. Silicon  Fruit  are going for as large a 
market share as possible so they  want  to appeal to Amiga freaks, Mac 
users and disgruntled windoze sufferers.  MiNT  is still a possibility 
at some point though.

The main problem is that Centek  are  designing the hardware, and they 
are company whose name has  become  synonymous with the words "vapour" 
and "ware".

If the RioRed ever  appears  then  this  will  be  a seriously awesome 
machine. Lets hope Silicon Fruit don't slip on a banana skin.

OVERALL

Three contenders. Three players. Only one victor. Who is going to take 
the mantle of 'atari machine for the next millennium'. 

By just examining the stats it  has  to be the RioRed. Its performance 
is staggering, and it will gain support  from a broad range of people. 
But its not a true atari machine. The best 'atari-like' machine is the 
Phenix - the machine that the  Falcon  should  have been. But its past 
has been shaky and its future looks bleak.

The surprise winner  of  'Maggie  Machine  for  the  Millenium' is the 
Milan060. It's not as radical, or  as  exciting as the other machines. 
Its not got the  cool  features  of  the  Phenix  or  the power of the 
RioRed. It has no DSP. It hasn't  got the underground cool of Centek's 
productions. 

The Milan060 wins because it is  stable,  solid and actually likely to 
get produced. It is the most  atari-oriented machine of the three, and 
the 68060 is a nice processor.

 So if you are looking to upgrade in the near future, get a Milan060. 
Should the Phenix or RioRed  ever  turn  up, they are definitely worth 
getting hold of, but why wait for Godot when the Milan-nium is here?
