Primary mission    :  Turn on the main power supply switch.

Secondary mission  :  Turn on the incredible underground machine.


You start this level in a large room that has a stepped floor, there is 
also  a  terminal  on the wall with a medikit next to  it.  Someone  is 
shooting at you as soon as you start, so first things first, get rid of 
them.  Go  through  the  large opening into a room that  has  a  raised 
walkway  running through it.  Kill the 3 blue uniformed technicians  in 
this room.  Go back into the room with stepped floor and go through the 
door.

Shoot  the  2 technicians that you see patrolling the  opposite  ledge. 
Drop  off  the ledge to get to a lower level.  Kill the technician  and 
pick up the ammo,  shield and medikit.  Use the lift platform where you 
dropped down to go up.  Jump onto the lef hand ledge where you shot the 
2  technicians  just  a  moment ago.  Pick up the ammo  and  enter  the 
corridor.

You enter a room with a large column in the middle. In an aclove on the 
right is a tramp, kill him and the tramp behind the column. Pick up the 
ammo.  Jump  up  the  stairs around the back of the  column,  kill  the 
technician as you go up, pick up the blue key waiting at the top.

Make your way back to the room with the raised walkway running  through 
it.  In the far right is a door,  go through. Kill the 2 hunchbacks and 
pick up the ammo.  Turn right and follow the corridor along, kill the 2 
technicians, pick up the ammo and go through the door.

 You're  now in a room with a central partition.  Kill the 2 technicians 
ahead,  and  another waiting round the corner on the left.  Pick up the 
medikit,  shield  and  ultra scanner.  Continue down the left hand side 
partition. At the end is another room that's on a lower level, kill the 
technician on the stairs over to the left.

Drop  of the ledge,  pick up the medikit.  Go up the stairs and through 
the door. Kill the tramp and pick up the ammo.

You  now  enter a large open space,  kill the technician hiding on  the 
right.  Run  forward  and kill another technician on a lower  platform. 
Then kill the tramp on the platform in the corner of the room,  pick up 
the medikit and the shield.

Look  for  a switch on a wall,  you should be able to see it easily  if 
you're standing on a ledge.  It's on the left hand side wall, flick the 
switch and make your way through the door (don't hang about).

Make your way along the corridor,  pick up the shield, turn right, kill 
the tramp and pick up the medikit. Use the lift platform to go up, kill 
another tramp and pick up the ammo.

Go  down some stairs,  pick up the shield,  flick the switch then go up 
the other stairs.  Turn right at the top,  kill the tramp,  pick up the 
medikit and ammo,  continue along and turn left,  kill a technician and 
another tramp.

You  are now on a walled ledge overlooking a room,  in the middle is  a 
column  with windows,  you should see a hunchback and technician,  kill 
them  both.  As you are up high you should have no problem killing  all 
the  other  people in this room.  Use the ultra scanner to  find  their 
location and kill them.  Jump onto the wall and you'll be able to see a 
ledge  a  bit lower down.  Drop down onto it and pick up a medikit  and 
some invisibility.  Drop down again onto the floor and pick up the ammo 
and save the game at the terminal on the wall.

Enter the corridor leading off from the room, you'll see a circular saw 
 blade blocking your way. A running jump should see you clear it easily. 
Go left and jump up the ledge in the corridor and kill the technician.

You  are  about to enter a loading bay,  use your invisibility to  make 
your  job  a bit easier.  Pick up the ammo and make your way  onto  the 
loading bay.  Kill the 3 technicians patrolling near the door.  Pick up 
the ammo, medikit and shield. Carry along to the far end of the loading 
bay and kill another technician and a tramp. Pick up more ammo a shield 
and a map.

Go  through  the back doors of the lorry,  kill a tramp hiding  inside, 
pick up the red key.  Remember where you are as you'll be back this way 
a bit later.

Jump onto the conveyor belt which is at the far end of the loading bay, 
pick  up the medikit and drop off.  Just to the right there is a hidden 
door  in  the wall,  use the spacebar to get in,  you'll find a monster 
detector inside. Continue along following the conveyor belt to the end, 
kill the tramp and pick up the ammo.

Jump  onto the other conveyor belt,  and kill a technician.  This leads 
into another room  with bright yellow walls.  Kill the 2 tramps in this 
room,  one on the floor the other on some crates,  pick up the ammo and 
shield.

Go  through  the large door on the right.  Kill the technician and  the 
tramp,  go  left and kill another technician hiding behind a wall.  Use 
the lift platform and go up,  pick up the medikit.  On the right at the 
end  of the ledge is a door.  Inside is a security monitor,  this shows 
you the burger bar (mmmm I'm feeling hungry).

Exit  the room and turn right,  go to the end of the room and turn left 
and  go through the door.  Follow the corridor round,  kill a tramp and 
pick  up  some medikits,  carry on and use the lift platform to go  up. 
Kill another tramp and go out the door (blue key door).

You'll  find yourself on a ledge next to some water,  on the other side 
 of the water is a technician and a tramp. Kill the technician then do a 
running  jump  onto  the other ledge ,go up some stairs  and  kill  the 
tramp.  Now  do  a running jump back over to where you just came  from. 
Pick up the ammo,  radiation suit and shield. Now you can save the game 
at the terminal. For some extra fun take a few shots at the barrels.

Go  back up the stairs on the other side and into a corridor,  pick  up 
the  shield,  kill the technician,  jump up into the alcove on the left 
and you should see some more invisibility in a pit, get this. Drop back 
down ino he corridor.  Pick up the ammo and medikit, enter the corridor 
on the left, kill the tramp, pick up the ammo and enter the room. There 
is a high ledge in the center with a tramp on top of it taking shots at 
you.  Make  your way round to the left of the ledge,  going up and down 
some stairs, pick up the medikit on the way round.

Kill another tramp at the end of the room, use the lift platform to get 
up  to the high ledge,  kill the tramp and flick the switch that he was 
guarding.  Drop off of the ledge and go to the back of the room, up the 
staris. Pick up some more ammo and then flick the switch that says MAIN 
POWER SUPPLY. You have now completed the primary mission. Save the game 
at the terminal on the wall.

Exit the room through the doorway that you came in. Turn right and kill 
the technician on the lower ledge, drop down and pick up the ammo, drop 
down again and flick a switch on the wall below.  Use the lift platform 
to go up, walk onto a pillar, turn right a bit and do a running jump to 
the pillar in the middle of the room,  do another running jump onto the 
ledge at the far end of the room.  There is a time limit on the switch, 
if you are not quick enough,  you won't get through the door that is on 
the left at the back of the ledge.

Turn left and kill 2 tramps,  pick up the ammo and medikit.  Turn right 
and  go through a doorway,  kill a tramp and technician and pick up the 
ammo. Jump up onto the ledge where the technician was and make your way 
through the opening, drop down and kill the tramp, get the ammo.

Kill  the tramp in the water filled corridor on the right and  pick  up 
 the  medikit and shield.  Follow the corridor along and pick up another 
medikit.  Around the corner is a terminal high up on the wall, save the 
game  here.  Continue along the water filled corridor and take the next 
corridor on the right and go through the door.

You  are  now in a large,  very long water filled room,  there are high 
ledges  all around the room from where you will be shot at.  So turn on 
your  invisibility  and make your way down the room.  Look for  a  lift 
platform in a small alcove to the right at the far end of the room.

Jump  up into the alcove and use the lift platform to go up,  kill  the 
hunchback at the top,  you are now in a corridor that has vented walls, 
kill  the  hunchback at the end of the corridor and pick up  the  ammo, 
turn left and follow the corridor to the end.

There now follows a bit of a shooting match, kill the 4 technicians and 
the  tramp  that are on the high ledges.  If you haven't died then  you 
were lucky.

Jump  over to the central ledge and pick up ammo and nightviewer.  Do a 
running  jump over to the ledge on the right hand side and pick up  the 
medikit,  shield and ammo,  jump back to the middle ledge.  Drop off to 
the  left hand side and pick up the green key.  Now drop back into  the 
water and make your way back up the room to the door where you entered.

Go  left,  back up the flooded corridor until you get to the end,  jump 
out  and go down the corridor that has lights on the walls,  go through 
the door (green key door), save the game at the terminal.

What did that terminal say ???

Trust me - and try the big lion jump....hmmm

It  looks like a clue...and it is.  If you want to get into the  burger 
bar  you'll  need the yellow key.  Anyway follow the corridor and  turn 
left,  kill the 2 tramps on a ledge on the other side of the room, do a 
running jump to get across the gap.
 
Pick  up the medikit and turn right and kill another tramp on a  ledge. 
Carry along the ledge and pick up the ammo, now turn left. You'll see a 
raised  platform with a doorway on top with a fire extinguisher on  the 
wall,  the  yellow  key  is in here.  You can try to do a running  jump 
across to it but it's just too far. So how to do you get to it ??

Look at the crappy diagram below, you should see something like this if 
you turn on the map...maybe not.


                           |   |

             _-ÿ  |________|        |ÿÿÿ| <- Jump from here to the
          _-ÿ            :          |   |    invisible platform.
        ÿÿÿÿÿ|         _-ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ    |

          ÿ-_            :                <- doorway leading
             ÿ-_  |ÿÿÿÿÿÿ|ÿ-_   _-ÿÿÿÿÿÿ     to corridor with
                ÿ-|      |-ÿ =-ÿ             vented walls.
                         |_-ÿ


There is an invisible platform that you have to jump to first in  order 
to reach the doorway.  Keep close to the wall on the right,  do a small 
running  jump onto the invisible platform,  you should hear some music, 
turn left a bit and do a running jump diagonally across to the doorway. 
Once inside kill the technician and get the yellow key that's hidden at 
the back of the room.

Exit the room and drop off of the ledge,  pick up the medikits and make 
your  way to the doorway next to the raised platform.  You are now in a 
 corridor that has vented walls.  Continue along this corridor, kill the 
tramp, pick up the medikit and shield.

Now  enter a large room that contains a tall column.  Kill a tramp  and 
technician,  pick up the ammo and medikit, use the lift platform in the 
tall column and go up,  kill another tramp.  Turn right and do a couple 
of jumps to get across to another ledge.

There are stairs to the right,  go up them and turn left, go left again 
at  the  doorway and carry along.  Kill the technician and pick up  the 
shields, save the game at the exit terminal.

Right,  that's your lot. I've already done way too much for you. You've 
now got all the keys, completed he primary mission, and found where the 
exit is.  The secondary mission is nearby and so is the burger bar,  if 
you don't mind walking. You passed the doorway that led to them.

Here  are a couple of hints that might help you,  the switch that opens 
the  secondary  mission door is hidden in a train.  You'll also find  a 
transporter  pad  behind it,  you'll have to use it to get back to  the 
exit. When you use the transporter pad you'll find yourself in the back 
of  a lorry on the loading bay.  That's where you picked up the red key 
earlier.

There's quite a lot of this level that hasn't even visited,  as well as 
a few hidden rooms and objects that have still to be picked up.

 HAVE FUN!
