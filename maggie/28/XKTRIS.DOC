               Another never to be completed masterpiece? 
 
It's another Tetris game! There isn't too much more to be said about it 
really.

Well, I can add that this is yet another project that got stuck halfway 
and died.  This pre-preview version,  or whatever, comes to us courtesy 
of  Van  Eijk  of Quast,  or formerly of Quast,  as he got rid  of  his 
Falcon.  (This  was  the prize that Syntax's coder Sqward got  for  his 
Orneta competition busting 'When Bumblebee flies higher than Falcon'

It is then thanks to Grey of the Mystic Bytes,  that we even got to see 
this much of the game!

There is enough to give a flavour of what might have been,  as we get a 
gorgeous 256/truecolour full screens worth of action, thanks to HamTech 
of the Votion. The game window is on the left hand side, the right hand 
containing the scores,  and more decorative graphics.  This is a bright 
and good-looking game,  the overall look and design dating back about a 
couple of years or so.

For some users,  the lack of an RGB screen-mode might hold it back,  it 
is a VGA-only game.

In  terms of playability,  it is a perfectly ordinary functional Tetris 
game.  Blocks  drop  down,  you slot them into place,  try to stop them 
creeping up the screen too far. Nothing more, nothing less either.

It  was as if Van Eijk realised there wasn't that much of a gap in  the 
market for Atari based Tetris type games when he stopped.  It is a very 
bland game,  caught between the devil-may-care madness of the Reservoir 
Gods  multiplayer 'Skyfall',  and even losing out to ST-based variants, 
such  as Empty Head Software's 'Tetris 2000',  with its wealth of extra 
features.  This  is  possibly why this game seems to have got stuck  in 
such an early state of suspended animation?

There isn't anything to criticise here, but not an awful lot that makes 
it stand out either.
