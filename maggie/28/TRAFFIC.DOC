You're  a  good  driver.  You watch the speed limit,  remain calm,  and 
observe  not  only the rules of the road,  but also the etiquette.  And 
since  you  drive so safely and so politely,  in just about  any  city, 
you'll  live a long time.  Long enough to drive slower and slower  with 
each passing decade until you're one of those old people in a big  car, 
going ten miles under the speed limit in the fast lane and pissing  all 
the rest of us off.  Except in Los Angeles, of course, where the proper 
term  for  you  is "road kill".  You,  do not qualify to drive  in  Los 
Angeles. Please leave the city immediately!

with...  Well,  all of us except your mother, because "you're going too 
fast!  Watch out for that car in front of you!  You're going to kill us 
all!" In Los Angeles,  the proper term for you is "survivor".  Complete
