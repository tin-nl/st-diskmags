<note: to CIH and Felice:>

One of the programmers on the MAME is a guy called Eric Smith, he used 
to work for Atari and he wrote MultiTOS, he wrote part some code to 
emulate the Atari Pokey chip which is also found in the XL/XE 
computer.  Presumably he has inside knowledge of fair bit of some of 
Atari's stuff!

Ok, multiTOS has a bit of bad reputation but his e-mail address is 
mentioned in the Mame docs so I'll ask him if *maybe* if he wouldn't 
mind doing a little interview about him when he was working for Atari 
and what he does now.  :)))))


This is what I've got in mind for questions, let me know if there is 
anything I could add.


How old are you and what was your first computer?  Are there any old 
games you have fond memories of??

How did you start off on the Atari scene?

What was first program, and what other things have you written over 
the years?

How did you get contacted by Atari to write MultiTOS?

What do you think of the Falcon and the way it was sold?

How did the MAME team get together and start getting these ancient 
games translated on to PCs?

Where do you work now??

What do you think of Windows and today's modern operating systems?
