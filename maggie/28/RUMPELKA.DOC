                               by Stax/TNB 

 Some  old,  something  new,  something  slung together in a  cellar  in 
Dresden, shared with a certain Maggie disk editor, last Easter!

This  was  the surprise of the Error in Line party,  a dark horse  demo 
entry,  come  in  from groups and individuals who were thought to  have 
given up active participation on the Atari scene.  Boy,  were we wrong, 
and so glad to be wrong on this occasion!

I  got  to  see this demo in various stages of  being  completed,  that 
weekend,  and  got  to know it quite well.  A pleasing blend of old and 
new.

This  is  quite a compact program for what you get,  runnable from  the 
desktop,  and about 150 kb filesize. It can run on most combinations of 
ST,  subject  to  a  memory  requirement of two megs,  and oh  yes,  it 
shouldn't  be  a Falcon.  Probably,  some very system specific code  is 
needed to get that 'borderless' overscanned look.

The main screen is a ST-Coders dream, a solid 'borderless' full screen, 
with a top white border and the bottom is blue.  All the action happens 
inbetween.  A red 'stax' logo near the top right as 'design' attempt to 
fill  the blank space.  This theme remains constant throughout all  the 
different  parts  of  the demo.  The other faithful companion,  is  the 
soundchip  music,  a rousing early SID-screamer,  by Scavenger of Dutch 
demo demigods, Synergy.

The title of the demo 'Rumpelkammer' appears, very well drawn, and very 
petite flame effects scorch brightly inside the lettering.

Part  one  is dedicated to vectors,  lots of them.  We start with  some 
simple solid ST-ish stuff, a huge pyramid, the pinnacle of many coder's 
achievements  back  in the early days.  next,  a five-pointed poly star 
makes  a fleeting appearance,  before giving way to a fine line  vector 
torus.

The  most elaborate polygon,  a multicoloured fighter plane poly  spins 
against an appealing colour background background.

To  finish this section,  a lightsource shaded bi-colour pyramid  lurks 
moodily in the centre of the screen.

Part two next, this is the Bitmaps section.

Another  classic of later period ST demos,  a scrolltext,  but one with 
zooms  back  and  forth,  then  we are straight into  a  textured  cube 
plastered   with  penguins!   This  is  quite  good,   but  technically 
overshadowed by Defjam's efforts in 'Suretrip', a bit later in the same 
competition!

A  touch of Dead Hackers influence next,  with a quick texture  tunnel, 
very  reimiscent  of  early  efforts of the sort  on  the  Falcy.  This 
concludes  part  two,  which was really only keeping the seat warm  for 
part 3..

The  promisingly  titled  'Moving  Worlds'  has  in  store  for  us,  a 
Wolfenstein Dungeon.  Now this isn't a totally unknown effect,  even on 
an  ST,  but  it  is still good to see this.  This one is a  reasonable 
effort,  not  too  coarse a resolution,  and still pretty quick.  Also, 
controllable  from  the keyboard,  and could form the basis of a  valid 
game  engine,  even  on  a  standard ST.  Like its more  famous  Falcon 
counterpart  'Running',  the  floors  and ceiling are  untextured,  and 
rather plain in this case.

The  next  'moving world' is even closer to the holy grail of  being  a 
complete  and  playable game.  This is a well realised Mario Kart  with 
Snes-style mode 7 rotating floor,  and a good looking skyline/backdrop.
Like  the 'Penguinstein' dungeon before it,  this is controllable  too, 
this  time  via a good old 9-pin joystick.  Looks like  another  thirty 
minutes work, could see this in action as a full game. (So I exaggerate 
a bit, but this is so close!)

In  a  final  climax,  the boys from RDT get involved,  with a  fractal 
canyon-scape  flythough.  The  horizon  from the  'pilots'  view  tilts 
dramatically left and right. Bringing its own summery charm are a bunch 
of solid bars graduating to form a  blue skyline.

All good things have to come to an end, at least until you click to run 
them again,  and this demo is no exception. The end credits oare night, 
with some little 3D bob spinning balls.  A clown waves goodbye, then we 
are returned back to the desktop, which is good of the coders.

'Rumplekammer'  is a very likeable demo,  having a distinctive style of 
its  own,  with  more than an affectionate glance at past  glories.  As 
I've  said  in  the main party report,  at Error in Line,  it  had  the 
misfortune to come up against Checkpoint and their killer/winner effort 
'Suretrip'.

 Ratings.. 

 Effects:-  80% -  Not the strongest in the whole competition,  but  some 
good interpretations of past glories, and some nice up to date twists.

 Graphics:- 85% -  Consistently high quality throughout.

 Sound:-  75%  -   Classic Scavenger tune,  overshadowed by  more  recent 
composers, but entirely appropriate for this production.

 Overall:- 82% -  Effortless old school showcase.
