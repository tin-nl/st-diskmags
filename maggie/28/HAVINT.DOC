(Peter,  please feel free to answer any or all of the questions below, 
but  try  to give fairly detailed answers where you can,  rather  than 
just one or two words. Cheers m8 )

 
Can you give us a bit of your life history so far ? Where you were 
born, which schools you attended, etc.
 
I was born in 1977 in a town called Emmen (that's in the northeast  of 
Holland).  Soon  after,  my parents decided to move to a small village 
called  Babberich.  That's where I spent most of my childhood,  except 
for a few short periods abroad.  After finishing my primary education, 
I  moved on to an atheneum near where I lived.  I spent 7 years trying 
to  get  my exams,  then decided I had seen enough of that school  and 
went to a bigger school a little bit further away.

That  turned out to be a good choice,  and one year later I passed  my 
exams. Then I had to choose a study or career. Originally, I wanted to 
go to the military academy,  but I wasn't allowed to because I was too 
tall.  So  after  a  lot  of doubting,  I moved to Venlo  and  studied 
logistics there.  At the beginning of the third year, I could not cope 
with the massive amount of administrative and economical classes  that 
were  part of logistics anymore.  My grades were okey-ish,  but I felt 
very  unsure about my motivation for the next two years.  So I decided 
to quit my study in Venlo and I moved to Enschede to study  Multimedia 
Design and Technology. 

The first period is almost over now, and I must say that I really like 
what  I'm doing here up to now.  This study is a mix of technical  and 
artistic  classes,  and  a lot of projects are involved as  well.  For 
instance,  we're going to make a small film during the next period. It 
should  be about 10-30 minutes and we'll have equipment and  a  studio 
for two days. You might think that this is boring, but to me it's like 
a dream come true.  We get to play with high-end equipment and you can 
even get a degree this way...  To keep it a bit more computer-related, 
there's also this rendering facility at school where half a dozen  SGI 
machines are running Alias/Maya. Incredible stuff, and I can play with 
it for free!


 How did you get involved with Atari computers in the beginning ?  

Back in 1985,  my uncle bought a ST. He used it to program 68000 and C 
stuff for his job at an aerospace research facility. Before that, both 
him and my dad had bought several computers (TRS80,  early PC's,  CP/M 
machines)  which I had also been playing around with,  but the ST  was 
the first machine that really hooked me.

I  can  vividly remember the many days I  spent  drawing  kiddie-style 
aeroplanes and cars in Degas.  The incredibly sharp image of the SM124 
was  just  amazing!  Soon after,  I had a C64 for a while, but I never 
used for anything serious and,  to be honest,  I didn't really like it 
for any reason but the games at that time.  In 1988,  I finally got my 
own Atari. At first, I didn't get the setup I really wanted, because I 
thought  that  a  colour display was never going to be  any  good  for 
drawing. How wrong I could be! 

The  first program I loaded on my ST was (again) the  original  Degas. 
Disappointed  at  the blockyness of the pixels,  I didn't use it  much 
apart  from  playing  games for a while.  Then I got a copy  of  Degas 
Elite,  and suddenly I was able to "rip" graphics from games.  I could 
load  the PC1 files into Degas,  and then I started using the zoom for 
the first time. If those game designers can make such flashy graphics, 
then so can I,  I thought.  It turned out to be a little harder than I 
had thought at first, but after about 10 years of intensive pixelling, 
I finally dare to say that I reach the level of what I saw as a little 
kid.  I never regretted getting a ST, actually, my first ST (a 260) is 
still being used every once in a while.


 What are your favourite demos ?  

That's a really tough question.  I like all demos in general,  as long 
as  they're at least *trying* to get the maximum out of a  machine.  I 
have  many  favourites,  but I'll try to name the ones that  made  the 
biggest impact on me.

On  ST,  the  first demo I saw was a TEX cracktro.  MCA had some  cool 
stuff  too,  I can remember.  The first demo that made me go crazy was 
the  Union  demo.  Although outdated today,  it's still a classic  and 
definitely one of the demos I respect most. Mindbomb was the next hit, 
Syntax  Terror (Match-It!),  Dark Side of the Spoon and ofc ourse  all 
stuff  by  TCB.  Then the "newschool" period started,  and my personal 
favorite from this period is the Synergy megademo. It is so ultimately 
designed,  optimized,  freaked,  just crazy!  I'm pretty sure that the 
guys from Synergy got the best out of themselves, and that's something 
I've (and the rest of FUN too,  btw) still got to do.  It will happen, 
trust me. One day.

On Falcon,  my favourite demos are Obnoxious and Sonolumineszenz.  Why 
Obnoxious?  Well,  once again, the design of this demo is so awsome... 
The same goes for Sono,  and it's also got some of the most impressive 
effects  I've  ever  seen on the Falcon.  I'm also impressed  by  what 
Mystic  Bytes  has  shown up to now,  but they haven't  reached  their 
maximum  yet.  They're great and there's just one way from there:  get 
even better lads,  you're up to it!  DHS deserves a place here too.  I 
like their style of design,  but unfortunately, I haven't been able to 
see  their  demos  that often because of the lack of  a  FPU.  They're 
definetely among the top, though.


 And your favourite games ? (recent or oldies)  

I  stopped playing action games when I was about 15,  and still  don't 
like them very much.  My all-time favourites include Civilization, Sim 
City,  Railroad Tycoon,  Starcraft etc etc. If I'd have to mention one 
action game, it'd be Xenon II. The graphics are awsome!


 What prompted you to become one of the active members of FUN ?  

I  was  hanging around on #atari,  just for some chat,  and then I met 
Earx and NUT.  After a while, I thought about it again, and decided to 
return to the Atari scene.  I had been doing PC stuff for a while, but 
after a very negative experience (concerning money,  supposed friends, 
game-development  and  betrayal)  I had quit  that  scene  and  wasn't 
planning to do scene stuff ever again. But the memories of my old days 
in   the  Giants  made  me  realise  that  demoscening  is  the   best 
entertainment  I've ever had,  and so I decided to go into active mode 
again.  

FUN  came up at exactly the right moment,  and I'm still happy that  I 
joined.  It's all in a name, if it wasn't for fun, I wouldn't do this. 
Fame and money is nice, and I'm sure I could get a lot more of that in 
the PC scene. But it wouldn't be the same fun. I'd rather compete with 
friends  in  16  colors and win a can of beer than having  to  fake  a 
picture,  lie about faking, be arrogant and win a couple of hundred or 
thousand dollars. That's just besides the point, I think.

 
Which top movies (in your opinion) have you seen recently, either 
in the cinema or on video ?
 
 Very few, actually. I've not been able to go to the theatre in quite a 
while because of financial difficulties.  Luckily, I can see a film on 
pay-tv every once in a while.  The last movie that really impressed me 
was Citizen Kane (I had never seen it before),  an old classic that is 
really   worth   the  time.   I  also  like  the  "new   wave"   films 
(Trainspotting,  Tarantino in general etc),  and anything Monty Python 
related is great too.


 Who is/are your favourite movie actors and actresses ?  

Never  really  thought  about that a lot,  but Jack Nicholson  and  Al 
Pacino are always good. Even though I don't like some of their movies, 
their  acting  in those is still great.  Female actresses is  hard  to 
answer.  I could say that I like Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz,  but 
I'm not that sure if that's just because of their acting. ;)

 
What  music  are you into these days ?  Please give  details  for 
those who might not have heard .. :)
 
A  lot!  Currently,  I'm really into industrial(-alike) music like for 
instance Front242,  KMFDM and Sisters of Mercy. I wouldn't know how to 
describe  this  kind  of music,  it's basically lots  of  electronics, 
sometimes  mixed with guitars.  Maybe electronic rock would be a  good 
description?  I  also  enjoy house and techno music of all sorts,  but 
there's a lot of crap coming out these days. You could also wake me up 
for a good metal concert anytime, I love the Prodigy and Chemicals and 
Underworld  and  and  and...  Oh,  did I mention that I  plundered  my 
uncle's collection of classical music a week ago yet? :)


 Some words to react to:-
 

 PC's 

Necessary evil I think. PC's are easy to get and cheap, and that's the 
only good thing about them. I've got one at home, which I only use for 
three purposes: school, Internet and Atariscening. 


 Software piracy  

Mixed feelings.  On one hand, I'm happy that it exists. What other way 
is  there  to really test a program before you buy it?  On  the  other 
hand,  people  won't buy what they can also get for free.  If everyone 
would just pay for what they really use...


 ethh (from IRC) :)  

A  very  deranged person who does not understand the basics  of  human 
interaction.  I'm  ashamed that people like him are/have been part  of 
the Atari scene. 


 UCM  

Great diskmagazine! Regretfully I had to stop my work for the magazine 
because of a lack of time and because of circumstances.


 MSG  

Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! 
People  who  hum  tunes from Obnoxious all day long  must  have  great 
taste. ;)


 NUN  

A bunch of very sad people who are trying to imitate us and damage our 
good name.  They're not funny whatsoever and their "demos" are some of 
the  worst in history.  I cannot understand why they won't join the PC 
scene, that's the right place for such crap.


 The arcade machine emulation scene  

I'm  not  really into,  because I don't like action games  that  much. 
Still,  respect  out to the guys who are coding such stuff- much  more 
interesting than PC demos I think!


 Your fellow FUN members (active or otherwise)  

Great friends,  very skilled as well. All of them have their strengths 
and  weaknesses,  but together we form a perfect team.  The best thing 
about  it  all is that we can always trust each other and  are  always 
ready to help eachother out.  If FUN wasn't the kind of crew it is,  I 
could never keep up this motivation for such a long time. Thanks guys!


 MC Laser :-)  

Great musician,  friendly guy and very good news editor.  Too bad he's 
in  such an inactive crew,  but luckily we can hear his work in  other 
productions.

 
Well,  thanks,  Peter,  for your time in answering these questions. If 
you  have anything else to announce from yourself or FUN,  please feel 
free to insert that below.

Cheers !

Felice/Maggie Team
 
No problem, it was a pleasure! 

Message  out  to all Atari-sceners:  Keep it up mates!  The good times 
will  be here as long as we want them to be,  we've got it in our  own 
hands... So make it happen!

Cheers,


/Peter.
