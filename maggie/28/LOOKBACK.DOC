                  The Atari Scene - The Last 1000 Years? 

The  title  doesn't make a lot of sense,  neither of them do,  but  you 
might like to know,  this is the grand-daddy of all the millenium-based 
retrospectives  on  the  fairly recent past doing  the  rounds  at  the 
moment.  Well, maybe not so much 'grand-daddy', more 'strange uncle you 
only see once a year, if you really have to'?

When we say '1000 years of Atari scene', you should really take that to 
properly mean the last 10-15 years, of course. As any fool knows, up to 
these  most recent decades,  a RISC chip wasn't even a gleam in Charles 
Babbage's  eye,  and  most people got by with using pebbles and bits  of 
cloth to handle their most complex daily mathematical functions.

So  without  much more further ado,  here we go with a  'Maggie  Awards 
1999'  type  of  thing,  but made to go right back  across  the  years. 
Thought you'd understand. Good.

 Biggest single factor ever that made us all go "Oooh!" 
Atari Corp,  of course. From their earliest days doing the bat and ball 
thing, right through to the ST range and beyond, we all sat up and paid 
very close attention to what they were doing, even those people who are 
fashionably  cynical  about them in the latter days.  This was  a  love 
affair that was very hard to give up!

 Biggest single factor ever that made us all go "Gawwd!" 
Atari Corp,  when they made mistakes, it really set your teeth on edge! 
The  constant changing of directions and thrashing about between  half-
successful strategies assumed a desperate air in the final days.
 
Single  confirmed sign of life from an otherwise quiescent  Atari  Corp 
marketing department.
 "Power  without the Price!" - Still a slogan to reckon with  all  those 
years later.

 Best computer/console hardware ever that Atari made..   (AND WHY!) 
It's personal bias time here. These are my rankings, no-one elses. This 
also  has  to take into account my experience with  the  8-Bit  (800XL) 
family is extremely limited. Here we go...

1. Falcon '030 - Still holding up well.
2. STe - Very close to Amiga performance, too few realised at the time.
3. STFM - The gold-plated original ST.
4. Jaguar - Could have been a contender?
5. 800XL series - More capable in some respects than the ST?
6. 2600 console - Started it all for many people.

Others,  such  as  Mega  STe,  TT etc,  are fine machines,  but lacking 
an essential personality, and come up as also-rans.

 Don't mention the fact that Atari ever made these! 
A PC, with an Atari badge? Disgraceful, but true. This was when 386 was 
the cutting edge? What possessed them?
 
Stuff  that Atari didn't quite manage to make,  but we'd have loved  to 
have seen it!
 The  Falcon  '040,  Atari  Microbox,  The  STFM with a  super-duper  FM 
synthesis sound-chip that was mentioned as missing in action in an  old 
edition  of  'ST-News',   the  transputer  add-on  card,   the  top-end 
transputer  work-station,  the Jaguar VR Headset,  the Panther Console, 
Jaguar  II,  any  likelihood  of  a computer using  the  Jaguar  custom 
chipset?

 Single best 'spur of the moment' hardware feature on TOS computers. 
MIDI ports,  wonderful glorious MIDI ports.  I've never (as yet) played 
or sequenced a musical instrument through them, only played a couple of 
MIDI-networked games through them, but the fact they were put in, means 
that  bog-standard STs still survive as the simple reliable  choice  of 
many music studios today!
 
Most underrated bit of hardware.
 The Motorola 68881/2 series maths coprocessors.  People got them,  with 
some  sort of vague ambition to do some raytracing,  then they promptly 
forgot about it. Fortunately for us, DHS didn't, so the good old co-pro 
is coming back to life as an essential demo fixture. 

This  managed  to beat the blitter,  as seen on STe and  Falcon  series 
computers, into second place.

 Most annoying persistent firmware bug going down the generations. 
Have they managed to get rid of the soft reset 'stuck key' click on the 
newer clones?  How that managed to survive from TOS 1.0 machines,  down 
to the Falcon suggests an amazing lapse of concentration at Atari HQ!

 Top computer of all time, including non-Atari nominations. (And why?)
 Personal preferences stuffed inelegantly into a ranking system again..

1. Sinclair ZX81, my FIRST computer!
2. Atari ST series, my longest lasting computer.
3. Atari Falcon '030, see (2) above.
4. Elan Enterprise, good looking machine, great soundchip!
5. Acorn BBC Model B computer, well there's Elite!
6. Mac Classic (128k), the first GUI I ever saw!

Also mentioned for being well-liked at the time,  are Commodore 64,  ZX 
Spectrum (48K,  I never got into the 128k version at all),  Sinclair QL 
(rudely  displaced by the newly-launched mono 'Jackintosh' ST as  'most 
coveted hardware' in the mid-eighties, when I was a skint student. Also 
Amstrad  CPC,  which did manage to get some half-decent,  for the 8-Bit 
era,  games for it. Strangely enough, although they are everywhere now, 
the Wintel PC comes nowhere in this list.  It is not a concept that you 
can  associate  warm feelings with.  The best thing about  the  current 
generation of PC's perhaps, is that they can emulate most of the others 
above with ease? 
 
Scene teams and demo crews down the years, the best, and why? 
These are a widely ranging group,  right from the early years,  through 
to more recent times.  Again,  a certain amount of personal bias creeps 
in here, I'm all sure you've got your own views on the subject.

Pre-1990,the ST News team, the original 'scene diskmag' back when there 
was  hardly  any scene at all.  The Exceptions,  the first demo  super-
group, The Carebears, need I say any more about them?

Early Nineties, The Lost Boys, peaked with Maggie, Mindbomb, Ooh Crikey 
etc,   Delta  Force,   prime  movers  in  German  scene  at  the  time, 
Overlanders, Next, established great French scene traditions. many many 
others,  don't feel offended if you're not mentioned here,  there isn't 
sufficient room in Maggie for you all!

Mid-Nineties,  Falcon started coming in, so Lazer, EKO, two of the best 
there,  Avena bubbling under. Synergy clinging on for the ST. Reservoir 
Gods started to be a force in games coding.

To the present, Avena/Tat, for Sono', still the greatest DSP based demo 
on the Falcon.  Dead Hackers Society/Evil, simply the internet kings of 
all time,  Cream and Checkpoint rocking the ST still!. The whole Polish 
scene!

 Let's get down to it, best demos by machine, and why? 
STFM,  classic era,  The Exceptions B.I.G.  demo, tons of groovy tunes, 
and  that  digi-sound section that *sometimes* worked correctly  on  my 
machine!  Union  Demo,  first 'proper' multi-part with game-style menu. 
Cuddly  demos *ALL TIME FAVOURITE!* Qualitative leap into  contemporary 
Amiga effects, plus hours of fun, plus genuine 'blow peoples socks off' 
screens!!  Also,  Mindbomb  demo,  another  'biggie',  and  effects that 
scornfully ignorant Amiga owners had previously declared impossible for 
an ST at the time.

STe,  also  going  back a few years,  Scoopex conversion,  by the Pixel 
Twins,  (mostly) perfect port of a famous Amiga demo,  Brain Damage, by 
Aggression, still not really surpassed yet.

Falcon,  EKO  'R  U Experienced',  and EKO 'System demos.  Super-smooth 
presentation,  and fantastic flat-shaded 3D,  Laser 'Lost Blubb', Amiga 
dance video style demo tribute comes off brilliantly!  Sonoluminescenz, 
still the best for DSP 3D? '4Ever 4ktro', the ultimate 4k intro, by the 
Dead Hackers Society.  'Dream Dimension', also by DHS, tunnels, lots of 
tunnels, beautifully executed design.

ST/STe.  recent  work,  Cream  'Do Things',  new maturity of design and 
presentation, Checkpoint 'Suretrip', can the ST really do this? Syntax, 
'Sometimes  Bumblebee  flies higher than Falcon,  pipped Suretrip  with 
their  stunning  texturemapping  on  an  ST.   Nostalgic-O  demo,   the 
Overlanders return, the rest of it pretty damn cool too!

And, they say, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

 Most fabled 'missing' production, games and entertainment dept.. 
1. 'H2O', by EKO, no-one was ever quite sure what the game was?

2.  Willies Adventures,  the one seen most of by us in some early form, 
but still waiting for it.

3. 'Republic', by the Res Gods, again, a case of stalling almost on the 
finishing line?

4.  Obsession  Falcon,  the  256 colour version of the famous STe game. 
Unique  Developments turned up with something differently  titled,  but 
suspiciously similar,  a little while later on the PC. The source disks 
for this, may well still be lost in the post!

As far as we know, none of the above have ever been formally cancelled, 
but are still stuck in development limbo?

 Most fabled 'missing' production, serious department. 
1. Apex Media 2, Apex Audio, ST version of Apex Media. Fascinating tale 
of early development versions being seen at Atari shows in the UK,  but 
after  Black  Scorpion  and Titan went  their  separate  ways,  nothing 
further?

2.  Falcon  synthesiser  emulation  via the DSP.  Just how  many  half-
finished versions are there out there?!

3.  DSP  modem,  Falcy  DSP emulating the modem dialtones,  did this get 
anywhere?

Again, apart from the Apex series, where we have got a pretty good idea 
what  happened,   the  above  just  faded  away  without  any  sort  of 
explanation?

You might also note these are very much Falcon biased entries (grin!)

 The Best Diskmag, down the ages.   
This  may sound a little unhealthily like blowing our own trumpet,  but 
most  objective long-term observers would agree,  this boils down to  a 
two-way  contest between Maggie and ST News.  ST News was the  original 
'scene  magazine',  but  managed  to  go way beyond  this,  picking  up 
plaudits  and international recognition from the 'grown-up' or  serious 
end of the Atari scene. There is also the little matter of longetivity, 
as  they  managed  to turn in a full decade,  and apart from  a  little 
tiredness with the 'ST' end of things,  ended pretty well. Maggie, well 
it started off famously, and sort of tailed off thereafter (grin!)  

There is also the issue of some kind of long-service award here too? ST 
News  were great with the ST,  but never really properly understood the 
Falcon,  Maggie  were more confident with the later Atari machines.  It 
really  is that difficult to award 'first' and 'second' rankings,  so I 
leave  you  with a mental picture of the two diskmags,  clutching  each 
others throats at the top of a precipice,  in an eternal struggle which 
no-one  will ever win!   (But our   relations with each other were nothing 
like that! I might add!)
 
There  were  a  great many other good diskmags,  which  may  have  been 
stronger,  say technically,  or in other individual areas,  than either 
Maggie,  or  ST News,  but none of them were able to beat their overall 
performance and quality. Such illustrious contributors, such as DBA/FUN 
magazine,  Undercover,  Toxic, Eye on the Scene, Ledgers, Stosser,  and 
many others, are all remembered with gratitude. 
 
The  most  useless disk/paper mag over the years.
 A reverse accolade, fortunately, no-one from the 'scene' side qualifies 
for this one.  It is to the mainstream publishing industry, we now turn 
to  announce  that  the only Atari diskmagazine that was  sold  in  the 
shops, under the name of 'Stampede' wins this one by a country mile! 

It  seemed to be a good idea at the time,  and may well have succeeded, 
if you overlooked the lame shell, the lack of decent articles, the lack 
of   any  articles in some issues?  There was also a problem with an  in-
house  style that struggled to get to 'insipid'.  The only thing it had 
going for it,  were the freebie giveaway games on one of the disks, and 
the demos of newer games,  for those people who didn't have alternative 
sources of supply.  It isn't surprising to anyone,  that it lasted less 
than a year, and went under owing rather a lot of money! 

A  special  mention  has  to go to the  defunct  but  (in)famous  paper 
magazine 'ST Format', a bit unfairly perhaps, as it was around for such 
a long time, but it definitely experienced some bad patches. These were 
most  notably under the somewhat rocky editorship of Paula 'give  me  a 
clue' Richards,  who combined a complete lack of technical nous, with a 
tabloid  sensationalist  approach  on the lines  of  "Software  copying 
equals rape!" (So, home video taping equals genocide then?!)

This decline continued with her successor,  Trenton Webb,  who wasn't a 
bad bloke himself,  but had an unfortunate tendency to attract complete 
arseholes  on work experience to write for him!  The editors  following 
him,  Karen  Levell,  and  Nick  Peers,  did their best to reverse this 
unfortunate legacy, but it was too late! The rot had gone too far!

 My personal Favourite Issue of Maggie. 
This  really  has  to be the fifth birthday issue,  issue  18.  Special 
because  it was the fifth anniversary,  and we all made a extra effort. 
It  marked  the  debut of the Falcon shell,  and set the tone  for  how 
'later  period'  issues  of Maggie would go.  The party  that  sprawled 
between my flat in Rushden, and the nearby Rilton Hotel (which is still 
around, but only just...) would be very hard to forget too!

 Most memorable debut in Maggie by an individual contributor. 
In  amongst a bunch of pretty well informed and written stuff in  issue 
three,  or was it four,  from one Leon O'Reilly,  there was a short and 
amusing story which wickedly ripped the piss from A.N.Cool,  one of the 
most famous scene figures of the day.  It is believed that Anders never 
really  lived  down the allegations of sexual healing between  him  and 
Flossie the sheep!

A  2nd prize nomination goes to Felice and his issue 10 debut, where we 
learned  perhaps a little bit too much about the inner mental  workings 
of the angry young man from Keysoe!

 Single most significant personality on the Atariscene (current). 
The  nice thing about the Atari Scene,  past and present,  is that even 
for its 'small' size,  there are too many significant people on it, for 
any one person or group to have an overwhelming influence.  Having said 
that,  I  might  nominate  Evil of the Dead Hackers  Society,  for  his 
unceasing good work in the present day.

Someone said "He is like a father to the whole scene." But I'm sure, if 
I  tried to ask him to read me a bedtime story,  he would teach me some 
new and interesting Swedish swear words!

 The most controversial personality on the Atariscene? 
This  one  is hard to pin down to one overwhelming winner,  as  several 
names bobbed up there,  all demanding attention,  and threatening legal 
action if they didn't get it!  I could go on all night, but in the end, 
I had to trim the list ruthlessly. Here they are, the creme de la creme 
of those folk who didn't go gently into the dark night! 

 Sam   Tramiel ,   the  nearest  to  a  nomination  that  could  have  an 
overwhelming influence.  Daddy Jack T,  built up a business (Commodore) 
from  nothing,  then he rescued another business (Atari) from oblivion. 
After  the shrewed initial moves made by him,  he passed the day to day 
running of Atari to his siblings, particularly eldest son Sam. With Sam 
in  the  driving seat,  it turned out that Jack had only postponed  the 
final closing date of Atari after all!

 Stosser ,  aka  Tony Greenwood,  a prolific contributor to the forces of 
good,  with  his  many  productions such as the  Stosser  diskmag,  his 
various games, and freely given assistance to many other people needing 
his  help.  This picture is clouded by his tendency to be dogmatic  and 
eventually  fall  out  with his partners in  any  given  Atari  related 
enterprise.  His latter days were noted more for picking arguments with 
remaining  members  of  the  serious  side  of  the  Atari  scene,  and 
expressing  personal  dislikes,  than anything more meaningful.  Sadly, 
this threatens to wipe out the memory of his earlier achievements?

 Moondog ,  the  man  who  put the term 'melancholic'  into  fashion  for 
diskzine editors,  just ask ST Survivor,  who seems to be being claimed 
by the 'curse of Moondog' since he took over Undercover Magazine?

An individual active on the underground circuit in the early  nineties,  
 Ruthless ,  suddenly  became  the most hated person there,  for  reasons 
which I hope someone closer to that part of the scene than myself,  can 
advise further?

 Strangest personality on Atariscene.   
Easy  cop-out answer coming up...  Well,  we're all a bit strange to be 
here in the first place!

 Biggest gaffe or mis-saying ever. 
'The  Scene  Sucks',  so said Delta Force in issue 10 of  Maggie.  With 
(de)motivational  skills  peculiar to a small minority of  Germans  (hi 
Moondog!)  They did their best to tell us that the fat lady  had  sung, 
and  there really wasn't any point in caring about the Atari Scene  any 
more. This was in 1992? And here we still are now!

Allied to that was the interesting subtext 'The French scene is full of 
lamers'.  Again,  this  was  shown  to  be the ravings of an  idiot  by 
subsequent  events,  so they can retrospectively take that one back and 
shove it up their EKO System!

A  well-deserved 2nd prize goes to ST Format in its  unfortunate  Paula 
Richards  days,  when  they  decided that a new model  of  Falcon,  the  
1.44mb  RAM consumer model,  was well-placed to compete with the  basic 
model of the A1200 Amiga!

 Most irritating saying on the Atariscene, ever. 
"The scene is dead/dying/fading/stuck on a liferaft in the Atlantic  in 
midwinter!"  Said  far too often,  and far too prematurely to have  any 
impact or meaning anymore.  Usually spoken to mean "When  I'm   gone, the 
scene is finished!" by the egotistical commentator concerned. Guys, why 
not get a fresh prophecy of doom for the new millenium please!

 Who were the winners of the great 'ST vs Amiga' war? 
Erm,  no-one  really,  we  both  lost out to the PC in the end.  It  is 
interesting to note that the old arguments are recently resurfacing  on 
the   Atari.org  emulation forums,  which can be summed up  as  various 
Amiga  people   exhuming  the cold and rotted remains,  and  trying  to 
reanimate  them  into  a   posture of life.  A  pointless,  stupid  and 
unworthy pasttime for grown people.

It  hardly  needs to be added,  that the Atari scene are a  much  nicer 
group of people than the other lot!

There were examples of this, even as recently as last November's ACC at 
Stafford,  a couple of people were touring the show, and looking at the 
Atari  Village in a sneering disparaging fashion.  These were  probably 
the sort of people who Œ*used*  to own Amigas, but now have a PC instead!

We're looking at the sort of mentality that aspires to reach the  giddy 
intellectual heights of 'road-kill'!  Sadly,  these sort of deluded and 
disorganised  vermin were very common on the local Amiga scene  at  one  
time.

Add  to  that,   things  like  general  anti-social  behaviour,  firmly 
documented  at  various coding parties,  IRC 'take-over' attempts,  the 
early   evolution of the Amiga as the platform of choice  for  computer 
virus's  (Virii?).   We  must conclude that,yes,  there are nice Amiga 
people out there, but they all seem to be a silent voice!

 Best fiver spent, ever. 
Not  a  fiver exactly (5ukp),  but whatever small amount of  mony  that 
changed hands for that first issue of Maggie, it surely pointed a large 
chunk of my life in a firm direction, for far longer than I'd imagine.

 Best utility ever. 
My faithful companion down the years,  from day one of the first STFM I 
owned,  right  through  to  this  moment in time.  1st Word,  that  old 
obsolete warhorse word processor from GST Holdings ½ 1985.  Used purely 
as  a  text  creation engine.  It must say something  meaningful  about 
attachment to old things, or the fact that if you really have something 
to  say,  then it doesn't matter what knobs and fancy features you cram 
on  a  word  processor,  the brain/keyboard relationship  is  the  most 
important one at the end of the day.

 Best music product, ever. 
This goes to Noise Tracker,  Protracker,  Audio Sculpture and all their 
kind.  Hours of entertainment as I discovered I couldn't really compose 
music for toffee. Even more hours of entertainment listening to the far 
superior efforts of others.

 All-Time Hero. 
Anybody  who has struck out with a completely new idea,  in an  unknown 
direction.  One  of  the  problems of the current Wintel  PC  dominated 
computing era,  is that it is far too safe and unexciting. I mean, what 
sane person can get worked up into a lather of excitement over the same 
model as before,  only a bit faster, bigger hard disk etc? This is what 
we're stuck with though!

I wish the makers of Milan,  and whatever Centek are doing now, all the 
very best!

 Single biggest enemy of the Atari Scene. 
Amazingly,  not Microsoft,  or PC hardware, which has been successfully 
met head-on, and adapted to, in all sorts of different ways.

It is instead the sheer lack of spare time, as most projects are now on 
a  'as and when' basis.  The amount of free time alloted by  employers, 
family,  and  life  in general seems to get less and less.  I have  the 
feeling that the Atari scene will never ever die, but a lot of projects 
will  still  be awaiting completion,  when the people concerned are  on 
their death-beds at some far distant point in the future!

It  is  hoped  that the Milan,  and the Phenix,  if it turns  up,  will 
provoke  some  revival  in a commercial  Atari  Software  scene,  where 
releases are merely delayed for months instead of years!

 All-Time villain on any computer scene. 
Bill Gates.  Nothing much more has to be said.  he's miles ahead of all 
the  other candidates.  Lots of other people,  including the US Supreme 
Court would agree with me.

 Competitor Misfortune, most hilarious. 
It could have been those old rivals Commodore going bust. It could even 
have been Sega losing money, when it was at its height and throwing too 
much  weight  around.  However,  it is my great pleasure to announce  a 
great  contemporary  winner,  that US Supreme Court  judgement  against 
those good sports, Microsoft!

 Best Computer show ever. 
There are far too many to chose from in this category.  Thinking really 
hard,  you  can't  beat your first ever big computer show,  which in my 
case  was  the 1985 PCW show,  which took place even before I got  into 
Atari. I went to see the Elan Enterprise stand and wowed at the amazing 
(for back then) conversion of 'Sorcery' on that machine!  Second place, 
was  the first Goodmans show at Birmingham,  where we exhibited as  the 
Maggie  Team  for  the first time,  and managed  a  successful  on-time 
release of Maggie issue 21!

The  Top foreign show or party,  ALT Party,  by a whisker ahead of EIL, 
mainly because of the extremely memorable post-party 'chill-out' sauna!

 Dead and Back again special award. 
To the author of Pacifist,  and all other ST emulators on the PC. It is 
amazing how much interest and renewed support from people thought  long 
gone, came out of the skirting board when these were released.

 Single most significant factor that changed the way we use computers. 
The  internet,  promoted  survival of even the most beleaguered  non-PC 
computers. It allows diversity and community to flourish, and speeds up 
news  transmission  a hundred-fold over the old brown  padded  envelope 
days.

 Who ate all the Pizza? 
Possibly Baggio did?

 Summing it all up, just a simple, single phrase. 
‰Given dedication, nothing is impossible! 

 Summing it all up, just one word? 
"Heeey!" (Thanks, MSG.)
