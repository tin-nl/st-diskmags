                 A Super Mario Game clone thing in 4k!

                            Falcon '030 only  

We  have  the  misguided  genius of PeloW of TOYS  to  thank  for  this 
priceless little goldmine of a game.

The  story  goes,  he  was  taking time out from  a  bigger  unfinished 
project,  their  'Grubs'  game,  and  came  up with this in  a  'coders 
armistice' awayday.

Anyway, it is a fully functioning single level of a Super Mario game in 
4096 bytes, actually, around 15-16k uncompressed, which is still a good 
result.  Graphics  and design are thanks to a team effort by PeloW  and 
AIO. The graphics are simplistic but sweet, and no worse than any other 
Mario  adaptation for Atari.  The central character 'DB' possibly  more 
appealing  than the rather too deriviative 'Stario' version from  Power 
Software.

To  look  at,  the  game is a classic Mario knock-off,  at least  in  a 
generic  level  design sort of way.  Blocks and watery chasms  are  the 
order  of  the  day here,  and hostile bugs and hedgehogs  have  to  be 
skipped over, or jumped upon.

Where  there is a Nintendo-hassle avoiding twist,  is in the design  of 
the main character. Mario, the friendly plumber, is replaced by DB, the 
lonely extra-terrestrial. To look at, you think, 'great, more copyright 
hassles!',  but  somehow,  you  know that no-one who gives a sh*t about 
that  is looking in this direction.  so,  your enjoyment of this little 
game remains happily unimpeded.

The game itself, nudges on the 'hard' side of things. Not unplayable or 
frustrating  'hard',  I might add,  but tough enough not to make this a 
single  session pushover.  DB's jumping powers are handsomely  powerful 
 and pretty controllable when in mid-jump. The collision detection, when 
leaning over the edge of a block, is very tolerant. There is a nice (or 
nasty!)  little skiddy inertia factor built in too,  and as quite a lot 
of the in-game objects are mobile/sharp/nasty in varying  combinations, 
you do have to be pretty careful in certain crucial spots.

Add  to  that some 8-bit classic style timing hassles,  and you have  a 
game which isn't going to be beaten that quickly.

For  those  people   really   into this game,  the source code  has  been 
included, if you want to design your own levels.

Overall,  it  is  a  neat and compact production,  way outreaching  its 
diminutive file stature.
