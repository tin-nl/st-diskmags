                                 Part 2!
 
My first proper week at camp I met my first batch of kids.  With me was 
Adonis,  an  18  year  old guy who came from one of  the  Florida  Keys 
islands. 

We  had  a fairly small number of kids in with us,  which  made  things 
friendlier in cabin number 10,  which we were all sharing.   One of the 
most popular kids was Adam, a tall 12 year old who, to start with, used 
to alarm us by making strange noises.   After chatting to Clayton,  who 
was  his half brother,  it turned out Adam was in fact completely  deaf 
and  could  not speak.   This was unusual,  seeing as our camp did  not 
really  have any kids with disabilities,  and Clayton was proficient in 
sign language,  which helped me to translate to Adam or to hear what he 
would say.

As the week went on,  the friendships built between the kids,  and as I 
spent  time  to  play  games with them,  usually  playing  baseball  or 
basketball  which they were much better at than me,  mainly as it  took 
quite while for me to get used to 75 degrees plus weather. When you are 
in  a large tarmacked playing field with no shade,  for more than three 
quarters of an hour, this can be a bit much to say the least.

Adam really demonstrated skill overcoming his lack of hearing, by being 
an  excellent clown and mimic.   In similar fashion to Harpo Marx,  the 
mute  member of the Marx brothers,  he would copy me or the other kids, 
after  the initial odd reaction from the other 13 kids in our  hut,  he 
soon became well respected and was great fun.

I  began to notice the differences in the social behaviour  of  British 
and American children.   American kids are more reliant on role models, 
and  I noticed most of the young black kids tend to shave  their  heads 
and  want  to be like Will Smith,  or a basketball player like  Michael 
Jordan.  Frequently  the  kids won't dare to be individual for fear  of 
being a geek, or some other colloquialism for social outclass.  

Americans  in general are more emotional people and aren't  embarrassed 
about   showing  affection  for  their  friends,   and  other  ways  of 
demonstrating appreciation (or the opposite feelings) for each other.

The  first  week  went quite quickly and whilst I was  going  about  my 
duties  mopping  the wooden floors outside one of chalets,  I  heard  a 
strange noise, which vaguely sounded like 'John'.  There was a van full 
of  kids  driving towards out of the entrance of the camp.   There  was 
Adam, he was saying goodbye.  I waved for a brief minute and carried on 
my work.   I had brought some postcards of HMS Victory, The Warrior and 
the  Mary Rose ships at Portsmouth Dockyard Museum with me.   The  kids 
seemed  fascinated that I live in an 800 year old city in the south  of 
England, which up till then, I had taken for granted.

The  kids  varied  greatly in their behaviour.   One of  the  Community 
Service  weeks  we did was for kids from poor backgrounds who  had  the 
Salvation Army providing the money for them to afford to go to camp.  

The week with those kids who were 12/13 years old were the worst.  They 
were a total nightmare and each evening I soon ran out of patience  and 
ideas  to keep them under control.   The next week I had some 7/8  year 
olds who were angels.  Every evening we had canteen time,  and no, this 
was not an actual meal,  but another name for the tuck shop.  The great 
thing  about  this  was all the counsellors were  allowed  free  candy, 
(sweets)  soda (fizzy pop) and ice cream.   Which was nice.   One quite 
amusing  incident which happened were that a lot of the  swimming  pool 
staff  all decided to dye their hair blonde with this  peroxide  stuff.  
When they next went in the pool, the chlorine in the water reacted with 
the peroxide giving them green hair!

A particularly memorable time at camp was when 75 kids got out of their 
seats  and  gave  their lives to God.   This was  an  extremely  moving 
moment, for when I saw 6 of my lads from inner cities from Florida join 
in. It is very satisfying listening and encouraging these children when 
they  look at you as a bigger brother.   As Keystone camp is run by the 
Salvation  Army,  Christianity is strong in the ethos of the camp,  and 
even if you are a hardened atheist,  you will find hard to disagree, as 
this helps the kids from their varying backgrounds.

At  the  end of each week the kids would depart on  Saturday  mornings, 
which  required  all the staff to co-operate (the Americans  like  that 
word,  have  you  seen Sesame Street?) in cleaning up the  whole  camp, 
scrubbing  floors  and walls.  This by far the was the least  desirable 
job, especially cleaning out the rest rooms.  

By  lunch time this was all done and we could relax,  make friends with 
someone  with a car,  and go to Gainsville or Orange Park shopping mall 
and maybe catch a movie.   I saw the 'Truman Show',  which although has 
received rave reviews by most people, was the most pointless and boring 
film  I have ever seen.   I also saw 'Saving Private Ryan' which was an 
extremely  realistic,  but  grim and depressing war film going  on  for 
about 3 hours,  Afterwards, I realised that I really didn't want to see 
this in a place with a cheerful and sunny climate.

The last week.   It seemed amazing that we had been there 7 weeks.   As 
the  last  week  was entirely a girls camp,  all the  male  staff  were 
assigned  to  doing maintenance duties,  me and Gordon were put in  the 
kitchen along with 4 of the American staff.   It was then whilst trying 
to erect a large heavy cast iron table with folding legs that one  side 
gave  way  and  came  crashing down on my  foot.   After  a  minute  of 
screaming,  swearing and hopping around in circles,  I manage to hobble 
to  the nurse's station,  where surprisingly she just gave me a bag  of 
ice and told me to lie down and rest.   

No chance of the local hospital checking to see if I had any  fractures 
which  is what I expected,  the next day I decided to get back to  work 
although  I was in pain,  as I didn't want my colleagues to think I was 
shirking.

One  night  Gordon decided he had enough of sharing a  cabin  with  two 
other guys who legendary snorers.  As the evening was dry and it wasn't 
too  hot,  he  decided to sleep outside on a bench.   In the morning he 
discovered he was covered in insect bites.  I caught sight of a big one 
on  his  upper arm whilst doing my kitchen duties,  "shouldn't you  get 
that one seen to?" I asked.   "No,  no I'll be fine" and he carried one 
drying  the  large aluminium dish we were putting away.   During  lunch 
time after various other people had noticed, he reluctantly went to the 
nurses  hut.   The  nurse took one look at him,  put him in her car and 
drove  him to the hospital at high speed.   Alarmingly he came back  in 
the evening with a drip sticking out of his arm.  

During that week there was a tree a few yards away from Gordon, Ray and 
Nathan's  cabin,  which  had a huge spider on the bark which must  have 
been 6 or 7 inches long.

Weird things American kids have said to me:-

1.      You come from that country called London don't you?

2.      Isn't Paris the capital of Britain?

3.      Have you got a mansion and a Rolls Royce?

4.      I like your accent.

5.      Do you know the Queen?

6.      Why is it UK,  Australia and New Zealand are the only countries 
        in the world stoopid enough to drive on the left?

7.      John, why have you got a badly sewn up rip in your pants? (me:)
        er, its a long story. (see my article 3 issues ago about my 
        accident.)

8.      Do British people say the word F(there were many other strange 
        questions asked.


Morning on Monday 11th August 1998,  and me, Gordon and Ray and some of 
the  girls,  packed our stuff into the U-Haul trailer which attached to 
the back of the Ford V8 truck that was taking us south.

Once we heading off, it was great to relax, get some sleep or listen to 
some  of the mostly R&B music being played on the local radio  station.  
My foot wasn't hurting too much,  besides I was too excited travelling, 
I would have quite happily hobbled around the southern part of Florida.

Great music that reminds of my trip:-
  Under the bridge - Red Hot Chilli Peppers
  Time of your life - Green day
  Every breath you take - Puff Daddy
  Don't want to lose you - Aerosmith

Travelling  down  the 95 highway which takes you down the  entire  East 
coast of Florida state southwards, we saw some amazing scenery although 
most of Florida is completely flat.  You see a lot of the old buildings 
built  in  the 30s,  as well as some tatty old gas stations,  and large 
posters advertising surfing shops, Cadillacs and fast food drive-ins.

I  started  to notice,  whilst I was half asleep,  that the scenery was 
getting  more built up looking.  We had got to West Palm Beach,  it was 
hard  to  realise we had actually travelled around 400 miles  since  we 
left camp.  

We  all said goodbye to Ray as he dropped outside of a church close  to 
where  he  lived,  and then it was back on the Highway for  another  30 
miles  to Fort Lauderdale.   Whilst in McDonalds I picked up a brochure 
on  accommodation in the south coast of Florida,  any branch of  Macky-
Dee's  in  Florida can provide you with one of the these,  which  makes 
planning travelling easy.

Not long later we got to Fort Lauderdale.  Located 25 miles from Miami. 
This city is also very big and is very diverse in its mixture of people 
from different ethnic backgrounds and classes.

Our  first day in FL (By 'FL' I am referring to Fort Lauderdale  rather 
than Florida,  as Americans commonly abbreviate states to the first two 
0letters  as  used in postal zip codes) did not start off well.  Me  and 
Gordon  did not plan our journey before hand,  and so we looked at  the 
brochure  that  mentioned some of the most popular hotels in  FL.   The 
cheapest  one was a Days Inn hotel who are a big chain group  who  have 
hotels  all over the United States.  Seeing as this one was $37 a night 
we  wondered why it was far away from all the other hotels  which  were 
dotted on the map.  It did not take long to find out why.

We  booked  in for one nights stay,  by a woman in an office,  and were 
given a magnetic card to open the door rather than a key.  Our room had 
been  left in a state from the last occupants and had not been  cleaned 
at all.  The grim looking soulless block of rooms overlooked a car park 
with  a  large skip full of some tree cuttings.  Outside I  could  hear 
local city kids playing. 

Unlike  British hotels,  I discovered that American hotels never bother 
with  tea  and coffee making facilities,  which is a bit  disappointing 
when  you fancy a bit of brew after travelling.   Rather than complain, 
we  decided to rest for a short time after the long journey.   After an 
hour,  we  ventured out to explore the area and walking down the street 
we  seem to be in the middle of a ghetto area with very little  in  the 
way  of anything geared towards tourists.  In fact,  the more we walked 
and  the later the evening came,  we realised this place was  downright 
DANGEROUS! a total no-go for tourists.

I was relieved when we found a Burger King restaurant, the only vaguely 
welcoming place I had seen that afternoon amongst the sleazy nightclubs, 
tatty garages, and liquor stores which gave this place an uncomfortable 
atmosphere.

Popular American sports:-

  Basketball

  American Football

  Baseball

  Obesity

Half and hour and a combo meal and shake later; we decided to head back 
to  the hotel,  it was nearly 8pm.   I was about to take out my wallet, 
then  I quickly pushed it back in to my jeans,  as we started to notice 
drunks  and drug users roaming around.   I was wearing a very  brightly 
coloured shirt,  so I might as well been wearing a hat with a neon sign 
attached with "Tourist with lots of money" displayed.   I see some kids 
skateboard  pass,  the  some  other  kids  were  shouting,  Gordon  was 
wondering  if it was aimed at someone behind us or US.   We decided  to 
quicken our pace.  It was a big relief to get back in our hotel.  After 
this episode,  I wanted our number one priority for finding a hotel was 
for it to be in a safe area rather than very cheap.

The next day we got the woman in the office to get us a taxi to another 
hotel along the beach.  The Polynesian hotel only cost $40 a night with 
a  voucher that we had for it.   This was great as it was such a  small 
extra  cost  over  the appalling place we had just been  to.   When  we 
arrived, it was beautiful, we had free breakfast and use of a pool, the 
room  had  a balcony which overlooked a large palm tree,  and we  could 
walk in relative safety down the main road and easily get to shops  and 
the  beach.   This was the tourist "honey pot" part of Fort  Lauderdale 
and  some  of the beauty of the place still holds in my  mind.  Walking 
along the beach without shoes burns your feet as it is so hot.

We set off in the morning to get a taxi to the Greyhound bus station. I 
wanted  to cut down on using taxis,  as paying $7-10 plus tip  depleted 
our  money rapidly.   I was pleasantly surprised to see it only cost us 
$3  a  ticket  to get to Miami.   I would  definitely  recommend  using 
Greyhound to go anywhere in the US as they are so cheap, you can travel 
from state to state or from east to west coast if you like.

As  soon as we got off the bus we were confronted by a Latin  gentleman 
who to me he was homeless and offered to carry our bags.   I felt sorry 
for him so I gave him $3,  I notice there were an awful lot of homeless 
people  in  Florida,  and  almost all of them were  of  South  American 
origin.   The people of Miami are split between those who are very rich 
and those who are in extreme poverty.

We stayed in a hotel in Bayside which is at the centre of Miami  beach.  
We  did  not get a chance to explore the beach,  as after we came  back 
from  the  shopping mall it was dark.   Whilst in the malls or  on  the 
beaches we were amazed how many attractive women Miami seems to have!

Facts:

-  60%  of  the population of Miami are  originally  from  Cuba.   This 
includes famous singer Gloria Estafan who is Cuban and lives in  Miami.  
This  is not surprising when you consider Cuba is less than  100  miles 
from the Keys. (Islands on the south coast of Florida)  There is also a 
significant amount of people from the Bahamas which is also  neighbours 
on Florida.

- Miami was founded by the Seminole Indians,  and it gets its name from 
'Mia' meaning important and 'Mi' meaning big.

We  landed in Kennedy airport,  me and Gordon started to wonder what to 
do  next.   It was midnight and we did not want to wander round the Big 
Apple looking for a hotel so we ended up sleeping on a pile of chairs.
We were not alone, seeing as there were 4 or 5 other people in the  same 
predicament.  So me and Gordon took turns in sleeping and looking after 
the bags.

We  were woken up at 5am by two Policemen who wanted us all out as  two 
planes  were landing soon,  which had a lot of people coming this  way. 
When  we  wandered out of the airport we caught sight  of  a  policemen 
whose name tag said Paddy O'Malley,  which made me immediately think of 
the  Irish New York cops in movies!   He gave us directions to find the 
taxi rank.

We  spent  a  lot  of money taking taxi rides  to  different  parts  of 
Manhatten looking for a decent hotel.  The first one I liked but Gordon 
didn't, the second one Gordon liked but I didn't. Both of them were run 
down places run on a shoestring, and seemed to be run by gangsters.  

We  eventually went to the Presidential Hotel near Times  Square  which 
shockingly  expensive but we decided we would be treated well,  what  a 
joke.  Not for the first time, we had the last room in the hotel on the 
16th floor which meant we shared a double bed.   Gordon decided to take 
a  shower only to find the water trickled out pathetically.   We had  a 
rude  cleaning lady who wanted us out because she wanted to  clean  the 
room  when we woke up at 10am,  she made some kind of sarcastic comment 
(which  I don't remember) noting we had a double bed implying  we  were 
gay.  

Reception was called and guy was sent to fix the shower.   Half an hour 
we  were  told it was done.   Again Gordon had a shower but it  stopped 
working  and  he phoned downstairs fuming,  this time we were  given  a 
different room.

Manhattan  is an amazing place.   We decided to visit the Empire  State 
Building.  When we wandered in the main hall,  there was a big crowd of 
people  which we decided to ignore and we walked straight in  the  lift 
which took about 3 or 4 minutes to get up half way.   We had to get out 
and  queue for another lift so we could go up the second half (The  ESB 
narrows at three different places so its necessary to go in the lift in 
two  stages.) This took a little longer.   Once at the top the view  is 
awesome.   Clouds partly obscure bits of the other high buildings,  but 
you can see most of the whole of New York City.

The  Underground  system is strange.   You can't buy a  return  ticket, 
there  is only one ticket available which is $1.50 to go  anywhere  you 
like.   You  buy  a  little token from the counter put it  through  the 
turnstyle and go where you want to go, then buy another one to go back.

My hotel was round the corner from Times Square,  which is a block with 
a  lot of neon signs,  and is certainly one of the most famous parts of 
Manhattan.   It   was  here  when I was reading the  scrolling  message 
banners that I learnt about the Omagh bomb in Northern Ireland,  one of 
the few times that I knew about what was happening at home.

The chauffeur who took us from the hotel to the airport was a joke.  He 
frequently changed lanes without looking, cut people up and swore under 
his breath when someone leant on the horn.  He didn't really seem to be 
used  to  driving the big Lincoln,  which as we travelled through  some 
underpasses  gave me a nervous reminder of the Princess Diana  accident 
almost  a  year previously.   

Eventually  Gordon and I separated at JFK airport,  as he flew back  to 
Glasgow whilst I went back to Heathrow.  Once back at Heathrow I phoned 
my parents and took my last dollar to the exchange booth so I could get 
65p for a cup of tea whilst waiting two hours in the virtually isolated 
arrival lounge.

                               --------

Overall  this  has  an  been amazing  experience  in  both working  and 
travelling around the US.  It has let me experience  a wide  variety of 
people from different cultures and backgrounds,  as well as see some of 
the  beauty  of  Florida's  beaches,  palm  trees,  the  30's  Art Deco 
architecture in some of Fort Lauderdale's old buildings,and the mixture
of different forms of hospitality in America.

It was not possible for me to return in 1999, as  I am now working, but
Gordon went back although he did not enjoy it as much as last year.

THE END.
