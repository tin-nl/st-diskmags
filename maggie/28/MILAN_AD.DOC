                   Milan 060 - Introduction 
                                          
We  are pleased to be able to present to you the ultimate successor  of 
the  Milan040:  The Milan II,  also known as the Milan of the Milan040, 
the  Milan  060  will  impress  many  users  with  its  use  of  modern 
technology,  expensive software pack,  and unbelievably low price.  The 
Milan  060 will first be introduced to the general public at the  CeBit 
2000 and will go on sale shortly after. 
                        
The Milan 060 has built-in USB connectivity,  making it the first Atari 
compatible system in history to take advantage of this ground  breaking 
technology.  This  fast  interface  which  is already  widely  used  on 
Macintosh and PC compatibles, permits users to connect and attach up to 
127  devices!  There is already an immense selection of SB  peripherals 
available, including printers, scanners, webcams etc... 
                              
The Milan 060 will be produced directly by Motorola.  The advantages of 
this  are  obvious:  The Milan 060 can be manufactured at an  unmatched 
level  of  quality while retaining a low price  tag.  Furthermore,  the 
microchips  the  Milan060  will  use  also  originate  from   Motorola, 
increasing the quality even more.
