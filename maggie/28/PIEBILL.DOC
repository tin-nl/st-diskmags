This  unexpected and diverting little game was released at  the  recent 
FUN 'Pre-Millenium Party' (PMP) by the French team, Sector One.

Very  simply,  the  Phantom  Flan-Flinger is roaming the  corridors  of 
Microsoft's  Redwood  GHQ,  with  the sole dastardly aim of  shoving  a 
custard  based confectionary into the unsuspecting face of Bill  Gates, 
the  all  wise  leader  and  great  helmsman  of  reliable  crash-proof 
operating systems. You are that Phantom Flan-Flinger! (Irony mode off.)

Thought you might like the sound of that!

Well,  in translation, this game mutated into a computer version of one 
of those fairground attractions,  where you hit the head of the nearest 
Spice Girl that pops up at random out of a hole in the floor. Here, the 
sledgehammer is replaced by a never-ending stream of custard pies,  the 
head  of Bill Gates pops out at random from one of three spots  on  the 
screen, or even from more than one hole at a time. You have to battle a 
time  limit to accumulate the highest score possible,  with only a deft 
flick of the mouse wrist to help you.

The  pies  fly,  but you can't keep a Bill Gates down for long,  as  he 
willingly  comes back more more dairy produce derived punishment  after 
what  looks like the quickest clean-up in history.  You,  are strangely 
compelled to keep dishing it out to him. This can potentially go on for 
some weeks after the computer has been disconnected,  several dribbling 
survivors  of 'pie-mania' had to be rescued from muttering  "Pie  Bill, 
Pie!" absently at blank monitor screens.

Graphics and sound and general presentation for such a simple game, are 
of a very high standard.  Sector One doing themselves credit here.  You 
even get a choice of soundtracker or super sparkly SID style  soundchip 
music.  This  game  is billed as compatible with just about  everything 
from a standard ST upwards, so why not give it a pie, erm, try.

 (Pie) Ratings... 

 Crustiness - 80% -  Soft but firm, no burnt-on bits here.

 Squishiness - 85% -  Abundant evidence of custard-based material running 
                    down Bill Gates face. Highly commendable.

 Overall Flan - 90% -  Never say Pie!
