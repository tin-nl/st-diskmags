
                          ‰Breaking the Windows?
 
Or, what hope for creative computing from a non-Wintel Platform now?

The big question as the millenium approaches, is can we avoid the ever-
enroaching   steamroller  of  Gates  and  his  glass-housed   operating  
system,which  gives  both  conformity  and  eccentricity  a  bad  name. 
Discussed  below are several options which could still offer some  sort 
of solution to this problem.


 ...Carry on as if nothing wrong with your existing set-up.. 

This is the least expensive and disruptive option for a lot of  people,  
whether it relates to Atari,  Amiga or any other non-PC platform. Other  
advantages would include great familiarity with the existing  platform,  
and  ever  cheaper hardware and software becoming available for  it  as 
time  goes on.

This would be set against an atmosphere of relentless decline. It would  
be very difficult to try to 'carry on as if nothing wrong', as more and 
more  users  migrated to the PC (and such people really  love  to  make 
their  decision in that direction known to all and sundry!) In the end, 
only  a   small  diehard  core  is  left  to  carry  on.  New  software 
development tends  to assume an unwanted sedateness too.

Prospects,  there may well be a plateau in the rate of decline, already  
reached  in the case of the Atari.  There may also be some prospect  of 
revival,  with  small numbers returning disillusioned with the PC as  a 
programming  or  creative  tool,  and   larger numbers  of  people  who 
reappear via emulators running on the PC.


 ...Emulators.. 

These are becoming commonly available on the 'big' platforms such as PC 
and  Mac,  and provide a neat way back in to your favourite computer of  
past  years.  These  are very cheap,  internet downloadable,  and with a 
great  deal  of  enthusiastic support for these.  Many old  and  famous 
'names' on the scene have been remotivated to come back to some  extent  
by  the  emergence of these emulators.  In the best cases,  actual  new 
productions have arisen from the use of these,  such as the 'Do Things'  
and 'Nostalgic-o' demos on Atari.

Against  that,  a lot of people have only come back in for the purposes 
of nostalgia, rehashing the good old days, rather than building on them  
and  coming  up  with  something  new.  Also,  not  all  emulators  are 
technically perfect,  and in the opinion of many, cannot provide a full  
replacement for the real thing.  (In the case of the Falcon,  also non-
existent!)  However,  if you only have desktop space  for one computer, 
they are a lot better than nothing.

Prospects,  likely  to  be  always  with us,  but it is still  an  open 
question how active and enthusiastic the emulator scene is going to  be  
in the longer term?


 ...Hardware add-ons to existing computers.. 

Another popular option, especially for those who are infected with a PC 
style  lust  for performance,  but don't want to ditch  their  existing 
system, is the shadowy world of the hardware add-on.

This  usually takes the form of some kind of system accelerator,  which  
may be combined with more RAM,  bigger and better screen displays, etc. 
The  major advantage,  is a boost in performance,  a big boost with the  
right  accelerator.  This  refreshes  a lot  of  existing  system-legal 
software,  so  what  seemed  to run in a flabby and  uninteresting  way  
previously,  is now zingy and spot on.  If you're very lucky, even some  
games  and  other  less application  orientated  (demo)  software  will 
benefit too.

The downside is,  that such a unit can be costly, and risking damage to 
your  hardware,  if  self-installed.  Most games or demo type  software 
won't  work,  as  it is tightly written to existing hardware,  and 100%  
backward compatibility to the original machine isn't guaranteed.  There 
is  a  smaller base of users and developers to draw  inspiration  from, 
owing to the cost and hassle factor in getting one of these fitted.

Prospects  are  pretty good however,  as more and more loyalist  'core' 
users  will  get  some  form  of accelerator,  even  in  spite  of  the 
disadvantages  outlined  above.  The chances of software  developed  or 
enhanced  for  these  will improve as well as there  is  some  tangible 
demo/games scene interest there.


 ...Higher Spec Clone machines.. 

Otherwise known as 'Send in the Clones?'  Hoo hoo! (argh) 

An increasingly popular route for those people with cash to splash, but 
an  unwillingness to consort with the antichrist Gates.  A higher  spec 
clone machine is a good no-risk route for those people happy with their  
existing  range  of  system-legal software.  Many of the  arguments  in 
favour  of hardware acceleration apply here too,  without the risks  of  
system  death at the hands of an inept self-fitter.  Clone machines can  
be expensive, but the latest generation are getting cheaper, and making  
use of PC type industry standard components too.

But 'system legal' is likely to be even more of a straitjacket on  this 
kind of computer than a hardware accelerator. Almost no games will run,  
unless  specially written,  and with the possible exception of the,  as 
yet unproven Phenix, does not attract much 'scene' interest. A  typical 
user  of  a  higher  spec clone,  may well  disdain  games  or  'scene'  
activities  anyway.  Any  new  software,  even  where  there  is  scene 
interest,  may  well  be  a while in coming,  owing to the  'part-time'  
nature of most development nowadays.

Prospects, too early to tell? At worst, a refuge for the last survivors 
from the ravages of Wintel, but maybe, something more?


 ...Mac attack!.. 

Otherwise  known  as the other mainstream.  Can be considered the  only 
sizeable opposition to the PC, and worth considering for their Motorola  
based heritage.

Like the PC,  it supports a full range of emulation,  including various 
flavours  of Atari,  there is a bigger user base on tap,  and even some  
mainstream games support (remarkable, for what was a fairly consciously  
non-gaming computer.)

In  the  majority of cases,  the Mac still isn't a cheap  option,  iMac 
aside,  and  to  the  majority of people,  still has a staid  non-scene  
image.  (although there is evidence of some activity in that area now?) 
The software tends to fall into the 'non-cheap' camp too,  as a general 
rule.

Prospects,   the  Mac  will  always  be  with  us,  and  misunderstood, 
especially by Apple.


 ...Other hardware platforms.. 

An  extreme option,  only to be contemplated if you are totally fed  up 
with  what  you've got,  or you have too much spare time for  your  own 
good.

These are limited,  but could well take in the new Acorn RISC PC clones 
just  emerging  after the demise of Acorn,  or possibly the new  Amiga, 
whatever  shape  that  takes  (Linux  or  non-Linux,   sir?)  Also,   a 
possibility  with whatever Clive Sinclair comes up with in  the  longer 
term?

A less extreme option is to try out a new O/S if you are lumbered  with 
a PC,  such as Linux, or the Intel version of BeOS, I should be getting  
a  closer  look  at  the latter soon,  and have  had  some  encouraging 
feedback already.

Prospects, hmmm?


. ..Next Gen Console Mutations.. 

There  are  some  potentially interesting  developments  with  the  new 
generation of consoles,  the Dreamcast, and the forthcoming Playstation  
II.  Both will have internet connection as an option,  and there was an  
object  most  profane  to  unabashed  console-philiacs  seen  with  the 
Dreamcast, a keyboard!

Dreamcast  lets  it down again by having Windows CE on there,  but  the 
possibilities  are there?  Playstation II could do much more,  and with  
the addition of some sort of O/S,  and decent permanent storage,  could  
be *the* home computer format of the next decade!

How likely this is to be fully realised,  is a matter for debate.  Sony 
like  to  think they encouraged 'creativity' by the masses  with  their 
Yaroze  Playstation,  but this was still dependent on a host PC to work  
as a developer machine, and as we all know, Sony love corporate lawyers  
even more than their 'artistes'!

Sony  will have to do things they have never done before to shed  their  
console  manufacturer  based notions of 'control'  of  the  development 
process, to allow unrestricted access to Playstation II, allowing  non-
profitmaking  software  to be written on a 'for the sheer  fun  of  it'  
basis.  In  other  words,  to provide the conditions for an independent 
'scene' to evolve.  Taking the experience of Yaroze into account,  this  
is unlikely to ever happen,  but we can hope?

Prospects,  a  keyboard  added to a console,  does not,  a home computer 
make!


 ...(Get a) Girlfriend.. 

A  final  tongue in cheek solution to your  computing  problems.  (Just 
whose tongue in your cheek, I hear you ask!)

A  girlfriend is a temporal vacuum-cleaner,  sucking up all your  spare 
time  that you used to spend worrying on 'whither the scene  tomorrow?'  
type  stuff.  You  may  find some of your hardware  gathering  unwanted 
layers of dust.  Emails go unread,  new stuff only glimpsed in passing.  
On the plus side, sexual relief no longer has to come from going to the  
Nude Raider website!

Prospects,  marriage,  children,  hair loss,  children grow up and turn 
against you,  senile dementia,  become whizz DSP coder in final stages,  
death? A rather compact autobiography, as someone once said!
