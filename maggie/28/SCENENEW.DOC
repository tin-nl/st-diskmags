
                      ‰M a g g i e   N e w s d e s k 

                        All that's fit to print! 
 
Apologies  in  advance,  in  some  kind  of  vain  attempt  to  deflect 
criticism!  It's CiH here, taking over for this issue, what is normally 
done so well by Mr Pink.

Now  he's been having a few problems keeping up with the  movements  of 
the Atari Scene,  mainly to do with the fact that he started a new job, 
as  if the old job wasn't keeping him busy enough!  We discussed  doing 
the newsdesk briefly over the phone,  and he said "Chris,  you've got a 
much  better  grip on the Atari scene than I have at  the  moment,  why 
don't you do it." 

Errm,  thanks,  I thought. So here we are. Can't promise it is going to 
be the greatest scene newsdesk on earth, but I'll do my best....


[] PHENIX FRESHLY (RE)MINTED! []

The Phenix is dead!  Long live the Phenix?  Confused? Thought you might 
be... 

The Phenix in its original and very long awaited form is no more.  This 
was apparently due to a failure of its custom-written operating system, 
Dolmen,  to  arrive.  In  the period just before Xmas,  I was told that 
Phenix was being scrapped,  and efforts were turning to an entirely new 
hardware design,  based around twin G4 PowerPC processors, with a Linux 
front-end.  It  seemed  that Centek's links with the Atari  world  were 
finally over?

However, after some constructive feedback via #Atariscne, the Phenix is 
apparently being revamped,  keeping the base specification,  and option 
of  single  or twin MC68060 processors.  The operating  system  quandry 
being resolved by the adoption of MiNT. The only loss, has been the DSP 
part,  which  may well be available as an add-on.  The really brilliant 
news,  is  that  it has been pared down to a competitive price  of  913 
Euros!  This  would  work out to around 6-700 UKP,  depending on things 
like  VAT,  and it makes an interesting comparison with the forthcoming 
'060 Milan.

The revised specification looks something like this;

  CPU:  Motorola 68060 at 83Mhz, expandable to 2 Motorola 68060 at 83Mhz 
  Local Bus:  32Bit / 83Mhz (Full Speed Bus Mode - 266 MByte/sec) 
  AGP:  1 AGP Slot 3.3V with a ATI Rage Pro graphic card 
  PCI : 5 PCI Slots 3.3/5V - 32Bit / 32 Mhz (132 Mbyte/sec) 
  RAM:   2  DIMMS  for  up to 1GB SDRAM (166 MBytes/sec) or  ESDRAM  (221 
 Mbytes/sec) at 83Mhz  
  Flash:  512 KB 
  USB:  2 USB Ports (1.5 at 12 MBit/sec - PCI Master) 
  PS/2:  2 PS/2 Ports for Mouse and Keyboard 
  IDE (ATA-4) : 2 IDE (UDMA 33) Ports (PCI Master) 
  RTC:  RTC + 256 Bytes NVRAM 
  Case:  Standard ATX 2.1 
  OS:  MiNT and Linux

It  will  also be interesting to see if the proposed  G4  Linux  design 
makes an appearance in the longer term? This design apparently also has 
a  Texas  Instruments  DSP  included,  which will be  capable  of  some 
seriously harmful levels of power on its own!  Personal computer?  More 
like  a  supercomputer  in  a bun,  with fries!!  One  reliable  source 
suggested  that preliminary plans for this were being shown to  a  very 
select few people at the Stafford ACC last November!?

STOP  PRESS!  - You might want to check out the statement from a friend 
of  Rodolphe  Czuba of Centek,  which is the closest and most  detailed 
account of recent events yet in the public domain.  This is to be found 
elsewhere  in Maggie.  This seems to suggest that the near future,  for 
Phenix at least, may be still not be wholly resolved? 


[] BEWARE OF GREEKS WRITING INTROS! (NEW BLOOD!) [] 

Those  of  you currently enjoying the ST version of Maggie,  and  fresh 
from running the intro for it, may well already realise, there are some 
new  kids  in  town.  These are from a part of the world  not  normally 
associated with any meaningful Atari activity. It is our great pleasure 
to bring you KUA, the new Greek stars on the Atari Scene! 

Apart  from taking the time out to produce an intro for us,  they  also 
have  future  plans,  coming soon to an ST(e) near you,  should be  the 
following.

Xmastro, which missed the DHS Xmas competition..
 A 4ktro, based on the theme of Sierpinski triangles, which I've already 
seen a beta of..
 A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up on the lines of 'Flying Shark'..
 Maybe even an update of the ST Maggie shell,  which they said they were 
willing to do!?
  
It  is  always  great to see new blood,  and we look forward  to  their 
future productions with great interest.


[] FIT THEM UP! (MORE NEW BLOOD) []

A  genuine  rarity,  a  new  Falcon demo crew debuts,  with  an  Indian 
flavoured production,  'Mahabharata'.  The crew responsible, 'Fit', are 
from  Finland,  and  have  been around since 1991 as  a  multi-platform 
group.  This is their first release for the Falcon,  and it was done in 
co-operation  with  Sturm,  formerly  of  the  Admirables,  and  Acorn, 
previously of Flash.

Further  Falcon productions,  quite possibly under a new name and  with 
more people involved, are likely.


[] ELECTRONIC IMAGE STILL BRIGHT? []

You  all  remember  Griff  of  EI,  right?  He went away  to  work  for 
Electronic Arts,  and disappeared from the scene. Some people with very 
logn  memories may also remember an  unfinished  demo of his,  shown at 
the Bradford Coding Convention in  1992.  This was never released,  and 
has assumed 'mythical missing megademo' status!

Well,  since  Mr  Pink went down south to work for Bullfrog,  he  found 
Griff again.  Better still,  this mystical missing demo is still on his 
hard drive,  essentially complete, but needing putting together.

We  learn  that Griff is keen to return to ST demo coding  in  general. 
Both  the completion of the EI final demo,  and any future  productions 
depend on 'time permitting',  as he  is very very busy!   He is said to 
have  learned  a lot from his  time working  in  'the  industry',   and 
reckons he could kick out some  really fantastic screens on the ST,  if 
he ever gets the time! But don't hold your breath folks.


[] CREAM TEASE! []

Work  proceeds steadily on their forthcoming ST megademo 'Heftig',  and 
their  generic Amiga chip player 'Jam'.   An initial release version of 
'Jam'  is due 'real  soon now',  Candyman still having to overcome  his 
dislike  of  coding  GEM interfaces and the effects  of  moving  house. 
Meanwhile,  Heftig  will include wild contemporary effects,  some based 
around  PC  3D  studio rendered material,  which  have  been  converted 
successfully to the ST.


[] DHS DON'T REST! []

Nothing  major to hand,  but lots of interesting bits and pieces coming 
real soon from the hyperactive Swedes...

The 3k Graphics competition, well you all know about that one!

Just Musix 4, is still awaiting graphics for its delayed release.

DHS's major efforts are based around their new forthcoming web site and 
FTP  server,  coming later this year.  A new domain has been purchased, 
and  the new site will be very much more feature packed even  than  the 
current  Ludvika site!  Also,  Atari.org is expected to get a refresher 
and bugfixes as well, if things go to plan.

There  is a sequel to the SND Player program being worked on,  with Ozk 
of AssemSoft. This is described as 'something quite nice'!

The 'Dump' module player should gain some more features,  other modfile 
types such as GTK/GT2 to be catered for?

There is no major demo in there at the moment though :(


[] SWEDE DREAMS ARE MADE OF DEEZ! []

I've  really got to apologise for this rash of dismal song lyric  based 
pun titles!

Mind Designs are planning a new Falcon demo for the Sillyventure  2000. 
This is aimed at those lucky owners of Centurbo 2 accelerated  Falcons, 
competition rules permitting?  In any case, a non CT2 'lite' version is 
planned for release at the same time.

There may even be a small intro/preview soon, time permitting.


[] DELAYED EIL DEMO IN THE BAGGIO! []

Wildfire's  delayed Error in Line ST demo should make its long  awaited 
appearance  at the SV2000 party.  Due to time related pressures,  not a 
lot  of  activity  has been forthcoming before now,  but we  have  been 
informed  that  the  demo is now 80% finished,  and should  be  finally 
completed in good time to be released at the Sili'.


[] T.O.Y.S MAY BE FEELING PROJECT BLUE? []

A new STe demo called 'Project Blue', first reported in Toxic Mag issue 
18 does seem to be alive, sort of.

Such  wonders  as  a 12-bit video mode,  a 'Descent style'  3D  engine, 
Motion Blur,  Bump-mapping, and more, were reported. We have heard from 
PeyloW that there is something going on, but there are no release dates 
yet.  That deadly enemy of the Atari scene,  lack of time,  is delaying 
things.  Those  effects  which  have been completed,  are described  as 
'incredibly high quality',  but they are too unpolished, and not enough 
for a proper demo yet.

Of their other projects,  no new news at the moment.  Hopes are high we 
will see the team at SV2000 this Easter.


[] LAST CAB HOME? []

Alexander  Clauss  amazed  everyone by releasing CAB 2.8 at the   Atari 
Messe  in November.  This is thought to feature .PNG graphics  support, 
and several bugfixes. This seemed to contradict earlier statements from 
him  that he no longer had sufficient time to continue  development  of 
CAB?  However,  we  would  view  this as a large bugfix and tidying  up 
exercise,  it  is  unlikely  that  any  major  new  features,  such  as 
Javascript, will be added in the future.

He  is  currently working on the similar sounding,  but very much  more 
commercially profitable Mac-based iCAB browser.


[] MAGIC CIRCLE! []

Rumours of the forthcoming MagiC 7 are starting to circulate.  The most 
interesting of these speculates that it is to include its own  built-in 
networking,  and  maybe  even internet connection software,  thus doing 
away with the STiK/STinG connection layer?!


[] MILAN MELEE! []

Suddenly,  things  seem to be looking up for the makers of Milan,  with 
their  announcement  of  the Milan II '060  model.  This  includes  USB 
connectivity,  with an impressive 060 based specification,  and a large 
amount of interest from the remaining commercial Atari developers.

Yes,  there are going to be games especially for Milan,  with top-rated 
Arkanoid  clone for the Falcon 'Impulse' and Duke Nuke clone  'Running' 
both  being  converted and enhanced for this machine.  there are  other 
third party games in the pipeline too.
                                                                     
Rumours have spawned and proliferated. These are the best of them..

Apple Mac peripherals to be added via the USB. A 'large German company' 
is  working  on  drivers  for all  kinds  of  peripherals,  replacement 
keyboards, to CD writers and TV tuners etc?

A Macintosh emulator for Milan is successfully running MacOS.8 in beta. 
It should be available by the time Milan II goes on sale?

German  newsgroups  suggest that Milan may be sold  outside  of  German 
markets  solely  as  a  Linux box?  This would be an  attempt  to  gain 
commercial  acceptance in markets not recently used to Atari TOS  based 
systems.  In Germany,  it will sell with a MagiC/Jinnee desktop O/S and 
front-end. The role of TOS is to be downgraded to the BIOS level.

If  Milan  sells 10,000 units,  there will be a transition  to  PowerPC 
based CPU's for a future generation?
 Further information would suggest that a PPC Milan is very likely,  and 
even a portable Milan is under consideration!
 
- This one is true! -
Hewlett  Packard *are* hard at work writing new drivers for their  most 
modern printers and scanners to work with Milan! These will all connect 
via the USB.

One  observer  at  the  Messe described it  as  'three-one  to  Milan', 
compared with Centek. 


[] ASH LOOK FOR NEW WEB BROWSER? []

There  is  some  loose talk of a high-end  CAB  replacement?  ASH  (App 
Systems  Heidelberg) rumoured to be working on a CAB replacement.  Both 
the Behne Brothers of NVDI fame, and the team behind MagiC are supposed 
to be heavily involved? 

This will be a genuine modern browser capable of supporting the  latest 
HTML  features  and  protocols,  and I'm sure you can guess  this  will 
include things beginning with 'Java' and ending in 'Script'!

Other  accounts suggest that this may be nothing more than  loose  talk 
after all, though :(


[] RUNNING MEETS THE ITALIAN JOB! []

RDT  are  hard at work on the single biggest incentive  to  purchase  a 
Milan  in the new year.  The Milan version of 'Running' is in the works 
for  Spring  2000.   It will have an  entirely  new level with two  new 
missions,   double resolution for textures and bad guys from the Falcon 
original,  and  support for high detail levels.  This may  well  be the 
production that breaks down the staid and slightly dull  'productivity' 
image of the Milan at last!


[] MYSTIC BYTES TOP THE POLE! []
 
CiH  note,  I  hand the keys over to Grey for a minute,  thanks for the 
cool news about the new MB demo,  I'm definitely booking my tickets for 
SV2000 now!
 
We,  Mystic  Bytes are busy working on the SV2000 invitros  (separately 
for  Falcon and ST).  Invitros were announced over 2 months ago but  we 
couldn't  release it...  The reason is so simple - not all details were 
fixed yet. The date of the party has been changed - party will start at 
21st  and will end at 24th day of April (Friday-Monday,  as the most of 
the  ppl wished for!).  Invitros will be released at January.  Till the 
3rd day of January I will set details for 100%.

Mystic Bytes is also working on the new multi-part demo for the  Falcon 
-  "Upside  Down".  The demo will be pretty FAT and will need at  least 
14MB  of RAM.  What kind of effects you can expect?  That's a secret... 
Just  a  one  thing...  "MSB is going to kick some butts!".  Demo  will 
feature  NEW  effects...  tunnels free-zone :))) "Upside down" WILL  BE 
released at Silly Venture 2000!

>>p.s. new MSB demo for the Falcon will kick some ass! :)))) 
CIH> I like the sound of this, any more information at this stage, 
CIH> even a teeny-tiny hint to whet peoples appetites!?

Hmmm...  well...  :))  The  demo will feature neat graphics and  "high- 
standard" effects... It should be the real kicker since few years!! :)) 
The previews which are already done beats everything what MSB did up to 
now... you will love this demo! Can't tell anything more... sorry!

Sea Brush (another ex member of Confusions) joined Mystic Bytes as  the 
musician.


[] COBRA STRIKES! []

Winio  is going to release another Falcon demo at Silly  Venture  2000! 
During  the  phone-chat  Winio mentioned that  "bunch  of  REALLY  good 
graphicians and musicians wished to contribute to new Cobra demo",  but 
didn't tell who they are.. It gonna be another surprise... :))

Also the ST coder behind Cobra,  Mayonez,  is also going to release his 
ST demo at SV2000!

 Thanks again Grey! 


[] SV2000 CONFIRMED! []

Whilst  we are on the subject of the Polish scene,  confirmation of the 
dates  for Sillyventure 2000 has been received.  These are going to  be 
the  21st  to the 24th April Easter weekend.  A lot  more  information, 
including  quite  a  bit in a tour guide vein  about  the  venue  city, 
Gdansk,  is in the invitation text file, rather handily located in this 
issue of Maggie!

There is a great deal of interest already. It looks like there is to be 
a  large  Polish  8-Bit Atari presence,  in addition to  the  ST/Falcon 
contingent.  Of  particular  interest on the guest list,  are ST coding 
wizards Syntax, and even the reappearance of Pandemonium. The follow-up 
to  their satanically styled Falcon Siliconvention release 'Ignis',  is 
awaited with great interest! This really sounds like the scene party to 
be at,  this Easter, as Grey describes the ST and Falcon based parts of 
the  Polish  scene  as "Motivated like never  before..."  (Even  people 
considered currently 'dead'!)  


[] PLEASED TO MEET YOU MP3! []

Mequignon Didier, the star behind Aniplayer has made his latest release 
(v2.08)  able to play the famous and widespread MP3 audio file  format! 
This  is pushing it a tad too hard at the moment on a standard  Falcon, 
but it is able to cope with CT2-accelerated Falcons and higher end  TOS 
machines  with  ease.  the  sound is fully  stereo  supporting.  Future 
releases  of Aniplayer are intended to include full MPEG movie  support 
with  soundtrack,  and  hopefully,  further  optimisations for the  MP3 
format to make this more viable on a standard unexpanded Falcon.


[] SECTOR ONE TURNS UP THE FALCAMP! []

The  other MP3 player on the Atari is now coming to fruition.  FalcAMP, 
the  Sector  One project,  does work well on a standard  Falcon!  David 
Carrere of 'Flaysid' fame is working on the DSP part.  The beta version 
0.8  was released,  just a day or so before Aniplayer 2.08!  FalcAMP is 
currently  a simple TTP program,  and only able to playback in mono  at 
present,  but is fine with standard unexpanded Falcons.  Future FalcAMP 
releases  will be optimised further,  gain a proper GEM interface,  and 
should  be  able to play all MP audio files in full stereo.  

Version  0.9 and 0.92 has since been released,  and apart from  welcome 
bugfixes, also features an interrupt driven DSP decoder, to make it run 
properly under a multi-tasking environment.

David  Carrere is also apparently working on an Atari  8-bit  soundchip 
POKEY player, and further versions of FlaySID may still appear?


[] IT'S ANOTHER KIND OF MAGIC! []

The  MagiC  games compo closed on the 25th December  1999.  There  were 
eight  full entries,  and another game 'Rosemary Rancoon' that got  out 
too soon and was disqualified from the competition. Various genres from 
classic arcade to board games are all represented.  These are generally 
runnable  on  most fair to middling GEM based systems in spite  of  the 
'MagiC  Games' label.  Check out the reviews and competition results in 
this issue!

I  might  sneak in and say well done to Mario Becroft for  his  winning 
entry, the Sokoban playalike GEM-friendly, 'Orb'!


[] FUN, AND GAMES? []

Fun are quiet at the moment, a new website, www.fun-industries.nl is in 
its very early stages.  A new demo is planned, but this is very much at 
the beginning,  with no deadline to complete it.  Also,  there are some 
reports that Havoc is to return soon to the scene?

Keen  observers  wanting to keep up with the movements of  Earx,  might 
want  to check out the homepage of Escape as new and updated Whip!  VLM 
modules from him turn up there from time to time.


[] ENEMY WAR WINTER OFFENSIVE! []

Marcus  Binder  is  back!  A  new Falcon game,  Enemy War II  has  been 
announced.  This features a number of Falcon specific enhancements over 
the  previous Enemy War ST version,  not least of which is a  800 x 600 
game  resolution,  all  the  better  to display  the  enhanced  in-game 
graphics.  This  will  be  optimised especially for AB040  Falcons  and 
fastRAM machines.

(A little later..) There is also an ST/STe version to come, this to run 
in a virtual 640 x 400 screen mode, and needing a screen expander for a 
stock ST/STe.


[] WHERE RG?! []

The  Reservoir  Gods are in a state best described as 'bubbling  under' 
at  the  moment.   Mr  Pink is 'very busy' in his new job at  Bullfrog.  
I'm  sure  he'd love to tell you loads of exciting new stuff about  the  
PSX2  internals,   but   I'm  equally  sure he'd have to kill and   eat  
himself afterwards, under the terms of his Non-Disclosure agreement! 

Of the rest,  MSG, Ripley, and Sh3. there is no real news at all. There 
as  a Cymvention in late October where most of the Gods  got  together, 
but  nothing  emerged  from that.  Ripley broke cover on  the  DHS  BBS 
recently,  to  say  that she only had contact with her Falcon,  to  use 
Protext!  She is in the final year of her degree course. Sh3 is also at 
university,  and  hassled by hardware death and strange Atari-badged PC 
monitors. MSG, well have you lot got any ideas where he is?

As Mr Pink is still keen on coding Atari stuff, but is prevented by the 
extreme  nature  of the hours he works,  we propose a new  campaign  in 
defence of liberty!

…FREE THE GUILDFORD ONE!  


[] ROB GOLDSMITH TO WALK ON THE HIGHWIRE? []

Rob  Goldsmith,  The  man  behind Zetnet Atari  support  has  something 
interesting  on the way.  The Highwire web browser was seen working  at 
the Stafford AMS show in November.  It is  still at an early stage, but 
various  other  parties  are  co-collaborating to  try  to  bring  this 
further.  Most  interestingly,  it  will  be  a freeware  release,  and 
eventually intended to bring up-to-date features even to less  powerful 
hardware.  Rob's view is that other platforms, such as the PC and Amiga 
have good freeware browsers,  so why not Atari? It presently can format 
and display a HTML page in half the time CAB does!

Further development is on a 'time permitting' basis, so don't expect to 
see too much very soon.


[] PARANOIA, THEY ARE OUT TO GET YOU! []

Paranoia have been showing recent life-signs.  Their 'Sim-Atariscne', a 
one-off  joke,  was not popular in certain quarters!  Their forthcoming 
game, Extreme Pong has been delayed due to partial loss of source code. 
This was originally intended to be released at the Paracon.

There has been a very late Xmas demo promised from them as well.


[] TNH KICKS THROUGH THE NIGHT! []
                
Sim-Bacteria  game  'Kweek' from Crackman producers,  Teenage,  is  due 
'real soon now', maybe slightly overdue, as it was pencilled in for the 
Xmas  period?  Also  a comedy diskzine,  the 'Undertaker' Maggie  scene 
is on its way, with about a 3% completion rate for articles!?


[] UNDERCOVER, UNDER PRESSURE? []

UCM   16 was released,   one rumour at the time suggested future issues 
going  HTML   to some  extent?   This was a reasonable  issue  produced 
under  the new editorship of  ST  Survivor,   but feeling the pinch  in 
outside help and contributions like everyone else.

UCM  17  followed.  This was  very thin content-wise,  a Xmas or end of 
year 'millenium' special issue is due out anytime now.

This  became  UCM  18,  another  issue produced under  the  'small  but 
frequent' formula,  and in addition to the usual content, also featured 
a  large  dollop of useful coding tutorials and related  material  from 
Earx and Candyman.

Doubtless,  more  UCM  issues  to follow,  with a SV2000 special  issue 
pencilled in there somewhere?


[] MAGGIE RAZES ROSEWELL! []

The   Maggie special one off issue,   the Psycho Babble Project,  which 
was held over from  Error in Line last Easter,  was finally released in  
November.   The  Psycho  Babble Project is a skeptical look at the  UFO 
lover  fraternity,  and  other counter-culture issues from a  humourous 
viewpoint.  It uses the ST shell.  At least one other one-off 'special' 
is planned,  with a definite theme or concept for it, but no time scale 
yet,  or even what form it will take? 

There  is also the small matter of fitting in the 10th  Birthday  issue 
this summer...


[] CAUGHT IN A TOXIC WEB! []

Toxic Mag released  issue  18,  firstly  in  HTML webzine dual-language 
format,   with   English translated articles,  with a traditional Atari 
shell, with intro by Dune still awaited.

The new editorial team seem to be making a reasonable job of it.

Uodate  -  The Atari shell version,  with a cool Falcon  compatible  ST 
intro by Dune has finally been released.


[] MR DATA, MAKE IT SO! []

Data of Trio (Patrice Mandin) is steadily improving his Doom, Hexen and 
Heretic  ports.  Current versions have got to v0.23,  now including VDI 
display,  so  they  can be run on generic higher end Atari clones,  and 
some  sound support.  (Effects but not music).  Check out the review of 
v0.21 of Doom this issue.

Also new emulator ports are being considered.  these are SNES, Neo Geo, 
and even MAME!  Whether these can be runnable on a standard Falcon,  or 
will need substantially more powerful Atari clones, remains unclear. My 
own  guess  is,  that something like a CT2 Falcon will be  the  MINIMUM 
spec!  At the moment,  these are just statements of intent,  but surely 
something will appear before too long?

For  those people really interested,  Patrice has already compiled a  C 
source  emulator  for  the  VCS console,  but reckons  in  its  current 
unoptimised state,  it is too slow to run decently on a standard Falcon 
'030.

Still on the subject, Patrice has added a 'Descent' port to his list of 
'things to do', now the source for this out in the open.


[] MATT SMITH IS SHACKING UP! []

Matt  Smith,  he  who  supplied the handy 'Running' players  guide  for 
Maggie,  is busy on a proposed games CD for next year.  There is also a 
beta  test  of a ST (but compatible with Falcon) platform  game  called 
'Down the Pipes' game available from his website,  the Atari Shack. The 
preview is playable, the subject matter on the lines of something 'Nun' 
would do! 

He  is  currently working on a new and improved games engine  for  this 
game,  and  is  open to any suggestions!


[] STUNE-D PRUNES! []

Stune,  the 'Dune 2' strategy game in GEM is at version 0.60.  released 
at  the Paracon.  It was first seen at EIL.  A mixed team consisting of 
Thothy  and  Sokrates is behind this,  with Spion of Escape  doing  the

[] IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL THE SONGBIRD SINGS! []

Songbird   Productions  announce  that  three  new  Jaguar  games   are 
forthcoming  very  soon.  These are 'Protector' and  'Hyperforce',  two 
original  arcade  2D  games,  and also Rebellion's unreleased  3D  game 
'Skyhammer'.  'Protector', a nifty Defender style game, may well be out 
by now, the others are due early next year.

Update:  They now have acquired three unreleased Lynx games from Beyond 
Games. These are Cyber Virus, Ultra Vortex, and Mechtiles.

(From the Press Release..)
 
Cybervirus is  an incredible  first-person  perspective,  mission-based
action game based on the Lynx BattleWheels engine set in an apocolyptic
future  where  rogue  computers  and  virus-infected  robotic  warriors 
threaten the very survival of humanity. Ultra Vortex, the original Lynx
version of what became Ultra Vortek on the Atari Jaguar,  is an awesome
two-player  fighting game.  Mechtiles is  a multiplayer  game  of giant
robot combat, also based on the award-winning BattleWheels engine.

 We  are  advised  that Cybervirus is going to be  the  first  of  these 
released,  'later  in  2000'.  The other games being evaluated for  how 
much more work needs doing, before these get a firm release date.


[] PLEASE FELICE ME, LET ME GO! []

Felice mentioned at the Stafford Show,  that he fancied doing something 
for SV2000,  this may be in the form of a Fake demo or wild competition 
entry? Could be interesting!?


[] STORMIN' NORMAN! []

Escape are in the frame for current and future activity,  further Whip! 
VLM  add-ons have turned up,  some from third parties such as known VLM 
enthusiast  Earx,  and  previously  unknown  fan  Sokrates.  There  are 
anything up to four new ones, plus any updates that have crept in since 
the release of their bugfixed Whip v0.31.

No of Escape tells us that a new version of Whip! is in the works, with 
a number of new features,  and  a lot of updated modules will come  out 
together with the new version.

Even  better,  when/if  the  new  Phenix  260T turns  up,  he  will  be 
developing  a virtual light machine for that computer,  so if Whip!  is 
this cool now on a standard Falcy, what is he going to come up with for 
the vastly superior Phenix!?

There are some other projects planned, but no firm news here as yet.


[] FADING TWILIGHT DELIGHT! []

MC  Laser  is  currently  compiling what he  intends  to  be  the  most 
comprehensive music compilation CD-ROM for the Atari scene.

'Fading  Twilight' is intended to gather together as much  Atari  scene 
music  in one place,  this will include material from all the different 
ages  of  the scene.  The preferred format is Protracker  modfile,  but 
things like soundchip, SIDchip, multi-channel formats, and even MP3 are 
being considered.

Hopefully,  a wealth of material,  including many previously unreleased 
tunes will make its way onto there. We wish MC Laser every success.

Update:  A  small  collection of old but interesting stuff is  released 
under  the tSCc label with the title 'Revisited'.  In the acccompanying 
textfile, a small statement from MC Laser saying "Ignore what I said in 
'Songs of Distant Earth', we're still here!


[] NATURE GOES THE FULL MEG MONTY! []

Nature  haven't  been  lying around and doing  nothing  over  the  Xmas 
holidays.  Firstly,  work continues on 'Reekin' Rubber', which is being 
optimised further. The big news is, that it will definitely be a 14 meg 
only release! They ran out of 'unnecessary' things to cut out to make a 
4  meg  version  possible.  A system accelerator may well  improve  the 
playability a bit as well. Hopefully a new version release soon, but no 
dates given in that direction as yet.

Also, there is a new game project 'Natris' coming through. Described as 
a  'truecolour  Tetris  clone  for up to  two  players'.  The  code  is 
essentially complete, but the graphics and sound are lagging behind. It 
will be interesting to see how it compares with other efforts,  such as 
the discontinued 'Xktris'?


[] YESCREW ARE EMUXL-ENT! []

Draco  has  been busy behind the scenes,  as the latest version of  his 
Atari 800XL emulator for the Falcon has been quietly slipped out.  This 
is  version 0.41 of his ongoing 'Emu-XL'.  This features many  bugfixes 
and  substantial  improvements  over previous versions.  Not  least  of 
these,  is  the  recognition  of 'drag and drop' protocol,  so you  can 
autoboot  disk  images  right away,  without having  to  negotiate  the 
forbidding MYDOS front-end.  People with TT's and higher end clones may 
well be interested to learn that Emu-XL will run quite happily on their 
machines  now,  as  it  has been coded a lot more  system-legally  than 
before.  There is still quite a lot to do, but even now, certain games, 
not too closely tied to the 800XL hardware, will run on this emulation. 
'Mercenary' and 'Amaurote' being two such listed.

The  speed  remains reasonable,  currently 37-38% of the original on  a 
standard Falcon,  and about 90% on a TT with FastRAM. It does recognise 
accelerators  from the likes of Nemesis to CT2 and Afterburner.  Emu-XL 
is coded in 100% assembler.

This  has been developed on a MinT environment,  but also runs  happily 
under single-TOS and even MagiC!

Meanwhile, Toodeloo quietly works away, producing more new MP3 tunes.


[] FALCON SYNTH EMU AT LAST?! []

Some  interesting,  not to mention confusing developments over the last 
few days on the vexed subject of 'Falcon Synthesiser emulation'!

People  with  long memories may well recall a number of  such  products 
promised,  but never delivered. There was the System Solutions 'General 
synthesiser',  which  went  all  quiet,  even  Tat  had a  go  in  that 
direction,  which  was  ultimately  unproductive.  We all remember  the 
Sentry TB303 emulator,  which was very close to release about a year or 
so ago, but seems to have been laid low by the curse of non-completion?

Well, first the bad news.

Havoc  has gone public to say that Sentry are no longer working on  any 
Atari related projects, it must be the case that their TB303 emu' is no 
more?

The interesting news is,  that New Beat are working on a 'softsynth' of 
some  kind.  Havoc has seen a preview and "it rocks." Whether this sees 
daylight or not, is, of course, debatable?

The even more interesting news,  is that a totally new,  and previously 
unknown  contributor  to the debate has thrown his hat into  the  ring. 
Here  is the posting from the Atari.org forums that I took the  liberty 
of including.

There  was a note on the DHS "scene news" about a year  ago  explaining 
that  Sector  One (or somebody) was working on a falcon  303  emulator.  
However,   such  an  emulator  never  appeared.   (This  refers  to  the 
ultimately abortive Sentry project, nothing to do with Sector One..)
 
The good news is this:  the DSP is MORE THAN CAPABLE of performing this 
emulation.   AFAIK  the  303 sound consists of 1 oscilator,  a low-pass 
filter,  some  crude  envelopes,  and the famous 16-step sequencer that 
makes  squelchy dance tunes soooo easy.   I am working on a  soft-synth 
for the falcon DSP currently.   It is already capable of filtering etc. 
(which  of course,  any program calling itself a soft-synth would be!).  
I plan on releasing it soon (within one month).

My  question  to  you is ...  why do you want that overused  303  sound 
anyways? There is a whole world of synthesis that can be achieved using 
the wonderful DSP 56000.   Is it the groove sequencer you're interested 
in, or the squelchy sound?

If  Jason  can keep his promise in an area where so  many  others  have 
failed, then this could be one of the biggest releases of the year!


[] POV WERE NOT BORN JESTERDAY! []

Persistence  of  Vision maintain their grip on the  Falcon  music  demo 
marketplace,  with  a  release of their tribute to famous  Amiga  scene 
musician,  Jester of Sanity. 'Jesterday' is based on the Amiga original 
sound demo done in 1992.  This 'remix' for the Falcy has been done with 
the consent of Jester, which was nice!


[] NOCREW ARE ON THE EGO TV! []

A  long  germinating idea in the minds of NoCrew is about to  poke  its 
first tentative shoots of growth into the rich surrounding soil, and... 
(Get on with it! - Impatient Maggie News Ed)

The Ego TV label,  when it is up and running properly,  will consist of 
camcorder-filmed  extracts,  from  their website,  of various humourous 
situations,  in  the format of a television show.  Much of this will be 
for  the  groups own appreciation,  so expect lots of obscure  in-jokes 
which no outsider will ever hope to understand!

The  Falcon-based  'Ego  Demo',  shown at Error in Line,  and  reviewed 
elsewhere, was related to this.

A  wise  man once said,  "Beware of those productions where the  people 
making it, clearly had more fun than the audience watching it!"

(He  also  said "If you have a tendency to  stress  incontinence,  then 
don't wear skimpy panties!")


[] TORMENT GO BACK TO OLDSKOOL! []

Torment are working on a new ST demo, this has no release date yet, but 
hopefully will be seen in the earlier part of this year. It is going to 
consist  of totally new code,  with a leaning to classic or 'oldschool' 
design but "done well",  according to Spiny, although it may be done in 
a PC demo style, so the odd 'new' effect may be in there too.


[] ATARI WORLD LOOKING GOOD ON PAPER! []

When  Atari Computing,  the UK's premier(*) paper magazine closed down, 
how we all gnashed our teeth in disappointment.  At an end, was our own 
rich and fruitful involvement in the 'Maggie Pages',  a lukewarm column 
running from a 'scene' perspective.

 (*) ST Plus people, no teddies thrown out of the prams please! 

Well,  the great news is, that there is to shortly be a new paper-based 
Atari  mag  'Atari World',  picking up where Atari Computing left  off! 
Full announcements, etc, will be trailblazed shortly all over the usual 
places, we're just getting in there first!

A  mysterious figure known only as "Bob" is thought to be behind  this, 
and he can be contacted on Bobf@techsoftware.freeserve.co.uk


[] EPIC MARKETING ARE 'GAME' FOR IT! []

And  finally,  something  of  a 'first' for a long while in  the  Atari 
world, a new commercial games publisher arrives!

These brave souls are Epic Marketing, better known as publishers on the 
Amiga  and  PC.  They are taking note of the new interest in the  Atari 
Platform,  mainly  with regard to the impending arrival of the Milan 2, 
but other Atari systems may well be developed for, if possible.

Conversions  of  some  of their Amiga titles  are  planned.  These  are 
currently 'Foundation Edge',  'Simon the Sorcerer II,  a game described 
as  comparable with Monkey Island,  and 'Tales from Heaven',  a 3D jump 
and  run in Mario 64 style.  Work will commence when developer machines 
arrive  shortly,  and  their website will have an Atari section up  and 
running by the end of January.

The URL for their homepage is;        

 www.epicmarketing.ltd.net/
