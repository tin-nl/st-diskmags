The most enduring and unchanging part of Maggie changed at last?

Well,  not  that  much,  for  brown  padded envelope through  the  door 
purposes, I'm still at Rushden.

CiH/Maggie GHQ
 26 Robinson Road

    UK, of course, if that needed overstating, which it doesn't.

Same old address really.

Email, you can get me on cih@atari.org

If the atari.org redirection is having a funny haha fit,  which doesn't 
happen often, but has happened once fairly recently, then try this:-

maggieteam@zetnet.co.uk

This is the Zetnet (service provider) supplied address, if their server 
is in a 'tits-up' state, then there's no hope at all!

Web Pages, best to check out rg.atari.org for any new issues of Maggie. 
The Dead Hackers pages should also contain any recent issues too.  They 
have  loads  of  current  Atari  scene  news  too.   For  all  of  this 
wonderfulness, click on dhs.atari.org

Contributions, Nnneeed contributions, slaver, drool!

'Nuff said, bye!
