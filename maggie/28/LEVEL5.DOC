Primary mission    :  Find the big water tank.

Secondary mission  :  Enter the inner reactor zone.

You start this level at the end of a corridor by a terminal on a  wall. 
There  is a large door on the left which leads out into the open and  a 
corridor on the right.  Go up the corridor on the right, kill the hippy 
and the soldier.

In  the first room on the right is some ammo,  get this and carry on to 
the next room.  In here you'll find a technician,  kill him and pick up 
the medikit, ignore the flame thrower, you've got one.

In  the next room on the right is a technician and a hippy,  kill  them 
both  and  get the ammo and medikit.  There is a hidden entrance  to  a 
corridor in here.  To find it just walk into the wall opposite the door 
you  came in by.  It's on the left just before you get to the corner of 
the room, in the corridor you'll find the nightviewer.

Go  back  through the hidden entrance and exit the room  and  go  right 
along  the corridor,  kill another hippy,  pick up the ammo and shield. 
There  is no need to go in the door at the end as we have  already  got 
the nightviewer that was hidden behind the narrow passageway.

Make  your way back down the corridor to the large door that leads  out 
into  the  open.  Go through and turn right then right again,  kill the 
hippy and soldiers and pick up the ammo, ultra scanner and map.
 
BIG HINT FOR LATER

There now follows a rather nice shortcut that you can use later, if you 
want.  Turn  around so you are facing a large wall that has 5  vertical 
girders.  Head  towards  this wall,  there is a secret room behind  the 
second  girder  from the left.  In this room you'll find some  shields, 
these  will  probably come in handy now,  but wait...  Turn around  and 
you'll see what looks like a wall mounted speaker on the left hand wall 
on the doorway.

Walk  towards the speaker so you are facing it,  turn left to face  the 
wall  on  the left and walk through into another secret room.  In  this 
room  there  is a pad in the corner,  I must admit it doesn't look  too 
interesting,  but if you back out of the room and re-enter the pad will 
turn into a transporter pad.  You can use this pad as a shortcut to get 
to the exit,  but it will be of no use unless you've completed both the 
primary  and secondary mission.  You can try it for a laugh but  you'll 
find yourself stuck and not able to go anywhere.

Anway,  go back out into the the open,  past the hippy and soldiers you 
killed  earlier.  Go  right  at  the top and kill  the  technician  and 
soldier,  pick up the medikit.  Continue forward and go right, kill the 
technician  on  a  small  ledge and a soldier  hiding  behind  a  small 
watertank.  Pick  up  the ammo,  shield and the medikits on top of  the 
small  watertank,  take note of the trolley going up and down a  raised 
platform.

You should see a small corridor with some ammo near the entrance to it, 
go up here. Pick up the ammo and a medikit, kill a technician, continue 
along  and pick up another medikit,  at the end of the corridor  you'll 
find  another map and a monitor screen.  Looking at the monitor  screen 
will  show you the inner reactor core,  entering here will complete the 
secondary mission.

Go  back  down the corridor,  on the left is a door,  if you go in here 
you'll find a handful of technicians guarding another ultra scanner and 
 a  shield  at one end of a corridor.  At the other end of the  corridor 
you'll  find  a  room  with a shield in guarded  by  a  soldier  and  a 
technician. Go in and do a bit of killing if you want to.

If you didn't then continue back down the corridor turning right at the 
end,  and  then  right again.  You'll see a small gap in a wall on  the 
left,  go  in  and follow the corridor round,  pick up the ammo,  kill a 
technician and a hippy,  pick up some more ammo a medikit, forget about 
the nightviewer as you already have one.

Go back out into the open,  and head towards the 2 medikits,  turn left 
and  kill  the tramp hiding behind the wall,  pick up the shield.  Turn 
around  and kill a couple of soldiers,  pick up the ammo and  medikits. 
Kill  a  couple of hippies,  one hiding in the alcove the other  hiding 
behind it, pick up the ammo.

There is a secret room in the wall on the left behind the alcove,  just 
where the ammo is, go in and pick up the monster detector.

Now  go  in the door by the front of the alcove where  you  killed  the 
soldiers. Turn right and kill 2 technicians, pick up the ammo, continue 
along and go in the door on the right. Kill the soldier waiting inside. 
Hey  there's another monster detector in here,  but you've already  got 
one.

Drop  off the ledge at the end of this room,  kill the soldier and pick 
up the ammo and red key.  Use the lift platform at the end to go up, do 
a running jump to a small pillar, jump up again and then across back to 
the room.

There  is a hidden entrance to a corridor with a switch that opens  the 
door at the far end of the main corridor. It's in the wall opposite the 
door,  you can do it if you want,  but the room at the other end of the 
corridor has nothing special in it,  just a shield, and it's guarded by 
a  couple of soldiers.  Exit the room and pick up a shield that is just 
around the corner on the right, pick it up then go out of the door back 
out into the open.
 
Turn left when you're out in the open and you'll see a door over on the 
right,  go in...  nothing special in here...  wrong. Walk up to the end 
wall and wait a bit,  back up to the center of the room and wait a bit. 
Now go forward again, the wall should change to a grating, this you can 
walk  through.  Kill the mutant waiting on the other side,  pick up the 
ammo, follow the corridor along.

Instead of turning right and going out of the doorway continue  walking 
straight ahead,  you'll walk through a wall, follow this corridor along 
and drop down off the ledge, pick up the ammo, there is a terminal here 
so save the game.

Have  a  look through the grating opposite the terminal,  it looks  out 
onto  a large open space,  kill the 2 mutants wandering around outside. 
Go back up the corridor and use the lift platform to go up,  follow the 
corridor  around  and  go out of the doorway into the  open.  Out  here 
you'll find loads of ammo, shields and medikits so fill your boots.

Having  done  that go up the stairs,  back along the corridor,  out the 
door  and  into  the open.  Go right and head back  towards  where  the 
trolley is. Stand on the small ledge where the dead technician is, wait 
until  the trolley has moved out to the far end of the raised  platform 
and do a running jump onto the raised platform,   run along it into the 
corridor  and  turn right at the grating.  There is a terminal  on  the 
wall, save the game here.

The monitor screen opposite the terminal shows you the primary mission, 
be  careful  not to get run over by the trolley when you go to  have  a 
look at it. Use the transporter pad to get to another area.

You'll  find yourself in a room,  perched on a high pillar,  there is a 
raised  platform to the left,  there is a trolley that runs along  here 
into  a  corridor.  Drop  off of the pillar and head towards  the  wall 
infront of you,  it's a false wall that you can walk through,  kill the 
technician and hippy, pick up the ammo, medikit and shield.

 Go  through  the large door and turn right,  go through the grey  door, 
kill the soldier and hippy in the corridor and pick up the ammo.  Flick 
the switch on the left at the end of the corridor.

There  is a hidden doorway just to the left of the switch,  go  through 
it.  You are now in a secret area,  pick up the medikit on the right as 
you go in, follow the corridor along to the end.

JUMP!!  Yes that's right, do a running jump to the doorway on the other 
side, pick up the train detector when you land. There is a rather large 
secret  area  in  here but I'll let you find out  about  that  all  for 
yourself.  You  can if you want ignore the secret area as you will pick 
up  the things you need a bit later on.  One small hint is that  you'll 
need to use the nightviewer to find the exit in this area.

If you want to explore the secret area go ahead,  otherwise turn around 
and do a running jump back to where you came from.  Follow the corridor 
along  and around,  go through the grey door and through the brown  one 
opposite. 

Follow the corridor around,  pick up the shield as you go. Use the lift 
platform  to  go up,  turn right and you'll se a doorway,  wait by  the 
doorway  until the trolley has gone past heading right.  Turn right and 
follow the trolley up the corridor, but don't get too close.

Keep  following the trolley until you see a small alcove on  the  left, 
duck  into  this  alcove and pick up the shield.  Wait here  until  the 
trolley  comes  back  down the corridor past you,  continue  along  the 
corridor.  After  a  bit  the corridor widens and  you'll  see  another 
corridor on the right.

Turn  in  here  and kill a couple of soldiers,  pick up  the  ammo  and 
another  ultra scanner.  Continue along into a small train depot.  Kill 
the soldier and hippy hiding behind the pillars, turn around and kill a 
technician down a small corridor.  Go down the corridor and pick up the 
ammo and shield,  there is a small gap on the left, kill the hippy that 
you see on the other side.
 
Go back into the train depot,  pick up the ammo and shield, go down the 
other  small corridor that leads off from it.  There is a false wall at 
the  end  so walk through into a corridor where you killed  the  hippy, 
pick up the shields.

Turn  left and go along the corridor,  pick up the medikits as you  go. 
The corridor goes round to the left, follow it round and kill a soldier 
and  a couple of technician,  pick up the ammo.  There is a door on the 
left,  go through and kill the soldier waiting in the room. Pick up the 
medikit  and flick the switch which opens a door at the far end of  the 
corridor. 

Exit the room and go left along the corridor, pick up the shield as you 
go.  When you see another switch on the left you've made it through the 
door.  Kill the soldier and technician around the corner, and enter the 
room.  You'll  find yourself on a high ledge,  on the other side of the 
room you'll see a large lift platform with a grating in front of it.

From  up  on the ledge kill the hippy and soldier waiting  below,  drop 
down  and pick up the ammo.  There is a door in the corner opposite the 
lift  platform,  go through.  Kill the technician and pick up the ammo, 
drop down into a lower corridor, kill the hippy and pick up the ammo.

Continue  along the blue corridor until you see a grating on the  left, 
from  here you can kill a couple of soldiers a technician and  a  hippy 
that are walking around outside.

In the corridor you'll also find a very small ledge, get on it and face 
toward  the ledge where there is a trolley moving along it.  Wait until 
the trolley has moved across going to the right than do a running  jump 
up  into the corridor.  Turn left and continue along the corridor until 
you see a small corridor on the right, turn right into it.

There are a couple of room at the end of this corridor,  the one on the 
left has a soldier and hippy waiting inside, kill them both and pick up 
the  ammo,  medikit and shield.  The room on the right has just a tramp 
 inside, kill him and get the ammo and medikits.

Wait  in  the  small corridor until the trolley running  in  the  other 
corridor has gone to the left. Go right into the corridor and follow it 
to  the end,  pick up the medikit and drop down through the opening  on 
the  left.  Kill the soldier waiting at the bottom,  go through another 
doorway out into the open.

Pick  up the ammo and gasmask that you find.  You'll see a door on  the 
end of a wall,  go through it. Kill the soldier on the other side. Pick 
up the medikit,  jump onto the small pillar at the back of the room, do 
a  small running jump onto another pillar that has a medikit on top  of 
it.  Do another running jump onto another pillar. Press the spacebar to 
go up.

Go  along  the corridor and pick up the ammo,  drop down the ledge  and 
turn  right,  turn on the nightviewer on as you'll need it in a minute. 
wait until the trolley has passed to the right then turn left into  the 
corridor,  continue along until you see a <-HERE sign on the right hand 
wall.

This shows you where there is a hidden door, press the spacebar to open 
it. Kill the soldier and go in, pick up the ammo and turn right. You'll 
see a grating at the end of the corridor, there is a switch on the wall 
to  the  left,  flick the switch,  it activates the large lift platform 
that  has  the  grating in front of it.  Don't forget to turn  off  the 
nightviewer.

Make  your  way to the other end of the corridor,  put the gas mask  on 
now.  Use  the  lift platform to go up,  continue along and pick up the 
radiation  suit.  Turn  right,  pick up the medikit,  you are now by the 
large  water  tank,  walk along the raised platform towards it.  You've 
just completed the primary mission.

Back up and go down the corridor,  through the hidden door,  wait until 
the trolley has passed to the left,  go down the corridor and drop down 
into the blue corridor on the left. Use the lift platform at the end to 
 go  up,  go through the door back out into the open to where the  large 
lift platform is.

Get  on  the lift platform and go up.  Go though the doorway  and  turn 
left, kill the technician and pick up the ammo. Turn around and pick up 
the shield, go through the door and continue forward.

DO NOT TURN RIGHT... Go through the left hand door, kill the 2 soldiers 
and  pick up the medikits.  To the left is a terminal on the wall and a 
transporter pad.  Save the game here. Use the transporter pad to get to 
another area.

You are now in a room with pillars, there is a corridor to the left and 
right,  go down the left hand one. A short way down you'll find a large 
alcove on the right,  there is a geiger counter here,  pick it up. Wait 
until  a  trolley  comes  into this area and  follow  it  back  up  the 
corridor.

Before  you  get to where the corridor narrows,  put on  the  radiation 
suit.  Follow  the  trolley until you get to a couple of small  alcoves 
just  past a grating in the right hand wall,  duck into the right  hand 
alcove,  pick  up  the shield (a secret area is just here).  Wait  here 
until the trolley goes back down the corridor.

Continue  up  a  corridor and take off the  radiation  suit.  There  is 
another  corridor  that  joins it from the left,  this  is  a  circular 
corridor  and it has a train that travels around it continually.  Carry 
on  along  until you see another corridor on the left and go  down  it. 
Kill a couple of soldiers and pick up the ammo, medikits and shields.

To the left is a small room with a pit in one corner,  do not under any 
circumstances  drop down into this pit,  there is no way to get out  of 
it.  Continue  along  and around,  kill the technician and pick up  the 
medikit,  keep  following  the  corridor until you see a  door  with  a 
terminal next to it. Save the game here.

You are now at the door that leads to the inner reactor area,  and this 
 is where the walkthrough ends...ahhhh

Before I go I'll give you some hints that will help you.

You  only  need  to wear the radiation suit when you are  in  the  main 
corridor that surrounds the inner reactor area. If you start to run out 
of  radiation suit you'll find another one in one of the rooms just  up 
from the terminal.

There  are some invisibility power up's hidden in the rooms,  look  for 
them as they do come in handy.  Some of the rooms have a lot of enemies 
in them.

To complete the secondary mission you only have to walk into the  inner 
reactor.  You don't need the yellow key to get to the exit, look at the 
BIG HINT FOR LATER.  Picking up the yellow key sets off a self destruct 
timer.  To  get  out of here and back out into the open to try the  big 
hint just follow the long corridor all the way down.
