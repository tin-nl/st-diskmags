 Abstract 

How  happening  is the Atari scene,  nowadays,  when it comes to  club-
sponsored  exhibitions and gatherings?   Of course,  everyone remembers 
those  days  when every major city hosted an Atari Fest  of  some  sort 
which  typically  attracted hundreds or,  in some cases,  thousands  of 
Atari  fanatics  to discover the latest software releases  or  hardware 
hacks,  but  it  often  seems the last time those happened  was  Before 
Christ...

Obviously,  the  glorious days are long gone,  but there are still some 
dedicated user groups who recite the Reboot according to Sam Tramiel en 
masse and the Swedish Atari Club is one of the most visibles  remaining 
to day, thanks largely to its resourceful organiser Mille Babic.

This  year's  Nordic Atari Show's theme was:   Networking.   During the 
June 11-13 weekend, various people (including yours truly) demonstrated 
how  practical  one's  aging  ST,  TT or Falcon can be,  when  used  in 
conjunction with other platforms within an Intranet and what advantages 
some of the TOS networking software has over its flashier competition.

My  own  tentatively scheduled presentation was:   Networking with  NMD 
using  MiNTnet  and Unix servers.   Unfortunately,  thanks to the  nice 
folks  at  the Finnish customs,  the Riebl Ethernet card I had  ordered 
from  Best Electronics arrived just minutes after my departure from  my 
hometown.   Said the text message on my mobile,  delivered on the train 
to Helsinki:


10-Jun-99 13:50:53 Tomi, You just received a box of something from Best 
Electronics, USA.


This meant that the networking part of my speech would have to be  left 
out.... @#$! voi Perkele Jumalauta!!!  [*snip* Sorry, no Finnish humour 
allowed here]


 Export 

The  outgoing  trip  in itself was pretty uneventful:   I ran  into  my 
dayjob's  marketing director in Helsinki Central and met  the  Fishpool 
guys  for  a quick snack,  then joined #atari fanatic Pahartik  on  the 
ferry  to Stockholm where we then took the train to the  Swedish  west-
coast city of Goumlteborg.


 Memorable quotes: 

Setok:  "There's really only one type of girls you're likely to meet on 
Silja [ferry] Lines: the ritsy, posh Swedish babe."

Pahartik:   "Remember that "posh" female we saw yesterday? I heard some 
funny  noises  coming out of the women's bathroom near  the  disco  and 
there  she  was,  mumbling something like 'OK,  you can come out honey, 
there's nobody here!'"

Q-Funk:   "Man! Forget about the sterile design and crawly speed of the 
Finnish Pendolino or the tight seats of the Canadian LRC, those Swedish 
X2000  trains are the quintessence of Scandianvian comfort and  design.  
Where can I buy one?"

We  arrived in Goumlteborg early-afternoon and met up  with  organizers 
Mille Babic, Jonas M&ouml;ller Nielsen and Erik Haumlill after a rather 
pleasant  10-minute  tramway  ride  through a  downtown  area  that  is 
currently undergoing MAJOR reconstruction (Mille later told us that  it 
was the very last weekend for those trams, prior to a complete overhaul 
of  the  nearest  terminal that is expected to last until  the  end  of 
summer - lucky us, NAS happened before the deadline!).

After  unpacking my TT and Pahartik's SparcStation IPC,  we headed  out 
for a curry in company of another SAK member and then wasted the better 
part  of the evening trying to get a PPP connection between my  TT  and 
Kenneth  Medin's  STinG  subnet (using null-modem),  but  all  attempts 
failed  miserably (but mummy,  it works fine using MiNTnet machines  at 
home?!) which made him comment later:  "Hey,  I'm gonna start an ISP of 
my own and call it SLIPNET.  It's free for any MiNTnet user who manages 
to get it runing!"

Voi vittu @#$%!.... [Censored by Net Nanny]


 Config 

Anyhow,  my revenge came the following day,  when I closed an afternoon 
of MiNTnet seminars by introducing the concepts behind my new  upcoming 
MiNT distribution,  NMD (New MiNT Distribution - but Jonas said "Oh, we 
thought it meant NAS MiNT Distribution!" *grin*)

I started by first brushing an historical overview of the previous  TAF 
and  KGMD  distributions and then explained the reasons why  one  would 
prefer  NMD,  then  veered off into a complete Unix 101 course  on  the 
filesystem  hierarchy  that morphed into a full expose on the  FHS  2.0 
standard implemented in NMD.


 Reboot 

Now,  children,  normally,  Unkle Funk is rather well-behaved but,  for 
some  reason,  things  got slightly out of hands,  as he went on waxing 
poetic  about  the merits of an "old,  obsolete,  deprecated ST running 
MiNT  virtual consoles with Pine or Mutt to access the Internet over  a 
clean,  sharp,  user-friendly hi-resolution SM124 that one can purchase 
from the local pawn shop or flea market for a mere $20 bucks along with 
its  accompanying ST (batteries not included) ..." and compared  it  to 
"those brilliant Millenium 333 GHz running Windows 1901 for this  oh-so 
fast networked Quake game that your eyes cannot see the players  moving 
on  the screen,  because the graphics card has "only" 128 MB of  MPEG-5 
video RAM..."

This  eventually went off-track completely,  as I mumbled over how many 
years it took me to find one place to get myself the hardware I need to 
keep my Atari productive (graphics card, Ethernet adapter, etc.) and as 
to  why some MagiC applications I love could not be  N.AES-friendly  or 
vice-versa...  mostly  how  the  lack  of current  standards  on  Atari 
(compared  to Finder / Mac-PPP or Windows / Winsock,  which are cast in 
concrete and determined by a central authority) make it this much  more 
difficult for people to write a piece of software that will work on any 
remaining TOS system on the planet.

Apparently,  it raised many open issues about the lacking compatibility 
between  STinG,  MiNTnet  and  I-Connect  and how  this  restricts  the 
selection  of  Internet clients one gets,  because the authors have  to 
make  a  choice about which AES and TCP/IP they  will  support.   Sure, 
there  are the ATACK brothers who take the time to make separate  STinG 
and  MiNTnet  versions,  but  most authors cannot be bothered  so  this 
leaves the user with a difficult choice as well.

Anyhow,  the  point was well-taken by the attending crowd and my speech 
ended gracefuly, but still... sleep deprivation or something... I could 
have been better prepared, I suppose. *grin*


 Syslog 

After many years of reading someone's e-mails, IRC chats and newsposts, 
it's  always nice to finally put a face to a familiar name and NAS  was 
no exception. For the first time, I had the chance to meet the likes of 
Mille  Babic,  Martin Graiter and several new IRC #atari regulars  that 
poped  in since a couple of years and a few other people we  befriended 
with (unfortunately, STinG co-author Ronald Andersson was missing).

Other items worth mentioning were:

 A couple of heavily souped-up Hades 060 (Hi Erik and Jonas!).
 Quite a few TTs with various VME gizmos installed.
 Lots of ST gear for sale (everyone and myself rushed in  to  purchase 
 some brand new Scandinavian MEGA-ST keyboards Jan Persson had for sale 
 - at 95 SEK, it was a bargain I just couldn't pass up!).
 Several recased Falcons on which really cool demo coding was performed
 by the Nature crew (heid & aring!).
 SAK's brilliant barcode-based ID card system, for an easier visitor
 login/logout procedure.

Looking  back,  I  think  I  actually  enjoyed  NAS  much  better  than 
Alternative Party, mainly because this time I had my TT to thinker with 
(and  write this article,  between the sightseeing and chatting  bits), 
while  I  basically  came empty-handed with just  a  backpack  full  of 
clothes at ALT.

Also,  as  the Reservoir Gods' experience proves (they decided to  code 
their  amazing Frogger clone "Bugger!" after playing the original  game 
at ALT), a lot of inspiration comes out of these gatherings and NAS was 
no  exception.  Look for the results in the installation package of NMD 
"coming  soon to an FTP site near you;  check your local newsgroup  for 
upload times."

Otherwise,  the  crowd there was friendly and generous,  the train ride 
really fun and the variety of restaurants found within walking distance 
utterly  cool.  Finding  that brand new Scandinavian MEGA keyboard  was 
also  God  sent,  given I nowadays need those extra vowels on  a  daily 
basis.

Pahartik  also  enjoyed the trip quite a bit,  especially the  tax-free 
shops  on  the  ferry (quiz:   what does a Finn always  buys  in  large 
quantities,  in  order  to  initiate  "party" mode?)  and  the  Krishna 
restaurant where we ate on Saturday (me thinks of a long time ago, in a 
country far,  far away,  where he used to enjoy the prasadam on a daily 
basis and God saw it and thought it was Funky).

 Anyhow,  too bad the Brits couldn't make it,  but watch for more Maggie 
reports over the next Finnish gathering in their Atari Computing column 
and in this e-zine.

Moikka! ;-)
