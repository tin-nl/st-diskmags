                          What's in, what's up? 

There WILL be a Tenth Anniversary issue of Maggie next year!

There WON'T be an issue before that!

Planning  for the tenth anniversary has started,  there has even been a 
date  provisionally set for this,  the weekend of the 19th August 2000. 
Between  now and then,  work on a tenth anniversary special issue  will 
consume most of our available 'Maggie-ing' time until then.  Due to the 
very  long time this issue took to escape from Maggie GHQ,  any thought 
of an 'in-between' issue sort of died.

That's  all  well and good,  but what might a tenth  anniversary  issue 
contain then?

Quite  apart from the usual thrills and spills,  there will be a lot of 
material of a commemorative nature.  A 'life and times of Maggie' guide 
will be in there, possibly along the lines of the ST News A-Z reference 
guide.  A  whole  host  of amusingly witty looking back over  the  past 
decade  type  articles  should squeeze in there as  well.  We  will  be 
soliciting views and reactions from all sorts of different people,  and 
trying  to get crusty old 'scene' veterans to write in.  You know,  the 
sort  of  people who would willingly make horizontal scrollers  go  all 
wibbly-wobbly  in  past  days,  but are now probably all  married  with 
children.

There  will  be as much of the usual news and reviews we  can  get  our 
hands on by then, and we are also hoping to attend the odd party or two 
by then.  The SV2000 in Gdansk,  in April, looks pretty definite at the 
minute. Expect the usual report/realtime based thrills from there!

Coming  back  to the year 10 issue,  we will be trying to get  as  many 
contributors, past and present involved, even at gunpoint if necessary, 
and we are really hoping for this issue to be along the lines of 'extra 
large'. So if the present day readers feel like joining in the fun that 
is to be the tenth anniversary issue, then don't hold back!

We  are  trying for a definite release date for this  one,  which  will 
hopefully  be  the weekend of the 19th-20th August 2000.  This  is  why 
we're  giving  ourselves  loads of time to do it!  Although,  going  by 
current release schedules,  this may not actually hit the streets until 
six months later?

Staying on the subject of 10th anniversary happenings,  we are actively 
thinking of some sort of party or event to commemorate the 10th year.

No  firm  plans  yet,  but it will be on the weekend of  the  19th-20th 
August  next year (pause for massed rustlings of people  searching  for 
diaries!)  The venue is undecided,  but is most likely to be "somewhere 
in the middle of England." This party,  if it happens,  is likely to be 
small-scale,  so not quite on the scale of Error in Line.  However,  if 
you  are a non-UK scene person,  who happens to be in the area on  that 
weekend, you're more than welcome to drop in. (If you are wanting to be 
there for the 19th to 20th August, then please email me soon.)
