 Customer claim for being the subject of witchcraft and loss of gravity

 This was pinched out of the staff magazine at work, not normally noted 
for  being a great repository of humour,  but this apparently  genuine 
letter  from a customer was printed in there.  The customer is thought 
to  be  inhabiting their own little world with the  clangers  and  the 
soupdragon... - CiH, Nov '97

The  insured  identified herself as Mrs J***** who was  in  her  early 
'fifties  at the time of the claims.  She has lived in this house  for 
the last fifteen years or so,  and has two children,  now grown up, by 
day  but twenty-six at night.  She indicated to the adjuster that  she 
was currently pregnant but does not know how this happened.

In  her spare time the insured also acts as Queen of  Wales,  Princess 
Margaret,  and  the  Queen.  The adjuster was advised that it was best 
that  this  did  not become public knowledge in the  interest  of  the 
adjusters health.

In  the autumn of the year in question the insured noticed that  there 
seemed  to be a difference in the size of her three piece  suite  from 
what she remembered it to be.  She had also noticed some scratching to 
the top of her cooker that had been purchased a week earlier.

She then rang the police. They confirmed that there was no sign of any 
forced entry or exit.

There was scratching to the top of the cooker located in the  kitchen. 
The  insured  also reported an apparent shrinkage of a  single  seater 
chair  forming  part of a three piece suite when compared to  the  two 
seater located on the opposite side of the room.  Although the insured 
appreciates  that the difference is only negligible,  she is insistent 
that  it  is replaced.  The insured suspects the suite may not be  the 
original  that she purchased some ten years ago as it had  been  taken 
away, and a poorer quality one substituted by 'nasty people'.

For some reason, the police have decided to take no further action.

The  insured has claimed œ599.99 in respect of the three piece  suite, 
although  there  appears to be no claim for the  cooker.  The  insured 
indicated  that  damage to the cooker was occasioned when  it  floated 
through  the air.  The insured believes that this occurred as a result 
of  its loss of gravity.  Alternative explanations of either ghosts or 
poltergeists were also offered.

So what happened next?
  
Well,  when  we received the report from our adjusters you can imagine 
that  we had to take this very seriously indeed.  We were particularly 
put  out that the police had decided not to pursue  the  investigation 
any further.

In  the end we concluded that loss of gravity and witchcraft were  not 
covered under the terms of the policy and wrote a nice letter to  that 
effect.  We didn't hear any more than this, although for quite a while 
afterwards,  a  number of staff in the office did complain of  feeling 
sharp stabbing pains in various parts of their anatomy, although these 
too have now passed.
