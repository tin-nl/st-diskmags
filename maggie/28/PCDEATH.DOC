Many  computer  users  perform  their  own  hardware  upgrades,  and  a 
distressing  number  of  these result in  insufficient  damage  to  the 
system.  Destroying  your own computer is every user's right and is the 
pattern  of  behaviour expected by the manufacturers  and,  especially, 
repair personnel,  whose very livelihood is put in peril by those users 
who perversely persist in correctly upgrading their equipment.
    
This  article  will explain to you,  the user,  the most common ways by 
which  you  can cause your computer to cease to  function.  Follow  the 
instructions  carefully  and  you will  shortly  find  yourself  making 
appropriate contributions to the all-important service sector.
    
First, it is essential to be incorrectly prepared.
    
When opening the case of your computer,  you will probably be presented 
with  a number of hexagonal head Phillips-slotted screws.  These can be 
easily removed with a Phillips screwdriver or 6mm nut driver, but using 
a  flathead  screwdriver,  especially  one that is  slightly  too  big, 
maximises  the chance of the screwdriver slipping from the  screw  head 
and smashing into one or another of the computer's connectors. Personal 
injury  is  also possible,  especially if excessive force is used  when 
turning  a  screw  the  wrong way,  but the object  is  to  damage  the 
computer, not yourself.
    
If  any  components of your computer are held in  place  with  Pozidriv 
screws (superficially similar to Phillips head screws, but recognisable 
by the cross scored on the screw-head at 45 degrees to the slots),  use 
of a Phillips head driver instead of the squarer tipped Pozidriv  gives 
the  maximum  chance  of reaming out the screw  head  and,  with  luck, 
damaging the driver as well.
    
When  removing screws from the back of an ordinary clone  case,  ensure 
that  you  extract every screw in sight,  not just the ones around  the 
edge that actually hold the case on.  This will,  with any luck,  cause 
the  computer's  power  supply to fall off inside the  case  and  cause 
serious damage, before you even have to take off the lid.
    
Leaving  one  fastening  screw still done up in  the  corner  and  then 
attempting  to wrench off the case may cause significant damage to  the 
metalwork,  but  this is generally easily bent back into shape and  not 
very expensive to replace. You can do better.     

Fortunately,  there  are  a  plethora of computer case designs,  and  a 
gratifying   number  are  fiendishly  difficult  to  take  apart   and, 
especially,  reassemble.  To maximise the chance of damage,  ignore any 
locking tabs and slots,  don't worry about pinching cables in the case, 
and make sure you push really hard.
    
When  replacing  screws,  remember  to  tighten everything  as  if  the 
computer  were  a  major structural component  of  the  Sydney  Harbour 
Bridge.  Overtightening  screws  increases  the chance of  reaming  the 
heads,  and  the  extra  frustration involved in  removing  super-tight 
screws  increases  the chance that someone will give up  and  turn  the 
machine  over to a professional.  Use of an electric screwdriver  makes 
screw  destruction easy for anyone.  Use of computer cases as furniture 
is an excellent way to obey your entropic imperatives. 

Many PC cases are in fact very strong, and so it's necessary to balance 
large monitors, tabletops, grand pianos and twelve foot fireproof safes 
upon  them  to ensure rapid destruction.  Fortunately,  the pop-riveted 
construction of most cases and their poor endurance under lateral loads 
means  that  even  relatively  small stresses  can,  over  time,  cause 
sufficient  structural  creep to snap a solidly  attached  motherboard. 
Patience, and not buying enough chairs, can be a virtue.

     Static Is Your Friend!  

It  is possible to destroy computer components just by  touching  them, 
thanks to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Static electricity accumulates 
best on humans when the air is dry and both the carpet and the soles of 
the shoes are made of synthetic materials.
    
Unfortunately,  static discharge damage is actually a fairly rare cause 
of computer problems.  On the bright side,  however, a discharge as low 
as 200 volts is sufficient to destroy a chip,  and this level of charge 
can  easily  be  accumulated  in just a few  steps  on  carpet.  Static 
discharge can only be felt when the charge gets up around the 2000 volt 
mark,  so  it's possible for a truly adept user to unknowingly  destroy 
several components in one session.
    
If  the  user employs an anti-static discharge strap  connected  to  an 
earthed  object  or  simply  leaves  the  computer  plugged  in   (thus 
maintaining the chassis earth connection) and takes care to touch  some 
exposed  metal  on the power supply  before  handling  static-sensitive 
components  (and  periodically during the job),  the chance  of  static 
damage becomes depressingly low.
    
Old-fashioned  belt-drive  vacuum cleaners are quite  efficient  static 
electricity generators, so cleaning computer componentry with one is an 
excellent  way  to  bolster the income of  a  service  engineer.  Newer 
cleaners  are  still good at accumulating static,  and are  also  quite 
powerful  enough  to  seriously damage fragile  components  with  sheer 
suction. 

     Air force! 

Electronics  stores  stock  canned  "air  duster",  which  is  actually 
compressed  difluoroethane  gas,  and  can  be used  to  clean  various 
devices. Air duster is quite useful for cleaning more robust items, but 
can also be usefully employed in computer destruction, where it is more 
than  capable  of  blowing  chips out  of  sockets,  spinning  fans  to 
prodigious speeds and destroying their tiny brushless motor assemblies, 
and,   of  course,   redistributing  dust  from  relatively  accessible 
locations  to far more exciting ones,  like deep inside expansion  card 
connectors and CD-ROM drives.

For truly powerful air-blasting,  though, the discerning user will have 
to  employ  the  services of an air compressor.  These  can  be  rented 
cheaply  from many equipment hire shops,  and as well as their  greater 
power (which can snap a RAM module and its socket right off the  board) 
offer the added bonus of high-speed water delivery,  provided of course 
that  the  user  makes sure not to use  the  condensation  drain  valve 
provided for less focussed operators.

     Get it wet! 

Contact  with plain water is surprisingly unlikely to destroy  computer 
componentry,  unless  the  device in question is left wet for a  while. 
Beverages  like  coffee,  tea  and  (especially)  cola  are  much  more 
effective, and so it is important to have a tall, unstable container of 
one or more of these within elbowing distance of the work area.  Crumbs 
of  food  can  foul  connectors and  floppy  drive  moving  parts,  but 
intensive  open-mouthed  chewing over the computer is  required  for  a 
reliable kill.

     Killing chips! 

If  the job involves inserting or removing socketed chips,  the options 
for destruction of expensive devices open up enormously.
    
Inserting  and  removing Pin Grid Array (PGA) processor chips  in  Zero 
Insertion Force (ZIF) sockets is unlikely to break anything, unless the 
user  somehow manages not to operate the locking lever and  forces  the 
issue.  PGA  chips in old-style sockets are easier to damage;  PGA pins 
are annoyingly hard to bend, but the forest of pins under the processor 
gives many chances to bend just one and make the chip uninsertable.

If  the computer is an 80486-based system,  the Central Processing Unit 
(CPU)  can be plugged into its socket in more than one way.  One corner 
of the processor is bevelled and the matching corner of the socket will 
also be marked,  but if these markings are disregarded - or if the user 
decides  instead  to line up the printing on the CPU with that  on  the 
motherboard  - then the processor can be inserted in one of  the  three 
other alignments.  This makes the chip's destruction, possibly with the 
emission  of  smoke,  quite  likely.  Intel regrettably made  processor 
misalignment  impossible with the introduction of the  Pentium  series, 
unless of course the enterprising user is equipped with a mallet.
    
Conventional Dual Inline Package (DIP) chips,  with a row of pins along 
either side, are much more gratifyingly susceptible to damage.
    
The  very best tool for bending and breaking pins on DIP chips  is  the 
inexpensive  springy "chip extractor" available at various  electronics 
stores.  U-shaped,  the steel tool has an inward bent lip on the end of 
each leg, and is designed to hook both ends of a chip at once, and give 
the user the impression that it will in fact extract both ends at once.
    
This never happens.
   
When  one end of the (usually very firmly inserted) chip comes  out  of 
the socket, the considerable pull being exerted by the user immediately 
causes that end to be lifted well clear of the board while the last few 
ranks  of pins are still plugged in,  resulting in badly bent or broken 
pins  which  are  difficult to bend back and very,  very  difficult  to 
repair.
    
Truly adept users can also hook a DIP chip extractor under the  socket, 
not the chip, and bodily rip it from its soldered-in location. This can 
lift  tracks from the board and render it practically  irreparable,  if 
done with sufficient gusto.
    
Chips are much less likely to be damaged if a small screwdriver is used 
to  lever each end in turn up a little at a time,  until the whole chip 
comes  free  at  once.  Those who have purchased stock in  chip  makers 
recommend against this strategy.
    
The other common kind of chip package is Plastic Leadless Chip  Carrier 
(PLCC),  which  is square with a row of contacts on each side and which 
fits  into  a socket somewhat reminiscent of an  above-ground  swimming 
pool.  It  is  difficult to insert these chips incorrectly,  since  one 
corner  is bevelled so they can only fit into the socket one  way,  and 
firm pressure snaps them into place annoyingly reliably.
    
It is also hard to break PLCC chips when removing them; a purpose-built 
PLCC  extractor does it in a snap and has none of the redeeming  danger 
of  the  DIP extracting tools,  and removing PLCCs by prying under  the 
corners  with  a  very  small screwdriver is  annoying,  but  not  very 
hazardous.  Fortunately, users seldom have to work with PLCC chips, and 
the other types are satisfyingly easy to break.
    
Inserting  Single  Inline Memory Modules (SIMMs) should  be  relatively 
simple,  since SIMM sockets require one only to insert the module at an 
angle,  then swing it upright until the locking clips click into place. 
Fortunately,  many  PCs  are cramped inside and have at least one  SIMM 
socket  fouled by the power supply or other metalwork,  making it  more 
difficult to insert a memory module in that socket without damaging  it 
or  the  socket.  Inserting  modules backwards (even  though  they  are 
designed not to fit that way), jamming them straight in vertically and, 
of   course,   using  plenty  of  force,   increase  the  chance  of  a 
misadventure.

     Cables, connectors and calamity! 

Ribbon  cables are often difficult to plug in incorrectly,  because the 
connectors  they  go into are "keyed" to match the cable  in  only  one 
orientation.  If  a  ribbon cable plugs into a bare pin header with  no 
surround,  though, damage can result if the user takes note of the tiny 
"1" often printed on the circuit board by the connector to indicate pin 
one,  and  also  takes note of the stripe on the cable which  indicates 
which  side is should connect to pin one,  and reverses the  connector. 

Incompetently  made  cables  with  one end  backwards  make  this  much 
simpler.  Note  that reversing a cable at BOTH ends is likely to result 
in  perfect  operation of the hardware,  which is not the aim  of  this 
exercise.

If the pin header on the motherboard isn't "shrouded" -surrounded by  a 
plastic  box to correctly align the plug - the intrepid user can  quite 
easily  connect the plug in such a way as to miss one row or column  of 
pins.  This  can  very excitingly change the details of the  connection 
being made.

When connecting an older style, "AT" power supply to a motherboard, the 
two-part   power   connector  offers  a  marvellous   opportunity   for 
destruction.  Make  sure  at all costs to avoid the plug  configuration 
shown below.
    
This configuration, with the black wires towards the centre, will cause 
the computer to work perfectly. Reversing the two plugs so that the red
wires   are  towards  the  centre  will,   gratifyingly,   destroy  the 
motherboard.  Some  manufacturers appear to have temporarily  abandoned 
their  sanity  and  made  AT power supplies that  will  not  work  when 
connected incorrectly.  Such supplies are,  of course, to be avoided if 
at all possible.

Fortunately,  modern  motherboards  have introduced a new way to  blast 
tracks  clean off the board.  On-board fan connectors have three  pins, 
and two adjacent ones are the positive and ground supply. Mistaking one 
of  these connectors for a motherboard configuration jumper allows  the 
adept user to slip a jumper block onto the fan connector and short  the 
positive  pin  to  ground,  which can and will burn out traces  on  the 
motherboard and render it useful only as a wall decoration. Motherboard 
manufacturers are clearly aware of this possibility, and some assist by 
labelling,  say,  a  three  pin  CMOS clearing jumper block "JP2",  and 
marking  the CPU fan connector "J2".  The use of the normal motherboard 
annotation font (one point Flyspeck Sans Serif) makes misidentification 
simple even for those with perfect vision.

Plugging and unplugging peripherals that attach to computer ports while 
the machine is turned on is unlikely to damage the peripherals and  not 
much more likely to damage the computer - plugging and unplugging cards 
inside  the  .computer  when it's on is a much  better  way  to  damage 
things.
    
If, in the course of diagnosing a problem, you have a hard drive out of 
its assigned bay and resting on top of the open machine,  remember that 
the logic board under the drive can generally be shorted out easily  by 
chassis   metalwork   and   position  the   device   accordingly.   

     PSU pulverisation! 

Power supplies can be obliterated in a number of ways.

The  simplest is provided by the ubiquitous voltage selector switch  on 
the back.  If the user is lucky enough to reside in a country where the 
mains  supply is 220V or higher,  switching a computer PSU to the  110V 
setting  will  result in a satisfyingly exploded supply,  and  possible 
considerable secondary damage.

In  comparison,  the more pedestrian sport of dropping screws into  the 
PSU  fan  in  hopes that they will cause a dramatic  short  circuit  is 
scarcely necessary. Particularly in view of the fact that the fan often 
spits them back out.

Remember - slapdash,  ill-informed, incompetent work is what's expected 
of you. Don't let the industry down!
