Minister John's most recent sermon; 'The Evil Bull'.

Oh no!  A volcano has erupted in my mansion...

Whoosh! goes the lava
all over me shirt
and it all slops down
with leering vengence.

Hot and sticky
and horrible and runny
and the thick black smoke
spews up in the air.

Through this dimness
a spectre emerges
it's a great big bull
with a horrible head.

And his eyes bug out
and his lips is curled
with two metal horns
and high-heeled shoes.

"Yin yin yin
yin yin yin"

He emits the aweful
belch of wrath
he emerges from the ground
and he begins to shreak.

Well he is big and brassy
with golden legs
I must fight this devil
before he steals my eggs.

"Yin yin yin
yin yin yin.
Yin yin yin
yin yin yin"

There is uproar in my mind
and uproar in my lounge
and my seventeen babies
begin to howl.

Then he beckons to me
and he bids me hark
Oh, he's horrible, demonic
and he starts to spit...

"I am the Bull of Death,
have I got a prize for you, sir.
I am the Bull of Death,
have I got a prize for you, sir."

Well I couldn't resist
so I clubbed him with me shovel.
And that spelled one thing
i.e. trouble.

It didn't make him froth
and it never make him whistle
Why, he mearly tittered
and began to sing.

He said...
"Yin yin yin
I am not thin.
Yin yin yin
I am not thin."

Then I wrestled with him
I wrestled him I say
I stuck the boot in
and he stuck his hoof in.

My, how I struggled
against his tallons of destruction...

And then the beast said...
"Come with me to Paris.
Why not come with me to Paris?
Come with me to Paris.
COME WITH ME TO PARIS!"

Off then I trekked
into the hell-hole
looking like a nutter
and feeling kind of dreamy.

I got to Paris
I had a look about
I watched the telly
I ate some jelly
I listned to the rumble
in my big fat belly
I donned my bonnet
and I lit up my pipe
At last I was a bull
so I began to hum...

I said...
"Yin yin yin
I am not thin.
Yin yin yin
I am not thin."
