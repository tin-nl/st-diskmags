(DEMOS)
                         ====================                         
                         DEMOS and ANIMATIONS
                         ====================

Ref: 010
3DTT demo originally designed for the Atari TT it is a fine showcase
of true fast vector graphics.  BIRDY is an animation from Brainstorm
of France featuring a 256 colour ray-traced birdy going for a walk
down the street!  TERMINAL F**K UP by Sanity, watch as your screen is
taken for a blast in this early but impressive demo.  PARAGON demo is
a simple but colourful affair featuing gouraud shaded vector objects
and you can add your own sample too.  Finally there is Griffs
Protracker replayer on this disk along with 3 JPEG format pictures
but no viewer.  This disk was rated 72% in ST Format magazine and
features some of the first ever Falcon demos.

Ref: 014
CEBIT 93 demo is a basic but nice demo with a good soundtrack.  Watch
as the stars and letters scroll around then the peeping hole shows
off a lovely lady underneath!  RGB only.  The BLACK SCORPION DEMOS
feature two versions of their clever PLASMA screens, the SPEEDER demo
which lets you fly this craft around a SNES mode-7 style landscape
and INTEL INBIN telling a colourful message!  RGB only.  Cebit is an
LZH file and BSS a ZIP file, UNLZH included.

Ref: 021
OMEGA GROTESQUE demo featuring a 'rave' soundtrack and lots of
dancing people and other clever effects.  RGB only.  The RED SECTOR
INTRO is from a cracked game and has a nice logo and module.  RGB
only.  The LEFT DONUGHT demo from Griff features a great interpolated
module, nice raytraced picture and clever gouraud shaded vectors. 
RGB only.  F UK MOI 1 and 2 some odd colour wizardry.  RGB only.

Ref: 025
HUMANS DEMO this is a multiple animation of the forthcoming game
Humans on the Falcon (or probably called Dino Dudes when released). 
There are some amusing little animations here all in nice 256
colours.  You will need a hard drive and 4 meg and its RGB only.

Ref: 026
HUMANS DEMO DISK TWO.  This _is_ needed for the above demo.  It has
been zipped up to save space and both parts are required.

Ref: 028
MORPHING ANIMATION this is a sample from the forthcoming Chroma
Studio 24 from Black Scorpion Software.  Watch as two faces morph
into each other!  Quite freaky really.  Morph patch included so now
works on VGA and RGB monitors.  BLAT a clever and wonderful little
game in the columns ilk, good sounds and addictive gameplay.

Ref: 029
NEW POWER GENERATION DENTRO this is a nice first attempt from the
680XX convention in Hamburg, featuring a brilliant vector dot star
tunnel and real time overscan fractals.  RGB only.  SHADE BOBS is
quite mesmerising really!  Colourful fun and with a nice soundtrack
to boot.  GFX displays a really superb true colour picture which
cannot be described but is of a fantasy origin.  RGB only.  WHEN
DREAMS BECOME REALITY is the final demo and features some excellent
graphics and effects including a cube rotated in real time with a
true colour picture on each face.  RGB only.

Ref: 030
RAYTRACED FUJI DEMO this is an amazing raytraced animation featuring
a spotlight rotating around and lighting up a Fuji logo amoungst
other things, this is a massive ZIP file and is RGB only.  For music
freaks there is the TUBULAR BELLS demo, no graphics, no text, just a
wonderful rendition of Mike Oldfields classic in 16-bit Stereo.

Ref: 044
LEMANS ANIMATION is another Brainstorm product and fills an entire
disk on its own, there is a nice (suitble!) looped sample and a mini
screen featuring cars crashing and smashing all over the place.

Ref: 045
STEALTH FLI ANIMATION.  This is another big animation, but this 256
colour PC port-over is really very special and features a stealth
fighter plane taking off, zooming around then landing again.  Very
clever indeed.  FLI player included.

Ref: 046
CRIME DEMO is a brilliant little demo from the DNT crew and has some
wicked effects including shade bobs, real time light-sourced vectors,
true colour fractals, bouncing jello balls, sinus dots and more.  RGB
only.  NETHACK ok so this isn't really a demo but its on this disk so
you will have to put up with it!  This is a more friendly version of
the age-old classic text based RPG game Hack.  You will need 2 meg at
least and run it in hi-res mode, best suited to a VGA monitor. 
VERTICAL MAYHEM is a brilliant columns clone written by Griff of
Electronic Images, rated 78% by ST Format.

Ref: 047
GEOTECH is a plasma landscape generator, you can't save them though. 
RGB only.  HANDS and MOUSE are two more amusing animations, hands
features an on-going morph as one shape blends into the next, mouse
shows a mouse getting the fright of its life, both backed with good
samples.  MOD CODE is the 68000 assembler source code required for
playing back a soundtracker module.

Ref: 051
PENTAGON is a nice RGB or VGA demo, it doesn't have some of the more
impressive effects of the newer demos but it still can strut its
stuff along with the rest of them.  Its soundtrack is a nice touch. 
WARUM demo by Lazer is superb with some nifty graphical trickery,
good graphics and good soundtrack.  RGB only.  MINI's are a
collection of little RGB only demos including shade bobs, true colour
sprites and rasters.

Ref: 052
GEM and WAX vector demos, a nice module and lots and lots of vector
graphics for you to move your way through, watch planes fly and odd
boxes rotate!  RGB only.  DSP FRACTAL creator will do just that! 
Make fractals using the brute force of the DSP chip.  INCONVEX is
another small 'tester' demo, RGB only.  MAGNET9 creates more colour
wobbling madness on your screen (RGB only) and finally MJJPROD is a
nice mix of a few little sections and some OK music but it crackles a
lot for my liking!  This is also RGB only.

Ref: 056
FRACTAL FLIGHT by Opium of France kicks up with a great looped sample
of 'What is Love' by Haddaway and then proceeds to fling you across
this fractal landscape much like some of the PC games do!  RGB only. 
COOL is a nice shade bob demo by EKO (my personal favourites) and is
RGB only (as expected).

Ref: 057
CHROME DRAGON is another giga-feast from Opium of France.  There are
many many effects in this one hidden deep in the demo and backed with
a wonderful soundtracker module.  Also on this disk is EKO's (yeah!)
technically top notch demo PAPA WAS A BLADERUNNER, featuring a
booming sample from the Orb's Fluffy Clouds the demo slides you into
all manner of clever and entrancing effects including some nifty
z-buffering (as seen in Cybermorph on the Jaguar!).  Impressive stuf.
 Both demos are RGB only.

Ref: 058
BIG DIGI DEMO has a few tracks from the BIG demo by TEX (The
Exceptions) from many years back on the ST and to be honest its crap!
EXTRO is a nice little intro featuring a busty cartoon warrior and
bouncing scroll text.  SHADE VECTORS is, well, exactly that!  Also
known as Tats Tiny True Colour Test!  CONFLICT is a very nice demo
from the Dead Hackers Society, good music and good effects, RGB only.
Finally is TEKNO DEATH a wild, stomping 'rave' demo with dancing
people, swimming fish and bouncing jelly cubes!!!  Manic!!!

Ref: 060
FLI ANIMATIONS 2.  BALL is a bouncing ball!  EARTH is the globe
spinning on its x-axis and PROBE is a nice raytraced space probe
zooming in then out of the screen.  All are 256 animations.

Ref: 061
FLI ANIMATIONS 3.  PORSHE is a very well looped animation of a porshe
in a car show being rotated around infront of you, amazing.  INVOKE
is a bizarre animation of a chrome lady willing this box to morph
into a ball and back again!  Odd but lovely.

Ref: 062
FLI ANIMATIONS 4.  PLAYROOM is a short trip into a virtual reality
fun centre!  Watch as the monitor screens blip into life and the room
rotates around, too short.  PENGUIN features a bizarre wobbling
penguin that stretches and contorts around the screen in a pecking
fashion.

Ref: 063
FLI ANIMATIONS 5.  SUPER NOVA.  Ok so you only get once animation on
this disk, and it has been packed with LZH (player and unlzh
provided) but - WOW - WHAT an animation it is!  Watch as an entire
planet goes super nova and sends shock waves rippling out into the
galaxy.

Ref: 064
FLI ANIMATIONS 6.  NEWTONS CRADLE.  Again this takes up a whole disk
but its a ray traced feast for anyones eye's as the time honured
newtons cradle bops back and forth, mirrored of course in the balls!

Ref: 065
FLI ANIMATIONS 7.  FISHY is a colourful underwater animation with
tropical fish and harpoons zooming around the place.  VOYAGER is
stunning, like the opening to a top sci-fi series on television or
something as a huge star cruiser zooms up the screen past you.

Ref: 066
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 1.  The Moving Pixels demo was constructed
for use with VGA monitors only and is really designed as a show room
show-off for the Falcon030.  As you might expect there are some very
impressive graphics and music and if that wasn't all the whole thing
talks to you constantly (the main reason for its large size).  You
will need a hard drive, VGA display and 4meg of memory.  Oh and don't
forget the other four disks too!  Yep, its that big AND it has been
ZIPped up.

Ref: 067
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 2 (required for above VGA demo).

Ref: 068
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 3 (as above).

Ref: 069
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 4 (as above).

Ref: 070
MOVING PIXELS DEMO DISK 5 (as above).

Ref: 080
GULLE AM BACH is a little DSP testing demo from EKO featuring some
nice vector dot tricks and music.  RGB only.  Also on this disk is
part one of the mammoth LAZER demo called UNGTO.  This pure beast
will unpack and require 6 MEG of your hard drive and all 4 meg of
your memory (ie not ACC's or AUTO programs).  It is also RGB only.
So what do you get for such a massive demo?  The answer is
everything!  From the stunning morphing intro animation to the fake
Unix clone (Lanix!) it throws you throw 15 minutes of PURE demo with
not a scroll text in sight.  3D worlds are explored.  Sinus dots. 
Star Tunnels.  Stunning graphics and stunning music.  If you only
ever get one demo for your Falcon, make sure its this one!  You will
not be dissapointed.

Ref: 081
LAZER UNGTO DEMO DISK 2 (ZIPped file) you will need this to complete
the set of the totally amazing demo, this is truly the Falcon coming
of age and will blow ANY Amiga demo out of the water.

Ref: 082
MARGA DEMO.  Umm yes, well, this is an odd one indeed!  It's all in
German, ie I couldn't read anything, and has some very odd jazz
sounding music and a few hi-res scanned pictures of some women that
look like they are coming out of the 1940's.  Someone let me know
what this demo is all about please!

Ref: 086
PLASTIKK VIBRATION.  Following on from their plastic origins way back
on disk 029, the NEW POWER GENERATION are back with another brain
blasting demo-extravaganzaaaa!!!  and wow is this good!  It has
everything including a fly-your-own helicopter ride over a fractal
mountain terrain!  Very clever stuff indeed and well worth getting. 
Depacks to 3.5meg on your hard drive and needs an RGB display.  Also
on this disk is the ACP module player and a new FRACTAL CREATION
utility, so play away after being dazzled by NPG.

Ref: 087
STRANGE EXPECTATIONS from New Trend is one of my all time favourite
demos on the Falcon.  For a start it opens with a HUGE scrolling ray
traced picture, the music being very well linked into this, and then
proceeds into the demo proper and throws you away amoungst the
awesome star tunnels, graphics and technical effects.  The music is
top notch too.  RGB only and an LZH packed file (unlzh NOT included).

Ref: 091
FOG ANIMATION.  Yes we have our own animation at last and boy is this
one surreal!  Watch as Garfield jumps out of your monitor and starts
playing with the mouse, watch babies cry, Falcon's fly and disks zoom
by.  It's all very odd, very clever and very entertaining.  Only uses
16 colours but still fills a meg and a half of your hard disk, VGA
and RGB.  Many thanks to John for this masterpiece!

Ref: 093
CHAOS AD 2 DEMO by the DNT crew.  They too have improved since their
last Falcon offering and CHAOS proves this big style!  50 images per
second update, full real-time calculations, 50 Khz stereo soundtrack,
384x256 and 768x512 overscanned screens in 16256 or 65536 colours. 
About 10 minutes of total brain-crash.  FRIED BITZ GRAPHICS enteries
from the Fried Bitz demo party, lots of RGB only screens with some
amazing artwork, really amazing!  Chaos is RGB only.

Ref: 094
ARRIVAL DEMO by Passion.  This is a rather average demo that does try
to show you what can be done but never seems to make it fully, still
there are a lot of good effects hidden away in here and I for one
look forward to more from the Passion crew soon.  RGB only.  DEMENTIA
by Avena has some lovely effects and storming raytraced title
picture, there is not too much to this demo, but what there is really
counts and makes up for it.  More from Avena PLEASE!  Watch out EKO!!
RGB only (of course).

Ref: 100
JAGUAR DEMO by Pure Bollocks.  This is a large demo that shows you
various screen shots from forthcoming or released Jaguar games.  They
are only in 256 colours and you can tell they have lost something,
especially the Tiny Toon's pictures.  However this is a quite nice
slideshow and its interesting to see what Jaguar owners will be
getting, I for one thought the Aliens Vs. Predator screens were
amazing!  VGA (with distortion at the bottom of the screen but
nothing too bad) and RGB.  POSITIVITY DEMO is called 'Waiting the Zik
Disk' and is a very little dentro type thing, not so good by todays
standards, it looks very STE'ish.  VOXMAIL is a demo of a complete
voice mailing package for the Falcon, why buy an answer phone when
you can let Voxmail do it for you?  Great fun to be had here!

(GAMES)
                      =============================
                      FALCON PD AND SHAREWARE GAMES
                      =============================

Ref: 020
OXYD is the now classic Dongleware game and it needs a VGA monitor in
order to play it.  Move your marble around knocking the switches to
allow safe passage into the next zone.  You will have to register if
you want to go past level 10.  A very good game indeed, nice
presentation and sound effects.  VGA only.  SPACOLA is another
Dongleware game, this time its almost like asteroids, except there
are more aliens than rocks!  Zoom around in this mono hi-res game and
waste the baddies and collect the goodies.  There are some superb
sound effects built into this one.  VGA and also RGB.

Ref: 043
Amoungst lots of other things this disk contains the game LAMEMINES
and MARIO.  Lamemines as you might expect is a version (and a very
hard one at that) of the popular PC Window's classic.  Only this time
you have a huge screen to clear and alsorts of samples!  MARIO
involves you driving what looks like a womble in a go-cart around a
track!  No skill involved, just mindless fun for a few seconds.

Ref: 046
NETHACK is the new revised edition, needs 2 meg, is best with a VGA
and is very, very large indeed!  The text based RPG characters have
been replaced with graphics and icons and I can promise you many
sleepless nights are to be had.  VERTICAL MAYHEM is a nice little
columns clone ported from the Amiga by Griff of Electronic Images.

Ref: 050
LASERS AND MEN.  This is the first ever attempt at a Wolfenstien 3D
game on the Falcon, and it works... just!  The graphics are crude at
the moment, but the playability is there.  Let's just hope they can
speed things up a little for the next version.

Ref: 053
OXYD RGB yes its the Dongleware classic but now its been fixed so it
works on RGB displays.  MAHJONG is a detailed version of the classic
board game which I am yet to work out how to play!

Ref: 054
FALCON TRON is exactly that!  No matter how nicely you dress up a
tron game with flashy graphics and sound its always going to involve
moving a line around a screen in an attempt to destroy other lines! 
Still at least this is a very nice version of it.  RGB only.  MADTRIS
is a wild and crazy idea for a game, take Tetris and make the blocks
fall in from the sides (like Welltris but not 3D!) oh its hard to
explain and even harder to play, confusing but entertaining.  RGB
only.  MASTERS OF CHAOS, now this is special - a deep and involved
Dungeon Master style game for one or two players (or 4 via link up)
plenty to do and see, nice graphics and nice sound effects.  RGB
only.

Ref: 079
TRIYAHOO this is a version of Yahtzee for the Falcon and it is more
flexible and compatible than lots of applications I can mention!  The
game involves rolling dice and making sets like a small straight or a
full house.  It is a really good game once you get into it and the
presentation is top notch as are the sound effects.  My highest score
on a three card yahtzee is 2060 - anyone beat that?  Excellent stuff!
STELLO is the most detailed game of Othello you will ever play, and
whats more you will never be able to beat the computer because it is
so damn smart!  You can even load pictures into the background of the
board (and several tasty example are provided).  Very very good but
frustratingly difficult.

Ref: 083
STARBALL.  Every once in a while along comes a PD game that makes you
think - WOW! - and I promise you this is one of them!  Pinball games
are not very easy to do and the PD versions available are far and few
between.  But pinball games of this calibre are VERY rare, indeed
this is the best pinball game I have ever played on an Atari,
commercial or otherwise.  The graphics are very very very good (I
want to stress that point!) as are the sound effects, whats more you
can choose your own soundtracker modules to play in the background
should you so desire.  There are four tables and plenty of bonus
screens including a Llamatron screen!  Very addictive playing and
very clever, register your copy now because I promise you are going
to love this one.  Balls of a different kind can be found in Parx's
MULTIBALL its like pong but with four players, lots of balls and
manic fun indeed!  Get two Atari power pads plugged in and four
people can go crazy around your Falcon as you bounce the balls into
each others areas.  Wild fun, superbly presented and GREAT music,
shame its RGB only.

Ref: 084
There are other things on this disk (mpeg animations) along with UFO
WAR a nifty little two player blast - em - up.  It runs in RGB
overscan and you pilot your little craft around trying desperatly to
destroy the other player - well best of luck to you because this is a
tricky little number!  Again flawless presentation and music.

Ref: 090
BLACK HOLE gee this is an odd game!  It works on a VGA or RGB in 256
colour mode and ... well to be quite honest I havn't a bloody clue
what you are supposed to do in it!  The help files are not very
helpful.  If there is one thing about this game it has to be the
sampled sound effects - quite amazing for sure, well worth ripping
out!  COLOUR CLASH is a brilliant little ST game from Animal Soft
that I have fixed to run on the Falcon.  Guide your chameleon across
the screen, zapping blocks, inflating yourself and exploding!!!  Its
great fun and a good puzzle game, well written and, well I love it,
so that is why its here!  POTHOLE 2 is a boulderdash clone of the
highest order, enough said really, if your idea of fun is rushing
around collecting diamonds avoiding falling rocks and baddies then
welcome to heaven!!!

              FALCON GRAPHICS APPLICATIONS AND UTILITIES
              ==========================================

   Remember to quote the disk REFerence number when ordering disks.

Ref: 012
PERSISTANCE OF VISION RAYTRACER.  It's big, it's bad and its going to
need a lot of hard disk space, patience and pure skill to get
anything even remotely nice looking from it.  But patience is a
virtue they say.  The whole package is ZIPped up to the hilt, there
is no unZIP program supplied (no room) and with 390K worth of doc
files to wade your way through can I wish you the best of luck and if
you do create any nice pictures then please send them to me so I can
boggle over them and wish I was as talented.  HD required.

Ref: 015
BITCAMRA is a Falcon Image Utility from SKWare One, it will enlarge,
reduce and reproportion mono, 4 colour, 16 colour, 256 colour and
true colour images very fast with good results.  Loads IMG, STTT IMG,
XIMG and XGA pictures.  Save is disabled!  So can only really be used
as a picture viewer unless you register with them.  DML APPLICATIONS
these include AUTOGIF, AUTOIFF, AUTORAW and AUTOTGA.  Simply drag the
picture onto the program or set it up as an APPlication and it will
display the picture of your choice.  IFF2XIMG convertor program.  IFF
HAM 8 picture viewer.  JPEG4A will convert from JPEG to GIF or from
GIF to JPEG, can accept command line input to do a whole series of
files in one go, very useful program.  PALETTE MASTER is a simple
palette checking program designed for the Crazy Dots expansion card
but works just as well on the Falcon.  SPEED OF LIGHT GIF Viewer 2.1
and 2.5 provided here, uses clever dithering processs to give the
effect of more colours than are actually on-screen.  GEMVIEW 2.24 the
best shareware image viewing package, plenty of features, register it
now (updated version elsewhere in this catalogue).  STUDIO PHOTO DEMO
load and play with all the picture types including Photo CD, TIFF,
GIF, JPEG and more, but sadly no save option.

Ref: 022
BABY SE FALCON 030 is an image loading, manipulation package that has
many of the features of Studio Photo, infact from decidely similar
French menu options I would say this is a very early version of
Studio Photo under a different name and with the save function
intact!  GEMVIEW 2.30 the best gets better, it now runs in True
Colour mode 100%, it comes with its own install program and a hard
drive is recommended.  PAPILLON 1.0 by Stefan Becker and Dirk
Sabiwalsky is a very detailed art package with a wide range of tools
and other effects options.  Allows exportation as IMG, Doodle, STAD,
MacPaint, IFF or PCX formats.  STUDIO PHOTO seems to make it onto
this disk as well for some reason, a sample JPEG is supplied and yes
the save function is still disabled!  TRUE PAINT is another demo of
an art package this time by HiSoft, again a sample JPEG is supplied
to play with.  A good try before you buy situation.

Ref: 083
Along with Multi Briques and Starball this disk also contains a demo
of Lexicors Phoenix 2 raytracing package.  Sadly you will need an FPU
in order to use even the demo so I can't comment on it, but from the
doc files I have read it looks very detailed indeed and should give
you all a great time if raytracing is your scene.

Ref: 092
GEMVIEW 3.00 the best is back and this time is has grown so much it
warrants a whole new upgrade!  There are external picture modules,
print modules, snapshot programs, configuration files, improved
colour reduction, faster conversion times, monochrome TIFF bug fix,
source code for new drivers included, zoom functions and much much
more.  This is the all time great of image viewing and conversion and
your collection shouldn't be without this program.

ST News Vol. 7 Issue 3.  This world famous disk magazine is Falcon
compatible and contains lots of interesting articles, stories,
features and reviews from all over the Atari community.

Ref: 024
BIGSCREEN shows you an amazing resolution on your RGB monitor!  BOUND
bounces this ball around the screen by CRAC.  COOLSONG is a groovin'
module tune.  DRAGON is a little Falcon demo.  ETERNITY is a little
Falcon demo to welcome new group to the scene.  FLIGHT is a trip into
a fractal, well its three trips actually.  FRACTALE is a program to
make your own fractals with the DSP if wanted.  GOURAUD is a little
vector demo to show off gouraud shading in real-time.  MAD is exactly
that!  MOUNTAIN will make fractal mountains and fly through them
albeit a little slowley even on 030!  MUDU is a module player that
runs in the background.  SWABS is a screen expander for RGB only. 
UTOPOS is an STE thrust style game that almost works on the Falcon.

Ref: 079
A real mixed bag here.  STELLO a good Othello game but too hard. 
JPEG4A convert from JPEG to GIF and vica versa.  ANCIENT ART OF ASCII
convert a PI3 into an ascii text file.  SNAPSHOT runs in any mode
saves screen as BTL file (display source included).  TEXT 2 PRG turns
a text file into a .PRG file with fast scrolling displayer built into
it.  TRIYAHOO is a wild Yahtzee game with manic samples and very
addictive if you like puzzle games.  BACKWARD 2.42 is new backward
version, why on this disk I don't know!

what you are missing!  The music styles range from rave to rock with
plenty of interesting samples thrown in.  All the disks listed are
high density and most contain module players.  I can only list the
name of the modules that are on the disk in such a short space, but
if you wish to request more information about a particular disk then
just write to me enclosing a first class stamp and I will do my best.

include the full module name, failing that the title of the file.

            =================================================
            NEW PD DISKS JUST IN AND NOT YET COMPILED TO DISK
            =================================================

You can still order these titles but please be aware that there may
not be much else on the disk with them.

Ref: NEW001
DBA Disk Magazine Issue 10.  This high density disk is filled with
lots and lots (hundreds!) of articles, programs, pictures, two superb
modules and a nice graphical user interface.  Very good.  The range
of articles include Jaguar, Falcon, Music, Films and demo reviews and
crew interviews.  A very demo-coders sort of disk-mag but good
anyway.  Falcon enhanced shell.

Ref: NEW002
The Mugwumps amazing Cycedelic Knockout demo.  Comes ZIPped onto
three high density disks, will need about 2.6 meg on hard drive and
full 4 meg of memory.  This is a trance brain blaster.  The music is
8 channel DSP replayed, the graphics are quite amazing.  This is a
sensational demonstration of the Falcon's graphics and sound like
nothing you have ever seen before.  Very 'rave' and trance inspired,
lots of spinning shapes and melting colours.  Very fast, very good
and you MUST get this demo!  RGB but will run on VGA if your monitor
can handle being pushed into 50hz frequency.

Ref: NEW003
DynaPlus is a BRILLIANT version of that age old classic game,
Dynablaster.  How many of you actually knew that the very original of
that whole genere started on the 8-bit Japanese computer called the
MSX with a game entitled Eric and the Floaters by Hudson Soft?  Well
its true!  Run around, bomb away, pick up power-ups, play up to 6
players (minimum 2) and have a riot.  Samples are EXCELLENT, graphics
are EXCELLENT.  In whole highly recommended indeed for some manic
fun.

Ref: NEW004
The Independant Music Compilation 1.  The 1 in the title kind of
suggests there may be more to come, boy I hope so!!!  There are 11
tunes giving you a total of over 52 mins worth of music, the
presentation is top quality, the tunes are top quality (my favourite
is FLY by Beatbox of Aura) and its VGA or RGB compatible.

Ref: NEW005
Tautology is the title of this detailed game of Shanghi on your
Falcon.  Nice enough graphics and sound, lots and lots of options and
you can even design your own tile sets!  Nice one from the Reservoir
Gods.  RGB only, VGA seems to freeze when you select play, I hear
this is to be fixed soon, lets hope so its a great game and very
addictive.

Ref: NEW006
Digital 2.4 is the latest version I have and it is now up to 24
stereo channels of digital sound!!!  This version seems to be easy to
crash but it can play lots of PC modules and is getting better all
the time.  24 channel?  I ask you!  There are three 8 channel PC
modules from the Crystal Dreams demo on the PC included.

Ref: NEW007
I have recently collected together the famous disk magazine - Maggie
- from issue 12 onwards it has been Falcon compatible (run in ST LOW)
and has had a strong Falcon theme so it seems sensible to give you
the chance of buying these brilliant electronic publications.  I have
issues 12, 13 and 14.  Chris say's (the editor) that issue 15 is due
out soon!  I hope so, its one damn fine magazine.

Remember to quote the disk REFerence number when ordering PD disks
from us.

Ref: 004
This disk contains 90 different cut 'n paste fonts stored in PC1
format.  They are all 16 colour and are the type used in demos
scrolling messages or title pages for computer games.  If you are a
programmer and you need some quick, top quality fonts, then I
strongly suggest checking out this disk.

Ref: 006
The best of ST graphics.  This disk is a collection of the best 16
colour ST graphics I could find, the subject range is diverse and
amazing from warships and helicopters to amazon women and devils. 
Some are taken from commercial games, some from demos, some from PD
programs and some are hand drawn.  There is bound to be something on
here of interest, especially if you are after graphics for a games
title page or something.  The Deluxe Paint IFF pictures on this disk

Ref: 036
TARGA Slideshow disk 1.  This disk includes the SLIDEMOD program by
Douglas Little, which will play a 50khz soundtrack module and display
Targa (TGA) True Colour pictures as a slide show on screen.  The
pictures on this disk are all of a raytraced theme and are of amazing
quality, they are the ones that magazines like ST Format use for
screen grabs!  The pictures are: S_BALLBO, S_BOWL, S_CAR, S_CHESS,
S_PALACE and S_ROOM.  You are supposed to get the following two disks
to complete the set.  Please note you will require a RGB display of
some kind.  All the pictures are packed (with ICE Packer) although
the slideshow can handle this a normal art package won't so you will
need to decompress them before using them.

Ref: 037
This is the second disk of the SLIDEMOD series, it contains the
instructions for the program and the soundtracker module plus another
8 pictures which are: B_FISH, F_TOMB, S_ARCHES, S_DESK, S_NTREAL,
S_OAK, S_PACMAN and S_PAWNS.

Ref: 038
This disk has nothing but Targa pictures (ice packed) to complete the
SLIDEMOD series.  The pictures are: A_LOGO2, C_CAM1, D_DRAG5,
E_PLANT, S_BENZ, S_CLUSTE, S_EIGHT, S_MANTEL and S_PLANET.

Ref: 039
Fancy a trip into Japanese culture and history?  Then the following
two disks are a must!  This disk contains JAPAN1.ZIP and JAPAN2.ZIP. 
You will need the following disk to complete the set if you wish to
see all the pictures but you can use the images alone if wished. 
They are all XGA format, a program called JAPAN.PRG is supplied which
will load them all into memory and display them (but you will need
14meg for this!) or you can view them induvidually using another
program.  The program is XGA SHOW, I have not tried but I would guess
this is certainly NOT going to work on a VGA monitor.  It is 100% RGB
though.

Ref: 040
This is the second disk in the Japan range, it contains JAPAN3.ZIP
and JAPAN4.ZIP.  ST Zip is NOT supplied.  You WILL need a hard drive
and RGB display to view these pictures.

Ref: 041
Another superb SLIDEMOD disk, it can be used with the others in the
range or on its own as the program, a modules and the docs are
included.  There are 6 pictures which are: ATOLL, AUTOMATE, BABY,
CHESS3, EAGLE and ROMAN.  They a mainly digitised.  You will need an
RGB display if you wish to use the SLIDEMOD.PRG.

Ref: 048
Superb GIF's disk.  There are only five pictures on this disk (plus
the Speed of Light viewer 2.5 program) but they are of a VERY high
quality indeed.  The pictures are: ALIENS, ALIENSEA, MQ-TV, VIVID3HI
and VIVID7.  The Aliens picture is of flying saucers over San
Francisco with a nice warning slogan!  Aliensea is an amazing picture
of a head in a cracked shell over the sea - very good.  MQ-TV is a
raytraced picture of a man sat in an empty room watching TV! 
Vivid3hi and Vivid7 are both the pictures seen so often on the
monitors in PC adverts in Computer Shopper!  They are amazing
raytraced logo's with incredabile depth you can zoom in and in on
them and still get an amazing resolution picture.

Ref: 088
Raytraced Dreams.  This disk contains 7 very high quality raytraced
JPEG format pictures.  The Brainstorm DSP JPEG viewer is supplied.
The pictures are: BALL, OCEAN, ORCA, PALIC2, PALICA, VBALL and WACKY.
 You will need some 3D glasses to get the best from PALIC2 which
contains lots of raytraced dragons around a lake all in 3D and it
really does work if you have some of those glasses!  BALL is a
standard wooden ball that has been split up into chunks, OCEAN and
ORCA feature raytraced dolphins and whales, quite amazing.  VBALL is
a clever raytraced image and WACKY is just that!  Easter Island style
heads, odd glass objects and more!

Ref: 089
Again the Brainstorm JPEG viewer is included but this time the
pictures are of a more cartoony theme.  They are: GIGER1, GW,
HARDWARE, JD, JD2, JD3 and NEMESIS.  The JD pictures are of that
famous lawman Judge Dredd.  The Nemesis picture is a painting of the
classic 2000AD character Nemesis the Warlock by Simon Bisley and it
is one of my favourite pictures of all time.  Hardware is a raytraced
picture of a few tools.  GW is a stunning raytraced picture of a
great white shark looking very mean indeed.  GIGER1 is a bizarre and
typical H.R. Giger drawing (ie very odd!).  This disk also contains
two GIF pictures which are LOGO and LYAP. LYAP is a beautiful Lyapov
fractal and is really nice, LOGO is the famous Deep Space Nine logo
from the hit TV series.

Ref: 098
MANGA MANIA DISK!  If you are a fan of the superb Japanese animation
and comics known as Anime and Manga then this disk is for you.  You
may have heard (or even seen) films like Akira, 3X3 Eyes or Bubblegum
Crisis.  Well here is some hot, high powered artwork to go with the
shows.  I have split the pictures up by show and the folders are
3X3_EYES, AKIRA, AN_STUFF, BGCRISIS and CPD.  In the 3X3_EYES folder
are the following pictures: 3X3EYES1, 3X3EYES2, 3X3EYES3, 3X3EYES4. 
They all feature the wonderful Pai and Yamako.  AKIRA contains:
AKIRA_1, AKIRA_2, AKIRA_3 AND AKIRA_4.  The pictures are the typical
action scenes from the film including laser battles and the
mysterious children.  AN_STUFF is a miscellanous collection of Anime
related images from a variety of sources, there are 24 pictures in
this folder and they are: ANGLCP, ANIME1, ANIME2, AS7G2, AS8G6,
AS9G02, AS9G03, AS9G06, AS9G08, ASEED2, CASTO1, DEUNAN, DRABALL,
ENZUERU1, GIRL2A, GOKUH, MENDO, MERMAID, NAU01A, NAUSICA2, ORANGE_2,
SHAMPOO, UY_CARD and YOTODEN.  They feature lots of things from Rumik
Worlds Mermaid Forest to Apple Seed and Dragon Ball Z.  The BGCRISIS
folder has 5 high-octane, bio-booster pictures of those beautilful
future warriors the Lovely Angels from the famous cyberpunk Bubble
Gum Crisis Anime.  The pictures are: BGC1, BGC2, BGC3, BGC4 and BGC5.
 Finally CPD has three pictures in it, I don't know what they are
from so I can't comment, sorry!

Ref: 099
SUPER MODEL JPEGS.  Wow this is a HOT disk!  There is nothing
pornographic or indeed even topless on this disk, but there are 21
pictures of women looking so lovely your monitor will have a melt
down and your CPU will over-drive itself.  Run these through your
Falcon and swab the sweat off afterwards, the pictures are: FENN,
LOOK_MOD, MEG1, MEG2, MEG3, MEG_R, SC90COVE, SC90JUN, SCHIFF10,
SCHIFF17, SFENN1, SFENN2, SHIFF11, SHIFF12, SHIFF18, SHIFF19, SIG1,
SIG2, SIG3, SIG4 and SIG5.  There is no viewer supplied.  The SIG
pictures are from Sports Illustrated.  The SC pictures are from
Swimwear Collection.  The Meg pictures are of that film star Meg
Ryan, the Fenn pictures are of the stunning Sheryiln Fenn and the
Schiff pictures are of, can you guess? yes Claudia Schiffer.

(SOUND)
           ================================================
           Sound Files and Programs for the Atari Falcon030
           ================================================

Remember to quote the disk REFerence when ordering disks from the PDL.

Ref: 011
This disk contains the superb program CRAZY SOUNDS which does a job
very similar to SAM (Systems Audio Manager) but I think its better. 
There are 51 samples provided (in HSN format), a convertor program,
the Crazysound program and a mini accessory version.  You should have
endless fun with this one assigning things like Bart Simpson saying
'Hi Man' when you boot-up!  DIGITAPE is a fully working demo of this
top flight direct-to-disk recording package from Trade-It.  It's big,
its detailed, there are lots of options, you are restricted to 20
seconds maximum recording time (plenty!) and there are other things
missing like the mixer saving and track copying.  A VGA monitor is
highly recommended but it will run on an RGB in interlace mode.  Also
on this disk is FADER which comes from Normen Kowalewski, a TOS
developer from Atari Germany.  It seems to achieve the same job as
Audio Fun Machine does with various options for playback quality,
etc.  Whats more is that the complete C source code is included. 
FORTUNE is a program to play and create sound cites on your Atari
Falcon like on big UNIX computers (taken straight from the doc file).
 Ok this is a similar sort of program to SAM and Crazy Sounds but its
public domain, uses the Unix system (which means many cites are
already available).  A sample CITE (a cite is a collection of samples
and text data) is included called FLAVOR and I have seen other PDL's
offering cites for purchase so if you find this useful you may like
to check them out, I think Star Trek are the most popular ones
though!  This program is recommended for VGA monitors but will work
with RGB in interlace.  There are two soundtracker modules players on
this disk and they are the PROPLAY.ACC from Cylab of TPN which lets
you listen to Protracker Amiga modules while doing other things. 
There is also the ProTracker v2.1a replayer by Griff of Electronic
Images which plays the modules at 50khz with 32 bit interpolation
which gives a much different kind of sound to the music, it also
decrunches Powerpacked modules from the Amiga!  Finally there are two
pieces of assembler source code for replaying modules.  The last
program on this very packed disk is XBAR.  Now all the docs are in
German and I must confess to being unable to understand a word of
them, but when you boot up Xbar is presents you with a screen that
lets you have DAC, DSP, DMA and EXT down the side and ADC, DSP, DMA
and EXT along the top and at a guess I think you can vary the source
of the sound and the way in which you want to replay it.  Its all
very confussing but the full C source code is here along with some
DSP effect modules and an ACC version.

Ref: 033
This disk includes files to be found in the UTILS section of this PD
catalogue, but it also has the following sound and music related
packages.  AUDIO CD PLAYER will do just that!  Take a music source
from your CD-ROM and play it through your speakers so you can listen
to your favourite compact discs through your Falcon.  AUDIO 12
appears to be a _very_ basic sampling program written by Martin
Sieper.  You can sample direct to memory or disk in either 8 bit
mono, 8 bit stereo or 16 bit stereo at one of 8 different frequencies
(from 8195 Hz to 49170 Hz).  You can also control the volume of the
input and output.  Nice but basic.  DMA-SOUND is a sound sample
player devloped for the STE, TT and Falcon computers.  Bascially it
allows you to play samples using the in-build hardware of the Falcon,
it seems to work well but doesn't have many frequencies so you may
find it limited.  Finally music related on this disk is HARDCHOR, no
its not the unfinished Jeff Minter game, but another direct to disk
recording package for the Falcon.  It seems to have come from TOS
Magazin, well whatever its all very German but nothing you shouldn't
be able to understand.  Three sample rates, three formats, set the
size of the sample, record to disk, playback from disk and 5 DSP
effects including Delay, Equalizer, Harmoniser, Flanger and Karaoke. 
Infact this seems to be a very early version of Compos Musicom, still
its PD, its free and it works.  This disk also contains Connect,
Colour Icons, CS and Chagall demo.

Ref: 055
Not essentially a sound related disk it does contain some interesting
programs (see the UTILS section for more details).  DIGITAL TRACKER
1.03 was the first tracker (and indeed still the only as far as I
know) to play more than the standard 4 channel Amiga modules. 
Digital can handle up to 8 channels in this version.  An ACCessory
version and two modules are provided.  DOC files are far and few
between so its a case of trial and error, and if you have never used
a module maker before, probably error.  TCB TRACKER is that age old
ST module maker converted to run on the Falcon, I don't know why you
could want to use it but should you have some old TCB modules (they
never did use the conventional format) then I guess this might be
useful to rip sounds from.  SPEKTRUM is a graphical spectrum analyser
on-screen, thats all it does!

Ref: 071
WAVEFORM FILES DISK 1.  Hit the beach, the surfs up as these cool
WAVe's roll into the short.  If you do not know what a WAVe file is
let me explain.. they originate from the PC Windows environment and
are basically sampled sounds much like the AVR or SAM ones we are
more used to hearing on the Atari.  You can use the WAV player like
the one that comes with Crazy Sounds (Ref: 011) or the 5-2-5
convertor program.  Whatever a player is not provided (no room) so
you will have to seek one out from somewhere.  The WAV's on this disk
include a lot of classic Blackadder quotes, the files are: BARKER,
CANIHELP, CHERRI, CORKIT, CRACKER, CRAP, DUCK, FATGIT, HUMBUG, JAMN,
OHDEAR, OMNIBUS, OOPS, PIGGY, PUDDINGS, RHINO, SPLAN, SQUEEK,
TANGRNE, THINGIT, TIDDLER and VISITN.  They are extremely funny!

Ref: 072
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 2.  Yet more, this time the theme is very
American TV humour (ie, not very funny!).  Files are: ANMALDRV,
BAMBI, BEATIFUL, DNGWOMAN, ERRECT, HIHOTIM, LESSTHAN, MACHO, NEEDMAN,
NOBEER, NOCONTRL, NOTCLOSE, SAUSAGE, SHAKBEER, VAVAVOOM and VISURGE.

Ref: 073
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 3.  Not many samples here because they are big
files and are mainly Japanese singing and music!  Hey, I am sure you
can find a use for theses somewhere!!!  Files are: 106MILES,
94DOLLAR, AHANHGAI, BESTPAL, GHOST, MISSION and WORST.  (Actually
GHOST is a really nice tune I wish I could have heard more).

Ref: 074
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 4.  25 samples on here from the Simpsons to
women talking to computery clicks and noises.  Files are: ASKDOCTR,
BART, BUM, COW, DEAD_OR, FORGET, HAPPYJOY, HAVEYOU, ICANHARD,
IDONTLIK, ITSBEEN, JOY, LOCTUS, LOG, LOGTUNE, MEGAMIX1, MEMORIES,
NOSIR, NUKEUM, ONLYADRE, ROBOCOP, TALKING, TELLME, WELCOME and
YOUWORM.  (Megamix1 is a complete compilation of most the samples on
this disk into one brain blasting 343K sample that sounds really very
good!).

Ref: 075
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 5.  Lots of little samples on here, 34 in total.
 Plenty of effects, voices and snippets to enhance that desktop! 
Files are: ENERGIZE, FAILED, FALLBONK, FASCINAT, FEELGOOD, FIRE!,
FOLLOWME, FROG, FSIGH, FUNK, GOODMORN, HARP, HASSAN, HOWYA,
ILLBEBACK, JOINME, KANSAS, NIGHT, NOFILE, NOHELP, OUT, PHONE, PHONE2,
PHOTON, POP, R2BEEP, ROBBY, ROBOCOP, SORT, STTNG, WHOP, WOWO, YERDEAD
and YES_MAST.  (This disk is ideal for SAM or CITE files).

Ref: 076
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 6.  Another alsortment of wierd and wonderful
WAV's.  27 samples mainly sound effects this time.  Files are:
CLAPPING, DIVEHORN, DOORBELL, DRUM1, HORN1, MPYTHON, MUSIC, MUSICA,
OLDCLOCK, PENAL, PERMIS, PHONE2, PHONRING, PITFOR, POWERL, PROTOPLM,
PROVERB, PURPOS, SHIPHORN, SHORT, SPAM, SPEED, SW1USEF, WHALES,
WHISTLE, YIPE and ZIP.

Ref: 077
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 7.  I am not sure about the legalities of these
samples as they are mainly taken from Street Fighter 2 and other SNES
games, still until someone complains they can't do much harm I hope. 
Files are: BLANKA, END, HADOKEN, HORYUKEN, KNIFE, LIGHT, MF-THINK,
MIND, MYMYDY, NOPROB, OH, OHJOY, SONICBM, STARFOX, START, TGRUPCUT,
YADA, YOGAFIRE and YOGAFLM.  (If you are thinking of making a beat em
up game then this is a disk to get!).

Ref: 078
WAVEFORMS FILES DISK 8.  My last disk of WAV's for now and I leave
you with no less than 49 samples on this disk.  Everything from Star
Trek to sound effects to cartoon snippets.  A great collection.  The
files are: 10000MAR, 1CARTOON, 20SECOND, AHHHHH, ALIENLF, BOING,
BRIDGE4, BRIDGE5, BRIDGE6, BRIDGE7, BUMMER, BUMTOO, CHICKEN, CHILL1,
CHILL2, CHIMES, CHORD, CLARIC, CORRECT1, CORRECT2, DICKWAD, DING,
DROOPY, DRUM, ERROR, FLAGUP, GDDY2DIE, GOODMO, GOODMO1, GRAVIT, HAND,
HARDER, HIHAL, HIMAN, HITME, ISWEAR, JUMP, KLAXON1, KLAXON2,
LOOPME01, LOOPME02, MEEPMEEP, NOWHERES, NYUKNYUK, PLAYME01, POP,
THANKYOU, VAULT and WELCOME.  (A great collection if ever there was
one!).

Ref: 085
As well as an EKO demo, Graph Prg and a picture this disk also
contains: DIGITAL 2.02 this is the newest version of the 4,6 and 8
channel soundtracker player and composer.  It is getting better all
the time and you really should register this version if you intend
using it for making your own tunes.  It will play the PC formats and
is expanding all the time.

Ref: 101
Along with the new version of the hit-game Lasers and Men this disk
contains the TriMod creator which will allow you to make chip music
on your Falcon for playback on the ST or Falcon (run in ST LOW).  I
have also included the superb MegaTizer Music Collection and the ZAK
player so you can listen to all those wonderful old ST chip tunes all
over again, and some of them really are quite good even today.  Could
be useful for someone wanting some music but for a small size
program.

                PD and SHAREWARE FALCON UTILITIES
                =================================

Remember to quote the disk REFerence number when ordering.

Ref: 016
BACKWARD v1.43 is an ST Emulator that lets you select various modes
such as Hard Disk, Timer A or DMA sound, 1 meg memory, 16 or 8mhz
chip, BLiTTER on or off and much more.  It will allow a lot of ST
only games and programs to run on your Falcon and is an essential
utility.  BOOTCONF lets you configure your machine when you boot-up
its very basic and doesn't let you change much only things like Cache
and speaker on\off.  DCSEA 2.0 from Double Click software is a superb
multi-archiver that supports ARC, LZH, ZIP and ZOO formats.  It
creates an executable program that when double-clicked will auto
matically depack the files onto your disk.  DESKPIC will let you load
a GIF file into the background of your desktop (and it can slow
things down a little too!) its quite fun and well written but I often
find it annoying waiting for the picture to be loaded up although
once installed the speed difference is not that noticeable.  FBOOT is
a small util from Sinister Developments that lets you toggle the
cache, speaker, autoboot a disk and bypass hard drive.  It does this
by installing a boot-sector to a floppy disk.  FPATCH1 fixes two
little problems in the Falcon BIOS (TOS 4.00 - 4.04) where the sound
is not initialized properly and the Bconmap doesn't work.  FALCON
SCREEN is a little program that claims to get more from your monitor
resolution wise, from what other people have said it does this very
well but I am yet to use it.  GEMBENCH performs simple benchmark
tests on your computer and compares them with other Atari machines. 
MAGIBOOT is another attempt at an ST Emulator to make those games
work on the 030.  MULTI DIAL is a MultiTOS program (German) to make
those dials fly out all over the place.  MEGA DEPACKER v2.0 is a very
popular depacking program that will recognise most types of ST and
Falcon packer including Automation, Pompey, Ice, Jam and many more. 
A very useful little program indeed.  MTOS_ACC 1.0 by Oliver Scheel
lets you select accessoies with the Control key.  PRIORITY! is
another MultiTOS program that checks which program requires the most
processor time and frees it up for it so it can run faster.  PROCLIST
is a MultiTOS program that displays a list of the processes currently
running.  SPEAKER OFF is a little program to put in your AUTO folder
to turn the internal speaker off upon boot-up.  TTGAMES is another ST
emulator is says to fix some games to work on the Falcon.

COPY is a little disk copier and formatter that uses an extended
format as standard allowing 1.6meg on a HD disk.  FLI PLAY will play
those 256 colour PC animations in full glory on your Falcon.  See the
demo section for plenty of example FLI files to amaze yourself with. 
HDPATCH is a fix for AHDI.  ICE PACK is version 2.4 and is very
Falcon friendly, get it into action should you wish to pack your
files down and save disk space.  LHARC is the popular method used by
bulletin boards for compressing their files and you will need this to
unpack them all.  MAGIC SHADOW ARCHIVER 2.32 is a special little
program that will pack an entire disk into one single file and vica
versa.  DESKCOPY UTILITIES by Roland Schorr, these MultiTOS utils
include FMT a replacement background disk formatter and diskcopy
utility, NEWCOPY a replace copy, move, rename and trash program. 
TRASHDEL clears the trashcan directory completely (no return!). 
NVRAM CPX will reset the non-volatile memory of your Falcon should
something nasty go wrong with your system.  OUTSIDE DEMO is a virtual
memory program that will enable you up to 52 meg extra memory in this
cut-down demo version.  OVERSCAN will kick your monitor into overscan
mode (RGB only) useful for expanding that desktop.  SENTRY PACKER
2.05 is another file packer with advanced options for pictures and
samples and depack source code for the ICE format.  VRAM is a German
program that claims to be a 'Virtueller Speicher Manager' I am sorry
I don't know what it does, its version 2.57 and I feel it is some
kind of virtual memory manager.  Finally on this disk is ST ZIP 2.3
that famous file packer and depacker, essential, get it now!

Ref: 043
525 is a sample convertor that can handle DVSM, AVR, SND, AU, WAV and
RAW data samples.  BURP! is a little GEM hack that makes your screen
bounce up and down no matter what you are doing (ie playing a game or
drawing a picture), quite sickening!  CHKDISK3 is a utility that
analyzes a disk's file structure and does all necessary fixes but
take a back-up of important data first.  DIVINE is a demo version of
a new art package that looks like Neochrome on the Falcon.  DSP
PLAYER is a modules player that uses the DSP instead of the 68030. 
It works well and runs as a TTP.  EDISON is a multi-function
ACCessory that speeds up your mouse, configures key cliks and such
and also has a screen saver built in that works in all Falcon
resolutions.  FALCON SCREEN 5 the latest version of this screen
enhancer, use at your own risk.  LAMEMINE is a version of the Windows
classic but bigger and better!  MARIO is a funny little affair where
you control what looks like a womble in a go-cart around this very
SNES Mode 7 type course, no time limit, plenty of other drivers, no
collision, looks fun!  MINI LEDGER v3.3 is a powerful new
computerized financial accountant.  Having done accounts for a year
and learning double entry, VAT, Factory accouts, etc.. I can vouch
for the quality of this program.  You have a 15 record limit on this
version.  ML-PLAY V0.02 is a straight-thru sample player (ie plug a
sound source into your microphone socket) and the results come out as
your work on the desktop.  PLASMA1 is a new version of the classic
BSS plasma demo (rgb only).  PLAYMAN is a little ACCEssory that lets
you play modules from the desktop.  MODUL-PLAYER v3.42 is a nice
production from Channel-38 that plays modules at a good quality with
a nice demo-screen style playback screen.  PROTRACKER is the complete
module editing, creation, playback suite and comes with two sample
modules provided.  Its a very good program, is RGB and VGA and plays
all known modules types from the Amiga.  PRO PLAYER is yet another
module player ACCessory, try them all and take your pick of the best
one you want!  QAD 3D VGA is a little demo by Percy of Light that
lets you control a massive shaded vector on-screen, it is a spinning
top shape so you can spin it and watch the colours rotate!  nice, VGA
only.  SLIDEMOD is the TGA slideshow program used to great effect in
our raytraced demos in the graphics section of this PDL.  SPERM is a
starfield with a novel twist to it!  SPIRIT EDITOR 1.3 is a desktop
ACCessory text editor.  Finally are some technical documents about

BACKWARD 2.24 the famous ST Emulator expands even further, pretty
much the same options but a better interface and you can save special
configuration files for disks you use a lot.  BMAPFIX 2.0 by Don
Maple fixes an error in the serial ports of your Falcon.  CLOCK 2.0
is a desktop ACCessory that runs in a borderless window and displays
the time using a standard clock face, it can handle analog, analog
with digital date or a whole variation on those themes.  ECOPY 1.5 is
a very impressive disk copying utility that can handle most format
types and has a very friendly interface and front-end (VGA
recommended).  It's very German but shouldn't be too hard to get
along with for the seasoned FCopy user in the past.  There are also a
multitude of special utils that come with Ecopy including Icons,
CPX's, Cookies and more.  F CONTROL 1.0 is another Falcon
configuration program that lets you toggle bell, key click, speaker,
hard drive, blitter and cache.  German.  MASTER BROWSE 3.2 is an
impressive text displaying program with facilities for multiple
documents open in windows, block cut and paste and extensive GDOS,
Neodesk, Terradesk, Gemini and MultiTOS support.  REZ FOOLER 1.2 is a
program that will try and fool your Falcon into thinking it has a
different type of monitor hanging off its ports than the one it
really does have, should enable some RGB-VGA programs to work on your
machine.  SWITCH is a little program that will switch your IDE drive
on or off.  XMENU is a superb little util that lets you make a menu
for your hard drive and run programs from it instead of from the
desktop, saves time if they are all over the place.

Ref: 059
BACKWARD 2.41 this ST Emulator gets updated with an amazing
regularity and seeing as its a very important program that all Falcon
owners should have I think you ought to get this upgrade now before
they update it again!  CLOE is a demo of a raytracing package, choose
some objects, sit back and wait... and wait... and wait!  CPX's there
are 14 new CPX modules for the XControl Panel, they are BIORYTHM'S,
BOOTREG, CALLFSEL, DRUCKER, D_FREE, HD_FREE, HORPUZZ, MASTERMIND,
MONOLUPE, PUZZLE, SCOOK211, SOLITARE, SPOOLCPX and TELEINX.  More d2d
programs surface with DAME the newest of the bunch, dame is a Digital
Audio Multilayering & Editing program.  You load it, you look at the
screen display, you think 'YIKES!' what on earth?!  It's big and
nasty and if someone would like to write a tutorial for it I would be
happy.  VGA recommended.  JML SNAP 3.10 as far as I can tell
(extensive docs - in German) is a snapshot program that saves out as
IFF, (X)IMG and TIFF.  BRAINSTORM FLI\FLC MOVIE PLAYER is a desktop
animation player, it runs under Gem, TOS and MultiTOS, will run in
any resolution, is AES colour friendly (no screwy desktop after
running an animation) and movies can be re-sized as they play so you
could have an animation running in the background of your desktop! 
It runs as an ACCessory and I didn't have too much luck with it, it
never seemed to like the FLI files I game it to play, however others
swear by it.  Trial and error I guess.  PIXART is a demo version of
the new art program for the Falcon, its a very clip-arty type program
but it has some very interesting effects such as scrunch, ball wrap
and more.  Lots of file formats supported.  Good demo to see if the
original from ST Club is worth buying!  REST PAL is a little util
that will re-set the Falcon palette after a nasty little program has
mucked it all up (only about 50% success though, maybe I am running
it wrong?).  XGA - SPECTRUM 512 a nice picture convertor, turn a 512
picture into an XGA picture, shame it doesn't work in reverse.

                             =======

We want YOUR programs to include in our growing library of PD disks.
We will swap programs on a one for one ratio, we don't mind if they
are you own or if you have copied them from somewhere else, if it is
Falcon related then please send it to us for exchange.

If possible it would be helpful if you could send us details of the
programs (perhaps by email) before sending disks to make sure we
don't swap any titles we both already have.

So look through our catalogue and choose some disks in exchange for
any programs you have that we don't.  We want them all.  But they
MUST be Falcon specific, not just ST programs that happen to work on
the Falcon.  Anything from Calamus fonts to new games.

If you have written a program yourself then send it to us and we will
exchange it for TWO disks of your choice, if it is of a really high
quality we will send you even more disks free and if its REALLY good
we will pay you for it (especially if you manage to squeeze our
address into the program somewhere!).

I am always on the look out for the latest programs, pictures,
modules, samples, utilities and more.  If you would like to start
swapping then send me your list today.
