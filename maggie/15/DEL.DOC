     Well, I must be getting something right at last .. I have been 
asked by the famous Felice of the Maggie Team to contribute yet 
another selection of anecdotes which stem from my days of running a
family owned Computer and Games shop here in Blackpool.

     But before I do, I must tell you of a very strange thing which
happened to me only recently. I had been reading through a stack of
magazines published for the owners of various computers (yes, they
were for the PC and the Amiga!), when suddenly I became most alarmed by
the headlines of these which boldly shouted, 'ALAS, THE ST IS NO MORE!' 
and the sub-headlines which cried out 'THE ST IS DEAD!!'. Not only
this, but people kept ringing me up and saying such things as 'Well, I
give up .. the ST has died at last!'.

     Suddenly, panic hit me .. what about MY computers, MY STFM and the
STE? I rushed into my little computer room and with shaking fingers
plugged both machines into the electric sockets. Trembling, I switched
on both machines. I closed my eyes as I dare not look ...!

     With bated breath I carefully pushed a disk into the STE, and then
into the STFM. To my great relief, I heard the disk-drives whirring
away and it was but a few seconds later that pictures came up on  my
monitors. IT WASN'T TRUE .. NOT ALL ST's HAVE DIED ...! CERTAINLY NOT
MINE ...! And for as long as the various Atari STFM's and STE's owned by
myself and other members of my family live on, the ST cannot die and so 
never will!! Like so many others folk we have thousands of most excellent
programs for both the STFM's and the STE's and I'm damned if I am about
to give up my machines just because some flaming idiots keep on telling
me that they are dead !!

     Well, with that off my mind, I will continue with the article which
Felice wanted from me .. namely one about the damned funny things which
people say and do when they are in a retail shop .. and if you recognise
yourself .... hard luck!

€     First, let's start with some of the letters which I received over
the years, for believe me, 'schoolboy' howlers are committed more often
by 'responsible' adults than they ever are by those still receiving 
education in class.

     The first letter was from an overseas European country which I shall
not name as I have some very good Atari ST friends over there .....

     'I am looking for help of hand with word of English. I am rotten. In
English I am going very bad. My word is bad and going off. If I am going
no better I will push it for France. I do not want to push it for France.
I want push France for England. Do you have teaching disk for one so
rotten? I will have two if you have more one.'

     And another from over the water .....

     'I study Bible. I have PD disk without New. I think New most
important for pages. I have One book of Bible but not Two. I want New
one not Old one. I have got Old one. Do you have New on one side
disk with all others from New one of 512k? Tell me how cost New one
and others from New book and I will send it but only single disk and
512k or I can not read of John and his brothers and others who walk
around in a group.'

     I am pleased to say that I could supply both of these gentlemen with
the disks they were looking for (at least I hope I did!).

     And now a few telephone enquiries I received from customers ...... 
                   ~~~~~~~~~
     'Have you got a PD disk about breeding rabbits? I asked my mother
and father if I could have a book about breeding rabbits but I am only
eleven and my mother said that I shouldn't be thinking about these things
just yet.'

     'Can you tell me the best way to get chewing gum out of your disk
drive?'  (Just how the hell did it get in there??)

     'I am sorry I couldn't keep my promise to ring you about buying a
new STE two weeks ago but I had not realised that they were going to cut
off our phone as I just can't remember getting the red notice.'

     'I don't know if you can help me but I only have one arm and find
it difficult to use the mouse and the keyboard at the same time.'

     'I'm sure that you will remember me, I am the chap who fell
through your window last September......'  (He was thanking me for my
help at the time of his accident .. and YES, I DID remember him!)
     He went on to say, 'I am doing very well now ... they finally got
all the splinters of glass out but I still can't shake my head yet.'

     Another man who rang me to say thanks for helping him at the time
of his accident was one who had slipped on a very frosty and snow-
covered footpath close to my shop. He said, '... I am improving slowly
but I still can't get my hands above my head and its the same with my
€right leg.'

     This telephone call was from  a young man who had somehow lost 
his 'expensive' watch somewhere in my locality while out shopping ...

     ' ..... you can't fail to recognise it, it has a black strap and was
given to me by my father last Christmas. Also its fingers are stuck at
about five past one ... but the second finger's still working.'

     Not all the funny remarks I overheard in the shop were connected
with computers or games, but they certainly brought a smile to my face.
Here are a few extracts from conversations between boys or men ......

     'You see that lad who just went out of the shop?'
     'Yeah?'
     'Well his dad was fatally injured in a car smash last month.'
     'How is he now?'

     'Did you see that man who was standing at the counter just then?'
     'Not really .. why?'
     'The top of his head was covered in lumps .. wonder why?'
     'Perhaps he had tried to hang himself with his braces ..'

     'When did YOU last have sex then?'
     'Nineteen fifty nine.'
     'Bloody hell mate!'
     'Its not so bad really ... its only quarter past eight now!'

     'So I said to this girl, 'You look like my second wife.'
     'What did she say?'
     'She said, 'How many times have you been married then?', and I said,
     'Only once.'

     'This girl looked really fab! She had those skin-tight pants on and
      I said to her, 'How do you get into those?'. She looked straight
      at me and said. 'Well, you can start with a gin and tonic!'
     'How did you get on with her?'
     'I didn't .. I only had two pounds thirty on me to last all night!'

     'Where did you get to last Saturday night?'
     'I went to that new disco on the sea-front.'
     'Was it any good?'
     'Well, let's put it this way .. I've seen more life in a tramp's
      vest ... and the women!'
     'Were they not so hot?'
     'They looked like the cast from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller'!'

     'Anyway, we were dancing round her handbag and she said, 'I'm only
      here for the weekend', and so I said, 'Well I'm dancing as fast as
      I can!'

     'I said to her, 'Do you like Spaghetti Bolognaise?', and the silly
      cow said, 'Only when Pavarotti sings it.'

€     'So she said,'Would you like to be a Jehova's Witness?'. I said, 'I
      didn't even know there had been an accident!'

     'Do you come to Blackpool every year for your holidays?'
     'No .. I went to Spain last year.'
     'Did you like it there?'
     'Not really .. it was full of foreigners!'

     'I hadn't flown before and I was terrified. The chap in the next
      seat wasn't much help either. I said to him, 'How often do these
      planes crash?'. He said, 'Only once!'

     'How was your blind date then?'
     'Bloody awful .. everyone has the right to be ugly, but she
      abused the privilege! And thin .. I've seen more meat on a
      butcher's apron!'

     'Him.  thick ..? If he didn't have a hole in his trouser pocket he
      couldn't count up to eleven!'

     'How did you go on at the doctor's then?'
     'It was a bit embarassing really ... he said he needed a sample of
      my excreta and urine.'
     'What did you do .. give him your underpants?'

     'I warned him I was a black belt in judo.'
     'I bet that scared him off!'
     'Not really .. he hit me right between the eyes and I couldn't see
      properly for ten minutes ...'

     'I went into that little cafe again this morning. I said to the
      man behind the counter, 'I want a blackened fried egg, two pieces
      of shrivelled bacon, two burnt fried tomatoes, two slices of black
      toast, and a cup of coffee in a greasy cup please'. He said, 'I
      can't give you a breakfast like that!'. I said, 'Why not .. you did
      yesterday!'

     'I went for a job yesterday.'
     'What did they offer you?'
     'Collecting street litter .. but I told them I knew nothing about
      that.'
     'What did they say?'
     'The chap said, 'Don't worry .. you'll pick it up as you go along!'

     'They told me that I had to work a week in hand. I said, 'How do you
      mean?'. The man said, 'Well, you start work on Monday and you get
      paid a week on Friday.' I said, 'In that case I'll start a week on
      Monday!'

     'That guy who runs the new fish and chip shop at the corner of our
      street is weird!'
     'Why do you say that?'
     'Well I went in there with my girlfriend last night and said, 'Fish
      and chips twice'. He said, 'I heard you the first time!'
€
     'I can't believe the name my next door neighbours have given to
      their new baby boy.'
     'What's wrong with it?'
     'Well they are called Mr. and Mrs. Janus, and they've called their
      new baby 'Hugh'!'

     'Hi! Where's Joe?'
     'He was taken into hospital yesterday.'
     'How come?'
     'We were seeing who could ride the fastest towards a wooden fence
      before putting the breaks on ... he won ..'

     'You know that massive guy at the disco who calls himself Jake?'
     'Yeah?'
     'Well he was getting very shirty with me on Saturday night ..
      anyway I stood as much as I could and I said to him, 'Listen
      mate .. if you fancy your bloody chances I'll meet you at the
      back in five minutes..'
     'And did he go?'
     'I've no idea .. I p____d off out of the front fast!'

     'Don't try that little cafe that has just opened near the park.'
     'Why, is it rubbish?'
     'Well I'll put it this way .. its called 'John an' Stella' but I
      think a better name would be 'Sam an' Ella'.  (A clever one that!)

     'So this copper pulled me up in my car .. he said, 'Are you the
      driver of this vehicle?'. I said, 'Well actually, it's automatic
      but I do have to do a bit of work myself!'

     'The copper said, 'Do you know that your off-side rear light's not
      working?'. I said, 'Oh, that's no problem'. I got out of the car,
      walked round the back, gave the light a kick, and it came on. The
      copper said, 'That's very clever sir, .. now give your windscreen
      a good kick and see if you can make a Tax Disc come up!'

     'Some of these policemen are very arrogant though. A copper on a
      motorbike pulled me over the other day in my car. He said, 'Hello
      Wing Commander .. having trouble taking off?'. He said, 'Do you
      know that you were doing 90 miles an hour?'. I said, 'I couldn't
      have been .. I've only been out of the house ten minutes!'

     'I can always tell when my sister's been using my ST and my word-
      processor.'
     'How can you tell?'
     'There's 'Tippex' all over the monitor screen!'

     One of my regular teenage customers came into the shop one day and
handed me the following notice which he asked if I could place on my
advertising board.

     'Lost. Black and brown small cross-bred dog. Only has one eye and
      has part of its right ear torn away. Tip of its rear right leg
€      missing and has no front left paw. Tail bent and several front
      teeth are broken. Answers to the name of Lucky'

      (I didn't fall for that one!)

     I used to have a large board up on the wall of the shop on which
customers could place a card advertising their surplus computing items,
or anything for sale to do with computers and accessories. Some of the
notes which went up on that board were well hilarious .. in fact folks
would come into the shop just to read them .. here are a few samples:

     Well, that's enough for this issue of 'Maggie' of but a few
of the wise-cracks, letters, and funny 'phone calls which I used to 
across in my old shop here in Blackpool, but I still have space to tell
of some of the funnier requests that I received over my counter through
the years I was in there. For instance ...

     'Do you have a program on the German language .. I'm going to
      Belgium soon.'

     'How can you get motor oil off computer keys?'

     'My husband wants 'Terminating' ..'

     'Have you got a 'Teenage Queen' for a five and a quarter inch ..?'

     'I want an easy adventure game .. I got 'Robin Hood' last time and
      I couldn't even find my way through the bloody forest!'

     'Can I exchange this game, it's too hard .. they must think we are
      all Albert Einstein's and I'm more of your appentice dick-head!'

     'This football game's well hard .. the best I have done is to get
      beaten 11 - 1 by Italy .. and that was an own goal!'

     'Can I swap this 'Scrabble' game before I kill my kid brother?
      He keeps cheating by swearing that his words are real words. I
      mean, have YOU ever heard of the word 'bummpratt'?'

     'That art package I bought from you does sod all unless I do all
      the work first!'

     Lady customer ..'Can I exchange this spreadsheet program? I honestly
     thought it was to do with dieting.'

     Another lady customer .. 'Will you buy the ST back from me? I've had
     it for three months now and I think I would have been better of with
     a typewriter really as it seems to have mind of its own .. I
     certainly can't control it!'

     'If I take my STE on holiday with me will it run off a caravan
      battery?'

     'Can this ST be repaired? They don't take a lot of hammering do
€      they?'

     'Have you anything which will help me? As you can see, I only have
      two fingers on my right hand and I find it awkward typing.'

     'I was going to buy a modem but I believe you can't use them
      without a telephone .. is that right?'

     'I only have a single-sided disk drive on my ST .. is there any
      way you can turn disks over so the computer can write on both
      sides?'

     'Yes, I know you say the STE has 4,096 colours .. but can you
      prove it?'

     'Have you got a 'cheat' for International Soccer .. I just can't
      beat my kid brother ..'

     'Do you have something on 'Do it Yourself' for my husband .. only
      he's tried to put it up several times but it keeps falling off..'

     'I've come to buy another game, but I don't want one of those
      athletic running track games ... they knock all shades of s__t
      out of your 'O' and 'P'!'

     'I think my lad must hold the record for knackering-up joysticks ..
      he's gone through four in three weeks! And the shops are so 
      awkward when you take them back ..  Do YOU sell one that's maniac
      proof?'

     'I told my lad .. if you keep waddling it from left to right so
      bloody fast one of these days it'll come off in your hand!'

     Small boy - 'I asked my mum if I could have a joystick for my
     Spectrum but she said it's using too much electricity as it is ..'

     'I've searched high and low .. do YOU have anything that will
      teach you how to repair a Ford Cortina?'

     'I bought this roll of 1000 labels off you last Saturday.'
     'Yes?'
     'Check it yourself .. there are only 996.'

     'This Virus Killer I bought from you ..'
     'Yes?'
     'Well .. when you kill a virus, how do you know it's really dead?
      I mean it might only be stunned or something..'

     Same man .. '.. and when you have killed all the viruses, what
     happens to them .. I mean, where are the dead ones put?'

     'I've brought this 'Moon Walker' game back ... it has nowhere near
      as much music in it as the film had.'

€     Well, that's about it for this issue of 'Maggie'. Before signing
off, however, I must send greetings to Chris (Editor) and Felice (Asst.
Editor) of 'Maggie', and indeed to all members and contributors to the
magazine. Also, I would like to say 'Hi!' to Richard Karsmakers (he of
virus detecting and killing fame!), editor of the very popular 'ST
NEWS' magazine (keep it rolling Richard .. glad to hear you enjoyed my
little effort in 'Maggie 13').

     And to all you other ST, STFM, and STE fans out there ('the ST is
dead' indeed! .. Not to us it isn't!), I send all best wishes.

     Hope to see or hear from you all soon  ..
