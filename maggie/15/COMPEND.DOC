                         THE ATARI COMPENDIUM

Reviewed by Leon O'Reilly

If  Atari  reference  books  were  judged  by  size,  then  the  Atari
compendium would lead the world.  Unfortunately,  it  is down to me to
provide a slightly more in depth analysis, but let me again stress the
point that this is a  BIG  book.  Very  big.  I  will try to review it
without resorting to such cliches as calling it a 'bible' (as everyone
else seems to).

The back cover blurb informs us that the compendium has now become the
'de facto programmers  reference  for  Atari  computers'. Whilst other
books may plaster themselves  with  plaudits from national newspapers,
compendium has a comment from a  review  in Atari Explorer Online! And
yes, the reviewer (wiz utility  coder  Damien  M. Jones) calls it 'The
Atari Bible'.

The book opens with  self  congratulatory  forward  from Scott Sanders
before introducing to all the  different atari models (anyone remember
the 260ST?), GEM,  third  party  system  software  (which only details
Geneva) and programming  languages.  The  book  gives  examples of all
functions in C and assembly  language  and  politely mocks those using
other high level languages.

Like most books of this genre,  the  compendium splits up the o/s into
its separate components and has  a  chapter  on  each, and first up is
that old warhorse 'GEMDOS'. The  introduction covers the normal facets
of gemdos - the file system, memory managements, executing files - and
also MiNT, the extension to GEMDOS that allows multitask. To be honest
I, like most programmers, know  very  little  about  this, and want to
keep it that way.

All the functions are listed in alphabetical order, which will come as
a bit of a surprise to those  familiar with other reference books that
list functions numerically, but it turns  out  that this is actually a
€more convenient way of structuring  them  as similar functions usually
start with the same letter (FOPEN, FREAD, FSEEK, FCLOSE etc.).
The function number is also  given  in  both  hex and decimal which is
handy as some books only give you it in one format.
Also, all the MiNT calls are  listed  - no other reference books cover
these. The description for  each  call  is  more detailed and accurate
than any most books.

The BIOS chapter is, as always, very small. It covers some interesting
and often overlooked areas - the system bootup sequence, the operating
system header and the cookie jar. And of course, all 12 bios functions
are covered, and no they haven't changed since day 0 of the ST.

Like a thriller reaching  a  climax  or  a  whodunnit's last page, the
XBIOS section is always  the  highlight  of  reference  books, and the
compendium doesn't disappoint. We have  a  discussion of the new video
systems of the TT and Falcon, the Falcon's sound system and the DSP.
These topics are extremely complex  and  deserve  a  book in their own
right, a sketchy couple  of  pages  only  scratches the surface. Still
there are XBIOS functions that allow you  to do most things with these
pieces of hardware, and they are  well  documented in the remainder of
this chapter. Particularly  useful  are  the  new  calls  for the DSP,
setting screen resolution and sound replay.

Chapter 5 attempts a look 'into' the hardware, covering "those aspects
of Atari  software  programming  that  can  only  be  accomplished  by
accessing hardware registers directly." Running  to a flimsy 27 sides,
this can't really cover all  we  need  to  know,  but  it makes a fair
effort. Subjects like the  data  and  instruction  caches of the 68030
need more than 3 lines.  The  keyboard  information  is useful but has
been well covered by previous books,  it  does  focus on the new style
game  controllers  -  light  guns,  paddles  and  Power  Pads  (jaguar
controllers). Screen layout  and  fine  scrolling  are  discussed, but
there are an array  of  registers  on  the  Falcon's  video chip which
aren't mentioned.

Chapters 6 & 7 allow this book to live up to its name - they cover the
€AES and  VDI,  the  highest  levels  of  the  operating  system. Other
reference books tend to only cover GEMDOS/XBIOS  & the BIOS so this is
a welcome addition for all GEM  programmers.  All versions of GDOS are
covered including SPEEDOGDOS and the  88  pages of AES information and
168 pages of VDI/GDOS info give you a sound grounding in GEM.

Line A graphics functions are covered  in  chapter 8 even though Atari
recommends you don't use them as future machines may not support them.
They are also slow and crap  and  anyone  who uses them deserves to be
shot.

'Chapter' 8 has the words  'filler'  written  all  over it. Like a bad
screen in a demo it  sits  uncomfortably between the other heavyweight
chapters. Running to a grand total of  1  and a half pages (count 'em)
it tells you all about running programs and desktop files. Essential.

How much more can you write about? Loads, if you are Scott Sanders and
next up we have a chapter on  XCONTROL - the Extensible control panel,
an desk accessory which allows the loading  of other accs - whilst the
final chapter cover GEM user interface  guidelines which is a plea for
conformity amongst GEM programs. It will never work lads.

Appendix A gives us GEMDOS,  BIOS,  XBIOS,  AES & VDI functions listed
numerically  which  is  handy  for  those  confused  by  the  previous
alphabetical listing.

Appendix B is an extensive  memory  map  covering  all the vectors and
hardware addresses on all  machines.  This  looks  very similar to Dan
Hollis's excellent listing, and information about each address is kept
to a bare minimum.

Appendix C covers file  formats  such  as  .GEM,  .IMG,  .FNT and .RSC
whilst GEMDOS and BIOS error codes are detailed in Appendix D. We then
have the obligatory ASCII  and  Scan  code  tables  (Why  do scan code
tables always miss out the '#~' key -  am  I the only one who has this
on their keyboard?)

€The book is wrapped up with  a  SPEEDO  character map, a discussion of
the  drag  and  drop  protocol  (used  for  transferring  data  within
MultiTos) and extensive bibliography  and  a  poor  index. To be fair,
this index is lot better than  the  ones  you find in rival tomes, but
considering  the  amount  of  information   covered  it  is  far  from
sufficient.

So there we have it - the  Atari  compendium, the best book ever or an
overpriced, oversized door stop? Well, start believing the hype, it is
the best book ever. That's not to say that it is without its faults.
The DSP deserves a lot more  coverage,  but  to do justice to it would
require the size of the book to  double  so  it is best to get hold of
Motorola's DSP manual for this  purpose.  However,  there is no excuse
for not covering the Blitter chip. This chip has been around for aeons
and still there is no decent documentation  for it! No wonder it never
gets used.

Despite  these  omissions,  the  Atari  Compendium  remains  the  most
complete source of information  for  Atari  programmers  and I have no
hesitation in recommending it. It costs forty quid. Start saving now.
