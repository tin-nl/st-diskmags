By Terry Critic...

A searingly scatalogical and short study of those fruits of the 
Broadcasting Media GAMESMASTER and BAD INFLUENCE....(With a little 
word on CYBERZONE too..)

Firstly we are stretching the definition of 'Computer' somewhat to 
include those plain-wrapped receptacles of Japanese custom  chips, 
the  consoles,  in  fact  the programme format  gives  these  boxy 
objects  the lions share of coverage,  and computers are lucky  to 
get a scarce look in really..

GAMESMASTER,  The  Format:- An exceptionally brave or tranquilised 
Patrick  Moore  stands  in  as the  virtual  god-like  figure  the 
Gamesmaster  of the title,  whilst a Butlins Redcoat from the part 
of  Scotland  where failed medical experiments go to live  is  the 
Compere or Master of Ceremonies, various twelve year olds from the 
audience and celebrities who really should know better go to  play 
popular console and (sometimes) Amiga titles.. 

Audience:-  Gained  almost instantaneous following of  2  million, 
second  only to 'Brookside' on Channel Four,  don't know what  the 
present levels are (Yes I do, it is 3.1 million peeps watching..), 
but  this  second  series is going on for a lot  longer  than  the 
original... Should have 'all-ages' appeal as it is on at 6.30pm..

Presentation:-  Fairly thin on actual content,  two or three  game 
duels,  one of which is the 'Celebrity challenge',  a fairly brief 
reviews  section  (three  games only)  'Console-Tation'  tips  and 
cheats  section  controlled  by the  Gamesmaster,  the  occasional 
feature piece..  Most subjects are dealt with quickly, with little 
in-depth penetration of an issue...

Fame  Level:- Quite high,  many reviewers or commentators are from 
the  publishing  industry,   including  the  mysteriously  stopped 
editing  ST Format very recently,  Andy Hutchinson..  You may even 
get Archer Maclean to beat Jimmy White at snooker..

Innuendo  Level:- Regrettably bad,  Dominic constantly refers to a 
'Big  Purple Column' in the spin-off 'Gamesmaster' magazine..  You 
are  in immediate trouble with any game that has 'Uranus'  in  its 
title..

Credibility:-  Plenty  of  chances  for  Celebs  to  blow  it  all 
completely  away,  Including Vic Reeves (crap at the Comic  Relief 
game  'Sleepwalker')  Vinny Jones who was unsure of what  kind  of 
computer  he  owned  ("Uuurr A  Commodore..")  Blofeld-like  Super 
villain,  Commodore marketing manager Kelly Sumner..  Dominic does 
not  have to worry for himself though,  having none to lose in the 
first place..

Spins  offs:-  You  bet!  Gamesmaster  magazine,  Mugs,  T-shirts, 
keyrings,  tactical  nuclear  weapons emblazoned with the  Hewland 
Productions  satellite  logo pointing at Channel  Four  Buildings, 
Rotten Row, London SE1...(Orwhereveritis...)

Future:- The most promising of the three,  as it can trundle along 
happily  as  formula television in which roughly the  same  things 
happen  each week.  Interestingly,  advertising started off on the 
'cheap'  rate,  allowing software companies such as Microprose  to 
appear  in  the  mid-show break in the  first  series..  With  the 
success   of   'Gamesmaster'  Microprose  was   priced   out   and 
disapointingly  mainstream products such as handcreams and  toilet 
rolls are appearing instead.. Great! just what the kids want eh!

Overall:-  A  painless enough way of passing half an  hour..  Real 
gems  of information are few and far between,  and have a habit of 
slipping past almost before they have started..  (The Falcon/Amiga 
A1200/Acorn  comparison for E.G..) You may have a bit of a job  to 
overcome  your  physical revulsion of Dominic  Diamond..  Constant 
vomiting does not let you watch much of the show after all..   Did 
Patrick Moore just do it for the money??

€
BAD INFLUENCE:- the Format,  another half-hour show,  fewer glitzy 
bits and more content..  Not so audience/presenter based,  staffed 
with  relatively unknown but rising presenters Violet Berlin,  the 
short blonde leopard woman from Manchester, and Andy Crane.. 

Audience:-  Claims 4 million,  these will be mainly juvenile,  the 
programme goes out during the 'Watershed' period- Children's  hour 
before most people are back from work which limits my research  to 
one programme..

Presentation:-  More  informal  than  a  certain  other  programme 
Featured  a visit to a Virtual Reality arcade with  Violet  mainly 
shooting  at the floor with her virtual Phaser gun,  a visit to an 
American summer camp where they got to play with all the latest VR 
design kit,  an exclusive review of Lemmings II where the reviewer 
got to walk through a level, various other game reviews based on a 
rather  naff 'Boys n' Girls preferences' system..  If they are not 
careful this could become BLUE PETER for the cybernetic age..

Fame:- Rather low, the reviews were done by teenaged unknowns, who 
did a workmanlike job..

Innuendo level:- None, thank God..

Credibility:-  Sensibly limits what it tries to do,  stays  within 
the format of a childrens programme so nothing to lose..

Missed  Opportunity:-  Not their fault,  but the Atari Falcon  was 
shown in December,  apparently favourably received,  and ST-Format 
told us about it in January!! Arseholes!!

Spin-Offs:- Funnily enough, they do a magazine as well..

Miscellenous:-  Violet Berlin collects computer hardware  the  way 
most fetishists collect things from washing lines at Midnight, her 
collection includes an American SNES,  an official UK SNES,  an 8-
bit NES,  Game Boy, Game Gear, Lynx (hooray!), Master System, Mega 
Drive,  PC,  Amiga,  and  Apple  Mac..  (Why  not  just say one of 
everything except an ST!!) She now has to sleep in the boxroom  of 
her flat as the bedroom has been taken over by all this kit..

Future:- If 'Gamesmaster' keeps going,  ITV will surely want their 
own  programme to grab their audience share too..  Keep an eye out 
for a new series..

Overall:-  Another  reasonable  enough job,  less  constrained  by 
format than that other Channel Four show..

€
CYBERZONE:-  BBC's  effort,  this  is too crap for mere  words  to 
express..  Craig  Charles totally ruined by it,  'Thesp' character 
complete  rip-off of 'Gamesmaster' If you like wandering within  a 
giant  PC-type  freescape  game  which  is  still  fairly  limited 
graphically  speaking  by current standards,  and it is  the  same 
game EVERY week, that is fair enough.. Suffers from lack of change 
and zero novelty element, this will grow stale quickly....

Future:- Won't have one unless they change the format  drastically 
for  the next series,  a change of game scenarios every 2-3  weeks 
would be a good idea as well.. The standard of programming for the 
virtual world is merely ok rather than brilliant, there are better 
things  out  now on many home machines,  so they could improve  in 
that department.. Craig Charles, stick to Red Dwarf please....
