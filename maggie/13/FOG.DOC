Dear Falcon owner,

     Thank you for your enquiry with regard to the Falcon  Owners 
Group,  I  apologise  if it has taken a while to  send  you  this 
information  but  we are very busy at the moment and  people  are 
certainly  becoming more interested in the Falcon and  the  clubs 
activities.   Also  be  on the look out for a change  of  address 
which should happen sometime in late September of this  year,  we 
will  of course notify you of this,  but for the meantime I  hope 
the following information will be enough.

The  Falcon Owners Group was established on the 30.3.93  but  has 
only  recently opened to the general public.   We are  officially 
recognised  and supported by Atari UK and feel that  this  should 
reflect our dedication.   At present we offer four main areas for 
our members to benefit from, they are as follows :-

                          CLUB MAGAZINE

(i)  We  publish our own Falcon specific magazine  called  Falcon 
Update.  This is currently published quarterly but may well become 
bi-monthly after the new year depending on the increase in Falcon 
support  and members contributions.   Falcon Update contains  all 
manner  of articles including software reviews,  interviews  with 
well  known people from the Atari sector,  public domain  reviews, 
all  the  latest  news  from around  the  world  and  much  more.  
Professionally  printed  and  bound,  intelligently  written  and 
edited, it remains the best sole source of Falcon information.

                           COVER DISKS

(ii)  To accompany the magazine we produce our own special  cover 
disks  which are packed full with all the latest software we  can 
find that may be of interest,  everything from complete Direct to 
Disk  recording  packages to high quality True  Colour  pictures, 
there is a real selection for all.   The disk is high density for 
even  more value and as from issue two it will feature  a  unique 
shell  that will take all the hassle out of running  software  by 
copying  the  files to your hard disk,  depacking them  and  then 
running  them,  plus  it also checks for available  space  BEFORE 
proceeding and makes the whole cover disk process a joy to use.

                       DISCOUNT PD LIBRARY

(iii) As you may well already be aware we operate our own  public 
domain and shareware library.  All our disks are high density and 
packed to the brim with decent Falcon only software,  there is  a 
wealth of programs available and growing all the  time.   Members 
receive  huge discounts on their disks and also get one free  for 
every five they purchase.   A catalogue is sent free upon joining 
the club.

                         BULLETIN BOARDS

(iv)  As a member you will also be able to obtain free access  to 
our  special sections of selected bulletin boards.   We have  two 
sites open at present and both are operational 24 hours a day and 
can  support all speeds up to 14,400 baud.   A  free  instruction 
manual on using the BBS's is sent free with your membership  pack 
so do not worry if you are yet to try out the wonderful world  of 
comms.

At present the current rate of membership is œ16.99p for the year 
which  includes four issues of the magazine and a years worth  of 
discounts  from the PD library and bulletin boards.   However  we 
also  offer a trial period of just half a year for  œ9.99p.   All 
cheques  or postal orders should be made payable to  the  'Falcon 
Owners Group' and sent to the club address.
PD  Orders  however  should be made  payable  to  'The  Shareware 
Company' and sent to the FOG TSC address.

We  are always on the look out for new software  and  programmers 
should  write  for  special details on  membership  if  they  can 
provide  us  with exclusive titles.   We  also  welcome  overseas 
members, you should write for details about the membership prices 
but it does not usually go beyond œ20 sterling.  

So  if  you  think that FOG is for you then we  look  forward  to 
hearing  from  you  soon when you will become  a  member  of  the 
largest,  fastest  growing  and most active Falcon group  in  the 
world.

Yours sincerely,




Richard Davey
Club Chairman
