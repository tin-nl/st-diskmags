         Maggie & Co Visit Rutland Water on a Cycling Trip
        ---------------------------------------------------
                                    
Introduction.
-------------

Rutland Water is found in Leicestershire, United kingdom. It was
previously in the county of Rutland which has now been disbanded
due to its small size & the government policy of centralising
county council services.

Rutland Water is the largest man-
made reservoir in Western Europe and supplies most of Leicestershire 
withareliableyear-round water supply.

Statistics.

Ö(ÑBacktoWizard..)0Å

TÄhe aim of the trip is to cycle round the entire reservoir -
stopping at numerous pubs,inns,shops and other places.
     The following article is hopefully at attempted 'real-time'
affair and will be accessed at many occasions during the trip.
     It will not merely be a boring, long winded 'our-day-out'
type article - remember the Richard Karsmarkers buying a Sony CD
Player one in ST-News 8.1!!! - but will be the cross talk &
opinions of three ardent ST (& Other Computer) Users, who felt
that the only way the spend a glorious summer Sunday was the get
on their bikes and go!!!

     Before we go and further, this is after all a computer based
article, so for all you hardware freaks out there (Yeah!!) the
real time parts of this article are being typed on a DC-3000
Colour VGA 386SX-25 Notebook PC using Word-Perfect 6.0 & will
later be transfered to the ST as a generic text ASCII for Final
alterations, Formatting & justification using 1st Word (The
ONLY!! Word Processor for the ST according to CIH..)

Arrive Rutland water car-park 10:15
hire bikes (ú22.50 a day inc: ú10 deposit) 10:25
START 10:30!!!!

Ä
After a very very slow start the team began round the route
travelling in the west direction - as recommended by the beardy
bloke at the kiosk (too old to have ever completed the complete
route himself, but still an expert!!)

This present piece is being typed during the second stop of the
trip so far at approx 11:00 - now over to (fat) CIH....

CIH logon,,, ermm, the big hand is somewhere nearr the eleven, I
think I am dying >MOO!< (whatistallabout??) We are in a field full
of Jeff Minter's relatives.. I can't climb any 'hill-shaped
things' that well, but this is not surprising from somebody who
last rode a bike in the time BEFORE Maggie Thatcher came to
power.

(Thereisacowcometostareoverthefenceatuswhilstwework.
IthinkitisinterestedinthePC,soinadditiontoallour
othertroubles,wearenowrunningKomputerLiteracyforKows!!)

Will I make it to the first pub on the route?? Is the small
black bag on the back of his bike a portable oxygen tent, or a
small bodybag (Burial - for the use of..) READ ON..

Wizard in charge again as usual ===> Answer to CIH above ==>>
NO!!! - 15 minutes later & a forced stop half-way up the biggest
hill so far - those of us still full of energy (enter Quaser..)
have been sent to fetch refreshments for the larger members of
the team.

Time now is 11:30 & CIH has just drunk an entire tin of diet
coke in a single gulp.
Question: Are all Falcon owners told unfit or does it just seem
that way????

As you may have noticed from previous articles Quaser is
very critical of other people & their equipment. This did not
cease during the tour-de-reservoir.

Just in the past 5 minutes he has criticized the following:-

Man with the australian style hat.
The bloke who had the expensive mountain bike but still had to
walk up the hill,
The people with the fashionable cycling gear,
People who wear stupid style sun-glasses,
Everybody who was wearing a cycle-helmet,
& of course people stupid enough to buy A1200s (esp fro Dixons!!)

What a moaning little git,......

ÑAttheHorseandJockeyÄ,Ñapubinfestedwithhundredsofother

sunk..
Ä
Well its exactly 12:00 and we have finally managed to reach the
first pub on the journey (The Horse and Jockey).  Chris just
about managed the last mile with the promise of a cool drink and
a good long rest at the end of it.  Me (Quaser) am sitting here
and desperately looking for something to criticise. Well their is
still the favourite un-fit people with fashionable cycle atire
and of course the silly sunglasses that are obligatory fashion
accessory at this time of year for all middle age fathers who
have long since lost reminents of any dress sense that they may
have had.  I have also found the oppurtunity to critice Citreon
owners as we have a prime example of just such a primate who has
parked behind me in a manner more commonly associated with mini-
cab drivers.  Well thats enough moaning for now so over to CIH.

CIH back again... Well well well, we hit a good bit of proper
road, none of these steep hills with loads of scree at the
bottom, and horse dung to ride through, and (mercifully) NO STEEP
UPHILL bits.. There was one uphill section where I could have
swore I saw an angel beckoning me to the top holding a cool can
of coke, unfortunately it was only Quaser once the hallucination
cleared.. A pint of cider is helping me to compose this, it holds
the keyboard down whilst I type... (GLUG!) zaatttzzz better!!
Shit i'm fading fasssttt..... OOHH NOOOO The worst possible thing
has happened!!!  THE BATTERIES HAVE RUN OUT!!!!

Å(Premature)endofrealtimebit.....Ä

The rest of the article will have to be compiled from memory...
That will teach The Wizard to trust manfacturers when they state
'The batteries will provide 5 hours use when implementing the
power management software' - Bollox!!
     Talking of specifications - have you read the the specs for
the proposed Atari Jaguar. Nice!!, but the company will have gone
bust long before it gets released if they don't get their act
together ASAP..
