Hello everyone, this is my third, erm fourth outing in the sectors 
of this great publishing feat,  if Runrig or whatever he is called 
these days, ever gets around to doing any work....

And  this months burning topic is:- Can the whole  Computer  games 
bizzo  be called a religion,  do incredulous youngsters turn aside 
from wholesome beliefs to worship endlessly at the altar of a Blue 
hedgehog??

Do they bollocks!

They worship the image of the one called Super Mario instead!  But 
that is only my little joke,  along with popular music, TV, films, 
alright,  anything  called popular,  Computer games have attracted 
their  share of stick from the ultra-religious folks..  It has not 
yet got to the stage where messages from the evil one are  sampled 
backwards  and  played  back  with  the  soundtrack  for   'Mutant 
Mutilators  II',  but it won't be too long before somebody who  is 
very simple in the head (and American) will want games banned  for 
the most spurious of reasons..

In  which  case,  people like that should piss off and go back  to 
imagining flying saucers, or Elvis Presley is a Communist Spy..

The  Plymouth Brethren ban computers altogether,  along with  most 
other  things  that make up the 20th Century..  This may  be  less 
stupid than it seems, as one report has a Plymouth Brother looking 
at the early home computers in 1983 to see what was going on, came 
into  contact with an Oric,  and after several hours of trying  to 
RESET  it,  throwing the thing into the bin and issuing the  edict 
banning all computers..

The  Muslim  World's reaction to 'Satanic Verses  -  The  Platform 
game' remains,  thankfully,  unreported.. But it does not look too 
€good from here..

Don't  forget that all Bulletin Board users are saddo  pervos  who 
only  look  to build up their extensive  porn  collection,  whilst 
muttering the Lord's prayer backwards, these people should be shot 
and  washed thoroughly and made to do National Service with  short 
haircuts  or  something..  God  bless Mrs Thatcher,  death to  the 
traitorous  scum who kicked her out!!  Get that straitjacket  away 
from me now!!

Well let's consider the facts:-

Scorecard - Dead Bodies and unnecessary misery...

Organised religion - Several million..

Computer games freaks - Nil..

And that just about wraps that one up....

Before I go,  I have heard that for an undisclosed fee,  GOD, aka, 
the  big  one  has allowed his image to be  used  for  promotional 
purposes  other  than  for  himself..  I cannot  reveal  names  or 
products,  but  this advance advertising copy may give you  enough 
clues to be going on with..

"WHEN I WASH MY HAIR,  I DON'T USE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, I JUST 
LIKE TO WASH AND GOD!!

 Gussssspankk! 'Feb 1003

(Meanwhile in March..)

*ST Format update* It had to happen but it is very sad to see them 
in  foot-in-mouth  mode  again..   A  tradition  started  by  Andy 
€Hutchinson (And taken by him to Amiga Format?) is continued..  The 
March  edition  letters page has one response to a  typical  'Many 
questions'  letter on the Falcon..  Silica Systems are advertising 
Falcons with 1.44MB of RAM  so that they can better  compete  with 
the (2MB) Amiga A1200!! Very interesting, very wrong...

Silica  representatives  were  still recovering  from  a  laughter 
induced fit when asked to comment,  they merely giggled a bit when 
we asked them yesterday, then the phone went dead..
