          The   MJJ   A n o m a l y   M e g a d e m o

There  seems  to  be  something of an  explosion  of  recent  demo 
releases,  as  several crews decide it is no longer worth  hanging 
onto  their code that has been kicking around for  years,  because 
the ST may well be really ready to kick the bucket this time..

ST  Magazine  editor:- "But they can't just ditch  the  ST  scene, 
there are just too many people out there for software producers to 
ignore.."

Software Company Chief:- "Oh yes we can!!!"

But enough of this little digression and on to this review of a 2-
Disk megademo (All screens STFM,  no trace of STE coding, although 
all screens work perfectly on the STE..)

In order, from the top etc...

1st Intro...  'Oil' oozes down the screen, screen clears to reveal 
a picture of a seabird covered in the black gunky stuff.. A looped 
dramatic  classical  type sample plays continuously..  (The  Amoco 
Cadiz screen according to the authors..)

Loader...  Looped bluezy 'De la Soul' sample plays,  multicoloured 
text zooms in and out (And tells you what is on each screen..)

2nd Intro... Some very very nice graphics, a cross between 'Alien' 
and  'Shadow  of the Beast' If this is 16 colour only,  then  they 
make  very  good use of the palette..  Ends up with giant  'Beast' 
lettering  introducing the title of the demo 'Anomaly'..  A module 
plays this time.. (Good screen..)

Main  menu...  A take-off of 'Marble Madness' or 'Spindizzy'  with 
three graphically different levels to travel through to get to all 
the  screens..  Some of the screens are at the top of steep slopes 
and  can be quite challenging for people called Dave to  get  to!! 
Ball control is from the Cursor Keypad with no joystick option..

(The First screen)

Syncro  Effects...  This  gives you a foreground image,  and  it's 
magnified equivalent as the background,  starting with the sort of 
horrible face we often see at the Wellingboro' Computer Club, then 
moving  on  to  some sineously distorted text,  then  some  plasma 
working off a predominantly red-green-black palette..  Moving then 
to  a Raster coloured scroller which distorts and crushes  up  and 
down as well..

Finally  a  return to the first effect,  as several  portraits  of 
ugly programmers and their magnified background equivalents  flash 
up on to the screen..

Karaoke...  A  slightly unforgettable screen,  a very simple idea, 
you wonder why nobody else had taken this up before, then you look 
at the 'essential Frenchness' of the thing and realise why..

A  menu  gives you the choice of several French and  a  couple  of 
English  nursery  rhymes (Which happen to be 'Old  MacDonald'  and 
'Humpty  Dumpty')  Selecting one of these gives you the  tune  and 
also the lyrics which are traced onto the screen at the point  you 
should  join  in..  The  tunes are very much  'adaptions'  of  the 
originals,  imagine  an  Amiga-style electric guitar  for  'Humpty 
Dumpty'.. (or better still, try not to..)

Graphics are sparse,  and join in with the humourous general theme 
of the screen..

Oxygene Guest screen...  3-D bob sprites forming a scroller in the 
manner  of  the Tanis effort in 'Ooh Crikey' but  these  ones  are 
encased within a 3-D vector box which rotates around the  screen.. 
Another  migraine  causer if you try to read too much of  it..  An 
easier  to read standard scroller is also provided in  the  bottom 
border, music is soundchip and very familiar..

Fullshades... A multiscroller with many layers of very small text, 
with  a fullscreen wave-effect which is close to plasma,  and with 
changing raster colours that reinforce this impression.. Choice of 
two soundchip tunes from somewhere on the keyboard as well..

Little Marie... Another 'unforgettable' French screen which serves 
as a terrible reminder that French people are on the increase  all 
the  time..  Dedicated to somebody who is clearly not a virgin and 
their   baby  daughter..   Module  with  baby-sounds,   fullscreen 
'bouncing  wallpaper' with babies bottles,  and a silly scrolltext 
complete this one..

(Disc B)

Greetings... A shady sineous text in mid-screen, NAOS-like logo at 
the  top,  Different 'greetings' logo at the bottom,  starfield in 
the  middle (Side-to-side variety..) The whole lot bounces up  and 
down.. Tune a remix of an old Rob Hubbard hit 'Sanxion' - Now just 
see if your name is there..

Boring  Colours...  A  very  large  screen,  with  many  different 
effects,  starting  with the commonplace boring vertical  rasters, 
then  exploring  many variations of these and then  moving  on  to 
several totally new patterns..

My powers of description will shortly take a well-earned  vacation 
to  somewhere  sunny  with  lots of swimming  pools,  but  in  the 
meantime,  there  were several patterns with variations on the ULM 
raster theme, and one part of the demo had an effect like vertical 
blinds  blowing  in the wind,  another part had several  patterned 
globes..  Tendency  to  dilute  the  showmanship  by  repeating  a 
particular  effect  a  bit too much,  but overall  some  promising 
effects if you are into that 'Colourshock' stuff..

Dots  Everywhere...  NOT more sineous bezier curves for a  change, 
but  several  symmetric patterns,  several flowing  and  expanding 
multi-patterns,  flowing  tubes,  and  some complex plasma/contour 
landscape effects flowing up and down the screen..  A bit like the 
last  screen if you like a lot of a particular kind of  effect  in 
one place..

Cochon Qui Ait...  Another French influence screen,  with a unique 
game (The pig game) Some well presented graphics for the pig,  and 
some  very nicely drawn dice..  The objective to stick the bits on 
the pig (Eyes, ears, legs, tail) by getting the appropriate number 
on the dice and finishing before the computer opponent.. And there 
is a module player as well..

The  Bla Bla Screen...A form of greetings/crew information  screen 
with  a fullscreen vertical scroller with much text,  and multiple 
pictures of a 'Giraphus Zebrus Bubblus Gward' (A safely  fictional 
ridiculous-looking creature..) More module music as well..  To get 
the  full  benefit of this screen,  a good knowledge of French  is 
needed..)

DNT Guestscreen...  Multipart, Large multicoloured centrescroller, 
hitting  'Space'  produces  a  sineous  pattern  with  some   more 
text,'Space' again for some plasma effects..

Diskfiller...  The  story  of  Mr Costard (Who  bears  an  uncanny 
resemblance to Mr Square in the English editions) who tries to get 
into his house,  has no key, lifts up the house, which then falls 
on him and splat! A cautionary moral tale in there somewhere.. The 
demo  itself  takes  the form of a picture  displayer  and  module 
music..

Future Minds Guestscreen...  Starts with a cute small logo, then a 
city-scape   with   the  large  text   'Justified   and   Ancient' 
superimposed  over  the  top.  Followed by  another  fast  fractal 
generator, but before I switch-off and go to sleep there is also a 
split-screen  effects  with  four  different  images  of  fractals 
generating..

2nd part..  Central multiscroller,  onrushing starfield, with some 
3-D  objects and 'Future Minds' lettering,  some contact addresses 
make  their  way  in as well as some  large-pixel  sineous  spline 
curves..

Final  Bit...  "The  End" lettering set in a red and  white  wavey 
kitchen tile pattern effect..

Reset...  Octopus  logo,  then  a  spagetti/worm bath (*)  pattern 
onscreen with text appearing over the top..  These are the credits 
for  the various screens on the demo..  The top and bottom borders 
have ben removed, some more digi-sound too..
(*)This is a totally apt description of this effect!!

(There seems to be a hidden screen, a door on a separate island on 
the  main  menu not normally get-attable,  is this truly a  hidden 
screen or just a wind-up by MJJ??)


And now, the end is near...

Ratings..

Graphix:-  84%  - We could be pushing into the low '90's  for  the 
intro screens, good job done on the main-menu too..

Sonix:-  82%  - Strong digi-sound presence,  with several  goodish 
modules  and  samples..  No STE replay routines,  soundchip  tunes 
mostly old 'Favourites'..

Gee-Whiz:- 88% - Some expansion into new territory of  established 
ideas,   particularly  'Boring  Colours'  and  'Dots  Everywhere', 
general high standard of coding throughout..

Overall:-  85%  -  Yet another 'Last Gasp' for the  ST,  (STFM  at 
least..)  This  may be their last demo on the ST..  I would be  so 
bold to suggest:-
                  1.  Get a Falcon..

                  2.  Do loads of graphics in the style of  those                       
                      stylish intros in truecolour or 256 colours. 

                  3.  Get Little Marie busy with an assembler and 
                      see what she comes up with..

                  4.  Revamp  the  Karaoke screen with  the  new 
                      superb Falcon 16-Bit sound.. 
 
And I think that will be it for now..
