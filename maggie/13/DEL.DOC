     Why have I called this article 'Believe it or Not'? .... well,
having been requested by several readers of Maggie 11 to give a few 
more funny, but true, stories of the things I encountered from some
people who came into my retail computer software shop (before I went
mail order only) I decided, particularly as this article is intended
to grace the Christmas 93 issue of Maggie, to keep things funny and
jovial in an attempt to brighten up the end of what has proved to be
yet another year of trade recession here in Britain.

     I sometimes believe that it is only by possessing the gift of a
sense of humour that most of we mortals survive at all! Thank God for
those customers (or potential customers at least) who used to lift
what might otherwise have been a most dull and uninteresting day in
the shop by either using their wit or by coming out with the most
hilarious statements or requests. Understandably, it is these type
of people I can recall with clarity from years, sometimes many years,
ago while those who used to be clever and somewhat arrogant in their
dealings with me I have little or no recollection of.

     Apart from the spoken 'howlers' which I witnessed, some of the
funniest events were in the form of written 'howlers' having been
part of the contents of some of the many letters I used to receive
(and still do!) on the mail order side of my business. I think I will
deal with these written funnies first:


LETTERS REGARDING COMMERCIAL GAMES (OR OTHER MATTERS!)

First, four from overseas ...

     'Please. My English is much not. Is your my country speak
much not? I put in lines what I am want. I put in not monies at
this yet. I wait see if it is. If it is I speak so. If it is not
I speak no. I wait now if want come soon.'.
     (I sent him a Catalogue Disk ... let him sort it out ..!)

     'Sometime on disk I see one then another. I not see different
on some disk. Do YOU have many of some different? I have only a
little different and wanting more than this different. If you get
different I can have some. I will send then different if it is
not with you.'.
     (Loves that word 'different' doesn't he ..? Anyway I sent
      HIM a Catalogue Disk too!)

     'I am wanting pubic friendship with English ST person ....'.
      (I think he meant PUBLIC domain swapping .. at least I hope
       so ..!)

     This overseas client had kindly forwarded a stamped, addressed
envelope for my reply .. a fact he mentioned at the end of his
letter .. ' ..... I have stamped on the envelope. I hope I have
stamped on it correctly. If I have not please stamp on it again.'.


Now from nearer to home ...

     Dear Sir, If you will please send me Terminator for the STE I
will forward the money when I get my dole money next week .... (I
didn't send it you may be surprised to know!).

     Dear Sir, I am returning this disk (Chase HQ) as I left it on
the floor and our Labrador chewed it. Is it possible for you to re-
copy it or something? .... (The disk in question was so toothmarked
and mis-shapen that there was no way in which anyone could have 
got it into the diskdrive!).

     Dear Sir, When I was on holiday in Blackpool last week I came
into your shop and bought Lotus Espirit for the ST. Unfortunately,
I was leaning over the railing on the sea wall while the tide was
in and it fell into the water. There was no way to go down the
wall and as the water level was far below us we couldn't fish it
out in any way. We waited for ages until the tide turned and went
out hoping the box would be left on the sands but the waves took
the box out to sea before the tide went out. I remember that you
put a receipt inside the box which had your shop's address on it.
On the off-chance that another tide brought the box back in to
shore and somebody opened it and found your address and handed it
in to you, perhaps you could forward it to the above address and
I will gladly send you your postage. ..... (Now you might find
this hard to believe but that box was never seen again .. unless
someone in Ireland or on the Isle of Man or perhaps even across
there in Sweden or Norway got themselves a free 'Lotus Espirit'
game complete with soggy cardboard and seawater!).

     Dear Sir, When I was on holiday last week I came to your 
shop. I didn't buy anything as I don't have a computer. I am 
wondering if you found a plastic bag (green) with handles. You
see I left my childrens' balls in it and they were upset when
they realised they had lost them cos you can't get those kind 
of balls where we live and although we are coming back to your
town next year for another holiday I don't want my kiddies to
have to wait that long to replace their balls. .... (There's no
answer to that one really is there?).

     Dear Sir, While visiting Blackpool on holiday recently I
came into your shop. You may remember me, we had a chat and I
told you that I had just bought an Atari ST in my home town of
- - - - - - (censored .. Del). I did buy a pack of ten blank
disks off you but when I got them home and opened them there
were no instructions with them. Could you please forward the
instructions . I enclose a stamped, addressed envelope. ....(I
replied and referred the customer to his Atari handbook!).

     Dear Sir, Can you help me? I sold my Amiga and purchased
one of the new Atari STE's. With games being the price they are
I did not part with my Amiga games as I had paid up to œ25.00
for some of them. Unfortunately I just cannot get them to run
on the STE and I cannot understand why as the Amiga took a 
three and a half inch disk just like the Atari STE. .... (The
gentleman's name is not being disclosed in order to protect
the innocent!).

     To the Owner, Do you buy second-hand modems? I have only had
it for just over 5 months but our telephone bill has gone up from
between œ45.00 to œ55.00 a quarter to over œ390.00! I didn't
get it from your shop but I do think that the man at another shop
who sold it to me should have told me just how much more they
put on your 'phone bill! .... (I didn't buy it ....!).

     Dear Sir, I have just got an Atari STFM 520 and I have
Hyper Paint too. I am not very good at drawing or painting and
wondered if you have any programs which will draw and paint for
me. .... (The answer just had to be no ..!)

     Dear Sir or Madam, I used to have an MSX which I sold to get
an Atari ST. I have over 100 games in their boxes (only little
boxes because as you know they are all on tapes). I don't know if
you do exchanges with games but if you do I will accept 25 full-
price games for my MSX ones (that is 4 MSX games for 1 ST game).
I might even take 1 ST game for every 5 MSX games, it depends on
the titles. ....(I bet he would !!).

     Dear Sir, I saw your advert in a magazine for Public Domain
disks. Do you send PD disks out on approval? That way I could try
them first and return any I don't like with the money for those
I do like. Don't think that I would copy them or anything like
that and then send them all back to you saying I don't like them.
Please reply soon. .... (I did ......... NO!).

     Dear Sir, I am having to return 4 of your Public Domain
disks which will not load on my Atari 520 STFM. I know that they
are listed in your disk catalogue as being '1 Meg' but I thought
that you meant the disk drive had to be 1 meg and mine is but the
memory isn't. .... (Its not all that easy running a PD/Shareware
library .. that is just one of many similar letters!).

     Dear Sir, I visited your shop last Saturday afternoon while on
a day trip to Blackpool. Perhaps you recall me, we chatted about a
disk drive for the C64 and I purchased the game Trivial Pursuit.
Unfortunately I left my spectacles and case in one of the shops I
visited but cannot remember which one it was. I know it was in your
area. If it was your shop and you found them perhaps you could
forward them on to me. It is most important that I get them back
as I can do nothing without them and can barely see my hand in
front of my face ....  (For ages after I wondered .... how the
hell did he manage to write that letter ...?).

     (Reminds me of the guy who walked up to the optician and the
optician raised his hand and said 'Don't tell me Sir ... let me
guess. Yes .. you need those spectacles with quarter inch thick
lenses and extremely close contact vision ..!'.  The man said
'That's marvellous ..! You haven't even examined me yet ..! How
did you know that ..?'. The optician said 'I knew it the minute
you walked through the window!'.).



THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY ..!

     There follows a small selection of some of the remarks made
over the counter of my shop by people of various ages ..

     Man, after standing for some considerable time studying the
various games on my wall and counter racks in 1992 .. 'They don't
seem to be bringing much out for the Vic 20 nowadays do they?'.

     'I've never been much good at spelling so I bought myself
one of those word processors ... but it's no better than I am!'.

     'I think one joystick's just like another ... they're all
knackered in about a week!'.

     'My lad's been on about Amigas .. he's after one. He's been
going on about it using a mouse and all that but I told him ..
you've got along fine for five years with your Spectrum and that
doesn't even need a mouse!'.

     Young boy, with mother, lovingly eyeing an STE on display in
a glass showcase .. 'Look Mum .. that's an Atari I told you about'.
Mum .. 'You're not having one .. you can get germs with them!'.
(I tried to explain to her what a virus was but she informed me
that she was 'not going to take any chances, particularly as
there is a new baby in the house!').

     A young boy, about five, seemed determined one day to climb
the outer face of my glass counter to get on the top so I drew
the attention of his mother and father who were looking at games
on the shop wall to this. The mother turned and shouted at the boy
'If you fall off that counter and break your legs don't come
running to me!'.

     My son's only ten but he's an absolute genius on the computer ..
give him any game you want and he can play it!'.

     'Oh yes .. it's a good game, but I can't get away from the
octopus .. it keeps killing me with its testicles ..'.

     'I can truly say that I don't believe in buying copied disks ..
I've never had a single one .. by the way you don't happen to sell
the manual for Deluxe Paint III by itself do you ..?'.

     'I bought one of those cheap second disk drives for my ST ..
it was about as much use as a one-legged man in an arse-kicking
contest ..!'.

     A young lad about 8 talking to me in the shop ... 'I'd love
an ST .. I think I'm getting one in December for Christmas .. I
told my mum about them and she said that it would be a cold day
before she paid out all that much money for a computer ..'. (I
just couldn't tell the poor kid!).

     A snippet of a conversation being carried on in the shop
between two young schoolboys ..

1st boy .. 'My dad's got an Amiga'.
2nd boy .. 'My dad's got a PC'.
1st boy .. 'My dad uses an art program'.
2nd boy .. 'Well my dad uses a word processor and a laser printer ..
            and at work he is the boss of the computer section and
            he's in charge of all the important programming and he's
            got over 30 people under him ..'.
1st boy ..  ' ...... Well my dad's completed level 2 of 'Robocop' ..!'.

                     (No contest ..!)

     
     'I'm new to computers ... do they ever need oiling at all ..?'.

     'I've just got an STE .. how do you get it to talk ..?'.

     'My wife won't go near my computer .. she says it frightens
her after all those science fiction films on TV ..'.

Lady customer ... 'I can't understand why it doesn't remember
      anything when it's switched off ... after all we dream when
      we are asleep don't we ..'.

     With my shop having specialised in Atari hardware and software
the Amiga owners who came in were often taunted by some of my ST
fanatic clients, for example ...

     'I've a real soft spot for the Amiga'.
     'Yeah .. it's called a swamp!'.
     'You've never had a good word for the Amiga you haven't!'.
     'Yes I have ..... crap!'.

     'I got a new joystick for my Amiga last week'.
     'Bloody hell ... that was a good swap!'.

     'I'm upgrading my Amiga soon'.
     'What are you doing ... swapping it for an Oric?'.

     'I was working on the Amiga till 3'o'clock this morning ..'.
     'Did you finally get it going ...?'.

     'I've just joined the local weekly Amiga club .. I'm  meeting
      the other members on Thursday night'.
     'I hope you like him ...!'.

     'There's a lot to be said for the Amiga ...'.
     'What can you say about the Amiga that hasn't already been
      said about blocked drains ..?'.

     'There's no way you can compare the ST with the Amiga ..'.
     'Was you father a weightlifter ..?'.
     'No ... why?'.
     'He must have been to have raised a dumbell like you ..!'.

     'I do everything but go to bed with my Amiga ..'.
     'You want to try doing that too .. that's all it's fit for ..!'.
                 (A very subtle one that ..!)

     A young man was looking at a large boxed game one day in the
shop. 'Why do they have such a big box when inside it there's only
a small instruction leaflet and a little disk?', he asked. Jokingly
I said, 'Perhaps it's so that there will be plenty of air in there
to let the disk breath ..'. To my surprise he studied my reply
thoughtfully for a while and then said, 'Well why do they seal the
disk in a small plastic bag then ..?'.   (It was later that I
discovered that his friends called him 'Bungalow'. I asked one of
them quietly 'Why do you call him 'Bungalow'?'. 'Simple ..', came
the reply, 'He's got nothing upstairs ..!').




ANY CHANCE OF FIXING IT .....?

     In each of the following cases the owner of a 'damaged'
computer presented himself at my shop counter with the computer
in his hands. I add a brief extract from the owner's explanation
as to what had caused the damage ...

     'My little brother pushed a big biscuit into the diskdrive
when I wasn't there .. I've pressed the eject button but all it
does is crumble it ..'

     'I was taking it downstairs and it slipped out of my hands
and bounced all the way to the bottom ... can it be mended?' (He
was carrying a box with about 20 assorted pieces of computer in
it!).

     'I dropped a glass of fruitjuice onto it and the keys don't
seem to work now ... the joystick's not too clever either ..'.

     'I was cleaning my desk and I put the computer on my swivel
chair while I wiped the desk top .. just then the phone rang and
I forgot and sat on it. The chair swung round and I ended up on
the floor .. so did the computer .. as I slipped I grabbed out
to save myself and ripped the leads out of my monitor so that
doesn't work now either ..'.

     'The disk didn't seem to want to go into the diskdrive so I
gave it a thump ... I hadn't realised the disk was upside down
and now I can't get it out ..'.

     'It got damaged in the furniture removal van when we were
moving house .. a wardrobe fell on it .. and when the men moved
the wardrobe one of them let his hold slip and it fell on it
again ..'.

     'Can you clean the inside for me .. my mum was cleaning my
bedroom window and spilled her bucket of water on it and now it
won't light up! ..'.

     'I was just sitting there using it when this huge piece of
plaster dropped from the ceiling .. some of it hit me on the head
but most of it landed on the keyboard and shattered ...'.

     'It was strapped to the seat behind me on my motorbike when
I swerved to miss a cat and came off ... I ended up in a hedge
but the computer didn't ...'.

     'My dad said that if he ever again came into my bedroom at
2'o'clock in the morning and found me playing on it he would
throw it against the wall ... well he did .. I was .. and he did!'.

     'It was on the front passenger seat in my car when the bus
hit me on that side ... it's a bit buckled ...'.

     'One minute it was on top of the wardrobe and the next minute
it was on the floor ...!'.


     (Oh boy ... some folks have all the luck ..!)


NOW WHAT WAS IT CALLED .......?


     Some of the customers to my shop just could not remember the
the title of the game they wanted .. sometimes with very funny
results! Judge for yourself ... 

     'You know .. it's that game where fire comes out of the back
of the 'plane ...'. (It was 'Afterburner' ..!).

     '.. and if the man gets enough balls he changes ..!'. (This one
was 'Altered Beast ..!).

     '.. It's an adventure about a man and a native church in the
jungle .. you must know it!'. (This was 'Indiana Jones and the Temple
of Doom ..!).

     'Now what was it my son asked me to get ..? ... (lady) ... What
do you call those men who come out and tow your car home if it breaks
down ..?'. Me .. 'The AA ..?'.  Lady .. 'No ..'. Me .. 'The RAC ..?'.
Lady .. 'That's it ...! Lombard RAC Rally!'.

     A middle-aged gentleman spent a few minutes at my counter one
day urgently trying to recall the name of the game he required for
his grandson. 'I know it's something to do with faulty wiring .. you 
know, electrical things breaking down ..'. It transpired that he was
looking for the game 'Short Circuit'  ...

     Then there was the lady who came in and said that she wanted
'Ghostbusters' for her son who was at school. I showed her the box
but she said, 'No ..! It has to be the proper one!'. Just a little
puzzled at this, I showed her 'Ghostbusters II'. 'No ..', she said,
'.. that's not right, he wants the PROPER one!'. We decided between
us that it would be better if she brought her son into the shop
when school was over. She did so later in the day .. and the game he
wanted ..? It was 'Real Ghostbusters' ..!'.

     One of my favourite stories regarding folks who could simply
not bring to mind the game which someone else had asked them to buy
for them concerned a lady who came into the shop one particularly
busy Saturday afternoon when most of my Amiga and ST regular lads
were browsing through the various games for their respective computers.

     The lady stood glancing around the wall display units at the games
and was obviously most uncertain about matters. I asked her if I could
be of any assistance and she replied, 'It's my son's birthday tomorrow.
He has an Amiga and he has his heart set on a certain game and I have
come in to get it .. the trouble is I have forgotten was it's called'.

     I asked her if she knew what type of game it was .. was it a
recent release or an older game ..etc. She hesitated and then said,
'Actually it isn't just one game .. it's two games in one if you know
what I mean. One is about that steel American policeman and the other
is one of those 007 spy games .. you know .. Sean Connery was in the
films ..'.

     By this time all my regular teenage customers had become most
interested and began to try to help the lady by reeling off the
names of the various James Bond 007 films which had a computer version.
'You Only Live Twice ..?'.  'Licenced to Kill ..?'. 'The Spy Who Loved
Me ..?' ......, but all to no avail .. the lady just kept on shaking
her head and sighing 'No ..'.
 
     We all of us persevered however, until suddenly and without
warning the lady pointed excitedly up towards a large box game on my
top shelf. 'That's it ...!', she almost shouted, 'That's the one up
there ..!'.

     All eyes followed the direction in which the lady's finger pointed.
For a moment there was absolute silence in the shop before the lads
began to rock with laughter ... the game in question was .......
'James Pond II - Robocod' ...!!

     There was one instance where I just could not bite my lip but
had to grin from ear to ear. An elderly lady came into the shop and
explained that she wanted a game for her grandson but had forgotten
what it was called, except that '.. It's about those little animals
who go to the edge of a cliff now and again and toss themselves off..'.
     (Yeah .. it was 'Lemmings'!)


          Well, that's enough for this issue ... if you would like more
'howlers' in future issues of 'Maggie' DO let us know because believe
me ... I have a barrel full!

     As this is the Christmas 94 issue of 'Maggie' I cannot end
without saying 'A very merry Christmas and a happy, healthy and
successful 1994' to Chris (Editor of 'Maggie'), Felice (Assistant
Editor) ...(thanks for your friendship and support in 1993 Richard),
to Mark and Dave and other members the British 'Maggie' team and to
all the various contributors (too numerous to mention right here),
to Michael and the other members of 'Delta Force' and to the coders
and crews in Britain, the rest of Europe, Australia, Canada, the
USA  and wherever else you may be. A special greeting to MSD, Oz and
Boris of 'POV' based here in Blackpool (thanks for all your help
Mark!), and, of course, my very best wishes to all my friends and
clients everywhere and to ALL ST'ers whoever you are and wherever
you are!

     And with the rising Falcon and the impending release of the
Jaguar, let's hope that 1994 is a year of restoration of confidence
by the trade in all Atari products .. including the good old ST!!


                           Keep smiling  ..
