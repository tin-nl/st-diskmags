ANNA FRIEL - THE REVIEW.....

It  is  not very often that a star from British  TV  serials  and 
programmes is ever that good to warrant a mention normally in the 
pages  of this illustrious diskmag,  but Anna Friel is  something 
different.

It  was only in the late summer last year that Anna Friel  joined 
the cast of the popular Channel 4 soap "Brookside".   Anna, along 
with another (unknown until now) actress,  Sandra Maitland,  play 
the  parts  of a wife and a daughter who were  abused  badly  and 
beaten up by their "father", and the aftermath.

Both actresses play the parts of the terrorised Jordache  family, 
who are living in a safe-house in Brookside Close.

Their  performances so far since they arrived on the  scene  have 
been stunning.......to say the least,  alongside with the  beauty 
of Anna Friel to boot.   British actresses have always been given 
the cold shoulder in the past by Hollywood for being too "boring" 
and not attractive enough for films - we hope Anna gets the break 
she deserves.

When they arrived on the scene,  things moved in a weird way...to 
say the least.  Sandra was shown to have bruises on her legs that 
were  a  result of being battered by her  violent  husband.   Her 
husband was sent to prison to serve some years - but he came back 
-  and  the  performances started to  improve  with  breathtaking 
horror.....especially when the husband,  Trevor,  was stabbed  to 
death  by Anna (who played the daughter,  Beth) in a  scene  that 
looked  straight  out of the magnificent horror film  "The  Kiss" 
starring Joanna Pacula.  However, there was more to come......

Trevor  was  buried in the garden and the patio was  extended  to 
cover the body.   The Jordaches thought that their troubles  were 
over.....until  Trevor's  sister Brenna  appeared  from  nowhere, 
€and,  after going through the funeral process (which was not  for 
Trevor) she wanted Trevor's ring.  So Beth and Sinbad (one of the 
Brookside residents - who used to do the window cleaning) had  to 
dig Trevor up - in a scene that was excellently filmed.

After  Brenna departed,  the  Jordaches  thought,  again.....that 
their troubles were over........until the Shackletons (the owners 
of  the safe house where the Jordaches live) announced that  they 
wanted  to  build  an  extension in the  garden  to  house  other 
families in the same position as the Jordaches..............

As  I have said previously,  the performances of all involved  in 
this plot have been excellent - with Anna Friel coming out as the 
best  overall.   I  hope  that Anna gets her  reward  of  joining 
Hollywood  sometime in the future........even starring  alongside 
the  ranks of Meredith Salenger,  Corey Feldman &  Joanna  Pacula 
in a future movie sounds good..........if it happens.
