address for the PD library only, plus we can now accept credit card 
orders over the phone which is also now manned (NOT a machine!) during 
the daytime.  There are also new disk prices too but we still offer the 
best value for money around, but most import of all is the new disks and 
superb new Falcon only programs we now have in stock.  

                           (*) NEW ADDRESS (*)

The FOG PDL is now being run by Ronald Walker who has had many years 
experience in the field and will promise you a very fast and efficient 
service, a typical order taking only one day to process, order by credit 
card and you can expect your disks the next day.

Please note that Ronald also runs a huge and popular Atari ST library and 
therefore when ordering or requesting a catalogue you must always make 
sure you request the FALCON list.

                           (*) NEW PRICES (*)

As of the 2nd September 1993 the prices for public domain software will 
be as follows :-

Members of the Falcon Owners Group pay only œ1.90p per disk.
NON Members of the Falcon Owners Group pay  œ2.25p per disk.

You MUST quote your membership number to get the discount.  The above 
prices include first class postage and packing within the UK, orders from 
Europe should add œ1.00p to the total and orders from overseas should add 
œ2.00p to the total.  

                           (*) FREE DISKS (*)

                      This is for FOG members ONLY.
                      ----------------------- ^^^^

If you are a member of the Falcon Owners Group then you can claim one 
free disk of your choice for every five your purchase from the Pd 
library.  Yes that's six disks for the price of five.

                             (*) NOTICES (*)

First of all please note that all our disks are on HIGH DENSITY disks, 
that means 1.44Mb of space and LOTS more files for you.  Also sometimes 
the programs have been compressed to allow even more information on the 
disk, sometimes these files are self extracting and therefore need to be 
copied to a hard disk and then run in order to use the program.  Other 
times the program has been packed with a popular packer like ICE 2.4 or 
Sentry 2.05, these are just programs that squash the original files down 
saving disk space for you.  The program Mega Depacker v2.2 will DEpack 
these files should you need it, its on UFOG 016.

                             (*) UPDATES (*)

This disk catalogue is updated as soon as a new title arrives.  Members 
of the Falcon Owners Group will receive a new copy of the catalogue free 
of charge approx. once a quarter.  If you are not a member then you are 
requested to return your original disk along with a S.S.A.E for a new 
copy.  Or simply send three first class stamps and we will send one by 
return of post.

                              (*) SWAPS (*)

We have contacts all over the world with whom we swap the latest Falcon 
software, however if you own some programs not listed in this catalogue 
then please feel free to send them in and swap them for any disk/s of 
your choice.  Please send a list before sending disks as we receive new 
software all the time.

                           (*) PROGRAMMERS (*)

If you have written a piece of Falcon specific software with a view to 
releasing it either as Shareware or Licenseware then we would like to 
hear from you.  We will operate our own Licenseware scheme should we 
receive any titles worthy of the label.  Shareware programmers we can be 
an agent for your software, again please write to us enclosing full 
details and a sample of the program.  We do not promise piles of money to 
come rolling in but the more succesful programs can make substantial 
earnings, especially considering how new the Falcon is.  I'mm quite sure 
people would even welcome a Falcon Tetris clone!  

                        (*) THAT'S ALL FOLKS (*)

Well thank you for requesting a copy of our disk catalogue, we hope you 
find some software that interests you and look forward to hearing from 
you soon.  Remember - It pays to be a member of the Falcon Owners Group.

                         (*) FALCON SOFTWARE (*)


TFOG 001 : 13 MODULES + PLAYER
This disk contains 13 hot Amiga soundtracker modules ported across to
the Falcon for playing at a better quality than even on the Amiga! 
With 50kHz, 16 channel emmulation providing the best output ever, the
replayer is Pro Tracker V2.1a from Griff of Electronic Images.  The
modules are :- Absence Live, Ace, Acid, Acied, Ackerli, Axel F,
Beasti, Beyond, Dance Little Bird, Blazzering, Blue Monday, Celscape
and Chance.


TFOG 002 : 13 MORE MODULES, NO PLAYER
Another excellent set of modules from rave to rock, but no room for a
module player so this disk must be used in conjunction with another
from this range.  The modules are :- Cluster, Coca Cola Rumba, Vandal
and Statics COMA, Cruelty in the house, Deejay, Space Delirium, Delta
Remix, Dolly Moon, Drives Me Crazy and Empty Space.


TFOG 003 : 16 MODULES + PLAYER
Yes another collection but this time three extra and the Pro Tracker
replayer is back.  This collection feature some hit tracks from Amiga
musicians such as Romeo Knight of Red Sector and 4-Mat of Anarchy. 
The modules are :- Enola Gay, Equinox, Fantasy, Flash 4, Fox,
Frequency, Futura, Get Up, Gold Runner, Goodlife, Hit Me, Image
Flight, Knight, Lastnite, Light and Loader.


AFOG 004 : LOADSA FONTS
This is a truly stunning collection of no less than 90 different
fonts from monochrome to full colour, all in the Degas PC1 format for
extra compression.  These are the sort of fonts you would see in the
big mega demos that scroll across the screen and as such can be cut
and pasted from within your own favourite art package.  There are
more than anyone could ever need and ranging in size from 8X8 up,
with a whole host of designs from Gothic to Steel.


MFOG 005 : ST NEWS 7.3
Although not strictly Falcon only, this is an example of magnetic
publishing at its best.  It includes some fantastic articles and
excellent science fiction stories plus lots of news about the Falcon.
My favourite is the history of mega demos.  Excellent stuff.


AFOG 006 : PICTURES GALORE
This disk is not yet full but includes no less than 50 IFF pictures,
all of AMAZING quality having been ripped from commercial games and
demos, everything from the Terminator to Amazon women.  We are also
going to add some more pictures soon.


TFOG 007 : YET ANOTHER 14 MODULES + PLAYER
Back to the best sounding stuff to float from your stereo, more
awesome tunes including a brilliant rendition of the Iron Maiden
Lucasade advert track, take it away Daley!  The modules are :- Logan,
Lowdown, Lucasade, Madness, MixThis, Monty, Music X, My Way, No, No
Order, Paranoid, PH-1, Plink 2 and Power.


TFOG 008 : YET MORE 14 MODULES + PLAYER
They keep on coming!  Probably because they are so great, some
stunning tracks on here including the atmospheric Power Monger theme
tune, remember those trumpets and kettle drums?  But the track SFX is
one of the best here.  The modules are :- Power Monger, Promise,
Project X, Push It, Race, Rap Sister, Read, Rescue, Rever, Rounde,
Scoopex, SFX, Short and Silly.


TFOG 009 : ANOTHER 14 MODULES + PLAYER
The last disk for a while, but one of the best.  Again use the Pro
Tracker player to work your way through some haunting melodies
including Spooky and Slides.  The modules are :- Silver, Skyman,
Slides, Space Song, Spooky, Star Scroll, Star Worx, Stun Runner,
Super Cars, Termination Day, Treasure Trap, Trip, Tune and Undecided.


DFOG 010 : A MIXED BUNCH
Rated 72% in ST Format this disk contains some of the first ever
Falcon demos.  3DTT lets you control lots of different and FAST 3D
objects in real-time with zooming and spinning as fast as your mouse
can scurry.  WALKING BIRD is a ray traced animation which is very
nicely looped and a pleasure to look at and show friends (run it with
Audio Fun Machine active for the best effect though).  TERMINAL F**K
UP was the first real time rotating and zooming and sick inducing
demo and is still impressive now.  PARAGON DEMO (True Colour, 80
columns, interlace ON) is a nice smooth vector demo with very well
coloured objects indeed.  Finally is Pro Tracker v2.1a and three JPEG
pictures (CONAN, GIRL1 and SUNRISE), just like ST Format said, a
mixed bunch indeed!


MFOG 011 : MUSICAL DELIGHTS
Some fun and serious programs to play with.  CRAZY SOUNDS is like SAM
and it allows you to define certain samples to certain events or
keyboard entries.  Supplied with 51 different samples there will be
enough here to have your Falcon banging and smashing away for no good
reason!  DIGITAPE is a fully working demo from Trade It in Germany
and allows 20 seconds sampling time.  FORTUNE is similar in vein to
Crazy Sounds and SAM, allowing you to create sound cites like on the
Unix workstations.  PROTRACKER is the soundtracker module player as
featured everywhere.  Finally FADER is like AUDIO FUN MACHINE without
the DSP effects but with a better quality output, I use this program
when demonstrating the power of real-time music generation while
playing with Desktop, excellent with variable settings, etc...


AFOG 012 : POV PACKAGE
You can't have failed to notice this stunning package reviewed in the
popular computer press.  Rated ST Format Gold with 90% and even given
away on their cover disk this is the complete version, and its huge. 
The entire thing is packed and will need a fair chunk of hard disk
space.  The resulting 24-bit images themselves are quite large and so
is the manual should you want to get creating yourself!  Be warned
this is no easy task and with over 400K of documents and the most
unfriendly command line interface ever you will struggle at first for
sure, but please send in your own home grown results.


AFOG 013 : JPEG PICTURES
The best quality graphics on your Falcon and there are 21 different
files here for your viewing.  No viewer is supplied but we recommend
either GEM VIEW 2.3 or STUDIO PHOTO.  The pictures are ASTRONA1 a man
on the moon shot, BABY lots of cuddly toys around a baby, BIRDS
different birds that look almost airbrushed, BLADE a black and white
blade runner pic, BLUME a nice flower, BUTRFISH an excellent fishy
with detailed scales and all, CLOWNS some fun fair clowns with a kid
this image is superb, CONAN the legendary barbarian guy, DRAGON a
raytraced POV picture of a fantastic dragon standing on a glass
floor, DRAGONDR another raytraced Dragon but with wings this time,
EGYPTIAN my personal favourite picture including the pyramids,
pharaoh et all, amazing, FALLS a beautiful water fall into a canyon,
FIERY a setting sun, FISH13 more finned things, GIRL1 an unbelievable
picture of a topless girl laying on the beach (nothing exposed but
not far from it) very tastefull and VERY high quality, IONIC5 a weird
raytraced bottles affair, POOL a brilliant swimming pool complete
with inflatable dinosaur and metalic man, ROO_SIGN a smart picture of
a sign post (honest!), SANFRAN1 an excellent picture of the San
Francisco bridge and the sea crashing onto the shore, STORMY a bad
night for sure!  SUNRISE an average sun rise picture.


DFOG 014 : BSS BITS
Two compressed files, the first is the BSS demos, which contains the
stunning SPEEDER demo (RGB or 60Hz TV) that lets you fly a space ship
around this cool landscape.  PLASMA rotates an excellent picture of a
ray traced clown REALLY fast with some superb music.  INTEL displays
the Motorola Inside logo (!!!) and waves millions of colours through
it while spinning it around.  There is also the CEBIT 93 DEMO which
is quite simple but very nice indeed with stars and music and nice
pictures, shame it needs an RGB really.  More excellent value for
money here.


GFOG 015 : GRAPHICS UTILS
Various utils and programs all to do with graphics one way or
another. First is BITCAMRA which enlarges, reduces and generally
allows you to play with various images (inc GEM, IMG, STTT IMG, XIMG
and XGA).  The DML suite contains programs to view IFF, RAW, GIF and
TGA images automatically.  GEM VIEW 2.24 loads and saves nearly every
possible picture file you could think of and some you couldn't think
of too!  IFF HAM8 LOADER does exactly that, loads and displays IFF
HAM8 pictures on the Falcon.  PALETTE MASTER lets you see the superb
range of colours on the Falcon.  JPEG4A will convert GIF to JPG and
JPG to GIF format.  There is also the SPEED OF LIGHT GIF VIEWER
version 2.1 and 2.5 on here so you can load and view all manner of
GIF images on your Falcon (we find 2.5 works best).  Finally we have
included the STUDIO PHOTO demo which will load and display (no save)
and allow you to play with the stunning JPEG picture files, all sorts
of fantastic options are available including dither, zoom, reduced,
colour, etc...  great fun and a real taster for the finished thing.


UFOG 016 : TONS OF UTILS
Check out this little lot then!  BACKWARD an ST Emulator, allows you
to configure all sorts of things in order to make more ST games and
demos run on the Falcon, we found it to be very successful indeed but
it needs really playing with to get the more technie programs to run.
BOOTCONF allows you to select your video modes, etc upon boot up. 
DC SEA is the util that creates a self extracting file from any
archived file made with most popular packers, invaluable.  DESKPIC
will install any GIF image pattern onto the Desktop (plenty supplied)
but needs to run under MultiTOS and also a good knowledge of German! 
FBOOT is Mike Watsons wonderful boot sector util that allows you to
configure the caches and internal speaker, plus skip hard drive and
boot from a floppy.  FPATCH is the Atari Falcon patch program that
stops your hard drive doing things it shouldn't do!!  FS2 is a beta
test version of Falcon Screen the software screen enhancer for the
Falcon, warning can damage some monitors.  GEMBENCH runs comparision
tests between different desktop environments.  MAGIBOOT allows more
configuaration on boot-up.  MDIAL forces most programs to accept a
keyboard input for a dialogue box prompt, useful.  MEGA DEPACKER 2
will depack nearly all files from the ST and even Amiga, VERY useful
little program which even handles batch files.  MTOSS ACC ?! 
PRIORITY is for showing which programs the CPU is giving priority to
when running MultiTOS.  PROCLIST shows all currently running
processes again from MultiTOS.  SPEAKER OFF sits in your Auto folder
and turns that damn internal speaker off automatically.  Finally TT
GAMES will get Micro Proses Formula One running on a Falcon or TT and
indeed may even work on some other games too.


PFOG 017 : DSP UTILS
OK, programmers everywhere get this disk!  It contains the Brainstorm
DSP Assembler and Debugger and lots and lots and lots of example
files and support files to help you out.  There is also the
invaluable CHIPSET CPX and the Cookies CPX and PS CPX.  Finally we
have put the DCX Plus program on here so you can now depack all your
files with one program.  A real programmers treasure chest.


PFOG 018 : MICRO C
This disk contains the Micro C compiler which has been updated for
the Falcon and comes with 131K worth of documentation.  We will add
EMACS to this disk as soon as a new copy arrives.


GFOG 020 : DONGLE GAMES
Recently update this disk now contains two DongleWare games, namely
Oxyd and Spacola.  OXYD (VGA required) is a superb little rolling and
puzzle affair with you guiding this slick black marble around some
fantastically difficult mazes in order to switch the Oxyds.  The new
game, SPACOLA really is quite special.  For a start this is a space
based shoot-em-up with a nifty little rotating ship in the middle and
some sights and endless laser fire and enemies to wipe out.  The game
runs in monochrome but looks excellent and sounds even better with
quality DMA stereo samples blasting away.  This is like asteroids but
a lot more fun and a lot more harder too!!


DFOG 021 : GROTESQUE DONUGHTS
Here are some new Falcon demos for you.  First up is Omegas Grotesque
demo, an STE conversion which features some manic rave music and wild
screen effects with dancing women and cows!  Excellent stuff.  There
is also the Red Sector Intro with a nice logo, some cool music and
raster text.  This is followed by Griffs Left Donught Demo which
starts with a stunning True Colour raytraced picture and is followed
by some gouraud shaded objects backed with an excellent soundtrack. 
Finally there are two small demos called F UK Moi 1 and 2 which are
manic colour cycling affairs.


AFOG 022 : ART PACKAGES
This disk contains lots of product demos mainly of art and graphics
packages.  There is Papillion, a detailed French art editor program,
the excellent Studio Photo demo which will load and display many
different picture formats including JPEG, GIF, IFF and Photo CD plus
more, there are also manipulation tools but no save option.  Then
there is the True Paint demo, plenty of functions available and a few
sample pictures included.  We have also bundled Gemview 2.3 on here,
this is the latest version and will self-extract itself to your hard
disk by using the config program included, all docs are here both in
German and English, this is a fantastic Shareware picture convertor
and viewer.  Finally we have included Baby SE II which seems to be
some form of art package but we are not too sure!  It manages to load
pictures though but drawing on them is tricky.


AFOG 023 : FHS SHOW
Known as the FANTASY-HORROR-SEXY Show I, this is a collection of GIF
pictures along the above themes!  This disk is rated 16 and may
contain images that offend some people, but if this does not bother
you then get this disk.  There are some excellent pictures on here
including some Boris Vallejero artwork and some gruesome horror pics.
Excellent!


DFOG 024 : MIXED DEMOS
A real mixed bunch of demos on this disk but there is certainly some
interesting stuff to watch.  First is BIGSCREEN, sit back and watch
your Falcon display a screen of a resolution of 1600x600 in 16
colours!!!  Quite useless but impressive anyway.  BOUND is a little
demo that texture maps a GIF image onto a large ball and bounces it
around the screen.  COOLSONG is a fantastic module for use with
another program on this disk!  DRAGON seems to reset the machine and
then moves the Atari logo into the middle of the screen which then
zooms into you followed by a nice starfield.  ETERNITY is a small
demo from a new crew which features some nice pictures, a good
soundtrack and some interesting text to read.  FLIGHT is three small
programs that each displays a fractal and then zooms into it in real
time with 256 colours, quite impressive!  FRACTALE is another fractal
generator that allows you to speed things up by using the DSP, again
in 256 colours with zoom and flight options.  GOURAUD is a small demo
featuring real-time gouraud shaded objects flying around.  MAD is a
strange almost ball shaped thing with lots of colours and it moves
around a bit!!  MOUNTAIN is a fractal landscape generator that only
uses 16 colours but really speeds along when drawing the pictures,
plus you can also create an animation of flying down through your
fractal landscape.  MUDU is a nice module player that runs as an
application freeing you to do other things, good quality and two
modules supplied with it.  SWABS makes your Falcon desktop run at
1600x600 with 16 colours!!!  Useless because you cannot read any text
and the update is rather slow but certainly interesting to watch. 
Finally UTOPOS is a STE game that runs only just on the Falcon, it
features an Oids type landscape and two players at once, it is VERY
bugged and you should read the text file included before running it!


DFOG 025 + 026 : HUMANS ANIM
This two disk set contains a demo of the game HUMANS.  When we
originally received this demo it was badly packed and very hard to
run, well thanks to FOG we have now made it into two simple ZIP files
that will self-extract themselves onto your hard drive, and they need
at least 3 meg of space too!  The demo has NO gameplay but does
feature various animations of humans up to various amusing things,
all very colourful, some quite funny and others quite impressive, a
decentish soundtrack too.  Fun to show around but nothing to play
here.


TFOG 027 : BEST MODULES YET
Our best module disk yet with 10 of the hottest Amiga modules we
could find, all really top quality stuff and a replayer is also
included.


DFOG 028 : MORPHING BLAT
This disk contains the stunning True Colour Morphing animation, a
demo of a new art package called Chroma 24 soon to be released by
Floppyshop.  Watch as two faces melt into one another and back again,
very clever stuff indeed.  This is a self extracting file.  Also on
this disk is the excellent game BLAT which is a brilliant Tetris
variant with good DMA stereo sound and frantic and addictive
gameplay.  A very nice disk.


DFOG 029 : 680XX DEMOS
This disk is full of demos from the recent 680XX convention held in
Hamburg.  First up is the New Power Generation Dentro called PLASTIC
DREAMS which has a whole host of impressive effects including a
brilliant vector dot star tunnel and real time overscan fractals. 
Then there is a SHADED BOBS demo with some excellent music and
nothing but a whole host of patterns as theses colourful bobs zoom
around the screen.  There is another program called GFX which
displays an utterly incredabile fantasy picture on-screen.  Then
there is the LIGHT demo which has a good space picture backdrop and
puts these vector objects all over the screen which smoothly morph
one into the other, good music too.  Finally is the excellent New
Line Dentro called WHEN DREAMS BECOME REALITY which features some
excellent graphics and effects including a cube rotated in real time
with a true colour picture texture mapped onto each face - excellent
stuff indeed!


DFOG 030 : TUBULAR RAYS
Only 2 programs, but WOW!!!  The first is the amazing ray traced
animation called FUJI RAY which features a superb spotlight thing
rotating around and lighting up a Fuji logo and other things, quite
superb.  This is a huge self extracting ZIP file and requires a
display capable of 60Hz (ie RGB or new TV), it won't function on a
VGA or SVGA because they have dire problems displaying XGA images. 
The other file is TUBULAR BELLS demo, there are no graphics but a
superb rendition of Mike Oldfields classic in 16-bit Stereo and it
sounds good.
