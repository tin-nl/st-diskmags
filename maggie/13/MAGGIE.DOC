"It seems that  most  disk  magazines  ought  to  have  these funny or
philosophical quotes at the top of  each  article, now where did I put
this one ?" (R.Davey)



                                FOGGIE
              The Falcon dedicated section of Disk Maggie



Welcome Maggie readers one  and  all,  this  is  the section of Maggie
bought to you by the Falcon Owners  Group.  So what has been happening
in the world of FOG then?  Yikes, where do I start?!


INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION

Not only content with dominating the  Falcon marketplace in the United
Kingdom,the Falcon Owners Group are pleased to announce the opening of
two new sites in Sweden and  Denmark.   Each site will offer a special
bulletin board filled with  Falcon  goodies,  an  exclusive PD library
discounted for members and fast distribution of our magazine and cover
disk.

LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING!

We bring you the  only  Falcon  dedicated  magazine  in the world, but
what's more issue 3 is set to  be  the  largest ever!  We have so many
articles and news features about the  Falcon  that we are having a job
cramming it all in.  But  rest  assured  we  will be printing on time,
just look out for issue 3  coming  your  way  very soon.  If you would
like an issue of Falcon  Update  but  are  not  a member of the Falcon
Owners Group then please order now  to avoid disappointment, after all
we sold every issue we had of  #2  and  are printing more to allow for
this increase this time, but  we  still  recommend you order now.  The
price is four pounds  and  fifty  pence  sterling,  including the high
density cover disk, cheques or postal orders should be made payable to
the 'Falcon Owners Group' and sent to the FOG UK address, thank you.


GET IT RIGHT!

Please understand that the Falcon  Owners  Group  has moved house, the
new address being the PO Box in  Stafford.  Sadly though it seems that
ST Format are incapable of getting  this right!  What's more they even
reviewed Falcon Update issue 2  as  being  a  disk magazine!  Cheek of
it!!  Still they did award us a nice 85% which more than compensates I
guess.  But please note that the  FOG  UK  address is no longer 10 Oak
Drive, try Stafford instead, it  might  get  there a bit quicker then.
While we are on the subject of  FOG  in  the media, STF were also kind
enough to review Vertical Mayhem, quite a decent score too.
Well done Griff, for only a  few  hours  work you sure impressed them!
Lets just hope that your demo  does  as  well.  Yep that is right, the
Falcon Owners Group has commisioned a  demo from Martin Griffiths, AKA
Griff of Electronic Images. It  has  been  a  while in the making (due
mainly to an overdose of  University  work)  but  I feel confident you
will see something around soon.   I  will  not  give too much away now
suffice to say that  it  has  some  wonderful  8  channel stereo music
'borrowed' from the Crystal  Dreams  demo  on  the  PC and some superb
graphics.  Wait and see, we are.



IF THE FLOPPY ONES CAN DO IT

You may have obtained the latest copy of Floppyshops Falcon catalogue,
and indeed may have been  impressed  with  over 200 high density disks
worth of reportedly 'Falcon' software.  Well lets take a look then...

63 disks worth of clip art.  Basically IMG stuff from their ST range.
19 disks worth of fonts for various  DTP packages, again from their ST
range.
18 disks worth of pictures, now these are  at least JPEG or GIF so are
nice!
84 disks worth of samples and modules, again all from the ST.

Plus don't forget the 6 disks  worth  of FLI animation files, although
personally I think these are  great  so  don't hold this against them.
Other than that they have the  regular selection of Falcon games/demos
and utilities that nearly  all  PDL's  have  (and  indeed a few others
don't have, including FOG PDL).

At three pounds a disk (high density  at least!) are you getting value
for your money?  Well that  isn't  the  point  here,  it  is not up to
Floppyshop to make sure the software is of a high standard, that is up
to the programmers.  But stating they have the largest range of Falcon
software is perhaps being a bit  too  ambitious because with 184 disks
of software which can easily be obtained from just about any decent ST
PD library you are left wondering what all the fuss is about.

Anyway if you would like a  catalogue  write  to PO Box 273, Aberdeen,
AB9 8SJ or call with  your  credit  card  number  on 0224 312756.  The
service is very good, and  does  at  least reflect their prices.  They
also send out  free  printed  catalogue  updates  to regular customers
which is a nice touch (and one the  FOG PDL ought to pick up on).  But
they charge top of the range prices  and are perhaps a bit cheeky with
their statements, so next time you  purchase  from a PDL think again -
are you buying Falcon software or mere  ST  port overs made to pad out
the catalogue?  Or do you care anyway!


INTERESTED IN 'ANI'MATION ON YOUR FALCON?

Perhaps you cannot wait for Chroma Studio 24 to be released, or indeed
be able to afford the 150 pounds asking price when it does.  And maybe
you are a  little  upset  that  none  of  your  favourite  Cyber Paint
packages work on your wonderful machine.  Well panic no more!  because
if you have some of  the  old  ST  magazine  cover disks, or indeed PD
disks, see if you  can  grab  a  copy  of  ANI  ST,  that silly little
animation package that let  you  morph  alsorts  of  weird vectors and
stars into other weird objects!!  Well bung  it on your hard drive and
play away!  It will work fine on  your Falcon and with 4Meg memory you
can create some  REAL  bad  animations!!   Still  only  16  colours of
course, but fun all the same.


ELITE II : FRONTIER, A MARKETING MANS DREAM COME TRUE

You've all heard the hype, seen the adverts and read the reviews.  Yep
Elite 2 has landed on the  Atari  platform  at last and is waiting for
you to board  with  your  œ30  ticket  upon  an intergalactic journey.
Having spoken to CIH earlier  today  I  believe loyal readers may have
already encountered his extensive review of this new game, so why am I
mentioning it here  then?   Simple,  it  LOVES  the  Falcon!  Don't go
expecting any major speed increases or  options for PC style bitmapped
graphics (come ON Griff!  Get  real)  but  do  expect a damn fine game
with much smoother graphics than the  ST  and  running just as fast as
the Amiga or 386 versions.   Personally  I  was  never much 'into' the
first game, I know people whos BBC's (and indeed lives to some extent)
were devoted to the drug known  as  Elite.   Anyway  if I am back next
issue signing  myself  off  as  'Supreme  Universe  Warrior  Davey' or
something, you know for sure it got me too!


THE FOG CREEPS INTO SCOTLAND!

You may be aware that the Falcon Owners Group has two bulletin boards.
Well not any more!   We  have  gained  another  support site under the
guise of the superb DIGITAL  IMPULSE  BBS  based  in Scotland.  With a
growing Falcon file base, Falcon  related  message  echos, the FOG PDL
catalogue and links into the NeST and Fido nets (amoungst others) this
is the board to call.  All speeds up to 14,400 baud are supported (8 N
1) and it is on-line 24 hours  a  day,  so  call now on +44 (0)555 772
016.


AND THEY CAME IN ONE BY ONE

It would seem that Falcon owners are  getting more support from the PD
and Shareware world as a  new  spate  of  programs flood into our hard
drives.  I am not going to review  any  here (after all I do that once
for Falcon Update) but suffice to say  here  is  a list of some of the
better programs to travel across the bulletin boards....

BACKWARD 3.01 : 'The' latest  version  (until  next  week I expect) of
this very popular and useful ST  'emulator'  (I use that term loosely,
believe me).
ATOMIK PACKER v3.5 : Altairs superb ST  packer jiggled about a bit for
the 030.
FONTEER : Puts that 'oh so  gorgeous'  Apple  Mac font in place of the
Atari one.
SPEC2XGA : Converts all  those  Spectrum  512  piccies into lovely XGA
Images (there you go  Floppyshop  -  more  disks  to  fill  up with ST
stuff).
MASTER OF CHAOS :  Dungeon  Master  hits  the Falcon, Shareware style,
nice game!
SPECTRUM EMULATOR : Another Griff 'thing',  now runs at Spectrum speed
unlike  the ST version which couldn't quite make it!!!  Loads of games
included too.
ECOPY1_5 : Nice high density disk copiers, nuff said.

Plus of course some beautiful demos including the excellent Warum demo
by Lazer (indeed CIH  may  have  reviewed  it  here somewhere) and the
smart Crime demo by DNT (very nice one too).


AND THAT'S A WRAP

Well I consider this enough for this  issue, if you want more and even
more Falcon news/reviews/interviews and every other view you can think
of then simply send your  œ4.50p  away  NOW  for  your issue of Falcon
Update 3.  Due out in Jan/Feb 1994  it  is  the best issue yet and the
cover disk will truly blow you away!  Get it and see why.

Cheers and catch you in the next Maggie,
