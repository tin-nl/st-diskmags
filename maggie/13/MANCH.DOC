                      THE MANCHESTER ATARI SHOW
                      -------------------------

Attended by Leon O'Reilly

        There was a  time  when  Atari  dominated  computer  shows - I
remember there huge stands  in  London  shows  a  couple of years ago,
monstrous carbuncles full of STs, TTs and Lynxes. Now Atari's presence
at shows can be described as  either  'low key' or 'non-existent'. But
there are still thousands of ST owners  and there is a need for decent
ST shows.
        This most recent show was organised by Europress, and was held
in Haydock park  racecourse.  Any  analogies  with  'sad  ken' will be
ignored. It was held in mid December  in a vain attempt to capture the
Christmas market. Unfortunately the Sunday it was held on was cold and
foggy - it even started  to  snow.  Not  the  ideal conditions to lure
hundreds of punters to a show.
        There were also no signs to the show - neither on route nor at
Haydock park itself. The actual show itself took place in two rooms in
the haydock park complex.  Yes,  rooms,  not  halls,  nothing like the
sweeping expenses of Wembley conference centre or Earl's court.
        There were in all no more  than  a  dozen stands - a couple of
these being box shifters and PD libraries. The box shifters did have a
couple of Falcons for sale for considerably  less than I paid for mine
(prices have gone down about  œ200  for  the  4meg  model with a lower
capacity hard  drive).  The  PD  libraries  also  had  an  interesting
selection of Falcon software -  mainly  demos  but also some direct to
disk recording programs and lots of useful utilities.
        Falcon owners will  also  be  interested  in  the 'Falcon Fact
File'. This is a falcon user group which aims to put you in touch with
other users of this great machine.  You  simply  fill in a form noting
down what you use your Falcon for  and  what software you have and you
are put onto a database. You can  browse through this and get in touch
with other Falcon owners who have similar interests. If you are having
problems with a particular package  you  can  contact someone else who
uses it.  This  is  a  commendable  idea  run  by  two  genuine Falcon
€enthusiasts and I recommend that all Falcon owners get in touch.
        Situated next to this stand were some ST owners offering you a
replacement operating system. Going  under  the  catchy  name of SMS2,
this new o/s resides on a cartridge. It offers features such as multi-
tasking and networking but unfortunately you can't run any ST software
under it which is a bit strange.  There is some dedicated software for
it and it might be worth investigating further.
        Hisoft,   those   perennial   atari-supporting   show   goers,
inevitably had a stand. Although they spent most of their time showing
off the gimmicky  videomaster,  they  had  some  much more interesting
products on offer. Devpac 3 has lost most of its bugs and glitches and
is looking more and more like the  definitive assembler for the ST and
Falcon - it now recognises 68030 code  and  Mon runs in all the Falcon
resolutions. There was also a new  version  of Hisoft Basic out - this
supports both the Falcon  and  MultiTOS.  One  of the most interesting
products was Devpac DSP -  at  last  a  decent  assembler for the DSP.
Those of you familiar with the  Devpac environment will be immediately
at home with this program  -  you'll  just  need to learn DSP assembly
language.
        Hisoft were also selling a  new  range  of books including the
longly awaited 'The Atari Compendium'  by  Scott Sanders. This weighty
tome threatens to be the new  bible  for ST and Falcon owners stealing
the title of 'most essential book'  from ST Internals. It certainly is
the  biggest  book  on  the   market   -  comparisons  with  telephone
directories wouldn't be far out. It size  is matched by its price - it
costs the best part of forty quid. It covers all sections of operating
system - GEM freaks will revel in the  AES and VDI info, there is also
detailed information about  all  the  GEMDOS,  BIOS  and  XBIOS calls,
including the new Falcon calls.  MultiTOS/MiNT is also discussed along
with GDOS giving the book a good rounded appeal. My only criticisms of
this book  are  that  perhaps  there  isn't  enough  concentration  on
hardware addresses. I would also liked  to  see  some more info on the
Blitter, and also I don't  like  the  way  that  trap calls are listed
alphabetically not numerically. These minor  niggles aside, if you are
going to buy one book about the ST, buy this.
        Another  programming  book  that   Hisoft  were  offering  was
entitled 'Modern Atari  System  Software'.  This  is  aimed  at Falcon
€programmers and covers all areas of  the  new system - the DSP, VIDEL,
the CODEC and the new trap  calls.  Also,  there is some discussion of
MultiTOS  and  SpeedoGDOS.  This  book  assumes  that  you  have  some
knowledge of ST hardware  -  it  only  really  details the differences
between the Falcon and ST, not the things that have remained the same.
At twenty quid it may be  a  more viable option for Falcon programmers
than the Atari compendium.
        Another book they were selling  was Motorola's DSP 56000/56001
user guide. This is probably the most comprehensive reference book you
are going to get on the  chip.  It details all the instructions, which
one operate with parallel moves, instruction  times and also has a lot
of info about the pipelining  effect  and  how  the chip can interface
with microprocessors. Hisoft were  selling  this  for  a meagre twelve
pounds and I urge all Falcon programmers to buy it now!

        Perhaps the most interesting  stand  in  the  show belonged to
Titan designs. Not only were they  showing of their new video genlock,
but also Chroma Studio 24 -  the  most  eagerly awaited art package of
all time. Although  not  finished  yet,  what  I  saw  of  the package
convinced me that this is by far and away the best product yet seen on
the Falcon - this  is  the  type  of  program  that will actually sell
Falcons, it is that good. Not only does it give excellent control over
the palette (you can have  anything  up  to 24-bit colour), import and
export a multitude of file  formats  and  do  all the usual tricks you
expect from art packages, it also has  a multitude of new effects, one
of the most intriguing being  its  ability  to  morph one picture into
another. From the users point of view  this process is simple - simply
set up two pictures and some  control  lines and Chroma does the rest.
Chroma makes extensive use  of  the  DSP  -  so everything really zips
along. I really am only scratching  at  the surface of its abilities -
look out for a more detailed  review  when it is released. But believe
me, you won't need to wait for a  review  - as soon as it released buy
it - you won't be disappointed.

        Elsewhere Europress  were  selling  ST  review  -  one  of its
journalists  turned  up  in   a   rather   smart  Jaguar  T-shirt.  ST
applications was also on sale and I picked  up a copy of this. It gets
€more like ST  World  each  time  I  read  it  -  and  yes,  that  is a
complement!

        Overall the show was small  but friendly. The number attending
may have been disappointing, but all  those  there couldn't fail to be
impressed with Chroma 24 which really did  steal the show. I only hope
that it was a combination of the  time,  location and the state of the
economy that kept people away and I yearn  for a return of the days of
the great Atari shows.
