            The Seventh International Computer Show
            (Formerly the 16-bit Fair) 19th-21st Feb 1993

A CIH Exclusive report!!!

(Also formerly a good show, but all will become clearer in this 
text...)

With excitement mounting, the following were expected to make this 
the  show  of  a lifetime (Alright,  the show of the  year..)  The 
Falcon,  the latest software,  the latest hardware,  Alan,  (Hello 
there!),  The  Falcon,  Atari  to  be  showing the Falcon  and  be 
available  and useful with lots of juicy information...  The  show 
itself to be luxuriously accomodated at Wembley Conference Centre, 
and  going  into  fantasy  land,  the food and drink to  be  at  a 
reasonable price.. (Well I must have at least one little joke!)

Did it turn out like that, did it B*ll*cks!!

Expecting  rather more from the show than there was,  I booked two 
tickets, and visited both on the Friday and the Sunday..

The cast:- Myself, the author, wearing the usual 'Tall Fat person' 
disguise..    Alan  Johnstone,   wearing  the  thin  tired  person 
costume.. (Sunday:- Mark and Dave with their pink rucksack!)

Friday 19th February....

Got  up early,  Alan and I found our train,  found the show venue, 
and  then found the long and winding queue,  and this was just for 
the  advance  'Fast-lane'  tickets..  It  was very  cold,  with  a 
piercing  North-Westerly wind,  and talking of the subject  'cold' 
there  were  traces  of one given to me by  a  man  possessing  an 
incredibly  large pair of underpants at our local  computer  club, 
who shall remain nameless, but is called Gareth... The queue did a 
lot  of the standing still thing (Fire regulations  and  suchlike) 
but after half an hour or so, we were in...

THE CUT-PRICE RECESSION SPECIAL 16-Bit Show..

I remember that a previous show in 1990 (The Xmas Shopper) Managed 
to fill two halls of the Wembley venue.. The previous year had the 
16-Bit  Show  fill  one hall,  (With the help of a  big  stand  by 
Atari..) But this show was a pale shadow, and came in at a tightly 
squeezed half of a hall...  Not an impressive beginning..  Initial 
attempts  to find Atari produced a confused scene  called  'Falcon 
Feature' an unadorned stand with several Falcons which looked like 
the  entire  Research  and Development budget for  a  third  world 
country had been tipped over a market stall...

These  machines were actually the property of Compo  Software  who 
were previewing some of their Falcon products..

These  were  'Falcon Speed' the Falcon version of the  'PC  Speed' 
(The only Compo product that I actually got to play with, a 286 PC 
emulator plugging into the Falcon expansion slot which was running 
a  mono VGA version of 'Windows' although a 256 colour VGA  option 
was available..)

Also 'Musicom' a DSP audio effects and sampling package, a demo of 
a  genlock using the 15-bit 32,768 colour overlay mode,  hooked up 
to  an external video source (In this case,  a camera pointing  at 
the  audience  with  some very nice graphics  overlayed  onto  the 
picture...  Also  'Picture  Blaster',  which displayed in  several 
screen resolutions,  some of which were higher than the 'official' 
640 x 480 resolution,, (How about 800 x 608 pixels??)....

As explained before, Atari did not show themselves officially, but 
two  people,  one  of whom later recognised as Darryl  Still,  the 
Atari  marketing  manager  used the Compo stand to  speak  to  all 
interested  parties  about  the Falcon..  Using a  Public  address 
system  woefully  not up to the job,  they did reveal the  release 
dates for the proper UK launch..

!!Dah Dah!!

These  were  the  1st  March  for  a  'low-level'  launch  through 
specialist  dealers  and musical hardware suppliers,  and  a  more 
general release through 'normal distribution channels' at the  end 
of March... Fingers crossed, eh lads!!

There was also some welcome indication that they may have  dropped 
their  anti-games and elitist bias to the Falcon,  if gamesplayers 
want to buy them and then discover the rest, all well and good..

There  were  several other Falcons on the ground  here..  A  brief 
spotters guide finds them at the following:-

Hisoft,  demonstration  of  'Truepaint',  and other rolling  demos 
(More detail on them later..)

Audio-Visual Research and the inevitable Videomaster..

16-32  PDL with two on their stand...  'Fastcopy' IS compatible!!! 
The other machine was kept busy raytracing..

Brixton  Exchange  Mart,  showing  the D2D hard-drive  DSP  direct 
access  recording system,  although I only heard any really  funky 
sound from it on the Sunday..

Gasteiner had prices posted on their stand,  at a painful œ549 for 
a  basic 1MB machine..  It is not known whether they actually  had 
any  on  sale,  or were merely taking advance orders...  None were 
actually to hand..

Other Falcon-related items from the show...

Several  people were veritable mines of information,  none more so 
than Brad Koda of Best Electronics (Atari spare parts man from San 
Jose,  California)  who had a very well-thumbed copy of the Falcon 
internal  specs on his stand held there by a very strong piece  of 
red hairy string (We tried!) Amongst other not easy to  understand 
things,  it revealed the DSP chip to have a processing speed of 16 
MIPS  and a data throughput of 1 Megabyte per  second!!  Commodore 
Custom chips,  hahahahahahaah!  Also that Atari could have stopped 
manufacturing  the  STE,  but  it  has an  'undead'  afterlife  as 
defective returned machines are 'recycled'.. There are still STFMs 
coming out that way apparently..

Atari   have  definitely  stopped  manufacturing  peripherals   to 
concentrate  on their core business (Presently the  Falcon)  which 
probably  explains part of the tendency for the Falcon to  feature 
sensible industry-standard connectors and ports..  Also that Atari 
have  suffered from the losses incurred over the last  few  years, 
and  like  the early days of the ST,  it looks like the Falcon  is 
truly  a make or break situation for them...  (A view expressed by 
Hisoft as well..)

The  Falcon will have its American release in mid-March  but  they 
will get a version with a detachable keyboard (Based on the  Mega-
STE?) whilst the UK market will get the 'old' 1040 case..„Wrong!!€

The Falcon Soundchip (Yamaha YM2149) compatibility bug  may   well 
have been fixed??„Nope!!€

More  information  on the infamous 'September' promise  as  well.. 
There  was  the  intention to release for  that  time,  but  early 
machines did not come up to scratch, a case of 'oops sorry..'
(The  story that early batches of production Falcons  were  junked 
because of faulty test equipment seem to be getting stronger..)

A  note  on the ST-Book portable ST..  This has not been  produced 
yet,  although  all the components are at their place of  intended 
manufacture,  who happened to give the lowest tender for the job.. 
The  person  owning the factory,  somewhere in the Far  East  then 
inconsiderately  wanted more money,  so a stand-off situation with 
Atari exists at the moment..

Will it be different this time? One encouraging sign was that most 
of  the  machines  on display were  English  keyboard/English  TOS 
models,  which would suggest that official UK models are available 
at last..

More on Hisoft....

Hisoft  easily had the most professional and best organised  stand 
and therefore looked quite out of place at this show...  They were 
showing  a  complete  version of 'Truepaint' the  new  Falcon  art 
package and several running demos on another Falcon connected to a 
Display-screen TV..

These were mainly several static true-colour pictures, several 256 
colour  animated sequences,  probably 'borrowed' from the PC,  not 
too impressive on their own, but more impressive by running two of 
these  alongside each other without slowing down at all..  A  more 
detailed  Atari  France  demo  featuring a  walking  bird  with  a 
soundtrack of soulful saxaphones (read off the hard drive?) and  a 
"Video" of Whitney Houstons 'Success' chart hit with images  taken 
from  the  original  video and sprayed around the  screen  to  the 
accompaniment of the entire song.. It was admitted to me that this 
barely touched the Falcons potential and was put together  quickly 
for this show..

Hisoft  clearly  have  invested a lot of time  and  money  in  the 
Falcon,  fully believe in its potential, and want to give it every 
chance..

Visiting  the Brixton Exchange stand I did a very silly thing..  I 
ordered  a Falcon from them....  Let's see if it gets there  sooner 
and not later..

They  are  one  of the early recipients to be,  and whilst  I  was 
asking, other people were asking about the Falcon with the D2D H/D 
recording system,  the general level of interest at all the stands 
was pretty high, the Atari spokespeople drawing particularly large 
crowds, maybe they expected to see rather more from them??

The scene at 16/32...

A  huge  swelling disorganised mass of people all  trying  to  get 
closer to the centre of the stand,  a brain-dead lifeless NICK (Mr 
proprieter)  wavering  about  the place trying  to  please  72,000 
people simultaneously and failing miserably... These were the only 
PD people to show up for the ST and Amiga,  and by God it showed!! 
It did not help that two of the Falcons in the show were living on 
this  already  dangerously overcrowded stand,  with the far  right 
hand corner given over to "Interesting" people..

Such as Griff of Electronic Images who is to debut a Falcon module 
player  using  a  new DSP-based technique  (With  some  help  from 
Douglas of the Pixel Twins!!?!?!?) Also Count Zero and the Dynamic 
Duo  showed  up,  although we only caught a glimpse of  Griff  and 
nothing of the others..  The TT corner was represented by Austrian 
Yat  Sui  showing several Cyber-type animations,  only these  were 
with   more   colours  and  better  resolution   than   their   ST 
equivalents..

We  left several disks with Nick and moved rather smartly  in  the 
opposite direction....

                Nothing to do with the show but...

The  Pixel Twins to release a Falcon demo for the  Hannover  Cebit 
'93  show at the end of March...  They are keeping precise details 
close  to their chests,  but it is thought to feature 3-D  texture 
mapping and fast fractal landscape generation, all in the enhanced 
Falcon resolutions..„Itsortofhappened,butnotaMegademo..€

We indulged ourselves on the 'Spring-in-a-cupboard simulator ride, 
one  of the better ones of its type....  Other people who featured 
today  were  Felice  (Richard) and Dave 'Pixie'  Hodges  who  both 
provide  colour and interest for the local computer club in  their 
own respective ways...

Other things about the show apart from the Falcon:-

Well we have to save something for Sunday...

We did attempt to try out a pre-selected range of software on  one 
of the show Falcons, the developers were reasonable and polite but 
could only expect to get anywhere much later on, IE, when the show 
was closing and it was quieter..so..

Having done enough for that day, Alan and I left soon after..

The  funny  story  surrounding my  transport  arrangements,  there 
wasn't one today, that will have to wait to Sunday!!

Sunday 21st February....

After  reviving a lifeless Alan at an unreasonably early hour,  it 
was time to make our way to Bedford Station where we were to  meet 
Dave and Mark of previous shows fame and make our way to London..

First  disaster  was only a mini-model,  trying to  replenish  our 
funds  we  found the centre of Rushden closed for  roadworks,  'Oh 
shit!'  we thought and headed for Bedford where we were  lucky  to 
find the bank we wanted, and also remembering the convoluted route 
to the station..

Passed without incident until London Transport lent a hand,  where 
the guard on the underground (Metropolitan line) told everybody on 
the  train that we would not be stopping at Wembley Park,  and two 
other  stations whilst closing the doors simultaneously....  Yours 
truly,  the writer of this piece was the only person to get out in 
time,  the  doors  hissed shut just nanoseconds later,  the others 
were  left  open-mouthed as the train pulled out of  the  station, 
whisked away to an uncertain and useless destination..

(Mark  and  Dave note:- I don't care if I've overdone  the  heroic 
quality of the last paragraph.. I got out and you didn't!!)

By  the time we met up again,  it was time for some more  ice-cold 
winds,  this  time the queue was non-existent and we were straight 
in, which just goes to show how unpredictable computer shows are..

Everything was as we left it on Friday, although the people looked 
even  more tired than before...  All the Falcon stuff has  already 
been detailed, so onto some other bits of the show.. 

Box-shifters,  yes there were lots of them,  the usual "Three ST's 
or  Amiga's  for a fiver" offers were thick in the air,  Mark  and 
Dave  were  in a total 'Egyptian looking for a really  good  deal' 
mode and set out to do some serious shopping...  Certainly,  apart 
from  a relative lowness of PC stuff (what a change!)  there  were 
bargains  for the careful shopper,  and in this respect,  the show 
begins to resemble the low-end quarter of the old-style  'Computer 
Shopper' Show before it went 'Corporate' and boring..

A  lot of blank disks,  cheap ex-cover disks,  and a Tape-streamer 
and  16-bit PC soundcard later,  they were all spent and  gasping, 
when  we  set  off to meet one of Alan's  Contacts  Glyn,  a  pre-
arranged  meeting,  and the first successful meeting at a show for 
some  time....  We  sat on the balcony at the top of the hall  and 
looked  down on to the show,  gaped at the huge empty space  which 
was the other half of the hall...

(And  I'm  not going to let their purchase of a  Super-NES  light-
bazooka  go  unremarked,  there were severe  credibility  problems 
transporting  it  back through the more street-credible  parts  of 
London, but we got out with the pink rucksack unscathed!)

Food and drink note:- Dodgy, coke at 80p per can, food for a small 
mortgage,  as is usual...  We starved it out until the Burger king 
on Tottenham Court road..

Marpet  Developments  were showing their new range of  RAM  boards 
which  expand  the ST beyond the 4MB address limit,  8MB and other
boards will be made available over the next few months..

Their Falcon memory upgrade has been put on hold until the machine 
is  properly launched,  expect to start seeing them about a  month 
after that takes place..„StillnothingfromMarpetyet..€

Other,  other  things,  a  brisk(ish)  trade in  A1200's  although 
nothing was being shown for it... Power Computing, Atari Workshop, 
Microdeal  and  Rombo  were  there,  but nothing to  tell  on  any 
significant new products from them..  There was a sizeable console 
presence,  Roland  and their state-of-the-art expensive gear  were 
there,  combined with the Brixton Exchange people, the contents of 
their  stands  were  worth  more than the rest  of  the  show  put 
together..

Acorn  had a smallish but smart stand,  and were demo-ing  several 
games including 'lotus Turbo Esprit' for the Archimedes.. 

Also seen somewhere to the left of the hall,  a running version of 
the  CD-ROM  game 'Seven Guests' on the PC which looked  slow  and 
juddery..

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Rumour-Mongering and another thing~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A reason for that big empty space in the hall?

Thalion  Software  were  to show here,  with a huge  stand  booked 
featuring  a  real  aeroplane (Type unknown but  I  assume  it  is 
smaller  than an A320 Airbus..) some motorcycles (in aid of  their 
latest  sim 'No Second Prize?') And even some computers..  On  the 
eve of the show,  the organisers were somewhat concerned that none 
of  this  had turned up.  A call to the German office  of  Thalion 
produced the response "We cancelled it, has no-one told you?"..

The other more reliable story was given to me by a boxshifter  who 
managed  to turn over more ST software at that show,  than for the 
whole   previous  year,   including  two  other  shows  that  they 
attended..  They  ran  out in no time at all,  a large-scale shelf 
raiding expedition desperately sought into the dustier corners  of 
their stock cupboards to keep the demand satisfied. It seems a lot 
of  Atari-using  folk  were there with  money  to  spend,  perhaps 
expecting to see a proper presence by Atari????

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nick of 16/32 PDL looked even more harassed and dead,  but told me 
he  was selling Falcons,  and had already sold several official UK 
machines to interested parties..

16/32 Can be contacted at 173 High Street, Strood, Kent ME2 2TW..

We  struggled  away  some  time later,  laden down  with  tons  of 
purchases..

People:-  Included both Dale from the club,  and Gareth (Underpant 
man!!)  Also  met Eddie Bryan of the Happening Boiz on  the  train 
going  out  of  Wembley who asked,  "Is that Chris Holland  of  HP 
Source??" in a Beadle-esque surprised fashion, Oh what it is to be 
very slightly famous..  Don't get an Amiga Eddie,  although the ST 
is dying, the Amiga will follow soon!! Save up for a Falcon!!

Overall then, a disappointing show from the point of view of great 
expectations,  Atari  only put in a very cut price appearance (And 
not  on  the  Sunday,  so it was a good job I went  on  Friday  as 
well..) The general standard of the show was very cheap and tacky, 
this  may well be a direct consequence of the recession,  and also 
of  competing  shows,  as two major consumer  entertainment  shows 
(Future Entertainment and Gamesmaster Live) took place in the pre-
Xmas period, this has now become one of the second-tier events..

However,  if you digged deeply enough,  there certainly was enough 
of interest on the Falcon to keep it from being a total disaster.. 
A  first  impression and early exit would not have done  for  this 
occasion,  a  longer  stay and a chat is the only way to find  out 
more..

The Falcon IS coming! (I hope..)
