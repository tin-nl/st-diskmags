                    The Overlanders Proudly Present

                   T h e    V e n t u r a     D e m o 

(Or they would if they were here, but they're not, so it's down to 
me as usual - CIH...)

Boldly  repudiating rumours of their deadness,  the Froggy masters 
of  code once more do their thang,  a whole two disks worth,  this 
time,  and  no  disk-filling rubbish,  like in the European Demos, 
either...

The  Beginning Bit:- (Or the intro,  to non-Latin types) The story 
of  a bloke,  a big bloke who has his face on a credit-card  sized 
computer  ID  thingy,  you put the card in the machine,  his  head 
spins round... Having found what he wants, he strides purposely to 
his  flying  car,and  with  the help of  his  folding  legs,  gets 
inside.. A quick take-off, warp into a starfield, and a new planet 
later...  He beams down to the surface,  and in the most one-sided 
gunfight  in  history shoots his man dead whilst the  opponent  is 
still at the hand twitching around the holster stage..

(Rule one of Intergalactic Mercenary Space-Gunfighting  therefore, 
is pick a brainless plank with nil survival prospects to shoot!)

A  lovely  piccy  then fades in using one  of  half-a-dozen  novel 
'drawing-in'  techniques,  a  very nice effect,  and you have  the 
title  picture..  All  this  time there is some  original  rousing 
soundchip music playing.. Press space again, another novel pattern 
dissolve takes over, and you are into...

The  Loader:- An X-BIOS MEN special,  a starfield,  large rotating 
central Bob-text/sector counter, other small text telling you what 
is  on  the forthcoming screen,  an isometric dot-scroller at  the 
bottom, and a module (As you might expect) playing away.. Once the 
spacebar is pressed, a large colourful 'Decrunching' logo appears, 
fading  left to right as the demo screen is depacked..

Main  Menu:-  Has everybody who has got this demo worked  out  how 
deceptive this is, if so, how long did it take you??

It  certainly  LOOKS like a game style main menu,  with  a  creepy 
CRYPTIC  style,  some very well drawn,  and quite large pseudo 3-D 
animated sprites strut their stuff,  BUT YOU CANNOT CONTROL THEM.. 
For  those  reviewers in ST-Format still trying to  get  off  this 
screen,  you move the mouse up and down, and take note of what the 
little  scroller at the top of the screen is doing..  Then press a 
button to load a screen you may like to visit!!

The Rocky-Horror type visuals were done for a never finished game, 
and  are certainly a 100% improvement over the European Demo  main 
menu effort..

1.  The Rapidomax:- A confusing mish-mash of many parts fullscreen 
demo screen,  originally intended for the European Demos,  but not 
debugged  in time,  multiple selection of Mad Max soundchip  music 
(recent  stuff) downwardly scrolling fullscreen gold rasters,  two 
monitor  screens  with different types of indicator bars  for  the 
music, a large bouncy scrolltext..

2.  Blasting  Bobs:-  An  old screen for a never  released  German 
production,  a  bottom border scroller with an old-type 'OVR' logo 
and  a sineous bob-form text scroller,  with later 3-D  bob-vector 
shapes... Quite smooth bobs, but the reflecting watery layer below 
is sorely missed in these type of screens..

3.  Spectrum Showpic:- A compulsory item on any recent French Demo 
featuring  several of Mr Bee's masterpieces..  These are  actually 
16-colour  pictures with added extras,  such as raster colours and 
use  a  lot of Cyberpaint type texture effects,  some small  'OVR' 
sprites  whizz  around the screen,  and some nice digi-drum  music 
plays..  Many  of the pictures use a time-honoured fantasy or film 
themes..

4.   The  Grid:-  Another  X-Bios  contribution,   starts  with  a 
fullscreen grid pieces of which peel away to reveal the text  "The 
Overlanders  from  the  Union.." Written in a font  last  seen  on 
'Punish  Your Machine'..  A tentative tickle of the Spacebar takes 
you  to  the second part,  with another fullscreen grid,  a module 
playing (Amiga-type tune) a large ugly 'XBM' lettering font flying 
around the screen,  various little mouse trails (my description of 
them..) going around the screen,  and 'Overlanders' sineous sprite 
chain,  and  a bottom border scroller...  Lots of things going on, 
and  soundtracker music too...  Another fairly ugly screen of  the 
'1001 things to do with your spare processor time..' School..

5.  Oniric  Saga:- Strange little intro screen,  with lots of bas-
relief effect stuff,  and a stone-effect CND logo, and an OVR logo 
on  top,  it  plays the 'Archipelagos' music by David  Whittaker.. 
Hitting  enter  takes  you to a screen with two  scrollers  and  a 
starfield in the middle of the screen, and a distorting 'OVR' logo 
at  the  bottom..  Produced by a Grafix man so no really  stunning 
effects here..

6. Hystanders:- A Hysteria/OVR co-production featuring a very full 
screen  indeed of 448 x 300 pixels,  the original screen drawn  in 
mono  mode,  now  in  low-res  colour  (You  have  to  adjust  the 
horizontal  pitch  control  on your monitor to  see  all  of  this 
screen!) This  then bounced up and down,  with a scrolltext in the 
'middle' where the picture joins with itself, or 'wraps'.. Hitting 
space  takes you to another starfield,  in the centre of which  is 
one  of  those sliding-block puzzles with jumbled  letters,  which 
move  by themselves to create the text on this final part  of  the 
demo..

7. Evil:- This screen is very much a clone of a screen produced by 
Hotline for the Inner Circle Decade Demo (Thanks for pointing this 
out  Mark!!) A large grinning skull dominates the centre,  with  a 
bottom  'Evil' logo-text,  which is prone to shimmery  illuminated 
spells..  In  the  centre,  there is a scrolling dot-text which is 
prone  to  fancy  'Wild-Copper' type  effects..  The  whole  thing 
rounded off by Digidrum music..

8.  Board  and Sphere:- A damned good guest screen by NAOS  Starts 
with  another  of those superbly drawn logos,  purple on  a  white 
background..  Then  a  fullscreen and constantly  colour  changing 
chequerboard scrolling surface scrolls by. Two rotating vector-dot 
globes  bounce  around  on this landscape,  they rotate in  a  3-D 
fashion  around  the  screen..   A  rastery  vertically  scrolling 
background  also  features..  It is possible to summon  a  heavily 
squashed 'NAOS' logo in the top border on some (Older) ST's...  An 
excellent screen.. If this had been around two or three years ago, 
NAOS would have wiped the floor with a lot of other groups at that 
time..

9. Bless Dis Mess:- ST Connexion live!!! (Well sort of..) This was 
put  together  an  incredibly long time ago (Nov  1990?)  and  was 
intended  as a main menu for a megademo of the same name..  Starts 
with  a very classy Elizabethan intro with 'Greensleeves'  on  the 
soundtracker..  A little costumed mouse stands by..  Hitting space 
produces  an authentic thump and the screen jumps and 'Hit  Space' 
(Again) is stamped onto the screen. Hitting space again reveals an 
update  to this screen,  with a picture of a robot basking in  the 
sun of an alien planet, and a dedication to Isaac Asimov (Who died 
sometime  after Nov. 1990). A very large gold multishaded metallic 
effect  scroller appears,  in the centre of the screen with a much 
smaller  silver effect barrel scroller at the top and there  is  a 
very well worn module by Scoopex,  the Amiga people..  You gasp in 
awe  at the standard of production,  and wait vainly for something 
else to happen (it does not..)

10.  The Ultimate Dist:- Certainly that..  Starts with a 'Pulsion' 
nicely-drawn  'Severed  hand  pressed into service  as  a  candle' 
logo..  What  follows is some of the most mindboggling  fullscreen 
distortion  yet seen,  with fullscreen rippling texture with vomit 
bubbles  in  Fairy  liquid to produce that  thrilling  yet  queasy 
effect..  This  is  all realtime,  so a programming as well as  an 
aesthetic  achievement..  Some  very wide and fast  variations  in 
movement.. 

(Second  part..) Some nice variations on the shaded bob  theme,  a 
notorious 'Seen one,  seen them all' theme..  These ones are user-
controllable   or  F-Key  pattern   selectable   multi-psychedelic 
coloured bobs with very many of them on the screen at one time..

(Final  Part..)  a small centre picture of a girl  and  her  long-
haired  cat,  and  a few other things blending into each other  to 
finish..)

11.  The  Greetings:-  A classic OVR screen...  A looping,  but not 
easy  to tell where,  gentle mellow sampled tune,  'borrowed' from 
Tears  For  Fears  (I'm sure they won't mind)  Which  sounds  like 
something  done in the 'Froggies over the Fence' preview  Dentro.. 
An almost full screen distorting pattern (Loads of little coloured 
balls, using a nice subtle part of the palette) and a huge, entire 
width  of the screen,  scroller...  This gives way to the greeting 
proper with some text in a very classy font,  with an alphabetical 
list  of  crews,  which for greetings,  does not become tedious or 
overlong..

If I were to sum up this screen, it would be "Just about the right 
amount of Everything.."

12.  The Reset Demo:- The end is near!!  Very much in the style of 
an  A.N.Cool  style 'M-Demo' screen with  a  positive  'go,get-em' 
soundtrack, which stylistically resembles that well-known A.N.Cool 
tune  'The President has been shot'.  The screen consists of 'OVR' 
logos,  and later, other objects on an LED effect background which 
rotate around,and a bottom LED scrolltext..

Ratings:-

Graphix:-  90%  -  Mixture of different styles,  and a  very  high 
standard  of  production..  A  quality piece of work  by  OVR  and 
friends  with  no untidy bits or naff  screens..  Impressive  main 
menu, now if this WAS developed into a game....

Sonix:-  88%  -  I liked the soundchip music on this,  as  it  was 
mostly original,  the modules were definitely not!  The Soundtrack 
on  the  Greetings screen (Excellent use of looped sample)  was  a 
delight..

Gee-Whiz:-  85% - As the ST (STFM at least) nears the end of  it's 
useful  life,  and  all  innovation has been milked dry  over  the 
years,  it  gets  harder  to impress in this  category...OVR  have 
sensibly  gone for an approach (On their newer screens)  of  taste 
and understatement and making it all look effortless,  this can be 
seen to good effect on the Greetings screen.. Some excellent guest 
screens from NAOS and Pulsion also..

Overall:- 88% - Possibly one of the last major demos on the ST,  a 
good  one  to  remember it by,  (Let's see what  Delta  Force  are 
planning, it has been over a year since 'Punish Your Machine' came 
out.. Their last ST megademo is out soon??)
