                            By  Thalion

                              Preview


In  what was generally a bleak(ish) period for ST games,  see  how 
FEW  reviews  there are this time round and then consider  a  good 
look at Thalion's new release 'No Second Prize'..

This  game  is one of those classics with a very  long  production 
history,  a group of German Coders came together in 1989, and soon 
after,  amongst other things, preliminary 3-D routines were shown, 
the new game 'No Second Prize..'

The now defunct 'ACE' magazine even featured a screenshot of  this 
wonderful game in February 1990,  it looked very different then, a 
sort of 3-D 'space race' type game where you zipped about at  will 
on  the  planets  surface..  Then all of a  sudden,  nothing  much 
happened..

This  state of nothingness continued for three years,  other games 
came  and went,  Thalion went into a shell,  apparently perfecting 
and tweaking their code in monastic isolation,  eventually, 'Trex-
Warrior'  emerged,  a  very pretty and impressive  futuristic  3-D 
blaster,  'A320  Airbus' the first Thalion Simulation and  finally 
'No Second Prize' which now looked very different..

It had become a very firmly terrestrial Motor-Cycle racer sim, and 
this is where we cut to the main part of the preview..

         ( T h e   G u t s   o f   T h e   T h i n g . . . )

A  menu  screen which lets you get at various  things  like  track 
information,  statistics,  and driver selection menu.. A soundchip 
tune plays, this is of a nice-tune-but-nothing-technically-amazing 
school of soundchip composition..

Driver  select gets you a choice of 6 distinct  personalities  and 
nationalities,  some  of which female (No sexism here..) All  have 
different styles of handling their bikes,  and different strengths 
and weaknesses,  One rider will have better cornering ability than 
another, but may be less resistant to damage/injury, (To give just 
one example..)

You  are then able to select a track of your choice (Assuming  you 
have  selected training mode,  and have not started a season,) and 
you  can display a minature overhead view of each track  and  find 
out about it's particular hazards.  Moving on,  you can adjust the 
handling  characteristics of the bike,  the usual auto/manual gear 
option,  a  useful  mouse sensitivity setting,  then it is time to 
race..

(The Graphics:-) These are some of the most incredibly smooth  3-D 
polygons  this  side of a Falcon,  a frame rate very close  to  50 
frames  per second achieved,  this is at the cost of some  detail, 
the  polygonal shapes tend to be fairly simplistic as far  as  the 
background scenery is concerned,  but in a racing sim,  these tend 
to  be  limited  to  things  like  grandstand  buildings,   trees, 
advertising  hoardings  at  the track-side,  some  other  squarish 
buildings,  etc.. The other bikes are reasonably convincing within 
the limitations of the 16-colour 'All unecessary detail sacrificed 
for  speed'  format,  there is even an overhead helicopter  flying 
above the race leaders at the start of the race..

Where  the payoff is in the incredibly smooth and  fluid  movement 
and control,  the illusion is substained by allowing the player to 
lean  into  sharp bends just like that bloke with loads  of  metal 
pins in his legs,  er,  Barry Sheen.. Control by the mouse, and is 
very responsive..

Sound  is  extremely  functional to say  the  least,  a  soundchip 
'speed-whine' soundchip 'skid' etc..

In comparison, a good competitor to 'Vroom', and urinates all over 
'Team Suzuki', less complex than 'Microprose Grand Prix..'

Availability,  officially  due out soon in the UK,  already out in 
Germany  at  least,  and  probably  a part of a  lot  of  people's 
collections already if you kno wot i mean.. Meanwhile, I have only 
reviewed  a  demo version which is not 100% complete but  gives  a 
good idea of what to expect..

Overall:-  definitely worth a look for the pure  speed  enthusiast 
who is not too bothered about the background simulation and  race-
organising  bits  which only get in the way of  the  action  after 
all..

(It  may  be of interest to some people,  'Mad Max' was sacked  by 
Thalion  some time ago,  he was too lazy for them!!!  Which is why 
you don't see any music made by him on Thalion games anymore..)
