Q. What is the Atari Jaguar?

A. The world's first 64-bit home console video game system.  Developed after
   three years of research, manufactured by IBM, the Jaguar offers high-speed
   action, spectacular graphic effects, and CD-quality sound for $250.

==============================================================================

Q. How does IBM fit into this?

A. IBM has a $500 million contract with Atari Corp. to assemble, test,
   package, and distribute Jaguar units.  Manufacturing is done at IBM's
€   Charlotte, NC facility, and the Jaguar is IBM's first attempt at producing
   a consumer grade product for an outside vendor.

   IBM has no known participation in the design of the Jaguar.  IBM has no
   plans to create games for the Jaguar.

==============================================================================

Q. Okay, who did designed the Jaguar?

A. Details are murky.  Atari claims that the Jaguar took over three years to
   develop, and was released because work was progressing faster than
   expected.  Seeing an opportunity to leapfrog the new systems from Nintendo
   and Sega, they decided to bring the machine to light.

   The Jaguar chipset is reportedly co-developed by Flare, a British company
   with ties to Atari, according to Jez San of Argonaut Software.  The
|  proprietary chips are manufactured by Toshiba and Motorola.

==============================================================================

Q. What are the specifications of the Jaguar?

A. Physical dimensions:

|      Size: 9.5" x 10" x 2"
   Controls: Power on/off
|   Display: Resolution up to 800 x 576 pixels (1300+ with additional
|              hardware)
|            24-bit "True Color" display with 16,777,216 colors
               simultaneously
|            Multiple-resolution, multiple-color depth objects (monochrome,
|              2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit) can be used
|              simultaneously
|     Ports: Cartridge slot/expansion port (32 bits)
|            RF video output
|            Video edge connector (video/audio output)
|              (supports NTSC and PAL; provides S-Video, Composite, RGB
|              outputs, accessible by optional add-on connector)
             Two controller ports
|            Digital Signal Processor port (includes high-speed synchronous
|              serial input/output)
Controllers: Eight-directional joypad
|            Size 6.25" x 5" x 1.6", cord 7 feet
             Three fire buttons (A, B, C)
             Pause and Option buttons
             12-key keypad (accepts game-specific overlays)

  The Jaguar has five processors, which are contained in three chips.  Two of
  the chips are proprietary designs, nicknamed "Tom" and "Jerry".  The third
  chip is a standard Motorola 68000 used as a coprocessor.  Tom and Jerry are
  built using an 0.5 micron silicon process.

  - "Tom"
€    - 750,000 transistors, 208 pins
    - Graphics Processing Unit (processor #1)
|     - 32-bit RISC architecture (32/64 processor)
|       - 64 registers of 32 bits wide
|       - Has access to all 64 bits of the system bus
|       - Can read 64 bits of data in one instruction
      - Rated at 26.6 MIPS (million instructions per second)
|     - Runs at 26.6 MHz
      - 4K bytes of zero wait-state internal SRAM
      - Performs a wide range of high-speed graphic effects
      - Programmable
    - Object processor (processor #2)
      - 64-bit RISC architecture
      - Programmable processor that can act as a variety of different video
        architectures, such as a sprite engine, a pixel-mapped display, a
        character-mapped system, and others.
    - Blitter (processor #3)
      - 64 bits
      - Performs high-speed logical operations
      - Hardware support for Z-buffering and Goudraud shading
    - DRAM memory controller
|     - 64 bits
      - Accesses the DRAM directly

  - "Jerry"
    - 600,000 transistors, 144 pins
    - Digital Signal Processor (processor #4)
|     - 32 bits (32-bit registers)
      - Rated at 26.6 MIPS (million instructions per second)
|     - Runs at 26.6 MHz
|     - Same RISC core as the Graphics Processing Unit
      - 8K bytes of zero wait-state internal SRAM
|     - CD-quality sound (16-bit stereo)
|       - Number of sound channels limited by software
      - Full stereo capabilities
      - Wavetable synthesis, FM synthesis, FM Sample synthesis, and AM
        synthesis
    - A clock control block, incorporating timers, and a UART
    - Joystick control

  - Motorola 68000 (processor #5)
    - Rated at 13.3MHz
    - General purpose control processor

   Communication is performed with a high speed 64-bit data bus, rated at
|  106.4 megabytes/second.  The 68000 is only able to access 16 bits of this
|  bus at a time.

   The Jaguar contains two megabytes (16 megabits) of fast page-mode DRAM.
   Game cartridges can support up to six megabytes (48 megabits) of
|  uncompressed or compressed information.  The Jaguar uses 24-bit
|  addressing, and is reportedly capable of accessing data as follows:
|
|          Six megabytes cartridge ROM
€|          Eight megabytes DRAM
|          Two megabytes miscellaneous/expansion
|
   Compressed cartridge data can be uncompressed in real-time, and can store
   the equivalent to almost 50 megabytes (400 megabits).  Compression is
   performed with JagPEG, an enhanced JPEG image decompression mechanism.

   Other Jaguar features:
   - Support for ComLynx I/O for communications with the Atari Lynx hand-held
|      game system and networked multiconsole games (on DSP port, accessible
|      by optional add-on connector)
   - The two controller ports can be expanded to support "dozens" of
     controllers
     - Digital and analog interfaces
     - Keyboards, mice, and light guns are possible
   - Expansion port allows connection to cable TV and other networks
   - Digital Signal Processor port allows connection to modems and digital
     audio peripherals (such as DAT players)
|  - One megabyte per second serial interface
|  - 9600 baud, RS-232 serial port (accessible with optional interface)

==============================================================================
|
Q. Is the Jaguar really a 64-bit system?
|
A. The question is hard to resolve, largely because the definition of what
|  constitutes an "N-bit" system has not been set.  Of the five processors in
|  the Jaguar, only the object processor and the blitter are "true" 64-bit
|  components.  Because the blitter and the object processor are in the Tom
|  chip, by extension Tom is a 64-bit chip.  The Jaguar also uses a 64-bit
|  memory architecture, according to Jez San of Argonaut Software.
|
|  Some say the Jaguar should be considered a 32-bit system, as that is the
|  maximum register size in the programmable processors (the 68000, the
|  graphics processor, and the DMA sound processor.  Others say the Jaguar
|  can be considered a 64-bit system, because 64-bit components are used, and
|  the GPU can access 64 bits of data if required.  Again, the lack of an
|  agreed-upon definition serves to complicate the issue.
|
|  For the record, the opinion of most third party developers and observers
|  is that the Jaguar is indeed a 64-bit system.
|
==============================================================================

Q. How can a graphics processor be the CPU?

A. The 64-bit custom graphics chip is a good general purpose RISC unit, but it
   has been optimized for graphics work.  As Rob Nicholson of Handmade
   Software says, "There is no primary processor in the Jaguar.  It's up to
   _me_ which I decide to use depending on the task."

==============================================================================

Q. What kind of special effects can the Jaguar do?
€
A. The Jaguar is capable of doing the following visual effects:

|  - High-speed scrolling (Object Processor).
|  - Texture mapping on two- and three-dimensional objects (Tom/Blitter).
|  - Morphing one object into another object (Tom).
|  - Scaling, rotation, distortion, and skewing of sprites and images
|      (Object Processor).
|  - Lighting and shading from single and multiple light sources (Tom and
|      Blitter).
|  - Transparency (Object Processor).
   - "Rendering" up to 850 million one-bit pixels/second (35 million 24-bit
       pixels/second, 26 million 32-bit pixels/second), or 50 million Goroud
       shaded pixels/second.  "Rendering" is believed to mean transferring a
       pixel from a frame buffer to the screen.
   - Sprites of "unlimited" size and quantity.  Realistically, sprites can be
       over 1,000 pixels wide/tall, and the number of sprites allowed is
       limited by processor cycles instead of a fixed value in hardware
|      (Object processor).
   - Programmable screen resolutions, from 160 to 800 pixels per line.  The
|      resolution can be increased even further with additional hardware up to
|      a reported 1350 pixels per line.

==============================================================================

Q. How come the Jaguar claims to have "32-bit" graphics, when 16 million
   colors only need 24 bits for rendering?

A. The additional 8-bits is for programmers to implement whatever visual
|  effects may be desired.  Examples cited include Z-buffering (for polygon
|  graphics) and an alpha channel (for transparency).

==============================================================================

Q. Okay, get to the meat -- which is better, the Jaguar or the 3DO?

A. Ye Gods, the eternal question.  The popular consensus is that the biggest
   strength of the Jaguar is that it deliveres performance comparable to the
   3DO for a lower price ($250 Jaguar vs. $500-$700 3DO units).  The same
   consensus say the biggest strength of the 3DO is the corporate strength
   behind it: over 300 developers, a consortium of multibillion dollar
   companies, more reliable advertising and promotion, etc.  Whether or not
   this makes the games or the machines any better is (hotly) debatable.

   Best bet, as always, is to try the two machines, see what games you like,
   which system offers them, then decide.

==============================================================================

Q. What's the information on the CD-ROM drive?

A. A double-speed CD-ROM drive has been announced for release in 1994, with an
   estimated price of $200.  It is reported that the CD-ROM drive is capable
   of transferring data continuously at 350K per second, or run at normal
€   audio rates of 175K per second.  Storage on a disc is expected to be around
   700 megabytes (5,600 megabits).  The CD-ROM drive plugs into the Jaguar's
   cartridge slot on top of the machine, and offers a cartridge slot to permit
|  playing cartridge or CD games; the cartridge port is accessible while
|  using the CD-ROM drive.

   The Jaguar CD-ROM drive allows delivery of full-screen, full-motion video.
   The CinePak video decompression system has been licensed from SuperMac
   Technologies, and permits over sixty minutes of video to be stored on a
   single compact disc at 30 frames a second.  Movie quality pictures can then
   be overlaid on the screen with computer generated graphics if the game
   demands it.  Time-Warner has licensed a library of film clips from its
   movies to Atari for use in Jaguar games.

   The Jaguar CD-ROM is also designed to interface with audio CD, Karaoke CD,
   CD+Graphics and optional Kodak Photo CD.  The system will not be 3DO
   compatible or CD-I compatible.  An optional MPEG2 (Motion Picture Experts
   Group) compression cartridge may also be available, to allow users to play
   full length motion pictures from CD.

|  The latest release date for the CD-ROM drive is middle of 1994.  It has
|  been rumored, though, that the unit may be delayed until September 1994, to
   allow more CD games to be ready for its release.

==============================================================================

Q. What's this "Panther" I hear about?

A. Quick history lesson: Sometime in the late 1980s, Atari Corp. was doing
   research and development on "next generation" video game consoles.  There
   were two systems, a 32-bit machine called the Panther, and a 64-bit machine
   called the Jaguar.  It is reported that work on the Jaguar was progressing
   better/faster than expected, so Atari abandoned the Panther to focus their
   energies on the Jaguar instead.

   Reports of development work on the Panther have been whispered since 1988;
   some people have erroneously mistaken those rumors to be about the Jaguar.

   The Panther reportedly was considered a "32-bit" machine by Atari, though
   for reasons unknown.  It featured three chips, consisting of a Motorola
   68000 running at 16Mhz, an object processor called the Panther, and an
   Ensoniq sound processor called Otis, featuring 32 sound channels.  The
   Panther could supposedly display 8,384 colors from a palette of 262,144
   colors, and could display 83,840 sprites of any size simultaneously.

==============================================================================

Q. What do I get when I buy a Jaguar?
 
A. The Jaguar package has a suggested retail price of $250, and contains the
   Jaguar itself, one controller, an AC adaptor, and the game CYBERMORPH.
   There are rumors that a lower-priced package will be made available,
   without the free game, but that information has not yet been confirmed.

€==============================================================================
 
Q. I want something better than RF output from my Jaguar.  What do I do?
 
A. Atari has an adaptor available that gives the Jaguar composite audio/video
|  output.  The price is $19.95.  The S-Video cables are currently
|  unavailable.

|  If you are willing to build your own, the schematics for the expansion port
|  are as follows:

==============================================================================

Q. How does the ComLynx port on the Jaguar work? Can I connect my Lynx to it?

A. The Jaguar does not have a ComLynx port per se, but has a ComLynx signal
|  on the system bus.  In theory, an expansion port add-on would make the port
|  accessible.

   In theory, it would be possible to daisy-chain multiple units of Jaguars
   and Lynxes for multiplayer games.  At the current time, however, no such
   plans are in the works.  Instead, it is seen as allowing Lynxes to be used
   as peripherals: software can be developed to allow Lynxes to be part of a
|  Jaguar game as "smart" controllers.

==============================================================================
 
Q. Who are the third-party developers for the Jaguar?
 
A. The following companies have been announced as official developers for
   Jaguar software:

Q. How is development for the Jaguar done?

A. Jaguar game development environments exists for the Atari TT030 computer or
   an IBM PC/compatable.  Art development can be performed on any machine,
   whether a low-end Apple Macintosh or commercial rendering software such as
   SoftImage.

   Estimated price for a developer's package is $9,000 for the TT030 setup,
   and $7,500 for the PC/compatable platform.  The package includes a Jaguar
   development unit, documentation, and development/debugging software.  The
|  PC development system is not completed at the time of this writing.
|  Software routines packaged with the system include a multi-channel
|  polyphonic FM/Wavetable synth; JPEG decompression; video set-up; drawing
|  primitives; 3D rendering with gourad shading, texture mapping, and camera
|  manipulation.

   The centerpiece of the TT030 deveopment platform is DB, an assembly-
   language level debugging tool.  The Jaguar and the TT030 are connected with
   a parallel cable, and software can be debugged interactively without
   interfering with the Jaguar's screen display.  DB supports the use of
   scripts and aliases, which simplifies the use of complex or common
   functions.

   Atari grants final code approval, but does not see the need to "censor"
   games.  Every game is given one man-month of compatability and quality
   testing before it is approved.  Atari offers technical support via FAX,
   mail, electronic mail and voice.  Atari allows developers to source their
   own cartridges, documentation and shells if desired.
