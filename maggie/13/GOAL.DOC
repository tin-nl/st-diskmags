        Dino Dini - easy life.  Write  one  game,  modify it a bit and
keep re-releasing and raking in the  money.  I  have to admit that I'm
one of the suckers who has bought  every version of his peculiar brand
of football. This game features all his usual hallmarks - crap coding,
a myriad of bugs and amazing gameplay. With Dino, you have to take the
good with the bad.

        Goal has been hanging  around  on  various other computers for
some time now and has  finally  made  its  way  to the ST. As football
games traditionally sell by  the  bucket-load  on  the  ST, so this is
hardly a brave move  by  Virgin.  Yes,  I  did  say  Virgin - Dino has
ditched his Anco roots and headed for the glittering lights of Richard
Branson's software wing. This begs the question, how will Anco survive
as they only ever released one  good  game? Presumably they still have
the rights to the Kick  Off  series  and  it  looks like these will be
released on the Jaguar.  If  they're  sensible  they  may even release
'Kick Off 3' and get a decent coder to program it, but I digress.

        The first thing you see on booting goal is an intro - yes Dino
steps into the realm  of  intro  coding.  Owners  of  Kick  Off 1 will
remember the annoyingly crap sample-theme-intro-thing that slowed down
loading of the game and  caused  the  masses  to  reach for the volume
dial. On the Goal! intro there  is  some  suitably ropy chip music and
some text effect. Exciting stuff.  We  also  learn that a certain 'Pam
Dini' was involved in  the  production  of  the  game.  Whether she is
Dini's wife, daughter or mother  we  don't  know,  but we can have fun
speculating.

        Skipping on past the intro and you are presented with the main
menu. This features an enhanced version  of  the point and click intro
we are used to from games  like  'Player Manager'. All the options are
displayed on 3D buttons  -  its  just  like  using  the Falcon desktop
(well, not quite!).

        The most frequently  accessed  sub-menu  will  probably be the
OPTIONS one. This give you Kick Off  2  like control. The pitch can be
normal, wet, muddy,  Wembley  or  random.  Unfortunately  there  is no
sandpit option so Villa fans will be disappointed. The duration of the
halves can be one, three, five, ten or twenty minutes. I can't imagine
anyone playing 2*1 minutes matches, and  its  a  pity you can't play a
full length (2*45) match like you could  on Kick Off 1. You can toggle
the wind on or off -  those  of  you playing Wimbledon style should be
wary of this option!
        Two interesting options are Keeper  Skill and Computer Skill -
both of which  can  be  toggled  between  easy,  medium  and hard. The
goalkeepers are a lot easier to beat  in Goal! and even putting Keeper
Skill to hard won't stem the  flow  of  goals. Computer Skill seems to
Ähave more effect - on  hard  the  computer will retain possession more
and is more purposeful going forward.
        You have the option  of  having  automatic replays after every
goal (do you really want to relive your defensive nightmares?), saving
every replay or turning replays off.
        One unique feature of goal is  the ability to change the pitch
layout - you can play  a  traditional  Kick  Off like vertical game or
switch to a horizontally scrolling game.  I wouldn't advise the latter
- the scrolling is based on horizontal  raster so you don't really get
the illusion of moving when  running  left  or right. Also things slow
down terribly in the goal mouth.
        Another new feature is the  option  to  select the scale. Your
view can be zoomed in so the sprites are big and you don't see much of
the pitch (traditional Kick Off) or zoomed out so sprites are tiny and
you see a lot of the pitch  (Sensible soccer style). It defaults to an
Auto setting so during play  it  is  zoomed  in and during goal kicks,
throw ins and free  kicks  it  is  zoomed  out  so  you  have a better
perspective on the event.
        You can also turn on/off the  scanner, toggle the crowd fx and
change the referee. If you are happy  with  your setup you can save it
to disk. You also have the option to load other setups.

        After you've set up the  options,  you'll probably dive into a
Single Match. First  up  you  can  select  who  controls  the  teams -
joystick or computer. Unfortunately  there  is  only  a maximum of two
players on screen - no three or  four  player options like Kick Off 2.
Then you can pick the teams - their is a choice of 32 of the top teams
in  Europe  including  Athletico   Madrid,   AC  Milan  and  Sheffield
Wednesday.Å(*)Ä Next,you can pick the skill of your team - the worst and
slowest being Novice, then  Amateur,  Semi-Pro,  Pro  and best of all,
Ace. There is an appreciable difference between each level!
Å(*)Uuuuuummmmmm...-Ed..Ä

        After you've got this sorted out you can pick your team (or go
with  the  default  selection).  You  can  investigate  each  player's
attributes - pace,  stamina,  aggression,  resilience,  keeping skill,
tackling  skill,  passing  skill  and  shooting  skill.  These  aren't
represented by numbers like in previous games, but as bars which makes
comparisons more difficult. You can  also  view the opposition team to
evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.
        After being informed of who won  the  toss, who the referee is
and the wind direction you  are  into  the  game.  The first thing you
notice is the sprites are massive  compared  to kick off 2. The second
thing you notice is that nothing else has really changed....
        The gameplay has slightly  changed.  The  joystick control for
trap/pass, chip and aftertouch are the same. When kicking the ball you
have to  make  sure  you  are  actually  touching  it,  you  also have
acceleration when running and you can't stop dead so the ball is quite
likely to run away from you if  you're not careful. Overhead kicks and
headers have to be judged differently from Kick Off 2, passing is more
accurate and  intuitive,  but  the  biggest  difference  comes  in the
shooting department. When you are  near  enough  the goal you can just
tap fire and the computer  will  determine  the  direction of the ball
depending on the current  players  shooting  ability.  This means that
Ägoals are more spectacular and easier to score.
        Also throw ins, goal kicks and  free  kicks have changed - you
know have a lot more control  over  the speed, height and direction of
the ball.
        On the whole, the gameplay is  very  similar  to Kick Off - it
has that difficult  to  master  quality  that  makes  it  all the more
rewarding once you learn how to play it.
        Another nice feature is the  inclusion of a post-match report.
This gives statistics on the number of corners, throw-ins, goal kicks,
fouls, penalties,  red  cards,  yellow  cards,  injuries, substitutes,
saves, shots  on  goal  and  percentage  play.  It  makes  interesting
reading.

        Other features include  practice  -  which  is recommended for
newcomers to this genre of game. Not only can you practice skills, but
also penalties which have  changed  from  the previous incarnations of
this game. Gone is the  rapidly  moving  arrow,  you  tap fire and use
aftertouch to place the ball.

        There a league competition - this is built of anything between
2 and 32 teams. Each team can play  each other between 1 and 10 times,
you can also pick points for a win  (2 or 3) and the skill of computer
teams and human teams.

        The cup feature isn't included in other versions (so I've been
told). This is also fully configurable  -  you  can pick the number of
rounds and the legs in each round.

        The third competition is called  'Arcade Challenge', quite why
I'm not sure. Possibly to appeal  to  sad people who waste their lives
in arcades, possibly to  appeal  to  the  console-owning contingent or
possibly because they couldn't think of  a better title. Basically you
have to beat five  teams  who  are  progressively  more skillful. Your
'high score' is made up of you  goal  differences - for the first team
this is multiplied by one, for  the  second team your gd is multiplied
by two and so on. Its a novel  idea  - however the first two teams are
miles too easy for anyone with any experience of the game and the last
two are very tricky. Most people  will be happier playing single games
against an opponent of their choice.

        The edit team feature is handy for  those of you who support a
team not featured amongst the Goal!  32.  You  can also choose the kit
style and colour.

        Unlike its predecessors,  Goal  requires  one  meg  of memory.
Presumably this memory is used mainly on the slightly enhanced samples
in game - you can hear the crowd 'ooooh' after a near miss. One little
gripe with the character set -  its  crap.  The eights look like zeros
(everyone I  know  who  has  seen  have  thought  they  were  zeros!).
Presentation is quite good with  all  the  3D  buttons and sub menus -
although some of these have  a  tendency  to  lock-up at times. The in
game graphics are no better  or  worse  than  the other Kick Off games
they are simply bigger  (or  smaller  depending  on whether you picked
zoomed in or zoomed out).
Ä        The gameplay is,  as  ever,  astonishing.  The  control method
gives you so much scope -  every  game  really is different. There are
things about it I don't like -  the  fact  its easy to score from Kick
Offs, when you receive  a  ball  and  move  the  other  way and end up
chipping it back  where  it  came  from  and  also  the  fact that the
computer can easily intercept long clearances and very unrealistically
volley them straight back into your net.
        Because of all the  different  teams,  skill levels and keeper
levels it is easy to find a team to match your Goal playing skill. The
toughest teams at top skill  levels  provide  much more of a challenge
than anything seen in Kick Off 2 or Final Whistle.

        The main problem  with  the  game  is  its  unreliability - it
crashes more often than MultiTOS! The  main  problem is that Dino Dini
is not a very good coder. With  the original Kick Off, he put together
a raster  routine  with  some  very  basic  sprite  and  line  drawing
routines. Add  to  this  the  artificial  intelligence  of  a computer
opponent - and presto you have a  footie game. What made it unique was
its control method. It was bug ridden and  you were as likely to see a
hat-trick of  bombs  than  score  three  goals.  With  his  subsequent
releases the control method  was  touched  up  -  but  there were also
glaring bugs with throw  ins  going  to  the  wrong  team and frequent
crashes.
        The bugs in Goal are  as  abundant  as  they are annoying. The
first things are trivial graphic  glitches  - sprites not being erased
and thus leaving a mess on the screen, lines being left on the screen.
When a substitute comes on the  teams  will be given totally different
kits for a short  period  of  time.  The  bug  with  the throw ins has
thankfully gone, to be replaced by some nasty little errors. Sometimes
when you go to pick  the  team  the  mouse handler won't recognise the
fire button any more causing you to  be stuck in a sub-menu, some sub-
menus occasionally lock up altogether. Worst  of all, in the middle of
a game it frequently bombs out and goes back to the desktop - quite an
interesting  effect,  the  desktop  with  rasters!  For  a  commercial
release, this is an unacceptable level of errors.
        Another annoying feature is the speed  -  it is not as fast as
its predecessors. For some reason, when  you get into the penalty area
the game slows to a crawl,  if  using the horizontal option this makes
the game unplayable.
        It would have been nice if  Dino had abandoned the rasters and
coded an STe/Falcon only game using  the hardware scrolling and having
some proper background graphics.

        I would love to slag off  this  game completely. The fact that
it was released months after  the  Amiga  version  and still bugged to
hell shows a lack of professionalism  on  the  part of both Virgin and
Dino Dini. Sadly, the game is so good that  all I can do is give it my
heartiest recommendation. Goal is  the  new  definitive football game,
and is certainly a game  you  can't  afford  to  be without. Grit your
teeth, and prepare for some serious green raster based action.
