         The Complex and Disheartening life and times of
         Louis Macneice, a Poet-Type Person.............

By CIH (Aged 17.427 years..)

This document is an interesting expose of early creative genuis,or 
a searching  series of case notes for  a major league  personality
disorder.. The  age  factor   is   certainly  correct,   this  was 
'inspired'   by   the  constant  torture  of   'A-level'   English 
Literature, so why did a semi-famous 20th Century poet get all the 
stick,  as opposed to Bill Shakespeare or Geoff Chaucer? (Answer:-
Those two were too bloody boring to take the piss out of..)

This  story is now ten years old,  I thought it was time for it to 
be  aired to a wider audience than Stuart (Hi there you scummy  PC 
owner!) So here we go!

(The  story is ten years old apart from the bits I've  extensively 
re-written,  a  few  "Funny-at-the-time" Sixth-Form in-jokes  have 
therefore  had  to  bite  the  dust,  quite a  bit  of  the  story 
is recreated from memory, some new bits have been added too..)

WARNING!  The events and characters depicted in this story do bear 
a very slight resemblance to actual people and things,  if anybody 
feels  miffed by this (Surviving relatives of Adolf  Hitler,  etc) 
then I am slightly sorry, but won't let this get in the way of the 
story development...   So there....

(OK,  this first bit will be recreated from memory,  as up to last 
year,  this 'masterwork' survived intact,  that is,  until I moved 
house...  The  period  up  to 1918 is therefore conjecture  on  my 
part..)

P.S.  Is  anybody  doing  this guy,  like now,  for their ENG  LIT 
syllabus?? Good luck, you'll need it!!

LOUIS  EDUORD  MACNEICE  was  born  in  1892  in  Padraig,  County 
Starvation,   Ireland,  for  a  poet,  his  formative  years  were 
distressingly  free of the major childhood traumas and terrors  so 
necessary in the 'Poet-Forming process'..

For  example,  he  did not suffer the ritual physical  and  sexual 
humiliations  at  the minor public school for  slightly  diffident 
gentlemen  he  attended  when  he was eight  years  old,  and  was 
described by his Latin Master "Binky" Jenko Jenkins as "Too normal 
and well adjusted to fit into the school, although quite well hung 
for a boy of his tender years,  with a nice slim pair of thighs to 
boot.."

The young Louis found solace in innocent games of  'Pleb-Shooting' 
as  on  one memorable October day one hundred  and  sixteen  local 
€villagers went down screaming their lungs out under the all-mighty 
roar  of  Macneice's  twelve-bore shotgun..  It was thus  that  he 
became a fully integrated member of the upper classes..

A  period of time at a prestigious old University was  inevitable, 
the entrance examination to Cambridge conducted by a  distinguised 
professor  with  rather cold fingers,  at least cold fingers to  a 
part of the body not normally exposed to the open air, resulted in 
an  easy  place where Macneice could start to develop  his  latent 
poetic  talents.....  These were very latent at this stage,  as an 
early surviving fragment of his student work testifies..

            Dog

     A dog is but a dog,
     and not a cat...
     But who is to say
     why..

In  common  with other members of the 'In-crowd' of the  age,  the 
Bloomsbury  set,  he  experienced some difficulty with the  toilet 
seats, they came crashing down onto his skull whenever he tried to 
take  a drink out of the bog..  With headsplitting pains  rumbling 
across  his cerebral cortex,  Macneice muttered it was about  high 
time for World War One...

And  being  that sort of a lucky sod,  it was 1914,  storm  clouds 
gathering over Europe (Blah!) Lights going out never to be lit  in 
my lifetime (Blahblah!) and all that stuff...

At  last all the conditions for major poetry were to  hand,  rats, 
mud,  poison gas,  Wilfred Owen,  those crap music hall songs that 
were  a Long Way to Tipperary,  unfortunately Louis Macneice found 
himself being transferred to a quiet part of the line where  large 
set-piece  banquets and no death and mutilation were in  evidence, 
He became (Perhaps in light of his previous Cambridge  experience) 
the Commode keeper to General Foch, the French Supreme Commander..

General  Foch's Commode was a special musical Commode which  often 
performed  at  the Covent Garden opera,  as it had a  particularly 
clear and beautiful Soprano voice,  and Macneice's duties involved 
keeping  it  happy  and entertained  between  performances..  Thus 
Macneice's poetical development stagnated, whilst Owen and Sassoon 
were  gloriously **having the gangrenous stump of their  left  leg 
gnawed by eight foot mutant trench rats** and generally having the 
time of their (Rather short) poetical life..

*Yes  both  of  them at the same time!  There was something  of  a 
punch-up over who had the idea first..*

It  was about this time,  the first suggestion of an adult  mature 
relationship arose...  The 'Little French Miss in Armentieres' was 
Clemantine  the paperclip,  but Macneice was only a dumbstruck and 
distant  admirer at this stage,  Clemantine's trim and  suggestive 
€metal-frame body also attracted the attentions of General  Douglas 
Haig,  the  British Supreme Commander who would spend long idyllic 
sunlit  afternoons  in her company  playing  teasing  affectionate 
games  of "Let's see who can order most men to a certain death  in 
the trenches in yet another pointless offensive.."

Clemantine always let Haig win those ones..

It  was  not until late in the war that Macneice  had  his  single 
authentic  'War-like' experience when due to a severe  cock-up  on 
the  map-reading front by the local German artillery commander,  a 
rain  of  steel and high explosive landed on the bit  of  the  map 
marked "Generals and privileged hangers-on only - Do not  Shell.." 
(In German of course..)

As a series of moans and cries sprang from the ghastly silence,  a 
dazed and bleeding Macneice found the following things missing:-

The  lower bit of his left leg,  General Foch's Musical  Commode's 
sense of self-esteem,  95% of the vintage champagne,  and worst of 
all, CLEMANTINE!! of whom, no trace could be found...

(And I think this is where the original manuscript picks up  again 
- CIH...)

After a long spell in a field hospital for slightly  disorientated 
people,  he was nasally discharged from the British Army in 1918.. 
But  by  way of a compliment for his soldierly  qualities  he  was 
presented with the seat from General Foch's Singing Commode  which 
promptly brought back 'memories of Cambridge' as the forerunner of 
a massive headache rumbled across his brow..

Macneice  returned  to  his  ancestral  home  in  Padraig,  County 
Starvation,  Ireland.  There he became involved in the underground 
activities of the Irish Free State opinion pollsters taking a  low 
key  roll  as  a  driver on  a  getaway  steamroller..  They  were 
sucessful  for a number of months but the tentacles of  the  Royal 
Ulster Constabulary closed in one night on the gang hideout in the 
only electric lamp post in Padraig..

An  eight-hour  gun  battle  followed,   in  the  resulting  heavy 
exchanges of wooden furniture,  Macneice came out with a couple of 
pine  tables,  whilst the rest of the group perished in a blaze of 
glory, along with the cat and milk bottles..

A mysterious letter summoning him to Newfoundland entailed a quick 
journey  to  America,  which he had intended to do  originally  in 
1912,  travelling  very  cheaply  on  the left  propellor  of  the 
'Titanic'  but  circumstances had  dictated  otherwise..  Instead, 
clinging to the support struts of the airship 'Graf Von  Zeppelin' 
he   rushed   to   keep  his   rendevous   with   the   mysterious 
correspondent..

The  letter turned out to be written by the lower portion  of  his 
€left leg,  now known as Heinz Stumpph,  on behalf of another Great 
War survivor,  Clemantine,  the paper clip who had decided to take 
matters  into her own hands,  after being so abruptly parted  from 
General  Haig..  It was with total ecstasy and delight that  Louis 
Macneice  presented  her  with a specially  written  poem  in  her 
honour..

              Loves Labours Lost in the left Luggage

My head bounces on the floor, as I consider the gap of waiting
in halls
for Clemantine...

I see a glimmer in the distance, I see little boxes with
Paperclips, then Grenade pins..

I see my love given to hold two sheets of A4 in place...
My pen has run out again, oh Sh*t!!!


Whilst he was absent, the campaign in Ireland reached fever pitch, 
as  the  remaining Irish Free State opinion  pollsters  floated  a 
massive  2 x 400 mile opinion poll in the Eastern  Atlantic..  The 
resulting gloppy mess forced the British Government into a partial 
concession on the issue of who kept the spare wire coat-hangers..

Louis  Macneice  married  Clemantine in the Spring  of  1929,  for 
fairly  obvious reasons,  the relationship was never  successfully 
consummated,  leaving  Macneice  desperately frustrated,  sexually 
speaking.  He  resorted  to dark and dangerous practices  such  as 
eating  copies  of the New Jersey State Telephone  Directory,  and 
would  have  been  shunned by society if this  had  become  widely 
known..  However,  in  other  respects,  the marriage was generally 
successful..

Macneice   respected   the  then  advanced   ideas   proposed   by 
Clemantine..  Being  a  naturally  compassionate  and  progressive 
personality  he was perturbed by the second class status  suffered 
by paperclips..  However,  the heavily pre-publicised campaign for 
paperclip  suffrage  fell apart rather badly,  when at  the  first 
campaign  meeting,  one  of  the speakers used  just  three  words 
"table",  "Chair"  and  "Armour-plating" in the space of  an  hour 
frothed  at  the mouth and fell over convulsing  violently..  That 
speaker was Macneice...

Events moved on,  as one fine day in 1929, a very small person who 
normally  specialised  in  finding old  electrical  components  on 
rubbish  dumps  (Hi  there Pixie (Dave H.)  this  is  your  second 
mention in a recent work of fiction, what do you think eh!) Walked 
into  the  Wall  Street Stock Exchange  yelling  "Herbert  Hoover, 
spirit  of Depression past present and future,  but all my friends 
call me Herbie the Love Bug in a pink dress!"

From there all the financial indicators plummeted faster than  the 
€distressed  speculators  from  their  very  tall  buildings  (They 
plummet at 32 feet per second,  per second, I believe..) The Great 
Depression had arrived..

Macneice did his bit in trying to counsel thosse unfortunates  who 
had  suffered bereavements with their life-savings with  a  simple 
message..  This  was  "Be happy,  enjoy the simple pleaasures  of 
life, relax, have fun.."

The following 'concrete' poem emphasises his views at that time..

  "Goodbye, I'm going now!"
                           \
                            |W

                            |e
                           \ /
                          THUD!!  (Bump!) (Bump!)
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

(I  think  another page,  of which I remember v.  little has  gone 
walkies,  urm  let  me see...  I think we say a bit more about the 
Great  Depression or something,  I'll just have to make  something 
up..)

But  there was really no real escape from the omnipresent  terrors 
of  the  Great  Depression  which were  more  numerous  than  dead 
children,  and  by the end of that year it was announced that  the 
national  reserves  of  old  string were  at  an  all-time  low... 
Disatisfaction led to a new government which was firmly under  the 
despotic thumb of a radiator..

Under these circumstances any poet could not fail to be happy, and 
Macneice was ecstatic..

Abroad,  the  indicators  were  equally desperate,  in the  Soviet 
Union,  Lenin was being extremely silly, especially as he had been 
dead  for several years,  in Germany the slapping of thighs by men 
with  toothbrush moustaches was positively compulsory,  in America 
another of Macneice's poems was published..

€                             Coincidence

                Yesterday I was surprised to find
                      Aunt Bernice in a pie..
                        Shoobie doobie wah!

               The Day before it was Uncle Bernard
                         in the custard..
                        Shoobie doobie wah!

                       What a coincidence!!
                     Badumm! Badumn! Badumn!

This  poem was well received,  particularly as an  ultra-absorbent 
wrapper for fish..

The direction of Macneice's life was to change for the worse  when 
the  National  Socialist  Thigh-Slapping party came  to  power  in 
Germany with their oddly odd leader Adolf Hitler..

(Here comes the main manuscript again..)

Hitler   had   little  charm  for  he  invited  P.J   Proby,   the 
trousersplitting  '60's  rock  star to  take  part..  The  obvious 
breaking  point  for  most  people  was  when  Hitler  started  to 
sacrifice people on a 300 feet bakelite replica of Glen Miller..

Macneice was not helped by the unwelcome surge of problems in  his 
long-term  relationship  with  Clemantine  who  was  beginning  to 
suspect  there  was more to his liasons with  young  and  innocent 
telephone  directories than just a mere "Proof-Reading  session".. 
Having  caught Macneice in what can be most delicately  termed,  a 
'bedroom  situation'  with the Camberley  District  Yellow  Pages, 
Clemantine   failed  to  secure  a  reasonable  explanation   from 
Macneice,  who then went on to ignore her whilst doing a three-day 
crossword puzzle in honour of his stapling machine..

After  the  three days were up,  Macneice felt the  furrowings  of 
guilt over his behaviour and searched for Clemantine..

A  scene of absolute horror greeted Macneice on the  garden  path. 
where  all that remained of her was a rust-red outline of  a  dead 
paperclip,  a  further  search of the kitchen cupboard  found  the 
suicide note...

Dear Louis,,,
             Us paperclips arent stupid
             Just 'cos we don't do a lot
             Give me some credit for thinking
             I know whats going on
             Between you me and the cat
             Im going to top myself
             Goodbye!!!!!!!

€Utterly distraught,  Macneice went to Spain to check on the shell-
holes on the beaches,  and went back home an hour later like a lot 
of  the  other  famous left-wing intellectuals who  also  went  to 
Spain,  meanwhile,  Hitler  was sewing his name-tags into his P.E. 
Shorts and into most of Europe..

About this time Macneice went into semi-retirement floating around 
on a polystyrene cube in the Indian Ocean (in his own words..)
"Waiting for the muse of inspiration to come up out of the  depths 
and hit me with a wet, pregnant haddock around the chops.."

She duly obliged, here is Macneice's

                Ballad of Finchley Central

q. Hey you, condemned man, don't eat your last breakfast
   with your head actually on the block..

q. Stop for a while, enjoy the scenery slowly turning
   red as you bleed copiously into your hanky...

q. What was it you wanted sir, Egg, Bacon, 
   Something to drink, or a roll of Sellotape...

a. Yes, it must be Sellotape..

This  poem  was fairly well received,  a first edition  of  10,000 
copies sold out to a well-known chain of fish and chip shops..

A  major  lifelong  influence was the  poet  and  lifelong  friend 
W.H.Auden,  briefly  (This is after all,  Macneice's Biography) he 
was  born  the son of an upper-class stinking hovel  builder,  for 
education and brutality he was sent to Eton,  where he, along with 
all  the other first-years or 'Scum' were  ritually  dismembered.. 
(For  ages  afterwards,  he wrote with the help of a  special  pen 
worked with his teeth..)

He  also  went  on  to Cambridge,  where by  that  time  they  had 
liberalised  on  the issue of toilet seats..  He missed the  First 
World  War by taking the simple step of registering as  chocolate-
coated..

He  first  met  Macneice  when he  was  having  profound  artistic 
difficulties  and  was trying to repair his  skull  with  repeated 
applications  of  a tyre-lever to his temples...  Taking  Macneice 
aside, hand in stump, Auden said "Louis, if life makes you want to 
beat your brains out, then WRITE about it.."

Auden was a patient teacher,  he took more time than was necessary 
in  trying  to  pick out worthwhile imagery  from  the  cracks  in 
Macneice's 'Sandcastle poems' (All of these were pretty  ephemeral 
creations, they were washed away by the next tide..)

One  day,  Auden  decided  the re-occurring images of  prunes  and 
€garlic  were  just  the tiniest bit wearing,  could  someone  send 
another  World  War to write about..  Anyway it would taste a  bit 
better, or at least different.. 

One darkening evening in June 1939,  a lower portion of a left-leg  
hopped  furtively through the streets of Berlin...  Shortly after, 
Hitler  began to talk (Or rant,  which was a more normal state  of 
mind  for  this person..) about a "Polish Conspiracy  to  forcibly 
shave-off  the  fine Aryan moustaches of German men,  and  replace 
them with long straggly Jewish looking facial hairs instead."

Anybody  with legs in Poland was to be shot and Poland smashed  to 
bits, right after his summer holiday..

Late August 1939,  a desperate situation goes from bad to verse,as 
having  found  a poetry book,  Hitler orders the troops  in  using 
words containing only the letters 'A', 'T', and 'L'..

World War II had well and truly begun..

Macneice went to look for a landmine to sit on,  but was really to 
old to take part in any actual fighting, his attempts to enlist as 
a depth-charge came to nothing..

W.H Auden responded to the crisis by becoming even more  debauched 
in  his  sexual  practices than Macneice at his  worst.  He  would 
invite  impressionable young library books home and then  snip-off 
their corners, the authorities were strangely reluctant to act for 
a  long  time,  even when confronted with distraught  and  tearful 
copies  of 'Old Moores Almanac' found in the alleyway adjacent  to 
Auden's  London flat...  An eventual arrest was inevitable though, 
at  his trial at the Old Bailey,  Auden defended his practices  by 
saying  "Reading the last page then snipping-off the corners is  a 
practice millions of years old.. Failure to do this killed off the 
dinosaurs.."

There was no hesitation on the Jury's part in awarding a  'Guilty' 
verdict,  Auden  was then dropped on Germany in an attempt to make 
them surrender early..  (The Germans were totally unmoved by this, 
they sent Sigmund Freud over by way of retaliation..)

It became clear that the lower-left portion of Macneice's left leg 
had  taken a central role in the German government.  both Macneice 
and  Douglas Bader were questioned sharply on this  subject  until 
Bader admitted his toenail clippings had all defected to the Nazis 
in 1935..

France  was  lost when the French left it behind in  a  restaurant 
cloakroom,  the  ever-eager Germans moved in and in the "Mother of 
all  Swap  Shops" discussed terms by presenting  200,000,000  bent 
coins  in  a railway carriage..  The French negotiated in a  prone 
position  with  their  heads  removed,  the  British  were  busily 
inventing Cross-Channel 'Boozer Cruiser' day trips at Dunkirk..

€Macneice's  own  personal situation declined to such a  low  point 
that he undertook a Scottish tour..

He only got as far as his front sitting room, where he embarked on 
another critically acclaimed masterpiece..

                P r a y e r   B e f o r e   B i r t h 

                               I hope 
                                 they 
                                 get 
                             room service
                             sorted out
                           in big hotels
                          by the time I'm
                           old enough to
                         wee on the seats..

                             Is that a 
                              problem
                               or not
                             I didn't
                             ask to be
                             conceived
                              anyway..

After  this creative high point,  Macneice made his way to Iceland 
to avoid any "Nasty repercussions with that Mr Hitler person"

Meanwhile, back to the war, the mighty Luftwaffe was vanquished in 
the  Battle  of Britain by the simple (And  hitherto  undisclosed) 
method  of  building  an eight-mile high brick wall  in  front  of 
London..

Meanwhile,  in  the  Pacific,  an air-pageant and firework display 
went  horribly wrong at Pearl Harbor,  the surviving bits of  film 
were pieced together and it won three Oscars though it only  broke 
even  at the box-office..  Frank Sinatra's leg broke evenly in six 
places..

Ultimately,  the war for the Axis powers started to be lost when a 
kebab-roasting  machine  programmed to drink the  Fuhrer's  health 
exploded   in   mid-roast  leaving  Central  Berlin   covered   in 
potentially  lethal  lamb  eyelids..   The  American  Atomic  Bomb 
programme  went ahead with the help of refugee Austrian  Physicist 
Heinz Stumph, the multi-personality that was Macneice's lower left 
leg,  and  who could see which way the wind was blowing unpleasant 
consequences-wise, who then decided to defect to the Allies..

In   1945,   Benito  Mussolini  learnt  a  fundamental  lesson  of 
successful Fascist Dictatorship, never try to issue orders hanging 
upside-down..

Hitler  arranged his own suicide in April 1945 with Soviet  shells 
€crashing around his head..  It was a pathetic affair, he was found 
clinging  to  a  Walther 7.92mm automatic with  a  clockwork  frog 
embedded  in his forehead.  He was then cremated using the bunkers 
stock  of  'Naughty  Humphrey'  magazines...   In  spite  of  this 
significant  setback,  Hitler went on to manage many famous 1960's 
Musical acts.. ("She Loves You, Ja, Ja, Ja??")

After  the dust settled once Japan had been bombed into  producing 
attractive  consumer  goods  at competitive  prices,  the  postwar 
atmosphere  was one of new hope and rebuilding of lives which  did 
not  give Macneice much scope for his kind of work..  In  artistic 
terms  this  was  Macneice's  'Dry-Up'  or  'Tampon'  period,  the 
following  poem written at that time dramatically illustrates  the 
point..

            Snatching Defeat FROM the Jaws OF Victory


           A smile forms on at least eight of my lips..

               It must have been something I ate..

                    I must not do it again...


At one stage in 1948,  he stopped writing altogether,  an imminent 
rehabilitation into normal human society was feared..

These  fears seemed justified when he no longer turned up  in  the 
fashionable  cafes  of London,  wearing nothing but a  bolt-cutter 
strung  around  his neck,  instead he made a point of dressing  up 
within a replica woolly dog..

(And at this point,  dear readers,  the original manuscript ceases 
altogether,  I  had intended to take the story until the 'sixties' 
because the original article died in 1964,  shall I carry on, wait 
and see!! - CIH..)

Well you didn't have to wait long!

Throughout  the 1950's Macneice got married (To a woman and not  a 
paperclip)  got a proper job,  and wore a suit and trilby to work, 
it  was simply impossible to have any other sort of  lifestyle  at 
that time,  he was only momentarily cheered up by the invention of 
bigger and nastier bombs of a continent-destroying persuasion, and 
by the resulting 'Cold-War paranoia'...

Macneice is thought to have been involved in politics, strictly at 
a local level, although he became fascinated with the young Harold 
Wilson and his 'Pipe of Doom'.. He is only thought to have written 
one more thing before his death in 1964, here it is..

      Two pints semi-skimmed
      One pint Gold-Top
€      Strawberry Yoghurt
      5 pounds of Potatoes

At his death bed,  W.H Auden recorded Macneice's terminal thoughts 
and utterings,  most of these were the product of a feverish dying 
mind,  but  some  of  these were disturbing for  their  subsequent 
accuracy and future consequence..

Firstly  Macneice complained of the "Profusion of TV shows  hosted 
by Ill-fitting small Yorkshiremen who say 'That's Magic'"

He  then went on to talk about "The one they call  Commodore,  who 
will spread gloom and despondency across the land.."

He  then slipped back screaming about "The blue-rinsed woman  from 
hell  who  says  'There  is NO alternative,  the  Lady's  not  for 
turning' and 'Just rejoice at that news'.. 

Then he died..

(C) CIH 1983 and 1993..

(What happened to the Left Leg special:-)

Macneice's left leg lived on long after the poet himself had died, 
as  always,  the  enigmatic  'Master  of  a  thousand  leg-related 
disguises' he may have appeared as any of the following..

Gang-Boss  Jimmy  'No-Knees' McGurk,  the terror of the  New  York 
waterfront area in the 1950's..

The 1960's megastar Rory 'Hey man. I'm completely bodyless' Femur, 
one  of  the many successful acts managed by the  ex-dictator  and 
showbiz impresario Adolf Hitler..

President  Kennedknee,  the  greatest postwar American  politician 
ever to be assassinated into an Oliver Stone film...

Maharishknee  Yogi  Guru  fake mystic with  straggly  beard,  this 
person WAS the 'Flower-power' generation..

And may have finally dropped out of sight as 'Carlos, the Jackal's 
Hindquarters' as the notorious 1970's terrorist..
