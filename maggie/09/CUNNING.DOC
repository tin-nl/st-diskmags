 Well,  well,  well,  here we go again,  several pints of Creme-de-
Menthe,  a  packet  of dry roasted peanuts,  and a quick visit  to 
those  nice  people,  STOMACH PUMP-U-LIKE,  and I am ready for the 
latest STOS mega-epic,   The Cunning Demos,   a two-disk masterpiece 
of  all  the best that the STOS community has to offer..  You  may 
recall  a  review  in  a previous issue of  Maggie,  for  a  piece 
entitled  'Better  Than Life'????  Well,  they are back,  ( Aco and 
Flair,  that is,)  and a whole bunch of other STOS coders,  such as 
the Dentrassi, Radioactive Hedgehogs, Wheee Th' Fibble, and plenty 
of others too..

Not being one to try to uselessly pad out a review ( HA HA HA !!)
 we go straight to the first screen, the 'Screw-Up' screen, this is 
not its official name,  but describes instead, how it looks on my 
(2.5  meg)  machine,  a quick dab at the spacebar takes us to  the 
'Bouncing  Sheep' screen,  which  does  work,  so momentary panic at 
useless disk over..  The bouncing sheep struts his/her/its?  stuff 
against  a  sunlit meadow with the 'Cunning Demos'  title  in  the 
background.  (When  I  say 'bounce',  this sheep really does shift 
like  it  has  something intensely  spring-loaded  up  its  little 
bottom..)

Another  touch  of the space bar takes you to a  screen  with  the 
following,  a  noisetracker tune based on something out of  'Zorba 
the Greek' a scroller at the top of the screen, and a huge pair of 
eyes  in  the middle (Which  don't  follow you  around  the  room..) 
 Rather  a neat screen this,  my decision as a reviewer is entirely 
impartial  and  nothing  to do with some of the  contents  of  the 
scrolltext!!

Now,  to  the main menu,  which is another fiendish torture device 
for  anyone trying to locate all of the screens,  or try to review 
the damn thing.. This time the menu is a  'Spyhunter'  type overhead 
view  driving  game,  with  different doors gaining entry  to  the 
screens, so you will appreciate that many of the following screens 
under review are in no particular order...   You are not allowed to 
stop at any stage, but keep on driving.

1.  ACO  1,  The  Joker ..  a suitable first stop,  with a small top 
scroller,  a  middle  large piccy of the BATMAN arch-nemesis,  the 
Joker,   and  three  small  animated  Jokers  which  are  actually 
indicator bars for the music!!!

2. ACO 2, Not on the Hairs of my Chinny chin chin..  A large double 
bouncing  scroll,  which  move  pretty fast,  and a collection  of 
moving  sprites  against  a  plain  background,  not  one  of  the 
stunners..

3. ACO 3, Minimalistic Sex Orgy..  Uncanny resemblance to a certain 
screen  in  the  ULM  Demo,  pixel-perfect in STOS!!  But  with  a 
soundchip tune, rather than a Quartet type tune.. V.Good!!

4.  Wheee The Fibble..  Nickity Nackety Nooo..   First of the guest 
screens, with a upper and lower large scroller, two large sprites, 
and  lettering  which  sort of stays on the  screen,  the  overall 
effect of mayhem is compounded by the funny story which unfolds in 
the scrollers..

5.  Radioactive hedgehogs,  3-D Ballscreen..  Another guest screen, 
with  lots  and lots,  and even more 3-D ball sprites,  which  are 
coloured to give that lightsourced look,  also on the same screen, 
a  'Radioactive Hedgehogs' logo which tweens and  alternates  with 
itself, nice looking screen..
 
6.  Network,  Unlimited  Bobs  Demo..   A  STOS  coder  from  parts 
Scandinavian,  so  you  can expect something pretty good,  in this 
case,  a  DIY draw-your-own 3-D bobs pattern maker on half of  the 
screen,  and  a  dodgy  piccy on the other half (This may  be  the 
machines fault again..)

7.  ACO 5, Green Jelly..  A screen based on something by Oxygene of 
TLB,  two  vertical  scrollers,  a  screen  full  of  single  line 
horizontal  disting scrolls,  and several shimmery pattern things, 
also digi-drum soundchip music.. A technically strong screen..

 (As  with  the  previous 'Better than Life' demos,  the  music  is 
almost wholly either 'normal' ST-soundchip, or enhanced with Digi-
Drums,  there  are  certain  important  exceptions  which  I  will 
elaborate on (Or have, in one case..))
 

8. Neil of Flair, Road to Wigan Pier..  This screen owes little but 
the  name to George Orwell for inspiration,  consisting of a  left 
hand vertical scroller,  a large central pattern on screen,  and a 
trailing bunch of sprites..

9.  ACO 6, My Donkey Can Carry only One Suitcase..  A true "Cunning 
Demo,"  starts  off deceptively poorly,  with a nicely  drawn  but 
abysmally  shifting  scroller,  and STOS soundchip tune,  which is 
rather  weedy,  the  screen  suddenly improves to  a  much  better 
soundchip  tune,  a  very fast and smooth scroll,  a fast,  smooth 
sprite, and a slideshow of some fairly naughty and often unclothed 
ladies,  it is obvious why the Donkey can carry only one suitcase, 
(He will fall over!!)



10.  Dentrassi,  Earthmoving  screen..   One  of the most impressive 
guest  screens,  a  mini-version of The Exceptions screen  in  the 
Syntax  Terror  demo,  no  less!!  Two screen high virtual  screen 
 thingy,  the  bottom half has piano keys as indicator bars for the 
music,  a  very  large  scroll text and  background  graphix,  the 
scroller  is  semi-transparent.   The  upper  screen  has  another 
separate  scroller,   and  more  background  graphix,  with  pixel 
fountains,  there is a large selection,  ten or so,  tunes in this 
demo, v.v v good!!

11.  ACO 8, The Writing on the Wall..  Probably, Aco's finest hour, 
technically speaking,  vertical picture scroll  with top and bottom 
borders  knocked out!!   Two transparent sprites and more digi-drum 
music.. Don't forget, this is a STOS demo!! (Mostly..)

12.  Wheee the Fibble,  Behold, the can of Tizer is now completely 
flat..   Behold,  this  screen  does  not want to work at  all,  it 
seems..   (You  have to avoid going into any screen with  digi-drum 
musix  first,  apparently...  What  you get is a vector  ball-type 
screen..)
 
13.  The Cool Carrot,  Goodbye Screen..  A rather strange screen, a 
bouncing sprite, followed by a series of very slow 3-D shapes, and 
a looping sample..

14.   The  Happening  Boiz,   Vectorballs  Screen..   Very  uncanny 
resemblance  to  a certain TLB Mindbomb demo  screen,  the  screen 
includes the infamous 3-D vectorballs, indicator bars either side, 
and  a rotating vector-dot cube..  Also a large number of assembly 
language  extensions to hold it all together..Still a  very,  very 
nice screen...

 (On  the  subject of Assembly extensions to STOS,  it  would  seem 
there  is  a  certain  amount of use that  can't  be  helped,  for 
example,  all  the decent chip music requires one of these to work 
at all, borders knocked out etc...)

 15.  ACO 9,  A Song,  a Dance, and a Merry Jape..  Another of Aco's 
"Polished"  period,  another  vertical piccy scroller,  'Clockwork 
Orange'  logo,  and a very large horizontal scrolltext with  added 
 rasters, a screen not out of place in any demo..

16. GBP..  A screen by Bruno, everything runs terribly slowly..

17.  Storm..  Several things onscreen, has a 'Tech-Tron feel, split 
into several horizontal layers, has digi-drum music..

18,  Mutant,  Ooh Look at all of Those..  Ten vertical scrolltexts, 
some background graphix, and indicators for the music..

19.  ACO  7,  ( I  Think,,) Metropolis..   Another of the more superb 
screens,  the 'Wings of Death; "Please Wait" intro kicks off, then 
gives  way  to a digi-drum tune,  and several  horizontal  picture 
scrolls,  a complete scene consisting of, several scrollers at the 
top of the screen, a cityscape whizzes by in one direction, whilst 
planes fly by overhead,  ducking in and out of the clouds,  a very 
good looking screen..

20.  ACO,   (Errm let me see...) Get  off of Moi laaand..  One of the 
earlier  screens,   large  horizontal  scroll,  made  up  of  ball 
patterns, small scroll over the top of this, music by Count Zero..

And I think, that is it...... Thank Kerrrrissstt!!

Ratings:-  (Are people that you have on ships???) 

GRAPHIX:-   79% - Plenty of variety,  a presentation of the mostly, 
good, and thankfully little, bad and ugly..

SONIX:-   79% - Large scale use of soundchip and  Digi-drum  music, 
and at leat one soundtracker tune..

GEE  WHIZZ:-   87%  -  A very wide range  of  subject  matter,  and 
techniques  explored here,  this reviewers particular  favourites, 
the  Dentrassi  screen,  the Metropolis  screen,  and The Writing on 
the Wall..   One tiny whinge,   Why  does the main menu load in  every 
 time,  even  with 1 meg of memory??  The bird with the bright pink 
 and very tight PVC skirt on the loader screen is only  interesting 
the  first couple of dozen times or so..   (Was this developed on a 
half-meg machine!?!?!)
 
OVERALL:-   85% - It can now be safely said that this  is  probably 
the best STOS megademo to date, better than 99% of Amiga demos..
Beware  of the sense of humour,  particularly when approaching the 
main  menu,  do not approach alone!!!  Tell mummy and daddy if you 
see  this  demo,  and they are sure to pour a bucket  of  ice-cold 
water over your intimate parts!!
