A quick review of a long awaited game....

You may well recall a preview in an earlier MAGGIE, in which I 
waxed lyrical about a certain 3-D polygon based action game, 
where you were allowed to wander about a 3-D landscape, 
clambering aboard whatever vehicle took your fancy, usually 
something with fairly heavy offensive power, and rampage around, 
blowing things to bits...

Well after a pause of several months, whilst Activision fell 
to bits, and was reconstituted by the friendly froggies, The Disc 
Company, HUNTER gathered dust, but has now turned up on general 
release (finally..) What is it like daddy???

Well, my child, it comes on one disc, and boots up to load a nice 
title screen, with some suitably martial digi-music, then you hit 
space to get you to the options screen, where there are three 
different modes of play, 'Missions', 'Hunter', and 'Action'.. 
More on the first two, later, but the most straightforward 
'arcade' type game is to be found in the 'Action' option, where 
you are cordially invited to blow as much enemy hardware to bits, 
as you can get close-up to.. (Well they do have a list of 
objectives, which is pretty long, and will need a bit of practice 
to complete..)

Something about the scenario (oh MUST you??), a peace-loving and 
independant group of islands has been invaded by a brutal 
mainland enemy!! (Can I have my money now?? - Mike Singleton..) 
and it is up to a small group of elite soldiers called HUNTERS to 
stop them.. So far, they have managed to contain the enemy 
invasion to about half the island chain, and are trying to throw 
them off completely... This is where you come in, and in view of 
this, my suitcases to Switzerland are already packed...

Are YOU up to the challenge??

As mentioned earlier, the gameplay is a combination of arcade 
type nastiness, and a fair bit of exploring around the islands, 
by any combination of Car/Tank/Speedboat/Helicopter/pushbike, and 
many, many more, including walking, or swimming, if enemy action 
forcibly deprives you of your current vehicle.. Most things 
explode when shot at, but it can be slightly difficult to aim 
across the patchwork quilt, VIRUS-like 3-D landscape.. There is 
also the chance to interact in a limited sense with the island 
population, when performing a specific mission, and you have NOT 
got to destroy the wildlife running around the island, including 
seagulls, fluffy bunnies, rather less fluffy bulls, and totally 
unfluffy sharks... Destroying these gives minus points..


 
So be careful out there..

Graphically, this resembles a number of games, including 
STARGLIDER, and VIRUS, and can be compared to MIDWINTER, it is a 
nice looking game, with a large range of 3-D objects, which moves 
pretty smoothly, there is a 'night' and 'day', as there is a 
clock built in to the game.. These graphics are not quite state 
of the art anymore, but they do work, and the game benefits as a 
result... Sonically, the music is digi-sound, confined to the 
title and end-game screens, with normal soundchip SFX in the 
game.. These rise and fade, according to how far someone is from 
the player...

The other options include short missions with specific 
objectives, to be completed in a limited time period 
('Missions'), and 'Hunter' where you are sent on rather longer 
missions, where the final target location is unknown, and you 
have to contact people to get to the next stage of the mission..
Fortunately, there is the option to SAVE GAME, as this is where 
you gain points and promotions..

Overall, a very good, game, surprisingly addictive, in 
particular, flying helicopters in major-league fun, but watch 
those fuel levels... You also get tons of equipment, including 
bazookas, grenades, parachutes, maps, some aerial reconissance 
units, timebombs, and lots more.....

RATINGS:-

GRAPHIX:- 82% - Not state of the art anymore, but a pleasing 
diversity, and plenty to explore...

SONIX:- 73% - Two decent digi-tunes, and functional spot effects 
in the game itself.. nothing to write home about (But nothing to 
write to complain about either..)

PLAYABILITY:- 90% - The user-interface thingy, graphics, and 
gameplay come together in a way more games should.... C'est 
Bon !!!

OVERALL:- 87% - A very More-ish game, could be a minor classic..

  CIH (C) (The usual..) 12/10/91, KILL 'DEM BUNNIES!!!!
