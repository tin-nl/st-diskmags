 
           THE     S C OO P E X - Mental HANGOVER  Demo..

  (Converted by The Pixel Twins to STE...)

 (Reviewed  by  CIH from some notes done on the back  of  a  Morphy 
Richards Steam Iron instruction pamphlet.. Honestly!!...)

So  where are we....   (Fumbles piece of paper..)  Ahh,  bugger it!! 
 (16-32  PDL 3-D Bob bootsector puts in appearance...  We are  also 
booting up in STE medium res, total waste of time...)   
 
                     The Scoopex Logo!!!!!
 
(Don't worry, it'll settle down in a minute..)

Sprung on an unsuspecting ST world at the 16-Bit fair in February, 
the self-styled 'King' of STE demos appeared,  does it justify its 
position?? Is it any good?? Well, its time to take a look and find 
out..  (So back to the 'Scoopex' Logo, where we are also told that 
this is a Pixel Twins conversion.)

The spacebar takes you to a 3-D starfield,  the music also starts, 
which  is rather good tracker-type music in four tracks,  at 25khz 
(Or  some  other  very nice clear frequency we  don't  know  about 
yet..)  Presumably  part of the original Amiga demo  methinks..  A 
'TPT'  logo,  (Based  on some R-Type Graphix??) appears,  as  does 
various  information  about the demo,  finally,  for this bit,  the 
'MENTAL  HANGOVER' title-screen is shown.  (With the 3-D starfield 
and tune going all the time..)

Next,  a 3-D sprite chain sears its way across the screen,  then a 
huge  eye  appears  behind  this,   and  the  ever-persistent  3-D 
starfield is still doing its business, pretty good eh? 
 (At  the 16-Bit fair,  it was interesting to see the reactions  of 
Amiga-owners  to  this  demo,  mostly  favourable,  although  some 
commented on a loss of resolution or number of colours in the  STE 
 conversion..)

 Then  the  solid  3-D  raster  coloured  cube  popped  in,  almost 
unannounced  as it were,  then a diamond followed that..  The next 
bit  is  achingly familiar to anyone who has got the  Pixel  Twins 
Stupendous  Demo ,  where the STENCIL VECTORS strut their  stuff... 
More  3-D  solid  shapes which are filled,  not by  simple  single 
colours, or shading, or even stippling or Gourad type shading, but 
by various textured patterns,  including some that looked somewhat 
like  Christmas  wrapping  paper,  or wood,  wallpaper  and  brick 
textures  (On a polyhedral spacecraft?!?!!?!?) Only this  one  had 
the ever-faithful soundtracker routines (and tune) still in place, 
and not a soundchip tune as per the Stupendous Demo..

All over too soon,  as a greets screen appears (mercifully short.) 
Then  to  a  screen with 3-D bobs spewing out of  a  hat,  in  the 
background, a closed door bears the message "Coders at work"..

 The  Final  Bits:-   Some (very little) 3-D  solid,  shaded  vector 
letters scroll diagonally from top right to bottom left of screen, 
something  very  similar  to  the  Overlanders  famous  3-D  solid 
extravaganza  in  the European Demos,  (But only about 10  seconds 
long,  it  seems..)  A Ball or bubble field,  very similar to that 
found in the Union Demo finishes off the demo,  whereupon it wraps 
and starts again...
 
 Ratings:-

Graphix:-   85%  -  A  faithful  copy  (Presumably)  of  the  Amiga 
original,  subject  to any resolution/palette limitations,  raster 
and stencil vectors very nice to look at..

Sonix:-  88% - A very good soundtrack (Again, the original?!), with 
proper  use made of the STE hardware to get decent quality..  Tune 
could  have been longer,  as it 'wraps' before the demo as a whole 
does..

Gee-Whiz:-   80%  - Interesting case,  on the one hand,  a complete 
emulation  of  a whole Amiga demo is a bit unprecedented  (Yes,  I 
know  people like TCB,  TLB and OVR "Take-off" Amiga screens on  a 
regular basis,  but a  Whole  demo??) On the other hand,  apart from 
the stencil vectors,  nothing very new at all here.. ( Just  HOW old 
is the original!?!??)

Overall:-   84%  -  Smooth,   professional,   slick,  one  for  the 
collection, definitely.... Keep up the good work TPT...

King of the STE demos???? 
I  still  think the definitive STE megademo has yet  still  to  be 
written, this equals the previous contender, the Delerious III, as 
each have different strengths and weaknesses..

For  example,  this  one has a much higher standard of  production 
than 'Delerious', and is not prone to crash, or frighten your disk 
drive,  but  I  think it is too short,  a common problem with  STE 
demos  (But slowly getting better..) In some areas,  I would  have 
liked to have seen more, and it seemed to be over too quickly..

'Delerious', (in spite of its awful loader In both reliability and 
time  consumption  fields..) Had more to see and hear,  and had  a 
definite  sense of humour,  lacking a bit from 'Mental  Hangover', 
but was less polished, and seemed unfinished or rushed..

I  sincerly  hope  this is not the end of  the  story,  (I  think, 
somewhere  else,  there  is a column called 'STE-Bitz' whose  main 
subject  is the lack of STE Specific stuff..) But we all  live  in 
hope in the meantime...
