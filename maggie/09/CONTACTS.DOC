reader..)

"Hi,  I'm searching for some contacts to swap some demos and music 
with source code and other (Legal) stuff.."

"If you are interested,  write some words, I also try to make some 
stuff myself but it's not that good. If there is anybody out there 
who can help, please send a note."
