 Or SYNC TRACKER to the Befuddled Masses....

A  Not-Very-Exclusive but hopefully comprehensive review  by  that 
old loony CIH...

We  will now take a short stroll down memory lane,  before zooming 
up  superlative  avenue,  and  puttering  up  and  down  carefully 
constructed  review  boulevard,   this  next  bit  is  pure  self-
indulgence on my part (and it is still three days before I get  my 
hands on the program properly..)

 Life, the SID chip, and Everything.... 

SET  THE  SCENE:-   1985,   Ormskirk,  Lancashire,  England,  I  am 
undergoing higher education and progressive alchohol studies, with 
my  spare  time on the computer (The BBC Model B in  the  library) 
playing ELITE,  the shop has a Commodore 64,  the newest game just 
in,  is RAMBO, by the kings of licenceware, Ocean... Up until that 
moment,  computer games were for playing,  they just loaded in and 
got on with the job... This time was different..

The game started to load,  the RAMBO logo appeared, then the music 
started to play, and what music!! It was a theme written by Martin 
Galway,  and was of a "Surely home computers can't do this sort of 
wonderful stuff, they are cheap and crappy" quality, but yea, they 
could  (Or the Commodore SID chip,  could,  at any rate..) A whole 
symphony stuffed into two minutes, the games-playing fun-box would 
 never be the same again!!!

After  being  rooted to the spot by the unforgettable  audio,  the 
game  loaded  and revealed itself to be an  average-to  reasonable 
blaster, but I returned to the store, several time more that week, 
to make sure that I could believe my ears properly..

(A  one-time friend with a '64 got this game,  and the quality  of 
music  continued to amaze,  the game was one to get just to listen 
to,  the main game had an oriental tune, the high-score tables had 
dark and moody themes, all of them several minutes long..)

(We  later got into some Rob Hubbard stuff,  and ended up  getting 
games  for the quality of the soundtrack..) Funny how  Thrust   gets 
into the conversation at this point..


The  interest  thing spluttered along,  I purchased a strange  and 
rare  8-Bit  computer  shortly  afterwards,  a  beast  called  the 
Enterprise,  (Or  Elan  Enterprise,  also  known  under  the  name 
Mephisto  in  Germany..) This was a funny looking  computer,  with 
64/128k memory, a futuristic 'partly-melted' look to the keyboard, 
which  seemed  to  anticipate the rounded  features  of  the  Sega 
Megadrive to some extent...

(It  was  actually purchased from a shop,  Blue Chip Computers  in 
Liverpool , owned by one, Gary Bracey, before his involvement with 
Ocean!!!  Talking to him at that time, he seemed to know everybody 
important  in the 'Industry' even then - This was  when  Liverpool 
had  a  lot of high profile softco's such  as  IMAGINE,  BUG-BYTE, 
SOFTWARE PROJECTS, ODIN COMPUTERS, etc...)

It  also had a claimed graphic resolution of 678 x 512 (Which  was 
not  possible on the 64k models..) A very good  and  comprehensive 
BASIC interpretor (If a bit slow..) and a sound chip which was not 
quite on the same level as the SID chip, but certainly better than 
the  YM2149  in common use in the Amstrads and  Spectrums  of  the 
 day...  (The  graphix chip called NICK,  the sound chip went under 
the name of DAVE..)

The machine suffered from a dreadfully long pre-launch delay,  and 
never really took off,  the company died,  a year after going into 
production..  (According to my information, there is still a user-
group,  here  in the UK..) As far as I was concerned,  the lack of 
games at this stage meant that SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE,  and that 
took  the form of stumbling first efforts with the BASIC,  leading 
to  tentative  exploration of the soundchip,  (A  neglected  area, 
people  were much more interested in the custom  graphics  chip..) 
Eventually  to the first music or sound demo,  (Called MUSAK  ONE, 
very original huh!!)

Things  really  took  off with MUSAK II,  with  some  stunneroonie 
effects from the DAVE chip,  including a really graunchy and dirty 
electric guitar that I don't think you could ever get from the SID 
chip,  the IEUG (Independent User group) pronounced it GOOD, there 
were  even  intentions to use it at the 1986 PCW  show,  on  their 
small stand (with 200 watt speakers) (I don't know if it was...)

I got as far as MUSAK III,  with a fourth in preparation,  when I 
got my first ST in early '87..

Then, any production stopped, the Enterprise was slowly dying, the 
ST  offered  far more,  as a vastly enhanced fun-box,  I had  just 
started work,  after leaving college,  and that was taking up more 
time.. So that was that, for the early days...

(Phew!!  that's  that bit of the autobiography out of the way,  as 
they say!!)



(I  hope  you  don't  mind the preceding  bit,  or  think  it  too 
unlikely,  these  things really happened,  so we now go on towards 
the present day...)
 
The  ST was really 'Nothing doing' musically,  in the early  days, 
then  some  kind people called The Exceptions  changed  that  with 
their  'Little  Colour  Demo's',  swiftly followed by  the  B.I.G. 
Demo..  HEY  WOW!!  Hundreds  of  tunes that almost sound  like  a 
Commodore 64, and DIGISYNTH!!

We move swiftly on,  to the Union demo,  with more digisynth,  and 
lovely clear sample work,  to the end of 1989,  and the release of 
the  CUDDLY  DEMO's and at the first Computer  Shopper  Show,  the 
first available composition program, QUARTET..

This  was  a(nother)  revelation,   the  first  four-track  sample 
composer, so I started again, sort of...

THe  old  ST was coming apart,  eventually refusing to SAVE to  or 
FORMAT  a  disk,  so  we now leap forward to June 1990,  with  the 
purchase of the STE,  my present machine at the spring ATARI show, 
also  the  release  of  the first  edition  of  TLB  MAGGIE,  with 
celebrity appearances by the Lost Boys.  So I got going on QUARTET 
again,  then  the first Module composer TCB TRACKER was announced, 
this  was  the subject of my first major review in the  third  and 
fourth  issues  of  Maggie  (An  inadvertant  two-parter,  as  the 
original 'improved' article was virused out of existence on Mike's 
hard disk..)

TCB TRACKER got rave reviews that it would not justify today,  now 
knowing  much  more about the subject,  but it was a good move  by 
MPH, and was quite happy to have several tunes tapped out on it by 
me...  It  was superseded by a mix of public domain trackers which 
were  produced  to emulate the Amiga originals much  more  closely 
than TCB tracker could..

NOISETRACKER  in  it's 1.5 incarnation was quite a  good  product, 
including a basic sample editor,  apart from its habit of chewing-
up directories on disk,  EQUINOXE tracker, had fewer features, but 
was  more  stable  in the load/save dept,  (And  could  emulate  a 
 membrane  keyboard???  it did not have the most responsive  mouse-
click  ever..)  ESION tracker,  the first STE-only tracker  was  a 
pleasure  to work with,  but only had a maximum 32kb sample length 
to work with and no sample editor..

Until AUDIO SCULPTURE,  this is what I have been using,  will this 
now all change with the arrival of the new WUNDER PROGRAM???

(I  think I am going to have to do a lot of this from  memory,  as 
there  are still major difficulties in getting hold of  this..  We 
are  now at the stage where one of my ST-owning friends  has  this 
program,  it  helps  that he works for a computer store,  but even 
their distributors, Leisuresoft are having problems..)

AUDIO     SCULPTURE     is    yet     another     sound     module 
composer/sequencer/editor program, but attempts to take the number 
of features further than ever before....

You may recall a P.D.  demo version,  which was released a year or 
so, ago, this being very much an early 'rough' version.. The final 
finished  model  is now commercially 'available' (I use  the  term 
available advisedly..) and has several features incorporated as  a 
result of suggestions made by people over a number of months..

The  PD version is only a pale shadow of the fully-grown  program, 
since  then,  several more output modes,  including all the common 
cartridges,  STE DMA stereo,  both 12.5 khz, and 50khz, also there 
is  an  optional  mono  16 Bit  STE  mode  for  especially  daring 
individuals with soldering irons...  Also, a decent sample editor, 
vector synthesis to create samples, speech synthesis, and even the 
possibility of hand-drawing wave-forms to create new sounds!!

So,  in  more  detail,  the proggy autoboots and loads up a moving 
background  demoscreen which looks suspiciously like the  kind  of 
thing produced by the French group NEXT, which is indeed the case, 
the main body of the program written by the two members of Syncron 
Assembly..
 
The   main   menu   screen  is  one   of   the   more   attractive 
Soundtrackers  around,  several rather 'arty' icons are clicked on 
to  get  to the different options in the program..  The method  of 
note  entry  remains  the  same  as  in  most  of  the  Amiga-type 
noisetrackers, four parallel tracks, where notes/hex control codes 
for different effects are entered to produce a sound MODule..

There is also the option of entering a screen where the tracks are 
represented  by  musical staves and traditional  notation,  as  in 
'Quartet',  it  is also possible to use this score editor to enter 
notes if the matrix-patterns are not to your taste..

As mentioned previously,  there are several output modes,  ranging 
from  the deathly but ok if you need spare CPU time 10khz  tin-can 
YM2149,  to  the  rather deluxe STE 50khz,  taking in things  like 
Stereo  Replay,  the  Monster  stereo  cart,  and the  MV16  carts 
in-between.. With 'Sync, it is far better to have either an STE or 
one of the popular output cartridges,  as the 'default' quality is 
pretty, well, basic..

The  STE  modes include an options menu for  volume  (overall  and 
left/right  channels) and bass and treble levels to  be  adjusted, 
the  50khz mode uses quantized frequency control with the loss  of 
portamento (Smooth glide between two notes..)

The quality at 50khz is certainly good enough to annoy most  Amiga 
owners.. Does your  Games Machine  handle 50-khz?!?!!?

I would think it does not....

The next major feature of this program are the sample editing  and 
creation  (!)  facilities  which  are  not  found  in  any   other 
affordable music program (If you don't include 'Quartet' and their 
programs are spread out onto three disks anyway..) The program has 
a  64k  buffer for incoming samples from a Replay  or  MasterSound 
cartridge,  or alternatively,  samples from within the MOD that is 
 in the machine can be plucked out from obscurity and worked upon..

And  that  is before you decide to scribble in the  sample  editor 
buffer  with  the  mouse,  and  a sort of scratchy  click  is  the 
result  normally,  but patience and persistence will probably  pay 
off with something resembling a nice sound..

You  can select which  part  of the sample to edit,  if space allows 
in  the  buffer,  you can cut and overlay different sections of  a 
sample  to obtain 'echoey' effects,  for example,  or even combine 
several different samples together..  It is possible to set a loop 
point,  reverse a sample, filter it down, increase or decrease the 
amplitude  of  a sample,  and fade it..  There are other functions 
buried  within the program,  but it will take a good while to find 
them all..

A  prime  example of this is the Sound  Synthesis  section,  which 
generates  waveforms  to  create  samples,   which  is  a  process 
involving a stiff read of the manual to take all of the  (Several) 
necessary steps,  but again this is a good one to play around with 
to see what intriguing noises result..

The Speech-synth is much easier,  once accessed,  just type in the 
word or phrase (Max:- 20 to 30 characters) and press 'Enter',  the 
speech  sample is then created in the sample buffer..  The quality 
is  'constipated  cyborg' unfortunately,  but these can be  worked 
upon like other samples, again persistence is the key word here..

Unlike  most  of  the Public domain sequencers,  there is  a  MIDI 
option on Audio Sculpture,  (So it is damnable rotten luck I don't 
have  an  electronic keyboard..) This incorporates MIDI  IN,  MIDI 
OUT,  and  Channel  flow,  and  can  be customised  to  suit  your 
particular requirements..

On the matrix entry editor,  all of the standard Noisetracker-type 
control  codes  are supported,  Portamento up and down (Except  on 
50khz STE..),   Vibrato,  Volume slide up and down,  tremelo,  set 
 volume, break pattern, jump to position, etc..

The  package  comes as three disks,  one with the main program,  a 
disk  of  MODs  and  samples,  and also  source  code  for  replay 
routines,  for  assembler,  GFA  and STOS basics,  the replay code 
plays back at 10khz,  and 29% of a standard ST's CPU time. It also 
includes  all  the  sound  carts  mentioned  previously,  and  STE 
support, and does have volume control, and a choice of absolute or 
quantised frequency..


 To  Conclude:-   This  is  probably  the  best-featured  and   most 
versatile  tracker  on the ST/STE to date,  and can even give  the 
Amiga  Community severe trauma..  It is one of the few programs to 
start to stretch the STE,  and is worth looking at, for that point 
alone..  It  suitably  stands aside from the mass of P.D.  Tracker 
programs by virtue of the extra features, source code etc..
 
But  I  would like to mention a couple of little things  before  I 
go..

 Firstly,  I  have been advised that people with 512k machines will 
only  have around 23k free memory to play about with !!  Clearly a 
One meg machine is the  minimum  useful set up,  more than this will 
be  needed if you are serious about setting up for 16 Bit  output, 
and  more memory is always a good thing in any case where  samples 
are concerned.

 Secondly,  this program should be available from retailers who use 
Leisuresoft  Distributors,  in  practice,  it  has been  extremely  
difficult to get the program from anywhere..

'Sync' was launched at the 16 Bit fair,  last July,  on a combined 
Eclipse/Expose Software Co stand..  A number of orders were taken, 
and  it  appears not fulfilled since then,  there being an air  of 
confusion over what to do by the people concerned,  this obviously 
being their first show in the UK..
 
Since then, MPH were supposesd to distribute 'Sync', but were only 
able  to  get very limited supplies from  Expose,  The  subsequent 
collapse of MPH left a lot of people up sh*t creek..

Then  Leisuresoft  distributed the program,  but  their  immediate 
supply  seems  to  be limited to about one copy  (Which  has  been 
borrowed  for  the  purpose of this  review,) the  future  outlook 
remains very uncertain..

Can  I really recommend a program that you cannot buy???  There is 
apparently  a  hacked  version floating around  now...   Very  sad 
really...
