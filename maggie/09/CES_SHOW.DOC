 
               The C.E.S. Show, The show that never was...

A CIH inside report....

Cast  your  mind  to traditional September pursuits,  the  end  of 
Summer,  the  hordes  of glistening 'Back To School' displays,  in 
just about every shop in the land (With the Christmas  decorations 
waiting  for  their turn shortly after,  no doubt..) And there  is 
always the 'Big' Computer show of the year,  in the UK,  September 
is ALL ABOUT huge queues at Earls Court, Goddammit!!

But not this time,  the 'Mega-Event' Show, for reasons still being 
sought after, rather abruptly became trade only, toward the end of 
August,  there  was NO WAY in for Joe Public (This was not a great 
loss, as I will explain..)

But  having  obtained a complimentary ticket,  and suitably  armed 
with (Someone elses) business cards, it was off to London to visit 
the  Ex-Greatest Show on Earth...  The first thing that struck  me 
was,  the  baton  of an over-eager security guard??  Er no,  it was 
VERY  VERY  VERY  quiet indeed,  the show itself was held  in  the 
recently  refurbished  Earls  Court II,  there was  at  least  one 
punter,  who  was unaware of the 'trade only' nature of the  show, 
trying (and dismally failing) to get in..

A  very  long walk around the Earls Court site,  got me  to  Earls 
Court II, and, from there, the only way was........

Through  the doors actually,  the second thing that struck me  was 
the  acres of floorspace,  no chance to practice my dirtiest hand-
to-hand  combat  tactics on the shell-suited masses,  what a  nice 
change... However, those same missing crowds are the life and soul 
of  a  good  show,  are  they  not?  So this was  a  very  subdued 
gathering..

The  first 'game' was to visit as many of the  non-software  trade 
 and  retail stands,  with the really attractive PR girls on  them, 
and  arrange for their reps to visit the person whose name  I  had 
taken (Who is a Computer store manager - Hi Nathan..Only joking..) 
to try and sell things that they had already got, and did not want 
any more of...

The second source of amusement was to play 'Spot the stands  which 
were  built for the consumer show,  before they pulled the plug on 
it..'  The  clear  winner  here,   being  Virgin/Mastertronic  (Or 
Sega/Virgin/Mastertronic??)  who had a very nice expensive  stand, 
with JIMMY WHITE'S 3-D SNOOKER, and ROLLING RONNY, to name but two 
games,  also,  ROOM  13,  a  sort  of  Secret  Service  'Cover-Up' 
simulator..





Ocean  came second,  with what looked like a semi-completed stand, 
with the usual sort of thing, Imminent licences include TERMINATOR 
II,  THE  SIMPSONS  -  BART  vs THE SPACE  MUTANTS,  HUDSON  HAWK, 
ROBOCOP  III,  SMASH  T.V.  (a Williams coin-op,  not a film) and a 
host of others, including BATMAN on a budget release... I caught a 
glimpse  of Ocean supremo Garry Bracey,  leaving with suitcases in 
hand,  and  thought  that  SOMEONE had the right idea  about  this 
show..

I  called  in at the ATARI stand (Naturally) and  this  was  quite 
small,  and  totally  concerned  with the  coming  (Xmas)  seasons 
marketing for various ST packs, and also the LYNX, I took the time 
off to chat to one of the very attractive PR girls (How do they do 
it??)  about  various things,  including MAGGIE,  which she seemed 
pleased  to  hear about...  They kept their lips sealed about  the 
various  new  machines,  but  it  seems that there  are  some  new 
launches, probably for September next year, in the pipeline, for 
something by way of a new enhanced ST/E..

 I also visited the arch-rival's (Commodore) stand, they were 
pushing this years 'product' as well, but whilst there, I spotted 
CDTV in operation with the latest demos, including the new 
PSYGNOSIS CD-ROM game, I told you about in an earlier issue, this 
moves and looks very good, everything being 100% digitised, it 
remains to be seen what the playability is like though....

Also  running,  were Gremlin's forthcoming LOTUS TURBO ESPRIT  II, 
which  looked  very  promising,   and  various  MICROPROSE  games, 
including  the  ST  version of MICROPROSE GOLF,  and  a  solid-3-D 
FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX game,  (With a really naff video by someone 
doing  "Murray  Walker"  impressions) Also,  the P.C.  preview  of 
GUNSHIP  2000,  and  several,  curling at the edges in a dangerous 
fashion, sandwiches and nibbles..

The  rebuilt Activision had a large stand,  with several  machines 
running  HUNTER,   and  F14,   Domark  had  MIG  29  SUPERFULCRUM, 
PITFIGHTER, WORLD CUP RUGBY, and RACE DRIVING...

There were several non-ST points of interest, including WING 
COMMANDER II, (Fast, colourful, and really blocky close up..) and 
a Sega Megadrive version of Turrican (Unplayable, with the awful 
joypad supplied with that machine...) But a lot of people, 
including US Gold, Psgnosis, Mirrorsoft, Electronic Arts, and 
Core design stayed away, these were showing at the nearby 
Gloucester Hotel, and had boycotted the original consumer show-
to-be, on the grounds of excessive cost... The generally 
expressed view seems to be that the consumer show failed because 
of the mass pull-outs by several big names, and that the 
organisers were charging too much..

It  would  seem  that  there is to  be  no  replacement  show  for 
September,  indeed, there is the ludicrous position of there being 
TWO trade shows for next year....



 SHOPPER SHOW, anyone?????

Certainly, it seems something went very badly wrong, in the period 
immediately  before the show,  you may remember that the CES  show 
has only been in its present format for two or so years,  after it 
was  rescued from collapse by EMAP,  when exhibitors threatened to 
pull  out  for very similar reasons that time  (Greedy  Organisers 
just out to line their pockets at the expense of everyone..Etc)

It  is  also strange that some parts of the  industry  consider  a 
September  consumer show an 'Anacronism' (Belonging to  the  past) 
whilst  others state that the industry is not 'Mature' enough  for 
this sort of show.... (Duuuurrrrrrrr whats going on guys???)

Also,  by  virtue of it being a trade show (Over 18's) none of the 
usual people who make these things really worthwhile,  were there, 
so it was a very quiet, bland, subdued, and colourless experience. 
It  may as well have not taken place (Indeed some people think  it 
didn't..)

Will there ever be anything like this again?? Who cares???

You may be interested to hear of some of the strange literature I 
picked up, this includes things like Future Publishing's promotion 
packs (For potential advertisers) for both ST Format and New 
Computer Express.. The copy for the NCE pack goes something 
like... "IF YOU WERE SELLING CHOCOLATE, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO GET 
TO THE CHOCOHOLICS!!" ("Chocoholics" being the sort of avid, 
interested reader/user who buys 'Express..) 

Yes, quite.......

And I think, that is most definitely it....
