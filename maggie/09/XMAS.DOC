(And written in Oct '91...)

So,  another year closes,  what happens now, what happened then??? 
can  anybody  tell me,  as I am so confused,  and so very easy  to 
confuse... Oh well, I suppose I had better have a go myself...

FIRSTLY:-

          WHATEVER HAPPENED TO........
    ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
By Jade.D. Hack..

NUMBER  ONE,  AUDIO  SCULPTURE,  otherwise known as SYNC  TRACKER, 
otherwise known as "I put my order in for it in July and still  no 
response.." Otherwise known as "WE ARE SELLING IT,  BUT THERE IS A 
THREE  WEEK  (plus) WAITING LIST FOR IT....." Otherwise  known  as 
"Where did you get your review copy from???"

It  was launched in July,  at the 16Bit fair to much acclaim,  but 
then dropped out of sight,  efforts by distributors, dealers, Air-
Sea Rescue,  the SAS,  the publishers of SMASH HITS, and the Queen 
Mother  (Gawd  bless  you Ma'am..) have all failed  to  produce  a 
sighting. It is hoped that an expedition mounted by the management 
of a well-known instant mash/oven chip manufacturers will  produce 
a 'result'... The MAGGIE hotlines remain open for a first sighting 
of this wondrous tracker...

 But   seriously,   you  do  wonder  what  is  going  on  with  the 
distribution (Or lack,  thereof) of one of the hottest ST software 
properties of 1991,  THIS IS 1991,  and anybody who studied at the 
CLIVE  SINCLAIR  School  of  business  management  is  now  firmly 
established in the gutter where they belong..

Maybe  the kind people of Syncron Assembly would like  to  explain 
their  position,  and brief us on any difficulties they have  been 
having, as that is what MAGGIE is for??? (Oh yes, what happened to 
the  orders  taken at the 16Bit fair in July '91,  and  still  not 
fulfilled!!)

Anyway,  on to NUMBER TWO,  EPIC, which is coming up to it's third 
(or  fourth?)  year  in production,  and coming up  to  the  first 
anniversary  of full-page advertising (Thanks Ocean!) Is a  launch 
on  the current generation of 16 Bit machines likely???  We should 
be told...

NUMBER  THREE is another soundtracker prog,  whatever happened  to 
the  UBISOFT tracker that was supposed to utilise  the  marvellous 
multi  voiced  properties of the MV16 Cartridge??

Was  it ever released?  Was it a 'low profile' release,  and there 
are  now about three copies,  gathering dust at the Ubisoft Sahara 
Desert branch office, again, can we hear something soon..

NUMBER FOUR (and five,  and afterwards...) Games like,  DUSTER,  a 
pesticide, 3-D polygon based, strategy type thing from Mirrorsoft, 
which  was  getting  pre-release publicity about  this  time  last 
year..  RAMROD from Gremlin????  ELITE II??????  The new Carebears 
Demo, otherwise known as, "Oh yes there is, Oh no there isn't.."
Thalion's  NO SECOND PRIZE ?!?!?!?!?!!??!  (The 'Second Prize'  in 
this case being a copy of the finished game...)

         ============================================
                 F A U X - P A S - C I T Y....
         ============================================
 
Yet another Jade.D. Hack special...

Who is doing what to whom, and for how much???

Firstly,   where   are  all  the  self-appointed  'Public  Domain' 
correspondants  from the mainstream computer press  coming  from?? 
QWe are firstly advised that the LostBoys latest,  OOH CRIKEY, WOT 
A SCORCHER! Megademo is for 1mb STE's only (New Computer Express), 
but  I  tricked it into running on a friends STFM  by  the  simple 
expedient  of putting the disc in the drive slot,  and turning  on 
the power to the computer!!

Secondly,  about  the  same time,  the CareBears became a  British 
demo crew.. Errrrrrr.....

About  a  couple  of weeks later in the  'Express,  the  CareBears 
'Cuddly  Demos' were launched as a timely riposte to the TLB  'Ooh 
Crikey, demo... Uuuuummmm.....

Handy that,  TCB having a time-machine,  and the ability to change 
their nationality at will...

If  they keep up this sloppy standard of reporting,  NEW  COMPUTER 
EXPRESS deserve to go out of print.... (Oh, they have, it seems...)

Meanwhile,  the November edition of THE ONE also reviewed the 'Ooh 
Crikey' demo, describing the Lost Boys 'Typical Swedish Humour'...

Oh dear.... Can it get better/"Better", watch this space...


WELL YES IT CAN!!!


COMMODORE have kindly donated, at no extra cost, the winning entry 
to  FAUX  PAS CITY,  the AMIGA PLUS (Otherwise known as  the  'STE 
 Amiga??' Just in time for Christmas,  the new model Amiga features 
some extra graphics modes,  a new Workbench, and most importantly, 
enough incompatabilities to ensure it does not work properly  with 
a lot of earlier stuff, just like the STE, two years ago...

I  wonder if this machine will get as much negative  publicity  as 
the  STE  did from the mainstream computer  press????  Watch  this 
space!!!

If  this is not enough,  Commodore are falling out of favour  with 
the  retailers,  with  a  new  and restrictive  return  of  faulty 
machines  policy  (Mustafa word with Nathan about the  details  of 
this  sometime..) So in many cases,  they cannot 'Afford to  stock 
Amigas'...

Before  we  leave the city limits of ol' Faux-Pas,  an  honourable 
mention  to Atari for the worlds first LIMITED  EDITION  COMPUTER, 
the 1mb STE FAMILY CURRICULUM PACK, where three months stock  sold 
out in as many weeks, here in the UK. This is all very encouraging 
on the one hand, but are Atari going to run out of stocks over the 
Christmas period yet again, oh dear...


                 THE SPORTS WALKMAN - WHY?????

(This is looking more and more like ROTTSPOTT, don't you think??)

The "Sports-Walkman" in a brightly coloured, waterproof version of 
the personal hi-fi, which set me thinking...

WHAT USE IS A WATERPROOF PERSONAL STEREO????

For  listening  to Jacque Cousteau's greatest hits  whilst  scuba-
diving?

For those unco-ordinated people who cannot be trusted not to  fall 
in the river when going to the shops??
 
In a sudden tidal wave overwhelming everything situation,  you can 
still have music???

In case the worst case scenario for the 'greenhouse effect'  comes 
true (Sea levels rise 200ft/70 metres - see above...)

To take with you into the shower,  (I suppose, it beats the danger 
from electrocution posed by a mains-driven hi-fi...)

And  then it turns out that 'Waterproof' in this case,  means "Not 
very  waterproof at all actually" the best it can cope with,  is a 
light shower or accidental spillage quickly wiped off...


Just who is kidding who, as they say...

About this time last year, in a column called ROTTSPOT, I reviewed 
the  year (1990) and looked to the year ahead (This year  dummy!), 
what happened? you may ask...

Indeed,  where did this year go, I predicted some of the following 
would  happen (From memory),  There would be a new  super-console, 
the  possibilty  of  other new ST-related  hardware,  better  P.C. 
emulators,  more  software using 'Double-sided' discs as standard, 
concerns about piracy reaching new peaks,  the growth of consoles, 
and more STE-specific support...

This is what actually happened:-

NEW SUPER-CONSOLE? Well yes and no, The PANTHER came and went (See 
elsewhere  in  Maggie) and the next "secret" project,  the  JAGUAR 
even-more-super-console  is on the cards,  for a release in  1992, 
this machinme is supposedly 64-bit,  and at least as revolutionary 
as the original VCS was, back in 1978.. Wait and see.

OTHER ST-RELATED HARDWARE, again, yes and no, I managed to mention 
 the imminent arrival of the 16mhz 68000 based Mega-STE.. It is now 
a year later,  and supplies are only just reaching the shops!  Get 
your  act together Atari!!  The ST-PAD and NOTEBOOK computers  are 
not yet due for release, the news on the 'enhanced STE' or STEE is 
even vaguer..

BETTER  P.C.  EMULATORS,  as  I  write,  the  Vortex ATonce  386SX 
emulator  is  being released for a sum of œ299,  based on  a  CMOS 
80386  16mhz  chip,  with  a maths coprocessor for  an  additional 
œ129..  This was previously available for Mega STE's only, but can 
now be fitted to any machine with 1MB upwards.. This would be best 
justified  for  a large system with plenty of memory and  a  Hard-
drive,  for  owners  of  more basic ST's,  it may be an  expensive 
exercise..  We  would  also like to know the following,  is  there 
provision for 1.44MB HD floppys, are there decent expansion slots, 
so  you could plug in a 256-colour VGA card,  and monitor (At  the 
expense of the ST's casing??) all interesting stuff..

MORE SOFTWARE USING DOUBLE-SIDED DISCS,  this has taken off, as it 
should,  surely  most old single sided ST's have been upgraded  by 
now? The majority of games are now on D/S format, there are even a 
growing  number of games which need 1MB of memory,  such as MONKEY 
ISLAND,  SILENT SERVICE II,  IMMORTAL,  POPULOUS II,  and BIRDS OF 
PREY, with more to follow.. This trend is to be welcomed

CONCERNS ABOUT PIRACY reaching new peaks,  well,  not really, this 
may  well be due to the fact that many software houses are not  so 
keen on developing on the ST, and often only release games if they 
have  done  well on other formats...  We remain grateful  for  the 
continued lack of dismal ELSPA-style advertisments this year..


It seems that publicity for piracy has taken a back seat this year 
(There  seems  to be a lot of re-releases and budget  pricing  for 
some reason,  as well,  and a lot of hot new software due out this 
year is still in development..)

 THE  GROWTH  OF (other than Atari) CONSOLES,  yes,  but not at the 
expense of Home Computers, as once feared, The SEGA MEGADRIVE, has 
sold well,  as has the Nintendo GAMEBOY, and ATARI LYNX handhelds, 
and  other Sega and Nintendo products,  the Sega Megadrive remains 
the  state of the art,  as the Super-Famicon is not due for launch 
here  until  late 1992,  or even 1993.  Providing Atari get  their 
fingers  out,  they  could clean up in Europe next year,  with  the 
JAGUAR,  if it is even half as good as is rumoured.. It has been a 
good  year for the LYNX and LYNX II too..  Atari has got smart  by 
repositioning  the  STE  as  an  all-purpose  home  machine,   the 
Educational FAMILY CURRICULUM pack sold three months stock in  the 
summer,  in as many weeks!  This could be a key to survival of the 
ST next year..

THE GROWTH OF STE-SPECIFIC SOFTWARE,  what happened??  The release 
rate for STE-Specific, or even enhanced material is about the same 
as  it  was  in early 1990,  IE:- not a lot,  even in  the  public 
domain..  As  all  new machines now sold are STE's will  this  get 
better?? See 1992 to find out!!!


 THE REVENGE OF THE RETURN OF.....

                 (U N) D E A D  -  C E L E B R I T I E S!!!!!
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 A.K.A.
        THE NEW LOOK STIFF ZONE.....
 
Yes!  No  sooner  had  I announced the death of  this  column  for 
various  reasons,  then  we are kicking off again with an  all-new 
star cast!!!!!!!

The  pride  of  place going to MPH  Computers,  who  unfortunately 
ceased trading in November this year, the major reason given being 
a  failure  on the part of the major distributers  to  handle  MPH 
products  such  as the TCB Tracker and  Monster  Stereo  Cartridge 
properly,  A.N. Cool, is puportedly looking for a new distributer 
 to  handle TCB Tracker version 2.0,  the first news we have had on 
this  mythical product this year!!  MPH were also having  problems 
with delivery of a certain French Module composition program  with 
excellent features and a dodgy manual, deliveries being delayed by 
weeks,  and  many orders remaining unfulfilled at the time of  the 
'Crash.'

The  future  of  their new Sampler  cartridge  remains  uncertain, 
refunds  for unfulfilled orders are taking place,  any credit card 
orders  were not debited..  A sad end to a genuinely likeable  and 
friendly company...

(Second  place  has  to go to the first  draft  of  this  article, 
originally  a 'standalone' article which got accidentally  deleted 
last Sunday, Oh Shit....)

Some Journalistic 'Goodbyes,  NEW COMPUTER EXPRESS, the last semi-
decent weekly mag (But with some awful gaffes on the ST Demo scene 
-  See earlier in this article..) Some clues to what was going  to 
happen  could be found in changes made in Early Sept 1991,  when a 
Tri-Format  coverdisk  was  added,  and a  new  trade  advertising 
campaign  was  undertaken  (See  my end  notes  on  the  CES  show 
Article..)  This  did not work,  so 'Express was dropped from  the 
Future Publishing range of titles in October,  the low circulation 
(Only  20,000  readers against ST Format's 70,000-odd)  being  the 
reason given....

Also  the  entire Newsfield chain which featured a  number  of  ZX 
Spectrum,  Commodore 64,  and Console Maggies went out of business 
rather suddenly, (Fortunately, no ST titles..) The one publication 
COMPUTER GAMES MONTHLY which was halfway to being called a  proper 
maggie went over to a console-only format some months ago..  So no 
sad loss there..

Although,  not properly 'dead' in the accepted sense,  an honorary 
mention to the LOST BOYS, whose superb 'OOH CRIKEY WOT A SCORCHER' 
megademo was their last,  TLB are now joining the ranks of TEX and 
 TCB as famous 'dead' crews who make occasional guest  appearances, 
but we wonder if they can be tempted out of retirement..

(Question:-  How  can  you  tell a crew is  about  to  go  out  of 
production permanently??

Answer:-  After  doing their 'Last' demo,  they take on three  new 
members and announce an 'Autumn Blockbuster Megademo'!!!!)

A STRANGE OLD YEAR:-

1991  was a year were some things came and went,  other things  we 
are still waiting for...

After  ULM and SYNTAX TERROR,  there was nothing noteworthy on the 
Demo scene, until TLB released 'Ooh Crikey, Wot a Scorcher' in the 
Summer!!  But  this disk of delights was almost worth the waiting, 
with  the  unforgettable 'Chainsaw massacre' of  a  Carebear,  the 
stunning fractal fly-around main menu, the facility for the little 
guy  flying the spaceship to get out and take a leak!  The 'Aciid' 
demo with the long German name, and a host of others.... The whole 
disk  was  a  superb  demonstration of  the  coder's  art,  almost 
certainly the best demo of 1991...

A worthy second place went to the INNER CIRCLE's THINGS NOT TO  DO 
demo,  a series of short and bloodsplattered animations, very sick 
and funny, a new mega-demo is due from them sometime soon...


Commercial  software  had  it's high spots,  with the  release  of 
TURRICAN II,  a superb sequel to the brilliant original, there was 
also  the  very  playable  HUNTER..   Here  too,  was  the  flawed 
masterpiece  MIDWINTER II,  a classic case of over-extension on  a 
512k machine,  and a whole load of dross as well..  The worst game 
it  was my dipleasure to review,  was HYDRA,  a kind of boat-racer 
with  very  sickly sprite definition,  on the other hand,  there's 
MOONSHINE RACERS, or.....
 
We  have also seen MAGGIE move over to Germany,  and join up  with 
Delta-Force, the most noteworthy issue of 1991 being issue 5, with 
two superb intro's by Sub-Humans in Turkey, and Chris of ULM, this 
can  only  be  topped by the forthcoming  issue  (nine)  with  the 
changes  being  made  by Delta-Force (Issue 8  was  the  first  to 
feature  screenshots  of games,  the code to do this  having  been 
present  since  issue four!!) There still remains the  mystery  of 
what  happened  to issue six,  this being an 'Unofficial' or  joke 
production, was this done???

It has also been a good year for Jeff Minter's Llamasoft, with the 
successful  debut of the licenceware system of releases,  firstly, 
with  Llamatron,  and hopefully with a new release due soon,  of a 
revamped 'Revenge of the Mutant Camels'.. Work is in progress on a 
new generation Lightsynth, way ahead of Trip-A-Tron, and hopefully 
some JAGUAR development work.. Next year, may be Jeff's best yet..
Let's hope so..

THE END:-

(There is now, at least one copy of Audio Sculpture in Northampton 
as of the 10/12/91!! Review to follow ASAP!! - Wotta wait!!)

The Real endpiece:-

 I am driving GAVIN,  otherwise known as 'Watch your wallet',  also 
known  as  'That  Geordie person',  one of the last  of  the  old-
fashioned computerphobes to town, a discussion follows...

GAV:- "It's a pity about Gorbachev being given the push,  I almost 
feel  sorry for him,  looks like a return to good old  personality 
politics with Boris Yeltsin.."

ME:- "You mean like Richard Nixon??"

GAV:- "No, Adolf Hitler!! "
 
OH DEAR!!!!

                 HAVE A CHILLING NEW YEAR!!!!!! - CHRIS....
