Look mum! I can use SEKA, TETRAPACK and DMS! (Next week I'm learning

(I've got a mate who can do fantastically dull psuedo house music on 
NoiseTracker, and another mate is really amazing at doing 
uninteresting bas-relief metallic logos on Dpaint - We're going to 
call ourselves WetDream Design, and do a game for Psygnosis and 
they'll pay us œ7500000 and we'll get our photos ridiculed in Zero 
and then we're going to do Soopa Fannycon games and charge more than 
the national debt of Brazil and after that it's virtual reality and 
I actually SAW Andrew Braybrook at the PC Show and he actually SPOKE 
to me and we had this really good conversation and I told him all
about how crap Rainbow Islands is and how he should have written it 
using Seka and used hardware sprites for the scrolling background 
and when I asked him why he left out the bit on the arcade machine 
when you first turn it on and some gliched graphics come up for a
thirtieth of a second - which really contributes to the gameplay - 
 he said 'Why don't you shut the f**k up and leave me alone, you 
irritating little t*at' and I knew he was just saying that cos he 
knew I was right and how much better than him I am and I bet he's 
never written a parallax sprite starfield sine scrolly bob demo 
with soundtracker music in his life and I bet he wouldn't even know 
how and he's rubbish anyway you know I actually saw one BNE in his 
code that could have been a BNE.S and I nearly wet myself I mean how 
can he call himself a programmer when he obviously isn't nearly as 
good as me.. etc,etc,etc,etc,etc)

Anyway I must go now as my mum says my rusks are getting soggy...

 Yes kids, It's *PROGRAMMER'S EGO* time!

Other games I've written: (the list gets longer!)
Double Dragon I (Amiga,ST,Amstrad CPC)
Double Dragon II (Amiga,ST,Amstrad) (Aargh! Endless beat-em-ups!)
Shinobi (Amstrad)
Block Racer (Amiga,ST)
ESWAT (Spectrum!)
Line Of Fire (Amiga,ST)
Rotox (Amiga,ST)
Fly Spy (Amstrad)
The Islands of Dr.Destructo (64)
U.C.M. (64) (barf)

Utilities,etc:
Zap (Amiga)
Cyclone (Amiga)
TimeWarp turbo loader (Amstrad)
Invade-a-load (64)
+various other bits'n'pieces & in-house stuff.


Right, that's the programography over with, now the customary 
rubbish that I sometimes put in the startup-sequence to amuse you 
pirates before you get down to the 5-minute job of cracking the game 
(see also Line of Fire!)

Incidentally, I gave up protecting games seriously after I spent a 
week doing the protection for Shinobi and Double Dragon II on the 
Amiga, which was (and I say so myself), pretty bloody good.. even if 
Weetabix did eventually crack DD2 (by  the way, I never did find out 
how long it took you!)

The way I look at it, the better the protection, the greater the 
challenge, and although it would be fun if protection could adapt 
itself to what the cracker is doing (like a game of chess), as it is 
the whole game is a bit one-sided. I mean, whatever I do for 
protection, once I've done it, it's cast in stone, and as it is 
impossible to cover every one of the bizarre things you lot will try, 
eventually a game will get cracked, so why bother in the first place?  
I don't agree with piracy, but as in-game protection is just 
providing you lot with some amusement over a boring weekend, I don't 
bother much any more..

I daresay some people still think that it's possible to do 'pirate-
proof' protection, but personally, after DD2 (which really did have 
some bloody neat ideas in it), I don't!

Another problem is that when I do a really neat disk format, that, 
say, gives you 6.5k a track and is well hard to copy, the *$#?**!ing 
duplicators can't duplicate it!  Kind of defeats the object really!

Any road up, on this game I'm reasonably pleased with the interrupt-
driven disk loader; everyone else did it ages ago - so did I, but 
 that sort of loading is not really suitable for most types of games:  
you need dynamic memory-allocation and multi-tasking uncrunch routines 
for a start, and then you run into all sorts of problems with ram 
fragmentation, and eventually you end up spending more time sorting 
out the problems caused by the system than it solves, but I thought I 
might as well use it in Final Fight, just so that Ronald McDonald at 
the Sales Curve would shut up! (Sorry Ronald!)

Oh yeah.. the real-time x/y-flipping and decompressing sprite-routine 
is alright too.. but a tad slow. Ah well, the Line of Fire real-time 
scaling sprite routine was slightly neat as well, and look how slow 
that game was!

The main problem with this game is the amount of time & memory used 
up by all the massive sprites.. I ripped all the graphics out of the 
arcade board's roms, and I really didn't want to have to shrink them 
or anything, so we end up with what you see here..  bloody huge 
sprites!

Tum te tum.. what next..? I know! It's..

                        The arcade machine's specs:

(The standard CapCom board- as used on everything from Ghouls'n'Ghosts
to Strider and Dynasty Wars)

68000 running at about 10Mhz
Z80 driving the sound chip (standard Yamaha 6-voice FM chip) and 
sample-playback hardware
1.5Mb of program and data roms (aargh!)
2Mb of sprite & character graphic roms (double aargh!) - there's space 
on the board for 16Mb!
256k of sample/music rom
Triple playfield screen, with a rather interesting method of 
displaying data (see later)
Loads of 128x128 hardware sprites with hardware X & Y flipping (bog 
standard)
64k of video ram
64k of processor ram

The screen displays are quite interesting.. the 3 overlayed 
playfields are made up differently.. but they are all character-
mapped, not bitmapped. Naturally they all have independant hardware 
scroll! There's also no practical limit on the number of characters 
you can access at any one time with a screen - all the character map 
screens use 16-bit character numbers!

Playfield 1:

  The back parallax layer consists of 32x32 character blocks, with 
  each block having a selectable pallette (of 16 colours) from a set 
  of 32 different pallettes.. (that's up to 512 colours on this 
  screen alone!) 

 Playfield 2:

  The main playing area.. Uses 16x16 character blocks, each with a 16 
  colour pallette selected from another bank of 32!

Playfield 3:

  The top layer for scores, text,etc. Uses 8x8 characters, 16 colours, 
  from yet another bank of 16 pallettes.

All characters can be individually X and Y flipped, and the playfield 
2 characters can be set to appear in front of or behind (or both) any
sprites!

Each sprite is up to 128x128 pixels, and is character mapped too!  
Only 16 colours in any one sprite, but the sprite pallette is 
selected from yet another set of 32 different ones! Naturally, the 
sprite can be flipped in either direction by just setting a bit!  I 
don't know how many sprites you get, but I suspect 64!

Right, so that gives you a grand total of 1280 colours on screen, not
counting the sprites, without even using raster-splits!  Don't you 
just want to BURN your Amiga?

Can you believe what you could do with this board? EVERYTHING is done 
in hardware, and you've got a 10Mhz 68000 just do change a few 
registers with! It doesn't even have to drive the sound chip..  the 
Z80 does that!

(This board is considered to be old technology and is not really used 
by Capcom much any more!!)

...Can I have one for Christmas, Santa?

If you think that's good.. you should have seen the hardware on Line 
Of Fire that I converted before! Two 12Mhz 68000s and a Z80 all co-
processing!

Oh yeah, if any other companies want to hire me to extract graphics 
and data from arcade boards they're converting, get in touch..

Ah well, back to the real world..

(Short bit about me, 'cos I wrote this game and I feel like it!) :-

I'm 21, tall, and with boundless enthusiasm (and far less talent) for 
music, playing pool and drinking alcohol... oh yeah.. I'm half 
Australian too (not that that helps!)

Written in my slum at our Bristol office, on a meagre:
A500 with 2.5mb, A590, Cygnus ED, Genim2 and DPaint3 (ArgAsm's bugged 
to hell!)
A500 with 1mb (to download to)
Poxy 1040ST in the corner covered in junk
 Comfy chair (noooooobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!)
Loud stereo & millions of albums
Video Walkman (+ all of BlackAdder II/III/IV & the Young Ones)
GameBoy (with Tetris superglued into it)
U.S. Robotics HST 9600 baud modem (for rapping with the artists in 
Whitby!)
Final Fight board (connected to crappy joystick and Commodore 
monitor!)
Some custom rom-reading hardware
Filter coffee machine, Microwave and endless copies of The 
Independent.

..That's it! No PDS, no SNASM, no nothing! C'est la vie!

For light relief at my flat, I've wasted huge amounts of money on;
Amiga A1000+2mb etc,etc
Casio FZ1 sampler
Roland D110 synth
Korg M1R synth
Cheetah MS6 analogue synth (and MkV II keyboard gathering dust)
Alesis Quadraverb digital effects processor (hours of fun!)
Alesis SR16 drum machine
Yamaha TX7 synth
Desktech 8-Channel mixer (now redundant)
Fender Strat (cheapo clone) guitar
CryBaby WahWah pedal (so I can sound like all the other crappy 
Manchester bands!)
A couple of el cheapo distortion/compression pedals
Fostex B16 16-track reel-to-reel tape recorder (wooo!)
SoundTracks 16:8:16 mixer (double woo!)
Yamaha FSK sync converter (crappy - not even SMPTE compatible!)
...and no, you can't come round and burgle me!

Actually, the CDTV has just come out, and does look rather sexy (I 
saw a preview at the Software Developer's Conf. in Bournemouth a while 
back, and it was well impressive) - maybe that's next on the 
'expensive toys' list..?

Right, that's that over with!

Ha ha! Neil Tennant's going GREY! I've just seen an interview in NME, 
and he is looking a tad oldish - never mind, amazing music 
nonetheless. I'm seeing the PSBs live at the NEC soon, and if this 
game is still under development then, I'll give you an update.

* (- 11th June - Yep! Saw them last monday in Birmingham!
  Were they good? - Is the Pope Catholic? The best live show I've 
  ever seen!)

Hey! I've just been mugged! (21st May) Some b**tard came up behind me
when I was coming home from a club last night and hit me over the head
bloody hard with something - I don't know what, I was do busy being 
knocked unconcious. I woke up in the gutter some time later, in a pool 
of blood (mine) with some nice police lady calling me an ambulance (I 
don't know why, my name is Richard, after all - ho ho ho). After about 
6 stiches in my head courtesy of the Bristol Royal Infirmary (and a 
tetanus jab), all I have to show for my night of fun is a small bald 
patch with blue stiches in on the back of my head, and the most 
amazingly coloured bruises you have ever seen. Who says you can't have 
fun in Bristol any more? Anyway, thanks to the nice police woman and 
the staff of the B.R.I. in casualty that night, and no bloody thanks 
at all to whoever hit me!

Oh yeah - Hi to all the plebs who crowd into the Virgin Games Centre 
in Bristol every Saturday morning and consistently refuse to 
recognise me or Tim, even when we talk loudly about all the games we 
have written!!!!
 
- hellos also to the regulars at the White Hart (+nice student barmaid)
and Sportsman pubs in Bristol!

Ah well, it looks like I'll be doing some Super Famicon, MegaDrive, 
or Master System work now, if our SNASM system ever turns up!!

By the way, hope you like the cheat mode! (very silly)

See you on the next one! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
        Luv and Irony,
                Richard Aplin.


P.S. All you young and impressionable people who think programmers 
make loads of money.. well, most of us don't! (Mind you, the hours 
are good!)

P.P.S. Good Startup-Sequence eh?

P.P.P.S. Update: My next game(s) are: 'GodFather III' (U.S. Gold)
                 and 'Creatures' (Thalamus) on 68000!
