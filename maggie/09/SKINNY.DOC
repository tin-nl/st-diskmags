[Capitol Records Biography sent by Nettwerk Productions]

The Skinny Puppy story began in the Summer of 1983 when Cevin
Key and Nivek Ogre discovered a similar taste for the bizarre and
mutated in music and film. The two joined forces and recorded the
"Back and Forth" cassette. The cassette - now a treasured rarity
among Skinny Puppy fans - garneded the attention of Vancouver's
Nettwerk Productions.

The "Remission" EP was released amidst the first wave of Nettwerk
releases in the fall of 1984. Produced by Cevin Key and  Dave
"Rave" Oglive, the band's debut EP propelled Skinny Puppy out of
the shadows and into enigmatic notoriety.

The crushing combination of percussive keyboard and rhythm work,
together with Ogre's own brand of malignant, cryptic vocalizations,
surprised and disturbed unsuspecting listeners throughout North
America. When the Play It Again Sam label of Brussels, Belgium,
licensed the record, the continent of europe was exposed to the
same treatment.

In October, 1985, with synthesist Wilhelm Schroeder in the ranks,
Skinny Puppy released their debut LP, "Bites", through Nettwerk
and Play It Again Sam. Production was once again handled by 
Cevin Key and Dave Oglive, with the exception of "Assimilate",
which was produced by Tom Ellard of Severed Heads. "Bites" quickly
received critical acclaim in North America and Europe, and charted
higher than any other Canadian independant release in recent memory
on charts like CMJ, Rockpool and U.S. Rock. Songs like "The Choke"
and "Assimilate" laid waste to dancefloors on both sides of the
Atlantic.

In the Summer of 1986, Wilhelm Schroeder left the band to pursue
solo work and was replaced by Dwayne Goettel, formerly of the band
Psyche.

On September 5, 1986, Skinny Puppy's second LP, "Mind: The Perpetual
Intercourse", was released. Boiling over with fresh sounds and
rhythms, "Mond: TPI" remains an expedition into a netherworld of
sonic, seething emotion. The first single, "Dig It", shot to the #10
position on the Rockpool/Rollign Stone dance chart and the LP reached
#17 on CMJ's chart. "Stairs and Flowers", remixed from "Mind: TPI"
by New York DJs Justin Straus and Murray Elias, expanded on the
mutant hip hop beat of "Dig It". Combined with the new track,
"Chainsaw", the single summer up Skinny Puppy's psycho-dance strategy
and it reached #8 on the Rockpool/Rolling Stone chart.

The release of the "Mind: TPI" LP also signalled the beginning of a
licensing agreement between Skinny Puppy and Capitol-EMI for the
world outside of Canada.

"Clease, Fold and Manipulate", Skinny Puppy's third full length LP,
 was released worldwide in October, 1987. The LP contained some of
their most coherent, powerful material to date. Tracks such as
"Anger", "Tear or Beat", and "Shadow Cast", with their heavy rhythms,
balanced perfectly with the more atmospheric feel of "The Mourn" and
"Epilogue". The 12" single of "Addiction" and "Deep Down Trauma
Hounds", remixed by British noise-supremo Adrian Sherwood, was
simply one of the most intense moments in Skinny Puppy's vinyl
history.

"Cleanse, Fold and Manipulate" marked a crossover of sorts for
Skinny Puppy. The public was finally coming around to Skinny Puppy's
nightmarish world on a larger scale. They could no longer be
dismissed as a cult phenomenon. And when People magazine reviewed
the LP, their popularity was undeniably confirmed.

Said David Hiltbrand (People): "Skinny Puppy craft what they call
audio sculpture. Of course, listeners might have other names for it.
Like insanity. Strange random sounds and echoes ricochet through the
mix. Dialogue drifts in and out, like sounds from a TV set in an
adjoining hotel room. The effect is like stepping into a nightmare
being experienced by the Phantom of the Opera."

Even the ever-fickle British press succumber to Skinny Puppy's aural
onslaught.

The Stud Brothers (Melody Maker): "Skinny Puppy are unspeakable.
They hurt and exhilarate. Skinny Puppy do what the best do - they
determine mood."

New Musical Express: "Liek the best horror books and films,
Skinny Puppy take one into one's darkest dreams and never let up
the pressure. The irony is the dream they are dealing with is the
reality we experience everyday we wake up. Extraordinary in every
way."

"VIVIsectVI", released in October 1988, was the long awaited follow
up. The LP and first single, "Censor" (alternately titled "Dogshit"),
were characterized by both brutal, relentless rhythms and strangely
accessible meelodic lines. "Testure", the next single, was the band's
most approachable song since "Dig It". To many people's surprise, it
cracked the Billboard Dance Chart top 20.

In support of the LP, Skinny Puppy undertook their most ambitious
tour to date. The trademark mind-bending live show had evolved to
more powerfully reflect the band's ongoing concerns for the animal
rights movement. Throughout the show, the audience witnessed a
transformation. Ogre began the show as an average man, complete with
his ignorance toward the plight of animals. As the show progressed,
Ogre became the laboratory vivisectionist, the enlightened man, and
finally the tortured test subject itself.

November, 1989 marks the release of "Rabies", Skinny Puppy's fifth
full length recording project. "Rabies" has been described by the
band as a thematic and musical continuation of 1985's "Bites" LP.
 From the first listen, it's obvious that "Rabies" is harder, heavier
and more fully realized than anything that has come before it. No
punches have been pulled and no effort has been spared in making this
the definitive Skinny Puppy LP.

Massive guitars, relentless, armour-plated beats and vocals from the
edge of madness all combine to create a collection of songs that are
typified by the electro biker-grundge of the first single, "Tin Omen".
And for the first time, Cevin Key and Dave Oglive have shared
production duties. Co-production on "Rabies" is handled by Chicago
noise-terrorist Al Jourgensen (Ministry, Revolting Cocks etc.). The
result is an increased sense of intensity and ergency that hasn't
been this upfront since "Bites".

Skinny Puppy have now become the premier practitioners of punishing,
ulta-aggressive, no-holds-barred electronic music. With the release of
"Rabies", this fact is now established beyond a doubt. Skinny Puppy
create the ultimate sonic, aural goosing.


SKINNY PUPPY - Remission and Bites 

 
SMOTHERED HOPE  

withered rope you hang what's empty can't remain to put it simply;
in time cry the hollow words to sing with false disguise;
smothered hope fly from sorrow for a new divine tomorrow;
i just don't want to know anymore;
life shifts up and down everybody knows it's wrong;
why don't you care? now do it seem fair?;
it's not in the rhyme or reason;
so it goes with every season crawl to top fall through bottom;
first hand love is really rotten;
slice of life find what's plenty inch towards a sanctuary;
light with me inside the womb;
i know everyone everybody knows it's me;
it's my voice, my voice cries out obscenity;
sightless eye regard my past sometimes it should;
i just don't want to know anymore.


 
GLASS HOUSES  

sit in darkness understand what i am is what i am;
overshadowed by assertion makes me certain;
solemn ponder wander shake shaded with a doubt nightmare full of fear;
solvent raining from the sky backlog danger hypnotize glass blown eyes;
stain in drain on procreate fascinate me instigate care to here;
morbid desert ice cream eyes so deceiving fraternize carefully;
create vision fabricate smash to pieces watch and wait
crash glass houses;
hasten grasp calculate foreign object phornicate smash glass houses;
 misinterpret reprimand are you here myself demands;
mediocre are you hearing headspace clearing.


 FAR TOO FRAIL  

lovers and legions i've seen your whore try not to reason forsaken
i'm poor;
fire nerves and dissension flying at a glare a ginger reaction
whisper care;
a hairpin decision falls against the brain;
to formulate the anguish and alleviate the pain;
the silence is warning soul search nothing can't regain reach for air;
scenes of a cheap thrill summon an old ghost;
the foremost and sterile suffering one lost to;
face the potential for fantasy and flair forever and forgiving;
summon me and dare;
they keep on the mainstream forging their demise while;
playing with the hopeless not facing their own lies;
the symptoms of recourse i've seen nothing;
overspill far too frail.


 SOLVENT  

silence the deadly golden cry out don't stay behind;
stay up internal breakdown bloodflow drip from the eyes;
incest the inner reason fast life lay in decline;
sank back in fresh arrival face split with life so why;
remorse a heartless soul senseless no apparent self control;
since then cold uncaring accusations run wild;
accelerate the heartbeat or so seen with their eyes;
twisting with truth or fact a kind of story that lies;
motion sickness is screaming stab cut retard my mind
tiresome a sacred leader sensations more than die;
fortune is worshiped highly one day to pray then die;
melting in fiery sand quick sink in false so high;
over erase replace cancel the way a trial.



 SLEEPING BEAST  

early one morning shattering life in the face;
the finest creative loss of grace;
out of heartshot with no hope meet the people try to cope;
nod the head with distraction faces flirt for your reaction;
with a grin over again start the day anothers whim;
nice to nightmare she's a sleeping beast;
lie the same dear anguish is your feast;
frighten the peaceful powerless thought in the head;
with decree attorney singe my dread;
in the darkness know it well siege of face love to tell;
how and why its indecision notice change by shapeshifting;
 from the real sacred seal rip with sex intelligent sneer;
resist the useless aggravation kicked in teeth;
the blankness created forms a wreath;
slap the coffin hear no shout feel the courage seeping out;
plunge the knife with no reason slash the name within season;
slump retreat run again ride the pain going insane;
very same morning shattering life in the face the finest creative
loss of grace;
find the truth far to down bring it up sense will drown;
inside review sense elation can't regain the motivation;
piercing probing is disturbing drove to me i'm not worth knowing.



 ASSIMILATE 
 
oil remove shred and tear radiation vapor;
it's the fear so unclear man in motion going nowhere;
in our homes stuck in the face spread the word to the populace;
yellow journal yellow journal set the pace feel the rage;
manifestations of a sort so insidious off the point;
simple solution never confusion sport a gun kill a cop;
crazy world of weary thought so receive me had enough;
lock me up lock me up;
rot and assimilate so hot to annihilate;
deviation tonic mess prolonged existence innocence;
is he who speaks isn't weak wheelchair virtue so to speak;
bubonic plague the truth of aids immunity avoid decay;
in the trench of pestilence the bible screams announce your faith;
mutterings of death to bring suffocate a newborn thing;
degradation of an age venereal it's all sensation;
protect design the moral plan infallible as propaganda;
completely black with no steps back;
hot to assimilate we'll rot or annihilate;
agony profusely stains the inner thinking of the brain;
accusations clanking chains experiments with the groans of pain;
all prefer no one blames the terror in an animal's screams;
in cages our future - the answers insane.



 THE CHOKE  

torment a stench one side inside no doubt lost count;
brutalize the half red eyes decide;
which side whose side you're in the middle of the fire;
a scythe and smock is sharp so sharp;
no conscience such confidence a crooked ear so insincere;
a glue on smile your social style tyrants rule is such a fool;
superior good advice it's so nice from you;
arguments so hideous they're heaven sent you can't repent;
words like ice cut and slice announce my demise;
christ why did you die;
superior good advice blood red and arguments;
 heaven sent torment my stench putrefy putrefy;
wise so wise you're not so wise;
shadow shadow shadow shadow why?.



 DEADLINE  

sample test at best is nothing less run for more i can't decide;
love in the grass is nothing less rather you look me in the eye;
your face creeping in your caring thankless grin;
immobilize the setting sin create the mood that's dark and grim;
aortic high arctic part mood altered my paradise is lost;
maskover no one left to dock hide the trap caution deadline remark;
aortic matches my grey skin known so long feels like the next of kin;
aortic high arctic part hide the trap caution deadline remains;
a jaded whip rosehip a shallow kiss chauvinistic go look inside;
whilst in the back a gold to lead to resurrect whats left to die;
fainted bait breathes faint tarnish and elevate wipe the slate
kiss goodbye;
overuse blank card rendezvous understand bells mourn the tired.


 LAST CALL  

trip the long dusty road care denounce no overload;
in as much as what's become a sterile crashed up iceberg tomb;
mist on ash on murky shore now begin don't let it show;
answers even without feeling no fulfilling close the door;
last call open bar never closing reach beyond;
last call a shallow pond slow descending so slow to drown;
watch the perfect dna switch pretend at last to see;
cancellation is the feel respectfully to never be;
symbolize simile put in words so simply;
ask direction no correction map the course to end the way;
catch the stall wishful air walk among do seem to care;
on the surface righteous air deliver on the right to share;
mesh the fine nuclear bond crawl between the chromosome;
on the top of what's become a two-fold generation boom.


 SOCIAL DECEPTION  

belladonna yet you cry passing incandescent creatures dark
recesses living;
is hot retort got to take effect the outring teaching nothing
new the truth;
conform the fate of the forest everything that's hot it's melancholy;
morality it's him the beast forest creeps steep rocks the paws
bleed waving;
her caught rabies whir seeking clench best prolong the dread the
fiends set;
upon him to tear him to pieces him heart are you so feeling
incredibly;
 rapidly take it contemplate aim find my grace blood.


That's all,  we really just can suggest that you buy some  Skinny 
stuff  and listen yourself.  If you're into EBM (Electronic  Body 
Music,  mushroombrain) mixed with heavy, Skinny Puppy's the right 
band for you!
