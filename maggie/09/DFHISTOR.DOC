Since  there  were quite some major changes  with  our  memberstatus 
lately,  we decided to clear some things now.  And just to bore  you 
more  (and fill this crappy diskmag) we will tell you  the  complete 
history of our bizarre group.

Late in 1986 the disaster began. Chaos Inc. and New Mode went to the 
same  school somewhere in the very south of West- Germany  (we  still 
insist on this extension!).  Some day Chaos asked New Mode for  some 
hacked  games.  Later on the both guys talked more about coding  and 
hacking in general (errmmm....  far more about hacking).  So it came 
to this damned day...  They decided to form a group just to do  game 
hacks.  Some more people joined immediately:  Questlord, Green Beret 
(one  of New Mode's friends from the good  old  C64,  yeah),  German 
Cracking Force (G.C.F.).  Later on Joe Cool and Chaos Inc.'s  friend 
called  Atari Boy Crackings (A.B.C.) joined their  ranks,  too.  The 
only thing Delta Force did was hacking, cracking and guess what, yes 
swapping.
So  we had a whole lot of contacts then.  One of them was Phil  from 
England. He supplied us with lotsa originals and spread our stuff in 
the UK. Some weeks later he joined us, too.
Hacking was good,  but we loved those nice intros always to be  seen 
infront of hacked C64 games.  All the early hacks just had a  simple 
text  output (like  Superior  intros nowadays,  hehehe) so we  had  to 
change  that.  We  lacked  a good painter so two  of  that  kind  of 
computer  people entered our group.  It was a guy called Psycho  who 
brought his friend Gogo with him.  Psycho painted some nice graphics 
and  Chaos did his first intro ever.  It was quite awesome.  Do  you 
remember our "Test Drive" hack?  It was the best intro for that time 
without bragging around here.
Nobody thought of doing demos at this stage of our history.  We just 
had hacking in our obscure brains (like some still have,  won't tell 
any names here...).
In the beginning of 1988 one of the strangest persons intruded  into 
our lovely and peaceful group. Dolph Slimenegger alias Slime was his 
name.  We still celebrate this black day,  honest.  He was a painter 
and he went to the same class as G.C.F. and New Mode.
Good. So we still hacked and did trainers (that was A.B.C.'s job, by 
the way).  Chaos Inc.  wrote his first game called "Dugger"  (wasn't 
that big success because the software house ripped him off).
And like many German hackers,  some of us got busted by the  police. 
Unfortunately  we got a warning and so the police didn't  find  what 
they  were  searching for.  We stopped for some  weeks  and  started 
again.  But it was senseless, the whole hacking market was dominated 
by  a cooperation called  The Bladerunners .  They did all  the  hacks 
and  they  were really fucking fast so that slow  and  lazy  hackers 
like us didn't stand a chance at all.
In April or May 1988 we met  The Exceptions   (TEX)  and we all  decided 
 to   form   a  new  association  to  break  the  monopoly   of    The 
Bladerunners .  This new and mighty cooperation was called The Union.  
Our  basic  interests  just were good quality  hacks  and  excellent 
intros.  Apart from  TEX  and us some other groups entered  The  Union , 
too.  They  were  Level 16 ,   Softrunner Group  and our good old  mates 
 TNT-Crew.   But  let's  stop this,  this text is supposed to  be  the 
history of Delta Force and not of  The Union .
We continued with hacking again (interesting,  huh?) but now we  had 
far more support with originals,  intros and stuff.  If you think we 
did  just  hacks for  The Union ,  you are quite wrong. New Mode did the 
second      Union-intro,       maybe      you      remember      the 
BubblesAndSwinginglogoTrackingSprites intro?
In September 1988,  The Union  came to the decision to do a demo. Some 
groups like  The   Carebears   (TCB) , The Replicants  and  XXX-International 
had  entered  some  weeks  before  and  we  were  a  whole  lot   of 
programmers,  painters  and  one  musician.  "The  Union  Demo"  was 
released  at the beginning of 1989 with a rather mediocre screen  by 
us.  Compared to the three days in which it was done,  it's not  too 
bad.
Now we have 1989.  Some guys of  The Union  had just formed a software 
house  and  so we thought it wouldn't be that good idea to  keep  on 
hacking games. At least not hack games under the Union-label.
Slime,  Questlord  and New Mode founded a new group  called   Delight  
together  with some guys from  TEX.   We now called  ourselves  Viper, 
Xanth  and  Steve.  We did some intros and again hacks but  at  this 
time all the hacking was getting more and more boring.  Delta  Force 
was dead at this time (or let's say undead).
We've lost interest in all the hacking for  Delight  since it was  far 
too much work and we were all (and some still are) lazy gits.  So we 
left   Delight   again and thought about other things to do  with  our 
computers.  So we came up with one of the worst ideas ever: coding a 
demo.  In the beginning of 1989 we rebuilt Delta Force and  released 
some hacks now and then but hacking wasn't something to keep us busy 
anymore.  Finally in May 1989 we stopped all hacking-activities  and 
so  we had to clean up our group.  Joe Cool was kicked out since  he 
wasn't good for anything,  Psycho left on his own,  Gogo joined   The 
Carebears   after  some personal problems with New  Mode,  Phil  left 
because he sold his ST,  and finally G.C.F.  quit the group since he 
was just gambling with our hacks all the time.
Two  or  three screens for our demo were finished at this  time  but 
Slime and New Mode had to join another group in June 1989: The WEST-
 German army. So not much time was left for doing screens. They  just
were doing some screens when they were on holidays.
Meanwhile  Chaos  Inc.  was starting with  another  mighty  project: 
improving our alltime favourite painting program :  "NEOchrome".  He 
just did this because he needed some functions (e.g. cutting shapes) 
to speed up his own work on his game called "Rings of Medusa".  As a 
byproduct  of his work the foerken best painting program for the  ST 
was developed called "NEOchrome MaSTer". Heard of it before? If not, 
just go ahead and p... off.
In  the  middle  of  1990  we  arranged  the  "International  Coding 
Conference  #1" (I.C.C.  #1) in a small cottage in an  even  smaller 
village. Just 30 people were invited, far more wanted to come but we 
didn't  care (and we didn't have the place for them to be  precise). 
 The  party was really funny and everybody seemed to have enjoyed  it 
quite much. NEOchrome Master (v2.0) was released at this party.
Our "Syntax Terror" demo was intented to be released there too,  but 
due  to a serious lack of screens it wasn't possible at all (we  had 
far more release dates in mind,  but we won't tell them.  They  were 
ridiculous...).
Some weeks after the I.C.C. #1,  another invitation  reached us. The 
party was called STNICCC and was organized by some Undutchables (aka 
Richard  and  Stefan  of our rival diskmag,   ST-News   (heard  of  it 
before?)).  Finally we thought releasing the goddamned demo at  this 
party would be a good idea.  Some guestscreens arrived and New  Mode 
completed this two-years-overdue demo in the last months of 1990.
Concluding,  1990 was the best year for Delta Force,  till  now.  We 
released  "NEOchrome  Master"  and  "Syntax  Terror",  arranged  the 
I.C.C.  #1 and won the 3.5KByte competition at the STNICCC  (modesty 
has never been our strong side).
We've got heaps of letters after "Syntax Terror" and answering  some 
of them took us more time than we first thought.  So all you  people 
who  never  got a reply of us,  just remember that  we  always  said 
we'll   just  answer  letters  with  international   reply   coupons 
(something to change for our German stamps).  So don't be too angry, 
we just can't afford answering everybody.
One of the letters was by Flix of  Offbeat .  We wrote regularly since 
he seemed to be an interesting person.  Some months later Slime  and 
New Mode visited  Offbeat  in Bavaria (one of the most annoying  parts 
of WEST- Germany).  At this visit  Offbeat  was flushed down the toilet 
and Flix,  Ray and Big Alec entered Delta Force. Two good coders and 
a very good musician, that's what we wanted.
Some weeks before this,  Green Beret and A.B.C. left the group since 
they  were  on  undead status for a long time  and  both  had  other 
interests now (e.g. their PC, bleurgh).
Soemthing  nice happened at the end of May:  a female being came  to 
our group: Mascot. Just one thing to say about her: not much is true 
what  you've read about her in the last issue (especially the  parts 
about her and Sammy Joe, hehehe).
The I.C.C.  #2 was arranged then,  many people were  invited,  Chaos 
Inc.  messed  up  the whole organization,  but the party  was  still 
held.  It wasn't half as good as the I.C.C.  #1, that's our opinion. 
At the party,  Thor of  Black Monolith Team  left his group and  added 
himself to us. He was a painter and we had a severe lack of them.
Another  thing about the party was that we got to know some  of  the 
most bizarre Englishmen we've ever met:   Ripped Off . Nothing more to 
tell  about them apart from that they are our REAL  friends  and  not 
some  of those  we-don't-fuck-us-in-our-scrollers-and-so-we're-good-
friends mates, no "friendship rules" bastards, just FRIENDS .
Sammy  Joe  moved to WEST- Germany some months later  and  the  first 
thing  he  did was rampaging with our group.  That means  that  this 
shite  mag became a Delta Force production.  The new  outfit  you're 
looking  at right now is a byproduct of his step (leaving   The  Lost 
Boys  and joining Dental Floss).
One  thing  was  missing in Delta Force.  We  just  had  WEST- German 
members (no,  not EAST- Germans were missing!).  As  Phalanx  was down, 
the  first Swedes filled up our memberlist.  The One and  Earthlight 
entered  in October.  The One is now known as Daniel,  his  original 
 name.
We've  released our first demo after all this soaking up of  people. 
It  was called "Punish Your Machine" and is the official party  demo 
of the I.C.C. #2. Nothing more to say about it, just see yourself.
Just  one  thing  happened in late 1991 after the  release  of  PYM. 
Another German changed from  Lost Boys  to us...  It was  Oxygene.  We 
never  intended  to piss off the  Lost Boys  by sucking  off  all  the 
members if you thought so.  Some things just happen and some  people 
have reasons for some steps (some some some).
Before we forget...  In December the most ugly demo ever was done by 
New Mode...  "angST".  It's really utter bullshit, it hasn't got any 
intention  or  message  in it even if some  people  thought  so  (hi 
Patrick).
And again in December,  Delta Force got a new coder. He's one of the 
two  Nutty Norwegians and he's calling himself Wizzcat.  He did  the 
fab "Protracker" and other nice things.
Another  thing that happened in 1991 was the release of  "Return  of 
Medusa", the sequel to Chaos' second game.
Now it's 1992...  The year is still young...  But we just got a  new 
member  (who  expected  this?).  He's the second guy  of  the  Nutty 
Norwegians, his name is Lord Hackbear and he's a coder, too.
The story is finished now,  we all decided that 15  (!!!) members  is 
far  enough  although we already had some more  membership  requests 
lately.
By  the time you read this article a new music demo should  be  out. 
It's  name  is  "Torture  Your Ears" and it's  done  by  Daniel  and 
Earthlight, the music is by  Hemroids .
Talking about future projects,  a new demo is on it's way.  The name 
of this demo will be "Problem Child". It will be a new kind of demo, 
very  stylish  and  stuff like that.  Wait  for  it,  you  won't  be 
disappointed. Oxygene and Big Alec are also working on a music demo, 
but it's still top secret what it will be like. Release dates? Hmmm. 
Who knows? Not us.

So  that's  really enough for this history.  We could  have  written 
more,  but  nobody  would like to read all  details.  Apologize  our 
rather  bad English,  but would you prefer reading a German  article 
instead?

You have seen that it was possible for some maniac hackers to change 
into a LEGAL  demo group, so why don't you try that, too?

What left is the complete memberlist of one of the oldest groups  on 
the Atari ST (if not the oldest active group)...

Here  it is...  Everybody who pretends to be a member of us and  can 
not be found in this list is a liar. Go and kick his ass, you've got 
permission.

IMPORTANT UPDATE:  Karl of Chaos has joined our group recently. We're 
16 now.
