Name:  Ben
Group:  Chaos (  Chaotic Mayhem Ltd.(very Ltd.))
Country:  England
Function   in   group:    Coder,Graphics   individual,Motivator,PR 
man,Make-up assistant,Main drinker and all round great guy.

Describe the activities of your group:   we have recently released 
our  second demo,  entitled PANDEMONIUM,  the first being  DOUBLE 
DOOZER,  which recieved many accolades including worst demo ever, 
most badly written demo ever,  and of course came second in the
well  known  competition  for  the  demo  called  double   doozer 
competition.(joint second) 
What was your last production?  erm.
Can I have your babies ben ?  Yes you MAY.
Tell  us  more  about yourself:   well,  what  is  there  to  say, 
really,I'm great in (and out of) bed,  I'm fun to be around,  and 
I'm loaded.
Tell us more about your group:  we have 5 members....
  me(ben),  tat(coder  - he's our  funny  man),ntt  (grafix),karl 
(another  coder  - well at least he says he's a  coder,  I  never 
actually see anything he does, he usually sends the wrong disk..)
and finally tufty who occasionally writes a tune for me.
Is this one of the standard questions, or is it one that has just 
been inserted by you,  Ben,  you total bastard ?   Yes, its a fair 
cop, I have just inserted it.
Any future plans/ideas for your group?  no megademos for a bit- if 
ever as  they  take up too much time,  and with me being a can't  be 
arsed  kinda guy,  I should think we'll never do one,  but  we'll 
still  be  very active writing guest screens for  people,  so  if 
anyone wants one... then...
What things do you like on the ST scene?  big things and sometimes 
little things, but mostly big things..
What  things do you not like on the ST scene?   middle  things,  I 
hate  middle things,  and some small things,  but  middle  things 
 really piss me off.
Why did you buy an ST?   because I wanted a computer.I already had 
a BBC and no-one had amigas at the time,  everyone had st's, so I 
bought one, because it had good gfx. and was fast (in 1987).
Was that last question boring or what ?  It was boring.
Describe  any  other  non-computer  interests:    shagging  is  my 
favourite,(except  with  ugly  men).  I  also  pursue  an  active 
interest in shooting (ie not shagging)....thats guns.
What  was  the last game you bought and why?   3d  grand  prix  by 
microprose because its excellent and was well worth the money,  I 
am also interested in 3d and it's 3d is shit hot.
If  you  do not buy any games - why not?   I only do if  they  are 
good,  and  they have to be very very good,  because I'm a  tight 
arsed bastard, and any money I get I keep.
Describe any commercial products from you or your group:   the one 
which  immediately  springs  to mind out of  our  wide  range  of  
commercial  products  is  the "bugger-all  suite"  and  also  the 
"blank-disk  type proggy" they are both brill and can  be  bought 
from  me  at  my address for only œ50.34 - a snip  at  twice  the 
price.
Who are your 3 favourite demo coding groups and why?  I'm going to 
have to be boring and say:
     Number 1:  TCB  - because cuddly is simply the best-  but  
even  so, being  complacent is not really on - this does not
 just apply  to this group, many are equally if not more guilty.  
      Number 2:   TLB - I am a great friend of manikin,  and  know 
from first hand how good he is at coding,  and like TCB has  been 
coding for a long time consistenly, improving.
     Number 3:   OVR - Mainly because of ziggy, he is from what I 
have  seen an excellent programmer ,  and I have a great deal  of 
respect  for  his  talent.(ooer!)  -  Mega  tridi  was  great   ! 
Do you know your a total arselick ?  Yes I do.

What are your 3 favourite games and why?  oooo...
My 3 favorite ever are:
                Cholo (BBC)
                3D grand prix (ST)
                 Llamatron (ST) 
What are your 3 favourite utilities/programs and why?   GenST  for 
fucking  obvious reasons,  which I'm just not going  to  mention, 
because  if  you can't guess then your rubbish.  Also  FCOPY  PRO 
because its bloody ace. And... STOS ! Yes, thats right I code all 
my demos in STOS ...  cor,  TEXTURE MAPPING in STOS, wow ! No not 
really,  but  all  my  tables I do  in  stos..  Its  really  user 
friendly.
If you had written a game and saw a hacked copy, how would you 
feel?   I'd  feel  cheated,  raped by a stranger with  big  teeth, 
touched  in  places I'd never been  touched  in  before,strangely 
aroused,  and  later  I'd  feel a sense of deep  guilt  and  self 
hatred.... or is that an answer to a different question..? 
What  do  you think about slandering other groups?   I  think  its 
great....ie.  TLB  are  shit,  CHAOS are  wankers,  EVERYONE  are 
cunts..  no jovialities aside,  I think its senseless, and unless 
its  done  in   good humour (see above  -  in  good  humour,  not 
humourous) I think that the crews who are doing it are children. 
Describe any ST parties you have attended?   fuck all,  so I cant, 
....soz.
What are your views on the fact that the ST is losing 
popularity?
  I view it too, and cry tears of blood.
How long have you been working on your new demo?  About a year and 
2  months-  thats how long it took to make,  but I've had  a  few 
girlfriend breaks in between.
Can  you tell us more about your demo?   yes,  heres the  complete 
listing..
         MOVE.L #$80000,-(a7)
         MOVE.W #$20,-(a7)
         TRAP   #1
         ADDQ.L #6,a7
.loop    NOT.W  $FFFF8240.w
         BRA.S  .loop
isn't this a good demo,  its called the flashing screen demo..
When is it due for release?  anytime now....
Who or what inspired you to write demos?  Playing with my dick too 
 much I'd put it down to.
Tell  us  your favourite demo of 1991 and  why?   Ooh  Crikey  and 
European  Demos have joint top position,  because they  are  good 
and  not  bad,  its a stupid question,  so it deserves  a  stupid 
reply.

Do you have any ideas for improving Maggie?   Yes,  charge for  it 
and send me the profits..
Do  you know your really ace Ben,and all the best lases  go  after 
you,  and everyone idolises you and thinks your dead funny and  a 
really great coder etc. etc. etc. ?   No.
