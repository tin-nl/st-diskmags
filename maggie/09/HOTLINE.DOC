
 Inside my lorry I am driving through the night
Inside my lorry the world does look all right

 Five to five I got to drive and if you ask me where I go
I tell you coast to coast is what I do, coast to coast, you know

 Motors noise
My only choice
I wanna hear it all night long
Orchestra for my voice
For my only song

Coast to coast, that's my life, coast to coast, all right
Motors noise, my only choice, I wanna hear it all night long
Orchestra for my voice, for my only song

Yes  we know,  this demo is quite old,  but since it has never  been 
reviewed in  Maggie  so far, it's now time to do so.
The main purpose of this demo is to slag off Mad Max,  so let's  see 
if  the guys in  Eternal  (former  Hotline ) succeeded...  Some guys  of 
 Eternal   are also known as professional game  musicians,  this  "sub 
group" is called  Synth Dream.  And they are very good, indeed.

So what can we do now? Use the main menu and review one screen after 
the other?  No.  There is no menu,  so we have to load through  each 
single screen. This is a bit annoying, but who cares?

ˆLoading Screen:

 Some  "loading"- and "depacking" graphics and a very  nice  digidrum 
music. Looks ok.


ˆThe Union-Intro-Lookalike-Intro:
 
The  name says it all.  The music is almost the same,  graphics  are 
rather good,  the syncscroller is shite since it doesn't work on New 
Mode's ST. All in all, not bad.


ˆ3D-Wired-Gfx:
ˆ
 Mediocre starfield,  one plane bender, good music, some 3D wired gfx 
and  a   Synth Dream  logo in the lower border.  Average and  more  or 
less boring.
Œ

ˆMad Max isn't Arnie:

 Some nice animation with Mr. Hippel, see yourself. Quite cool.


ˆMusic selector:

 Here's not a real demo screen, "just" 16 tunes to select with a nice 
picture.  The  musics are all ace,  some of them are  from  "Monster 
Business" if you know this game.


ˆMad-ŒCripple-Nippleˆ-Max-Mix:

 This screen is very funny indeed.  After Mad Max made a fool out  of 
Michael Bittner with is music in "Life's a Bitch",  now it's him who 
is  fooled.  The  "Bittner-Mix" was just music,  this  mix  is  with 
animations. And they are really great. A digitized photo of Mad Max, 
some tracker music, and all the different effects fit to this music. 
This screen is brilliant.  We laughed ourselves to pieces (and we're 
not very easy to impress). Hope Mad Max won't loose his humour.


ˆThe Finale:

 Again  a (rotating) starfield with a fine logo,  fab music and  some 
zooming text displayed. Press "h" for some jokes about scene people, 
mainly Mad Max is insulted here. Ok.


ˆReset-Screen (and last screen in general):

 Well drawn zooming  Eternal  logo,  music, that's all. But it fits, if 
you know what we mean.


                           ˆConcluding:
 
This  demo might be insulting to some people (especially  Mad  Max), 
but  we  still think this demo is ok.  As a matter of  fact  he  has 
fooled  some people too (Bittner and Fabian),  now he'll  know  what 
 they  feel. So keep your humour, Mad Max.

Name             : Eternal Sound Demo
Group            : Eternal/Hotline/Synth Dream (?)

By  the  way,  this demo needs one meg to run,  so all  you  halfmeg 
lamers, flush yourself down the toilet or buy an extension.
