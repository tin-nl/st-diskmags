  Tea for several hundred, as arranged by Delta Force  and friends 


Every  demo  crew has it's day,  and Delta Force has opted  for  a 
rather cold and foggy day in late January,  for me to review their 
latest Masterpiece,  or possibly,  a criminal waste of disk space, 
this review will decide..

Switch on machine, disk go whirr, whirr, grind, and the very first 
screen comes up.. This consists of large poster-type lettering , a 
large  brash logo which fades in and out,  the purpose to get some 
introductory credits to the readers attention, music is soundchip, 
by the Delta Force resident musician, Big Alec..

The  loader  screen  for the main menu (and  every  other  screen) 
consists  of  a screenful of something that looks  like  an  anti-
aliased  pool  of vomit (Quite a decent effect,  in spite  of  the 
description  given!!)  with more lettering in a  large  bold  font 
which introduceds each screen appearing in a teletype fashion..

Main  Menu..   This  is very similar to the SOWATT copy party  main 
menu,  a huge vertically scrolling virtual screen, sixteen screens 
deep!   as   each  different  screen  has  its  own  full   screen 
representation or title,  a full screens worth.. Also going on, is 
a scrolltext in the background,  and several of the plasma rasters 
that  are  rapidly  becoming  a Delta  Force  trademark..  A  very 
attractive  main  menu, with not even the least hint of purple..

Also  available from 'help' is an alternative menu,  much simpler, 
which gives the key-presses ("1" to "F6").

1.  Delta Force,  Sickest so Far..   This is a Big Alec special,  a 
screen entirely produced by the group musician (If Count Zero  can 
do  it..) A star field/fountain,  a top 'Delta Force' logo  barrel 
 scrolling,  two very small scrollers, another scroller, that drops 
from  the top of the screen,  and another wavey horizontal scroll. 
The music is soundchip and has a hint of that old classic, Tubular 
Bells!! 

2.  BMT,  Coast..   One  of  my favourite screens on the whole demo, 
described  as  a  Cray  Emulator,   these  are  superfast  fractal 
generation  routines,   and  this  demo  is  a  genuine  recursive 
Mandlebrot  and  Julia  set generator,  this goes from  the  over-
familiar basic Mandlebrot, into many different patterns and forms, 
there  is  also a successful combination of  decent  colours,  and 
soundchip  music..  Surely  BMT have come a long way,  since their  
days  on  the early Alliance demos.  They have further  plans  for 
these fractals, and it will be interesting to see these..

3.  Delta Force,  Copper Kaah Baah Naah..  ( Aka Colourshock XXII..) 
 Another  'combination  of  parts to make a  whole'  screen.  Lower 
border  and  rasters text scroller,  shimmery 'DF' logo,  and  yet 
another stomach-churning plasma screen and some more text too...

4.  Ishido,  Way  of  the  Stones..   The in-demo game,  an ancient 
strategy,  stone matching game, usual sort of small P.D. type game 
which grows on people, given the Delta Force treatment so it looks 
a lot better than it once did as a PC shareware game..

5.  Delta  Force,  When  Colours are going Bang..   Those people who 
do  these screens like to deceive us,  and build up slowly to  the 
finish, don't they?? Starts off perfectly quietly with a starfield 
and a boringly average border scroll,  then goes to a disgustingly 
coarse  large  scroller,  then adds rasters.  Then it narrows to a 
centre  portion  of  the screen.  And finally changes  the  raster 
patterns to something like a coloured tile effect,  then starts to 
map   itself  on  various  invisible  surfaces!!   giving  a   3-D 
perspective  effect  as it is doing it..  (If you  must   do a  text 
scroller, make it interesting to look at, Delta Force have..)

6.  Electra,  Leif Rullar..   An intriguing departure from 'normal' 
 (What  is "Normal" around here??) Starts off like the intro  to  a 
'Shadow  of the Beast' or similar type game,  with a static  title 
screen,  some  strange,  "Chained Trolls groaning in unison to the 
slave-masters  whip.."  sort  of  music  (Is  this  an  Ad  for  a 
forthcoming  game??)  and  then into the  demo  proper..  This  is 
divided up into several mini-screens, a demo within a demo..

a).  A globe with 1400 dots on its surface struts its stuff,  along 
with several other polygona and weird shapes..

b).   2-D  spline,  or  sinous dots,  trailing around the screen in 
different patterns..

c).  A Vector balls screen..

d).  A 964 point ball (better than the Amiga group Phenomena..)

e).  A dense starfield and some greets..

In  spite of their own modesty,  I think this is a good effort  by 
Electra..

7.  Overlanders, There are Many Sheeps in Outer China..  The newest 
members  of  The Union,  celebrate with another  multi-part  demo, 
firstly  a logo for the 1992 Winter Olympics boots up,  then  into 
the demo proper..

a).   Narrow  centre  band,  with  starfield and vector text,  with 
rasters..

b).   Starfield, a vector 3-D 'OVR' logo which beats in time to the 
music, which changes into other 3-D shapes.. Also, a changing logo 
in the bottom border..

c).  A scroller and module, the scroller is greets and credits..

 The  Overlanders  have recently incorporated the  Pendragons,  and 
 with approximately 7% of the entire French population now members, 
the Overlanders are soon set to be the largest ST demo crew in the 
world!!!

8. ST-Connexion, Lets do the Twist Again..  According to the blurb, 
this  has  a 16khz tracker tune and loads of other stuff,  but  it 
does not work on an STE..

9. Legacy, The Cube..  The Amiga group Phenomena has been mentioned 
before, here is another successful rendition of a famous screen by 
them.  The  Cube   is  a  3-D vector  cube  with  different  things 
happening  on  each  face!!  the cube turns and  moves  about  the 
screen,  interespersed  with  other stuff such as a  moire  effect 
chrome pattern, who says that the ST can't hack it!!

10.  Delta  Force,  The  Best part of the Creation..   The official 
greets  screen  for  the ICC#2 Convention,  some very  small  text 
scrolls  on to the screen,  with credits,  and greetings for those 
people  who  attended the event of the year,  also,  a  shimmering 
pattern snakes onto the screen..

11.  Naos,  Punish  Your  Machine..    (From  Space to Leutenbach..)  
Starts  off very promisingly with a superbly painted 'NAOS'  logo, 
then a scene reminiscent of some of the Bitmap Bros best work  and 
is again,  like the start up to a game..  The demo proper consists 
of a ballfield and scroller,  and is a bit of a letdown after what 
came before..

12.  Future  Minds,  ICC-2  Screen..   Some very good still graphix 
appear whilst the main demo is calculating,  some graphix from the 
Red-Sector  demo,  the  the  main  demo starts,  consisting  of  a 
screenfull  of vertically scrolling bars,  then scrolltexts appear 
at  either  side  of the screen,  then the centre portion  of  the 
screen  is  stripped away to reveal a hugely  magnified  character 
moving about, a looped sample plays..

13.  Mystic,  Magic Rasters..  Very much an ULM-type screen, with a 
 full screen display,  starting with two raster bars, then going to 
a fullscreen distorting thingy, a scrolltext moves vertically, and 
later  on,  parts of the screen are magnified.  A module player is 
also in use, another very good screen..

14.  Scum  of  the  Earth,  Twenty-Four  Minute screen..   (And  it 
shows..) Double scrolltest,  then bouncing sprite, and 'Alien'.. A 
decidedly average screen,  and rather rushed.. We are advised this 
was a last minute replacement for a better screen..

15.  Starbyte,  Return  of  Medusa..   An advertisment on behalf of 
Starbyte  software for a new game,  'Return of Medusa' which seems 
to  incorporate  elements  of 'Dungeonmaster',  according  to  the 
still-screen graphix.. Music by none other than Mad Max..

16.  Reset Demo..   A combined TLB/Delta force effort, a huge (8200 
point) starfield,  and Quartet tune, 'TLB' and 'Delta Force' logos 
formed  out of the stars zoom at you and dissolve back into  their 
component parts as they enter the front of the screen!!  Excellent 
screen.. (Some greets for a couple of minutes whilst the main demo 
pre-calculates..)

 (Some small bits.)  The demo is a two-disk job, and rather sensibly 
keeps the demos for the top half of the menu on disk one,  and the 
bottom half menu screens on disk two,  cuts down on disk swapping. 
The disk change screen is a disk  (Hem, hem..)  enveloped by several 
slow-motion glorious technicolour explosions.. 

Ratinggggzzzz:-

Graphix:-   93%    -  Too  much good work  here  to  really  go  into 
specifics, but Reset , and Fractal  screens particularly good..

Sonix:-   90%  -  Lots of  original  soundchip  music,  a  refreshing 
change from Mad Max, and some digi-sounds.. Plenty of high-quality 
material here too..

Gee  Whizz:-  94% - This was a consistently high quality work   with 
only  one or two patchy screens,  the theme seems to have been  to 
imitate  the  current  Amiga whizz-kids Phenomena,  and  did  they 
succeed   (Well,  yes  of course they did!!)  The  rather  wonderful 
Reset demo and super-fast Fractals are mentioned here again, along 
with the Cube  screen..

Overall:-   93% - The best Copy-Party/Convention demo to  date,  on 
the ST..
