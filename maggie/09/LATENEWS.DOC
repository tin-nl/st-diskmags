 
  Ahem..... 
 
  It's time to dig out the old Upsider  hat and raincoat, for some
  VERY, VERY, LATE NEWS....
 
  Reliable sources have it that a certain anti-piracy organisation 
 Who  go  very  Quickly..   have  taken  time  off  from  fearlessly 
unravelling  a  large  cracker  network,  to  visit  (or  is  that 
 vivisect??   )  the  premises  of a certain PDL who  are  based  in 
Dorset,  or  thereabouts..  The result of this was the large-scale 
removal  of  the entire stock of  Sample Demos!!   On the  basis  of 
copyright  infringement of the sampled  Artistes ,  credit not being 
given, permission not sought, etc..

Upsider  wonders what they will make of such illuminating disks  as 
the Micromix Demo , consisting of M.A.R.R.S  "Pump up the Volume???"  
Just  who  has had their copyright infringed there?!?!?!
 
Upsider   also  considers that as the vast majority of  sample,  as 
opposed to Module,  demos were produced very early on, in the ST's 
history,  it would seem to be 'Bolting the Stable door...etc, etc' 
Three years too late....  

 It is not known whether any sample demos of The Plastic Ono  Band, 
 or The Birdie Song  have been found and destroyed yet...

Without  wishing  to cast any doubt on the role of  this   Swiftly-
Moving   Anti-piracy organisation,  it would seem that someone  has 
inhaled  rather  too  deeply of the ink on the  PDL  catalogue,  a 
headstrong  search for the criminal element in  normally  harmless 
sample demos followed, with tears for everyone..

 But  seriously..   Do you think that there is any inconvenience  or 
major loss of revenue involved in the production of sample  demos, 
a Largely outmoded  Art-form, To the original  Artistes  ??
