                          BY ALAN JOHNSTONE
                          
        No this isn't the Sun, but this is a new column that I have 
decided to write, entirely devoted to new developments and anything 
else that I feel should be covered. This article is, at the moment, 
being typed on GenST. Why is it that you can never find a word 
processor when you need one? Answers on a postcard to the normal 
address.
        I have written a few letters to software and hardware
manufacturers and hopefully I will be receiving demonstration
products to review in the next Maggie. I love freebies, don't you?
        The latest Atari product to be released is the ST Book. The
ST Book is a portable laptop with LCD screen and is due to be 
released at the 16 Bit Computer Show at Wembley in February. The new
machine's features include 4MB of internal RAM and a 40MB internal
Hard Drive. It will not come cheap at œ1,500, but doubtless some
lucky sods will be able to afford the luxury of owning one of these
great machines. Look out for more news when it is actually released.
        If you're having trouble finding disks, then it is because
there is a shortage after the Christmas rush. Those stupid idiots at
Sony and TDk have kept imports low for some obscure reason. There
will, of course be the odd price increase herea nd there, so wait
a while before buying a hundred disks to boost your collection of
software.
        Do little Brothers and Sisters play around with your treasured
ST and really piss you off? Ladbroke Computing have the answer. 
ST Secure consists of a 1 inch square board which can be fitted into 
the ST and requires no soldering. It resets the ST 45 seconds after
booting up (from a key disk) if the correct password isn't entered.
It costs a very reasonable œ25, but it's alot cheaper to kick the 
shit out of the little sods!

        Rumour has it that some of the big cracking names have been 
busted by F.A.S.T. I'm not too sure who has been done over, but it is 
rumoured to have happened in the Merseyside area. Phones have been 
tapped, mail intercepted and doors kicked in. Look out for more info 
when I can manage to get some.

        In the next issue of Maggie I hope to devote this section to 
that ever controversial subject of software piracy. I would like to 
hear from all of the major piracy crews (unless you're in prison!) 
and also people like F.A.S.T. Confidentiality will of course be
maintained. Each side will have their chance to say their piece. If
you would like to contribute to this article, then write to me at :

That's it for this particular article. I hope this article will come out
alright, because I have never used GenST as a word processor before.
Don't worry folx, the next article will be alot better than all this 
drivel! Until the next time . . . . . See Ya!
