  'You have been selected to go to a show which is  overwhelmingly 
P.C. orientated, the only way you will have a good time is to have 
several hundred pounds to hand,  there is precious little ST stuff 
there,  but  some  really great Canon BJ10e bubblejet printers  at 
œ180.00,  and  486SX computers at œ875.00,  the software is mostly 
old  crap that nobody in their right mind would buy,  and seems to 
be ancient games of a jerky, dull and trivial nature....'

'If you accept this mission,  this tape-recorded message will self 
destruct in 15 seconds....     ......BLAM!!....   .....Aaaagh!...

Boy,  talk about getting no advance warning, this show could quite 
easily  be  summed  up in this fashion,  but here  are  some  more 
detailed accounts...

"Ahar aha, Capt'n Ahab here!! The show was several leagues distant 
from  the old Spanish Main at Wembley Arena,  just a cutlass-blade 
width  from  the famous football stadium,  easily reached by  Car, 
train and underground services,  and also pirate galleon... Scurvy 
landlubbers  with  advance tickets could make their  way  straight 
down the plank, er, I mean in...."

"Excuse  me,  is Mr 'Ahab' Reginald Buttkins to be seen  anywhere, 
we're  XXXXX  (Name  deleted  to  protect  the  innocent)   social 
services,  with  particular  responsibility for sad  old  deranged 
people, it's his bedtime now.."

"Aha  har har,  oh shit,  time to leave.."  (Exuant 'Capt'n Ahab', 
rather hastily, sharp left...)

 So what was really on offer??

Well  there  were  the aforementioned Canon  BJ10e's  at  œ180.00, 
according  to  Nathan G.  who was on the FutureWorld  stand,  many 
companies  were selling at these cutthroat prices,  simply to  get 
some money into their bank accounts, many of the deals at the show 
having  little  or  nothing to do with normal  profit  margins,  I 
would  assume  this  being due to  the  economic  recession,  with 
associated lack of consumer confidence..  So if you had the money, 
some genuine good bargains were to be had...

Unfortunately,  dear  readers,  the  author  of this piece in  the 
throes  of house-buying,  and NOT HAVING A PENNY TO SPARE did  not 
enjoy  this situation as much as he might have done,  also  having 
got a Canon BJ10e fairly recently as well... 
(With  reference  to  the  above,  new address to  follow  in  due 
course:- Chris H..)

There were even some new ST products,  or established ST products, 
re-warmed  for the show,  there was HISOFT's first show appearance 
of  DEVPAC  3,  the  umpteenth  appearance  of  POWER  COMPUTING's 
ULTIMATE  RIPPER  cartridge at a show price of œ25.00,  and  their 
line of new disk drives, the PC880B with the built in Blitz-Copier 
hardware..

With the sudden demise of MPH, who were due to appear at the show, 
it  was  left  to Microdeal to represent the ST  musical  side  of 
things,  with  the  most space on their stand given to the  STEREO 
MASTER sampler,  including 12 and 16bit versions, also, musically, 
there  was  a rather tasty set-up by ROLAND,  with some  seriously 
enjoyable  synth-type  hardware,  but problems with the  cash-flow 
stayed my hand there, too...

ROMBO, had their latest version of VIDI-ST on display, with proper 
capture  of  full  colour  images,  the  RGB  splitting  now  done 
electronically,  instead  of  using filters,  so good 512 or  4096 
colour images are now possible on the ST..
 
Whilst waiting for their 4.0 version GFA Data Media were promoting 
the  3.5 version of their famous BASIC interpreter,  which is able 
to  support  STE functions,  but a major re-working is awaited  in 
4.0..

FUTURE  PUBLISHING were there,  with the January (Xmas) edition of 
ST  FORMAT,  but  without  the editorial staff,  most of whom  had 
attended  a  'successful'  Christmas party the  night  before,  by 
'Successful'  we  assume only limited casulties,  and use  of  the 
Betty  Ford  Clinic's extensive treatment  facilities!!  Providing 
that the 3.5 inch disk in question is not lost/used as an esoteric 
beermat,  a  review  of  Maggie 8 should appear  shortly  in  that 
esteemed  publication..  (If  they  slag us off,  then  this  will 
embarass them no end.. (He he he he he!!))

Software company representation was fairly limited, as tends to be 
the  case,  but VIRGIN GAMES bravely appeared,  a catologue fished 
off  the  stand reveals such delights as CONAN  THE  CIMMERIAN  (a 
cinema-going barbarian?!?!!?) aka "Mr Big Muscles - little  willy" 
and  co-starring "Spangly Tinfoil Skimpy-bikini woman" in  a  P.C. 
compatible  adventure-thing,  FLOOR  13,  "Now YOU TOO can be  BIG 
BROTHER!!" simulator, JIMMY WHITE's WHIRLWIND SNOOKER, and ROLLING 
RONNY, to name a few..

There  was also the rather dippy Mandala 'virtual  reality'  stand 
with  a  system demonstration that just served  to  convince  this 
writer that VR is still at a very early 'Novelty for prats'  stage 
of  development (I would loved to be proved wrong,  but whilst  on 
the  subject of VR,  I tried out the 'W' Industries system at  the 
Picadilly Trocadero recently,  the game was a racer - Not the best 
idea - and was disappointing, mainly due to the fact the responses 
were awful, a good idea ruined by bad implementation..)


Of the manufacturers, AMSTRAD was there with the 'new' 5286 range, 
a 286 AT P.C.  marketed as a 'home' system for around œ900.00.  It 
 will  be interesting to see if this already dated set up sells  in 
any quantity this Xmas...

There  was quite a large ACORN computers contingent,  with the big 
news  there being the launch of the Archimedes version  of  ELITE, 
only  six  years to wait for this!!!  This is allegedly  the  most 
advanced  version  of  the great game yet,  with features  in  the 
manual put in originally as whimsy,  now implemented on the 32-bit 
RISC  machine..  The game itself looked little different from  the 
original from where I was standing though..

The  only ST/Amiga PDL was the 16/32 PDL,  who was pleased to  see 
issue  8 of MAGGIE,  and judging by the very high activity  levels 
around  the stand,  there must have been a very large number of ST 
and  Amiga  owners who were expecting more than they got  at  this 
show..  Picking  up  a  number of disks,  including some  WILDBOYS 
module  collections,   and  a  few  demo's  this  being  the  sole 
investment of the day by me..

There was also a 'Cupboard on a spring' type simulator,  sponsored 
by Commodore,  again, I declined to take part.. Also on one of the 
stands,  a  CDTV demo of 'The new Psygnosis game' mentioned in the 
CES Show article, I wonder how long before the real thing is out??

To sum up, the 'Shopper is more and more a hardware buyers bargain 
Mart,  every time,  there is no doubt that for anybody looking for 
new  kit,  some  real  bargains were to be had,  but  for  anybody 
looking  for  matters  of interest,  software wise,  with the  odd 
snippets excepted, there is little but disappointment, most of the 
stallholders barely concealing their disinterest in the show..

The journey home went via Watford Junction,  in an effort to avoid 
the London pre-Xmas shopping crowds, but the long wait for a train 
at,  what must be one of the bleakest, freezing, bare-assed places 
in  the Northern Hemisphere set a perfect seal on a  rather  muted 
day..

 (SOME  LATE NEWS:-) Atari are actually set to appear at  the  next 
16-Bit  Fair in mid-February 1992!!  This show is now to appear at 
the Wembley Arena too..
