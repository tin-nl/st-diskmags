                  BY CHAOS (NO, NOT CHAOS INC!)

                    Review by Slime and New Mode
 

At  least  a decent demo from the land of the lefties (we  mean  the 
strange traffic rules here, haha).

After  their rather mediocre demo called "Double Doozer",  Chaos  is 
back with their second mega demo.  This time it's lots  better,  but 
that wasn't THAT big problem.

Another  screen-to-screen review,  since all other types of  reviews 
suck in our opinion.

‰Intro:
 
Good  Chaos  logo  by  Spaz,   excellent  "present"  logo,   obscure 
background  picture  and a ridiculous sample like in  Mindbomb  make 
this intro somehow a bit boring.

‰Menu: 

Oh    no!     Another    one    of    these    "highly     original" 
IHAVETOWALKAROUNDANDSEARCHFORAGESTOFINDASCREEN    menus.    Parallax 
background  scrolling  (although just 75% of the  screen  is  used). 
Control via cursors is a bit jerky.  Graphics are ok,  the animation 
of your sprite is though quite fast and makes it look shit.  What to 
say more?  No scroller,  just a pure selector for your screens. It's 
kept  in memory,  that's a positive  aspect.  Nothing  mindblasting, 
really. Could have been better, though.

‰Confusion: 

A multipart screen like they came in fashing nowadays.
Part 1: Rotating ball made out of vector plots (flickering rasters!)
Part 2: Hill vu-metres. Rotating. Neat.
Part 3: xyz-disting one plane logo, moving explosions
Part 4: same xyz-logo, cycle dister
Part 5: again the logo, ball field. Good work.

This one's damn hard to review. Part 2 and 5 are very good, the rest 
is just average.

‰Rasterblast:

 Left/right  overscan screen.  Nice colour effects and  big  scroller 
with  parallax disting effects inside.  Colourscroller and  digidrum 
music make this screen worth watching. (There are some problems with 
colours in the borders,  Ben!.  Your scroller starts too early  with 
the splits.)
 
‰Culushock:

 Not  again,   they  say  in  their  loader.   Average  Chaos   logo, 
bytescroller, and a colourshock with nice colours but some technical 
problems  in  the  borders.  We really had enough of  this  kind  of 
screens (especially we can say that!).

‰Acid Demo: 

ACIIIIIIIID...  Although Tekkno has taken over Europe (dress up with 
your vacuum cleaner and get our your toothbrush, miip miip miip), we 
have  another  one  of these nice psycho earblasters  like  ZONK  in 
Crikey.  Very  nice colourcyclers,  new original effects and a  good 
stomping music make this a very much pleasing screen. We will reload 
this one again, and that says everything about any screen.

‰Mega-3D: 

Many  different  new techniques build up an  interesting  screen.  A 
zooming  text  explains  all different parts.  First  we  have  some 
lightsourced 3D objects,  then gouraud shaded cubes,  texture mapped 
graphics and 3D-circles.  All of these effects have never been  seen 
in  any ST demo so far.  Pretty original all of those and all  quite 
well done.

‰Bitmap-Mania:

 The usual bitmap bollocks that give us the creeps.  Nice but boring. 
Yawn!

‰Dister:

 Spaz' Chaos logo. Pretty neat colours. The main effect (some kind of 
xz-disted  chessboard)  ranges  from excellent  to  crap.  The  logo 
flickers sometimes, that's really strange. If there wouldn't be some 
crappy waveforms, this screen would have been quite impressive.

‰Loading-Screen:

 A nice texture-mapped disk rotated around,  a small scroller and  no 
music. This one's original and well done.

‰Reset-Demo:

 Approx. 200 double-sine 2plane balls are flying around and some text 
tells  you  all about the credits (although 90% of the stuff  is  by 
Ben).  A nice thing is that you can exit this resetdemo with a  jump 
onto your spacebar. Looks good!

Before we forget, infront of every single screen there's a beautiful 
calculated  picture that fades in and out.  All of them  are  really 
pretty.

 
ˆGENERAL RATINGS:
 
Demo           : Pandemonium Demoˆ
 Group          : Chaos
Coding         : 8
Graphics       : 6
Music          : 7
Originality    : 8
Overall        : 7.75 (after a very  hard dispute about 7.5 or 8)

All  in all,  Ben,  this demo is really excellent.  If you  keep  on 
improving  that much like you improved from your last demo  to  this 
one,  you will be the best coder in the UK, no doubt. All the little 
things like flickering and the sometimes disgusting graphics made us 
put down the overall rating by one point.
