  Ok,  its  time  for  some more info on games  that  seem  really 
exciting,  but  don't turn up for ages,  say 5-6 months after they 
have  been  reviewed by most magazines in a 'good'  case,  as  for 
things like 'EPIC' well don't ask!!!!

But  the end for this particular long drawn out  development  saga 
could  be  in  sight????  A release date of Jan/Feb '92  has  been 
suggested, it seems like the Digital Integration team have been at 
last  able to finish EPIC,  having delivered the goods on  ROBOCOP 
III  first,  (It seems I was correct in assuming that ROBOCOP  III 
was to be released ahead of EPIC, we may see this game in time for 
Christmas,  as  part of a two-pronged assault by Ocean on the Xmas 
Charts, the other 'prong' being TERMINATOR II...)

One  of  the  other famous absentees BIRDS  OF  PREY  (See  MAGGIE 
passim) is now on official trade release schedules,  but these are 
about as flexible as MAGGIE release dates, maybe in '92???

Now,  for a change,  there are some games JUST OUT,  these include 
HUDSON  HAWK,   the  reputedly  reasonable  licence  game  of  the 
reputedly awful Bruce Willis film, and LOTUS 2, both of which have 
been sighted in the local computer Emporium-type place... 

Still some way off are POPULOUS II, which may be out by the end if 
the  year,  if that pig at the controls of the Cessna flying me to 
the  Bahamas  is to be believed..  POP' II,  as expected is a vast 
enhancement  of  the original,  with 30 effects,  instead of  just 
nine,  and  these effects can be combined with others for  greater 
lethality..   POPULOUS  II  has  a  ancient  Greek  setting,  with 
recognisable male and female little people, runs a lot faster, (It 
seems the original graphics system was only a pale shadow of  this 
one..)  There  are facilities such as a full screen  view  of  the 
 action now possible,  oh, and it currently runs in 1 Meg and above 
configurations only..  As this is likely to be THE top release for 
either  '91 or '92,  a RAM upgrade is a good Xmas 'prezzy,  do you 
not think??

BULLFROG  are also currently working on a new isometric  adventure 
game provisionally titled 'BOB' and work is underway for FLOOD  2, 
they are sure to maintain their position as one of the premier  UK 
development teams through 1992...

APOCALYPSE  is the '90's adaptation of CHOPLIFTER,  to be released 
by Mirrorsoft, at some point in Spring 1992, this game is expected 
to  have a lot of enhancements over the original,  without  losing 
the originals playability (They all say that, don't they??)

(Here comes page 2...)


System 3 have two games of the 'fairly long-awaited' type due  out 
anytime soon,  these being LAST NINJA 3,  converted from the Amiga 
version,  there has been a successful trasfer to 16 colour format, 
and  sampled sound effects will be retained...  Also MYTH,  a game 
that  has been around for a long time on other formats  (including 
8-bit) before reaching the ST...

FIRST SAMURAI and DOUBLE DRAGON III sit in the beat-em-up  corner, 
the  major  difference is that the Samurai has a  large  sword  to 
put in the enemies 'where the sun don't shine regions' whereas the 
Lee brothers in DOUBLE DRAG' have only their knuckles and  booties 
to  punish  with  (For the most part..) Again,  we  may  see  this 
anytime before Xmas!?!?!

Coin-Op  conversions MEGA-TWINS (or MEGA-cute) and 'CISCO-HEAT  or 
due  out  soon  as well,  for one just go 'vroom-baroom'  and  the 
other, just throw up if you don't like having something like a 'My 
Little Pony' on the end of your joystick..

 BUDGET CORNER, the following are now out for œ9.99 or less:-

IMMORTAL,    FLOOD,    BLOOD   MONEY,    RESOLUTION   101,    RICK 
DANGEROUS,ROBOCOP,  CASTLE MASTER,  THUNDERSTRIKE, and ESCAPE FROM 
THE  PLANET OF THE ROBOT MONSTERS,  to name but some of the better 
ones,  most  of  the  above  were  fairly  respectable  full-price 
releases in their day, and may well be worth a look at the reduced 
prices...

Imminent data-disk additions to well known games, 'Oh no, not more 
Lemmings'  (Or  something  to that effect.)  and  the  POWERMONGER 
'World War One Edition' The LEMMINGS data disk is not LEMMINGS  II 
by the way, it will be interesting to see what emerges there... 

In  spite  of  the fact that CRUISE FOR A  CORPSE  has  really  to 
appear,  interest  is  switching  to the next  impending  release, 
ANOTHER  WORLD,  which includes the best adaption of the  Delphine 
'Cinematique'  system,  including  panoramic,  close-up views,  and 
making extensive use of 3-D polygons, surely a first for a graphic 
adventure??..  Probable  release  for 'early '92'  (Whatever  that 
means now???)

For MicroProse,  really nice things have been said about their new 
racer FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX (see the ECES Show report..) This sim 
being produced by Geoff Crammond,  he who wrote REVS,  for the BBC 
Micro eons ago...There is also the team-up between Microprose  and 
Argonaut  Software,  the result of this called ATAC,  an anti-drug 
combined strategy/flight sim set in Central America, with Argonaut 
in  charge of the flight-sim part of the game,  expect good things 
to  happen  soon(ish),  Argonaut promising a 'Fully  realised  3-D 
world' with hills,  mountains,  cities,  jungle,  plantations, the 
usual  sort  of  thing,  in other words..  There may not be an  ST 
version though, more news as we have it...


A320  AIRBUS  is Thalion's attempt to 'do' a Sublogic,  with  this 
painstakingly  authentic flight-sim of the best-selling  airliner, 
 release  dates  are  uncertain,  as advertising is at  the  early, 
'Let's  build up the air of mystery by not giving too  much  away' 
stage,  but it may even be out as you read this????  We are led to 
expect  another flight sim soon,  this time based on a German make 
of helicopter..

IN THE SHOPS as we write, a week before Xmas..

ROBOCOP  III,  ROBOCOD  (Try not to get too confused folks..)  and 
POPULOUS II (Amiga, but expect ST versions to follow hard on their 
heels..) Also seen around, two new ones from Psygnosis, LEANDER, a 
semi-cutesy  platform  game,  and BARBARIAN II,  the long  awaited 
successor  to the original,  which was arguably Psygnosis's  first 
decent game on the ST..  Also NOT MORE LEMMINGS,  a busy month for 
them, it seems..

Merry 'Xmas thing,  do not let Auntie buy ANYTHING for your ST, it 
may well turn out to be Naffsoft's PATTERNED SOCK SIMULATOR!!

STOP  PRESS:- The latest Llamasoft shareware game 'Revenge of  the 
Mutant Camels is now out!! See here for a review real soon...

Chris.H. (C) December, where else??
