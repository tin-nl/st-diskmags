Dear TLB,

   I  am  writing  to  you  concerning  the  review  of  the  DEMO 
CONSTRUCTION  KIT by Jinx of DMA.  I wrote to Jinx at the  address 
supplied a couple of months ago,  including an international reply 
coupon and SAE asking for details of price etc.

So  far,  there  has been no reply,  and I am wondering if he  has 
moved,  or whatever, since the review appeared in MAGGIE 4, and if 
so,  how  I can get in contact with him as I still wish to  obtain 
the program..

 Yours faithfully (Etc..)


(CIH‚ WRITES:-)  Well any news since the article in Maggie  4  from 
either  Jinx,  or anybody connected with the DEMO CONSTRUCTION KIT 
would be appreciated.  You may well bear in mind that the 'Review' 
in  issue  4,  was  in fact a preview by the author,  and  not  an 
independent review by any of the Maggie Team,  if a review copy is 
forthcoming  for  full evaluation,  we would appreciate sight  of 
this if possible..

Dave may also like to bear in mind that two months is often not an 
excessively  long time for replies to correspondence!!  Let's hope 
that Jinx replies soon...

 Chris H....
