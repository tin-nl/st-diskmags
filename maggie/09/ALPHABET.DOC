Syphilis..
 

               An Alphabet Guide to the 5th 16-Bit Show...

 By CIH.......


'A' is for.........

Atari , for starters, after about 18 months absence from any of the 
UK  shows,  they  turned up with their big stand,  and about  time 
too..  To  be  found were a number of things I'll mention in  good 
time.. Also for Alliance Year After  demo, (a nice screen by BMT ..)

'B' is for.......  'Boxshifter',   the time-dishonoured practice of 
flogging off old tat shunned in the stores..

British Rail , who did the honours for travelling, with no cock-ups 
this  time..  Atari  Book ,  the  new  A4 sized notebook  ST,  just 
released in the UK, a real neato bit of kit for anyone with approx 
1200 to spare...

'C'  is  for,  Commodore  Amiga,   said to "Look cheap" by the  new 
triple-x  secret  machine,  Atari are due to release later in  the 
year..
Also..
Cold,  long wait in the queue,  before the doors opened at 10.00am, 
 also,  Car ,  which I decided against taking,  as it costs œ6.00 to 
park  the  thing  in London..  Good job really...  Crap Food ,  the 
commonmost catering found at these shows,  I brought my own (See:- 
'Good  Food'  very  rare  item..) Calamus  on  the  TT,  which  was 
demonstrated by a nice person from Atari Workshops..

'D'  is for,,,  Drunk  I encountered when I returned to Northampton 
 Railway station.. (He was of the football supporting variety..)

'E' is for,  Eddie  of the Happening Boiz, who accompanied Leon and 
Me  in our anguished Zombiewalk around the show,  a very OK person 
by me.. (Comes complete with fully working set of Cunning Demos ..)

'F' is for,.,.  so called Fast Lane  tickets, the only difference is 
that the 'Fast Lane' queue does actually move!!  also Food  (Good), 
some  Austrian smoked cheese sandwiches I made myself,  about 900% 
cheaper than the stuff on sale at the show too..

'G' is for GFA Basic , still on version 3.5..

(Free   Space  for  Advertising:-  What  ever  happened   to   the 
Carebears??  and  what is happening to TCB Tracker version 2.0,  a 
switch of distributors was announced, it is now handled by nobody.

'H'  is  for  Hisoft,    who  have  Devpac  3,   but  on  Commodore 
Gamesmachine only..  And it stands for Happening Boiz ,  (Gad,  you 
can  tell I'm getting desperate..) Also for  Head Bags,   A  certain 
brand  of "Off the Bum" shoulderbag,  usually worn in the  crowded 
gangways  at  computer shows,  and in the aisles of W.H.Smith,  by 
people  who  seem to feel the need to have a  third  buttock,  and 
cannot  be  bothered  to grow it by the time  honoured  method  of 
consuming huge quantities of beer and lard..

'I' is for  Every time I try to type in at this point,  the machine 
falls  over  and  goes back to the desktop,  so I lose  what  I've 
wri....

'J'  is for 'JAM'  or 'Just Amiga Monthly',  a fanzine of the paper 
variety that apparently manages a monthly issue Mike!! In spite of 
their  being  afflicted with ownership of the  wrong  computer,  a 
bunch  of really nice guys,  I had a good long chat with them  and 
compared scars, er, notes...

'K' is for......  KY Jelly, perhaps?!?!?! Karsmakers, Richard , When 
 is  the  next issue of 'ST-News',   bet you we can hold  on  longer 
for the release of our next issue than you can!!!!!
 (You  may have started to suss that not all of these  entries  are 
strictly about the 16 bit show.. Well tough!!!)

'L' is for ....  Leon,  a fellow traveller around the great echoing 
halls  of Wembley,  also Atari Lynx ,  there was an 'arcade' of the 
diminutive handhelds on the Atari stand,  also Lightning  Demo,  by 
the  Pendragons,  which  features a very nice plasma show  by  the 
Overlanders   (Whom  I  understand are now no more,  on the  ST  at 
least??)

'M' is for....  Mental Hangover , an Amiga demo by Scoopex converted 
to  the  STE,  by  the Pixel Twins,  Some of it bears  an  uncanny 
resemblance  to their recent Stupendous Demo ..  Also describes  my 
state of mind,  on the train ride home, (Mental Hangover, that is, 
not the letter 'M'..) Also for Maggie , which took Atari by storm!! 
and even for Mega STE,   shown by Atari,  only a year late, clearly 
an  attempt  to defy the rule,  "I don't want it good,  I want  it 
Tuesday!" Better luck next time??? Also Microdeal,  the survivor of 
the 'Tracker Wars' with MPH..

'N' is for .....  Nathan,  who now goes under the  Nom de Ordinateur  
of  'Dalton',  put in an appearance on the 'Futureworld' stand  on 
Sunday, as indentured slave labour or something..
 (Really??  Slaves  with dentures,  I thought they just used to let 
all  their  teeth drop out and work them to  death  anyway..  Well 
well, whatever next!!!)

'O'  is  for..  Odd whirling thing  a bit like an  astronaut  zero-
gravity  simulator on the cheap,  in which people were invited  to 
sit  in  it for a Pound a time,  and whirl and whirl around  until 
violently sick, or something..

'P'  is  for..  Power  Computing,   the same products,  again..( See  
Microdeal.. ) Plastic Glasses , for beer, etc..

'Q'  is  for..  Quantity   of computers on sale,  quite  astounding 
really..

'R' is for.  Riverdene PDL,  who had a stand, and stood up a lot on 
the Atari stand,  doing a P.D. workshop or something.. Roland,  who 
appeared in a cloud of gold dust.. (What?!!?)

'S',  A very important letter,   including ST's  of course, Sixteen-
Thirty two PDL ,  who gladly took on the New Maggie, Southwest PDL , 
(Who  didn't,  preferring  to wait for Budgie to come up with  the 
goods..)

'T'  is  for 'TT'  the rather nice top end Atari,   there have  been 
some recent price cuts, so I hear.. Plenty of these in evidence on 
the Atari stand..

'U'  is  for   'Uckle' the strange noise which  comes  out  of  the 
drainage  plug  of the next urinal to you when you are  in  silent 
contemplation, apart from a certain low hissing noise that you are 
helping to create.. (Can  anybody  think of anything else to do with 
the letter 'U'?? Thought not....)

'V'  is  for,   Vicks  Vapour rub,  someone  must  have had a  bottle 
somewhere in the show,  (Great drink!!) Also Very Interesting , the 
prevailing  view expressed when some Atari people saw our issue  8 
article  about  the  Enhanced  STE,  or 'STEE' (They  went  a  bit 
nonplussed when asked for any specific dates for it though..)

'W' is for,  "Where's the exit??"

'X' is for..  .......... Oh hell......

'Y' is for,  You  can't think of an entry for 'Z' can you!

'Z' is for.. .'ZZZ'  rudely interrupted at an unearthly early hour, 
to get up to go to the show in London..  (See!  I knew it could be 
done!!!)
