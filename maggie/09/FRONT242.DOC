here, or you know that something listed here is wrong, please
e-mail me at weitzman@cambridge.oracorp.com, and I will update

The times listed are taken from the CD or LP covers, unless the
difference between the time my CD player shows and the time on the
jacket is greater than +/- 3 seconds, or there is no listing on
the cover, in which case the time my CD player shows is listed.

matrix numbers, to Vidar Hanssen for lots of import information,
and to Al Crawford for personnel information.

*  Not on CD.

** CMS only.

+ This has been re-released by Wax Trax! in a regular jewel box.
  The original packaging was a slim-CD-single box.

(A little explanation about the different configurations: The 12"
 has a 33 rpm side with the first five songs on it and a 45 rpm
 side with Never Stop! (v1.1) on it, same as on the 33 side except
 for the fade-in and fade-out. The cassette has all eight songs in
 this order on both sides. The CD just has the first five songs
 (presumably because you can access Never Stop! (v1.1) without
 the fades if you want to).)

(This has been re-released by Epic. The differences are as follows:
 12" only: On the old version, the times are listed above the symbols
           and the credits below them. On the newer version, all of
           this is below the symbols.

 CD5 only: The back used to be a "manila yellow," now it's a sort of
           orange-brown overhead landscape-type picture.

           The picture on the front used to be smaller to allow the
           words Tragedy > For You < to appear in black on the
           remaining white space. Now the picture bleeds all the way
           out to the edge, so the title runs down the side in white
           on top of the picture.

 Both 12" and CD5: The binding on the edge used to have parentheses
                   around  For You , now the words are surrounded by
                   the two triangles.
                   
                   This time on the Slo-Mo mix has now been corrected,
                   and reads 4:30. The old version claimed the song
                   was 4:39.

                   The RRE logo is missing on the older version.

 I don't know about differences on the cassette.)

                   Tragedy >for you< 12" VOX
 

With that skill that was hers alone
she drove her clutches into me I was dumbfounded
she was hungry, she required me entirely
all that's left is here to remain
it's a dull and cruel pain
that passes the ages unaltered her scent in my heart
I still feel disemboweled
I clearly retain
a planet
the void

the sore in my sole, the mark in my heart, of acid rain
guts and bloods and needed action start to run
guts and bloods and needed action start to run
the sore in my sole, the mark in my heart, of acid rain

red rover, red rover send David right over

and that voice
that was hers alone
still resounds in me
 she left me dislocated
shes devoured me and ditching her enemies in my heart
she's inspired in me an acute sense of treachery
guts and bloods and needed action start to run
guts and bloods and needed action start to run
I clearly retain
needed action start to run
a planet
needed action start to run
the void

guts and bloods and needed action stands around
of acid rain
