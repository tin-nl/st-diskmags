 
          Tha' Noo Address......

 It is now 8:15pm,  or 8:15-Hundred hours,  or 20:15hrs, on the 6th 
January  1992,..  This  is my first 1992 Maggie effort,  and  also 
notably, the first post-move-from-Northampton piece..

I suppose you want to know where I live now, very well, it is at:-

  (Chris Holland or Maggie Correspondence..)
    84 North Street
     Rushden
      Northants NN10 9BU  (England..)
 
 For all future MAGGIE correspondance in the UK.. (The old address 
is  still ok to write to,  but it may be a few days later before I 
get any correspondence from there in future..)

(The new address is Mine all Mine!!  (And the repayments...)

(I am still trying to work out how I got so many computer  maggies 
in  about two and a half square metres of storage space..  I  have 
had to throw most of them out,  but I kept some of the 'best' ones 
which I will write about in the not too distant future.. How about 
a  1985  edition of 'Your Computer',  or a May 1984 edition  of  a 
maggie called 'Big K' (We shall never see their like again...))

Moving  house  is  bastard hard  work ...  Especially  putting  the 
computer  desk  together,  that I am now writing this article  on. 
This was a so-called 'Self assembly' unit,  so I waited for a very 
long time,  but it remained in a heap of metal, bolts, and plastic 
on the floor..

It eventually dawned that I would have to put it together  myself, 
and  the  'self-assembly'  bit was a despicable  lie  put  out  by 
unscrupulous furniture retailers for their own ends..

 It  also turns out that the original model must have been  screwed 
together by Arnold Schwartzeneggar (Oh, those shelves..) But I did 
it in the end!!   (Today..)
 
I have also (As of the 5/1/92) had enough of moving boxes and very 
heavy  furniture items up and down stairs For a very long time  to 
come...   (I am still wondering where the 'Xmas holiday went  to, it 
seems to be one long blur of packing cardboard boxes..)

Not  to  mention the havoc that a house move  plays  with  writing 
anything  on  the ST,  I have only just caught up with most of  my 
software,  and  have just now sat down to write for the first time 
in about seventeen days (It certainly Feels  longer..)

Anyway,  I  will  close at this point,  (Mustapha Sleep - the well 
known  knackered  Arab..) I have also got some more STE  demos  to 
review soon... Tata fer now... Chris H...
