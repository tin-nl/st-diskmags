 Or in english: Yo Hello hi and all that bullshit...
 Yep, this is Dark Shadow (Drak Skuggan) of The Invizibles
 of Flexichron typing... pure crap!! It's time to write 
 some real shit.

 Before I start I would like to say that I DON'T mean to
 be cocky.. This is just raw humour (and don't think that
 I have something against the mentioned groups, because I
 don't. I like their productions!).

 A real lamer...

 * Thinks that virus are spread when the disks are in
   the diskbox!!

 * Don't know a shit what assembler is but knows who
   has got the highest score in Mouse Trap (shit-game!).

 * Thinks that AN Cool is the same person as Helmut Kohl.

 * Thinks that The Replicants are politicians (in Kambodja).

 * Thinks that a demo is some sort of a strange fruit.
 
 * Thinks that Cream Crackers are the best crackers around.
   (Cream Crackers is a sort of biscuits, I hope nobody has
   taken this name coz' then I will get a lot of shit).

 * Thinks that The Union Demo is written in pure ST-basic.
 
 * Thinks that SYNC is an african tribe.
 
 * Thinks that TCB is a disease.

 * Don't know what the fuck a file is!!

 * Doesn't say Arggggggggggggghhhhhh....  


 What's the definition of a lamer??
 ----------------------------------
 A lamer is incompetent, good-for-nothing, a beginner, a
 jerk, and a nobody. A lamer can't code, paint or make 
 music. The only thing a lamer is able to do is to load
 a silly game. A real lamer hates demos, virus killers,
 music programs, painting programs and assembler code.
 A lamer always use other crews cracks for his boring
 compact-disks. A lamer often thinks that he is better
 than he really is. A lamer can also be a diva. Everyone
 has been a lamer in the beginning but nobody admits it.
  Lamers often say that they hate lamers ! (??). Nobody
 wants to be a lamer. An anti-lamer is sometimes called:
 Laaaaaaamer! When people hate someone for some strange 
 reason they call him laaaaaaaaaammmmer!!! A lamer is
 almost always a boy (there are very few lamer-girls!).
 The word lamer is used by computer-freaks and many other
 people don't understand the meaning of the word. The 
 lamers are guilty for all the bad things (according to
 some people). I could compare this with an other incident
 but I don't want to. Anyone could be called a lamer.    
 
 Yeah! Argggghhhh... what a boring text. Let's change it!
 Metallicus rulus!!! I thinkus...

 Gurgel, sprak, knaster, fraesssss, aciiiiid !!!!!
 Brain malfunction, formatting brain... braincells to
 go:  5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 all cells cleared. 

 Why do all fucking crews swear so fucking much??
 Bloody shit!! You little fuckhead, stop swearing so
 damned much! I hate those fucking texts... Fuck because
 fuck it's fuck so fuck needless. Bloody boring bloody
 text bloody I've bloody written. Damn shit, damn text.
  
 Now what all people have been asking about: THE
 FLEXICHRON DEMO. Yes, we will release it... 
 sometime!!! Perhaps in 2032 who knows?? Ok, let's
 be serious. We are right know working on some new
 screens. You can't miss it when it's released coz'
 everybody will talk about it... I hope... ehh???
 
 Greetings to: Frank Bertil Egon Sigismund Grunko!!
 Gnekings to: The doors...
 Gretnings to: Hans och greta.
 Grekings to: Alla grekar.
 Gremlins to: Alla gremlar och getter.
 
 Okejjjj, it seems that all groups have this strange
 humour. I've got a terrible headache. Argggh! It
 hurts. And my eyes are really tired of this stupid
 text. I must send a big hello to all my friends and
 contacts, all girls and all other people in this
 world...  
  
 This stupid article is dedicated to all groups thinking
 that they are so bloody good. You have probably wondered
 why the english is so stupid... I just felt weird and
 awfully tired. I think I never will write such a boring
 article again... But there will be more articles!!!

 There are many ST-crews nowadays... too many!! Coz' some
 of em' are very bad (but think they are good). I can't
 think... bloody headache. My english must be bad in this
 article because I feel like hell. 
  
 Never forget FLEXICHRON!!! Greetings pals and see ya in
 our guestscreens, intros and megademos!! Greetings to all
 of you. Greet greet greet greet greet... 
 
 If you wanna contact us then...    find the address...
 elsewhere!!! 
 
 A special greeting to The Respectables for having a female
 member (great idea, equality rules! ehh??) Also a big hi to 
 all the people who went to the 2 Life Crew and TCB party in
 Haninge. Some people were really strange... Great heavy
 metal tune (Battery/Metallica), Paranoia!
 
 I hope that the "new" Union will release a new megademo. By
 the way, will there be more new members?? Delta Force told
 me that there would probably never be any more members of
 The Union (they wrote that in the early beginning of 1991,
 but things change, don't they?). Why not say hello to Delta
 Force?? Don't ask me. HELLO DELTA FORCE.

 It seems like I'm filling up the diskspace so let's burp!
