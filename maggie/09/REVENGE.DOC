 
  I'm really sorry Richard K.
 But I'm not doing a huge long piece
 of  '1984' 
 That is three times the length
 of the review.... So there matey boy...

Yet another Yak megagame concept shareware thingy...

('Dis version reviewed is 1 Meg STE game..)
      By Chris H.... 20/12/91

Phew! That's the title credits out of the way......

As  a registered shareware person,  I recently (About a week  ago) 
received  a Llamasoft release statement concerning the arrival  of 
the latest shareware venture by Jeff the hairy, this being the 16-
bit  release  of  the very old and hairy 'REVENGE  OF  THE  MUTANT 
CAMELS' Which came out on the Commodore 64 back in '83...

Having  sent  off my œ5.00,  an envelope containing a disk,  and a 
rather  stylish  'Anticipal' greetings card came back a  few  days 
later.. Great! I thought, just in time for Xmas, who needs ROBOCOP 
III anyway... Just in time for me to review..

'Revenge'  was  one  of the first "Big" games on  the  early  home 
computers,  featuring,  a  then  incredible  42 levels,  with  all 
manners  of  strange weirdness on screen,  this was  possibly  the 
release that got Llamasoft into the big time, and was the start of 
Jeff's  ascent  (or  descent,  it's up to you  to  decide..)  into 
Cultdom..

 (I remember ads for very early Llamasoft releases such as  'Hover 
Bovver'  and  a Falklands style blitz game on the  VIC  20,  which 
played the U.K.  national anthem at the successful conclusion of a 
level - Oh yes!! This must have been about 1982..)

This  version  of  'Revenge'  was not the  first  on  the  ST,  as 
Mastertronic,  some years ago put their own version out, which was 
not exactly an unqualified success,  as Jeff pointed out,  it took 
five  programmers five months to come up with a game with all  the 
original playability leached out of it..  Even more strangely,  no 
copy of this version was sent to Jeff, so he ended up buying it in 
a software shop in Basingstoke..?.?..

This  version,  was  coded  as  a  follow on  to  the  success  of 
'Llamatron',  the  first  shareware project..  This time there are 
differences in general approach to this..

As mentioned above,  the version I received after sending my œ5.00 
was  the  1 Meg STE version..  What happens is that a  basic  512k 
version  is circulated freely,  then you are offered the chance to 
register and do the following:-

1.  If you are stuck with a 512k STFM, then you get a free copy of 
Colourspace or Supergridrunner..

2.  The 1 Meg STFM version, more samples, more memory, so the game 
runs more smoothly..

3.  STE 512k version,  the samples are put on to the STE DMA chip, 
so  more CPU time available for the game,  some rasters put in  to 
the background..

4. 1 Meg STE version, combines '2' and '3' above..

5. TT version!! Much faster and smoother, twice as many objects on 
screen  as  a standard ST,  described by Jeff as how a  PC  Engine 
version of this would look and run..
 
(I'm not really sure if I want to play the basic 512k version??)

Now  to the actual game itself,  'Revenge' is the progress through 
forty-two  levels  of increasing programmers mental  collapse  and 
delerium of a forty-foot high neutronium death-spitting  cameloid, 
controlled by yourself..

The forty-two levels are more-or-less intact from the original, so 
anybody  who has played this into the ground on the  Commodore  64 
will be right at home,  of course,  there are much more in the way 
of bonuses, smart bombs, health points (Apple icon), more powerful 
lasers,  ripple effect lasers,  extra lives, extra points, for the 
very lucky,  a warp to a later level or oasis..  There is also the 
option,  like in Llamatron, of a computer controlled companion, in 
this case with a marked resemblance to the Goat-man ANTICIPAL, who 
acts as an ultra-smart arse-protector.. (Could use one of those at 
WORK, I think..)

The flip-side is,  that many of the icons do your beast no good at 
all,  these  red-bordered  things,  can kill you outright (Skull), 
slow  you down (Cigarette),  or reverse the horizontal  direction, 
sort of like a 'Ghost Virus' in a game..

The password system allows you to note down the entry code to  the 
next  level,  every  four or five levels or so,  as you stop at an 
Oasis to replenish the camel by unzipping the hump, and filling it 
from a convenient tap!! (This was a sequence taken from the never-
released KONIX game..)

The general idea is to progress through levels,  of such things as 
clouds  raining cats and dogs,  killer telephone kiosks and psycho 
CND logo's, this in the 'This is a Nuclear-Free kiosk level, wacky 
walking sticks (Very hard to kill..) and too many others...

The camel,  walks, jumps, can be controlled whilst in the air, and 
spits omni-directional death wherever you wish it to.. Or hope to, 
 as  the  control method takes a bit of getting used  to,  and  the 
first few plays can be a bit confusing... However, it does grow on 
you,  and  it is possible to work out individual tactics for  each 
level..  If you complete the forty-two levels, then it is possible 
to play again in the 'Red-Hot Zone' and if you complete that,  the 
'White-Hot Zone' (But don't ask me how..)

Graphics are large and chunky sprites,  done by Jeff, with several 
humourous touches, a dead camel-sprite turns into a skeletal camel 
with  a surprised expression,  then a large camel-shaped tombstone 
forms  on  screen,  as a symbolic token of your  current  resting-
place!!!  (Errr,,,Jeff??)  There  are several layers of  parallax-
scrolling on the 'ground',  and lots of background stuff, also, on 
the STE version,  a nice red raster sky.. The graphix resemble the 
original  Commodore  efforts,   with  more  colours,   and  better 
resolution, as a general rule..

As in other recent Llamasoft efforts,  the use of samples has well 
and truly gone to town,  and in here, there are the (usual) gun or 
laser shots,  screams, neighs, (If you pick up an icon..) a baboon 
cackling laughter,  for the 'Gameover' sequence, speech ("You must 
be outta your mind") for when you start, and various bits of music 
too..

Can this be the game to get for Xmas????

Well  you only lay out five quid for a start,  it probably will be 
better  than anything costing œ30.00 (With the possible  exception 
of  Populous II,  or the Lemmings data-disk..) And it will be  the 
only  thing that shows off the enhanced capabilities of your  TT!! 
If you've got one of those.. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR.....

(People  may  well  be  very interested  to  note  that  shareware 
registrations  for  ST  owners are exceeding those  of  the  Amiga 
owning population for Llamatron, Yaaaayyy!!)

(So to the ratings..)
 
GRAPHIX:-  75% - These are very much Minteresque and home-brew  in 
style  (As  usual..)  These  ones  are  better  defined  than   in 
Llamatron, and there is plentiful variety..

SONIX:- 88% - These are even more Minteresque and strange,  almost 
all  concentrated  in the in-game Sonix,  uses the lower  STE  DMA 
resolutions (The sock in the monitor speaker 6.25 khz res..)

PLAYABILITY:-  Mid-Eighties - Initially confusing,  but this wears 
off,  and  yes,  there  is a game in there,  plenty of ways to gain 
bonuses..  Follows  the standard Minter rule 'The faster you play, 
the better it is...'

OVERALL:-  85% - A good revamp of an early classic (As opposed  to 
the bad revamp by M*****tronic..)

(C)  CIH  1991,  with thanx to Llamasoft for the very  informative 
DOC.file  enclosed with the game,  this supplied a lot of  'inside 
info'  on  the  game..  The bits about the  very  early  Llamasoft 
releases came from my own brain, yes I do remember that far back!!

SOME GENERAL HINTS:-

The  computer controlled goatman can either act independently,  or 
can sit on top of the camel as a 'smart' gun-turret..

It is occasionally a good idea to smoke the ciggie, as you stay in 
the air longer and avoid any nasty ground level stuff..

Keep shooting the bad guys, they pump out more and more points..

The  first  two level codes are SIETCH TABA,  and  OLLANTAYTAMBO.. 
(Beware, these may be specific to the 1 MEG STE game???)

(For  some  better hints,  read the DOC.  file that comes with the 
program..)
 
We  also  note  that Richard Karsmakers of  'ST-News'  is  a  keen 
supporter  of Llamasoft's Shareware scheme,  and has even declared 
Jeff Minter a 'Software Saint'.. We of MAGGIE would not go so far, 
and would prefer to use the phrase "Deferred,  pending Psychiatric 
reports.." in any discussion of this person instead.. (Only Joking 
Jeff...)
