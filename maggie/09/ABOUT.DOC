About this issue of Maggie
 

Here's another issue of your favourite Atari disk magazine (or 
maybe not).

Not as many articles as usual, but we had to release it before 
all the articles would have celebrated their first anniversary.

Again here are the instructions for all the poor persons that 
haven't got Maggie 8 v2.0 so far. Ah, yes! Speaking about the 
last issue, we have to apologize for all the slight bugs in this 
particular issue. First, it didn't work on MegaSTE's. Shit. Then, 
due to cutting down the maximum characters each line from 80 down 
to 72, several articles were cutted off after 72. Excuse us, we 
made issue 8.2 in a rush, just to release the new menu. Hope this 
issue is bugfree now (it won't be, we know). Report any bugs to 
any of the correspondances addresses. Donations and ideas are 
also welcome. Ok, now the instructions how to handle this disk 
magazine:

 CURSORS UP/DOWN       ->    scroll up/down 
 LEFT SHIFT + CURSORS  ->  one line up/down
 CONTROL + CURSORS     ->  one page up/down
 C                     ->  change hertz
 M                     ->  toggle music on/off
 F                     ->  find string in article
 *,-,+ (keypad)        ->  go to top/middle/end of article

Rest is handled with mouse. You should be able to find out the 
rest (for example : hold the slider and move up and down).

If you haven't figured out yet:  MAGGIE works on monochrome, too. 

Now, read along and enjoy
