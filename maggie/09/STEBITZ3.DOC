               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

As 1991 disappears up it's Mersey Tunnel, what progress on the STE 
front has been made, if any, we ask..

1991 was not overstocked with new thrills for all of the ST range, 
there  was a huge gap in the first half of the year,  without any 
major demo releases,  and definitely very little for the STE, such 
of these that have reached my notice have been reviewed in earlier 
editions  of  'Bitz...  Generally,  the prevailing standard of STE 
stuff,  is  no  better than the DELERIOUS III demo,  reviewed this 
time last year, it is still the best demo on the STE a year later!
(If  anybody wishes to dispute this,  then for gawd's sake,  write 
and let me know!! You haven't so far...)

There  are encouraging signs of change,  which I will discuss in a 
little while though..

For commercial software, there is even less evidence of the growth 
of  an  STE  market,  again,  such isolated cases as  VAXINE  were 
reviewed  when they reached my attention..  There are also stories 
of the rather forgettable HYDRA where a fully enhanced STE version 
was turned down on budgetary grounds,  by Domark, perhaps with the 
move to machines with bigger (1 Meg) memories and D/S drives, will 
produce a reaction in the STE department also??

Art and music utilities are traditionally more ahead of the  games 
in using a new model's extra facilities,  indeed, such programs as 
CANVAS,  DELUXEPAINT,  and  NEO-MASTER  all had the option of 4096 
colours,  QUARTET 1.5 accessed the DMA chip, and increasingly, the 
various trackers feature STE stereo modes.. The best featured (And 
very  hard  to obtain) AUDIO SCULPTURE goes up to the  full  50khz 
output, and even has provision for a modified STE to output 16-bit 
sound..

 With  more obscure areas,  such as the analogue joystick ports  on 
the side of the machine,  a compatible stick has so far,  not been 
forthcoming..  Atari  are reportedly working on one at the moment, 
but at the same time,  the Mega-STE does not feature these ports!! 
Indeed,  the STFM's are better catered for with the release of the 
analogue  Gravis MouseStick (A touch expensive at  œ70-Odd  pounds 
though..)

To  move on to the future,  the first set of good news is that the 
STE will,  from now on,  be very hard to ignore, as the sole base-
model ST on sale.. A substantial number of machines in use are now 
STE's  and  are  surely now,  and especially after Xmas,  able  to 
form  a worthwhile market in its own right..  The second trend  is 
for  the  bigger memory models to sell well,  one source puts  the 
proportion of 1040 to 520 machines sold,  as roughly equal, (About 
50/50..)


The second trend (I hope) is for an expansion in the Public Domain 
sector,  with  not  only machine specific demos growing,  but more 
famous  crews putting in enhanced features,  such as a DMA  stereo 
soundtrack, and increased colour pallette, and STE only screens..

The  STUPENDOUS DEMO,  by the Pixel Twins is a good example of the 
latter  kind of demo,  this will be reviewed properly when a fully 
working example is received,  but it features several soundtracks, 
that  clearly  make use of the DMA chip,  and at least  two  (Non-
working  at  present)  STE-only  screens,  one of  these  being  a 
DEFENDER-type game..

The SUNDANCE KIDS's MEGABITE DEMO is a machine specific demo,  the 
following review explains all:-

The  demo starts loading,  to reveal a little cartoon person  with 
speech bubble saying "Oh good, another Sundance Kid megademo." The 
intro  screen  loads,  and consists of a large (Non-moving)  logo, 
other  explanatory text,  and a module played via the TCB  Tracker 
 STE routines..

1.  The  main  menu,  a very sparse affair,  with a bouncing logo, 
border  scrolly-text,  and a barrel-scrolled menu-selector for the 
different screens,  this one is very quiet as there is no music to 
be found..

2.  The  first  screen,  proper,  the obligatory COLOUR DEMO,  with 
3200-colour  Rasters,  a  scroll-around-the-screen  logo,  yes,  a 
scroll  text at t'bottom of screen,  and soundchip music from  the 
TCB early-model TECHTRON demo in SOWATT..  Try moving the joystick 
to get some really interesting (And unintended) effects..

3.  DIGITAL,  not  a  lot  happening,  apart  from a  TCB  module, 
recognisable  as  the  Amiga Wildcopper  tune,  playing,  a  large 
stationary logo-thing, and some other stuff moving up and down the 
screen,  also,  a fairly limited use of colours, so a dull-looking 
screen..

4. HOUSEY, a cross between TECHTRON, and the TLB screen on the OOH 
CRIKEY demo with the very long German name.  Has loads of 'Acidey' 
graphix and samples, but not a patch on the original, still, not a 
bad try..

5. P.D. (Library) ADVERT, a nice gold-coloured PDL logo, scroller, 
and looping sample,  which corrupts after a while, this is, as you 
might have guessed, publicity for the WORLD OF WONDERS PDL..

6.  WHO  ARE  WE,  a digi-pic slideshow,  on the lines of the DELTA 
FORCE  hidden  screen,  with pictures of the two creators of  this 
demo  for your delight.  The slideshow is controlled by the cursor 
keys..


7.  ROBOCOP 2,  another mini-slideshow,  with a series of samples, 
some of which are described as possibly offensive by the makers of 
this  demo,  again,  the  pictures are controlled from the  cursor 
 keys..

8.  RIPP-EM-OFF,  a  strange  little  game,  which  did  not  work 
properly, the aim being to declothe one of the coders by answering 
some questions correctly.????

And that was it,  it is nice to see someone making the effort, but 
unfortunately  nothing  in  here that was either original,  or not 
already done better on an STFM, better luck next time...

Finally,  before I go,  a little tip for ESION soundtracker users, 
it is possible to load and run TCB Tracker Modules in!!  It is not 
just  AUDIO  SCULPTURE  that has this  capability,  and  the  said 
modules can be saved as 'normal' noisetracker compatible MOD's. In 
most  cases,  the end of the tune appears to be 'clipped-of'  with 
the  loss of some patterns,  but these are still there.  Just move 
the position indicator forward until the pattern number returns to 
zero,  you have now reached the end of the module, and can play it 
in its entirety..

Let's hope there's rather more to write about next year...

  Bitz Supplement....
 
(A Mystery solved...)

 You may remember in a previous edition of 'Bitz' that I reviewed a 
four-screen  demo,   of  French  origin,  with  no  indication  of 
whodunnit?

Krazy Rex of ST-Connexion has written to advise that this demo was 
coded  for Atari France in 1989-90 when the machine had just  been 
released  there  to  boast  the  'Enhanced  capabilities  of   the 
machine..

 At least one Replicant, Dom, was involved in coding, Krazy Rex was 
the  graphix man who drew the Unicorn picture,  it seems that  the 
demo  travelled  further than expected..  So now we  know,  cheers 
Patrick!!
