 A computer game licence that bears some resemblance to the film... 


                       R O B O C O P   I I I 
 

(I just love Big Bold  titles, don't you..)

This  little  number,  seems to have been the product of a bit  of 
inspired  brain-scratching,  for a change..  A number of important 
 firsts  to record here..

The FIRST computer game to appear before the film is released..

The First  game to actually remotely resemble the subject matter in 
question (So it's an impossible thing  after tea  then...)

The   first   licence  by Ocean to  actually  feature  state-of-the-
artness, as part of it's appeal..

Also, the first licence to not consist of a crap platform game (or  
racer, or coin op conversion..)

Some Ocean traditions are not breached, for example, the main game 
is  a  number  (five) of sub-games,  each of which can  be  played 
separately  as an arcade version,  or in strict order,  as a Movie 
Adventure..

1.   A  walk  through  shoot-em-up,  Robocop  stalks  through  the 
corridors of OCP's executive offices blasting terrorists (But  not 
hostages..)  as  he goes,  uses MK XVI police model  hand  blaster 
thingy,   with  built  in  targetting  system,  stalk  the  gloomy 
corridors gun in hand (Very good use of shading here,  a technique 
not  much seen outside of a PC,  it seems..) The action  presented 
from the first perspective in real 3-D..
 
2.  A  driving  game (Ohh nooo,  I hear you cry..) but this one is 
rather  more worthy of the description.  Chase the crims,  and ram 
their vehicles off the road, when you do this, they come to a halt 
in  a  heap  of smoking tangled wreckage,  what fun!!  Solid  3-D, 
again,  with more shades than thought possible on an ST, plenty of 
ground  detail (A whole citys worth.) The vehicle  handles  rather 
well too, (Mouse controlled..)

3.  Another  shoot-em-out  (See  One  above..) This time,  involving 
Splatterpunks  in the old town section of Detroit,  a slummy scene 
(Remember  the  Skid Row demo??) with boarded up  buildings,  etc, 
replaces the plush OCP office battleground..

4. One of the best bits of the lot, The Gyropack flight simulator, 
se  Robocop slug it out with assorted helicopter gunships,  tanks, 
and  ED-209 droids,  armed with nothing more than a feeble handful 
of machine guns,  and smart,  self-targetting cannon...   Also , see 
Robocop  succumb  to  an overdose of hits,  or just fly  into  the 
ground with the help of a careless flick of the mouse, a titanium, 
carboalloy  plastisteel  tentpeg  with five  hundred  man-years  of 
research and development invested in it!!!!
 (Yes,  the  controls are just this side of terrifyingly sensitive, 
but  not  too much of a problem if you stay away from  that  nasty 
hard ground..  )  
 
5.  The obligatory beat-em-up, see the rival, Japanese Otomo Ninja 
droid,  dance,  skip,  pull  off  Double somersaults,  whilst 'Robo 
futily  punches empty air..  (Robocop may have the use of his gun, 
as  well,  but  it is possible for it to get it kicked out of  his 
hands before he can do anything with it..)

So,  enough of that, onto the plot ( There is one..)  OCP, the mega-
corporation of Robocop films past,  has now been taken over by the 
even-more-mega Kanemetsu corporation, the aim to build Delta City, 
out  of the soon to be ruins of Old Detroit..  Before you can  say 
Hackney Borough Council,  the indigenous population are up in arms 
 (The  sniping from the tower block variety of urban  discontent..) 
So   a   collection  of  crop-haired,   piggy-eyed,   bulgy-necked 
collection  of gentlemen known as  Rehabs  act as a kind  of  super-
bailiff,  with  automatic weapons.  Robocop is tasked to help out, 
the  resulting conflict of loyalties to OCP,  or  the People  result 
in this game (Or that film, to be more accurate..)

A satisfactory conclusion should lead to all the bad guys in their 
various forms,  out of the way,  the Old town of Detroit magically 
transformed into Disneyworld,  with all the squatters getting jobs 
as Mickey Mouse (TM - Hem hem!!) The Wizard of Oz safely tucked up 
in bed etc..

In  reality,  playing  the movie adventure option is a hard  slog, 
with  no  save game  positions,  so a lot of practice is needed,  as 
you  only  get a measly 100% energy which seems to  go  absolutely 
nowhere these days..   (I remember when 100% energy used to get you 
through seven  world wars, then down on the town all night, and got 
you a taxi home, with change from a kipper..)   
 
Some other stuff (My thoughts on sound and graffix will follow  in 
the ratings..) It comes on three disks, a lot of the disk space is 
used  for the film-like animated sequences,  and vey high  quality 
still pictures,  also, mucho use of disk space for samples.. There 
is a lot of disk swapping, unless you own a second drive.. It also 
features a new anti-piracy dongle,  which various heartless people 
cracked anyway..

The Super-duper ratings..

Graphix:-   94% - Features the superfast and  super-detailed  solid  
3-D  polygons  first  used  to  good  effect  in  F29  Retaliator, 
interspersed  with several very good animated (Part  bitmap,  part  
3-D  solid stuff) sequences,  and several still pictures which may 
have been taken from the film, but we understand  were  hand drawn.. 
Unbelievable  (for an ST..) use of shading in the  3-D  sequences, 
parts of the game look more like a VGA type screen..

Sonix:-   85%  - Done by the Maniacs of Noise,  a sombre,  powerful 
title  piece,  a  'newsy'  bit for the Mediabreak  sequences,  and 
various samples,  gunshots,  etc, a slight let down in the driving 
sequence,  with  a  weedy soundchip engine noise,  but made up for 
with brilliant crash effects..  Does use the STE's stereo modes.. 

Playability:-   88%  - The whole slots together  effectively,  some 
bits,  more  appealing  than others,  the Gyropack flight sim,  and 
driving game most appealing..  The speed of the 3-D update ensures 
the game handles well (Flight and driving again..) The  beat-em-up 
less convincing though..

Overall:-   89%  - Could well be one of Ocean's best  releases  for 
1992  (We'll wait for Epic  and decide then..) Certainly  the  best 
interpretation  of a licence just about ever,  I think there could 
have been more subject matter,  variation etc, but they would have 
probably  have  run  to  a  fourth  disk   (Wot  abaht  compression 
techniques then!?!?!)  So no serious complaints this time, and even 
a bit of praise for Ocean..
