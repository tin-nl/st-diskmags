                  by Hackbear of DELTA FORCE

             (stuff gathered from various sources)

As we all (at least those of us who cares about Atari) knows by now. 
There is a new machine coming out this autumn from Atari. The name
isn't 100% certain, but we're all so used to "Falcon" now that I'll
stick to it.

Well, CeBit got the ball running. And this article published on Genie 
really started the rumors....

*********************************************************************


====================================================================== 
* CEBIT REPORT FROM GENIE 
======================================================================

 I can't believe it.  Rumors flying around like mad.  Everbody and his 
mother-in-law have their own opinion as to what Falcon is or should be 
or whatever.  But when its announced nobody says anything.  Not even 
Atari. :-(

 Anyway, although I wasn't at the CeBit I do have some first, second, 
and third hand informatation.

 First of all - the machine was only shown to a closed group of people, 
mostly dealers.  It wasn't shown on the floor of CeBit.

 - The Falcon 030 is considered a follow-up machine to the 1040s, its 
  contained in a 1040 case (or at least very similar), and black ala 
  NeXT.

 - 68030 CPU running at 33Mhz, I beleave the whole machine runs at 33 
  Mhz or at least most of it.

 - DSP 56001 Signalprocessor (NeXT).

 - Up to 14MB RAM in simms.

 - Screen sizes, all ST/STE/TT resolutions except 1280*960, plus 
640x480x   65535 (out of 256000 colors), plus some other stuff which I 
forgot (ah,   ability to connect to external signal source).

 - Built-it 2.5" SCSI harddisk (this may still be a rumor).

 - All normal MegaSTE/TT connectors, ST and STE joy stick ports (4 in 
  all), plus a built-in LAN connector and other toys (remember that 
  signal processor).

  - Multi TOS, ya, real live Multi TOS, NOW!.  Thanks guys.  Multi TOS 
  alone is worth dumping my expanded MegaST for a Falcon.

 - Delivery before September (this year).

 - I heard the Falcon should cost less than $1200.00, but with exchange 
  rates the way they are and my bad ears, I may have heard the wrong 
  price.

 Anyway, its plain to see that Atari has a new and wants a new 'low 
end' machine (or a super game machine - the choise is up to you) which 
isn't designed to replace the MegaTT, but designed for the masses and 
which can be sold to the masses.

 Rumor has it that the Falcon 040, the 'high end' machine, is almost 
ready, it didn't make it to CeBit by just a few days, and will be 
announced in September.  Atari didn't say one word about the '040' - 
the rumor came from other sources.

 Great going Atari, meaning everybody who worked on getting the Falcon 
out.  I wish you my best.

 Now lets hear for Bob and John and...

 Frank...

 Editors Note:  We spoke with Atari on the above information and they 
would neither confirm or deny any of it.

Then Leonard was on a GEnie RT and said this:

**********************************************************************


Date: 30 Mar 92 07:09:49 GMT

Leonard Tramiel (Atari's VP of Software Dev.) prefaced his conference
on GENIE with the remark that developers can expect to get their hands
on a Falcon '030 in a couple of weeks.  Developers like Lexicor (makers
of 3D anim., render/painting, and keyframe animation software) got
their machines earlier.

His exact statement follows:

======================================================================

                              March 25, 1992

                          <[Leonard] STRAMIEL> As most of you know, at 
CeBIT in Hanover Atari previewed some exciting new technology.

This technology allowed us to generate extremely high quality graphics 
and sound simultaneously. The members of the press to which this was 
shown were very impressed.

The first product to incorporate these new technologies will be 
available at retail by late fall of 1992 and first developer units will 
be available by the end of April.  This product will have a 68030 as 
it's mainprocessor.  As I'm sure you can appreciate, no further details 
will be available until product release.

**********************************************************************


Tjerk Heymens Visser (Netherlands) added some more:

**********************************************************************
Date: 30 Mar 92 11:11:58 GMT

Since people are doubting the Falcon and Atari so much, I just thought 
that I would just say that I read in Atari ST Nieuws that the Falcon
was released on the CeBit behind the screens, it was shown only to
invited guests. So no wonder I didn't see it.

It has:    - a 68030 processor           
           - True Color           
           - Standard a HD drive           
           - It is prepared to take Multi TOS 
           - Works on 16Mhz for the cheapest model, up to 50Mhz for the
             most expensive model.
           - And a some more things, but I can't remember now.

The first production models will be shown to the public on the Atari 
Messe in DÅsseldorf (21 to 23 August). It would be available in Holland 
about October this year.
Price?   HLF 1500,-. That would be 800 to 900 US Dollars. 1500 guilders 
is about the same price as an Amiga 500 with monitor in Holland.

If anyone doubts that the Falcon will be shown on the Atari Messe, go 
there for yourself! Talk to some people from Atari for yourself,
instead of starting a flame war on the Net !
 
********************************************************************


Another dutch guy said to somebody who claimed Atari didn't show the 
falcon at CeBit:

********************************************************************


Sorry, but the Falcon **WAS** shown at the CeBIT: I read in my (Dutch)
Atari-magazine an article with the following info:       
Introduced to the press the Atari Falcon 030 by Jack Tramiel
68030 processor 16 MHz up to 50 MHz clock speed
1.44 MB Floppy
True Color (16.7 Million colors)
Any monitor can be attached: SM 124, SM 1224, (S-)VGA
16-bit stereo sound
microphone input

Delivered to developers: expected in May 1992
First production-machines expected at the end of summer 1992
Probably exposed at Atari Messe DÅsseldorf Germany in August
Available to dealers expected in fall 1992

        Rumors about the price: Dfl 1500 up  (US$ 850)

*****************************************************************


Vincent says:

*****************************************************************


 Well, I have also gathered infos at the CeBit, and yesterday from 
Atari France regarding the Falcon. Here they are :

 - 68030, 20 MHz.
 - TT rez, with an extended 640*480 VGA rez in 256 colors amongst 64K 
   or 16M.
 - 56001 DSP from Motorola.
 - At least 4 Mb memory - No MultiTOS at start, but it is to be 
   introduced.
 - SCSI Hard disk.
 - Maybe : New chips to achieve zooming and sprite animation in 
   hardware.

 The machine should have the look of a standard 520 ST, that is *NO* 
separate keyboard.

 The Mega STE is bound to disappear (Sorry for those who bought one).

 This new machine should be released by October in France. A prototype 
 is going to arrive at Atari France next month (?). As soon as it is 
arrived, I'll try to take a picture and post it somewhere.

 More infos :

 TT is continued till 94 when it'll be replaced by the Falcon '040.

 TOS 2.07 is still not fully debugged, and Atari is unsure it'll be 
released.

******************************************************************


Jerker (Hi!) started a thread about NeXT being involved in the Falcon 
with this message and was backed up by some other guys:

******************************************************************


Ok that's it. Is there anyone besides me on the net who has heard
rumors about NeXT buying shares in Atari and the Falcon being just
a low-end NeXT?   I have heard the rumors apart from this thread, 
but it does make some sense...
   DSP 56001 as the NeXT, used as sound-chip, just like NeXT. 
   Microphoneinput, just like NeXT.
   68030 suitable for a low-end NeXT.

   ------------------------------

I have heard the same rumor and wondered the same thing.  I posted 
the same kind of "tell me what you know" on comp.sys.next.misc and
got a few responses.  The general consensus was that it is NOT true.
NeXT is a private corporation trying to go public, and the last thing
you do before going public is incur the debt of buying another company 
(although Atari has LOTS  of cash on hand right now).

If the configuration of the Falcon is true, Atari and NeXT would be 
stupid not to release NeXTstep on it.  The original NeXT cube was a 
25MHZ 030 so there shouldn`t be a speed problem.  OS 2.0 sped up the 
system greatly and 3.0 (due in June) is supposed to be faster yet 
contain even more goodies!  I think the combo could really fly. 
(Read: I am too poor to own a NeXT but really want to.  Hey, at least
I am honest.)

Atari could give NeXT the low-end (in terms of "workstation" and cost) 
massmarket they need to compete with SUN/IBM/Apple.  NeXT could give 
Atari a better aura of respectability.   I   know Atari is a real 
company, and  you  know it's a real company, but the DOS/Apple world at 
large still looks at it as either a failure or a game machine.  NeXT 
could produce a cheap 030 machine but they are still trying to shed the 
image that they are slow neat looking cubes.  The new OS is zippier and 
"slow" performance should be acceptable if it doesn't spout the "NeXT" 
label.

 NeXT can raise the expections of what a workstation should be able to 
do and Atari can raise the expectation of what a home computer should
be able to do.
I really think the two of them could put the squeeze on Apple and SUN. 
Apple is slowly bringing their prices more in-line with reality but 
they need a heavydose of Falcon-shock to bring them around!

Irregardless, if the price and features of the Falcon are even 
reasonably close to what is being said now, I want one.  And unlike my 
NeXT fixation, I probably will be able to afford one!

Oh well enough raving for now.  Sorry to interupt your daily schedule.

------------------------------

Ted Brown makes mention of implementing the NeXTstep software on 
the (I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it) Atari Falcon. This would indeed be 
very cool. That is, IF...

* The Falcon has a 68030 at 25Mhz or better, a math coprocessor, and 
a NeXT-level graphic display (it doesn't, from what I've heard. And 
the prototype 80486-based NeXTstep package requires a video board 
beyond even SVGA standards, and is still being developed.)

* The Falcon will run NeXT stuff in color. NeXT color is 
incredible, indeed at such a high standard that implementing it on the 
Falcon would undoubtedly prove too costly.

* Atari and NeXT are actually capable of mutual cooperation. Not 
bloody likely. NeXT Co. will look down their snooty high-end noses at 
Atari and sniff "Go away, I find you offensive." And Atari's management 
would undoubtedly find some way to screw the deal up.

So, I imagine the Falcon, even if a complete 25 Mhz+, 4+Mb 
RAM, math-coprocessor-equipped, 80+Mb HD, monitor-included system can
be had for $2000, will be a failure.

Why?

* It will be incompatible with everything, and no one will want 
to develop for it.

* '386 and '486 PCs with Windows 3.1 keep getting cheaper. I can get 
a 40 MHz '386 with Windows 3.1, 130 Mb HD with cache, 4 Mb RAM, 64K 
RAM cache, 1024*768 SVGA graphics, and an SVGA monitor for under $1800 
now.
Add in $200 for a good sound card and this thing cooks. Soon, 
comparable '486sx or even '486dx systems will be at this price.

* Apple will further reduce the prices of the Mac IIsi and IIci 
models, bringing at least the IIsi down to the $2000-complete-system 
level.

* It won't be out until 1993, or maybe even 1994.
 
Eh, what's the use. I'm getting out of the Atari market as soon as 
I have the bucks. My 1040ST was a good deal in 1987, but nowadays, 
forget it.

------------------Patty (AIM) writes:

Perhaps what you're forgettin is that Steve Jobs originally worked 
for Atari before he designed the Apple, and that I'm sure there's lots 
of bad blod between Steve Jobs and John Scully.  This is what makes 
the idea of a Next/Atari deal so exciting, and plausible!

But, as always with Atari, we'll have to wait and see.  If Atari 
wins the lawsuit with Nintendo, the Tramiels will have mega-bucks, and 
Jack could just close the company down and go off with all the cash.

Other people naturally asked about Midi ports:

pinelr@aix.rpi.edu (Robert Jeffrey Pinelli) writes:

I have heard a lot of talk about the Falcon in this newsgroup and it
sounds pretty good (16.7 mil colors standard! go atari!)  I was 
wondering if anyone knew if it had the standard midi ports built into 
it like every other 680x0 computer atari has made? It would seem dumb
not to have them, but then again this  is  atari we're dealing with...
Thanks,
       Rob


 In the rumors I've heard, it includes all of the standard ports that 
the other atari lines have(including the Midi ports). I call atari base 
usa locally and speak to their director of communications, Bob Brodie. 
The rumors/semi-facts around that area are that the machine is black 
in color, similar to a 1040 box style, but bigger. The one thing that 
I didn't see mentioned here is the ability the machine has to 
display 63,500 colors on screen simultaneously in one of its modes, and 
also the rumor that its equiped with the same sound chip as the Next.

******************************************************************


The term "True Color" caused some confusion. Here's some definitions:

******************************************************************


 
1. "True Color" is a term used to describe 24bit color computer video.
   At that level of emulation of color (I don't remember the exact 
   number of individual colors available with 24 bits, but it's 
   extremely high... on the order of 99 gazillion..), the human eye no 
   longer can tell the difference between the computer generated image 
   and a "true" photographic image.

   Note that number of colors has nothing to do with the resolution 
   of the image. "True Color" images can be generated in normal VGA 
   resolutions, and some of the color enhancement boards being developed 
   for the ST are going this route, rather than going for extremely high 
   resolutions with fewer colors.

2. I believe true color means more gradients of different color than 
   the eye can tell the difference between (i.e. you can't see discrete 
   color changes in a dark -> light transition).  It usually refers to 
   24 bit color (16.7 million color palette)

3. I've heard it used with reference to 12 bit color (4 bits each 
   R,G,B). I think all it means is that the data stored for the pixel 
   directly controls how much each R,G and B there is on screen. What
   it allows you to do is know what color that data represents directly, 
   and generate the closest approximation to a color without having to 
   look up what colors are in a color table.

   Thus, the screen data represents the "true color" displayed.

   Personally, I prefer Rob's definition (2). More colors than you can 
   see.
   Someone posted before that it has 15 or 16 bit color (as in HICOLOR 
   or 16 bit TARGA). (I realize almost all is rumor, though).

   I think "true color" is marketing-speak, and has no real accepted 
   definition.


4. "true color" in computer graphics generally means you have enough 
   colors to put a different color on each pixel on the screen.

5. In this case, I believe that True Color is meant to represent an RGB 
   direct mode as opposed to CLUT (color lookup table).  So for each 
   pixel on the screen, you say what the RGB values will be (5 bits for 
   each gun perhaps).
   With 16 bits for color information, it would be possible to have 5 
   bits for each of red, green, and blue (as with CD-I RGB555 mode, 
   where the 16th bit is used for transparency), or one could perhaps 
   add an extra bit to one of the colors (with green making the most 
   sense, since it has the most affect on intensity).

   How Atari plans to work out this graphics mode Y will not be able to 
   use 65536 colors from 16 million (lookup table of that size would be 
   absurd).

 
6. With respect to the use of the term "true color" regarding the new 
   Atari machines, these are the words of Leonard Tramiel:

   "BTW, true color does not mean 16 million colors. It means no 
   palette." Source: ST Report #813.

7. This is getting tiresome...

   "True Color" is an empty advertising/marketing term.  In light of 
   the many factors that go into video/graphic imaging, a definition 
   consisting of whether the "human eye cannot tell the difference", 
   without further elaboration on the means by which to make such a 
   judgment, is just as empty.  And 16 million colors, in any sane 
   implementation, implies that there is no color palette. Why not
   just let the term "true color" die and simply ask "how are graphics 
   implemented on the Falcon?"


8. OR Truecolor can mean that the value of the pixel represents the 
   true color that will appear on the screen (or  Ektachrome, or 
   dye-sublimation printer, or Ektatherm  paper or...) as opposed to
   the pixel value representing a vector into a color map ala
   pseudocolor.

   Sorry, when I saw the "sigh", I just couldn't resist! :-)


9. The REAL  meaning of True Color is that each pixel can be assinged 
   whatever color you like - so if each pixel has eight bits of Red, 
   Green, and Blue, then each pixel can have whatever value you wish
   for each of the colors. Normally, you'd have to choose 256 (or
   whatever) specific combinations of those eight bits and that's all
   the colors you could have on the screen (each pixel would have to
   be chosen to be one of the 256 colors). With True Color, you can 
   make any pixel on the screen be any color you want (or as close as
   you can get depending on the number of bits per pixel)

   True Color has nothing to do at all with how many colors there are 
   avialiable.  It's really more of a hardware graphics term. So Mr. 
   Tramiel was right...

10. "a big one"

   The idea of having 16 million colours (24 bits worth), that are 
   simply  chosen  rather than using a palette sounds neat, in SOME
    ways, but is it ultimately ALL  that great?
   (Note: There WILL be an implicit palette, made up of 16M colours, 
   in which the entries are fixed.  Looking at it this way is probably 
   useful in critiquing the idea of "True Color".  It should be noted 
   that I am NOT a graphics programmer, and people who've done such 
   things should be the ones that continue any subsequent discussions...
   Also, as a Canadian, I kind of like British spellings, like "colour" 
   versus the "color" used by those people in North America that live 
    south of the 49th parallel.  We're ALL Americans, whether we live in 
   Canada, Mexico, or the United States.  Of course, the "Americans" 
   that live in Canada get better service from Atari, but that's another 
   issue!)

   1) It means that if some of those colours never get used, whether in 
   a particular application, or possibly EVER (who'd want THAT putrid 
   shade of green?), then that part of the implied palette is wasted. 
   It might be a better use of resources to have a smaller palette that 
   contains the colours that are actually USED.

   2) I have often seen palette switching used to do animation/"editing"
   of pictures.  You change colour #1 from White to Black, which seems
   to be a pretty useful thing.  "True Color" seems to throw this sort
   of feature away.


11.

   The main advantage of a "palette-less" system is in image
   processing.
   With a direct RGB (or other component) method of image storage, one 
   may process the image by standard, linear filtering methods which
   use superposition of image intensity and color information.  Even 
   non-linear techniques are more straightforward.  With a palette 
   system, much translation and untranslation is required, muddling the 
   algorithms.  I would venture that with a palette system, most (image 
   processing) programmers would keep an essentially RGB version of the 
   image in memory for processing and convert it to the palette-ized 
   version for display only.  In this case the palette is inconvenient 
   and doesn't save any memory.

   This is analogous to 12-bit logarithmic encoding of audio as opposed 
   to 16-bit linear.  In many ways, 12-bit system can have comparable 
   fidelity and saves memory/storage.  However, the linear system has 
   many advantages in filtering and other signal processing.


12. "a demo coders view (Paul Donnelly)"

    Yeah, I'm a bit worried about this no-palette stuff. How are you 
    supposed to do vertical twisting scrollers based on hbl 
    palette-flicks if there's no palette??! (e.g. Digital Insanity #1 
    screen on TLB-Mindbomb megademo). I know there's no chance you can 
    have 256 palette registers on a shifter chip without going to some 
    sort of internal ram, but wouldn't a better solution be to make say 
    the bottom 16 colours go through palette registers? I've also 
    programmed Acorn Archimedes. It's 256 colour mode was a REAL  mess. 
    The colour you see was made up from several bits of the at many of 
    the 4096 colours were only available from 16-colour (or less) modes. 
    Why don't these computer manufacturers think before they make 
    thousands of people suffer for 5 years?!!


 
13.
   There's absolutely no reason that truecolor modes (15/16, 24, or 32 
   bit) and palettized modes can't coexist in the same graphics 
   controller.  In fact, every truecolor card I've worked with in the 
   MSDOS world also has palette-mapped modes available.


14.
   Don't forget that there is supposed to be a '56001 DSP on the 
   Falcon.
   This accesses a 24 bit word per memory address. 24bit true colour is 
   the only way to go if this chip is to be used for graphics 
   efficently.
   Since the '56001 can do 1 arith op & 2 moves every instruction cycle 
   it should be possible to do 3d shading at close to full memory 
   bandwidth.
   Then you would have no problem doing "3d gouraud shaded vertical 
   twisting scrollers" without messing about with palette flicks. In 
   fact the '56001 is a demo coder's dream come true - it's purpose 
   built for horribly subtle, amazingly fast assembler hacks.


********************************************************************


Stephen Jacobs asked an interesting question and got a nice answer :-) 


********************************************************************



It just occurred to me to ask who it was that showed the consumer 
68030 box at CEBIT.  If it was a corporate officer, the demonstration 
could be taken as an authoritative statement of where Atari WANTS to 
go.  If the presentation was by a recognized spokesman (right now, I 
think that means Bob Brodie or Bill Rehbock), it can be interpreted as 
a product announcement.  And if the presentation was by a hardware 
person, it would be a show-and-tell of what kind of things Atari is 
working on.  Anyone know who did the show?

It was Jack 'The Terminator' Tramiel!!!!  Yes the MAN from Commodore who 
wiped out the old Atari is back and demoed the Falcon '030s.
When JT does the showing himself you know Atari is serious and about to 
unleash something wild.  When he stepped aside tolet his sons learn the 
ropes Commodore definitely went ahead with the Amigas.  Now all 
Commodore does is keep coming up with only Amigas and nothing else!! 
 Where is all that IMAGINATION??!  Some guy in Isreal posted the 2.1 
updatenotes and now everyone knows that the Amiga 500++ will have only 
256 color!  Notice that their POWER UP/Rebate has been going on forever? 
 Amigans can thank Atari for that, since the A3000 would have to sell 
very low to compete against the Falcon '030s.

 *******************************************************************


Something interesting popped up about peripherals:

*******************************************************************


This is an incredible discussion. Let me add something of a question for 
our best dectives. I have no information, but I just read a pice in the 
April ST Informer about the new peripherals for Atari from 
PeripheralsLand, Inc. This had been mentioned in earlier Cebit reports. 
What was in-teresting is that the PLI spokesman is quoted as saying:

        "We are presently at CeBit in the Atari booth showing our new 
products, which we intend to release immediately. They are all designed 
to integrate with the new series of Atari computers, and are cast in 
the new black color."

Question:     Can someone who knows more about these peripherals deduce 
anything about the upcoming series of Atari computers?

By the way the peripherals are:

    Infinity OPtical drive  Infinity 44 x 88 Syquest Units
CD-Rom (as soon as possible) it sounds like they may have shown 
other things.

Someone added:

I'm not sure about the PeripheralLand drives, but I have a NeXT 
and, though I haven't pokes around it much, it does have a standard 
SCSI interface (no flames if I'm wrong about this :-)

What I found to be interesting it that on the back of the most 
recent Atari Explorer magazine, there is an ad for PeripheralLand hard 
drives and such.  The picture they use across the top half of the ad is 
THE EXACT SAME PICTURE that they used for their ad on the back cover of 
a NeXT magazine I recently picked up. The text at the bottom is slightly 
different, as they're talking about different drives for the Atari than 
they were for the NeXT, but the similarity in the ad layoutis 
unmistakable.

Hmm, this whole NeXT business just gets curiouser and curiouser,
wouldn't you say?

and finally:

Also in the same issue of Atari Explorer, under News and New 
Products, there was a column titled "Atari/PLI Announce Agreement," 
briefly this stating that PLI will now support Atari TT and any other 
Atari SCSI-compatible computers.  It goes on to add some comment from 
 PLI and Atari execs, also some neato details on PLI's current drives :   

  - internal/external hard drives up to 2.1 gigabytes
  - 3.5" and 5.25" magneto-optical drives (up to 600 MB)
  - DAT based tape backup drives (2 GB capacity)    
  - 88 MB Removable drives        
  - CD-ROM readers

   This is good news for anyone interested in high-power and brandnew 
storage technology, also it mentions that PLI may consider porting 
itsinter-platform translation software to Atari, allowing "transparent 
filesharing" between all the platforms it supports.

Z*Net had some more info:

****************************************************************


Here's an excerpt from Z*Net Online Magazine #9214 on the new Atari 
machines.  Keep in mind that this is speculative, but reasonably 
accurate.  Read the issue for more info.


 *  The new machine is the first of another series of Atari Computers 
    that remain compatible with TOS.

 *  The new machine will be in a 1040 style case for "reasons which 
    will become obvious and very satisfying to all."

 *  The new machine will use a 68030 CPU.

 *  The new machine will very likely run a standard Super VGA monitor, 
    with colors, palette, and resolution similar to or exceeding the 
    Super VGA standards.

 *  The new machine will have industry standard ports, including SCSI 
    and others.

 *  The new machine will not have VME slots, but the VME slot has not 
    been abandoned in Atari's plans.  The 1040 case dictates no slot in 
    this particular machine.

 *  The new machine will have a multi-tasking TOS.

 *  It is likely that memory configurations of well over 4 meg will be 
    possible in the machine.

 *  The digital sound will be BETTER than that offered by the current 
    "e" and TT series of computers.  As these machines offer 8-bit 
    digital sound, look for 16 bit or more.  The current DMA sound will 
     still be supported in the new machine as well.

 *  The use of the Motorola DSP sound chip WOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED by 
    Bob Brodie.  However, he made no effort to refute the recurring 
    rumor, which originated with announcements from Motorola itself 
    (reported in Z*Net in late 1991).  The "fact" of the new line of 
    Atari computers using the DSP was in each of the unofficial stories 
    about the machine shown privately by Atari at CeBIT earlier in March 
    '92.
    The DSP is used in the NeXT computers now to provide outstanding 
    sound digitizing power.

ATARI finally revealed one of their bloodthirsty systemes at CeBIT:-

Falcon STe+ '30
===============

*MC68030 in a scream dive at 32Mhz, FPU optional
*MC56001 digital sig processor (DSP), stereo in/out
*Graphics- 640 x 480 65K simultaneous colors, video capture/overlay
*LAN/serial/parallel/quad joystick ports
*SCSI hard drive
*1.44 Mbyte 3.5" floppy
*16 Mbytes memory option
*Multitasking OS
*Price- around $1200!!!!     

Coming up soon is the Falcon '040 with VME bus
and the $200 Jaguar MAN (MAC-AMIGA-NINTENDO) eater.  

Hey, welcome to the jungle...

=================================================================
Anyone been to CEBIT and saw this????  SH*T and all Commo gives us 
is the A600/HD toy!??

*****************************************************************


Our own Wizzcat/DF added som HOT rumors recently:

*****************************************************************


 
Hmm, this might be Old news, but here we go anyway...

The Falcon/030 (the lower end version, anyway) will feature a M68030 
clocked at 16MHz (a bit disappointing, but probably necessary to keep 
price down. Also, since it is the 16MHz version, it seems likely that it 
will be the full version, not the LC (oris it EC?) version without the 
MMU).

Furthermore, the Falcon/030 will feature a 56001 DSP, equipped with as 
much as 32KB memory (this sounds a bit too much; the DSP of the NeXT has 
8KB, which should be more than enough). The DSP can DMA to main memory 
at a transferrate of 2MB/s. The DSP features 10 16 bit channels; 5 in, 5 
out. These can be accessed through a serial port (? Must be a rather 
fast one...), a 25pin DB plug, at the back of the computer. The 
Falcon/030 does not come with D/A or A/D converters fitted as standard. 
These     will be available at relatively low prices (14$ for the D/A,
100 dollar for the A/D?).

The Falcon/030 will have a great number of video modes, with 7 base 
modes. The highest mode will support 65536 colours.
Whether this is 16 bitplanes interleaved or 1 pixel/1 word, is unknown. 
All modes will be available with interlace and overscan. It also 
supports hardware scrolling in all directions.
The lower end Falcon will be delivered with a RF modulator.

The Falcon/030 also features a new custom chip, called Rascal.
The function of this chip is yet unknown, but it has connections to 8 
bit sound, so it seems likely that it has something to do with sound.

Price? Around 6000 NOK for developers = 950 dollars?

Take this for exactly what it is; rumours. Maybe I heard wrong...


****************************************************************


Well, based on the above and other rumors I've picked up during the 
last few months this is what I think/hope we will get:

A 16Mhz/030 with 16 SIM slots (giving 16 or 64 megabytes of RAM when 
filled up). A Motorola DSP used only for sound, using it for graphics 
would have been neat but also probably too expensive for the low end 
Falcon. Graphics will be good. I'd say we get the STE and TT resolutions 
(for compatibility) and one or more (perhaps even configurable ?) modes 
with more colors/bigger resolution. 16bit graphics with no palette is 
most likely what we'll get, but it's not that bad is it? :-) Since there 
will be SCSI equipment released for it, Atari would be silly not to 
include a SCSI port wouldn't they? And since there is supposed to be 
room for a harddrive inside the box I'd say we get and IDE 
interface inside. The best of both worlds. (SCSI2 isn't in this price 
area so I won't mention it). There'll be MIDI ports, printer ports, 
modem ports, DSP ports and a NEW (I hope) expansion port. Something like 
 the one on the STBook. The VMEBus won't be there, there's simply not 
room for everything in it, and VME equipment would be more expensive 
than the Falcon anyway :-) The drive has to be a 1.44 drive, Atari 
simply couldn't be silly enough to use a 720K drive. I'd say 2.88 drives 
will be available as upgrades. There must be a RF modulator built in 
if it's going to be a serious competitor to the A600 (which is the only 
thing CBM seems to be releasing into the  home  market..)

All in all there is really only one thing we can do: WAIT AND SEE!!!
 
If nothing happens it should be shown to the public at the Atari-Messe 
in DÅsseldorf in August and be available in large quantities right after 
that. So far there's only a couple of hundred machines being produced 
for developers and the entire Atari world is fighting to get these 
machines..

I'd say Atari's future looks better than we could have imagined just a 
couple of months ago. Atari sure knows how to surprise it's users!

Come on guys, get yourself a Falcon and kick some ass!
