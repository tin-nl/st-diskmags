
                          ‰THE CHARTS
 



You  might have noticed that there hasn't been any chart  program 
included in the last few issues of MAGGIE .

Perhaps you haven't missed all the rankings (especially when  you 
haven't been mentioned in them),  but we think they are important 
for various reasons:

- they  create  something like a motivation  for  the groups
- they were done in an objective way
- and finally because they were presented in a quite nice style


If  there will be enough people voting,  NeXT will continue  with 
the charts from the next issue on. SO COME ON!


 You can use the following to print and to fill in... just save!
