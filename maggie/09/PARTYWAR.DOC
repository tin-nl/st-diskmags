 
              ‰ATTENTION ALL YOU DEAR MAGGIE READERS!
 

At  the moment,  there is an invitation sheet flying around  stating 
that  " DELTAFORCE  and IMAGINA " are holding a party this  summer  in 
Norway.

We have to say,  that this party is ‰NOT  a Delta Force party,  and it 
is definately ‰NOT  any kind of I.C.C. #3. 

Delta  Force  clearly  states that we have NOTHING to  do  with  the 
organisation of this meeting, so don't blame us if the party doesn't 
suit your standards.

In our opinion,  those guys from Imagina are just using our name  to 
attract more people to come to this event.

Or,  maybe  another possibility would be that there's another  group 
calling themselves "DELTAFORCE". If it's that way, this group should 
fuck off, there can be only one.

Anyway,  none  of  us will attend the party.. 
At least not DF/de, DF/se, DF/uk. If DF/no will be there isn't sure.

If  there will be another real  I.C.C.  #3 (and not a fake  one  like 
this),  isn't  sure.  Seeing  what  all the trouble  makers  did  at 
MegaLeif,  makes us think that there will never be one.  Or just for 
elite  groups we know personally (who can behave even with booze  in 
their blood, hi An Cool). Another fact is that we just want to party 
and not organize anything. 

That's all,

      New Mode and Slime of Delta Force (arrogant as always)
