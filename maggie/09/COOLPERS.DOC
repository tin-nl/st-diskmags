After all the heaps of articles concerning "lamers", "losers" and 
other creeps, let me tell you what a "cool" person (in the  scene ) 
is supposed to be like... 
By  the  way,  this article is very much inspired  by  a  certain 
scrolltext  I've  recently read and which made me  think  for  at 
least two seconds. (It was a good scroller, indeed!)

A cool person:
 
- dresses up with very expensive clothes 
- loves porno demos (and sometimes produces them)
- goes to disco five times a week
- smokes at least two packs a day
- gets pissed every day
- has  no job since he thinks he's far too intelligent  for  any 
  kind of work
- has  at least  three steady girl friends
- thinks  he's the best in everything and all  other  people  are 
  lamers
- speaks in a vulgar way about women ( "Oh god,  that bitch was  a 
  right good shag..."  quote... errrrmmm)
 - needs drugs to improve his way of thinking
- thinks violence is something to be proud of
- has a fast car to express himself
- wears rings, earrings and various other forms of decoration
- seldom shaves
- is invited to five parties every weekend 
- deals with pirated software
- wears a leather hat and hammer pants...  (sorry,  just  kidding 
  Ben)
- has his private loudspeaker to dance on
- knows 99% of all people in his local disco
- had his first sexual intercourse at the age of 8
- gives a damn about all traffic rules
- talks in a very intellectual way (" Yo bassheads..." ).

Enough hatred now, that's my  point of view... 
 

Really impressive to be called a "cool" person, isn't it? If five 
 of the above mentioned points are true for you,  congratulations, 
you are one of those mega-cool scene people.

I  could list at least five people here that I would call  "cool" 
in this certain way,  but I'm really too ashamed to tell you  the 
names of these godfathers...

Ah,  just  one  name:  Powerman  !  You seem to be a  rather  cool 
person,  that's  why we all love you!  Oh our god,  we kneel  for 
you!
