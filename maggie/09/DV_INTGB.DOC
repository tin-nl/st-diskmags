
          ‰Interview with Headcoder of Digital Vision:
 

MAGGIE:   "Hi  Henrik!  Tell us more about you  (your  name,  age, 
         hobbies, etc.)"

HEADCODER: 
 "I ?"

MAGGIE : "You."

HEADCODER:
 My name is Schroeder,  Henrik Schroeder and I have the licence to 
drive,  the driving-licence.  Yeah allright, a few months ago I'd 
taken the procedure of getting hold of that dammed  paper.  Three 
gorgous satans who behaved like horrifying zombies from the crypt 
called   themselves  "driving-teacher"  and   "driving-examiner" 
weren't very motivating while my 3rd and last attempt to solve the 
practical driving-test.  Such devilish drives fullfilled of  hate 
are very nerve-consuming and make it a nearly impossible task  to 
regenerate in adequate time. About my age I bet for understanding 
for  the impossibility of figuring it out exactly 'cause  due  to 
the hard circumstances I aged dead fast,  so fast I otherwise age 
in decades.  My hobbies include for example kickboxing.
not  yet very good at all,  but I'm learning very eagerly from  a 
street-kickfighter  who  teaches in his spare  time.  This  sport 
has  a  more  gracile  "art-appeal"  than  the  stereotype  image 
implicates.  Try  for Yourself.  Apart from that my hobby  is  to 
think.

MAGGIE:  "To think? 'Bout what?"

HEADCODER:  "Nuffing, only to think."
   

MAGGIE:    "Our readers are surely interested how long you've been 
working with computers and on which systems you've worked in  all 
your long career"  


HEADCODER:   "Except  the rubber-roller-barrel called C-64 I  take 
only  computers from the Compuer-Iococca Jack Tramiel in my  bag. 
That  I'd  sweared  after his  glorious  doings  after  capturing 
Atari.  Before  that in prehistoric time I got hold of  an  Atari 
400er,  which  attracted with a cute,  swift plastic-keyboard  my 
attention  and sucked up many many hard earned deutsch marks  out 
of  my wallet.  Enlighted from the sheer power opened to  me,  in 
that  time only relatively comparable to a power plant,  I  began 
to  dive  in the huge amount of new possibilities and  worked  in 
several  areas.  Concrete  results I don't want to  say  at  this 
place,  since its cold coffee and only interests people who  want 
to know everything of this dammed universe-bubble we live in.
'Cause (Warner)Atari more and more turned into the role of  Cliff 
Barnes  who was once more kicked out of his pans from  JR  (which 
 task  were taken by Tramiel) I'd to realize the macabre  massacre 
that  took  place  in the  market.  Tramiel  seemed  like  Freddy 
Krueger  who  grabbed a teenie from the street and  squeezed  his 
head into dust.  And that time it wasn't a dream...  Oh boy, that 
was uncool...
The  C-64 began to dominate the scene,  and I  personally  didn't 
were very amuesed about that.  But luckily the huge potential  of 
the 400er more than compensated the lesser  influence.  E.g.  the 
256  colours are smarter than the 512 from the ST (How  about  16 
really true greytones?).  Since I can't lie,  I must admit that I 
had  also  a Hanimex-console of the first  generation.  Not  much 
more  than  pong+co,  but its very likely that it  becomes  again 
very  popular  if you keep in mind the recent boost of  such  old 
fashioned kindergarten-machines of Sega, Nintendo and co.


MAGGIE:   "We've heard rumours that you've been called THE ANIMAL . 
Why that and where's that name coming from?"


HEADCODER:   "Mmmmh...  obviously you know everything bout my very 
own biography... thats true. Some people in fact use this word as 
a  synonym  for  me.  The origin comes  from  several very 
disadvantagous occurances which happened me. Especially bad-
luck  cummulations  of especially bad-luck things  at  a  private 
meeting  provoked  some  negative  assoziation-phantasms.   To  be 
precise, at the meeting arose a little emotional escalation.  
 

MAGGIE:  "Huh?"

HEADCODER:   "Able to keep your mouth closed on this subject  till 
you die?"

MAGGIE:  "Thereafter too, chap."


HEADCODER:   " On that meeting late in the night somebody  swapped 
the  plate  of the house-dog and my very own  plate.  Due  to  my 
strict  self-diszipline  I didn't wanted to instabilize  my  good 
connection  to the host and tried to ignore the bad  taste.  Some 
brain-damaged  people  began  to make  dirty  jokes  about  that. 
Everybody saw: Thats an Animal.


MAGGIE:   "How did you get to the state of being demo coder?"


HEADCODER:  "I had a dream. And there was Abraham. And he was heat-
going. He said: The archangel would appreciate that..."
Stop joking.  Demo-coding represents only one aspect of my doings 
and  is strongly depended on raw material in shape  of  grx,  fx, 
musix,  datastructures  and  so  on.  Its a holy duty  to  me  to 
transform  the  material,  to breed it,  to push it  up  into  an 
 sophisticated  area,  e.g.  demos;  to say it clear:  the  animal 
within  me  awakes  and moans for the  duty.  The  former  sound-
releases  of Digital Vision for example has had  the  Sound-force 
tunes  as raw material,  which were styled up for ears  and  eyes 
together.  For the botanic maniacs you can call it a symbiose  of 
optical and visual effects.  


MAGGIE:   "When/how/why was your group founded?"

HEADCODER:
 One Year ago Sound Force and I ask ourselves,  how it would  look 
if  you  read something like that:  "Peter Zubizareta  and  Homer 
McAdambumper proudly presents...".  After some brutal discussions 
he  convinced  me,  that  this kind  of  presentation  isn't  the 
hottest  alternative.  Therefore we started a big  brainstorming-
excess and hoped to get hold of a really cool name this  way.  At 
the end it turned out that we had the opportunity to choose  from 
4 brill.  suggestions:  "Hawks","Battalion der Wuerde","The  best 
edv  experts  the  world has ever  seen  (TBEETWES)  or  "Digital 
Vision".  It wasn't such an easy task, to filtrate the right name 
out  of  the few,  Sound Force relied strongly on his  points  of 
view  ("the  third  one,  or the odds  become  even")  and  after 
hidehouse  assaults and re-assaults we got an compromise in  form 
of Digital Vision. 


MAGGIE:    "Your name stands for quality sample- and trackerdemos. 
What's up with any new projects?"


 
HEADCODER:   "SF eagerly produces damned hot  iron,  predestinated  
through his massive Midi-armament,  which is  for tunes the media 
equally to iron the media is a melting-pot.
There are already cassettes to get in the underground of some  of 
his ear-battering MIDI-serenades.  Also DAT and CD- renditions of 
his work shall no longer be only a vision and will arise soon...
On  the  ST there are 1-2 relaeses of some of his  stonking  best 
tunes in trackerformat coming soon in the upcoming months.


MAGGIE:  "Concerning your membership in the Alliance : how did you 
get into this group?"



HEADCODER:   "A few  months  ago  I were  consulted  by  leading 
representatives of the german alliance (if I can entitle them  in 
this way) .  I were asked to join them. That were very flattering 
indeed, I promptly got (in the mental way) my bag and teethbrush 
and followed them on the path. 


MAGGIE:   "After  you've pushed your name into people's mind  with 
all  your demos,  there's the question about joint-ventures  with 
any other famous crew..."



HEADCODER:   "Several  Guestscreens in forthcoming megademos  from 
other crews;  I'm not going to tell names,  cause I don't want to 
brag off in outragous style.... But one of it will be hotter than 
hell (maincoordinater: It's really magic).
On the other hand I arranged an agreement 'bout a strategic
alliance with TDA.  I can deny any ugly rumors about them :  They 
live  and they are fighting as only really men are able to  fight 
to finish their long,  loooong awaited STetik-demo.  Really, 
this  biting-facility  is  only  comparable  to  fighting 
pitbulls... At this place I want to wave to 'em : keep it up, guys ! 
 


MAGGIE:  "What's the best demo and the best crew in your opinion?"


HEADCODER:   "Shiny Bubbles of XANTH-developement, this was one of 
the  first  demos I saw and it really blowed the  borders  of  my 
imigination away.  This whole screen-animation was so  different 
to everything I knew from my Atari 400 before. I feeled like that 
giggling  pal  in the "Werthers Echte" candy-commercial,  who  let  his 
weird  grandpa  remember at his first contact with  that  awfully 
dreadful pills.
I  know,  it's lame code (boring 16 Pics pageflipper),  but the  optical
effect was top notch, wasn't it ? 
The best crew ?  Probably TEX,  they invented quality demo coding 
on  ST,  like  godfathers they initiated the big  bang  of  demo-
coding.  Since  their  columns in the german mag  ST-Magazin  and 
their  first polished demos many people motivated do do the  same 
(now even better).  And till now many,  many demos have as  essential 
ingredent tunes from max, the mad one.


MAGGIE:   "Most of the time you do musicdemos on ST. Tell us about 
your "normal" music taste!"



HEADCODER:  SF prefers slimy, easy fusion jazz and more soul-like
afro-pop  (dr.  alban  and  co.),  similar to the  style  of  his 
compositions if you listen carefully.  But also he's very keen  on 
housemusic  (don't missunderstand,  not like  chambermusic,  e.g. 
father plays piano,  son is feeping on the flute and grandpa uses 
the 'Stalin orgel' to prevent neighbour hazards).
I'm  more  in the swinging rock of the  rolling  fifties&sixties, 
especially  highlighting Bill haily,  the kinks and the  king  of 
course.  But  also one person I want to mention above the rest  : 
Hanne. 
 
MAGGIE:  "Hanne?"

HEADCODER:   "Hans Albers of course.  Incarnation of the hanseatic 
mentalism.  symbol  of  the port of hamburg.  He spreads
the  nordic  temperament all over the frontiers away,  due  to  his 
nationwide  popularity.  He's surrounded by a  cultic  aura,  the 
Hannes-aura I would name it. His special mark : A bardic-voice you never 
forget. Due to that, his songs are so unforgettable.
Why?

MAGGIE:  "forget it"

HEADCODER:  "Okidoki."


MAGGIE:    "You were several times recognized with your very  cool 
reactions at parties. Any comment?"


HEADCODER:  "Yes."


MAGGIE:  "Yes...Yes what?"


HEADCODER:  "...grmpf..."


MAGGIE:  "What? Is that cool?"


HEADCODER:   "I'm thinking 'bout that...  I'm a bit oversensitive, 
and  try  to  overcompensate  it.  Due to that  I  must  hide  my 
personality
to  hide  my fragile core and so I have to hang  out  a  wall.  A 
mental  wall as a natural protection of my human feelings in  the 
background.   Perhaps  an  escape,   an  escape  from  the  moody 
imagination of fear. The fear for the overflash.
Since  human  beings  have faults and do  mistakes,  and  I  hate 
mistakes. And this conflict caused forces, creates pressure...


MAGGIE:  "Okay. What's the rule of the big numbers?"


HEADCODER:   "Numbers  are  growing if You count  them  up.  Easy. 
Cause  its so easy its a lot of easier to get facts out  of  that 
circumstances.  E.G If 3 persons of 10 swear,  they saw yesterday 
a  real terminator at work ,  and the rest claim,  that  were  an 
unreal  eliminator  at  work,  You can  less  exact  justify  the 
proportion  rate of the 2 partys than if You take 100 people  and 
35 tells the first story and 75 the second."



MAGGIE:   "Now for something political. How's your relation to the 
East-German secret service (StaSi).  We've heard rumours that you 
had something to do with them.  Like being an agent or  something 
like this."

HEADCODER:   "I  don't know which good orientated circles  or  bad 
orientated triangles such speculative rumors growed.  But if that 
rumors    have   something   in   common   with    the    'Stasi-
swamp' (Stasi=little brother of KGB of former little brother (GDR) 
of USSR), then its the form of creating such rumors. 
Defams of such an evil calibre.  With no,  but absolutely nuffing 
no truth appeal,  aren't only so wrong,  they seem to seeded  out  
by someone, who don't have the right to breath anymore. 
They seem to spread  only for  the reason of  defeating a  whole~
heartly  liberal  coder.  Now I  know,  how  Olli North must have
suffered on accusation day." 
 

MAGGI:  "Sure?"

HEADCODER:    "To  erase  last  reservations.  And  to  deny  such 
reproaches, that earthquked my spiritual fundament,
in an adequate way,  I'm ready to give my word of honor, I repaet 
MY WORD of HONOR that my personal history not were infiltrated by
Cherny  (Stasi agent) nor by OIBE's (officer in special service).
Should  the Gauck-office (ministry for Stasi elimination  out  of 
society) proof otherwise,  I'm going to chose suicid and will try 
to do Harakiri."


MAGGIE:  "What's your hardware equipment?"

 
HEADCODER:   "The pulsating heart of the entire equipent  scattered 
throughout the room is the 260ST,  upgraded early to 1mb and  it 
has  one  really  fat fault,  which mutate  it (sometimes) into  a 
ridiculous moloch of crash-production. Quite nasty are the 
sporadically  phases  in which a mighty loose  connection  causes 
system-crashs  due  to memory-blackout  just  because  seismolgic 
inconsiderable little bumpings occur while mousing around.
Well,  at  least  that sort of niggles can be used  to  reach  an 
imaginative  identification with the machine.  For  illustrations 
purposes I mention the nickname of the A-10 Tank killer,  who  is 
known by his pilots as "warthog".
Furthermore  the old 400er is still in use,  and the rest of  the 
hardware includes the usual range of items,  perhaps apart from a 
milk-stool which opens the opportunity to sit, when the printer (NL 
10) is taken aside.
Sound force sits, according to his speech, in a koog (here we say 
this  to dried areas surrounded by dykes) filled of many  various 
midi-machines.  A  1040ST  plays the role of  gluing  everything 
together."


MAGGIE:  "What kind of developing software are you using?"


HEADCODER:  "Every game/demo-coding related activity relies on the 
shoulders of the GFA-Ass., perhaps the performance isn't nowadadys very 
up to date,  better ones are just around the corner, but this one 
obviously seems to have AC (addiction-code),  cause I didn't  have 
red the writings on the wall and changed to a better ass.  Or perhaps 
the real reason lies in the very own incompatible TOKEN-format of 
the sources,  who know?  On the other hand,  Turbo/Pure C is used 
for alternate applications, and of course gfa basic for internal 
utility-routs.  Sound-Force works in the tracker-areas only  with 
noisetracker 1.5 and keeps the midi-sector with the ususal  midi-
programs "burning".
 


MAGGIE:   "Will Digital Vision organize a party?  If so, when will 
it take place?"


HEADCODER:   "I don't know when, I don't know where (likely not in 
the McDonalds-party-bus),  but one thing is for sure: On Digital-
Vision you can count on.
 

MAGGIE:  "Thanks a lot for this interview!"
