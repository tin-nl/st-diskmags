 All the stars talk to PENTHOUSE ,  and naturally we listen and learn. 
Here,  we present the collected wit and wisdom of the great and  the 
good from 1991.  


One thing I remember is that I took all me clothes off expect for me 
Docs (Marten boots)...  When I fell out with her,  she told all  her 
mates  that I didn't stick me dick up her and that I'd stuck  it  in 
her belly button.

Before I did Bond,  I was on tour in a play once,  and one night  in 
Coventry,  outside  the  theatre,  there was a man hitting  a  woman 
across the road. I ran over to pull him off and then she hit me.

Normally  you  can't go back to the hotel 'cos it's miles  away  and 
you're sharing with the drummer anyway. So it's on the dressing room 
floor,  a  dark alley or the back of the transit on top of  all  the 
gear.

If  you're  going to go to bed with a woman,  Catherine  Deneuve  is 
hardly  hard to take.  She's only one of the world's most  beautiful 
women. Who wouldn't want to do to bed with her?

I  do  not  look after my body for the sake of  my  female  fans  or 
anybody else. I won't spend an hour in the gym for a girl.

Loads  of females constantly walk up to me,  and come straight  out, 
and  say things like,  'I want to go to bed with you.' I  find  that 
very  flattering - I'm never offended by a female who wants to  jump 
into bed with me.

My Tommy Cooper impersonations tend to drive co-actors mad, but it's 
better than breaking furniture and getting drunk.

It  takes a lot for me to reach a point where I am going to  take  a 
man inside me.

I don't see why I should spend my time f--ing around with  something 
I don't believe in.

Getting a guy is easy.  They're even shyer than we are.  But hanging 
on to one is something else!  If he has a short attention span,  and 
is interested in only one thing - and most men are - forget it!

Believe  you me,  we're into the sack every chance we get.  We  just 
can't  get enough of each other - and that's great.  Having  sex  is 
number one thing on our list of Doing Things Together.

I've  actually done a propenetration poem in the new  collection.  I 
felt  somebody had to do with all the AIDS thing - but  I'm  looking 
for male virgins now as a safe alternative.

I  can't think of a better existence than when you're  a  baby.  You

I preferred flirting to dating. I went with women, yes... but mostly 
sluts.  I was picking up sluts.  I got used to it.  You can talk  to 
sluts.
