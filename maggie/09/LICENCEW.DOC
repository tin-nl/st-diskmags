In the eighteen months or so, since I started to write for MAGGIE, 
I   have  come  across  some  rather  large  heaps   of   steaming 
pulchitrude,  none of which, I really wish to mention by name, all 
of which I have chosen to trash from my memory, once reviewed, but 
whilst  in  a particularly black and vicious mood,  here are  some 
more,  which  I  am choosing to dispose of in one single  article, 
rather than a series of 'game' reviews....

Once upon a disk,  came CHASE HQ 2, the oh-so-worthy sequel to the 
game that brought ZX-Spectrum type racing thrills to the ST...

CHASE II features the two 'guys' with 1970's haircuts and a
dubious "Buddy-Buddy" style 'Relationship' in a turbonutter police 
bastard car, with a mission to find a kidnapped girl, this goes on 
for several levels,  as they keep on getting the wrong girl, there 
are  several  kidnap attempts under way,  and in their efforts  to 
find  the  'Mr  Big' of the story,  all the  other  little  kidnap 
attempts are ruined by heavy-handedness..  

The game is a racer/shooter, with the player car having a gun, and 
the criminal's car having about 15inches of armour plate...  After 
it has absorbed 360 armour piercing rockets, the enemy car judders
to a halt,  amazingly,  the occupants are not turned into a cinder 
by the weight of artillery utilised against its hindquarters, then 
it  is  time  to  find  out  which  person  you  have   wrongfully 
arrested...

 This  goes  on for about five levels,  the last level  features  a 
lorry  which turns into a helicopter gunship flying  backwards  at 
200  mph  and zero feet altitude,  and it can also absorb  a  near 
infinite  amount  of punishment....  The best bit of this game  is 
shooting the innocent bystander vehicles that protectively cluster 
around  the  criminal  of  the day,  you are trying  to  shoot  to  
bits...

The  end sequence has you rescuing the girl you were  looking  for 
from  a warehouse which stores time-bombs,  failure to rescue  her 
results  in  several large and soggy explosions  which  expand  to 
their  fullest  extent,  and then go into a static  collection  of 
pixels,  destroying the warehouse...  The end message is a load of 
invertebrates testicles, and seems to be some form of verbiage you 
would get from the careers teacher at school...

Next up,  is ROBOCOP 2, this game was a best seller for months and 
months, and remained in the software charts for about a year, thus 
providing  proof  that stupidity is  particularly  gravity-defying 
when  it  comes  to good taste in software...  (How  else  do  you 
explain the 'Turtles' as No.1 last Xmas???)

There are three things to remember about ROBOCOP 2:-

1. You have a gun..

2. All the baddies have guns too....

3. It is impossible to jump, and shoot holes in the ceiling at the 
same  time..  Indeed it is not too easy to get 'Robo' to jump when 
you want him to..

4.  Every time you die,  you go back to the start..  (Oh,  is that 
four memorable things then...)

That is about as interesting as it gets folks...

 
PREDATOR  2 is a testament to the programmers art,  the programmer 
concerned having had the frontal lobes of his brain disconnected.. 
PREDATOR  2,  is an OP WOLF shooting gallery game,  bang bang bang 
bang,  yawn  yawn yawn yawn...  For sheer unadulterated stuck-in-a 
bus-shelter-for-three-hours-on-a-wet-day tedium levels,  try it on 
infinite lives!!! Guaranteed screaming mega-braindeath in under an 
hour...

TOTAL RECALL (so far,  no sequel, but the game style has been seen 
six  billion or so times before..) The lantern-jawed  hero  sprite 
runs around a two-dimensioned landscape, then people appear out of 
doors,  usually in numbers of about six at a time,  or so, merging 
into an indistinct whole which the NOT QUITE ARNOLD S.  Sprite has 
to punch the living daylights of..  He can run away,  but is faced 
with  the  unedifying task of having twenty  or  thirty  identical 
enemies chasing him, packed very close together..

I did not feel up to looking at the rest of the game,  as a whole, 
it  was nearly exciting as a game of golf followed by a  visit  to 
the stomach pump room of a large hospital..

 A Move away from the endless platform procrastinations????? 

These  may only be straws in the wind (swallows in summer,  stitch 
in  nine,  etc..) but there seem to be signs that certain softco's 
are  realising  that  the fat money-cow  formula  platform  games, 
providing endless revenue from the public's limited perception  of 
a  computer  game,  are no longer going to be such a soft or  easy 
option in the future..  Two examples are HUDSON HAWK, a licence of 
the  Bruce  Willis  mega-flop,   which  Ocean  must  have  dreaded 
handling,  when the film's lack of success came home..  Also,  the 
not-yet released ROBOCOP III (the movie)..

HUDSON HAWK only had a tenuous link with the film,  the developers 
on  this occasion turned this licence into a halfway-decent  game, 
albeit another platform game,  but not a clone of the last twenty-
 odd  releases  thrown  together on  OCEAN  world  domination  HQ's 
development kit..

ROBOCOP  III,  is  altogether  more radical,  in that it uses  the 
polished 3-D polysolids of the 'DIDdy-men' to produce a game that, 
at least looks the part, of something new and exciting on the ST.. 
The gameplay manages to retain the original licenceware system  of 
several  small  interlinked games,  and there is yet to be a  long 
term  appraisal  of how well the thing actually  holds  together.. 
Another ELITE???  we shall see....

SHOCK  NEWS:-  Domark and U.S.  Gold to forgo coin-op  conversions 
that  are  technically insubstantial,  and offer  fifteen  seconds 
lasting interest???????

 Well maybe only a few straws in the wind then.....
