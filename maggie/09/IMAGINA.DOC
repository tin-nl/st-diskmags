 (Or it could be 'X-plosion' ??)

"So  there  he was,  right,  wingeing on about there being no  STE 
demos,  and  nuffink  happening with the machine,   right ..  So you 
wanna know what IMAGINA did?!!?"

"Go on Ron, do tell.."

"They  went  and  released,  not one,  but  two  demos for the  STE, 
didn't  they...  I'll tell you now,  that'll shut him up for a few 
days at least!"

"Er, yeah Ron.."

As  you can see,  you may have read already the latest  'STE-Bitz' 
which has a 1991 retrospective groan over the lack of new material 
for the STE, and here we are again, with a new demo for the STE!!

Well  you may also recall,  that 'Bitz' looked to the future  with 
hope,  as  there  are  enough STE's to form a market in  it's  own 
right, and even if established coders are reluctant to take on the 
new  (Two  year old..) machine,  it now seems that plenty  of  new 
coders wish to grab their share of the fame and kudos of the TEX's 
TCB's  and  TLB's  of  this  world,  so it  is,  with  IMAGINA,  a 
previously  unheard-of Norwegian group,  who have released two new 
STE-only demos onto an unsuspecting world..

First of all, we have the X-PLOITATION Demo, a multi-screen effort 
for the STE, what do you get for your disk??

The disk loads and starts off with a cartoony-logo loading screen, 
with  a graffiti artist admiring his work,  the graffiti 'Imagina' 
logo..

 The  main menu loads,  this having the 'X-ploitation' logo on top, 
and a text displayer which scrolls vertically,  in and out to tell 
you what is going on, this screen reappears after each demoscreen, 
the demo is left to run,  and is not screen selectable.. The upper 
logo has a rather nice sunburst effect..

1. Vectorballs, those 3-D sprites that join together to make funny 
shapes,  are back again,  on a plain black background,  but with a 
MOD playing..

2.  Hyper-Fractals,  real-time  Mandlebrot  generation on the STE, 
(With  the  MOD  playing,  all demos have the  same  tune  playing 
continuously, no skimping on the sonix dept here..) These fractals 
are  all very nice,  but is it not time to do something else  with 
them??

3. Various graphix, more cartoony stuff..

4.  More vector balls,  over a logo, contained within a concentric 
'Dr Who' type tunnel..

5. More of those fast real-time generated Mandlebrots..

6.  We  couldn't have a demo without one of these,   a sine-scroll 
text, in this case over the 'Imagina' logo..

7.  This  screen  is hard to describe,  it is something like three 
overlapping sinuous scrolly bands entwining with each other, going 
vertically up the screen..

9.  Credits  and Greets screen,  pagefull of text over a starfield 
(Don't get many demos  without  one of those..)
Amongst  other  things,   we  find  out  that  the  coding  is  by 
Coincidence,  graphix  by  Mistake  and D-Jam,  the module  is  by 
Lieutenant Earwax...

10.  Endscreen,  line-vector graphix,  of a pentagram,  and a 'THE 
 END' logo respectively..

Also passed to me was the 'Imagina Christmas Demo'

This  is  a  small demo,  consisting a a brief  Santa-laden  intro 
sequence,  Xmassy  MOD,  and  has a slideshow of several Christmas 
scenes,  of  the  sort  that  you presumably  get  on  traditional 
Norwegian  Xmas cards..  These are done very tastefully in sixteen 
shades of grey, as befits the 4096 colour pallette..

There  is also a scroller in the lower border,  which reveals  the 
whole thing was done in three hours...  A small, but nicely-formed 
demo..

So, what about the ratings:- (combined for both demos..)

 Graphix:-   79% A good deal of potential but a lot of  screens  did 
not  have a lot in the way of graphix,  but what was done was well 
presented,  the  high spot being the 16 grey-shade screens in  the 
Xmas demo..

 Sonix:-  83% Imagina seem to have some rather good musicians  here, 
some tasty MOD's on both demos, or a tasty MOD for each demo, like 
the graphix, I would have liked more..

( You  may be interested to know that you can hear  something  like 
TWO separate two-channel tunes - If you have uneven stereo  output 
on  your  monitor like I do..  A bit of lead swopping between  the 
stereo  ports on your STE is the way to get this  effect..  Spooky 
eh??)
 
 Gee  Whiz:-  67% That strange term that covers originality,  coding 
proficiency,  and other such stuff.. There is little here that has 
not  been  done already on the STFM,  but it is nice to get a  MOD 
playing  throughout,  I  presume  that restrictions  on  CPU  time 
prevented more ambitious things happening on this occasion..

 Overall:-    78%  This clearly belongs to the 'First time' school  of 
demos,  but  that  is nothing to be ashamed of..  Imagina have the 
graphix  presentation and music to pull off a really good demo  in 
the future, some original ideas (That ol' chesnut again..) and , I 
suppose,  More  of everything would be a good idea..
