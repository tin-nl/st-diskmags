 Some philosophical ramblings on the random side.....

 BY A.J.Booker (No relation to the literature prize...)
 
 WITH occasional editorial interference by Chris H.

 Brief intro,  Andy is yet another guest writer,  who you will see 
more of, in the future, etc etc..

Onto the story.....

Once  upon  a time,  there was the world's greatest media  expert, 
this  is  his  story,  and  that of his  hardly  less  illustrious 
successor who made the Computer 'Industry' what it is today....

Nathan Brown was born of humble parents in early 1900's  Illinois, 
little is known of his early life, but he first came to prominence 
as  a young advertising genius,  working for FORD AUTOMOBILES,  in 
his own words...

"My  work at Ford was pioneering in the literal sense.  I saw  our 
customers buying our cars,  and I saw our workforce building those 
cars.  To  substain  growth  and regulate supply I  advised  Henry 
(Ford)  to offer his Model T in 'Any colour you like,  as long  as 
it's black..'"

"Those  people  continued to buy the Model T because  they  didn't 
think  there  would  be an alternative,  so we foxed 'em  when  we 
brought  out  the the car in white,  seven years later..  They all 
lokked  stupid  with the black car,  parked next to a shining  new 
white car...  Why, regular fellas would take out a second mortgage 
to  buy a white car,  trading in the black model they had only got 
weeks  earlier  at a damn low trade-in price ..  Same  with  other 
 colours, say it wasn't available, then hit 'em with the old sucker 
punch!"

In  1940,  with  war  looming,  Brown made a critical move to  the 
Sherman  Tank  plant,  which  was just coming into  production  in 
Wyoming... He recounted from his 1950's memoirs 'Death AND Taxes'.

"The army told us to produce 10,000 tanks with a 200 mile range, I 
told them it could not be done, so instead, we made 500 tanks with 
2000  gallon  fuel  trailers  dragged  behind  them..  These  were 
armoured,  but most of the early prototypes did not last for long, 
once the trailers were gone, the main vehicle was a sitting duck."

"So  the Pentagon threw money at us,  we jawed a bit,  and then we 
made  space  inside  the hull of the tank for  the  fuel,  at  the 
expense  of  the crew,  but their place was largely taken  by  the 
automatic  controls developed by us,  some years earlier,  and the 
fuel fitted inside perfectly, as we originally designed it to.."

"That's Dollarscience,  if the public's paying a buck for it, make 
them pay a buck and a quarter!"

After  the  war,  Brown found the time to marry Ruby Glossler,  an 
expert,  in  her  own field of advanced electronics and  prototype 
computers.  Brown, using his wife's knowledge gained a job with an 
embryonic  firm called Techpoint,  he fondly recalled those  early 
days....

"Techpoint was great!!  Nobody but us understood it,  here we were 
able to develop and refine Dollarscience into a religion... We had 
one  main  product back in '52,  the Ruby Accumulator,  it was fed 
with punch cards of 1 digit numbers,  it added these up,  and gave 
the answer on a tickertape machine. The guts of the thing were two 
feet square... We then stuck it inside an 18 by 30 feet container, 
there was a water cooling system kept in the adjoining room,  with 
it's own circuitry,  which in turn was backed up by a liquid Freon 
cooling system to keep the extra hot running valves in check, none 
 of  this had anything to do with the day-to-day performance of  the 
Ruby Accumulator, of course.."

"There  were  ten  or twenty technicians  in  attendance  at  each 
machine we installed, to impress the Boss of the latest outfit who 
had hired us, we would increase the power on the valves until some 
of them blew,  he would see three or four white-coated bodies rush 
to  replace  them,  these coats had stains,  brown stains all over 
them, coffee stains!! The boys really had nothing to do!!"

Brown subsequently sold the technology and philosophy of the  Ruby 
Accumulator to IBM for an undisclosed (Large) sum of money,  it is 
then  unclear  where he went from there,  some rumours put him  in 
South America, inspiring a Dollarscience based resurrection of the 
Third  Reich,  other rumours have him as lost at sea,  we are sure 
that  he  is  enjoying a comfortable  retirement  in  the  obscure 
paradise beach of his choice....

Moving  on now to the second of our two notorious  Media  experts, 
Tom  Abermule,  who  was  born in 1955,  somewhere  in  Yorkshire, 
England..  He  first  surfaced in 1975,  in the Hi-Fi division  of 
Amstrad,   supervising  new  product  development.  Abermule  took 
Amstrad's  existing  range and using their  high  integration  PCB 
technology,  he  produced a 'vertical' wall-mounted Hi-Fi  outfit, 
95% of the casing being 100% breathable atmosphere....

He then used a refinement of the basic 'Dollarscience' concept  to 
ensure that people upgraded when required to,  this unique insight 
came via an interview for Omni magazine....

"Yes it was a development in Psychomarketing,  and yes,  it was my 
idea...  You make something damn good,  and everyone wants it! You 
make it cheap enough for people to buy, then instead of pretending 
you  have  no  plans  to improve it,  you  tickle  the  public  by 
promising them the moon!!"

"These  upgrades,  when  they  do appear,  aren't that much of  an 
 improvement,  often  just the same  electronics repositioned in  a 
different box, but by that time, expectations are so pent up, that 
people  buy  it to save face anyway,  we sold millions!!  All crap 
really..."

It was soon after this interview that Abermule and Amstrad  parted 
company.

Meanwhile,   across  the  Atlantic,  IBM  had  refined  their  own 
Dollarscience  into  the  'AT'  series  of  machines  with  future 
capabilities  already built into their machines but  left  dormant 
and  unactivated  for the customers concerned.  To activate  these 
features,  an expensive call was made by an IBM engineer, who only 
had to reset a 'DIP switch within the case, instantly uprating the 
machine.. 

However,  it  was  not at IBM,  but ATARI,  where Abermule's finest 
hours  were  to come..  Abermule took the original design for  the 
Atari  ST,  integrating  the  power  supply and  disc  drive,  and 
slightly  later,  the TV modulator to produce the ST-FM series  of 
machines..   As   happened   with  Amstrad,   the  original   sold 
brilliantly,  the  eagerly awaited successor arrived a year  late, 
the  STE..  The  advanced 32-bit model,  the TT underwent  various 
specification  changes  over a long period of time before  it  was 
launched,  the  rumours  surrounding the 'downgrading' of the  STE 
specification in favour of the TT never quite went away...

Dollarscience,  in  the  hands of Abermule then became an  end  in 
itself,  rather then a useful boost to company fortunes, this most 
clearly seen with both the Transputer, and the 'Super-Console'..

The  transputer board,  was marketed without any firm and finished 
product  for  years at a time,  prototype boards came to  computer 
shows,  and went,  with interested sections of the press being fed 
with enough snippets of information to keep media interest alive.. 
This was assumed to be Abermule's own idea, but he admitted it was 
borrowed from Porsche of Germany..
 
Perhaps  the most bizarre case of 'Life coming a very poor  second 
to  Art'  was the protracted saga of the next  generation  'Super-
Console'  Billed  as a machine to take on and destroy the  up  and 
coming 16-bit Japanese consoles, the first machine, the 'Panther'. 
this reached the stage where development kits had been released to 
programmers,  when  work on the even more shadowy 'Jaguar'  Super-
Console was speeded up, and the Panther was dropped abruptly. This 
served a two-fold purpose,  as speculation grew around the Jaguar, 
as  being a 64-bit machine capable of supporting Virtual  Reality, 
and  being  emphasised  as something extremely  special,  the  now 
publicly  disclosed Panther hardware (No mean achievement  itself) 
was  given new life,  as part of the firmware for a new generation 
of enhanced STE's or STEE's... More grist to the rumour mill...

It  is not surprising that Commodore,  Atari's arch-rival in  this 
period  was totally outclassed,  and only able to offer rumours of 
an  'Enhanced Chip set' for it's Amiga range,  which never  turned 
up..  Quite  a  contrast  from the days when Commodore  had  about 
fifteen  rumours  a  week  on upgrades for  the  Commodore  64...

The  end  for Tom Abermule came under  extremely  distressing  and 
peculiar  circumstances,  a  fatal heart-attack linked to a  memo, 
which he may have misread,  thinking Atari were going to bring the 
Panther  to full production,  as opposed to merely disclosing it's 
existence,  all  attempts at rescusitation failed,  he died on the 
14th September 1991, ironically as his finest coup was unfolding..

Atari Marketing Supremo Jim Vox has this to say:-

"Without  Tom,  Atari would only be a shadow of the company it  is 
today. It is thanks to all his work in the period since 1986, that 
Atari  are  on  a winning roll.  We will owe so much  to  Tom  for 
several years yet..."

  This little lot is fictional, resemblance to any real-life person 
or  large consumer electronics manufacturer alive or dead(ish)  is 
entirely co-incidental and unintended (I hope ...) - CIH

Finally,  some  quick examples of the fine art of Dollarscience as 
applied to the computer 'Industry'

For  example,  a  crap ZX81-type text editor requires great  'self 
discipline' to use properly, there is the case of Acorn Computers, 
where the machines are expensive,  and limited by their specialist 
(educational)  marketing,  hence  have a limited software  base... 
Their  defenders  used  to look down on the rest  as  "Only  games 
machines"..

I wonder where these people are now?

Software has it's supreme example of Dollarscience with ELITE II.. 
The original was so good, that the merest rumour of a sequel lends 
it credibility, who knows, one day we may see it????

Then there is the 'New' Carebears demo????????  One day we may see 
that...

If  somebody  has a really stubborn set of fingers,  perhaps  they 
would  like  to  do a list of  Dollarscience  based  products  and 
programs for a future issue (I know I won't...)
