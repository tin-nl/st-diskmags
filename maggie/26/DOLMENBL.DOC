Jesse's hobbies:

        This week, I have been mainly playing on the internet.

Yes, Dolmenballs has finally got itself  on-line and found a veritable
treasure trove of wacky quotes on a place known as IRC!

If you didn't know, IRC stands  for  'I  Rite  Crap' and it is full of
people for whom spelling and grammar  are alien and rather frightening
concepts.

Multiple  conversations  go   on   simultaneously,   in  which  single
statements do not make much sense  unless  you are following the whole
thread of the debate.

Log! Log! Log!

Atari IRC gives you the opportunity to  store all the witterings in an
IRC log -  sort of home video  footage for ascii fetishists. The great
thing about this log is  that  you  can  take  lines completely out of
context and the then laugh at them with your face.

Let's give you an example...

<Åtoodeloo> Vido, we checked capy yesterday...hmm.. music sounded like
           shit..Ä

Well, you wrote it mate!

If you hadn't caught the rest of the conversation you wouldn't realise
that Toodeloo wasn't talking about the  quality of the composition. He
was in fact talking about the  quality  of  the  replay - no doubt the
resonance wasn't up to standard.

Another example.

Just exactly what are toodeloo and vido comparing?

Å<Vido> toodis: really? ... hmm ... i believe its not so big for me as
       for you
<toodeloo> Vido, evl noticed directly aswell..Ä

The more base reader may  think  that  these  two YesCrew members were
comparing  their,  erm,  'members',  with   evl  being  some  sort  of
adjudicator (the man with the tape measure).

But in fact, the previous comments clear this up:


Å<toodeloo> Vido, all tunes were played wrong..
<Vido> toodis: well that you know ... i alwas heard like that and i
       still like it :)) ... the other too :))
<toodeloo> Vido, well you must have heard them in the tracker ?
<toodeloo> Vido, its a REALLY big difference.
<Vido> toodis: really? ... hmm ... i believe its not so big for me as
       for youÄ
..etc.

Yes, they are discussing replay again.

It's so easy to stitch people up.  So lets instead shift our vision to
people who are adept at stitching themselves up.


                             Ç * * * * *Ä


A letter arrives at the DolmenBalls office.  This in itself is a cause
for some sort of celebration, and  closer  inspection of the said item
brings even more excitement. Its from  a foreign country! By the faint
eau-de-garlic we surmise it must be of Gallic origin.

Tearing it open we discover  it  is  from French hardware-gods Centek.
Their accelerators and computers  are  almost  as  legendary for their
power as they are for their  mammoth  gestation period. It was October
1996 that we first heard about the Phenix, lest we forget.

It'sgoodofCentektomakeanappearanceinacolumnthatispartly
namedafterthem!Let'sseewhattheyhavetosay...

Å"Dear Sir or Madam"Ä

The letter begins in a nicely  personal  manner. Imagine our shock and
distress when we later find out that  the same letter has been sent to
a number of our acquaintances.

Å"We have the pleasure of the  announcing  to  you that the CENTurbo II
accelerator card for the Falcon030 is finally available."
Ä
The key word here is 'finally'.  Yes,  it  has been in development for
rather a long time...

Å"This accelerator card  is  without  doubt  the  best  product for the
FALCON"Ä

..now hold on there! The best product for the Falcon? This is a pretty
bold statement. What criteria as you using to judge this:

Å"in performance, price and the  unique  customer service CENTEK has to
offer:"Ä

Here it gets interesting.  Centek  may  be  an innovative company, but
they are hardly world  renowned  for  their 'unique' customer service.
Just what does this unique customer service involve?

 Å"free updates"Ä

What, they send you the CENTurbo 3 board for free? And extra chips and
resistors to solder on your existing board? Unlikely.

 Å"lifetime warranty"Ä

A good service, but not really unique. And that's assuming your Falcon
lasts a lifetime!

 Å"phone assistance (21PM to 23PM)"Ä

Now  phone  assistance  isn't   very   unique.  But  phone  assistance
exclusively between the hours of 9PM-11PM - that's pretty unique!

 Å"delays"Ä

Well you have to  hand  it  to  the  Centek  lads for their refreshing
honesty. They promise you delays, and boy do they deliver them!


                             Ç * * * * *Ä


Back to IRC for another 'GEM':

Å<toodeloo> [SWE], i have problems with the envelopes.. dont know how
           to solve it..Ä

Well, you write the address on the  same  side as you place the stamp.
And don't forget to seal it before posting!

But sometimes the actual conversations  really  are funnier than these
out of context quotes. Especially when they involve Felice...


                             Ç * * * * *Ä


1. Felice demonstrates his masterful knowledge  of the creation of the
magazine he works for.  The  vote  compiler  for  Maggie  25, sh3, has
passed the duties over to MrPink. This has somewhat confused our hero.

Å<Felice_> mrpink: is MSG still compiling the votes ?
[MrPink] felice: no i am!
<Felice_> mrpink: has he left the scene then ?
Ä
Aha! "Person who  never  compiled  votes  in  the  first  place is not
compiling votes now, therefore he must  have quit the scene." This has
some sort of perverse  moondog-style  logic  to  it.  It's the kind of
'story' you expect to find in the UCM scene news!


                             Ç * * * * *Ä


2. Hunt the Felice. It's the new sport that it taking the world of IRC
by storm! Anyone can play!

ÅFelice_ (felice@man-074.dialup.zetnet.co.uk) has joined #atari
#atari: <Felice_> reÄ

... general chatter  continues  for  ages.  Felice's  presence finally
acknowledged ...

Å#atari: <GingerNut> felice: re
#atari: <HP48MMX> hi FeliceÄ


.... more  felice-free  waffle.  Then  the  great  man  lays  down the
gauntlet ...

Å#atari: <Felice_> gingernut: see if u can find me now on ICQ ;)
Ä
... other people's IRC  lives  continue  untroubled by this challenge.
Finally, a carefully thought out riposte emerges from the void ...

Å#atari: <GingerNut> felice: ok
Ä
... aj has a query ...

Å#atari: <AnthonyJ> felice: are you using the Atari port?
Ä
... he's bowled a googly! how will felice respond? ...

Å#atari: <Felice_> aj: no, on PC
Ä

... but our hero has all  the  answers!  But  where  is he? We have to
scroll through many, many more lines of text until...

Å#atari: <AnthonyJ> felice: well I found you :)
Ä
... Wow! Talk about the  thrill  of  the  chase! Aren't you exhausted,
reader, after all that gripping action?  But  let's leave it to Felice
to sum up the excitement...

Å#atari: <Felice_> aj: cheers
Ä

                              Ç* * * * *Ä


3. Felice predicts the downfall of Undercover Magascene...

Å<evl> mrpink, expect massive loads of angry germans, I've never seen a
german magazine writer that can spot a joke ;)
<Felice_> mrpink: mind you, I wonder  how  long ucm will actually last
.......... :)
[MrPink] felice: why, are you  thinking  of doing a little 'industrial
espionage'? ;-)
[MrPink] felice: like writing for it!
<Requiem> MrP: ;-)Ä


                              Ç* * * * *Ä


The readme files that come with  UCM  are  always good for a laugh, as
they are so packed with  witty  anecdotes, cheeky double entendres and
razor sharp satire. Not for  nothing  is moondog considered 'the Jimmy
Tarbuck of the atari generation'.

But even this great comedian can be unintentionally funny sometimes.

Å"I'm sitting in front of my humble ST to write these last lines"
Ä
Good job he wasn't sitting behind it  or  he would never have seen the
screen! Sitting under it could have  caused  a similar problem. And if
he'd been sitting on it he may well have squashed it!

Å"This evening I met an old friend..."
Ä
That's nice! The wily old dog  is being sociable and affectionate with
an old acquaintance. He knows the true meaning of friendship.

Å"...to use his Falcon"
Ä
Well, maybe we spoke too soon! Still,  at  least he has his ear to the
ground:

Å"Hum, I heard that all these people  going mad because of the delay of
this UCM."
Ä
That's right people were going  mad.  There  were parties being thrown
everywhere - 'Celebrate, UCM isn't  out  yet! Enjoy yourself while you
still can, before you are thrown into another fit of depression by the
grumpy Germans!'

Å"Erm... I  don't  understand   all  those  guys,   just  crying  about
the  delay instead of doing  something  by  themself  and this is just
lame!"
Ä
Yes complaining about things is  lame!  They should have written their
own issue of UCM! And  complaining  about  people who complain? That's
great!

Å"It seems as many people  are a bit too limited in their  brains..."
Ä
You know, I get exactly that same  feeling, every time I read an issue
of UCM! Uncanny!

Å" because  they don't  understand  that  we   have to do other  things
too, "
Ä
You actually do other things? But each issue of UCM is so well written
and meticulously researched it  must  surely  take  all your available
hours of free time!

Å"I for example, have to go to  work every day,"
Ä
What a crazy country Germany  is!  People  can't  just spend all their
time on their computers  -  they  have  to  go  out  to work! How this
differs from the UK, where the editor of Maggie just spends his day in
a sauna surrounded by topless models.  The government actually posts
himdaily deliveries of money and hard drugs.

Å" Perhaps you can imagine how  fucking  tired you're after such a hard
"week". "
Ä
I think it must  be  impossible  to  imagine  how tired moondog feels.
Unless you have spent the last 50 years of your life working in a hard
labour camp in Siberia,  you  can't  possibly  begin to understand the
difficulties our heroic UCM editor faces every single day.

Å"Then  you're  sitting  down to support the scene a little bit"
Ä
Forget the work, this is the difficult  - the sitting down 'to support
the scene'. We've tried 'lying down - to support the scene' and 'doing
handstands - to support the scene' but we didn't get much response.

Å"and all what you will get are just some dull sayings"
Ä
So you've just been sent Mod and McLaser's articles for next issue...

Å"It really doesn't  care  to  me  if  I  will  loose  some respects or
"friends" becoz of this lines,"
Ä
No, more important is the loss  of  the use of friends' Falcons because
of these lines!

Å"Ok, hard words  in the beginning, more will follow in the mag"
Ä
What, like "antidisestablishmentarianism"?

Å"perhaps some people will be pissed off... but again I DON'T CARE!"
Ä
Hey, its only the readers! Who  cares?  As  long as the writers get to
sit down in front of their humble  computers  (or in front of those of
their "old friends") thats all that matters!

Å"read this mag as would it be the last"
Ä
At least that one way to cheer  up  the readers. As they trudge grimly
through the articles they can  think  "at  least  I won't have to read
another issue of this stuff!"

Å"Because of all the  hype and  discussions   we will not give  you any
new planned release dates."
Ä
Brilliant.  Keep  everything  close  to   your  chest.  Keep  everyone
guessing. Let people seriously consider  the possibility that this may
be the last issue. That will make  them appreciate you. Don't give the
slightest hint away.

Å"Just one hint, autumn..."
Ä
Doh!
