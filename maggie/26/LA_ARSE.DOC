LYNDA LA PLANTE TALKS ABOUT THE INSPIRATION BEHIND KILLER NET

Starting on Tuesday May 5 at 10pm, Killer Net is prolific writer LYNDA
LA PLANTE's latest and, potentially,  most controversial work, delving
into the dark side of the internet explosion.

"The Killer Net story came from  three different sources," Lynda says,
"I think the first realisation came  when  I read that the Internet is
unpoliced and unmonitored, and beaming  into  very young minds. I just
found it extraordinary that today's  youth  were  able to very quickly
adapt to computer networking - and I am talking about five-year-olds -
whereas I, as an adult, was just getting my head around Word Perfect!"

€

So began a journey into  the  intriguing  world  of computer and games
technology and the  Internet.  "In  the  very  beginning,  I  was just
extremely interested and asked  many  questions.  However, when I read
that a high percentage of  the  Internet  is  used for pornography and
paedophilia, I began  to  delve  deeper.  The  Internet  had virtually
become like the dating pages of  adult  magazines, but so much faster.
You could put your  advert  on  the  Net  and  someone would answer in
minutes," she continues.

€

Lynda was shocked by a story  of  a  12-year-old American girl who had
given away her personal details  on  the  Net  and  arranged to meet a
'friend'  -  apparently  a  schoolboy  from  a  nearby  neighbourhood.
Fortunately she told her mother  who  alerted the police. The 'friend'
turned out to be a man wanted for murder in three US states.

"The horror of this situation  struck  me  very  hard indeed and I was
shocked to realise how easily a criminal  can have access to a child,"
she says, "Then my nephew invited me  to  play a computer game. With a
little help I found myself playing and I was horrified at the contents
of this game - which can be  bought  in  any computer game shop - rape
and a brutal murder.  I  started  looking  at  other  games he and his
friends were playing.  Games that  encourage  stealing cars, robbing a
store. The other frightening aspect that dawned is the fact that young
people were spending all of their free time on these games."

€
Unbeknown to Lynda, the research  process  into Killer Net had already
begun, but it was  not  until  she  stumbled  across  a  Cyber Cafe in
Ireland that the germ of an idea  was  sown. "I started talking to the
kids and watched them as  they  played  their  games and spoke live to
other Net users. I thought, what if  the wrong kid got too involved in
a game, or worse, with the wrong person."

Lynda began the painstaking research for  which she is well known. She
looked at a great number  of  games  and  was shocked at the violence,
realising that the  minds  of  the  participants  were  very quick and
devious, but more important that the sex and violence within the games
flew completely over their heads.

„"Painstakingresearch"!?€-„Ohreally!-Abouttwominutesworth-In

€

"I knew I had a great idea but I also knew I couldn't write it without
help, so I surrounded myself with all the experts I could find - I had
games experts, computer experts, students, police, every possible help
guiding me," she goes on.  "Killer  Net  could never have been written
without this help and as  we  got  deeper  and deeper in, building the
layers of the game,  the  realisation  that  Killer Net could actually
happen chilled me to the core."

"Killer Net is a very moralistic piece," concludes Lynda, "I hope the
audience will learn  from  it,  the  devastation  and  destruction the
Internet can cause,  just  how  deeply  it  can  affect  them  and how
urgently it needs to be policed."

What do you think? We'd welcome your views in our forum and we hope to
persuade Lynda La Plant to join  us  online  during the next couple of
weeks to discuss the drama and her views on the internet.
