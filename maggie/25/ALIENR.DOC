     Okay - so you went to see it.

I'll even forgive you, because I DID TOO.

But if you try and  tell  me  you  liked  it,  I'll rip your face off,
because Alien Resurrection is truly
                                   truly

shit.



Let's start with a bit of empathy..


     Just imagine you are  the  faceless  hierarchy of a multi-million
dollar company whose only aim  in  life  is  to become a multi-billion
dollar company.  When you wake up  in  the  morning and open your eyes
you don't squint in dread at the  prospect of enduring yet another day
of mundane, meaningless  drivel  that  is  life  -  instead  your mind
immediately begins to formulate  and  postulate  and consummate money-
making ideas..

     As you impatiently rub the sleep  out of your eye-lashes your eye
falls upon a passing car and  without  even  having to think about it,
you have already noted the make and year, calculated the value and are
half way to estimating the income of its owner.  Once this is complete
you allow yourself a moment  of  satisfaction from your newly acquired
knowledge that it is ('approximately') the  amount you earn in a week.
You see, hear, think, taste, breathe, Avarice..

     And so one morning, onto your lavish desk falls a proposal which,
after being slit open with one  flick  of your Gucci-ed wrist attached
to your well-manicured hand  holding  your jewel-encrusted paperknife,
has you salivating in anticipation.  Someone has done it.  The concept
that had eluded everyone  for  years.   The  'holy-grail' of the film-
industry: yes! yet another Alien film! [and here you reach the apex of
your ecstasy]  featuring  the  Return  of  Ripley!..  "yes!  Yes! YES!
YEEEEEESSSS!" you cry  in  financial  orgasm,  before  swooning into a
faint at the prospect of a  4th  instalment  of the saga with at least
treble the box-office takings.. it is,  very literally, the dream come
true.


     Seven dreamers.

Each unique, a facet  implicitly  reflected  in the different textures
and landscapes of their dreams.  No  one  image, spawned inside any of
the  seven  subconsciously   churning,   seething,   burrowing  minds,
extracted and placed in  the  glare  of  consciousness,  would ever be
considered as the product of a  human  mind let loose upon itself.  It
would  be  considered  too  horrific.    Too  darkly  malevolent,  too
facelessly  terrifying.   Occasionally  such  images,  or  sounds,  or
sensations do find their way out  into  the waking world - that moment
when you hang between  dream  and  despair  between death and reprieve
between sleep and self-awareness, tearing  at the very darkness inside
your head seeking to escape, to deny the contents of your own mind, to
block out the soundless noise  being  emitted  by some nameless terror
even at the cost of your own eardrums..


     There was a rumour, long ago,  that  Ripley would be brought back
by means of making the whole of Alien  3 a dream.  And yes that sounds
like a horribly dodgy  'Dallas'  story-line  but  believe me, it would
have been oh so much  more  preferential  to  the route they did take.
Just to be able to let the hackneyed, rushed, and irritatingly muddled
directionless hybrid that was Alien 3 quietly dissolve and slip out of
your  mind  while   settling  back  to  return  to  the  symmetrically
beautiful ending of Aliens seems, all too inviting.

     And that's because it is.  As  a  dream, such a story could never
exist in reality.  You can never go back.  The past can only ever be a
bittersweet memory and any attempt  at recapturing it, like blundering
into an intricate spider's web and  destroying exactly the beauty that
made you preserve it in the first place.

     So, yes - they successfully avoided the tempting, ideological and
therefore realistically impossible approach  [and  we  were spared the
Ripley/Hicks marriage at least,  with  'comedy'  attempts at the tough
soldier being fatherly towards Newt..],  But it meant we went into the
film with a treacherous legacy: both  the  dregs and the pinnacle.  An
alien revealed, a heroine sacrificed, a story completed?

     So the problem was then, where were  they to pick up on it?  They
could of course have begun again with  a wholly new set of characters,
a sort of Star Trek Next Generation approach, but of course that would
have meant no Ripley and, still kicking themselves for letting Michael
Fincher  kill  off  their  most  prized  financial  asset,  they  were
obviously loth to ratify what he  had  done.   Thus when art failed to
fulfil their wallets, they turned to  a more scientific approach, with
the added,  accidentally  convenient  bonus  of  that  exact  brand of
genetic-engineering being contemporary, Dolly-the-sheep flavour of the
month.  And in this  way  they  created  a  film  that,  like a clone,
doesn't really have any identity of its own, and is in fact a slave to
the whims of its maker and therefore entirely devoid of self-respect.

     Somebody, no  doubt  the  same  entity  who  was  responsible for
enabling the return of Ripley,  can  probably  also take the blame for
casting Winona Ryder as her  co-star.   Or  maybe Winona should take
the blame herself - a self-confessed fan of the Alien saga, she should
have had the  brains  to  realize  that  her  complete  lack of acting
ability (let alone talent) would hardly further the artistic merit and
complexity of  an  already  ill-fated  sequel,  and  therefore  should
instead have gracefully acknowledged her own incompetence and gone and
opened a nursery in down town L.A., where she could act like a 10 year
old everyday of the  week  and  no-one  would  take  any notice (or be
painfully subjected to her  whimpering  whinging).   As  it was, if it
hadn't already sounded, the Alien  Resurrection death-knell tolled the
moment Winona first got her hands onto a copy of the script.  However
we may allow  ourselves  a  moment  of  satisfaction  that  of all the
characters in the film,  she  couldn't  have  been  given  a role more
ironically pleasing than that of the robot.

     The first shock we get  from  Alien Resurrection, after the shock
of the  incredible  weak  script,  (from  "fuck"  to  "fork"  to  full
sentences in one scene..) is from  its clumsy attempts at humour.  Not
the subtle, human,  character-establishing,  satirical  banter between
marines in Aliens, which worked  so  well  in making us understand and
become emotionally interested in these  set  of people whose lives are
spent sleeping and waking to face  death  and thus whose brief moments
of waking safety, in order to preserve their sanity, can only be spent
relaxing and displaying their repressed human-natures.  But the humour
in Alien Resurrection has  entirely  the  opposite  effect, serving to
distance the characters from the story  in  which they are supposed to
be acting.  How can we ever be afraid  for the life of a person who is
completely aware of  the  danger  and  yet  entirely  unafraid  of the
situation they  themselves  are  in?   If  he  doesn't  experience any
horror, how the hell are we supposed  to?  None of the characters ever
comes close to Hudson's  hysterical  outburst  of  despair: "It's game
over man, game over!" which managed to  be both human and humorous and
entirely fitting for his character and the situation.

     Horror and humour can work, but  it is a subtle relationship that
can all too easily have  a  bathetic effect, neutralizing that fragile
entity: tension - the product  of  good, incisive, subtle horror.  And
so on the one hand  Alien  Resurrection  expects  us to be emotionally
shattered and outraged as Ripley  views  the  previous products of the
process that cloned her, and yet  on  the  other, the scene is rounded
off with a final quip of: "Must  be a chick thing." ensuring the whole
episode is rendered ridiculous, anything  it tried to create destroyed
and the sense we are left  with:  that  of  a film laughing at itself.
This is a sensation increased at  other  points  in the film.  We even
begin to have a quiet  suspicion  that  Sigourney Weaver herself feels
the absurdity of her own lines and role  in the film as she speaks the
inspired lines that sum up  her  last  encounter  with an Alien as: "I
died".  It all feels like a  very  bad, improbable dream.  The sort in
which you realize that the woman, who  you thought was your mother, is
actually  Tony  Blair  wearing  a   wig,  lip-stick  and  disturbingly
psychotic-smile..

     And apart from the  humour  that  makes this particular situation
seem farcical, there are the dreadful  Ripley Clones, which are simply
too crude to be believable  and  induce  musings  as to what they were
made out of rather than  feelings  of  cathartic outrage at scientists
playing god (and here is the 'theme' of  the film - just what is alien
and what is human? what is good and what is evil..?).

     This is a problem shared by  the hybrid alien, the film's central
piece - its trump card..  or  more  accurately,  its nemesis.  The new
alien form fails to be  even  remotely  scary  and instead looks quite
hilarious - a sort of cross between  a  baby,  a dog, an old hag and a
skull.  Needless to say, our  reaction  is  neither that of even faint
terror, nor that of the  crazed script writer's: "beautiful, beautiful
butterfly", and instead we resort  to  wondering  just exactly why the
thing has a  flexible  nose  and  what  it  uses  it  for, rooting for
truffles?

     As for the birth of the hybrid,  how Sigourney Weaver ever kept a
straight face during  the  procedure  will  remain  one  of  the great
mysteries of all time, as the  little queen's tinny arms wildly gyrate
and the huge dome of slime rises up like a giant, moulded jelly before
sliding off to reveal the ancient  baby  alien.. it's all far too much
and merely succeeds in making Hammer Horror look credible.

     In fact, never have  I  seen  a  horror  film  that is so totally
lacking in tension.  Its pace  is  inconsistent.  It fluctuates wildly
between the ridiculously accelerated, where  all extraneous people are
killed off [conveniently leaving the  core  set of characters plus one
'bad-guy'] by lizard-like aliens that scurry  about and cause waves of
hysterical screaming  but  remarkably  leave  the  central  characters
untouched, to the sentimentally slow,  in  which  Ripley and Ms. Rider
can sit on a bench and  have  a quiet tete-a-tete without the audience
ever fearing that they,  or  the  rest  of  the space-pirates, will be
attacked by these all too predictable aliens.

     The aliens themselves  are  never  allowed  to  intrude  into the
film's fabric and in fact feel like  they had been employed to do only
the odd cameo-role, to  show  their  familiar  heads, bare their inner
teeth, drool and so on,  but  to  think for themselves? certainly not.
The film turns the aliens into  banal stereotypes, entirely lacking in
personality.  This is diametrically  opposed  to  Alien,  in which the
single alien very much had its  own  character and dominated the film,
and also to Aliens, where the alien intelligence of these creatures is
given a hive-like structure and  hierarchy  which feels so appropriate
as  to  be  almost  axiomatic  and   yet   still  allows  them  to  be
unpredictable and terrifying.  In Alien Resurrection the aliens are on
cue.  They have their  entrances  and  exits  and  never step over the
bounds of what has been prescribed  for  them.   And as such they lack
both character and energy..  Perhaps  Ms.  Ryder was also let-loose in
an Alien suit and is  once  again  demonstrating her total devotion to
killing off any spark of  self-awareness and foreign intelligence left
in Giger's over-exposed alien.

     Over-exposure, or lack of subtlety is a chronic 90's syndrome and
can partly be blamed on computers.   Where once, creating a believably
alien creature and  letting  it  run  around  and  crawl  up walls was
constrained by the  gravitational  and  ergonomic  restrictions of the
human body inside the suit, this is  no longer the case since there is
no need to actually have the alien  in corporal form at all.  And with
a computer image the possibilities far out-weight the restrictions.

     Ridley Scott rendered Giger's Alien  truly horrific.  The closest
a film  has  ever  come  to  manifesting  the  human  mind's  internal
nightmare and tapping into the  pure  terror  which results.  And this
was achieved almost  by  accident  since  Scott  found  that  the more
exposure 6'10" Bolaji Badejo wearing  his  alien-suit was allowed, the
more the alien lost its power to terrify because people could see that
it was actually a human in  a  rubber  suit.   In the final cut of his
film, Scott gives the alien a visually minuscule role and yet achieves
what both Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection  totally fail to do, that is,
to have the alien holding sway over  the whole film and dominating all
the human characters  with  its  omnipresent  menace  and malice.  The
subtlety of a gradual  revealing  of  the  adult monster, having first
shocked the unprepared audience with a spontaneous and savage bursting
through the chest of a helpless  human,  means that the audience's own
dark imaginations  are  constantly  at  work,  drawing  shape  to  the
blackness, giving form to  the  unseen  terror  and never once falling
idly into disinterest from a sense  of  reassurance that what they are
being shown is  either  a  puppet,  a  suit,  a  computer  image  or a
combination of all three.

     There is  no  subtlety  in  Alien  Resurrection,  the  aliens are
positively paraded for the cameras.   They  are  shown in the glare of
fluorescent  lighting,  they  are   shown  underwater,  swimming  like
ridiculous, over-sized  tadpoles,  they  are  shown  walking  past the
camera with a tread  that  could  have  been  lifted straight from the
dinosaurs of Jurassic Park or the  ostriches of Fantasia..  [What will
be in the next  alien  instalment  we  wonder?  aliens on skis? aliens
brandishing sub-machine-guns and  driving  tanks?  aliens standing for
parliament..?]  And not  only  are  our  imaginations  disabled by the
explicit, full-frontals and panoramas which  leave nothing left for us
to imagine (however hard we try),  but the excessive amounts of blood,
slime and gunk draw undesired allusions  to  (of all things, that most
hideous program..) Noel's  House  Party..  nooooooO!   The  horror has
nowhere left to hide.  It makes  a  desperate bid to make its presence
felt by trying to cover itself with  darkness, however as it flees the
spotlight, it trips over a  discarded  alien-tongue and falls into one
of the many vats of  gunk  and  drowns,  even it's final death-screech
being smothered into an unnoticed burble by the oozing slime..

     So by the time you reach the  end [should you manage it] you will
think that really, things cannot get any  worse, and it will only be a
mild curiosity towards how  they  will  sew  up  this hammy gash, that
induces you to see out the finale.  And you will at least be surprised
because where you thought it  couldn't  get  any  worse, you will find
you were wrong.  And yes  it  can  descend  even further into cliched,
hackneyed, Hollywood bobbins.  Just pity  Sigourney Weaver who has the
task of imbuing the pitiful lines: "I'm as much a stranger here now as
you are," with some feeling while not laughing at the absurdity of the
sun breaking through the cloud outside  the window (but don't pity her
too much, as I'm sure  letting  her  mind  dwell  on  her fee gave her
inspiration enough..)

Cloying?

sickly?

nauseating?

oh yes.

Truly Hollywood at its best.
