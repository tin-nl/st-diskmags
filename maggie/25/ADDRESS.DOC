Where do I get the latest Maggie online?

ftp.uni-kl.de  [in]  pub/atari/incoming
               [or]  pub/atari/diskmagazines

Who do I contact concerning this diskmag?

CIH's address(es) (see above)..

(The inevitable plea)

Maggie  is  a 'happening' diskmag,  that is,  it 'happens' as and 
when  we have enough articles to do a new issue..  If you want it 
to 'happen' a bit more often,  then some more articles might be a 
good  idea..  Our regular contributors would really enjoy the odd 
new perspective now and again, and who knows, it could be the key 
to eventual fame and fortune for you..

Now  I'm not going to threaten to close the mag if no-one  writes 
in  like  some other diskmag editors tend to do,  we enjoy  doing 
this too much to do that, but I'm really enamoured of the idea of 
sitting  back  and watching a whole host of  third  party  talent 
flood into the mag, prodded along by helpful threats from me, the 
editor..  I  often  have  dreams about it..  Come on,  make those 
dreams come true!! - Write today!
