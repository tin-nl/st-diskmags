                             ~EAT STATIC~

              Cambridge Junction - Tuesday 28th October


     Sitting half-on, half-over a chair, Merv  Pepler looks as if he's
recently been abducted by aliens  and  subjected  to weeks of gruesome
physical experiments.  The much more mundane reality is that he's just
come down from a  gig  in  Glasgow  and  is  feeling  the effects.  On
enquiring after the absent Joie I'm told  that  he's "in bed" - Has he
been abducted/examined/implanted by vicious  aliens?   "Nah, he's just
sleeping."

     Merv has seen it  all,  a  veteran  to  the industry, forming Eat
Static in  1989  as  a  side-project  of  the  Ozric's,  he's probably
answered 'alien questions' too many times  to care.  "Joie saw a craft
once," he ventures before  replacing  his  fag  and  giving it a long,
reassuring drag.  Hmm.. it  would  seem  as  if  even  the unknown can
become prosaic.

     And Merv is not  an  impassioned  guy,  commercial radio fails to
raise his gall, the question  of  'can  techno  really be played live'
induces him to give the magnanimous  view  that:  "I think it can.. it
has a lot to  offer,"  but  doesn't  induce mass hysteria/slaggings of
guitar-based bands.  He gets  vaguely  animated  when  I ask about the
significance of the title of their  new  album, 'Science of the Gods':
"The cover picture is supposed to  be  ambiguous: it could be alien or
human," he says, "it's about how man  thinks he's god."  So it's anti-
religious then?  "Yes, definitely.  It's darker."

     Later, as I'm about to leave  Merv  spots  a cluster of diet coke
cans quaking in a corner of the  table.  Seizing one he cries, "Why do
they keep giving us  this  stuff!   I  specifically  asked for no diet
anything."  I guess it's good to know that there are still some causes
worth fighting for..

     With some six sense we  are  drawn  to  our  feet as support band
'Empirion' fade  out  to  make  way  for  Eat  Static.   Our  eyes are
collectively drawn to  a  giant,  strobing  brain  placed  in the very
centre of the stage.   The  beats  rise,  the  brain  flashes and then
begins to churn with a seething mass of cells.  Everything vibrates as
if an alien mothership  were  hovering  directly  above to provide the
energy for this  raw,  jagged  sound.   The  air  is  pierced with the
shrieks of aliens being tortured.  I feel  the bass hit my stomach and
with a lurch we begin to dance..

                            MODUS OPERANDI


     Precision  is  Rupert  Parke's  'Modus    Operandi'   and  it  is
something he is clearly trying   to   draw   our  attention  to,  from
the textured detail of the back-cover, to the  title  itself: his mode
of operation is something to be admired.

     The album is essentially an  assembly  of carefully collected and
constructed  samples,  nothing  feels  lazy   or  obvious;  depth  and
innovation are what strike us.   From this detailed foundation results
tracks like The Hidden Camera, Smoke Rings and Minotaur, music that is
on the edge, freaky, slightly unnerving.  The sort of stuff that would
be found accompanying an alien-infested, horror film.

     The tracks range  from  drum  and  bass  classics  like  Trans 7,
structured into  a  progression  of  layers,  initially  overlaid with
intensifying samples and drawn out strings,  which send it reeling out
of the speakers, to Modus Operandi, far   more  Jazz than Jungle - the
sort of track which would ooze  out  of  a  saloon followed by several
billowing smoke rings.  Complete  with  its  smattering of club-piano,
it's enough to mellow out even the most essay-stressed student.

     With  no  cheesy  samples,  no  cliched  vocals,  Modus  Operandi
succeeds in doing what the unnecessarily protracted 'New Forms' failed
to do: there is not one  extraneous  blip on this whole album.  Though
some 70 minutes long you   don't  ever  feel   it drag.  Parkes builds
careful loops  of  sound  which  take  you   back  to  earlier tracks,
exploring every eventuality, sending shivers up your aural senses.

     At times you feel as  if  it  is  going to overbalance, erupt and
start screaming, yet it never  does;  the control, the meticulous mind
of Parkes holds it right where he  wants it, not aligned with the soft
ambient Jungle of LTJ Bukem  or  the  manic  style of Mickey Finn, not
even similar to Howie B who   shares  Parkes' Jazz influences; this is
THE Drum and Bass album.  The defining one.  Yep.
