        The ASP SCSI-Burster:- Making SCSI less expensive

        The SCSI Burster range  allows  a  standard  PC case (with or 
without a PC installed in it) to  act  as  a host case for up to seven 
SCSI  devices,  such  as  hard   disks,  CD-ROM's  etc.   An  external 
Centronics connector is mounted  on  a  standard PC expansion bracket, 
and the basic  90cm cable comes  with  three  internal SCSI 50 way IDC 
connectors for connection to devices  compliant  to  the common SCSI 1 
and SCSI 2 busses.  Optional  extras  are further internal connectors, 
longer cable lengths, and  even  an  additional  external connector to 
allow for external cased SCSI products  to be placed after the Burster 
equipped case.

Prices for the Burster range are currently (Spring 1997) as follows:
SCSI Burster cable, (90cm cable, 1 off ext/bkt, 3 off int): 18
Extra External connector/bracket: 9
Extra Internal Connector 1.50
Extra Cable, per 30cm 1.50

       Prices Include delivery by Recorded Post

The standard SCSI  Burster  is  available  ex-stock, delivery normally 
being within two days  of  payment  clearing,  the customised variants 
might take a couple  of  days  extra.  Cheques  and postal orders made 
payable to  "Abingdon  Synthesis  Projects"  ,  and  written inquiries
