                           EPILEPSY WARNING!


TOKYO, DEC 20 1997. Hundreds of  Japanese schoolchildren are rushed to
hospital after viewing  the  latest  issue  of  dUvetcover Magazine on
their VGA  monitors.  Symptoms  included  headaches,  severe vomiting,
braindeath  and  incomprehensible  rambling  about  the  Atari  scene.
Doctors warned that the continual flashing of the screen was to blame.

"It is appalling",  remarked  Dr  Fuji  Bantuji  of  the institute for
mental  insanity   and   rent-a-quote   journalism,   "that   such   a
reprehensible  piece  of  software   has   been   unleashed  upon  the
unsuspecting atari  public.  Exposure  to  the  flickering  screen and
psychedelic articles can cause lasting  damage.  My  best advice is to
only view this magazine with the monitor switched off."

The victims reports were equally  harrowing.  "It was only ten seconds
after I loaded it  that  it  all  began,"  explained  2  year old Huji
Mantuji, one of the magazines  more  mature readers, "the screen began
to flicker uncontrollably. My head began spinning. And then I tried to
read one of the articles..." This  was Huji's fatal mistake. His brain
couldn't comprehened the oscillating nonsense in  front of eyes and he
suffered a haemorrhage. He  is  now  blind,  paralysed from the thighs
upwards and can speak  only  through  a  small  straw.  He  also has a
paranoid phobia of monitors, being unable  to  breathe within a 4 mile
radius of a flickering VGA screen.

The ministry of health were  quick  to  respond with a severe epilepsy
warning. People  are  advised  to  stay  indoors  with  all electrical
appliances safely disconnected.  dUvetcover  magazine  should  only be
read through  a  disk  editor.  Alternatively,  just  read  our  brief
synopsis of the world of Atari according to the dUvetcover staff:
