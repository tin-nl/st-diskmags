These  stubby but finely tapering projections out of hands have  really 
inspired  a  lot  of  third  party  activity  to  design  and   produce 
peripherals   that  make  full  use  of  them..   Who  can  forget  the 
breakthrough that came when 'handles' were produced..  Man and shopping 
bag  in symbiotic man/machine harmony?  And who was that unsung  genius 
who decided to make nostrils *just* the right size for those fingers?!

Now Microsoft have decided to update a design that has essentially been 
trouble-free for the last fifty thousand years,  as we are greeted with 
the prospect of 'Fingers '98..

If  Microsoft follow their normal business practices,  Fingers '98 will 
sound fine in theory,  but will require you upgrade your arms and hands 
to ten times their current capacity at a vast extra cost..  Fingers '98 
will  only  be  able to use recognised  Microsoft  peripherals,  and  I 
believe they are currently rushing the Microsoft 'Fridge Door beta'  to 
the marketplace.. Generally, it looks like Fingers '98 will be woefully 
undersupported  unless  Microsoft  can get third  party  developers  to 
concentrate on it,  and to drop the main alternative (Foetus Inc) which 
currently has a 100% market share.. 

Other, unsubstantiated, stories tell us of occasional hardware failures 
withearlybetasof Fingers '98,  where they sometimes stop working in
mid-clench,  or simply  just  fall off the hand.. Microsoft remain 
tight-lipped about these stories,  but a brief official communique puts
any problems downto user error, or incorrect arm/hand configurations..
However,IthinkthereisalotmoretodobyMicrosoft,beforethey
cansafelyreleasetheseproductstothemarket.

They also remainconfident  of  substantially reducing the hour-long  
boot-up  procedure for Fingers '98 which takes place first thing in the 
morning,  and patchestodealwiththisproblemshould be in place some 
six months after the initial launch..

We are not holding our breath in anticipation!
