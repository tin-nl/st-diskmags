Uh oh! I wish you didn't ask.. :( At the moment it's in the freezer. 
It simply is A LOT of work to say the least and I lost interest, cos 
I'd rather work on th UCM and do some stuff for my new MIDI-program.
But I thought about some fractallandscapes yesterday and I almost 
have some T-mapping finished, so I guess maybe I could start again in 
a few days. (I hope)

  Well, you just did.
  Keep up the great work on your mag. :)

P.S. I know loads of people are waiting for Solos, but I simply need 
to stop it for a while to 'unstress'. During the development of 
Neurbotix I noticed that coding too long on one thing decreases the 
quality of the code and destroys your creativity. 'Botix could have 
been much better if I would have taken the time to figure things out 
at a slower pace. And now that I've learned from that I try to work 
in a new way with Solos. Avoid burning out as much as possible. :)
 BTW Any news on the Phenix? Last thing I heard was that the OS was 
finished, but after that not much... Any info?
