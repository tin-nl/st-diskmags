This demo must go down as one of the best demo's in history!

Upon loading you are presented with a disting 'PLEASE WAIT' logo
and the computer tells you to please wait! (the digi-sound is
taken from Wing's of Death!).

You then go into the intro which is a soundtracker by Chris of TGE 
playing at 15Khz with balls(?) by SPAZ and it's a fullscreen! 
(this sounds good on my ST as i have got it hooked up to a 200
WATT amplifier!!!!)

After pressing space the computer tells you once more to 'PLEASE WAIT'
then you enter the Main Menu. This menu uses the sync scrolling 
technique (used in the Mindbomb demo and Cuddly demos) 
while playing a 15Khz soundtracker (1 MEG ST's ONLY!!) and it's 
another fullscreen!

You guide a flying lion around a landscape with either a joystick or
the cursor keys to the different door's to access the different demos. 
Pressing space allows you to access the different demo-screens.

The Fate of ULM seems to like fullscreen demo's as most of his are
fullscreen!

The hidden demo screen is very impressive with loadsa' sprites moving
around the (full) screen. I lost count after 10 minutes but i
can tell you there are over 100 of them!

Some of the guest screens are good as well. There it the Twiddle
screen by TLB (A weird scroller and planet starfield), The
Canibalistic Deforgy - another screen by TLB (4 demo's in one
while playing a Quartet tune) and a screen by The Respectables.

This demo is a must get!
