 A Code too far??????

This  is  a difficult one to do,  I have been informed  that  this 
combined  TLB/Thalion effort has received a stuffing at the  hands 
of  most of the ST press,  here and abroad,  and now it is my turn 
(To review it.)

(HERE  WE  GO...) Prehistoric Tales is basically a  platforms  and 
ladders  game,  where  you  run around collecting  dinosaur  eggs, 
and avoiding various nasties...  To flesh out this basic scenario, 
you control the hero Cronos Warchild (It gets better...) who looks 
like Biffa Bacon's dad after his pint has been spilled,  Cronos is 
a  time-traveller  who  is sent  by  the  Biological  Regeneration 
Association  (Spot  the acronym time....  Was it deliberate??)  to 
collect  dinosaur eggs and remove them to a safe haven  to  ensure 
the  survival  of  the dinosaur species..  We  are  informed  that 
failure to do so will mean that the dinosaurs will not be able  to 
ensure the evolution of mammals (and later mankind..)

Leaving  aside  the dodgy science,  (I thought mammals  were  only 
helped along by the sudden and catastrophic demise of dinosaurs??) 
We are left with the aforementioned platform game,  where you have 
to  collect  the eggs (three at a time) avoid or step on  the  bad 
guys  who consist of spiders,  swarms of locusts and pterodactyls, 
and in later levels,  worms,  man-eating plants,  etc...  The eggs 
hatch  if left too long and release mini-dinosaurs which you  have 
to  cage  by jumping over them,  if you get it wrong,  points  are 
deducted...

Other  variables  include your energy level,  which  drops  rather 
alarmingly  from  the  recommended 99% if  you  come  into  direct 
contact with any nasties,  also, many of the eggs are hidden under 
boulders,  and  there  are  bonuses in later  levels  including  a 
battery permitting unlimited egg collection, random objects, hats, 
Thalion logos, TLB logos, dinosaur sculls, guitars etc, which give 
bonus points...  The platform levels start off simply enough,  but 
become  much  more complex and tortuous later in the  game,  where 
moving platforms and teleports are featured..

There are also three sub-games which give the opportunity for more 
bonus  points,  the  first  of which is a kind of card  game,  the 
second  being a shooting-gallery,  and the third one being a catch 
the  eggs  in a bucket exercise,  all of these are  fairly  simple 
reaction-testers...

Graphically, a bit disappointing, I feel, although they are nicely 
done (naff hero sprite aside) and well coloured, they are a bit on 
the  small side,  and fall uncomfortably between the  ultra-small, 
ultra-fashionable  LEMMINGS sprites,  and the much bigger  sprites 
found on most other 16 bit games...  In fact, to look at, this may 
well be a Commodore 64 game (albeit with better colours..)

Sonically,  this  holds  up well,  with a number of MAD MAX tunes, 
including  sampled digi-drums which play throughout the game,  you 
also  have  a choice of some fairly functional  in-game  sonix  as 
well...

There  are  some nice touches in the twiddly bits outside  of  the 
game, a scroller, a very nice high score table, end-game graphics, 
which  reflect the demo-writing roots of the authors,  (and  where 
their best programming still is, it seems..)

And so, to the ratings:-

GRAPHIX:-  66% - This percentage given,  mainly for effort  rather 
than  the  end results,  this game has a distinctly  old-fashioned 
look to it....

SONIX:-  80% - A number of very good tunes,  with MAD MAX,  how do 
you go wrong in this department?? Less inspiring sound FX though..

PLAYABILITY:-  67% - A fairly easy game to get to grips with,  but 
not really addictive,  the game does gain some appeal once you get 
to know it better....

OVERALL:-  62%  -  This  percentage is  given  with  two  thoughts 
uppermost  in  my mind...  Firstly,  with what seems like half  of 
Thalion  involved  (just  read the  credits  sometime..)  how  did 
this game turn into something this uninispired?  It seems to be as 
a result of a massive fit of self-indulgence last summer??

Secondly,  although the game is not too bad in itself,  why are we 
expected to pay full-price for it???  It is acceptable as a budget 
game,  or  as  part of a compilation,  but nothing more....  Better 
things from The Lost Boys are still to come...
