	 Elvira, Mistress of the Dark!
	 20 SECONDS
	 This is another great version of the Robocop sample, although it
	 is a lot different from the others. The Sample quality is 
	 excellent, the picture is very well digitized.

DISK 283-THE AMADEUS DEMO (BY FALCO) 
	 The sample is again of very good quality, there is some kind of a 
	 text display on the screen which changes, it is some kind of a
	 scroller. If you have a second disk drive you can use DISK 284 to
	 get an extra long sample demo, if you do not have a drive B, you
	 will have to stick with the first disk. I think this demo is
	 great, not just because I like the song!!!!

DISK 322-THE HARVEY LODDER SAMPLE PLAYER/SEQUENCER
	 This is a great thing, it is a sample player with some really nice

	 be longer. For this sample player you can get various data disks 
	 with excellent sample demos. See the next disk for the actual
	 demos/data disks.
