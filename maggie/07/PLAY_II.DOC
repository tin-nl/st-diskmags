NOTE: Unless you have a very warped mind do not enter this zone of temporal
      insanity, and remember, it's nearly all lies (So don't take it too
      seriously).

This article is intended purely to shock and takes the mickey out of a clean,
light hearted American TV sit-com called Out Of This World which is about as
funny as eating a pubic hair sandwich unless you do what we have done, that is
to bend the rules, pervert the story line and turn it into an X-Rated comedy.
It was shown in Britain last summer but viewers in Germany who can receive
RTL+ can now enjoy this unique blend of bland comedy entitled Mein Vater Ist
Ein Ausserirdischer (I think that means My Father Is An Ashtray). Catch it on
Sundays at 13.00 CET or Cable viewers may tune in at 12 o'clock GMT. Although
the soundtrack has been scrubbed and dubbed into German, the signature tune
has been kept in English. Does "Fock Auf" mean "Wake Up" in German? I was
rather alarmed when Donna tried to wake Evie by shouting "Fuck Off" at her...

Our story starts in the coastal city of Marlowe in the rented summer beach
house of the Garlands. Inside this luxurious hacienda there is a 40 foot square
living room, an MFI kitchen, 2 bedrooms, an airing cupboard and a bog. This is
no ordinary house, far from it. It is in fact the local brothel emporium. Many
celebs have graced the beds of this ole house. One such person is Abe Lincoln,
American president from a long time ago, who is currently doing time in this
oddly shaped house. The proprietor of this listed building is not the man of
the house as you may have thought. This place belongs to Miss Evie Garland, an
all American typical thin teenager (Aaargh!). The reason for this is because
Mrs Garland (Donna) is too busy flashing and chain smoking to look after the
house. From time to time Donna's younger brother pays a visit and also pays
Evie for her services. His name is Beano Failure, an all American fat bastard,
weighing in at 313.3 Kg whilst adorning his loud red cardigan. He wears specs
and speaks amazingly like Freddy from Scooby Doo. There may be some confusion
over the fact that Beano is called Failure and Donna is called Garland. There
is a simple-ish explanation for this. You see way back in 1972 Donna met this
guy called Troy Garland. He looked perfectly human (In fact just like Gary
Bracey of Ocean Software!) but there was more to him than the way that he
looked. Troy Garland was in fact an alien from another planet but after getting
Donna "up the duff" he fucked off back to his own planet Anterious. Nine months
later Donna gave birth to a small thin stick-like baby whom she called Evie.
Everything went well until 1988 when MCA TV in America wanted to cash in on
their misfortune (Evie had inherited special alien-type properties from her dad
which gave her the power to freeze time and grab people and things from various
time dimensions (Who said that Einstien was talking bullshit?)) by giving them
their own TV series. Everything was to be kept hush hush whilst the show was in
production (They even invited the Mayor to appear in various episodes but more
about him later) so that none of the other inhabitants of Marlowe didn't find
out what the fuck was going on. This show (Which must be popular in America)
was titled Out Of This World and they even managed to get Beano and Evie to
sing the signature tune (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-yah!). Oh yes before we go any further
we must point out that Beano being a lovable fat bastard during the day is not
all he seems to be at night, for as the clock strikes midnight Beano transforms
into... SPUDMAN! The fat man who shags all thin women preferably Evie Garland,
his niece and also a thin woman. What a good excuse? What with the crime rate
in America being at an all time high this doesn't seem to bother the Garlands
in the slightest, for their front door is ALWAYS open, NEVER locked. This means
that anybody can walk in at any time. One such person is the city idiot, Buzz
Belmondo, a statuesque Italian who like to sniff lighter fuel in his spare time
which means he is always buzzing the gas hence the name Buzz and his burnt
upper lip (Due to the occasional naked flame from his Embassy lighter). At the
moment this talented man has more jobs than the family in Hey Mon from In
Living Colour on Cable TV. Remember the Mayor? Well he is called Kyle X
Applegate, previously a B-Movie star and world championship "black face for a
white man" contest winner. Funnily enough he bears an amazing resembalance to
Doug McClure, the cowboy helper in The Virgin, sorry The Virginian. Last and
least we have Evie's best friend Lispface (she has a lisp) who is a child
alcoholic. And her boyfriend Chris Yellowhead the bisexual American surfer
ponce who pretends he's getting his cock sucked in the opening titles. One
last piece of vital information. When Troy buggered off home about 13 years
ago he didn't leave completely. He left behind a small ashtray which glows in
the dark and also helps him communicate with his family on Earth (He sounds
just like Bill Cosby too, Ha, ha ha).

Here are the stage props in our story:

Mr Goodie    : The owner of the Goodie Goodie diner, the only local eaterie in
               Marlowe.

Mr Robertson : Evie's mentally unbalanced maths teacher, who uses his megaphone
               to scare pupils into doing their exams (He really exists 'cos I
               got him for O-Grade and partly H-Grade maths).

Old Jobert   : The city smell who needs to be cleaned fast. He smells like an
               old shoe with a shite inside it on a rubbish tip. He also exists
               in real life. He is a student at Marlowe High.

Mullard      : An old delapidated Cockney comedian who now visits Evie from
               time to time with the prime intention of getting a special
               bag squelch. He talks in Cockney rhyme and slang and is partial
               to pissing in hats late at night.

Colonel Defoe: This is the illigitimate half son (His other father is Kyle the
               Mayor) of Buzz Belmondo. Defoe doesn't buzz gas at all, he
               prefers to boggle at various females and is extremely jealous
               of Chris Yellowheads good looks and crimpoline wig.

Now on with the story...

It's Evie's bedroom and there is a lot of commotion going on...

Evie       : Oh, I had a few minutes to kill after fucking Uncle Beano, so I
             thought I'd gas him as well!
Donna      : Oh Evie, you know your uncle has a heart complaint.
Evie       : No, I mean gas him with Buzz's butane!
Donna      : Well be careful, you know that's highly lethal!

Evie starts to smother her Empire Biscuits with cheese when suddenly her Uncle
Beano walks in...

Beano      : Prepared just the way I like it. Red hot boobs covered in
             Californian Nob Cheese!
Evie       : I don't have to take that! Then again, with the right sauce and
             mayo. Don't forget, how fast depends on how big my tits will be!
Beano      : Oh well Jesus Christ, will you look at the size of that?

All of a sudden the broken ashtray in the corner of the room lights up and
says...

Troy       : Holy Fuckspread!
Donna      : I hate the look of it when that happens! I just stubbed my last
             fag out 3 minutes ago.
Abe        : What the fuck's that thing?
Evie       : There's a simple explanation, it's Uncle Beano's dick! Wait, how
             can I compete with 2 centimeter tits?
Beano      : For fucks sake Evie, may I have a blow job?
Evie       : Do you want me to chow down?
Beano      : Unzip me first you immature bitch!
Donna      : Well, it looks mature to me!
Evie       : Mature? 2 centimeter tits? I don't have to take that!
Donna      : Hmm...
Evie       : (Suck, suck, gobble, gobble) It's all right.
Beano      : Aarrghh! Jesus, I've made a fucking mess on the carpet! Ah, it'll
             be OK!
Donna      : It maybe OK with you, but I'm not having a large white patch
             surrounding my fireplace!

Later in the Goodie Goodie diner, Kyle is looking for some service...

Kyle       : Evie, I ordered 3!
Evie       : Aren't 2 melons enough? Oh, I'll bring you another one!
Beano      : I want another blow job - NOW!
Evie       : Uncle Beano! The gravitational force from your bloated stomach
             appears to be pulling your dick upwards! Wait, I'll fix it for
             you and you'll die with a smile on your face!

Later... After Uncle Beano's blow job

Mr Goodie  : Don't worry Evie, I'll clean it up!
Evie       : Hi Mayor Applegate, may I help you?
Kyle       : Can I get my suck job later? I'll pay you for it!
Evie       : Wow! OK Mayor.
Mr Goodie  : Evie! What are you doing?
Evie       : Excitement, pleasure and leather!

A little more later still whilst Kyle is getting his suck job...

Evie       : Here you go!
Donna      : I can't believe my eyes! Her tits have never been that big!
Kyle       : Evie, I can't get my hands round these!
Evie       : Oh, and I suppose you expect me to go and deflate them!
Beano      : You know Evie, they look even smaller on TV!
Evie       : That's a great idea Beano. Get a TV!
Donna      : Alright, I'll pinch Beano's 6 incher!

A bit more later, after the fetching of the television...

Buzz       : I will give you 8 hours of fun and frivolity in a mere 30 seconds!
Kyle       : Here I go! (GRAPPLE)
Evie       : Oow!
Beano      : Aaagh! I've just made another white mess on the carpet!
Buzz       : Underay, underay!
Kyle       : I'm going to make a celebrity endorsement!
Buzz       : Yaheah! I'm finding it very difficult to fill Evie's pants!
Kyle       : Buzz, what the hell are you doing with my bit?
Buzz       : Ah! I have come to a conclusion.
Kyle       : Yeah, on my foot.
Evie       : Come on guys! You're supposed to be enjoying yourself!
Kyle       : How can I with that Italian prick sharing your fanny?
Buzz       : I would say that my prick is more like a snake!
Kyle       : I would say your prick is more like a pritt-stick!
Evie       : Settle down, or I'll have to stop.
Buzz, Kyle : Nononononononono!!
Donna      : Beano, have you cleared up your accident on the carpet yet?
Beano      : Say Donna, I think this is wasted!
Donna      : Beano! That was my dish cloth!
Beano      : Oh brother.

After all the fun and frivolity...

Buzz       : I still think it would have been better without the Mayor, Evie!
Evie       : Buzz, he paid me first. No, wait a minute he didn't pay me at all!
Buzz       : Ah, the between fanny fucker!
Evie       : I agree totally! Fucking titwanker.
Beano      : Say Evie, are you alright?
Evie       : No, Mayor Applegate didn't pay his fare!
Beano      : What about you Buzz?
Buzz       : Woe is me!
Beano      : Buzz?
Buzz       : Yes.
Beano      : Fuck off you Eye-talian bastard, you're a bloody liar.
Evie       : Uncle Beano, don't you think that was a bit hard?
Beano      : It's been harder, but it was considerably hard 2 minutes ago!
Evie       : Uncle Beano. I meant hard on Buzz!
Beano      : Me and him! Who do you think I am? A poof?
Evie       : I give up!
Donna      : Well Evie, how much have you earned this week?
Evie       : Well Mom, only five thousand bucks!
Beano      : Don't you mean five thousand fucks?
Evie       : Uncle Beano, fuck off and die!
Donna      : Beano. Go and have a wank in the airing cupboard!
Beano      : If you say so Bitch!
Donna      : Sometimes I don't know I why our mother didn't have an abortion!
Evie       : What? Uncle Beano was going to be terminated?
Donna      : Yes, way back in 1929!
Evie       : Wow! Uncle Beano is 62! That's old!
Donna      : Mmm, brinking on senility I'd say!
Evie       : Hey, what If I started including elderly people in my list...(CUT)
Mullard    : Ah cood fancee fat buurd!
Beano      : Say Donna, Evie bit off my Helmet!

Behind the pub...

Evie       : Uh, ahhhhh, ooooh, Uh, huh! Yah-yah-yah-yah!
Mullard    : Cooooooor, spurrt!
Evie       : (Ching!) Two pounds fifty bucks please.
Mullard    : Cor! Wooood free and sixpence do?
Evie       : I suppose so, I've got to go and strip off at Lindsay Lispfaces
             birthday party in the pub now you see.
Mullard    : Fuck! I've got no munee.
Evie       : Oh well then, you'll have to wash Spudmans undies!
Mullard    : (CLUNK) Coooor. I've ad an epoleptic siesure! Arrrghhh!

At the Birthday Party...

Lispface   : Hallo Evie. You're my betht pal, ya fucking whore!
Evie       : Gee, Thanks Lispface! Any vodka left?
Lispface   : Nup, I'm afraid I've conthoomed it all!
Evie       : You bloody greedy bitch, I'll scratch your clitoris out!
Lispface   : Thut up or I'll thmath thith bottle of vodka over your thiny
             hairdo!

Evie attacks Lispface and they fall in a bundle onto the floor...

Lispface   : Naahh, you're my betht pal. Leth have it off!
Evie       : Yeah. Let's have.... An orgy!!!

Suddenly 50 million people descend upon Evie Garland's box. Loud noises can be
heard emitting from the pub punctuated by a frequent "Say Evie!" and by a less
frequent "Yah-yah-yah-yah" from Evie's corner.

Next morning...

Lispface   : Jethuth Critht, My cunt feelth ath if it hath had a double decker
             buth inthide it... Thhit what ith Arthur Mullard doing on top of
             me?
Mullard    : Cooooooooooooooor! Wahs fat smell of booze 'n fish?
Lispface   : Fuck. I'll have to have an aborthion!

Later in the morning at school...

Robertson  : Right class. I hope ye did yer hamework and revision for the wee
             test ah'm goin' te give ye today.
Evie       : Oh heck, what fucking test?
Robertson  : Ah, Miss Garland, the fucking calculas test!
Evie       : Oh!
Lispface   : Evie, don't you think that Mithter Roberthon is thexy?
Evie       : Get to fuck Lispface!
Lispface   : I'll give you a bottle of whithkey if you take Mithter Roberthon
             into that thmall cupboard and give him the fucking of hith life!
Evie       : OK, you're on Boozy, how much?
Lispface   : Like I thaid. A nith big juithy bottle of whithkey!
Evie       : I don't drink, remember?
Lispface   : Oh, tho you don't! Oh well, howth about 20 buckth!
Evie       : 20 bucks?! I couldn't buy a deluxe vibro for that!
Lispface   : My lath offer. 25 buckth!
Evie       : You're on!

After the lesson...

Evie       : Em, Sir!
Robertson  : Yes Evie.
Evie       : I'd just like to say, em, that I think your striped purple shirt
             looks nice! Especially alongside your lovely straw hat!
Robertson  : Ah, aye. I thought so maself!
Evie       : Mmm, Sir, I don't suppose I can...
Robertson  : Yes?
Evie       : I can!
Robertson  : Whit? Can ye whit?
Evie       : Em, I don't suppose I could, take you into the cupboard and give
             you...
Robertson  : Your hamework?
Evie       : No, a blow job!
Robertson  : Well, em, whit's that?
Evie       : Jeez, you don't know what a blow job is?
Robertson  : Well, aye, it just seems to have slipped my mind at the moment,
             that's all.
Evie       : Let's hope so. Take your Oxford Bags off!
Robertson  : Ah cannae! Ah'm no wearing anything underneath!
Evie       : That's a good start!

The two enter the cupboard, and after 10 minutes of what sounds like someone
who's tosils were being taken out whilst doing an impersonation of Orville the
Duck, old Robertson staggers out of the melting hot cupboard...

Robertson  : My Goad! Ah'm totally flummoxed!
Evie       : Yeah, me too! But I'm used to it!
Robertson  : What's that supposed to mean?
Evie       : Um, nothing Sir!
Robertson  : Right Miss Garland, ye can go noo. Oh and ye goat an "A" in the
             test.
Evie       : Thank you Sir!

As she walks out the door, she winks at Robertson. Robertson walks over to
the window for some fresh air but before he gets there he collapses onto the
floor. Verdict: Exhaustion.

Outside in the "playground"...

Lispface   : Well Evie, did you do it?
Evie       : Of course I bloody well did, now give me my 25 bucks!
Lispface   : I'm afraid I thpent it on booth!
Evie       : Booze bloody booze. Is that all you ever think about?
Lispface   : Yeth!

Evie turns round and heads off towards the snack bar... There she meets Chris
Yellowhead, a bisexual show-off.

Evie       : Gee Chris, I didn't know you went to this dump.
Yellowhead : Yes. I've got no option girl.

Suddenly, Evie eyes are transfixed on Robert Hearty's trousers...

Evie       : Um, who's that over by the counter?
Yellowhead : Him, aw that's old Jobert Farty, sorry Robert Hearty!
Evie       : I think I'll go over and speak to him!

Evie walks in a tart-ish sort of way over to old Jobert...

Evie       : Hi, your name's old Jobert isn't it?
Jobert     : Aye, I mean naw, it's Robert!
Evie       : I couldn't help noticing that rather large lump in your trousers!
Jobert     : Where? Where?
Evie       : (WHISPERING) I wouldn't worry about it! I can put it to good use!
Jobert     : Um, er!

Poor old Jobert. He was left totally speechless...

Later as old Jobert is about to go for a piss round the back of the school...

Jobert     : I'll just nip roond for a pee. I'll be back in a meenit!
Yellowhead : Alright.
Evie       : Hi there Chris!
Yellowhead : How you doing?
Evie       : Better in a minute! Em, Chris I think I just saw Colonel Defoe
             trying to set fire to your crimplene wig!
Yellowhead : What! Em, thanks Evie, bye.

Hence Yellowhead takes off faster than Wee Hughey with Turbo-Boost...

Jobert     : Oh, you again!
Evie       : Yes Jobert... come here!

Evie pushes Jobert into the boys bogs and she goes in with him...

Inside the bogs...

Jobert     : Whit dae ye intend tae dae wi me?
Evie       : Whatever tickles my fancy!
Jobert     : Whit aboot ma hand?
Evie       : Perhaps!

Just as Jobert and Evie are about to start rumpy pumpy they hear extremely
weird squelchy noises coming from the middle cubical...

Evie       : Whattheheck's that?
Jobert     : Hing oan, I'll peer under the door! Jesus. There's a yellow heeded
             guy sucking Mr Brodie's willy!
Evie       : Mr Brodie?
Jobert     : Aye, he's the daft PE teacher. I knew he was daft, but I didnae
             ken he was queer!
Evie       : Who's the guy with the yellow hair?
Jobert     : (COVERING UP) Ah don't know... Ah've never seen him before.
Evie       : Move! Let me have a look!

Evie peers over the door and to her horror sees her old pal Chris Yellowhead
in a number 69 with Joppa Brodie...

Evie       : Bloody hell!
Jobert     : Ah ken, black init?
Evie       : Not really... I wouldn't mind doing it!
Jobert     : ?!
Evie       : No, it's the yellow haired guy in there!
Jobert     : Whit aboot him?
Evie       : He just had to be my old boyfriend!
Jobert     : Ha ha ho hoo ho ha ha! (WHAMM)
Evie       : That's for being very rude you smelly little shit. You've blown
             your chances of a shag from me!

Evie leaves the boys bogs and sets off for her next lesson. In the classroom...

Evie       : Hey Lispface, guess what I saw in the boys johns!
Lispface   : Nup, can't gueth, you'll have to tell me the anthwer!
Evie       : Oh, only a crate of Scotch!
Lispface   : A crate of Thcotch! Only! I need to have it now!
Evie       : Ha ha, what an incredibly alchoholic asshole!

Boarding the crowded school bus we meet Stan the perverted driver and Jack the
perverted conductor...

Jack       : Bor Climey Mate! Look at that smart-tart! Woaarr!
Stan       : Yeah! Mind you, she's not got very big headlights!
Jack       : Hey mate, I think I'll go and give her ticket a good clipping!
Stan       : You do that mate. Whooaar.
Jack       : (On Helium) Thenk yer! Bor Climey Evie. Where's yer TICKET?
Evie       : Fuck, I ain't got no money. But if you let me off with the fare
             I'll show you a good time in the boot!
Jack       : BOR CLIIIIIIIIIIIMEE!!!!!!!!!

In the boot...

Jack       : Bo, Bor, ooohh, wooor, nanaa. Climey! I think I've just Borred

Evie       : Have you come?

             on fire.
Evie       : That's OK, I'll put it out with my period pie!
Jack       : Bor, Blooooarrrghh!!

At the Depot...

Jack       : Bor Climey mate! I hit it off with her and no mistake!
Stan       : Who's that mate? That whore Evie?
Jack       : Climey mate! How'd you figure that out?
Stan       : Easy mate! You smell of Climey!
Jack       : Climey mate!
Stan       : Yeah Climey to you too!
Jack       : Ere mate, you been out with that bird Lindsay Lispface yet?
Stan       : Naa, anyway she's under age and a drunkerd!
Jack       : Whoar! Evie's underage but I still had a rolicking time with her!
Stan       : You've got a point there mate! Ere, what's her telephone number?
Jack       : Dunno mate, I don't think she got a phone!
Stan       : Bleedin' hell mate!
Jack       : Yeah, I think she traded it in for a gallon of Whiskey!
Stan       : Bleeeeeeediin' hell!!
Jack       : Corr! She must be desperate!
Stan       : Bleeeeeeediin' hell!!

It's 7 o'clock, and Stan prepares to go to Lispface's house and take her out!
He arrives at her front door...

Stan       : Ah well, here goes.

He rings the door bell, and Lispface answers it...

Lispface   : Yeth!
Stan       : Ere, I was wondering, like, if I could em, take you out on an erm,
             date? Yes, a date!
Lispface   : You want me to go out with you on a date?

Lispface   : I'll pretend my eerth never heard that!
Stan       : Yeah yeah. Look, are you coming out?
Lispface   : That dependth.
Stan       : Depends on what?
Lispface   : Dependth on whether you can buy me a big bottle of booth when we
             get to where we're going!
Stan       : Oh yeah, but aren't you just a little bit underage for booze?
Lispface   : I'll kick you in the ballth for thaying that!
Stan       : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just thought you were only 14!
Lispface   : Yeth, thatth correct! But I have a conthuming age of 34!
Stan       : Bleeeeeeeeeedin' hell!
Lispface   : Are we going to thith doo or not?
Stan       : Right, well let's go!

They set off in Stan's bus to the GA Club and adjoining bars...

Once at the bar...

Stan       : Right my dear, what will it be?
Lispface   : Well, I'll have half a glath of Thandy, 1 bottle of Vodka, 4 half-
             pintths of Beer, 1 Bacardi and Coke and to top it all, a nith
             juithy pot of Whithkey!
Stan       : Jesus Christ! Right, coming up!
Gibby      : Ah, well that'll be $64.52 please!
Stan       : Gawd, will 3 and 6 do?
Gibby      : What? No way old man, $64.52 or no drink!
Lispface   : Ith there a problem?
Gibby      : You could say that Miss!
Stan       : But, but why's the currency in dollars?
Gibby      : Because, I find it easier to count at the end of the day!
Stan       : Fair enough, Lispface?
Lispface   : Yeth?
Stan       : I don't suppose you could lend me $64.52 please?
Lispface   : Pith off! You're thuppothed to be taking me out, tho you pay!

Suddenly, Jack (Stan's mate) enters the bar...

Jack       : Bor Climey mate, you had it off with her yet?
Stan       : Shut it mate! I bleeding well can't afford the booze she ordered!
Jack       : Bor Climey!
Stan       : Yeah, and no mistake. Have you got $64.52 on you?
Jack       : Climey, what do you think I'm made of? Money?
Stan       : But they use dollars in here, not shillings!
Jack       : Bor! That's bleeding odd!
Lispface   : Can I have my booth pleath!
Stan       : In a minute luv, after I've aquired the right amount of lolly!
Jack       : You're really in the shit now mate! Ha ha ha!
Stan       : Oh gawd! Come on luv, we're leaving, sorry Mr Gibson, cancel the
             order!
Gibby      : I fucking well can't do that!

Stan and Lispface promptly exit the bar, with Jack left to pay the bill...

Gibby the barman glares at Jack...

Gibby      : I trust that you're going to pay for all this half-drunk booze?
Jack       : Climey! Um, I don't suppose it could wait till tomorrow morning?
Gibby      : No.

We leave the bar with Gibby picking Jack up by the scruff of the neck and
punching the crap out of his over-sized hooter...

Next morning in the Garland's (rented) Summer Home...

Evie       : Ah, what a fucking marvelous morning!
Donna      : Yes, what did you do last night? I never heard you coming in.
Evie       : Well Mom, let's just say it was a quiet night last night!
Donna      : I hope you aren't on the game again Evie! Isn't the allowance
             I give you enough?
Evie       : No offence Mom, but you couldn't buy one of Del Trotter's condoms
             with my allowance!
Donna      : Shut your fucking face kid! Are you on the game again?
Evie       : Of course I bloody well am!
Donna      : Ah, that's alright then honey.

We end this little story the same way we started it, with Beano coming in and
sitting down beside Evie at the breakfast table, and demanding a good hard
shag.

The rest, as they say, is back at the beginning...
