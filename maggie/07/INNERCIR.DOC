                             presents
                         THE DECADE DEMO

A review by Leon O'Reilly

Just who are these Inner Circle geezers then?
They are a group of various british crews including:
Electronic  Images,   The  Resistance,  ST  Squad,  Red  herrings, 
Fingerbobs and Hotline.
I first saw this demo at the ECES and I thought.
"Gimme, gimme, gimme!"
Now I've got it and pretty damn good it is too.

On  loading  up this demo you are presented with a screen  with  a 
smooth  scrolling background and distorting text rather like  the 
intro screen of the famous union demo.
Pressing a key takes you into the intro sequence.
9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1..
The music here is good,  although it isn't sampled.  It starts off 
just as a hiss and this hiss fades out as the music fades in.Cool.
The screen is also very nice.  There is a nice starfield,  in  the 
middle is a distorting Inner Circle logo. Moving rapidly round the 
screen  are  sprites  with a letter in them making  up  the  words  
INNER CIRCLE. A decade demo logo scrolls up from the bottom of the 
screen.
This is actually one of the best screens on the disk.
Pressing a key takes you to the main menu. This is very similar to 
the  union  demo.  You  control a little droid  thingie  around  a 
corridor with the cursor keys. To enter a door, press space.
Along  the  bottom  of this main menu is a scroller  with  a  most 
delightful font. The actual corridor overscans into two borders as 
does the scroller.
Lets have a butchers at some screens
RASTERSCROLL by COUNT ZERO of ELECTRONIC IMAGES
Nay bad.  The main feature of this demo is a scroller in the lower 
border whose font uses all 512 colours.  This looks quite nice but 
is too small to absolutely stunning.
At the top of the screen is an agitated COUNT ZERO logo.
In  the  middle of the screen are a series of grids  scrolling  in 
parallax.  Over these is a strip of film with tiny sprites  moving 
in each frame.  What it all means,  I don't no but it looks  quite 
good.
GIGADISTORTER by ST SQUAD
This  starts  off  crap  with two sets  of  volume  bars,  a  tiny 
distorting STS logo,  three sets of sprites (2 ST sprites and  one 
STS). There is a bouncy scrolline using a really crap font.
Then it gets worse - only jesting. A tuns of scrollines filling up 
the whole screen wibble vertically.  The font used is the one used 
in the bat demo methinks.
INSIGNIFICANT by FINGERBOBS
This  is  a mega screen!  I love it!  Nice GFX  of  some  creature 
clutching  a  Fingerbobs logo hardware scroll  up  the  screen,  a 
boring scroller adorns the bottom of the screen and in the  middle 
are a series of ball sprites moving in various patterns.
The music is excellent.  Count Zero has excelled himself,  this is 
one  of the best soundchip compositions I've heard on the  ST.  Its 
good to see a group sticking to its principles, when they can come 
out with music like this who needs to rip music? Watch out Jochen!
WHERE'S WILLY by ELECTRONIC IMAGES
I don't really understand the title of this screen.  Its  probably 
what Phantom says when he tries to go to the toilet.
This  screen is really rather pathetic,  they could've plotted  at 
least 13.53 sprites in the processor time they had left.
All that happens is that a picture appears in the top half or  the 
screen  and  two  distorter bars move over it  for  a  while  then 
another  picture appears and the same thing happens.  This may  be 
quite interesting but there are only four pictures.
Along the bottom of the screen which changes from being feeble  to 
being extremely feeble.
Overall, pathetic.
PARALLAX SCROLL by THE RESISTANCE
Where am dat potato?
This is a highly original screen,  its good to see that the  Inner 
Circle don't rip ideas, just code!
Manikin  sent TR the sourcecode to his famous parallax  screen  on 
mindbomb. Then TR release a parallax screen. Spooky eh?
Apart from that I must admit I do rather like this screen.  It  is 
almost  a  fullscreen  with  a dual scroller  in  top  and  bottom 
borders.  In  the  middle of the screen is where  all  the  action 
happens.  There is omni-directionally scrolling background made up 
of  TR tiles.  A foreground which looks like Griff has sneezed  on 
his  monitor  scrolls  vertically.  A  huge  font  moves  smoothly  
through the middle of the screen.
A complete ripoff, but still quite nice.
SOLID 3D SCREEN by RED HERRINGS
Also  known as the Amiga emulator.  This screen is so funny it  is 
worth a look.  Its starts off with some average speed 3D  objects, 
drunk starfield and an original scroller - get this,  they've made 
up a complete font from the Megadeth logo.  Why didn't anyone else 
think of doing that?
The  later 3D objects are so slow you begin to wonder if  you  are 
owning  an  Amiga.  They seemed to move paraletically  around  the 
screen with astounding jerky animation.  Some objects do like nice 
close  up but they spend most of their time jerking about  in  the 
distance.
Sorry  Red  Herrings  but have you seen the  Beat-Nick  screen  on 
life's a bitch? Now that's how you move 3D objects about!
HOTLINE by HOTLINE
"Hello this is Commissioner Gordon. Get me Batman!"
Oops,  wrong kind of Hotline. These are a group of coders who live 
in  a  cave in the Amazon jungle (I think) and they have  come  up 
with a mind numbingly boring demo.
The first screen is promising. A big Hotline logo shimmers while a 
few sprites bounce about getting reflected in the border like  the 
Red Sector demo on mindbomb. There is some OK music by Joara. 
The  next  screen  is so boring it makes  learning  all  the  GURU 
Meditation numbers from the Amiga seem interesting. 
There  is a face in the middle of the screen and a  scroller  that 
has various patterns. Fetch me some caffine before I fall asleep.
FLEXISCROLL
This is similar to Hotline's screen but there is more to it.
Dual  scrollers wibble and wobble up the side of the  screen  (but 
don't fall down). Along the bottom are some volume bars.
In the middle are some parallax scrolling layers,  a background of 
TR tiles and a foreground of snot.  Over this are some interesting 
scrolly  FX not disimilar from HOTLINE.  There is a circle  scroll 
(Like  on life's a bitch).  Apparently an Amiga crew called  'Wild 
Copper' (The only wild coppers I know are the ones that chase  you 
for underage drinking) said that a circle scroll was impossible to 
do on an ST. Hohahahahohahahohahoahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!
These Amiga crews really do have a sense of humour! Next they'll be 
telling us that 7.14 is more than 8!  TR 'do' the circle  scroller 
at 50Hz! 
A nice screen,  much better than Hotline's.  Griff probably ripped 
all  hotline's code to make it though!  Also who does the GFX  for 
the resistance? They really are shit!
WOW SCROLL 2 by THE RESISTANCE
This is one of the best screens on the disk.  If you said WOW!  to 
TCB's scroller on the union demo then you'll say it twice to  this 
screen.
A 15.8Khz sample of Krush's house arrest accompanies this demo.
The  big  background  uses  full  (almost)overscan.  Unlike  TCB's 
screen,  it  doesn't say "THE UNION - NEEDS NO CUSTOM  CHIPS"  but 
"THE INNER CIRCLE - NEEDS NO BRAINS".  Seriously,  it gives a list 
of IC members and says:
"IC  uses  no ripped GFX (You can tell!),  no ripped code  and  no 
ripped music". I'd love t see the length of Griff's nose now.
A huge multi-colour font scrolls through the middle of the screen.
This  is a very good screen and I bet the resistance  didn't  even 
take a tiny peek at TCB's code.
3D MANIA by ELECTRONIC IMAGES
After  seeing Red Herring's screen I was wary of anything on  this 
demo that said 3D.  This is OK I suppose,  but nothing stunning. A 
load of dots spin about the screen making 3D shape.  Visually  its 
unremarkable,  blue dots on a black background with black  borders 
and a pink scroller. This program supposedly allows you to control 
the  dots  by  altering various  parameters.  They  are  about  as 
controllable as a steering-wheelless Reliant robin with bald tyres 
and  frayed brake wires on an ice rink.  If EI are trying to  beat 
TLB's 3D balls then isn't the way to do it!
VECTOR SCREEN by THE RESISTANCE
This  consists  of a starfield through which  many  3D  wireframe 
vector  shapes grow and shrink.  The objects and  starfield   move 
fast  (Red Herrings take note!).  There are quite a lot of  vector 
images which appear and they all move relatively smoothly.
I  do feel a lot more could be done with this screen.  The ST  can 
display 16 colours on screen,  and using interrupts many more. On 
this  screen  we have a black background,  white stars  and  white 
vector  images - it would be easy to convert to  monochrome!  Also 
the  objects aren't filled 3D,  just empty wireframe.  This  looks 
extremely basic - everyone nowdays used filled 3D.  Take a look at 
the Beat-Nick screen on life's a bitch!
MIX-U-LOAD by COUNT ZERO
This demo is quite original even though the count admits he  stole 
the idea from Rob 'Where are you now?' Hubbard. When you enter you 
see  a  mini fireworks display (sort of) and have  the  choice  of 
choosing  one of two tunes,  the Mini Monty Mix or the  Mega  Drum 
Jam.  Once you've picked (not your bum,  the tune!) you enter  the 
main mixing desk.  This has a scroller along the bottom and  three 
sprite (MIX,  U, LOAD) which are scaled according to the volume of 
the music. All you can do is change the instrument that is playing 
to one of the following:
Throb,  flick, kick, tone, buzztone, zuzzy, touch, boinf, splingl, 
hiblock,  loblock,  flute,  ZZ down,  ZZ up, ZZ top (Sorry, I just 
made that one up!)
This isn't too fun as the music isn't sampled just normal. So when 
you change instrument it may change from Bleep to Bleeeeeeeeep  or 
from Bleep to bleepeeepeepep. It is all really rather dull.
PIPEWORK by ST SQUAD
A demo from the ST Squad and its not a sample demo! Shock horror!
This demo features a big Inner Circle sprite which jogs around the 
screen.  The  main  feature  of this demo  is  the  six  identical 
scrollines  scrolling up the screen,  this font thins out  at  the 
bottom  making it look like it is being wrapped round  a  pipe.  I 
can't wait for the ST Squads follow up to this screen, Tetrahedan-
work where a scrolline is wrapped round a tetrahedan. 
QUARTET SCREEN by COUNT ZERO and ROGGIE
This is the piece de resistance!  Wow!  Dig it!  Groove is in  the 
heart! Wap bam boogie! Ow ee oo! Oo o!
This  screen is seriously good,  90 minutes of 4  channel  sampled 
quartet music!  Absolutely stunning!  I love it, I love it, I love 
it!  Count Zero has come up with some really great tunes here.  My 
favourite  is 'On the run' its got a westerny flavour to it and  I 
can't help thinking it'll become the theme tune to young guns 3.
Other tracks I like include 'The intergrated man' and some of  the 
conversions.  There is a fantastic remix of Jochen's tune from the 
level 16 fullscreen.  I agree with count zero,  the original piece 
was  far  too  short,  this version is far  too  good!  There  are 
conversions  of tunes from the Cuddly Main menu and  cuddly  reset 
screens  and also a remix of knucklebusters which  sounds  nothing 
like the original. 
Roggie's tunes are very good, but not quite up to the standard of 
Count Zero's. Roggie seems to like his tunes running at 500Mph! 
They all seem to be at the maximum tempo possible. Some of his 
tunes have appeared before and they're all worth listening to. I 
wish all Roggie's tunes were as good as the awesome 'Echoes' on 
Slaytanic Cult 2.
This  screen makes the demo worth buying.  It is the  screen  that 
appears on my monitor the most, it's like having a complete record 
collection! Just great!
All EI have to do now is code some efficient digisynth routines so 
they can play some of this excellent music in other screens! 
RESET SCREEN
This  consists of a lot of marbles bouncing about on a  background 
that looks like it consists of more than the normal 16 colours.

OVERALL
This really is a classy demo,  and I liked it.  Inner Circle  have 
obviously  worked  very  hard on this project and  they  can  give 
themselves a big pat on the back. No-one expected a demo this good 
from them. 
Thats not to say I haven't any reservations.  They say they  don't 
rip code, GFX or music, and they use Jochen Hippel music, TLB code 
and  SPAZ's megadeth font.  They shouldn't make such a  big  issue 
about their morals when they obviously don't abide by them.
I  think  they  asked  a lot much of Count  Zero,  he  had  to  code 
squillions of tunes, and, as Brucey would say, didn't he do well! 
He has established himself as the best ST musician in the country, 
and some of his work rivals Jochen Hippel. 
In  my  opinion the most talented member of Inner Circle  are  the 
Fingerbobs, it a shame they didn't do any more screens.
A question to all you at Inner Circle,  how come there weren't any 
screens from the Dynamic Duo in the Decade demo?  Answer me if you 
dare!


GRAPHICS:      7
SOUND:         10
AMOUNT ON DISK:9
CODING:        7.5
OVERALL:       8.5


This demo isn't up to the standard of Mindbomb or Cuddly,  but no-
one  expected  it  to  be.  It is good enough  and  should  be  in 
everyones demo collection. If you haven't got,  get it and get it 
toddie!
