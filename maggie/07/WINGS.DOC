I know this game was reviewed by Mike in the last issue of Maggie but
I felt that his article was rather short and since this is an amazing
game I feel it deserves a longer review, so hear goes...

This game was entirly developed by demo coders under the name Eclipse
and sold by Thalion and as you probably know, demos have 512 colours
on screen, complex scrolling routines, fast sprite routines and the
ability to play 4 samples at the same time using up very little
processor time. Well this game contains all of the above!

Let's just run down the list of people who worked on the game....

        Coding                :     Marc Rosocha
	Graphixx              :	    Erik Simon (or better know as
				    ES of TEX!)
	Music & Sound fx      :     Jochen Hippel (alias Mad Max
 				    also of TEX!)
	Title digisound routs :     Tim Moss (Manikin of TLB)
				    and Jochen Hippel (Mad Max)
	Additional Graphixx   :     Gunther Schmitz (Double dots
 				    over the "U"!)
				    Niclas Malmqvist (Tanis of TCB)
				    and Michael Grohe
	Voice                 :     Tim "The Man" Moss (Manikin)
	Manual, Novel & Ideas :     Richard Karsmakers
				    (You must be on another planet
				    if you've never heard of this
				    guy!!)

Other people who helped are....

	Chris Jungen, Niclas Thisell (Nick of TCB), Karsten Koeper,
	Klaus Peter Pong, Lothar Becks, Tim & Dave Moss (Manikin and
	SPAZ of TLB), Michael Krause, Jens Goebel, Michael Bittner
	(B.. B.. B.. B.. Bittner!) and Fabian Hammer.

Now then let's get on with the review...

You are Sagyr the magician and you are up against the forces of
the Evil Xandrilla, you have to fly him (because he has been
transformed from a juman to a bat!!) across 7 levels of destructive
action.

Upon insterting the disk a blue screen appeard and some wonderful
Jochen music starts to play (some people might reckognise this
music!). Then some droplets of water fall down the screen and four 
faint triangles move around the screen and form the Thalion logo, 
the word Thalion comes down the screen and sits in the middle of 
the triangles to complete the logo. 

Press space again and some more loading is done then the Eclipse 
logo appears, and then you see a great Spectrum 512 picture appears
drawn by ES.

Press space again and you see a picture off a two headed dragon
with wings and the words "Wings of Death" in front of it. At the
bottom of the screen the credits appear and the copyrights etc.
backed with a 4 channel sampled tune with some great samples such
as "prepare to die" and "Wings of Death".

Press space and you are told to insert disk B (Yes it's on two
disks!).

This game is a bit like the Union demo in the sense that it uses
what you have got, e.g. if you've got 1 meg it will utilise that
or if you've got a blitter or STE it will use the machines 
advanced features! Another good option is the ability to output
in game music and speech in stereo on an STfm (Monster Stereo
and Pro Sound Designer only!)

The actual game has got great graphixx and whats more the game
sets the hertz rate to 60 to make the game play faster (good
thinking there guys!). While playing you are treated some
mouth watering graphixx while playing some Jochen music with
digi-drums.

Whenever you collect and weponary or lives etc there is digitised
speech telling you what you have collected (The speech is actually
Manikin of TLB!).

There are about 100 sprites on screen an the same time and some
of them are massive and the computer doesn't slow down one bit!
now thats amazing!

The game is very tough and don't expect to finish it the same day
(unless you have the cheat code!).

This game could be the game of 1991!

I would say that this game is better than Xenon 2 but that's my
opinion. If you want a good blast then this is the game for you!
