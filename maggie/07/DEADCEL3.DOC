  This  is a somewhat more sombre DEAD CELEBRITIES spot  than  the 
last two issues, as it deals with the end of production of no less 
than the baseline ST, the STFM!!

It  now  seems  certain,  that with the recent STE price  drop  to 
œ300.00 (UK) and the replacement of the STFM-based Discovery pack, 
with the Discovery Xtra, containing an STE, that the STFM has only 
got  a limited future,  and pretty soon (After Xmas?) the 'FM will 
be discontinued..

This  can be seen as inevitable,  in the light of Atari  launching 
several  new ST models in the coming year,  the MEGA STE being the 
soonest,  with  such items as the ST PAD and NOTEBOOK machines  to 
follow.  Atari UK's current advertising is for the whole family of 
ST-based machines,  starting at the STE,  as the baseline machine, 
moving  on to the Mega STE,  and selling the TT as the top of  the 
range (The first time the TT has been widely advertised) The  poor 
old 'FM is nowhere to be seen...

It is not known,  at this time whether production has stopped yet, 
but  it is beyond doubt that Atari will be pushing out the STE  in 
larger than ever numbers for this coming Xmas, and it must come to 
a stage soon,  where the only STFM's left to sell, are remaindered 
stock..

In  spite  of the above,  there are still a lot of STFM's  in  the 
world,  and  the  STE and other machines are only slowly  going  to 
replace  them,  if you remember how long it has taken double-sided 
disk  drives  on 512k machines to gain acceptance,  then there  is 
nothing to fear for a long time yet...

So  it  is farewell ST,  long live the STE (But not until the  new 
year  probably,  then  again,  how many new ST's are STFM's  these 
days??)

THe  latest news from Atari raises the prospect of a  1992  launch 
for  no less than FOUR new ST models,  described as phenomonal  or 
'wow'  machines by no less than Sam Tramiel,  which cater for both 
entertainment and serious uses..

Also,  that  Transputer board (STT) discussed in issue four,  IS a 
reality, it seems, and will be launched at the end of the year for 
attachment to Mega-STE's...

1.  We've got a special one in this category too, our dear friends 
OCEAN  SOFTWARE have apparently laid-off nearly a third  of  their 
staff,  is it the recession,  or else,  as we have long suspected, 
that  most  of  their games are programmed by the tea  boy,  or  a 
trained  Rottweiler...  Their  latest  releases certainly  do  not 
inspire the thought that skill and craftsmanship have reared their 
ugly heads in the Ocean 'Hit Factory'...

2.  I  think  Mike  has already given POWER COMPUTING  a  "Special 
mention" in the previous issue for their oh-so wonderful  ULTIMATE 
RIPPER cartridge...

3.  STAMPEDE is still dead (unlike Elvis Presley,  there have been 
no new 'Sightings' by the World Society for Braindeath...)

4. TCB TRACKER, I opened a new box of Cornflakes this morning, and 
guess what fell out into my dish!!
(And it now seems that Audio Sculpture is not going to be with  us 
until September, at the earliest - It needs a re-write apparently)

P.S.

Congratulations  to  Microdeal  for their  'Brave  and  'Different 
approach to computer music... (Who needs .MOD's ?!?!)

Let's keep this short, so it's bye bye from me, CIH (C) 24/6/91
