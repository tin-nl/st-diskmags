  
 Firstly, a little intro for a great guest writer who is active in 
the horror/slasher movie genre...

                     *****PETE LYNCH*****

He  is  also,  coincidentally,  an old school friend (?) of  mine, 
which  means  that I can get hold of selected  copyright  material 
from him, with the purpose of putting it in MAGGIE ('Raaayyyy!)

Here now,  are some reviews of recent film releases,  with more to 
follow  in  future  editions  of MAGGIE,  and  reports  on  horror 
conventions,  details  of 'uncut' films and videos too....

We'll  kick-off  with  a  report on the  SHOCK  AROUND  THE  CLOCK 
Horrorfest  which took place on the 11th-12th August 1990  at  the 
Electric Cinema,  Portobello road,  London, over a 24 hour period. 
This being number four.......

........  Getting  there in good time allowed the chance of a chat 
with  the  management  as well as the time to  hook  up  with  old 
friends,  veterans all.  Time also to purchase several fanzines on 
sale (reading matter for the early hours..) and share the  general 
amusement when a middle-aged gent tried to purchase a ticket having 
been  informed by some wag in the queue outside that it was  a  24 
hour hardcore porno movie festival..  Loaded up with junk food and 
cans of (soft) drink we awaited the off..

Roger Corman's FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND, a world premier, kicked off on 
the  right  note.  Cormans much awaited return to the  directorial 
chair  is taken from the Brian Aldiss Sci-fi novel and features  a 
time-travelling  scientist from the 23rd century  crossing  swords 
with  Victor  Frankenstein in the 18th.  A surprisingly  competant 
piece, solidly constructed, briskly paced and seasoned with humour 
and gore.  John Hurt and Raul Julia star. If the disturbing rumour 
that  Warner  want  to  release FRANKENSTEIN  UNBOUND  as  a  'PG' 
(Parental  guidance) are true,  considerable cuts can be expected. 
If not, it should get an '18' cert without too much trouble...

Kathryn  Bigelow's  BLUE STEEL (18) followed this.  I had  already 
seen  and enjoyed BLUE STEEL but found it paled rather  on  second 
viewing. The story has Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie cop haunted by 
Ron Silver's obsessive homicidal psychotic.  I found it all rather 
tedious,  despite  a  high violence quotient rather dull.  Capably 
acted, but Bigelow's sparse style of direction that served so well 
in NEAR DARK proves merely uninvolving here. I might also add that 
I   found  the  comparison  between  the  Silver   character   and 
HALLOWEEN's  Michael  Myers made by the usually  on-the-spot  Alan 
Jones somewhat fatuous.

Next  came  the retrospective feature,  CARNIVAL OF SOULS made  in 
1962, starring Candace Hilligoss and directed by Herk Harvey. Shot 
in  Black  &  white,  this is a long-winded tale of  a  woman  who 
survives a drowning against all the odds but finds herself out  of 
place in the world of the living. Actually, the film has some good 
moments  and  a  wonderfully  bleak  atmosphere.   The  acting  is 
laughable,  but  Harvey's direction is atmospheric and  involving. 
Incidentally,  Adrian  Lynes forthcoming JACOBS LADDER has a  very 
similar theme to its story..

Steve DeJarnatts simply wonderful MIRACLE MILE appeared next, I've 
already  spoken  of  this superb thriller  in  my  'Black  Sunday' 
coverage (Methinks I'll have to get this off Pete sometime -CIH..) 
but  let  me  reiterate  that  MIRACLE MILE  is  one  of  my  all-
timefavourites and an absolute must see..

A lengthy break followed here,  time to escape the oppressive heat 
(100  degree  F plus,  remember August??) inside the cinema and  a 
good excuse for a chinwag.

Clive 'Nightbreed' Barker floated about,  generally bemoaning 20th 
Century   Fox  for  what  he  considered  their  mistreatment   of 
NIGHTBREED  and  during conversation,  revealed his "If you  can't 
beat 'em,  join 'em.." intention to move to California.  Once news 
of  his presence got out he was besieged by hordes of  eager  fans 
and that was that.

Another talking-point was whether the Electric was an  improvement 
on  SHOCK's  old  home,  The Scala.  My input was a definite  yes, 
although stuffy,  pokey and hot, it proved rather less so, and had 
considerably more comfortable seating than the legendary Scala, if 
lacking the ambience and history of the former..

Returning   to  our  seats,   we  drew  breath  and  awaited   the 
continuation.  It  was not long forthcoming,  as Clive Barker took 
the  stage  to introduce NIGHTBREED.  Generally,  he spent several 
minutes  bemoaning  20th C' Fox and telling the  audience  what  a 
wonderful picture NIGHTBREED was. Those of us who had already seen 
it knew better though...

Starring   Craig  Sheffer,   Anne  Bobby  and  David   Cronenberg, 
NIGHTBREED  helmed  without  much idea by  Barker  is  a  mediocre 
monster  movie  in which an underground city of the  monstrous  is 
attacked  by  at least thirty normal human  beings.  Fractured  in 
narrative,  lacking  in  plot and overdosing on thick ear  action, 
NIGHTBRREED is terminally tedious,  mostly forgettable and notable 
only for a remarkably assured full acting debut by genius Canadian 
director  Davis  Cronenberg.  There is gore,  but this does not  a 
movie make..

Following  NIGHTBREED,  another break,  this time of over an hour. 
Time to get out and explore the locality in a frantic search for a 
decent  takeaway.  The lass behind the chip shop counter rated  as 
the  most  cheerful  person we had  encountered  yet,  whilst  the 
infuriated drunk ranked as the most amusing..

Hardly a chance to pass the time of day with the legendary Italian 
director  Dario  Argento  before  he  was  called  on  stage.  The 
reception that he got was heartening and certainly he was pleased. 
In halting english he thanked his fans and introduced his new film 
to  follow next.  Upon leaving the stage,  the unfortunate Argento 
was buttonholed by over half the audience,  rather like a cop at a 
Leeds  United  match  but  in a  much  friendlier  atmosphere  (No 
kicking, spitting etc..) It was some time before we saw him again.

TWO  EVIL EYES did eventually follow and although I had seen  this 
before  it had been in Italian so I was quite looking  forward  to 
it. An Edgar Allen Poe duology from two of the horror genre greats 
Dario  Argento  and George A.  Romero,  TWO EVIL EYES is a  worthy 
valentine.  Romero's segment comes first,  a relatively mainstream 
but relentlessly claustrophobic piece about a man who dies  whilst 
under  hypnosis  and thus remains in the realm of  the  not-quite-
dead. Adrienne Barbeau is superb in this and the wonderfully named 
Bingo  O'Malley  also  stars.  Argento's  segment  is  a  complete 
contrast  as  he rampages through a demented  adaptation  of  'The 
Black Cat' throwing in a host of secondary Poe references to  such 
works  as  'The House of Usher' and 'The Pit  and  the  Pendulum'. 
Whilst Romero's direction is ice cool, keeping all his directorial 
flourishes  to a minimum,  Argento displays his usual bravura  and 
penchant for flashy camera tricks. Recommended viewing...

Having  spoken  to director Richard Stanley and seen a  nifty  ten 
minute  promo  reel  on several occasions.  I  was  quite  looking 
forward to the next film HARDWARE. Boy, was I disappointed...

HARDWARE  is a tedious sci-fi actioner about  a  self-regenerating 
killer robot on the rampage.  Despite some graphic violence (which 
will  no  doubt  be cut from the UK version...) and  the  odd  few 
flashes  of  invention,  this  is mostly a triumph of  style  over 
content,  all red hued filters and pretentious camera tricks. Only 
William  Hootkins as a slimy pervert stands out,  and some of  his 
hilarious  dialogue will be 'lost' by the censor anyway.  A  major 
disappointment...

Peter  Jackson's  outrageous MEET THE FEEBLES was next.  Again,  I 
already  had  seen  this,  but it was no hardship to  sit  through 
again.  A  genuinly  demented parody of the muppet show and  other 
such  sickeningly sweet productions,  MEET THE FEEBLES goes behind 
the  scene.  Basically  graphic  sex  and  violence  with  puppets 
featuring  such characters as a drug-dealing sex-crazed walrus,  a 
porno-film  maker  rat,  a manic depressive elephant plagued by  a 
paternity  suite  slapped on him by a chicken,  a Vietnam  veteran 
frog,  a  paedophile fox and a host of other equally off the wall. 
Viciously  satirical and not particularly easy to take,  MEET  THE 
FEEBLES is one of the most deviant films I have ever seen and  one 
of the most amusing. Don't expect to see this in the UK, it has no 
chance of getting past the censor..

Rolkling  on  towards the end and somewhere amongst all  that  had 
gone  before,  a  15  minute promo reel for HIGHLANDER  II  -  THE 
QUICKENING  had  snuck in.  As I was not too fond of the  original 
this  did not fill me with any sense of anticipation,  nor did  it 
make a great deal of sense. As far as I can tell, it has something 
to   do   with  Christopher  Lambert  battling   a   multinational 
corporation  that  has control of a shield surrounding  the  Earth 
because  the  ozone layer has been destroyed.  Bluntly,  it  looks 
pretty  damn silly,  the only remotely promising aspect being  the 
presence of Michael Ironside.

Some  serious feelings of sleep deprivation began to assail me  at 
this point and something told me a kip was the answer.

Fortunately,  MANIAC  COP  II unspooled at this point and I  slept 
through  much  of it.  What I saw looked pretty naff,  but as  the 
original was fairly mundane,  this came as no great surprise.  The 
story  has the undead vengeful zombie cop turn up again (Like  the 
bad  penny..)  to kill some more,  and be killed once  again.  But 
don't bet on this being the final instalment. Rather disturbingly, 
this was directed by William Lustig who's MANIAC with joe  Spinell 
was one of the seminal works of the early '80s splatter boom.  The 
uncut  version of that film is a genuinly disturbing study of  the 
homicidal schizophrenic mind,  so the question begs, why is Lustig 
making such mainstream garbage as this??

Last  to unwind was LEATHERFACE:  THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III, 
Jeff Burrs second sequel to the landmark Tobe Hooper film.  Whilst 
Hooper's own THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE PART II was a very  black 
view of contemporary American Gothic through puke-coloured lenses, 
this  is a return to the opressive feel of the  original  cannibal 
clan. Derivative of Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES, CHAINSAW III 
is not a patch on number II and at times is rather dull. The print 
under  review  is  the full directors  cut,  not  the  bastardised 
version distributed in the states, cut for an 'R' rating and there 
is some gore. For the record, CHAINSAW III shares the fate of it's 
predecessor  and  has been refused a certificate  by  the  British 
Board  of Film Censors who are quoted as having branded  the  film 
"An Obscenity." Now if it had been made in Urdu?!?!

What the locals made of hordes of distinctly tired and dishevilled 
looking  horror genre fans invading their  neighbourhood,  unkempt 
but  high spirited early Sunday morning,  God only knows,  but the 
festival was a success,  went down well with the audience and I'll 
certainly be back next year...

        TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES....
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starring:- Judith Hoag, Elias Koteas, Josh Pais..

Director:- Steve Barron..

UK Release:- 30th Nov 1990, by MCEG/Virgin..

UK Rating probable '15' or '12' with cuts..


So now we get to see what all the fuss is about.  I must admit I'm 
often baffled by the curious taste of the mass American  audience, 
but this is really takes the cake.

TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES is to bluntly put it,  witless direct 
to  video  rental fodder,  and yet it has gone through  the  roof 
across  the Atlantic.  The anorexic plot has a bunch of of mutated 
humanoid  turtles  and a martial artist mutated rat  righting  all 
manner  of  wrongs from a lair in the city  sewers.  A  dim-witted 
juvenile  comedy,  though  I must concede that the film  is  quite 
watchable  and  the rat is actually quite  a  likeable  character, 
unlike  the  turtles themselves,  who reminded me of the  sort  of 
irritating  children I always seem to encounter  during  half-term 
visits  to the cinema - After half an hour,  I was rooting  firmly 
for the bad guys!

The  acting  in the film is simply dreadful,  not much  above  the 
rock-bottom standards encountered in porno-films,  however,  Steve 
Barron,  who made the amusing and underrated ELECTRIC DREAMS a few 
years back,  directs with precision and pace, injecting a sense of 
the  knowingly  absurd and the 90 minutes thus  zip  along  fairly 
painlessly.

Incidentally there isn't all that much in the way of martial  arts 
confrontation  in the film,  but the British Censor may still trim 
for the hell of it..

                         MANIAC COP II
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starring:-  Bruce  Campbell,  Laurene Landon,  Robert Davi,  Robert 
Z'Dar..

Director:- William Lustig..

UK Release:- Dec 1990/Jan 1991..

UK Rating:- '18'


In all honesty, I simply cannot find a single constructive comment 
to  make  about this,  no wait,  I lie!!  MANIAC COP II is an ideal 
cure for insomnia..

MANIAC COP was a pretty mediocre flick made a few years ago,  by a 
director who should know better. It dealt with an honest but heavy 
handed cop set up by wimpy superiors and incarcerated with some of 
the scum he put away. In double quick time he is seemingly killed, 
but  who is the renegade cop with a tendency to impose  the  death 
penalty for traffic violations? Yep folks, another run of the mill 
'policier' (as the french call 'em..) Gone and quickly  forgotten, 
but  now for no good reason,  this rancid sequel has darkened  our 
doorway..

Again  the rogue homicidal cop is on the rampage (forgive me if  I 
am a little vague here as I slept through part of the mid-section) 
and he is not too enamoured with his vanquishers of the  original. 
Campbell  (one of said vanquishers and a veteran of the EVIL  DEAD 
movies) is killed off early and Davi (so good in LICENCE TO  KILL, 
now  he  REALLY should have known better) has to kill  the  killer 
cop.

Plainly stated, this is unadulterated rubbish, ineptly acted video 
fodder.  Lustig,  who directed the remarkable MANIAC has no excuse 
and directs strictly by the numbers. Nuff said...

Also all the the above keyed-in by me, CIH as Pete does not have a 
computer,  not even an Amstrad PCW, but a manky typewriter, one of 
his  articles,  for a future MAGGIE is five pages long!!  I do not 
have the strength at this time to do that one!!!

TATA fer now  CIH 16/3/91
