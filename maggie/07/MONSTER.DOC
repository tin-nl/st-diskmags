At last, true stereo sound on an Atari ST!!!

A couple of years ago you wouldn't have thought it possible, but
now thanks to MPH you can have true digital stereo sound blasting
from your ST!

The Unit comprises of the cartridge, which plugs into the printer
port of your ST. Emiting from the back of the cartridge are three
leads, one to the monitor port and two jacks to be pluged into
the back of your hi-fi. On top of the cartridge there is a three-
way switch for various sound output which I will now explain...


        Position one    :   This position is the best position
         		    to play SAMPLES. It will allow you
    			    to output SAMPLES through both speakers
 			    of your hi-fi, or it will play 2
			    channels of tracker music.

	Position two    :   This is the most important and 
			    versatile position of the Monster Stereo
			    Cartridge. This position will output
			    TRACKER music in STEREO and play Amiga
			    SAMPLES in STEREO. It will also output
			    chip music through the right speaker.

	Position three  :   This is the best position for chip
			    music. It will output CHIP music through
			    both speakers, play samples or output
			    2 channels of TRACKER music.

I music say that after extensive use this cartridge has got to be
the best of it's kind on the market. Sampled sound is output
at true 8-bit compared to the normal output of the ST which is
3-bit. This means that a crap sample sounds extremly good and a
brilliant sample sounds like a CD. All of Max Max's tunes are
brillint when amplified throught this cartridge!

TCB Tracker is amazing through this cartridge (even better with
headphones!).

You get replay routines and TCB Tracker modules on the disk supplied
to output samples and TCB Tracker modules in stereo from your
own assembler or basic programs!!

MPH are offering the Monster Stereo Cartridge + TCB Tracker for
only œ35 (well they were when I purchased mine.) and there is a
special version of tracker on the disk that make full use of
the cartridges capabilities.

There is also a PD program called Audio Sculpture that allows
you to play Amiga modules in Stereo through the cartridge!
