The Picture Ripper
==================

This little utility enables you to rip static screens, fonts and
sprites from any game or demo. You can change the palette of the
picture, change the number of bitplanes on the picture, the number
of superpo's or the resolution you want to display the picture in.
When you have finished just press 'F3' and you can save the picture
to disk in DEGAS format.

I did encounter a number of problems with this option. You cannot
save SPECTRUM 512 pictures to disk and the palette of the picture
changes if the demo or game is full screen or contains rasters!!

The Memory Ripper
=================

The Memory Ripper enables you to work directly on the memory of your
ST, you can check the contents of your programming addresses, the
state of your program and the content of the ST's memory in
general. You can copy party of memory from one place to another, 
search memory with the built in search string facility, print 
memory and save in source code or binary format!!

Disk utility
============

This is just a simple disk utility that allows you to format a disk,
create a directory, rename files and print the free space on the disk.

External Call
=============

This option allows you to execute a program that has no GEM call's
(Windows, icons, pulldown menu's etc.).

External Loader
===============

This option allows you to load files or tracks off a disk at the
desired address. You can load several consecutive tracks at the 
desired address indicated by you!

The Music Ripper
================

When you go into the music ripper you are presented with a sub
menu. You can either search for music, save music or search for
sound samples.

If you want to search for music then press 'F1' and enter the
two memory addresses the computer will do all the rest.

If the music you have searched for is of a weird file format
(such as music with digi-drums.) the it will only find 
it around 30% or not find it at all. If it has found a piece 
of music that it does recogzise then it will give you two 
addresses on screen, it will also ask you if you wish to 
play the music.

If you would like to save a piece of music to disk then select
'F2'. The computer will ask you if you would like to save the
music as a binary file (for calling from your own programs) or
as an executable file (for clicking on from the desktop). You
then have to enter two addreses and a filename and the music
is saved for you.

If you would like to save sampled sound then all you have to do
is press 'F3' and you are presented with a menu bar at the top
of the screen. First you need to enter the start and end address
of the part of memory you wish to play, do do this all you have
to do is press 'F1' (for start address) or 'F2' (for end address).

If the sound sample you hear is to fast or to slow just press
'F3' and the sample speed is changed. Press 'F4' to play the sample,
if the sound is interfered the press 'F6' to alter the "Sign" and
'F5' allows you to save the sample. 

There is also an option in the sample ripper for STE owners to
alter the bass and treble of the sound but as i do not have an
STE i couldn't try this out!

The Disk Ripper
===============

This option is just a sector editor. You can search part of a disk,
read the bootsector and do anything to edit a disk but the best 
option in this part of the cartridge is the ability to disassemble
the sectors to source code and save them to disk!

Informations
============

Just a list of credits!

Exit
====

You can exit with this option with the cartridge left on so all you
have to do is press reset to call the cartridge and the software
will re-appear!


There are a few other options built into the caretridge which are...

If you flick the switch and press F2 you get access to the 
Ultimate Ripper main menu without saving the overwritten ram.

If you want to go into trainer mode, just flick the switch press
'F7' and boot up your game when you have come to the point in the
game you want, press the ring indicator switch (which you have
to wire up to your RS232 (full intructions on how to do this
supplied!)) and you are presented with a menu bar. From here you
can search for infinite lives. To search for lives for example
you have to enter a search string of say 3 if you have 3 lives
then when the computer has searched for the first 3 it comes to
you can change that number to say 100 for 100 lives, however
it may not be the right number and your game may crash!!

For programmers if you flick the switch and press 'F9' you can
read content of address $30 at RESET and do a jump. This option
can be good for debugging a program.

Flick the switch and press 'F10' to boot with the cartridge on!

This cartridge is good but after some considerable use
i have found a number of bugs, such as it plays music
when you have found it and then when you save it to disk
as an executable file the music refuses to play, It bombs
out occasionally and some times totally locks up. But
Power have promised updates in the form of new software!
