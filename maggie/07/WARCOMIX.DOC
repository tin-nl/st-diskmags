                         OPERATION "OH SHIT"
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A Jungle Romance of piano wire and pink dangly bits....
 (By Colonel L. O'Madfiend OBE..)

 (Translated from the original gibberish by CIH..)

HAVING  LEARNT  NOTHING  from his  regrettable  first  foray  into 
fiction,  here  I am with a tale of a Leaky boatload of Australian 
Soap stars,  enough TNT to blow up the Imperial Japanese Navy, and 
a small tree recognition handbook.... NOW READ ON.....

It  was early 1942,  the darkest days of the Second World War,  it 
seemed that the Axis forces were unstoppable,  but already, in one 
isolated encampment in New Guinea, plans were afoot to reverse the 
Allies success deficit in the Pacific Theatre of operations, plans 
which required the bravest and toughest men available to carry out 
successfully...

"Well we haven't got any of those colonel,  we'll just have to use 
this bunch of Australian soapstars instead..."

"Thank you lieutenant,  the best thing about that is,  at least we 
can sacrifice them with a clear conscience and a good script.."

Colonel  Lionel  O'Madfiend had a problem,  ever since before  the 
war,  as  a young up and coming staff officer at GHQ,  he had held 
radical views on how to win the approaching war....  His superiors 
tolerance  with him finally disappeared one day when he  presented 
his plan "How to defeat the German Blitzkrieg Invasion of  Western 
Europe" to the astonished general staff..

The  traditional  approved  method was for  the  onrushing  German 
armies to shove the British Army into the sea, and whilst the rest 
of  Europe  went  down the toilet at  high  speed,  metaphorically 
speaking,  Britain  would  gain  a sort of moral  ascendency  from 
'Standing Alone' against the Nazi hordes. This they could do for a 
couple  of years or so,  until the Americans or someone could come 
along and help..

Colonel  O'Madfiend simply suggested that the combined British  and 
French armies should properly train and equip their armed  forces, 
so  that when the Blitzkrieg started "They could kick  the  panzer 
divisions bollocks into Lunar Orbit.."

Needless to say, Colonel O'Madfiend and his promising staff career 
parted company at that point........

There  followed  two sterile,  wasted years,  in the camel  corps, 
checking  that  the shape of camels bottoms  conformed  with  army 
regulations, then the posting to New Guinea to oversee the filming 
of Neighbours in the 'Cannibal massacre' of certain top "Actors"

Then came the Japanese attack on pearl Harbour.....

Defeat  fell upon defeat,  and it was the allies darkest hour (Get 
on  with it -ED.) But at this time,  the good colonel took it upon 
himself  to  transform the situation into one of  shining  victory 
(the fact that he failed miserably is neither here nor there..)

Col O'Madfiend was fortunate enough to accidentally receive a  TOP 
SECRET  intelligence report,  the sight of which spurred him  into 
action, it went something like this:-

                   T O P  -  S E C R E T

        (ULTRA Classification- Very restricted circulation)

 17th February 1942 - South East Asia and South Pacific Operations

"Tokyo-  Japanese  High  Command unveil  new  terror  weapon,  the 
KAROAKE  MACHINE,  which is expected to make its operational debut 
shortly  against  Allied forces in New Guinea,  successful use  of 
this  new  concept in warfare could pave the way  to  conquest  of 
Australia,  and  defeat  of  Allied forces in  India, the  Western 
Pacific and China..."

"Immediate pre-emptive action strongly advised..."

"Report  on  operational  use,  and technical details  of  KARAOKE 
MACHINE TO FOLLOW:-"

"Mitsubishi Bn77 Mk 1 Karaoke Machine, - a multi tape deck and Hi-
Fi system,  on which backing tracks for several thousand corny old 
dogs of songs are kept..."

"In a battlefield situation, opening strikes with choruses of 'Ten 
green   bottles'  sung  in  a  wobbly  off-key  fashion,   leading 
eventually to a massed tone deaf rendition of 'He did it my way'
can be expected."

"By  this time,  it will all be over for any opposing forces,  who 
will almost certainly have run off screaming, not even the bravest 
men are immune.."

                Lt. General Dogbolux..


At  that point,  the colonel's best chance of redeeming his ruined 
career loomed in front of him, he knew immediately what to do...

BUT before we go on, a few details of the principal actors of this 
farce:-

1.  Col.  L O'Madfiend,  already discussed at length,  so we won't 
here...

2.  Lieut. Algernon Chinstyker-Forbes, a stereotypical upper class 
twit  type person,  tried to get a water-polo team going,  but the 
ponies drowned. (OLD JOKE)

3.  Sgt.  'Jason Donovan' The clean-cut star of everything that is 
on the T.V.  and everything that appears on 'Wunnerful Radio 1' it 
seems,  famous for the 'Eunuchs version' of JOSEPH and the AMAZING 
TECHNICOLOUR DREAMCOAT....

(JUST WHAT THE HELL has 'Joseph and the etc etc' got going for  it 
anyway,  it  is  just a tired bunch of 1960's poseurs who  decided 
they liked loincloths so much,  they thought "Hey wow,  lets like, 
stop smoking this heavy shit for three minutes and write a musical 
with  loincloths  in  it!!" and the worst thing  about  the  whole 
sordid business is, NOBODY STOPPED THEM!!!)

4.  Sgt.  'Henry'  'Craig  Thingy' you know,  the one with the body 
that can be politely described as "A Condom stuffed with  walnuts" 
who wears a vest or 'Singlet' with a surface area equal to that of 
something sub-molecular, and a pair of surfing shorts..

5.  Corporal.  A.Einstein, the token interesting character in this 
story...

6.  Private.  "Stan" #1 to #8,  the rest of the cast, who are only 
given  lines such as "Die you yellow scum!" and "He left  my  best 
mate  out  there in the jungle!" but can be relied on to  do  this 
with some precision...  We are still stuck with the fact that they 
are Australian and can't act too well...

7.  Some  Japanese  people  who die quite well,  and are  in  fact 
distant cousins of the "Stunt Germans" who died in their  millions 
in such mega-epics as 'Where Eagles Dare' (Wakkk!)...

Joan Collins has kindly agreed not to appear in this story...

So..

    .........Back to the story.......

         ......THAT BRIEFING IN FULL......

The colonel gathered the men chosen for the mission...

"Can  anybody  tell me what they can see in front of  me??"  -  He 
said..

"Yes sir, a blackboard, with a drawing of what looks like a 'boat' 
thingy  and  a  map of the northern  coastline  of  New  Guinea.." 
replied the lieutenant..

"Thank  God  for that,  I thought I was seeing  elephants  wearing 
dinner jackets for a minute there...."

Anyway,  the  mission was stunning in its simplicity of  planning, 
the aim was to take a boat load of handpicked idiots through heavy 
Japanese defences, coastal guns, warships, aircraft, video re-runs 
of  the  1988  Embassy world Snooker  Championship,  and  a  small 
cockroach  called Philip,  to where the Karaoke Machine was  being 
kept, prior to operational testing, and then to destroy it...

In  order to enable the commandos to pass unhindered  through  the 
enemy  lines,  the following "Brilliant" cover was devised by  the 
colonel.....

....When  challenged  by the Japanese sentries,  they would  reply 
that  they  were not enemy commandos on a  sabotage  mission,  but 
instead  were  enemy commandos on a training  mission  only,  with 
particular reference to tree recognition,  and they were not going 
to blow anything up today...

At  this  point  Private  Einstein  spoke,   "Sir,   as  the  sole 
interesting character in the story,  may I point out a slight flaw 
in  this plan...  It seems that the handbook for tree  recognition 
only covers temperate and northern deciduous and coniferous trees, 
and  there are NO tropical plants in there,  any Jap sentry  worth 
his salt is going to rumble us straight away.."

"A  good  point there,  it is the smallest items of planning  that 
mean the difference between success and failure.." 

At  this  point a very loud groan came from one  of  the  'Stan's' 
which sounded something like "Oh Shit!!"

"Remarkable  perception for what is only a piece of human  scenery 
who is totally expendable, the name for this mission is...

    OPERATION 'OH SHIT'
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.....and  it will go down in the Annals of military  history  with 
other great battles such as Waterloo and the Somme.. remember this 
gentlemen.." the colonel was by now, in full flow...

"Are  you sure those weren't elephants in dinner jackets,  I think 
they are holding a charity fundraising dinner???"

AND WE LEAVE THIS FOR NOW:-

PART II, The thrilling conclusion NEXT ISSUE!!!!

-and  some  Rhinocerii  in Morning suits  discussing  'Post  Punk' 
culture (Probably)...
