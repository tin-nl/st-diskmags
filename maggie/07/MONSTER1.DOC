(Da Daaaa...)

This  is a quick look at the latest MPH venture,  and their  first 
hardware project, the Monster Stereo Cartridge...

The  Cartridge  is a small piece of hardware which consists  of  a 
socket for the printer port,  and a lead to the monitor port,  and 
two  other phono leads to connect to the hi-fi system.  On top  of 
the  cartridge  is  a small three-way switch,  which  selects  the 
appropriate output for the type of sound,  TCB Tracker, sample, or 
chip music.... 

The package thus consists of the cartridge,  a demo disc, and some 
very  brief instructions,  the demo is designed to demonstrate the 
wide range and versatility of the cartridge,  and consists firstly 
of  a  cackling  sample,   followed  by  soundchip  music  in  the 
traditional Mad Max vein, as the next part loads, which is a four-
channel  Tracker (Non-TCB) demo of AN Cool's Breakfast Club  Mix.. 
When this finishes,  it is on to the TCB Tracker part of the demo, 
which incidentally sounds very loud and clear...  (This demo is ok 
for the first couple of times, but was a killer when it was played 
all  the  time on the MPH stand at the recent 'Shopper  Show,  God 
alone knows what long-term damage was done to the MPH staff....)

At this point,  I went to a friends house, as he has a much better 
stereo setup than I do,  and there it has stayed ever since...  In 
addition  to  TCB  Tracker,   the  cartridge  is  expected  to  be 
compatible with the forthcoming Audio Sculpture tracker, and works 
with version 1.5 of Noisetracker. MPH were selling WINGS OF DEATH, 
a  Thalion  game  which  features a  mixed  sample  and  soundchip 
soundtrack,   and   which   can  drive  the  Cartridge...   I  was 
anticipating  the appearance of TCB Tracker 1.2 which is  expected 
to  offer improved sound quality via the cartridge,  but this  has 
yet to appear, so my review is somewhat shorter than I expected..

In any case, the cartridge provides output for any music generated 
on  the STFM to a stereo,  and a lot of future software will  have 
code specifically designed to output in stereo to the cartridge..

Conclusion:-  MPH  have another winner on their hands,  as  Nathan 
(the  friend  with the stereo,) who is not a fan of  TCB  Tracker, 
wants  one,  (He  has  got mine and won't let go of  it..)  It  is 
currently œ24.95, and bundled with TCB Tracker, comes in at a cool 
œ35.00...
