This  little piece is not a full report in the traditional  sense, 
that  being  taken  care of by our  beloved  editor  and  hardened 
holiday-taker   M.Schussler,   but  there  are  still  some  other 
incidents, bits of news etc, to "do".......

Firstly,  I  had a beautiful cold,  the sort of cold that produces 
gallons  of 'Exorcist' day-glo Green snot and mucus,  this came up 
the  night before my visit on Saturday,  so you can imagine I  was 
feeling  really  chuffed  to be sharing a  railway  carriage  with 
several   hundred  kamikaze  chain  smokers,   these  people  were 
obviously  enjoying themselves,  judging by the number of coughing 
fits  that  they had,  upon lighting-up,  three of them  virtually 
rolling around on the floor,  Ah! what fun, and you can't beat the 
great taste of Benson & Hedges and clogged sinuses!!!

Some more complaints now,  the show was at Alexandra Palace, which 
as  you know is one of the really bastard places in London to  get 
to,  as  coming  up  the  escalator at Kings  Cross  Station,  the 
assembled  multitudes were told of a 'Security alert' and  to  get 
thee  hence  from the station,  ASAP....  After that little bit of 
fun,  I  arrived at the Alexandra Palace station,  which is at the 
bottom  of  this rather large 'hill-type object'  the  Palace  bit 
being  at  the  top...   To  get  there  painlessly,  a  'Courtesy 
shuttlebus' was provided,  which promptly roared-off in a cloud of 
dust  as we approached it,  so rather than waiting three days  for 
the next one, it was 'walkies' time......

There  is nothing like a steep hill and a warm day to  remind  you 
how unfit you actually are, then you get in to the show itself...

It was a good show if you were interested in things like Commodore 
CDTV's  (on  sale for the first time...) or PC soundboards,  or  a 
'Complete  office  solution'  type PC,  but sod all  else  really, 
fortunately,  I soon found Michael and an interested crowd looking 
at  some  early  screens of the forthcoming  new  Lost  Boys  demo 
(XXName deletedXX) including a hilarious intro sequence  involving 
a  (XXNext  line  deletedXX) WELL you will find  out  when  it  is 
released soon........

Several  hours  passed,  the  main focus of attention  being,  the 
Riverdene  PDL,  the  MPH  stand,  the bit of floor allocated  for 
people to crash out on, and (of course..) the bar.... "Food" being 
provided  by  the  'Plastic Replica Pizza Co  PLC'  at  exorbitant 
prices....

Argonaut Software turned up,  in the form of an incognito Jez San, 
who stopped by to talk to us, I spoke to him whilst over at the ST 
Format  stand,  and  he had a few interesting things to say  about 
Atari  (Not over-complimentary...) and also that  the  forthcoming 
for  three years flight sim BIRDS OF PREY will be released on  the 
ST,  but  for  1 meg machines only,  and this is almost  certainly 
their last release for the ST. In spite of his view that the ST is 
'dying'  I  wish him well for the future,  as he came across as  a 
genuine  and naturally friendly person...  (Leave the money in the 
usual place please Jez..)

The  other  'event' was the "Battle of the Trackers",  in the  red 
corner,  Microdeal,  and  in  the blue corner,  the challenger MPH, 
there being a little friction as a result of leaflets produced  by 
each  side comparing their product favourably with the other..  By 
late Saturday,  it had reached the 'Friendly discussion' stage and 
I  was  left wondering if Sunday would lead to them  pelting  each 
other with unsold copies of their respective programs.... Possibly 
the  best  aggro since Clive Sinclair vs  Chris  Curry  (Cambridge 
1982ish) or perhaps not....

Still  on the subject of MPH,  I was advised of the possibility of 
something new and exciting on the hardware side for the ST  coming 
soon,  but more on that, when I am certain.. Also details of their 
most efficient soundtracker routines yet,  for the ST, again, more 
on  that at a later date.....  For now though,  the Monster Stereo 
Cartridge  was  being sold along with TCB  Tracker,  the  combined 
package being around œ35.00...

Overall, a poor show, the Winter show at Wembley was far superior, 
but made enjoyable by the people who turned up...  Some unanswered 
questions  still remain,  has MPH declared a Jihad on  Microdeal?? 
Who  fell  over first at the post-show pissup at the  Anglers  pub 
(Michaels  local) indeed, did anyone manage to get there  using  Mr 
Schussler's instructions ("Turn left at the wibbly bit and fall in 
the river.") Do fairies live at the bottom of the garden!!!??

A  final  word about the journey home,myself and  two  long-haired 
heavy  metal  freaks  whom  are  not  a  million  miles  from  the 
Teddington Atari scene shared a train with an interesting  couple, 
she might have been sixteen but we doubt it somehow....

 TATA again Chris H..
