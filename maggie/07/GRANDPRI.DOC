
          SUPER GRAND PRIX SIMULATOR (Ate my Hamster...)
        ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~

Yes its those DARLING Codemasters,  the one company who make OCEAN 
look  forward  thinking and innovative,  with yet another  in  the 
long-running 'simulator' series...

This  'simulator'  is a traditional overhead view racer,  as  made 
famous  by  SUPER SPRINT,  the difference is,  that this one is  a 
budget release, and features four different kinds of event...

There  are  straightforward events such as Formula One  and  500cc 
Motorbike races,  and also Dragsters,  and a novelty event,  which 
features everything from a Sinclair C5 to a Chieftan Tank...

To  be  fair  to this game,  the handling characteristics  of  the 
different classes have been reproduced,  Motorbikes are a dream to 
take  around a tightly curved track,  but the long Dragsters are a 
real bitch to handle.. There is a damage indicator which has to be 
watched carefully..

Up to four players,  two of which on the keyboard,  can be catered 
for, Graphics are entirely what you would expect from this kind of 
game,  with no surprises,  with a start-up and finishing screen as 
well..  Sound  is a reasonable C64ish tune,  and standard  clicks, 
bleeps, for spot FX...

To be fair to the 'Codies' this is not too bad a game,  especially 
for budget price,  but at the same time, I remember playing a game 
very  much  like  this on a friends Amstrad some  years  ago,  and 
nothing  has  changed  very  much here...  It  is  time  they  did 
something new...

RATINGS:- Without which a review is not complete (So I am told..)

GRAPHIX:-  72% - A selection of tracks from on overhead  viewpoint 
with  tiny  sprites  representing the racers,  no  innovations  or 
surprises here...

SONIX:- 69% - A reasonable C64 derived tune at the start, and (How 
many  more times can I say this???) STANDARD BORING  ST  soundchip 
spot FX...

PLAYABLITY:-  77%  -  A good interpretation of  the  SUPER  SPRINT 
theme...

OVERALL:- 75% - not the most exciting game in the world today, but 
perfectly okay for a cheap racer, on a rainy day.. This presumably 
gains with more than one player too...
