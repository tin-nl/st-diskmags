          (Gremlin forsakes their 'Funky Moped' image??)

This  one  comes  as a breath of fresh air,  as it is a  3D  solid 
polygon racing game which actually works properly....

The  game is endorsed by the Suzuki team,  and their help has been 
apparently   invaluable   in  getting  technical  data   for   the 
performance  of  the bikes,  and the features of the dozen  or  so 
racing circuits on which you play....

There  are  three  different racers,  starting  at  125cc  models, 
graduating  to 500cc monsters,  via 250cc bikes...  It is strongly 
recommended  that  you  start  on the 125cc bike,  as  it  is  (A) 
automatic  gears,  and  (B)  you will have a  chance  of  actually 
getting around the track on it......

Turning  to  graphics,  this is done in the now time-honoured  3-D 
solid  polygon  style,  there  being a track,  and other  features 
depicting   a  typical  stadium,   including  grandstands,   crash 
barriers,  bridges,  and  of  course,  other  riders..  The overall 
effect is fairly sparse but has the result of speeding things  up, 
so the players progress down the track is fast and fluid and gives 
a good impression of speed...

There  are  a  number  of  control  options,   the  one  which  is 
recommended  is the mouse,  as this is a very fast game involving 
some  quite  vicious cornering that the joystick is not  quite  up 
to.  Leaving  the  track leads to damage (a percentage  indicator) 
being incurred,  if you crash fatally,  the (in)glorious moment is 
replayed for your delectation and pleasure...

Sound  is  represented by a nice sample on the title  screen,  and 
some very basic sound effects (That seem to have appeared in every 
ST racing game ever made..) for the game itself..

There are a number of nice little touches as well, you can load in 
additional  track  data from another disc,  for example,  you  can 
adjust  the frame rate for a faster/slower game,  and speed up the 
3-D graphics also,  by turning off the bike dashboard...  There is 
also  an  adjustable viewpoint/camera,  so it is possible to  race 
with a view looking upwards at the front wheel of your bike!  (Not 
recommended, as we did, and were somewhat hopeless as a result...)

And so......

GRAPHIX:- 79% - How shall we put it, there is only so much you can 
do,  with  current  resolution  and pallette limitations,  as  all 
racing games look the same after a while,  however, this is a good 
and fast 3-D system, which is very important...

SONIX:- 60% - Largely irrelevant to this kind of game. Fairly naff 
in this case....

PLAYABILITY:-  80% - This is a game which needs time  and  learned 
skills  to  master,  as it features some frighteningly  responsive 
controls,   once  these  are  used  to,   the  game  becomes  more 
interesting....

OVERALL:-  79% - A properly done program,  which avoids being slow 
and unmanageable,  definitely recommended to racing fans, although 
general appeal may be a bit limited after a while...
