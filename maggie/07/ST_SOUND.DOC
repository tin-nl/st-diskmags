             SORRY DAVID WHITTIKAR, YOUR TIME IS UP!

     Yamaha's 2149F chip was probably the worst piece of musical 
equipment they have made. It is basically very similar to the AY 
series of soundchip found in the spectrum and amstrad 8-bits. It 
gives the user three mono channels of tone or noise, and it's 
happiest when it's making beeping sounds.
     If there is one thing about the Amiga that ST owners admire 
(apart from its phenomanal amount of viruses!) its the brilliant 
four channel stereo soundchip. ST owners consider their soundchip 
'average' and the Amiga one 'excellent'. Amiga owners, on the 
other hand, think they have a very good soundchip, but would rate 
our chip as 'shite'.
     Why is there such a distinction between the soundchips? The 
casual observer would say that the Amiga chip is better as it has 
one more channel and it broadcasts in stereo. This, infact, isn't 
the main reason. The two real reasons are the Amiga chips' 
flexibility - its ability to easily imitate real instruments, and 
the other is its speed - it has its own custom chip and works at 
DMA speed using very little processor time.
     The YM2149F isn't has no co-processors and certainly isn't 
DMA. This presents little problem when making beepy tunes as used 
in Ocean's games, but to sound decent a tune has to use samples 
which take up memory, and more importantly, processor time. The 
higher quality the samples, the more memory and processor time 
used. As the STFM lacks hardware scroll and hardware sprites, to 
get a game running smoothly and at a reasonable speed is hard 
enough. To add a sampled tune over this is virtually impossible. 
This doesn't mean samples can't be used in other places.
     I remember the first game I bought which had a good sampled 
tune, Super Hang-On by activision. Forget playing the game, I 
just loaded up the first disk and listened to the music! 
Brilliant! And it been cleverly coded so it played while the game 
loaded. The problem came when you pressed space and went on to 
the next screens which featured awful soundchip tunes. Aaargh.
     As not much processor time is used in displaying loading 
pictures, menu/options screen etc., this is when sampled tunes 
can and should be used. A game which lacks a decent tune here 
probably lacks a lot more.
     But what utilities can be used to create these tunes? We 
are fortunate to have so many. They include:

Quartet: Tricky to operate, uses a lot of processor time, but the 
         sound is crystal clear - 4 Channel 16Khz. Stereo on STE. 

TCB Tracker: Millions of functions, easy to use, uses very little 
CPU time, sound quality is tinny. 4 channel 10khz. Stereo on STE.

Noisetracker: Not so many functions as the above, but it is PD. 
            Can play all amiga modules. Sound quality is similar 
            to TCB tracker. 4 channel.                     

Coming soon we have the excellent SYNC tracker, no matter what An 
Cool says, this is the best tracker available on the ST. It can 
load Amiga, Noisetracker and TCB Tracker mods, you can sample 
with it if you have a cartridge, it displays modules as a musical 
score. Brilliant!

     Using these four packages, great tunes can be created for 
intro screens etc. If we want even better sound, three cartridges 
have recently been released:

MV16 - From UBiSOFT in frogland - oops, France - comes this very 
nice cartridge which slots into (surprisingly) the cartridge 
slot. There will be a music package available for it soon. It 
gives the user 16 channels of mono sound.

Playback Stereo - For use with quartet, this gives a four channel 
stereo soundchip. Suitable for use with quartet. Plugs into 
cartridge slot.

Monster Sound Card - From MPH. Also gives four channel stereo 
sound. This can be used in conjuncture with TCB tracker 1.2

     With all of these now on the market, it would seem 
reasonable to expect that we can now get good quality sound in 
games. Even if you haven't the hardware cartridges, the 
developers certainly have the software.
     A lot of good new software releases have good four channel 
intro tunes, e.g. Powermonger and Speedball 2. The difference 
between these games comes when you actually begin playing. The 
in-game sound in Powermonger are all excellent sampled sounds. 
The in-game sound in speedball 2 consists of dire beeps, 
Speedball 1 had better in-game sound!
     The TCB tracker uses very little CPU time, and can be easily 
used in-game. As many demos have showed us, it is possible to 
have four channel sound plus tuns happening on screen AND in the 
borders! I expect decent software houses to use this to produce 
in-game music.
     There is a compromise that can be come to. Games like 
Dungeon Master use occassional samples which really do enhance 
the atmosphere. Turrican's in-game music is a blend of beeps and 
a sampled drum track which works perfectly, but then what do you 
expect from Jochen Hippel.
     The ST has come in for a lot of unfair criticism for its 
soundchip. Most people blame Atari for including this chip when 
they were originally going to include a more expensive FM chip. 
They take some of the blame, but software developers take the 
rest of it - they have to learn to take into account the 
restrictions of the machine they are using. I beleive that now 
there is no excuse for a game to include nothing but chip based 
music. Turrican is good example of the game of the future - 4 
channel tunes on the intro screen and hi-score table (these 
screens also feature overscan!). The ingame music includes high 
quality drum samples - but the sprites move smoothly and quickly, 
the scrolling is almost identical to the Amiga version and there 
are over 40 colours on screen. I can see future products from 
this software house using 4 channel sampled music and having 
better specifications.
     This is basically a plea to all software developers. The ST 
soundchip can produce great music, and this should be taken 
advantage of. If an ST and Amiga version of a game are being 
produced simultaneously, theres no need for two musicians, just 
port the intro music over using Noisetracker. It's so simple, yet 
hardly any software houses do this!
     I would like to give a special mention to a group of coders 
who know how important sampled music is and have used it 
effectively in every one of their releases. They are the assembly 
line, coders of: Xenon 2, Helter Skelter, E-Motion, Vaxine, 
Exterminator, Pipemania. All these games feature good sound, even 
if it is just looped samples.
     One day Ocean and US Gold will feature stonking four channel 
tunes in all there games.....it is probably more likely that An 
Cool's feet will stop sweating continuosly. Ah well, we can all 
dream....
