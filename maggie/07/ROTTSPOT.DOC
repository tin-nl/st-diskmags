 CIH Proudly presents!!!  SON OF THE SEQUEL PART II, THE REVENGE
 OF ROTTSPOTT PART II...........................................
 ...............................................................

Terribly  sorry  about  the  stuff above,  you  might  think  it's 
militaristic  overkill,  but  SADDAM HUSSEIN gave his most  solemn 
promise not to invade me!!!!

Oh Shit,,,, I thought....

So I set to making sure that this article,  ROTTSPOTT II,  was the 
best protected in the whole Maggie,  ol' bastard features,  Saddam 
won't  get in through the front of THIS article,  NO SIR!  this is 
the  best  defended  ready-to-kick-ass article of  them  all,  the 
firepower alone involved in protecting this edition of ROTTSPOT is 
horrendous, aha here's one of my secret concealed Exocet sites....
 
   (Secret EXOCET site ('X' marks the spot..))   X

Well thanks a bunch guys!!  That WAS a secret site,  now everyone 
and his dog knows where it is now!!!

I've  just thought,  by the time this gets into Maggie 5,  the war 
will  probably  be over,  on second thoughts,  it might not be,  on 
current form.... Hmmmm...

(NB.  today's date is the 27/1/91,  about 10-11 days into the Gulf 
war..)

Anyway,  SADDAM  has more than enough on his plate in dealing with 
the current war, without attacking ROTTSPOTT as well... But I hear 
that  AN COOL has just finished reading about himself and  FLOSSIE 
THE SHEEP.........

Better get some more barbed wire in......

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

That  should keep things safe,  that's enough layered defences for 
now, so Hi There! and happy Scudbusting to our regular readers..

             ROTTSPOTT - The 'Official' Title Thingy              
        (The usual wibble, hopeless tips, etc by CHRIS H).....    
      ()))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))       
                                                                   

What is new for January,  Maggie 4 is out, we have a whole new war 
(see  above...)  but  generally this is  the  post-Xmas  extremely 
boring  time of year.  JANUARY,  and FEBRUARY are sponsored by the 
National  Dullness Society,  so it is up to us writing MAGGIE 5 to 
bring a bit of cheer, or die trying... UUUUuuuurrrggg.......

Firstly, something to cheer me up immensely, SYNC's AUDIO SCULTURE 
soundtracker,  the  details  of which were kindly provided on  the 
Maggie 4 intro, it seems that you cannot turn around without a new 
ST(e) soundtracker hitting you in the teeth, but this one promises 
to be the best yet,  a serious challenger to TCB Tracker.... I had 
a  look at the limited version on the Phalanx OVERDRIVE  demo  and 
liked  what  I saw,  this was before the level of STE support  was 
disclosed  (Up  to  50khz  output!!)  and  a  'modified'  STE   is 
apparently  capable  of delivering 16bit sound  output!!!!!!!!!  I 
fervently hope by 'Modified', they mean cheap and convenient, with 
that  and  32  samples in memory at once,  you  could  conceivably 
produce  something  to  rival  the stuff  in  the  'Top  40'  (Not 
difficult) using the STE alone!!!!!!!

Apparently,  there are many more options for manipulating samples,  
and  you  have  access  to  many  different  forms  of  outputting 
cartridge.  AUDIO  SCULPTURE  can read Amiga .MOD's,  Noisetracker 
files,  and  even  TCB  Tracker  files,  this  promises  to  be  a 
soundtracker to look out for... 

Talking  about  old  friends,  MPH are  progressing  with  further 
developments  of their successful TCB Tracker,  version 1.2 should 
be  out any time now,  with the bugs finally (hopefully!) removed, 
and  they  are  also  on  the  point  of  releasing  their  stereo 
outputting  cartridge  to  go with  the  tracker.  The  cartridge, 
previewed at the 16bit Fair offers,  not only stereo sound,  but a 
significant  improvement in playback quality,  and a reduction  by 
about 10% overall in ST CPU time used, MPH will be making Software 
houses  aware,  and  they should be able to develope  routines  to 
address the cartridge..

(Version 1.2 is in fact ready,  and should be out when it has been 
duplicated  - MPH advised me on the 28/1/91)......  Well actually, 
it  depends  on when A.N.Cool can spare the  time  from  drinking, 
casual  sex,  and missing lectures (aka "University"..) as to when 
we can expect to see version 1.2, but the cartridge is due anytime 
soon (11/3/91 - The latest position,  honest..) TCB TRACKER is now 
down  to œ25.00,  firstly seen at the 16Bit Fair,  and now the new 
retail  price,  a  good move by MPH..  (It is now even lower than 
that,  down to œ15!!! I suppose by the time I have SAVED this file 
it will be public domain????) (22/3/91)

Microdeal (Remember them??) have finally got their STE  compatible 
version of QUARTET ready (Maybe I should do a regular SOUNDTRACKER 
NEWS  column  ?!?!) - QUARTET 1.5,  features STE support,  and  an 
(optional)  stereo cartridge for all the other ST's as  well,  for 
existing users to upgrade costs œ3 to œ6, depending on whether you 
want  bog-standard  single  sided or super  de-luxe  double  sided 
disks.  This seems very fair to me,  and a review can therefore be 
expected sometime in the near future, (Don't forget to return your 
original disks..) The new price-point for this program is  œ25.00, 
for new users (Not Bad at all folks..)

Going  back to earlier in January,  I attended the 16Bit Fair,  at 
the (in)famous Novotel,  Hammersmith,  London......  This time,  a 
group  of  us travelled down,  myself,  STU BRAY (responsible  for 
CABAL  and FUTURE BASKETBALL reviews in Maggie 4...) NICK,  a Mac-
owning  friend of Stuart,  and Nicks Father-in-law (AMIGA)....Poor 
chap! 

We  went  down  in Stuart's company car  (Lick  slurp,  thank  you 
etc...) Fuelled by company petrol,  so travelling costs were zero, 
but  the first problem we had,  almost immediately,  a little game 
called - HUNT THE WATER.............

Very  simply  put,  the  'Water Fairy' failed  to  visit  Stuart's 
windscreen washer bottle overnight, and the road was just a little 
bit  wet  and filthy...  STU initially reasoned that once  on  the 
motorway, the spray from the road would be sufficient to clean his 
screen,  however after a couple of miles of not seeing the road in 
front, we pulled off at a likely garage, PETROL..... Fine!! OIL... 
Great!  COMPRESSED AIR.....  All there!!  CHOCCY BARS........ Lets 
get  some!!!!  WATER.......  Sorry we're getting some more in next 
Tuesday, how about a free lucky gonk instead????????

In  a  roaring fit of anger,  we hit the motorway,  waterless,  and 
the  road was fairly dry at that stage,  we decided to pull off at 
the next service station after passing a police motorcycle at some 
speed....  "What  police  motorbike,  I  didn't see him!!?!"  said 
Stuart.......  The  service station (all names deleted to  prevent 
libel  action..)  had  plenty  of water,  so  we  filled  up,  the 
computerised water dispenser announced in dulcet tones, "Your free 
water  is œ7.48,  please pay at the kiosk....." The resulting  mad 
flight  demolished three petrol pumps,  and I hear that the  Lucky 
Gonk stand at that service station has not been the same since.... 
(ONLY JOKING!!!) 

The  rest  of the journey was completed without incident,  as  the 
police  motorcyclist we passed by,  at high speed again decided he 
wouldn't bother chasing us. "What policeman. I didn't see him!!!"

The  next problem,  the perennial LONDON FAVOURITE,  was finding a 
place to leave the car, parking in 99.9% of London is illegal, and 
punishable by death,  so this limited our options a bit.. We found 
a  carpark that was only several miles away from the show,  so  we 
did quite well......

The other interesting city phenomonem was the appearance of KILLER 
BUSES, as a London Transport suicide mission attempted to demolish 
the  front-end  of a Mercedes,  are the London  Transport  drivers 
given their driving-test in Braille????

We  got into a packed show,  without any trouble,  and I separated 
from  the  others  to look for SAMMY JOE who  was  partnered  with 
BUDGIE UK on their stand, I eventually found him, tucked away in a 
corner of the second floor, with the SYNTAX TERROR and OVERLANDERS 
EUROPEAN demos playing, I also spoke to Caemy Martens of Budgie UK 
(Nice chap!) and met one of my fellow contributors to Maggie, Leon 
O'Reilly   (Whom I hope will be able to still write,  whilst he is 
in  hiding from AN COOL!!!) also spotted other LOST  BOYS  members 
SPAZ   (xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)  and  'Richard  Gere'  aka  MANIKIN   aka 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX....  (Real  names deleted to protect the unwary.... 
Anway,  I  think   Richard  Gere  looks very old,  sorry,  I  mean 
DISTINGUISHED!)

******************************************************************

Concerning  JAMES  POND  - the game,  it appears there  are  extra 
colours for the STE,  as I ran it on a friends STFM and was struck 
by the difference (fewer colours..) It appears I reviewed the  STE 
version  in Maggie 4 folks,  hence the high marks for the Graphix. 
(It still had the same sound though.....) This is interesting, and 
I will double-check in case it is just me hallucinating....

******************************************************************
* BACK TO THE SHOW........                                       *
******************************************************************

Got  your  ice  cream  and popcorn  in,  good......  Then  let  us 
continue...   The  rest  of  the  show  was  another  box-shifting 
convention  held  on behalf of the ST,  AMIGA,  and PC  Compatible 
world, although there were some Consoles, including SEGA MEGADRIVE 
and  the 'Arcade in the home' NEO-GEO machine..  (Nice machine  if 
you  have  more money than sense!!!) and,  fortunately  for  Nick, 
Apple Mac shareware as well.  The various P.D companies for the ST 
and the Commodore thing were there,  but there were some very good 
deals  for  things  like TCB Tracker at œ25.00 (by  MPH  who  were 
showing  their output cartridge at the show,  also keen prices for 
blank disks (25p a disk..) Special mention to Silica Shop who have 
gone  from  being  the highest priced at  these  shows,  to  being 
amongst the cheapest (a typical œ24.99 game reviewed elsewhere  in 
here  being  got for around œ14.00 - not bad!!)  Clearly,  a  good 
decision on their part, long may it continue....

The  show was generally 'cosy' IE:- Tightly packed,  and was  very 
busy  on the Saturday afternoon,  it was not such a major event as 
the  'Shopper'  in  December,  but had some good bargains  if  you 
looked  closely.  It was also the cheapest show I have been to  in 
the  past  year (under twenty quid...  no transport cost etc)  but 
there's plenty of time to make up for that in the new year!!!!

I  was  planning to stay for the evening,  but threats  of  storm, 
tempest,  hurricane etc, hitting these shores knocked that out and 
I went back with Stuart (I was also turned down for my BANKLOAN to 
travel on British Rail aka BRUTISH SNAIL.........)

Returning now, to a topic discussed in the first ROTTSPOT, the new 
Atari  'Super-console' which has apparently reached the  stage  of 
being shown to developers on a 'behind closed doors' basis at  the 
recent  CES show in the US,  it is still not clear what it's final 
specifications are,  what it is even called, and what implications 
are  there for the ST,  expect more news soon,  but at least it is 
known  the  machine  exists  now...  Not a sausage  on  the  other 
hardware topics at this time,  apart from the Mega-STE being given  
certain  launch  in  Europe....  (I told you  earlier,  absolutely 
nothing happens in January/February....)

I  am  currently  listening to J.M,Jarre  'Waiting  for  Cousteau' 
album,   a  deeply  disappointing  release,  but  it  is  o.k.  as 
background  music  whilst you are working...  But why Jean  Michel 
Jarre  would  wish  to wait for a  superannuated  deep  sea  diver 
remains  a mystery...  (My favourite J.M.J works are EQUINOXE  and 
ZOOLOOK..)

(Actually,  'Waiting  for  Cousteau' does have a couple of  decent 
tracks  if  you  listen  enough to it,  like  about  78  times  in 
succession....)

******************************************************************

It  is now the 2/02/91 and I've run out of 'Computery'  things  to 
write about for the moment and I'm not too keen to write at length 
about the Gulf War either,  apart from saying that the coverage on 
television  appears to have settled down to a saner level,  and we 
are  not  seeing so much 'analysis' of minute scraps of  the  hard 
information that is coming out of the area....

MOST DUBIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE WAR EFFORT...........

To a person at work who should remain anonymous.......
(Found on the noticeboard...)

(Night in Baghdad....)

Boom,boom,boom BOOM, boom,  Boom! boom,
boom, boom,boom,BOOM,boom boom boom boom!
BOOM,BOOM,BOOM,boom, boom, boom boom...
(etc, etc...)
(It wasn't my idea!! Honest!!)

......WEATHER AS AT 22.15 hrs on the 5/2/91,  effin' freezing, and 
they are promising some snow as well,  later in the week. (We have 
covered the WHOLE RANGE of weather conditions in just two  isssues 
of ROTTSPOTT have we not?? - From heatwave to Arctic, and probably 
back again in March!??!?!)

This brings me to my next topic,,,

 SOME USES FOR A CLAWHAMMER (How!!!)....

1.  I  have  this clawhammer around,  it is used to 'persuade' the 
reluctant and 'on-it's-last-legs' starter in my car to wake up  on 
these cold mornings, it just takes a couple of swift taps to unjam 
it.....

2. The obvious use, putting nails in walls, etc...

3.  The obvious use,  killing,  maiming people whom you don't like 
etc.

4. Getting arrested for carrying an offensive weapon, and spending 
some time in prison, etc....

5.  If you have a video-camcorder, you could remake the PINK FLOYD 
- THE WALL video,  or a really good horror/slasher movie (See item 
three, above....)

6.  If  you  have  a  weak battery,  a hefty  smiting  around  the 
terminals should 'jazz it up' temporarily (another car tip...)
(When  I say 'Hefty',  I don't mean break the thing of course,  as 
there is more sulphuric acid around  than is desirable,  use your 
commonsense and discretion....)

7.  Use it as a rather large and coarse toothpick. (Only ideal for 
people with few or no teeth..)

8. It can deal with any Amiga (3 million pieces In 3.5 seconds..)

9. This is getting silly, stop it at once (ED...)

10. Aw! but it was just getting interesting...

11. I don't care, just drop the subject, ok!?!?!?

It  is now the 9/2/91,  and we have had "Some snow" over the  past 
few days..  BIG DEAL!!  scream Swedish, German, French, Dutch, and 
other European readers, SO HAVE WE!!!! 

Yes but....

I  bet that your countries weren't as cocked-up and brought  to  a 
standstill  as ours!!!  With roads ungritted,  the old song 'Slip-
sliding away' being the theme tune for Friday as people  struggled 
to  work,  there was a great article in MAGGIE IV about  different 
varieties  of idiot drivers,  I am keenly awaiting the follow  up, 
but  there is one special idiot out there,  the SILLY OLD MENTALLY 
RETARDED  FOOL  in front of me who got perverse  pleasure  out  of 
skidding  out  of control at a speed of 5mph!!!  SEVERAL  TIMES!!! 
Giving  me  fifteen coronaries en route.....  I say,  if you can't 
drive on ice, don't bother!!! Unfortunately, some people did......

Still,  we  have moved on a few days to the 12/2/91,  and there is 
more snow,  but I am on holiday this week, HOORAY! - Another funny 
thing  is  the media interest in the current bad  weather,  as  it 
happened  in  the Southeast of the country,  and  particularly  in 
London!!  BRITISH  RAIL  (see below) are in all sorts of  trouble, 
annoying  people  who  go  to work through  their  usual  lack  of 
preparedness..

SCENE:- BOOTS the chemist... who sell medical stuff...

"Excuse  me,  I'm the station manager for British Rail Euston,  do 
you  have  20,000 'V'-shaped hot water bottles,  they're  for  our 
frozen points ,..."

"NO?!!?  Well  do you have 692 crates of RALGEX (deep heat  muscle 
relaxant ointment)"

"Oh well,  sod this, I'm off to the curry-house for 5000 tonnes of 
chicken Madras (very hot..)

You see the problem??

So, if you have to travel, take the following with you.. 

A few simple items,  such as,  a warm scarf,  pair of gloves,  hot 
flask  of  drink,  a  shovel,  a  full  set  of  distress  flares, 
satellite communications system,  a dining-room table, A CHANGE OF 
UNDERPANTS,  a  community  centre (if the boot in your car is  big 
enough..),  box of blank disks,  a videotape copy of Cilla Black's 
"Blind  Date"  (to burn to keep warm..),  fifteen miles  of  thick 
electric  cable......(for  self-strangulation if  it  gets  really 
hopeless...)(Or ask a friend to strangle you if one is handy..)

So  you  see,  a few 'simple' precautions now,  can save a lot  of 
trouble in the snow, later on....

.........It also helps if your car decides not to start at all  in 
the really bad weather, errrrrrmmmmmm..........




                   *******MUSICAL INTERLUDE******

 (Before I go on to my next big topic 'Lamers' why don't you  stop 
reading  for  a  minute and pump up the volume to  listen  to  the 
music,  I don't know who it's by at this time,  but it is bound to 
be  good,  maybe  it is LAP again,  or MAD MAX,  or if very lucky, 
COUNT ZERO....)




You can come out now, the snow has all gone (18/2/91)..
 THE NEXT TOPIC:-
                  WHY LAMERS? (All the time...)

Yes,  why  Lamers??  I  appreciate  there  are people who  get  on 
everbodies  tits  (Metaphorically speaking),  but has the  art  of 
insulting  people really been lost?  Are they also worth 'airtime' 
in  demos,  are  they indeed worth their own special  screens  and 
demos??

It  seems that 'Fuck the Lamer' demos is street warfare  by  other 
means,  if  we  are  talking  Europe-wide,  then it is  a  massive 
organisational  strain (unless your name is the UNITED  STATES  OF 
AMERICA...!)  to get it together with your hated enemy in  a  dark 
alleyway,  carrying  a  suitable  array of knives,  guns,  chains, 
pointed  sticks  etc,  so the next best method is DEATH BY  DEMO.. 
(Until they do their own 'Fuckings' of course..)

SO  WHAT  ARE YOU RAVING ON ABOUT,  WILL YOU TELL US IN THE  THIRD 
PARAGRAPH OR WHAT?? I hear you cry....

Nope....  This is the fourth para,  THE POINT IS,  can people be a 
little more,  well,  interesting and original, in their anti-lamer 
demos,  The  art  of Insults,,,  try some of the following,  CAMEL-
BREATH,    SHIT-FOR-BRAINS,FAILED   ABORTIONS,    FAILED   MEDICAL 
EXPERIMENTS,   CRYPTO-FASCISTS,   TURD  BURGLARS,  SADDAM  HUSSEIN 
LOOKALIKES, JASON DONOVAN FANS, SHANDYMEN, RUNNY ARSES, POX-RIDDEN 
COCKS, hardly Shakespeare, I agree, but try to go beyond the 'Mega 
and 'Giga Fuck stage,  which everyone and his pet stick-insect has 
done to death by now....

A  little knowledge of the 'crime' or the person concerned  helps, 
failing that,  a great imagination and massive powers of invention 
(and  a steel-hearted disregard of the LIBEL LAWS..) It  is  after 
all,  quality  which counts,  'Fucking' seventy-three times on one 
screen loses my interest quicker than a sub-atomic particle thingy 
trying  to get ahead of A.Einstein and his laws (.0000000007 of  a 
pico-second...) SO BE ORIGINAL GUYS (and GIRLS)

That's my moan of the month over with,  I know everybody will have 
their  own views,  and people should write in to tell us what they 
think of the art (or not) of Lamer demos....

 LAMERS ON T.V. SHOCK HORROR EXCLUSIVE!!!..........

Take  Tuesday  nights,  a big hard Geordie copper played by  Jimmy 
nail, SPENDER, the name of the program, a typical episode revolves 
around Jimmy stopping the local underworld by getting beaten to  a 
pulp  by  the hired thugs of the 'Mr Big' he is  after  tonight... 
(Yes, EVERY bloody episode...)

In  between  kickings,  our hero is seen giving an Apple  Mac  his 
worst  and meanest stare,  as it is refusing to work, it needs his 
seven year old daughter to demonstrate how the mouse is moved, and 
the button on top clicked, in order to do anything on the Mac...

Thank you! Seven year old daughter, perhaps they should put one in 
every box!!!

It gets better, as later on in the program, the Chief of police is 
annoyed  that certain 3.5 inch disks have left the police  station 
(against  regulations my dear...) SPENDER,  the human tree says he 
used  a  MODEM  (A blummin' miracle if he  couldn't  use  a  mouse 
earlier..) to get the information.....

     ..........Cut to the Boss furtively looking in his dictionary 
for  the  magic  word MODEM and what it means (It  really  is  too 
much!!)

After  that,  it  was  just  down to Jimmy to  catch  his  weekly 
stuffing at the hands of this weeks low-life, (Must have been some 
anti-lamer gang....) Brilliant writing,  BBC, I haven't laughed so 
much in SIMPLY AGES!!!

 YET MORE LAME T.V. PROGGIES......

HITCHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY,  Actually HHGTG is a rare Non-lame 
programme,   featuring  the  guide  itself,   the  first  notebook 
computer,  but  success gave Douglas Adams the money to get loadsa 
Apple Macs and become self-indulgent, and stop being funny..
(Frightening thought for the day, does that level of furious comic 
invention burn itself out??  Are you left with the dried-out husks 
of former greatness (Or DIRK GENTLY as it is otherwise known!?!?!)

Enough of that! back to TV Proggies...

TOMORROWS WORLD,  A BBC 1 technology demonstrator programme,  they 
had the first working Transputer in their studio,  but usually get 
experiments to fail in carefully controlled studio conditions, the 
presenters tend to remind you of the irritating geeks that  appear 
on THAT'S LIFE.....

NEIGHBOURS, (Nuff Said..)
NEIGHBOURS and it's ilk,  Home & Away,  Prisoner Cell Block H, are 
scripted and designed by an unexpanded ZX81 (1k ram) with a broken 
keyboard   and  dud  power  supply,   which  explains  just  about 
everything...

ALL 1950's and 1960's Sci-Fi films, T.V. series...

These  are KING and QUEEN Lamers,  in danger of making  NEIGHBOURS 
look  feasible  (see above.) I am referring firstly to  the  '50's 
movies of the "Invasion of the Robot-Bogie Monsters" where a  race 
of  ravening  people-who-wear-a-hat-with-rubber  tentacles  Invade 
1950's  small-town America in a cloud of dismal  special  effects, 
with  the sole intention of carrying off the local  beauty  queen, 
they are only stopped by the efforts of a twelve year old boy,  in 
conjunction  with Lassie The Wonderdog,  and later on in the  film 
Lassie the horribly deformed genetic mutation...

The  1960's  really saw Lameness scale new heights,  GODZILLA,  Dr 
Who, anything by Gerry Anderson (Thunderbirds etc), but especially 
STARTREK,  Kirk was in charge,  Spock was, logical, the guy in the 
red  jumper  in the landing party was... vapourised by  the  usual 
mysterious  alien  presence  on the usual  uncharted  planet,  the 
engines 'cannae stand it capt'n and the computers all had millions 
of flashing lights and diode thingys,  all with their own distinct 
bleeps  and warbles as well...  It is interesting to note that  in 
all  '60's sci-fi series,  the computers had hundreds of keys  and 
buttons,  but no means of visually displaying the information!!  A 
bit  of  a  cock-up on the logic front there Mr  Spock !!

I'm  not  going  to  let 'seventies  sci-fi  get  away  either,  I 
mentioned   DR  WHO  earlier,   the  seventies  editions  of  this 
programme,  had a unique line in space station and costume design, 
all  one-piece stretch lycra with spangly bits,  and Omigod!  some 
really  ghastly  flared  trouser  suits..  All  space  ships  were 
carefully  constructed from different-sized pieces  of  cardboard, 
and under a really heavy bombardment from hostile ink-pellets they 
shook like (they were made of cardboard..) And all the studio sets 
were built from discontinued bathroom furniture...  Not to mention 
all  those  horrible  adolescent po-faced gits  with  crap  Osmond 
family  hairstyles who had 'special powers' such as miming  really 
unconvincing  laser  blasts because they  couldn't  afford  proper 
special effects, let alone get off with any of the women.......

Aaaaahhhh, the good old days,,,, this has really gone on too long, 
I  think I'll leave lameness for the moment,  and return to it  in 
another ROTTSPOTT in the future....

THE GULF CONFLICT IS O-O-O-O-OVVVVERRRRR!!!!!!!  As of the 28/2/91 
(see 'Dead Celebrities' for more detailed bullshite),  and I think 
that  A.N.Cool should have calmed down by now,  so no more  barbed 
wire...

(Alright, just a little bit for old times sake..

Since  I  started writing this,  back in January,  the Gulf War is 
finished,  My  car  has acquired a new starter-motor  and  battery 
(About time too! I hear it cry..) and my articles for Maggie 5 are 
all but finished.....

Also,  Atari  have  acquired  some new ST's it seems,  ones  of  a 
portable notebook ilk, but I'll leave it to those fortunate people 
who  attended  the  CeBIT fair at Hannover  to  describe  in  more 
detail.

Thanks  to  all the people whom sent in intro  disks  for  Maggie, 
(None  of  them  for  the STE though...)  better  luck  next  time 
perhaps,  this brings me on to my final topic, the mysterious lack 
of information on the STE demo scene (such as it is). A quick word 
of explanation, Mike (Sammy Joe) has a fair bit of STE P.D. in his 
library,  but no description of what these are like. Mike does not 
have  an  STE  so  these items are copied,  passed  out,  but  not 
reviewed beforehand, WHICH IS WHERE I COME IN!!! 
COMING NEXT ISSUE:- Amongst the other wibble, my Colossal STE demo 
round-up,  all  the  info on these mysterious things  called  'STE 
Demos' (Please get the disks to me Mike!!!)

So...

Lets  call this one a day,  it is over 28kb long,  (Coo!) which is 
longer  than I intended,  so hhj^&%k from me (which is Martian for 
good-bye..)          (C) CIH Jan-Feb-March '91
