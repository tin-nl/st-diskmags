Well here we are again,,,

This is the first in what I hope should be a regular MAGGIE column 
for  that  very  nice machine,  the Atari STE..  This is really  a 
follow  on from my issue 4 review of the first  multi-screen  demo 
for the machine,  The DELERIOUS DEMO part III, which was the first 
significant release (and hopefully not the last..)

In  the  meantime,  there  has  built  up  a  backlog  of  largely 
undocumented and unreviewed (and mostly single screen) STE  demos, 
and  I hope to bring some short but useful reviews for as many  of 
these as I can get hold of...

For  now though,  here are two quick reviews of the TOMORROWS WORLD 
demo, and the ESION Soundtracker..

The  TOMORROWS  WORLD demo is a single screen  adaptation  of  the 
famous episode from the well known BBC T.V. science program, which 
featured  the first public broadcast (in conjunction with Radio  1 
FM..)  of 3-D stereo sound.  This technique involves  manipulating 
the  sound  from your Hi-Fi to give a 3-D effect very  similar  to 
quadrophonic sound,  IE.) The sensation that you are surrounded by 
the music you are listening to.. So far, very uncanny??

Well this sound phenomona can be yours for the price of œ1.50 from 
Jennix P.D.  (66 Abbey Road, Strood, Kent. ME2 3QB - That's enough 
free  plugging- ED).  The only requirements are an STE and a handy 
stereo system to plug it in to..

So  what  do you get?  The disk quickly loads to reveal  a  single 
static  screen  with the 'Tomorrows World'  Logo,  the  soundtrack 
consists of an orchestral arrangement of the theme tune,  which is 
contained on the disk as a sample file, not as a tracker .MOD..

You  really  need to have a stereo to appreciate  the  3-D  effect 
fully, but you can get a good idea from the output provided by the 
Phillips stereo monitor output, the sample loops of course...

Overall  a sparse demo,  but a good one to impress the  neighbours 
with,  especially  the  irritating one who does not think the  STE 
soundchip  will ever get properly supported,  get it strictly  for 
novelty value..

The  other  review is for the ESION Soundtracker,  a  Noisetracker 
type program specifically for the STE..

The version I got (again from Jennix PDL) was a pre-release program 
of a soon-to-be-released commercial program.  Many of the features 
were disabled (Or not programmed yet..) but there was enough there 
for it to function as a useable soundtracker.. 

The program itself resembles all the other noisetrackers on the PD 
circuit in form and function (The only notable individualists seem 
to  be the TCB and SYNC trackers??) The output is  routed  through 
the  STE's DMA chip,  and seems to be at the 12.5 khz  resolution, 
which is adequate,  if not sparkling (Like 25 or 50khz). The other 
notable  difference is that you can adjust the bass,  treble,  and 
left  and right channel volume levels.  Another nice touch was  an 
increased working area for where you inputted the notes...

It  will be interesting to see how the commercial release  version 
of this tracker will compare with the final finished SYNC  tracker 
(If that is released in anybodies lifetime...) I would  anticipate 
that  support for all the DMA khz modes will be given at the  very 
least..  And  probably  some sort of sample editor as  well.  (One 
other thing,  at least the disk handler works properly (reverts to 
GEM..) UNLIKE Noisetracker,  oh,  and you have a choice of English 
or  French keyboard layouts..) A good soundtracker for  œ1.50  for 
the STE, but await developments for the full-price release..

That is all for now,  but there should be some more STE despatches 
from the Planet Tharg (AKA Northampton..) soon....

CIH (C) 22/6/91-----

(It may interest you to look at just how GOOD your STE is at  this 
stereo  thang,  I  learnt  from this program that  the  left  hand 
channels are somewhat louder than those on the right, I hope it is 
down to the monitor output???) - Chris..
