    	Reviewed by -BOD- and -MIK- of The Teutonick Knights


This is an excellent demo by The Black Cats with a new idea on the 
Main Menu. Basically the main menu is a game. It includes graphics from 
Xenon II (it's a megablast) and has been adapted to the demo very
cleverly.  The Muzaxx which plays while you play the demo is by 
AN Cool and is taken from the "Tech Tron" demo.

Unfortunately there is a very bad bug which has proven to be a pain 
in the neck while playing the demo.  All of a sudden you will die 
and loose a life for no reason at all.  This can be very irritating 
if you are half way through the game and suddenly go back to the 
start becuase you have lost all your lives.

The good news about this demo is that we have reviewed every single 
demo in the demo itself.  There are twelve demo's altogether.

Name of Demo			Review
------------			------

Night Force			This demo includes 143 sprites 
				which are 15*13 in 3 colours.
				Night Force are a new French
				programming crew.

Big Scroll by Equinox		This demo has got controlable 
				balls and a small scroller

Border Demo by NPG		This works on Bods STFM but 
				was programmed for the STF

The Zero D Screen by TBC 	This demo has controlable 
				3D shaped with a scroller 
				and a great background screen

Multi Scroll Demo by Genesis    Muzaxx by Mad MAx and a pretty
				good scroller with reflections 
				at the bottom of the screen

The MCS Spot Demo		This demo has controlable Sinus 
				dots and a small scroller to go
				with it 

Four Voices			This demo fails to work on BOD's
				STfm so we couldn't write anything
				about it!
				
The Monochrom Demo by TBC	This demo has got a good 
				background screen with one of 
				AN Cools chip muzaxx (T'PAU 
				China In Your Hand)

The Clone Demo 			Takes you back to the Main Menu
				(Get it "Clone" !!...)

Mad Max 			I think this is one of the best 
				demos in the Yo Demo.  It has 56
				Mad Max tunes.  The tunes are 
				selected on the graphic equalizer 	
				using the mouse.  The demo has got
				a very good working graphic equlizer
				and a 3D spectrum analyser.  To exit
				the demo you take the mouse over the 
				power and press the button.  Here 
				are some recomended tunes -:
				1,2,3,6,8,14,22,23,25,29,30,31,32,33,
				34,35,36,37,38,44,46,48,49 and 52

Follow Me                       This demo is a conversion of a demo
				from the Amiga by Red Sector, converted
				by Checksum of Equinox.  All the
				graffix and sound were converted from
				the Amiga, it is virtually overscan
				(well upper and lower borders are
				missing!). The demo features a skeleton
				called 'Jonny' who asks you to follow
				him while beckoning at you with his
				finger.  The finger animation is
				very good.  There is also spectrum
				analysers in the upper border and
				a good scroller scrolling over them.

The LCD demo  			This is called FFFF8240 on the Main
				Menu and is basically pathetic.
				Consisting of a big sprite with a 
				small scroller and terrible rasters.

The Bono Bono Demo		This demo is by Bono (who else??).
				All it is, is a moving background
				with tracking sprites and a scroller.
				Sometimes it doesn't select this demo
				from the main menu (but who wants to
				see this anyway???).

The Reset Demo			This has to be the BEST demo on the
				disk, and the BEST reset demo of
				all time!!!  I won't say much more
				(you'll have to buy the demo to find
				out how good it really is!).
