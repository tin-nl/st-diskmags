     Here we are again with another issue of our magazine.  I  am 
quite pround to say that I (or should I rather say we) have  made 
it  so far.  A lot of people thought that we would never make  it 
this  far,  even I did not believe in it but as it seems we  have 
made it.   I want to explain to you some of the problems, some of 
the joy etc. we had producing this magazine for you. 

     As  this  is some sort of a jubileum I will now  start  with 
Maggie's history.  The idea lurked in the back of my mine  around 
the  time when we were working on the Mindbomb Demo,  to be  more 
precise it was around its release time,  June '89.  This was also 
around the time when ST NEWS announced their last issue.  Quit  a 
few actors happening at the same time made me realize that it  is 
about high time to get off my lazy backside.  In other words  the 
reasons for starting Maggie were, in no special order:

I.
When we were on the tips of finishing Mindbomb I realized that  I 
was  not  pleased with my position in the Lost  Boys  anymore.  I 
felt  dissatisfied  by only swapping and writing  scrolltexts  in 
demos  so  I throught of something that I  could  do  (preferably 
something  without programming) to contribute to the  Lost  Boys' 
fame.  First  I  thought  of  doing the PD  library  so  that  we 
(meaning  our group) would have some money to go to copy  parties 
and  similar conventions.  Soon I got bored with runnning the  Pd 
library  and remembered that other idea I had which was  slightly 
more creative: a magazine. 

II.
Another  reason which inpsired me to begin with Maggie  is,  ahh, 
I'd  better not mention it again,  it has something to do with  a 
certain Dutch disc magazine. Well, this magazine was finished and 
I  realized  that there would be no other  good  magazine  around 
unless  somebody  would do something about  it.  I,  for   myself 
decided to be this person to change the history of the Atari ST.
Now I will go to bed, the time is exactly 23.52 on the 29.6.91.

All the above was actually intended to go into issue 5 of  Maggie 
but due to disc space problems I decided to take this article out 
again.  This  issue  of Maggie is nowhere as good as any  of  the 
previous  issues.  This is due to the fact that I am  only  using 
left overs in this Issue.  Most of the articles were supposed  to 
go in issue 4 or 5.  As I want to be fair to the people who spend 
so much time coding the intros or writing articles. 

I'll now stop this article because I want to watch Wimbeldon,

                    Yours Micky
