Thanx for reading this to the end. Now the last and certainly the 
best interview of LTK.


NAME: LTK (Lame The King).

REAL NAME: Leif Tobias Kornstaedt and I'm happy with it.

AGE: 18 years, 24 weeks, 0 days, 2 hours, 27 minutes at time of 
writing.
I was born 28 years after Stauffenbergs bomb attempt on Hitler, or 18 
years and one day before the beginning of the Marseille CP.

SEX: Let's see ... ah, male.

HEIGHT: 5' 8" but still growing.

WEIGHT: Between 60kg (after I returned from Marseille) and 65kg (when 
I'm well-fed).

STATUS IN MYSTIC: In order of preference: musician, coder and 
(sometimes) graphist.

NORMAL STATE: In stress.

HAIR STYLE: Klein-Doofi (as my father calls it).

LOOKS: See hair style.

NATIONALITY: German, living in France (I go to the Deutsche Schule
Toulouse).

HABITS: Trip over some of the cables in my room (its just too small 
for me and my electronic gear).

FAVE SAYING: 'He who breaks a thing to find out what it is has left 
the path of wisdom' (Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, Book II, Chapter 
II).
This is very appropriate when I see somebody break into a demo.

CLOTHES: I like to wear only a minimum (I leave you to imagine the 
rest), but if I have to wear more, I like wide pullovers.

FAVE COLOR: The palette from $227 to $557.

MUSIC TASTES: I like classic and barock music over all, and I adore 
operas,of which I prefer Richard Wagner's. Apart from that, I like 
electronic music very much, if it is not too poorly done however 
(Gandalf for example is good). Anyway, film soundtracks please me as 
well (Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams).

FAVE SONG: The air of the Queen of the Night in Mozarts 'Zauberflîte'
(No. 14). My fave opera is the 'Ring des Nibelungen'-tetralogy by 
Wagner (totalling 15 hours of music).

WORST SONG: Nearly all by Claude Franáois, an ancient French star 
France still seems not to have forgotten (unfortunately).

HOBBIES: Computers, playing on my electric organ, role-playing games
(Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Second Edition), reading.

FAVE FOOD: Chocolate.

FAVE DRINK: Milk and Coke (but not at the same time). Have you ever 
tried to put coke into the microwave? Then you get the worst drink I 
can imagine.

FAVE GIRL: Yes, there are some ...

FAVE POSITION: Lying in the chair in front of my computer, deeply 
concentrating.

FAVE BOOKS: J. R. R. Tolkien's works, Douglas Adams' works, Goethe's
'Faust', Eco's 'The Name of the Rose'. Claus Brod's 
'Scheibenkleister', a book about floppy disks and other peripherals.

FAVE COMPUTER: Atari TT (although I haven't got one). But I also 
liked the ZX81 (my first computer), the ZX Spectrum (my second 
computer) the Oric Atmos (my third computer), the Sinclair QL (my 
fourth computer) and an IBM AT with 33MHz, 100Mb Hard Disk, 
Super-VGA, HD 5.25 and 3.5 inch drives, arithmetic coprocessor, cache 
memory, graphic tablet etc (my father's computer), and currently my 
ST. Of the capabilities, I prefer the IBM, but for programming an ST 
is better. This makes the TT an ideal choice, combining the 
advantages of both machines. (This is beginning to sound like an 
advertising).

FAVE TV PROG: I don't often watch TV, but I found 'Ushuaia - le 
magazine de l'exträme' very amusing when I saw it once.

WORST TV PROG: 'La roue de la fortune'. Can you imagine how many 
French families watch it while eating? It's unbearable ...

BEST FILMS: 'E. T.' (I watched it two days ago on video), 'Return to 
the Future' (I watched it yesterday on video) and many other cinema 
classics.

WORST FILM: '2001 Space Odyssey', because after having watched it 
three times I still don't get the end.

BEST NIGHT OUT: It was perhaps not the best, but one of the most 
interesting: the nights in Marseille at the Replicants/Next CP. It 
was very challenging because you could learn some good survival 
techniques - how to get food, find a safe place to sleep ...

BEST CONCERT: Some concerts where I have been playing organized by 
the music school 'Digital Music'.

FAVE GAME: 'Wings of Death' by Eclipse, I just can't stop playing it!

WORST GAME: I don't remember any (anyway I don't get many news), they 
do not survive long on my disks anyhow.

FAVE VIRUS: The virus printing 'ARRRRGGGHHHH ! ',27,'p DiskVirus 
',27,'q ' 'hat wieder zugeschlagen !",13,10,0 (because it's so 
inoffensive). A friend imported it directly from Germany. And of 
course all viruses on Amiga (he he he ...)

WORST THOUGHT: To be forced to practise sport (which is actually the 
case if I do not want 00/15  in p. e. in my ReifeprÅfungszeugnis this 
year
[i. e. the document you get when you finish the thirteenth school 
year at the Deutsche Schule Toulouse]).

BEST DEMO: Tex' L. S. D. Oh, you mean newer ones? Well, I suppose I 
prefer the Mindbomb Demo over the Cuddly Demos (but then again this 
may be the case because I have watched the Cuddly too often). But I 
did not like the Decade Demo. (I had to say this - it is an 
everlasting discussion between me and Mr SPIRIT).

FAVE DEMOCREW: Either TCB or TLB, I can't decide.


Ok freaks it's all for now. I hope you have already received our 
Mystic Music disk 1 which contains 3 LTK's musix.
We actually prepared a demo which may be finished in some months. (I 
don't know when!!). So wait and see...
We want contact with a lot of crews other the world. Please write us 
only for fun and demos (no swapping game). Here our adresse:
      MYSTIC

 31140 FONBEAUZARD

See Ya'
