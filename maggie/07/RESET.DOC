               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Firstly, this is a help text for those that program in 68000
assembly language and not bull like STOS.  So if you dont know
how to write in assembly then go away.  So that should have got
rid of most of the lamers out there, so its down to business....

  To start with you need to be in supervisor mode because we are
going to be writting directly to the vector tables.

  The ST has a longword check value in $426 to ensure that the
routine pointed to by the reset vector is an actual routine and
not just a corrupted vector address.  This check value can be set by...  
        move.l    #$31415926,$426

  Now to set the routine address is identical to screwing around with
the other vectors like the VBL for example and can be set by...
        move.l    #your_routine,$42a


So now we have the routine installed, but when it actually executes,
a few sytem setups have to made.  These will also work on the STE
(I know this 'cos I use one!).

your_routine

  As the ST places itself in 60Hz mode, some TVs cant cope with that
so it could be a good idea to force 50Hz. (50Hz is the standard value.)
This can be done by...
        move.b    #2,$ffff820a

  As a general rule, I always assume that the palette and screen have
been buggered up and so need to be set up.

  The first thing I do is copy my picture or screen data to the screen
address held in $44e.  ($44e holds the last physical screen address
set by the XBIOS functions.)

  To do the palette, I normally use the direct method but the XBIOS
function might work also, the direct method is as follows...
        movem.l    palette_data,d0-7
        movem.l    d0-7,$ffff8240

  Some people like to use the XBIOS functions to set the screen address
but once again I prefer the direct method...
        move.b    $44f,$ffff8201
        move.b    $450,$ffff8203


  If your routine has reached this point, you should be looking at a
screen display with the correct palette etc.  If all you want is this
screen displayed and have no other routines to do like animated sprites
etc. then add to the end of your routine...
.stop   bra.s    .stop

  Please note that it is NOT a good idea to insert RTS or RTE at the end
of your routine as it will only cause you problems.

  Well that about wraps up this tutorial, unfortunatly, animated sprites
are a whole new ball game and thus beyond the scope of this article,
but I might write something about them at a later date...

  So its bye for now and I hope to see you all in our new multi-screen
demo that will be released soon...
