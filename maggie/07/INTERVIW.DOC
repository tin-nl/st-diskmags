
	       AN INTERVIEW WITH - THE TEUTONICK KNIGHTS
	       =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Hi, this is an interview with a new demo crew called 
  THE TEUTONICK KNIGHTS.

  We are a three member coding crew, and the three members are...

        BOD   : GRAFIX, CODING AND P.R.
        SPITT : CODING
        MIK   : DOGSBODY!

  I suppose you're thinking, what a weird name!
  Yes?
  Well we were formerly known as Visual Images but we didn't like
  the name, so we decided to call ourselves something new but couldn't
  think of anything new, until one day we were studying for our
  exams when we saw the name 'TUTONIC KNIGHT' - We messed around with
  the spelling a bit and came up with 'THE TEUTONICK KNIGHTS'.

  If you see any PD Software with the name Visual Images on it you'll
  know it's by us!!!!!!

  Anyway, enough of this craptalk and on with the interview.....
