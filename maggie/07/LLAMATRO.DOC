Well what can I say??????  A game which is so off the wall, has to 
be written by Jeff "Mines a beastie, and no wafers please" Minter..

This  is  an  adaptation of an ancient  early  'eighties  coin-op, 
ROBOTRON where you are represented by a central stick-like figure, 
shooting  everything else on the screen which is  running  towards 
you.  Of course,  the Llamasoft version includes some very hellish 
variations on this theme....

JUST HOW MANY GAMES have rampaging T.V. sets, cannibal heads, coke 
cans,  playing  cards,  brains,  and  best of all a mandlebrot set 
which  screams  when  you  shoot  it  (It  is  a  really  stunning 
bloodcurdling sort of screech too..)

The  objective of the game barely bears thinking about either,  as 
you have to rescue various beasties,  and you are left in no doubt 
as  to  the strength of their affections for you..  There are  100 
levels  and  it starts to get tough from about 9  or  10  onwards, 
although  you can have either a friend  as a second player,  or  a 
computer-controlled droid which effectively doubles your firepower 
for you.

Graphically, there is not a huge amount to look at, the action all 
takes  place  on a single (black,  no background,) screen and  the 
sprites are in many varieties,  but small in size, and reminiscent 
of  an early C64 game,  however there is a large variety of these, 
with some good ones such as the mandlebrot thingy. There is also a 
certain  amount  of brain-splitting colour  cycling  and  strobing 
effects  (It  is  never too hard to spot a Llamasoft  game  is  it 
not??)

Where  this game really scores is in the sound dept,  with some of 
the best sampling seen in any 16 bit game.  There are no tunes, as 
such,  but  the  decision taken by Jeff to go for sampled  in-game 
sonix,  starting with DEFENDER II has really paid off... There are 
plenty, including what seem to be sampled sounds from the original 
coin-op, bleats, moo's and screams, tons of general weirdness, the 
best  sonix are to be found on the 1 Meg version of the game,  the 
520k version still manages to retain most of the samples, and does 
not lose out too much.. This helps the 'Atmosphere Thing' along no 
end...

This is a game to play with a good joystick,  and a (Clean pair of 
underpants) sharpened mind.  It starts deceptively easily, but you 
are soon fending off more aliens than there are Jehovas  Witnesses 
on this planet,  or any other. Features "WHATTHEFUCKWASTHAT" waves 
of hostile sprites and it gets very, very fast...

THUR RATINGGS:-

GRAPHIX:-  61% - Lets face it,  this is not the prettiest game  on 
the  ST  at the moment,  some sprites have character and  interest 
though..

SONIX:- 81% - Probably the best use of samples for in-game  sonix, 
certainly the wackiest..

PLAYABILITY:-  79% - Shoot everything on the screen - BEFORE  THEY 
GET YOO_OOOHH,  very fast paced after a little while, and there is 
enough variation to hold interest,  more frantic and slightly less 
'Tactical' than GRIDRUNNER..

OVERALL:- 77% - This is a typical "Brave and different"  LLamasoft 
release, hard to fault value-wise at only œ5.00 (so I won't..)

PS.  This  is  different from other Llamasoft releases,  as it has 
been  distributed through the PD libraries,  and even on the cover 
disk of ST FORMAT, as SHAREWARE.... The game is initially received 
free,  but  you are invited to pay a œ5.00 shareware fee direct to 
Llamasoft  if  you like,  and decide to keep the game...  For your 
troubles,  you receive a free copy of ANDES ATTACK, and some other 
bits 'n pieces including a newsletter detailing what J.M. is up to 
at the moment...

GO ON, make an ageing hippy's day...........

Actually,  I  got  ANDES ATTACK back,  and I have spent more  time 
playing this, than playtesting the rest of the stuff I am supposed 
to review, a very good, underrated game indeed...
