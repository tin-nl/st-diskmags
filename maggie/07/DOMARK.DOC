     HYDRA and SKULL and CROSBONES in the same review!!!!

It is amazing just how many dodgy games there are these days,  and 
in the case of Domark's latest releases,  it is a pity to see this 
trend continue...

In the case of HYDRA,  this is yet another Tengen coin-op licence, 
the  game resembles AFTERBURNER on water,  so you are  immediately 
into problems of long-term interest and lastability.. the scenario 
is  of a super hydrofoil driver who has three secret  missions  to 
complete  down  various waterways of the  world..  These  missions 
obviously come within the 'Very public' definition of 'Top Secret' 
as there are hundreds of irregular shaped blobs who are intent  on 
stopping you..

It is not all problems, as you  can return fire with blobs of your 
own, and pick up moneybag-shaped blobs for cash bonuses, and round 
green  blobs to top up your fuel supply..  As you have guessed,  a 
large  part  of  the  problem is down to  the  coarseness  of  the 
graphics,  which,  in  order  to keep the speed high,  ends up with 
large  pixels,  so  large,  that in some cases,  you are literally 
bumping into an object before you can identify what it is...

Music is by Johann Sebastian Soundchip,  and is no better or worse 
than normal..

Moving  onto the other member of this duopoly of  direness,  SKULL 
and CROSSBONES, this one is yet another Tengen coin-op conversion, 
and is a hack and slash across the Spanish Main,  your very poorly 
animated  pirate has to hack his way across the decks  of  various 
other  ships,  picking up bonuses as he goes..  This game would be 
better  if it were not for the weedy lame animation,  and one other 
very  big problem..  The screen scrolls right,  and upwards as you 
move,  unfortunately,  it does not go any other way, so it is very 
easy to 'Paint yourself into a corner' and end up not able to  get 
out,  at  which point you have to quit the game,  not very good at 
all......

These  two games are entirely typical of the worst that a  lot  of 
softcos  produce,  part  of the problem seems to be translating  a 
coin-op  game to the ST,  as stripped of its 256000 extra colours, 
there  is not usually a lot left of most coin-ops,  the rest of it 
is  down  to  plain lack of ability though,  on the  part  of  the 
programmer..

Domark  may  well  do better with their  next  releases,  the  3-D 
Construction Kit,  and RBI BASEBALL 2,  which look more promising, 
God knows, they need to!!!
