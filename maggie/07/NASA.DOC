                 BRIEF EINES BAYERN AN DIE NASA



Greet God,



I  write you,  because you must help me.  I have seen your  Space 
Shuttle in the television.  In color.  And so come me the idea to 
make holidays in the world-room. Alone. Without my crazy wife.


I  am the Kraxelhuber .  The King of Bavaria was  my  clock-clock 
grandfather.  I stand on a very bad foot with my wife. Always she 
shouts  with me,  She has a shrill voice like a circle  saw.  She 
lets no good hair at me.  She says I am a Schlapp-tail. She wants 
that I become BÅrgermeister.  But I want not be BÅrgermeister.  I 
have nothing at the hat with the political shit.  I want my Rush.
And so I want make holidays on the moon. Without my bad half. But 
I take my dog with me.  He is a boxer.  His name is Wurstl.  So I 
want book a flight in your next Space Shuttle. But please give me 
not a window place.  I would kotz you the rochet full,  because I 
am not swindle-free. And no standing place please ...


And  please do not tell my wife that I want go alone.  She has  a 
big Schroot-gun.  She would make a sieve from my ass.  I need not 
much comfort.  A nice double-room with bath and kloo and heating. 
And  windows  with look to the earth.  So I can look  through  my 
farglass and see my wife working on the potatoe field.  And I and 
my dos laugh us a branch (hÑhÑ).  We will kringel ourself  before 
laughing (hîhîhîhî)!


Is what loose on the moon?  Ineed worm weather and I hope the sun 
shines every day. This is very good for my frost-boils.





                                        With friendly Servus


                                              Xaver
