THis is the BITMAP BROS (TM) debut release under their independant 
label,  Renegade..  From the pre-release burble,  we are told that 
this  game is expected to pay its own bus fare when you are  going 
home from ye olde software shoppe,  have your babies,  bring about 
world peace, lend you its stash of girlie maggies etc....

Well it cannot do any of those things, so I am reviewing it purely 
on its strengths and failings as a computer game.... So there...

The plot (Must you..) goeth as follows,  the Gods on Mount Olympus 
are looking for a hero to get rid of the evil that has taken  over 
their  citidel,  the hero decides that the only worthy reward is a 
place amongst the gods....  A sharp intake of breath from Zeus and 
the  rest  of  the boys follows that announcement,  but  the  gods 
comfort  themselves  with the thought that failure and  death  are 
very likely and they will not have to make good their promise...

So to the game itself, which is a platform based arcade adventure, 
but what a difference a good graphics man makes!! In this case, we 
have  Mark Coleman to thank (He who did the business on  ZENON  II 
and is currerently doing MAGIC POCKETS..) Most of the  backgrounds 
have  that  'marbled effect characteristic of his style,  and  the 
sprites,  including the hero are large and well animated..  Moving 
towards  the top of a level,  you also get a colour graduated  sky 
which is very pleasing in the eye dept...

The  gameplay  consists of exploring the  platformed  levels,  and 
throwing  whatever  is to hand against the nasties  which  have  a 
nasty  habit  of  appearing  suddenly,   these  include  reptilian 
walkers,  winged  harpies,  hatchet  carrying  trolls,  and in one 
memorable sequence, there were statues of birds which then came to 
life and attacked the player!!

The  game includes a large puzzle solving and treasure  collecting 
element in it,  there are keys to be picked up, doors to open, and 
certain  objects to collect,  you are given hints on the way as to 
what to do next.. In the now time-honoured BITMAP tradition, there 
are  numerous powerups to collect,  which boost your rather  basic 
throwing  knife..  YES  there is a shop at the end of  the  level, 
where  you can purchase more add-ons..  The powerups are essential 
later  in  the  game,  as the beasties seem to  get  extra  armour 
plating sewn into their posteriors...

Most of the puzzles are logical and reasonable, the solutions fall 
into  step  as  you  progress  through  the  level,   and  in  all 
probability  there  are tons of hidden bonuses in out of  the  way 
places,  like  TURRICAN,  but these will have to wait for a future 
visit  by  me...  The other much touted feature of this game,  the 
variable 'nasties' intelligence level has not,  thus far presented 
any  problems,  but we will await developments here too..  You are 
also given the option of creating a backup for the second disk, as 
the  high score table,  passwords to higher levels etc,  are saved 
onto this....

I've  got  this  far into the review and have  not  mentioned  the 
eardrum  flattening  bits,  the intro sequence has a  rather  nice 
four-track tune by NATION 12 (Or what 'Bomb the Bass' Tim  Simenon 
did next..) which is having a separate life as a 'chart release'.. 
The  in-game stuff is confined to sound chip spot  effects,  which 
are slightly better than average..

RATINGS:-

GRAPHIX:- 93% - It is nice to see this sort of high quality  work, 
especially  on a platform game where a cult of mediocrity  is  the 
norm for the genre...

SONIX:- 85% - High marks mainly for the good tune by NATION 12  at 
the beginning, spot FX good for ST soundchip noises..

PLAYABILITY:- 87% - A good responsive game,  slightly qualified by 
the  fiddly  object  inventory  thingy,  and  the  slightly  dodgy 
positioning on the edges of platforms..

OVERALL:- 88% - Not quite the megagame we were told to expect, but 
a  very good and polished game,  one of the few good releases in a 
barren three or four months... Essential item for all Bitmap fans, 
and a worthy item in anyones software collection, I think..
