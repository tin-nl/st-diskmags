            ########  WRITTEN BY STEVE JARRETT 1-2-91  ########



   HELLO ALL YOU STOSSERS OUT THERE THIS ISSUE WE WILL BE  DEALING 
   WITH SCREEN$ AS A MEANS OF MOVING IMAGES AROUND THE SCREEN
   AND USING DATA STATEMENTS TO CONTROL THESE MOVEMENTS


   THE  FIRST  PART  OF THE CODE DEALS WITH  THE  NORMAL  SET  UP 
   ROUTINES AND ARE NOT OF ANY REAL INTEREST SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT
   LINE 130 THIS READS AS FOLLOWS

          130 A$=SCREEN$(10,0,0 TO 320,199)


    WELL THIS SETS UP THE STRING A$ AS A SCREEN$ NOTE THAT I USE 
    THE WHOLE OF SCREEN 10 AS THE SCREEN$ YOU COULD ALWAYS USE
    A SMALLER AREA AS BIG SPRITE ETC.  
    OK NEXT LINE OF INTREST IS 150 WHICH SET UP SCREEN 6 AS A
    SECOND LOGICAL SCREEN, THIS IS NEEDED FOR ANIMATION I.E.
    WE DRAW ON A LOGIC SCREEN  SWAP THIS SCREEN WITH THE PHYSICAL
    SCREEN THE OLD PHYSICAL SCREEN IS NOW THE LOGICAL SCREEN
    THIS HAS TO BE CLEARED AND ITS NOW READY TO BE REDRAWN
    THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT!

    NEXT WE ENTER THE MAIN LOOP 

         235 REPEAT
         240 READ Y : INC S : IF S>30 THEN RESTORE 1000 : S=0
         260 SCREEN$(LOGIC,0,Y-6)=A$
         270 SCREEN SWAP : WAIT VBL
         290 IF S=17 THEN SAMPLAY 1
         310 SCREEN COPY 11 TO LOGIC
         320 UNTIL INKEY$>""


    LINE 240 READS THE FIRST DATA STATEMENT WHICH IS 6 
    IT ALSO INCREASES S WHICH IS A STEP COUNT TO TELL WHEN ALL THE
    DATA IS USED UP AND IT THEN RESTORES THAT DATA AND SETS THE 
    COUNT TO ZERO
    LINE 260 PUTS A$ (THE IMAGE TO DISPLAY) ON THE LOGICAL SCREEN
    AT X0 Y(WHICH IS THE DATA STATEMENTS 6 )-6 IT IS ONLY SET TO 
    -6 BECAUSE I MESSED UP THE DATA STATEMENTS SLIGHTLY BUT ALL
    IT DOES IS SET Y TO ZERO 
    
    LINE 270 SWAPS THE LOGICAL SCREEN WITH THE PHYSICAL SCREEN AND
    WAITS FOR THE NEXT VERTICAL BLANK ( 50TH OF A SECOND)

    LINE 290 IS FOR THE SFX THIS MERELY PLAYS A SAMPLE IN TIME
    WITH THE BOUNCING OF THE IMAGE

    LINE 310 COPYS SCREEN 11 TO THE LOGICAL SCREEN TO TIDY UP 
    AFTER THE MOVE AND CLEAN THE OLD IMAGE FROM THE SCREEN 

    LINE 320 SENDS THE PRG TO THE START OF THE LOOP UNLESS
    A KEY HAS BEEN PRESSED
    
    ALL THATS LEFT TO DEAL WITH IS THE DATA STATEMENTS AT 1000


          1000 DATA 6,8,10,13,16,19,22,ETC


     THESE STATEMENTS ARE ACTUAL SCREEN ADDRESSES AND CAN BE 
     CHANGED TO ANYTHING THAT YOU REQUIRE I HAVE ONLY INCLUDED
     A SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA BUT IT COULD BE AS LARGE AS YOU LIKE
      
   
     WHEN YOU CLEAN THE OLD IMAGE FROM THE SCREEN AS IN LINE 310
     YOU COULD ALWAYS SCROLL THE BACKGROUND OR SIMILAR 


      
        WELL THATS ABOUT IT FROM ME THIS TIME IF YOU WISH TO
