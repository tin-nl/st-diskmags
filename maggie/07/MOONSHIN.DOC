YEEHAA! (Hack spit pp-tink!!) Its 'dem good 'ole boys who make the 
DUKES  OF  HAZZARD seem like a bunch of diet  cola  sipping  pansy 
lamers...

Car chases, incompetent and corrupt lawmen, moonshine, inbreeding, 
the  Klu Klux Klan,  all the things that make the southern part of 
the  good  old  U.S.  of 'A what it is,  are represented  in  this 
game..(Err, I don't think the last two are actually -ED)

You  are  in charge of two good ol' boys,  Ike and Billy-Joe  (NOT 
Sammy  Joe..) who are taking part in a race to get  the  moonshine 
(Get-pissed quick juice..) first,  to Tuckers Bar.. You don't only 
have  the  other racers to contend with,  but also the local  law-
enforcement in the deeply dubious form of Fat Sam the Sheriff, who 
will have the cuffs on you quicker 'n a rattler 'kin spit..

(Do I have to keep doing this 'Down home' crap!! YES!!! - ED..)

The  plot suitably disposed of,  you are left with another  racer, 
with  a  few plot twists,  which I will explain in  due  course... 
There  are several different courses,  which come on a second data 
disk,  all  of which twist and bend,  in a manner similar to games 
such  as  LOTUS  TURBO ESPRIT,  CONTINENTAL CIRCUS etc,  there  is 
plenty  of  off-road scenery provided,  and a fair bit of  on-road 
debris  to  avoid  as  well,  such  as  tumbleweed,  logs,  police 
barricades...

The  other racers can be overtaken in the normal manner.  or  just 
shoved off the road,  but too much of his,  and collision with the 
junk on the road will knacker your boozemobile and put you out  of 
the race..

In  addition  to all that,  there is a 'window'in the top  of  the 
screen with little bits of dialogue form the different characters, 
trouble is,  if you start to read this,  you tend to bump into the 
stuff described two paragraphs ago...

Successful  conclusion of a race means that Tucker  the  Moonshine 
Man pays you for your trouble, and you visit the shop for upgrades 
to  your jangled jalopy...  All items are available,  for a price, 
including new tyres,  engines,  superchargers,  and a set of furry 
dice!!  all  the time a 'witty' dialogue between the boys and  the 
shopkeeper is going on..

Graphically, much the same as all the other racers, and there is a 
very  nice  film-like intro sequence,  with distant shots  of  the 
valley,  accompanied  by soundchip music of a distinctly Country & 
Western variety....

RATINGS:-

GRAPHIX:-  76%  -  Nothing especially gripping  here,  up  to  the 
standard  for other racers,  and a nice intro sequence,  the track 
scrolls perhaps a little more unsteadily than some other games..

SONIX:- 65% - The usual ST soundchip noises forced into C&W  mode, 
I  think  they  could  have gone for some  samples  on  the  intro 
sequence, especially as this is a two disk game...

PLAYABILITY:-  78%  -  This holds up quite well,  no  problems  in 
handling or responsiveness...

OVERALL:-  77% - This is ok as a racer,  with a few extras  thrown 
in,  if  you  must  have  EVERY game of this  ilk,  then  get  it, 
otherwise it is down to good old individual preference...
