---------------------------------------------------------

After the previous article in Maggie 4.0 by ZCT of The Lower Level, I
decided to follow it up with some more information on certain particular
composers and their different storage formats.  I hope to be covering all
the current ST musicians, and detailing how to rip their music and use it
within your own 68000/GFA v3 programs.  Each article will have accompanying
source.  Seeing as Mad Max/Jochen Hippel music was covered by ZCT, I'll
leave his music to a much later date.  Look forward to the following
composers/formats:  Count Zero, Ben Daglish, Jas C. Brooke, Quartet,
TCB Tracker & the numerous Soundtracker formats.

This article was originally written for Maggie 5.0, but after I had finished
it, and before I made any backup copies of my hard-disk, the damn thing
decided to screw-up and left me without a hard-drive for over 4 weeks.  My
thanks for the initial help I received from Tim (Manikin) & Michael (Sammy)
but it turned out that a link-virus had wiped out all of the partition
information on Drive C: - this is especially ironic seeing as I am the
author of the 'Professional Virus Killer' !!!

Anyway, onwards with the proper article !!


First Steps in Music Ripping.
-----------------------------

You will need a decent disassembler.  The one I use is MonST by Hisoft,
but if you can't afford this, get hold of the Turbo Assembler which is
shareware, and the disassembler is called 'Bugaboo' !!  Talking of Turbo
Assembler, I've now got a full English translation of this speedy
assembler, as it's got a nice bundle of features I want to use, but all of
the source files are still written in techno-German !!!

Now get the program that contains the music that you want to rip out.
If you're a beginner at this stuff, I suggest that you get used to MonST
before you start, as I will be referring to functions of MonST throughout
this and future articles.  After I give a certain procedure to follow,
I will give the appropriate MonST command in brackets.  This of course will
be different if you use another disassembler (Raid, Easy Rider or Bugaboo).

Right, once you are in possession of the program (game or demo), load it
into MonST with the executable file option (Ctrl & L).

If the program file is packed (more than likely), then I suggest that you
learn how to unpack these files.  Some files can be unpacked by the program
that packed them in the first place (Automation/Pompey/JAM/JEK), but others,
such as the Ice & Fire packers do not (at least not in the versions I have).
The easy way to unpack these files is to search for 'TST.L (A0)' or
'JMP (A0)' commands - the address register used will differ slightly
for each packer.  Once you have found the first of these instructions
(which might not be straight away), set a breakpoint (Crtl & B) at this
command, and then run it (Ctrl & R).  Step through (Ctrl & Z) this command
and you should be in the relocation routine for this packed file.
There should now be a similar 'JMP (A0)' command in this relocation routine.
Set a breakpoint here also, and run until this breakpoint - unless you are
a masochist and want to single-step your way through a LARGE loop !!
Depending on how much data there is to relocate, there will be a slight
pause.  Now step through this jump command and you should be inside the
main unpacked program - which contains the music you want to rip out !!

Now after all this, I'll describe the music format for certain music
composers.  In each issue of Maggie (from 6.0 onwards), I will be
discussing the methods of ripping various music files by well known
and also the not-so well known composers.  Some of them are no longer
on the ST, but the majority of them are.  For example, I haven't heard of
Jas C. Brooke for a long while, and then I see that he wrote the IBM PC
versions of F-29 Retaliator !!!

I would also like to hear from fellow music-rippers out there and I would
especially like some assistance (eg. helping with similar articles as this)
with music by Sound Images (Pang, Viz etc.), Alistair Brimble (various
Codemasters games), Matt Furniss (Hill Street Blues) and other ST composers.
Alistair Brimbles' music routine is easy to hack out (eg. Fast Food), BUT
it uses the 'Soundtracker' format for it's data - does anyone have the
ability/know-how to use this routine with ANY other Soundtracker music ???

Right, on with the article.  The first composer under the microscope
is .....


                              David Whittaker
                              ---------------

I'll start off with David Whittaker, as he has written an astounding
amount of music for various games.  In the beginning he used a slightly
different music player, but in recent times his routine has become more
standardised, and therefore dead easy to find and rip out !!!  Using the
method below, I can guarantee that you (yes, YOU), will be able to rip
out David Whittaker music to the exact byte.  Of course, it will help
if you posess a reasonable amount of intelligence, a will to succeed,
and the ability to stay up all night with reams of paper at your feet
complete with mindless hex (not sex) addresses on !!

Accompanying this article, should be the following files:-

DAVID_W.S       -       68000 source
DAVID_W.GFA     -       GFA BASIC v3.5 source
DAN_DARE.INL    -       A David Whittaker music file

Before you continue, make sure that you have loaded in (and depacked)
the program that DEFINITELY contains some David Whittaker music.


Ripping the music
-----------------

Change the control window (TAB/Alt & 3) to the Memory window.  Now you are
going to search for the David Whittaker play routine.  Enable the
search routine (G), then select the longword search (L).  Enter the
longword '48E7FFFE', which is the instruction 'MOVEM.L D0-7/A0-6,-(A7)'.
If you find a copy of the above, then it COULD be the music routine,
although if the programmer of the game/demo is using a lot of routines
that quosh registers, then expect to find a lot of these 'preserve
registers' lines in the program/demo you're hacking.

The bit that makes David Whittaker play routine easy to find is that
it has such a bloody tidy 'front-end' so-to-speak !!  You will find that
there will be three of the above instructions set out as so.  In the
example below, I've used the address $40000 as an example, of course
this will be different in your disassembly.


$40000  MOVEM.L D0-D7/A0-A6,-(A7)  ;Music initialise routine, send D0
$40004  BSR $4017A                 ;here containing the tune number or
$40008  MOVEM.L (A7)+,D0-D7/A0-A6  ;F/X that you want to play.  Always
$4000C  RTS                        ;starts with 0 upto xx tune numbers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$4000E  MOVEM.L D0-D7/A0-A6,-(A7)  ;Music Player VBL routine.  Call this
$40012  BSR $40208                 ;address from your VBL routine to
$40016  MOVEM.L (A7)+,D0-D7/A0-A6  ;make the music run with your program.
$4001A  RTS                        ;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$4001C  MOVEM.L D0-D7/A0-A6,-(A7)  ;Music Off routine.  Call this when
$40020  BSR $404B8                 ;you want to stop the music playing.
$40024  MOVEM.L (A7)+,D0-D7/A0-A6  ;
$40028  RTS                        ;
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've explained what each routine does, so at least you know what to look
for when ripping David Whittaker music out of wherever !!  Sometimes you
will find the above routines used when D.W. is written some Quartet
music (which is just as easy to rip-out - but that's another article !!)
for the game, enter the full-screen mode (ALT & Z) on the memory window
and page down a wee bit, if you see the words 'Quartet Player Program by
Nik Pelling' etc., then you know that you are NOT looking at any chip
music routine.  This occurrence of a Quartet play-routine and chip
music will fool the Ultimate Ripper cartridge completely !!

Now, this is the fun bit - saving out his music files !!  Write down the
start address of the music routine (the first 'MOVEM.L' opcode), now go to
the memory window, and search for the word '4E71' which is what David
Whittaker uses to signal the end of his routine.  Write down this address+2
(eg. '4E71' found at $41CA0, write down $41CA2') on the same piece of paper.
Once you've done this bit of note-scribbling, you are ready to save off the
file.

The above method is 90% foolproof, and there will always be the odd 5%
of fools out there, and the other 5% will be through sheer coincidence that
a routine has a similar beginning to it and will probably crash.

The majority of David Whittaker music is very small in size, and it ranges
from 5K upto approximately 14K (Super Wonderboy).

Press (S) to save off a binary file.  Enter a filename first, and then at
the next prompt enter the two addresses that you scribbled down, seperated
by a comma.  Now quit MonST (CTRL C) and load up GenST.


The 68000 & GFA source files
----------------------------

Accompanying this article should be an example source file that you load
into GENST.  Change the filename at the 'music' label, to the music file
that you saved from MonST.  I will admit that my source code isn't as
nice as the one supplied with ZCT's article - but it works, so what the
hell !!!  The main reason for my sloppy assembler program, is because
I'm just a poor GFA programmer, who dabbles in 68000 now and then !!!

Now assemble it (Alt+Shift A) to memory.  Now press (Alt+Shift X) and you
should hear your YM1249 chip straining to make some audible strains that
sound like music.  Press any key to go back to GenST.

If you do not hear anything, then go back to the program via MonST, and
CHECK both the addresses that you wrote down.  Save out the file with
the re-checked addresses and if nothing happens, then give up this one 
and return to it at a later date.

Hopefully, the above didn't apply, and you heard some music emitting from
your ST/E/TT/Stacey !! Depending on what hertz rate you are running your
machine at (50/60/70 hz), the music will either sound OK, or like a demented
conductor in charge of the YM1249 !!  David Whittaker music WILL NOT run
at 60hz/70hz, without some sort of 68000 modication to your program that
will slow it down !!  Whatever needs doing is beyond me !!!

In my source file, you will need to alter two numbers.  These are clearly
labelled 'tune_no' & 'max_tune', which are self-explanatory.  Here is the
trial and error bit.  The value for 'max_tune' is set at 8 in my source
code.  So that if you assemble your hacked file with a value of 8 or more
the source code will NOT call the music.  What you have to do is increase
the value of 'tune_no' until you cause a crash !!!  Once you discover the
maximum limit of tunes for this particular file, set 'max_tune' to this
value.  The usual crash will be three bombs (save your source at this
point !!) or silence !!

Once everything is OK, save a copy of your first music rip to a blank disk
labelled 'My Music Rips Vol. 1', and go back to the beginning, but with
another program !!  Now increase your collection with lots and lots of
easy to rip David Whittaker music.

As for the GFA BASIC v3.5 source, this is just as easy to use.  Alter
the length of the INLINE statement 'music' to equal the file length of
your hacked file.  Load your file into this INLINE, and press SHIFT & F10
to test the music.  Alter the routine 'music_on(0)' to whatever tune number
you require (providing that tune exists!).  Whenever you want to switch the
music off, call 'music_off', and ALWAYS switch off the music when you
exit a program (either via your control, or an error).  I've included a
quit routine that can be tailored to your own programs needs.


Ripping with a cartridge
------------------------

Another point to make is that with a lot of todays programs being protected
to the hilt, it is easier to use a cartridge to get into the program.
Especially when you consider that a cartridge is unaffected by 99% of all
protection checks (except the Multiface which isn't too good !!).  I personally
recommend the Ultimate Ripper cartridge, which is being sold by Power
Computing.  Originally MPH were supposed to be selling it, but they were
overtaken by Power Computing who sell it for 39.95 (read Maggie 5.0 for
some updated information on the Ultimate Ripper).

With this cartridge, there is an option to rip out music from anywhere.
This ripper will find David Whittaker (and most Jochen Hippel) with ease.
This is because this cartridge has a specific (although not perfect)
music ripper function !!  Press 'F6', enter a start and end address to
search between, and if it finds anything like a music routine, it will
allow you to play it from within the cartridge, or save out the file to
disk.  When ripping David Whittaker music, this music ripper will do it
the byte.  It follows the same method that I've outlined above, only that
the cartridge can be fooled by David Whittakers Quartet play-routine, as
it looks extremely similar (to the cartridge anyway).

A note to the authors of this cartridge:-  WILL YOU REPLACE THE IDIOSYNCRATIC
INPUT ROUTINE WITH A DECENT ONE !!!

If the information is correct as per the last issue of Maggie, concerning
the Ulimate Ripper, can anyone in the know please let me know when the
update/new & improved version will be ready ???

On that note, I bid you farewell until the next article.  I hope you
gain some useful knowledge from this article.  May I thank Sammy Joe for
all his help in starting me off on the road to music-ripping.

In the next article, I will be showing you how to rip another composers
music.  Future articles will feature Quartet music, Soundtracker music
and much, much more !!!

Till next time,
