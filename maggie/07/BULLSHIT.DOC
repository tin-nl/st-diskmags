Well, hello dear reader. I hope that you won't be too stupid to
read those some pages of pure bullshit, but if I'm writing this,
it's only because I don't think you have ever readen any scoller
where I'm talking. Yes, in my crew, I mean M.C.S, they always
release screens without asking me to write something, and I'm
angry about that ! So I decided here to write a scrolltext-like
article. Here we go...

Yeeaah, this is Gadget from the great M.C.S. from the great French
Alliance. Greetings to everybody, even the ones I don't know. The
fuckings are sent to all the other ones. Enough craptalk, lets warp.

That was just a joke, but that's the kind of bullshit you can read
when you are watching a demo on your favourite computer (The ones
who still think that Amiga is the best after the European Demos
have been released are real lamers...), I mean the Atari. So, I
decided a long time ago to do something quite nice for the mad guys
like me who can stay three hours watching the same screen because
they want to read the entire scrolltext. I collected the biggest
amount of scrolltexts I could have, ripping most of them, asking to
their authors, and here they are. I've not put many of them, but only
the biggest ones, and it's quite a lot. I first must thank very much
Yoda for having ripped the scrolltexts of the Cuddly-demos for me.

Since I don't think that it will be possible for the Lost Boys to
include an article of about 170 Kb, I won't include the scrolltexts,
but I'll soon release a demo which I call a scroll-compilation. But
I hope that some crews will send me the scrolltexts I asked as soon
as possible. That's all about my future demo, there will be many more
things indeed, but I won't tell you all... Hey, if you have written
a very long scrolltext in one of your demos, I mean 30 Kb minimum,
and if it's an interresting one, then send it to me. I'll give my
adress later on.

Now, I'd like to fuck one crew. I don't know this crew, but Axel F.
received a letter including a disk from this crew. On the disk, there
were some text files, about you guess what ? About selling cracked
games. An enourmous list (about 150 kb long) of cracked games that
they were selling. I wanted to hurt this group, so here is the entire
letter sent to us, but I've translated it in english (it was in french
on the disk). Err, I forgot to tell you the name of those fuckers, it's
"Bad Boys Belgium", and it's a well choosen name, since they are in
Belgium and they are real Bad boys, but I'd prefer to call them "Lamers
Belgium". Here we go. The following text IS NOT MINE, OK ? IT'S A LETTER
I RECEIVED FROM A LAME CREW, SO DON'T THINK I'M WITH THEM !!! When the
letter will be finished, I'll tell you... Here we go :


*************************************************************************


READ ENTIERLY THIS TEXT
	IT HAS BEEN MODIFIED
		THE PRICES ARE LOWER
			some NEW FORMULAS
First thank you for having written to us, let's meet, my name is *******
******** , LITTLE Guy in our crew.
  Our crew "BAD BOYS BELGIUM" is a link between the different crackers
from different european crews and you, atari ST users. We don't have the
pretention to "crack" but only to spread to you, who want a program.
  We receive the programs directly from the "cracking" crew, we also
have members of our crew in software houses, they don't want to be known,
this is the reason why we receive software very early and even before
their official release in different european shops.
  The programs are given for a price of 140 Belgium Francs including a
new DF disk or for 100 BF on one of YOUR disks.
  You may think it's expensive, but it's not even 10% of the value of
an original, also think that with your participation, we can buy more
and more original games to offer you more news.
  
	FORMULA TO SUSCRIBE FOR NEWS

  If you want to receive VERY quickly news (Only GAMES) you can suscribe
for 30 disks for 3400 Belgium Francs -new double sided disk INCLUDED.

	OUR PRICE INCLUDES POSTAL RATES

  If you prefer to send YOUR disks, we'll fill-in your disks for the
price of 2500 Francs.
CAUTION, make well your calculations :

	Is the price of your 30 disk plus the postal fees to send
them to us more expensive ? .....

  You'll receive each week from 5 to 7 titles. That assures you for
4 to 5 weeks. We'll inform you when there only will be 10 disks left
so that you can send us disks and/or money not to be privated of the
last news.

The subscription only concerns french arcade/adventure games.

We won't send the utilities, demos, compilations, as we only send
them title by title if you ask us.

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SUBSCRIBE FOR NEWS

You have to order at least 10 disks, that is an order of 1400 BFrs
or send your disks and 1000 BFrs.

This formula costs you 10 francs more per disk because of the postal
fees.

PLEASE help us by giving us the disk number as well as the title.

    NOW EVEN BETTER

       THE SOFT FOR 90 BFrs DISK INCLUDED POSTAL RATES INCLUDED

You only have to order us FROM OUR EXISTING LIST to fill 100 disks
That may be more than 100 titles, if for example there are 100
compilation disks you'll get between 250 and 300 games.

  Anyway if you order titles in 2 or 3 disks, you'll get less titles
BUT 100 DISKS.

 Send us 9000 BFrs (1500 French Francs) and you'll receive your
package 8 days after reception.

  HERE TOO GIVE US THE DISK NUMBER

       BEST WAYS FOR PAYING

FRENCH OR BELGIUM BILLS in 1 envelope with your order.
French friends, note that 100ff = 600 Bfrs

INTERNATIONAL POSTAL COUPON
caution we remember you to adress it to ***********.
It's also the SAFEST way.

EUROCHEQUE ONLY FOR BELGIUM

 Friendly all,
	LITTLE GUY
		ZX 81
		   ROUMOUSTACHE

CAUTION, we can't garantee at 100% that all the compilations titles
are ALL working.
It is due to different TOS ST STFM etc...
In average for 100 compiled titles, 95 are running and 5 are crashing

For those who only have 520 Kb of memory

  Tell us at each order, we'll try to test the game on a 520.
  If it's not mentionned, we'll suppose you have at least 1 Mb of memory.

Well, this is GADGET speaking again, I hope that my translation wasn't
too bad, I've done it very quickly. As you see, this crew is really a
lame crew (how many times did I say that since the beginning ?) and it's
quite a chance that I hadn't written the name of the guy, as well as his
adress, because I hate those guys. In fact I hate people selling games,
when they are cracked (but I like people selling original games !).
I won't writte the other files, but I read them and it seems that they
also sell midimix, and documentations of the games.

BUY ORIGINAL PROGRAMS, NOT CRACKED ONES :

Please, if you haven't any software because you just bought your Atari,
and that you don't know where to get some, PLEASE don't be fool by
writing to those lamers, and go in a computer shop to BUY ORIGINAL
games. It's worth the price because it's waranteed, you'll have a
documentation about the game, most boxes are nice, and sometimes there
are some gifts such as posters, ...

But don't buy shit. I know many people that have bought a game without
seeing it before, and they were quite disappointed when they saw it.
I think that it's a lost of money. So try to get informations about the
games available on the ST, some are old and really nice, some are new
but shitty. The ways to buy good games are numerous. First, you can
read some magazines (such as Maggie !) talking about games, but I
noticed that they say sometimes wrong things. The second way is to go
in a computer shop and ask the seller to show you the programs, but DO
NOT buy the games immediately after. You must take your time to buy
games, since it's expensive and it's better to loose one day than much
money ! Also, remember that the seller wants you to buy the game as
soon as possible, and he will try to make you believe that the game he
has loaded for you is the best. So ask him to try the game, and play
some minutes with it, it's the best way to see if it's really worth.
Another solution is to get a demo version of the game, you'll be able
to play one part of the game (one level most of the time) and it's not
illegal to have a demo version, since it's freeware stuff. I'm sure
that you can order some at TLB's PD library, the list is somewhere
else in the magazine. Other way, your friends have got a cracked
version of it and they copied it to you, so you don't want anymore to
buy it since you got it freely. But there are some things that you
must know, if you don't already know them. A game takes months and
months to develop, and the authors have to work very hard (I mean
with good games !). They aren't well paid during this time, sometimes
they even don't earn any money, and when the game is finished, they
get a percentage on the sold games. That means the more people will
buy games, the more the authors will earn money. So when a cracked
game is released, the sales fall down, and the authors won't earn
anymore money. And if it has beenreleased (cracked version) before
the official release, the programmers won't earn any money. They will
have spent a year of hard working for nothing. And that's not normal.
So BUY ORIGINAL GAMES !!!

The reason why I fucked so much this belgium crew is now clear for you,
but I did it for all the professional programmers I know in France, and
who are poor. Long time ago, I met the author of ZZ-COM, a great program
for the french network (minitel) on ST. He quitted school to program in
Gfa basic, then in assembler, and C. He made really great programs, but
he didn't earn much money with them... because of crackers. I also know
some other programmers, and many are in the same case. They have to put
an enormous copy-protection made by themselves if they want to get some
money, since the crackers will spend time on it. And I don't know if
you've tried to see into a program (such Explora), there are many little
messages written saying something like "Dear cracker, please wait some
weeks before cracking this game, otherwise I'll be ruined". It may seem
funny when you read that for the first time, but when you realize that
one hour spent cracking a game can ruin 6 months of work, you don't want
to continue, if you are a little bit comprehensive. Ok, I know that
many crackers will say that it's a kind of game to crack, and that's
true, but in that case don't spread the game once cracked. Nearly all
the crews that I know have cracked some programs, but many have stopped,
and if they continue, they only crack for themselves, without spreading.
For example, I cracked my original Flight Simulator II disk because the
protection wasn't working good and 9 times out of 10 my original disk
didn't work. And the cracked version worked perfectly, but I can affirm
that I've made not any copies of it to anyone. I'm thinking about stats,
and I bet you didn't know that a french game programmer earns less than
20 francs for each game sold 300 francs. And that is the highest rate.

That's all I wanted to write about this subject, and I think that I've
written long enough... I've got to get up for school in 5 hours (it's
already 1 AM !) but I'll continue the article in the evening... today
we're the 17 of january 1991, there are big problems in the Gulf, and
it seems that the war will start soon (I hope not, I really hope not).
This Saddam Hussein is also a real motherfucker, The only word than I
can say about the mess he spreaded all around the world is "SHIT".


Here I am again, one day later (in fact it's 10 PM of the same day !).
Well, my last sentences weren't wrong, but I didn't expect the war to
begin so soon... I stopped writing at exactly 1 AM, and I was going
to bed when I had the idea of listening radio. And at exactly 1:05 AM,
there was a news bulletin saying that the americans had dropped bombs
on Irak strategic points, and that the war had just started. I was
really about that, and I decided to switch on my TV and watch it. As
I expected, there were journalists talking about that, and I watched
television since 2:30 AM. Then I had to go to bed for the reason I've
mentioned just before (Yes, as a student, I've got to get up early !).

I don't want to develop my feelings about those facts, for at least
two reasons : You already know my taughts and I'm sure that you're
fed up with this, everybody is talking about it everywhere... So I'll
continue my article with another subject. In fact, I'm actually
trying to find something interesting to write because I don't want to
end the article here. The problem is that I'm really tired, but I'll
try...

Yep, I found what to say. I'm sure that you like the greetings. And
I've got many people to thank and to greet, so read carefully, you
may have your name in the list ! I'll also include some personal
messages, because I'm nearly sure that the concerned people will read
this list !

GREETINGS TO THE ONES I KNOW :

OUT OF FRANCE, FIRST...

- TCB : Tanis  :Hello, how do you do ? since the TCB Tracker, I've
          not seen any screens from your crew... Are you still
          spending all your time to create Thalion games ?).

- TVI : Captain Headcrash : Hey, the "Hachabound demo" disk you sent
          me isn't working perfectly... The main menu crashes !).
          Anyway, your work in the "European demos" is really good !

        X-Man : Hello, I like your graphixx in the "Hachabound demo".
          Well, I hope that I'll be able to send you our latest
          productions (on STE) because we've also got a really good
          graphist (but sincerly, I prefer your work, because it's
          more "worked")).

	Leonardo : Thanks for sending me back the disks, but as I said
          to Captain Heacrash, the "Hachabound demo still doesn't
          work, and you sent me back the damaged disk I sent you !).

	The other members I met at the Atari Messe.

- SAS : The Operator : Well, I hope that you're not too angry about me
          for not having written to you since a so long time... And we
          (MCS) agree to make a demo with you, but it sould be on STE.
          I also hope that you've now got a double-sided disk drive,
          because I hate to split double sided disks into single sided
          disks, it's too long to do !

- TLB : Sammy Joe : Well, first thank you very much for including my
          articles in your magazine. It's really a great mag, and I'm
          really impatient to get the next Maggie issue ! I hope that
          there will be plenty more issues !

	The other members I met at the Atari Messe.

- UNION : Well, I've got a message for Michael Raasch (which crew
           are you from ? I really don't know !) : first, have you
           received my disk ? , and then please answer me ! I really
           need what I asked you to send me. If you've lost my
           adress, then read it at the end of the article. Thanks !

	  Richard Karsmakers : Hello, I finally bought Fragonflight,
           and I think that the story on the book is very nice ! Hope
           to see you again !

          The other members of the Union : You're doing great games,
           and I really like the screens in the Syntax Terror demo.

          Delta Force : I like very much your Syntax Terror demo,
           but the two screens I found original were the two games.
           I'm fond with mindboggling games, and I've already spent a
           lot of time playing with both of them. The only problem is
           that my version of the demo can't save high scores !

- FOF : Well, I've got to write you one day, because the last letter
        I've received from you was nearly 8 months ago ! and I'll
        have some disks to send you too... You'll be interested !

IN FRANCE, THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE I KNOW (HOPEFULLY !!)

- TBC : Hey, Sharpman and Doc Prof, I've got some disks from you, I'll
        send them back to you as soon as possible. The YO demos are
        great !!!

- OVR : You should keep contact with us, since we're now coding on
        TT !!! The "European Demos" are really the best demo ever on
        the ST, and Ziggy is the best coder on ST in France, I should
        say "in world" !

	Hello to the guys I know in your crew, especially Stan Mercury.

- NEXT : Since Dbug II lives near my town (about 50 kms, in fact !) I
        send you greetings. I also have to write you, but I'll have
        to find spare time !

        Also greetings to all the other members I met at Dusseldorf and
        Paris (Salon micro).

- ST CNX : Well, that's a long time I've stopped writing you, Marlon,
        but I hope to see you again, you and your crew. You can
        tell Krazy Rex that I still think he does the best graphixx
        in France (at least !). Are you still coding your Dream Demo ?

- GENESIS : I met you in Paris, remember, but I'll have to write you !
        I really appreciate the screens you've done for the European
        demos, especially the rotating scroller.

- PENDRAGONS : As the other ones, I've stopped writing you long time
        ago, but I'm sure that I've got some of your disks, Crystar...
        So please get in touch with me because I don't remember how
        many I've got to give you back ! Hello to all other members !!

- U.F.O. : Hey, I hope you liked our demo party ! But I really don't
        like the "Anti Gadget" demo you made during it ! (thanks for
        not releasing it, but I'd like to get it... So funny !). For
        the ones who don't know, UFO members live 6 kilometers from
        my home, some members were in my school last year, and they
        are really cool guys !).

- the other guys on ST that I know and that I don't know for now !

- All people I know on Amiga (I'm anti Amiga, but you'll know why
        later!) especially Matrixx.

- The guys I know on PC (especially DJG), and on Macintosh (Loic).

WELL, I'LL HAVE TO END THE GREETINGS LIST HERE, EVEN IF I KNOW MANY
MORE PEOPLE... SORRY FOR THE ONES NOT MENTIONNED, DON'T THINK THAT
I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE LAMERS, BUT I'VE SURELY FORGOTTEN YOU !

Okay, that's it for the greeting list, I'm really tired now, and I'll
have to find another subject !!

I'm thinking that I promised to give my adress in this text, so :

                        M.C.S. (Gadget)
                   11, rue des grands bois
                             44880 SAUTRON
                                   FRANCE

Ok ? And since it's not included in a scrolltext, you'll have all the
time you want to get a maper and a pen to write it down. I know that
some people give their adress in scrolltexts so fast that nobody can
read it, and I'd like you to write me, but I won't answer :
- if you send me illegal stuff.
- if you're only a simple ST user (I mean playing games all the time !)
  unless you're really motivated to get in touch with us.
- if you send me more than 50 disks at the same time !
- if you're a lamer (if you don't know what is a lamer, you're a lamer,
  and you should read the Maggie #3 instead of writing to me !)

What else to say ?

         Nothing ??

   More bullshit ???

To make a long article, I can write down the sourcecode of our demo on
TT, but I won't ! No, I don't know. I've already written 412 lines of
text in only two days, and I think that's not a bad performance for me,
but I'd like to make a longer article ! The unpacked file takes a little
more than 20 Kbytes... Well, I must stop here, I'm sad because I've not
beatten Richard Karsmaker's scrolltexts this time, but I'm sure that
I'll make it one day !!
