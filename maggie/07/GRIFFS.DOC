                            PRESENTS
                       MY COLUMN (BY ME!)

     Hey! I'm me! That's good! Wow aren't I good! Oh, you're here 
now! Well isn't that good! This is my first column for Maggie and 
I hope it will contain humour,  humility,  anger, anguish,  grief 
and Griff.
     The first thing I must talk about is first  impressions,  as 
first impressions last (I read that on an advert on TV).  If  you 
want to impress your friends/boss/girls/pets etc.  you've got  to 
look  good.  How do you look good you ask?  Well to look  to  the 
future  we  must  first  look  to the  past  and  marvel  at  the 
philosophies of Charles Darwin.
     Charly boyo said that we evolved from monkeys. The evolution 
progress  is  ongoing and I believe it is circular  and  we  will 
revert back to our most primitive state eventually.  Thousands of 
years  ago  we were monkeys,  and in thousands of years  time  we 
shall be monkeys once again,  and we shall regress until we crawl 
back  into the sea and become amoeba - I think some of the  other 
members of the inner circle have already done this.
     People admire people with foresight.  Those who look to  the 
future and show what it will bring are heaped with respect.  Just 
look at Nostrodamus or John Kettley.       Ultimately you will be 
loved  if  you  are  futuristic.  That is why  I  now  sport  the 
futuristic  look,  the monkey look.  I also follow the  monkeyian 
philosophies - it's all quite simple.
     I  will  now teach all the dear Maggie readers how to  be  a 
monkey like me:
     First the haircut must be right - shortish basin style hair. 
Add a bit of chip-pan grease for that 'jungle style look'.
     Getting the face right is the most difficult bit,  follow my 
tip and run into a wall a few times, a simple trick but it really 
does work.
     Making perfect feet is painful,  but no pain, no gain. Stand 
a  few hundred yards from a bus stop on the edge of the kerb  and 
wait  for a bus (The dirty green ones are the best).  Stick  your 
feet   out  under  its  wheels  and  they  should  flatten   out. 
Alternatively get your sister to attack them with a rolling pin.
     The rest of the body should be treated to daily mudbaths.  I 
just  shovelled our flowerbeds into the pond to  make  one.  It's 
really  very easy.  A simple half an hour bathe will be  suitable 
for most.
     Never  wear  deodorants,  not even  natrel  plus.  They  are 
unnecessary and damage the environment.  Besides,  you smell like 
one  of  the assistants at Boots.  You should  develop  your  own 
particular smell which is not only unique but  flavoursome.  Here 
at  the inner circle,  our noses are so finely tuned that we  can 
tell  who  is  who just be sniffing  each  others  bottoms.  Some 
members get a little over excited at this activity though.
     All monkeys have pets. They're small, there's no need to buy 
food for them,  they don't bite the postman and you can pick them 
up  for free.  They are of course fleas,  and I keep mine  in  my 
armpits.
     Clothes wise I usually just wear grass skirts,  though  most 
of the local nightclubs don't admit me.  Picking up girls is easy 
though.  I  walk over to a couple and the boyfriend  always  runs 
away.  The girl faints leaving me to do as I please with  her.  I 
enjoy  painting  girl's  left  nipples with  my  range  of  mango 
flavoured paints. 
     Onto  computers  (And who isn't) I hope everyone  liked  our 
"DICKHEAD  DEMO".  The main sprite was to be a monkey but  people 
would  think  we'd copied Mindbomb,  and as everything  else  was 
copied we had to come up with something original.
     Some  of  the screens in the DICKHEAD demo would  be  a  lot 
faster if only Manikin would optimise his code more.  Now 'Life's 
a bitch' has been released we have got enough additional code  to 
release a new demo as soon as we've ripped some more fonts.
     The DICKHEAD demo would've been a total success if it wasn't 
for one man,  Count Zero.  We're considering throwing him out  of 
the Inner Circle,  he did too much original work.  He did tuns of 
tunes for the demo,  and they were all good!  He didn't even  rip 
one tune!  He stole a few mad max compositions and converted them 
to Quartet,  but this isn't good enough. When we hired a musician 
we expected someone who would write one spluttery beepy tune  and 
then rip Jochen Hippel music. But the prat starts writing his own 
stuff! Time waster!
     Apart  from  that  minor hiccup,  the Dickhead  demo  was  a 
success.  We  stole the ideas for the very first screen  and  the 
menu from the Union demo.  I took the parallax scroll screen from 
Mindbomb,  the  fingerbobs  stole a nice mad max tune  for  their 
screen  and  we  also ripped spaz's  megadeth  font  for  another 
screen.  Forget the fast 3D graphics on 'life's a bitch',  we had 
wireframe vectors and the slowest filled 3D ever seen on the  ST. 
We  also had the slowest packer and the most  boring  scrolltext. 
All we talked about is the Lost Boys,  as we'd nicked their  code 
and  GFX  we thought we should also nick  their  scrolltext.  The 
phantom  suggested using the Mindbomb demo and just  cutting  the 
bear  punching scene out and putting an inner circle  logo  there 
and  releasing  it.  I said someone may notice,  but he  said  he 
wouldn't have noticed if someone else had done it.      

     Now I want to talk about leisure software on the Atari ST.

Dungeon  Master - How boring.  If I wanted a game where you  just 
walked  through endless corridors I'd visit wormwood  scrubs.  Oh 
yeah, I already have.
Kick Off 2 - Call this a game? Where are the aliens?
Treasure Island Dizzy - This is too complicated for me,  I  think 
you need an IQ of 2000 to complete it!
Space Ace - This game really annoys me. When I first loaded it up 
I was so stunned by the graphics that I though I had a coin-op in 
my bedroom and started pushing 10ps in the disk drive and I broke 
the computer!
First  World  Plus - This is a brilliant game!  I spend  all  day 
typing 'FUCK' and hearing the computer beep at me.  It is just SO 
funny!  I  am  hoping to get a four player adaptor so  the  other 
members of the inner circle can play with me. If not, we can just 
have a bum in the corner.

     I have just received the new demo from the  Overlanders.  No 
wonder everyone calls them Overlamers.  The menu is too big, they 
forgot  to  delete  the graphics in the  borders!   How  are  you 
supposed to find any screen you want?  When you do find a  screen 
everything moves too fast for you to see.  The megascrollers  are 
so  big  that I had to put my monitor on the window and  climb  a 
hill on the other side of the valley to read them.  The 3D screen 
is  hopeless,  it  hardly jerks at all.  A lot  of  screens  have 
soundtracker  music  on them.  If god had wanted the ST  to  play 
sampled music he wouldn't have given it a YM2149F.  Coders should 
have  one screen devoted to soundtrack music  that  does  nothing 
else,  and they should make sure it takes so long to depack  that 
no-one will ever bother looking at it.  Message to the Overlamers 
-"Have you ever considered coding in STOS basic and using  single 
sided disks? If not do so for you next demo."

     Talking  about  computer magazines,  I'm glad ST  World  has 
gone. I bought every issue and it never had any games in it.
I  like Atari ST User as its always giving  me  viruses.  They're 
really funny!
     Maggie is good,  but as it is so small I usually drop it  in 
my goldfish bowl by mistake.
     The Inner Circle regularly buy Sinclair User so the  graphic 
artists  can get inspiration from the screen shots.  Master  only 
uses the top quality graphics programs - Dr. Doodle.
     I sometimes buy the Sunday Sport but I have to get my mum to 
read it to me and explain what the pictures mean.

     Well I hoped you liked my column,  and if I get enough  mail 
saying so, maybe I'll be back. Remember, the monkey style is in!
I must go now, I'm dying for a wank.
