What can I say??????

BIGFILM  LICENCE COSTA LOADA SPONDIES,  BOX ARTWORK  V.IMPRESSIVE, 
GAME  SET IN USUAL WAREHOUSE PLATFORM THING,  HERO HAS TO KILL OFF 
USUAL TERRORIST SCUMBAGS, DISARM THE SAME OL' BOMBS....

GRAPHICS  ARE  A  BLEND  OF ROBOCOP,  DOUBLE  DRAGON,  BATMAN  AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE WITH A FILM TITLE THAT Ocean HAVE DONE, IT SEEMS.. 
SOUND IS THE USUAL ST SOUNDCHIP MUSIC & FX....

YOU REALLY THINK THAT THEY WOULD TRY SOMETHING NEW FOR GODS  SAKE, 
BUT NO, HERE WE ARE YET AGAIN WITH THE SAME OLD TOSH......

Ratings:-

GRAPHIX:- 65% - competently done, but yawn!!

SONIX:- 60% - Heard this all before I think, ho hum!!

PLAYABILITY:- 65% - Not too bad, but seen it already, zzzzzz!!

OVERALL:-  55% - You would be forgiven for thinking that  computer 
games had not advanced since 1985,  judging solely by this effort, 
it does seem indeed,  that they have been doing this sort of thing 
(and getting away with it...) for years and years.....

(Whatever happened to EPIC!??!?!?!   Ocean have managed,  by their 
sheer  size and influence in the UK entertainment software  field, 
to  have  acquired a number of good,  and one or two  really  good 
titles  which  have yet to see the light of day....  Why  do  they 
persist  in releasing this kind of conveyor-belt coded shit on  an 
unsuspecting public!?!?!?!!?!?!!
