"The Alien has bred...
The Alien, the perfect organism. A killing machine whose physical 
excellence is matched only by its hostility.
Officer Ellen Ripley and the crew of the star ship Nostromo 
encountered one such creature, she alone survived the massacre. 
After floating in space for years Ripley is rescued only to learn 
she must return to the planet where her nightmare began. L.V.426, 
the world on which Ripley first encountered The Alien, has now been 
colonized. When communication is lost with the settlers, a team of 
battle hardened space marines are sent in, and Ripley with them...
What awaits them is not one creature, but thousands. The Alien has 
bred and this time it's all out war!
„ALIENS: The Special Edition is a version of this classic movie which 
has never seen before. It contains 17 minutes of extra footage 
restored to the original film by its director James Cameron.
THIS TIME IT'S MORE...!"

So much for the advert..... don't wait for more brilliant action 
scenes, because there are none. The additional stuff in the film is 
only useful to understand how The Alien infiltrated the settlers 
and some personal stuff about Ripley. There are also some scenes 
with robot sentries blasting a few Aliens - quite nice, if you like 
the sound of explosions and machineguns as I do..... hehehehe!
If you like Science Fiction movies with much action, this one is a 
must for you!
Lots of action, mindblasting special effects, good actors, fine 
dialogues and much psycho horror make this film worth looking and 
buying (but I think that everybody knows this, because he saw the 
'normal' version)!
If you want to buy a video film and don't have the cutted version of 
'Alien II' then buy the special edition of it - it's commendable.
