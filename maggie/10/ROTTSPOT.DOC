A smile, a song, and a small wooden leg.....

The usual sad collection of mismatched topics all collected 
together in one dustbin...

A Nintendo Interlude... A short story, by Gus Spank.... 

We popped around to Dalton's house, one Sunday, Dalton has this 
nice job, where he takes home bits of hardware and software to 
keep them "Safe and Comfortable," also, some "Testing" of these 
things goes on, and on this occasion, the Nintendo Super Famicon, 
a universal adaptor, and several cartridges, marked, 'For sale in 
the USA only' just had to be tested by us...

„A jaded palette restor'd?????

First up, „F-Zero, a rather scrunchy racer, with a huge amount of 
scrolling track, which goes very very fast, and needs a ton of 
processor time to do it all, Dalton, being terminally sick, would 
like to convert it to the ST, whilst he is doing it, he could make 
it a bit easier, as it is a fairly tough game, can he retain the 
music, which is a superior version of the 'Japanese 'Outrun-type' 
tune you get in most console games, I doubt it, somehow..

„Forgettable arcade-type game, which looks a bit like TURRICAN, 
only with more scrolling parallax, and most of the playability 
taken away.. Self descriptive really, also, the most expensive of 
the bunch at œ60.00 (œ60.00!!!!!!)

„Rocketeer, an all-formats due soon on the ST job, this plays like 
a Cinemaware type game, with lots of digitised in game graphix, 
looks like the PC VGA version, the first part of the game is an 
air racer, where to qualify to fly the rocket pack, you take up 
one of the most lethal aircraft ever built, the Lockheed GeeBee, 
which out of three built, two of them killed their pilots!!!
„
Drahken (Lands of???) A fantasy based RPG, with built in save/game 
function on the cartridge, at first sight, looks very much like an 
8-Bit NES port, (Which it probably was..) However, it is saved 
from mediocrity by some nice effects, such as the skyline run off 
the extended palette, and it has some music which is a cut above 
the average (If you ignore the rather inapropriate 'Outrun' style 
of music used for the travelling around the countryside bits.. 
This is a game based on the 'Dungeonmaster' genre, but more 
compact, and 'arcadey' in feel..
„
The Nintendo games are a bit of a mixed bag, I also played one of 
the better ones on Saturday, „Pilot Wings, Where you hang-glide, 
sky dive, and fly aircraft through courses, and land on particular 
target areas to gain points.. What sets this aside is the superb 
3-D scaling of the landscape, if you are flying towards an island 
in the middle of the Pacific, it sure does shift around like an 
island possessed and it manages to keep up a full amount of ground 
detail, even a long way out.. (Never mind, there is the pleasure 
of the Falcon to come..)

The other thing to bear in mind, is of course the cost of these 
things.. Prices „start at œ35.00 (a Microprose game..) and can go 
up to œ60.00 for some imported cartridges (Which is about 50% of 
the price of the latest cheap 16 bit sampler on the ST!!!) Crazy 
prices!! (The carts come in a nice box, so what...) Not forgetting 
Nintendo's attempts to bring feudalism to the electronic 
entertainment industry, so sorry, no dice.. I am also less 
convinced by their argument that monopoly control ensures quality 
of software, as yes, there were some good games, but there were 
definitely some borderline ones, and at least one crap one as 
well.. Long live independent software producers...

„I haven't started my 'STE Bitz' column yet, can you hang on a 
couple of days for the next instalment of this, whilst I do 
that...

Good, that's settled then, see you soon....

(The weather is not too bad at present, pleasantly sunny, but 
reasonably fresh, which is why I am writing at present, and not 
stuck prostrate in a deckchair...)

…       TORTURED CELEBRITIES...„ (Well it makes a change „dunnit..)

„Meanwhile, down in Dorset, something hilarious stirs..... The 
scene is the Trading Standards Dungeon, dimly lit by the light of 
several flickering torches.. The semi-conscious form of the South-
West PDL proprieter Martin Dryden lies, strapped to a rack, whilst 
a jackbooted representative of the BPI (British Phonographic Prats 
Institute) spits questions at him, in a harsh stacatto voice...

„BPI:- "Zzzzooo! is it true zat you haff been dealing mit zer 
Sample demos which deprive all right-thinking artistes of zair 
royalties!!" (Slap!!)

„Martin:- "(„Groan..) Is it true that you have just alienated all of 
the German readers with that „really stupid accent???"

„BPI;- "Yes, well, the central issue remains, that we think what 
you are doing is copyright infringement of original work..."

„Martin:- "Do you actually listen to any part of the music 
charts??"

„BPI:- "Well..............."

„Martin;- "I didn't think so, have you been able to work out how 
much material you can get on a floppy disk, not too much if you 
are playing back at any reasonable quality, The sensible view is 
that a sample demo is no replacement for a genuine recording.. How 
do you define 'sample demo' anyway, is this where whole sections 
of a song are cut and then pasted, or where individual instruments 
or riffs are used.. people are very confused at this time by your 
action.."
„
BPI:- (Furious..) "You have got a lot of breath left for someone 
who has has fifteen different kinds of wossname kicked out of 
him just now!!"

„Martin:- "And while we are on the subject, what is the BPI doing 
about the „real issues in popular music today.. Lame acts that 
can't sing live, and sample bits of old children's TV programmes. 
Albums that are about twenty minutes long, with five minutes of 
that good music.. Bloody ridiculous CD prices.. Bloody Top of the 
Bloody Pathetic bloody Pops... The career of Morrisey continues, 
to everyones dismay..."

„BPI:- (resigned..) "So if I put right all of these things, you 
will stop distributing sample demos??"

„Martin:- "It's a deal sunshine..."

…          THE ABOVE EXTRACT IS, OF COURSE, FICTICIOUS....„

However, we say GOOD LUCK MARTIN... don't let the bastards grind 
you down, or roughly fasten your gloppy bits to an electric 
sander, or......

.....Gloating over, back to the usual rubbish....

Which definitely describes the „Umpteenth Computer Shopper Show...

„Location:- Olympia, the scene of several much better shows in the 
past..

„ETA:- May-ish, I can't be bothered to remember in more detail..

„Category:- "I came to Olympia and only looted this lousy plastic 
bag.." Well it was a rather spiffy plastic bag by Elonex, a major 
PC clone manufacturer, jostling furiously for space with the other 
19 million and 97 PC clone manufacturers who unfortunately also 
decided to attend... This plastic bag was the most memorable thing 
about the show, apart from the brilliant 16-32 PDL returns service 
for faulty, hastily copied discs, (Original predicament:- 2 disc 
demo... Disc 'A' ok, Disc 'B' faulty.... After returning to 16-32, 
Disc 'A' ok, Disc 'B' now Disc 'A' as well, oh dear!!!!)

The other thing was the almost total lack of anything ST related, 
some oldish software, a few cheapo machines (2nd-Hand STFM at 
œ120?) But the majority of people stayed away in large numbers..

Equally caught out, were the crew behind newcomer Magazine 'ST-
Review' who had also expected to find a bit more than they did, a 
good long chat turned up, the fact that they were the only people 
to swim across Atari Germany's crocodile-filled moat, scale the 
sheer black, barbed wire topped walls, dodge the flame-tailed 
bullets, and get their first look at the Falcon....

The sole software house was a rather lonely Digital Integration, 
showing a preview version of their new flight-sim, „Tornado which 
looked rather good, and also looked like it was running on a PC..

I was aided and abetted by Felice (Richard..) The aiding and 
abetting process starting rather abruptly at 7.30 am (Note for 
future reference:- Anyone using my entryphone buzzer need only do 
so for a „very short time unless I am dead, and even then, I will 
probably wake up quickly enough..) 

He enjoyed it as much as I did (not a lot..)

There are better shows, which will get reviewed here, but I would 
suggest that in future, attendence at Shopper Shows is not 
mandatory, and in fact, a waste of time, unless you want to buy a 
new PC clone (and do little else...)

… Shitty luck time....

And so to the end, Cah! this is the absolute penultimate, cut off 
in its prime, issue ten out soon, readallaboutit,,,

I would have written more if the time was there, the definitive 
look at the newest TCB production, the AN Cool „Music Demo 3, with 
several bits of Swedish electro-house music, and the remarkably 
piss-poor animated cartoon elephant sequence, reviews of „Trex 
Warrior (brilliant..) and „Epic (Oh dearie me...) „Fire and Ice, 
(Nice Graftgold platform game) and „Populous II, will not now 
appear in issue 10. Likewise the answer to Richard Karsmakers 
"Quest for perfect English.." supplied courtesy of 'The Campaign 
for Plain English' will have to wait for another issue...

Time to sign off and get this lot jiffied up and off to Germany...

 (C) CIH all over the place again....
