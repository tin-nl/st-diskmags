„Review by New Mode on 23rd of July 1992



Again a demo from Funland? That was the first question that 
popped up in my mind when I received the disk. Well, we didn't 
have any big demos from Finland since ages, so it really was a 
surprise. 
It was also me who reviewed Kruz' first demo called "Awakening 
of the Gods" and I told that they will improve a lot. And they 
have improved a lot, believe me.

Ok, traditional review follows...


 Intro:

Not really something you would call amazing. Just a few pictures 
(not too bad) are faded in/out. Synth Dream music. But you 
haven't got to use full CPU power in all your screens, have you?

 
Menu:

Some people really seem to read what we write, or maybe they just 
know what bores the most : GAME MENUS! 
Kruz have done a really good menu with a very big spaceship in 
filled vectors. You have to fly around in a 3D landscape (not 
really) and you select the screens by landing on various balls.
But never mind : „There is an alternative menu!!!! Just press HELP 
and you can select every screen with a simple press on the 
functionkeys. And the menu is even kept in memory!
10 POINTS FOR YOU, KRUZ! :-)


 DDD:

I would call this screen "FFFDDD" instead. Fucking Fast Finnish 
3D. Plane-, Glenz-, Lighsourced-, Transforming vectors. Very big 
objects and all running at full frame rate. Pretty impressive 
coding but still the screen is like all the other 3D shows : 
boring to look at. Because I am currently also working on my 
polyroutine and I know how fucking hard it is to optimize it, I 
have to say that Kruz have done a fairly clever job here. 


 Pax Plax Parallax:

A two layer parallax background scrolling and a big one plane 
scroller. It's in fullscreen.


 Kruz - Finland:

A fullscreen with colourdister and a heap of balls. Spaz' 
megadeath font is scrolling with a scrolltext that's written in a 
funny language (sm±rebr³d or something similar).


 Twin-Twist:

Again a fullscreen. Two twist scrollers, each of them half a 
screen big. Looks nice. The technique to draw just one half of 
the screen is quite useful, isn't it? ;)

 
Universal Coders:

And again a fullscreen. Seems like all the coders nowadays have 
to prove that they can do everything in fullscreens. I call it 
masochism, but read about that down there.
This screen is actually rather nice, with a very big disting 
Armada logo (a new finnish Union). The logo is bad because it's 
zoomed and therefore it looks like one of the pictures on a 
f*cking VGA monitor, very blocky (hey, I can't get control over 
myself if I just think about these goddamned PCs. People 
interested in an association against Pissies please write to our 
HQ).
Ok, interruption over now. There's also a nice charset up there 
bouncing up and down. This screen is ok.


 Reset-Demo:

A bloody nice effect with masking triangles (filled of course). 
And some texts telling you about credits, etc.  Very cool screen.


Concluding :

Kruz has become a respectable crew with this demo. They have 
showed that they are very good coders now.

At last some general remarks about our reviews here.

Some people will say we're slagging all the demos off and we 
should give higher ratings. But we don't think so. We're just 
trying to show the people (as good as we can do) what's wrong 
with their demos. If you look at new Amiga demos ("Hardwired", 
"Guardian Dragon II", etc. etc.) you can see things you've never 
seen in ST demos. It's not that heavy coding, it's DESIGN. And 
design is missing in almost every demo. Forget your fullscreens 
and tracker replayers, just think about new ideas and realize 
them. Because when we all change to Falcon 030 soon and maybe 
some Amiga people will change too, we won't stand a chance 
against them, none of us.
Fullscreens killed our ideas, really. That's why DELTA FORCE are 
not doing any synchron stuff like fullscreens, borders or 
coloursplits anymore. Some people will be disappointed when we 
release our new demo because the usual 
"Colourdister&Hardscroller&Trackermusic screens" are missing, but 
if just 10% of you dear readers understand what we mean, we will 
be really happy people. Good night Europe.
