
 THE NEWS CORNER


This time the News Corner is really small. If you send us enough 
good (and true) news, we'll include them in this part of the 
magazine.


THE SCENE :

-----------------------------------------------------------------

We have a new member. His name is Mark and he's a brilliant 
coder. He's a professional game programmer and he's Karl's 
friend (and ours too!). So we have two British members now! 
WELCOME MARK!!!!!!!!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NeXT have finally released the „Phaleon Demo. Four disks, pheeew!   

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NeXT will go on with the charts if there are enough people   
voting. So go on, send your votes to them!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Hemoroids are also starting to do charts. Their charts are 
called „The Hitcharts. What we've seen so far, their charts will 
be like the (now dead) „Eurochart on Amiga. They will include a 
gallery where some freaks can be seen. Vote now!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Our music demo called „Torture Your Ears is still not released. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Daniel (the coder responsible) is in the army now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

For all the guys who didn't get it yet :
                           Daniel (DF) = The One (Phalanx)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

We have released a little demo called "DELTA FORCE GOES SVERIGE". 
It's a slideshow with pictures from our trip to Sweden. Get it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Mad Vision are doing a new disk magazine called "Amazine". The 
articles are interesting since they're about the scene.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

There's an extremely stupid photo of parts of Delta Force (TEX,   
ULM, Omega and Respectables also) in TOS magazine issue 7/92.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tyrem of the Respectables is in the army now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hemoroids have released a neat dentro recently.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Big Alec is doing the music for „No Second Prize by Thalion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Delta Force is working on a new demo called „Shock Therapy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Still no sign of the longawaited TCB demo. Rumours say, that   
TCB are dead and that they have skipped a lot of screens they   
already had prepared because other groups have released similar   
ones already.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Delta Force will probably be doing an I.C.C. #3. This time it 
won't be a party for the scene, just for our very close friends. 
More details won't be told right now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Burglars came to Axe's (Superior) flat and stole all his 
equipment. Computer, videorecoder and all his disks. Too bad he 
hasn't got an insurance. So it's not sure if there ever will be a 
new version of „Ice Packer.
Latest news : Axe bought a new computer! (again an ST)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Budgie UK are not distributing diskmagazines anymore. Too tough 
language they say. Well... Not everything can be like the bible, 
eh?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A new group is born : Aura. Raised from the ashes of Axxis. Not 
more is known. Ah, they've released a demo called „The World is my 
Oyster.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
„
A lot of groups are going to do fake I.C.C.s„. We've heard about 
one in Norway this summer and the latest information is that 
another group is doing a fake I.C.C. in Finland this August. WE 
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THESE PARTIES!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Ripped Off are holding a party in Yorkshire/England in September. 
From what we've seen so far this will be a very nice party with 
lots of entertainment. Contact Ripped Off or us for an 
invitation. But remember : ˆNO answer without an International 
Reply Coupon, ok?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Some French groups like OVR, Legacy, ST-Connexion are doing a 
demo together. Name is „The Froggie Demo. This is sure something 
to keep on waiting for (and since ST-CNX is involved in this 
project, you'll maybe never see this demo, hehe).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

We've heard about a French TV channel where all kinds of demos 
are shown. Please tell us more about it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hemoroids will be doing a beach party this summer. For more 
information contact them. People say that prizes for the demo 
competitions will be awesome!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Overlanders are NOT dead. We've seen previews of the almost 
finished "Ventura" demo and it looked pretty impressive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Legacy seem to have new members. Walt and Audiomonster of Silents 
(one of the biggest and best Amiga crews). Just listen at the 
tune in the new Legacy dentro, really good.

-----------------------------------------------------------------





SOFTWARE:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Esion Tracker is now called Protracker. Version 2.0 is currently 
being betatested. By the way, Wizzcat is the author of this 
superb tracker. He's still looking for distributors of this fab 
program.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

NEOchrome v2.28 is out now. Changes from 2.27? Just again some 
bugfixes.
Chaos, Inc. has stopped releasing new version now since he still 
hasn't got a reaction from Atari although they promised to write 
until February. Now we have July and nothing happened.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Thalion more and more becomes an Amiga company. At the moment 
they are running a big advert together with Commodore. Amiga 500 
including „Airbus. The ultimate package they say. Pffff, this 
package isn't even cheaper than an original Amiga with Airbus!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

„Amberstar by Thalion has been released and got quite good 
reviews.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Rumours say that Markus Fritze has stopped coding on „Turbo 
Assembler. The shareware concept didn't work. So no versions for 
TT or even Falcon will show up. I really feel sorry about this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

„Devpac 3 is out on Amiga. From what I've seen so far it looks 
pretty good. It supports all 680x0 assemblers and some arithmetic 
processors. Why the ST version isn't out yet? Who knows?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

„Crackart is a new painting program in the style of Degas. A lot 
of useful functions and all in all something worthy to get. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------






HARDWARE:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Commodore has released the Amiga 600. The only major changes are: 
- No numeric keypad, so the machine itself is lots smaller
- Kickstart 2.05 is included
- 1meg Chipram
- Everything is in SMD technique
- TV modulator
- Memory card concept
This machine got terribly slagged off in all German Amiga mags, 
quite obvious since it doesn't offer anything new.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Still no sign of Atari's Falcon 30. Rumours say that several 
developpers have received a machine now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Seems like all the information about the Falcon we had in the 
last issue is true. Insiders tell something about an Atari 
Developper meeting at the end of June. As soon as we get more 
information we'll let you know.
The DSP (Digital Signal Processor) is not responsible for the 
music. Instead we'll have an 8 channel, 16 bit soundchip. It will 
be able to play frequencies up to 50khz, so who needs more? 
32768 colours on screen together with overscan.
The only problem will be, that Atari will include an improved STE 
blitter. So no big custom chips for realtime rotation.
Price will be around 1100DM (~ $750) for a 4meg Falcon 030 
without monitor/harddisk of course.
-----------------------------------------------------------------


MUSIC:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Skinny Puppy have released their new album called „Last Rights.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

All the Front 242 CDs will be taken from the market and will be   
rereleased. They will feature a new cover and some bonus   
tracks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Leaetherstrip have released their new album called „Solitary   
Confinement. There's a nice song called „Croatia on it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Skinny Puppy will be touring through Europe this summer! Don't   
dare to miss them!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Nirvana is the biggest hype so far.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Leaetherstrip will be touring in Germany at the end of this Year.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Bands you have to get CDs from :

Leaetherstrip, Front 242, Skinny Puppy, Frontline Assembly, 
Armageddon Dildos, The Klinik, Project Pitchfork, Die Krupps, 
Mussolini Headkick, A Split Second, Cassandra Complex, ...



MOVIES:


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Arnold Schwarzenegger is currently working on another comedy   
like „Twins.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

„Aliens III and „Batman II will be out in Europe at the time you 
read this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

„The Lawnmover Man is a new movie based on a book by Steven King. 
The story is supposed to play in the cyberspace scene, the movie 
itself has lots of computer animations. Seems like a 92 edition 
of „Tron. Freaks shouldn't miss this one.
