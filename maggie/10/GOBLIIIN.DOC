Hmmm, it seems as if I transformed from a graphics freak into a 
article writer eh? Oh well, somebody has to write something and I 
thought that I could be that person....

What's Gobliiins? Why is it written with three 'i'? Very simple! In 
this game you play three little Goblins.
Every Goblin has its own abilities. One is a - hmm what can I call 
him? - athlete. He has power and muscles but no brain. He is able 
to punch against objects to move something and to climb. The second 
is a sorcerer. He has some magic power and can turn objects in 
others things or force something to do something (see yourself). 
The last one is the man with the brain. He has the ability to use 
the different objects - but he always can use one - and he is the 
only one of the three guys who can take objects.

What's the aim of the game? Hmmm? You have to find out yourself! I 
only tell you that somebody unknown is torturing the king of the 
Goblins by using a Voodoo doll of him. You can see it in the fine 
animated intro, which contains some nice graphics but extreme awful 
digisound. You can quit the intro only by pressing Escape.
OK, so far for the intro. After I pressed Escape a not too bad 
looking picture appears after a real short loading time. Pressing 
Escape again to exit the picture and a diskchange screen fades in. 
Now I have to change the first of three disks. So I push the second 
disk in the slot of my drive and press Space to see what's coming 
next........

After some loading time the game starts. Now what's that? No 
vertical or horizontal scrolling! Just a picture with the three 
Goblins in it. You have to solve one picture after the other and for 
each solved picture you get a code. The graphics are average, the 
sound absurd and the game fun is OK - but it turns into frustration 
if you can't solve the picture after the fifth try!
You control the Goblins by mouse. The mouse arrow jerks a little, 
but that is no problem for the game. By pressing the right mouse 
button you can choose between the different modes. First is the 
'walk' mode. You click on the picture where the selected Goblin 
should go to. The second is the 'action' mode. The athlete can 
punch, the sorcerer can practice some magic and the guy with the 
brain uses the object he actually hold (you see it in the upper 
board). The third mode is only available for the IQ freak. I call 
it the 'take' mode. Explains everything eh?
When you solved a picture a ->GO<- appears and after you clicked on 
it you'll get the code for the next picture.

The loading times between the single pictures are bearable and you 
can see a Goblin with a disk using it as a tray. Looks funny, 
although after you seen it ten times it's just boring!
If you fail in solving a picture (that means you lost all your 
energy) you can start it again without entering the code. But I 
have to say that I don't understand why the coder of the game have 
to reload the picture. I think it is in memory, isn't it?

As a final r‚sum‚ I think that this game is quite funny but 
sometimes extremely boring (if you can't solve a picture). For 
everyone who likes riddle games it is OK. Everyone who likes action 
or roleplay stuff - three wasted disks!
And you have to remember that if you solved the complete game the 
game is worthless - nothing new will happen when you play it again.
