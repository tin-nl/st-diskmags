
CHAPTER 10

     By the time he arrived, I was in a state. I'd dome everything 
I could to prepare -- tanned like crazy, read up all I could about 
his damn ol' Mets, even bought a sexy peignoir -- and laid in plans 
for It. I was determined to seduce my step-brother. The night 
before he was arrive at Toledo Express Airport (which he always 
referred to as "Toledo International Spaceport," just to rub it in) 
I showered and stood bare-butt naked in from of the mirror on the 
back of the door to the room I shared with Jeanne. I looked myself 
over.
     All of a sudden, in the past three weeks, I'd started 
developing again -- wildly. My bust was up to a 29C and my waist 
was still a little bitty 19 and my hips were barely 26 inches. I 
was as tan as I could be and my hair, which hadn't been more than 
trimmed in six months, reached straight and sleek halfway down my 
back. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I knew I was damn sexy 
and I knew that if I couldn't get to him now, I never would. I also 
knew I had to be Cool -- not too pushy, very much in control. I had 
it all planned out, oh yes I did.
     I went with Dad and Mom to the airport to meet him. He hugged 
me the way he hugged everyone else and I made damn sure that the 
sleeveless top I wore was the only thing I wore on top, so he could 
feel my boobs press into him. I sat next to him in the station 
wagon as Dad drove us all back from the airport, and I made sure I 
was scrunched over so my thigh (bare beneath the cutoffs jeans) was 
against his. And I could not remember a thing about staying cool. 
Because he was an absolute fox.
     He was a little under six feet tall and had this light brown 
hair, except for a -- can you believe it? -- red forelock and had 
these really light hazel eyes and a cute face and what a damn built 
he had on him! He'd picked up his suitcases from the conveyor belt 
as if they'd been empty; when Jeanne and I tried to help we nearly 
got ruptured. Even Dad couldn't lift one of them that easily!
     All the way back from the airport we made small talk, and he 
was always completely in control. When we passed Route 23 and I 
leaned over (supposedly) to point to the new bowling alleys (and 
not incidentally press my boobs into his arm) he just gave me a 
quick glance and a funny little half-smile and I wanted to cross my 
legs 'cause I was getting so wet down there.
     By the time we'd reached the house, Mom had already told him I 
was having some friends over for a slumber party (heh) and since 
Dad was on midnight shifts and she tired out early, he agreed to 
watch over us kids (double-heh) that night.
     All was in readiness.
    I brushed my  teeth twice and showered and then gargled and 
showered again and generally made myself as clean as possible. Then 
I doused myself with Windsong and paraded around the house after 
dinner in my swimsuit bottoms and a tee-shirt and nothing else and 
told him I hoped he didn't mind watching us, et cetera, and found 
every excuse I could to lean against him.
     At seven, my friends started arriving and at eight he had 
finished calling all the aunts, uncles and cousins he had to touch 
base with. At nine, my brothers were sent to bed and Jeanne, 
pleading weariness, sacked it. Alexis was out on a date and Mom was 
fading fast. At ten, Dad was dressed and ready to leave for work 
(he always got to work early; Dad was a Depression baby and 
believed in showing up very early) and Mom was fighting to stay 
awake.
     At ten-thirty, it was four of my friends and me and my phantom 
step-brother, who was sitting at the dining room table, reading a 
paperback and scarfing down peanut butter sandwiches.
     At  eleven, I sprung my trap. I pulled a chair away from the 
table and sat facing him.
     "Yes?" he asked, looking up from his PB&Js and his book.
     "Antisocial?"
     He grinned and closed the book. "Meaning?"
     "Come in and talk to us. Lisa's here, y'know."
     "Lisa's still five years younger  than  me,"  he  said,  not
inaccurately. "And she'd probably prefer not to be reminded of the 
potato chips."
     I laughed  at that. He hadn't forgotten any more than I -- or 
Lisa -- had forgotten. "We'd like you tell us about what it's like 
being in New York."
     He put that stare of his on me. Held it for about a ten-count. 
Then smiled oddly and shook his head. "Somehow, I don't imagine a 
bunch of thirteen-year-old kids really being that interested in 
life in Brooklyn."
     "Oh, come in  and talk to us." I  squirmed in mock-
coquettishness, "There's a bunch of nubile young women waiting for 
the pleasure of your company."
     I thought he'd choke, holding back  the  laughter.  Finally: 
"'Nubile'?" He rose and stood beside my chair. He was wearing faded 
old jeans and a Mets tee-shirt and I was fully prepared to unzip 
and gulp him right then and there. "Lead on," he said, fighting a 
grin.
     I stood, letting myself get closer than I had to, and drew him 
by the hand into the family room. "Look what I found," I announced. 
"This calls for a beer," said Dana Connally. And produced same from 
her huge overnight bag. Debbie didn't have much in the way of a 
figure, but what she had, she knew how to use. She was wearing a 
flannel shorty nightgown and it somehow was sexier on her than my 
filmy little peignoir could ever be. I grabbed one of her beers and 
gulped it. Dan merely watched as I let myself fall into the old 
recliner. He was sitting on the old couch, no more than two feet 
away. Lisa was next to him and Dana was on the other side of Lisa 
from her. The other two, Angela and Barb, were on the floor, far, 
far away and dubious -- and fading fast.
     The beer hit me fast and hard. I said things I shouldn't have 
said, even mentioned the potato chips. Dan reached past Dana to put 
his arm around Lisa and said he would have kept them to that very 
day if they hadn't gone stale and soft with age. Lisa blushed and 
scurried away. Debbie squirmed in closer to him and grabbed his 
hand and held it.
     I was still in the armchair. I asked him if he had a 
girlfriend and tried to steer things in that direction. 
Occasionally, I made some snide remarks to Debbie -- about where 
she was putting her hand, about how short her nightie was -- and 
generally got stupid. My plan was dissolving.
     Somehow, the subject turned to comparing Ohio girls with New 
York girls, he said New York girls were more sophisticated in some 
ways, but Ohio girls were a little more direct -- and he liked 
that.
     "What do you mean?"
     "Well, in New York, girls play games, act like they don't want 
the same things the guys want -- like what they've got is some kind 
of prize, y'know? Here, the girls don't mind letting it be known 
what they like and what they don't want. I like the honesty."
     "You mean girls here are easier."
     "Not 'bad' easier, but...less hung up. Yeah, easier, if honest 
means easy." He paused and grinned. "And healthier."
     "Waddya mean?"
     "Girls out here  seem to grow up physically a lot sooner and 
more emphatically."
     He winked at me.
     "You mean, like bigger tits sooner?" Dana asked. "You betcha."
     "Like Marie's?" she asked.
     "Yeah. Too bad she's just a kid."
     I took offense at that and opened the robe of my peignoir. I 
wasn't wearing a bra beneath the chemise and it was all lacy and a 
little too tight on my tits. "Who's a kid?" I demanded.
     "Marie, you're all growed out real good," he said. "But you're 
my sister and you're still too young."
     Blame it on the beer. I ran my hands up and cupped my tits. 
"'If they're big enough, they're old enough.' Isn't that what they 
say? And aren't these big enough?"
     He pulled his gaze from my breasts to my eyes. "Don't fuck 
with my head," he said quietly. "You know I like you, you know I 
think you're sexy and you know you're my sister."
     "And you know were not related by blood, so don;t give me 
that...or are you just mouthing off about me being attractive?"
     "Sure, and the first time I touch you, you'll go screaming."
     "No I won't. Go on -- do it."
     And there, in that dimly lit room, he leaned forward and put 
his hand on my bare shoulder. He slid it down and just barely 
pressed my breasts through the bodice of the chemise. I damn near 
came right then and there. When his palm was over my right nipple, 
I said, "I'm not screaming."
     His fingers closed on my nipple through the satin and he 
pulled it a bit. And said: "Are you trying to prove something to 
me, to you -- or to your friends?"
     For a few minutes, it had just been him and me,  but  now  I
remembered the others sitting around and I thought of the stories 
they would tell...
     He took his hand away. "I think it's time to call it a night. 
Enjoy your party, girls." He got up and went into the living room, 
where his pullout was.
     There were more beers and then we all sort of crashed, there 
on the floor, on the couch and on cushions and Angie just sprawled 
on some blankets and slept. The beer took its toll on me and I was 
out pretty fast.
     It took another toll, too. Around dawn I got up to pee and 
that was when I heard the noises in the living room. I crept 
silently to the corner, at the place where the stairs went up, and 
that was when I saw Dana betray me.
     Dan was sitting on the living room couch, perched on the edge 
of the cushion, and Dana was straddling him. They were kissing hot 
and wet and with a lot of tongue. I watched him slide his hands up 
under her nightgown and then he was lifting it. She didn't have 
much in the way of tits, but what she had got plenty of attention. 
Dan licked and kissed and sucked those hard little mounds while 
she, all long and lean and lanky and sinuous, held his face against 
them. He moved one hand down to rub around he cunt. She didn't have 
much hair down there, but she had what he was looking or -- and 
vice versa. I could hear his finger squish into her and her 
breathing got faster.
     I also heard his soft sigh when he pulled his dick out through 
the opening in his briefs and settled her onto it. Dana was taller 
than me by a good seven or eight inches, but her hips and butt were 
almost as small as mine and she had to work her way down onto him. 
I only got a glimpse, but his cock was about average length and a 
little thicker than most and hard as a bar of iron. It was a tight 
fit and all the time she was settling onto it, he kept licking and 
sucking her nipples.
     I could have killed her. I was the one who wanted him! Besides 
-- he was MY brother!
     He put his hands on her skinny hips and guided her as she 
worked up and down, back and forth. She was long-legged, Dana was, 
and had her feet on the floor on either side of his legs. She did 
the work, but I could hear both of them breathing harder and I 
could hear her cunt suck and squish on him as she moved up and 
down.
     He settled against the back of the couch, his butt still 
perched at the edge of the cushion, and moved his hands up to hold 
her forearms as she leaned back. Both of them began moving, faster 
and faster.I saw her bite her lower lip when she started to cum and 
then he hunched his hips up at her and held them there and I knew 
he was cumming in her.
     Damn her!
    He  pulled her forward against him and I heard his dick slurp 
out of her as he kissed her lips and cradled her to him, exactly 
the way and the time I'd always wanted.
     She slithered out of his arms an knelt between his leg and 
kissed and sucked his spermy dick until it was clean. Then she 
rearranged her nightgown and whispered something to him.
     I scurried back to my cushions on the floor just before  she
reappeared in the TV room. All I could think of was the fact that 
she had his cum in her cunt, and I did not.
     I spent most of the next day sulking. I was not a good hostess 
to Angela and Barb and I was downright rude to Dana. And she seemed 
to know I knew what had gone on and worse, to know I was wildly 
jealous. I determined to make my phantom step-brother spend a lot 
of time dating the Palm Sisters by showing off my assets for him 
whenever I could get away with it. The problem was that I didn't 
get much of a chance. That day he went out to a small town about 45 
miles from our house to visit other relatives and the next day he 
went out there again. Our mutual cousin Shana explained: Dan 
apparently had developed a terrific crush on Dorothy, a friend of 
hers with a sweet face, a gentle disposition and a Body by Hefner.
     Shana was willing to talk about it in some detail. She and Dan 
had kept up a regular correspondence year-round -- which I'd known 
about for quite a while -- and they had a lot to talk about. She'd 
arranged for a bunch of her friends from school -- most of whom 
were close to her and Dan's age -- to wander over to the Dairy 
Queen by the quarry-cum-town-swimming-hole and Hang Out. He and 
Dorothy had taken an immediate shine to each other, which was no 
surprise in either direction. Shana knew there'd been some 
smooching and groping, but doubted it had gone very much farther 
than that. Dorothy had a reputation for politely-but-firmly 
refusing to Go Too Far.
     It was enough to put Dorothy on my perpetual hit list, 
thinking about her acting like a priss and leaving my gorgeous Dan 
with blue balls. Grrrrrr.
     The next day he spent helping Mom around the house and with 
her chores and I spent most of it flashing him. It had an effect, 
much to my pleasure. I kept thinking, Look what you missed and eat 
your heart out! What I really wanted, though, was to tell him to 
eat me.
     The next day, a Friday, he was going out there again. This 
time he was to stay over with Aunt Mimi -- Shana's Mom -- and I 
decided it was time to cultivate Shana's little sister, Irene. She 
was about my age, but looked a lot more like it, maybe even less. 
But she was bright and a bit hyperactive and jealous of the girls 
who, like Annette Funicello, "already got theirs" and determined to 
prove herself in competition with them, i.e., get the guys. She 
hadn't seen Dan yet on this visit -- she'd been away at a horse 
farm for a couple of days -- and was really looking forward to the 
visit. Eventually, by clever manipulation and downright lying, I 
lured her into "deciding" it would be nice for me to stay for an 
overnighter at the same time Dan did. The way I figured it, I would 
wait until Dan got back from what was sure to be a heated and -- 
ultimately -- frustrating evening with Dorothy and then I'd have 
him! Aha!
     Shana and Dan kissed lightly and sweetly, a non-erotic peck of 
warmth and greeting and then we all piled into the Blue Bomb -- a 
seven-year-old Buick she was entitled to drive by virtue of her age 
and relatively rural location. I would have been pleased and 
excited at the start of my little adventure, except that Shana had 
a  passenger: Dorothy.
     She was absolutely lovely and unselfconsciously sexy at the 
same time, with her dark hair and flawless complexion and full lips 
and wide eyes and that amazing damn body with those fantastically 
firm, full tits under a tee-shirt and barely contained by a bra I 
was sure she wore more for modesty than support. She was sixteen 
and in full bloom. I think of how she looked through the window of 
the Blue Bomb and I can understand why it was not unusual for our 
grandparents and great-grandparents to marry at fifteen and 
sixteen. Shana made some joke about it, but I didn't laugh when I 
found myself in the front seat with my cousin...leaving Dorothy and 
Dan in the back. The held hands tightly through the entire forty-
minute drive. I dared sneak only two or three glances back at them 
all the time.
     Those Buicks were big. There was plenty of room. Most of it 
was unused because they were very close together.
     Still, it was impossible to keep a mad on at Aunt Mimi's. She 
and Uncle Don got married when she was fifteen and he was seventeen 
and the love between them pervaded the entire old ramshackle house. 
She was a big, rawboned, horsy-faced lady of indeterminate years 
and great big laughing eyes that made you forget the moustache that 
never seemed to go away (no matter what she did) and the little 
stubble of a beard s'help me on her chin. She made a fuss over Dan, 
of course, and over me and kidded me about the way my figure had 
developed. Somehow, the way she did it, made it seem remarkable 
that I had such a body, but perfectly Okay and Set Yerself Down 
Here and Have Some Pop and Tell Yer Old Aunt Mimi What You've Been 
Up To, Why Doncha? We had dropped Dorothy at her house and Dan was 
nice and polite and went into the back yard to talk with Shana 
about her drawings and her first pastels.
     All of which was fine until we heard car doors slam. Dan went 
into the living room to greet Irene. She was all lithe and lean and 
tousled blonde hair and little kiddish with tiny bumps inside her 
shirt and she greeted Dan by jumping him!
     Yeah, she literally jumped up on him, wrapping her arms around 
his neck and her legs around his hips. She kissed him right on the 
mouth, hard and maybe deep and Dan went all red in the face and 
pulled her off him. I could see a bulge in his cutoff jeans. He 
tried to hide it, but failed. Irene had two of her little friends 
with her and a few minutes later, cousin Timmy -- Shana's big 
brother and Aunt Mimi's oldest -- came in. Timmy was Dan's age and 
a really ruggedly handsome guy even then. Unfortunately, some of 
the circuits in his head didn't work. Timmy couldn't deal with 
books and reading or any kind of pressure; he would go into these 
fits. And he was not particularly gentle, either. Timmy did what he 
liked and could get away with.  I  was  never  really comfortable 
around him and I could see Dan wasn't, either, but he was polite 
and tried to be warm, which was more than I could do. See, any time 
Timmy was alone with me, he was always grabbing my tits -- hard.
     I had to follow through with my charade and immediately 
diverted Irene -- who seemed reluctant to leave Dan, which bothered 
me. She took me to her room an I went through what was probably the 
bonding ritual of girls our age at that time, discussing boys, the 
Beatles, clothes, the Beatles, jealousies, the Beatles, free love, 
the Beatles, the new Rolling Stones poster (clearly showing Mick's 
bulge) and, of course, the Beatles.
     [My favorite was George. Okay? Thank you.]
     We listened to some 45s and then we were going over to the DQ 
-- [Dairy Queen.] -- to hang out. I was very agreeable to this, as 
I knew that eventually, Dan and Dorothy would show up there. The 
adjacent park -- Veteran's -- was about the only place they could 
go and fool around, since neither had wheels. I hated the idea, yet 
I wanted to see them together. I dunno why; I just did.
     Anyhow, going over to the DQ and meeting Irene's friends was 
about as exciting as I expected -- deadly dull. The boys in the 
crowd were typical of boys my age, which is to say I had outgrown 
them a long time ago, but they kept trying to "accidentally" touch 
my tits or get me alone. After what seemed like years there, Irene 
and I walked back to her house. She told me she was glad I had 
spurned -- she used that word -- the boys who were turned on by my 
tits. She hoped that would help them look for other qualities in a 
girl.
     I told her to hold her breath till they were nineteen or so.
     She asked, How do you know? and I, like an idiot, told her a 
little bit and hinted at more.
     [Why "like an idiot"? Listen -- and stop interrupting me -- 
and I'll tell you.]
     Well, Irene decided that meant she could tell me stuff. Like, 
for one, she'd Done It. She wouldn't tell me who, but she had done 
it and more than once and she liked it. A lot. She also told me 
that at some point during the day -- probably when she went 
downstairs to get the disgusting Cherry Kool-Aid for us -- she'd 
been briefly alone with Dan and kissed him again and touched his 
hard on. He'd made her stop.
     He'd told her she was a little young for that and she'd told 
him she was more than willing to give him a demonstration of her 
abilities and he'd told her she should wait a little longer for 
that.
     By the time she finished the tale -- and we were nearing her 
house, in the dark small-town Ohio July night -- her nipples were 
stiff as pencil points inside her sadly flat tee-shirt.
     "And I really want to -- y'know -- DO IT with him now."
     That was when we heard the noise from the side of the house. 
Quietly, we crept to the edge of the hedge and looked.
     My phantom step-brother was licking Dorothy's nipples.
     They were clinching in the shadows near a tree -- an elm, I 
remember distinctly -- and he had her light shirt raised and her 
bra opened. Her breasts were truly magnificent and he was giving 
them their due. He cupped them gently in his hand -- they needed 
hardly any support of any kind, as large and thrusting as they were 
-- and was running his lips over and around them and then licking 
and sucking her nipples. Her flush was visible even in the shadows. 
Her cutoff clad legs were wide and he was rubbing his hand over the 
tightly-stretched denim over her cunt and she was rubbing up 
against his fingers.
     I was horrified and turned on at the same time.
     "Do you think they're gonna do it?" Irene whispered.
     I just shook my head, unwilling to trust my voice.
     I watched  him caress those lovely sixteen-year-old tits and 
the damp jeans taut over her swampy sixteen-year-old cunt and I was 
sure he was going to fuck her...but when he tried to unsnap the 
waist of the cutoffs, she stopped him. Again and again, no matter 
how turned on they got, she stopped him.
     As I'd expected.
     They  were at that awful point where she was rubbing his dick 
through his now-very-tight jeans and he was rubbing her pussy hard 
enough to split the soaked fabric of her jeans and I was ready to 
stand up and march over and offer to take over for her, since she 
seemed unwilling to do the right thing herself. At that very point 
the side door opened and the outside light came on -- one of those 
yellow things that's not supposed to attract bugs but always does -
- and Shana stuck her head out.
     "Hey, you guys -- getting late." And ducked back in.
     They stayed there in the shadows for a few minutes more, 
murmuring and cuddling and then she stood and he stood and they 
clinched and then she walked off alone down the safe summer streets 
of that little town.
     Dan had a huge bulge in the front of his jeans. He stood, 
watching her until she was out of sight, and then sighed and went 
inside. "Did you see his hard-on?" Irene whispered excitedly. "The 
way his jeans were all stuck out from it?" She giggled. I glanced 
at her. Even in the shadows I could see her flush -- and the stiff 
points of her nipples against her shirt. "Isn't he hot?"
     I nodded and thought about it. My plan was foolproof. He'd 
just spent about forty minutes getting turned on by her and needed 
relief. So far so good. He was going to be staying over in the same 
house as me. Still good. Aunt Mimi's snoring would pretty much have 
immunized everyone in the house against waking at small sounds. 
Right on track. And Dan was going to be mooning over Dorothy and 
that was bad. He was such a romantic -- not that he'd ever admit it 
-- that he'd probably not even look at another woman, let alone a 
girl who happened to be his step-sister. It would be like Dan to 
think of that as being unfaithful.
     "We'd better go inside," I said. Irene and I sneaked through 
the bushes, then walked loudly down the sidewalk and entered the 
front door. Dan was sitting up with Shana, watching an Outer Limits  
episode.
      Everyone else was sleeping. We got some pop and sat with him 
for a while. Irene excused herself after a while and came back in a 
shorty nightgown. You could glimpse her lean silhouette through it, 
but that didn't make any difference; there wasn't much to see.
     Shana said that looked like a good idea and did the same. With 
her lustrous, dark curls and dark flashing eyes, she looked so 
lovely that I began to think about her, for the first time, as a 
woman and not as my sweet cousin. As the show ended and the news 
came on WTOL, channel 11 -- which we had to watch to get the scores 
for his damn ol' Mets -- I excused myself and changed, too. I'd 
brought just a simple, summer-light  shorty nightgown. I didn't 
bother with a bra. When I came back in the room, Shana -- always 
forthright -- said, "My goodness, Marie! Where did you ever get 
those big, uh, bosoms? You make me feel positively flat-chested!"
     "How do you think she makes me feel?" Irene murmured.
     "They were on sale at Tiedtke's," I said. "Don't you think 
Marie has a great figure, Dan?" Shana asked.
     "Fantastic," he said. "Sometimes I wish she wasn't my sister 
or a kid."
     "Some kid," Shana said. "When I grow up, I want to have a bod 
like that `kid'!" Then sports report came on and Dan made us all 
shut up while he listened to how his damn ol' Mets had lost to the 
Dodgers. After the news came the late show -- Forbidden Planet. 
Shana had to get up at six for her job at the Five & Dime. She gave 
Dan a peck on the cheek and said good-night and admonished Irene 
and I not to stay up too late. Then she went upstairs to bed. I 
heard her washing up and then I heard the door to her room close 
and lock. I went to the kitchen and got more pop.
     I made sure to walk in front of the TV and sit up on the floor 
at an angle. After a few minutes, Irene said, "Marie, you better 
move. I can see right through that gown in the TV light. And so can 
Dan."
     "Oh, don't worry," I said, never taking my eyes off the TV. 
"He's my step-brother and I'm just a kid. He probably doesn't even 
notice."
     "I notice."
     "I noticed you noticed," Irene chipped in. I looked this time, 
when Irene started to giggle. Dan was blushing. He had another 
hard-on.
     "Irene!" I said.
     "You, too!" She pointed. I looked down. My nipples were hard 
and pointed and clearly so for being silhouetted. "Nice view."
     "I don't care who looks," I said. "It doesn't bother Dan."
     "Well, actually, it does."
     I turned and looked right at him. "Does it really?"
     He nodded. "And you know it."
     Irene suddenly made a great show of yawning. "Well, I'm going 
to hit the hay. See ya in the morning!" She gave Dan a big wet kiss 
right on the lips, holding his face with her hands and making the 
kiss longer than it should have been, and then she went upstairs, 
too.
     I was still staring at Dan. "Want me to move?"
     He nodded. I was starting to think my plan had a chance, after 
all.
     I stood  and took my time walking toward him, staying between 
the TV and him. His eyes were on my tits. "That was some good night 
kiss."
     "Yes."
    "I can top  that." I bent at the waist and watched his eyes 
follow my tits as the nighty drooped and gave him a good  view.  
Then  I duplicated Irene's action: I took his face in my hands and 
kissed him on the lips. And -- maybe -- added a wrinkle of my own 
by pressing at his lips with my tongue until he finally let it in. 
By the time I drew my lips away, I was dripping wet and wondered if 
he could smell my juices. I kissed him again and this time took his 
hands and led them to me, till he was cupping my tits.
     He started to fondle my breasts -- and suddenly pulled his 
hands away and pushed me gently away.
     "Don't," he said. "This is wrong."
     "I want -- "
     "It's still wrong, to me."
     I stood in front of him. "But you want me, I know you do."
     He nodded. "A lot. And doubly because -- well, you know."
     "Know what?"
     He changed the subject abruptly: "That was you watching 
Dorothy and me, wasn't it?"
     "You knew?"
     He looked at me as if the question was stupid. I countered: 
"Well, I won't leave you all frustrated."
     He groaned softly. "Dammit, Marie, don't tempt me like this. I 
want us to be friends."
     "And we can't be friends and do that, too?"
     "You know we can't."
     I looked down at him. His dick was sticking up like a tent 
pole inside his jeans. His breathing was shallow and fast. His lips 
had been sweet and I kept thinking what it would be like to have 
him mouthing my breasts the way he'd been doing it with Dorothy and 
I was terribly annoyed, because I knew that when Dan dug in his 
heels, nothing was going to move him.
     "Damn you!" I hissed and stalked upstairs. I sat in the 
bathroom for a long time, trying to calm down, then I took a hot 
bath and masturbated like crazy. It didn't help enough.
     Finally, sometime around one, I went and crawled onto the 
mattress in the middle of the floor in Irene's room. I slept, 
frustrated and horny. But not soundly.
     Which was why I woke when Irene got up. I could almost get 
back to sleep, so I lay there quietly and tried to will sleep. 
After a while, I realized she hadn't come back to bed and there was 
no noise in the bathroom.
     I got up to investigate. All the other doors -- to Shana's 
room and her brother's room and my aunt and uncle's room -- were 
closed on the second floor. So I crept quietly down the stairs. The 
TV was still on, the sound very low. The TV was the only source of 
light in the room. It was enough. There were plants on a little 
opening in the stairwell and I peered between the leaves. My tan 
and dark complexion helped, too. Natural born commando, that was 
me.
     Irene was sitting next to Dan on the floor in front of the 
couch. She had some crackerjacks in one hand. The bowl was on the 
other side of Dan from her. She was looking at his crotch and he 
was looking at her face. I could just hear what they were saying as 
Forbidden Planet was getting close to the end.
     "Why do you keep touching me there, Irene?" Dan said. "You 
wouldn't like it if I was always touching you there."
     She shrugged and munched her Crackerjacks. "I like it. Don't 
you? Timmy likes it, all the time. I touch him lots of ways."
     "What ways?"
     She swallowed the last of her confection. "Promise you won't 
tell and I'll show you."
     He hesitated a long time. I could see his cock throbbing 
inside his jeans. Finally, he nodded. "Promise."
     She slowly put her hand over his dick-bulge and then and 
unzipped his jeans. She reached inside and fished out his dick. It 
stood straight up. She gripped it tightly in her little hand and 
jerked a little on it.
     His breathing got shallower. "You can touch me, too, y'know," 
Irene said, leaning over and staring up intently into his face. Her 
hair was all disheveled and sun-blonde and her face was cute, but 
very sensual. Her eyes said she knew exactly what she was doing. 
"Please?"
     She turned sideways, kneeling spread-legged next to him. She 
took his hand and led it between her legs, under her nighty. I knew 
when he began caressing her, because her eyes half closed and her 
mouth opened a bit.
     She bent and licked the head of his cock and he groaned 
softly. She kept licking and jerking and then she stiffened and I 
knew he was sliding his finger into her little slit. Her skinny 
young hips began hunching up and down. She released his cock and 
unfastened his pants, He lifted his butt as she pulled them down 
his thighs. He kicked them off the rest of the way, because her 
hands had gone back to his dick and his balls. She opened her mouth 
and took the head of his prick inside and I watched him again lift 
his hips and heard him murmur, "Damn, damn, damn..."
     She took his other hand and led it to the front of her 
nightgown. He searched for and found her nipples and rubbed them, 
then moved his hand to her head and caressed her face. She opened 
her mouth and spread her lips wide to take more of his thick cock 
in her mouth. She had soft, full lips, but she was small and her 
mouth was small for her face and she had it filled with just the 
head of his cock.
     She began bobbing her head up and down on him, still jerking 
with one small hand. She shifted back to get her face lower over 
him. The girl was young, but she definitely knew how to suck cock 
and  she
definitely was enjoying herself. Dan was arching toward her.
     "I'm gonna -- gonna -- "
     "Mmm-HMMM!" It was muffled, but definitely affirmative. She 
reached down with her other hand and began caressing his balls -- 
of which I had a great view -- and then he started to cum.
     She sucked and gurgled and swallowed and he came for what 
seemed a long time. She was utterly intent on sucking and drinking 
him.  I couldn't even feel jealous -- just envious. She was jerking 
with her hand harder and faster and I watched her little cheeks 
concave and bloat and saw her throat work as she swallowed. He came 
a lot and some slipped out around her lips, lubricating her hand on 
his shaft.
     Finally, his spasms became irregular and then slowed and then 
stopped. She sucked his limpening dick in and pushed it partially 
out of her mouth rapidly, like a little kid playing with a piece of 
spaghetti. He sank back to the floor and groaned, deep and 
relieved.
     She let his prick slide out of her mouth and it flopped 
between his legs. Her lips were all slick and spermy, and so was 
his cock. He pulled her up to him and cuddled her close, but she 
was having none of that. She pulled her nightgown up over her head 
and jammed one enormously swollen nipple into his mouth. He took it 
greedily, licking it and maybe even chewing a little on it.
     Irene sighed and pulled his hand back between her legs. Her 
ass was so tiny and her body was so lean and smooth! It was all 
glistening with perspiration and she looked slippery and sinuous as 
an eel -- a sexy young eel. He reached back and squeezed her 
cheeks, then slid his fingers back and caressed her little, smooth 
cunt. Finally, he extended Badfinger and she settled happily onto 
it and jerked her hips up and down. I could see his cock re-
erecting. In no time at all, it was hard again, solid as a brick 
and looking just as thick compared to her lithe slenderness.
     She murmured something to him I couldn't hear. His reply was 
audible: "But I'm afraid of hurting you."
     She said something that was obviously reassuring and shifted 
so she was straddling him. "First, I want this," he said. His hands 
came around and cupped -- and covered -- her ass. He guided her 
until she was standing over him, with his head resting back against 
the couch and then he began to eat her.
     Now I was definitely jealous, because from the way he ate her, 
I knew she was getting it good. He licked and sucked and nibbled 
and mouthed and tongued her. I watched her ass clench and her hips 
hunch and I watched her thighs shake as she came and came again. I 
could see her juices on his chin. He worked his hands around her 
farther and slid one finger against the back of her cunt and she 
shook above him. He worked the finger of another hand between those 
tightly squeezed, corded masses of hard little ass and she pushed 
back and against it, taking it into her teeny butt-hole to the 
first joint. I saw her tense until every muscle in her back was 
clearly defined and great beads of sweat popped out all over her 
body and she came again. Finally she couldn't stand and he lowered 
her against him. She sobbed into his shoulder and shivered again as 
he caressed her back and kissed her forehead. She said something to 
soft for me to hear.
     -- and I heard him say, incredulously, "Never? No one? But you 
taste so sweet, how can anyone resist?"
     "The same way you resist Marie." That was clear enough. My 
eyes widened, and there was no one to see them.
     He looked troubled for a moment, but then she was sliding down 
until her little cunt was nestled against the throbbing thickness 
of his glans. She eased herself up and reached down in her crouch 
to spread her labia and then she slowly worked her cunt onto the 
knob.
     "Damn that feels good, cousin Dan!"
     She worked her way down onto him, impaling herself on my step-
brother's solid dick. It stretched her little cunt a lot, and she 
really seemed to be enjoying it. She was very wet, and when she'd 
taken it all and began raising herself up again, his emerging cock 
was shining brightly in the light of the television.
     She levered herself up and down, faster and faster, groaning 
and sighing as he panted: "You're so tight and hot -- Ahhhh!"
    I watched him  move one hand out of sight, on her front to 
nipple height. She jammed herself down and shook against him, 
vibrating those narrow, prepubescent hips over him. His balls 
started to jerk. Then he moved his hand lower and twisted his arm 
and I guessed: He was moving his thumb over her clitoris. She shook 
faster and harder and then held herself still against him and 
quietly shrieked her pleasure. His balls pulled up tight and 
throbbed and I could see her cunt lips stretch and thin around his 
fat prick as it swelled with each spurt. She grabbed his face and 
kissed him hard and long as he came in her and she came with him.
     They collapsed together and lay like that for a long time. She 
pulled her little cunt off his cock slowly and then put her nighty 
back on.
     "Promise you won't tell?"
     "No one," he vowed.
     She giggled. "Can we do it again -- soon?"
     "I hope so, Irene. That  was terrific." He pulled himself 
upright and slid back into his jeans. "But not tonight."
     She giggled again. "Y'know, Marie wants to do that with you."
     He nodded as he sat  heavily on the couch and ad on the 
television began touting the great deal at Bender's Buick on Alexis 
Road. "I'd like to do it with her, too, but I can't."
     "Why not? You're not blood relations any more than you and I 
are."
     "Because she's special, in a different way. Some day we'll 
need to be able to talk to each other in a special way and this -- 
"He nodded toward her and the place where they'd fucked." -- would 
get in the way. I'm not sure why, but I don't think it's a good 
idea."
     "Well, if you'd rather do it with me than with someone with a 
bod like hers, that's not a problem for me!" She was positively 
glowing. She gave him a big kiss and I took that as my cue to go 
into fake slumber mode where they both figured I should be: On the 
mattress in Irene's room.
     I had a lot to think about. For one thing, I'd just watched my 
little -- in every sense of the word -- cousin do everything but 
rape my step-brother. And she'd enjoyed it as much as she'd 
confided she enjoyed fucking. And I'd just heard her put in a pitch 
on my behalf! And I'd just heard Dan tell her what he'd never told 
me: Some of the reason why he kept restraining himself and me from 
getting it on.
     I didn't mean to, but I dozed off pretty fast and resented 
waking in the sunlit morning. No matter. I did. Irene never told me 
of her escapade with Dan and I couldn't very well ask, could I?      
Dan and Dorothy never got together again -- she kept putting him 
off, the fool -- and the Fourth came and went and then so was he, 
back to his city and his girlfriends there. I was left with 
memories and fantasies and questions. I sort of coasted through the 
rest of the summer, developing just as fast as I before. It seemed 
like only a few days before school began.
     School. My freshman year in high school. I remember it vividly 
-- because that was the year the stolen pictures and the shots 
taken by Ed Sautter came back to haunt me and hurt me more than I 
had been hurt since -- well, since the first time.
     [Later. I promise.]

CHAPTER 11

     I spent most of the rest of the summer getting even with Dana 
and Irene and -- most of all -- Dan...in my mind. I fucked everyone 
I could and with the figure I had, I could get just about anyone I 
wanted. And I wanted a lot. Just before Labor Day, I hitched a ride 
out to Perrysburg with three Mexicans. I was so dark and swarthy 
that they assumed I was Mexican and were surprised that I didn't 
understand their Spanish. Only one of them spoke English and he 
wasn't very good with it. None of them was more than eighteen. I 
was wearing a bandeau under a tee-shirt and a pair of shorts and 
this goofy straw hat. It was really hot -- about ninety degrees and 
there was no breeze. They were riding in an old junker of a Rambler 
that didn't have a good muffler in it.
     The one who spoke English asked me how old I was. When I told 
him I was fourteen -- lying by two years -- and he translated, 
there was some muttering from the others.
     "We are unhappy. We believed you to have more years." He 
seemed genuinely sad.
     Well, I could understand the mistake. I measured 29-19-26 and 
would have worn a C cup if there'd been such a thing in a bra that 
size. I was taut and smooth and with my hair long and tousled, I 
could easily pass for older. So I said that was no reason to be sad 
and he said, Yes, it was, because they had thought I might like to 
have some fun, but I was too young.
     Now, I'd always heard stories and bad jokes -- What's a 10-
year-old Mexican virgin? A girl who can outrun her brothers -- and 
politely tried to explain I'd thought 14 was not too young for a 
girl to have fun, if she was Mexican.
     They were unhappy at that. Every one of them had brothers and 
sisters my "age" and younger and they were very proud that their 
sibs -- [Siblings. Am I going too fast for you?
     [Yeah, I know. I'm just feeling kind of bitchy and edgy. 
Ready?]
     Well, they were proud that their little brothers and sisters 
were pure and went to church regularly.
     I turned and looked at the two in the back and then again at 
the one in the front and said, I like to have fun, I have been 
having fun for a long time and would they like have some fun with 
me?
     We want to an old maintenance shanty near the rail yards. 
They'd adopted it and fixed it up as best they could with no money 
and had turned it into a kind of club house. It was clearly 
bachelor -- covered with pinups from Playboy -- but it was neat and 
clean and they were polite and solicitous.
     I didn't get to Perrysburg. I stayed there with them for about 
five hours. They were young, they were horny and they were 
incredibly virile. I had each of them three or four times. One of 
them -- the oldest -- wanted to try me in the ass, but as soon as I 
told him it was hurting, he stopped, apologized and withdrew. 
Oddly, though they were fascinated by nearly hairless pussy, none 
of them would eat me. Which was okay, as it turned out, because 
they had a good-natured contest of seeing who could make me cum the 
most often just by fucking. [I forget. No -- wait: I won.]
     They took turns, and they only time anyone was at all rough 
was when they touched my tits. Even then, it wasn't that they were 
mauling me; all three worked as day laborers and had very rough and 
calloused hands. One of the pinups on the wall was Gwen Wong, this 
Playmate with huge tits and long nipples and a very young face. One 
of the guys said that if my eyes were slanted, I could look a lot 
like her. The other two protested that I was prettier. And we 
fucked some more.
     I was sore for three days, but never regretted it.
     Then school started, my freshman year, and it was inevitable 
that I'd be invited to try out for cheerleader. I had no interest 
in that, though, and my refusal caused some resentment. The only 
extracurriculars -- official extracurriculars, that is -- I wanted 
anything to do with were gymnastics (which wouldn't have me because 
my figure was too pronounced for exhibition in a leotard) and the 
school paper.
     The school paper was a joke. We couldn't print anything the 
school didn't like or anything unpleasant. It was more of a pep 
sheet than anything else. We did personality profiles on the 
administration's favorites, the good examples -- never on the 
interesting students or activities. Still, it was fun to have 
official permission to go up to strangers and ask nosy questions.      
I wasn't seeing George anymore, of course, as he'd told me about 
meeting his distant cousin and they were mad for each other and 
that was that. We remained friends. But I didn't have a steady and 
satisfying boyfriend, not like George, and I was still trying to 
work the summer's non-events with Dan out of my head. So I was 
trolling.
     The problem was that in such a strictly supervised 
environment, I had to be very careful with my schoolmates. Since 
the town was already starting to split over the Vietnam War 
protests, the cops were enforcing the old curfew laws on kids under 
sixteen, so I couldn't just go and hang out much, either.
     Then the campaigns started for class presidents. I did a 
couple of interviews and heard the usual crap from all the 
candidates. Even the one who was being drafted. He didn't really 
want the job or the nonsense that went with it, but time and again 
he'd been the one to come up with innovative ideas for persistent 
problems and twice he'd successfully mediated disputes -- once, 
over an antiwar protest and once over race.
     But after the interview was over, he said something that 
really got my interest.
     "One thing I'd suggest would be giving class credit for 
volunteer work." I took out my notebook but he stopped me. His name 
was Tyrell Hamilton, he was six feet tall and handsome and well-
spoken and about the shade of Mom's coffee after she added a 
tablespoon of milk.
     "Don't bother," he said. "They'll never let you print it. And 
they'll never go along with it when I suggest it."
     I kept the notebook out. I was taking Gregg Shorthand and 
doing real well with it. [Yes. And I brought it. See? And these are 
verbatim notes.]
     "Why do you think it's important?"
     He laughed softly. "Because -- Look around you. Eight hundred 
students. About three dozen aren't white. Maybe a hundred don't 
come from middle- or upper-class homes. All Catholic. We are so 
much alike here that we have no idea how the rest of Toledo lives."
     "You think we need more integration, is that it?" I was a 
little suspicious.
     "Not racial integration," he said. "Social integration. The 
only reason there aren't more Afro-Americans here is there aren't 
more Afro-Americans who have the money and the academic 
qualifications. The nuns and the other students here generally 
don't give a damn about that."
     "There're exceptions."
    "There're always  exceptions." We were walking slowly down the 
first floor corridor toward the parking lot. The place was almost 
empty. From far, far away I could hear the echoes of cheerleading 
practice and someone was dribbling a basketball. "But even there, 
we're too much alike. The real world has poor people and rich 
people. It has Protestants and Jews and atheists. It has Birchers 
and antiwar activists. It has bigots. It has thieves and muggers 
and bums and saints."
     "We'll meet them soon enough."
     He held the door for me. "That's my point. We get out of 
school here and about half go to college and some go into the army 
and some move away, but we all meet the real world -- and we don't 
have the faintest idea how to deal with it. We meet people who are 
fundamentally different and it scares us and we get uptight and we 
don't react well. And they don't react well to us."
     "So it feeds on itself."
9[.....................................................]0110
     We were in the middle of the nearly empty parking lot. He 
spun, his eyes bright and his face animated. "Yes! And the hatred 
and suspicion and fear takes charge -- and all because we're 
inexperienced: We have no education in people!"
     "And you think encouraging supervised volunteer work would 
help us get some experience with different people in different 
situations."
     "Within the context of a goal-oriented guidance system and 
with the benefit -- "
     " -- of more experienced leaders who can teach us how to 
evaluate and respond -- "
     " -- to unfamiliar and sometimes frightening circumstances! 
Yes!"
     "And then, when we go into the real world, we understand a 
little more, because we've already tested ourselves in strange 
waters -- "
     "-- and found that we can swim, because we learned to do it --"
     " -- in a school?" I groaned at the pun.
     "Sounds fishy?" he asked innocently.
     "Holy mackerel."
     "No, it's 'Holy mackerel dere, Kingfish.'"
     "I guess I just don't have any soul."
     "But you're still one smart filly."
     I frowned.
     "Filly of soul?" he suggested.
     I groaned again.
     We both started laughing. Tyrell offered to drive me home. I 
didn't think twice. We talked more on the way. We really hit it 
off, instant chemistry, and it had started from the neck up, for a 
change.
     He let me out in front of my house and I waved good-bye. 
Inside, Jeanne was home, and Mom. Jeanne immediately pulled me into 
our room.
     "Marie, did you -- you know?"
     I stared at her. "What?"
     "Who was that?"
     I told her and she said, "Well, does he really have a big one? 
They say all of them have huge -- " The look on my face stunned 
her.
     "Jeanne, I interviewed him for the paper and he gave me a ride 
home."
     "You didn't do it with him?" "No -- though now that you 
mention it, it's not such a bad idea, I mean, he is awful good-
looking and ..."
     "Marie! He's a nigger!"
     I was the one who was stunned this time. How had we grown up 
together and been so close -- so very close -- without me knowing 
this about her? Because we never encountered anyone who was really 
different.
     "Jeanne, he's a man who's a little darker than me. A smart, 
polite, good-looking man. I think he and I might get to be friends. 
And don't you ever use that word in front of me again."
     She seemed a little shocked by that and I suppose I was, too. 
Socially conscious Marie -- as of about forty minutes before. But 
it was true. Something had happened to me during the time after the 
interview with Tyrell Hamilton. Something burned inside him and the 
flames had caught me, too. My main concerns had been getting laid, 
passing my class, getting laid, wondering when they were going to 
have a sale at Penney's, getting laid and getting even with Dana 
and Irene. Suddenly, I was thinking about things that were in the 
far distant future, beyond the great dividing line of Graduation, 
beyond 1971, which was a date lost in tomorrow. Suddenly, I was 
thinking about things like responsibility and understanding and 
harmony.
     And I was spending a lot of time thinking about Tyrell. Well, 
was it true what they say?
     [Yes, I saw Blazing Saddles. Okay?]
     I started spending more and more time with the juniors and 
seniors than I already was -- which was a lot, since I found most 
of the kids who were my age were kind of backward. I started 
hanging out with the crowd Tyrell spent time with. And pretty soon, 
I was fairly regularly sitting next to him at our basketball games 
-- and thus having him drive me home.
     After the fifth game -- against Penta; we lost -- I got 
impatient. "Ty, aren't you ever going to ask me out?"
     We were at a grade-crossing, waiting for an endless freight to 
pass, down by East Broadway. He waiting about a three-count and 
turned his face toward me. "You have to be kidding."
     "Why?"
     "You're white and I'm not and you're not even 13 yet!"
     "So?"
     "Are you nuts? I'm almost eighteen!"
     "So? I want you, Ty."
     "So? That's statutory rape and considering that I'm not white, 
the police will probably fire five or six warning shots -- into the 
back of my little burr head!"
     "Ty! You know me! We're friends, for crying out loud."
     "And that's fine -- but that's it, girl." He watched me. "What 
the hell are you doing?"
     What I was doing, for the benefit of those who weren't there, 
was pulling my sweater off and unbuttoning my blouse.
     "Guess."
     "Marie!"
     The blouse was off and I was reaching back and under for the 
hooks on my ill-fitting bra. A moment later and it was gone, too, 
and not only did it feel good to have the constriction of my tits, 
it made me feel somehow wild and free to be sitting there with my 
boobs bare in his car so anyone could look in -- even in the dark -
- and see me.
     "Tyrell Leroy Hamilton, you will not be my first and you 
probably won't be my last and if you don't promise to make love 
with me I am going to jump out of this car and yell, 'Help! This 
nigger's trying to rape me!'"  "Marie, I want you."
     His words, so calm and easy and serious, froze me. "But you're 
trying to take charge of me and I won't have that. Be my friend and 
we may become lovers, some day -- but I won't have an owner for a 
friend or a lover."
     I hadn't thought of it that way. I started pulling my blouse 
back on. The caboose of the endless freight rumbled slowly by. 
Behind us, car engines were starting. I felt like a shit.
     "I'm sorry."
     He was shaking his head as the crossing gates came up and we 
started across the tracks.
     We drove across the tracks in silence. We drove down to East 
Broadway in silence. As we pulled up onto the road that would take 
us back to my house, I finally said, "Dammit, Ty, say something?"
     "You have truly amazing breasts. I didn't know they were so 
big or lovely."
     "I'd really like you to get more acquainted with them. And 
more."
     "Doesn't sound all bad. By the way ..."
     "Yes?"
    "Do  you know where we were parked when you threatened to get 
out and yell for help?"
     I thought about it -- and then it hit me.
     "Uh-huh," he said. "Niggerville. Jigaboo Town. You could have 
precipitated a race riot back there."
     I was glad for the night, so he wouldn't see me blushing in 
embarrassment. Then I noticed he'd driven right past the street 
where I lived. "Where?"
     "I want to show you something."
     I started to get my hopes up, but then I remembered what he 
was like and calmed down, fast. And with cause.
     Ty drove us down past the Anderson grain elevators and parked. 
It was dark there. He got out and a moment later I did, too. We 
were looking across the Maumee River and had a really lovely view 
of the water and downtown Toledo.
     "It's awfully pretty," I said.
     "Until you get there," he  said. "Until you get down on 
Washington and Jefferson. Go by the Valentine or the Blade or to 
one of the Purple Cows. Then it's just as ugly."
     We were standing close. I pulled his arm around me. It felt 
good.
9[.....................................................]0110
     "People can be like that, too. Beautiful and impressive till 
you get up close and then you see them for what they are and see 
all the ugly things in them."
     I moved till I stood in front of him and pulled his other arm 
around me. I covered his hands with mine and held them across my 
breasts.
     "I've been close to you, Ty. I am close to you. I don't see 
ugly."
     "I -- I've done bad things."
     I kept my mouth shut.
     "I hurt  someone. Hurt bad. Someone who shouldn't have been 
hurt."
     I held his hands tight over my tits. And listened. It had 
happened when he was fourteen and hanging out with other kids his 
age. All of them were black, kids he knew in Niggerville. One of 
them knew this girl who was just asking for it. She was lithe and 
lean and tight and had a great ass and the way she talked and 
acted, they knew she was just asking for it and they knew that if 
someone gave her some wine, she'd do them all.
     So someone gave her some wine. And she did them all. Many 
times. Long past the end of the wine. Long past her willingness.
     "I'd never been with anyone before and even when she was 
crying and asking us to stop, we kept doing it."
     Except him. He'd persuaded the others to stop and let her go.
     "That sounds like good to me, not bad," I said.
     "It was -- but it wasn't the end."
     A few months later, she came by his house when he was home 
alone. She'd been drinking wine. She'd gone into that phase when a 
girl just suddenly blossoms. She wasn't a skinny kid with a great 
ass, not any more. She was a young siren, blooming. And she wanted 
to thank him.
     "I should've made her go away."
     But he hadn't. They'd spent the entire afternoon, before his 
parents or siblings came home, fucking wildly. He figured he must 
have cum in her four or five times. Whenever he got limp, she did 
things -- "With her mouth." -- to make him ready again...and at 
fourteen-almost-fifteen he could get ready a lot. "That's not 
hurting someone," I told him.
     "Yes it was. I wanted to do it more with her and when she 
wanted more wine, I let her have it from Momma's closet so I could 
do it more."
     The problem came a couple of months later. "One of the guys 
said she was dead."
     I went cold all over when he said that. "Dead?" She'd gotten 
pregnant and gone to the only abortionist a poor thirteen-year-old 
girl -- black or white -- in Toledo could find in those moral, 
enlightened days. That night, she'd begun hemmorhaging. She was DOA 
at St.Charles.
     "I killed her."
     I turned to him. His arms dropped away as soon as I released 
his hands. "That's not true."
     He was nodding, tear-stained cheeks glimmering in the night. 
"Me. I got her pregnant and -- and -- "
     "And you were the only guy she ever fucked?"
     He blinked.
     "Yeah -- fucked." I said it hard.
     "Well, no, of course not, but -- "
     "You figure you're the only guy who fucked her that month?"
     He tried to turn away. I grabbed him, my arms around his 
waist.
     "Well?"
     "I -- I -- "
     "You know you weren't. Hell, she was probably fucking another 
guy that day -- the same one who gave her the wine before she got 
to your house."
     "But what I did was wrong -- "
     "She wanted it, didn't she? She went out of her way to ask for 
it? She wanted to keep doing it? And you figure it's your fault?"
     "She was just a kid!"
     "So were you."
     "So are you."
     "I'm young, but I haven't been a kid since ... " I almost told 
him, but couldn't. "Well, I'm no kid."  I pulled his arms around 
me. "Hold me."
     And that's what he did -- just held me, close and strong and 
scared and sobbing and trying to fight it all back, trying to be 
the tough young buck, figuring this so-called white girl --      
[Cause it's true. Put my hand down on a piece of paper -- here. 
See? Do I look "white" now? Right. You do it -- see? Kind of off-
beige. What gets called "black" isn't really black. When was the 
last time you saw someone dark enough to even try to qualify for 
"black"?
     [Yeah, I thought so. So you think about this: Those aren't 
colors or races or hues, they're just the fucking labels we use so 
we can generalize or categorize and excuse ourself from thinking 
any farther than the label. [Okay? Your goddam right I'm hot about 
it! Want to find out why? Listen.]
     -- this so-called white girl wouldn't figure him out, but I 
did, because when you're that close, there's no color, no race, 
just holding and being held, and I have a news flash for all the 
racial purity folks: We're all the same. The reason I know is that 
holding Ty, I could see through him just like anyone else. He was 
just looking to stop hurting, same as me and you and anyone else. 
Hurting doesn't have a race, unless the race is Human.
     Well, one thing led to another and before long I was doing 
more than holding. His was the first uncircumcized cock I'd ever 
held or sucked or fucked, and when he came, he groaned and he 
cried, and I understood that. He was crying cause there was nothing 
left in him that he hadn't shared, so I held him till the sun came 
up and we never talked about that -- but something had been 
established, a bond, you know? We never did anything sexual again.
     I sneaked into the house and -- Miracle of miracles -- no one 
caught me. I took that as a Sign.
     I lay awake for a long time, thinking that this was amazing -- 
knowing even then we weren't going to be lovers again -- that this 
afro senior and me were that close that we'd used fucking and 
sucking and loving to seal our bond, and it felt right. Damn, but 
if felt good and close and tight.
     But no way that was going to be left alone. No way. The weeks 
passed and about ten days before the class elections, I went over 
to room 128, which was the room Ty's backers had drawn from the 
pool as a campaign headquarters. I went over there pretty much 
every day and it was more and more crowded, which was a good sign.      
When I walked in, the place went quiet. Everyone was looking at me. 
I said Hello to a few people and looked around, but Ty wasn't in 
sight and when I asked Chuck -- who had sort of fallen into 
managing the campaign -- where Ty was, he just shrugged and said he 
had to go. The same thing happened with the next four people I 
asked.
     Pretty soon, I was alone in that room. It felt like a 
mortuary.
     I called his house and they told me he wasn't home yet, so I 
left my name and number. When he hadn't called back, I called again 
at nine-thirty and they told me he'd gone to bed early because he 
wasn't feeling well.
     I didn't see him around school the next day, a Thursday, but I 
did notice that some of his mimeographed campaign posters were 
missing. I knew he worked after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
and I knew where, so I hitched a ride out to the shopping center to 
discount store where he was a stock clerk. When I saw his battered 
old junker in the parking lot, I felt better -- whatever was going 
on, Ty was not too sick or hurt to go to work.
     I found him in the back of the store, unloading boxes of 
toasters from the back of a truck pulled right up to the loading 
dock. There were two other guys working with him. One of them 
noticed me and said something and the other turned and muttered 
something to Ty. The two other guys were staring at my tits -- I 
was wearing a tank top, but they were still too big to hide. Ty saw 
me, took a deep breath and told the other guys he was going to take 
a short break.
9[.....................................................]0110
     I followed him off the loading dock and we went back to stand 
near the trees that lined the truck road behind the store.
     "What's going on, Ty? I went to 128 to find you and -- "
     "I'm withdrawing from the election."
     "What? Why?"
     "And we can't be together any more."
     "What the hell -- "
    "That's all there  is to it." He started to walk away but I 
grabbed his arm and jerked him back toward me.
     "Like hell it is. You tell me what's going on and you tell me 
now!"
     "It doesn't matter -- "
     "It does to me!"
     So then he took an envelope from his pocket and from the 
envelope he took the photographs and held them out to me. I 
recognized the top two; they'd been missing from George's basement 
workshop. I didn't recognize the others, because I'd never seen 
them. But I knew when they were taken.  There I was laying on my 
back, sucking a huge cock with a dripping, open pussy right over my 
face. I was stunned, but managed to say, "I don't get it."
     "If I run in the election, I'll win. If I win, these photos -- 
and some films, I was told -- start making the rounds. You'll be 
ruined. Your family will be ruined."
     "Who -- "
     "I don't know. There was a letter with the pictures. No return 
address, no signature. It just said quote that if a nigger won the 
school election, his white cunt was going to be the famous 
underaged piece of ass in the state of Ohio unquote."
     "They're bluffing."
     He snorted. "I don't think so. And I don't know how they found 
out what we did unless someone -- like you -- told them."
     "I didn't tell a soul! And who told all the people in 128 it 
was my fault?"
     He handed me the envelope. It was addressed to Chuck. I felt 
my guts go icy and I thought for a minute I was going to be sick.  
Ty was right. They weren't bluffing. And I knew who they were, too. 
And he was right about us not being together again. "I'm so sorry, 
Ty. I'm so -- " I couldn't say anything else, so I just shook my 
head and ran away from him, crying.
     I walked all the way home, about six miles, and didn't get 
there till past dark. Mom was pissed off, but by the time I got 
home, she wasn't nearly as pissed off as I was and when I told her 
that this wasn't the time to start with me, she got the message and 
turned into superMom, wanting to know if I wanted to talk about it. 
I told her I had to work it out for myself.
     And that's what I did. I figured it out for myself. Ed Sautter 
had stolen the photos from George's workshop and he had sent the 
hate mail and blackmail threat. It didn't seem likely that he'd 
done it alone, either. That kind of racist is a coward and can 
never do anything alone. They always have to have a half-dozen or 
so people helping them, usually hiding their faces.
     I called Roger the next day and told him what had happened. I 
asked him if Ed couldn't get in trouble with the law for having 
that stuff in his house. He explained about search warrants and 
said he'd ask a buddy on the State Police. When he called me back, 
he said Sautter could make a stink and drag a lot of stuff out in 
court, if it got to court. But, he said, his pal had told him there 
was someone else who'd be interested and if I wanted, Roger would 
take care of it.
     He wouldn't tell me anything else. He told me I'd have to 
trust him. I finally agreed to let him take care of it. I didn't 
hear anything else for about three days, during which time the Ty-
less election came and went.
     The Toledo Blade story reported that the coroner had ruled it 
an accident. Sautter had apparently been taking drugs and stumbled 
into the pool, striking his head on the edge as he fell. His 
roommate found him floating, in the morning. He hadn't heard 
Sautter return from his business meeting with three men in a black 
Lincoln. The roommate thought Sautter had sold much of his 
photography equipment to the men, because Sautter and two of the 
men had pretty well cleaned out his darkroom. The police said more 
than thousand in cash had been found in Sautter's pocket, so they 
gave the story credence. The roommate and Sautter's girlfriend were 
so shaken by the tragedy, said the newspaper, that they were going 
to leave the area and try to start their lives over. Their exact 
destinations were undecided.
     Years later, of course, I figured out who Roger had called and 
why they'd been so persuasive. After all, Ed was cutting into their 
territory by making porno films. And he was jeopardizing their 
whole business because citizens tend to get outraged at all porno 
films when something involving minors get into distribution, even 
willing minors.
     At the time, though, the only thing that puzzled me was who 
had let on to what Ty and me had done that long, weeping night. I 
was mooning around the house, all morose and sad because of how 
good I'd imagined we could be together -- a luxury I could indulge 
because we hadn't been together long enough for all the normal 
hassles and irritations to mar the dream -- and I'd sort of fixated 
on figuring out who had spilled the beans. Maybe Ty had told one of 
his friends and he'd said something? That didn't seem like Ty. Or 
had we been seen? Who?
     I found out by an accidental, chance remark. Jeanne was a year 
behind me and still going to the prison school. Her eighth-grade 
class had been treated to a one-day photography workshop run by 
guess which guest teacher? You got it. He noticed the similarity in 
names, asked her after the class, pumped her for information about 
me and tried -- and failed -- to talk her into posing for him.      
"When I told him you were always with Ty, he got all red in the 
face, but he said he was okay, so I didn't think anything about 
it."
     But he had. And it had led to his death, to Ty's not running 
in a school election he would surely have won -- and all the good 
things that might have come of that -- and, not incidentally, to 
breaking my heart. She hadn't had the least idea the damage she was 
doing. Hell, I would have told him as much, myself. But very 
innocently and openly, she'd done something that caused me to hurt 
like I'd only hurt once before. [I promise. I'll tell you...later.]
     I sort of withdrew from everything after that. I quit the 
school paper and really buckled down to the books. I didn't have a 
social life, except for one weekend I stayed out with Charlene (and 
actually spent most of the time naked, with Roger). My grades 
soared and I discovered the library and then I discovered Jane 
Austin and Emily Bronte and, finally, Colette. I turned into a 
bookworm. Mom was ecstatic. Jeanne was puzzled. Dad was...well, he 
was Dad. Even Alexis the Pure was impressed. I started writing 
letters to my phantom step-brother, some of which I even mailed and 
he wrote back. Then I joined Pen Pal and started writing to kids 
around the world. It passed the time. The endless Toledo gray 
winter came and went and then it was spring and I took to reading 
in the park, when I could. I found myself spending most of what 
little social time I had with freaks -- so-called, because in those 
days, you were either a Freak or a Straight -- who were the only 
ones (besides nerds) who read books for pleasure.      In May of 
'68 I met Terrence Molonari and his twin, older brothers, while I 
was hitching to Navarre Park for a -- don't laugh -- poetry 
reading. I never got to the poetry reading.
