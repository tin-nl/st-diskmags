 CAMERONE

This is the big day in the Legion calendar and commemorates their 
greatest battle fought in Mexico on 30 April 1863. In this battle 
sixty legionnaires held off a force of two thousand Mexicans, half 
of whom were mounted cavalry, in a fight to the death.

The story of the battle of Camerone goes something like this:

     When Maximilian, the new Emperor of Mexico, landed in that 
country in May 1864, the military position was that a French force, 
consisting of about forty thousand Europeans, held Mexico City and 
a corridor from it to the sea at Vera Cruz. Opposed to this was the 
Mexican leader, Juarez, who with some twenty thousand troops 
continually harassed French activity, persistently attacking supply 
lines along the corridor coming to and from the capital city. At 
the beginning of April 1863, two battalions of legionnaires had 
arrived to assist the French military forces.
Towards the end of the same month, an escort was needed for a 
convoy which was carrying bullion to French troops in the interior. 
The Third Company of the 1st Battalion was allocated to the task. 
Its effective marching force had been reduced to sixty-two 
legionnaires - the rest, including the officers, were sick with 
yellow fever. Three officers volunteered to go with the escort; 
they were Captain Danjou, Lt Vilain, the pay officer, and 2nd Lt 
Maudet. Danjou was a French officer of some experience who had 
fought in Italy, Algeria and the Crimea, where he had lost his left 
hand and he now wore a false one in its place.
News of the pending convoy of bullion filtered through to the enemy 
and the Mexican sector commander, Colonel Milan, began mustering a 
large force of guerrillas with the object of capturing it. Milan 
managed to assemble about two thousand men, eight hundred of whom 
were mounted cavalry armed with Remington and Winchester rifles. 
Early in the morning of 30 April, the 3rd Company set off along the 
corridor ahead of the convoy to ensure the way was clear. The 
company moved off in two platoons marching in extended lines, with 
Danjou in the centre with a couple of mules carrying rations. A 
small rear guard followed behind - French intelligence was poor and 
they had no idea that a large enemy force was watching their every 
move. Just before 7.00 a.m., Danjou's company passed through the 
deserted hamlet of Camerone, near a stream noted for its excellent 
crayfish. The hamlet consisted of a farmhouse and outbuildings, 
together with a few other ruined hovels, all enclosed in a 
courtyard. A mile or so past Camerone, Danjou called a halt for 
„casse-cro–te. Fires were made and coffee was boiled - it was never 
tasted, for at that moment Colonel Milan and his cavalry attacked. 
The legionnaires formed a square and prepared to meet the Mexicans 
in best Algerian fashion. They were caught in the open but, 
fortunately for them, it was not good cavalry country owing to the 
plentiful clumps of tropical vegetation and waist-high grass. 
Continuous volleys from the Legion rifles kept Milan at a distance 
and, unable to charge directly, he manoeuvred his men closer and 
began to surround the French company. Danjou, seeing the 
vulnerability of his boys caught in the open and appreciating the 
enemy strenght, decided to fight a running action back to the 
farmhouse at Camerone, over a mile away, and hold out there. His 
mules had broken loose in the first mˆl‚e and galopped off with 
rations and reserve ammunition, a fact which did not improve his 
prospects.
The legionnaires, in a wide square, began to move back to Camerone 
and as they moved Milan and his men sniped at their flanks. Moving 
painfully slowly through the tropical undergrowth, Danjou 
eventually made it to the farmhouse, arriving with a pitiful 
handful of forty-two men, many of whom were wounded. On arrival, 
they immediately set about improving the defences by barricading 
the openings and reinforcing the walls.
Up until this point Milan had only his cavalry with him, and it was 
towards 9.00 a.m., two hours after the action had started, that his 
three battalions of infantry arrived, comprising some twelve 
hundred men. Several charges and forays were tried by the Mexicans 
and, though repulsed, the legionnaires without food or water began 
to suffer. Towards eleven, the sun high in the sky poured down a 
fearsome heat and the continued volleys from rifle and musket began 
to take their toll.
Colonel Milan called on Danjou to surrender but he refused and made 
his men swear to fight to the end. Shortly afterwards the Mexicans 
penetrated the upper storey of the farmhouse and Danjou was shot 
through the head by a musket ball fired from the roof. Vilain took 
command and continued to direct the defence.
As time wore on and the Legionnaires fell, the enemy assaults 
became deadlier and more telling. The heat increased and the men 
were tortured with thirst. At 2.00 p.m., after seven hours of 
continued fighting under fantastic pressure, Vilain was killed and 
2nd Lt Maudet took command. Wave after wave of attack was launched 
and repulsed, but the final result was inevitable - yet still the 
survivors resisted.
Another call to surrender was yelled by Milan but he received words 
of defiance in return. The dead and dying now lay sprawled all over 
the courtyard; both legionnaires and Mexicans, with the stench of 
death and cordite in the nostrils and a thousand flies relishing 
the filth. They fought on through the long hot weary afternoon and 
at 5.00 p.m. Maudet was left with twelve men. The Mexicans fired 
the main farmhouse and Maudet and his men dashed across the 
courtyard to a last small outhouse. Again Milan called for 
surrender and again he was refused.
After a brief lull towards 6.00 p.m., the Mexicans infantry massed 
and moved slowly in - Maudet was left with himself and five others 
to fight. Seeing it was hopeless, he gave the order to load and 
fire, and then the final order to fix bayonets. Tearing aside the 
barricades, the six men charged into the mass of Mexican infantry 
and were completely absorbed by it. Yet by some miracle Colonel 
Milan was able to call a halt to the ultimate massacre. Three 
legionnaires survived the final charge. Milan appears to have been 
much impressed with the legionnaires and gave them their lives and 
allowed them to keep their rifles and bury their dead.
Danjou's wooden hand now rests in the Legion Hall of Honour in 
Aubagne. It is a symbol of Legion durability - for the Legion never 
surrenders.
Thus ended the battle of Camerone - Napoleon III ordered that the 
word 'Camerone' should be inscribed in gold on the walls of Les 
Invalides in Paris. Of all the scores of battles fought by the 
Legion, this is the one most highly regarded and celebrated 
annually with all the pomp and ceremony that the Legion can muster. 
Camerone day, 30 April, is without doubt the most important day in 
the Legion calendar.
