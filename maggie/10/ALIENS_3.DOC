        There's a very good advantage to living in the USA, all 
the great movies are released here first! A good example is that 
we got to see Terminator II several weeks before it was shown in 
europe.

        Well, yet another big name movie has hit the theatres, 
Aliens III. Yup, yet another aliens movie! Yet it was not a very 
big suprise. In the last installment "Aliens", they quite 
literally left the door open for a sequel, when the mother alien 
gets blown out of the airlock, and wasn't killed (?)

        The movie begins with Ripley crash-landing on a maximum 
security prison planet called "Fiorina 161". From the crash 
landing, only Ripley and Bishop survive, but the android admits 
"I'm not what I used to be". The planet is populated by a small 
crew of prisoners whose duty is to maintain a run-down 
underground ore refinery. The prisoners claim to have found God 
through their own religion spun from cultism and christianity.

        And yes, the "company" happens to show up as well, 
although it only plays a minor part in the movie. One 
interesting note, we learn that Ripley's full name is "Ellen 
Ripley", something which I don't think has been mentioned in 
either of the two previous movies.

        Well, what would the movie be without yet another Alien? 
Another Alien inexplicably happens to be carried to the prison 
planet along with Ripley, where it causes the usual terror and 
havoc. Despite the decent acting and occasionally clever 
dialogue (Ripley's dialogue to the Alien : "Don't be afraid, 
it's only me.. I'm part of the family now..") something seems to 
be seriously missing.

        Perhaps it's the fact that like Rambo XXVII and Rocky 
XXXIV, there's nothing really new in this movie. Yet again we 
find Ripley trying to convince the unbelievers that there is an 
alien with acid for blood lurking somewhere, which is going to 
be munching on humans like they are potato crisps, unless 
something is done. Haven't we seen this all before?

        Something else about the film - Ripley seems to be a bit 
tired, and the film seems the same way, dragging on for a bit 
and only really picking up at the end, where it then becomes 
difficult to follow the near-frenzied action.

        As typical of the Alien movies so far, the film is set 
in dark, dreary gloominess with plenty of slime, blood and gore 
to spice things up. There's the usual screaming, hissing, 
fountains of blood and gore, and other violence that is 
trademark of the Alien films.

        One interesting new effect we do see in the movie is a 
view from the Alien's perspective, most of the time running 
after the panicking humans. The damned bugger is so fast and can 
even run on the ceiling, so the view can sometimes be dizzying. 
Strange, I didn't know the Alien had eyes!

        Overall, there isn't anything unique or outstanding 
about the film, and unless you're a die-hard Alien fan (like 
me!), Sigourney Weaver fan, or are really into blood & gore, I 
can't really reccomend it.

        June 5th, yet another movie is coming out here in the 
USA, called "Patriot Games". It's supposed to be the sequel to 
"Hunt for red october" (which was a truly brilliant film!). And 
it stars Harrison Ford! Should be an excellent movie! Of course, 
I'll write up a review for the Maggie when I see it.

Here's how I would rate the 3 alien movies:

Alien    8       Suspenseful thriller, good storyline.
Aliens   10      Perfect blend of suspense and special effects.
Alien 3  6       A recap of the previous two. Nothing really new.

Question : There is an alien's egg that was laid in the 
spaceship, but I thought the mother alien tore off her egg-
laying-case back on the planet in order to follow Ripley to the 
Sulacco in "Aliens"?? How does one then explain how an egg got 
laid in the spaceship? And so near the hypersleep
chambers?

Name        : Alien 3
Group       : 20th Century Fox
Coding      : David Fincher
Graphics    : 8 (The typical neat effects, fountains of blood, etc.
                But there are no rasters or vector graphixx. And the
                only smooth scrolline is in the ending credits.)
Music       : 6 (No shitty 4-voice trackermuzak here!! Although it's
                in Dolby Stereo, the composition is lacking in
                originality, and is definitely NOT up to par with the
                previous Alien movies)
Originality : 5 (Nothing new here, unfortunately! The occasional
                witty dialogue and excess of blood & gore can't
               save this movie from a below average rating. „SIGH)
