
* The Eye of Brainwash Company *


Real name: Petri Kuittinen

Sex: Male (altough several people at school have claimed 
otherwise)

Home country: Finland (Yeah!)

Age: 20 (and I still haven't gone to driving school)

Height: 180 cm or 5 feet and 11 inches (a little bit taller than 
Brain!)

Weight: about 61 kg (that's about 134 lbs.)

Appearance: Thin. I have got brown spiky hair (which is usually 
a mess, because I rarely use a comb). I usually wear dirty eye 
glasses, blue jeans and a sweater or a T-shirt.   Personality: 
According to my friends, I'm very curious, and I've got strange 
thoughts and  I talk too much. I am also stingy and quite a 
coward, but I don't give up my opinion easily (I actually love 
to debate).
On the brighter side I am trustworthy and often quite funny 
(even if I don't try to be funny).

Hobbies: Mad thinking, coding, playing my synthetisizer and 
roleplaying (I play mostly REAL role playing games, not such 
stupid computer games as Dungeon Master etc. I am the game 
master of our group and we use my own roleplaying system called: 
The Unknown Worlds).

Normal position: Sitting crosslegged in front of my wrecked 520 
ST or lying in bed reading a book and eating corn flakes.

Favourite saying: Sielt{ ja syv{lt{, Paskat ( <- That was Finnish)

Motto: "Self made, best made." 

Favourite food: Lamers... (That was a joke)  ...As I already 
mentioned: just plain, ordinary, dry corn flakes. I eat them 
directly from 1kg sacks. I also like gingerbread cookies (I eat 
them round the year!). 

Favourite drink: Milk, orange juice, home made strawberry juice, 
hot water+ milk+honey (Yum!).

Favourite films: Aliens, Star Wars (the first part), Elephant 
Man, The Year of a Dragon, Gremlins I & II and many more.

Worst film: Stalker

Favorite TV-programs: Transformers, Blake's 7, L.A. Law, Twin 
Peaks and Married with children (The Bundy family). I also watch 
many environmental and political programs. 

Worst TV-program: Megavisa (That's one of those stupid TV-quizes)

Favourite girl: Samantha Fox

Music taste: I like classical music (Bach and Beethoven are my 
favourites), evergreens (!) and electronic music. I don't like 
modern jazz, rap (in my opionion it is not even music) or loud 
heavy music. I mostly listen to pure computer music via my TV's 
speakers (quite a shame that ATARI only has a lousy YM-2149 
sound chip!).

Favourite books: J.R.R.Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, The 
Hobbit; Clive Barker, The Great and Secret Show; Ian Banks, The 
Wasp Factory; Frank Herbert, Dyne I-III; Isaac Asimov, 
Foundation trilogy; Willian Golding, The Lord of Flies; Pentti 
Linkola, Johdatus 1990-luvun ajatteluun; Abacus, ST internals; 
(There also many other good books I haven't bothered to mention 
here).

History in a nutshell: I was officially born in Hanko, but the 
real place was Tammisaari. I later moved on elsewhere. Now I 
live in near Porvoo. My childhood was quite normal. I played a 
lot with Legos. I was harrassed at school by other kids. I have 
also hurt my head several times, so that explains why I am 
little crazy. Then I continued my studies in upper secondary 
school and got good grades. I got accepted to 2 universities. I 
am currently studying computer science in the Helsinki 
University of Technology (1st year, Masters degree).

What would I take with me to a deserted island: Sam Fox, food 
and a good calculator (which of course has solar panels) 

Future plans: I am going continue my studies in studies in HUT. 
I will be also working on data compressors.

Greatest dream: Immortality

Worst thought: Being totally paralyzed and unable to communicate.

Philosophy: Materialist (You might think this wrong. I'm not 
after loads of material things. I simply don't belive in 
supernatural or the existance of spritual world, soul, life-
after-death etc.)

Status in Brainwash Co.: Main coder, graphic artist, music maker and 
scrolling text writer.

Computers owned: Memotech MTX 512 (I regret selling it at 
ridicilous price) and of course two ATARI 520 STs (I was 
planning to buy an ATARI TT, but it cost too much). 

Current hardware: My junk 520 ST (which is from year 1985!), 2.5 
meg ATARI 520 ST, 1 one sided disk drive, 1 megafile 30 (hard 
disk), 2 double sided drives, ARCADE joystick, Commodore MPS 
1000-printer, SM 124 (black & white monitor), SHARP 14" color TV 
(I am also planning to buy a color monitor), Kawai PH-50 
keyboard, Korg Wavestation EX (synth) and hundreds of feet of 
cable. 

Favourite computer: Has not been invented yet. (Maybe the new 
Atari Falcon?).

Favourite games: Turrican II (I'm anxiously waiting for the 
Turrican III), Flood, Shufflepuck Cafe, Umoria 5.x, almost all 
Infocom games (I liked especially Lurking horror and 
Wishbringer) and Match It (by Delta Force!). 

Worst games: Brain has got a load of them, but he is going to 
sell them away.

Favourite programs: Devpac 2, Degas Elite, GFA-Basic, Quartet, 
Fastcopy Pro, Score Perfect Professional and Cubase.

Favourite demo crew: None 

Worst demo crew: All teams who have no originality, and can't 
code on assembler (too many to mention). 

Favourite demo: Braindead 1/2-megademo by me (If it will be ever 
ready) 

Worst demo: Skinny puppy (Aargh!)

Special message: Big hi to all "real" roleplayers!
