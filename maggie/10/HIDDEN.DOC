 A Patrick Cunt Presentation...!!!!

"Sex, Lies and shitty songwriting..."

What was Martika on about with her recent hit 'Martika's 
Kitchen'?? "Come on, come on, get some in Martika's kitchen.."

Get some …What!! I know she has been shacking up with 'Mr Midget 
Little Richard impersonator' PRINCE, but that is no excuse, does 
she mean get some sugar to go with the tea, or more likely, some 
low down raunchy doggy-fashion coupling with the waitresses!?!?! 
Be precise...

Talking about PRINCE, the truly amazing thing is that I have seen 
one of the jackets he took on tour, and it is no bigger than a 
normal persons forearm, it makes you wonder what the women see in 
this compressed person, if he has a mega hard on, does it not take 
away too much blood from elsewhere so he falls over... It is 
probably sadistic curiousity on the part of these woman, who like 
to watch someone turn very pale and faint immediately before 
sexual intercourse... What a bunch of horrible bitches!!

„Q):- How do you get one of those loud patterned check suits that 
all the 1970's American T.V. detectives (Exc Columbo,) used to 
wear?
„
A):- Take one bucket of vomit, and a fairly bad tailor!!!
„
Also,,

Q):- How do you get a perfect replica of Dominic 'Smoking Jacket 
and Darjeeling' Diamond, to present your new derivative "Computer 
Games Show" hastily produced to cash in on the success of 
„Gamesmaster ((This is one for TV producers only!!!))
„
A):- Take two buckets of vomit, and a slightly used Scottish 
accent..
„
A quick word to „Felice, I'm sorry I rewrote part of one of your 
articles, the problem is, that is is perfectly possible to get 
prosecuted under the Race Relations Act (1976, I think..) for some 
of what you wrote, I prefer prosecution under the „Obscene 
Publications Act Myself!!!„ 

.........Need some ideas soon, or this is going to be a short 
hidden article, It is interesting to note that Mad Vision DiscMag 
decided to put in the 'Terminator II script/book, as featured in 
'ST-News'?????? It is quite a revealing read, especially for 
someone called Ruthless, Definitely one for the committed or semi-
sane followers of the cracking community, their lives, fights and 
feuds (Ruthless again!!)

I tend to think that they are being optimistic, going for release 
of a second issue in July, (Take it from us, it aint that easy..  
To get Mike to do anything!!!) We look forward to the next issue, 
whenever (Sounds like Maggie..) I actually first wrote "We „loon 
forward" just now. Which may be a good motto in future, now can 
anyone do anything with "Robocup III, prbubly the besst game on 
thee STTTTT tu dayt???????"

…WE LOON FORWARD.....

I t'ink dat shuulld be "Leeen!" Buort waaat do oi Nnowwww...

I had that Leon O'Reilly in the front of my car once (Not 
literally..) Also in my liddle flat or apartment, and at the local 
Komputer Klubb last weekend.. I forget what Pseudonym he uses 
these days, something like "Mr Bootsectorcoder.." Is this total 
driv3el, shall I go away and drivel up one of the other articles, 
what a good idea....

This is what cider can do to a "normal" healthy Adult, this is a 
very bad thing indeed.... (The Surgeon General for stopping 
pleasurable things by government order..)
‚
Hidden article finishes rather abruptly SHOCK HORROR....
