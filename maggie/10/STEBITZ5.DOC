  Hanging's too good for him. I hear them say,
„   I have to agree because, perhaps it is too late,
    Unless you are trying for a new world record for,
     "The Biggest Fly-paper in the World!!"

(More putrefaction-related funnies coming soon!!)

This must rank as the most dubious start to an article ever....

„(AKA, What am I going to write this month???)

Some STE games at last???? This STE enhancement business is 
certainly taking off, in a big, er, middling, er, small way.. 
ROBOCOP III, as reviewed in the previous issue not only accesses 
the Stereo DMA chip, but also uses some of the additional 3584 
colours available to the STE, in the graphix too, although it does 
look pretty good on the STFM, the STE uses subtler shading, and 
looks a lot more like the Amiga version, a fact not mentioned in 
my previous review (But then again, not mentioned by any other 
magazine either...)

There is also the case of 'Fire and Ice', the latest Grafgold 
effort, to be distributed by Renegade, which also uses the 
enhanced palette in loads of raster-type effects to enhance the 
graphix, first impressions are quite favourable, a review to 
follow soon..

Of more potential are the Atari-sponsored STE-only games, based on 
the licences for „Steel Talons, and „Road Riot, These are coin-ops, 
with 256 colours onscreen, in conversion to the STE can expect to 
come with 48 colours „per line?. Full use made of the blitter and 
other hardware, and „8 channel DMA stereo sound?? Also, these are 
expected to be upwardly compatible with the Mega STE and TT series 
(„and Falcon?? ) „Road Riot is an off-road racer/driving game, 
whereas „Steel Talons is a 3-D polygon based helicopter combat sim 
thing. This move comes only three years after the STE was 
launched, the actual quality of the games have yet to be assessed, 
although they look very interesting on paper..

„That list of STE-enhanced games in full (As best as I can 
remember... This won't take too long??)

'Rock Star ate my Hamster' - (God knows how...)

'Vaxine' - (Enhanced palette, samples still on YM soundchip 
 though..)

'Space Ace' (and other Readysoft games) - (4096 colour palette..)

'Oops Up' - (Erm, don't know..)

'James Pond' (and Robocod?) - (Additional raster colours to 
 background..)
„
'Revenge of the Mutant Camels' -(Good ol'shareware, Raster skyline 
 and samples (6.25khz) on DMA chip..)

'Fire and Ice' - (More Raster thingys..)

'Robocop III' - (Subtler shading in 3-D sections, Stereo Soundchip 
 'found' by programmers as well..) The first top-selling game to 
 feature STE enhancements

Also honorific mention to Wings of Death II which features a 
module running at 25 khz in stereo on the STE, and also uses the 
blitter...

Any more to go on the list??? You know the address by now....

(„It may interest you to note that at least two of these were 
discovered by accident, without prior mention by any mainstream 
computer press, I refer to …James Pond„, and …ROBOCOP III... )„

Also, we were threatened with an STE-enhanced version of Hydra, 
the rather dismal river-racer, but Domark cried-off for budgetary 
reasons..

It does seem, at last. there is a belated recognition of the extra 
hardware in the STE by some software producers at least.. Will it 
take as long with the Falcon? We hope not...

On the demo side of things, the main attraction has been a "new" 
Swedish group, „Inner Circuit Explorers, or ICE, who have been 
coding on the STE for a year, without anyone in the UK knowing 
about them, it seems. Their first collection of assorted screens 
has already been reviewed in the Demo section of Maggie 
separately, but they kindly sent me a couple of preview screens 
for the Electra „Mega Leif demo competition, The larger screen, 
'The Space Tale' is a solid 3-D object displayer, which is 
probably not STE specific, but the 'Kryos' screen has 4-channel 
25khz sound, and has various fullscreen 'Happenings'.. All will be 
revealed in due course...

My first look at the massive „Phaeleon Giga-demo, compiled by NEXT 
seems to how at least one STE specific screen, and a number of 
bits, soundtracker routines etc, coded to use the extra hardware.. 
A review will follow in a future issue..

As time is suddenly short (A „first for Maggie?!?!?!) I will now 
sign off this article, rather more quickly than I wanted to... Bye 
for nowwwww.....
