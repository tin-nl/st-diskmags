As Big Alec is flying around in Swabia this week we thought to do 
reviews together -- a musician, a coder and a grafic artist, that 
is the best requirement to make an objective judgement about a 
demo! ‚(ED: And, to be honest, the main reason was that we needed as 
much articles as possible to fill this 'low quality' disk mag!)

Let's start the demo!
The disk is pushed in the floppy drive and the drivelight begins to 
flash. Suddenly, the whole screen starts to jerk - strange 
flickering 'rasters' appear on the monitor and the owner of it 
begins to yell! Those f*cking froggies had done a 70 Hz booter. ‚(ED: 
All those fans of 70 Hz are required to write an article to explain 
us why they use it, because WE don't understand them!)
After some seconds the 70 Hz crap is over and the demo or better 
call it 'dentro' begins. The sound from Silents called 
'Hysteria' (7.5 kHz??) and nice text effects through the whole 
dentro making it worth to look at. By the way, the whole demo seems 
to be very much inspired by some Amiga demo/dentros.
The grafics would be really nice if there wasn't this odd font with 
some wrong letters in it (some letters had the wrong width and had 
contact to the other letters - that looks bad). But to be fair we 
have to say that it was the only mistake - the font itself looks 
quite good anyway and there are some fantasic logos too!
There are some (to be precise: 30) vectorballs too and to quote New 
Mode „'That's fucking ace!'. We think that says enough.

What left to say?
The whole dentro runs like a movie - no menu (there is no need of a 
menu!). The sound is nice for the ears, the grafics looks fine and 
the code seems to be very intelligent (if you forget the 70 Hz 
rubbish!).


 RATING:

sound >>>>>>>> 8.5
grafics >>>>>> 7
code >>>>>>>>> 8
overall >>>>>> 6.5 (because of the 70 Hz shit!)
               8.5 (if there wasn't this 70 Hz bollocks!)
