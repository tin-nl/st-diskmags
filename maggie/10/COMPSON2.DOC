JES The mighty system
Ran my C-P-U
It did my work with-out a quirk
And never was I blue

An M-V-S sub-system
JES-2 could not fail
It printed jobs and punched my cards
And e-ven did NET-mail

My users were unhappy
M-V-S was hard to learn
They wanted something eas-i-er
A place where they could turn

So when my boss assigned me
To find a better way
I started searching for soft-ware
That might make their day

I thought we would try U-NIX
But that was even worse
While I-B-M has P-L-S
'C' is far too terse

My time was running out
And I was not inspired
I knew it would be two more weeks
Before I would be fired

JES the mighty system
Ran my C-P-U
It did my work without a quirk
And never was I blue

An M-V-S subsystem
JES-2 could not fail
It printed jobs and punch my cards
And e-ven did NET-mail

I was getting worried
And so I came to SHARE
I asked around and what I found
Was a big teddy BEAR

Software that was simple
Eas-y to understand
With V-M in the world today
All others would be canned

My users were now happy
Content and worry free
V-M and friendly C-M-S
Sure saved the day for me

The only thing I'll miss
That M-V-S pro-vides
Is all that great JES-2 source code
That I-B-M can't hide

JES the mighty system
Ran my C-P-U
It did my work with-out a quirk
And never was I blue

An M-V-S sub-system
JES-2 could not fail
It printed jobs and punched my cards
And e-ven did NET-mail

Some systems live forever
But not so M-V-S
'Cause T-S-O and S-M-P
Are too much of a mess

V-M is like heaven
It's software you can trust
But as I'm sure you're all aware
That source code is a must

My eyes looked t'ward tomorrow
As I scratched my C-D-S
I'd never have to worry now
Which SYS-MODS I'd regress

Without a super-visor
JES-2 could not be run
And so that code of Houston fame
Just rode into the sun

Jes the mighty system
Ran my C-P-U
It did my work with-out a quirk
And never was I blue

An M-V-S sub-system

Title    : Just remember that you're flying o'er a disk pack....
Original : Just remember that you're standing...
Group    : Monty Python, (Meaning of Life)
Author   : Tony Duell  <ard@siva.bris.ac.uk>
Intro    : 
Song     : 

Just remember that you're flying
over a disk pack that's revolving
and revolving
at 90,000 revs an hour
and seeking at 100 tracks a second
so its reckoned
for a system that is the source of all our power.
The disk and you and me,
and all the files that we can see
are transfering at 180,000 bytes a sec,
in an outer system rack at 25,000 blocks an hour
for controller that was made by DEC

The controller itself is called an RK11-C
Its 10 and a half inches side to side
It's made from flip-chip, that is plain to see
and the data path is 16 bits wide
We're 15 devices from the bus arbitor,
we get served every 200 millisec,
and our system is just one of hundreds and thousands
on the amazing and expanding UNIBUS

The UNIBUS itself keeps on transfering
and transfering
all of the data it can whiz.
as fast as it can go,
it's asynchronous you know,
3 million bytes a second and thats the fastest that there is
So remember when you're waiting for the Non-processor grant,
how amazingly unlikely is a crash,
And pray that someone's changed the filters last week,
or we will soon be ready for the trash !!!!!!

           [to be sung to the tune of
                 Homeward Bound]


I'm just a little value cell,
And I play my special role so well --
        Hmmm --
Serving as a global switch
To predicate some system glitch;
But some strange value -- who knows which? --
Could cause me functions to bewitch!
        Lambda bound!
I wish I was
        Lambda bound!
Bound, so no SETQ's get me;
Bound, so quits will reset me;
Bound, where I can forget my
        Top-level value.

It's hard to catch those system screws:
'Most any value causes me to lose --
        Hmmm --
Each atom looks the same to me,
Whose interned name I cannot see,
And every NIL and every T
Reminds me that I long to be
        Lambda bound!
I wish I was
        Lambda bound!
Bound, so no SETQ's get me;
Bound, so quits will reset me;
Bound, where I can forget my
        Top-level value.

Next time I'll have a MAR break set
And try to catch each clobber threat --
        Hmmm, mmmm --
The next covert attempt to mung
Will cause the MAR break to be sprung,
But then the poor LISP will be hung
Because I'm not as I have sung:
        Lambda bound!
I wish I was
        Lambda bound!
Bound, so no SETQ's get me;
Bound, so quits will reset me;
Bound, where I can forget my
        Top-level value.

Leavin' Fed'ral Express

All my disks are packed, no room for more,
You think you'll ship me out the door,
I hate to tell you I've got one more bug.
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn.
The truck is waitin', he's blowin' his horn.
But you've got time for just one more compile.


Chorus:

So link me and debug me,
Try to write new code for me.
You've sold me now, you've got to let me go.
I'm leavin' Fed'ral Express.
Don't know how you could ship this mess.
Oh wait, it can't be time to go.

There's so many times I've let you down.
So any ancient bugs you've found.
I tell you now, you ain't seen a thing.
Every place I go there's bugs anew.
Every one they find reflects on you.
But think about the money that I'll bring.


(Chorus)

Now the time has come to ship me,
One more time, try to link me.
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come,
When you don't rush to get things done,
About the time, I wont have to say,

(Chorus)

Well I'm not braggin' boys so don't put me down.
But I've got the fastest ROM boot in town.
When somethin' comes up you know I don't even try.
I just hit the return key an let her fly.
She's my little PC, you don't know what I've got.

Just a little PC with a monochrome.
But we tell the other guys take your Apples home.
She's got a printer port and a network board
And an 8087 on the motherboard.

She's my little PC, you don't know what I've got.

She's got an Alpha Byte card with a 232
And her memory sings like she's cryin' the blues.
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid,
There's one more thing; I've got a hard disk daddy.

When I bring her on line all I see is green,
Till I turn the brightness up and clear the screen.
I get bent out of shape and I start to fret,
When I have to boot again 'cause there's no reset.

She's my little PC, you don't know what I've got.

Title    : The Maven
Original : The Raven
Group    : E.A. Poe
Author   : The Dragon
Intro    : 
Song     : 

                          The Maven
 
Once upon a weekend weary, while I pondered, beat and bleary,
Over many a faintly printed hexadecimal dump of core --
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some Source user chatting, chatting of some Mavenlore.
"Just a power glitch," I muttered, "printing out an underscore --
                Just a glitch and nothing more."
                
Ah, distinctly I remember that old Teletype ASR,
And the paper tape dispenser left its chad upon the floor.
Eagerly I thought, "Tomorrow, maybe I will go and borrow
>From my friend an Apple micro -- micro with a monitor --
So that I can chat at leisure, and then throw away my paper --
                Lying all across the floor. 
And the repetitious tapping which had nearly caught me napping
Woke me -- and convinced me that it could not be an underscore;
Appearances can be deceiving, so I sat there, still believing;
"My terminal must be receiving more express mail from the Source --
That's it -- my terminal's receiving new express mail from the Source;
                Posted mail and nothing more."
 
But my curiosity grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
I stood up and crossed the room to see what waited there in store.
Sticking up from the terminal were three inches or so of paper;
Carefully my trembling hand tore off the scrap, and then I swore --
"What is this?", I cried in anger -- here I threw it to the floor;
                Blankness there and nothing more.
 
Deep into its workings peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
What could cause the thing to stutter, dropping twenty lines or more?
But the ribbon was unbroken, and the "HERE IS" gave no token,
I thought the Teletype was broken, so I typed the number "4"!
This I typed, and then the modem echoed back the number "4" --
                Merely this and nothing more.
 
Back then to my work returning, with my temper slowly burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely that is just another RESET message;
With my luck, there's probably expensive data to restore!" --
As it chattered, still I sat there, trying to complete my chore.
                "'Tis the Source and nothing more."

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the dour and cryptic Maven now whose words I puzzled o'er;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the seat back's plastic lining that the lamp-light fluoresced o'er,
But whose flattened plastic lining with the lamp fluorescing o'er
                Shall compress, ah, little more!
 
All at once my thoughts grew clearer -- as if looking in a mirror,
Now at last I understood where I had sent the number 4!
"Look," I typed, "I was just testing -- did you think that I was jesting?
Why was it so interesting that I typed the number 4?
Did you think that you were chatting to some foolish sophomore?"
                Quoth the Maven, "... #4?"
 
"Maven!" said I, "Great defender! Venerable comprehender!
Whether you began this chat, or were a victim of error,
Mystified, and yet undaunted, by this quandary confronted," --
(Could my terminal be haunted?) -- "tell me truly, I implore --
Can you understand my message? -- tell me, tell me, I implore!"
                Quoth the Maven, "#4!"
 
"Maven!" said I, "Great pretender! Ancient Jewish moneylender!
By the Source that now connects us -- by the holy Oath you swore --
Tell me in your obscure wisdom if, within your distant modem,
You receive my words unbroken by backspace or underscore --
Tell me why my Teletype prints nothing but the number 4!"
                Quoth the Maven, "#4?"
 
"Be that word our sign of parting, bard or friend!" I typed, upstarting --
"Get back to your aimless chatter and obnoxious Mavenlore!
Leave no token of your intent -- send no messsage that you repent!
Leave my terminal quiescent! -- Quit the chat hereinbefore!
Type control-P (or escape), and quit this chat forevermore!"
                Quoth the Maven, "#4..."
 
And the Maven, notwithstanding, still is chatting, still is chatting
Over my misunderstanding of his cryptic "#4?";
And I calmly pull the cover and remove a certain lever
>From the 33ASR, which I never shall restore;
And a certain  ASCII number that lies broken on the floor
                Shall be printed -- nevermore!

Give us the word our work is no joke, Sir,

We'd like to do them and play with some mice.
Pop-up menus would really be friendly,

Ode to Amy
or
The Frontend Shuffle

(To the tune of: The Longest Time, Billy Joel)

If you said the deadline was tonight,
There would still be functions left to write.
What else could I do?
I get the frontend from you.
And I'll be coding for the longest time.

Once I thought enhancements we all done.
Now I know the battle can't be won.
The boss will find me,
Give me work and then remind me.
That I'll be coding for the longest time.

I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall.
And we need a miracle that's all.
Because we need you.
And I know we'll want to see you.
'Cause we'll be coding for the longest time.

Maybe this wont last very long,
The new fix is right, but I could be wrong.
Maybe I've been coding too hard,
But I've come this far, and a bonus I hoped for.

Who knows how much further we'll go on.
Frontend will be broken when you're gone.
I'll take my chances,
I forgot this disk drive dances
And I'll be coding for the longest time.

I had second thoughts at the start.
I said to myself I hope that she's smart.
Now I know the woman that you are.
Your coding is bizarre,
But it's more that I hoped for.

I don't care what consequence it brings.
Kludge it and get on to other things.
This code is so bad.
I think you ought to know that
I intend to debug for the longest time.

I dreamed I was a brand new language,

I handled strings as fast as RPG,
And twice as easily.

I crunched numbers like COBOL,
Trees like APL,
And FORTRAN loaned its FORMATs and GO TOs,
The cause of many screws.

And then a man said, "Now we'll write a monitor,
With Multics what it's for.
Our project is begun;
We'll code in PL/I."

Then I saw thousands of coders
Searching for their bugs,
And then I heard them mentioning my name
And leaving me the blame.

      THE PROGRAMMER'S BLUES - WITH APOLOGIES TO GLENN FRYE

      There's trouble in the data now, I can feel it in my bones,
      Had a premonition that I shouldn't program alone,
      Had the new Rev loaded but I didn't think it'd fry,
      Then everything exploded and 2 weeks work blew sky-high!

      So baby here's a printout and a keyboard in your hand,
      And here's a little floppy. Now, do it just the way he planned,
      You debug for 20 days and I'll pay you 20 grand!

      I'm sorry it went down like this, but some chip had to fuse.
      It's the typing of the language, it's the programmer's blues...

      Programmer's blues...

      Coder's and analyst's, hacker's and sysop's,
      The comments and strange bomboffs, and the bugs nobody copped,
      No matter if it's Pascal, Basic, or Cobol,
      You've got to carry manuals, there's no online help at all!

      It's lots of rotten coffee, and lots of dirty food,
      Every variable name is dangerous, it might have been pre-used,
      It's the lure of relaxed typing, it's so easy to be crude!

      Perhaps you'll understand it better, when you see my tools,
      It's the ultimate enhancement, it's the programmer's blues...

      Programmer's blues...

      You see it in the memos, you read them every day,
      They say you have to fix those bugs, but they don't go away.
      No matter how hard you work, it just won't run ok,
      You bury them in subroutines, but you know they are here to stay!
       
      You hope that none'll notice them, but they always seem to do,
      You beg for Beta-testing, maybe one will give a clue,
      Down from the office of your manager, you learn the heat's on you...
  
      Heat's on you...

      It's a losing proposition, but one you can't refuse,
      It's policies of debugging, it's the programmer's blues...

Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
      Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
      And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
      Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
      And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
              (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
              (chorus)

Too much, too soon, too far, to go, too late

<Big musical introduction. Sound of door opening, and our
hero Process Bluebottle (P) runs up to microphone, where the
Kernel (K) is wait(2)ing.>


P: PING 255.255.255.255! <boos, rasperberries>
K: Just the process I've been looking for.
P: Oh!
K: <sings>
 Clamber into my disk heads, Fred
 Whence all but you have exec'd, Fred
 There is no contesting,
 I've no way of manefesting
 How much I'd prefer you dead, Fred
P: Oh I'm glad you like me, my Kernel
 Because I trust you to.
K: Gratifiy your wim, Jim.
P: Jim? What happened to Fred?
K: He mv'd his name.
P: What to?
K: Chunky.
 Tell me, can you catch Jim?
P: No, Jim can not catch.
K: Then open this named pipe, son
 On the file system, son
 Which I have carefully arranged
  so it will open up and throw you
  into thirty K of NULLs
  when you upset the pipe by reading
  from it, Jim.
P: I say, it's not for deading me, is it Kernel?
K: Oh course not, dear boy! Just read from it a bit further!
P:  Righty-ho then.  Ahh. Here I am on the edge of the nice
  little named-type pipe.  It is a lovely day for
  a naughty pipe.  <CRUNCH!>
  
 YAHHH! You've swamped me.
 I do not like this game.
 
 <sings>
 I've got those "When I say I trust you I do not want to be KILLed
 because I do not like those kind of signals" Blues.
 I don't like naughty files that give my gets(3) binary data.
 (They say harm can come to a growing process like that)
 And I do not like SIGQUITs that longjmp me back to main()
 Out of my reniced batch queue
 I don't like being woken by nasty SIGALRM showers
 And I do not like being nutted by Eifel and Fortran programs
 So I do not want to be KILLed, HUPed, TERMed, QUITed, XCPUed
  INTed!
 I don't like that kind of type blues -- I don't like that
 I've got them SIGHUP Blues.
 
K: Still alive?
 Take this /dev/tty, pet.
P: Oh tar(1).
K: No, don't iocntl it yet, pet.
 <off> All right, now you can iocntl it.
P: Are you sure I won't be KILLed or nothing, Kernel?
K: <off> No, no -- don't be frightened!
P: All right then, I'll just send a DUP to it,
 and .... < BOOOM>
 
 < over explosion >
 
 You rotten swine you!  You HUPed me again.
 I shan't play this rotten game no more.
 
 Closes open files, pages out memory
 And exists through little hole in Mail deamon security...

I shoulda' learned to program some.
Look at that drive, I'm gonna stick it on the channel,
Man, it's better than the old one...

                When I Was a Lad
              from H.M.S. Pinafore]


When I was a lad I served a term
As office boy to a computing firm.
I polished the handle of the big front door
And swept up all the card chips from the keypunch floor.
        He swept up all the card chips from the keypunch floor.
I swept that chad so carefullee
That now I am officially a CDP.
        He swept that chad so carefullee
        That now he is officially a CDP.

My office job was a heavy load,
So I went to night school and learned to code.
I was soon coding payroll in RPG
And compiled all my programs on a System/3.
        He compiled all his programs on a System/3.
I compiled my code so gay and free
That now I am officially a CDP.
        He compiled his code so gay and free
        That now he is officially a CDP.

I wrote efficient code each day,
But I missed the benefits of higher pay.
I asked for a raise, but my boss said, "See,
Youse ain't good enuf because youse ain't a CDP."
        "He ain't good enuf because he ain't a CDP."
So I vowed that someday I would see
Myself become officially a CDP.
        So he vowed that someday he would see
        Himself become officially a CDP.

For nineteen weeks I worked to cram
All the textbooks for the CDP exam.
Then I took the exam and was shocked to see
That the questions didn't seem to mean a thing to me.
        All the questions didn't seem to mean a thing to him.
So I wrote down some answers randomly,
But I gave up all my hopes to be a CDP.
        So he wrote down some answers randomly,
        But he gave up all his hopes to be a CDP.
Well, those random answers worked out fine;
They scored my results at the top of the line.
Now I am a consultant here,
And I make at least a hundred thousand bucks each year.
        And he makes at least a hundred thousand bucks each year.
But I only command such a salary
Because I am officially a CDP.
        But he only commands such a salary
        Because he is officially a CDP.

Now, office boys, whoever you may be,
If you want to rise to the top of the tree,
Just go and take the CDP exam,
And no matter what you answer they won't give a D--n!
        And no matter what you answer they won't give a D--n!
Just answer it all as random as you please
And you will all officially be CDPs.
        Just answer it all as random as you please
        And you will all officially be CDPs.

My programming day has come to an end, I know,
But one minor bug still restrains me, though,
So back to me desk I stumble,
More coffee I pour in my mug,
So back to me desk I stumble,
More coffee I pour in my mug,
And I drink, and I think, and I program
Just one more hack, just one more hairy kludge
To remove that bug.

Machines are alive with the sound of FORTRAN,
With numbers they've crunched for a thousand hours;
They add and subtract to the sound of FORTRAN,
And raise fractions to unheard of powers.

My code's full of REAL statements, INTEGER and COMPLEX too,
        duplicated thrice oe'r,
And so intermixed with the WRITEs and READs
        to cause errors galore;
Arrays are declared of dimension six, but indexed minus two;
Computed GO TOs are last in the range of a DO!

I now recompile my corrected programs;
I know I will get what compiled before --
My code will be blessed with the sound of FORTRAN,
And I'll lose once more.

And I'll lose once more.

Hello lab work my old foe
I've come to feel my anger grow
I have to find your composition
Using your spectograph emission
But I can't, and I'm on my seventh try
I start to cry
These are the sounds of science

My test tube shatters with a pop
The gunk eats through the tabletop
Through all the science labs in Thimann
You can hear the students screamin'
And my own voice rises up above the rest
I'm so depressed
These are the sounds of science

The tabletop begins to smoke
The students all begin to choke
The TA hurries to my station
And then dies of asphyxiation
And I whine "I'm having trouble with this class
I hope I pass."
These are the sounds of science

The deadly smoke goes through the halls
And peels the paint right off the walls
And then I note with aggravation
This means a bad evaluation
And I breathe a long and melancholy sigh
And then I die

Song     : 

     Structured Programmer's Soliloquy

SP or not SP -- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The rules and exceptions of outrageous FORTRAN
Or to take arms against a sea of transfers
And by structuring end them.  To code -- to test
No more; and by a test to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural mistakes
That FORTRAN is heir to.  'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd.  To code -- to test.
To test -- perchance to bomb:  aye, there's the rub!
For in that test of code what bugs may come
When we have shuffled of this FORTRAN code,
Must give us pause.  There's the respect
that makes calamity of so long lists.   [??]
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time-sharing
Th' operating systems wrong, the computer's crash,
The pangs of despis'd code, the turnaround's delay,
The insolence of compilers, and the spurns
That patient coding of FORTRAN takes
When he himself might his quietus make
with PL/I?  Who would this FORTRAN Bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary language,
But that the dread of something after FORTRAN
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourne
No programmer returns -- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn away
And lose the name of action.

I've looked in kernel memory,
I've looked in the tables.

For fifty million pages.
They call me the swapper.
I've been searching low and high.
Unix won't run out of memory

I asked Ken Thompson.
I asked comp.unix.wizards,
But they couldn't help me either.
They call me the swapper.
I've been searching low and high.
Unix won't run out of memory
Till the day I die.

People tend to hate me,
Cause I swap too slow.
As I page out their jobs
They want to shake my hand.
Focusing on swap space,
Investigating pagefaults,
I'm a pagedaemon,
I'm a very desperate hack.

Unix won't run out of memory
Till the day I die.

I learned how to raise resident set size.
Yeah, but look at this process it's mem'ry bound!
I'm happy when you segfault,
and when you run thrash.c I crash.
I get values but I
Don't know how or why!

I'm looking for core,
You're looking for CPU,
We're running on the same box,
And we don't know what to do!
They call me the swapper.
I've been searching low and high.
Unix won't run out of memory

Author   : ? (Another Cambrigde product)
Intro    : 
Song     : 

Once upon a time there was a system
Which read and spooled and ran the printers too.
Remember how we coded up the changes,
And dreamed of all the great things we could do.

    That was the HASP my friend,
    There's no use to pretend,
    We sang and danced and coded the night away.
    We'd make the mods we choose,
    We'd fight and never lose,
    For we had HASP and it would lead the way.
    Tra-la la-LA la-la,
    Tra-la la-LA la-la,
    We had the HASP and it would lead the way.

Then the busy years went rushing by us,
HASP went version two to version three.
The features and enhancements kept on coming,
From execution batch to R-J-E.

    That was the HASP my friend ...

Soon the days on VS were upon us,
The future role of HASP was now in doubt.
But version four of HASP was soon to follow,
And show what virtual spooling's all about.

    Yet today there looms another system,
    It's more complex and difficult to grasp.
    We look at M-V-S and ask the question,
    Is that JES2 system really HASP?
    It's really HASP my friend:
    There's no use to pretend.
    We'll sing and dance and code the night away.
    We'll make the mods we choose,
    We'll fight and never lose,
    For we have HASP and it will lead the way.

Nine nixies blinking,
Eight drums a-spinning,
Seven screens a-scrolling,
Six mice a-clicking,
Five write rings,
Four coding sheets,
Three punch cards,
Two paper tapes,
And a cartridge in a P.C.

Title    : These are are a Few of Our Favorite Machines
Original : These are a Few of My Favorite Things
Group    : Traditional
Author   : Nelson Bishop <nelson@natinst.com>
Intro    : This song was written about the time the Mac was first
           introduced. Most of the machines mentioned were some
           sort of IBM PC semicompatible. We generally managed to
           port to them in time for them to be withdrawn from the
           market. The memory singing refers to an Alpha Byte memory
           expansion board which had an audible high pitched whine.
Song     : 


These are are a Few of Our Favorite Machines

(To the tune of "These are a Few of My Favorite Things")

Compaqs and Lisas and hard disks with tape drives,
Sperrys and Victors and Wangs with no disk drives.
Gray IBMs with the mem'ry that sings,
These are a few of our favorite machines.

TIs and Rainbows and Dots with no futures
Trendspotter's dead, but it draws pretty pictures.
HP-150s you touch on the screens,
These are a few of out favorite machines.

Chorus:
When the bits byte, when the bugs sting,
When out code is bad,
We simply remember our favorite machines,
And then we know we've -- been had
Mainframes and micros and minis with Unix,
Networks and async and mice with some new tricks.
We get the Journal and read everything,
So we'll know which is our favorite machine.

Bright Macintoshes to purchase on credit,
We can't afford it this year so forget it.
Boss, we all need a big raise as you've seen,
So we can purchase our favorite machines.

Chorus

   Unix Wizard

Ever since I heard of Unix
I've always had a ball,
From SunOS to Minix
I must have run 'em all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
On systems large or small
That tired, squinting, blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

He sits like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine,
Feeling all the limits,
Knows what the signals mean
Hacks by intuition
His process never stalls,
That tired, squinting blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

He a Unix Wizard,
I just can't get the gist
A Unix wizard's 
Got such a mental twist

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions
Don't hear no beeps or bells
Don't see no lights a flashin'
Ignores his sense of smell
Patches running kernels
Dumps no core at all,
That tired, squinting and blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

I thought I was
The process table king,
But I just handed
My root password to him.

Even on my favorite boxen,
His hacks can beat my best.
The network leads him in,
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy Finger servers
Never will seg-fault...
That tired, squinting blind kid
Sure makes a mean sys call!

Is this the real login:?
Is it a trap?
Caught on a terminal
No escape from the committee


Open your mail
Look up to the skies
And see...

I'm just a poor hacker,
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low

Hit me where the wind blows,
Doesn't really matter to me, to me



Momma, just killed a VAX
Type a command into the shell,
Hit RETURN, now it's dead
Momma, my account had just begun
And now I've gone and thrown it all away
Momma, didn't mean to make you crash
If I'm not back on this time tomorrow
Hack on, hack on as if nothing really matters


Too late -- my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine
Bodies aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Got to leave you all behind and face the truth

Momma, (every way the wind blows)
I don't wanna kicked off,
I sometimes wish I'd never logged on at all

Title    : What is a Hacker?
Original : What is a DJ?
Group    : Spike Jones
Author   : Russell Street <russells@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz>
Intro    : [longish - sth]
Sometime ago I recorded from a radio programme a Spike Jones
recording "What is a DJ?".  I think it was recorded in the
50's -- it includes a reference to televison advertising stealing
from radio.
It has only recently occured to me that it is perfect for
adapting to describe the "hacker".  Above is my first
attempt to do this, along with the original (below)
Unfortunately I can not find out who actually wrote it or when.
The only information that the announcer gave was that it was
a Spike Jones recording, and it was only released once.

I have only changed the words to suit computer ideas,
keeping with the original flow, patterns and concepts.
Any suggestions this could improve this are welcomed.


The original recording has some organ music that flows with
and emphasis the way it is read.  It is difficult to reproduce
this in text.  Most of this is to do with the speed at which
it is spoken.


The original:


What is a DJ?
-------------

Between the commercialism of the sponsor, and the innocence
of the radio audience we find a delightful creature called
the Disc Jockey.

Disc Jockeys come in assorted sizes, weights and colours. But
all disc Jockeys have the same creed: to fill every minute of
every hour of every day with records and commercials. And to
protest with noise, their only weapon, when the last programme
has finished and the radio sponsor switches his interest to
television.

Disc Jockeys are found everywhere -- radio stations, golf courses,
advertising agencies, underneath, inside of, climbing on, swinging
from, running away to, on top of **OLD SMOKY**.

Mothers ignore them, little girls don't understand them, 
older sisters tolerate them, adults HA!  Heaven and the 
advertising agencies protect them.

A disc jockey is truth with a script in his hand, beauty with
a bloodshot voice, wisdom with a cut of the profits, and the
hope of the sponsor with a frog in his throat.

When you are busy a disc jockey is a inconsiderate, bothersome,
intruding jangle of noise.  When you want him to play a beautiful
melodic record his brain turns to jelly. Or else he becomes
a savage sadistic jungle creature bent on destroying his Hooper
rating and himself with a brass band playing into an echo chamber.

A disc jockey is a composite.  He has the brain of an adding
machine, the ulcers of a banker, the persistency of an
auctioneer, the diction of a train announcer, the subtlety of
a meat cleaver, and when he has to put a record on the turn-table
by himself he has five thumbs on each hand! <CRASH>

He likes free albums, swimming pools, Dixieland records,
cadallics, money, sponsors (in their natural habitat), free passes
and the girl-across-the-street.

He is not much for music, song sloggers, other disc Jockeys,
the sales department, engineers, and the girl-across-the-street's
husband.

Nobody else is so early to rise or to late to supper.
Nobody else gets so much fun out of old joke books, loud records,
fan mail and females.  Nobody else can cram into one half hour
so many commercials about soap, falling hair, toothpaste, 
deodorant, non-skid tyres and a large chunk of unknown substance.

A disc jockey is a magical creature. You can turn him off your
radio but you can't turn him off your neighbour's radio.  You
can get him out of your mind, but you can't get him out of the
air.  He's a bleary-eyed, syrup-voiced, fast-talking, bundle
of noise.

But, when you wake up in the morning with only the shattered
pieces of your sleep and dreams he can make you wish you'd never
been born with the two magic words:

                           GOOD MORNING!

Song     : 

What is a Hacker? (version 1.01)
-----------------

Adapted by Russell Street (russells@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz)


Between the commericalism of the MSIS department, and the
innocence of the Real User we find a delightful creature
called the Computer Hacker.

Hackers come in assorted sizes, weights and colours. But
all hackers have the same creed: to fill every byte of
every disk of every machine with source code and old news.
And to protest with flames, their only weapon, when the last
process is KILLed and the computer centre switches to a
"better" computer.

Hackers are found everywhere -- univerities, colleges,
corporations, underneath, inside of, climbing on, swinging
from, running away to, on top of **VAXen**.

Management ignores them, secretaries don't understand them, 
Customer Support tolerate them, administrators HA!  Heaven
and the greatful user protect them.

A hacker is intelligence with a head ache, elegance with
a core dump, daring with a secure backup, and the hope of
the admin with the root password.

When you are busy a hacker is a inconsiderate, bothersome,
intruding, resource hogging process.  When you want him to
solve your problem his brain turns to jelly. Or else he
becomes a savage sadistic jungle creature bent on destroying
his reputation and your data with a misplaced 'rm -r'.

A hacker is a composite.  He has the brain of a adding 
machine, the stealth of a thief, the percistancy of a tiger,
the resourcefulness of cracker, the subtetly of a meat cleaver.
And when he has to put a tape in a drive by himself he has
five thumbs on each hand! <CRASH>

He likes USENET access, e-mail, source code, nethack, money,
admins (in their natural habitat), free accounts and the
new-girl-in-the-operator's-room.

He is not much for paper work, code grinders, other hackers
on his machine, the MSIS department, dummy money, and the
new-girl-in-the-operator's-room's husband.

Nobody else is so late to rise or to late to supper.
Nobody else gets so much fun out of old news files, loud
records, junk food and females.  Nobody else can cram into
one half hour so many requests for restores, bulk chowning,
increased disk space, more processer time, faster CPUs and
a large chunk of unknown substance.

A hacker is a magical creature. You can kick him off your
terminal but you can't kick him off your neighbour's terminal.
You can get him out of your mind, but you can't get him out of the
batch queue.  He's a bleary-eyed, syrup-voiced, fast-talking, bundle
of keystrokes.

But, when you are editing, with only the shattered pieces of working
code backed up, he can make you wish you'd saved sooner with the two
magic words:

                           SYSTEM CRASH!

Intro    : 
Song     : 

 When I was a lad I served a term
 As office boy in a computer firm.
 I cleared the bugs out, and I got to grips
 With polishing the silicon on all their chips.
 [With polishing the silicon on all their chips.]
 I polished up that silicon so carefully
 That now I am responsible for Phoenix 3.
 [He polished up that silicon so carefully
 That now he is responsible for Phoenix 3.]

 At cleaning chips I made such a name
 That a drinks pro-grammer I soon became:
 I mixed soup, cola and some fizzy tea,
 And when the program ran it cost 8p.
 [And when...]
 The users so enjoyed this Most Vile Tea
 That now I am responsible for Phoenix 3.
 [The users...]

 At making drinks I acquired such a knack
 That at operatorship I had a crack:
 I did the crossword, read about foot-ball
 And never tried unloading Printer 3 at all.
 [And never...]
 I tore off output sheets so carelessly
 That now I am responsible for Phoenix 3.
 [He tore...]

 The users often saw me every day,
 So I took on the job of a P.A.
 I told the beginners of GCAL and ZED,
 Or phoned up experts for their views instead.
 [Or phoned...]
 I passed the buck along so frequently
 That now I am responsible for Phoenix 3.
 [He passed...]

 I worked so hard that I required a rest,
 And so they got me dealing with SUGGEST:
 I took three months off, turned the users sour
 By claiming that I was a shortage of manpower.
 [By claiming...]
 I took a year off, did the C.S.T.
 To learn enough to work on Phoenix 3.
 [He took...]

 At user-friendliness I'd made such a mess,
 They got me working hard on MVS:
 I made commands obscure and twice as long,
 And changed the syntax so most jobs went wrong.
 [And changed...]
 I made such trouble they upgraded me
 By making me responsible for Phoenix 3.
 [He made...]

 Now hackers all, whoever you may be,
 If you want to do things faster than Queue D,
 If your eyes are forever glued to VDUs,
 Then leave the rat race and its four job queues:
 [Then leave...]
 Keep clear of machines, IBM or BBC,
 And you may get the blame for parts of Phoenix 3!
 [Keep clear...]

Title    : When you try to get work from the data network
Original : ?
Group    : Gilbert & Sullivan
Author   : ? (First seen at Cambridge, England)
Intro    : 
Song     : 

 When you try to get work from the Data Net-work, and you're
tapping the keys with impatience,
 It will say it's congested, your code stays untested, all users
are waiting for sessions.
 For with C.I.P. errors and similar terrors the C.U.D.N. tries to
thwart you
 And you hit RETURN thrice and ask friends for advice - for again
the new system has caught you,
 As your password is typed out before it is wiped out (by hitting
the button marked CLEAR SCREEN),
 And you hit CONTROL/P C and try to get busy at trying to conquer
the machine!
 Then the system expires and you pull out the wires and you find
that the VDU's broken,
 Get another one near, then walk out with a jeer for by now it
won't let any folk on!
 Well at last it permits you to log on and hits you, you join all
the users in weeping,
 For your session's such pain, and there's so little gain that
you'd very much better be sleeping!

 For you find your UPDATEing a file, and you're waiting five
minutes for ZED to acknowledge,
 While the user next door throws a fit on the floor and runs
screaming back home to his college;
 And you're typing ahead as you're waiting for ZED, then refile
to a file that is GUARDed,
 But forgot to say YES and you're now in a mess, as you think the
result's been discarded;
 Then you try to use RUN and it's really no fun, for the
scheduler's not very clever,
 And you're job's in queue D and you really can't see if it's
likely to run now, or ever.
 Well you try once again and it runs right as rain, so you have a
quick look with COLLECTREAD:
 The results of your look - "Standard Fixup" was took - IBM's
guess not what you expect/need!

 Fortran IV you reject, as you're program's all wrecked, so you
dump all your files TLS-wise,
 But the filename's too long, ARCHIVE always goes wrong, and
you're finding it's too much now, stress-wise!
 So at INFO.NEW you look, feeling quite blue, and you find that
the CS has faltered:
 All the keywords changed round, and you don't like the sound for
the language is terribly altered:
 For it's IBM-ese, wasn't written to please, though amuses the
people who wrote it,
 Each command a long word, of the like never heard, some
anomalies that you've just noted.
 From your work you now rest, see INFO.SUGGEST, which no-body has
looked at for ages,
 So you try SUGGEST-FILE, and ironically smile, which is better
than yielding to rages!
 Now with PRINTOUT you fail, it is lost in the mail, and your
hair you are frantically tearing,
 POST and ROUTE get ignored, once again you've been floored! You
log off with a shudder despairing...

 You are worn out and tired, feel the chief should be fired,
 For he won't sympathise, to use PHX never tries,
 And you're angry and cross, with the time that is loss,
 With a pain in you brain, swear "no more!" (all in vain!)
 For your session's a waste, never more should be faced,
 And you're nerves are all frayed, and your output's mislayed,
 You can't fix it today, the adviser's away,
 And you haven't been lying in clover:

 But the session is past, and it's teatime at last,
 And the torment's been long, ditto ditto my song,
 And thank goodness they're both of them over!

Title    : The Worm before Christmas
Original : The Night Before Christmas
Group    : ?
Author   : Received in a mailfile on Cornell's computer network.
           (Copied from m-net, Ann Arbor, MI)

THE WORM BEFORE CHRISTMAS

Twas the night before finals and all through the lab
Not a student was sleeping, not even McNabb.
Their projects were finished, completed with care
In hopes that the grades would be easy (and fair).

The students were wired with caffeine in their veins
While visions of quals nearly drove them insane.
With piles of books and a brand-new highlighter,
I had just settled down for another all-nighter --

When out from our gateways arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter
Away to the console I flew like a flash
And logged on as root to fend off a crash

The windows displayed on my brand new Sun-3
Gave oodles of info -- some in 3-D.
When, what to my burning red eyes should appear
But dozens of "nobody" jobs. Oh dear!

With a blitzkrieg invasion, so virulent and firm,
I knew in a moment. It was Morris's Worm!
More rapid than eagles his processes came
And they forked and exec'd and they copied by name!

"Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On Comet! On Cupid! On Donner and Blitzen!
To the sites in .rhosts and host.eqi
Now, dash away! dash away! dash away all!"

[ Note: the machines dasher.cs.uiuc.edu, dancer.cs.uiuc.edu,
  prancer.cs.uiuc.edu, etc., have been renamed deer1, deer2,
  deer3, etc., so as not to confuse the already burdened
  students who use those machines. We regret that this poem
  reflects the older naming scheme and hope it does not
  confuse the network administrator at your site. -Ed. ]

And then in a twinkling, I heard on the phone,
The complaints of the users (thought I was alone!)
"The load is too high!" "I can't read my files!"
"I can't send my mail over miles and miles!"

I unplugged the net, and was turning around,
When the worm-ridden system went down with a bound.
I frettedI fritteredI sweatedI wept.
Then finally I core dumped the worm in /tmp.

It was smart and pervasive, a right jolly old stealth,
And I laughed when I saw it, in spite of myself.
A look at the dump of that invasive thread
Soon gave me to know we had nothing to dread.

The next day was slow with no network connections
For we wanted no more of those pesky infections.
But in spite of the news and the noise and the clatter
Soon all became normal, as if naught were the matter.

Then later that month, while all were away,
A virus came calling, and then went away.
The system then told us, when we logged in one night:
"Happy Christmas to all! (You guys aren't so bright.)"

Write in C


When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
"Write in C."

As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers:
"Write in C."

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO's dead and buried,
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics!
Write in C.

If you've just spent nearly 30 hours
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
Only wimps use BASIC.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won't quite cut it.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
Don't even mention COBOL.
Write in C.

(and what about C++ ?)

    Yellow Subroutine

    "In the town where I was born,
    Lived a man, who played with 'C'.
    And he coded his whole life
    On a stack of Function Keys.

    So we traced to his data schemes,
    Til we found a 'C' routine..
    And we lived beneath the SAVES,
    In our yellow Sub-Routine...

Chorus:
    WE ALL live in A YELLOW SUB-ROUTINE,
    YELLOW SUB-ROUTINE, YELLOW SUB-ROUTINE .... (ETC)

    When our friends are on the boards,
    Many MODEMS RETURN NEXT:FOR
    Then the BAUD RATE goes astray...
    (B-B-BEEP, BEEP BEEP B-B-BEEP..)

Chorus (IF YOU CAN STAND IT!)

    As we live in Memories
    Every one of us Returns Linefeeds...
    CPU and 'C' Routine,
    In our yellow SUB-Routine...
