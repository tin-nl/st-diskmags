„Translated by New Mode


Despite their addiction to electronic music, „Skinny Puppy always 
was a band - a fact that almost meant the end of their careers. 
Internal quarrels almost led to a split in 1989/90. Dwayne R. 
Goettel and Cevin Key, the "responsibles" for the music of the 
„Puppies, concrentated on their project „Doubting Thomas, while 
singer and frontman Nivek Ogre wanted to change to the US-band 
„Ministry. In 1990 the three didn't tell happy things about „Skinny 
Puppy, and after the US-tour in the same year it was 
suspiciously quiet.
In 1991 the group went through a clean-up process. The resulting 
album „Last Rights probably isn't the best of the Canadians, but 
for sure it's the most personal album ever.
It seems that „Skinny Puppy will stay active for a very long time 
now - Cevin Key gave a very optimistic view through the whole 
interview. But read yourself:


Q: „Skinny Puppy are no longer under contract at the Nettwerk 
label. Didn't they want to renew your contract, or was there a 
dispute?

SP: We left Nettwerk in friendship. Overall we had three 
contracts with this label, our first contract was renewed two 
times. This time they weren't able to give us more possibilities. 
All the ambitions and plans we have - for example in visual 
sector - we want to work on with bigger production efforts. For 
that, we need somebody who stands behind the band and is open for 
our ideas. I regard Nettwerk and all things they've done for us, 
but we've reached a situation where they aren't able to support 
us any longer.


Q: The title of the new album „Last Rights sounds like a finale. 
Does it have something to do with the expired contract with 
Nettwerk?

SP: No. The title refers to the psychological drama, Ogre had to 
go through. I am quite sure that he almost reached the end of the 
line. He almost died and came through very close. Thanks god he's 
really over the hill now. He has passed a full detoxication. His 
condition was the only reason, why there was no reunion of „Skinny 
Puppy. We simply weren't able to handle this situation. There are 
enough problems on this world and it's really hard to see 
somebody destroying himself willingly.


Q: There are rumours that „Skinny Puppy are going to be on tour 
again. Are there any plans for a tour?

SP: Yes, we're currently preparing something and it's going on 
better than ever before. We will start to tour in North America 
this april, and in summer we'll be in Europe. It will be a real 
world tour.


Q: When will you play in Germany? Is the schedule already 
finished?

SP: We'll have our gigs probably in June, maybe first weeks of 
July.


Q: Can you tell some more details about the show?

SP: Hmmmmmm..., at this moment just a little bit. The show will 
be very different to all our shows in the past. We can afford a 
bigger gig. Never before we had so much control over our affairs 
and so much freedom.
The show will definately be the most extreme thing we've ever 
done. Work will be divided like always : Ogre will take over the 
visual aspects. At the moment he's in Los Angeles to prepare the 
show. Regarding the music, I have to say that we'll play lots of 
new material but also we'll have the classic „Skinny Puppy songs 
for the European audience in our bags.

Q: How will it go on after the tour? Will you be without a 
contract for further releases?

SP: A lot of things have developed very positive. We now have a 
management, Emerald Management in Chicago, that assures that our 
albums and CDs will be published worldwide. There are several 
„Skinny Puppy bootlegs due to several "supply gaps" and that 
shouldn't be, because most of the bootlegs sound horrible.
Until now we've done the management on our own, but with the two 
guys who do this work for us now, we're very happy. The support 
the band to it's full extend.

Q: Which label will publish your forthcoming productions?

SP: Actually there will be the tour first, which still is under 
contract to Nettwerk/Capitol Records. It's far too early to tell 
more about new contracts. Personally I would like to sign a 
contract directly with Capitol Records, but that's still wishful 
thinking.

Q: With all these positive developments and plans you tell, I 
must say that the latest album „Last Rights, was no quantum leap. 
Many songs remind you to „Too Dark Park, but without getting the 
same intensity. Other songs sound like old „Skinny Puppy material. 
What's the reason for this?

SP: I fully agree to your statement. We've been out of energy 
while we recorded this album. Nevertheless in my opinion my best 
song ever is on this album. It's „Killing Game. This song is the 
emotional summary of everything that happened inside „Skinny 
Puppy at the time we recorded the album. „Killing Game is one of 
the early recordings for „Last Rights. First I wrote „Love in Vein 
and then „Killing Game.
I first had to lean back after we've recorded these songs. I had 
nothing more to say, musically and on the human side. These songs 
represent the human side of „Skinny Puppy. Usually we work very 
much technically. Our material is very much constructed.
„Last Rights was hard to get into even for me. You have to listen 
to it several times to understand it. And for people apart from 
„Skinny Puppy it's very hard to understand what it means to the 
group.

Q: Why is song number 10 missing on the CD? Was it a press 
mistake?

SP: No, it was no pressmistake. The tenth song really has been 
left out, it was a big disappointment to us. It was supposed to 
be the title song of the album, but we will publish it later on. 
We just have to wait for permission.

Q: Why did you get in trouble with the title song „Last Rights?

SP: We have used lyrics of Timothy Lear. We had spoken consent, 
to quote his words, but afterwards the publisher of his books 
called and forbid us to release it. Of course we don't want to go 
to court. That's something that happened to us for the first 
time, tough shit!

Q: Tell us more about this song!

SP: It has something to do with the final battle of good and 
evil. And the last sentence that is spoken is "The last word of 
the last rights".

Q: That sounds really terribly important and religious..

SP: It's hard to describe, you have to hear the song to get an 
idea what's it about. It has nothing to do with the bible, but it 
deals with drug abuse, from the fight of inner against outer 
circumstances. I don't want to put down Ogre, but without doubt 
this song reflects his personal situation and our frustration 
about this was expressed, too.

Q: Has Ogre written some lyrics for „Last Rights or was everything 
done by Leary?

SP: Parts of the lyrics are by Nivek. The whole is a question- 
and answer game. Ogre reacts on words of Leary. All the other 
lyrics are written by Ogre, that was always his part.

Q: With all these optimistic perspectives of „Skinny Puppy, maybe 
we'll get some funny lyrics sometime?

SP: Wait and see... Of course it will go on with „Skinny Puppy, 
that's for sure!
