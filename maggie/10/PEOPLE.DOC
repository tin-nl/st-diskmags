Do you know people who you really hate and would like to get if 
this was possible?  I do, and what is more, here is a list of 
these despicable beings who should not even exist.

The lame postal system who, when they get their clutches on your 
precious disks, decide to hold on to them for a decade or two, or 
in the case of treasured international contacts, set their 
trained killer rabid hamsters onto their electronic media, thus 
"losing" them for good, thanks guys!!! A big a help as the 
Titanic dance band!!

Tesco, Goldington Road, Bedford - This is the real "Sobibor" of 
Tesco stores if ever there was one.  The management here are just 
like Nazis - they never trust you, always come up to you to give 
you a bollocking and generally give you hassle.

I'm not going to forget the 'Mothercare' lorry with the stupid 
reversing alarm,, "Warning - This vehicle is reversing," which 
sounds like it was recorded by somebody who was recently 
castrated, or ought to be, at any rate..

Bedford people in general - in shops, if you ask any questions 
about "Rutger Hauer" or "Joanna Pacula" they say "Sorry. never 
heard of him/her and we don't want to know anything about them 
either."

Major shops in Bedford - for their indifferent attitudes like "Do 
you have a copy of ST Format in stock?"  Answer usually is "Er, 
Er, Well..um..lets see now...er....well....."

Bedford car, van, bus and lorry drivers - they park all over the 
place usually causing obstructions to negotiate, they have no 
idea what to do - especially the women  who insist on sitting at 
25 mph on a 70mph dual carriageway/road.  Buses pull out in front 
of you - these drivers don't give a toss as to whether anyone is 
behind or at their side before pulling out, tossing a full death-
camps worth of smoke into the already poor atmosphere - doesn't 
do much to help the ozone layer now does it?

Old teachers at school near Bedford - Mr Randall (PE teacher) for 
general unpleasantness towards me.  Miss Marshall (French 
teacher) just like a Nazi.  Mrs Jackson (the cookery teacher) 
screams her soul out to me - do I give a toss or what?  Of course 
not.

Mr Jefferies (Geography teacher) - he called me a spastic and 
will pay for it when I catch up with him - WATCH OUT JEFFERIES, 
FELICE IS AFTER YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have put one person 
(Iovinelli from Tesco) in hospital for worse - you will die!!!!

Bedford Hospital - one way communication zone here from patient 
to hospital and that's all.  Very poor service, very boring.


SO THE MORAL OF THIS ARTICLE IS - DO NOT GO TO BEDFORD FOR 
ANYTHING.  NEVER USE BEDFORD HOSPITAL.  NEVER, NEVER WORK FOR 
TESCO AT BEDFORD - IN SHORT - PLEASE AVOID THE PLACE ALTOGETHER 
AS IT IS A SHIT HOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just forgot one thing - Power Computing are also from Bedford!  
It is no wonder considering their recent performances at shows 
etc, as read in previous issues of Maggie.  What shitheads Power 
Computing are to have all that stock there when they charge 
outrageous prices (œ600 for a Mega 1 ST when shops in London sell 
them brand-new for œ300!)

If you are unfortunate enough to live in Bedfordshire, use 
Peterborough, St Neots, Milton Keynes and Wellingborough for all 
your needs - remember this is supposed to be a serious article.
