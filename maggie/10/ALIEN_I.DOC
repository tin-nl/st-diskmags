First of all I have to tell you my taste of films. I like all new 
Arnold stuff, some horror movies (like Hellraiser & Splatter films) 
and Sciene Fiction like Alien. You see, I mainly like action movies 
- not the love crap or problem films - that sucks in my opinion!

My top five at the moment:
1. Basic instinct
2. Terminator II
3. Last Boy Scout
4. Stone Cold
5. Backdraft (I know, that ones a bit old - but I don't care!)

My 'Evergreen' top five:
1. Predator I
2. Die hard
3. Aliens II
4. Conan I
5. Bloodsport

Now you know my taste! Let's start the review....

"For the first time ever on video a special presentation of Ridley 
Scott's Sci-Fi classic - ALIEN, in its full wide screen glory.
- Now you can experience the true power of this film with all the 
special effects, excitement and atmosphere of a cinema screening.
- A must for all collectors."

That's what you can read on the box of the 'Alien I - wide screen' 
tape. Well, I think the riddle you'll like to be solved is: 'Is it 
true, what they have written or is it pure advertisment nonsense?'
With one sentence they are right! It IS a must for every collector 
or to be precise for all Alien fans who haven't got the old version 
yet. It is a bit more exciting to see the movie in wide screen as 
in 'normal' view..... at least for me. All the stuff that was 
cutted from the 'normal' version of the film can now be seen - but 
don't wait for big monsters or scenes you never saw before - there 
are no things like that! It's just the atmosphere that makes the 
tape worth buying (or copying??).

Concluding, I have to say that I liked the wide screen version very 
much (and because I am a video fanatic it isn't that easy to impress
me!) and I hope they go on with producing wide screen versions of 
brilliant movies!
