It started in May 1992. Me and my dad were going to Germany to 
buy a harddisk (it's cheaper than in Holland.) After some hours 
of waiting and walking through the city of Aachen, we got the 
harddisk and went home. I connected it to my 1040 STfm. IT 
DIDN'T WORK! It only wrote data to it but the computer couldn't 
read it (it's SCSI you know?) 

We went to a computer shop in Den Bosch to buy a new 1040 STfm. 
We tested the harddisk on it and it worked. When I got home, I 
connected it and it worked perfectly only .... the computer gave 
half of the memory and the screen was shifted so that the 
rasters were sometimes not on their places. The BMT overscan in 
The Year After demo by The Alliance didn't work properly either.

We went back to that shop again and decided to by a STe. It had 
better sound and as I am a musicican, I like that a lot. I 
connected the harddisk to my STe and it worked fantastic. All 
that fine music and Futurecomposer musics. I worked three weeks 
with it when it happened: my STe totally broke down. I couldn't 
even boot from a disk nor the computer itself. We went back to 
that shop again in Tilburg (it's nearer and it's the same 
company). That said they didn't knew how it could happened. They 
gave me a new one so that I could make music again.

I hobbied some days and then it broke down again. We got a new 
one again. It worked for one week. (My dad was getting furious). 
We went back and asked a new one. When I tested it I concluded 
that it was one of the broken ones. The many at the shop excused 
him, gave me 10 Nashua disks and a new 1040 STe. That one worked 
very long till last Friday night (3-7-92).

Now our patience was gone. We went to that shop and wanted to 
ask if we could get our money back but they asked us first. We 
got the money and left the building forgood. We went to another 
shop in Tilburg. It adverted with a very cheap Mega STe for the 
same price as the 1040 STe at the other shop. The man at the 
second shop said that a Mega STe 2 would cost not much more. We 
bought that one and now I'm sitting behind my Mega STe 2 with my 
keyboard on my lap typing this text. I hope this one will do it 
more than just three weeks. I do know that this keyboard types 
delecious.

This is the end (I hope) of the story.
