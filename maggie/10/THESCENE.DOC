
 WHY THE ST-SCENE SUCKS A LOT

First of all I have to give you a brief explanation what I mean 
when I use the word "scene".

The scene is the home for all freaked-out computer addicts, doing 
stuff like demos, hacks or disk mags. If you want to be a member 
of the scene, you have to be more or less active in any form.

As everybody should have noticed by now, the Atari ST is a dead 
machine. The Commodore Amiga and some fucking MessyDOS 
machines (actually a whole shitload of them) have taken over the 
complete computer market. There's no space left for our old ST (I 
really avoided the words "good old" here). Many software houses 
have stopped releasing games, a lot of demo groups have retired.

When it comes to the question why the ST is dead now, most of the 
people blame the hackers. In my opinion all those guys are quite 
wrong. Not that I support piracy or such, hackers aren't the only 
ones to blame. 
Tell me : Why is the Amiga market still growing and growing 
although there's a far more experienced hacking scene than we 
ever had on the ST? Do you think the odd lamer would buy a 
computer if he didn't see the chance of getting some games for 
free? The hacking market on the ST was always very small compared 
to the Amiga one.

One reason for the ST's death is for sure the very limited 
hardware. Graphics and sound are really ridiculous and even the 
all so brilliant STE is nothing more than a pile of shit compared 
to the Amiga. Come on, 90% of all computer users are not 
interested in the really good user software available on ST or 
the OS (operating system). They simply care a shit about these 
things and they just want good games and demos.


But who really cares??? The "lusers" (mixture of a lamer and an 
user) always gave a damn about the scene. They said we're all a 
bunch of nerds, good for nothing. They still keep on laughing 
when you tell them that you're a demo coder. They ask "what's it 
good for? You're wasting your time". Not many Amiga-lusers ask 
this kind of question, believe me.

The ST-scene always was crap. Some few decent demo groups, most 
of them have stopped now. Very few good demos. Nowadays all the 
new demos give me the creeps. Always the same effects, always the 
same fucking stupid menues, always the same French bullshite to 
say the truth. I don't mean it as an insult since there are quite 
a few elite groups in France like Overlanders, Legacy, ST-
Connexion, NeXT, etc.
Where are all the Swedish groups? I haven't seen any major 
releases coming from Sweden lately! Some few years ago, this 
country was dominating the whole scene, but now? Nothing more 
than dust.

I still don't understand why most of the demos (including ours) 
were so pretty boring. We have very talented 
coders/painters/musicians on ST, some of them beat most of the 
Amiga coders/painters/musicians. It must be the "spirit" behind 
their demos, most of the ST demos look like a poor rip-off from 
Amiga demos.


Let me give you a short overview of all the major ST countries, 
their status some years ago and now...

 GERMANY:
In the beginning (87/88) THE leading country. Some really 
outstanding groups like The Exceptions, TNT-Crew, etc. with some 
major releases. A lot of enthusiasm at this time.
Now nothing more than Alliance, Respectables and us. Very few 
releases.

 SWEDEN:
The leading country in 88/89/90. ˆThe group was TCB, a lot changed 
with the release of the "Cuddly Demos". A lot more elite groups 
like Phalanx, Sync, Omega, Electra, and some more or less good 
ones. Still a lot of lame groups with no releases but a big 
mouth. Not that dominating country anymore, very few stuff coming 
from Sweden at the moment.
 
GREAT BRITAIN:
At the beginning, nothing more than lamers were in England. Then 
The Lost Boys (one of the true legendary elite groups on ST) 
released some astonishing demos. They have stopped now, too bad. 
Then there's Electronic Images and Chaos (a promising group). 
Ripped Off are doing some demo packs. Not to be forgotten is the 
very large hacking market in England, a lot of very good packers 
there like Automation, Pompey Pirates, Medway Boys and some more.
 
FRANCE:
Sad but true, this country rules the ST scene now. As mentioned 
before there are some good groups but there's also an incredible 
number of lame groups. Like in the last days of the Amstrad CPC, 
France was the last country where this computer had any 
importance.

Countries like The Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark and 
Finland never were able to dominate the scene for one day. There 
are just a few groups worth a mention. Synergy from Holland is 
one of the most promising groups and of course ULM from 
Luxembourg.
Outside Europe there is NO ST scene at all, regardless of some 
Australian crews.
 

Some people think that lazyness rules, but that's certainly 
wrong. Lazyness killed our machine. Eat this!


So my prognosis for the future is simple. The ST will expire a 
painful death very soon.
When Atari will finally release the Falcon 30 (read issue 9 for 
more information) and if this machine keeps what the rumours say, 
a lot of people will change to it. And I also think that quite a 
few Amiga owners will change, too. Hope we will have a different 
and more active scene then. BUT: If the Falcon will be same kind 
of rushed crap like the ST, hasta la vista Atari.



Hate me now, I don't mind at all

P.S.: We want YOUR opinion! Write to us, preferably an ASCII-
document, we will print your opinion in the next issue. If 
there's no interest from your side, we will stop with MAGGIE 
and/or leave the ST scene forever (at least yours truly).
