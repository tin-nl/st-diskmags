
 How to do a g ood demo!

†„(an article done by Slime)†

As the headline of this article is 'How to do a good shag', oops! 
Sorry! ;-) I meant 'demo', I try to explain what 'I' want to see in 
a demo and what not.
First of all there are many maaaaany crap demos flying around and 
only some ˆreal brilliant masterpieces of code, graphics and sound!
Just to show you a little bit of my taste, I'll tell you my 
favourite demos. They are:

Oh Crickey, wot a scorcher! (The Lost Boys), Union demo, The Cuddly 
demos (The Carebears) and some more...
(By the way, you always have to remember the release date of the 
demos to be objective!!)
I can't give you any names of shite demos because I don't use my 
brain capacity to save such unimportant data (Wow! What an arrogant 
sentence! Harharhar!).

The most important thing you have to remember if you want to do a 
demo is that originality, good design and new technics are the most 
wanted stuff people like. So don't bore them with a-zillion-times-
seen fullscreens or crappy colourshocks!
If you have to show the whole world what a good coder you are - ok! 
But don't do it by producing one after the other fullscreen (and the 
only difference between them are the scroll texts and the needed CPU 
time!). And to stay at scrolltexts; a scroller has to look good, 
should be readable (but don't have to be!), AND it has to be 
interesting! Don't write gigabytes of crap like: 'I ate 10 kg of 
crisps while coding this screen', or 'My dog had the flu while I 
was doing this screen'. Beware of such stuff! I know it is 
difficult to write a good scroller (at least if you're writing the 
scroll text of the last screen of a 'Mega Demo', but you have to 
try it!). And by the way, do you really think every screen has to 
have a scoller? I don't think so anymore!
Another important rule for doing an - at least - nice demo is the 
precision in doing the work. Never say 'Uhh the rasters are 
flickering a bit, but I'm too lazy to do it better', or something 
like that. If you start doing this, your demo is doomed to be 
just mediocre! Because other people will think you are NOT ABLE to 
do it better!!! In some demos I saw things like wrong cutted fonts 
or graphics with a wrong palette! If you do such mistakes, too, a 
demo reviewer will bash your brain out of your skull (at least I 
will do it!). Hmmm.. I know that it isn't nice but the latest demos 
I remember (and that's a compliment when I can remember a demos 
name!) which failed in precision are: 'Pandemonium' by „Chaos and 'My 
socks are weapons' dentro by „Legacy. The Legacy dentro was good but 
there was one thing in it that makes me puke (especially me as I'm a 
grafics man!). There were some letters in the scroller which have 
contact to each other (that means some letters were too wide!) and 
that makes the scroller looks shite (at least for me!).
But the best example for the failure in precision is the latest 
Chaos demo. Ben, I hope you won't mind at all, but if some people 
can learn from your mistakes then this would be a big success!
Well, what has he done? There were flickering rasters, a jerking 
screen, bugs in the colourshock and crappy animation. (You might 
think that the demo was completly crap but it wasn't! It was really 
good (read MAGGIE 9 for a review)). If he had avoided at least half 
of the above mentioned mistakes he had got a better rating in the 
review easily.
Stop criticizing other people now. I hope they don't kill me 
because I show them their mistakes (I never would be angry if 
another person showed me things I can do better, if he does it in 
an objective way!).
Before I forget it - the next demo, dentro, intro, etc. that uses 
70hz in the beginning will get MINIMUM two points less in the 
rating as it would get without the 70hz rubbish! That's no threat - 
that's a LAW! Even as a really unexperienced guy in coding I know 
that my colour monitor runs in 50hz or 60hz and it's not harmless 
to switch it to 70hz! So stop that silly stuff dumbfuckers (that 
was meant as an insult and I don't care about any reaction!)!
The next rule is: Do not copy whole demos from the Amiga or other 
computers. That sucks! But if you do it anyway, then you should be 
that fair to give the credits to the group you copied (even they are 
bastards!). I don't mean that copying ideas from other groups and / 
or computers is bad (Delta Force did it several times) but if you 
copy it, then it has to contain better code and some little NEW 
effects. And: If you saw a good screen on Amiga but are unable to 
do a good conversion then better don't use it instead of making a 
fool of yourself!!
To tell you something about good design, here are some basic rules:

1. You should be possible to exit ALL screens, intros, etc. when 
ever you want. (Some demos had crap intros you had to look till the 
end! That was extremly boring and I hate it like hell!!)

2. If you decide to do a demo which runs like a movie it would be a 
nice idea to include an optional menu (available by pressing help) 
so if I would like to see a single effect I don't have to look at 
all the stuff for hours. But that's only an advice from me.......

3. Don't show the same effects too often. E.g. don't use all your 
three-dimensional stuff at once (showing ten and more of them makes 
me screaming!). Split it!

4. If you do a reset screen, then please think about Mega ST's! They 
have the reset button at a difficult place to reach (you always 
have to stand up from your chair to press this nipple (at least New 
Mode has to do it)). Make it in a way that it is possible to leave 
the screen by pressing space but don't forget to exit the screen by 
pressing reset twice too! And perhaps include the Control-
Alternate-Delete keyboard reset! That's the best way. And never do 
a reset part you only can exit if you switch off your computer!!

5. Hold the menu, loading screen and reset part in memory (only for 
1 meg and more). And if you have a screen which is too big to hold 
everything in memory, then you have to decide which part you skip. 
Please, try to use the available memory capacity - on a 4 meg 
computer I don't want to see the same disadvantages as on half meg 
ones (reloading menu, etc.). Do a CLEVER concept! (I know it is 
always bad if you praise the own stuff, but 'Punish Your Machine' 
had a real good concept - not brilliant, but good! There was an 
optional menu; menu, reset and loading part was held in memory (on 
1 meg and more!) and you could exit the reset screen by pressing 
'Space' or 'Reset' twice).

If you do a hiddenscreen, then you should give some hints how to 
reach it in the demo or - and that's nice too - tell a disk 
magazine (like MAGGIE or ST-NEWS of Richard Karsmakers and Stefan 
Posthuma) the way how to get there. By the way, if the key to reach 
the hiddenscreen is a password then PLEASE, all you Frenchies, 
think about your strange keyboard that doesn't fit to the rest of 
the world! I just say AZERT and QWERT! Do it in a kind that it 
possible to enter the password on all ST's in a normal way.
Another important topic is the style of the demo menu. Jesus H. 
Fucking Christ - that's really the most important thing! Just let us 
think that you've done a demo with well code, nice grafics and 
earblasting sound... And NOW you have this BIG idea to do the menu 
like a jump'n'run game, 'Dungeon Master' looking or - much worser - 
like a shoot'em'up (like NTM-demo by Zuul). Oh boy! If you do this 
I'll rip your nuts! WE HAD  ENOUGH OF THOSE 'EXTREMLY'„  FUNNY  
MENUS!!! Think about new ideas to do one! But if you have to do it 
in this kind anyway, please, do an optional menu (reachable without 
any password or tricks, but simple by pressing HELP for example!).

Well, what's left to mention? I don't know..... Hmmmm? Should I tell 
you that you don't have to slander in your scroll texts? No, I don't 
think so - you must know it on yourself, if you can bear the 
reactions of annoying other people.
One thing left to mention. If you own a megabyte or more computer 
then please use it! Do a demo just running on ONE meg! The halfmeg 
pissheads should fuck off or buy an extension! If you are such a 
person, then why you don't buy a single-sided drive to complete 
your collection of worse computer equipment?

That's the end of this crappy article! Feel free to write MAGGIE 
your opinion about a good demo or - if you want - to tell me to piss 
off if you think that I am completely wrong with this article. Or 
perhaps I have forgotten something important? And send MAGGIE an 
article about your opinion of 70Hz in bootsectors and the reasons 
why you like / use it or not!
