    Reasons

        Reasons
        They keep giving reasons
        They say in these seasons
        The season is blood

        Reasons
        They keep giving reasons
        They say in these seasons
        The season is blood

        Let the dogs
        Let the dogs
        Let the dogs lie
        And then
        Let the dogs
        Let the dogs
        Let the dogs die
        With you

        I know that you don't want to be
        Out of here
        I know that you have got that
        Inner fear

        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other

        The city is aching from
        Two thousand years
        The city is rattling with a
        Million fears

        Reasons
        They're looking for reasons
        They say in this season
        The season is death

        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other

        The city in dusk
        Her amber belly
        Her velvet eyes

        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other

        Reasons
        There's got to be reasons
        They say in these season
        The season is fear

        Let the child
        Let the child
        Let the child speak
        Let the child
        Let the child
        Let the child wreak
        Havoc

        Its blood spilling under the
        Cedar tree
        Its blood saying that you're
        On your knees

        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other

        The city in dusk
        Her amber belly
        Her velvet eyes
        Her lovers that lust
        Her favours many
        With no disguise

        Over run by one
        Over run by the other
        Over run by one
        Over run by the other

        The city in dusk
        Her amber belly
        Her velvet eyes

        Over run by one
        Over run by the other



    Lakeside drive

        Lakeside drive
        On a summers day
        Lakeside drive
        Nothing to say
        Lakeside drive
        Got a leave today
        Nothing, but nothing to keep me away

        Old junk car with the windows down
        Ride it out to the right side of town
        Too hot to breathe, look see the people seethe
        I hope you know that I don't want to leave
        Lakeside drive
        On a summers day
        Lakeside drive
        Nothing to say
        Lakeside drive
        Got a leave today
        Nothing, but nothing to keep me away

        Stick shift drive with one hand on the wheel
        No need to look because I know how you feel
        Roll of the street leaving the street behind
        Turn in the basement see what else we can find
        In the basement then it's the safest place
        In the basement then it's just my face
        Looking up at you as you're looking down on me
        Now this is the place where I know I want to be 
        Looking up at you as you're looking down on me
        Now this is the place where I know I want to be 

        Lakeside drive
        On a summers day
        Lakeside drive
        Nothing to say

                              I give to you

        Always told to take more care
        but touch that skin
        and you'd be there
        A voice so clear but far away
        picking up on every word I say
        To tell the truth I can't even lie
        no politician or a secret spy

        I give to you
        I give to you
        No one else can make me
        You pick me up and take me
        You got it, you got it
        My soul, it lies
        My heart, it tries
        My mind, is spent
        My love...
        You can take it all
        at your beck and call
        I will give to you
        I will give to you
        I will give to you

        I get up out of bed
        I'm not alone, but nothing's said
        I leave the room and go outside
        sunlight splash with every stride
        To tell the truth I don't even try
        A life in knots that I don't untie

        My soul, it lies
        My heart, it tries
        My mind, is spent
        My love...
        You can take it all
        At your beck and call
        I will give to you
        I will give to you
        At your beck and call
        I will give to you
        I will give to you

        When the rain is falling
        and the wind is calling
        When the rain is falling
        and the wind is calling
        I give to you
        When the rain is falling
        and the wind is calling
        When the rain is falling
        and the wind is calling
        I give to you
        I give you life
        I give you life
        I give you life 
        At your beck and call
        I will give to you
        I will give to you

    
                              Sugar Sweet

        I've seen you
        all skin and bone
        eyes grey as stone
        heart good as gold
        you think nothing cold
        and I've listened to you
        when you go out
        you sing and shout
        you say alright
        and that's alright
        sugar sweet

        Come and see just what's outside
        who's told the truth and who has lied
        take you in, into their arms
        hold you back and hold you down
        hold you back and hold you down

        sugar, sugar sweet
        saccharine to the bitterness you'll meet
        sugar, sugar sweet

        you say words that don't mean a thing
        but this world turns with the touches you bring
        take it in, into your hands
        throw it back and throw it down

        money maker always rattles his shaker
        if there's a giver he's always a taker
        take you in, into his arms
        and hold you back

        sugar, sugar sweet
        saccharine to the bitterness you'll meet
        sugar, sugar sweet

        don't hold it back
        hold it back
        don't hold it back
        hold you back
        don't hold it back
        sugar, sugar sweet
        don't hold it back
        sugar, sugar sweet
        don't hold it back

   DJ VD

        I'm looking 'bout and listenin' good
        used to dance and now I stand
        can't recall if I changed
        fact remains things ain't the same
        look up about and listen good
        take your bunce and that's not all
        the more they scratch, the more you'll itch
        it's a condition we'll have to cure

        dj vd, dj vd
        it won't get me
        originality deficiency
        take your decks and swivel

        don't you try to tell me
        how to live my life
        don't you try to tell me
        what's honey and what is spice
        dj pull the plug on that

        standing in a bar, feet on the floor
        chilling out and digging the scene
        seems like it used to be really fun to do
        things ain't always how they seemed

        looks like the emphasis is changing here
        a significant and ominous twist
        it's confusing and frustrating
        utterly deflating
        in fact it gets me utterly pissed

        so listen good, and look about
        go ahead and tell me what you see
        this is a terminal disease
        and we've got to set us free
        cos looks like a midas in reverse
        the things they touch they curse
        and smother with the killer pumping bass
        the issue they're confusing
        themselves they are deluding
        I guess they've got a terminal case

        dj vd, dj vd
        it won't get me
        originality deficiency
        take your decks and swivel

        don't you try to scare me
        out of what I am
        don't you try to scare me
        your money in your hand
        dj pull the plug on that

        dj vd, dj vd, dj vd
        dj vd, dj vd, dj vd

        don't you try to tell me
        how to live my life
        don't you try to tell me
        what's honey and what is spice
        don't you try to scare me
        out of what I am
        don't you try to scare me
        your money in your hand



                                 Time

        I woke up from a trap
        hit me just like a slap
        took the weight of my ass
        and filled up another glass

        I need time to drink
        leaving not much to think
        with you off my back
        I will be back on the track

        I need to disappear
        to change my name it's clear
        no-one to listen
        and no eyes to glisten
        when I have got something to say
        I will hope, I will pray
        sweet nothing is to come my way

        I need to disappear
        to change my name it's clear
        no-one to listen
        and no eyes to glisten
        when I have got something to say
        I will hope, I will pray
        sweet nothing is to come my way

        I want to make undone
        all I have been making
        I don't care that I'm going away
        I don't care that you're gonna stay
        you said that I should look
        but I am off that hook
        you said that you would wait
        you can forget that bait
        don't make me stop
        you told me to look
        but I'm off that hook
        you said that you'd wait
        you can forget that bait

        oh time
        to think
        think about this
        thinking 'bout all the things I'd miss
        no, no I don't care
        i don't care


    Ascend

        I first saw you
        without love and then you knew
        your fingers reached
        I moved in the distance breached

        tell me what I'm doing here
        tell me what I'm doing here

        to my surprise
        I kissed you, you made me rise
        now by my side
        I've missed you and let it slide

        tell me what I'm doing here
        tell me what I'm doing here

        if all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
        if the thing that I said, they just weren't true
        ascend, ascend my friend

        I turned my head
        and looked back, I had been led
        when my heart jumped
        we lost touch, our love had slumped

        tell me what I'm doing here
        tell me what I'm doing here

        if all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
        if the thing that I said, they just weren't true
        ascend, ascend my friend

        I can see you looking down to keep away from me
        but I'm stuck with this lack of ability
        I can't refrain
        from coming here
        it causes pain
        you're so sincere
        ascend, I must ascend

        so now alone
        I find out your heart is stone
        a helping hand
        there is none from where I stand
        tell me what I'm doing here
        tell me what I'm doing here

        if all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
        if the thing that I said, they just weren't true
        then don't restrain from telling me
        that all this pain is good for me
        I can see you looking down to keep away from me
        but I'm stuck with this lack of ability
        I can't restrain from coming here
        it causes pain you're so sincere
        ascend
        ascend, I must ascend


   Godhead

        hey now what's this
        the place I'm living's a fucking disgrace
        don't talk 'bout that
        get on your knees and pray that you're safe

        but what to believe in
        it's all so deceivin'
        how about something else
        the times ain't changing
        it's what I been cravin
        how about something else

        where's this I'm at
        there's more excitement
        at a laundrymat
        who's he, mmm looks good
        he ain't a god
        well he fucking well should (be)

        now wait a minute, look at that
        he's a god without a doubt
        can't you see it in his eyes
        got all of you to despise

        and so they came
        and they called him godhead
        cried out his name
        and the life that he led
        so then he knew what he had to say
        hold out his hand and show them the way
        godhead

        I can create
        but only masturbate
        they all believe
        what I got up my sleeve
        they cannot wait
        so I guess this is my fate

        now I'd like to know
        if this god he can go
        kissing hot jack and danny
        then take it real slow
        and now I can cry
        yes it's manly to die
        but real tears is now what I will try

        women, long legs
        imbalance to be redressed
        if I'm a god
        can't keep shooting my load on my own
        now bend on down
        and receive your crown
        I'll give you a necklace to wear

        well yeah god is strange
        but not sex deranged
        no he wouldn't do that with a chair
        got a feeling something is happening here
        yeah I think it's all coming clear

        and so they came and they called him
        godhead
        cried out his name and the life that he led
        so then he knew what he had to say
        hold out his hand and show them the way
        godhead

        now if a holy grail
        carries a semen trail
        I guess we can think that god has gone bad
        but look at it my way
        I fucked up on every day
        yeah I know where there's fun to be had

        OK so I'll leave
        didn't mean to deceive
        just look after the debris I've left

        and so they came and they called him
        godhead
        cried out his name and the life that he led
        so then he knew what he had to say
        hold out his hand and show them the way
        godhead
        godhead
        godhead


    Trigger Happy

        now picture the scene
        it's downtown after the show
        I'm looking around
        but there's no-one I'd like to know
        then I see her
        yeah I think those looks would kill
        maybe she won't
        but then again maybe she will
        I'm trigger happy
        just thinking that she'd blow me away
        trigger happy
        I'm trigger happy
        but she won't even look my way
        trigger happy

        my mind is moving
        as the music is swinging her hips
        my body quivers
        when her tongue caresses her lips
        I'm easy prey
        yeah I know that I'm looking scared
        she starts to smile
        cos it looks like I'm nearly snared
        she's trigger happy
        but she knows it could go either way
        trigger happy
        she's trigger happy
        cos it looks like we're both gonna stay
        ah yeah she's looking at me
        pointing a gun kind of nervously
        on my back
        from a fatal attack
        through the heart
        and that's just the start
        loaded chamber, silver bullets gleaming
        check out the beat, you be feeling
        trigger happy
