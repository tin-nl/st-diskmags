
CHAPTER FIVE

     April of that year left in a hurry and most of May hurried, 
too. I didn't get the chance to stay out at Charlene's again right 
away, but I knew Roger hadn't forgotten me. One Saturday morning 
there was a gorgeous little bookcase, just the right size, in the 
driveway beside our house. It was solid mahogany and beautifully 
finished and the card taped to it just said, "An early birthday 
present for a very special young lady." It was signed, only, "A 
secret admirer." I pretended utter ignorance, but sent Roger a 
thank-you note on the sly.
     I didn't get many chances for adventure and I was pretty much 
finished with kids near my age and there weren't any real prospects 
among the older guys or men in the neighborhood. I was walking 
around in a state of constant horniness, relieved only slightly by 
occasional games of stink-fink with Jeanne. That last week of May 
dragged on and Memorial weekend seemed to last forever. Dad went on 
a rampage on Memorial day because, apparently, of my sister, St. 
Alexis the Pure.
     Alexis always went around passing judgment and telling us 
things were wrong or sins. Anything. Everything. And here she'd 
gotten herself caught jerking off some jock in a Dodge. In the 
driveway. We're not talking about a Nobel Laureate here, as you can 
plainly see.
     On the next Saturday, good ol' Marty came snuffling around. He 
had his permit and his Dad's old car and offered to take me for a 
drive. Well, sure, I knew what he had in mind, but I was so horny 
at that point, I would've sat on his stickshift. So we went for a 
drive by the Anderson's grain elevator -- romantic, huh? -- and we 
did it and then he drove me home. And I was still horny.
     Finally, on the third week of June, Dad announced that my 
phantom step-brother was coming to visit. I was determined to 
seduce him -- and I was going to have the chance, because his visit 
was going to coincide with the church fair.
     When Dan arrived, Jeanne and I -- we had been exchanging 
fantasies and making plans for two weeks -- were all prepared. We 
were both going to do him. Teeheehee.
     He was even better-looking than before; other than that, he 
hadn't changed much. He still sat up till three in the morning, 
reading paperbacks and anything else he could get his hands on. 
We'd been counting on that. Jeanne and I would come creeping 
downstairs at eleven or so, after everyone else was asleep, and sit 
on the floor or the couch -- anywhere we could be sure the light 
would show through our nightgowns. He slept on a pullout in the 
living room and we'd come through there in the middle of the night, 
wearing a pair of panties and, maybe a tee-shirt, maybe not.
     He was getting all these nice hard-ons from us, but never did 
anything. So we went to Plan B, which we considered foolproof.      
Three nights before he was supposed to fly back to New York, Mom 
and Dad were going to a pre-carnival dinner for all the volunteers, 
and my brothers were staying at Grandma's and Alexis had this 
Really Big Date. Dan was left to watch over us. At nine o'clock, he 
sent us to take our baths. At nine-thirty -- after we had spent 
most of the time plying Yellow Pages with each other -- I called 
downstairs to him.
     This was the foolproof part:
     "What's the matter?"
     "You have to make sure we're clean."
     "What??!!?"
     "That's what Mom or Dad always does."
     He muttered something and came trudging up the stairs. Jeanne 
and I popped out into the hallway butt-naked and stood there 
wearing shit-eating grins, displaying all of our sleek little 
charms and secret places. Our nipples were hard enough to pierce 
paper when he topped the stairs and turned toward us.
     Dan took one look at us, blushed, stared me right in the eye 
and said, "Get dry, get dressed, get to bed -- and don't ever pull 
this shit on me again. Get moving!"
     We moved. So much for foolproof plans.
     [What? No, I think he liked what he saw. Remember, I had a 
terrific little figure -- 26-19-25 -- and Jeanne was just 
sprouting, so she wasn't too hard to look at, either. But he 
thought of us as "kids" first and "females" second. Seems pretty 
obvious to me.]
     Anyhow.
     Marty  had been calling a couple of times a day and asking me 
to come to this "party." The day after Jeanne and I pulled our 
foolproof plan on Dave, Marty finally admitted what was happening. 
Y'see, Marty was junior varsity football at Rossford High and he 
was trying to buddy up to the in-crowd with the varsity. The party 
was going to consist of Marty, three guys from the varsity -- and 
me. Get the picture?   Right: a gangbang. I told him to call Dana -
-  since that was more her speed -- but he said No, he wanted me to 
do it. He started to get real pushy about it. It upset me, but I 
didn't tell anyone.
     So the next evening, about five-thirty, I was out on the front 
porch with Lisa and Dan was sitting there reading the Toledo Blade. 
Marty pulled up with his three would-be buddies. Marty and one of 
them -- Eric, the halfback -- got out and came up on the the porch 
with him. Marty had filled out and Eric was just big. I remember 
there were clouds coming in and the wind had stopped. I could feel 
the thunder in the sky, just waiting to start.
     I introduced Marty to Dan -- he just waved and went back to 
the his sports pages; he was a real baseball nut -- and Marty 
introduced Eric to Lisa and Dave and me. Eric was wearing a muscle 
tee-shirt and he had the right to wear it. I was wearing a pair of 
shorts that were too small and a loose blue pullover. I was wishing 
I'd worn a bra, since my nipples were hard and pushing against the 
fabric.
     "Well, are you going to come with us to the party?" Marty 
asked.
     I told him the same thing I'd said on the phone: "I don't want 
to, Marty. Get someone else to play with you."
     "We want YOU," Marty said.
     "Cute girl like you could have a real good time with us," Eric 
said.
     Dan turned the page on the sports section.
     "I just don't want to," I said.
     "Sure you do," Eric said. He was staring right at my tits.
     Dan folded the paper and set it down on the floorboards of the 
porch.
     "No, I don't!" I said. "Why don't you guys go on to your old 
party and just leave me alone?"
     Marty put his hand on my arm, just above the elbow and started 
to lean toward me, whispering something. I shook free and backed 
away. "I think you better go, Marty."
     Dan was sitting there with his feet up on the porch rail and 
his hands folded across his stomach, just watching us. I was 
backing up and backed right into Eric. He grabbed my forearms from 
behind and pulled me back against him. I felt his dick rubbing 
against me. I tried to get loose. He didn't get shaken off as  
easily as Marty.
     "She said to let her go."
     Dan was standing and he was close. The top of his head was 
barely even with Eric's chin.
     Eric turned toward him, still holding my forearm in one hand.
     "You're not being polite," Dan said.
     "And what're you -- "
     He never finished what he was saying. I was maybe a foot away 
when Dan hit Eric in the face. It was a weird, short punch so fast 
that I hardly saw his hand move and didn't even really see the 
punch. Later I learned it was some kind of karate punch. At the 
time, though, all I knew was that Eric was staggering back with 
blood all over his face. He went back about two steps and fell flat 
on his ass, just sitting there looking dumb. Dan turned on one foot 
and kicked Marty's ankles out from under him. Marty went down. One 
of the other guys -- I think it was Mark -- was out of the car and 
running up the porch steps. Dan grabbed one of the aluminum lawn 
chairs we used on the porch and scooped it underhand at him. Mark 
put his hands up to deflect the chair and Dan kicked him in the 
knee. Something cracked and Mark fell down. Eric was up again and 
Dan hit him backhanded with his fist, right across the face and 
that was it for Eric. The last guy, Timmy, was coming up the stairs 
at the same time Marty was getting up. Dan's back was to him, so I 
don't know how he knew, but when Marty tried to tackle him, Dan 
just kind of half-turned, caught Marty's arm and helped him keep 
going -- right off the end of the porch. I think he was trying to 
throw Marty into Timmy, but Tim side-stepped.
     "Let's get it on, motherfucker," Dan said and stepped toward 
him. Tim started to raise his hands. Dan hit him five times real 
fast: in the face with his open palm, then a punch in the stomach, 
then another punch low -- right in his balls -- then another punch 
high in the belly and then he hit him square in the face with 
another punch that went so fast I hardly saw it.
     Now, I knew Dan lived in a bad neighborhood in Brooklyn and I 
knew he'd studied judo or karate or something, but he was always so 
nice and patient, and always trying to mollify people that -- well, 
I never expected anything like this. I'd even figured him for some 
kind of chicken, 'cause he always tried so hard to avoid trouble. 
The whole thing hadn't lasted more than thirty seconds. There were 
high school athletes all over the place and they were all hurt.
     Lisa just sat there on the porch railing, staring.
    Marty was out cold  where he'd landed and Tim was the same. 
Mark just lay there holding the knee and crying. Eric finally 
managed to stand on the third or fourth try and said he was going 
to call the police.
     "Yeah," Dan said. "Call the cops. Tell them how four football 
heroes got jumped by one bookworm from Brooklyn and got the shit 
kicked out them. And don't forget to mention the four jocks were 
trying to force an eleven-year-old girl to go to a 'party' with 
them." He threw a dime on the porch floor in front of Eric. "Go on. 
Call them." He laughed. "Asshole." He laughed again. I never want 
to hear anyone make that particular sound again; it was like 
listening to Hell enjoying a cruel practical joke.
     Tim and Marty were coming around. With Eric, they got Mark in 
the car and left. Marty backed into a trash can with the Challenger 
on the way out of the driveway.
     Jeanne stuck her head out of the door -- she'd been upstairs 
taking a shower; I never knew anyone who took so many showers -- 
and asked, "Hey, you guys -- what's all the noise?"
     Dan had retrieved the aluminum chair and was just sitting down 
again. "Chair fell," he said and started reading the paper again.
     Lisa was still staring.
     Jeanne  said, "Oh," and went back inside. I went to Lisa and 
touched her arm. She shivered and said, "I think I'm gonna be 
sick."
     "Great," Dan said, not looking up. Lisa slid off the rail and 
scampered off the porch, heading for home. I turned to my phantom 
step-brother.
     "I don't want you or Lisa blabbing about this," he said, 
without looking up.
     "What do you mean?"
     "Just what I said. They're not  going to tell anyone what 
happened and if you and Lisa keep your mouths shut, this'll be the 
end of it."
     "But -- "
     "But nothing. If you  start talking about it, though, your 
ferocious foursome will have to get even -- and since I won't be 
here all the time, they'll take it out on you. Just shut up about 
it. Got it?"
     He looked up at me. I nodded, went to him, threw my arms 
around him and gave him a big kiss, right on the lips. Then I ran 
into the house and stayed in the bathroom for about an hour, just 
shaking.
     I saw some of them around town after that and I saw Marty in 
school, but none of them ever said a word to me. I always returned 
the favor. Later I found out they'd explained their injuries as 
being the result of horsing around playing basketball at Navarre 
park.
     What was kind of funny, though, was they were all cute and I 
was so horny and frustrated, I would've gone with any of them or 
even all of them if they hadn't been such damn animals about it. 
After a week -- and Dan had gone back to New York for another year 
-- I was fantasizing about what it might have been like and kind of 
regretting the missed opportunity. But over July Fourth weekend, 
Dad borrowed Uncle Charlie's summer house on Kelly's Island and 
took us all out there and I got the chance to find out what it was 
like to pull a train.
     Kelly's Island is out in Lake Erie. You get there by a ferry 
from near Port Clinton. In the winter, when the lake is really 
frozen, sometimes you can get there by sled or ice boat or even 
car, but every year a couple of dweebs go through the ice and drown 
while they try that. It's some sort of national park -- at least 
part of it is -- and there's all this stuff left over from when the 
glaciers gouged the Great Lakes out of the continent. It's very 
quiet, very pretty...and very dull -- to a young person with an 
active libido.
     I was less than thrilled by the time we got to the house, a 
big ol' place about halfway up a hill and looking northeast over 
the lake. Dad and Mom were doing Dad-and-Mom stuff -- Mom was 
cleaning and organizing and Dad was looking for things to fix. My 
little brothers had discovered a treehouse and were as happy as 
'coons in a garbage dump. Jeanne loved that nature stuff and 
immediately headed out for the wildlife trails. Alexis, with her 
blonde hair and big ass, had gotten herself picked up by some 
lumbering islander on the ferry; he had a red Mustang convertible, 
so she had everything she needed.
     All I had was an itch and two weeks of boredom to look forward 
to. Or so I thought.
     The house  was against the side of a steep hill. Above us was 
all forest and the top of the hill was part of the national park-
land, so it was pretty much deserted. It was a good place to get 
away from Mom's nagging and Dad's cussing and my brothers' shouting 
and bickering. There was a very faint trail climbing up the hill in 
a series of cutbacks. I was wearing some cutoff jeans -- these were 
cut just above my knees -- and I'd filched one of Alexis's halter 
tops. It fit, which was a nice change of pace for me, since I'd 
started sprouting again. I'd thought about shopping for a real 
swimsuit, but when I measured myself, I was up to 27-19-25. So much 
for a real swimsuit.
     About two-thirds of the way to the top, a dog suddenly 
appeared from the bush. He wasn't very big and he was purebred mutt 
with a lot of basset in him. He stopped, looked at me, then wagged 
his tail and came right over, his great big eyes looking up at me. 
I let him sniff my hand and whine and when he rubbed his head 
against my fingers, I started scratching around his ears and under 
his jowls. His tail wagged even more. We chased each other up the 
trail a little and then he barked once, in enthusiasm. He didn't 
have a collar, and I kind of hoped he was a stray. He was a neat 
dog.
     Then someone whistled form the cliff. He barked once at me and 
started scooting up the trail. I followed.
     Just as I huffed past the top of  the trail, I saw about a 
half-dozen kids on blankets. The kids looked like they were about 
sixteen or so, some older, some -- the girls -- maybe a little 
younger. The dog was with one of the guys, who was watching me.
     I said Hi and  introduced myself and told him what a neat dog 
he had.
     His name was Ike. He and the  other kids there lived on the 
island. He was about a foot taller than me and not bad looking, but 
boy, did he have a built on him! The fact that he was shirtless 
made it hard to miss, too. They invited me to hang out with them 
and I was glad they did, since it meant some variation at least. 
The boys all checked me out -- so did the girls -- but no one came 
on to me ... then. The girls seemed a little stand-offish. That 
made sense. Kelly's Island isn't big and in a place like that, when 
the girls get paired off with boyfriends, they don't want newcomers 
to upset the balance of things. But when they found out I wasn't 
going to be twelve for a couple of weeks, most of them relaxed. One 
of them, Reenie -- her real name was Maureen -- offered to meet me 
at the house the next day and show me a short cut. I thought that 
was nice.
     Reenie was sixteen and had a nice face and real dark, straight 
hair -- she said her great-grandmother was an Indian -- but the 
most noticeable things about her were her tits. She had these huge 
boobs, I mean, they had to be as big as cantaloupes. When she came 
to the house to call for me, Dad kept staring at her tits like he'd 
never seen breasts before. As we were walking to the shortcut, I 
warned her as much as I dared about Dad. I told her he was going to 
be grabbing at her tits if he got her alone -- Dad was notorious 
for that, especially if he'd had a couple of beers.
     She looked  at me and said, "You know, it's hard to believe 
you're only twelve."
     I smiled and said that was the way it was.
     She told me that when  she was my age, her tits were bigger 
than mine, but she was also taller. And she confided that she'd 
found the attention her figure got from boys was an interesting 
diversion from what had become a pretty boring routine.
     Since it was tell-all time, I took the bait and revealed that 
I was not exactly a little innocent. She set the hook and reeled me 
in and I told her a little of my exploits. She told me a little of 
hers, but not much.
     The same group was there plus a few more. Boys now outnumbered 
girls. I figured I'd better play it safe and not mess around, and 
assumed that all the boys were spoken for; no flirting by me, no 
siree bob.
     Some of  the boys were throwing a softball around and a couple 
of the girls were playing cards and it was nice. We all just laid 
around in the sunshine and enjoyed each other's company. From time 
to time, I noticed Reenie talking privately to one or two of the 
girls. From the way they looked at me after the chats, I knew what 
she'd told them. I didn't really mind, not even when I noticed some 
of the boys started looking at me different, too, after the girls 
talked to them. Later in the afternoon, a couple of couples paired 
off and were making out under an old elm. They were going at it 
pretty hot and heavy. One of the boys, Vernon, had been rubbing his 
girlfriend's rather scrawny tit and he was moving the other hand 
down between her legs. Ellen didn't stop him when he started 
rubbing her off through her shorts. She was so skinny that her 
brown legs were like two pipes sticking out of her shorts. There 
was enough room for him to get his fingers inside one leg of the 
shorts -- and he did. I knew from the way she was moving and he was 
moving that he was fingering her. They kept it up till she came, 
then he stood and led her by the hand back into the woods.
     Reenie said something  like "Those two are like rabbits." She 
looked at me and grinned a little crookedly. I nodded and said, 
"Lucky her; at least she's got a boyfriend with her." Then I looked 
at the cards in my hand and rummied the straight flush someone had 
played earlier.
     On the way back to my house, Reenie told me they were going to 
have a little weenie roast that night and I was welcome to come. 
She said almost everyone would be there, including some kids I 
hadn't met. She said that since it was going to be full moon, they 
might go for a swim in a pond back in the woods.
     It sounded great and I agreed.
     When Reenie came for me  at the house, it was almost six-
thirty. Mom and Dad had been drinking Blatz all afternoon and I 
knew they were going to be asleep early, which meant my brothers 
were going to be put to bed early. Alexis was, as usual, Out and 
Jeanne was in the bathroom, trying to drain the cistern -- as 
usual. I knew what she was really doing in there, but What the 
hell?
     When we got to the top, it was just getting dark. There were 
about fifteen kids there. Someone had built a real careful campfire 
in a depression scooped out of the dirt and a couple of kids were 
roasting weenies and marshmallows on sticks. Most of the kids were 
availing themselves of the beer someone had brought -- a couple of 
cases of Blatz and Carling. Vernon and Ellen were making out.      
I ate a frank and a couple of marshmallows. There was no soda, so I 
washed it down with cold beer. Ike was kind of hanging around me 
and there were these little touches now and then -- you know, on my 
wrist or my shoulder -- and when I went into the bushes to take a 
leak, I asked Reenie who his girlfriend was. She said she guessed 
she was, but said she and Ike weren't Like That and not to worry 
about it; cookout nights were special. She wouldn't explain more, 
but promised that if I stuck around, I'd understand.
     When I got back to  the group, all ready to let Ike give me 
some enjoyment, I found that he and about half of the others had 
gone off for their swim. I was wearing Alexis's swimtop and my 
bottoms under my shorts and windbreaker -- it got cool out there on 
the lake, even in midsummer -- so I was prepared. I followed the 
sounds of splashing till I got to the pond.
     The swimsuit was  not appropriate attire; birthday suits were 
the order of the day.
     I hesitated, but someone -- one of the guys -- yelled, "Come 
on, little girl! Don't be shy!"
     I peeled  out of my clothes and when I took the halter off, I 
heard a girl giggle and say, "Little?"
     I stripped  off the bottoms and went to the edge of the pond. 
One of the guys warned me not to dive because the pond bottom was 
uneven, so I waded in and struck out in a shallow crawl stroke 
toward the others. The pond was about eighty feet across and almost 
round. The far side of it was shrouded in shadows from overhanging 
trees. The others were in the middle of the pond. Ike was a little 
farther out, where it was deeper. He waved me toward him.
     The main bunch was in water about waist deep or a little more. 
As I swam past, someone reached out and ran a hand down my back to 
my butt and gave one cheek a little squeeze.
     Just Ike's head and shoulders  were above the water when I 
reached him. "Ever been skinny-dipping before?"
     "Not since I was a little kid," I said.
     "From what I saw, you're no little kid any more."
     "And from what you've heard."
     He nodded and grinned.
     "You guys do this a lot?"
     "Every  couple of weeks in summer. Weather's got to be right 
and there has to be enough moonlight and no Scout troops." He 
laughed. "We really upset a troop last summer. They kind of 
stumbled upon us."
     I'd been treading water for a couple of minutes at that point. 
     "You getting tired?" he asked.
     "A little," I admitted.
     He grinned and then I felt his hands on my waist. He pulled me 
closer until I was pressed against him. He kissed me and I was all 
for it. I wrapped my legs around his hard waist and my arms around 
his neck. He slid his hands down to cup my butt and ground me 
against him. I felt the hard ridges of muscle on his abdomen 
rubbing my clit. I was getting awfully hot. I scooted my behind 
down a little and, sure enough, I felt something smooth and hard 
bump against the little strip of flesh between my butt-hole and my 
pussy. Unfortunately, I was so much shorter than him that I 
couldn't possibly think about going farther without developing 
gills; my head would've been underwater.
     "Can we go someplace a little drier?" I asked.
     "Sure -- other side of the pond. Can you swim it?"
     I kissed him and nodded, then we disentangled and I turned to 
swim. He grabbed my ankles and gave me a push that sent me a good 
third of the way to the far side of the pond. I swam till my feet 
touched bottom, but he swam past me and was standing before I was. 
What a gorgeous sight he was, with that great body glistening in 
the moonlight. His cock was as long as Roger's had been, maybe 
eight inches, but not as thick. Certainly as hard, though. He held 
his hand out to me. I took it and stood and he led me out of the 
water and into the dark woods beyond. There were some hoots from 
behind us. I ignored them. I suppose in daylight and wearing shoes 
it would've taken about two minutes, but dressed as we weren't and 
by moonlight, the twisty path took about ten minutes.
     "Almost there," he whispered. We were approaching what looked 
like an impenetrable wall of bushes.
     "I hear something," I said. "Someone -- "
     "It's  okay." He put his hand on my butt and pushed aside some 
of the brush and urged me through.
     There were a couple of  old mattresses on the ground inside the 
ring of brush. Old sheets were on the mattresses. A couple was on 
one of the sheets. Ellen and Vernon; no surprise.
     I stopped and stared. Ellen was on her back under Vernon, her 
skinny legs bent back till her ankles were next to her ears. Her 
hairy cunt was pointed up and Vernon's dick was pumping in and out 
like crazy. From the amount of juices on the sheet and on her ass, 
I guessed that they hadn't just arrived.
     I already wanted Ike  desperately, but what he did then 
absolutely bound me to him. He bent and put his lips next to my 
ear, brushed back my wet hair and whispered, "If you want to  
change your mind, it's okay to do it now and no one's going to rag 
you for it; I guarantee that. But if you want to stop, now is the 
time. Okay?"
     I turned and kissed  him on the lips and grabbed his rigid 
dick. "Now is the time, alright." I dropped to my knees and pulled 
his dick into my mouth and started sucking as hard as I could. He 
groaned and put his hands on the sides of my face -- lightly, not 
forcing. I didn't want to suck him off, at least not right then. I 
wanted that hard cock in my pussy, scratching my itch. He didn't 
try to stop me when I pulled back. I led him, dick-wise, to one of 
the vacant mattresses and lay down. He lay beside me and kissed me 
for a while. We were caressing each other and then he bent down and 
started feasting on my tits. He kept stopping to tell me how 
perfect and firm and beautiful my tits were. Then he licked his way 
down my belly and licked my thighs and then he put his face between 
my legs.
     "Hey! You don't have any hair down here!"
     "Not so you'd  notice," I said, rubbing my palms over my 
swollen nipples.
     "Believe me, I'm in  a position to notice." He chuckled. I 
chuckled, too, but then his tongue ran slowly from my asshole all 
the way up my pussy lips to my clit and I stopped chuckling and 
started gasping. That boy knew how to eat! And the way he did it 
betrayed genuine enthusiasm. After about five minutes and five 
little orgasms, I pulled his face out of my cunt and dragged him up 
over me. I locked my legs around his waist and felt his dick head 
bumping around the area of my pussy, seeking the opening. I'd loved 
the way he ate me, but Jeanne could eat me just as well. What 
Jeanne couldn't do was slide a nice hard dick up my hungry little 
pussy and that's what I wanted.
     He  kept prodding and kept missing and I kept trying to catch 
his prick in my pussy, to no avail. Finally, I reached around and 
under and took matters into my own fingers. I guided his cock to 
the entrance, wriggled my hips till it was wedged securely, and 
then put my arms around his neck and whispered, "Fuck me, Ike!"
     He was  trying to ram me, but I was so little and tight that 
the going was too slow for either of us. I crossed my ankles behind 
his butt and hunched up at him, pulling myself onto his rigid cock 
as he pushed down into me. He glans slid inside and he gasped.
     "You're so tight! Are you a virgin?"
     "Not by a long shot! Just fuck me!"
     Well that was what he did. He  hooked his hands over my 
shoulders, resting most of his upper body weight on his elbows -- 
sparing me -- and started pumping. I was wet and tight, but he was 
wet and he was also hard and strong and he was moving his dick like 
a piston in me. I could hear the wet sucking noises my pussy made 
around his hard dick. Even with his moaning and my gasping, I could 
hear it.
     He pumped faster and faster. I hadn't cum yet, but I was going 
to soon -- and it was going to be a big one. I could feel it 
building in my belly, kind of coiling there like a big spring.
     "I gotta -- gotta  cum in you!" he hissed. He fell forward 
slightly, burying his prick in me. Our pubic bones were touching 
and he was pressing my clittie, too. I felt his balls slap on my 
upturned ass, into all the overflowing juices in the crack there. 
"Cumming -- cumming -- " he coughed.
     That did it for  me. I locked around him and felt my vagina 
start its squeezing and spasming. He howled and poured his jism 
into me. I could feel his dick swell with each spurt and that just 
sent me higher. Usually, I just get all clenched up and frozen when 
I come, but this time my hips started shaking against him and as 
tight as my cunt was, it must have felt to him like --      
     "Your cunt is sucking me! Damn!"
     He half-collapsed onto me, his dick  shriveling out of my 
clutches. He rolled onto his back, rolling me with him to keep his 
dick inside. I settled down onto his dwindling dick as much as I 
could and rested my head against his chest. He kissed the top of my 
head and ran his hands over me.
     "I want  to do it again, when you rest," I said. "I came so 
hard..."
     "Why wait till he rests?" said a voice. A girl's voice.


CHAPTER SIX

     I opened my eyes wide and looked up. A hard dick was throbbing 
above my head. I looked up farther. It was Vernon.
     "I mean, Vernon is ready if you are."
    To one side  stood Ellen, juice coating the insides of her 
thighs and matting her thatch of thick pubic hair.
     "But you -- "
     "Believe me, honey, Vernon is always ready! You won't wear him 
out!" She laughed. "Besides, Vern's been telling me he was wanking 
off last night imagining what you'd be like and that just made him 
hotter with me. Have fun -- I'm going to get some beers!"
     Vern started to kneel but Ike told him to back off; he didn't 
want Vern's balls right over his face. I crawled off Ike and looked 
a question at him.
     "It's okay with me," he said, "as long as you don't freeze me 
out!"
     "No chance."
     Ike grinned and winked. I knelt upright and pulled Vern's dick 
into my mouth. I tasted his juice and Ellen's on it. I didn't mind 
the taste, and the idea of it turned me on even more. Ike got 
himself on his back again and slithered forward till he had his 
face between my legs. He pulled my butt down till my cunt was in 
his mouth and started licking and sucking me some more. That just 
made me lick and suck good ol' Vern even more urgently. It wasn't 
long before my lips had Vern moaning and Ike's tongue had me 
moaning.
     Vern wanted to do it doggy style, which was new to me. Ike 
scuttled out of the way and Vern turned me onto my hands and knees 
and knelt behind me. My cunt was dripping and his cock was hard and 
he rammed right into me and started pounding. Ike stayed out of the 
way except to reach out and play with my nipples a little.
     Vern was hanging onto my hips and slamming into me and I was 
just rotating my bottom so his cock was always hitting in different 
places. I came a couple of times and then my arms just wouldn't 
hold me up any more, so I let my shoulders go down flat on the 
mattress. At that angle, Vern got even deeper into me. Then I felt 
his finger at my butt, but I was so busy cumming I didn't protest 
and to my surprise, it didn't hurt when it slid inside. In fact, I 
came some more, because it closed my cunt more around his cock -- 
as if my cunt wasn't tight enough already!
     But that extra tightness and my cumming put Vern over the edge 
and he came in me and pulled out. My butt settled onto my heels and 
I crouched them, just savoring the little aftershock orgasms. I 
looked up wide-eyed at the sounds of movement in the brush around 
us and saw most of the other kids were there. A few were couples 
busily coupling, but a lot of the others were just watching.      
Ike was sitting crosslegged a few feet a way. His gorgeous cock was 
stiff again. "I want you again," I croaked.
     "Are we letting her join?" someone -- Reenie -- asked aloud.
     "I guess so," Ellen answered.
     "Yeah," said Ike. "Let's do it."
     "What -- ?" I asked.
     "You want to do it again?" Ike asked.
     "Oh, yesss...."
     "It won't be my turn though. Okay?"
     "Turn?"
     I suddenly understood.
     He was watching me. The thought of all those cocks -- !
    I reached between my  legs and rubbed my pussy. "Do me," I 
whispered.
     Ike nodded to whoever was behind me, who then knelt, lifted my 
hips and fit his cock into me. I was plenty wet on my own and had 
two loads dumped in there and he slid right in. I groaned and kept 
my hand on my clit as he pumped my. I came again, a couple of 
times, then he did, too, and then someone else was sliding into me.
     "See, there's not many people our age on the island," Ike was 
explaining. He was stroking his cock and watching me get fucked at 
the same time -- and he was talking as if he were explaining how to 
change a tire. "Reenie and I went together when we were twelve--"
     "And went -- and went --" Reenie said, and laughed.
     "But then I got mixed up with  Helene and she started messing 
with Vern and then I got mixed up with Jill and she started 
throwing it to Bobby and Vern was doing it with Helene. And what 
was funny was we didn't stay jealous very long. When Bobby popped 
Ellen, she went and talked to Reenie and Reenie said it was okay 
and pretty soon, none of us really got jealous when whoever we were 
going with started messing with someone else -- from our group."
     The guy behind me came in me. Ike paused, watching me cum. I 
couldn't believe this was happening.
     "But someone came in here about two years ago -- "
     "Me!" called a pudgy girl. Doris, I think her name was.
     "And she got all upset when Vern -- "
     "Who else?" Ellen cracked.
     "Went for an  old-times'-sake roll with Helene. So Vern had 
this great idea and explained it to her."
     "And now," said  Reenie, kneeling beside me and caressing my 
face as I came yet again, "if someone new wants to play with any of 
us, you have to play with all of us. Helps keep anyone from getting 
possessive." She trailed her fingers down and trilled her nails 
over the side of my breast where it was pressed out by my weight on 
it. I shivered and came again.
     My cunt was vacant and I resented it. "More, please?"
     "Maybe it'd be better if -- well, I'd really like to be sucked 
off," someone said. "Do you mind?"
     "I want to cum some more, too," I said.
     "No problem," said  Reenie. She rolled me onto my side and 
started kissing and licking my cunt. Another pair of lips started 
kissing my butt and then a tongue was burrowing in between. "You 
have such a pretty little ass," Ike said from behind me.
     "Okay?" said a voice as I shivered through another orgasm from 
what Reenie was doing. A boy -- Bobby -- was laying on his side so 
his cock was presented to my mouth. It was enormous, as long as 
Roger's, but even thicker. I got most of the head in my mouth and 
sucked as hard as I could, considering my concentration was being 
ruined by the mouth on my cunt and the tongue tracing my ass, and 
the hand -- Reenie's -- that had come up to caress my tits. I put 
one hand on the shaft of Bobby's cock. I couldn't close my fingers 
around it. I pumped and stroked though, and it wasn't long before 
he was cumming. He'd been so sweet about it that I kept sucking 
when he flooded me with that hot, thick custard, and swallowed as 
much as I could. He came a lot and the idea of what I was doing 
drove me higher. I was absolutely stoned on sex.
     I don't know how many times I came that night. I do know that 
I passed out a couple of times but -- I was told -- I kept cumming 
even then. A couple of the girls ate me out and I ate them out and 
Vern stuck his tongue into my butt as much as he could. Most of the 
other girls got fucked, too. I know I fucked all the guys at least 
twice and some came back for thirdsies. And I loved every minute of 
it. For a while, I was getting fucked from behind by one guy while 
I sucked another one. After a bit I was too far gone to suck much, 
so I just let them move their cocks between my lips and when the 
one in my cunt came, the one in my mouth would move back there and 
another cock would be presented to my lips. Bobby, of course, came 
in my mouth every time. At one point I was being fucked from behind 
while I ate Reenie. That was so exciting it almost makes me cum 
just to think about it, especially since at the same time, she was 
sucking off -- who else? -- Bobby.
     Then came the most memorable part of all. Someone -- I think 
it was Walt -- pulled out as he was cumming and dumped his goo all 
over my butt. He held his cock right against my anus, not trying to 
probe, and let it squirt right on the opening. I didn't understand, 
but at that stage I wouldn't have understood instructions for 
dialing a telephone number. All I knew was that I was cumming 
almost constantly and I never wanted it to stop. My mouth was 
tired, my pussy was sore, but I wanted more!
     I got it. Oh, boy, did I get it!
     Ike lay on his back beside me and pulled me on top of him. He 
kissed me on the mouth, long and deep, right into all the sperm 
(mostly Bobby's) that had been dumped there as if he could care 
less, as if what mattered was kissing me. my legs slipped apart and 
I felt his cock against my thigh. I scooted down a little and he 
slid into me and I groaned as I settled down on it.
     I had my arms around his neck  and was pressed flat against 
him, just our hips moving and me, of course, cumming, when I felt 
someone kneeling back there. I felt a hard dick against my ass and 
knew what was coming. I wasn't sure but -- "Are you ready for 
this?" Ike asked.
     "Anything," I whispered. Ike nodded  and pulled my ass cheeks 
apart and pulled me down onto him.
     "I've  been wanting that beautiful little ass of yours since I 
first saw you," Vern said from behind and above me.
     Ike stayed  still in my cunt -- which was not staying still on 
him -- as Vern put the head of his dick against my tight little 
butt-hole. I stiffened, not sure about the discomfort. I tried to 
relax and open my butt and Vern pressed down and in a little. As my 
anus was forced open, my pussy squeezed Ike's dick and it twitched 
inside me. That felt good -- all the better for the extra 
compression.
     "Do  it, Vern," I croaked as loud as I could. "But slow and 
easy." For the moment, my orgasms had stopped.
     Vern did it. He pushed  a little more. I thought my ass was 
going to split -- and then the head of his dick popped past the 
sphincters.
     "Hold it right there for a minute," I gasped. I could feel the 
two dicks, hard and ready and eager. I tried to relax again, with 
little success, but after a few seconds I whispered, "Slow and 
easy."
     Vern did it  just that way, too -- slow and easy. But also 
nonstop. His implacable shaft slid steadily into me, probing deeper 
and deeper. I was grateful now for the load Walt had shot on my 
ass; it lubricated Vern's prick for the tight passage it was 
spreading. When he was halfway in I started groaning, a long sound 
that continued till I felt his pubic hair against my butt.
     "Just hold still for a minute, both of you, 'kay?"
     "Sure, baby," Ike said and kissed the top of my head. I moved 
my hips just a little, kind of an experiment. It didn't hurt but it 
wasn't comfortable yet, either. But I could feel those two hard 
young pricks buried to the bone in me, pressing against each other 
through the little membrane separating the parallel channels. I 
felt absolutely stuffed, fore and aft.
     "Careful, now," I said. Vern  moved a little, maybe a half-
inch, but I felt it as if it was a foot. I also felt the way it 
moved the compression of my cunt on Ike's dick, which twitched in 
response and sent a little shudder of pleasure through me. Ike 
moved his hips a little so his dick slid halfway out, then he 
pushed it all the way back in again.
     "You're so tight!" he gasped at me. "I don't think I can hold 
it!"
     I kissed his nipple and  nipped it lightly with my teeth. 
"Don't hold it," I said. "Fuck me hard."
     Well, he did, but Vernon thought I'd been talking to him, too. 
He pulled back till his glans was hung up on my sphincter and then 
he rammed into me. I bit Ike's chest -- tasted blood -- trying to 
stifle my scream. My cunt and ass tightened on both pricks.
     Ike was fucking in and out of me like a madman, moaning about 
how tight and hot and wet I was. Vern pulled back again and drove 
his cock into my ass. Again I bit Ike's chest and Vern moved faster 
and faster and then, suddenly, I started to have an orgasm.
     It was amazing, like breaking through to someplace new! I came 
and came and came and those two hard young cocks pumped me from 
both sides, stretching and reaming me and filling me. Vern fell 
flat atop me, adding his weight to mine on Ike, and flailed away, 
fucking my ass with short, hard little strokes as if he were 
pumping a cunt. Ike was sawing his longer dick in and out of my 
cunt. At one point they were syncopated, one moving in while the 
other moved out. Then they were coordinated, plundering my little 
body in unison. And I kept cumming and cumming, uncontrollably, 
sobbing and whimpering.
     Then Vern started shaking. "I'm gonna cum, buddy!" he gasped.
     "Both -- cum -- in me -- " I choked out between spasms.
     That did it for Ike, too. Both of them began pumping in short 
little strokes, violent strokes, pounding their swelling, twitching 
dicks into me as far as they'd go, which seemed pretty damn far. 
Then Vern -- and then Ike -- hunched against me. I could feel two 
sets of balls against my thighs, two pubic mats against me, and 
then, two cocks jerking and throbbing and flooding me. I felt 
Vern's juices flooding my bowels and I felt Ike's cock swelling in 
my cunt and knew he was spurting in there and all the orgasms and 
horniness rolled up inside me and let go at once. I locked up, 
frozen, between and around them and came harder and harder and 
harder, a single orgasm that just kept getting more intense. With 
my cum-drenched little body sandwiched between the two big sixteen-
year-olds, I just kept cumming until, finally, everything was one 
big orgasm and I knew nothing but orgasm and then I knew nothing, 
'cause I finally passed out -- cold.
     When I came to, I was a sandwich again, but no one was inside 
me and I felt firm, lush breasts against my back. Reenie whispered, 
"Are you okay, sweety?"
     I nodded against Ike's shoulder. I couldn't do much more than 
that at the moment. Vern put one of the sheets over us, against the 
cooling night air. My pussy still throbbed, but my butt was numb.
     "Some of us have tried doing that," she said. "Ellen liked it 
a lot. But I've never seen anyone cum like that, not that way." She 
shivered. Her nipples were stiff against my bare back. I wriggled 
against her. She had one hand on my belly. Ike kissed my ear. I 
felt utterly content for the first time. Thoroughly fucked, 
thoroughly sated and now, loved and hugged and valued and caressed 
and cuddled.
     Ike and Reenie and Vern and Ellen helped me get myself cleaned 
up and put together. We sat around and rested. Reenie and Ellen got 
me back to the house around midnight. Everyone else in the house 
was asleep, which was fine by me.
     That was the first time I'd pulled a train and it was the last 
for quite a while. During the rest of the two weeks, I got into 
some more group scenes, once with Helene and Reenie -- as nice as 
it was, I missed cocks -- and once with Ike and Reenie, at Reenie's 
house when the rest of her family was on a shopping expedition on 
the mainland. That was really nice. I think my favorite thing was 
laying on top of Reenie, licking her sweet, luxurious cunt while 
she sucked and nibbled my almost-hairless little slit -- and Ike 
sawed his hard dong slowly in and out. I came constantly, but it 
was wonderfully gentle waves of ecstasy and left me revived rather 
than enervated. Give me a couple -- male and female -- any time.
     Bobby and I got it on alone once, and after I'd sucked him off 
twice, I asked if he ever wanted to just plain ol' fuck. He said, 
Sure, but he wasn't sure about my being able to take his thick 
dick. Well, with patience and perseverance, I did, he did and it 
was fine -- but I was sore for two days, inside and out.
     When we got on the ferry back to Port Clinton, Mom and Dad 
said they were glad I'd made some friends so I wasn't bored. Even 
then I recognized the pun. Alexis cried and Jeanne was silent and 
the boys were cranky and I was just, well, contented. The islanders 
and I wrote occasionally, but island kids tend to leave as soon as 
they can; there's little future there. In later years I encountered 
a few of them. Ellen became a Moonie after Vern was killed in 'Nam 
and Reenie had joined a commune somewhere in Vermont. Ike was 
killed by a drunk driver on the Ohio Turnpike, near Elyria. Most of 
the others vanished from my life, but left me with an absolutely 
lovely set of memories.
     I did get another shot at Roger that summer and tried to 
buttfuck him -- it was near his birthday -- but he stopped before 
half his fat prickhead was in me. "I want to get in your butt, 
baby," he said, "but not when it'll put hurtin' on you." We found 
some enjoyable alternatives.
     That was over Labor Day Weekend. Then my eighth and last year 
in the prison school started. That was the year Ed Sautter started 
the photography club at the high school and I became a star.
