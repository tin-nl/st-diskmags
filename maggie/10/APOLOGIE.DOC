     I bet you would like to know who is apologizing for what !! 
Well, it's me, the lazy git, Michael Schuessler. I bet you have 
realized that my address has disappeared from the Addresses in 
Maggie ! The reason for this is that I have become even lazier 
than I used to be. In fact I am busier doing other things. 
Anyway, I want to apologize for not replying to the many letters 
I have received at my German address. It's not that I have not 
received them, it is just that I have not got the time to answer 
them all. I do read all of them with great interest, and try to 
remember all the improvements and suggestions you send me.

     Apart from that I have been busy coding a program called 
Universal Databse. It is basically a Program to administrate 
record collections, addresses and whatever else. the program has 
many different functions. It is nearly ready to be sold as a 
commercial product. As I am very short of cash I am also working 
on this program non stop.
