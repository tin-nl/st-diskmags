
 BIRD MAD GIRL SHOW

by The Fraggles


„Review by New Mode and Slime on 2nd of July 1992


Another French demo. Well, what can we expect now after such 
boring demos like the „NTM-Demo? Not much.

First of all we have to say that the DMA loader of this demo is 
extreme bullshit, since we've tried the demo on four STs (two 
German, one American and one Finnish) and we just got it to work 
on New Mode's ST. Give the coder responsible a big slap in the 
face if you meet him, this loader sucks (well again, at least no 
70hz shit in it, that's positive).

 Intro:

A bouncing picture telling you the strange name of this demo. 
Nothing more. Negative : you can't exit the intro when you want 
to, you have to wait until the picture disappeared.

‚Rating : 2


 Menu:

This menu was done by members of Legacy. Music is by Jess of the 
Overlanders. The menu itself features a brilliant textdisplayer 
and fast 3D graphics. At least a refreshing change from all these 
boring game menues.

‚Rating : 8.5


 Loader:

Same as the menu.
Loading routines suck, that's why we subtract 4 points.

‚Rating : 4.5


 Let's g et happy  / Fragg les:
‚
This is a fullscreen (at least half a fullscreen). A colourdister 
with different waveforms. Average graphics and a small scroller. 
Not too boring.

‚Rating : 5


 Doing  the Unstuck / Prism:

Technically this is the best screen in the demo. Nevertheless 
it's still boring. It's a fullscreen that displays and 
syncscrolls two spectrum pictures. It's playing a tracker music 
by Kefrens and has an apalling one plane logo. One of the 
spectrum pictures seems to be modern art (we say it's pixel 
garbage).
‚
In their scroller they state some stuff about us not including 
this screen into „Punish Your Machine. Well, we had two reasons. 
First one was that this screen didn't work on New Mode's ST and 
the other was that Pendragons were already dead at this time.

‚Rating : 6.5


 Out of Mind / The Fragg les:

This one is boring. Although technically ok, this screen is so 
unspectacular to watch. The music which was done by Jess of 
Overlanders is really good. There are zillions of small vertical 
scrollers and a disting background pattern. It's a fullscreen 
anyway.

‚Rating : 4.5


 Curiosity  / Polterg eist:

"Our last screen" they say. We hope they don't lie!

Trackermusic, one moving logo and two vertical scroller... Yawn!

 Apart (Preview) / The Fragg les:

This is a preview of a real screen. We don't understand where's 
the sense in putting a preview into a demo. Either finish your 
screens or don't include them.

There are several vectorballs objects (not very original). They 
are transforming from time to time.

„‚Rating : 3.5


 The Caterp illar / Veg etables:

First time in demo history, a screen is included in two demos.
See NTM review for more information.

‚Rating : 7


 Untitled / The Fragg les:

Swinging logo, Lap music, jerking small 3D cubes, charset by Spaz 
and a watereffect. Naah.

‚Rating : 3.5


 Lovesong  / MCODER:

This is the biggest collection of soundchip music. It features 
257 songs/soundeffects that are included into a suitable menu. 
A new style of vu-metres can be seen in the scroller. The 
amplitudes of the 4bit sinescroller change with the different 
channels. A lot of stuff like "Random Play" is available. Not 
spectacular, but if you want a music collection, this is the best 
for you.

‚Rating : 7


 Resetdemo:

Iron Maiden picture and a border scroller with incredible 
slaggings (they even give phone numbers of people they don't 
like, we think this is one of the worst events in demo history).

‚Rating : 2


Overall, first we have to tell you some negative things :

- DMA loader is shit
- Menu isn't kept in memory, each screen executes a reset and 
  both the intro and menu have to be reloaded.
