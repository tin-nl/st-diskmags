- The intro -
When you boot from the disk, a yellow ear appears which was 
taken from the cover of Jarre's CD 'Waiting for Cousteau'. When 
the data is decrunched, a very high quality protracker module 
starts to play. On the ST it is 16 KHz, on the STe it is 50 
KHz!!! The module was ripped from the demo 'Enigma' of 
Phenomena.

- The main demo -
When the credits are shown, a screen appears with four coloured 
rasterbars VU-meters in it and a bubble which flys over the 
scren dropping characters for a text. After some time, the four 
bars go spinning and bouncing on the screen.

- The musicselector -
When you press the spacebar you get a list of the modules which 
can be played in this demo. These modules are:

Act of Impulse by Tip & Mantronix of Phenomena
Chinese Dream  "   "        "     "      "
Elysium        by Jester of Sanity
Enigma         by Tip & Firefox of Phenomena
Just Spank It  by Tip & Mantronix of Phenomena
Macrocosm      "   "        "     "      "
Overload       "   "        "     "      "
The Sweat Shop "   "        "     "      "

By pressing return you can choose them.

The modules are not a normal format. They are Noisepacked. This 
programme is coded by Twins of Phenomena on the Amiga. The 
packer clears the name of the module, the name of the samples 
and some other things so that it can't be ripped so easy. The 
packer also optimizes the replay routine.

- The reset screen -
This is just a picture of a postcard with the address of Aura. 
If you reset again, the postcard will disappear and not as in so 
many demo's that you can't reset so you have to turn it off and 
on again.

- Overall -
This demo is a very good product from Aura who made also the 
Symic demo when they were Axxis. The coding is very easy but the 
routine is perfectly converted. The graphics are not extremely 
good but also not extremely bad and the music is fantastic 
ofcourse. It's different from all the other ST demo's and it's 
just 1 disk. It's compatible with the 520ST.

Coding:           77%
Graphics:         70%
Music:            98%
Worth having:     100% (It's a demo everybody must have like the 
                       Union demo)
Overall:          92%
