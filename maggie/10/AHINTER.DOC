
INTERVIEW WITH ARMIN HERZLINGER, A "REAL" CODER



MAGGIE: Before we start with this interview, please give us some 
brief information about yourself.

AH: I am 23 years old and student of computer science at the 
University of Kaiserslautern. I went into computers starting in 
1980 with programmable pocket calculators and the Commodore PET 
computers at school. Afterwards I owned ZX81, C64, C128 and 1985 
I got my first Atari ST.


MAGGIE: What kind of commercial programmes have you done so far?

AH: I wrote several programs for small companies (like 
databases), did some coding of a revision control system for IBM 
on a IBM3090 and wrote some small parts of Calamus SL. My latest 
commercial program is V-RAM, a virtual memory manager running on 
TT and compatible machines.


MAGGIE: For which company are you working?

AH: I have my own company, but due to lack of time I let my 
products distribute by other companies (like Overscan 
distributing V-RAM).


MAGGIE: What equipment do you use for the development of your 
programmes?

AH: I use an Atari TT030/12 with 21" screen and 0.5 GByte 
harddrive.


MAGGIE: And what kind of software?

AH: I am a dedicated C programmer. I use Pure C, gcc and Pure 
Assembler for assembly routines.


MAGGIE: Have you ever had contact with the demo coders' scene?

AH: Yes, I have. Starting at my C64 times up to now. Nowadays I 
mainly have contact to members of Delta Force (ED: Obviously, 
eh?)


MAGGIE: What do you think about demos? Are they any good or just 
a waste of time?

AH: There is a big potential in demos and they take a huge 
amount of time to write. Nevertheless I do not think that they 
are a waste of time, because most demo coders code for fun, so 
why not? And in the past many good games for Atari computers 
where written by formar demo coders.


MAGGIE: Is there still a future for Atari?

AH: I think there is. Atari slept for years, but they woke up 
and there are many wonderful things to come. But Atari has to 
start nearly from the scratch in many countries. They have to 
build up a new net of Atari dealers, do [more] advertising and 
bring their computers into the public.


MAGGIE: What's your favourite computer?

AH: I like my TT a lot, it does all the things I want it to do 
and at least here in Germany there is great software around and 
forthcoming.


MAGGIE: Is there friendship in the "real" programmers scene? Or 
is it just pure competition?

AH: Oh yes, there is ! Thats one thing I like with having an 
Atari: It's not that commercialized like e.g. the Clone scene. I 
have good contacts to other developers and there truly is 
friendship among most of us.


MAGGIE: Are you playing games sometimes, and if yes what's your 
favourite?

AH: Playing games I like a lot. Especially adventure games like 
The Pawn, Fish, Monkey Island etc. I like good jump and run 
games too, but there are only few of them running on a TT ;-(


MAGGIE: Any other hobbies apart from computing?

AH: Sure, I like swimming, collecting gems and minerals, reading 
(SF&F I like most).


MAGGIE: A lot of demos don't work on TT, can you give any 
suggestions how to do "clean" coding?

AH:

a)
A very common problem is the inproper use of the sync-mode    
register. Many  games and demos alter the syncronisation bit and    
this causes the TT to crash  in most cases. So do not alter this    
bit at all (it has a different meaning on the TT anyway).

b)
The stack format of the 68030 is different to the one on the 
68000. Demos/games hanging in trap or interupt vectors have to 
check wether they are started on a non-68000 machine and if so 
there is one more word on the stack (identifying the type of 
stackframe and vector offset). This can be done by checking 
_longframe ($59e), if it is not equal 0, the machine has long 
stackframes.

c)
Everything relying on the timing of instructions of the 68000 
will crash. Thats a hard one because many effects are based on 
this.


MAGGIE: Will you ever code a demo?

AH: In the past I wrote some small routines like e.g. very fast 
vector object routines using the TT video sample&hold mode, but 
I suppose I will never have the time to do a whole demo.


MAGGIE: What's your opinion about the Falcon 30. Are the rumours 
true or are they just wishful-thinking?

AH: I do not know what rumours you have heard, but some of the 
ones I heard are not this wrong .-) But I am impressed about 
what the machine can do and the prize of Falcon 030.


MAGGIE: Will you be working on Falcon 30?

AH: I am already working on Falcon 030 :-)


MAGGIE: Is this machine a real competition for MessyDOS 
calculators?

AH: I do not think that the Falcon 030 will be a real 
competition to 386/486, because it is a machine for a different 
market. Falcon 030 is designed to be a 'consumer' maschine, like 
video recorders, cd players and game consoles. But it unites 
features of all these and ties them together. Thats what I think 
'multimedia' really is! Multimedia with powerfull expensive 
workstations might be great, but only few can use it. With 
Falcon 030 nearly everybody can do things like own videos with 
titling and cool effects, or even make his own rap sound track, 
watch TV in a window while writing and sending E-Mail with a 
software modem and much more. For the semiprofesional and 
profesional market Atari surely will bring machines of the 
Falcon-line too.


MAGGIE: Why are so many "real" programmers pretty arrogant 
towards demo coders?

AH: Perhaps because they miss so many great demos that will not 
run on their machines ? .-)
Some people complain about the 'dirty' tricks demo coders use, 
but there are at least as many 'real' programmers doing 
undocumented things and thats worse, if people who bought their 
software can not use it. Demos are created out of fun and out of 
the ambition to push the impossible one step farther and shared 
with others so they can take part in the fun.


MAGGIE: Do you think CISC technology still has a future?

AH: Nowadays the gap between CISC and RISC is closing. Modern 
CISC machines are capable of doing more than one instruction per 
clock cycle and RISC machines are getting more and more complex. 
I think in the future you can not destinguish between RISC and 
CISC; processors like the 68040 unite already both technologies 
and this will go even farther in future.


MAGGIE: Have you seen the new multitasking TOS? Is it any good?

AH: I like it very much. It is easy to use and, especially 
compared to other multitasking systems, very small and fast. 
Because MultiTOS is based on MiNT, MultiTOS gives you many great 
features from Unix with staying very user friendly. There are 
still things that could be improved in future releases but 
overall it is quite usefull and gives your computer a lot of new 
power. With MultiTOS Atari really has not to hide compared to 
e.g. OS/2 and System 7.


MAGGIE: Now you have space for your own stuff like greetings, 
etc...

AH: I want to greet all members of Delta Force and all people 
who helped to wake up Atari with spending many unpaid hours in 
doing the work that normally had to be done by Atari.
Special thanks to New Mode, Robo, Knut, Andi, Marco and Sara.


MAGGIE: Thanks for this interview!
