„"Gee whiz, another pair of shoes..... You shouldn't have....
„ No really..!!!" - Imelda Marcos....

          „The Inner Circuit Explorers „proudly present:-

          T H E   ICE   C O L L E C T I O N   (STE!!)
       (())(())(())(())(())(())(())(())(())(())(())(())

Yup diddly!! Some more of those rare things called 'STE Demos'..

„Background... I.C.E., or Inner Circuit Explorers to their friends 
are a Swedish crew who, unknown to most of us, have been coding 
screens for the STE for the past year!! You can't keep a good 
Swede down, as they say, and certainly, none of us would care to 
try....

The demo itself consists of six screens on one disk, headed by a 
simple menu detailing which key to hit ('F1 to 'F6..) a small 
scrolltext, and a module playing at a reasonably high khz rate..

F1. Enchanted Demo. The earliest of them all (They are in 
chronological order, 'F6' 'Jam Colours' is a 1992 effort..)

A multi-part jobbie, starts with a bouncing huge 'ICE' logo, which 
works in a manner reminiscent of the Mindbomb intro (Not the 
punching Carebear bit...) A chain of bouncing balls in the bottom 
border, some scrolltext (I wish I could make sense of my notes on 
this demo..) And a looping sample... Second part of this demo 
features a mirrored reflective scrolltext, with the lower border 
fully occupied with this. Also some indicator bars for the 
soundchip music (!?) Some large text whizzing back and forth 
across the screen, a central chessboard pattern field in many 
shades rushing towards the screen, and a top border info (How to 
contact ICE) scroller.. Truly a many diverse elements screen..

(Don't go Away!) The reset demo, some lower border raster-type 
indicator bars for the other (Probably Mad Max) soundchip music...

F2. Digital World. Starts with some rotating 'ICE' sprites, which 
shimmer as they go (Colour cycling?) to the background of a 
drumbeat. A large Atari 'Mount Fuji' logo appears, then several 
horizontal scrolltexts and some more bouncing 'ICE' Logos..

The second part of this screen has several balls or bobs spill 
from both top corners of the screen, and bounce and collect at the 
bottom, where they are sucked out of existence, a more interesting 
looping sample plays, there is also a scroller with a reflective 
'watery' layer in the bottom border, and some raster effects..

F3. Digital World II. An interesting screen, begins with a 
Raytraced piccy (Sorry only 16 shades?? all blue..) Apparently 
converted from PC „Gif format... and with a very strange sample 
playing...

This is only a taster for the main screen, which have a distorting 
'ICE logo (They like the name or something..) Some large text 
which tell you this is the 'Digital World II' screen, some lower 
border text scrolling „through a rotating transparent globe, very 
much like the old style BBC (British Broadcasting Corp..) one that 
they used to have on the telly... Also some sineous 'splashy' drum 
indicators (Look at the TCB Tracker indicators to get a better 
idea..) The music is a module, quite a good Jean Michel Jarre-ish 
job in stereo, at 12.5khz..

F4. The Intruder. Top border 'ICE' thing, lower border text in a 
slightly oriental font. In the middle a dead starfield (Who killed 
it??) with four indicator bars for the digi music module playing 
away.. At the top, a small window for scrolling things and a bar 
subject to raster-type effects.. (What a keen memory, you can 
tell, can't you??)

F5. Hard as ICE. This is a natural for the 'Cunning Demos' as it 
consists of two parts, firstly, several minutes of vector lined 
cubes, parallelograms, and other objects which twirl, twist, are 
technically impressive, but fail to excite... Then those who wait 
are rewarded with a very, very nice screen indeed..

This have.. Huge Dragon head sprite which go all over the screen

         .. And this is fullscreen (Nil borders..)

         .. …Five voice soundtracker at 15.6 khz (No stereo!!)

         .. Tiny top border text..

         .. large upper border text and rastered indicator bars.
         
         .. Text distorts all over the place..
         
         .. A small controllable sprite which follow the big one..

This is an „Excellent Adventure of a screen.. One of the best 
screens yet on an STE...

F6. Jam Colours. The last of this disk, and probably the most 
accomplished of them all, Starts with starfield, then moves very 
swiftly into a Fullscreen, absolutely no trace of border, plasma 
screen, probably the best plasma outside of the Overlanders.. 

Also some text which draws itself on and off, then the plasma goes 
away and a fullscreen horizontal text scroller appears.. This is 
strangely coloured, and plasma and other wavey effects gradually 
appear within the scroller.. There are some effects that are 
rarely seen on the ST if you wait a while to see them.. A looping 
sample plays.. This being a string/synth based melody, and is 
quite appropriate for the screen..

This concludes the main bit of the review..

„Ratingsssssss.....

…Graphixx:- 74% - Most of the earlier screens were fairly ordinary 
in graphical content, but this collection really lifted with 
screens five and six, expect some very good stuff in the future 
from them..

…Sonixx:- 81% - The whole range of ST music on here, soundchip 
stuff fortunately not too much in evidence.. Combination of looped 
Samples (Works well but repetitive after a while..) and full-blown 
Modules (Cannot recall if they were original or ripped, still, 
they were good tunes, especially screen five..)
…
Gee Whizz:- 83% - Early screens not much new to offer, but 
attempts to push the STE from screen five onwards.. Very nice 
fullscreen plasma for the last demo....

…Overall:- 79% - A good early effort, also an interesting look at 
how a crew can progress over the space of a year, (Compare the 
first and last screens to see what I mean...)

„The last word.. We have not heard the last of these, as I also 
received a couple of preview screens for the Mega Leif (Electra 
convention) demo competition... Watch this space.... (And your 
eyes go funny...)
