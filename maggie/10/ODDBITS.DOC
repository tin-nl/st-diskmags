…            And „ …Whatever......
„By CIH 
„
Atari, their loves, lives, and hopes..
The Falcon!!!„ (Or whatever it will be called?!?!?!?!)

After a lot of speculation (Started here, you read the story of 
the 'STEE' here first!!) we are now getting some idea about the 
new 32 Bit machine, on which the corporate fortunes of Atari will 
rest for the next few years, barring the launch of such things as 
the 'Jaguar' giga-console (Which seems to have gone remarkably 
quiet lately..) The Falcon was previewed (Sort of, not 
intentionally to people like journalists..) at Dusseldorf in 
March, at a closed-door developers meeting, some facts did emerge, 
and various postulated tech-specs are circulating the rumour mill.
„
Here is a round up of the best ones..„

CPU:- Motorola 16mhz 68030 very likely, rising to 32mhz, and 40mhz 
68040 in some accounts, if the intention is to keep prices 
reasonable, the baseline spec probably will only go to 16mhz..
„
Sound:- The best documented bit so far, the soundchip is a 
Motorola 56001 DSP (Digital Signal processor), the same chip as 
used in the NEXT Station, capable of ten channels, at 32 to 50khz 
(16 Bit quality?) The chip has several useful secondary 
applications such as file compression, and is a piece of silicon 
to be reckoned with.. As far removed from the despised YM2149, as 
a Sopwith Camel is from an F16!! One account has it going full 
blast on all ten channels with only „2% of CPU time needed...
„
Graphics:- In complete contrast, the most nebulous area, 
speculated 256 or 512 colours onscreen, choosing from an enhanced 
palette of anything from 32768 (the same as Super Nintendo) to 1.6 
million colours, in a resolution of 640 * 480, plus all existing 
STE and TT modes, the Custom hardware for graphics can apparently 
handle 128  64*64 pixel sprites (Again, the same as Super 
Nintendo...) And if the custom hardware for the defunct Panther 
console is anything to go by, will feature such things as 3-D 
polygon generation.. This part of the hardware is rumoured to be 
based on Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) technology, and is 
„extremely fast...„

Hardware, and related miscellany:- Ok, a 1.44MB high density 
floppy as standard, (Sensible..) possible maths co-processor, 
sampling hardware built in (As part of the DSP?) "Scuzzy" port for 
hard drive connection (No more expensive HD controllers..) 
Connection for Super VGA monitor, 'Smalltalk' network port, and 
provision for Genlock, possibility of internally mounted hard 
drive as additional feature, anything up to 14Mb RAM (Start at 1 
or 2MB..) Something „very special for MIDI (Something like 80 
channels!!) Multi-TOS to be implemented..
„
The Wild and Wacky zone... An internal slot for a 386SX CPU, for 
direct PC emulation, also 32-bit True colour, the ability to run 
the NeXT Step O/S (Not likely on a œ500.00 machine, but possible 
for a top of the range 68040 model??)
„
That All-Important price!! Probably pegged at around the œ5-600 
mark (UK Price, some other currency prices are closer to œ500!!) 
As it is intended to 'Kick Amiga Butt..' (Somebody in Atari's 
words..)
„
Release date:- God knows, it depends which branch of Atari you 
talk to, optimists are hopeful for late Autumn this year.. The 
machine is in the hands of developers, including some fairly 
famous people, as you read this.. We will know more at either the 
big CES show in June in the US, or at the Hannover Messe in 
August, by which time, further speculation will seem quaint..
„
All the above compiled from all the information I was able to lay 
my hands on, some is in print already, a lot was passed by word of 
mouth, and should be taken only as a good general guide of what to 
expect. In my view, if the Falcon is launched, say with the basic 
spec (Grafix/sound/CPU etc) intact, it will still be a very hard 
act to follow indeed, all of us here have our tongues out, 
drooling in anticipation... CIH..

A quick word on 'The Decline of the ST'..„

Fit the following:- The ST was launched in 1985, as "Power without 
the price." It is now 1992, which is, let me see....  …Seven Years 
Later!! A very long time for any computer, did anybody still have 
their Spectrum for that long??? Probably not, Any 'death' is 
entirely due to the natural process of ageing (Subject to any 
lethal injections given by software houses!!) No wonder the Falcon 
is so keenly awaited...
„
The leaks surrounding the Falcon seem to indicate a totally 
wonderful new machine, which is not like the Atari we are all used 
to (The „Bunion that we all endure..) which may suggest one of two 
things, either, they will do a 'Panther' and not release it at 
all, or attempt the now famous "Last minute lack of Haporth of tar 
to spoil the ship," imagine a membrane keyboard salvaged from the 
old Atari 400 series, or a built in microdrive borrowed from 
Sinclair Research, or totally non-standard ports for non-existent 
peripherals, or even two colours onscreen, out of 1.6 million.. Of 
course, we could all simultaneously wake up to discover it was all 
a dream..
„
Some other computer chat...

It has come to my attention that there is at least one other major 
company with a marketing policy as perverse as Atari's, that 
"other" company is of course Commodore („Cries of "Where have you 
been for the last 600 years etc...) „

Where is the proof? Well, following hot on the heels of the 
'success' of the Amiga Plus, now comes the Amiga A600, an Amiga 
motherboard squashed and cut to fit inside something like a 
Spectrum Plus case (Said motherboard rumoured to come from inside 
the CDTV...)

It comes in two flavours, bog-standard, and extra flaky chocolate 
bits, with a 20Meg internal hard drive.. In addition to the 'Plus 
incompatabilities, the keypad on the right hand side has been 
deleted, making certain programs like MIG29 Fulcrum unplayable 
(Not the sort of case to have people leaping off the Eiffel Tower, 
I agree, but it is difficult to see how this can be an attractive 
purchase if most flight-sims become instantly unplayable..)

Indeed, it is not too hard to forsee a situation, where second 
hand Amigas with 'Old' ROMs and workbench are seen as more 
valuable and precious than the new machines, The A600 truly 
represents a developmental cul-de-sac for the Amiga, and from my 
rather instant On-the-spot research at the local computer store, 
appears to be despised there..

„(With one exception, a rather strange and serious matter;-  It has 
come to my notice, that the Honorary Life President of the Amiga-
haters Society, Nathan Gould OBE (Ol Big 'Ead) „actually has one of 
these beasties in his bedroom, And worse still, …IT IS THERE TO 
STAY!!!„ He says that the ST is still the major 'Serious' machine, 
but we all know about starting on the slippery slope, etc.. Any 
suitable punishment suggestions, please write in to the address 
given..)

I have now heard he has got rid of it, good job!!!

On the 'Plus/A600 front, the level of incompatibility is at least 
as great as for the early days of the STE, and have been reliably 
informed of the many last minute revisions needed to get „anything 
to work at all...

It has transpired, that the 'Plus is to discontinue production in 
favour of the A600!! The A600 is now the flagship of the low 
priced Amiga's. A very strange move indeed..

„The good news (Allegedly..) In high resolution mode, it only 
flickers a little bit now, and Workbench 2.0 is "Just about usable 
when installed on a hard drive.."

Other Amiga-related things, I got hold of some Amiga publications, 
it is the case that they are as concerned as the ST community 
about the impending 'death' of their machine as well, I also read 
an interesting and scathing article about the success, (Or 
otherwise) of CDTV (Maybe Commodore did go too far with a separate 
go it alone format???) We may have to look out for the Amiga 
A4000, or some other cheap 68020 or 68030 based machine (Sounds 
very familiar??) There are some mutterings from the development 
community to indicate that this does exist ("A rather Nice machine 
with a small footprint..") But unlike the Falcon, very little is 
known about it at the moment.. There is also some talk in the 
Amiga community of an enhanced chip set, 24-Bit colour, and 16 
channel sound, for example..

The A570 CD-ROM/CDTV drive out soon???

The Amiga bits over, some other well known makes...

„The PC:-  Is still as boring and overpriced (Business priced..) as 
ever. Americans seem to like these, and the badly written programs 
that depend on a 32-bit processor and flashy S-VGA graphics, and 
expensive optional soundcards to make them work.. A lot of the 
media are easily taken in by them too, and seem too keen to write 
off the 16bit machines (ST and Amiga) prematurely. Most PC buyers 
in Europe and the UK are still corporate users, or rare rich 
kids.. They are popular in the USA, where hardware prices are 
lower, and also „Per Capita incomes are much higher than here, a 
little fact that most PC enthusiasts seem to overlook somehow..
„(You can tell I don't like PC's too much, this is a deliberate 
antidote to the manic PC worshipping elsewhere in this issue of 
Maggie..) „

Anyway, know any great demos written on the PC? Who are the great 
and zany personalities of the PC scene!?!??!

…Coming soon, an Earthshattering new concept in machine demos, the 
first PC demo, the megamighty "Bald bloke in a Suit Demo" 
written by Anders "A.N. Managing Director" Koooool.. With no 
sound, and lots of company logo's sluggishly tracing across the 
screen, 'cos its written in 'C', or something... … „(See separate 
review in the demo section...)

„Super Nintendo (Mutant turtle..):- The Super Famicon, some tasty 
hardware entombed inside an old Tandy Colour Computer casing has 
just been launched, some time ahead of previous estimates for the 
UK, where a date much later in the year, or even next year was 
forecast.. It is not exactly new hardware any more, but the sort 
of people who get excited by baseball caps worn back to front love 
it to bits... (Yo dude!!) 

„Neo-Geo The Arcade in the home, I don't bloody well think so, 
unless your home has got umpteen millions of crisp fragments 
crushed into the carpet, which is a ghastly tasteless orange 
colour anyway, and there is no lighting apart from 50 million 
flickering fluorescent screens, and you have got seven hundred 
adolescent Mutant Ninja maniac street children staring over your 
shoulder at the screen waiting for their turn.. Not forgetting 
there is always some wrinkled old prune in a glass booth where 
your TV ought to be. And several poorly paid members of the 
Institute of Lesbian bouncers laughingly described as "Employees" 
swinging bags of change furiously in your direction..

No Siree!! There is a long way to go before you can get an 'Arcade 
in the home.' (A brain operation for a start...) Anyway, if the 
first part of the article is true, you could probably have change 
from a Falcon, for the price of one of these..
„
Sega Gigadrive Genesis CD-Rom with built in Ex-Soviet State 
Nuclear Industry RMBK Reactor like the one they had at Chernobyl..
Unsurprisingly, not a lot has been heard of this recently...

„ZX (Amstrad) Spectrum:- Have they actually stopped production of 
this yet??? 

„Amstrad CPC series:- Same query as above, Amstrad seem to be going 
all-out on PC's and tying up deals with Intel, We wonder what 
happened to their other computers, the 'Enhanced' CPC's certainly 
did not catch on..
„
This is a weird subject, the tendency is for particular models to 
slowly fade out of sight, the last time I remember a machine being 
formally 'killed' apart from reasons such as bankruptcy, was the 
end of production of the Vic 20!! When was the "Stop" date of the 
'old Atari XL series????? They are not seen anymore, so somebody, 
somewhere must have pulled the plug...

„I am sort of trying to keep an eye on the all-important European 
Cup match whilst writing this article, they have virtually just 
begun, and England are one-nil up against Sweden already!!!! 
England need to win this match to go on to the semi finals (This 
is their first goal of the whole tournament, normally, nil-nil 
draws are sufficient for them for some reason... CIH....)

The Swedes have now gotta goal back, it is all in the balance!!

England will be lucky not to concede anymore, well it just remains 
for the supporters to go and torch Stockholm (Probably..)

Well they have (Dropped another goal, that is..) It was a good one 
by Sweden too... Sweden are really playing on a high at the 
moment, and England are playing like they are totally outclassed..

And so they have won (And Denmark have done the same to France..)

That's all for now folks, if the Falcon (Or whatever it is really 
called!!) is revealed before this next issue, it will get it's own 
special article, and you may like to have a good laugh at the bulk 
of this one... „CIH (C) 17th June 1992....
