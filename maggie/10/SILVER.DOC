
 SILVER DREAM MACHINE

Whatever happened to traditional British reserve? So asks David 
Long, after witnessing the Tokyo launch of the world's fastest 
production car.


Is it possible, in this day and age, to justify a road-going motor 
car which costs more than œ400,000, can accelerate from 0-60 in less 
than four seconds, 0-100 in less than eight, and manage more than 
200mph on the straight?
Probably not, but who cares? Such cars, after all, are for 
enthusiasts, and questions like these for mere philosophers. No, 
what matters here is that the cause of all the fuss - and what a 
fuss - is British.
The intercontinental ballistic automobile in question is, of course, 
the new Jaguar - the XJ220 - which was recently clocked at 213.3mph, 
thereby making it the fastest production car on the planet. Needless 
to say, it's caused a storm amongst the Greens, the Means and the 
2CV-driving classes ‚(ED: Slime drives 2CV too, but nevertheless he 
likes the XJ220!) but, to be honest, I can't see what their problem 
is. For one thing, it runs unleaded, and for another, the pricetag 
is actually pretty reasonable when you park it next to your average 
streetlegal Group C Porsche conversion, or indeed Jaguar's own XJR-
15, which costs half a million quid and doesn't even have electric 
windows. OK, so 200mph is perhaps a bit steep for everyday use, but 
on balance the whole thing sounds bloody marvellous to me, and I 
suspect the wingers are simply jealous because they can't afford 
one. ‚(ED: Can you Mr. Long?)
Its story apparently started with a sketch done seven years ago on a 
table napkin by one Jim Randle. Lucky Jim is Jaguar's engineering 
director, and his concept was transformed into 3D by stylists Geoff 
Lawson and Keith Helfert, and exhibited on the Jaguar stand at the 
1988 Birmingham Motor Show. It stole the show, of course, doubtless 
in part because it was accompanied by a broad hint from the company 
that they might build 220 of them (or 350 if the demand was there) 
and offer them for sale.
In the event, and in spite of a whopping 50 grand deposit, and an 
index-linked final price, more than 1500 applications were received 
within a day or two, and the first car will be delivered to its very 
lucky owner this spring.
This is, after all, the first time in decades that Britain has 
produced a road car able to beat the best. For many years the 
'World's Fastest' title has leapt back and forth from one Italian 
„marque to another - most recently from a 201mph Ferrari to a 202mph 
Lamborghini - but this time Jaguar has taken the crown and done so 
with a decent margin. And good luck to them. They may not have won 
Le Mans this year, but they are still the World Sports Car 
Champions, so you can't blame them for wanting to show off a bit.
The company is also said to be considering fielding a Formula One 
team but, for the time being, all eyes are on this one. From any 
angle the XJ220 looks very much like a Jaguar, bristling with design 
elements borrowed not only from the current track cars but also from 
the earlier and ill-fated Jaguar XJ13 project.
Huge, and hugely charismatic, it has great presence both on and off 
the road, its dramatically attractive styling proving every bit as 
stunning as was the E-Type 30 years ago. And, like the E-Type, it 
combines those stunning looks with an incredibly high level of both 
performance and comfort. These days there are, after all, many 
supercars which approach the 200mph mark - I can think of a dozen, 
at least one of which (Ferrari's F40) will pull 95mph in first - but 
few, if any, boast the interior comforts of this one. With gimmick-
free analogue instrumentation, leather upholstery, door casings and 
fascia, electric windows, central locking, air-conditioning and a 
fully-featured state-of-the-art Alpine CD sound system, it is, in 
this department, very much the traditional Jaguar.
But, of course, no one's buying this car for the hi-fi, and my bet 
is that most drivers will spend more time listening to the 
blistering sound of its glorious engine than to the dubious delights 
of Mahler or Madonna.
Yet it is this which is perhaps the biggest surprise the car has to 
offer. Unlike the '88 showcar, it hasn't got a V12, nor even a V8, 
instead the XJ220 boasts just six cylinders - and in a 'vee' 
formation too, a highly unusual choice for Jaguar.
When Ferrari abandoned its V12 tradition many a complaint was heard, 
though not, it must be said, from those who'd actually driven the 
engines which replaced the V12. Take comfort then if you're worried 
about Jaguar abandoning the 12, and don't forget their earlier six-
pot which, more than 30 years ago, managed more than 186mph and took 
the D-Type to no fewer than three Le Mans victories.
No disappointment whatsoever attends this new engine. It, too, has 
got a racing heritage on its side, having been developed for the 
Silk Cut XJR-11, it now powers the Bud Light Team Jaguars, which 
have already notched up half a dozen victories in the highly-
competitive American IMSA series. It's also got power, lots of it. 
Equipped with twin turbos, four valves per cylinder, four camshafts 
and a pair of 3-way catalytic converters, the all-alloy six 
displaces some 3.5 litres and put out an incredible 542bhp at 
7,000rpm and a massive 475lb/ft of torque at 4,500. This is 
transmitted through a five speed transaxle, designed by FF 
Developments as was the viscous-controlled limited slip 
differential. Tyres are undirectional Bridgestone Expedia S-01s, and 
braking is by enormous four caliper discs. Suspension, of course, 
follows conventional racing practice with unequal wishbones, inboard 
concentric coil springs and Bilstein dampers to give accurate and 
precise road-holding and phenomenally good handling throughout the 
car's enormous speed range. At the same time, the car's low speed 
ride remains acceptable, indeed the factory is confident that their 
200mph + missile will be more than able to deal with the normal 
slow, stop-start frustrations of modern around-town motoring. This 
is thanks in part to a particularly long and detailed prototype 
development programme, using two of Jaguar's own Le Mans-winners - 
Andy Wallace and John Nielsen - for ultra-high performance testing.
But much of the credit for the car's superb roadholding goes to the 
body-styling team. The dramatic styling of the XJ220 was intended 
not only to look fantastic, but also to manage the airflow over and 
under the car to optimise both conventional aerodynamcis and its 
essential 'ground effects' characteristics. As a result, whilst the 
front splitter and rear aerofoil force the car downwards, underbody 
venturi tunnels effectively suck the car down on the road surface. 
The combined effect, at 200mph, is an additional 600lbs of 
downforce, giving the car outstanding adhesion when cornering, and 
spectacular high speed handling throughout its performance curve.
The body's construction is just as impressive, and makes a huge 
contribution to the car's outstanding performance. Utilising 
advanced aerospace technology, the main 'tub' is constructed using a 
bonded aluminium honeycomb, which was developed for Jaguar by a 
company better known, perhaps, for kitchen foil than for high-
adrenalin machines like this. Alcan's Aluminium Structured Vehicle 
Technology (ASVT), creates a light but incredibly strong assembly 
which, pound for pound, is both stronger and stiffer than 
conventional bodywork. If you've ever wondered whether 'racing 
improves the breed', the XJ220's space-age construction is all the 
proof you need. That, and 213.3mph.
There's no doubt that this one will be a big winner for Jaguar. 
Indeed, the XJ220 was already a success, long before the two-a-week 
production line was officially opened by HRH The Princess of Wales 
in October. Whether or not she trades in her XJS for one is perhaps 
besides the point, because the XJ220 waiting list is already closed. 
Long before you read this, every car will have been allocated (one 
each to Elton John and Mick Jagger, or so it's rumoured) - but don't 
let that worry you. If you really want one that badly, low-mileage 
examples should be popping up by about June. Shall we start the 
bidding at half a million, gentlemen? Do I hear five-five?
