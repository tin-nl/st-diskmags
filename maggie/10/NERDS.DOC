
           Computer Nerdism And What To Do About It


You  all  probably have some kind of image,  what a Computer  Nerd 
looks like.  Maybe that image includes speech defects,  eyeglasses 
1"  thick,  inability to talk to women (hmm,  let's make that 'the 
opposite sex' even if there aren't any women reading this) and  so 
forth.          

But do YOU know whether or not YOU are a CompuNerd? If you are not 
sure,  take the following test.  Answer honestly!  Score one point 
for each 'yes' answer. The questions are in no particular order.

Have you ever...

- Missed a class because of using/abusing computer?
- Missed a day in school/work for the above reason?
- Coded all night long just to show yourself/your closest  friends 
that  you  can do something of no importance (like  plotting  1000 
points in a VBL?)
- Had more computers than girlfriends?
- Had more computers than friends?
- Felt that you are always in acute shortage of floppy disk / hard 
disk space / memory?
- Ruined  a  beautiful summer day by debugging  a  program,  even 
though you were not paid for it?
- Ruined  several beautiful summer days by debugging  a  program,
even though you were not paid for it?
- Been frustrated or angry as you could not debug a program  until 
you realized your error was a lacking ';' or somesuch?
- Bought a new computer / laser printer / monitor / other piece of 
computer gadgetry just because you could afford it?
- Bought a new computer / laser printer / monitor / other piece of 
computer gadgetry even if you couldn't afford it?
- Sat in front of a computer at midnight,  waiting for a download 
from the local BBS to be finished?
- Called in a BBS more often than your friends?
- Called nowhere but BBS's ?
- Got a mega-phonebill by calling BBS's abroad?
- Thought that using chat,  talk,  rmsg,  email, irc or similar is 
easier and more comfortable than a face-to-face contact?
- Paid  no  attention to the attractive member  of  opposite  sex 
sitting   right  next  to  you  because  your  program  was   more 
interesting?
- Made jokes which require knowledge of a programming language, an 
operating system or a program to understand?
- Told those jokes in a company that didn't understand them?
- Had  trouble  finding things to do because  your  computer  was 
broken?
- Tried to commit a suicide because your computer was broken  and 
you were so frustrated about it?
- Looked at X-rated GIFs as a replacement for sex?
- Looked at X-rated GIFs and masturbated as a replacement for sex?
- Felt that your life had ended when your hard disk crashed?
- Played computer games just to beat your/someone's high  score 
and become obsessed by it?

And  now,  let's  see...  Total the points and look at the results 
table:

0          You are not a CompuNerd
1-25       You ARE a CompuNerd
<0 or >25  Get lost, geek.

What will you do if you are a CompuNerd?  Get a life! Get friends, 
girl/boyfriend(s), learn a foreign language, travel, buy a parrot, 
go to movies, drink alcohol, smoke joints, run naked in the woods, 
rave,  damage  your  ears with loud music,  whatever,  BUT GET AWAY 
FROM THAT FUCKING COMPUTER! Computers are fun, but they are NOT, I 
repeat,  NOT  the  only thing in life.  So get your ass out of the 
chair and do something before you die of old age, damnit!
