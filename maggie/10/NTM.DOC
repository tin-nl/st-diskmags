Another French production coming on more than one disk - to be 
precise, it is a two-disk-demo. If it's worth the two disks you'll 
read right now.
As usual, we will review one screen after the other. If you don't 
agree with this style of review drop us a letter and tell us how to 
do it better.


 Intro:

This is an original one with completely ripped graphics from 'TOKI'. 
Some monkey is jumping around.
‚Rating: 4„


 Loader:

You'll now have to bear some jerking stars and chessboard pattern 
and a music that hurts the ears. The loading times are extremly long 
and they are not caused by long screens.
‚Rating: 0


 Menu:

'Yippie'! A 'Goldrunner'-like menu.... How we hate this! And, there 
is NO alternative menu - you have to fly around with your spacecraft 
to select the screens for ages. And you even have to shoot aliens to 
stay alive - after three wasted lives -> Adios muchachos (you have 
to start from the beginning!)
There's just a two-plane background and the music done by LAP is 
awful. The only positive thing is that you are able to stear your 
craft by cursor keys and joystick.
Before we forget, there is a cheat mode to get infinite energy. 
Choose the first screen by ZUUL and type in JACKPOT - and don't 
forget: It is a French demo (hint, hint)!

 TGE:

Oh well, this screen must be very old as TGE doesn't exist anymore 
since a long time now - and that's what it looks like..... a logo, a 
tube and a big scroller together with a hip-hop soundtrack which 
sucks!
‚Rating: 3


 Zuul:

Yeah! I never knew how much I missed it - the flashing drivelights 
give me the creeps!!!! A „FRENCH scrolltext - waaaaaaah! (Aren't you 
able to speak English?) An one-plane scroller, a disting logo ('how 
original'!) and some mountains with nice colours in the background 
completely wiped out by a ridiculous 'train' (?)!!
‚Rating: 2


 Next:

Disappointment! You see a system charset (!), vu-meter like the one 
in 'Level 16's screen in 'Syntax Terror'. Textured line-vectors and 
a scrolling background with a logo (two-plane). The not too bad 
music is done by LAP.
‚Rating: 3


 Futur(e) Minds:

The 'best' screen so far.... First there is some precalculation and 
then some flickering rasters, some real odd shapes, and fucking vu-
meters give me the creeeeeeps!!! Besides, in this screen is the 
worst sound we've heard since a long time! FUCK!
‚Rating: 0


 MJJ:

This screen features some unimportant options, a two-plane 
background, many little scrollers and a big eight-pixel-scroller!
‚Rating: 4


 Vegetables:

This is a two-parts screen. The first one includes some vertical 
rasters with a real nice logo. The second part is a colourdister 
with options that look not bad to us.
‚Rating: 7


 Fingerbobs:

This is one of the better screens like the one from 'Vegetables'. A 
lot of little small scrollers (oh no), good music by Count Zero, a 
very strange but still fairly ok logo and two two-plane scrollers 
with a bizarre scrolltext. It's ok.
‚Rating: 6


 SCA:
 
Another fullscreen here. The whole screen is scrolling, but it's 
just one plane and the graphics look like memory garbage. The 
scroller is French and it's just 8 scanlines high. So forget it, 
even the music is booooring.
‚Rating: 0


 Hiddenscreen: (find yourself)

We really wonder why ZUUL have hidden it. Big scroller in two 
planes, a disting logo, one plane sprite. Much better than it 
sounds, at least better than ZUUL's first screen that is NOT hidden.
‚Rating: 4


 ACF:

Nice graphics, good colours, disting/swinging logos and sinus dots. 
It's the best screen so far, but still somehow boring. Compared to 
the rest it's mindblasting.
‚Rating: 7


 Dynamic Duo:

A screen coming from the UK. It's a fullscreen with a nice 
"floorscroller" saying "Dynamic Duo". Music by Crusaders. Better 
than average, really.
‚Rating: 6


Now we've reached the second disk... FINALLY

 Diskchange:

A disting disk that looks like a graphics man first attempt. Wings 
of Death music by Hippel. There are some bugs in this diskchange, 
for example insert the second disk before the diskchange screen 
appears. You still have to change the disk ?!?!?!?
‚Rating: 0


 Synergy:

Taataa... The best screen in this demo. Finally something that looks 
interesting. A starfield, a brilliant starwars scroller, some 
oneplane vectorballs (a bit jerky due to the misuse as vu-metres for 
the Mad Max music). This one is great!
‚Rating: 8


 The lower level:

The name of it says everything!
‚Rating: 1


 Impact & Genesis:

At least a mediocre multi-part screen. Chessboard, sinus dots and 
you can see a shite looking dot-scroller.
‚Rating: 5


 Zuul Circle Twister:

Where have I seen this scroller before? Yeah, on Amiga done by a 
group called 'Red Sector' in their 'Mega Demo'. Even the waveforms 
seem to be the same..... There's a disting logo and a looped sample 
- nothing left to say!
‚Rating: 2


 Replicants:

Mad Max sound, a swinging logo, a little magnify but an ugly font - 
looks quite good.
‚Rating: 5


 FMC-Connexion:

Jerky coloursplits (not too bad) together with three small 
scrollers in a fullscreen.
‚Rating: 2


 Crusaders:

Tracking sprites, vu-meters, system char scroller and crappy music.
‚Rating: 1


 Crusaders 2:

Techtechcrap, system font, again crap music and some sprites.
‚Rating: 1


 Pulsion:

A well done logo, the 'Gods' font, disting coloursplits scroller 
and a tube together with a Mad Max sound makes this screen to one 
of the better ones.
‚Rating: 6


 Zuul:

French text!!! It seems that no one in Zuul is able to speak 
English! Three nice logos.....
‚Rating: 1


 Zuul:

Again French text! But this screen is a good gag! Look yourself..
‚Rating: 4


 Resetdemo:

Just a stupid picture.... No exit by a second reset!!

Overall rating for N.T.M Megademo 1:  3 of 10 points

This demo is a complete bore and a waste of two disks. You might say 
that our slagging is not justified, but please have a look yourself. 
We could easily have given a higher rating, but that would have not 
been fair. We're trying to be honest and we don't care about any 
fuckings from crews we rated too less in their opinions.
At least nobody can say that we are bribed in any way. We even would 
do a deadly review of the stuff of our best friends if they do such 
a rubbish! We give a shit on friendship! We ˆhave to be HONEST!

If you are NOT satisfied with this review : DO SOMETHING AND WRITE 
US YOUR OPINION!!! We will put your article in the next issue for 
sure, if it's done in a constructive way.
