„Review by New Mode and Slime on 18.06.92


At long last a demo coming from WEST-Germany, ˆthe leading 
country some years ago. ACF had some major releases like the 
Bloodsucker demo and several screens in diverse Alliance 
productions, all of them just mediocre or even worse.

Since it's 11:15pm now and we both are extremely tired after a 
fabulous three hours Snillard marathon, we'll start off with the 
review. So excuse us for not adding some kind of literally 
valuable story like Richard always does. Also apologize our 
rather primitive English, none of us has ever had the chance of 
studying this all so important language. We're poor computer 
science students, so don't blame us too much („we wouldn't care 
anyway).„



 Intro:

Here you get the music of the wellknown Thalion intro, but this 
time it's noisetracked. Very nice. Some pleasant graphics 
(toothbrush style) and a text fading in/out. Good.


 Loader:

Scroller, tube, what do you want more?
Ah yeah - decrunching while playing the music. That's what we 
missed. Loading gets done quite fast, none of these pissing 
slowloaders where you can get yourself a cup of coffee (or 
screwing your girl).


 Menu:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Not again one of those extremely funny and original game 
lookalike menues!!!!!!!!!!

But wait, this one seems to be well done. So we can forget about 
our slaggings. It's in fullscreen, astonishing graphics, neat 
animation and pleasant music by TAO (ACF's new musician). You can 
control Charly (or what the hell the shape's called) with 
joystick and cursor keys without problems.
One of the best menus of this kind.


 Hiddenscreen:
 
Easy to get to this one. Just enter ACF in the menu.

Tracker music, pseudo graphics-colourdisting, logos moving up 
and down (one of them remembered us of a certain logo, ahem). 
There's a one plane scroller and a really nasty mistake in the 
antialiasing of the bottom logo.


 Bad Obsession:

The oldest screen they say. It's a complete rip off of TLB's 
screen in "Dark Side of the Spoon" (the screen with four 
different windows, each showing a different effect). Forget it, 
the screen could be outstanding, it's the worst and a shame for 
all in ACF!


 Sanity "Starwars Scroller":

A screen by an Amiga group (a decent one). Pretty impressive 
starwars scroller that spins around the x-axis. This screen shows 
that Amiga coders are fairly good at "pure" coding and not just 
at using their lot of custom chips. Music by Count Zero.


 Xenex - "Mate":

This screen is by a German group called Xenex Demozone 68000. 

Jeeeesssass, the music is awful. We had to pump down the volume 
immediately. Bleurgh... Never ever show this screen to any Amiga 
user or he will certainly laugh himself to pieces after he heard 
the music.
The screen itself is a multipart. It starts off with parallax 
scrolling moving backgrounds (all in one plane). After that you 
have to bear one of the worst logos in Atari history. (We really 
hope they hung the people responsible for the music and the 
graphics, hehe).
A bitbender tells you some stuff right inbetween the different 
parts.
A madcap with no colourcycling (strange, eh) is calculated then. 
Rather fast algorithm.
After that you'll see some really fast fractals and you even can 
control them afterwards (e.g. set your own parameters). Even 
fullscreen fractals can be done. Fast routine.
Uh, before we forget, an interference effect with two layers of 
circles can also be seen.
All in all, this screen is a bore at least to us.

Hey Ramses, long time since you wrote your last letter, what 
about some more ASM-style stuff? HarHarHar

 
 State of Confusion:

TECHTRON. BITPLANEMANIA. BOLLOCKS!

They're coming to take us away before we go berzerk.


 Just feel it:

Nice font, disting logo, big moving one plane graphics and a 
spinning ACF logo. Not bad, but not good. Average.


 Line of Fire:

Another pure piece of boredom. A fullscreen with a starfield, a 
swinging logo. We found no deeper meaning in the title of this 
screen, maybe we're just stupid, but this screen is stupid too.


 Electrolytical Artificial Intelligence:

"The most complex screen" they say. So we waited and waited for 
great things to happen. It was wasted time.

You get:
a) good graphics (cool font and a very nice logo with plasma in it)
b) a starfield
c) a one plane vertical scroller
d) one of the smallest filled vector graphics ever (lightsourced!!)
e) a tiny two plane bitbender
f) unimportant texts telling you about credits and used hardware

Parts c) to f) are not to be seen at the same time.

This screen was really a disappointment to us, we expected a lot 
more when we saw the excellent graphics. We call it a hype.


 Back off Bitch:

A left-right swinging smilie on a boring starfield. A big crystal 
scroller is there too - at least this looks worth loading the 
screen. By the way, this is a fullscreen - "wow"?! At the bottom 
there are some swinging and rotating logos and the music is just 
average. Boooooooooooring! Snore!


 Greetings Screen:

At the top there are parallaxed clouds and in the middle of your 
monitor appears a 4-plane scroller. Under this scroller some 
strange but good looking pictures move in and out. The sound is 
at least mediocre. All in all the aim is reached here.


 Mailbox-Info:

This one shows you the phone number of ACF's BBS. There's a 
module playing and some nice gfx....


 Ride the Sky:

The parallax scrolling looks like TCB's in the Union demo. Three 
bigger than average sprites saying A.C.F. fly around, a 1-plane 
scroller and a sprite animation is also to be seen. Oh well, 
nothing more to tell....


 The Victory:

This is the ICC #2 demo competition screen of ACF that ranked on 
one of the last places. You'll see a nice picture in the 
beginning then there's a starfield, some swinging logos, a 
scroller and crappy music. If you seen one of those screens, you 
saw all of them!


 Resetdemo:

Oh yeah! We always liked resetdemos that first have to be loaded 
after pressing the reset button. A strange picture, a 1-plane 
vertical scroller and a 4-track music that sounds just boring.



ACF have improved a lot since their last demo. Concerning 
graphics and musics they belong to the best groups in Germany 
now. But they still have a lack of outstanding coders!
