 CS!

Hello there!  If you,  dear reader,  are one of those 
enthusiastic hackers, who wants to study CS (Computer Science) in 
an university, read the following text carefully! It describes 
what your dream is really all about.

First of all,  if your social skills are on the pathetic side 
(and they  probably  are,  since you code all the time),  forget  
about finding  a girlfriend while studying CS.  You'll be lucky 
if five percent of freshmen will be females!  And those few 
either already have  a boyfriend or are at least coyote-ugly 
(that is,  when  you wake  up in the morning with a coyote-ugly 
girl,  and your arm is stuck under her,  you'll rather chew your 
arm off than risk waking her...)

Ah,  I hear you say,  you can find girlfriends elsewhere. Sure, 
if you go someplace else.  But more probably you'll go to the 
parties your  friends (who are like you) or older students 
arrange.  Guess how much girls there are? This is probably why so 
many CS students will be alcoholists in the future.  (Shit,  it's 
boring here.  I'd like  to  dance,  but  I ain't gonna dance with 
you guys  or  that double-coyote-ugly  girl in the corner.  So 
gimme another  beer... btw,  double-coyote-ugly  is  just like 
coyote-ugly,  but you chew both  of  your arms off,  so you'll 
never be in the  same  trouble again)

Still want to be a CS student? Ok, read on...

Let's skip girls now (maybe you go to a bar and drink so much 
that you  go to bed with a triple-coyote-ugly girl,  which is the  
case when  you bite your dick off so you don't ever never have to  
fuck her again) 
Ok,  next subject:  computers. Don't wet your pants when you see 
a workstation  or  some bigger machine for the  first  time...  
They really  aren't worth it.  Remember when you had a Speccy or 
a C64? When you got it for Xmas and played with it continuosly 
until  the new  year?  And now you can't stand the machine.  And 
when you got your   16-bit?   Played   with  it  until  the  end   
of   January (continuosly), but if you're not yet bored with it, 
you'll be some time.  Just  wait.  And that's what going to 
happen with all these Unix boxen and Vaxen.  Believe me, your 
interest in coding doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell when 
you have to write C  program from  scratch  and  the deadline is 
approaching  faster  than  you think.  And  C is a language you 
can stand,  even though you would have  wanted to do everything 
in assembly.  Try Lisp.  For most of the people who have taken a 
Lisp course,  shouting 'caddr!' brings tears in their eyes. The 
rest aren't human but aliens or robots.

How about your spare time then (assuming you have any)?  What 
have you planned to do? Code in assembly? Forget it. After 
banging your head to the wall with some stupid language you'll be 
so pissed off with  computers  that  you'll never want to see  
one  ever  again. (except with a flame thrower)

Still want to be a CS student? Loop to the start of text...
