
This is a review of all films I have seen to date starring the 
wonderful, talented actress Joanna Pacula.  Always very much 
underrated and little known in the UK, this should hopefully 
change.  Her work on all her films is always 100% excellent, and, 
as she appears to be of Canadian origin, I would like to make a 
statement to her, hopefully through the Maggie's Canadian 
distributors.

If, Joanna, you are reading this now, or if any of her close ST-
owning friends are reading this now and know where she is at this 
moment, please tell her or (if you are reading, Joanna) to PLEASE 
GET IN TOUCH!!

Joanna, you are such a talented person and I don't know how to 
thank you for the many pleasures you have given me in seeing you 
act in your films.  The best of luck comes from me - Richard - 
and I wish you all the best for the future!!!

Anyway, here is a rundown of her films so far seen by myself.


GORKY PARK

The first film introducing Miss Pacula to our screens.  Also 
starring a host of other names including William Hurt and Alexei 
Sayle, this film is about the Soviet Union, pre-Glasnost and the 
ending of the Cold War.  It tells the story of murders by a 
popular ice-rink of 2 men and 1 woman and the web since then.  
Joanna stars as the Russian girl, Irina.  The woman who was 
murdered at the ice-rink was wearing Irina's boots at the time, 
and so the story goes on.....However the film was and probably 
still is a hit in its time.  Well worth watching.


NOT QUITE JERUSALEM

An excellent comedy about some people who go to live on an 
Israeli kibbutz for 2 months.  Here Joanna plays Gila, a 
foul-mouthed "kibbutz-nik".  But she meets one of the male 
characters, falls in love, and tones down her language to the 
real Joanna we have all come to know.  Some hilarious moments in 
the film are with all of the characters, especially Bernard 
Strother and Kevin Mcnally, who play the characters of Dave and 
Pete.  Well worth watching but I think it is a bit hard to get 
hold of now.


ESCAPE FROM SOBIBOR

Probably the best film about the Nazi death camps to ever hit our 
screens - what is deadly is that the film is based on a very true 
story.  Joanna teams up with Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands) and 
Rutger Hauer (Guinness adverts) in this $4 million screen epic.  
She plays the character of Luka, who survived the Nazis games etc 
and managed to escape into the woods.  Many of the German stars 
who were not so well known before this film was made have now 
become celebrities.  Names such as Hartmut Becker, Kurt Raab and 
Emil Wolk come to mind.  Overall, an excellent war drama.  
*Screened on TV the first time, every pub in the UK was watching 
it!*  Well worth watching.


THE KISS (of death)

A bit far-fetched this one, but a well-made shocker that puts the 
jitters up anyone.  Joanna plays Felice (the witch) in the film.  
Her sister Hilary has a daughter called Amy (Meredith Salenger).  
Using a potion of witchcraft, Felice kills Hilary in what is 
termed a "freak accident".  Then Felice turns up in New York to 
see Amy.  Her visit strangely coincides with a series of deaths 
to Amy's friend, her boyfriend, the local Reverend etc.  Amy soon 
realises that, like Felice, she will be the next one to get the 
curse - but is saved in the nick of time.  Well worth watching - 
it is now available to buy on video.  100% excellent.


MARKED FOR DEATH

This is Stephen Seagal's most recent film.  Joanna doesn't appear 
much in it but when she does appear, she is excellent.  Seagal 
stars as John Hatcher, whose family was murdered, now he is for 
the chop.  Joanna plays the anthropologist, who helps Hatcher 
(Seagal) find out what various drawings etc are in his house etc.
Some excellent work with the special effects leads Hatcher to a 
showdown with some coloured guys - one good effect here is that 
he has cut off the head of Mr Big (whoever he is) and this head 
comes back to life again, complete with body etc!!!  An excellent 
action film - well worth watching.


Joanna has made some more films since these - I have found out 
about at least 3.  One of these is called Options, and is 
supposed to be about a Belgian princess who gets kidnapped etc.  
I haven't seen this yet, but if anyone out there has, PLEASE tell 
me about it care of the Maggie.

Well, I'll be back with more later.




Felice.
