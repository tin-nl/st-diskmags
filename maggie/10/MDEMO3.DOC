
 MDEMO 3 BY AN COOL OF TCB

‚(reviewed by Big Alec, New Mode & Slime on 11.06.1992)

The first thing which appears when the demo is being loaded is a 
text which tells you to adjust the volume of your amplifier 
according to a silent tone buzzing from the speaker. When you have 
done that you have to press space to go on. If you happen to  not
know the demo already, we give you the advice to be very careful 
with your volume knob! To know why, simply read on...
After the text has vanished into blackness, a well-drawn dragon 
appears accompanied by a roaring heavy-metal sample. Beneath the 
dragon the logo "M-DEMO 3" fades in. Then the whole screen is 
faded away again and some kinda fast spinning cube comes tumbling 
towards you while transforming into a flat horizontal line. Suddenly 
the screen flashes white and an one-plane-logo saying AN Cool 
appears. This all happens very fast and is extremly stunning indeed. 
Not really the code, but the effect in general. After the logo has 
disappeared again, big magnified chars bounce up and down again 
saying M-demo 3. A quick slap on the space bar exits this screen.
The rating for this part is -7-.
Coming up next is the loader-screen, which consists of a big 
scroller with sinusing rasters in it. In the background there is a 
3D-starfield, but there are some bugs in it as some stars are not 
removed. A pair of big hex-numbers indicate the remaining sectors to 
be loaded from the disk. Below the scroller there is a bunch of 
four volume indicators with randomly flickering rasters in them. 
These indicators are controlled by a tracker-module, which might be 
recognized by some of you as similiar to the one of the Replicants 
intro. For those of you, who don't know that intro, let me say, that 
it is a very nice tekkno-tune.
The loader-screen rates 6.
The next thingy to come up is a truly nice one, indeed. The screen 
starts with pure blackness and a (TCB-)tracker-module. 
Synchronously to the music the letters A-N-C-O-O-L are displayed, 
faded away, and faded in at a different position again. Then some 
sort of credits are flashed in, whereas every (char-)line has a 
different flashing color. I have to stress this here: The code is 
very well synchronized to the music. After the credits the screen 
fades to black again. Next there is a blue background which consists 
of a scrolling-boxes-pattern. The direction of the pattern scrolling 
changes continously. Not the whole screen at once, but step-by-step.
The main effect in this screen is a 3D-char-zoomer. This means, the 
characters are sprites moving in x-, y- and z-direction. The zooming 
is very soft and fluent, the waveforms are great designed and the 
chars can become very big. The screen is acoustically surrounded by 
another excellent tune by AN Cool. Ah, yes, in the background there 
is a very nice TCB-logo in one bitplane.
This excellent screen rates a massive -9-!
The next screen in the demo is supposed to be a lame demo, just like 
the ones we saw at the Mega Leif Convention this Easter in Uppsala. 
It starts off with the most weird horizontal starfield ever to be 
seen. It seems it has colorcycling on the colors of the stars. Out 
of the black background a well known sign fades in - the Atari logo.
In fact it is the animation from the good old Fujiboink demo. This 
becomes obviously, when it starts spinning and bouncing around. A 
few moments later the starfield fades away again and instead of it a 
chequered background in white and red appears. The spinning Atari-
sign causes a shadow on the background. The music in the screen is, 
guess..., acid-tekkkkno (wow, 4 k's! bliip-bliip!). Another little 
part of that screen consists of a couple of balls bouncing around.
Unfortunately this screen does not reach its aim, as it's far too 
good for a lame demo. The rating for it is 6.
The last part is the longest. It is a truly complete tekkno demo. It 
starts off with a sample saying "Being a carebear takes a lot of 
skill...". Then the rave begins... The screen consists mostly of 
weird colorflashes, levelmeters and a great animation (A racist 
would call it "a stomping soap-dodger". Yo bimbo!) (ED.: We are NO 
racists!). The music is of course boasting. This screen is the 
funniest of the demo and it rates 8.

 Overall Rating :  7.5

If the demo would run a bit more stable, it would have got a better 
rating, but alas the loader crashes sometimes due to memory garbage.
