„A game review by Slime done on 21.06.1992


Ok, ok...... I have to confess that this game isn't up to date, but 
as it wasn't reviewed in any disk-magazine...... (you know; always 
the same reason is written here!).


I put the disk in the drive (the disk goes „Caboing because I missed 
the slit!). Next try! Success! „Whirr krrr whirr krrr..... it seems 
that my disk drive has seen better days eh? After some friendly 
persuasion (to be precise: some hits with the fist!) the disk goes 
„whirrrk whirrrk whirrrk - that sounds a bit better now.

After a short loading time, a manual check is coming up. A real well 
drawn picture of a man with a high hat on his head appears wanting 
to know some stuff from the manual. But there are some worse 
mistakes in the antialiasing.....

Entering the code and pressing Return - the picture fades out and„ 
another picture showing a war scene out of the time of Napoleon 
comes up - but it looks really shite! And the music is a torture for
the ears! Iiiiiik! Press space to get out of this horror!

Again „whirrrrkl whirrrrkl..... the main game is loaded.

If you don't know what 'Startego' is, then here's a little 
description:
On a 10x10 board there are two armies facing each other. Each army 
contains 40 pieces, that the opponent isn't able to look at. You 
have six bombs and one flag that you aren't allowed to move. The 
other 33 pieces are soldiers of all ranks (from a scout over a 
captain to a marshal). The aim of the game is to conquer the enemy 
flag or to obtain immovability of your opponent (mainly in killing 
all his soldiers, unless he wasn't that stupid to lock some of them 
between bombs!).

The graphics of the game look quite nice. Like the original game 
gfx. You also have the choice between three different boards and two 
piece sets (but the block piece set is a real impudence!!!).
For all the unexperienced guys there are some set-up's on disk, so 
that you don't have to think long about an own strategy. You can 
save your own set-up's too.
But wait! What is that? „Igitt! Right now I removed all pieces from 
the right side to the playfield and now notice the 'marmor' effect 
on the board where the pieces were - EXTREMLY UGLY! I think even my 
sisters baby is able to do it better!
So much for the graphics! But what about the intelligence of the 
programme?
Well, you have the possibility to set your opponent's level, but I 
have to say that I didn't notice any difference between them - the 
computer always lost because of some major mistakes he did in each 
game independent of the gamelevel.

That's the reason - and it is the only reason - that the Accolade 
Stratego isn't worth buying for an experienced gambler, but if you 
are just a bloody beginner, the game will fits your standard.

The playability of the game is just average because the computer 
have to check if the move you did, was a correct one - and he does 
it in a slow way. The game itself is controlled by mouse which was 
well done. The game sound is annoying...... that's all I want to say 
about it (and it's all I can say about it)!

To the coder of the game (if he ever read this): You don't have to 
include a 'Quit' option if it doesn't work the way it should! A 
simple message like 'Remove your Stratego disk and switch off your 
computer' is a bit annoying! I can switch off my computer without 
your 'Quit' function! Dozy idiot!

Let us come to an end now.......
