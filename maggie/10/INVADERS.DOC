ÑAnother ÜincompetentÑ game review done by Slime on 26.06.1992


SPACE INVADERS is back! And this time it proclaims to be SUPER! This 
review will show if it earns this title.....

After 60 seconds a fantastic, mindblasting, really funny, and 
extremly well done cartoon-like intro is shocking your monitor! 
This intro runs like a movie and it is the best one I have ever 
seen. At the end of the intro a voice says 'Space Invaders' in a 
real good sample qualitiy....

Now it's diskchange time..... Press 'Space'.....
loading......

loading....

HOAR! That was a nice effect! And now you are able to see the intro 
picture again! And, WOW! a fine digisound for my Ç(nearly deaf) ears!
That's what I call a intro! Some demo people should look AND learn 
from it!
Pressing 'Space'.... short loading... and now you can hear the blib-
blob of the digimusic. A big TAITO logo, the title screen, some more 
pictures and a story to explain you why the invaders have 
returned...   All graphics are done very well. I like it....
Now let's see if the game itself is worth the intro stuff!
Pressing fire..... loading.....

You have the choice between 'normal' or 'advanced' game......

After I selected normal I see 12 different zones, but I'm only able 
to select two of them. After I selceted my zone another nice cartoon 
comes up. Really funny.

loading.....

The game starts....
An attacking squad of invaders were blasted by the gun.... You can 
collect some useful and badly needed extras - some shield, a laser, 
etc. BUT..... the real feeling won't come up for me! The whole 
action is a bit slow and slows down even more when a lot of action 
is on the screen (many opponents, the extraship, some shoots...)
After I finished the first zone, a 'Defender'-like game starts....
CATTLE MUTILATION is the name. You have to protect some cattle 
against the bad guys here! Do it by blasting them as soon as 
possible, because some of them steal your animals....
Although it is an old idea, it is done quite good and a refreshing 
change from the Ñnormal blasting.

After I spent my last credit and destroyed my last ship, the game is 
over (what else have you waited for?). A nice picture showing your 
pilot flying through the space without his ship (hehehe). The 'Game 
Over' music fits perfect and if you were good enough to enter the 
High-Score list you have to select your chars in a new way. The 
chars are flying around in an '8' circle.

The final comment!
The graphics are great, the sound is brilliant but the code is 
disappointing!
Well, and after a 'Game Over' I don't think it is necessary to fill 
the whole memory with the digisound of the intro again. That sucks 
if you want to do a fast retry!
