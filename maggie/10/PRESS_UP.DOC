
 PRESS-UP COMPETITION

„A call to all computer people in the whole world


As we are planning an I.C.C. #3 in 1993, we tought about new 
competitions for such a meeting. Well, New Mode and me are doing 
press-ups all the time „(we are just average!) and so we had this 
idea to do a competition between computer groups on the party.
You probably know the prejudice, that all computer people are slim 
and weak freaks doing nothing else than hacking and gambling! We 
want to prove the world „(or at least the ST-scene) that this isn't 
true!
As the party will happen around Eastern '93, you have enough time 
to train yourself for the competition.

How to do correct press-ups:

1. Lie on the floor on your stomach with both hands, palm down, as 
close as possible to your chest.

2. Your legs are extended and together. You prop your body on the 
toes and the hands. The stomach and your balls are NOT allowed to 
have contact with the floor.

3. Your back is extended too. Don't swing in your hips when doing 
press-ups. That's what I call the „fucking motion. And that's wrong.

4. Breathe out when you push yourself up, breathe in when going down 
(without touching the floor with your body!).


DELTA FORCE challenge all groups in the ICC #3 PRESS-UP COMPETITION!

Well, now you only need training and an invitation! Invitations will 
be send in very late '92 or early '93. Tough shit if you won't get 
one (hawhawhaw)!
