
   …PEOPLE OF PLANET EARTH, YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE....
„
 (Er, that comes later in a little thing I am doing with some 
samples..)

Right then, it may have come to your notice that Maggie has been 
away a rather long time, enough time for several issues of the 
Untouchables Ledgers thingy to emerge in fact..

The slowness of Maggie is due in part to a slowdown in articles 
since Maggie moved to Germany and joined Delta Force. For some 
people, particularly in the UK, the old saying 'Continent cut-off 
by fog' still holds true, the idea of writing to Germany seems to 
be a bit of a step into the 'unknown, even though this is not 
true.

The other problem has been down to the difficulty of our esteemed 
editor Mike Schussler „aka Sammy Joe, who has had exams and various 
other projects coming out of his ears. As a consequence, Maggie 
has not been appearing as nearly as regularly as we would like it 
to... „Now read on..

„(The other basic fact to bear in mind, is of course most people 
are chronically lazy bastards.. But that is an old, old story..)

Issue Ten is due out ' Real soon', almost as we speak, this has 
taken me by surprise (9th July 1992) somewhat, and this article 
along with other stuff I've done will have to go in the post very 
quickly to make it in time, and I have not even done half of the 
stuff I wanted to do yet...

Thanks and greetings must go to the people who have already 
written in after issue 9, Techwave of the Inner Circuit Explorers, 
who kindly supplied a copy of their STE demo collection (Which was 
reviewed in time...) and ISO of Sewersoft who kindly sent two 
articles to me recently, these are also on the 'Express Delivery' 
disc to Maggie GHQ..

To all the other people who have written in over the past six 
months with stamped addressed envelopes, and who are still waiting 
to hear, sorry, and hang on, I will get round to you (My printer 
will finally be fixed very shortly..) To the Supervisiors (The 
Polish Guys who did an intro on Maggie 5, and who have written to 
me in the past …Please get in touch soon...

Maggie is to remain a Delta Force production, and is no longer to 
be distributed via Budgie due to certain '„er incompatabilities in 
"Style" (Too many naughty words...) and content.. „This is part of 
a general purge by Budgie, and takes in other titles too.. Again, 
this is to be finalised, but an alternative main distributor has 
been named (Riverdene PDL). 
„Note to Southwest PDL:- You will never hear from Budgie …at a„l…l„
regarding Maggie...

We hope to resume production on a much more regular basis, that is 
Bi-monthly, (Or as nearasdammit.) but to go back to the title of 
this little piece, as always, this depends on You, (People of 
Planet Earth..) becos' if I have to write all of this myself, two 
things happen.

1. Everybody gets fed up with the same style of article, I believe 
that one of Maggie's great features has been its diversity of 
content on the writing side. I am personally still waiting for the 
sequel to the great issue 2 article 'Story of a Baby'...

2. The production lead times get much longer (But not much longer 
than at the moment???)

Anyway, articles, source code, intro's and demos to the new 
contact address in the UK please.. „(Cut out that faffing about 
with international reply coupons, write to me here in the UK, you 
know it makes sense..) People in Europe, don't worry, Mike and the 
other Delta Force Boys will keep you in touch..

…          That 'Death of the ST' thing in full..

An end to the fashionable doom and gloom editorials??

You may recall a little article in issue 8, 'The STEE revealed', 
you then may recall the April issues of the big name ST magazines 
'breaking' this news.. Since then, speculation is centering around 
a 68030 based machine, the Falcon, which is being "Introduced to 
the development community" to use Atari's own words. Anticipated 
launch dates, Autumn for the US and Germany, and 'early 1993' for 
us lucky people in the UK,.(„So they want someone to sell a lot of 
PC's  this Xmas!?!?!) It may well be the case that Maggie will, be 
there too!! Watch this space!!!

Two little things, "They" (Atari that is,) still seem to be 
talking of an Autumn release, if this is later in the UK, do you 
not see the growth of a 'Grey Import' market, the first for an 
Atari machine!?! Also, it may be interesting to note that a basic 
(2MB, no hard drive or monitor, 1.44MB floppy) TT can now be had 
for œ900.00, this is only 50% higher than the anticipated price 
for the Falcon, interesting, hmmmm....

…                  S T O P  P R E S S ! ! !  ! ! ! !
This is some very hot (9th July type) news, expect to see the 
Falcon at the Dusseldorf Show in August, it may even be on 
sale!!!! The basic price could be even lower than expected!!!

Hopefully, this is my „very last piece for this issue, (I started 
writing back in December last!!)
