
 OVERDOSE DEMO

by Aggression

„Review by New Mode and Slime on 18.06.92


One of the first big demos coming from Funland. This demo took 
part in the demo competition at the Megaleif party in Sweden and 
got second. If you see the rating at the end, you'll sure wait 
with baited breath for the winner of the competition : Omega.

The guys in Aggression tried to bring a whole style of demo to 
the Atari. No menu, just like all the Amiga demos. One can say, 
that this sucks, but regarding all the minigame menues nowadays, 
we're quite happy about the fact that you don't have to search 
for ages to get to a screen. An alternative little menu would 
have been very nice though. 

Every screen has it's own very nice loading picture, interlaced 
but still far off the average ST pics. Seems Aggression's painter 
is doing his graphics on an Amiga, eh?

Let's see through each screen, in the order Xenit put them onto 
the disk...

 Intro:

Quite neat tracker music, some text fading in and out and a 
splendid Overdose logo. Seems like the graphics artist is a drug 
addict due to all his realistic work... hehe!


 Eksabender:

There's a massive oneplane bitbender, really big. Tough shit for 
New Mode since he already planned that kind of screen for the 
next demo. Good work, Xenit. After a very short time, there's a 
picture displayed showing some strange "asiatic" graphics. One 
keypress more and the screen is done... Digidrum music by Synth 
Dream fits the screen quite well.

 
Realtime Postscript Zoomer:

Some zooming characters in one plane (really looks like the 
"Times" version of a certain postscript font). If it's really 
realtime, it's fairly ok. Meanwhile there's some looped sample 
playing from Genesis latest album : "I can't dance" (hey Xenit, 
wasn't it bizarre at the local tekkno party in Uppsala? We all 
had a good time on the dancefloor, raving and stomping around 
like mad!). Then again, there's a picture displayed telling you 
that "postscript is aggressive". (is it?). Concluding, a good 
screen, but it would have been better as an intro for a demo, not 
in the middle of a demo.


 Plasma Fractals:

Some calculated landscape fractals and a background picture. 
Boring.


 Glenz Vectors:

As the name says, you're going to adore some "glenz vectors" 
here. Seen a lot of time on Amiga, but this amazing idea has 
never been used on ST so far. What are glenz vectors? They are 
simply vectors where you can see through the faces and see the 
usually hidden faces. Makes up a good effect and costs a lot of 
CPU time since you've gotta draw all the faces and there's no 
chance in skipping the hidden ones. Have a look yourself, the 
object is also transforming. Great music by Synergy, first time 
used in Electra's PYM screen. One of the best screens in the 
demo.


 Raytraced Animation:

Another cool idea coming from Amiga. A precalculated raytraced 
starship is rotating (of course precalculated, or are you able to 
do realtime raytracing, dumbfuck?). It really looks ace.


 Vertical Bars:

Vertical rasters and a disting one plane logo. Yawn!


 Shade Sprites:

Another goodie from Amiga.  Very hard to describe but a nice 
effect in general. The waveforms are not very good here and the 
whole screen seems to be moved some scanlines down. One thing is 
very much annoying : you can't exit the screen when you want to. 
You have to wait for all waveforms to pass by. 


 Fractal Landscapes:

As the "plasma fractals" before, this screen is a total bore. 
Some mountain fractals are calculated and displayed. Don't watch 
this screen in a mood of extreme tireness, or you'll fall asleep 
for sure.


 Endscreen:

One plane vertical scroller, noisetracked music, and some photos 
of several Aggression members (good quality). It's ok.

You can't exit the demo with your reset button, and that sucks 
for sure.

Concluding : One of the best demos recently, a lot of ideas have 
been copied from Amiga demos, but that's not really a fault 
regarding all the boring demos we're forced to see at the moment.
The design of the demo lacks a bit since none of the screens 
fades in or out and the effects don't fit to each other and build 
each other up.
