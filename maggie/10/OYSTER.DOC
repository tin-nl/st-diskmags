
 AURA: THE WORLD IS MY OYSTER

‚Review by Big Alec / Delta Forceˆ

Today is monday the 16th of June 1992 at around half past 1 am. This 
is the day after I came home from Stuttgart, where I visited New Mode 
and Slime for a couple of days. Now I am sitting in front of my 
truSTy (and rusty!) computer since about 6 hours already. Not 
necessary to say, that my eyelids feel like falling down any minute 
now, but as this issue has to be filled up to the brim once again, I 
eventually got myself up to write this article. I hope you like it. 
Here we go...

As usual, the first thing a demo does when loading itself is, to 
switch the background colour to black. This one is not different. So 
here we got it - darkness. A moment later a small info text comes up 
telling you, how to copy the disk. When loading is finished and the 
volume of your monitor speakers is not turned down completely, you 
can hear a silent buzzing and in a way mysterious sound. An anti-
aliased-Calamus-font text appears saying "In the year 1992 Axxis is 
dead. A new crew was born...". The buzzing sound slowly becomes 
louder and louder, and finally, accompanied with a rather simple 
"AURA" logo, it turns into a clear tone. Swush! Very nice effect, 
guys! It somewhat reminds me of the Lucasfilm THX-sound 
advertisement in cinema. A minor disadvantage is only, that the 
sample stops quite abruptly.

After having pressed space, the loader-screen comes up. It consists 
of an info text telling you, who coded what (But not, why. Haha!), 
etc. The music is a relatively new one by Mad Max (Lethal Xcess 
loading sound, I suppose, but I'm not sure...). The frog from "Magic 
Pockets" jumps from the left to the right, and his red-flashing eyes 
indicate, when depacking is finished. Quite nice...

To get this article finished soon, I'll just give you a quick review 
of each screen...
ˆ
ˆFirst screen: "Where the hell is my hankerchief?" by Shadow (BDC)

Accompanied by the Thalion-Intro music, a big one-plane 1992 logo 
comes scrolling into the screen from the right. Inside of the logo 
dozens of rasters make the thingy more colourful, but the colours are 
some of the worst I have ever seen. In the background there is 
something, which looks like "scrolling achieved by colourcycling" in 
blue. A one-plane gothic text says "Shadow of Aura". As soon as the 
music changes, the 1992-logo starts wobbling, and a medium-sized 
one-plane scroller rolls horizontally across the screen. Not very 
original (to be honest, it's disgusting...).

ˆSecond screen: "What a Laber Suelz Partytext" by Chris

The title is a mixture of German/English and means "What a 
drivelling real-time article". The main effect of this screen is a 
sync-scrolling text displayer. The viewer is able to scroll it up 
and down via the cursor keys. When <Shift> is held while scrolling, 
it scrolls by 8 pixels per frame instead of one without shift. 
Another effect are the (mostly) 50 Hz hidden-line vector graphics. 
These are really well done. The objects are big, complex enough and 
they are clipped and even faded in and out. The music comes  from 
Lethal X-cess this time. With F1-F7 you can select different tunes. 
Just to mention it - the music uses digidrums. The background colour 
is NOT black as usual, but dark blue. Although it seems to be silly 
to care about the background colour, I consider it very important 
meanwhile. When you watch the latest Amiga demos a bit more careful, 
you will notice, that almost none of these use black as a background 
colour anymore. The demo automatically gains style when a decent 
shade of, say, blue supports the scene. Very nice! Although this 
screen seems not to be unbeatable (seen from the technical view), it 
does make a good impression. The quite fast vector graphics, the 
upper & lower border open, a sync-scrolling text displayer (I think 
it is even in med-res, isn't it?) and a digi-drum tune playing - 
This screen is definitely the best of the whole demo.


ˆThird screen: "Do you really want this cabbage???"

This screen is in fact rather a political joke than an ordinary demo-
screen. You know, our german chancellor Kohl is not really what one 
could call a popular person. With other words - he is made fun of. A 
picture of a pear with a face on it (which is not very dissimiliar 
to that of the aforementioned person) appears, and a sample is being 
played (at around 20 kHz). This sample is in german and goes like 
this: "Hallllooo, isch binns wieda, Euer Hellllmud!" (something 
like: "Hello, it's me again, yours (truly) Helmut!"). This speech 
sample is followed by a choir singing the Hallelujah by G.F. H„ndel. 
After this the demo exits immediately. The code is by Chris, the 
pear is by Clash, and the sample comes from the Apple Macintosh. 
Nothing impressive really, but definitely a good laugh for the 
germans! Funny!


ˆFourth screen: "Klein, fies & eklig" ("Tiny, mean & disgusting")

ˆby Cody

This screen is another one of that kind, which switches on all the 
effects one by one. First a scroller in the lower border and a single 
raster line. Then a starfield in the lower border as well. Next the 
music is switched on (a digidrum music from Turrican by MM). As the 
main screen is still black, we can expect yet another effect. And 
there it is - two one-plane circle-playfields swinging over each 
other, blackness, where they overlap, and thus generating 
interferences. Just like we've seen it before in the "Komische 
Sackratten von der H”hle" a/k/a "Zonk!"-screen from the Ooh Crikey 
wot a scorcher! demo by TLB. Only that the displayed playfield is 
bigger (Not really difficult, as he doesn't play a four-channel tune 
at 8 kHz...). Nice, but not very impressive...
Cody announced, that it was his last demoscreen, and that he will 
code utilities using GEM & VDI in the future. Good luck, Cody...


ˆGreetings- & Storyscroller by Shadow (BDC)

Again this is a raster-scroller like the one from Count Zero in the 
Decade Demo, only that the Chars are more than double as high 
(nearly 200 Pix.). It must have been an awful job to design these. 
Some colors are disgusting, but most of them suit. At the bottom of 
the screen there is a small (16 high) 3-plane scroller. I have not 
read the scrollers, so I don't know, which one is the greetings- and 
which one is the storyscroller... By pressing F1-F8 you're able to 
look at some digitized pictures with the faces of the Aura- (and 
Xenex-) members on them along with a satiric comment. The music is 
from Stormlord. Well,...........


ˆEndpart - by Chris

In the middle of the screen is an Aura logo by Clash (I hope it is 
not one of his best!). Beneath the logo there comes a 12.5 Hz (!) Up-
scroller telling you some bullshit. Guys, that scroller is definitely 
too SLOW!!! The music is by Lap (one of his better tracks - no, not 
the Aciiid tune!). That is ALL! Nothing more. Very poor, guys!


 Ratings:

Graphics: 3
Music:    8
Code:     4
Overall:  5

As said before, the best screen is the real-time article with the 
nice vectors, but the rest is mostly crap. Sorry guys!
