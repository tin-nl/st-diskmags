A screen by screen account of a pixellated journey into hell!!

„"It's really good value for only a thousand pounds" screen, 
Constantly repeating scrolltext, with the above message, also 
things like, "You get a free copy of DOS 5.0 thrown in, and 
„Windows." also, "All prices exclusive of VAT..", and, "You don't 
mean to say you're actually „poor?!?!"" This led to the now famous 
riposte on the Amiga, the "No, most people don't fucking well have 
a thousand pounds to throw around, and why doesn't someone tell 
the Mainstream computer press this!!" Demo.

„Wobbly company logo's scrolling unsteadily becos' they were 
programmed in 'C', or something.. Screen..

„Bald Git in a suit screen, Lavishly digitised screen of the man

fully stretched to accomodate some sound!!, the tune 'Happy 
Birthday to You' warbles out of the single channel piezo electric 
key clicker speaker..
„
Windows memory checker screen.. The legendary „Windows GUI installs 
itself into „all your available memory, and then wants some more!!! 
A magical monster eating everything in sight type game, can you

(In reviewers circles, otherwise known as the "Hey wow! isn't 
everything on the PC absolutely wonderful, until we actually get 
to try it." Screen..)
„
Can you afford a Gas-Plasma screen, and a laser printer, we think 
you can Screen, also contains 3 million, 937  advertisments for 
Taiwanese SVGA graphics cards and three pages with actual 
articles..

I think the joke has gone far enough screen:-

I wrote this piece because I have a good friend who has one 
irritating habit, he thinks the PC is the best computer in the 
world.. He also does not currently own a computer, and like me, is 
not likely to be able to afford to spend œ1000 plus on one, but 
still persists in the view, I should ditch the Atari and get one.. 

Hi there AJ!!!

More seriously, I hate the PC more than the Amiga, as with the 
Amiga, although it is a rival system, at least they are doing 
similar things, in the same spirit, it is perhaps better to talk 
about the sixteen bit Market, rather than just Atari or Commodore, 
as the PC is the greatest threat to both, not each other, as 
previously thought.. I don't mind if the PC stays in it's own 
natural marketplace, the business community, or those people in 
the USA with money to burn, but what is worrying, is the 
substained campaign to run down the 16 bit machines, and promote 
the PC as their natural successors...

Soon, the most desirable software will only be available on 
systems out of reach of many pockets, Power without the price, I 
think not!!

Atari and Commodore have allowed the situation to slip by them, by 
taking a half-hearted approach, it is only now, that there are 
signs of movement, and urgently needed new machines. If either 
company are still inclined to act slowly, there may be a chance 
that they will lose a lot of potential customers for good, who are 
looking to upgrade..

Serious bit over, I look forward to the old, deadly 
Commodore/Atari rivalry continuing on a new generation of (32 
bit?) machines.....

DEATH TO THE P.C.!!!!   (In our marketplace at least..)
