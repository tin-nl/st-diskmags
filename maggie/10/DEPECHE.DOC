This is no real article, it's just a collection of DM lyrics.

Depeche Mode are still some of the best electronic music artists, 
despite the fact that too many teenagers like their music.

"A Photograph of You" - A Broken Frame

What good is a photograph of you?
Every time I look at it,
It makes me feel blue!

What use is a souvenir
Of something we once had,
When all it ever does is
Make me feel bad!

I wish I could tear it up,
But then again I haven't the guts!
I wish I could throw it on the fire,
I wish I could,
But to say I would,
I'd be a liar!

What good is a color print
Of a little baby doll?
When just one little glance
Is enough to make me feel dull!

I hoped I would misplace it,
But then I take such good care of it.
I wish it would disappear,
I say I wish,
But then I relish
It being here!

What good is a photograph of you?
Every time I look at it,
It makes me feel blue.
Every time I look at it,
It makes me feel blue.


"A Question Of Lust" - Black Celebration

Fragile
Like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me
I'd never willingly
Do you harm

Apologies
Are all you seem to get from me
But just like a child
You make me smile
When you care for me
And you know...

It's a question of lust
It's a question of lust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Independence
Is still important for us though (we realize)
It's easy to make 
The stupid mistake
Of letting go (do you know what I mean)

My weakness
You know each and every one (it frightens me)
But I need to drink
More than you seem to think
Before I'm anyone's
And you know...

It's a question of lust
It's a question of lust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together

Kiss me good-bye
When I'm on my own
But you know that I'd
Rather be home

It's a question of lust
It's a question of lust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together


"A Question Of Time" - Black Celebration 

I've got to get to you first
Before they do
It's just a question of time
Before they lay their hands on you
And make you just like the rest
I've got to get to you first
It's just a question of time

Well now you're only fifteen
And you look good
I'll take you under my wing
Somebody should
They've persuasive ways
And you'll believe what they say

It's just a question of time
It's running out for you
It won't be long
Until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to do

I can see them now

Hanging around
To mess you up
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one

It's just a question of time
It's running out for you

It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to do
It won't be long 
Until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to do

Sometimes I don't blame them
For wanting you
You look good
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
And I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds

It's just a question of time

It should be better
It's just a question of time
It should be better with you
It's just a question of time


"And Then" - Construction Time Again
                                        
Let's take a map of the world
Tear it into pieces
All of the boys and girls
Will see how easy it is

(Chorus)
To pull it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith or, I prefer,
To think that things couldn't turn out worse

All that we need at the start
Universal revolution
(That's all)
And if we trust in our hearts
We'll find a solution

(Chorus)

I took a plane across the world
And got in a cold
And when I reached my destination
I hadn't got that far
Let's take a hold of the world
The mountains and the sand
Let all the poisons loose
Shape it in their hands

(Chorus to end)


"Any second now"- Speak and Spell

She remembered all the shadows in the dark
It's the same film
Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty
And the night's so still

Such a small affair, a relapse
Someone closing like the nightclub door

Here again and when you speak I watch you move away
And seem so sure

She is hoping to forget and the moment almost slips away
When the colors move apart and I wonder if you want to stay

And I need to change you
Like the words I'm reading
Don't you understand
Is the warning and the message
I remember as you touch my hand


"Behind The Wheel" - Music For The Masses 

My little girl
Drive anywhere
Do what you want
I don't care
Tonight
I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself
Over on a plate
Now

Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
I'd rather not be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything
Please

Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
I'm yours to keep
Do what you want
I'm going cheap
Tonight

You're behind the wheel tonight


"Behind The Wheel/Route 66" - Megamix transcribed from the Promo CD5

My little girl
Drive anywhere
Do what you want
I don't care
Tonight
I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself
Over on a plate

Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
I'd rather not be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything

Well if you ever plan to motor west
Travel my way, take a highway, that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it winds from Chicago to L.A.
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
I'm yours to keep
Do what you want
I'm going cheap
Tonight

You're behind the wheel
You're behind the wheel

Well it goes to St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma City looks - oh so pretty
You'll see Amarillo,
Gallup- New Mexico
Flagstaff- Arizona, don't forget Wynona.
Kingman, Bosco, San Bernadino
If you get hip to this kind of tip
then you'll take that California trip
get your kicks on route 66

get your kicks on route 66

You're behind the wheel
You're behind the wheel
You're behind the wheel


"Black Celebration" - Black Celebration 

Let's have a black celebration
Black Celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

I look to you
How you carry on
When all hope is gone
Can't you see

Your optimistic eyes
Seem like paradise
To someone like
Me

I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

Black Celebration
Black Celebration
Tonight

To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

I look to you 
And your strong belief
Me, I want relief
Tonight

Consolation
I want so much
Want to feel your touch
Tonight

Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today

Black celebration
I'll drink to that
Black celebration
Tonight


"Blasphemous Rumors" - Some Great Reward 

Girl of 16
Whole life ahead of her
Slashed her wrists
Bored with life
Didn't Succeed
Thank the lord
For small mercies

Fighting back the tears
Mother reads the note again
16 candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame
It's always the same
She goes down on her knees 
And prays

I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumors
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humor
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing

Girl of 18
Fell in love with everything
Found new life 
In Jesus Christ
Hit by a car
Ended up
On a life support machine

Summer's day
As she passed away
Birds were singing
In the summer sky
Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye

I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumors
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humor
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing


"Blue Dress" - Violator 

Put it on
And don't say a word
Put it on
The one that I prefer
Put it on
And stand before my eyes
Put it on
And please don't question why

Can you believe
Something so simple
Something so trivial
Makes me a happy man
Can't you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn
You'll know what makes the world turn

Put it on
I can feel so much
Put it on
I don't need to touch
Put it on
Here before my eyes
Put it on
Because you realize
And you believe

Something so worthless
Serves a purpose
It makes me a happy man
Can't you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn
You'll know what makes the world turn.


"Boys say go" - Speak and Spell

You don't understand
This is in demand
And I think that I have to show you

Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night get to know you

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys it's forever
Don't say no boys say go

I could run away
If you never stay
And the rain and pain and the sorrow

I'm not very sure
When you close the door
In the end it's the same as tomorrow

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys it's forever
Don't say no boys say go

You don't understand
This is in demand
And I think that I have to show you

Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night get to know you

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys it's forever 
Don't say no boys say go


"But Not Tonight" - Black Celebration

Oh God it's raining
But I'm not complaining
It's filling me up
With new life

The stars in the sky
Bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way
Tonight

And I haven't felt so alive 
In years

Just for a day
On a day like today
I'll get away from
This constant debauchery

The wind in my hair
Makes me so aware
How good it is to live
Tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights

But they're not like tonight

Oh God it's raining
And I'm not containing
My pleasure at being
So wet

Here on my lawn
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone
Tonight

And I haven't felt so alive
In years

The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes have been so red
I've been mistaken for dead

But not tonight


"Clean" - Violator
 
Clean
The cleanest I've been 
An end to the tears 
And the in-between years 
And the troubles I've seen 
Now that I'm clean 

You know what I mean 
I've broken my fall 
Put an end to it all 
I've changed my routine 
Now I'm clean 

I don't understand 
What destiny's planned 
I'm starting to grasp 
What is in my own hands 
I don't claim to know 
Where my holiness goes 
I just know that I like 
What is starting to show 
Sometimes 

Clean... 
As years go by 
All the feelings inside 
Twist and they turn 
As they ride with the tide 
I don't advise 
And I don't criticize 
I just know what I like 
With my own eyes 
Sometimes 
Clean... 

Sometimes... 


"Dangerous" - Released on Single

The things you do,
Aren't good for my health
The moves you make,
You make for yourself
Although they do,
They're the one's that I would choose

I wouldn't want it any other way
You wouldn't let me any way

(Chorus)
Dangerous,
The way you lead me onto more
Dangerous,
That's what I want you for
Dangerous,
When I am in you arms
Dangerous,
No, I will come to harm

The lies you tell,
Aren't meant to deceive
They are not there, for me to believe
I hurt, your vicious words
You know by now
It takes alot to see me hurt

I couldn't take it any other way
But there is a price that I must pay

(Chorus)

Dangerous (4x)

(Chorus 2x)


"Dreaming of me" - Speak and Spell

Light switch, man switch
Film was broken only then
All the night, fuse tomorrow
Dancing with a distant friend

Filming and screaming, I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming, dreaming of me

So we left, understanding
Clean cut, some were sounding fast
Talked of sad, I talked of war
I laughed and climbed the rising cast

Filming and screaming, I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming, dreaming of me

Quickly, I remember
Views that saw a face before
Timing, reason, understanding
Like Association Hall

Filming and screaming, I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming, dreaming of me


"Dressed In Black" - Black Celebration

She's dressed in black again
And I'm falling down again
Down to the floor again
I'm begging for more again
But oh what can you do
When she's dressed in black

My mind wanders endlessly
On paths where she's leading me
With games that she likes to play
And words that she doesn't say
Not when we're alone
And she's dressed in black

As a picture of herself
She's a picture of the world
A reflection of you
A reflection of me
And it's all there to see
If you only give in
To the fire within

Dressed in black again

Shadows fall onto me
As she stands there over me
And waits to encompass me
I lay here helplessly
But oh what can you do
When she's dressed in black

Dressed in black again


"Enjoy the Silence" - Violator

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
into my little world

Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Cant you understand
Oh my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence


"Everything Counts" - Construction Time Again

The handshake seals the contract
From the contract there's no turning back
The turning point of a career
In Korea being insincere
The holiday was fun-packed
The contract, still intact

The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves - after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves - after all
It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts

The graph on the wall
Tells the story of it all
Picture it now
See just how
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
Confidence - taken in
By a suntan and a grin

Everything counts in large amounts


"Flexible" - Catching Up With DM

Fame,
Can have strange effects
Money,
Can have strange effects

(Chorus) 
I ask myself
Is it a sin, to be inflexible
When the boat comes in 
Open the window and out go I.

Fame,
Can alter you
Girls,
Can have strange effects too

(Chorus)

We all know,
Fame don't last
We all know,
Cause I've asked

(Chorus to end)


"Fly On The Windscreen" - Black Celebration

Death is everywhere
There are flies on the windscreen
For a start
Reminding us
We could be torn apart
Tonight

Death is everywhere
There are lambs for the slaughter
Waiting to die
And I can sense
The hours slipping by
Tonight

Come here
Kiss me
Now
Come here
Kiss me
Now
Death is everywhere
The more I look 
The more I see
The more I feel
A sense of urgency
Tonight

Come here
Kiss me
Now
Come here
Kiss me
Now

There are flies on the windscreen
There are lambs for the slaughter
There are flies on the windscreen

Come here
Touch me
Kiss me
Touch me
Now
Touch me
Touch me


"Get The Balance Right" - People Are People

There's more besides the joyrides
Little house in the countryside
Understand, learn to demand
Compromise, and  sometimes lie

Get the balance right 
Get the balance right

Be responsible, respectable
Stable but gullible
Concerned and caring
Help the helpless
But always remain 
Ultimately selfish

Get the balance right
Get the balance right

You think you've got a hold of it all
You haven't got a hold at all
When you reach the top, 
Get ready to drop
Prepare yourself for the fall
(The fall)
It's almost predictable
(Almost)

Don't tend this way
Don't tend that way
Straight down the middle until next Thursday
First to the left
Back to the right
Twist and turn `till you got it right

Get the balance right (4x)


"Halo" - Violator 

You wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse

I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head it's worse

There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free

Can't you see
All love's luxuries
Are here for you an me

And when our worlds
They fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

And when our worlds
They fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it.


Happiest Girl" - Released on Single

Happiest girl I ever knew,
Happiest girl I ever knew
Wanted to feel the joy, 
Flow between our lips
Wanted to feel the joy, 
Flow between our hips
Happiest girl I ever knew, 
Why do you smile the smile you do
Happiest girl I ever knew, 
Happiest girl I ever knew
Wanted to feel the joy, 
Pass between our eyes
Wanted to feel the joy, 
Pass between our thighs
And I would have to pinch her, 
Just to see that she was real
Just to watch the smile fade away, 
See the pain she'd feel
Happiest girl I ever knew, 
Happiest girl I ever knew
Wanted to feel her joy, 
Feel it deep within
Wanted to feel her joy, 
Penetrate my skin
Happiest girl I ever knew, 
Why do you smile the smile you do


"Here Is The House" - Black Celebration

Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here
In this house

And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And there's someone
Calling on the telephone
Let's stay home
It's cold outside
And I have so much
To confide in you

With or without words
I'll confide everything

Here is the house 
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here 
In this house

So we stay at home
And I'm by your side
And you know
What's going on in side
Inside my hear
Inside this house
And I just want to
Let it out for you

And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home

Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together


"I Want You Now" - Music For The Masses 

I want you now
Tomorrow won't do
There's a yearning inside
And it's showing through
Reach out your hands
And accept my love
We've waited for too long
Enough is enough
I want you now

My heart is aching
My body is burning
My hands are shaking
My head is turning
You understand
It's so easy to choose
We've got time to kill
We've got nothing to lose
I want you now

And I don't mean to sound
Like one of the boys
That's not what I'm trying to do
I don't want to be
Like one of the boys
I just want you now

Because I've got a love
A love that won't wait
A love that is growing
And it's getting late
Do you know what it means
To be left this way
When everyone's gone
And the feelings they stay
I want you now


"Ice Machine" - Released on Single

Running through my head secretly
The shout of the boys in the factory
I'm ringing on the telephone silently
Like blood, like wine in the darkroom see
darkroom see
darkroom see

A letter once composed
Seven years long
And as tall as a tree
Reading on the wall efficient
efficiency
efficiency

Resurrect, as a feeling, on my window,
Of a past reunion
Resurrect as a feeling on my window 
Of a past reunion
Mission of a picture like the city and the air we 
breathe
the air we breathe
air we breathe

She stood beside me once again
I knew her face
We met before in the street
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet
their dancing feet
dancing feet


"If You Want" - Some Great Reward 

Working week's come to its end
Party time is here again
Everyone can come if they want to
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
You can come with me if you want

Exercise your basic right
We could build a building site
From the bricks of shame is built the hope
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
Even though you may still not want to

Let tomorrow and today
Bring a life of ecstasy
Wipe away your tears of confusion
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
You can come with me if you want to
Even though you still may not want to


"It Doesn't Matter" - Some Great Reward 

I am happy
That I have you
Even though you're not here now
I know somewhere
You are dreaming
Though it's definitely not of me

It doesn't matter
If this all shatters
Nothing lasts forever
But I'm praying
That we're staying
Together

I am warmed
By your friendship
Even when you're far away
And I'm happy
In the knowledge
We may never see the day
When I kiss you
And you kiss me
Don't pretend you miss me
The worst kind
Of diseased mind
Is one filled with jealousy

If we should meet again
Don't try to solve the puzzle
Just lay down next to me
And please don't move a muscle

I will thank you
Most of all for
The respect you have for me
I'm embarrassed
It overwhelms me
Because I don't deserve any


"It Doesn't Matter Two" - Black Celebration 

As I lay here with you
The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesn't matter

Though we may be the last in the world
We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears
To one another

And oh what a feeling
Inside of me
It might last for an hour
Wounds aren't healing 
Inside of me
Though it feels good now
I know it's only for now

The feeling is intense
You grip me with your eyes
And then I realize 
It doesn't matter


"Its Called a Heart" - Catching Up With DM

(Chorus) 
There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart
You know how easy it is, 
to tear it apart
If I lend it to you
Will you keep it safe for me
And if I lend it to you
If you treat it tenderly
There's something beating here inside my body and it's called a heart

There is a sun shining in the sky
But that's not the reason why
I'm feeling warm inside
The answer isn't classified
Its my heart
From the moment I started
I tried to be good hearted
Since I tried my best
And more or less
I spoke with my heart
There's a lot to learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

(Chorus)

Hearts can never be owned
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back
I will take it back
I'll take my heart
But I will try my best
And more or less
I'll speak from my heart
Yes I will speak from my heart
(Speak from my heart)
There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned
There's a lot to be learned
And you learn when your heart gets burned

(Chorus to end)


"Just Can't Get Enough" - Speak and Spell 
(Schizomix)

When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

Everything you did to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of...

We walk together
Walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Every time I thing of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

It's getting harder, it's a burning love
and I just can't seem to get enough of...

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of...


"Leave in Silence" - A Broken Frame

I've told myself so many times before
But this time I think I mean it for sure,
We have reached a full stop,
Nothing's going to save us from the big drop.

Reached our natural conclusion,
Outlived the illusion,
I hate being in these situations
That call for diplomatic relations.
If I only knew the answer,
Or I thought we had a chance,
Or I could stop this,
I would stop this thing
From spreading like a cancer.

(Chorus)
What can I say,
I don't want to play any more.
What can I say,
I'm heading for the door.
I can't stand this emotional violence.
Leave in silence.
Leave in silence.

We've been running round in circles all year,
Doing this and that and getting nowhere.
This will be the last time,
I think I said that last time.

If I only had a potion,
Some magical lotion,
I could stop this,
That could stop this,
I could set the wheels in motion.

(Chorus)


"Lie to Me" - Some Great Reward 

Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one

Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Don't mean a lot now
Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive
So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen
Just for a minute
Make me think
There's some truth in it

Promises made for convenience
Aren't necessarily
What we need
Truth is a word
That's lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth
So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think
That at the end of the day
Some great reward
Will be coming my way


"Little 15" - Music For The Masses

Little 15
You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while
Little 15

Little 15
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth
It's already more than enough
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And its little intrigues
Do you understand
Do you know what she means
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she's seen
You will
Little 15

Little 15
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is 3 little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
Little 15


"Love, In Itself" - Construction Time Again

All of these insurmountable tasks
That lay before me
All of the firsts
And the definite lasts
That lay in store for me

(Chorus)
There was a time
When all on my mind was love
Now I find
That most of the time
Love's not enough
In itself

Consequently
I've a tendency
To be unhappy, you see
The thoughts in my head
All the words that were said
All the blues and the reds
Get to me

(Chorus)

All of these absurdities
That lay before us
All of the doubts
And the certainties
That lay in store for us

(Chorus)


"Master And Servant" - Some Great Reward 

There's a new game
We like to play you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog
Get me down on my knees

We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant

It's a lot like life
This play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality

We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant

It's a lot like life
And that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one

Domination's the name of the game
In bed or in life
They're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled
At the end of the day

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

Let's play master and servant
come on master and servant


"Monument" - A Broken Frame

When the site was found
We laid the foundations down.
It didn't take long before
They came back tumbling down.
Don't build at night
You need a little light.
How else you going to see
What it is going to be like!
So we picked up our tools
And we worked in the morning light,
With the last stone placed
Wasn't it a wonderful sight,
But it fell back down
And scattered all around,
Anything passes
When you need glasses!

My Monument -- it fell down (4x)

Work all of my days for this kind of praise,
It fell down
Work all of my days -- it fell down.


"More Than A Party" - Construction Time Again

Lots of surprises in store
This isn't a party
It's a whole lot more

We've had enough of this blind man's bluff
You've kept us in the dark for long enough

(Chorus)
This is more than a party
More than a party
More than a party

Keep telling us we're to have fun
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none

(Chorus)

The failed magician waves his wand
And in an instant the laughter's gone

(Chorus)

Lots of surprises in store
This isn't a party
It's a whole lot more

(Chorus)


"My Secret Garden" - A Broken Frame

My Secret Garden's not so secret anymore!
Run from the house, holding my head in my 
hands,
Feeling dejected, feeling like a child might feel,
It all seems so absurd,
That this should have occurred,
My very only secret
And I had to go and leak it!
My Secret Garden's not so secret anymore!

No, my Secret Garden's not so secret anymore!
Run through the fields, down to the edge of the 
water,
Can't stay long, Here comes the reason why --
She'll catch me if she can,
Take me by the hand,
I'll have to keep on running
And I just can't see the fun in
My Secret Garden not being secret anymore!

It used to be so easy
On days such as these she'd
Search and search for hours
In among the flowers.
I loved it! -- I loved her!
Play the fool, act so cruel -- I loved it!
Read her book, take a look -- I loved her!
Play the fool, act so cruel -- I loved it!
Read her book, take a look -- I loved her!

It all seems so absurd, 
That this should have occurred,
My very only secret
And I had to go and leak it!
My Secret Garden's not so secret anymore.

"Never Let Me Down Again" - Music For The Masses 

I'm taking a ride
With my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he's taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride
With my best friend

We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground

I'm taking a ride 
With my best friend
i hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm as safe as houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again

Never let me down

See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight


"New Dress" - Black Celebration

Sex jibe husband murders wife
Bomb blast victim fights for life

Jet airliner shot from sky
Famine horror, millions die
Earthquake terror figures rise

You can't change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You can change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world

In black townships fires blaze
Prospects better premier says
Within sight are golden days

"New Life"- Speak and Spell

I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watch that man to a stranger
You think you only know when you turn on the 
light
Now the room is lit, red danger

Complicating, circulating
New Life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life

Transitions to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Your features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen now show me

Complicating, circulating
New Life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life

Your face is hidden and we're out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
A stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answers nowhere

Complicating, circulating
New Life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life

I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watch that man to a stranger
You think you only know when you turn on the 
light
Now the room is lit, red danger

Complicating, circulating
New Life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life


"Nodisco" - Speak and Spell

I saw you in the picture
I saw you play the part
This ain't nodisco
There's a thousand watching you
You take this to far
This ain't nodisco

Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance
Move me disco, baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco

Part one act on
Everyone pretend
This ain't nodisco
This is more a story
And we're reaching the end
This ain't nodisco

Always makes me happy when you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance
Move me disco, baby don't you let go 
Move me disco, baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco

I saw you in the picture
I saw you play the part

"Nothing" - Music For The Masses

Sitting target
Sitting waiting
Anticipating
Nothing, Nothing

Life
Is full of surprises
It advertises
Nothing, Nothing

What am I trying to do
What am I trying to say
I'm not trying to tell you anything
You didn't know

Sitting target
Sitting praying
God is saying
Nothing, Nothing

Always
Knows the prospects
Learn to expect

"Now This is Fun" - People Are People

Here speaks
The voice of reason
It's talking to me
Loud and clearly
And obviously
It's something to say
Here it comes
Another sentence
It is relentless
It tries my patience
But nevertheless
It's for our good turn

We can see the benefits
So we'll ignore it
Or disobey it
And then we'll say that

This is Fun
This is real fun
This is real fun
This is real fun
This is fun


"People Are People" - Some Great Reward 

People are people
So why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully

So we're different colors
And we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you so what could I have done

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

Help me understand

Now you're punching
And you're kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fists


"Personal Jesus" - Violator 

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Reach out and touch faith


"Photographic" - Speak and Spell

The white house, the white room
The program of today
The light on switch on
Your eyes ar far away
The map represents you
And the tape is your voice
Follow all along you
Till you recognize the choice

I take pictures
Photographic pictures
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room

I said I'd write a letter
But I never got the time
And looking to the day
I mesmerize the light
The years I spend just thinking
Of a moment we both knew
A second passed like an empty room
It seems it can't be true

I take pictures
Photographic pictures
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room

I take pictures
Photographic pictures
Bright light, dark room

"Pipeline" - Construction Time Again

Get out the crane
Construction time again
What is it this time
We're laying a pipeline

Let the beads of sweat flow
Until the ends have met though
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy

On this golden day
Work's been sent our way
That could last a lifetime
Working on the pipeline

From the heart of our land
To the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime
We're laying a pipeline

Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy


"Pleasure, Little Treasure" - Music For The Masses 

Everybody's looking for someone to follow
Finding the whole thing hard to swallow
Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason I've got a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's talking about the state of the nation
Everybody's searching for a promised land
Everybody's failing to understand
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason
I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure

Maternity frocks and paternity suits
If that what you want
They're waiting for you
Everybody needs some reason or other
You'll find a reason when you discover
Pleasure, little treasure

Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason
I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure


"Policy of Truth" - Violator

You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilized
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
 
Now you're standing there tongue tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell
 
You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth
 
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
Never again
Is what you swore
The time before
 
 
"Puppets"- Speak and Spell
 
Oh that feeling, head is reeling
You think you're in control but you don't know me babe
 
I can move you I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way
And I don't think you understand
What I'm trying to say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
 
Watch your action, close reaction
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head
 
Conversation my creation
Nothing that you do you do unless I said
And you don't know the consequences
Of the things you say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
 
All the things you tried to do babe
And all the words we've said before
Are only part of what I started baby
And you can't stop me anymore
 
Oh that feeling, head is reeling
You think you're in control but you don't know me babe
 
I can move you I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way
And I don't think you understand
what I'm trying to say
I'd be your operator baby
I'm in control


"Sacred" - Music For The Masses

Sacred
Holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
But it's my duty
I'm a missionary

So here is my confession
It's an obsession
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I've made my decision
This is religion
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

Spreading the news around the world
Taking the word to boys and girls
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I will go down on my knees
When I see beauty
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

Sacred
Holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground


"Satellite" - A Broken Frame 

Now hear this my friends,
I'll never be the same again,

Going to lock myself in a cold black room
Going to shadow myself in a veil of gloom,

(Chorus 2x)
I will function, operate,
I will be a satellite of hate.

Driven to this point by a chain of events,
Each one pushed me nearer the edge.
Going to send my message through to you,
You'll receive the signal too.

(Chorus 2x)

Higher, Higher
Disillusioned -- I was disenchanted,
Forgot the love that had been implanted,
Heard the lies and I felt the cold,
It broke my heard and I lost control --

Now I'm a satellite of a free state,
I'm a satellite of hate.
(Repeat Verse)


"See You" - A Broken Frame

All I want to do is see you again.
Is that too much to ask for?
I just want to see your sweet smile,
Smiled the way it was before.
Well I'll try not to hold you
And I'll try not to kiss you.
And I won't even touch you.

(Chorus)
All I wand to do is see you
Don't you know that it's true.

I remember the days when we walked through the woods,
We'd sit on a bench for a while.
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play
And look in each other's eyes.
You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance.
But I swear I won't touch you.

(Chorus)

Well I know five years is a long time and that times change
But I think that you'll find that people are basically the same.

If the water's still flowing we can go for a swim
And do the things we used to do.
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in,
We can relive our youth.

But we'll just stay friendly like sister and brother
Though I think I still love you.

(Chorus 2x)

All I want to do is (See You)

"Shake The Disease" - Catching Up With DM

I'm not going down on my knees
Begging you to adore me
Can't you see it's misery
And torture for me?
When I'm misunderstood
Try as hard as you can
I've tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me

(Chorus)
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me 
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold  of my tongue in situations like these
Understand me
Understand me
Understand me
Understand me

Some people have to be
Permanently together
Lovers devoted
To each other forever
Now I got things to do
And I've said before
That I know you have to
When I'm not there
In spirit I'll be there

(Chorus 2x)


"Shame" - Construction Time Again

Do you ever get that feeling
When the guilt begins to hurt
Seeing all the children
Wallowing in dirt
Crying out with hunger
Crying out in pain
At least the dirt will wash off
When it starts to rain

Soap won't wash away your shame

Do you ever get the feeling
That something isn't right
Seeing your brother's fists
Clenched ready for the fight
Soon the fighting turns to weapons
And the weapons turn to wounds
So the doctors stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch

Surgery won't improve your pain

It all seems so stupid
It makes me want to give up
But why should I give up
When it all seems so stupid

Do you ever get the feeling
That something can be done
To eradicate these problems
And make the people one
Do you ever get that feeling
Something like a nagging itch
And all the while the doctors
Stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch

Hope alone won't remove the stains

Shame


"Shouldn't Have Done That" - A Broken Frame

Plans made in the nursery
Can change the course of history,
Remember that!

Mummy's annoyed, says go out and play,
Don't show your face.
Stay away all day,
Shouldn't have done that!

A small boy and his infantry,
Marching around so naturally,
Shouldn't have done that!

Grows up and goes to school,
Such a nice boy, obeys all the rules,
Mummy's proud of that.
Leaves school to follow his ambition,
Knows what he wants,
To be a politician,
Shouldn't have done that!


"Shout"- Released on Single

She was silent trying to be like the girl who acted on the tv
Always knowing what to say
Wishing for a moment so that they could see
Staring in the night picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines

Breakaway tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We got to get it right
We got to understand

Kept me watching waiting as I stood amongst the 
back streets
And we start to play
I was screaming louder as the curtains fall between us
In a twisted way
Staring in the night picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines

Breakaway tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We got to get it right
We got to understand

Facing all the questions in the minutes of the games
We played so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful a radio transmission
That I have to know
You could never run you could never stay
And I think you belong to me

Breakaway tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We got to get it right
We got to understand

Breakaway tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We got to get it right
We got to understand


"Somebody" - Some Great Reward 

I want somebody to share
Share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts
Know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side
And give me support
And in return
She'll get my support
She will listen to me
When I want to speak
About the world we live in
And life in general
Though my views may be wrong
They may even be perverted
She will hear me out
And won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking
In fact she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all
She will understand me

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear
Of those things
But when I'm asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
I'll get away with it


"Something To Do" - Some Great Reward 

My little girl
Won't you come with me
Come with me
Tell me

Is there something to do (4x)

I'm going crazy with boredom
Come with me
Tell me

Is there something to do (4x)

Grey sky over a black town
I can feel depression
All around
You've got your leather boots on

Is there something to do (4x)

I can't stand another drink
It's surprising this town
Doesn't sink
You've got your leather boots on

Is there something to do (4x)

Your pretty dress is oil stained
From working to hard
For too little
You've got your leather boots on

s there something to do (4x)

You're feeling the boredom too
I'd gladly go with you
I'd put your leather boots on
I'd put your pretty dress on

Is there something to do (4x)


"Sometimes" - Black Celebration

Sometimes
Only sometimes
I question everything
And I'm the first to admit
If you catch me in a mood like this
I can be tiring

Even embarrassing
But you must
Feel the same
When you look around
You can't tell me honestly
You're happy with what you see
Oh sometimes
Only sometimes
You must be...
You must be...
As embarrassing as me
Sometimes


"Stories Of Old" - Some Great Reward 

Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect

You hear stories of old
Of princes bold
With riches untold
Happy souls
Casting it all aside
To take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams
At their side
But not me
I couldn't do that
Not Me
I'm not like that

I couldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love

I really like you
I'm attracted to you
The way you move
The things you do
I'll probably burn in hell
For saying this
But I'm really in heaven
Whenever we kiss
But Oh no!
You won't change me
You can try
For an eternity

I wouldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
to love

Now I've got things to do
You have too
And I've got to be me
You've got to be you
So take my hand
And feel these lips
And let's savor a kiss
Like we'd savor a sip
Of vintage wine
One more time
Let's surrender
To this love devine

But we won't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love


"Strangelove" - Music For The Masses

There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another river full
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it

There'll be days
When I'll stray
I may appear to be
Constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say
I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile

Pain will you return it
I'll say it again - pain
Pain will you return it
I won't say it again

I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to me
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in

I give in
Again and again
I give in
That's how my love goes
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in


"Stripped" - Black Celebration 

Come with me
Into the trees
We'll lay on the grass
And let the hours pass

Take my hand
Come back to the land
Let's get away
Just for one day

Let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone

Metropolis
Has nothing on this
You're breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss

Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everything's ours
For a few hours

Let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone

Let me hear you
Make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me

Let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone

Let me hear you speaking
Just for me

Let me see you 
Stripped down to the bone

Let me hear you crying
Just for me


"The Landscape is Changing" - Construction Time Again

The landscape is changing
The landscape is crying
Thousands of acres of forest are dying
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside

(Chorus)
`Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere
Just take good care of the world
I don't care if you're going nowhere
Just take good care of the world

Now we're re-arranging
There's no use denying
Mountains and valleys, 
Can't you hear them sighing
Evolution, 
the solution or the certainty
Can you imagine this intrusions of their privacy

(Chorus)

Token gestures, some semblance of intelligence
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance?

(Chorus)


"The Meaning of Love" - A Broken Frame

I've read more than a hundred books,
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times,
But despite all the places I've looked,
It's still no clearer,
It's just not enough,
I'm still no nearer

The meaning of love (3x)

Noted down all my observations
Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above,
But what's the meaning

The meaning of love (Tell me). 
(Repeat)

From the notes that I've made so far,
Love seems something like wanting a scar,
But I could be wrong,
I'm just not sure you see,
I've never been in love before
Next I asked several friends of mine,
If they could spare a few minutes of their time,
Their looks suggested that I'd lost my mind,
Tell me the answer
My Lord high above
Tell me the meaning,

The meaning of love (Tell me). 
(Repeat)

From the notes that I've made so far,
Love seems something like wanting a scar,
But I could be wrong,
I'm just not sure you see,
I've never been in love before

The meaning of love (Tell me)
(Repeat to end)


"The Sun & The Rainfall" - A Broken Frame

Someone will call,
Something will fall
And smash on the floor.
Without reading the text,
Know what comes next.
Seen it before
And it's painful.

(Chorus)
Things must change.
We must re-arrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them.
All that I'm saying 
A game's not worth playing
Over and over again.

You're the one I like best,
You retain my interest,
You're the only one.
If it wasn't for you,
Don't know what I'd do.
Unpredictable like the sun
And the rainfall.

(Chorus)


"The Sweetest Perfection" - Violator

The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind

I stop and I stare too much
Afraid that I care to much
And that I hardly dare to touch
For fear the spell may be broken

When I need a drug in me
And it brings out the thug in me
Feel something tugging me
Then I want the real thing not tokens

The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind

Things you'd expect to be
Having effect on me
Pass undetectedly
But everyone knows what has got me
Takes me completely
Touches so sweetly
Reaches so deeply
I know that nothing can stop me

Sweetest perfection
An offer was made
An assorted collection
But I wouldn't trade

The sweetest perfection
To call my own
The slightest correction
Couldn't finely hone
The sweetest infection
Of body and mind
Sweetest injection
Of any kind

Takes me completely
Touches so sweetly
Reaches so deeply
Nothing can stop me.


"The Things You Said" - Music For The Masses

I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
But they know me better than that
They know me better than that
They know my weaknesses
(I never tried to hide them)
They know my weaknesses
(I never denied them)

I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
How can a view become so twisted
How can a view become so twisted
They know my weaknesses
(I never tried to hide them)
They know my weaknesses
(You tried them)

I get so carried away
You brought me down to earth
I thought we had something precious
Now I know what it's worth

I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I heard it from my friends
About the things you said
I've never felt so disappointed
Never felt so disappointed
They know my weaknesses
I never tried to hide them
They know my weaknesses
Thought that you liked them

They know me better than that


"To Have And To Hold" - Music For The Masses 

I need to be cleansed
It's time to make amends
For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
I'm down on my knees
And I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away
And somewhere
There's someone who cares
With a heart of gold
To have and to hold


"Told You So" - Construction Time Again

And do these feet in modern times
Walk upon the flowers
And walk upon their brothers
While the heads are busy lying low
Trying to keep cover... oh

(Chorus)
Something went wrong
Along the way
Everybody's waiting for
Judgement day
So they can go
Told you so

Bring me my gun of itching desire
Bring me my bullets and I will fire
Sights set higher than the tall church spire

(Chorus)

Standing in line
The blind lead the blind
Waiting and waiting
For an overdue sign
Brothers and sisters
Playing Chinese whispers
If things aren't suited
Then they'll get diluted

There's one more dead with a hole in his head
He shouldn't have said all the things he said
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled
(Chorus)


"Tora! Tora! Tora!" -Speak and Spell

They were raining from the sky
Exploding in my hart
Is this the love in disguise
Or just a form of modern art

From the sky you can almost hear them cry
Tora! Tora! Tora!
In the town they were going down
Tora! Tora! Tora!

I had a nightmare only yesterday
You played the skeleton
You took my love than died that day
I played I'm an American

From the sky you can almost hear them cry
Tora! Tora! Tora!
In the town they were going down
Tora! Tora! Tora!

I played I'm an American
(I played I'm an American)

(Repeat to end)


"Two Minute Warning" - Construction Time Again

We're lying by the orange sky
Two million miles across the land
Scattered to the highest high
Expect they'll either laugh or cry
No sex, no consequence, no sympathy
You're good enough to eat

Two minute warning
Two minutes later
When time has come
My days are numbered

The dawning of another year
Marks time for those who understand
One in four still here
While you and I go hand in hand
No radio, no sound, no sin, no sanctuary
So welcome to your last

The sun, the solitude, the cemetery
So welcome to your last.


"Waiting for the Night" - Violator 

I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel
Is tranquillity

There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon

I'm waiting for the night to fall
I know that it will save us all
When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel
Is tranquillity

There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear

And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better
Than when they were open

Been waiting for the night to fall
I knew that it would save us all
Now everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality

Been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable
And here in the still
All that you feel
Is tranquillity.


"What's your name" - Speak and Spell

Sometimes watch you walk the street at midnight
Sometimes I can feel you in the air
Looking good knew you would
All the time I understood

Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
You're so pretty

Everybody seems to look your way now
Everybody wants to know your name
(hey hey, what's your name)
Feeling bright just tonight
Hear them say you're out of sight

Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
You're so pretty

All the boys we got to get together
All the boys together we can stand
We can go never know
All the things we need to show
Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
You're so pretty

Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
You're so pretty

P R E double T Y

Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
Hey you're such a pretty boy
You're so pretty


"Work Hard" - People Are People

You got to work hard, you got to work hard
If you want anything at all
You got to work hard, you got to work hard
If you want anything at all
Nothing comes easy
But that's a fact
Nothing comes easy
But a broken back

You got to work hard, you got to work hard (5x)

If you want anything at all
You got to work hard, you got to work hard
If you want any thing at all
Nothing comes easy
It never will
Nothing comes easy
But a broken will

You got to work hard, you got to work hard (5x)

If you want anything at all
You got to work hard, you got to work hard
If you want anything at all

You got to work hard
You got to work hard
You got to work hard
So work hard!
(Repeat Verse 3x)


"World Full Of Nothing" - Black Celebration

Close
Naked
Skin on skin
Tears are falling
Tears of joy
her first boy
His first girl
Makes a change

In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love
It means something

She's lonely
And he says
It's for her only 
That he lusts
She doesn't trust him
Nothing is true
But he will do

In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love
it means something

It's easy to slip away
And believe it all

Though it's not love
it means something


"World In My Eyes" - Violator

Let me take you on a trip,
Around the world and back,
And you won't have to move.
You just sit still.

Now let your mind do the walking,
And let my body do the talking.
Let me show you the world in my eyes.
I'll take you to the highest mountain,
To the depths of the deepest sea.
We won't need a map, believe me.

Now let my body do the moving, 
And let my hands do the soothing.
Let me show you the world in my eyes.
That's all there is,
Nothing more than you can feel now.
That's all there is.

Let me put you on a ship, 
On a long, long trip, 
Your lips close to my lips.
All the islands in the ocean, 
All the heaven's in the motion.

That's all there is, 
Nothing more than you can touch now.
That's all there is.
Let me show you the world in my eyes.
