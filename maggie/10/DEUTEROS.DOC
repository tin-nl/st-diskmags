
 DEUTEROS

The next Millennium

by Activision

„A game review done by Slime on 23.06.1992


As the name tells you, this is the follower of 'Millennium' coming 
on 2 disks.
After a short loading time, you have the 'honour' to see a f*cking 
text, giving you the credits. They used the system charset in Italic 
mode for the Deuteros logo - what a shame! After a short time the 
screen fades out and an ugly 'explosion' proclaims the intro. 
„Goddamn you! What's that? Now you have to bear what I simple call 
CRAP! The sound is a crime, the graphics a torture, and the effects 
are soooo booooring - you can't imagine if you haven't seen it! 
This is unbelievable..... If the game continues in the same style 
then this review will be pure slagging! We'll see.....

So I press 'Space' and wait that I exit the socalled intro, BUT.....
nothing happens! You have to press the mouse button! Stay calm Slime 
- perhaps the game isn't that bad.......
So I smash wildly on the mouse button and a little (system font) 
'Please wait' appears --> loading.....

One minute later you have the choice between three languages as 
there are:
1. English
2. Francais
3. Deutsch

As I'm a WEST-German I press '3'.... The screen fades out and now I 
have to replace Disk 1 with Disk 2. Done it --> loading.....

Some seconds later, I'm surprised!
The game graphics look much better as the intro graphics. It is well 
done and not entangling. The whole game is controlled by mouse and 
this control was done quite good - it's easy and simple, even you 
can understand it in a few seconds! Hehehehe!!!
The only negative thing is that the sound seems to be completely 
'ripped' from 'Millennium' and that's annoying because it was and 
still is shite!

Well, Deuteros is an interesting game with sometimes slow-moving 
action. Hours for hours you'll do nothing else then supervising 
your spacecrafts - boring like hell! This hinders the game action a 
lot.

Concluding, I have to say that all the guys who liked 'Millennium' 
will get a real fantastic follower, but all the people who hated it, 
better don't load it!
