
Welcome to MAGGIE Issue 10!


This is the third issue with this whole new style of user 
interface. We got several positive reactions, so it seems all you 
dear readers have accepted it.
Nevertheless we want to go on with improving this magazine. So 
all you people out there, please write and give us some 
suggestions how we can make this magazine even better.

Note, we have removed the "PD-List" button and added a new button 
called "Adult only". The articles in this new corner are really 
adult only, so watch your children. Some people will call us 
perverts now, but we never intended to make a magazine just for 
15 year old kids. Just don't even click on this button if you 
don't agree with us.

Note to all PD libraries : This magazine is copyrighted software. 
It may be copied freely, but it is not allowed to charge any 
money for it, regardless how small the amount is. If you still 
want to sell it, contact us and we'll see what we can do.

Also coming from the next issue on : ADVERTS. 
You can have your own advert in one of the next issues. You can 
simply write whatever you want to, sell things, ask for 
guestscreens, give greetings, announce news, etc. etc.
You just have to do one thing : send us a disk with your advert 
on (ASCII or preferably WordPlus format, maximum columns : 70). 
We will include in the adverts section. What does it cost? - 
Nothing. We will just keep your disk since we cannot be bothered 
sending all disks back. And please don't send any piece of paper 
with your ad on, we won't type it in for you!

Another thing we want to do is to ask you for articles. We have a 
severe lack of good game/demo reviewers and we also need some 
more article writers. If you've got something to say, just load 
your WordPlus system (or any other ASCII editor) and write an 
article, send it to us and we'll include it. DO SOMETHING!!!

If there's enough interest, we would like to have a NEWS corner 
where all scene people can tell any news they got. For example : 
group xxx writes a new demo called yyy. AAA got kicked out off 
BBB and joined CCC. Write us all news about your group!


That's all, enjoy this issue
