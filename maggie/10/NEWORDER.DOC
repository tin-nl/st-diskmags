
NEW ORDER

Discography and some lyrics from their brilliant Substance album.

New Order is still one of the best electronic bands and I simply 
love their music.

In 1986 when I thought about my coding alias, I had two favourite 
bands : New Order and Depeche Mode. Now guess where I got my name 
from...

Every day my confusion grows...

                      You'd smile and salute me
                     If I told a different story
                  All the sinful wheels are turning
                Turning in and turn towards this time
                   All she asks is when to hold me
                    They gain the same old story
                     We traveled oh, so quickly
                Travel first to me, towards this time
              Oh, I'll bring them down, no mercy shown
                Heaven knows it's got to be this time
               What she'd heard, these things she said
           The time she cried and failed to wait this time
  
              Oh, I'll bring them down, no mercy shown
                Heaven knows it's got to be this time
                    Avenues, all lined with trees
               Picture me and then you start watching
                          Watching forever
                    Forever - watching love grow
                      Forever - letting me know
                               Forever
  
  
                       Everything's Gone Green
  
                      Help me, somebody help me
                         I wonder where I am
                      I see my future before me
                      I'll hurt you when I can
                 It seems like I've been here before
  
                  Confusion sprung up from devotion
                     A halo that covers my eyes
               It sprung from this first estrangement
                     No one have I ever despised
               Is this the way that you wanted to pay
              Won't you show me, please show me the way
               Is this the way that you wanted to pay
              Won't you show me, please show me the way
  
  
                             Temptation
  
                    A heaven I'd get with a hope
             Just like the feeling inside, it's no joke
            And though it hurts me to treat you this way
         Betrayed my words, I'd never heard, too hard to say
                        Up, down, turn around
                 Please don't let me hit the ground
                   Tonight I think I'll walk alone
                   I'll find my soul as I go home
  
               Each way I turn, I know I'll always try
          To break this circle that's been placed around me
            From time to time, I find I've lost some need
               That was urgent to myself, I do believe
                        Up, down, turn around
                 Please don't let me hit the ground
                   Tonight I think I'll walk alone
                   I'll find my soul as I go home
  
                      Oh, you've got green eyes
                      Oh, you've got blue eyes
                      Oh, you've got grey eyes
          And I've never seen anyone quite like you before
           No, I've never met anyone quite like you before
            Thoughts from above hit the people down below
            People in this world, we have no place to go
                       Oh, it's the last time
           Oh, I've never met anyone quite like you before
         Oh no, I've never met anyone quite like you before
  
  
                             Blue Monday
  
              How does it feel to treat me like you do?
                   When you've your hands upon me
                       And told me who you are
                      I thought I was mistaken
                    I thought I heard your words
                       Tell me, how do I feel
                     Tell me now, How do I feel
  
                      Those who came before me
                    Lived through their vocations
                   From the past until completion
                      They'll turn away no more
                     And I still find it so hard
                      To say what I need to say
               But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
                    Just how I should feel today
  
                     I see a ship in the harbor
                        I can and shall obey
                But if it wasn't for your misfortune
                   I'd be a heavenly person today
                    And I thought I was mistaken
                   And I thought I heard you speak
                        Tell me how do I feel
                   Tell me now, how should I feel
  
                     Now I stand here waiting...
                  I thought I told you to leave me
                  While I walked down to the beach
                      Tell me how does it feel
                     When your heart grows cold
  
  
                              Confusion
  
                             (W W W R L)
                      You just can't believe me
                 When I show you what you mean to me
                      You just can't believe me
                 When I show you what you cannot see
  
           You're hiding from feelings, searching for more
              Sharing and hoping, untouched for so long
          Our lives still change from the way that we were
       And now I'll tell you something I think you should know
                      You just can't believe me
                 When I show you what you mean to me
                      You just can't believe me
                 When I show you what you cannot see
  
            You cause me confusion, you told me you cared
           He's calling these changes that last to the end
             Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies
            The past is your present, the future is mine
                      You just can't believe me
                 When I show you what you mean to me
                      You just can't believe me
                 When I show you what you cannot see
  
           You tell me you need me, I'll make it this time
         The thread won't divide us, the sensation survives
        I was sure that I told you it was good from the face
        You've caused me some problems, you've taken my place
  
               Why can't you see what you mean to me?
  
  
                           Thieves like us
  
               I've watched your face for a long time
                        It's always the same
              I've studied the cracks and the wrinkles
                       You were always so vain
             Well, now you live your life like a shadow
                         In the pouring rain
                        Oh, it's called love
                        Yes, it's called love
                        Oh, it's called love
                        And it belongs to us
                       Oh, it dies so quickly
                         It grows so slowly
                 But when it dies, it dies for good
                          It's called love
                  And it belongs to everyone but us
  
                  I've lived my life in the valleys
                   I've lived my life on the hills
                    I've lived my life on alcohol
                     I've lived my life on pills
                        But it's called love
                        And it belongs to us
                          It's called love
           And it's the only thing that's worth living for
                          It's called love
                        And it belongs to us
                          It's called love
                        Yes it's called love
  
               Oh, love is found in the east and west
               But when love is at home, it's the best
                   Love is the cure for every evil
               Love is the air that supports the eagle
                          It's called love
                         And it's so un-cool
                          It's called love
                And somehow it's become unmentionable
                          It's called love
                  And it belongs to every one of us
                          It's called love
              And it cuts your life like a broken knife
  
  
                            Perfect Kiss
  
                    I stood there beside myself,
                   Thinking hard about the weather
                    Then came by a friend of mine
                    Suggested we go out together
                    Then I knew it from the start:
                This friend of mine would fall apart
                   Pretending not to see his guilt,
               I said "let's go out and have some fun"
           I know, you know, you believe in a land of love
           I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
  
                     I have always thought about
                     Staying here and going out
                Tonight I should have stayed at home,
                    Playing with my pleasure zone
                    He has always been so strange,
                  I'd often thought he was deranged
                   Pretending not to see his gun,
               I said "let's go out and have some fun"
           I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
           I know, you know, we believe in a land of love
  
                     When you are alone at night
               You search yourself for all the things
                     That you believe are right
                       If you give it all away
          You throw away your only chance to be here today
               Then a fight breaks out on your street
           You lose another broken heart in a land of meat
                 My friend, he took his final breath
          Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death 
  
  
                             Subculture
  
                     I like walking in the park
                     When it gets late at night
                      I move `round in the dark
                    And leave when it gets light
                         I sit around by day
                     Tied up in chains so tight
                      These crazy words of mine
                       So wrong they could be
                     What do I get out of this?
                     I always try, I always miss
            One of these days you'll go back to your home
              You won't even notice that you are alone
             One of these days when you sit by yourself
         You'll realise you can't show off without someone else
                     In the end you will submit
                    It's got to hurt a little bit
  
                     I like talking in my sleep
                      When people work so hard
                   They need what they can't keep
                  A choice that leaves them scarred
                        A room without a view
                      Unveils the truth so soon
                     And when the sun goes down
                      You've lost what you had
                     What do I get out of this?
                     I always try, I always miss
            One of these days you'll go back to your home
              You won't even notice that you are alone
             One of these days when you sit by yourself
         You'll realise you can't show off without someone else
                     In the end you will submit
                    It's got to hurt a little bit
  
  
                             Shellshock
  
                     That's the way - Shellshock
                     Hold on!  It's never enough
          It's never enough until your heart stops beating
              The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
        Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
  
           You call me on the phone, you left me all alone
                  All I get from you is shellshock
               Another day goes by and all I do is cry
                  All I get from you is shellshock
                 I'd tell the world and save my soul
                 But rain falls down and I feel cold
                 A cold that sleeps within my heart
                  It tears the earth and sun apart
                  But that's the way that I can win
                      A victim of your evil sin
                You've lost the hold you've had on me
              By causing the changes that you never see
                     Hold on!  It's never enough
          It's never enough until your heart stops beating
              The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
        Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
  
                 When we walk through open doorways,
                  Counting time in one or more ways
                   We can't find our peace of mind
                  And life becomes a life of crime
                 And that's the day I call your name
                   I came to you, I called in vain
                You lost the faith within your heart
           The fire in your soul from the end to the start
                     Hold on!  It's never enough
          It's never enough until your heart stops beating
              The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
        Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
  
                  I've been good and I've been bad
                   But common sense I've never had
                    No matter how I try and try,
                    I hide the truth behind a lie
                  But that's the way that I can win
                      A victim of your evil sin
                You lost the faith within your heart
           The fire in your soul from the end to the start
                     Hold on!  It's never enough
          It's never enough until your heart stops beating
              The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
        Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
  
  
                         State of the Nation
  
                    You can walk, or you can run
                    You don't have to be someone
                      I went on a summer cruise
                     Upon an ocean born to lose
                  My brother said that he was dead
                  I saw his face and shook my head
                    Can you see where we can't be
                  We're losing our blood in the sea
                 'Cause it's the state of the nation
                    That's holding our salvation
                  Yes, it's the state of the nation
                    That's holding our salvation
                     Oh, the state of the nation
                     Is causing death inflation
                     Oh, the state of the nation
                     Is causing death inflation
  
                     From my home I traveled far
                      I drove in my stolen car
               When it broke down, I kissed the ground
               'Cause I don't kiss when you're around
                    I don't find that I have been
                     The portrait of an only son
               If that's the case, then who could tell
                      Where my story had begun?
                 Cause it's the state of the nation
                    That's holding our salvation
                  Yes, it's the state of the nation
                    That's holding our salvation
                    Yes, the state of the nation
                   That's causing death inflation
                     Oh, the state of the nation
                   That's causing death inflation
  
                       Even now, I'm all alone
                 Behind a wall that's made of stone
                  I think about where we have been
                And all the sights that could be seen
                  I know it all could be worthwhile
                    If only I could force a smile
                  Now we turn our backs to the sea
                The shame of a nation we'll never be
                 Cause it's the state of the nation
                    That's holding our salvation
                  Yes, it's the state of the nation
                    That's holding our salvation
                     Oh, the state of the nation
                     Is causing death inflation
                    Yes, the state of the nation
                     Is causing death inflation
  
  
                        Bizarre Love Triangle
  
                      Every time i think of you
            I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
          It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
               Living a life that I can't leave behind
                   There's no sense in telling me
               The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
                   But that's the way that it goes
                     And it's what nobody knows
                 While every day my confusion grows
                    Every time I see you falling
                   I get down on my knees and pray
                  I'm waiting for that final moment
                You'll say the words that I can't say
  
                     I feel fine and I feel good
                   I'm feeling like I never should
       Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
          Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
                  I'm not sure what this could mean
                 I don't think you're what you seem
                        I do admit to myself
                     That if I hurt someone else
           Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
                    Every time I see you falling
                   I get down on my knees and pray
                  I'm waiting for that final moment
                You'll say the words that I can't say
  
  
                    True Faith (The Morning Sun)
  
                       I feel so extraordinary
                    Something's got a hold on me
                  I get this feeling I'm in motion
                      A sudden sense of liberty
                  I don't care 'cause I'm not there
                And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
                 Again and again I've taken too much
                Of the things that cost you too much
            I used to think that the day would never come
           I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
           My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
              To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
            I used to think that the day would never come
           That my life would depend on the morning sun...
  
                    When I was a very small boy,
                    Very small boys talked to me
                  Now that we've grown up together
                   They're afraid of what they see
                  That's the price that we all pay
              And the value of destiny comes to nothing
                 I can't tell you where we're going
              I guess there was just no way of knowing
            I used to think that the day would never come
           I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
           My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
              To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
            I used to think that the day would never come
           That my life would depend on the morning sun...
  
                       I feel so extraordinary
                    Something's got a hold on me
                  I get this feeling I'm in motion
                      A sudden sense of liberty
                 The chances are we've gone too far
               You took my time and you took my money
                 Now I fear you've left me standing
                   In a world that's so demanding
            I used to think that the day would never come
           I'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
           My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
              To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
            I used to think that the day would never come
           That my life would depend on the morning sun...
  
  
                          In a Lonely Place
  
                   Caressing the marble and stone
                    Love that was special for one
                  The waste and the fever and hate
                How I wish you were here with me now
  
                    The body that kills and hides
                      Matches an awful delight
                   One like a dog `round your feet
                How I wish you were here with me now
  
                The hangman looks `round as he waits
                Gullet stretches tight and it breaks
                 Someday we will die in your dreams
                How I wish we were here with you now
  
  
                             Procession
  
                       There is no end to this
                        I have seen your face
               But I don't recognize all these things
                      You must have kept behind
                      It's a problem, you know
                   That's been there all your life
             Tries to make you see the world without you
                  That's just some black and white
                      At night it gets cold and
                   You'd dearly like to turn away
                        An escape that fails
              And makes the wounds that time won't heal
                     Hello, hello, hello, hello
  
                       There is no end to this
                          I can't turn away
                    Another picture would deceive
                            History'd say
                      There is no room to move
                         Or try to look away
                      Remember, life is strange
              And life keeps getting stranger every day
                    A mass of harmless attitudes
                       All tied up all subside
                       No matter what they say
             You knew your heart beats you late at night
               Your heart beats you late at night (3)
  
  
                                Mesh
  
             Below the surface this day I need it light
               Inside dimension lies another sacrifice
       Once out of reach, we never speak, we never compromise
As they turned to gold the edges froze and seemed to turn to ice
             All flight departures assembled not returned
          Left in these passions I looked but never learned
      There's hope, you've heard there's life in another world
           Sometimes you'll find that truth is never kind
    In the ghost lies a portrait of space that time is never here
      In the mind of a fallen man, an easy day in another land
     Ship sails out to sea, away from me, I just stand and stare
  Assassin clears his hands, I know that, and, I wasn't even
there
        One day it came to mind we even leave the rest behind
            Some day, I know, you get where you should go
      There's hope, you've heard there's life in another world
            Sometimes we'll find that truth is never kind
        One day it came to mind we even leave the rest behind
          Some day, I know, we even get where we used to go
      There's hope, you've heard there's life in another world
  
  
                                Hurt
  
                       (One, two, three, four)
                I am for you can enjoy I can give you
                     (Give me, give me, give me)
             It's a time we love to hate, I can give you
  
               I am for you will enjoy I can give you
                     (Give me, give me, give me)
        This is the time you'd love to hate, I will take you
  
               I'm quite determined and there will be
                  No more mistakes, no more talking
                       I'll bet you hate this
  
             Oh, I am for you will enjoy, I can take you
                     (Give me, give me, give me)
                     This is the law and you...
  
               I'm quite determined and there will be
                 No more mistakes like the last one
  
  
                          Lonesome Tonight
  
                       I walk along the street
                        I look into your eyes
                      I'm pleasant when we meet
                     I'm there when you go home
                        How many times before
                    Could you tell I didn't care?
                   When you turned your back on me
                       I knew we'd get nowhere
                       Do you believe in youth
                      The history of all truth
                     A heart that's left at home
                      Becomes a heart of stone
  
                      Do you believe in truth?
                      The lies we told of youth
                       A cause we call our own
                       Beside an empty throne
                        How many times before
                    Could you tell I didn't care?
                 When you reached out in your sleep
                     And you knew I wasn't there
                      My eyes are made of stone
                     Just like your sordid home
                        How many times before
                    Did you leave my soul alone?
  
  
                               Murder
  
                  Crows, crows, crows, I hate them
                           Crawl across!
                      I wouldn't do that, Dave
                          I'm afraid, Dave
                          My mind is going
                    There is no question about it
  
  
                                1963
  
                        It was January, 1963
              When Johnny came home with a gift for me
           He said I bought it for you because I love you
       And I bought it for you because it's your birthday, too
              He was so very nice, he was so very kind
                To think of me at this point in time
             I used to think of him, he used think of me
                     He told me to close my eyes
                  My gift would be a great surprise
                    I saw tears were in his eyes
                      He never meant to hurt me
             Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
             There's so many ways our lives have changed
               But please, I beg, don't do this to me
                 Johnny, don't point that gun at me
                  Can I save my life at any price?
              For butter crunch will you listen to me?
  
          And though he was ashamed that he had took a life
                 Johnny came home with another wife
              And he often remembered how it used to be
                 Before that special occasion, 1963
         There was too many ways that you could kill someone
            Like in a love affair, when the love is gone
                     He told me to close my eyes
                  My gift would be a great surprise
                      I saw hatred in his eyes
                      He never meant to hurt me
             Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
             There's so many ways our lives have changed
               But please, I beg, don't do this to me
                    Johnny, you keep on using me
                 Can I change my life for any price?
                 Oh, Johnny, won't you listen to me?
  
                     He told me to close my eyes
                  My gift would be a great surprise
                      I saw hatred in his eyes
                    But he never meant to hurt me
             Oh, God, Johnny, don't point that gun at me
             There's so many ways our lives have changed
               But please, I beg, don't do this to me
                    Johnny, you keep on using me
                 Can I change my life for any price?
                 Oh, Johnny, won't you listen to me?
  
                     I just want you to be mine,
                  I don't want this world to shine
                  I don't want this bridge to burn
                     Oh, Johnny, do you miss me?
                     I just want to feel for you
                    I will always feel for you...
