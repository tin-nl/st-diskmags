
Interview with TPPI - A group from the United States


MAGGIE:  Tell us more about your group, ... Give us some brief 
information about each member in general (name, age, profession)

StratoHACKster: Paul Steffen, 21, Coding/Music/Gfx
                [in order of talent...d:^]
Whiplash: Dan Hollis, 19, Coding/Coding/Coding



MAGGIE: How's life for an american ST user?

Strato: Boring as shit!

Whiplash: Oh god. Pure SHIT! Even tho Atari's HQ are in the USA, 
you'd never know it! Support from Atari is really LAME! If you 
want anything for your Atari, you have to really dig around, 
it's quite hard to find!


MAGGIE: are there any other demo groups in the US working on ST?
 
Strato: None that I know of.

Whiplash: Not as far as I know. There are cracking groups, but 
they don't really crack anything, they get all their stuff pre-
cracked from europe! Pretty lame hu? TPPI is the only demo group 
in the US, and will probably be the only one to release a demo, 
EVER! BTW, we *don't* crack anything! :^)


MAGGIE: Tell us more about the scene in the states (all formats)

Strato: I don't know...  What's a scene?

Whiplash: Same shit as around the world. IBM dominates the 
market, followed by Mac, the Amiga, and finally the ST. Amiga 
got its hold in the USA because of its grafixx and sound, and 
unlike the ST, there *ARE* demo crews in the USA for the Amiga. 
Still, Atari has quite a strong hold in the MIDI market in the 
USA.


MAGGIE: What's your favourite demo?
 
Strato: Don't know.  They all suck!  Well...  As far as the ST 
goes, I've seen little from the scene but I was impressed with 
the Phaleon DigiDemo. Hardwired is the most crazy Amiga demo 
I've seen, yet.  

Whiplash: Hmmm.... without offending anyone, I'd have to say my 
fave demo is "Ooh crikey wot a scorcher" by The Lost Boys, 
closely followed by PYM, and then the recently released Phaleon 
gigademo.


MAGGIE: Your fave game?

Strato: Pinball Dreams from Amiga demo crew Silents is the best 
pinball game put on a computer I've seen.  Anything by Core 
Design [with members from even another, Anarchy] is also quite 
fucken good.

Whiplash: My fave game? Rainbow Islands of course! And New Mode 
is gonna hate me for saying it, but my 2nd fave game is Match-it 
(the game included on the Syntax Terror Demo).. *grin*


MAGGIE: The best demo group?
 
Strato: TPPI [we are lamers, aren't we!].  I think Phenomena is 
an excellent combination of coders, musicians, and artists.  
When you've got an artist at #1 [UNO], musicians at #1 and #2 
spots [Tip/Mantronix], and various coders floating around the 
top of charts, you can be cocky bastards.  ST groups should 
start putting more of a priority on tracker music even if it 
makes their machine run like a C64.

Whiplash: Mmm. The best demo group so far seems to be Delta 
Force, because DF has so many members! And also because it seems 
no other demo groups are producing any demos right now!


MAGGIE: Is it hard for you to get new productions since letters 
take a long time to the US?

Strato: Not really.  Our 3 members are within easy reach through 
a computer network but we are all lazy gits.  We really do our 
own thing right now.  I'm the only Amiga coder in the group 
although I'd like to eventually get back on the ST if I can get 
ST Internals back from that cheap bastard, Marxx!!

Whiplash: Haha, I don't need ST-Internals, I know every register 
by memory!! I get all the new productions on the Internet, which 
is usually faster than letters ;^) And as far as overseas 
letters taking a long time? That's not really true, I can send 
letters to Holland and they arrive in 5 days! That's usually 
faster than sending mail within the US!


MAGGIE:  Tell us more about your life, what are you doing apart 
from demos?

Strato: Shit!  What else is there?  Well, I play jazzy guitar 
and listen to Fusion (John Maclaughlin!).  I also watch very 
little television except for a show called Mystery Science 
Theatre 3000 ["Now this is good TV." -Jack Perkins].  I've never 
really had a regular job and don't have a drivers license 
(although, I've had a car for the past year..).

Whiplash: Paul you lamer! Get a fucken license! Well, I recently 
got lucky and I'm now working for a computer company. I've got 
access to lots of great hardware, one of which is an extremely 
tasty Motorola 88000 machine running X-windows and Unix. I'm 
also into collecting Japanamation (I hear Furyo of OVR likes 
Akira, I should meet him sometime and show him my tape 
collection) which is my big collecting thing now. Aside from 
that, I have little time to do anything else!


MAGGIE:  Have you ever coded any games?
 
Strato: My first ASM project was a Z80 game back in 4th grade on 
a TRS-80 [I've even got a signed copy of the Z80 manual!].  I 
later got a TI and did a asteroids game with mega sprites.  I've 
gotten lazy during high school.  It's very likely that TPPI will 
do some game programming when we get some time on our hands.  
I've had an idea for a vector game for a long time but I'd like 
to finish up some other things first.

Whiplash: I haven't coded any games myself, but I helped program 
a game called "Disciples of Steel" (on the Atari ST of course). 
But, I got ripped off! I'm currently fighting the publisher for 
payment, coz they are trying to hide the number of sales from 
me! Ripping programmers off seems to be a pretty common thing in 
the computer games market.


MAGGIE:  Any criticsm for Maggie?
 
Strato: How about adding a tracker player?  Most of the time, 
the computer is waiting for keypresses.  I think some mellow 
spacey music adds alot to disk mags..  I like the writings a bit 
more in ST News but Maggie's user interface is very fancy.  More 
tech talk!  Bore the fucking lamers!

Whiplash: Yeah, where are the 3-d vector graphixx and 
trackermusix? Also, where are the parallax scrollines, and sinus 
dots?? Wot, no starfield?


MAGGIE:  If you would get $10000 to buy a computer, what would 
you buy?

Strato: Either a loaded Falcon or a cheap SGI workstation.  
Depending on those sorry bastards at Atari.

Whiplash: $10,000? I'd prolly buy a NeXT! The graphical 
interface (NeXTstep) is absolutely wonderful, it runs Unix, and 
it has awesome graphics and sound! This is what I call a 
hacker's dream! If Atari gets their act together and doesn't 
fuck up with the Falcon, then THAT will be by next purchase 
however.


MAGGIE: What software are you using?

Strato: On the ST, I use Turbo Assembler and Devpac.  On the 
Amiga, I use Devpac, ASMone, Dpaint, Protracker, and some of my 
own tools.

Whiplash: TurboASM, Devpac, and ProTracker (by Karl 0ygard on 
the ST). BTW, Karl - send me ProTracker 2.0! I've been waiting 
forever to see it! Oh yeah, I also use CrackArt for grafixx.


MAGGIE: Will there ever be a copyparty in the states?

Strato: Yes!  Probably more then in any European country but 
they are usually just a bunch of fucking PC lamers.  Nothing big 
or 'official' like you have there, however.  Certainly nothing 
that involves demos.

Whiplash: Yeah, in fact there's going to be a massive copyparty 
at Stratohak's house tomorrow!.... NOT! There will probably 
never be a copyparty in the US, because who is going to come? I 
suppose we could invite groups from Europe, though. But it would 
be really expensive for everybody!


MAGGIE: What do you like/dislike about the Atari scene?

Strato: It's not as big as it should be here.

Whiplash: Correction Paul, it's almost nonexistent here.
 

MAGGIE: Now space for your personal stuff... add what you want...
 
Strato: Shit!  Well, TPPI is probably the only ST/Amiga coding 
team in the US.  We may even release or Controlled Substance 
demo before the next millenium.  I've been planning on a 
St/Amiga multibooter for some pic/music show disks and there was 
even talk of an ST/Amiga scene mag joint venture with semi-US 
Megawatts and some help from Celebrandil/Phenomena.  It's hard 
to say.  We might even start a trend here!

Whiplash: Hmm, the TPPI demo will probably be released September 
10th..... 1998! We've got a couple of interesting projects in 
work, one of them being a digital sound compressor (BTW Paul, 
send me the fucken code!!) and some other lame stuff. When the 
Falcon comes out, we'll probably drop everything we're doing and 
concentrate on coding for that...... NOT!
