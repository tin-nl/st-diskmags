 and lend us their soap????

„Dear Chris,
 This will either precede or post date a pile of books depending on 
the voracity of the Post office for its bonuses. I thought I would 
send you this short explanation of the IBM computer business. This 
could be the first of a series, tell me if you're interested..

(They both got there at the same time.... CIH..)
„
The scene, an alternative world on a planet with a bluer sun (too 
much hydrogen!) In front of you is a shop selling Atari ST's.

This ST is Mod-u-Lar and all the bits are available from more than 
one source, big shock, eh... And you have a choice of operating 
system, and all the bits connect to the other bits... By standard 
connectors!

Furthermore, you can upgrade the machine by changing any bit, 
semi-independantly of the rest. That means you can add almost any 
size of hard disc, almost any mouse, and have any screen 
resolution, even swap CPU's! So there we have this mega machine 
(Which can normally be expanded to 16 times its memory for about 
œ50.00 per meg..)

So why don't we all rush out and buy this machine, well... the 
thing is, that memory can be 64 megs, but the computer will only 
officially recognise the first 640k, the rest is accessible only 
if you use the certain routines on the latest processors...

The company that originally developed the machine makes Atari 
look like a kind uncle, that company (IBM) is bureaucratic, vast, 
definitely bent on corporate suicide, and most amazingly, 
consistently fails to deliver the goods.. Now how do you you know 
a customer wants his computer roasted in a certain way?? Easy, it 
is because the company allows virtually free competition, and it 
is thus possible to buy a machine that is significantly faster, 
sleeker, better made, and most importantly (Those who disagree 
with this list's direction - Shut up!!) Cheaper, how much less ?? 
Well, if there was the same competition in the Atari market, you 
could get two 'clones' for the price of one, and if you were 
prepared to sacrifice build quality, maybe even three or four for 
the price of the standard Atari offering!

Perhaps the biggest problem/blessing, is that you can specify your 
own machine (If your pockets are very deep..) to do virtually 
anything, from a basic humble number cruncher with a mono text 
only display , and no hard disk, say at œ300.00, to a super fast 
single processor machine with added CAD and maths co-processors, 
massive gigabyte storage, optical (Floptical to you techies,) 
disks and networking with CD-Rom, and a 20 inch colour monitor 
with multitasking and windows with hundreds of things happening in 
them, all in the same box, but it would then cost about œ20,000..

So there you have it, horses for courses, usually people live 
within their limitations because of either the cost of upgrading 
it, or the fact it is not possible to upgrade without junking it 
altogether... This explains the hordes of nasty glittery Spectrums 
which should have been killed off by the Trade Descriptions Acts 
attacks on the advertising of it's feeble games (predominantly 
programmed in blood red!) All Spectrum owners are asked to send 
letters only if they have express permission to complain from 
their keeper...

But there is that marvellous software base, I hear you cry, 
billions of games and programs and more utilities in PD than you 
can shake a stick at.. (Especially a stick with dubious personal 
hygiene..)

Well that is true as far as it goes, but it leads to a situation 
where the IBM computer is a defacto (Some would say a defecating) 
standard which allows companies to charge hype prices. A good 
wordprocessor costs between œ100 to œ400 depending on its 
complexity, and many PC packages come with more manuals than „God 
would have got, if he had bought the Earth as a kit..

A friend of mine recently bought a database development package 
for the PC and got 12" of manuals in close type. Most 
wordprocessors have manuals that really need a neat program to 
tell you where to look for anything..

(To corrupt a famous saying..)
„Big programs have big manuals,
To aid users and enlighten..
and these have smaller program aids,
and so on, ad-infinitum...

Now all you ST owners are saying to yourself, well I've got a 
fabulous computer and these PC's sound like a load of Peruvian 
Goats cheddar.. Well, no, the point is, that sooner or later you 
are going to get run over by the PC bandwagon, and you aren't 
going to be able to do a thing about it..

This will occur because of the following factors..

1. The PC has a huge range of software to build on, the complexity 
of the latest machines allows them to do anything faster with the 
same dull softfware..

2. The PC market is worldwide, and has fierce competition from the 
Japanese especially, who plow more and more money into research 
and development to improve the PC still further.. The world's 
first 'computer on a chip' (CPU, support chips and RAM..) will be 
a PC..

3. The PC is now evolving with an add-on O/S, better than the ST 
or Amiga, and for which a projected 95% of future software will be 
written for. This is Windows 3, maybe not perfect yet but in two 
years, you will nver have to look at a text prompt on a PC, unless 
you want to..

4. And lastly, there are more of us than you, we number hundreds 
of millions and within three years, will be able to run your 
(68000) programs faster than you can, in a window, on a 
our computer, while we multitask other software.. Thus in the 
future, there will be true Open system computing, not by everybody 
giving up their ivory towers and settling on Unix, or whatever, 
but simply by our computers being fast, and upgradeable and easy 
enough to use, that they can emulate any other computer..

5. (Ooops, second lastly,) The PC market is a professional busines 
machine, Amstrad produced a PC clone, because that is where the 
bucks are, Lotus finally chose to switch to a Windows version of 
it's 1-2-3 package, because of those same bucks. And however good 
the ST is in it's present and future incarnations, Atari will make 
it some way PC and 'Windows' compatible to get it's share of those 
bucks..

And so, am I rubbishing your computers? No, not a bit, the ST is 
one of the best value for money machines around, but if a machine 
with the potential of the Archimedes is still a lame duck in the 
software stakes, what chance do the ST, the Amiga, and (Sickbag 
noises..) the Spectrum have??? We all laughed at the ZX81 when we 
got our Spectrums, and soon after, many people with a Commodore 64 
laughed at the Spectrum, then we laughed from the security of our 
ST's.. If you want to know what the PC of ten years time will look 
like, look at Steve Job's NeXT computer, but it will still run a 
PC Windows O/S..

And finally, what was this article written on, well it is a modal 
causality machine with multiprocessing and a digital concept to 
output typeface....Alright... I typed it on a 1950's manual 
Olympia typewriter!!!!!!

„(And I had to bloody well re-key it on to my STE, get electronic 
or shut up mate!!!! - CIH...)

…If anybody wishes to disagree with any part of the content of this 
article, preferably violently, then don't hesitate to submit 
entries on a 3.5 inch disk to the usual correspondence addresses, 
my own response can be seen in the mock(ing) 'Bald Git in a Suit' 
demo review..... Love (Platonically speaking) CIH....
