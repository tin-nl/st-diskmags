                               WARBIRDS
                               ========


First sight: EDDIE

     It's World War I and you have  just been given a brand new, state
of the art biplane in which to  strut your stuff.  All of the missions
you can choose to fly involve shooting  down one or more enemy planes,
or if in link up mode, one or more friends.

     The first thing that you notice  about  Warbirds, is the range of
options which you can fiddle around  with.   You can change key points
that will make your plane  almost  invincible,  or  you can be "a real
hero" and play at a high  level  of damage, risking being brought down
by a couple of well placed shots.  This means that you can adjust your
game as you get more skilled at it and this adds long term appeal.

     In single player mode there are  six different missions, each one
harder than its predecessor but all  of  them basically the same.  You
must shoot down enemy planes before  they  get you, however this is no
Blue Lightning.  Your controls are  more  reminiscent of a flight sim,
although much simplified and so Warbirds cannot be called a fast game.
It is a slow shoot em up and  because it is slow, strategy and cunning
come into it.  It is impossible to describe the satisfaction of diving
down onto your unsuspecting prey, from  above and then blasting it out
of the sky.  There are also clouds to hide in, on or under and there's
€the option to land for  more  ammo  -  although  if you've set ammo to
'unlimited' this can be avoided.

     Invariably, Warbirds comes into its own  when  you play a link up
game - shooting down someone you know is much more fun than blowing up
The Red Baron - and  the  playing  area  is  large,  so even with four
players, there will be places to hide when you're wounded.  It is more
difficult to hide when your tail is smoking, but hey, that's life!

     Overall I liked Warbirds.   The  controls  are  not 'radical', no
sharp turns etc. can be made, but you can do plenty of loops and dives
and it  is  more  realistic,  than  Blue  Lightning.   My  only  other
criticism is  that  it  is  quite  one  dimensional.   Blue  Lightning
involved bombing targets,  but  Warbirds  is  simply about dog-fights,
with the added fun of a multi-player option.


SECOND SIGHT: Mr. Pink

     War! What is it good for?  Absolutely loads of things, especially
when related to computer game  type  software.  Warbirds has little in
the way of plot or missions, you  simply have to blow your opponent(s)
out of the sky. There  is  none  of  the  control learning drudgery or
flying around doing nothing  that  are  the  centre  piece  of most PC
flight sims, this game is all about action.

     The controls are very  simplistic  -  you  can't  even change the
speed of your plane  (although  when  diving  you  will notice a speed
increase) and your only weapon is a front mounted machine gun.

     Unusually for a flight sim, the  game  is not totally based on 3D
graphics. There is  a  minimal  about  of  ground-based 3D structures,
mostly barns (those of you living in Wales will feel at home with this
game), but the  main  action  takes  place  in  the  clouds  which are
sprites. The Lynx's graphics chip has  a field (sky?) day scaling this
fluffy objects, and this all looks surprisingly good. In the heat of a
dogfight you don't  pay  too  much  attention  to  the scenery, Sunday
€drivers don't last too long as pilots.

     The game is totally configurable -  it is like someone has hacked
into the cart and  trained  it!  You  can  make yourself invulnerable,
choose up to  infinite  rounds  of  ammunition,  change  your starting
point, collision detection.  This  allows  to  ease  yourself into the
game, disabling helpful options as you get better.

     As with all  games,  this  is  much  better  linked  up with some
friends battling it out in the skies,  but  even  on its own this is a
great little game. Flying high? You will be.

                             ============

First Sight: Mr. Pink

     It  all  seems  plausible   enough.  Inter  governmental  tension
(stressed out civil servants?) leads to nuclear war. Millions die in a
flash of heat more intense than  a  Sahara summer (the Pentium must be
overheating again). Ruthless death  squads  intent  on controlling the
planet. Road rallies set  up  for  the  death squad leaders amusement.
This kind of thing happens every  day.  But a prototype car which only
€one person in the world can fit  into  - and this person happens to be
you - what are you? Some kind of deformed ant?

     On with the game - and most people  have seen it or its clones on
one platform or another. You race to across stretches of road shooting
other cars, avoiding mines and road  side  towers that shoot you. From
time to time a helicopter  type  thing  drops  an extra weapon on you.
Cheers, but is it safe  dropping  a  cruise  missile from a flying jet
onto a car moving  at  200mph  whilst  simultaneously  being shot out?
Perfectly  safe,  reassures  the   right-thinking  scientist  who  has
defected from the death squads and enlisted you.

     This is the type  of  game  the  Lynx  loves  -  lots of cars and
roadside objects to  scale  -  and  consequently  it  runs  very, very
quickly indeed, some would  say  too  fast,  but  then  again they are
probably PC owners who are used  to  all  their games being written in
COBOL and crawling along at one frame a day.

     If you like fast mindless fun  and  the idea of combining a shoot
em up with checkered flag appeals  to  you,  then you already own this
game. In fact, you probably wrote  it.  If you were unfortunate to own
the dreadful ST version of  this,  try  to  forget about it (not easy,
although there is medical help at  hand  now)  and try it on the small
screen. It really is a blast.

Second sight: EDDIE

          There's one thing to  say  about  this  game  and that's: no
realism whatsoever.  It is completely impossible to drive off the road
and ridiculously easy to keep your  car  in the centre.  There are two
main types of baddie cars,  one  type  is  very  easy to shoot and the
other is impossible. (the  programmers  obviously don't vote liberal!)
Other hazards are guns at the  side  of  the  road, but the game is so
fast you've soon passed them by and  the UFO type thing that helpfully
drops you weapons is just annoying as it blocks your view of the road.
There are mines, spikes and oil  to  avoid  and extra fuel to pick up,
which you really need, because your  fuel  runs  out as quickly as Mr.
€Pink's wit.

     If you want fast and I mean  FAST action, with short term appeal,
then this is for you.  Otherwise,  if you're a serious 'racing gamer',
all I can say is, go and get Checkered Flag!

First Sight: EDDIE

     Attention!  It's... All Points  Bulletin.  (For  those of you who
always wanted to know what it stood  for.)You are a tough, mean, butt-
kicking, gum chewing, all American  cop.   And your only embarrassment
in life is that you're called Officer Bob.

     In your blue and purple crime-busting police car, you must cruise
the streets of...somewhere,  catching  all  manner  of criminals, from
small-time litter  bugs,  to  drug  dealers  and  not  forgetting  the
€awesomely evil 'honkers', who beep their horns too often...!

     As you cruise the roads,  you  must  keep  a  watchful eye on the
time-limit and your 'gas' level.   Time  can  be  gained by picking up
doughnuts (!) and your 'gas'  can  be  refilled  at the 'gas station'.
Money can also be collected and used to buy add-ons for your car, like
extra speed etc.

     The best aspect of this game is  the samples.  If you try to pull
over an innocent, law-abiding  citizen,  they  will  say  a variety of
things, ranging from: "Who me?", to:  "Get lost!".  Criminals are more
passive, when you catch them and usually say, "Sure thing officer."

     You can only pull over a  car  by pressing button A, which sounds
your sirens, but if you constantly hold it down, none of the criminals
will do anything bad, so you can't pull them over.

     You do not have lives, you have  demerits and these can be got in
a variety of ways.  Crashing and exploding your car will gain you one,
so will running over a pedestrian, (although it's worth it just to see
the little skull and cross  bones!)bumping  into any cars, criminal or
otherwise, WITHOUT your siren on  also  gains  a  demerit and once you
have 10, your boss kicks  you  out  and  you  are  forced to work in a
doughnut factory for the rest of your life, where you vow never to eat
another doughnut, after seeing what goes into them.

SECOND SIGHT: Mr. Pink

     "How to be an honest cop"  is  the title of probably the funniest
film ever made. It'sFrench,  and  there  is  a  version that has been
dubbed in English which ITV show in their 'Night-Time' schedule. It is
unmissable. APB is also  a  game  about  'cops'  which  is packed with
humour. The lynx's severely underused sound capabilities are shown off
here with some excellent samples. The  graphics are straight from Kwik
Saves no-frills range and probably cost  17p.  The control method is a
bit fiddly  at  first  with  the  button  for  siren  and  button  for
accelerate having to be pressed  simultaneously  -  it  takes a bit of
€getting used to, but perseverance is the key here.

     Tracking down the litterbugs and other undesirable types contains
an element of fun which other  games  -  such  as  Chase HQ - tried to
capture but failed. APB works; its quirky, its different and its fun.

                            CHECKERED FLAG
                            ==============

FIRST SIGHT: Mr. Pink

     "Is it Checkered or Chequered?"  was  the question on the world's
lips as this  game  was  recently  released  on  the  Jaguar, with our
American friends deploring the  "incorrect"  spelling,  which is a bit
rich from people who can't spell centre  or colour and don't even know
what a pavement is. Protext didn't even recognise the word, suggesting
I should use "Chickweed".

     Checkered Flag was one of the first racing games ever. In fact it
was probably coded before cars  had  been  invented,  making it into a
prophecy of Nostradamus proportions. The game  itself is a legend. You
€race other cars. Turn at the  corners. First to complete the allocated
number of laps wins.  No  gimmicks.  No  guns, pit stops, helicopters,
drugs or scantily clad women (well, perhaps  a few). This is all about
racing. Its big. Its hairy. Its macho.  It sweats profusely. It is one
of the finest pieces of software to hit the Lynx.

     It is ironic that the Jag  'Flag'  doesn't  live up to its little
brother's effort - this game is  absolutely flawless. It doesn't worry
about shifting big colourful 3D graphics  -  it knows what it good at,
scaling nice 2D roadside objects,  mainly billboards advertising other
lynx games, STs, TTs and Portfolios! You get to select your race track
and number of opponents - you even get to select the colour of the car
and your sex, and this makes a big difference to the gameplay.

     You can also link up and race against 6 friends - this is perhaps
the best multiplayer on  the  lynx  -  but  even  on  your own you are
guaranteed hours of entertainment. This is  to  the Lynx what Vroom is
to the ST, and it's simply wonderful.


Second Sight: EDDIE

     Not another Checkered Flag, there's so many of them!  I even seem
to remember we had a  one  on  the  Speccy,  although it never loaded.
Anyway, enough of that.

     Yes, it is Checkered Flag  (yawn),  but  it  is a good version of
that ye olde Atari classic.  It has good graphics, some nice samples -
although the usual car drones are there  - and it's very playable.  It
also has some nice touches, like being  able to choose the sex of your
driver, so that (predictably) if you're  a  male  and you win, a large
blonde in a swim suit brings in your trophy, but if you're a female, a
large hunky bloke in a G-String does the same!  All that you ever need
for a good game!

     It is a predictable 'racing  game',  but  for one of those horrid
things, it's actually quite good....sigh.
