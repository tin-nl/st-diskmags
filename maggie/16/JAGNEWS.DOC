  Jaguar Price Slash

  Atari's Jaguar has now got an official RRP of œ199 in the UK.
Expect to be able to buy one mail order for a little over œ150
in the coming months.  In the US, Jaguar sales were below 
expectations according to one of the Tramiels.


  CD Rom at last?

  The Jaguar's CD Rom Drive has been a long time in development 
but is expected for release in the US mid February. I believe the 
delays had more to do with software than hardware.  Atari seem to 
have been asking developers what specs they would like to see in 
the final version - this is probably the reason for all the 
stupid rumours of extra texture-mapping processors.  It was 
officially launched at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in the
US on January 6th and some units may hit shops from 16th Jan.

  The drive itself uses a Phillips mechanism but it is unsure yet 
€whether Phillips will be manufacturing the whole unit as with IBM 
& the Jaguar itself or just supplying the bare drives.  The CD Rom 
will not play Phillips CDi games, there was a possibility of this 
but the CDi features some quirky tricks which were seen as too big 
an obstacle (although Bill Rehbock says it can't be ruled out for 
the future).

  The best news concerning the CD Rom is it's competitive pricing
at only $150 (Expect œ150 in the UK).  Also expect a decent price 
slash on the Jaguar base unit very soon and possibly a different 
pack-in.  It is unknown which title, if any, will come as a pack-
in with the CD Rom drive but Jeff Minter's Virtual Light Machine 
comes on ROM and produces psychedelic effects on screen (81 all 
together) in sync with the music.  The audio can be taken from 
the back of the unit to an external amplifier.  VLM can be seen 
in action at the end of the latest Atari promo video (distributed 
by Jaguar Owners Club in the UK) to the CD delights of the 
Tempest 2000 sound track.

  Atari are hoping to have 8-10 titles by the end of March.  Good
luck to them - other reports claim the same figure for the year's
end.

The first 5 titles will be Blue Lightning, Battlemorph, Highlander,
Demolition Man and Creature Shock.

 The CD Rom specs (as far as I am aware) are as follows:

* 790 Megabyte storage capacity.

* ~353 Kbyte per second sustained data rate (ie dual speed).

* CinePak decompression giving full screen 24bit True Colour fmv
  at 24 fps.  It is said to be the best version of CinePak on
  any format.

* MPEG 1 with additional cartridge allowing play of CD films.
€
* CD+G & Kodak PhotoCD compatible.

* ? 2 Meg of DRAM ?

When it was seen recently at WCES, the CD Rom was said to deliver
slightly better FMV than 3DO.


  Get Connected

  The Jag Link, a device to link at least 2 Jaguars over a distance
of upto 100 feet, is due for release before Summer.  It will cost
around œ25 and will allow 2 Jags with 2 of the same networked games
to compete against each other.  The only game to support this at
this moment is iD's Doom.

  The Voice Modem will allow similar features as the above but
also utilise a phone line for long distance playing. It will carry
voice data and have call waiting (to allow important calls to get
through).  Expected price is œ150 and it is due in Autumn.


  Virtual Jaguar

  Virtuality are still working in conjunction with Atari to bring
a VR headset to the Jag in time for next Christmas (Price œ200).


  Atari 'Swamps' Jaguar Game Market

  In the run up to the holiday season Atari delivered a new stash 
of cartridges onto the market.  Along with the conversions from 
Amiga and 16bit consoles of Bubsy & Zool 2 came Kasumi Ninja and 
the title every self respecting Jaguar owner has been waiting 
for... Iron Soldier.

€  Initial peeps at these titles reveal Bubsy and Zool 2 to be 
just what you might expect - standard platformers - but, since 
the Jaguar didn't have a single platform game before (Dino Dudes 
doesn't really qualify), I doubt there can be any serious 
complaints.  OK, these port-overs are not what anyone ever 
dreamed about purchasing a Jaguar for but they are above average 
for their genre and better the original versions with ease.

  Iron Soldier is said to be the best cart available by the vast 
majority of on-liners encountered...the video will show you why - 
take a look.  Wait for the review in the next issue.  Eclipse
are currently working on Iron Soldier 2 which will be out in time
for Christmas '95.  Due to an 'error' by someone at the Jag Owners
Club it looks like I'm going to have to wait to get hold of this
one to review...it is on sale in the UK as of 6th January.

  The jury seems to be out on Kasumi Ninja - there have been 
several reviews posted to the internet and each subsequent file 
seems to come out with a different verdict.  The major problem 
people seemed to see with the game was the choppy animation - 
from what I have seen on the promo video this complaint can be 
justified to some extent.  What you have to remember is that the 
quality of graphics is very high and the enormous amount of 
different animation cells is astonishing considering it's done in 
16bit colour - hit someone from behind & they will fall forwards, 
hit them from the front & they fall backwards...).  What really 
matters is gameplay and my copy is due to arrive shortly before 
this file is to be sent off to CIH, so my review will have to 
come next time (along with at least Iron Soldier, Val D'Isere and 
hopefully the CD Rom drive).  Any problems with this game look to 
be made up for with the release of Ultra Vortex very soon - this 
looks a MUST BUY.  Atari seem to be holding back with the 
finished Ultra Vortex to give Kasumi Ninja a chance of selling a 
few units (maybe I'm just a little too cynical!).  Ultra Vortex
is vastly improved over the versions seen at previous shows and
is very near to a release to testing.

€  Val d'Isere

  Where did this title come from?!  I hadn't heard a single thing 
about this game until I saw a Beta version which looks so smooth 
and so slick...well, if the idea of a skiing/snowboarding doesn't 
appeal then try to get a look at it when it is released later 
this month (January).  It's truly amazing and it's on sale in the
US after a short 3 week delay.

  Fight For Life

  Fight For Life is the Jaguar interpretation of Sega's Virtua 
Fighter.  Well, actually, that is not quite being fair to the 
Jaguar title - Bill Rehbock claims that it "... is a 3D One or
Two Player tournament fighting game with full character 
texture mapping, morphing, amazingly fast camera tracking and
more flexibility than Virtua Fighter could ever hope to have."  
That's no mean statement!  I'm watching an early-early preview 
now on my other screen & the more I watch it the more of a 
great game it looks!  A later version at the WCES was said to
be vasty improved - close in quality of presentation with Sega's
Virtua Fighter.

  The game is set in Hell, with each character fighting his or
her way through for the chance of redemption & be able to live
again.  There are 8 characters to choose from & the other 7
must be defeated before the final fight with the end boss.
Characters have 5 special moves & once an opponent is defeated
the player will be allowed to choose 2 of their moves.

  Motion capture was used to digitise realistic movements for
the fighters (almost 200 moves are possible in total).  Expect
it in late March.

  The main coder on this project is a guy who had a major hand in 
many of the Sega Virtua arcade games.  The title music is from 
Joe Vitale (who has worked with the Eagles & has a couple of 
€albums of his own.  The track is to be released on his 
forthcoming album & was written specifically for the Jaguar game.
This is multimedia! :)

  The cart is to be a 4 Meg monster (or 32 Meg if you are a 
SNES/MD owner).  With all that room for a polygon-based title 
expect some cool stuff in there.

  Demolition Man

  Demolition Man has come on since last showing and is said to
be virtually identical to the 3DO version - just a straight
of a rather poor, over-hyped effort.

  Other Game Info

  Games due 'real-soon-now':

  Syndicate         Ocean              RRP œ49.99 (also has some

  The details of which Sega games Atari has started to convert 
to the Jaguar will be released VERY soon.  Be careful to keep an 
eye out for information...or wait until the next Maggie!

Thea Realm Fighters is a new (er,fighting?!) game to be released
€this year, as is Batman Forever.  Batman Forever is obviously
based around the Warner film due out in Summer.  A simultaneous
release would be a good move from Atari but it is expected more
towards Autumn.

Thea Realm Fighters uses motion capture along with four martial 
arts experts originally used in Mortal Kombat games.  It is to be
a similar game to Mortal Kombat/Kasumi Ninja/Ultra Vortex judging 
by early reports.  There are to be at least 25 opponents in this
including 12 main characters & 12 special characters.  There are
4 different modes of play with over 30 different backgrounds.
Expected release is late Summer/early Autumn.  It is now
obvious why Atari dumped a 80% finished Kasumi Ninja on the
unsuspecting Jag community - they are said to be very excited
about this one.

  Rayman, the awesome-looking UBIsoft platformer has been delayed 
yet again.  The delay seems to be due to UBI also producing the 
game for the under-powered 32X Sega Megadrive add-on - they will 
be advertising the game for both formats at the same time.  A 
playstation version is also planned for release when the machine 
is released.

  Primal Rage, Time Warner Interactive's amazing fighter 
featuring dinosaurs as the main characters is due for release on 
Jaguar in late Autumn/early Winter '95 on Jag CD Rom as a 1 or 2
player game.

  Time Warner Interactive have announced Power Drive rally for
release on the Jag in '95. it is a conversion of a SNES game and
is being developed by Rage in the UK.

Also of note...Bullfrog, those nice chaps who brought us Syndicate
and Theme Park have been swallowed up by software giant Electronic
Arts.  Don't expect any further Jaguar releases from Bullfrog as
EA are 'in bed' with other companies who are in direct competition
with Atari.

  Tempest CD

  Atari's first ever release of a game soundtrack was made late 
last year in the US.  Featuring remixed, professionally edited 
techno tunes it's a must for T2K fans.  It will be made available
in the UK from the Jaguar Owners Club (price & date unknown). The
track listing is as follows:

  1.      Thermal Resolution       3:59
  2.      Mind's Eye               4:52
  3.      T2K                      5:23
  4.      Ease Yourself            7:52
  5.      Tracking Depth           5:04
  6.      Constructive Demolition  4:05
  7.      Future Tense             5:54
  8.      Digital Terror           5:07
  9.      Hyper Prism              4:26
  10.     Glide Control            5:12
  11.     Ultra Yak                4:00
  12.     2000 Dub                 7:31



  Time Warner Cable

  The Jaguar is to be used in conjunction with the US's new Time 
Warner cable systems.  Currently being tested in the Florida area 
the system downloads Jag games into your home cable box (which 
obviously contains a Jag!) and also allows on-demand viewing of 
films & sporting events.  There are several systems in 
competition with Time Warner's but having the Jaguar has to give 
the system a boost and should also help out Atari too.

  CBS news interviewed the owners of the first home to receive 
the new hardware and the son of the couple was asked about the 
€games... "The best graphics I've ever seen in any game...".  It's 
just as well they didn't ask how well they played - the poor kid
was playing Crescent Galaxy!


  Cat Box

  The CatBox was seen for the first time at a pre-Christmas Atari 
show in the US (the Toad Fest).  The delays in releasing this 
unit are most probably due to frequent changes with both the CD 
Rom and networking facilities.  The Black Cat Design units are in 
production now but initial reports of two versions seem to be 
incorrect.  There will possibly be a cut-down version made 
available at a later date but there will only be a single model 
for the near future.  It was officially released in very late '94 
in the US.
