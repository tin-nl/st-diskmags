Hi Chris,

Here's the article I promised you.

On the  10th,11th,and  12th  of  November  this  year,  there  was  an
Exhibition at the NEC in Birmingham about Design technology education.

I went there on the Saturday afternoon and this is my wry sly and dry
account of the day.

Firstly, why does the NEC only  have  one  door,  and why is it so far
from the carpark, and why did I  have  to walk past my Exhibition hall
for half a mile,through that impressive  but removed entrance and back
to my hall travelling a nominal 200 yards but an actual mile?  Answers
on a brick to, the manager, NEC,Birmingham........

                 This exhibition only occupied  one  hall and was very
similar to the one I attended two years ago as far as layout etc....

The overall impression was  one  of  poor  design.  Many companies had
little idea of how to lay  out  their  stands.   Some people went to a
great deal of effort  to  have  token  children  doing token things on
token projects, carefully concealing the facts that the pupils efforts
in Design Technology being 20% better than average, required 100% more
money and equipment and materials to achieve.  Shurely Shome MISHtake?

The exhibition was broadly dividable by the cynical into 3 areas,  The
floggers, the gogglers, and  the  advertisers.   The floggers were the
suppliers of equipment who usually  had everything or nothing labelled
and priced.  There were many grey  suited businessmen with oily smiles
and oilier handshakes  dispensing  the  world  according  to  them and
handing out brochures only upon sight  of  a  head of faculty badge or
headmasters certificate. Most of these were selling equipment which is
not bought directly by somebody,  but  instead  is purchased through a
county office, or through a grant.  Possessing a Ministry of Education
badge would have given me ample  opportunity  to be better buttered up
than a turkey!  Accompanying these  legions  of furniture sellers were
various small stands selling  the  minutiae  of Design Technology.  At
what other show can you  buy  blank  dice?   Blank playing cards?  and
cotton reels!  I did buy a rather  natty 6 disc holder designed to fit
into an inside pocket and  surely  compulsory anti sniper equipment in
Vietnam if they had  been  available...   Pity  you have  to spend ten
minutes easing the discs into it or they crack when you slam the lid!

The Gogglers were the display  artists.   They  were not going to sell
much there but they were showing off.  15,000 lathes and morticers and
computer systems.  Extra complex pneumatic ram kits and stands showing
packs of materials for teachers  to  rush  back to school and convince
the head to buy them. These were  a  lot more friendly and had time to
talk.  The software retailers were  there  as well,  but surprisingly,
the No.1 educational computer supplier Acorn, was absent.  Perhaps not
that surprising if you know  anything  about the appalling service and
pointless pricing of  this  company.   Think  of  Apple  pre 1991, and
replace all their intellectuals  with  grey  suited ex educationalists
and remove any streak  of  independent  thought  and  vision as far as
developing markets.   The  systems  being  used  were,  Archimedes for
software pupils used  mainly.   PC  for  systems teachers demonstrated
mainly, and Apple  for  anything  chunky.   Acorn Archimedes computers
were much in evidence on  half  the  stands,  but many developers were
hedging their bets with the introduction of an Acorn that Eats pentium
PC's, and runs  Acorn  and  PC  software  at  the  same  time  in full
displayed 24 bit  colour  to  massive  resolutions.   Many  houses are
converting their existing and producing  new packages in dual formats.
It has to be said that  the  Archimedes versions are faster and easier
to understand when it comes to utilising  them even where the look and
feel are made to  be  as  similar  as  possible.   Usually the Windows
versions are clones of the Archimedes screen displays and fonts.

The advertisers  were  the  oddest,   Huge  companies  such  as Shell,
Pentel, BP who had lots of dead  processed trees to give away on shiny
Kaolin impregnated backings covered with oil derived films to impart a
sheen  to  the  contents   detailing  their  environmentally  friendly
ambitions.  Now, you may say, where  were the freebies.  THERE WEREN'T
ANY!!!!!! Okay the odd pen or placky  bag and tacky, clip this to your
belt and look like a prat, key rings.  No free scalpel blades, no bits
of wood, no playdough  or  magnets  or  fluffy  bugs.   This was not a
collectors show and apart from the  reek  of  PVC, the only free smell
discernible on the mass transportation to  and from the exhibition was
the reek of waxed cotton jackets  and  the  taint of a thousand bowels
fired by low salaries and  dusty  working conditions.  Particulary odd
were the pen sellers who could sell  you  a  felt pen set for œ10 that
ordered through normal channels would cost  œ13.   It would be nice if
the motor show was like that!

Deeply sad were the many  stands  hired  by  small colleges to promote
themselves.  Devoid of  inspiration,  artistic  content  and direction
they were seas of blue velcro  backed  display panels broken only by a
few bits of  information  thrown  up  from  cheap  desk top publishing
systems.  Inside these booths of despair crouched three or four people
on plastic chairs with  their  arms  crossed  flanking some poor video
showing the courses  and  real  people  involved  in South Chesterleaf
School of Wood Torturing.  Most passed these booths hurriedly glancing
with fascination out of their eyes at the tortured souls as some would
pass a particulary smelly beggar.  The encumbents could only stare out
at stands boasting  the  luxury  of  elbow  room.   They exhibited the
demeanour of double glazing salesman  down  on  their  luck and if you
were unlucky enough to catch their eye,  they would spring at you with
renewed vigour seeking to enroll enough  people for the following year
to justify their existence.

Design technology is a subject still  in transition.  Like a blind man
playing patience with the wind of government (the bottom wind!)blowing
the cards around, many teachers  are  trying  to  make  sense of a new
world full of commitments to Computers and electronics and pneumatics.
Some are easy prey to  sharks  selling simplistic systems which appear
to be ideal but lock the  buyer  into pointless exercises using sticky
tapes and garishly painted bits  and  bobs  to achieve something which
looks technological.  A bit like those  mid 80's business men who knew
they  had  to  computerise  and   committed  themselves  to  'computer
consultants' therefore spending half  the  companies  budget to save a
sum of money a tenth  of  the  outlay.   Never  since the emperors new
clothes has so many  people  looked  at  the  style,  being unable and
lacking the knowledge to  assess  the  substance.   The  future may be
bright, but for some, it will be fluorescent!

The  overall  atmosphere  was  relaxed.   most  visitors  on  the
Saturday were not buying anything  for schools but looking themselves.
the heads of  faculties  and  buyers  came  during  the  week  but the
standard teachers like myself had  to  use  our weekends.  I came away
happy, and perhaps a bit too smug.
