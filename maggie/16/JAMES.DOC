                         PC Heaven?

James Ingram's little rant and rave about the evil
necessity of PCs.

It was with no small tinge of regret that I unplugged my
STe.  It is at moments like these that one feels a sudden
urge to refer to the beast which has sat on one's desk for
several years as "faithful", rather than the previously
preferred "bastard".  Yes, the machine which I was always
berating for being too slow, and not having a hard-drive and
not having a decent printer (admittedly due to my reluctance
to buy one), has finally been packed away.  Well, I say
packed away; it's actually on a chair behind me, because
there's nowhere else to put it.

I daresay that in years to come it will probably suffer the
same fate as my Spectrum 48K+ and my Spectrum 128k+.  It will
go into a brown cardboard box, and have other boxes put on
top of it.

What dreadful sin could my Atari STe possibly have committed
to suffer such an end?  The sin that all hardware eventually
commits, of course...  that of not being fast enough, or
having enough memory, or being able to do the things which
you read about in glossy magazines.  Ah - talked myself into
a bit of a corner there.  I suppose it all depends on
_which_ glossy magazines you tend to read.  Some things you
read about would be impossible with _any_ computer.  Except,
perhaps, an Amiga.

No, the real sin of my STe was that I was, quite simply,
very very bored with it.  Shock!  Horror!  The Politically
Correct ST people step back in amazement.  You're not
allowed to call it boring!  The scene isn't dying, surely?
Believe me, it is.  I recognise the symptoms.  You think it
will never happen to your computer - it'll never be
obsolete, will it?  I owned a Spectrum, and before that a
ZX81.  Believe me, the ST will be obsolete, and in not too
much time.  It is already obsolete, but I mean the scene
will be dead, because everyone will simply pack their
machines away... look at the Spectrum.  It used to cost 150
quid at one time.  You can get them for a fiver now.  No-one
wants 'em anymore.

I got out at about the same point in the life cycle of the
Spectrum.  Oh, don't worry, there's plenty more to come.
After I bought my STFM I would still buy the odd Speccy mag
and be amazed at what they had been doing on it since I
left.

On the other hand, Spectrum games didn't seem to dry up
quite as quickly as ST games have done.  It doesn't seem too
long ago that debates were raging about there being too much
coverage of games in ST Format.  How many games have been
covered in the last few months?  The difference is dramatic.
The games are just not emerging any more.

Watch and wait as ST Format slowly but surely gets thinner
as advertisers quietly withdraw...  Remember how thin CRASH!
was at the end?  Your Sinclair hung on for a few more
months, before it too died (seemingly from anorexia).  And
I still remember with pride when it was called Your Spectrum
and was as fat as an American politicians wallet.

But wait!  Enough of this talk!  We can go on like this ad
infinitum, and everyone has heard it before.  The old topics
of "the ST's dying"... "why didn't Atari market the Falcon,
then it could have taken over"  etc etc etc....

What you really want to know about (because if you're
serious about computers you'll have to know about them) are
PCs.  Yuk.  Let's face it, if you want to turn a hobby into
a career, PCs are the only realistic way of doing it.
Unless you're Jeff Minter, or whats-his-name Braben who did
Elite-2.  But even they release their games on PCs.  The
bottom line is that being a shareware programmer for Atari's
is all well and good, but it's not going to support a wife
and 2 kids.  Unless they're a very patient wife and 2 kids,
and don't mind being hungry and scruffy a lot of the time,
and living on a bicycle.

So sooner or later, you are going to enter the PC arena,
like myself.  So let's have a brief look at PCs...

Remember the 8086?  No, neither do I.  I'm not quite that
old yet!  Well, it was one of the earliest PCs.  It was 8-
bit, and had only a 16-bit address bus (which meant that you
had a maximum of 64K of memory).  IBM decided to upgrade
their machines.  I'm not sure if there was an 80186, but I
know that there was an 80286.  This was a 16-bit (I think)
machine.  But it remained downwardly compatible with the
8086, so that 8086 programs would run on the 80286.

This was well and good.

Then came the 80386, which was much better than the 80286.
And the 80386 was downwardly compatable with the 8086.  And
this was a bit dodgy, because the 8086 had been obsolete now
for a while, since the 80286 came out, no-one was buying
8086s any more.

Then the 80486 came on the scene.  And it was downwardly
compatible with the 8086.  Which was bloody stupid, to be
honest.  Because the 8086 had been obsolete for so long now,
being 8-bit technology, that it was a waste of bloody time
to make the 486 compatable with it.  But, you see, all PC
programs are still written using 8-bloody-bit machine code!
It's still the same blinking machine language that the 8086
used (with a few additions)!  I've tried it, and it's like
trying to program a demented Spectrum that doesn't feel very
well.

Another thing that is bloody annoying is, of course, MS-DOS.
The only advantange of MS-DOS over GEM, as far as I am
concerned, is the ability to do things like:

     del *.bak
and
     rename james*.* jimmy*.*

And, yes, you've guessed it, MS-DOS is downwardly compatible
with some very early machines, which gives you all sorts of
problems if you're trying to use more that 640K of RAM.
Why?  Because when MS-DOS version 1 was written, they
thought that no-one would ever use more than 640K!  So
they made it very limited.

What the PC world needs, and I have been saying this for
years, is to break away completely and utterly from the 8086
and MS-DOS.  Maybe it will with the Pentium RISC processor
and the next generation.  We shall see...

Anyway, here I am, waffling on.  And I still haven't got
around to the actual point of this article.  I was going to
compare my brand new 486 with the old Atari.  How do they
compare?

Well....

Obviously, I much prefered the GEM environment to DOS.
Windows isn't bad, except that it is so slow, and keeps
crashing (later addition - a faulty RAM chip made it keep
crashing).  Configuring anything is bloody awkward for a PC,
and when you install new Windows software, it updates all
the Windows files, but won't tell you what it's done.  When
you need to take it out because it's messed everything up,
you never get rid of all what it did.  So the Windows files
just grow and grow

I'm having particular problems at the moment.  I have been
told it's probably to do with the way my memory is
configured in Windows, but Borland C++ will run for an
average of 3-4 minutes before it crashes.  Visual Basic will
run for 5-10 minutes.  And yes, They are both originals!
[later note - as mentioned, fault with RAM chip, now
discovered]

That's one thing I shall miss about the old Atari, the
assembly programming.  I refuse to even try to use the
ancient-Egyptian style 8-bit crap 80486 assembly, so I'll be
using C++.  The reason I bought this new monster, by the
way, was to learn Visual Basic, and hone my C++ skills in
anticipation of getting a degree in about a year from now.
When I graduate, I want to have experience in what the
industry actually wants programmers to have experience in!

I really do hate PCs, and owning one has not done anything
to change my mind.  They are still bloody awful machines.
Awkward and clumsy at the best of times, they sometimes seem
to be the Mr Bean of the business world.  Wouldn't it be
nice if there was a machine which combined the ease of use
of the Atari with the speed and processing power of PCs?  I
used the Macs at college the other day, and was in
rapture...  I will close this PC-bashing article by saying
that I really wish that Apple had dominated the business
market instead of IBM.  Our quality of life today would be
infinitely enriched.

One last note - I got out my STe yesterday, and had a jolly
good time.  Nostalgia can never start too soon.  Now, where
is that Spectrum power lead.....

...............................

Post Script

Well, I just thought that I'd mention something...  I'm on
my final year degree course, which is why I got this PC.
But spookily enough, one of the subjects I am studying is...
yes!  The 68000 chip and assembly!  So the old ST may yet be
revived briefly to do some  messing around.

By the way, the monitor on the flight boards we're using at
college is really crap.  Anyone know how to disassemble?  If
so, perhaps an article from you in Maggie wouldn't go too
far astray; I can't make head nor tail of how it's done just
by looking at the binary break-downs of the instructions in
a book.
