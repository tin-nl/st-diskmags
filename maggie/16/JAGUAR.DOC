                         JAGUAR DEALER VIDEO

Watched by Leon O'Reilly

One hour of continuous adverts.If this sounds like a nightmare to you,
perhaps you are better off  not  getting  the  new Jaguar dealer video
that is currently doing the rounds.  However,  if you own one of these
64-bit wonder machines or are thinking of doing so in the future, then
it is certainly worth a look.

The video opens with the infamous  "Do  the math" advert which was run
over in the USA. This  features  a  teacher   trying to educate a very
dumb and unrespondant class about the  merits of the Jaguar as opposed
to other consoles. She points out  the  Sega Genesis (Megadrive) is 16
bit, the 3DO (remember those?) is 32  bit whilst the Jaguar is 64 bit.
The class members don't seem to grasp the basic arithmetic behind this
and the teacher is forced into screaming the name "Jaguar" (pronounced
Jag-wur. Doesn't quite  sound  right  some  how.  These Americans eh?)
before scribbling "DO THE MATH" on the blackboard.

This advert is more symbolic than even Atari probably realise. You can
scream at people until you are blue  in  the face but the fact is that
the majority of the  computer  buying,  and  especially console buying
public, know very little about  the  technology they are getting. They
just see the adverts on the  box  and  all  their friends have them so
they want them. For Atari  to  establish  themselves  in such a market
they can lecture people  about  processor  speeds  and bandwidth until
they are blue in  the  face,  but  if  they  don't  give it some major
advertising support it will fail. "Do  the  math" is a fair attempt at
this with a bit of humour crammed  in.  There are also some very brief
screen shots: Wolf  3D,  Iron  Soldier,  Kasumi  Ninja,  Tempest 2000,
Checkered Flag and  Aliens  versus  Predator.  These  shots flash very
briefly onto the screen but it  is  immediately obvious that the frame
rate of checkered flag isn't so hot, and they do dwell on the visually
impressive AVP (and rightly so).

€The first game shown is  DOOM.  The  format  of  this video is that an
intro screen is shown with  the  game  name  and software house on it,
then there is a couple of  minutes  of  direct footage of the game. No
narrative, no indication to is availability, release date, price, size
(megabits) or format (Cart or CD). But  this is supposed to be running
on a monitor in a busy shop,  and  no one really pays attention to the
narrative. It's the Jaguar hardware that got to do the talking.

Unless you have  spent  the  last  century  on  a  faraway  planet (or
Birmingham) you will have heard of  DOOM - PC originate texture mapped
shoot em up. Leave your brains on  the coffee table and shoot anything
that moves and a few  things  that  don't.  Yes it's mindless, and yes
it's great fun. The question is how fast could the Jag get running?

The bad news is that it is  a  bit blocky. The vertical resolution has
definitely been reduced. The good news is  that it is a good deal more
colourful than it's PC cousin - the  16bit  colour is there for all to
see and the depth shading is certainly better, although this does tend
to make distant things a  little  too  dark.  Some of the monsters are
missing from the  PC  original,  but  the  framerate  looks very good,
equivalent to a very fast 486. This should definitely be one to buy.

DRAGON - THE BRUCE  LEE  STORY  isn't  quite  so impressive. Yes, it's
very standard beat em up fare - albeit with some very nice backgrounds
and some nice parallax. Some of  Lee's moves are recognisable to those
who have seen the  films  and  it  looks  like  it could be reasonably
entertaining, but it is nothing the 16bit consoles couldn't handle.

CHECKERED FLAG is  the  most  anticipated  VIRTUA  RACING beater from
REBELLION the programmers behind AVP.  We  get shown first the options
screen - not very exciting, but they  are trying to say "hey this game
is totally configurable, set it  up  how  you want!". Fair enough, but
where is the option to change control sensitivity (a la Super Hang-on)

The framerate, unfortunately is not  very  good  -  OK its better than
anything seen on the ST but in  this day of Ridge Racer, Virtua Racing
etc. it doesn't cut too much  ice.  There  are some nice touches - fog
€and rain especially, some OK backgrounds  and a neat rotating map. You
can also choose form a couple of  out-of car views which makes it more
like a flight sim than a racing game - unfortunately the frame rate is
more like a flight sim than a racing  game. I've heard that it is very
difficult to control also. Perhaps once you get past the disappointing
3D graphics and control method there is  a good game behind there, but
that isn't the point. This was  supposed  to be a real top-hole racing
game that have the other  console manufacturers pooing (!) themselves,
and it turns out to be what  looks like a very standard racer. Perhaps
our expectations were too high.

IRON SOLDIER is Eclipse's Jaguar Release. The  first thing we see is a
very neat texture mapped  cube  which  forms  the options screen. Very
quick indeed. Then we are  straight  into  the  action as you start to
blow away a few nicely detailed  3D  helicopters and crush a tank with
your foot. The framerate looks good, the explosions are excellent. You
also seem to be able to fit  a  camera  to a missile and watch it seek
and destroy its intended target  which  is  cool.  The aim of the game
seem to be destroy everything  so  it  should appeal to everyone. This
really does look fantastic,  and  it  should  be  (cliche ahoy) a real
system seller. Not only does it demonstrate the Jag's capabilities but
it raps them up it what looks like  a great game. But we should expect
this, its author is Marc Rosocha the man behind the two best shoot-em-
ups ever on the ST : Wings of death 1 and 2. Hats off to Mr. Rosocha.

Gremlin enter the fray next with ZOOL  2 - you know the business, make
a 'cute cartoon character' and shove  him  in a dull platform game and
it will sell by the bucketload.  It  worked  for Sega and Nintendo and
countless other companies have  tried  it.  Surely  the market must be
saturated by now? The  graphics  are  nothing  special  -  you get the
smooth scrolling and  parallax  that  you  expect  from  such a system
(which were missing on the ST/STe versions!) but this game really does
look Dull with a capital D.  If  you  really can't sleep at night, try
Newsnight - its cheaper.

The much hyped KASUMI NINJA kicks it's  way onto the screen. The first
thing you notice is the blood and  gore  -  there is a lot of it. It's
€dripping from the ceiling,  the  characters,  the roof everywhere. The
characters are digitised so the movement seems realistic and they have
quite a few extra moves and  tricks  up  their sleeves. The best Atari
can hope is  that  the  tabloids  pounce  on  the  game with righteous
indignity and proclaim it  "tasteless",  "shocking" and "corruptive to
the youth of today", "keep your children  away from them, it will turn
them into murderers". I pray this  will happen. It will sell thousands
of Jags! Write in and  complain  about  it  -  start the furore early.
Remember kids, there's no such thing as bad publicity!

Next up is a strange beast:  CLUB  DRIVE. "You can drive anywhere! Off
roads! Up sidestreets! Into  houses!  Round kitchens! Tables! Chairs".
Cute  concept,  but  does  it  work?  The  video  evidence  isn't  too
promising. The framerate seems to  be  similar to Checkered Flag (i.e.
not very good) with the two  player competitive mode slowing down even
further. The music sounds like a  poor  ST piece. I'm not totally sure
who this game is supposed to appeal  to really. Then again roping Eric
'I wrote MULTITOS' Smith in to  write  a  game was never a great idea.
After the travesty  of  that  'multi'  tasking  operating  system, his
crimes are stacking up. Come judgement day he will be sent to that hot
place inhabited by Man Utd fans  and Microsoft Employees and forced to
play this stupid game for eternity  (Multitasking on a Jag emulator on
an ST of course).

Advertistment tiiiimmmmmeeee-ah! AVP gets the  treatment with some kid
wizzing through its texture  mapped  level  -  and  very impressive it
looks too. There is a tap on  the  kids shoulder making him jump, only
for him to realise it's his mother's  hand. He shrugs and goes back to
some 64-bit fun and the camera pans  back to reveal an alien clutching
the arm of his  mother  and  tapping  the  boy  on  the shoulder. Very
tasteful. The screenshots are cool  and  the  concept should appeal to
the Beavis and Butthead generation.

There is now a few demonstration of  ALIENS VERUS PREDATOR (You can be
the alien! You can be the predator!  You  can be the marine or you can
be lunch!) Doesn't seem to be any option to be lunch though... (I'd be
scampi and chips). The  texture  mapping  is  very  well  done with an
€impressive frame rate. You see the gun  in  your  hand a la doom - you
can pick up a variety of  weapons.  The  Head  Up Display is also very
good with the alien scanner identical  to  the film (even has the same
beeping!) Killing aliens leaves them lying in  a pool of acid which is
harmful to tread on (remember the acid alien blood in the film).

Whilst the alien ship resembles  a  hospital  (there  are at least as
many doctors about! ie none!)  the  Predator  ship  has a more organic
feel.

When you are the alien you see your  claw  in front of you and you can
slash enemies, whip them  with  your  tail  and  cocoon them with your
mouth. This graphical sequence doesn't seem too realistic though.

The predator  sees  things  in  funny  shades  (at  least  when  he is
invisible) before killing off some marines.

The whole game really does  look  excellent  - lots of gung-ho action,
excellent graphics (the characters are  much better defined than Doom)
and there seems to be  a  bit  more strategy and intelligence involved
than there is in Doom. This realy  does look like a fantastic piece of
software and no  wonder  over  80%  of  jaguar  owners  bought it. Its
another  SS  (system  seller)  and  there  are  people  in  this  room
considering buying a Jaguar on the strength of seeing this AVP clip!

Beyond games' ULTRA VORTEX is up  next,  and it looks much better than
Kasumi Ninja or Dragon. The are  some humours characters and the whole
thing some to have been better designed than the other two titles with
more interesting characters  and  some  nice  backgrounds.  If you are
going for a beat-em-up this looks like the one to watch out for.

VAL D'ISER SKIING AND  SNOWBOARDING  skims  onto  the screen next. The
mountain background are very nice and the frame rate is fantastic with
the snowside objects and texture  mapped  floor moving at a phenonamal
rate. The downside is, well,  its  Skiing  isn't  it? I mean is anyone
really interested? If a bit of  snow based adrenalin pumping action is
your cup of tea, this could be for you.
€
Platform invasion! Yes, it's BUBSY.   Another bloody platformer with a
cute cartoon character. The  animation  is  very  good, there are some
nice cartoony  touches  -  it  looks  more  interesting  than  zool  2
(although that's not too hard!)  and  it  has  been successful for the
16bit systems, and if you ask me it should of stayed there. We want 64
bit not conversion of 16bit platformer cash-ins. Next!

Oh dear. DOUBLE DRAGON V - THE  SHADOW FALLS is another beat-em-up and
it looks the worst of  the  lot.  The  backgrounds  are sparse and the
characters don't have the  detail  of  the  Ultra  Vortex  ones or the
digitised animation of Kasumi  Ninja.  This  will  disappear without a
trace. Having five on the end of a title is always a bad idea - Police
Academy 5, Renault 5,  Radio  5,  Jackson  Five.  And  Double Dragon 1
wasn't much cop either, and  each  subsequent release has deteriorated
so we are left with  this  excuse  for  a  game.  I can't wait for the
shadow to fall on this pathetic series.

Delphine's FLASHBACK is  next.  You've  seen  Another  World. Yes it's
French -  lovely  graphics,  brilliant  animation  and  an  intersting
collection of sub games all relating to the main 'plot'. Another World
was one of the few games that took  a series of subgames and made them
into a decent final product, and Flashback does the same thing. Rumour
has it that it was coded for the ST but never released, so at least we
will see it on the Jag.  Looks  pretty smart, but not amazingly better
than the 16 bit versions.

BRUTAL SPORTS  FOOTBALL.  It's  Brutal.  It's  a  Sport.  It  involves
Footballs. It's also two player, poor scrolling, horrible graphics and
one of the most dreadful games  to  appear  on the Jaguar since Trevor
McFur decided to take on the dark forces of Crescent Galaxy. Difficult
to control and technically unimpressive, I  advise you to get "brutal"
with both this cart and its producer.

TEMPEST 2000 is probably the best  game  to  be released this decade -
perhaps the best game ever made, and that's official. If anyone needed
any further proof of the genius of  Jeff Minter, then seeing this will
€convince them. The advert doesn't  really  do it justice. The graphics
aren't great - they are  made  up  of  some  vector sprites and gourad
shaded webs with lots of dots. The dot explosioins are great, but it's
the music that steals the show -  it really is superb. Thumping techno
with some great samples, it really feels  like  it is part of the game
not stuck on afterwards.

The advert itself isn't  much  cop,  but  you  can't really convey the
quality of this game in  a  quick  televisual broadcast. There is some
footage of black  and  white  film  over  the  top.  Nice attempt, but
doesn't quite work. It is worth  buying  a Jaguar to play this. Forget
everything else, get a Jag, a big  TV,  a top quality HI-FI system and
Tempest 2000 and your life will be fulfilled in every way!

ID's WOLFENSTEIN 3D is next. Yes,  it's gauntlet from a 3D perspective
with loads of dogs  and  Nazis  to  shoot  (hooray!). The graphics are
nothing special, esp when compared with  Doom and the gameplay is very
simplistic. Doom offers more lasting appeal and there really isn't too
much point in getting its predecessor. However, everything moves about
at an astonishing rate and  it  is  worth  comparing this to the other
systems version of Wolf 3D to show just how much better the Jag is.

CYBERMORPH - you get it free with  the  Jag! I think everyone has seen
this, but for the Aliens (and Brummies) here goes:

Gourad shaded landscape ahoy! Fly  over  a  smart, fast 3D environment
collecting pods and shooting  things.  The  basis  of  this game - pod
collection - doesn't lead to too much strategy being involved, and the
auto-pilot's  patronising  comments  don't   help,   but  this  is  an
entertaining game and worth checking  out.  Attention To Detail's next
game 'Battlemorph' is one of the  first  for  the Jag-CD and should be
pretty special!

Why did they  include  this?  Yes  it's  everyone's non-favourite game
RAIDEN. This looks like a shoot em yp  from the mid 80s and it is! The
graphics are very poor (very  megadrive)  and the huge and unnecessary
status panel down the right hand side screams "STFM game! I can't move
€the entire screen at a decent framerate" but this is a Jag and this is
nonsense and whoever commissioned this release should be shot.

EVOLUTION DINO DUDES has appeared on many different systems under many
different titles (on the Lynx it was  'Dino-olympics' and on the PC it
was called 'Humans' there is  even  a  Falcon version kicking about!).
The gameplay looks interesting but not astounding, and the same can be
said of  the  sound  and  graphics  (although  there  are  some  smart
digitised pictures in the background).  Again,  this  is  not a 64 bit
showpiece, just a semi-entertaining conversion.

TREVOR MCFUR IN CRESCENT GALAXY  has  reached  cult status. Its infamy
grows daily. It is so bad  it  is  almost  good. The graphics are eye-
popping (in more ways than one) but  the gameplay leaves a huge amount
to be desired. If you really hate someone, buy them this.

WORK IN PROGRESS

OCEAN and BULLFROG  are  working  on  Syndicate,  a  big  hit on other
platforms and it looks like it should be a succes on the Jag if people
can sort out the fiddly control method.
They are also releasing THEME PARK which looks like it should be up to
the standard of the other versions.
These two  games  are  not  really  done  justice  by  the  video, the
scrolling on THEME PARK is especially bad,  but with these games it is
gameplay that matters!

TROY AIKMAN  overpaid  American  sportsman  action!  Yes  its American
Football, or "Rugby for  nonces  with  helmets and shoulder-pads". Not
the easiest game to convert to  the  computer,  this takes a forced 3D
perspective. The graphics aren't  too  good  and  I'm  not sure how it
plays - doesn't look too promising. With all sports games it is a case
of play it and find out....

Richard Branson's attempt at World  domination continues with VIRGIN'S
CANNON FODDER coded by  Sensible  Software.  Again  this  looks a very
competent conversion of the 16bit game (hey  this even came out on the
€ST). Is this the only ST and Jaguar  game? I wonder. Should be just as
good as all the other versions, I'm  just hoping they do a Jag version
of Wizball - easily the best thing they've done.

READYSOFTS DRAGON'S LAIR may have  Gameplay  to make even Trevor McFur
blush, but the graphics are nice!  But  even  the ST graphics of Space
Ace were amazing,  so  it  tells  you  little  about  a  system or its
graphical capabilities. Oh and the game is a dog by the way.

What is HOVER STRIKE? Who  coded  it?  No-one knows. Some nice texture
mapped and gourad shaded landscapes are involved, but it looks in very
early stages. Not at the 'wow' level  of Iron Soldier yet. One to keep
an eye on possibly, but it looks like  it may turn out as a poor man's
Cybermorph.

FIGHT FOR LIFE, despite having an awful title, is much more promising.
It is the Jag's 'VirtuaFighter' (hooray)  and was coded by one of the
men behind VF. It has a lot more  going  for it than the other beat em
ups. The 3D is  good  -  lots  of  polygons.  Not  too  many moves are
included, but the ones shown are quite  realistic. It will do more for
the Jag then the host of 2D beat-em ups being realesed.

BURN OUT also looks good  -  it's  Super  Hang-On, and it's very fast!
What more can you want? This  really  looks worth getting hold of. The
road surface is realistic  and  the  roadside  objects really fly by.
It's better than Checkered Flag and Club Drive!

RAYMAN is one of the  most  graphically  stunning games you'll see for
your Jag. OK, its a platformer,  but  overlook  that fact and you will
see some sumptious animation,  gorgeous  backgrounds and a barrel-load
of humour. It really is a treat.  It  don't know how it will play, but
when it looks this good, who cares? This is a real stunner.

The show ends with Jeff Minter's  VIRTUAL  LIGHT MACHINE. This will be
built into the Jag-CD and gives kaliedoscopic effects in time with the
music-CD you are currently  playing.  Very  psychedelic. Very Minter.

€Very good.  With over 80  effects  it  has the variety necessary. It's
enough to make videos redundant.


Overall - a lot to look forward to, some great titles already released
and some terrible games to avoid like the plague. But there is enough
quality here to keep Jag owners  happy  until Jeff Minter releases his
next masterpiece.
