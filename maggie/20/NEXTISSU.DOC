About the first couple of things we predicted in issue 19 came to pass, 
the rest?? Well..

In this increasingly unreliable column, we may see reports on the Atari 
Shows,  due in September, scream as things happen, and all kinds of odd 
people connected with the Atari scene in the UK will turn up here.. 

Also  next  time,   reviews  of  the  Nemesis  Falcon  accelerator,  an 
interesting cheap system for boosting the Falcon..  More on Apex 3, the 
final edition of ST News and more..

As far as we know,  Obsession Falcon is still on the cards,  but when?? 
Also the Falcon Owners group CD-ROM is still out there somewhere..  The 
Aggression 'Motion Blur' demo is slowly working towards completion, and 
the  new Avena/Digital Chaos demo should be something to  look  forward 
to..

In  fact,  Obsession Falcon is falling into that 'Exclusive Jeff Minter 
Interview' trap that ST News keeps falling into when they expect to see 
it  for a future issue but never do!!  Maybe we should hold out for  an 
exclusive review of the 'Cottage on the Moon' Polish produced  megademo 
also promised but never seen either??

Then we should start seeing full versions of the various 'Doom'  clones 
for  the  ST and Falcon,  and will review these as soon as we are  able 
to get them..

New  Tony Greenwood games!  Island strike has missed out on a review by 
Tony  G.  holding  it back until ST Dormant have reviewed it first  (so 
Xmas  time  then?)  Also more on this major new ST game  from  the  man 
expected to be seen at the Atari Shows in late September..

All your regular columns,  news, views and general weirdness will be in 
issue 21.. And this will turn up somewhere before the end of the year..

Apart from that, I wouldn't really like to say..
