Following the disappointing 96k  competition  and  the  stunning 4k competition,
Hyrdoxid were the first group to release their full demo entry for Symposium 96.
The French crew had coded "Realm Of Depth"  at  Fried Bits 3, but decided not to
release it as they feared that  the  competition  was  too strong. Over the last
year their coding skills have improved and they  are now ready to enter the demo
arena and fight face to face with the competition.

The demo begins in high resolution  with  a lovely hyrdoxid logo being displayed
on the right and a nice slimer  wobbling  up  the  left of the screen. This is a
very well presented effect and sets the tone for the demo.

The opening screen fades out and we into the next screen - a fire effect. Before
you groan, at least Hydroxid have  tried  to  do something with this old effect.
Each letter of "SYMPOSIUM 96" is stamped  onto  the screen in time with the drum
beat of the module and it then  burns  away.  The fire itself isn't the best you
will see - it is a bit chunky and slow, but it is a good idea.

Some blue text appears informing us  that  this  is "A SMALL INTRO FROM FRANCE".
Obviously no time to render a  tricolour,  but  the coders still have to display
their patriotism.

We now get another well  used  effect  -  the  picture  distorter. A female face
wibbles and distorts all about the screen. OK,  this effect is hardly new but it
still looks quite good. Which is nice.

At this point the 56001  starts  complaining.  It  is  getting rather bored just
processing samples and wants  to  get  into  the  action.  "How about some point
rotations?" It begs. Hyrdoxid are willing to oblige and get the little wizard to
shift trillions of points around the screen.

We begin with a large blue dot  sphere,  then  move  on to a vase type thing and
finish up with a cubic section  of  space  filled  with  loads of shaded dots. A
small DSP logo does it "design" thang in  the top right hand corner. All effects
seem to be running in a frame. Which is nice.

The DSP decides it wants something a little more challenging and whips up a nice
dot tunnel thing whilst a small yellow circular dot scroller is displayed in the
top right corner giving some technical information.

The next effect is slightly bizarre, but  at  least  it is original. A series of
interpolated vertical lines are drawn giving  the  effect of shaded hills. These
wobble about whilst a small picture of  a cigarette end is displayed above them.
I think this is  supposed  to  be  a  biting  satirical  statement  on design in
contemporary demos. Either that or they didn't have any mushroom graphics handy.

Another rotating dot effect appears, but this is the best in the demo. This time
we have a background (informing you  that  HDX  rules. What they rule it doesn't
say. Perhaps they are part of a monarchy  in some rural province of France.) and
nice big fish type dot shape rotating about which leaves pleasant dot trails. As
rotating dot effects go, this is one of  the  best  I've seen. I'm dot in love -
it's just a phase I'm going through.

The best picture from Realm Of Depth  is now displayed (back by popular demand).
A magnifying sphere bounces over the picture.  Again,  a well used effect, but a
very nice one. Even my mum approved,  proclaiming  it "That's the best demo I've
ever seen! Brilliant." But then she can't  even  format a disk without masses of
help, so doubts must be cast on her ability to judge demos!

Some typical french bile is then poured on  some people who failed to respond to
the coders' letters. Which reminds me, I'd better write back to Arto sharpish or
I'll feel the sharp end of his tongue...

We know get another face distorter  effect.  I  would  be highly critical of the
fact that this effect has been used twice in  the same demo if it wasn't for the
fact that the face in question  is  actually  Sherilyn Fenn's. Any excuse to get
Ms. Fenn into a demo is good enough for me. Top marks!

And then it  finishes  with  the  compulsory  end  scroller  containing credits,
greetings and  some  intelligible  french  mumblings.  The  scroller  itself  is
actually two plane and has both red and  blue text which livens things up a bit.
In the background a nicely  rendered  Hyrdoxid  logo  stretches and bends about.
This looks very good. The  scroller  finishes  at  exactly  the same time as the
music does, and the whole demo ends here, which is a good touch.

This demo is a step forward from RoD -  its  good to see the DSP being used. The
graphics again are good, its  a  shame  that  they  weren't able to include more
original artwork (due to the  absence  of  Nitrik  from Symposium '96). There is
still no texture mapping or gouraud (not yet!), but they have these routines and
they should be featured in a future demo.  Its  a  shame that blue seems to be a
colour much in favour with OH-  and  this  couldn't be properly displayed on the
Symposium viewing screen  and  hence  most  was  missed  by  the  voting public,
otherwise I'm sure this  would  have  won  the  competition.  OH-  Crikey what a
scorcher.
