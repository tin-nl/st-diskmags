        JOE SATRIANI - SHEFFIELD CITY HALL, 11th DECEMBER 1995
                Attended and reviewed by Michael Noyce


The Dutch leg of Joe's tour,  or at least a concert of it,  was covered 
by Richard Karsmakers in ST NEWS 10.2. Here's my report from one of his 
English tour dates.

Lets  start by spooling back to October last year.  I just happened  to 
accompany  a  friend into Sheffield to purchase a copy of  Atari  World 
from WH Smith and followed him into the Virgin Megastore just a  little 
futher along the high street.  I was wondering around the store looking 
lazily  over the seemingly endless racks of CDs when I noticed  a  huge 
in-your-face  poster  of Joe Satriani on the wall advertising  his  new 
album.  A new album?! Still reeling, my eyes passed over a list of tour 
dates.  Tour dates?!?!  With my pulse racing and the adrenaline flowing 
through  my  veins I glanced down the list stopping on  Sheffield  City 
Hall. Was I dreaming? Was Joe really coming to Steel City? On the tenth 
re-read  I  decided  my eyes were not deceiving me after  all  and  the 
pinching proved I was not dreaming.  Still in a state of shock I bought 
the  album  and dashed off to the City Hall.  It was closed.  Shit!  I'd 
have  to come back some other time during a free period.  Still,  I had 
the  new  album  to listen to.  Unfortunately,  not.  at the time my CD 
player  was  suffering from "Selective CD Playing Syndrome".  In  other 
words it was buggered and refused to play some of my CDs, including the 
new Satriani album. Boohoo. Life is cruel like that.

Many  thanks  to James,  my flatmate,  who loaned me his CD player  and 
fixed mine so I could listen to my CDs once again.

A  couple of days later I went to the City Hall again to enquire  about 
purchasing a ticket.  There were only about a hundred left,  all in the 
belconies, but I was lucky enough to get a ticket in the stalls, twelve 
rows  from  the  front and a bit to the left of the  stage.  An  almost 
perfect vantage point in fact. Thank God for cancellations.

After  a  few weeks the day finally arrived and it seemed  to  drag  on 
endlessly.  I  had to finish an assignment,  having stayed up all night 
working  on  it,  before  5:00pm  that day.  Once I'd finished  it  and 
returned  from  college after handing it in I had an early  tea  before 
getting ready to go out. Shortly before 7:00pm, ticket and CD liners in 
one hand (my flatmates were of the firm opinion that I wouldn't stand a 
chance  of  getting  the  CD liners signed) and  fifty  pence  for  the 
SuperTram ride to the City Hall in the other, I was ready to go.

Driver! City Hall and quick about it!!

I arrived shortly after 7:15pm and quickly found my seat. At 7:30pm the 
support act,  Rollover from Chicago, Illinios, came on and did a pretty 
good thirty minute set.  After that the stage crew got to work clearing 
the stage ready for Joe. After another thirty minutes, during which the 
hall  filled  rapidly,  the house lights dimmed and Joe (lead  guitar), 
Jeff  Campitelli  (rhythm  guitar,  keyboards,  percussion,  and  drums 
(phew!)), Jonathan Mover (drums), and Stuart Hamm (bass) came on stage. 
The  audience simultainiously erupted into a frenzied  mass;  clapping, 
waving, whistling, shouting and cheering.

They  played for about two and half hours with songs including  (in  no 
particular order):  "If",  "Down,  Down,  Down",  "Killer Bee Bop", and 
"Slow  Down Blues" from the latest album ("Joe Satriani"),  which sound 
much  better live than they do on the album.  "The Extremist",  "Summer 
Song"  (one of my favourite songs),  and "Tears In The Rain" (from "The 
Extremist").  "Flying In A Blue Dream" (from "Flying In A Blue Dream"). 
"Satch Boogie", "Circles", and "Lords Of Karma" (from "Surfing With The 
Alien"). Between the latter two songs Jonathan Mover did his obligitory 
drum solo (as featured on the "Time achine" album) which was absolutely 
amazing.  Stuart  Hamm  also  did  a bass solo that  really  wowed  the 
audience,  bringing  most  of us to our feet for several  minutes.  Joe 
persuaded him to come to the microphone to acknowledge the applause. He 
simply  said  "Thank  you",  Joe adding he (Stuart) was "a man  of  few 
words"  which bought another round of applause and laughter before  the 
concert could continue.

When they'd finished and left the stage the audience demanded more  and 
was  rewarded as the band came back on to do three  encores,  including 
"Surfing With The Alien", my all time favourite Satriani song. Everyone 
in the stalls moved to stand right in front of the stage and  generally 
flipped out to the music. It was pure orgasmic pleasure for the ears.

I must confess that I did get a bit carried away with the occasion.  At 
various  points I was standing up,  waving at Joe,  shouting and making 
lots of whooping sounds of shear delight and enjoyment.

After  the  concert,  ears still ringing with post-concert-deafness,  I 
made  my  way round to the back of the City Hall to the stage  door  as 
fast  as  I  could through the throng of people and  joined  the  other 
thirty-odd  fans waiting in the freezing cold for Joe to come  out.  We 
waited,  and waited, and waited. Then finally, some forty minutes later 
Stuart Hamm walked out and straight past us to the tour bus,  promising 
he'd  be  back.  He  duly was and patiently  signed  everything  shoved 
politely into his hands, including my CD liners! A few minutes later we 
were  told  that Joe would see us if we lined up along the  bus  in  an 
orderly queue.  Not that we were a rowdy mob or anything,  far from it. 
Somehow  I  ended up at the back of the queue so while I waited  I  got 
Jeff  Campitelli and Jonathan Mover to sign my CD liners too.  Finally, 
after what seemed like an age,  it was my turn.  I shook Joe's hand and 
gave  him  my CD liners and exchanged a few words about how  great  the 
concert  was  while he signed them.  My God!  I'd just met,  touched and 
spoken to one of my all time favourite musicians.  I will remember that 
moment for the rest of my life!

After  that  it  was  a quick trip on the tram  back  to  the  flat  to 
triumphantly  show off my signed CD liners.  All in all the evening had 
been  a definite ten out of ten on the good  old  "effing-good-evening" 
scale. One of the best evenings of my life so far.
