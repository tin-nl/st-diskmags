Well  we  bring  you yet another interview from  the  cutting  edge  of 
thingyness,  this time its Tony 'Stosser' Greenwood, the fiftysomething 
ace  programmer  and  coder behind such notable items  as  the  Stosser 
Diskmag, Stosser Multimedia text displayer, and the Commercial/freeware 
release 'H.E.R.O.'..

As  one of the great survivors on the very influential STOS  subculture 
part of the UK Atari scene which has produced several games, demos, and 
especially  diskmags,  Tony is a H.E.R.O.  head and shoulders above the 
rest.. When many others abandon to the PC, Tony announces he will carry 
on, many nice things have come, and are still to come from this fellow. 
Well here he is, in his own words..
 

Hiya Tony, how are you doing?

  I  am  doing extremely well thank you,  things  are  looking  up,  for 
instance I have just read your intro to this interview and I was amazed 
to  find  out that I make Demos?  this is especially  suprising  as  I 
normally have a distinct dislike for Demo's ?

 I also find I have aged quite considerably? If I am fifty-odd  then I 
am looking well for it.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Your full name, yes, even the embarrassing middle bit..

 Anthony Ronald Greenwood,  Schoolteachers and Magistrates are the  only 
peeps ever to call me Anthony, even my parent's call me Tony. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Date  of  birth  and  other biographical  details,  favourite  type  of 
electric current etc..

 I am in my Thirties and that's all your getting,believe me that's a lot 
more than I  tell most <smile>

(Born  on  the 1.8.1956..  Work it out for yourself..  Well you blabbed 
your date of birth all over the Stosser Web Pages! - Ed)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


What is your computing history pre-ST..

 The same as everyone else I expect, yes it was the good old speccy 128+ 
the grey model, not the bug ridden black cased effort, An Atari 800XL as 
well.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

And  what  motivated you to get one of Mr Tramiels  grey  wedge  shaped 
box type things..

 From reading the Spectrum magazines I was enthralled with the idea of a 
disk drive as opposed to the dreaded tape recorder.  I could not  afford 
the  add  on for the spectrum and again from reading the adverts  I  was 
leaning towards upgrading the whole machine, I nearly bought a Sam Coupe 
but  thankfully could not at the time.  I eventually decided on an Atari 
because that was all I  could afford.  I have to wonder if the  Spectrum
Magazines contributed to the demise of the Speccy, the machine had to go 
eventually  but  did  they speed up  the process by showing  what better
things were available?

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Describe your current interests on the ST..

 Programming of course. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What forthcoming attractions are about to spring forth from the twisted 
mind and talented hands of Tony Greenwood..

  Hmmm by the time you read this then my current project will have  been 
released,  however the seed of an idea is there for another  game,  this 
will be released at the forthcoming Atari shows at the end of September. 

   There have been many attempts at platform games on the ST,  but  they 
have all been very slow and hard to get past the first stage affairs.  I 
am going to make the fastest and largest play area platformer ever  seen 
on  the  ST,  I say the fastest.  I am not saying it will  be  the  best 
platformer  seen,  but  it will be a very large play area that  you  can 
speed around,  it will be simplicity to play,  yet annoying enough to be 
addictive,  think of Sonic, think of speed, think of special effects and 
you have the same idea as me.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


How  did  you  get  involved with STOS,  and end up being  one  of  its 
lifetime heroes..

  It was on a cover disk,  I was fighting a losing battle  with  Hisofts 
First  Basic  and  informed that it would cost a  small  fortune  for  a 
compiler, then along comes STOS on a cover disk and I was impressed. 

   After  reading  and  trying everything in the  Manual,  I  was  at  a 
standstill,  what  next?  Has anyone else got STOS,   so I sent  a  free 
advert  to  ST User magazine asking for STOS  contacts,  Wow!!!,  I  was 
inundated with letters from all over the world,   a lot of letters  were 
from  Demo crews wanting "screens",  well at that time I  couldn't  even 
make a scroller,  and I disliked Demo's even in those early days,  but I 
gained quite a few valuable contacts that are still here to this day. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


What is your favourite thing ever programmed by yourself..

 That's easy!  MultiPlayer Pakman.  

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


How  do  you think STOS compares with other languages  (GFA  basic,  C, 
Assembly, for instance..)

  Ho  dear,  you surely don't expect me to say STOS is the  greatest  do 
you? This looks like a loaded question, but here goes anyway.
 
  All languages have the good sides and bad, for my personal use STOS is 
the best,  a language is usually judged on the speed it can carry out  a 
task, but how fast do you need to print your name on the screen? 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What do you think of 'language snobbery',  that is, people who sneer at 
STOS as an 'inferior' language..

 Now this does wind me up,  .....  When STOS first appeared,  it was  so 
easy to make a game that everyone tried it,  there was some real rubbish 
made.  The  PD Libraries have a lot to answer for as they  accepted  all 
this tripe into their libraries, wrote a description of it, and 8+ years 
later they still stock the title with the same description,  people  buy 
it and laugh at STOS. 

 Read my article in this issue of Maggie and you will see that STOS  has 
been upgraded.
 
 Everyone who says STOS is crap are talking through their behinds,  they 
are  commenting  on  the "old" STOS and do not realise what  it  is  now 
capable of. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


What limitations do you feel attach to STOS, and how do you think these 
might have been overcome, or need to be overcome..

 At this moment in time I see NO limitations at all to STOS. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


What do you think the impact of the new Generic STOS Fixer will be..

 Well this is the final piece of the upgrading jigsaw,  it will not make 
any STOS program look better ,  but will allow the resulting programs to 
run on any TOS version and finally do away with the "Not TOS 2.06" tag.
 
 Actually the Generic fixer has now been made totally redundant,  a  new 
fix  has  been  released for the STOS compiler,  all  programs  will  be 
automatically  fixed to work on all tos versions as soon as you  compile 
the program. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 
What is your assessment of the whole 'H.E.R.O' project,  why did it not 
do as well as it could have done..

 OK I have been looking forward to this question, it gives me the chance 
to at last tell the truth to more people than I have had the chance to.

 Bob Goodfellow and I started the project as simply another game.  I was 
at  that time  in  regular contact with Victor Wright  of  the  late  ST 
HANDBOOK  magazine,  he  saw an early demo of the game  and  offered  to 
release  it as commercial.  He promised to advertise it with  full  page 
spreads  in the magazines,  get it on a cover disk and get it  previewed 
and  reviewed,  We immediately gave Victor the copyright to the game and 
were both sucked into the whole commercial idea.

  Victor  Wright did everything he promised,  he did  full  page  colour 
advertisements  in  Atari ST Review magazine,  half page adverts  in  ST 
Format,  he got H.E.R.O.  on the ST Format cover disk,  it was previewed 
and  reviewed,  for  six months time,  you could not pick  up  an  Atari 
magazine  without seeing a screen shot of H.E.R.O.  Victor  Wright  made 
promises to me, and he kept them. 

  Due to the failure of ST Handbook magazine,  Victor went bust, he owed 
money here there and everywhere,  H.E.R.O. was just about to be released 
when Victor had to pack it all in, as part payment for debts outstanding 
he  passed over the copyright of H.E.R.O to AWF Public  Domain  Library, 
this is when everything went sour.  ANDREW FERN was the guy running  it, 
he finally released H.E.R.O and after three months of  sales,  including 
the  run up to Christmas and all the advertising done by Andrew and  the 
excellent reviews and scores,he tells us H.E.R.O. has sold a grand total 
of  40  copies.  #80.00 was made,  please remember there was two  of  us 
sharing everything 50/50, that's half for me and half for the artist, we 
thought maybe the next payment would be better,  on phoning Andrew  Fern 
about H.E.R.O. sales he informed me that 4 copies had been sold, a month 
later he said a total of 2 had been sold ( ever heard the saying that to 
be  a  good liar you have to have a good memory?  )  suffice to  say  we 
received nothing more and Andrew Fern became unobtainable, he conned us, 
ripped us off, he is a liar and a thief.
 
 So  Bob  and I decided to release H.E.R.O.  as  freeware,  sod  it  we 
thought,  let's get it out to the public,  we had to lose the intro  and 
sampled  sound  effects to get it on one disk,  but at least we  got  it 
released. 

   I  have always considered myself as a Public  Domain  author,  I  was 
overwhelmed  at the thought of releasing a title as  Commercial,  but  I 
will stick to producing free software from now on.
 
  Let me re-state that Victor Wright was in no way to blame for anything 
bad that happened regarding H.E.R.O as he did everything he promised  to 
do,  he took a chance and came through for us,  circumstances forced him 
to hand over the copyright, Andrew Fern of AWF then ripped us off. 


Feel up to naming any guilty parties!
 No problem, just did mate <grin>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Diskzines,  could  you  tell us a bit more about your long  association 
with STOSSER..

  As stated earlier,  I ran an advert in ST User magazine for  contacts, 
the simple idea of a diskmag came from all these new contacts having the 
same  problems as me,  where do we go for help, where's the support  for 
STOS,  always one to get involved rather than simply look. I suggested a 
diskmag and away it went, I thought up the name and I made issue one all 
on my lonesome,  everyone liked it and away it went,  I did not envisage 
it getting to issue 25 over 2 years later.
 
  NOTE!  I stopped running STOSSER after issue 18,  Bob Goodfellow  took 
over for a couple of issues then promptly disappeared never to be  heard 
of  again (still a mystery).  I carried on making a new shell for  every 
issue of STOSSER to issue 25, then the now editor Deano decided he would 
let  someone else make a shell for issue 26,  and for the first time  in 
the history of STOSSER we not only had a shell by someone else, but also 
a shell that wouldn't work,  well it would if you had an STe but nothing 
else,  the  idiot  who programmed it made it STe only.  I know  this  is 
bitchy of me, but had they stuck to my shells.............



And other activities on this front,  the issues of Warp, and the latest 
efforts on behalf of ST Plus..

 Yes I have no idea how this all happened,  all of a sudden I am  making 
diskzine shells for most of the diskzines released on the ST,  this  was 
not my intention,  but was very gratifying, when you make a game you get 
no  feedback  and  have  no idea  whether  anyone  is  actually  playing 
it,  but  a diskmag shell and you know people are using  your  software, 
they may not notice who made the displayer,  but it is getting used  and 
that's the most important thing from a programmers point of view.

  Keefy  was my first ever contact on the ST and as such is  my  longest 
standing contact,  he is a trekky or trekkie, I am NOT! But he started a 
Star Trek Diskmag and wanted a shell,  but with something a little extra 
added  and was not bothered whether it went over half a  meg, the  first 
issue was so well received that it spurned us onto better efforts.

   ST Plus,  If I remember correctly,  The editor started by  using  the 
diskzine construction kit I had recently released,  I was impressed with 
his  efforts and on speaking with him,  impressed  with the way  he  was 
taking  ST+ and I offered to enhance and personalise the shell,  it  has 
sort of snowballed since then. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Any new features to be added to the Stosser multimedia text  displayer, 
probably the best ST text displayer at the moment..

 You are far too kind,  you little liar you <grin> I can't see it  being 
the best, but......anyway.
 
 There is a fine line between a displayer that can be used for  instance 
for a diskmagazine, and a multimedia displayer, I already have a version 
of  a  displayer that can display video footage and play  sampled  sound 
etc,  there are no limitations! What I would like to see is someone with 
the  bottle to produce a diskmagazine with a low  resolution  displayer, 
only  a 40 column affair I know, but think of the 16 colours,  think  of 
full colour pictures scrolling up with your text, what joy!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What are your views on competing hardware, ie, the Amiga and PC..

 I think the PC is miles better than the ST,  only a fool would say  the 
ST is better,  I have played games on the Amiga and they easily outshine 
the corresponding game from the Atari,  the Amiga has the same games  as 
the Atari but are somehow better?

  But  I got rid of the Amiga and I got rid of my  PC,  they  sit  there 
gathering dust while I type away on my ST, I am a programmer, it is that 
simple,  I  don't like programming on the Amiga because of the  way  the 
screen is set out.  I have no intention of attempting to program on a PC 
as there is no room for the amateur "bedroom" programmer on a PC,  it is 
far too commercialised,  other machines are better than the  Atari,  but 
for my needs, for my hobby and for my pleasure, none of them can beat my 
ST.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What, in your opinion, would be an ideal replacement for the ST..
 
  Why on earth would I want to replace my ST?  I will in the  future  be 
getting  another  PC,  this would be for compatibility  reasons  for  my 
children re: school work. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What do you think of Atari's other hardware, the Falcon and Jaguar..

 The only games I play are on the Jaguar,I do not usually bother with ST 
Games and rarely play the Jag,  but if I want a blast or get the urge to 
kill something then I use the JAG.  I have the normal Jag,  an  imported 
Jag  that runs 16% faster and has no borders,  and a Sega   Mega  Drive, 
three consoles?,  all will go when I get another PC as the games are far 
superior, that is not the Jags fault, its Atari's. 

 Falcon...ho dear,  should I answer this one?  The Falcon is a brilliant 
machine and I have had the good fortune to have used one for a  weekend, 
the  biggest  buzz was being able to use the exact same  software  I  am 
already using, but seeing it in a higher resolution and in colour and in 
3D,  great stuff.  But I will not be getting one as the platform is  too 
small,  there  are  not enough of them and not supported  enough,  I  am 
talking  major support not itty bitty support,  getting a  Falcon  would 
mean  deserting  the ST. If I got a Falcon I would immediately  get  the 
Falcon  STOS extensions that allow true colour sprites and  full  stereo 
sound on interrupt, I would be in programming heaven,  but no one on the 
ST would be able to use the software.
 
Look at all the people who have got Falcons,apart from yourself and your
involvement  with Maggie,  you will find most have actually turned their 
back on the ST, show me a programmer who is making stuff for the ST on a 
Falcon,  yet when something is released on the ST you can hear them  all 
moaning  "but it doesn't work on the Falcon" course it  bloody  doesn't, 
does your software work on our machines? 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We recently saw you on the internet, you ran the STOSSER World Wide Web 
pages, now it is no more, can you tell us what happened..

 The usual?  money.  It wasn't that it was costing too much in the sense 
that I couldn't afford it, I could, but I was feeling guilty as a family 
man  at  the  amount of money I was spending when  only  I  was  getting 
anything  out of it,  so I stopped.  The internet and especially the BBS 
systems are brilliant,  the NEST message network is worth a modem alone. 
I would advise anyone to try it out, so long as you're not as daft as  me 
then it won't actually cost you much, 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

And  in  view of Brutish Telecom phonebill  inflation,  should  someone 
shoot Bob 'annoying little twerp' Hoskins!!

  You  obviously never watched "The Long Good Friday" one  of  the  best 
films I have seen and starring the little twerp,  you wouldn't mess with 
him.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What do you think of recent traumatic events at Atari and Atari World..

  ATARI the recent take over or demise or whatever,  well has any ST  or 
even Falcon owner actually noticed a difference?,  I haven't, things are 
exactly as they where before,  it has not  affected us as ATARI were  as 
good as non-existent anyway.
 
  ATARI  WORLD,  this was the saddest news of the year,  a  great  great 
shame.  I  won't comment on the quality of the mag,  but  I  have  never 
believed it to be good to have only one magazine.  I like ST Format  and 
fully  admit to reading it,  but I would have loved to have  seen  Atari 
World survive.
 
  A thought must go out to Andrew Wright and the rest of the team,  they 
took a chance and it failed, but at least they tried, at least they made 
the effort and at least they took that chance.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What do you think the future is for Ataridom..

  I see it staying as it is and as it has stayed for some time,  a  very 
slow  decline,  it should be here long enough to see us out,  but if  ST 
Format pack it in and there is no magazine left,  then that for me would 
signal the end.
 
   The whole ATARI scene lives on the public domain shareware  platform, 
at the moment programmers have an incentive, without monetary gains then 
why  does  a programmer program?  For me it is to get a  review  in  the 
magazines  or  maybe even an appearance on a cover  disk,  this  ensures 
people see you have made something,  even if its a bad review,  it shows 
you are there and recognised.

  What incentive is there to make a game and send it to a public  domain 
library,  and  never  hear  anything again?  Never  see  it  advertised, 
reviewed,  six-twelve months or maybe two years work,  just disappearing 
into  the  system,  a programmer needs incentive,  sorry but  your  work 
disappearing and never knowing  whether anyone  runs it or even likes it
is a killer.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

How could it be made better for everyone..

  By releasing Maggie every month...
 
   Seriously  I believe there should be an ATARI  diskmagazine  released 
every month,  written by the people for the people,  no film reviews  or 
rock albums or Star Trek. Just Atari stuff, it can be done, Maggie, ST+ 
STOSSER and any other serious diskmag all join together with a few of us 
guaranteeing to write something every month,  and have it ATARI only, it 
would  take off well.  Ictari,  wrinklies and all the other clubs  could 
join  in,  the latest AEO could be on disk,  an ATARI only monthly  FREE 
diskmagazine available to everyone from anywhere, I see that as a viable 
option.  

Cheers.............!ynoT

Phew, that's a lorra lorra work to do, see you soon tony - Chris..

 How come you get a capitol letter in front of your name?

(Just a hasty typo mate!! Besides, its the editor's perogative thing in 
action again! -  CiH..)
