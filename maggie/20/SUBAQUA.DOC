                       A watery kind of thing..

This is a strange little game written by Digi Tallis, aka John Lewis of 
Digi  Tallis  Developments..  This can be best described as a  kind  of 
pocket  version  of 'Virus',  the Dave Braben 3-D classic of  early  ST 
days..

The novella story thing is a bit more intelligently written than usual, 
and  simply  and  plainly  concerns you as the  defender  of  a  watery 
treasure  house  of rare minerals trying to stop  various  'Freeminers' 
from stealing these from under your employers nose..

Success  in this respect accumulates money which then pays for  various 
slick  ship  upgrades  to produce a faster,  more  lethally  responsive 
killing machine to earn more credits, an ever-spinning wheel etc..

To  look  at,  the game presentation is neat and sparse with  an  intro 
sequence  slightly reminiscent of 'Damocles'..  The main game menu is a 
series  of  neat blue 3-D bas-relief style text panels which  tell  you 
where  to  get  your  ship  upgrades  (Scooters  Ship  Upgrades!)  Your 
statistics,  an  impressionist  painting  'map' sort of  thing  of  the 
terrain,  and of course a button that launches you into the watery dark 
yonder..

To  look at that bit of the game,  there are some tiny 3-D polygons,  a 
wedge  lump that is your ship,  and a bunch of 'Thargoids' that are the 
Freeminers..  The  seascape uses a novel and nice 3-D Fractal  dotscape 
system, seen in quite a lot of demos, but never in a game before..

Control  is  mainly  mouse driven,  with left and right  buttons  fully 
involved,  directional  control  at the flick of a mouse,  up and down, 
well  that  is fairly obvious too..  Collision with the seabed must  be 
avoided,  as it can be painful,  permanently painful perhaps! A scanner 
on the right hand side of the screen tells you what is where, and if it 
is trying to get you.. Sound keeps to the sparseness of the rest of the 
presentation,  and  is  limited  to spot effects of a  very  functional 
sort..

The  gameplay  is one of those 'love 'em or hate  'em'  control  method 
jobbies   reminscent   of  'Virus'..   Actually,   it  is  a  bit  more 
straightforward  than Virus,  as the player does not quite have so much 
to  do in terms of the mechanics of the flight simulation..  This  also 
limits it quite a bit in comparison with that game,  to be honest,  and 
you are limited to a few run and random blast manouvres, which are made 
tricky by the fact that you do not see the bad guys until the very last 
second in the small playing area..  With the limited variety of enemies 
and  weapons,  the appeal of the basic game quickly fades,  and you are 
left  with more and more of what essentially is the same thing..  Which 
then  quickly wears thin..  The mouse responses for turning the ship in 
particular,  seemed  to be a little bit 'sticky' and difficult to  work 
out  which  way you should be pointing,  and by then it is too late  to 
line up on an enemy..

This  game does work on the Falcon,  if a little too fast for the 16mhz 
provided,  then  everything  turns into a bit of a blur..  The game was 
written on a very standard STFM,  so should work on just about anything 
else..

I would have liked to say that I loved this little game, but I can't as 
there  is  not really a lot to it..  Trying out some of  the  upgrades, 
faster ship,  better torpedos,  etc,  does add a bit more excitement to 
the basic game, but I can't see a long term appeal unless more is added 
to it..

Ratings:-

Graphics:-  75% - Sparse but very well drawn  status/background  stuff, 
tasty Fractal dotscape, main game on the small side..

Sonics:-  25% - Not an attempt at being viciously harsh,  but a  rating 
appropriate  for  the small involvement of the sound chip,  limited  to 
some spot effects, no music..

Playability:-  68% - The game engine works pretty well,  but just lacks 
that 'one more go' factor..

Overall:-  70% - A nice effort that could have done with a  little  bit 
more to do in the main game..

(From   the  same  author)  Watch  out  for  'Killthings'  the   rather 
interesting sounding 'Doom' Clone for the STFM!
