                            [ A DEMO BY HYDROXID ]

This review is a  bit  late.  Actually,  quite  a  lot  late  and  I must first
apologise to all those nice  French  chaps  from  OH- who have been complaining
about its non-appearance. Any later and we'd  start making ST Format look up to
date.

RoD (as it shall henceforth be known) arrived  on my doorstep almost a year ago
during the middle of the Reservoir Gods 1995 convention. We loaded it up and it
promptly  crashed.  Attempts  to  load  it  on  all  the  Falcons  present  had
unpredictable effects - it seemed to  just  display a "DISK ERROR" graphic when
there obviously wasn't a disk error. Still it  was nice to see that someone had
gone to the trouble of drawing the logo.

After a bit of hacking through the  code  we discovered the problem was that it
needed memory. Humungous  amounts  of  memory  infact.  I  coded  a reset based
autoloader for the specific purpose (see  the now legendary "God-Load", used by
literally two people all around the  world).  If  you  want to run this demo, I
strongly advise that you get hold of this program.

Right, so the memory is free and your MShrinks stop grumbling, the demo can go.
It begins, as is traditional, with a  logo. This an exceptionally nice rendered
hyrdoxid logo displayed  in  high  resolution  (interlace).  This  stays on the
screen for some time whilst  all  the  relevant  data  is loaded. It then waves
goodbye with a smooth fadeout, the music kicks in and the demo begins.

In case you were in any  doubt  of  the  origins  of this logo, the next screen
informs you in the conventionally unsubtle  way. Yes, its the tricolour (that's
the French Flag, Windows-95 users!). This is made  up of lots of dots and has a
nice sinewave distortion effect on it.  This  wibbles about the screen shouting
"We are French. Everyone else is bastards". Probably.

A RoD logo scrolls on.  Some  bubbles  float  up  the screen, these distort and
magnify the background. A similar effect can  be  seen at the end of EKO's "Are
You Experienced" demo. The background picture  is  a little dark so this effect
doesn't come out quite as  well  as  it  could.  Still,  I'm  a big advocate of
bubbles in any form.  You  can  make  great  games  them,  for example (..snip!
Blatant product placement removed. -Ed)

Another logo informs us  that  this  is  a  new  production.  Which is a pretty
pointless thing to say, as every production  is new when it is released, unless
the programmers have some sort of time  travelling facility. You could say that
this message is Tautological, which reminds  me of another game... (snip! Anti-
puzzle-game-Ed). Besides, this production is no  longer new. It would have been
cool if the demo checked the Falcon's clock, and after a certain date displayed
"An Old Production" logo, and eventually  "An  Antique Production - Hugh Scully
Take Note."

We now have one of  the  highlights,  at  least  in  the  comedic sense. Yes, a
picture of a muscular men wielding weapons  scrolls on.  He is also wearing the
tightest trousers known to man.  Perhaps  they  are  de rigeur amongst the high
society in gay Paris, but they really do bring a tear to the eye. No wonder the
muscly bloke has a large grin on his face.

An Intel Inside logo is now displayed. Just when you are starting to worry that
your computer has transformed into a Pentium  and you are calculating the money
you will have to spend "upgrading"  it  every  week,  a warning siren sound and
someone starts taking pot shots  at  the  logo.  A  the gun shot sounds, bullet
holes appear in the  logo  -  nicely  done.  Once  the  logo has taken critical
damage, a "Motorola Inside" flashes on. Nicely done, our kid.

Another  picture  appears,  this   one   informing   you   that  there  is  "No
Mapping/Gouraud (Not Yet)". If all  demos  had  to  detail all the effects that
weren't included then we spend more  time  reading lists than watching effects.
Unless it is a Lazer demo of course, in which you age four years by the time it
ends.

So, here we are, eagerly anticipating the non-gouraud, non-mapping effects. You
are hoping for some non-fire effects,  and  some non-star tunnel effects too as
these have definitely become cliches amongst  the  demo scene. You will be both
happy and disappointed.

Another effect  that  makes  an  unwelcome  reappearance  is  the  old spinning
bitplane circles. You know the one.  There  are  some circles that rotate about
and when they overlap they create  a  new  colour.  Since  we last saw this old
chum, he seems to have  aged  badly.  He  is  not  quite in the retirement home
shouting "DRINK! GIRLS! ARSE", but he  is  well  on  his way. The thing is that
this effect doesn't run in a frame all  the time. The arthritis must be playing
up.

We are now presented with a great  piece  of graphics drawn by Nitrik. A single
polygon face spins and rotates  over,  eventually  expanding  to fill the whole
screen and another good picture scrolls  in.  Our  old  pal, the circle (son of
sine and cosine, a close relative of Pi) appears, but seems to be going through
puberty as all sorts of unsightly body  hair have sprouted from him. The circle
zooms in as the spikes around it do  a y axis rotation. Quite a straightforward
effect, but nicely done, and quite original too.

The next picture is probably the best in the  demo - it is a fantastic image of
an underwater city.  It  looks  very  smart  indeed.  The  fading  out  is also
exquisite.

Remember the no-mapping/gouraud? Remember the non-committal to "no-startunnel"?
Well this is why. Yes,  its  a  star-tunnel.  Perhaps  it  has gone so far past
cliche that  they  are  being  ironic.  Somehow  I  think  not.  This  isn't  a
particularly bad example of a star tunnel (or Dottus Maximus as they were known
by the Roman civilisation that created them) nor is it a particularly good one.
It is in a repetitive loop and you  don't  really feel like you are flying down
it. Roll on the next effect.

Here come the "greets",  the  section  of  any  demo  that  is most despised by
magazine writers, so it can't be  that  bad.  Hydroxid  have put more effort in
than most in this section. The greets rotate and spin down the screen, there is
a spline with a bitplane trail  and  rastered slimer type thing. Thankfully you
don't have to read all the  greetings  every  time  you watch the demo, you can
simply press space to get to the next section.

The next effect is one of the  best  in  the  demo.  It is a sort of jelly-dot-
polygon (cue baffled silence). Let me  explain.  The  polygon edges are made of
blue dots, but they are not  straight  line  -  they have some sort of sinewave
distortion through them. They  leave  a  trail  of  polygon dot lines of lesser
intensity. Very nice. The only thing that spoils this effect is the bugs in the
dot drawer when the objects  reach  the  left  side  of  the screen (a clipping
error?) were random dot lines seem  to  be  displayed. Otherwise full marks for
this nice little effect.

Some more conventional 3D shapes are  now  displayed.  Yes its the 3D cube, but
this time its nice and big, although its size doesn't really compensate for the
lack of colours. Yes, its just  flat-shaded,  but the faces are lightsourced. A
3D triangle shape then appears, again the faces lightsourced. This isn't really
cutting edge in these days of phong  shading and environment mapping, but its a
start.

We have another picture - this time it  is a Manga style image. Even though the
picture is small, the screen is  set  into  interlace  mode - I suppose this is
"design". Nice picture though.


The next screen looks very nice -  but that's because it has been pre-rendered.
An animation of texture mapped spaceship spins  round - obviously created in 3D
studio. Anyone who remembers the superb "Overdose" demo by Aggression on the ST
will have seen a similar screen. Still, it looks smart.

We now have a new module as the end-part has descended on us. Here we have some
slimers, some graphics in  the  background  and  some  scrolling one plane text
giving us information. If you are sneaky you  can type in a code here to access
the hidden screen. And no, I'm  not  telling  you  what  it  is, but it will be
revealed in a future issue of maggie.  Lets  just  say it has been mentioned in
this article!

After the credits have finished, a blue sinewave distorting scroller scrolls up
the screen giving you lots of  useful  information. This is effectively the end
of the road if you don't know the code.

The hidden screen is a real delight. It  is  a chance to wallow ear-deep in ST-
based nostalgia. Yes, its a collection  of  top  tunes  from the cheery days of
yamaha sound. And it is testament to the skills of those old musicians who made
that ungainly lump of metal  sing  like  a nightingale (erm.. Over-The-Top-ed).
These tunes are better than at least one  of the modules featured on this demo-
FACT! The screen itself has  a  sinewave  distorting  hyrdoxid logo at the top,
some hardware scrolling text in the  centre  which  contains all the tunes, and
three rastered volumes bars at the bottom. ST city!

The tunes themselves come courtesy of David "Whistling" Wittaker, Count "Famous
Parents" Zero and Big "Don't Mention The  War"  Alec. And they are all corkers.
Well  most  of  them.  Wittaker  bleeps  through  such  classics  as  "Menace",
"Speedball", "Weird Dreams", "Cosmic  Pirates",  "Obliterator"  and the comicly
misspelt "Warth Of The Demon". Count 0  hits us with some banging tunes, whilst
techno uberlord Alec opts for the timer a based SID-voice cuts. Rinsin'!

OK, it's sentimental and if you never  owned  an  ST you will just scratch your
head in bewilderment, but for those  of  us  who  remember the demos and intros
that used these tunes will be crying with joy.

So there we have it, Hyrdoxid's  first  major  Falcon demo. It is obviously the
work of old ST coders - a lot of  effects  look like ST ones just tarted up for
the Falcon, just like the early DNT-Crew  demos.  It is saved by some wonderful
graphics, good presentation and some nice tunes. None of the effects, taken out
of context, are stunningly impressive, but as a whole the demo works - it seems
to become more than just the sum of its  parts. It is a worthy debut, and shows
potential.

With Realm Of Depth, Hyrdoxid have clambered  into  the shallow end of the demo
creating pool, but they have every intention  of  forging their way to the more
challenging deep end. They are definitely a  crew  to keep your eye on, as they
should be soon be near the  top  of  the  table challenging for the demo making
crown.

If you haven't got this demo yet,  it  is  well worth splashing out for it. You
must sea it! It is shore to  be  one  of  your favourite debut demos! This demo
really made waves when it came  out!  Ooh crikey water scorcher! (That's enough
crap water based puns. Ed.)
