                            SENTRY 96KTRO
                            =============

It is quite a while since  we  last  heard  from the Dutch coding team
Sentry. Their first  Falcon  demo  featured  some  zooming true colour
graphics. They also coded a packer, which  was one of the first to run
properly on the Falcon.

Now, in true LFO style, they are back, and they have made an 'advance'
of sorts.

The demo kicks off with some truly  bizarre music, which is at least a
little different from your standard  4  channel mod these days. Sentry
declare themselves with a badly centred logo  at the top of the screen
and a 3D object appears from  the  bottom of the screen. This features
phong-shading (Windows 95 users-do try to keep up!). This is a shading
technique similar to gouraud shading but  it allows highlights to fall
at the centre of polygons, not just  at the vertices. It gives objects
a more rounded appearance.

Phong-shading was also featured on  the  Geranium  demo (see Maggie 19
for a full review) and the object  featured here is not as detailed as
the ones that appeared on Geranium. Still the phong shading works well
and it is technically the best effect on any of the 96ktros.

The phong  shading  disappears,  and  a  box  appears  on  the  screen
containing a strangely familiar picture which zooms and scrolls about.
If you are feeling a strange  sense  of  Deja  Vu then this is because
this is exactly the same effect  that  sentry  used on the first demo.
Before they get a chance to  do  a "sentry-packer:the demo screen" the
96ktro ends.

The credits screen switches into  a  high  resolution  and some of the
text is cut off, at least on my  monitor  so I don't know who coded it
or composed the music.

Overall some technically very good  effects, but presentation needs to
be improved and it would have been nice to see a new effect to back up
the admittedly impresive phong shading,  otherwise  it just ends up as
Phong Kong Fooey.
