I liked this fancy ascii front end so much,  I decided to use it in our 
review of the Dead Hackers Society prizewinning demo.. We 'borrowed' it 
from  the textfile that came with the demo,  so we hope that DHS  don't 
mind too much after all..  Anyway, on wit' de show as they say (in some 
parts of the world..)

'Demolition'  first  came to public attention at  the  Xmas  Aggressive 
Party  coding convention,  held in Finland..  It indeed managed to beat 
off  other  Falcon  and PC opposition to win first  prize,  and  we  so 
proudly announced the result in the previous issue of Maggie..

The  demo was described by some sources as 'unlike anything  ever  seen 
before'  which did sound interesting..  We were led to expect something 
very large indeed,  and with a large emphasis on the audio part of it.. 
Expecting to see something in the weeks after the convention, we had to 
wait rather longer than that before the end result finally turned up..

(One  possible consequence of the delay was that DHS had to  give  back 
their first prize as the Agressive Party competition rules were  fairly 
keen to enforce a tight time limit for release date.. Eeeek!!)

First  contact  with this three disk chairbuster puts it in  the  'Lost 
Blubb'  class  for  largeness..  A fairly easy to  follow  installation 
procedure  follows,  until  we  try to copy the final disk  which  then 
throws  a  wobbly somewhere in the middle tracks,  which actually  then 
turns  out to be the *first* disk in the sequence,  so Felice has to go 
home  and bring a fresh copy on non-duff magnetic media..  That  little 
problem out of the way,  the demo auto-depacks and the only casualty is 
another acre or two of hard disk space,  but hey,  what did I spend all 
that dosh on hard disk storage for in the first place, eh?

Running  the demo is nice 'n easy,  just a click of a mousebutton,  and 
away..

The  demo  starts  up  with a converging title  screen  effect  and  an 
ominious rumble which heralds the soundtrack..  After some voiceover in 
the  manner of the war in Vietnam 1964-75,  the proper music blasts  in 
with the first of the effects..  This is a series of 3-D polygons being 
squirted  across the screen Grotesque style which fade off as they  are 
going,  and if you were looking at influences,  grandparents etc,  then 
the  Grotesque  Demo  is a valid place to look..

Next is a twisty tunnel thing which is neither made of dots or  texture 
mapped, but instead of hundreds of lines, predominantly blue and white, 
which  the observer flies down forever,  or until the next part of  the 
demo comes along.. 

The slightly cheesy ST'ish effects are relieved by some very  colourful 
screens  that can only be expected on the Falcon as a  semi-transparent 
screenful of rotating coke cans plays over a ghostly background  piccy, 
and you start to think, hang on, Lost Blubb!

We  are  back  to  the acieeeed!  zone when a bunch of  clip  art  with 
attitude hijacks the monitor flashing up in double quick time..  A very 
nicely  executed  motion blurry pair of hands twirls about  the  screen 
next, and these with a flower sharpen into focus very briefly, as if to 
remind  you  where this demo hangs out..  A gratuitious topless  'totty 
shot' pops up in a tantalisingly 'too brief for a proper look' fashion, 
and  then  straight back into the next bit which is a sort  of  reverse 
greets  screen  with fiery rippling letters describing  what  the  Dead 
Hackers Society hate.. Another nice and blurry truecolour background by 
the way..

DHS  are  so keen on the 'coke-motion screen' they decide  to  give  it 
another showing, only more ripply and swirling than the last time.. All 
too soon we are into the final screens for the demo, as some hand drawn 
logos appear, the music shuts off, and we are booted back into the cold 
bus station of real life..

Ratings..

Graphix:-  88% - Some very nice truecolour screens alternate with  some 
leftover STe polygons and acid flash pics ,  which are still ok, but oh 
so STe'ish..

Sonix:- 93% - Yaah!  Rad,  kickin' and just plain loud.. This accounted 
for  the bulk of the demo,  and may well have been a sound file  played 
direct from disk..  No weak and shoddy modfiles for this production, no 
siree!!

Gee  Whiz:- 80% - I'm not too sure how this demo got its 'unique'  tag, 
as  there are two distinct styles of past demo fighting to  escape  the 
sack,  namely  the techno heritage of 'Grotesque',  and the more recent 
style  of  truecolour fancy video typified by 'Lost Blubb'..  It  could 
really have done with a few more effects..

Overall:-  85%  - A nicely put together production if somewhat  on  the 
short side and unfocused.. A case of 'more is better' here..
