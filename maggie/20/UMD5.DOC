                           by Michael Noyce


The  PHF have done it again!  Here is another collection of music  from 
various ST and Amiga games and demos all mixed together and released as 
"UMD5".  Sadly,  this  is the final ST project (*) from the PHF who are 
moving  on.  "UMD5" is basically all the stuff they had left over  that 
hadn't made it into any of the previous Ultimate Muzak Demos.

Almost  immediately  after  booting the demo  presents  a  screen  with 
details  about  how to contact the PHF and a  big  (almost  obligatory) 
Intel  Outside logo.  Next is the intro screen proper featuring the PHF 
logo  blasting  onto the screen in a very FTL-esque  style  -  remember 
"Oids" and "Dungeon Master"?

The  main menu for the most part consists of a raster bar  effect  with 
pulsating blocks that form various messages and characters.  Across the 
bottom of the screen are the buttons:  [<],  [UMD], [>], and [End Seq]. 
Clicking the mouse on [<] and [>] selects the musician whose music  you 
want to hear and clicking on [UMD] enters the tune selection screen.

The  tune  selection screen lets you select and play  individual  tunes 
using  the usual video style buttons.  The top two thirds of the screen 
consist of some text and a VU meter type display.  The bottom third has 
a nice interference type picture (where lots of circles are overlapped) 
that  flashes  and  cycles different colours in  time  with  the  music 
resulting  in a really nice effect.  If flashing lights aren't you kind 
of  thing  by choice or for medical reasons then you  can  toggle  this 
effect  on  and off by clicking on 'Yikes' at the bottom right  of  the 
screen.

There   is  also  a  digital  department.   After  a  few  credits  and 
information,  which  can be skipped past with a quick stab of the space 
bar,  you  can  select to hear tunes (mods?) from "Amberstar",  "Lethal 
Xcess",  and "Jim Power".  This section is supposed to be STE enhanced, 
not  that  I noticed any stereo sound or crystal clear  samples  coming 
from my STE. Hmm...

Clicking  on the [End Seq] button on the main menu enters  the  credits 
and  greetings screen.  First you see several digitized images of  'The 
Faces  Behind  The PHF' (which stands for The  Pyscho  Hacking  Force), 
namely:  Cal, Johnny 99 and Grazey. The credits and greetings scroll up 
the  screen  over a hand in siloette against  a  pulsating  psychedelic 
backdrop.

In total there are 88 tunes,  a bit down on previous efforts, including 
the  music  from  the main menu,  credits,  and the Bonus Calsoft  Dots 
screen.

Conclusion

My first impression wasn't exactly one of wild praise and enthusiasium, 
a case of nothing new and seen it before, but it's grown on me a little 
more.  I guess it's okay but nothing really special that will blow your 
mind or anything else (OO-ER!). Still worth getting hold of it though.

Greetings  and  thanks to Grazey for getting in contact  with  me  once 
again  and sending me "UMD5" and various other stuff without my  having 
to even ask!

(*) I've been told that the PHF might be releasing "UMD6" which will be 
a  compilation  of  all the tunes from the previous "UMD"  demos  on  a 
single   high-density   disk.    All the   tunes   will   be   selected 
from one menu, e.g. there'll be a composers menu, game menu, demo menu, 
etc.  For  example,  you could select the "Union Demo" and hear all the 
tunes or select Mad Max and listen to them from there.
