                           CORSAIR PREVIEW
                           ---------------

Swedish group Impulse - responsible  for  the  "Bugs From Outer Space"
Fried Bits 3 Demo - are busy working on a game for the Falcon030.

The game is called "Corsair"  and  is  based  on  an old game from the
Commodore 64, but as has become  traditional,  it has be polished up a
lot, with the addition of true colour graphics and stereo sound.

The  game  itself  it  a  two   player  shoot-em-up  set  in  a  space
environment. In can be played  in  solo  mode, but main coder Longshot
doesn't advise this. He tells Maggie  "One single player can of course
try to survive  the  first  attack  wave  on  his/here  own  ... But I
wouldn't bet a single fish on the odds ... "

I didn't know that Ladbrokes accepted fish as currency these days, but
I think we know what he means. This seems to be a team game, where the
spirit of co-operation is essential.

Even though you must help each other if  you really want to get a long
way into the game, you  can  shoot  the  other player for extra score!
(But don't expect to him to be happy about this!).

As well as the standard weapons, there will be a set of bonus weapons.

Each level is distinct from the  previous  one, and has its own theme.
Longshot explains. "We have a Sokoban (Impulse/ICE game. See Maggie 19
-Ed) level, where you are attacked by  Bobby the Hippie Ghost! Also, a
classics level with old  style  flying  saucers  (like  in Plan 9 from
Outer Space)."

It sounds a lot of fun. This is no straightforward, boring, regimented
shooter, it has a  lot  more  surreal  elements  to  it. In essence it
sounds a lot like a Jeff Minter release, which can't be a bad thing.
As Longshot puts it: "The game is  supposed to be humorous, with silly
samples and odd enemies. Perhaps some  certain  fished will do a guest
appearance?"

Ah yes, but will they say NIIIIIII???!!!!
