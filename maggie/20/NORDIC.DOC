
                  Very late arrivals at the Newsdesk..

It  has  been reported by a reliable source that Sony  are  selling  off 
Psygnosis!!  This was seen on the local television news in the Liverpool 
area.. Good bloody job too we say!!

Also,  according to a report on Radio 5, Escom are closing down anything 
up  to sixty high street stores because of 'Poor Performance'..  Readers 
of Dirk will note that they have sold off their interest in the Amiga as 
well, and we leave you to form your own conclusions..

A  stop  press  (stop disk copier?) release of the  Nordic  Atari  Show 
results..  Working copies of the demos concerned should be with us very 
shortly,  I've already seen the ICE effort, and it was very nicely done 
indeed if a little on the short side..  Nice to see you back guys,  and 
more please!! - CiH -  late June '96..
