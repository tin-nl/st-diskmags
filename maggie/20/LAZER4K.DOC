                             LAZER 4KTRO
                             -----------

The idea of Lazer doing  a  4Ktro  is  a  bizarre enough concept. Most
Falcon users have Lazer demos taking up  about 98% of their hard drive
space (94% of this being Lost Blubb!)  and we are used to huge amounts
of effects and  sprawling  8  channel  tunes.  This  is  somewhat of a
departure.

Enlisting the help  of  Lucky  of  Inter,  the  mastermind  behind the
stunning "Terrorise Your Soul" 96ktro, was  a very good idea. Dropping
any ideas of doing full motion  video  type  effects was also a pretty
smart move.

So the demo starts with some white dots on a black screen. You realise
this is a starfield, only of the static variety. Then suddenly -WOOSH-
(my sound effect,  all  4Ktros  are  strangely  silent) two spaceships
whizz past. Only they are 3D.  And texture mapped! Yes texture mapping
in 4K - you'd better believe it.

There is a whole story  with  ships  attacking other ships, some stray
meteors and space stations being  blown  up.  The starfield also moves
(although not very smoothly).

OK, so the textures used  aren't  wonderful (try fitting nice graphics
in 4K) and the starfield rotation  is  a  bit jerky (but then the sine
table is generated by the program  using a not 100% accurate equation)
but the overall effect is pretty stunning.

Squeezing this whole thing into 4K  is  a bit of a miracle, apparently
Energizer had to rewrite parts  of  the  packer's relocator to squeeze
out some extra bytes and final file size is exactly 4096 bytes!

I don't think this demo won the  competition, but I think it should of
done. It combines contemporary  demo  effects  which compactness and a
plot. I'm just waiting for the first texture mapped bootsector intro!
