                               A Preview

I've just seen the future of Falcon gaming and it works!!

'Running'  is  the follow up to the rather promising  'Doomino'  96ktro 
seen  last April at the Fried Bits III..  Doomino was a concept of what 
was  possible  to  do  on  the  Falcon,  but  it  did  not  permit  any 
interactivity,  and  was merely a demonstrator of a 3-D engine for  the 
Falcon,  one  of  so many that appeared in a very early form  and  then 
crashed back to obscurity when the programmer lost interest.. 

The appearance of 'Running' at the Symposium this April was one of  the 
pleasanter  surprises  of the trip..  We have the quiet heroes of  Stax 
Developments  to thank for this,  who have laboured away for a year  to 
bring 'Doomino' right up to date..

Running  has  moved  several stages further on from  that  initial  3-D 
engine..  The  basics  of a fully featured Doom style game are  now  in 
there,  with a neatly drawn status panel,  a first person viewpoint gun 
(borrowed from Duke Nukem!) and REAL BAD GUYS!

The  game  demonstrator  is a good example of that genre,  as  the  3-D 
update  is smooth and fast (unlike certain early efforts) and with  the 
borrowed  'Doom'  texture maps and bad guys,  rather looks the part  as 
well..  There  are some compromises to keep things moving on a standard 
16  mhz '030,  as only the walls are textured,  the floors and ceilings 
stay flat shaded, and if that is what it takes to keep the game smooth, 
then I suggest that Stax leave that exactly that way..  The bad guys at 
this  point  in  time are easy to kill without  undue  harm  coming  to 
yourself, but that is a mere detail.. 

Mention  has  to  be  made of a  rather  excellent  overhead  view  map 
function,  which  is very well drawn and can be 'walked' through in  an 
identical  manner to 'Doom'..  There are also continuous sound  samples 
through  the  game,  with a looped dripping sound,  and the usual  door 
groaning open, kabooms and screams that go with this sort of game..

There  is  still  a lot to do,  and at Symposium,  Stax  reckoned  that 
another  six  months  work was needed before the  game  was  finished.. 
Certainly,  several  things  seem to be pencilled in,  as an option for 
multiple  weapon types is on the status panel,  but not here yet..  The 
other  major 'things to do' include level design,  more bad guys  (MORE 
PLEASE!  and  tweak  that  difficulty level) perhaps  a  few  different 
textures,  and will there be a modem/midi link deathmatch option so you 
can  beat up on your friends??  However,  most of this is fine tuning a 
working  game  engine,  and at this stage,  everything looks  extremely 
promising..

The  point  is that a fully playable and viable 3-D  'Doom'  engine  is 
possible  on the Falcon,  and with some adjustments to the gameplay end 
of things, it will probably be THE release of 1996 for the Falcon..

Stax  are to be congratulated for getting this far with it..  Buy  this 
game as soon as it appears!!

Full review to follow in future issue of Maggie..
