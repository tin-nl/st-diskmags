          DISK MAGAZINES: REVIEWS FOR A NEW GENERATION

              (Numerous paper-saving publications)



Atari Explorer Online
Volume 4 Issue 8 - October 10th 1995

Although it's more of a Newsletter than a magazine, AEO is a long 
established  and popular production.  The editors of  this  'zine 
have gone for the single text-file approach;  a whole 161k of  it 
in this particular issue.  Most would agree that this is best for 
a production that is essentially destined to be circulated online 
(ie. BBS' and the 'net). Shell programs and freebies are okay for 
whole disk affairs, as we might as well use the full potential of 
the disk's size. It's no  good having a disk-based  mag that only 
makes uses of 50% of the <>800k available.  But when saving phone 
bills is the name of the game,  as with AEO, all these extras go. 
This is  in the aid of the smallest file size possible. The  text 
is what's important anyway, and AEO is certainly  not  lacking in 
that department.

The  first  thing  that hits you even just  skimming  though  the 
endless text is the amount of 'insider' knowledge these guys have 
about Atari and the software developers. You can easily tell that 
the  US  based  editorial team are  devoted  enthusiasts  of  the 
highest  degree.  It good to have a news source from  people  who 
=really= know what they're talking about.

What a news source it is too! They cover all Atari news, not just 
the Jaguar side of things,  even though this is their main  focus 
(and Atari's too!). It's definitely the first place that everyday 
users  will  find out about Jaguar games and  other  US  software 
development.  It's  a pity if you've only a Jaguar and no way  of 
displaying Ascii though!  Then again, we never know what hardware 
may grace the Jaguar in the future..

The magazine does eventually reach the PD libraries, but the next 
month's issue is normally out by then. Unless you are online, the 
news  will almost definitely be old news by the time  it  reaches 
you.  Online distribution is top notch though. You can get a copy 
of the latest issue in many ways,  either through online services 
like GEnie and Compuserve,  by subscribing by EMail or from  most 
popular  bulletin  boards.  If you don't have an  EMail  address, 
many UK BSS's have AEO onboard.

The multitude of Jaguar material could cause the cautious  reader 
to  cast an immediate wave goodbye,  but this would be a  foolish 
move  as  there is still a wealth of 'all  machine'  constituents 
mixed. It has to be said that Jaguar articles consumes a good 75% 
of the mass,  but a quarter of 161k is still quite a bit of  text 
(don't expect me to calculate the amount at this time of night!). 
Besides,  the  reams of Jaguars previews and reviews are  a  good 
read,  even more people who steer well clear of the Jag.  One  of 
AEO's  big plus' is the great talent of the editorial  team  that 
are behind it.  The writing style and humour make for a  gripping 
reading  even of topics that would normally be irrelevant to  the 
particular reader.

Having all their routes of contact within software developers (or 
maybe they just attend a lot of shows?) enable the team to  bring 
us previews of Jaguar games months before their releases. Some of 
the games previewed in the October issue have not yet emerged  at 
the time of writing (Christmas). This kind of time gap emphasises 
that  AEO  is  essential if you want to  know  about  forthcoming 
software releases.

The regular columns in AEO are also well written and informative. 
They range from Internet news,  press releases, and short reviews 
columns  by outside  contributers  to 'In the pub...', a  general 
news  column  from  the UK correspondant  Iain  Laskey  and  'The 
unabashed Atariophile'.

A  good  review  in the 'Unabashed Atariophile'  column  that  is 
relevant  to  all  TOS computer owners is  a  review  of  Richard 
Karsmakers'   Ultimate Virus Killer Book.  The particular  writer 
rates  the  book rather highly,  unlike  some  particular  glossy 
mags..

Another  of  the  brighter  sparks  in  Vol.  4  Issue  8  is  an 
interesting article on how to start up a user group - the correct 
way.  It  goes  through just about everything you would  need  to 
consider when starting up a group, including how to advertise and 
get material on the internet, etc.

Apart  from the huge lean this publication has towards  both  the 
Jaguar and the US scene, it must be said that AEO is an excellent 
route  to  insider information,  and essential to anyone  who  is 
serious  about  their  Atari..  Even those who  are  off-line  :)  
Eleven out of Ten, and counting...

ST News Volume 10 Issue 2
By Richard Karsmakers and Associates

This  is another in the series of 'handicap' reviews that  covers 
most reviews in this issue.  My 'reviewing' computer  (STfm,  TOS 
v1,  started  life as a TOS-on-disk machine!) has just about  had 
it's day.  Currently the power light initiates,  but the  machine 
fails  to  boot  at all,  leaving me only one working  ST  in  my 
posession.  The reason that this is a 'handicap' is because  with 
only  one machine,  studying the review material and writing  the 
review  at the same time becomes impossible.  If the one  machine 
was  capable of Multitasking,  it *could* be done,  but  only  in 
theory,  as  the way Richard has chosen to  code  ST  News  makes 
multitasking with it impossible also.

It  is very astounding that this issue of ST News has  graced  me 
with  it's presence at such an early date.  The official  release 
date  was November 25th 1995,  and here I am writing this on  the 
4th of January '96. Usually these foreign productions do not land 
on  my doorstep for a least a few months.  Maybe all my  contacts 
have a pact to keep me in the dark for a while :)

Well,  what can be said.....?  Lots, actually! The uniform way of 
doing things is still present, with even the same desktop.inf and 
so on.  No changes to the shell (is there ever?),  but what could 
possibly  need  changing?   It's  very  functional,   smooth  and 
professional looking.  Articles appear under the same  categories 
as  usual,  but that doesn't stop there from being  an  excellent 
range of original and extremely readable material.

An  interesting  opening is made by the  dedication  article.  So 
often  in the past the dedication has been made to the  'biggest' 
of the rock bands being interviewed.  Issue 10.2 is in the memory 
of  a certain female virus author from the former Yugoslavia  who 
became a close friend-by-email of Richard.  Mr Karsmakers had not 
made  his relations with this girl public before hearing the  sad 
news  of  her recent death,  probably a  suicide,  provoking  the 
dedication in ST News. It is indeed a very touching story.

Interviews... The only computerish interview of the issue is that 
held  with  Dave Mooney,  the former editor  of  ST  Enthusiast's 
Newsletter  (STEN)  disk  magazine.  Questions put  in  the  best 
possible  way  by  Richard are let down by  ironic  answers  from 
someone  who  has  crossed the fence to hell  (the  PC),  and  in 
so doing  has  become a rather more sour character  than  before. 
Hardly  what I was expecting from the ex-editor of such  an  epic 
publication.  At least it shows what the PC world can do to  you. 
Take my advice - stay on the Atari! Other interviews consist of a 
couple of non-Atari related persons, so I skipped these out in my 
initial browsings.

A  welcome  return  to ST News,  is  that  of  the  Disk Magazine 
roundup.   It's  the  fourth  'version'  and  contains  over  150 
publications,  also  now  including  Skynet  Times.  It's  really 
astounding how many Atari related 'zines there are, many of which 
most  people have never heard of.  This is just one of  the  many 
'listing'  articles that appear in every issue of  ST  News.  The 
Falcon  compatibility  list almost reached 4  figures  this  time 
round,  and the program versions listing is gathering bytes at  a 
great  rate.  The  usual Email address listing (of  Atari  dudes' 
addresses)  has altered with the addition of a WWW page  listing, 
compiled  by  Richard "Felice" of the  Maggie  team.  It  doesn't 
contain too many Atari specific URL's, but it's good nonetheless.

Magazine Compilation Issue (Best of Issues 1-11)
By the Maggie Team
Sifting through the old issues by Felice :)

Call it a legacy, a revelation of even a miracle (!), but finally 
the  long awaited compilation issue has been finished.  The  main 
'putting together' of the compilation is the work of  Felice,  as 
CiH  has been working hard on Maggie 19 (apparently).  It's  here 
nonetheless,  and here in great volume too!  It almost completely 
fills the disk, with no room for any extras. All files are packed 
as  usual,  and  I  tell you that there is  such  a  mountain  of 
material  in there that it takes ages just to browse  through  it 
all,  let alone read it in detail.  If you have this compilation, 
you don't need the early issues at all!

So, what's in there? Well, as you may have guessed, there isn't a 
Falcon  specific version of this issue,  it's just the old  Delta 
Force  one for all (even though that's the best ST shell  ever!). 
Basically,  all  of  the same menus are present as in  any  other 
issues of Maggie (Utils,  Demos,  Games,  etc.), but each menu is 
packed to its full (200 pixel) capacity with items..

There  must be about 15-20 reviews each the Demo,  Game and  Util 
menus,  along with show reports and such shoved into the non-used 
menus such as 'PD List',  normally home of the FOG PDL  catalogue 
and Skynet Times Update files.  The editorial has been written in 
the present tense (obviously), but there are some 'general' files 
from the older issues as well.

Okay, wannacopy??

Silicon Times Report no. 1201
By STReport Publishing

Another online magazine in a similar fashion to AEO. There is one 
slight  difference  though,  this one isn't  Atari  specific.  It 
covers goings on for PC,  Mac and Atari machines,  and the  Atari 
section (in this issue at least) is minute.

Yeah,  you've guessed it! It's really a magazine for your average 
ISDNing PC freak.  It has almost nothing for Atari users at  all, 
and  is really let down by it's presentation.  Even the most  un-
arty   person  on  the  planet  could  do  something   moderately 
interesting  with Ascii characters??  Obviously these  guys  lack 
flair, in a big way!

One interesting piece of Atari news of Ted Hoff's (US Atari Boss) 
announcement  of 'Atari Interactive',  a new part of Atari  Corp. 
This  is  to develop PC CD-Rom software and it's  Web  site.  Now 
they're  even moving away from (or,  giving up on!)  the  Jaguar. 
Predictable,  I  know.. This  is  most disturbing  for  us  Atari 
Computer  users,  as this new product focus just  about  confirms 
most people's thoughts that Atari will *never* be developing,  or 
following up,  the range of TOS computers (namely ST and Falcon). 
Let's hope C-Lab will remain loyal...:)

Definately one for a rainy day - and it has to be raining =hard=, 
OK :)   Actually, I'd rather walk the dog and dry off afterwards. 
Your opinions may differ, but that's mine..
