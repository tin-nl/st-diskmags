                            X-MOON PREVIEW
                            --------------

If there is one thing  the  Falcon  needs  it  is  good games. Here at
Reservoir Gods we try to do our bit  (e.g. Donkey Kong) and it is good
to see others hard at work  making  "entertainment software" (as it is
called these days I believe).

X-Moon is  a  vertically  scrolling  shoot-em  up.  If  you  have  any
preconceptions about this genre,  the  doc  tells you "It's different.
Just start and forget the rest." So we do.

After a while  watching  a  rather  unentertaining  black  screen, the
action begins. Or at  least  the  intro.  A  nice X-Moon logo appears,
which perhaps lacks a few colours but is nicely designed.

Some text appears telling  us  that  this  is  the "first night" which
seems to indicate they coded it in  one  day and have just released it
in the evening. This is patently not the case as I saw a preview of it
last year!

Next  we  have  a  lovely   diagonal   plasma  background  over  which
information is displayed. At the top  of  the  screen we have logos of
the various crews involved and  underneath  we  have  the names of the
members involved.  This  is  a  real  demo-scene-supergroup.  In music
supergroups rarely work (Electronic  being  a  rare exception) but the
team behind X-Moon seem to have gelled successfully.

The main coder behind X-Moon is Dragon  from  New Trend. This is a guy
who is always working on nice  games  but rarely completes them, so it
is great to  see  that  he  will  at  last  finish  something.  He has
previously worked on demos such as "Strange Circumstances".

The game concept  and  level  design  is  by  BDC  of  Aura  - the man
responsible for the excellent  early  Falcon  game LameMines, and also
the  "ex-illusion"  demo  which   some   people   thought  was  rather
prentitious but at least it tried to be different from the crowd.

The music is by Domm  from  Animal  Mine,  a  man  who has appeared on
various independent music  compilations  and  made  contributions to a
number of demos.

The graphics duties have been  shared,  but  the  majority of the work
fell on the more than  capable  shoulders  of Dan of Lazer. Additional
work is by the award winning Agent  T  from Cream and a guy from Moule
(or Fatal Design or Abstract or whatever they are called this week).

So X-Moon is a real scene  production.  This  is  either a good or bad
thing depending on your view of  "demo  coders who try to code games".
There are two schools of though on this subject:
"Those guys code such amazing effects!  I  wish they would could games
they would be brilliant!"
"Writing demos is one  thing,  but  writing  games  is whole different
skill and demo coders don't have the patience to create decent games."

This argument  has  raged  for  centuries  and  caused  numerous minor
skirmishes around outlying towns in Austria.  If we look at the record
of demo coders who make games it  is  a  bit mixed. The Lost Boys were
responsible for  the  appalling  "A  Prehistoric  Tale"  but  also the
excellent "Monster Business". TCB's  "Enchanted  Land"  was an amazing
technical  achievement,  but  perhaps  wasn't  all  that  playable.  A
recurring theme through  games  originating  from  the  demo  scene is
amazing presentation and technical  brilliance  but  lack of gameplay.
Let us hope X-Moon can redress the balance.

When you start the  game  the  first  thing  you  notice is the speed.
Everything is moving at a very  healthy  25  frames a second and there
are loads of sprites on screen. There  is  no slow down even when some
big sprites start attacking you.

The second thing you notice  is  that  the  game is hard. Bloody hard!
Playing one player I struggled to make much progress through the game,
but them I am no shoot-em-up ace  and  I'm sure fans of the genre will
have a lot less problems than me.

The in-game graphics are very  nice,  but not outstanding. The quality
varied a lot between sprites. New  graphics are promised for the final
version. I did enjoy the explosions though -  I am a big fan of bright
colours!

There are a whole series of powerups, some seem a lot more useful than
others but I didn't survive long enough to try them all out properly.

One big advantage of the game is  that it offers a two player version.
The game is  pretty  hard  so  is  probably  more  suited  to multiple
players. One let down is that fact  that you can't use joysticks. Here
at Reservoir Gods HQ we are  pretty  lucky as we have powerpads coming
out of our ears (a  rather  serious  medical condition actually) but I
know a lot of people without them  who will be frustrated at not being
able to play 2 player. Let us hope this is fixed in the final version.

On the whole the game reminds me a  lot of Wings Of Death, which is no
bad  thing.  It  is  also  a  lot  like  Cruor's  forthcoming  "Panium
Disaster", so there will be a  real  battle of the shoot-em-ups on our
hands soon.

X-Moon has got a lot of  potential.  The graphics and music are great.
The coding is also very good  with  a brilliant sprite engine. We just
hope they can get that mythical  X  factor into the playability and we
will have a shoot em up to treasure.
