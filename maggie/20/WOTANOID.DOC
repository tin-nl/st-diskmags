                           WOTANOID PREVIEW
                           ----------------

Wotanoid is a Falcon game by  French  coding crew "The Wotan Extremist
Group" (WEG) who were responsible for the 'game' Watership. This was a
game where  you  guided  a  little  dinghy  around  a  large  hardware
scrolling map in search of some axes (don't ask!). It was quite funny,
but not a very serious release.

Wotanoid, on the other hand, has  the  polish of a commercial release.
The graphics, sound and coding are  immaculate.  But what type of game
is it you ask? Well the 'oid'  gives  you  a clue (no, its not OIDS!).
Remember  Asteroids?  Blasteroids?  Megaroids?  Ateroidia?  Hemoroids?
(oops, how did that one slip in?). Yes, its an asteroids game!

There are plenty of options on  the  main  menu screen. You can change
the rate of acceleration, and the effect of gravity. You can play with
one or two players.  The  sound  options  are  great  giving you total
control of the  volume  of  music  and  samples.  You  can even choose
different mods! You can adjust the  screen  position too, if the videl
setting means it is not centred you can manually re-centre the screen.
This is a good touch.

Most the of the plot and  credits  information  are in French so being
the language idiot I am, I couldn't make any sense of them.

The game itself looks beautiful.  The  true  colour graphics are truly
brilliant - probably the best I've  seen  in  a game of this type. The
asteroids  themselves  spin  round  revealing  their  detailed  shaded
surfaces. They also bounce about nicely.

Everything moves around at a  very  sprightly  50fps, giving it a real
arcade feel. The craft are very responsive.

One of the main men behind this project is  Major X of EKO so it is no
wonder the game looks so great!

Wotanoid - probably the best version  of  asteroids ever. Oid buy that
for a dollar!
