So now you've seen what's in it, and the very favourable  ratings handed out by 
ST Format, why not give the disk-magazine a try?.  It's  Freeware,  so all  you 
have  to do is send me a disk and return postage for each issue  required.   If 
possible  I would appreciate it if you could put something on the disks  rather 
than send them blank, an article or review or two would be great!!.
