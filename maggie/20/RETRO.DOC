                       RETROGAMER

The other week I was skulking around HMV  looking to see if they had a
copy of "The Tin Drum" on video, and  yes, as usual they did not, when
I happened to stroll over to the computer mags section there. I picked
up a copy of Maximum which is what  I usually buy and went over to the
counter to pay for it, on  that  counter  was a small pile of fanzines
called Retrogamer. 

On the cover- "Bushnells' Baby, This man spawned an industry, this man
changed your life." complete  with four crap quality pictures of Nolan
Bushnell, founder  of Atari. I had a quick flick through it and on the
spur  of  the moment decided to buy it. It cost a quid. It is 16 pages
big. But, it shows potential.

Retrogamer seems to be  the creation of  one  bloke,  Keith Ainsworth.
It describesitself as the magazine of classic videogames, whether they
be  coin-op  console or  home computer. It is bi-monthly and I have no 
idea  whether you can get it outside the Liverpool area  or  not.  You
can  get it directly from the editor anyway,  the  address  is  at the
end of this article.   The general look  of  the  magazine  is  of the
"bloke  plays about  with desktop  publishing  software off a magazine
coverdisk and sticks in some clip art and then photocopies it" school,
but it does include some rare photos of game history  like  a  picture
of the "Computer Space"  arcade game  cabinet (this was the first game
produced by Atari, and not Pong as  most  people think).

Keiths' writing  style is very good,  as well as being informative and
well  structured  there's some stuff  I hadn't  heard  of  before, for
instance did you know Atari was originally called "Syzygy" Or that the
ghosts in Pac-Man never go up the top T junction above their pen?  The
one complaint I do have about it though is that there's not  enough of
it. Sixteen pages for a quid is a bit too "ST Format" for me, but this
is only the first issue  and it all  seems to have been  done  by  the
one bloke  (sounds a bit like ST Format now - Ed)  so I suppose we can
forgive this,  hopefully it will get bigger in time.

There's actually a "Help Wanted" note on the last  page,  so  I assume 
the magazine will eventually expand,provided enough people contribute.
So, will Retrogamer make it to  a  second  issue  or will it just be a
strange one-off lurking in the attic along with all those issues of ST
Format you forgot to burn? Er..Dunno.If you  want to get in touch with
