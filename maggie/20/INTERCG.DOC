Commodore 64

8 years approx.

  > What prompted you to join the Falcon Fact File? 

Contact with other Falcon owners etc.

  > What do you think of the Atari scene in general?? 

Pretty good bunch of guys ATM. Atari's gone but the machine lives on.

  > Which demo, in your opinion, is the best you've seen on either the
  > Falcon or ST?? 

Not really my thing. Very impressive but once you've seen one they're all
the same. But saying that there was one with fire texture mapped on walls
and stuff for the Falcon which I can't remember the name of which was very
good.
 
  > What is your local Atari scene like??? (user groups, shops, etc) 

Funny you should say that:) Me and a couple of others have just started
the Wessex Atari Group (WAG) for all Atari owners in the southern UK area.
Our first meeting is tomorrow. Anyone interested contact me or Roy Goring
at:- roy@gorring.demon.co.uk.

Nothing in shops anymore:(

  > Which computer show(s) do you have fond memories of? 

Alexander Palace where I met Jeremy Hughes. Novotel were I met Colin (FFF),
Neil O'nions, Vic Lenard and Ofir.

  > Have you ever been to any overseas computer parties at all? (Fried
  > Bits, etc) 

Nope. Wouldn't mind but haven't made it to one yet.

  > What is your opinion of diskzines on the Atari scene?? (ie Maggie,
  > DBA, ST News etc) 

The first one I tried was STEN which was very good. Tried ST News but a
bit heavy going. Then found Falcon Update when I got my Falcon then along
came Maggie and I was converted (what a creep:))

  > What is your favourite movie of all time?? 

Too many really to say but off the top of my head - Wizard of Oz, A Star
is Born, in fact anything with Judy Garland. Alien 1-2, Brief Encounter,
Forbidden Planet, 2001, If, Pulp Fiction etc.

  > What, in your opinion, is the worst movie you've seen?? 

Now this is difficult. What do you define as worst? Worst acting, worst
effects, worst story line? Some things like 50's sci-fi movies (Planet 9
from outerspace etc.) are so bad they're good. The worst I've seen is this
arty farty thing called 'Dandy' with Nick Cave. I won't go into why I saw
it but I wish I hadn't.

  > Who is your favourite actor & actress in the movies?? 

Actor - Clint Eastwood
Actress - Judy Garland

  > What do you think of the following subjects? 
  > (please be as frank as you like) 
  >  
  >  
  >  
  > Piracy 

When I first got a computer pirated stuff was all I had, now I buy things
like a good little boy:)

  > The Holocaust 

Did I miss it?

  > Censorship 

Be your own censor. Don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't watch,
listen to, read, write, say or do. Common sense really, use your brain.

  > The Dunblane tragedy 

Sorry don't remember it.

  > The infamous British tabloid newspapers (The Sun, et al) 

Scum of the Earth. Anything to sell their bloody papers no matter what it
does to anyones life.

  > Rutger Hauer (Movie actor & star of Guinness adverts in the past) 

Bladerunner - Brilliant, Guinness - Yuk!

  > The Coreys (Feldman and Haim) 

Sorry not my cup of tea.

  > If we were ever to visit you (ie, myself and CiH), where would you
  > take us for a night out?? 

I'm sure it would be an eye-opener;) You've been warned:)

  > Who is your favourite musical group? 

Too many to mention really. All time has to be T.Rex. ATM it's
Orbital/Underworld.

  > Who, in your opinion, is the worst musical group on this planet?? 

Has to be a toss up between Bon Jovi/Def Leppard. Or any shit heavy metal
bands.

  > Whose albums do you normally listen to from your own collection? 

ATM mostly Orbital/Underworld while I'm commsing but anything that takes
my fancy depending the mood I'm in. Anything from Opera to Reggae.

  > Thanks for your replies, Chris - hope everything goes to plan. 

Thanks, nice to talk to you:)

Chris
