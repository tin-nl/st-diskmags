     Well,  if  you  thought  that you had gotten rid  of  my  miserable 
     ramblings  after the awful moaning I provided you with in the  last 
     issue of Maggie,  then think again,  because I'm back, and I'm even 
     worse than usual.  So be warned....
     
     The  first  thing I'm going to moan about is the DSS,  or  is  that 
     DHSS?,  they  change  things around that often it's  hard  to  keep 
     track!.   Anyway,  as the odd one or two may know,  I am one of the 
     couple of million in this country that is occupationally challenged 
     (ie, I'm unemployed).  Rather than sit on my backside like a lot of 
     people would,  and do nothing,  I decided to put my name down for a 
     course known as Community Action,  a half voluntary thing where you 
     do  work for the local community,  and in return recieve  an  extra 
     tenner on your benefit.  Note the use of the term 'half voluntary', 
     I  say this because it is voluntary to sign on the course,  but  if 
     you sign off it again within a given period you lose benefit.
     
     Anyway, the placement I chose was at a local community centre where 
     I helped out in some of the computer classes,  a simple form, and I 
     was  on,  no  problems.   Six months passed,  and as this  was  the 
     maximum ammount of time allowed on the course,  it was time for  me 
     to sign off it again.  'Okay' I though '1 nice simple form and I'll 
     be back where I started from'.  No such bloody luck!,  first I rang 
     them up,  they tell me that I have to make a fresh claim to sign on 
     the  dole,  because  apparently for the last six  months  I  wasn't 
     unemployed,  despite  the fact I was still claiming all  the  usual 
     benefits  and  I  didn't have a  job.   Of  course,  should  a  job 
     opportunity  arise,  I was expected to give up this voluntary  work 
     immediately and take up the job... or... I would lose benefit.
     
     Next I'm told that since all of Coventry's unemployment offices are 
     closed  due  to strike,  all claims are being dealt with  by  post.  
     Apparently  Coventry is the only City in the country where the  Job 
     Centre staff are on strike (or so I am told.).  So, the lady on the 
     phone  tells me that she'll send me the forms,  5 days  later  they 
     arrive,  I fill them in, and send them back off, I then get a phone 
     call a couple of days later, saying I  should have had a  couple of 
     other forms as well,  five days later they arrive,  I fill them and 
     send  them  back.   Another  six  or seven days  later  I  get  the 
     acknowledgement that they've recieved them,  but still no money, by 
     now  it's about 6 days late.   I ring them up,  and find that  they 
     made  a cock-up and they'll send it right away.   Another two  days 
     later,  and the Giro pops through the door, only then it's only for 
     one  weeks money and not three as it should be.   So another  phone 
     call,  'yes,  sorry,  we made a mistake' and a couple of days later 
     the  right  money  comes.   I've still had to ring  them  up  three 
     fortnights running though because they've somehow forgotten to post 
     out my other giros.  
     
     At long last,  the Tuesday just gone, my giro was on time, I say on 
     time, it was actually a day early.  To say I was surprised would be 
     a major understatement.
     
     
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Complete change of subject now,  and onto football, it's been a bit 
     of  a strange few months for my team,  Coventry  City.   We've  not 
     played  a great deal of games because of the weather,  we  used  to 
     have undersoil heating at one time, but for some strange reason the 
     powers  that be decided to take it out a few  seasons  ago.   We've 
     only played a few times,  but now our pitch is looking like a ruddy 
     mudbath,  I've seen better kept non-league pitches.   Results-wise, 
     we're not doing too badly,  not brilliantly either, but at least we 
     aren't getting hammered all the time.   We got beat by the Hammers, 
     but we should have beaten them, got a decent result against Chelsea 
     too,  the form team of the division apparently?.   Or at least they 
     were until we beat them, because West Ham beat them today.  
     
     The cup was a bit of a disappointment,  not being able to beat  Man 
     City,  but that's the way it goes.   All the papers were harking on 
     about  some  stupid Manchester derby and didn't give  us  a  chance 
     anyway.   So we just gave them all what they wanted,  I doubt  that 
     the  BBC would have the match on live tommorow if Utd were  playing 
     Coventry.       

     Newcastle are still going pretty well,  some of their  performances 
     haven't  been  too  great,  but they're still coming  up  with  the 
     results when it matters,  to be honest I can't see any one catching 
     up with them now,  or at least I hope no-one catches them,  because 
     of the teams below then it's likely to be either Villa or Man  Utd, 
     and I can't stand either.
     
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     I've  been treating myself to quite a few nice little gadgets  over 
     the last months.   The first little luxury item I got myself was  a 
     nice modem.   I did actually have a modem once,  quite a while  ago 
     though,  it  was a 2,400 baud one,  and because of  it's  speed,  I 
     didn't  really try it out all that much on the BBS's.   In  fact  I 
     only  had it for a couple of months,  and sold it to a  friend  for 
     half the price I paid for it.   It might have been useful if  there 
     had been a BBS in my local call area, but at the time there wasn't.  
     Most of the time I didn't even manage to get past the main  menu's, 
     after a couple of minutes tinkering I would usually log off, having 
     achieved  nothing worthwhile.   Even so,  my phone bill after  this 
     short period of time was horrendous.
     
     You're  probably  wondering  why I bothered to  get  a  modem  once 
     again?.   Well,  the  number of my postal contacts has dropped  off 
     dramatically  recently,  there's  only  a  handful  writing  to  me 
     regularly now,  and most of them only write once a month.  I have a 
     feeling  that  a lot of this may be to do with the  postal  service 
     which seems to delight in losing my letters.   A lot of people  are 
     also moving over to the comms scene.
     
     This  I discovered when Tony Greenwood got himself a  modem,  turns 
     out  that  loads of people are out there doing their  Atari  thing.  
     So after a bit of thought I decided to splash out on  a 14,400 baud 
     modem for myself,  and after a bit of pestering, the missus finally 
     let  me get one.   Modems seem to be coming down in price  all  the 
     time now, and I managed to pick up an external fax/modem with power 
     supply and cables etc...  for only #90,  which I think you'll agree 
     is  very  reasonable.   The only down side was  that  the  software 
     supplied  with  it was for the P.C.   This didn't matter  too  much 
     though  because  I'd  already  asked Tony to  sent  me  a  terminal 
     program by post.   Within minutes of getting the modem,  it was set 
     up,  and  after  a while Tony and myself were  transfering  various 
     files to each other.  
     
     One  of  the things about the terminal software on the ST  is  that 
     it's very cheap,  almost all of them are either P.D.  or shareware, 
     so they cost you practically nothing.   There is the phone  charges 
     though,  so I'm to be very careful about how much time I spend  on-
     line.  Sometimes it's easy to get carried away.  At the moment I am 
     limiting  myself to a local BBS,  they have loads of message  areas 
     where  you can chat with people up and down  the  country,  because 
     these areas are linked up to other BBS's around the country.   Next 
     stop  for me will be the Internet,  once I've managed to figure  it 
     all out.

     Anyway,  not long after I got the modem, I annoyed the missus again 
     by  getting  myself  a Mega ST2  with  a  small  hard-drive.   Nice 
     seperate  keyboard so I can sit with it on my lap instead of  being 
     hunched  up  over a table.   The difference in  speed  of  loading, 
     saving and downloading files is incredible too.   I've also got  an 
     extra meg to play with now too,  which is great for when I'm  doing 
     my  STOS programming as I don't have to remove all the  accessories 
     and delete memory banks and stuff before compiling large programs.
     
               
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
     I finally bought ST Format for the first time in a while  recently, 
     it  wasn't that I didn't neccesarily want to buy  it  before,  it's 
     just  that round here for some reason it's been really hard to  get 
     hold of.   Anyway,  I asked a friend to pick up a copy in town  for 
     me, and for a change it was actually there, but dear oh dear what a 
     thin issue,  and #4 odd as well,  not very good value for money  at 
     all.   Atari World was a much better read,  but even so,  a  little 
     pricey at nearly #4 and that without a disk.
     
     
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The  Atari diskmag scene seems to have burst back into  life  again 
     recently,  ST+ has made an appearance with it's first issue,  which 
     for  a first effort was pretty damn good (at least I  thought  so).  
     I've  heard  that  the second issue is out too,  but  I've  yet  to 
     actually  see that,  I don't mind admitting that I'm quite  looking 
     forward  to  seeing it though.   Another diskmag that has  made  an 
     appearance  recently  is ST World,  I think it's around  about  its 
     third or fourth issue now?,  although I've only got up to issue  3.  
     This is another diskmag which is not too bad, both of the above are 
     monthly apparently,  so whether they will be able to keep producing 
     them I don't know.  
     
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Whilst on the subject of diskmags,  there were some amusing  pieces 
     in  Issue  19 of Maggie,  particularly the account  of  the  Maggie 
     party.   James L Mathews down in Sussex or whatever it was  because 
     he got on the wrong train or whatever it was. Is this entirely true 
     or could James not be bothered to turn up and so fabricated a story 
     to account for his non-appearance?.  I find it hard to believe that 
     that anyone could get lost in such a way as to not even know  where  
     they are. Actually I've been hearing a few strange things about him  
     lately, a couple of people who  have written programs for  his 'Top 
     Byte' label  have  apparently  not  recieved a penny yet  for their 
     efforts, and have  heard nothing from  him in a long time.  I'm not 
     going to say who they are,  but they are seriously p***ed  off.   I 
     know he's sold of his PDL,  and finished with Power diskmag, so has 
     he finished with Top Byte now ???.

     Hmm,  had a bit of a problem with my WP this morning,  after I  had 
     typed  a couple of paragraphs,  for some strange reason it  started 
     taking over by itself,  repeating stuff that I typed  earlier,  and 
     then freezing up completely.   This happened with Wordwriter 2, but 
     it has happened to me before with First Word.   It dosen't seem  to 
     happen  on one version of TOS either,  because it's  happened  with 
     1.2,  1.4 and 1.6.   Would anyone out there happen to have any idea 
     as  to why this happens,  I presume it must be a bug of some  sort, 
     and I'm sure it must have happened to someone else as well.  It's a 
     good  job that I hadn't typed much,  because before now  I've  lost 
     massive 50k docs, thankfully, I'd saved this previous, so only lost 
     about half a k's worth, still ruddy annoying though.

     Saturday's lottery draw came and went as usual,  and as per usual I 
     didn't win a penny.   Every week I've stuck a quid on,  but I still 
     ain't even won a tenner (boo hoo).   Dosen't help when you've got a 
     smarmy  git  like Anthea Turner staring at you  grinning  away  and 
     saying good luck etc.......  I don't watch the program now, because 
     the woman really bugs me,  am I the only one who hates her?.   It's 
     not  just because I've never won anything,  she's got that sort  of 
     face and voice and what-have-you,  sort of makes you want to  punch 
     her in the mouth.

     Today  is  the first day of the School half term  holidays  (or  at 
     least it is round here).   It's just gone midday,  and already  I'm 
     pulling my hair out and wishing they were back at school.   Why  is 
     that  kids  seem to play up a hell of a lot more in the  week  than 
     they do at weekends?.   It would probably help if the T.V. stations 
     had  decided to put something on the T.V.  for them to  watch,  but 
     there's  been absolutely at all on so far today.   Well,  I tell  a 
     lie,  there  were  a few things on Channel 4,  but  they  were  for 
     teenagers  not for 6-7 year olds.   Just a good job that there  are 
     such things as Cable T.V and video recorders, otherwise I feel sure 
     that over the next week we will be driven slowly very mad indeed.
     
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Had a little fun last night,  after several attempts, I finally got 
     to watch all of the first X-File (unopened file) video.   It's  the 
     one with the season two cliffhanger,  and the first two episodes of 
     season 3 on it.   I've been dying to see it for ages after season 2 
     finished on Sky.  I wish these T.V. programme makers wouldn't leave 
     us on the edge of our seats all  this time.   Anyway, this video is 
     well worth the wait, it's brilliant.  I'm also glad that I'd didn't 
     watch  it on Sky,  because I would have had to wait  another  third 
     week  to  see the concluding episode,  because the video  seems  to 
     feature  three  episodes on the one tape.   I'd love to  know  what 
     happened to all the other X-Files videos though,  they brought  out 
     four  of them,  then all of a sudden stopped  producing  them,  now 
     instead  there  are going to be these new ones,  which  are  in  no 
     particular order whatsoever.  It seems a little daft to me, because 
     I'm sure that if they released all episodes on video,  maybe one  a 
     fortnight,  they would make a killing.  Star Trek has been doing it 
     for  years,  they bring out about one a fortnight,  and  then  ones 
     they've mopped up as many sales as possible,  bring out boxed  sets 
     etc...
     
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Bit of a disappointing day yesterday,  I was settled down in  front 
     of the telly, hoping that Man City would beat Man Utd, but that was 
     not to be the case.  To be honest Man City didn't really deserve to 
     win,  but they should have had a draw. Even now, the next day, I've 
     seen the replays about a dozen times from about 50 angles (that  is 
     a slight exaggeration!) and I still can't see how in the hell  that 
     the ref could give a penalty,  that has to be one of the  strangest 
     decisions I have ever seen.   Even the Man Utd players thought that 
     a  free-kick  had been given to Man City,  and they were  all  just 
     about  to wander off back up to their side of the pitch  when  they 
     realised what was going on.  
     
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          
     I'm  not  sure,  but  I also think that  last  night's  episode  of 
     Spitting Image was the last one?.   I'm surprised that its been  on 
     as long as it has.   Why?, you might ask.  Well personally it's one 
     of the very few T.V.  programmes that I really like,  I think  it's 
     really  funny,  yet for some reason each series only seems to  last 
     about 6 weeks.  It seems that just as we get used to switching over 
     in  time to catch it,  it's replaced with something  else  (usually 
     complete and utter crap).   I suppose it will be something like the 
     South Bank Show or something :(.
     
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Well,  it  would seem that I have reached the end of  this  wibble, 
     unless  of course I manage to come up with any more rubbish that  I 
     might find occupying my head.  So for now, I'll say tatty bye.
