.....is the latest in a long line of Atari diskzines and although were 
new  I  think you will agree were  going  places....what's  that,  oh, 
that's  right,  you  can't agree because you haven't seen  the  latest 
issue have you, well, you know what to do, write in NOW for the latest 
issue,  all  I ask is that you submit something for inclusion in  ST+, 
you  can send in either a review of software or hardware  or  ANYTHING 
YOU LIKE!!, alternatively you can submit that picture you created once 
whilst bored one night,  whatever you want to send in feel free to  do 
so but please, ST+ IS submissionware so if you want a copy either:-

1,  Send  ME your submissions (along with a DD disk and  an  S.S.A.E.) 
at the following address.....

ST+
43 Spenfield Court
Lings
Northampton
NN3 8LZ
ENGLAND

or....

2,  If  you  would  rather  just have a  copy  without  sending  in  a 
submission simply send a postal order for 90p made payable to  G.Sykes 
and  request  ST+ by name (you will automatically be sent  the  latest 
issue) addressed to.....

LOCUTUS PDL
49 Summerfield Road
Wythenshawe
Manchester
M22 1AE
ENGLAND

...and ST+ will arrive through your letterbox shortly thereafter.

 Before you write off a little about ST+...

 The main aim of ST+ is to appeal to beginners and experts alike,  NO-
ONE is discriminated against because of their lack of knowledge, after 
all,  we all have to start somewhere,  besides,  I've had my ST for  a 
number of years and I'm still learning.

 The secondary aim of ST+ is to incorporate new AND old articles, just 
because  something  was  published a few years  ago  it  doesn't  mean 
everyone has seen it and believe me,  there are some powerful articles 
that  will  NEVER be out of date,  I like to think  that  every  Atari 
machine deserves a place in ST+,  be it Falcon,  ST,  Jaguar or  Lynx, 
even  the lowly Atari 2600 will alway's find room on the disk  (should 
anyone choose to send in any 2600 related articles).

 Aside from all the technical aspects of ST+ you will also find a wide 
range  of topics that freely invite your contributions,  are you  into 
Sci-Fi,  well,  Peter Augustin,  our resident Sci-Fi buff has his  own  
dedicated  section within the pages of ST+,  into music,  no  problem, 
Mike Gray is on hand to receive your latest Album and C.D.  reviews of 
your favourite artist(s). Do you want to increase your PD collection?, 
well,  every  month you have the chance to win loads of PD goodies  in 
our regular competition spot.

  Have  you ever wondered what the editor of  your  favourite diskzine 
looks like?,  well,  ST+ is the ONLY diskzine (that I'm aware of) that 
incorporates  pictures into it's text (and I don't mean ASCII  artwork 
either),  this  means your not limited to reading endless  text  files 
that  strain your eye's,  only with ST+ can you SEE what your  reading 
about without having to exit the text viewer to see 'A' picture.....

  There is so much to ST+ it would take around 780k to explain it  all 
to you, coincidentally that's just about the same amount of disk space 
that each issue takes up so what better than to request your copy  now 
and see for yourself but remember, ST+ is submissionware..... 

         I look forward to hearing from you - Dave Hollis.

      ST+ IS SPONSORED BY LOCUTUS PDL -- RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
