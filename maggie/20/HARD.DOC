Those of you who read the most hallowed "ST-News" may remember an
article by yours truely  on  the  subject of "Microsoft" entitled
"People Against Microsoft". Well  it  appears  that  I am not the
only one to dislike, and poke  fun  at Bill Gates and his demonic
little clan. So here are  some  ingredients that were thrown into
my e-mail pot and left to simmer  for 42 hours; meanwhile here is
a P.A.M. I made earlier (Get down Shep!).
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
On   with   the   show....Let us    extract   some   urine   from
Microsoft'swell full bladder.

Windows 95 a la Shakespeare


The  Usenet  Oracle  has  pondered  your  question  deeply.  Your
question was:

O great Oracle, the one who sees all and knows all, please accept
this humble question from thy grovelling supplicant...

Why is Windows 95  Beta  so  bug-ridden  it's  not funny?  And in
response, thus spake the Oracle:

THE SCENE:  A dark antechamber of  the Gates estate, dimly lit by
three 20" monitors suspended from  the  ceiling.  In the midle of
the room is a Pentium/100Hz,  sheathed  in a black casing.  Three
programmers dance around the  machine,  chanting horribly.  Their
pale, clammy complexion is  cast  hideously  by  the light of the
monitors, rendered even more repugnant to the watchful eye by the
60Hz flicker of the monitors.

FIRST PROGRAMMER:  Thrice the brinded net hath mewed.

SECOND PROGRAMMER: Thrice, and once the Warp-pig whined.

THIRD PROGRAMMER: MacHarpier cries.  'Tis time, 'tis time!

FIRST:  Round about the terminal go;
        In the poisoned upgrade throw.
        Code, which by a student done
        In minutes numbering sixty-one.
        Run-time error, protection fault,
        Crash ye first, crash ye shalt.

ALL [as they dance around the Pentium]:
        Double, double, toil and trouble;
        Tempers burn and data bubble.

SECOND:  Fillet of a Sound Card bake,
        In the Pentium no sound make;
        Point of arow, click of mouse,
        Scream of user, frightened spouse.
        OS/2's net use appeal,
        Steve Job's look and Wozniak's feel.
        For a charm of powerful trouble,
        Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL:  Double, double, toil and trouble;
        Tempers burn and data bubble.

THIRD: Click "Start" button, speed of slug,
        You would think you forgot the plug.
        Multitasking, ha ha ho
        If just one worked you'd be good to go.
        This should grab those straggling few
        Who aren't using DOS 6.22.
        Now we shall the Mac eclipse,
        While curse words cross our users' lips.
        Leave the errors in so we can fix
        And sell more...Windows 96!
        And so we will release the Beta
        For corruption of their data.

ALL:  Double, double, toil and trouble;
        Users buy, our profits double.

SECOND:  Compile it with errors through,
        Since the users have no clue.

[Enter BillGate to the other three programmers.]

BillGate: O well done!  I commend your pains,
        And everyone shall share i' the gains.
        And now about the program get,
        But NEVER use it on OUR net.
        Security is scarce put in.
                    [Beeps of PONG heard in the background.]
                    [Exit BillGate.]

SECOND WITCH:  By the usage of my UMBs
        Wicked Windows this way comes.
        Open locks,
        Whoever knocks!

[Fade to black.]

Remember, Obsolescence isn't an accident, it's an art form.

You owe the Oracle a  signed,  handwritten manuscript of MacBeth,
and a copy of the Windows upgrade for the P6.

Congratulations on getting this far, Did you see the episode of
"The New Adventures of Superman", the episode with 'Bob Fences',
an meglomaniac owning a milti billion dollar software house bent
on world domination. No similarity to Bill Gates what so ever?!?
