                          NEUROBOTIX PREVIEW
                          ------------------

Neurobotix  will  be  the  first   release   from  Dutch  coding  team
"Earchaeopterix Software" (what a  mouthful!).  It  is a platform game
that uses the Falcon's 256 colour mode.

I'm not quite sure about the plot  behind  this title, but you seem to
be some large robot bloke.  And  you  have  to  shoot things. Which is
always a recipe for a good game.

The sprites are pretty damn big  and  the  whole thing has full screen
scrolling. Although it is written  in  assembler, the frame rate isn't
terrific, certainly when compared to releases such as X-Moon.

The graphics also have a homegrown,  almost  amateur feel to them. But
this is part of the appeal.

The early version of  Neurobotix  reminds  me  a  lot  of 8 bit games.
You're not quite sure of what your  supposed  to be doing, but you are
going to have a lot of fun doing it.

Coder Pieter van der Meer tells us about his latest project:

"Neurobotix is finished for  about  75%  and  it  will be completed in
June. It's a  hi-tech  scrolling  platformer  in  256-colours. I coded
everything in assembler so its pretty fast."
"I am strong  believer  in  shareware  and  the  Atari  market. I will
release my game as shareware and  I'm planning on releasing more stuff
too."

I for one am very much looking forward to the release of this game. It
may not be as technically stunning  as some of its contemporaries, but
I feel it will probably be one  of  the most playable and fun releases
of the summer.
