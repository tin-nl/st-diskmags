  careful at computer parties, especially if there are thieving French Amiga
  lovers about! - ED )


                             ATROCIOUS AMIGA THIEF
                             ---------------------

                         The Hydroxid's Musician story!


The Tragedy ...


Let's begin  a non-nice story about  our  musician  (Killer) and a BIG "Bastard"
called ... (see later).

I (Arto/Hyrdoxid) heard  that  Adrenaline were  organising  a  party in a French
town called Valenciennes, so I  managed  to  buy  all  the train tickets for the
crew.

All was perfect, so we took the train at Saint-Lazare (Paris) to Valenciennes,
after a lame trip (with asshole ticket inspectors) we finally reached that city.
We phoned up the organizers and after 10  minutes, we saw them driving many cars
and after putting our bags into their  trunks  we climbed into their cars. Let's
go for a nice French Party and hope for a nice moment! When we reached the place
we met a lot  of French groups  such  as  Eko, Nlc, Ribbon, Avengers, ... so all
seemed to be perfect!

During the 2 first days, the party  was  nice because of cool moments, the sleep
rooms and the showers (look for  da  Symposium  96  party!). I was sleeping when
Jimmy (Killer) woke up me like a  hysteric  guy, I guessed that something really
important must have happened so I left my  sleeping  bag and tried to wear my T-
shirt and my shorts! He explained to me  that SOMEONE had stolen his computer, a
new one - Amiga 1200 (HD 540 MB  and  4  MB  of  ram)  so a good one in fact! He
worked hard to get it and harder to  pay  for his Hard-Drive. I was really angry
and we really felt the need to kill someone  - the thief! We asked for help from
the organizers but of course, they did not want to help us because they were not
responsible. Of course, we should take care  of  our  Computers. No, it is not a
joke but just the reality!

Then we tried to calculate the  how  the  thief  left and his identity. We found
that he might have left the party with  guys from Atrocity because they were the
last to quit the party after the Crime !!! The coincidence is that I know one of
Atrocity's member, Acrylic. When we came back  to  Paris, I called him and tried
to forced him to tell  me  the  truth.  He  said  that  he  did not know who was
responsible for the theft and that  he  did  not  see any Amiga Computers in the
car. He was right because he  came  back  by  train  so  he cannot have seen the
computer. I asked him the phone number of  a guy called Sgt Slayer, the next day
I received a call phone from Acrylic who had  some news of the theft. He told me
that he might have the name of the thief, of course he was not 100 % sure !!!

After a long chat, our doubts had  almost  vanished.  We learnt that a guy named
Norm of Skarla was riding in the  car  and  that  he had a computer (Amiga 1200)
when they came back to PARIS. The strange thing is that at the departure, he did
not carry any Computer! Right, the schemes began to appear in our minds. When we
were sleeping, he took the computer and left the party with the Atrocity's car.

During that period, we received a lot  of  phone  calls from lotsa people but in
particularly, Jack of Replicants. Being an old  Atari  user, he felt the need to
help us and to solve  himself  the  trouble.  But  why  ???  Anyway, he just had
complicated the story. So Jack,  PLEASE  never  try  to  control the events next
time, you are front of HydroxiD so ... We are not stupid bastards who are living
in a dream composed of  Coke,  Computers  and  Tv.  We  are able to control what
happen to our Crew.

Anyway, we contacted Sgt Slayer and asked  him  to  tell us the truth about Norm
and the Computer. He believed  our version of the events and agreed to go to the
Police Station. We prepared a  Rendez-Vous  at  Cergy  (near  Paris) and we also
decided to lodge a complaint against Norm.  But  of  course, he called us to say
that finally he can't join  us  at  Cergy.  Angrily,  we  went alone (Jimmy, his
mother and I) to the Police Station and we did it !!!!

The complaint flew to St-Denis Police (a  french Suburb near Paris) and one day,
Jimmy received a phone call from  a  woman  inspector who is responsible for the
file. She just asked  Jimmy to come to the Police Station. So we came too and we
met  Jimmy's Mother. The inspector was really nice, sympathetic and helpful! She
said that she recovered the computer  and  the  Hard-Drive,  anyway it was a bit
hard because of Norm's attitude. In fact,  she  called him at home and asked him
to come at the Police Station for an Interview. He accepted and she asked him if
he was responsible of the crime, the Amiga  theft! Of course he answered no, she
asked him again ! Always  the  same  answer.  So  she  explained to him they are
obliged to visit his home and to look for the computer. At this moment, he began
to panic because of his parents and the neighbours ! Perfect !!! He accepted and
started to leave the room but in the  corridor he really started to become crazy
and then he wanted to  change  his  declaration.  He  recognized that he stole a
computer at the Giga-Fun Party 95 and he explained that he needs one because his
brother also uses their single machine.

Funny !!! He did not  think  about  my  friend  and  his  reaction. All his life
disappeared in one night  just  because  a  bastard  needs  a computer!! How can
someone be so stupid ?? Everyone  knows  that  a  computer  is one the main life
reason and that stealing it is  enough  to  break someone. The inspector read us
the declaration and it was funny.

Anyway we would like to  "thank"  Adrenaline  and  Nlc  for  their help !!! Also
Atrocity for being so Lame  and  Unbrave.  Perhaps  they are afraid about Norm's
Reaction. You are Assholes, you don't merit to be on the Falcon ... Be sure that
if we meet Norm somewhere, you are going to hear cries and kick/fist sounds.
You should know that Major X/Eko coded  a  demo few time ago with them (Skarla),
sometimes it's hard to understand people !!! Norm is able to steal a computer so
perhaps he will restart soon!

Take care of your computer, and never give up ...

n'hesite pas a nous le faire savoir  !!  On  vous  reglera tous les deux en meme
temps ... une fois pour toute.
