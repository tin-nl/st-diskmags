You  should check out our 'Web pages sometime for some  major  bullshit 
about the main people involved in this publication..  We can out-wibble 
ST Format any day, we can!  Just check out the diskzine reviews to find 
out  where we are..  You even get horrid little portraits of us to gaze 
at..

This time around..

What  would we have liked to have done differently at the Symposium  if 
given the chance?

CiH..
I  was  quite  happy with the convention,  but  would  have   suggested 
another  event  to  the organisers,  a 'Shoot the  shuttle-bus  driver' 
competition!

Leon 'Pinky' O'Reilly..
Wanted   much  more  time  on  Tat's  Falcon..   unfortunately,   Tat's 
unconscious head frequently got in the way of the keyboard..

Felice..
He wanted more Weetabix, but there was none to be found there..

Kev of the Third Spare Cranium..
Kev  set his temporal displacement unit a year early,  and went to  the 
Fried Bits III twice instead!

Tash 'Sigourney Weaver Attitude-a-like'..
Would  have  liked  to have been there??  Several hundred  people  with 
deteriorating  personal  hygiene in one cupboard and next to  no  sleep 
gained as a result.. I think not perhaps!! 

Tat(ershall)..
Should  have taken a hollowed out PC tower case and slept inside  that, 
instead of using his Falcon as a pillow!

Mikey Noycey..
Mike would have very much liked to have been able to find out who stole 
his  food and make them drink the week-old bottle of milk that he  left 
behind at home on the table!

Kev the Taff..
Would  have liked to take home a copy of the German dubbed  version  of 
'Spiderman the Movie!'

Also Neil Jones-Rodway, who also attended with us..
Would  have  put  'Vote  for  me!'  subliminal  messages  in  the  demo 
competition!
