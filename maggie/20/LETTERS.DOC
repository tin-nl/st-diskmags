A mixed mailbag for this issue, with E-Mails predominating as the postal
system seems to have fallen into total disuse over the last few months..
Jiffybag manufacturers are weeping and  gnashing their teeth, I'm really
going to have to get a modem  and  get properly online soon, as everyone
seems to have an allergy to licking stamps these days..

I did get a postcard from  a  chap  in  Germany who runs the Subway BBS,
which was kind of nice of him, but difficult to reproduce in here..

Anyway we kick off with a quick letter about Maggie 19..


  Hi!!

   My first issue of Maggie was 19. And  i found that it is GREAT!! Nice
texts and some really good  articles,  and  last  not  least, it give me
feeling that out there still  are  Atarians!  THANKS FOR THAT!!  I would
rather prefer GEM browser (BTW i  did  wrote FOG shell). Or even better,
just to be  able  to  read  maggie  with  GEM  shell  ALSO  not ONLY! My
preffered settings do not allow to  read  Maggie,  and i must change the
res, and that is not  hm  "funny"  :)  BUT  ther  also MUST be graphical
shell, at least for first  impression  :)  AND  THANKS GOD, that someone
opens ASM school!! :)

  And here i come to my problem.  If  i  delete  or write files on my HD
(ext SCSI) in 256 colour mode, my  disk tends to freeze. (especialy with
blowUP on!). PLEASE do send me your patch!!


                                                Take care, Janez (SWE)

P.S Use this email:  jvalant@kekec.over.net

P.P.S  Please inform Tronic  that  i  lost  his  adrees  while little HD
crash, and send me his adrees (not email).

P.P.P.S AND I apologize for my English!

                        ------------------------------

This one from Mike James, talking 'Pure Bollocks' perhaps??


Hello, and first may I say thanks for the plug for "How To Code" in the
latest issue of Maggie! I  haven't  seen  the  review in the last issue,
because I haven't been able to get  hold  of it yet. I'm quite impressed
with the latest shell though.

As regards to your enquiry  about  a  certain other magazine immediately
after the plug, can I direct your  attention to my Atari scene WWW links
page     (http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/~mjames/computers/people.html)
which might help provide come answers....

Now a Senior Dads enquiry. Of course,  I should really be pestering Leon
with this, but I seem to have  trouble  getting in contact with him. The
main thing is that I've fiddled around with a truly awful French Falcon-
only demo to get it to  work  on  the  STE,  and I'm wondering what Leon
would think about it being released  as a "Senior Dads presents..." type
job.Could you possibly  get  in  contact  with  Leon  and  tell him that
there's a test version of  this demo on http://grelb.s rc.gla.ac.uk:8000
/~mjames / senior / test.html  Oh and if he's going to Symposium 96 (I'm
not- not quite enough money) and he's planning on doing a "senior" demo,
then, for the sake of continuity, he'd  better check out the Senior Dads
WWW pages!

Sorry for burdening you with all  that  there,  but if Leon has an email
addr, tell him to contact me!

Michael.

This one is an E-Mail  from  Rich  Karsmakers  to  Felice, with the more
personal bits  ruthlessly  butchered  out,  but  with  some  interesting
possible future plans from the creator  of ST-News, and likely Spin-offs
for ST-News after the final issue is released in July..


Felice:-
Regarding ST News, I know you said that both of the final issues will be
released on one HD disk.   Are  you  still  intending  to have the final
issues ST compatible or  not??   The  reason  I  ask  is  that  Del (D W
Stables) does not (yet!) have  a  Falcon,  just  his  STE  & STFM - but,
having been a fan of ST News for a few years now, he would still like to
read the last issues. Will it be possible to split them up and send them
on 2 DD disks??


Rich:-
There will be *one* more issue, Volume 11 Issue 1 and 2 rolled into one
(because I *do* want to make 42nd in  total :-), and it will be released
on 1 HD disk at the end of July  1996.  It will be sent out on HD disks,
but it will be A) HD installable  and  B) It will be splittable onto two
DD disks (albeit maxi-formatted, most likely).


Felice:-
I know that there will be no  more  issues  of ST News after this coming
July, but do you have any plans in the pipeline to release any 'Best of'
issues at all?? The reason I ask is that I particularly enjoyed a lot of
the articles over the years -  such  as Stefan's holiday articles in .2,
9.1 and 9.2 as well as  others  -  that I wouldn't mind seeing something
like this in the future.  What do you think??


Rich:-
The fiction parts will re-appear,  slightly  rehashed  as far as English
and spelling is concerned, in  "Twilight  World". Other than that, there
are no plans  whatsoever.  I  simply  don't  have  the  time.  I plan on
entering the WWW some day after the summer holiday, though, so I plan to
set up some kind of  Multi-Media  magazine  there. Nothing definite yet,
and actually this is the first time  I've ever written the idea down. It
depends on my getting Internet access, really, and time too. It will not
be an Atari magazine, at least not exclusively.

I plan to write the  odd  article  for  "Maggie", though.Chris said he'd
love me to.


Felice:-
As we are now all in  one  as  Magnetic  Interludes, we could even do an
issue of 'Best of ST News' using  the  Falcon 'Maggie' shell or even the
DBA shell for added excitement, couldn't we??


Rich:-
Sounds like an OK idea, but basically  it  would have to be initiated by
DBA or "Maggie". Just rip  out  the  articles,  and go ahead. I wouldn't
mind writing something new for  the  occasion,  but not before the final
issue of "ST News" has been released.

I hope April 8th  is  sort  of  definite  now.  I  am looking forward to
meeting you all, though, I have  to  admit,  I am not looking forward to
having to get up that early :-)

Bye for now, and send my best regards to all the guys I know (and some I
don't  :-)

Next,  an interesting follow-up to our scene news round up which we did 
for issue 19..  ADRENALINE ARE ALIVE!!  We are very glad to say.. Sorry 
for  giving the impression that this was not the case,  good luck  with 
the  coding party,  and hope to see more of your future projects on the 
Falcon and STe real soon!! - CiH (Ed)

Subject: ADRENALINE is staying alive !!!
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

                     Hi,


I'm MANGUE from ADRENALINE, the french demo crew. I uploaded the maggie
19 yesterday and I wonder why you have written  that ADRENALINE IS DEAD
?!?! We are working on many project (two demos (one falcon and one STE)
and a commercial game on  falcon) so I'm very surprised... I've noticed
that FLAN / EXA have  told  you some information and  I suppose that he
have said that ADRENALINE is dead.  It's false. In fact, FLAN was fired
from ADRENALINE in  april 1995. I'm not  good in english  (I supose you
remark  that !)  so I could  explain you  why.   But, some  members  of
ADRENALINE have decided to create a new crew: EXA. It's true; but those
members stay in ADRENALINE too.Only FLAN have quited ADRENALINE. So the
members of ADRENALINE is:
MANGUE - WHITE NINJA - RODGER - NEW FACE - ELENDIL - ELROND - PEGASE -
ZIGOMA - TWIX.

   We are very disapointed to know that you write a such false news .We
will organise a coding party in  france from 2 august to 6  august 1996.
You can read all information about this CP at this URL:

      http://www.ens.lifl.fr/~truttet and chose GIGAFUN '96.

Today  FLAN left the ATARI scene. He draws on PC world. I think he wants 
to make us pay for firing him... We hope you'll write in the next MAGGIE
ISSUE that  ADRENALINE  is alive and  that we have many projects. Do not
forget,the EVOLUTION from EXA is an ADRENALINE production. All the logos
were changed a few day before the  final version. Today EXA is not dead,
but as all EXA members are in ADRENALINE,the EXA team will not be active
in the future...




         Have a nice time and good luck for the future,

                     SEBASTIEN TRUTTET
