                  (Or why PC demos are utter pants!)


The 4KB intro category considered more closely..

1st Place: Power of 8Mhz by T.O.Y.S.                
ST/STe  (144 points)

Quite  a nice little entry that came in two parts,  the first bit was  a 
never  seen  before effect on STe,  a plasma fire effect,  a little  bit 
blockier  and  more chunky pixelled than some on other machines,  but  a 
real  fire  effect to be sure..  The second part was a fine-line  vector 
logo looking like it was made out of spiders webs, with a very short and 
to  the  point  scroller at the bottom..  One fact  discovered  by  this 
reviewer  was that this intro was not really 4KB at all,  as a fantastic 
feat  of  data  compression had got the file down  from  something  like 
131KB!!  Still,  it's  not  the  size  that  counts  (smug  grin!)  Most 
definitely STe only..

2nd Place: Life by Mace/Xtream                      
Falcon  (136 points)

A  single  screen intro,  but with plenty going on..  A vector-line  and 
multicoloured  vector  pyramid  spins in the  background,  as  a  'life' 
simulation  plays in the foreground splattering onto your screen..  This 
uses  a  chunky display,  and the 'life' game is quite  compelling  when 
viewed from, say fifteen feet away?? Try it!!

3rd Place: NoCrew                                   
Falcon  (131 points)

A  little  taster  of a 3-D world here,  as some simple objects  in  the 
foreground  move  around,  and  a graduated mountainous skyline  in  the 
background set the scene.. The screen moves backwards and forwards as if 
it  is being pulled and pushed away from the viewer in a continual  sea-
sickness motion..

4th Place: JimB                                     
ST/STe  (94 points)

A  traditional staple of the ST demo world makes a  reappearance  here.. 
Vector-bobs (ST demo scene c.1990) are back in town and on 4K!! Includes 
several  letters  forming  the  word 'F I N L A N  D'  in  shiny  purple 
marbles.. Ahhh lovely!            STe only again..

5th Place: Lehma by Skraappa!Skruuppi               
PC    (85 points)

I saw this one (and the other PC entrants) on my dear mother's 486  PC.. 
In  between sessions of drug crazed Windows cardgame abuse,  I spun this 
one up twice to overcome the initial disbelief..  A screenshot showing a 
rather well 'developed' bull scrolls on to the screen, the impression is 
of a grab from a lo-rez and lo-colour art package,  and that's it!! Must 
have got the Finnish obscure humour vote or something..

6th Place: Paska by Taxoblne                        
PC    (82 points)

Getting  better,  as  a  bit of 'real' coding here..  A sort of  texture 
mapped  landscape  scoots past,  at least I think it is something to  do 
with texture mapping,  equally,  it could be a system crash. A couple of 
very  indistinct 3-D objects lurk in the background,  never getting  any 
closer.. What's going on??

7th Place: Kudzun by VLP                            
PC    (68 points)

Here comes another one,  even more bollocks than the last one! Just some 
ANSI  text that comes on to the screen with the name of  the  individual 
who  composed  this epic..  Nothing more than a super-deluxe version  of 
that Saturday computer shop classic, back in the eighties:- 

10 Print "Wayne Roolz"
20 Goto 10

Need I say any more??

8th Place: IMP                                      
Falcon  (34 points)

Compared with some of the previous PC stuff,  a bit unfairly maligned to 
get eighth place..  This comes in two parts,  a spinning (on a 3-D axis) 
fractally  generated  lump of seaweed,  and then some colours  in  fancy 
blocks set in an unmoving fashion on screen..

                    _________________________________

But  we  still don't have an answer to the question of  PC  demos  being 
utter pants!!  Maybe they think 4K is a note to the milkman in computing 
terms,  where  your average ST coder can squeeze a novel from that  same 
paltry  space..  People used to write entire games within 3.5K,  if they 
owned a Commodore Vic 20, even less with a 'baseline' 1K Sinclair ZX81!! 
So I don't see what they're moaning about!!


 CiH for Skynet Times - Feb '96.. (Hastily blagged for Maggie as well as 
Skynet  Times is simply taking ages to show up,  and I don't want to let 
this go to waste..)

           The Aggression Party 128KB Intros for Falcon

One of those little articles due to go into Skynet Times issue  8, 
but John is way too slow.. I thought Maggie 20 was procrastinating 
magnificently  but *our* last issue was in February,  Skynet Times 
was last seen in erm,  September??? Sort of reminds you of the old 
Michael  Schussler joke about some articles reaching  their  first 
anniversary..

Anyway, without further ado etc..

Whirlpool 128KB Intro by Extream (Falcon)

The  9th place in its category at  the Aggressive Party  where  it 
was up against some pretty stiff PC competition.. This is a fairly 
simple  affair with a pretty flower at the start,  and a prolonged 
series of plasma kalidescope tunnels that hurtle ceaselessly  past 
your  Falcon..  You are reminded a lot of an early Chaos AD effect 
on  the  ST  called the 'Bedlam Demo'..  A modfile  plays  in  the 
background..

 64% - Nice but nothing stunning..
 
Aggression Super Wolfenstein 128KB intro (Falcon as well)

This  intro  managed  a respectable third place  against  this  PC 
dominated  section of the convention..  Another two-parter with  a 
wasp  logo  and 'Agression' script drawing in as if by  hand  (and 
using  truecolour  to  simulate  chalk/charcoal  textures..   This 
dissolves  to  reveal the second part growing  into  the  screen.. 
Another Wolfenstein dungeon to be sure, but a healthy outdoor one, 
with subtle and considered use of colour and shade,  a cloudy blue 
sky,  and  a  very  subtle  misting effect  which  builds  up  the 
atmosphere.. This tilts at an angle as if you were flying down the 
corridors.. Runs at quite a decent lick too.. 

A classy effect,  really well executed..  Their 'Motion Blur' demo 
for  the Falcon is sure to be really special when it finally  hits 
the streets!

 94% - More more MORE please!!
