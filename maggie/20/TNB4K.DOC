                              ---------

The naughty bytes'  entry  to  the  Symposium  '96  4K  competition is
actually quite a good one. At least it has a sense of humour, and also
nods its head to Jeff  "God"  Minter.  (Oops,  bit of blasphemy there,
I'll have those mad  German  blokes  from  Spirits  burning  me at the
stake.)

Some garishly coloured text  proclaiming  that  "WE  ARE BSE POSITIVE"
zooms in, the latter two words leaving  a nice trail. Being British at
the Symposium wasn't easy -  we  hed  to  fend  off  all sorts of Beef
related jibes. You begin to feel  some  sympathy for Douglas Hogg. But
not much.

After TNB have informed  us  of  their  current medical condition, the
demo begins  properly.  The  screen  is  put  into  double  line  mode
(Apparently Atari engineers specifically  designed this resolution for
German demo coders. Spooky.) and a  clock  appears in the bottom right
hand corner of the screen. As the demos were only supposed to be shown
for 2 minutes each, this  provides  a  countdown  until the end of the
demo. It has alternative uses - a  handy egg timer, or perhaps a clock
for people who live on fastly orbitting planets whose days last a mere
120 seconds.

The demo is based around the  classic Melt-O-Vision  [(C) Jeff Minter]
and caries it off with  some  aplomb. The advantage that Melt-O-Vision
has over most demo effects is that you can stick different graphics in
it and it will look different. You can generally mess about and create
some nice freaky colour effects. Which is what TNB do.

So we have a couple  of  interpolated  shaded boxes bouncing about the
screen leaving Melt-O-Vision trails, we  have effects that threaten to
turn into rotating zoomers, but then  just melt, and we generally have
lots of colour thrown around, rather like painting day in a playgroup.
Except without the milk and biscuits  at lunchtime. Or the sandpit for
that matter.

TNB try to take the effect a  stage  further by doing a RGB split, but
this gives such an  impediment  to  the  frame-rate  that whole effect
suffers. Still nice try.

Overall a highly entertaining little  demo  proving that throwing lots
of colours about and  hoping  for  the  best  is  always  a recipe for
success, and is a lot tastier than beef.
