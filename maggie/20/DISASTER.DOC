                  Various tales of decline and fall..

It  may  have come to a lot of peoples attention that ST News  is  very 
shortly  to produce its final issue..  Is this an honourable retirement 
for a very long lived diskmag with a distinguished career?  Well yes it 
is,  and  it does seem to be (almost) one of a kind,  that is a diskmag 
that has managed to live as long as it has, and more importantly, it is 
quitting whilst it is ahead..

These cautionary tales are not about ST-News though.. These are stories 
intended to serve as instruction and warning for other would-be diskmag 
editors,  which could potentially mean most people now reading, as just 
about  everyone seems to be attempting a diskmag in some form or  other 
during their time on the Atari..

Without further padding out, I bring you several sorry tales of Diskmag 
disaster,  or  the possible reasons why these publications shunned  the 
limelight to the extreme of going extinct..

Delta Force Maggie..
Hem  hem,  well  we have to take our place here in the line-up  of  the 
guilty, as Maggie in the Delta Force era (issues eight to ten) went off 
the boil a bit in various areas..

*Note Carefully!* We said Delta Force Maggie!
   
Delta  Force  Maggie was most memorable for the superbly  coded  custom 
menu shell/text displayer program that many of you are seeing now..  It 
was only slightly less memorable for some spectacularly dodgy articles, 
especially in issue ten..  Both of these traits reflected the fact that 
Maggie  was  not really a proper regular diskzine during  that  period, 
but rather, the plaything of a slightly bored demo crew..

Any idea of keeping Maggie current went right out of the square  glass-
filled  space  (the 'W' word is probably a trademark  of  Microsoft  by 
now!)  as issues were delayed a stupidly long time,  sometimes up to  a 
year  of  many  of the original articles being  written..  This  dismal 
performance  was  started by the laziest German in the  World,  Michael 
Schussler,  who seemed to stop doing anything much once he had returned 
to his native land.. Delta Force stepped in directly, even they had got 
fed up waiting,  but things did not get much better.. Eventually, after 
issue ten, it became slowly apparent that no more issues were to follow 
from  them..  It seemed that they had got bored with the whole project, 
with  the  scene itself,  and damned if they were going to do  anything 
about it..

So Maggie should have stopped there.. But it didn't.. The rest you know 
by now..

Still,  it comes in as the first of our diskmag disasters because Delta 
Force  chose  to leave with not much trace of a final issue,  (A  teeny 
tiny  hint they were thinking of quitting somewhere in issue  ten,  but 
you have to have your extra-sharp reading glasses on to find it!) 

Category of Demise:- 'We can't be bothered anymore.'

Proper ceremonial send-off issue:- No, not really..


STEN (ST Enthusiasts Newsletter)..
Now  this  one  came  as a complete surprise..  STEN,  under  the  twin 
editorship  of Dave Mooney and John Weller seemed to be thriving as  an 
alternative  'serious'  diskmag which set itself apart  from  the  demo 
subculture  background of most of its contemporaries..  STEN managed to 
get  a  seemingly satisfactory level of reader  interaction,  including 
some  people who went on to star in their own publications  later  on.. 
One such notable was Keefy of the Stosser/Warp series of diskmags.. 

They  had the approval of ST News and even the glossy ST  Format  style 
paper mags, and it was a great surprise that it was announced that STEN 
was qutting from issue fifteen.. Within issue fifteen, in fact!

The  editors cited the lack of reader contributions as the main  reason 
for  stopping  STEN..  Possibly time,  or the lack of it,  may well have 
been  a factor,  and Dave Mooney moved on to the PC shortly afterwards, 
seeing which way the wind was blowing decline-wise perhaps..

At  least STEN did have the decency to produce a proper farewell  issue 
as it went..

Category of demise:- 'That's it, we're finished, you ungrateful lot!'

Proper  Ceremonial  send-off issue:- Yes,  almost a Viking  funeral  of 
one..


ST Beermat..
This is a most difficult one to pin down,  as it managed to have both a 
first and last issue simultaneously..  I always got the impression that 
there  were  going to be more ST Beermats,  but again,  the editor  Kev 
Davies,  seemed  to lose interest and drift away without really letting 
us know why..

ST Beermat had the potential to be perhaps the very best diskmag on the 
ST  scene  ever..  The debut issue was almost as perfect as human  hand 
could make it, and we all waited for the second issue..

And waited (have you used this one before? - Ed) but no sign for a long 
time..  'Beermat  had  a  paradox  of  an  editor  who  wanted  outside 
contributions,  but  did not feel inclined to accept anything that  was 
less  than  his own high standards.  (There is at least one  documented 
case of someone who got turned away by Kev Davies.. Surely an important 
part  of  any  editors job is to coax a good  or  at  least  acceptable 
article  from a poor submission?) Anyway,  this elitist policy may have 
cost  him  a  second issue..  (And not a few potential friends  on  the 
Atari??)

The  other  thing  that was heavy bummer time as far  as  'Beermat  was 
concerned was that Kev decided in one of his less sensible moments that 
it should be shareware..  Now I've made it clear in a previous issue of 
Maggie  that diskmags should be free and shareware as a concept  should 
be reserved for programs that do something worthwhile..

Kev  thought  different..   Anyway,  I'd  put  money  on  the  lack  of 
contributions  in  this department having a very large bearing  on  the 
non-appearance of the Second issue of ST Beeermat..

Category of demise:- 'Refer to X-Files!'

Proper  ceremonial  send-off  issue:-  The  infants  swaddling  clothes 
happened also to be its funeral gown!!


Power Diskmag..
Another successful diskmag which fell apart rather rapidly at the end..

Power  was  almost  unique,  as it managed to cultivate and  develop  a 
healthy  reader  participation culture from a normally quiet  UK  Atari 
scene..  Something  that  STEN could have done with a couple  of  years 
earlier.. Power also managed to be monthly, and was remembered as being 
most  successful  when it was monthly..  The editor James Mathews  then 
decided  to expand his repertoire,  and that is when things started  to 
get tricky..

At  the  end,  James was running the diskmag as editor,  also a  public 
domain  library  Power PD,  also a commercial software  publisher,  Top 
Byte, ALSO having to find time to go to school for full time education, 
eat,  sleep,  go to the toilet etc..  Something had to give, and it was 
the  magazine that first slipped,  from monthly to bi-monthly,  then it 
got stuck somewhere around issue 28 in the Summer of '95..

James  has  had  to  shed other commitments as well,  and  at  time  of 
writing,  just Top Byte remains..  Of Power Diskmag,  another issue has 
been in the works for some time, but will it ever see release??

Category of demise:- 'Hang on, I'll get back to you just as soon as...'

Proper ceremonial send-off issue:- Stuck in James's disk box..


Bubbling under..
Quite apart from these four famous demises, several other diskmags have 
gone  quietly belly-up,  or made noises as if they were about to do so, 
here are some of these..

Stosser..
A  'Serial Quitter' with several editors,  who have each threatened  to 
stop producing a la STEN if they didn't hear more from their  readers.. 
This  magazine  may have finally,  finally finished production after  a 
very long run??

Warp..
The hand of Keefy heavily involved in here too,  as he could not resist 
the temptation to say in issue three "Look if you don't write in..." He 
subsequently realised that this was an extremely silly line to take for 
a casual fun-only 'For the hell of it as and when' type of publication.

DBA Mag..
Speaking  of  which,  we haven't had a "I'll stop the mag if you  don't 
write in immediately" editorial from Slimer for, oh, a couple of issues 
now!!

Falcon  Update,  Skynet  Times  and Pure Bollocks,  to name three,  are 
merely very very late..

Ermm, what did happen to the Ledgers Diskmag??
