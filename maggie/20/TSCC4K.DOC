                              TSCC 4KTRO
                              ----------

TSCC may be most famous  for  creating  the brilliant DynaBusters, but
they are also pretty good when  it  comes to programming demos as this
intro shows.

This 4Ktro is based around 3D  graphics,  something that can be stored
in quite a compact way unlike  bitmap  graphic.  The intro runs in 256
colour at a healthy 25 frames per second.

The intro consists of  objects  rotating  and  morphing  over a plasma
style background.  The  background  is  basically  some  circles being
variably zoomed in X and Y, but it does the job.

The objects themselves are  very  finely  detailed.  They are all line
vectors - not filled or shaded. They are made up of loads of point and
have a small bitplane trail, so they look quite smart.

It begins with a flat polygon mesh  which morphs into a cylinder. This
then transforms into a glass (fancy a brew, our kid?) then a sphere, a
torus and finally back into the  mesh. Whilst the objects are rotating
and morphing, the background zooms about a bit.

The demo is very nicely  put  together,  the objects are well designed
and everything moves  smoothly.  Its  definitely  one  of  the best 4K
intros I've seen. The Scy is the limit!
