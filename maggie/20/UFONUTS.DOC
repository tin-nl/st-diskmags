"I am keeping my name secret because the U.S.government are out to kill
me,  because of the truth that I know  about the  alien abductions that
have been going on,  I only hope  that by  distributing  this  document
across the internet I can get  lazy  disk  magazine  editors to include
it in their disk magazines when they've run out of ideas for articles."

I  suppose  it's fair  to say  that apart from all the nice people that
live there, America is a  haven for  total  nutters.  Apart from  their
insane gun laws,  nothing proves this  view so much as the existence of
the  UFO NUTTERS. You know the types, "I was abducted by a UFO and made
to have sex  with  a mutilated  cow  while  some  aliens watched with a
camcorder and gave me a blood transfusion from a chicken".

There  are millions  of these saddos throughout  the States  and what's
worse,  when  they're not  watching  their  favourite  programme,  "The
X-Files",  they're  all  spreading their  deluded  ramblings across the
internet.

UFO  NUTTERS come in  two types,  the first  are  the  ones  who either 
claim to have been abducted by aliens or worked  at  a top-secret U.S.
military base  that is  heaped full  of crashed flying saucers and dead
aliens,  and the second are the gullible idiots who believe their every
word. Just look at that documentary that was shown on Channel 4 a while
back  featuring  the "authentic"  alien autopsy  footage of  two blokes
prodding a rubber dummy with scalpels in  a rather  cheap-looking  set.
The UFO NUTTERS think this is real!   

But who  are  these idiots? Obviously they are close relatives of that
other branch  of  American headcases, the "Star Trek Is Real" brigade,
who  spend  all  their  free  time  learning to  recite Shakespeare in
Klingon and  shooting  the next door neighbours' cat with a toy phaser
they  bought off the Home Shopping Network. These fools have permeated
American society so  much,that you can now study for a degree in "Star
Trek" at college in America, can you believe it?

And what's  worse,  there  are  now  British  UFO  NUTTERS  too! These
peoples' interests tend to  revolve  around  clumsily  faked UFO alien
photos rather than the  "being  abducted  by  aliens" experences their
American relatives thrive on.  This  is  presumably  because the right
type of hypnotists can't be found in Britain. As we all know, everyone
who claims to have been abducted does so under hypnosis. If you go and
see any hypnotist in Britain however, you  are more likely to come out
shouting "I want to go the  toilet" whenever someone says "ostrich" or
thinking that your  glasses  are  actually  X-ray  spectacles and then
start taking down  your  trousers,  rather  than  going  on  about UFO
abductions. 

I like science-fiction myself,  but unlike these people I can make the
crucial distincion between  fact  and fantasy. Given the sheer size of
the universe, it  is  probable that there is intelligent life on other
planets, but due  to  two  rather important  facts, namely the average
distance between  stars,  and  the  speed  of light, it is going to be
rather  hard  and  pointless in  them  coming over here, especially if
it's just to stick  tubes up Christopher Walkens' bottom like they did
in that  film  "Communion". 

What are these  aliens doing anyway?  Are they collecting material for
some intergalactic version of "You've Been Framed" or  something? Just
imagine, on another planet 200 million light years away,  some  aliens
are  watching "hilarious" videos of humans running around woods   with
bright lights  being  shined on them.  Some  hideous-looking  creature  
(i.e. an  alien with a Jeremy Beadle mask on) then comes on the screen
and says that "If you send in your funny home videos of you  abducting
humans and winding back their  watches to confuse them,  send them  in
and you could win 250 Galactic Credits! See you next  week!".

The  truth  could  be closer than you think....
