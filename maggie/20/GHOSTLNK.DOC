To say that ghostlink is a  unique  program would be just as good
assaying ghostlink is a PC - Atari networking system. This little
pair of programs allows your ST  (or  TT, or Falcon) to drive the
PC as a slave thus  allowing  you  to  effectively access all the
PC's mediums of storage. The upshot  of which is simply that with
the use of a plain old every  day  null modem cable you can use a
PC as a large (if somewhat cumbersome) disk drive.
 Okay, so you know what  it  does.  By  now you are thinking this
program is going to be a bugger to  set up envolving all sorts of
dodgey and obscure options. How  wrong  you  are.  The  PC end of
things is just a  little  DOS  based  file  which requires you to
select the COM  port  you  are  interested  in  and  the speed of
transfer.
 The Atari end is  a  little  bit  more  interesting  with a well
constructed GEM interface, although  Falcon  owners  do not get a
special sculpted one :-( Shame. On this screen you can select the
port you are reading from  (owners  of  MEGAs  and TTs can access
more than one PC). You can also define the name of the device you
wish to use as the link, A-Z. Once all of this is done it is just
a matter of clicking install and away you go.

The TEST.
I tested it  using  my  younger  PC  owning  brothers machine and
accessed his CD ROM drive to  play a little tracker music. Urika!
It works. The world  of  CD  ROMs  here  I  come.....No, wait the
documentation states that there a few bugs and you cannot run PRG
files directly from CD :-( . However I suppose  I could  download
from Atari CDs to Hard drive. Sigh!
 Speed wise it isn't that bad,  its  no Linford Christie, but its
no arthritic snail either. Even with a three meter cable the wait
was negligible.
 In conclusion certainly it is a  great little program to have if
you have access to a Multi Media  PC  and don't fancy forking out
dosh on a CD ROM for your Atari. Anyway Ataris are more versitile
than PCs arn't they.

Additional
 If you are thinking about giving this program a  bash, but don't
have a null modem cable here is how  to make one (each contains a
9pin connector as most PCs have them.
