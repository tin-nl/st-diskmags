
Hi Chris,

A bundle of Gembench reports for Afterburner and Nemesis, plus the last Press
Release.

Happy reading!

Cheers,    Dave.

NEMESIS - PRESS RELEASE
from Black Scorpion Software Ltd

Black Scorpion's new hardware accelerator, Nemesis, is making great progress and
should be ready to ship towards the end of May/early June. Nemesis has been
designed specifically to support the entire APEX range of software programs,
i.e. Media, Intro, and the forthcoming APEX 3 and APEX Audio.

Although price has not been finalised, we expect it to be no more than #39.95
(incl. VAT & carriage) to existing APEX Media/Intro users. Non-APEX users can
expect to pay a further #10.00. The price has risen by #10.00 due to an extra
Clock Oscillator being included into the design (now switchable up to 48MHz) to
ensure total compatibility with all properly written Atari software.

Provisional Specification
Bus - 24MHz - faster than most other accelerators and enables APEX 3 to achieve
640x480 (or higher), true-colour, non-interlaced on a VGA monitor. The higher
Bus speed should also allow Expose' frame rates of 25fps at 256x160!
CPU - 24MHz - a lower CPU speed ensures total reliability. Exceeding 32MHz can
prove unreliable in any case.
FPU - switchable between 24MHz and 48MHz - to ensure compatibility with
different processors, i.e. FPUs rated at 16MHz may not 'take the strain'.
DSP - 48MHz - much more important to APEX than CPU speed, as all versions of
APEX are mainly machine-coded for the DSP.

As you can see we have concentrated on reliability and have still managed to
produce an accelerator which exceeds the specification of many of its
competitors and, in addition, achieves a price which makes it totally affordable
to anyone!

AFTERBURNER
from Titan Designs Ltd

TITAN DESIGNS have recently been appointed as the official UK distributor for
the Afterburner040 Falcon accelerator.

The Afterburner040 can be supplied with either a 68LC040 or full 68RC040
processor. The main difference between the 'LC' and 'RC' versions is that the
higher spec processor comes with an internal 68882 maths co-processor.

PRICES (for the UK, incl. VAT & carriage)

68LC040    - #449.00
68RC040   - #539.00

Afterburner040 gives an enormous increase in sheer processing power and is very
compatible with a wide range of software - existing APEX Media/Intro users can
also upgrade free of charge to v2.2 for an amended version of the when they
purchase an Afterburner040.

Black Scorpion Software, in conjunction with Titan Designs, will also be
evaluating the possibility of running both the NEMESIS accelerator *WITH* the
AFTERBURNER to increase the CPU, Bus and DSP speeds even further!

AFTERBURNER TECH SPEC
- Motorola 68040 or 68LC040 CPU producing 32/64MHz
- Two 72-pin SIMM sockets for optional memory expansion up to 128MB Fast-RAM
- Falcon Bus throughport for Expose, Screeneye, FalconSpeed, etc.

Although a larger case will be required, Titan Designs will also be handling the
new C-Lab Falcon Mk.X case upgrades which are ideal for use with the
Afterburner040. More details on the Mk.X case upgrades when available.

MEMORY PRICES
New lower prices on memory is making that Falcon upgrade an even more realistic
proposition. All prices quoted are for 72-pin, 70ns (or faster) devices, which
are fully compatible with Afterburner, and incl. VAT & carriage.

4MB - #37.00
8MB - #75.00
16MB - #149.00

Falcon 14MB upgrade board - #39.95

This means, of course, that a 16MB upgrade for the Falcon is now well below
#300! But, as an added incentive, we will supply both 16MB SIMM and the Falcon
upgrade board for only #279.00.

NEW - 28.8K MODEMS!
Titan Designs are spreading the Web! We can now supply 28.8Kbps modems with full
BABT and CE approval, and compatible with the Atari, for only #169.00.

If your pocket doesn't stretch this far, then we can supply a 14.4Kbps modem
(again with BABT & CE approval) for a mere #109.00.

respond very quickly!

NEMESIS BENCHMARKS

The first is 32MHz operation (standard), followed by 40MHz and 48MHz. You will
notice a few things;

1. No FPU is present - This is because an FPU wasn't present :-)
2. Blitter not present - Disabling the Blitter is necessary to make Nemesis
work.
3. NVDI is present - Most people will probably have this anyway, but some of the
utilities for Nemesis need it installed, at present, for safety. This will
probably change for the full production version.
