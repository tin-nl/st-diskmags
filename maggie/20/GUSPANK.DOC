
                         Gus Spank Presents:-

Yehh,  he's  back!  The  one,  the  only,  most miserable git in all of 
Maggiedom.. Gus Spank!!
 
This  time,  we  all  go  musical with the most  irritating  and  trite 
offerings that the world of song has for us..

Songs I really hate:- The first one is an easy one.. Just mention Bryan 
Adams'  'Summer  of  '69.. Easy to dislike eh!!

What is wrong you ask,  well quite a lot in fact.. Bryan Adams typifies 
the  safe  bland 'mainstream' approach to music..  He writes the  songs 
that make the whole world go 'Eckhh!' but at least Barry Manilow and co 
don't  try  to tart up their terminal naffness with  the  fake  plastic 
pretend  rebel rocker outfit that Adams swathes himself in..  It  fools 
nobody except the very easily pleased corporate sponsers of such pap..

The  man just screams a nasty sort of cosiness..  He might as well have 
written 'Summer of MFI' instead, the song is so utterly commercial, and 
peculiarly  suited to a lifestyle revolving around informal  barbeques, 
pick  up trucks for urban dwellers seeking that  'country'  experience,  
blue jeans and southern-style chicken nuggets commercials,  utter utter 
cliche  American  style "Soft-rock" mainstream crap,  I don't like  the 
song much either.. 

And  another thing..  Where was he when the ACTUAL REAL 'summer of '69' 
came  about..  To  think  of the way that he pumps nostalgia  into  the 
airwaves,  faster  than a riot policman fires CS Gas into a troublesome 
neighbourhood,  you  might be forgiven for thinking that Bryan Adams is 
(A)  Quite  old,  and  (B)  basing this song  on  real  and  meaningful 
experiences..  However,  I  understand that Bryan Adams was only twelve 
when  the 'Summer of '69' took place??  If this is the case,  that puts 
him  beyond any sort of help,  that special sad category of the wannabe 
figure.. A person who cannot relate to their life here and now, and has 
to hark back to a fictional nostalgic past to get their kicks..

People who think like this should:-

FUCK  OFF!!  and leave the nineteen-sixties to the old farts who  lived 
through  it,  and  who constantly remind us of the fact that they  went 
through  it because they own all the TV stations and film studios..  It 
is  bad  enough  having  REAL 'sixties  survivors'  like  Oliver  Stone 
constantly plague us, but PRETEND ones like Bryan Adams as well!>!>!>!

Such people should be wiped from the face of the planet!

On  a  personal  note,  when  I experienced the summer of  '69,  I  was 
deciding  whether to play with the push-along horsie,  or the cardboard 
box.. Really ground breaking song material stuff eh! 

PUT  HIM  IN THE BIN WITH ALL THE OTHER FAKE ROCK COUNTRY  AND  WESTERN 
SINGERS! (Sorry, wrong article!)

Another  tuneless  tune that has got my irritation  glands  going  most 
recently  is  that  easy  listenin' pile  of  shite  'Lifting'  by  the 
Lighthouse family.. 

This is an unassuming lttle tune that has been 'lifted' to the  heights 
of  dry finger scraping the inside of the mouth irritation  by  getting 
way  too  much  airplay from unthinking daytime  disk  jocks..  Another 
classic   in  this  played  to  death  mould  was  that  really   early 
demonstration  of  how badly sample sequencers could be  programmed  by 
talentless  people 'Ride on Time' by Black Box,  or 'R-r-r-r-riiiide on 
Tiiime,  Ru-ru-riide  on  Tiime' as it soon became known..  Sorry was I 
ranting on a bit there..

Anyway  'Lifted' has those castratii from the Devils own  sulphur  pit, 
the  Lighthouse  family,  surely  a nineties repackaging  of  the  crap 
Osmonds burbling away to a slightly surprised spanish guitar lick  that 
normally  appears  at the beginning of just about all  holiday  related 
travel television,  but which was coshed over the head and bundled into 
the back of a van by those evil Lighthouses and made to appear here, so 
the  tune is twee and irritating to start with,  but made unbearable by 
being  played  three  times every hour on whatever  radio  station  you 
happen to pick up..  Yes, even the bloody current affairs spot on Radio 
Belgrade has its compulsory hourly 'Lighthouse quota!!'

This one has now burned itself out, but they're set to repeat the whole 
process  with another single which those shag-pile carpet brained  DJ's 
will love and play to death.. Aaaagh!!
 
GUS SPANK SAYS STOP LIGHTHOUSE FAMILY BID FOR WORLD DOMINATION NOW!!

Morrisey/The Smiths..

I  belong  to the age group that is supposed to go  slack  chinned  and 
drooly  jawed  at  the  mere mention of his name..  I  say  instead  OI 
MORRISEY,  TAKE THOSE DAFFODILS OUT OF YOUR ARSE,  STOP PRANCING AROUND 
AND ACT LIKE A MAN INSTEAD!! Never liked him, never never..

The Cranberries..

Ohhh Goddd!! Delores O'Riordan, what are we to do with her??

Delores  has  a  very distinctive voice..  Sort of  harsh  and  grating 
really..  Sort of like a cross between a wounded seagull unable to move 
being  slowly smothered by the cruel uncaring sand dunes,  and a set of 
badly  adjusted and worn brakepads on a 1956 Ford Anglia..  I think she 
is overdosing on a vocal style known as 'Keening' if you are into  this 
Celtic   culture  Hampstead  coffee  morning  appreciation  thing,   or 
'pretentious wailing', as it is known to the rest of us..

The  Cranberries most recent work has been rightly castigated  for  its 
extreme  portentiousness  and 'MEGO' (My Eyes Glaze Over)  syndrome  by 
stating  the  obvious and overstating their uncanny  grasp  of  current 
affairs  in  their  lyrics..  If  I  want to  jack  up  on  misery  and 
hopelessness,  I'd  rather  watch  Jeremy Paxman and the  rest  of  the 
Newsnight crew instead..

Lighten  up and get a life eh,  you're way too old to think like Social 
Studies Students anymore!

In  the head/In their head/They are fightinggggg/With their  tanks  and 
their bombs, and their guns, and erm, more guns, etc..

Anyway, it is old ground that U2 travelled over much better a decade or 
so ago with their excellent song 'Sunday Bloody Sunday!'

(Sheesh!!)

(Goddamned  hard  typing in the DARK folks BTW!!  Now 1.44am on  Sunday 
Morning!   Aaagh!!  -  There's  something  particularly  painful  about 
adjusting  from an insanely bright screen,  to the darkened keyboard in 
these low light condictions, the afterglare from the monitor just after 
you look down just stops you seeing ANYTHING of the keyboard for  about 
five  seconds or so,  but you start typing anyway and that is when  the 
worst  typos  creep into the text..  You look up to see what  has  gone 
wrong,  and you are dazzled again, and the whole sad process turns full 
circle  and  starts  again..  This means that the word count  for  this 
article  is  dismally  low right now for the time put  in..  I'm  outta 
here!!)

 GS.
