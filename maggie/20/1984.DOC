The second and concluding part of our mini-epic,  great,  he managed to 
keep it down to a reasonable length and number of episodes this  time.. 
Look out for the surprise happy ending!! Now read on!! - CiH..

Part II..

For  quite a while afterwards Winston brooded over the content  of  the 
message that Julia had slipped to him..  She was interested in him, but 
why?  She  was  a  bright  and attractive girl,  a bit too  much  of  a 
caricature  Anti  Hacking League activist for his liking,  but she  did 
fill  out her otherwise plain overalls in some quite attractive  ways.. 
Winton blushed to himself,  and firmly put such thoughts aside..  There 
had to be something else going on. Something with an hidden agenda that 
Winston  would probably not enjoy,  but he was going to have to explore 
this pathway of possibilities further..

                             ------V------

19.00h  Microsoft standard time,  the Rolf Harris Revolutionary Martyrs 
Memorial  Square,   London,  and  Winston  watched  the  first  of  the 
many  Infotainment Week parades lurch by..  This was a public execution 
of several hundred captured Apple Corp employees,  who watched sullenly 
from  their cages,  dressed only in the rags of the business suits they 
were captured in..   

Winston  briefly  remembered the cryptic short message on  the  bit  of 
paper that Julia had given him the previous day...  "Rolf Harris is 19H 
tomorrow in the corner of Avena Prospect.." it said..  Winston supposed 
she had asked for a meeting with him,  possibly a sneakily devious trap 
set  by the Anti-Hacking League trying to meet their arrest quota in  a 
slow week.. He sensed proximity of someone trying to get his attention, 
and  turned,  steadfastly ignoring the last abbreviated gurgles of  the 
Apple Corp employees dangling on the end of a data back-up tape noose..

It was indeed Julia, with that most unauthorised of facial expressions, 
a slow and slightly mysterious smile..  

"Hello  Winston,  I  thought  you  would make it.." She  said  "A  fine 
evening.."  Conversation was not a priority skill in the  Anti  hacking 
League.. She turned to him and whispered "I'm not what I seem, I really 
fight against Big Bill..  There are others like me..  Even Inner Circle 
people like Griff.."

She  handed  him another piece of paper and walked away..  Winston  had 
only a moment to register surprise,  and she was gone..  Another moment 
to  stifle  the  expression of surprise in case he was  noticed  in  an 
attitude consistent with an act of 'Usercrime'..

"WHERE  SHALL  YOU GO TODAY!!" The loudspeakers in  the  square  boomed 
out..

"WHEREVER  YOU  TELL  US  TO!!"  Screamed  back  the  equally   fervent 
audience..

                             ------V------

Winston hurried to the station,  an excited fumbling step taking him to 
a covert and unapproved meeting with the bearer of this latest piece of 
paper..  It  seemed  that she merely wanted the pleasure  of  Winston's 
company,  and that exciting possibilities were a likely outcome,  since 
she  had openly revealed her true interests and allegiences..  If  this 
was  still not a trap,  and she was genuine,  then it looked like Julia 
and himself could make a truly worthwhile partnership that could  stand 
even against the worst of Big Bill..

It  was  a  warm day and Winston waited for a couple of  hours  at  the 
station.. The coaches were infrequent and erratic, and it semed to take 
more  tedious hours for the journey to the coast..  Winston was perched 
uncomfortably  on  a battered and comfortless seat sitting  opposite  a 
raucous  group of Nintendo Yoof League members singing a whole  ghastly 
array of rousing Mario songs, 'to raise spirits'.. 

It depressed Winston further..

However,  even the most hellish journey comes to an end (unless you are 
travelling to Hamburg!)  Winston walked and walked the dusty trail into 
the early afternoon, until he arrived at the isolated lonely woods that 
Julia had described in the letter.. The overgrowth shaded the path, and 
Winston walked on.. He stopped momentarily at a likely rendevous spot..

Julia was waiting nearby..

"Hello Winston, I bet you haven't seen a *real* one of these before!"

And she was wearing nothing more than a deliciously wicked grin..

All  of  Winston's previous fumbling onscreen  InfoNet  experiences  of 
'Virtual  Valerie' and 'Plastic Pam' jumped out of his  mind  screaming 
for  mummy as the real thing strode purposefully towards him  with  her 
arms open..

A while later..

Winston  and Julia gazed curiously and absently at each other,  sharing 
the softness of the past hour with each other..

"I've got something else for you darling." She murmured..

"I've not recovered yet.."

"That is just a silly old state of mind.." She giggled..

And so it went on some more with neither of them wanting to stop..

                             ------V------

It was the latter stages of mid morning at work, that sort of time that 
vague rebellious thoughts of lunch first start to insinuate themselves, 
when  the  priority  message came thudding  through  the  infotube..  A 
communique  from  Inner Circle headquarters no less,  and  encoded  for 
private message delivery for Winston Smiths eyes only..

Winston  read  it,  careful  not to let himself be overlooked,  or  his 
expression give away the fact that something was going on..

The  message  was  a summons to the private apartments  of  Griff,  the 
leader  of the Inner Circle,  a glamourous figure,  a former hacker and 
coder  who had been personally converted to the rightness of PC by  Big 
Bill  himself,  and  was  now one of the most trusted  figures  of  the 
leadership..  Winston  blushed briefly at the sudden onset of memory of 
his illegal liason with Julia..  What if he knew of this? But Julia had 
said  that Griff was not all he seemed,  and was a secret supporter  of 
the  hackers and coders still working despite the restrictions  of  Big 
Bill and the oppressive 'Operating System Legal' culture that  pervaded 
Captive market No. 1..

It  was  therefore with a certain tummy  fluttering  anticipation  that 
Winston  presented  himself at the Front entrance of the  luxury  Inner 
Circle apartment block, and pressed the bell.. It was Griff who let him 
in,  and  bade Winston to sit down on one of the bulky and  overstuffed 
chairs in the lounge.. 

"Good to meet you at last, I've heard a lot about you from Julia, she's 
a clever girl, finding you for our little gathering.."

"Now don't be alarmed Winston,  we've known about your other activities 
for  a while now,.." As he said this,  he stabbed a couple of keys on a 
big  black  InfoNet terminal to bring up a couple  of  Winston's  early 
attempts at 3-D vector routines..

"Now most people try coding at an early age,  get caught, and have this 
tendency  beaten or conditioned out of them..  The majority don't  take 
this  any  further,  the  few  that try later,  are also  detected  and 
punished.."

"A clever few will keep quiet about their weakness, or what we consider 
to  be  strengths..  They will find out about our secret programs  that 
work  outside the operating system,  that really shake rattle and  roll 
the hardware.. Push the pedal to the metal so to speak.."

Griff was nearly perspiring with the passions kicked up by his speech..

"In short, they need friends in high places, and so do you.."

"Why me?" Was all Winston could manage at that moment..

"You've got a certain talent that needs nurture.. A little bit of help, 
technical documentation,  some illegal and interesting system calls,  a 
bit of source code, it all goes a long way.."

The doorbell rang again..

"Ah, here's Julia now.."

Julia  shimmered into the room..  "I've got the graphics you  wanted.." 
She said..

"Good,  here's Winston again,  you may like to know now that he will be 
your coder, and will be working closely with you on the demo.. You will 
both dedicate yourself to the overthrow of Big Bill and all his works.. 
Just to show that I am sincere,  I have a copy of this very interesting 
banned book.."

Griff turned to a desk drawer and fished out a softback volume in black 
and white.. Winston recognised it immediately from its starring role in 
a  thousand  police infotainment bulletins..  It was no less  than  the 
infamous 'Atari Falcon 030 Owners manual!' He handed it to Winston..

"Keep this book well hidden, do not be seen with it in public, and read 
it carefully when you can.."

A thousand thoughts bounced into Winstons head as soon as he was handed 
the volume.. 'Well...' What would they say at work if they knew now..

                             ------V------

Over  the  next few weeks,  Winston and Julia searched out  a  discreet 
hiding  place  to  meet  up and work in  the  Prole  Quarters.  Another 
beneficial side effect was that they got to explore and know more about 
each other as well.. 

Mr  Davey,  the  shop owner of the broken down old antique shop in  the 
prole quarters took both of them into his confidence,let them have  the 
use of some disused upstairs rooms,  and otherwise left them to it.. As 
Griff  had  indicated,  he had access to sources that even  provided  a 
dusty,  but  still  useable Falcon 030 with a hard disk full of  useful 
utilities  and  other long forgotten masterpieces of  the  demo  coders 
art..  The  originators  of these works and the previous owner  of  the 
machine long wiped out of existence..  

The  demo  made good progress,  as Winston thumbed through  the  system 
calls  manual once more,  the well-used pages bearing the traces of yet 
more thumbprints.  Now  if he could catch the error...  There!!  as the 
offending  line of code submitted itself for his critical  gaze..  Next 
time he tried it, the routine ran and exited without crashing.. Winston 
felt  a  quiet elation slowly rise,  as he saved out the newly  created 
sourcefile..

As  the  drivelight  flickered out,  a familiar voice called  from  the 
adjacent room..  "Winston,  you can't ignore me forever,  why don't you 
leave  that  alone and come to me?" Julia was in the  bed,  the  covers 
pulled up,  leaving only her shoulders exposed..  Winston got in beside 
her and felt her move closer to him.. 

A little later,  the slightly open window filtered in the street sounds 
from outside the shop,  the cheerfully inane shouts of the proles going 
about their daily business..

"It's all down to the proles to save us.." Said Winston..

"What can the proles do for us?" Queried Julia..

"It's  all about the proles you see..  They get on with their lives and 
don't  give a stuff about Big Bill and all his works..  Sure,  they use 
his systems and nothing else as they were never shown an  alternative.. 
They were not conditioned to expect any better.."

Winston gulped briefly and carried on..

"But  the thing about the proles is,  that they are unreachable..  They 
just use the stuff,  they do not absorb the message that goes with it.. 
Proles  always use pirate versions of Big Bill releases,  and are proud 
to  be  seen  to do this..  Proles treat the InfoNet as a means  to  an 
undoubtedly   trivial  end,   without  agonising  for  hours  over  the 
implications..  Big  Bill  has as much use and meaning as a doormat  to 
them!  "Keep  it  simple,  stupid" works up to a point, but if you keep 
people  too stupid,  then they'll never learn to become 'model'  users, 
for Big Bill."
 
"And he doesn't realise this?" Julia added..

"No,  the  dream  of  this sad broken down society of Big Bill  and  an 
InfoNet terminal in everybody's head just can't happen. The proles will 
be our saviours." 

Winston rested, having made his point..

                             ------V------

Summer matured slowly, the early promise of Spring gave way to long hot 
lazy  days and the little world of Winston and Julia  plodded  absently 
on..  Coding  on the demo continued an an easy good natured way,  until 
one late August day, it was all but finished.. 

Strangely,  as their work neared completion,  Winston felt a deep sense 
of purposelessness and emptiness.. What was to happen now to them? What 
was left to do.  Who would even know about what they were doing..  This 
kind of work craved an appreciative audience,  not one which would beat 
them until they were bleeding and unconscious..

"Are you thinking again Winston?"

"Yes Julia,  what are we trying to prove here?  It's not as though that 
we're  really going to change anything with what we're doing..  I think 
we've only got a little time left, as I'm sure if Griff knows about us, 
others in the Inner Circle will too.."

"We are dead." spoke Julia..

"You are dead." a tinny voice repeated..

Winston and Julia started and looked around shocked..

"This  has gone on long enough..  You are dead,  stand up and away from 
the wall,  hands over your heads..  Do not try to escape, this house is 
surrounded.." A picture fell away from the near wall to reveal a softly 
glowing  InfoNet  screen from which the voice  issued  through  tinnily 
nasty speakers..

Outside,  the sound of several pairs of running boots echoed around the 
street,  mixed  with  some  breaking  glass,  and then thudded  up  the 
stairs..

It  was  only  a  matter  of  seconds  before  the  heavily  armed  and 
flakjacketed troopers burst into the room. Winston was not surprised to 
see the crossed rolled up newspapers insignia of the Ministry of (Self) 
Love  stencilled  on their black and highly polished  helmets  as  they 
pushed him and Julia to the floor..

Winston was however,  surprised to see Griff, their supposed friend and 
confidante  in  the  uniform of a senior official of  the  Ministry  of 
(Self) Love, for he was in the room as well..

"Here comes a chopper to chop off your head.." The Infonet burbled on..

"Somebody  force  a  reboot  of that  terminal,  it's  patched  into  a 
children's edutainment program." Griff shouted..

An NCO yelled, "Move it! No-one ever got promotion by not responding to 
an order given by the Edge!"

"You  are  the  Edge!?"  Winston asked  with  a  expression  of  pained 
surprise..

"Yes, I am the Edge, I always was that personage, and you two have been 
caught  in  the act of committing Usercrimes against Big Bill  and  the 
Net..  And before you ask,  no I am not implicated in your misdeeds.. I 
made  the proposal,  you accepted when you should have declined..  Your 
guilt  was implicit from day one,  and we were just biding our time  to 
build an impressive case against you.." 

"No opposition to Big Bill can be tolerated,  there are threats all the 
time  surfacing against them,  and it is my mission to protect the  net 
against subversives like you..  We will build the Brave New World,  and 
we will build it on the backs of the uncomprehending sheeplike  masses, 
and  against the wishes of doubters and complainers like yourself..  By 
the  time we have finished,  not a single thought will turn against Big 
Bill,  all  will love him..  You will love him with every shred of your 
being  by  the  time we have finished with you too,  and  no,  I'm  not 
interested in your insincere regrets for your past errors.."

Griff paused momentarily then resumed..

"Picture this Winston..  Picture a training shoe, STAMPING INTO A HUMAN 
FACE.. FOREVER!!" 

With Griff's/The Edge's triumphant shout ringing in their ears, Winston 
and Julia were unceremoniously dragged away to their fate..

                             ------V------

Winston  slowly  regained  consciousness,  only slowly making  out  the 
confines  of the semi darkened room..  He realised that he was strapped 
securely  upright to a very firmly padded chair..  Then he realised his 
head  was  enclosed  in a cage..  In front of him,  a  trapdoor  stayed 
blankly  shut,  the  unknown walls of a small walkway  extended  beyond 
that, to whatever lay beyond.. 

This did not look good at all..

Griff  leered  through the metal mesh of the cage..  "This is Room  101 
Winston,  the  repository of your very worst fear,  your deepest horror 
given flesh, and claws, and teeth, oh yes!"

A shuffling and scrabbling noise started up near the trapdoor.. Winston 
felt his bowels turn to ice..

"Helloooo Everyone! It's Roland Rat!"

A  noisy  gurgle announced that the contents of  Winston's  bowels  had 
decided that they did not wish to be an intimate witness to the horrors 
to follow, and were bidding their leave..

Winston mercifully blacked out..

Griff  knuckled his forehead in frustration..  "But he was supposed  to 
start screaming he loved Big Bill.. Why not, why not?!"

"It's not just going to work.."

Somewhere in the room, a PC slowly bombed out..

                             ------V------

A  couple  of days later,  16.00h Microsoft Standard time,  in the late 
afternoon  light  of  Encarta  Broadway,  London..  Two  people  looked 
cautiously at each other..

"And they let you go too Winston?" Julia smiled..

"Yes,  it  seems  there was a floating point error which got  into  the 
records..  According  to  the  Edge  they simply had  to  release  me.. 
Something to do with the 'Implacable Will' of Big Bill..  Even if their 
systems  make a mistake,  they are bound by the error and had to let us 
go.."

"Ah,  the  Power of Pentium!!" Julia laughed..  They went on their way, 
untroubled by Big Bill for ever after..

                                The End
