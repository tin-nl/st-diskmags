                              ---------

I assume this 4K intro is by  DBA,  or someone affiliated to them as I
seem to remember they entered the  competition.  As there is no readme
file with it, and the file name is enigmatically titled "TEST_ASM.PRG"
I have no evidence anyone else wrote it.

OK, on with the review.

The file itself is tiny (as you expect from a 4K intro). The version I
have is unpacked AND still has the symbol table in it, and yet is only
4275 bytes. This is either the  most  awesome feat of coding, or there
isn't much in the demo.

Running the demo you find the latter to be the case.

Some text ("4KTRO") is printed all over  the screen. This is to become
the background for the effect. I  think  this is displayed in case you
were under the misconception that this is actually a 4meg demo.

The screen is filled with  a  4KTRO  logo  which  is mirrored in the x
axis. This  has  a  sinewave  distorter  running  through  it.  In the
background of the logo the "4KTRO" text scrolls.

On the top of the screen there is  also a spline type effect with lots
of dots rotating about.

Its a great effort for 4K, but  it  does look very ST. The effects are
very dated, and it doesn't compare very well with the other 4K intros.
The colours chosen and design aren't  the best. Even though the screen
is 768*240 in 16 colours,  it  looks  like  ST  Medium as only about 4
colours have been used.

Next time perhaps they will realise that they have a bit more space to
play around with and  that  they  can  have  more  than  one screen of
effects - this seemed to be a  bone of contention. For the time being,
the only phrase that springs  to  mind  is 4k off! (Appalling! Your're
hired! -Ed).


Owing to severe pressure on menu space. these two reviews have been
merged - CiH..

                              DBA 96KTRO
                              ==========

It is always worrying when you look  at  the file size of a 96ktro and
see that it doesn't come near  the  limit.  This intro clocks in at an
underwhelming 46k, so expectations were low.

The logo begins with a hastily  drawn  DBA logo being displayed at the
top of the screen. Underneath some  text  informs  us that this is, in
fact a 96Ktro (not a 46ktro)  and  was  coded in 45 minutes. This then
wipes off.

The effect then appears in the lower  portion of the screen. It is two
shaded rasters with a  sinewave  distortion  running  through them. As
this is 256 colour  mode,  a  bit  based  distortion would have looked
nice, but DBA opted to  move  things  in  16 pixel blocks, which makes
things a lot easier but a lot less visually impressive.

There are two rasters. The one  in  the  foreground is red. The one in
the background is green. There  is  really  not  much else to say. The
green one fades out giving red  the  chance  to  strut his stuff for a
bit, before retiring and offering  the  screen  back to green for some
more distortion based antics.

This demo was knocked up very quickly  and was probably a lot more fun
to code than it  is  to  watch.  Not  quite  "Master of Puppets", more
raster by muppets.
