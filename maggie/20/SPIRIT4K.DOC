                            SPIRITS 4KTRO
                            -------------

Most people haven't heard  of  "Spirits",  and  most people will never
hear of Spirits again as this  appears  to  be  their last demo, and a
pretty controversial one at that.

The demo begins  by  switching  into  double  line  mode  (yes,  it is
German). The screen  is  split  into  two  for  the  demo with effects
appearing  on  the  left  and  text   appearing  on  the  right.  This
effectively gives a 192x100 area for effects.

The first effect is a spinning  globe.  The definition is quite rough,
as you would expect from a 4K  intro,  but it still a good effect. The
countries then explode into fire and the earth spins around burning in
an Armageddon-stylee.

Another spherical object appears, this  looks  like an oversized beach
ball and it  spins  about  pleasantly.  I'm  sure  there  is some deep
theological meaning to this object's  structure and angle of rotation,
but I couldn't find it.

Next up there is the lake of  fire  and  brimestone - a good excuse as
any for a fire effect. OK, so  fire  effects have been done to death -
their impressiveness is almost burnt out  -  but this is done so well,
it makes other fire effects glow with envy. It is a roaring success.

Next we have some shade circles  drawn with three crosses superimposed
on them. Yes, its a god-squad demo, and the bible-bashing doesn't come
more righteous  than  this.  On  the  right  of  the  screen  we  have
quotations from the bible and  other  religious  messages. The read me
text file is  an  outpouring  of  hate  against  computers, coding and
computer users, saying that they  are  pointless.  You know you are in
trouble with a demo when  it  comes  in  two  versions: King James and
Luther! (We are just waiting for the Waco Cult remix!)

I'm not against people having a  belief,  but  I'm not sure its a very
good idea to have demos  promoting  political  or religious messages -
that's not really their  purpose.  Demos  are there for entertainment,
its as simple as that.

The messages on this  demo  are  unintentionally  funny as the coder's
grasp of English grammar isn't  very  hot.  "DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THESE DAYS?" he demands, proving  he  had  no divine intervention when
checking the grammar of the  scroller.  The misspelling of "repent" at
the end is also quite ironic.

The coders claim in the read me file that they didn't care if they won
the competition as they had no interest  in either it or computers any
more. They did actually get  an  award  for  their  demo, and did they
reject the materialistic prize? No, they marched through the crowds to
the stage with great grins on their  faces. A bit of hypocrisy there I
think.

Whilst the other read  me  files  are  friendly  and  jokey and extend
messages of warmth and friendship to other computer users, the Spirits
one does the opposite. They believe their faith makes them superior to
everyone else, who they have nothing but contempt for. How charitable.

Spirits say the only reason they made  this demo was to convert people
to Christianity, but it has  the  effect  of hardening people's hearts
against the religion. The bible is just a form of social control. Most
of the New testament was  written  40-100  years after the events they
report on, so great doubt must be  cast on its accuracy. Lets face it,

if there was a god would we  have  to  put up with Windows 95? I think
not.

CiH add-on ed note thing..

Yeah, there's something about fundamentalism  that attracts the morbid
and weird obsessive elements like  moths  to  a blowtorch.. I heard an
interesting little story a while ago from a friend who associates with
these kind of people.. You  can  be  having a normal conversation, and
then they say something which completely blows you away..

For example:-

Friends Wife.. "Gaw Blimey! (Jokingly)

God botherer.. "You mustn't say that, it's dangerous!!"

Friends Wife "But why not, it's just a harmless turn of phrase.."

God botherer.. "Ah, but if you  look  *closely* at the phrase it means
'GOD BLIND ME' and I'm sure you don't want that to happen!"

Friends Wife.. "?!?!?!?!?!" (Surprise)

And having attracted a fatwa from frenzied Spirits members onto my not
inconsiderable shoulders, I'll leave it at that!! - CiH
