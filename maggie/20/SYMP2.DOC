
                     SYMPOSIUM REPORT PART II

Ah Mr Bond, welcome back to Part II of this realtime article,, There is 
no  part  III,  not  at least if you are reading the  Falcon  version.. 
Different  story if it is the ST displayer though..  That *did* need to 
go into extra time.. Anyway, enjoy.. - CiH

Just how banal can you get??

The  last few pages sum up the whole afternoon perfectly,  where we just 
bullshitted on a grand scale and did nothing constructive.. Other things 
we *did* do was to respond to a mini-pretend flame war sort of thing  on 
the  DBA  realtime article,  where Slimer finally makes  the  connection 
between Robin Asquith and himself (fourteen hours after I wrote it  down 
on  their computer,  nice to see he reads back on his realtime text like 
all good editors should, if a little more slowly than usual ;-) 

Leon and Tat code on, and er, that's it..

As I am feeling tired again,  a hangover from the coach trip perhaps,  I 
go to lie down for a while in the sleeping room.. This is not vacant, as 
several people have 'coded until they dropped' and quite fancy the  idea 
of  a  nice little daytime kip,  instead of the usual nights rest..  You 
can't  keep  a  good Maggie editor down for long though,  or  even  this 
severly  deficient  one,  and  it is with a sense of  duty,  or  burning 
curiosity,  or  whatever,  that  I set off to look around again.  Of the 
others,  Felice  is  busy in the Internet Village/Cafe,  Leon is helping 
Arto  of  Hydroxid on his demo,  and Tat is doing strange things to  3-D 
objects..  Mike,  Kev,  and  Neil  all  tend  to drop in and out of  the 
realtime  article as the fancy takes them,  so keeping track of them  is 
quite easy..

One  thing  I watch are some of the ST guys running old demos,  all  the 
classics  from the golden years are there,  'Unlimited Matricks' and the 
'B-B-B-Bittner  Rap'  spring to mind particularly..  At least one  sound 
chip compilation demo with quite a fancy front end dated 1996 is  there, 
one I've not seen before?

The  next  high,  or  low-light of the day is tea,  served  promptly  at 
6.00pm, and consisting of more of those interminable pizzas!!

Well  okay,  here  it is again,  the second day was nothing if not  well 
documented by this realtime article text..

6.12pm
Where did the last two hours go?

It  is  as if nothing much happened,  and it didn't.  Loads of old demos 
shown - ok for people who have not seen them, but not for me.

Now  having tea,  and a couple of pizza (corrugated cheese and cardboard 
bacon) later, I'm feeling better. Taff is having a bacon sandwich of his 
own unique design,  bread roll and crispy bacon crunchy things wedged in 
the  middle - an updated version of that old school dinner  favourite  - 
crisp sandwiches. - CiH


6.20pm
Taffs  food  combinations  may  sound weird &  revolting  but  you'd  be 
surprised how good some of the stuff he cooks is - His Pasta chilly  and 
corn  beef  pie is mouthwatering!  He also cooks a mean roast dinner.  - 
Mike N.


6.21pm
Have we got the coach/train times sorted yet, Chris? - Felice

6.23pm
Nope! - CiH


6.24pm
Our realtime article is running where others have crashed.  The DBA text 
is  off the air at the moment as Tempus seems to have 'eaten'  the  text 
written  after  a  certain  point,   about  the  last  hours  worth?  An 
overheating  machine  was suspected.  This one was left on top of  Tat's 
borrowed monitor, and was quite warm to touch, but still 'booted up' and 
worked first time of asking, so...

Looks like DBA are back on, trying to restore what was lost? - CiH


6.46pm
There  is  a rumour going around that the organisers  of  Symposium  are 
5000DM short of what they expected because not as many people turned  up 
as they expected - not that there aren't loads of people here already. - 
Mike N.


7.07pm
Everyone has buggered off and left me all alone!! 
Taff is looking rather bored :-( Cheer up mate!

I'm looking forward to the MODs and GFX competitions but don't know when 
they start.  Soon I hope,  don't want to have to stay up too late to see 
them - not that I'm a part-timer or anything (Leon).  I'm just knackered 
generally.  Usually  I can go drinking and dancing on Friday night  from 
7pm to 3am and walk home and go to bed by 4am. Then I'm up by 11am for a 
trip  into  Sheffield for a legendary BIG Sandwich from  the  Great  Big 
Sandwich Shop.  If you ever come to Sheffield,  check it out. It's under 
the  NCP carpark near MacDonalds at the top of the Moore.  If you  don't 
know Sheffield, that won't mean anything. Never mind - Mike N.


7.18pm
Everyone is back - Hurrah! - Mike N.

7.20pm
A  couple of guys cooking on a primus stove *inside* the building!  Sure 
the organisers and conference people will love the fire risk! - CiH

7.21pm
Next time (next time?) We'll be better prepared! - Mike N.

7.21 and a half
In what way, pray tell me - Cast iron bum cheeks? - CiH

7.21 and three quarters
Good quality rubber rings for our poor bots - the Euro coach seat wasn't 
designed  with  British  bums  in  mind!  If not,  we'll  need  lots  of 
'Preparation H' or some 'Rectonal' - Mike N.

7.25pm
Tastes  delicious!  Off  to  see what DBA are up to,  if their film  has 
reached a 'climax' yet. - CiH

7.27pm
One  last thing before we leave the realtime article for a  while.  Just 
seen an ad for 'Toy Story' on the vid screen,  the Germans will miss out 
as  all the voices are overdubbed.  It's not the same without Tom  Hanks 
and Tim "Rod Man" Allen. - Mike N.


7.38pm
The film show around Sentry's video 
is breaking up for a while?

Do you think you can have *too much*
computer animation on a big screen?

CiH


8.00pm
Th' multichannel modfile compo has started. - CiH


19.04 (WHAT!)
ok then, 20.04
The mods 'a pumpin'.  So far they seem to be following the current trend 
of up-beat and major large bass,  but are,  as you would expect,  of the 
highest quality.  I've just been talkin' to a bloke about his Falcy,  he 
is  in the midst of fitting it into a standard PC case and to be  honest 
(guv) he has done a remarkable job. He advised me not to do it this way, 
so who knows, the rack idea I have is soundin' better - Taff!

20.10
I'll hang on a while before commenting on the MOD compo - CiH

"Washington droht Libyen Mit Luftangriff" 
(Meanwhile in the real world - Frankfurter Allgemeine - 6.4.96.)

20.14
Now translate it Chris. - Mike N.

20.15
'Washington  hits/threatens  Libya with air attack' at  a  (very)  rough 
guess? - CiH

20.15
Oh! World War Three!! (Oops, don't mention the War!) - Mike N.

20.17
"Bombs and bollocks" as Taff would say - Mike N.

20.20
In  about  35  hours  time,  we'll  be  in  Amsterdam  to  meet  Richard 
Karsmakers! - Mike N.

20.12
Cheer me up - go on mate! - CiH

20.22
We  could  hire  Richard to type this up.  I hear he's the  fastest  two 
finger typist in these parts - Mike N.

20.24
Chris  has just passed his editor's eye and correction pen over my  last 
bit. Sorry 'bout the silly "Typos" - Mike N.

20.25
I haven't finished yet! (CIH ED)

8.26pm
Is someone strangling a C64? - Taff

8.26.5PM
Yes, with it's own afterbirth! Feel the Sidchip rush overtake you! - CiH

20.28
A C64 farts better than a Speccy or ST! - Mike N.

20.29
A Fart in a bath sounds better than a YM soundchip in full squawk. - CiH

20.30
I can't wait for the ZX80 and ZX81 entries! - Mike N.

20.31
I  can!  Just shout "Techno Techno" over the top of these C64 tunes  and 
they're a fashion item again - CiH

20.32
Blink a lot at the same time to complete the effect.- Mike N.


20.40
Coke machine momentarily interrupts speakers horror? - CiH
Music compo has now ended?


20.51
Graphics compo in 10 minutes! - Mike N.

20.53
Everyone has gone again - Mike "Guardian of Realtime Article" Noyce


20.58
We haven't had a "Yeowww,  its hot in here!" sentence yet,  have we?  On 
the subject of heat, I've hardly needed to go to the loo today, and what 
urine there is has come out *very* concentrated looking - This is  spite 
of the fact that I've drunk 50 billion cans of coke or equivalent. Where 
does it all go?  
                         -  CiH sweating more than peeing?

21.02
I noticed that too,  but didn't like to say anything about the colour of 
my water.  I hope that we don't make up for the lack of toilet useage on 
the bus home! - Mike N.


9.20pm
Anyone  want  to  make some money?  Here's Tat's 'secret' recipe  for  a 
money spinner.
1) Write a game, the worse the better. Mech Warrior 2 is my example.
2) Spend  9 months hiding said game by  adding  pre-rendered  sequences 
    *everywhere*
3) Sell on 3 CD's for œ50. Voila! Tetris 2000!


9.25pm
I  think they must be recruiting new staff writers for ST Format.  - Two 
German  females  with zero knowledge of computers are being  quizzed  on 
stage.  Something  to  do with a demo they have allegedly  'written'  or 
something?

"How many bytes in a kilobyte?"   - "Eight hundred!!"

 and

"What is the reset key sequence for PC's?"  - "Amiga, Amiga, Control!"
 
I ask you!!

        Now about 400 people at the Symposium now - CiH


9.30pm
Watching an Amiga running some nice screens. Influenced by some PC demos 
I  remember  recently  seeing (Phong shading) - The PC demos  ran  in  a 
higher resolution though. - CiH

9.44pm
"Bad Taste" is now on TV. I like the film, tacky gore in the extreme!! - 
Mike N.

Again,  this  sums up rather neatly what we were thinking/doing over the 
early  evening  period..  The main 'event' was the multichannel  modfile 
compo which seemed to have to re-use the same samples mixed in different 
ways.. I doubt this was a real competition rule, it just seemed that way 
from where we were sitting!

I  don't know why the realtime broke into 24 Hour notation for  a  while 
when we hit eight pm?

The  major  attraction at the Dutch end was the cult  'sicky  vid'  "Bad 
Taste."  Quite apart from the very 'special' special  effects  involved, 
the  most  noteworthy aspect of the film was that,  like  Spiderman  the 
movie,  it  seemed  to date to a late seventies or very  early  eighties 
period,  with the two main characters having a strong resemblance to the 
heroes   of  that  great  Cops  n'  Guns  show  of  the   period,   'The 
Professionals!'  (It  was the Ford Capri that did it!  Great cars,  they 
were!!)

The  'showtrial' on stage of the two females involved a  demo  allegedly 
coded by them,or more probably, coded by their male partners in whatever 
relationship.  The  questions  were cruelly designed to show that  their 
"involvement"  was  a  put-up job,  as it seemed to be  once  they  lost 
control  over  the bytes in their head..  Not like us,  who have a fully 
working and distinctly non-token female member on the team (Hi Ripley!)

All  of this takes us to the first event of the evening  where  everyone 
takes an active interest, to whit, the graphics competition..

The various entries are shown,  one by one,  on the big screen.. Most of 
them are very good,  some of them follow fairly standard themes, that is 
girlie pin up or pop-art poster type work..  A great many of them cannot 
really be distinguished as computer pictures on the big screen, and look 
like  magazine illustrations or airbrush work..  One is rendered on NeoN 
and must have taken many hours to set up.. We also find out the depth of 
the rivalry between the Amiga and PC factions in the main hall when  one 
entry  comes on with a pro-PC (German language) caption..  A great roar, 
with  booing  and hissing rises up from the Amiga (cheap!)  seats..  The 
picture uses the "power" of a Pentium P90 to render it.. But we all know 
now that Pentium P90s are obsolete according to the latest  conventional 
wisdom.. (Personal Computer World May issue..)

The  end results of the graphics compo *are* high quality,  but DBA  are 
less than impressed by the derivative nature of the entries and say so a 
lot in their realtime text..  (But with everyone scrambling on board the 
multi-media  bandwagon,  and  trying  to give movie-like  qualities  and 
'realism' to software, the graphics compo entries are just right for the 
people  they are ultimately intended for - prospective employers at  big 
software houses!!)

The  next  major  'happening'  is  a  head-to-head  coding   competition 
involving the 4k intros on all the machines.. In the meantime, we bumble 
about a bit more,  so we won't return to the realtime just yet, as there 
was one new development we did not like at all!

For some reason, the big screen is showing the "cult" 'Plan 9 from Outer 
Space.' This was DEFINITELY the worst movie ever made,  as I sat through 
it  over ten years ago when I was a suffering student,  and wondered why 
afterwards..  Suicide  is too mild a form of escape from this crap,  and 
searching through such chunks of memory that are left from that  period, 
I  conclude  that I was taken in by the 'cult' label  attached  to  this 
movie  at  the  time,  expecting  the  outer layer  of  crapness  to  be 
transmogrified by an inner humourous irony,  or something.. Instead, the 
outer crapness stood aside to give the inner crapness a decent chance to 
have a go at the audience..

We,understandably,  did  not  hang around,  and returned to the sleeping 
room  and  that is where the nasty new development I  mentioned  earlier 
took place.. No, it was not 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' after all!! Fooled 
you, hahaha!

11.30pm
We  nearly  trip  over  several strange people who seem  to  be  in  the 
penultimate  stages  of a very deep,  and drunken sleep..  We check  our 
personal   goods  and  chattels,   seeking  a  reassuring  bite  of  our 
supermarket junk food,  and instead,  find several distressing shortages 
on  the  audit..  Mike  Noyce  is missing most of his  food  (the  dodgy 
partbaked  bread  rolls significantly remain untouched!)  Meanwhile,  my 
bottle of (weak) orange drink has diminished to a few meagre  dribbles.. 
Evaporation is not suspected,  and resisting the temptation to shoot the 
sleeping people on the grounds of 'innocent 'til proven guilty'* or some 
such schmuckoidal saying, we withdraw from the room at speed.. 

(*NB A more correct line of reasoning might be "murder is illegal and we 
haven't got any guns to shoot them with anyway!")  

Warning  Felice to remove his video camcorder pronto,  in case they  get 
thoughts  about more ambitious forms of pilfering,  we head to the  main 
hall once more,  as the coding competition is to start.. Mike and Kev go 
to  bed  about now,  to make sure nothing else is taken on  a  permanent 
'loan'  basis..  Which means they miss out on the coding competition and 
the excitement generated there..

The  coding  competition  is another of those events  that  are  heavily 
attended,  and  starts up with the Falcon entries for the 4K  category.. 
These turn out to be rather good,  probably the best section in terms of 
the overall standard of the entries.. 

The first intro is a rather good morphing vector grid,  which turns into 
all  sorts  of  3-D saucer and torus type objects,  all in a  very  high 
resolution which then at the end, returns itself to its original shape.. 
Some clapping, cheering and whistling from the rest of the hall..

The second entry is by those coding party animals Lazer, and consists of 
a  space  scene,  with a very Elite-like subtext..  Nifty  texturemapped 
space  ships  and space stations speed through a warp  tunnel  of  stars 
ending  in  a  series of explosions or hyperspace  escapades..  Lots  of 
cheering  and clapping at the end of that one..  Any chance of a  *game* 
based on those lovely spaceships, it would make me *very* happy!! (Plea-
note to Lazer from fed-up with puzzle games Maggie Ed!)

Next up, is something very different, a group called Spirits who produce 
something that can only be described as a 'Godtro'.. It comes in several 
parts,  which  sort  of  contravenes one of the main rules  for  the  4K 
category,  one  effect  only..  A spinning vector representation of  the 
world,  continents  in  outline  form  start up,  with  a  progressively 
creepier  religious  text on the right hand side..  The spinning  vector 
continents  burst  into flame,  then when the text gets really dire  and 
turns  into  threats,  a brilliant liquid bubbling flame comes into  the 
screen.  The  last  screen  is  an eclipse  like  scene  signifying  the 
resurrection..  Brilliant demo,  dubiously posed message..  This one get 
cheers when particular effects are onscreen..

DBA's  entry is next,  and that is a wavy distorty thing which says  '4K 
Intro' which lasts about thirty seconds.. (Done in GFA Basic??)

The  fifth and final entry is/by BSE and is a colourshock  plasma  shade 
bob type of affair which gets some cheers in the middle..
     
The  Amiga  intros  that follow are nice,  but constrained by  the  'one 
effect  rule',  don't  have quite the same impact as the  better  Falcon 
entries..

I  enjoyed this bit of the show,  certain others assessed the  situation 
slightly  differently,  DBA not being too happy with certain rules being 
flouted  (or  changed at the last minute?) Anyway,  the Mighty  Morphin' 
Maggie Editorial machine goes on further into the night, but firstly, to 
bring the realtime text kicking and screaming into the present..

10.15pm
Graphix  compo  just finished - very high standard -  some  stuff  looks 
professional  quality - one got an uproar from the Amiga crowd with  its 
pro-Pentium message- When will they learn??

Some looks a bit too professional and off-pat perhaps? Any of it Falcon? 
I don't recognise the artists. - CiH
 

10.30pm
The big screen is now showing 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' - The worst film 
ever made.  So crap,  it became a cult movie.  Now it is more of a post-
cult  thing where it became crap once again,  but in this hall at least, 
people  still take it more literally and it's still a cult..  PC  owners 
and Amiga people are sooo sad!! - (Shrugs shoulders) - CiH


11.30pm
I'm not best pleased as a discovery has been made in the sleeping  area. 
My  (mostly)  unconsumed) bottle of drink and Mike  Noyces  crisps  have 
disappeared.
The  bottle  was  suspiciously light but there was  no  spillage.  Mikes 
crisps  had  gone too.  So we conclude that someone who does not give  a 
stuff about other people is loose in the show.
Lesson learned, I don't take chances with important stuff like money and 
documents, keeping those with me, but a bottle of orangeade??
That is pathetic and whoever did this is a mindlessly small turd with no 
brain to speak of..

Just saw the 4Ktros,  head to head, Amiga vs Falcon. Very impressive one 
by  Lazer,  also  a  good one from Spirits, fiery world effect  -  heavy 
religious imagery, so almost a 'Godtro.'
Amiga intros not quite so good or plentiful - cheered up no end. - CiH

DAY FOUR..

After the coding competition finishes, Slimer and Bonus take a long time 
out  to  express their unhappiness with the way the  coding  competition 
went..  Felice and I are in the area, and over a beer, Slimer and I fall 
to talking and bullshitting about anything and everything, and generally 
the atmosphere turns very much mellower in a post-midnight sense..

The  next  thing  that happens is that I go to  visit  Therapy  who  are 
sitting  in  the  nearly empty front section of the  main  hall,  having 
cleared out of the overcrowded Atari room earlier..  They are pleased to 
show  me how their megademo entry for the competition  is  progressing.. 
Apart  from  the bits that don't work too well without a  dedicated  RGB 
monitor,  what is there is very nice and well presented,  and has a very 
good chance in the competition depending on what the other entrants  are 
up to.. (They subsequently win..)

Over another beer, Dodger also shows me his next serious project for the 
Falcon,  which is a image manipulation/convertor package that will leave 
all  others  gasping  in  its wake..  The convertor  part  is  the  most 
developed,  with  around 160 different formats supported,  including the 
most  popular animation ones!  The idea is total convertability,  so you 
are  not limited to converting to just a few image formats supported  by 
the  programmer,  so a Degas file can be changed to a Targa or PC  style 
.BMP file, and back again.. The program is speedier than the rest, as it 
is   written   in   assembler  for  tight   optimisation..   The   image 
manipulation/photo studio bit of the program will take the form of  add-
on modules.. It is called 'Smurf', and a demo should be freely available 
by the time you read this..

The  lone  ST coder is still at work,  parked right by the door  of  the 
sleeping room..

Back to the main hall, and sitting down with Leon and Tat for a while as 
they  are  helping Arto with some CyberSculpt made 3-D objects  for  his 
demo..  I get to see Tat at work here, also some fascinating previews of 
possible  new Lazer stuff are glimpsed over my shoulder..  The  Hydroxid 
demo is finished,  and one of the organisers comes over to collect it on 
his  Syquest drive..  This has some difficulty talking to Arto's Falcon, 
and  the  resulting confusion keeps us entertained for quite  a  while.. 
Arto  takes  the  opportunity  to grab a  few  choice  bits  off  there, 
including  a  copy of the rarely seen Independent Diskmag..  This  is  a 
zipfile  which  is  straightforward..  unzipping it is less so,  as  the 
zipfile is password protected!!  Arto has to delete most of it,  because 
the  Indy Diskmag is an internal release only..  (And mostly in German I 
would suppose, so he did not miss a lot!) 

Leon  seems  to be working on something as well,  which falls  into  the 
Senior Dads category, but looks more like a game than a demo..

In  quite  a  good  mood now,  I write up the last of that  day  on  the 
realtime article and go to bed at about 3.30am

Yes,  still here.  I sort of stayed up with Slimer, got sidetracked into 
having  a good look at Therapy's new demo for the party,  also a preview 
of a new GFZ converter called 'SMURF'. Then latterly here with Leon, Tat 
and  a  French  chap from Hydroxid called 'Arto' - Thank  you  for  that 
(French chap writes in name at this point.)

There is a certain suggestion  from looking over Leon's  shoulder that a 
new  Senior  Dads  production might be in the air,  but  Tat  needs  his 
machine back for 3-D objects to do for Hydroxid.

Also sort of glimpsed Lazer doing stuff - you don't seem to see anything 
much  in  the  day,  but  these coders like to come out  to  play  after 
midnight!

By the way,  I think the Falcon 4K intros were f*cking ace,  in spite of 
what  DBA  said about the entry rules - there seemed to  be  differences 
between the coding competition entry rules and the 4K intro rules, or so 
I think I've been told?? - CiH

3.30ish
Bed  is  the  same place as last night,  only the  room  is  different.. 
Hundreds  of drunk and snoring Amiga/PC owners pack the place  out.  For 
some reason,  the room is very cold,  as in the sort of coldness you get 
if  one side of the building has been pulled down to make way for  fresh 
air.. Pushing my misgivings to the back of my mind I settle down..

7.30ish
...And wake up again,  the room is very cold,  very crowded, and the air 
resonates with some of the most unbelievable snoring heard this side  of 
a doss-house in one of the grubbier bits of Hamburg..  Additionally, the 
primus stove users have been doing their thing in here to, so the air is 
not  only freezing,  it is also thick with the stench of gas or paraffin 
fumes so my lungs don't feel too great.. I resolve to leave ASAP, and as 
it  is  our  last day in this hall,  deflate and pack away  the  airbed, 
hastily  at first,  then once outside into the reassuring warmth of  the 
main hall, pack my bag more neatly, look quickly at the unmoving form of 
the unknown ST coder slumped over his machine once more, and head off to 
see who else is up..

After  registering my disquiet on the DBA realtime article,  I find  Kev 
Davies  (Taff) is also up,  and we settle down to make breakfast out  of 
whatever we've got left of our food..

The realtime admirably picks up the story again at this point..

                  Day Three (or is it two and a half?)

8.00am
Happy Easter Sunday - CiH back after a very poor nights "sleep" - 3.30am 
to 7.30am, much of which broken by door opening, voices in German people 
trampling around, and some snoring totally out of this world. Most of it 
was  the 'usual' gurgling and similar noises.  The one that beat the lot 
was  a  two  channel 'SID chip Snore' where the  guy  not  only  managed 
rythmic  gurgling,  but  also  gave us a rising and falling  chorus  not 
unlike a SIDsynth wave! The Amiga owners packed themselves in tight, the 
room was flippin' freezing,and seemed to stink of paraffin fumes.

I got up out of it fairly quickly and found Kev Davies.  Now we are both 
sitting  here,  breakfasting  on coke and Buffalo Bill  tortilla  chips, 
which are hot and slightly stale, but not much else.

As I said, Merry Xmas! - CiH


08.08
CiH  seems too be in some kind of temporal time warp,  or maybe its just 
that time of day. Who knows? And why am I awake?

No matter,  now back to the Sultan of the spoken,  er,  written word.  - 
Taff


8.12am
Well  this  Sultan is going to hang up his pen  awhile  until  something 
happens - Bye for now - CiH


8.12 and a half
Probably for the best - Taff


8.57am
It's  Easter Sunday!  I can't believe I'm up so early on a Sunday!!  The 
Argentinian Grand Prix is due to start 4pm (CET) I'll probably miss  it, 
but I've met some F1 fans who might watch it - Somehow.

Unlike Chris, I had a really good nights sleep, interrupted at about 2am 
by  someone who kicked or walked over me.  I'm off to see if the toilets 
are free yet. - Mike N.

We next wander back over to the Dutch pits to see what they are  doing.. 
As I seat myself comfortably,  it is about now,, that the assorted might 
of the DBA coding section springs into action, as they decide they might 
quite  like  a go at the Falcon 96K intro section..  They have  somewhat 
less  than an hour to spare before the entry deadline,  but this is  how 
they  like  to  work best!!  Several pre-written  routines  are  hastily 
slammed together in a mixture of rastery snaky things and modfiles..

Meanwhile, just a few feet away, Sentry are putting the final touches to 
their  proper entry,  whilst being badgered by an organiser to make  the 
deadline.. Nice to see the organisers doing something at last!!

Incredibly,  it looks like the DBA entry is put together in 45 minutes.. 
Not  exactly going to give the likes of Lazer sleepless nights,  but not 
bad for the (lack of) time involved.. 

Meanwhile,  trying  to  prove,  or disprove the old adage that the  best 
ideas  often  come from sitting on the toilet,  I feel motivated to  try 
writing  an  article on a spare DBA keyboard..  Slimer obliges,  and the 
'DIY  cut out and keep guide to coding conventions' is written in  about 
an  hour..  It must have been the atmosphere of hard work permeating the 
convention  which  tempted me to have a go..  Or it could have been  the 
paucity  of articles for the next issue of DBA mag apparent on  Slimer's 
hard drive.. Or I could have been very bored at that time!?!

11.00am
A  Minor  measure of possible revenge against the phantom  orange  juice 
drinker  of old Hamburg Town,  as one of our party (Mike?) turns up with 
some  'free' cans taken from the faulty coke machine..  I hope that  the 
person  who didn't get their drink from the machine was the same  person 
who stole our stuff last night!

Another pleasant surprise was the early opening of the Pizza bar..  They 
are  actually serving food other than Pizzas!!  A couple of rather  nice 
Cheese  salad and mayonnaise rolls,  and a cup of coffee later,  and the 
world is a much better place to inhabit.. 

12.00ish
Tat  seems  to  be finally awake from his second night  slumped  on  the 
keyboard,  and  seems  to  be working on a heat-haze or  shimmery  title 
screen  for  the  Absence/Independent combined entry to  the  main  demo 
competition..  When Leon gets some machine time, he is working some more 
on his game, which turns out to be a boat race simulator!

It  boasts  minimal  (drawn by Leon!) graphics,  no sound,  but tons  of 
gameplay for two players..  The control system owes a lot,  in fact owes 
everything,  to  the  ancient  Ocean Software  classic,  Daly  Thompsons 
Decathlon,  as  you punch two keys up and down vigorously to simulate  a 
rowing  action..  This  works  really  well,  with one race  where  Taff 
snatches  back an early lead that Leon took..  (Hopefully a release  for 
Maggie??)

The  next  thing  that happens at this point  is  the  protracker  (four 
channel) modfile competition,  but in the meantime, the realtime article 
is still stuck at 9am, desperately thumbing for a lift to the present..

10.08am
Spent awhile in the DBA quarter where they did an 'hourtro' (45 minutes) 
in  GFA  Basic.  Fairly simple thing but impressive for the time  period 
involved.

Organisers hassling for finished demo and Sentry's entry too.  Fine, but 
like where was the shuttle bus when we needed you! - CiH


10.20
The time 10.20, the place, Symposium '96,the news...erm...well

DBA  have  just  finished  their 96K intro  and  it  looks  pretty  good 
considering  it was written in 45 minutes using GFA Basic,  nothing new, 
but  nailed  together  nicely.  Sentry are just  putting  the  finishing 
touches  to  theirs  but are having a couple  of  problems  (but  that's 
assembly programming for you.) Oh yeah, Tat and Leon are still asleep... 
In different sleeping bags of course!?! - Taff


11.10am
Good,  someone's  been  minding  the shop whilst I've  been  away.  I've 
actually gone and written an *article* for DBA mag.

From an idea I had sitting on the toilet, well they haven't got too much 
yet. Does this translate as "I'm very bored?"

Tat  is  just  about  back  with us - seems to  be  the  main  topic  of 
conversation on the DBA text at the moment. - CiH

11.16am
At  last,  something  other than f*cking Pizza and crisps -  the  cheese 
salad roll saviour is now serving at the counter - real coffee too!!
   
  CiH now gratefully sated


12.40pm
Not  been  too keen lately.  Modfile (4 channel protracker)  competition 
thing - Thump thump bleep bleep Yippee!!

Applause in the main hall definitely muted.

Leon starts latest Senior Dads thing, a boat race in time? - CiH


12.45??
Well, I had a great nights sleep. Still feel tired though! CiH was right 
about  the  MOD  compo.  A  quick taster for you..  "Ooof,  ooof,  ooof, 
ooof..." I think you get the idea. 
                                   - Neil


12.48pm
Some of the mods were ok.  But too house/Rave for me.  So many people do 
these  type of tunes and they all start to sound the same,  apart from a 
few  noticeable tunes.  I like more original stuff other than mainstream 
technos.  There was a tune which used guitar samples which I thought was 
pretty good. - Mike N.

The  floor is busy once again,  but in a disorganised manner..  A little 
fit of depression bears down on us as we are in a frame of mind that  we 
will be leaving in the early evening,  that is, myself, Felice, Mike and 
Kev,  Leon  Tat and Neil are staying as they are students with  infinite 
supplies of holidays..

The  protracker competition is spoken about quite well in  the  realtime 
text, so does not need any more writing up here..

I also visit the Internet village with Felice, who seems to know his way 
to the interesting Web pages, IE. Lazer's and DBA's!

Lots of coding type activity seems to be going on, I explore a bit more, 
and  I am richly rewarded when I spot the intriguing label 'SID  inside' 
on an ST music demo. More of that later.. 

Well dammit.. Here it is again..

1.20pm
A  disorganised  time,  most  people sitting around doing little  -  Tat 
trying  to  show  the 'best side' of a  rather  raggedy  texture  mapped 
chesspiece.  Slimer has emerged from hiding to talk to us. Leon happened 
to be demoing DBA Mag issue 12 to Arto - We will be going too soon.

Speaking to Harald of Lazer who is unsure of a Lost Blubb sequel.

Slimer is on the 'Fried Bits was much better than this party' trawl - 
Looking forward to when we can tell the difference. As party Virgins, we 
still had a good time in spite of the odd rough patch - (or eight!)

1.40pm
Caught a glimpse of something called 'SID Inside' Atari ST music demo by 
Tom G? - Possible compo entry?? - CiH


1.50pm
Hello,  I  am  Hans "Mr Ni" Wessels.  Your reporter tricked me into some 
writing  for  the mag.  Well,  currently,  my main interest is writing a 
compression  program for the ST (and all other computer systems too  but 
my development system is a 1040 ST, 4MB inside, 20 mhz speeder, six hard 
disks, total diskspace, 730 MB, autoswitch, overscan (res enhancer, high 
res = 720 x 480)

Most  of you might have heard about the ARJ packer,  thats the program I 
am working on,  but mostly as a compression program on the wrong system, 
MS  DOS.  Some  years  ago Ger "Insh Allah" Hobbelt  converted  the  ARJ 
depacker  to  the  Atari platform.  In that time,  there were  more  ARJ 
depackers for the ST around.

After  I heard from a friend that he usually used another  depacker  for 
ARJ  because  that one was faster,  I started to optimise the  depacker. 
While I was optimising the depacker,  Ger was implementing all depacking 
related options of the original DOS packer in our depacker. At a certain 
moment,  we had unarj 2.41 rev.  (Well,  I don't know anymore!) with all 
possible options included like multiple volume support and decompressing 
password  protected archives,  someone asked us if we could make an  arj 
packer.

The  problem with arj is that only the depacker source is available.  So 
we had to write the packer from scratch.  Two years ago we had the first 
beta  version ready.  Since then I did a lot of optimising both on speed 
and  compression  factor.  By  now ARJ ST is the best packer on  the  ST 
platform.  A  GEM  shell is under development and we are working on  the 
conversion  to  other  platforms:  It's even better than  the  original. 
Within a few months,  I expect GNU ARJ (that's the name now) 10.xx to be 
released on multiple platforms.

(Gasp! - Ed)


14.20
Adding just a teeny bit of history to the above ("Insh-Allah" aka  G.E.G 
Hobbett):

It indeed all started by simply converting the ARJ depacker to the Atari 
ST/TT?Falcon series (a command line driven tool:  .TTP).  As Hans wrote, 
he has spent now about 2 years of continuous effort on creating suitable 
compression algorithmes,  and optimising them to run as fast as possible 
on Motorola MC68K processors.

Where  do  we  come  from?  Both of us are from the  East  part  of  the 
Netherlands,  more specifically Twente.  Some folks will know that we're 
members of the 5 member TOS Crew: Hans is the only one of us who created 
demo's  (Demounsterous Demo,  among others) Me,  I wrote a GEM-based MOD 
and  MUS  (Chipsound)player,  and  of course,  the aforementioned  UNARJ 
tools.

The ARJ compressor tool is available in Beta version on Atari;  Ports to 
other machines (UNIX!)are overdue, but those will be ready quite soon (I 
hope (grin)). Want to know more.

Thanks guys for that mega pages worth!
Gives me a rest. 

Found out more about the 'SID Inside' - it is a hardware project - a SID 
chip  bolted onto the chassis of a humble ST,  with a socketable version 
soon  for  the Falcon.  The demo in question is to be entered  into  the 
'Wild' category - Anything goes, in other words. - CiH

Now going to get a sneak preview of this SID/ST hybrid machine..

- An old 520ST. Kind of ironic if it blew up now! - CiH

Yes,  it works - runs in parallel with the YM,  you could have up to six

The floor is busy,  but in a more casual "Hey, we've got the competition 
entries out of the way,  so lets party!" sort of manner.. I watched with 
some  interest,  wondering if I would ever get the realtime article back 
as  Hans  and  co wrote great chunks into  the  realtime  article..  The 
'SID-Inside'  is  indeed  a hardware project of a  very  unusual  kind.. 
Andreas shows me the SID inside putting sound through the ST  speakers.. 
Only  a little demo with a simple tune,  but it is real SID sound to  be 
sure..  A  Falcon  version which fits into the expansion port  is  being 
developed as well,  and hopefully some adequate music player software to 
go with it as well...

We  may well follow this story up further - watch out in a future  issue 
of Maggie!

We four who are going back are packed, and more or less ready to go, and 
aware that we will be leaving in the early evening.. There is still time 
to see the 96K Intro competition before we leave.. 

We  gather  in the main hall once more to see what is coming  up  here.. 
Hopes  for  something along the lines of the stunning 4K Intros  do  not 
quite  go to plan..  First up is Sentry's entry,  a two part thing which 
starts off with a bit of phong shading (the 'in' demo effect this year?) 
and then a half-size zooming picture which also moves about the screen.. 
A reprise and enhancement to an earlier screen that Sentry did..

Some  applause  at the end,  but that might have been for the  start  of 
DBA's  entry,  which  picked up more cheering during its  showing..  The 
third  entry  is from ADM and consists mainly of a textured  cube  which 
zooms back and forth and starts rotating around.. A plasma burst and end 
credits  to  finish..  And  those  are the only three  entries  to  that 
competition..  The  standard is disappointing compared with last  year's 
Fried  Bits entries,  or the recently shown 4K intros (without  decrying 
the  hard work put into the competition..) The only difference  apparent 
from the 4K intros, that these entries supplied their own music!

Anyway,  here  are  the  final realtime despatches from  the  convention 
site..

Just watched the 96k intro's.  Pretty good. I was quite impressed by the 
second  C64  demo   with a flaming vector cube in only  4K.  The  Falcon 
intros were the best. Well done DBA and Sentry!! - Mike N.

*Sob!* Fear not,  let us depart into the unknown in confidence (etc,etc) 
This will be my last contribution to the doc (apart from the 6 sheets of 
paper CiH is taking with him) so I'd just like to say:

    - How much fun it's been
    - How poor the compo entries have been
    - How the hell do you sleep on coaches??

This  is  more  or  less it for us..  The  main  demo  competition,  the 
highlight of the day, will not be seen by us, although it turns out that 
I  have  had a pretty good look at the two main entries  to  the  Falcon 
section  whilst  they were being finished..  (There should hopefully  be 
another  report  that  picks up what happened later that  night  at  the 
Symposium.. (Leon??)

Some  of  us try out our first fresh air in the last  couple  of  days.. 
Incredibly,  in  a  country that is closed on Sunday,  there is a nearby 
garage  shop  open,  with the usual range of garage-type food and  drink 
available.. Still steering clear of the minature Mars Bars, we stock up, 
including a can of 'LIPTONICE LEMON TEA!' a drink which was sold briefly 
off  the  back of a dodgy advertising campaign  starring  Angus  Deaton, 
which then sunk out of sight completely in the UK about a year ago.. 

Wandering  back to the show,  at least one story about those other party 
goers who owned the A***Word machine..  There is a pond/lake outside the 
restaurant,  not  exactly  inviting swimming material..  In fact all  it 
needed to complete the dismal atmosphere was a sign saying 'Get your cut 
price   Cholera  here!'  (In  German  of  course)  Some  of   the   more 
impressionable  A*iga owners were convinced to swim this  fetid  looking 
water for the worthwhile reward of an official Symposium T-Shirt! Mature 
and clever, or what??

 ++Departure home!++

About 6.15pm
All  good things come to an end,  and even all slightly dodgy things  as 
well..  We say goodbye to as many people as we can find, and set out for 
the bus stop to do our journey/ordeal in reverse order..  Tat, Neil, and 
Leon  are  to  walk with us to the bus stop,  and Tat briefs us  on  the 
parrot fashion phrase which should get us tickets to get us all the  way 
to  the Hauptbanhof..  After a brief delay for the organisers to find  a 
knife (??) to cut us free from our plastic tags, we are off!

The bus, in a departure from normal practice, actually turns up on time, 
and  in a reversal from last time,  I manage to get the only free  seat, 
knowing how deadly this bus can be to unsuspecting standing passengers.. 
Tat, Leon and Neil wave goodbye and go back to the show..

The  train is,  as before,  the most straightforward bit of this part of 
the  journey,  and before not too long (about 7.30pm) we are back at the 
bus station..

The bus station is somewhat deserted. We try some waiting here, but with 
four  hours  to  kill  before  our coach sets  off  for  the  perils  of 
Amsterdam,  we decide we would like to wait somewhere else..  The nearby 
MacDonalds  is  open,  so we go there,  having overcome our fear of fast 
food  restaurants  and  cafe knifemen..  Ordering food,  even with  very 
little  German is easy,  so there is no repeat of the foodless fiasco of 
Friday  as we sit down to eat,  and generally indulging in some  serious 
slaying of time..

In this pastime, the realtime article proves invaluable, a flat surface, 
pen and paper being available..

Mike tried to use the toilets here, but the counter staff keep the key..
The story behind that is that some people tend to go into public toilets 
in Hamburg and then die of an overdose, as Tat told us. - CiH

It has just occurred to me (again) Mike N.  left a bottle of milk on the

No doubt, cheese awaits us on our return. - Taff

Well  many such topics of conversation are dissected on the flat  marble 
slab of boredom, life, loves, and Falcon Tower cases..

We move back into the bus station about 9.30ish, anticipating the ticket 
office  opening  at  10.00pm..  A few more people are  gathered  in  the 
station as well..  Ticket office opens,  and a few more people turn up.. 
We  book  in,  attaching  more labels to our tired looking  bags..  More 
people turn up, then at about 10.30, someone throws a switch so that the 
bus station becomes a beehive of furious movement and arriving coaches.. 
We sit patiently for ours, and are rewarded as a bus with our name on it 
(Hell Coaches Incorporated) arrives..  For the only time on this trip in 
either direction we manage to get seating together.. I get a window seat 
and  Mike Noyce next to me,  Kev and Felice keep each other amused  just 
behind us..

The coach seems to take quite a while to set off,  and we end up talking 
to  an  anglo-german  couple in the seats  opposite..  This  kills  time 
admirably  until we start to pull out of Hamburg..  The Liptonice  Lemon 
Tea goes down at this point..

By the uncanniest of coincidences, the coach drives right past Hittfeld, 
probably at the sort of time that the demo competitions are being run..
We  half expect to spot some Falcon owners thumbing a lift home  on  the 
Autobahn..  Just  one  more stop before the serious business of  another 
sleepless  night,  as we pull into the very same service station that we 
stopped  at  on  the  way  in!  - A few  more  supplies  and  a  moments 
relaxation later, and we are on our way once more..

DAY FIVE..
There  is even less sleep to be found on this coach,  compared with  the 
journey  in,  if  that is at all possible,  everyone in front plays  the 
'reclining  seat shuffle' so I have to move back myself to  avoid  being 
flattened, an arrangement which does not suit Felice too well.. Attempts 
to try lying 'comfortably' in different poses uses up some time, as does 
keeping an eye out for when we change countries back to Holland..

6.30am??
Memory  manages to wipe itself of the many hours it takes us to  get  to 
Amsterdam.. Shortly after the sky starts to change colour from night, we 
arrive at a most unpromising location, this is the Amstel Bus Station..

The coach is going on to the Hague without us, so we unload and wait for 
the  London connecting coach which is due to leave at about 9.00am..  We 
are also at this location for another reason..  At first,  there is very 
little  life,  the  Eurocoaches office/Portakabin remains very  closed.. 
There  is  very  little anticipation at this unearthly time  of  day  as 
Richard  Karsmakers  arrives  unannounced..  You would have  expected  a 
fanfare at the very least!

We  don't  know  what he looks like,  but someone matching  his  general 
description, as previously given, is walking about the station.. This is 
a  very  lucky break for both of us,  as he only had a very  vague  idea 
where  to  meet up,  and we did not know what he really looked like..  I 
approach  this  possible Karsmakers,  and after 1.5 seconds  of  initial 
confusion,  strike lucky!  To describe him more adequately,  he does not 
look  like a heavy metal fan,  indeed more like someone training to be a 
country priest!

Introductions  all round,  spirits lift,  the realtime article comes out 
for a brief burst of activity..

7.00am (Extra wobbly handwriting time)
Fuck coach journeys - this one is the worst yet.  Took five hours longer 
than it needed to -

However, Rich Karsmakers did make it here and is now standing in the
muck and grime of the bus station 
                                   - CiH
 
07.02
Crikey!  Never  thought  I'd  ever meet these guys and,  well,  now  I'm 
actually am. I'm still aghast and a bit shakey too (the "I'm not worthy" 
syndrome).  As  a  matter of fact,  I'm so stunned I've forgotten how to 
write!

(Mumble mumble mutter, doing paper real time sucks, mutter mumble)

7.10am
Another nightmare coach journey ends as we are dumped unceremoniously in 
the Amstel station.
No  sleep  yet  again,  as the seats are even  more  uncomfortable  than 
before.  Nice  to  see Rich K.  though.  he isn't sure if he is having a 
party for the end of ST News, at least when?

No  worthwhile writing surface here,  so we'll wind this up on the ferry 
as planned. - CiH

There  is no cafe open so we do not get the chance to  'do'  breakfast.. 
However,  with  some proper daylight outside,  we go outside to pose for 
the  obligatory group photo,  Felice is on the ball with his  camcorder, 
and a fragment of our conversation is preserved onto tape..

"ST News cap?? I thought you said ST News CAT!" and so on..

Rich  K.  is very helpful in looking after our baggage as the rest of us 
undergo  (for  the  last time!) the protracked and  tedious  booking  in 
procedure for the London coach..

It is time to go all too soon and goodbye is a hastily grabbed sentiment 
as  we load our own bags on (driver cleverly standing aside to let  *us* 
do  the  work..)  and  scramble to get a seat..  Due  to  a  fundamental 
miscalculation,  I get one of the "comedy" back row seats, the one right 
in the middle of the aisle which does not let you lean back properly  if 
the  people sitting next to you are built like/are South African  centre 
forwards..  Taff is sitting nearby,  but is not in the mood for detailed 
conversation right now..  The whole of the rest of the coach is not in a 
conversational  frame  of mind either,  apart from the driver,  who is a 
bluff  no-nonsense type..  He ends up his induction talk with a  warning 
not  to  use aerosols on the coach as he is allergic to  these,  and  we 
would be "Lucky if he managed to steer the coach to the side of the kerb 
in time."

The  day  is  unpromising steel-grey and  chill,  perfect  Bank  Holiday 
weather in other words.. 

We  stop after a little while at a service station for a bite  of  Dutch 
MacDonalds, which taste uncannily similar to the German variety.. Still, 
that is breakfast solved, and back on the coach, I try to make myself as 
comfortable as possible, sort of managing to lean back a bit as we cross 
the Belgian border.. 

Sleep  and  coaches  being  mutually impossible,  I  pass  the  time  by 
hallucinating instead..

Now  the  radio  was  on,  and  turned down  really  low..  It  was  not 
particularly  tuned  into  anything,  although random  stations  drifted 
across the ether.. In the time between that Netherlands bite to eat, and 
the  approaches  to  Calais,  I  must have composed a  couple  of  dozen 
Commodore  64  style SID chip tunes,  about half a dozen of  them  being 
really good,  the rest mediocre, but suitable for a bog-standard game or 
something.. Amazing what road noise, static, and extreme tiredness do to 
the senses!!

In  spite of everything else,  our driver knows what he is about,  as we 
approach  Calais an hour earlier than expected,  I wind up my concert in 
the head as he tells us that a lot depends on the attitude of the French 
Customs..  These are as unpredictable as a serial killer offering a lift 
home,  and he tells us some worryingly 'entertaining' tales of what they 
like to do to uncooperative passengers..

However,  they  wave  us through,  and a brief check of passports on the 
ferry terminal later, we are free to go!

2.30pm
The ferry waits,  the sun comes out,  and it looks like quite a nice day 
here.. The coach starts up again, and we drive up the ramp once more..

The ferry is an extension of UK territory,  so we are back to using good 
old pounds and eating proper sized Mars bars again.. Acting on some good 
advice given to us by our ubiquitous driver (get to the front of the bar 
or  else  you'll  still be queuing when the ferry docks  at  Dover!)  We 
settle down with some pints of beer and some very dry sandwiches..

The realtime article is brought out for the very last time here..

2.44pm, no hang on, it's 1.44 GMT now..
We've made it back to the ferry, MV Stella Invicta.

After  our  chilly  Amsterdam  interlude with Richard  K,  a  less  than 
remarkable coach journey ensues,  with everyone zonked out.  The drivers 
on  form  though,  as we get there an hour earlier.  The day starts as a 
chilly steel-grey typical bank holiday weather..

It has brightened up now,  and we sit suitably refreshed, ready to close 
down the realtime article. 

Mike, what did you think, any last minute sayings? - CiH


2.47pm
I  enjoyed  it,  Chris,  Meeting  loads of Atari dudes,  and of  course, 
Richard  Karsmakers this morning.  Great guy!  I'd do it again for sure. 
Time to sign off, methinks. Bye for now. Until next time. Bye. - Mike N.

Man overboard?!


2.55pm or 1.55pm
No, not quite. thank goodness.
I  enjoyed this entire weekend - culminating in seeing  Rich  Karsmakers 
this  morning & seeing the guys from the Dutch & German scenes.  I would 
do it all again for sure! - Felice

Well  at  1.56pm GMT,  I pronounce this realtime article well and  truly 
CLOSED!! -  CiH

We  settle  down,  and  do the usual ferry-type  activities  and  wander 
around..  There  is  no repetition of the 'cobbled sea' traumas  of  the 
journey over,  and in fact,  the view from the top deck is very pleasant 
if  a bit chill and breezy..  Back in the bar area,  a rugby club outing 
entertains  with a traditional selection of songs..  Felice loads up  in 
the  Duty Free shop,  and before too long,  sunny Dover is staring us in 
the face..

Back on the coach,  and one last hurdle to wriggle under,  as we have to 
clear  the  UK  customs..  Our ever-helpful driver advises "If  you  are 
smuggling, then thank you for travelling Eurolines and goodnight!"

Customs is easy... At first...

We  all  go through,  and back onto the coach,  a baggage search is  not 
carried  out,  which means a lot of time saved,  but we are left waiting 
just  the  other  side of that barrier,  as our driver,  looking  *very* 
pissed off has to sort out a little matter of a couple of passengers who 
are not going on to travel with us..  Something to do with illegal entry 
or  theft?  So  we were a couple of people lighter when we set  off  for 
London half an hour later..

I  don't pay too much attention to the journey back to  London,  getting 
over  the initial surprise of driving back on the LEFT hand side of  the 
road again..  London is a lot easier than when we were going out, and at 
about 5.30 or 6.00pm (GMT) we are back at London Victoria,  where it all 
started..  Kev  and  Mike  have  a whole other  coach  journey  back  to 
Sheffield  to wait for,  Felice and I the train to St Neots,  so we part 
and begin the final leg of the voyage home..

A  (not very) brisk stroll to the Underground station,  and a tube takes 
us to Kings Cross Station..  We have timed it quite well, as a half-hour 
wait  gives us time for some more of that famous  international  cuisine 
(Burger  King  this time) and still allows us to catch our  train..  The 
remaining  time  we have to wait,  sitting comfortably on the  train  is 
exquisite  in its brevity..  The journey is over before we really notice 
it, and we get off at St Neots an hour later..

9.00pm??
A  taxi  back to Felice's place,  and the journey ends for him..  I have 
been  noticing that my feet are swelling up like mad,  but I still  have 
the last twenty miles to complete by car, my own car!!

Spirits revive,  and I am in quite a good frame of mind as I drive home, 
free  to  use  my  own choice  of  transportation,  the  journey  nearly 
completed as I drive the few final twisty miles down the A45 at far  too 
unsensible a speed..

Get home and manage to:
1. Phone home to say that I am still alive and very tired.
2. Have a bath. 
3. GO TO BED (10.48PM GMT in bright red LED things on my alarm clock was 
   the last thing I remember seeing..)

Stay  crashed  out for quite a long time,  and do not bother to  get  up 
until the next afternoon..

                               ---End---

Symposium, a summing up?

Well,  what a time we all had,  tired out, threatened, Danish vocabulary 
expanded  by two very rude words,  and we didn't even see the main  demo 
competition!! From the views of certain others, perhaps too much time at 
this party was spent bemoaning the loss of the old one!!

Falcon demo wise,  it really missed out by not having a full ensemble of 
the  other international scenes..  The coders that were there tended  to 
assume that someone else was going to do the really big,  event-defining 
demo,  and apart from the 4K intros,  what was there,  was very nice but 
not groundbreaking..

Some people on another real time article were worried that the Falcon is 
dying..  What  we  saw proved that the Falcon is in very  good  health.. 
Those  people who had not produced much for the demo community  came  to 
Symposium  with  several game previews instead..  'Doomino'  has  become 
'Running',  and  should  be  finished  soon,  we  also  came  away  with 
'Skyfall', 'X-Moon', and 'Painium Disaster' previews which went some way 
to making up for the lack of demos this year.. 

It  was  not  as if all demo related activity had come to  a  dead  stop 
either  as a lot of interesting new things were being shown  on  peoples 
hard drives,  albeit in a half-completed state.. There should be lots of 
new productions over the coming months which will be well worth  looking 
out for..

The  people  at  Symposium  were all that we hoped  for..  Some  of  the 
friendliest and nicest people on the Atari,  just about everyone with an 
excellent  grasp of English,  and almost falling over themselves to show 
us around their creations..  I enjoyed meeting many of the personalities 
behind  the  scene..  All of them were worthy (Greets to everyone  there 
perhaps?) I don't like to say a lot about anyone on the other computers, 
as they kept to themselves in their own corner,  and a definite hatemail 
of a high explosive nature is travelling to the food thieves who  raided 
our sleeping bags..  (Tip for next time, keep some coke with a mega dose 
of laxative as bait for these scum!!)  

Finally,  you  might like to consider the curious case of the  Commodore 
64..  A  computer  that is out of production for many long  years,  that 
should,  by  all  current depressing commercial logic,  be dead.. At the 
Symposium,  this  "dead"  system  produced  demos that  put  many  newer 
machines  to  shame!!  If the coders active on the old 'commy can  still 
make  it  happen  even  now,  then there is no  reason  why  the  Falcon 
shouldn't be around for some time to come!!

It is really up to you, people!!
