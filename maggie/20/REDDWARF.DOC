                      The other Red Dwarf book..

                             By Rob Grant

Only  scant  months after our issue 18 review of Last Human,  the  long 
awaited  Red Dwarf third novel by Doug Naylor,  the *fourth* Red  Dwarf 
novel  by  the  other half of the script-writing duo  creeps  into  our 
bookshops unannounced..  We overcome our initial surprise, whip out our 
credit  card with some haste for a purchase and rush home to  sit  down 
and read the thing..

Actually,  there  were hints in the third book that Rob Grant was going 
to do his own 'third' book, but little did we realise etc..

Backwards  is  more  faithful to the plot laid out  by  the  first  two 
novels, in that is does not skim over the time spent on the 'Backwards' 
alternative  universe..  'Last  Human',  although an entertaining story 
ends  to  skim  over  a  lot  of  things,  such  as  Rimmer's  multiple 
personality problems,  explained away in a sentence here, but gone into 
in much more detail in Backwards.. 

Backwards tends to be a slow unfolding book, as we find out what Lister 
did  on his thirty-odd years on the Backwards Earth..  We find out that 
he  unserved a prison sentence for a murder he did not  commit,  indeed 
where  Kryten brought a hillbilly to life by pulling an axe out of  his 
chest! 

The  character of Ace Rimmer,  the alternative heroic version of Rimmer 
is explored in more detail here,  and eventually interacts with our own 
characters..  The  circumstances  that formed the different aspects  of 
Rimmer were also written about in much more detail..

The real Rimmer is more of the smeghead that we expected him to be, and 
gets  a less sympathetic treatment in this book..  Indeed his demise is 
not of the heroic nature seen in 'Last Human'..

There is one sublime chapter which describes the Cat's first  backwards 
sexual encounter! Read it and weep with laughter!

They  eventually get away from the backwards earth,  some fifteen years 
after  they first intended to make their escape,  and meet up with  Ace 
Rimmer,  a  race of crazed killer androids,  the dismembered remains of 
Holly, and in a climactic reprise of the the 'Gunmen of the Apocalypse' 
episode'  both Kryten and Rimmer come out of it not very well at  all.. 
IE, dead..

Lister  and the Cat jump to another alternative universe,  where Rimmer 
and  Kryen are alive,  and Lister and the Cat died in the 'Better  than 
Life'  headsets where they were left at the end of the first book..  So 
in effect, the story comes back in on itself..

This  book is densely written with the characteristic high  information 
count  per  page that typifies all the books..  It  has a nice line  in 
character  building,  as  all  the major and  middling  characters  are 
described in great detail with their innermost thoughts laid open..

In terms of plot movement, it does not actually go that far, and we are 
left almost back where the story started..  This is the true third book 
in  the series,  as 'Last Human' does not follow the plot as faithfully 
as this one,  and although it is a good book,  it is somewhat different 
from all the others..  'Backwards' redresses the balance..  'Backwards' 
does  not gloss over difficult plot issues unlike 'Last  Human',  which 
tends  to come up with a contrived hasty explanation for what  happened 
on  the Backwards World,  the presence of Christine Kochanski in there, 
Rimmer's whole life story,  and so on.. 'Backwards' does not duck these 
issues,  and is better for it..  For example, Kochanski does not appear 
here,  as  her  and Lister drifted apart as time rolled backwards,  the 
Rimmer  sections are a lot more authentic this time round,  and the Ace 
Rimmer chapters are equally well explained..

The  only  criticism of this book is that it does not have much  of  an 
ending,  (one  of  the strengths of 'Last Human') it is left  open  for 
another book, but there is not really a lot to go on.. I think that Rob 
Grant  could have done a lot better than the 'Lister and Cat escape  to 
an alternative universe and find the alternative Red Dwarf with  Rimmer 
and Kryten - The end.' style of ending we got..

Still, another essential read for the discerning 'Dwarfie!
