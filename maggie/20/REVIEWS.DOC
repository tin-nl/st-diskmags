As usual, we've been taking a look at the newest movies to hit 
the scene.  Well, most of these have been released over the last 
few months or so, save one or two ...

THE NET

In England, the tabloid newspapers are full of the latest scares 
regarding the Internet, with stories such as 'My child can view 
secret files in the Pentagon' regularly littering their pages.
Virtually all of these stories are untrue, of course.

However, The Net is a movie that is based around just what might 
be possible in not so many years.  Starring the lovely actress, 
Sandra Bullock (seen previously in 'Speed' with Keanu Reeves) she 
plays a female computer-scene character.

Talking on a fictitious Internet Relay Chat type system, Sandra 
gets talking to a group of similarly minded people.  One of them 
even tries to ask her out for a meal, but she says she is too 
busy - even though, like her character is based on, she ends up 
by herself ordering a pizza from the local takeaway, with nothing 
but a glowing monitor screen to amuse her.

While she's eating her pizza, someone calls her via the chat 
system, and, after talking for some time via this, she agrees to 
meet up with the guy on the other end of the line.  He has a boat 
- which they both go out on after a pleasant meal followed by a 
walk along the beach.

In Sandra's handbag is a copy of a new program on disk - that she 
has managed to get hold of before anyone else.  While she was 
walking along the beach with her 'friend' someone who the friend 
has paid to carry out such a crime grabbed her handbag from her.

From here, the movie gets Sandra into a dangerous web, where 
even her own personal records on the main system computer at the 
Social Security centre are overwritten with her picture, but 
giving her a completely different name, together with a criminal 
history as long as a piece of string.  She is shocked at this, 
understandably so when she is arrested by the police under this 
new name, even though the original owner of the name has swapped 
their details over.  The authorities, however, do not believe her 
story, so she is put in a cell.

After a while, she manages to contact her doctor, who - in relief 
- manages to confirm that Sandra is who she says she is.  
Following this, once Sandra's character has managed to get a copy 
of a virus program to kill her new details off, a thrilling piece 
of the movie is set within a computer show, where she manages to 
set the virus free, deleting all of the bad details from the 
records.

The film ends with the resulting arrest of the girl who was 
passing herself off as the original name of Sandra's character in 
the movie.

Generally, The Net is a very enjoyable movie, well worth 
watching.  It should be available for hire from your local movie 
store by now.


FLIRTING

This little-known Australian movie became a hit when it was shown 
on Sky TV early last year, and was released on video shortly 
afterwards.  Starring Nicole Kidman (wife of Tom Cruise) and two 
relatively unknown acting stars, the British actress called Thandie
Newton and an Australian actor called Noah Taylor, it was 
well casted.

The story starts off and continues with a point of view from one 
of the students at a male private school.  The student's name is 
Danny Embling (played by Noah) and thoughts constantly float 
around in his head about the girls in the female private school 
which is situated on the other side of the river separating both 
schools.  Both schools regularly meet up for dances and sporting 
activities, and this is where the movie starts.

Danny is one of those unfortunate students at the school to be 
known as the school dork.  Because of this, the other boys at the 
school tease and terrorise him mercilessly, whilst the teachers 
are even more stricter and harsher than them!  The movie opens 
with a regularly repeated scene of Danny and some other boys 
being caned for various misdemeanours.

Over in the girls school, a young coloured girl arrives from 
Africa.  On her arrival she is soon ostracised by the other girls 
- much the same as Danny at the boys school.  However, during a 
debating lesson, Danny and Thandiwe (played by Thandie) get 
together - much to the embarrassment of the teachers!

Things progress from here on, when Danny and Thandiwe embark on 
an affair that shocks both schools when it is finally discovered.
What gets the schools thinking that something is up is when both 
the pupils sneak off to a hotel somewhere - and are found in bed 
together, in one hell of a funny scene.

Overall, the movie is pretty good.  There is some good acting 
here ... and, in general, the movie is very funny in places.  A 
good movie, well worth watching ... you should be able to hire it 
out from your local moviestore.
