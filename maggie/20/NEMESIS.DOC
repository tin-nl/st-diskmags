                    By Titan Designs/Black Scorpion 
                 From the horses mouth, so to speak..

I  spoke to Dave Encill the other day to get some more info about  this 
promising and inexpensive accelerator for the Falcon..

Nemesis  is  now pencilled in for the end of July,  and  was  primarily 
designed  with  the  forthcoming Apex 3 in mind..  According  to  Dave, 
Nemesis  was intended to give the Falcon enough power to drive a 640  x 
480 VGA Truecolour screen mode, the preferred operating environment for 
Apex 3.. 

Nemesis does not stop at boosting the CPU,  and all parts of the system 
benefit from this upgrade.. Indeed it comes in two parts, with a 24 mhz 
mode  for  the CPU and system bus,  and 48 mhz for the DSP and any  FPU 
installed..

The System bus speed enhancement is particularly significant,  as it is 
this  part of the upgrade that allows for the aforementioned 640 x  480 
Truecolour  screen  resolution..  Nemesis compares favourably to  other 
accelerators in this regard, one high profile competitor offering a bus 
speed  of  18  or 20 mhz,which would not be  sufficient  to  drive  the 
required Truecolour mode according to Titan..

The  DSP was the next most important focus of attention as Apex 3 is  a 
heavily DSP based program and will benefit greatly from this  upgrade.. 
(Apex  3 will run without the Nemesis accelerator,  but is really  much 
better with it..)

The  CPU and FPU will benefit as well,  and will be handy for a general 
speed increase on your normal Falcon working environment..

The  Nemesis  will be competitively priced,  especially for  registered 
users of Apex Media who get it for œ39.95..  The rest of us pay a still 
not unreasonable œ49.95.. 

This  is not a totally solderless upgrade,  as there are about a  dozen 
wires  to  solder,  and  one (repairable if things go  horribly  wrong) 
modification  to the Falcon..  A very comprehensive installation manual 
is  supplied  for  the confident..  A professional fitting  service  is 
available for the more fainthearted..  This is still a reasonable price 
and brings the final cost up to œ79.95..

Nemesis is intended to be switchable between accelerated and normal  16 
mhz modes, although the precise method of accomplishing this has yet to 
be decided..  Probably a software based solution,  with the possibility 
of  some kind of automatic detection or enabling of Nemesis to go  into 
future versions of Apex as well..
