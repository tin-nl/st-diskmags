                             Coming soon..

Yet again, you could be forgiven for thinking that nothing new is going
to appear for your favourite computers,  but once again there are still 
lots  of  dedicated or foolhardy people who are  really  interested  in 
producing  new  games,  and  giving me some much needed copy  for  this 
column..

(We'll  have to go back through past Maggies to suss out what  previews 
actually  went any further,  and which ones failed miserably,  could be 
an interesting exercise!)

+From last time!+

Bad  Mood,  the Falcon Doom .WAD player is still moving up through ever 
newer and better versions.. It works satisfactorily on a standard '030, 
but  does  benefit  greatly from an accelerator  card..  We  are  still 
waiting for something that gives us more than just a walk around  .WADs 
though.. Some enemies and something lethal to squish them with would be 
very nice as well..

The  Reservoir Gods Falcon 'Columns' game previously mentioned  is  now 
'Skyfall',  which  was  first released at the Symposium  Convention  in 
April..  The  registered version will have extra twists and tweaks  and 
amusing sound samples all over the place,  and should be available from 
June..
 
Top  Byte  have not released any of their pending games in  their  back 
catalogue  as  yet,  but are now selling a 3-D polygon based  shootemup 
'Kryptonite Data' for the ST..  Having spoken to James recently,  he is 
sort  of  back  on  the case,  and 'Aronath' should  be  with  us  very 
shortly..

Village  Software  have just released 'Biohazard 2',  an overhead  view 
strategy game for all machines..


+For this time!+

Symposium Stuff..
Several  games  previews  were seen,  and indeed released  for  general 
enjoyment at the Symposium in April..

'Running'
You  remember  the Fried Bits last year..  You may also remember a  96k 
Intro  called  'Doomino'  which featured a realistic  Doom  style  game 
engine for the Falcon..  Well after a year of work, this has become the 
soon  to be finished commercial release 'Running'!!  - More details can 
be found in the Symposium party report and in our preview of the  newly 
arrived demo version!

'X-Moon'
A vertically scrolling arcade blaster for Falcon very much in the mould 
of  that old Thalion/Eclipse ST classic 'Wings of Death'..  Very much a 
'scene'  production,  as  several very famous names on the Falcon  demo 
circuit  are  on the credits..  Still a lot more they would like to  do 
before  this  game  is  released..  See more in  our  preview  of  this 
promising game..

'Painium Disaster'
Another vertically scrolling arcade challenge with one man against  the 
alien hordes for your Falcon.. Cruor/Anvilsoft are doing this one..


Stosser Soft Stuff..
Having  released  his new game 'Island Strike',  Tony Greenwood is  now 
working  on a new top secret game project for the ST/STe,  which should 
appear  around the end of September at the forthcoming Atari  Shows  in 
London and Birmingham..  Initial discussions with Tony suggested a huge 
Monkey  Island  style graphical arcade adventure game coming on  up  to 
five  disks,  but later information given in his Maggie interview  (see 
this issue!) now suggests that an ultra-fast Sonic style platform games 
is in the works instead.. Watch this space..


'Free Willy'
Closer  to home,  a demo of a new Falcon game 'WILLY THE ADVENTURER' is
now doing  the  rounds..  It  bears  quite  a lot of resemblance to the
Jaguar game  Rayman,  especially  in how  the main character sprite has
been  put  together..   A  very  simple  preliminary  concept  demo  is 
circulating the online community, and  shows that a relatively advanced
platform game can  work on the Falcon,  and (hopefully) give the Jaguar
a run for its money..

This one is by  Swedish developers  'New Beat developments'..  The full
game is expected to be a commercial release, and should be  ready later
in 1996..

More information can be gleaned from their home page;

Another Doom Clone..
'Bad Mood' and 'Running' are not the final words on this 'who will  get 
to do a Doom clone on Atari' saga.. Indeed, this one is intended for ST 
machines  as well as Falcon,  and is reported by one Beta tester to  be 
better  than Sub Station,  even in these early stages..  We gather that 
this  game  has  a fully texture mapped game engine,  although  how  it 
looks,  or how well it works on an ST, has yet to be determined.. 'Kill 
Things',  to give it its working title, should start to emerge from the 
development shadows fairly shortly.. More info here as we get it..

And  as  if  by the action of mysterious psychic forces,  here  is  some 
additional  textual  info  from  the author Jon  Lewis  of  Digi  Tallis 
Developments, who also wrote the 'Sub Aqua' game for the ST and Falcon..

------

KillThings..

Started out cos I was peed off with  the prospect of having to buy an STe
to play a doom type game (Substation) and I thought I could do better..

Besides, Substation looked like pants.. (no offence to the programmers)
and I thought I could do something with texture mapping in it..

Heck, every other machine has a  texture  mapped wolf clone of some kind,
why not the good ol' ST. Its  about  time somebody showed these PC owners
that you don't need 8 meg of memory,  a pentium and a big hard drive just
to have FUN.. (And the weapons n  death  n stuff just weren't good enough
in everyone elses!)

Current development stage:-

The game world is running. texture mapped  and  z shaded and with a frame
rate that isn't too  bad..   Flat  shaded  floor  and  ceiling, trying to
figure out how to texture map both of  em in as little time as possible..
Glass objects are  in.  ie  stuff  that  you  can  see  thru, for example
walls that have windows  in..  Monsters  are  in  with  the  basics of an
intelligence routine.. this will be expanded!

Bullets are in, ready for the weapon systems and they should be worth the
wait. =]

Nice rotaty map mode, sort  of  like  AvP  but  not  overlaid on the game
world (it'd take too much time!)

Oh, and its not a square substation  type map. it can have curved walls..
=] and at the moment its  a  fullscreen  affair,  but that will get taken
down so I can display a status bar of some kind..

things to do:-

        collision detection with walls, bullets etc..
        texture mapped floor and ceiling
        animating textures
        proper monster intelligence
        finished weapon systems
        bonus packs and such like..
        sound. usually gobbles up processor time.. =[
        some other stuff.. =] (can't say, but you'll like it..)

there ye go.. hope thats enough info for you.. =]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, since I've pestered you guys with pointless news, here's some more!

The bullets are working within  KillThings.  Ie,  you can fire at things,
and the monsters can fire at you if they are in a 'suitable mood'..

And, shock of all shocks..
COLLISION works! well, collision between aliens/bullets against walls..
so you can run upto a wall, keep  the  fire button down and not watch the
bullets go straight thru the wall.. =]

Only snag is. the time  taken  to  check aliens/bullets is exponential to
the number of walls/points that make up the map! Don't panic, the code is
self modifying (sort of) so that it picks the best check method according
to the number of walls versus 3d  points.. Hopefully this should keep the
time taken to check down by a minimum.. =]

I love it. I was running around the small map last night just letting off
many bullets..  and watching them dissapear into the gloom.. =]

All that's needed  now  is  the  player  collision,  alien against bullet
collision etc, and stuff.. =]

Just thought I'd let you know.. =]

gone..
