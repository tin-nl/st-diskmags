                        MAGGIE MUSICAL EXPRESS
                        ----------------------

Welcome aboard the Maggie Musical Express!

This month, casting his  critical  ear  over  the  "tunes" is assembly
coding lover Mr. Pink from  The  Reservoir  Gods!  Let's hope he shows
more taste than when he  choose  that  bloody  in-game tune for Double
Bobble!

********** MAGGIE ALBUM OF THE MONTH **********
( Underworld - Second Toughest In The Infants ) [Junior Boys Own]

If you have heard Underworld's 1993 album "Dubnobasswithmyheadman" you
will have released how trivial  most  of  your record collection is in
comparison. It is an album the defies most of the dance genre by still
sounding completely cutting edge 3  years  after its release. A record
that, it seems, is almost impossible to surpass.

Underworld's second album begins with a  15  minute epic - the immense
juanita/kiteless/to dream of love. This  is  a fantastic track showing
all the Underworld hallmarks of  complex  melodies and surreal lyrics.
"listening to the  barbed  wire  hanging"  is  a  particular favourite
phrase of mine.

Banstyle/Sappys Curry starts slowly  but  gets  a  lot better building
into a breakbeat based  semi-jungle  cut.  This  is  much  touted as a
potential single.

"Confusion The  Waitress"  features  Karl's  stream  of  consciousness
lyrics "she said - once again the superstar".

"Rowla" is more reminiscent of earlier releases  such as Rez, and is a
real steamroller of sound that  storms along like construction workers
on speed.

"Pearls Girl" is a real  peoples  favourite  and also a recent single.
The lyrics  are  again  inspired  namechecking  Al  Green  and leaving
shouting of "crazycrazycrazy" reverberating through the airwaves.

The last two tracks seem a  little  ill  at  ease with the rest of the
album. "Blueski" is a short twanging thing  with a hint of country and
western, whilst "Stagger" is the closes Underworld get to a ballad and
although it does improve with time  is  far from their best track, and
is a long way short of  the  storming  M.E. that closed their previous
album.

This is really amazingly good album,  I can't praise it highly enough.
It should appeal to fans of  all  sorts  of music, whether you like so
called 'dance' music or not, this  record  deserves not to be confined
to any pigeon-hole. The only genre  that  it  is does belong to is the
one labelled "fucking brilliant".

( Model 500 - Deep Space ) [R & S]

Techno music gets a lot  of  criticism  for its supposed fixation with
technology, aliens, spacecraft and the  like,  so perhaps calling your
album "Deep Space" and slapping a  picture  of, erm, Deep Space on the
cover isn't the best way to avoid the stereotype.

But then Model 500 is Juan  Atkins, the seminal Detroit Techno maestro
and he doesn't need to prove anything to anyone.

Opening up the record sleeve  you  see  a starmap with various planets

being marked, and tracks being  attributed  to  these planets. As ever
The Designer's Republic have done a great job on the whole packaging.

The opening cut  "Milky  Way"  was  co-written  by  Kevin "Inner City"
Saunderson, but thankfully steers away  from  the big man's liking for
cheese.

"The Flow" features  vocals  from  Aisha  Jamiel  over  an interesting
rippling background - this is one of my favourite tracks.

"Last Transport (To Alpha Centauri)"  keeps  fading out then returning
just as you thought it  had  ended.  Perhaps Alpha Centauri is further
away than we'd imagined. It would  probably taking more than 5 minutes
and 12 seconds to get there.

"I Wanna Be There (Edit)" will be familiar to all of you who picked up
the Refresh Your Ears R&S cassette on Muzik magazine about a year ago.
It is probably the closest this album gets to a 'pop' track.

My favourite track  is  probably  Starlight  (or  M69  for you budding
Patrick Moore's). Rhythmic, catchy and out there.

Detroit Techno may be surrounded by  a  lot of unfounded hype, but its
main exponents seem to be able to inject 'soul' into their music. This
is not just machine music, it  has  life  - perhaps alien life, but it
has a lot of depth and  complexity.  Jazz is an obvious influence, but
this is no odyssey. At its worst,  it  flows by unnoticed. At its best
it takes you to a  different  planet.  He's  a model and he's sounding
fine.

( LFO - Advance ) [Warp]

They were the pioneers,  one  of  the  groups  that  started the whole
scene. They were  the  ones  who  appeared  on  the  cover smashing up
guitars and proclaiming the death of rock 'n' roll. They were the ones
who had Steve Wright frothing  at  the  mouth.  They  were the ones to
steer a techno tune into the top 10. Then they did a "stone roses" and
buggered off for 5 years.

But now, they  are  back  with  brand  new  long-player.  "Advance" is
totally against the grain of  the  current  techno  scene, you will be
very hard pressed to find a  similar  record.  It doesn't fit into any
convenient pigeon hole  on  genre.  It  sounds  dated, yet futuristic.
Introspective yet uplifting. It is a record full of contradictions.

The record begins with the  stifling,  pounding  of "Advance", a track
that sets the tone for the album.  You  are not quite sure where it is
going, but you tag along for the ride anyway.

"Shut Down" wrong foots you before delivering its excellent crescendo.

As we enter "Loch Ness" we are into calmer, more subtle waters, with a
dash of ambience perhaps, before again building into another monster.

It lights off  and  volume  down  for  the  wistful "goodnight vienna"
before LFO hit  you  full  in  the  face  with  the  single "tied-up",
dripping with repressed sexuality it  should  carry a parental warning
sticker. It is probably the stand out track of this collection.

Elsewhere we get  more  clanking  and  distortion,  and  even  a track
dedicated to the time they spent with Kraftwerk - "Kombat Drinking".

Hats off to LFO again then. When  they recorded the chart breaking LFO
using a œ40 keyboard  and  a  speak  and  spell  machine, Steve Wright

called it "the worse record ever  made". "Advance" will have him again
sprinting back to his Luther Vandross collection.

I would rather stick to the world  of LFO. A world of harshly clanking
industrial sounds. A world  of  claustrophobia  but also serenity. LFO
are back, and boy have we missed them.

( Dreadzone - Second Light ) [Virgin]

Dreadzone are perennial festival favourites,  and  its not hard to see
why with their positive, poppy  take  on  dub and reggae. Their tracks
bombarded John Peel's last festive  50  and  have even managed to make
regular assaults on the charts.

The album begins  with  the  single  "Life,  Love  &  Unity" with Earl
Sixteen (also to be heard  on  Leftfield's "Leftism") espousing family
values.

The viola's come out for "Little  Britain" which is probably too folky
ever to fall into the category of  'cool', but is still a tremendously
enjoyable track.

We also have the pirate-dub  of  "Captain  Dread" which never fails to
bring a smile to the lips and get  the toes tapping all the way to the
end of the gangplank.

Earl Sixteen returns for some  Rastafarian  rumblings on "Zion Youth".
Add to these  a  couple  of  more  mellow  cuts,  a  healthy intake of
marijuana (probably)  and  you  have  "Second  Light".  Its  a  great,
uplifting dub-pop record. The kids are all-light.

( B12 - TIME TOURIST ) [Warp]

B12 are prime exponents of Detroit  techno,  even though they are from
our fair shores  and  they  have  "proper"  jobs  as  bank  clerks and
accountants (hey! rock 'n' roll!) or something.

As well  as  releasing  tracks  under  their  own  record  label,  B12
contributed to  Warp's  seminal  Artificial  Intelligence  series with
their "Electro-Soma" album, and also  recorded  some tracks for the AI
compilation albums. All  the  tracks  on  time  tourist,  however, are
attributed to there other monickers - redcell, musicology and Cmetric.

The sleeve of Time Tourist -  another  Designer's Republic effort - is
worth a mention. It depicts a  futuristic  city with a huge helicopter
style spacecraft flying over bearing  the  logo  "London Tours" with a
London Transport symbol on it.  Spooky.  The  whole  sleeve is set out
like a computer game cover. It  carries marks from computer magazines,
and also instructions on what type of set-up  it has to be run on ( CD
/ Amplifier / Speaker COMPATIBLE. Requires power source).

The  sleeve  notes  namecheck  Autodesk,   Sega,  Sony,  Nintendo  and
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica. Points are deducted for mentioning Bill
Gates, but they do also namecheck 2  unlimited and the vat-man, so one
feels they may be being ironic.

The album itself is the most  complete B12 have created. Warm, flowing
Detroit rhythms. Tracks that  weedle  their  way  into  your brain and
don't let go. Most cuts are mainly at a lower-tempo and best suited to
that dreaded "late-night-listening-slot". I think it is a great record
that holds its own against 'real'  Detroit  techno. To B[12] this good
takes 21B. (Baker street?  Sherlock  Holmes  is  called  for! Where is
Justin Robertson when you need him?). Timeless.
