Okay, everyone a true story of justice in the good old U.S. of A.

Thought  y'all  might enjoy this;  if nothing else,  it shows  internet 
justice, if it can be called that.

My  daughter  & I had just finished a salad at  Neiman-Marcus  Cafe  in 
Dallas  & decided to have a small dessert.  Because our family are such 
cookie lovers,  we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was so 
excellent  that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they  said 
with a small frown,  "I'm afraid not." Well,  I said,  would you let me 
buy the recipe?  With a cute smile,  she said, "Yes." I asked how much, 
and she responded, "Two fifty." I said with approval, just add it to my 
tab.

Thirty days later,  I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and 
it was $285.00.  I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 
for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom 
of the statement, it said, "Cookie Recipe - $250.00." oy, was I upset!! 
I  called Neiman's Accounting Dept.  and told them the waitress said it 
was  "two fifty," and I did not realize she meant $250.00 for a  cookie 
recipe.

I  asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they  said 
they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not 
just  everyone  could duplicate any of our bakery recipes...  the  bill 
would stand.

I  waited,  thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of 
my money back.

I just said,  "Okay, you folks got my $250.00 and now I'm going to have 
$250.00  worth of fun." I told her that I was going to see to  it  that 
every cookie lover will have a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus 
for nothing.  She replied,  "I wish you wouldn't do this." I said, "I'm 
sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even," and I will.

So,  here  it  is,  and  please  pass it to someone else or run  a  few 
copies.... I paid for it; now you can have it for free.
