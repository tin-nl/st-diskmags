
                FALCON VS PC: THE TRUE COSTS COMPARED

             (And you might be surprised at the answer!)

This was an article I had a notion to write for the forthcoming  Maggie 
issue  twenty and has been on my back-burner of unwritten stuff  for  a 
little while now.. Time to get something done now, so here it is..

It  has been a while since I got my Falcon,  nearly three years now  in 
fact!  Such  a  long time ago,  and it does not seem like yesterday, as 
they  say..  My purchase of this particular Atari product is a  complex 
and  drawn-out  tale,  common  to  those folk who try  to  source  such 
hardware after the hey-day of the ST..

It  started with a wish to get hold of one of the one meg  machines  at 
the February 199 16-Bit Fair..  The first public showing of the Falcon, 
and last public appearance of Atari.. A certain deputy editor of Maggie 
pointed me in the direction of the Brixton Exchange Mart (BEM), a world 
famous music hardware store who were getting some of the early machines 
in..  I  must admit I swallowed hard at Atari's last minute bid to  put 
people off by raising the prices by œ100, leaving barely a penny change 
out of six hundred spondoolies,  plonked my deposit on the counter, and 
waited..

And waited some more, for weeks later, they had still not got the goods 
from Atari.. Some other weeks later, and in desperation at Atari's non-
delivery  antics,  the proprieter of BEM suggests a deal on one of  the 
four meg Falcons just delivered that week.. After thinking about it for 
five  minutes,  and deciding that bread and water would be probably  ok 
for a month or two,  I ring him to say yes.. Early April 1993, and nine 
hundred  pounds  lighter,  I  am the proud owner of a brand  new  Atari 
Falcon..

Well  what  has  this got to do with the PC?  Well at the time,  I  was 
looking to upgrade my existing hardware radically, having moved down to 
a  tattered old STFM in anticipation of the Falcon a whole  six  months 
before it was actually ready to appear.. It was inevitable that 'other' 
options would be looked at, especially as there was a lot of talk about 
the  impending 'death' of ST's and the early ascendant of the PC  as  a 
home machine..

I have a clear picture of the PC I spotted at the Tottenham Court  Road 
store  as we ambled down to Brixton to pick up my purchase..  It was  a 
486sx  25mhz PC,  quite a juicy bit of hardware in early '93..  It came 
with  a  105 meg hard disk,  (S)VGA monitor,  and probably four meg  of 
memory..  The price? A princely œ899!! As we considered at the time, it 
was  quite  a  good buy if we were not  already  en-route  to  purchase 
the Falcon..

That  PC represented an opening onto a different path,  a path where my 
hobby/obsession  would have turned out very differently from if  I  had 
stayed  with  the Falcon..  A more enjoyable one?  Possibly,  with much 
greater  access  to  the mainstream,  but I would just be  now  another 
bloated  gamehead,  bored  stiff after six months..  Cheaper?? Now THAT 
does  bear a closer examination..  Which is the purpose of this article 
as you may remember..

We  compared the system startup costs,  and the Falcon loses out a  bit 
here..  On  reflection,  I  think  that  PC did not come  with  a  full 
complement of four meg, and may only have had one or two meg.. However, 
it  did come with a monitor,and a bigger hard drive than  the  Falcon.. 
Megahertz  freaks also compared the 16mhz 68030 unfavourably  with  the 
25mhz  of  the Intel..  But Mhz freaks are notoriously ignorant of  the 
true state of affairs.. Anyway, from a surface examination perspective, 
the  PC,  although  identically  priced to my Falcon,  wins out on  the 
'extras'  such  as  its monitor and extra hard  disk  space..  (If  you 
remember,  the  earliest retail price for the 4mb Falcon with 65mb hard 
drive was just about œ1000!! - Leaving it limping in the PC's wake..)

Now three years is long enough to take a longer perspective on it  all, 
and  I  am simply looking at what extra I have spent on the  Falcon  to 
keep it 'current',  compared with what I would have *had* to have spent 
on a PC to stop it becoming outdated..


The Falcon..
Main  CPU,  nothing  at all,  the software has definitely got better as 
time  has  gone on,  this is all to do with developers getting to  know 
their hardware, and trick it into doing more than seems possible on the 
surface..  Extra hardware such as the Digital Signal Processor provided 
an extra dimension to the machine as well..

Sound Board, sixteen bits all built in, nothing needed here either..

Monitor,  happy  with existing Philips RGB which was mainstay of the ST 
too.. An optional SVGA or multisync monitor would be desirable, but not 
until  I  see  one  for the right price..  No  extra  expenditure  here 
either.. RGB essential for most demos..

Hard  disk..  Probably  the one area where an upgrade comes closest  to 
'necessary'..  Initially  an 80 meg external unit to complement the  65 
meg  internal drive that came with the Falcon for œ100 (including  case 
and leads),  and more lately (Xmas '95) a 400 meg bare mechanism to fit 
snugly inside abovementioned casing cost me œ150..

Memory, still ok on four meg.. Not a bean spent here..

Operating system..  For some reason, this remains free of extra cost or 
the need to upgrade..  Replacement O/S's are available, but I'm not too 
worried yet as most of my favourite kinds of software manage  *without* 
the O/S anyway!!

SCSI CD-ROM,  more of a luxury item,  as this was going cheap from some 
good  friends  of mine at œ120..  Not an everyday requirement for  most 
Atari people but nice to have..

68882  Maths  Co-Processor..  Almost an impulse buy at the Atari  World 
Xmas  '95  show..  I  may  even  get  around  to  doing  some  rendered 
masterpieces with it sometime as well!

So to summarise:-

Falcon - œ900

Hard drive 80 meg with case - œ100

Hard drive 400 meg mechanism - œ150

Double speed CD-ROM - œ120

68882 Maths co-processor - œ20 (good old BeST electronics!)


Total - *œ1290* - (of which œ390 is upgrades) spent in three years..

(This  is  fairly representative of the average Falcon owner,  as  some 
people may opt for an alternative monitor type to the Philips,  but not 
necessarily rush out to buy a CD-ROM and maths co-pro chip..) 

A maximum of œ13-œ1400 can be safely postulated.. This leaves aside the 
fact  that as the fundamentals of the Falcon are unchanged,  a  'basic' 
system  as  found in 1993 would still be perfectly  useable  by  todays 
software.. This is *not* the case for the PC, as we shall now see..


The PC..
Main CPU,  I have no historical PC prices, but instead, I am working on 
the  current equivalents for what is 'state of the art' today..  Taking 
current  Micromart  prices for a 100 MHZ Pentium of œ150-œ200,  we  can 
suggest  that  a 486 DX 66MHZ would be around this level  in  1993-94.. 
Certainly,  this would be a compulsory requirement fairly early on,  as 
the  486  SX  series seemed to devalue very quickly  for  most  new  PC 
software  after a certain point in 93-94..  If this expenditure was not 
enough,  I  would  have been contemplating the whole  ghastly  rat-race 
again  as 486 DX technology is looking decidedly tired against the  new 
generation  of Pentium motherboards,  so another œ200 to be shelled out 
shortly then!

Hard disk, 105 Meg is soon outpaced by the new wave of diskspace hungry 
games, applications, and operating systems coming to the PC.. A 500 meg 
upgrade is soon desirable, for anything from œ200.. As we get into even 
more  elephantine  software  lately,  something over a gigabyte  for  a 
similar  outlay may be desirable.  At least hard disk prices are coming 
down!! 

Memory,  eight  megabytes  is  adequate against  today's  PC  software, 
another œ100 or so.. Windows '95 likes sixteen meg better..

Operating system,  Windows 3.1 bundled with original PC,  but nervously 
contemplating purchase of Windows '95 for another œ80.. Did I also hear 
something about newer versions of DOS too?
 
Sound  card,  this would probably be an extra item at point of purchase 
in  1993..  Back then the 'multimedia' idea of a fully equipped PC  had 
not  been thought of,  most PC's were sold as business machines without 
the 'extras' that made them into useful games hardware..  Anything from 
œ30  for  a basic soundblaster,  to œ200 for a top of the range  Gravis 
Ultrasound..

CD-ROM..  As  the  idea  of  'Multimedia' caught  on,  and  most  games 
publishers released first onto CD-ROM,  or on CD-ROM only, this becomes 
very necessary.. IDE drives are quite cheap now, but expect to pay, say 
another œ100-odd back then?

Video  card..  Back  in 1993,  256 colour VGA was available, but let us 
suppose  that  one  of the other upgrades  clashed  with  the  original 
graphics card so it needed replacing,  an upgraded video card will have 
more video RAM,  say 1 meg or more,  as opposed to the measly 256k that 
came originally..  That could be anything from œ50-œ300 depending on if 
you  want things like hardware MPEG capability and 16  million  colours 
there..

From 1994,  the VESA local bus standard caught on,  which may well have 
forced  a wholesale chucking out of 'old' components that did not  work 
with it, such as those found in our hypothetical PC that was on sale in 
Tottenham Court Road in 1993 perhaps?

By  this time,  you might as well invest in a new case as the whole  of 
the PC's innards are a completely different machine!!


To summarise in something less than the text of the Windows manual:-

PC 486 SX 25MHZ - œ900

Motherboard to 66MHZ - œ150   (To Pentium 100 - œ150?)

Hard disk to 500 meg - say œ200

Extra memory to run 'Doom' properly - 8 meg - œ100

Sound card averaged out - say œ50

CD-ROM - œ100ish (possible further upgrade to quad speed needed!)

Video card (semi-decent but not silly money) - œ100 

Total  (without Pentium)  - *œ1600* of which œ700 is upgrades spent  on 
over three years

This does *not* take into account the current generational cycle of  PC 
upgrades..  The  above expenditure merely gets you a 486 DX 66 PC  with 
reasonable memory, hard drive space and sound and graphics cards.. This 
setup looking a little tired by now and unable to run current  software 
with  much  panache..  To  get it up to date,  then probably  *another* 
several  hundred pounds to get a Pentium,  quad or faster speed CD-ROM, 
sixteen  bit  soundcard,  bigger hard drive,  extra memory,  Windows '95 
etc, would be needed..

And here's the stinger..

ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUDE 17.5% VAT!!

To conclude..

Falcon - œ13-œ1400 inc VAT over three years..

PC  -  œ1880 inc VAT to get an 'obsolete' and worthless box by  current 
ever-changing standards..  The real costs cannot be calculated, as they 
are ongoing with no end in sight.. Could be œ2500 or more by now??

Which  still  leaves the final question:  Why do PC owners put up  with 
all this crap?!

I think I made the *right* decision going for the Falcon after all!!

Supplementary info:-

Since  this  article was originally written back in  February,  it  now 
turns  out  that even some of the lesser forms of Pentium  are  now  on 
their  way  out,  with the PC press stating that 100 mhz is really  the 
minimum that you need to get by with on that sad platform these days..

PC owners, time to get your wallet out again!
