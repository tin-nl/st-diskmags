This little CD ROM was picked up at the Atari World show last year  for 
a very reasonable tenner..  This CD is produced by Team Computers,  the 
originators  of the advanced NeoN rendering and 3-D animation  creation 
package..  Now  thanks to Tat,  we should have a full review of NeoN in 
this issue of Maggie (cheers mate!) but for now,  this little taster is 
freely available..

The blurb on the box goes 'This CD brings you animations that make your 
3D imaginations come true!'

It  is more like,  this CD brings you loads of .FLI and .AVI files that 
make your brain explode with their huge size..  Indeed, the majority of 
the  disk consists of these animations,  many of which are up to  30-40 
megabytes in length,  with a typical 'short' film coming in at say, 10-
15 meg..

The .AVI animations are best suited to PCs, until I can try out the new 
generation  of .AVI players for the Falcon,  as the one I have got is a 
dirt  slow  one  frame  per second  thing..  The  .FLI  animations  are 
eminently  accessible  however,  and a version of the Apex  Media  .FLI 
viewer is supplied on disk to make it so..    

About  250 meg for each category,  with the rest of the disk being made 
up of assorted Falcon and PC utilities,  including the Apex media demo, 
and  a working NeoN demo (which needs the maths co-pro chip to work,  a 
sure way to make sure that a friend's installation of such a device  in 
your Falcon actually worked!) The PC version of this program needs O/S2 
Warp to work, a deliberate stab at Windows perhaps??

Also on the disk,  a TT version of the NeoN demo, for all you TT owners 
with  a CD-ROM,  several piccy files (mainly .BMP) and some .WAV  files 
for the .AVI-less Falcon owners out there..

Once  you've played with the animations and fiddled with the  programs, 
not a lot more to do,  but the disk is only a tenner,  and represents a 
good  way  to  get your hands on a load of  huge  animation  files,  as 
opposed to the tiddly ten second things you normally get on a  standard 
Atari collection CD..  The animations show off some of the potential of 
NeoN if you are up to investing in a package of that complexity..

Several  of  these  animations were actually shown on  the  big  screen 
'live'  at  the  Symposium  as  part  of  the  rolling   entertainments 
programme..  Also  there  was one entry for the graphics section  which 
looked  rather more than the usual 'bizarre collection of  3-D  objects 
with  peculiar  lighting' type pictures that are  common  to  rendering 
packages..

Ratings..

Content:-  80%  -  Mainly animations,  with some very  large  files  on 
there..  The  only  way to transport these being on  CD-ROM..  Smallish 
collections of related utilities for both Falcon and PC on disk..

Ease  of  Access:- 75% - Pretty easy to get to all areas of  the  disk, 
obviously PC related files a no-no,  and no easy way as yet to run .AVI 
animations..  (We tried this on a friends PC, and using the fancy O/S 2 
based shell program the animations struggled to keep up even on there.. 
It  was only with the PC trimmed down for speed and using  the  Windows 
media  player,  were  we able to get the sound track to sync  with  the 
animation..  

Overall:- 81% - Recommended if animations are your bag,  otherwise, not 
a lot else in there..
