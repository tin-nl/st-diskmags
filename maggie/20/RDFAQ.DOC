Subject: What is RED DWARF?

  RED DWARF is a British science fiction comedy series that has been on
  the air in the U.K. since 1988.  It is the brainchild of "Grant
  Naylor", a creative team consisting of Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, who
  write and produce the show.  The premise of the show is best summed up
  by the opening narration used in the first series:

  "This is an S.O.S. distress call from the mining ship Red Dwarf.  The
  crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak.  The only survivors are
  Dave Lister, who was in suspended animation during the disaster, and
  his pregnant cat, who was safely sealed in the hold.  Revived three
  million years later, Lister's only companions are a life-form who
  evolved from his cat, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation of one
  of the dead crew." --- Holly, the ship's computer

  The regular cast of the series is:

  Dave Lister...............................Craig Charles
  Arnold Rimmer..............................Chris Barrie
  Holly.....................................Norman Lovett (series 1-2)
                                          Hattie Hayridge (series 3-5)
  The Cat................................Danny John-Jules
  Kryten.................................Robert Llewellyn

  RED DWARF is also a series of novels based on the TV show.  The novels
  greatly expand on, and are greatly different from, the show.  Many of
  the same ideas appear in the novels, but these ideas are put together
  in new and interesting ways.  Three novels have been published so far:

  RED DWARF: INFINITY WELCOMES CAREFUL DRIVERS
  by Grant Naylor
  ISBN 0-14-012437-3
  Penguin, 1989

  RED DWARF: BETTER THAN LIFE
  by Grant Naylor
  ISBN 0-14-012438-1
  Penguin, 1990

  RED DWARF: THE LAST HUMAN
  by Doug Naylor
  ISBN 0-67-085255-4
  Viking, 1995

  To everyone's surprise, THE LAST HUMAN was written by Doug Naylor
  only.  The paperback edition will be published in October 1995.  Rob
  Grant has expressed interest in writing a book based on RED DWARF, but
  it's not known whether he will do so.

  The first two novels have also been published in one volume:

  RED DWARF OMNIBUS
  by Grant Naylor
  ISBN 0-14-017466-4
  Penguin, 1991

  This combined rerelease also contains the script for "Dave Hollins,
  Space Cadet" (one of the SON OF CLICHE sketches that started it all --
  see "Did RED DWARF start on radio?"), a reproduction of the beer mat
  on which the idea for Red Dwarf was allegedly first written, and the
  original script for "The End" (the first episode of the series).

------------------------------

Subject: Where can I see RED DWARF in the United States?

  RED DWARF is seen on public television stations across the country. If
  your local PBS station doesn't show it, write to them, and convince
  your friends to write to them, until they do!  All six series are
  available for purchase by PBS member stations.

  If you don't know when (or if) your local PBS station shows RED DWARF,
  check your local listings or call the station and ask.  Please don't
  post the question to alt.tv.red-dwarf; that will send it all over
  the planet, annoying people who don't know or care about your local
  station's programming.  Besides, the other methods are faster.

------------------------------

Subject: Where can I get videotapes of RED DWARF?

  Videotapes of Series 1 through 6 are available at video stores in the
  throughout the British Commonwealth and in the U.S.

  In Australia, all episodes are available from ABC stores (along with
  books, T-shirts, and other RD merchandise).

  In the Netherlands, you can get them from W.H. Smith stores.

------------------------------

Subject: Did RED DWARF start on radio?

  Not exactly.  Rob Grant and Doug Naylor wrote the short-lived radio
  series SON OF CLICHE (broadcast for two six-episode seasons on BBC
  Radio 4 in 1984).  In an ongoing series of sketches, a space cadet
  named Dave Hollins was trapped alone on a spaceship with a slightly
  senile computer called HAB.  (The voice of HAB was provided by Chris
  Barrie, the actor who plays Rimmer in RED DWARF.)  Many of the ideas
  and jokes from these sketches were later incorporated into RED DWARF,
  but there is no direct connection.
        
  The script for one of the "Dave Hollins, Space Cadet" sketches is
  included in the RED DWARF OMNIBUS (see "What is RED DWARF?").

------------------------------

Subject: Is there an American version of RED DWARF?

  No, not really.  The NBC network expressed interest in an American
  version of the show and two pilots were made by Universal, but no
  series was ever produced.

  The first pilot was written by Linwood Boomer and filmed on 22 January
  1992 at Universal City Studios in Los Angeles.  The cast included the
  following actors:

  Dave Lister.................................Craig Bierko
  Arnold Rimmer.............................Chris Eigelman
  Holly........................................Jane Leeves
  Kryten..................................Robert Llewellyn
  The Cat....................................Hinton Battle
  Christine Kochanski...................Elizabeth Morehead
  First Officer Munson...................Michael Heintzman
  Captain Tau...........................Lorraine Toussaint

  Grant Naylor served as technical consultants.  Robert Llewellyn (from
  the BBC cast) reprised his role as Kryten.  (Some fans may also
  recognize Jane Leeves from the American comedies MURPHY BROWN and
| FRAZIER.  LAW AND ORDER fans may remember Lorraine Toussaint as public
| defender Shambala Greene.)  The plot was a retelling of "The End",
  with some elements of "Future Echoes" thrown in for good measure. Some
  surprising and odd changes were made: for example, Lister was
  transformed into a clean-cut and well-dressed Caucasian, and the H on
  Rimmer's forehead was replaced with a silver marble.

  After rejecting this version, NBC commissioned a second pilot with the
  following cast:

  Lister......................................Craig Bierko
  Rimmer....................................Anthony Fuscle
  Holly........................................Jane Leeves
  Kryten..................................Robert Llewellyn
  Cat........................................Terry Farrell

  The second pilot was not a complete episode, but rather a promo that
  combined scenes from the first pilot and newly filmed segments
  spotlighting the new cast members.  This pilot fixed some problems
  (such as restoring Rimmer's H), but had more odd changes, such as
  casting a woman as the Cat.  (Terry Farrell went on to play Jadzia Dax
  on STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE.)  The second pilot was also rejected,
  and the proposed series was shelved indefinitely.

  [Does anyone know who wrote the second pilot, or when and where it was
  filmed? -- PMB]

  Neither pilot has ever been aired or released on videocassette, but
  bootleg copies of the first pilot can be found at science fiction
  conventions.  (The second pilot does not seem to have fallen into the
  hands of bootleggers.)

  A redesigned Kryten suit (of somewhat better quality than the old BBC
| version) was made for the U.S. pilots by Joseph Kerezman and Mike
| Moore of JK Costuming.  When the pilots were rejected, the BBC created
| a new Kryten suit (based on the U.S. one) for Series Six.

------------------------------

Subject: Who is Grant Naylor?

  The "About the Author" note in the RED DWARF novels (see "What is RED
  DWARF?") has this to say about the creator(s) of the series:

  "Grant Naylor is a gestalt entity occupying two bodies, one of which
  lives in north London, the other in south London.  The product of a
  horribly botched genetic-engineering experiment, which took place in
  Manchester in the late fifties, they try to eke out two existences
  with only one mind.  They attended the same school and the same
  university, but, for tax reasons, have completely different wives.

  The first body is called Rob Grant, the second Doug Naylor. Among
  other things, they spent three years in the mid-eighties as head
  writers of SPITTING IMAGE; wrote Radio Four's award-winning series
  SON OF CLICHE; penned the lyrics to a number one single; and created
  and wrote RED DWARF for BBC television.

  They have made a living variously by being ice-cream salesmen,
  shoe-shop assistants and by attempting to sell dodgy life-assurance
  policies to close friends.  They also spent almost two years on the
  night shift loading paper into computer printers at a mail-order
  factory in Ardwick.  They can still taste the cheese 'n' onion
  toasties.

  Their favourite colour is orange."

  Grant Naylor's number one single was "The Chicken Song," a SPITTING
  IMAGE spinoff.  Philip Pope composed the music and produced the
  record, which was released in 1986 by Virgin Records.

------------------------------

Subject: Where can I write to the cast and crew of the show?

  The Official RED DWARF Fan Club (UK) (see "Are there RED DWARF fan
  clubs?") will forward mail to the cast and crew.  They do not open the
  mail if a covering letter explains what it is and asks for it to be
  forwarded.

------------------------------

Subject: What does "smeg" mean?

  The characters in the show use it as an all-purpose profanity.
  Apparently derived from "smegma," the term for a particularly
  unpleasant bodily secretion, the slang term "smeg" was reportedly in
  use in England before the show premiered, although not commonly.
  Grant Naylor presumably adopted this little-known bit of Scouse
  profanity as a blanket replacement for all other swearing, to keep
  them out of trouble with the BBC and to poke fun at the long-standing
  convention in science-fiction of inventing futuristic slang.

------------------------------

Subject: What are the lyrics to the theme song?

  It's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere
  I'm all alone, more or less
  Let me fly far away from here
  Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun

  I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose
  Drinking fresh mango juice
  Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes
  Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun
  Fun, fun, fun in the sun, sun, sun

  There has been much debate over the "goldfish" line -- it is not sung
  very clearly, and some fans think it is simply "Goldfish *are*
  nibbling."  However, in the "Smeg-Ups" tape (see "Where can I get
  videotapes of RED DWARF?"), Robert Llewellyn recites the theme song
  lyrics, and they are as listed above.  (A "shoal" is a school of
  fish.)

  The theme song was composed by Howard Goodall and sung by Jenna
  Russell.

------------------------------

Subject: What does "LEVEL NIVELO" mean?

  Red Dwarf is a bilingual ship, with English and Esperanto as the two
  official languages.  "Nivelo" is the Esperanto word for "level".  The
  signs in the corridors of the ship simply indicate (in both languages)
  what level you're on.

  Esperanto is a real language, developed in the the 1880s by Polish
  ophthalmologist L.L. Zamenhof.  The episode "Kryten" establishes that
  Lister, Holly, and Kryten all speak at least some Esperanto.  Rimmer
  is shown trying -- and failing -- to learn Esperanto from a videotape.

  The name "Esperanto" means "one who hopes," a fact that is alluded to
  in "Back to Reality."

------------------------------

Subject: What are some of the foods mentioned on the show?

  "Vindaloo," the most frequently mentioned food item on the show, is a
  very, very hot Indian curry dish.  Most Indian restaurants have them
  on the menu.  They can contain almost any variety of meat, thus
  Lister's references to "mutton vindaloo," "chicken vindaloo," etc.

  "Madras sauce" is another standard curry sauce, less hot than
  vindaloo.

  "Poppadoms," another Indian food item, are thin lentil-flour wafers
  resembling tortillas, deep-fried until crisp.
       
  A "shami kebab" is an appetizer served in Indian restaurants.  It
  consists of finely ground meat and lots of spices, grilled over a
  flame.  The meat is a mixture of pork and either goat (in more
  authentic restaurants) or beef (in less authentic ones).  You
  typically get two shami kebabs with a salad side dish.  Shami kebabs
  are sometimes prepared and served in an egg coating, similar to an
  omelette.

  "Chutney" is a fruit piccalilli (pickled relish), often eaten with
  cold meat.

  "Gazpacho soup" is a Spanish tomato-and-cucumber cold soup which often
  includes garlic, olive oil, and bread.  It's common in Spain and in
  upscale American restaurants.

  A "pot noodle" is an instant noodle product marketed in the U.K. by
  Golden Wonder, a snack food company.  It's a plastic container with
  pre-cooked dried noodles and flavorings inside.  To prepare it, you
  open the container, pour in boiling water, wait a few moments, and eat
  it.

  A "kipper" is a herring, cured by splitting, salting, and smoking.
  Kippers are eaten as a breakfast food in some parts of the U.K.

  A "Topic Bar" is a candy bar sold in the U.K., consisting of fondant
  and hazelnuts covered with chocolate.  (This is what Lister means in
  "Marooned" when he says "Don't mention Topics, they're food.")  One ad
  campaign for the Topic Bar used the slogan "A hazelnut in every bite."
  Thus, in "Stasis Leak", Rimmer complains, "Everything always goes
  wrong for me.  I'm probably the only person in the world to buy a
  Topic Bar without a single hazelnut in it."

  "Taramasalata" is a Greek appetizer consisting of a light paste of fish
  roe, olive oil, lemon juice, and moistened bread crumbs or mashed
  potatoes.

| "Bhindi bhaji" is a vegetable dish made with okra.

  "Tarka dhall" is a mild curry dish based on lentils.

------------------------------

Subject: Why is Holly now a woman?  How did Kryten change?

  The original actor to play Holly, Norman Lovett, left the series after
  a dispute over his salary.  In an interview with RED DWARF SMEGAZINE
  (issue 9, November 1992), Lovett said that he asked to be paid the
  same as the other actors on the series, but his request was turned
  down.  Hattie Hayridge had appeared in "Parallel Universe" as Hilly,
  Holly's female counterpart.  "When Norman said he wasn't doing another
  series, I auditioned," she recalls.  The character of Holly kept the
  same name and personality despite the recasting.

  Kryten's original actor, David Ross, wasn't available to commit to a
  series when Grant Naylor decided to make Kryten a continuing
  character, so he was replaced by Robert Llewellyn.  (Ross later
  returned in "White Hole" as the new voice of Talkie Toaster.)  There
  were also several changes in the show's look between Series Two and
  Three, including changes in costumes, sets, and miniatures,
  particularly the addition of the Starbug and its hangar bay.

  Most of these changes are more or less explained by the following
  words that scroll rapidly up the screen at the beginning of
  "Backwards":

  "Three million years in the future, Dave Lister, the last human being
  alive, discovers he is pregnant after a liaison with his female self
  in a parallel universe.  His pregnancy concludes with the successful
  delivery of twin boys, Jim and Bexley.  However, because the boys were
  conceived in another universe, with different physical laws, they
  suffer from highly accelerated growth rates and are both eighteen
  years old within three days of being born.  In order to save their
  lives, Lister returns them to the universe of their origin, where they
  are reunited with their father (a woman), and are able to lead
  comparatively normal lives.  Well, as normal as you can be if you've
  been born in a parallel universe and your father's a woman and your
  mother's a man and you're eighteen years old three days after your
  birth.  Shortly afterward, Kryten, the service mechanoid, who had left
  the ship after being rescued from his own crashed vessel, the Nova 5,
  is found in pieces after his space bike crashed into an asteroid.
  Lister rebuilds the 'noid, but is unable to recapture his former
  personality.  Meanwhile, Holly, the increasingly erratic computer,
  performs a head sex change operation on himself.  He bases his new
  face on Hilly, a female computer with whom he'd once fallen madly in
  love."
        
  It *is* possible to read all this, using a VCR with good freeze-frame
  capabilities.  Try it.

------------------------------

Subject: What happened to the Red Dwarf and Holly?

  Throughout Series Six, the characters travel aboard Starbug; the Red
  Dwarf (and Holly) don't appear at all.  This tends to confuse viewers
  who missed the explanation in "Psirens".

  Briefly, what happened is this: Lister parked the Red Dwarf in orbit
  around a planetoid, and then forgot which planetoid it was.  "They're
  all the same, those little blue-green planetoids.  Blue-green and
  planetoidy."  Subsequently, Red Dwarf was stolen "by persons or
  lifeforms unknown."  Starbug followed the ship's vapor trail for over
  200 years, with Lister and the Cat in deep sleep and Rimmer switched
  off to conserve power.  At the first opportunity to actually catch up
  with Red Dwarf, Kryten revived the others, and the saga continued . . .

  The real reason for the change was to eliminate Holly from the show.
  According to Hattie Hayridge, the parts for Holly and the Cat had both
  been getting smaller and smaller.  Grant Naylor decided to drop one of
  the characters and expand the other.  It was easier to drop Holly
  because many of her lines could be given to Kryten instead.

  At a convention in January 1996, Doug Naylor anounced that *both*
  Lovett and Hayridge will be signed for Series Seven.

Subject: What's the "lost" ending to "Out of Time"?

  The "Red Dwarf Smeg-Ups" videotape includes an ending for "Out of
  Time" that was filmed, but never used.  LizBeth258@aol.com describes
  the ending as follows:

  "Rimmer blows up the time drive.  Seconds later, a laser cannon blast
  blows up one of the Starbugs, while a second one is seen flying in the
  upper right-hand corner of the screen.

  In the next scene, Kryten is carrying a pitcher of yellow liquid into
  Starbug's hold while Rimmer, Lister and Cat are seated around the
  table with wine glasses in front of them.  Kryten explains that they
  were never killed because Rimmer's actions in blowing up the time
  drive caused their future selves to cease to exist and notes that
  Rimmer had in fact saved the day.  Rimmer grins broadly and tells
  Kryten that it was nothing and not to mention it while Lister claps
  him on the shoulder.  Kryten then pours the 'homemade magaritas' into
  all four glasses and passes on better news: they are now a mere six
  hours behind Red Dwarf and that there is no doubt in his mind that
  they'll be able to catch up.

  Kryten proposes a toast 'to the present' and all four click glasses
  and take a drink.  Lister, wearing a foam mustache, makes a horrible
  face and exclaims that they aren't drinking magaritas, they're
  drinking 'urine recyc' and glares at Kryten.  Rimmer and Cat, with
  their matching foam mustaches, also making nasty faces, give Kryten a
  dirty look.  Kryten, with his foaming mustache, slouches with
  embarrassment in his chair."

Subject: Will there be a Series Seven?

| Yes!  In March 1996, Robert Llewellyn reported that "We are going into
| production on May 20, for 14 weeks."  On 25 March, a voice-over
| announcement on BBC2 stated that the next series will be aired "early
| in the New Year."
|
| However, Chris Barrie will not be in all of the new episodes.
| Throughout 1995, articles in various U.K. newspapers reported that
| Barrie was "in dispute with the show" or that he was quitting.
| In February 1996, the DAILY EXPRESS reported that Barrie would
| appear in just two episodes of the new BBC2 series.  However,
| Llewellyn stated in March that "he is in at least 4 episodes,
| possibly more."
|
| Series Seven will bring some other changes, according to Llewellyn:
| "I am writing one episode, it's called 'Beyond a Joke' at the moment,
| but more than that I am not at liberty to divulge.  The rest of the
| cast remains the same, although there will be one new character, ha
| ha.  And guess what.  I am under strict instructions not to say
| anything about him/her. . . . I have a new mask and a new costume.
| Same basic design, hopefully more comfortable."

Subject: Was Craig Charles arrested for rape?

  Yes, but he was cleared of all charges.

  On 8 July 1994, Esther Harman (a former stripper and Charles's
  ex-girlfriend) filed a charge of rape against him.  Charles was
  arrested, imprisoned, and denied bail.  On 25 October, after being
  attacked (but not wounded) by a fellow inmate wielding a homemade
  knife, Charles was released on bail.

  The trial began on 20 February 1995 and lasted for two weeks.  No
  forensic evidence was shown to exist proving that a rape had occurred.
  In his instructions to the jury, the judge stated that a woman's claim
  to have been raped doesn't prove that she actually was.  The jury took
  less than ninety minutes to find Charles not guilty.  Afterwards,
  Charles made an emotional appeal to the press for the anonymity of
  those accused of rape.

------------------------------

Subject: What's the title of the last episode of Series Two?

  "Parallel Universe," according to the RADIO TIMES and the label of the
  BBC videotape release.  No title in given the episode, which begins
  with a musical number instead of the usual titles sequence.

------------------------------

Subject: What are the lyrics to "Tongue Tied"?

  "Parallel Universe" begins with a musical number that turns out to be
  a dream had by the self-centered Cat.  The studio audience's laughter
  makes the lyrics a little hard to understand, but combining a couple
  of different posters' ideas of what they were gave us this:

  The Cat:                                      Chorus -- Lister and Rimmer:

  When I saw you for the first time             (first time)
  My knees began to quiver                      (quiver)
  And I got a funny feeling                     (feeling)
  In my kidneys and my liver                    (digestive system baby)

  My hands they started shakin'                 (shakin')
  My heart began a-thumpin'                     (boom boom boom)
  My breakfast left my body                     (huey huey huey)
  It all really tells me something

  Girl you make me tongue tied                  (tongue tied)
  Tongue tied, whenever you are near me         (near me)
  Tied tongue                                   (tied tongue)
  Tied tongue                                   (tied tongue)
  Whenever you're in town

  I saw you 'cross the dance floor              (dancin')
  I thought of birds and bees                   (reproductive system baby)
  And when I tried to speak to ya               (talk talk)
  My tongue unraveled to my knees               (flippety-flippety-flop)

  I tried to say I love you                     (love you)
  But it came out kind of wrong, girl           (wrong girl)
  It sounded like "Nunubididoo"                 (tongue tied)
  Nuh mur nuh murh ni nong nurl

  'Cause you make me tongue tied                (tongue tied)
  Tongue tied, whenever you are near me         (near me)
  Be-dobby-durgle                               (dobby-durgle)
  Tongue tied                                   (tongue tied)
  Whenever you're around

  Oh I'm beggin' on my knees
  Sweet, sweet darling, listen please
  Understand me when I say
  Bedurble-diggle-doggle-dooby-doggle-durgle-day

  I'm trying to say nungy-nangy                 (nangy-nungy)
  Ningy-nongy, why can't I tell you clearly     (clearly)
  Be-dobby-durgle                               (dobby-durgle)
  Durgle-dobby                                  (durgle-dobby)
  Whenever you're around                        (around)
  Whenever you're around                        (around)

  In the fall of 1993, "Tongue Tied" was released as a single in England
  and rose to #17 in the Gallup UK Top 40.  The artist was listed simply
  as "The Cat."  A music video of "Tongue Tied" was reportedly shown on
  the TOP OF THE POPS show in England and on MTV in the States. Copies
  of the video (and a half-hour program on the making of the video) are
  available from John McElroy (see "Where can I get other RED DWARF
  merchandise?").

------------------------------

Subject: What are they really saying in "Backwards"?

  Most of the reversed dialogue in the episode "Backwards" is pretty
  much either what the subtitles say it is or what you'd expect from
  context; some of it actually appears to be random noise.  There are
  two notable exceptions, however.
        
  When Lister and the Cat steal a bicycle, its owner yells after them,
  "You scoundrels!  Return my bike immediately!" -- at least, according
  to the subtitles.  What he actually says, however, is, "Oi!  Hey!  Oi,
  you robbing bastards, that's our tandem!"

  Later, when the stage manager comes in to yell at Rimmer and Kryten,
  he appears to be blaming them for starting the "fight." Here's what
  he's actually saying:

  "Frankly, your act's crap.  Anyway, anybody could have done it.  I
  hate the lot of you.  Bollocks to you! . . . You are a stupid,
  square-headed, bald git, aren't you?  I ain't pointing at you, I'm
  pointing at you.  But I'm not actually addressing you, I'm addressing
  the one prat in the country who's bothered to get hold of this
  recording, turn it round, and actually work out the rubbish that I'm
  saying.  What a poor, sad life he's got!"

------------------------------

Subject: Who is Gordon Bennett?

  "Gordon Bennett" is a name used by the characters, most notably Holly,
  as an expletive ("Gordon Bennett!  What was that?").  James Gordon
  Bennett (1841-1918) was an American newspaper tycoon and multi-
  millionaire who is listed in the GUINESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS for
  "Greatest Engagement Faux Pas."  Bennett's engagement to Caroline May
  was broken in 1877 after he arrived late and drunk at the May family's
  New York mansion and urinated in the living room fireplace in front of
  his hosts.  Today, Bennett's name is used as an expression of
  disbelief in England, and is essentially a euphemism for "God".

------------------------------

Subject: How many times has Rimmer has sex?

  Only once while he was alive, with Yvonne McGruder, the ship's female
  boxing champion ("Thanks for the Memory").  The story he tells Lister
  in "Marooned", about losing his virginity in the back seat of his
  brother's car, appears to be false.  Rimmer has had simulated sex in a
  virtual reality game ("Better Than Life") and holographic sex with
  another hologram ("Holoship").

------------------------------

Subject: How many people were in Red Dwarf's crew?

  In "The End", Todhunter says "There are 169 people on board this
  ship."  Yet in "Justice", the Justice Computer charges Rimmer with
  1,167 counts of murder for causing the deaths of the entire crew.
  What gives?

  RED DWARF is full of minor inconsistencies like this one. When Grant
  Naylor come up with a good idea (such as the "light bee" -- see "How
  can Rimmer leave the ship?"), they don't worry overmuch about whether
  it contradicts something in a previous episode.  In this case, they
  evidently decided that a larger crew was more appropriate for a ship
  five miles long and three miles in diameter.

  One possible explanation is that the Justice Computer got its
  information from Rimmer's mind, and Rimmer has an inflated notion of
  his own importance.  In addition to overstating his own responsibility
  for the deaths of the crew, he may have exaggerated the number of
  people involved.

------------------------------

Subject: How can Rimmer leave the ship?

  Because Rimmer is a computer-generated hologram, some viewers are
  confused when he leaves Red Dwarf and visits planets, space stations,
  other ships, and so forth.  In early episodes, Rimmer was generated by
  the Red Dwarf's onboard holographic equipment, which allowed him to
  move freely about the ship.  He was also able to travel on the Red
  Dwarf's auxilary vessels (Blue Midget and White Giant), which
  presumably carry their own hologram generators.  He could only visit
  the surface of a planet within a Hologram Projection Cage, as seen in
  "Thanks for the Memory".

  This limitation proved to be inconvenient, so Grant Naylor came up
  with another explanation, the "light bee".  This device is a tapered
  cylinder about one inch in diameter and three inches long that "buzzes
  around inside him and projects his image" (as described by Holly in
  "Meltdown").  The light bee can go anywhere, allowing Rimmer to leave
  the ship without needing a projection cage.

  Some fans have speculated that the light bee was invented sometime
  during Series 2 (by Holly) or Series 3 (by either Holly or Kryten).
  However, this doesn't explain how Rimmer was able to leave the Blue
  Midget and enter the wreck of the Nova 5 in "Kryten", two episodes
  *before* he was shown in a projection cage.

------------------------------

Subject: How did the Polymorph touch Rimmer?

  In the episode "Polymorph", a shape-changing creature that feeds on
  emotions invades the Red Dwarf.  This creature uses its shapeshifting
  ability to provoke an emotional response, then attaches a sucker to
  the victim's forehead and sucks out the emotion.  Lister, the Cat,
  Kryten, and Rimmer all succumb to the creature's attack.

  Some fans have asked how the Polymorph could possibly attach its
  sucker to Rimmer (who is, after all, a hologram).  Two possible
  explanations have been suggested: either the sucker actually made
  contact with Rimmer's light bee (see "How can Rimmer leave the
  ship?"), or the Polymorph can change into a hologram.  Holograms can
  touch each other, as demonstrated in "Parallel Universe."

------------------------------

Subject: How many times has Starbug crashed?

  There are at least two vehicles called "Starbug" on board the Red
  Dwarf, and they seem to crash-land or collide with things an awful
  lot.  Crash landings occur in the following episodes:

  "Backwards"                     "Terrorform"
  "Marooned"                      "Psirens"
  "Bodyswap"                      "Gunmen of the Apocalypse"
  "Dimension Jump"                "Emohawk: Polymorph II"

  The crashed Starbug was abandoned on more than one occasion,
  indicating either that more than two of them exist, or that facilities
  exist on board Red Dwarf to manufacture replacement Starbugs.

------------------------------

Subject: Didn't Lister have his appendix out twice?

  In "Thanks for the Memory", we learn that Lister had his appendix
  removed years ago.  In "Legion", it gets removed again.  How is this
  possible?

  Some fans have theorized that Lister's appendix was regenerated in
  "DNA", along with the rest of his body.  In reality, this was a
  continuity error.  The error is briefly referred to and (sort of)
  cleared up in the latest novel RED DWARF: THE LAST HUMAN (see "What is
  RED DWARF?").  It is also mentioned in the questions section on the
  "Smeg-Ups" video (see "Where can I get videotapes of RED DWARF?").
 
------------------------------

Subject: What's in canister 1121?

  According to the RED DWARF QUIZ BOOK (see "Are the books about RED
  DWARF?"), it's the remains of Kristine Kochanski.  When Lister comes
  back to life on the backwards Earth, he discovers that he's married to
  an elderly version of Kochanski.  Presumably, treating the canister
  with gamma and X rays was part of Holly's plan for restoring her to
  life along with Lister.  (If none of this makes any sense to you, you
  haven't read the ending of the novel BETTER THAN LIFE -- see "What is
  RED DWARF?".)

  The original script for "The End" included a scene (cut from the final
  version) in which Lister placed the powdered remains of each
  crewmember in a separate canister and ejected them all into space (and
  this is done with George McIntyre's remains in the aired version).
  It's reasonable to conclude that Lister did this, although nothing is
  said about it in either the episode or the novel.  The number of
  canisters floating in space ("something in the region of ten
  thousand") is consistent with the size of the crew given in INFINITY
  WELCOMES CAREFUL DRIVERS (eleven thousand, one hundred and
  sixty-nine).

Subject: Are there books about RED DWARF?

  Numerous RED DWARF reference works are available:

  THE OFFICIAL RED DWARF COMPANION
  by Bruce Dessau
  ISBN 1-85286-456-7
  Titan, 1992

  This thin little book (95 pages) has a lot of wasted space, but some
  interesting quotes and information and some wonderful color photos
  throughout.  If you're looking for in-depth, solid information about
  the show, this isn't where you'll find it; but if you want a nice,
  light read, a collector's item, and an attractive coffee-table book,
  this is it.  Available in England and at conventions in the U.S.

  RED DWARF PROGRAMME GUIDE
  by Chris Howarth and Steve Lyons
  ISBN 0-86-369682-1
  Virgin, 1995

  "Everything you never wanted to know about the smash smega-series."
  An in-depth collection (about 230 pages) of information about series
  1-5.  It includes sections on History, The Characters, The Programmes,
  The Index, The Creators (cast and production crew), and The Spin-offs.
  The Index is by far the largest section of the book and is an
  alphabetical list of almost everything mentioned to during the series,
  from "A to Z of Red Dwarf, The" to "Zoom function".

  Note: This book contains an incorrect address for the Official RED
  DWARF Fan Club (U.K.).  For the correct address, see "Are there RED
  DWARF fan clubs?".

  RED DWARF -- PRIMORDIAL SOUP: THE LEAST WORST SCRIPTS
  by Grant Naylor
  ISBN 0-14-017886-4
  Penguin, 1993

  This book contains the complete scripts for "Polymorph," "Marooned,"
  "Dimension Jump," "Justice," "Back to Reality," and "Psirens."  Not
  published in the U.S., but available from John McElroy (see "Where can
  I get other RED DWARF merchandise?") and other distributors of
  imported books.

  THE MAN IN THE RUBBER MASK
  by Robert Llewellyn
  ISBN 0-14-023575-2
  Penguin, 1994

  A very nice little book, detailing Llewellyn's involvement in RED
  DWARF from the beginning of Series 3 through the filming of the
  American pilots (see "Is there an American RED DWARF?").  Predictably,
  there is some complaining about the Rubber Mask, but only a little.
  There are plenty of anecdotes and stories, and lots of trivia.  The
  section on the American pilots is especially revealing, and gives some
  plausible reasons why the whole project fell through.  Not an
  essential purchase for RED DWARF fans, but a very good one indeed.

  THE MAKING OF RED DWARF
  by Joe Nazzaro
  ISBN 0-14-023206-0
  Penguin, 1994

  A rather slender book with lots of nice colour photographs.  Focuses
  on the making of "Gunmen Of The Apocalypse".  The book goes into a
  fair amount of detail, but nothing that couldn't have been gleaned
  from a half-dozen back issues of the now-defunct SMEGAZINE (see "Are
  there RED DWARF magazines?"). The book's main strength is the added
  material: some great photos, fragments of the original "Gunmen" script
  (mostly stage directions, but also one unfilmed scene) and storyboards
  used in the filming.  The back of the book contains information on how
  you can purchase RED DWARF paraphernalia such as t-shirts, baseball
  caps, and models of Starbug and Kryten.

  RED DWARF QUIZ BOOK
  by Nicky Hooks and Sharon Burnett
  ISBN 0-14-023662-7
  Penguin, 1994

  RED DWARF trivia and mind-bending teasers.  Contains questions such as
  "What was referred to as a small off-duty Czechoslovakian traffic
  warden?", crosswords, word searches, "who said . . .", information about
  the cast, and photos.  After a while, though, you have to wonder about
  the mind of someone who can put together questions such as "What
  follows the leaflet campaign?" or "What was in canister 1121?"

| imitation Flibble erasers to those interested."  To subscribe, email
| Holly5120@aol.com -- put "RD List" in the subject line and "Flobber
| dob blib blob bleeb, please" as the message (or just ask to be signed

------------------------------

Subject: Should I post RED DWARF graphic images and sounds?

  Please don't post uuencoded binaries to alt.tv.red-dwarf or to the RED
  DWARF mailing list -- they're for discussion only.  Upload your
  graphic images, sounds, or programs to one of the FTP sites (see
  "Where can I find online information about RED DWARF?") or post them
  to an appropriate alt.binaries.* newsgroup.  Then post an article to
  alt.tv.red-dwarf or the mailing list telling everyone where you put
  the goodies.

  There are good reasons for this request.  First of all, uuencoded
  binaries take up a lot of space.  Many sites simply do not have disk
  space for them.  If you start posting binaries, those sites will be
  forced to drop the newsgroup, depriving everyone at that site of news
  and information about RED DWARF.

  Also, many people have to pay for their net access by the second.
  Huge binaries cost those people a lot of money.  Those people may be
  forced to stop receiving newsgroups and mailing lists to which binaries
  are posted.  Thus we are deprived of their wit and wisdom.

  Summary: If you post binaries, everybody suffers.

Subject: Are there RED DWARF magazines?

  RED DWARF SMEGAZINE, the official magazine for the series, ceased
  publication with Volume 2 Issue 9 (December 1993).  Some back issues

  other RED DWARF merchandise?").

Subject: Is there a RED DWARF computer game?

  Not yet, but there may be one someday.  Dino Boni, a journalist
  working for a U.K. computer magazine, reported in June 1994 that two
  software companies were considering publishing a graphical RED DWARF
  adventure game for the IBM PC.

  axel@origin.ea.com reports the following: "In 1991 I was working for
  Imagitec Design, a computer games company based in Dewsbury, West
  Yorkshire, England.  We had a full game design/plot written up and
  partially storyboarded, ready to be submitted for approval from Grant
  & Naylor.  They were very excited about the prospect of a game since
  the 'Better Than Life' theme would link nicely to the series.  We
  approached Gremlin Graphics, in Sheffield, to handle the licensing.
  The deal came to a standstill when Noel Gay TV wanted way too much
  money for the license and so the game never saw the light of day."

  There are two DOS computer viruses ("Pathogen" and "Queeg") written by
| Christopher Pile, evidently a RED DWARF fan.  When activated, the
  "Pathogen" virus displays the following message:

Your hard-disk is being corrupted, courtesy of PATHOGEN!
 Programmed in the U.K.  (Yes, NOT Bulgaria!) [C] The Black Baron 1993-4.
  Featuring SMEG v0.1:  Simulated Metamorphic Encryption Generator!
   'Smoke me a kipper, I`ll be back for breakfast.....'
     Unfortunately some of your data won't!!!!!

  These viruses were first detected in February of 1994.  Reuters
| reported on 22 July 1994 that Pile had been arrested and charged with
| creating the viruses.  On 16 November 1995, the U.K. newspaper THE
| DAILY MAIL reported that Pile had been sentenced to 18 months in
| prison for the damage done by the viruses (estimated to be at least
| 500,000 pounds worth in the U.K. alone.

Subject: Has RED DWARF won any awards?

  At the 1994 International Emmy Awards, the RED DWARF episode "Gunmen
  of the Apocalypse," tied with ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS (Series 2:
  "Hospital") in the Popular Arts category.  The International Emmys are
  awarded by the International Council of the National Academy of TV
  Arts & Sciences.  RED DWARF was also nominated for International Emmys
  in 1987, 1989, and 1992.

  At the 1994 British Comedy Awards, RED DWARF won Best BBC Situation
  Comedy.

  At Eastercon 1989 and 1992, RED DWARF received the Best Dramatic
