                       He's back yet again..


Whenever I start a new one of these, it is always the tacit recognition 
of the long haul ahead to the next completed new issue,  this one being 
the not insignificant issue twenty,  which also leans towards being our 
sixth birthday issue..

In  a generally 'slow news' period since Maggie 19 came out,  one thing 
has  dominated  the minds and mouths of people close to us,  is it  the 
Sellout  and  transfer  of Atari to another company??  No,  it  is  the 
appearance  of the mysterious ST on the BBC Thursday night  music  show 
'Top of the Pops!!'

This  ST  seems to be stage dressing for the more  keyboard  orientated 
acts  that play 'live' on the show ('live' - mimed!  - whatever!!)  The 
most  recent,  at  time of writing,  user of this machine was the Euro-
Technophile Robert Miles bringing his hit 'Children' to the UK.. 

The ST concerned does not seem to be doing too much,  as we try to spot 
through  a hellish screen flicker to find out that there only seems  to 
be a single drive icon and probably a trash icon on an otherwise  blank 
screen.. The computer seems to be miming as well!!

If the defunct Atari concern at Slough should start to receive piles of 
mail about the mysterious computer on 'TOTP', I'd be very surprised!!

                         Atari World go down..

Compo  Software have recently gone into liquidation,  taking the  Atari 
World magazine down with it..

Bummer..

                        Amiga sold yet again..

After  substaining huge losses,  'Retailer of the Year' Escom have sold 
their interest in Amiga Technologies on.. 

It is not as if they were doing a lot with it in the first place  after 
all..

Dissolve  and fade to typical ESCOM shop in everytown shopping  arcade,  
the UK..  Joe Punter enters the shop,  bright and breezy assistant with 
pasted  on smile rushes forward to grab punters attention  hoping  that 
punter  won't spot the pile of Amiga boxes on the floor..  PUNTER trips 
up on one and falls in undignified heap on the floor..

"Ah....."

"I'm sorry about that sir, now if I.."

"Actually, I'd quite like to buy one of those Amigas.."

"Come away from that display sir,  a sad mistake on our part,  wouldn't 
you like a nice PC instead??"

"No, I quite fancy one of those Amiga things.."

"No I'm sure sir would much rather enjoy one of our PCs instead.."

"NO, I'D LIKE TO BUY ONE OF YOUR AMIGAS.." - Firmly

"But  sir,  we've deliberately f*cked around with the specifications so 
it  won't  work  with half of the old stuff anymore,  we've  only  been 
stuffed with this old tat so we can sell PCs with the Commodore logo on 
anyway,  and we'd rather not have them in here in the first place.. NOW 
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A PC!"

-  Paper thin mask of courtesy falls away at sales assistant's  display 
of   naked   anger   at  cheapskate  customer's   resistance   to   his 
blandishments..

"GET ME THE MANAGER NOW!!!"

"I'm the store manager sir, is there a problem?"

"Yes, this idiot insists on refusing to give me what I want!"

(Concerned soothing managerial voice)
"I'm  very  sorry to hear that sir,  we're only here to help you  after 
all.. Now can I interest you in a nice PC....."

And  on and on..  Will they have better luck with their new owners,  we 
shall see..


                       Atari 1996, the latest.. 

Atari/JTS  Corp  have made some of their intentions for  the  near  and 
middle term future clear vis a vis Jaguar and related products..

Atari are concentrating on getting rid of existing stock built up  over 
1995..  The fact that it has not sold as well as it should is reflected 
in  the information that the last manufacturing of Jaguars was in  mid-
1995,  with none ordered since..  'Test marketing',  that is dumping of 
the  existing stock will continue throughout 1996,  and is expected  to 
decline once this stock is gone..

Some  'limited' development of software will continue,  even now,  some 
previously  stricken  titles such as 'Fight for Life'  and  'Myst'  are 
being  released,   with  some  others  in  the  pipeline..   The  Atari 
Interactive  project converting Jag titles to the PC will  continue  as 
well..  Anyone  considering the lack of marketing activity will not  be 
surprised  to  note that Atari expenditure on this was  slightly  lower 
than  in  1994,  at  12.7 million dollars in 1995,  compared with  14.7 
million for the previous year..

Atari are now down to 25 employees in the US..

Atari  are  also taking out lawsuits against various  people  including 
Probe  Software..  Details  of this are unclear,  but may relate to the 
termination or non-delivery of Mortal Kombat III for the Jaguar?

Well there it is folks..


             Ed Cleveland Interlude warning type thing..

TAUNTON  UPDATE   Further  to last  issues' sinister revelations about
the  mysterious town of Taunton, it  has been discovered  that another
ST diskmag editor has been  drawn into  its' gravitational  pull. Yes,
none  other than one Richard  Karsmakers, editor of ST News  has  been
there too.

In  the "small screen"  film reviews  of ST News 10.1  the Karsic  one
reveals  that he  bought a  copy of the horror film  "Hellraiser"  for 
œ4.99  at  Our Price in Taunton, whilst on a visit  to  England. 

It  was  previously  thought that  the Taunton  Terror  began  when  a 
certain  diskmag  editor,  who wishes to remain anonymous but that  is 
too  bad  eh James Mathews (Ed -the editor,not Ed Cleveland,ohh dear!!)
travelled  to Rushden for a  Jammie Dodgers eating contest er, birthday
celebration, only to end up in Taunton.But it seems Taunton is stronger
than  we  first thought. Its sinister influence had previously radiated
out  all  the  way to Utrecht in The Netherlands. 

So, if  you edit an  ST diskmag - beware! Is your  name  CIH, Slimer or
Vogue? Perhaps  it is  Keefy or  Genie? If it is, you could be the next
victim of Taunton. Be  careful.  Have  your wits about you at all times.
Observe the following  precautions:

1. Do not fall asleep on any trains.

2. Do not attend any birthday parties without first finding out the
   name of the place  you  are  going  to.

3. Do not come over to England to meet your girlfriend and  buy  some
   Steven King books.

4. Do not underestimate the power of Playstation.


           Whatever Happened To... Episode seventy-three..

You  remember  something  called 'Cool J Charlie'  who  starred  in  a 
Megademo main menu made by the Wild Boys.. This was intended to be the 
precursor  to a game very much in the Super Mario mould,  with quite a 
lot  of Sonic in it..  The demo was released and a preview of the game 
was shown at the 1992 Bradford Coding Convention.. Maggie Team regular 
Mr Pink attended the event and saw it in action.. 

Describing  it  thus  in issue 2 of the  sadly  demised  'HP   Source' 
diskmag..


"Powerman's game, 'Cool J Charlie'  has been up  and running - I  must 
say that it bears a  striking  resemblance  to  Enchanted  Lands  with
the  same  genre of graphics, raster colours which seem  identical  to
the  ones chosen by TCB and also smooth hardware scrolling.  What with
Magnum doing the  graphics and Demon-X  working on the sound, the game
is technically very good. Whether the gameplay matches this is open to
debate..."


After this expert appraisal.. We saw nothing more of the game for four 
years, but it has recently turned up again in a surprising fashion..

I was browsing a recent issue of Amiga Format yes, I know, it's called 
'Necessary Research' and it paid off handsomely this time,  as I found 
no  less  than  'Cool J Charlie' now alive on  the  Amiga,  and  being 
reviewed by a non too impressed Amiga Format staff.. They described it 
as  'Stunningly Average!' The Wild Boys made it clear at the  Bradford 
Convention  that they were leaving the ST for the Amiga..  Maybe  that 
was not such a good idea after all!!


                         Recently Overheard..

An amusing quote heard in a computer store.. The sort that sells those 
glorified orange boxes with an 'Intel Inside' badge..

Assistant to customer..

"So why do you want to get Windows 95??"

Customer..

"Well it's something new, isn't it.."

Assistant (off the cuff but to the point..)

"So is AIDS sir, but I wouldn't recommend that to you either!"


                    But what of the alternatives?

Whilst  the  happy  tale above was being related to me,  the  man  who 
overheard  it  was wrestling with a totally new  set  of  installation 
hassles for his PC..

Now  Nathan (It is he of previous issues) is something of a UNIX  guru 
and  slam-dunks  all kinds of operating systems for a  living..  After 
Windows  95 managed to trash a large numbers of files on his own  hard 
disk,  he  decided  on a clean sweep and a new operating system,  just 
having  taken delivery of the Walnut Creek CD containing  the  Berkely 
University UNIX implementation (BSD)..

It "only" took four hours or so to set up..  Laugh, I might have done, 
but I was too busy stifling the yawns instead..

We  started  with  a complete hard drive re-format,  as his  main  IDE 
device  was  a  basket case with all the errors donated  to  it  by  a 
certain  other  unmentionable  operating system..  This is  made  more 
'interesting  by  the  fact that a lot of newer  PCs  don't  have  the 
reformatting  commands  built in,  so he had to initiate this from  an 
older 386 machine sitting alongside it..

Getting on to the CD, this was straightforward if 'several cups of tea 
later'  time consuming..  The problems started when he (note:- I DON'T 
say  'we'!) selected all the 300-odd applications that came  with  the 
package to go onto disk.. After an hour or so of installing, it became 
apparent that there was no hard disk space left.. Cue controlled panic 
style  exit from the install procedure,  and try to sort out what's on 
there already.. 

Running  BSD  reveals  a few other items  of  trickiness,  as  initial 
contact  is  made via a DOS-like keyboard  command  syntax,  whereupon 
Nathan finds out that the BSD version of UNIX is ever so slightly non-
standard..  Not enough to flummox him,  but enough to cause a fair bit 
of misdirection.. 

Much time is spent trying to get X-Windows to talk to the machine, but 
we  only  get a grotty lo-res text only  window..  Extensive  fiddling 
around with various 'AUTOEXEC.BAT' type thingies eventually brings  up 
a  hi-res  grotty text only window,  and then, finally,  the X-Windows 
system itself..

To  look  at,  X-Windows  does  look pretty  smart  on  the  graphical 
interface  end of things,  and is capable of some HUGE virtual  screen 
modes,  not to mention things like genuine multi-user capability, even 
on  the same PC with a system of 'virtual terminals'..  Compared  with 
something like Windows '95, it looks like a winner..

However, to end on a smug note..

Moral  1,  If  the grass is greener on the other side of the  pasture, 
then someone has probably thrown a can of green paint all over it..

Moral 2,  Make sure you are fully awake,  and your computer is, before 
attempting anything serious, such as a whole new operating system..

Moral  3,  I've  always wanted to do a Jerry Pournelle  Byte  magazine 
style  'Chaos  Manor' story of the "Rocket scientist  brought  low  by 
arcane  PC technology and video card clash" style and so on,  but  not 
one involving any pain and suffering to myself!!


                       Acorn meets the Oracle..

Acorn  Computers are  reported  to be  involved in  a new low  priced 
internet capable  computer  or  terminal.  This apparently  uses RISC
or similar technology,it is intended to plug into a common television
rather  than  a  SVGA  type dedicated  monitor..  At  its lowest end,
without 'luxuries' like hard drive or floppy drive storage, a minimal
one  or  two  meg  of memory,  it is intended to retail for a similar
price to a mid-range video recorder.. The figure that has been widely
suggested is $3-500..It will probably be bundled with a Web viewer in
ROM,  and  is  designed  as  a deliberate  antidote  to  the  current
generation of  PCs,  which  Acorn consider as too clumsy or expensive
for the average householder.. The big business partner behind this is 
a USA based concern, Oracle..

What this  will  turn out like is anyone's guess.. Whether it  is  an 
Amstrad-like gimmick to cash in on the instant popularity of the 'Net,
or a  starting  point for  a real alternative  technology base to the 
Intel/Microsoft monopoly on personal computers remains to be seen..

Bill Gates,  amongst others,  is dismissive of the idea of a 'Web PC', 
claiming  that PC prices will start to fall as performance limits  are 
reached with the current PC technology.. We shall see..

Worth keeping a little bit of an eye on perhaps..


   VoGue joins the 20th Century, World catches fire in amazement!!

My little friend John, the proprieter and chief editor of  the   Atari 
'Web Locator WWW pages,  has finally done  what was said by many to be
impossible..  He has added  to his menagerie  of Atari hardware with a
bouncing baby STe..

The One meg youngster is due to replace some of his other  ageing  kit, 
such  as  the STF that was so old that it had its serial number written 
under the  case in  Latin..  It  should play an  invaluable role in his
future excursions on the Internet,  and hours  of  mindless blowing the
crap out of things in Sub-Station..

It  won't however be doing a lot more of Skynet Times..  (See  Diskmag 
reviews for more info as to 'why'..)

Nice one VoGue!!


                       Sega depart from 'Mars'

For  those  people who feel a bit hard done by with  Atari  and  their 
unique 'hands off' approach to the Jaguar console..

Sega  have  recently  dropped product support for their  Mega  CD  for 
Megadrive  and 32X add-on booster for the same machine..  You may well 
recall  some  predictions in Maggie 14 in this very same  column  that 
both  these items of hardware would be the first for the chop if  Sega 
ever  realised  that they were carrying too many  different  lines  of 
retail hardware and decided to reorganise..  Well its finally happened 
as they are concentrating exclusively on Saturn, waving goodbye to the 
rather grey and crusty Megadrive in the process.. I think that 32X was 
one  piece  of equipment that had even less support than  the  Jaguar, 
whilst you could count the number of good games for the Mega CD on the 
fingers of a man who has had both arms amputated in a car crash!

We're not too surprised really..


            Whatever Happened to.. Episode Seventy-Four..  

We  have  learnt  that Martin Griffiths,  aka Griff,  formerly of  the 
Resistance/Inner  Circle/whatever  has  gone  to  work  for   software 
publisher Electronic Arts.. Good luck mate!!

Also  that EKO (Extremely Kriminal Organisation) have quit  any  large 
scale  activity on the Falcon as they have also been recruited  by  an 
unknown software house.. Good luck again..

(Any news of their unreleased games would be gratefully appreciated..)


                    Amstrad buyout on the cards..

Fans of Alan Michael Sugar,  the Amstrad CPC series of computers et al 
may  be surprised to learn that he is actively trying to sell off  his 
remaining  stake in Amstrad holdings..  A merger or buyout with  Psion 
Computers  is on the cards..  Amstrad is presently valued in excess of 
200  million  pounds..  Amstrad  without  Alan Sugar  is  a  bit  like 
imagining  'Red  Dwarf' without Rob Grant and Doug  Naylor  doing  the 
scripts,  erm, which is actually going to be the case for series seven 
of that show!


           'Edge' Magazine finally go Ga-Ga over Nintendo..

Longtime  readers of Maggie will remember that  unfortunate  magazines 
tendency to idolise a certain fashionable 'of the moment' console, and 
then  drop it like a used plate of haddock as soon as something  newer 
comes onto the horizon..

Well  they've  finally  dropped  their  unreal  worship  of  the  Sony 
PlayStation,  now  disgracefully the day before yesterdays technology, 
for  the  all  new shining and very delayed Nintendo  Ultra  64,  this 
months bandwagon to be jumped..

God it's so good to be seen with the 'In' crowd!!

Arse!!

                                End..

That's  your  lot for this issue of Maggie..  See you all  again  next 
time..

 CiH - Various in 1996..
