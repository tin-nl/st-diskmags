Now  would anyone have cared to make bets that we have managed a  third 
year  on a computer with so little official support when it first  came 
out..  Certainly,  we have experienced a third year on the Falcon scene 
which  has  been  as challenging and enjoyable as the  other  two  that 
preceded it.. Lots of things have happened, not all of them necessarily 
good, but woven into the rich fabric of life etc..

C-Lab pitch in..
Sound  Technologies have quietly got on with selling their  version  of 
the computer into their target market,  the music and MIDI applications 
field..  Sales  have  been  enough  to encourage  further  support  and 
development of new and more purpose built models (Rack casing etc), but 
no sign of any general assault on the home/consumer market as initially 
hoped, and this is probably on indefinite hold..

Atari pitch over..
Atari,  having  managed  to  fumble  Jaguar,  merged with JTS  Corp,  a 
manufacturer of hard drives (Seagate..) Some limited support of  Jaguar 
seems to be still on the cards,  but no more TOS based hardware is ever 
likely from that source ever again..

There was *that* MicroBox rumour in the middle of '95,  a machine which 
probably never got beyond the prototype stage..

(One interesting rumour suggests a further active third party  interest 
in  the  TOS/Falcon hardware and firmware which may  just  realise  the 
machine's full potential if it does come about!!)

The Atari World Experiment..
Into  the gap left by the merger of ST Review and ST Format came  Atari 
World!  This  independent (sponsored by Compo Software) production  was 
produced by the ex-staffers of ST review, and was the story of 1995 for 
all  shades  of Atari users,  and not just Falcon people..  Tragically, 
this  was  killed at the beginning of this year by  financial  problems 
which claimed Compo Software as well..  Which left us back where we had 
started last year..

Falcon Maggie Shell at Last!!
Okay,  you are all sick of hearing about this,  but in August 1995, the 
long  dreamed  for Falcon specific Maggie shell came  about  thanks  to 
Leon, 'Reservoir Gods' O'Reilly.. It (intentionally) coincided with the 
not insignificant Maggie Fifth Anniversary..

The Year of the Accelerator..
Over  the  previous  twelve months,  a lot of people have  been  coming 
around  to  the idea of putting a bit of extra poke in  their  Falcon.. 
Several  products  have  appeared  to  encourage  this  sort  of  loose 
behaviour,  ranging  from  the very HEAVY DUTY Afterburner  '040  card, 
through to easier to handle things such as the System Solutions  Blowup 
FX  extender  card,  a  three  in  one  system  including  easy  memory 
expansion,  and  the Blowup screen expander with the processor booster, 
through to an interesting cheap accelerator from Titan designs,  called 
'Nemesis' which is due sort of soonish..

Seriousness..
All  current  essential  doobries  got a  version  with  '4'  in  their 
nonclamature this last year.. Such as Neodesk 4, Geneva 4, and the long 
awaited Falcon enhanced MagiC 4..  Also Imagecopy 4 is in there...  The 
only one behind the times is Apex Media, with version 3 due soon..
 
There  was  a  pick up in interest of things  online,  as  viable  'Web 
browsers  such as Crystal Browser,  and improved Internet software came 
to  us  in 1995-6..  The 'Web environment,  designed with a Hi Res  256 
colour capable PC in mind,  is best suited to a Falcon really.. Several 
'Web pages for Atari related subjects including certain demo groups and 
some well known and much loved diskmags started to appear!!

STOS came to the Falcon,  with a powerful extension produced by Anthony 
Jacques..

Various  sound trackers appeared,  with Digital going fully commercial, 
and the superb shareware Graoumf Tracker coming this year..

Explosive growth in choice of CD ROMs and interest in CD ownership, and 
the  first Falcon specific collections,  even the first two games on CD 
for the '030..

Silliness..
Another vintage year for this too.. Reservoir Gods came up with two big 
releases  for  1995,  Tautology  II,  and  their long  awaited  'Double 
Bobble',  a fully featured platformer, based on a certain famous arcade 
game from long ago!!

The Word is 'Doom!'
Of  most  interest  on  the games front this  year,  were  the  various 
attempts  at  doing a Doom style 3-D game..  First up,  was the STe and 
Falcon   game   Substation,   from   those   pinball   wizards   Unique 
Developments..  This  compromised  somewhat  by limiting  the  game  to 
gouraud shading,  but proved to be very popular..  Unique Developments, 
in  their  wisdom  then decided to leave the ST  and  Falcon,  although 
Obsession Falcon had been given to the care of Merlin ,and should still 
be released eventually..  Other projects surfacing include the freeware 
'Bad Mood' project .WAD player, which still seems some way from being a 
full  game,  and  the  more  appetising 'Running',  a  nearly  complete 
outgrowth  of the Doomino demo  seen at the Fried Bits  III  Convention 
last April..

Others  are  still in the pipeline,  including one non-Falcon  specific 
project called 'Kill Things', even as we write!!

Also  this  year saw the release of more of the lost Atari  games  from 
16/32,  and  some  new  games such as Platonix and  Confusion..  Merlin 
graced us with Killing Impact, Joust with steroids for the Falcon.. 

Games  for  1996  look very promising,  with some of the  Doom  related 
material coming to maturity, more new Reservoir Gods games (Skyfall now 
released)  and several other games from the demo crews seen in  preview 
form recently..

Demos..
Various  ground breaking demos came out in 1995..  We started with  the 
Obnoxious  demo,  then  hit the Fried Bits III at speed..  Lost  Blubb, 
probably  Lazer's  finest  hour,  took  Falcon  demos  into  multimedia 
territory..  EKO's  System  demo  showed the finest work yet  with  3-D 
effects..  The  concept  of 96K intro was twisted inside out  with  the 
stunning 'Terrorise Your Soul' demo..  A full demo in 96K!! Later on in 
the year we saw Exa,  and Hydroxid,  and saw some of the efforts put in 
by  the Scandinavian scene,  with releases (almost) by NoCrew and  Dead 
Hackers Society (reviewed this issue!) Hints of a demo to blow them all 
away from Aggression started to appear, and we should see 'Motion Blur' 
sometime in the summer (finally..)

The  future here is bright,  although Symposium was not up to the  best 
that  Fried  Bits  had to offer..  There are many other  demos  in  the 
pipeline,   and  seemingly  several  coding  conventions  in  different 
countries to come as well..  

Prospects..
It is anyones year..

In terms of 'Big Brother' support,  that is official new machines, this 
has faded quietly away,  as C-Lab have realised the extent of what they 
can  do  with  the  machine,  that  is a limited  support  for  a  very 
specialist  niche  market,  although  they do claim  to  support  other 
serious and other multimedia applications.. The one rumour which we are 
not allowed to say a lot about originates from the USA and may  involve 
some  very  big players..  Perhaps a Falcon 'Net PC or  even  something 
bigger??

In terms of the existing user base, that is, 'scene' or non-scene, some 
changes  are  becoming  apparent..  There seems to have  been  a  quiet 
convergence  of  these differing approaches,  at least here in the  UK, 
with  more people who might be though of as living exclusively  on  the 
'serious'  side  taking an interest in  non-standard  productions  like 
Maggie (Both us and DBA were reviewed in Atari World last year..)

I think the major trend for 1996 will be a further pulling together  of 
the remaining Atari and Falcon users,  especially those that get online 
access..

More people will take up PCs, but that cannot be avoided.. However, the 
PC market is in such a state of total insanity,  hype and overkill, and 
may  hopefully slump soon..  I don't recommend that anyone sells  their 
Falcon  just  to get a PC as there is still lots of life left  in  this 
beast yet!!

They  still make demos and play games on the Commodore 64  after  all!! 
Obsolescence is only a state of mind!!
