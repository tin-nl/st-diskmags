There can be very few Atarians that have not come across the word 
STOS in their computer lifetime. Surrounded by myths and a 
certain stigma in the programming community, this language has at 
last come of age and matured into a highly versatile and powerful 
tool capable of commercial quality products normally only 
associated with assembler type languages. Unrecognisable from its 
original incarnation STOS can no longer be classed as a simple 
game maker.

Originally labelled "The Game Creator", STOS has been through 
many transitions over the years, the original copyright owners, 
Mandarin Software no longer support the product, but many third 
party developers are actively supporting the language. Top Notch 
Software literally dragged STOS into the nineties with their 
Misty and Missing Link extensions. Other major upgrades from 
various programmers include Extra, Control and the recently well 
received Falcon extensions.

Extensions are upgrades to STOS, adding new commands and in some 
cases replacing existing commands with a far superior 
alternative. There are 32 extensions available at this time, 
together with four currently in production. This constitutes a 
major revamp to the language. As well as the larger extensions, 
that will normally consist of between 30 to 60 commands each 
covering a wide range of subjects, you will also find a whole 
array of smaller but just as useful extensions. Titles to 
consider are Cyber the *.SEQ animation player, MIDI includes 
computer linking commands and of course the many STe extensions 
that take advantage of the DMA, Blitter and extended palettes as 
well as other specific commands for the STe.

The Falcon has not been neglected. True colour sprite routines 
and DSP playback of 4-32 channel MODules at 50kHz 16-bit stereo 
is enough to make any programmer rush out and buy a Falcon just 
for the pleasure of using Anthony Jacques STOS Falcon Extension 
v1.2b. With 4-65536 colour graphic routines, FLI and FLC true 
colour playback commands as well as full access to the sound 
system (including DSP processing) this is a must-have extension 
for any Falcon owning STOS programmer.

The graphic handling capabilities of STOS have always been the 
envy of its competitors, unfortunately the terms "slow", "jerky" 
and "unresponsive" have also been associated with it, the latter 
comments certainly warranted in earlier examples of STOS games 
where every man and his dog tried their hand at programming. 
However the situation has now changed, although it is still 
possible to knock together a disappointing piece of software. 
What this series will show you is that you now have the software 
available to program a commercial quality product that would 
grace any disk collection.

Before discussing any serious programming techniques we must 
first put to rest the myths surrounding STOS BASIC,

Slow? Normally attributed to the screen copying commands, these 
have been replaced many times in various extensions. Fastcopy 
from the Misty extension proving to be the fastest when using 
variables to denote source and destination screens. To 
demonstrate the capabilities of such commands, take an old 
routine and change all the screencopy commands with the 
equivalent fastcopy and there will be an instant speed increase. 
This example works especially well with old demo screens.

Jerky? Sprites and screen scrolling have always had to endure 
such remarks. The STOS sprite engine has been totally replaced 
with the Missing Link's extensive Bob and Joey commands. Sprites 
have the advantage of being simple to use as they are shifted 
across the screen in real time, but as this takes up a rather 
large chunk of processor time then it is also their downfall. 
Bobs and Joeys are pre-shifted then the appropriate images pasted 
onto the specified screen, this in turn frees up enough processor 
time to allow more bobs per sprite ratios as well as an increased 
freedom of movement.

Unresponsive? Again levelled at the STOS sprites, coupled with 
the Bob commands you now have access to more joystick control, 
including the twin joystick drivers, STe ports and the seventeen 
button Jaguar control pad.

Incompatibility? By far the biggest set back in the progress of 
STOS as a serious programming language, until now, we have always 
had various forms of fixer programs that had to be distributed to 
anyone with a TOS version higher than 1.62, however compiled STOS 
programs can now be fixed before release using the Generic STOS 
fixer. This program will work for up to 10 OS versions - the 
tables for these are supplied with the program (1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 
1.04, 1.06, 1.62, 2.05, 2.06, 4.04, 4.92). There are 4 other OS 
versions (3.05, 3.06, 4.01 and 4.02) as well as numerous versions 
of MagiC. The author does not guarantee using this version will 
successfully fix your program to work on every OS, some 
programming guidelines have to be followed for a higher rate of 
success.

Not content with extensions adding hundreds of new commands to 
STOS BASIC, we also have the option to add machine code - all 
high level programming languages can benefit from low level help. 
STOS can load a machine code routine into a memory bank and call 
that routine from within a BASIC listing and the option to pass 
parameters to the code also exists in many examples.

Currently there are 21 documented machine code routines available 
to STOS users. Examples of these are routines to allow 16kHz MOD 
playback on a standard ST, Quartet players with FM and STe 
options, full colour spectrum picture viewers and more recently 
the ability to load and display *.GIF pictures, the latter of 
which also accepts pictures larger than the physical screen with 
the ability to scroll. There are machine code programs that will 
allow the removal of the upper and lower borders and even one 
that lets you have complete overscan. 

Assembler code can be added to STOS and indeed it is possible to 
make true *.APP or *.TTP software. Although labelled the Game 
Creator, STOS can be used for just about any task on your Atari. 
There now exist commands, routines and programs that will enable 
you to totally disguise the fact that STOS has been used. There 
are commercial and shareware programs in existence today that are 
fooling even the most experienced atari users who would have 
otherwise shunned the software untried, merely because it was 
written in STOS BASIC.

All STOS users should upgrade their language disk now. You should 
consult your local public domain library, or choose one from the 
many advertising in these pages and acquire a minimum of three 
top extensions. Misty and Missing Link are essential to any 
program that relies on graphics and are especially vital to any 
game maker. Your actual language disk should already be at 
version 2.06 and your compiler at version 2.07 - upgrades are 
freely available from public domain libraries.

Extra has some nice graphical commands, including the PPSC pixel 
perfect screen copy command that allows chunks of screen to be 
cut and pasted ignoring the sixteen pixel boundary, but is noted 
for a more serious approach. The extension now boasts a packer as 
well as printer control and cookie jar access. With 62 commands 
to its credit you cannot afford to be without it, along with the 
Misty and Missing link you will be adding in excess of 132 new 
commands to your STOS language disk.

As you can see, STOS is now a programming language to be reckoned 
with and next month I will show you exactly how to get the best 
out of it. So root out those language disks and order your 
extensions in time for the next issue's tutorials.


Even the internet has been touched by STOS. There is a STOS 
mailing list where information, help and the latest STOS news can 
be found. Email: jacquesa@cs.man.ac.uk for details. Incidentally, 
this is also the Email for information regarding the Falcon 
extension and generic STOS fixer. Some prolific STOS programmers 
are on the net and have their own WEB pages where you can 
download their latest releases, upgrades or simply read about 
their current projects. All can be linked to from by far the 
largest STOS specific site on the net at 
http://www.airtime.co.uk/users/stosser/

No introduction to STOS would be complete without mentioning 
STOSser Diskzine. Established in April 1993 it is still going 
strong and currently at issue 26. Every issue is packed to the 
brim with articles and tutorials as well as BASIC source code for 
your examination. Contributors include the most experienced STOS 
programmers as well as extension programmers. There are all 
manner of articles ranging from idiot guides to adding assembler 
to your code. The diskzine has recently been handed over to long 
time contributor Dean (Deano) Sharples, author of the Graphic 
Adventure Creator series. For more information on STOSser 
software write to Deano at 27 Turbary Walk, Milnrow, Rochdale,

               List compiled by Tony Greenwood, December 1995


  Extensions are upgrades to STOS BASIC but have the advantage of being 
choosable?, you can decide what upgrades to use, do not let anyone fool 
you into believing that the use of extensions is by some way cheating, 
it isn't, it is how STOS is upgraded, if GFA is upgraded then everyone 
doesent cry cheat!, Extensions are extra commands for your language that 
you must learn how to use,
