     Candyman is a very compatible game, it runs on ST, STE, Mega STE,
TT 030, Falcon 030 and looks like it would probably run on a Spectrum.

     The plot is  ..  bizarre.   You  are  being  chased  by  an 'evil
toothfairy', as you try to gobble  all  the 'candies' you can get your
teeth into.  Just why the  toothfairy  is  chasing you is not evident,
perhaps it is fed-up of having to  pay  children for losing their very
rotten teeth.  Anyway it has a  vendetta against you in particular and
its rage (speed) increases as you eat more candies.  And yet (and here
is the real elegance and beauty of it) to complete the level, you must
eat all the candies.  Hmm.  Sounds a bit like Pac-Man really.

     There is no conventional intro  to  this  game, a brief resume of
the said plot and an explanation  of control methods available (cursor
keys or joystick) and  we're  into  the  stunning,  arcade action that
isn't Candyman.

     You control a (8x8?)  sprite,  with  no  frames  of animation and
possibly 3 colours.  You use it  to  eat strange, angular, grey blobs,
which we assume are candies.   The  toothfairy,  a blue blob with some
green spikes, chases you around the level.  It mirrors your movements,
so that when you move down, it  also  moves down (as long as there are
no walls blocking it) and  will try  to home in on your current candy-
eating position.  It is  thus  possible  to  block  its progress for a
while, by trapping it behind a wall:

KEY:
| = wall
. = candy
Y = You
F = Fairy

                    || |||||.||.
                    ||  Y....||T
                    ||.|||||.||.

               "The fairy is blocked!"


     The first  level  consists  of  a  one  screen  maze.   The black
passages (technically, I  should  call  them  corridors,  but  I won't
because it sounds too impressive)  in  between  the walls   are filled
with candies which you have to  eat  to progress on to the next level.
The maze layout of the first  level  is remarkably similar to the maze
layout of the second level and all those that come after.  In fact, it
is exactly the same because  there  is  only  one level layout for the
whole game, the only difference  between  levels  is  the speed of the
toothfairy, which increases with each level as it gets angrier, seeing
you blatantly eating candies.  Maybe the toothfairy is your mum.

     The 16 colour graphics (see screen shot) are possibly the worst I
have ever seen, including 'Caveman'  on  the Spectrum.  So much effort
has obviously not been put into them.   The walls are red blocks, with
an almost invisible orange Gem-fill, colour cycling through them.  The
candies are  grey  and  look  less  edible  than  the  London Marathon
winner's socks and the toothfairy looks,  well, less like a fairy than
a herd of stampeding buffalos.  In short, I could draw better graphics
with my big toe and a faulty Atari mouse.

     Okay, so we've said this could be a Spectrum game (and a poor one
at that) and we've said the graphics  are .. minimal (10 colours?) and
we've said as  a  game,  it's  hardly  new,  innovative,  original and
happening (Pac-Man???!) and  we've  said  the  level designer probably
died after creating one level..  but,  let's  talk about its redeeming
features:

1) It runs on (probably) all  Ataris.   Hmm,  but I can see a negative
aspect to that as well.

2) The High Score table saves,  although  it  is not encrypted and can
thus be tampered with by  people  who  are  sad  enough  to want to be
immortalized forever as the champion of Candyman.

3) It was written in  GFA  basic,  so  the programmer deserves all our
sympathy.

4) The programmer himself says it's a: "lousy game".

5) It is a  quick  way  of  re-living  the  nostalgia of Spectrum days
without having to dig the  old  machine  out  of the cupboard and wait
half an hour for it to load.

6) It is freeware.  And well worth it at that price.

     Finally, I must  mention  the  music,  which  is  one fairly long
sample, looping again and again to  the following words: "And we won't
give up and we  won't  give  in  and  there  is  so  much left to do".
Admittedly, I have heard worse tunes and samples so it could be called
the high point of the game.  But the irony of it must not go unnoticed
because after a few minutes  you're  giving  Candyman  up for good and
consigning it to the trash can.

     Ah well, there you  have  it.   Candyman,  free  for Atari owners
everywhere.  What generous people those Fins are.
