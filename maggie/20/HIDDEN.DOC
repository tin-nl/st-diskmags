Subject: Maggie, SAC Expo, Good News

Greetings from across the pond!

My name is Nick Langdon and I'm one of the officers of the Sacramento
California Atari club known as STAR.

I have a Falcon with 14 megs of RAM, PoweUp2 installed, 2.2 gigs of
hd storage and a CD ROM.  I just saw my first issue of Maggie and
it's wonderful, hat's off to your team!  It ran fine but crashed my
system when I tried to quit.  I was running Geneva in 16 color VGA
mode.  The program is stunning!  You really ought to write a full
featured terminal program for TOS that would scroll THAT fast!  The
animation behind the text is a great effect as well, it's been a long
time since I've seen such a nice product for my machine.

Our club each year hosts an annual Atari Computer show here in
Sacramento (The Captiol of California).  We usually get about 300
people total to the show and this year we have a rather large showing
of developers.  Atari even sent us a Jaguar and lots of games to
raffle off at the show.  It was probably one of their last official
acts.  This year the show will be held on March 23rd.  Allow me to
explain what I meant about Atari.....

Since some of this is non-disclosure I must be vague is spots, but
since you could scoop the press releases in Maggie, you ought to hear
this.  You know Sam Tramiel had a heart attack and hasn't been in the
picture for some time.  In his absence, Jack came back and pulled the
plug on everything.  The Jaguar is going to be sold at the first of
next year after they have released all the games they have developed
for it.  A large U.S. company flew out to Sunnyvale three weeks ago
and bought TOS outright, and the rights to the former Atari Computer.
 A deal was also cut with Digital Research for new GEM versions.

The CEO of the company spoke with me on the phone for nearly an hour
(I called about the SAC Expo not knowing anything about was
happening) and told me everything.  TOS is being completely
re-written as a full 32 bit OS.  Depending on the funding their board
of directors will allocate, there will either be a new full 32 bit
tower machine that he said "would toast a Pentium" or a redesigned 32
bit Falcon.

On the software front, MAJOR software companies have already been
notified about this project (which will include a large U.S.
marketing campaign) and have promised new TOS versions of their
products.  This list includes almost all of the big MIDI developers,
and one VERY large "azure" company.  Can I be more vague an drive my
point home?

Now I know through the years we've heard a lot of drum beating, and
you may take this with a grain of salt if you wish, but it's true.
It will be a little while before they come out and start building it
up, after all, they only just secured the rights and have to start
working on a production line.  Also noted with the state of the art
WEB browser for TOS that they had four developers pounding the keys
over.  Expected to cost $39 U.S. Dollars, they said they'd probably
take a loss on that but it was essantial to sell the machine.  Now
THAT'S integrity!  Also briefly mentioned was limited MAC
compatability for the new machine.

I won't say who it is (it's NOT Toad!) and I would ask that you don't
start houndnig people on the net, in fact please be even more candid
if and when you print snippets of this.  I ask that you not reproduce
this article, especially my name.  You may cloud the facts with a
note about "A Company just purchased Atari's computer line" and
identify it with an annonimous source.

It's an exciting time for us loyalists, and we may even see ourselves
with a more powerful machine that all the wise guys who shout their
heads off over Windoze....

By the way, Atari has merged with a large company called JTS in San
Jose California.  They will basically cease to exist after the merger
is finalized.  Jack T. will have one vote on the board of JTS, but
not a deciding vote.  The company makes ZIP drives and other PC
products.  After they scuttle the Jaguar, there will be no Atari left
at all.

Good luck with Maggie, it's great, and I hope all the great things
going on over here will spread quickly to you PAL users.
