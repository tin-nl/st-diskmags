          ~~ POEMS INSPIRED BY RESERVOIR GODS PRODUCTIONS ~~


Here at Maggie we are strong  believers  in "high art". Honest. We are
cultured sorts who would  much  prefer  to  spend  an evening watching
"Madame Butterfly" than Manchester United. Probably.

Yes, we drink deep on  the  heady  cocktail  of art and literature and
spew out our own results. But  we  are  happy if others come and share
our feast. Yes, dear reader, we are encouraging you to submit poems to
Maggie. Everyone knows that poetry is the new rock 'n' roll, so we are
after a slice of the action.

Our poetry postbag has been quite  literally  full of space for months
now. It is  time  you  filled  it  up.  We  will  kick  off  with some
voluptuous verses inspired by the creations of Falcon coding team "The
Reservoir Gods".


POETRY INSPIRED BY TAUTOLOGY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I tried zoology,
Archeology,
and Biology;
but the only thing for me
was Tautology.

(Prof. Oleg Ologonosky, Oxford University)


Oh Tautology one I'm sorry,
I was an unfaithful lover,
I've been having an affair with Tautology 2,
Your younger brother.

(Traci Swan, Treowen)


INSPIRATION: TAUTOLOGY TWO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The thing I like about a puzzle
is that it gets me into a fuzzle.
When I play I like to guzzle
or else I turn into a wuzzle.

(Sir Tufton Bufton, MP [Con])


Oh Tautology 2,
How much do I love you?
I love you more than Tautology 1,
I love you more than my Ron.
You are everything to me,
I enjoy you more than a cup of tea.

(Mrs. Ron Pugh, Wales)


INSPIRATION: DOUBLE BOBBLE 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ooooh Bubbla Bobbla!
Bibbla Bobbla,
Bubbla Bobbla.
Bubbla Bobbla!

(Sven, Sweden)


You can be Dub!
You can be Dob!
But though you may desire it,
You can't be Bob :(

(Bob Thompson, Tittleshire-on-Lyme)


INSPIRATION: SKY-FALL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blocks! Blocks!
Fall out of the sky!
Blocks! Blocks!
I don't know why!
Blocks! Blocks!
They'll land on you!
Blocks! Blocks!
It's not Tautology 2.

(Mr. & Mrs. M. Turd, Tunbridge Wells)


They
     fall
     out of
the
          sky

They land

     with the help

of your
          hand.

(Mr. S. Pace, Milton Keynes)


INSPIRATION: MAGGIE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The words pour out of the disk
like yolk beaten with egg whisk.
The pictures beam out from the screen
Impressions of games and the demo scene.
The speakers sing out with a tune
I am totally over the moon.

(John Tramp, Bedford)


One was surfing the net one day,
When one shouted Oh Hey!
One had found a mag.
Better than any Tabloid Rag,
So one downloaded the file
And one gave a diplomatic smile,
As one cancelled the subscription
To Delia Smith's Cookery Revelations.

(M Thatcher, Sunnyville Nursing Home)


INSPIRATION: DONKEY KONG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sound of a rolling barrel
is like a tuneless Christmas carol;
it marches down the girders
planning out its murders.
Our hero must jump,
as he desires to pump
the girl Kong has captured
with whom he is enraptured.

(Martin Marrow, The Wirral)

INSPIRATION: GOD PAINT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever I see graphics made with god-paint
I faint
their beauty is astounding
as smooth has created rounding.

(Peter Casso, Florence)

I just love
To pretend I'm God,
As good as Agent T,
As good as Sparehead 3,
With the help of God Paint,
I turn into The Saint.

(Bud T. Chud, (Manager Tesco) Bedford)


INSPIRATION: POWER MOUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Power-Mouse,
In a house,
do-da-do-da-do-da-dum!

(Mr F. Mouse, the hole)

GOD LOAD
~~~~~~~~

When memory is tight
I no longer have to fight
for space
as I have an ace
up my sleeve
to relieve
this difficulty.
It is a utility
called god-load
and it is worth its weight in gold.

(Eddie George, Bank of England)


INSPIRATION: RESERVOIR RIPPER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stalking memory
Like it is stuck in the penitentiary,
The ripper lurks
Doing its works.
Stealing graphics
Is how it gets its kicks.
No one envies the ripper's life,
Packed with interrupt driven strife.
But when it is ready to pounce,
It takes its pictorial trophy on the bounce.

(Mr S. Holmes, 221b Baker street)

INSPIRATION: RESERVOIR PACKER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I look,
But I never see.
I search,
But I never find.
I listen,
But I never hear.
I wait,
But you never arrive.

(Submitted by everyone)


O where art thou God Packer?
Any other packer by the same name,
Could never smell as sweet.

(W. Shakespere, Stratford-Upon-Avon)


INSPIRATION: HYPER-RACING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I love driving really fast,
just after breakfast.
When I brake I hear a satisfying crunch,
just after I've digested my lunch.
I love racing in 3D,
just after I end my tea.
I love the smell of burning rubber,
just after I finish my supper.
I think Hyper-Racing is a treat,
just after I've had something to eat.

(Gerhard Burger)


INSPIRATION: PENGUINS DON'T SHAVE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My name is Derek
and I have been shipwrecked
on the icy wastes
looking for doors to suit my tastes.
I'm searching for the key
that is the reality.
Captivity is the one thing I feared,
as it is proportional to the length of my beard.

(Derek The Penguin, The South Pole)
