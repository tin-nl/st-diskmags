
Another interesting article 'lifted' from the pages of Undercover Mag.. 
Again  as it is a primarily German language publication,  I'm sure  the 
majority  of other diskmag readers won't have seen this one yet,  so we 
thought why not try it in Maggie as well.. - C i H

Heyhoo and welcome back to tnb's ART FACTORY, the hippest and most wanted thang
for grafix-men in this mag. By the way, the Ansi you can see at the top of this
screen was done by me. I think this one's a bit better than the ones by Moondog
in the last mag, which were, to be honest, real shit. (and do not give any com-
ment about this, they were REALLY bad!) But who cares?
 
The main-aim of  this corner is to talk about art and such stuff. In the second
volume of this series I will tell you something about a very interesting theme:
graffities. As you  now, I'm a real fan of graffity. Some month ago, every pic-
ture I painted, was a  graffity. I also took part in the  Fried Bits' GFX-Compo
with such a piece, but it wasn't that great...

But how I  got so  interested on  this theme? Well, about a  year  ago, someone
painted a graffiti  at the wall of our gym. The teachers were  very angry 'bout
this and they tried hardly to find the culpried. In fact,they were not success-
ful, but they  knew that the guy was in the 11th  grade. Some weeks later (in a
very  boring  biology-lesson), I  watched  the  guy  sitting next to me who was
drawing graffities. And  the thing  he painted was  nearly the same like on the
gym's wall! So we  began to  talk about this  graffity-stuff and all  and I was
really excited  of it. Some days later  he introduced the complete AOK-posse to
me. (btw., AOK is  NOT the short  name of this famous insurance company - it is
the short name for Art Of Krime (a great name, don't u think ?)) They  were all
at all about 5 guys, some of them very good, some not.

...and I  recognized, that they  had a special slang for the things, which were
involved by  this graffity-thing. I always  had to ask, what this or that means
and they always told me. So, here's a wordlist of these slang-words. Anybody in
any sprayer-scene on this planet will understand,what is meant by this words...

               (funny !)

most of  these words)), DS (esp.RISK, former Bolek), GRAVE, AMOK and all of the
ZULU-World... Fuckings to all Schablonenpisser (esp.the guy who made the shitty
"Police"-Pieces in my city!) and to ZORRRO who is a  big fat pervert lamebrain.
