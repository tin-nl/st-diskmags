 S o u n d s   t h a t   m a k e   y o u   g o   M m m !   P a r t  II

It's  an  ST demo!  A rare species indeed!  This was first seen at  the 
Symposium event,  and  released thereafter..  Actually,  there do still 
seem  to be signs of life on the ST demo scene,  as at least one  other 
decent production was in pre-production and several effects thought not 
possible,  or  very improbable at least,  were shown on a stock STFM at 
the same event.. I also hear that Ben, formerly of Chaos (Tat being the 
other  half  of that partnership) is still working away on his  own  ST 
demo,  years  after  you might think he would have stopped..  Even Tat, 
Falcon  coder extraordinaire,  felt monetarily moved to try another  ST 
demo himself..

But  this pushes the ball into a side pocket of critique  somewhat,  so 
let us get back to the point..

STMYGM  Part  II,  to  keep the textfile to a  reasonable  length,  was 
produced by Cream, formerly known to ST afictionados as 'Alien Cracking 
Formation' or ACF..  This demo emerged from the depths of semi-finished 
hell on a dusty hard drive,  as Cream were not originally going to take 
this demo any further,  but found out that there was still a demand for 
their work.. So this demo finally emerged in April.. 

STMYGM  (Part II) is another music compilation demo,  a staple of  late 
period  ST  demos..  This demo is a demonstration of how it  should  be 
done,  as a lot of effort in all areas has been put in..  The demo also 
has another payoff in that it is also fully Falcon compatible as well.. 
The  main  demo  actually installs to a bootdisk,  and  autoboots  from 
floppy  in the fashion of many a bygone ST demo..  According to  Cream, 
this  is  the  only  such demo to work on the Falcon,  but  I  seem  to 
remember a Maggie 14 review of 'Crash in Hell' by Abstract,  which also 
boot-loaded  and  worked on both ST's and Falcons..  (Indeed,  had some 
enhanced effects on the Falcon!)

(According  to  Tat,  many  of  the effects shown  in  here  would  use 
techniques particular to each machine..  As an example  the reset demo, 
a very big screen affair,  would have had two totally different ways of 
doing it each for ST and Falcon..  Can anyone in Cream throw some light 
on this?)

You  get  an intro sequence of the many logos and nicely  bopping  Sid-
music school of design.  Some old 'ACF' graphics are used at this point 
along  with many individual hand drawn logos of each of  the  Cream/ACF 
members.. Next up is a series of plasma-rastery silhouette pictures and 
large  text  which is used to mainly convey many  greetings  and  other 
trivial information about the demo..  Not a lot moving around, but very 
well done all the same..
 
Going  on  to  the main demo gives us a new Sid-tune by  Tao,  a  large 
scroller  against an understated and tasteful grey background,  and the 
first  of  many  Agent T graphics in the middle  of  the  screen..  The 
scroller is continuous and mainly tells of the activities of Cream  and 
ACF in the last few years and some details about the people involved in 
making  the demo..  The scroller can be interrupted by the spacebar  to 
take  you  to a very deluxe selection screen for a number of  Tao  Sid-
tunes,  each  with  their  own little graphic which lights up  in  full 
colour  from the grey background as soon as it is selected..  Then back 
to the main scrolly screen once that has been done..

Sound chip tunes are either a matter of love or hate, but if you are in 
the first camp,  then these ones are some of the best ever done for the 
ST!

The  scroller  is  interrupted  by various  changes  to  the  graphics, 
including some very nice fullscreen 32 colour piccies which appear from 
time  to  time  as  the  show goes on..  The  demo  is  slow-paced  and 
(deliberately?)  short on action,  but is pleasant to watch and  listen 
to  if  you don't expect tons of scorching 3-D stuff to  come  bursting 
onto the screen any second now..

Finally,  when  it is apparent that the scrolltext has run its  course, 
you press the reset button, and there is another surprise there, with a 
high quality reset demo which again, works on both ST and Falcon.. This 
is  another final Sid-tune and a very big virtual screen which  scrolls 
slowly up and down with some more luscious graphics (a dragon clutching 
a winged fantasy female high above the ground..) 

And  that  is it..  But before we go,  I will mention two other  little 
programs  that  were  bundled  with the  main  demo,  namely  a  little 
'Minesweeper' game, allegedly "inspired" by the Microsoft offering, but 
much  better  presented than that,  and also another little music  demo 
'Steps',  which  is  a single screen menu,  with several Tao tunes from 
demos  past and present,  including all the music from the famous 'Just 
Buggin'  demo,  and other productions,  this time mixed to a double SID 
player,  and  sounding  even  better than the originals..  This one  is 
recommended if you just want a no fuss menu giving you a quick bash  at 
some very tasty tunes. Menu graphics aren't too bad either, with a tiny 
scroller and channel indicator bars bouncing right at the bottom..
 
Ratings:-

Graphics:-  90% - Some of the best presentation on any ST demo of  some 
excellent pictures..

Sonix:- 92% - Tao SID-tunes excell here.. Some top ziks!

Gee-Whiz:-  85% - Not a great deal of action apparent on  the  surface, 
but  what  is  there  is very well put  together  with  the  underlying 
difficulties  of  making  a  demo to work painlessly  on  both  ST  and 
Falcon to consider.. Can't have been that easy..

Overall:-  89% - An essential item for your collection..  The two other 
little proggies are nicely added value too..
