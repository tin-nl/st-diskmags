       QUOTES OF 1995: JUST WHAT HAVE ALL THESE ATARI DUDES BEEN SAYING?

                (Abstract commenting from the past 364.25 days)


       Maybe it's just the way the stars have been mapped out this year, 
       or  maybe  the world is on the brink of a  triviality  overload.. 
       What  ever the reasoning is,  people in the Atari community  have 
       been  acting in a most weird fashion in recent months.  A  steady 
       increase  in  the  senseless  articles  in  the  diskmag   world, 
       extravagant  Falcon  demos with women doing all these  odd  dance 
       routines  like they were unidentified flying hippies..   Then  of 
       course there is the super-rich PD librarian who looks at  Taunton 
       in a Z to A fashion..

       Perhaps we are the ones who will hold the 'solutions for a  small 
       planet'.  Just  think,  if all the world acted like Atari  freaks 
       there would be no wars,  injustice, violence - just a planet full 
       of nutters who are into having a larf and doing silly things with 
       their computers.  Some might call it civilisation ??

       Anyway, you will never read stranger material than whilst sifting 
       throught Atari disk magazines,  or hear stranger things said  are 
       happy-clappy  little  'conventions'.    Here  are  some  of   the 
       nonsense-style things people have been chatting  about,  arranged 
       for your enjoyment in .. er, no particular order..


       'I  hate reviewing disk magazines because they usually amount  to 
        a summary of what's in them, which is boring as hell to write.'

       Persons  featured in this article cannot be held responsible  for 
       things  that were said in these quotes.  Everyone was drugged  by 
       CIH  when  we visited his residence.  I think  it  was  potassium 
       cyanide,  or something of the sort..   Mixed with some Whizz  and 
       Coffee of coz.  You see we have this cult thing, yeah.  Don't get 
       involved  with the Atari scene if you aren't  already.  It's  not 
       worth the risk.  Chris is like David Koresh,  y'see.  Take us  to 
       your leader..

                        Felice, a future star of sports commentary!?!?
                                          (Kev rolling what exactly??)


          'Vogue looks calm, he must have had a good dump methinks.'

             Yes, there's more from our man with the pretend microphone!

                            
                             'Kev's now out of the toilet, who's next?'

                                       Felice just about wraps it up..
