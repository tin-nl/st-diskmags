
        The Sad case of the Amiga Owner's Missing Marbles.. 

In a week when the government finally owns up to the human  version 
of  'Mad  Cow  Disease',  this revealing missive  appeared  in  the 
letters pages of Computer Trade Weekly..  Some speculation later on 
will  consider  whether  it  is  a  massive  piss-take,   or,  more 
worryingly, a real letter from a deranged/disgruntled Amiga Owner..

          'AMIGA USED IN OBSCURE GRAPHICS CAPACITY SHOCK'

I  must  complain about your criticism of the Amiga and  its  (sic) 
non-existent  place  anywhere.  Allegedly.  I feel it is my duty to 
point  out  that  the  Amiga  plays  a  very  significant  part  of 
everybody's  life.  I do not appreciate my favourite computer (home 
or  otherwise)  being down-rated because of your  mis-knowledge.  I 
have prepared a (very) short list of it's current (important) uses:

*NASA's luna transport vehicles

*Yorkshire Police's infoNET

*Granada Television

*Robocop

*Babylon Five

*SeaQuest

*London Transport Museum (I/A disp)

*Casper

*Disney's Toy Story

*TV adverts

*Computer Graphics Interactive (CGI)

*Sliders

Also, most rendered PC graphics in games are done on the Amiga with 
Lightwave.  And if you question any loyal Amiga user about why they 
like it, you could be there all day.

It  is  answers like "...but we will be happy to change  our  view, 
just  as  soon  as  we  get some evidence  that  the  Amiga  has  a 
significant  role to play in the UK home market.  Or anywhere  else 
for that matter" (Speakeasy reply to 'Amiga hope remains' - CTW Feb 
26th)  that assist in ..."the machine's switch from core format  to 
niche business..."

Without  the  Amiga,  we may never have had  satellite  television, 
which  originated  from ordinary satellites because  of  the  space 
exploration.   Speaking   of   satellites,   what  about  worldwide 
communication??

I  admit  that  PC's (sic) are extremely popular.  This  is  mainly 
because  software  houses  saw  an  opportunity  to  produce  cheap 
software  and  charge hyper-inflated prices for them.  And  they're 
perfectly justified. Spares are cheaper for PC's (sic) too.

Software companies are aware that to publish on the Amiga  requires 
lower prices. So they would lose a fraction of the huge profit they 
make.

Would  this  make  any  difference?  Is it hard  to  produce  Amiga 
versions  of such massive hits like Worms?  Obviously,  Team 17 and 
Ocean don't think so. I tend to agree.

Where did the idea of a graphics chip come from?  The Amiga.  Which 
computer  is  cheap and ready to use without  a  massively  complex 
setup and plugs into a TV without extra cards? The Amiga.

"...CTW  has been accused of being overly harsh on Escom and  Amiga 
Technologies  to  date..."  And I'm not surprised.  The  amount  of 
errors  that is made in spelling,  Punctuation and grammer in  your 
paper  is  directly reflected in your attitude to Amiga.  Bad.  You 
can't even remember to put a full stop at the end of a paragraph.

I request (sort of demand) that you print a LARGE FORMAL APOLOGY in 
the  next issue of CTW as I am sure that Amiga users  and  software 
houses alike would like to see you admitting your mistake.

Yours ungratefully
  Barry Wellington
         Upminster

PS.  My  spelling checker decided that 'overly' is not a word.  But 
that's probably because Digita International forget to include this 
in the dictionary as they knew that you wouldn't use Wordworth, and 
they probably wouldn't like you using it anyway. So there.

CTW replies..

We have published the above letter untouched by CTW hand. After all 
it  may well be an elaborate piss-take at our expense  rather  than 
the pompous semi-literate ramblings of a lunatic,  and we'd hate to 
spoil the joke.

Regarding  our  recent comments about the worrying decline  of  the 
Amiga, Mr Wellington has clearly got us bang to rights.

Sorry,  but  we didn't realise that the machine had played such  an 
important role in the making of SeaQuest and Babylon Five. Clearly, 
that means there's a bright future for the machine - retail will be 
picking up the phone and ordering new stock this very minute, while 
ad  staff  on  Amiga  Format  will be  straight  down  the  pub  to 
celebrate.

Long live the Amiga. And long live NASA's lunar transport vehicles.

(Complaints  about starting a sentence with 'and' will be  ignored. 
It's allowed. And that's the end of it.)

Maggie speculates further..

Upon  a very careful examination of this,  I'm inclined towards the 
elaborate piss-take theory..  I'm also inclined to think that is is 
not  all  made up by one person though,  and may be  the  composite 
gathering of the worst outpourings of geniune Amiga owners stitched 
together by the fed-up editorial staff of CTW into a sort of parody 
of  the  'Ultimate Mad Amiga Owner' which then gets  put  onto  the 
letters page..

Will  they  get  the message to shut up and  accept  their  decline 
gracefully though, I doubt it!!
