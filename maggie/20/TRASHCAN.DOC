Two words: 'David' and 'Mellor'.. enough to put anyone off their pint.

David Mellor IS the football fan's  friend, the caring politician, the
only MP who  understands  the  importance  of  football..  ahhh!  Well
enough of that bollocks.  David Mellor is  a Chelsea fan.  And he is a
little bit  b i a s e d
            b i a s e d
            b i a s e d
            b i a s e d
            b i a s e d
            b i a s e d etc.

I am *completely* unbiased  myself,  so  setting  aside  the fact that
Davey boy looks like he should  be  rolling  around the gutter at 4am,
clutching an empty bottle of  whiskey  and  hoping  to score with that
attractive looking lamp-post.. he is an utter eeeeeeeeeeeeeeediot...

Additional comment:
And apart from inventing  an  interesting  mouth  disease, what has he
ever contributed to the human race anyway?

On Saturday afternoons he is there,  ready to listen to the post-match
reflections of every fan, the  laments  of  what could have been.. and
the tragedies suffered... but sadly, unless  you  are a Chelsea fan he
will not do any of the above...

"This is  your show," he  says  every  week  (in  a pathetic effort to
disguise his 'leanings' and save his flagging job) "this is YOUR show,
YOU choose the agenda, YOU talk about  what  you  want to, it is up to
YOU to call," ... but the  even  sadder  truth  is that he spends more
time saying this than conversing with  any of the bereft, heart-broken
fans who ring up hoping for  a  kind  word  (unless of course they are
Chelsea fans (or women)).  They  are  ruthlessly  cut off because Dave
gets a tad bored  unless  he  is  able  to  talk  about: Chelsea, Ruud
Gullit, Glenn Hoddle, Chelsea, Chelsea,  Ruud  Gullit..  Er, yes Dave,
quite.  Anyway, 606 might be a good deal if you happen to be a Chelsea
fan (the probability of which is something akin to Camelot not being a
bunch  of  tory-arse-licking,  money-grabbing  gits)  and  think  that
chatting  to  David  Mellor  for  half   an  hour  is..  er  the  most
entertaining way of spending good down-the-pub-after-match celebrating
time, but for the majority of normal  people, it is utter shite.  They
get a couple of minutes, during which  Dave tries his best to persuade
them to sod off.

     The most entertaining part of 606,  is  when  people ring up, and
then mysteriously ring off again.   Could  they  be trying to tell the
Mellon something?

     But, by far the best 606 I  ever heard was when Davey GOOFED-UP..
after trying for half an hour to  get rid of a particularly persistent
non-Chelsea fan and finally  succeeding,  'ol  Mel  forgot to turn his
microphone off, so during  the  news,  with  approx.  2 million people
listening, he said: "Yeah, yeah,  I  just  couldn't get the boring old
fart off the line.."  Well, it speaks for itself really doesn't it.

It looks like you are trying to sneak two for the price of one into the 
trashcan..  I  think that most of your animosity is directed at Chelsea 
Fans,  a  particularly well-read and articulate bunch (barp!) For  only 
some  of  the time,  you are having a go at David Mellor,  the diseased 
looking Fat cat Tory politician who still manages to get off with loads 
of  dodgy  women..  I  think  that a man who makes love  in  a  Chelsea 
Football strip,  is a man who is doomed indeed, and I'm sure that there 
is  a secret mechanism of natural justice that will catch up with,  and 
deal harshly with this blobby fellow.. 

But I have to reluctantly say no..

Very reluctantly..

John  Gummer  is still out there..  And he makes Davey boy look like  a 
sex-god by comparison!! 

(Loud  boos  and  chanting of 'you're going to get  your  f*cking  head 
kicked in' by the Chelsea fans in the back row..)


Time for more whinging.. computer related this time..

Have you ever noticed how you can NEVER  get rid of a dodgy disk?  You
do everything possible to disguise it,  you waste your precious labels
(the ones you usually guard with  your life, whining that its because:
you've "only got two  left"),  in  an  effort  to  hold the two halves
together, you spend hours fiddling with the little  springs to try and
get the cover to slid back  properly  but  it won't and eventually you
get pissed off and throw the  bloody  thing at the wall, succeeding in
totally breaking it off.  Then you  despair  and resort to sending the
disk to a total stranger,   having  spend  a  long time marking its 32
very bad sectors and bunging  something  on  it  that just about runs,
hoping that they'll think its okay (well  if  it's got a nice label on
it..) and keep it (as everyone keeps  a  good disk) but of course they
send you the very same disk back with  a letter on it thanking you for
sending them the very nice program and  here is your lovely disk back.
Arf.

[Nick]
I think that there is some kind of Karma principle to the issue of naff 
disks..  What goes around, comes around, or in most peoples cases, what 
goes  around  being decent disks going out (possibly by  mistake?)  and 
what  then  comes around are these examples of mangled  magnetic  media 
used  by your so-called contact hoarding the good disks that  you  sent 
him in the first place.. 

Sending  disks  to  contacts  always  was   an  elaborate  example   of 
psychological warfare by post, rather than snubbing someone, or sending 
a  poo in a sealed jiffy bag,  you would send out a mangled disk with a 
label screaming 'Hot New Wares!  Usually a title of a desirable program 
that hasn't been released or thought of yet..  You then would burst out 
your lungs laughing when you imagined their reactions when they spun up 
that  disk..  Oh if only to be an incredibly minaturised spy camera  on 
their  wall etc!!  They continue the process by returning the offending 
disk  to  you,  so  the end result is that only about 30%  of  mail  is 
genuine,  the  rest  of it is keeping a very long and poor  taste  joke 
going  forever..  Modem  sales  are now through the  roof,  and  postal 
contacts are a dying species..

These  disks  should  go  in the bin,  if only to  spare  everyone  the 
pointless  agony  of  a  joke  that  has  gone  stale  through  tedious 
repetition,  and  out of compassion to our posties who would rather  be 
delaying and losing genuine mail instead!!

(Loud  cheers,  but not from the Jiffybag salesmen..) 


Now I think it's time to moan about COVER disks..

Looking at the English, Atari related (paper) mags, 100% of them (well
there is only one ;)  have  these  hideous  things blighting the front
cover..

     a swift bit of investigative journalism later..

Just think about the economics for  a  minute.. the average disk costs
about 25p, or less if you're buying  them in bulk, the average utility
can be found kicking around on  the  internet for anyone to down-load,
so the approx. price of putting together  your own cover disk would be
25p (assuming of course that you're a  student who spends hours on the
net, as every respectable student  should).   But  evilly, by having a
cover disk, the magazine adds a pound  to its cover price, since Atari
World, sans disque (and now sans everything), was œ3.25 and the one in
question, œ4.25.  And don't forget  that  the  format of the first has
less pages than the whole world of the second..  ouch!

If there was some decent stuff on the cover disk, we couldn't complain
too much, but they haven't even had one Falcon specific program on yet
and things such as  Jumble-Up,  Wordfind,  Breakout  and other *great*
programs, most of which have  already  featured  on  about five of the
previous cover disks, are not exactly  the cutting edge of programming
greatness today..

So basically, cover disks are an  excuse  for  putting the price of an
already expensive mag UP and chopping  a  few  pages off the back - oh
yes and they are a good way of filling up the back page without having
to find an advertiser.  Instead  they  'advertise' the cover disk with
some truly dreadful screen shots and a 'Guarantee of Quality' logo.  I
think a 'Guarantee of Arse' would be more appropriate.

[Nick]
Magazine  cover  disks  are a revealing barometer  of  the  health,  or 
otherwise,  of a computer scene..  In the glory days of ST Format,  you 
had  a sprinkling of the small and insignificant to be sure,  but there 
were  also  some  thumping great demos of commercial  games  and  other 
useful  software  as  well..  Now,  you get the odd gem on  there,  but 
everything else is mostly bobbins..  With reference to Falcon users, in 
the  specific  context of the remaining UK magazine,  I think  that  ST 
Format's  own policy is too restrictive,  as they consider Falcon users 
to  be  too small a miniority..  What is up guys,  just the odd  little 
Falcon  specific file on the cover disk would be nice,  and it wouldn't 
detract  from  the  rest  of the ST community with  a  bit  of  careful 
planning..  As  it is,  we get too much stuff that says "Not TOS 2.06", 
which means "And you Falcon owners with fancy ideas can get knotted  as 
well!"

For that reason especially, these should go in the bin!!

(Very  loud  cheers,  a  glum  Nick Peers tries to force  a  smile  but 
fails..)


Computer dictionaries that don't recognise the word: arse.
Go on, try it at home.
Aren't they aware it's a  word  which acutely illustrates and embodies
the personality, wit, charm and intelligence of David Mellor?

[Nick]
A computer dictionary that fails to recognise the word 'arse' implies a 
sublime  ignorance  on the part of its creators..  Would you  prefer  a 
dictionary that was all too aware of the existence of the word  'arse', 
and  possibly  other  rude words too,  and reported you  to  the  Daily 
Express  funded  Polite Language Police if your document  was  littered 
with  them..  No,  we  don't  want  Big Brother (or Big Bill!)  on  our 
systems..  Anyway,  why  can't they come up with a dictionary that auto 
corrects 'teh's' in realtime as you misspell them!!

Now *that* would be a boon to a hard pressed Maggie editor!!
 
It's not going in, sorreee!!

(Silenced bafflement from audience who not know what the hell he was on 
about just then..)
 

Men who complain  about  'women  drivers'  and  how  they shouldn't be
allowed to drive because they are 'incapable' and should let 'a MAN do
it for them.'

These are the sort of guys who would  drive into a parked car and then
try to drive off without  stopping  so  that they wouldn't sully their
'perfect' driving record.  Of course,  since  God  is very quick these
days (and is also a woman) these people rarely get away...

How they can  justify  their  archaic  views,  I  have  no  idea.  The
majority of accidents are  caused,  not  by  women, (or console-crazed
kids or joyriders  or  pornography,  or  tesco-incensed customers from
Bedford) but by blokes trying to break  the land speed record in their
Manta and  unfortunately  getting  distracted  by  the  blonde  in the
convertible, or trying to overtake the bloke in the convertible.

These people are living in the cretaceous period, they are the sort of
fossilized guys who  would  expect  their  wife  to  iron their beige-
coloured trousers, cook them  large  joints  from Delia Smith's winter
collection, wash their Y-fronts and bring   their copy of the Express,
slippers and foot-rug to their armchair  and  then  go off and do some
knitting.  If they ever do manage  to  get  a female so drunk that she
agrees to marry  them,  (which  is  about  as  likely  as  Jesus being
reincarnated as a carpet  fitter  called  Ron)  then  they will have a
crash-course in living (and dying) in the twentieth century..

     Once sober, their partner  for  life  would  probably murder them
with the joint knife, burn the house  down with the petrol coated copy
of the Express  and  make  a  getaway  with  the Ferrari, cheque-book,
credit cards, forged signature, bank account numbers,  etc. etc.

[Nick]
I'm  not at all sure that this one should go in as you have managed  to 
identify a species that is already knocking at the door of extinction.. 
You  mention  the cretaceous period,  a long distant time  where  beige 
coloured trousers and indeed, tank tops ruled.. The sort of distant era 
which had nightly showings of 'Terry and June' on the box, until we all 
cried no more!! Since then, a stiff corrective to that kind of thinking 
in the form of feminism has arrived on the scene.. Anybody who wants to 
go on about 'Bloody Women drivers' now has to do it in hushed  whispers 
or suffer the consequences..

If such a creature is still lumbering around with his outdated  notions 
on women drivers,  and indeed,  the world in general, I'm sure that the 
'little woman' in the equation can more than cope these days.. Hours of 
self  improvement classes,  combined with a handy car servicing  manual 
can  enable her to alter the handling and braking characteristics of  a 
car,  so  that  dear  reactionary hubby who insists  on  spouting  such 
rubbish soon finds himself attempting to break the 'going over a cliff' 
speed record,  end result, mangled car, mangled hubby, and cash in the 
life insurance policy thank you very much..

Anyway,  they  can't  go in,  whilst the real menace on our roads,  taxi 
drivers, remain out there!!

(High pitched feminine booing, middle aged men in the audience walk out 
in disgust anyway..)


Aptiva adverts REALLY piss me off..
They are so hideously obviously  trying  to  disguise  a mundane PC by
changing its name and personifying it, almost to the extent that it is
presented as an addition to  the  family.   By Christmas, they'll have
indoctrinated the public  so  much  that  Aunt  Lucy  will be offering
Aptiva a slice of cake and some mulled  wine and trying to ram it down
the disk drive.  A range of  clothes  will  be brought out for Aptiva,
monitor mufflers, keyboard comforters etc. and  Aptiva will be the big
brother/sister of all those lonely only children out there who have no
friends... ahh!

But I believe the campaign  will  backfire as Aptiva's attributes will
cause a rift in otherwise happy marriages:  "Janice, I'm leaving you!"
"But why Hugo, what have I  done?"   "Because you won't multitask like
Aptiva does!"

Oh well, she can always take  a  sledgehammer to Appy, who isn't quite
yet proficient in self defence.  Ciao.

[Nick]
Yes,  and they don't tell you that the whole sad shooting match will be 
totally out of date by next Christmas, and you'll have to fork out even 
more  money  to keep it up to spec..  Aptiva is like a big  brother  or 
sister,  but  probably  twice as costly..  At least children do provide 
some  sort  of deep satisfaction and fulfilment,  but the pseudo  child 
Aptiva  just  sits  there,  a great sulking lump of glass  and  plastic 
babbling its idiot noises out of its tinny speakers..

It  was  all the fault of Commodore,  back in the olden days when  they 
first started the idea of 'cute' in computers.  with the Commodore Pet, 
an  ugly  rottweiler of a machine..  Various sad attempts at  softening 
what  is basically an inanimate lump of plastic have followed down  the 
ages,   until   you   now  get  the  most  uncute  of  computers,   the 
Intel/Microsoft  PC..   Now  if  sales  and  marketing  gurus  were  to 
acknowledge a basic truth,  that these machines are *not* cuddly,  that 
they are red-clawed and snarling with system bugs and archaic operating 
system leftovers,  and reflected that in their marketing, I'm sure that 
people would be happier, or appropriately miserable in any case.. Names 
such as the XR Bastard Series 3,  the MicroSystems Shitbag, or the Dell 
Tosser would set the right tone..

Instead,  we  get a name that not even the naffest of executive  luxury 
saloon cars would stomach, so Apteeeeva it is..

You  need  a really whiny bored voice to get the full  nuances  of  the 
pronunciation of that accursed name..

Apteee-va, now say it after me..

Ok,  this  one  goes  in,  for  all the PC's dressed up  as  fake  home 
computers, for which crap 'edutainment' software is sold.. 
      
(Loud cheers, and sounds of monitors crunching underfoot..)

Well done Ripley,  you managed to get bad disks, ST Format cover disks, 
and the Aptiva PC into the trashcan!! 

However, you are taking home with you the complete Chelsea away kit and 
also  some garlic to ward off possible nocturnal visitations  by  David 
Mellor, a big placard with the word 'arse' written on it to put next to 
your computer,  and a whole glove compartment from a 1973 Mark III Ford 
Cortina, as originally seen in episode four of the Sweeney..

Goodnight!
