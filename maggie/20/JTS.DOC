

          ATARI CORPORATION AND JTS CORPORATION TO MERGE

Otherwise known as Atari give it up..
                         admit defeat..
                         flush themselves away..

Not a lot of the news that came out in the early part of 1996 was good, 
we suffered the closing down of Atari World (reported elsewhere) a  lot 
of people seem to be wavering badly, and now this.. 

It does not really make too much difference to the rest of us, as Atari 
ceased  to  be on the case years ago..  Perhaps it was inevitable  when 
Atari  had the likes of the PlayStation to compete against,  but it  is 
kind of a shame nevertheless..

Of  the  hardware,  the Jaguar seems to be in for a period  of  gradual 
rundown  and selling off of cheap stock..  If you have always wanted  a 
Jag  to play particular games that appeal to you,  then now is a really 
good time to buy.. You may not see them again in a year or so..

Of  the  TOS based computing heritage,  something more  intriguing  may 
happen..  An  interested party has reportedly got hold of the rights to 
develop and manufacture any future TOS-based machines and may do so.. I 
cannot  say any more as the information I've got is limited  and  under 
a  heavy burden of non-disclosure in any case..  If these plans do come 
off, then things could suddenly get very interesting..

If on the other hand however...

Just wait and see..

On  February 13, 1996,  Atari  Corporation  and JTS Corporation announced
plans to merge the two  companies.   JTS  is  a  manufacturer of personal
computer hard disk  drives.   "This merger puts us in a great position to
capitalize  an   a  very    experienced  management  team  and  a rapidly
growing disk   drive   market.  JTS   is   using   innovative technology,
particularly  in  the  3"  disk  drive  market,  and we are excited about
its prospects," said  Jack  Tramiel,  Chairman  of   Atari.    Under  the
terms of the agreement, the   new   corporation  will operate  under  the
name of JTS Corporation  and  the   officers   of   JTS  will become  the
officers of the merged company.  The Atari entertainment business and the
JTS disk drive business will  operate  as  separate  divisions of the new
merged company.

In  connection with the merger Atari has extended a bridge loan to JTS in
the amount of  $25  million.   In  the  event  that  the   merger  is not
consummated, the bridge loan may be convertible into shares of JTS Series
A Preferred Stock at the option  of  Atari  or JTS and subject to certain
conditions.

As   a   result   of  the   transaction,  Atari  stockholders  will  hold
approximately  60%   of  the  outstanding  shares  of  the  new   company
following the merger.  The transaction is structured to qualify as a tax-
free reorganization and will be accounted for as a purchase.

The  boards of directors of  Atari  and  JTS have approved the definitive
merger agreement.   The  merger  is  subject to  certain shareholder  and
regulatory  approvals   and   other   conditions   to  closing.   It   is
anticipated  that  the transaction  will    close  toward  the end of the
second  calendar  quarter  of 1996.

Atari  Corporation  markets  Jaguar,  the  only  American made,  advanced
64-bit entertainment  system,  and   licenses  and  markets  software  in
the  multi-platform, multimedia market.   Atari  is located in Sunnyvale,
California.

The above statements regarding the disk drive industry and JTS' prospects
are forward  looking  statements  and  involve  a   number  of  risks and
uncertainties.

Among  the  factors that would cause  actual results to differ materially
are the  following:  business  conditions  and  growth in   the  portable
computer industry   and  in  the  general  economy;  competitive factors,
including  pricing pressures;   availability   of  components  from third
parties; risks  associated with  manufacturing  of  products  in India or
other overseas jurisdictions   and risks   associated  with  JTS' ability
to ramp its  manufacturing  operations, including cost and yield issues.

Atari takeover, some more comments..

It  had  been rumoured for months that *something* drastic was  going  to 
happen  to  our favourite product design and engineering wizards  with  a 
shite  marketing department..  Ever since they offed a load of  employees 
and  third party developers at around Xmas time..  Some rumours suggested 
the  company was on the point of closing down altogether,  others that  a 
buyout was imminent.. Now,in the early part of February, the news finally
broke!

As an interesting postscript to all of the above,  Jack (very senior dad) 
Tramiel  is reported by some (ST Format) to have reaccquired day  to  day 
control  of Atari from his son Sam,  as the latter is suffering from some 
unspecified  'heart  condition..'  Other,  and  more  likely  speculation 
suggests  that Jack simply got fed up with the way things were going  and 
re-entered the fray.. Kinda ironic, as Jack took over Atari to originally 
set  it  up  as his own family business,  with his sons as the  board  of 
directors..  People with very long memories will recall that Jack Tramiel 
left  Commodore back in 1985 as they would not allow him to  appoint  his 
sons onto the management there!!   He then approached Warner to buy Atari 
from them for just that purpose, and the rest is history, as they say..
