Death comes to us all.  For some it comes sooner rather than later,  and 
whereas  most of us would probably like to go peacefully when we're  old 
and  wrinkled  having  led a long and fulfilled life,  others  are  less 
fortunate.  Making  Death's acquaintance in more bizarre ways when  they 
were least expecting it to happen.

The "Fortean Times",  respected (and totally unheard of, by me at least) 
magazine  chronicles strange phenomena covering the whole spectrum  from 
UFOs,  Bigfoot,  and visions of the Virgin Mary to weird tales and human 
oddities.  Somewhere amongst this lot are 'Strange Deaths' and this book 
is a collection of fully documented tales of those poor unfortunate sods 
who  died  in the most bizarre,  tragic,  comic,  freakish or down right 
unlucky ways.

Just as an example of some of the stuff to expect in this book, here are 
a few of my favourite extracts:

"Carried  off  in  the act,  but this time both together,  were  married 
couple Sachi and Tomio Hidaka of Chiba.  Japan.  Both 34, the shy couple 
had waited 14 years before making love for the first time,  in 1992.  It 
proved  too  much,  and  both of them died of  heart  attacks,  although 
neither had any history of heart trouble."

"In New Orleans more than 100 lifeguards threw a party in April 1992, to 
celebrate  their first ever year without tragedy.  While they were  busy 
partying,  one  of  the guests,  who was not a life-saver,  fell into the 
swimming  pool fully-clothed and drowned...  even though four lifeguards 
were supposed to be on duty at the time."

"A  naked  man  running across New York's Brooklyn Bridge  in  May  1993 
singing  "Oh  what  a  beautiful morning!" was run over  by  a  car  and 
killed."

"...  in October 1992 California health inspectors carried out a routine 
check  on a fast-food diner in Los Angeles,  and found two human corpses 
in the deep freeze.  They were owner Lydia Katash and her lover, who had 
been strangled at least eight months previously.  Astonishingly,  no one 
had  found  them  before the inspection.  Police arrested  Katash's  ex-
husband  and partner in the business,  but health inspectors were unable 
to  close down the restaurant.  If they had founds rats or  cockroaches, 
closure  would have been instant;  but there's nothing in California law 
to prevent human bodies being stored next to food."

"In December 1976 Sam Davidovitch,  60, sipped a glass of wine and asked 
the  band to play his favourite song in a restaurant in Tel Aviv.  "This 
is  how I want to die," he said,  "with a glass of wine in my hand while 
the band plays my tune." Then he got up to dance with his wife, sang the 
words... and dropped dead of a heart attack."

And there's plenty more like that.

You'd  think that the rather macabre nature of the subject matter  would 
not  exactly have you laughing to yourself.  But it it does.  Especially 
the  more bizarre and ironic accounts.  If not you will probably put  it 
down  feeling rather sober and depressed and thinking,  "It could happen 
to  me".  It would probably be very unfortunate if you died reading this 
book because you'd be guaranteed to make it into the next edition with a 
special  section  all  to yourself.  I can think of better  ways  to  be 
immortalized.

R.I.P. Read In Peace.
