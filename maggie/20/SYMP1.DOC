   (Otherwise known as the Symposium event - 5th to 8th April 1996)

..The Thursday after..

Looking  back on all of this,  I think a more appropriate angle on  this 
should  be something like 'How much can a Human body take?!'  The  whole 
event  and the journey there and back had this unreal quality to it,  as 
though we were inhabiting someone else's body for the trip.. However, my 
battered feet reminded me just where they had been after I got back,  as 
they   swelled   up  and  ached  abominably,   only  fading   out   when 
unconciousness quickly came..

Anyway, the bit you are reading next was the bit that I wrote before the 
trip was undertaken..

..Preamble bit..

Symposium..  Sim-pose-e-um..  An  event consisting of an amalgamation of 
the former famous Fried Bits Falcon convention,  and several others of a 
PC, Amiga, and even Commodore 64 bent.. With the odd Archimedes propping 
open the fire exit doors no doubt..  This year,  thanks to the fact that 
we were able to organise ourselves a tad earlier than three weeks before 
the event, we are going!! That is, firm attendances by me (CiH and maybe 
a couple of spare alter-egos?),  Felice,  Leon 'Mr Pink', Tat of Digital 
Chaos,  and  even Mike Noyce and Kev Davies who have been known to write 
the  odd entertaining thing for us too..  Truly a major invasion of  the 
Maggie  team  kind..  Some others who we would have liked very  much  to 
attend as well, sadly won't be, but more of them in a little while..

This  is  three  days before we set off (on  Thursday  4th  April)  and 
tension is building nicely.. I'm stocking up on sleep and baths, things 
which will be a very rare luxury at the event..  ZzzzzZZZ! (Nap attack) 
I  hate to think what the state of my skin/mind is going to be  at  the 
end of it all, ah well..

  ZzzZZZ Glub! - Nap attack in a bath.. Not recommended..

Well I've been ready to go since I got my new passport three weeks ago.. 
What a puny document it is too.. I am ancient enough to remember the old 
style  black  British passport.  Now that was a passport (brandishes  it 
like  a dagger..) Now we are in Europe,  a future that seems to be small 
and maroon coloured..

Other  people  were going to come,  but have dropped out..  Kev  Dempsey 
(Sparehead  3)  'cos he cannot get the time off from work..  RiCH  Davey 
bacause  of  a  cockup  in his finances,  Tronic,  because of  the  same 
reason.. Well you don't know what you are missing (Kev does!)

Whilst  we  are  here,  better  do  some of these  in  a  fit  of  light 
pisstaking..  Maybe  one to get Mike Noyce to do more of on any realtime 
article that may be running? Cow shape warning..

Well that wasn't too difficult..

Now we can have these mysterious occult ASCII shapes all over the place, 
Falcons,  PCs,  Amigas,  now no one is safe!!  Ha ha hahaha!!  (Aleister 
Crowley the third..)

Things to do.. Get German folding stuff from bank.. Get Commodore 64 SID 
music PC demo from Dave and Mark on Wednesday.. Did you know that we are 
hopefully  meeting Rich Karsmakers on the way back,  and he asked for  a 
copy  of  this..  PC demo??  Sounds like a partial sellout to me!  I say 
*hopefully*  meeting  Rich  K,  as  the coach times  don't  seem  to  be 
particularly  stable,  and  everyone seems to have a slightly  different 
version of events with their ticket.. We may have to rush the coach as a 
mob to all get on the same one in the first place! Fun fun fun..

Headache tablets????? The more the better!

Got to catch some Z's now.. See you later..

                            ----------------
Now two days to go..

Right,  I  managed  to  get  my  hands on  some  German  folding  stuff, 
practically  cleaning  out the travel agents small stock of cash  to  do 
so..  I spoke to Leon last night as well.. He is finishing his 'Skyfall' 
game  for the Falcon,  just really a massive bughunt,  and he may end up 
using Tat's Falcon at the show to finish the game??

Leon does not know as yet of our little 'surprise' Tat and I are  laying 
on for him.. To briefly explain, some of the Maggie party Expose grabbed 
mug shots have been sent to Tat to play around with..  They happen to be 
Kev and Leon's pictures respectively.. I've got a feeling that Kev might 
get  off  lightly  this time,  but Tat is having all sorts of  fun  with 
Leon..  One  version  of the picture has Leon 'touched up' with  bulging 
comedy  eyeballs  (by  me!) and looks gross!!  Tat may  well  produce  a 
distorter,  with  user-definable  distort options of different parts  of 
Leon's face, if I heard him correctly that is?!

In  the meantime,  a dodgy Apex .FLH animation on similar lines has also 
been made as a standby in case Tat does not get anything finished.. This 
will definitely go to the show!!

Gotta do some last minute laundry for clean clothes to wear,  and also a 
bit more Maggie stuff (Interview with Tony Greenwood maybe..)

More despatches from the keyboard tomorrow, seeyaall!!

                            ----------------
Okay then, the last day before we set off!!

I  got (and made) several phone calls from the party goers tonight,  all 
of which were inconclusive "See you tomorrow" type calls.. it looks like 
a  lot  of waiting around as nobody is taking a chance with  the  trains 
tomorrow and will be getting to Victoria Coach Station really early..

Tat  has managed to produce his Leon morphing demo and reckons that  one 
frame looks like the Spitting Image version of Quentin Tarantino!

Leon  has virtually finished Skyfall,  and an (almost) debugged  version 
will be released at the party..

Felice  is  taking his camcorder..  More gruesome mugshots for the  next 
issue of Maggie!!

I'm taking my airbed as I don't fancy sleeping on the floor..

My  bag  has  packed surprisingly easily..  Have I  forgotten  something 
vital??

That's it for now.. See you after the party..

                            ----------------

..Party Report starts here..

Another  thing you may like to know,  that like the Maggie party,  there 
was a realtime article produced..  No, not just the Diskbusters Realtime 
article,  a  Fried Bits/Symposium tradition,  but one written on pen and 
paper  by ourselves,  which sort of came from nowhere,  or Tat's pad and 
paper to be totally precise..  Like the Maggie party review, this report 
will  be intercut with choice bits of realtime article,  until it is all 
used up.. So there..

Thursday 4th April, 7.30 am (GMT) (DAY ONE)

A  faint wafting of Radio Four in a news and currenty  affairs  attitude 
waves away the sleep from your narrator..  I stay glued to the bed until 
7.39 when I finally convince me to get up,  as doing the breakfast thing 
might be quite a good idea..  As things turn out over the next 36 hours, 
it later transpires that it is a very very good idea indeed..

8.20am..  Start  the  drive  to Felice's place twenty miles away  in  St 
Neots,  where  we are to meet and travel to the railway station for  the 
train  to  London..  A momentary fit of false paranoia has me turn  back 
home  whilst still embattled in Rushden morning traffic,  but I did  not 
forget anything after all.. About ten minutes added to the journey, nice 
one!!

Shortly after 9am..  Arrive at Felice's place, dodging past a JCB digger 
and several men laying a new pavement,  park car, nervously wondering if 
it  is  going  to become part of the building  works  going  on  nearby, 
remember  that double bank holiday of Good Friday and Easter Monday  are 
to  follow after today,  and figure out that my car will probably be  ok 
after all,  smile.. Felice is waiting in his hallway with two large bags 
packed  and ready to go..  Our taxi is due at 9.30 which still gives  us 
time to view the Symposium Invite intro, very nice it is too.. 

The Taxi is a little late and we overhear cursing on the intercom as  it 
transpires  that this car is a different one from the one  allocated  to 
pick us up, the previous driver having gotten a little bit lost..

10.05am..  St  Neots  railway  station,  an undistinguised waiting  room 
smelling of tramps wee is vacated as Maggie Team and several middle-aged 
American Women board the train for London.. American Women are unsure if 
we have invaded first class carriage until Maggie Editor points out that 
first  class accomodations can only be distinguished from  second  class 
seating  by the fact that first class has cigar,  rather than  cigarette 
burns on the carpet.. 

An  hour  later..  Get off at Finsbury Park,  a small station near Kings 
Cross..  Travel  on  London  Underground  Victoria Line  on  dodgy  non-
underground  travelling  British Rail/Network  Southeast  tickets  which 
Felice think are ok, probably.. Maggie editor starts to sweat a bit.. 

Arrive  at  London  Victoria..  Tickets NOT ok after all,  but  friendly 
station  official accepts our garbled explanation and lets us out  after 
paying the normal fare..  We wait awhile at Victoria,  hoping to pick up 
some  other party visitors,  after trips to W.H.Smith to stock up on the 
new issues of 'Viz Magazine' and 'Private Eye',  visits to the Bureau de 
Change  to convert the last of my cash to Deutschmarks,  and some  quick 
sidestepping  to  avoid the woman trying to sell  us  'lucky  heather'.. 
Eventually give up waiting here as a bad job, and decide to do some more 
concentrated waiting at Victoria Coach Station instead..

After some initially faulty signposted directions which nearly put us on 
to  the platform for the 12.20 for Ruislip,  we reach the coach  station 
after  a reasonable walk ('reasonable' without bags and  suitcases  that 
is..)  The entrance foyer contains a waiting Tat who is  guarding  Leons 
bags as well..  Leon (Mr Pink) turns up shortly after with the news that 
the  toilets here cost an extortionate twenty pence to use..  Resolve to 
hold  on to bladder until we reach the Cross Channel Ferry..  We are  to 
meet  Mike Noyce,  Kev 'Taffy' Davies,  and another Falcon person called 
Neil (Rodway-Jones),  sometimes signed as Arnel in the realtime, who was 
been  in touch with Tat through the IRC,  but not met in person as yet.. 
We move to the waiting area for the coach, and happily find all of these 
people there already waiting..

Long  wait  ensues until coach puts its face around the  corner..  Large 
numbers of Danish students pile up erratically in the waiting area, with 
odd  shaped packages and guitars tied up with string..  Eurolines (Hell-
Coaches  Incorporated) checking-in desk remains closed  and  shuttered.. 

We  stand  absently on one leg for a while until  the  check-in  counter 
opens..  After a while, we are let through reluctantly, and wait for the 
coach  which is sat sullenly in the station with an 'I've  broken  down' 
expression  written  all  over it..  Maggie Editor goes to stock  up  on 
(very)  large chocolate bar,  sandwiches (eaten 0.00065 seconds  later, 
and  bottle of coke (drunk in various places on and off the coach.)  The 
coach arrives, unbroken down at last, and a mad panic to get luggage and 
bodies on ensues..  We don't end up all together, but in a group of four 
(Me,  Leon,  Felice and Neil),  Kev Davies and Mike Noyce together,  and 
poor old Tat all on his own!

About 3.30pm GMT.. Coach sets off at last, hurrah!

It  is quite a warm day,  especially in the greenhouse-like interior  of 
the upper deck of the coach.. The driver, fresh from loading the luggage 
sounds  like he is on the edge of a heart attack as he  announces  where 
the coach is going..  Breath, pause, speech, breath, pause, speech etc.. 
I  am sharing the seat with a Swedish Student who is mostly asleep,  but 
pass the time talking to Neil sitting just across the aisle..  Also Leon 
and  Felice  join  in..  The coach moves very slowly across  a  traffic-
stuffed London, and we wonder if we will ever make the Symposium.. 

No  worries  as  we make good time to Dover,  the coach wanders  in  the 
direction of the ferry boarding point,  and after a tense ten or fifteen 
minutes,  up  the ramp we go!  A quick dash for (free!) toilets follows, 
then the slower and more considered search for the bar..  Several drinks 
later (one per team member only!) and we are sitting comfortably for the 
first,  and probably only time on the trip.. Then the ferry lurches away 
from  the  quay,  we  kiss goodbye to good old Dover and  British  soil, 
facing  the  uncertainties of the next few days properly for  the  first 
time..

A  pad  of  paper makes an appearance,  courtesy of Tat,  and  having  a 
reputation for this sort of thing,  yours truly is appointed guardian of 
the  Maggie Symposium Realtime Article,  and the first entries are  made 
about this time..

Ferry Tales..

6.20pm GMT - 4.4.96.

CiH at the keyboard, erm, paper here as we lurch across the channel..

Ferries  are really brilliant,  like being drunk without the expense  as 
the deck pitches and topples beneath your feet..

So  far  we  are undergoing a coach journey of a  Scandinavian  kind  as 
several Swedish students pack out the very small space..

Handing over now to Rizla Man - Leon?


Mr Pink takes over the keys.... Or pen as the case may be. This ferry is 
undulating  in  a  quite annoying manner and the  guinness  is  swilling 
around  my  stomach.  Tat  has  already taken the  first  photo  of  the 
gathering but missed Chris's 'Freak at the window' cameo. Shame. Time to 
pass the paper round.


Mike N. Heave ho - I hope not. The old ferry is going up and down rather 
a lot.  Sea on one side,  sky, worryingly, on the other. Europe, here we 
come.


Mr Pink has left the building! SPLUSH!! - CiH


6.30pm GMT..

We just hit something??  How do you hit something on a ferry?? Is this a 
cobbled sea??? -CiH


Felice now on but no mention of you know who?  Still,  a good ferry ride 
so far. Mr Pink has warned me not to fart in the coach like I did in the 
mens room just now.


Mike N. CiH has left the building. - To be sick no doubt (grin!)
 -(naa! - ED)


Arnel feels a little icky.....


Taffy  here..  I am not liking the sea-type motion at all and feel quite 
ill, I should not have eaten the "MEXICAN CHILLIED CHICKEN!"

Everyone has gone for a chocolate fix.


Mr Pink is drinking his pint!


6.40pm GMT..

CiH  at the controls here - we went to a duty free/sweetshop place,  and 
apart from an impressive Toblerone bar (hang on, just ran over some more 
mid-ocean  cobbles?)  The sweet counter was a vision from  travel  sweet 
hell, still, I got my big bar of chocolate in earlier..

 ha                  t              hi        ?
W  t's     ron      i h    T  s    S  p   T  n 
          W   g    W        hi             he

Seems fine to me Tat, maybe your balance is going?? - CiH


   uopjed

*NB. Turn your monitor or head upside down now!*



Shall we hijack this boat and ask them to drive it to Hamburg? - CiH

Fair point,  but we don't really want the ferry journey to be any longer 
than it already is - Mr Pink..

Why not, it's better than 90% of illegal drugs! - CiH

Apart from speed, speed rules! - Mr Pink

"They  told  me  how good it could make me feel  (Ferry),  but  not  how 
BAD!!!" - Taff

Stop whingeing boy, you'll enjoy it more if you stop throwing up! Felice 
has gone 'upstairs', if he falls off, maybe I get to keep his camcorder? 
- CiH  (Ho ho ho, 'ferry funny)

10 points for Pushing Felice off! - Mr Pink

Word of the trip: 'CONDIMENTS' (or beef??)
Sign of the trip: 'Please unplug the charging leads 
BEFORE launching the lifeboat???? - Tat

6.55pm GMT..

Taff has turned into a Texas Instruments programmable calculator saddo - 
showing off his ability to make pointlessly pretty sine wave patterns on 
the overlarge and chunky LCD display - Why?/ - CiH

LATTICE C in the urinals 
- Mr Pink

Yes, what is it we said about drugs Leon?? - CiH

Sod it,  I do not know the time,  but this is getting serial (kind of) - 
Taff


The thing about the boat Race is..
Wait for it..
It's always the same 2 teams in the final! - Boom Boom! - Mr Pink


7.00pm GMT..
 
Sorry about that folks, aha, Felice + Mike have returned covered in salt 
and spray and sea shanties.. - CiH

It does get better later, honest!

The  ferry  turns out to be one of the best bits of the  trip,  time  to 
stretch out,  relax,  wander around a bit.. Wander around very carefully 
as  the  floor does not seem to be in quite the same place  twice..  Try 
going  'outside' where a howling gale (thanks to the forward  motion  of 
the  ship)  is  blowing..  The evening sky has a  lovely  misty  effect, 
nothing else is visible,  apart from a few lonely sounding seagulls, and 
the distant smudged shape of another ferry ahead of us..

About  fifteen minutes towards the end,  we congregate in the bowels  of 
the ship,  in the stairwell by the car decks until a crew member lets us 
in and onto the coach again..

Coach starts and lurches forward,  expectantly paused on the ramp of the 
ferry,  our incipient coronary patient of a driver stalls the thing!  He 
manages to knock the intercom 'on', so we are treated to a resume of him 
trying to get out of the mess, keys jangle until we wonder just how many 
keys he brought with him, cries of 'Oh no!' (with worse ones kept out of 
reach no doubt?) - Very entertaining it is too,  but he eventually finds 
the  right  key  and  roars off the ramp  to  the  relief  of  everybody 
concerned.. Long way for an RAC patrolman to swim otherwise!

(Now 8.30 Central European Time - CET - all times given from now are CET 
unless stated otherwise..)

The  journey  proper  starts as we whisk  through  a  rapidly  darkening 
Calais,  the  video screens switch on and we are treated to nothing less 
than  Four  Weddings and a Funeral - with Danish subtitles!!!  Yes  even 
*that*  bit  at the beginning,  where Hugh 'suck me harder' Grant is  in 
full four letter word flow..  (More on that in the next realtime bit..)

'Four  Weddings' is a film that is remarkably good if you don't pay  too 
much close attention to it,  watching it in an abstract 'keeping up with 
the general flow' sort of way..  We pass all the way into Belgium,  some 
members of the party attempt a light doze,  Mr Pink being voted the best 
sleeper of the trip..

The film finishes, and we are booted off the coach for half an hour into 
the  crisp  night  air  whilst several of the  seats  are  converted  to 
sleeping  couchette  things,  and get to try out Belgian garage  toilets 
striding past the queue of waiting tooth-brushers..  Refreshed and drunk 
of  Belgian  garage water,  Felice and I spot the other members  of  the 
party sizing up a nearby clump of trees as a toilet facility..

Back on the coach,  discover that some of the seats grabbed for sleeping 
accomodation  are  ours,  so scramble for alternative place to park  our 
bottoms  on..  I end up next to Mike Noyce for the rest of the journey.. 
Serious  travelling  Hamburgward now ensues,  with several less  serious 
attempts  at  trying to sleep..  As is usual on coaches,  the seats have 
been  designed  for pixies which is hellishly uncomfortable  for  anyone 
bigger..  Trying  to  lean  back into the seat effectively  doubles  the 
pressure on your bottom which soon chafes and hurts.. Leaning forward is 
much better,  but comes with a risk of bashing your nose out on the hard 
plastic seat backing..  Maggie Editor hits on brilliant interim solution 
where  he takes detachable part of seat cover and rests head forward  on 
this..  It  is  still  not sleep as we know it Jim,  because as soon  as 
anything  like a dreamlike state starts to happen,  the coach lurches to 
remind you where you are, and you're back to square one again..

(DAY TWO..)

Anyway,  I  liked  to know where we were travelling,  noting the  border 
crossings for Holland and Germany..  Later,  about 2.30am on, a dramatic 
pick up in the quality of night time scenery is observed.. After passing 
through  the  German border area,  some of the most isolated  and  unlit 
areas yet, we pass into what was probably the Ruhr Valley heavy industry 
area,  with  some  stunning night time 'Bladerunner' pastiches of  heavy 
industry..  Maggie  editor  now wide awake and interested..  (Noting the 
existence  of  the little town of 'Wankum',  everyone had a  chuckle  at 
that, sad eh?)

Mike Noyce is also awake,  so it comes to pass that we have an impromptu 
picnic,   finishing   off  his  dried  up  chicken  and  tomato  ketchup 
sandwiches and mini Mars Bars.. Apart from odd sweets and countless cups 
of  coffee  taken  during the day,  this is the only food I  have  until 
6.00pm  that  evening..  Kev Davies sleeps on nearby,  but wakes up  and 
joins us,  and Felice noisily puts in an appearance as well.. All try to 
go back to sleep again, and more countless Autobahn miles slip by..

It  is  just starting to show the first traces of dawn  when  the  coach 
pulls into a service station, this is the last stop just before Hamburg, 
and  we  pile off the coach again,  stepping carefully over  the  liquid 
trail  of whatever that was spilling from the coach toilet  and  running 
down  into  the car park..  This service station has an all  night  cafe 
open,  so we pile in and order our first coffee on German soil..  Coffee 
is  too  kind a word,  as it is basically pure caffeine cut with just  a 
little  hot  water..  However,  it is just what is needed now..  The food 
seems  a  tad expensive (as with all service stations worldwide)  so  we 
leave that where it is..

6.30am..
 
Back on the coach again,  and finally we reach the Hamburg bus station.. 
Bags off, and into the crisp cold morning we set off to find the Central 
Railway  Station  (Haupt-Banhhof) which we do after five  minutes  brisk 
walk..  The next problem is one of killing time,  as the convention does 
not  open  until 12.00pm,  this leaves us with rather a lot of  time  in 
between.. Some initial wandering sets us down on one of the platforms of 
the  railway station,  sitting on some chairs made out of disused  radar 
dishes, which is a good point to pick up on the realtime article again..

Railway Station serious waiting around period -

6.45am.
CiH at the curiously pen-shaped keyboard German train spotting with  the 
rest  of the travellers.  Don't see many of these German train things at 
the Crewe depot - Good job too!

Coach  journey was long,  dark and sleep limited to momentary dozing off 
before  being jolted awake again.  Kev Davies does a brilliant  goldfish 
impersonation  whilst asleep,  mouth wide open to chuck sweetpapers  in. 
Saw  some  impressive Bladerunner style fuck-off scenery  when  we  were 
travelling up the Ruhr valley?

Just  before  getting to Hamburg,  got casually ripped of over a cup  of 
coffee granules and a drop of water. It seems that travel lodges are the 
same wherever.


CHEER UP YOU MISERABLE BUGGERS! - Tat


Look,  I could think of far better places to be at 7.00am in the morning 
than Hamburg Haupt-soddin'-Bahnhof! It's bloody cold as well!! - Arnel


It  looks like Tat is practising his shoplifting skills as  he  clumsily 
stuffs  a  newly packaged shirt into his jacket pocket.  Now 6.55am  CET 
(5.55am proper British time!) and still not any warmer. - CiH


I'm here too.  It's cold and I might as well be on MARS for all the good 
that the tannoy is serving - Taff


One  good  thing from  the coach it may have even made  the  whole  trip 
worthwhile on its own.  As a result of Four Weddings and a blow job star 
Hugh Grant,  we now know the Danish for Fuck!  "Santona" to you all!!  - 
CiH at 7.00am

This goes to fill in just a little bit of time,  as we get up and try to 
find  somewhere more congenial..  A series of pointless wonderings takes 
us to the MacDonalds on the upper levels of the station,  where a fit of 
group indecision and fear of the breakfast results in no-one going  in.. 
Outside,  a  weak  and watery sunrise is taking place,  lighting up  the 
grimy station interior.. Still as cold as ever.. Like the Grand old Duke 
of York's men,  we march back down again to breath in more diesel fumes, 
until  at long,  long last,  we size up and enter a cafe that we spotted 
earlier..

The cafe is almost open,  as we enter and demand coffees all round..  No 
sign of any food,  but the caffeine content once more is such, that mere 
nutrition  has  to  stand aside and concede  defeat..  Lightheaded  with 
relief,  we  fail to spot the next 'problem' that creeps up on us almost 
unawares..  And  this is a good place to pick up on the realtime article 
once again..

Sat here in a cafe, and I've just been threatened by
some drunk German with a knife. God knows what he was

To  put a bit more explanatory flesh on the bare bones of  the  realtime 
article..  A  person of a drunk disposition approached our table in  the 
far  corner,  and  picked on Neil/Arnel,  the other German speaker apart 
from  Tat  in  our  group..  After some brandishing  of  a  (thankfully) 
sheathed  knife,  and  other vague threats that sober people  would  not 
understand, he wobbled away again.. Dead silence ruled during this tense 
time,  as  we  considered  whether  a  quick  overpowering/running  away 
manouvre  would  be  needed..  The  rest of this  bit  of  the  realtime 
perfectly sums up our time in the cafe.. Were we bored or what!

Time to catch a train then,  as Tat and Neil purchase group tickets that 
will  take  us  all the way to Harburg,  the nearest major stop  to  the 
party..Tat  phones one of the organisers,  it looks like that the  doors 
won't be open until the stroke of twelve, but we are on our way anyway.. 
The commuter train is straightforward,  and the journey to Harburg takes 
about ten minutes.. The journey from Harburg, to the party location at a 
place called Hittfeld proves less so..
 
A  very prolonged study of a map by the more  cartographically  inclined 
members of our party takes a ridiculously long time, but it is with some 
hope that we go above ground, and await the bus to Hittfeld..

We  theoretically  have a choice of conveyance to the  show,  either  an 
'hourly'  regular  service,  which  proved  anything but,  and  a  (Non-
appearing)  Shuttle bus laid on by the show organisers..  And that  just 
about sums up how our final leg travel arrangements to Symposium  went.. 
The anticipated time for the hourly bus came and went,  still sunny, but 
not  very  warm..  Tat goes off to try to contact one of the  organisers 
with  no result..  This person is not at home and presumably  organising 
things  (but  not a shuttle bus!) As the minutes  lengthen,  other  lost 
looking souls carry large quantities of baggage appear,  these also seem 
to be going to the Symposium, and we strike up a brief conversation with 
one  of the Amiga contingent,  firmly placing the blame for the bussless 
fiasco on the PC owners organising the thing..

Shortly  before  1.00pm,  our bus finally appears,the  regular  'hourly' 
service,  and a large mass of people pile on..  A nerve-stripping drive, 
no,  more  of  a slalom ride to Hittfeld follows..  Maggie Editor  finds 
himself  standing,  and  almost  having arms torn out  at  the  shoulder 
sockets as a result of drivers extravagant manouvering..

We  de-buss  at Hittfeld ten minutes later,  and a brief walk through  a 
very  sleepy  looking but well-kept village brings us to  the  Symposium 
venue which is based in some function rooms hired from a rather well-to-
do looking restaurant..

 ++The Party!!++

At last we come into contact with the reason for being here,  as several 
official looking people in pinky/purple tee-shirts rush around, take our 
35DM  off  us for the three days entry fee,  and clip a small  piece  of 
unremovable  plastic to our belts..  We seek the Atari area which is not 
hard  to find,  filled with the bodies and hardware of dozens of  Falcon 
owners,  with  the  odd bit or two of other hardware dotted  around  the 
place..  As  the  'UK scene',  we have our own table allocated,  which is 
just about adequate for Tat and his Falcon,  Leon, a small angora rabbit 
named Cyril,  and not a lot else.. Next to us is Arto, a French dude who 
is  singlehandledly  representing the might of the French scene  as  the 
author  of  a new Hydroxid demo,  with whom a quite profitable  creative 
relationship  is struck up with Tat and Leon over the next few days..  A 
bit further on,  the Hungarian contingent,  opposite and down a bit, the 
megamighty Lazer in a corner..

I  glance  around  and end up talking to an  unknown  German  ST  coder, 
hanging around with the group Therapy, with virtually the only ST in the 
room,  who  is  showing off a new demo which does not need one of  those 
fancy Falcon things to work.. Indeed such things as 25 frames per second 
scaling  and rotating,  and even decent texture mapping are shown on the 
humble 'FM.. This unknown fellow is one of the truly dedicated coders at 
the show,  as he showed no sign of stopping, literally crashing out onto 
the keyboard of his computer in the later stages (and he was not he only 
one to do that, eh Tat!)

(Who are you chap! If you are reading this, and know who you are, get in 
touch with us! - CiH)

Part  of the early reconnaissance finds DBA at the near end of the  room 
who  are  literally  typing the first syllables of  the  DBA  real  time 
article,  having got as far as putting the words 'DBA REAL TIME ARTICLE' 
on the screen..  I meet Slimer and look at him,  decide he is very tall, 
and he invites me to kick off the real time article,  which I do.. Other 
people  from  the Maggie Team are soon on there as well,  so it is  some 
time before any other attending humanoids get to put a key in edgeways..

Going  away for a little while,  I retreat to the suspiciously clean and 
peaceful  toilets,  having  a  wash/shit/shave and getting a  change  of 
clothes.  I  feel quite a bit better although the food arrangements  are 
disappointing,  that is,  nothing ready until 6.00pm,  so the stomach is 
tightened  another notch or eight,  but at least a handy coke machine is 
there  and satisfies the thirst/quick cheap burst of false  energy  need 
for 2DM a go.. 

A  further  look  arond the room results in a  sighting  of  the  newest 
version of 'Doomino', the promising Doom-like 3-D texture map engine for 
the Falcon initially shown as a 96k intro last year at Fried Bits.. What 
'Doomino' has become is the nearly complete commercial release 'Running' 
with  a  much  tidier looking and more  optimised  game  engine,  decent 
looking game status panels,  a gun on screen,  and real bad guys!! (Also 
later on,  we saw a really nifty Psygnosis-like rendered intro sequence, 
but we won't hold that against you!) I take the opportunity to introduce 
the  good people of Stax to Maggie 19,  which they quite enjoy (I hope!) 
They say that 'Running' should be ready inside six months..

(Typically, a preview version of this game is only released at 3.00am in 
the morning after we had set off back home..)  :-(

I also get to see in these opening hours;

'Skyfall'  finally working as a fully finished (almost)  game..  Version 
0.96 is released for the Symposium..  Quite an improvement from the very 
early  version  that was briefly shown at the Atari World Xmas  Show  in 
December..  Skyfall also counts as *the* major distraction  from getting 
serious  stuff like this show report done,  and playing of this game has 
had to be severly rationed!!

'Atari  Dream  Machine',  probably  the best 'serious'  German  language 
diskmag with their latest issue, number six, released here.. From what I 
could  grasp of it,  quite up to date and well written..  Talking to the 
editor shows him to be fully aware of Maggie 19 to the extent of  having 
a copy on his hard disk..  Also a major revamp of the menu shell for the 
next issue is imminent as well..

A Jaguar developers kit running some mutant version of the virtual light 
machine, with some very wild plasma shock effects..

Several  of  Tat's new 3-D routines,  shortly to make their way  into  a 
combined  Avena/Digital Chaos demo..  These are very very nice too,  and 
several very movie-like in a 2001 a Space Oddity sort of way! 

More  of  the DBA realtime article,  which Maggie Team input  tended  to 
dominate a lot of..

Lots  and lots of Falcons in huge full size tower cases,  with masses of 
accelerator cards and stuff.. After a while, we did not notice anymore..

Lots  of  people  also  using a 640 x 200 style  desktop  on  their  RGB 
monitors, relieved to see I'm not the only one!!

I Also said hello to the Scandinavian representatives, NoCrew..

Felice gets his camcorder out to start recording people in various poses 
of desperation.. He also recorded a fair bit of what went on in the main 
hall too,  I now have a copy of the tape!  Watch out for screen grabs in 
this  issue!  (We also should be able to see Slimer's tape of the  event 
soon as well..)

A look at the main hall reveals a scene in semi-darkness broken only  by 
the  flickering of hundreds of Amiga,  PC and Commodore 64 screens,  and 
the dominating presence of a twenty foot movie style screen at the front 
of  the  room..  This is used to show continuous films,  animations,  and 
demos from the different computers..  Also later,  it is used to run the 
competition entries as well..

Fascinating   glimpses  of  a  what-might-have-been   participation   on 
alternative  computers leak into the dim atmosphere..  We retreat to the 
bright and comparatively sunlight region of the Atari room..

The  Atari room is now filling up (being about two-thirds full  when  we 
arrived,  and is very tightly packed..  About this time,  the Maggie pen 
and paper realtime article is summoned forth and more comments added  to 
it..

So  far,  we  waited for a very long time - this party seems to be in  a 
'crap  bus  area'  and  we suffered well over an hour  in  the  not  too 
convincing "sunshine." After a teeth rattling ride of many miles to  the 
middle of (German style) nowhere, we are now in the secondary/Atari area 
- the convention is very big and seems to be impressively organised,  on 
the  surface  at least.  I am still a bit miffed about the lack  of  the 
shuttle bus which never showed up-
Still not had any solid food today, since my impromptu picnic at 2.30 am 
with Kev Davies and his dried up Chicken sandwiches..  Pizza and coke at 
18.00h, I'll be there. - CiH


So  far  today,  I've seen demo history being made (points  dramatically 
around the room) there, there and THERE!

A  DBA realtime article is up and running,  and some Maggie Team mambers 
have al                        it.
       re                    to 
         dy  don         vily

Seen  new version of 'Doomino' which is brilliant and almost  full  game 
status,  some very nice STFM texture mapping and rotating (25 frames per 
second,) Tat's rather marvellous demo routines,  some pulsing plasma Jag 
stuff.
Had a long chat with Slimer about the future of DBA Mag,  he seems to be 
more  pro-PC  these  days and suffering from  the  perennial  depression 
caused by lack of outside contributions - However,  look out for more on 
the Magnetic Interlude Web pages from us! - Issue fifteen of DBA Mag due 
soonish as well.. - CiH


Getting  lots of sympathy points relating to the more gruesome  bits  of 
our journey!

Also  discussed Maggie 19 with NoCrew who seem to like it,  and the guys 
may write something for us -

Atari Dream Machine issue 6 is out -

Mr  Pink  is demoing Skyfall,  which looks a lot more like the  finished 
thing, than the preview now. 

'Nother  demo?  Hang  on,  my  pen broke down,  hardware failure on this 
deeply sad lo-tec effort - how pitiful!

(5.00pm)
The  smell of food gets stronger,  ever stronger - several pizzas for me 
tonight    -    CiH


GOD  I'M  HUNGRY!  I feel much better now we have arrived.  I got a  bit 
freaked out earlier because everything I read I cannot understand and  I 
cannot communicate either? But I'm over that now (grin)

I've been mingling since we got here..  I was introduced to the DBA guys 
and have been writing a few things in their realtime article.. I've also 
had a look at Leon's new game "Skyfall", which is very good!
Lots going on! Busy, busy, busy! - Mike N.


Just  watching  the  Symposium entry by TNB  entitled  Falcon  Steam  (I 
think..) So for, looking pretty good. - Taff

6.00pm or 18.00h CET, and D-PLUS 1.5777 seconds..
Time passes in that effortless Catherine de Medici nibbling absently  at 
the corner of a mousemat manner,  which it likes to do..  We sight signs 
of life in the eating pit,  or rather,  the serving food to the starving 
masses  pit,  as  various pizza preparing persons bestir  themselves  to 
frenzied  cooking  type activity..  Which means that three innocent  and 
unfortunate  Amiga owners who GOT IN MY WAY are killed in the  rush..  I 
order pizza twice,  or zwei to be really accurate,  to go (to the nearby 
unoccupied  tables)  and eat,  a joining in of the rest of the  visiting 
party follows as I stuff, chew and generally cram my stomach.. The pizza 
is  moderately ok,  which translates to absolutely the best thing I have 
ever eaten in my foodless since 2.30am previously state..

I go back for thirds..

The rest of the first evening passes quietly enough as we settle down to 
an  ordered routine,  people who can code getting intermittent space  on 
Tat's Falcon, the rest of us pacing around the show.. About this time, I 
notice  that  there  are Commodore 64's in quite large  numbers  at  the 
show..  Several  of these machines have a suspicious bank of switches on 
the  top,  and I discover that these are the toggles for such things  as 
new issue ROMs,  boosted up (20mhz!) processors,  extra (256K) memory, 1 
GB  hard drives and more??  As it is they are still capable of producing 
some  spiffy effects on their own,  with one machine running a digitised 
looping  film  sequence  from Terminator that went  on  for  some  time, 
another  running  a  flaming vector effect  (according  to  Tat,  *very* 
difficult to do on a C64!) At a gathering at the Dutch end of the  room, 
I see Sentry's Commodore 128 running a Wolfenstein style texture  mapped 
dungeon..  A  listing  for the event had about thirty crews for the  C64 
attending,  and it is amazing that this machine should still have such a 
big following after all this time,  and gives hope to the rest of us who 
still prefer to work on non "commercial" formats..

Other  things that are done that evening include a further visit to  the 
Dutch section where there is more clowning around done on their realtime 
article.  They  are  also up to some traditional Dutch Fried  Bits  type 
activities,  which include showing Ren and Stimpy on the video,  with my 
favourite episode starring 'Powdered Toast Man', and several pictures of 
a  rather dubious nature showing courtesy of XTC-1 of Sentry..  At least 
until  some  purple T-shirted person comes over and tells them  to  stop 
doing that..

Also  a bit later,  we get to see several Falcon demos on the big screen 
in the main hall,  pre-recorded onto video tape, as several seem to have 
been cut short or with some bits edited out..  In this fashion we get to 
see  the Obnoxious demo,  and last years Fried Bits entries,  except the 
EKO  system  demo..  A  surprising omission,  but if Symposium could  be 
summed  up  in  a simple single phrase,  that phrase  would  be  'German 
dominated!'  Apart from the Dutch guys,  NoCrew doing their thing in the 
far  corner for Scandinavia,  Arto singlehandedly holding up the  French 
interest, some Hungarians, and of course, us few from the UK, just about 
all the rest of the people at the party came from the German scenes..

I  reach  a  startling conclusion about Slimer at this  point,  and  his 
resemblance to a certain lead actor in 'Confessions of a Window Cleaner' 
and  similar such movies!!  This disclosure finding its way onto the DBA 
realtime text..

Just to finish the last few scraps of realtime article for the first day 
at the party..

Hmmmmm...

Just  about the last thing that we do that day,  is to attend the  laser 
show  which  is running in the main hall shortly before  midnight..  All 
thoughts of sleep banished for the moment,  we settle down as the public 
address  system requests all the monitors and sound systems in the  main 
hall be turned off,  an expectant hush falls over the hall, as the first 
part  of a 'kicking' soundtrack starts up,  with the promise of  lengthy 
and  spectacular light pictures all over the hall..  About five  minutes 
later, it all shudders to a stop, and that is really it.. Several people 
sardonically take it as eloquent commentary on the state of organisation 
of the event as the PC,  Amiga, and C64 sponsored burble starts up again 
in  the  main hall..  We (non coding) members of the UK  visiting  party 
decide to call it a (very long) day and find a place to kip..

The  'sleeping  room',  seems  to be a ad-hoc adaptation of one  of  the 
unused  computing  rooms,  tables  and some chairs abound..  We clear  a 
space,  trying not to disturb the few people already in there and settle 
our  sleeping  equipment into position..  I inflate my airbed  with  the 
footpump, Felice goes for his sleeping bag, and so does Mike Noyce.. Kev 
Davies reaches for the floor, and is happy with that..

DAY THREE..

Time passed ever so s-l-o-w-l-y..

The airbed is surprisingly very comfortable..  Sleep comes quite easily, 
or  at  least it does,  once the procession of people moving  into,  and 
through  the  room,  also seeking a place to rest,  stops a couple or so 
hours later,  and I sleep,  very,  very deeply,  until about 8am or soon 
after,  when a distinct chill in the air wakes me up..  Even then I only 
rise  up  very slowly and make my way to the toilets to indulge  in  the 
usual shit/shave/wash routine..

For  some  reason known only to German speakers,  the gents toilets  are 
closed  (something to do with cleaning them??) So I find myself  sharing 
the  little  girls room with some unidentified females who  are  washing 
their hair in the sinks.. This does not complicate matters though, and I 
am soon ready to return to the Atari room related fray..

Not too much is going on,  Kev Davies, and Neil are also up at about the 
same  time,  Mike Noyce is still asleep,  and Leon has bedded down in an 
obscure  corner  of the hall,  and after his display of lateness on  the 
realtime article,  he is deservedly asleep..  Tat has slept where he has 
fallen,  on  his  Falcon..  The Maggie pen and paper realtime article is 
trapped under his head.. Slimer and the DBA team are also sort of awake, 
Slimer  not  too happy having had very little sleep in  the  night..  As 
people collect themselves together,  me, Neil and Kev decide to go for a 
little walk around the metropolis of Hittfeld..  The word 'breakfast' is 
not  spoken  by any of us,  but at the top of my mind at least,  as  the 
rather limited food facilities do not do anything until noon..

After  a  wander  in the grey chill morning air,  the  word  'breakfast' 
managed  to  remain unspoken,  as we returned to base  hungry..  Several 
Symposium goers laden down with paper carrier bags return from the local 
supermarket, which seems like a really good place to go next..

Collecting the remaining members of the UK party, now that Felice, Mike, 
Leon  and  Tat have joined us,  we set out again for the supermarket  as 
food is now definitely on the 'things to do' list..  The idea is to fill 
up  with crisps and drink and related junk,  to reduce our dependence on 
the pricey pizza concession..  Tat,  Leon, Kev and Mike head off for the 
supermarket.. Myself, Neil, and Felice take in a nearby cafe..

The cafe is small,  pleasantly appointed, and part of a rural scene that 
only expects about three exciting things a year to happen..  Our arrival 
seems  to  add  a  fourth  to that list,  as  we  order  various  exotic 
combinations of coffee and hot chocolate..  Unlike the Hamburg cafe, no-
one  appears to brandish a slicing implement at us,  and dare I say  it, 
the natives were pleasant!

Having  topped up caffeine levels nicely,  we go to join the rest at the 
bulging mini-mart..

The supermarket is very crowded with Saturday morning shoppers,  part of 
that  is  due  to  the  weight of  extra  Symposium  customers  such  as 
ourselves.. A lot of it is also due to the Teutonic keenness on Saturday 
half-day  closing,  and  Sunday  closing..  No walking to the 'open  all 
hours'  place  up  the road here..  We find the others,  and load up  on 
crisps, bacon snacks, (weak) orange drink, Coke, peanuts, tortilla chips 
KitKats,  and  more..  We steer clear of German Mars Bars which are two-
thirds scale models of proper Mars Bars,  and twice as expensive..  Some 
members  of the party take up baguette type things which turn out to  be 
part-baked  bread,  delicious  if finished off in a hot oven for ten  or 
fifteen  minutes and eaten with garlic butter whilst still  hot..  Tough 
going if not baked for for that sort of time before consumption, in fact 
rather  rubbery in texture,  and there was no oven amongst the toasters, 
coffee machines, waffle makers and prototype nuclear reactors fixed into 
tower cases found at the Symposium.. Still, nobody minded..

We  get  back and settle down and the sound of contented  crunching  and 
rustling noises rises from our bit of the hall shortly after..  A little 
while after that sees us sitting back in the Atari room opposite  Slimer 
and  XTC-1  of  Sentry  who  are  unenthusiatically  slapping  breakfast 
together..  About  this  time,  the  realtime article makes  an  overdue 
reappearance..

(Fancy fades and dissolves etc..)

11.20am..
CiH  at  the pen again as we struggle to make sense of  things,  sitting 
opposite  members  of  Sentry and DBA who are making  breakfast  out  of 
whatever they have lying around.

To recap:
After a nightmare journey lasting several thousand years, we arrive in a 
place  in  the  middle  of nowhere (N.  Germany.) Some  rather  odd  but 
sumptious demos later, we retired to bed shattered. Pleasantly surprised 
that we managed to sleep a decent nights sleep,  go shopping to stock up 
on essential junk fodder, and here we are again.


11.25am
Well, long time no see, Mr Realtime. We would have added
something earlier, only Tat was asleep on top of it. 
Nobody had the heart to wake (kick?) him. So, we've been
out and got some brekkie, a pity there aren't any fast
food joints here, really (Oooh for a currywurst right now!) 
              - Arnel
11.30am

     A paper realtime article? It seems like a nice idea.
     You can do it everywhere, even in the confort of 
     your own home.
     At the moment we have a little time discussing how
     to make the 96Ktro, making breakfast, and generally
     having a laugh. The only negative thing about this
     article is my handwriting. That is one lousy font
     (5 x 3 pixel!) c u later.      XTC-1 of Sentry


11.36am
Yes,  Mike  here  with the real-time pen and the real-time paper.  Had a 
good few hours in the land of slumber.  Boy did I need that!  We've been 
shopping  in  the local mini-market for a few essential  supplies.  Just 
chatting now.


11.40am
Felice just said there is a *third* realtime article apart from ours and 
DBA - must check it out?  - CiH

11.42am
Yes,  you are right. The 3rd realtime article is from the Swedish NoCrew 
on a little VT220. - Mike


11.50am
Nice chat with XTC of Sentry -- Red Dwarf,  X-Files, and now the Formula 
One Grand Prix - No-one likes Jacques Villeneuve!!   

We also decided the Michael Schumacher deliberately overlooked Ferrari's 
'crap  car'  record  (unblemished in Grand Prix) to get  a  25  million 
paycheque!! Well if you can.... 

A bit more about last night - Tat was slumped on the keyboard for  quite 
a  long time this morning.  - This article bears the headprint scar from 
this  ordeal.  Leon slept under some tables quite near the sleeping room 
where  we  were.  I eyed this spot up as a preliminary spot  before  the 
sleeping  room.  Kev Davies had himself and a floor as special  sleeping 
equipment. - CiH


12.01pm
Tat here: Everyone looks and feels a lot better this morning
after recovering from the coach trip - my "pillow computer" 
antics seem not to have escaped attention - but hardly
anyone seems to be *doing* anything? 
Suits me fine since I haven't worked out my algorithms
for the stuff I'm coding. Time to bumble about again
and eat supermarket food....

12.02pm
Taff  here,  I've  done  some  work  (major  self-gratification)  on  my 
university  project...  A  full  six  pages  of  bollocks  er,  absolute 
bollocks, still at least I've done something. The floor was surprisingly 
comfortable..

12.10pm
Will I be able to read this back again??
I doubt it.. - CiH

Reminiscing about the Maggie party now..

We  do  get up and do some other things,  visiting NoCrew in  their  far 
corner of the Atari room..  They have attended the party with members of 
Inner  Circuit  Explorers (ICE for short) also,  and is is very nice  to 
finally  get to meet some of the nice people who sent me STe  demos  all 
those  years ago for Maggie..  We get to see the NoCrew Aggression party 
entry  in  action (finally) and indeed discover that there  is  a  third 
realtime  party article up and running,  this on a VT220 terminal on  an 
Internet link up..  We donate the odd paragraph or two,  leaving a heavy 
Maggie Team smudge all over the otherwise pristine Swedish text..  

Shortly after, the terminal locks up.. Coincidence??

Afterwards,  the  afternoon  passes  in a leisurely fashion  as  we  sit 
around, eat, drink, pass scatological comment on what appears on the big 
screen,  generally  arsing around as others sweat and worry towards  the 
competition deadlines..

In  short,  quite a long spell where the pen and paper realtime  article 
takes over once more..

12.36pm   NoCrew and Ice is down here visiting.
          We placed ourself in the smallest corner
          it's almost like a sauna. We are sitting
          here arguing about different line algorithms.

         So far we are going well. Too bad we got no tea.


12.45pm 
CiH  back  after  the  NoCrew interlude  -  seen  (finally)  the  NoCrew 
Aggression party demo - very nice.

Also heard that Dead Hackers Society were due to visit,  but they had to 
finish  their  winning Aggression Party demo now!!  They are doing  this 
instead of attending the competition.


12.48
       And the Taff is back, ready to thrill you with more
        Lukewarm  news and articles.  Well the net connection
       has  gone down, NoCrew have their realtime article 
        thing running on a VT terminal with a German keyboard..
       Check out my spelling (grin!)

 
1.00pm.  Mr Pink beats Zweckform in Skyfall and wins a free demo version 
of  the  2D  shooter Painium Disaster.  So wait until  next  time!  I'll 
practise!  And watch out for our intro taking part in intro compo! Watch 
out for Anvil Soft game and Cruor stuff, keep on supporting the greatest 
of them all, Falcon! (Zweckform)


13:14.  Wingleader/Synergy here to write something for the
        realtime article (on paper, yeah, back to the old
        days) for Maggie. I'm here for about 1.5 days now
        can say give me Bremen and the Fried Bits back.
        And now for some greetings for the old Maggie
        Team: Hi Sammy Joe, what do you do these days?
        Further greetings to everyone I know.


1.25pm
Just  saw a really nice A1200 demo - hope something as good for  Falcon, 
but I wonder this time? 

Still the Hydroxid demo does not look too bad - with expert help from Mr 
Pink, this may make the competition? 

Time for a coke and some dodgy snax.. CiH


1.40pm
CiH again - Why do they make german supermarket shopping bags so  noisy. 
And what is going on with the 'Virtual Coke Machine' - you put the money 
in,  turn  the handle (or press the big red button) - a loud can falling 
down type clunk follows, but no can!
You have to reach right inside the machine to get your drink, lucky then 
that Mike Noyce mentioned this last night..
 

1.45pm
Yes,  the same thing happened to me last night twice?!  It happened to a 
lot of other people though. Sometimes you'd put the money in and get two 
cans - yours and someone elses.

'Spiderman The Movie' is on, the big screen at the moment. Unfortunately 
it's dubbed in German.  Pity they couldn't overdub the crappy 70's music 
as well (grin!) - Mike N.
 

1.57pm.  This is Taff slowly dying from radiation being produced by over 
200 monitors, Aaagh!
Oh yeah,  Spiderman (the movie) is on the vid wall,  hurrah,  but its in 
German, boo!


2.00pm
I've just thought. We should be able to get Rich Karsmakers in this text 
when we meet him on Monday. Another four pages taken care of then, might 
as well put our feet up and relax now. - CiH

2.05pm
And more..  Is the german dubbed Spiderman film supposed to be some kind 
of cult thing over here or wot? - CiH

2.10pm
Har har, Spiderman has crashed! - Cih

2.10 and a half 
Spiderman has returned with great flair and style.-Taff

2.12pm
Yes, they had great flares in those days! (c.1976) - CiH

2.12 and a half 
Sorry Chris, Spiddy the movie was made in the early 80's, possibly '79 - 
Taff

2.13 and a bit
Piss  off Barry Norman!  They were still having hangovers from the worst 
excesses of Seventies fashion even then. - CiH

2.13 and three quarters
Pointless  tannoy announcements continue (read the DBA realtime  article 
for more on that) Oh yeah, Spiderman has ended. - Taff

2.16 and 26 seconds
Shut up you loud German person!  Depraved filth on a PC - lets go see! - 
CiH

2.19 Ha! Spiderman was made in 1977. So there. - Mike N.

2.20pm
And  that's the end of that little run of meaningless utterances,  thank 
Kerrist! - CiH


2.21pm
I'm going for a meander!?!? - Taff


2.23pm
My watch says 2.23? 

  (Shock horror! Maggie realtime article in timekeeping)
  (inconsistencies frenzy!)

Time for some PC intros on the big screen. - CiH


2.25pm
Wish someone would turn the brightness up on that monitor (20ft screen!) 
To say that it is dark is a bit of an understatement. - CiH


2.28pm
Hmm,  it is a bit hard to see.  The first PC intro demo was crap anyway. 
The next one is better. - Jungle Fever it is called.

This next one is really good - old silent movie style! Sure hi-tech now. 
- Mike N.

2.30pm
The  last intro my collegue was referring to was a piss-take of  an  old 
silent B/W movie,  crackly 'old film' bits and all,  and was a 3-D style 
streetscene  with  all  the 1896 style folks rushing  around  at  double 
speed.  A tinkly repetitive piano soundtrack playing,  very clever, very 
original. Something for Falcon folks to think on? - CiH


2.32 I'm not sure how well one coke machine will last
the convention, still, I've got my flask of weak lemon
drink to fall back on! -         Simon Quinlank!


2.40pm
Won't falling on a flask do you an injury? - Neil

2.41pm No, it got stuck when I fell on it!

2.42pm
I don't want to know

2.43 Ok then, I won't tell you!

2.45pm
Yooh  guys.  Here Bonus using a PEN (well that's a while ago since I did 
that)  to make a piece for Maggie's Real time article.  Well what can  I 
write? I think that Bremen was better, well for the Atari's that is. The 
scene was better, we had more to do, the Mac was close by. Sooo could we 
go back to Bremen next year. Pretty please with sucker on!
