                        THE MAGGIE INTERVIEW:

                       RIPLEY OF RESERVOIR GODS

Welcome to  another  incisive  Maggie  interview.  This  time  sitting
sweating on the hotseat is Ripley of top coding team "Reservoir Gods".
Ripley is a graphics artist whose  work  can  be seen on Double Bobble
2000, The Tautology Series and Sky-Fall.  She also painted some of the
graphics for Maggie.

Ripley (real name  Natasha  O'Reilly)  is  17  and  currently studying
History, English and Art at A-Level in sunny Wales.

M) What was your first experience with computers?

R) Hmm.. well that would take me  back  a  few years to when Leon (Mr.
Pink) bought his first computer, which  was (of course) a Spectrum 48K
with rubber keys.  Just about  the  first  game  I  saw and played was
called 3D (in name only)  Deathchase,  which  involved having to avoid
lots of trees and shoot  some  elusive  helicopters and tanks.  It was
closely  followed  by  better   games   such   as  Jetpack,  Saboteur,
Spyhunter..

M) When did you start doing  computer  art? What was the first package
you used?

R) Since the Spectrum didn't really have any art packages to speak of,
and with only 8 colours and  an  inordinate  amount of colour clash, I
didn't start doing any grafs until  we  bought  an STFM and no serious
ones until we got hold of D Paint..  But the first package I ever used
was Doctor Doodle.. yes, mono, gem based.  I'm surprised it didn't put
me off for life.

M) What have been your favourite and least favourite art packages?

R) This question has the potential  to  turn  into a six thousand word
thesis, so I'll keep  it  short..   My  favourite  art  package is God
Paint, of course I'm biased, but  when  Mr.  Pink coded it, just about
it's only rival was an early version of  True Paint (in fact it was me
complaining about True Paint  that  prompted  him  to  code it), which
leads me onto my least favourite  package..  The early version of True
Paint was  truly  abysmal,  cutting  blocks  was  a  seriously complex
operation, it was  gem based, it had a  colour wheel and the res I had
to run it in made all the grafs  look squished.  Argh! I don't want to
think about it any more, the memories are too painful.

M) What functions do you find most useful in computer art packages?

R) Magnify.  RGB bars  with  keyboard  short-cuts  so  you can quickly
create colours.  Block functions such as X-Ray etc.

M) How do you  think  computer  art  compares  to  hand  drawn art? Is
computer art as valid as conventional paintings?

R) I find it  a  lot  easier  to  draw  by  hand,  but  it is almost a
completely different skill.  On the  computer, apart from  preliminary
sketching, I almost exclusively use the  magnify window so I'm working
on small details and  do not see the rest of the picture, whereas with
hand drawn hard art I'm more  aware  of  the  image as a whole.  Also,
with Computer art, a lot of  time  is  spent  shading to take away the
squareness of the pixels  and  anti-alias  lines,  but with hand drawn
art, drawing realistic curves  is  easy  and  you  don't have to worry
about pixels.  Because of  the  difference  between  them I think that
comparing computer graphics to paintings  is  a  bit like comparing an
etching to a  painting,  both  are  forms  of  art,  but  both require
different skills to create them.  And  this  does not mean that one is
somehow superior to  the  other,  both  have  their  own strengths and
merits and each is just as valid as the other.

M) What do you think about the use of scanners by graphics artists?

R) As a graphist, it is all  too  tempting to use scanners because you
get an instant picture, without the weeks/months of hard work.  And so
in that respect it seems as  if  you are somehow cheating, because you
haven't suffered enough to  create  the  image.   But I think scanning
pictures which you  have  hand-drawn/painted  yourself is okay because
you created the original, and by scanning it are just translating your
own work, onto a different format.   And  if  you think about it, most
art involves copying something you see  onto paper/canvas etc., so why
then does a painting become  anything  more  than a less than accurate
photograph of the image it  is  representing.  Where art parts company
with photographs and scanned images  is  when  you create a completely
original image, something  you  entirely  designed  and drew yourself,
without copying  from  anything.   This  is  the  most  difficult  and
original form of art.  But  even  so,  it will have influences, things
you saw once and remembered, even if they are only subconscious.
     Scanning images saves a lot  of  time,  so that begs the question
why is it necessary for  an  artist  to  sit  down and manually copy a
picture of say, a building,  which  may  take months and will probably
not look as realistic, when that  person  could just scan a photograph
of it and save themselves  the  time.   However  if they do that, they
could hardly credit themselves with  having  created the graphics. The
ethics of using scanners  are   a  far  more  complex issue than first
appears on the surface, but I feel  that if a graphist scans something
that is not theirs, then they could  no  more claim the image is their
own work, than a photograph taking  a  picture  of the Mona Lisa could
claim to have created that.  Even if a graphist scans a photograph and
then touches it up in an  art  package,  it still seems very much like
cheating.

M) What other computer artists (past  and present) do you respect? Who
are your inspirations?

R) Mc Fly, Agent T.  I  also  like  a  lot of French graphics artists:
Niko, Nitrik, Flan (loved the bunny in Yepyha by the way :), they have
a really impressive,  stylized  form  of  graphics,  which  is somehow
always recognisably French.

M) You made your debut in  the  Tautology  game. Looking back, what do
you think of these graphics now?

R) On a par to Mr.  Pink's  first  coding effort i.e. experimental.  I
also have a better excuse than he, because I had to use True Paint and
he didn't ;)

M) What work are you most proud of?

R) All the stuff I'm going to do, but which is still in my head :^)
     Okay, really, um.. I liked the Double Bobble stuff but not all of
that was  my  own  design  because  we  had  to  be  make  a  faithful
conversion, so the stuff I'm most proud  of is stuff I designed myself

which nobody outside Reservoir Gods  has  seen  because it hasn't been
used yet, or I've recently done it and haven't sent it to anyone.

M) What is your main motivation for creating games on the Falcon?

R) Just a desire  to  create  something  which  other Atari people are
going to enjoy, maybe just a desire to be creative.

M) What are your favourite computer games (past and present)?

R) On the Spectrum my favourite  games were Rigel's Revenge (best ever
text  adventure),  Trap  Door,  the  Dizzy  games  (on  ST  as  well),
Spyhunter, Head Over Heels.. many, many more.
     On the ST I  liked  Dungeon  Master,  Supercars  II, Gauntlet II,
Monkey Island, Loom, Indian Jones and the Last Crusade (adventure game
version), Rick Dangerous..
     And on Falcon all Reservoir Gods  games of course, Nethack, Midi-
Wiz, Robinson's Requiem (except it's  too  difficult  and a bit slow),
the Ishar series...

M) Personally, what computer game would  you like to see the Reservoir
Gods code?

R) A completely  original  one.   Or  a  Gauntlet  II, overhead, four-
player, 'Red Elf is IT' style game.

M) What is your opinion of demos? What are your favourite demos?

R) A computer that does not have  a  demo scene is either dead, or too
primitive on the hardware  side  (our  48K  Speccy wouldn't quite have
managed a 96Ktro).  A demo  scene  keeps  a  computer alive long after
commercial companies have  deserted  it  for  more  profitable waters,
there's still C64 demos coming out, and dare I say it, ST stuff?
     I like demos as long as  they  are  worthy  of seeing, that is if
they have good effects, are  well coded, technically impressive and/or
designed and well put together.  I  don't  think there's much point in
someone doing a demo if they don't  do it well (read Mr. Pink's review
of the Trantor demo..).
     Among my most  watched  demos  are  the  Avena/Digital Chaos demo
(released at Fried Bits III), Evolution  by  EXA: the grafs and design
are just beautiful, Cycedelic Knockout and Lost Blubb, then Eko System
for its 3D,  Terrorize  Your  Soul  for  being  so  impressive  and X-
perienced for being just about the only  demo  that will run on my VGA
monitor.

M) Which demo crews do you most admire and why?

R) French crews such as EXA  and  Hydroxid for their superb design and
Graphics, Lazer for Lost Blubb and  that high quality Stax music, then
Inter for having a certain coder called  Lucky of ST who happens to be
quite good..

M) Which sort of demo effects do you most like and least like?

R) Least liked demo effects are: fractal zooms, because  they're a bit
passe in the wake of stuff like phong shading, bump-mapping etc.
     Most liked effects are magnify spheres,  e.g. the one on Hydroxid
96 demo, water ripple effects (end  effect on Avena/Digital Chaos) and
3D  in  general,  although   I   prefer   it  if  its  gouraud/texture
mapped/light-sourced etc.

M) Why do you think there are so few women in the computer scene?

R) For the same reason that  there  so  few female  car mechanics: men
were there first so  women  feel  it  is  almost  taboo  to break into
something with just about  zero  female  precedents.   Also, there are
not that many women interested  in  computers  to  the degree that men
are, but then I know a lot more female poets than male ones.

M) What do you feel that women can bring to the computer scene?

R) Just as much as men.

M) Have you ever thought  of  forming  an  all-girl group with Martina
from Lazer?

R) No, because I'm not very good at dancing.

M) Outside of computers what are  your other interests? What music and
books do you enjoy?

R) I like writing creatively (stories and poems), art in general   and
films such as Reservoir Dogs, Alien  and especially Aliens, as you may
have guessed ;)
     The books I  like  are  all  those  written  by  J  R  R Tolkien,
especially 'Lord  of  the  Rings'  (Gollum  was  always  my  favourite
character, with his endearing 'fisheses').   I also like Shakespeare's
plays, especially Hamlet and Macbeth.  As  for  music, I like a lot of
techno/trance stuff such  as  Underworld,  Leftfield,  Orbital, Robert
Miles, Salt  Tank,  as  well  as  bands  such  as  Pulp,  Manic Street
Preachers, Suede..
     I enjoy the occasional (card) game  of 'Magic The Gathering' with
Mr. Pink, except when his Royal Assassin and Sengir Vampire turn up.

M) Tell us a bit about all the other members of Reservoir Gods.

R) I have plenty of  stories  about  Mr.  Pink's exploits as a budding
golf caddy and C64 owner  but he'd probably not want me to divulge his
young and tender years to the hardened Maggie readers.  However, for a
price I might feel inclined..
     Sparehead 3, otherwise known as Kev 'Cuthbert' Dempsey, currently
holidaying in America, author of the  thumping techno classic that was
the Taut II music and the  top  graphist  of Reservoir Gods, is always
saying  that  his  grafs   &   music   are   crap,  despite  continual
contradictions from myself, Mr. Pink  and  many  other people.  So, if
ya'll want to  write  into  Maggie,  to  try  to  convince  him of his
greatness you know the address.
     Charles, part of the ST branch  of  the Reservoir Gods, (in other
words, hasn't got round to getting  a  Falcon yet) coder of the smart,
still unfinished, 3D racing game called Hyper-Racing?
     Tim, the second coder of  Hyper-Racer, studying for maths degree,
got annoyed at Charles' practical  bomb-out  after 5 minutes coding on
Devpac joke.  But otherwise, they're  like brothers.  He's writing the
Reservoir packer (we think).
     Surrogate members include  Tat  (of  Avena)  for  his DSP Tracker
routines and handy coding hints, Darryl  for  giving (yes giving) us a
sampling cable, and Malc, friend of  Kev,  for the occasional, as yet,
unused pieces of music.

M) What do you think of the people you have met on the computer scene?


R) Mainly very nice (although Groo  of the Lemmings was an exception).
The coders seem more obsessed  than  the  graphists, but then I've met
more coders (and had to live with one).

M) Have you attended any  computer  parties,  and  if so, what did you
think of them? Would you want to attend more?

R) I've been to a few parties:  all the Reservoir Gods Conventions (of
course) and the Maggie 5th  Birthday  Party.   They  were all a lot of
fun, especially when playing multiplayer games  of Midi maze 2 because
I'm too cunning and no-one  can  beat  me  at it.  Dynabusters is also
cool with six players.
     And yes, I would like to go to more.

M) What is your opinion  of  Atari  Corp?  Why  do you think the Lynx,
Falcon and Jaguar have  not  done  very  well?  (Insert Alastair Bodin
slaggings here)

R) I'm not sorry to have  to  say  it, Atari Corp. is really pathetic,
especially Atari UK.  What other  company, presented with the hardware
that Atari has had, would have  consistently  managed to kill off such
great machines.  Have they  never  heard  of  advertising?  How about,
advertising coupled  with  distribution?   The  biggest  problem  with
something like the Falcon was that the public couldn't get their hands
on the machines, there  weren't  enough  shipments  for the demand and
they weren't sold in enough different shops.
     Another thing, it seems that once  Atari have released a machine,
they almost immediately decided to  concentrate  on their next machine
and not bother marketing or  producing games/programmes for the first.
This happened with the  Falcon,  Atari  just  dropped  it because they
wanted to concentrate on the Jaguar.   And talking of the Jaguar, just
what has happened?  Wasn't  there  going  to  be  a virtuality helmet?
Wasn't there going to be lots  of  GOOD  games, I could count the good
Jag games currently  available  on  one  hand.   The  Head of software
development at Atari UK has a lot to  answer for.  And we all know who
he is (and where he lives (and the names of his children)).

M) What do you think is the future for Atari and Atari owners?

R) The future  for  Atari,  unless  they  get  an  incredibly wealthy,
intelligent, business-minded benefactor, does not look as if its going
to do anything radical.   The  mythological  Microbox is obviously not
going to be developed, and even if  it was, no doubt Atari would again
mess up on marketing.  But  I'm  optimistic  that  it will not die out
completely, maybe not even much more  than  it already has, because it
has a very loyal, dedicated, if  small, user-base and these are people
who have  been there since the start, and who will continue to support
Atari, if only out of nostalgia.  They  may well buy  another more up-
to-date machine, but I'm sure they'll find a way of holding onto their
Falcons/STs  etc.,  and  that's  all  that's  needed  to  keep  people
producing games and demos.

M) What do you think is the future for the Reservoir Gods?

R) Future?  We've only just begun :)

M) Well good luck  with  all  your  future  productions and thanks for
taking part in this interview.
