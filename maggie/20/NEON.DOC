Yes everyone, Maggie finally get their hands  on the piece of kit that
everyone has been talking about. Admittedly "everyone" in this context
means "everyone who has a Falcon and  really wants 3D Studio but isn't
a greedy PC owner who can copy it off his mates" but let's not quibble
here.

Previews of this have  been  around  since  late  1994 with a splendid
video showing what  is  possible  with  the  software,  and indeed the
example files are some  of  the  real  scenes  used in the animations,
which you can render yourself (and  fiddle  about with to put your own
name in, of course.) Lip-smackingly good, in fact.

The copy that Maggie reviewed was  "on  loan"  for a week from another
magazine (cheers!) so it was with some regret that I handed the dongle
back to its rightful owner as  he  returned to another country. Still,
thanks for the memories. And, dear readers,  here are my notes, so you
can make your own minds up...



        AND THEY'RE OFF

Once fully installed the NeoN files take  up a fair chunk of your hard
drive (about 8 megs) but this  includes  a good ration of textures and
graphics, as well as test  files  to  play  with.  The whole system is
modular, in that there are separate  sections to design single objects
similar to an application like  Cyber-Sculpt  (the object editor), and
another to  place  multiple  objects,  render  and  animate  them (the
scenery editor). Just click on the scenery editor in hi-res 256 colour
mode, and you're away!

Initial impressions are,  unsurprisingly,  very  daunting, even though
the display itself is very uncluttered.  The menus are placed down the
left hand side, while  four  display screens (top/right/front/3d-view)
take up most of the rest. There seem to be at least five times as many
options as you could possibly want,  but after five hours of clicking,
and the hint that using Control,  Alternate and Shift were useful, all
the functions were  reasonably  understandable.  And  that was without
once reverting to reading the manual...



        IN USE

After loading in a sample file, some of the latent power of the system
was quickly revealed. Greedy for  action,  we  tried out the rendering
speed and options and are  pleasantly  surprised. Rendering is allowed
to screen  or  disk  and  a  variety  of  screen  sizes  (for  preview
renderings) are  possible.  There  are  two  types  of  rendering,  Z-
buffering (quicker but  slighly  more  limited)  and ray-tracing (much
slower  although  some  effects  look   better,  for  instance  mirror
effects.) Special rendering effects,  such  as transparency, mirroring
and anti-aliasing can be individually controlled.

....and it's  quick!  Not  quite  mind-blowing,  but  very  good  when
compared to its Atari predecessors.  Even with mirror and environment-
mapping effects, the  very  intelligently-written  Z-buffering allowed
quick sorting and  calculation,  and  the  calculation  itself is very
accurate - no dodgy mapping errors here.  It's also great fun to watch
the picture being built up before your  very eyes. At least, I thought
so.

Back to the scenery editor. After  a  few minutes' use, the object and
drawing update speeds begin to become slightly annoying - a redraw was
needed when absolutely anything was  done  to  the scenery. Control of
zoom, rotate and movement was reasonably  intuitive, using mouse and a
selection of control keys. It's  not  easy, of course, but considering
how much 3D editors have to  do,  it's much simpler than playing Elite
on a BBC! The main problem  was  a confusing method of controlling the
camera position and viewing direction - Two buttons are marked "Cam ->
View" and "View -> Cam", where one  sets the rendering view, the other
the scenery editor's own view, and I still can't remember which button
meant what...



        GO ON THEN, DO SOMETHING NEAT

The object editor is the crux  of  the  package though. Each object is
saved as a  separate  file,  then  postioned  and  animated  using the
scenery editor. A variety of methods of object creation were available
for example  primitives  such  as  spheres  and  cubes,  extrusion  of
templates, spinning about an axis or  the  use of text fonts to create
letters. All these means are very  powerful, highly tweakable and gave
good quality results  -  the  ability  to  automatically create curved
outlines was a particular boon - but in comparison to packages such as
Cyber Sculpt, there was a lack  of  the overall precision available in
the abovementioned applications. Perhaps this is  due to my being more
at home with a package written in 1986...

Some of the tools to tweak the  overall  object are great fun. Want to
bevel (smooth) the edges of objects?  No problem. Bend? Twist? Jitter?
They're all  there  and  very  fast.  Then  the  crowning  glory:  the
materials editor screen is a joy to  use,  with the ability to see the
material created at any time.  There's  texture mapping, bump mapping,
surface mapping, mirroring,  and  it's  all  a  joy  to  use and looks
stunning as you finally work out  how  to  apply the damn thing to the
object you've made (it took me ages!)



        OVERALL

The problem with a few days to review  a package as big as NeoN is the
inability to due justice to it,  plus  the  months of practice and the
700+ Deutschmarks needed  to  get  the  most  from  it.  Even from the
intensive workout we threw at it,  NeoN hardly broke sweat (apart from
a couple of crashes after rendering  and an annoying sporadic keyboard
bug.)

So it's an awesome  package  and  it  gives  even  its overpaid PC big
brothers a good run for its money. Pointing out its omissions tends to
detract from the wealth of things it  can do, and anyone serious about
graphics on  a  Falcon  is  firmly  recommended  to  add  it  to their
collection alongside Apex Media. Splendid - now can anyone recommend a
good bank to rob?
