This is an adaption of a little game that Monty Python invented  called 
'Cheese Shop'..  Very simply,  in the Pythonesque original,  you played 
the  proprieter  of the cheese shop in question,  another player  would 
play  the  customer who would plague you with  requests  for  different 
varieties  of  cheese,  which you,  the proprieter or shopkeeper  would 
repudiate with an infinite variety of excuses..

Hesitation  or  repetition on the part of either party gives  the  game 
away to their opponent..  A really good player can keep the thing going 
for  ages,  or  should be in possession of a really nifty kick  to  the 
upper  lip of their opponent if said opponent is too much of  a  smarty 
pants to suffer to live alongside you on this Earth..

Anyway, we at Maggie thought that this scenario could be adapted to the 
(mis)fortunes of Atari and their (non) sales and marketing..

In this modified version,  we are concentrating on the excuses by Atari 
who  are the 'cheese shop' player..  The customer simply has to keep on 
asking  where the Jaguar has got to..  A scoring system to make  things 
slightly easier for the player representing 'Atari' is being devised at 
this moment, and will be incorporated into the end of this textfile..
 
A starter list of excuses for Atari Cheese Shop..

1. Those, we make THOSE!?!?

2. Only  very  clever people have been able to see the message in  our 
   advertising.. (Pityingly)

3. The  last  batch of Jaguars were wired up for the  German  domestic 
   mains supply and are unsafe to use in this country..

4. The  managers  cat has been sick behind the kitchen waste  disposal 
   unit, so he's had to take compassionate leave..

5. Sorry, I DON'T think so!

6. I think you'd be better off with a PlayStation actually..

7. We've got Jaguars, but no Joypads..

8. We'll have to refer that query to head office..

9. You'll  have  to ring up JTS Corp to find out,  they don't tell  us 
   what's going on anymore..

10. Would you like one of our spare Falcons instead?

11. Atari Jaguar? I thought this was the Red Dwarf Book signing venue!

12. There might be some in tomorrow.

13. We're  just the furniture removal company,  Atari have moved their 
    customer service deparment to Luxembourg.. 

14. Try the HMV store down the road, they might still have some..

15. Well  we've MADE the things,  I don't see why you need to BUY one! 
   (Exasperatedly)

16. Well  they  came in yesterday,  but the polystyrene box didn't fit 
    correctly..

17. Ha! I've just sold the last one! 

18. We  thought this batch was okay,  but the plastic casing gives off 
    cancer causing fumes when it heats up, so we had to withdraw it.. 

19. We did have one a month ago, now where is it..

20. No Sprekenzie Englisch!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

And  these twenty should be enough to get a determined  player  going.. 
Anyone  going  for a championship game should sit down with a  pen  and 
paper (or keyboard) and make up some more excuses..

Scoring  system..  For  an  easy  game  stop  at  ten  excuses  without 
hesitation  or repetition for the Atari player to win..  A harder  game 
should run up to twenty excuses, and at championship level with several 
players, the game should not stop until the excuses run out, and points 
are  allocated  for  the number of excuses used  in  that  round..  The 
highest number of points wins..

If you really feel daring,  you could experiment with tight time limits 
for  the  Atari  Player to respond,  strange 'forfeits'  of  a  masonic 
trouser leg raising style, synchronised face slapping, and so on..
