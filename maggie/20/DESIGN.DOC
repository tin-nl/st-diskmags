        Thoughts on demos and design


I found the following three points at  the start of a book called "The
History of Graphic Design" by  Philip  B.  Meggs:  they  are by a very
famous German designer called  Herbert  Bayer.  In themselves they are
some very interesting propositions, but I  started to think about them
in the light of computer program  design, or more specifically, demos.
Of course Herr Bayer wasn't around  when computer demos were invented,
but it tends to hold true for  all  forms  of media anyway. So take it
away, Herbert...

          1. the creative process  is  not performed by the
          skilled hand alone, but must be a unified process
          in  which  "head,   heart,   and   hand   play  a
          simultaneous role."

          2. I quote the Japanese saying, "first acquire an
          infallible technique and  then  open  yourself to
          inspiration."

          3. the human  being  as  a  manifestation  of the
          supreme spirit or  the  source  of life "performs
          what he is given to  do." in the consciousness of
          I of myself can do  nothing  the artist becomes a
          transparency through which the creative principle
          operates.

Confused? So was I. I wanted  to  write  a demo, not become God... and
the punctuation sucks.

The thought that the  artist  can  become  a  "transparency" is a very
impressive one, but an  artist  is  in  all  cases  forced  to use his
faculties to mediate his ideas. In any case, I hate the word "artist",
I  shall  use  "programmer"  from  now   on   to  avoid  a  charge  of
pretentiousness. To say that  a  programmer,  who has to fundamentally
structure the entire workings of a  program, must have a consciousness
of "I can  do  nothing"  is  nonsense.  Hence:  ignore  point  3, it's
rubbish.

So let's try again.

What IS design then? I mean, in a  demo? The name of every other group
nowadays seems to end in "Design" but all I see is pointless frills in
demos. The idea of design is NOT, I  repeat NOT, to put a tiny icon in
the corner of the screen while your Z-Buffer effect takes place. That,
my friends, is PRESENTATION,  not  design:  Presentation  is a part of
design. But then "Lard Presentation" doesn't sound as good, does it?

Is it the music then? Partly, yes, I think it is. An atmospheric piece
adds a great amount to the satisfaction that a demo gives. And here we
stumble upon what design  really  means.  It  is the organisation, the
composition of a piece of  work  that  lends additional value (in this
sense enjoyment) to it. This is my definition.

As I write this, it occurs to  me  that the more we talk about design,
the more we need to talk about  the  meaning of a "demo" too. This may
seem like splitting hairs: to ask "What's a demo?" makes me feel a bit
silly, I admit. "A demo  is  a  series  of technical effects with some
music that will impress the audience"  you  will reply. Er, no, sorry.
That's just what you're used to,  probably because most are written to
get the programmers a job... I am  beginning to feel that demos should
be a bit more than this,  more  than  a  few cheap thrills. A demo can
include whatever you want it to. The main point should be to show what
is possible with a computer, and this is not limited to just technical
effects...

"Bloody Sssshtudents!" I hear you cry  in  a  Paul Calf voice. Maybe I
have been thinking about it too much,  and I admit I have no intention
(or chance) of becoming  a  "real"  games  programmer. But the problem
with demos is really the same  as  the problem that computer games are
experiencing too at the moment  -  technology  is expanding at massive
rates but the style or games  is  remaining  the  same. To use a music
analogy, computing is still stuck  at  the  Big  Band  era - some nice
melodies, but no real edge or passion to it.

Fans of The Edge Magazine  (yes,  they  do  exist!) must begin to feel
increasingly bored when, upon buying their  new  copy, seem to see the
SAME game every issue with the  textures  changed on those Ridge Racer
cars. Where is the simple  excitement  of your ZX-81 Rampack crashing?
The thrill of seeing Horace Goes Skiing or Jetpac for the first time?

It was depressing to read the interviews  in Maggie 19 with two people
who merely used the Atari as a tool rather than for technical interest
or pleasure. I always feel that  they  don't get half as much pleasure
out of a machine than is  possible:  on  the  other hand, they tend to
make wads of money instead. Surely  there  is some way to interest and
impress these people too?

I shall now make my guilty secret known.

What is the best designed Falcon demo? THe answer is not Eko-System or
the Lost Blubb (this is  the  second  best),  or even the Senior Dads'
astonishing and terrific hidden screen  on  Anal Tuck. The best design
is in  "Weltschmerz",  the  demo  that  most  people  found cringingly
embarassing. The demo that you  couldn't  boot  up before 7p.m. in the
evening.

Why is it the best? No, not  because  I know the maker, but because it
had great ideas. The execution wasn't great,  but if you could make it
into a megademo (no mean feat!)  and  improve the English a bit, sorry
Martin, then it ought to wipe the  floor with every demo known to man.
Imagine the spine-tingling ability to combine technology and design to
inspire people, to do something  useful  for  a change, to make people
think? A demo with a bit of passion and sense? Or even just a sense of
humour? (Bit difficult  for  Germans,  I  know)  That  was  what makes
Grotesque so great - still the best demo I've ever seen.

I  still  remember  writing  a  smaller   but  similar  article  in  a
diskmagazine where I complained about Amiga demos being so much better
than Atari ones. I now withdraw  that  statement, becuase Amiga and PC
owners are now so obsessed with  speed, polygons and presentation that
they are missing the real point of it all, which is enjoyment.



Finally, back to the original question. What is "Design"?

Design is the quality of  making  a program significantly greater than
the sum of its parts.

- I think...

Replies would be welcome!






IMPORTANT  NOTE:  the  views  expressed   in   this  article  are  not
necessarily those of the author.  I've  just  read them again and they
sound incredibly pretentious. That's arts students for you eh?
