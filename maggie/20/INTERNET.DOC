The Internet :(  -The truth revealed!(Try and guess what sort  of  mood
I  was  in  when  I  wrote this, Maggie readers!) 


In the last Maggie CIH asked, "Whither the Internet, is it all bollocks
or what?".  Well,  after  spending  an  hour  in my  local Cybercafe  I
have  the  answer-  "Actually,  it's  more  like  Ceefax 2000....." 

Yes! Just as Tempest  2000 is  an old concept  with better graphics and
more features added, the  internet  is actually the same sort of thing,
only done with Teletext.  Years ago when I was little, we got a new TV.
It had a  then  new thing on it  called "Teletext". By pressing buttons
on the remote control you could access hundreds of pages of information
on loads of different subjects. 

As a small child, I was amazed by this and spent  ages flicking through
the pages. After a while though, the novelty wore off. You  had to wait
a while for  the page  to  appear  after you  had selected  it and  the
contents were very brief and bland.  The internet is VERY similar.

If  we're  to be brutally honest, computers  are not  really that  much
use for the average person, the enthusiast market (i.e. us) is not that
big.  This is a major problem for people in the computer business and a
number of approaches have had to be made  to  increase sales.  Every so
often,  a new novelty  is  brought  to the publics'  attention to  sell
computers. Of all the computers ever made, the one  that  has been most
sold on  this premise  is the PC.  Everyone  remembers  the  last "flog
some more PCs" techo-hype, multimedia, which featured incredible things
like sound and pictures together. Once again, the  PC  was  shown to be
20 years behind the  times by  getting people amazed by what videogames
have been doing since 1975.

This  years' hype  is  the internet.  A thing,  we are  told by  TV and 
newspaper  journalists,  that  will  change our lives. Somehow, I don't
think so.  It  will however,  change our bank  balances, in a downwards
direction,  as  we spend  stupid amounts  of money on expensive PC gear
and phone bills. There is  an Internet Cafe near where I live. I hadn't
took much notice of this as I have had my suspicions about the internet
ever  since  all  the  "super information highway" media stuff started,
and  after paying  five quid for  an hours' time on the internet at the
Cybercafe, they have been confirmed.  

From watching television reports on the internet,  you would think that
all you do is type in the address of  your  web page and it all pops up
on the screen. Not so. What actually happens  is  that  you type in the
address you want,  and then you  watch  the  bottom of the screen while
some status messages come up  as to  what's happening as it attempts to
connect to the computer on  the other  end.  I found this took about 10
seconds on average,  sometimes rising to 30 seconds or worse. On trying
to access an FTP site in  France   in  search  of the "Illusion" demo I
gave up waiting after a   minute  and  disconnected in frustration. And
all the time you are paying  for  this  waiting.

When it gets through , the  text is  there almost  immediately but  the
pictures  take a bit more time to download, they appear bit by  bit and 
the  program fills  in  the gaps as it goes so the effect  is something
like  a very low resolution picture with the pixels shrinking until you
get the proper picture.

This is a bit different to what I've  seen on the telly where the page
appears immediately, I think they must have saved the page to disk and
then loaded it in off the disk  for the TV cameras, rather misleading,
I think.  You can of course, download PD from various FTP sites, which
is what really interested me,  but  once again, sluggishness pops its'
head up. My mind was cast back in time to 1983 when I would go down to
visit my mate and we would both  nervously  stare at the TV screen for
minutes on end waiting for  the  games  to  load on his Spectrum. Yup,
files take quite a while to download, and sometimes the transfer stops
for a bit and then continues, making  you look at the screen in panic.

As far as I can see, FTP is  the  only real reason to be interested in
the internet, but given the cost  of  all  the gear needed for it, and
the time it takes to download, plus the  cost of the phone bill, it is
a lot less hassle to get your PD  off a library or a friendly contact.

And when I got my  disks  home,  they  didn't  work. Was some download
setting wrong on the Netscape viewer? I  dunno, and with the amount of
money I was paying for  an  hours'  use  I  didn't  want to spend time
clicking on all the menus to  see  if  everything was set right, and I
certainly won't be going back to waste more money trying again. 

In conclusion,  I  can only  recommend  the internet  to  anyone  only
if you've  got lots  of spare  cash to spend  and are very patient and
don't  expect too  much  out of it.   Contrary to what the media would
have you believe, it will not change your life and is not the greatest
thing since sliced bread. In other words, the internet is:

1) Slow.

2) Superficial.

3) Expensive.

4) Of little real interest (unless  you are fascinated by the way text
   and pictures can  "magically"  appear  on your screen.)

5) Only usable by students who don't  have to pay for it and Americans
   who don't have to pay for local phone calls.

6) And yes Chris, it seems you were right....  Bollocks!

(By the way, isn't "Cybercafe" a stupid phrase? To me, it always brings
to  mind  images of the Cybermen out of  Dr.Who dressed up in waitress'
uniforms  serving at  tables,  mind you, I suppose "Dalekcafe" would be
worse, I  mean,  how would they pour out the tea with only a sucker and
an exterminator gun to wave about....)
