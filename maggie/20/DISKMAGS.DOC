Here  we  are again with an ever later occuring issue of  this  regular 
column..  This  time  around,  we seem to be waiting for ever-prolonged 
issues  of  several  regular publications which have  gone  into  slow-
motion..  Hopefully, DBA issue fifteen should arrive to be written into 
this  column..  ST-News  has gone for a mega-huge final issue in  July, 
which  will be just outside the scope of this issue of Maggie,  if  all 
goes well here..

However,  we  are  able to consider some more publications  which  have 
arrived in the preceding weeks for our consideration.. The latest issue 
of Atari Dream Machine, picked up 'live' at the Symposium convention in 
Hamburg,  a new issue of Skynet Times due *really* soon,  honest,  from 
our  friend  VoGue..  There is also the wholly new and rather  readable 
Atariphile  production  from the Falcon Fact File,  which has gone  all 
HTML  format on us,  and includes some very well-writen and up to  date 
reviews..

First of all,  there is that most pleasing of Diskmag happenings, a new 
publication  which  looks like it is going to make some impact  on  the 
scene  as  a whole..  It manages to be monthly,  has reached its  fifth 
issue  already,  and is honestly one of those diskmags that has managed 
to get better with each isssue..  

Without further ado, I give you..


                          ST Plus Issue Five

There was once a chap in Northampton who had an ST.. He's still got the 
ST,  an  STe  of  the Four Meg persuasion,  in fact..  He used to  like 
nothing  better than playing games..  Some games he got really good at, 
and  one particularly took over a large chunk of his life..  That  game 
was  'Frontier',  and  it gained such a following,  that a diskmag,  the 
'Panther Owners Group' was produced for it.. As far as I know, the only 
diskmag  to be produced off the back of a single game..  Well this chap 
got  involved in the diskmag,  even going as far to write to the author 
of  the  game,  David  Braben to find out where the blinkin'  heck  the 
follow up to Frontier, 'First Encounters' had got to.. 

(It had got to the PC and stuck there..)

Of  course,  this  was in the twilight days of the ST as  a  commercial 
format,  so  it was a case of ' nice letter but nothing doing' from the 
Braben,  and  so P.O.G (the shortened Panther Owners Group) had to  run 
its course..  With loads of time on his hands,  Dave Hollis (it is he!) 
quite fancied doing some more of this diskmag lark, and so, ST Plus was 
born..

The first couple of 'plus's were really a case of learning on the  job, 
and  used  a  competent but nondescript Tony  Greenwood  style  diskmag 
construction kit.. The articles a mixture of random Internet stuff, and 
(increasing) original contributions as well.. From issue three onwards, 
more   people  started  to  take  an  interest,   including  ever  more 
interesting new custom shells from Tony Greenwood, and more articles..

Now  at about issue five,  it is time for ST Plus to be considered as a 
mature production, and so can be reviewed here..

ST  Plus is probably the only current monthly production for the ST  at 
the  moment,  and seems to capture some of the spirit of the heyday  of 
Power  Diskmag  in a broad nutshell definition..  Dave Hollis  is  very 
keen,  and this is all too rare a quality these days.. Dave has assumed 
the  position of an 'everyman' editor,  not knowing too much  (probably 
knowing more than he lets on!) but keen to learn on the job..

The mag starts off with the usual introductions and news..  The welcome 
column  has a novel 'Picture within text' feature as .PI2  mugshots  of 
the cast and crew nestle within the textfile.. This feature of the Tony 
Greenwood text displayer will be discussed more fully shortly.. The mag 
then  goes  onto  a  mixture of news and  views,  readers  letters  and 
adverts.. Thus, suitably informed, you go on..

Dave  has  the good sense to delegate,  so ST Plus is divided  up  into 
several more parts,  including normal (games) reviews,  the odd demo or 
two, and even Jaguar and Lynx stuff.. There is a strong Sci-Fi section, 
a hangover from P.O.G. with a strong Star Trek the various series bias, 
but  Babylon Five and even out takes from the game Frontier make  their 
way  in..  Dave has a strong team including Pete Augustin and even  ex-
Power Mag writer Bryn Jones among others.. 

There is quite a lot of practical material in there, with both STOS and 
assembly  coding sections kept maintained by their various  editors,  a 
Music  and  MIDI  section  too..  About the only  thing  missing  is  a 
dedicated  Falcon Section,  although I have sent the odd article to try 
to  fill  that  gap..  Several other miscellaneous,  articles,  humour, 
netgrabs and the like congregate near to the end..

The  standard of material is generally good and well presented,  with a 
lively cheerful editorial personality bubbling throughout.. Spelling is 
sometimes hit and miss, but that adds to the homebrew fun atmosphere of 
the mag.. A diskmag never needs to take itself too seriously, does it?

Technically,  this  is  a more interesting publication than most  other 
early  stage  productions which don't normally tend to  have  a  custom 
shell  of their own..  This one has a non-GEM custom interface designed 
by  Tony  Greenwood..  The main method of getting to the articles is  a 
scroll  up  and down system common to many publications such  as  Power 
Diskmag,  with  the user clicking on something to select and load in an 
article..  The interface is dual mouse and keyboard driven, so you have 
a choice in how to use it.. The main menu is unadorned and rather plain 
looking, but there seems to be the possibility for pictures in there as 
well for future issues perhaps.. The mouse pointer leaves a nice little 
trail behind it as it moves across the screen.. (Try wiggling it faster 
and faster around the menu..)

The text displayer is modelled on the Tony Greenwood Diskmag/multimedia 
displayer, which allows for quite a lot of different options.. First up 
is the previously mentioned 'picture within text' option.. A picture as 
a  caption  for the text,  or as an illustration brightens up a lot  of 
documents,  including  several articles where messrs Hollis and co seem 
to  have  this  mad fetish for designing space ships,  and plans  of  a 
fictional  ultimate  new generation Enterprise pepper  the  text..  The 
magazine  also has a normal gallery style function for  sixteen  colour 
lo-res pictures..  There is not a background fill as per DBA Mag on the 
Falcon,  but this would take up more diskspace than Dave has got on the 
ST, so this is understandable..There are options from a very large help 
screen  to  change  the fonts for a  textfile,  change  the  background 
colour,  print out,  search for bits of an article,  etc..  The options 
only  keep  for the duration of that textfile,  so if you fancy  a  red 
background  for  all  the text (captioned as the  'Bills  you  hate  to 
get'!),  you  would have to select it all again in the next  textfile.. 
This is but a minor niggle though..

For  a  fully  featured  shell and  displayer  program,  you  might  be 
interested  to know that is has been done in STOS,  otherwise known  as 
the curse of the Falcon..  However,  (and read elsewhere this issue re. 
things  said  by Tony Greenwood) the 'curse of STOS' has  largely  been 
solved,  not least by the Generic STOS fixer being applied all over the 
tender bits of this issue before release to the general public..

Tony  has  made  this shell fixable,  mainly to get over the  TOS  2.06 
incompatibility,   and   reports  from  there  suggest  that  this  has 
succeeded..  To work on the Falcon, it still needs a little extra help, 
but Backwards is equal to the task,  and once in, there are no problems 
to report (CiH - Official Falcon beta-tester)

A reset is still advisable at the end of a session though..

This  issue  of 'Plus is quite well filled,  with  sixty-odd  articles, 
mostly original, and several pictures both in and out of the text.. The 
only  thing  missing  at  this time was the  lack  of  music,  although 
previous  issues  have  featured chip music,  and  the  odd  standalone 
modfile player as well..

One little quibble though, this was the May issue of ST Plus, but has a 
release  date of the 11th April 1996..  Dave Hollis owned up to being a 
bit  temporally  challenged  at  this point,  and  is  currently  stuck 
somewhere in December 1994!
 
Still  the most amazing thing about this mag when you come down to  it, 
is that it manages to be monthly!!

Summary:- Monthly release on one D/S disk..  Advanced STOS custom shell 
and text displayer with some nice features..  Good mix of articles, but 
memorable  for  Atari  specific stuff as well  as  Star  Trek..  Falcon 
compatible  with a bit of help from the premier ST emulator  Backward.. 
Prospects, great, as long as Dave can keep it up..

Overall,  eight  out  of ten..  You can probably work out that we liked 
this diskmag..


                     Atari Dream Machine Issue Six

This German Falcon only publication was briefly touched on in the  last 
issue of Maggie,  and having produced a sixth issue, perhaps deserves a 
closer look than it got last time around..  

I had the good fortune of meeting the editor at the Symposium, and Timo 
(such shameless name dropping!) kindly gave me a copy of this issue  to 
review..  Certainly from a closer examination, it does seem to be quite 
a  competently  produced magazine with both the Falcon  and  Jaguar  in 
mind..

The  mag program kicks in with a slightly cheesy intro as  the  booming 
chords  of  the 20th Century Fox theme echo around  a  hi-res  'flicker 
vision' rendered picture.. That bit over, we are taken to the main menu 
where  a vision of VGA heaven (and RGB hell!) is handed over to  us  on 
the  main  menu  screen..  You get a page of text with some  some  icon 
controls  at  the bottom,  but a lot of the input is done  through  the 
keyboard..  The  presentation is reminiscent of that paragon of how not 
to do a commercial diskmag 'STampede',  where a pseudo notepad style is 
used to get the text across..

There  is no system as such to select articles,  as all the text in ADM 
has  been bound together into one huge textfile.  There is a  selection 
system for browsing different bits of the text,  as one icon allows for 
a  keyboard  input  of  a  page number which  then  takes  you  to  the 
appropriate  'page' or part of the text..  There is a list of  contents 
right  at the beginning,  which is your map to the rest of the  issue.. 
Alternatively,  you  can  read  it  through,  page by  page,  from  the 
beginning through to the end..  There are no fancy options for the text 
displayer,  which  is  just a standard system text on white  background 
with a flickery hi-res display, which didn't really need to be hi-res.. 
Music is provided with a four channel modfile of good quality..

Textually,  the  magazine  is definitely for hardened users  of  German 
only,  as  it is produced with the larger German Falcon scene in mind.. 
From  what  I grasped of the text,  the contents were well written  and 
informative,  with all the current news of the period in there (Release 
date  17.3.96)..  The 'on the ball-ness' quality can be assessed by the 
fact  that the Double Bobble Xmas levels,  exclusive to Maggie 19,  are 
mentioned in their review of Double Bobble! Not too shabby at all..

The magazine contains a healthy flow of Falcon and Jaguar reviews, with 
several games for both systems in there..  Also Falcon demos,  and news 
of forthcoming scene parties such as the Symposium.. There is a section 
for Falcon hardware modifications,  and a smallish news section..  Some 
netgrabs,  especially  in  the area of press releases are present,  but 
most of the mag is original text..

The  magazine  seems  to have a promising future,  as a  revamped  menu 
should  be produced for issue seven and onwards (which will  cater  for 
the RGB users?) , and the coverage of the Falcon and Jag as provided by 
the  ADM team seems to be well thought out and properly written..  Pity 
then that it is a German only prog..

Summary:-  Falcon  only  publication on one H/D disk..  'As  and  when' 
release,  probably  bi-monthly or quarterly..  Hi-res custom shell with 
GEM  or  system components..  Articles German only,  but good spread of 
news  and  reviews..  Prospects,  okay,  but better if they expanded to 
other parts of the European scene as the Falcon does not simply stop in 
Germany..

Overall, about six and a half, going on seven out of ten..
  

                              Atariphile

Something you can expect to see a lot more of in the next few months as 
the  HTML  format  becomes  very popular to  work  with  among  certain 
people..

The Falcon Fact File have been producing a HTML based newsletter for  a 
little while now,  with regular updates to it.. Now Atariphile seems to 
go  quite a bit further in becoming a fully fledged bi-monthly  diskmag 
based on this system..
 
The  reason for taking this approach seems to be compatibility,  as the 
Crystal Atari Browser (CAB) is now widely available, even to the extent 
of  being  given away on the ST Format cover disk..  CAB is of  course, 
compatible  with  all  Ataris,  high  and  low,  and  this  means  that 
Atariphile  is a true cross platform magazine..  We don't even need  to 
mention using that shuddersome PC thingy with its Netscape browser, but 
there you go, if needs must..

Atariphile  is  best appreciated off-line,  as with all Web pages,  the 
reading process can take some time.. CAB is quite a good system, but is 
really best with a higher res display,  and would be delirious with joy 
if  you  gave it 256 colours to play with..  The HTML format  can  give 
impressive results, with a picture in text system that makes the Web so 
distinctive, but it can lead to some slowing down of the system, as you 
can  wait for some time whilst the pages are set up..  Slow loading  of 
some of the bigger reviews is apparent,  even from a hard drive,  so it 
must be hell to use from floppy!

However,  when  all  is  said and done,  just kick in a tune from  your 
favourite background .ACC modfile player and you are off..

The  contents  really do shine here,  as several articles  and  reviews 
feature  strongly..  Several  long and informative reviews  of  current 
killer apps for the Falcon,  such as Geneva 4,  MagiC 4, and the System 
Solutions Blowup FX expander are all in here..  Kev Beardsworth putting 
in  a  personalised and interesting report on the Blowup  FX  board  in 
particular..  The  writing is all of the best quality and would not  be 
out  of place for a glossy paper mag such as the (sadly  missed)  Atari 
World.. 

Quite a bit of current news and views are in there too,  and some quite 
detailed  reports of alternative events such as the  Aggressive  Party, 
written  by  one Neil Jones-Rodway,  otherwise seen in our  own  Maggie 
Symposium  report  (signed  as Arnel!) He also  wrote  a  comprehensive 
ProTOS show report as well..  Several other headings of a club news and 
small-ads nature bulk out the rest of the mag..

Generally, Atariphile is a publication worth following as it represents 
the best of the serious amateur end of the scene, with several articles 
that could be placed in a professional quality publication..  Worth the 
diskspace you give to your HTML browser.. Get it now!

Summary:- HTML-based publication, intended mainly for Falcon users, but 
with  odd  bits of ST related news filtering  in..  Bi-Monthly  release 
(this is the April issue..) Distributed online, but fits on to standard 
D/D  or  H/D type disk for spreading purposes..  Compatible  with  just 
about  anything  that can run a Web Browser..  Articles  all  extremely  
well-written and relevant to Atari computing with a heavy Falcon bias.. 
Prospects,  rather  promising as frustrated ex-staff writers for  Atari 
World make their mark here..

Overall:- A rather emphatic eight out of ten..


                               Warp Five

Another  overdue  but  welcome publication from the man  Keefy  as  his 
latest  Trek  related  diskzine hits the mailsack..  (Or  not  perhaps, 
according  to Keefy who seems to have a "Hate-hate  relationship"  with 
his local sorting office..) 

Anyway,  this  one  is  up to the high standards set by  the  preceding 
issues,  with  a large spread of high-quality writings culled from  the 
internet..  Several  regular  stories  continue,  with the  endings  to 
several  of  these,  including the final part of the excellent  Dr  Who 
crossover story,  'Doctor and the Enterprise', and also the last of the 
epic  'Darkest  Days'..  (According  to Keefy,  he has dozens of  these 
stories, apparently many rejected by Paramount, the fools!

Several  interviews,  trivia,  and  quite  a lot of (fairly good)  Trek 
related humour also go in,  several respondents to the Warp reader poll 
show  a wide range of people who read it (and who seem to be even  more 
fanatically  loyal  to  their  ST's  than  the  rest  of  us!)  Another 
interesting departure is an informative article on model making of  the 
various Space Ship kits (not as easy as it might seem on the surface!)

The  shell  program has an easy feel of familiarity about  it,  and  is 
modelled on the inevitable fascia panel from a navicom computer on  the 
(Next Generation) Enterprise..  This one is in a nicely restrained blue 
colour scheme,  as the only complaint that Keefy received from a reader 
was  his  alleged  'palette  blindness'  that  normally  only  afflicts 
Scandinavian demo crews, and resulted in some (allegedly) yuccky colour 
schemes in previous issues.. 

The  major  innovation  for this issue,  is that it is  finally  Falcon 
friendly..  Thank you very much!! It just needs to run from ST Low from 
the  desktop,  and  will happily quit and let you carry on  using  your 
Falcon right afterwards.. Very well done! Even the slightly crackly but 
spaciously atmospheric samples are present on the Falcon too.. The only 
thing  that the sound sub-system is left waiting in 'warp'  mode  after 
quitting,  so  something  like 'Falcon SX' is a good idea to clear  the 
sound  sub-system  afterwards..  That small niggle aside,  a very  good 
result from Keefy and co..

Not a lot else to say,  as you will be familiar with this magazine from 
previous reviews in Maggie.. It only remains to finish this review..

Summary:-  Specialist Star Trek related fanzine on D/S disk  with  neat 
STOS  custom  shell..  'As and When' release,  say about three or  four 
issues a year.. Falcon compatible (at last!) and better at it than most 
in fact..  Large supply of relevant textfiles,  over a meg on this disk 
so  plenty  to see..  Prospects,  looks like this can keep going for  a 
while yet..

Overall:- Up there with eight out of ten still..

------------------------------------------------------------------------

             Diskmag News - All the news unfit to print..

Skynet  Times is dead!!  - Official..  Issue eight will not be released 
after all, and the mag will be closed down by VoGue.. Reasons given for 
the closure by VoGue mainly concern a lack of interest in the mag..  He 
is unhappy with the lack of a proper custom made shell,  and feels that 
there is not enough of a readership to justify keeping it going.. Also, 
his  successful venture online with the 'Atari Net Locator'  Web  pages 
is taking up most of his hobby time with the ST,  so basically,  if you 
want to get VoGue in the future, it will have to be online..

The  Magazine  is  not totally lost to posterity  though  as  the  best 
articles  from  the unreleased issue eight will appear in a  number  of 
places,  including this issue of Maggie,  some others in issue seven of 
'ST Plus' and also various things from the mag will be embedded in  the 
'Net Locator Pages too..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ST Plus should have followed up their issue five release with issue six 
due out on the 17th June..  Our issue five observations should be valid 
for  this one as well,  although we've yet to see a full complement  of 
articles  here..  The major addition is a very pretty main menu picture 
which corrects the one deficiency of issue five.. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maggie  'Web Pages are up and running at last!!  These can be found  on 
the Stosser Software Homepage site, otherwise known as:- 

'http://www.airtime.co.uk/users/stosser/home.htm'

The main menu comes up with options for Stosser Software and  Diskmags, 
just  click on the diskmags button,  and then the Maggie button,  along 
with several others is there..  Just click away..  The Maggie pages are 
best  viewed in 256 colour mode as the graphics look shite  otherwise.. 
We share webspace with others such as Warp,  Stosser Mag,  and ST Plus, 
and  there  are  links to the Magnetic  Interlude  Homepage,  and  Pure 
Bollocks Diskmag among others..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There  will  be a Stosser Twenty Seven after all,  in spite of  earlier 
fears that the magazine might have stopped for good..
