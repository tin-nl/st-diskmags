                               By Toons

      (Who may be recognisable to some people as the Megabusters)

A nice little Falcon demo that popped up in the latter part of May, and 
it was made by (ex?) members of the Megabusters, who were last heard of 
on their 1994 release, 'Lametro'.

Yepyha  does not set out to mindboggle in the trail blazed by  EKO  and 
Lazer  et  al,  but  instead follows a traditional French  approach  to 
these matters, otherwise known as 'Design Rules!' Or some nice but seen 
before effects dressed up with several frilly bits around the sides..

The  first bit is rather clever,  probably the best attempt to  deceive 
the  viewer into thinking that their Falcon has mutated into  a  cheapo 
portable  telly that is not tuned into any station,  as the 'static' on 
screen and the attempts to shift the volume up have been done extremely 
well..

This  false  intro  over,  the  proper start screen comes  on,  with  a 
fullscreen  'Toons'  logo and the star of the  soundtrack..  The  first 
effect is a copy of one seen in DNT's 'Chaos AD' demo,  with a spinning 
necklace of lightsourced circles onscreen.. A little 3-D vector polygon 
starts in a tiny hole in the middle of the screen, then expands to fill 
it,  and  shows  off the fact that it is a little bit fancy  and  light 
sourced..
 
Another  bit of 'design',  as the snail in the corner has replaced  the 
purple box,  but it is still the same sort of thing..  The real meat of 
the screen is contained in some solid polygons that are gouraud  shaded 
which catwalk across this screen briefly..

The next screen contains a name very familiar to the Maggie  production 
team,  that is, a sad looking bunny called Ripley! Apart from the name, 
it bears no response to our Ripley,  but is subjected to the indiginity 
of having a couple of distorting viewers dragged across it..  The first 
is  a bouncing glass globe along the lines of the 'Bound demo'  series, 
with  'Ripley'  reflected on its surface..The second is  a  glass  flat 
plate which magnifies Ripley, apart from the bit of the magnifier that 
has  been  cut  out so some of the image  remains  normal  size..  Very 
confusing..

The final major screen is a nice one,  with a fullscreen rendered piccy 
recognisable  from  a French animated series about a bunch  of  insects 
that  think  they are the Thunderbirds or something  (strictly  Channel 
Four Sunday morning fodder,  but nice graphics all the same..) This has 
a  transparent  cube whizzing around and distorting those bits  of  the 
picture it can get its little cubey hands all over..

The  music  changes,  and  we  are onto the final bit of  the  demo,  a 
continually  scrolly greets screen..  The music has gone from cute,  to 
extremely cute, and needs the reset button to finally dispose of it..

Ratings..

Graphix:-  85% - Cuteness is all with some nice little bits and  pieces 
in the screens, nicely drawn cute furry creatures, rendered screen etc, 
all extremely well presented..

Sonix:-  76% - Two modfiles,  trying to outdo each other in  cuteness.. 
The  resulting  bloodshed can be distressing for a younger  viewer,  so 
don't let them listen..

Gee-Whiz:-  68% - Not too much new going on here..  Clever pseudo telly 
effect at the start..

Overall:- 80% - Another of those little demos bursting with  niceness.. 
One to show your granny without risk of her heart bursting,  going into 
premature labour etc..
