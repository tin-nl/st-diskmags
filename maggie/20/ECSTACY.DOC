                                  Ecstacy 1 - By ICE.

                                   Review by Yahoo

                                       STE ONLY


 Methinks that before I continue I ought to make it as clear as...ice...that  I 
know nothing about coding however, I *do* know a great demo when I see one...or 
in this case two.

  I'll go with the flow and talk a little about Ecstacy 1 ('coz there  are  two 
Ecstacy demo's y'see),  Ecstacy 1 (E1) is everything you could want in a  demo, 
the first thing that kicks in is an excellent soundtrack,  not even a 'beep' of 
chip  musix to be found,  a nice start to what turns out to be a thumping  good 
demo, pity though it's the same music...continuously throughout.

  A  few 3D shapes jump onto the screen with  amazing  speed,  though  probably 
optimized  to  hell  and back the speed that some of the shapes  move  is  very 
impressive to say the least,  onward as ever (as demo's do) to some  stunningly 
attractive  plasma type FX,  (I'm afraid that if yer after some  techno  wibble  
with precice name for these FX then yer outta luck, I ain't got a clue...).

  I  noticed as I watched that although ICE tried his hardest  to  install  the 
illusion  of  a borderless demo sometimes it was glaringly  obvious,  take  for 
example  the  'real  world'  section,  a  luurrvly  shaded  3D  scape  with  no 
borders.....that  is  until  the screen swings around and in  the  process  the 
buildings  decide to vanish into oblivion about an inch away from the  edge  of 
the  T.V./monitor  screen,  oh well,  this 'unfortunate' effect was kept  to  a 
minimal so no real points lost there,  as is usual there is a little 'personal' 
coding thrown in for good measure,  in E1's case a swedish flag gets the screen 
for a few seconds,  a little self indulgent perhaps but why the hell  not,  ICE 
are swedish....and proud of it.....

 Onto the credits which I assume were placed in the middle of the demo for  the 
sole purpose of making sure everyone knows who coded what,  once again a little 
self indulgent,  in this case I would rather see the credits at the end,  after 
all,  if you like a demo THAT much your gonna want to stick around to find  out 
who it was that created it....arn't you?...Techwave for example was the man who 
created the muzax...for that alone I would have waited untill the VERY end.

 Moving ever onwards,  a little swing around lightsourcing to please the eye's, 
though not as visually stunning as the plasma type FX,  you have to  appreciate 
the time it takes to code this sort of thing,  once this is understood you  can 
then go on to relax and be entertained.

 One of my favourite FX are some fantastic 'morphing,  trailing vector grafix', 
these  3D vectors quite literally 'morph' from shape to shape with the kind  of 
smoothness  that would shame guiness,  once more some  brilliant  coding....and 
just  for  those of you who have a facination with seeing famous peeps  in  the 
nuddy,  the morphing is followed by a rather attractive picture of Paula  Abdul 
in  her  birthday  suit.....albeit  greyscale,  fade from  this  to  some  real 
programming  skill,  3 Axis,  3 balls....512 dots EACH,  once  more,  all  very 
smooth.

  The final part of E1 covers a little more cube rotation and from  there  your 
treated to some unbelievable SINE DOTS....17800 of 'em and ALL in 50Hz.


 How can I round up this demo without repeating myself....?....simple, I can't, 
E1  shows you just what can be done with a lot of time and  effort,  though  in 
places there could have been room for improvement this demo promises to be  one 
that's around for years...mabey decades to come (well,  I ain't gettin' rid  of 
MY ST, I don't know about you...).

 One point of interest to note if your interested in demo's and you haven't yet 
graced your disk box with E1 (or E2) is that there is NOTHING that's   repeated 
continually,  also, everything  is so timed that you are given long  enough  to 
enjoy  a  particular  piece of code but it's not so long  as  your  getting  it 
crammed into your eye's,  personally, I think about 20 seconds maximum is quite 
long enough to spend watching a particular effect,  after all, once you've seen 
something once you don't want to sit for too long thinking...'yeah...and?'.


                            So, how'd'it do you say.
                            ************************

Grafix ---------- 8/10 (some  very competent coding....but then what  else  can 
you expect from ICE, let down once or twice but what the hell).

Music ----------- 9/10 (Mr.Techwave...take a bow).

Value for money - 10/10 (It's PD.....innit).

Staying power --- 10/10 (this one's gonna outlive ME).

                                  Ecstacy 2 - By ICE.

                                    Review by Yahoo


 Hmmm,  somewhat of an anti-climax this once,  if anything I would suggest that 
if your lucky enough to get both E1 and E2 together then watch E2 first,  think 
of it as an intro to Ecstacy rather than a sequel to E1,  trust me, it's better 
that way.

 Here we start of with some great musax....pity it came right from the belly of 
E1,  still,  I  like  the music so I didn't mind too much  (though  originality 
scores...).

 On then to a scroller......oh boy,  if your prone to headaches then close your 
eye's for this one, a 'zoomer' super fast scrolly to be sure, if you ain't well 
versed  in speed reading then I would suggest you video this demo and pause  it 
later  for the bit's your likely to miss (and you will...I promise),  in all  a 
very effective scroller if a little hard on the 'ol peepers.

  Ahhh,  now then,  perhaps ICE though about the scroller after all 'coz  after 
eyeball hell comes eyeball heaven, some beautiful stars.....nope, not the white
dots on a black background type stars but some very smooth yellow type coloured 
stars,  everyone doing what it's told be forming some nice patterns and the odd 
'it's by ICE' message......not that we didn't know that already but again, what 
the hell, ICE dunnit....ICE ego trip...

  The  rest  of  the  demo consists primarily  of  filled  polygons  with  some 
impressive striped running through them,  the odd screen shows just what the ST 
is capable of in that your treated to polygons INSIDE polygons....with  stripes 
(who  needs aquafresh eh?), a  little fade  into one of the last screens,  more 
stars residing inside a 3D vector box, all of which is rotating around in  very 
'ICE' type fashion.

  Towards the end of E2 I noticed that the screen was flashing to the  beat  of 
the  musax,  why  I  don't know,  this can be VERY effective in  the  dark  but 
otherwise....pass,  a few more filled,  lined polygons (with one shape  passing 
more  than a resemblence to a PYTHON freighter (from  Elite/Frontier),  finally 
it's back to the 'screw yer eye's up' scroller,  words like PEACE...LOVE....AND 
HARMONY...are the last headaches...(opps, I mean words) to grace the screen and 
thus doeth the end come'eth....

  Having  said earlier that this was/is a bit of a let down let me  assure  you 
I've  got some....proggies (to call them demo's is insulting to be  sure)  that 
are  totally  erased by the likes of E2,   while not as  polished  or  visually 
pleasing as E1,  E2 still remains a permanent fixture in by disk box, you could 
do a lot worst than to include it in yours....

 Once more unto the ratings bit...


Grafix ---------- 6/10 (it's NOT E1.....but 'tis rather good though).

Music ----------- 10/10 (Mr.Techwave...take a bow....again).

Value for money - 10/10 (Once more, it's PD.....innit).

Staying power --- 5/10 (There's  not so much  to keep  your interest  this time 
around).
