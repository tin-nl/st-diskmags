                             CROUR 96KTRO
                             ============

Crour are a relatively new coding  team who are currently busy working
on some nice Falcon games. This is a rare demo from them and a welcome
entry to the disappointing symposium 96ktro competition.

The demo starts badly with a  terrible  fire effect. The screen is set
into a really low resolution, and  a  fire  effect is attempted but it
really looks nothing like fire. Especially when compared with what can
be done in 4K, this is a very poor effort. I can only assume that this
screen wasn't finished and they had to meet a deadline.

Next a nice Crour logo  scrolls  up  the  screen.  A raster splits the
screen giving the illusion of water, and the logo is reflected in this
water. If you have seen  any  ST  demo,  you'll  be familiar with this
effect. Still, its good to  see  that  some  effort  has gone into the
presentation.

The next effect is very nice,  although  I  suspect  there is a lot of
cheating going on. It is a sort  of tunnel effect, a texture is mapped
around a tunnel and  around  three  cylinders  the  head  off down the
tunnel. Everything rolls about at a frightening pace for a true colour
full screen. The  screen  is  actually  quad-symetrical, this probably
being the key to its  speed.  This  screen  is reasonably original and
very well presented. Good stuff.

Next up is a piece of Zweckform  graphics  - this time a scantily clad
young lady. Very scantily indeed. At  least  this  gave us a chance to
learn a new  German  word  -  "titten".  (work  it  out for yourselves
Windows 95 users).

The demo then finishes with a great  end screen. The credits scroll up
the screen, but not in a boring  linear fashion, they are pulled up as
a wave goes through them.  Behind  the  nice  font hundreds of bubbles
float up the screen. This  screen  is  exquisitely presented and is my
favourite in the demo.

It is good to see that a  lot  of  effort has been put into this demo,
especially on the presentation side  of  things.  It  may not have the
best technical effects, but it looks great  - and for that matter - it
actually looks like a real demo.  Crour  have  come up with the goods,
this is the best 96ktro of the bunch.
