                         A 96KTRO BY TRANTOR

Trantor's  contribution  to  the  96k  competition  left  the  viewing
audience vastly underwhelmed. To say this  demo is average would be an
insult to average demos. Let us examine the facts.

The demo opens with a  "TRANTOR"  logo  wobbling  about. This is a one
colour white logo doing a sinewave  distortion and looks like a 1plane
bit bender, a quite tricky effect  to  achieve. In fact, the screen is
running in true colour mode so the effect is a piece of cake. Why they
couldn't have livened it up  by  adding  some  more colours, disting a
proper logo or even interpolative shading it, I don't know.

After "presents" and "TRANTOR" are wobbled  about  in the same way, we
are into the proper part of the demo.  And boy, do we wish we weren't!
A couple of  squares  hang  uncomfortably  in  the  top corner, trying
desparately to be  "design"  and  failing  dismally.  An unspectacular
Trantor logo lounges in the bottom right  corner. In the middle of the
screen the "effect" takes place.

The effect starts badly, trails off  in  the middle and the least said
about the end  the  better.  It  begins  with  a  zooming texture. The
picture, which looks a very badly  deformed female face, zooms in from
the centre of the screen and back out again. The detail on the picture
is so low that it very quickly  becomes blocky and distorted. It looks
like you using the magnify function  on  God-Paint, only it is running
slower and with less  detail.  At  this  point  you  begin to get very
worried.

Then the main effect appears.  The  picture  rotates! Around one axis!
Very slowly! With lots  of  distortion!  This  is  truly terrible. The
picture becomes so badly  distorted  it  is almost unrecognisable, the
lines of rotation seem to  be  badly  askew  and the whole thing looks
truly dreadful. You begin to wonder if they are being serious.

The next effect is a plasma colour cycle, which admittedly looks quite
nice. Unfortunately they forgot to cycle the whole palette and you get
some rather unsightly blotches.

The credits then scroll up the  screen  and you feel an enormous sense
of relief that the demo  has  finished  and  you  can close this whole
painful chapter of your  life.  The  music  may  have been a redeeming
feature if it wasn't for the fact  that  it  is four years old and not
much cop.

Thinking I may have been a bit harsh, and the demo may have been coded
in a restrictive high  level  language  -  perhaps  COBOL  - I quickly
disassembled it. My worst fears  were  confirmed,  it was machine code
but possibly the  worst  piece  of  programming  I've  seen since some
people decided to write an operating system  for the amiga and call it
"workbench".

So there we have it. BUGS.  If  this  review  was being carried out by
Paul Calf I think he would sum up  with  "Bug of shite". All I can say
is that the Senior Dads now have some serious competition.
