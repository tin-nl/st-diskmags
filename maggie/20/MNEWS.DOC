                                ----------------

[] SKY-FALL DESCENDS!

Top Falcon games coding  team  The  Reservoir  Gods  have completed their latest
game. Entitled Sky-Fall it is a multiplayer arcade  style puzzle game for 1 to 4
players. Featuring true colour graphics and  thumping  techno music it is one to
get your hands on.
Those of you registering will get an  extra  bonus. Mr. Pink tells Maggie "Yeah,
we have done a special remix for registered users. This contains eight new ghost
effects - and some  of  these  are  pretty  damn  vicious!  There are also sound
samples which feature my voice, and yeah I do really sound like that."
Reports that Mr. Pink has been offered a job  as a presenter on Radio 4 have yet
to be confirmed.

[] IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD (AS WE KNOW IT)

Hi quality atari magazine "Atari  World"  has  recently  folded. The collapse of
Compo, one of its main financial backers, was fatal. This is a great shame as it
was a brilliant magazine written by real  enthusiasts. We hope that some way may
be found to resurrect it.

[] EVERYTHING IS TRON

French coder Synax is busy working  on  a  Tron  style game for the Falcon. This
will be a multiplayer game for up to  six  players and have many options such as
teams, shields and speed icons.

[] KELLY ON CODING

English coder and student  of  software  engineering  at John Moores University,
Andrew Kelly, is busy working on two Falcon games. The first is a Wolfenstein-3D
style game and the second is a  racing  game  based on Daytona USA. Andrew tells
Maggie "they are both running in 16 colour  mode  at the moment so don't look so
good, but I am hoping to switch to 256 colour mode".

[] DUTCH ADO ABOUT NEUROBOTIX

Dutch software development team  Earchaepterix  Software  are  busy working on a
Falcon game. "NEUROBOTIX" is a platform  based  arcade  game which is about 75%.
Main coder Pieter van der Meer  tells  Maggie "Neurobotix is a hi-tech scrolling
platformer in 256-colours. I coded everything  in assembler, so it's pretty fast
(15-20hz)." Neurobotix should be released this summer.

[] TATS AWAY (I LIKE IT)

Lancastrian coder and fan of sleeping on Falcons, Tat, has quit top coding group
Digital Chaos. In a storm of  controversy  he  is  believed to have shouted "Sod
this, I'm off down the pub"  (or  words  to  that  effect). The other members of
Digital Chaos were unavailable for comment  as  they had all previously left the
group. Tat has now joined top German coding and farting team "Avena".

[] RESPECT YOUR ZELDAS

French coding team Tool 8 technologies  are  busy  working on a number of Falcon
games. Graphics artists Hades tells Maggie  that  their  first release will be a
"Zelda style game". Plans for  a  Wolf-3D  clone  have  been put on hold though.
Expect screenshots and a full preview  of  Tool  8's  Zelda in the next issue of
Maggie.

[] MR EKO GO TO HELL

Top French 3D coding wizards EKO have  left  the Falcon demo scene. They are now
working professionally and so there will  probably  never  be a follow up to the
immense "Eko-System" demo. We hope their games will be finished and we wish them
good luck in all their future projects.

[] NAS - THE WORLD IS YOURS

The Nordic Atari Show 1996 was  held  in  Gothenborg from June 14-16. Members of
the  Reservoir  Gods  were  invited   but  unfortunately  financial  constraints
prevented us from attending (maybe next  time  eh?). Competitions were set to be
held for small Falcon demos, main demos and there was also a world cup in typing
the letters A-Z in the quickest  time.  This looked like an excellent convention
and we are very sorry to miss  it.  We  will bring reports on the convention and
demos released in the next issue of Maggie.

[] WHEN SATURNE 3 COMES

The Saturne Party 96 was held in Paris from April 26-28. Although this wasn't an
Atari specific party, it did have a Falcon section and many of the French people
who missed the Symposium  attended  this  party.  We  hope  to  have news of any
Saturne 3 releases in the next issue of Maggie.

[] CARNAGE

French Atari supporters "Techno Service" are busy  working on a car game for the
Falcon. According to graphics artist Flan,   "Radical  Race" is a car-crash race
game which runs in true colour mode  with  many sound effects. It is multiplayer
and runs at 50 frames a second.  We  should  receive a full preview for the next
issue of Maggie.

[] OVER THE MOON

News of the follow up to  French  racing  game Moonspeeder reaches Maggie. It is
called "Moongames". No other details are yet known, but rumours that it features
"Mr. Spoon" on his legendary trip to "Button Moon" have been discounted.

[] LOONY DUNES

Frontier Software will soon be  selling  the  art  package DGRAPH. Coded by Evil
Metal of demo team "Dune",  the  software  resembles  the classic ST art package
Neochrome but has more powerful features.

[] CEREBRAL CORSAIR

Swedish coding team Impulse are busy working  on a new Falcon game. "Corsair" is
a conversion of a commodore 64 game, but has been brought into the 90s with lots
of extras and power ups. For more information check out the previews section.

[] DEAD OF THE CLASS

Fellows Swedes "Dead Hackers  Society"  have  completed  at last completed their
award winning demo. "Demolition" scooped the top prize at the Aggressive 2 party
and has finally been released. For a review see elsewhere in the issue.

[] DEVPAC YOUR BAGS

German coding group are busy working  on  an  assembler. The Avena Assembler can
tokenise lines rather  like  turbo  assembler,  but  supports  the  entire 68030
instruction set and has a  rather  neat  interface.  Could  this  be the end for
Devpac? (Find out more in our  regular  soap opera "The Assemblers", an everyday
tale of code generating tools).

[] EVERYTHING SHIRTS

The lucky person who is the  100th  to  register for a Reservoir Gods production
will receive a special bonus. Mr. Pink tells Maggie "In total we have had around
90 registrations for all productions and we  want to reward our 100th registree.
We have printed some very smart Reservoir  Gods T-Shirts with a logo designed by
Sparehead 3. The 100th person to register will get one of these T-Shirts free of
charge!". What a nice man.

[] TRES (RIB)BON


French coding team Ribbon are  busy  working  on  a  demo.  A lot of effects are
finished and early reports say that it is  very impressive. Even though a lot of
routines have their basis  in  GFA,  it  apparently  outdoes  a  lot of assembly
efforts! Certainly one to watch out for.

[] MOTION WHERE?

Aggression have promised us that  their  amazing  "Motion" demo will be released
this summer. We are keeping are  fingers  crossed,  but  we have been waiting so
long that even British Rail seems efficient in comparison!

[] TAKE TAT (AGENT T REMIX)

Tat is currently working with Avena on  a  demo  that promises to be the best on
the Falcon yet. The DSP  will  feel  the  strain  of  lots of nifty effects with
stonking music courtesy of Tommy of Avena. The  demo will be designed by Agent T
of Cream, with a Tat remix.

[] THE JOY OF TEXT

The Reservoir Gods are currently working on an adventure game. Mr. Pink explains
"Ripley was very keen to do an adventure game with lots of dark atmosphere, rich
descriptions and lots of intriguing puzzles.  I've coded an adventure system for
the Falcon which she can use to  make  the adventure." Mr. Pink was tight lipped
about the actual plot for the  adventure  but  revealed  "It  will be a bit of a
chiller, but with some humorous elements".

[] ALL ABOARD

Titan designs have created a  new  upgrade  board  for the Falcon. The "Nemesis"
board upgrades the CPU, DSP, FPU and  the  system  bus to give a big increase in
performance. This allows  the  Falcon  to  display  high  resolution true colour
screens on VGA monitors.

[] MEDIA CHANGE

Meanwhile work continues on Apex 3. This  will  include a whole set of new tools
including alpha-mapping (transparency) and mip-mapping for smoothly anti-aliased
graphics. Apex 3 will also support the new Nemesis board.

[] LAZER BLASTED

Plans for the new  Lazer  demo  were  destroyed  when  coder Photon's hard drive
crashed. His new 3D DSP engine was lost  forever. This is a shame because we had
seen some previews of the effects and they were very nice. Some effects may turn
up in an Absence or Independent demo.

[] THE MOON IS MADE OF CREAM CHEESE

Rival demo teams from France and Germany have got together to produce one of the
most exciting Falcon games  yet.  X-Moon  is  a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up
with graphics by Dan/Lazer and Agent T of  Cream. The coding is by Dragon of New
Trend with design by BDC/Aura. Music is  by  Domm/Animal Mine. Look for the full
preview elsewhere in the issue.

[] MODEM LIFE IS RUBBISH

Swedish crew The Black Lotus are busy creating a bulletin board system. They are
also finishing their "To The Hilt" demo.  Tolmo  of BL tells Maggie that the BBS
program is  "a  complex  BBS  system  for  the  Falcon  computer  only".  Sounds
interesting.

[] THE TEXT PHILES


Issue two of the  Falcon  Fact  File's  magazine  "AtariPhile"  has just hit the
streets. The magazine is in HTML format and can be read with CAB or browsed from
their WWW  site.  AtariPhile  2  contains  reviews  of  E-Copy,  Sky-Fall, Magic
Utilities, reports from the Symposium 96  and  also  an assortment of News, Post
and hints and tips. Well worth a look. Web junkies can log on at:

[] THE NEED FOR SPEED (DEPACKING)

Prolific French GFA fans, Ribbon, are busy  working  on a packer. Here at Maggie
we have seen an early version and we  are very impressed. The speed of depacking
has to seen to be believed!

[] KEEP ON RUNNING

German coding group STAX are putting the  finishing touches to their Doom clone.
Entitled "Running", it is the  best  looking  version  of  this  game to hit the
Falcon and easily the most  playable.  This  looks  like  buying a must buy. See
elsewhere in Maggie for a full preview.

[] I FOUGHT THE CRUOR

Symposium 96k heroes Cruor  are  busy  finishing  off  their  debut Falcon game.
"Panium Disaster" is a vertically scrolling true  colour shoot-em up with a nice
rendered intro sequence using NeoN.  The  game  looks  good  but will face stiff
competition from X-Moon.
