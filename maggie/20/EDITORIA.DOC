      Otherwise known as the most self-indulgent bit of the mag..
   
Flamin' June, er July  whatever,  and another issues of Maggie is here
for your education and enjoyment,   or 'edutainment' if you prefer the
crud-speak of software marketing people. Which we don't, of course..

Only approx five months in the making,  and damn late as usual,  but we 
needn't worry about that.. Lots of things have happened in the last few 
months,  some good, some excellent, and one or two utter shite, sort of 
like life in general really.. Here are some of them now..

Atari World Collapse..
A  great monthly mag set up by Compo Software and the ex  Atari  Review 
team,  a winning formula you might think..  Not if you want to make any 
money  at  it,  it seems.. We are back to just ST Format and  what  the 
diskmags provide, the same position we were in early last year..  

ST Plus..
However,  a new monthly diskmag has appeared which relieves some of the 
gloom..  ST Plus is a geniune monthly diskmag,  and it is evolving into 
quite  a  decent quality publication as well..  More on the mag can  be 
found  in  our  diskmags regular column..  The mag can be  said  to  be 
similar in nature to the defunct Power Diskmag.. Not too hot on 'scene' 
coverage  of the sort that you might look for in here,  but a good read 
of  news,  reviews,  Sci-Fi,  and  general  writings from a hobbyist or 
enthusiast  point of view..  it even (just about with a bit of help and 
fiddling around) works on the Falcon.. Why not try an issue??

Symposium..
Now  an apology in advance of you reading the rest of this  issue  with 
respect  to  the  awesome amount of name-dropping that  cropped  up  in 
articles and reviews linked to this event.. If you didn't know that I'd 
been to Hamburg on that fateful Easter Weekend by reading the excellent 
and  comprehensive (if I might say so myself) report on the event,  you 
would  be left in no doubt by the time you've finished reading most  of 
our game and demo reviews for this issue!

YES WE'VE BLOODY WELL BEEN TO SYMPOSIUM!!!
 
By  the time you have finished reading this issue of Maggie,  you  will 
have  been  not so  subtly conditioned to vomit violently at  the  very 
mention of the word 'Symposium!'

Skynet Times..
Has  pissed  off  to the land of the dead..  I took over the mag  as  a 
deputy assistant caretaker editor sort of person for a couple of  weeks 
in February to give VoGue a hand with it..  Nothing happens, until June 
when the magazine closes.. Coincidence?!

Maggie 'Web Pages..
Yes  we have web space at last..  Not web pages as yet on the  Magnetic 
Interlude pages,  although Felice is still working on those apparently, 
but  a  wholly CiH inspired venture onto space kindly donated  by  Tony 
Greenwood..  There is a link to other diskmag related pages from there, 
including the Magnetic Interlude pages..  Details of what long extended 
and  ultimately pointless sequence of letters to type in to get  to  us 
can be found in the diskmag reviews column..

Atari/JTS merger..
Ho hooo! Not a lot you can say about this one that has not already been 
said.. Still, it keeps them off the streets I suppose..

Not  a  great deal else to report,  we have been quiet for a  while  as 
everybody  else  was,  so that is partly why this issue is late..  (The 
rest  of it is due to good old fashioned laziness!) The Maggie  current 
address  remains  in  force until the end of  the  year,  and  probably 
longer..  I  remain  happily PC-less for a while yet..  If things go to 
plan,  I  should  also be properly online before next issue  and  start 
roaming the phone lines yelling for articles from people who have  been 
un-harassed by me until now..

This  editorial is utterly shite and even getting me down!  Go away and 
read something decent instead!

 CiH - June '96
