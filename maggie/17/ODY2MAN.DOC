(C)1980 North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp.
Odyssey is a trademark of the Magnavox Company.

„CONGRATULATIONS!
CONGRATULATIONS!
CONGRATULATIONS!
€
You have just acquired the ultimate video game system!

Your Odyssey^2 is even more sophisticated than most arcade games.  It
employsstate-of-the-art electronic technology which was unthinkable
only a few yearsago.

It uses a tiny microprocessor, which is a miniature computer, to perform
complex electronic functions formerly accomplished only by far more
bulky andexpensive equipment.

Your Odyssey^2 has been engineered to give you many years of fun and
entertainment.  It is quite simple to set up and operate, but it is very
important that you read and understand the information contained in this
manual first.

YOUR ODYSSEY^2 CONSISTS OF:

        1 COMPUTERIZED CONSOLE UNIT
        2 HAND CONTROLS
        1 TV ANTENNA CONNECTOR

          PART NO. 702764-1
               or
          PART NO. 701702-9
 
        1 AC ADAPTER CORD
        1 GAME CARTRIDGE
        1 GAME CORD

First Install the Antenna Connector

Your Odyssey^2 will interconnect with any color or black and white
televisionset.  All you need is a flat-head screwdriver.

If you have a VHF antenna utilizing flat twin-lead wire, simply
disconnect itfrom the VHF terminals on the rear of your television set.

Reconnect this wire to the terminals on the TV ANTENNA CONNECTOR.

Now connect the flat twin-lead wire fromthe TV ANTENNA CONNECTOR to the
VHFterminals on the back of your television set.

If your VHF antenna cable is round with a screw-type connector (75 ohm), you
will need to purchase a 75 ohm to 300 ohm Balun to permit connection of
€yourTV antenna to the Odyssey^2 TV Antenna Connector.  The 75 ohm to
300 ohmBaluns are available from your local Dealer or any television
serviceorganization.

If you are using a 75 ohm round cable, your television will probably
have aset of jumper plates or a switch which must be removed to select
VHF-300 ohmterminals.  Your television instruction manual will be of
help.

Note: If you have only a UHF antenna, do not disconnect it from your
televisionset.  Just connect the flat twin-lead wire from the TV
ANTENNA CONNECTOR to theVHF terminals on the back of your television
set.

IMPORTANT!!  It is against Federal Communications Commission regulations to
cause any interference to nearby television sets.

* Please do not use any longer twin-lead wire from the TV ANTENNA
CONNECTORto your television set than is suppplied.

* Please do not make a direct connection from the TV ANTENNA CONNECTOR
to anytelevision antenna or cable TV outlet.

* Do not attach loose wires to your TV antenna terminals when your
Odyssey^2 isturned on.

"WARNING: This equipment has been certified to comply with the limits
for a Class B computing device, pursuant to Subpart J of Part 15 of FCC
Rules.  Onlyperipherals (computer input/output devices, terminals,
printers, etc.)certified to comply with the Class B limits may be
attached to this computer.Operation will non-certified peripherals is

Now Connect the Console

Then plug the GAME CORD from the CONSOLE into the TV ANTENNA CONNECTOR.

Check to make sure the Power SWITCH on the CONSOLE is in the OFF
position.  UPis OFF.  DOWN is ON.

ADAPTERjack is completely inserted into the CONSOLE receptacle.

Plug the AC ADAPTER into any standard 120 volt electrical outlet.

Set the switch on the TV ANTENNA CONNECTOR to GAME.

Set the channel of your TV to the unused channel (3 or 4) in your area.

Channel Switching

Your Odyssey^2 is normally set at the factory for operation on Channel 3
ofyour television set.  If a television station is transmitting on
Channel 3in your area, you can switch your Odyssey^2 to Channel 4
€opeartion.

Turn the CONSOLE over with the CARTRIDGE slot facing away from you.
Removethe three screws from the bottom of the CONSOLE.

Carefully remove the bottom of the CONSOLE.  You will find the channel
selector switch in a metal box located to the right of the printed
circuitboard at the upper right hand corner of the CONSOLE.  Move the
switch fromthe Channel 3 position to the Channel 4 position--then
gently replace thebottom of the CONSOLE.

Insert the Cartridge

Make sure that the POWER SWITCH on the CONSOLE is in the OFF position
(UP).This will protect the electronic components of both the CONSOLE
and theCARTRIDGE.

Hold the Odyssey^2 CARTRIDGE so that the label side is on the top of the
CONSOLE.  Push it in firmly.

When you remove the CARTRIDGE, always make sure that the POWER SWITCH on
the CONSOLE is in the OFF position.

TO PLAY

Be sure your TV is set to the unused channel (3 or 4) in your area.

Press the POWER SWITCH on the CONSOLE to the ON position (DOWN).

SELECT GAME will appear on your TV screen.  If it should not appear,
pressthe RESET key on the CONSOLE keyboard.  If SELECT GAME still
does notappear on the screen, check to make sure the AC ADAPTER
jack is completelyplugged into the CONSOLE and be sure that the
CARTRIDGE is properlyinserted.

The sounds of the game will be coming from the speaker on your
television set.Adjust your TV volume control to a comfortable level.

Adjust the fine tuning control of your television set to get the best 
possible picture.

ofthe CONSOLE to the OFF position (UP).

Safeguards

Do not remove or insert CARTRIDGES unless the CONSOLE is turned off!

Guide the CARTRIDGES into the cartridge slot of the CONSOLE.  Don't use
€force.

Clean exterior parts of the CONSOLE and CARTRIDGES with a soft, slightly
dampcloth.  Don't immerse them in water or spill liquids on them.

Keep the CONSOLE, CARTRIDGES, and HAND CONTROLLERS away from extreme
heat.

Avoid puncturing the keyboard. (Do not use pencils, penpoints or other
sharpobjects to press keys.)

Always turn the POWER SWITCH of the CONSOLE to off when not in use.

Only connect the CONSOLE to standard AC electrical outlets.

IMPORTANT: Turn off your Odyssey^2 each time you have finished playing
thegames.  Then unplug the AC ADAPTOR from the 120 v. outlet.  Note:

hourscontinuously, there is a possibility that the game pattern could
bepermanently imprinted on the picture tube screen.
