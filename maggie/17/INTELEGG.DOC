neiderma@er4.rutgers.edu posted this to rec.games.video.classic:

Playing Auto Racing, on the first track at the beginning
starter position, just drive on the "lower curb" on the grass right
below the road.  Go straight right and don't turn.  You'll drive
all over the "cartridge".

In Armor Battle, you can drive a tank to the bottom of the screen,
and then inactivate it.  Then take another tank (yours or enemies)
and shoot it once or twice to make it move down.  Then re-activate
the tank, turn it so it points straight down, and drive forward
for a minute or two.  The tank will appear from the top of the screen
and the tank will gain some "ghost tank" powers.

vsp@netaxs.com sent me an update for the easter eggs:

Note:  The Auto Racing easter egg is sorta incomplete, as you can go 
'off thecourse' and onto other courses at many places in the game.
Anywhere where there's daylight in between trees is explorable, and
often 'hidden' areas(like the "Drag Strip", a long horizontal area)
not mentioned in the manualcan be found.


Intellivision Quirks/Easter Eggs known:
---------------------------------------

Utopia:  On the right island, there is a two-by-three rectangle at the
upper left.  Just to the right of this block is a one-square bottleneck
with water directly above and below it.  Sail a boat (fishing or PT)
as if to sail directly into this bottleneck, and 'push' against the
resisting sandbar until you're as far as you can go.  Dock (press 0),
then move the cursor towards the land until the minimum needed to
control the boat is within the cursor, and select the boat again.
You should be able to sail directly over the land and come out on
the other side.

Triple Action: In the plane game, horizontal-flying bullets headed
directlyat the narrow spot on the upper half of the tower sometimes
fly rightthrough it, as if the tower wasn't there.

Bump 'N' Jump:  It is possible to jump off the left side of the screen
and land safely on the right, or vice versa.

Lock 'N' Chase:  If you stand in one of the tunnels (easiest with the
upper)and move continuously back and forth while partway off the
screen, eventually your thief will travel off the screen and disappear
altogether. After a minute or two, he will reappear on the other side.

If you have cleared all the coins in a maze, lock a door directly under
the top exit.  Run into this locked door from above; you will stick to
it.Then press up: the level will instantly end without your actually
havinggone out the exit.  (Hey, I never said these were really USEFUL
€bugs.)

You will often receive a bonus -- sometimes several thousand points --
if you are picking up a coin, vault $ or other bonus when you lose your
last life.

Pac-Man (Atarisoft):  On the title screen, execute the alternate Pause
command (1 + clear, I think).  The Atari symbol will lock up and become
extremely blocky, and you will have to reset the game.

For some reason, all fruits are actually worth double what they should
be.

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons:  Move so that a slow-moving monster (on
earlylevels, this is all of them, but blobs work best) is above you in
a long vertical passage.  Walk downwards until the monster is just
barelyoff the top of the screen, then quickly return.  The monster will
oftenbe cloned; with blobs, you can get up to three at once from one
original.It takes some practice to get the timing right.

B-17 Bomber:  If you start in practice mode and bomb the living hell out
ofEngland, the score will run out of numeric characters and start
displayingtext, graphics, and eventually some bonus items from Lock 'N'
Chase.
