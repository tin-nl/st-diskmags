Wotcher Doctor!

Here is the Maggie IMG convertor with docs. It should do everything
you want - the only thing i didn't put in was a 'drag and drop'
feature, i thought that would be a little excessive so you'll
have to use the good ol JEM fiyall selektore!

Also latest versh of BB2K with high score table thing at start.
The logo with be in the space of 288*48 but probably best to be
a bit smaller so i don't have to move the high scores right to
the bottom of the screen.

I'm waiting on some gfx from [name deleted to protect the guilty]
for bubble bobble, main things left to go in:

HURRY UP
EXTEND PIC
END LEVEL BADDY
INTRO/OUTRO SCREENS
FINAL LEVELS

not too much really but i am only really coding at weekends and
on days of, not quite as productive here as at home.

i haven't been into town since i last spoke to you, but when
i do i'll try to buy [Name protected to delete the innocent] for you.

i thought i might code a little handheld conversion (game and
watch on your falcon!) for the birthday issue of maggie. might
be fun.

good luck with your 2600 magazine!

any more help, give me a shout.

Leon.
