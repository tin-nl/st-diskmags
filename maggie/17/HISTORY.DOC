ˆTheHistoryofColeco€

Coleco (a contraction of COnneticut LEather COmpany) was the first
company to introduce a "dedicated chip" home video game system, with
the Telstar Arcade in 1976.  (The Magnavox Odyssey, based on Analog
technology, was the first home video game system overall, debuting
in 1973.)  Trying to build upon the enormous initial success of the
unit, Coleco decided to bring out nine different Telstar models.  But
within a year, 75 other manufacturers had introduced similar units, 
and combined with with production snags, a shortage of chips, and a 
push towards hand held games, Coleco skirted with disaster.  While
Coleco sold over $20 million of hand held games, it had to dump over
a million Telstar units, and the company lost $22.3 million in 1978.
With the introduction of units with games stored on interchangeable 
cartridges, Fairchild and then Atari had eliminated any remaining
market for the simple pong games.

On June 1, 1982, Coleco re-entered the fray with the announcement of
its "third generation" video game system, ColecoVision.  Touting
"arcade quality", ColecoVision took aim at the seemingly unassailable
Atari 2600.  Coleco wanted "Donkey Kong", a very hot arcade hit, to be
their pack-in.  In December '81, they went to Japan to make a deal with
Nintendo for the rights to Donkey Kong.  The Coleco executive wanted to
return to the US to show his lawyers the contract before signing, but
wastold to sign now, or risk losing Donkey Kong to Atari or Mattel,
who werecurrently going though channels to get the rights themselves.
Under thepressure, the Coleco executive signed.

In April '82 Coleco and Nintendo were threatened with lawsuits from
UniversalStudios who claimed Donkey Kong was an infringement on their
King Kong.Coleco had invested a fortune in the ColecoVision version of
Donkey Kongthat was only 4 months from its premiere release.  Thinking
that they didn'tstand a chance in court, Coleco decided to settle,
agreeing to pay Universal3% of all Donkey Kong sales.  Nintendo
decided to fight it, and some timelater actually won.  Coleco then
filed suit and got some of their lostroyalties back.

The bulk of Coleco's library, however, was comprised of overlooked
coin-opgames such as Venture and Ladybug.  With a library of twelve
games, anda catalog showing ten more on the way (many of which were
never released),the first one million ColecoVisions sold in record
time.  In 1983 it toppedsales charts, beating out Atari and Mattel,
with much of its success beingcontributed to its pack-in, Donkey Kong.
The ColecoVision soon had morecartridges than any system except the
Atari 2600, and with the 2600converter still today has more playable
games than any other system.

The ColecoVision introduced two new concepts to the home videogame
industry - the ability to expand the hardware system, and the ability
to play other video game system games.

The Atari 2600 expansion kit caused a flurry of lawsuits between Atari
and Coleco.  After the dust cleared, the courts had decided that it was
€acceptable for Coleco to sell the units.  As a result of this Coleco
was also able to make and sell the Gemini game system which was an exact
clone of an Atari 2600 with combined joystick/paddle controllers.

Coleco was also the first home videogame maker to devote the majority of
their product line to arcade conversions, using the superior graphics
of the ColecoVision to produce nearly arcade-quality games, albeit often
missing a screen or level.

Coleco truly shocked the industry by doing so well. In a year, the stock
rose in value from 6 7/8 a share to 36 3/4.  The following items were 
taken from Fortune or March 7, 1983:

"Six months ago, hardly anyone expected Coleco to ride so high.[Company 
President Arnold] Greenberg was known in the industry as a self-promoter 
overly sanguine about Coleco's prospects.  Says one security analyst: 
"He was always gilding the lily.  Wall Street developed a basic distrust 
of the company."  So did the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 1980 
it charged Coleco with misstating financial results to mask troubles."
 
"But almost overnight Coleco's image has changed.  ColecoVision, the 
 video game player introduced last August, is one of the most popular 
 consumer products around. The trade, paying homage to its technological 
 advancement, has dubbed it "the third wave" - wave one being the Atari 
 VCS, wave two being Mattel's Intellivision - and the most discerning 
 critics, kids, love it.  The 550,000 game players Coleco made last year 
 flew off the shelves by Christmas-time.  Coleco's sales nearly tripled 
 from $178 million in 1981 to $510 million last year, and the net income 
 shot up 420% to $40 million."

"Coleco's charge into the market last summer was well timed.  Atari and
 Mattel were engaged in a multimillion-dollar mud-slinging battle on
 television.George Plimpton in Mattel commercials lampooned the graphics 
 on Atari's VCS game player, while Atari blasted Intellivision's dearth 
 of hit games.  Then Coleco suddenly arrived on the scene with the best 
 of both: good graphics and good games.  With a greater amount of memory 
 allocated to screen graphics, ColecoVision provided a much better 
 picture than Atari.  Although ColecoVision at $175 was $75 more 
expensive than Atari's VCS,discerning video players were willing to pay 
a higher price for more lifelike graphics.ColecoVision's pictures were 
 also better than those of Intellivision, and the retail was $35 lower."

"To make ColecoVision even more attractive the company gave away with 
 each unit a $35 Donkey Kong cartridge.  "Donkey Kong was a very 
 serviceable gorilla," says Greenberg.  "Once we convinced the consumer 
 of the merits of the hardware, Donkey Kong pushed him into buying.""

"Another popular feature has been ColecoVision's expandability. 
 Accessories like the $55 Turbo module, a steering wheel, gas pedal, 
 and gear shift used to play a road racing game, can be plugged into 
 the console.  The company's $60 Atari adapter enables ColecoVision to 
 play Atari VCS-compatible cartridges.  Atari doesn't approve - it's 
 suing Coleco for $850 million, charging patent infringement - but game 
 addicts do.  Coleco sold 150,000 Atari adapters in just two months.  
€ Coleco's latest add-on, the Super Game module, was shown at last 
 week's American Toy Fair. It adds more memory to ColecoVision and 
 provides additional play variations."

"Coleco's software approach was to go after licensed arcade games and 
 to make cartridges for Atari's VCS and Intellivision in addition to 
 it's own game player.  Although Coleco hadn't built a single 
 ColecoVision when it was negotiating licensees in 1981, the licensers 
liked Coleco's plan to make products for all three leading game systems.  
 Coleco reached agreements with five firms, landing nine hit arcade 
 licensees. Last year the company sold eight million cartridges."

"Flush with last years successful foray in video games, Arnold Greenberg 
 predicts even more good news is on the way.  "We are a terror in the 
 marketplace," he boasts.  Greenberg proclaims that Coleco will increase 
 it's market share in video game players this year from 8% to 25%, 
 supplanting Mattel as No. 2."

"Achieving such lofty goals may be difficult.  Coleco last year paid 
 only $250,000 for the rights to Donkey Kong, but Atari later had to pay 
 an estimated $21 million to license E.T. for it's coin-operated and 
 home video games.  Late last year Coleco reached an agreement with the 
 game maker Centuri for licenses to three arcade games: Phoenix, 
 Vanguard, and Challenger.  Then just before the contract was to be 
 signed, Atari won the license by making a higher offer.  Parker 
 Brothers also outbid Coleco for the Popeye license.  "Coleco's position
 is still not assured," says Barbara Isgur, a security analyst at Paine
 Webber. "They were helped last year by the phenomenal success of Donkey 
 Kong.  What will they do for an encore?"

"Arnold Greenberg remains optimistic. He notes that Coleco has already 
 signed license agreements to bring out 30 new games by year-end.  In 
 January, Coleco made CBS the principal foreign distributor for it's 
 products.  In return Coleco will begin developing and marketing for 
 ColecoVision home video cartridges licensed by CBS from Bally, a major 
 arcade game maker."

Unfortunately, the ColecoVision suffered the same fate as the rest in
the great video game shake-out of 1984. Coleco's unsuccessful bug-ridden
ADAM computer only complicated the problem.  Some believe if it wasn't
for Coleco's Cabbage Patch Dolls,they would have completely disappeared.

Coleco stopped production of the ColecoVision in 1984.  Their last few
titles (Illusions, Spy Hunter, Telly Turtle, and Root Beer Tapper) were
barely seen in stores.  Soon after that, Telegames bought much of
Coleco's stock and even produced a few titles of their own that didn't
reach the shelves before the shake-out.

When Coleco left the industry they had sold more than 6 million
ColecoVisions in just two years, even with the last year being troubled
by the shake-out.  Many in the industry believe if it wasn't for the
videogame crash of '84, that Coleco could have gone through the 80's as
the system of choice, especially with its proposed Super Game Module. It
was clearly beating Atari and Mattel, but just didn't have the installed 
€base to last out the crash.
