|    Atari Inc. sometimes stamped a number in the upper left corner of |
|    the end label.  This number indicates the week that the cart was  |
|    manufactured.  There are three digits in the number; the last     |
|    number indicates what year the cart was manufactured and the first|
|    two numbers indicate what week of that year the cart was made.    |
|    EXAMPLE: a cart has "453" stamped on it.  So this cart was made   |
|    in the 45th week of 1983.                                         |
|           ^^              ^                                          |
|    Sometimes there is an "E" before the number and sometimes there   |
|    is an "R" after the number.  I don't know what those letters      |
|    indicate (e-mail me if you do!)                                   |
|    Note that Atari made the carts for Sears, so some Sears carts may |
|    have the numbers stamped on the end labels.                       |
|                                                                      |
| Note: Tony Rice discovered a very subtle variation in the Black      |
|    style label.  Look at the 6 in CX-26xx.  Some labels have a 6     |
|    that has a tiny dot in the center of the circle part of the six   |
|    where the picture shows through.  Others have a "filled 6" that   |
|    has a solid black dot that makes up the center of the circle part |
|    of the six.  Check out Yar's Revenge--I have 4 of them with a     |
|    filled 6 and 13 with a hollow 6.                                  |

| Note on cartridge types:                                             |
|    there are two parts to an M Network cart.  the long skinny piece  |
|    with the label and the fat end piece that allows the cart to fit  |
|    into the VCS.  There are two versions of the fat end piece: one   |
|    that says "M Network" and one that doesn't say anything.  The fat |
|    end piece just snaps onto the long skinny piece--its not glued or |
|    anything.  the cartridge variations listed below refer only to    |
|    the long skinny part of the cart and the label itself.            |
|                                                                      |
|    there are 7 different cartridge types for M Network games.        |
|    (they'll be described in detail in the next version of this list.)|
