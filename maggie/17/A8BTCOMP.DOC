Subject: 1.2) What is an Atari 8-bit computer?

In order of their release, the 8-bit Atari computers include the 400,
800, 1200XL, 600XL, 800XL, 65XE, 130XE, and the XE Game System.  The
400/800 models were first shown publicly in November 1978 and first
€sold in 1979.  The final machine, the XE Game System, was released
in 1987.  Atari Corp. officially dropped all remaining support of their
8-bit computer line on January 1, 199 .  [ <- I can't believe I forgot
already.]

The following text was written by Chris Crawford and appears in De Re 
Atari (Atari#APX-90008), a book published and copyright by Atari, Inc., 
1981-1982.  It has been very slightly modified here for generality.

     "The internal layout of the Atari 8-bit computer is very different 
from other systems.  It of course has a microprocessor (a 6502), RAM, 
ROM, and a (PIA).  However, it also has three special-purpose (LSI)
chips known as ANTIC, GTIA, and POKEY.  These chips were designed by
Atari engineers primarily to take much of the burden of housekeeping off
of the 6502, thereby freeing the 6502 to concentrate on computations.
While they were at it, they designed a great deal of power into these
chips.  Each of these chips is almost as big (in terms of silicon area)
as a 6502, so the three of them together provide a tremendous amount of
power.  Mastering the Atari 8-bit computers is primarily a matter of 
mastering these three chips.

     ANTIC is a microprocessor dedicated to the television display.  It 
is a true microprocessor; it has an instruction set, a program (called 
the display list), and data.  The display list and the display data are 
written into RAM by the 6502.  ANTIC retrieves this information from RAM 
using direct memory access (DMA).  It processes the higher level 
instructions in the display list and translates these instructions into
a real-time stream of simple instructions to GTIA.

     GTIA is a television interface chip.  ANTIC directly controls most 
of GTIA's operations, but the 6502 can be programmed to intercede and 
control some or all of GTIA's functions.  GTIA converts the digital 
commands from ANTIC (or the 6502) into the signal that goes to the 
television.  GTIA also adds some factors of its own, such as color 
values, player-missle graphics, and collision detection.

     POKEY is a digital input/output (I/O) chip.  It handles such 
disparate tasks as the serial I/O bus, audio generation, keyboard scan, 
and random number generation.  It also digitizes the resistive paddle 
inputs and controls maskable interrupt (IRQ) requests from peripherals.

     All four of these LSI chips function simultaneously.  Careful 
separation of their functions in the design phase has minimized
conflicts between the chips.  The only hardware level conflict between
any two chips in the system occurs when ANTIC needs to use the address
and data buses to fetch its display information.  To do this, it halts
the 6502 and takes control of the buses."

The 130XE and XEGS contain a small additional LSI called FREDDIE. 
According to Masstorage@closer.brisnet.org.au (Masstorage), "Freddy is
atype of memory controller.  It takes the address and clock from the
CPUand multiplexes it with the appropriate timings and signals to use
DYNAMICmemory.  Freddy also buffers the system clock crystal and
divides it downthen feeds that to GTIA.  The XEGS has a freddy but it
€doesn't have theextended RAM.  Even if it did, you would still need the
chip that does theREAL bank switching.  It is a small 16-pin chip
(Atari/Best Electronicscatalog number CO25953: rev9/page 42).  It gets
RAS from freddy, the bankselect bits from PIA, A14, A15 and the 6502
halt signal to control whichbank of 8 chips RAS goes to.  A14 and A15
then go to freddy for the addressrange of the extra memory bank (or
normal address range with no bankswitching).  The ANTIC/6502 select
bits in combination with the 6502 haltline, control the switching of
the PIA bank number bits to A14/A15 andwhich bank of memory RAS goes
to.  Why people say freddy does the bankswitching is beyond me.  An
800XL can look like a 130XE with that 16-pinchip installed (That's
right NO freddy) and an extra 8 RAM chips."

Subject: 3.5) How can I post to Usenet newsgroups by e-mail?

There are a several 'public' mail/News gateways. Each one has their own
ways for addressing syntax. The three most common ones are: 

           Site:    cs.utexas.edu
           Syntax:  newsgroup-name@cs.utexas.edu
           Example: To send to the newsgroup 'comp.sys.atari.8bit',
                    address the message to
                  comp-sys-atari-8bit@cs.utexas.edu

           Site:    newbase.cs.yale.edu
           Syntax:  newsgroup.name-news@newsbase.cs.yale.edu
           Example: To send to the newsgroup 'comp.sys.atari.8bit',
                    address the message to
                  comp.sys.atari.8bit-news@newsbase.cs.yale.edu

           Site:    decwrl.dec.com
           Syntax:  newsgroup.name@decwrl.dec.com
           Example: To send to the newsgroup 'comp.sys.atari.8bit',
€                    address the message to
                  comp.sys.atari.8bit@decwrl.dec.com

     Mail-to-news gateways of this sort tend to be overloaded.
     Therefore, please do not use these gateways or any other similar
     gateways if you can post to Usenet directly.

------------------------------

Subject: 4.1) How can I access the Merit/UMich Archive by FTP? 

     The Merit/University of Michigan Software Archives hold a huge
numberof files for many computing platforms, including the Atari 8-bit
computers.  Our 8-bit Atari Archivist is Jody Lenn,
mailto:lenn@atari.archive.umich.edu; the Atari Archive as a whole is
maintained by Mickey Boyd, mailto:boydm@atari.archive.umich.edu.

  The convention for Anonymous FTP sites is to accept "anonymous" as
your username, and your e-mail address as your password.  All of the
FTP sites mentioned in the FAQ list follow this convention.

          so GET YOUR OWN COPY of Lynx and install it on your system if

€Subject: 6.1) How can I retrieve files from the Merit/UMich Archive
through Gopher?

     The Merit/UMich Archive has a native Gopher server.  Try

gopher://gopher.archive.merit.edu:7055/11/atari/8bit

to connect directly to the Merit/UMich Archive's 8-bit Atari directory.  I 
personally recommend this method for downloading from the Merit/UMich 
Archive.

There is a channel on Internet Relay Chat for 8-bit Atari users.  Its
name is #Atari8.  Join #Atari8 on port 6667 (EFNet) and enjoy (if you 
meet somebody there).

There should be a small bot called XE_BOT on this channel.  While on

Subject: 9.1) What's this UUEncoding stuff (.uu, .uue files) all about?

     UUEncode/UUdecode is a UNIX utility that will convert a binary file into
100% printable ASCII characters, so that the file may be posted or maild
anywhere a text message can go.  The 8-bit Atari is perfectly capable of
UUEncoding/UUdecoding as well.  On the archives:

Subject: 9.2) What is an .arc file?

     A file with the extender .arc has been archived in a standard
manner thatis common in the MS-DOS world.  This is done to make the
file shorter,so it takes up less space on your disk and it takes less
time to transfer between computers.  The archives contains several 8-bit
Atari archivers fully compatible with this standard, including:

Subject: 9.4) What is an .xmo file?

This section by mailto:winston@merk.com (Winston Smith)
 
      In the recesses of my memory, I seem to remember ".XMO" as being a
"download extender" for the download section of one of the very early
ATARIBBSes such as A.M.I.S. BBS.  I seem to recall that ".XMO" implies
that thefile has been transfered with an early version of XMODEM and
has thereforehad CONTROL-Z pad characters appended onto the end of the
file.  Toretrieve a working file again, the CONTROL-Z trailer padding
needs to bestripped off.  A copy of the file is made, and then a
utility such as DiskDoctor (the original program, not the SpartaDOS
utility) / Download Doctoris used to strip off the trailing padding.
You probably could just loadthe file into TEXTPRO and just back over
the trailing bytes.  The reason toalways use a copy of the file is in
case of the rare instances where thefile actually ends with the
CONTROL-Z character.  In that case, you don'twant to back up all of the
way.  Bob Puff's SUPERARC was the program thatfinally saved everyone
from the task of manually having to strip off thepad bytes.  (Please
correct me if I am wrong.  In any event, that is what Iremember about
".XMO" extenders....)

Subject: 10.1) What 8-bit Atari emulators exist for other computing 
               platforms?

These are the emulators that are usable.

1) ST Xformer 2.55, from Branch Always (see companion Vendor/Developer
List for complete contact info).  A freeware 8-bit Atari emulator for
theAtari ST. 
  Merit/UMich: /atari/Emulators/stxf255.lzh

2) PC Xformer, from Branch Always (see companion Vendor/Developer 
List for complete contact info).  The 8-bit Atari emulator for 
DOS/Windows/OS/2.  Versions 2.0 and 2.5 are freeware; 3.0 is the
commercial version.

The following further info on PC Xformer provided by Bill Kendrick, 
mailto:kendrick@sonoma.edu.  Contact him for his Newbie/Emulator FAQ.

      2.0 emulates an Atari 800.  It requires about 300K of
      free memory, 320x200x256 (MCGA/VGA/SVGA) graphics, and a 286 CPU.
      It does not support ROM files, disk image swapping within the
      program, player/missile graphics collision detection, sound,
      PC joystick support, modem/printer support, but is free.
€
      2.5 is the replacement for 2.0.  It emulates either an Atari 800
      or an Atari 800XL.  It requires about the same as 2.0.  It does
      support ROM files and the PC speaker is used to emulate the old
      Atari 400/800 internal speaker clicks.  It is also free.

      3.0 is the first commercial release.  It emulates an Atari 800,
      800XL, or 130XE (128K RAM; I heard it was to do 320K but I think
      that was reduced).  It requires a 386 and 512K of memory.  It
      supports Sound Blaster, player/missile graphics collision
detection, modem/printer and PC joystick support.  It
      comes with a disk with the software, an ammendum to the printed
      documents, and a bunch of Atari 8-bit software (example programs:
    demos/games, and a few useful utilities).  It supports disk swapping
    through a (currently) simple menu.

      All versions support .XFD (Xformer disk) format disk images, and
      all versions of PC Xformer support SIO2PC disk images (.ATR's).

   PC Xformer 3.0 comes with a 36-page printed manual and reference.
   It includes appendicies explaining graphics, sounds, colors, BASIC,
   subdirectory paths (for MSDOS which in turn explains Sparta/MyDOS),
   a quick keyboard reference, ATASCII characters (all 128 drawn out),
   the Atari editor, error codes, file IO (commands, devices, XIO calls)
   as well as giving breif information on how to contact other Atari
   users, common file extenders, and it includes a LARGE glossary
   explaining Atari BASIC / TurboBASIC XL commands, Atari computer
   terms, and general computer terms.

Of importance to PC Xformer users is:
DcmToDsk, freeware by Jason Duerstock.  It converts most .DCM files into
SIO2PC .ATR's for use with SIO2PC and PC Xformer.

Subject: 11.2) Can I read/write 8-bit Atari disks on an IBM-PC?
€
     There are several programs on the archives of this variety.  Note 
that these require a DOS and disk drive on the Atari end capable of the
SS/DD 180K format (SpartaDOS, MYDOS, etc.; XF551, Indus GT, etc.).  The
programs are:

ATARIO by Dave Brandman w/ Kevin White - Reads SS/DD 180K Atari disks.  
  Merit/UMich: Diskutils/atario21.arc

SpartaRead by Oscar Fowler - Reads SS/DD 180K SpartaDOS disks.

Subject: 11.3) Can I read/write MS-DOS disks on an 8-bit Atari?

a) If your highest-capacity floppy drive on your Atari system is the
Atari 1050, you won't be able to use ATARIO, SpartaRead, or UTIL.  You
still have the following alternative:

Mule by Rick Cortese - Read/Write 180K MS-DOS disks with an Atari 1050
drive or equivalent.  Very limited.
  Merit/UMich: Diskutils/mule.arc,Diskutils/mule.exe, Diskutils/mule.txt

b) SIO2PC, described elsewhere in this FAQ List (section 12.4), can be 
used to read/write to a hard drive connected to an MS-DOS system.  This 
can also be a very effective file-transfer solution.

c) The XF551 3.5" Upgrades from Computer Software Services (see the
companion vendor/developer lst) allow the Atari XF551 disk drive to read
720K 3.5" MS-DOS disks. 

d) The Floppy Board, the add-on to the Black-Box from Computer Software 
Services (see the companion vendor/developer list), allows both low 
density (360K 5.25", 720K 3.5"), and, in the case of the Deluxe 
Version, high density (1.2M 5.25", 1.44M 3.5") external MS-DOS-standard 
floppy drives to be used on the Atari.  A utility is included to 
read/write MS-DOS formatted floppies in all supported densities.

Subject: 11.4) How do I transfer files using a null modem cable?

This section by mailto:cb541@cleveland.Freenet.Edu (James R. Gilbert)
€
A:  Simply put, you need a terminal program and an RS 232 port on
    each computer.  The RS 232 ports need to be connected
    together using a 'null modem cable'.

    For up to 4800 bps, no flow control lines need be
    connected.  Just cross the transmit and receive lines
    and join the grounds together.  (Transmit is pin #2,
    receive is pin #3 and ground is pin #7 on the 25-pin
    port.)

    The right hand pin on the 'long' side of a female 'D'
    connector is #1.  There are 13 holes on this 'long'
    side, 12 holes on the 'short' side.  The numbers go from
    #1 on the right to #13 on the left on the 'long' side
    and from #14 to #25 from right to left on the 'short'
    side. #25 is closest to being under #13.  A male
    connector is the mirror image of this.

    Most terminal programs allow a null connection, without a
    carrier detect.  Notably, '850 Express!' does not.
    
    A convenient way to make a null modem cable, up to about
    30 feet long, is to use two female DB25 connectors and
    some three or more conductor cable.  Using the two DB25
    female connectors allows unplugging your modem and
    plugging in the null modem cable.  This also avoids the
    confusion of the wide variety of serial port jacks on
    different computers.  Almost all computers connect into
    the modem via a DB25 connection.

    The SIO port on the Atari cannot be used directly.  An
    850 Interface Module, P:R:Connection, Multi I/O, Black
    Box (by Computer Software Services) or similar device
    that provides an RS232 port must be used.
    
    On the Atari, the port is a female DB9.  So you need a
    male DB9 to male DB25 modem cable to connect to your
    modem. So why not use this cable as your null modem
    cable as well?
    
    For higher speed connections, above about 9600 bps on the
    8-bit, you need the flow control lines.  You also need 
    a Multi I/O or Black Box, which use the PBI (parallel bus),
    then you can go higher than 9600 bps.

    Following are pin assignments for a DB25 pin RS 232 C
    port.
                 13                       1
                  o o o o o o o o o o o o o
                   o o o o o o o o o o o o 
                  25                     14
 
          (Above is female, male is mirror image.)
€ 
1.  Protective Ground        12.  Select Alternate Rate
2.  Transmit Data            15.  Transmit Clock (sync)
3.  Receive Data             17.  Receive clock (sync)
4.  RTS (Request to Send)    20.  Data Terminal Ready
5.  CTS (Clear to Send)      22.  Ring indicator
6.  Data Set Ready           23.  Select Alternate Rate
7.  Signal Ground            24.  Transmit Clock
8.  Carrier Detect
    
    A high speed cable would need not only pins 2 and 3 crossed
    but also pins 4 and 5 as well as 6 and 8.  Or better
    yet, make a true 25 wire, straight through cable and use
    a commercial null modem.  A commercial null modem is
    just a small device with the correct lines already
    crossed.

Subject: 12.4) How can I use an IBM-PC as a storage device for my Atari?

 Original by Dave Paterson, mailto:d.paterson2@genie.geis.com

SIO2PC is a cable and software combination that lets you use your PC as
upto 4 drives for your 8-bit.  Drives can be SD, ED, DD or custom sizes
up to 16 megs.  SIO2PC also lets you redirect the printer output to your
PCprinter or to a file on the PC.  High speed drives are emulated (a la
USDoubler).
 
All these functions are transparent at the Atari end; you never notice
thedifference between SIO2PC and regular drives, except that the SIO2PC
drivesare faster than any others (except Ramdisks and PBI interface
drives).

SIO2PC 3.19i is shareware by Nick Kennedy.
  Merit/UMich: Sio2pc/sio319i.exe

Of importance to SIO2PC users is:
DcmToDsk, freeware by Jason Duerstock.  It converts most .DCM files into
SIO2PC .ATR's for use with SIO2PC and PC Xformer.

Subject: 13.1) What's the best DOS for the Atari?

     This is a matter of opinion, but general consensus is that all
8-bit Atariusers should treat themselves to either MYDOS or SpartaDOS
to appreciate thepower of the system.  MYDOS is modelled after Atari
DOS 2.0S/2.5, but providessubdirectory and hard-drive support.
SpartaDOS is a completely differentcommand-line DOS modelled after
MS-DOS, though it is perfectly capable ofreading all Atari DOS and
MYDOS disks.  SpartaDOS 3.2g is disk-based; SpartaDOS X 4.21 is 
cartridge-based and includes many additional features.SpartaDOS is
available from Fine Tooned Engineering (see companion vendor/developer
list); MYDOS 4.53/4 is freeware from Wordmark Systems (Charles Marslett
and Bob Puff).
€     It is recommended that all 8-bit Atari users own at least DOS 2.5
forcomplete compatibility with existing software, and then choose
either SpartaDOSor MYDOS as they see fit.  DOS 2.5, MYDOS and SpartaDOS
are all available onthe archives.

The most important information is the voltage (in volts) required, and
whether you need a transformer (AC output) or an adapter (DC output).
Thepower (in watts) and current (in amperes) specifications of the
originalequipment as presented here should be regarded as minimum
values. Higher-than-specified power and current capacities are entirely
usable,and often preferable because such supplies run cooler and last
longer.

Subject: 13.5) What BBS software can be used on the Atari?

This section by mailto:winston@merk.com (Winston Smith)

Here is the run down of ATARI 6502 8-BIT BBSes that I am aware of:
 
  o  A.M.I.S. BBS --  The A.C.E. Message Information Service.
                      This BBS was written in BASIC by the Atari
ComputerEnthusiasts computer club (was it the Michigan chapter?).  It
includeddesigns for a ring-detector.  You needed a sector editor and
had toallocate message space by hand, hex byte by hex byte.
 
  o  F.O.R.E.M. BBS --  Friends of Rick E. Moose BBS.
                        At the time, there were a lot of BBSes around
called things such as "FORUM-80" and "BULLET-80", ergo the name.  FOREM
BBSwas the first truly RBBS-like BBS for the ATARI 8-bit.  It was
programmedin BASIC and was somewhat crashy.  I think that this is the
great-grandparent of the FOREM-XE BBSes that survive today.
 
  o  ABBCS --  The ANTIC Bulletin Board Construction Set.
               The user design of the ABBCS was very good.  It sported
features such as intra-line editors.  Unfortunately, the coding of the
ABBCS was really poor.  You could practically blow on your keyboard and
crash this BBS.  The BBS would sometimes crash several times a day.
 
  o  NITE-LITE BBS --  Paul Swanson's BBS with RAM disk.
                       Paul Swanson was a programmer from the Boston,
Massachusetts, USA, area.  I'm not sure whether his BBS for the ATARI
8-bithas been placed into the public domain or not.  This BBS was the
first tosupport a RAM-disk, which Paul Swanson called a "V:" device for
"virtualdisk".  This BBS was written in ATARI BASIC and required a
joystickhardware "dongle" device.  This was notable as being one of the
first ATARI8-BIT BBSes that could actually go for a week without having
to berebooted.  Pointers to the message base were kept in an ATARI
"very longstring" (for which ATARI BASIC is famous).  The BBS would
only haveproblems (for the most part) if this string became corrupted.
 
  o ATKEEP --  An ATARI 8-BIT version of CITADEL BBS.
               I believe that AT-KEEP, like FOREM-XE, requires the use
ofthe commercial BASIC-XE cartridge to run.  This BBS program was very
popular around Louisiana, USA, from what I understand.
 
  o Benton's SMART BBS --  BBS written in BASIC by Marco Benton.
                           This program is written entirely in BASIC.It
expects to be running under a SPARTA-DOS environment.This was a problem
€until very recently,when SPARTADOS was released into the public domain.
This BBS program uses a "modem clock string" rather than an R-TIME-8
cartridge in order to retrieve the current time.  It also comes with an
ATARI BASIC game door called "Sabotage".
 
  o FOREM-XE --  FOREM using BASIC-XE.
                 This version of FOREM BBS requires the commercial
BASIC-XEcartridge in order to run.  It is in the public domain and can
import andexport messages from the ATARI PRO! BBS EXPRESS-NET (7-BIT
text only,control ATASCII graphics are reserved for message
data-structure bytes).FOREM-XE BBS is still currently in use as we
speak, and may be reached viathe PRO! EXPRESS-NET as long as the
cross-networking "transnet" is still ineffect.
 
  o The BBS Express  --  PRO! BBS demo program.
                         This is the public domain version of
EXPRESS!-BBS,which is the Keith Ledbetter companion project of the
EXPRESS!-TERMterminal program of days gone by.  I am not familiar with
this program.  Ithink that it is written in ACTION! and only supports
XMODEM Checksumtransfers.  I have never called or seen this program
demonstrated.
 
  o OASIS JUNIOR III --  OASIS BBS demo program.
                         OASIS JUNIOR III is the -ALL MACHINE LANGUAGE-
demo version of the OASIS BBS program.  OASIS is very crash-resistant
andcomes with a "dial out" screen so that the Sysop can use the BBS as
aterminal program to call and fetch files without having to bring the
BBSdown and reload a terminal program.  OASIS supports "Door programs"
whichit refers to as "OASIS PAL modules".  This OASIS demo module comes
with anexcellent message system.  The OASIS file system is one of the
mostcomplicated that I have ever seen.  It consists of "file libraries"
withsuites of "file types".  There is quite a bit of overhead involved
inperforming a download (which may be a good thing, as it discourages
filehogs).  There is a commercial version of OASIS called "OASIS IV"
thatperforms networking.  There was an OASIS network between Boston,
Massachusets, USA and Murfreesboro(SP?), Tennessee, USA.  Occasionally
wordof the OASIS IV developers reaches the network from New Zealand or
Canada.
 
  o Frank Walters BBS --  I know nothing about this BBS except that F.
                          Walters wrote it.
 
 
     OASIS IV, CARINA, and BBS-EXPRESS-PROFESSIONAL! are all commercial
programs.  I haven't heard anything about OASIS IV and CARINA for a
while,but PRO!-BBS is still a viable commercial enterprise last that I
had heard.
