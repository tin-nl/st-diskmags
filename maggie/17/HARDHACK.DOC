7.0) Separate Audio/Video Hack                          by Sean Kelly

(The following is a modification which can be used to improve your
 ColecoVision.  The authors of this list and this modification can not
 be responsible for any damage done to your unit or person as a result
 of attempting this modification.)

This is a rather feeble attempt at describing the hack to the Coleco
Visionvideo game system to give separate audio and video outputs to the
system.
I am what I call an "Electronics Tinkerer" meaning I have no formal
education in electronics and basically only know what I have been able
tofigure out by ripping apart everything I own <grin>!

I am a collector of Classic video games and systems and ran across this
hack on one of the many ColecoVision systems I own.  It actually works
quite well and gives the on-screen images a much crisper look to them.
Audio is generally pretty poor on the ColecoVision and this hack doesnt
do much to help it.

In order to get things started you have to open up the ColecoVision by
removing the 8 screws on the bottom of the case.  With the screws
removed,the case is still something of a pain to open because of the
lip on theexpansion port, but just keep working at it and it will
eventually comeapart.  Next thing is to remove the screws holding down
the motherboarditself (three of them I believe) and take the
motherboard out of the case.On some versions of the ColecoVision the
aluminum cover is soldered tothe circuit board.  If this is the case
on yours, you will have todesolderit and remove both the top and
bottom parts to the aluminumcover.  Seteverything but the motherboard
aside and you are ready to getto work.

The person that did the hack on this system uses a small automotive-type
fuse block terminal to mount the components of the circuit board on.  I
have located it in the 1992 Radio Shack catalog (page 150) and it is RS
part #274-688.  It comes in a package of four for $1.29.  Here is a list
of the components used: AGAIN - I have no formal electronics education
and don't really know how to read all the weird symbols on the parts.  I
will do my best to describe them (I have also labeled them on the line
below for future reference - take note):

Transistor - No part # markings at all.  Only thing on it is a white,
red,
(T1)         and green stripe in that order from top to bottom.I assume
             this tells what kind/type it is?

             POSSIBLE (!) RS Part #276-1617   $1.98 (pkg. of 2)

Capacitor  - Electrolytic type with  part #N8408 on it.  It also has the
(C1)        marking "470uf 35v", but the "u" is one of the funny symbols
             that I have no idea what it means.

€             RS Part #272-1030    $ .99

Capacitor  - Ceramic Disc type. Only marking on it is an underlined "47".
(C2)

             RS Part #272-121   $ .39 (pkg. of 2)

Resistor   - I know these are defined by the colored stripes (See - I'm
(R1)         not a complete idiot!!  haha).  The stripes are: Orange,
             Orange, Brown, and Gold.

A/V Cable  - One Audio/Vid cable with the RCA plugs cut off on one end.

You will also need about 5 small pieces of wire around 4" long each.

We're looking at a total of about five bucks to do this so for parts
thatdonot come in packages of two or more, I would suggest buying an
extraone,unless you know what you're doing, in case you screw
something up.

The center connector on your terminal will be the ground for all the
components because it is the only terminal that sticks out on both sides
of the block.  The part the extends on the bottom will be used to mount
to terminal to the ColecoVision motherboard.  Directly to the right of
the RF modulator (big silver box on the motherboard) right under the
letter of the revision of the motherboard (the one I am looking at is
"J") you will have to scrape off a section of the green coating so you
can solder the terminal on the bottom to the motherboard.  After
soldering this bend the terminal block so that it is standing straight
up from the motherboard.

Since many of the components will be "tied" together, you might want to
connect them all to the posts first and then solder them later.  The way
I am going to describe how to connect them will (hopefully) make it as
easy as possible to understand.  The following is a listing of each post
numbered from 1-5, left to right, looking at the terminal block from the
back of the motherboard.  Looking at the "back" you will be looking at
the channel 3-4 switch as well as the RCA plug that is used to connect
the ColecoVision to the TV/Game switch now. Here is what goes on each
post:

Post #1 - The LEFT "leg" of the transistor.  I am looking at the
          transistor on the side that is curved - where you can see the
          color bands.

        One of the small pieces of wire goes from this post to the right
        leg of the disc capacitor on the ColecoVision motherboard
        itself marked "C22".

Post #2 - The CENTER "leg" of the transistor.

          One "leg" from the Disc capacitor.

       One of the small pieces of wire goes from this post to the
€       underside of the ColecoVision motherboard.  It will be EXTREMELY
       hard for me to explain where to connect this on the bottom of
       the motherboard since there are no markings on this side.  The
       only way I can describe it is to say that it is being connected
       to one of the components in the RF modulator.  The RF modulator
       is "outlined" in a sense on the bottom of the MB with solder
       because of grounding.  You need to connect it to the pin that
       has the marking "+12" at about 5 O'Clock.  This is the closest
       pin to he "+12" marking.


Post #3 - This is the GROUND post.One side of the resistor is connected
          here.

        The two ground wires from the RCA cables must be connected here
        also.  Each Audio/Video wire has two wires inside of it.  In
        general, one is shielded in plastic and the other is not.  The
        unshielded wire is the ground.  Connect the unshielded wire from
        each cable to this post.


Post #4 - The side of the Electrolytic capacitor (C1) that the arrow
          printed on the capacitor points to.

       This is where I am sort of unable to help you.  The positive
       wire from the Audio or Video wire needs to be connected to this
       post.  Since the RCA ends are cut off the cable I don't know
       which is which.  It should not damage anything by connecting
       them the wrong way, so you will have to take a guess.  One of
       them goes on this post and the other goes on post #5.

Post #5 -The other of the positive Audio/Vid wires gets connected here.

        One of the small pieces of wire goes here.  This one is even
        harder to describe than the one on post 2.  The "outline" in
        solder around where the RF modulator is mounted on the opposite
        side is where you are going to connect this wire.  Looking at
        the bottom of the MB with the expansion port facing you the part
        of the "outline" you need to connect this wire to will be on
        your left.  It's  small section of solder (compared to the
        section on the right) and is about 1.5-2 inches long.  Connect
        this wire anyplace here.

You now have one leg of the transistor(T1), one leg of the resistor(R1),
and one leg of each capacitor just hanging there right?  Connect all of
these together, but do not connect them to any of the posts.  Just sort
of let them hang there.

The person who did this to my system also has one other wire connected
to the bottom of the motherboard, but the other end of it has been cut
andis not connected to anything.  I assume this serves no purpose.


ˆCopying ColecoVision Cartridges€
€
Some ingenious hackers figured out a way to copy the ADAM Computer's
Super Data Packs to blank cartridges that then can be used on the
ColecoVision.  Most of the ADAM Super Data Packs were duplicates of
ColecoVision Cartridges, but contained an extra screen or other extras
the cartridge version lacked. - JC

FWIW,I've now seen both a Super Donkey Kong and Super Donkey Kong Junior 
cart.  The only extras I saw in Super DK Jr. were music during the level 
selection, and a fourth screen, but Super Donkey Kong adds some end-of-
screen graphics (the carry-away after screen 1 and falling girders after
screen 2) in addition to its fourth screen. - JH

Note that copying cartridges or software is a violation of copyright
law unless permission to do so has been received from the rights holder.
The above information is included for completeness sake only.

Also note that pirated and reproduction cartridges for ColecoVision do
exist.  Some dealers sell them; some refuse to.  Not surprisingly,
pirated cartridges are considered to have very little collectible value,
so be aware that they exist - particularly if you run across demo carts
and/or extremely rare titles.


ˆRepair Tips€

The following are suggestions for solving problems with your
ColecoVision.  The authors of this list and these tips can not be
responsible for any damage done to your unit or carts as a result
of attempting these fixes.


To fix a rolling picture/video problems:

The problem is with the power switch.  You'll notice that if you were
to jiggle it a little without turning the system off that it will make
a complete mess of your screen.  What I suggest is that you desolder
the power switch from the circuit board, take the metal cover off of
it and clean all the contacts and re-grease them after cleaning them.
Make sure the metal cover is REALLY TIGHT when you put it back on
though.
>From then on if you are very careful when turning the unit on/off it
should work OK for you.

If you still have a problem go to an electronics store... and get a
similar switch and replace it.  Nothing else you can do really. - 05

                                - - -

Sorry if this is stating the obvious, but you seem to have a combination
of an intermittent open and a heat sensitive component.

Get a can of "cold spray" made for isolating thermal intermittents:
should be a couple of bucks at a local electronics shop.  If you can
€get the box open and get to all the components, it should be fairly
straightforward to figure out which one is the bad guy.

Actually, by your description (starts good, goes bad after 2 minutes,
can be affected mechanically) leans towards a bad solder connection
(or socket it the darn thing has them).  It may be as easy as touching
up a few solder connections. - 06


To avoid an automatic level select problem:

One common ColecoVision trouble is that the controller ports break down
easily, causing symptoms such as the ColecoVision thinking the keypad is
constantly being pressed (which can cause the a game to be automatically
started, as the level select is essentially instantaneous).  A frequent
source for this problem is the high sensitivity to static electricity
which the controller port pins exhibit.  To avoid the problem, simply
don't touch the controller port pins unless properly grounded. - 08


To fix an automatic level select problem:

One possible piece which can be blown by static electricity at the
controller ports (see 8.2) is the SN74LS541N chip, a 3-to-8 decoder.
If this is the chip that's blown, then replacing this chip (a generic
component, available at any good electronics store) can solve the
problem. - 13, 15

Parts:

        A good soldering iron (with a very thin tip)
        Computer solder (thin)
        Solder wick
        Needle nose pliers
        An SN74LS541N chip
        Two 2.2K K27 resistor packets (optional/recommended)

Getting started:

Plug in and turn on the Coleco with a Donkey Kong cart inserted.  When
thegame automatically goes into play mode, note if the Mario moves
withouttouching the joystick.  If so, then the 1st player chip is
definitelydamaged.  If a two player game is the one automatically
started (whichseems to be the prevalent fail mode) automatic movement
of the secondplayer's Mario likewise indicates that the 2nd player chip
is certainlydamaged.  Lack of automatic movement does not rule out the
possibilitythateither or both chips are damaged; indeed, given the
automatic selectproblem,it's likely that at least one chip is
damaged.  But determiningthat onechip is certainly damaged can
minimize your work.

Surgery:

1) Turn off and unplug your ColecoVision, removing the cartridge.
€
2) Make certain that you are properly grounded, if possible.

3) Open the plastic casing for the unit.

4) Remove the metal cover from the board by desoldering it.  It just
   gets in the way so its better to remove it.  It is not essential to
  the working of the game, though it can be resoldered later if desired.

5) the bare board upside down and find the soldering connections for the
   SN74LS541N chip that you wish to replace.

6) Note the orientation of the SN74LS541N you intend to replace, so that
   you can be certain that you provide the same orientation for the
   replacement chip.

7) Take the soldering iron and solder wick.  Place the wick on one of
   the solder connections on the board.  Press the solder iron on the
wick.The iron will heat up the wick which will heat up the solder.
The solder will turn liquid and be absorbed by the wick.  This takes
some practice before you get the hang of it.

8) Absorb as much of the solder as possible from all of the connections
   to the chip you're removing as possible.

9) Flip the board back over and take the pliers.  This is where you have
   to get tough with your Coleco, and let it know who's boss!  Growl at
   it occasionally to let off steam.  Now, being careful not to
   harm any other components on the board, grip the defective chip with
   the pliers and pull and pry.  It's OK to break the chip because it's
   defective garbage anyway.

10)After forcibly removing bits of the defective chip from the board,
   remove any broken pins stuck in the board, extra solder, etc. so that
   the area that was occupied by that chip is clean.  Suck up the solder
   from the pinholes with the wick so that you can see right through the
   board through each pinhole.  Gee, your ColecoVision never looked
better!

11)Take the new SN74LS541N chip and gently install it in the board,
   inserting the pins in the pinholes.  Make sure that the chip is
   oriented in the same direction that the original chip was!  Gently
   bend the pins if necessary so that they all go in the holes.  Be
   careful not to press too hard as you might bend some pins that aren't
   properly aligned with their holes.

12) Flip the board over.  Take the solder iron and the computer solder
    and solder each connection carefully.  Isn't this fun?  Don't you
    feel like a computer technician now? :)

13) Optional/recommended: Replace the resistor packets on the port in a
    similar (though much easier) manner.  For these parts, note the DOT
    orientation when replacing.

€14) Put the board back in the plastic case to avoid shock.


To fix a broken roller controller:

When a roller controller will not register movement in one pair of
directions (up-down or right-left), the problem might be with the
infraredmotion detectors.  The pair of sensors appropriate to the
directionsimply need to be replaced with new off the shelf send and
receive sensors.

Jumping and contact problems can usually be traced to the bearings.
Sometimes these problems can be solved by cleaning the bearings;
often,however, the problem can not be solved. - 11, 14


To fix a dead cartridge:

Most cartridge problems are a result of bad (or no) contact between the
cartridge and the system.  Cleaning the cartridge and system contacts
with alcohol usually solves the problem.  As a last resort, a pencil
eraser or emery board can be used on the contacts of the cartridge. -JH
