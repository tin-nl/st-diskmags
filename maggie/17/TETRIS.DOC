Hell has frozen over! I thought for sure there would never be any 
more games released for the 2600 after Atari released their last four 
games in 1991. But here I am, four years later, playing Tetris on 
my 2600 - thanks to programmer Ed Federmeyer and distributor 
Randy Crihfield. Playing new software for my 2600 feels great. 
Ed designed and programmed the code for the game and Randy is 
handling the manufacturing on a limited basis. In other words, 
Randy is not going to be making thousands of these game cartridges. 
 
Ed and Randy sent me a demo copy of Tetris. The demo version 
does not have any sound, nor a title screen. The mechanics of 
the game are just like Tetris, however. Anyone who has played 
Tetris on any videogame or computer system will be able to 
immediately sit down and play a round of the game. 
 
Tetris shines on the 2600. I've always believed that the Atari 
2600 could effectively "handle" Tetris because it does not require 
fancy or elaborate graphics. I'm actually surprised that Atari 
never released a version. I believe they planned to at one time, 
but could not obtain the legal rights to do so.
 
For those of you who are unfamiliar, Tetris was originally 
conceived by a Russian named Alexei Pazhitnov. In the game, six 
different types of interlocking pieces fall from the top to the bottom 
of the screen. The object is to form solid horizontal rows by 
strategically placing the pieces. When a solid row is formed, 
the row disappears and points are awarded. As a piece falls, the 
player can rotate it, move it horizontally, or drop it to the bottom 
of the screen. When rows are not formed, the pieces stack up on 
top of each other. The game is over when the pieces are stacked 
to the top of the screen.
 
It's great to see this game on the 2600. I don't have many 
suggestions for improvement because Tetris is such a simple,
basic game. Perhaps that is why it is so effective on the 2600. 
One thing that would be nice to see is each row of pieces to 
be a different color. In the demo version, all pieces in each level 
are of the same color.
 
At press time, Ed is still working on his version of Tetris and it 
is not available for sale as of yet. He is putting on the finishing 
touches and hopes to have the game ready by February.
Ed also hasn't decided on an official name for the game, either. 
Tetris 2600, Edtris, and 2600tris are some of the possible names. 
€ 
I think we (the 2600 community) should all commend and congratulate 
Ed on his fine work. Not only is it a great game, but he is also 
the only developer out there creating and providing new games 
for the 2600. Let's hope Ed decides to create more!
