me a copy of whatever you are doing with it.

My plan is to have a 'newbie' part and a 'techie' part.  I still need
some more information about the following questions for it:

    Can a pause switch be built? (YES)
    Can the overlays be reproduced (MAYBE)
    Can a 3D color disk be made? (MAYBE)
    How does the light pen work and can one be built? (YES)
    How does the 3D imager work & can a Sega imager be converted?(MAYBE)

==========================================================================

Q. Is there a way to make a Vectrex joystick perhaps with autofire
capability?

Here is a FANTASTICLY well done description of how to convert a Sega
Genesis controller into a Vectrex controller.  Many thanks to Brian
Holscher <brianh@ichips.intel.com> for all his hard work in devising it
and generosity in sharing it.  I have made some *very* minor cosmetic
changes; thus the 2.0a version number.

        Using Sega Controllers with Vectrex
            (Revision 2.0a)

This Section explains:

€1.  How to convert a Sega Controller to work with Vectrex.
1.  How to make a Sega Controller to Vectrex Adaptor.
2.  Where to purchase a converted Sega Controller.
3.  Where to purchase a Sega to Vectrex controller adapter.


BACKGROUND

    Since my Vectrex controller is flaky, I bought a cheap Sega
Controller and converted it to work on the Vectrex.  From there I added
some nice features like autofire and re-programmable buttons.  I decided
to post schematics for those who want to make Vectrex controllers.
After talking with others on the net, I decided to build a Sega to
Vectrex adapter.  This is a little harder than converting controllers,
but I got one to work.  This posting includes info and schematics for
both.

    For those who don't want the hassle of making your own controllers,
I'm offering converted controllers and adapters for sale.  I'm also
offering a preprogrammed micro-controller for sale.


LIMITATIONS

    The Sega Controller is a digital controller.  The Vectrex joystick
is an analog controller.  Games like Minestorm don't look at the analog
values of the joystick and only look to see what direction the joystick
is moved.  Games like Minestorm work with these converted Sega
controllers.  Games like HyperChase look at how far the joystick moves
in a direction and are not fun to play with these converted controllers.

All (known) games work with these converted controllers and adaptors
with 2 exceptsion.  Hyperchase (all game variations) and Starhawk (game
variation #2 only) are completely unplayable due to the need for analog
controller data.


FEATURES

    This design incorporates a micro-controller for additional
functionality.  The micro-controller allows the user to program which
Sega Controller button maps to which Vectrex button.  This is useful
since the 4th button (called Start) on the Sega Controller is a smaller
and inconveniently located since it is normally reserved for starting
games on Sega systems.  The micro-controller even allows reprogramming
of the button assignments in the middle of a game.  Another feature is
auto-fire.  Any button can be set to auto-fire.  This means that the
micro-controller presses the button over and over again instead of the
player.


CONTROLLERS VRS ADAPTERS

    Adapters give you the advantage of using any Sega Controller with
€Vectrex and still be able to use it on the Sega system.  If you don't
have a Sega controller, a converted controller is less cost than an
adaptor plus the cost of a Sega controller.  Another slight advantage is
that the LED thats informs the user during button reprogramming and
auto-fire is easier to see on a converted controller.  The
micro-controller is optional if you are converting your own Sega
controller.  However, the micro-controller is required for the adapter.


BUYING CONVERTED CONTROLLERS

    If your don't want to convert a controller or make an adapter
yourself, you can purchase them from me.  You can also purchase a
preprogrammed micro-controller from me.

DOING IT YOURSELF

    First the Disclaimer.  I am not responsible for:
1. Any damage done to your Vectrex.
2. Any damage done to the Sega Controller.
3. Any errors in these instructions.

I'm not going to give step by step instructions.  I'm going to assume
that the reader has some basic knowledge of electronics and can figure
out what to do with the schematics and info presented here.  I will,
however, answer questions if asked.

Now that I covered my backside, here is how to do it yourself:

CONVERTING A SEGA CONTROLLER

The micro-controller is optional.  If you don't care about button
re-programmability or auto-fire, then just connect the button to the
connector pins as shown.

Notes:

1.  Pins listed are those of the 9 pin connector.

2.  I personally used a controller made by QuickShot since it was only
$12.87 at K-mart.  I've seen ones made by Sega for about $15.  Depending
upon which brand and type, the might be minor differences between these
instructions and your controller.

3.  On the Sega circuit board, you will need to remove the IC, pull-up
resistors for directions.  Leave the pull-up resistors for the buttons.

4.  Normally, pressing the direction pad on a Sega controller grounds
that direction input.  You will need to cut traces on the Sega circuit
board to isolate the UP and RIGHT ground from the the LEFT and DOWN
ground.  You will also need to isolate these two grounds from the button
ground.  This is because instead of grounding UP and RIGHT, you will
need to connect it to 5V.  Also, instead of grounding LEFT and DOWN, you
€will need to connect it to -5V.

5.  Thanks to David Vanderbyl for his suggestion of using 3.3K resistors
instead of a pots.


MAKING AN ADAPTOR

     An adaptor allows a Sega Controller to be used without modification
with the Vectrex.  A micro-controller is used to decode the output of
the Sega controller.  Sega multiplexes LEFT, RIGHT, and the buttons on
only 4 lines.  Since the Vectrex needs negative voltage for Left and
Down, two Optoisolators are used to switch the negative voltage.

Notes:

1.  Pins listed as Sega refer to the 9 pin male connector that the Sega
Controller plugs into.  Pins listed as Vectrex refer to the 9 pin female
connector that plugs in the Vectrex.

2.  Any Photo-Darlington Output Optoisolator should work.  Digi-Key
4N31IS-ND will work.  You can also get two optoisolators in one package.

Thats all.
Enjoy!

Q. What is Vectrex?

Here it is in layman's terms:

Vectrex is one of the most inspired video game machines ever produced
(but similar things were said about the Edsel and Titanic).  Its point
of distinction is the fact that it uses vector "line" graphics (as
opposed to raster "pixel" graphics).  This is the same type of screen
used in such arcade classics as Space Wars, Asteroids, Battlezone and
Tempest.  The machine has a 9 x 11 inch black and white screen and comes
with a built-in Asteroids clone called Minestorm.  The games come with
plastic overlays that slide over the screen to cut down on flicker and
give some illusion of color.  It uses one of the most advanced 8 bit
processors, the 68A09 (6809 with 1.5MHz clock speed), and a popular and
excellent sound chip, General Instruments AY-3-8192, which can produce a
wide range of noises.  Also included is a 1.5 inch, self-centering,
joystick with 4 buttons on the right.  It uses an analog/potentiometer
system allowing differing degrees of directional input.

The machine's footprint takes up a little less than a square foot of a
desk (in fact, it quite resembles a jet black Macintosh SE sans mouse
and keyboard), and can be operated easily in that area.  The joystick is
connected via a springy telephone-like cord and can be folded into the
base of the machine for portability.  The machine is moderately
transportable and very well constructed but, alas, very much extinct.
It made its debut late in 1982 and was quite scarce by the end of
1984 due to the Great Video Game Depression of '82 which forced Milton
Bradley (who bought the rights to the Vectrex from General Consumer
€Electronics (GCE)) to discontinue production due to to poor sales.
After this, the rights to the Vectrex and all related materials were
returned to the original developers, Smith Engineering.  Smith
Engineering has graciously condoned the not-for-profit circulation of
any duplicatable materials including games and manuals and is happy to
see it is still 'alive' in certain circles.

Here are some more detailed snippets from the service manual:

As a general description, the HP3OOO is a self-contained video game
system intended for home use.  The system includes its own 9" B&W
monitor screen and 3" permanent magnet speaker.  Plug-in ROM type
cartridges are available offering arcade type video and sound game play.
No external TV receiver hookup is needed or provided for.  A front panel
storable controller allows control over the game via joystick and push
button action switches.  For two player operation a second controller
identical to the single player controller is available as an accessory
product.  Both controllers attach to the main game console through nine
wire coiled telephone style cables.  There is a consumer power
switch/volume control on the front panel as well as a game reset button.
A consumer adjustable brightness control is located on the main console
rear housing.

For the technical description which follows, the reader is encouraged to
refer to the block diagram and schematic [not included here].

The HP3OOO is a microprocessor based, vector scan system using a
standard 9" black & white CRT as its video display device.  The
microprocessor (MPU) is the Motorola 68A09 device.  The MPU operates at
1.6 MHz from a 6 MHz external Xtal.  An internal divide by 4 circuit
generates the MPU 1.6 MHz "E" clock signal used in the system.  Program
memory is stored in the 8K x 8 bit 2363 type ROM.  This ROM contains
common subroutines, the "executive" or assembler instructions plus one
complete game.

Two 1K x 4 bit 2114 type static RAMS provide storage locations for data
indicative of locations of objects, game status, and various other
information needed by the microprocessor during game operation.
Peripheral Interface Adaptor (PIA) Chip, has two 8 bit peripheral ports
which interfaces the MPU with peripheral devices and external signals.
One of the PIA ports interfaces the General Instrument AY-3-8912
sound-I.O. chip with the MPU and also drives the digital to analog
converter chip MC1408.  The other PIA port is used as control lines for
the sound chip, selector control for the multiplex chip and as a means
to read the A/D comparator that's used in the joystick successive
approximation circuitry.  Sound is either MPU generated directly or by
use of the AY-3-8912 sound chip.

The AY-3-8912 sound chip is a programmable sound generator containing 3
tone generators and wave shaping circuitry.  This chip also has a single
8 bit I.O. port used to read the status of each of the hand controller's
4 action switches.

The standard TTL device types 74LS00 and 74LS32 are used as control line
€decoders to allow the MPU to select the appropriate circuit element to
be addressed at any particular time.

The analog processing section includes digital to analog converter (DAC)
chip type MC1408, dual 4 channel multiplexer/demultiplexer chip type
CD4052, and dual channel op-amps types LF353 and LF347.

DAC chip MC1408 receives an 8 bit word at data terminals D0-D7.  DAC
output (pin 4) is current source.  One section of IC LF353 is used to
change this current to a voltage representative of the 8 bit digital
word received by the DAC chip.  The LF353 voltage is applied to an input
of the dual 4 channel multiplexer (MUX) chip CD4052.  This same voltage
(designated "DAC" on the schematic) is the X-axis drive signal.

The CD4052 MUX chip serves two purposes:  it selectively couples, under
MPU control, the output of the DAC current/voltage converter to one of 4
places and is used to selectively couple the inputs from the joystick
pots to the voltage comparator IC LF353.

Q. Where is the Vectrex ftp archive and what is there?

The ftp Vectrex information archive is at ftp.csus.edu (130.86.90.1)
and is maintained by John F. Sandhoff <sandhoff@csus.edu>.

There are binary listings (2 flavors; pure binary from the ROMs, and
Motorola "S-format" dumps) for most of the games along with instructions
on how to burn Eproms.  There are several commented examples of code
demonstrating how to write both music and graphics.  There is also a
copy of the service manual and much more.  Almost all of the stuff is
bundled into a compressed file called "vectrex.tar.Z".  There are plenty
of experiments to keep an eager hacker busy.  Recently, some GIF/JPEG
files were added showing some of the screen overlays (there are also
GIFs of the 2 color wheels).  Also, text files of the manuals for most,
if not all, of the games are there.

David Wright <davewt@NCoast.ORG> will be putting the vectrex stuff up
his email server.  If you don't have FTP access, this may work for you.
If you want to try and get at it, the email server is at
"impinfo@Prism1.COM".  If your site doesn't like that, try
"prism1!impinfo@NCoast.ORG".  To receive a list of the files available
place "send vect.index" in the message body.  You can also add "send
help" to get a complete set of instructions.  Be aware that some of
these files are huge and may push you over your mailbox or disk space
quota immediately.

=========================================================================

Q. Isn't copying the games by burning EPROMs stealing or violating a
copyright?

If the system is "dead" then no money is lost by making copies of
something which otherwise would never be available.  Even so, it is a
€fuzzy matter and technically the answer should probably be, "YES."
Fortunately, Smith Engineering has given Usenetters permission to make
copies of all Vectrex related materials (manuals, games, overlays, etc.)
as long as it is for distribution to members of the group and as long as
it is not for profit.

==========================================================================

Q.  Do I have to make my own multi-cart; can't I just buy one from
somebody?

No; I mean, Yes, err...  There are at least 5 people making multi-carts
for resale on the net but the best ones (by far) are being made by Mark
Woodward <woodward@Newbridge.com>.  If you do not have email, you can
reach him by phone at 613/591-3600 during the day time (EDT zone)..

He is making multi-carts which don't require an old cart to be
cannibalized since he is getting PCBs made up for the job.  His carts
allow you to select the games via a menu on the Vectrex screen instead
of by flipping dip switches as all the others do.  The carts support the
RAM for Animaction and include a 'pause' button allowing you to pause
any of the games (my idea; thank you :).  They contain all the released
games plus the Test Cart and 2 hacked versions of Minestorm (infinite
lives and more shots).

The price breakdown is as follows...
$30 PCB + S/W selection
$20 EPROM (unless you can send me one)
$5  RAM (Optional)

If he builds it for you then there is $5 charge for miscellaneous parts
and you are obligated donate $10 to a local charity to cover his time.
This is in the spirit of the Smith Engineering agreement for
'not-for-profit' duplication.  The only 'profit' he get is from the s/w
selection code which he deserves and is entitled to because he wrote
(owns) it.  The games have been generously donated by Smith Engineering
and the parts are sold at cost (with a little to cover shipping).

To 1 complete, ready-to-play multicart costs $60.

The PCBs are made at a professional manufacturer and include plated
through holes, etc.  No hack and slash job here :>

If you want to build it yourself he can provide you with the PCB, a
programmed EPROM (or disk if you can blast your own) and a parts list.

==========================================================================

Q. How do I play <game X>?

Simple, read the manual.  WHAT; you don't have a manual?  OK then, read
the screen overlay (it lists the functions of all the buttons).  You
don't have the screen overlay either?  In that case most (maybe all by
now) of the manuals have been transcribed into text files and made
€available via ftp.  YOU DON'T HAVE FTP EITHER?  OK, I'll tell you what;
in the spirit of Smith Engineering's generosity, I will volunteer my
services as Vectrex copy shop.

I have all of the overlays and manuals (as well as some extra stuff like
the service manual, "Passport" magazine, the "Triton" and "Passport"
catalog pamphlets, and the "High Performance Machine" pamphlet) and am
willing to make copies for free to anybody that is willing to play by my
"rules".

You must send a Self-Addressed, Stamped Envelope (SASE) along with a
listing of everything that you want photocopies of (black and white
copies only; if you want color overlay copies, send $2.50 for each one
since color copies cost $$$).  You will receive double sided copies
unless you specifically request single sided ones.

I will fill the orders only about once a month so don't hold your breath
for a quick return.  Please note that these will not be replicas in any
particular sense.  I will be copying them as you would a book (I WILL
NOT REMOVE THE STAPLES TO REPLICATE THE SHEETS TO FACILITATE MAKING
EXACT DUPLICATES).  If you want exact duplicates, you will need to
modify the copies I send you (I am trying to keep my effort to a
minimum).

If I need to fold something to fit it in your SASE, then I will, so keep
that in mind if you want unfolded stuff.  The amount of postage is left
up to you to figure out; I am just going to copy, stuff, and send; I
will not verify sufficient postage.  Tips are appreciated (particularly
if you are asking for a *lot* of copying) but not neccesary nor
required; this is a free service.

Send SASE to:
   Gregg Woodcock
   2930 Dukeswood Drive
   Garland, TX 75040-8770
   U.S.A

P.S.  If you take advantage of either of these services, it would be
nice if you would "pay the community back" by transcribing at least one
document that is not currently at the ftp site and uploading it (or
emailing it to me and I will get it there).  I am pretty sure none of
the "extra" stuff I have has been transcribed yet.

P.P.S.  If you have an original service manual, please contact me so I
can get an copy of it (or buy it from you).  The copy I have is Nth
generation and is very hard to read...

==========================================================================

Q. How can I make a copy of a screen overlay?

With the advances made in the past 2 years in color scanners, copiers
and priners, it is now possible to make a near exact duplicate with the
push of a (few) button(s).
€
0.  First you need an original overlay, prefereably one with little
fading.
1.  If you want a "rough" copy, simply get a good high end color
    photocopy onto acetate (those overhead projector plastic sheets).
2.  If you want a better copy, you scan the image, preferably in color.
    I think 150 dpi is okay though some people may want to go for
    maximum resolution.
3.  Then you need a good paint program, I used Adobe Photoshop to do
some preliminary clean-up work, but I have a feeling it would take
quite a bit of work to make a perfect overlay.
4.  Prining--the critical part.  You need a color printer that can do
    acetate (animation cel) printouts.  Unfortunately, no color printer
    can work on thick sheets, which brings us to 5.
5.  You need go to to a hobby shop and get a piece of .045 thick clear
    sheet of [poly]styrene.  Its prtty cheap.
6.  The only part I haven't worked out, bonding the acetate overlay to
    the styrene.  It is probable that there are some mucho expensive
    color printers that professional print shops use that can print onto
    any thickness sheets but I haven't done much looking.

Thanks to Noel <NOEL@UMBC2.UMBC.edu> for this info.

==========================================================================

Q. My Vectrex is very noisy; is there anything I can do to make it any
quieter?

Here is what Daniel A Muntz <dmuntz@quip.eecs.umich.edu> said helped
him:  The noise isn't digital in nature and it closely follows the
video.  It also isn't a power supply problem; isolating the audio input
of the amplifier from the sound circuit revealed no noise at all.  It
seems the noise is generated in two ways:

1: By induction; Moving the audio cable around makes the noise less or
   more prominent.  It is at minimum when the cable is placed in its
   original manufactured groove.  Good design since that's farthest from
   the CRT yoke.
2: By ground impedance; Although all supplies are clean the hum is still
   present in the modulated dc difference between the two boards.

A definite improvement can be achieved by doing the following:

1: Rewiring the ground between the digital and video board.
2: Shielding audio circuit and changing cable to volume pot to a better
   shielded one.

==========================================================================

Q. My joystick wont auto-center anymore; can I fix it?
   (A.K.A. How do I get inside or open up my joystick?)

You can't make it "good-as-new", but you can repair it so that is is
usable again.  You must first mangle the sticker on the back of the
€joystick to get at the 2 screws that hold it together.  Just feel around
and you should be able to see where the holes are.  You can either try
to peel back the sticker (very bad idea) or simply punch 2 holes in it
so you can remove the screws (leaving most of the sticker intact).  Now
that you have the joystick open, remove the broken spring that used to
center the joystick.  Use the core from the largest available guitar
string to replace the spring you just removed.  If you snip off one end
you can remove the (usually gold) wire wrapped around a core wire by
pulling on the gold wire.  Credit goes to Dan Muntz once again for this
clever solution.

==========================================================================

Q. Are there tricks or cheats for any Vectrex games?

YES! (Vectrex had cheats back when they were still known as bugs):

ARMOR ATTACK:  If you crank the brightness all the way up, you are able
to see the helicopter's position as soon as you hear it (even thought it
is off the screen).

BERZERK:  The author of the game, Chris King, has confirmed that he did
indeed put an egg into Berzerk similar to the one in Scramble to get to
see his initials.  The problem is that he doesn't remember how to do it!
Luckily, we have a good place to start thanks to Pete Rittwage
<bushwick@netcom.com> who tells it this way...  I played my usual game
and got up to 10 minutes worth of scoring.  (I'm not that great, I can't
play up to the bug) so, I decided to search for eggs.  I started a new
game (reset) and walked immediately to the left (going into the other
room) then immediately to the right (killing me) with all three men.
When "Got you humanoid" appeared.  I pressed all four buttons
simultaneously.  The initials "CMK" appeared in the bottom corner.  The
funny thing is I was unable to reproduce it again, so it may be that it
wasn't all four buttons, or that you must have a certain score, or who
knows?  I tried to do the same routine again and it just immediately
starts the game again instead of showing the initials.  This was with
only one controller, pluged into the first player port, with the
original Berzerk cartridge.

Blitz!:  If you get a 1st and inches (1 and 0 to go), as long as you
stay on the 0 yd line, you keep getting first downs.  Thanks to Adam Fox
<adamfox@super.org> for this one.

FORTRESS OF NARZOD:  If you can somehow manage to kill the gorilla (AKA
the "Mystic Hurler") at the same time he kills you, your lives remaining
will turn into the infinity sign (oo) and you will have 255 lives.  It
is not known for sure if your lives in reserve value has to be zero for
this to work (probably so since this bug is probably due to an
accidental underflow from 0 to -1 which assumably would trigger the
software to be in infinite play mode to aid play/beta testing).  The
author takes credit for this one!

MINESTORM:  The brightness trick allows you to see the "invisible"
mines.
€
SPACE WARS:  Either ship is invincible after being hit, while pieces are
in the air.  This may not sound like much, or maybe this was
intentional, but I've played against people who make this their entire
strategy.  They skim the edge of the Star in the middle, just to knock
off a tail section or something, and then while they are invincible,
they fly right into you.  Not nice, but it works very well.  The time
window is surprisingly long.

SCRAMBLE:  A quote from Paul Allen Newell, developer of the game:  I
remember going thru long discussions with management about giving the
programmers credit on the games.  Western Technologies and/or GCE didn't
approve it and most of the programmers hide their names somewhere in the
games.  My "Easter Egg" can be located in "Scramble" by doing the
following.  If you have two controllers with joystick and buttons, put
them both in; otherwise, use the single one in the usual position.
While "Scramble" is displaying its "game # player #" section, move the
joystick so it is "down".  When "Scramble" starts, keep it in this down
position so your plane crashes on the floor BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS START.
Do this for all you ships, DO NOT PUSH ANY BUTTONS TO FIRE BOMBS OR
BULLETS.  When it is over, the display "end" will come up.  WITHOUT
TOUCHING ANY BUTTONS, unplug the main controller and move it to the
"player two" plug (if you have two controllers, this step is not
necessary).  Then, with the "player two" controller, PUSH ALL FOUR
BUTTONS SIMULTANEOUSLY.  They must all go down at the same time.  Repeat
until you get all four down at the same time.  You'll know when you see
the word "end" change into something else.  This is the first time I
have documented the method, having only mentioned it to friends or
hinted to others.  Enjoy!  (Thanks a LOT to Stefan Herr
<Steve@lioness.okapi.sub.org> for digging up this one-of-a-kind jem!)

SPIKE:  If you position the door ALMOST all the way to the right of the
screen, then jump into it, so as to be jammed between the door, and the
little space that is left; the game freaks out, you will be pushed
forward about 47,000 points, and the difficulty will be increased
proportionally.

Q. What is the history of the Vectrex?

A.  Thanks a lot to Stefan Herr <steve@lioness.okapi.sub.org> for the
following information he dug up while researching an article for a
European gaming magazine.  If you have any additions or corrections,
please contact both of us.  Thanks also to Chris King who sent me
personal email to fill some gaps.

VECTREX TIMETABLE
-----------------

End 1980/Spring 1981:  The development of Vectrex starts with an idea by
Jay Smith, head of Western Technologies/Smith Engineering, and his
talented staff for a small, vector scan table top game they call "Mini
Arcade".  It is possible that the real inspiration for the product may
€have actually come from Gerry Karr and/or John Ross.

Spring 1981:  The Vectrex idea is optioned to Kenner (known for their
"Star Wars", "Care Bears", "Batman" and "Batman Returns" figures).
Vectrex planned to have a 5" black and white tube.

06/1981:  Paul A. Newell is hired by Western Technologies to join the
"Atari reverse engineering project" group (aim:  be able to write games
for the VCS 2600) which at that point consisted of Mark Indictor and
John Hall.

07/1981:  Kenner declines to pursue the Vectrex.

08 or 09/1981:  The Vectrex concept is licensed by GCE (General Consumer
Electronics).  GCE's president Ed Krakauer had the vision to see the
great potential of the system.  To enhance its appeal, GCE asks that the
screen be increased to 9-inches.

Autumn 1981:  The Atari project is cancelled and the three Atari people
(M.I., P.N., J.H.)  start work on the Vectrex project.  John Ross
designs the hardware, Gerry Karr works together with John Hall on the
system ROM (called "The Executive").  In the beginning it is planned to
use a 6502 processor which turns out to be too slow.  For this reason
the 6809 is used finally.

Jan 1982:  Bill Hawkins and Chris King join the Western Tech.  They were
both students at Georgia Tech at the time and are hired by Ed Smith as
"Cooperative Education" students.  They are supposed to work for three
months and then go back to school.  Duncan Muirhead joins a week or two
afterwards.  He had just dropped out of a Physics PHD program at UCLA.

??:  A strict timetable demands that the first 12 games and the hardware
should be ready in June 1982.

??:  John Hall later exclusively works on "Mine Storm" while Gerry Karr
works on The Executive alone.  Gerry starts over from scratch and
changes the name to the RUM (Run Time Monitor).  In the end, a number of
people contribe to the RUM, most notably Duncan Muirhead who handled
most of the heavy trig stuff.

04/1982:  Paul Newell finishes "Scramble".  Mine Storm, Bezerk, Scamble,
Rip Off, and Star Trek were all completed at the same time.

06/1982:  The Vectrex is introduced to the public on the Summer-CES in
Chicago.

Summer 1982:  Mark Indictor, John Hall and others are directly hired by
GCE to write more games.  Paul Newell and Duncan Muirhead leave Western
Technologies to join Simutrek, a company developing arcade laser disc
games ("Cube Quest").  Chris King leaves 6 months later.  Noah Anglin
(former vice president of Atari) was hired by GCE as a consultant to
watch over the development of Vectrex.  It was a good deal for him since
he recruited the core of the software guys for his new company,
Simutrek, from Western Technologies.  Unfortunatly, this wasn't enough.
€Simutrek died on the vine.

??:  Mark Indictor and his family move about two hours out of Los
Angeles and he writes games in the seclusion of a pine forest at 5,000
ft.  He even has an NBC news crew come up and interview him for a news
show on weird computer hackers and their life styles.

Late summer 82:  Start of mass production.

11/1982:  Vectrex is available in the USA for $199.  Very positive
reviews in the magazines.  Paul Newell's "Scramble" gets the "Arcade
Award" of the "Electronic Games" magazine for the best "Mini-Arcade
game" (a category which is founded exclusively for the Vectrex).

Spring 1983:  GCE is acquired by Milton Bradley (MB).

03/1983:  Vectrex is announced in the German "Telematch" magazine for
the first time in Germany.

Summer 1983:  Distribution begins in Germany and many other west
European countries by Milton BradleyB (German office located in Fuerth).

1983:  Several efforts fail in developing a color Vectrex.  One obvious
project is to use a color TV tube; however, this is always too
expensive.  Another is to use a projection TV with three vector scan
tubes.  It works well but is commercially impractical.  Yet another
effort is to use two layers of color phosphor on a black and white type
TV tube.  By varying the high voltage level, the electron beam would
excite the bottom layer or the top layer.  However the high voltage
cannot be changed rapidly enough to keep up with the scan.

02/1984:  "Artmaster Lightpen", "Star Castle", "Polar Rescue",
"Animaction" and "Pole Position" presented on the "Nuernberger
Spielwarenmesse" (Germany's most important show for the toy industry).

around 02/84:  3D-Imager is presented at the Winter-CES in Las Vegas.

31/03/1984:  End of Vectrex in Germany:  MB in Fuerth announces stop of
sales on this date.

Rest of 1984:  Vectrex is phased out as Hasbro buys Milton Bradley and
video game fever comes crashing down (probable reason:  home computer
fever).  Rummage sales in Germany (mainly in stores of the METRO-chain,
which had bought the rest of MB's stock) close out Vectrex equipment at
bargain prices.

1988:  Western Technologie/Smith Enginerring tries to resurrect Vectrex
as a handheld unit.  It is to be based on the Sinclair flat TV tube,
which has fast static deflection at low power consumption and low cost.
However, the impending introduction of GameBoy causes the idea to be
scrapped.

10/1993:  A feature about the 10th anniversary of the Vectrex is
published in the German "Video Games" magazine.  Contains technical
€descriptions, pictures of Jay Smith and Mark Indictor, a Vectrex history
and a list of games and accessories.  The article is based on
information collected by the author (Stefan Herr) from the Usenet
Vectrex newsgroup, various FTP archives, many emails from several former
Vectrex developers and a historical overiew about the development by Jay
Smith.

There are not very many evidences of the existance of a computer
keyboard with a BASIC cartridge (or something similar) for the Vectrex.
The only known hints are from an article in an old issue of "Creative
Computing" magazine (in the first couple of pages they do a ranking of
computers' speed based on some simple benchmark.  There is an entry for
the vectrex in it using Vectrex basic) and an article about new
computers starting on page 114 of the October, 1983 issue of Popular
Science (A chart in the article indicates that the keyboard was to
include 16K of RAM, expandable to 64K.  The article goes in to great
detail about the computer add-on.  Thanks to Joshua See who is
unfortunately disconnected from the Internet.)

It is the issue that reviewed the original Macintosh (1984?).
